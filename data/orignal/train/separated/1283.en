Glory be to the father...
to the son...
Where is it?
to the holy spirit.
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
So help me god.
Where is it?!
Holy spirit...
Oh, for the love of Christ.
Damn!
Yum.
Tastes just like a ham-and-cheese omelet.
Except without the ham and the cheese and the omelet.
How did -- what?
No.
I am not playing "What not to wear"
at 8:30 in the morning.
Wh-- it's just pants and a shirt!
Well, it's just... you're meeting Jack today,
and I want you to look as good for him as you do for me.
Which is really good, by the way.
So you want me to wear my Alexander Wang dress?
You have an Alexander Wang dress?
No.
Besides, I'd worry less about what I'm wearing
and worry about yourself.
Well, what are you talking about?
Your earrings.
They're Chanel.
One of them is.
What?
Oh, god, what else am I missing?
Hopefully it's not something that rhymes with the word "Manties."
What?
Where's your usual confident demeanor?
Oh, I don't know. I just...
You know, I just -- I think that Jack is great.
And I just really want to make a good first impression.
Which is silly, because he's already met me,
so this is like a third or fourth impression,
And the science is unequivocal on whether...
Okay.
In this early and awkward stage,
let's not concentrate on what we're wearing.
Let's concentrate on remaining calm
and not scaring him off.
Right.
So, no talking about work.
Why? The body is endlessly fascinating.
Yes, it is.
But less so the insides. Fine.
Then what do I talk about when something work-related comes up?
Anything.
Oh, you say anything, but...
Okay, okay. Talk about puppies.
Puppies?
Yeah, everybody loves puppies.
True.
Inflammation on the intestinal track of puppies --
The outsides, Maura.
Everybody loves the outsides of puppies.
Keys.
Oh, see what happens when you get rid
of the Dewey Decimal System?
I'm fairly certain this isn't the work
of some killer librarian.
Victim is Brendan McHale -- dealt in rare books.
Ooh, how rare?
Some of the ones used as throw pillows,
they're worth several thousand dollars.
Ooh. Somebody went big papi on this safe over here.
Killer was looking for something.
Well, I doubt whatever's in there's worth dying over,
But I guess we'll find out.
BPD's still got a safe guy, right?
Tobin. He'll be here tomorrow.
That's not exactly the urgency I was hoping for.
Oh, he's at a conference in Las Vegas.
Why does everybody get to go conferences except us?
What would we talk about at a conference?
Baseball and how screwed up senior management is.
You want to travel across the country for that?
If there was an open bar.
Jane, Korsak.
The bruising indicates that each finger was broken separately,
in about five-minute intervals.
Frozen peas. Doubt he was making a side dish.
The moisture on the epidermis of the fully-broken right hand
is significantly higher than the left.
So the killer was using the frozen peas as an ice pack
to keep him awake while they tortured him.
Good times.
The vic's only employee is wondering if he can leave.
You want to talk to him?
This is Ricky Kelly. He works here at the book store.
He called us when he found Brendan this morning.
Who did that to him?
We don't know yet.
You have any ideas?
No.
How long have you worked here?
Little over three years.
Do you know if Mr. McHale
was having any problems with anybody?
No. Brendan made it a point to get along with everyone.
How did you end up working here?
No offense, Ricky.
But you hardly seem like the rare-books type.
Don't judge a book by its cover.
I think that's the saying, right, Detective?
Yes, but I'd still like an answer.
I needed a job, he gave me one.
Simple as that.
In our experience, things are rarely that simple.
You know what he kept in the safe?
Nope.
You know the combination or where he keeps it?
Nope.
Do you have an alibi for last night?
Nope.
Look into this kid's background.
He didn't seem too shaken up over his boss's death.
Which means he's either guilty,
or he's a 20-year-old street kid,
keeps his emotions to himself.
I think we should probably figure out which it is.
Can you write your contact information down
just in case we have any more questions later?
Please?
He died of shock due to an inadequate substrate
for aerobic cellular respiration.
He stopped breathing.
And his blood pressure also plummeted.
His heartbeat skyrocketed, his organs compensated,
shut down, and then he stopped breathing.
So, the torture caused him to die from shock.
Yes.
And it appears that the killer thought
that Brendan had passed out.
He tried to revive him with a slap,
and then with amyl nitrate.
But Brendan was already dead so there isn't any in his lungs,
but we did find traces of it
on the outer crest of his left nostril.
Hmm, well, we didn't find any poppers at the scene,
but I can have a team search the surrounding areas.
FYI, dead bodies not being able to inhale amyl nitrate --
perfect example of what not to talk to Jack about.
Jane, I hope you don't have dinner plans.
Oh, actually, we do. We're about to meet --
But... you were saying...?
The officer guarding the book store was attacked.
Our crime scene's been broken into.
What?
Yeah.
Great. I'm sorry.
Jack will understand.
Can you reschedule for tomorrow?
I will.
Okay, and remember...
I know. Catuli.
Ye-- no, puppies.
Yes, that's "Puppies" in Latin.
Maura, I just don't want you --
I know -- screw up a relationship
with the first guy I like who doesn't want to kill me.
Yes.
I was doing a routine perimeter patrol.
Next thing I know, I wake up staring at the ceiling.
And when you came to, that's when you made the call?
Yeah, immediately.
The guy, uh, must have heard me on the phone and took off.
I tried to give chase, but...
Woozy. Yeah, I get it.
Did you catch a glimpse of his face?
No.
But I could tell he was a big guy -- tall.
For you to say tall, he must be a giraffe.
Take care of yourself, all right?
What is so valuable that someone is going to break
into a guarded crime scene to get to?
Tobin the safecracker's still in Vegas.
I had the captain tell him to catch a flight back tonight.
We have an inventory of everything in the book shop.
Nothing of value's missing.
Well, whatever all this is about, it must still be in here.
I'll be sure to get two units to guard the place tonight.
Was Jack okay with us having to reschedule dinner?
Oh, definitely. He's very understanding.
He even made us a reservation
at a wonderful french restaurant.
Do they have toast?
French toast.
Yeah, set you up for that one.
It was right in my strike zone,
and I knocked it through the uprights.
And I've never been more proud to call you my friend.
You should have seen me last night.
Not even one slipup about a cold cadaver?
Nope.
But did you know you can cross a poodle
with almost any dog to make it hypoallergenic?
They're called doodles.
There are 50 different kinds.
There's labradoodles and goldendoodles,
and, my favorite, the schnoodle.
It's a schnauzer/poodle.
What happens if you cross one with a poodle?
Do you get a poo-poo doodle?
No, it's just a poodle.
We found a popper vial in the trash can near the book store.
I sent it over to the crime lab.
Great. Any word on our wayward safecracker?
He's meeting you at the book store in two hours.
Guess it takes that long to wash the Vegas off you.
Based on how he sounded on the phone,
I think you'll be lucky if he puts in any effort at all.
So, I finished the background check on Ricky,
that kid from the book store.
Beat cop in Mission Hills said he was a troubled kid --
ran with the bad crowd.
He was a regular at the precinct up there.
He been in trouble recently?
Oh, I'm glad you asked.
Two weeks ago, Ricky Kelly
tried to sell this illustrated page for 400 bucks.
How did he get caught?
Well, the buyer saw the straight edge
and was afraid it had been cut out of a rare book.
If Ricky was arrested, why didn't this pop up sooner?
He didn't get arrested.
When Brendan was contacted, he said the page was his,
but he refused to press charges.
So Brendan gave him a second chance?
Well, it's possible Ricky
was just doing the nickel-and-dime thefts
while he was waiting to get whatever was inside the safe.
When he got caught, he knew his time was up.
Solid theory.
Pretty sucky outcome, if that's what happened.
You're telling me.
Everybody needs money.
You think I'm gonna beat the hell out of him
for a couple hundred bucks?
We spoke to a cop in your neighborhood,
he said you were suspected of a lot of things.
I'll bet you didn't have good reasons for doing those, either.
I'm not proud of what I've done, but --
but t-they don't add up to murder.
I would never hurt Brendan.
All right, then explain this.
I sold those, and others too,
just to pay bills in the store.
Did Brendan ask you to?
He didn't know. Not until I got caught.
And then what did he say?
He gave me a dozen more
to frame and sell those, too, if I wanted.
Well, he's not dead because he's a bad businessman.
I don't know why he's dead. Okay?
Brendan changed.
About six months ago, he stopped caring about the store.
He stopped answering calls. He stopped returning e-mails.
We hadn't sold books in months.
I had to frame and sell these prints
just to keep the lights on.
You have evidence that you were doing that?
Yeah, I got all the invoices at my apartment --
what I got, what I spent the money on.
I wouldn't hurt Brendan, ever.
He came into the boys & girls club
about three years ago and asked for an intern.
He gave me a job, and that is what turned my life around.
When we first talked,
you said, "I needed a job, he gave me a job.
Simple as that." Now you change your story?
Yeah, well, the first time we met,
you said I didn't look like the rare-book type,
so I guess we'll just call it even.
Okay.
What happened to Brendan six months ago?
I don't know.
He stopped talking,
and he started going to church every day.
I thought it was because of me, and then it turns out
it had nothing to do with me.
It was just in his own head.
But you don't know why?
I wish I did.
Maybe I could have done something to help him.
I heard you got something off the amyl nitrate bottle?
Uh, no, it was clean.
Oh. So why did you call me?
I had a crime tech go back and get the trash-can lid
where the bottle was found, and...
five solid prints.
You're very good at your job.
Well, I have a very good light, but thank you.
Do they match anyone in the AFIS?
I didn't run it through the system yet.
I wouldn't want to overstep my bounds as the medical examiner.
But I've got them all set up
for you to do the search through the database.
You weren't really gonna run it through the system?
Oh, of course I was.
I just hadn't pressed "Enter" yet.
So, I heard you're dating someone?
I am.
It's... been a couple of times, but...
I mean, Jane hasn't even met him yet.
Well, I'm sure she'll like him. She likes everyone.
I mean, she likes everyone we like.
She's an excellent judge of character.
Speaking of Jane, where is she?
She's at the crime scene
with Korsak and the safecracker.
Donald Maxwell.
Not the type of guy you want to bring home to mother.
Not even his mother.
Is that a hickey?
What happens in Vegas.
What happens in Vegas delayed our investigation.
Yeah, I was at a conference.
Is that what they call the strippers' convention now?
They have conventions, too?
Looks like I didn't delay your investigation at all, Geraldo.
Someone was trying hard to break into an empty safe.
You know, whatever we've been looking for,
I'm not sure that it's been in here, at least not recently.
Maybe McHale knew the killer was coming,
hid it someplace else?
Yeah, hid it someplace else.
Or maybe...
the safe was just meant to be heavy.
Korsak, does that look odd to you?
Yeah, like somebody's been messing with the baseboard.
Hey, lover boy, can I borrow your crowbar?
It's Tobin.
You want me to do that for you?
You want me to hit you in the nuts with it?
Great hiding place.
Not that it did him any damn good.
Father Cowens?
And when we pried the baseboard off,
we found a book with this note in it.
I'll save you the trouble of reading it.
It says "Thanks."
So what was Brendan asking you to do, father?
If anything ever happened to him,
I was to take what I'd found to a professor McTavish.
McTavish? He at BCU?
No, State.
Why McTavish?
I don't know.
I was to tell the professor that the book was a riddle.
A riddle?
Yes.
Let me get this straight, Father Cowens --
You were willing to steal evidence
to help a buddy solve a riddle?
Brendan was an esteemed member of my church.
It was clear that something was weighing heavy on his heart,
and he needed my help to free himself.
I see that as my job, detective.
Isn't that what confession's for?
Well, I'm a fan of the ritual.
But it doesn't always give people what they need.
So he didn't confess anything
that seems relevant to my investigation?
Well, if he had, I wouldn't discuss that with you.
But no, he did not.
So how did you know he had troubles?
For years, Brendan's been a holiday catholic.
He'd show up for Easter, Christmas.
About six months ago, he started coming to Sunday mass,
And then morning mass.
And for the last few months, he's been the lay leader
dringing up the holy sacrament for daily mass.
Didn't take a rocket scientist to see
that Brendan was trying to fill some sort of hole in his life.
And when were you gonna go get the book?
As soon as you cleared out.
And my investigation would have been stalled permanently.
At least you're honest, I'll give you that.
I don't get it. It's a book.
It's old.
And, yes, old things are valuable,
but was Brendan McHale so down on his luck
that he's gonna let someone kill him
as opposed to turning it over?
Well, Bill Gates paid $30 million
for a codex of Da Vinci's.
And yet, no one is breaking his fingers to try and get it.
So my question stands.
And who is this McTavish guy
the priest was supposed to take the book to?
Do you know him?
Uh, he's a professor of literature at state.
I met him at a fundraiser for the library.
You know, he's a superhero
in the world of illuminated manuscripts.
Okay, first of all, that's not a world.
And even if it were, they would not have superheroes.
You know, he found the Gamea prayer book
in a library in Croatia.
It hadn't been seen in three centuries.
McTavish spent 15 years tracking it down.
So he's a nerd.
Big time.
But you know what's strange is he's an expert
in illuminated manuscripts from the middle ages,
and this book looks to be from the 19th century.
Nothing is ever easy.
Okay, so, how do we proceed?
Well, same as usual. No page will be left unturned.
Straight through the uprights. Very nice. Very nice.
How do I look?
Uh...well, that's a very challenging palette
for you, Angela, but you seem to be pulling it off.
Damn.
What can I do to look worse?
Ma, you look like a Russian nesting doll. What is up?
I'm breaking up with Sean today
and I didn't want to look too good.
To get him all hot and bothered
and then dump him would be cruel.
I-I thought that you liked Lieutenant Cavanaugh?
I do, very much.
But...?
But I'm re-thinking my life, and I need to let go of Sean.
And I don't want to hurt him.
Okay, well, ma, I can say with the utmost certainty,
you have never looked worse.
Thank you, sweetheart.
You're welcome.
This doesn't happen often.
But right now, I'm very confused.
Oh, yeah, you'll figure out that book
before you figure out my mother.
You didn't look hard enough, Donald.
We found it behind the safe in McHale's office.
Listen -- I've got you dead to rights.
We have your fingerprints on a trash can
near the scene of his murder.
So, I'm gonna give you a chance to make a deal for yourself.
Just tell me what makes this book worth killing a man over?
The sound of your voice is really starting to grate on me.
Look, I don't mind your silence.
Whatever you go to say, write it down.
Well, I've really enjoyed our little chat.
Oh, my God.
Don't freak out.
Why, because you've completely disemboweled
the key piece of evidence in my murder case?
I can put it back together in 10 minutes,
which is probably 5 minutes more than it took Brendan to make it.
He made it?
It's a Frankenstein.
The -- the pages, the front and back board,
the spine are all from the 19th century,
but the glue and the thread are less than a year old.
So, it's a counterfeit rare book?
Well, not in a meaningful sense.
A third-grader who liked rare books
would know it was a fake.
You and I were very different third-graders.
How much is it worth?
Approximately?
Ballpark.
Absolutely nothing.
I know. This is a setback.
Should I cancel with Jack?
What? No, we can't cancel on him again.
So we go, then?
Or is there a third Jane-ian option I haven't thought of?
I just can't figure out why someone is willing to die
to hide a completely worthless and fake book.
I just...
I'll cancel.
Hey, Ricky.
Hi.
You needed to see me?
Yeah.
Is this an okay time?
Yeah, sure. You want me to buy you a cup of coffee?
Actually,
I got my little sister in the car waiting.
I'm taking her to a soccer game.
Fun. How old is she?
She's 14. Yeah.
And, thankfully, nothing like me when I was that age, so...
get straight As, respects her teachers.
Nice, nice.
Yeah...
Anyways, I was seeing if I could
go back to the book store.
You know, I know Brendan wouldn't want it a mess,
and I just want to grab a broom and straighten it up.
Okay, let me check with the crime techs, okay?
See when they're finished.
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.
Sure.
I don't really...
I don't really know what to do with myself right now, you know?
Used to have a job, and Brendan expected things of me.
Right.
Well, you know, just 'cause he's gone,
it doesn't mean you can't expect those things of yourself.
Yeah.
Yeah, of course. Of course I can.
Do you know why this happened?
Do you know why someone would have killed him?
Not yet, no.
Yeah, okay.
But I-I'll call you as soon as I know, okay?
Yeah, thank you.
And thank you for checking on that book-store thing for me.
Sure. Anytime.
So, have fun.
Tell your sister I said good luck.
She -- she doesn't need it. She's fierce.
Okay, all right.
Was there ever a moment, professor --
year 11, year 12 -- where you thought,
"The prayer book doesn't exist, it's just a rumor"?
You looked for something for 12 years?
15.
Was it valuable?
Very, from an intellectual perspective.
What's that mean?
Well, in classic economic terms, the value of something
is determined when two parties come
to mutually agreeable terms.
But that's not possible when the object
is of incalculable cultural importance.
I'm not gonna lie to you, Dr. Isles,
there were moments I had doubts I'd never find it, but...
I'm just one of those guys --
I can't put down the crossword till I've finished it.
Perseverance -- secret of all triumphs.
Victor Hugo.
Well, from what I can tell, your assessment's spot-on.
Any reputable dealer -- excuse me --
would recognize the book as a fake.
Have you X-rayed for microdots?
Yes.
What about a fluorescent examination,
See if there was under painting behind the illustration?
Of course. Again, nothing.
So, you're thinking it's not the book itself,
but something hidden inside the book?
Exactly.
I'll take it back to the university.
Won't take me long to get to the bottom of this mystery.
No can do, Buckaroo.
Chain of evidence, we can't let it out of our possession.
But someone wanted me to see it.
And now you have.
Besides, however long it was gonna take you to figure it out,
I'm guessing she'd do it in half the time.
Well, very nice meeting you, Dr. Isles.
Buckaroo?
You have 7.1/2 years and not a minute more.
Are you feeling okay, Angela?
You don't look so well.
Thanks for coming to meet me.
Of course.
You know, I think you're a terrific person.
You're warm and funny, kind and chivalrous.
And that's a rare quality today.
And we have a wonderful time together,
and we share a lot of interests.
And I think we mix it up pretty good in the romance department, no?
Yes. Yes, we do.
But...?
But...
Unfortunately, I -- I just can't be with you anymore.
Why?
Okay, I know this is gonna sound wacky,
but I got a fortune cookie last week,
and it read "Start over."
And I-I kind of knew what that meant.
A fortune cookie?
Yeah...look, it's not about the fortune cookie.
It's about being ready for the sign.
And you're ready?
Well, I need to take a chance.
Be alone, without a man, for once in my life.
So I get to know who I am.
I understand.
You do?
Yeah.
All's I ever wanted was for you to be happy, Angela.
And if something in the cosmos told you
that starting over is the first step, then you take that step.
Wow, you're even more terrific than I thought you were, Sean Cavanaugh.
But I do have one last question.
Okay.
Where did you get that dress?
Do you like it?
No, not at all.
But that's okay, 'cause I remember
what you look like without it.
Guy doesn't move.
I saw him blink 20 minutes ago.
He's a well-trained monkey.
Makes me sick.
Me too, but there's nothing we can do about it
If he wants to lawyer up and ask for bail...
N-no... no, I-I meant the bread.
Just...everything makes me queasy.
Detectives? The suspect's lawyer's here.
Our cue to leave.
Korsak.
Well, well, well, look what the cat drug in.
Saw your lawyer today.
Your lawyer represents this guy.
Don't know him.
Donald Maxwell.
He's involved in the murder
of a book seller named Brendan McHale.
They're killing book sellers now?
What's next, the ice-cream man?
They broke his fingers one by one
until he died of shock.
Just seems like something they would do back in the old days.
You think I'm involved?
I didn't come here 'cause I missed you.
Right.
Well, in case you haven't noticed, I'm in prison.
In case you haven't noticed,
you're still the biggest crime boss in Boston.
I had nothing to do with this.
Okay, but maybe you still know some things.
The killer was looking for something.
Who sends this guy to find it?
How's Maura?
She's good. Really good.
Nobody sends Donald Maxwell to do something difficult.
He couldn't break wind without help.
Then why is he at my crime scene?
I don't know.
But he's just an errand boy.
An errand boy.
So, what -- maybe he's helping out somebody around Boston,
somebody who's not from here?
Sounds like Donald's speed.
Well, if he's driving somebody around,
maybe he's got to get back to them.
Thank you.
Jane.
Yeah?
Now can you do me a favor?
They're releasing Maxwell in 10 or 15 minutes.
Yeah, yeah, we'll be right behind him.
All right, bye, Jane. Drive safe.
Jane's gone? W-when will she be back?
She's going up to Wellington.
Penitentiary?
Yeah.
For the case.
Yeah.
You okay?
Yeah.
Uh, I got to go.
Surveillance.
He's stopping in front of 2264.
Make sure that's where he's headed before we grab him.
You let me go on bail.
Yes, we did. Aren't we nice?
Keep him quiet someplace else.
So, what do we do if he wasn't meeting up with our killer?
He's married and he lives on the south side?
He would have rushed home instead of rushing here.
Guess he's got a girlfriend.
So, it's heartfelt "I'm sorry" and a call to his wife?
Seems only right.
Let's go.
Police! Don't hurt me!
Sometimes it pays to be the slowest guy in the room.
You're here late.
Just trying to figure out what this book is about.
Right.
Anyway...
I know you saw Paddy.
Yeah, Frankie said he ran into you.
I was gonna tell you when I got back.
Look, you're just doing your job.
You don't owe me an explanation.
Paddy is being transferred to a supermax prison in Atwater.
Atwater's in California.
And why -- why are they moving him?
It's just a thing they do with high-security felons.
It keeps them from getting comfortable.
He said that he would like to see you before he leaves.
Do we have anything left to say to each other?
I mean, I don't know if you have anything to say to him,
but I think he feels like he would like
to get some more things off his chest,
you know, before it's too late.
But you don't have to go and listen.
Off his chest.
Yeah.
I mean, I think he just feels, you know --
Sh-- Maura?
取证实验室
Are you okay?
Brendan felt guilty.
Yeah, he -- he hired the needy intern
and was going to church.
Clearly, he was working through something.
And he was willing to die to protect this book
because he wanted Mctavish to have it.
But it wasn't Mctavish's expertise
that made him so important.
It was his persistence.
The riddle.
No, you looked. You didn't find anything.
Because it's not in the book.
It is the book.
Brendan wasn't trying to make a fake 19th-century book,
he made a book that pointed to the 19th century.
And Mctavish would have realized it
not as fast as I did, but still
that Brendan had hidden something with a technique
that was primarily used during that time
called fore-edge painting.
He was involved in a bombing that killed two people.
This is his confession.
What are you doing?
Watching her work.
Your sister?
No, the cop she's with.
She's British. Her name's Gillian.
She's got one of those accents, you know,
like James Bond and Mary Poppins rolled into one.
Oh, even insults sound good in that accent.
Yeah, I wish she'd insult me.
I'm such an idiot.
I took her to the break room
and I offered her coffee instead of tea.
Oh, the queen would be mortified.
Right? I got so flustered.
What, is she Scotland yard or MI6?
I don't know.
Probably not MI6,
or she'd have disappeared you over the coffee thing.
Basically, she started talking and I went into dreamland.
Tell me something, Korsak,
why do the brits sound so much smarter
and more sophisticated than we do?
Don't know. I'm like that with Hungarians.
I hear those guttural sounds, I'm Putty.
This is incredible.
How did you figure it out?
Are you some sort of bibliophile?
No, it -- it -- it wasn't me.
It was our resident everything-o-phile,
Dr. Maura Isles.
I don't know everything.
What's the capital of Chile?
She knows.
The victims were soldiers.
In all these years, we've never had a single lead
as to who was responsible for the bombing.
Mr. McHale's confession ties up all the loose ends.
One thing I don't understand --
why did he hide his confession in a book?
Why didn't he just turn himself in?
I think he was going to.
We still have active wire taps on some of the former members
of Irish-Liberation organizations.
We've been picking up anxious chatter
about someone confessing to the bombing.
His co-conspirators might have been getting nervous.
So, the book was like an insurance policy.
If something happened to him,
at least the truth would come out.
And he was right.
Now, with this, the forensic evidence you uncovered,
the people you arrested, and our wire taps,
we'll be able to close this case.
Thank you both for what you've done.
Victims' families have waited a long time for answers.
If you ever have something to tell me, just tell me, okay?
Don't use, like, codes
or invisible ink or talking animals.
A talking animal seems like the worst way to hide a secret.
Have you never seen a pirate movie?
Where are you going?
Uh, to see Ricky.
He's waiting for me in the break room.
What are you gonna tell him?
The truth.
You mean that sometimes people we love do horrible things,
but it doesn't have anything to do
with how they feel about us?
Something like that, yeah.
Or I could just talk about doogles.
Doodles.
Either way, I think I could use cross-bred puppies
as a metaphor for change.
I'm not sure if that makes any sense,
either from a genealogy perspective or an emotional one.
Or it could be brilliant and you just haven't realized it.
And it's Santiago.
Brilliant!
Okay, Ma, you sure you're not hurting yourself?
No, no. The body is meant to be flexible, baby.
Okay, I -- I don't think it's meant to be that flexible.
I think you're right.
All right, so, how did it go with Lieutenant Cavanaugh?
He understood.
What did he say about the dress?
Yeah, uh, he saw right through it.
He'll be okay.
What about you? Are you okay?
Yeah. I'm good.
Really?
Yeah.
I'm not in a relationship, I quit my job,
and I'll have a complete fresh start.
Ma, you quit your job?
Everything's got to change, baby.
For me, it's like I've got to tear down the house,
right down to the foundation, so I can start again.
You got another job lined up?
Nope.
This way I'll have absolute freedom from everything.
Right, but the absolute freedom part
sounds like absolute absence of a plan.
Well, that's how you figure out what you want to do next.
You're gonna have a lot of free time on your hands.
Yeah, I'm excited.
And this way, I'll be able to help you.
W-what -- you're gonna still stay here at Maura's?
Who knows?
Wait, you know my couch doesn't fold out, right?
Your earrings match.
You're eating cream cheese.
Uh, yes, I'm throwing caution to the wind.
Nauseous without cream cheese, nauseous with.
So I figured I'd pick the best option that has the most flavor.
Well, your mother's not the only one making changes.
Well, my first...
order of business is that I'm ready to meet Jack.
About that...
I've cleared my schedule.
My toast will soon be eaten.
I have even researched the doodle.
I'm seriously considering adopting a St. Bernadoodle.
They're very cute.
Well, I -- I had to cancel with Jack again.
Aw, why?
There's something that I need to do.
Something more important than Jack?
Yeah. And I could really use some company.
Yeah, okay.
I'll be right here if you need me.
