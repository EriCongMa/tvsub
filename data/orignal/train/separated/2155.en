I once saw a boar
kill a tiger in India.
This is serious business, okay?
I'll tell you why.
Boars are deadly,
unpredictable beasts.
They are everywhere on this island.
They are all around us right now.
They can attack without warning,
so you guys have to be ready to protect yourselves at all times.
You understand?
Good.
We're gonna talk about the kill zone now.
This is very important, okay?
Seriously?
Kill zone?
I am very sorry.
I thought you brought him here to teach them survival skills.
You brought Colonel Kurtz.
If it charges me, it's a 300-pound animal,
and it's crazy, okay?
It's gonna kill me.
Look... I made a terrible mistake, and I can see that now.
I apologize. Okay?
Hunters make the mistake, they think they can
get through the body armor of a pig.
Lucy, where you going?
Just getting my sweater.
All right, come right back.
The most vulnerable spot
is right between the shoulder blades.
This is my weapon of choice.
That's right.
It's got a 10.5-inch razor sharp.
Okay. Okay, I've had it.
I'm gonna go check on Lucy.
Make sure he doesn't kill anybody.
I-I-I'm pretty sure he won't kill anyone.
Where did she go? We good?
Yeah, we're good. Let's, um...
let's take this opportunity to talk about something else.
Something useful, like how to find fresh water.
Or, uh-- I don't know-- how to build a pillow out of-of
flowers, something like that,
something appropriate for the age group.
Yeah, we could definitely do that.
Okay.
Or...
who wants to learn how to do that?
You know what? There's something pathologically wrong with you.
You know that, right?
No. I'm gonna teach these girls
how to kill and gut a pig tonight, Danny.
That's a survival skill.
That's actually a horror film.
Has anybody seen Lucy?
She just went to go get her sweater.
No. She's not there. Lucy? Lucy?!
Okay, she couldn't have gotten too far.
Danny, why don't you check the camp bathroom?
Okay. I'll check the trail. Okay?
Lucy?
Lucy?
Lucy?!
Lucy?
Lucy?
Lucy?
Lucy?!
Here. I'm here.
Lucy, you can't go
wandering off like that, okay?
He needs help.
Who needs help? Where are you going? Lucy?!
His name is Ron. 50 years old.
Deep laceration on his leg.
He's dehydrated
and might be in shock.
That's about size of it.
That's a very thorough report, Lucy.
Thanks. Going for my first aid patch.
All right.
So, Ron?
Yeah.
What happened?
I went for a hike yesterday morning.
I slipped on some mud
and fell off this ravine,
came crashing down on a rock,
and it cut my leg up pretty bad.
Lost my phone
and all my gear. I tried to hike out of here,
but the pain was too much.
A man of his age and condition really shouldn't be hiking.
That your professional opinion, Lucy?
You know, I'm really lucky she found me
'cause I thought I was gonna die in here.
Well, you're not gonna die,
but we're gonna need to patch this up
before we move you.
You can use this.
Are you sure? It's gonna be ruined.
I want a new one anyway.
Okay. Your mom's gonna kill me.
All right, Ron.
Lift your leg, Ron.
Okay.
Okay, good.
Okay.
There you go. That's it.
I'm Steve McGarrett,
by the way. I'm with Five-O.
Oh, wow, you're a cop?
Yeah.
Oh, I got lucky.
Yeah. You're in good hands.
See if you can stand.
You all right?
Oh, yeah.
That's good. I can put a little weight on it.
They teach you that in cop school?
He's a Navy SEAL.
Really? Is he an astronaut, too?
Oh, this is perfect.
All right, walking stick.
Our camp isn't far.
Oh, you guys aren't out here alone, huh?
No. I got about a dozen aloha girls with me,
and I'm pretty sure they're all gunning for a first aid patch.
Right, Luce?
Yeah.
So you, my friend, are gonna be very popular.
Come on.
You know what? I feel pretty good, man.
I think I'll be all right.
Why don't you guys go back to the camp and have fun?
You're not gonna survive out here alone with this wound.
Just come on back.
I'll have the paramedics meet us.
Give me your phone.
Give me your phone
and the knife... now.
Now!
Plane's at the gate.
Shouldn't be long now.
Okay.
Thank you... again for... for being here.
I don't think I've ever seen you this nervous before.
He's your brother, okay?
Yeah, who I haven't seen in ten years.
And the entire time Michael was in prison,
he never let me visit, not once.
Adam, maybe he was embarrassed.
I mean, you were the golden child, right?
The college boy.
That's a lot to live up to.
Actually, in some ways, I was trying to live up to him.
Michael and my father were... very much alike.
So,
what does he think about you legitimizing the family business?
He, uh... he doesn't know yet.
Smile. We're on camera.
What do you think, FBI?
I'm sorry.
When you're a Noshimuri,
it, uh, sort of comes with the territory.
Once they figured out you've changed,
that'll stop, too.
Hey, he's here.
Welcome home.
Well, come here.
I missed you.
It's good to see you, brother.
Hello, beautiful.
Yeah, hey,
this is, uh... this is Kono Kalakaua.
Kono, this is my little brother Michael.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Adam's told me so much about you.
Or we can do that, sure.
It's gonna be okay.
Couldn't find her?
Get the kids back.
What?
Get 'em back, Danny.
Get 'em back.
Back up. Back up, guys.
Come on, come on, come on.
What's going on? Oh. What are you doing?
Don't even think about it.
All right, Ron, what's the plan?
They're little girls. They're no threat to you.
What do you want? I want all your cell phones
and your weapons. Throw 'em on the ground now.
Now!
Do as the man says. Come on.
Give me your cell phones.
You, too.
No weapon, okay?
All right,
here's everything.
They don't have weapons. They're children.
Ron?
My car at the end of the trail, okay?
Let the girl go, take my keys,
and get the hell out of here.
All right?
Don't be an idiot, Ron.
Go while you got a chance. Take the car.
Hey, listen to me. I know you don't want to do this.
Just let the little girl go. Please.
I'm getting tired of this guy, Danny.
No, no, no. Whoa! Ron's gonna do the right thing.
Right?
Everything's fine, right?
Something went wrong, we're gonna make it right.
Now just tell us what you want.
You, Mr. Navy SEAL survivalist,
you're coming with me.
Okay. Where are we going?
Going back in the jungle. I lost something in there,
and you're gonna help me find it.
Good. Let's go. You and me, Ron.
Come here.
Oh, right, and the minute
you get me alone, you snap my spine.
No, the kid's coming with us.
No, I don't want to.
No, no, no, Ron, she stays here. The girl stays.
Come on. Let's go, Lucy. Come here, baby. Come here.
Get back!
Danno!
Danny. Grace, get back.
Anybody else have any demands?
That's right, move. Everyone inside.
Go inside. Come on, get inside, Grace.
Danny, let me see that.
Just let me treat this.
No.
Lock it up.
Five minutes.
Lock it up!
All right, I'll be fine. I'll manage, okay?
Just do your best to get out and get some help.
Keep her safe.
I got it.
Let's go! Come on, lock it up!
All right.
I'll see you guys soon, okay?
Lock it.
All right, ladies, don't worry about anything.
We are gonna be just fine.
Okay, who wants to learn
how to remove a bullet from a gunshot wound?
Okay.
You can just keep it in for now.
All right, let's see what we have.
Okay.
Now remember, apply pressure...
until the bleeding stops.
All right.
Now, girls, go find some, uh, sleeping bags and blankets,
and let's try and get some shut-eye, okay?
Okay.
That's very good, I-I didn't know
that the Aloha Girls were trained in triage.
Yeah, well, my day job is as an ER nurse.
You did great.
Thank you, thank you, and I'm-- hey--
I'm really glad that I could, uh, provide
a teachable moment for everybody here.
We have to assess the situation.
The situation?
Well, for starters, we are locked in a supply shed.
I can see that.
Uh, how about a key?
I have a key, but
it's padlocked from the outside.
Well, I cannot break that door down.
Why not?
Because it opens inward, that's why not.
Well, uh, the supplies picture is not much better.
I mean, other than lanterns and cooking gear and sleeping bags,
we don't have much.
We have no water and no food.
No food, no water, okay, let's see about that.
Hey, ladies,
come on, let's gather around.
Okay, um...
All right, listen,
I used to be
a, a Boy Scout briefly.
I was kicked out.
That's a, that's a long story.
I'll tell you at another time, Grace.
Anyway, uh, I did go on a couple camping trips,
and this one time, uh, there was this kid Ricky Bonaducci--
Italian kid from Brooklyn,
he moved over to Jersey--
That's not the point. Anyway, he,
um, he-- one time he, he smuggled in
an entire rack of baby back ribs.
Very difficult to do-- big rack.
Okay, my point is this:
I know for a fact
that somebody here brought some food, so...
You got kicked out of Scouts?
That's not the point,
Grace, but yes, I did. Food?
It's against the rules.
That's exactly right, Caitlyn.
Thank you.
Forget the rules.
What about coming prepared?
Don't, please.
Whatever.
Anybody got any ideas, just throw 'em out.
Oh, wait a minute.
You got a crowbar or something like a crowbar?
A tent stake.
Okay.
Okay, good, no foundation.
All we got to do is rip up a
couple of these boards, we can dig our way out.
Hand me another one of these.
Grace, come here.
Everybody grab a stake, let's dig.
Come on, let's get these boards up.
Rip up as many boards as we can.
Where we headed, Ronnie?
Shut up.
Shut up-- that's helpful.
Listen...
I've hiked these trails a bunch, okay, I know this area.
You tell me where we're going,
I can help us get there quicker.
Yeah, I bet you're going to be a real helper monkey.
How you doing, Luce, you all right?
Yeah.
Stop talking.
No talking.
We're gonna go up here about two miles.
Go.
Two miles-- not this way.
Ron, the bridge is out.
How dumb do you think I am?
You want an honest answer?
You know what?
I am so sick of arguing with you! Quit trying to trick me!
I'm not trying to trick you.
Yes, you are.
Ron, listen to me, I'm not trying to trick you.
The bridge is out this way.
Well, we're going that way.
Fine, no...
Go!
Okay, whatever you say.
All right.
Move it.
Let's go, Luce, we're going this way.
All right.
Trust me, I know, it's a big change,
but I really believe our father would approve.
We are just as profitable in legitimate business
as we were outside the law.
Did you make this?
This is delicious.
Leonard's Bakery.
I'm not that good of a cook.
Listen, Michael.
I need to know that you're with me.
Okay, we've got a lot of repair work to do.
I need all the help I can get.
This is good for you.
Okay, this is good for the family.
I'm with you, brother.
That's great.
That's great.
So, listen, when you're ready,
I can set you up in whatever job you want.
You name it-- marketing, hotel management.
Okay, listen, listen, listen, listen.
Yesterday I was having powdered eggs on the mainline
with 3,000 other felons.
Now, I just need a little time before I figure out
what I'm gonna be when I grow up.
Of course, of course.
Take all the time you need.
Okay.
Well, I got a meeting.
I will see you later.
All right, you sure?
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm really happy you're home, brother.
Some crazy changes.
Yeah.
Your brother-- he's been working really hard
to legitimize your family business.
Yeah, I just never thought I'd see the day
I'd be running a hotel for my brother...
or having breakfast with his cop girlfriend.
Really is a brand-new world.
Hope that won't be a problem for you.
No, I'm cool with it.
Very cool.
How we doing, Grace?
I found a worm.
Don't worry, monkey, it's not gonna hurt you.
Come on.
My hand is out; I can see the sky.
All right, good job, baby, keep going.
Grace, you all right?
Come on, Grace, hey.
Hey, who's the best? You. Come here. Come on.
Madeline, listen, go to 'Iolani Palace
and don't stop till you get there, okay?
Got it. Grace, go with her.
It's dead.
Yeah, mine, too.
Look at this.
Guy cut the spark plug wires.
Can we start 'em another way?
No.
This little jerk Ron is smarter than I thought.
All right, ladies, come here.
Here's what we're gonna do.
All right, uh, Lily and Sara, firewood.
Zoe and Caitlyn, water source.
The rest of you, campsite cleanup, go.
Come on.
This is a mess.
Danny, that's blood.
All right, that's about the right height for Ron's wound.
I'm gonna get an evidence kit.
Danno, look, we found the cell phones.
That's good, monkey,
I got an idea those aren't gonna work, though.
But, like, one of the digital signal processors--
it's not broken.
Digital what?
It's like the heart of the phone.
The conversion chips translate the outgoing signal
from analog to digital
and vice versa.
Nope, try again.
If I take the battery from this one
and the motherboard from this one,
I might be able to get the phone to work.
Ah-- she's talking to me like I'm an idiot.
Listen, I don't know what you're talking about at all,
but if you can make that work...
Will she get a patch out of this thing?
All of 'em.
Okay, good, go ahead, go ahead.
What do you know? The bridge is out,
just like I told you.
Lucy, Lucy, drink some water.
Listen, stay behind me, okay?
You're doing great.
Okay.
All right?
Come on.
Keep checking that map; it's not going to change.
Would you shut the hell up?!
All right, shut up!
Hey, didn't expect to find anybody up here.
You guys lost or something?
No, no, no, we're just taking a break.
We're fine.
Oh, y-y-you're hurt.
Oh, I-I'm okay.
It's all right.
We're good.
We're about to get out of here actually.
We're gonna hit the, uh, Api Falls Trail.
Supposed to be beautiful.
You okay?
I'm okay.
All right, well, uh, good luck.
Shoots.
Actually I could use your help.
That was awesome.
That was an adrenaline rush,
and I needed it.
I think I could hike for days now,
but next time I'm shooting you.
Oh, hey, cuz.
What's wrong?
I want you to see something.
That was your guy?
What, are you spying on me now?
No, I wasn't spying on you.
A friend of mine in an FBI field office
thought I should see that.
See what?
Yeah, two people at the airport.
You'd better call Homeland Security;
they're holding hands.
I'm more interested in the guy you picked up.
Yeah, that's his brother.
Who was just released from prison, right?
So? Chin, he did his time.
For manslaughter.
Kono, Michael Noshimuri is a dangerous guy.
And I'm gonna bet that ten years at Pelican Bay
didn't change that.
Look, Adam changed, and you know it.
You trusted him when my life was in danger.
You called him.
You trusted him with my life.
I am very grateful for everything that Adam has done.
But it doesn't change the fact that
even though he turned over a new leaf, the Yakuza hasn't.
And I guarantee you they are not happy with his new direction.
Look, he's working on that.
And how does Michael feel?
Lieutenant Kelly.
Chin, can you hear me?
Danny, is that you?
Nice. It works. Good job, Riley. All right, shh.
Hey, you there, buddy?
I can barely hear you.
Aren't you supposed to be on a camping trip?
Yeah, well, that didn't go so well.
What happened?
We got jacked.
Is anybody hurt?
Aside from the fact that I got shot, no, everybody's fine.
Can't speak for Lucy and Steve.
Okay, we can have a chopper out to you in about 15 minutes.
No. No chopper. Listen.
Uh, this guy Ron hears it,
he's gonna know we got out.
Right now, our only advantage
is this guy thinks nobody's onto him.
Okay, there's a Land and Natural Resources station
about five miles from you.
We can have them rendezvous with you
and get everybody out of there.
Okay, good. Uh, please have them
bring me a satellite phone and a weapon.
As soon as everybody's safe,
I'm going after Lucy and Steve.
They got several hours head start on you.
You sure you can catch up to them?
He's got a bum leg. He couldn't have got too far.
I'm heading your way now.
Mahalo.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, so conservation officers are en route.
I'll stay on the line with you until they reach you.
Okay.
Thank you.
Here's your phone.
There's a 30-hour charge in it.
There's extra ammunition in there, too.
Thanks.
Oh, hey, do me a favor.
Take these to the HPD Crime Lab
and run it against CODIS.
I'm pretty sure that's our guy.
Will do.
Hey, how well do you know the area?
I don't know, I figured I'd take a cab.
Be careful, detective.
I don't want to have to rescue you again.
All right, thanks, buddy.
Hey. Hey, you.
Come here, listen.
Mom's on her way to come get you right now.
And I'm really, really sorry
about your camping trip getting spoiled.
I'm gonna make it up to you, I promise. All right?
What about Lucy?
Listen, I'm gonna do my best,
absolute best to find Lucy, okay?
I know you will.
You can do anything.
I don't know about anything,
but I'm gonna try my best.
Okay, come here. I love you.
Stay with this guy until Mom gets here, all right?
All right, let's get this show on the road.
Day's already half over.
No, no, no.
You're going back with the girls, you're not going with me.
Oh. And you're planning on what,
finding your buddy with the power of your mind?
You need me.
No, I'm actually pretty sure I don't need you.
Thanks, though.
Which way is north?
I know which way north is.
Lie.
How do you start a fire without matches?
How you gonna find fresh water?
What are you gonna do when you run into a bear?
A what? A bear? They don't got bears in here, do they?
See, the fact that you don't know that
is reason enough for me to go.
Look, you're injured.
I know these trails.
That is my camper up there.
My responsibility.
Fine.
Great.
Don't slow me down.
There's no bears.
At least let me look at the dressing on your wound, Ron.
It's fine.
You know how many germs thrive in this jungle?
And that wound is a breeding ground for bacteria.
All right, leptospirosis, necrotizing fasciitis.
Would you shut up?
Staph infection, fungal infection.
Look at yourself, Ron.
Okay, you dizzy? You got chills?
You got double vision yet?
Would you stop it, okay?! Stop it!
Listen to me!
Why?
Do it now!
You can't go on like this forever, Ron.
I don't need forever, Steve.
Go. Go!
Here it is again.
You see it?
Circular indentation. It's very faint.
Repeats itself every two feet.
It's... it's got to be that walking stick Ron was carrying.
Huh. You know, I got to admit, I never would've noticed that.
Yeah, well, my dad taught me how to track.
He was big into hunting.
I mean, tracking's just about prediction, you know?
You... your prey leaves you a clue,
you recreate what happened
and then try and figure out what it'll do next.
Sounds like being a cop.
Yeah, kind of.
You have a spider on your neck.
What do you mean? Where?
It wasn't poisonous.
Let me tell you something.
I hate this jungle. I hate jungles in general.
Every jungle in the world I hate.
And no disrespect, but I'm pulling Grace
directly out of the Aloha Girls.
All right, I'm putting her in ice hockey.
It's cold, there's no bugs
and no deranged kidnappers.
You know, you're the reason she does this.
I'm the reason?
Hey, this wasn't my idea.
I told you, I got kicked out of the Boy Scouts.
Yeah, well, she says it makes her brave,
just like you.
Brave like me. Maybe I'm not as brave as she thinks I am.
She's probably never seen you do that little spider dance.
Yeah. You know, I promised her
that I would bring Lucy back, right?
She thinks there's nothing I can't do.
I can do anything, right, but one of these days
she's gonna realize I am not Superman.
Probably, but it's not gonna happen today. See?
These tracks go right up this trail,
but in a half mile it dead-ends.
The bridge is out.
Well. You know what, let me take a look at your arm.
No, it's actually pretty good; you did a fantastic job.
Thank you.
Yeah, the bleeding stopped.
I think you're gonna live.
Look at this.
Okay, we got a parachute with blood.
Maybe this is how Ron hurt his leg.
So what, he jumped out of a plane?
Why?
Maybe because it was going down.
You're right, Danny.
Yesterday, a small plane
crashed in the jungle about five miles west of you.
According to the flight plan,
it passed right over your location before it went down.
Any survivors?
The pilot was found dead,
and the only other person on the flight was an armed guard.
He's missing.
All right, let me guess: Ron.
Yeah, he called himself Ron Rathburn.
Fong ran the blood that you found at the campsite
and got a hit.
His real name is Ron Alberts.
He has a couple third-degree theft convictions on his sheet.
He seems pretty small-time.
There's nothing to indicate
that he's capable of kidnapping.
Okay, well, maybe he's stepping up in the world.
You said he was an armed guard? What is it that he was guarding?
Well, the plane was transporting a couple million dollars' worth
of diamonds for a jewelry expo on the Island.
And no surprise-- the diamonds are missing, too.
All right.
This is it.
It should be here.
Look for a black backpack.
I-I don't see anything.
You sure you're reading that thing right?
These are the exact coordinates. It's here.
Is that it?
Yes! Good girl!
Good eye! All right, you're up, Jeff Probst.
Crawl up there and get it for me.
Half of these branches are dead, Ron.
It's not gonna hold my weight.
All right, kiddo,
you have to go up there and get it.
I don't want to.
Tell you what, sweetheart,
you go up there and get that backpack,
and I'll let you go.
Won't that be great?
Tell her how great it's gonna be.
How bad it's gonna be if she doesn't do it.
Lucy...
I'm gonna help you, okay?
Come on, it's going to be okay.
Come on!
Put your foot in my hands.
All right?
Push up.
Good girl.
Good girl.
There you go. Hurry up. Doing great.
Okay, yeah, put your left foot up there.
Okay, grab that big vine up there with your left hand, Lucy.
That's right.
Careful, careful.
Good girl. Attagirl, Luce!
Good job.
Okay, grab it.
Hold on tight up there, okay?
Come on.
Come on, right here.
All right, Lucy, good job.
Good job.
All right.
Okay, careful, Lucy.
Come on, hurry up. Hurry up.
Here you come, here you come.
Keep coming, keep coming. Throw it down.
Drop it! Drop it, kid!
Run! Run, Luce!
Toss the weapon.
Over there.
Do it!
Or she's dead.
Anything?
Shh!
Shh? No-no-no shush.
We just heard a gunshot.
Can you make the trail or not?
That's the stick Ron was using.
Okay, let me ask you a question:
where could they possibly be going from here?
And more importantly, what is this guy looking for?
I don't know.
There's nothing up here.
Whoa. You hear that?
What?
Help me. Help me. I'm over the side.
Oh, my God!
Buddy, hold on, all right?
What's your name?
Jeff.
Detective Danny Williams. I'm with Five-O,
all right?
Okay.
You've been shot.
I knew that guy was squirrely.
Squirrely happen to be with
another guy and a little girl?
Yeah.
She was scared. You know, I could tell.
How long ago was this?
Hour ago, maybe.
An hour ago? We heard a...
gunshot 15 minutes ago.
Yeah, I did, too. Yeah, that wasn't me.
We're gonna get you out of here.
Sit up.
Try to stand up. I'm going right behind you, all right?
Yeah.
You ready?
Let's do it.
Jeff, listen to me.
All right, we've got conservation officers in the area,
and they're gonna take care of you as soon as possible.
All right, yeah.
Now,
you didn't by chance happen to see
which way they headed before you were...
shot and thrown off of this cliff, huh?
Actually, the other guy mentioned, uh...
Api Falls Trail.
I think he was dropping a bread crumb.
It's not far from here.
Head north along the ravine about a half mile,
you'll see a trail marker.
I'll stay with him.
Thank you.
North?
Yeah.
Look at you, Mr. Wilderness.
All right, Jeff?
Yeah.
North?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, Danny, any news?
All right, I got a potential destination.
Api Falls Trail. I'm on it now.
Can you meet me?
I'm already at the trailhead.
HPD was about to tow a car when they ran the plates
and found out it was stolen.
Prints inside belong to a Wilson Hines.
He's wanted back on the mainland for several bank robberies.
I don't know who that is.
Yeah, well, your boy Ron does.
They did time together.
What are they, partners?
Looks like.
Ron gets a job as an armed guard,
steals the diamonds, and jumps out of the plane.
Hines is his ride out of the jungle.
But something goes wrong.
Ron screws up, gets separated from the loot.
That's why he needs Steve to help him find it.
Look, Danny,
Hines is dangerous-- the last time he robbed a bank,
a cop was killed.
He makes Ron look like amateur hour.
All right, I got it.
Once he finds the diamonds,
he's not gonna need Steve or Lucy.
Okay, you keep going.
I'll catch up with you.
All right.
Get up.
You are 24 hours late.
I had some technical difficulties.
I missed my jump window.
Look at my leg.
How the hell did you miss the jump?
The pilot tried to stop me,
so I had to throw the bag out of the airplane,
and then I had to fight the pilot.
But it doesn't matter.
'Cause we got the goods. No problem.
No problem?
I'm looking at two problems right here.
Well, okay.
"Well,
okay"?
You're traipsing around the jungle with two witnesses.
Uh, correction.
There's... there's a lot more witnesses than two.
This guy...
Tell him about the Aloha Girls.
He'll tell you about the Aloha Girls.
The what?
And the Five-O
task force that's looking for us right now.
But aside from that, you should be fine.
You'll get away with it.
Really? Not cool, man.
You know what? Shoot these guys,
'cause we got to go.
My leg is killing me. I got to see a doctor really bad.
My leg's infected.
What, you think we just walk into a hospital
and get them to stitch you up?
Well, I don't know. Maybe we'll go to the Urgent Care.
Maybe go to a witch doctor!
I've been through a lot
of trouble for you!
You had...
one job.
Jump out of a plane.
All you needed was gravity!
Well, I'm feeling pretty crappy!
Maybe it's time you did something!
I think you're right.
Chin, I heard gunshots. Was that you?
No.
He was dead when I got here.
No sign of Steve, lucy or Hines.
Okay, hold on.
Question now is, who shot Ron--
Was it Steve or Hines?
Whoever it was, they got to be close by.
Come on.
Is he coming?
Yeah, he's coming,
Lucy, but we got to... Hey, hey.
We got a really good lead on him, okay?
Lucy, listen to me.
I need you to hide here, okay?
I'm gonna lead the man away, and when it's safe
I'm gonna come and I'm gonna get you, all right?
I want to stay with you.
I want to stay with you.
Okay, Lucy, listen to me.
Come here.
I need you to be really brave.
Hey. You're doing so good.
I promise you,
I'm gonna come back, and I'm gonna get you, okay?
I need you to hide here
and just be as quiet as you can, okay?
I promise I'm gonna come back.
All right?
Okay.
Good girl. Okay. Come on. Come on.
That's it.
I'll be right back, okay?
Okay.
Just give me the diamonds,
and I'll let you go!
Go that way.
Lucy?
Lucy?
Lucy, my name is Chin Ho.
I work with Steve McGarrett.
I promise...
I'm not here to hurt you, okay?
Lucy?
Lucy?
Look.
I'm one of the good guys.
You have to help Steve.
That man is crazy. He tried to shoot us.
Okay. Grace's dad is out looking for him right now.
In the meantime, is it okay if I stay here with you?
Yeah.
Okay.
Do you want this?
Hold it!
Where are the diamonds?
Where are they?!
You know what?
I forgot.
You tell me where they are.
Uh, they're in the jungle.
Why don't you go and, uh, take a look?
I'll wait right here.
You think I'm playing games with you?
I will kill you.
You kill me,
you're really never gonna find them.
How's that, funny guy, huh?
Except no one's gonna find you either.
But I'm gonna find that little girl,
and I'm gonna kill her.
Right after I kill you.
Where's Lucy?
Where is she?
She's fine.
Chin called.
He's got her, she's safe. You all right?
Yeah. You?
Me? I'm-I'm, uh, fantastic.
You know, on the plus side,
we've figured out that camping is... terrible,
as I've always believed.
Are you kidding me?
These girls are never, ever gonna forget this experience.
Yeah, I'm hoping that they're repressing the memories as we speak.
Thanks.
Yeah, no problem.
So, how's the arm?
It also hates camping.
You know, this is a very special technique,
only a few people on the planet who can do this.
All right, look at that. Huh?
Golden brown. Cooked to perfection.
Crispy on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside.
I like them burnt.
You like them burnt?
Well, you, my dear, are a communist.
Okay? But you're adorable, so you can get away with it.
Go ahead.
What do you think?
Good.
That's it?
I talked to Lucy today.
Yeah? How's she doing?
Happy to be home. She said one day
she's gonna marry Uncle Steve when she grows up.
Well, we will not hold that against her, right?
I got something for you.
Yeah, what?
It's my Wilderness Survival patch.
I want you to have it.
Me? Aw, this is the best gift you've ever given me.
Thank you very much.
I love you.
Thank you.
I told you.
You can do anything.
Yeah, well, uh, there's one thing
that we both know I can do for sure very well
and that is order dinner. I'll be right back.
Coming. I'm coming
Hey. Hey, how you doing?
Good. How are you?
Not too bad.
Look at this, this patch my daughter gave me.
Aw, nice!
Nice, huh?
Keep the change.
Thank you.
All right, buddy.
Aloha.
See you next time.
