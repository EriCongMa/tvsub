because i &apos;m not wearing any underwear now .
then why do you have to wear underwear tonight ?
it &apos;s a rented tux , okay ?
i &apos;m not gonna go commando in another man &apos;s fatigues .
then somebody &apos;s gonna have to give somebody back his cushions .
okay . you hide my clothes , i &apos;m gonna do the exact opposite to you .
what , are you gonna show me my clothes ?
hey , opposite ...
... is opposite .
he &apos;s got nothing !
okay , i &apos;m ready .
rachel didn &apos;t have anything i liked but this ribbon .

i have seven minutes !
which shoes should i wear ? the black or the purple ?
just pick one , okay ?
oh , okay , okay . the black .
do you have black with little strappies ?
yeah . but those go better with pants . maybe i should wear pants .
yeah , pants ! what an idea ! or better yet , go without pants .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing , but just get in there ...
... and pick out any shoes that fit your feet .
i don &apos;t care if they match . i don &apos;t care if they make ...
... your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat . just do it !
go in there , pick something out so we can go .
all right .
thank you .
i &apos;ve got to call michelle to see if that was her voice .
it was . it was her voice .

just try to be
you &apos;re so sweet .
yeah , we were a great couple .
i know , i really miss him .
well , you know how it is . it &apos;s just that ....
you know what &apos;s weird ?
donald duck never wore pants .
but when he gets out of the shower ...
... he always puts a towel around his waist .
i mean , what is that about ?
i only beeped in so i could hear my own message .
i mean , that &apos;s allowed .
i would really appreciate it if you wouldn &apos;t tell your dad about
what do you mean , you don &apos;t feel comfortable with this ? we &apos;re friends !
that bitch always hated me .
i &apos;m calling her back .
okay , fine .
okay .
she &apos;s got a phone in there , right ?
okay , we &apos;re on it .
i know it says &quot; black tie optional ... &quot;
... but this may be pushing it a little .
i &apos;m not gonna go .
you &apos;re not gonna go ?
no , i think i &apos;m gonna catch up on my correspondence .
how can you not be going ?
i &apos;m not gonna go .
so i think that will accomplish the &quot; not going . &quot;
you know , just out of curiosity
ever since i was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends ...
... i &apos;m just , i don &apos;t know , not in a very museum benefit @-@ y kind of mood .
right . well , okay . okay . god , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry i yelled .
that &apos;s fine .
no , but you &apos;re mad .
i &apos;m not mad . i &apos;m just not going .
right .
okay .
you know that i have to go , right ?
so is it gonna be , like , i &apos;m abandoning you while you &apos;re upset ?
no .
no ?
you &apos;re not upset about the yelling .
right . and the humiliating .
well , of course , the humiliating .
so we ...
... we &apos;re okay ?
we &apos;re good .
right .
honey ? i love you .
yes , ross .

she &apos;s just getting dressed now .
is it wrong that i was totally aroused by that ?
okay , buddy boy , here it is .
you hide my clothes , i &apos;m wearing everything you own .
oh , my god !
that is so not the opposite of taking somebody &apos;s underwear !
look at me ! i &apos;m chandler .
could i be wearing any more clothes ?
maybe if i wasn &apos;t going commando ....
it &apos;s hot with all this stuff on .
i better not do any , i don &apos;t know , lunges .
okay , enough . enough with the lunging .
i &apos;m sick of this . i &apos;ve had it up to here .
neither of you can come to the party !
jeez , what a baby !
way to ruin it . i was just gonna go get dressed .
the only person i cared about getting dressed ...
... is the person who &apos;s not even gonna go .
look , rach , i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
look , i was a jerk , okay ? i &apos;m sorry i yelled . i want you there .
i need you there .
what can i do to show you how much i want you to be there ?
you could drink the fat .
welcome to an adult conversation .
no , no , no . now wait a minute . wait a minute .
that actually sounds interesting .
what ?
i think you should drink the fat .
okay , if that &apos;s what it takes to show you how much you mean to me ...
... and how much i want you there , that &apos;s what i &apos;ll do .
let me get you another glass . that &apos;s been sitting out .
i think this will be fine .
okay , vanilla milkshake . just a vanilla milkshake ...
... with chicken bits floating in it .
cheers .
no , don &apos;t ! okay , okay , i &apos;ll go . i &apos;ll go .
you will ?
