i got eyes on graham !
hey , where the hell is he going ?
buying himself some time .
can you believe this ?
she &apos;s been in hawaii 15 minutes ,
and she &apos;s already getting sworn in .
i &apos;ve been here for years .
well , pump your brakes there , mulder .
she &apos;s not official five @-@ 0 .
we &apos;re just swearing her in on a temporary basis
&apos;cause she &apos;s shadowing us
for a couple of weeks , that &apos;s all .
this task force has crossed the line before .
and they will again .
you just need to be there when it happens .
so this is the guy who &apos;s after us ?
yeah .
who is he ?
rex coughlin was an ia detective
who investigated me a few years back .
if it is an investigation ,
robert &apos;s gonna have people working for him .
i &apos;ve been under for months now ,
and i haven &apos;t seen anything
to warrant disbanding to indicting members of five @-@ 0 .
are you sure your relationship with chin ho kelly
isn &apos;t clouding your judgment here ?
you &apos;re gonna go back to five @-@ 0,
and you will stay under until you get something .
is that clear ?
left you a couple messages .
is everything okay ?
chin , there &apos;s something i need to tell you .
stop ! don &apos;t move .
well , this is a situation .
put down the gun .
or what ?
you gonna shoot me in the leg , too ?
from what i seen ,
your aim ain &apos;t too tasty .
was that fantastic chicken or what ?
what you do , you saving this for later ?
next time we &apos;ll get you a box .
come here .
what did i tell you ?
it &apos;s the best chicken on the island , right ?
it &apos;s just chicken , dad .
just chicken ? what are you talking about ?
that &apos;s like saying joe namath
was just another quarterback .
who &apos;s joe namath ?
who &apos;s joe namath ? you &apos;re breaking my heart , grace .
football !
that &apos;s right , football .
what &apos;s , uh , what &apos;s the matter with you ?
are you upset because i made you leave your phone in the car ?
we had a deal-- we agreed
that this would be a no @-@ phone zone , right ?
nice family time , right ?
i didn &apos;t agree .
i don &apos;t understand , what &apos;s so good about your phone
that you &apos;d rather sit staring at your phone
than having these moments with us ?
this is a father @-@ daughter moment .
we should cherish this .
well , that &apos;s why i need it-- to instagram the moment
and preserve the memory .
oh , preser ... see , &apos; cause , listen , when i was a kid ,
i didn &apos;t even have a phone ,
and despite this handicap , i still have vivid memories .
you know , the brain does a lot of very interesting things .
you know , remembering stuff is one of the things it does .
you should give it a shot sometime .
moani rose says if it &apos;s not instagrammed ,
how do you know if it happened ?
is this moani , uh , a philosopher ?
no , she &apos;s in my jazz tap class .
i see .
charlie , i got to tell you ,
this entire generation--
the phone is everything .
they @-@ they sit at a restaurant ,
they stare at their phone .
they go to a movie theater , they stare at their phone .
you know , if you picked your head up out of your phone
every once in a while , you might see
a much bigger , better picture out here in the world .
most of the time .
let &apos;s go , get your plate .
come on .
look at your sister .
she can &apos;t wait to go plug back into the matrix .
get over here right now .
i &apos;m gonna use your head to smash into this car , all right ?
brace yourself , brace yourself , huh ?
wow , your car is gone .
it &apos;s magic .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s , uh , magic .
i think somebody stole daddy &apos;s car .
wow , that sucks .
and you just got it fixed .
yes , i did .
you know , if i had my phone , we could call the police .
旧金山警局
come on in .
thanks .
i &apos;m sorry , steve .
when i found out what this was all about ,
i told coughlin i couldn &apos;t do it anymore .
i lied .
to you , to everyone .
yeah , you did ,
but you had an assignment-- you were following orders .
no one blames you for that .
we all understand how it works .
no , i @-@ i actually , i really mean that , abby .
by now , i &apos;m pretty sure i know
what type of person you are .
i can see your integrity ,
and on top of that , i think you &apos;re an outstanding cop .
you know the crazy thing about it ?
the whole cover story they made up--
shadowing your unit , seeing how you do things ,
why you &apos;ve had the success you &apos;ve had--
it worked , because it &apos;s the truth .
and what you &apos;re doing with five @-@ 0,
you &apos;re making a difference .
what are you gonna do now ?
i don &apos;t know .
i was under coughlin &apos;s supervision .
san francisco pd considers what i did
an act of insubordination .
if i go back , they &apos;ll take my shield .
reassign me to patrol .
i guess you better stay here then , help us .
why don &apos;t you think about it ?
i will .
thank you .
oh , by the way ...
... i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;d all like that .
i &apos;m sorry .
somchai .
somchai , land !
land !
land , somchai .
somchai !
somchai , wake up !
somchai !
where were they found ?
makaha beach . two men were clinging to a floatation device .
one of them was dead with a gunshot wound .
the other one &apos;s in icu .
when they pulled him out of the water ,
they found a revolver on him .
and we don &apos;t think that &apos;s the shooter ?
no , ballistics weren &apos;t a match .
all right , i &apos;ll check in with the coast guard ,
see if they had any distress calls
or shipwrecks in the past couple of days .
guys had to come from somewhere .
right .
although our victim sustained a gunshot wound ,
cause of death was ventricular fibrillation--
cardiac arrest-- as a result of hypothermia
within the last 24 hours .
any idea who he is ?
based on prints ,
i was able to establish our victim &apos;s name
is somchai wattana .
however , according to thai government reports ...
... our victim was executed by firing squad
at bang kwang central prison in june , 2009,
on drug trafficking charges .
that &apos;s over six years ago .
how is that possible ?
i don &apos;t know , but apparently ,
this isn &apos;t the first time our victim has died .
why can &apos;t we just use
the restaurant &apos;s phone and call a cab ?
you got $ 1,000 ?
that &apos;s what it would cost
taking a cab back into town , all right ?
with the traffic , we &apos;re in the middle of nowhere , all right ?
what about uncle steve ?
what about uncle steve ?
maybe he can come pick us up .
you always talk about how much he loves driving .
no . we don &apos;t need to bother uncle steve with this .
more importantly , uncle steve does not need to know
that this happened to my car ever .
besides , this is good .
it &apos;s good for both of you . you know ?
when i was a kid , i rode the bus all the time .
it &apos;s good for you . it &apos;s character @-@ building .
know what i mean ?
it &apos;s good for the environment .
you sit on a bus , you relax ,
maybe read a book ,
meet ... interesting people and ...
come on , stand up .
come on , buddy .
detective williams !
hey , mamo .
howzit ?
what &apos;s up , buddy ? how you doing ? long time !
yeah . good to see you .
what happened to that nice car of yours ?
uh , that &apos;s a ... that &apos;s a very good question .
uh , does this bus go to waikiki ?
last stop .
fantastic . all right .
here you go , buddy .
enjoy the ride , brah .
see ?
nice people .
hello .
maybe not him .
see ? this is gonna be fun , right ?
right ?
daddy , i think i &apos;m going to throw up .
don &apos;t do that . huh ?
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
you &apos;re right .
this is gonna be so much fun .
here &apos;s what we know so far .
our survivor in the icu is edward torres .
interpol missing persons has
a yellow notice out on him from 2013 .
so i ran him through the system ,
but unlike our dead guy , mr. wattana ,
torres has no record .
he &apos;s a family man .
member of his local church .
if he &apos;s such a boy scout ,
what &apos;s he doing hanging out with a death row felon like wattana ?
i don &apos;t know .
we reached out to his family ,
let them know that he &apos;s been found .
maybe they can fill in some of the blanks
until he &apos;s well enough to talk to us .
i just hung up with the coast guard .
they have nothing .
no distress calls ,
no shipwrecks within the last 72 hours .
okay , so where did these guys come from ?
well , let &apos;s break this down . we know they had a gun .
we know somebody fired at least once at them .
we know they went overboard .
maybe pirates hit the ship .
maybe @-@ maybe it was a drug deal gone bad .
we know wattana had narcotics charges against him , right ?
yeah , about that :
i also spoke with the consulate .
the thai government is sticking with their story .
according to them ,
wattana was executed at bang kwang prison in 2009
and they ain &apos;t helping us with this .
well !
hold the front page .
重要情报
we got a jerry alert .
did you see the article on hoaxposed
about the philae lander ?
billions of dollars to land on a comet ?
i don &apos;t think so .
what was it , then ?
an alien artifact .
that makes so much more sense .
right ?
aloha .
say good @-@ bye , jerry .
gotta go .
later . bye .
bye .
sorry . she just called . i just was ...
it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m actually glad to see
your little romance is , uh , taking off .
oh , you know , we &apos;re just keeping it casual .
uh , anyway , that floatation device
that those men were found clinging to ...
the boys in the lab were able to clean it up
and pull a serial number ,
which i ran through various maritime databases ,
and it belongs to this ship .
the sea falcon .
when was that taken , jerry ?
1963 .
and here &apos;s where it gets a little bit stephen king .
this was taken in 2005 , at the dry dock in bangkok
where the sea falcon was decommissioned .
wait a second .
you &apos;re telling me
that this thing has been in the boat graveyard
for the last ten years ?
ship @-@ breaking , as it &apos;s referred to ,
actually happens at a scrap yard .
but yes , i &apos;m saying this boat &apos;s
been out of commission for ten years .
so we got a ship that doesn &apos;t exist
and a vic that &apos;s been dead for six years .
kind of makes sense , though , doesn &apos;t it ?
ghost crew , ghost ship ...
let me break this to you :
ghosts and ghost ships do not exist .
i have to respectfully disagree .
the marieceleste , the flying dutchman ,
the s.s. valencia ,
the baychimo , the octavius ...
i could go on .
please don &apos;t .
sure .
i &apos;ve been a waikiki beach boy all my life ,
but when the waves are flat in the winter ,
i drive this baby .
i get to see the island , meet new people .
i love this bus life , brah .
she may be old ,
but she runs like a swiss watch .
and no one keeps their ride cleaner than me .
i gotta tell you , this is without question
the cleanest bus i have ever been on in my life .
what are you doing ? stop that .
stop that . what are you , nuts ?
see , i go at it even after
the clean @-@ up crew have done their work .
not everyone has the same standard , you know .
listen , uh , i am all for a tidy vehicle ...
which is very hard to keep
when you gotta share your car with a neanderthal , you know ?
come on ! get in !
there &apos;s daddy &apos;s car .
all right . mamo , follow that car .
someone could be hurt back there .
no , they got people there that can help .
you got a cell phone i could borrow ?
sure ...
thank you .
but we &apos;re in a black hole . no service .
gas station &apos;s got a land line .
we could go there , call it in .
no , no , no . look , we need to stick with this car
until i can get in touch with hpd , all right ?
all right , brah . all right .
excuse me , everybody .
if i could have your attention , please .
uh , my name is detective danny williams .
i &apos;m with five @-@ 0 .
i &apos;m very sorry to interrupt your trip ,
but i need to take this bus
and follow that car that we just saw flee the gas station .
so if everybody in the front could , please ,
move to the back , please .
thank you .
just have a seat and try to relax .
all right . thank you .
your phones . everybody , please , take out your cell phones .
let me know if anyone has service .
don &apos;t look at me like that .
you know , jerry might be onto something
with his ghost theory .
i mean , everyone in the service
knows about the u.s.s. hornet .
the what @-@ what ?
it was an aircraft carrier
that helped sink the yamato in 1945 .
but in her 27 years of active service ,
over 300 people lost their lives aboard that ship .
some people now claim it
to be the most haunted place in america .
in fact , some people even claim
to have actually seen the dress white ghost .
well , what &apos;s the &quot; dress white ghost &quot; ?
oh , it &apos;s this sailor in his dress white uniform .
he just roams the corridors
as if carrying out orders from another time .
for real ?
gotcha .
all right , so i got the toxicology report back from the lab .
both men had extremely high levels
of mercury in their systems .
their vitamin d levels were so low
that the lab said it looked like
they hadn &apos;t seen the sun in years .
and both sets of lungs also had evidence
of poisoning from diesel fumes .
so i &apos;m thinking , whatever boat they were on ,
they were on it for a very long time .
they were below deck or working at night .
right ? that would explain the vitamin d deficiency .
it would also explain why they were breathing diesel fumes
from the ship &apos;s engine room .
and if the only thing you &apos;re eating ,
day in , day out , is fish ,
yeah , you could definitely get mercury poisoning .
so these guys were fishermen .
yeah , but the kind of working conditions they were in ...
what kind of a fishing vessel were they on ?
the kind of vessel that doesn &apos;t care
about the people working on it .
i don &apos;t think they were fishermen .
i think they were slaves .
for three years , we were on that ship .
lights out ! no more !
you make nets , then you eat !
not once did i see land , or daylight .
his name was somchai wattana .
that was the first ,
not the last time , that he would save me .
we worked from sundown to sunup , seven days a week .
if we weren &apos;t fishing ,
we were repairing nets .
there wasn &apos;t much else to do
on our floating prison .
the work kept our minds occupied .
it was the only way to keep from going insane .
but if you stopped ,
you were punished .
khun tun !
some days , we were beaten
just to remind us that we were their property .
when i slept ,
i dreamed of my wife , tala ,
and the child she was carrying .
i dreamed i would see her again .
see the face of my son or daughter for the first time .
somchai and i kept each other strong
by trying to think of ways to escape .
how did you escape ?
when our freezers were full of fish ,
the ship would anchor offshore
and another boat would sail out to collect the haul ,
to sell in the local market .
do you think you could i.d. that boat ?
no .
our captain always kept us locked
in the cage below deck during the handover .
we knew , at these moments ,
we would never be closer to land .
making it to shore seemed like a million @-@ to @-@ one shot .
but one day , it seemed like the only choice .
for three days and nights ...
... we swam ...
and slept ...
and swam ...
and on the third day ,
i looked up and i saw it there ,
like a beautiful promise on the horizon .
i tried to wake my friend ...
... but he was gone .
at that moment , i had never felt so alone .
my arms and legs were burning with tiredness .
i felt how easy it would be to let go ...
... and slip beneath the waves .
and then i remembered the promise i made
to my friend somchai .
not to let him become a ghost of the ocean .
it takes a lot to survive an ordeal like that .
you make that ?
for my child .
it &apos;s beautiful .
we contacted your family .
they &apos;re on their way out here to see you .
thank you .
edward , do you know ,
um , how many other men were held on that ship ?
there were 14 others .
all right , so this captain decha ,
okay , if he &apos;s got any sense at all ,
he &apos;s out of here , right ?
two of his men go overboard .
he &apos;s got to assume , however unlikely ,
it &apos;s possible they made it to shore
and alerted the authorities about this operation , right ?
he &apos;s not gonna stick around and get caught .
right , but if that &apos;s the case ,
his ship could be anywhere .
nuh @-@ uh .
his connect is on o &apos;ahu .
somebody here &apos;s buying that fish .
and they got to have ship @-@ to @-@ shore comms ,
so they can set up the buy .
we find that somebody ,
maybe we can find captain decha and free those slaves .
listen , i got nothing to do with no suspect merch .
i got a brand to protect .
quality produce .
ethically sourced from local wild shrimp .
would you relax , big fella ?
nobody &apos;s even suggesting
that you &apos;re working with these people .
we just figured you might know a little something
about who is selling this cheap fish .
that &apos;s right , look--
our best shot of getting these guys off of this boat
is to locate the buyer here on the island .
all right ?
there &apos;s a mano down at maunakea marketplace--
pika-- he always comes under market price
for his fish .
well , you think he &apos;s
getting his merchandise off of these slave ships ?
i can &apos;t tell for sure .
but if you &apos;re always coming in cheaper than everybody else ,
you &apos;re saving your money somewhere .
i don &apos;t get it .
why aren &apos;t those lolos going faster ?
they think they got away .
they &apos;re driving casual so they don &apos;t attract attention .
you do the same thing .
stay close , but not too close , all right ?
you got it .
all right , how we doing on phones-- anybody , service ?
no ?
yes ?
i want to get off .
i understand .
i have things i have to do .
i know . listen :
i just gotta get in touch with hpd ,
and once i do , we can get off this bus .
can you remain calm
for just a little bit longer ?
mamo , stop ! stop ! stop !
you said follow that car .
yeah , i also said drive casual .
you ever seen a bus drive on a dirt road ?
you think they noticed ?
i &apos;m thinking yes .
all right , everybody , off the bus now , let &apos;s go !
let &apos;s go ! quick ! quick ! quick ! quick ! quick !
you heard the man-- everybody get off the bus !
all right , listen , i want you
to take everybody and my kids ,
and go hide in the fields , all right ?
let me borrow your cell phone .
you got it .
alright .
danno ?
i want you to listen to mamo
and do what he says . all right ?
do not take your eye off your little brother .
okay ? keiki , come . come , come , keiki .
go on , buddy . come .
thank you , mamo .
how do you drive this stupid thing ?
into the bushes , let &apos;s go !
hello ?
yo , mamo , howzit , brah ? wea u stay ?
i don &apos;t understand anything you &apos;re saying
and i have to use this phone !
me gotta say-- ma wahine a went make me one loco moco
and it went broke da mouth !
i have to go . thank you , good @-@ bye .
mcgarrett .
steve !
hello ?
steve , can you hear me ?
son of a bitch .
of course they took the phones .
how &apos;s it going ?
hey , i &apos;m , uh , detective danny williams .
i &apos;m with five @-@ 0 .
got a badge to back that up ?
no , i @-@ i don &apos;t . not on me .
do you have , do you have a cell phone that gets service here ?
people today are too obsessed with their phones .
i don &apos;t like it-- i come out here to connect with nature .
unplug . you feel me ?
yeah , i do , uh ...
how about a gun ? you got a gun ?
i do not .
you don &apos;t have a gun ?
what is that , road kill ?
what are you doing ?
you shot that thing with a bow and arrow ?
any lolo can hunt with a gun .
this takes real skill .
all right , i &apos;ll take it .
whoa , not so fast , friend .
you even know how to use this thing ?
yes , i know how to use this thing .
i went to archery camp in the catskills ;
two years in a row .
i was nine years old , but , uh ,
it &apos;s like riding a bike .
look , buddy , i &apos;m sorry to have to do this to you ,
but there are two men-- they are armed and dangerous .
okay , let &apos;s go .
&quot; let &apos;s go &quot; -- what do you mean &quot; let &apos;s go &quot; ?
this is an $ 800 bow .
you think i &apos;m letting it out of my sight ? think again .
plus , i know these woods .
you go in there ,
you &apos;ll be stumbling lost in two minutes .
my name is vance .
here &apos;s your ammo , cowboy .
all right , come on , lets go .
they went this way .
how do you know that ?
heel strikes .
abby .
chin said you caught a case . i thought i &apos;d pitch in .
i &apos;m glad .
look around .
a lot of competition here .
so you thought you had to cut corners ?
look , i &apos;m a businessman .
just trying to make the best deal i can .
i call when i want fish .
i pay the guy .
i don &apos;t ask questions .
that &apos;s how it works .
who do you buy from ?
you can tell us here or from behind bars .
his name is rand .
look , i swear ...
i @-@ i don &apos;t know where he gets the goods from .
i deal with him .
and that &apos;s it .
okay , where do we find him ?
how &apos;s it going ?
i think we &apos;re making some real progress .
oh , good .
hit it .
aye @-@ aye , captain .
you can &apos;t do this !
it &apos;s illegal , man !
can you believe this ?
this bird is actually complaining about his rights .
you know , coming from a man
who profits from slavery ,
that &apos;s a little rich .
i say we rinse him again .
no ! no ! no ! okay !
i &apos;ll tell you what you want to know .
that a boy , nemo .
nah , you can keep your guns .
nothing beats seeing your reflection
in the blacks of an animal &apos;s eye .
holding your nerve .
letting it get close enough to make the shot .
they came this way .
this grass has been crushed underfoot recently .
those guys who sit 200 yards away with their rifles
and their 9x scopes , they &apos;re not real hunters .
okay , look , listen to me .
you don &apos;t understand that this would all be fantastic
if we were hunting a deer , but we &apos;re not .
we &apos;re going after men that have a semiautomatic pistol .
heel strike .
see ?
no .
this way .
that &apos;s got to be them .
holed up in that house .
you got a plan , right ?
not really . no .
okay , we &apos;re good .
you &apos;re up .
look , decha &apos;s real jumpy right now
since two of his crew went overboard .
i bet . so why don &apos;t you be very convincing
and make him feel safe coming back to oahu waters , all right ?
decha , how &apos;s it going ?
rand ... i don &apos;t got time to chat .
what do you want ?
another load .
you had a pretty big haul the other day , boss .
what can i say ? demand is high right now .
so let &apos;s strike while the iron &apos;s hot .
it &apos;s what this is all about , right ?
look , you want to make money or not ?
it &apos;s risky .
don &apos;t know if the juice is worth the squeeze .
you don &apos;t have to worry about those men you lost .
news said they washed up dead yesterday .
so what do you say , partner ?
you down for making more green or what ?
keep the money .
use it to get me three new guys .
tell clark i want healthy , strong workers .
not the crap you sent me last time .
will do .
we got him .
see you soon .
so ... you know our friend graham clark .
looks like we &apos;ve got an even bigger fish on the line .
we look forward to seeing clark again .
he got away last time .
slave owners and human traffickers .
you got some choice in friends .
sit down .
we &apos;re not done with you yet .
yo , get over here and help me find the keys .
i got &apos; em .
hope they filled the tank too .
i thought you said you could use that thing .
okay , so it &apos;s not like riding a bike .
listen to me .
i want you to go try to get in the house ,
find a phone and call for help . can you do that ?
what are you gonna do ?
try to shoot them before they shoot us .
wait .
all right , go , go , go , go .
stop ! don &apos;t move .
well , this is a situation .
put down the gun .
or what ?
you gonna shoot me in the leg , too ?
from what i seen , your aim ain &apos;t too tasty .
finally , a decent shot .
first time , i aimed for his head and i got him in the leg .
second time , i went for the , uh , the leg ...
found a landline inside ,
called the cavalry .
oh , good .
hang in there , cowboy .
graham clark ! hands up !
you &apos;re under arrest for human trafficking
and violation of the mann act .
damn .
i thought you boys were gonna run .
where are the new ones ?
in the hole .
expecting someone else ?
police . step back .
it &apos;s over , okay ?
it &apos;s over ... okay ?
all right , let &apos;s go .
feel like i need a tan .
a tan ?
i look a little pasty .
well , why don &apos;t you get some sun ?
it &apos;s daddy !
you have , like , an east coast glow .
you live in hawaii , you know that ?
danno !
you &apos;re hurt ?
no , i &apos;m not hurt .
do i look hurt ?
i &apos;m just getting sympathy from you . go , sit down .
buddy , thank you very much for taking care of my kids
and looking out for everybody on that bus .
did a good job .
not just a hero on the board , huh ?
anybody could have done the same thing .
hey , how &apos;s my bus ?
uh , it needs a little tlc , but it &apos;s fine .
just a little ... ish .
heard you been fraternizing with the competition .
what &apos;s he talking about ? the huli huli chicken ?
la , la @-@ la @-@ la @-@ la @-@ la !
don &apos;t say that name around here .
i apologize .
i didn &apos;t , i didn &apos;t mean to upset you .
i &apos;m not upset .
my feelings are just hurt .
okay , i don &apos;t defend danny unless i absolutely have to ,
but , big guy , chicken ? really ?
chicken &apos;s not competition for shrimp .
surf and turf are very , very different things .
it was an either @-@ or sort of thing .
it &apos;s not the chicken , it &apos;s the disloyalty .
that i understand .
and , anyway , i &apos;m gonna be big on this .
i &apos;m gonna let your indiscretion pass this one time .
you &apos;re a very generous man .
i &apos;m a fool to myself .
just out of curiosity .
i mean , you know i don &apos;t ever want to taste the stuff myself .
was it as good as people say ?
you got nothing to worry about .
you guys all suck at lying .
this is your father .
i made this for you .
so , listen ...
i was thinking ...
uh , me too .
uh , you first .
you asked me what i was gonna do next .
am i gonna like where this is going ?
depends if you &apos;d be happy
if i stuck around for a little while longer .
&quot; little while longer . &quot;
uh , look , i realize things got off to a really bad start here .
in some ways .
in other ways , things were really great .
you know what i mean .
look , anyway ...
i totally understand if you feel like i &apos;ve ruined
whatever chance we have of making it work
because of my assignment ,
but , look , i really like it here ,
and a big part of that ,
the biggest part of that ,
is you .
