no sex for at least a month . bree made a decision ...
focus on getting me a divorce . and hired angie .
let &apos;s get cookin &apos; . gaby struggled at home .
what is going on ?
it &apos;s called homeschooling !
lynette &apos;s body was changing .
i have to hide these things at work
so carlos doesn &apos;t find out i &apos;m pregnant .
the cops wanted to know where you were
the night that julie mayer was strangled .
you know i never attacked her .
angie knew about the affair .
is it true you shot katherine mayfair ?
and susan got in trouble .
if someone wanted proof
that judge mary gallagher had a sense of humor ,
all they needed to do was watch her pronounce sentence .
for the slum lord who refused to fix a furnace ...
you have to live in your own tenement for a month ...
starting in december .
the woman who threw a phone at her maid ...
you will clean mrs. garcia &apos;s home for the next six weeks .
and , yes , you will do windows .
for the high school coach
who made lewd remarks to a cheerleader ...
at the next school assembly ,
you will perform a cheer ... in uniform .
and i &apos;d shave those legs if i were you .
and then there was
the case of the housewife who shot her neighbor ...
so she just popped up in my window ,
and i fired . it was an accident .
liar ! it was no accident !
she wanted me dead .
i did not . at least , not then .
as you can see , your honor ,
this is an unfortunate situation .
it &apos;s a mess is what it is .
i assume there &apos;s some history here .
she once dated my husband .
she stole him from me .
stole ? he came screaming back
like he was running from a fire .
enough .
i take it you &apos;re the man in question .
yes , your honor .
i could see shooting someone over you .
thank you ?
okay , i &apos;m gonna rule now .
my inclination is to avoid giving out jail time in this case .
i object !
overruled !
however ... a firearm was discharged ,
and there are consequences for that .
your honor , before you hand down your ruling ,
may i say something ?
make it quick . i already find you uninteresting .
not only did susan shoot me at point @-@ blank range ,
she trashed me to all of my friends and neighbors ,
telling them i was some kind of crazy , stalking nut !
that true ?
have you been trashing her ?
i ... never said &quot; nut . &quot;
i ... said &quot; loon . &quot;
mrs. delfino ...
okay , i trashed her a little .
but what i said was true ,
and that &apos;s free speech .
you can &apos;t punish me for that .
yes , when it came to sentencing ,
judge mary gallagher had a sense of humor .
but not everyone
found her funny .
there is a coffee shop in fairview .
it &apos;s known as a place where you
can read your morning paper ...
where you can meet your friends ...
where you can bump into your neighbors ...
whether you want to or not .
hi .
boy , i hope they have decaf today .
last time i was here , they were
out , so i had to have regular
and got so wired , i didn &apos;t sleep all night .
does that happen to you ?
seriously ? you think i &apos;m gonna make small talk with you ?
excuse me ?
i know you slept with my husband .
so ... i &apos;m thinkin &apos; we &apos;re past the chit @-@ chat stage .
i am so sorry .
let me tell you how shame works .
when you see the wife of the guy you banged ,
you don &apos;t make conversation .
you don &apos;t even smile and say hi .
you avert your gaze and you blush .
nod if you understand .
here &apos;s your mocha latte . that &apos;ll be $ 3.50 .
oh . it &apos;s on her . she owes me .
hey . you &apos;re gonna be late for class .
dad ?
all my clothes are too tight . i had to borrow yours .
i was gonna wear that shirt today .
well , when you &apos;re hiding
your fourth month of pregnancy with twins ,
you can have it back . what do you think ?
i &apos;m still attracted to you
in men &apos;s clothes . is that weird ?
all i need is to pull this off for two more days .
you should &apos;ve told carlos two months ago .
there &apos;s no way he won &apos;t be furious when he finds out .
tom , i may be wearing men &apos;s clothes ,
but i am not an idiot . i &apos;ve got this .
terrence henderson and i are about to close
the biggest deal in the history of this company .
once carlos sees how great terrence is ,
he &apos;ll see the work can still get done
even when i &apos;m on maternity leave .
and you &apos;re sure this deal is gonna close ?
nope .
that &apos;s why we need to keep our fingers crossed .
okay , now wish me luck .
good luck .
now come here , mister . i wanna kiss ya .
okay , now it &apos;s weird .
bless me , father , for i have sinned .
go ahead , my child .
well , i &apos;ve been homeschooling my daughter ,
and it &apos;s been a living hell ,
so i tried to bribe someone
to get her into catholic school .
what happened ?
well , you tell me .
gabrielle , what are you doing ?
oh , come on , padre . you &apos;re the head of admissions .
and you &apos;ve got a great school here ,
but there &apos;s a 2 @-@ year waiting list !
put your money away .
it &apos;s your money . sleep with it
for a while . see how it feels .
no !
i wish i could help , but my hands are tied .
oh , come on . i &apos;m not asking you to part the red sea .
just find a spot for one kid in the second grade .
look , if a student were to withdraw ,
i might be able to move you to the top of the waiting list .
fantastic ! but frankly ,
we tend to favor those who are more faithful .
what does that mean ?
well , i &apos;ve noticed that you don &apos;t come to mass very often .
oh ! i hear ya , padre .
you &apos;re okay with money as long as it comes
comes in one of those little
wicker baskets you pass around .
no , that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying .
of course not .
i realize it &apos;s dark in here , but just know i &apos;m winking back .
so your first opera ...
that &apos;s quite a milestone .
throw in &quot; last , &quot; and it &apos;s two milestones .
oh , stop . i saw you tear up at the end of act two .
only because i realized there was an act three .
&quot; madame butterfly &quot; is puccini &apos;s masterpiece .
didn &apos;t you enjoy it just a little ?
what about that scene when butterfly tells her child
not to feel sorrow for her mother &apos;s desertion ?
didn &apos;t that make you feel anything ?
actually , that &apos;s when you leaned forward ,
and i saw a little peek of your boob .
so i guess it made me feel horny .
karl , don &apos;t .
come on . it &apos;s a dark parking structure .
people are just gonna think i &apos;m mugging you .
we agreed no sex for a month .
we need to find out if we can be
together in a nonsexual manner .
i &apos;m serious .
can you keep your hands to yourself ?
can i ?
thanks to you , it &apos;s my only choice .
hey , how was your business dinner ?
oh . um ... our bid was , uh , too high .
it looks like they &apos;re gonna go with another caterer .
what are you listening to ?
it &apos;s a new recording of &quot; madame butterfly . &quot;
isn &apos;t that glorious ?
it is . i should ... go to bed , orson .
good night .
all right , guys .
you sign the lease , and we &apos;ll pop the champagne .
the florida branch is officially a go .
terrific . so when we get our branch manager ?
we have got somebody great lined up .
we just need to finalize some things .
we &apos;ll get back to ya . thanks . who do we have lined up ?
nobody . that &apos;s the thing we need to finalize .
but today , we celebrate .
lynette , you really hit this one out of the park .
i gotta give credit where credit is due .
terrence did a lot of the heavy lifting on this one ,
and i don &apos;t care if i embarrass him . this guy is a star .
strangely , i &apos;m not embarrassed .
carlos ,
i didn &apos;t want to interrupt your phone call ,
but your wife is here . uh , just tell her
to wait in my office until we &apos;re finished .
you listen to me , carlos solis !
i just came from st. ursula &apos;s , and we &apos;ve got big trouble !
do not blow me off !
so according to the catholic church ,
we &apos;re not holy enough .
but i have a feeling a big , fat check
might slap on a halo . how big ?
well , something that &apos;ll make a priest say
&quot; holy &quot; and &quot; mother &quot; in the same sentence .
that should get her to the top of the waiting
listen . i &apos;m not going to write a big check
on the chance that it might get her in .
carlos !
gaby , i can &apos;t do this now .
you know the problems that i &apos;m facing
trying to get the new florida office up and running .
now if you don &apos;t mind ...
fine . can i trouble you for $ 5 ?
i &apos;ll buy juanita a hairnet
and prepare her for a future in the fast food industry .
hello ... gentlemen .
what ? a lot of people are wearing this style .
well , doesn &apos;t make it right .
hey , uh , gaby , i heard you mention st. ursula &apos;s .
it is worth the hassle .
our daughter molly &apos;s in the second grade .
she loves it there .
oh , i didn &apos;t know molly was in the same grade as juanita .
yeah . would you excuse me for a second ?
hey , that branch in florida ?
i think i found our man .
no , no , no , you can &apos;t send terrence to florida .
you should take it as a compliment .
you trained him well . exactly . you can &apos;t send him away .
what if you need him here ? why would i ? i &apos;ve got you .
but ...
what if i was hit by a bus
and i was ... put on bed rest for , say , three months ?
who--who would cover for me ?
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
you jinxed it . now for sure some
version of that is gonna happen .
lynette , it &apos;s done . we are sending terrence to florida .
oh , and i really like this new look that you &apos;ve got going ,
but careful-- roberta in accounting asked
if i thought you &apos;d like to go bowling with her .
hi , susan !
oh , god . ugh .
what are you doing here ?
i was just having lunch
with some friends who are not on a chain gang .
thought i &apos;d stop by and say hi .
you mean stop by and gloat .
maybe a little .
so ... how &apos;s it going ?
meeting anybody ?
they say the friends you make on the inside ...
you &apos;ll have for life .
yes , katherine , this all sucks .
but you know what ?
at the end of the day , i go home to mike ...
which means i won .
that &apos;s big talk for a woman
standing in an orange jumpsuit
with blisters on her feet .
well , mike will rub them when i go home .
and for the record , i totally make this work .
the fact that you think you look good in orange
showi &apos;m not dealing with a rational person .
oh , by the way ... you missed something .
no , i didn &apos;t . yeah , you did .
bye @-@ bye .
hey ! come back here !
she littered ! shoot her !
what a moron .
i wish i &apos;d caught her license plate number .
she &apos;d be sorry .
really ?
what kind of damage could you do with her home address ?
you missed something .
did you get &apos; em all ?
you &apos;re supposed to eat it , not wear it .
well , they call it crumb cake for a reason . come on .
emily , can you steam me some 2 % milk ?
this is what happens when i &apos;m five minutes late ?
what ?
the waitress with the hands .
she was brushing crumbs off my shirt .
what , the ones julie missed ?
oh , god .
is this how it &apos;s gonna be every time i talk to a woman ?
yeah , probably .
angie , i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know how many times i can say it .
i &apos;ll do anything you want . i &apos;ll do couples therapy .
great idea .
let &apos;s tell somebody all our secrets ,
and then when we &apos;re cured , we can kill him .
look , i don &apos;t know what you want .
i want you to be the guy you used to be ,
the guy who saved my life , not the guy who destroyed it .
how we doing here ?
never been better ,
come on in ! yeah !
this is so nice of you .
yeah . oh , no .
it &apos;s not every day that one of my associates
gets a big promotion .
thank you .
tom , why don &apos;t you take crystal
in the den and get comfortable
while i steal this guy to help me make cocktails ?
come on . right this way .
so how excited are you ? miami !
pretty jazzed . it &apos;s an exciting opportunity .
i think it &apos;s great how you &apos;re concentrating
on the upside of this .
there &apos;s a downside ?
no , not really . forget i mentioned it .
it &apos;s just ...
do you remember tim baker who was sent to
head up our chicago office ?
never heard of him .
exactly .
so ... you are moving to florida .
wow ! pecan ?
oh , no , thanks . i &apos;m on a diet . oh .
aw , yeah , i can &apos;t wait . no more winter .
yep , just heat and hurricanes .
oh , i &apos;m willing to put up with that .
miami has so many other things to offer .
oh , it certainly must to attract all
those colombian drug lords .
the chicago branch was a little slow out of the gate .
corporate freaked and made tim the scapegoat .
where is he now ?
he &apos;s in plastics ... or paper ,
depending on what you want your groceries in . wine ?
and when they cut into the alligator &apos;s stomach ,
not only was the guy &apos;s arm still intact ,
but it was still holding his golf club .
i think he would &apos;ve been fine if his wife hadn &apos;t left him .
that led directly to the alcoholism , which probably
had something to do with him threatening the president .
boy , is that a bitch on the old resume .
that humidity ... your hair ?
i think it &apos;s a recipe for cotton candy .
here we go , everybody . we &apos;ve got the wine .
i would like to propose a toast .
to terrence and crystal ,
may miami be everything you think it will .
you &apos;re here .
knock knock . anybody home ?
come on in , angie .
this is pretty . what is it ?
it &apos;s from the opera &quot; madame butterfly . &quot;
she sounds so sad .
well , actually , in this aria , butterfly is hopeful
that one day her lover will return to her .
oh . does he ?
no .
because of his abandonment , she kills herself .
you ever see &quot; avenue q &quot; ? the musical with the puppets ?
now that &apos;s good theater .
bree &apos;s not here . what do you want ?
well , i need to talk to her about some work stuff .
where is she ?
she &apos;s out .
that &apos;s generally where bree is these days . out .
she &apos;s meeting with a prospective client ,
so she says .
she &apos;s had four client meetings this week ,
and not one has resulted in a booking .
why do you think that is ?
it &apos;s a rough economy .
see , i think she &apos;s taken a lover .
what ? oh , come on . no way .
how can you be so sure ?
an affair ?
oh , please , the woman makes her own croutons .
perhaps .
angie , i have to go away on a golf weekend .
while i &apos;m gone ,
could you do me a favor and keep an eye on bree ?
what do you mean ?
just observe her .
does she come home at night ? is anyone with her ?
look , if you wanna be paranoid ,
go ahead . it &apos;s a free country .
but i am not gonna spy on your wife for you .
i suppose that &apos;s for the best .
i mean , if i did find out she was betraying me ,
i &apos;d probably do something stupid .
oh , toughen up . it &apos;s just a little dust .
look , i have to clean that area .
would you mind having your breakdown someplace else ?
just leave me alone , okay ?
you won , i lost . isn &apos;t that enough ?
what ?
when you &apos;re sitting on the side of the road picking up
styrofoam and wads of gum , it &apos;s time to admit defeat .
the man i love chose you .
are you messing with me ?
no . i &apos;m being honest .
why has this been so hard on me ?
well ... you loved him .
i did .
i really did . and now he &apos;s gone .
katherine , you &apos;re an attractive , intelligent woman .
you &apos;re gonna meet other guys .
not like mike .
we connected on so many different levels ...
intellectually , emotionally , sexually .
oh , i &apos;ve never felt such passion .
where am i gonna find another guy
who &apos;ll make love to me five times in one day ?
that &apos;s a lie .
no , it &apos;s not .
five times ?
susan , come on .
don &apos;t tell me that you and mike have never ...
maybe i didn &apos;t lose after all .
remind me to ask you what you want
for breakfast more often .
beats a bowl of oatmeal , doesn &apos;t it ?
you kidding ? that beat a waffle .
listen , i have a crazy idea .
why don &apos;t we both call in sick
and spend the day in bed naked together ?
did i mention naked ?
you wanna go for seconds ?
mm @-@ hmm .
oh , what &apos;s gotten into you ?
even on my birthday you told me to hurry up
because &quot; the bachelor &quot; was on .
well ... can &apos;t a wife just want
to spend time with her husband ?
well , yeah . it &apos;s just that your timing &apos;s bad .
gotta finish mr. hinkle &apos;s shower .
i promised him i &apos;d be there yesterday .
i &apos;m serious . the old man hasn &apos;t had a shower in three days .
and that &apos;s a long time ... mm @-@ hmm .
for an old man ...
to not take a shower .
oh , the hell with it .
he survived world war ii . he &apos;ll get through this .
father crowley , hi . this is for you .
i thought i &apos;d catch up on my giving to my favorite parish .
wow . i certainly didn &apos;t expect this .
well , do with it what you will-- buy a new pipe organ ,
help the needy ,
take a trip to tahiti . i really don &apos;t care .
oh , listen .
i don &apos;t know which nun you &apos;re gonna put my kid with ,
but make sure she &apos;s had a tetanus shot .
juanita &apos;s a biter .
uh , gabrielle ,
i think you &apos;re jumping the gun here .
why ? a spot opened up .
molly henderson is moving to florida , right ?
well , she was . her father was going to take a new job ,
but he decided against it .
what ? no ! no , this can &apos;t be !
i &apos;m afraid it is .
anyway , h @-@ how did you even know about this ?
we &apos;ll talk about it in confession .
have faith , gabrielle .
when god closes a door , he opens a window .
thank you , father crowley .
hey . i got the stuff for the mushroom tarts .
how &apos;s that cake coming along ?
just when i think i can &apos;t top myself , i do . hmm .
hmm . how about that ?
oh , by the way , orson thinks you &apos;re having an affair .
he thinks what now ?
he thinks you &apos;re steppin &apos; out .
but i told him there is no way
bree van de kamp
is whoring it up in some sleazy motel .
uh , thank you for that .
sorry to spring it on you like that .
i just felt you should know what he was saying .
well , i appreciate it .
i just don &apos;t understand why he would go to you .
well , he was drinking a lot .
also , he asked me if i would spy on you .
relax , bree .
obviously i said no .
and i appreciate that , too .
would you mind , um , cleaning this up for me ?
are you sure you &apos;re done topping yourself ?
this is serious , karl . he asked angie to spy on me .
and god knows who else he has watching me .
i don &apos;t think we should see each other again
until after you &apos;ve gotten me a divorce .
don &apos;t ask me how . you &apos;re the lawyer .
hey . aren &apos;t you supposed to be at school ?
you never come home for lunch .
i thought i &apos;d try something different .
mmm . hey , since we &apos;re both home ,
why don &apos;t we go upstairs and make love ?
what , seriously ? you want to do it again ?
i just got a sub from martinelli &apos;s .
mike , i am offering you a nooner .
drop your pants and get upstairs .
can i bring my sandwich ?
yes . bring it . grab a pickle . i don &apos;t care .
you &apos;re the best wife ever .
come on !
can i turn on &quot; the three stooges , &quot; too ?
lynette , it &apos;s gaby !
in a minute .
hey , gaby .
hey , nanook . why you wearing a parka ?
because ... fur is murder . what &apos;s up ?
i talked to crystal henderson ,
and she said you talked terrence out of going to miami .
is that true ?
i didn &apos;t talk him out of it .
i merely pointed out the pros and cons .
well , apparently , the cons won .
you &apos;ve gotta untalk him out of it .
i need him out of this state .
why ? are you sleeping with him ?
no ! truth is , if he doesn &apos;t go ,
juanita can &apos;t take his kid &apos;s spot
at st. ursula &apos;s .
you are unbelievable .
you want this guy to uproot his entire life
just so you can get out of homeschooling your daughter ?
yeah , yeah , selfish gaby .
same old song . join in if you know the words .
well , sorry , gaby , i need terrence here .
why ?
are you sleeping with him ?
no ! i just need him here .
every time i turn around ,
someone is trying to make my life more complicated .
why can &apos;t everyone just let it go ?
hey , i &apos;m sorry .
come here .
everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
why are you getting so upset ?
what was that ?
what was what ?
your stomach just kicked me .
open the parka .
i &apos;d rather not .
open it !
you &apos;re pregnant ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me ? !
because ...
i knew you &apos;d tell carlos .
yeah , so i tell carlos . what &apos;s wrong with ...
oh , no .
when carlos offered you that promotion ,
you knew you were pregnant
and you knew you &apos;d be leaving him in the lurch ?
gaby ...
carlos just got this company !
he brought in people he could depend on ,
and he thought he could depend on you !
i didn &apos;t tell carlos
because i knew i was the best person for the job ,
and i wanted to prove it .
well , you certainly proved something .
gaby , wait ! please don &apos;t tell carlos .
i think he should hear it from me .
yeah . better late than never , right ?
susan , i &apos;m home !
are you hungry ?
up here !
hello , lover .
oh , god .
susan , i can &apos;t .
i got nothing left .
i hit my hand with a wrench today ,
and when i cried , only dust came out .
you cried ?
that is so sexy .
mm . what is going on with you ?
it &apos;s like you just got out of prison .
is there a problem with a husband and wife having sex ?
we have a passionate relationship , don &apos;t we ?
well , of course we do .
it &apos;s just , i was hoping tonight we could ...
cuddle .
cuddle ?
am i that repulsive to you ?
what ?
it &apos;s okay , mike . you can say it .
i &apos;m a lousy lay .
susan , we had sex three times today .
all right , i can &apos;t do it again .
it &apos;s not you . it &apos;s basic biology .
really ? biology ?
well , here is some basic math .
you had sex with katherine five times in one day
and me three .
five minus three equals
katherine turns you on , and sex with me is a chore .
you and katherine actually talked about this ?
more like she rubbed it in my face .
okay .
look , the only reason that that &quot; record &quot; ever happened
was we got snowed in during a ski trip .
and we had absolutely nothing to talk about .
sex was all we ever had !
don &apos;t you get it ?
there was nothing else to the relationship .
but you and i ... we &apos;ve got everything .
we have a rich , full life together .
we could finish each other &apos;s sentences .
oh , mike , i ...
i &apos;ve been so foolish .
is that what you were gonna say ?
and ?
you wanna cuddle .
i was gonna say &quot; the bachelor &quot; is on .
but cuddling &apos;s good , too .
karl , what are you doing here ? someone could see you !
yeah , especially if you leave me
standing on your doorstep .
relax . i parked two blocks away .
i don &apos;t appreciate your taking risks like this .
if orson find out about ... - ah , ah , ah , ah .
you won &apos;t have that to worry about much longer .
i found a way to spring you from this marriage !
orson &apos;s still on parole , right ?
for another year . why ?
if he violates parole by , for instance ,
associating with a known felon , they can revoke it .
and send him back to jail . all we need to do
is get some ex @-@ con in a room with orson ,
take some pictures , and bam !
he can &apos;t touch you because if he does ,
the parole officer will get the pictures ,
and it &apos;s bye @-@ bye , orson .
karl , that &apos;s perfect ! and then he &apos;ll have to let me go .
ahh . i think someone deserves a kiss .
karl , we agreed .
bree , for the first time since we &apos;ve been together ,
your husband is out of town .
do we really want to let that go to waste ?
come on . come on !
do not answer that .
this is bree . please leave a message .
oh , damn it !
hello ?
bree , you gotta get that man
out of your bedroom right now !
what ? there &apos;s no man in my room .
oh , good , &apos; cause it was just about to
get a whole lot more crowded .
orson is home .
orson .
you &apos;re home early .
is something wrong ?
why are you back so soon ?
i &apos;m coming down with a cold .
you know how i hate to be sick away from home .
what are you doing ?
there are two glasses downstairs and one has wine .
you are obviously not alone here .
what are you implying ?
you know perfectly well what i &apos;m implying , bree .
who was drinking the wine ?
well , first of all ,
i am insulted that you would even think that--
bree , where are you ? oh , there you are !
orson .
wow , i pop home for five minutes
to toss some clothes in the dryer ,
and you got a man in your bedroom .
you were here tonight ?
oh , yeah . just tossin &apos; back a little vino and gossiping .
yes , this girl knows everything about everybody .
is there any wine left ? i could use a glass .
yes , downstairs on the table . you go on ahead .
we &apos;re gonna finish up our girl talk .
where are the clothes ? behind the pillow .
hey . you &apos;re gonna have to jump .
there &apos;s rose bushes , so put your pants on first .
angie , i can &apos;t thank you enough .
i didn &apos;t do this for you . i did it for orson .
for orson ?
i defended you .
i told him you had too much class to do
something like this . i understand your disdain ,
but this is a complicated situation .
let me make it simple for you--
two men want you . choose one .
but which one ?
orson &apos;s blackmailing me to stay with him .
he &apos;s manipulative and calculating and--
then go with lover boy .
but what kind of life would i have with karl ?
he &apos;s crass and conceited
and the only thing we seem to have in common
is sex .
then why are you having an affair
with someone you don &apos;t even like ? did i mention the sex ?
karl brings out passion in me
i never knew i had . i melt every time he touches me .
great ! then find a way out of your marriage
and--and start building a life with
