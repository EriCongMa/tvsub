I think we both know that she's everything that I'm not.
And nothing that I wanna be.
So really you just wanted to use me... for sex.
I thought you were different.
What do I have to do to prove it to you?
It's about Dani.
What happened?
We had sex.
... and I, we're working the program together.
I pray I can do better for this baby,
than I did for my twins.
Sorry I was being such a bitch.
I'm having a hard time right now.
No, you're allowed.
What's going on with you?
Is it Wyatt?
We're kinda taking a break.
Idyllwild would like to offer you a full ride
to their summer music program.
Yeah, I know, it's just one
of the most prestigious programs in the country.
I can't sign the papers again. I can't abandon you.
I love you.
I don't love you.
I'm never getting adopted.
You don't know that.
So, I'm not gonna graduate?
No, that is not what we're saying.
But I took World History at Jefferson.
And obviously I took Algebra,
I'm in Algebra II now.
Yes, I know, and I'm gonna
do everything I can to find those transcripts,
and get those credits, but...
So I'm gonna have to take all of these classes over again?
Hopefully not. But even if I do find all of your records,
you're still gonna need to go to summer school.
Awesome.
And we should probably come up with some kind of
independent study project for you.
We know this is unfair,
and I wish we could just, fix everything, love...
It's out of your hands. Yeah, I get it.
With a plan, we can get you through this.
Yeah, unless I have to live with the Quinns,
and I'm going to some private school
where they tell me my credits
from Anchor Beach didn't even transfer.
We're not going to let Robert,
or anyone else, take you out of this house.
CPS took me when your
your foster license expired,
and there was nothing you could do about that.
I'm sorry. I'm just...
We know. We know.
So guess who got the highest score in her grade
on the math evaluations! Ninety-eight!
That's incredible, Mariana.
Great job! You're amazing.
We're sorry, honey, that is amazing.
We are very proud of you.
That's awesome.
I guess I'll just have to wait until they announce my name
at the assembly this week to get the props I deserve.
Honey, really?
I'm kidding, it's fine.
But guess what else? You know Craig,
Craig the math teacher?
He wants me to join STEM.
Well that sounds fun.
What is it?
Uh, Science, Technology,
something, and Math.
It's like computer club, but like a team or something.
And they go to like, coding competitions and stuff.
It's kind of a big deal.
If you do say so yourself.
Well, apparently no one else is going to.
OK, when's dinner? I'm starved.
In a few minutes, go ahead and go wash up.
Ok.
Can I...?
Yeah.
We love you.
I love you, too.
God, I hate seeing her like this.
She's... looks so defeated.
Yeah, well, can you blame her?
It's just been one thing after another for her.
No, I know, but
we have got to help her graduate.
Graduating from high school is the
single most important thing that a foster kid can do.
A foster kid? That's what we're calling her now?
Well,
until the court decides otherwise, it's what she is.
Hello?
What?
OK, slow down.
Stef, Stef...
I need your help.
You don't wanna hurt anyone!
We don't have...
Where the hell is it?!
Come on, man, before you hurt someone.
Police! Drop it, drop the knife!
Drop the knife! Drop the knife! Get on the ground!
On the ground!
OK, OK.
Both of you, on the ground now!
On the ground!
We live here!
You two, down,
There are kids here!
Both of you, on the ground, now!
Where are they?
Where are the kids?
I...
Where are they?!
The bedroom.
Face down, on the ground.
Is anybody in there?
Hands behind your back. I said hands behind your back.
Hello.
Um... listen, the police are here, and you're safe, you're fine.
Can you, uh, can you open the door?
Hi, honey.
I'm with the police, you see my badge right there?
Can you open up the door?
Yeah?
He was talking all kinds of crazy,
saying they stole his stash,
and next thing you know, he pulls a knife.
So I grabbed the girls, locked us in the bedroom, and called you.
Why didn't your foster parents call the police?
I don't know. He's their friend or somethin'.
The sketchy guy?
Damn. I mean,
I've been in some bad foster homes before, but
never anything like that.
Well, at least you're safe now.
Yeah, tonight,
who knows where they gonna put me next.
What about you?
What's going on with you?
well, Robert's trying to get custody.
For real?
Yeah, I have to have visitations with him
every week.
It's not the same as you, like, at all,
but I keep thinking, like maybe,
maybe now, maybe this time,
I'll be out of the system for good, you know?
And they just keep...
pulling me back.
I just wanna be in one place for a while, you know?
Even if it ain't as nice as this one.
I hope...
I hope you get that.
Stoned much?
Planning to go to class?
So you trying to get kicked out of school?
What the hell do you care?
Please don't tell me you're not acting like this
because we broke up.
Yeah, Callie,
you're the reason for every single thing that I do.
OK, I don't even wipe the sleep outta my eyes in the morning
without wondering what you're going think about it.
Peace.
Well?
Not the best falafel in San Diego.
What? You cannot be serious.
A close second.
To mine.
Well, I will be the judge of that.
Next time, you're bringing lunch.
Mmm, OK.
We need to do this more often. It's been too long.
I know.
I've been meaning to check in with you,
but um...
... after you lost the baby, I...
I just didn't know what to say.
It's OK.
I get it.
And how about you?
Are you, OK?
I am, mostly.
Work's a good distraction.
So what do you think about, Monty? So far.
Well,
I had my reservations, as you know,
but she's pretty great.
She's leaving the academics to me,
and she has some amazing fund-raising ideas.
I think
for the first time in a very long time,
we're in good hands.
Wow. Sounds like she's really won you over.
I wouldn't go that far.
Look, look, I'm sorry, all right?
Whatever.
I don't get it, Jesus.
You say you like me,
you say you care about me, and then you just blow me off.
I really wanted you to see me at the dance competition.
No, I just...
remember, you said we have to be there for people.
I was talking about me. Your girlfriend.
I know, but Ana...
Your birth mom?
What about her?
She's pregnant, OK?
The crack-head?
She's not a crack-head.
Not anymore.
How'd you find out?
I went to one of her AA meetings.
She was telling everyone.
I got so weirded out. I left before she saw me.
What'd Mariana say?
She doesn't know, and you can't tell her.
She'll freak out, she'll tell my moms.
And then I'm screwed. OK?
Ok.
I'm still bummed you missed my solo.
You're gonna have to make it up to me.
Promise.
So, who's the baby daddy?
What if it's, Mike?
Who's Mike?
OK, so there are two generals,
with armies, on either side of a city.
Now both armies have to attack at the same time,
otherwise the lone attacker is defeated.
So, they just have to agree...
Mind if I...
No.
But, what're you doing here?
I was invited.
... if a message has been delivered.
How do you create a formula
to be 100 percent sure
that the armies attack at the same time?
Uh, you can't.
Well, there's always be some uncertainty.
It's a trick question, right?
That's right.
Now, I'm gonna walk the rest of you...
Never woulda thought Jesus' sister
would turn out to be a math whiz.
Was that even a math question?
And please tell me you know I'm nothing like my brother.
No, I do.
Look...I'm sorry about how
all that went down.
With Hayley and everything.
It's cool.
Don't worry about it.
If it helps, I like you way better than her.
That does help.
A little.
But I don't think Hayley was even the problem.
I think we were done as soon as
I became his math tutor.
He just couldn't deal with me being smarter than him.
But I'm glad that you're here.
Between this and wrestling, I was starting to think
that I was the only person in the world without a penis.
And it's not gonna be some kind of crazy, drug-fueled,
trashing hotels kinda tour.
We're just going to be playing like skate parks,
small clubs maybe a fair if we can book one.
And we'll crash with friends,
or sleep in the van if we have to.
Or, you know, we'll set aside enough money to make sure we're staying in motels.
You know, nice ones. Clean ones. Like chains.
And I'll do SAT prep online
and I'll make sure I'm working on my summer reading list in the van.
I mean, most of the our time will be spent driving anyways, so...
Not on freeways or anything like that.
Or night, just...
Look, it's gonna be really cool.
And it's a chance to see a little bit of the world
while I do something I love.
Well, you've given us a lot to think about,
just give us some time.
Ok.
All right.
But, you know, as you're deliberating,
I just want you to think of this as less of a tour
and more of like a right of passage.
OK.
That's good. That's enough. Thank you.
All right.
Well, that was good for a laugh.
I just mean, come on,
we're not gonna let him go on the road. Right?
It's the summer before his senior year.
Colleges are gonna wanna see
an internships and study programs,
and not from the, Sid Vicious School of Rock'n'Roll.
Sid Vicious?
You forget, I used to be cool.
All right, so you guys wanna tell him,
or you want me to take the heat this time?
Well, I mean let's hold on here for a second,
I think maybe he should go.
You, what?
Who are you and what have you done with my wife?
What's he doing here?
Good to see you, too, Jesus.
Jesus.
Sorry, that came out wrong.
Would you like to back up and try that again?
Hey, Mike, how's it going?
Good, bud, how's wrestling?
Good.
Chatty.
Teenage.
They reach a verdict?
Still deliberating.
Two against one. One being in favor.
Wow, poor Lena.
Having to fend for herself against two cops.
Actually, it's Mom.
No way, Stef's pro tour?
It's weird, right? It's like Freaky Friday down there.
Yeah.
You didn't tell them about Idyllwild, did you?
No.
Yeah, if they find out about that,
there's no way they're letting you go on tour.
Don't worry, I'm not gonna say anything.
Sweetheart.
Can we talk to you for a moment?
About Ana.
Why?
Well, mom told me how hard it was for you,
when Ana made her amends.
I just, don't like seeing girls cry.
It's not just about that.
You have a connection with her.
And that's OK.
What's not OK is ignoring the fact
that you are a child of an addict.
So if you decide you want to see Ana again,
we'd like you to be prepared.
We want you to start going to Alateen meetings.
What is that? Like, AA for teens?
No, no, no, it's for teenagers
whose parents or family members,
are alcoholics or addicts.
It's just a
way to help you guys figure out how to deal with it all.
Do I have to?
I don't even know if I want to see Ana again.
You say that now.
But in a few weeks, or months,
who knows how you're gonna feel?
Hey, Mom.
Hey, B, good timing. Come here, love. Come here.
Um, you have been to a few Alateen meetings, haven't you?
Yeah, sure.
Um... yeah, it's super cool. You should totally go.
See, you wouldn't be in this alone,
Brandon'll take you.
What?
Why do I have to go?
Because it would be really good for both of you.
So they're selling kids now, is that it?
That's not how I'd describe it.
Then how do you explain putting kids in an apartment
where the adults that are responsible for them
are letting meth addicts in the front door?
Stef...
Well, what?
It's money, isn't it?
I mean, this is exactly why you cannot
privatize things like foster care.
Foster care is not privatized.
OK, then what would you call it?
The county contracts with
some private agencies to place more kids.
There just aren't enough homes.
And those agencies get paid more based on the number
of homes they find and kids they place. Correct?
So they're incentivized
to approve people who may or may not be qualified.
Well, unfortunately, that's really not for us to decide.
Are you not part of Child Protective Services?
Who else is gonna decide these things, exactly?
I can't... he won't answer. I don't understand.
As long as Kiara doesn't have to go back into that house.
You are not sending her back there. Are you?
I know people in Vegas. I'll just go there and lay low.
"Lay low" with who? Other runaways?
You know that's not gonna work.
I don't care, I'm not going back to that place!
You're just gonna end up back in juvie.
OK, look, you don't see me running.
Don't you get it?
My foster parents know I narc'd on them.
You think they're going to welcome be back with open arms?
So... I was looking over our API scores.
And can we talk about Mariana?
Top in her class in Math? How about that!
I know, pretty great, right?
We're so proud of her.
Well, the whole school did well in Math, in fact,
it's very impressive.
Thank you.
English on the other hand,
not so much.
The scores are... low, and if
we wanna qualify for the kind of grants we need,
well, we gotta get 'em up.
In a fiscal crisis like we're in, it's a big issue.
I hear you.
We need to get on top of this right away.
We've gotta make some changes to our curriculum,
as soon as possible,
so are you up for speaking with Timothy?
I mean since he's the head of the English Department?
Well?
Well, what?
Well? How was it?
I want to make sure it's good before I show it to Tia.
Oh, it's good.
It is?
Oh yeah.
It's sexy.
It is?
Yeah.
You're sexy.
What?
Nobody's ever called me sexy before.
Well, you are,
very sexy.
Especially when you dance.
What?
I gotta go, STEM.
Really?
Maybe I should join STEM, I killed it
on the math evaluation.
Did you?
Yup.
Ninety-two,
thank you very much.
Wow. That's great.
How'd you do?
Oh, oK.
Eighty-eight.
Eighty-eight's super good, above average!
Yep, that's me,
above average.
OK, gotta go.
Bye.
Uh, so, I've been thinkin'...
... about the tour.
Are you ok?
Yeah, I'm just...
got a lot on my mind, what's up?
What's going on?
Uh, Callie's friend, Kiara
we pulled her out of
a pretty messed up foster home the other night.
And Social Services is sending her back tomorrow.
Well, I wish I could say I find that shocking.
Yeah, right.
And then I'm pretty sure they're dealing.
Really?
Yeah, why else would you
let a tweaker into your house in the middle of the night?
Unless you're planning on doing a little business.
So, I, uh...
I'm thinking about making a house call.
Want some back up?
What is this?
I used to go here for group.
It's like drop-in center for foster kids.
Drop in for what?
Like, therapy, support groups, legal help.
Hey, there,
I'm Rafael. What can I do for you?
She's getting sent back to an abusive foster home,
her social worker won't do anything about it,
so we need to talk to someone who can
help get her a new placement or whatever.
Ok.
I'm really sorry to hear at.
Um, first, we'll have to get you a CASA...
That is a Court Appointed Special Advocate.
Here you go.
But it's gonna be a few weeks
before we can...
No, we don't have weeks.
Let's just go.
No, look, I'm sorry,
but it's really important
that we get you on a waitlist. If we...
A waitlist?
All we're ever freaking doing is waiting.
How long we gotta wait for
someone who's actually going to listen to us?
Someone that's actually help us.
How long's that gonna be?
Until we're 18?
I'm sorry,
I really am.
In the meantime, we could set
up an appointment with a counselor, try to...
Kiara is in a house with drug dealers.
OK, you think a little therapy is gonna help that?
The main reason we need the therapy
is because we keep getting put
in these screwed up situations in the first place!
This is pointless, let's go, this is a waste of time.
I don't understand, we already gave our statements.
Well, there were some inconsistencies, for instance,
you said that you didn't know the intruder,
but he seems to know you.
He's more of an acquaintance.
Where does he live?
In the neighborhood, I think.
Actually, he lives in Oceanside.
Maybe he works around here, I don't know.
He's unemployed.
Well, like I told you, we barely know him.
Then why'd you let him in your house?
Couldn't you see he was tweaked out of his mind?
Not at first. He seemed fine...
We didn't let him in.
Like I said in my statement, he forced his way.
So did you let him in or you didn't? He says yeah.
He's a tweaker,
who can believe anything he says, right?
No, that he was a tweaker.
You know where he's getting his drugs? Are you selling him?
You know what,
if you want to talk more, get a warrant.
If you wanna do this the hard way, maybe we will.
But let me tell you one thing...
Stef...
You let one of those foster kids get hurt,
at all, in any way, you let them come to any harm,
and I will dedicate my life to ruining yours.
Is that a threat?
No.
No threats.
I know my rights.
Thank you for your time.
I'm sure you do.
All that time spent in the prison library?
I may not be a lawyer, but I do know my rights.
What the hell is wrong with people?
What the hell is wrong with you?
You were totally over the line in there, and you know it.
I know this is frustrating as all get out,
and I know you hate feeling like there's nothing you can do,
feeling powerless.
But you can't go getting yourself in trouble, Stef.
You want IA on your ass again?
OK, thank you.
Oh, have you talked to Timothy yet?
Not yet, I just, uh, I haven't had a chance today.
OK, let me know how it goes.
Yeah.
Oh, you know,
I've been meaning to tell you,
Mariana stopped by my office today.
She did? Why?
Well, she asked me not to announce her during the assembly tomorrow,
said she didn't want all the attention.
Mariana? My Mariana?
Said she didn't want attention?
That girl used to make the whole family clap
every time she put on her shoes.
What is that about?
You ever wonder
what would've happened
if I hadn't called Stef and Lena when we were on the roof?
I only came back because of you, you know that.
That's not true.
It is true. It's...
more true that it should be.
It's kinda pathetic.
It's not pathetic.
So are you going to go back to Indiana?
With your mom?
I'm thinking about it. I don't know.
Maybe this time I'll just drive.
Maybe I'll hang out in New Mexico for a little while,
see if I can get abducted by aliens.
You know, I don't think that would be as fun as you think.
How would you know?
Oh, my whole life is kinda like being abducted by aliens.
Still?
Well, judge is talking about making me go and live with Robert.
Seriously? He's basically like a stranger.
It wouldn't be the first time.
So come with me.
Oh, uh, sorry.
So Monty told me you came to see her today?
To talk about the assembly tomorrow?
Oh yeah, I was just,
offering to help out, if...
You know, if she needed anything.
Really? Because that's not quite what she...
I guess I misunderstood.
Are you done with your homework?
Just getting to it.
Don't forget your math.
So, do I have to talk during this meeting? Or can I just listen?
Up to you.
Come on, what should I expect?
To sit in a room with a bunch of kids talking about
having drunk parents, OK?
Look, I only went once.
And I totally zoned out.
I usually end up getting pizza or something around the corner.
Don't tell Moms.
Why the hell did you wait so long to tell me that?
Screw Alateen, let's go!
So you wanna help out at the assembly, huh?
I just, Mat was so proud of his math score,
and I beat him by like six points, and I just...
just don't wanna seem smarter than your boyfriend?
Oh, honey,
if he can't handle the math genius and the pink nails, well,
then, he doesn't deserve you.
Don't play small, my love.
Not for him, not for anybody.
You're already really short.
This girl can't go more than five minutes without texting me.
She's like a Registered Text Offender.
Why do you put up with it?
If you don't like her, then just end it.
I like her, I guess.
She's really into me.
But it's not as simple as that.
Why not?
You can't tell moms.
You know what? I'm actually trying to go on tour, anyway,
it's probably best I don't know anything about...
Oh, what?
Please tell me that's not real.
I wish.
What were you thinking, dude?
I don't need you to tell me I'm an idiot, OK?
I already know.
Yeah, it was stupid,
and if Moms find out that, you are dead,
completely dead.
Well, I, uh... I have actually done worse. Much worse.
Like what?
Come on, I just told you.
It doesn't matter. Let's just say
I wish that I just had a tattoo.
You know, I think we could
probably still catch most of that meeting
if we hurry.
What's going on?
I just found out I have to see Robert in a few days.
Oh, really?
Yeah. I just thought that
after the whole Sophia thing that maybe they'd,
call it off or something.
She really tried to kill herself?
Why? She think Heaven's gonna be any nicer than that house?
Yeah...
Sorry. But for real.
Why would she do that?
I think she...
Sometimes it just gets to be too much, you know?
Oh, I know.
Of course you do.
I'm gonna be all right, Callie.
Even if they send me go back to that place,
I'm gonna be all right.
And I know they're dealing drugs,
it's the most obvious thing in the world, but they're smart.
We can't catch 'em. And now Kiara's gotta go back there.
What happens when the next tweaker goes crazy?
What if they have a gun?
I hate the system so much sometimes.
I mean, they'll basically start
shipping the kids out
as soon as you can prove you have an extra room.
What?
Standardized tests are worthless, you know that.
I've even heard you say it.
I don't disagree with you that they've become too important,
but they're the barometer that people use,
when they're talking about successful schools.
What people?
The people who decide who to give grants to.
The people who renew our charter. Those people.
Timothy, the school is in a financial crisis.
This is one of the things we have to do
to keep the doors open.
And if we wanna grow...
What do you mean, "grow"?
What, does Monty got some plan to franchise Anchor Beach?
This isn't a fast food restaurant!
Look, I took a pay cut
to come to a charter school so I could teach the way I want,
in the way I think actually makes a difference to the students.
I want these kids to be able to think,
I'm not gonna make them sit around all day
and regurgitate facts.
I respect that, you know that I do.
But we have to demonstrate that we're academically on par
with the other schools in the system.
So we're meant to teach to the test now?
Is that it?
And where does it stop?
Are we about to get a list of banned books?
Don't be hyperbolic.
This doesn't sound like you at all, Lena.
I thought you had final say when it came to academics here.
I do.
Really?
'Cause it doesn't seem like that.
They've never missed a payment, and they've got a year lease,
so I couldn't evict them if I wanted to.
How many people did they
say would be living in the apartment, again?
A husband and wife.
Mmm, so they didn't mention the three foster kids on the lease?
That sounds like a breech to me.
OK, sure. But I don't really care.
As long as they don't have a waterbed, I'm cool.
Would you be cool if I told you that
your tenants were under suspicion for selling drugs?
Now we'll be driving by two or three times a night,
shining spotlights in their windows
and the windows of everyone else in the building.
How will your other tenants feel about that?
Oh, and, I noticed some code violations.
Yes, yeah.
We're gonna have to send someone
from county down to do an inspection.
I think so.
Later.
Later.
Ninety-eight.
I got a 98. On the math exams.
Wait a sec, you did?
But why'd you tell me...
Because
even though I'm really smart, I can be super super stupid.
I was afraid that, I dunno, you'd be threatened if...
If I knew you kicked my ass in math.
you don't really think much of me, huh?
No,
I think you're awesome.
It's me I wonder about sometimes.
Come on, nerd, walk me to band practice.
So how'd it go? With Timothy?
Not great.
Really? Why not?
I thought you said I had, autonomy,
when it comes to academics here.
You do.
Are you sure about that?
Because I don't want to completely undermine
the really great work our teachers are doing,
just to get some test scores up.
Lena, I'm not trying to
impose on your authority over the teachers.
I just wanna make sure we get our charter renewed.
And that we qualify for as many funding streams as possible.
Ok.
Sorry, I...
And I know that we have to figure out a way to
work the system,
I get that.
When I said we're a team, Lena, I meant it.
I think you're an extraordinary educator.
I'm learning so much from you.
Thank you.
I respect you, too, I do. I...
I think I'm a little gun shy,
after our last principal.
So...
how did you leave things with Timothy?
Well, he said he's going to
teach the way he wants to teach and that's that.
Well, he's gonna have to give a little bit.
Do you think he's at all open to that?
I'm not sure.
Well, look, if he's not willing to work with the administration,
and teach the prescribed curriculum...
then we'll fire him.
Hey, Callie, Kiara?
Anybody home?
Kiara, Callie, you in there?
Hello, ladies.
You pack light.
Here.
No, that's... that's yours.
It was a gift.
I think you need it more than I do.
I mean, if you're gonna go,
gallivanting around the country, you're gonna
need something to remind you of home, right?
You're staying.
You should, too.
But not for me. You should stay for you.
I know you didn't come back for me, Wyatt.
You came back to finish school. So do it.
Finish it.
What about you? You gonna
finish what you started?
You know, you really only have two choices.
Either you give up or you keep trying.
Well,
if there's one thing I know about you,
you're not really the giving up kind.
Are you?
How's Callie?
She's sad... and worried.
I don't know how much more disappointment she can take
before she runs... again.
Well, at least those other kids
don't have to go back to that home. That's a big win.
On a technicality.
Meanwhile her friend is out on the street tonight.
Doing God knows what to survive.
You think they'll find her?
Well, hopefully she'll get arrested
for some minor crime before something worse happens to her.
I'm really sorry, honey.
What would you think about...
about Mike and I partnering again?
Really?
He drives me crazy, because he knows me so well.
But in a partner, you know that's a good thing.
I was talking with Mike and...
Wait,
you already talked to Mike about this?
No. I mean, yes, we discussed it, but,
you know, pending your approval.
I was very clear that it was pending your approval.
Can I please think about this?
Of course. I'm not even sure, so...
In other news...
Yes, please.
I have a small win for you.
Oh, for me?
Yes, I was talking to Monty.
She's so swell.
And she convinced me that
sending Brandon on tour could be really good,
even for college.
That it could set him apart from the other applicants.
So, I think we should let him go.
So she said what I said but
because she said it, it's right?
Yes, exactly.
Well, that's really funny,
because I was talking with Mike and
he convinced me that I was crazy, so there you go.
Of course.
Don't worry, I'm not going to go off on you again or anything.
I wouldn't blame you if you did.
I need your help with something.
Ok.
I wanna volunteer.
I have to do some kinda, independent study
for school so I can graduate and I wanna do it here.
I wanna help the kids who need it.
Where's your friend?
She ran away.
I think we can work something out.
You're a fighter.
We could always use a good fighter around here.
All righty. Well, if you're going to be volunteering here
I might as well show you around.
OK.
So, here we go.
