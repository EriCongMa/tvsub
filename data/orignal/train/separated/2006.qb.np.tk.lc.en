we just went through a civil war , and the world knows it .
you &apos;re using privileged information to target our clients .
pearson hardman is falling apart .
i never thought you &apos;d betray your own firm .
i did nothing wrong .
jesus !
you &apos;re the guy that nobody wants
but we can &apos;t get rid of .
you order me to rescind an offer
due to a firm @-@ wide hiring freeze .
two minutes later , you hire a fifth @-@ year .
katrina bennett .
i need you to waive my non @-@ compete ,
so i can take a position at another firm .
you went to louis ?
he didn &apos;t betray us , harvey .
he found the problem .
you may have fended off this attack ,
but we &apos;re not the only ones circling .
we fended you off , we &apos;ll fendff the rest .
i want my name on the door .
nice !
h @-@ o @-@ r @-@ s .
that means you get an &quot; e , &quot; you lose .
thank you . i can spell .
too bad you can &apos;t shoot .
crumpled paper .
winners don &apos;t blame the ball or the rim
or the wind speed in a closed @-@ off room .
the fan was on .
excuses don &apos;t win championships .
oh , yeah ? did michael jordan tell you that ?
no . i told him .
come on .
all right .
that was going in .
we &apos;re in the middle of a game !
if you two are playing horse ,
then one of you needs to thank me .
thank you .
pussies . out .
would you like to finish this game ?
winner gets to be name partner .
see , that &apos;s funny because you &apos;re already name partner--
derek portis died this weekend .
what took him so long ?
harvey .
what ?
he lived a long life . he was an old man .
he was 56 .
didn &apos;t look a day under 70 .
man dies , and the first thing you think
to say is that he looked older than he was .
no . that &apos;s the first thing i said .
the first thing i thought to say was ,
&quot; dead or alive , derek is a dick . &quot;
a dick that convinced folsom foods
to settle with us for $ 10 million .
well , we &apos;ll just have to tell his replacement
the settlement needs a signature .
it &apos;s not gonna be that easy .
why ? who &apos;s replacing him ?
i &apos;m gonna have the cornish hen ,
and we &apos;re gonna start with the foie gras special ,
two of them .
you &apos;re gonna love it .
just one .
i &apos;m okay . thank you .
dad .
i &apos;m watching what i eat .
on my birthday ?
i &apos;m trying to be disciplined .
listen ...
i &apos;m taking a case against pearson hardman .
it &apos;s folsom foods . do you know it ?
um , of course . it &apos;s the gender @-@ discrimination case .
well , i wanted to give you a chance to get off it ,
if you were on it .
well , i &apos;m not , but okay .
it &apos;s just that i know you keep a low profile at work .
that was supposed to be between me and mom .
well , i wish you could tell me these things ,
and i wish that you didn &apos;t keep the fact that i was your father a secret .
it &apos;s not a secret . i just don &apos;t broadcast it .
people treat me differently once they find out you &apos;re my dad .
are you worried that they &apos;re judging you
for being a paralegal ?
no , dad .
only you judge me for being a paralegal .
i do not judge you .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;m not planning on being a paralegal forever .
i know .
right there .
you can &apos;t even pretend to believe
i have what it takes to be a lawyer .
rachel , you are a beautiful woman ,
and you can do whatever you want .
beautiful , not smart .
honey , i am trying to give you a heads @-@ up .
and you &apos;re taking the whole thing as an indictment .
do you believe i have what it takes to be a lawyer ?
it &apos;s been five years ,
and ...
it hasn &apos;t happened .
i just wonder if you &apos;ve considered trying something else .
of all days--
&quot; hey , rachel , how was your birthday ? &quot;
&quot; great . my dad told me that i should aim lower . &quot;
please , rachel , that is not what i meant .
let &apos;s just have lunch .
no , dad .
really , i wouldn &apos;t want you to overeat on the day that you told me
that i won &apos;t amount to anything .
rachel .
高级助理
excuse me .
but i think you might be in the wrong office .
oh , i &apos;m in the right office .
you &apos;re katrina bennett ,
harvey &apos;s mysterious new hire .
i &apos;m afraid that puts me at a disadvantage ,
because i don &apos;t know who you are .
that &apos;s our problem right there .
we have a problem ?
oh , yeah , a big one .
you haven &apos;t come to see me yet .
again , i don &apos;t know who you--
i oversee the first- and second @-@ year associates .
it &apos;s a responsibility that i take as seriously
as holding the nuclear launch codes in my hands .
well , if you take it so seriously ,
then why are you in a fifth @-@ year associate &apos;s office ,
trimming your fingernails at her desk ?
trimming ?
this is a gold @-@ plated nickel alloy cuticle sculptor
from the south of denmark ,
and i will sculpt my nails wherever i damn well please .
why don &apos;t we see what you &apos;re up to ?
that &apos;s password @-@ protected .
please . prosecutor99-- third try .
that &apos;s a violation of my privacy .
oh , yeah ? who are you gonna tell ?
i see you &apos;re representing chad ritter .
and this is your defense ? wow , it &apos;s like you &apos;re a baboon .
i &apos;m in full control of mr. ritter &apos;s defense strategy .
it &apos;s not a strategy , it &apos;s a prayer ,
which is why i &apos;m going to be forced to supervise you .
i don &apos;t need a babysitter .
you &apos;re not getting a babysitter .
you &apos;re getting louis litt .
this is unacceptable .
be that as it may ,
you can either welcome my tutelage ,
or you can crawl back to the d.a. &apos; s office
from whence you came .
welcome to pearson hardman .
you got a minute ?
maybe .
it &apos;s not about us . it &apos;s about work .
oh . then , yeah .
folsom foods--
missy dietler &apos;s your paralegal on it , right ?
yeah , when she &apos;s not texting her boyfriend every five seconds
or her roommate , like , every other five seconds .
put me on instead .
no .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
the new opposing counsel is my dad .
your dad is robert zane ?
is it so hard to believe that my father &apos;s black ?
robert zane is black ?
you think this is a year @-@ round tan ?
i know who you are ,
but i can &apos;t believe that your father is the robert zane .
and you never said anything to me .
i don &apos;t like people here knowing .
oh , and i &apos;m just &quot; people &quot; ?
i mean , before , with the--okay .
look , i &apos;m offering to help you kick his ass .
are you gonna make room for me or not ?
before i answer that question ,
do you really think it &apos;s a good idea for you and i to work together ?
are you really asking me what is or isn &apos;t a good idea ?
look out , robert zane .
first of all , robert .
i &apos;m sorry to hear about derek portis .
oh , i appreciate your condolences , harvey ,
but the fact is , derek was a dick .
that &apos;s what i said .
that &apos;s what everybody says .
in any case , you didn &apos;t need to come all the way over here .
we could &apos;ve faxed you that settlement .
here you go , sir .
you and i both know i didn &apos;t come over here to sign .
i came to negotiate .
to renegotiate . which is bad faith .
the fact is you snookered derek .
10 million is double what any competent attorney would &apos;ve settled for .
should have been 5 . i &apos;ll give you 2 .
great . let &apos;s settle for 2 .
then i &apos;ll get you the keys to my condo ,
and maybe you &apos;ll drop a deuce on my pillow .
does it have a security code ? doorman ?
okay , you &apos;ve had your fun .
but we &apos;re not taking that offer .
then when would you like to schedule
sloane moseley &apos;s deposition ?
but you can &apos;t re @-@ depose her , mr. zane .
yes , he can .
and you &apos;ll use this opportunity
to show sloane moseley what she &apos;s in for .
when i get done with her ,
she &apos;s gonna jump at the 2 million .
that &apos;s more than bad faith . that &apos;s just cruel .
my offer stands .
uh , it was nice to meet you , sir .
what ?
&quot; sir &quot; ? &quot; mr. zane &quot; ?
why don &apos;t you just call him &quot; dad &quot; and get it over with ?
i was showing respect .
you &apos;re trying to get invited to thanksgiving dinner .
you think he &apos;d let me have one of the turkey legs ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what you &apos;re wanting him to let you have .
you think i didn &apos;t notice that rachel zane
just became the paralegal ?
she asked to be on it .
this better not end up with you in bed with her
telling her your secret .
not a problem .
we &apos;ll do it on the couch .
that was not respectful to you , me , or her .
or her father .
or your couch .
not my couch .
donna .
katrina .
you know who i am ?
i know who everybody is .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve heard . do you have a minute ?
well , eight days from now , i think i got a spare 45 seconds .
well , if you get a break ...
you think i can be bought with cookies ?
homemade , chocolate chip .
dark chocolate ?
semisweet .
a dollop of peanut butter ?
butterscotch .
walnuts ?
please .
pistachios .
the nut of royalty .
who told you my weak spot--mike ?
bertha .
big bertha from the d.a. &apos; s office ?
you &apos;re remembered fondly there .
aw , yeah .
i &apos;m remembered fondly everywhere .
okay , you got one minute .
who the hell is louis litt ?
this might take more than a minute .
how bad ?
i &apos;d like to throw him through a plateglass window .
not a totally unprecedented reaction .
harvey brought me in , so i don &apos;t want to piss him off .
i just want to know what the protocol is .
harvey won &apos;t stand in your way , but you listen to me .
you want to go toe @-@ to @-@ toe with louis ,
you better be prepared to go the distance .
jessica .
robert .
what can i do for you ?
i just want to talk , one name partner to another .
i want you to settle folsom foods .
i thought we were already settling folsom foods .
i proposed a slightly different number .
which harvey already said no to .
well , you know me .
i don &apos;t go for that gender @-@ discrimination stuff ,
but harvey negotiates like a girl .
no , he doesn &apos;t .
but he does style his hair like one .
i know .
what the hell is that ?
i don &apos;t know . what &apos;s your number ?
2 million .
that &apos;s an $ 8 million hit .
it &apos;s 8 million to your client , and you need a win .
do i ?
yeah , it &apos;s no secret that pearson hardman &apos;s
been taking it on the chin since daniel left .
well , that might mean something if i had a glass jaw .
partners have jumped ship , associates were poached ,
clients have bailed .
partners were pushed ,
associates were fired , and clients were retained .
well , you can spin it all you want .
but a high @-@ profile win--
that sure would look good .
if i lower my price .
a win &apos;s a win . it doesn &apos;t matter how ugly .
robert zane poked his nose into my office .
he try and hit on you ? i think he &apos;s always had a thing .
who doesn &apos;t ?
he thinks we &apos;re weak .
i know .
he pulled the settlement .
not on the case--us .
are you saying he went over my head ?
he heard about allison holt &apos;s bullshit last week .
let me guess .
he &apos;s pulling the same bullshit right now .
told me the world knows we need a win ,
tried to leverage that to get me to settle .
son of a bitch .
that &apos;s not bad faith . that &apos;s below the belt .
you know what i do to someone who hits me below the belt .
cut &apos; em off at the knees .
louis .
i just need--
i just--
yeah .
looks delicious . what is that ?
it &apos;s a spinach and kale power smoothie .
i &apos;m in the middle of my quarterly cleanse .
what do you want ?
to apologize ...
for any misunderstanding we might have had .
that you might have had .
i had . and it was huge .
i looked up your record .
you &apos;re a white @-@ collar genius .
go on .
i don &apos;t just accept your tutelage .
i &apos;m begging for your help .
well , beg away .
my motion to dismiss is wednesday
with judge mcintyre .
i &apos;ve never been able to connect with him .
yeah , that &apos;s &apos; cause you don &apos;t understand him .
well , all i know is he &apos;s punitive .
no , he &apos;s a stickler .
don &apos;t be late , don &apos;t be sloppy ,
don &apos;t be disrespectful , and he &apos;ll love you ,
just like he loves me .
since you know him so well ,
would you do me the honor of signing on as first chair ?
i can .
and i will .
you &apos;ve forgiven me with grace ,
and now you &apos;re saving me in my hour of need .
you &apos;re my knight in shining armor .
i will see @-@ eth you on wednesday , milady .
you wanted to see me ?
yes , but usually that means
the person tells donna they &apos;re here ,
then donna tells me . that &apos;s how it works .
donna &apos;s not there .
you think that &apos;s by accident ?
apparently not .
you know why you &apos;re here ?
because my last name is zane .
you know why donna isn &apos;t ?
because you know we &apos;re friends .
and you &apos;re about to ask me to do something
that she would tell me not to do .
and what exactly do i want to ask you ?
you want to know if i want to be in on the deposition .
you did ask on the case .
yes , i did .
and before you ask me if i &apos;m tough enough to be in there ,
i want you to know that i am tough enough .
that &apos;s not what i wanted to ask .
i want you to know if you think it &apos;ll rattle your father .
frankly , i don &apos;t think he &apos;d care .
good .
why good ?
because if that &apos;s what you think about him ,
then your relationship is worse than you think .
and he cares about you more than you know .
is this a joke ?
she doesn &apos;t need to be in there .
sloane moseley ?
you know who i &apos;m talking about .
you think having her in the room
is gonna keep me from doing my job ?
the relevant question is ,
what is she gonna think about you
after you eviscerate sloane moseley ?
you accuse me of being cruel ,
and you orchestrate this stunt .
we had a deal . you pulled it .
put the deal back on the table ,
this whole thing ends now .
harvey , what did you do ?
my job .
ms. moseley ?
why did you choose this particular field ?
because i have a love of food .
is it really a requirement of
excellence in an executive that one love food ?
it &apos;s not a requirement ,
but it &apos;s a food company .
and it &apos;s what i thought made it a perfect fit .
well , if it was such a perfect fit ,
why were you looking for a job in another field ?
because i spent nine years killing myself for your client ,
and got passed over for promotion after promotion
in favor of less @-@ qualified men .
okay , let me get this straight .
so you hit a wall , you blame my client .
and rather than figuring out what it takes
to make it in this perfect fit ,
you give up and fold like a house of cards .
i don &apos;t know what law school you went to .
but i was always taught that depositions require questions .
i went to harvard .
and here &apos;s your question .
after all these interviews for all these jobs ,
why didn &apos;t you just pursue one of them
and switch careers ?
it would require a step backward .
isn &apos;t it true it didn &apos;t require a step backward ?
but that &apos;s all you could find ,
because no one thought
you were any good at the job you had in the first place .
you don &apos;t know that .
i have sworn testimony from a headhunter
who said nobody wanted you .
okay , you &apos;re badgering her .
well , the truth is you &apos;re untalented and pathetic
and blaming other people
because you don &apos;t have the skills or the fortitude or anything else
to make it in your chosen field .
and you don &apos;t even have the courage to try something else .
i &apos;m sorry . i just wanted to make sure
that the court reporter got all that .
did you hear it down there ?
we heard it .
good .
i have a few more questions .
no .
this deposition is over .
this is the men &apos;s room . you know that , right ?
don &apos;t do that shit again .
excuse me ?
i don &apos;t need your protection .
that &apos;s what my dad does .
rachel , the only thing your father and i have in common
is that you &apos;re angry at both of us .
well , all you did in there was embarrass me .
embarrass you ?
i wasn &apos;t even watching you . i was watching our client .
you &apos;re trying to say you didn &apos;t call that off because of him ?
no , i &apos;m trying to say i didn &apos;t call it off because of you .
even though evidently you went to harvey
to ask in to make it about you .
i didn &apos;t go to harvey . he came to me .
look , rachel ,
you might want to make this zane versus zane ,
but it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s folsom foods versus our client .
but you &apos;re so eager to prove how tough you are
that you seem to have forgotten about her .
how dare you ?
how dare i what ?
i just got a $ 3,000 fine from judge mcintyre
for missing my own hearing .
i know .
i was wondering what happened to you .
i thought maybe your horse took fever , my liege .
you said it was wednesday , and you know it .
no . i said tuesday ...
as is confirmed in the documents i gave you .
this here is a fight you don &apos;t want to have .
i didn &apos;t pick it .
yeah , you did .
and now you &apos;re gonna pay that fine ,
and you &apos;re gonna write a letter expressing
how sorry you are to judge mcintyre .
no . i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m gonna count to five .
you can count to 500 .
the only thing i &apos;m sorry for is getting stuck with you .
you lied to me ...
and you know it .
oh , yeah ?
who you gonna tell ?
here it comes . speech number 162--
14 reasons why i &apos;m an asshole .
no , no . this is gonna be 216 .
that &apos;s uncharted territory .
and you &apos;re still not gonna like it .
if it &apos;s coming from you , that goes without saying .
look , i &apos;m just saying that you went out of your way
to put rachel in that deposition .
you promised uncharted territory .
we &apos;ve been here before .
no , usually you &apos;re accusing me of making things personal .
but this time you &apos;re making things personal for robert zane .
no . he made it personal .
and how exactly did he do that ?
he threatened our firm .
and on top of that , he tried to show sloane moseley
what she &apos;d be in for her if this goes to trial .
so i &apos;m just returning the favor .
yeah , well , it didn &apos;t seem to have much of an effect on him .
trust me . it will .
and did you think about the effect it &apos;ll have on sloane moseley ,
not to mention his daughter ?
here we are ,
right back to good old 162 .
did you misunderstand me when i said
to cut robert zane off at the knees ?
you too ?
oh , don &apos;t tell me you think i went too far .
i don &apos;t think you went far enough .
what ?
your client just called .
she wants to take zane &apos;s bullshit settlement .
you &apos;re gonna want to turn your hips
to transfer your weight through the ball .
nice job tracking me down .
you think you &apos;re the only one
who knows where judge benjamin plays ?
no .
but i &apos;m the only one here he plays with .
now , did you come here to caddie for me ?
i came here to negotiate .
bullshit .
your client caved after that deposition ,
because she knew she couldn &apos;t make it through a trial .
so i &apos;m gonna negotiate for you .
the offer on the table was 2 million .
it just went down to one .
robert .
now it &apos;s 500,000 .
you &apos;re pretty good at this .
remind me to have you buy my next car for me .
now it &apos;s 100,000 .
no , wait .
here .
no one wins if we go to war .
you don &apos;t have children , do you ?
you came to my house and threatened my firm .
&quot; your house &quot; ?
you put my little girl in that deposition
so she could see me shred that woman ,
which i did because that &apos;s my job .
and i was trying to protect that woman .
that was my job .
well , your client is scared shitless .
so i guess that means that i did my job a lot better than you did yours .
the settlement is gone .
you want something ...
you come take it at trial .
what do you need ?
a napkin .
no , social security number ,
date of birth , favorite color ,
allergy to nuts . i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;s it gonna take ?
i don &apos;t think i need to steal your father &apos;s identity just yet .
mike said he pulled the settlement ,
and we can &apos;t let that happen .
&quot; we &quot; ?
yes , &quot; we . &quot;
i work here too .
now i get it .
get--
no , no , no . this isn &apos;t about me and my father .
this is about the client .
no , i meant why donna likes you so much .
oh . thank you . i @-@ i like her too .
you know what ?
i was gonna give in and drop this case .
but now that you accosted me during my me time ,
i &apos;m gonna change my mind and do what you say .
you were gonna continue with it anyway .
yes .
right .
would you like to eat my bagel now too ?
oh , thank you . i ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
thank you .
what are you doing here ?
i just came by to tell you that you were right .
this is your case , not mine .
i &apos;m no longer first chair .
fine . we &apos;re best friends .
now please leave .
okay , i came to give you your files back .
all rise .
no way . i wasn &apos;t born yesterday .
i &apos;ve got my files right here .
okay , katrina , i &apos;m offering us both a way out here .
you keep whatever &apos;s in those files the hell away from me .
okay . you got me .
i &apos;m not to be trusted .
all right , let &apos;s get to it .
ms. bennett , i believe you have something for me .
your honor ,
mr. gibbs charged my client with securities fraud ,
but he neglected to disclose
discrepancies between the s.e.c. &apos; s findings and the irs &apos;s .
i have with me an exhibit .
i &apos;m sorry . you must &apos;ve accidentally somehow gotten
the file of pictures of me photoshopped as various american presidents .
i actually like that one .
i look pretty sharp , don &apos;t i ?
what you &apos;re really looking for was this ...
like i offered .
but per your request ,
i &apos;m gonna keep it the hell away from you .
is this some sort of joke ?
no . your honor .
bring that folder up here right now .
and if they &apos;re not legitimate court documents ,
you are in for one hell of a fine .
what are you working on ?
i &apos;m going through the reviews
for every executive promoted at folsom foods for the last five years .
you ?
reviews of every executive promoted at folsom foods
for the past five years .
you were right .
this is not zane versus zane .
and i don &apos;t want to talk about my dad anymore .
good .
it &apos;s like he was sitting me down
and looking me in the eye and telling me ...
what ?
that i &apos;m untalented and pathetic
and don &apos;t have the skills or the fortitude or anything else
it takes to make it in my chosen field .
he was talking to a client .
you got a 172 . you &apos;re going to law school .
he can &apos;t deny that .
yeah . he--he doesn &apos;t know that .
rachel , you--
when i , um ...
told him that i was high @-@ school salutatorian ...
guess what the first words out of his mouth were .
he wanted to know who the valedictorian was .
nope .
he said ...
&quot; number two ain &apos;t bad . &quot;
he thought it was funny .
everyone &apos;s always said that my mom is beautiful
and that my dad is smart and powerful .
and all i &apos;ve ever wanted is for him ...
he &apos;s never gonna see a different side of you
if you don &apos;t show him a different side of you .
he knew i was sitting right there .
you chose to be sitting right there .
louis .
hi , donna .
what can i do for you ?
not for me .
for katrina .
which one &apos;s katrina again ?
okay , you know what ?
you &apos;ve had your fun . time to let it go .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m not gonna let anything go
until that woman kneels before zod .
first of all , you know who zod is ?
and second of all , you think you &apos;re zod ?
general zod was a visionary leader
who was underappreciated by his entire planet .
of course i know who he is .
okay , well , katrina isn &apos;t superman ,
so what the hell do you want from her ?
okay . i get it .
harvey is superman , and he hired katrina ,
instead of you getting your first @-@ year .
her name was maria , and this is not about that .
what this is about
is me getting respect from a new employee , so ...
you beat her . you want her respect ?
make up with her and leave her alone .
oh , really , donna ? is that a sign of respect ?
leaving someone alone ,
like you and harvey left me alone since daniel ?
louis , harvey welcomed you back .
&quot; welcomed &quot; ?
he ripped up my letter of resignation ,
and he didn &apos;t say a word .
louis .
you know what ?
over the years ,
all the ribbing and all the practical jokes between you and harvey ,
i found that to be a sign of respect .
but you haven &apos;t had
one conversation with me since you told me
you never wanted to see my smug face again .
so you know what ? you go tell katrina
that i &apos;m not really in a forgiving mood .
i had an idea about folsom foods .
you too ?
what ?
you are not getting my bagel .
why would i want your bagel ?
never mind . what do you got ?
i checked the review of every promotion from the last five years .
every time they don &apos;t promote a woman ,
they use some combination of the same 16 words .
and the men ?
no .
what are the words ?
&quot; high @-@ strung , sensitive , aggressive , abrasive ... &quot;
coded language .
they went out of their way
to shield themselves from any one person bringing a gender @-@ discrimination suit ,
which means they treated all of them the same .
as a class .
yeah . and guess how many .
113 female employees across all 22 divisions .
you know what they have in common ?
all denied promotions due to the fact that they &apos;re women ,
not that they &apos;re untalented or pathetic
or lack the fortitude to excel in their chosen field .
this is a crock of shit .
you didn &apos;t want to settle for 2 million .
you &apos;ll be lucky to settle for 200 million .
robert , play all the golf you want .
judge benjamin isn &apos;t gonna get you out of this one .
how we doing today , boys ?
sir , need you to step over here , please .
easy , batman . i left my belt on .
well , if it &apos;s okay with you ,
i &apos;m gonna break out my trusty bat metal detector .
sir , we need you to raise your arms above your head , please .
okay , and i &apos;m gonna need your badge number .
how did those get there ?
sir , this is a weapon .
a weapon ?
they &apos;re my nail scissors , you asshole .
they &apos;re gold @-@ plated . they cost $ 2,000 .
you &apos;re gonna bring a $ 2,000 weapon into my courthouse ?
i &apos;m just saying i don &apos;t know even how they got there .
oh , well , maybe the riddler put them there .
okay , that &apos;s very funny . i &apos;m just saying ...
maybe it was , like , a big misunderstanding .
you say you don &apos;t know whose those are ?
oh , no , no , no , no , no , no . okay . i &apos;m sorry .
okay , let &apos;s just start over .
i &apos;m just gonna need them back .
i &apos;m placing you under arrest for carrying a concealed weapon
into a courthouse in the state of new york .
and for assaulting an officer of the court .
what ?
hey , eddie .
hey , ms. bennett . nice to see you again .
how are shelly and the kids ?
oh , they &apos;re doing great .
you know , i mean-- you know , she &apos;s--
yeah . no , they &apos;re doing great . thanks for asking .
it was her !
you think i don &apos;t know that ?
i always loved that picture .
me too .
tryouts for the school play .
minnie mouse .
i want to talk about the deposition .
rachel , you and i cannot talk about the case .
i said the deposition , not the case .
i don &apos;t give a shit about the case .
then why did you take it ?
because you took me out for my birthday
and told me you were picking a fight with my family
and said , &quot; sit it out , little girl . you can &apos;t handle this . &quot;
do you know why i love that picture ?
because i &apos;m still your little girl .
because you were happy .
you remember what happened at those tryouts ?
yeah . i didn &apos;t get the part .
and it killed you .
i was a child .
and most children let things go .
but you never tried out for a play again .
i did other things .
but why aren &apos;t you doing other things now ?
i am watching you fail
and stall and beat yourself up .
and it rips me up inside .
i took the lsats .
i got a 172 .
when ?
six weeks ago .
and you &apos;re just telling me now .
i didn &apos;t want to hear some joke about your 177 .
oh , but ...
when we were in that room ,
i know you were talking to her ,
but it was like you were aiming everything right at me .
and then i thought , &quot; you know what ?
maybe you look at all of us that way . &quot;
rachel .
well , we &apos;re not all the same .
and you need to toughen up
because i am not that little girl anymore .
so who &apos;s gonna kneel before zod now ?
i &apos;m not kneeling before anybody ,
let alone the person who framed me
and put me in this jail cell .
you humiliated me with judge mcintyre .
oh , please . you did the same thing .
missing an appearance is different
from looking like a buffoon in open court .
i gave you a way out , so don &apos;t come crying to me .
rapist , murderer ...
these are the kinds of people i &apos;m used to dealing with .
and you know where they are ?
spending the rest of their lives
realizing that i wasn &apos;t just a pretty face .
is that what you think this is about ?
you treated me like shit because i &apos;m a woman .
how dare you ? i worship women .
my mother , my grandmother-- god rest her soul--
hillary clinton , gwen stefani .
then what the hell is your problem ?
you took a job from somebody who deserved it more .
i went to resubmit my motion to dismiss .
turns out judge mcintyre already received it ...
from me .
the client needed it , and you wrote it .
for me to put my signature on it would just be wrong .
well , it worked .
are you ready to call a truce ?
are you gonna frame me for murder if i say no ?
not as long as you keep these in your own office .
robert .
what a coincidence seeing you here .
it &apos;s not a coincidence .
i didn &apos;t think it was .
i got to give it to your man harvey .
he comes full throttle .
he has his pros and cons .
they all do .
did you bring your checkbook ?
thank you .
i brought this .
you &apos;re going to decertify our class ?
i &apos;m gonna bust it wide open .
you see , after you brought my daughter to that deposition ,
i realized not all women are the same .
no way this gets busted up into 113 cases .
i &apos;d say a minimum of 45 .
some you may win , some you may lose .
all of which are gonna drain your resources .
you &apos;re threatening me again .
i have another option .
which is what ?
i told you-- not all women are the same .
you got to be kidding me .
&quot; not all women are the same . &quot; what the hell does that mean ?
he wants to merge .
what ?
pearson zane .
no . no way . i &apos;m not doing that .
oh , excuse me ?
we didn &apos;t fight off hardman to end up here .
well , you went after the man &apos;s daughter ,
which is what put us here .
you told me to cut him off at the knees .
if you &apos;re gonna go that low to put someone down ,
then you better make damn sure that they don &apos;t get back up .
it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s robert or not .
they &apos;re gonna keep coming .
until i put your name on the door .
that &apos;s not what this is about .
we can only take these hits for so long .
death by a thousand cuts .
all right .
well , if they &apos;re gonna keep coming ,
then we may as well just make it one big brawl .
jessica . what a coincidence .
skip it .
i &apos;m guessing by your tone
that our merger is off the table ?
it was never on the table .
what &apos;s this ?
a press release .
&quot; female head of major law firm
&quot; is going to the ends of the earth
to fight 45 cases of gender discrimination . &quot;
this is bullshit .
look at me .
you &apos;ll cripple your firm .
i would rather lose my firm
than get married staring down the barrel of a shotgun .
you &apos;re not gonna be able to have my daughter
in every deposition .
this is 45 cases .
and it will cost you 45 times the amount
that you could settle for right here .
yeah , i know you .
the chess master-- you think you &apos;re bobby fischer .
this isn &apos;t chess . it &apos;s dominoes .
now , the first case might be tough .
but after that ,
one by one ...
and when it &apos;s all said and done ,
i &apos;ll be the last one standing ,
holding a big , fat check in my hand .
remind me to get the papers ready
for , uh , the deposition tomorrow , the 19th .
uh , that would ...
holy shit .
who the hell did this ?
all right , norma , if you &apos;re gonna keep letting people
into this office like this ,
then what the hell good are you ?
oh , yeah , wait .
and by the way , remind me to buy socks for next week .
i &apos;m running low .
i got to admit ,
you do look kind of hot as a bad boy .
you tell me right now this was not katrina bennett ,
&apos;cause this is not a truce .
oh , please .
katrina had nothing to do with this .
then this was you ?
no .
harvey ?
you &apos;re not lying .
nope .
does this mean that you and i are good ?
no .
not yet .
bye , louis .
wait , don &apos;t go .
we &apos;re back !
no , we &apos;re not .
oh , shit .
i &apos;m dropping the case .
why ?
because i never should have taken it in the first place .
dad .
you said it yourself .
i picked a fight with your family ,
told you to sit it out ,
and those aren &apos;t words a man should ever hear from--
from his daughter .
you &apos;re not tough enough ?
not even close .
well , we never finished our lunch .
tomorrow ?
tomorrow .
but we &apos;ll have to pick a new place .
i already tried that foie gras of yours .
you did ?
yep .
and ?
it tasted like ass .
come on .
looks like you guys made up .
it &apos;s a start .
i didn &apos;t want to interrupt ,
and i know i &apos;m a few days late ,
but ...
is that my ...
your lsats score ?
yeah . i figured ...
you shouldn &apos;t keep things like this a secret .
thanks , mike .
happy birthday .
how did you know it was my birthday ?
oh , right . i must have told you once .
you did , yeah . i mean , i forgot .
yeah , this is from donna .
come on .
that is exac ...
i just saw that ...
yeah , that &apos;s how fast i am .
you &apos;re impressed . it &apos;s no big deal .
how did it go down ?
did you tell him if he puts one of ours in the hospital ,
we put one of his in the morgue ?
no , harvey . i did not quote the untouchables to the man .
you should &apos;ve , &quot; you stinkin &apos; irish pig . &quot;
that &apos;s really funny ,
&quot; you lying member of a no @-@ good ... &quot;
robert .
oh , i hate to interrupt in the middle
of a untouchables quote fest .
two doors down , they &apos;re doing steel magnolias .
you &apos;d fit right in .
i &apos;m more of a beaches man myself .
i assume you &apos;re here to settle .
i &apos;m afraid not .
i wanted to tell you that
my firm has a conflict of interest ,
so i decided to farm out the case .
whose ass are we gonna kick now ?
actually , an old classmate of mine .
let me guess ...
