your hair looks so different .
well , get used to it , boys .
&apos;cause we &apos;re single , we &apos;re sophisticated .
and we just went to a place to get blow @-@ outs .
what &apos;s a blow @-@ out ?
you know how it &apos;s possible
to make your own hair look amazing ?
uh , i do not .
yeah , you know whose hair i admire ?
jesus . man , dude &apos;s hair get overlooked
because of all the miracles and stuff .
so , there &apos;s a place that just blows out your hair ?
well , they wash it first .
so , essentially they create a problem ,
and then charge you to fix it .
here &apos;s a , a business idea i just thought of .
why don &apos;t i break the heels off your shoe ,
and then charge you to glue them back on ?
or , uh , take your sore back and adjust it .
which would , uh , just make me a chiropractor .
you ladies need to be very careful .
blow @-@ out can give a woman too much confidence .
make them take on things that they can &apos;t handle .
hillary clinton .
oh , hey , ken . you can just
put the beer behind the bar .
oh , actually i was coming over here
to talk to the pretty ladies .
nice hair .
hey , jess .
hey , cece .

um , could you excuse us for a second ?
yeah .
you played that all wrong , you stupid idiot .
cece , i know these guys are weird , but
parties have cute guys who aren &apos;t schmidt .
what did charisma say while he was washing our hair ?
he said he was worried about taylor swift living in new york all alone .
well , yeah , we all are , but he also said
that we need to embrace our freedom .
we &apos;re single . we can do whatever we want !
the only thing stopping us is us .
and charisma made us promise
not to waste these blow @-@ outs .
our hair does look so good right now .
let &apos;s do this ! let &apos;s go to this party !
let &apos;s see where this journey takes us !
good morning .
do you want to hear a funny story ?
this green pillow over here ,
i always use it in between my legs
like a ... like a second person .
but it found its proper home underneath your head today .
hey , hey ... mamma mia !
he slipped in the sauce .
bookmark this one .
coach , get in here ! we &apos;re watching videos
of italians falling down .
oh , he &apos;s on a jog with may . you know ,
i think he might &apos;ve met his match with that one .
rumor has it they haven &apos;t even kissed yet .
what was all that noise in their room
if they haven &apos;t kissed yet ? that &apos;s weird .

sorry i can &apos;t stay .
i &apos;m performing at a benefit today .
oh . i &apos;m playing
bach &apos;s &quot; cello suite no. 1 , &quot;
and all i have left to learn is
the cadenza movement , so it &apos;s ...

look , i had no choice , okay ?
he &apos;s sleeping on my shirt .
we need to go ! walk of shame !
let &apos;s make a move ...
wait , a minute . why do women have to have a label
for going home in the morning
when for men it &apos;s just ... going home .
why don &apos;t we just call ourselves what we are ?
two respectable women ...
rushing to their car .
great .
the sun ! hellfire !

早六点至晚六点 禁止停车
what are we gonna do ?
my phone &apos;s dead .
my phone is dead , too .
i have no cash .
now , what are we gonna do ?
are we gonna walk ?
my feet are wrecked , okay ?
and carrying shoes ?
that &apos;s legit walk of shame .
please stop saying &quot; walk of shame . &quot;
also &quot; legit . &quot;
not crazy about that word , either .
if that south african runner who killed his girlfriend
can run with no legs ,
we can walk in heels .
excuse you !
those little bitches throwing us shade ?
hey ! keep it moving !
this is a middle school vice principal
and can give both of you detention .
hey , would one of you let us
use your phone in exchange for ...
cece ?
what ? mm @-@ hmm .
cheese and a condom ?
it &apos;s for emergencies .
do you think nick and winston should come to may &apos;s thing ?
no .
i mean , i &apos;m so freaked out
that they &apos;re gonna embarrass me .
i &apos;m barely holding my own
with may &apos;s friends as it is .
it &apos;s always neo @-@ romanticism
with that guy-- like rihm ,
rochberg , zwilich .
you know what song i find neo @-@ romantic ?
it &apos;s monday night football ?
why is it , like , weird right now ?
it &apos;s a good thing that i &apos;m coming with you .
i know a ton about classical music .
i played the ghost of rachmaninoff in a loosely based
high school production of shine .
now , do you think i &apos;m crazy for , like , thinking like that ?
like , what do you think about nick and winston coming ?
you know , i brought nick to a work dinner once .
that was fun !
now , that place was fancy .
vest without a shirt ?
i mean , it &apos;s a clean look .
it &apos;s just not for that occasion . you @-@ you don &apos;t think
we should tell them not to come , though , right ?
i think we can tell them whatever we want .
oh , hey , hey . and then ...
so , that &apos;s , it &apos;s his side .
hey , nick !
what &apos;s up , man ?
nick , pick up , pick up , pick up , pick up !
the voice mailbox for ...
penis wilson .
... is full . good @-@ bye .
and there it is .
all the numbers i know by heart .
that &apos;s more than me .
learn from us .
also , never open a line of credit
for your boyfriend no matter how talented of an artist he is .
uh , we are walking .
we &apos;re walking .
all right .
this is a legit walk of shame .
oh , yeah .
rough start , ladies !
it was the blow @-@ out .
it was the blow @-@ out .
it &apos;s gonna be okay . come on , let &apos;s go .
oh , my god , they look so comfy .
okay , you got it , okay ? you got it .
just give it a good ...
oh , god , i need those sneakers .
so close , so close .
you got it on this one , you got it , you got it .
yeah .
no ! no !
let &apos;s follow that train .
look at it , just sitting there , so full and so watery .
if we steal that water ,
are we criminals ?
if we cross this fence ,
are we crossing a line that we can never ... ?
shut up , we are going in .
makes sense .
ugh , i can &apos;t believe we have to go
to that stupid music thing .
i just found these two @-@ for @-@ one
coupons to the water park .
wow . they reopened the wave pool
because it &apos;s been two years to the day since that guy died .
r.i.p. mike beakman .
all right , you know what ?
i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll take one for the team .
you guys go to the water park ,
and i &apos;ll go with coach .
really ?
my eyes react poorly
to children &apos;s urine anyway .
don &apos;t ask me how i know that .
sweet .
you guys are gonna have so much fun without us .
yeah , come on , coach .
let &apos;s go put on our most scrotum @-@ crushing trousers .
thanks a lot , guys .
those lousy serpents .
they don &apos;t want us to come .
damn lousy serpents .
they must think we &apos;re stupid .
i don &apos;t want to go ...
... but i don &apos;t like the idea of not going
because they don &apos;t want us to go ,
rather than not going because we don &apos;t want to go .
that &apos;s right , &apos; cause if we don &apos;t go ,
then who gonna go
when we don &apos;t want to , &apos; cause we go .
right ? rewind .
come on , i &apos;m being very clear here .
where are we going and why ?
we &apos;re going everywhere for both reasons .
how do you do it so smooth ?
just ... ... exhale .
i just can &apos;t do it . i don &apos;t even care about it .
just gonna ...
oh , that &apos;s heavy .
yeah .
okay .
let &apos;s just knock it over . push it ov-- push it .
push , push ... go .
oh ! fall back ,
fall back , fall back , fall back .
we &apos;re trapped .
now what ? wait until the kid &apos;s party &apos;s over ?
kids unwrap presents so slowly .
i know . kids are so slow .
i think this is rock bottom .
cece ...
i have to tell you something embarrassing .

i didn &apos;t sleep
with bear claw last night .
i did something even worse .
we made up a musical
about woodland creatures .
owls and squirrels and deer
raccoon and caribou ,
and otters ...
get out of here , you &apos;re not welcome .
get out of here ,
get out of here .
caribou , caribou ...
it &apos;s true .
why did you make it seem like ...
because i didn &apos;t have a one @-@ night stand
like a normal woman .
i stayed up all night
pretending to be a singing tree .
i &apos;m just a dumb old tree
you &apos;re not , take it back
nobody ever pets me @-@ e @-@ e @-@ e ...
&apos;cause you &apos;re just a tree .
they just eat my nuts .
eat my nuts , eat my nuts .
you &apos;re right . that is way more shameful .
all right .
confession .
i did not sleep with ken , either .
yeah , we started hooking up
and then i called him ... schmidt .
that &apos;s okay . it happens .
twice .
whatever .
four times .
okay , that &apos;s bad .
i know , i felt so bad afterwards ,
i straightened up his room .
i am a grown woman
that is in love with her ex @-@ boyfriend
that has a girlfriend .
and i &apos;ve been stealing my neighbor &apos;s wi @-@ fi .
i mean , what have i become ?
this day is about to turn around .

i used to play the violin .
then i became a real musician .
because your instrument &apos;s bigger , right ?
cello knowledge .
yeah .
the cello is bigger .
nice .
the hell are they doing here ?
i don &apos;t know .
they &apos;re drinking at a normal pace .
there &apos;s nothing stuck to them .

i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s an expression , but ...

did it again . i don &apos;t know why .
why you guys dressed up all nice ? huh ?
talking all polite and stuff . what @-@ what &apos;s going on ?
oh , we &apos;re just here for the culture
and , uh , the spectacle of it all .
really ?
and to make you look like a stupid piece of crap
for thinking we &apos;d be an embarrassment to you .
i &apos;m patting you down .
hey . i &apos;m an american citizen .
i request a female if you &apos;re gonna do that .

you think we &apos;re on a walk of shame .
i didn &apos;t , but ...
congratulations .
you spend your sundays having cupcake parties
at your beautiful house with your cute little
half @-@ asian kid and your daddy diaper bag ...
i think someone might need a visit from the &quot; rest police . &quot;
just because i don &apos;t have a husband
or a baby or a house
doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m not living right .
we &apos;re still growing and changing .
yeah .
and that &apos;s a good thing .
look at this hair .
this is single @-@ girl hair .
this is adventure hair .
this isn &apos;t boring , married ,
settled hair .
this is ... this is fun .
we &apos;re fun .
you know what i did last night ?
i got totally obliterated ,
and i made up a musical fable with
a guy named bear claw ,
and it was better than sex .
* i &apos;m a little fox , but i &apos;m not that sly *
* what can i say ? *
* i &apos;m an honest little guy . *
well , i &apos;m glad things are good ...
you know what , genzlinger ?
i don &apos;t care what you think of me .
&apos;cause this is my journey .
welcome to my freaking journey .
great , i wish you luck ...
you ready ?
yeah . yeah , yeah .
that &apos;s not jenn .
nope .
this is not my house , okay ?
this is not a daddy diaper bag ,
this is a bag of sadness .
because i am a party clown .
i &apos;m actually a musical party clown , okay ?
so no one &apos;s had a more shameful walk this morning than me .
what happened to jenn ?
thanks for bringing that up .
salt in the wound .
she left me .
you know what i did last night ?
i &apos;m gonna tell you .
i masturbated to pornography
that i had to draw on the back of an envelope .
he &apos;s great with kids .
who are you ?
i &apos;m a liza minnelli impersonator .
so ...
ah , guys , look , i don &apos;t see much of the toothpick coming out .
so , best move--
push it all the way in , and get it from the other side .
am i right ? you guys agree ?
how could you guys do this to me ?
we didn &apos;t do anything .
you embarrassed yourself .
actually , you embarrassed us .
and you do it all the time , coach .
like how you sit on the hood of your car
when you pump gas into it .
i mean , what , are you in dukes of hazzard , you idiot ?
i saw isaiah thomas do it on a poster once ,
and it was cool .
and what are you laughing at , all right ?
what ?
you put chapstick on like a little girl
putting on lipstick for the first time .
it &apos;s way too much puckering .
winston , you know what , you shut up .
cold busted .
you &apos;re the most embarrassing one of our friends by far .
with your singing .
outfits .
and the crystals .
your mural .
the mustache .
your fauxhawk .
your bell .
puzzles .
cat .
fyi-- you guys live with the cat , too .
but at least i get to reap the benefits .
that ...
look , it &apos;s not what it looks like , my man .
um , we &apos;re just trying to squeeze something out of my buddy .
we &apos;ll be done when it comes out .
well , maybe it &apos;s not gonna work with may .
she &apos;s too good for me .
i should just go back to having soulless sex
with beautiful women i share no emotional connection ...
all my hard work .
may didn &apos;t start liking you
because you play some dumb instrument .
she started liking you because you &apos;re cocky .
and you &apos;re funny .
what , you &apos;re afraid of her
because she plays the standing @-@ up guitar ?
he &apos;s right , coach ,
i don &apos;t know why we &apos;re trying so hard
to make you fit in here .
you &apos;re coach ,
sex in a sweat suit . yeah .
if i tought you one thing , it &apos;s lead out with confidence .
follow up with comedy .
and number trey , your home run , your triple--
have great looks .
i got &apos; em , and i passed them on to you .
so get out there , you beautiful peacock .
shake your tail feathers .
i mean , i &apos;d rather not get these compliments with my pants down ,
but appreciate it .
paul , you don &apos;t have to do this if you don &apos;t want to .
you don &apos;t have to clown for these people .
yes , you do .
she said ...
open yourself up to the journey .
look , if taylor swift can live alone in new york ,
just think what you can do .
the only thing stopping you is you .
yeah .
ma &apos;am , i will not clown for you today .
or any day thereafter .
what are you doing ?
i am going on a journey .
this is my freaking journey .
we &apos;re taking back the morning .
happy birthday to your little one .
may , we run in different circles .
my circle &apos;s not even really a circle .
it &apos;s more of a swirling mass of idiots .
but , uh , that &apos;s me .
yeah , you didn &apos;t have to come back in here
to tell me you were an idiot .
no .
what i need to tell you is i like you .
and that , um ...
and that i hate classical music .
i &apos;m sorry , i do-- i hate it .
i mean , there &apos;s so many better kinds of music now , it &apos;s ...
okay .
but if you &apos;re playing it , i want to listen .
&apos;cause you mean a lot to me .
all right .
i &apos;m gonna play you a song , and if you can name it ...
then we can give this another shot .
if you don &apos;t want to do this , just ... it &apos;s ... i &apos;m fine .
