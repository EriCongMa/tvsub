what the ...
what are you doing ?
saving your mom .
all this for a muddy cop car and a dead pig ?
who &apos;s that for ?
jessica dilaurentis . she &apos;s moving back .
back to their old house ?
are you sure the rv is safe in here ?
it &apos;ll be fine for a few days .
there &apos;s stuff in there that can bring us all down .
就把撒谎精带给我 亲亲 -a
&quot; closed caskets keep secrets .
his is open and exposes yours . &quot;
there &apos;s something in that coffin that &apos;s incriminating to us .
why are you calling me on my mom &apos;s phone ?
who is that ?
i &apos;m officer holbrooke .
my partner and i are investigating the murders
of officer reynolds and detective wilden .
just here to find out the truth .
&quot; the truth won &apos;t set you free , bitches . &quot;
when was the last time your mom called you from new york ?
i don &apos;t know , the day before yesterday .
i haven &apos;t really been keeping track .
have you checked your phone ?
she called me from the hotel room , emily .
she has no cell .
who was that freaky woman at the funeral ?
which freaky woman ? there was a couple , han .
the one in black , with the veil ,
and she was just diving into that town car .
speaking of freaks , where &apos;s melissa ?
spencer ?
what ?
where &apos;s your sister been ?
d.c. she &apos;s interviewing for an internship
with who , satan ?
wait a second .
you think that melissa was the woman in black ?
do you ?
i didn &apos;t really get a good look at her .
i was trying not to wet myself
when that new cop made a beeline over for us .
well , he can beeline all he wants .
we didn &apos;t do anything to wilden .
except for throw his car in a lake
and leave fingerprints all over it
when &quot; a &quot; pulled it out .
spencer , what are you doing with my french fries ?
i &apos;m re @-@ created the geography around the lodge
to see if it &apos;s even possible
that the person who jumped out of the plane
could rescue you three from a burning building .
wait . put down the mozzarella stick .
it &apos;s mine .
no , it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s a plane .
spencer , you can stack all the food that you want ,
it wasn &apos;t alison .
why are you so sure ?
because i went to her funeral twice .
we never saw a body .
we &apos;ve been through this .
okay ? you were oxygen @-@ deprived .
she wasn &apos;t , and you saw her , right ?
oh . so now i &apos;m the crazy one . gimme my mozzarella back .
okay , it looked a lot like alison , and i &apos;m not ruling it out .
so you &apos;re saying that you think
her mom is laying out all of her old pillows and toys
because she &apos;s expecting her return ?
it was just one toy . a clown .
god , emily , please . not you , too .
hey , guys . sorry i &apos;m late .
so i &apos;ve been thinking a lot about the alison question .
really ? i &apos;ve been thinking a lot
about how you put my mom &apos;s phone in wilden &apos;s casket .
nice .
what else do i have to do
to prove to you that we &apos;re in this together ?
i gave you that chip from his dash cam ,
you were all there when my computer was hacked--
i have cashed in all of my &quot; get out of hell free &quot; cards ,
so if you don &apos;t believe
me and you still think i &apos;m keeping secrets ,
go out there and search that rv for yourselves .
what ?
lead the way . we &apos;ll follow .
why are we doing this now ?
because if we wait until later
she can get back here before us and purge .
what was that ?
it was a bird . a beaver .
do you need to wait in the car ?
i &apos;m just saying i don &apos;t even
know what we &apos;re supposed to be looking for .
oh , my god .
oh , my god , it &apos;s gone .
what do you mean it &apos;s gone ?
this is where i left it .
i mean , you saw me , hanna .
i haven &apos;t been back here since . i swear .
somebody stole it .
somebody ?
let &apos;s get out of here .
that somebody wasn &apos;t me !
wait .
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , my gosh ! mona !
mona !
are you okay ?
what happened ?
被遗弃在学校后面 她吓坏了
hey .
hey , stranger .
didn &apos;t even hear you come in last night .
yeah , well , the door was closed ,
so i just figured that you were sleeping .
i was .
it was a rough drive . probably should have taken the train .
so , how was new york ?
i didn &apos;t see much of it .
the bank booked a conference room with no windows .
how are you holding up ?
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
it means i haven &apos;t seen you in a week , and i &apos;m curious .
i &apos;m okay .
i went to the funeral .
wilden &apos;s .
and how was that ?
weird .
i mean , i-- i wanted him gone ,
and i &apos;ll probably go to hell for saying that , but ...
i hope not . then you &apos;ll have to see him again .
mom , you don &apos;t think i had anything to do with this , do you ?
i mean , i know i wanted him dead , but you don &apos;t think that--
hanna , that thought never even crossed my mind .
what do you think happened to him ?
i think that detective wilden had more enemies than friends
and i think one of those people decided to do us all a favor .
use a plate , please .
mom .
you lost your phone .
where did you find that ?
it was in the mailbox .
i guess someone decided to return it .
i must have left it at the hotel desk
when i was checking out .
maybe they messengered it back .
don &apos;t look so shocked , hanna .
there are still some honest people in the world .
she &apos;s a mess .
she can barely move .
has this wicked bruise on her shoulder .
she landed on a huge rock .
why didn &apos;t she land on mona ?
hanna , the car tried to flatten me and mona .
emily hadn &apos;t jumped in we would have been road kill .
seriously , if &quot; a &apos;s &quot; new plan
is to try to pick off the tiny ones in the herd--
okay , we are not a herd .
it &apos;s an expression .
yeah , for cows .
well , i &apos;ve been crated .
what does that make me ?
my mom didn &apos;t even blink when i pulled her phone out .
it was like she knew it was stolen
and she was just waiting for me to spill .
it &apos;s not gonna help you or your mom
to tell her that &quot; a &quot; is back .
yeah , and framing her for a murder .
so what am i supposed to do now , nothing ?
i mean , if mona didn &apos;t put that phone in the casket ,
then who did ?
and who sent that tape of us outside of wilden &apos;s car ?
and who stole mona &apos;s hate @-@ mobile ?
melissa ? jenna ? shana ?
you could always go ask her yourself .
han , i wasn &apos;t serious . hanna .
hey . you savin &apos; that seat for your gal @-@ pal jenna ?
excuse me ?
don &apos;t act like you haven &apos;t heard that name before .
jen @-@ na . why &apos;d you skip wilden &apos;s funeral ?
hanna .
jenna was there . why weren &apos;t you ?
you three were all buds , right ?
where were you yesterday ?
i was at swim practice ,
but i don &apos;t recall signing a contract
that said i had to report that to you .
hanna , let &apos;s go .
so swimming laps was more important
than saying good @-@ bye to an old friend ?
what old friend ?
the groggy scumbag you and jenna
scraped off the road the night he was hit by a car .
hanna , come on .
hey . got your text . what &apos;d you want to show me ?
your future dorm room .
or should i say &quot; ours . &quot;
what do you think ?
i like .
seriously ?
i was going for cozy ,
but then it looked like
cozy was one puffy drape away from &quot; grey gardens . &quot;
paige , slow down .
i haven &apos;t even heard from the stanford coach .
they &apos;re gonna want you .
maybe not as much as i do , but that &apos;s a good thing .
okay , truth . what would you change ?
well , i , um ...
i &apos;d push the beds a little closer together .
what &apos;s wrong ?
um , nothing .
i ... slept weird .
might not be able to swim tomorrow .
what ? ! em ! you have to swim tomorrow .
it &apos;s because ...
it &apos;ll be fine .
it &apos;s just a little bit more stiff than anything .
um , show me those puffy drapes .
why didn &apos;t you want to come up ?
what ? oh , i had to return a message .
you ready ?
actually , you know what ?
i was thinking of bagging school today .
do you want to go get some breakfast ?
i can &apos;t . i have to get to a job today .
i thought it started on monday .
i have to be on @-@ site today .
toby , what &apos;s going on ?
why don &apos;t you want to answer a phone call ?
hey , what happened to never keeping secrets from each other again ?
i am not keeping secrets . let &apos;s go , spencer .
mona was attacked last night .
we followed her out to where she parked the rv .
it &apos;s gone . and when mona got back into her car ,
&quot; a &quot; or somebody tried to kill her .
why does this not seem like breaking news to you ?
because i have to go .
okay ? we can talk about this later .
will we ?
so , tackle last four chapters ,
we &apos;ll go over the historical context on monday ,
and for those of you who are ahead ,
and can &apos;t enough of doomed romance ,
um , pick up &quot; east of eden &quot; for extra credit .
spence , you comin &apos; ?
uh , yeah . i &apos;ll catch up to you guys at lunch .
okay , we &apos;ll meet you in the courtyard .
you okay , spencer ?
yeah .
i , um ...
i heard from upenn this morning ...
and i didn &apos;t get in .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry , uh ...
are there any other schools--
not for my family , no .
i &apos;ll be the first one not to go .
sorry . i , um , i haven &apos;t told my parents ,
and i haven &apos;t even told my friends .
i don &apos;t really know why i told you .
so i &apos;d just really appreciate it if you--
no , no . no . i won &apos;t say a word .
i &apos;ve actually been asked to help out with college essays .
so when you &apos;re ready to think of other schools ,
i &apos;m here for you .
it &apos;s really important to have a second choice ,
even if you had your heart set on something else .
if i were you ,
i would actually apply to other schools right away .
and you can email me the essay
and maybe we can work on it over the weekend .
thanks .
hey , spencer .
it &apos;s their loss .
what &apos;s keeping you from saying something ?
she spent a whole summer dating her .
leave paige out of it .
she &apos;s already in it , em .
she knows shana better than any of us .
what was that ?
i &apos;m trying to find a heating pad .
is your shoulder worse ?
i nearly fainted after paige &apos;s hug .
you didn &apos;t tell her ?
no .
i &apos;m not gonna put her on &quot; a &apos;s &quot; hit list again .
well , i mean , are you gonna be okay tomorrow ?
don &apos;t you have a big swim meet ?
okay , can we not use &quot; big &quot; and &quot; meet &quot; in the same sentence ?
maybe you can wear a swimsuit with sleeves .
i mean , i spent two summers at fat camp swimming in a parka .
em ? are you gonna a able to swim ?
i don &apos;t have a choice .
weird .
no , it &apos;s not . i have to break records .
stanford wants--
no . not that .
my ... my mom tried cleaning her manolos with a toothbrush .
if it &apos;s not your toothbrush , why do you care ?
they &apos;re silk . why wouldn &apos;t she just take them to the cleaners ?
maybe she &apos;s trying to save money .
look , i have to go . paige is coming soon .
no , she said she was holed up all week .
how muddy does a hotel lobby get ?
we &apos;ll talk later .
can i help you ?
hi . yeah , does holden strauss teach here ?
he &apos;s not here on fridays .
he used the word &quot; teach &quot; ?
well , i know that he just likes to come here to fight and stuff .
he does . but last time i checked , i was still the teacher .
sorry . i don &apos;t mean to be rude .
you &apos;re not . holden is .
i &apos;m jake .
hi . do you teach privately ?
when would you like to start ?
today .
or tomorrow . just soon .
sounds urgent . you thinking about jumping into a gang ?
no . i just have a bunch of school stuff coming up next month .
i can see you tomorrow at eleven .
perfect . i &apos;ll be here .
can you give me a name ,
or do you just go by &quot; holden &apos;s friend &quot; ?
oh , sorry . it was so quiet i thought you were sleeping .
i have to finish this by monday .
how &apos;s it going ?
how do you think it &apos;s going ?
last book i finished was
&quot; the very hungry caterpillar . &quot;
well , i won &apos;t disturb you .
mom , did you leave your manolos in a bag under the sink ?
what about them ?
nothing .
how &apos;d they get so trashed ?
did you go on a hike through central park ?
why are you worrying about my clothes
when you can &apos;t find the strength to hang up your own ?
i &apos;m just curious .
i know that you love those shoes--
they &apos;re just shoes , hanna .
finish your book . and get some sleep .
hey , spence , it &apos;s me again .
why haven &apos;t you called me back ?
and where are you on a saturday morning at ten o &apos;clock ?
i need to talk to you .
hanna ?
i thought that was you .
hi , mrs. dilaurentis .
how are you doing ?
good .
you &apos;ve been doing a lot of work .
well , everything i did yesterday was undone by an angry raccoon ,
or whatever &apos;s living under that porch .
can i ask you something ?
if i fill that area in with iceberg roses ,
will it make the gray shingles look stodgy ?
um , i don &apos;t ... really have an opinion .
really ?
god knows alison would .
i &apos;ll clump the whites over here ...
tippi .
what was that ?
that ? that was a gift from my late mother @-@ in @-@ law .
come . meet tippi .
i can &apos;t keep coming back .
it &apos;s uncanny , isn &apos;t it ?
careful what you say around her .
it may come back to haunt you .
want a sweet potato ?
no , tippi . we don &apos;t .
i &apos;m guessing mother d asked her that fifty times a day .
miss me ?
god , she sounds just like ali .
when she went to georgia ,
she spent more time with that bird
than she did her grandmother .
they shared a room .
don &apos;t worry , sweetie ,
i don &apos;t think she taught her &quot; hefty hanna . &quot;
it was kind of a weird question for a college essay .
&quot; discuss one situation in which you were right
and wish you hadn &apos;t been . &quot;
i could name ten .
well , your high school experience
hasn &apos;t been exactly typical .
you hated it .
no . no .
i thought it was very well written ,
i thought it was very moving , i just ...
question whether this is something
you &apos;d want to share with an admissions committee .
why ?
i think colleges now
more than ever are concerned with emotional stability ,
and choosing what to reveal
and what to keep under wraps--
what should i keep under wraps ?
a friend of mine was murdered .
i was bullied . i did have a mental breakdown .
right , but nobody &apos;s asking for full disclosure .
i think submitting this as @-@ is
would be a huge mistake .
look , spencer ,
if you throw this all out there ,
your many attractive qualities might be overshadowed .
honesty may not be the best policy .
so you want me to pretend to be somebody that i &apos;m not .
no . but you are more than this .
yeah , but i wouldn &apos;t be if it weren &apos;t for that .
i mean , why can &apos;t i just take a risk and be real and ,
i don &apos;t know , have a little faith
that maybe somebody who reads this
will actually be impressed that i left radley ,
that i &apos;m not still there
making crafts out of uncooked macaroni .
spencer , i--
no
when has being dishonest ever helped me ?
or you ? or anyone ?
i think we &apos;re movin &apos; too fast .
and i &apos;m guessin &apos; that hurt .
yeah , it did a little .
but it actually felt pretty good .
let &apos;s take a breath .
review our positions , go over basic blocks .
okay . we &apos;ll get back to the kicking , right ?
i really like the kicking .
aria ...
tang soo do is about defense , not offense .
no , i understand ,
but what if somebody attacks me from behind ?
hold up . is this a real concern ?
is someone threatening you ?
no , not right now .
look , i &apos;m small , okay ?
people look at me as an easy target .
it &apos;s a law of the universe , right ?
okay , are my feet far enough apart ?
they &apos;re perfect .
aria ...
this relationship doesn &apos;t work
unless there &apos;s a level of trust between us .
do you trust me ?
don &apos;t really know you .
true .
but the best way you can find out
if you can trust somebody
is to trust them .
sometimes .
look , i &apos;m not some scary ball of paranoia , okay ?
i &apos;ve just got a lot of stuff going on .
i just recently broke up with my boyfriend ...
is that who you &apos;re afraid of ?
no .
no , i &apos;m not afraid , i just ...
i don &apos;t know , i just feel ...
angry .
feeling powerless .
aren &apos;t you ?
we can &apos;t defend ourselves until we feel safe in our own skin .
do you ...
feel safe in your own skin ?
no .
but you will .
mrs. dilaurentis , when the police found ali &apos;s ...
the police didn &apos;t find her .
it was workers tearing down the gazebo .
right .
but once the police were called ,
did you see ...
see what ?
what was left of her ?
the yellow blouse was enough , hanna .
do you know what you would like ?
i &apos;ll have whatever you &apos;re having .
except for the bloody mary .
i &apos;m not ordering a cocktail .
go for it . i won &apos;t tell dad .
maybe a small glass of chablis .
ali , you &apos;ve got to take my word on this .
that top was way too revealing .
i &apos;m happy with the yellow one .
would it be okay if i stayed down the shore till tuesday ?
by yourself ? no .
i won &apos;t be alone .
when you and daddy leave ,
aria and spencer will take the train down .
and hanna wants to come too .
so you &apos;ve already invited them .
sort of .
look , we need a major sleepover .
and why can &apos;t that happen here ?
because it would suck .
aria and emily would find some excuse to leave ,
and spencer will sneak out in the middle of the night .
and hanna &apos;s creeped out by jason .
he stares at her chest .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just not big on leaving five teenagers
in a cape may beach rental .
please , mom . we need this .
our group &apos;s falling apart , and summer &apos;s almost over ...
alison , take no for an answer .
please .
i think we should share the greek salad .
it &apos;s big enough for two .
what are you doing ?
alison , don &apos;t . it &apos;s been quite a morning already .
do you hear me ? don &apos;t do this here .
i will leave you at this table .
i mean it .
i &apos;ll let you land face @-@ first on the sidewalk .
alison , breathe .
i said , breathe .
breathe ! ! !
okay , fine . one night .
she perfected that stunt when she was five years old .
just to torture me .
ali never invited us to cape may that summer .
i &apos;m not surprised .
all the empty beer bottles that i found later
made me wonder if she was running with an older crowd .
probably a boy .
you know anybody who wants a bird ?
i have enough voices in my head .
now push up .
slowly turn to face me and step through .
step through .
s @-@ slowly .
that &apos;s it .
cool .
let &apos;s try it again .
what &apos;s that ?
our time &apos;s up , but let &apos;s keep going .
once more .
okay .
there you go .
you &apos;ve got it .
that &apos;s-- that &apos;s perfect .
how do you feel ? in control ?
i am so sorry .
no , uh--
i have no idea why i just did that .
it &apos;s fine . i-- i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what you came here for--
no , i didn &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t . i &apos;ll see you tuesday .
stupid .
i just--
mona ! hurry , we &apos;re late .
let &apos;s go , mona . get in .
thank you .
he was a detour , aria .
i was tuning to the cops behind him .
you can &apos;t be chatting up any cops in broad daylight , mona .
if i can see you , so can &quot; a. &quot;
we &apos;re gonna have to pay for this---
stop talking to me like i &apos;m a bucket of rocks .
i &apos;m scoping this out for all of us .
what you should be asking is what i overheard
before you screeched up like chicken frickin &apos; little .
those dudes behind him were special investigators .
they &apos;ve taped off the south shore of torch lake as a crime scene .
they found wilden &apos;s footprints .
they think he was there the night he was whacked .
and he wasn &apos;t alone . the other shoeprints they found
were a woman &apos;s . heels . high ones .
the kind alison liked to wear .
why are you doing that ?
because according to people in the know , it &apos;s too honest .
what that person doesn &apos;t realize is that if i don &apos;t offer that up ,
&quot; a &apos;s &quot; gonna serve it up on a silver platter .
why are you here , toby ?
i don &apos;t want to play any more of your games .
i moved the rv .
&quot; a &quot; asked for it in exchange for
something that i wanted .
wh @-@ what did you want ?
did you think that making
more deals with the devil was gonna protect us ?
how did you even know where mona parked it ?
i didn &apos;t . that was already on &quot; a &apos;s &quot; radar . all i did was--
no , all you did was give up the one thing
that actually could have helped us figure out--
i know .
what is that ?
a transcript .
from my mother &apos;s doctor at radley .
it was written on the night--
what night ?
the night she killed herself .
i brought the wrong cap .
what are you doing back here ?
you wouldn &apos;t have a spare , would you ?
i won &apos;t tell anybody you gave it to the rival team .
sorry , i don &apos;t .
that looks painful .
why does your friend hanna
think i was buddies with that dead cop ?
i don &apos;t like to talk before the race .
i hear you .
i tried to say hey to paige ,
but she &apos;s already in a zone .
you &apos;d think she &apos;d chill now that she &apos;s got that scholarship .
how do you know about that ?
please . nobody keeps that a secret .
i also heard from our coach that
there &apos;s still one spot open on stanford &apos;s team .
i &apos;m guessing you have your eye on that prize ?
i do too . may the best girl win .
&quot; she &apos;s put her focus on the future . &quot;
&quot; much of our session was devoted to feelings of hope-- &quot;
&quot; wanting to spend the holidays with her family . &quot;
&quot; making up for lost time with her son . &quot;
&quot; thanking him for being so patient . &quot;
are you sure that you want me to--
&quot; when asked what prompted the turnaround , &quot;
&quot; ms. cavanaugh was quite clear : &quot;
&quot; she &apos;d already missed out on too much &quot;
&quot; and was no longer concerned with being judged . &quot;
&quot; it was time to return some of the love that had sustained her , &quot;
especially from her son . &quot;
does that sound like someone who
stole a key later that day and jumped out a window ?
toby
does it ?
does that sound like someone
who didn &apos;t even care enough to say good @-@ bye ?
does it ?
toby , it doesn &apos;t .
it doesn &apos;t .
but your mom might have said this to her doctor
so that he wouldn &apos;t know her plan .
no .
toby , you know , some people ,
they find an inner peace once they decide--
we never saw this . her doctor never shared that .
this place is covering something up , and i need to know more .
you &apos;re gonna trust information that &quot; a &quot; supplies ?
come on , what does &quot; a &quot; ultimately want from you ?
please , you can &apos;t tell her about this .
or anyone else .
toby , i--
promise me .
okay .
come in .
come on , em ! go , girl !
come on , emily !
come on , emily ! come on !
emily !
emily !
come on ! emily !
you need stitches .
my shoulders just got hurt .
you hit your head .
emily , stay with us . how did you hurt your shoulder ?
everybody back to the pool area . please get back .
can i just--
not now , paige . later .
how did you hurt your shoulder ?
fell off my bike .
can i please finish the race ? please ?
how are we supposed to trust anything that she ever says ?
i mean , who knows what she told those cops ?
this is mona . she started lying when she was a fetus .
hey , why was toby so upset when he left ?
were you guys fighting ?
no . no . go back to the fetus .
did i tell you i &apos;m done with martial arts ?
yeah . i can &apos;t even walk down that street . i kissed him .
who ?
my instructor .
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess &apos; cause i miss ezra
and i almost got killed last thursday .
and he smells like cinnamon .
who does ?
jake .
who &apos;s jake ?
my instructor .
pay attention .
thanks for returning my calls .
where did you get that ?
mrs. dilaurentis &apos;s porch .
you stole her bird ?
she gave it to me .
and it &apos;s not just a bird , okay ? it talks .
alison and tippi were roommates in georgia .
this bird probably knows more about
what happened to ali than any of us .
it talks a lot .
you think it &apos;s gonna tell us if ali &apos;s still alive ?
wow . i thought that i was losing it .
if you guys would shut up for a minute ,
maybe it would say something .
does it take requests ?
you know what ?
ali was hooking up with someone in cape may that summer ,
and she was telling her mom that it was us .
yeah . we know . wilden .
no , we don &apos;t know .
if wilden had his own boat ,
why would he be staying at ali &apos;s parents &apos; beach house ?
that &apos;s a really great question ,
but we can &apos;t ask him because he &apos;s dead .
and that lake is now a crime scene .
the shoreline that we threw the car--
aria , you have to stop , okay ?
that was weeks ago , and you guys were wearing pumps .
the footprints that the police are looking for are high heels .
wait . whose high heels ?
well , the cops don &apos;t know ,
but mona &apos;s trying to tell us that they &apos;re alison &apos;s .
was it ... muddy that night ?
hey , board shorts . miss me ?
did you just hear that ?
yeah . i &apos;m standing right next to you .
wait .
look , i came here for a reason .
what &apos;s wrong ?
hey , what &apos;s this song ?
what &apos;s she singing ?
if &quot; a &quot; tries to pin this whole wilden thing on my mom--
hanna , you don &apos;t have to worry .
your mom wasn &apos;t even in rosewood the night
that wilden was killed .
hey . you hungry ?
do you want to order in or go out ?
mom ...
were you in new york the whole time you were gone ?
of course .
where else would i be ?
here .
did you come back to have it out with wilden ?
hanna , if you &apos;re asking if i killed him ,
the answer &apos;s no .
i did not kill detective wilden .
hey , it &apos;s hanna . leave a message .
come get this bird , hanna . it &apos;s driving me crazy .
pretty bird .
pretty bird .
you can &apos;t ignore me !
what ? what do you want ?
hanna , it &apos;s not a song that tippi &apos;s singing .
it &apos;s a phone number .
hi .
hey .
sorry i showed up at your door . i--
i kinda felt like it &apos;s something i should do in person anyway .
can i come in ?
yeah , sure .
look , i had a hunch you might not be coming back .
why do you say that ?
took me by surprise .
the--the kiss .
i don &apos;t want you to think i &apos;m not interested ,
because ... i am .
but if you &apos;d like to grab a coffee or a meal sometime ...
maybe you &apos;re not comfortable
with the whole teacher @-@ student thing .
could be complicated .
yeah .
looks like somebody really needs to reach you .
we can do this another time .
jake .
can we do this over that coffee ?
is your head pounding ? maybe there &apos;s something you can take .
no , i can &apos;t . okay ? that &apos;s why i lost count during the race ,
because i couldn &apos;t judge the distance .
you &apos;ve never done that .
i never swam on painkillers .
how come you didn &apos;t tell me how much pain you were in ?
because if i told you then i &apos;d have to tell you why .
i messed up my shoulder saving aria and mona .
saving them from what ?
not what . who .
&quot; a &quot; ? emily , why would you keep this from me ?
because i don &apos;t want to live in that space anymore .
and i don &apos;t want you to live there either .
i want to live in that room on your computer ,
and i want to be with you-- only you--
away from this town .
em--
just you and me together ,
safe , and starting a real life .
maybe we already have .
it could be a business .
but saturday night they &apos;re closed .
just let it ring , okay ?
where is this area code , anyways ?
york county .
did ali know anybody from there ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m guessing that she called her beach hotty
&quot; board shorts . &quot;
obsessively from georgia ,
and that &apos;s how tippi learned this number .
maybe you just dialed the number wrong .
i didn &apos;t !
how do you know ? you dialed it , not tippi .
okay , let &apos;s just go record the bird .
you guys , she &apos;s been singing this phone number on a loop .
i &apos;ve heard it like twenty times .
so have i , but i want someone to answer .
so aria , let &apos;s just go get your phone
and we &apos;ll record it together .
okay .
what &apos;s going on ?
tippi &apos;s gone .
yeah , but how ? who opened that cage ?
probably the same person who opened the window .
