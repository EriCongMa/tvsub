helicopter . helicopter .
mm @-@ hmm . yes !
i don &apos;t like activities .
i wanted to hang out with gloria
and read my robert ludlum novels .
i got eight of &apos; em loaded up on my book reader thing here .
i mean , i love my family .
i love &apos; em at dinners , i love &apos; em at barbecues ,
but do i have to love &apos; em in hawaii ?
thanks , daryl .
i know i got a lot of baggage ,
but don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m seeing a therapist .
just kidding . i &apos;m fine .
daryl , i know these guys .
can i borrow your hat ? this will be hilarious .
no .
okay .
aloha , uncle phil !
you guys excited about the trip ?
oh , we &apos;re so excited . you know , this is my first time .
really ? yeah , i know it &apos;s surprising .
people always say i scream &quot; hawaii . &quot;
who says that ?
people .
what people ?
you don &apos;t know them .
hey , lily ! hi .
oh , no ! oh , n-
i forgot my wallet .
oh , that &apos;s all right . i have cash .
no , no . i can &apos;t get on the plane without my i.d.
thanks a lot , cam .
how is this my fault ?
because if you had done what i asked you to do this morning ,
then i wouldn &apos;t have been overwhelmed
and i would have remembered my wallet .
all right . we still need to pack lily &apos;s toys ,
print the boarding passes .
oh , stop the newspaper .
wait . what are you doing ? i just packed those .
she just looks so cute in this outfit .
i want her looking her best for jasper .
nothing you just said made any sense to me .
jasper and his mother are coming over for a playdate .
we scheduled it weeks ago .
we &apos;re about to leave for the airport .
not for an hour .
and this is the only time jasper could do it .
how full is jasper &apos;s calendar ?
this is a coup . when you get in with jasper ,
doors open .
he &apos;s a legacy at happy time preschool .
we &apos;re kissing up to a 10 @-@ month @-@ old ?
i just want him to like us .
okay , that &apos;s them .
but just in and out .
we still have a million things to do .
would you relax ? you always worry . it always gets done .
oh , and we &apos;re methodists , so-
uh , who am i kidding ? i &apos;m not making this flight .
uh @-@ uh . i can get you home
and back before the plane takes off . let &apos;s go .
daryl- see if you can stall the plane .
that &apos;s- i will get to you later .
i really- i really don &apos;t think there &apos;s enough time .
go . i &apos;ll meet you at the gate . go .
but you won &apos;t get on the plane without me , right ?
oh . well-
seriously ? you were gonna get on the plane ? cam !
just go !
nope . gotta get that one .
okay . i can &apos;t-
oh ! that &apos;s as fast as she goes .
just drive .
just drive .
i &apos;ll get the luggage !
hey , check out that cute guy .
he &apos;s out of your league . he &apos;s reading a book .
i know .
here today , gone to maui !
hey . you seen phil ?
oh , he drove mitchell back to get his wallet .
what ?
yeah . he said he &apos;s gonna make it back in time ,
but i think it &apos;s gonna be close .
so he left me here .
haley is still asleep , and i have no idea where luke is .
and are you even ready ?
my bag &apos;s in the living room . everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
okay . fine . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m a little tense .
coffee &apos;ll help that .
you &apos;re right .
we &apos;ve been over this . air travel is incredibly safe .
i know . i know . but at the end of the day ,
it is still a building on its side
being thrown from one place to another .
with a movie .
not helping .
you wanna take something , maybe calm your nerves ?
no . no . i wanna be alert if the kids need me .
what a mom . sometimes i wish you were my mom .
oh , god , phil . i &apos;m already feeling a little queasy .
i hate this feeling . i hate it .
and it &apos;s just gonna get worse and worse until the flight .
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
uncle phil &apos;s here .
great job , buddy ! first one ready .
haley and alex , let &apos;s go !
bless you .
coming .
all right . come on , girls .
okay . this is why we practice .
come on through . come through .
fifteen seconds .
are we ready ?
i think so .
it &apos;s go time .
straight to the car . slow is smooth , and smooth is fast .
go , go , go , go , go . slow is smooth , and smooth is fast .
very nice !
alright . let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go .
i think we got an extra couple of seconds .
no ,
we don &apos;t .
dad , come on !
i will never get tired of this .
me neither .
you know what would be cool , mum ?
what &apos;s that ?
if the plane flew into a storm
and crash @-@ landed onto an island like in lost .
something wrong there , cam ?
well , i &apos;m just breaking in a new pair of hiking shoes .
this always happens . all the men in my family have wide ankles .
i have an uncle that can only wear bell bottoms . hand to god .
i wasn &apos;t doubtin &apos; ya .
just why are you wearing the hiking shoes ?
surprise !
what , again ?
every morning the whole family &apos;s gonna go hiking .
then at the end of the week ,
we all gonna make it to the top of the volcano .
every morning , huh ?
yes . when cam suggested it ,
i knew you were gonna love it .
oh , so this was your idea ?
happy birthday , jay .
ah , thanks , buddy . ow .
hi , sweetheart !
i &apos;m going hiking !
she &apos;s smiling !
thank you .
look , mom , i &apos;m pregnant .
yeah . you still gotta take your dramamine .
oh , does somebody get a little motion sickness ?
yeah , i throw up all the time .
oh , well , then dramamine &apos;s the way to go .
what the hell are you doing ?
oh , i &apos;m just trying to keep her awake
so she &apos;ll sleep on the plane .
nobody likes a crying baby on a flight .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s very stressful .
uh , last year i flew back from new york ...
next to a baby who was very upset the entire flight ,
and it was hell .
i was on that flight with you , and i don &apos;t recall-
oh , i get it . you &apos;re talking about me .
that &apos;s very funny .
yeah , we couldn &apos;t get tickets to billy elliot .
all he wanted to do was dance , and that &apos;s my story .
five hours of this .
i just want to dance at the ballet !
dramamine . oh , i wish i had that the last time i flew .
tell you , the plane was rocking up and down , back and forth .
i thought the wings were gonna snap off , honestly .
you do it yourself . use your teeth .
i @-@ is this the best way to go ? what about the freeway ?
relax , punkin . i got this .
it &apos;s all about knowing the route .
you &apos;re talking to a guy who made his way
through college by driving a pedicab .
you know what one of those is ?
yes . yes .
i just saw one pass us .
quick- who sang &quot; evil woman &quot; ?
what ?
elo !
phil , where the hell are you ?
uh , let &apos;s see . oh , shoot ! i just missed my turn .
you &apos;re supposed to be here with me .
i told you , i get more and more freaked out
as we get closer to the flight .
well , i know , but mitch- okay , you know what ?
i was counting on you to be here , so thanks a lot .
she &apos;s pretty tightly wound .
some people are just built that way .
honestly , could you drive any slower ?
guess where the world &apos;s largest wind generator is .
is it right behind me ?
nope . it &apos;s on the island of oahu .
i &apos;m thinking about using it in my song about hawaii .
what song ?
didn &apos;t mom tell you ?
surprise !
the whole family &apos;s putting on a show for you for your birthday .
everybody &apos;s performing . even phil brought his dummy .
isn &apos;t that great ?
jay ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
i was just thinking how tragic it would be
if i fell into that volcano .
ay , papi , don &apos;t say that .
not yet , sweetie . not yet .
see ? he &apos;s perfect .
look at him getting coffee and not putting chocolate in it .
he &apos;s so mature .
what about dylan ?
dylan &apos;s no that guy .
haley ! come on !
we &apos;re leaving in two minutes ! get up !
oh , my god !
oh , no . is it tomorrow ?
dylan ! what are you doing here ?
i was gonna go , but then you fell asleep ,
and since you &apos;re leaving for a week ,
i want to stare at you as long as i could .
you have to go . my parents are gonna think we did it .
as if .
get out of the house and make sure that nobody sees you .
i &apos;ii miss you .
when you &apos;re gone , it &apos;s like i &apos;m
this prisoner trapped in a cell of loneliness .
that &apos;s beautiful , but you have to go .
okay .
i hate this feeling . i hate it .
and it &apos;s just gonna get worse and worse until the flight . - hey !
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
uncle phil &apos;s here .
great job , buddy ! first one ready .
thanks .
haley and alex , let &apos;s go ! coming .

i think we got an extra couple of seconds .
no ,
we don &apos;t .
dad , come on !
oh , no !

whee ! oh , no .
this is where your realtor training comes in handy .
looks like a standard porter and sons d @-@ model top lock .
one quick swipe oughta pop it .
all aboard .
okay .
there we go .
nice and easy .
yeah , you &apos;re pinching . you &apos;re pinching .
i &apos;m sorry .
if you show enough houses , you learn all the tricks .
every realtor is just a ninja in a blazer .
the average burglar breaks in
and leaves clues everywhere ,
but not me .
i &apos;m completely clueless .
you &apos;re sure i &apos;m not too heavy ?
please , you weigh less than my paintball gear .
okay . yup .
there we go . we are in .
off @-@ load . on we go . squeezing .
i &apos;m going for a ride .
you all right ?
yup . i &apos;m good . i &apos;m good .

just making it a little tougher on the next guy .
you got to get up pretty early- son of a-
are you all right ?
yes , i am .
just , uh , almost killed myself on your fire truck .
that &apos;s not ours . that &apos;s jasper &apos;s .
you know jasper ?
i sold a house to his parents .
how did you ever get a playdate with him ?
let &apos;s go ! please , can- yeah . okay .
look at him . he &apos;s sketching .
he &apos;s like leonardo dicaprio in titanic .
i bet he goes to art school .
do you think he &apos;s sketching us ?
yeah . &quot; us . &quot;
check @-@ in for the 5 : 30 flight to boston may board at this time .
and contact .
it &apos;s dylan .
&quot; i &apos;m trapped . &quot; yeah , yeah , yeah . what a drama queen .
we will go whale washing ,
explore the tropical forest ,
get back into the nature .
that sounds fun . mm @-@ hmm .
thanks .
thank you .
your attention , please .
will manny delgado please report to gate 22 @-@ a ?
manny delgado to gate 22 @-@ a.
check it out , grandpa . the dramamine &apos;s working .
i &apos;m not dizzy .
yeah . oh , watch the drink , kid .
ooh ! ooh , my ludlums !
i &apos;m sorry , grandpa .
all right . relax , relax .
we might be okay here .
it &apos;s not fair . it &apos;s not fair .
excuse me , ma &apos;am . is this manny delgado ?
yes .
your son &apos;s name is on a no @-@ fly list .
ay , please , we &apos;ve been through this at the check @-@ in .
he &apos;s not the same manny delgado .
i &apos;m just a boy trying to bring style back to travel .
we just have a few questions to ask .
no , this is a mistake .
where is my husband ? wait . jay !
step this way , ma &apos;am .
ma &apos;am , step this way , please .
son , step this way .
jay ! no pushing . jay !
you make it a double ? i &apos;m traveling with my family .
no problem .
must be a lot easier just living with a guy .
yeah , life would be simpler if i was gay .
do you think you could get in the fast lane ?
oh , i could totally get in the fast lane .
i mean the road .
oh , i &apos;m getting a text . what does it say ?
um- oh , g- well , it &apos;s nothing . it &apos;s the alarm company .
it says your house was broken into .
what ?
it &apos;s nothing . they &apos;ll take care of it . just drive !
what happened ?
okay , fun airport game .
you pick out a traveler , you come up with their entire story .
okay . this guy , his name &apos;s henry .
he &apos;s on his way to phoenix to visit his grandmother ,
whose name is , uh-
oh ! pass .
too hard . your turn .
okay . fine .
i see a woman , uh , wracked with fear ,
whose husband has abandoned her .
where ? where ? who is she ?
me .
i made it perfectly clear to phil that i needed him here .
oh . it &apos;s going around . mitchell &apos;s mad at me too .
he thinks because i didn &apos;t help him pack this morning ,
he forgot his wallet .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry to be snippy .
it &apos;s just ... i &apos;m a little upset with cam .
i needed his help this morning , and he let me down .
that doesn &apos;t sound like him .
you asked him to do something and he didn &apos;t do it ?
but he never asked ! i mean , all he said was ,
&quot; lily &apos;s bag needs to be packed
and the newspaper needs to be canceled . &quot;
that sounds to me like he was asking for help .
sounds to me like you expected him to read your mind .
what am i , a psychic ?
no ! it &apos;s not about reading minds .
it &apos;s about knowing what your partner needs .
here &apos;s an idea : just say &quot; help me . &quot;
you don &apos;t even have to say &quot; me , &quot; just &quot; help . &quot;
then he &apos;ll know exactly what you want .
you won &apos;t have to get all mad .
i &apos;m not mad . it &apos;s just-
you wanna believe you &apos;re on the same wavelength as someone ,
and then it &apos;s just-
it &apos;s a little disheartening when you find out you &apos;re not .
that &apos;s all .
what &apos;s frustrating is i would do anything for mitchell ,
and @-@ and frankly , it &apos;s a little hurtful that he doesn &apos;t know that .
so , airports , huh ?
yeah .
are you drawing something there ?
yeah . it &apos;s no good .
tortured artist . classic .
oh , yeah .
it &apos;s a robot .
oh , yeah . sure is .
what &apos;s behind him ?
a dinosaur .
it &apos;s for school . we &apos;re supposed to make a comic strip .
we had to do that too , back in the eighth-
he was 14 years old .
shut up .
&quot; he &apos;s my soul mate . &quot;
i d-
this is the final boarding announcement for-
what you drinking ?
dad . hey .
mostly tonic actually , thanks to my new sponsor here .
i &apos;m a little jittery about flying .
what are you talking about ? you fly all the time .
yeah , i know . this started just in the last couple years .
i think i &apos;m just- i &apos;m nervous
&apos;cause i &apos;ve got so much to lose now , you know ?
what about you ?
i &apos;m taking a break from my vacation .
we haven &apos;t even started yet .
well , i gotta figure , i might not have a lot of time for myself ,
you know , what with the luaus , the hiking , the talent shows .
are you not happy that we &apos;re coming with you ?
it &apos;s just not what i expected .
but , dad , doesn &apos;t it feel good to know ...
that your whole family is willing to drop everything to be with you ,
to fly across the ocean in a steel coffin ?
i &apos;m gonna finish that .
it &apos;s not you guys . i love the family .
it just kinda feels like gloria &apos;s going out of her way ...
not to spend time with me .
you don &apos;t believe that , do you ?
oh , come on , dad !
that is so crazy and so adorable .
that woman loves you .
well , i didn &apos;t say i wasn &apos;t lovable .
it &apos;s not every wife that would spend the money
to fly a family to hawaii .
okay . where does everybody think gloria &apos;s money comes from ?
so , what kind of business did you have in japan ?
i &apos;ve never been to japan .
you didn &apos;t go to osaka
november 2003 to attend an electronics trade show ?
i was four .
enough . why don &apos;t you question the other people on the gate , huh ?
did you see the old lady with the cane ?
what if she has a ceramic knife
in there that can go through the metal detector ?
and yet you waste your time harassing a little kid .
ma &apos;am , you seem to know an awful lot about
sneaking contraband on to a plane .
yeah , i &apos;m colombian .
have you ever been to japan ?
i would like to make a phone call .
ladies and gentlemen , preboarding for our flight to maui ...
will begin in the next few minutes .
luke , please stop spinning .
sorry .
now make the airport stop spinning .
we made it ! claire !
oh , my god . thank god you &apos;re here .
oh , honey !
i am so sorry .
it was my fault .
it wasn &apos;t your fault .
i should have known what you wanted .
are you drunk ?
kinda .
and once i spent a week in cancún ,
which , by the way , did not live up to the hype .
can somebody tell me what the hell is going on ?
we &apos;re almost done here , sir .
so you and your son are traveling together ?
yes .
then why are you departing maui on different dates ?
well , because he &apos;s traveling back home with his family .
what ?
surprise !
they &apos;re only staying for six days .
the rest of the time it &apos;s only you and me .
really ?
mm @-@ hmm . i wanted to spend some time alone with my husband-
drink cocktails by the pool , sleep in .
i could not love you any more than i do right now .
i also found a topless beach .
i was wrong .
mr. jackson , have a great flight .
it &apos;s to the left . oh , gorgeous !
oh , thank you . it &apos;s vintage .
think he meant lily .
you don &apos;t know that .
hey , there &apos;s another hottie for you at 5 : 00 .
i think he &apos;s an artist .
it &apos;s whale &quot; watching . &quot;
whale washing .
watching .
washing .
that &apos;s close enough .
have a good flight , sir .
quick , do your zombie impression .
she hasn &apos;t been drinking , has she ?
oh , no , no , no .
she &apos;s- she &apos;s hilarious . okay , let &apos;s do bride of frankenstein .
it &apos;s so , so good .
