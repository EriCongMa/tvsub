Hi.
Falling in love at the first sight.
Immediate attraction is pure narcissism.
Oh, I don't agree.
Look, they're talking about his t-shirt.
It takes quite a lot of effort to attract a mate.
That right there is the beginning of true love.
People are attracted to people who are attracted to them.
Well, there goes that theory.
Something tells me we're not getting in much of a run.
Rizzoli.
Isles.
Hey, Russ. What do we got?
Hey, Rizzoli. How you doing?
Got a floater.
When did you pull him out?
20 minutes ago.
How long's he been in?
Well, it's hard to tell
once the body's been in the water for over an hour.
Couldn't find an I.D.
We don't need an I.D.
Maura... You know him?
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.
It's Adam Fairfield.
I was, uh, I was involved with his brother Garrett.
Of the Fairfields?
Was it serious?
I was 20.
Everything felt serious.
Look at the back of his head.
Yeah, it's common with drowning victims.
Most likely from getting struck against the rocks.
You want to go with me when I notify the family?
No.
But I will.
I owe him that.
Holy crap.
Well...
The castle in Scotland is much bigger.
Place on the cape is beautiful, too.
You could've been a Fairfield.
How do we not know this?
Could you stop saying that?
Whoo-whoo!
This is a Spyker!
C8 Laviolette.
That's 400 horses up under there.
I've only seen these in magazines.
Garrett's here. He's always liked the finer things in life.
Yeah. He liked you.
I should have known.
Somebody like the mayor beat us to it.
Nothing happens in Boston
without the brahmin families knowing about it.
Right. Brahmins.
Upper...Crust.
Is that the manifest from the Mayflower?
Look -- Balthazar Fairfield.
Is that him?
Made his money like all the first families.
Right, from shipping?
Yeah -- rum, wine, slaves.
They don't seem to remember that part of their history.
The brahmins have been Boston's social elite for centuries.
They live conservatively.
It would be considered declassic to flaunt your wealth.
This isn't flaunting?
Well, considering that they're billionaires, no.
Sumner.
Maura.
I'm so sorry.
I hear you're running the medical examiner's office now.
This is, uh, Jocelyn, Adam's wife.
I'm so sorry about Adam.
At least he was doing what he loved.
Uh, what was that?
Sailing.
I-I can't believe he drowned.
We can't be sure that's what happened.
We're gonna need a description of the boat.
I think we should notify the boston harbor and the coast guard.
Who are you?
Jane, can this wait?
No.
I'm detective Rizzoli.
This is Detective Frost, Boston Homicide.
Homicide? Why?
We look into all unattended deaths.
When was the last time you saw your husband?
They're just being thorough.
Last night.
He left very early.
Do you know if he was wearing a life jacket?
Never.
He said he could sail before he could ride a bike.
Maura.
Garrett.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you for coming.
Detectives...
I'm Robert Colburn,
legal counsel for the Fairfield estate.
Thank you for coming so quickly.
Of course.
The family would like to cooperate in any way they can.
Get me any questions you have in writing,
and I will respond to them in 24 hours.
That's not really how we operate.
Well, I'm sure you can understand that the family is --
Excuse me.
I flew in for the foundation gala.
I can't believe it's gonna be a memorial now.
Maura. This must be Garrett.
I'm sorry, Mr. Fairfield.
I was explaining to the detectives --
That it's critical we get statements as quickly as possible.
Isn't that right, Maura?
Well, I'm sure the family will be more than happy
to answer all of your questions as soon as they're ready.
I don't even have a cause of death.
We should just give them their space.
Space? How much space do they need?
Yeah, maybe we can, uh,
set up some interviews over the next few days.
Oh, hey! Do you not get it?
They're not setting up interviews.
Quit looking at the car!
Whoa, hey, whoa. That's not a car.
That's a work of art.
Yeah, you're a tool.
Do you get tired in the afternoon?
Forget where your keys are, your phone?
Well, Polynesian people
are among the healthiest and happiest people on the planet.
Now science knows why.
And it comes in a bottle.
How long has this been going on?
A while.
I got the two-bottle special.
Your mother's really a good saleswoman.
If you buy now, I'm offering a two-for-one special.
It's an excellent value.
And if you sign up for a year,
it's -- it's less than a daily cappuccino.
Come here, ma. Come on.
Excuse me one second. My son.
What?
What are you doing?
I'm the authorized sales associate
for the Polynesian anti-aging lychee fruit flush.
Did you know that
Polynesians were among the healthiest --
Since when are you doing this?
Since it single-handedly cured Carla Talucci's colitis.
Carla Talucci?
Yeah.
The only woman in the neighborhood
who actually fell for the Nigerian Bank Scam?
Take a bottle on me.
Take it three times a day with meals.
It'll change your life.
Do you have to do this here, ma?
The people here will be astonished
at the change in their lives --
Digestion, bowel movements --
Ma!
What?
Just bring this to Jane.
Maybe it will help both of you with your irritability.
The body of Adam Fairfield was found
floating early this morning in Boston Harbor.
Now, Fairfield was only 42 years old,
but he was the head of the Fairfield Empire,
a collection of Boston-based corporations,
financial institutions, philanthropic groups,
things like that.
He was also, though, a member of one of the oldest, most...
Why are you doing the autopsy on a Sunday?
Did they cancel
all the kundalini-pulao-riku yoga classes?
Kundalini is sacred energy work,
pulao is a savory rice dish,
and I'm pretty sure that you made up that last word.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not as educated as you
and your deluxe friends.
Thanks for the support with them, by the way.
Their brother just died.
I'm sorry I couldn't stand there
and just let you badger his family.
Badger?
Is that how you describe how I do my job?
And since when do you rush the science?
I'm not rushing anything.
You're scrambling to finish out the autopsy.
The governor called.
He would like the reports right away.
Of course he did. Did you have a nice chat?
Maybe tonight you could attend the opera with some senators,
and then afterwards go out on the veranda
and smoke big rolled-up wads of $100s.
These people are not the enemy.
Yeah, neither was Columbus.
Tell that to the Native Americans he killed with smallpox.
The Fairfields helped build this city.
My grandfather was an ironworker.
He helped build this city.
Okay, so -- so what are we arguing about here,
history or are you just mad at me for who my friends are?
This is about work. Okay?
I-I've just never seen you hugging suspects before.
We don't even know what happened here.
If this was an accidental drowning,
there are no suspects.
So you're hoping it's an accident.
Are you hoping it was a murder?
I'm doing my job like I always do.
Why don't you do yours?
I am.
And as a medical examiner,
it is my job to determine the cause and the manner of death,
so I'll tell you whether there's a case here or not.
Maybe I'll just figure it out for myself.
This is great.
What?
Our suspects.
Never seen so many rich, white faces.
It's "Clue" --
Jocelyn Fairfield in the parlor with a knife.
Their money goes back to Plymouth Rock.
据传1620年移民到美洲的清教徒由此处登岸
Oh, they made plenty of enemies in the last four centuries.
Check this out.
The tabloids say Adam Fairfield's marriage
was on the rocks.
What about his brothers, Sumner and Garrett?
The victim was the oldest brother.
You know, Dr. Isles dated the middle brother.
No kidding.
Makes sense, I guess.
These people think they're royalty.
But look, even though Adam was the oldest,
Sumner, the youngest, took over the family firm.
Maybe Adam was a screwup.
Not for long.
He took over the business five years ago.
What about Garrett, the middle brother?
He owns a successful clothing company in Milan.
Look at this --
fraud allegations against Sumner.
That's why Adam took over.
"Sumner Fairfield now finds fulfillment
with hands-on work at a food pantry."
No one comfortable in a mansion the size of my neighborhood
chooses to do hands-on work of any kind.
Let's go talk to him.
When'd you last talk to harbor patrol?
Two minutes ago. You were right here listening.
You tell them to find Adam's boat?
No, I left that part out.
I ran the company for six years
while Adam partied and raced yachts.
Story is he came back and took over
because of fraud allegations?
You really don't know how the game is played, do you?
No, I never played the entitlement game.
I played the South Boston game,
on asphalt with broken bottles, used needles.
Educate me.
Adam got sick of clubbing,
so I gave him a job.
Next thing I know, the board's accusing me of fraud,
and he's C.E.O.
Why didn't the business go to him in the first place?
I mean, he was the oldest.
He and my dad fought a lot.
He waited until dad was dead before...
Before what? Setting you up?
Yeah, he set me up. Guys, Tim!
No, these go to the Westerville pantry!
How bad did you want to even things up?
Fairfields will do a lot of things to each other, detective,
but brothers don't kill brothers.
Yeah.
Where were you Saturday afternoon?
Motorcycle ride. Beacon Hill to New Bedford.
Beautiful day.
You guys want to see the gas receipts?
Anyone go with you?
No. I ride alone.
Come on -- Westerville pantry.
Wrong palette!
You guys are way off. It wasn't me.
Adam was an experienced sailor.
so he didn't just fall off the boat.
Well, what do you think?
Tom!
I think I'd like to see a picture of Sumner on his bike.
Cashmere.
What will this set me back, couple hundred?
Well, those are from Garrett's line.
The sweaters start around, oh, $1,000.
What's it made of, spun platinum?
The downy undercoat of cashmere goats.
This texture should be softer.
Must be from the sea-salt exposure.
Or maybe the goat was getting even.
That depression on the bone, what's that from?
Oh, it's hard to tell.
Maybe the victim fell
and hit his head on the edge of the boat.
Hey, doc --
you want to tell me
why I'm really here on Jane's case?
Oh, well, I-I thought I could get the benefit
of your sailing experience.
I got a little sunfish I throw in the back of the truck
and take out to the cape.
Well, you know, it -- it seems like the victim, you know,
hit his head on the boat, maybe slipped, fell overboard.
W-what's your take?
My take is that you are the chief medical examiner,
and this is not your first floater.
It -- it is my, uh, my 43rd.
Yes, my -- my 43rd.
I've been a cop a long time.
I know when people aren't telling me the whole story.
Jane's mad at me.
Oh, boy.
She thinks I'm being biased
because I'm acquainted with the family.
"Acquainted"?
I heard it was a little more than that.
It was.
That's not it, though.
When you grew up like jane,
you're gonna have an attitude about people who,
uh, who are entitled.
That's a form of prejudice.
Where people like me and Jane come from,
we didn't have a lot.
But we had each other's backs.
Sounds to me like all Jane wants to know is,
do you have hers or not?
Hey. So ma's got a new job.
Selling that.
Carla Talucci?
Can you have the crime lab run a test on it?
I just want to make sure she's not gonna kill anybody.
Yeah, sure.
What's up?
Ma's wearing lipstick every day.
She just bought some new clothes.
Big new job hawking anti-aging potion.
It makes sense.
What if there's more to it than that?
I mean, maybe she's thinking about leaving dad.
Detective Rizzoli.
All right, I'll see ya.
Mr. Colburn...
we subpoenaed a lot of records from the estate.
I don't see you carrying any files.
There are sensitive international finances involved.
We can't have those documents floating around.
So the Fairfields are above the law?
Not at all.
We're giving our complete cooperation.
Yeah, I can see that.
Look, I'm not fooled by your $5,000 suit.
I ran your background. I know where you come from.
St. Luke's parish. That's a tough neighborhood.
Well, I've come a long way from there.
Maybe too far
when you're blindly protecting rich bosses.
My father collected trash.
I'd be doing the same
if it wasn't for the Fairfields.
Their foundation put me through college and law school.
They gave me a job, they let me rise to where I am now --
What, they "let" you?
I have assurances from the top authorities in the state
that this matter will be handled swiftly and discreetly.
You got that?
I will handle this case the way I handle all my cases.
You seem like a bright young woman with a promising future.
I'd hate to see your career path cut short.
I had B.R.I.C detectives go through
27 hours of security footage on Sumner's bike route.
Let me guess -- no sign of him or his motorcycle.
Nope. Nothing.
Jane's getting stonewalled by Colburn.
Can't get near the wife.
No idea if the wife even has an alibi or not.
Can't talk to Garrett, either.
He flew in from Los Angeles by private jet sunday morning.
After the murder.
Preliminary autopsy report.
Why give that to us instead of Jane?
Don't go there.
There's evidence of blunt-force trauma,
which could have happened when he fell off the boat.
Pulmonary edema from drowning.
His stomach contents were "unusually well-preserved."
It's odd because I was able to determine
that he had belon oysters at his last meal.
Belon oysters?
They're supposed to be amazing.
What are you, a friggin' foodie now?
Well, they are prized
for their unique tannic seawater flavor.
I read about them in the weekly.
Only a couple restaurants in town serve them.
Maybe we can figure out where he ate lunch.
Any restaurant near a harbor?
Maison de la mer. Nahant.
Hey, I like oysters.
They fry them, right?
What? No, no, no.
They serve them raw on the half shell.
Come with us.
I will. Thank you.
Belon oysters served raw with a touch of natural sea salt,
and the chef recommends you not chew them.
Food you can't chew. And you pay for that?
Have you seen this guy in here recently?
I can't say that I have.
Lot of that going around.
Damn, that's good.
Dry, metallic. Delicious.
You can't look at a dead body,
but you could slurp that snot down?
That's what it is, you know -- oyster snot.
Whoa. Receipt from a corporate card --
Sullivan control systems.
It's a Fairfield subsidiary.
"John Hancock." That's hardly creative.
Hey, pal, can you pull the order off this receipt?
Sure you're not gonna eat that?
More for me.
Glass of Chateau De Beaucastel sirah,
Mount Eden chardonnay, nicoise salad, D.O.S.
Dressing on the side.
It's chick food.
No, no, no. Y-you're accurate.
I do prefer my dressing on the side.
May be a guy watching his cholesterol.
Over fine wine at a romantic, seaside restaurant?
Maybe he loves his wife.
Uh, Jocelyn said she didn't see him that day.
So who did?
It's got 24-karat gold flakes in it.
Are you making fun of me?
No! I thought it would be fun to try.
Will you run some tests on this please?
What case?
Is Jane's mother poisoning the neighborhood?
Sure.
So, you gonna try the chocolate?
What are you so dressed up for?
No reason.
Is this an apology?
For what?
Oh, boy.
You ask her.
Jane thought maybe Garrett would tell you the name of the woman
his brother had lunch with before he died.
So this is a bribe.
Tell Jane that if she thinks that chocolate will induce me
to use my personal relationship with Garrett Fairfield,
she doesn't know me very well.
Tell Maura that I didn't realize
I needed to bribe her with the hope diamond...
My phone.
to ge--
I got to take this.
Korsak.
You looked really at home in that world.
It's where I'm from. It's not where I chose to stay.
Well, what are you doing down here slumming with us?
The same as you!
I'm catching bad guys.
I need the job. You don't.
Look, I want my life to have meaning and purpose,
the same as you.
Sounds good, Maura.
I-I don't know what to believe anymore.
I'm not even sure whose side you're on.
Your form still looks good.
So does yours.
You still running marathons?
Once a year.
I don't really have time for more. Work's pretty busy.
Is that why you're here?
Please tell me you didn't learn how to lie.
That was one of your most endearing traits.
The investigators think that your brother
had lunch with a woman before he died.
They were hoping you might know who.
There's a reason I based my clothing company out of Milan.
I think I know why.
We used to talk a lot, remember?
It might've just been talk if it wasn't for you.
You inspired me to take a risk,
go out on my own, get away from the clutches of my family.
And you did it. You got out.
Sumner and Adam, they fought a lot.
So what are you saying, that -- that Sumner
had something to do with Adam's death?
No.
Fairfields will do a lot of things to each other,
but...brothers don't kill brothers.
You're not married, are you?
No.
I have to come back to boston and run the business.
I can't leave it to Sumner.
He's a mess.
Do you know who Adam was seeing?
Would you tell me if I promise to be discreet?
There hasn't been anyone serious for a long time.
How long?
College.
Rizzoli.
Jane.
Maura, I'm sorry.
It's okay. Listen, I don't have a lot of time.
Adam had a mistress. Vanessa Dewald.
Why -- why are you doing this?
Because I have your back.
I gotta go.
Thanks.
Miss me?
Yeah.
Rizzoli just called. Nicoise-salad eater has a name.
Vanessa Dewald.
Adam Fairfield's mistress?
Rizzoli tracked her down, talked to her.
Her alibi checks out, but she had this interesting tidbit --
Adam was divorcing his wife.
Rich guys have prenups.
Jocelyn stood to lose hundreds of millions of dollars
if Adam divorced her.
That's hundreds of millions of motives.
Korsak.
Great. On our way.
Harbor Patrol found the boat.
I'll call Jane.
Excuse us, gentlemen.
Boat was found in our waters.
It's a federal investigation now.
It's -- it's a nice ventriloquism act.
Yeah, I can barely see your lips moving.
Our tow boat's on the way to take this craft to our slip.
That craft is our crime scene.
It's our jurisdiction. Move.
You want kids?
I would move.
All right. You win.
Blood on the boom.
Hit his head, he got disoriented, fell overboard.
It's an accident.
I got his wallet
and some sort of inhaler.
He had asthma.
Furling rig, twin helms, graceful shear,
teak-capped rail, french --
she's a beaut.
Man, you need to get some.
This from a man who makes love to an oyster?
Jane, I did a once-around the hull --
no scrapes, no fender marks.
Nothing docked with her at sea.
Man, I'm cool, all right?
I can admit when I'm wrong. Call it an accident.
I wish I could.
But it wasn't an accident.
Adam Fairfield was murdered.
The mikrosil casting came back.
We got a partial impression of the object
that struck Adam Fairfield's skull.
It wasn't the boat's boom?
There's nothing on that boat
that matches the impressions left on Adam's skull.
So somebody planted the blood on the boom.
That's the only explanation I can come up with.
So, the killer hides on Adam's boat,
he waits until Adam is out to sea,
hits him over the head with a weapon
and then throws the weapon and the body overboard.
Yeah, but how does he or she get back to shore?
Maybe a boat or a dinghy.
Korsak said there was nothing docked against the boat.
Then there's an accomplice on another boat nearby.
It's a pretty perfect murder.
Except that the imprints of the skull would match the weapon.
Which is 20,000 leagues under the sea.
Oh, that's actually a reference to unit of distance.
Leagues across the ocean, not depth.
It's at the bottom of the ocean.
Do you have a plan of finding it?
Not a good one.
What?
There's just something about these fibers
on Adam's cashmere sweater.
I'm gonna have the lab take another look at it.
You want to get a drink?
Will it have gold flecks in it?
No.
The cabernet here is chalky.
Have a beer. It's cold.
I don't drink beer.
Right.
Well, we know for a fact that it's a murder,
and we have two solid suspects with motive --
The wife, 'cause she didn't want a divorce,
and Sumner, because he's pissed at Adam for pushing him out.
And Colburn, who won't let you near them.
Please don't talk to me about that guy.
Ok, fine.
You want to tell me what happened with Garrett?
There's not much to tell.
I loved that guy.
You know when you're so in love,
you feel like you took some kind of a substance?
Oh, that's just narcissism.
Maybe.
By the way, I, uh, I ran some tests
on your mother's miracle juice.
It's 98% water.
The rest is sodium citrate, monopotassium phosphate.
Anything harmful?
No.
But there's nothing helpful, either.
I should tell Frankie.
Oh, I brought you a -- a present.
Apology or bribe?
"The Fairfield family invite you and a guest to a memorial."
Uh, Maura, this is tonight.
Yeah, I wasn't gonna go.
But you wanted access to my deluxe frineds,
Sumner and Jocelyn.
I want you to be my guest.
Won't I embarrass you?
Probably. But haven't I embarrassed you?
No...
more than half a dozen times.
"Cocktail dress required."
Can't I just go like this?
If you're going to embarrass me,
at least do it in the proper clothes.
Come on.
I have most of my money tied up in charitable endowments,
but not all.
I feel like I'm at my junior prom.
What?
Okay, I think I'm getting a wedgie.
Cover me.
Oh, god.
Can't you do this in the bathroom?
No, it'll just take a second.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks.
That is good.
LeFevre Brut.
Can't get that at 7-eleven, can you?
Man. How much?
How much? I don't know.
Guess.
No.
100 bucks?
Maybe. I-I don't know.
100 bucks a bottle? Wow.
A glass.
Really? God, no wonder it's so good.
My mother would be trying to smuggle it home in her purse.
Can you hold this?
Thank you.
Oh, the results came back for the fibers on Adam's sweater.
Do you mind if I just send this to Frost to check it out?
No. Go ahead.
Maura.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
You remember my friend, Jane Rizzoli.
Of course.
Hello.
You're both absolutely breathtaking.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Usually, this would be a celebration,
a big gala to raise money for Boston charities.
Tonight, it's for Adam.
I guess it falls on me to commission a painting of him.
And the trophy we won when we were 8 and 10.
We used to trade it back and forth.
I brought it home for him.
It's a lovely gesture.
Excuse me.
Of course.
Give me that.
Give it to me.
I am hungry.
Branzino with a meuniere reduction.
Ugh, it -- it's looking at me
like I personally put the hook in.
How am I supposed to eat that?
Use your fish knife.
It's next to the melon spoon.
Second from the right.
Hold it like a pencil.
Okay?
Use the tip to cut the backbone.
Then you cut the tail,
and you place it on the side of the plate.
Use this edge of the knife to remove the skin,
and place it at the head of the plate.
There we go.
Okay?
Okay, uh, this is how we do it in my family.
It's okay. Just eat it.
It's delicious.
Why do they serve beef wellington after fish?
And why does everything have to be so juicy?
That's interesting.
That explains why their alibis don't check out.
Because they were probably with each other.
Killing Adam Fairfield.
Detective. A moment.
Right after I talk to your two pals
about killing Adam Fairfield.
Please.
Now, you've wondered what I've been covering up?
Well, now you know. They're having an affair.
No kidding.
But I know for a fact that they didn't kill Adam Fairfield.
Oh, what do you got? We love facts.
While Adam was sailing, they were in a suite at the ritz.
All afternoon.
So we just went from two suspects to none.
Actually...
I think we may have a new one.
I looked into that fiber for you.
Good cashmere is 14 microns thick.
This is 24.
Subpar materials.
W-why would Garrett be using cheap cashmere?
Because he's broke.
I called his suppliers.
He's behind on everything --
uh, materials, warehousing, manufacturing, packaging.
The guy hasn't paid a bill in months.
Okay, that makes no sense. He inherited a fortune.
Looks like he burned through it all and then some.
Okay, just because his company's in trouble
doesn't mean that he's a killer.
I don't know.
Maybe killing off your brother
and inheriting the family empire,
paying off your debt, turns you into one.
But he flew in after the murder.
Flew in from Milan.
Frost, uh,
we can't get into that private jet manifest, can we?
No, we can only track the plane.
Looks like it stopped in L.A. to refuel.
Got stuck there for three days. Engine trouble.
And he and the plane arrived in Boston after the murder.
Can we prove he was on that plane?
Takes, what, three days to drive from L.A. to Boston?
Oh. You think he did it in the spyker?
Maura, I'm sorry.
You okay?
I should've seen it.
You did.
There is a reason that you didn't commit to him after college.
There is a reason that you're holding back now.
It's called gut instinct.
But there were clues, and I --
I couldn't put them together.
You did.
You did it subconsciously.
The oysters. That's how I missed it.
The oysters, and it was right in front of me the whole time.
Okay, come on.
I-I'll take it from here, okay?
Look, I-I thought that Adam had asthma.
But he was taking a drug to treat panlobular emphysema,
which is why he couldn't digest food.
He wasn't a smoker.
That is great for him.
The damage was caused by a disorder
called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
S-sweetie, I-I'm sorry.
I-I don't know why you're telling me this.
It's inherited.
The illness that Adam had,
all of the Fairfield children should have, but they don't.
Because Adam had a different father.
And that's who carried the fatal gene.
Adam was a half-brother.
So that's why he didn't inherit the family business.
Because he wasn't part of the bloodline.
He wasn't a brahmin.
Wait -- why didn't the father give it to Garrett?
He was next in line.
Because they had a terrible relationship.
Garrett always used to say
that he wanted to make his own way in the world.
And I'm not sure he had a choice.
And then that didn't work because he was going bankrupt.
Garrett said that brothers don't kill brothers.
I think he justified what he did
