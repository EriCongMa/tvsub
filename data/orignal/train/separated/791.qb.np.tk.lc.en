oh , snap snap , oh , snap snap .
woo , that sounds pretty good .
thank you .
listen , schmidt ,
i &apos;ve been kind of stuck on this whole career search thing .
you think i &apos;d begin the advertising ?
i mean that &apos;s what you do right ?
advertising is a dog drinking beer ,
a fat moron falling down the stairs .
a snot @-@ nosed brat
kicking his rapping grandpa in the testicles .
rapping grandpa ,
it kills me though .
i &apos;m in marketing , winston ,
the back bone of capitalism
without you be dead in two days .
i could be good at that .
probably not ,
but you can shadow me at work today to find out .
yeah ! team drug store back from mission drug store , right , coach ?
yeah . uh , can i have my bag ?
yeah . good stuff . good stuff .
thanks .
so , same time next week , right ? team drug store ?
we &apos;ll go again to the drug store ?
team drug store ?
ugh ! god ! what a walnut !
it &apos;s been two months we &apos;ve been living with him ,
and i have yet to crack him .
it &apos;s like we just spent an hour together .
it was , like , nothing , no connection .
and don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s in my mind , because it &apos;s not .
we ran into one of his friends ,
and coach said the meanest thing about me .
check these out .
can you believe these are for glaucoma ?
she &apos;s my buddy &apos;s girlfriend .
you are my girlfriend . what &apos;s the big deal ?
i want him to think of me as his friend .
oh , i hear that .
well , it &apos;ll happen if it &apos;s meant to .
i need to find a way in .
i found a way to force myself into all of your lives .
you just didn &apos;t know it .
food , clothes , onesie pajamas .
i like the butt flap .
you really think mine was food ?
i can think of five other reasons i wanted to be your friend .
boob , boob , vagina , butt cheek , butt cheek .
in that order ?
well , i &apos;m not gonna say ,
&quot; vagina , butt cheek , boob , butt cheek , boob . &quot;
yeah , but that &apos;s the correct ...
that &apos;s the order , yeah .
look , nick , i need help .
like , tell me about coach . like , what &apos;s up with him ?
what does he like ? what does he dislike ?
well , coach 101 is , he &apos;s watching basketball .
and that &apos;s all he &apos;s gonna do from october till june .
his team &apos;s the pistons .
i mean , they were great in the &apos; 80s ,
but then we got jordan .
then they started getting good .
then we got thibodeau .
what you gonna do now ? and he knows that .
that &apos;s genius . basketball . that &apos;s my way in .
basketball &apos;s not your in . you don &apos;t know anything about basketball .
come on .
you refer to it as &quot; basketsball . &quot;
well , that &apos;s the technically @-@ correct term , nick .
there are two baskets .
i &apos;m an english teacher .
basketball &apos;s just the first step .
we sit down , we watch a game .
we have a few laughs .
before you know it ,
we &apos;ll be digging into each other &apos;s pasts .
that &apos;s not how it works , though .
childhoods , nick .
that &apos;s the friendship money shot .
men watch sports so we don &apos;t have to talk about childhood stuff .
no .
it &apos;s a real thing .
and the game doesn &apos;t even have deeper meaning .
come on .
and there &apos;s no layers to it .
if i &apos;m talking about a player overcoming the defense to win ,
that &apos;s not like i &apos;m overcoming it .
no . come on .
not only that . he &apos;s a pistons fan , and i &apos;m a bulls fan .
right . i don &apos;t understand , no .
it &apos;s rivalries .
sharks and cats .
yankees , red sox .
whales and dolphins .
pistons fan , bulls fan . end of discussion .
i get it . jean valjean and javert .
yeah , definitely .
this is like a jean vanjer and vajer situation .
so , where do you do the marketing ?
oh , winston , so sweet , so naive .
where do we do the marketing ?
we do the marketing everywhere .
now , you &apos;re gonna want to take notes on everything i do ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re about to see life happen at the speed of business .
schmidt . i have a task for you .
hi , kim .
we got a new guy , and i want you to show him around .
wait . who &apos;s this ?
oh , i &apos;m just shadowing schmidt .
called my bluff . don &apos;t care .
ed ?
come meet schmidt .
okey @-@ dokey .
that &apos;s the new guy ?
new compared to what , the moon ?
here &apos;s what happened .
gwen turned 45 , so we had to fire her .
obviously . so , wait .
gwen &apos;s job is available ?
yeah , but then grandma turned around
and filed an ageism lawsuit ,
so we hired bran flakes here to cover our ass .
just do it .
all right , i &apos;ll do it .
well , here i am .
okay .
i &apos;m schmidt . i guess they wanted you to learn from the best .
well , actually , they said your office was closest to the can .
i got a prostate the size of an avacado .
&quot; closest to the can . &quot;
do not write that down , winston !
is it not closest to the can ?
yes !
i stay sealed off during basketball season .
plus , i , uh , dropped some olives under the bed , can &apos;t reach &apos; em .
oh . i got little pinchers .
hey , so ...
i was gonna watch the , uh , pistons of detroit game .
don &apos;t really have the reach for that .
good thing i got legs .
wait . you like the pistons ?
oh , yeah . just like you .
are you serious ? !
yeah , i &apos;m dead serious .
so , you in ?
be cool to watch it on a big tv .
i found your olives .
oh , you did ?
thought they were gonna be in a jar .
no .
this is a big part of the biz , my man .
networking , face time , making deals .
normally , this would have a much sexier , businessman &apos;s vibe .
but not when i &apos;m dragging around this old drooling potato .
potata ? yeah , i can split a baked potata .
what a life you must have lead .
tell us about the street car , will you ?
oh , it was a dynamite way to get around .
pasadena to to the beach ...
i &apos;ll take another one of these .
sure .
you know , cece , i can &apos;t help but think
that i am just following another bad lead with this marketing thing .
all i &apos;m doing is taking a bunch of notes for schmidt .
what &apos;s this ? &quot; seems befuddled and totally lucid ,
smells too clean &quot; ?
those were just notes about ed .
i &apos;ll tell you what . that dude is way more interesting than marketing .
if i &apos;m gonna take gwen &apos;s job
and become the next cio of ass @-@ strat ,
i can &apos;t just embrace modernization .
i got to make babies with it . do you know what i mean ?
it &apos;s time to unveil my baby .
micro @-@ marketing .
yeah , we target our messages directly
to the individual consumer .
what a good idea .
they &apos;re gonna hold a ticker @-@ tape parade for you
in the jewish part of town .
that &apos;s right . in the jewish part of town .
nothing but net .
traditionally , &quot; nothing but net &quot;
refers to hitting nothing but inside of the net .
oh ?
ah , so .
yeah , no .
oh , time @-@ out .
butt bump .
what ?
i &apos;m ready .
what ? the butt ... ? oh .
come on .
all right .
hey ! hey ! what is that ?
it &apos;s the pistons butt bump .
i didn &apos;t know your girlfriend was a pistons fan .
that &apos;s got to suck for you , man .
but i guess everything sucks for you
when you root for the bulls .
butt bump !
oh , cool , cool , cool . so you &apos;re a pistons fan now , jess ?
suck it , bulls !
yeah . suck it , bulls !
the worst team in the league , the bulls .
oh , it &apos;s the worst team in the league , all right .
who is the worst team in the league , jess ?
the bulls .
the bulls are the worst team in the league .
so , went really well today .
i think coach and i are really connecting .
come on , what is that ?
what do you mean ?
what ? oh , coach gave this to me .
how cute is this shirt ?
don &apos;t take this the wrong way , but i &apos;m gonna
need you to get out of my bed .
why ? because of the shirt ?
100 % because of the shirt .
oh , my god , you &apos;re serious .
i can &apos;t have you in my bed in a pistons shirt .
oh , my god !
i need you to get out of the bed .
jess , i need you to get out of there .
i tried being cool about it , but it &apos;s not cool .
really ?
really .
nick , it &apos;s just basketball .
why are you taking this personally ?
because it &apos;s personal , jess !
that &apos;s my team .
it &apos;s the city that i &apos;m from .
it &apos;s most of my relationship with my dad .
r.i.p. , by the way .
michael jordan .
the first man that taught me that i could love a man .
and the pistons are our rivals .
they &apos;re like in hamlet--
the mccalls and the ... hacksperes .
you &apos;re my girlfriend now ,
so ... you got to be a bulls fan .
that &apos;s the whole point , nick .
coach just thinks of me as your girlfriend ,
and i want him to know me for me .
do you want me to be friends with coach ?
i @-@ i absolutely do . yes .
so , then , why can &apos;t i be a pistons fan
until we become friends ,
and then i &apos;ll switch to the bulls ?
so every year you can just pick a new team ?
you meet a new friend , you &apos;re a fan of that ?
i could never trust you .
can we just have sex now , please ?
i &apos;m sorry . you can &apos;t be a pistons fan . i forbid it .
it has to be this way .
you can &apos;t forbid me to do stuff .
that &apos;s just not ... you ...
that &apos;s not within your power .
i just did .
the shirt stays !
jessica , you &apos;re leaving me no options here .
i &apos;m gonna have to turn off the tap .
what tap ?
the sex tap .
but i need my vitamin d.
as long as you &apos;re wearing that shirt , the tap is off .
no more ... hot water .
all right , fine , then .
my shirt and i will go sleep in my bed .
oh . what happened to your pistons jersey ?
did you rip it off and rush in here
&apos;cause she got to have it ?
look , is this still a thing ?
oh , it &apos;s still a thing .
no sex for you as long as you &apos;re a pistons fan .
you can &apos;t use sex to manipulate ...
what are you doing ?
just brushing my dirty teeth .
they &apos;re filthy .
nick , do not challenge me to a sex standoff .
i can channel all my sexual energy into knitting .
how do you think i made it through high school ?
it &apos;s good when you go fast and then slow .
make the teeth wait for it .
you &apos;re on .
turnover ! dunk it from the downtown !
go ! go ! go !
pass that pumpkin to josh smith .
you better listen to my friend .
she knows exactly what she &apos;s talking about !
did you just call me your friend ?
what &apos;s up , guys ?
ah , two minutes in , and the pistons are already down by ten .
what a drag .
what the heck are you wearing , dude ?
just my scottie pippens . yeah .
oh , hey , i &apos;m just checking up on you . you frustrated at all ?
you need your ... vitamin d ?
no .
jessica ...
three @-@ point play ! yes !
oh , yeah !
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about !
we are talking about the same thing ,
my friend and i.
do my berries make you hungry ?
mmm . refreshing .
just drink the water , nick .
you &apos;re turning yourself on now .
i really am , yeah .
okay , next order of business is ...
kim , if i may , uh , present an idea very quickly to the group .
while i know ...
micro @-@ marketing .
what ?
has this company ever considered
targeting its message to individual consumers ?
big data &apos;s knocking . let &apos;s open the door .
just a thought .
yeah , interesting . ed , look into that
and present it to the board asap .
great job . i &apos;d hug you ,
but you smell like a public library .
what are you doing ?
i may be dirty , but i play old .
you said that wrong .
and yet i got my paw wrapped around your avacadas .
what is with you and avacadas ?
sorry .
you &apos;re never gonna believe what ed just did .
he stabbed you in the back .
winston , that &apos;s exactly what happened . how did you do that ?
i figured him out , schmidt .
that liver spot out @-@ sharked me . can you believe that ?
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m a minnow .
tomorrow , ed is gonna present my idea to the board ,
and then he &apos;s gonna get the ... get the promotion .
my career is toast . minnow toast .
yeah , well , i tip my hat to him .
the minnow tips his tiny hat to the shark ,
and then lays down on the toast to be eaten .
there is too much going on in whatever metaphor you &apos;re trying .
okay ? it &apos;s too busy .
somewhat made se ... oh , forget it .
ed wins . i &apos;m a mess .
hell , no , schmidt .
justice has to be served , all right ?
mm @-@ hmm . right . let us stop ed .
the minnow needs to get up off of ...
no , off of the toast mat
and fish @-@ fight his way to the orangutan ball .
i just don &apos;t understand why they keep giving these games away !
you know what it was ?
it was that turnover in the third quarter .
right .
yeah . i &apos;ll show you .
i can just take your word for it .
actually , let &apos;s do it from the beginning .
you want to watch the game we just watched all over again ?
with both overtimes ?
great .
looking for somebody ?
just doing a bed check .
and you are accounted for , so ...
see you .
so , how &apos;s it going ?
you guys bonding over basketball , jess ?
we &apos;re actually this close to moving past basketball
and into real friendship , so ...
great .
i &apos;m feeling pretty good about it .
after the pistons lost ,
did he get really sad and talk to you about it ?
about how he felt
and you guys became besties after ?
or did that not happen
because that &apos;s not the way men are ?
the pistons lost ,
so you must be feeling pretty good .
oh , i &apos;m happy , yeah .
yeah ?
you &apos;re feeling excited ?
worked up ?
yeah .
ready to cave ?
oh , i &apos;ve never been stronger .
oh , yeah ?
so if i just read you a description of ,
like , what a piston does , you know ,
on my phone , it wouldn &apos;t affect you at all ?
is that what you &apos;re saying ?
it &apos;s just a rod
that transfers ,
uh , force
from the crank shaft ...
what is this , a seduction class
for kindergarteners ?
watch the master work .
how about this ?
a little paula abdul stuff .
are we doing this ?
what are you doing ?
ball &apos;s in my court now , pal .
i &apos;m turning off my tap
until you become a pistons fan .
hey , that wasn &apos;t part of the deal .
it is now .
i can &apos;t figure out my counterstrike , winston .
the only thing we know about ed is that he &apos;s old and cranky ,
and he baffles me because i &apos;m so darn young and pleasant .
we just got to get inside into his old , cranky mind .
we have to find an older , crankier mind .
how are we gonna find an older , crankier mind than ed ?
hey , where are you guys getting your photos developed these days ?
i got these beefcake selfies
that i want to dangle in front of jess ,
get her engine revved up .
your phone has a camera , nick .
these are sexy , sensual , private pics .
i don &apos;t want them beamed right into snowden &apos;s pocket .
i &apos;m not going through wikileaks , man .
it &apos;s not for me .
anolog , it &apos;s the only thing you can trust .
you care to elaborate ,
you know , on this whole analog thing ?
no , here &apos;s the reality , you never know
what &apos;s gonna happen with a phone .
right .
the hinges that hold the flip together .
flip .
they get loosened over time when @-@ when they get wet .
and then once you open it , it &apos;s easier for people
to go in there and see your passwords and ,
you know , see your codes .
once the screen breaks ,
your information &apos;s in the twitterverse , man .
and it &apos;s all out there
for everyone to see , all these little monkey elfs , all these kids .
that &apos;s all they do . get your information , man .
bottom line is you can &apos;t control your technology .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in japan with all those robots .
not for me , man .
that &apos;s why i trust a hard copy .
plain and simple .
hard copy , schmidt .
nice work .
thank you .
and , nick , you know , if you &apos;re gonna be taking boudoir shots ,
please consult me .
i know .
i have a series of poses
that many people , including myself ,
find very sexy .
all right .
okay , here &apos;s one that i call the half nelson .
yeah , i didn &apos;t do that .
this is called a guy fieri .
just taste the sauces .
yeah .
black licorice .
you &apos;re welcome .
schmidt &apos;s dead wrong .
oh , yeah ?
i got some real hot pics in here .
i don &apos;t care .
there &apos;s one of me as a sexy mayor ,
looking out the window , deciding the future of my city .
it &apos;s got to get her going .
daddy needs his cookie .
dude , just wear the damn pistons jersey .
oh my god . i &apos;ve got to end this .
what time is it ? !
game time !
yeah ! it &apos;s my favorite time .
other than ... medieval time .
all right .
what the ... ?
what the ... ?
let me see what &apos;s ...
wait , no , i &apos;ll do it .
no ! oh , my god , a mouse ...
rat or s ... uh , some creature .
i got to go watch it in my room .
wait , no , no , no . coach , coach , coach ,
look , since we can &apos;t watch the game ,
why don &apos;t we just have a nice , long chat over coffee ?
what ?
you know , just talk , hang out .
what ?
and then coffee turns
to dinner , and dinner turns to weekly dinner ,
and before you know it , i &apos;m best man at your beach wedding .
do we have to ?
we don &apos;t ... okay .
you start .
me ?
hey , you want to do this over food ?
yes ! yes !
no ! no , no , no , no !
no ! come on ! get your head out of your ass so you can see
where you &apos;re going , damn it !
okay .
what ?
i have to say it .
coach , i ...
i don &apos;t like basketball .
what ?
there &apos;s , like , no fun parts .
there &apos;s no themes .
men should not be wearing tank tops , ever .
why were you pretending to like basketball ?
&apos;cause i wanted to be friends with you .
dude , you &apos;re my buddy &apos;s girlfriend .
we &apos;re watching the game .
what &apos;s the problem , dude ?
what else do you want ?
no , you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m just , um ... i &apos;m just nick &apos;s girlfriend , so ...
enjoy the game . okay .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m just , um ...
jess ... where ...
jess !
ladies , you all look like a hundred bucks .
i hope someone &apos;s taking you out for oysters rockefeller tonight .
配以十八种食材制成的调料
now , before i begin ,
my little helper here will distribute some handouts
for your reference .
uh , you know what , ed ? i &apos;m really sorry .
company printers are on the fritz , so ...
little helper that i am ,
i decided to load everything up onto the laptop .
there you go .
well , i &apos;m sure there &apos;s a printer that works .
i &apos;ll just wait for the hard copies .
i broke all the printers .
i &apos;m gonna beat you with an orange in a sock .
besides , we &apos;re talking about technology , aren &apos;t we ?
be a little silly to talk about technology without using technology .
am i right , kim ?
use the technology , ed .
hup @-@ i @-@ dip @-@ i @-@ dip ...
my left arm .
my neck .
you got me this time , hebrew .
but i &apos;ll be back .
this is why the cutoff &apos;s at 45 , ladies .
jess ! you win !
i &apos;m all backed up !
i &apos;ve even been fantasizing about winston !
where is she , dude ?
don &apos;t do that laugh .
what are you wearing , dude ?
it &apos;s for sex .
you like the pistons .
why don &apos;t you shut up , coach ?
where &apos;s jess ?
what is up with that girl , dude ?
one minute we &apos;re watching the game , the next she &apos;s , like ,
calling me a jerk and storming out of the place .
she just wants to be your friend .
any idiot can see that .
we were being friends .
we were watching the game together .
it was an awesome game .
okay , maybe she wants more than that .
like what ?
you want to know a trick ?
absolutely .
this is how you get in with jess .
you know when you &apos;re driving in your car
and you have a random thought , like ...
&quot; i wonder if seals are friends . &quot;
yeah , or like ...
&quot; i really want to text right now ,
but there &apos;s a cop behind me . &quot;
that &apos;s not the one i mean .
&quot; why do t rex have little arms ? &quot;
don &apos;t finish . don &apos;t f ... i know you , don &apos;t ...
&quot; if they get an itch in their crotch , how do they scratch it ? &quot;
i mean more like sweet , kind of emotional stuff .
like , if you combed , you know , like , a gorilla &apos;s hair , would it like it ?
like ... i &apos;ve never seen a baby pigeon before .
exactly !
tell that to her and you get a friend for life .
now , excuse me .
sex awaits .
hey , jess ! you win !
i want to take you !
respectfully !
come here . take that jersey off .
actually , leave it on .
to winston .
as a thank @-@ you , i &apos;d like ... i &apos;d like
to get you a job at ass @-@ strat .
i &apos;ll make you a real ass man .
i don &apos;t know , man .
i kind of liked the part where
we just get to analyze evidence , you know .
connect the dots a little bit , yeah .
live inside of someone else &apos;s mind .
spoken like a true marketing analyst .
i don &apos;t know .
you know , i kind of want to be free of a desk as well .
well ... roam the streets a little bit .
just sniff out clues . let me ask you something .
you guys get donuts in the morning ?
you ever thought of being a cop ?
winston , i think you &apos;d be great .
i can see it .
you know , it &apos;s funny .
i was thinking the exact same thing .
you &apos;ve already got high cholesterol
and weird people skills .
&quot; officer bishop . &quot;
i like the way that sounds .
it would be nice to retroactively justify that mustache .
it &apos;s a hell of a mustache .
what does that mean ? that was from a movie . you know ...
training day &apos;s my favorite movie .
i understand that ,
but you understand that &apos;s not what being a cop is .
i want to drop fools ! huh ? that &apos;s what you &apos;re telling me ?
i get to drop fools ?
if you think
this means you can start yelling at me ...
you damn right , sucker !
that &apos;s what that means .
oh , i apologize about that .
jess ?
jessica day @-@ hey @-@ ey .
i just want to say that , um ,
i would love to be your friend .
look , i know i &apos;m crazy about the pistons ,
but it &apos;s just because detroit was the city
i lived in the longest as a kid .
yes . i lived in , like , six different states
by the time i was ten .
at a certain point , i just ...
stopped trying to make friends .
got real comfy on that .
really ?
lot easier saying bye to your buddy &apos;s girlfriend
than it is your friend .
well , i &apos;m not gonna be
saying good @-@ bye to you anytime soon .
except for right now .
you want to do a butt bump ?
butt ...
ah , you &apos;re probably doing your own butt bumps .
cool . i know you guys are already done .
