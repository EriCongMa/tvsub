Please.
No! No!
No!
No! Uhh!
No. No. No.
No!
Maura Isles, you are brilliant!
Oh, I like the sound of that.
Oh...My.
It's great, right?
Oh, you were so right.
About what?
Oh, don't be modest. This is all you.
I can't believe I didn't listen to you sooner.
I'm not sure what it is you think I said,
but I am fairly certain
that there's been a miscommunication.
No, no, no, no, no. Come on.
All the nagging that you did about how I should...
change up my wardrobe, shake it up?
Well, I took your advice.
Well, I just meant you should expand your wardrobe a little.
Yes!
And I can't stop doing this!
Okay, well, it's a bold choice.
Mm! And the jacket's just the beginning.
What do you think about overalls?
Still avoiding calls from our father, are we?
I do not have time to chat.
I thought you were gonna talk to him.
Yes, I thought I was, too.
When's he leave?
Saturday. But he wants to get together tonight, have dinner,
go over some paperwork for the family trust.
Mm. Good. You guys can finally talk, get it all out.
What are you doing?
I'm helping. What time works for you?
That is not helping.
You can do this, Maura.
I wouldn't even know where to start.
Okay, well, how about, uh,
"You cheated on my mom and then made me lie about it,
which sucked"?
That sums it up nicely.
Yeah, but what good would it really do?
I mean, so much time has passed.
Yeah, but you're still carrying it around inside.
So you could just get it out and tell him how you feel.
Wait. You're one to talk.
You don't tell anyone how you feel.
Well, I'll tell you how I feel right now.
I feel that you should do this...
Or you're gonna be avoiding him forever.
That is a statement, not a feeling.
Doesn't make it any less true. Rizzoli.
‭Isles.
Do you wanna borrow my jacket?
Yeah, put it on and go like this.
Makes you feel incredible, like you could do anything.
Like shoot targets while riding a horse?
Yes, and solve crimes.
Yes. No, that sounds terrible.
No, I'm here. We'll be right there.
第六季 第九集
So don't make it a dinner with your father.
Do something casual.
My father and I don't do casual.
Well, maybe you should start.
You know, just meet, talk. Baby steps.
Nice jacket.
Mm, it was all Maura's idea.
I never mentioned fringe.
Victim's at the bottom of the hill.
Thank you, sergeant.
You messing with her?
Yeah.
I'm making a point,
but it's always so much more fun to amuse myself while I do it.
What do we got?
Well, hikers found him this morning.
Appears to have fallen from up top.
Ow. Yeah.
He was hard to see. The body was behind those rocks.
The victim was a student over at state.
Stuart Crane.
Only thing he had on him
was his student I.D. and keys.
No cash, no credit cards. No cell phone.
Robbery?
Possible.
C.S.R.U.'s up top. They haven't found much.
Prescott Trail is real popular. There's footprints everywhere.
Any witnesses?
Not so far.
Part of the cliff's broken away.
You can see where he tried to get himself up.
Must've lost his grip.
Crime techs found these.
Maura, anything interesting?
There are signs of rigor mortis on the jaw and hands.
I'd estimate the time of death to be about...
three to four hours ago.
Around sunrise.
Abrasions and bruising are consistent with a fall.
Might've slipped. Still pretty dark around dawn.
Except there are two wounds in the back of the skull
that resulted in a severely depressed fracture.
They appear too similar
to be from a random fall.
You think somebody hit him with something?
I can't be certain yet.
The wounds have abraded margins,
which could've been caused by something dense
or blows that were delivered with tremendous pressure.
Frankie, have C.S.R.U. pay close attention to the rocks up top.
Blood trace would be easy to miss.
Guess I'll be getting my cardio for the week.
There's unusual trauma to the fingers and hands.
Unusual how?
Well, the bones in the fingertips
appear to be broken.
Broken fingers and a cracked skull?
Doesn't sound much like a robbery.
Sounds like he pissed somebody off.
Like, dead dead?
I'm afraid so.
You two close?
I barely know the guy.
You were roommates.
Well, no offense, but dude's super boring.
Yeah, he's like an english major or somethin'.
Any idea why he was up at Prescott Trail
early this morning?
Well, he usually takes off before the sun's up.
Did he have any problems with anyone?
You know, arguments or fights?
Not that I ever heard about.
Do you mind telling me how you got that shiner?
Oh, I bodychecked a forward at hockey practice this morning.
It's nice, huh?
Wallet's here -- debit card, cash.
So it probably wasn't robbery.
I'm gonna get this phone to Nina,
see if she can unlock it.
It's weird that he didn't have it with him.
Most college kids,
it's like they have them permanently attached.
Have a feeling he's not like most college kids.
First edition "Don Juan." Lord Byron.
Probably worth a couple thousand dollars.
No way.
Couple thousand bucks for a book?
You know, like, just read it online, right?
Yeah. Right.
Thank you.
Go talk to some of the other kids in this dorm.
They can't all be knuckleheads.
These are spiral fractures.
The twisting pattern is caused by pressure being exerted
by a moving object.
Like someone was stepping on his fingers?
That would account for the pattern.
In fact, I believe it's likely that the damage was done
by a rubber-soled hiking boot.
Dr. Isles, are you actually speculating
about how this damage was inflicted?
I don't need to speculate. I have science.
Specifically...
I have Gaussian filters that can isolate dust particles.
I also found trace amounts of thermoplastic polyurethane
on the skin,
which is a synthetic rubber commonly found on hiking boots.
You really do love showing off your toys, don't cha?
I do.
I get it.
Now the cause of death
is the trauma to the back of the skull.
Two blows from the same dense object
from different angles.
The second blow was delivered
from a much higher vantage point.
So unless our killer had a sudden growth spurt,
Stuart fell, and then the killer hit him again.
That would correlate to my findings.
Okay. Thanks, maura.
26. 27. No, 28.
What's up?
Oh, you're not gonna believe this.
29.
No way.
30.
What's going on?
Nina unlocks Stuart's phone, and it's weird --
There's no email, no calendar programs, no apps,
but there's a lot of texts.
31.
Now that's just greedy.
31 what?
Women.
What?
Not just women. Girlfriends.
32.
Stuart Crane had 32 girlfriends?
Stuart wasn't just reading "Don Juan."
The guy was Don Juan.
It's hard to believe he had so many girlfriends.
Stuart doesn't seem like the type.
Some of these texts are sweet.
"Before I met you, I never knew what it was like
to think of someone and smile for absolutely no reason."
Seriously? Sounds like a cheesy greeting card.
I'd buy that card.
I would, too. Anything else interesting?
So far, the conversations are what you'd expect.
"How was your day? I miss you."
This woman is really into kittens.
He tells her all the time how much he loves them. Mnh-mnh.
So basically, he just tells them what they wanna hear.
Anybody talk to him about meeting this morning?
Not that I found yet.
As far as I can tell, he never met up
with any of the women he was dating.
And none of them seem to be from the college.
Maybe he met them online.
Maybe, but I didn't find anything like that
on his computer.
He only used this cell for chatting with his girlfriends,
nothing with friends or family,
which makes me think he has a second phone.
C.S.R.U. didn't find one at the crime scene.
Can you check with other service providers
and see if you can find something?
Frankie, can you go back to the dorm room,
see if you can find the phone?
Yeah.
Stuart Crane's mother lives in Ohio.
He has a sister over in Hartford. She's driving in now.
Hey, look at this.
"Contact my wife again, and you're a dead man."
There's a whole series of these.
Who's Donovan?
That's stuart's middle name.
He used it with all his girlfriends.
"You homewrecking asshole. I'll cut off your --"
Ooh! That's some colorful language.
Definitely not medically advisable.
Well, let's get a name and address.
Yeah, let's go see if he still has his...
Unbelievable.
That bastard had the nerve to call the cops on me.
You sent some pretty threatening messages.
You said you'd kill him in some pretty creative ways.
I was upset. Wouldn't you be if you found out
your wife had some secret boyfriend?
Sure. I might even be mad enough to confront the jerk,
knock him around a little bit. Is that how you felt?
I wanted him to stop contacting Heather.
I told you, honey, we were just texting.
It didn't mean anything.
If Donovan has a problem,
he should talk to me about it in person.
You have two convictions of disorderly conduct.
You got a temper?
I'm done with your questions.
Well, that's too bad 'cause we're not done asking.
Why don't we go downtown? You might feel better
about answering these questions down there.
Or you could just tell us where you were
from 5:00 to 6:00 this morning.
Why do you need to know where I...
Was this guy killed or something?
Because I've never even met him.
Then you won't mind answering the questions.
Between 5:00 and 6:00, I was working.
I pulled a double. Plenty of people saw me.
This is ridiculous.
Rick couldn't have killed Donovan.
Donovan's not even real.
Excuse me?
He's just an app.
An app?
You're kidding.
I-it's called yourperfectmate.
You sign up, and they give you a virtual boyfriend.
It's like a computer or something.
You've been texting with a robot?
He tells me I look pretty every day,
and you're never home. I...
I just wanted you to get a little jealous.
Looks like Stuart upgraded his image.
Rick Matthews' alibi checked out.
Witnesses saw him at work at the time of the murder.
I finished reading all the other texts.
Nothing suspicious, but I'm still running backgrounds.
Did Frankie track down the owners of yourperfectmate?
Yeah. Crane's been employed there for the last six months.
He handled up to 40 clients at a time.
Any problems?
They said he was a model employee.
您的兴趣 水上运动 马驹 计算机
Are you in the market for a fake boyfriend?
I don't think it's come to that yet.
I just wanna vet the app,
see if any obvious security flaws pop out.
Okay, so what do you do?
You pick the kind of guy you like?
Yeah. You answer questions about what you like --
age, hobbies, interests.
I said I like horses.
I could see you on a ranch.
Right?
Yeah.
So it's down to polo player or cowboy.
Mm, cowboy, of course.
Like that's even a real choice.
Looks like they saved the most important for last --
Funny or romantic?
Well, you can't have both.
let's go with funny.
So we hit "Meet my new boyfriend,"
And...Ooh! Hello, Winston.
There's somebody you could have a beer with.
Any luck on the second phone?
I found a number registered in crane's name.
Tried to call it, but the phone's powered off.
Frankie recanvassed the crime scene and the dorm
but didn't find the phone itself.
Did you subpoena the carrier for the phone records?
Yeah. Still waiting.
If...
Oh, it's from Winston.
"I'd ri--"
Oh, Winston's a bit naughty.
God, I love cowboys.
Who doesn't?
This is the last time that we were out together.
Over the summer.
You and your brother were close?
Stuart was the man of the family.
He was the youngest,
but he always knew what to say to make us feel better.
Do you know if he had any issues at school?
No. Being broke would probably be his biggest problem.
He was paying his own way through college.
That's why he started working for that, um...
Computer boyfriend thing.
Yourperfectmate.
We joked about it...
How growing up with four women was perfect training.
He enjoyed it...
At least until they stopped paying him.
He hadn't been paid?
No, not in weeks.
Did he say why?
The owners had promised funding was coming in,
but I told Stuart it sounded like
they were just stringing him along.
What made you think that?
I don't know.
The app has a lot of problems.
There was this one woman who had this crazy husband
who wrote terrible things to stuart.
I think we talked to him.
But it wasn't the first time
that something like this had happened.
Did he have problems with other clients?
Yeah.
But Stuart needed the money, so he put up with it.
Do you think that Stuart getting killed
had something to do with the app?
I mean, he just said nice things to people.
Why would somebody wanna hurt him for that?
We don't know exactly what happened.
But I promise you, we'll find out.
Maura. I'm so glad you called.
And the park -- wonderful idea.
There's a barista who makes a bracing espresso.
Can I bring you one?
No, thank you.
So...Routine paperwork.
I'm sorry it needs to be notarized.
That's fine.
I will have them for you by tomorrow.
That's fine.
I should get back.
Maura...
Can't we just talk?
I don't...
I don't know how to talk to you.
I haven't since I was 14.
Is this the way it's always gonna be between us?
I made a mistake.
I made a terrible mistake.
But your mother and I worked it out.
She forgave me for the affair a long time ago.
Why can't you?
You never asked me to.
You just...Acted like nothing ever happened.
Well, I didn't know how to talk to you about all that.
Well, you never tried.
I was embarrassed.
And I was traumatized... By you.
I understand how difficult things were...
no, you don't.
You don't, or you would have talked to me about it.
You would have told mom that I know.
You would've done something -- something other than
let me carry around this terrible secret
for all these years on my own.
You and your mother never talked about it?
You asked me not to say anything.
I didn't.
I was scared that mom would leave
if she knew that you asked me to keep this secret for you.
And...
Despite everything,
I wanted you to stay together.
I had...
I had no idea.
You went off to boarding school. I was out of the country.
So you thought things would get better
because we were on different continents?
Of course not.
So how exactly was that supposed to help?
I thought things would get easier with time.
They didn't. They got worse.
Your secret became my secret.
After all these years...
Maura...
I am grieved that you suffered for my stupidity.
It is the one thing in my life I most regret.
And if I could go back in time and change things,
I'd do that in a heartbeat.
I miss you so much.
I missed you, too...
For so long.
And then I got over it.
I'll text you when the papers are ready.
I wonder how many clients they have.
I don't know, but I guess a lot.
Not just lonely people.
What about a gay guy who's not out to his family?
Or a woman at work who wants the boss to stop hitting on her?
Or maybe you just want your mother
to stop pestering you about meeting someone nice
so you can settle down?
I'm just sayin'.
You don't think Stuart's death had something to do
with his job here?
That's what we're trying to find out.
That's crazy. Our clients loved him.
Uh, we heard there were problems.
Some hard feelings, maybe.
Nothing that anyone would kill someone over.
How do you know? Do you monitor every text
between your employees and clients?
No, but our cyranos report any problems,
and we deal with them.
Cyranos?
That's what we call our responders.
Cute.
Must be hard to keep responders
when you don't pay 'em for several weeks.
What are you talking about?
Our investor keeps delaying the new funding.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't want you to worry.
We heard he was pretty upset about it.
I assured him that he would be paid, every cent.
Would you mind telling us where you were
between 5:00 and 6:00 this morning?
He was right here. We both were. We practically live here.
Though it's obvious
we're not talking as often as we should be.
There's security footage if you want to see it.
We do. These problems that Stuart was having --
What happened?
A woman sent some inappropriate pictures.
Another tried to meet, but our system keeps
client and responder information anonymous.
Those conversations with former clients
weren't on his phone.
No, but we have them archived on our servers.
We'll need access to that data --
All your data, as a matter of fact.
So, how'd it go?
I did it. I talked to him.
Yeah? How do you feel?
Honestly, I don't feel any different.
I thought I'd be much more relieved,
like some big burden had been lifted.
Maybe it has.
Doesn't feel like it has.
Okay, well, you said that keeping your father's secret
is the reason that you break out in hives
when you tell a lie, right?
It's a working hypothesis.
Okay, so let's test it out. Lie to me.
What?
Yeah. Say something.
Anything. But make it big, so it counts.
And then we'll see if you break out in hives.
Jane -- - Lie to me!
I really like your new jacket.
‭Fringe has always been one of my favorites.
Are you itchy?
Not yet.
All right. I gotta go. But this is good.
Keep lying, all right? Keep it up.
Maybe you've had a breakthrough or something.
Oh, hey. The whole fringe jacket thing?
I'm not keeping it. I was just messing with you.
Jane, I love it when you play pranks on me.
Yeah, I'll get some chocolates.
Or -- or maybe flowers. Flowers are better, right?
Vince, just tell Kiki you're sorry.
Couples argue. It's normal.
Well, Kiki and I don't.
Mostly, we laugh.
This is our first argument.
I wanna make sure the apology is right.
What did you fight over anyway?
It was so stupid.
She kept talking about this wedding
she was looking forward to going to,
and she didn't invite me.
Did you offer to take her?
No!
Obviously, she didn't want me there.
And I got annoyed and said some things I wish I hadn't.
Oh, so you got your feelings hurt?
Just tell her.
I will.
Maybe over a really nice bottle of wine.
Uh... or over a burger and fries.
Hey, Kiki. You're looking gorgeous as always.
Thank you, Angela. It's nice to see you.
Nice to see you, too.
So, uh, your timing is perfect
because Vince was just telling me
how he had something very important
he wanted to talk to you about.
Adios!
I stopped by the station. They said I'd find you here.
Thank you.
Well, I thought we were going for more salads.
What can I tell you? I'm a work in progress.
‭Besides, more salads
doesn't necessarily mean fewer burgers.
I, uh, I just wanted to apologize for the other night.
I'm not sure exactly what happened --
You don't have to apologize. I do.
Were you upset about me going to the wedding?
I was...
Disappointed you didn't ask me to come along.
Well...
I just thought you wanted to take things slower.
Why would you think that?
Well, because you haven't introduced me
to any of your friends.
I mean, except for Angela,
and that was just because we were here.
Of course I want you to meet my friends,
and they are dying to meet you.
Oh, that's nice.
Maybe I'll throw a little get-together tomorrow night.
Oh, no, you don't have to do that.
Oh, I want to...
very much.
Accept my apology?
You want a burger?
I'd love one.
Hey, you free tomorrow night?
Yes. Anything to get me out of Frankie's apartment.
Are you two at each other's throats?
Yeah, he's just, you know...
"Don't drink my beer." "Put your pizza box away."
He's bossier than ma.
Well, it is his apartment.
Oh, that's nice. Take his side.
What's tomorrow night?
You wanna meet Kiki?
Well, it's about time.
Hey, Jane?
Yeah.
We've been going through the data
we got from Yourperfectmate.
Anything on Stuart's former clients?
Well, nothing suspicious, but we noticed something.
Two of his clients mentioned being burglarized
shortly after they began texting with him.
Both times, the women told Crane they'd be away from home
the night someone broke in.
Oh, so they text him the information,
and then he uses it to rob them.
Except that it's probably not Stuart.
We checked the client data
and cross-indexed it with police records.
There have been 27 burglaries reported
by Yourperfectmate clients over the last three months,
And they all follow the same pattern.
They target empty homes and unattended vehicles.
And they're all assigned to different responders.
Who has access to the company's data?
Unfortunately, a lot of people.
We ran their employee list through our database,
but no one popped.
We're gonna check them out one by one,
but it's gonna take some time.
I have an idea.
Do you still have the naughty cowboy?
Winston? At your service.
Who's winston?
Nina's fake boyfriend.
And I am texting him
how my brother...
leaves his electric guitars in his van at night.
What guitars?
The expensive ones.
Boston P.D.!
Turn around!
This is the part when you put your hands on your head.
27 burglaries. You've been busy, Evan.
I don't know what you're talking about.
We caught you red-handed.
All I did was break into one empty van.
So this had nothing to do with a text that was sent
by a Yourperfectmate client?
Where you just happen to be a programmer.
That van belonged to one of our users?
Wow. That's a hell of a coincidence.
Especially given that every one of these burglaries
also involves a Yourperfectmate client.
I don't know anything about those.
Oh, that's good...
because we compiled a list of everything that was stolen.
We're just waiting on a warrant for your apartment.
Wonder what we'll find in there.
Help us, and we'll talk to the D.A.
Okay.
Maybe I took advantage
of my access to some user information.
I mean, what are these women thinking,
Telling some total stranger all about their personal lives?
You know, if it wasn't me, it would've been somebody else.
But it was you.
You have help?
No.
It's hard to believe you could've pulled this off
without anyone else catching on.
Who? The owners? Like they'd ever notice.
Well, a Cyrano might've figured it out.
Someone like Stuart Crane? Maybe he wanted a piece?
Or confronted you about stealing from his clients?
Stuart Crane?
What's he got to do with this?
That's what we wanna know.
Something happen to him?
He was murdered.
Wait.
You think... I had something to do with this.
Did you? - I barely knew the guy. Okay? I --
If you know anything, you need to tell us.
This is serious, Evan.
Yeah, I get that.
I think I'd like a lawyer now.
Here you go.
Signed and notarized.
I hope this wasn't too much trouble.
Not at all.
Maura, I really am sorry.
I may never be able to express how much.
Thank you.
You're... probably busy,
but a colleague of mine is speaking this evening
on the development of the Khmuic tribes of Thailand and Laos.
The Khmu language is wonderfully rhythmic.
Yes. Yes, it is.
And Dr. Moore is quite engaging.
We used to enjoy the occasional anthropology lecture, didn't we?
We did.
Maura, I know I may never be able to repair
the schism between us, but perhaps tonight
we can just simply be two ordinary adults
attending a lecture on southeast Asian culture?
I appreciate the invitation, but I can't.
Well... perhaps next time I'm in town.
Have a safe trip.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Maura.
Can I ask you something?
You wanna know why I don't want to repair
my relationship with my father,
even though he is reaching out
and attempting to bridge the chasm
that has built up between the two of us over the past two decades.
Actually, I was gonna ask you
if you enjoyed those lectures as a young girl.
Oh. Yes. They were fascinating.
Sounds like a snooze fest to me.
But since you did bring it up,
why don't you wanna repair your relationship with your father?
He lives his life. I live mine.
That's how it's been ever since he cheated.
So I've just -- I've come to accept it.
You know, when your kids are little,
they look up to you. You're their whole world.
But, uh, parents are not perfect.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not excusing what your father did.
He made a mistake,
and one that has caused you so much...
pain and...anger.
Why hold on to that, Maura?
At this point,
I'm not certain I know how to let it go.
Well, you've lived with it for so long.
Maybe you should try something different
and see what happens.
Baby steps.
Are you sure we're talking about ma?
'Cause that's shockingly rational advice.
Well, your mother can be very rational.
We're talking about the same person
who thinks she started the led zeppelin riot in 1975?
Well, we can't prove she didn't.
Okay, did you find anything that links Evan Ballard
to Stuart's murder?
No, the rubber on the boots
that we found in the suspect's apartment
was not a match to what we found on the fingers.
I'm still waiting -- - Jane.
Stuart's personal cell phone just showed up online.
Can we track it?
We don't have a warrant for GPS data yet,
but whoever has the phone is using the camera.
Photos are uploading automatically to stuart's cloud storage.
Well, at least he didn't erase 'em.
Looks pretty run down.
Maybe a homeless person picked it up?
That looks like...
the lip of a skateboard at the bottom,
but...that's not any skate park I know. Where is that?
Isotria medeoloides.
You're so what?
The small whorled pogonia. It's a rare native plant.
I saw some on my hike through Franklin park.
And if I recall correctly,
there was an old maintenance area nearby.
Okay, well, let's assume you recall correctly.
How do we get there?
Off the main path,
you would travel approximately 40 degrees due west --
Nope.
Okay. Oh, if you start where the butterflies nest every spring...
How do I know where the butterflies nest?!
Well, you would know if you went on these hikes with me.
Who wants to go on a hike with -- - I don't wanna be that person,
but we only have a location if the phone stays on.
Wish granted! We're going on a hike. Lead the way.
My shoes are suede.
Keep walking.
This photo was uploaded two minutes ago,
and that building's in the background.
All right, backup's on the way,
but I don't wanna risk losing them. You wanna go around back?
‭You stay here.
What do you want to do?
All right, all right! I got next, though!
Boston P.D.
You know you guys aren't supposed to be here.
We're not bothering anybody, officer.
It's detective. Let me see your cell phones.
Why?
'Cause I said so.
Are we under arrest?
You keep acting like this, you might be.
Well, um, I don't see a warrant.
So unless you can prove probable cause
or an imminent threat,
we don't have to show you anything.
That's cute. That's really good. What, you a lawyer?
It's called Reddit, detective. We know our rights.
Let me explain to you about your rights -- -Jane.
Excuse me.
Look.
Okay, you know what? Scratch the cell phones.
I just need to see the moron who took this.
Hands behind your back.
Holiday's a badass!
Put that on Reddit.
You get anything from Evan Ballard?
Lawyer's still in with him.
Hey, Kiki's coming into the robber tonight.
Figured it's time for her to meet everyone.
Can you make it?
Sure. You're introducing her to all of us at once?
Brave man.
Yeah.
Hey, what's wrong?
You're not having second thoughts about Kiki, are you?
Oh, no, no. Kiki's great.
It's the healthiest relationship I've had in...
maybe ever.
But now that she's about to meet the family,
it's making me realize I...
I really wanna keep her around.
So what's the problem?
Well, my track record with women suggests
that the odds of this working out aren't so great.
Everyone's track record is terrible
until they meet the one that works.
When'd you get so smart?
Ah, I've always been smart.
Not that anyone would notice.
So far, the kid's sticking to his story.
Says he was hanging out on Prescott Trail yesterday around 6,
found the cell phone in the dirt.
And thought what, "Hey, free phone"?
Pretty much. And he figured out the password
by the finger smudges on the screen.
Smart.
That's not the first word I'd use to describe him,
but he says that he didn't see anyone or anything,
and that includes our body.
You believe him?
I'm starting to, yeah.
Stealing a cell phone hardly seems like a motive for murder.
Evan Ballard's lawyer wants to talk.
You think he's gonna cop to the killing?
I doubt it.
He seemed genuinely surprised when he heard Stuart was dead.
So we have two thieves and no killer.
Nina get anything off that phone?
She's working on it.
Hey. What do you got?
I went through Stuart's phone.
Mostly friends and family,
but I also found some texts from Heather Matthews.
The client with the jealous husband?
Her messages to Stuart started a week ago
and became increasingly agitated.
They suddenly stopped yesterday.
Look at this.
"I don't understand why you're ignoring me.
I know you were home yesterday."
That sounds like she might've been stalking him.
What do we have on her?
No criminal record,
but her bank account shows a withdrawal
of $2,500 from savings a week ago.
Might explain that first edition "Don Juan"
you found in Stuart's dorm.
Well, maybe it was a gift.
Heather also doesn't have much of an online presence,
but this may be why --
she's got three social media accounts that were closed
for inappropriate and abusive conduct.
Evan Ballard's lawyer wants to deal.
He know something about the murder?
Evan admitted that he sold information
to several Yourperfectmate clients
who wanted to learn the identities
of their online boyfriends.
Was one of them Heather Matthews?
It was. That's why he lawyered up.
Didn't want to be charged as an accessory to murder.
We gotta bring her in.
I'll get Jane.
Wait a second.
Gasoline.
She's gonna torch the place.
Get the front. I'll go around back.
Shit.
Boston P.D.! Don't move!
Get out.
Put the lighter up.
He said he was going to leave me.
Why does everyone wanna leave me?
Heather, listen to me, okay?
I understand that this is hard for you.
I thought Stuart loved me.
But then he told me it wasn't real.
He didn't even appreciate the book.
And it was a very thoughtful gift.
It was perfect!
I followed him onto the trail because...
I wanted him to understand how much I cared.
He told me to leave him alone.
Wait, wait, wait. Hey, hey, hey.
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me, okay?
I know that you did not want to hurt Stuart. Okay?
Just like I know you don't wanna do this.
I know you don't wanna hurt Rick. Okay?
I don't wanna hurt anyone.
Okay.
But nobody leaves me.
No!
Nice catch.
Easy. Take it easy.
Put your hands behind your back. It's gonna be okay.
You ready to go?
Oh, no.
What? I'm not messing with you.
Jane. Okay, I'm messing with you a little bit.
I got gasoline on my jacket,
and luckily, I had this...at...my chair.
Oh, goodness.
All right. Well, before we go...
there is something that I wanted to say.
Are you gonna make some sort of proclamation?
I am who I am
because of the things that have happened in my life,
the good and the bad.
Sounds very proclamation-y.
My relationships with my family
have been... challenging at times,
and they've certainly had a significant influence.
But other people have been just as important.
Do you mean super...smart and funny people
that don't mind borrowing leftovers from your fridge?
If it wasn't for you, Jane,
and your family,
I think I would probably be one of those people
that's sitting home on a Friday night,
reading medical journals.
And instead, I'm heading out for the evening,
surrounded by friends.
Oh, please. You love those medical journals.
That's true.
But you all keep me so busy, I never run out of new ones.
In that case, you're welcome.
Now let's go!
Please don't do that in public.
I can't help it!
Jane, that fringe is gonna scratch your cornea.
Or yours, so stay back!
I'll just do it to the car.
I promise... but keep your distance!
Oh, my God.
...and that's when I realized
the towel was stuck in the elevator door.
No!
Yes!
So what did you do?
So I stood up straight
and I saluted the very shocked army captain
and said, "Just doing my part for the enlisted men, sir."
I'll get the next round.
Oh, I'll get 'em.
No, let me. I'm in good with the owner.
Besides, when will you all have time to talk about me?
Okay, she's fantastic.
Why have you been hiding her all this time?
I was afraid you all might scare her off.
Mm. Oh, not a chance. She loves us.
And we love her.
I'm so happy I had a chance to meet her.
I'm sorry I have to leave.
I'm just happy you were here.
Thank you.
You sure you don't wanna take a twirl in the fringe jacket?
I'm seriously tempted, but I think I'm okay.
All right. But just so you know,
the fringe is always here for you.
Okay. Thanks.
Cam, I'll catch up with you after the lecture, if that's okay?
As it turns out,
I couldn't resist the pull of a Dr. Moore lecture.
Well, I can hardly blame you. You're only human.
Shall we?
Sure.
One thing I should mention
in the interest of full disclosure...
What's that?
I actually find the Eastern Khmu dialect
more interesting than the Western Khmu.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Oh, no, no. Narrow registration, tonal palate.
The language is much purer.
