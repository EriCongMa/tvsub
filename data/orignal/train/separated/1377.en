Oh, God, no.
I've experienced some symptoms,
headaches, um, occasional memory loss.
Yes, I-I was diagnosed with Chiari Malformation after the fall.
Yes. Yes, I've decided to have decompression surgery.
My -- my doctor thinks that it could eliminate
some of the pressure caused from the injury.
Later today.
No, no. There's no reason for you to go out of your way.
It -- it is a minor procedure. I will be home tomorrow.
Okay, I've -- I've gotta run.
Okay, talk to you soon.
‭Okay. I told you it was a bad idea to call her.
Now she wants to come by the hospital.
Maura, she's concerned.
Well, there's nothing to be concerned about.
It's what mothers do.
I don't want to make a big deal out of it.
What have you got there?
Heaven in a bag.
Bernie Brody's Bodacious Bagels.
Is that the new place around the corner?
Yeah, with a line around the block.
Aw. I can't have anything before my surgery.
But that isn't until this afternoon.
I know, but I have to fast.
It's okay. Please, no. You guys go ahead.
Rizzoli.
Isles.
Yeah, I got it.
Okay. We'll be right there.
What about your surgery?
Well, it's not till 1,
so I figured I would work till then just like any other day.
It's still warm.
I hate you.
Put it in your pocket.
Wh --
Do you know the hole in the middle
provides for more even cooking?
But also allow people to thread a string through it
for easy handling and transportation?
No.
They even gave it to women in childbirth as gifts
in 17th century Poland.
Who knew that there was that much bagel trivia
to last a 30-minute car ride?
Oh, I'm so hungry. Hello, Sergeant.
Victim is Michelle Stevens.
Husband said she fell down the stairs in the middle of the night.
Anybody see her do it?
No.
Daughter found the body. Husband called 9-1-1.
Any sign of forced entry?
Nothing broken or jimmied.
There are some scuff marks by a window in the back.
Couldn't tell how old they are.
Sergeant Korsak? We need you in the den.
There's a lot of blood.
The victim sustained severe cranial trauma
resulting in massive hemorrhaging.
That's another way to put it.
There's blood on the railing.
Yeah, and the position of the body
is consistent with a slip and fall,
and an initial wound caused by striking the railing
on the way down, but I can't say for sure.
Yeah, but the railing didn't cause the massive hemorrhaging,
or there'd be more blood on the stairs, right?
Yeah, more than likely.
At least some spatter.
I'll give you that.
So...she lands hard at the bottom of the stairs,
starts bleeding,
maintains consciousness long enough
to smear blood on the walls before passing out.
That is consistent with what we see.
Interesting.
I wonder if that place makes cherry bagels.
How'd you get here? Connecticut?
No. I, uh, came the usual way.
The usual way is with Korsak.
Hey, Frankie.
Nina said you left this in the car.
Thanks, Garcia.
Nina brought you to work today?
The victim's husband and daughter are waiting to talk to us.
Okay.
We're very sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
What time did you find your mother, Clair?
Um...around 2.
That's pretty late.
I got up to go to the bathroom.
I went out and...
Was she breathing?
No.
She was just lying there.
So still.
Had you heard anything before that?
No.
What about you, Mr. Stevens?
Sorry?
Did you hear anything like a-a thump or call for help?
No. The, um, the bedrooms are on the other end of the house.
You didn't know she'd gotten out of bed?
I don't know if she ever got into bed.
Um, my wife and I were down here drinking,
and, uh, I got tired, so I decided to go upstairs.
Michelle wanted to watch TV, so I, um...
I left her.
She must've come upstairs later in the dark,
tipsy from all the red wine and slipped and, uh...
And that's when Clair found her?
I heard Clair scream.
Can I lie down?
Is it okay? The, um, the EMTs gave her sedatives.
That's fine, but we need to collect your clothes.
Yes, and also we need your permission to search the property.
Why?
Just to rule out foul play.
Yeah, of -- of course.
Whatever you need.
Thank you.
It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
How you doing?
Well...
Careful.
Dietary restrictions has her a little bit grumpy.
I am not grumpy!
I'm simply focused.
Why don't you go home, Maura?
Because it is a work day, and I have work to do.
Okay.
So what'd you find?
Well, there were high levels of alcohol in her system...
...just like her husband said,
and the bruising on the back of her body...
...is consistent with a fall down the stairs.
What the hell is that?
He's working with melons.
Well, you don't break out the melons
for a simple slip and fall, do we, Kent?
No, Jane, we don't.
Now observe.
This is the equivalent of falling down a flight of stairs.
Certainly painful, but not fatal.
Now this is the amount of force that'd be required
to sustain the victim's injuries.
Like a fruit homicide.
Fruiticide.
Due to the severe cranial damage,
I can't say exactly what struck her.
But I do know that she didn't do it to herself.
Any questions, Detective?
Just one.
What did these melons ever do to you?
What'd you find out about our family?
Oh, they're pretty impressive on paper.
So are the Kardashians.
Well, Michelle's an Ivy League-educated lawyer
with a thriving practice.
Maybe she made an enemy in court?
She doesn't go to court.
Her specialty is contract law. It's pretty tame stuff.
What about Robert?
Stanford alum.
He's got a successful antiquities business
dealing in Greek artifacts.
And he's active in charity work,
volunteers at his daughter's school.
He coached her field hockey team.
What about the daughter?
She's an honor student and an athlete.
I mean, they don't have any financial problems.
There's no history of domestic violence,
no criminal records.
These don't seem like the type of people who kill each other.
Well, there were scuff marks around the window.
Maybe someone else got in the house.
‭Clair has a boyfriend.
She texted him several times last night
about a fight with her mother.
Then there was a series of phone calls between them.
That's something Clair never mentioned in her moment of grief.
Well, if you want, I could give your doctor a breathalyzer.
That won't be necessary.
Good, 'cause I don't think it's legal.
But I would do it if it would make you feel better.
There's nothing to worry about.
You know, the operation lasts a couple of hours.
They make a small incision in the back of the neck.
They push the skin and the muscle aside
and remove a piece of the skull to relieve the pressure.
That doesn't sound so simple.
I promise you, I will be up and walking around by this evening.
Hello, everyone.
Hello.
Hi, Hope.
Come on in.
I told you, you didn't have to come.
Well, I couldn't stay away.
Plus, I wanted to speak with your surgeon
before he put you under.
Well, I'll see you in recovery.
I told her she didn't have to come to the hospital.
I know that you don't want to make a big deal about this,
all right, but she's your mom.
They...
Butt in.
All the time.
Okay, we don't have this kind of easy rapport.
You think this is easy?
It's not.
She's tough, she's stubborn,
she's hard on me for everything.
What? You're lucky to have me.
You're lucky to have me.
I know!
Hope and I, we're -- we're just...
we don't know how to do this whole mother/daughter thing.
What is it that you said, that you --
you wanted to create new neural...
thingies?
Pathways.
All right, well, maybe this is your chance now
to create new...
mother/daughter pathways.
Gary Carver?
Are you Clair Stevens' boyfriend?
Maybe.
Do you know why we're here?
No.
Clair's mother was murdered.
What the hell?
Where were you last night?
I was at a party at a friend's.
Does this friend have a name?
Steve Ulrich.
Clair go with you?
Yeah.
When did you plan to get together?
Right before I picked her up.
Clair had a fight with her mom
because she wouldn't let her go out,
and I told her about the party,
and she asked me to come get her.
So you picked her up at her place?
Yeah. She snuck out.
How long did you stay at the party?
When we got there, she was acting weird,
so we -- we hung out for a little while,
but I finally told her to go home.
Did you drive her?
No.
So Chivalry is dead. How'd she get home?
She said she'd figure it out. I-I don't know what she did.
I never left the party. I crashed there.
Have you talked to Clair today?
No.
Write down Steve Ulrich's number, please.
You can go.
Thank you.
Don't leave town.
I wonder why Clair didn't mention she went to a party.
What's going on between Frankie and Nina?
Frankie and Nina?
Yeah, remember them?
I don't know. I don't know what you're talking about.
They're so dating. I knew it!
Okay, how serious is it?
I never said they were dating.
You didn't have to. Come on.
When has Frankie ever been able to keep a secret from me?
Hello.
All right, thank you.
Listen to me.
Maura's gonna be out for a few more hours.
If you hear anything, please call me. Okay?
Okay, do me a favor.
What?
You have to let Frankie tell you about Nina himself.
Of course.
I mean it.
You say that like I don't listen to you.
That's because you never listen to me!
Well, then why say it?
You didn't tell us the truth about last night.
No. My client was sedated.
She can't be held accountable for her omissions.
That's not what we're saying.
Why did you think a lawyer was necessary?
A friend from her mother's law firm insisted.
He said it's what Michelle would've wanted.
You and your mother have a fight?
Yeah.
What'd you fight about?
My boyfriend and not letting me...
She had words with her mother about going out.
Clair went upstairs. She snuck out the window
and went with the boyfriend to a party.
When she got home,
she found her mother at the bottom of the stairs.
What time did she get home?
Michelle was so tough on Clair.
How tough?
Well, she thought she was too young to have a boyfriend.
And what did you think?
That we should all get along.
I try to be a peacemaker.
Everybody my age has a boyfriend.
It's not fair! She -- she didn't like anyone that I liked.
Clair...
Is that why you texted your boyfriend
that you hated her?
I didn't say that.
Clair, we have the texts.
I was just mad. She was always yelling at me!
Clair. Clair, that's enough.
Those texts don't mean anything.
You sure? - She -- she was just angry.
She -- she would never hurt her mother.
We verified everything the boyfriend told us
except his whereabouts after Clair left.
Kid throwing the party said the boyfriend went into a guest room,
but he didn't see him again till the next morning.
It could be he passed out.
Or he could've gone to Clair's house
with her and killed her mother.
Neither Clair nor her boyfriend
have ever been in trouble with the police.
And it's a long way from being mad at your mother
to killing her.
I should know.
Yeah.
Well, it wouldn't be the first time
young lovers did something crazy.
You're never gonna believe what Nina and I just dug up.
Try me.
20 years ago, Robert's girlfriend,
who he was living with at the time, died accidentally.
Guess how?
She fell down some stairs.
While Robert was sleeping.
Almost exactly the same as our victim.
I was doing background research on Robert,
but couldn't find any record of him attending Stanford.
Made me think maybe he was lying.
Turns out he didn't go to Stanford.
He went to Seattle Community College.
So I called the school and talked to a librarian.
She dug up an old article that mentioned how Robert
found his girlfriend dead in their apartment.
And I got ahold of the Seattle detective who handled the case.
Robert told him that he was sound asleep the night
that his pregnant girlfriend fell down the stairs.
Police found no signs of foul play,
so they ruled it an accident.
In the world of coincidences, that's a doozy.
Which probably means it wasn't a coincidence.
We need that case file.
Good job, you two.
Thanks.
Yeah.
How are you feeling?
A bit of a headache from the anesthesia.
I'll bet.
But I remembered my name.
And I completed a memory inventory
of the skeletal structure from the "Gray's Anatomy" chart.
And where would I find my levator anguli oris?
There are two located symmetrically
on either side of your face.
And when they work in unison,
the corners of the mouth move upward,
producing what is universally known as a smile.
Textbook-perfect.
Excellent sign of long-term memory.
Jane has been calling every 20 minutes.
Then I let her know that you are on your way up.
And I also...
asked Angela to let me take care of you.
I hope that's okay.
Of course.
Well, anything else that I can get you now?
I'm good.
Okay.
How's Maura?
She is out of surgery
and in the recovery room and doing fine.
You're gonna like this.
Robert came from a blue collar background,
even though he claims a childhood of affluence and privilege.
And his antiquities business hasn't been very profitable.
So for the past 15 years,
he's been living off his wife's money?
Which he'll get half of now that she's dead.
Motive.
Who gets the other half?
Clair.
Motive.
Yeah, but Clair didn't kill his college girlfriend.
No, she didn't.
Let's go rattle his cage.
Paging Dr. Price.
Please report to the emergency room immediately.
Why is this so difficult?
Because we don't really know each other.
And you have a daughter, and I have a mother.
Square peg, round hole.
Something like that.
I always thought about you, Maura.
When Kateline's hurt her knee and I bandaged it...
I thought about what it would've been like to take care of you.
And when I took her to her first day of school,
I pictured your first day.
I'd still like to take care of you,
even if it's just for today.
Sure.
We just wanna speak to him.
He's already told you everything he knows about this matter.
He did not tell us how his college girlfriend died.
That's what this is about?
Robert, be quiet.
What are the odds that his girlfriend and his wife
both fall down a flight of stairs
and die from head injuries?
You'd have a better chance of getting struck by lightning twice
after buying the winning Powerball ticket.
It's just a coincidence.
Great. Prove it. Take a lie detector test.
That's not admissible in court.
Then what's the problem?
Give us a reason to believe you.
Your name is Robert Andrew Stevens?
Yes.
Was Holly Franklin your girlfriend in college?
Yes, she was.
Did you live together?
Yes, for almost two years.
Did you two fight?
Not much.
Did you have anything to do with her death?
No. It was ruled an accident.
He's smart.
He's playing us.
Hey, you gotta see this.
Over the last two months,
Robert supposedly went on three business trips to Europe.
I finally heard back from I.C.E. about his passport.
There's no record of any overseas travel.
So where was he?
Well, credit cards place him downtown.
So we canvassed the area around his last purchase.
Someone at the Four Seasons remembered him.
We got security video showing him with three different women
on three different nights.
And if his wife found out...
Bye-bye, gravy train.
Well, he has agreed to talk in front of us.
Yes?
Now's our chance to get him on the record.
What's she doing?
We're about to find out.
Did you ever have an affair, Robert?
What are you talking about?
Did you cheat on your wife?
You don't have to answer that.
No, I never cheated on her.
Explain these photos, please.
Those are women I had sex with,
but I wouldn't consider it cheating
because my wife knew all about them.
Shit.
We had an open marriage.
So your wife had affairs, too?
You don't really wanna know about our relationship.
You just wanna hear me say that I...murdered her.
So why don't you have the guts to ask me to my face, Detective?
Did you kill your wife?
No.
Looks like he's telling the truth.
And it's on the record.
I mean, I know he that he passed the lie detector test,
but it's just...
something... something's not right.
Well, I can't tell you whether Robert's guilty or not,
but the one thing I'm certain of are your instincts.
Now people can beat lie detectors,
especially if they're pathological liars.
They do it so often there's no physiological response to lying.
And that's all these machines read.
Well, he's definitely a pathological liar.
Then don't second guess yourself.
I was worried about you.
I know.
I'm not saying that because you said something nice about me.
Really, like, you -- are you sure that you're okay?
You know, the surgery went well. I feel pretty good.
But will it fix the problem? Only time will tell.
I thought some homemade chicken soup would be perfect.
And the compound carnosine --
it purifies the blood and it aids in healing.
And it smells so good.
Mm.
Jane, would you like some soup?
Oh, uh, no, thank you.
I've, uh, I gotta get back to work.
Ooh, I think I want a bagel, too.
Eh. Sit. Oh.
I will get you one.
It's hard to get used to being mothered.
You sort of have to surrender to it.
That's what daughters do.
Be good.
Hi. How's it going?
Frankie found another kid at the party.
He saw the boyfriend passed out in a guest room
2:00 A.M., so we can take him off the list.
And what about his claims of his open marriage?
Well, the wife is dead.
We didn't find any evidence of an affair. So...
the only thing we're positive he lied about
is where he went to college.
But lots of people lie on their résumé.
It doesn't make them murderers.
What about the girlfriend's death?
Well, I can't believe I'm saying this,
but what if it is a coincidence?
I know, I know. It's ridiculous.
But we gotta find some evidence to convince the D.A.
He's not gonna trust your gut the way I do.
Okay, so we had three people in the house that night,
and one of 'em ends up dead.
So either Robert killed Michelle
or Clair did or they did it together.
But Robert has controlled every aspect
of our interaction with Clair.
He had her sedated at the crime scene.
He had a lawyer answer most of our questions for her.
Which tells us if they were both involved, he didn't trust her.
Or if he killed his wife,
Clair knows something that could expose them.
The only way to figure that out is to talk to Clair alone.
We can't do that. She has a lawyer.
The only problem is if she incriminates herself.
Which could be a very big problem.
You're not supposed to talk to me.
Well, technically,
you walked over here and started talking to me.
You can walk away if you want to.
You headed to practice?
My dad says that we have to stay busy
after my mom's accident.
It wasn't an accident, Clair.
I can let you talk to the medical examiner if you want.
Well, then what happened?
We're not sure,
but if you didn't kill her...
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
My card is in your backpack.
If you know something,
if you see anything unusual, you call me.
You are the only one who can speak for your mother now.
Haven't we been harassed enough by you people?
If you wanna speak to us, call our lawyer.
What'd she say?
I am sure that you will be ready
to go back to work tomorrow.
I hope so.
What do you mean?
I just... worry about my memory.
What if it affected my ability to testify?
Or what if the surgery didn't work?
There's no reason to go there yet.
I just -- I don't know what I would do
if I didn't work in the M.E.'s office.
Well, there are always alternatives.
Science and medicine aren't just parts of my job.
They're parts of who I am.
So I don't know who I would be without it.
Well, I'm just suggesting that
there might be another avenue for your gifts.
Like what?
Like working with the living instead of the dead.
And I happen to know a woman who has several clinics
who could really use someone like you.
You never know where life leads, Maura.
But one thing that I am certain of --
you will have a fulfilling life after your career as an M.E.
Guess who I just heard from?
Robert's lawyer?
That's right. He's talking police harassment.
Well, we don't have a case.
I doubt he can sue us without one.
Well, maybe we don't have a case
because we focused on the wrong person.
Clair had nothing to do with this.
He is threatening us so we stay away from her.
And she is the only liability that he has left.
‭Rizzoli.
O-okay, okay. W-where are you?
Okay, stay put. All right, we'll be right there.
Clair followed Robert to some storage facility.
What the hell is wrong with you people?!
There he is.
Let me see your hands!
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car slowly.
Now! Now!
Korsak.
I got him.
I'd love to hear you explain this one.
Where's your lawyer?
I don't need him.
Well, we're all ears.
I, um...
I lied about what happened to my wife.
I heard a commotion that night.
Arguing.
And what sounded like someone falling down, then a scream.
I, uh, jumped out of bed,
ran down the hallway, and found...
my wife laying at the bottom of the stairs.
Why would Clair kill her mother?
I think she just snapped.
Michelle was always so hard on her,
always putting her down.
Clair wasn't strong enough, smart enough, pretty enough.
Her boyfriends were never good enough.
So if Clair lashed out and killed her mother,
why did we find you with the murder weapon?
Clair begged me to help her.
I had just lost my wife.
I-I couldn't lose my stepdaughter, too.
Exactly what did you do?
Clair and I came up with the story
that Michelle fell down the stairs.
I took the murder weapon straight to the storage facility
and hid it.
Then I came home and...
and sent Clair to the party with her boyfriend
so that she would have an alibi.
I waited for her to -- to come back home and, uh, we --
She had called 9-1-1.
And why hang on to the murder weapon?
I-I didn't know what to do with it.
Didn't have time to destroy it so I just hid it,
figured that I'd deal with it later.
Is that what you were doing tonight?
I told Clair that I was gonna get rid of it,
put this behind us once and for all,
but I guess she figured that if you found me
with the murder weapon, that you would be convinced
that I was the m--
killer, and she would get away with murder.
But why would she think that? You both were in the clear.
Because she really doesn't trust anybody,
even me.
It's Maura.
Be right back.
Yeah.
The field hockey stick may possibly be the murder weapon.
Possibly?
Well, I can't match
the shape of the stick to the wound pattern
because the cranial damage was so severe.
But the blood on the stick matches the victim's.
Are his prints on it?
There are a lot of prints on it, but they all belong to Clair.
Well, he could've been wearing gloves when he used the stick.
Well, if that were the case,
then we'd expect to see smudges on the prints,
but there were none.
Ah, there you are.
Uh, we just received the autopsy report
from Robert's ex-girlfriend in Seattle.
I put it on your desk.
Great. Could you please lay out all of the photos
so we can go over it together?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, so if Clair hit her mother with the field hockey stick,
then we would've found high velocity blood spatter.
We would expect to see a cast-off pattern
on the wall and the floors,
which is why I re-examined all of the crime scene photos,
but there weren't any.
Because the blood on the wall was smeared.
And the pool of blood under the victim
obscured any pattern.
Robert is either
the smartest criminal or the luckiest.
Or he didn't do it.
Look at these pictures.
His girlfriend died the exact same way 20 years ago,
even down to the smeared blood on the walls.
Mm, fair enough.
But if you take the girlfriend out of the equation,
all of the physical and circumstantial evidence
points to Clair.
You can't take the girlfriend out of the equation.
That's nuts.
It doesn't matter.
The girlfriend's case is not admissible.
Unfortunately, the D.A.'s decided we have enough evidence
to charge Clair with murder.
No.
We've been ordered to bring her in. Come on, Frank.
No, no, no. I'll do it. I'll do it.
Go with her.
Yeah.
What's going on?
The D.A. has decided to charge you.
I don't understand.
You're under arrest for the murder of Michelle Stevens.
Y-you said that you needed my help.
You said that I was doing the right thing for my mom.
And now you're arresting me?
Frankie...
I'm so sorry, Clair.
You were right about Robert.
I found something in the M.E.'s autopsy report
on Robert's Seattle girlfriend.
The wound pattern and the stair matched perfectly.
But what the M.E. missed 20 years ago
was the force in which her head hit the stair.
That's why the police ruled the death accidental.
So he must've pushed his girlfriend down the stairs
and then stood over, taken her head,
and slammed it against the bottom step.
According to this case file, yes.
But our victim's head wound was so significant
that I couldn't conclusively match it to the stair
or the field hockey stick.
Why use a field hockey stick
when he knew how to kill her with his bare hands?
He didn't.
The field hockey stick isn't the murder weapon.
He just kept it so he could blame Clair for the murder
if we didn't rule the death accidental.
So if he killed his wife
the same way he killed the girlfriend,
the major thing that he had to clean up was the blood spatter.
That's why he smeared the wall.
And he knew that the pooling blood would obscure
the evidence on the floor.
That's right. But his shoes and his pants
had to have been covered in blood.
So he had to ditch his bloody clothes. But where?
The only logical place
would be to dump the clothes at the storage unit.
We searched his unit. We didn't find anything.
Then they're nearby.
Come on.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Hey! Hey. Can I help you?
BPD.
Garbage was picked up yesterday.
Does everyone know that?
Pickup schedule is posted on bulletin board.
He dumped it here because he knew it'd be gone.
Do you have people rummage through these dumpsters?
Yeah. They make a real mess.
Hey, you remember the homeless guy
with the grocery cart full of cans?
The one you almost ran over.
Why you get...
Thank you.
Hey there.
How you doing?
I'm surviving.
We, uh, saw you at the storage facility.
You were the one.
You were driving like a maniac.
I'm sorry about that.
You go through the dumpsters yesterday?
I don't remember.
Looking for some pants, shoes?
I don't remember seeing that.
You sure? I'd give you 20 bucks for 'em.
I'll give you 30.
I, uh, I came as soon as I got your message about Clair.
But, um, how can I help her?
You can take her place.
You remember these?
Never seen 'em before.
Really?
'Cause that's your wife's blood on the outside
and your DNA on the inside.
Robert Stevens, you're under arrest
for the murder of Michelle Stevens.
I want a lawyer.
Get a good one.
You have the right to remain silent.
You okay?
I don't have anybody now.
You have me.
I'm not going anywhere.
What happens next?
Next, we go and talk to Child Services.
Okay?
I'm so scared, Jane.
I know.
But I'll be with you the whole way.
There you go.
Can I come in?
Of course. Please.
Oh. You're going out.
Only to the Dirty Robber.
There's no rush. What's up?
Well, I just -- I wanted to thank you for calling today
to let me know that things went well with the doctor.
So far so good.
And I wanted to give you this.
It's information about
our volunteer programs at the clinic.
I don't plan on leaving the M.E.'s office anytime soon.
No, of course not.
But I wanted you to know that there are several doctors
that volunteer just on a limited basis.
And if you ever wanted to talk about it
or take a tour of the facilities...
But I don't wanna keep you, so we'll talk later.
Okay.
Hope. Wait.
Could we take a tour now?
Oh, no. You're -- you're going out to see your friends.
That's okay. I can go see them later.
Then right now is...
perfect.
Great.
I'm excited to see it.
What are you doing here?
Jane asked me to meet her here.
Me too.
What's going on?
Well, we've been having fun with this lie detector.
We've been hooking people up to this
and learned all kinds of crazy things.
Like what?
Why don't you try out?
Have a seat. Roll up your sleeves.
Why don't we get drinks?
Yeah.
We just started a round.
Have a seat, Frankie.
Okay.
Nina and I are dating.
No.
Yes.
Frankie and Nina are dating.
What?
How exciting.
Okay. Nina, we are very happy for you.
Slightly worried, concerned,
but mostly happy.
Thank you.
The real reason this is down here
is because I want to know what happened to my autographed
Bobby Orr hockey puck that disappeared in 7th Grade.
No way.
Plea the fifth.
What? You're his attorney?
No, just a concerned citizen.
Oh, she's already sticking up for him.
Yeah, I like that.
Me too.
Sit down, Frankie.
I'm not attaching myself to that machine.
You'd have nothing to hide, you'd sit down.
I don't have anything to hide.
Because you know you stole it.
I didn't take it.
You stole it!
I didn't steal it. No.
Sit down!
I don't wanna sit down.
Mom, make him sit down!
