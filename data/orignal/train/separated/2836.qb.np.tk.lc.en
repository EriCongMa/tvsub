so , good ! we &apos;ll see you at the park at two.cheers !
oh , boy ! i just love to sing .
yes , i know you do .
the reason people complained .. was because they paid to hear the actor sing &quot; old man river .. &quot;
look at us !
who would &apos;ve thought cupid had a station at 14th street nails ?
okay , we have to talk .
i &apos;m just getting out of a very serious relationship .

well , i will just have to soak up every ounce ... of chandler bing
until that moment comes .
but i do know it &apos;s sometime tomorrow .
done ?
yep !
what &apos;s up ?
this switch is driving me crazy .
i turned it off and checked every outlet .
four don &apos;t work , which means one is controlled by the switch .
so i plugged things in the outlets that make noise .
that way , when i turn it on , i just follow the noise .
bet i stopped listening first .
you know , you also could have used lamps ... and followed the light .
yeah , well , i &apos;m using noise .
so , everybody ready ? here we go !
something . i hear something . where is it ?
it &apos;s coming from joey !
oh , my god ! that &apos;s so freaky ! turn him off !
could we put on the news ? it might be raining .
hold on . i &apos;m watching this rugby thing on espn .
i &apos;m man enough to play this sport !
you &apos;re not even man enough to get the channel that carries the sport .
hey there , ross !
janice .
you know , you really didn &apos;t have to help me pack .
when you said all you &apos;d be doing before you leave is packing ... you really didn &apos;t leave me much choice
i thought i did , but i guess i did not .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m packing , you know , because i &apos;m moving to yemen tomorrow .
thanks for telling me !
i &apos;m going to be pretend @-@ moving to yemen . to get rid of her .
good one !
yemen ! that actually sounds like a real country !
i &apos;ll show you how to roll your underwear and stuff it in your shoes .
it &apos;s a space @-@ saver .
i do that because it makes me look taller .
come on !
joey , trade lives with me .
nope .
ross , i can &apos;t believe you said you &apos;d play .
this is brutal ! i can handle it .
please , ross . you got hurt playing badminton with my dad .
that &apos;s because your mom &apos;s dog kept looking at me .
look ! right here , it &apos;s called a &quot; scrum . &quot; it &apos;s like a huddle .
and is a hum like a scruddle ?
ross , they &apos;re going kill you !
why are you doing this , anyway ?
you should &apos;ve seen the guy she used to date .
he &apos;s like &quot; joe rugby &quot; !
you &apos;re kidding ! and he plays rugby ? that &apos;s funny !
oh , i see . you did that .
she thought the very idea of me playing rugby was hilarious .
so i &apos;ll show her how tough i really am .
i &apos;m sorry . you are a tough guy .
the toughest paleontologist i know .
ross can take care of himself .
it &apos;s not like he &apos;s chandler.thanks.
don &apos;t worry about me .
i &apos;ll just look energetic and stay away from the ball .
i &apos;ll be that guy , right outside the circle .
maybe there was a dog looking at him .
stay away from that guy and that guy ...
... and that one . dude , they &apos;re all huge !
they &apos;re no bigger than me .
you &apos;re closer to you . so you look bigger to you from where you are .
i &apos;m going to go say &quot; hello . &quot;
i kind of liked it .
i know what to do.i &apos;ve got to go red ross .
you know , red ross ?
totally don &apos;t know .
that time we were in line for dances with wolves ...
... and that guy cut in front of us and i just lost it ?
screamed at him , turned all red !
red ross !
you &apos;ll see !
liam , do me a favor .
go easy on ross . it &apos;s his first time .
you don &apos;t say ?
good luck , babe .

come on , get in the bloody scrum !
ross , get in !
joey !
you &apos;re not going to believe it ! joshua came in today , and guess what ?
he asked you out ?
but i showed him some cuff links , and i felt his pulse .
saucy !
what are these ?
electrical plans for the building .
okay , should i be scared ?
i know that switch does something . i got these from city hall .
i just paid $ 25 and waited for three hours .
wow ! if only more people knew !
all right , do you understand any of this ?
no , i don &apos;t understand any of this electrical stuff .
all right , does this look like a switch ? i don &apos;t know .
ls this wiring ?
i don &apos;t know .
that looks like a bunny though .
you really didn &apos;t have to take me to the airport .
oh , please . every moment is precious .
besides , someone had to ride with your luggage .
and your friends don &apos;t seem to care that you &apos;re leaving .
we &apos;re not that close .
okay . so i guess this is goodbye then .
oh , no ! it &apos;s not goodbye . i &apos;m not leaving till you get on that plane .
okay . well , i guess it &apos;s just &quot; wait here &quot; then .
i need a fake ticket to yemen .
one ticket ?
i just need a pretend ticket .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t understand .
okay , what would you give a kid to play with ?
are you traveling with a child ?
no .
she &apos;ll think i &apos;m handing you a credit card .
but what i &apos;ll really hand you is a library card .
a ticket to yemen is $ 2100 , and we don &apos;t take library cards .
what &apos;s the matter ? is something wrong ?
do you have to stay ?
american express ?
i can &apos;t believe they &apos;re doing that ! i told them to go easy on him !
no offense , but sometimes it &apos;s hard to understand you , with the accent .
that &apos;s just halftime . there &apos;s more .
did you see me ? i was pretty good .
that is one fun game !
do me a favor ? grab me some water ? thanks !
i think i &apos;m dying . i really do .

no ! i &apos;m not stopping . i &apos;m red ross !
dude , you go back out there , you &apos;ll be dead ross .
i &apos;m not quitting . i &apos;m going to finish this game .
if you insist on it , at least let me help you .
it &apos;s no place for a woman . those guys will grab anything !
that &apos;s not it . i just know a few things that can help you inflict pain .
i like that .
listen closely.devon has got a weak ankle
one swift kick and he &apos;ll back off .
bad ankle . got it !
and that big bloke with the beard ? he &apos;s got a trick hip .
and david over there , he doesn &apos;t wear a cup .
i could use that . trick hip , no cup . okay !
and liam &apos;s got bad knees . hit him right and he &apos;ll go down like a lamp .
but liam &apos;s on my team .
i don &apos;t care . just get him !

oh , my god ! look at this !
but there is a wire there ! it &apos;s connected to something !
i don &apos;t care ! the wires have come loose in your head !
if i could follow the wire , i &apos;d find out what it did .
