第十六集
Our secret remains safe.
The Author's pen?
I'm gonna write the stories as they are,
and I'll start with Hades.
She's pregnant.
You two had a contract,
which he just signed over to me.
At any time, I can cash in and take...your...baby.
You work for me.
Poor babe.
Now I must give you away to give me...
my best chance.
You gave away the wrong child, Mother.
Soon, you'll see.
Soon.
No, no, no, no, no!
Well, isn't this nice?
W-W-What do you want?!
Why, you, of course.
You're going to help me create a very special spell,
one that no sorcerer has yet to achieve --
a time-travel spell.
I just need the ingredients --
symbols of innocence and love and courage and wisdom.
A symbol of innocence could be a baby, for instance,
and a symbol of wisdom...
could be a brain.
Your brain, to be exact.
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no!
Stop!
Dorothy?
Didn't I send you back to Kansas?
Well, witch...
...I'm back.
Those slippers.
They were supposed to be a one-way ticket home!
You left me no choice. I had to return.
When I got word that you were alive,
and had taken over Oz, I had to stop you.
You got word?
Munchkins.
I hate those mouthy, little vermin!
Let the Scarecrow go.
Yes.
Sorry.
Think I'll hold on to him.
You will never defeat me, Zelena,
because I have the most powerful weapon of all --
the love of the people.
Well, then...
No!
You'd think a desperate man would work a little faster.
Magic cannot be rushed.
Creating a portal is no simple task.
Yes.
Yes, I know.
But we don't have a dark curse
or a magic bean or silver slippers.
We have something better -- your Dark One-tainted blood.
It got you down here. It can reopen the portal.
Why do you even need a portal?
You can come and go as you please.
But I can't bring anyone back -- alive.
By combining our powers...
that can change.
And I don't care how painful it is for you.
So, if you want me to tear up this contract
so your child-to-be is your child-to-be...
...you won't care about the pain, either.
You must tell me where you want this portal directed.
Why, Storybrooke, of course.
Why, hello, little ones.
Did you sleep well?
Yeah?
Belle.
What are you doing here?
Uh, formula for the babies?
Of course. Here. I'll help.
Uh, the red one's hers.
Right.
I don't know where my head is today.
Uh, Mother Superior, what -- what's going on?
Nothing. Everything's fine.
No, it's not.
What --
Who are you?
Zelena.
You really are a clever girl.
No, no, no.
Regina sent you back to Oz. Ho-How did you --
All you need to know is that my sister can't keep me down.
I've come for my baby.
So, if you wish to remain alive, step aside.
Zelena's baby?
What do you want with her child?
Well, you of all people should know the value
of keeping your reasons your own.
I don't have to tell you anything.
And yet you keep doing so.
Some might call that the mark of an insecure man.
We're done here.
Get me Zelena's baby.
I'll rip up the contract,
and you can tell Belle she's pregnant
without also having to tell her
she owes her baby to me.
I hear new expectant mothers hate that.
Almost as much as they hate hearing
their husbands are still the Dark One.
Now do it.
Put her -- Put her down.
Or what?
You'll smite me with your book learnin'?
Oh, I have something more than that.
Please.
Neither of you would dare risk hurting my child.
No, you -- you don't want to hurt your baby.
No.
But I don't mind hurting you.
Okay. We'll see.
Stop it!
Stop it! You're endangering everyone!
It's not me that's doing it!
No!
Okay.
Where's the baby?
W-What happened?
How did we get out here?
My baby. My baby! Is she hurt?!
Oh, my magic!
Zelena, what did you do to us?
I didn't do anything! This wasn't me!
Okay, then, if it wasn't you, then who was it,
and -- and where are we?
And why is the sky red?
No, no, no!
What?
We're in the Underworld.
Okay.
Then, uh, t-then Rumple must need my help.
That's why we're here.
Wait.
Hades.
We're here because of me.
And now I know why -- my baby.
What?
Hades wants your baby?
Hand her over. Please.
No.
No, nothing good ever came of anyone trusting you.
Give her to me!
Belle, please! Give her to me! I can keep her safe!
Please!
Belle?!
Belle?!
So, I heard someone of the Munchkin persuasion
tipped off Dorothy that I was still alive.
Since you're all so fond of tattling,
I'll give you the chance to make it up to me.
Where can I find the Scarecrow?!
We don't know! We swear!
Fine.
Have it your way, Boq!
Did that loosen your bearded lips?
Or would you like to turn into a pile of ash, too?!
Now, now. No need to make more of a mess.
Who the hell are you?!
Who the hell am I?
That question is more appropriate than you know.
Please -- allow me to introduce myself.
I am Hades.
Really?
King of the Underworld?
Yes.
My reputation precedes me.
And to what do I owe this visit?
Your handiwork has impressed me.
You've sent so many my way.
That last headless guard --
You have panache.
True.
But I sense there's something else.
I heard a rumor that you're dabbling in time travel,
trying to achieve the unachievable.
It won't be unachievable for long.
Which is why I'm here.
I believe in you.
Is the devil flirting with me?
Yes.
Uh, I'm not the devil.
People are always conflating us.
No, I want to help you.
This Scarecrow -- he is one of the ingredients you need?
Yes.
And I had him until a meddling farm girl got in the way.
Dorothy.
You know her?
Well, I did my research before I came,
and from what I hear, she's a powerful woman.
So am I.
Yes, yes, I know. I know.
But she has one thing you don't --
the love of the people.
And pardon me for saying so, but no one loves you.
But there is a way to defeat her.
With an ally.
And what does Hades need with a time-travel spell?
All in good time, Zelena.
All in good time.
I don't need anyone's help.
We haven't ordered yet.
One dry wheat toast, one oatmeal.
I know the orders of all the regulars.
I'll get your cocoa.
What?
David, we're regulars.
We were only supposed to be here for a day,
and now we're regulars at the diner in hell.
Um, on the way to hell.
You know what I mean.
You're thinking about Neal.
I do, too -- all the time.
If only we could talk to him.
If he could just... hear our voices...
You can do that.
It's a simple Level 1 haunting.
Lots of people do it here until they lose interest
in life and people and...
joy.
I know where a booth is.
A booth? For haunting?
Where?
Oh, here and there.
What do you want?
Breathe into this.
The breath of the living buys a lot on the black market here.
Okay.
Um, the booth is by the bus stop.
Just pick up the phone
and tell the operator who you wish to haunt.
Happy haunting!
Let's go, Snow.
Let's talk to our boy.
Riveting tale.
Snow likes oatmeal.
Is my morning breakfast in there, too?
Henry, I thought you were gonna use your Author powers
to get us to defeat Hades.
I don't even remember writing this.
I just woke up and had it done.
Okay.
It's... really well-written.
Yes, and the illustrations are lovely.
Maybe if you focus harder...
So you're all Authors now?
Everyone's a writer.
Everyone's got an idea.
I'm doing my best.
Maybe if you just laid off for a little bit...
Henry, where are you going?
Upstairs.
Well, we officially have a teenager on our hands.
And a visitor in our Underworld apartment.
Zelena?!
So...
someone finally did you in.
Sorry to disappoint, but I'm very much alive.
Then how did you get here?
Through a portal.
And I didn't come alone.
Who else is here?
Our baby.
And she's in danger.
You again?
Is it your birthday?
I didn't know the king of the Underworld was so nosy.
I don't know the day I was born,
but thank you for reminding me.
That's actually a sad story.
I only know the day that my mother abandoned me.
Getting sadder.
So, this is, what, celebrating Abandonment Day?
I'm not celebrating anything!
Please go!
You know, when I offered to help you,
yes, it was coming from a place of self-interest,
but I really do think I can help.
You're thinking about your sister.
Aren't you?
How did you know that?
I know exactly how you feel.
She got everything you ever wanted.
And you got nothing.
Am I warm?
Yeah, you know how some people say
they look up to their older siblings like gods?
Well, my older brother is a god --
Zeus.
Ever hear of him?
He got everything he ever wanted.
He rules Mount Olympus,
while I'm trapped ruling the Underworld.
He stopped my heart.
Love, happiness, joy --
they've all been taken from me.
What I'm left with is only anger and a thirst... for vengeance.
I've survived on that for quite some time.
Only the kiss of... true love
can restart my heart and allow me to return
a fully formed man, free of this curse.
But... well...
true love, hmm?
No one is more hated than the Lord of the Underworld.
I could give you a run for your money.
Yeah.
Which is why...
we... must find your ingredients.
I know where this Scarecrow is.
Let me help you.
Let me help us.
If I can travel back...
I can see to it that it is me who winds up on Olympus
and my brother... who suffers.
Well.
You might just be as vindictive as I am.
Where are you going?
To find our daughter.
What about a tracking spell?
We don't have anything of the child's.
I don't need magic. I can find her.
I lived for years in the forest. I can track anyone.
I will find our daughter.
God.
What is this place?
Rumple.
Belle.
What are you doing here?
Y-Y-You're not -- Y-You didn't --
Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm -- I'm alive.
A portal brought me and -- and the baby
and... Zelena.
That's why the spell didn't work as I thought.
Brought over three bodies instead of one.
Well... you-- you did this.
Who were you trying to bring if not me
and you didn't know Zelena was back and --
No!
Why would you steal a baby?
No, no, no. It was -- It was Hades.
He used leverage to force me.
Look...
a long time ago, long before we even met...
I made a deal --
one I never thought would rear its head.
What did you do?
My boy was sick.
In exchange for Baelfire's life...
I made a deal to give up my second-born child.
But you don't have a second-born child.
It happened, Belle.
N--
I'm-- I-I'm pregnant?
W-We're gonna have a baby?
A-a baby --
a-a baby that you've already sold!
Yes, but -- but w-we can fix that.
I'll use all my power. W-We can fix this.
P-Power?
What --
You're the Dark One again.
No.
Yes.
See, the thing is...
...I love this dagger.
And I also love you.
Both are possible.
Look, y-you wanted me to be...
a better man.
A-A-And you've done that.
But if you want me to be a different man...
I'm sorry.
This is who I am.
You weren't always.
Yes, I was.
Even when I was a coward, I craved power.
The only difference is, now I have it.
And I won't let it go.
Not again.
Right.
Not even for me?
Belle, there's something you must realize.
Falling in love with the man behind the beast...
isn't really what happened to you.
You fell in love with me...
because there was a man and a beast.
Neither exists without the other.
No.
No.
I-I can't condone you being like this.
Not again.
Yes, you can.
You just have to choose to.
And if you do...
we can have what's important --
family, happiness.
It's your choice.
No, I'm, uh...
I'm not making any choices -- not now.
Not until you get me back to our friends...
and you've fixed... all of this.
Then that's what I shall do.
But you'll see I'm right.
You'll see.
I mean, how does this even work?
I don't know how much time it give us.
Do we just talk, or --
Oh! Maybe we should sing a little song.
He likes our singing.
I don't think it really matters.
I think it's just about Neal hearing our voices.
Yeah, but how does that work, anyway?
Does it go directly into his ears?
Does it repeat on a loop?
Uh, excuse me.
Do you know how this works -- I mean, on the other side?
No idea.
I don't even know if the messages get through.
I hope so.
Or I've wasted a lot of time these past 30 years.
All right, come on.
Okay.
Before we find my daughter,
would you do me the courtesy of sharing with me
whatever horrid name you've saddled her with?
Probably something dreadful like Brittany or Nancy or --
Oh, God, not Marian!
Zelena...
I haven't named our child
because I need to know her first to find out who she really is,
which I haven't been able to do
because I've been too busy protecting her from you!
You weren't protecting her at all!
You just left her so you could go on some heroic quest.
I mean, how is finding some pirate
more important than our child?
Helping friends, setting an example of heroism --
that is important!
You know, Zelena, I used to be just like you.
Oh, please. Don't flatter yourself.
When I was the Evil Queen,
I spent every day not giving a damn about anyone.
And in return, no one...
cared about me.
I thought all I needed was my vengeance
to keep me warm at night.
But then something happened.
My enemies...
became my family.
And that's when I finally felt happy.
That is why I'm here.
They need my help,
and when family needs help, you step up.
In case you've forgotten, there is someone I love
who needs my help -- my daughter!
So, if we could get on with finding her,
that would be just brilliant!
What are we doing here?
This is where Dorothy first landed in Oz.
Sometimes to find someone
...you need the right...tools.
What the hell is that?
Oh, right. They don't have these in Oz.
It's called... a bicycle.
And how is that contraption
going to help us find the Scarecrow?
Oh, well... here, hop on.
I'll show you.
Oh, please.
Trust me.
What is it?
Nothing.
Are you ready?
All right.
Hold on.
It's like a broom with wheels!
It's okay. I've got you.
Would you like to go again?
Yes, I'd like to go again!
Now...
tell me how this piece of tin
is gonna help me find my prey.
That loathsome farm girl must have him carefully hidden.
Simple -- this bicycle belongs to Dorothy.
Just enchant it, and it will take us right to her.
And the Scarecrow.
Belle?
It's okay.
Belle, is that you?!
You have her?!
Yeah, here. Yeah, she's fine.
Are you okay?
She's fine.
Are you okay?
Daddy's got you. Daddy's got you.
Thank you.
Yes.
Thank you.
Wait. What are you doing here?
Helping them.
She stole your baby.
My baby, which was stolen from me.
And now I'm helping.
It's all right, Belle. She won't hurt anyone.
But...
I've got a bottle. Give her to me.
No.
Give it to me. I'll do it.
I don't have any magic here, Robin.
The worst thing that can happen is some mother-daughter bonding.
It's all right. There's nothing nefarious in feeding.
Okay, fine.
As soon as she's done...
you're handing her back.
There, there, my little sweet pea.
There, there.
Are you hungry?
Yes, you are.
Your mummy knows exactly what you need, doesn't she?
Yes, she does.
Okay.
That's it. She's done.
Hand her back.
Now, Zelena.
No, sis.
Not now.
Not ever!
You...can do that?
You can talk to the real world?
Yes. Or...well, no.
I don't know.
Well, at least we tried.
I just need him to hear our voices.
He will.
As soon as we make it back home.
Emma, when will that be?
We went through this with you.
For all those years, if you had just heard our voices...
would that have made a difference,
knowing someone out there loved you?
Oh, this won't do!
It's okay.
It's okay.
I'm gonna find us a safe place, yeah?
What is it, sweet pea?
Oh, no.
Oh, no, it's okay. Let Mummy fix it.
My magic did this.
I did this.
I'm sorry.
There she is.
Go on.
This Dorothy's no match for you.
I've seen many powerful women in my day,
but none as brilliantly wicked as you.
Or clever or witty.
Or beautiful.
Go on. You've got this.
All right.
If that Kansas brat gets in my way,
we'll see what gingham
looks like with blood spatter.
Give him back!
Oh, no!
Back off, Witch! You're not taking him from me!
Yes!
Yes, I will.
What did you do?!
No, no, no!
I won't let you win!
It's too late.
I'm not afraid of you.
Do your worst,
but I will never be afraid of you.
Not sure where all this back-talk is coming from.
What happened to you in Kansas?
Actually, I don't really care,
because we're finished.
You see, I don't need to kill you,
and, believe it or not, I don't want to.
Because I want every Munchkin, every Quadling,
every good witch and bad of Oz to know that
the great Dorothy Gale can't protect them.
They need to know that you failed, and then...
then, my pretty...
you'll have nothing.
Hades?
Hades, you were right! She...
Hades?
Zelena?!
Are you in there?!
Zelena, enough!
It is not safe for you or our child out here!
Zelena!
Zelena!
I'm right here.
It's all my fault.
I can't protect her.
Not down here.
Not from him.
You need to tell us exactly what happened with you and Hades.
He wants to use her...
for a spell.
For my time-travel spell.
He's got the same thirst for vengeance as I do.
You know, he had love in his heart.
But because of me, it's gone.
And she's the ingredient.
Symbol of innocence.
Take her.
What?
Take her.
You can protect her, and I can't.
My magic's unpredictable.
I don't care if you never let me see her again!
You have to save her. Regina, please!
It's more important than what happens to me.
We'll do everything we can to protect her.
Goodbye, little one.
Mummy has to let you go.
She has your eyes.
So, does she have a name yet?
No. Not yet.
I can't.
Hades can do things with names.
Like put them on tombstones to keep people from leaving here.
I don't even think it's wise to keep her in this apartment.
I mean, what if Zelena changes her mind?
I hate to be the one to offer optimism,
but it sounds like she was sincere.
She was, but that doesn't mean what she knows
can't come back to bite us.
Robin's taking her to the forest.
Honestly, it's the only place I've ever felt really at home.
It happened!
It happened again!
Take a look.
Snow, look at this.
It's Neal.
Why did you write this?
It's like before.
I didn't, or I just don't remember.
It just... wrote itself.
Like it does.
"The infant son of Snow White and Prince Charming
looked up at the tiny glass unicorns
as they stirred by the wind.
But on this night, he didn't hear the chime of the crystal.
Instead, he heard the voices of his mother, Snow White,
and his father, Prince Charming.
They sang a lullaby until he fell asleep
as soundly as if he were in their arms."
He heard us.
He heard us.
Thanks, Henry.
I don't know about anyone else,
but I am really ready to get back home to my family --
my whole family.
No more waiting.
We can save ourselves.
We're going to take down Hades, and we're going to do it now.
There you are.
What's this?
Dinner.
To celebrate.
You saw?
Of course I saw.
You were wonderful.
I knew you'd succeed.
Come. Sit.
So...
is this also a farewell dinner...
...before you return?
No.
I'm not going back to the Underworld, Zelena.
But you said you needed...
Yes.
So, you think that you and me are...
True love.
You can't tell me you don't feel something, too.
Yes, but we just met.
I know, I know.
But when we were on that bicycle...
...and I had my arms around you...
I felt something I haven't felt in eons.
My...
My heart...
fluttered.
Just for a moment.
And I truly believe...
once we kiss...
my heart will start again.
I'll be free.
And we can be together.
No!
No? What?
How could I be so stupid?!
What -- What are you talking about?
I almost believed you.
It's the truth. I promise!
You want me to kiss you to free you from the Underworld!
And then you'll have the power to steal this brain
and enact my time-travel spell -- for you!
And only you!
Because that's what I would do.
No.
You want revenge and until you get it,
you will never be satisfied.
You need this spell.
You need to go back to beat your brother,
just like I need to go back to beat my sister!
Love is not enough!
No, Zelena. I don't want that anymore.
I want you.
I love you.
No one could love me.
But if you did...
you wouldn't want to take away my best chance at revenge.
Go back to your brimstone.
I never want to see your face again.
You will regret this...
Zelena.
Hello, Hades.
Zelena.
You know, I was looking for you.
You were looking for my baby.
I was just a happy accident.
Yes. Yes, you were.
But when I heard you fell through my little portal...
I really was looking for you.
I know.
I thought I'd make it easy.
I know that you want my child for your time-travel spell.
If you touch her, I will demolish you!
There's no need for that.
I wouldn't hurt you.
I never would've hurt you.
That's the thing about true love.
I-It endures. It can't be broken.
What?
So, sending Rumplestiltskin after my daughter
had nothing to do with revenge on your brother?
Zelena.
I was trying to rescue her from those miserable heroes for you.
I didn't know you were there.
Despite everything I've done, you've loved me all this time?
Look around you.
I mean, aren't you curious why this -- this place...
looks like Storybrooke?
I did it for you!
I saw how much you wanted to cast the dark curse
to get everything your sister had.
You made me my very own Storybrooke?
I gave you what you wanted, what she had.
It's not...perfect.
The Underworld is a place of... well, destruction.
Despite my best intentions, things don't grow here.
They... decay.
But it's our decay.
Zelena...
wouldn't it be nice...
to not be alone... anymore?
After all these years, I still choose you.
What better revenge is there than having it all?
But I had it all.
And then I gave them back my baby
because I thought that you wanted to hurt her!
Well, then, we'll just have to go back
and get her, won't we?
No!
No!
I-I want to trust you. I do.
But you still can't. I understand.
I'm sorry.
It's too much.
I will get my daughter back.
And I'll do it all on my own.
April 15th.
What?
Your birthday.
Just thought you might want to know.
How do you know that?
Tortured it out of a miller's daughter.
Don't worry.
I took care of her, too.
For you.
I know you don't need me.
You don't need anyone.
But if you change your mind...
and decide you want me...
I'll be waiting for you...
at home.
Just like I always have.
