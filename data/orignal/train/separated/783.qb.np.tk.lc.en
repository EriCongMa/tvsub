that is how you have sex in america .
what &apos;s happening here is amazing .
like i wanna film it , but i don &apos;t wanna film it , cuz that would be porn .
at that time , i think i figure it out
what that thing underneath the thing was .
yeah you did .
and whoa , right ?
yeah , whoa .
hey , should we take a break
and , like , talk about our childhoods or something ?
you know , get in there ,
get into it , get into each other &apos;s heads .
dreams , thoughts , fears , feelings .
if-- yeah-- i mean ...
no ?
i &apos;m gonna throw a curveball .
i &apos;m gonna go banana it
and then i &apos;ll be ready for round two .
define &quot; banana it . &quot;
eat a banana ?
oh , good .
i was worried for a second .
oh , what are nick and jess doing in there ,
and how is it this loud ?
nick &apos;s body is so soft ,
it should absorb sound .
they &apos;re just getting warmed up , schmidt .
it &apos;s a whole new ball game around here .
you , see , you wouldn &apos;t know that
&apos;cause you haven &apos;t been here in weeks ,
but now that you &apos;re single ,
yeah , you got to deal with this , too .
dumped by two women in the same day , schmidt ,
that has got to be a record , man .
i get it , all right ? i lost two perfect women ,
but i &apos;m fine with it , all right ? i &apos;m fine .
you know , you could &apos;ve been perfectly happy with either
one of them , but now you &apos;re by yourself .
winston , i &apos;m fine . please .
that really has to hurt .
this is my home , too .
i shouldn &apos;t have to be faced with their stupid ,
happy relationship everywhere i look .
this is going to stop , winston ,
and i &apos;m gonna stop it .
well , my advice to you is to stay in your foxhole ,
keep your head down and invest in one of these babies .
watch your butt , furguson .
this is my survival kit . check this out , man .
blindfold ,
get this bell wrapped around my neck
so he can hear when i &apos;m coming .
every couple has a weakness .
kate and will , i could break them up with one e @-@ mail .
oh , look at that , look at the royal baby now ,
living with slutty aunt pippa .
i &apos;m telling you , they &apos;re bulletproof .
i &apos;m sorry , um ,
i have to show nick something in the bathroom .
yeah , it &apos;s tiles .
i &apos;m so bad at lying .
it &apos;s for sex .
oh , go ! go make love in our communal shower .
enjoy it now , you little bunnies .

第三季 第四集
i like your chewing face .

i know it &apos;s super annoying to be around a couple .
not me at all ; it &apos;s him .
look at him .
yeah , we had a tough day today
at the v @-@ e @-@ t .
yeah , they said he &apos;s gonna have to get ...
it rhymes with &quot; fleutered . &quot;
the word is neutered .
cats don &apos;t speak english .
furguson &apos;s never gonna experience actual , physical lovemaking .
do you think you &apos;re a little too into your cat ?
he should be out there ,
just getting all crazy ,
getting his freak on .
i feel bad , man ; i don &apos;t know what to do .
let &apos;s try to help ; we got three smart people here .
we all know we got to get furguson laid , right ?
right .
cat bachelor party .
that &apos;s right .
what do you think ?
yeah , get some little cat strippers .
big booty cats , little booty cats .
some tabbies .
some black ones , some white ones .
yeah .
we &apos;ll mix it up .
get us a couple siamese , get weird with it .

you know we &apos;re kidding ?
we &apos;re kidding .
sure , sure , sure , sure .
gotcha .
it &apos;s happening .
oh , look , it &apos;s you and you .
is that a cake ?
why do you have a sheet cake ?
don &apos;t eat the cake , jess .
what is that ?
like , vanilla and vanilla ?
i just wanted to wish you guys
a happy one @-@ month anniversary .
hip hip .
you said you wanted to break us up .
you said you didn &apos;t care if it took your whole life .
look , i understand that i &apos;m not exactly
your favorite person right now ,
but i didn &apos;t want a milestone in your relationship like this
to @-@ to go uncelebrated .
you &apos;re really great together .
i don &apos;t trust him .
i know ; it &apos;s schmidt we &apos;re talking about .
after he saw the movie titanic ,
he started the billy zane fan club .
what ?
look it up .
they &apos;re called the zaniacs .
why does that make me angrier
than anything he &apos;s ever done ?
i will handle this . okay .
and i &apos;m gonna test this cake ,
i &apos;ll handle this .
because i &apos;m so mad at schmidt .
hey , dummy ,
why &apos;d you get us that cake ?
come on , man , i &apos;m just happy for you .
looking at a @-@ a month ?
a big month , man .
how many relationships have you had
that have lasted more than a month ?
i don &apos;t know , some .
probably very few , probably very , very few , right ?
i mean , you think it &apos;s less than two ?
one , it &apos;s caroline , you know .
one ? are you kidding me , man ?
it &apos;s insane , that &apos;s so few ,
but i guess you only need one , right ?
the one . too soon ?
i &apos;m really happy , schmidt .
you should be , man .
look at you , you &apos;re like a different guy .
usually at this point ,
you &apos;re overthinking and anxious
and panicky and overthinking
and overthinking .
and distant and nervous and sweaty
and overthinking .
you &apos;re trying to get in my head , and it &apos;s not gonna work .
who could , man ? look at you .
you &apos;re cool as a cucumber .
you &apos;re obama on the ski slopes .
now , get out there .
enjoy that cake with the woman that you love .
too soon ? forget about it .
good talk .
yeah .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
looks like we have a little groundhog day situation .
please don &apos;t call it a groundhog &apos;s day situation .
six more weeks of winter .
don &apos;t worry .
lie back .
i &apos;m gonna take care of this .
this has never happened in my whole life ,
just so you know .
it &apos;s cool , what can i do to help ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe think outside of the box ?
a little chicken kabob
with rice .
choice of naan or chutney .
how about we ...
oh , i had it .
reverse psychology .
i &apos;m not attracted to you .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re sexy .
don &apos;t want to have sex with you .
okay .
i think you &apos;re a fat , fat , fatty , fat ...
okay !
oh , yeah .
papa smurf ? really ?
whole body .
are you sure ?
yes , hey .
okay .
this will work , let &apos;s do it .
okay .
okay .
well , at least the sun managed to get up .
i have to go move my car .
i &apos;m kidding .
but i &apos;m kidding !
are we not kidding about this ?
does she have all her shots ?
yep .
okay , cool , cool .
um , let me ask you this .
uh , does she strike you as , um , i don &apos;t know , slutty ?
excuse me , i &apos;m here to pick up fatty from her grooming .
oh , there you are .
who are you here to pick up ?
well , actually ,
uh , my boy cat is looking for a girl cat .
well , i might know a girl cat
who &apos;s looking for a boy cat .
oh , yeah ?
does the girl cat have all her parts ?
yeah .
yes ?
uh , okay . well , um , i don &apos;t know ,
maybe , uh , she could come over sometime ?
like , our cats could go on a date ?
yes , you get it .
you know , everyone else thought i was being weird .
so , um , how often do you groom your cat ?
so i talked to my mom about it ,
and my dad ...
i &apos;ve got to go move my car .
hey , no , it &apos;s important we talk about these things .
nick , it &apos;s ...
i &apos;m moving my car !
hello .
whew , nick looks exhausted .
you guys obviously had a good night .
yeah , um ,
i ... we didn &apos;t sleep much .
well , of course you didn &apos;t , you mangy little stray .
i really don &apos;t want to talk about it ,
especially not with you , schmidt .
i know ,
and look , i also realize that it &apos;s gonna be a long time
for me to regain your trust .
i just think it &apos;s sad
because if you did have a nick problem ,
i probably could help you out .
you know , my diploma says that i majored in communications ,
but my heart says
that i majored in nicholas studies .
i &apos;m just saying .
i love the morning .
anything &apos;s possible .
the whole day &apos;s ahead of you , you know ?
last night , nick struggled with impotence .
oh , my god , i &apos;m not talking you about this .
jess , look , i get it . you don &apos;t want my help ,
but just do me a favor please .
let me know when you &apos;re not mad at me anymore
so i can tell you about
how men crave danger and variety in their sexual lives .
i just hope it &apos;s not too late , fingers crossed .
what are you talking about ?
i mean , i don &apos;t care ,
but if i did ... theoretically .
theoretically , i would tell you
for @-@ for a man whose midsection is basically mush ,
nick has had a lot of sex .
he &apos;s pushed that mush all over town .
and you know what , he &apos;s got some very weird taste .
dark , real fringe stuff .
he likes stuff
that they don &apos;t even have porn for .
what ?
and you know , a lot of women
wouldn &apos;t think to do the captain
in @-@ in bed .
what ?
that was a mistake , i shouldn &apos;t have said anything .
what ?
i didn &apos;t want to talk about the captain .
it was a thing , and i did and ...
do you want a smoothie ?
what &apos;s the captain ?
well , it starts off with ...
but you want to clean yourself up immediately .
i mean immediately .
and then you ...
how comfortable are you with racial slurs ?
then you ...
that &apos;s basically it .
that &apos;s what nick wants in bed ?
yeah , i know . look , you &apos;re probably not up for it .
it &apos;s my ... it &apos;s my fault .
it &apos;s very degrading , it &apos;s offensive , and you ,
you just don &apos;t have the time to learn all those dolphin sounds .
are you sure you don &apos;t want some of this smoothie ?
it &apos;s straw @-@ bana .
okay , furguson , this is a big moment in your life .
all right , just be yourself , you dawg .
winston , i think i found a way to ...
you want to try some catnip ?
this is a real bummer .
ahoy , nicholas .
wait , i &apos;m scared !
i &apos;m so glad you could make it .
oh , thanks . let &apos;s , um ,
let &apos;s head to my room .
oh , you &apos;re not wasting any time .
you know , it &apos;s just that i have very judgy roommates , you know ,
that might get a little weirded out if they walked in the room
and saw something they weren &apos;t supposed to see .
oh , or it &apos;s whatever , whatever fatty wants .
what do you want , fatty ?
fatty wants to see your room .
that &apos;s awesome . great news . you hear that , furguson ?
y &apos;all go play . yeah ? there you go .
he was nervous .
well , good thing i brought this .
yeah , we can &apos;t give wine to these cats .
it &apos;s been a tough six months , and this cat needs a drink so ...
o @-@ okay .
i don &apos;t think they care .
they &apos;re not listening at all .
they &apos;re too into each other . yeah .
nick , we have to talk about this , okay ?
all right , i &apos;ll go first .
listen ...
i was uncomfortable with some of the specifics
of what we just did .
for example , when i said , &quot; you like that , huh ? &quot;
i felt like you really , really didn &apos;t like it .
how do you feel ?
i just ...
i feel like , you know ...
no , it &apos;s just kind of like ... be ... i mean ...
it was good , you know . it &apos;s over .
love sleeping birdstlye .
i just want to know what i did wrong .
how does the captain normally go ?
the what ?
the captain .
what we just did .
i &apos;ve never done that in my life .
we did that because you wanted to , jess .
what ? !
yeah .
why would i want to do that ?
that &apos;s degrading to not only women but all of mankind , nick .
i know .
i only did that
cause schmidt told me it was your favorite thing .
did you say , &apos; cause schmidt said ?
no , no , no , no did you just ...
don &apos;t ...
did you talk to ... tight pants and eyebrows ...
who was i supposed to talk to , nick ?
every time i tried to talk to you
about your penis problems , you went to move your car .
those aren &apos;t penis problems .
what is ... did you talk to winston about my penis problems ?
what about cece , did she get a call ?
he wasn &apos;t around .
schmidt told me he had a phd in nickology .
he doesn &apos;t . there &apos;s no such ...
we have to talk about our feelings &apos; cause we &apos;re together .
if we needed to talk about feelings ,
they would be called &quot; talkings . &quot;
no , that is not true . nick ...
that is 100 % ...
this is it ...
this is schmidt getting in our heads .
i &apos;m going to kill him !
jessica , wait .
schmidt !
i can &apos;t run that fast-- the captain !
i trusted you . you took advantage of me .
no , no , don &apos;t do this .
something wrong ?
you set us up .
i &apos;ve done things to nick i can &apos;t ever undo .
you see , your fatal flaw-- communication .
you won &apos;t shut up about your feelings , and the only thing
this dummy wants to talk about is the chicago brown bears .
it &apos;s just the chicago bears . there &apos;s no brown ...
who cares ?
i put a pebble in your path and the two of you
cracked your tiny little skulls on it .
ooh , by the way , how was the captain ?
did you make it all the way to the spyglass ?
yes , schmidt !
and my night vision &apos;s very good
&apos;cause my eyes are so buggy and big
and i saw everything and i can &apos;t erase it from my memory .
please , jess , stop talking about the captain .
why don &apos;t we just go back to being roommates . okay ?
nick , what do you say ?
the floor is yours . you want to tell us how you feel ?
me ?
yeah .
well ... i think it &apos;s ...
i just ...
beautifully said . thank you , nick .
enjoy your breakup .
if you need me , i &apos;ll be in my room
listening to mainstream hip @-@ hop .
stop !
i have feelings .
i didn &apos;t like when you did the captain .
it made me feel ...
... bad .
okay , i &apos;ve ... i &apos;ve never seen this sober before .
stop , it &apos;s my turn .
you talk too much and it frustrates me .
sometimes you talk even after you &apos;ve fallen asleep .
how do you breathe ? where do you get the words ?
but it doesn &apos;t matter , jess , because i like you a lot .
but maybe do that less , okay ?
nick , i just feel ... sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
just ... keep going .
i don &apos;t know . um ...
i really like the instrument of the cello .
i like the cell a lot , and i don &apos;t talk about it a lot
but i should because i feel very passionate about it .
it &apos;s a beautiful instrument .
it &apos;s like a guitar but it stands up .
i once saw a zebra
named gavin give birth at the zoo ,
and i cried hysterically .
and then i bought one of those stretched out pennies
that you can get to remember it
and then i lost that and i cried again .
sometimes when i smell dust
in like an attic or something , like that mothy , dusty ,
i think about my mother .
when i was 14 , i saw my mother change ,
and i saw her whole body naked without underpants on .
i really like when a rap song uses a choir .
it makes me feel really happy when all those ladies &apos; voices
come in and then the guy &apos;s rapping .
i think it &apos;s awesome .
i &apos;m really proud of you , nick .
i really like you
i like you , too .
and it &apos;s been a month and i &apos;m not scared .
unless you &apos;re doing the captain ,
and then i experience very real fear and it &apos;s very visceral ...
just kiss me .
no kissing in the living room !
no . no , no , no ! no , no , no , no , no !
cease lovemaking !
all lovemaking must cease .
get out of here , schmidt !
break up !
just break up already , pl ... oh , forget it .
i &apos;m just ... i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m ...
no , no !
hey , no , no .
what are you doing ?
oh , my god , he just hit my sack .
body block !
i &apos;m pure core . i &apos;ve been training for this .
yeah , human dental dam .
so ...
what do you do for fun ?
you know , like all good things .
like what ? tell me one thing .
i &apos;m sorry , do you hear noise ?
do you hear shouting ?
cause i &apos;m just ...
yeah .
no . no , no , no , no , no .
who the hell mess up the mood ? !
schmidt , schmidt .
put down my condoms .
pull it together , schmidt .
it &apos;s raining celibacy . hallelujah .
you &apos;re losing it , man .
if i &apos;m not having sex in this loft ,
nobody &apos;s having sex in this loft .
my birth control pills .
you don &apos;t want to do this , my man .
yes , i do want to do this .
it &apos;s the only way to get this place back
to the way that it was .
put them down . give them to me .
give them to jess .
come on , buddy , it &apos;s not worth it .
no fear !
monday tuesday wednesday
oh , my god .
why didn &apos;t you just throw them in the sink , you idiot .
you better pray that was a placebo week .
is he eating birth control pills ?
friday ! full wheel , bitches !
i win . i don &apos;t feel good .
guys , come on , our cats were just about to have sex .
oh , my god .
oh , my god , this whole time i thought ...
what ?
fatty , come on .
we &apos;re out of here .
so , what do you guys think , loft meeting in 20 ?
yeah , i &apos;ll be there in 15 .
got to stick my head in a paper bag
and scream at the top of my lungs .
oh , yeah , there &apos;ll be no snack .
schmidt , i just looked it up .
there &apos;s no way estrogen works that fast .
you don &apos;t know my body .
please , stop talking about your body , schmidt .
okay , that &apos;s a good segue ...
to some of the more relevant topics
that i would like to cover in this meeting .
like , uh , personal space .
public space .
other people &apos;s medicines--
taking them versus not taking them .
i am so aware of my nipples right now .
okay , that &apos;s a good start .
if someone were to blow on my nipples ,
i would positively scream .
boundaries .
any takers ?
all right , we live here .
where are we supposed to go ?
this is my fault .
&apos;cause i &apos;m going through a sexual awakening .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m tapping into
this raw sexual energy
that the universe is putting forth .
and it &apos;s just both imploding and exploding at the same time .
and it &apos;s kind of like i &apos;m a young nun .
and nick is my sexy monseigneur .
and i &apos;m a ...
i &apos;m just going to shut up .
both of you need to shut up , okay ?
you &apos;re having sex , not inventing .
it can &apos;t be that good .
it &apos;s good .
stop saying , &quot; squeeze my biscuits . &quot;
i &apos;m serious , nick .
sorry .
and , schmidt ,
stop taking it out on everybody else , man .
deal with your breakups .
ain &apos;t no way in hell i got a cat brothel
going on in my room and i &apos;m the only normal person in this loft .
you did a bad thing .
deal with it .
what &apos;s that ?
oh , it &apos;s just what i needed .
this gum is crap .
you ready ?
what is it ?
just keep your eyes closed .
all right , stand right there , okay ?
okay .
turn around .
i love it .
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t know what it is .
all right , then yell something .
i soundproofed it .
what &apos;s wrong ? i just heard yelling .
get out of here , man .
he must ... he must &apos;ve literally been right by the door .
it is soundproofed-- that &apos;s what the egg crates are for , so ...
nick , i just want to say something . um ...
this last month ... has been the best month of my life .
me , too .
i &apos;ve never , you know , felt this way
or had this with anybody .
it &apos;s like there &apos;s been this fog around my life ,
and with you , all of a sudden it &apos;s gone .
i love that you can express your feelings now .
yeah , it &apos;s a weird feeling .
it &apos;s kind of like gross but also good .
you know ? it &apos;s like an egg broke .
and then , like , all the yolk comes out
but it &apos;s good .
i &apos;m happy to admit i like love songs .
i understand them .
they &apos;re really sad .
they &apos;re mostly about either the girl or the guy got away .
they &apos;re heartbreaking numbers .
the air-- do you feel it ?
i guess this is the air you breathe , but it &apos;s nice .
i feel like i &apos;m on this whole new planet .
how about your two ...
favorite planets ?
oh , yeah , those are great .
but i also feel like being with you ,
i &apos;ve finally , for the first time ,
i know this sounds crazy , but i can see the stars .
you know , the great other thing about talking about our feelings
is we don &apos;t need to do it all the time .
thank you for expressing that .
i feel like i can see you uh @-@ huh .
in 3d vision .
everyone see in 3d .
so , would you like to take my bra off , or should i ?
see , i feel excited to take your bra off .
so , do it .
i love your breasts .
just mixing it up with those two things .
i &apos;m not even nervous to do it .
so , do it .
