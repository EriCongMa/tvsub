okay , here &apos;s the number for poison control .
ask for carol .
honey , we &apos;re gonna be fine .
enjoy your reunion .
oh , it &apos;d be a lot more fun if you were there .
i really am sorry about that .
i just can &apos;t miss the chance to bowl on jay &apos;s team .
that &apos;s why i ordered these glide rights .
if you break &apos;em in properly , they &apos;re supposed to give you
a completely frictionless--
if i &apos;m being honest , the reunion might be a little more fun
if phil isn &apos;t there .
otherwise , i spend the whole weekend telling him who &apos;s who
and explaining inside jokes .
and if all that explaining is going out ,
the alcohol is not going in .
hey , mom . before you go , you have to sign this for school .
you don &apos;t have to read it . it &apos;s all boilerplate .
honey , i am running really late . ask your dad .
right here , buddy .
s--uhh !
i have to get the letter signed
because i failed my assignment on the revolutionary war .
i recreated the battle of bunker hill
using one of my old science projects .
seemed pretty revolutionary to me .
the brave patriots made their way up the hillside ,
prepared for whatever the devious red coats might inflict next .
now you work ? !
so , dad ...
one second , buddy .
the salesman said when you &apos;re breaking these shoes in ,
it &apos;s easier to move side to side .
son of a gun .
he was right .
what do we got here ?
i &apos;ve waited a year for this day--
the annual trade association scratch bowling tournament .
last year , we lost to our biggest rival .
frazier had ali .
pritchett &apos;s closets has closets , closets , closets , closets .
it &apos;s a stupid name , but those cats can bowl .
ay , i knew the pancakes would bring you down .
just coffee for me today .
black , like i feel on the inside .
ay , manny . please , it was only one bad audition .
no , three bad auditions--
fall assembly , &quot; phantom , &quot;
and now the spring sing .
i &apos;m a disaster .
you &apos;re always so dramatic .
dramatic , mother ?
i am sure that cam is gonna call you today
and give you the solo .
you &apos;re always so hard on yourself .
remember that you said that you didn &apos;t have a face for hats ?
and ?
i look great in every hat .
i can &apos;t hear you .
i look great in every hat .
well , enjoy that while it lasts .
i had a pretty good hat run ,
but then i saw a photo of myself from the dude ranch .
i looked like reba at the grammys .
i see that you found the fur .
yes . uh , you wouldn &apos;t happen to have a feather boa , would you ?
are you wearing that to your oscar party ?
no , manny . we &apos;re not cliches .
cam &apos;s decorating the party
with photos of lily dressed as different starlets from the--
w @-@ we--we &apos;re cliches .
hey , gloria ,
look what i found in my bowling bag .
second place prize in last year &apos;s tournament--
a spa day .
oh , but it expires today .
oh . sorry .
i just wish that i could use this .
but today &apos;s the nanny &apos;s day off ,
and i have a million things to do .
i have to buy diapers , i have to go pick up the stroller ,
i have to go to the doctor .
i hate wasting this , but ...
i just don &apos;t have any time today .
yes , i would have loved to go to the spa ,
but having a baby has changed completely
the way that jay &apos;s family look at me .
i am not anymore just gloria that has her hair done ,
gloria that goes to the gym .
now i am gloria the new mother--
the &quot; i don &apos;t know how she does it &quot; lady .
if the feather boa is not here ,
it &apos;s at my cousin &apos;s .
i will go get it after the doctor , after the pharmacy ,
before the baby store , okay ?
honestly , gloria ,
i don &apos;t know how you do it .
ah , found it !
help me .
careful .
oh , gloria ! are you all right ?
ay , i told you to help me !
i am so sorry !
i twisted my ankle .
okay . sit down right here .
i don &apos;t have time for this .
no , you--you can &apos;t walk around on that all day .
no , i &apos;m good . i &apos;m good .
no . i will use ...
the baby carrier as a ... as a cane . okay ?
o @-@ okay .
now hold that . hold that . good , good , good .
now smolder . smolder .
perfect . perfect .
let me guess--
you couldn &apos;t remember if i said &quot; boa &quot; or &quot; baby , &quot;
so you brought both .
gloria hurt herself ,
and it was kinda my fault , so i offered to watch joe .
can i take a break ? i wanna be alone .
okay , where was that attitude when we were doing greta garbo ?
okay , fine . take five .
hi , baby joe .
why don &apos;t you just sit a spell ?
we &apos;re just makin &apos; pictures .
why are you being all missouri ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess i &apos;m excited to go back to the farm .
is it that obvious ?
you said &quot; dagburn &quot; at breakfast .
have you booked our tickets yet ?
you know , i @-@ i &apos;m not sure if i can get off work .
yeah , but you have to get the tickets
before all the good seats are taken .
you mean the ones that aren &apos;t on a plane to missouri ?
okay , sweetie , break &apos;s over .
it hasn &apos;t been five minutes .
yes , but it has been five animal crackers .
which is five too many to eat on a shoot day . so ...
no more ! i quit !
oh , my gosh . what has gotten into her ?
we &apos;ve been doing this for six hours ,
and now all of the sudden , she doesn &apos;t love it ?
you know , i have a theory .
okay .
well , we &apos;re only halfway through
all the pictures that i wanted to do .
lightbulb . hello , baby joe !
well , you may as well be
a dead hobo in the woods of a small town after a rainstorm ,
because you have just been discovered .
i &apos;m looking less and less forward to this trip to missouri .
hey , handsome .
uh , can you sign this ? you don &apos;t need to read it .
never do !
right there .
oh . quick--nature &apos;s sure @-@ fire sunburn remedy ?
aloe ?
hey , jay . super excited about our big match .
i dreamt about it last night .
guess what ? we won !
phil , i like you too much to sugarcoat
what i &apos;m about to say-- you &apos;re off the team .
good one . loosen me up with some pre @-@ match humor .
i like it .
nah , i found somebody better-- rudy sorrenson .
he &apos;s in , you &apos;re out .
hilarious !
stickin &apos; with the bit .
i love that this is our relationship now .
this match is too important , and you &apos;re a wild card .
i &apos;m sorry .
jay ...
i &apos;m not sure i like where this is headed .
phil , this is nothing personal . it &apos;s bowling .
no , no , no . i get it .
listen , um ... i should get goin &apos; .
my allergies are starting to cry .
hey , gloria . i was just about to leave .
what &apos;s up ?
manny just texted me . did he tell you the news ?
yes . wonderful . we &apos;ll celebrate later .
no . he didn &apos;t get the solo .
i think he &apos;s very upset .
my glove .
where are you ?
at the doctor . he &apos;s checking my ankle .
jay , i think you should try to cheer him up .
why don &apos;t you take him shopping ?
gloria , my match is at 5 : 00 .
i have a ritual .
i walk the lanes . i play two or three warm @-@ up games .
he &apos;s fine . i &apos;ll let you talk to him .
darkness , please .
aw , shoot . he &apos;s out in the pool .
what do i have to do to make you go away ? sing ?
uh , i &apos;ll have him call you back .
my life is a music @-@ less , gray hellscape .
wow . well , this doesn &apos;t look
like anything shopping can help you with .
it &apos;s worth a shot .
sorry i was so indecisive back there .
i &apos;m out of it today .
well , you got what you want ,
and that &apos;s what today is all about .
turn that frown upside @-@ down .
now you &apos;re gonna take this 15 local to get home .
keep both your hands tight on that bag
because it goes through a few sketchy blocks .
you &apos;re not driving me ?
well , you kinda used up your drive time
deciding between those identical belts .
okay . it &apos;s just hard . you know , jay ?
i mean , i &apos;ve never been a quitter .
well , new chapter for you . you got any change ?
i mean , i always imagined i &apos;d be a performer for life .
i guess some dreams you just have to give up on .
know when to fold &apos; em .
here &apos;s a $ 50 . someone will have change .
i can &apos;t sing , period .
what am i thinking ?
the 11 goes right by the house , and there she is .
now text your mom when you get home .
good luck with your bowling !
thanks , kid !
yes . yes !
we &apos;ve had my dad &apos;s baby for 45 minutes ,
and he &apos;s already in a dress .
okay , lily , i think we &apos;re ready for our most important setup--
miss shirley temple .
here .
oh , wow . you &apos;re an even better assistant than you are a model .
i don &apos;t care .
okay , well , that came through in her modeling .
our daughter .
okay , i know , but it just hurts , mitchell .
it &apos;s the first one of our things that she &apos;s outgrown .
well , you know , but isn &apos;t it great that we &apos;ve raised her
to have opinions and interests of her own ?
but this early ? she &apos;s still so daggum young .
okay , is that another southern thing ,
or are you just trying to remember her vietnamese name ?
oh , my gosh . this thing is stuck .
what ? how--how could it be ?
it is stuck .
oh !
i glued it .
w @-@ w @-@ why--why would you do that ?
because the jane crawford wig kept falling off him .
it &apos;s joan crawford .
&apos;cause that &apos;s what &apos;s important here .
okay .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s glued to his actual hair .
okay , lily ,
this is bad . this is very , very bad .
sorry . i was trying to help .
okay . well , i should &apos;ve seen this coming .
i replaced her with somebody younger ,
and she sabotaged joe &apos;s shoot out of sheer jealousy .
maybe she does have what it takes to be a model .
can you ...
sing !
what ?
i &apos;ve heard you sing in the shower .
you sing in the car with me . you never miss a note !
your problem is doing it around people . sing !
you want me to sing now ?
yeah !
it &apos;s all in your head !
when you get over that little stage fright ,
you &apos;ll never choke an audition again . sing !
* i &apos;ve been a puppet , a pauper *
* a pirate , a poet *
that &apos;s not singing !
attack it !
* a pawn and a king *
* i &apos;ve been up and down and over and out *
* and i know one thing *
what &apos;s that thing ? !
* each time i find myself *
* flat on my face *
yeah ! now you got it !
* i pick myself up *
get in that bag ! i know you want to !
* and get back in the race *
yeah !
* that &apos;s life *
* that &apos;s life *
sing it to me , baby !
* that &apos;s what all the people say *
oh , my god . is that janie gibbs ?
yikes . her skin looks like
crumpled tinfoil you try to smooth out and use again .
remind me not to get old in front of you .
i don &apos;t even see the kids &apos; faces anymore .
i know them by the decals on their laptops .
professor cooke .
still the sexiest man on campus .
wanna know a little somethin &apos; ?
you dated him .
how did you know that ?
we were so careful with that secret .
you wore an oversized tweed jacket to breakfast
and called my rabbit convertible &quot; bourgeois . &quot;
well , it kinda was .
we were so jealous of you .
he was so hot .
jogging around campus in those dolphin shorts .
and that wasn &apos;t even why i was with him .
it was his mind .
do you know those people
who make you feel smart
just by being near them ?
i watched you guys once .
claire !
claire &apos;s friend !
he remembers me .
hello , professor .
it &apos;s so good to see you .
clearly , the academic life agrees with you .
oh , i guess we &apos;re all doing pretty well .
cheers .
cheers .
here &apos;s lookin &apos; at you , too .
were you always like this ?
claire ?
oh , my god . no way .
tater ! oh , my gosh ! aah !
i heard you &apos;re hugely successful .
yeah , well , you know , when all the hot girls call you &quot; tater , &quot;
you tend to try a little harder .
adorable . adorable !
you &apos;re adorable !
claire !
honey ! hey !
hi , phil ! what are you doing here ?
uh ... your dad dumped me from his bowling team ,
so i thought i &apos;d surprise you .
okay . wait . come here a second .
i @-@ i thought you &apos;d be happy to see me .
i am ! no , i am !
i am happy .
is something wrong ?
it &apos;s just-- it &apos;s a little bit embarrassing .
the guy that i dated right before you is here , so ...
oh . well , that &apos;s nothing to be embarrassed about .
we all have exes .
so the guy you dumped right before you met me is here .
no big deal .
well ...
he might &apos;ve dumped me .
i thought you said you &apos;d never been dumped .
well ... maybe one time .
so ... he dumped you ,
you healed completely , and then you met me .
well ...
i &apos;ve regretted throwing away things way more beaten up than claire .
so if this campus casanova had thoughts of reclaiming her ,
guess what , hot shot ?
legally , i still own her .
man , i always wondered who &apos;d be lucky enough
to marry the beautiful claire pritchett .
no luck involved , hombre .
she saw , she liked ,
she got pregnant , she had to .
hey ! stop hogging this guy .
i haven &apos;t seen him in 20 years .
my tater .
look , i &apos;ve gotta run ,
but i &apos;d love to have you guys by my apartment
for a cocktail before dinner .
oh ! we are totally doing that .
oh . we might have to go back to the hotel--
no , no , no . ah , that &apos;s what this weekend &apos;s for .
having a laugh , meetin &apos; new people .
i don &apos;t want to miss any of it .
and i don &apos;t miss much .
close the door ! you &apos;re letting the steam out !
is the wig coming loose ?
oh , yes , mitchell . it &apos;s completely off his head .
we &apos;re just staying in here
because there &apos;s nothing babies and big guys love more
than 100 % humidity .
oh , my god .
do you realize what gloria &apos;s gonna do when she sees this ?
she punched me when i got manny that henna tattoo .
and not the side @-@ of @-@ the @-@ hand way that i do it .
this had rings and knuckles .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m working on a plan &quot; b. &quot;
or should i say ...
plan bieber ?
no .
no , i just gave him a little bit of a haircut .
give me the baby . i know .
yes !
i mean , that &apos;s the great part of my schedule .
we make it to europe almost every summer .
but i &apos;m sure you guys travel .
well , honestly , i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve been anywhere
without a water slide in 15 years .
that &apos;s funny .
she &apos;s mentioned esther , dougie ,
tripp , afro judy ...
the name &quot; tater &quot;
has literally never even come up once in the last 20 years .
oh , i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m surprised .
i was madly in love with her for four years ...
and i was basically invisible
until the day i choked on that tater tot .
wait . uh , i @-@ i thought you were her ex .
i wish .
oh ! so , phil , are you here all weekend ?
no .
well , that &apos;s too bad . i was gonna suggest some activities .
the palmer center is doing
a wonderful retrospective of impressionists .
oh . that is a shame .
that &apos;s a field i know quite a bit about .
phil . no .
uh , you can see the influence , can &apos;t you ,
of the , uh , early impressionists ?
the , uh ...
rich little ,
the frank gorshin ,
on the ... jimmy fallon , if you will .
he meant the painter kind .
yes .
freshen your drink ?
no . no , not done .
you &apos;d know if i was finished with something ,
and i &apos;m not .
just the one then .
yeah .
what are you doing ?
sorry . did i embarrass you in front of your ex @-@ boyfriend ?
yeah , i know about that .
because i told you . come on . you can &apos;t seriously be jealous .
phil , it was 20 years ago .
reign it in .
come on . you &apos;re embarrassing me a little .
fine , but do you deny that part of the reason
you wanted to come back here by yourself is that guy ?
i &apos;m not even sure it &apos;s a bad thing , claire .
we all wonder about the paths we didn &apos;t follow ,
but you could admit it .
well , you can &apos;t be mad at me if i do admit it .
i won &apos;t .
well , i &apos;m not ... admitting it ,
because i couldn &apos;t be happier than i am in my life with you .
but , mm ...
i mean ... maybe ...
a tiny part of me just wanted to sort of peek through the window
and ... see the life that might &apos;ve been .
never get tired of those three flights .
maggie !
say hi to everyone .
in a second , angel .
mama &apos;s had a day .
oh , i thought that was the bedroom .
you &apos;re in the bedroom , honey ...
and the living room and the study
and the gym .
mm . but anyway ...
listen to me . i &apos;m being rude .
how is everybody ? how &apos;s things ?
not too bad .
actually ...
no , i &apos;m literally asking you , how is it to have things ?
yep , right on schedule .
keep it down , ya hood rats !
maggie , you were once a student .
i remember .
that &apos;s when i boarded this little rocket ship to the moon .
phil , wait . thank you .
for what ?
everything .
i &apos;m not sure how that guy got to be a professor .
he &apos;d have to be pretty stupid to dump you .
hey , the party &apos;s starting ,
and there &apos;s a really good @-@ looking guy
i was hoping to do a little dancing with , so ...
you mean me ?
yes .
wait . before we go ,
are there any more exes i should know about ?
honey , what do you think i was like ?
hey , claire pritchett !
hey , dean stoller !
super quick story .
all right , it &apos;s not too late for plan &quot; c &quot; --
we drop the baby and run .
what ? no . you have to tell her what you did .
you scalped her baby .
i had to cut that wig off .
what did you expect me to do ?
he keeps pulling his hat off .
okay , well , you could &apos;ve let me do it .
i have 32 hours of vidal sassoon training .
what ? i left the program over creative differences . shut up .
hola !
hola !
hola !
oh ! there &apos;s my little angel .
how was he ?
uh ... there--there &apos;s a funny story here .
gloria !
forgot about that baby ...
and check out this one !
you beat closets , closets , closets , closets , closets ? !
we destroyed them !
and it &apos;s closets , closets , closets , closets .
what did i say ?
we went through this for a half @-@ hour yesterday .
i can &apos;t do it again .
nope . you &apos;re gonna have to tell her .
what ? why ?
because she has two new rings .
that--that &apos;s gonna take the meat right off the bone .
okay , cam , you take the fall for me ,
and i will go with you to missouri .
i &apos;ll even go for a whole week .
make it ten days .
okay , fine .
but i don &apos;t want to meet anything on monday
that i &apos;m gonna eat on friday .
oh , well , that &apos;s gonna happen .
oh ! my perfect angel !
you got this . you &apos;re good .
you know , gloria , do you remember
that chafing dish i lent you a couple months back
that you returned with a chip in it ?
every time that luke comes over ,
he takes things out of the attic and leaves them just ...
everywhere !
yeah .
well , you know , funny thing about that chafing dish
is it was my grandmother &apos;s , and it was given to her--
luke !
oh , hey , manny . glad i ran into you .
listen , i &apos;m gonna give you the solo .
really ? you must &apos;ve heard what happened to me today .
i feel confident now and i know i can do--
yeah , i don &apos;t care about , any of that stuff .
i just need you to tell you mom
that you gave your brother joe a haircut , okay ?
no problem . how bad could it be ?
anyway , i heard you need a letter from school signed .
i kinda nailed my declaration of independence replica .
forged every signature with this pen .
so ...
stop .
we have a deal .
i &apos;ll say i cut the baby &apos;s hair .
and you give me that cool pen .
what ? no . no , that &apos;s not what i was going to ...
a deal &apos;s a deal .
a thief , lily .
that &apos;s who ate my last piece of cake
that my mother send me specially from colombia .
it helps you make the milk .
such a cool trophy .
say , how &apos;d that new guy rudy sorrenson do ?
he was great .
it &apos;s funny how he has the same name
as one @-@ time pro bowler rudolph sorrenson ,
which would be against league rules .
well , i &apos;d find it funny .
jay , hurry up . you have to take the kids to the movie .
and why does the baby still have that hat on ?
he &apos;s going to burn up .
gloria , i have a confession to make .
i gave joe a haircut .
it &apos;s bad .
why would you do that ?
my dad used to cut my hair when i was a kid ,
and i thought it &apos;d be a nice way for the baby and me to bond .
but i just made a mess of things ...
like i ... make a mess of everything .
let me take a look at this .
ay , dios mio !
wow . it &apos;s really bad .
dad , why would you do that to your own son ?
he &apos;s just a baby .
plus you ate that cake .
okay , enough . leave him alone .
he could have invented some crazy story ,
but instead he decided to tell the truth .
that &apos;s what families do .
yes , it is .
right .
okay , go . go , go , go .
lily , sweetie , we &apos;re leaving ! come on !
i know that they expected me to go all colombian crazy .
but this was just another opportunity for me to show them
that i was not the superficial gloria that i used to be .
plus i was very relaxed after the day i had .
where are you ?
at the doctor . he &apos;s checking my ankle .
what ? did you think i was gonna throw away a whole spa day ?
i &apos;m coming , fulgencio !
why am i doing this again ?
dad &apos;ll get a kick out of it .
like when we were young and used to wear his shoes .
now get up and take a few steps .
did dad ask for this ?
no , but he &apos;ll love it . maybe dance around .
okay , now jump .
what kind of video is this ?
you know what ? i &apos;ve gotta go to work . i &apos;m sorry .
okay , thanks !
what the hell ?
