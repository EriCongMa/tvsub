i want you to go back over your work with a fine @-@ tooth comb ,
we &apos;re as protected as we can be .
every partner at this firm
goes over their work if i say so .
i &apos;m not every goddamn partner .
i made a deal with forstman .
this has got to be the most genius thing
you have ever done in your entire , wonderful , life .
forstman &apos;s insisting that i run the money
through switzerland and the caymans .
louis , that &apos;s illegal .
you didn &apos;t see the look on harvey &apos;s face
when he found out that i was the one who saved the day ,
and i am not gonna see
the look on his face when he finds out that i didn &apos;t .
there isn &apos;t enough money in the world for me
to ever trust you again .
listen to me .
i &apos;m--
no , you listen to me !
you &apos;re fired .
i can &apos;t .
rachel . rachel .
what the hell is this ?
a job offer .
i am going to tell mike what happened .
if you do this ,
you will be risking your whole life with mike .
i am risking it if i don &apos;t .
i heard .
how ?
amy .
why would she--
so that you wouldn &apos;t have to .
here .
shit .
i didn &apos;t even think about what would happen to her .
mike , you don &apos;t have to think about anyone
except for you right now .
i don &apos;t want to think about me .
all i &apos;ve done is let everyone down , including you .
you have not let me down .
you don &apos;t even know what i &apos;ve done .
whatever it is , it can &apos;t be as bad as--
as i think ?
rachel , i lost my job .
i lost the takeover .
i lost walter gillis his company .
i cut a deal to sell out the man
who gave me a chance in the first place .
and to top it all off ,
the guy who made me do that called me his guy
and then offered me a job .
so what does that make me ?
it makes you a human being .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
i don &apos;t either .
but we don &apos;t have to do anything tonight .
louis , you need to calm down .
i broke the law .
please keep your voice down .
why ? let any man judge me .
so says the good book .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
you know what ?
i think i know what the goddamn good book says .
listen to me .
you did what you had to do .
oh , really ?
well , that &apos;s not what you said when you found out .
you said , &quot; louis , that &apos;s illegal . &quot;
because i was trying to get you not to go through with it .
but you made a decision . i understand why .
and now that it &apos;s done ,
i &apos;m not going to let you beat yourself up about it .
yeah , well , you may not , but what do you think harvey
and jessica are going to do when they find out ?
louis , you have been a hero again and again .
and if the one time they actually treat you like one
you crossed a little line to get there ,
that doesn &apos;t make you horrible .
it makes you harvey .
you know what ? you &apos;re absolutely right .
and as of this second ,
i &apos;m going to start acting like the hero that i am .
hey , jerk @-@ off .
who do i have to blow to get some more nuts ?
it turned out he knew all about the crop reports .
you know what i did ?
i nailed him on six counts of mail fraud .
did you tell them the one about how you got your head
stuck up eric woodall &apos;s ass ?
excuse me for a second .
what the hell are you doing here ?
you think you &apos;re the only person who can have someone followed ?
you have no right .
oh , i have every right .
i just didn &apos;t need to hire someone
&apos;cause it turns out you come to the same shithole every night ,
telling the same stories to the same people
because you have no place else to go .
if you &apos;re thinking you can bait me into taking a swing at you ,
you might be right .
why don &apos;t you take a swing at this ?
oh , you &apos;re trying to bribe me now .
that &apos;s a certified letter outlining everything
that &apos;s happened since you started targeting me ,
every bullshit move you &apos;ve made .
it &apos;s not bullshit . it &apos;s an ongoing investigation .
and it &apos;s turned up bullshit ,
which i &apos;ve outlined for judge hopkins .
everything from targeting my clients to having me followed .
so now you have ten days to dispute my accounting of events ,
and when they &apos;re done , i expect to never see you again .
you don &apos;t know me that well .
sean , any time you want to put the badge down
and fight me man @-@ to @-@ man ,
you know where to find me .
how &apos;s the job hunting going ?
what do you want , forstman ?
oh , now that you don &apos;t want my money , it &apos;s forstman ?
no mister ?
what happened to the obsequious little shit
who approached me in a coffee shop with his hand out ?
he realized that you don &apos;t deserve any respect .
i don &apos;t need your respect .
i need an answer on my job offer .
thought i was pretty clear .
your mouth said one thing .
let &apos;s see what your eyes have to say .
a million dollars .
is this a joke ?
it &apos;s your signing bonus .
are you ready to come work for me now ?
thought i was an obsequious little shit .
you are , but so was i when i was your age ,
and look what happened to me .
you could make it ten million , charles .
i don &apos;t want your money .
i &apos;m not gonna make it ten million .
the offer is one ,
and that &apos;s where it &apos;s standing .
you have a day .
if you decide not to take my offer ,
i will know you &apos;re not only an asshole .
you &apos;re a fool .
let &apos;s go .
jessica .
to what do i owe the honor ? what can i do for you ?
louis , i am coming to you
because the question isn &apos;t what you can do for me ,
but what can i do for you ?
harvey and i were very impressed
by what you did with charles forstman .
i &apos;m impressed that you understand how impressive it was .
and since we couldn &apos;t figure out how best to show our gratitude ,
i &apos;m here to ask you what you would like .
i &apos;m sorry .
you want to give me ...
a reward .
anything i want ?
all you have to do is ask--
pearson , specter , litt .
excuse me ?
i think i was clear .
i want my name on the door . it can go third .
louis , named partner isn &apos;t something i can just hand out .
but you just said i saved the day .
you just said you saved the day .
i said we wanted to show our gratitude .
by telling me i get to choose whatever i want ,
except for the one thing i really want .
maybe i should have been more clear .
maybe you should have .
i mean , you &apos;re a goddamn lawyer , after all .
louis ,
then let me be clear right now .
i am giving you an opportunity
to accept a well @-@ deserved thank @-@ you with grace .
you can either take it ,
or you can turn it into a personal snub
and ruin all the goodwill
that you &apos;ve just earned with me and harvey .
the choice is yours .
can i get back to you on that ?
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
can i get back to you on that ?
that &apos;s all i can hope for you , louis .
so i just wanted to run through your schedule
for the rest of the week .
go ahead .
you &apos;ve got ellis at 4 : 00 today ,
mckinney at 10 : 00 tomorrow ,
chamberlain at 2 : 00,
and when should i pencil you in to go see mike ?
see him for what ?
to be a friend .
donna , as far as he &apos;s concerned ,
i sold him out to win the takeover .
i am the last person he wants to see right now .
and i would agree with all that ,
except for the fact that mike got fired .
what ?
when ?
last night .
and i wasn &apos;t gonna tell you
because you should be hearing it from him ,
but men are idiots ,
and they would rather be alone and miserable
than ever run the risk of being accused
of needing someone .
he has rachel .
who is the one person mike believes
will stand by him no matter what ,
which makes her the one person he won &apos;t believe
when she says he didn &apos;t completely fail .
how important is the meeting with ellis ?
he says it &apos;s urgent .
tell him i have to reschedule .
that &apos;s weird . i already did .
rachel or donna ?
who told you to check up on me ?
you don &apos;t think i &apos;d do that on my own ?
no , i don &apos;t .
well , i wouldn &apos;t have
because i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d need it .
then i found out you got fired .
so what ?
people lose their jobs every single day .
yeah , not people like you .
something &apos;s going on .
why &apos;d you get fired ?
you mean other than the fact
that i picked a fight i couldn &apos;t win ?
i don &apos;t care how it turned out .
you went 15 rounds on your first shot .
no way jonathan sidwell lets you go after that .
it was forstman , wasn &apos;t it ?
i only got his money if i agreed to cut sidwell
out of the deal .
and sidwell found out .
he didn &apos;t just find out .
forstman told him .
that son of a bitch .
yeah , there &apos;s more .
that son of a bitch has offered me a job .
mike , you can &apos;t do it , and you know it .
what choice do i have ?
i was an investment banker for ten minutes ,
and i blew the only deal i &apos;m ever gonna get near .
well , that sounds exactly like the kind of bullshit
forstman tells people to wrap them around his finger .
doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s not true .
yes , it does .
i could get you five interviews before tomorrow .
and how are you going to do that ?
by making five goddamn phone calls .
and what are you gonna say when they answer ?
you gonna tell them
i was a harvard @-@ educated lawyer working for you ?
because you do that ,
i might as well go back to being a fraud .
what if i can get jessica to take you back ?
what if you could bring my parents back to life ?
because both those things
have about the same chance of happening .
mike , i &apos;m trying to help you .
and i appreciate that .
but i only have two references , harvey ,
you , who has to lie for me ,
and jonathan , who wants to kill me .
mike .
harvey , it &apos;s enough .
as much as you want to help me ,
you have no idea what it is
to have been a fraud and have to start all over .
i don &apos;t .
but someone else does .
if it isn &apos;t employee number 7611053 .
you still remember that .
i lied on my resume .
i never lied about having a head for numbers .
i never said how sorry i was for what happened to you .
you don &apos;t need to be sorry , mike .
the truth is , i should be thanking you .
what ?
you know what i do now ?
statistical analysis for fantasy baseball .
that &apos;s awesome .
you don &apos;t know the half of it .
my old , better job ,
i sat in my office , crunched my numbers ,
made a lot more money ,
barely knew the name of one person on my floor .
now my best friends are people i work with .
well , why &apos;d you call me ?
the last time i saw you ,
you had no idea what you were gonna do
with the rest of your life .
you had to completely start over ,
and it looks like you did .
i guess i--
want to know how .
start by starting .
what does that mean ?
it means , for six months ,
i threw myself a giant pity party ,
wondered how the hell
i was gonna get out of the mess i was in .
and then one day i said , &quot; enough &apos;s enough . &quot;
and instead of asking questions ,
i started looking for answers .
and you found fantasy baseball .
no , i found out that how much money you make
is not the most important thing in the world .
who you spend it with , every day , is .
thanks , stan . i appreciate it .
whoa , mike .
why exactly is it you need to start over ?
that &apos;s a long story .
i have time .
another day , stan .
you wanted to see me ?
yes .
clear your schedule tonight .
done . why ?
jessica offered me anything i want
as a reward for my heroism ,
and we &apos;re gonna figure out what that is .
what &apos;s to figure out ? named partner .
no , not that . anything but that .
what do you mean , &quot; anything but that ? &quot;
there isn &apos;t anything but that .
oh , you think i didn &apos;t ask for it ?
the words were out of my mouth
faster than esther when she was 13 .
louis , i don &apos;t care about your slutty sister .
you deserve named partner .
and i don &apos;t care that you don &apos;t care
because it &apos;s not gonna happen .
now , we were given a chance to take the high road ,
and that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re gonna do .
if i were ever going to be attracted to you ,
now would be the time .
instead i &apos;ll prepare a list of demands befitting a hero .
good .
and don &apos;t ever talk about being attracted to me again .
it weirds me out .
the answer &apos;s no .
you don &apos;t even know what i &apos;m here for .
i know what you &apos;re not here for .
to tell me after a long night of soul @-@ searching ,
you &apos;ve decided to give me full control of gillis industries .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m not .
but i am here to give you full control of this .
this isn &apos;t public information .
it will be in 24 hours .
so it &apos;s legal to give it to you .
and it gives me a 24 @-@ hour edge
if i decide to act on this information .
which , as you can see from that filing ,
would be a very profitable thing to do .
and all i have to do in return is use your law firm ?
i don &apos;t care what law firm you use .
i just want you to have mike ross
run point on the deal .
then we &apos;re back where we started ,
and you can get the hell out of my office .
jonathan , i know what he did ,
but he thought he had no choice .
when a person thinks he has no choice
is when you see his true character .
you think you have no choice
other than to be vindictive right now .
this isn &apos;t vindictive . it &apos;s common sense .
and where i come from ,
you don &apos;t give the fox another run at the henhouse .
you wouldn &apos;t have even had a shot at the henhouse
if it wasn &apos;t for him getting you out from under tony gianopolous .
and i repaid him for that by giving him his first shot
at investment banking .
and where i come from ,
the way you really repay someone
is by giving them a second goddamn shot .
then go the hell back to where you came from .
and , hey , if you think he &apos;s so great ,
take him back there with you .
louis , you have a minute ?
not really .
i &apos;m in the middle of some very important gift @-@ choosing .
what ?
yeah , wouldn &apos;t you like to know ?
but you never will
because a person only gets gifts
when they fix the mistakes that jeff malone &apos;s made .
actually , louis , that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
i wanted to thank you for catching that error
on the wexler stock .
you want to thank me ?
yes , louis , i do .
look , i know you don &apos;t trust me ,
but you got us out of a jam ,
and i &apos;m here to thank you , man @-@ to @-@ man .
bullshit .
you &apos;re here to kiss my ass
because you found out that
i &apos;m now above you in the pecking order .
louis , i don &apos;t care about the pecking order ,
and all i found out is that you fixed this thing for harvey ,
and i am here to thank you .
i &apos;m not talking about harvey , and you know it .
no , louis .
don &apos;t play dumb with me .
i &apos;m talking about jessica pearson ,
the woman whose ass you &apos;ve really been kissing ,
the very same woman who came to me
and asked me to check your work .
yeah , uh @-@ huh .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have some lipizzaner stallions to look at .
you had louis litt check my work ?
i was wondering when we might get into this .
well , the wondering is over because it &apos;s now .
and if you were going to do something like that ,
you should have discussed it with me first
before going behind my back .
i did discuss it with you ,
and you stood right there and said your work was perfect
and i should trust you .
you see , that &apos;s the problem right there .
you don &apos;t trust me .
and now you &apos;re just rubbing my mistake in my face .
if the goal was to rub it in your face ,
i would have done that already ,
and we wouldn &apos;t be having this conversation .
in that case , maybe we should
keep our conversations on a professional level for a while .
you &apos;re the one who wanted to do both .
and maybe i was wrong .
i never said i didn &apos;t trust you .
i said i didn &apos;t trust your work on wexler .
that &apos;s the difference between us , jessica .
you see , when i say , &quot; trust me , &quot;
i mean trust the man who works for you
and the man that &apos;s with you .
you wanted to see me ?
you don &apos;t seem in a good mood .
i &apos;m not .
we can talk about it later .
i walked all the way down here .
we can talk about it now .
i was just gonna ask how louis &apos; talk went .
bullshit .
that is not an &quot; i have to come talk to you &quot; conversation .
i want to bring mike back .
that is not a conversation i ever want to have .
jessica--
harvey , i haven &apos;t slept better
since his last night ,
except for every night since ,
and i &apos;m not going back .
in case you really were wondering ,
louis took his thank @-@ you like a dick .
and if that &apos;s all , i &apos;m going home .
are you cooking ?
i make one thing ,
and i make it awesome .
mike , every single guy thinks that his spaghetti sau--
oh , my god . that &apos;s amazing .
not every single guy was raised by his grandmother .
now you sit down , shut up ,
and tell me about your day .
what got you in such a good mood ?
oh , you know , nothing .
just spent the afternoon
figuring out what i &apos;m gonna do with my life .
well , that sounds like quite the afternoon .
what did you figure out ?
well , i figured out i don &apos;t want
to take the job with forstman ,
and i don &apos;t want to be an investment banker .
so what do you want to be ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i know i want to be with you .
what are you saying ?
i want to start over .
i don &apos;t understand .
rachel , when i met you ,
i had nothing in my life
except what came from being a fraud .
and now i have nothing in it except being with you ,
and i wouldn &apos;t go back
even if i could because ...
mike--
i don &apos;t care what i do for a living .
i mean , i &apos;ll figure it out ,
but as long as i have you ,
i have everything .
rachel ?
what-- i didn &apos;t mean to make you cry .
i meant to make you feel better .
hey , hey , everything &apos;s going to be okay .
no , it &apos;s not .
rachel , what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;m sorry . i just need a minute .
rachel .
i just need a minute .
hey . hey , hey , hey . i &apos;m right here . you can tell me .
what &apos;s going on ?
i can &apos;t .
rachel , stop . yes you can .
no , you don &apos;t--
i don &apos;t deserve you .
what are you talking about ?
rachel , hey--
logan and i kissed .
what ?
we were just talking ,
and then he--
he what ?
mike , please .
i am so sorry .
mike , no , please .
please , it didn &apos;t mean anything .
wait . please .
i &apos;m ...
this is how you handle losing ?
i &apos;m not here about gillis industries .
ooh , you gonna fight me ?
you stay the hell away from rachel .
well , that &apos;s up to her .
but if she does come back here ,
it won &apos;t be to tell me to stay away .
i don &apos;t know what she told you .
but she let it go on a long time .
and she didn &apos;t just like it .
she loved it .
you told him .
i don &apos;t even know where he is .
he &apos;s at harvey &apos;s .
how do you know ?
where did you go ?
forstman ?
logan .
gillis .
rachel .
get the hell in here .
i never should have told him .
rachel , there &apos;s no use thinking that .
what if he doesn &apos;t forgive me ?
you don &apos;t know that he won &apos;t .
you don &apos;t know that he will .
and you &apos;re the one that said ,
&quot; this will bore a hole in his head . &quot;
and you &apos;re the one who said you had to find a way
to trust him with the truth .
he walked out . i can &apos;t just--
stay here tonight ?
of course you can .
i &apos;m not going back there .
i &apos;m not saying you have to .
i &apos;m saying you need to calm down .
would you calm down after someone
stuck it in your face like that ?
i would if i knew he was just trying to get in my head .
how the hell do you know that &apos;s all it is ?
because that piece of shit did it to you before ,
and i let him because i &apos;m his lawyer ,
but i &apos;m not gonna let him do it to you now .
yeah , well , he got in my head .
he put the image in there , and now i can &apos;t get it out .
mike--
look , i need to know if it &apos;s true .
and what good is gonna come of that ?
i just need to know .
then there &apos;s only one way to find out .
but you &apos;re not gonna find out tonight .
here .
mike .
oh , my god , i was so worry-
oh , my god , your face . what happened ?
you know what happened .
you went to see logan .
i want you to tell me exactly what happened
between you and him .
okay , why don &apos;t we just go home right now .
and we can talk about all of it there ?
you &apos;re gonna tell me what happened right here .
mike , i--
i need to know that i can trust you ,
because you said that it didn &apos;t mean anything ,
but he said--
mike , please .
did it mean something or not ?
it meant something when it happened , but now--
okay , look . okay .
i made a huge mistake ,
but you just asked if you could trust me--
trust you ?
you didn &apos;t tell me about this for a week ,
and then when you finally did , you lied .
i didn &apos;t lie .
you walked out before i could tell you the whole story .
the whole story ?
there &apos;s no way you were going to tell me that whole story .
mike , please .
he said that you loved it !
and when i said that it didn &apos;t matter
what i &apos;d do next because i have you ?
i was wrong .
because we &apos;re done .
ooh , it &apos;s busy .
okay , listen , rachel . when you are done can you just--
holy shit , are you ?
no , i &apos;m not .
so help me , if harvey mistreated you , i will--
it wasn &apos;t harvey , louis . it &apos;s mike .
that son of a bitch . where is he ?
because i &apos;ll--
it wasn &apos;t him . it was me .
rachel .
look , i know that he hurt you with sheila ,
but i love him ,
and i lost him .
and i don &apos;t really know what to do .
oh , come on , hey . hey , hey , hey , hey , hey ,
listen to me right now , okay ?
whatever i may think of mike ,
i have no doubt that he loves you .
and when two people love each other ,
no problem is insurmountable .
that &apos;s bullshit .
and you of all people know it .
what ?
you and sheila loved each other ,
and you still broke up ,
even though neither of you had done anything wrong .
that &apos;s different .
did you hear me ?
i did something wrong .
and now he doesn &apos;t trust me ,
and i can &apos;t make him trust me or forgive me .
so it doesn &apos;t matter how much i love him , okay ?
because ...
okay , all right , listen .
rachel , you have so much going for you .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
and what good is any of it
if i don &apos;t have the one person i want to share it with ?
logan , what are you doing here ?
you told mike after you explicitly told me not to .
i don &apos;t have to explain myself to you .
really ?
i didn &apos;t mean for it--
it doesn &apos;t matter what you did or didn &apos;t mean to happen .
it happened ,
and i know why it did .
what are you talk--
you told him because
deep down inside , you want to be with me ,
and you knew this would make it happen .
that is bullshit .
really ?
because that is exactly what you said to me
when i told allison about us .
that has nothing to do with this .
rachel .
and since you obviously came here
to find out where it is we stand ,
let me tell you .
there is no us .
there will never be an us .
and no matter what happens between me and mike ,
this is the last time
that you and i are ever gonna have a conversation again .
you &apos;re my lawyer .
not anymore , logan .
so whatever real or fake meeting you have with harvey ,
you can go to it now ,
but i won &apos;t be in it
or any other meeting you have here in the future
because we &apos;re done .
louis , glad you &apos;re here .
i just got off the phone with charles forstman .
he wants to cross the &quot; t &quot; s , dot the &quot; i &quot; s ,
and be done with this deal , and so do i.
oh , believe me , jessica . nobody wants to be done
with that man more than me .
i &apos;m actually heading over there in an hour ,
but before i do , i just wanted to tell you
that i finally figured out what i want as my reward .
and what is that ?
i want to amend my contract
to allow for telecommuting whenever i deem appropriate
and a month &apos;s more vacation every year to be used at my discretion .
anything else ?
i want it in writing ,
and i want my partnership protected
for as long as this situation persists .
okay .
before i give you what you &apos;re asking--
jessica , you said i could have whatever i want .
you &apos;re not gonna talk me out of this .
i &apos;m not trying to talk you out of anything .
i just want to say that the fact
that name partner isn &apos;t happening now
doesn &apos;t mean it never will ,
and i &apos;d hate to see you throw in the towel because you &apos;ve lost faith .
yeah , well , the only thing i &apos;m throwing
is my hat in the ring for sheila &apos;s heart .
i don &apos;t understand .
i love her .
and i miss her .
and i want to try to win her back ,
and i need these things to make that happen .
then you have them .
rachel , are you okay ?
i don &apos;t know .
where are you going ?
i don &apos;t know .
i just can &apos;t be here , and i can &apos;t be at home .
i can &apos;t be anywhere .
go see him .
i don &apos;t even know where he is .
yes , you do .
i did see him .
he came here , and everything went to shit .
and i tried to explain , and he wouldn &apos;t listen .
and then he said we &apos;re just done .
rachel .
i &apos;m sorry , donna .
if it &apos;s about mike , i &apos;m busy .
harvey , i know about your issues with infidelity ,
but--
donna , stop right there .
no , i &apos;m not gonna stop
because you need to go talk to mike about rachel .
need .
yes , need .
listen to me because i &apos;m only gonna say this once .
what she did is between the two of them ,
and i &apos;m not gonna get in the middle of it
one way or another , but if i did ,
it sure as shit wouldn &apos;t be to defend her .
harvey , your lack of emotional awareness
never ceases to amaze me .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i &apos;m not asking you to do this for rachel .
i &apos;m asking you to do this for mike .
like i said , i &apos;m busy .
may i ?
since when do you need permission ?
to come in , i don &apos;t .
no , you don &apos;t .
and i &apos;ll come back when you &apos;re in a more receptive mood .
what exactly am i being receptive to ?
you are
not just any partner in this firm .
you are the man i am involved with ,
and i need to take that into consideration from now on .
you sound like you &apos;re saying that as damage control .
i &apos;m saying it because i mean it .
then why does it still sound
like you &apos;re talking to your employee ?
because it &apos;s hard for me
to say that i don &apos;t want to lose you
over some stupid work bullshit .
now , that &apos;s what i &apos;m talkin &apos; about .
so you just wanted to make it hard for me .
i just wanted to hear you say it .
it being hard for you is on you .
so we &apos;re good .
oh , yeah . we &apos;re good .
all right .
jessica , one more thing .
if you don &apos;t want to lose me over some stupid work bullshit ,
then please don &apos;t do stupid work bullshit .
you &apos;re fired .
&quot; simple term condition , &quot;
blah @-@ blah , blah @-@ blah .
yeah , it &apos;s all there .
you just need to sign by the arrows .
walk me through this one more time .
it says sanders international
agrees to pay you the aforementioned amount .
through a swiss account or the caymans ?
both , per your instructions .
now are we done ?
you went to a lot of trouble to shelter some money for me .
because you forced me to .
which got me to wondering .
what &apos;s to keep you from walking out of here ,
growing a conscience ,
and telling someone about our little arrangement ?
because if i do , i &apos;ll be admitting to my own guilt ,
which you damn well know .
right , but what exactly are you guilty of ?
what is this ?
that &apos;s your fee for putting this deal together .
i don &apos;t want a fee .
that &apos;s exactly why you &apos;re gonna take it .
son of a bitch .
you didn &apos;t bring me here for you to sign on the arrows .
you brought me here for me to sign on the arrows .
yep .
and i don &apos;t give a shit what you do with the money
after it goes into your account ,
but it &apos;s going in there .
i won &apos;t .
it &apos;s up to you .
now you can either close this deal
or go back to writing in your diary
about what a loser harvey specter thinks you are .
sign it , pal .
mike , what are you doing here ?
what are you doing here ?
you know what ? doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;m here to take a job .
wait . what ?
no , you can &apos;t do that .
what do you care ?
mike , listen to me .
i know i &apos;m mad at you about sheila ,
but i don &apos;t care about that right now .
you cannot take a job with that man .
i don &apos;t have any other options , louis .
and i &apos;m in this position
because you paid that man greenmail
to walk away from my deal in the first place .
believe me , i wish i hadn &apos;t .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
mike--
you know what ?
doesn &apos;t matter . none of it matters .
this is about rachel , isn &apos;t it ?
she told me she hurt you .
believe me , i understand ,
but you cannot do this because of that .
this is a job , louis , all right ?
i &apos;m not robbing a bank .
it &apos;s not a job !
it &apos;s a decision ,
and i &apos;m not gonna let you make it .
yeah ?
what are you gonna do about it ?
anything i have to .
you want to see me ?
i thought you wanted to see me .
i wanted to see you both .
louis .
is this about implementing your request with sheila ?
it &apos;s about retracting my request with sheila .
what happened ? i thought--
nothing happened .
i hired mike ross back at the firm .
what ?
if sheila and i are meant to be ,
we &apos;ll make that work ,
but mike was gonna do something
that i could not let him do .
so i &apos;m using my reward on him .
okay , lewis , i--
it &apos;s a great choice .
i &apos;m proud of you .
why don &apos;t you give me a minute with jessica
and see if we can &apos;t get him an office ?
thank you , harvey . thank you both .
is that it ?
i &apos;d still like to be able to take rosh hashanah off ,
if that &apos;s okay .
i think we can work something out .
no way .
jessica .
mike ross is not coming back to this firm .
you heard louis . he already gave him the job .
he can un @-@ give him the job .
it &apos;s too late for that , and you know it .
well , it damn sure didn &apos;t help when you jumped on in there
and told him it was a great choice .
it was a great choice ,
and if i hadn &apos;t jumped in and let you speak your mind ,
you know what he would have heard ?
something &apos;s wrong with mike ross .
you don &apos;t know that .
yes , i do , and so do you .
this is louis we &apos;re talking about .
and you rejected his first request .
because it was unreasonable .
and the only way you &apos;re gonna convince him
that this is unreasonable is to tell him why .
harvey--
jessica , the only way to make him take that offer back
is to force him to do it
because he &apos;s gonna ask you why again and again .
and no matter what you say ,
he &apos;s gonna know you &apos;re full of shit .
and then how long do you think it &apos;s gonna take him
to remember that last year ,
he wondered if mike even went to harvard .
you could at least pretend to hide how happy you are .
i may be happy about it ,
but you know i &apos;m right .
and the truth is ,
i never should have let him go in the first place .
you look a lot better than the last time i saw you .
well , didn &apos;t you hear ?
i got a new job .
oh , i heard .
what &apos;re you getting at there , harvey ?
what am i getting at ?
louis hires you .
you don &apos;t run it by me .
you don &apos;t even tell me it &apos;s happening .
all i am anymore to you is a clean set of sheets .
speaking of which , you might want to up the thread count .
and run it by you ?
you were practically begging me to come back yesterday .
i didn &apos;t beg shit .
i posited a theory .
we both knew it was never gonna happen .
i was just trying to make you feel better .
i guess it took louis to do what you couldn &apos;t do .
hire an unqualified fraud ?
i did that already .
seriously , mike ,
it &apos;s good to have things back to normal .
yeah . normal .
mike , i &apos;m gonna say something to you
that i have never told you before .
i admire what you have with rachel .
harvey--
no , let me finish .
it &apos;s real .
it &apos;s hard to come by ,
and all you have to do to keep it is forgive her .
so if you want to stay here tonight , by all means ,
but i think you should go home .
where are you going ?
i have to take care of something
i should have days ago .
harvey . you wanted to see me ?
yes .
i wanted you to take a look at a draft of the paperwork
to wrap up your deal .
why would you--
because i wanted to let you know
how things are gonna be moving forward .
you &apos;re gonna sign these papers at 8 : 00 a.m tomorrow ,
and at 8 : 01,
you &apos;re gone .
harvey .
look , i don &apos;t give a shit
how much business you give my firm .
i never want to see you again .
you &apos;re really gonna drop me ?
you &apos;re damn right i am .
and if you go to jessica to try to overrule me ,
the next time , it won &apos;t be mike you get in a fight with .
it &apos;ll be me .
you &apos;re home .
i am .
why aren &apos;t you at work ?
because i spent the whole day moving
from one place to another ,
and i just had to talk to you .
how &apos;d you know i &apos;d be here ?
i didn &apos;t . i just went to harvey &apos;s .
yeah .
not there anymore .
are you back here ?
no .
no , i &apos;m going to stay somewhere for a while .
mike--
rachel , whatever you &apos;re going to say ,
now is not the time to say it .
if you want there to be a chance for us ...
at all ,
just go back out a little longer
and let me get my things together .
one more thing .
i &apos;m coming back to work tomorrow .
if you can &apos;t accept that ,
then whatever you were going to say to me
won &apos;t matter .
