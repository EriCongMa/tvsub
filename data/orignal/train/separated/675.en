My mother's still alive.
Victoria is the only person left who
could possibly tell me where she is.
Mason Treadwell.
I know who you are.
You wrote that book about David Clarke.
Thank you for...
taking an interest.
My father told me...
My mother died in an institution.
Why would he make me believe she was dead
when she was obviously still alive?
Because he was trying to protect you.
Amanda. Damn it.
Your mother tried to kill you.
That's a lie.
It is the absolute truth!
Jack, it's Amanda.
There's been an accident.
Mommy's here.
Come here.
It's okay.
They say let he who is without sin
cast the first stone.
Amanda!
Hang in there, Amanda. Daddy's here.
Amanda!
And to be without sin requires absolute forgiveness.
Come on, baby. Hang in there.
Amanda!
No!
Don't touch her!
Okay, come on. Breathe.
Breathe, Amanda.
But when your memories are freshly opened wounds,
forgiveness is the most unnatural of human emotions.
You okay?
I know why my father lied to me.
Like always, he was protecting me.
Your father and I, we...
share the same protective instinct.
The reason I didn't tell you I'd found Kara
is because I wanted to make sure she couldn't hurt you.
There's something else you need to know about your mother.
Gordon Murphy wasn't just her savior.
He was her husband.
No.
She told me herself.
And after she tased me and left me to die,
I believe her.
I've been so driven to find her,
I never stopped to consider who she is.
Then you let me help you remember
what you came here to do--
Avenge your father's death.
You're Takeda's proxy.
Use that to get inside Grayson Global
and destabilize the company.
That's the best way to ferret them out.
Hey, you sure you're all right?
I needed someone.
You walked through the door.
Don't let it go to your head.
Mrs. Grayson, there's someone here to see you.
Tell them I'm not accepting any visitors.
Victoria.
Kara Clarke.
I'm so glad you're safe.
Such a beautiful home.
So smart to build it right on the ocean.
You can always see your enemies coming.
Well, my enemies have become increasingly difficult to identify.
Oh, I know.
I was so shocked to learn that the man that kidnapped you
was the FBI agent you'd been working with.
He seemed like a good man.
All men are born hardwired to betray.
It's just a question of when.
Do they have any leads on his whereabouts?
No, they don't.
But I'm so relieved that you didn't fall victim to him as well.
Oh, no.
He gave me a new life,
taught me how to live off the grid.
I hadn't seen him for 20 years.
Then he shows up a few months ago.
Why'd he go to you?
I don't know.
Did you file a statement with the authorities?
No. I'm...
I'm sure you can appreciate why.
Yes.
Where do you think he is?
If he's wise, far, far away from here.
And as you pointed out,
he's very gifted at the art of vanishing.
But I imagine your main concern is about Amanda.
Of course.
You've been so incredibly kind to her...
bringing her into your home...
and in such a public way.
I never would've been able to find her otherwise.
Well, it was the least I could do for her, poor thing.
Tragedy and sorrow seem to follow her everywhere she goes.
I'm such a dope.
May I wash up?
well, I take no pleasure in saying this,
but we fear Grayson Global may be an unrightable ship.
Your funds are being handled with the utmost discretion.
Discretion, or secrecy, rather, is the problem.
When Daniel first brought Mr. Takeda into the fold,
he offered a hands-on approach.
And since the feud between you and your son
was on full display at the board meeting last week,
that which I do see does not inspire confidence.
Oh, the Graysons hail from a rather spirited bloodline.
Whatever disagreement you may have witnessed,
I assure you, there is no rift.
With all due respect,
my employer requires greater assurances.
Daniel Grayson.
Son, I am sitting with Aiden Mathis,
Mr. Takeda's proxy.
I'd like you to make good on your promise of transparency
and acquaint Aiden with all aspects of our organization.
I am sending him to you now.
Excuse me.
What is it, sweetheart? I'm busy.
Too busy to deal with the fact
that Kara Clarke is still alive?
Uh, thank you, Mr. Mathis.
Would you mind closing the door?
Of course.
Thank you.
Is this a joke?
No, Conrad.
At this very moment,
she's in our powder room washing blood off her hands,
literally.
I thought Gordon Murphy took care of her decades ago.
You've got to get rid of her.
Oh, on the contrary.
I've asked her to stay for lunch.
Are you out of your mind?
Last I heard, Kara Clarke was a violent psychopath.
Don't you find it interesting that
she suddenly reemerges one day after her daughter takes that fall?
She could be the source of the journals,
the log-in sheet, everything.
I want to see you here in one hour.
Hey, Declan.
Hey.
I thought you should have this back.
It was very gentlemanly of you.
Oh, yeah.
We Porters are descended from a long line of gentlemen.
I'm headed to the hospital to check in on Amanda
and the latest little Porter.
You want to come with?
Uh, you know, you might want to wait.
Jack said they may try to bring her out of it today.
Does that mean she's okay?
I hope so, for everyone's sake.
But I gotta get this stuff done
so little Carl has a home to come back to.
Okay. I guess I'll see you around.
I'm beginning to understand why you robbed me.
Girl like that's not gonna go for a groupon.
You got it all wrong, man. I barely even know her.
Satisfy my curiosity.
Why'd you do it?
I don't have the money to go to college, okay?
Right.
That'd make for one hell of an admissions essay--
"How I rolled houses for a brighter future."
You think I'm an idiot. I get it.
On the contrary.
You remind me of myself at your age.
Call this guy.
He's got a certified crew
that'll do the work here for half the price twice as fast.
And why--why would you help me?
'cause I want my money back sooner than later.
And whatever you got in that little spray bottle
is not getting the job done.
Call or don't call.
But if you want that pretty little rich girl to see you
as more than a guy she rebelled with for one summer,
and I can tell you do,
you'll need that degree.
I gotta lay you down, buddy.
Papa Porter.
Congrats, pal.
Hey, how you holding up, huh?
Uh, I'm a little tired.
I bet.
How's mama Mandy?
She's gettin' better by the minute.
Uh, wow, Jack.
That is one hell of a swaddle.
Oh, well, get this.
His grandmother taught me.
What, your mom's back?
Not mine.
Hers.
Y-you're...
You're not serious.
I know, right?
As if things aren't messy enough.
Oh, uh, they--they do hourly checks.
Eh, say no more. I, uh, have to go see someone anyway.
Hang in there, pal.
Encouraging numbers.
You should also read the analysis.
Why? Would it tell me a different story?
It will if my dad took a pass...
Daniel,
An alert's come through the system.
Ashley Davenport, Aiden Mathis.
Charmed. We didn't officially get to meet the other day.
Hello.
Hi.
Aiden is Mr. Takeda's proxy.
My father asked me to acquaint him
with all things Grayson Global.
So whatever you have to say, feel free to say it.
Personnel's flagged an outside request
for David Clarke's employment contract.
That's right.
A bona fide terrorist used to work here.
That's something we try hard to forget.
Who's looking for it?
I don't know. Maybe a meeting might be prudent.
Set it up. Let's see who's suddenly curious.
Now back to the quarterlies.
Suddenly, I'm more interested
in this company's more historic associations.
Why don't we introduce Mr. Mathis
to the power of the corporate card?
Drinks tonight at Rinellas?
来自卡拉
Hello?
Someone's interested in your father's contract at Grayson Global.
Any reason to think it's your mother?
I don't even know where she is.
I've checked every hotel and hostel in the area.
Did you check the Graysons'?
Conrad took a phone call from Victoria,
paled at the sound of her voice.
Emily!
Keep me posted.
Way to keep me out of the loop, Ems.
Your mother's summering in the Hamptons?
Who told you that?
Jack,
who's currently registering a 6 on the freak-o-meter.
Me? I'm at 9,
which must put you at infinity times infinity.
I don't have time for this.
Well, assuming you don't have time to check your messages either.
Otherwise you'd know that, uh...
My dad died.
Oh, my god, Nolan.
Look, I know he wasn't murdered in prison
or accused of a crime he didn't commit,
still...
turns out he loved me.
I should've been there for you.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
But enough about that.
Tell me about Kara Clarke.
All I can tell you is that she thinks Amanda is her daughter.
That's good for... revenge-y stuff,
But sad for you.
I'm sorry, Ems.
Let's see.
So what are your plans, Ms. Clarke?
I should hope that you'd stay with us.
She's staying at the Graysons'?
You think it's safe here?
What about your kidnapper?
That man is nothing more than a slippery coward
who wouldn't have the guts to darken our doorstep.
Even if he did, he'd be shot on sight.
In other words,
so long as you remain under our roof, you'll be safe.
No place like home. Huh, Auntie Ems?
Hey, Jack.
Emily...
Oh, my god.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Amanda's out of her coma.
Well, that's good. Right?
It is until my mother hears the news.
She's not out of the woods yet.
Hey, welcome back.
We got someone here who wants to meet you.
Oh, my god.
That's him?
Is he okay?
This is your mommy.
He's so little.
Don't worry. He's tougher than he looks, like his mom.
I didn't know the two of you would be here when I woke up.
Well, we're here.
Neither one of us is going anywhere. All right?
Thanks for coming back to us. I couldn't do this alone.
Welcome back, Amanda.
We're gonna go home soon, okay?
Where's mommy?
What do you remember last?
We were swimming.
Do you know how sometimes when people get sick,
no matter how hard they try
and no matter how many doctors help,
they just aren't able to get better?
But mommy said she was better.
She wanted to be.
She wanted that more than anything.
But I--
She just-- she wasn't strong enough.
Where is she?
She's... gone.
I'm so sorry, honey.
I'll let you two get acquainted.
You must be so relieved.
Look, I know the Stowaway's not open yet,
and Amanda still has a bunch of stuff at my house,
so they're welcome to stay with me temporarily.
Are you sure?
Carl has a lot of stuff
for someone who only weighs 7 pounds.
I'll always have a room for him.
Have you called Amanda's mom yet?
I wanted to wait until I told her that she was back.
That's a good idea.
And you should go home, take a break...
change your clothes.
I stink?
Eh, a shower wouldn't kill you.
Thanks, Emily.
Hey, I'm, uh, I'm running home for a bit,
but Emily's here if you need anything, okay?
Congratulations.
He's somethin'.
Yeah. He is.
We're survivors.
Amanda, I had no right to put you in that situation.
I'm so sorry.
So the hunt for your mother is over?
She's back, Amanda.
She showed up last night.
Good.
So at least it wasn't all for nothing.
Ms. Clarke?
You ready to come with me for those last few tests?
I can look after Carl if you wanna go.
Is that where David lived?
He told me that he had fallen in love with the woman next door.
I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable.
Well, thinking about David always makes me uncomfortable.
I imagine that's something we both share.
Why did you save me all those years ago?
A lot of women would've felt threatened by me.
Although...
technically, you're the other woman, not me.
You know, he led me to believe that you were dead for the longest time.
Obviously, we both fell prey to David's deception.
And now Gordon's.
Mom?
I just got off the phone with the hospital.
Amanda's awake and okay.
Charlotte, this is Amanda's mother,
Kara Clarke.
I'm going to the hospital.
I'll come back and bring my things.
Thank you.
You asked her to stay with us?
Temporarily, yes.
I feel so bad about what happened to her daughter
that I just wanted to help out.
Maybe you have changed.
Dec!
What the hell, man? It smells terrible in here.
I know. I'm doing the best I can with what we have... Pops.
How's Amanda?
She's good.
She's good. We're, uh... we're good.
Good. That's good.
Yeah, well, something's gotta be
when I'm standing in the place
that's supposed to be making us our living
and paying these hospital bills.
I know. Um, Kenny stopped by today with a plan "B."
He says that that guy can get done what we need
fast and cheap.
I like the sound of that.
Yeah, me, too,
Only my judgment's been a little bit off lately and...
yeah, well, I wanted to wait for your okay.
Well, he's a businessman who wants his money.
Why have us waste any more of it, right?
I'll give this guy a call right now.
Thank you for coming in.
I'm Daniel Gray--
Daniel Grayson.
I know. Padma Lahari,
Nolcorp C.F.O.
I hope everything's okay?
Why wouldn't it be?
In my experience,
when a simple request gets an outsized response,
either something's wrong or I've won something.
Have I won something?
Let's see what we're playing for, shall we?
Please, sit.
I understand you're looking for information about David Clarke.
Yes. I need to corroborate his initial terms of employment
at Grayson Global.
I hope you can understand the sensitivity
we still feel over the unfortunate association
this company has with such a man.
Yes. I imagine it can be quite tricky.
Tell me,
what do the terms of Mr. Clarke's employment
at a Wall Street investment firm
have to do with a tech company like Nolcorp?
I wanted to make sure
that when Nolcorp invested in Grayson Global years ago
that David Clarke wasn't on the account.
It wouldn't do to have a terrorist handling our finances,
would it?
I'll look into it and get back to you.
And much obliged.
So that explains that.
I'm not sure it does.
Tyler tried to land Nolcorp last summer for the first time,
which means they've never invested with us before.
Are we still on for drinks?
Where are you taking my grandson?
I was just trying to settle him.
I'm his godmother.
I'm Kara,
Amanda's actual mother.
May I?
Don't worry.
He knows his family.
Amanda was the same way,
always happy in her mommy's arms.
The perfect little baby boy.
What was Amanda like as a kid?
She...
she was so gentle.
She wouldn't even let me kill a spider.
No matter how big or small,
I had to catch it in a glass and set it free outside.
She just always had this innate goodness.
Does she ever talk about me?
Honestly, no.
When was the last time you saw her?
Well, now that is a fascinating question.
Oh, please allow me to introduce myself.
Mason Treadwell.
And is it possible that you're Kara Clarke?
Yes. Yes, I am.
God, I love the Hamptons.
You see, I was inexorably drawn back here
in pursuit of the truth behind your daughter's recent welcome
into the Grayson fold,
which makes your appearance...
How shall I say it? A revelation.
Are you for real?
Oh, I am, my dear, and so wonderfully are you.
The years have been kind, Kara.
Where have you been?
Away.
Oh, that's one of my favorite places.
If you don't mind my asking,
why let your daughter think
that you were deceased these last two decades?
I do.
I do mind you asking.
When you get a C.A.T. scan, you throw me a party.
Well, admittedly, I'm a crasher,
but one who only brings well-wishes.
What the hell are you doing here?
Paying my respects, of course.
Please, allow me.
Please.
I think you've done quite enough, Mason.
I'll come back.
Amanda, sweetie...
Do you remember me?
I think Carl's hungry.
I'll bring him to you.
Oh, sweetheart.
Kara, I think we should let these two rest.
When Amanda's released,
she'll be staying with me for a few days.
Perhaps you'd like to come visit in the morning?
Yes.
Maybe I could drive you home.
She didn't recognize me. I really thought she would.
Can't imagine how that must feel.
Have you read Treadwell's book?
Mm. I still can't accept
that David was capable of such terrible things.
He was my high school sweetheart.
Can you believe that?
You never know when or how you'll meet your true love.
He was only my first love.
There's a difference.
Well, at least David didn't destroy Amanda.
No.
He didn't.
I know I've been A.W.O.L., but...
I just became an uncle.
Well, one of those non-uncle uncles,
like Kracker or Fester.
Pretty sure Fester actually was Gomez's older brother.
All right, you pass.
Where did you get this?
It was amongst your father's memorabilia.
You did nothing with it?
No. Why?
Should I?
Nope.
I'll take care of it, but...
not before I take you to breakfast.
But it's 10:00 at night, Nolan.
Then we've got some time to kill.
To a growing relationship, both business and personal.
Well, tell that to my dad.
The company's falling apart, and he leaves before lunch.
Which is something I'm sure you wouldn't want me
to convey to Mr. Takeda.
You see, this is why we English are stereotyped as reserved.
Candor runs the risk of brooking discontent.
Oh, well, the American way is truth, honesty...
and a tiny bladder.
Now if you'll excuse me, I...
need to use the loo.
Very good.
You make a nice couple.
What about you? Anyone special?
Well, the nomadic lifestyle
doesn't allow for much permanence, I'm afraid.
Although Mr. Takeda did mention somebody that I should look up.
Uh, a miss, um...
Emily... Thorpe?
Thorne.
She and Daniel used to be engaged.
Well, leave it to me to step in it.
Oh, no, you didn't. She did.
She cheated on him.
Well, to, uh, your good fortune and, um, maybe mine.
We nomads have little need for fidelity,
so I may ring her up.
You can't be here.
But you told me to keep you posted.
No, I mean, you can't be here.
My mother is next door.
She sees you, our cover's blown--
Not just with her but with the Graysons,
which would never have happened if you hadn't gone to
see her in the first place.
What do you want?
To inform you that the inquiry about your father's contract
came from a woman named Padma Lahari,
claiming to be Nolcorp's C.F.O.
She pulls that thread,
it could expose the source of your wealth.
I liquidated my Nolcorp stock years ago.
But this could be bad for Nolan.
Well, he's not my concern.
Well, he's mine.
What's she doing?
That's his phone, isn't it?
You had it all along.
Answer that phone and it will be the last thing you ever do.
You wanna do this alone?
Fine.
But you'll soon find out I make a far
better partner than enemy.
How long until high tide?
20 minutes?
I like living on the edge of...
the land,
the water,
of the honeydew.
Morning, sunshine.
We need to talk.
I've been trying to get ahold of you all night.
Sounds serious.
Need my help?
No. You need mine.
I'm already shocked.
Someone from your company asked Daniel
about my father's investment.
Nolan, it was Padma.
You okay?
Then drink up before we're underwater.
Just one night, I promise.
Not a problem.
All right.
I'm gonna--I'm gonna take off and go to the Stowaway, okay?
Okay.
Thanks again.
Is everything okay?
Depends who you ask.
Jack seems happy
with his little Carl.
But every time I see him holding the baby, I just...
I wanna tell him the truth, that Carl isn't his.
But, of course, I have to deal with your mom first.
All you have to do is tell her the truth,
that you don't know who she is and she has to leave.
You spent all this time,
risked my life looking for her,
and now you just want her to leave?
While you were recovering,
a memory came back to me.
When I was 5, my mother tried to kill me.
She succeeded, actually.
She drowned me.
My father had to bring me back to life.
I... How could a mother do that?
Maybe someday I'll know, but for now...
The best thing for us, and especially for Carl,
is that she leaves.
Call her.
See, that's the thing about martinis.
Two's not enough, four is too many.
I could use another drink after the morning we're having.
You should tell Takeda to take his money and run.
But that would debilitate Grayson Global.
Well, maybe we deserve it.
I know how you feel about your father.
It's obvious that's why you want us to divest.
I feel the same way about the chains that bind me.
So?
I may have something.
It's about the Nolcorp request.
Okay, how do you know about that?
Because I'm ambitious, same as you.
When David Clarke worked here,
he ran venture capital, right?
What if Nolan Ross came to him for start-up money?
But he didn't, or there'd be a record of it.
Not if the money he invested came from a personal account.
See, I think the young lady from Nolcorp
was trying to sniff out whether or not Clarke's contract
contained an exclusivity clause.
Which it would have. They all do.
Which means he was working on behalf of the company,
regardless of where the capital came from.
Which also means...
This company has a controlling interest in Nolcorp.
We play this right, we guarantee two things--
Me a seat here on the board, and you...
the seat behind your father's desk.
Put me through to personnel.
Archives.
There may be no sadder sight
than a woman attempting to rob her own house.
Unless, of course, you misplaced something,
like the dead woman who I hear has been sleeping in this bed.
Though being dead is de rigueur around here these days.
You should try it sometime, Mason.
And how did you get in here?
Every maid has her price,
especially when grotesquely underpaid.
I read your "Vanity fair" article.
It was like gazing at your lovely visage, Victoria--
The most elegant blend of fact and fiction.
What do you want?
What do any of us want?
The truth.
I came to unearth it about your ludicrous kidnapping story,
But now I've stumbled across something that's far juicier.
Now if memory serves,
you told me that Kara Clarke was dead.
I honestly believed that.
Do you... gag a little when you say that? "Honestly"?
I think you've failed to understand
the threat Kara poses to all of us.
She may know the truth about David,
in which case, she will take you down along with us.
I think I'll be fine.
Sorry.
I'll leave you two alone.
I'll be right here.
I...
I understand if you want nothing to do with me.
So I'll just...
I'll just say my piece then go.
Despite...
All the odds against you,
you survived.
And you've grown into an amazing,
amazing young woman.
You're strong.
You're independent.
You're...
You're everything
that I... could ever have hoped for you to be.
You need to know that, um,
I was very sick...
For a long time.
and I w--
I was not fully in control of my actions.
And...
Your father and I
made a choice...
One that I knew I would h-have to live with.
You need to tell her I died.
It'll be better for her if she thinks I'm gone.
Somehow, your father found it in his heart
to forgive me.
Wait.
I forgive you, too.
So this is it. We're in the clear.
We can finally start paying you back.
Well... There may be a bigger opportunity here.
Frankly, I've always wanted to be in the bar business.
You wanna buy it?
I will forgive your kid brother's debt if you let me.
I asked around, Jack,
heard what this place did to you.
Your mom left. Your dad died.
So you wanna pull 14-hour shifts
or you wanna spend quality time with your beautiful family?
Okay. Let's talk.
I knew you were smart.
Well... What'd the inspector say?
There's the boy wonder.
Dec, we're back in business
and we couldn't have done it without you.
Are you seriously reading a book?
Yeah, it calms me. You should try it.
Well, I found this hidden in Kara's room.
There's one number on it.
That's Gordon Murphy's number.
She's made calls out. None came in.
Kara's been feeding him information.
Too many people know our secrets, Conrad.
And if they surface,
the Initiative is going to come after us--
And worse, our children.
I don't know who to turn to.
You can turn to me, of course.
Oh, please.
Victoria Grayson,
will you do me the honor of becoming my wife?
Again.
What is the matter with you?
J-just let me finish.
To have and to hold, and to be legally bound
so that we may never be compelled
to testify against each other in a court of law.
I'm sorry about what I said to your mom.
Forgiving her, it just... came out.
Don't be.
You did the right thing.
I need to tell you something about Carl.
I lied to you.
Jack really is the father.
Oh, my god.
Why would you do that to me?
I guess I felt like I needed to keep you on my side.
After everything we've been through?
Maybe because of it.
I know I haven't given you any reason to believe this.
I'm so sorry.
Me, too.
I knew you had feelings for Jack
when I tricked him into believing I was you.
And now I have this incredible family.
It's not fair. You deserve better, and...
Jack deserves the truth.
Jack deserves happiness.
If you tell him the truth now,
it'll only break his heart all over again.
Over time, we commit acts with intentions,
either good or bad, that require forgiveness.
I think my family could've been happy here.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.
It's okay.
Who knows? Maybe David wouldn't have made the mistakes he made.
Maybe none of us would have.
Trust me. Just as many mistakes are made here.
Do you think she really forgives me?
I think she wants to.
Just the woman I was looking for.
A quick raid of my research confirmed that
you had a terrible scar
from a burn you had suffered in a foster care fire--
One that I couldn't help but notice is now missing.
I had it removed.
Did you?
From what part of your body?
Why do you care, Mason?
I think you and I both know
the answer to that question, my dear.
You may be many things to many people--
The latest, it would seem, a young mother to an infant boy.
But the daughter of Kara Wallace and David Clarke?
That is one thing that you most definitely are not.
