法庭译员办公室
Alicia.
This shouldn't take more than 15 minutes, right, Alicia?
You accept the guilty plea,
you don't see more than a day of jail time,
and it's expunged from your record in 24 months.
Yes.
Two years and a day of community service,
and... you know.
Next...
What's wrong with you?
This guy means a lot of money.
He wants to hear it from you, not me.
I know, I'm just taking a minute to catch up, that's all.
Hey, Bernie.
What are you doing upstairs?
Seeing how the other half lives.
Hi, Alicia.
Bernie.
We really miss you downstairs.
There's my guys.
What's this?
Uh, the overflow from downstairs, Your Honor.
Male 128, 29, 30.
Okay, got it.
You understand you are pleading guilty, sir?
Yes, Your Honor, I understand.
Six months probation.
Next.
What do you have?
Your Honor, we have Frank Lister.
He is charged with disorderly conduct.
This is his second offense.
$1,500.
Next defendant.
Do we know that guy?
Which guy?
The convict in the middle.
He just whispered, "Help me."
Fine. Okay, let's handle the overflow.
Male 128, let's go.
Disorderly conduct. Do we have a plea here?
Uh, we've already pled not guilty, Your Honor.
We're ready to go to trial.
Good. Mr. ASA?
Almost, Your Honor.
We're still trying to locate a witness.
We ask for a continuance.
How long do you need?
Two months should do it.
Good. Continuance granted.
We'll go to trial April 15.
Sheriff, please escort the defendant back to lockup.
You were in bond court eight months ago.
Yes.
You were my second client.
You... you've been in prison all this time?
Yes.
But it was just a disorderly charge.
I know.
With $150,000 bail.
I couldn't afford it.
But that was to punish me, not you.
Didn't your case get called?
Three times.
The prosecutor keeps needing to find a witness.
Didn't Bernie ask for a speedy trial any of those three times?
No, he's new, he wasn't my lawyer.
You've had three different lawyers?
Four with you.
What the hell is going on here?
What's your name?
Clayton Riggs.
I'm Alicia Florrick.
Yeah, and I'm Bernie. Let's go, Alicia.
Visiting hours are over.
You want my help?
Alicia, stop talking to my client.
Sir, if you want my help, you can switch lawyers.
Alicia, I need you to get the hell out.
He's been in jail for eight months.
He lost his job, his wife.
His son is with child services.
And you want to do what for him?
Get him out.
Schakowsky is never gonna change the trial date, you know that.
He will if we sue him.
Judges have immunity.
Not if they knowingly violate a defendant's civil rights.
Is this about getting back at Schakowsky?
No.
No.
Then is this to assuage your guilty conscience?
This is about getting a man who has been unlawfully imprisoned
for eight months out of jail so he can be with his kid.
And you're doing this pro bono.
It's civil.
We'll take 20% of the $1.3 million.
No.
Because there'll never be $1.3 million.
You're back.
I thought you were gone for another few months.
Yeah, I didn't like it.
Can I come in?
Yeah, sorry.
See my hat?
"Take a byte out of Silicon Valley."
I do.
And... I got you oven mitts.
Thank you.
Uh, well, you... you have any work?
Can you work?
I can.
How much?
$20 raise.
Um, can I talk to my partner about it?
Sure, yeah.
Give me a call.
Okay, I will.
Jason.
I'm glad you're back.
Okay.
Hey, it's Jason Crouse.
I'm back in Chicago.
You need anything?
Yes, as a matter of fact, right now.
What's going on there, a gang war?
Worse, Illinois Park College
is trying to close down its student newspaper.
Ah, so a big case.
The daughter of a client, $33 million a year in billings.
On my way.
Thank you, Ms. Lockhart.
Imogen.
I keep thinking of you as a perpetual 14-year-old.
Yeah, my mom does, too.
How are you holding up in here?
This is not what I expected.
Yeah, it's weird to be the most hated person on campus.
Just like your mother.
It's hate speech,
and this campus is supposed to be a safe space.
It's an editorial, it's not arguing anything hateful.
You called the administrators "Mindless lemmings...
about to fall off the cliff of fascism."
Yes, because you're thinking of divesting from Israel
管理层的剥离以色列计划中充满了反犹太主义色彩
and requiring stamps on all products made by Israelis in the West Bank.
I wrote an editorial about it, that's all.
I understand why you don't like it,
but closing down the paper...
The fact that the school is willing
to stand up for oppressed populations--
it's why a lot of us chose to come here.
Um, Dean Randolph,
if I may.
Oh, yes, you're the lawyer,
here to speak for Ms. Stowe, yes.
That's right.
We understand that Illinois Park College
is a private institution and not governed by the First Amendment,
but, uh, you are governed by your student handbook,
a binding legal contract.
And the handbook lists "Freedom from persecution"
as the school's primary commitment.
And I think it's hard to argue that
a threat to defund the school newspaper is anything but persecution.
Oh, no, the move to defund the paper
is not a sword, but a shield--
to protect the safe space Gary's talking about.
Oh, well, the handbook also says
the school promotes "Tolerance of diverse viewpoints."
Ms. Stowe clearly has a diverse viewpoint and chose to...
I helped write that handbook, ma'am, and I can tell you
we did not have your interpretation in mind.
We meant to protect the viewpoints of diverse people.
The people, themselves.
Not the viewpoints.
I, um...
Before I, um...
take issue with that idea,
it is a well-established legal principle
that a party to a contract does not also get to interpret that contr...
I'm sure, but this is not a court of law, it's a school.
But you should realize that any university--
public or private-- must stand for basic notions of fairness.
And that is what we are here to do:
enforce progressive notions of fairness.
So why don't we at least take a preliminary vote,
see where we're at.
All those in favor
of defunding the Courier for the current school year.
So is that it?
No, actually.
This handbook guarantees your right
to take your grievances to arbitration.
Do you want to?
Alicia.
Good.
Hello.
Thanks for dropping by.
I need to say it again.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
I'm sorry for erasing the message.
Like I said, a day hasn't passed when I haven't...
What did it say?
What?
The voice mail-- What did it say?
What I told you before.
I want to know...
everything he said, word for word.
Alicia, it's been six years, I'm not sure...
And a day hasn't passed that you haven't thought about it,
so... what did it say?
"You want to know what my plan is?
My plan is that I love you."
And then he said something about Georgetown.
What about Georgetown?
How he'd always loved you, ever since Georgetown.
What else?
Don't stop.
Alicia, I don't think this is a good idea.
I want to know it all.
I want to know every single word he said.
You're torturing yourself.
Which is my right.
He said he would meet you anywhere,
and you can make a plan then.
Did he mention a place?
No.
A time?
No.
Is that important?
What else?
Just that if this didn't make sense to you,
to ignore him, ignore the message...
and things will go on as usual.
So when I didn't respond, he thought I got the message...
and things...
we just... we went back to usual?
Yes, I guess.
Are you out of your tiny little mind, Mrs. Florrick?
You don't need to say "little" when you say "tiny."
One or the other will do.
You're suing me?
You're suing a sitting judge?
Do you understand the meaning of professional suicide?
I know the meaning of a judge
who let an innocent man sit in prison
for eight months with a bail amount...
Did you miss the day in law school where they taught
the concept of judicial immunity?
That protects you from being sued
for what you did professionally, not personally.
This crusade is gonna cost you.
It's gonna cost you so much.
Shall we get that down on tape, Your Honor?
Your ex parte threats?
I didn't think so.
See you in court!
You can't second-guess agents of the judiciary, Your Honor.
As you yourself know,
judges need wide-ranging discretion
in order to do their jobs
and not worry about taking an unpopular stance
or making an honest mistake.
Discretion, yes, but it can't be unlimited.
Judicial immunity has to be unlimited.
Yes, but we are filing a civil rights claim
under 42 U.S.C. 1983.
Going after the judge personally is merely an end-around...
No.
We are holding Don Schakowsky accountable
as an individual for violating
Mr. Riggs' Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial
and Eighth Amendment freedom
from cruel and unusual punishment.
He exceeded his authority,
so he has to answer to this personally.
Your Honor, this is a direct attack
on the foundation of an independent judiciary.
Imagine that your decision here,
in this case, could be subject to a suit.
It would be chaos.
Exactly.
Mrs. Florrick may like or dislike
the way His Honor Schakowsky does his job.
But she does not have the right to veto it.
We're not asking for a veto, Your Honor.
This man has been held in prison for eight months,
his bail set at $150,000.
$150,000?
What did he do?
The charge is disorderly conduct.
$150,000 for disorderly conduct?
Yes, Your Honor.
Three men knocked him down
coming out of a concert and stole his wallet.
When the police arrived, they arrested him, too.
He was the victim, not the perpetrator.
That isn't proven yet.
Yes, because Schakowsky...
His Honor Schakowsky.
His Honor Schakowsky
has delayed trial three times.
Three times, Your Honor.
And eight months later,
our client is still in prison.
He lost his job, his wife divorced him,
and his eight-year-old child has been taken from his home.
That is unjust.
We ask that you rule on my client's immunity, Your Honor.
There is no suit here if my client is found immune.
I would agree.
Thank you, Your Honor.
No, I would agree that, from all appearances,
Mr. Riggs has had his civil rights violated,
but the question is whether His Honor Schakowsky did so knowingly.
If he did, his immunity is stripped.
The issue here concerns
the contractual language in the handbook?
Actually, the issue is free speech...
Yeah, and the idea of original intent.
Thank you. Uh, we'll all get a lot further
if we take this one at a time.
Ms. Reed?
Yes, Mr. Arbitrator, thank you.
Geoffrey, please.
Now, you claim the handbook permits the school to defund its newspaper?
Yes. Above all,
Illinois Park is committed to protecting individual liberty.
And Ms. Stowe's editorial failed to take seriously the life experiences
not just of the Palestinian people,
but of individuals on Park's very campus.
I wouldn't expect a school like Park--
or truthfully, any university--
to use the fact that it's privately funded
to cut off debate about how it treats its students.
Although, technically, it can.
Isn't the school the publisher here?
Yes, Geoffrey, it is.
You can't win this case.
I know.
Not with that argument.
I know.
It was a nice try, though.
What do you mean, not with that argument?
Is there another argument?
I came in here, and this campus
is like a city.
They've got their own campus police,
they've got medical facilities, food.
They have their own power plant, did you know that?
I didn't. But I'm not sure...
Have you heard of Evans v. Newton?
"State actor"?
Yeah.
Who are you?
Just your friendly neighborhood investigator.
No, that's a deep backwater of the law.
Where did you get that?
I dabble a bit now and then.
What do I have to do to get you to come and work for us?
I am working for you.
No, in an office. Full time.
With a desk. And lunches brought in.
I don't like offices.
Then without an office.
I don't know.
Make me an offer.
After you pled "Not guilty," Clayton, what happened then?
The judge slapped me with a six-figure bail.
And after arraignment, did you appear
before Judge Schakowsky again?
Yeah. Every couple months,
they'd stick me in the van, bring me over.
I'd be all ready for the trial,
and then the prosecutor'd ask for more time.
And the judge gave it?
He never even blinked.
Even though the prosecutor was delaying
to find the same witness?
Yes.
Isn't it true, Mr. Riggs,
that this wasn't your first criminal offense?
Objection. Mr. Riggs' past is irrelevant
to Schakowsky's immunity.
Goes to the issue of why Judge Schakowsky set bail so high.
Overruled.
In fact, didn't the Judge
in that weapons case have to issue a bench warrant
because you missed a court appearance?
That was a few years ago. I was young and dumb.
I turned myself in and I didn't screw up again.
Didn't you agree to each of the three continuances in your case?
No.
I never agreed.
Really?
Because I have transcripts of all three hearings,
and every one of them clearly notes:
"Continuance by agreement."
In your brochure for the school,
you write...
"Park intends to be a city within a city.
A student can shop, dine, and even go to a movie
without setting foot off the campus."
Is that true?
Indeed, Park is a good school--
an excellent one, in fact.
Thanks for pointing that out.
But by taking over these public functions,
Park has effectively become a "State actor"
and should be treated like a public school. Hasn't it?
That is a reach.
Not according to the Supreme Court.
Evans v. Newton,
Marsh v. Alabama.
If I'm not mistaken,
those cases are about company towns...
Yes, and that's exactly
what Park has become.
A state actor.
You're saying: the more the college takes on
governmental responsibilities,
the more it can be treated like an arm of the government.
Yes. But I'm not saying that, the Supreme Court is.
In which case the First Amendment would apply.
Yes, and Park cannot censor its paper.
Geoffrey, please...
Hang on.
Mr. Bukovitz, how many times
have you appeared before Judge Schakowsky?
Lots.
Did Judge Schakowsky ever use his position
to influence your representation of a client?
I don't even know what that means.
Did he ever yell to intimidate you?
Did he ever badger you to accept a plea deal?
No.
You know you're under oath, Mr. Bukovitz?
I-I do, Ms. Quinn,
but I also know Schakowsky is tough.
He wants to move fast.
But bond court requires it.
What does "Tax" Mean?
What?
Tax.
Not tax as in income tax.
But what does it mean when Schakowsky taxes you?
On June 18 of last year, did you tell me
that Schakowsky taxed you?
I-I don't remember.
There were three other witnesses.
I have the affidavits.
Look.
Sometimes-- and I mean sometimes--
Schakowsky flies off the handle
and says things that I'm sure he doesn't mean,
like he'll tax your client.
Meaning...?
Meaning he'll raise the bond amount.
But it's very rare.
And what did he raise the bond to
the time he taxed you?
$250,000.
Thank you, Mr. Bukovitz.
Let me take the cross.
It's a bad idea, Your Honor.
Not with this witness.
Trust me.
Your Honor.
Is Judge Schakowsky intending to question?
I am, actually. If Your Honor doesn't mind.
I don't, but I imagine you know all the reasons not to.
I do.
So I defer to your better judgment.
Have you ever practiced in front of Judge Falcone?
Or Judge Marc?
I... yes, a few times.
If you checked the clerk of the court's annual report,
you'd see they set bail, on average,
about ten percent higher than I do.
Objection, he's testifying.
Could you rephrase, Your Honor?
With pleasure.
Did you know they set bail, on average,
about ten percent higher than I did?
Your Honor,
these are very different cases.
They were felonies and...
Mrs. Florrick.
Please don't interrupt.
Thank you.
Did Mrs. Florrick ever argue that
I hurried her too much in court?
Objection, relevance.
It puts the motive of the plaintiff in context, Your Honor.
I'll allow it.
Yes, she did argue that.
Did you ever think I hurried you too much in court?
No.
Did you ever think I set bail too high?
No.
Did you ever think I badgered
the lawyers or their clients?
No.
Did you ever observe me
infringing on the civil rights of anyone?
No.
Thank you, Mr. Bukovitz.
Your Honor, I also have affidavits.
They're from dozens of lawyers in my court
supporting Mr. Bukovitz's observations.
Okay, thank you.
I don't need to hear any more here.
There's evidence that Judge Schakowsky is busy.
Perhaps even brusque.
But not that he exceeded his authority.
In which case, his immunity should remain intact.
The motion to dismiss is granted.
How was Silicon Valley?
It was warm.
I was surprised you were back.
Why didn't you call?
I came by.
Alicia didn't tell you?
No.
We need you on a case.
Are you sure?
I think Alicia was worried about the money.
What's the money?
$20 raise.
She was gonna check with you about it.
What did you do to her?
No.
I was in California.
Come on, you screwed with her head.
No, I didn't.
You did your smile thing.
Your bedroom eyes B.S.
"Oh, I'm just a guy's guy.
I don't know what I do to women."
Lucca, look at me.
I didn't do a thing.
Seriously.
Bernie?
What's up?
Clayton Riggs still wants to sue for his imprisonment.
I know. We're revising our strategy with Schakowsky.
We already did.
"We already did"?
What does that mean?
Clayton and me.
I met with him after you left court.
I signed him as a client.
You snaked him?
Yes.
We're also suing you for malpractice.
Ms. Lockhart has argued
that Illinois Park is a state actor.
We don't agree with this characterization
but think it's irrelevant.
Even in public colleges,
students don't have unfettered rights of expression.
Nothing my client has done rises to a level of...
"Schools are allowed to prohibit any expression
"that creates material and substantial disruptions
"in school activities
or invades the rights of others."
And do you have any evidence of such invasion or disruption?
Mr. Binazir, you requested
the school boycott Israeli goods from the settlements?
Yes.
Endorsing them is endorsing a decades-long occupation
that has led to thousands of deaths.
And how did you feel when the school
decided to boycott the products?
I felt heard and respected.
And how did you feel when Ms. Stowe
published her editorial?
Under attack,
disrespected, unsafe.
Here's what I don't understand, Mr. Binazir.
You're on a politically engaged campus.
How is this controversy different from all the others?
Black Lives Matter?
The Iraq War?
It's never got physical before.
Uh, my roommate was pushed to the ground and stepped on
just trying to get to class.
Okay, got it.
Ms. Lockhart?
Ms. Stowe,
was it your intent to disrupt student activities?
Not at all.
Was it your intent to infringe on the rights of other students?
No, I was just speaking my mind,
trying to engage them.
It's important for someone to present a contrary viewpoint.
At any cost?
No. But to be fair, the disruption Saum
is describing was temporary.
People are already settling down.
And in a few days,
they'll be on to the next crusade.
But you won't, because the only permanent disruption here
is leaving the school
without a freely functioning newspaper.
I did not commit malpractice.
It's not about you, it's about a payday.
A $1.2 million payday.
What's our malpractice cap?
$300,000.
Oh, God.
It was all we could afford.
So we fight.
What do they have?
I don't know.
We should put an investigator on it.
Should I call Jason?
I don't know.
He's probably too expensive.
We can probably talk him down.
I met him last night.
Why?
He's a friend.
How close a friend?
Seriously?
Are you gonna hate the whole world right now?
What did he say last night?
He said you were gonna talk to me about his raise.
I think we were both surprised that you hadn't talked to me.
Well, there was a lot going on.
A lot that would've been alleviated
by having an investigator.
What's going on, partner?
Would you like to talk?
I don't know anymore.
Do you want me to talk?
I was in love.
He died.
I found out he left me a message that he loved me,
but I didn't get it.
Now I'm sick to death of...
...everything.
This apartment.
This laundry.
The fact that things get dirty.
The law.
Just... standing here.
Sometimes I swear I just want to go into my bedroom,
pull the covers over my head,
and never do anything ever again.
I'm drinking like I never have before.
And all I want to do is have another one.
And then everything just gets swallowed up by
more disgust.
I'm not built to be an unhappy person.
I like laughing.
I laugh like a banshee
at videos on YouTube.
And then I just sit here
alone in this stupid little apartment...
wondering what the hell happened to my life.
Was it all about having two kids--
who I don't even know if I like anymore--
and just shoving them off to be someone important?
Seriously, was that the point?!
I just...
I-I hurt.
And I-I-I...
I want it over!
I just want it to end!
I just...
I was loved.
And it's...
over, over!
So why am I doing this?!
Alicia...
you are here
because I need you here.
I don't like people.
But I like you.
I don't even think I like my brother.
He bothers me.
I have no friends.
I'm 30 years old and I don't...
have a single friend.
But I want to be your friend.
I mean, do you have a ring or something?
I'll commit.
Because that's the one thing you can choose.
Me...
here wanting to be your friend.
Everything else is just handed to you.
All you have to do is say
I'm willing.
No, I'm-I'm serious.
You have to say it.
I'm-I'm willing.
Good.
Now, I have to ask you this.
Do you have any guns in this apartment?
No.
Good.
'Cause you scared me there for a minute.
You're gonna have to testify.
I know.
But you're gonna need another lawyer.
Who?
Cary Agos, Your Honor,
representing Alicia Florrick in this matter.
Cary Agos, Your Honor,
representing Alicia Florrick in this matter.
So the plaintiff is now the defendant.
A witness is now Mr. Riggs' attorney.
There seems to be a round of musical chairs
while I wasn't looking.
Yes, Your Honor, I spoke to Clayton,
and he wants to sue his lawyer, Mrs. Florrick.
And I guess you, Mrs. Florrick, you would move for dismissal?
Yes, we would, Your Honor.
Okay, this is exciting. Let's go.
Before the music stops and we're all in different chairs.
Who knows? I may be the plaintiff next.
So, Clayton, did Mrs. Florrick
ever take the time to consult with you about your plea?
Maybe 15 seconds.
Your bail?
The judge set it.
She tried to say something,
then she got nervous.
She didn't try to slow the proceedings down
or explain to you what was happening
and what your options were?
No.
No more questions, Your Honor.
Your current lawyer, Bernie Bukovitz,
he isn't actually your new lawyer, is he?
What do you mean?
He represented you in front of Judge Schakowsky before.
Oh, yeah, right.
He was my fourth lawyer.
And he didn't help you out any more
than Alicia Florrick did, did he?
No.
I'm sure everyone has sympathy for you, Mr. Riggs.
But isn't this really a case of bad luck?
And you just wanting to--
as you said to Mrs. Florrick-- sue somebody?
I just want to get out.
Yes, Mrs. Florrick
started as a bond lawyer in my court.
And did you have an opinion about her professionalism
or lack thereof?
Objection-- calls for a conclusion.
Expert witness.
Your Honor, the judge is an expert witness.
He's allowed to express his opinion.
Sustained. You may answer.
Yes, Mrs. Florrick did not demonstrate
the duty of care I would expect.
And if she had?
If she had informed me promptly and efficiently,
I might've had a better context to set Mr. Riggs' bail.
Should you have done more to try to pull
that information out of her?
My role is to adjudicate.
Not advocate.
All right, well, I went through the transcripts
from Schakowsky's courtroom, looking for abuses,
looking for any mention of taxing lawyers.
And?
Nothing.
Not a single mention of taxing.
He always covers the microphone when he says it.
Yep, that's kind of what I figured.
So, what, we're screwed?
No.
I talked to his courtroom reporter.
She hears everything. Darla.
A very nice lady.
She goes to the track every weekend.
It turns out Schakowsky talks really fast,
so she started recording him
so she could get every word.
And you have the tapes?
I do.
I wasn't myself earlier.
Things were swirling around in my head.
And now they're not?
Well, now they're in perspective.
Good.
Perspective is good.
I just, I didn't want you to think that...
Here's the thing, Alicia.
Whenever you worry about what I might be thinking,
or you worry that I'm upset about what you're thinking,
just know that... I'm fine.
Even when I'm not fine,
I'm really fine.
I got to go.
Are you still fine?
Yeah.
Do you remember when Mr. Bukovitz mentioned
that you taxed attorneys, Your Honor?
I do.
Is that a term you regularly use?
Only when discussing my income.
But not in the context of punishing an attorney
for not doing what you want.
No.
Not that I recall.
Good.
Then maybe this will refresh your recollection.
I simply want a plea, guilty or not guilty.
Uh, I-I need a moment to actually confer with my...
Objection!
You're a witness, you can't object.
I already warned you.
Objection, this is hearsay.
There's no foundation.
We have an affidavit
from the person who recorded this audio.
Yeah, I understand, if I could just...
I'm taxing you and your...
None of that matters.
I did not consent to being recorded.
Two-party consent isn't required.
Standard two-party consent isn't required but mine is.
That was recorded in my courtroom
where I forbid the use of recording devices.
It is the equivalent of you being recorded
right now in your court.
I agree, this tape is inadmissible.
Your Honor, that is completely self-serving.
No, Mrs. Florrick, this is a matter of respect.
The tapes are excluded.
Dean Randolph,
does the student handbook say,
"Park is dedicated to empowering students
by encouraging autonomy
and the development of personal responsibility"?
It does.
And did the student body demonstrate this responsibility
in their reaction to Ms. Stowe's editorial?
Oh, yes, they're the ones who petitioned the student council
to have Ms. Stowe removed and the paper defunded.
This was entirely a student body move?
Yes.
Thank you, Dean.
Do you agree with the way the students handled Imogen's oped?
I do.
And if you didn't?
Well, if the council voted one way or the other,
I'd respect it.
Part of learning how to make decisions
is learning how to live with poor decisions.
Last Halloween, you disciplined a student
for wearing a "Caitlyn" costume,
原名布鲁斯·詹纳 2015年变性为女
which you said made fun of trans students.
You did, not the student council.
Well, no one brought a petition to the student council,
but that didn't mean that the...
Yes, but before the council acts, after it acts,
whether it acts at all, you do.
The final responsibility rests with the adult faculty,
not the students.
If we could just look at chapter three of the student handbook...
I think we've all heard enough about the handbook, Ms. Reed.
Ms. Lockhart is right.
The administration is really still in charge,
and since we're considering them state actors,
they can't censor the newspaper.
The defunding of the student paper is hereby reversed.
Have a nice day, everyone.
We're adjourned.
Every attorney who comes to bond court has a learning curve,
but Mrs. Florrick's curve wasn't about being a good advocate.
What do you mean?
Well, she knew her way around a courtroom.
Judge Schakowsky liked to call her Marie Antoinette,
but she wasn't afraid to get her hands dirty
or ask for help when she needed it.
So what kind of learning curve was she on?
Figuring out how to deal with Schakowsky.
Thank you.
So you're saying Mrs. Florrick was as diligent
as any other lawyer in bond court?
Yes, Bernie, I am saying that.
Even though she had all sorts of other obligations?
I mean, wife of a governor who was running for president.
I think she handled it with aplomb.
Even though she missed a whole morning at bond court?
18 cases we had to cover,
so she could tape an episode of Mama's Homespun Cooking.
I'm not saying she didn't have to make trade-offs.
Trade-offs are one thing, but what about the time
you had to rush out of Judge Schakowsky's court
to cover a probate case of hers?
That was because of you, Bernie.
Because you didn't show up.
N-N-No, it wasn't my day.
It was your day...
You had given me...
Okay, thank you.
Thank you!
Any more questions, Counselor?
Just one more.
Didn't you tell Don Weingarten, another bond attorney,
that you feel sorry for anyone
who gets Alicia Florrick as an attorney?
I did.
But I don't believe that anymore.
I wouldn't be her law partner if I did.
You did end up with Will.
You act like I prevented the love affair of the ages,
but you two did end up together,
and I did not keep you from doing that.
Yes, I know I erased it, and I've already apologized.
And maybe you would have had
another three months together,
but that would have had no impact
on what happened to Will, none.
You can't control fate.
Just like I can't tell if I walked under that tree
and not this one, uh, the branch wouldn't break off and kill me.
And one more thing.
It was hard for me to apologize.
I never do that.
And I never confess to anything.
But I did to you.
Because I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I've never been more sorry about anything in my life.
Okay, Eli.
You're forgiven.
Really?
Yes.
I'll talk to you later, okay?
So what do you think?
There's not enough here for malpractice.
He'll sustain our motion to dismiss.
And if he doesn't?
We sit down and offer to settle.
All rise.
I find there is enough here to go to trial.
The motion to dismiss is denied.
$1.5 million.
Oh, come on.
Bernie, you know how this works.
You're never getting $1.5 million in a verdict,
and you're never getting $1.5 million from us.
So what can you accept?
$1.5 million.
And I disagree that I won't get it at trial.
I might even get more.
You're not well-liked, Alicia.
Well, we'll see you in court.
People think you're rich.
You're the wife of the governor
and the loser in the presidential primary.
He's not well-liked either.
$1.5 million.
Nice talking to you.
You've lost it, haven't you?
Oh, yes, I have.
Good news?
No. No, no, no.
Very bad news, actually.
Yep, we got shafted
by the brotherhood of the robe.
Our insurance doesn't even come close to covering this.
And we won't be able to afford our lawyer.
Last I looked, you two were lawyers.
Yes.
Two tired lawyers.
I'm heading home.
We'll talk tomorrow.
Yep.
I should go, too.
No, you should stay.
You should think things through with Alicia.
Are you still fine?
Yeah.
So a funny thing happened yesterday.
In the elevator?
Yeah. No, um, before that.
I got offered a job at Lockhart/Agos.
I said no, but they offered a lot of money.
And then you said yes.
No, because I didn't want to make it seem
like it was about us yesterday.
Ah, I see.
Well, you should do what's best for you.
Yeah, well, sometimes I can't tell what that is.
Well, it usually involves seeing which number is higher.
Yes.
So that didn't end well, did it?
No.
I heard from Lucca, they don't want to settle.
They don't.
And you're looking for a new place of business?
Yes.
Homeowners' association.
And we're looking for new associates.
Lost half in a bit of a rebellion.
Oh, God.
What?
Would it be so bad to come back?
As an associate?
No.
You want me back as a partner?
Diane would not want me back as a partner.
A junior partner.
You guys fired me.
No, we didn't.
That was Dipple.
And, anyway, his people like you a lot more
now that Peter lost the nomination, so...
Look.
We can help you cover any loss you experience.
Make it a part of your settlement.
Come on, Alicia.
Come on home.
