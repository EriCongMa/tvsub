hocky , a time honor tradition goldberg &apos;s games .
my dad raised us watching the flyers ,
dreamed us beem as cool and tough as the broad street bullies .
of course , what i lacked in size and strength ,
i made up for with clumsiness and asthma .
my costume is so uncomfortable .
it &apos;s a jersey , not a costume .
geez .
it didn &apos;t matter i was total scrub ,
my dad thought i could be great someday .
i didn &apos;t want let him down .
you ready ?
hell yeah .
i &apos;m ready to hockey it up .
there he is , my little ice angel .
remember our rule -- the real winner is safety .
it &apos;s the big leagues , bevy .
he &apos;s in junior peewee now .
this is the year that adam scores his first goal .
murray , i don &apos;t understand why you insist he plays .
adam , be careful on that ice . it &apos;s very slippery .
why don &apos;t you just skate around with him all game
and make sure he stays safe ?
i know you &apos;re joking , but i would do that
if the situation presented itself .
hockey wasn &apos;t my thing , but it was barry &apos;s everything .
whoo ! what a hit !
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s getting up .
i told you -- flyers got to hit to win .
i &apos;m freddy krueger !
i &apos;m gonna haunt your dreams , fool !
what &apos;s he doing ?
just ignore him .
he &apos;ll wear himself out .
that &apos;s enough . that &apos;s enough .
let me watch the game . stop .
just watch the game , adam .
my dad took hockey very seriously ,
and my brother , barry , did , too .
out of all the things he thought he was good at ,
this one he actually was .
goal !
and my dad loved going to his games .
look at you ! look at you !
but when it came to my games , not so much .
go , adam !
even so , my dad dragged his ass to those stands to cheer me on .
no , no ! the other way !
but he never stopped believing
that one day i would score that first goal
and live up to the goldberg potential .
do something !
then , it finally happened .
my moment -- my big shot to make my dad proud .
or so i thought .
yes ! i finally scored !
yeah .
damn it , goldberg . you scored on our goal .
i call a do @-@ over !
that &apos;s a thing in sports , right ?
it was february 25 , 1980 @-@ something .
my sister was prepping for the s.a.t.s ,
and my mom was gonna be there every step of the way
with words of support and encouragement .
okay , i don &apos;t want to make a big deal about this ,
but your entire life
is literally riding on this one test .
you &apos;ve made that very clear .
now stop hovering .
sorry . i &apos;ll just be quietly over here .
what the hell ?
this test is all about how you handle distraction .
focus your mind .
shut out the world .
mom .
i don &apos;t think there are going to be
any explosions at the test center .
you don &apos;t know that .
it could be underneath a discotheque ,
or next to a fireworks factory ,
or in a bad part of south philly ,
like where your gym teacher got arrested .
you &apos;re not helping .
and time ! pencils down .
okay , you didn &apos;t even answer the last 10 questions .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
you &apos;re what &apos;s wrong with me !
you know what ?
that &apos;s fine . i &apos;m done for the night .
the night has just begun , missy .
tuchus down , now .
look , my s.a.t. tutor said that taking
too many practice tests will burn you out .
and that &apos;s why i fired her .
you fired wendy woo ?
i fired wendy woo .
she was happy and kind and patient --
three terrible qualities in a tutor .
but don &apos;t worry . i hired someone else .
she &apos;ll be here momentarily .
what ? what &apos;s happening ?
surprise !
no .
it &apos;s me ! i &apos;m your new tutor !
stop doing what you &apos;re doing .
erica , the fate of your college career
rides on this one single test , and trust me ,
i know how important college is .
the biggest regret of my life is dropping out to have you .
oh , that sounded awful .
i am just gonna keep on talking until it fixes itself .
has it fixed itself ?
no .
i think it has . here .
i &apos;ve gone through tests from the past 10 years
and compiled all the most difficult math problems .
do them now .
what ? these are way too hard .
i believe in you .
while my mom was turning the screws on erica ,
my dad had given up on me .
what are you doing ? the flyers are on .
i got news for you , albert .
i &apos;m done with hockey . that &apos;s right .
adam spoiled the whole sport for me .
it happens .
sometimes the puck deflects off you
and ricochets into your own goal .
no . he aimed . he shot .
he scored . he danced !
i &apos;m so sorry .
why don &apos;t you just let the boy quit ?
he hates hockey .
for now .
but when i force him to play against his will ,
he &apos;ll eventually become great .
and then his bitterness towards me will turn into love .
that , my friend , is what it means to be a dad .
yes , that &apos;s very touching .
but maybe you should do something
that adam likes for a change .
but he likes space ships and dragons and video games .
did you know that the mario brothers
aren &apos;t even real ?
for three years , i thought they were the boys
who lived across the street .
just give it a shot .
i think you &apos;ll see that kid is into some pretty cool stuff .
hey , dad , check it out .
doesn &apos;t it look like i &apos;m in zero gravity ?
yeah . so , this is what you do , huh ?
making a sci @-@ fi movie .
yeah , space stuff .
you ever do any westerns or gritty cop dramas ?
no , not my genres .
although , technically , star wars was a western ,
and robocop was incredibly dark .
so just space stuff .
well , you need a hand ?
really ?
yeah , sure . i &apos;ll , um , hold the camera or something .
do you want to act in it ?
do i ?
awesome !
lie down on the bed , and whatever happens , don &apos;t move .
lie down and don &apos;t move .
what do you know , i &apos;ve been an actor my whole life .
okay .
in a nutshell , you &apos;re caine , a space miner
who has an alien egg gestating in your belly .
i &apos;m who with the what ?
get ready to freak out .
why would i freak out ?
what are you doing ?
why would you do that ?
stop !
what is that ? ! get it out !
stop !
stop talking . you &apos;re dead .
you ruined my one good shirt ! you &apos;re dead !
dad , i told you there was an alien egg in your stomach .
what do you think that means ?
you know what ? let &apos;s go back to hockey .
that , i understand .
while my dad &apos;s attempt at bonding was an utter failure ,
my mom was pushing erica to the next level .
how did i do already ?
okay , just know that this is a practice test
and we still have a lot of work to do .
son of a bitch . that bad ?
1,280 .
what ?
you better come over here and hug your mama
before i punch you in the face .
oh , my god !
i thought you were just talking like a crazy person
like you do every other second of the day .
but you actually helped me boost my score by like 100 points !
you &apos;re damn right i did .
and that &apos;s good enough to get you into penn .
forget penn . that &apos;s good enough for stanford .
wait , what ?
yeah , i need a 1,300 to get in .
only 20 more points to go .
stanford is in california .
i know . it &apos;s so far away .
you are not going to school 20,000 miles away from me --
us . the family .
you seriously won &apos;t let me go
to one of the best colleges in the country ?
i ...
what the hell was that ?
i ...
stop .
i ...
stop doing that .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t help it .
i @-@ i @-@ it -- stanford &apos;s just so far away .
i ... i wouldn &apos;t be able to just pop in on the weekends ,
and -- and hang out with you and your girlfriends
and try on clothes and then have you take me
to the local college pubs , where you introduce me
as your older sister barbie to the cute t.a.s.
that &apos;s your plan ?
one of them , yeah .
well , thank god i learned how to kick ass on this test .
thank god .
what have i done ?
well look who it is .
try not to score on your own goal , lame gretzky .
mayb instead of being a total putz ,
you could actually help me ?
you want my help ? quit .
quitting isn &apos;t an option .
you know how much it matters to dad .
i don &apos;t want to let him down .
if i cared at all , that would make me sad .
maybe you could teach me something ,
so then , when i look in the stands ,
dad &apos;s not hiding his face in shame .
what i got can &apos;t be taught . it &apos;s called natural talent .
see , i &apos;m the type of player
who controls the flow of the game .
you , on the other hand , are a turd on ice .
i know ! but there &apos;s got to be something i can do .
i guess you could always be a goon .
a goon ? like in &quot; goonies &quot; ?
a goon -- an enforcer .
they protect the awesome players like me
using violence and dirty play .
as long as they can kick butt ,
a goon doesn &apos;t need to shoot or score .
teach me . i am yours to mold .
please . teach me how to be a goonie .
goon !
can we just say goonie if it helps me get there ?
that meant yes , barry would help me .
all i had to do now was learn how to fight .
realizing a good test score meant losing her daughter ,
my mom changed her tutoring tactics .
hey , study buddy .
what &apos;s all this ?
i just wanted some coffee so i could stay up and study .
well , you &apos;re in luck ,
because nothing keeps your energy up
like warm milk and a big pile of turkey .
don &apos;t those things put you to sleep ?
no , no . the opposite is true .
i read that in a magazine i threw away .
well , you got me this far . i trust you .
oh , you &apos;re sweet .
oh , listen , i was thinking ,
as a reward for all your hard work ,
you might want to let off some steam
and go to see rick springfield on friday night .
but that &apos;s the night before the test .
okay .
your loss , egghead .
well , i should probably get back to work .
oh , about that , um , i made up
some new vocab cards for you to memorize .
this should get you the extra points
you need to get into stanford .
oh , thanks , mom .
&quot; scubulence , noun --
the process of removing scuba equipment from a boat . &quot;
weird word .
yeah , weird and real . just like &quot; flimjam , verb --
to run backwards in a zig @-@ zag pattern . &quot;
got it .
well , that makes me feel very &quot; torkulent , adjective --
delighted and a little scared . &quot;
well , let me just flimjam out of here
and , uh , good luck with your studying .
&quot; fidangle , verb -- to finish dangling . &quot;
what the hell ?
she wouldn &apos;t .
she would .
while my mom was trying to hurt erica &apos;s chances on the s.a.t. ,
barry was teaching me how to hurt people on the ice .
okay , ad rock , listen up .
there are a few crucial things you need to learn
in order to be an enforcer .
i &apos;m ready for this . teach me .
we &apos;ll start with the basics .
lesson one -- this is your stick .
people like me use it to score .
people like you use it as a weapon .
cool . like a sword .
i can use the moves i learned in my stage @-@ combat class .
lesson two -- every time you say something like that ,
you get a nerd punch in the meaty part of your arm .
smart . the pain will motivate me .
nerd punch !
lesson three -- your stick is to never touch the ice .
it &apos;s used for slashing , hooking , butt @-@ ending , and spearing .
any questions ?
aren &apos;t all those penalties ?
nerd punch !
lesson four -- fighting .
but i didn &apos;t learn lessons one through three yet .
maybe you did , maybe you didn &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t .
or did you ?
i didn &apos;t !
nerd punch !
now , the trick to a hockey fight is the first person
who sheds their gloves strikes first .
go ! again !
come on , hurry , hurry , hurry .
again !
quick , quick , quick , quick , quick !
you &apos;re gonna lose to a kid with looser gloves .
again !
i think i got it now .
you got it when i say you got it .
which is now .
lesson five , and the most important lesson of them all --
when you &apos;re in a fight ,
you grab the bottom of your opponent &apos;s jersey
and yank it over his head , like so .
stop it ! i can &apos;t see !
good . you &apos;re learning .
lesson six -- watch out for elbows .
there &apos;s my little genius .
you all geared up for the big test tomorrow ?
all thanks to your help .
you know , i thought a lot about what you said ,
and i decided that penn is a great choice for me .
oh , it &apos;s happening .
we &apos;re going to penn !
i know !
i &apos;m so excited that i decided to get a head start
on my essay for their application .
here it is .
&quot; i believe that the university of pennsylvania
is the right school for me .
because of its torkulent history and diligord reputation . &quot;
oh , boy .
don &apos;t stop . keep going .
ah , i &apos;d rather not .
okay , pops , would you mind ?
&quot; i feel that i could really benefit
from being part of its cromtormulous student body
and weepeggle faculty . &quot;
weepeggle ? what the ...
keep reading .
&quot; i would be bumgubbled to quarp a university
that is so vernaciously proggle
that even the most zeticent student could gobulate . &quot;
gobulate ?
honest question -- when you wrote this ,
were you smoking a jazz cigarette ?
oh , it &apos;s much worse than that .
i have a mother that taught me fake vocab words
to screw me out of the college i want to go to .
what ? that &apos;s crazy .
that is crazy , right ?
i can explain .
oh , no .
what kind of mother sabotages her daughter ?
who does that ?
just go to penn .
it &apos;s only 20 minutes away .
i can cook for you and do your laundry
and clean your room because it &apos;s only 20 minutes away ,
so you should live here and commute .
oh , well , i &apos;ve got news for you .
california ain &apos;t far enough away .
i &apos;m going to japan university .
that &apos;s right . good luck popping in on me there .
do you really think that &apos;ll stop me ?
i &apos;ll fly halfway around the planet
just to see you every weekend if i have to .
fine ! then i &apos;ll just colonize the moon
and go to college there !
then i &apos;ll get on a rocket every weekend
just so i can give you a hug .
you can &apos;t do that !
oh , i can .
and i will bring you tang and i &apos;ll iron your space suit
and i &apos;ll take your alien roommates to bennigans !
i hate that you love me so much !
while my mom and erica had taken the gloves off ,
i was about to do the same .
nooo !
this wasn &apos;t the plan !
fight back , adam !
use your stick , just like i taught you !
you taught him what ?
nothing . i taught him nothing .
no , no , stop ! i &apos;m the enforcer .
you can &apos;t enforce the enforcer .
ball up !
curl into a ball !
dear god , no !
adam ! get back here . we need to talk .
no . just leave me alone .
this is your fault , you moron .
i &apos;m a moron ?
adam &apos;s the one who got suspended for fighting .
yeah , you &apos;re the one who taught him how to fight !
i was trying to help him .
all he wanted to do was impress you .
how &apos;s it supposed to impress me
to have him dragged by the face
and turned into a human hockey puck ?
i don &apos;t know .
you won &apos;t let him quit ,
so what else is he supposed to do ?
do you know why i won &apos;t let him quit ?
you and i have a ton in common .
we talk about sports , food , cars .
but adam -- this is all we &apos;ve got ,
and if you take hockey away , there &apos;s a good chance
that adam and i might never speak again .
i see what you &apos;re saying .
i &apos;m your favorite son .
didn &apos;t say that .
i get it .
no , you don &apos;t .
you love me more .
you &apos;re an idiot .
you can say it all you want .
you &apos;re an idiot .
but we all know how you really feel .
you &apos;re an idiot .
i get it .
just stop .
okay .
listen , i know adam &apos;s hobbies are weird to us .
no . weird to everyone .
but the kid tried for five years to do your thing .
maybe now it &apos;s time to try his thing
for more than five minutes .
that &apos;s pretty smart , barry .
of course ! i &apos;m your favorite .
and back to stupid .
poopie , can mama come in ?
let me guess .
you &apos;re here with &quot; directions &quot;
to the new test center that doesn &apos;t exist ?
i &apos;m here to apologize .
what i did was wrong .
you know , you always say you want what &apos;s best for your children ,
but , really , you just want what &apos;s best for you .
okay , i was selfish .
but ... i just love you so much .
i never want to let you go .
and you think that that &apos;s
supposed to make what you did any better ?
look ... i know you &apos;re gonna go off to college one day ,
but the reality of you moving all the way across the country
and starting a whole new life , that freaked me out .
but i know this isn &apos;t about me ,
so if stanford is what you want , then , damn it ,
we are gonna get you into stanford .
do you mean that ?
i don &apos;t .
understood .
but i &apos;ll work on it .
and maybe in a year or so ... i will .
you know , um ... i never finished college ,
so i could always apply .
don &apos;t ruin the hug .
okay .
hey . how you doing ?
well , i discovered the only thing worse
than scoring on your own goal
is getting scored into your own goal .
look , i know you &apos;re not enjoying hockey ,
and i &apos;m not enjoying you not enjoying hockey ,
so i thought , &quot; there has to be
something else we can do together . &quot;
please don &apos;t make me play football .
no , no , no . no sports . done with sports .
so , i went to the store , and i got you
a family @-@ size bottle of ketchup
and a three pack of t @-@ shirts for you to ruin ,
in case you want to give that alien movie thing another try .
you mean it ?
yeah . why not ?
well , if we do this , we do it right .
oh ! oh , my god !
call the robot president !
my dad learned that , while i was nothing like him ,
he could meet me halfway , and even though
i didn &apos;t play hockey anymore , he still had barry ...
goal !
oh , yeah ! all , man !
... which was a mixed bag .
put it in , scorekeeper . put it in .
as for erica , she was feeling quite torkulent
as she sat down to take the s.a.t.
nothing would stop her , not even fireworks .
and begin .
mail just came .
oh , my god !
i knew you could do it .
i may actually go to california .
i &apos;ll follow you to the moon , baby .
in the end , my parents realized all they could do
was let us be who we wanted to be and just enjoy the ride .
and we &apos;re rolling . &quot; alien dad -- the sequel . &quot;
okay , here &apos;s the backstory .
you &apos;re a space miner about to explore
an alien vessel all by yourself .
by myself ? an alien vessel ? no , no , no , no .
let &apos;s just send in a dog or something . - a dog ?
we &apos;ll give it a flashlight . strap a camera on its back .
you &apos;re on a solo mission . there is no dog .
only a moron would go on a ship by himself .
well , you &apos;re going in there , so i guess you &apos;re a moron .
how are things going in here ?
he &apos;s refusing to go on the alien ship .
murray , just go in the damn ship .
fine ! i will go in the damn ship .
good , &apos; cause now an alien attacks your face
and implants an egg inside your belly .
well , that &apos;s exactly the reason i didn &apos;t want to go in .
