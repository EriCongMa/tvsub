why there are giant lolipops all over the front yard ?
and why they taste so bad ?
because they are made of cardboard , mouth breather .
hey , the world needs more dreamers , luke
never stop licking things .
i know it &apos;s lame ,
but after last year we promised the neighbours
we would keep our decorations more family friendly .
we can &apos;t carve a pumpkin ?
the petition was very specific .
every halloween , we have the best house .
last year , i took things to a whole new level .
but appearently it &apos;s too scary for some kids .
and one adult .
trick @-@ or @-@ treat !
would you like some candy ?
yeah !
or would you rather have this ?
come on . you &apos;re fine .
i don &apos;t care what anyone says .
you did not give that man a heart attack .
thank you .
i mean , you &apos;re not even scary .
can i grab a little bit of this candy
for my open house tonight ?
uh , yeah , sure , but ...
it &apos;s genius . an open house on halloween .
millions of bored parents ,
just trying to keep their ... kids out of traffic .
now they can get away from all that ,
and see a nice house .
what do you mean , i &apos;m not even scary ?
i literally almost scared the life out of a man .
you literally scared a little saliva
and a little urine out of him .
that happens to me every time i see a monkey wearing people clothes .
i was plenty scary .
i used professional @-@ grade makeup .
that &apos;s the point , claire . it was overkill .
you &apos;re the kind of person
who can be twice as scary without wearing any makeup . bye .
you remembered to pick up the costumes , right ?
yes , they &apos;re right over there .
very excited .
cam has lost a lot of weight--
no .
so we &apos;re throwing a halloween party
to debut the new him .
i &apos;ll be dressed as a matador .
wh @-@ what is it now , 30 ?
32.4
so i &apos;ve lost lily .
where is lily ?
do you--you don &apos;t have her ?
no .
why would i have her ?
i don &apos;t have her in my pocket .
cam ?
what about the tiara ?
uh , we didn &apos;t buy one .
you can just use the one from last year .
are we poor ?
no , sweetheart , but you don &apos;t need two tiaras .
how about next halloween you try a different costume ?
no . i have to be a princess .
every year ? why ?
because my mom &apos;s a princess ,
just like you told me .
cam and i have always known that someday ,
we were gonna have to have the big talk with lily ,
about who her mom was .
we--we were gonna pick the right time
and do it together ,
carefully following an agreed @-@ upon script .
then i got tired .
&quot; and she was the most beautiful princess in all the land .
the end . &quot;
again .
why is tyler &apos;s mommy so fat ?
oh , that &apos;s because she has-- she has a baby in her belly .
okay ? good night .
was i in my mom &apos;s belly ?
lily , no more questions , all right ?
just--just go to sleep .
where &apos;s my mom now ?
um , she &apos;s ...
in a faraway land .
why ?
because she &apos;s a princess .
and she &apos;s ... very , very busy .
okay .
i thought that she &apos;d forget about it by the next morning .
i mean , i did .
oh , i knew i was gonna have to tell cam ,
and he was gonna be furious ,
but i was hoping that he &apos;d see the bigger issue .
you know , i was really tired .
hey , cam , you know this whole thing
about lily wanting to be a princess again ?
well , i @-@ i think it might be because i let her believe
her mother was--
this is a nightmare .
it was just a mistake .
more like a disaster .
they sent the matador costume in your size ,
and the bull costume in mine .
oh . i didn &apos;t notice . um ...
now no one &apos;s gonna see my bod
in this bulky bull costume .
it was--it was honestly a mistake .
l @-@ listen , um , you--you could do that other thing that you thought of .
you could put on that gorgeous white suit
that fits you so well now ,
and you could be mr. roarke ,
and lily could be your tattoo .
no ! i have to be a princess !
oh , but , lily , you were a princess last year .
no ! you promised ! i &apos;m being a princess !
why is she so obsessed with princesses ?
well ...
like we weren &apos;t at that age ?
i mean ...
i &apos;m not mad about the ticket .
it &apos;s just the first time i couldn &apos;t charm my way
out of one of these things .
the way i see it , it &apos;s not a ticket .
it &apos;s a conversation .
no offense . you don &apos;t need that siren .
you could stop traffic just getting out of that squad car .
license and registration , please .
i , uh ...
i &apos;m no stranger to the police academy myself .
seen all seven of them .
sir , no one &apos;s seen all seven .
is this information accurate ?
yeah .
uh , except for the weight .
i thought they wanted to know how much i could curl .
i must be getting rusty with my moves .
moves ? what moves ?
you know , flash the baby blues ,
hit &apos; em with the devilish grin .
in case of emergency , break glass
and bust out the dimple .
hey , isn &apos;t that one from the smallpox ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m 100 . chicken pox .
and it doesn &apos;t matter where it &apos;s from .
it always worked .
hey , mom .
manny , why are you coming back from school so late ?
i got sent to the principal &apos;s office .
oh . i am sending him an angry e @-@ mail ,
because i don &apos;t like when--
no , no , no . it &apos;s not his fault .
what did you do wrong ?
nothing .
oh , that &apos;s it . i &apos;m calling him .
i hate when he tries to--
nothing on purpose .
it was between periods , right before this big test .
i was clearing my mind by practicing
some of my gene kelly dance moves .
as one does .
right .
and my umbrella accidentally snagged the fire alarm .
the principal thought i did it on purpose
so we &apos;d miss the test .
but you didn &apos;t !
that &apos;s it ! i &apos;m going to his house !
mom ! you gotta stop doing this .
i &apos;m not sure if it &apos;s the pregnancy ,
which we both know isn &apos;t your fault ...
but lately you &apos;ve been such a hothead .
i am not a hothead ! i am colombian .
we get excited .
my country is covered in coffee .
just like the starbucks girl
when she got your order wrong ?
half @-@ caf , non @-@ fat wet soy latte .
how hard is that to hear ? !
you don &apos;t get to be 2 @-@ time nonconsecutive
district salesman of the year without thinking inside the box .
that &apos;s right . i said &quot; inside . &quot;
you know why ? &apos; cause while everyone &apos;s
chasing each other around outside the box ,
you know what the box is ?
empty .
which brings us back to our formal dining room .
now any questions ?
can we have our candy now ?
just as soon as we go over
what you &apos;re gonna tell your parents .
now what was our style ?
pre @-@ war craftsman .
good , good . and how many square feet ?
3,500 .
still no trick @-@ or @-@ treaters ?
not yet .
well , maybe people are going out later this year .
well , the street &apos;s full of kids ,
but they &apos;re actively detouring around our house .
move along .
who wants some candy ?
plenty of name @-@ brand ...
family @-@ friendly candy right here .
oh ! it &apos;s a trap !
no . i--ooh , how about you ? hey--
you want some candy , right ? come on ,
have some candy !
mom ! mommy , she &apos;s got me !
no , i don &apos;t-- i &apos;m not trying--
my candy !
just leave it !
jay , you have to get ready for mitch and cam &apos;s party .
gloria , does my skin look looser to you ?
what ?
maybe i should try some of that fancy neck cream of yours .
don &apos;t you have some with specks of diamonds in it or something ?
trick @-@ or @-@ treat .
you guys don &apos;t even have costumes .
i &apos;m a skeleton .
and i &apos;m--i &apos;m a lemon .
aren &apos;t you too old to be trick @-@ or @-@ treating ?
aren &apos;t you too old to be having a baby ?
ah , you find that funny , lemon ?
here &apos;s a better joke .
knock , knock . what &apos;s gone ?
your candy !
what was that ?
some rude dummies , that they think that they can--
all right , listen . let &apos;s just calm down .
get ready for the party .
calm down what ?
you think i &apos;m a hothead , like manny ?
no !
you can be emotional . volatile , maybe .
still , that &apos;s a far cry from--
you put egg on my house ,
i kill what you love !
psycho .
plush utility room ?
yeah , right .
i know a hall closet when i see one .
and your dad never lies ?
what medical school
did the great appliance doctor attend ?
hey , delgado .
oh , no ! durkas !
what i wouldn &apos;t give for this umbrella to have
mary poppins &apos; powers .
oh , i pray he didn &apos;t hear that .
heard you pulled the fire alarm today
and got us out of that test .
good job .
thanks , mr. durkas .
you know what ? you don &apos;t need to call me that anymore .
anyway , we &apos;re all meeting at the playground at 8 : 00
and heading out , if you want to join .
you &apos;re totally going to that .
yeah , if you want to ruin your reputation .
you &apos;re finally gonna be in with the cool kids .
you need to talk at the school assembly on monday
and apologize to all the teachers .
teachers . more like public sector parasites .
be strong , manny .
be smart . adventures , parties .
juvie , heartache .
girls !
but not the kind we want .
they &apos;re all the kind we want .
mr. dur--
conrad !
take one . i &apos;m an egg donor .
i love your costume , too , cam . adora @-@ bull .
oh , well , thank you . it &apos;s all in fun .
i half @-@ wanted to wear something tighter .
you know , i &apos;ve been reducing .
i can see .
well , you say it like you can &apos;t .
no , no , no . i totally can .
impressive , huh ?
yeah . i &apos;m--i &apos;m gonna ...
hey , cam .
mm ?
i &apos;m hearing a rumor that you keep flashing our guests .
oh , well , not in a perverted way .
i just want people to see my body
under this stupid costume .
that &apos;s very close to what actual flashers say .
daddy ?
yeah , one second , honey .
i &apos;m just tired of throwing out compliments
and not getting anything back .
i told roberto his spray tan looked real .
look for yourself . it &apos;s on two of our pillows and our cat .
daddy . yeah ?
lookit . it &apos;s my mommy . she came .
oh . oh , no , honey , that &apos;s not your mommy .
it &apos;s not ?
no , no . that &apos;s just one of daddy &apos;s friends .
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , nothing .
she just wants one of these cupcakes .
but i already had ...
oh , there you go , honey .
okay , off you go . mingle ! mingle !
looks like some people came by .
yeah . oh , yeah , we had a few .
i saw that .
hello ?
hey , honey .
hi . how &apos;s your open house ?
pretty empty , actually .
i kind of just took it out
on a harry potter .
seriously , though , a gryffindor
letting his mom carry his quidditch broom ?
how hufflepuff is that ?
it &apos;s pretty lonely here , too .
we have been shunned by the whole neighborhood .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
all over some mild little gag you pulled ?
it was not mild . there was an investig ...
oh , i @-@ i thought i heard someone .
i guess it was just trees tapping against the window .
it &apos;s pretty creepy over here in this rattly old house .
anyway , i &apos;ll probably give it another 30 minutes ,
then i &apos;ll see you at home .
okay . bye .
what are you laughing about ?
oh , it &apos;s just your poor dad , you know .
your poor , dumb dad .
i &apos;ll fill you in at the staff meeting
after keneally &apos;s done telling us about his morning commute .
that &apos;s hilarious ! you sound just like him .
you are so doing that at christmas talent night .
dude , &quot; rich girl , &quot; &quot; sara smile ... &quot;
then a &quot; maneater &quot; encore .
it was scary how good they were .
close your eyes , it could have been the real band .
yeah , he got lucky in the football pool once ,
and now he wants to double the stakes .
oh , i &apos;m so scared !
right ?
well , this night was a bust .
not a single person even ...
or did i speak too soon ?
was someone in the mood to be a bad little ghoul ?
oh , connie , i didn &apos;t mean you .
i &apos;m ... hey , that &apos;s just ... that &apos;s just the divorce talking .
hang in there .
bye @-@ bye .
well , someone decided to take a trip
to fantasy island after all .
well , i &apos;m tired of people not noticing my new physique .
if this doesn &apos;t work , i &apos;m breaking out the diaper
and top hat and going as baby new year ! hello .
oh , my god !
you look amazing .
thanks !
that &apos;s what happens when you lose 100 pounds .
oh , come on . what a ...
who wants to lift me ?
me .
come on . how could he have not called us ?
oh , my god , he &apos;s as light as a feather .
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna go lift him
and shake him till his staples pop .
cam , stop !
just saying that we could have caught those kids .
what , and chase them around all night ?
i &apos;m not a young man anymore ,
as the world keeps pointing out .
what did that waiter just call you outside ?
medieval knievel .
that is hilarious .
i love when people put some thought into their outfit .
illegal alien , sugar daddy .
why do you say &quot; illegal &quot; ?
because antennas are alien , and you &apos;re ...
what ? illegal ?
because of the color of my skin ?
why don &apos;t i dump your baby in your gas tank ?
gloria ! uh , no hard feelings , please .
just enjoy the party , okay ?
first of all , relax . we &apos;re at a party .
secondly , you &apos;ve been deported twice .
you &apos;re not allowed to be that defensive .
what is it with me lately ?
manny &apos;s right . i &apos;m such a hothead .
it happens . you &apos;re pregnant .
that &apos;s what it is , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s the baby . it &apos;s angry in there .
no !
yes !
you just said it yourself . i have changed .
i have an angry baby inside of me making me do bad things !
it &apos;s just hormones .
it &apos;s your mama bear instinct kicking in .
所以把情绪激烈的孕期母亲称作熊妈妈 &#93;
and that &apos;s a good thing ,
because that means you &apos;re gonna be a great mom--again .
do you really think so ?
you got a lucky little kid in there .
he &apos;s got a mom who &apos;s not gonna let anyone harm him .
or her .
or--or him .
trick @-@ or @-@ treat .
go ahead .
you better run !
oh , my gosh ,
is that the most precious thing you &apos;ve ever seen ?
oh , my god .
do you know other princesses ?
trust me . i know lots .
okay . bedtime .
oh , no , it &apos;s not that late .
do you know my mom ? she &apos;s a princess .
she &apos;s exhausted .
she &apos;s not making sense . she &apos;s so tired .
daddy , you told me !
what is she talking about , mitchell ?
my real mom . she is , right ?
okay , i think we need to have a little talk .
sam , do you notice how slim cam &apos;s getting ?
nice try . i will be back for that answer .
this isn &apos;t gonna work , claire ...
&apos;cause i know you &apos;re here .
what &apos;s the plan , anyway ?
you gonna pop out at me ?
it &apos;s gonna take more than that to scare this--
hello ? !
hi !
is the house still open ?
oh , yes ! yes ! i &apos;ll be right down .
claire , this is serious ! i have a job !
not that you don &apos;t . you work 24 / 7
and you don &apos;t get half the appreciation you deserve .
can we talk about this later ?
as you potential buyers can see ,
this is a , uh , a beautiful home .
what &apos;s behind here ?
oh , i wouldn &apos;t go in there !
unless you love formal dining rooms .
honey , look at this .
i &apos;m in the kitchen .
oh , we should probably stay together .
come on , sheila .
phil , one question . are these--
wait , wait .
i just love to see people &apos;s reactions
when i show them--
so much storage . what ? it &apos;s crazy !
i think you guys will find that this house
is full of so many ... delightful surprises
that you &apos;ll be happy here for--
oh , my god !
i don &apos;t know her !
is this the original tub ?
what ? yes , it is .
it is , uh , the original tub .
um , original fixtures , beveled mirror ,
just a @-@ a huge stall shower .
if you guys would , uh , want to have a party .
i &apos;m kidding , of course .
but , um , just a house with a real personality .
we &apos;ll be right in , sweetie .
we agreed to tell lily about her mother together ,
wearing calming earth tones ,
and we agreed to tell her the truth .
i know , but haven &apos;t you ever said something dumb to lily
that you wish she would just forget ?
this isn &apos;t about me . let &apos;s just fix this .
okay , great . although ...
the way you agreed so quickly makes me wonder
what sort of things you &apos;ve told her .
i may have told her her fibs kills birds .
wow . we &apos;re coming back to that one .
oh , hi , princess .
hey , lil . could we talk to you for a second ?
am i in trouble ?
oh , gosh , no . of course not , sweetie .
um ... well , do you remember how we used to tell you
there was a heaven for all the flowers that die ?
what do you mean , &quot; used to &quot; ?
sorry , i let it slip . we &apos;ll deal with it later .
much much are you not telling me ?
why are you talking like this ?
daddies took a little side trip .
sorry , sweetie .
um , so sometimes , uh ,
we tell you things like that to make you feel better .
and i might have done the same thing
when i told you that your mom is a princess .
so she &apos;s not ?
well , you know what ?
she might be .
she might be .
but we can &apos;t know for sure , honey ,
because ... well , we don &apos;t know where she is
or ... what she &apos;s doing .
b @-@ but what--what we do know
is that she loved you very , very much ...
and she knew that she couldn &apos;t take care of you ,
so she made sure that you went
with the most loving family she could find .
and that &apos;s how the three of us became a family .
does that make sense , sweetie ?
do you have any questions for us ?
why did you say a fib and kill a bird ?
i noticed you walking in with your wife earlier .
she &apos;s stunning .
you know my favorite part of that compliment ?
you knew she was my wife .
half the world thinks she &apos;s my daughter .
well , if you ask me , she &apos;s a lucky girl .
bummer for me , though .
handsomest man in here , and he &apos;s taken .
i &apos;ll bet you do all right with the boys .
i do .
it &apos;s the men i &apos;m interested in .
you just put it all right out there , don &apos;t you ?
i always try to hold a little something back .
oh , my gosh .
no , no , no , no , no , no . leave him .
no , but you know that &apos;s a--
i know . he needs this .
okay .
it was great meeting you , jay .
you , too , sam .
wow ! looks like somebody really likes you .
what can i say ? i still got it .
i &apos;ve been meaning to ask you-- have you lost some weight ?
because you look good .
wow , you have no idea
what that means to hear from you , jay .
uh , turn it that way .
i thought this might cheer you up .
da plane ! da plane !
baby girl !
look you ! you even taught her the catchphrase .
yeah . jay , have you seen my new tattoo ?
be in touch .
well , thanks so much for coming .
yeah . thanks .
okay .
okay , claire , they &apos;re gone . you can come out now .
claire ?
honey , i &apos;m sorry i said you weren &apos;t scary .
it &apos;s been such a long day .
can we please just go home ?
all right . i &apos;m leaving without ya .
so ... this remote you know how to use .
yes ?
phil , where are you ?
claire ? where are you ?
i came over to scare you , but then i heard you
showing the house to that couple ,
so i got out of your way .
are you at home ?
yeah . i got here ten minutes ago .
s @-@ so ... so you &apos;re saying ...
this call isn &apos;t coming from inside the house ?
what are you talking about ? just get home .
the kids and i are hungry .
yeah , hurry up , dad .
we miss you !
miss you , too , buddy .
trick @-@ or @-@ treat !
i wasn &apos;t really that scared .
okay .
hey , you never told me if you hit those kids with that egg .
they blended into the crowd ,
but there was a slow one with them .
he couldn &apos;t run so fast ,
and i nailed him pretty good .
i warned you .
okay , reuben .
where are your cool friends now ?
not q @-@ tipping your ear , that &apos;s for sure .
okay , reuben .
this is why i never hang out with cool kids .
yeah , you rejected them ,
shortly after you and your mom
roller danced at the talent show .
oh ... we were robbed .
couldn &apos;t have been the song you picked .
&quot; wind beneath my w-- &quot; ow !
