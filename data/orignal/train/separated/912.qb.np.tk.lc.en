back in the &apos; 80s ,
everyone had their favorite guitar @-@ shredding rock god .
but there &apos;s only one musical bad boy
who rocked my world --
weird al .
dare to be stupid ?
you know it !
weird al made me want to write comedy .
the way he &apos;d parody a pop song never ceased to amaze me .
is that my cher wig from halloween ?
darn right .
can i borrow some hair spray ? i think i need more body .
you are so weird .
weird al even inspired me to write my own parody songs .
good news , bro .
i &apos;ve decided to honor you in song .
it &apos;s about time !
you know the wang chung song &quot; everybody have fun tonight &quot; ?
well , i changed all the lyrics to make them all about you .
ahh , you &apos;ve improved the song . let &apos;s hear it .
* everybody have fun tonight *
* my brother barry is a wang tonight *
* barry &apos;s gonna kick your ass tonight *
yep , weird al was my comic muse ,
and i finally had the chance to see him live .
mom , i have the single @-@ greatest news on the planet .
you have that terrible disease that makes you stop growing ,
and you &apos;re gonna stay my little schmoopie forever .
no . weird al is playing at the mann music center .
and you want to take your mama as your date .
stop hearing what you want and listen .
he has two shows this week ,
and dana &apos;s in town visiting her grandma .
i &apos;ll surprise her with tickets !
while i find his hawaiian shirts festive .
you &apos;re much too young
to go to a family @-@ friendly comedy show unsupervised .
please , you have to say yes . dana &apos;s the love of my life .
i mean , after you .
the best mama in the world .
i &apos;ll let you sniff the top of my head for two seconds .

done .
it was february 12 , 1980 @-@ something --
the day my brother actually got involved in school .
what &apos;s that ?
just a lame old sign @-@ up sheet
for kids that want to become peer counselors .
it &apos;s a boring old club for nerds .
you &apos;re not a nerd , are you ?
&apos;cause this here -- this is nerd city .
sign me up .
what ? no .
you &apos;re underselling it ,
which means it &apos;s awesome , and i want in .
look , mr. goldberg , i have dreamt of starting
a peer @-@ counseling program at this school for years .
i need emotionally mature students
who are a healing presence in school .
well , you just got yourself
an officially licensed school therapist .
no ! wow . do not tell people that .
it &apos;s too late . i signed the sheet ,
which means i can advise anyone on anything ,
and they have to listen to me .
that &apos;s not what it means .
fellas , i &apos;ve recently become a fully licensed and bonded
medical psychiatrist , so if any of you want
to work through your personal issues , this is your safe space .
i really miss my grandpa .
you &apos;re short , be taller . boom . next !
there &apos;s this girl i like ,
but she won &apos;t give me the time of day .
well , that &apos;s &apos; cause you suck at nunchucks , bro .
the fastest way to a girl &apos;s heart is some sweet &apos; chuckin &apos; .
boom . next !
i feel like my father doesn &apos;t respect me .
so be less boring .
boom ! next !
no , stop !
no one listen to a word this douche @-@ monger just said .
naked rob , just open up to your dad a bit .
nothing earns respect more
than being honest with how you feel .
and , andy , it &apos;s perfectly normal to miss your grandpa ,
no matter what size you are .
and , you , this girl , who &apos;s clearly me ,
just wants to be friends .
my heart hurts , but i appreciate the open communication ,
and it only makes me like you more .
well , well .
god gives you one goldberg and counters it with another .
you &apos;re right . she &apos;s the worst .
jtp out .
erica , look , i &apos;m not gonna beat around the bush about this .
i need you to become a peer counselor .
you &apos;re smart , you &apos;re popular , and only you can undo
the terrible damage that your brother
is going to wreak upon this school .
i appreciate the offer , but --
i &apos;ll give you an &quot; a &quot; in any class you want .
what ? you can do that ?
open up a file cabinet and make a mark with my pen ?
yeah , i can do that .
seems wrong to give me an &quot; a &quot; in gym
when i &apos;ve been cutting all year .
that said , i won &apos;t notice
&apos;cause i &apos;ll be too busy counseling peers and stuff .
deal .
here &apos;s your informational binder
and your therapy puppet .
this is usually for smaller kids ,
but the burners like it , too .
as erica was getting ready to connect with others ,
i was about to reconnect with the love of my life .
hi , mrs. goldberg .
dana .
i brought you some coffee beans from seattle .
that is so thoughtful for someone who drinks coffee .
i don &apos;t . i &apos;m a tea drinker .
you &apos;ve known me for two years ,
but thanks for the partial gift , dana .
that &apos;s very sweet .
adam , dana brought me a bag of beans !
dana eleanor caldwell , are you ready for the greatest ,
most @-@ romantic weekend of your life ?
in this box , i &apos;ve prepared our greatest hits ,
and we &apos;re gonna tackle each one .
laser tag , &quot; alf &quot; marathon ,
&quot; super mario bros. , &quot;
pogo ball .
you in ?
um , sure , it &apos;s been a while .
come on ! pogo balling is just like riding a bike .
oh ! we should also ride bikes .
classic us .
but to our surprise ,
our greatest hits suddenly felt like misses .
pogoing on a ball is fun .
well , it &apos;s kind of hard in these jellies .
but they &apos;re cute , right ?
yeah , they &apos;re shoes .
we were off to a slow start ,
but a romantic beefaroni dinner would
change that .
is it me , or did your tree house get smaller ?
no . same size .
guess it &apos;s us who got bigger .
you want an ecto cooler ?
chef boyardee himself recommends it with the beef .
yeah , i &apos;m just gonna grab a perrier .
balls !
maybe i should spend a little time with my grandma .
no , wait !
i actually have a big surprise for you .
you and me are going to our first rock concert together !
no way ! who is it ?
only the greatest artist of our time .
madonna ?
better !
the police ?
better !
michael jackson ? !
well , he &apos;s worked with all three ,
but in a way , he &apos;s improved their work
by making it super funny !
&quot; weird al &quot; yankovic !
the guy who sings about food .
sure , some songs are about food ,
like &quot; eat it , &quot; &quot; lasagna , &quot;
&quot; i love rocky road , &quot; and &quot; my bologna . &quot;
but he also sings about love and life and hernias !
i didn &apos;t realize you were still into him .
and the best part --
i got us al shirts to wear to the concert .
ladies &apos; choice .
but if i were a lady ,
i &apos;d want to see my man in a jungle tiger pattern .
as i was planning our big date ,
erica helped naked rob make a big breakthrough .
i can &apos;t thank you enough for all the help with my dad .
i really think we turned a corner .
that &apos;s my job , naked robert . i &apos;m here for you .
so great to have someone i can trust and --
how dare you !
what ? !
healing my nutjob friends behind my back ?
you &apos;re not legally authorized for that .
only i am !
not anymore , pal .
mr. glascott asked me , and you know what ?
it feels awesome to actually help people .
unlike you , who just leaves behind a wake of broken souls .
all you did was charm naked rob with your feminine wiles .
if it was anyone else , i &apos;d totally out @-@ counsel you .
it &apos;s adorable you think that .
then i challenge you to a counsel @-@ off .
name anyone .
first one to fix that person &apos;s brain
is crowned champion advicer .
first of all , not a word ,
and second , when you lose , you quit .
same goes for you , sucker .
go ahead . pick anybody .
the more depressed , the better .
do you even know what the signs of depression actually are ?
of course !
i just need you to say them so you can understand them better .
fine . number one -- fatigue .
will you two stop yapping ? i &apos;m exhausted from a hard day .
number two -- lethargy .
oh , so far .
number three -- irritability .
i told you two morons -- put the remote in the side pocket !
four -- persistent aches and pains .
oh , now i hurt my back from stretching !
five -- mood swings .
eh , &quot; love boat &apos;s &quot; on !
and finally , sudden exhaustion .
dad !
all right , first one to fix
that man &apos;s crippling depression wins .
this is gonna be really hard .
as erica and barry were playing therapist ,
dana and i were playing &quot; mario bros. , &quot;
but even though we were on the same side ,
we felt miles apart .
hey , snuggle bunny ... and also dana .
gear up , we &apos;re gonna leave in five minutes .
even though we all agree
adam should be taking me to his first comedy concert .
the good news is adam will be all yours soon enough .
what do you mean ?
look at how they &apos;re playing &quot; super immigrant plumbers . &quot;
their thumbs are in it , but their hearts aren &apos;t .
no way . adam and dana are as solid as ever .
did you see them pogo ball ?
that &apos;s a sport for lovers ,
and they were just going through the motions .
oh , my god . no !
adam and dana are so wonderful together !
since when do you like dana ?
i adore the girl .
got to say , i &apos;m surprised ,
given all the passive @-@ aggressive interactions ,
not to mention the aggressive @-@ aggressive ones .
but deep down , i think she &apos;s sweet and kind and beautiful ,
and it helps that she lives 3,000 miles away
and i get adam 98 % of the time !
that &apos;s the whole problem right there , bevy .
they &apos;ve been apart too long .
let &apos;s hope that weird al is just what they need
to bring them back together .
what ?
ladies and gentlemen , weird al !
oh , my god . this is amazing !
we got to get a photo of the two of us .
yeah , that &apos;d be nice !
make sure you get weird al &apos;s whole body in it .
barry and erica &apos;s counsel @-@ off was on .
it was a mano @-@ a @-@ mano battle of who could fix dad first .
hey , big guy .
how you feeling today ? you look sad .
are you sad ? can i help ?
i &apos;m not giving you money .
i &apos;m not here for money .
i &apos;m here for you .
you &apos;re afraid to open up to me .
feels like we can tackle this with some word association .
you ready ?
no .
abandonment .
stop .
family .
go .
love .
leave !
you seem angry , bro .
know what cures me when i &apos;m angry ?
screaming into something .
here . try my rage pillow .
it &apos;ll make you feel better .
what ? you &apos;re supposed to yell in it , not throw it at me !
what &apos;s the matter with you ? that &apos;s my favorite pillow !
i do feel better .
hey , mur @-@ man .
it &apos;s safe to tell me your dark secrets .
what &apos;s with the puppet ? what &apos;s going on ?
get out of here !
you &apos;re getting sleepy . when you wake up --
what the hell &apos;s wrong with you two ?
forget what that dope &apos;s doing .
all i &apos;m looking for is a smile on your face .
let me see that smile .
yeah , smile for barry .
no .
shut up .
smile for erica !
fine .
if i smile , will you both leave ?
that &apos;s your smile ?
god , what is that ?
why ?
yeah , this is what you wanted .
it &apos;s so wrong and disturbing !
look at it !
stop it !
look at the joy on my face !
are you my dad ?
now get over here and hug me !
this was a terrible mistake ! i &apos;m so sorry !
no , wait ! don &apos;t leave me alone with that face !
oh , my god !
that &apos;s right ! run !
okay , that didn &apos;t count .
just pick someone else we can counselor @-@ ate .
forget the competition !
don &apos;t you realize we have a dad who can &apos;t even smile ?
that &apos;s like an actual problem .
i see what you &apos;re saying .
you forfeit ! barry wins . the puppet &apos;s mine .
forget the puppet !
i want the puppet !
take the stupid puppet .
i &apos;ll just help dad myself .
damn it . you &apos;ve made this a hollow victory .
and now i &apos;m worried . wait up .
as barry and erica were on a mission to help my dad ,
i was on a mission to meet my hero .
look ! there he is !
his glasses are so much bigger in real life .
people , please , please , please , settle down .
no , we &apos;re too far back .
come on . let &apos;s elbow our way to the front .
can we maybe just do something more fun instead ?
how can you say that ?
wasn &apos;t it fun when we slow @-@ danced
to &quot; i think i &apos;m a clone now &quot; ?
only &apos; cause i like the tiffany song .
i closed my eyes and imagined the original lyrics .
you faked it ?
i just don &apos;t like weird al like i used to , okay ?
ouch !
not gonna lie , random child .
that stings .
oh , god . i &apos;m sorry , mr. weird .
mr. al . she didn &apos;t mean it .
sounded like she did , bro .
please don &apos;t judge me by her words .
i don &apos;t even know her .
adam !
how do you know my name , strange lady ?
seriously ? you &apos;re picking him over me ?
i don &apos;t know what to do !
i &apos;ve never been asked to choose between
two people i love equally .
i &apos;m so out of here .
fine ! go !
i &apos;ll just be here cold chillin &apos; with my new best buddy , al .
ooh . i really wouldn &apos;t make me part of your plan .
look . i didn &apos;t even want to be here .
i just wanted to hang out ,
not ride bikes or play laser tag or pogo ball .
what are you saying ?
i just don &apos;t think we get each other anymore .
ooh ! she looks super mad !
kind of like that time i asked prince
if i could turn &quot; when doves cry &quot; into &quot; when spuds fry . &quot;
you know , spuds are potatoes .
no , i @-@ it &apos;s genius .
it &apos;s just ... things are so bad with dana .
you know , sounds to me like
you and agnes just drifted apart .
doesn &apos;t mean you don &apos;t love each other , todd .
you just grew up .
as dana was slipping away , erica and barry were trying
to get a grip on my dad &apos;s depression .
you kids made the right choice coming to old glascott .
let &apos;s do this .
well , technically , we came to you for a recommendation .
and i recommended myself .
i come highly recommended .
look , if anyone knows the ins and outs of depression ,
it &apos;s me .
i &apos;m proud to say that i &apos;ve slayed that dragon many a time .
dad &apos;s coming down the hall . get in position .
mr. goldberg .
got your call .
what &apos;d these morons do that i had to leave work early ?
please , have a seat , mr. goldberg .
we need to have a very serious discussion about you .
me ?
your kids are concerned
that you might have a real case of the blues .
luckily , i &apos;m here to help , and so is carl .
he &apos;s a real sad sack , too . why don &apos;t you two talk ?
hey , mr. goldberg .
what &apos;s up , buddy ?
what &apos;s with everybody and puppets ? !
you can talk to me .
is that what this is all about ?
you &apos;re worried about me ?
you &apos;re very moody and sleepy and angry .
and you sit a lot .
i &apos;m not depressed .
i &apos;m a dad !
let me get this straight .
you don &apos;t struggle getting out of bed every morning
because , what &apos;s the point ?
no .
you don &apos;t desperately fear being alone again at thanksgiving ?
no . you &apos;ve never faced the bottom of an ice @-@ cream pint
and thought , &quot; screw it . i &apos;m going again &quot; ?
no .
you don &apos;t write &quot; help me &quot;
in steam on the shower door ?
what ?
nothing .
okay , well , look .
i &apos;m glad that we could help you , mr. goldberg .
if you guys don &apos;t mind , i need to take a personal day .
hey , kiddo .
i know you &apos;re hurting ,
but you &apos;re never gonna be over one girl
until you &apos;re under the next .
whoa ! shut the up , dad .
what he means is don &apos;t give up on dana .
we can still fix this .
but al &apos;s my number @-@ one hero , and i believe anything he says .
what exactly did weird al say to you ?
all that matters is that he was right .
people change and love dies .
at that moment , all my mom wanted was to fix my broken heart .
and so she did the only logical thing .
weird al ! over here , weird al !
we need to talk ! it &apos;s about love !
who said that ?
excuse me . excuse me . excuse me .
who is this who speaks of love ?
beverly goldberg .
i &apos;m sure you remember my delicious boy , adam .
of course .
super @-@ tall mute dude with dreadlocks and a droopy eye ?
please tell him i said ...
no , look .
you made him think his relationship was over ,
and now you &apos;re gonna fix it .
it &apos;s not happening .
oh , it &apos;s happening .
you &apos;re gonna get on that tour bus ,
take it into the suburbs , and put on a private concert
for adam and dana with all their favorite songs .
such as ?
&quot; every rose has its thorn . &quot;
&quot; every toe has its corn &quot; ?
&quot; the wind beneath my wings . &quot;
&quot; the bed above my springs . &quot;
&quot; material girl . &quot;
&quot; bacterial earl &quot; !
&quot; heaven is a place on earth . &quot;
&quot; kevin is a dude with girth . &quot;
&quot; careless whisper . &quot;
&quot; your hairless sister . &quot;
&quot; fight the power . &quot;
&quot; smell the flounder &quot; ?
stop it .
listen .
a private concert isn &apos;t gonna bring those kids back together .
but do you know what can ?
a mother &apos;s love .
you think ?
yes .
only you can fix this .
their future is in your hands .
thank you , weird al .
thank you so much .
move it ! i need to fix my baby &apos;s relationship .
okay , why do i even pay for security ? !
she was clearly crazy , and you just stood there !
after some sage advice from weird al ,
my mom decided to put on a show of her own .
there he is ! come on in , smushie .
you know dana . have a seat .
oh , god . what have you done ?
what is this ? why are you here ?
all i &apos;m asking is for a minute of your time .
after that , you can both move on with your lives .
please .
now , what i &apos;m about to show you
was gonna be played at your wedding ,
so when the day comes , act surprised .
remember this ?
wow , i actually do .
i lost my kite , and you gave me yours .
i was so nervous talking to you .
that was the night of our first kiss .
yeah . best birthday ever .
wait . were you , like , lurking around the whole time ?
no .
then how did you -- - moving on .
dude , were you spying on us ?
what ? no .
i was cleaning the closet , and , you know --
shh ! just focus on your love .
what the ...
you took that hanging off the roof ?
a photographer does what she needs to do to get the shot .
the point is , it &apos;s always been adam and dana .
you can &apos;t just throw that away .
enough !
all those photos are in the past .
there &apos;s nothing to show now
&apos;cause dana lives in seattle and i &apos;m stuck here .
it just ... isn &apos;t the same .
he &apos;s right .
seeing those photos , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s not us anymore .
i just wish you two didn &apos;t leave it like this .
you deserve so much better .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
i just thought i could fix it .
i &apos;m kind of surprised .
i always thought you didn &apos;t like me .
oh , dana .
you &apos;ll always be the best first love my baby could have .
besides me , of course .
in that moment , dana realized my mom was right .
we couldn &apos;t leave it like this .
what are you doing ?
this is how you won me over two years ago .
so this is how i want to say goodbye .
you &apos;re playing weird al .
i thought you don &apos;t like him anymore .
i may have outgrown him ,
but it doesn &apos;t mean i still don &apos;t like him .
i just thought we &apos;d be together forever , you know ?
and maybe we will .
but for now , i think we &apos;re supposed to be apart .
that still doesn &apos;t change the fact
that you will always be my first crush .
my first kiss .
my first love .
you keep it . to remember me .
i will always remember you , adam .
truth is , it wasn &apos;t how i saw things ending ...
... with the girl from down the street ,
but part of growing up
is learning when it &apos;s time to move on .
hey , can we talk ?
no .
not about feelings .
we just want to apologize .
yeah , we didn &apos;t realize you being so lazy and angry
.. is actually you crazy happy .
i &apos;m a simple guy . i sit in my chair . i watch tv .
i yell at you two morons .
and honestly , that &apos;s my happy place .
well , it &apos;s good to know we don &apos;t have to worry about you .
hey , that means you care .
you know , now would be a perfect time for you to actually smile .
pass .
worth a try .
in the end , erica and barry did make my dad smile ,
and they also discovered there was someone else in the house
who could use their help .
hey , what &apos;s wrong ?
just packing up my greatest hits with dana .
it &apos;s over .
oh , god . i @-@ i &apos;m so sorry .
you want to talk about it ?
no .
come on . let &apos;s go to wawa . tastykakes on me ?
that &apos;s the thing about growing up --
you try to hold on to things until you realize ...
... maybe change is a good thing , and if you &apos;re lucky ,
your family is there to guide you through it all .
roll it !
are you kidding me ? no , i won &apos;t sing it !
bar , our little brother needs our love and support right now .
a good parody song is gonna help .
that would make me feel better .
fine .
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 .
* everybody have fun tonight *
* my brother barry is a wang tonight *
* brother barry &apos;s so dumb tonight *
* can &apos;t even tell his left from right *
barry , take it !
* my brother barry is a stupid jerk *
i can &apos;t ! i can &apos;t do this !
where &apos;s my rage pillow ? !
you know , this song &apos;s actually kind of funny .
i know ! and that &apos;s exactly why i sent weird al a demo .
* my brother barry is a wang toni-- *
who &apos;s this barry ?
this song offers no context !
total amateurs !
