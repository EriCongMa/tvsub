friends , ex @-@ girlfriend , winston ,
months ago i warned you that winter was coming .
and for the cold and wretched days ahead ,
i stressed our need to take lovers
and take them quickly .
your head is huge .
your hat &apos;s the size of a garbage can .
you look great in that hat , man . what a hunk .
you look like jewish pharrell .
th @-@ thank you very much . i appreciate it . okay .
now , winter is now here .
and i vow that we will not miss
our final opportunity for sexual realization in 2014 .
did you steal my belt buckle , you silly billy ?
enough out of you , winston !
silly billy ? dude .
if you unzipped your face and an old white woman popped out ,
i would not be shocked .
really ?
no .
i would .
i would be very surprised .
that is why this year we will not be celebrating thanksgiving .
instead , we will be celebrating ...
remember last thanksgiving when i almost died ?
... bangsgiving ! we &apos;ll be celebrating bangsgiving !
why can &apos;t you let me just have this , you guys ? please .
okay . you &apos;ve been talking about this for , like , a week , schmidt .
we get it . let &apos;s just pick names already .
i can &apos;t believe that you are into bangsgiving .
i just want to meet a guy so i can forget about ryan .
just date him , jess .
&apos;cause i &apos;m his boss ,
and it &apos;s against the rules for me to date him .
just date him . it &apos;s a dumb rule .
it &apos;s against the rules .
take the hat .
now , whosever name you pick , that &apos;s who
you &apos;ll be bringing a date for .
and no date leaves until everyone is laid .
i just want to meet a nice fella .
can i have permission to send them home
without sex ?
no , you do not .
i think everybody &apos;s date should be able to leave .
yeah , your plan sounds a little kidnappy .
what &apos;s the rule on that , winston ?
gray area . we &apos;re good .
winston is in . my man . and , okay , nobody say
who you picked . it &apos;ll ruin the surprise .
crap . you picked me .
no ! how &apos;d you know ?
and now you &apos;re gonna set me up with you , aren &apos;t you ?
cece , i @-@ i know that this holiday
is a bittersweet memory for your people ,
but , please , do not take that out on me .
wrong kind of indian .
okay , well , i picked you , too , so i want to re @-@ pick .
no re @-@ picking . and no more telling .
so , listen up , uh , for whoever picked me ,
i just want you to know
that i have really gotten into feet lately ,
so do with that what you will .
no one do anything with that .
can i just say no mustaches ?
i &apos;d like someone tall .
she &apos;s got to have an ass .
can i just reiterate the whole feet thing ?
i want to say who i picked so bad .
i &apos;m looking for a fake redhead . with a medium @-@ sized neck .
i just want to be slapped around .
so , pearl , i told winston that you work at my school .
and , um , winston is about to become a cop ,
which you &apos;ve probably already gathered from the fact
that he pinned his badge to his sport coat .
what ?
how did that get there ?
let me freshen your drink .
excuse me a second .
hey , coach . coach .
look at what jess brought me .
oh , pearl ? yeah , she &apos;s great , man .
hey , come here . you got something on your face .
really ? what is it ?
it &apos;s , like , right ...
what were you thinking , bringing me that girl
from the police academy ?
what &apos;s wrong with pepper ?
allow me ...
arms !
she &apos;s jacked , dude . you should &apos;ve warned me
you were setting me up with one of the guardians of the galaxy .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;s not that bad .
where was she when i was cracking walnuts
for the stuffing ?
look , she &apos;s fantastic . she &apos;s beautiful .
you &apos;re gonna love her .
now , if you jerks will excuse me ,
this bishop &apos;s got to capture himself a queen .
she &apos;s doing push @-@ ups .
for your lady .
thank you . thank you very much , jess .
pearl , she &apos;s ...
yeah , she &apos;s great .
what grade does she teach ?
oh , she doesn &apos;t teach . she &apos;s the lunch lady .
you said the lunch lady ?
yeah .
so where exactly is this &quot; date &quot; of mine ?
all right , i invited lucy , like you asked .
your date &apos;s name is geoff
and he will be here . by the way ,
he spells geoff with a &quot; g , &quot; so you know he comes from money .
well , i think the real difference is
crocodiles are man @-@ eaters and alligators ...
what in the bloody hell ?
uh , hey , nick . what is tran doing here ?
oh , well , i picked my own name .
so you said to bring somebody . so i thought it &apos;d be weird
if i didn &apos;t bring someone . so i just brought tran .
you brought an old asian man to my sex party
so it wouldn &apos;t be weird ?
relax . he didn &apos;t come empty @-@ handed .
he brought a game . it &apos;s like thailand monopoly .
yeah , all the squares are jail except for one piece of property
which we all have to fight each other for .
but don &apos;t get caught in the red light district .
this isn &apos;t a freaking game night , nick .
okay , chill out .
you ... you &apos;re making a mockery of this holiday and you know it .
i didn &apos;t mean to make fun of thailand ,
if that &apos;s where you &apos;re from even .
hey . lucy .
it &apos;s so good to see you .
how are you ?
oh , i &apos;m great .
lucy ? lucy &apos;s here with schmidt ?
where &apos;s my set @-@ up , already ? i &apos;m looking at the menu ,
and i see a lot of skirt but no steak .
i think that coach picked you , so watch out .
&apos;cause i &apos;m sure he &apos;s gonna bring one of his clients
or weird , like , gym buddies .
ryan .
what ?
ryan . ryan .
ryan @-@ ryan ?
he brought ryan . oh , god .
i don &apos;t think i can even look at him ,
like , without getting pregnant .
he just oozes sex .
good holiday to you ! i &apos;ve come with biscuits !
hey , hey , hey , schmidt , lucy ? i @-@ i used to date lucy .
oh , i know , bro .
i met her that day
you gave me the pass to your gym .
hey , do you have any snacks ? !
yeah , you blew her off . i didn &apos;t think it would be a problem .
oh , it &apos;s a problem . i &apos;m telling you it &apos;s a problem .
and i forbid you from dating her ,
so ... cut it off .
grounds ?
the statute of limitation hasn &apos;t expired .
you dated her three years ago
for , like , two and a half months .
the statute is very specific . 1,000 showers .
after that , no claim .
and if you think
i &apos;ve showered 1,000 times in the past three years ,
then you &apos;re out of your mind .
did you ever spend more than $ 65 on her , not including tip ?
it &apos;s tough . there were a lot of coupons involved .
did you ever watch her dog ?
trick question : she had fish and i killed them .
you ever get her a gift ?
every time we had sex .
no claim .
no claim ?
hi , nick . it &apos;s been a long time .
lucille . great to see you .
do you still like to eat , uh ... popcorn ?
i guess so .
oh , you see that ? i know her foods .
you must have spoiled her , huh ?
you know , if you &apos;ll excuse us , i &apos;m gonna give lucy the tour .
come on , lucy .
i &apos;m calling my penis &quot; the tour . &quot;
my tour &apos;s more satisfying .
his is all about him . mine &apos;s about you sometimes .
hi .
hi ! uh , thanks for inviting me tonight .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t realize this was a singles party .
oh . no . uh , s @-@ sorry .
did coach say that with a sean connery accent ?
did he say &quot; shingles &quot; ? &apos; cause he was ...
he actually meant shingles . like the ... like ...
everybody here is a @-@ a roofer .
look , the last time i saw you , i kissed you .
i know that . we both know that .
mm . but this can &apos;t happen .
are we attracted to each other ?
yes . do i sing oasis songs to myself
and pretend that they were inspired by your love for me ? i do .
but my job is to enforce the rules .
and i love my job . and i worked hard to get it .
so this cannot happen .
is that why you &apos;ve locked me in your bedroom
and undone the top button on your dress ?
i didn &apos;t undo the t ...
well , i did .
but that was an accident . that wasn &apos;t for you .
it was for me .
i just need to know that you will respect the rules
and that this will go no further .
i &apos;ll do my best .
looks like you missed a few .
what ?
okay . i summoned everyone to the roof
because bangsgiving is in peril .
all of you are focusing on things
that have nothing to do with getting laid .
let us please not repeat the mistakes that we made
at my eight nights of hump @-@ akah party .
now , what is the freakin &apos; problem ?
coach did the opposite of what i asked .
come on , jess , you guys would be great together .
it &apos;s a dumb rule , all right ?
dumb rule .
at least he turns you on .
pepper makes my ding @-@ dong and my ping @-@ pongs go into my body .
can somebody help me with this keg ?
yeah , sure .
pepper &apos;s got it .
what if she doesn &apos;t know her own strength down there ,
and she mushes it , or , like ,
be a nightmare .
rips it off and throws it across the room like a hot dog ?
that &apos;s nothing . jess brought me a hot lunch lady .
what am i supposed to do with that ?
do sex with the lunch lady .
that &apos;s obvious . i have a real ...
wait .
i know how it sounds . i know how it sounds ,
but she &apos;s a ... like , a real lunch lady .
that &apos;s hot .
no .
a woman that &apos;s willing , ready and able ...
that &apos;s not an issue .
after she has sex with you , she can put food in your mouth .
that &apos;s not a problem at all . i do have a real problem .
schmidt is trying to sleep with a woman i &apos;ve already slept with .
well , at least he has a date , because mine never showed up .
geoff is coming ! apparently , a wild peacock got loose
on the freeway , and is holding up traffic .
now , you guys , we have guests downstairs .
and if we don &apos;t get back to them soon , they &apos;re gonna get spooked .
um , so , have you always been from england ?
i &apos;m not going downstairs
until schmidt agrees to not sleep with lucy .
okay , yeah , sure . never !
according to the statute ,
if you two can &apos;t agree , we take it to a vote .
the winner gets the girl , the loser
gets five grilled cheese sandwiches .
i &apos;ll agree to that .
let &apos;s do it .
all right , all those in favor
of schmidt not sleeping with lucy , raise your hand now .
i don &apos;t care .
couldn &apos;t care less .
raise &apos; em up .
put &apos; em up .
huzzah ! warning : tonight things will get loud with lucy .
but don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll have her jam a sock in my mouth
right before i see angels .
okay , guys , what about me ?
get your own sock .
no . what am i gonna do about ryan ?
just have sex with him .
look , bang one out , get it out of your system .
i don &apos;t do that .
you should do that .
you should bang one out .
yeah , makes the most sense .
what ? !
nothing else has worked , okay , and the best way
to get over a crush is just to do something about it .
i don &apos;t know .
plus , he &apos;s british ,
so you know the sex will be weirdly polite .
do you mind if i finish now ?
he doesn &apos;t sound like oliver twist .
do you like that ? is that good , eh ?
all right . here we go .
one-- really ? two-- what ?
do you mind if i do it like that ?
hey , you like it when i do it like that , eh ?
that was spot @-@ on .
all those in favor
of jess doing ryan , raise your hand .
oh , he &apos;s trying to mess with me ?
here i go .
cecilia .
no , you cannot have my beer .
you think i &apos;m going after the beer .
you okay ?
okay , great .
杰茜卡 · 戴
happy bangsgiving .
close the door .
oh , my god .
is there nothing underneath that apron ?
just a little white meat looking for some gravy .
that probably wasn &apos;t very sexy . i shouldn &apos;t have said that !
no , it was very becoming .
i &apos;m totally confused about these oven mitts .
how else am i supposed to take a hot dish out of the oven ?
these mitts were a bad idea .
what , uh , got you in the @-@ the , uh , holiday , uh , sp @-@ spirit ?
well , i like you , you like me .
why don &apos;t we just ... bang one out of our system ?
bang one out of our system ?
it sounds really bad . i get that .
and i hear it now , it sounds awful .
but we just bang one out of our system , and then ,
we can go back to our strictly professional relationship ,
and i can stop thinking about you all the time , which i do .
i didn &apos;t come here to bang one out .
well , you know what i mean .
look ...
i care about you .
well ...
jess , i &apos;m crazy about you .
ryan , look . oh , god , it &apos;s so complicated .
can i just put some pants on when we talk about this ?
it is complicated .
this would have been worth it .
oh , god . ryan . ryan !
oh , god !
oh , no !
freaking bangsgiving .
no , i actually put those in there myself .
i &apos;ll tell you , i wouldn &apos;t eat asparagus though .
it makes your pee smell .
hey , cece , i got that $ 20 i owe you .
it &apos;s , uh ... it &apos;s in my bedroom .
okay .
yeah , it &apos;s right this way .
you &apos;re really sexy for a jew .
not now , woman !
wait . what ?
who needs men ? you don &apos;t need a man .
you can lift your own furniture .
hey , pepper .
oh , god .
oh , my god , are you okay ?
i am so sorry . you approached my blind spot .
your money &apos;s in here somewhere .
let me just find it , okay ?
oh , great .
what &apos;s wrong ? you hurt yourself ?
no . it &apos;s just not there . uh , let me .
ooh . ooh , that feels so good !
when i &apos;m looking for your money , it feels so good .
oh ! i love that !
you &apos;re a nasty woman !
&apos;cause you &apos;re making me give the money to you .
nick ...
oh , cece , you love this ! getting your money .
what exactly are you doing right now ?
i &apos;m getting your money .
you &apos;re definitely not getting my money .
in no world do you have my money .
i was flirting with you
to give schmidt a taste of his own medicine .
okay ? and it &apos;s a huge mistake ,
and insulting to everyone involved , and i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , and also , he would never
fall for that at all , okay ?
you &apos;re a dead man , miller !
don &apos;t . don &apos;t .
i &apos;ll choke you to death .
i &apos;ll choke you to death .
barely fighting .
schmidt , nothing was going on !
he was just trying to make you jealous .
please . i know that !
he would never hit on you . you &apos;re on my never list .
i know she &apos;s on your never ... whoa ! whoa ! what are you doing ?
you &apos;re pissed at me for bringing lucy ,
and you bring tran as a date ?
hey , leave tran out of this . he fought in korea !
i don &apos;t know which side , but i know he &apos;s a war hero .
you couldn &apos;t find one of those drunk girls at the bar ?
the ones with no family or friends ?
that &apos;s your sweet spot , man .
i know i could have . i didn &apos;t want to .
why not ?
what kind of woman have you been sleeping with
since you and jess broke up ?
terrible ones .
and how does that made you feel ?
terrible .
then really good .
expected . expected .
there you go .
but then , immediately after , terrible .
i &apos;m just gonna put this out there , but i think
you &apos;d probably rather like to sleep with someone
who doesn &apos;t make you feel terrible ,
but you &apos;re just a little afraid of getting hurt again .
no , that doesn &apos;t sound right .
you know , growing up ,
we had this lunch lady named ms. witten .
one day , i cut in line so i can get extra tater tots ,
and as punishment , she made me eat the entire tray
in front of her ...
while she stared at me for a long period of time .
i &apos;m not sure if you know how hard that is for a growing boy .
how old were you ?
i was 18 .
if it helps , we &apos;re called lunch monitors now .
no one says &quot; lunch lady &quot; anymore .
oh . kind of like how we can &apos;t call little people &quot; shrinkies . &quot;
oh . lunch monitor pearl . i like it .
excellent form .
you don &apos;t have a hard job .
so , i saw your butt earlier .
it &apos;s been holding up nicely .
it does the trick . yeah .
and i noticed , uh , ryan left .
yeah . ugh ! it &apos;s so embarrassing .
i kind of came onto him ,
and he told me he wanted more than just sex .
he wanted more than sex and that &apos;s a bad thing ? how ?
well , look , i &apos;m his boss .
we could get sued , and i could get fired .
there &apos;s a reason it &apos;s against the rules .
you gotta br ... okay .
remember when we tried to watch ferris bueller &apos;s day off ?
okay , i stick by that-- that kid is not a hero .
all he does is break rules . what &apos;s so great about that ?
you &apos;re taking rooney &apos;s side . no one takes rooney &apos;s side .
i &apos;m a vice principal-- rooney is my people .
ferris hijacks a parade .
that is an act of terror .
you want to know what i think ,
&quot; cause you &apos;re not going to like it .
what ?
i don &apos;t think this is about breaking rules .
i think ryan scares you .
you like him , and you &apos;re going to have to put yourself
out there again , and that scares you .
but look ,
life moves really fast .
and if you don &apos;t stop and look around once in a while ,
you just might miss it .
is that from ferris bueller ?
yes , it is .
okay .
it &apos;s a terrific movie .
all right .
and i delivered it perfectly .
it was pretty good .
what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re fired .
just kidding .
oh , god .
you left without eating so i thought , um ...
i &apos;d bring you a pie . well , most of a pie .
the guys ate some of it . that &apos;s a lie .
i ate @-@ i ate @-@ i ate a piece on the way over .
i @-@ i ate two pieces .
three pieces .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
would you like to come inside ?
no , um , i came here to say something
and that this ...
i want more , too .
this dish is empty .
okay . i ate the whole pie .
look , i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing
or where this is going
and i &apos;m scared , but ...
it &apos;s worth it &apos; cause it feels big .
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to leave right now ,
and we &apos;re going to take it slow .
well , tonight is bangsgiving ,
and i have to honor my american traditions.ß
it &apos;s my duty as an american ...
i think i &apos;m going to stop being afraid and start dating .
you probably knew all along , didn &apos;t you ?
if only i could meet a girl like you , tran .
your face , your brain-- throw it in a dress .
oh , daddy , i &apos;d be with her forever .
i &apos;m getting off topic .
thanks for the talk . i feel a lot better .
tran , are these all yours ?
come on , man .
i thought you were switching to white wine .
how do you think you &apos;re going to get home now ?
you &apos;re not driving , so how are you going to get home ?
are you nick ?
you the guy who &apos;s obsessed with my grandfather ?
grandpaps , you ready to go ?
i &apos;m taking off . um ...
sorry i body @-@ slammed you
but this doesn &apos;t feel like it &apos;s working out
so i don &apos;t really want to waste our time .
look , pepper , um ...
i think you &apos;re beautiful ,
and very nice .
i just , uh ...
you know , i &apos;m not used to ...
dating women that are stronger than me .
how do you know that i &apos;m stronger than you ?
do you want to arm wrestle ?
yeah , like i &apos;m that insecure that i have to prove
my masculinity by arm wrestling a girl .
come on .
ready ?
yeah .
one , two , three .
yes ! that &apos;s how you do it !
that &apos;s how it &apos;s uh @-@ uh @-@ uh done !
thank you for letting me win .
sure . anytime .
well , lucy left .
turns out she &apos;s a bit of an anti @-@ semite .
hmm . yeah , looks like we both struck out .
okay , schmidt , there is no geoff .
come on . but to honest , i &apos;m kind of glad there isn &apos;t .
you know , thanksgiving should be spent
with the people that you care about .
let me get you a beer .
by the way ...
you &apos;re on my never list , too .
are you cece ?
i &apos;m geoff .
um , i &apos;m schmidt &apos;s friend .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late .
i hit a peacock on my way here
and then i held it in my arms until it died .
it was horrible , but also kind of uplifting .
um , anyway , i brought creamed spinach .
yeah !
there &apos;s my number .
tran ! hey , would you hit that . maybe ...
yeah .
ed rooney .
hi . this is george peterson .
how are you today , sir ?
it &apos;s not him , rooney .
this movie should be called the day rooney tried to do his job .
