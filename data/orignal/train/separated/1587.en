We can't do this.
But I'm not getting adopted.
I have to think about this. I have to...
Is it because of Lou? Is Lou why you can't be with me?
No, you're the reason why I can't be with you, Callie.
I'm done. We're done.
Let's start our own dance team.
Hey, Kaitlyn. I quit.
I really like you. What do I have to do to prove it to you?
What is with that towel?
Oh, my God!
Ana and I, we're working the program together.
I pray I can do better for this baby
than I did for my twins.
This is my worst nightmare.
Dirt in your food. Bugs in your tent.
You're sweating the whole time.
And then it gets dark, and you're like,
"Oh, where are the lights?"
But guess what, there are no lights. Why?
Because you're camping.
I've never been.
I had fun on my seventh-grade trip. Mostly.
And, to make matters worse,
I should be here this weekend... auditioning dancers.
Why are we whispering?
Hayley's here.
Saying "Goodbye" to Jesus.
Wait. What's wrong?
I'm mad at you.
It's just one weekend.
The one weekend my mom's out of town.
I had big plans. Naked plans.
What am I supposed to do?
You could say you're sick.
My moms would never let me stay home alone.
I'm staying home alone.
Seriously, your moms are so...
Hey, Mrs. Adams Foster!
Hey, Hayley.
Want to explain to me why your door is closed?
I don't know. It must have been blown shut.
Mm. Must have been all the hot air in here.
I should... I should go.
So soon?
I'll lead you out.
OK.
OK, troops, we're leaving in ten minutes!
Let's go! Chop-chop-chop!
Hey. So, I was thinking,
what if we make the kids leave their phones at home?
Do you want a mutiny?
No, I want them to actually experience
something without tweeting or twerking about it.
Twerking? Do you know what twerking is?
Yeah, some kind of social media thing.
This is twerking.
Really? I like that. Do that more often.
Honey, I know you want
this weekend to be a big bonding experience,
but the kids are addicted to their phones.
Fine. Great.
Then we'll take the TV with us and video games. It'll be awesome.
Or we can just let them wean themselves off.
And once we get out into nature,
with hopefully very bad reception,
I bet you they'll put them down.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I will take that bet. And when they don't,
I don't want it to fall on me to crack the whip.
You can't be "Nice mom" all the time.
I'm not "Nice mom."
Yes, you are.
Why do you think they always confide in you?
They don't. They... They come to you.
Yeah, when they want a push.
When they want a hug, they choose you.
I'm not mad about it, that's just the way it is.
Sorry.
No problem.
Uh, we... we were just saying goodbye.
Yeah.
Two whole days. How will I ever survive?
Uh, well, Stef asked me to put this stuff in Lena's car.
Oh, we're taking two cars now?
Yeah. Mariana has a lot of stuff, so...
Right. Shocker.
Uh, do you need help?
I'll just... No, I'm good.
OK. All right.
What?
You're bright red.
No, I'm not.
I'm just not a PDA guy.
Hm... You're hilarious.
I'm...
What?
Why don't we talk?
About what?
I don't know.
How's... how's wrestling going?
It's fine.
And... and Hayley? How are things with her?
She's whatever.
You never said what you thought of Alateen.
Did you find it helpful or...?
Ana's pregnant.
So you're approximately 17 weeks along?
Um, I think so. Uh, yeah.
Your amniotic fluid looks good.
The baby's... 11 centimeters.
That's about four and a half inches.
So small.
Everything looks perfect.
I'm just gonna take some pictures.
Would you like to know the sex?
Sure.
You're having a girl.
A girl.
Congratulations.
Wow. She has your eyes.
Actually, those are her feet.
Have you told anyone else?
No. Just you.
You should not have gone to that AA meeting without permission.
I know.
There are gonna have to be... some consequences.
Do you have to tell Mom?
Yes. Of course I'm gonna tell Mom.
And actually, I think it might be nice if you told her yourself.
I can't tell her.
You told me.
Yeah, because you don't get so mad.
That is not true. I just don't...
...show my madness as madly.
But I get mad. I am... I am mad!
Can't you...? Come...
No!
And when you do tell her,
just don't mention that you... that you told me.
Why?
Because...
It'll make her feel good.
That Ana's pregnant?
No. That you came to her first.
Oh, and she won't get so mad. I get it.
That's a good strategy.
What are you doing in there?
Oh. You're not gonna need that.
Why not?
We're glamping.
Um, won't we be cold, though?
I brought double-down comforters and a curling iron
and blow dryer that plug into the car. So we're set.
For what?
I... don't understand the question.
Don't you think we're a little far from the kids?
Not too far we can't keep an eye on them.
But just far enough that they don't have to hear us.
Oh. Hear us? Doing what?
I don't know, twerking?
Is that what you did? Having a fit. I don't...
Hey, we're out in the wilderness, right? Aren't we?
We get a little wild ourselves? Little...
Dog...
What are you guys doing?
Oh, nothing. Nothing. What's up?
Uh, can we go in the water?
You gotten the firewood?
Yep.
You have?
Yep.
All right, fine.
Just be careful where you walk with bare feet.
And remember, "Leaves of three, leave them be!"
Go! Get out of here!
Maybe we're not far enough.
Exactly.
Dude, get out!
Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't know you were...
What's that on your...?
It that real?
No, it's just a marker.
OK, yeah, it is real.
But Moms don't know, and if you tell anyone, I will kill you.
OK.
I mean it, don't go tattling.
I won't. But, um... how're you gonna go swimming?
You're gonna hang ten on the pond?
Mom, some of us don't want to get skin cancer, right?
Yeah, but there is something called sunscreen, you know.
Did you know that there are nanoparticles in many sunscreens
that show up in people's livers?
No, I didn't.
The best way to protect yourself
from the sun's damaging rays is to cover up.
OK, I stand corrected.
You're welcome.
Mom. Can I talk to you about something?
Uh, well...
Hey, uh, maybe just stay in the shallow end, OK?
Why? I know how to swim.
Not in a lake.
There could be a sudden drop-off.
And it's dark and you can't see the bottom. It's not like a pool.
I can't keep an eye on you every second, all right?
So just don't take any chances.
You comin' in, or what?
Uh, nah, I...
It's actually pretty cold.
Oh, come on!
Hey, I don't blame you.
I was watching this special on the Nature Channel.
Two words: Lake Monsters.
Ana's pregnant?
According to Jesus,
that's the announcement she made at the AA meeting.
Which he did not have permission to go to.
I hope you told him there'll be consequences.
Which I will be doling out.
What are we gonna tell Mariana?
I don't think we tell her anything.
Not until we know for sure.
Not gonna take it well.
Who do you think the father is?
Who knows?
You don't think it's... I mean...
...it's not Mike?
Right, he couldn't possibly be that stupid.
Hey, so, um...
Sorry about... walking in on, or out, on, uh,
on you and Lou earlier.
Oh, it's fine, don't worry about it. No big deal.
It wasn't weird for you?
No.
Was it weird for you?
No. Not at all.
I just don't want it to be weird for you.
Well, it's not.
Cool.
So, um...
It's gettin' chilly. I think I'm gonna go in.
Yeah, me too.
想我吗
当然
我在13号野营地 快溜出来找我
What are you looking for?
Um, nothing, thanks.
I'm looking for my phone.
I have to talk to Mike.
I have to find out if he's the father of Ana's baby...
Right this minute?
And what if he is, what're you gonna do about it?
I can't sit here and wait.
Sit here and wait?
Yes. Yes, you can. We are out here together,
as a family, to connect.
Off the grid, remember?
Does that look off the grid to you?
不清楚 在泳池边 你别走 我来找你
Dude, I need your help.
Hayley's here.
What, "Here" Here?
At another campsite. She just showed up.
Wow. That's a bold move.
What should I do?
Well, tell her to go home, I mean, before you get in trouble.
Really? I can say that?
Yeah.
I mean, you didn't invite her, right? Just text her back.
All right, everybody, hand over your phones.
What?
Mom!
Now! Let's go!
Let me finish.
No. Come on.
I'm gonna...
No, no!
Let me finish..
No more tweeting,
no more liking,
no more posting.
We are going off the grid.
Well, what are we supposed to do now?
And don't say "Enjoy nature."
What are we supposed to do now?
Nice follow-through.
Let's, uh... How about we go fishing?
Fishing. That sounds like fun.
Wait. Hold up. There's fish in that swamp?
Yeah, of course there are.
And you expect us to eat them?
Yes, you're going to eat them.
It's gonna be a Fosters family fishing expedition!
We're gonna catch and eat our food tonight!
Let's do it, huh? Come on, you guys, let's do it.
Everybody grab a pole! Got some bait!
It's gonna be awesome! Here we go!
Make sure everyone has a pole.
Here, here, take it.
Well, I, uh, I think you taught
us all a little something about patience today.
And we're all gonna try a bite of this, right, kids?
Thank God we brought burgers.
I thought you didn't eat meat.
Hey, we are out here in the
middle of nowhere, fighting for our lives.
I'm in survival mode.
Did you put bug spray on, Jude?
No.
Come on, you know mosquitoes love you.
'Cause you're so sweet.
Watch us get malaria.
Come here, I'll spray you down.
Arms out. Shut your eyes.
What if Hayley comes looking for me? Moms'll freak.
Relax. She's not gonna do that.
You don't know Hayley.
I'm surprised she already hasn't turned up.
I gotta get to her before she does. Cover for me.
What?
I've gotta go to the bathroom. I'll be right back.
Hey, you know the drill.
It's almost dark out. Two at a time, please.
I know where the bathroom is, Mom.
I don't know why we need that rule out here.
Because we're in the woods, Jesus. And we have to be careful.
Of what?
Well, of bears, for one thing.
Which reminds me, we gotta be careful about scraps out here. OK?
We can't leave anything out that might draw them over.
Um, I'm sorry. Did you just say bears?
Well, yeah, honey. This is bear country.
I think the campground website
said something about a sighting just last week.
So keep that in mind.
*She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes.*
*Yes, she will!*
*She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes.*
*Yes, she will!*
*She'll be comin' round the mountain,*
*she'll be* comin' round the mountain*
*She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes.*
*Yes, she will!*
She better not.
Now, the key...
...to architecting the perfect s'more is squishability.
If you can't squish it, don't dish it. Got it?
Got it.
*Hi, babe!*
*We'll all be shouting Hallelujah when she comes.*
*Hallelujah!*
*We'll all be shoutin' Hallelujah when she comes.*
Just don't get too close to the fire. I mean, do you want me...
I said I got it.
OK.
*We'll all be shoutin' Hallelujah when she comes.*
*Hallelujah!*
Good!
OK, Brandon, your turn.
Your turn!
Uh, OK. Any requests?
Play that song you wrote for Lou.
What song?
You know, the one you guys played at the party.
What party would this be?
Uh... Oh, just a friend's.
I think she means "Outlaws." You should play it.
I didn't write that for Lou.
It's what it looked like on stage. You guys were totally vibing.
OK, is that like twerking? Is that the same as twerking?
What?
So is something going on between you and Lou?
Yeah, they're totally dating, duh.
Well, isn't that interesting?
I wonder why you didn't mention that during your pitch
for going away on tour this summer.
Yes, I wonder.
That certainly adds another matter to consider.
You know, there's nothing
we can do on tour that we can't do at home.
But can we just talk about this later, maybe?
I think maybe we should talk about
putting cameras in the garage. What do you think?
I think you should stop talking and start playing.
More s'mores?
I'll have one. Hand me a skewer.
We should turn in.
We're gonna be up with the sun. Right?
It's early. It's really early.
Right?
Hey, I'm trying to get them to let me go on tour. OK?
So I can't be caught doing something stupid.
What if I get lost or get eaten by a bear or something?
I'm more worried about you getting eaten by Hayley.
You gotta cut that girl loose, man.
She's out there all alone, waiting for me.
Why don't you just tell Moms?
They already don't like her.
OK, well, I'm not sneaking out
with you so you can tell Hayley you can't sneak out.
Sorry, man, you're on your own.
Hey. What's going on?
Nothing. Don't worry about it.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Do you need me to go with you?
No.
We're supposed to go in twos.
Don't be such a Boy Scout.
Good night. Don't let the mosquitoes bite.
You know what? I think I'm gonna go
and check for trash one last time.
We already did that.
I know, I know. It's just to be safe.
Just to be safe. OK? I'll be back in two seconds.
Sorry, I was trying not to wake you.
It's fine. Ah. What time is it?
Oh, it's late.
I should get going.
Why don't you spend the night?
In fact, I've been thinking...
why don't you just move in?
Brandon, wake up.
Hey, Brandon.
What?
Jesus isn't back.
How long has he been gone?
Over an hour.
Is that a watch?
Yeah. People still wear them, you know.
Idiot.
Not you.
What if he's lost?
He's not lost.
What if he is?
All right, I'll go look for him.
Where did he go? And don't say the bathroom.
Hayley surprised him. She's at another campsite.
But you can't tell. OK?
OK.
Should I come with you?
No, no. Stay here. I'll be back.
Moms?
What's going on?
What's wrong, baby?
Well, he's not in the men's room.
Women's either.
They knew to go to the bathroom in pairs.
I'm starting to get worried.
Jude said they've been gone for hours.
They're just lost.
Someone's coming. Who's there?
Mrs. Adams Fosters? What are you doing here?
Hayley?
What are you doing here?
Why didn't you just come back?
She wasn't at her campsite. I had to go look for her.
She's probably lost.
Well, now so are we.
I think I remember seeing that star. Maybe we're that way.
Oh, thanks a lot, Magellan.
Who's Magellan?
Seriously? He navigated by the...
This explains a lot.
What was that?
How should I know?
Don't shine your light on it.
Why not?
What if it's a bear?
Oh, it's much worse than a bear.
Hayley? What are you doing here?
Is it morning already?
I'm sorry, honey.
I know this trip isn't turning out the way you planned.
Really? Whatever gave you that idea?
I didn't know she was coming.
I was gonna text her and tell her not to come,
but then somebody took away my phone.
So this is our fault?
Well...
I told him to tell you guys.
Thank you.
For what it's worth.
For what it's worth, why didn't you tell us?
'Cause I'm not a narc.
Like some people.
Hey. Jude did the right thing.
You guys could have been in danger out there.
And Brandon, the lack of judgment on your part
is not making a very strong case for going on tour.
So what are you guys gonna do about Hayley?
Until we get in touch with her mom,
not gonna let her go home alone.
So for now, we're stuck with her.
Good morning.
Sorry I ruined your family trip.
Hard to ruin something that already kinda sucked.
My mom went away with her new boyfriend this weekend,
and I just didn't wanna be home alone.
Your parents really got divorced?
Yeah.
I miss you on the team.
Really?
And Kaitlyn is like a bitch times a billion since you left.
She's so freaked out by your new team.
Yeah, our team of two.
You guys already have the best dancers at school.
Well, there's two we don't have.
What you guys did was pretty awesome.
Putting Kaitlyn in her place.
Nobody else had the guts to do it.
I should've walked, too.
Well, why don't you?
I, uh, heard about your little adventure last night.
So, um, is Lou hiding around here somewhere too?
Like, uh, in a tree or something?
Very funny.
How's the fire goin'?
You mean my punishment?
Moms put me in charge of breakfast.
But I can't get any of this stupid kindling to catch.
Here, won't this help?
Wait, no, don't... Jeez, Callie!
What?!
Of course you'd throw gasoline on a fire.
I'm sorry?
Jude.
Jude, what are you doing?
Going swimming.
OK, well, don't go out too far.
Jude?
Jude, look. I don't have a suit on.
Just wait a second and I'll go with you.
Jude, what are you doing?
I can swim, Callie!
I don't need you to watch me!
And I'm not afraid of the water because it's dark.
I'm not a baby!
I know that.
Then stop treating me like one! I'm 13!
And everyone keeps treating me like a kid, because you do.
You know what? Just get out of my way and leave me alone!
For your information, I didn't tell them about Hayley.
I told them that you were lost, which you were!
But next time, you can just get eaten by bears, for all I care.
Never seen Jude go off like that before.
Well, you know, we can be explosive like that.
I shouldn't have said that.
No, it's true.
I've caused a lot of drama, I guess, for you.
I've caused my share, you know, too.
I don't want it to be weird.
It's not weird.
It was weird.
On the porch, yesterday.
It would've been weird if it was Mariana.
Really? That weird?
What do you want me to say? I...
Just be honest, Brandon.
Ok.
It was hard for me when you were with Wyatt.
Being together.
You know, being affectionate.
Or not, when... I was around.
And I just don't want to rub it your face.
Did I rub Wyatt in your face?
No, but I...
I was in the position you're in right now.
And it didn't feel great.
Well...
What?
I don't know. I guess I should
thank you for not wanting to hurt me, but...
...you don't know what I'm feeling.
I'm not, like, pining after you. You have a girlfriend.
And I'm happy for you.
So you just do your thing, I'll do mine.
I don't... I don't want to feel like I'm holding you back.
Ok.
And you can talk to me about Lou.
What? You mean, like right now?
Well, it's not like there's much else to do out here,
you know, without our phones.
Talk.
OK, uh...
what do you want to know?
How's it going between you two?
It's fine. Good, I guess.
What do you like about her?
Uh... I don't know.
Really, you have no idea what you like about her?
She's smart, and talented.
And pretty.
Yes. Pretty.
Sexy?
Yes.
Good kisser? It looked like it yest...
OK, you're making it weird.
This is weird.
Was Wyatt a good kisser?
OK, OK. Yes.
I should probably talk to Jude.
Yeah, me too.
Or we... we could just take him swimming.
Robots are people too.
Free all robots.
See, it's cool, right?
We were thinking of, like, a dystopian future-type theme.
And I read somewhere that robots are, like, the new vampires.
So it's super current.
I read that too.
Tia is going to flip when she hears you switched teams.
It sucked having to pretend to be enemies.
I mean, you're not only my friend, but my boyfriend's sister.
And with everything you've been going through.
What all have I been going through?
Jesus told me about your birth mom being pregnant.
And that Brandon's dad might be the father.
And I just want you to know that I'm here for you.
You didn't tell me Ana's pregnant!
Mom told me not to!
What's going on?
Is Mike the father of Ana's baby?
Who told you that?
Hayley. I had to hear it from his girlfriend!
You told me you didn't tell anyone else.
So everyone knows?
Wait a minute. When did Jesus tell you this?
I...
When did you tell Mama?
She told me not to tell you I told her first.
Well, as long as Jesus is sharing everybody's secrets,
did he tell you the one about his tattoo?
What?!
Oh, my God. That is huge! When did you get that?
At the Mexican street festival.
You got this at a street festival?
Do you have any idea how lucky you are?
It could have gotten infected!
You could've gotten hepatitis...
They didn't card you?
The guy just took my money. That's it.
OK, who? Because this is a crime, Jesus. It's a crime. Who?
Mom, it's not like I got his card or anything.
You don't even know his name?!
Honey.
That's great. Please don't "honey" me.
And please stop making me feel like
I have to be the disciplinarian "dad" in this family.
That is awfully heteronormative thinking.
This is the time and place to have that conversation.
So are we done, or...?
No! We are not!
Why would you do this?!
'Cause I wanted to show Hayley how much I liked her.
Honey, that is what jewelry is for!
Where is Hayley, anyway? Hayley!
Mom, she's probably hiding. I should go look for her.
If I'm allowed.
Yes. You may go.
But we are far from done talking about this.
That's rich.
I discipline them just as much as you do.
Oh, yeah? How about asking one of them to lie?
Listen, I am sorry. I should not have done that.
OK.
I just didn't want you to feel bad
that he came to me first.
You didn't want me to be right.
You know why they come to you, Lena?
Because I'm the nice mom.
No, because you're easy mom.
Just because I don't fly off the handle?
You don't wanna be the bad guy.
I don't fly off the handle!
Why does anybody have to be the bad guy.
Someone has to lay down the law! That's why.
That's why they don't come to you.
Because you don't parent them,
you police them!
Oh, that's not fair!
I'm not saying all the time.
I am just saying that sometimes,
sometimes your anger can be intimid...
OK, maybe not...
Your intensity can be a little intimidating.
So they're scared of me?
They love you.
But I intimidate them?
You are a powerful, passionate woman.
You intimidate me sometimes.
Oh, please, come on.
It's true. And it's one of the things that I love about you.
How strong you are.
And maybe I am softer than I should be, at times.
I don't like conflict. You know that about me.
But if we want the kids to talk to us,
they have to feel heard.
You make them feel safe in so many ways,
so many ways I never could,
but they have to feel safe to talk to you too.
Well, somebody has to talk to Mariana.
And I'm sure that she wants you.
Don't do that. Don't play the martyr.
They want both of us.
Your parents must hate me.
They're not your biggest fans right now.
Thanks to Mariana.
I never should've come.
I should've never gotten your name tattooed on me.
I didn't even want to.
Well, I didn't make you.
I know. That's the problem.
I do things that I don't wanna do when I'm with you.
What are... What are you saying?
I'm saying I... I think we should break up.
Fine.
If that's what you want.
And you can tell your sister
and her stupid dance team to go to hell.
I bet you really love camping now. Huh?
Can we go home?
What, and leave paradise? Come on.
Don't cry. Honey, don't cry.
I know it sucks being blindsided.
It's just always something with Ana.
And I feel like if I never started talking to her,
then none of this would've happened.
No, that's not true.
Now we can't get rid of her.
And, what, is, like, Mike gonna marry her?
I highly doubt that.
He's just trying to help her get sober.
Yeah, but what if she starts doing drugs again?
She can't take care of a baby, Mom. Even with Mike's help.
Thank you for letting me stay.
Of course. Fresh squeezed and full of folic acid.
What's wrong?
I thought about what you said last night.
Ok.
And I know you have the best intentions, but...
...I can't move in here with you.
Why not?
'Cause you're not this baby's father.
So?
And we're not...
We're friends.
That's all I'm offering.
Is friendship. And a hand.
Look, raising a kid is hard on your own.
Brandon's got three parents and sometimes that's not enough.
It's just until the baby's born.
And then you can get your own place and a full-time job.
No strings attached, of any kind.
OK, on three. You ready?
Ready.
One, two, three!
That was awesome! I want to do it again!
Yeah! After me!
You should totally try the rope swing!
Ah! Maybe next time.
Look at that.
Fun, the good old-fashioned way.
That's what I'm talking about.
Where's Hayley?
She left.
Don't worry, her mom'll be home when she gets back.
We also broke up.
What?
Well, did she say anything about my dance team?
Yeah, she said something about somewhere you could shove it.
Hey! Hey, can we please just get along.
Great. Now she knows our secret dystopian robot theme.
Hey, come in! Family swim!
Oh, no, no, no.
This suit is dry-clean only.
Wait, no! No!
Yes!
Here we go!
Nice!
All right, who's next?
No! No pushing Moms.
She's right.
Only moms get to push moms.
Are you OK?
No!
Don't you laugh! Guess who's going in next?
No! No! No!
Who wins? Me! I win!
Watch out!
Sorry, Mom.
Really?
It was her!
