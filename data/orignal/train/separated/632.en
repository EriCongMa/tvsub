I'm taking the shot.
No, no!
We don't know if Padma's still alive.
We were hoping to involve you
with the campaign in a more official capacity.
They tape their meetings.
Been holding on to it in case Grayson came after me.
I've given some thought to your offer. I accept.
This just came for you. It's marked "Urgent."
You've been keeping something from me, Mason.
A very lonely 16-year-old girl
surrendered her firstborn son.
Victoria.
She has another son.
All too often, we mask truth in artifice...
concealing ourselves for fear of losing the ones we love...
康拉德·格雷森
or prolonging a deception for those we wish to expose.
描述一个影响了你的人 以及他是如何做到的
We hide behind that which brings us comfort
from pain and sadness...
or use it to repel a truth too devastating to accept.
Durand.
Well, you'll notice I left "Detective" off there
since you haven't found Padma yet.
You're lucky I even call you back, Ross.
Why?
'Cause I really thought that we mended fences
after you misguidedly
questioned me in her disappearance.
I don't know. What was it, six weeks ago?
That was routine. Telling you every day
we have no new leads isn't.
So unless you have something new, I got a job to do.
I wish I did.
Like I told you,
it's the first 48 hours that matter the most,
and we're--
968 hours past that.
Right. Got it.
How long have you been here?
I'm worried about you.
After I lost Padma,
I found this.
She says that she's lucky that I didn't abandon her
after everything that happened.
She said she'd wait for me forever.
She's somewhere...
out there, Ems, waiting for me.
Nolan--
Look, I have to believe it.
You know, even if every alley
that I run down is a dead end.
And every time I try to help with Padma,
Amanda, or...
even the white-haired man last year, I... fail.
Don't forget that you saved Jack's life.
已回城 需要见一面
Wow. Start your reveng-ines.
That's him, right on cue.
Look, I know he's getting in deep with the Graysons.
So... what do you two have brewing?
I had nothing to do with that.
Jack still won't let me in.
Nolan, your friends need you.
You can't keep hiding away in this cave.
And if we're gonna find Padma,
I think I have a good idea. You just need to trust me.
Ah, the R.S.V.P.s to the Grayson masquerade...
each one a person
who'll pretend to be your friend for the night.
You know, try as you might,
you are not gonna ruin my good mood for the day,
or my ball, which, if memory serves,
we had to cancel last year due to your murder charge.
Yeah, don't remind me.
Lisi Miller can't make it.
It appears she's headed
for a friend's "destination divorce,"
whatever that is.
But Sloane Hanover's going to be there.
She's dying to see you.
You're dying to set me up.
Well, it has been over six weeks since
your failed reconciliation attempt with Emily.
Yes, based on a threat from the Initiative.
The picture and the bullets, remember?
You know I'd never risk Emily's life,
no matter how much I want her by my side.
Well, all the more reason not to hold out hope.
Regardless, I'm looking forward to tonight.
The women will come, whether I bid them or not.
Like you've ever approved of any girl I've chosen myself.
For good reason.
Conrad's at the Stowaway.
Shouldn't you be there as well?
Yes, but these R.S.V.P.S came to campaign headquarters.
I thought you'd appreciate it if I dropped them off.
Ah, the lovely people who've bought their way in.
And apparently one who's been waiting
40 years for the honor.
In addition to the charming message,
It's postmarked 1973.
So either someone's having a good Halloween laugh,
or the postal service really has outdone itself.
The nausea you've been feeling
and the dizziness-- they're symptoms of pregnancy.
You're between seven and eight weeks along.
Is the baby's father still in the picture?
Would you like to call your parents?
I don't live with them.
You have a choice ahead of you--
one that's going to affect the rest of your life.
You're right.
This is just a seasonal trifle,
not unlike yourself.
So did you get through to Nolan?
I hope so.
I'm worried about him.
I've never seen him in such a state.
Yeah, that my misjudgment placed him in.
You can't carry this burden alone, Aiden.
I had a hand in this.
Well, I was there when Padma was taken, Emily, not you.
There's still the smallest chance that she's alive.
I promised Nolan we'd try to find her.
Yeah, but in order to do that,
we have to draw out Trask.
And now he's in possession of Carrion,
he's gonna lay in wait. We've lost our leverage.
Not entirely.
We still have one card left to play.
Torpedo the initiative's investments?
I mean, it's risky. Daniel could fire me.
And then we've both lost access to Daniel.
It's now or never, Aiden.
I owe it to Nolan.
Yeah, we both do.
So what's the occasion?
Well, I know that Victoria got the R.S.V.P.
Now I just need to make sure she takes it seriously.
I'm just sorry you won't be at the ball to see your handiwork.
I wouldn't strike me off your dance card just yet.
How do you plan to protect local business if your platform
includes coastal redistricting and development?
Uh, these people are townies.
Are there any of them smart enough to ask that?
Believe it or not, yes.
But to ensure that none of them lobs a grenade,
I had them presubmit their questions
So you would be prepared, so...
So a body can't stand without a healthy backbone.
When I'm elected, I'll maintain
the working-class stake in ownership
and distribute dividends at all levels.
Don't say "working class."
I mean, governor's a job, too.
Some of these people aren't working.
Say, uh, say "your."
I plan to maintain your stake in ownership.
Mr. Jack Porter, everyone,
the voice of the populace, the voice of reason,
and the man who helped me close the gap to 4 points.
Knock this out of the park,
and Stoddard won't know what hit him.
Make anyone with a mic
feel like they're the only person in the room.
Tap your inner Clinton.
I can manage that.
But your inner Clinton taps nothing, not anymore.
Right, Ms. Davenport?
Thank god Evan won't be at the masquerade tonight.
Nothing could hide those beady eyes.
But you'll be there, won't you, Jack?
Yeah.
Could help us get another cover,
like the one on the "Post" this morning.
I took the liberty of buying masks for you and your brother.
Wouldn't miss it.
Conrad, you know, with such a late surge,
we are ripe for an October surprise.
Victoria received a suspicious R.S.V.P. this morning.
It said "Expect the unexpected."
And it was postmarked 1973,
which just happens to be the year your opponent
won his first seat on the community board.
Stoddard is trying to rattle us before this event.
Which is why we will be in your ear during the Q&A.
Jack will be there to personalize your responses,
And I'll be at the ready in case anyone goes off book.
And, Conrad...
Hmm?
Wear a tie.
People want to be able to relate to you,
not feel like you're actually related to them.
You are deceptively brilliant.
I learned from the best.
You meant Victoria, didn't you?
Yeah.
Ahh.
Did you pour all of Trask's funds
into Euro-Union securities?
Everyone was shorting, and I thought they were wrong.
No, no, no, no, you weren't thinking.
I have to believe that.
Otherwise, you're trying to destroy my company.
I was taking a gamble, Daniel.
That's the nature of business.
Easy to say when your name
isn't on the damn building.
Let me speak to the client.
Okay, I'll accept the blame
and assure him this won't happen next time.
If we have a next time.
Hello?
Emily, it worked.
Trask showed.
Jack?
In here.
I'm gone a few weeks.
And you've already replaced me with a new B.F.F.
So how do I become a member of this...
unholy alliance?
Boom. You're in.
Where you been hiding?
You haven't returned any of my calls.
Before we get into that saga,
why don't you tell me yours?
Has Conny really converted you into a true believer?
Because, uh, last we spoke,
you were hell-bent on carrying out Amanda's wishes.
Oh, I still am.
But Conrad has me coaching him through an earwig
for this town hall meeting.
I wanted to use that opportunity to...
trip him up.
Trip him up? How?
That's where you come in.
Nate secretly recorded Conrad
practically signing off on Amanda's murder.
Let's say somebody was able to remove
this leverage you're talking about.
I got it from Kenny when I confronted him
about the boat.
Can you help me?
Show me the earwig.
Victoria?
Apologies for the intrusion.
An intrusion is gracing my foyer unannounced.
I don't think I have a word for what this is.
You can call it a peace offering.
I was here for Charlotte and realized
that I hadn't seen you in weeks and...
to ask--
well, hope, actually--
that my invitation to the ball tonight got lost in the mail.
You want to attend?
It is the event of the season.
Well, I'm afraid that no invitation was lost
because none was sent.
Daniel has moved on.
And maybe you should, too.
This isn't about Daniel.
Well, it may be Halloween,
but certain ghosts are best left outside.
It's funny.
The last time you spoke of ghosts
was at Amanda's funeral.
How you wanted to protect your children so...
you don't outlive them.
Did I say that?
You put it more elegantly, of course.
You said that losing a child
goes against the natural order of things.
Well...
It's no secret that I'll do anything for my children.
Well, have a lovely evening, Victoria.
I'm sorry to miss it.
Bold move you made today.
It will have repercussions.
My colleague got ahead of himself.
And you, it would seem.
Listen, I'll get your money back, Mr. Trask.
There's no need to hurt anyone, all right?
Why should I do such a thing?
Maybe to back up a threat.
Like the one you made to me and my girlfriend.
Since you seem to know who we are,
you should understand that
we don't threaten in two dimensions.
We act in three.
Right, and when you do, you rain down destruction.
Whatever horror stories your parents have told you, Daniel,
we've evolved.
The world is busy destroying itself.
The real money is in helping rebuild it,
which is why we're liquidating our assets in Grayson Global,
effectively immediately.
Listen, that's an overreaction.
I can get Mathis in line.
I don't think you can.
There's more to him than you know.
Why? What's he up to?
Today?
Opening the door for us to leave your company
and part as gentlemen.
But tomorrow? He's your problem.
Well, then it's been a pleasure
doing business with you, Mr. Trask.
I'm glad you know when to take the win.
Daniel.
Emily,
Hi.
It's so good to hear your voice.
Is now a good time?
For what, exactly?
I haven't heard from you in six weeks.
I know. I'm--I'm sorry.
But it was all for your protection.
I assumed you were doing it for me.
What changed?
I took the win.
I want to celebrate with you tonight at the masquerade.
Daniel, your mother made it very clear to me
that she didn't want me there.
Well... I guess we're lucky her disapproval
will be stuffed behind a mask.
Listen, I'm already in the city,
so I'll see you there?
It's a date.
Charlotte, that's a look I know well.
Standing in the present,
but living in the past.
I was just thinking about Amanda.
I just can't believe she's gone.
That is something I understand more than you could know.
These just arrived for you, Mrs. Grayson.
Do you want them displayed?
You can set them on the table, Marta. Thank you.
Black roses? Freaky.
Who sent them?
你亲爱的儿子
They're just from the florist,
thanking us for our business.
It's one rose short.
Well, let's not overlook the thoughtful intent.
A symbol of dying love?
Seems more disturbing than thoughtful.
Confirmed.
All funds should be transferred immediately.
Accelerate to phase two.
Take Lexington.
It's faster this time of day.
Unless you know a more direct route to Padma Lahari.
Which my health care plan supports.
I mean, my heart's with your grandmother, Miss Dailey,
and everyone living with Alzheimer's.
I know that she values you there by her bedside,
teaching her the world as I'm sure she taught you.
I mean, we're nothing without our families.
And yours is lucky to have two such strong women.
I thank you, Eileen, for your question.
Mr. Grayson,
This is Tom Mullen.
Uh, Mr. Mullen...
Tom Mullen is the owner of Tom's Crab Shack.
Before you fire away,
I just want to thank you for the best crab cakes
this town has to offer.
And I'm certainly gonna have
some flown to Albany if I ever get homesick.
Well, thank you, Mr. Grayson.
Amanda Porter was a friend of mine.
And I know we all miss her.
Yeah.
So my question is,
when the truth about jury tampering
in her father's trial came out,
You vowed to take action.
What's your plan, or are you gonna allow the government
to sweep David Clarke under the rug again?
Where the hell did that question come from?
Now look, uh...
Let's say somebody was able
to remove this leverage you're talking about.
Is the deal back on?
As it stands, Mr. Ryan,
That's a purely hypothetical question.
Tom, look,
I speak for my late wife when I say
I personally asked Conrad not to--
No, I'll--I'll answer. I'll answer, Jack.
Tom, when I'm elected,
I fully intend to reopen that case.
And if judicial impropriety is proven,
I will take every appropriate measure
to secure a presidential pardon for David Clarke.
Next question, please.
I can't believe that you dragged David Clarke
into the conversation one week before the election.
Well, I was double tapped with a rogue question.
I gave the only answer I knew would stop their next salvo.
"Their"?
I thought you believed that Kenny Ryan
was behind the stunt.
Yeah, I did.
Until I found this.
Ashley mentioned that you'd received
a disquieting correspondence this morning,
And I'm assuming that this was accompanied
by the bouquet of black roses
I found in the garbage downstairs.
"From your loving son."
Well, we can be certain that that's not Daniel.
And here I thought I knew all the skeletons
in your closet by name.
It's nothing, Conrad.
Three words that never quell doubt.
Victoria, we are this close
from actually having a shot at winning,
So I'm asking you...
Please.
I was pregnant once.
My mother's boyfriend-- he...
Victoria, I'm glad you're here.
So you can take care of it for me,
and no one will ever know?
It was the worst time of my life...
That someone has obviously chosen to haunt me with.
Could it be him?
Suffice it to say, that's not possible.
So the pregnancy was terminated?
Then we're--we will make it through this,
Victoria, together.
And trust me, I'm gonna ferret out the guilty party.
Thank you for understanding, Conrad.
I try to keep the ghosts out...
But they always force their way back in.
I ask again,
what impact does this chippy's existence have on anything?
If you had a conscience, you'd know.
We're both killers, Mr. Mathis.
Let's not pretend otherwise.
She got what she wanted.
She's with her father now.
Joined him earlier today.
Well, you kept her alive for six weeks.
In preparation for what?
You'll know in time. Everything has its purpose--
Girlfriends, little sisters who love their heroin.
Even motion detectors... can illuminate a room.
And do the same for the authorities,
which is why, in a few moments,
The police will find you standing over one dead body.
Or if you should choose to pull that trigger, Two.
I'm not gonna shoot you.
This is for Padma...
and our fathers...
and Colleen.
They say that life is defined by the roles we play.
And if you've joined us this hallowed evening,
it can only mean that you've played them well.
So tonight leave your identities at the door,
let our spirits inspire yours,
and may your ornate facades lead you to intrigue.
And as your hosts
and future first lady and governor of this great state...
Let the masquerade commence.
Would you say this projects electability?
More so than the man behind it.
Is it possible I wasn't clear when we spoke earlier?
Actually, it turns out that Daniel asked me to be his date.
But if it bothers you, Victoria,
You can pretend that I left Emily Thorne at the door.
To a lovely evening.
Thank you for helping Jack tonight
And for making my father's case a campaign promise.
I can't believe Conrad Grayson just got my vote.
Well, I know you've got all your moves mapped out,
But I saw a chance, And I took it.
I hope that's okay.
It's more than okay, Nolan.
Thank you.
Who knew the Porter brothers could pull off masks?
That's exactly what I want to do is pull this thing off.
Sometimes self-deception can be therapeutic.
So can free grub. Who's coming with me?
Can't have champagne wishes without caviar dreams.
I heard about what you did for Amanda today.
It was really wonderful.
Just looking for justice where it's due.
Are you okay?
Yeah. I'm okay. Thank you.
There she is.
I'm glad you joined me tonight.
You, too, Porter, and thank you
for all you've done on my father's behalf.
Somehow, You got him electable and out of my way.
But if you don't mind,
Emily and I have six weeks to catch up on, so...
No, no. No, no.
Look, David Clarke isn't even a first-term concern.
No, ensuring that your taxes don't go up is.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Scott.
Don't worry. It's nonalcoholic.
I'll be totally alert when we get the polling tomorrow.
My assumption is that you were sober this afternoon,
and now I'm missing the masquerade to field calls
from anxious supporters.
Someone's got Nate's tapes,
either Kenny or Jack Porter--
Neither of whom possesses the sophistication for such a ploy.
To say nothing of the fact that Jack actually came to my defense.
Or maybe it's someone who canvassed for Stoddard
when he was in college.
Namely, your campaign manager Evan Spradlin,
who we know paid Kenny off in exchange for his silence.
You know, the sound...
of you shilling these self-serving theories
reminds me of your protestations of bewilderment
in the wake of the mothers and daughters united event last year.
So either you're the fox in the hen house,
or you're desperately bad at protecting it.
Then fire me.
What, this late in the campaign?
I will say that once I'm elected,
You can add this to your long list of jobs that you can't handle.
I didn't mean to startle you, Mrs. Grayson.
Sloane, it's so nice to see a friendly face.
I'm so glad you accepted my invitation.
I was, too,
until I saw Danny back on the arm of the ice queen.
Well, I always thought the two of you were a much better fit.
Give them a few days. They'll have parted ways again.
Then I guess you haven't seen it.
Reunited and it feels so good
Excuse me.
"Page six. " Is this your idea of a joke?
Do you realize the perilous implications of being together?
You mean the threat?
Yes, Daniel, I do.
Do you honestly believe that woman is worth your life?
Well, luckily, that's not a choice I have to make.
And I do believe these are yours.
Feel free to use one for each of your two faces.
Where have you been? What happened with Trask?
He's at the bottom of the east river.
He killed Colleen... and Padma.
Well, well. Every opera needs its phantom.
Nolan, we should, uh, we should take a walk outside.
Why?
Padma?
Nolan, I'm so sorry.
Six weeks of holding out hope.
I'm such an idiot.
Nolan, please stop.
These people-- they just...
She got dragged into this because of me.
I am to blame.
No, you're not.
Yes, I am, and so are you and everyone else that let this happen!
You're right. I'm sorry.
I ju-- I loved her.
She loved you.
She's gone.
Em, she's gone.
You... You need... You have to get back in there.
No, this doesn't matter anymore.
Yes... Ems, it does.
I'm not leaving you alone, Nolan.
I love you, too.
I just... I have to deal with this on my own.
I'll be okay. I, uh, I promise.
Couldn't they at least have made it a real costume party?
Like you wouldn't have still slutted it up?
No, you moron. Just to rattle these corpses,
I would've come as Amanda Clarke.
Though I guess that is slutting it up.
Truth.
Is it also true that the baby only survived the fall
'cause she was rocking a tequila placenta?
Shut up, Regina.
Sorry, Harlot. I'm kidding.
I mean, everyone knows that drugs made Amanda think she could fly.
Charlotte! What just happened?
You okay?
Hey, no, no. You guys gotta go. Now. Go.
What happened? Are you okay?
You wouldn't believe what they were saying.
Those two aren't worth it. You gotta let it go.
I want to, but I can't.
Come here.
I didn't know if you'd be coming back or not.
Believe it or not, Nolan forced me.
Well, he knows you as well as you him.
Are you ready for this?
I will be.
So you and Daniel are back together.
Not officially. He was just my way in tonight.
Well, he may disagree with you.
Your picture's on "Page six. "
Daniel's clever.
There's no turning back once you go public.
Daniel.
I bumped into Emily on my way in,
and naturally I inferred that you two got back together,
which she confirmed, so congratulations.
Well, at least you had good instincts about something today, right?
Just kidding, Mathis.
I hope this isn't too awkward for you.
No, all is fair in love and war, as they say.
So can I get either of you a cocktail?
Oh, we're good, but help yourself.
My family spared no expense.
Thank you.
Ruling with a velvet fist?
I'm not letting him out of my sight
until I know what he's up to.
Hey, enough work talk.
Tonight... You're all I care about.
Refill, please.
Thank you for having me, Mrs. Grayson.
It's a lovely party. Everybody seems to be having a great time.
I heard Charlotte hit somebody.
Must be that blue-collar influence
her father's so keen to embrace.
Mr. Grayson did a remarkable job at the town hall meeting today.
You mean by endorsing the quest for David Clarke's pardon?
Well,that would be a victory for your late wife.
There's no victory for Amanda.
She's gone,
which is why my child's being raised without a mother.
You realize the decision you make is permanent.
Victoria,are you okay?
Well,we actually got a small bump
in the liberal enclaves from this David Clarke thing.
One can infer that they really do value justice above all.
Who has the polling from the northern districts?
Uh, yeah. You took a hit.
I wasn't aware that you were working from home today.
Well,I wanted to be here for you,my dear.
Excuse us.
And keep making those calls.
Someone's responsible for what happened yesterday.
I want a name.
You feeling better?
Yes,thank you.
Coffee?
Tea? Muffin?
You may need your strength while you're explaining
what could possibly have happened to you last night
that you wound up unconscious on the ballroom floor.
I was upset
because our son has once again put his life on the line
and our daughter Has been throwing punches at party guests.
and after you browbeat me
into reliving memories that were best laid to rest,
it's no wonder I fainted.
Or could it be that
you've lied to me about the pregnancy
you claim to have terminated?
You want proof?
I want something I can believe.
Fine. I'll give it to you,
but you will never speak of this again.
I didn't hear from you
so I assume you were either with Nolan or Daniel.
I talked to Nolan.
He said he made it through the night okay.
That's why I'm here.
I hate that it has to be this way.
You hate it?
Well,if it were up to me,I'd put a bullet in his head.
Well,it's not up to you.
Clearly.
And you know that Daniel is not my focus.
Victoria is.
You can't be jealous of somebody that I don't even care about--
I'm not jealous, Emily. I'm disgusted.
But I'm gonna deal with it the best I can.
Well,like it or not, You're gonna have to deal with Daniel.
Trask must have said something,
because he's looking into your past.
I've done my due diligence.
You can't erase your father, Aiden.
And if Daniel turns to the falcon, he could learn everything.
Now I've killed Trask,
he's our only way of finding out what phase two is.
Well,then we have to get to him before Daniel does.
Right.
Or it could threaten my time in the Hamptons.
I'm tracking Victoria's cell phone signal.
Looks like we're all heading into the city.
Yeah.
But separately.
I got your text. What'd you want to talk about?
I'll see you in a second, buddy, okay?
Be right back.
I heard the way Conrad talked to you at the party.
Just a bad day on the campaign trail.
I doubt that.
Have they ever treated you well?
Charlotte told me the Graysons banished you,
and you had to come back on your own. Is that true?
So?
So I think that we're in this for the same thing--
to get what we can from Conrad
before we take him down.
The only reason you'd suspect Kenny Ryan of what happened yesterday
is if you knew what Nate did to my wife for Conrad's benefit.
You played the tape? You placed the question?
And you know why I did?
Because when he becomes governor, where does it end?
I need... your help.
And I know you're not one of them.
And what happened with Amanda--
you have to know that I was not involved.
We wouldn't be standing here if you were.
So you with me?
Destroying evidence?
When we questioned you, you claimed to know nothing.
After seeing... this, It's hard to believe,
Especially when the coroner said she died yesterday.
Yesterday?
I spoke to you in the morning.
Your colleagues say that you left there soon after. Where'd you go?
I'm not saying a word.
Thank you for seeing me, sister.
You realize that the decision you make is permanent
and that a vow is sacrosanct.
Once taken, I shall never break it.
I do, sister.
Then I promise to find your son the best possible home
and never to tell him who his mother is.
You forgot the last promise.
I didn't.
I want you to be sure.
Then I promise never to tell you what becomes of him.
I kept those promises, Victoria,
Even when he came for you those years ago.
and he hasn't come again.
When you saw him,did he seem happy?
He was a young man looking for his mother,
which is a quest of hope.
So take from that what you will.
Thank you, sister.
For everything.
What can I do for you, my dear?
Sister, I need your help.
I'm pregnant
And I have nowhere else to go.
