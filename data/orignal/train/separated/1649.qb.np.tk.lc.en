new more details about the new star trek film .
there &apos;s going to be a scene depicting spock &apos;s birth .
i &apos;d be more interested
in a scene depicting spock &apos;s conception .
oh , please .
for vulcans , mating-- or if you will , pon fahr--
it &apos;s an extremely private matter .
still , i &apos;d like to know the details .
his mother was human .
his father is vulcan .
they couldn &apos;t just conceive .
maybe they had to go to a clinic .
can you imagine spock &apos;s dad in a little room
with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears .
how come on star trek
everybody &apos;s private parts are the same ?
no alien lady ever told captain kirk ,
&quot; hey , get your thing out of my nose . &quot;
hi. can you help me ?
i was writing an e @-@ mail and the &quot; a &quot; key got stuck .
now it &apos;s just going &quot; aaa ... &quot;
what &apos;d you spill on it ?
nothing .
diet coke .
and yogurt .
and a little nail polish .
i &apos;ll take a look at it .
gentlemen , switching to local nerd news--
fishman , chen , chaudury and mcnair aren &apos;t fielding a team
in the university physics bowl this year .
you &apos;re kidding. why not ?
they formed a barbershop quartet and got a gig
playing knott &apos;s berry farm .
wow , so in your world
you &apos;re like the cool guys .
recognize .
this is our year .
with those guys out , the entire physics bowl
will kneel before zod .
zod ?
kryptonian villain. long story .
good story .
well , count me out .
what ? why ?
you want me to use my intelligence
in a tawdry competition ?
would you ask
picasso to play pictionary ?
would you ask noah webster to play boggle ?
would you ask jacques cousteau to play go fish ?
come on , you need a four @-@ person team .
we &apos;re four people .
by that reasoning we should also
play bridge , hold up a chuppah
and enter the olympic bobsled competition .
tickets to that , please .
sheldon , what , do i need to quote
spock &apos;s dying words to you ?
no , don &apos;t .
&quot; the needs of the many ...
... &quot; outweigh the needs of the few .
... or the one . &quot;
damn it , i &apos;ll do it .
okay , first order of physics bowl business
we need a truly kick @-@ ass team name .
suggestions ?
how about the perpetual motion squad ?
it &apos;s beyond the laws of physics , plus
a little heads @-@ up for the ladies .
the ladies ?
&quot; perpetual motion squad-- we can go all night . &quot;
i like it .
i don &apos;t .
teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures ,
thus intimidating one &apos;s opponent .
then we could be the bengal tigers .
poor choice .
gram for gram ,
no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength
of the army ant .
maybe so ,
but you can &apos;t incinerate a bengal tiger
with a magnifying glass .
let &apos;s put it to a vote .
all those in favor ... point of order .
i move that any vote on team names
must be unanimous .
no man should be forced to emblazon his chest
with a bengal tiger when common sense dictates
it should be an army ant .
will the gentleman from the great state of denial
yield for a question ?
i will yield .
after we go through the exercise
of an annoying series of votes ,
all of which the gentleman will lose ,
does he then intend to threaten to quit
if he does not get his way ? he does .
i move we are the army ants. all those in favor ?
good afternoon , and welcome
to today &apos;s physics bowl practice round .
i &apos;m penny , and i &apos;ll be your host
because apparently i didn &apos;t have anything else to do
on a saturday afternoon ,
and isn &apos;t that just a little sad ?
gentlemen , are you ready ?
yes. of course. fire away .
you know , it &apos;s none of my business ,
but isn &apos;t a guy who can &apos;t speak
in front of women going to hold you back a little ?
oh , he &apos;ll be okay
once the women are mixed into the crowd .
he only has a problem when they &apos;re one @-@ on @-@ one
and smell nice .
ah , thanks , raj. it &apos;s vanilla oil .
i was actually the one who noticed .
okay , let &apos;s just start .
okay , the first question
is on the topic of optics .
&quot; what is the shortest light pulse ever produced ? &quot;
dr. cooper .
and of course the answer is 130 attoseconds .
that is correct . i knew that , too .
good for you , sweetie .
ok , next question .
&quot; what is the quantum mechanical effect
&quot; used to encode data on hard @-@ disk drives ? &quot;
howard ?
and of course the answer is
giant magnetoresistance. right .
hey , i buzzed in .
and i answered. it &apos;s called teamwork .
don &apos;t you think i should answer
the engineering questions ? i am an engineer .
by that logic i should answer
all the anthropology questions because i &apos;m a mammal .
just ask another one .
okay .
&quot; what artificial satellite has seen glimpses
of einstein &apos;s predicted frame dragging ? &quot;
2004年发射升空 任务是探测地球附近的时空曲率
and of course , it &apos;s gravity probe b .
sheldon ,
you have to let somebody else answer .
why ?
because it &apos;s polite .
what do manners have to do with it ?
this is war .
were the romans polite when they salted the ground
of carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again ?
leonard , you said i only had to ask questions .
the objective of the competition is to give correct answers .
if i know them , why shouldn &apos;t i give them ?
some of us might have the correct answers , too .
oh , please. you don &apos;t even have a phd .
all right , that &apos;s it !
howard , sit down. okay .
maybe we should take a little break .
good idea . i need my wrist brace .
all this button @-@ pushing
is aggravating my old nintendo injury .
i agree .
what did he say ?
he compared sheldon
to a disposable feminine cleansing product
one might use on a summer &apos;s eve .
yeah , and the bag it came in .
leonard , excellent .
i want to show you something .
can it wait ? i need to talk to you .
just look .
i &apos;ve designed the perfect uniforms for our team .
the colors are based on star trek the original series .
the three of you will wear support red ,
and i will wear command gold .
why do they say &quot; aa &quot; ?
army ants .
isn &apos;t that confusing ?
&quot; aa &quot; might mean
something else to certain people .
why would a physics bowl team
be called anodized aluminum ?
no , i meant ...
never mind .
hey , check it out ,
i got you a batman cookie jar .
oh , neat !
what &apos;s the occasion ?
well , you &apos;re a friend , and you like batman
and cookies , and you &apos;re off the team .
what ?
howard , raj and i just had a team meeting .
no , you didn &apos;t. yes , we did . i just came from there .
okay , i don &apos;t know where you just came from ,
but it could not have have been a team meeting
because i &apos;m on the team and i wasn &apos;t there .
ergo , the team did not meet .
ok. let me try it this way .
i was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends ,
and one thing led to another ,
and it turns out you &apos;re off the team .
why ?
because you &apos;re taking all the fun out of it .
i &apos;m sorry ,
is the winner of the physics bowl
the team that has the most fun ?
ok. let me try it this way .
you &apos;re annoying
and no one wants to play with you anymore .
i see .
well , at this point i should inform you
that i intend to form my own team
and destroy the molecular bonds
that bind your very matter together
and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears .
thanks for the heads @-@ up .
you &apos;re welcome .
one more thing. yes ?
it &apos;s on . b.i.t.c.h.
so who &apos;d he get to be on his team ?
he won &apos;t say .
he just smiles and eats macaroons out of his bat jar .
he &apos;s using psychological warfare .
we must reply in kind .
i say we wait until he looks at us ,
then laugh like , &quot; yes , you are a smart and strong competitor ,
&quot; but we are also smart and strong ,
and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you . &quot;
how exactly would that laugh go ?
that sounds more like , &quot; we are a tall ,
thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your dalmatians . &quot;
guys , let &apos;s remember
that sheldon is still our friend and my roommate .
so ?
so nothing .
let &apos;s destroy him .
gentlemen .
okay , we &apos;re going to need a strong fourth for our team .
you know who is apparently very smart
is the girl who played tv &apos;s blossom .
she got a phd. in neuroscience or something .
raj , we &apos;re not getting tv &apos;s blossom
to join our physics bowl team .
how about the girl from the wonder years ?
gentlemen , i believe i &apos;ve found the solution
to all our problems .
we can &apos;t ask leslie winkle .
why ? because you slept together ,
and when she was done with you
she discarded you like last night &apos;s chutney ?
yes .
sometimes you &apos;ve got to take one for the team .
yeah , sack up , dude .
fine .
here i go , taking one for the team ...
in the sack .
hey , leslie .
hi , guys .
so , leslie , i have a question for you ,
and it might be
a little awkward , you know , given that i ...
hit that thang .
leonard , there &apos;s no reason to feel uncomfortable
just because we &apos;ve seen each other &apos;s faces
and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus .
there &apos;s not ?
gee , &apos; cause it sure sounds like there should be .
rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship
regarding your preferences ,
your idiosyncrasies , your performance
are still protected by the inherent
confidentiality of the bedroom .
that &apos;s all very comforting , but if it &apos;s okay ,
i &apos;d like to get on to my question now .
proceed .
we are entering the physics bowl ,
and we need a fourth for our team .
no , thanks .
i &apos;m really busy with my like @-@ sign dilepton
supersymmetry search .
dilepton , shmylepton. we need you .
sorry .
well , we tried .
we &apos;ll just have to face sheldon mano y mano
y mano a mano .
wait , you &apos;re going up against sheldon cooper ?
yes .
that arrogant , misogynistic , east texas doorknob
that told me i should abandon my work
with high @-@ energy particles for laundry and childbearing ?
she &apos;s in .
so , how do you feel ?
nice and loose ?
come to play ?
got your game face on ?
are you ready ?
yeah. you know , you don &apos;t have to stay for the whole thing .
oh , no , no . i want to .
sounds really interesting .
gentlemen .
sheldon .
sheldon .
sheldon .
i &apos;m just gonna sit down .
so , is that your team ?
actually , i don &apos;t need a team .
i could easily defeat you single @-@ handedly ,
but the rules require four .
so , may i introduce the third @-@ floor janitor ,
the lady from the lunch room , and my spanish is not good--
either her son or her butcher .
and what about your team ?
what rat have you recruited to the s.s. sinking ship ?
hello , sheldon .
leslie winkle .
yeah , leslie winkle .
the answer to the question ,
&quot; who made sheldon cooper cry like a little girl ? &quot;
yes , well , i &apos;m polymerized tree sap ,
and you &apos;re an inorganic adhesive .
so whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction
is reflected off of me ,
returns on its original trajectory
and adheres to you .
oh , ouch !
okay , if everyone could please take your seats .
here &apos;s your t @-@ shirt .
pms ?
it &apos;s a couple days early ...
no. it stands for &quot; perpetual motion squad . &quot;
oh , right , of course .
what was i thinking ?
good afternoon , everyone ,
and welcome to this year &apos;s physics bowl !
today &apos;s preliminary match features two great teams .
aa versus ...
pms .
all night long , y &apos;all !
okay , well , let &apos;s jump right in .
first question
for ten points .
&quot; what is the iso @-@ spin singlet partner of the pi @-@ zero meson ? &quot;
pms ?
the eta meson .
correct .
formal protest .
on what grounds ?
the velcro on my wrist brace
caught on my shirt .
denied .
all right , for ten points ,
&quot; what is the lightest element on earth
with no stable isotope ? &quot;
aa ?
and of course , the answer is technetium .
terrific .
next question .
&quot; what is the force between two uncharged plates
due to quantum vacuum fluctuations ? &quot;
pms ?
sheldon can suck on ... the casimir effect .
correct .
how does a quantum computer factor large numbers ?
pms ?
shor &apos;s algorithm .
correct !
4.1855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie .
prevost &apos;s theory of exchanges .
lambda equals one over pi r squared n .
760 degrees celsius ...
the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row .
mr. wolowitz , this is your second warning .
a sigma particle .
yes , assuming the hypothetical planet
has a mass greater than the earth .
correct .
ladies and gentlemen , i hold in my hand the final question .
the score now stands . aa 1,150 , pms 1,175 .
so , for 100 points and the match ,
please turn your attention to the formula on the screens .
solve the equation .
holy crap .
what the hell is that ?
looks like something they found on the ship at roswell .
come on. think .
leslie ?
leonard , it &apos;s not gonna work if you rush me .
you have to let me get there .
you are never gonna let that go , are you ?
ten seconds .
pms ?
sorry , i panicked .
then guess .
eight .
.4
i &apos;m sorry , that &apos;s incorrect .
aa.if you can answer correctly , the match is yours .
he doesn &apos;t have it .
he &apos;s got squat .
aa , i need your answer .
the answer is minus eight pi alpha .
hang on. hang on a second .
that &apos;s not our answer .
what are you doing ?
answering question .
winning physics bowl .
how do you know anything about physics ?
here i am janitor .
in former soviet union , i am physicist .
leningrad politechnika .
go polar bears .
well , that &apos;s a delightful little story ,
but our arrangement was that you sit here
and not say anything-- i answer the questions .
you didn &apos;t answer question .
hey , look , now , maybe you have democracy now
in your beloved russia ,
but on this physics bowl team , i rule with an iron fist .
aa , i need your official answer .
well , it &apos;s not what he said .
then what is it ? i want a different question .
you can &apos;t have a different question .
formal protest .
denied .
informal protest .
denied .
i need your official answer .
no . i decline to provide one .
well , that &apos;s too bad because the answer
your teammate gave was correct .
that &apos;s your opinion .
all right , the winner of the match is ...
hang on .
sheldon , is proving that you are single @-@ handedly smarter
than everyone else so important
that you would rather lose by yourself
than win as part of a team ?
i don &apos;t understand the question .
go ahead .
the winner is pms .
sorry , somebody &apos;s sitting there .
who ?
my physics bowl trophy .
that trophy is meaningless .
i forfeited , therefore you did not win .
i know someone who would disagree. who ?
my physics bowl trophy .
leonard is so smart .
sheldon who ?
all right , that is very immature .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m not !
okay , new contest .
what are you doing ?
