You kissed me, remember, in the tent?
Then at the movie theater you held my hand.
I just, I don't get this, I don't get you.
Do you think we made a mistake firing Timothy?
I was five months pregnant and I lost the baby.
And now, our twins' birth mom is pregnant,
and she's asked Stef and me to adopt her baby.
Are you guys gonna take Ana's baby?
I don't think so.
I think I'm gonna ask her if I can.
You bribed them?
I just wanted to make sure Dad didn't go to prison.
Daphne, where are you?
Look, I just wanted you to know
that I told the police about Tasha.
That I took her, it's over,
so you could stay with Jude at the Fosters.
What's going on, Callie?
I did something wrong and I couldn't tell you.
Is this why you're going to live with Robert?
I just thought that if I left on my own it wouldn't hurt as much
as if you told me to go but it does.
OK, listen...
It hurts so much.
Look at me. Nothing you can do is gonna make us not want you.
You're wasting your time, Stef. You're too late.
Well, I'm not going down without a fight.
All we're asking is to go back
to the 180 day waiting period, or what's left of it.
And when the judge asks why?
We say Callie needs more time. To get to know Robert.
And this just suddenly occurred to her?
Yes. While she was packing
to leave a home she feels safe and secure in
to go live with a man she hardly knows.
Paperwork's done. The wheels are in motion.
So, stop them, Marie.
No, it's my fault.
It's not your fault, it's Robert's fault.
He knew that you were lying to
the judge when you asked to gand live with him.
OK, what if Robert asked the judge to give Callie more time?
That's interesting.
Why would he do that when he's so close to getting what he wants.
If Callie asked him, in front of the judge,
I mean, he wants to be seen like a loving father.
So, put him on the spot?
Would you be comfortable doing that?
I guess. But, even if we get more time...
All right, first things first.
I just don't feel like you
should be spending any more money on lawyers,
no offense, if the judge is just gonna
make me go live with him anyway.
Let us worry about the money, love.
The immediate goal right now is to keep you in this house,
with us, for as long as possible.
Thanks, Maria.
I'll call the judge in the morning.
OK.
But look, Callie's got a point.
This judge is clearly biased toward the birth father.
I hate to see you to spend more money jumping through hoops
just to delay what's inevitable.
I have no intention of waiting for the inevitable.
You got something up your sleeve?
Oh. Sorry.
It's OK. I'm just brushing my teeth.
So, did they talk to you about the tour yet?
Uh, no, not yet, but, I'm like 110 persent sure I'm not going.
I'm so sorry.
Stop. It's not the end of the world.
Have you told the band?
Not yet.
I'm gonna do it tonight, I figure, all together.
You're not gonna give Lou a heads up?
Uh, I figure safety in numbers.
I have to brush my teeth!
Get in line.
I'm so sick of sharing a bathroom!
Seriously?
What? I gotta brush, too.
No! Out! We're at capacity!
What're you so spun out about?
Oh, nothing, just that Callie's moving out,
um, I can't find anyone to dance on my dance team,
Jesus is going to boarding school,
but other than that, I'm awesome.
You're going to boarding school?
You're going to boarding school?
No... maybe... probably not.
They offered him a scholarship.
Academic?
No. Wrestling. And the school's in Colorado.
I thought you said I could go.
I never said I'd be happy about it.
And you're probably gonna have to move in with Jude.
Jude? Why?
To make room for the baby.
What baby?
What baby?
It's not for sure.
They're gonna do it. Moms wanted a baby and Ana's having a girl
and she's our sister, and it's perfect.
How could they not? It's like fate.
We're gonna be late.
It's not gonna happen.
How do you know?
I talked to Moms.
Good, it means I don't have to move in with Jude.
I mean, I guess that's too bad about Ana.
And Mariana. She's gonna be really upset.
Why haven't they told her?
I don't know if they told Ana.
Forgot mascara!
You know what? You should ask Emma to be on the dance team.
Yeah, right.
I'm serious.
She used to be a cheerleader, in junior high.
Emma?
Did you get the email from Marie?
No.
How many times have we told them not to leave the milk out?
What'd it say?
The judge will see us at 12:30.
Does that work for you?
I guess it has to.
I really don't like Callie having to put on a show.
It's not a show, love. This is what she wants.
It sure as hell's not what Robert wants.
I don't see any world in which
he's going to ask the judge to delay his getting custody.
You never know.
By the way, Jesus wants us to
reschedule the meeting with the Flintwood scout.
I thought he said he wasn't ready to leave home?
Apparently, Mariana thinks it would be good for him. So...
You know, Monte went to boarding school.
Oh, did she? Didn't know that.
She said it saved her life.
Hmm. Had a troubled youth, did she?
She said it was the only reason she got into a good college.
She probably went to Harvard.
Princeton, actually.
Well, la-de-da. Since we're running all our big family decisions
past your new boss, maybe I should meet her.
I thought you wanna, run it by Mike?
That's funny.
Seriously, you should invite her to dinner.
Like we have time to entertain. I gotta go.
I love you. All right.
I love you. I'll see you later.

You were a cheerleader?!
That was a long time ago.
Two years is not a long time.
Look, please try out for my dance team.
Look, I quit cheerleading and I started wrestling
because I didn't want to be the silly girl on the sidelines.
I wanted to be in the game.
We are the game. We're not cheering anybody else on.
We're a competitive dance team. And you're very competitive.
I'm just don't feel comforble exploiting my sexuality.
I'm asking you to dance, not to strip.
Look, if you're not gonna do it for me,
do it to avenge all the victims of mean girls everywhere.
And I know you're one of them.
Um, do you have any gum? I didn't brush my teeth this morning.
Exhale.
No.
Come on.
Oh, my God, that's disgusting.
I told you!
I'm just kidding. But seriously, you need some gum.
Hey, so, you want to hang out after school?
We could do our homework?
Sure. You want to come over?
Yeah, I'll meet you at the bench.
Hey, Brandon.
I got your email and I talked to our friends over at Idyllwild.
Unfortunately, it's too late, they gave up your spot.
Yeah, I figured.
However, when I explained to them
why you didn't jump at the scholarship...
Wait, you told them?
Now they'll never consider me.
That's not true.
They said they'd make another spot for you.
If you audition.
You said you played the Bach prelude perfectly.
No, it wasn't perfect.
It just wasn't a disaster. My extension's not the same.
So, practice. It's not like you've got anything to lose.
...but there's many motifs within Silas Marner.
It's a book that explores a plethora of things, including
religion, community, love,
deception, status, and redemption.
So, to answer your original question,
we will be critically examining each of these themes
page by page, and chapter by chapter.
I've just got a few minutes. What's going on?
Your Honor, I understand that Callie is feeling confused
about her decision to come live with me and my family.
And because I want her to feel absolutely certain
and secure in our home, I think she needs more time.
So, you're asking to go back to the waiting period?
Yes, your honor. I still strongly believe
that my daughter belongs with me,
but I'm willing to wait until
we've had a chance to get to know each other better.
Callie, this is what you want?
Yes, sir.
And ladies, I'm assuming this is OK with you?
Yes, Your Honor.
We... We just want Callie to feel safe.
OK. We'll go back to the original plan.
With one amendment.
I think once a week visitation is probably not enough time
for Callie to get to know her father, so in addition,
I'm going to give Mr. Quinn every other weekend as well.
You OK, Cal?
Yeah.
You should get to class.
We'll talk more tonight, OK?
Love you.
Love you.
Love you.
What the hell was that?
Why would Robert ask the judge to give Callie more time
before Callie even asked him?
He knew why we were there.
My bet is he wanted to play the hero, for Callie's benefit.
Well, now she's going to spend every other weekend with him.
Do you think it was really worth it?
Yes, because it bought us time.
For what?
指使孩子从父母或监护人的监护中解脱而获得合法权利
To get Callie emancipated.
If we can get Callie emancipated
before the waiting period is up,
then she's no longer a ward of the state.
She's considered an adult
and wouldn't need anyone's consent to be adopted by us.
And what if Robert finds out? Or the judge?
No, emancipation petitions aren't heard in family court.
And Robert wouldn't find out.
If Callie doesn't tell him,
which is asking her to do exactly what we accused Robert of.
To give her a choice, not take it away.
Which is what Robert is trying to do.
This is a... This is a very gray area.
And so was not reporting callie and Brandon as accessories to a kidnapping.
They were just trying to do the right thing.
So are we.
How long does it take to get emancipated?
It's... It's gonna be tight.
It's gonna be tight.
So this is what you meant by first things first.
And you just decided at this was the plan,
without discussing it with me?
I just... didn't want to get anyone's hopes up,
in case we didn't get the time.
Callie's gonna have to want to do this.
We can't pressure her into it.
We won't.
Ultimately it is up to her.
Let's talk to her about that tonight.
Oh. Hey. I was looking for you.
Uh, Monte, this is my wife, Stef.
It's so nice to meet you. I've heard so many great things.
Likewise. In fact, I was just saying
that we should have you over for dinner some time.
I'd love that.
How about tonight?
Tonight?
I'm sure she has plans.
Actually, I don't. But, are you sure?
Yes.
Yes, we'd love to have you.
So, if we don't find four girls today, we'll just have to...
Concede defeat.
It's not defeat to drop out.
Of course it is. Quitting is way worse than losing.
Yeah, well, I think we're in trouble.
Keep an open mind. You never know.
OK, I'll do it.
No way.
Um, hey, isn't that your foster sister?
Hey. Everything OK?
Yeah. Why?
What are you doing here?
Aren't these open auditions?
Are you...? Oh my God!
Oh, God!
Sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
My dad... said I could practice here.
The piano. He said you wouldn't be home.
Is everything OK?
Uh, yeah. I...
...just got this letter, returned to me, it's silly.
Well, maybe the person moved?
No. It's not the first one they've sent back.
Listen, um...
I'm really sorry I took that money from you.
I shouldn't have done that.
No, I... I shouldn't have...
No, you were just trying to help your dad. He's a good man.
He didn't do anything wrong.
I was lying. I don't even remember why now.
I'll try to pay you back.
No, it's really OK.
My dad gave me money, so...
Then, I'll add it to all I owe him already.
Well, I should get out of here, let you practice.
It's OK, really.
No, I'm supposed to be apartment hunting.
Your dad'll be really happy you're playing piano again.
Five, six, seven, eight.
OK, everybody got it?
Yeah.
Got it.
OK, well, just have fun and bring it.
That was fantastic!
Thank you! Give us just a moment.
So, what'd Mariana promise you to audition?
I'm getting her first born.
Oh, I'm just being supportive,
even if it was slightly humiliating.
So Emma's awesomei
She rocked it
And Grace was better than I thought.
For sure and Ivy?
Moves really well.
They'd never make Kaitlyn's team.
But we're not Kaitlyn's team.
Exactly. We're every woman.
Um, but the two on the right...?
Mm, no bueno.
And. Um, Callie?
Was awesome.
OK, so, my two ladies on the right,
I'm sorry, but thank you for auditioning.
Everyone else... you're in!
Wait, me?
Yes, you!
I'm so excited!
We're a team!
Hey, you ready?
So, what's the deal with Daria?
What'd you mean?
Are you guys gonna like... keep hanging out?
Well, I think it's... it's good
'cause... my dad's cool with us.
'Cause you have a girlfriend?
Well, we all have fun together don't we?
I guess.
So, Daria and Taylor are sneaking out tomorrow night.
通常还会用到鸡蛋和粪便 画面太美请自行脑补
They're gonna go TP some girl's house and they want us to come.
Get out. I have to study.
That's what we're doing.
I can't concentrate with you two in here.
We'll be quiet.
I can hear you breathing. Go use the dining room.
Oh, sorry, you guys, I need to set the table.
We're eating in here?
Monte's coming for dinner.
The principal's coming here?
Yeah, you wanna stay, Connor?
No, thanks.
OK, well, you guys can study out back, please.
I put the water on,
but I don't know why we don't just order in, love.
Because it's expensive
and I don't want the principal of the school
to think we feed the kids take-out every night.
And frankly, I wish you hadn't invited her.
We have so much going on, and we need to talk to Callie.
Talk to me about what?
OK, maybe we can try the living room.
Uh, hey, guys, we're having a little bit of a private conversation.
Uh, OK, sorry.
OK, yeah, I should probably get home anyway.
See you later, Connor.
There's nowhere to be alone in this house.
Hey, if we sneak out, tomorrow night after TP'ing,
we could hangout, you know, by ourselves.
So what would I have to do?
First we get you off probation, your hearing is next week
and your P.O. sees no reason that it won't go well.
Then, you have to prove that you can pay for an apartment
and support yourself.
I can't live with you?
You can. The court needs to see that
you can afford to live on your own.
In case we were to ever asked you to leave,
which we would never do.
An apartment costs a lot of money.
Yeah. You'd have to get a full time job and go to school.
But remember, this is just temporary.
Yeah, as soon as you're emancipated, we can adopt you right away.
And you wouldn't have to maintain any of that.
And you do need to keep this from Robert,
which we don't feel good about.
But sometimes, Callie, the end justify the means.
This is the only way we know,
to give you the choice that you deserve.
So Brandon, your mom...
Are you both "Mom?"
I'm "Mom," she's "Mama."
Your Mama tells me that you might
be going on tour this summer, with your band?
Uh, yeah, I don't think that's happening anymore.
Oh, why do you think that?
Well, it isn't, right?
Well, we have some things to discuss,
but as far as we're concerned, you're good to go.
So Monty, I understand that you went to boarding school.
Mm, yeah, for my last two years of high school.
Is boarding school as wild as they say it is?
Ah, well, not the one that I went to, unfortunately.
I'm sorry Jesus couldn't join us.
I'd love to hear more about Flintwood.
You really see Jesus going to military school?
Nothing's been decided.
Where'd you go to college?
Well, I studied pre-law at Princeton
and then I decided I did not want to be a lawyer
so I got my graduate degree in business.
Oh, from where?
From Yale.
Princeton and Yale.
That's impressive.
What you do is impressive, as far as I'm concerned.
You certainly don't need a degree from Yale
to give out speeding tickets.
I'm sure you do far more than that.
I want to go to an Ivy league school.
Not that we could afford it.
Yeah, maybe you can get like a dance scholarship, you know.
Ha ha.
When are we having this dance-off?
Next week. And guess who joined the team today?
Don't.
Callie!
Really?
Wow, dance team just got a lot more interesting.
Can I please come to your rehearsals?
Can we talk about Timothy?
Oh, sweetheart, why don't
we just wait for the school assembly for that.
I don't mind.
I don't know if he got fired
because he made us read that article on education reform,
but I found it very informative.
It laid out both sides of the debate
and if the point of Common Core is to make us deeper thinkers,
then Timothy should be like... on their poster.
It's true. He's the best teacher I've ever had.
Me, too. Except for music.
He challenges us to consider all points of view
and to think about, like,
not just what we think about something,
but why we think it.
I really look forward to his class. We all do.
No other teacher has made me want to learn as much as he does.
Sorry I'm late.
Mercury's in retrograde, man.
OK, we're all here.
So, what's up?
I just wanted to tell you that I don't think...
I can't go on tour.
Five, six, seven, eight,
step, flick, pop, pop, drop, jump,
hands, hair, hips, OK?
Again. Five, six, seven, eight,
step, flick, pop, pop, drop, jump.
OK... Wait, wider legs, a little bit.
Like this.
Drop, jump, hands, hair, hip hip.
Drop, jump, hands, hips.
OK, but slow it down. It's supposed to look sexy, like this.
Hip hip.
I can't do that.
Well, sure you can, you just flip your hair and smile like:
Ooh, I know you want me.
Yeah, no, I...
Try it.
Ok.
See, that was almost it but actually say it.
Ooh, I know you want me. I'm sexy.
I'm not saying that.
OK, well, loosen up a little bit.
You're so tense here.
Mariana, stop.
Sorry.
I have like a lot of homework I think.
Yeah, sure. We'll pick this up in rehearsal tomorrow.
Great.
Awesome.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Oh, that's good, thanks.
You have a gorgeous home,
and your kids are amazing, what a lovely family.
Oh, thank you. Remember that next time one of them decides
to stage a walk-out.
Mariana's very impressive.
I was really moved by the way she talked about Timothy.
She's very special.
Can I ask that...
Did the kids know that he was your donor?
They did. They did. It was supposed to be anonymous.
Since we are sharing it, it was really funny though
because Jesus came home unexpectedly,
and found Timothy's deposit in our bathroom.
It was just...
Oh, my.
That must have been...
Yeah.
Yeah, extremely... extremely awkward.
But, as you can see, they have a lot of respect for Timothy,
and were very supportive.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
You know, now, seeing how special Mariana is,
I can understand why you're so torn.
Torn about what?
About adopting Ana's baby.
Oh, we are? We're torn?
Did you have anything to do with moms letting me go on tour?
I might have put in a good word.
I wish you hadn't done that.
I thought you wanted to go.
I did, but that was like before when I couldn't...
I got an audition to Idyllwild.
They're gonna give me another shot.
That's great.
Well, no, because I can't do both.
And I really want to go to Idyllwild.
So, tell the band. I'm sure they'll understand.
I'm not sure Lou will understand.
Which is why lied and told them
that my moms changed their minds about letting me go.
I... I think... Do you want to know what I think?
Mm, not really.
What I do want to know is
what the hell are you doing on Mariana's dance team.
I felt bad for her and so I was just trying to be supportive.
I never thought I'd make it. I'm not a good dancer.
Just tell her then.
I'm pretty sure she knows.
Then you don't want to be on the team.
I can't. She needs six dancers. I'm stuck.
Well, I think you should just be honest with her.
Did I ask what you think?
Well, tell you what, if you will, I will.
All I did was tell her that
I was struggling with this decision.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me about your secret emancipation plan?
Is this what we're going to do? Tit for tat? OK.
I'm not gonna feel bad about sharing something with a friend.
Oh, so now she's a friend? That's interesting.
I don't have that many people to talk to.
So talk to me.
Honey, listen, I thought you were very clear about the fact
that you didn't want to adopt Ana's baby.
Well, I'm not.
I'm worried that Mariana will feel like
we don't love her as much as we say we do.
That's ridiculous.
OK. Good talk. Thanks.
Hey, I don't mean that you are ridiculous.
Mariana knows how much we love her, come on.
She was already worried that I'd love Frankie more than her.
And if I wanted a baby that was a part of me,
why wouldn't I want one that's part of her?
Why wouldn't we want a baby
as beautiful as our Mariana?
It's not that simple.
Isn't it?
No, it's not.
We can't adopt Ana's baby because we feel guilty.
I don't mind talking about this some more with you, I don't.
But what I do mind
is not knowing what you're thinking or feeling
and hearing about it from another person outside this family,
before you share it with me.
We have to tell each other everything.
We're in all of this together.
Timothy... what are you doing here?
Well, I had a very nice talk with our new principal last night.
Turns out she's not a dilettante after all.
I just found out we have a new, old English teacher.
What can I say, your daughter made a very convincing argument.
Maybe she should be the lawyer.
I don't think it hasn't crossed her minds.
Thank you. Thank you.
Do you want to have lunch today?
Love to.
Great, let's do that.
OK.
So, um, there's something I wanted to tell you, um...
I pulled a muscle in my leg.
Oh my God, really?
Yeah, I can barely walk.
Oh, my God.
I don't know if I can dance.
Oh my God.
Yeah. I mean I can try...
No! You don't want to really risk hurting yourself.
I'm so sorry.
Don't be.
I mean, I'm really disappointed.
So am I.
I really wanted you to be on the team.
I really wanted to be on the team.
What are you going to do, you need six dancers.
There's got to be someone I can find to replace you.
I mean, it's not gonna be easy.
Yeah, because I'm such an amazing dancer.
Are you sure?
I'm positive. Trust me.
OK. I didn't actually hurt my leg.
Duh. You can always be honest with me, you know.
Yeah? Well, honestly, never do that sexy face again.
You mean, this one.
Yeah, no, it freaks me out!
'Cause you know you want me.
Stop it! You're gross.
So you can go on the tour.
Yes.
But I want to go to Idyllwild, if I can get in.
Classical music has been everything...
...and...
...I'm not ready to give up on it.
Without at least trying to be what I was.
I didn't know you were coming by.
Well, we wanted to tell Ana, in person.
Tell her what?
That we're adopting the baby.
Hey, uh, Mariana?
Will you shut the door?
Sounds serious.
I... saw Ana at my dad's.
Moms aren't gonna take her baby.
Did she tell you that?
No, I don't think she knows yet.
Or maybe she does.
How do you know?
I just know.
But please act surprised when they tell you.
I don't understand. They wanted a baby.
Not Ana's baby.
Even if she's your sister.
They don't know anything about who the father is
and they're still grieving Frankie.
You can't take this personally, OK?
The reason I'm telling you this is because Ana was really upset.
I guess she's been sending letters to her parents,
trying to make amends,
but they keep returning them, unopened.
Do you remember, them? Your grandparents?
No, I don't... I don't think we ever met them.
Well, I was thinking, since Moms aren't taking the baby,
that if her parents knew that Ana was pregnant,
maybe they would take it?
And that way, at least she's being raised by her grandmother
and you can get to know her.
Be a part of her life.
They live pretty close.
Yeah.
I thought if you'd want to write to them
you'd have their address.
Maybe he's not coming.
Maybe he got caught sneaking out.
There he is. You made it.
Who's house is this anyway?
Our friend, Brooklyn.
It's her birthday tomorrow.
And she hates her parents. Best present ever.
There it goes.
I got it!

Ready to string the place?
Ooh, yeah.
Ready?
Yeah.
Lights! Go!
Come on! Hurry! Go! Go!
Hey, love.
What're you doing?
You had Robert investigated?
When?
When we... When we first found out about him.
And this is why he was so willing to give Callie more time?
Because he's having an affair and you blackmailed him?
I used it, yeah.
"The ends justify the means?"
I did what I had to do to protect our daughter, Lena,
and I'm not going to apologize for it.
So much for being in this together.
Where'd they go?
Who knows. Maybe they're having sex.
They're having sex?
Not yet, but Daria's dying to lose her virginity.
At least that's what she told me.
Sorry. I...
It's OK.
It's just that...
It's cool. It's cool.
You have a crush on Connor.
I should go home.
Wait, weren't we gonna...?
We're not.
Come on, my dad's got tons of booze.
Let's break in and steal some.
You can't break in to your own house.
He thinks I'm spending the night at your house.
So, it's kinda breaking in.
Except you have a key.
Why you gotta take the fun outta everything?
Come on, let's all get drunk and make-out.
Come on. Let's do it.
Don't worry, my dad sleeps like the dead.
What about your mom?
She's actually dead.
Kidding. She's at a yoga retreat.
The bar's in here.
This is a bad idea.
Let's get some beer.
Don't!
Connor, come here.
Who's there?!
It's my dad. Go! Go! Go!
Hello.
