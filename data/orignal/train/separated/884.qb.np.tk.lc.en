growing up , my brother fancied himself quite the ladies &apos; man .
unfortunately , the only lady who was into him
was this lady .
i know i &apos;m your mother ,
but i think i can say this without bias .
uh , you are an adonis cut from marble
sent from heaven to be scrumptious .
oh , you got some schmutz .
truth is ,
barry had absolutely no game in the woman department .
guess who &apos;s gonna be a professional bmx biker .
guess who doesn &apos;t care .
okay , then .
yep -- no game whatsoever .
* big tasty wants to take you on a boat ride *
* i know it &apos;s not good timing &apos; cause your cat died *
especially when it came to erica &apos;s best friend , lainey .
she was the girl he pined after since first grade .
unfortunately , it wasn &apos;t reciprocated .
yep -- my brother was a lost cause ...
or so we thought .
&quot; general hospital &apos;s &quot; on . get out .
can &apos;t . i &apos;m busy .
doing what -- sitting down here alone , like a weirdo ?
sometimes i just like to light a candle
and sit with my thoughts .
erica , wait !
lainey ? !
hey .
just looking for my scrunchie . guess it &apos;s not down there .
it &apos;s in your hair .
oh ! so it is .
it &apos;s always the last place you look .
okay , bye @-@ bye now .
no , come back !
hold it right there !
are you and barry ... together ?
no . not really .
i mean , kinda .
he repulses me , but i &apos;m still drawn to him .
ew !
i know !
h @-@ he &apos;s clumsy and annoying
and has those big , brown eyes and cute dimples when he smiles .
ew !
i know !
lainey , we &apos;re talking about my brother .
this has to stop !
i know !
ew !
i &apos;ve tried , but i keep getting pulled back in .
it &apos;s like he annoys me so much ,
i just want to kiss his stupid face .
ew !
i know !
ladies .
can i interest either of you in an orange crush on ice ?
ew !
you !
me .
gotta go .
you cannot date my best friend .
it &apos;s an unholy union ! i forbid it !
please do .
forbidden love is the best kind of love --
right after tender and jungle .
you &apos;re delusional .
your relationship &apos;s not even real .
why do you think she &apos;s keeping it a secret ?
oh , we &apos;ll see how much of a secret it is after lainey asks me
to the darryl dawkins dance this friday .
darryl dawkins ?
do you mean sadie hawkins ?
no ! i &apos;m talking about the dance when the girls ask the guys .
it &apos;s named after the basketball player darryl dawkins .
who ?
dr. dunkenstein , the rim wrecker ,
chocolate thunder ,
don &apos;t fake the funk on a nasty dunk .
why would a dance where the girls ask the guys
be named after a basketball player ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s like the ball &apos;s in your court , girl .
that actually makes a tiny bit of sense .
but lainey &apos;s not asking you .
oh , she will .
and we &apos;ll dance , and we &apos;ll drink punch ,
and we &apos;ll fall in love , and we &apos;ll get married .
stop talking .
keep talking . who &apos;s getting married ?
i heard &quot; married , &quot; and i came running .
no one .
well , just so you know ,
i &apos;ve picked out the perfect person for each of my children ,
so whenever you &apos;re ready ,
i can introduce you to your soul mate .
pass !
come on .
don &apos;t you want what your father and i have ?
bevy !
i dropped your toothbrush in the toilet again .
did you do the right thing and toss it ,
or did you put it back in the holder ?
the right thing .
soul mates .
it was saturday morning , 1980 @-@ something ,
and that meant one thing -- cartoons .
children across america would park themselves on the couch
and be sucked into endless hours of their favorite shows .
there was &quot; g.i. joe , &quot; &quot; dinosaucers , &quot;
&quot; the real ghostbusters , &quot;
and the greatest one of all -- &quot; transformers . &quot;
so , they &apos;re robots ... but they &apos;re also cars ?
and trucks and planes and sometimes dinosaurs .
why would you ruin a perfectly good fiero
by turning it into some dumb robot ?
dumb ? ! it &apos;s the world &apos;s greatest cartoon .
they just came out with an animated movie .
they took this and made it longer ?
i don &apos;t get it .
oh , but a grown man hitting a ball with a stick --
that makes sense ?
don &apos;t you come after baseball .
it &apos;s america &apos;s pastime .
and robots are america &apos;s future !
deal with it !
deal with what ? robots aren &apos;t even real .
oh , you &apos;ll see how real they are when cyborgs take over
and outlaw your precious baseball .
never . and you know why ?
because we will rise up with our bats
and destroy those metal bastards .
a bat against a plasma cannon ?
good luck mining steel for your robot overlords .
okay , this has gotten away from us .
i &apos;ll take him to the talking @-@ car movie .
you do what you do .
pops could care less about my silly cartoon ,
but my best friend
would pretend to love anything for me .
this ... is amazing .
what &apos;s happening ?
that &apos;s the autobots .
those robots are the good guys .
oh ! watch this . they &apos;re about to kick decepticon butt .
but they didn &apos;t .
instead , they did this --
they killed one of the good guys .
no .
actually , they killed all the good guys .
no !
even optimus prime was killed in cold blood --
and along with it , my innocence .
do the good guys always die like this ?
they &apos;re not dead .
i @-@ it &apos;s probably a plot twist .
they &apos;ll come back and save the day .
but they didn &apos;t .
you ready to go ?
no .
optimus will be back .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s coming back .
oh , he &apos;s coming back --
bigger and better and not dead .
he &apos;s dead , dude .
while i was feeling down , barry was trying to get down .
&apos;sup , hot lips ?
you know the rules .
we only talk through the locker .
&apos;sup , hot lips ?
what do you want ? people are looking .
i was wondering when exactly
you were gonna ask me to the dance .
yeah , never . &apos; cause then people would see us together .
you know , it kind of sounds like
you don &apos;t want to be seen with me in public .
it sounds like that &apos; cause that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m saying .
aw , come on .
don &apos;t give me those puppy @-@ dog eyes through the locker .
you know i can &apos;t say no to those baby browns .
okay , fine !
just go stag , and i &apos;ll dance adjacent to you
without acknowledging your presence .
but ... i was gonna bring my cardboard
so i can break @-@ dance for you , baby .
i &apos;m sorry .
now go away .
erica saw that longing look in lainey &apos;s eye
and knew there was only one thing to do --
stop it .
mom , i need you to get heavily involved with your son
in an inappropriate way .
i &apos;m in . you name it , i &apos;ll do it .
it &apos;s barry .
he &apos;s in a serious funk
because nobody &apos;s asked him to the sadie hawkins dance .
well , when you &apos;re that delicious ,
it can be intimidating .
that &apos;s a theory .
anyway , i think that he &apos;s ready
to meet that soul mate you had picked out for him .
oh , my god ! it &apos;s finally happening !
my children are coming to me to help them find love !
i have literally found him
the most perfect , beautiful girl in the world .
great . - now , when you &apos;re looking --
no , let &apos;s just do this already .
are you sure about this ?
i mean , barry did specifically say
he didn &apos;t want me to set him up .
you have to .
this is not me being selfish or having my own agenda .
it &apos;s coming from a place of love ,
because i just want barry to be happy .
me sideways .
i have raised some thoughtful children .
come here .
stand up straight .
there it is .
i mean , who murders optimus prime ?
that &apos;s like killing superman or knight rider or lassie .
you &apos;ve been ranting about this for two days , kiddo .
come on . he &apos;s just a cartoon robot .
to you . to me , he &apos;s a hero .
if i made that movie , optimus would live forever ,
and he would bring peace to cybertron !
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about ,
but sure -- let &apos;s make that movie .
we &apos;ll right the wrongs of those hollywood bastards .
well , if we do this , we do it right .
i &apos;m talking top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line costumes , set design ,
romance , big @-@ budget stuntwork .
i got $ 75 in my wallet .
done .
what the hell are you doing ? that &apos;s my chair !
now it &apos;s optimus prime &apos;s command center .
i &apos;m making an awesome movie .
for how long ?
we &apos;re thinking five , six months .
what ? !
i know -- it &apos;s gonna be tough
with the late @-@ night shooting , the crew taking over the house ,
and the huge water bill .
i got to flood the basement .
oh , yeah ? well , use somebody else &apos;s chair .
stop !
you don &apos;t understand .
optimus was murdered in cold blood .
the greek exchange student staying with the applebaums ? !
no . that kid &apos;s name is niko .
i &apos;m talking about the robot i like from the cartoon .
so ?
so he &apos;s gone ,
and if it can happen to him , it can happen to anyone .
oh . i see what &apos;s happening .
we need to have the death talk .
eh -- i @-@ i &apos;m fine . we don &apos;t need to talk .
i just think death sucks and it shouldn &apos;t happen ,
and i &apos;m gonna undo it .
yeah , i know it &apos;s scary , but we all got to go sometime .
you got nothing to worry about .
you got your whole life ahead of you .
really ?
yeah .
now , if you were an old man , different story .
all right . good talk .
but it wasn &apos;t a good talk .
now i was worrying about my other hero -- pops .
okay , time for my big battle scene .
optimo gets run over and lives .
aaaaaaand ... hit me with the car .
a @-@ about that -- there were some rewrites .
in the new scene , optimus prime eats a fiber @-@ rich breakfast
and goes for a heart @-@ smart walk .
okay , i &apos;m not understanding my character here .
you told me i was a badass .
you are .
and after this scene ,
you &apos;re gonna rest up with some hot tea under an afghan ,
like a badass .
feels like you &apos;re taking the teeth out of this thing .
well , i &apos;m the director , and this is my vision .
now , take a calcium supplement
and stand on your mark in the shade .
oh , stop .
just tap me . tap me with the car .
you &apos;re old . it would shatter your whole body .
i &apos;ll show you old .
hit me with the car .
no !
you get in that car and you run me over right now .
forget it ! you &apos;re too difficult to work with ! you &apos;re fired !
you can &apos;t fire me ! i &apos;m the star !
i fire you !
you can &apos;t fire me ! i brought you onto this project !
well , i &apos;m pulling the funding , &apos; cause i &apos;m very upset --
even though i &apos;m not quite clear what we &apos;re arguing about .
and i &apos;m walking like this because of the costume ,
not because i &apos;m old .
barry still might not have had a date
for the darryl dawkins dance ,
but thanks to erica &apos;s scheme , he was about to get one .
love bug , i just got off the phone .
what &apos;s the best news you could think of ?
i &apos;m gonna be on a wheaties box with pete rose .
close .
i found a wonderful girl ,
and she wants to ask you to the sadie hawkins dance .
i honestly have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
she means &quot; darryl dawkins . &quot;
yeah , forget it . i hate that stupid dance .
barry , you should listen to her .
mom &apos;s the best matchmaker in town , okay ?
she set me up with a ton of great people .
really ? who ?
you know , like , uh ...
mondragor mccalister .
mondragor mccalister ? who &apos;s that ?
well ... he &apos;s ...
stop talking into your soda can !
barry , trust your mother .
i found the girl of your dreams .
she &apos;s smart , she &apos;s pretty ,
and she &apos;s waiting in the kitchen .
what is she doing ? !
i already met the girl of my dreams -- lainey .
she said she might dance adjacent to me .
dude , if you knew what &quot; adjacent &quot; meant ,
you would not be okay with that .
here she is .
this is evelyn silver .
i know her mother from my scrapbooking circle .
i scrapbook , too , but i &apos;m nothing compared to bevy .
she &apos;s the one who bought me
my first pair of scalloping scissors .
your mom is my arts @-@ and @-@ crafts guru .
i mean , i would have never thought
to cut my pictures into fun shapes ,
like hearts and stars .
squares are for squares .
even weirder than barry dating erica &apos;s best friend
was barry dating our mother .
wait , wait . i know you .
you &apos;re the girl at school
who always argues with the teachers .
only when they &apos;re wrong .
which is a lot .
oh , dear god .
i like your sweater . i find it oddly comforting .
thank you .
you got some schmutz on the side of ...
this is so , so creepy .
listen , your mom was thinking
maybe we could go to the dance together .
oh , i don &apos;t know what --
so you already have a date ?
not really .
well , you do now .
i &apos;m wearing pink , so keep that in mind
when you &apos;re buying my corsage .
no carnations . don &apos;t cheap out .
bevy ! where are my comfortable loafers ?
did you check by the front door ?
who are you ?
i &apos;m evy . you just called for me .
no , i said &quot; bevy . &quot;
they &apos;re by the front door .
well . sorry .
and thank you .
is that your hubby ?
yeah .
what a catch .
oh , dear god .
what are you doing ?
signing up for skydiving lessons .
i &apos;ll show him who &apos;s old .
okay .
i just got into a fight with adam .
you just got into a fight with adam ? over what ?
he wouldn &apos;t run me over with the car !
okay .
i mean , all of a sudden ,
he &apos;s treating me like some fragile old fogey .
this might partially be my fault .
i may have said something
along the lines of &quot; old people die , &quot;
and he may have jumped to conclusions .
what conclusions ?
you know , if you &apos;re at the deli counter of life
and you &apos;ve got your ticket ,
you &apos;re gonna get your sandwich sooner than other people will .
what is this horrible deli ? i hate this deli .
we all got to eat there sometime .
well , i &apos;m just gonna have a pickle .
can &apos;t just have a pickle .
i can , and i will .
you can &apos;t just have a pickle .
i &apos;m in better shape than you .
check out these guns !
why are you yelling at me ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s your fault !
you &apos;re the old guy wearing the costume of the dead robot he loves .
you &apos;re right .
the poor kid .
he &apos;s probably scared of losing his two greatest heroes .
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s a couple of other heroes on that list --
like me , for example .
okay .
evelyn silver ?
how could you go to the dance with evelyn silver ?
&apos;cause she asked me !
well , she kind of told me .
she &apos;s pushy in a way that feels familiar and safe .
well , now we &apos;re never not going to the dance together .
but ... we never were going to the dance together .
but now we &apos;re really never not going to the dance together .
okay , i am totally lost here .
i used to not want to be seen with you in public ,
but now i don &apos;t want to be seen with you in private , either .
but if we were in private , how could anyone see us ?
they wouldn &apos;t not see us ,
but now they &apos;ll never not see us !
i think my brain is about to explode !
see if you understand this -- i &apos;m dumping you .
we were together ?
we were together !
wait ! come back !
we were together .
pops gave me some time
to cool down from our big blowup .
unfortunately , i was hotter than ever .
hey , kiddo .
can we talk ?
busy . i &apos;m making a new movie .
stop @-@ motion animation -- you know what &apos;s good about that ?
no actors .
well , you look like crap . have you slept ?
no , i haven &apos;t slept . i &apos;m making a masterpiece here .
okay , look .
i know your dad talked to you about the deli of life ,
but you need to know --
i &apos;m not eating a sandwich just yet .
maybe it &apos;s because i &apos;m super @-@ tired ,
but you &apos;re making no sense .
look , everyone has their time .
but i &apos;m here , i &apos;m awesome ,
and i &apos;m not going anywhere anytime soon , kiddo .
really ?
really .
want to know my secret ?
hanging out with my best friend keeps me young .
now ...
what do you say you run your grandpa over with a car ?
i &apos;d love to .
hey . aren &apos;t you supposed to be getting ready for the dance ?
what &apos;s the point ?
i found love , and i lost it .
now i &apos;m never gonna talk through a locker
with someone i really care about again .
well , evy seems creepily into you .
but lainey was cool and made me feel alive ,
and i pretty much had a crush on her for my entire life .
but , like you said , she doesn &apos;t like me .
look , i know my best friend .
lainey likes you .
she just treats you like an annoying , twerpy loser
because you let her .
doesn &apos;t matter now .
i ruined everything .
no , i did .
mom didn &apos;t just randomly set you up on a date .
i ... may have put her up to it
because i didn &apos;t want you frenching on my best friend .
what ? !
i know it was wrong , but now --
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying this --
you should be at the dance with her .
ew .
hey . we need talk .
uh ... i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t know you .
just hear me out !
no ! leave me alone !
lainey !
lainey !
lainey , wait !
wait ! wait .
okay , i know i &apos;m irritating and i sweat a lot
and my rap flow is too ahead of its time ,
so i get why you don &apos;t want to be seen with me .
but i just need to know one thing --
do ... you ... like me ?
i do . please don &apos;t tell anyone .
i won &apos;t !
but it &apos;s come to my attention
you only treat me this way because i put up with it .
but i &apos;m here to tell you ...
i want to put up with it .
let me stand in the shadows .
let me only talk to you through your locker vent .
let me be your secret shame .
god , you &apos;re annoying .
i know .
come on . let &apos;s dance .
we can still hear the music out here .
no .
let &apos;s go inside .
then everyone will see us .
that &apos;s the point , dummy .
yep , barry goldberg was on top of the world ,
and no one could ruin that --
not even beverly goldberg .
what the hell is this ? !
i set barry up with his soul mate ,
and he &apos;s not even with her when i show up completely unannounced ?
yeah , about that -- why are you here ?
i came to see the lovebirds ,
but those are the wrong lovebirds !
yeah ... but maybe not .
he does look happy .
he really does .
wait . what happened to evy ?
oh , i took care of that .
turns out matchmaking runs in the family .
damn it . this is my only good tie .
oh , honey , that &apos;s okay .
don &apos;t touch it . rub it out with club soda .
be good as new .
that &apos;s the thing about growing up --
there &apos;s those perfect moments where life just surprises you .
for barry , that moment was now .
and for me , i felt that moment
every time i was with my grandfather .
that &apos;s the end of you , optimus .
i literally cannot die !
he was more than my hero .
he was my best friend .
so , what &apos;d you think , kiddo ?
i love it .
变形金刚
optimus ! no
we gather here today to witness the burial of optimus prime .
later that night ...
there &apos;s no optimus ! he &apos;s gone !
take the wave from me .
what ? no . i don &apos;t want the wave .
come on ! take it !
stop it ! i don &apos;t want it !
no wave .
what the hell ?
i &apos;ve been waiting in the car 10 minutes .
just watching barry . he &apos;s quite the dancer .
looks like a moron to me .
you can say that again .
evy , i &apos;m gonna go sit
in the comfortable chairs over there .
sitting ? that sounds good .
okay , yeah , i see it now .
