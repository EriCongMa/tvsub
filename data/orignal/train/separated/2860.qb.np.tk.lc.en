joey , wait a minute . wait.what is with you ?
nothing.you &apos;re acting strange .
all right . there is something.i kind of had a dream .
but i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
what if martin luther king had said that ?
i kind of have a dream.i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
look , it involved monica .
you had a dream about the girl i &apos;m seeing ? cool.i dreamt about the girls he was seeing .
let &apos;s talk about your dream . i love you . your dream ?
there was no sex . i haven &apos;t dreamt of her like that ...
... since i found out about you two . more or less .
what was the dream about ?
you were my girlfriend .
we were doing the crossword puzzle.like you did last night .
that &apos;s it . i &apos;m in love with monica . i &apos;ll move out .
joey , come on . that doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re in love with me .
it doesn &apos;t ? it could mean anything . like ...
... you &apos;re jealous that i &apos;ve become the apartment stud .
sounds like your dream .
or it could mean you saw chandler and me being close and stuff ... and you want that too .
in the dream i did enjoy the closeness .
if that &apos;s what it was , that &apos;d be great . i wouldn &apos;t have to move .
are you attracted to monica ? right here , right now , are you attracted to her ?
not really .
there you have it !
well , sure ! i &apos;m just wearing sweats !
but that &apos;s good ! you &apos;re not in love with me . you just want a girlfriend .
it &apos;s not just about getting a girlfriend .
i could get a girlfriend . we could sit and do crossword puzzles .
but could we have the closeness like you have ?
monica and i were friends before we dated . maybe that &apos;s it .
friends first ? that &apos;s interesting .
you become friends after ?
no , never done that either .
do you guys have a tape measure ? yeah . it &apos;s actually in my bedroom .
that &apos;s right .
what &apos;s up , joey ?
how you doing ?
excuse me . is this your car ?
don &apos;t park here . you &apos;re blocking the entrance .
don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s not a problem .
it &apos;s a problem for me , so it &apos;s a problem for you , because i &apos;m a cop .
so am l .
oh no
okay . so you &apos;re a cop . you can park anywhere.i know , because i &apos;m a cop too .
keep up the good work . 10 @-@ 4 .
wait . so , what precinct are you with ?
i &apos;m with the 57th.-i know a guy in homicide up there .
i &apos;m in vice .
in fact , i &apos;m undercover right now . i &apos;m a whore .
who else is in vice there ?
do you know ... sipowicz ?
sipowicz ? i don &apos;t think so .
yeah . sipowicz . yeah . big guy , kind of bald .
i don &apos;t know him .
don &apos;t try to call him . he &apos;s not there . he &apos;s out .
his partner just died .
tell sipowicz i &apos;m real sorry for his loss.i sure will . take care .
by the way ,
i &apos;m sure sipowicz will be all right . i heard that kid from silver spoons is really good .
where &apos;d you find my badge ?
could you give me and ross a hand moving his couch ?
i &apos;d love to , but i got acting class .
but you know what ? i guess i could blow that off . for you .
let me ask you something .
i was talking with monica and chandler.boy , they are really tight .
i know.that &apos;s not a bad situation they got there .
think i &apos;ll get me one of those .
what &apos;s up , joe ?
i think monica and chandler are so great ... because they were friends first .
so i asked myself , who are my friends ? you and phoebe .
i saw you first , so ....
what are you saying ?
maybe you and i crank it up a notch .
you know , honey ... as flattered as i am that you saw me first
... i just don &apos;t think we should be cranking anything up .
i &apos;ll treat you real nice .
yeah . well , you know ....
i think it &apos;s a great idea to become friends with someone before you date .
but the way you do it is you meet someone , become their friend ...
... build a foundation , then ask them out on a date .
don &apos;t hit on your existing friends .
won &apos;t that take longer ?
oh , but once you find it ... it &apos;s so worth the wait .
i understand .
man , i wish i saw phoebe first .
come here to me .
no , no . you come here to me .
i brought reinforcements .
great ! you brought joey ? the next best thing .
you brought chandler ? the next best thing would be monica !
i would be offended , but monica is freakishly strong , so ....
i drew a sketch of how we &apos;ll do it .
rach , that &apos;s you.that &apos;s the couch .
what &apos;s that ? that &apos;s me .
certainly think a lot of yourself .
no . that &apos;s my arm .
i see . i thought you just really , really liked your new couch .
just follow my lead .
come on , chandler .
all right . -okay.here we go .
all right . ready ?
turn ! turn ! turn !
i don &apos;t think we can turn any more !
i don &apos;t think it &apos;ll fit ! yeah , it will . come on ! up , up , up !
up ! yes ! here we go ! pivot !
pivot !
pivot ! pivot !
pivot ! pivot !
shut up ! shut up ! shut up !
i don &apos;t think it &apos;ll pivot any more.you think ?
all right , let &apos;s bring it back down and try again .
i think it &apos;s really stuck now .
i can &apos;t believe that didn &apos;t work .
i know . me neither.i mean , you had a sketch .
what did you mean when you said &quot; pivot &quot; ?
man , i cannot figure this out .
yeah , because it &apos;s not 1985 .
you guys , guess what ? i ditched a cop .
what ? -what do you mean ?
he caught me using his badge and he tried to bust me.damn real cops !
how far did he chase you ?
well , he didn &apos;t really . he just picked up his badge and stood there .
maybe we &apos;ll see you on world &apos;s most boring police chases .
why did you run ?
i had to .
you know , impersonating a cop is like a class e felony.two to four years minimum . i am not going back to that hellhole .
if i can just get it to pivot ... we &apos;ll be back on track .
rach , can i get some help please ?
yeah .
turn it off ! turn it off !
maybe the firemen can help us move the couch when they get here .
wait , wait , wait . -it &apos;s a new couch ! it &apos;s a new couch !
how &apos;s it going ? make any new friends ?
yeah . i met this woman .
what &apos;s she like ?
well , she &apos;s ... really good in bed .
you were going to be friends first .
hey , it &apos;s all your fault.why ?
you didn &apos;t give me advice . you gave me a pickup line .
i told her i wanted to build a foundation and be friends first .
suddenly , through no fault of my own , i became irresistible to her !
and her roommate .
what about the closeness ?
closeness , schmosness . there was three of us , for crying out loud !
who wants pizza ? i do ! i do ! i do !
this is great ! can you believe i found it on the second floor ?
who is it ?
n.y.p.d.
oh , my god ! just a minute , officer !
i &apos;m looking for phoebe buffay .
my god , it &apos;s him ! it &apos;s that cop ! -i can &apos;t believe he found me !
are you gonna go to jail ?
if i go down , you guys go down with me .
harboring a fugitive ? that &apos;s one to three years minimum .
good luck , chandler .
arrest me , but you &apos;ll never make it stick and you know it .
i have no choice , it &apos;s my job . you understand , right ?
and you understand that i &apos;m calling my lawyer .
and once he puts you on the stand , he &apos;ll make you look like a fool !
i don &apos;t like looking foolish .
maybe i don &apos;t arrest you today . maybe i came by and you weren &apos;t here .
i &apos;d love it if i weren &apos;t here !
since you &apos;re not going to jail tonight , i was wondering if you &apos;d ... iike to go to dinner with me ?
me ? yes
ever since you flashed my badge i can &apos;t stop thinking about you .
you &apos;re the prettiest fake undercover whore i &apos;ve ever seen .
nice .
i didn &apos;t see that coming . you &apos;re asking me out .
i could &apos;ve done it better , but these people keep staring at me .
i &apos;d like to go out with you , officer .
gary .
gary .
okay , so it &apos;s a date .
i gotta ask you , though . how &apos;d you find me ?
i ran your fingerprints through the computer .
this was listed as your last known address .
impressive.not as impressive as you .
your record shows you &apos;ve done some weird stuff .
we &apos;ll talk at dinner .
so i &apos;ll come by and pick you up ?
i can &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t worry , i won &apos;t just take you out for doughnuts .
he has a gun !
i &apos;d like to return this couch . i &apos;m not satisfied with it .
you wanna return this couch ?
it &apos;s cut in half .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m telling you .
did you cut this couch in half ?
it &apos;s crazy , it is cut in half .
i don &apos;t understand .
this couch is cut in half.i would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half .
we can &apos;t accept it in this condition .
well , i can &apos;t accept it in this condition .
you &apos;re saying this couch was delivered to you like this ?
look , i &apos;m a reasonable man.i will accept store credit .
i &apos;ll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars .
