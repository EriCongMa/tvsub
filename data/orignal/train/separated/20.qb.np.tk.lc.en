and hour ago i resigned
as state &apos;s attorney of cook county .
i want to be clear ... i have never abused my office .
at the same time , i need to atone for my personal failings
with my wife alicia and our two children .
just wanted to say thank you for the opportunity .
it &apos;s a real lifesaver .
no , glad you could come aboard .
i &apos;m cary , the other new associate .
oh , right .
kalinda sharma .
i &apos;m the in @-@ house .
oh , the investigator .
you &apos;re peter florrick &apos;s wife .
that &apos;s right .
she &apos;s a junior associate who doesn &apos;t think
she &apos;s a junior associate .
her husband was the states attorney .
she lived in highland park .
dad told us he made mistakes .
yeah , but not that .
brian thinks there &apos;s a good chance
the appellate court &apos;s going to listen to my case .
if they overturn it , everything goes back to normal .
peter , it &apos;s never going back to normal .
come on , guys , 15 minutes .
grace , come on , you got to eat .
and soccer tryouts are today .
mom , i hate this school .
why would i want to play for it ?
grandma &apos;s going to pick you up at the field around five @-@ ish .
i can &apos;t find my cleats anyway .
and you &apos;re telling me this now ?
they &apos;re probably still packed .
you can at least try and like it here .
just try .
hello .
this is a collect call
from tamms correctional institution from peter florrick
to decline this call press one .
to accept this call press two .
hey , peter .
hi . is this a good time ?
sure . are you all right ?
hanging in there .
the kids there ? can i talk to them ?
actually zach is in the shower
and grace just sat down to breakfast .
i tried to call earlier .
it &apos;s been a long line .
so ...
i guess we used to be more comfortable
with each other &apos;s silences , huh ?
i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s just we &apos;re really running late .
i &apos;ll let you go .
tell them i called , okay ?
okay , i will . bye .
bye .
found &apos; em .
we shouldn &apos;t have had to move .
the first year associate &apos;s primary job
is to clock billable hours .
and with most of those numbers down
in each of your departments ,
clearly some of you aren &apos;t doing yours .
now , that &apos;s not to say that you &apos;re all underperforming .
one of our newest associates clocked
225 hours last month alone .
but most of you can do better .
so while this meeting isn &apos;t about naming names ,
it is about asking you to step up .
and if you can &apos;t do that ,
at least sign a few new clients .
pardon the interruption ,
but someone &apos;s here to see mrs. florrick .
i believe it &apos;s her son .
i &apos;m so sorry . please excuse me .
kenny ?
kenny , is that ... is that you ?
mrs. florrick .
it &apos;s been awhile , huh ?
you &apos;re ...
grown .
are you parents with you ?
what are you ... what are you doing here ?
i think i need a lawyer .
last night ,
me and this guy brian
we went to my buddy &apos;s house to get , uh ...
we were just looking to party , you know .
to get what ?
some dank . weed or whatever .
anyway , right after we got there ,
this security guard rolls up and , um ...
and ?
i kind of freaked .
so i ran .
this morning when i went by brian &apos;s house ,
there were cops there .
i heard he got arrested .
what are you doing ?
what is this ?
i figure they &apos;re after me next .
i &apos;m not sure i understand what happened ,
but if you were buying pot ...
we weren &apos;t .
spencer was giving it to us .
the bottom line is , if you broke the law
you need to go to the police .
yeah , but ... i &apos;d still need a lawyer , right ?
don &apos;t move .
and get rid of that .
kalinda .
your kid &apos;s older than i thought .
oh , he &apos;s not mine .
listen , can i ask you a favor ?
will you find out
if there was any police activity
in highland park last night ?
and see if kenny chatham is a person of interest
or if there are any warrants out on him .
for ?
pot , possession , possibly buying .
so if he &apos;s not a relative ,
who is he ?
i knew his mom .
can i talk to you for a minute ?
everything okay with your son ?
actually , it wasn &apos;t zach .
he &apos;s a family friend who got into some trouble .
legal trouble ,
or &quot; my parents don &apos;t understand me &quot; trouble ?
i &apos;m not quite sure yet .
i was hoping if i could drive him home .
i know . i will make up the time .
thanks .
so did you not go to school today because of this ?
i haven &apos;t been going .
probably do the ged thing later .
what , you mean you dropped out ?
about six months ago .
you guys had already moved by then .
i remember you being way cooler than this .
oh , i &apos;m sorry to disappoint you .
and i don &apos;t get why you can &apos;t help me
without getting them involved .
it &apos;s out of respect , kenny .
you still live with them .
you and i owe them that much .
you don &apos;t owe them anything .
they blew you off .
that &apos;s who they are .
all right , you ready to do this ?
i was kind of hoping you &apos;d go in first .
you &apos;re lucky i remember what a cute kid you were .
mom .
mom , mom .
kenny honey , mommy &apos;s busy .
i &apos;m just saying ,
somebody else has to start hosting these things .
oh , please , you love doing this .
maybe . but i couldn &apos;t do it without you .
hi , lauren .
what are you ...
what are you doing ?
you look ... great .
you know , i &apos;ve been meaning to call ...
i &apos;m sorry to just show up like this ,
but i need to talk to you about kenny .
where is he ?
my car .
asked me to smooth the waters .
you didn &apos;t have to drive all the way out here .
you could &apos;ve called .
i could &apos;ve .
but a boy i saw grow up asked for my help .
and his mother used to be a friend .
you need to come outside .
hello ?
he is wanted by the police .
what ? who ?
kenny . but not for buying pot .
oh , my god !
where are you taking him ?
ow ! you &apos;re hurting me !
what &apos;s he being charged with ?
who the hell are you ?
his attorney .
felony murder .
are they saying kenny did this ?
yeap . along with brian keller .
the police allege that these two broke
into a guest apartment
owned by the rankin family .
they broke in ?
nothing was reported stolen ,
but the police have kenny and brian &apos;s fingerprints
on a window that was jammed open .
kenny said he was at a friend &apos;s .
yeah , that would be the rankin &apos;s 17 @-@ year @-@ old son , spencer .
he lives above the garage ,
but obviously wasn &apos;t home at the time .
and because the guard
was killed in the commission of an alleged burglary ,
it &apos;s felony murder .
yep . the police theorize
that the boys encountered a security guard as they were leaving ,
struggled with him ,
then shoved him down the stairs ,
where he hit his head on concrete .
he died at approximately 11 : 20 p.m.
according to the medical examiner .
kenny isn &apos;t capable of doing this .
well , how well do you know him ?
very .
his mother was my first friend in highland park .
oh , yeah ?
well , and the first person to stop talking to me .
you getting me out ?
not yet .
i just came by to see how you &apos;re doing .
i didn &apos;t know anybody died ,
i don &apos;t know how anybody could have .
we probably shouldn &apos;t talk in here .
like , i told you , i ran home .
i yelled up at brian to get out ,
but he couldn &apos;t hear me , he was still inside .
the police are saying ...
i never even saw the guard ,
just his car !
then why did you lie to me , kenny ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me you broke in ?
because we didn &apos;t .
okay .
look , there &apos;ll @-@ there &apos;ll be a bail hearing ,
and a judge will decide
if you can be released pending trial .
talk to spencer .
he &apos;s my friend .
he knew we were coming .
he said to take whatever we needed ,
he even told us where the spare key was--
we just ... we couldn &apos;t find it so we pushed a window open .
mrs. florrick ,
i swear ... i ran home when i saw the guard &apos;s car .
okay .
not the strongest case .
but she &apos;s signing a client .
and if his parents live in highland park ,
payment won &apos;t be an issue .
i don &apos;t know .
when the connections are personal , it can get tricky .
blurring the line between friendship
and business usually is .
um , actually ,
i don &apos;t have a relationship with his parents anymore ,
which is why i would prefer someone else
be the attorney of record .
i don &apos;t understand .
if you &apos;re no longer friends , why do this at all ?
because my relationship with his parents
has nothing to do with how i feel about their son .
i used to baby @-@ sit him .
i &apos;ll do all the briefs , all the legwork .
i would just feel more comfortable
if someone else tried the case .
so , you sign your first client ,
but you want a second associate
to be the face of the case .
give herself a bridge . i get that .
richard ,
you want to explain to me why the attorney
i hired for my son just got turned away ?
didn &apos;t lauren tell you ?
i was there ...
terry streiger .
and excuse me for saying so , mrs. florrick ,
but i think you &apos;re in over your head .
terry &apos;s been a defense attorney
for more than 20 years .
he &apos;s a top @-@ rated aba member ,
he &apos;s well @-@ known and well @-@ respected .
so , thank you for your time , but we &apos;ll take it from here .
okay ?
your son asked me to represent him .
without our consent ?
he doesn &apos;t need your consent , he &apos;s 18 .
and how do you think he &apos;s going to pay for it ?
i don &apos;t know .
we &apos;ll work something out .
and although i might not be as seasoned as mr. streiger is ,
i can guarantee you
i care a lot more about your son than he does .
kenny will get the best defense .
... with my buddies and i &apos;m bombed .
and my ex @-@ girlfriend , i hadn &apos;t seen her ...
what are you doing here ?
excuse me .
diane said you needed a first chair .
kenny , this is my associate , cary agos .
he &apos;s one of the best attorneys with the firm .
he &apos;ll be helping me with your defense .
good to meet you .
this should be pretty simple .
we get you out on bail and get you home .
court is now in session .
the honorable earl hovick presiding .
ms. raines . your honor ,
due to the seriousness of the charges ,
the state opposes bail at this time .
we believe the defendant
not only poses a flight risk but a danger to the community .
excuse me , your honor , but based on what ?
mr. chatham has no criminal history ,
close ties to the community ,
in fact , his parents are seated in the gallery here
to assure the court that their son will appear for trial .
begging your pardon , your honor ,
but the state has secured a cooperating witness ,
co @-@ defendant brian keller .
who not only places mr. chatham at the crime scene
but identifies him as the attacker .
then bail is denied .
defendant is remanded to custody .
next case .
you told me it was gonna be simple .
your friend brian must &apos;ve cut a deal with the state &apos;s attorney .
the first one who does is usually the first one out .
let &apos;s go .
i need to talk to you guys about something .
that sounds serious .
it is , actually .
is it about dad ?
oh , no , no , no , no , he &apos;s fine .
i just would rather you hear this from me .
kenny chatham got arrested .
for murder , right ?
yeah , and you &apos;re like one of his lawyers .
that &apos;s what janna told me .
yeah , shane im &apos;d me about it .
everyone &apos;s totally freaked .
uh , well , are there any questions you &apos;d like to ask me ?
or do you want to talk about any of it at all ?
not really .
been hearing about it all night as it is .
yeah , it &apos;s really all anybody back there is taking about .
i &apos;m sure .
and it must be pretty upsetting to you guys , too .
mom , we only ever saw kenny &apos; cause he was your friend &apos;s son .
we have our own friends back in highland park .
at least on facebook .
since we &apos;re not allowed to go back .
that &apos;s not true .
i &apos;m done . can i be excused ?
i guess .
me , too .
by the way , i didn &apos;t make the soccer team .
you &apos;re here early .
ah , but not the first .
that &apos;s what happens when you &apos;re single and childless .
i was going to leave you a note .
i wanted to see how things were going with him as first chair .
well , he &apos;s certainly confident .
look , this is your case .
diane assumed , rightly so ,
that you were just looking for a front man
to provide a little cushion
since you &apos;re dealing with friends .
former .
sounds complicated .
it is .
legally or emotionally ?
both .
we didn &apos;t get bail because brian
cut a deal with the s.a.
he got immunity on felony murder
by taking a lesser charge of burglary ,
and agreeing to testify against kenny .
so what we need to do is ...
establish there was no burglary .
so , i &apos;ll dig up what i can on this brian character .
yeah , and we &apos;ll question spencer rankin ,
hopefully get him to agree to testify for the defense , right ?
right .
these kids go to a fancy campus .
mom , i don &apos;t like it .
grace , this is the best school in the county .
you just give it some time .
i think you &apos;re gonna love it here .
reminds me of my old high school .
reminds me of the schools i used to vandalize .
spencer ?
my name is mrs. florrick .
we &apos;d like to talk to you about what happened at your apartment .
you guys are cops ?
no , we &apos;re just trying to help your friends .
hey , hey , hey , don &apos;t let mom make you nervous .
what &apos;s up , man ? i &apos;m cary . how you doing ?
look , that &apos;s a pretty sweet situation
you got by your folks &apos; garage , dude .
that &apos;s kind of like having your own place , huh ?
i don &apos;t know anything about what happened .
yeah , yeah , yeah , no , no , no , it &apos;s cool .
i get it , i guess , i don &apos;t i guess i &apos;m just envious .
&apos;cause i keep thinking about what i would &apos;ve done
if i &apos;d had a place like that .
you know , hell , what i would do now if i had a place like that .
i mean , i &apos;m sure
you and kenny had some seriously sick times up there , right ?
i guess . yeah .
they &apos;re not gonna happen anymore though ,
are they ? you know why ?
because the cops are saying kenny broke into your place .
and you know why they &apos;re saying that ?
because they don &apos;t get how good of a friend you are to him .
they don &apos;t get what you and he share .
they don &apos;t get you told him
it was okay to help himself to your weed that night .
yeah , and because of that
the ken @-@ ster &apos;s facing life in prison .
so , what do you need me to do ?
we tell the s.a. we got a witness corroborating permission
and we cut kenny &apos;s jail time by 10 years .
he shouldn &apos;t have to do any jail time .
without the burglary charge , he can &apos;t be held accountable
for what happened after he left a crime scene .
you &apos;re assuming a jury won &apos;t believe brian &apos;s version more .
kenny has no alibi .
his parents were asleep when he got home .
okay , so this brian , he &apos;s got a temper .
then we need to find a witness
who can place him at or near his home .
and if there aren &apos;t any ? it &apos;s too risky .
guidance counselor says
he &apos;s been suspended twice for fighting .
kenny , however , was always seen as a sweet kid
till he started hanging out with brian , that &apos;s it .
pretty toxic friendship .
don &apos;t you think we should at least
investigate the situation ?
timeline &apos;s too mushy for reasonable doubt .
if we go to court and he &apos;s found guilty ,
it &apos;s 20 to life .
we should be fighting for total exoneration .
he &apos;s innocent .
but can we prove it ?
bet the bus is already here .
yeah , well , maybe if you didn &apos;t hog the shower ...
just keep moving , guys .
mrs. chatham ?
oh , my god , look at both of you .
okay , guys , come on , let &apos;s get going .
did you want to come in ?
i heard you &apos;d moved .
wasn &apos;t easy tracking down an address .
it &apos;s a nice apartment .
lauren .
i just ...
i want to know what &apos;s happening with the case .
right now , we &apos;re looking for someone who can place kenny
at or near your house the night of the murder .
to prove he couldn &apos;t have done it .
i talked to richard .
we &apos;ll pay kenny &apos;s legal fees .
wasn &apos;t easy getting him to budge .
i &apos;m sure you remember how controlling he can be .
how are things between you ?
the same .
i go to get a drink , right , by the time i get back ,
alicia has the governor literally backed into a corner ,
nailing him on his lack of support for the arts .
i was just asking him to explain his position .
there she is .
what &apos;s a nice girl like you doing at a place
like the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office anyway ?
best place to practice law .
oh , i don &apos;t know about that .
life at a private firm has its perks .
i became an s.a. because
i like duking it out in court , not over lunch .
oh , that &apos;s too bad ,
because that &apos;s what i was about to suggest .
talked to my bosses .
we &apos;re on board with a plea bargain
in the chatham case .
really ?
yeah .
so , thai , italian
or should we just grab a couple of steaks ?
where &apos;s cary ?
shouldn &apos;t he be out here canvassing as well ?
well , he said he had to do something else .
there &apos;s plenty of street lighting .
clear shot from the house across the street .
maybe the one on the right , too .
in this neighborhood , kenny running home
after 11 : 00 would have definitely been noticed .
think they &apos;ve got enough manicured lawns here ?
grass can &apos;t be more than two inches tall .
neighborhood association wields a mighty sword .
pretty .
doesn &apos;t seem like a good fit though ... you living here .
was it ?
i did it for 10 years , i liked it at the time .
ignorance is bliss , i guess .
let &apos;s see what kenny &apos;s neighbors have to say ?
everyone &apos;s pretty shaken up .
i mean , this sort of thing just doesn &apos;t happen around here .
scandal maybe , but murder ?
were you on duty
when it happened ?
you tell me .
i work second shift , 2 : 00 to 11 : 00 pm .
not that i ever get out on time .
my relief &apos;s always late .
what time did you leave exactly ?
don &apos;t know off the top of my head ,
but i could check my time card .
got a copy of it somewhere .
and , shelly , when you were leaving ,
do you remember seeing anyone on the street ?
anyone running ?
not really .
i mean i think i saw someone go inside across the way .
you mean through the front door ?
yeah ,
because they turned the yard lights off right after ...
made it hard to fill out my timecard .
and was this person male or female ?
sorry , didn &apos;t get that good a look .
hello .
your husband &apos;s doing a fine job .
don &apos;t mind her .
she has dementia .
only remembers the past .
here it is .
11 : 25 . that help ?
you have no physical evidence
linking my client to the victim .
no dna , nothing .
even so ,
you can &apos;t prove he wasn &apos;t an accomplice to the burglary .
and if someone dies during the commission ,
it &apos;s felony murder regardless of who killed him .
yeah , except your witness , brian ,
made a deal-- by copping to burglary ,
he gets immunity from felony murder charges ,
which means he has incentive to lie .
fine .
second degree murder .
4 to 15 ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
we &apos;ll do involuntary manslaughter .
can i get some more , uh , water , please .
not going to happen .
can i try a fry ?
yeah , help yourself .
well , manslaughter ,
since burglary &apos;s not in play anymore .
what ?
uh , did i forget to mention
that we can prove kenny had permission to enter ?
spencer rankin &apos;s willing to testify .
so , as i was saying ...
a man &apos;s still dead .
i &apos;ll make a case to the judge
for a maximum sentence of five years .
make it two and we got a deal .
these rich kids really do get away with murder .
the crime scene is about
half a mile west of here .
security guard called into operations
at 11 : 15
to say he was doing a perimeter check .
he was dead by 11 : 20 .
the prosecution would argue
that kenny still had time to attack the guard
and get home on foot by 11 : 25 .
is that even possible ?
run that distance in five minutes ?
only one way to find out .
the average teenage boy sprinting would likely be
in the range of eight to ten miles per hour .
how do you even know that ?
would you believe me
if i told you i was a track coach in a previous life ?
no .
okay .
it &apos;s two minutes and we &apos;re ...
ass !
nice . nice .
you oughta try it sometime .
what , flipping someone off ?
it &apos;s good for your soul .
so , from kenny &apos;s house to spencer &apos;s ...
just under five minutes .
it &apos;s pretty tight ,
but the prosecution &apos;s right ...
it &apos;s doable .
in other words , the nurse &apos;s testimony
will only go so far .
yeah .
guess there &apos;s no chance the s.a.
will let us in without permission .
i don &apos;t exactly have a good relationship
with that department anymore .
you come within 100 feet of my son again ,
and i swear , i &apos;ll sue you ,
the chathams , and your entire firm .
spencer &apos;s got nothing to do with this and how dare you
intimidate him into giving false information .
there was never any permission given to enter ,
there was never any pot and he is
never going to testify !
i had the plea in my hand .
and i had no idea you went to the state &apos;s attorney .
i told you what the plan was .
but i never agreed to it , cary ,
and we never presented it ...
i cleared it through diane .
all right ?
and now we &apos;ve got nothing .
no , we have an eyewitness
who &apos;ll testify that at 11 : 19
she saw ...
a figure from a distance ?
and the s.a.
has an eyewitness who will positively identify kenny as the killer .
we don &apos;t have a case .
and they don &apos;t have conclusive physical evidence .
i gotta go .
i gotta prep for court .
you realize cary &apos;s never been to trial before .
how is that even possible ?
easy .
by pleading out every court case that comes your way .
this is a pretrial hearing
which is another way of saying
both sides should come to an agreement
before we go any farther .
i guess my parents aren &apos;t coming .
but since you haven &apos;t yet--
be advised there is no jury in this proceeding ,
there &apos;s just me .
and my determination
as to whether or not there &apos;s enough probable cause
to hold this defendant for a long , expensive trial .
they &apos;re probably on their way .
and because this is all about me ,
i get to ask questions , too .
particularly if our esteemed attorneys
don &apos;t ask the right ones .
ms. raines , you &apos;re up .
at 11 : 24 p.m. ,
brian was pulled over for speeding ,
approximately four blocks from the rankin house .
and officer diaz ,
did brian give any statement at that time ?
yes , he did .
he immediately confessed to having fled
the scene of a burglary on belson street .
so , in effect ,
he placed himself at the crime scene .
yes ,
and was arrested at that time .
in your experience ,
do spontaneous confessions such as this tend to be accurate ?
typically , the perpetrator won &apos;t have had enough time
to concoct a story , so , yes .
they usually are .
nothing further .
mr. agos .
officer diaz .
sorry , i need to refer back to my notes .
no mention of killing when arrested !
yeah , yeah , i know , i know i know .
there was no mention of killing when arrested .
sometime before i go gray , counsel .
officer diaz ,
when mr. keller had this &quot; spontaneous utterance , &quot;
did he mention that anyone had been killed ?
not until after we got to the station , no .
so , when brian told you that
kenny chatham was responsible for the victim &apos;s death ,
he had had time to concoct a story .
objection .
sustained .
if for no other reason than the use of pluperfect tense .
nothing further .
it gets easier as you go .
my interests have never been in litigation .
prosecution calls brian keller .
brian , tell us what happened that night .
kenny wanted to get high
and he said he knew where he could get some weed .
he never said anything about breaking in , though ,
which is why i was surprised
when he asked me to help jam the window open .
i mean , i did it , but ...
i was kinda freaked out afterward .
so i went downstairs .
and did what ?
to wait for him
so we could get the heck out of there .
but then i saw the security guard .
did he see you ?
no , i hid behind a bush .
right in there .
i know this is difficult , but could you
tell the judge what you saw ?
i can &apos;t believe he could lie like this .
people do it all the time .
um ... i saw the guard go up the stairs .
here ?
yeah and i guess he kinda surprised kenny
because they kinda got into it ,
and kenny sorta shoved him , and the guard fell backwards .
and he just ...
just stopped moving .
then kenny just took off .
what &apos;s the matter ?
nothing .
just manicured lawns .
so from where you were standing ,
you had a clear view of the crime .
yes .
no further questions .
that &apos;s plenty for today .
court &apos;s adjourned till 9 : 00 tomorrow .
heads up .
you guys want to go for a ride ?
where to ?
i don &apos;t know . see some old friends ?
hey , um , i gotta go .
i &apos;ll talk to you later , okay ?
mom ? highland park ?
didn &apos;t think anyone was still here .
just prepping for court .
by reading case law , huh ?
you &apos;re better off
watching experienced trial lawyers .
yeah , well , new kid on the block .
i don &apos;t get much opportunity to shadow seniors .
though i have learned a lot by watching alicia .
she &apos;s definitely got some serious skills .
we suspect it &apos;s a georgetown thing .
no doubt .
no doubt .
yeah , that &apos;s a long time to stay friends
since college and all .
so , it &apos;s really commendable ...
you championing her the way that you do .
yeah , know what &apos;s great about someone like alicia ?
she &apos;s a natural .
she doesn &apos;t have to try so hard .
have a good night .
would you like a drink ?
no , thanks .
where are your kids ?
i dropped them at their friends &apos; .
they really miss it here .
how bad ?
i noticed
you two weren &apos;t in court today .
i came by to give you an update .
lauren couldn &apos;t handle it .
she &apos;s not like you .
she &apos;s not that strong .
she &apos;s asleep now .
took a valium .
well , it must be hard on her ...
on both of you ...
to see your son like that .
but it &apos;s really important that at least one of you be there .
so , how did it go ?
to be honest , not great .
they have kenny &apos;s fingerprints at the scene ,
and someone who will testify that he pushed the guard .
you think he &apos;s guilty ?
no .
do you ?
i don &apos;t know who he is anymore .
did you have a good time ?
yeah , except i forgot how much of a whiner janna was .
i didn &apos;t .
like your friends aren &apos;t geeks .
can we go home now ?
i just have one more stop .
tell me you &apos;re not taking us to the crime scene .
seriously ?
awesome .
looks like no one &apos;s home .
stay here .
oh , my god .
what happened ?
i ran into the neighborhood association .
if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;d like
to review the sequence of events on the night in question .
you testified
that while kenny was upstairs , you waited down below .
is that correct ?
that &apos;s right .
and how long were you there
before the security guard arrived ?
i don &apos;t know .
a few minutes ?
according to patrol records ,
he called in a perimeter check at 11 : 15 .
do you know what time it was when you saw the guard ?
a few minutes after that , i guess ?
so , 11 : 18 ?
and how long were you there
after you saw the guard ?
couple minutes .
which puts us at 11 : 20 .
your honor , all this has been
established in a prior testimony .
right , right . my mistake .
brian ,
do you know exactly what time the defendant attacked the guard ?
like you just said , 11 : 20 or so .
and you left the rankin house when ?
it &apos;s already been stated that he was arrested at 11 : 24 .
so , it was just four minutes
between the time of the killing and the time of your arrest ?
yes .
now that you &apos;ve dazzled us
with your math skills , mr. agos ,
can we please move on ?
were you wet ?
what do you mean ?
the police report made no mention
of your being wet at the time of your arrest .
but were you ?
objection . what does the weather have to do with this ?
your honor , i &apos;d like to introduce the bylaws
of the highland park neighborhood association into evidence .
specifically , page four , paragraph two ,
regarding the watering of lawns ,
which is only allowed at night
in an effort to save water .
your honor !
for the record , the rankins
were in full obeyance with said bylaws .
their automatic sprinkler system
is set to go off every night at 11 : 15
and run for 15 minutes .
if you had been where you said you were ,
you would have gotten soaked .
the truth is ,
you weren &apos;t standing behind the bush .
you were standing over the guard .
objection !
nothing further .
that you pursue a charge with this magnitude
without a thorough investigation
is unconscionable .
your honor ...
no direct or circumstantial evidence
linking the defendant to the murder ,
no eyewitness testimony other than that of a co @-@ defendant
who has a vested interest in the outcome of the trial .
your honor , if you ...
ms. raines ,
i strongly suggest
you find a way to work with the defense counsel
to find a more equitable solution .
there &apos;s a place around the corner , serves deep dish by the slice .
i &apos;m gonna get some .
by my count , you got about 20 minutes .
breaking and entering ,
plus possession of marijuana .
trespassing and possession .
are you kidding me ?
look ,
you &apos;re all but guaranteed
of a manslaughter conviction against brian .
if you can &apos;t spin that into a win with the brass ,
you &apos;re in the wrong line of work .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcom .
you &apos;re quite the skilled negotiator .
hey , you did all the heavy lifting .
seriously . well done , alicia . well done .
thanks , cary .
no jail time .
thank you .
thank you so much .
that &apos;s great news . thank you . i appreciate it .
oh , our pleasure .
kenny just has to perform 1,000 hours of community service .
and participate in mandatory drug counseling .
i &apos;ll make sure of it .
so ... i can take you to the court clerk ,
see about getting kenny &apos;s personal effects back ,
if you like .
sure .
now that this is over , we should ...
i don &apos;t know , maybe have lunch .
pretend none of this ever happened .
i &apos;ll call you , okay ?
you &apos;re not going to call .
and we &apos;re not going to have lunch .
and that &apos;s okay .
it really is .
take care .
first plea bargain , a gin martini .
it &apos;s another stern , lockhart tradition .
thanks , but i think i just want to go home tonight .
i knew i wasn &apos;t the only one burning the midnight oil .
cary .
how are you ?
fine . thanks for asking .
working on sheffrin @-@ marks ?
we win this one , our firm &apos;s in a whole new league .
what &apos;s your excuse ?
sorry ?
for burning the midnight oil .
oh . same as yours .
just going over the landers depo docs for sheffrin .
billable hours .
anyway , i just wanted to update you
on the outcome of the chatham case .
turns out , i was able to push the s.a.
into a very favorable plea bargain .
excellent .
okay , well ...
you have a good night .
keep up the good work .
thanks .
i intend to .
is that your idea of a notch under your belt ?
you think the kids heard us ?
kids ?
maybe you .
oh , funny .
not too bad for an old married couple , huh ?
i love you .
i love you , too .
don &apos;t .
might be work .
peter florrick .
yeah .
okay .
hold on a second .
it &apos;s an office emergency .
be one minute .
one minute .
okay .
next up on news at 11 : 00 ...
a highland park teen is charged with manslaughter
in the killing of ...
hey . it &apos;s after 10 : 00 .
what are you doing up so late on a school night ?
just looking out at the view .
it &apos;s nice , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s a cool room .
smaller than my old one , though .
you know what i was thinking about today ?
how much you hated your old school
when you first started there .
yeah , i kind of did .
today , i &apos;m sort of glad we moved .
