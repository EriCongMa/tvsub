hey , i &apos;m gonna go to the bathroom real quick .
i want to look in the mirror
and make sure i &apos;m still dead in the eyes .
you think you can handle my section ?
uh , yeah , i think i can handle it .
hey , earl , i don &apos;t know if you noticed ,
but i &apos;m running the whole diner right now .
what , what ?
the customer at table ten appears to be choking ,
and i would help ,
but the last time i gave a white woman the heimlich ,
i did six months in the birmingham city jail .
oh , my god , are you choking ?
oh , my god , i feel like you &apos;re choking !
is anyone here a doctor ?
what am i saying ? i forgot where i am .
has anyone here ever seen scrubs ?
what do you do when a girl is choking ?
i just back up a few inches .
what do we do ?
what do we do ? this woman is choking !
thank you so much .
you &apos;re welcome .
and feel free to tip me what you think your life &apos;s worth .
i feel 3 bucks coming my way .
here you go , guys . i &apos;m the only waitress .
sorry you waited longer for the burger
than you did for that cosby sweater to come back .
max , look at my face . i &apos;m very upset .
is that what that means ? i just assumed you were constipated .
caroline is late again .
and she better not use your new cupcake shop as an excuse this time ,
&apos;cause sister , that crap ain &apos;t gonna fly .
first of all ,
stop talking like you &apos;re in a tyler perry movie .
and secondly ,
caroline &apos;s here ; she &apos;s in the kitchen .
oh , really ? &apos; cause when i was in there ,
you told me she was out here .
you play me , fool .
stop talking like you &apos;re in a tyler perry sequel .
and secondly--
i &apos;ll ask earl .
earl ...
ow !
what happened ? why did you scream ?
i accidentally sat on one of my boys !
have you seen caroline tonight ?
of course i have , man .
i just saw her go down the hall to the ladies room .
there . happy ?
you &apos;ve solved the big mystery , shortlock holmes .
wait , she didn &apos;t pick up any of her--
caroline ?
can &apos;t talk now , han .
and how many more times do i have to ask you
to fix this damn pie carousel ?
i mean , the temp just isn &apos;t cool enough ,
and those tapiocas are gonna turn bad .
if you do want a lawsuit , just keep ignoring me .
max , can i see you in the kitchen
where i was just a couple minutes ago
after i got out of the ladies room ?
yeah , get on that temperature thing .
there &apos;s so much mold growing in there
that cherry pie &apos;s gonna need a pap smear .
that was some ballsy , bold ,
in @-@ your @-@ face awesome lying .
i learned it by watching you , dad .
had to lie . we need every minute
we can steal away from here to get the cupcake shop ready .
we still have to do the second coat of paint ,
figure out tables and chairs ...
what ? didn &apos;t have time for lunch .
oh , i don &apos;t care .
i &apos;m surprised you &apos;re using a spoon .
i just stick my face in it .
so , my brilliant idea of how we get this all done
is we should get an intern to help .
what ? no .
i can &apos;t be a person that has an intern .
i can barely be a person that doesn &apos;t have an intern .
max , all businesses use interns .
we just have to post an ad online
at nyu or columbia ,
and we &apos;ll have 20 applicants battling it out
to do our grunt work for credit .
you make it sound like the hunger games : college edition .
sorry , i &apos;m against getting people to work for free .
i &apos;m with you , max .
my people were interns for 436 years .
i am just getting used to the idea of having my own business
and now you want me to be someone &apos;s boss ?
i am not the boss .
i &apos;m the person who talks behind the boss &apos;s back .
pick up .
thanks . isn &apos;t han a tool ?
total tool .
yeah , a tiny tool .
like the kind you fix your eyeglasses with .
see ?
that &apos;s my wheelhouse .
look , i don &apos;t want to ask someone to work for free .
we can do it all ourselves .
you want to do it all yourself ? great .
i &apos;ll write everything you need to do on a to @-@ do list .
why don &apos;t you to @-@ do that ?
and i will to @-@ tear it up .
what &apos;re we tearing up ?
&apos;cause if it &apos;s that ass , i already got that covered .
hi , andy . that &apos;s so sweet and dirty .
easy , easy . what are you , shipping off to war ?
here . take this giant bag of skittles
and look the other way .
i &apos;m not that easy .
ooh , new mystery flavors ?
we getting together after you get off work ?
it &apos;ll be really late .
max and i still have to go to the cupcake shop
and tape up the windows so we can start the trim tomorrow .
okay , i &apos;m not very good at painting ,
but i can do this while you paint .
yeah .
yeah , roll that paint on that wall .
you are so freaking cute .
ugh , white people .
look , why don &apos;t you guys just get an intern ?
that &apos;s what i did when i opened my shop .
you two are like evil warlords
mining the souls of innocent zombies .
oh , and keep your eyes peeled at your store .
the janitor told me he saw some rat droppings .
but all you gotta do is set up some traps .
oh , gross . who &apos;s gonna do that ?
the intern ?
so , ruth , you are a sophomore at nyu , majoring in finance ?
you know you &apos;re not gonna get paid .
no money at all .
yup , it &apos;s in internship .
i mean , it &apos;s all good , right ?
it &apos;s all good until you need money .
well , we &apos;re a startup company ,
and we &apos;re launching our very first retail store ,
so there &apos;s a lot of details that you &apos;ll be responsible for .
there &apos;s a lot of carrying things ,
maybe some trapping things .
oh , it &apos;s cool . i have a car .
you have a car and you want to be an intern ?
how &apos; bout if we switch places ?
i &apos;ll be the intern with the car ,
and you can sit on a broken folding chair
next to donna trump over here .
well , max and i need to have a little meeting right now ,
so if you could go over to the waiting room , that &apos;d be great .
okay , ruth ?
i just wanna say i know my name is weird ,
but like it &apos;s too late , right ?
max , why are you trying to convince her
to not be our intern ?
why are you not saying ,
&quot; you may get rabies and bubonic plague from our rats ? &quot;
don &apos;t mention the rats .
you &apos;re chasing them away .
and we do not have rats . we have rat droppings .
let &apos;s not jump to conclusions .
you &apos;re right , the rats are probably
just coming in here to use the bathroom .
look , we need an intern .
now , who do you like so far ?
the one with the big boobs .
i knew it . all you big boob people stick together .
hi , girls .
are you having a beauty contest and didn &apos;t invite me
to give the other girls a chance ?
we &apos;re interviewing people to be our intern .
who doesn &apos;t get paid .
well , this is for you .
you didn &apos;t have to do that .
you already gave us the money for the shop .
i know , i &apos;m too wonderful .
but it &apos;s for good luck ,
and sounds like you &apos;re gonna need it .
oleg says that it &apos;s rat central station around here .
not rats , sophie , just rat droppings .
oh , just rat droppings .
oh , okay , no problem there .
are you out of breath
because you jogged here all the way from 1974 ?
sexy , huh ?
you should see his badunkadunk when he jogs .
well , here they are . 60 rat traps .
girls ...
i don &apos;t want to interfere with your business ,
but what the hell is goin &apos; on here ?
there &apos;s no fancy tables or pretty chairs .
i mean , this place is so unappealing ,
even i don &apos;t look good here .
no worries .
we have some adorable old @-@ school ice cream tables and chairs
on hold at a kooky , fun staten island junkyard .
i can &apos;t believe you didn &apos;t just shoot a blood clot
trying to make dump furniture sound cute .
okay , girls , well , call me when you have a real business .
yeah , and i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m gonna take this ,
you know , so that the rats don &apos;t poop in it .
come on , badunkadunk .
oh , and , uh , max ...
oh , she &apos;s good . yes .
i knew it . all you big boob people stick together .
well ?
here we are .
the final three .
well , you know the one i like . i &apos;ll give you a clue .
one , two .
standing in front of me i see two beautiful ,
qualified young women .
is she really going all top model right now ?
if only . they pay .
i &apos;m out , tyra .
ruth , congratulations .
you &apos;ve been selected to be our intern .
max , will you get ruth started on something ?
yup , i got the internship .
you know what ? i got it .
it &apos;s not like you &apos;re getting paid .
big boob people are so much easier .
as a kid , people told you
everything you did was amazing , didn &apos;t they ?
i was given a lot of positive reinforcement .
i think it gave me the confidence
that &apos;s gotten me through this last year .
well , it &apos;s time you heard the truth .
you stink at stuff .
like painting .
fine . and you stink at stuff too .
like telling an intern what to do .
ruth had to go to that concert .
she had the tickets for weeks .
it was ashley d and ashley b &apos;s joint birthday . duh .
and so the intern &apos;s out having fun ,
and here we are , the bosses ,
painting the walls at 3 : 00 a.m.
well , i &apos;m painting .
you got a kind of autistic ballerina thing going on over there .
can i ask you something ?
i don &apos;t like maroon 5 .
no matter how many times you ask ,
the answer will always be no .
not that .
would it be okay if i told andy not to come over tonight
&apos;cause i &apos;m so exhausted ,
or is it a little too early in the relationship to be all ,
&quot; i don &apos;t think i can have my legs up around my ears tonight &quot; ?
it &apos;s fine .
you don &apos;t think he &apos;d enjoy a night off
from constant maroon 5 badgering ? he would .
feels awkward . can &apos;t .
my legs can go up there . they &apos;re fine .
i don &apos;t want to have that conversation right now .
hey , look , i get it .
there are conversations you don &apos;t want to have .
like , &quot; hey , ruth , here &apos;s $ 0 .
put down some rat traps . &quot;
we have a box right here that &apos;s not touched .
look , we &apos;re not talking about your relationship anymore .
we &apos;re done .
relax . it &apos;s probably not even a rat ,
it &apos;s probably a mouse . not a big deal .
oh , my god ! oh , my god , i see it ! there it is !
the mouse ?
that is not a mouse !
that is a car that a mouse drives !
oh my god . where did you see it ?
it was in the middle , right ?
why are you whispering ?
i don &apos;t want him to hear me .
how do you know it &apos;s a he ?
he looked at me kind of rapey .
there ! he just ran behind the thing !
what thing ?
that thing !
this thing ? waah !
what ? did you see it ?
i don &apos;t think so .
oh , you &apos;d know so . it has a saddle .
oh , my god .
he just opened the door with the strength of his whiskers .
he &apos;s gone . he went into the kitchen .
oh , what should we do ?
should we call the cops ?
he doesn &apos;t have a gun .
let &apos;s just get out of here .
we &apos;ll call an exterminator in the morning .
too late , he &apos;s coming back !
aah ! he &apos;s charging us !
he &apos;s gonna bite me !
waah ! you can stop now !
you painted him to death .
i just got a glimpse of you at a barneys sample sale .
what a mess . who &apos;s gonna clean that up ?
the intern ?
oh , andy ...
i know . i &apos;m good at this .
what ? is there another rat ?
what are you doing ?
i forgot andy was here !
and your sex voice is the same as your murder voice .
so are you just gonna stand there ?
are you offering me a three @-@ way ?
well , it looks like we &apos;re about to be a full @-@ blown orgy .
it &apos;s 2 : 00 a.m. who could this be ?
it &apos;s ruth .
ruth ?
yes . i &apos;m late , right ?
why is she here ?
i texted her and said you needed an enema .
okay , now , this is some industrial @-@ strength girl talk .
i had to do something to show her who was boss .
i learned it while interning at conde nast .
we &apos;ve all gotten someone an enema in the middle of the night ,
it &apos;s a rite of passage .
for someone to get their passage right ?
beat me to it .
there . go open the door .
you know what has to happen .
max has to put ruth in her place
so she can learn how to be a boss .
oh . that &apos;s all ? good .
&apos;cause i thought from your tone ,
you were gonna force max to have an enema .
sorry i &apos;m late .
i had the tiniest pot cookie and had to pull over to take a nap .
anyway , here is your enema . enjoy .
they only had the triple pack .
wait , ruth ?
max has something she wants to say to you .
max , what did you want to say to ruth ?
um , thanks for the triple ?
three times the fun .
you sure you don &apos;t want me to help you with that ?
oh , no , it &apos;s okay .
you took the rat traps out of the box , you need a break .
plus , we couldn &apos;t afford the game mouse trap when i was a kid ,
and this is the closest i &apos;m gonna get .
so , when do you make the cupcakes ?
i guess i could make them now .
fun . i &apos;ll go get the coffees , right ?
sure , of course . do whatever .
you got a life . who am i to tell you what to do ?
well , here &apos;s our martha stewart blurb ,
all blown up
and ready to roll out and paste up on that wall .
where &apos;s ruth ?
she &apos;s in the kitchen .
i was just in there .
then she &apos;s in the bathroom .
oh , my god , you &apos;re haning me !
she took a coffee break .
what ? she didn &apos;t need a break .
she just started 20 minutes ago .
your rich is really coming out ,
and it is not pretty .
forgot my phone .
i mean , get it together , ruth , right ?
watch and learn .
ruth , can you put the rat traps down , one in each corner ,
and then you can get coffee later after interning .
thanks .
she &apos;s kind of a tool , right ?
max , were you saying something ?
nope .
ouch !
right ?
oh , look at this cage .
i think my mom used to dance in it .
here they are .
these are the ones i had the guy hold for us .
only $ 600 for all of them .
what do ya think , daddy ?
i like &apos; em , doll . wrap &apos; em up .
and can daddy get something he wants ?
so cute . over the counter ?
and that way when i &apos;m hungover and taking a nap ,
people can still find the cupcakes .
we could have ruth clean it
and then paint and reupholster these .
by the way , where is she ?
she was supposed to be here an hour ago .
text her and find out where she is .
why are you so interested in where she is , what she &apos;s doing ?
are you obsessed with her ?
max , i don &apos;t want to make a purse out of her skin .
i just want her to do her job .
never mind . i &apos;ll just text her .
well , be careful .
don &apos;t delete any of my penis with a hat pictures .
even if i did , it &apos;s not a big deal .
oleg will always pose again .
yeah , but i &apos;ll never get that little pilgrim hat back .
&quot; where are you ? we needed you here yesterday . &quot;
all in caps , &apos; cause bosses talk in caps .
total tool .
look at that .
texted right back , &apos; cause i &apos;m the boss .
she says ...
yesterday was super hard so she &apos;s not feeling great
and she can &apos;t come in today ?
that &apos;s it . she &apos;s fired .
here . you have to fire her .
she said she was sick , conde nasty .
she &apos;s not sick , she &apos;s just taking advantage
&apos;cause you &apos;re too friendly with her .
she works for us .
yeah , for free .
why don &apos;t you just hollow her out
and live inside of her , you monster ?
um , i don &apos;t think we were supposed to get this .
&quot; the dumb one wants me to pick up all this crappy furniture .
right ?
as if .
i &apos;ll be at the bar in ten . order me a bellini . &quot;
oh , who &apos;s the monster now ?
she called you the dumb one .
uh , she called you the dumb one .
it &apos;s your phone , you &apos;re the dumb one .
she knows i don &apos;t talk in caps , so that &apos;s to you .
you &apos;re the dumb one .
fire her .
no , you fire her .
no , you fire her .
no , you hired her , you fire her .
i wanted to go with molly big boobs .
she &apos;d be here right now with four chairs on each boob .
why can &apos;t you just fire her ?
it &apos;s clear she called you the dumb one .
all right , fine , i know she called me the dumb one .
but i can &apos;t fire her .
i want to , but there is a block .
right here .
it comes up , and then goes , &quot; nope ! &quot;
it goes right back down .
i am not supposed to fire someone .
i am the someone who &apos;s supposed to be fired .
so i guess i &apos;m the boss , then .
sounds like a plan . i &apos;ll be in my mom &apos;s cage .
all right , come on , you lowly worker .
help the boss pull these chairs out .
don &apos;t yell at me , boss . i &apos;m blocked .
wish you had your enemas now , don &apos;t you ?
they followed us ! we walked into a trap !
it &apos;s a vendetta !
ugh , i can &apos;t believe this !
our intern &apos;s out having cocktails
and i &apos;m trapped on top of rat mountain !
he &apos;s coming after me !
oh , my god !
max ! help !
no , you bastards ! get off her !
get off !
my foot &apos;s caught under this thing !
max , that was amazing .
you just lifted that giant thing up with one hand .
i know .
and now i &apos;m gonna fire that bitch !
wow . you suck at this too .
sorry i &apos;m late .
i was having a dream that i was sleeping in ,
then i woke up , and i was .
who &apos;s the boss ?
tony danza ?
no , max , who &apos;s the boss ?
i am .
have a seat , ruth .
here ?
good call .
in addition to being a boss ,
i am also a waitress .
but when i do my job , i don &apos;t call people dumb .
all right , i do , but at least it &apos;s to their face .
oh , you &apos;re talking about that thing ?
i meant caroline .
no , i know you meant me ,
because i &apos;m not dumb and neither is caroline .
and one thing i figured out is that in business ,
maybe i have to be a little more ruthless .
meaning no more ruth . you &apos;re fired .
so , i &apos;m not getting college credit ?
i &apos;ll probably get kicked out of school again ,
but no worries , right ?
i &apos;m really proud of how you stuck up for yourself .
you &apos;re fired . sorry , i can &apos;t stop .
look , max .
