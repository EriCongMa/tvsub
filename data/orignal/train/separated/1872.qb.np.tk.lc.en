right now ?
well , where ?
that was pathetic .
shut up .
she told you to go screw yourself .
we could hear it all the way over here .
it &apos;s not &apos; cause she wasn &apos;t into me .
oh , does &quot; go screw yourself &quot; have some secret meaning
we &apos;re not aware of ?
i kinda already knew her . i just didn &apos;t remember .
you slept with her before and forgot about it
and then tried to pick her up all over again ?
you &apos;re not even drinking .
i have a history of alzheimer &apos;s in my family .
what &apos;s your excuse ?
it &apos;s o &apos;malley &apos;s fault .
i mean , talking about dead people ,
it throws me off my game , that &apos;s all .
it &apos;s janet .
can you , uh , pay for my , uh , thing ?
yeah , yeah , yeah .
thank you . hey , hey , janet .
i gotta run .
would you pay for mine ?
no . i &apos;m leaving . i &apos;m going to the skills lab .
oh , come on .
she had the social worker on the phone .
you can fish 20 bucks out of your pocket .
i want to see you for a follow @-@ up next week .
and listen , i know drew is a kid wh a lot of energy ,
but we just put a bunch of screws in your back ,
so you gotta take it easy for a few weeks .
and i am not kidding about physical therapy .
you &apos;re gonna need all the support you can get
to keep up with ... that little one .
i &apos;m gonna do it . i really am .
you feelin &apos; okay ?
i still kinda like the idea of keeping you here another day .
no , it &apos;s been three days .
you know , it &apos;s hard on drew . he needs his mom .
i just want to get home .
okay .
mommy !
hey , sweetheart ! hey !

we will .
thank you so much .
anytime .
what did janet say ?
meredith ?
we &apos;re not getting her back .
what do you mean ? what-- what exactly did she say ?
that we &apos;re not getting her back .
she said that ?
she said that the court ...
canceled our hearing date .
and when they do that , it means either one of two things--
that they looked at our file
and they love us and they &apos;re giving her to us ,
in which case they call janet and they tell her that ,
or that they hate us
and they &apos;re giving her to another family .
and she didn &apos;t get the &quot; they love us &quot; call .
well , maybe they didn &apos;t get around to it .
she said we should move on .
that &apos;s what she said .
you want to know her exact words--
were &quot; i think it &apos;s time that you and derek
start thinking about moving on . &quot;
oh , my god .
oh , god . how can they do this ?
you can cry .
i don &apos;t want to cry .
i know .
i &apos;m never gonna see her again .
god .
okay , stop . i don &apos;t want to cry .
okay . i know .
call up to c.t. tell &apos; em we &apos;re on our way up .
screw c.t. and go straight to the bronchoscope .
you need to find out what is down there .
c.t. will clarify what we &apos;re dealing with .
it won &apos;t delay anything , and you &apos;re not his doctor .
richard is .
i hear he &apos;s good . i mean , i @-@ i don &apos;t know ,
he &apos;s new around here .
she doesn &apos;t like it when i &apos;m in the hospital .
makes you wonder why she married a guy with chronic illness .
masochist . call me if you need anything .
i &apos;m coming to c.t.
i wouldn &apos;t have it any other way .
good .
meredith is in the e.r.
look at this . scalpels from the 1860s .
i want to get &apos; em for meredith .
she needs to talk to you .
oh , can you distract her ?
it &apos;s on ebay ,
and i got 25 minutes left on the auction .
derek , janet called .
the baby was born a couple of hours ago ,
and it looks like a tracheoesophageal fistula .
you know what that is ?
yeah , it &apos;s the connection between ,
the trachea and esophagus .
fills the lungs with secretions .
baby can have a hard time breathing and feeding .
exactly , bentley hospital is tiny . they can &apos;t handle it .
so you need to go pick up the baby , bring her back ,
and then hopefully , i &apos;m done with the kid
that &apos;s on his way in by the time you &apos;re back .
you need to reconfigure the ambulance
for intensive neonatal transport .
and i think you should get someone else to go--
grey , ride with karev . he &apos;s on a baby run .
well , i have to talk to derek .
well , newborn life hanging in the balance . make it fast .
10 @-@ year @-@ old male , dog bite to the face .
vital signs stable in the field .
all right , trauma three .
laura .
hey , dr. avery .
honey , this is my guy .
you must be griffin .
and drew .
hey , your mom said that you were a kid ,
but you are almost as tall as me .
you &apos;re not that tall .
so , listen , thanks so much for taking such good care of her .
my pleasure . how you feelin &apos; ?
oh , just ready to go home .
okay , but you make sure to give me a page
when you come in for a follow @-@ up , all right ?
nice to meet you .
i , uh , see what you mean about those eyes .
if i weren &apos;t such a confident guy ,
i might have to , like , challenge him to a duel or something .
honey .
can we get some help , please ?
maybe there &apos;s an appeal process .
did you ask ?
i didn &apos;t .
you talk to the lawyer ?
i just got off the phone with janet .
we &apos;ll appeal . we &apos;ll sue the agency if we have to .
they don &apos;t think we should be zola &apos;s parents , derek .
they don &apos;t think i &apos;m trustworthy ,
and they &apos;re not the first ones to raise that concern .
meredith .
they don &apos;t think i should be zola &apos;s mother .
she &apos;s gone .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
we &apos;re gonna find a way .
zola was our baby ,
and she &apos;s gone , and i don &apos;t want another baby .
she &apos;s barely got any pulse .
what was she in for ?
a thoracic spinal fusion to fix her scoliosis .
dr. torres just released her , and she was doing fine .
okay , heart sounds are muffled .
let &apos;s call altman .
she &apos;s not protecting her airway . i &apos;m gonna intubate .
is she okay ?
sir , there &apos;s a waiting room .
what &apos;s happening ?
take your son out of here .
we will let you know when we know .
we &apos;re gonna need the ultrasound ,
and somebody find torres .
right away .
they can put on some music .
nah , i &apos;ll just take a nap .
you &apos;re gonna be fine . you know that , right ?
i do .
good .
i just wish i hadn &apos;t spent the day
trying to kill your hopes and dreams .
you know , that &apos;s why i started spitting up blood ,
so i &apos;d win .
i &apos;m happy to have you go to medical school .
you don &apos;t have to be happy .
no , i am . i &apos;m not--
i @-@ i love med students .
i &apos;ll help you study .
you &apos;ll be my study buddy ?
i &apos;ll make you flash cards .
that &apos;s so hot , i &apos;m not sure i can even handle it .
it &apos;ll be fun .
it &apos;s your worst nightmare .
yeah . whatever .
we &apos;ll figure it out .
don &apos;t move .
where &apos;s bailey ?
uh , henry doesn &apos;t need both of us ,
and we all agreed that you &apos;d be less of a hassle
with the former chief of surgery .
nice . you &apos;re nice people .
so are you planning to get a look with contrast
or just the non @-@ contrast study ?
which would you prefer ?
both .
um , can you get some contrast ready ?
gotta it .
thanks .
are you kidding me ?
the e.r.
owen wants a consult .
well , go ahead .
it &apos;ll take five minutes , and we don &apos;t both need
to stand here watching the c.t. load .
are you sure ?
if you &apos;re not back in five ,
i &apos;ll find you as soon as the film comes up .
you will ?
i said i would , didn &apos;t i ?
thank you .
look at that .
what the hell happened ?
that &apos;s what i was gonna ask you .
she &apos;s in shock and ...
it looks like her pericardium &apos;s full of blood .
she just had spinal surgery .
wh @-@ why would she ...
i was hoping you would answer that .
she &apos;s arresting .
all right . i &apos;m gonna do a thoracotomy .
open up a chest tray . kepner ...
prep the chest .
you &apos;re gonna crack her chest ? she &apos;s not a trauma .
yes , but she &apos;s dying .
it &apos;s probably a mistake .
you know , courts-- they screw up all the time .
you call &apos; em in the morning--
it &apos;s over , alex .
it &apos;s been over for a while . everyone knew it .
no one wants to say it .
so get--get a surrogate or whatever .
you can &apos;t just write off having a family like that .
get yang to carry a kid for you .
she gets knocked up at the drop of a--
if you don &apos;t shut up in the next three seconds ,
i &apos;m gonna shove you out of the back of the rig .
what the hell is happening ?
what do we got ?
i had to open her up . her pericardium is full of blood .
ton of clots .
gunshot ?
no , she had spinal fusion three days ago .
what ?
i don &apos;t know .
she has no history of heart disease or risk factors .
this is crazy .
could it be a retrograde dissection ?
no , i don &apos;t think so . she has no history of marfan &apos;s
or aortic widening on x @-@ ray .
oh , her heart &apos;s beating again .
all right , let &apos;s get her upstairs now .
throw a sterile towel on her and move .
all right , people . let &apos;s go .
i don &apos;t need you in there . i &apos;m good .
okay . well , she &apos;s my patient .
did you cut her heart open in your spinal fusion ?
uh , no .
then she &apos;s my patient .
all right , henry &apos;s in c.t.
somebody tell webber where i am .
oh , oh , oh , hold on .
teddy !
right there . the bronchus .
judging by the ossification , probably a carcinoid tumor .
because of his tumor condition ?
yeah , he &apos;s bleeding in his lungs and trachea .
lexie &apos;s prepping him . we &apos;re gonna take it out .
you &apos;re gonna bronch him and use a laser ?
i was planning to open him up .
take out the lung , resect the tumor ,
put it back in .
a laser is less invasive
and the recovery time is much faster .
i hear that , but i &apos;ve never done one with a laser .
what ?
not for this kind of procedure .
and i don &apos;t want my first one to be on your husband .
well , i ...
i think we should get another surgeon .
cristina .
no . come on .
taylor is on vacation .
goldman is 45 minutes away .
i did an endobronchial tumor with cristina last week
with a laser .
i barely did a thing . she did it all .
we &apos;ve done three in the last year .
teddy , it--it &apos;s just too much pressure .
now she &apos;s a resident , it &apos;s her mentor &apos;s husband .
she &apos;s a machine . she doesn &apos;t care if it &apos;s my husband .
no , she &apos;s not . we can get rudzki .
rudzki &apos;s an ass , and he &apos;s sloppy .
gown .
i think we should reconsider having webber do this .
i don &apos;t have anything to prove .
if i &apos;m not state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art , have yang do it .
there &apos;s no question ,
henry &apos;s on his feet faster if we don &apos;t open him up .
cristina doesn &apos;t have to know that it &apos;s henry .
drape his face , don &apos;t show her the chart ,
give her a verbal history .
you put a bronchoscope and a laser in her hand ,
she &apos;s not gonna ask
for the guy &apos;s name and , uh , a family photo .
she is gonna cut .
you really think this is a good idea ?
look , i &apos;ll be there the whole time .
if she has trouble ,
i &apos;ll go in and open him up the old @-@ fashioned way .
lap sponges , please .
owen ? is he scowling ?
yeah . so am i.
i don &apos;t like it either .
frankly , the only thing that i &apos;d be comfortable with
is doing it myself .
but since we all know that that &apos;s not gonna happen .
the next closest thing is yang .
she is the only one who will do it the way i would .
fine .
what &apos;d he say ?
uh , he said fine .
thank you .
richard , watch her like a hawk .
if she screws this up ,
you &apos;re gonna have to take out half his lung .
and the last thing i need is to have to explain to my husband
why that happened .
i &apos;ll watch her .
cautery . keep suctioning .
you gotta get some of those clots out .
okay . good .
hey , we &apos;re here to pick up a newborn ,
take her to seattle grace .
you &apos;re , uh , you &apos;re looking for me .
i &apos;m jordan wagner . i am really glad to see you guys .
yeah , i &apos;m alex karev . meredith grey .
okay . li--uh , listen , she was born six hours ago ,
right away , trouble breathing .
stomach looked distended , so we put down an n.g. tube .
but the x @-@ ray showed that it was just coiling in her chest .
we &apos;ve done everything we can to keep her breathing ,
but it &apos;s been a struggle .
you don &apos;t have a neonatal mask ?
we &apos;re not set up for neonatal or o.b.
she was an emergency delivery ,
otherwise , we would &apos;ve sent her to the hospital in leavenworth .
pulse ox is 79 . respiratory rate is 80 .
she &apos;s got retractions .
how come she &apos;s not intubated ?
the smallest tube we had didn &apos;t fit .
please tell me that you brought a neonatal tube .
we &apos;re gonna need x @-@ ray in here for a post @-@ intubation film .
this i.v. &apos; s no good .
yeah , you don &apos;t even have a neonatal central line kit .
no .
i.o. needle ?
no .
you will not call dr. yang into the o.r.
until henry is intubated and draped .
you will make sure to drape every inch of his face .
you will give a verbal history ,
and you will simply omit the patient &apos;s name .
but dr. webber &apos;s gonna be in there ?
yes .
and he knows ?
he knows , you know . dr. yang does not .
can you handle this ?
you sure ?
yeah . i @-@ i mean , i &apos;m gonna be wearing a mask , right ?
i mean , as long as i don &apos;t start giggling then we &apos;re ...
we &apos;re fine .
she doesn &apos;t want any kids at all ?
zola was her baby . she doesn &apos;t want another baby .
ah , she &apos;ll come around .
she &apos;s upset . give her some time .
i don &apos;t know .
look , if it doesn &apos;t work out , you can always share sofia .
there &apos;s three of us parenting her already . it kinda works .
no one gets too exhausted , you &apos;re not on very night .
we can work you into the rotation .
she &apos;s a baby . she &apos;s not a time @-@ share in cabo .
you &apos;re close @-@ minded . that &apos;s your problem .
that &apos;s my problem ?
avery .
what &apos;s the deal ?
nose is hanging off and a lot of soft tissue loss .
probably nerve damage .
i &apos;ll let you know when dr. robbins is ready for you .
it &apos;s karev .
how &apos;s it going ?
the kid &apos;s septic . she &apos;s got pneumonia .
was she intubated when you got there ?
yeah , well , they don &apos;t have any neonatal stuff here at all .
we intubated , we started an umbilical line
to hang d10 normal saline and antibiotics .
but her sats aren &apos;t coming up ,
and all the oxygen &apos;s going into her stomach .
you &apos;re gonna need to put in an amplatz umbrella .
they don &apos;t have a 3 @-@ 0 e.t. tube .
you think they &apos;re gonna have an amplatz ?
all right . elevate her head .
all right . get her head up .
all right , do they have a fogarty catheter ?
they use those on grown @-@ ups .
a fogarty catheter ?
yeah , what else ?
you &apos;re gonna have to
thread the fogarty down her trachea , pretty far down ,
then blow up the balloon ,
and pull up until you get traction .
that &apos;ll occlude the fistula
and get the air flowing into the lungs .
you &apos;re gonna have to keep the blind pouch clear on your way back .
and i &apos;m not sure you have
anything in your box that &apos;s gonna do that .
uh , how about an 8 french suction catheter ?
yeah , that &apos;ll work .
got it . all right .
we &apos;re gonna call you when we get to rig .
hey , alex .
you don &apos;t have a lot of time . you know that , right ?
yeah , i know that .
look at that .
there &apos;s a huge tear in the left ventricle .
can you repair it ?
no , it &apos;s too big . we &apos;re gonna have to go on bypass .
dr. altman , i &apos;ve got your husband .
oh , good . henry .
hey , babe .
i am so sorry .
this woman &apos;s heart is spouting like a fountain
for no apparent reason .
that sounds like fun .
well , if there was any way i could get out of here , i would .
stop worrying about it .
you can hold my hand ... in post @-@ op .
you were such a wuss before my last surgery ,
it &apos;s probably a good thing anyway .
yeah , that wasn &apos;t my best work .
we &apos;re an old married couple now .
you don &apos;t have to drive me to the airport .
you don &apos;t have to walk me to the o.r.
well , i still want rides to the airport .
that &apos;s &apos; cause you &apos;re high maintenance .
you know it .
look , i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll see you after .
henry , don &apos;t ask for extra morphine
just &apos; cause you like the dreams .
get back to work .
love you .
yeah , you , too .
all right . i &apos;m good .
more sponges , please .
wow . there aren &apos;t enough sponges in the world .
suction .
must be hard for her to be in the o.r.
and not here with you .
can i tell you something kind of embarrassing ?
yeah .
i want to go to med school .
that &apos;s not embarrassing .
i wouldn &apos;t exactly be the youngest kid in my class .
yeah , but you &apos;ll be mature .
you &apos;ll have perspective .
none of us had that in our class .
teddy &apos;s not crazy about the idea .
we kinda had a ...
a big fight about it right before all this happened .
well , she might need some time to get used to the idea .
none of this is very easy on relationships .
you seem to do okay .
jackson , right ? he &apos;s--he &apos;s great .
yeah . though we &apos;re not together anymore .
oh . um ... mark sloan ?
we &apos;re not together either .
so who &apos;s ... who &apos;s gonna be operating on me ?
dr. webber ?
i don &apos;t know .
hey . teddy &apos;s got a patient with an endobronchial carcinoid .
she wants you to take care of it .
now ?
yes .
why can &apos;t she do it herself ?
well , she &apos;s working on a woman who almost bled out in the e.r.
so , uh , she can &apos;t do it .
well , how about goldman ?
she &apos;s giving you a chance to fly solo on a major procedure .
i know , but we just did a similar one .
i basically handled the whole thing myself
while she planned the menu for what sounded like
a really boring brunch .
and i &apos;m supposed to do my first bentall procedure tomorrow .
it &apos;s from my bucket list .
i &apos;m practicing the steps . you want to see ?
okay , drop the damn suture and go scrub . all right ?
okay . relax .
this better be fast . i want to be fresh tomorrow .
cristina , this is emergent .
yeah , i &apos;m going .
i &apos;m just saying , i &apos;m glad she likes me ,
but if she &apos;s gonna call me every time
she has a procedure she doesn &apos;t feel like doing ...
i mean , i &apos;m not her valet .
maybe it &apos;s not the end .
you &apos;ll call the lawyers in the morning .
and maybe there &apos;s something else you guys can do .
meredith didn &apos;t want kids .
i pushed her . she opened herself up .
now i feel like i ...
i did this to her .
she wanted it , too ,
or it wouldn &apos;t have happened .
she &apos;ll blame me ...
like i &apos;ve been blaming her .
we lost zola , and now if i lose meredith ...
she always comes back .
she might need a minute to back away , but ...
she comes back .
try this patch on the tear .
we &apos;re gonna have to cut it to size .
ah , hang on .
sorry . i ... my glove is stuck on something .
i &apos;m taking my hand out .
what happened ?
there &apos;s a hole in my glove .
you &apos;re kidding .
can we get dr. kepner a new glove , please ?
did it break the skin ?
no . i think i &apos;m fine .
here you go .
thanks .
my god .
what the hell is that ?
dr. yang .
we just started the bronchoscopy .
looking forward to seeing your work .
hopefully i &apos;ll learn a thing or two .
it &apos;s an honor , sir .
uh , 35 @-@ year @-@ old male ,
endobronchial carcinoid tumor ,
presented with active hemoptysis .
he &apos;s been given two liters l.r.
and a unit of packed cells .
okay .
so we &apos;ll resect with the co2 laser .
is it ready to go ?
yes .
you know , i think i &apos;m gonna time myself .
last time i did this , it took me like
two and a half hours , skin to skin .
that &apos;s too long .
i think i get hypnotized , um ,
when i watch that laser or something .
we should be able to get it down to , like , two hours .
let &apos;s start the timer for dr. yang .
okay , laser , please .
is that them ?
wait . i &apos;m coming with you .
dana ?
why is she out here ?
she said if i didn &apos;t take her , she &apos;d walk .
i was afraid she &apos;d try it .
please let me come with her .
dana ... you just had surgery ,
and you &apos;ve lost a lot of blood .
i &apos;ll be fine . please .
i need you to take care of yourself .
these guys , they &apos;re the best .
she is in great hands .
please .
she &apos;s my baby .
we &apos;re supposed to be together .
i can &apos;t leave her . she &apos;s so little .
please .
i have to be with her .
please let me go with her .
i &apos;m dr. grey . and that &apos;s dr. karev .
and we &apos;re gonna take your daughter
to the best baby surgeon there is .
she doesn &apos;t even have a name yet .
well , you &apos;re gonna give her one when you come to seattle
and hold her in your arms .
and until that time , i &apos;m gonna take care of her .
you hear me ?
i have her .
okay ?
what happened ?
show her the tray .
that &apos;s the screw
that i just pulled out of your patient .
it was stabbing her heart , slicing into cardiac muscle
everytime the heart tried to beat .
this thing looks like hamburger meat right about now .
oh , my god .
you want to tell me how this happened ?
you know , why not try adoption again ?
social services just took our kid away .
what do you think , if we wait a week , they &apos;ll forget
and give us another try with a new kid ?
all right . so get a surrogate .
alex .
why not ?
because i don &apos;t want a surrogate .
okay ? just drop it .
no . you just don &apos;t give up like that .
it &apos;s nice that you care ,
but it really isn &apos;t any of your business .
it is . it &apos;s my fault .
i can &apos;t handle being responsible for you not having kids .
it &apos;s too much .
i--it &apos;s not your fault .
yeah , it is .
no , it &apos;s my fault .
i got the ball rolling . i messed with the trial .
what you did was trudy , but what i did was illegal .
who cares ? you just don &apos;t give up .
it &apos;s lame . you &apos;re not a quitter .
that &apos;s not who you are .
dude , what &apos;s the problem ?
i &apos;m kind of in the middle of a surgery .
no , here &apos;s what you &apos;re in the middle of .
the surgery on laura lewis ,
where i supervised you inserting pedicle screws
and a plate to stabilize t @-@ 6 to t @-@ 8 ?
one of them &apos;s stabbing her in the heart .
she &apos;s half dead ,
and we &apos;re about to go tell her husband .
so using a laser &apos;s not much different
than a normal bronchoscopic resection ?
uh , yes .
you just have to be extra careful
with hidden vascular structures
when using this high a level of energy .
but you &apos;re forming an eschar as you go ,
so the blood &apos;s coagulating along the way .
pretty much .
that is pretty handy .
oh , okay . what happened ?
ugh . i must have nicked a vessel .
pressure &apos;s dropping .
okay , so i &apos;m giving it more irrigation .
ah , the whole field &apos;s obscured .
what happened to the engine ?
i don &apos;t know what the crap it is .
i called for another unit ,
but we &apos;re in the middle of nowhere .
it &apos;s gonna take forever .
i &apos;m putting these out and i &apos;m gonna run back .
it looked like there was a store or something
about half a mile back .
maybe they got a truck . you gotta get out of the rig .
it &apos;s pouring rain and freezing .
we can &apos;t go out there with the baby .
there &apos;s no shoulder .
it &apos;s not like we can just take the incubator out .
i mean , there &apos;s not even anywhere to stand .
this thing is full of oxygen tanks .
we get hit , it &apos;ll go up like a roman candle .
you gotta get out .
and leave the baby ?
she &apos;ll die .
you want to all die ? i &apos;m putting these out .
you better hope people can see &apos; em .
you &apos;re on a hill and you &apos;re on a curve .
i &apos;m telling you , get out the damn rig .
hey , you need some help ?
why ?
well , his pressure dropped out .
oh , there was a nick in an artery .
i cauterized , and his pressure came back up .
okay , but what if it was a carcinoid crisis ?
uh , i doubt it .
but if his pressure drops out again ,
i &apos;ll think about a dose of octreotide .
cristina--
i &apos;m on a clock , and you &apos;re wasting my time .
what is your problem ?
cristina , there &apos;s a patient on the table .
let go of the clock and focus on what you &apos;re doing .
i am focused .
i &apos;d focus a whole lot better
if you weren &apos;t standing here with your pants on fire .
we &apos;ve got it , dr. hunt .
apparently , one of the screws
we placed in her spine came loose .
uh , it could be that the bone isn &apos;t strong enough
to hold the screw .
but at this point , we don &apos;t know .
okay , and so what , it just , um ,
and so the screw , it--
it cut into her heart ?
dr. altman &apos;s repairing her heart right now ,
and she &apos;s an incredible surgeon .
but , uh , we won &apos;t know for a while
exactly what the situation is .
situation ? i--but i-- i don &apos;t understand .
where &apos;s my mama ?
oh , buddy .
buddy . come here .
look at that .
very nice .
right ?
if i do say so myself .
oh , hang on . we &apos;ve got some bleeding .
okay , you have some clots blocking your scope .
why don &apos;t you take out your laser
and pass a brush through it ?
okay . okay .
sats are down to 88 .
okay , uh , i &apos;m gonna have to open him up .
just let me just try this first .
yang , yang , you have blood
coming in through the e.t. tube .
get outta there .
i can clear the field--
get his chest ready , grey . we &apos;re going in .
okay , okay , i &apos;m pulling out .
10 @-@ blade .
10 @-@ blade .
find all the films--pre @-@ op , post @-@ op .
you go over every inch of every image
and assuming she survives , you get a c.t.
to check the hardware
and run a bone density test ...
so we can get a clue as to what the hell went wrong .
oh . i , uh ...
i &apos;m so sorry . i @-@ i have to go , dr torres .
i &apos;m sorry .
what ?
avery put pedicle screws
in a woman &apos;s spine this week ,
and one of them turned out to be
tearing holes in her left ventricle .
whoa .
i can &apos;t--i can &apos;t-- i can &apos;t even breathe right now .
yeah , well , come on . it &apos;s part of the deal .
we have to let students operate .
they don &apos;t always get it right .
i was reading a magazine .
hey , come on .
now don &apos;t beat yourself up . we all do it .
i know what j.lo wore to the coffeehouse .
that &apos;s what i was doing .
vascular clamp .
he is losing way too much blood way too fast .
okay , put the blood on a rapid infuser
and get me another two units up here .
right away .
he &apos;s really bradycardic .
okay , let &apos;s push one atropine . now .
uh , hold on . wait . wait . wait .
this tumor has eroded
right through the pulmonary artery .
damn it .
let me see .
sir ...
okay . let &apos;s clamp the hilum .
uh , he &apos;s already lost half his blood volume .
this lung is like a sieve .
i-- give me bovie .
we &apos;re maxed out on dopamine .
maxed out on norepis .
sir , i &apos;m not sure what we do next .
v @-@ fib .
okay , push one of epi . now .
i &apos;m gonna start compressions .
ah-- let &apos;s get this outta here .
come on , people .
okay , here we go .
come on .
look at that .
his nose is gonna be perfect .
this is gonna be beautiful .
if you do say so yourself .
i offered to time @-@ share sofia
with derek and meredith
if they don &apos;t end up with kids of their own .
he said no .
why ?
because your child is not a rental car .
we &apos;re not gonna take her out one week a month .
have you seen her ?
&apos;cause she &apos;s heart @-@ stoppingly adorable .
you &apos;re missing the point .
he &apos;s missing the point .
no , she &apos;s delicious . she &apos;s addictive .
why wouldn &apos;t you want to parent her ?
i just find--
ambulance broke down , like , in the middle of the road .
they can &apos;t move . they can &apos;t get out .
did they send a backup ?
it &apos;s--it &apos;s coming , but it &apos;s slow .
put her on speakerphone .
alex ?
we can &apos;t move . we &apos;re a friggin &apos; sitting duck .
we ... the ... ba--
all right , hold on . i can &apos;t hear you . say that again .
we gotta take the baby out of here ,
but the two of us can &apos;t move the damned incubator
and all this crap on a highway .
did you set up the flares ?
okay , leave the phone .
see if you can get a helicopter up there .
yeah . take this ?
sir , it &apos;s been 20 minutes .
there &apos;s no way that heart &apos;s coming back .
sir , there &apos;s no blood left to circulate .
i &apos;m not sure what you &apos;re ...
um ... time of death--
8 : 52 p.m.
there was no way to take it out without killing him .
and there &apos;s no way he could &apos;ve lived with it
in him for much longer ...
well , i &apos;ll write the op note , um ...
but if you can add a few lines ,
um , that make it clear
that i didn &apos;t come up with the treatment plan .
it &apos;s a bad outcome , and , um , i don &apos;t want
to take the heat for it in my fifth @-@ year boards .
it was dr. altman &apos;s idea .
oh , hey .
um ... the tumor eroded right through the pulmonary artery .
the guy bled right out .
uh , we were done before we started .
is there , um ,
uh , a family or ... something
we need to , uh , talk to ?
secure the umbilical line with extra tape .
you need the d10 .
put the oxygen tank in the holster ,
and take the paramedic kit .
get out of the rig .
swaddle her so that she stays warm .
we can &apos;t regulate--
what ?
we can &apos;t regulate her temp without the incubator .
they may have to leave the kid .
we are not leaving the baby .
at least one of you should get out of the rig .
what are they gonna do , flip a coin ?
they &apos;re sitting in a powder keg .
get out .
alex--
go . there &apos;s no reason for both of us to get killed .
well , i &apos;m not safer in the middle of the damn road .
i &apos;m telling you to get out of the damn rig .
alex , if you want to go , you go .
we &apos;re not gonna fix your guilt by me letting you
die in an ambulance so that i c--
is it possible the bone was intact
when they closed , and then--
and what , it just fell apart in the last couple of days ?
i don &apos;t know how you don &apos;t check
if a vertebra is compromised before you drop a screw in it .
hey .
how &apos;s it going with henry ?
uh , they &apos;re done .
oh . you almost finished here ?
oh , it &apos;s gonna be a while .
torres missed a loose screw in this woman &apos;s spine .
it tore apart her whole left ventricle .
i &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
i put in a patch .
i &apos;ve , uh , still gotta reinforce it
with a muscle flap .
it &apos;s just--it &apos;s-- it &apos;s a mess .
hey , will you--will you check on henry
and see if he &apos;s feeling okay ?
i ... i told him i would be in post @-@ op .
and i wasn &apos;t in pre @-@ op . i &apos;m--i &apos;m a bad wife .
i &apos;ll take over here . you can--you can go out .
all due respect ,
but you are out of your depth .
why does your face look like that ?
oh , there was an ambulance broke down on route 2,
so we--we lost contact .
oh , i hope everyone &apos;s all right .
ohh , route 2 at night ?
awful .
going over those mountains ?
so ...
henry ...
wants to go to med school .
can you believe it ?
no .
i mean , i @-@ i squashed the idea like a bug ,
which i feel awful about , but i mean , come on .
i mean , a med student at his age ?
that &apos;s crazy , right ? or--or am i just a terrible person ?
no .
no , i &apos;m not , or it &apos;s not crazy ?
the patch isn &apos;t holding .
oh , we cannot get a break here .
all right , let &apos;s try a pledget .
check on him ,
let me know how he &apos;s feeling-- would you ?
yeah , of course .
oh , and , you know , if you get bored ,
i mean , you could mention that med school is a long haul ,
and , you know , he may want
to try to get a degree in something else .
oh , and ...
he &apos;s a real stoner on dilaudid .
so don &apos;t be surprised if he compliments your eyes .
i just spoke to emergency dispatch .
another ambulance is coming now .
the cops are a few minutes out ,
and the helicopter wouldn &apos;t be any faster
since they leave out of skykomish .
are we still on speaker or what ?
uh , we were talking to them
and there was a loud noise and ...
we lost them .
avery ,
dr. shepherd &apos;s gonna put down his instruments
and you &apos;re gonna step in for him .
fancy part &apos;s over . we &apos;ll walk you through the rest .
derek .
all right .
it &apos;s not right .
who &apos;s gonna take over in the middle of a bypass ?
there &apos;s a woman on the table
who dies if teddy walks out of that o.r.
it &apos;s her husband , richard .
another hour isn &apos;t gonna change anything .
goldman &apos;s on his way . tell her then .
she &apos;s my friend .
you &apos;re not her friend right now .
you &apos;re the chief of surgery .
if she finds out that i waited ,
she will never forgive me .
her husband just died in our o.r.
she &apos;ll never forgive any of us .
hunt .
meredith and alex are trapped in an ambulance
in the middle of the highway .
i know .
we just lost contact . i think they got hit .
we need to get emergency dispatch on the phone .
what is it ?
what ?
all right . the ventricular laceration is still bleeding .
we need more volume .
we need some more blood .
right away .
she &apos;s dropping again .
come on , laura . you gotta pull it together .
okay , good . uh , there we go . 90 over 60 .
good . hello again . how &apos;s he doing ?
uh , he &apos;s fine . woozy . um , vitals are good .
uh , did they run a post @-@ op c.t. ?
uh , not yet .
but christina felt she &apos;s got clean margins ?
oh , yes .
did she figure it out ,
who she was operating on ?
no .
see ? i told you .
sometimes her lack of interest
in the patient as a human being
can come in handy .
did you mention the med school thing to henry ?
no .
you &apos;re a coward .
you know , if you think you are off the hook , you are wrong .
i mean , this could ruin the next five to ten years of my life .
you do understand that , right ?
these are the things we beg for ...
a root canal ...
an i.r.s. audit ...
coffee spilled on our clothes .
when the really terrible things happen ...
we start begging a god we don &apos;t believe in ...
to bring back the little horrors ...
and take away this .
are you okay ?
you &apos;re bleeding .
mer , what are you doing ?
get me a blanket . i &apos;m taking her out .
mer , put her back in .
she just got thrown around a plastic box .
she needs to be held . i &apos;m not putting he back in .
are you okay ?
no , i &apos;m not okay .
mer , listen , we gotta get outta here
before this thing blows .
well , how are we gonna do that ?
she &apos;s connected to a million things .
you got the bag and the baby .
i &apos;ll get the o2 tank and the i.v.
and we &apos;re gonna disconnect her from the antibiotics .
is that gonna be okay ?
yeah . it &apos;s gonna have to be .
it seems quaint now , doesn &apos;t it--
the flood in the kitchen , the poison oak ,
the fight that leaves you shaking with rage ?
would it have helped
if we could see what else was coming ?
would we have known
