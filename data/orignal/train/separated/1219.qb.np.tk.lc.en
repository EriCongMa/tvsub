mona placed some kind of lojack on her laptop before she died .
looks like it &apos;s a storage place off of the turnpike .
talmadge recently hired jackie molina
as an admissions officer .
i regret that i squandered my high school career
getting involved with an older guy .
tell me you didn &apos;t send this .
jackie read it .
what are you gonna tell ezra ?
jason and i , it was nothing .
you love ted , right ?
because he really loves you .
will you marry me ?
i need a minute .
is this you outside of work ?
casual looks good on you .
alison dilaurentis ,
you are under arrest for the murder of mona vanderwaal .
don &apos;t touch anything .
everything &apos;s bagged . it looks like evidence .
what did you and caleb find ?
i can &apos;t tell you .
hanna , that storage unit is rented in your name .
and i &apos;m pretty sure that mona &apos;s body is hidden inside of it .
you guys seriously think mona &apos;s body is in that barrel ?
yes .
we knew alison was crazy , but to do something like that ?
makes her even sicker than we thought .
and now that psychopath is targeting me .
租赁人 汉娜 · 玛琳
hanna , this has to be payback
from when you confronted her in jail .
whoa , slow down . when did you see ali ?
and how does aria know about that ,
and we &apos;re just finding out ?
guys , that has nothing to do with this . okay ?
that storage unit was rented in hanna &apos;s name
4 months ago , okay .
the day before mona was murdered .
so it was ali &apos;s plan all along to frame you .
yeah . and that bloody knife that toby found
i probably have my prints all over it .
i think it was a good choice to get rid of it .
yeah .
we should do the same thing with the stuff in the bin .
hanna . mona &apos;s body could seriously be in that barrel .
do you want to burn that , too ?
no . of course not .
but we can put it somewhere .
if we touch anything ,
that &apos;s tampering with the evidence .
evidence that could convict ali .
and me . and i don &apos;t have a good alibi .
yes , you do .
you were with me at your house ,
prepping the thanksgiving turkey .
caleb , we were alone .
the cops will just think that you &apos;re protecting me .
what about your mom ? where was she ?
she was at the soup kitchen with ted .
well , we do have one thing going for us .
we &apos;re a step ahead of holbrook .
he doesn &apos;t know that we traced mona &apos;s laptop
back to the storage unit .
how do we even know that holbrook &apos;s behind this ?
it could be any one of ali &apos;s little minions .
yesterday , we thought holbrook was reaching out to aria .
yeah , but he wasn &apos;t .
he sent me on a wild goose chase for ...
no reason .
my point is , we have some time to play a little offense .
i will corrupt their data files and make sure
that hanna &apos;s name is no longer connected to that bin .
then we can tell tanner that we traced
mona &apos;s laptop there .
yeah , and she &apos;ll eventually
put the pieces together that holbrook &apos;s behind this .
yeah , and if she doesn &apos;t ?
it will just boomerang back onto me .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
how are you so sure ?
hanna , this is the safest plan we &apos;ve got .
yes , safe for you guys . not for me .
hanna .
thinking about mona in that barrel
gave me nightmares .
i know . i barely slept .
and when i did , i dreamt that holbrook wallpapered
ezra &apos;s entire apartment with my letter to jackie .
i mean , i need to tell him that i wrote it .
is he back there ?
no , not yet .
he has meetings with vendors all morning .
okay , i &apos;m gonna call him .
see if i can catch him between meetings .
did you make that for ezra ?
yeah . i heard pecan &apos;s his favorite .
look , talia , i &apos;m getting the feeling
that you think he &apos;s available .
but he &apos;s not .
it &apos;s just a thank you for hiring me .
not a marriage proposal .
but i &apos;m sorry if i stepped on your turf .
oh , no . no , i &apos;m not interested in ezra .
or any guys .
so your ex is a girl ?
yeah .
by the way , he &apos;s dating one of my good friends .
so you might want to back off .
good to know .
morning .
i heard you on the phone earlier .
was that ted ?
yeah .
how &apos;d it go ?
he was understanding .
i explained to him after you &apos;ve failed at marriage once ,
it &apos;s not as easy saying yes again .
did you tell him about jason ?
no .
and i &apos;ve decided not to .
mom , last night you said he deserves to know the truth .
and i thought about it some more .
and i realized it would just cause him unnecessary pain .
yeah , well , it &apos;s gonna be worse
if he finds out from someone else .
the only people who know about it are you and jason .
and i trust that both of you will keep it quiet .
i just feel like if you do marry ted ,
i can see it being the kind of thing
that might gnaw at you over the years .
enough , hanna !
if you really want to help , forget it ever happened .
okay ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to do .
i have errands to run .
i &apos;ll see you at dinner .
i need to speak to you .
spencer .
can we please go somewhere private ?
are you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s hanna .
does this have to do with what you and caleb
were texting about last night ?
yes .
i thought we &apos;d agreed that you &apos;d stop
whatever it was you were doing .
it &apos;s not that simple , okay ?
you know that i wouldn &apos;t be here if it wasn &apos;t important .
i &apos;m really afraid that hanna &apos;s gonna do something stupid .
and i need your help . okay ?
spencer .
hey .
shouldn &apos;t you be at school ?
uh , i was just on my lunch break .
but it &apos;s almost over , so i should probably get going .
please call me soon .
oh , what &apos;s that ?
alison dilaurentis &apos; case file .
oh , brushing up on the facts before the trial starts ?
yeah .
but the facts aren &apos;t so clear .
they rarely are in murder investigations .
i think somebody might have manipulated alison &apos;s polygraph .
why would someone do that ?
to make it look like she passed .
toby , for somebody to change the results ,
they would have had to have been there
when she took the test .
that &apos;s the only way
they would know what she missed .
and the only people there were tom higgins ,
who administered the polygraph , two rosewood cops and--
detective holbrook .
careful .
don &apos;t make accusations you can &apos;t back up .
i &apos;m not making accusations .
i &apos;m just saying it &apos;s a possibility .
why would holbrook help alison ?
people saw them kissing at the ice ball dance .
people ?
you mean your high school girlfriend ?
i looked into holbrook .
he &apos;s not taking care of his father .
his father isn &apos;t even sick .
you have been a cop for all of 6 minutes ,
and you have the nerve to investigate your superior ?
if you want to keep your job ,
your little research project ends here .
i came as soon as i heard . is everything okay ?
yeah , everything &apos;s fine .
i just wanted to ...
i just wanted to tell you that i got into talmadge .
that &apos;s fantastic news .
i guess jackie doesn &apos;t review every single application .
aria , talmadge is a very good school ,
and it &apos;s a big one .
it &apos;s unlikely you would ever run into jackie .
don &apos;t let her ruin this for you .
no , she won &apos;t .
look , i &apos;m so happy you told me .
and i &apos;m sorry , but i have to get back to work .
but , um , we can celebrate tonight . okay ?
okay .
okay , great .
ezra .
yeah .
um , that &apos;s not the only thing that i wanted to talk to you about .
jackie did review my application .
how do you know that ?
well , i wrote a letter to the admission &apos;s board
hoping that it would land on her desk .
and it did .
what letter ?
mission accomplished .
you erased the files ?
not erased , but corrupted .
do you want me to tell the girls ?
not yet .
what is all this ?
hanna , you can &apos;t move everything on your own .
you will get caught .
i know . that &apos;s why you &apos;re gonna help me .
no , i &apos;m not .
we agreed we weren &apos;t gonna touch anything .
no , you guys agreed .
and since i could spend the rest of my life in an orange jumpsuit ,
i think that i have the final say here .
we &apos;re never gonna pull this off .
yes , we will .
look , i found a drill bit that can break that lock .
and i already rented a van and a dolly .
what are you gonna do with everything inside the bin ?
we &apos;ll burn the clothes and personal items .
and the barrel ?
we &apos;ll roll it into the woods somewhere ,
and then we &apos;ll call the police with a burner phone .
no . they &apos;ll trace your tire tracks .
i won &apos;t drive on any dirt roads .
hanna , you &apos;re not a forensic expert . okay ?
you cannot possibly know everything that you need
to do to avoid leaving a trace .
look , alison has gone through a lot of trouble
to pin this on me .
for all i know she could have stuck a wad
of my gum on one of mona &apos;s shoes .
my dna could be anywhere in there .
i have no choice but to do this .
just like you didn &apos;t when you found that knife .
this has to work .
you forgot one thing .
what &apos;s that ?
the cameras .
no wonder you got in .
i don &apos;t blame you for being furious .
it was a really stupid thing to do .
and i realized that after i did it .
i mean , i tried to get the letter back from jackie ,
but she &apos;d already read it .
it was too late . i--
aria , stop . i &apos;m not angry .
you &apos;re not ?
it &apos;s a brilliant move . jackie must have lapped it up .
oh , yeah , she definitely did .
ezra , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m sorry . really .
you did what you had to do to get in .
there was no harm done .
yes , there was .
i actually made jackie believe that i feel this way about you .
well , i don &apos;t care what jackie thinks .
only what you do . and that is all that matters .
yeah , but i didn &apos;t have to do it .
write that letter .
and i don &apos;t even want to go to talmadge .
i was just scared that if i didn &apos;t get in ,
i &apos;d be stuck here .
well , now you don &apos;t have to worry .
i reviewed the tenant contracts , made some notes .
and i organized the contractor bills .
they tend to overcharge for labor ,
so you got to watch out for that .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
do what ?
quit because of what happened the other night .
yes , i do .
look , i admit it was unexpected .
but i think unexpected is a good thing
in my life right now .
jason , i &apos;m seeing someone .
and it &apos;s serious .
how serious ?
serious enough that he proposed to me last night .
that is serious .
he was gone for 3 months .
and our relationship had been a lot of phone calls and emails .
and i was lonely .
i know what that &apos;s like .
it wouldn &apos;t be right for me to keep working for you .
i wasn &apos;t gonna stay past the end of the month anyway .
yeah .
yeah , i get it .
feel free to swing by the office this afternoon
to pick up the rest of your stuff .
i &apos;ll be out most of the day .
thank you .
wait , you don &apos;t think anyone will check the cameras ?
nobody was watching the monitors when we walked by the office .
and if they do ?
we &apos;ll deal with it then . okay ?
it &apos;s better to take that chance
than to have any of this recorded .
all right , let &apos;s get the dolly .
where you going ?
i want to see what we &apos;re dealing with first .
i can &apos;t believe you told ezra and lived to talk about it .
i know .
i mean , i wasted so much energy worrying about
how he was gonna react when i could have been
worrying about all the other things
that i have to worry about .
like hanna .
she isn &apos;t taking mine or spencer &apos;s calls .
have you talked to her ?
no . i haven &apos;t .
but hopefully , i can lure her out
of the house with a hot fudge brownie .
uh , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s an actual parking spot , spence .
the laptop &apos;s moving .
what ?
mona &apos;s laptop .
somebody &apos;s taken it out of the storage unit .
holbrook ?
my money &apos;s on hanna .
she wasn &apos;t in school today .
okay , hanna might be scared ,
but she wouldn &apos;t do something like that .
are you sure ?
there &apos;s only one way to find out .
come on .
oh , sorry .
i thought you &apos;d be gone by now .
i had some things to do before i could get over here .
i &apos;ll go . let you finish up .
that &apos;s right . i &apos;m almost done .
an engagement but no ring ?
yeah .
i haven &apos;t given him an answer yet .
he &apos;s a pastor .
and there are certain responsibilities
that go along with marrying him .
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m cut out for that life .
yeah . i bet those church socials can be pretty brutal .
i wish it was that simple .
i haven &apos;t always made the best choices .
i just wouldn &apos;t want anything i &apos;ve done to hurt him ...
or all that he &apos;s worked for .
can i ask you something ?
sure .
did saturday night happen
so that you &apos;d have an excuse to say no ?
because i &apos;ve done stuff like that before .
screwed up a good thing because i was afraid
my past was gonna get in the way .
that &apos;s not what it was , jason .
maybe not , but
i wouldn &apos;t be offended if it had been .
it wasn &apos;t . really .
take this left .
how much further ?
the gps says that we &apos;re about a mile away .
why would caleb help hanna do this ?
we don &apos;t know that he is .
they &apos;re not at hanna &apos;s house , they &apos;re not calling us back .
he &apos;s got to be helping her .
it &apos;s up ahead on the right .
hurry up .
i &apos;m going as fast as i can .
so much for being step ahead holbrook .
why would he leave the barrel ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe he thought it was too heavy to carry it himself .
we need to open it .
no , i can &apos;t look .
look , mona &apos;s body might actually be in there .
it &apos;s bad enough that she &apos;s gone ,
but if she went like this ...
okay .
but if mona &apos;s body is in there ,
we have to get it out of here .
let &apos;s get the dolly .
what is this place ?
looks like it &apos;s an old ice cream factory .
why would hanna and caleb come all the way out here
because they knew no one else would .
hanna .
caleb ?
that &apos;s got to be the wind moving stuff around .
where does the tracker say the laptop is ?
i completely lost service .
right , well , this place is huge .
we should probably split up .
yeah , i &apos;ll go check out the second floor .
okay .
which way is the exit ?
i think it &apos;s around that corner .
so you &apos;re here to rent a storage unit ?
yeah , just wanted to see what sizes they have available .
you &apos;re a little young to have accumulated so much stuff .
well , i just moved back to town .
and the place that i &apos;m staying at doesn &apos;t really
have enough room for all my things , so ...
i see .
did you know your friend was looking to rent a unit here ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
nervous about something ?
yeah . if i can make it to the bathroom in time .
i really have to pee .
oh , well , then you better get going .
do we need to wait for the manager
to show him the search warrant ?
he &apos;s on his way over now .
looks like someone &apos;s camera shy .
we &apos;re not gonna need that .
what are you gonna do with all the stuff in the bin ?
we &apos;ll burn the clothes and personal items .
and the barrel ?
we &apos;ll roll it into the woods ,
and then we &apos;ll call the police with a burner phone .
we &apos;ll never pull this off .
yes , we will .
i found a drill bit that can break the lock .
and i already rented a van and a dolly .
what are you gonna do with all the stuff in the bin ?
we &apos;ll burn the clothes and personal items .
and the barrel ?
we &apos;ll roll it into the woods ,
and then we &apos;ll call the police with a burner phone .
we &apos;ll never pull this off .
yes , we will .
i found a drill bit that can break the lock .
and i already rented a van and a dolly .
what are you gonna do with all the stuff in the bin ?
we &apos;ll burn the clothes and personal items .
and the barrel ?
we &apos;ll roll it into the woods ...
hey , sorry .
come , look at this .
we &apos;ll never pull this off .
yes , we will .
i found a drill bit that can break the lock .
and i already rented a van and a dolly .
what are you gonna do with all the stuff in the bin ?
somebody knows we &apos;re here .
it &apos;s not hanna and caleb .
let &apos;s go find emily . come on .
and then we &apos;ll call the police ...
no !
wait , what &apos;s happening ? i thought this place was shut down .
emily !
oh , my god , this is really cold .
that &apos;s liquid nitrogen .
what does that mean ?
it means that the temperature &apos;s gonna drop below zero .
and if we don &apos;t get out of here really soon ,
we &apos;re gonna freeze to death .
oh , my god .
oh , my god , it &apos;s very cold .
it &apos;s freezing .
oh , my god .
what are we gonna do ?
what do we do ?
emily !
oh , my god .
it won &apos;t budge !
emily !
emily , please .
emily .
help .
emily .
okay , hang on .
oh , my god .
hang on .
okay .
are you guys okay ?
oh , my god .
here .
oh , my god .
what &apos;s that smell ?
i &apos;m not sure .
go call the station and tell them
that we need a hazmat team .
thanks for helping me with the boxes .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a list of headhunters in the area .
it shouldn &apos;t be too hard to find someone to replace me .
thank you .
and i &apos;m sorry about what i said earlier .
i hope i didn &apos;t cross a line .
you didn &apos;t .
honestly , there &apos;s probably some truth to it .
so do you think you &apos;ll stick with the business ?
well , it &apos;s not gonna be easy working with my father .
we &apos;re not talking much right now .
and when we do , usually it just consists of him
reminding me of all the ways that i &apos;ve disappointed him .
maybe you shouldn &apos;t work with him .
you can &apos;t move forward if you &apos;re stuck in the past .
good advice .
i hope it works out for you .
you , too .
jason .
i &apos;m sorry .
this can &apos;t happen again .
hey , hanna , it &apos;s me , again .
where are you ?
call me as soon as you get this .
i didn &apos;t think anyone else was back here .
just me and my apples .
are you okay ?
yeah , yeah , i &apos;m good .
ezra just asked me to close up . so ...
i &apos;ll just wait outside .
you want to take over ?
and i &apos;ll finish cleaning up .
we both know i &apos;m not much of a cook .
oh , come on , you &apos;ll be doing me a favor .
okay .
so grab and stir .
yeah , that &apos;s all there &apos;s to it .
you have something in your hair .
what ?
what were you doing ?
running through the woods ?
oh , i just ...
i &apos;ve no idea how that got in there .
all right , well , i &apos;m gonna put some things away .
我刚才去仓库了 托比和特纳也去了
oh , my god !
hey , don &apos;t worry .
it happens sometimes .
i &apos;m so sorry . i--
no , it &apos;s nothing , trust me .
the last place i worked at ,
i almost burned the whole kitchen down .
on second thought ,
why don &apos;t you go read out in the front .
and i &apos;ll finish up here .
okay .
you didn &apos;t eat that much .
yeah , i &apos;m not that hungry .
what is this ?
something to celebrate your getting into talmadge .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s beautiful . thank you so much .
i remember how excited i was when i got accepted to hollis .
there are so many amazing adventures ahead of you .
and i don &apos;t want you to miss out on a single one ,
the way that you missed out
on so much of high school because of me .
ezra , i don &apos;t actually feel that way .
i read the letter again .
yeah , but you know i only wrote
what i thought jackie wanted to hear .
i think it rang true to her for a reason .
yeah . because i &apos;m a good writer .
i don &apos;t understand .
this morning you were practically laughing when you read it .
then i had a chance to think about it .
and i don &apos;t think you could &apos;ve written
what you did if there wasn &apos;t some small part of you
that thought that way about us .
i don &apos;t regret being with you , ezra , at all .
maybe not now , but if we stay together--
if ?
what are you-- what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying i want what &apos;s best for you .
you &apos;re approaching a very exciting time in your life .
you &apos;re going to be meeting new people .
you &apos;re going to be discovering yourself .
right . i can do all of that and still be with you .
if we stay together , you might grow to resent me .
but if you take this time for yourself ...
there will be no regrets .
promise me you &apos;ll at least think about it .
yeah , i will .
how could you tell toby about the storage unit ?
i didn &apos;t .
well , i don &apos;t believe you .
i wanted to tell him . okay ? i almost told him .
but i didn &apos;t .
well , then how come he and tanner showed up there today ?
because holbrook broke into your computer , hanna .
he recorded the conversation that you and caleb had .
he knew that you were going to the storage unit .
and he probably just tipped them off .
why wouldn &apos;t he just leave everything in there
if he and ali want to pin on me ?
i don &apos;t know .
and why didn &apos;t toby warn us ?
i don &apos;t know .
toby knew about the knife , spencer .
okay ? he knew one of us was being set up .
well , he didn &apos;t see it that way .
since when did his job become more important than his friends ?
you know , you can &apos;t blame this on toby .
we told you not to move that stuff .
you didn &apos;t listen to us .
you screwed yourself by going in there .
and you screwed over caleb , too .
wow . nice .
we need to talk about what happened tonight .
okay .
we know one or more people helped
alison kill mona and move her body .
i don &apos;t know if what we found are mona &apos;s remains .
but i do know if those drops of blood match her dna ,
your friends will be the first people i bring in for questioning .
let me remind you , you took an oath
when you became a police officer .
withholding information is not an option .
so if there is anything
that i should know ,
now is the time to tell me .
i &apos;m not even sure that this is holbrook anymore .
i mean , why would he be willing to kill for alison ?
spencer and aria almost froze to death tonight .
and i--
hanna , i got to go . i &apos;ll call you when i get home .
i &apos;m almost done . i just need to wipe down the counters .
okay .
and about your dish--
you didn &apos;t ruin it , emily .
my apple pie is now apple flambe .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m just--
i &apos;m not really myself today .
do you want to talk about it ?
not really .
i just need some sleep .
rest . you know , recharge .
have you eaten ?
not much .
well , you can &apos;t recharge on an empty stomach .
you made that for me ?
mashed potatoes always make me feel better ,
so maybe they &apos;ll do the same for you .
thank you .
i can &apos;t imagine what you must think of me .
ever since you got here i &apos;ve been a mess .
you know , first i tried to kick you out of the kitchen ,
then i broke down about my ex , and now this .
you know , i wouldn &apos;t say i &apos;m the smoothest person ,
but generally i &apos;m a little less--
neurotic ?
that &apos;s probably better than coming across like
a total control freak ,
which is how i imagine you probably see me .
no .
so the other day when
i made that comment about ezra being cute ...
yeah .
i didn &apos;t say it because i was interested in him .
i said it because i &apos;m interested in you .
i was trying to figure out if you were
into guys or girls by your reaction .
i should go finish cleaning up the kitchen .
holbrook recorded our conversation , caleb .
he knew that we &apos;re going to the storage unit .
he set us up .
he probably already sent that video to tanner .
no , if he did , we wouldn &apos;t be standing here .
well , then it &apos;s only a matter of time before he does .
okay , then we &apos;ll deal with that if it happens .
god , you told me not to touch that stuff
and i didn &apos;t listen .
i pulled you into this mess .
i &apos;m not gonna drag you down any further .
meaning ?
if holbrook shows tanner the video ,
i &apos;ll just say that i forced you to go with me .
and that you lied for me . and that it was my idea .
she &apos;s not gonna see it like that .
well , then you should stay away from me for a while .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
caleb , don &apos;t you get it ?
i &apos;m dangerous to be around right now .
if this little plan of ali &apos;s doesn &apos;t work out ,
then she &apos;s gonna think of something else .
she &apos;s not gonna give up .
then we &apos;ll both be behind bars .
maybe not at the same facility .
i &apos;m serious , caleb .
me too .
where have you been ? i &apos;ve been calling you for hours .
i &apos;m still at work .
i &apos;m buried in paperwork .
what were you doing at that storage unit ?
tanner got an anonymous call that mona &apos;s body was in there .
okay , well , why didn &apos;t you call and tell me ?
you knew that i was worried about hanna .
i found out on the drive over .
i couldn &apos;t exactly call you with tanner sitting next to me .
what was in the barrel ?
toby ?
i can &apos;t talk about it .
what do you mean , you can &apos;t talk about it ?
hanna and caleb need to know if mona &apos;s body was in there .
i got to go . tanner &apos;s calling me .
okay , well , just come over after work then .
i &apos;ll be here late .
i don &apos;t really care what time you get off .
i really need to see you .
i can &apos;t , spencer , okay . i &apos;ll call you tomorrow .
wait ...
