katrina bennett .
she comes in . she takes over .
she acts like everything is her idea .
this wasn &apos;t about a job for me .
it was about having a life .
but i guess you wouldn &apos;t understand that .
so you &apos;re gonna punish me by giving me to louis ?
because you and i are done .
you make me want to be a better man .
i can &apos;t let you do this .
i regret where we are ,
and i &apos;ve been trying to get us back to where we were .
you &apos;re suggesting bribing a man
to get you out of your bribery charge .
&quot; in for a penny , in for a pound , &quot;
mother always said .
ava hessington doesn &apos;t plead no contest .
she pleads guilty .
and you get to call it a win .
i can beat you , and i did .
you put me in that position again ,
and i &apos;ll do whatever i have to do to win .
are you saying screw this deal , let &apos;s kick his ass ?
i &apos;m saying take the deal . we already did .
i win , you back me for managing partner .
you want to take down jessica .
i do .
what time are you coming over ?
um , i thought we were doing my place .
no , because whenever i &apos;m at your place ,
all i can see is tess in a bed sheet .
i &apos;ll be there at 9 : 00 .
bran bars are forbidden to first years .
since when ?
since two seconds ago .
order of the quartermaster ,
who is no longer speaking with you .
rachel .
can you please instruct the associate to your right
to pass the nondairy creamer ?
louis , as i have been trying to tell you in person ,
and in the note i left ,
and in your voice mail ,
i &apos;m sorry .
do you know what nondairy creamer is , rachel ?
it &apos;s a metaphor .
the first sip , you think it &apos;s real , you know ?
after all , it wants you to believe
that it &apos;s genuine and it &apos;s good ,
and it &apos;s gonna deliver on its promise .
but then with time ,
you realize that it &apos;s just a concoction of chemicals
that &apos;s designed to disguise the truth
that it &apos;s actually full of shit .
then why are you drinking it ?
i &apos;m lactose intolerant .
i don &apos;t accept .
don &apos;t accept what ?
whatever bullshit apology you &apos;re here to give me .
you gave me your word ,
and the second you found out that mike
was actually gonna say yes , you couldn &apos;t stand it .
you sold me out .
i &apos;m not here to give you an apology .
i &apos;m here to give you a case .
those are the hessington oil files .
yeah , you know what , harvey ?
i don &apos;t want your sloppy seconds .
that takeover attempt &apos;s gonna be dead in the water
the second that ava hessington &apos;s settlement goes public .
tony gianopolous isn &apos;t going to just sell his shares and go away .
you &apos;re right . you know what he &apos;s gonna do ?
he &apos;s gonna leverage his position ,
and he &apos;s gonna get as much greenmail as he can .
which is exactly why i &apos;m here .
you &apos;re better suited to beat him back than i am .
you think i don &apos;t know that ?
i know you know it . i want you to know i know it .
leave the box .
louis , have you given any thought
to a rebound associate ?
harvey , come on , you know i &apos;m not that kind of guy .
come on , you have him file a few interrogatories ,
maybe pick up your dry cleaning ,
and then you cut him loose .
with no strings attached ?
better men than you have done it .
no .
yep .
who , baird ?
a week @-@ long fling i ended six days too late .
yeah , but harvey ,
i don &apos;t just want a superficial relationship , you know ?
i want a true mentee .
someone i can take to the gun club or mudding
or to the origami festival .
louis , you &apos;re gonna find the right one .
origami festival ? oh , my god .
well , this is a surprise .
what ?
i just never thought i &apos;d see the great harriet specter
making her own copies .
is that what this thing does ?
you &apos;ve never made a copy in your life before , have you ?
of course not , i &apos;m too busy being a badass
and worrying about my hair .
and your brilliant associate , michelle ross ,
does all the hard work for you anyway .
you &apos;re goddamn right she does .
i &apos;m really sorry
for what i said about having a life .
i know .
so we &apos;re good ?
we &apos;re good .
and you and mike , you &apos;re good ?
do you really think that harvey
had an emotional epiphany on his own ?
so you did forgive him ?
yes .
well , he doesn &apos;t know that .
which is why i have a triple @-@ whip , double @-@ fat ,
extra shot mocha latte with caramel .
fair enough .
but maybe it &apos;s time you told him .
so you decided not to go back to london ?
well , we have some unfinished business to discuss ,
and i thought it best to do it in person .
the takeover attempt .
tony gianopolous .
well , i &apos;ve assigned it to another attorney ,
but before you express any concern , he &apos;s excellent .
well , not only do i not have concerns ,
i &apos;m glad you &apos;ve handed it off .
and why is that ?
because that way i know you &apos;ll trust the man you &apos;re overseeing
when you come and work for me .
i have to say , i &apos;m flattered .
i don &apos;t want you to be flattered .
i want you to say yes .
as much success as i &apos;ve had with that line myself ,
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m not an oilman .
the oil business is about oil
as much as you being a lawyer is about the law .
every day is a knife fight in a prison yard ,
and something tells me you like a good knife fight .
no rules in a knife fight .
harvey , i &apos;ve just lost my number two .
i can &apos;t think of anyone better to replace him .
ava--
i &apos;m a woman who gets what i want ,
and i am willing to pay for it .
don &apos;t get me wrong , i &apos;m happy to whore myself out .
i just prefer to have more than one client .
harvey , what a coincidence .
cameron , i &apos;m surprised you can afford this place
now that you &apos;re unemployed again .
well , my temporary gig isn &apos;t over just yet .
you may think you have them fooled , cameron ,
but they &apos;ll figure you out eventually .
you didn &apos;t .
what are you talking about ?
ava hessington , you &apos;re under arrest .
what ?
on what charge ?
conspiracy to commit murder .
this is bullshit , cameron . we had a deal .
a deal where your client
admitted to bribing a foreign official .
that colonel that she paid off ?
after that , six people were killed by his troops .
i give my driver a tip , and then he runs over someone .
doesn &apos;t mean i had anything to do with it .
but if the person he hit was me ,
sure would look like that .
what the hell are you talking about ?
all six people did whatever they could
to stop your client from getting her pipeline .
if that &apos;s all you got , you don &apos;t have shit .
she did this , harvey . you don &apos;t know her .
yeah , but i know you ,
and you don &apos;t give a damn
about murder in some foreign country .
you took this case to stick it to me .
and i did .
she admitted that was a bribe
because she never thought
we would tie her to those deaths ,
and now i got her .
and you didn &apos;t see it coming ,
and there &apos;s nothing you can do about it .
what do you need me to do ?
whatever you have to to get ava out ,
because cameron &apos;s gonna try and keep her in .
you really think he &apos;s gonna try and deny her bail ?
i know it . hey , look ,
harvey , one thing .
if you have a problem defending someone
who &apos;s accused of murder , i don &apos;t want to hear it .
look , you won &apos;t , &apos; cause i &apos;m willing to do whatever it takes
to win whether she &apos;s innocent or not .
then come with me .
i &apos;m going to see ava with you ?
yep .
yeah , baby !
butch and sundance are back .
ooh , no go .
what do--what do-- what do you mean , &quot; no go &quot; ?
i mean , you &apos;re not butch or sundance .
why not ?
&apos;cause butch was the leader ,
and sundance was the gunslinger , and i &apos;m both .
okay , but sundance couldn &apos;t swim ,
and butch never shot anyone ,
so that makes you a loser .
better than a fraud .
i think it &apos;s time for some new material .
you write midnight train to georgia ,
you don &apos;t just sing it once .
and speaking of butch cassidy ,
let &apos;s go start a knife fight .
norma ,
i just want you , from now on , to just try to wear socks ,
because if you-- there isn &apos;t--
and what is that ?
hessington oil &apos;s earnings per share
and market cap growth over the last 11.2 years .
somebody ask you to do this ?
i didn &apos;t do it because somebody asked me to , louis .
i did it because i want in on the case .
you know , you realize something like this
would entail working hand in glove
and possibly even a trip or two to the mud club .
i &apos;m in .
and what makes you think you &apos;re good enough
to be my personal associate ?
i don &apos;t want to be your personal associate .
what ?
i &apos;m a fifth year .
i don &apos;t want to be anyone &apos;s personal associate ,
but i know how good you are ,
you know how good i am .
we can use each other .
like a symbiotic relationship .
like between a phytoplankton and a whale .
i &apos;m not familiar with their specific dynamic ,
but , yes , exactly .
well , katrina , i kind of had enough of being used
by associates looking to move one rung up the ladder ,
so i suggest you get the hell out of my office
and find yourself another whale .
did you know about these murders ?
i knew there was a demonstration ,
it turned ugly , and that people died .
did you know those people
were the leaders of the demonstration ?
no .
did you know the military was responsible ?
all i know about these deaths is that they happened .
on your land .
we own thousands of acres .
it &apos;s a volatile country .
people kill each other on a regular basis .
so you just chalk it up to coincidence
that the six leaders of this demonstration ,
against your company &apos;s policies ,
on your company &apos;s private property ,
were murdered ?
it was reported as a combat incident , not a murder .
you just said all you know about these deaths
is that they happened .
now you know it was a combat incident .
which one is it ?
harvey , what the hell is this ,
and who the hell does he think he is ?
mike &apos;s just doing his job .
well , mike ,
every death in that country is reported as a combat incident ,
and for your information ,
there were thousands of people opposed to our pipeline .
that &apos;s all we need right now .
would you please excuse us ?
how exactly did you manage to get your head
so far up your own ass ?
you told me to take this deal .
i did , and now here i am .
i didn &apos;t know about these murders .
what you don &apos;t seem to believe is neither did i.
we were doing our job .
cameron dennis will come at you with worse .
do you think i did this ?
that &apos;s irrelevant .
i just want to make sure i know all the evidence against you .
i have no idea what the evidence is ,
because i had nothing to do with it ,
and you say it &apos;s irrelevant , but it &apos;s not irrelevant to me .
do you think i did this ?
do you want a lawyer who thinks you &apos;re innocent and loses
or a lawyer who doesn &apos;t want to know and wins ?
you know the answer to that .
then don &apos;t ask me that question again ,
&apos;cause after i win and you &apos;re free ,
what i think won &apos;t matter .
so what did she want to talk to you about ?
she wanted to know if you were single .
listen , when you get back to the office--
wait , what do you mean ?
what do you mean , what do i mean ?
i @-@ i mean , i thought we were gonna go back together .
i don &apos;t know , i thought we could get some lunch or something .
like what ?
i don &apos;t know . like , maybe steak or something .
it &apos;s the middle of the day .
yeah , harvey , that &apos;s when people usually eat lunch .
this is about louis , isn &apos;t it ?
what ? no . maybe .
so i &apos;m supposed to take you mudding now ?
that &apos;s not the point .
look , let &apos;s just concentrate on winning this thing ,
and when it &apos;s over ,
we can talk about lunch , dinner , or anything else .
whoa , whoa , you really mean that ?
no .
butch and sundance are back .
what are you doing ?
dropping off something for harvey .
you don &apos;t have any cases with harvey .
i will when he sees what &apos;s in here .
no .
you &apos;re not taking credit for my ideas again .
harvey &apos;s gonna know i built this airplane .
harvey &apos;s not gonna know anything .
you &apos;re a little late to the party .
he and i are working together again .
i &apos;m not looking to take your place .
oh , really ?
you just happened to prepare a document for him ,
thinking he didn &apos;t have an associate ?
he &apos;s working a case that i &apos;m right for .
that &apos;s not how it works around here .
i handle all of his cases .
does harvey know that ?
what harvey knows is that i &apos;m the &quot; a &quot; team ,
and you &apos;re the &quot; b &quot; team , so you can leave the folder ,
or you can take it with you ,
but if you &apos;re looking to ride some partner &apos;s coattails ,
you &apos;re gonna have to look somewhere else .
well , the &quot; b &quot; team worked at the d.a. &apos; s office
and came up with a defense strategy
based on a specific knowledge of cameron dennis .
the &quot; a &quot; team quotes him movies .
we &apos;ll see who harvey does and doesn &apos;t value .
katrina , mike is harvey &apos;s guy .
when he tells you he &apos;s speaking for harvey ,
he &apos;s speaking for harvey .
and please don &apos;t come into this office
when i &apos;m away from my desk again .
boy , am i glad i never snuck into harvey &apos;s office
when you weren &apos;t around before .
thanks , donna .
i still expect free , exotic ,
caffeinated beverages for the foreseeable future .
cameron dennis is son of a bitch . he played us .
he slid that guilty plea right by .
i should &apos;ve seen it coming .
we should &apos;ve seen it coming .
i &apos;m the one that convinced you to take that deal .
what &apos;s done is done .
question is , what &apos;s being done ?
i &apos;m working on getting ava off these charges ,
and i got mike working on getting her out on bail .
so you &apos;re back with him .
what &apos;s the point of having a right arm without a right hand ?
good .
is it ?
what do you mean ?
i mean , he threatened you .
i &apos;ve never known you to be forgiving
with someone who threatened you .
i &apos;ve never known you to be particularly forgiving either .
um , i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;ll come back .
it &apos;s okay .
we &apos;re all good .
we &apos;re good ?
when you work with tigers ,
once in a while , they &apos;re gonna take a swipe at you .
i like working with tigers .
of course , when they get out of hand ,
you have to put them down .
now , where are we on the prep for ava &apos;s bail hearing ?
well , i was thinking ,
since cameron used the settlement to double @-@ cross us ,
why don &apos;t we use the bail hearing to double @-@ cross him ?
your honor , this is not a ponzi scheme or insider trading ,
this is cold @-@ blooded murder .
prosecution moves that bail be denied .
that &apos;s ridiculous . my client &apos;s not going anywhere .
she &apos;s got a business to run .
let &apos;s look at how she does business .
less than 48 hours ago , she admitted to bribery .
you want to talk about how she does business ?
let &apos;s talk about how you do business .
your honor , i have a list of 84 murder cases
that cameron dennis tried as a d.a.
in each instance , he allowed reasonable bail to be set .
i allowed bail because gangbangers
don &apos;t have a fraction of ms. hessington &apos;s resources .
you allowed bail because you didn &apos;t give a damn
about those guys ,
and this is personal .
it &apos;s why you took the case , it &apos;s why you hid a witness ,
and it &apos;s why you negotiated a settlement in bad faith .
my chambers now .
you bring an accusation like that into my courtroom ,
you better be able to back it up .
your honor , when i told him
he took this case to stick it to me ,
he said , quote , &quot; i did ,
and now i got her , and you didn &apos;t see it coming . &quot;
you know what , your honor ?
he &apos;s right . i am sticking it to him .
guilty as charged , just like his client .
that &apos;s enough.- okay , let me--
i am not a washing machine .
you two are not here to air your dirty laundry .
she admitted to bribing a colonel in the army ,
and that same army killed these people .
three environmentalists died in the polar ice cap .
you think she killed them also ?
maybe i &apos;ll look into that .
you gonna leak it to a corporate raider too ?
what &apos;s he talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about the fact that he leaked
this whole thing to tony gianopolous .
this is a personal vendetta ,
and he has no concrete evidence against my client .
not only do i want no bail ,
i want you to throw this case out right now .
well , i &apos;m not gonna do that .
but i &apos;ll tell you something , mr. dennis ,
i am setting bail at $ 1 .
and if you don &apos;t have any evidence ,
i &apos;m gonna hear his motion for summary judgment ,
rule in his favor ,
and this trial is going to be over before it even starts .
bloody hell .
excuse me , do you not see me sitting here ?
yeah , i saw you . i just chose to ignore you .
you must like living dangerously .
i do , and that &apos;s why stopping here ,
doing this with you , well , that &apos;s playing with fire .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with a little casual conversation .
what happens when casual conversation
becomes serious fun ?
oh , you &apos;re good .
i can promise you , i &apos;m better than good .
stephen huntley ,
senior partner , london office .
donna .
just donna ?
yeah , it &apos;s like a name and a title in one .
you &apos;ll see .
i &apos;ve heard .
secretarial pool &apos;s been buzzing
about some new , feisty ginger for a fortnight .
look , if you &apos;re trying to charm your way
into harvey &apos;s office , it &apos;s not gonna happen .
no , i &apos;m not trying to charm my way
into harvey &apos;s office .
oh , what were you trying for ?
well , actually , i was gonna try for--
donna , i need you to send louis
everything we have on tony gianopolous .
he &apos;s running point .
harvey , a pleasure . i &apos;m stephen .
i know who you are , and i know why you &apos;re here .
you &apos;re darby &apos;s fixer , and you &apos;re here to hijack my case .
did you text him whilst we were--
you said you &apos;re good ?
i &apos;m good too .
this isn &apos;t over .
is that a threat ?
you take it in whatever tone
pleases you the most .
you &apos;re right .
i am darby &apos;s fixer ,
but i &apos;m not here to hijack anything .
when i got on a plane at heathrow ,
this was still merely bribery .
i &apos;ve only just learned of the murder charges now
as i touched down .
it just means the timing changed , not the motive .
forget the bombshell the prosecution &apos;s just dropped .
let &apos;s talk about the bombshell outside your office .
donna ?
she &apos;s got a body like elizabeth hurley
and the sass of maggie thatcher .
i went out with liz .
don &apos;t sell her short in the sass department .
oh , i &apos;m well aware of her sass .
&apos;99 .
&apos;98 .
really ?
well , you &apos;re obviously a better man than i am .
don &apos;t beat yourself up . you got plenty of company .
by the way , before you say anything else ,
she can hear every word we say .
now , i &apos;ve got a murder charge to defend ,
so why don &apos;t you tell me why the hell you &apos;re really here ?
well , i &apos;m here to oversee cultural integration .
cultural integration .
standard part of the merger , been on the books for two weeks .
and why do you need me ?
well , smoothing over
these transitional periods is never easy .
it &apos;s not child &apos;s play .
you &apos;re an influencer here . people listen to you .
i want you to help them listen to me .
i get it .
you want me to pave the way for you .
here &apos;s the thing .
i don &apos;t pave the way for people .
people pave the way for me .
i get it .
steer clear of you ,
and you and i will get along just fine .
welcome to new york .
so , have you meet stephen huntley yet ?
i did .
what &apos;d you think ?
turns out we have some things in common .
turns out he didn &apos;t show up empty @-@ handed .
that &apos;s $ 1 / 2 million .
mm @-@ hmm , first dividend check of the merger .
that was my buy @-@ in amount .
maybe it wasn &apos;t such a bad idea after all .
wait a second . what was your check for ?
more than that .
1.2 ?
i &apos;m not telling .
1.5 ?
you &apos;re three times more valuable than me ?
oh , i don &apos;t think that . the check thinks that .
does the check think the only thing
that guy &apos;s here for is cultural integration ?
the check wasn &apos;t born yesterday .
he is to darby what you are to me ,
and i wouldn &apos;t send you to do that .
no , you wouldn &apos;t .
so what &apos;d you tell him ?
i told him as long as he steers clear of me , he &apos;ll be fine .
you told him wrong .
i want you to find out what the hell that guy &apos;s up to .
she &apos;s right , you know .
cultural integration &apos;s scheduled for a week .
stephen huntley booked a room at the peninsula for a month .
is it a room or a suite ? it &apos;s important .
a suite .
good work .
it &apos;s what i do .
there &apos;s only one problem .
jessica just told me to look into him one second ago .
i anticipated her needs .
no , you didn &apos;t .
i anticipated your needs ?
you anticipated your needs .
and by &quot; your needs , &quot; i mean--
okay , my needs are not the topic of this conversation .
all i &apos;m saying is , you went to the trouble of
specifically finding out he booked a suite .
save it .
can i talk to you for a second ?
not if it &apos;s about working with harvey on this case .
look , this isn &apos;t easy for me to do , but for some reason ,
you and i keep locking horns , and now i &apos;m out in the cold .
i know how i got here , but i don &apos;t know how to get back .
what do you want , katrina ?
i want to figure out a way we can coexist in this firm .
you want to know a way ?
when you see me coming , give me a wide berth .
you know what ? i &apos;m apologizing to you .
you don &apos;t have to be a dick .
i &apos;m a dick ?
you have treated everyone at this firm
below your station like shit .
now all of a sudden you want to be my best friend ?
oh , i get it .
this isn &apos;t about me and you .
this is about me and your little girlfriend .
rachel is not my girlfriend .
this has nothing to do with her , and this conversation is over .
funny how you know exactly who i was talking about .
thank you .
harvey , to what do i owe the pleasure of this lunch ?
i wanted to thank you for the check .
oh , i thought that &apos;d change your attitude .
it did .
in fact , you gave something to me ,
i want to give something to you .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a hotel bill .
i paid it . then i checked you out .
hope you left housekeeping a hefty gratuity .
you &apos;re not here to deliver checks
or make smooth transitions ,
and if you &apos;re not gonna tell me the truth ,
you don &apos;t need to be here at all .
well , that &apos;s gonna make it extremely difficult
for me to help you take over the firm from jessica .
i know about your deal with edward .
he sent me here to help .
why didn &apos;t you tell me this before ?
well , you told me miss moneypenny was listening .
i didn &apos;t know whether you wanted her to hear .
so you &apos;re here to help me take over the firm from jessica ?
what exactly does that mean ?
you know what it means .
i don &apos;t need you baby @-@ sitting me on this case .
i &apos;m not a baby @-@ sitter .
i &apos;m a fixer . i &apos;m here to help you .
now why would you turn that down ?
what &apos;s to stop you from using this
to take over the firm from me ?
i &apos;m not like you .
i don &apos;t care to have my name on the door .
so you &apos;re here just to help me .
you don &apos;t need anything in return .
your car club has a pair of
mint 1956 porsche speedsters .
you want to drive one ?
i want to race you .
harvey , fancy meeting you here .
cameron , you keep showing up unannounced ,
and i &apos;m not sure why .
i can meet you anytime , anywhere ,
because i &apos;m not afraid of you .
well , you should be .
i &apos;ve got five witnesses who place the colonel
that your client bribed at the scene of those murders .
you want evidence ? here it is .
see you in court .
we can schedule it for anytime , anywhere .
you still don &apos;t want my help ?
no , i don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t trust you .
i &apos;m not telling you to trust me .
i &apos;m telling you that this is what darby wants .
well , darby isn &apos;t here .
hey , you wanted to talk to me ?
hey , yes .
so i know you don &apos;t want me fighting your battles for you ,
and i didn &apos;t .
i just don &apos;t want you to get upset with me .
what ?
i went to talk to donna about her and me ,
and you came up .
what about me ?
that it &apos;s time for you to be accepted back .
that &apos;s why she did it .
did what ?
i caught katrina trying to horn in on my case .
again ?
yeah , i know .
donna walked in in the middle ,
and she took her to the woodshed .
so you &apos;re okay with what i did ?
i &apos;m more than okay .
not only did katrina slink away ,
but she came back later with her tail between her legs ,
looking to be my friend .
well , she is not your friend .
she &apos;s definitely not my friend .
she most certainly isn &apos;t .
what are you talking about ?
after i told her that she could take her friendship
and shove it up her ass ,
she said that this whole thing was about you
and that i was just trying to protect my girlfriend .
she called me your girl--girlfriend ?
and what did you say ?
i mean , what-- what could i say ?
we &apos;re keeping it a secret .
i @-@ i said you weren &apos;t .
good .
yeah .
am i ?
don &apos;t you know ?
well , we never really talked about it .
you mean , i &apos;ve never really asked .
nobody asks anybody anymore .
sorry .
are you okay ?
rachel elizabeth zane ,
will you be my girlfriend ?
yes .
what the hell is this ?
what ?
i &apos;m working with harvey , my best friend .
harvey gave birth to me .
when you see me coming ,
give me a wide berth , because i &apos;m a dick .
i &apos;m a dick , dick , dick .
i &apos;m working with harvey ,
my best friend ...
oh , my god .
you &apos;re not the fool anymore , louis .
mike ross is .
and i can &apos;t take it back .
i put myself out on a limb for you ,
so if you say no to me ,
i won &apos;t just be a fool .
i &apos;ll be done .
this means war .
and i am not taking any prisoners .
if you think i &apos;m staying out of it ,
you &apos;re crazy .
i don &apos;t want you out of it .
i want you in it .
so what are we gonna do ?
nothing right now .
i need to help harvey .
i don &apos;t believe it .
it &apos;s a setback , but it &apos;s going away .
and what exactly does that mean ?
i looked into three of the witnesses ,
and all three were affiliated with a guerilla faction
within the last five years .
we &apos;re gonna paint the entire incident
as a firefight between the government and armed rebels .
which , as you pointed out ,
is exactly how it was reported in the first place .
they &apos;re still placing the colonel at these murders .
i don &apos;t think you understand .
this is what i found in two hours .
in another day ...
i understand perfectly .
you want to tear these people down in court .
well , i &apos;m suggesting they never get there .
we find out how to get to them , and we pay them off .
bribery is what got you into this situation .
now you think that &apos;s your way out ?
that &apos;s what you said when i suggested that with nick ,
and i listened to you .
and i was able to neutralize him without a payoff .
you were able to get cameron dennis
to offer me a deal that &apos;s now being used against me .
and even if you can impugn these five witnesses ,
your way still goes to a verdict .
mine doesn &apos;t .
it doesn &apos;t if we don &apos;t get caught .
then don &apos;t get caught .
we &apos;re not going to get caught ,
because we &apos;re not doing this .
you told me you &apos;d do anything it takes to win .
remember that ?
you &apos;ll steal the rival pitcher &apos;s girlfriend
the night before the big game .
this is the night before the big game .
ms. hessington , what you &apos;re proposing is a crime .
a crime to get me out of a crime i didn &apos;t commit .
you said it doesn &apos;t matter whether you believe me or not .
it doesn &apos;t .
but it does ,
because if you thought i was innocent ,
you &apos;d do this .
i won &apos;t .
then you &apos;re fired .
and i &apos;ll find someone who will .
where did you get this picture ?
i friended her on facebook .
she accepted ?
not as me .
i found an intern at the d.a. &apos; s office
that she worked with two years ago
who doesn &apos;t have a facebook account .
mm . see ?
you &apos;re not the only one who can get away with fraud .
okay , step aside .
holy shit .
yeah , you do not want to get on my bad side .
i can see that .
what are you working on ?
oh , let me rephrase .
why the hell aren &apos;t you working on ava &apos;s defense ?
uh , because we got fired .
that &apos;s no reason not to work on her defense .
look , harvey ,
i know we &apos;re just getting back on the same team and all ,
and i don &apos;t want to disagree with you ,
but it &apos;s actually a very excellent reason .
wrong .
odds are cameron &apos;s expecting her to do this .
and we get a call tomorrow
to get her out of a new bribery charge .
and then whatever lawyer she replaces us with
can &apos;t stand up to cameron in court .
&apos;cause he &apos;s not gonna stop working on this .
and neither are we .
one more thing .
don &apos;t .
don &apos;t what ?
you think i don &apos;t know
what you were doing in there with rachel ?
you saw it too ?
i did , and i need you to let it go .
wait , so you &apos;re saying she threw a punch ,
and you don &apos;t want me to throw a punch back ?
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re in the middle of a murder trial ,
and i need you to let it go .
harvey , is there something you &apos;d like to tell me about ava ?
yeah , some clients can be a pain in the ass .
some ex @-@ clients too .
temporary situation .
good , good .
&apos;cause i just wanted to make sure you were still all over it .
did you want to make sure the sun was still shining
and the sky was still blue ?
i &apos;d be humble after i got fired .
if i ever got fired .
i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like in the d.a. &apos; s office now ,
but if i did what you did
to someone who was with me in the trenches ,
i &apos;d be done , like you are now .
you have no idea what the story is between me and mike .
i don &apos;t care what the story is .
you hired me , and then you hung me out to dry .
you don &apos;t give me cases . you don &apos;t give me a word .
what am i supposed to do ?
we both know how you got here .
you expect more from me ? that &apos;s not my problem .
i do know how i got here ,
which is how i know you &apos;re not gonna fire me .
so keep your empty threats to yourself .
when i said , &quot; you &apos;re done , &quot;
i meant your future at this firm is over ,
because you will never be anything
more than you are right now .
and if you ever do anything like that
to mike ross again ,
i don &apos;t give a shit what our deal was .
you &apos;ll be gone .
remember that thing we were gonna do to katrina ?
we don &apos;t need to do it anymore .
what are you talking about ?
harvey just did it .
he went to talk to her ?
he laid her out .
yeah , you don &apos;t want to be on his bad side either .
you know , we could still send her that thing .
really ?
no , actually , harvey told me not to .
so ? he &apos;s not so tough .
yeah , but we could take him .
what &apos;s he gonna do ?
talk to us with his words ?
wag a finger at us .
maybe give us a time @-@ out .
maybe even slap us with a lawsuit .
high five .
okay .
we don &apos;t need to bribe the witnesses .
we need them to sue us , right ?
the alien tort statute allows foreign nationals
to bring civil claims in u.s. court .
and then we settle .
might be a payoff , but it &apos;s a legal payoff .
and the witnesses aren &apos;t americans ,
so cameron can &apos;t subpoena them .
exactly .
good , but they need a legitimate claim ,
or we could be on the hook for bribery ourselves .
what are they suing us for ?
harvey , they witnessed multiple murders .
that would be emotionally distressing .
might even suffer from p.t.s.d.
which would prevent them from getting on the plane
and testifying in our case .
get it going .
you got a lawyer to take the other side ?
i have someone in mind ,
but we need a way to get those witnesses to go for it .
no , right now our problem isn &apos;t getting them to go for it .
it &apos;s getting to ava before she gets someone to bribe them .
hey , harvey .
i heard about what you did with katrina .
i know i asked you not to , and i wasn &apos;t going to ,
but i saw her , and i couldn &apos;t help it .
i get it .
she brings that out in people ,
but listen , just don &apos;t let it happen again .
son of a bitch .
i &apos;d call you a lying son of a bitch ,
but you were true to your word .
yeah , what word &apos;s that ?
you &apos;re not like me .
i didn &apos;t hijack your client , harvey .
oh , no , you waited for her to fire me ,
and then you swooped in with an illegal fix .
you &apos;re wrong .
you gonna look me in the eye and tell me
you didn &apos;t just meet with her about bribing those witnesses ?
that &apos;s exactly what i met with her about .
she asked me if i was willing , and i said i was .
i also told her that in this particular situation ,
it &apos;d be counterproductive .
you looked into cameron dennis .
she bribes those witnesses , he &apos;ll be lying in wait .
and that &apos;s what you told her ?
yeah , amongst other things .
you told her to stick with the lawyer
she picked in the first place ?
more or less .
harvey , listen , i told you ,
you don &apos;t have to trust me , okay ?
but darby does .
and darby wants this win .
therefore , so do i.
i &apos;m guessing you think that means that i owe you .
no , i think it means you &apos;re gonna pay me .
you look happy .
dodged a bullet .
you got ava back .
stephen got ava back . turns out he &apos;s here to help .
and you believe that ?
he got ava back .
mike &apos;s on his way over there as we speak .
mike ?
he made the call .
why not let him score the touchdown ?
and you must have someplace else to be .
blonde or brunette ?
neither .
i have to go repay a debt .
so once this is all taken care of , i wire the money .
and cameron &apos;s witnesses never take the stand .
harvey told me this maneuver was your idea .
i &apos;m not one to take credit , but , yes , it was .
he trusts you , doesn &apos;t he ?
i like to think so .
so you know how he thinks ?
what i know about how harvey thinks
is that you can never be sure what harvey &apos;s gonna think .
what do you think he thinks ?
i think that he &apos;s not really interested
in whether you did it or not .
he &apos;s interested in what the evidence is
and what we can make it say .
i want to know .
then you should ask him .
i &apos;m asking you .
i have no idea whether harvey thinks
you had those people murdered or not .
but even if i did , i would never say anything .
because he wouldn &apos;t want me to .
he &apos;s picked a good number two .
i like to think so .
what do you think ?
i think it &apos;s my job to represent you
to the best of my ability .
to say anything else would be as big a betrayal to harvey
as discussing what he thinks .
let me guess , you won the testosterone 500,
and you &apos;re here to brag .
actually , harvey took the checkered flag ,
and i &apos;m here for you .
why would i go out with a loser ?
well , losing has its benefits .
if he thinks he &apos;s a better man than me ,
then he won &apos;t get jealous .
oh , harvey &apos;s got nothing to be jealous of .
not yet .
he will be if you take a ride with me .
that could be dangerous .
yeah .
look , if you think a fancy car
and some smooth talk is all it takes to get to me ...
okay , i understand .
i &apos;m sure i can find another connoisseur of the theater
to take to macbeth .
oh , your research came up short .
i &apos;ve already seen macbeth .
not with me , not in the front row ,
and certainly not with daniel day @-@ lewis .
i &apos;m in trouble .
this is everything i have on tony gianopolous .
read it , summarize it , and make it your life .
i won &apos;t let you down .
welcome to team litt .
louis .
thank you .
here it is . fully executed settlement .
signed , sealed , delivered .
who &apos;d you get to represent the other side ?
harold gunderson .
louis &apos; whipping boy ?
yeah , he works for allison holt now ,
which is actually kind of perfect ,
&apos;cause everyone knows she would
never do anything to help us .
but i got harold the job , so ...
he owes you one .
not anymore .
what &apos;d you say ?
what ?
when ava asked if i thought she was guilty .
i told her that i had no idea what you thought .
and it was none of her business what i thought .
good answer .
what about you ?
you want to know what i think ?
i know what you think , and i think it too .
she did it .
we , uh ... we never had drinks before .
i know .
harvey , we just admitted to each other
that we &apos;re defending a murderer .
doesn &apos;t really seem like a cause for celebration .
it &apos;s not a celebration .
remember when you said butch and sundance are back ?
they weren &apos;t .
what do you mean ?
i mean it &apos;s time i told you
i made a deal with darby
to take over the firm from jessica .
