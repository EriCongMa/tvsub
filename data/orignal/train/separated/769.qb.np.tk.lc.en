to my dear friends , melissa and sadie .
five years together .
that is awesome .
hear , hear .
what is your secret ?
i don &apos;t really think there is a secret .
i think it &apos;s just about ...
love , understanding , and ...
two sets of boobs .
i love boobs . i love &apos; em .
i love ...
everything about &apos; em .
okay .
yeah , i do , too .
all different kinds .
yeah , that &apos;s my ... too .
i love them .
and the curiosity rover has touched down on the planet of mars .
what &apos;s happening right now ?
what &apos;s happening in there ?
schmidt &apos;s in there with his boss .
he &apos;s entertaining her .
i don &apos;t care what he does .
i just don &apos;t understand why he has to narrate it !
robot arm engaged !
it &apos;s just engaged now ?
so he &apos;s saying everything up to this point
has been foreplay ?
are you kidding me ? that &apos;s ridiculous .
what are you gonna do for 20 minutes of foreplay ?
boring ! yawn !
am i right , ladies ?
so , i actually know what &apos;s about to happen next .
you will all want to cover your ears .
i found water !
no , i didn &apos;t do it in time .
oh , he found ...
has anybody seen a movie in the last five months ,
and can you describe the plot in great detail and loudly ?
okay , you &apos;re dry .
actually , i &apos;m good . thank you .
come on . i spent six dollars on this wine .
i &apos;ve been looking for the right time to tell you tonight ,
but melissa and i are so excited
because ...
that is so upsetting .
what mission is this based on ? !
i &apos;m pregnant ! we are pregnant !
wha ... ?
lesbian baby . congratulations , you guys .
i feel so lucky , you know ?
like i really tucked this one in just under the wire .
what do you mean ? you &apos;re so young .
as your friendly neighborhood gynecologist ,
you should know that by the time a lady hits 30,
she loses about 90 % of her eggs .
what ?
no , th @-@ that can &apos;t be true .
what ?
did you know that there &apos;s a test that you can take that tells you how many beans
you got left in your bean sack ?
ovaries .
it estimates basically
how many childbearing years you have left .
yeah , get this baloney :
i &apos;m 32 , but my eggs are 48,
and my vagina is 97 .
i am so uncomfortable .
but it gets better with age .
it &apos;s like the vagina helen mirren .
oh , boy .
i &apos;ve got big plans for the centennial .
when can i take that test ?
who cares ?
personally , i &apos;m still on the please @-@ god @-@ i @-@ hope- i &apos;m @-@ not @-@ pregnant phase .
what am i doing here ?
you know , just clinically speaking ,
it &apos;s probably a good idea to know .
i want to take this test ! like , now .
can we take this test right now ?
morning , ladies .
and nick .
morning ?
well , i mean , i work nights now ,
so i &apos;m on an adjusted sleeping schedule .
i just woke up , here &apos;s my breakfast ,
i &apos;m going to work .
take me with you ! they &apos;re talking about vaginas !
i hate it ! take me with you !
our bodies really made something .
i feel like we brought manufacturing jobs back to america .
yeah , it was fine .
what do you mean &quot; fine &quot; ?
i broke your brain , girl .
how do i put this delicately ?
i was ...
nowhere close to finishing .
i was bored .
and cold .
that &apos;s cool . uh ...
no , yeah .
world shattered .
we &apos;ll try again . it &apos;ll be better .
the world i once lived in ... shattered .
all right , see you at work .
see you at work .
put me on the air .
i got something to say about andrewynum &apos;s hair .
all right , caller , you &apos;re up next .
look at you , man . this is great .
you &apos;re the king of your own castle .
look at this . what is this ?
why do you need so many pens , you big shot ?
i like what i do , man .
i finally feel like my life is moving in the right direction .
that is what i don &apos;t have in my life .
but not anymore .
i &apos;m gonna take one of these pens ,
i &apos;m gonna go home ,
and i &apos;m gonna write my zombie novel .
you don &apos;t think i can do it , do you ?
you know , it &apos;s not that . it &apos;s just that sometimes
i get the feeling that you ...
don &apos;t want to write .
no more excuses . i &apos;m gonna go home ,
and i &apos;m gonna write that novel .
and i &apos;ll be the first to read it .
we got a deal , friend .
deal .
yeah , you still have me on the line .
my two cents ? he &apos;s never gonna write that book .
why don &apos;t you shut up , manny from cerritos ?
okay .
who asked you ? hang up the phone .
all right .
we should go .
melissa &apos;s been drinking for two .
three .
awesome night , ladies .
educational . thank you .
sorry . i &apos;m just ...
okay . i &apos;m sorry .
what ?
sadie , before you leave , can i just ask you a few questions ?
i know where this is going .
you are a gynecologist
and a lesbian ,
which makes you ...
well , a va @-@ genius .
jar .
i know my way around a grizzly adams .
you , too ? jar .
as an adult male ,
i would like to ask you a few questions about ,
you know , the downstairs girl cookie .
jars , jars , all around jars !
this is my personal time right now .
you can make an appointment at my office ,
pay your $ 40 co @-@ pay .
i will be happy to answer your questions .
yes ! i &apos;m in . please .
now , would i have to put my legs up in the stirrups ?
why would you ?
i &apos;m asking more so out of curiosity than fear .
are you done ?
i &apos;m done . i &apos;ll see you , okay ?
i &apos;m gonna call the office .
well , thank you , guys , for the ...
awesome drunky thing and the weirdly sobering end .
look , i know sadie freaked you out
with all this talk about tests ,
but i just want to remind you that at the end of the day ,
it &apos;s all about love .
i mean , i love sadie .
i want my babies to have her beautiful face .
as long as they don &apos;t get her big , fat man @-@ feet .
yuck . fingers crossed we go donor on that one .
okay .
let &apos;s make a graceful exit , my love .
hey , get out of here ,
you crazy lesbos ,
with your baby @-@ making !
ah ! i &apos;m married . i &apos;m not dead !
see you . night .
drive safely .
90 % of our eggs , huh ?
that &apos;s crazy . i &apos;m panicking .
you panicking ?
god , no . babies wreck you , jess .
they literally eat your body .
i &apos;m 30 , i &apos;m single ,
and i just started a new job .
tonight
i used a bread roll to wipe butter off my face ,
and then i ate the bread roll ,
so i essentially used my face as a butter knife .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m ready to bring new life into the world , but ...
what if all that &apos;s left are the weird eggs ?
and the evil eggs ?
you have no evil eggs .
i can feel them . they &apos;re turning .
they watched their brothers and sisters die ,
and now they want to be birthed .
i need to be fertilized .
fertilize me , los angeles !
calm down , all right ?
you &apos;re overreacting .
i am overreacting ! you know why ?
because i want a family .
i want to give my nipples a purpose .
give my nipples a purpose !
oh , god , that was a mistake .
duck down . that was a mistake .
we &apos;re taking that test .
well , i think that you guys made
a really smart decision coming in here today .
sadie , once at a senior graduation party ,
i sat in a very hot jacuzzi for ... 12 hours .
is there any chance that i sunny @-@ side upped my eggs ?
no , jess .
oh , between the years of 1998 and 2005,
i used a lot of self @-@ tanner .
like , a lot .
is that a possibility of , um ...
do i ... okay .
nope .
here we go .
i once fell on a pommel horse ...
i &apos;m gonna call you when i get the results .
this is good .
i got nothing . this is ...
whoa , whoa , jess , what are you doing ?
that &apos;s my ketchup collection !
this fertility website says i need to get rid of anything with toxins .
did you put the microwave in the trash ?
yes .
why would you do that ?
microwaves zap things !
you can &apos;t take my microwave away !
zap my insides !
it &apos;s the only thing i love !
i can &apos;t risk it !
it &apos;s what makes burritos delicious !
i don &apos;t care !
you care about your burritos more than my children , nick ?
you &apos;re putting me in a tough spot .
friends ,
i &apos;m in a real @-@ life sex pickle .
my inability to satisfy emma has thoroughly rocked me .
i &apos;ve tried everything .
how about now ?
hold on . i &apos;m shazam @-@ ing this song .
oh , for crying out loud !
guess what i &apos;m worried about ?
this sound .
you know what that sound is ?
it &apos;s the sound of an empty uterus .
i don &apos;t need test results to tell me
that it is the grapes of wrath in there .
it is 1930s dust bowl in there , schmidt .
and they &apos;re all walking with limps .
i can top that easily .
i &apos;m having a hard time with my zombie novel .
oh , not this ...
are you literally comparing a zombie novel
to my ability to create life ?
i &apos;m a writer , jess . we create life .
ugh ! being a woman sucks !
preaching to the choir . women are the worst .
seriously , can you please stop yelling ?
all right , now , it &apos;s no big deal ,
but i &apos;m on an adjusted schedule .
sorry about this . jess has absolutely lost her mind .
i have not lost my mind !
yeah , you have .
i &apos;m just scared !
would you trust me ? you &apos;re gonna be fine .
you &apos;re gonna meet somebody and ...
you &apos;re gonna fall in love and then ...
before you know it , you &apos;re gonna ...
with who , nick ?
who &apos;s gonna ... lay a flag down
on this sweet , sweet continent ?
i &apos;ll man up . but i must warn you ,
jess-- i don &apos;t have sperms .
i have tadpoles .
of the gods .
that &apos;s right .
and i &apos;m gonna give &apos; em to you .
you can have &apos; em all , for all i care .
that &apos;s how much i love you .
i feel your pain in this situation .
i want you to have babies .
take my sperms .
no . it should be me , jess .
what ?
with your big , beautiful blue eyes
and my ... blair underwood @-@ like skin ,
we &apos;d have the most beautiful
baby the world has ever seen .
he &apos;s not wrong .
it could get into any school it wants .
to be clear , i haven &apos;t asked any of you to impregnate me .
i think it &apos;s important that that &apos;s been said .
good , &apos; cause it &apos;s definitely not me .
&apos;cause it &apos;s definitely not you .
i would love that little baby with all my heart .
even if i did show it
by picking him up from school in my underwear and ...
hitting on the crossing guard .
how &apos;s the zombie novel coming ?
good , good , good .
i haven &apos;t written a word .
wait , are you serious ?
nick , it &apos;s not that hard , man .
just sit down and write .
you ain &apos;t hemingway .
you boys are right .
i got to be more like hemingway .
i just lost another one of my eggs
while you were comparing yourself
to the most famous writer of all time .
maybe the reason i have writer &apos;s block
is i &apos;ve been living too casual with you clowns .
i need real @-@ life adventure
like ernest hemingway had at my age .
man , i got to run with the bulls .
i got to kill a man with my bare hands
after making sweet love to him
and then sleep on the warm belly of his horse .
i got to eat my way out of a sandwich house !
how much you know about hemingway ?
not a lot ! but i &apos;m gonna learn !
i &apos;m becoming ernest hemingway .
you idiots .
schmidt .
okay , schmidt .
female pleasure .
here are some diagrams ,
so we can see where you &apos;re at .
the vagina .
i &apos;m familiar .
good .
now , what i typically do is i start over here ,
and then i move here once
i feel confident that this area
has been taken care of .
yeah , see , that &apos;s exactly what i do .
i call that &quot; losing nemo . &quot;
well , a more advanced move would be ...
you know what ? i &apos;ll just show you .
it &apos;s sort of ... come in this way .
no , no , i see what you &apos;re doing . that asymmetry right there ?
that &apos;s crucial . &apos; cause then what i &apos;ll do is
is i &apos;ll go outside ,
get the paper ,
and shake the neighbor &apos;s hand .
interesting .
then what i &apos;ll do is ,
i &apos;ll tie a bow on it because it &apos;s birthday time .
then i get onstage and collect my oscar
and say thank you to the people ,
thank you to the people , then get back down offstage
and get everybody into the sharing circle ,
right down there in the sharing circle , and then ...
spike the volleyball .
then what i like to do is ,
i like to arrive at the bridge , meet the troll ,
and then answer his riddles three .
then what we do is , we &apos;re dancing .
we &apos;re just gonna dance , we &apos;re gonna dance for a while .
we &apos;ll dance until you can &apos;t dance anymore ,
dancing till you can &apos;t dance anymore ,
and then everybody gets
a churro .
you okay ?
it &apos;s the baby hormones .
they are not as gay as me .
so i &apos;m good at this , right ?
schmidt , in my professional opinion ,
you have definitely earned the rank of--
and i will use the phrase you coined-- va @-@ genius .
thank you , thank you so much .
i really needed to hear that , sadie .
you got to go .
hey , winston ,
we &apos;re going on an adventure !
we need real @-@ life experience like hemingway .
whoo , i feel like hemingway .
this is life experience ?
yeah , the zoo is the best we can do , i told you ,
but it &apos;s got everything we need .
it &apos;s got life , animals , man , beast .
look , i &apos;m sorry , dude , it &apos;s just , you know ,
i &apos;m not supposed to be awake right now
because of my adjusted ...
adjusted schedule , yeah .
hey , man , 13 minutes of sleep .
honestly , nick , seriously ,
13 minutes of sleep-- that &apos;s all i got .
you &apos;re starting to look like a pillow to me .
all i can think of is , like ,
&quot; man , nick looks exactly like a pillow to me . &quot;
hmm , what &apos;d you say ?
winston , you need some sleep .
but i &apos;m out here with you .
yeah .
okay , because i love you .
thank you .
and i want you to finish your zombie book .
okay , but check out where we are .
this is experience ,
this is what &apos;s firing me up to get back to writing .
this is kind of what it &apos;s all about .
what are you doing ?
it &apos;s writer &apos;s fuel .
that &apos;s what hemingway said .
sadie , um , hey .
uh , i just , i just want you to know that i am , um , i &apos;m like--
i am okay with whatever you tell me .
i &apos;m just like ,
if you say
you &apos;ve got a year , that &apos;s fine .
if you say , like , &quot; you can have kids till you &apos;re 80 , &quot;
that &apos;s fine , too . if you say , &quot; you are barren , &quot;
um , i &apos;m , i &apos;m okay with that , too .
um , just ,
why am i the only one talking ?
just lay it on me .
what &apos;s inside my body ?
everything looks good , jess . your hormone levels are outstanding .
what ?
actually these are off the charts for someone your age .
i mean , i don &apos;t know how you &apos;re walking around with this many eggs .
i &apos;m the egg queen
i &apos;m queen of the eggs .
cece .
you know what ? maybe we should talk in private .
cece , cece .
cece , wait , do you want to talk ?
jess , you don &apos;t get it .
sadie basically just told me that if i want to have a kid ,
i &apos;ve got to start right now .
right now .
i thought i had all of this time .
i didn &apos;t want to have to think about this .
i know , i know , i &apos;m sorry .
i made you take the test .
what can i do ?
make me a guy so i don &apos;t have to worry about this .
you know what ? yes .
yeah , let &apos;s be guys just for today .
let &apos;s , let &apos;s care about stupid things ,
talk about sharks and sci @-@ fi movies
and making everything wireless .
&quot; dude , my phone is wireless , my computer is wireless .
everything &apos;s wireless , yeah . &quot;
you &apos;re a terrible guy .
&quot; come on . &quot;
no , i &apos;m the best guy .
come on , come on .
all right .
okay , how was that ?
why , though , with the &quot; eh &quot; ?
unbelie-- but i played out your most secret fantasy :
french maid handyman does ...
studio 54 ...
studio 54 busboy .
i know , it &apos;s disappointing .
i thought i killed it .
and i picked you at work because i heard you were amazing in bed .
i-- no , no , no , i am , okay , i know that i am .
i have it on good authority from my model ex @-@ girlfriend
and an actual lesbian gynecologist
that i know exactly what i &apos;m doing , so it &apos;s got to be you .
it &apos;s us-- this doesn &apos;t work .
when i got divorced i @-@ i ,
i thought i could go out there
and have all these new experiences--
the contract of sex with someone at work
who &apos;s so far beneath me , you know ,
someone basically just powerless .
i guess i have to feel something .
okay , see , i &apos;m not like that .
i don &apos;t even understand that concept .
my ex @-@ girlfriend the model-- she &apos;s a model .
i know she &apos;s a model .
we &apos;d have sex , and it was just like , i was happy , you know , i , i ...
we were connected , i wasn &apos;t thinking about anything .
what is that ?
that is love , you idiot .
that &apos;s love .
it sucks .
so , what , do i have to , i have to , like , be in love now
to have good sex ?
think about me-- i got to go out in the world
and meet people , date .
you &apos;re going to be great .
you think ?
yeah .
consider our sex contract void .
how am i gonna get the feathers off ?
i have no idea .
jess and that girl !
oh , i &apos;m so glad they &apos;re here .
so you &apos;re getting a lot of work done here , huh ?
who wins-- me versus gorilla ? go .
gorilla .
me versus gorilla .
gorilla .
no , but in a contest .
gorilla .
yeah , but in a competition .
uh , gorilla .
you don &apos;t get it .
okay , are you just drunk at the zoo right now ?
let &apos;s go look at snakes .
okay .
where are the snakes ? !
all day .
you know what ?
i don &apos;t think we should act like the guys .
jess , what am i going to do ?
what am i going to tell robby ?
you are a mexican west coast rattlesnakes ,
and they call you &quot; fang @-@ tastic . &quot;
no one ever calls me anything like that .
nick , what are you doing ? this is not life experience ;
this is procrastination at the zoo .
i don &apos;t think it is .
now , i need some sleep . i got to work tonight .
okay , congratulations , i &apos;m glad you found your passion ...
and that you love what you do .
but enough &apos;s enough .
don &apos;t throw it in my face .
is it like that , nick ?
don &apos;t throw it in my face .
nick , i got off my adjusted schedule ...
don &apos;t say &quot; adjusted schedule . &quot;
that &apos;s super annoying .
adjusted schedule .
stop saying it .
adjusted schedule .
you say it again , i &apos;m gonna let the snakes out .
adjusted schedule . let the snakes out .
i will let ...
these guys have done a pretty good job keeping it sealed .
nick , you &apos;re not a finisher .
oh , i &apos;m a finisher .
you &apos;re not a finisher at all , man .
that &apos;s why you didn &apos;t finish law school .
don &apos;t do that .
same reason why you &apos;re only three episodes into downton abbey .
there &apos;s just too many characters . it &apos;s hard to follow .
i get it , man , you &apos;re scared , and that &apos;s okay-- be scared .
just stop wasting my time because i &apos;m tired
and i need to sleep because i want to work tonight
at the job i &apos;m passionate about .
i &apos;m glad you called me , cece . i love the zoo .
you think i &apos;m like a bear ?
i mean , i kind of move like a bear ,
and i got that really long , sharp toenail
that you love so much .
randa .
it says here you &apos;re 43 .
keeping it tight , girl .
what do you think of kids ?
i love kids .
i would like to have children someday .
someday ? well , yeah , like in ten years or something .
i have a lot of eggs .
unfortunately i don &apos;t have a lot of sausage .
yeah , i shouldn &apos;t be complaining .
i &apos;ll be okay .
hey , winston .
aah , what ?
sorry to wake you .
z is for zombie .
what ?
i finished my novel .
i stayed up for 14 straight hours .
i even peed in water bottles .
we have a bathroom .
wow , you dedicated it to me .
&quot; to winston . have a nice summer .
hope to see you ag ... &quot; really ?
i just want to say right now , the black guy dies early--
his name is william--
but don &apos;t take offense ; it &apos;s a staple of the genre .
i can &apos;t take this-- too much anxiety .
i &apos;m going to my room .
hey , winston , are you reading it ?
i knew it .
i knew you &apos;d choose me to get you pregnant .
yep , let &apos;s go .
jess .
schmidt .
i think i may have been in love with cece .
you are in love with cece .
you think ?
can &apos;t believe i have to have feelings to have good sex .
i was hoping i &apos;d be dead before this happened .
hey , why are we all hanging out in my room
and sitting on my bed ?
nick , this is the worst thing i have ever read in my entire life .
you misspelled the word &quot; rhythm &quot; 38 times .
z is for zombie ?
yeah , z is for zombie .
the zombie novel .
&quot; rhythm &quot; is a tough word .
don &apos;t feel bad about that .
yeah , thanks , man .
did you get to the word search ?
i put a word search in the novel ,
but the joke &apos;s on you .
there aren &apos;t any words in there ,
so you &apos;re just gonna be staring at letters , you idiot .
but you know what ? you finished it ,
and for that , my friend , i &apos;m proud of you .
thank you , i did finish it , i finished something .
read it out loud , winston .
read it out loud .
read it out loud . read it out loud ...
okay , i &apos;ll read this damn thing ; you asked for it .
this might be humiliating .
&quot; no one in the sleepy mountain town of &apos; writhe @-@ em &apos; city ... &quot;
that &apos;s rhythm city .
... &quot; knew what the meteor meant ,
but the one thing mike jr . did have was a whole lot of &apos; rittems . &apos; &quot;
rhythm .
no , yeah .
&quot; &apos; whoa , what bit me in the face ? &apos;
mike jr . said to his dad mike sr. , who sucks . &quot;
no , it &apos;s mike sr. who sucks .
it &apos;s a major theme throughout this .
mike sr. sucks a whole bunch , much more than his neighbour rallo .
never stop reading this .
zombie zoo , zombie zoo .
zombie zoo , zombie zoo .
who let them zombies out that damn zombie zoo ?
watch your back
laura ... i guess laura is another character that he introduces ,
but that &apos;s it .
and here &apos;s a word search .
yeah , good luck here , you .
