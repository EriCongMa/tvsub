i hope you &apos;re a better father than you are a friend !
joey !

who &apos;s that annoying girl soccer player ?
mia hamm ?
mia hamm !
it &apos;s amazing .
one hand on the sheet , joe .
sorry .
hey , babe .
we got a wedding gift from bob and faye bing . they don &apos;t like us , do they ?
who says you can &apos;t get a nice punch bowl for under $ 6 ?
maybe we can take it back .
where would we return it ?
how about to the street , from the balcony ?
we can &apos;t do that . what if they come by for a visit ?
let &apos;s cross that bridge when my aunt and uncle who i haven &apos;t seen in 15 years ..
drop by unexpectedly and demand a giant bowl of punch .
why don &apos;t we just find a place for it ?
in that cabinet ?
that &apos;s for canned goods . have you forgotten everything from orientation ?
how about the closet by the bathroom ?
okay . let me do it .
no , i &apos;ll do it .
you have to relax and let me take care of things once in a while .
it &apos;s locked . you have to help me . why is it locked ?
no reason . i keep private things in there .
i &apos;ve been here a while , and i &apos;ve never seen what &apos;s in there .
what is in there ?
feminine stuff .
don &apos;t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff !
nothing in there concerns you . if you love me , you &apos;ll just let it go .
fine .
thank you .
love you .
hello , chandler . lovely day , huh ? you .
if it helps , alexandra &apos;s only been massaging her for three years .
if ! i said , if it helps .
why won &apos;t you let me massage you ?
i &apos;d be self @-@ conscious . you &apos;re my friend . i &apos;d be naked .
we lived together for years . i &apos;ve seen you naked .
that &apos;s different . we were roommates . and when ?
i &apos;m curious about the human body .
you can understand why this would be weird .
i &apos;m a professional and i &apos;m really good .
if you &apos;re uncomfortable , we can stop . give me a chance . please ?
if it means that much to you .
it does . how would you feel if you couldn &apos;t share your cooking ?
or how ross would feel if he couldn &apos;t teach us about dragons .
dinosaurs .
potato , potahto .
ross , the baby &apos;s kicking .
what ? it is ?
it &apos;s not kicking now .
although we would love to see you do that again .
when ? what happened ?
last night . i went into joey &apos;s room , and he was sleeping .
a dreamless sleep .
my god , the baby &apos;s kicking . that &apos;s great .
i wish i would have been there to feel the kicking for the first time .
i got some stuff going on if you want to feel .
i &apos;ll pass , but you look radiant .
i don &apos;t want to miss any more baby stuff . here &apos;s my pager number .
anytime anything pregnancy @-@ related happens , use it .
i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s 3 a.m. and you want ice cream .
can i get a copy of that ?
are you under the sheet ?
yes .
great , let &apos;s begin .
how &apos;s the pressure ?
it &apos;s nice . wow , phoebe , you are good .
stating the obvious , but thank you .
and it &apos;s not weird , is it ?
no .
that &apos;s right , you just enjoy .
oh , yeah !
oh , yeah !
okay .
oh , god , phoebe !
that &apos;s it ! that &apos;s it , right there !
i wasn &apos;t trying to open your closet , i swear .
monica runs a pretty tight ship here , doesn &apos;t she ? what are you doing ?
monica has a secret closet . she won &apos;t let me see it .
why not ?
i don &apos;t know ! what &apos;s she hiding ?
i don &apos;t know .
i bet it &apos;s richard .
what ?
before you say i &apos;m wrong ..
let me ask you something .
when was the last time you saw him ?
why would she keep richard in here ?
off the top of my head ..
maybe she &apos;s having her cake and eating it too .
you being the &quot; cake , &quot; richard being the &quot; too . &quot;
that was off the top of your head ?
yeah .
or ..
and here we go .
i saw a movie where there was a door . nobody knew what was behind it .
when they finally got it open , millions of bugs came pouring out ..
and they feasted on human flesh !
it wouldn &apos;t kill you to respect your wife &apos;s privacy !
stupid closet full of bugs !
joey , something feels weird and not good weird . i don &apos;t ..
when my sisters were pregnant ..
they got weird feelings and it was always nothing .
really ?
absolutely .
but we &apos;ll stop by the hospital just to be sure . i &apos;ll page ross .
rach , look at me . everything &apos;s fine . trust me . take my hand . here we go .
crushing bones !
good thing we &apos;re going to a hospital .
open it .
why &apos;d you ..
watch your feet . there &apos;s bugs everywhere .
so ?
she &apos;s fine .
she had braxton hicks contractions . mild discomfort in the uterine wall .
mild discomfort ? i take it you &apos;ve had one of these braxton thingies ?
everything &apos;s normal ?
yes .
there &apos;s no danger ?
no .
contractions can be unnerving , but she &apos;s fine .
thank you , doctor . and thank you for being nice and calm .
i wasn &apos;t calm ! i &apos;ve never been more scared in my life .
you said everything was okay .
what do i know ? i &apos;m not a doctor .
but everything is okay . i &apos;m fine .
you sure ?
yes . i got half a mind to contract that doctor &apos;s uterus .
mild discomfort ! what &apos;s he talking about ?
is everything okay ?
yes .
your page said , &quot; come to the hospital . &quot; what happened ?
something called braxton hicks contraction .
that &apos;s no big deal . most women don &apos;t feel them .
no uterus , no opinion .
what &apos;s with the candy ?
i was at the concession stand at the movies .
you went to the movies by yourself ?
mona !
i gotta go back in there .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i just gotta ..
no , really , tell me . what &apos;s up ?
look , i forgot my underwear .
thanks for bringing her to the hospital .
don &apos;t worry about it . no big deal .
but still , it should have been me . i &apos;m the dad .
here &apos;s information on braxton hicks .
thanks .
you did the right thing by bringing her in .
you &apos;ll make a wonderful father .
hey , not as good as this guy . he brought twizzlers .
there has got to be a way .
easy there , captain kirk .
do you have a bobby pin ?
yeah .
oh , no , wait . i &apos;m not a 9 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
then why do you throw like one ?
maybe monica has a bobby pin .
oh , sure , &quot; monica . &quot;
so how &apos;s the inappropriate crush on rachel coming ?
really good . i should be ready to kill myself any day now .
well , you sure found that quick .
i wish i didn &apos;t feel this way about rachel . i wish things could be normal .
i love living with her , and helping out with the baby is amazing .
but now i think ross feels left out .
when i took rachel to the hospital , the doctor thought i was the father .
you should have seen the look on ross &apos; face .
i have no idea what i &apos;m doing . for all i know , i &apos;m locking it more .
you try opening it with a credit card ?
that &apos;s a good idea .
so ross is kind of bummed , huh ?
i feel terrible .
it &apos;s not your fault .
what are you gonna do , not take her ? you &apos;re doing nothing wrong .
except for harboring love for the woman carrying his baby .
well , there is that .
richard , if you &apos;re in there , could you pass me my credit card ?
i gotta tell you , yesterday was amazing . that massage felt so good .
no , i got that .
can we make it a weekly appointment ?
okay .
you should know though , i &apos;ve raised my rates to $ 200 an hour .
okay .
i mean 500 .
what ?
600 .
what &apos;s going on ?
you make sex noises when you get massaged .
it freaked me out . after a while , i tried to hurt you . it spurred you on .
you &apos;re crazy . there &apos;s nothing sexual about the noises i make .
there &apos;s nothing sexual about this ?
oh , god !
what are you looking at ?
i mean , hi .
oh , that &apos;s why alexandra wears earplugs when she gives me a massage .
it &apos;s not because she hates enya .
this is embarrassing . i &apos;m never getting a massage again .
don &apos;t let this stop you from getting massages .
i have lots of clients that make those noises .
really ?
well , not clients . lovers .
we &apos;ll try it again . come back , and we &apos;ll work through it .
you sure ?
yes .
i guess .
great ! now , if you &apos;ll just excuse me .
so did you hear something you liked ?
hey , ross , check it out ! i learned a new trick .
you know , if you stick one hand down your pants , you &apos;re the spitting image of joey .
hey , i brought you some lunch .
oh , that &apos;s so sweet of you . oh , yum .
did you put pickles on this ?
well , yeah .
what ? what ? rach , what ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i made her tuna with pickle .
pickle ? pickle makes her sick .
giving her pickle is like giving me salad .
i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t know . you okay ?
i &apos;m fine , but someone make sure it &apos;s gone when i get out ?
i &apos;m on it !
i shouldn &apos;t be the one making her throw up .
lt could happen to anyone .
not to you . you know this stuff .
i don &apos;t know any of it and i &apos;m the father .
i wish i could be more involved , you know ?
well , if anyone is keeping score , i no longer eat tuna .
can i talk to you guys for a second ?
yeah .
what &apos;s up ?
sit down . i wanna talk about our situation .
are you breaking up with us ?
the thing is ..
because i live with rachel , i &apos;m here for a lot of stuff .
and ross is missing everything . so ..
yeah ?
you two should live together .
are you asking me to move ? you don &apos;t want me here ?
no , i love living with you . it just seems that ..
if you &apos;re gonna have a roommate , it may as well be the father .
but , joey , i don &apos;t think ross wants me to move in and disrupt his life .
or he does .
i would love to be around for you and the baby .
we can just try it , like on a temporary basis .
but it &apos;s you and me .
lt wouldn &apos;t be anything romantic .
i &apos;m dating mona . damn it , mona !
i was supposed to meet her an hour ago . what is wrong with me ?
so , what do you think ?
living with the father of the baby . it &apos;s a little conventional for us .
yeah , but hey , hey . you always have liked my building .
and there &apos;s more room . i mean , you could have a closet dedicated to shoes .
oh , you do know your audience .
i don &apos;t know . is it crazy ?
no .
joey , this is a smart idea .
well , i was due .
let &apos;s do it .
really ?
rach , that &apos;s great . that &apos;s great .
and you know what ? don &apos;t worry about any of the moving .
i &apos;ll take care of everything . in fact , i &apos;ll start right now .
ross , ross . mona ?
unbelievable .
not too shabby . i got this all off myself ..
using my wife &apos;s tools .
oh , my god .
how did you get in there ?
you &apos;re messy .
no ! you weren &apos;t supposed to see this !
i married fred sanford .
chandler , you don &apos;t understand .
you know , how i organize everything , right ?
okay , well this is all of the stuff that doesn &apos;t fit into any category .
so you see , i &apos;m not messy .
i &apos;m just so organized that ..
okay , okay , fine ! now you know . i &apos;m sick .
no , honey , you &apos;re not sick . i don &apos;t love you because you &apos;re organized .
i love you in spite of that .
really ?
promise you won &apos;t tell anyone ?
yes .
now that i know , if i &apos;ve got extra stuff , can we share the closet ?
well .. it &apos;s just ..
i &apos;m afraid you might mess it up .
hey .
hey .
so rachel &apos;s all moved out ? how you taking it ?
i wanted to have a few beers ..
but i got rid of those because rachel couldn &apos;t stand the smell .
i have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium .
it &apos;s a couple weeks past its expiration date , so it &apos;s got a bit of a kick .
are you okay ?
you kidding me ? yeah , i &apos;m great .
i &apos;m better than great . i am good .
now that she &apos;s gone , i can do stuff around here that i couldn &apos;t do before .
like ..
i can walk around naked again .
i can ..
i can watch porn in the living room .
this is good for me .
i like being on my own . i &apos;m better off this way .
i &apos;m a lone wolf .
a loner . alone .
all alone . forever .
what &apos;s a wolf gotta do to get a hug around here ?
that &apos;s it , just relax .
come on , more .
oh , god !
you like that , don &apos;t you ?
yeah , right there .
want it there ? take it there , baby .
phoebe ?
yeah , say my name . say it .
and now i &apos;m going to cover you back up .
