all right , i &apos;m ready for my next question .
in a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets ,
who wins the second world war ?
uganda .
defend .
kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses .
a central african power block is formed ,
colonizing north africa and europe .
when war breaks out , no one can afford the luxury of a rhino .
kenya withers , uganda triumphs .
correct .
my turn .
in a world where a piano is a weapon , not a musical instrument ,
on what does scott joplin play &quot; the maple leaf rag &quot; ?
tuned bayonets .
defend .
isn &apos;t it obvious ?
you &apos;re right . my apologies .
what the hell are you guys playing ?
it &apos;s a game we invented .
it &apos;s called counterfactuals .
we postulate an alternate world that differs from ours
in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other .
it &apos;s fun for ages eight to 80 .
join us .
all right .
i like a good brainteaser .
give it a whirl .
you &apos;re in luck , this is an easy one .
in a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver ,
what food is no longer consumed ?
uh ... a blt where the &quot; b &quot; stands for beaver ?
i don &apos;t know .
leonard , be serious .
we &apos;re playing a game here .
i can figure this out . let &apos;s see .
um , well , beavers eat tree bark .
the only tree bark i know that humans consume is cinnamon .
so , i &apos;ll say cinnamon .
incorrect .
obviously , the answer is cheese danish .
what ?
in a world ruled by a giant beaver ,
mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord .
the low @-@ lying city of copenhagen is flooded .
thousands die .
devastated , the danes never invent their namesake pastry .
how does one miss that ?
this is ridiculous .
you &apos;re just making stuff up .
is he always like this when he loses ?
oh , yes .
you should &apos;ve been here for the great giant tantrum of 2008 .
you bumped the table and you know it .
perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities .
we &apos;ll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide .
i &apos;m going to my room .
very good , leonard .
but next time , don &apos;t tell us where you &apos;re hiding .
did you guys see the paper in the american physics journal on supersolids ?
it &apos;s pretty interesting .
this guy &apos;s working from a hypothesis where ...
spoiler alert ! spoiler alert .
what ?
don &apos;t ruin it for me , man .
i printed out a pdf to read on the potty .
on the potty ? what are you , five ?
it &apos;s a potty . what do you call it ?
toilet .
that &apos;s a little vulgar for the dinner table , don &apos;t you think ?
oh , and &quot; potty &quot; is okay ?
&quot; potty &quot; is innocent . &quot; potty &quot; is adorable .
what do you do in the potty , wee @-@ wee ?
if i don &apos;t have to boom @-@ boom .
greetings .
you all remember amy farrah fowler .
nice to see you .
hello .
sorry we &apos;re late .
i must take responsibility .
i had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies .
aha .
okay .
i believe she &apos;s experiencing her menses .
actually , i &apos;m not .
in order to avoid surprises , i wear them all the time .
aha .
okay .
&quot; toilet &apos;s &quot; sounding pretty good now , huh ?
hey , look , it &apos;s shamy .
shamy ?
a juvenile amalgamation of our names .
sheldon , amy-- shamy .
oh .
i don &apos;t like that . don &apos;t do that .
all righty . what &apos;s new ?
well , just recently , i learned that you refer to us as shamy ,
and i don &apos;t like that .
i got it . but what i was going for was , you know , how &apos;s your life ?
like everybody else &apos;s .
subject to entropy , decay and eventual death .
thank you for asking .
why is she not taking our order ?
i should &apos;ve warned you ,
one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense
before one can be fed here .
really ? i assumed an establishment called
the cheesecake factory would function more efficiently .
it &apos;s how they lure you in .
i believe it &apos;s called &quot; bait and switch . &quot;
okay , i &apos;m just gonna walk away ,
&apos;cause ... i don &apos;t want to be here .
so , this is nice .
first time we &apos;ve all gotten together to eat .
you &apos;re right , he &apos;s a festival of humdrum chitchat .
okay , that &apos;s all i got .
howard , you &apos;re up .
um ... tell us about your work , amy .
i doubt you &apos;d understand .
sheldon tells me you only have a master &apos;s degree .
raj , do you have any questions for amy ?
i &apos;m curious as to why we &apos;re not eating alone .
they can &apos;t function without me .
i &apos;m the social glue that holds this little group together .
you &apos;re welcome .
listen , can i talk to you about your girlfriend ?
she &apos;s not my girlfriend .
she &apos;s a girl and she &apos;s my friend ,
but there &apos;s no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva .
got it .
although , for the record , on one occasion ,
she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly
from the corner of my mouth .
it &apos;s an action we both regret to this day .
uh @-@ huh .
anyway , i &apos;m not sure she &apos;s the best fit
for our little-- how should we call it-- rebel alliance .
oh , i never identified with the rebel alliance .
despite their tendency to build death stars ,
i &apos;ve always been more of an empire man .
yeah , not my point .
i know what your point is .
you &apos;re intimidated by amy &apos;s intellect .
to that i say , buck up .
okay , let me just get right to it .
amy is judgmental , sanctimonious and frankly ...
just obnoxious .
so ?
so we already have you for all that .
are you suggesting i terminate my relationship with amy ?
no , no , of course not .
just have your relationship someplace else .
may i point out that for eight long months ,
i suffered in silence as your female companion
filled our apartment with her off @-@ key country music caterwauling ,
the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone
against her calloused feet in our living room ,
and night after night of uninformative
tv documentaries about the jersey shore .
suffered in silence ?
yes .
and i &apos;d thank you to do the same .
reall-- silence ? !
nothing makes beer taste better
than cool clear rocky mountain spring water .
where are the rocky mountains , anyway ?
philadelphia .
really ?
i thought they were out west someplace .
think about it , raj .
where did the movie rocky take place ?
philadelphia .
okay , now i get it .
so this is the plan ?
from now on ,
we &apos;re just gonna hide out in here to avoid the shamy ?
i &apos;m very comfortable here .
penny , dear , why don &apos;t you shoot another silver bullet my way ?
get one yourself .
ooh , somebody &apos;s been taking bitchy pills .
god , he &apos;s an ass when he drinks .
oh , he &apos;s an ass when he doesn &apos;t .
you just don &apos;t hear it .
think we need to start entertaining the possibility
that the shamy could go on for years .
well , if that &apos;s the case , penny will have to get satellite tv
and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place .
i thought you were going to talk to sheldon .
i did .
well , what &apos;d he say ?
well , he pointed out that he kinda sorta had to ...
put up with you .
kinda sorta had to ?
i didn &apos;t agree with him .
well , you defended me , right ?
i tried , but ...
... he made a fairly well @-@ reasoned argument .
you &apos;re not doing that right .
what ?
gimme .
no .
trust me .
no !
i do this for my mom all the time .
see ?
with the grain .
wow , that is better .
and someday , when you have varicose veins ,
i &apos;ll show you how to massage them .
oh , god , never again .
i assume by &quot; never again , &quot; you mean never again will you drink
all of penny &apos;s beer , then run down to the gas station
for a couple of 40s , a box of slim jims
and the latest issue of bombay badonkadonks .
i was homesick .
the highlight of the evening was when you showed us
your bollywood break dancing skills .
that &apos;s very offensive .
yeah , we all thought so .
oh , no .
what ?
it &apos;s john and yoko .
more like yoko and yoko .
greetings . hey .
i brought amy here
to show her some of the work i &apos;m doing .
it &apos;s very impressive , for theoretical work .
do i detect a hint of condescension ?
i &apos;m sorry , was i being too subtle ?
i meant compared to the real @-@ world applications
of neurobiology , theoretical physics is--
what &apos;s the word i &apos;m looking for ? -- hmm , cute .
are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist
like babinski could ever rise to the significance
of a physicist like clark maxwell or dirac ?
i &apos;m stating it outright .
babinski eats dirac for breakfast
and defecates clarke @-@ maxwell .
you take that back .
absolutely not .
my colleagues and i are mapping
the neurological substrates that subserve
global information processing ,
which is required for all cognitive reasoning ,
including scientific inquiry , making my research ipso facto
prior in the ordo cognoscendi .
that means it &apos;s better than his research ,
and by extension , of course , yours .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m still trying
to work on the defecating clark maxwell , so ...
excuse me , but a grand unified theory ,
insofar as it explains everything ,
will ipso facto explain neurobiology .
yes , but if i &apos;m successful ,
i will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes
in deriving a grand unified theory ,
and therefore , subsume your conclusions under my paradigm .
that &apos;s the rankest psychologism ,
and was conclusively revealed as hogwash
by gottlob frege in the 1890s !
we appear to have reached an impasse .
i agree .
i move our relationship terminate immediately .
seconded .
there being no objections ...
... the motion carries .
good day , amy farrah fowler .
good day , sheldon cooper .
women , huh ?
can &apos;t live with them ,
can &apos;t successfully refute their hypotheses .
amen to that .
hey , sheldon .
hello .
i hear you broke up with amy .
a breakup would imply she was my girlfriend .
she was a girl who was my friend
who is now a girl who is not my friend .
wow . that &apos;s like the worst country song ever .
so , how are you doing ?
regarding what ?
amy .
i don &apos;t follow .
well , breakups-- or whatever the hell this is-- can be tough .
penny , i assure you , i &apos;m fine .
my relationship with amy was purely intellectual ,
there were no emotional bonds ,
the severing of which would cause me any discomfort .
the relationship simply outlived its utility ,
and i &apos;m continuing on with my life as before .
okay . good .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;m off to buy a pussycat .
i gotta tell you guys ,
i &apos;m a little worried about sheldon .
we &apos;re all a little worried about sheldon .
no , i mean since the shamy hit a reef .
oh , i thought you were just making a generalization :
&quot; you know , i &apos;m worried about sheldon
&quot; someday setting off a low @-@ yield nuclear device
because the cafeteria ran out of lime jell @-@ o. &quot;
what does &quot; hit a reef &quot; mean ?
uh , went splitsville .
pardon ?
turned to boom @-@ boom .
i think sheldon really misses amy .
you should lend him your copy of bombay badonkadonks .
he got a cat to keep him company .
you &apos;re kidding .
he takes it everywhere :
to bed , to the bathroom .
he takes the kitty to the potty ?
i thought we discussed the p @-@ word .
don &apos;t try to change me , dude .
i am what i am .
oh , gentlemen .
hey . aren &apos;t you going to introduce us
to your little friend ?
my apologies .
raj , howard , i &apos;d like you to meet dr. robert oppenheimer .
hello . hi .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk .
okay , i get it . we &apos;re worried about sheldon .
yeah .
hey .
oh , no .
robert oppenheimer was lonely .
so you decided to get the whole manhattan project ?
yes . this is enrico fermi , richard feynman ,
edward teller ,
otto frisch
and zazzles .
zazzles ?
i was going to name him hermann von helmholtz ,
but he &apos;s so zazzy .
okay , we need to talk .
about what ?
cats , sheldon .
you &apos;re clearly upset about amy being gone ,
and you &apos;re trying to replace her with a bunch of cats .
clowder .
what ?
a group of cats is a clowder . or a glaring .
okay , yeah , fine .
it &apos;s the kind of thing you ought to know
now that we have one .
terrific . my point is , you need to face up
to what you &apos;re feeling with this breakup .
it wasn &apos;t a breakup .
a breakup would imply that amy was my girlfriend .
okay , i got it , i got it ; she &apos;s not your girlfriend .
now listen to me .
i know about loneliness .
i know about trying to replace someone with other stuff .
when i broke up with penny , i got back into my cello ,
i built a bunch of model rockets ,
i got those weightlifting gloves and that five @-@ pound dumbbell .
you didn &apos;t break up , she dumped you .
she didn &apos;t dump me .
it was mutual !
i was there . she dumped you .
okay , fine .
live with cats .
be like my aunt nancy .
she had dozens of them .
and do you know what happened after she died ? they ate her .
you don &apos;t have to sell me on cats , leonard .
i &apos;m already a fan .
all right , fellas , who &apos;s in the mood for fancy feast ?
well , that &apos;s not fancy at all .
hi , mrs. cooper . thanks for coming .
where is he ?
he &apos;s in his bedroom .
now , when you said on the phone
he broke up with a girl , you meant an actual girl ,
not something you kids whipped up in a lab ?
no , she &apos;s real .
did they sin ?
no , no , it &apos;s not like that .
it &apos;s , uh ...
i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like .
but there is something i should prepare you for .
oh , relax , leonard , i have raised that boy .
i &apos;ve seen him at his best , i &apos;ve seen him at his worst .
there &apos;s nothing he can do that &apos;ll surprise me .
hold on to that thought .
come in .
surprise .
mom , what an unexpected pleasure .
my , my , that &apos;s a powerful smell .
i &apos;d like you to meet oppenheimer , frisch , panofsky ,
feynman , weisskopf ...
yeah , i get it .
you got a lot of cats
and you gave &apos; em cute jewish names .
what are you doing here ?
leonard called .
and he said that you were pining for a young lady .
oh , that &apos;s preposterous .
i &apos;m not pining over anyone .
oh , lambchop , we can quibble what to call it ,
but i think we can both agree it &apos;s creepy .
i do not agree .
cats make wonderful companions .
they don &apos;t argue or question my intellectual authority ,
and this little guy here ,
i think you &apos;ll find to be quite zazzy .
you should have called sooner .
shelly ! dinner &apos;s ready !
coming !
no cats !
what is she doing here ?
i called her .
your mother thinks
you might be losing your mind over me .
as a neurobiologist , i was curious .
well , rest assured , i am in full possession of my faculties .
25 cats !
oh , god bless you , dear .
sheldon , sit down . let &apos;s talk .
all right , but you &apos;re not fooling me .
whenever you say we have to talk ,
it means you want me to listen .
then stop talking .
yes , ma &apos;am .
now , the reason i called amy over was
to find out what type of person she is .
and after chatting a bit ,
i have to say that while she is a
perfectly unique young woman ,
you two are definitely not suited for each other .
that &apos;s a peculiar conclusion .
by any standard , amy is more similar to me
than anyone i &apos;ve ever met .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , shelly , i can &apos;t see it .
well , whether you see it or not is irrelevant .
i can &apos;t see subatomic particles ,
but nevertheless , they &apos;re there .
excellent point .
a physics point .
touche
well , putting aside the pig latin ,
it &apos;s a good thing that
you two decided to end the relationship
so i didn &apos;t have to end it for you .
amy , after consideration ,
i believe we may have acted rashly .
i propose we resume our relationship
and attempt to resolve our differences .
i &apos;ll agree to that only if you &apos;ll stipulate
that 80 % of our difficulties were caused by you .
i &apos;ll go as high as 40 .
sixty @-@ five .
done .
you understand that moving forward ,
we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you ?
i do . i find being cast
in the role of bad girl oddly titillating .
would you like to see my cats ?
i would . i love cats .
they &apos;re the epitome of indifference .
ah , then you may find zazzles a little cloying .
i saw what you did there .
he thinks he &apos;s such a smarty pants .
he &apos;s no different from any man .
you tell &apos; em not to do something ,
certainly that &apos;s all they want to do .
if i hadn &apos;t told my brother stumpy
not to clear out the wood chipper by hand ,
we &apos;d still be calling him edward .
now , don &apos;t you move .
i &apos;ll bring over all the food .
no , no , no , i can do it .
well , isn &apos;t that sweet ?
thank you , amy .
here &apos;s your cat .
and here &apos;s your $ 20 .
next !
thank you , amy .
here &apos;s your cat .
and here &apos;s your $ 20 .
