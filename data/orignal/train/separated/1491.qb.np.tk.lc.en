hey , honey .
oh , you &apos;re just in time for breakfast .
ooh , we should probably go light on the food .
something tells me we &apos;re
not gonna want to do this on a full stomach .
i can &apos;t believe there &apos;s such a thing as autopsy camp .
there is no such thing as autopsy camp .
i had to trick luke
&apos;cause i &apos;m actually taking him to a ballroom @-@ dance class .
he &apos;s been resisting ,
but it &apos;s in his blood .
i come from a long line of dancing dunphys --
a kick line , actually .
come on , we don &apos;t want to be late ,
like the guy we &apos;re gonna see on the table .
am i right ?
of corpse you are .
hey , mom , can you take me driving ?
my test is coming up , and i really need to practice .
oh , honey , i would ,
but i &apos;ve got a big
closets and blinds union meeting today .
there is no closets and blinds union .
driving with alex is torture .
she drives so slowly .
i have to be the only parent
who slams on the imaginary gas .
hey , i &apos;m not doing anything . i guess i could take her .
great ! i &apos;ll go check the tire pressure and the fluid levels !
fun ! can &apos;t wait !
be out in a sec !
okay , my rate just went up .
all right , but this buys your time and your silence .
alex can never know how much i hate driving with her .
mm , she &apos;s in a hurry today .
oh , that &apos;s just step one of her nine @-@ point safety test .
step two is checking the horn
to make sure checking the horn didn &apos;t break the horn .
she should never drive .
forget it ! you tricked me !
i &apos;m sorry , buddy , but no son of mine &apos;s
going to high school without at least knowing
how to do a proper box step .
trust me , dancers always get the girls .
remember the great kevin bacon
from &quot; footloose &quot; ?
more like &quot; footloser . &quot;
careful !
all right , no more talking . we &apos;re doing this .
you &apos;ll thank me someday .
it gets better when you find your signature move !
they used to call me &quot; king of the dips &quot; !
why can &apos;t we just repurpose some of the stuff
from manny &apos;s party last night ?
we got half a cake left .
the balloons are fine .
it &apos;s bad enough that both my sons
have to share the same birthday .
at least they deserve their own party .
you think joe &apos;s gonna mind day @-@ old cake ?
he can &apos;t even eat it . he &apos;s got three teeth .
i &apos;ll remember that in 20 years
when you want cake .
he doesn &apos;t even know the party &apos;s for him .
he understands more than you think .
right , andy ?
who , f @-@ jo here ? he is smart as a whip .
when we play peek @-@ a @-@ boo , half the time he &apos;s ahead of me .
not exactly &quot; clash of the titans . &quot;
manny , whose coat is that ?
amy martin left it here last night after my party .
i was getting some pretty strong signals from her .
i think she did it on purpose
so she &apos;d have an excuse to come back .
or because she couldn &apos;t get out fast enough .
if she was a cartoon ,
she &apos;d have left her skin here .
what does that mean ?
that amy is out of his league .
he always does this and ends up getting hurt .
you need to talk to him .
and say what ?
tell him to go for girls he stands a chance with .
i overheard him talking to reuben .
there &apos;s some girl that really likes him ,
but of course manny &apos;s not interested in her .
he &apos;s got to go for the head cheerleader .
how do you know that amy &apos;s the head cheerleader ?
i overheard that , too .
for someone whose favorite words at the movies
are , &quot; what did he say ? &quot;
you overhear pretty good .
yes , lily , i @-@ i pinky @-@ promise
that we &apos;ll be home in time for baby joe &apos;s party .
i am . i &apos;m touching to the phone .
yeah , and butterfly kisses .
okay , okay .
little girls -- so excitable .
i was wishing they had a gazebo , and then they did !
ever since i was a little boy , i have dreamed --
dreamed of getting married in a place exactly like this .
so , what date were you looking at ?
march 28th .
that &apos;s the anniversary of our first date .
oh , wait , um , i &apos;m sorry . is this price per person ?
yes , excluding alcohol , cake , and music .
what &apos;s that -- the mennonite package ?
i think you &apos;ll find our prices are competitive .
well , i &apos;m ready to commit .
cam , cam .
i &apos;m sorry .
can -- can we have a moment , please ?
okay , well , let &apos;s hope he &apos;s not having any last @-@ minute jitters .
you &apos;re not having last @-@ minute jitters , are you ?
no , no , but it &apos;s a really large deposit ,
and i want to make sure
that we &apos;re absolutely certain about this place .
well , i &apos;m certain ,
and we &apos;ve looked at every possible venue .
and pepper was by far the least snarky
about this one .
that &apos;s true .
he doesn &apos;t throw the word &quot; adequate &quot; around lightly .
okay , okay , it &apos;s this place .
okay .
but stop being so excited , all right ?
we might be able to get the price down a little bit .
okay , okay , poker face , poker face .
yeah , now work on your poker voice .
poker voice .
so , we do like it .
we &apos;re just not sure that we love it .
yeah , we &apos;re not sure we love it .
oh , that &apos;s a relief
because someone just called .
the room is booked .
what ? !
no , no , no ! okay , wait ,
are you playing hardball ?
because we &apos;re playing hardball , too !
we love it !
oh , s @-@ sorry .
a young lady planning a sweet 16
just booked your date .
after that , we don &apos;t have another opening for ...
two months .
no .
no , it has to be on our anniversary .
wait , did tracy mccoy book this room ?
tracy mccoy &apos;s a student of mine .
okay , i may have a plan .
i am not having a wedding / &quot; hunger games &quot; -themed
sweet 16 par--
oh , you &apos;re tapping your fingers .
you really do have a plan .
well , somebody smells good .
what perfume is that ?
every perfume !
20 of the sweatiest , geekiest girls
god ever fouled this planet with
and just me dancing with all of them !
during the charleston ,
my hair got caught in one of their headgear !
wow , charleston on the first day ?
last day !
just because you &apos;re a dancer
doesn &apos;t mean i have to be one , too , cha cha cha .
damn it !
i &apos;m never gonna fall for one of your lies again .
just take me to autopsy camp .
oh , shoot . am i gonna get a ticket ?
if there &apos;s any justice ,
it &apos;ll be a big one , two , three , and four .
damn it !
license and registration , please .
absolutely . there you are .
you know one of your taillights is out ?
no , i did not . what a ding @-@ dong !
wait right here .
will do . we &apos;ll be right here .
this is what you get for lying to me .
what choice did i have ? you used to be up for anything .
now , no matter what i suggest , it &apos;s no , no , no .
it &apos;s called growing up and having your own interests ,
like the minister &apos;s daughter
in your precious &quot; footloose . &quot;
wow , using my own movie against me .
let &apos;s hear it for the boy .
please step out of the car .
oh , i believe you about the taillight .
out of the car !
okay .
i &apos;m sorry , but i have to place you under arrest .
wait , what ? !
a car registered to you
has accumulated 18 unpaid parking violations ...
all on campus drive .
oh , my god , those are my daughter &apos;s tickets !
he &apos;s got an answer for everything .
i got to take you down to the station house .
you can ride up front with me .
seriously , can &apos;t i just pay you for them now ? !
at the station house , sir .
can we at least not drive by middle earth comics
and trampoline world ? !
people look up to me in this town !
no , honey , luke &apos;s fine .
and they won &apos;t take a credit card ?
no , it &apos;s $ 1,600 , cash only .
but , honey , it &apos;s sunday .
i can only get a few hundred bucks from the atm .
sir , your time &apos;s up .
honey , just use the emergency cash , okay ?
tick @-@ tock . -uh , b @-@ but , phil --
got to go ! - no , honey --
i forgot the hiding place ! phil ?
phil has $ 1,000 hidden in the house ,
and he &apos;s made up a crazy mnemonic device
to remember the location ,
which he changes every month to stay ahead of the bad guys .
what bad guys ?
&quot; loot &quot; rhymes with &quot; coot , &quot;
which takes us to ...
this picture of your grandfather .
&quot; moola &quot; sounds like &quot; coola . &quot;
not a word .
money is in the air @-@ conditioning vent .
this will all be over soon , buddy .
just give me one last smile !
you too .
mom &apos;s already on her way with the money , okay ? don &apos;t worry !
oh , my god , i don &apos;t want to go in there !
you &apos;re going in here .
i don &apos;t want to go in here !
okay . this is where sophie works .
she &apos;s the one in the hat .
copy that .
tracy works upstairs .
we &apos;ll meet in the food court in 30 minutes . sound like a plan ?
a plan , not sure if it &apos;s a finger @-@ drumming plan .
get in there .
two of my students , tracy and sophie , bffs ,
were planning on having a joint sweet 16 together
until they got in a fight over a boy , rodney .
now tracy is planning on having her own party
at the carriage house .
our venue , our date .
so , our solution -- talk to them , patch things up
so that they have their party together again
at the original location .
friends fighting over a boy --
something we know a thing or two about .
of course , usually it &apos;s gay men , not teenage girls ,
so we will have to adjust our approach just a -- not at all .
i don &apos;t know .
uh , may i help you ?
mm , yeah , uh , sophie .
um , i &apos;m looking for something for my niece .
she &apos;s been really bummed out lately --
fight with her best friend -- so i &apos;m just --
i &apos;m trying to cheer her up .
that &apos;s so nice .
yeah , she &apos;s always saying to me ,
&quot; uncle mitch , you &apos;re so cool . you &apos;re so rad .
i &apos;m so glad i talk to you about my problems . &quot;
you know , i just -- i really get kids that age .
you know , she &apos;s -- she &apos;s almost 16 , so ...
i &apos;m almost 16 .
crazy .
tracy ?
tracy mccoy ?
mr. tucker , hi .
i didn &apos;t know you were old enough to have a job .
i didn &apos;t have a job until i was 16 .
well , i &apos;m almost 16 , so ...
crazy !
oh , my gosh , i remember back then .
my friends and i had so much fun ,
well , when we weren &apos;t arguing
about silly things like parties and ...
okay , that &apos;s a lot of mirror looking ,
and that &apos;s me saying that .
good , good .
nice cruising speed .
oh , look , there &apos;s that jogger .
now we &apos;re in the lead .
can we put the brakes on the sarcasm ?
they &apos;re worn out .
hey , mom .
haley , listen to me .
you did not pay a bunch of parking tickets ,
and now your father is in jail .
and i have to go bail him out
just as soon as i can get my hands on a giant pile of cash .
cash -- ash !
oh ! oh , god .
oh ! that was furry !
you are in so much trouble .
oh , don &apos;t you think i know that ? !
what am i gonna do ? !
you &apos;re going to get what you deserve .
a parking violation is second only to a moving violation ,
which is grounds for the loss of a driving privilege .
privilege , not a right .
oh , my god , shut up !
this is why mom pays me to drive with you !
what ?
where do you think she &apos;s calling me from --
the closet and blinds union ?
why would closet workers and blind people
even have a union together ? !
think !
excuse me , waiter .
could you please tell me about the surf and turf ?
mr. lobster says ...
&quot; it &apos;s terrible ! &quot;
while mr. cow goes ...
&quot; i think you should probably just have the pasta . &quot;
dada .
no , no , no , little man .
that &apos;s your dada right there with the drinky .
over @-@ explaining .
don &apos;t feel bad . he &apos;s just making sounds .
he may not even know what the &quot; d &quot; word means .
i &apos;m fine . he &apos;s 1 .
i &apos;ve watched him pee into his own face and smile .
hola , mi amor .
i wanted to talk to you .
what are you doing ?
i decided to top amy &apos;s little &quot; forgotten coat &quot; trick
with a romantic gesture of my own .
you see --
yes , about amy ...
i know that i don &apos;t know her ,
but she seems like some of those girls that you have liked ,
but they haven &apos;t always--
you may not know her , but i do .
i went on her facebook page ,
and i put one of her favorite things
in each of the pockets of her coat .
so when she reaches inside--
she &apos;ll find a small box of dutch chocolates .
sweet , but --
raspberry rhapsody lip gloss , anyone ?
my favorite , but i still wonder--
hello , heavenly soak bath salts .
what next will she find ? !
only a lily of the valley scented candle .
i love it !
oh , i wish she had more pockets !
&quot; bucks &quot; rhymes with &quot; nyuks &quot; --
three stooges .
damn it !
&quot; wampum , &quot; &quot; pom @-@ pom &quot; --
cheerleading costume .
come on . oh , my god , really ?
&quot; bank , &quot; &quot; sank &quot; --
novelization of the movie &quot; titanic . &quot;
then why do we keep that thing ? !
oh , phil , of course !
of course , because &quot; dough &quot; rhymes with--
i don &apos;t care .
i don &apos;t care .
hi , buddy .
who am i ?
who am i ?
come on .
he &apos;s your dad .
that &apos;s right . he &apos;s your dad .
hi , dad . hi , dad .
you can do it .
come on , say , &quot; dad . &quot;
come on .
come on !
andy !
hey . how &apos;d it go with sophie ?
i did my best , but i don &apos;t think she &apos;s ready to forgive .
oh , damn it .
i know . we &apos;re screwed .
yeah , thanks a lot , sophie .
well , tracy really was out of line .
was she ?
yeah .
or was sophie , per usual , being a big drama queen ?
drama queen ?
no , tracy was spreading rumors
that sophie &apos;s boyfriend was still into maya .
they weren &apos;t rumors .
she heard it directly from someone
who saw maya and rodney holding hands at the pier .
cam , who ? dana !
yeah , like she can be trusted .
this is aidan all over again .
mitchell , it &apos;s from tracy .
&quot; mr.tucker , thank you .
&quot; talked to sophie .
party &apos;s back on . &quot;
are you kidding me ?
oh , my gosh , you &apos;re an evil genius !
you are ! you know what ?
i give tracy a lot of credit for admitting she was wrong . i do .
yeah , even though it was sophie &apos;s fault .
no !
hmm ? what ?
they &apos;re still using our venue !
no ! are you kidding me ? !
this is so frustrating !
really ?
are you sure that &apos;s how you feel ,
or do you need a little more time to think about it ?
sounds like you &apos;re trying to make a point there .
wow , i &apos;m surprised you picked up on that so quick .
yeah , you &apos;re definitely dancing around something .
i feel like it &apos;s speed @-@ related .
yeah , we lost the carriage house because you ,
true to form ,
couldn &apos;t make a timely decision .
we were out of the room for two second--
what is this &quot; true to form &quot; business ?
28 richdale road .
oh , my god , are you kidding me ?
you hemmed and hawed over our dream house ,
and now somebody else is eating breakfast in our nook !
i needed the weekend !
i never saw myself in a ranch !
and what about las vegas
when you couldn &apos;t quite commit to the show ?
no . no , no , don &apos;t .
no , no , no , it &apos;s fine .
we &apos;ll see them next time ,
just as soon as that tiger un @-@ eats roy .
i love the sign !
uh , i &apos;m not sure .
first , i thought just a little accent of color
was all it needed , but now i &apos;m thinking balloons .
jay , what do you like better--
the accent or the balloons ?
i &apos;ve been asking myself that since i met you .
can i just say ,
i want this type of playful banter in my relationship .
as long as you say it someplace else .
good one .
what are you doing ? they &apos;re gonna be here any moment .
i &apos;ve been combing through manny &apos;s yearbook .
i found a few girls he might have a shot with .
happen to know what lisa nagel &apos;s like from the neck down ?
i didn &apos;t tell him what you told me to say .
what ? why ?
because he told me what he &apos;s going to do when amy comes here ,
and it &apos;s beautiful .
i think he has a better chance than you think .
he knows how to talk to girls .
he knows how to talk to a girl
- you .
i hope you have a recent picture of his heart .
you &apos;re gonna need it putting the pieces back together .
i &apos;ll get it !
hey , mandrake .
hi , phil . i heard about jail .
how are you doing ?
it was rough .
stayed in that cold cell
a lot longer than i needed to thanks to my lovely --
your system is ridiculous , phil .
quite simple , actually !
&quot; cheddah &quot; rhymes with &quot; hedda . &quot;
where do you rest your head on ? your pilla !
help me out , buddy .
i have no buddy .
but ... luke ?
i &apos;ll get it !
would you please just let it go ?
i did let it go immediately .
you &apos;re the one who hesitated ,
like you do with everything .
the whole way here .
dad , before you get mad , i &apos;m --
oh , we passed &quot; before i get mad &quot; hours ago
when i was sitting in solitary for your crime !
it was only solitary because no one else was in there .
you paid haley to take me driving ?
uh -- that &apos;s right .
haley told me everything !
you made up a fake union
just so you wouldn &apos;t have to be with me ? !
alex , i am so sorry .
haley , i trusted you .
good luck trusting anyone in this family ,
especially dad .
usually when i drag you kicking and screaming to something ,
you thank me afterwards .
this time , i was wrong .
what did he do ?
he lied me into a dance class .
luke , i am so sorry .
haley , you are in so much trouble !
so much trouble !
stop trying to make this her fault !
what kind of parents lie to their kids ? !
yeah , what kind of lesson is that to teach all of this ?
yeah , seriously , sometimes i want --
hey , neither one of you knows the whole story .
ah , please .
let me tell them the truth .
alex , the real reason
mom doesn &apos;t want to teach you to drive
is because she doesn &apos;t want you getting your license .
what ?
think about it .
mom driving you around is kind of her favorite time with you .
it &apos;s the only place where your nose isn &apos;t buried in a book
and she can actually talk to you .
sure , you &apos;re getting your license ,
but she &apos;s losing her little girl .
mom , is that true ?
come here .
and the only reason dad lied to you is ...
should i tell him , dad ?
fine .
dad was a huge nerd in college .
he asked mom out like 10 times , and she always said no .
finally , he said , &quot; i &apos;ll never bug you again
if you do one thing . &quot;
just one .
&quot; dance with me . &quot;
just dance .
he spun her around on the floor
and expressed himself with his body
in a way he never could with words .
that &apos;s beautiful .
mom finally saw the dad
that we all know and love .
and you wanted to give that to me ?
come here .
everybody , come for cake !
we can discuss my punishment later .
did she learn that from us ?
that can &apos;t be taught . it is a gift .
yeah , she &apos;s still doing it ,
following me around all moony @-@ eyed .
she just won &apos;t get the message .
but on the bright side , amy &apos;s on her way over .
we need to talk .
got to go , reuben .
what &apos;s up ?
it &apos;s about your love life .
a lot of people here , jay .
consider it an intervention .
now , this whole amy thing is going nowhere ,
but it sounds like you have a girl that really likes you .
now , i know it &apos;s not everything you want .
m @-@ maybe she &apos;s a little thick in the middle .
i don &apos;t know .
but why don &apos;t you give her a try ?
so you think that &apos;s the girl i should go for ?
she &apos;s obviously crazy about you .
i mean , what else do you even know about her ?
hi , manny .
well , she &apos;s 6 and related to me .
shall i go on ?
okay , that explains all the outfits
she rejected this morning .
the point remains .
you could lower your sights a little .
good , we &apos;re still talking about this .
ay , leave him alone .
when amy comes , she &apos;s going to love her coat surprise .
who &apos;s amy ?
this girl jay doesn &apos;t think is into me ,
but she left her coat here .
why else would a person do that ?
by that logic , i love denny &apos;s .
even if she &apos;s not into me right away ,
isn &apos;t it possible she could fall for me over time ?
no , there &apos;s a thing called chemistry .
people know right away .
not necessarily .
i didn &apos;t know immediately that i liked you .
well , maybe not the first minute .
one month .
a month ? yikes .
i &apos;m with manny .
some people can trust their instincts
and leap in with both feet .
others need to take their time .
okay , what cam is so subtly implying
is that he knew instantly with me
while i , as usual , took my sweet time .
well , guess what .
i knew instantly with you .
how about that ?
actually , i didn &apos;t .
okay , well , yes ,
if you count that one disastrous brunch , then --
two months .
two months ? !
mm @-@ hmm .
yikes !
well , i &apos;m in the jay camp .
when you meet the right person , bang !
that &apos;s what happened with -- how long ?
uh ... six months ?
six months -- yikes .
but you were preg-- tically engaged to me by then .
mm , nice save , dad .
wait a minute .
i thought you fell in love with him
after he danced with you .
and that was six months in .
why did it take you so long to dance with me , phil ?
i don &apos;t know , claire .
you &apos;d think i would &apos;ve gotten to it by then
since we lived together .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve been berating you about dragging your feet , and ,
and when it comes to us ,
i &apos;m even more hesitate @-@ y than --
no , no , this is great because
that makes our real anniversary
two months later when we were both sure .
we can still book the carriage house for our wedding .
oh , my gosh , are you calling them ?
yes !
yes !
although , i @-@ i am --
call them .
okay .
so , you were living with this guy the whole time ...
jay !
aww , how cute !
he wants cake !
no , no , listen , listen , listen !
what &apos;s he saying ?
jay .
jay !
he &apos;s saying , &quot; jay &quot; !
he knows me !
and that &quot; j &quot; word , that &apos;s harder to say than &quot; dada &quot; !
he &apos;s a genius . come here .
she &apos;s here !
this is it , manny !
go get her , buddy !
hey , hey , hey , listen , kid .
y @-@ you might &apos;ve been right about some people
needing a little more time before they come around .
i mean , look at peanut here .
good luck , manny .
thanks , jay .
so , it took you six months , huh , phil ?
i can do six months .
i &apos;ll be here !
i &apos;m not loving this .
his door is still closed .
what is he doing in there ?
i think we both know what he &apos;s doing in there .
he &apos;s been at it for hours .
that &apos;s how i was at his age .
he &apos;s gonna wear himself out .
you should talk to him .
i don &apos;t want to embarrass him .
so , knock first .
maybe you &apos;re right .
i don &apos;t want him doing it wrong and getting hurt .
luke ?
i &apos;m coming in .
hey , man . buddy !
dad ? ! get out of here !
don &apos;t be embarrassed , son . it &apos;s perfectly natural !
