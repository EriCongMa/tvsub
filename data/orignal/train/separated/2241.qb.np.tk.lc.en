第十五集
once upon a time , an evil queen
banished every storybook character you &apos;ve ever known
to our world .
who knows the truth
and who can break the spell ?
you don &apos;t play with the curse .
i don &apos;t understand . you &apos;re not going to kill me ?
run .
you not only lied to her . you lied to me .
what are you saying ?
that we shouldn &apos;t be together .
it &apos;s been 24 hours since kathryn went missing .
have you found anything ?
i need you to come to the sheriff &apos;s station
with me and tell me everything .
thank you .
i hope kathryn &apos;s somewhere warm ,
not out in the cold .
david ...
i think you need to start worrying about yourself
a little bit more here .
your wife is missing . you are in love with another woman .
there &apos;s this ... unexplained phone call .
i know . i know . i just ...
i can &apos;t explain why it says that .
i didn &apos;t do anything to my wife .
i &apos;m pretty good at spotting a liar .
and honestly ,
liars have better material .
now go home .
i can go ?
we don &apos;t even know if there was a crime yet .
so get some sleep .
thank you .
and , david , maybe ...
get a lawyer .
you can &apos;t be serious .
a whole year without a roof over your head ?
well , you get used to it .
plus i had the motorcycle ,
so if i didn &apos;t like a place after a while ...
ruby ?
i &apos;ve never even been out of storybrooke .
what was your favorite place ?
nepal . best people .
they have these prayer temples
carved into mountains
that are overrun with lemurs .
what &apos;s a lemur ?
ruby !
just give me a sec !
they &apos;re little animals .
and they have these eyes that reflect light ,
so at night , it looks like they glow .
ruby ! stop flirting and get over here !
who &apos;s there ?
let me in .
i &apos;m just a poor old widow . spare me .
let me in or i &apos;ll ...
yes ?
i &apos;ll huff and i &apos;ll puff and i &apos;ll blow the--
you &apos;ll huff and puff ?
i couldn &apos;t think of nothin &apos; .
obviously you thought you could flatten the house
with the power of your breath .
well , a case could be made .
shh ! granny &apos;s in the other room .
you know she doesn &apos;t like me opening the shutters .
no , she doesn &apos;t like me .
that &apos;s what i meant .
you gotta get outta here .
i know .
anywhere .
well , a blacksmith &apos;s boy can get work all over .
you &apos;d leave everyone you know ?
you &apos;d do that for me ?
i &apos;d do anything for you .
peter , watch out . your air of danger is slipping .
come out , just for a minute .
it &apos;s already dark . she &apos;d never let me .
red ! where are you ? what are you doing ?
let go .
pay the price . one kiss .
red , get in here !
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing that concerns you .
just a bunch of fools
trying to get themselves killed over a few dead sheep .
wolf took out a dozen last night .
so you called me in here to what ,
just to keep me in sight ?
good evening , red .
we &apos;re just forming up a hunting party .
you &apos;re hunting the wolf ? can i go with them , please ?
i &apos;ll be safe in a big group .
don &apos;t be ludicrous . you are staying inside
and you &apos;re keeping that hood on .
you know red repels wolves .
they &apos;re not wearing red .
they &apos;re damn fools , too .
there &apos;s only two more nights left in wolfstime .
let it take a few sheep .
now go home .
i hope they kill the wolf .
then we can have lives again .
you just want to roam around the woods
with that wastrel peter .
he &apos;s not a wastrel .
he works hard . he has plans .
oh , i am sure he does . now come on .
you know what to do .
now go to sleep , girl .
yes , granny .
i hope i don &apos;t see that boy mooning around here tomorrow .
and wear the hood !
yes , granny .
i can &apos;t believe you did that . that was humiliating .
i want you to start working saturday nights .
come on . we have an agreement about saturday night .
i want to start training you to do the books and the reorders .
business is booming lately ,
and with more money comes more paperwork .
yeah . none of that sounds good .
it &apos;s gotta be done .
is this a punishment for talking to that guy ?
if i wanted to punish you , i &apos;d have better reasons .
for one thing , you were late .
for another thing , liza ,
you dress like a drag queen during fleet week .
and you dress like norman bates
when he dresses like norman bates &apos; mother .
ruby , you &apos;re a grown woman .
you can &apos;t keep acting like some kid .
you just want me to act like you until i turn into you .
well , i am not a fossil yet , granny .
i should be out there having adventures with lemurs .
well , as long as you work here ,
you are gonna listen to me .
i didn &apos;t ask to work here .
well , then what &apos;s keeping ya ?
nothing . i quit !
did you get any sleep at all last night ?
i &apos;ll sleep with the trolls in the afterlife .
i &apos;ll get the shutters .
you go check if that wolf left the chickens alone .
yes , granny .
wear your hood !
i &apos;m sorry . i can go .
are you stealing our eggs ?
no .
not a lot .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s all right .
thank you .
it was just that , um ,
last night , there was something out there .
there was howling , and ...
i heard it , and it was so cold , so--
come on .
come with me .
everyone calls me red .
i &apos;m sn--
frosty .
frosty ? really ?
no .
it &apos;s just that someone &apos;s looking for me , so--
you don &apos;t know or trust me yet .
hey , i @-@ i get it .
i just need something to call you .
uh , margaret .
oh , no .
uh , mary .
mary .
well , then , mary ,
come on .
i just gotta bring in some water before we go in .
it &apos;ll just take a second .
what was all that howling ?
it &apos;s wolfstime . killer wolf out there .
as big as a pony but a lot more bloodthirsty .
it &apos;s been stalking the area pretty regular .
it kills cattle and-- hang on .
it sticks sometimes . could you just ...
look .
look at that .
mary . look at the water .
mary .
mary .
mary ?
is he okay ?
david ?
oh , yeah . he &apos;s a little shaken up , but he &apos;s headed home .
he &apos;s fine .
any word from kathryn ?
nothing new .
did you check with boston again ?
she &apos;s not there , mary margaret .
so we have no idea what happened to her ?
all we know is that she found out about you two ,
gave you a well @-@ deserved slap ,
and then disappeared .
&quot; well @-@ deserved &quot; ?
do you really believe that ?
no . i &apos;m just preparing you
for what everyone else is gonna think .
you two are gonna look bad until we figure the truth out .
you mean david ?
that people are going to think in order to ...
be free with me ...
some are .
and he &apos;s not doing himself any favors .
so if there &apos;s anything you could think of
to pin down his whereabouts that night--
he wasn &apos;t with me . we really were through .
sorry . no , don &apos;t need a ride .
it &apos;s awfully cold out here .
i &apos;m fine . really .
i can carry your bag . where are you headed ?
dr. whale ?
mary margaret . emma .
hello there .
hey .
i was just having a talk with ruby here .
but i should , um--
yeah . yeah , you should .
yeah .
was he bothering you ?
the day i can &apos;t handle a lech is the day i leave town ,
which this is , i guess .
you &apos;re leaving ?
i had a fight with granny .
quit my job .
you quit ?
where &apos;re you going ?
i don &apos;t know .
away .
yeah , well , buses out of town don &apos;t really happen .
and you might want a destination first .
hey , if you need a place to figure things out ,
you could always come home with us .
y @-@ y @-@ yeah .
just for a little while .
come on .
it kills our livestock !
the one thing i know
is that last night was the very last massacre .
you know , if i had stayed with that party
for another ten minutes , i , too , would be among the dead .
and when i think if i &apos;d only doubled back ,
maybe i could &apos;ve caught it in the act .
maybe i would &apos;ve been able to slay the creature .
you would not .
widow lucas .
this creature is more powerful than you can imagine .
you wouldn &apos;t have a chance .
stay inside .
hide your children .
forget your livestock .
you &apos;ve said all this before .
but i haven &apos;t said how i know .
nearly threescore years ago ,
i was a child with six old brothers--
big as oak trees ,
all of them veterans of the second ogres @-@ war ,
and my father-- the biggest of them all .
come one wolfstime , he decided to go out and take on the wolf .
a different wolf back then , of course ,
but just as fearsome .
they went out there to protect me .
i was supposed to be asleep , but i crawled out on the roof
to watch and lay down in the thatch .
they had the beast surrounded , the seven of them ,
with spears all pointed in at it .
then it started .
it was lunging--
not at the men , at the spears ,
grabbing with its teeth , breaking the shafts .
they stabbed it with the splintered end ,
but it didn &apos;t matter .
it tore their throats so fast
that not a one of them got a chance
to scream or pray ...
or say good @-@ bye .
when my father died , i tumbled from the roof ,
and i landed in the blood
in front of the wolf .
i felt its breath on my face .
then it clamped its hot jaw on my arm ,
and i rolled away .
then it looked at me with eyes
so black they weren &apos;t even there ,
and it walked away .
you ever see a wild animal just turn its back
and walk away like you don &apos;t matter ?
if this wolf is like that one ,
there is no defeating it .
it &apos;s already won just by existing in our world .
you don &apos;t kill it .
you just hide .
so your granny &apos;s kind of intense .
yeah . a bit .
i feel like a rat in a trap .
is this trap keeping you from ...
being with someone ?
how did you know ?
well , i saw some looks exchanged back there ,
and i hate to break it to you , but it wasn &apos;t subtle .
yes .
peter .
we &apos;ve been friends forever , but ...
now things are ...
well , changing .
that must be nice .
do you have someone ?
oh , no .
uh , i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s in my future .
you &apos;re lucky , red .
i know .
and we &apos;re talking about going away together .
but i don &apos;t even get any time with him .
granny &apos;s too afraid of the wolf to let me out alone .
you saw what the wolf did .
sometimes i wonder if she &apos;s right .
oh , she &apos;s right about the wolf ,
but she &apos;s wrong to use it to keep you from love .
you think that &apos;s what she &apos;s doing ?
let &apos;s kill the wolf .
hang on .
we &apos;d be heroes .
red , teams of trained hunters have been killed .
but they go at night when it &apos;s got the advantage .
if we went now , we could find it slumbering in its den
and kill it in its sleep . come on .
red , i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m going , with or without you .
but you &apos;re right .
i can &apos;t let her keep me trapped forever .
i @-@ it &apos;s you .
you okay ?
you looking for kathryn , too ?
i &apos;m looking .
she knows you didn &apos;t do anything .
emma , i mean .
she can tell when people are lying , so ...
she knows .
and i &apos;ll stand with you .
i &apos;ll tell everyone this isn &apos;t possible .
she &apos;s going to turn up somewhere .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re out here , right ?
i &apos;m looking .
david ?
david .
david !
what about that ?
that &apos;s a dog . see how small that is ?
don &apos;t look where the snow &apos;s drifted . it covers tracks .
over here .
that is a rabbit .
what we &apos;re looking for will be huge .
like a dog print , but big ,
like , 8 inches across with big , long claws .
like these ?
yes .
and those .
oh , my gods . how big is this thing ?
this was one stride ?
from here ...
to there ?
come on .
over there ,
through the brush and off towards the hill .
you &apos;re good at this .
when there &apos;s something i want ,
i &apos;m good at tracking it down .

david &apos;s in the woods .
there &apos;s something wrong with him .
he looked right through me . it &apos;s like ...
it &apos;s like he was a different person .
here &apos;s another one .
right . and then here &apos;s ...
what ?
this print-- it looks like it &apos;s ...
half @-@ wolf and half @-@ boot .
see ?
wolves don &apos;t wear boots .
no , they don &apos;t .
then it just continues like it was a man .
like it was a man and a wolf .
red , what kind of monster is this ?
so ...
yeah ?
wolfstime is once a month , on the full moon .
there &apos;s a story i heard once about a creature--
aren &apos;t we awfully close to the cottage ?
who &apos;s gone to your window , red ?
is it peter ?
red , has he been at your window ?
last night .
before the killings .
and he never joined the guys to hunt the wolf .
but i &apos;m sure he wouldn &apos;t have killed them .
he wouldn &apos;t .
but when the wolf takes over--
what about tonight &apos;s hunting party ?
they &apos;re gonna kill him .
or he &apos;s gonna kill them .
it doesn &apos;t have to be that way .
what can we do ?
tell him .
if he doesn &apos;t know , tell him .
stop him .
if he &apos;ll listen to anyone ,
if he &apos;ll believe anyone , it &apos;s you .
you think i can save him ?
i think you can save everyone .
it &apos;s gonna be dark soon .
granny will be out of her mind with worry if we &apos;re not home .
she &apos;ll go out there .
mary , this is so bad .
so do something .
you &apos;re right .
i have to .
i need a couple of grilled cheeses .
i &apos;m working over at the sheriff &apos;s station now .
sort of like a ...
like a deputy , you know ?
i guess sometimes your fate finds you .
seems kinda like you &apos;re doing the same thing you always done .
plus so much more .
those will be right up .
yeah .
tony has to unwrap the cheese slices .
i help solve crimes .
i &apos;m sure you do .
i hope you &apos;re finding what you &apos;re looking for .
i am .
you think this wolfs @-@ man is me ?
red , you know me .
i know it &apos;s not you really ,
but i think it &apos;s using your body .
wouldn &apos;t i know ?
i mean , wouldn &apos;t i wake up in the woods ?
wouldn &apos;t i remember something ?
maybe .
maybe it makes you forget .
oh , my gods .
those men .
they died .
if i did that--
forget the past . think of the future .
we can go now , peter ,
have lives .
all we need to do is tie you up during the wolfstime ,
and i know where to get rope .
no .
not rope .
chains .
just in case .
just in case you &apos;re right .
i &apos;ll show you how to rig it up so that i can &apos;t get out .
and then you need to get away from me .
no .
i &apos;m staying with you .
i &apos;ll stay with you all night
and for all the nights to come .
you &apos;d do that for me ?
i &apos;d do anything for you .
okay , kid .
don &apos;t mean to kick you out , but i gotta go see
if david &apos;s in some kind of trouble out there .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m supposed to meet my mom .
there .
nice .
you know , you can let ruby do more .
she &apos;s little red riding hood .
with the little basket ?
yeah , she seems like a badass .
she is . she just doesn &apos;t remember how cool she is
or what she &apos;s capable of .
but it &apos;s true .
hey , ruby .
hey , henry .
got your grilled cheese .
thank you .
you all right ?
i guess .
i mean , this is something i know how to do , so yay .
okay , let &apos;s pack these back up ,
and we can eat it in the car .
i need to do a little wilderness search ,
and i need your help .
i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;m just gonna screw it up .
i mean , i &apos;ll screw it up with flair , but--
no , you won &apos;t . come on .
you can do this .
this place is massive . how are we supposed to find one guy ?
shh . hey , shh . we might be able to hear him .
it &apos;s massive .
i &apos;m following the path because there are boot prints ,
so just stay close .
i shouldn &apos;t even be here . i &apos;m just gonna screw everything up .
oh , wait .
ruby .
i hear him .
really ?
yeah , really . i hear him or ... something .
i ... i mean , i know where he is . don &apos;t you ?
no .
what are you doing ?
he &apos;s over here !
ruby !
ruby ?
david ?
oh , god . come on .
david , come on . wake up .
david , wake up .
emma ?
what ? ruby ?
do you remember where you are ?
no , i ...
what the hell ?
i was--i was in your office .
did you bring me here ?
you don &apos;t remember anything since you were in my office ?
last night ?
no .
i don &apos;t .
well , he &apos;s bruised , scratched up , a little dehydrated ...
what &apos;d you expect .
he &apos;s got a cut on his head .
it &apos;s superficial .
i can refer him to dr. hopper for a mental health eval ,
but it &apos;s my opinion that whatever caused this blackout
is the same phenomenon we observed
when he came out of his coma--
moving around , acting out ,
not remembering it later .
we will figure it out .
it &apos;s so strange . i can &apos;t even believe it happened .
how functional could he be during one of these episodes ?
i mean , he talked to someone .
well , people in similar states--
even under sleep medication-- do all sorts of things--
cooking , talking , driving a car .
you want to know if i could &apos;ve made that call
or more . you ...
you want to know if i could &apos;ve ...
what , kidnapped her ?
killed her ?
now take it easy there .
no one &apos;s saying you did anything bad , david .
no , but it would explain why it didn &apos;t seem like i was lying .
i wouldn &apos;t know .
stop talking , david .
what are you doing here ?
why doesn &apos;t this man have a lawyer present ?
have you even read him his rights ?
no , because he &apos;s not under arrest . we &apos;re just talking .
right . just talking .
what are you doing here ?
mayor mills is still mr. nolan &apos;s emergency contact .
you have to be kidding me .
i thought that changed to kathryn .
well , kathryn &apos;s currently unavailable .
some people haven &apos;t found her yet .
stop trying to place blame and just find her .
there &apos;s a whole lot of maine to search , regina .
well , you covered this room .
i suggest you branch out .
sheriff &apos;s station . thank you for calling . how may i direct your--
hey , stop . it &apos;s me .
here &apos;s the thing--the last time david went for a dream walk ,
he went to the toll bridge .
you know the one ? it &apos;s a crazy hunch ,
but i want you to take my bug and go and see if he was there .
no , i could get somebody else to .
ruby , you were great out there .
i still don &apos;t know how you found him . you can do this .
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s gonna be dark out soon .
david &apos;s gonna be let out .
if there is something there , we &apos;ve gotta get there first .
we don &apos;t have time to argue .
can you do this ?
i mean , what am i even looking for ?
anything out of the ordinary .
something that doesn &apos;t belong there .
and ... if i find something ?
just follow your instincts .
you ...
can &apos;t give me a clue ...
what i &apos;m looking for ?
anything of kathryn &apos;s .
ruby ?
what &apos;s going on ?
did you find something ?
ruby ?
ruby ?
where &apos;s mary ?
come on , girl . wake up . we best bar the door .
if mary &apos;s not back by now , she &apos;ll have to take her chances .
she &apos;s in no danger .
what have you done ?
no , it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s fine .
where is she ?
she &apos;s-- well , she &apos;s with peter ,
and i know that you don &apos;t like him ,
but that &apos;s really beside the point .
you stupid , careless , ridiculous girl .
no , you don &apos;t understand .
peter isn &apos;t--
this is going to be difficult to accept .
you just have to trust me .
he &apos;s the wolf .
you think peter is the wolf ?
yes .
this terrible creature is also human .
it &apos;s okay , though .
he won &apos;t hurt her . she &apos;s got him tied up .
he &apos;s tied up ?
oh , that poor boy .
red , no .
red ! it &apos;s me .
don &apos;t . don &apos;t !
please ! red ! no !
red ! no !
red !
no .
is that what i think it is ?
yeah .
i can &apos;t look .
you okay ?
i don &apos;t know what i am .
it &apos;s gonna be all right . we can figure out what happened now .
ruby , you did good .
this is doing good ?
yeah .
it &apos;s amazing .
first you found david and now this .
i know you say you don &apos;t know what you are ,
but whatever it is ,
i gotta say , i &apos;m impressed .
don &apos;t be . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m scared out of my mind .
but you did it anyway .
you knew ?
of course i knew . her mother was one , too ,
before a hunting party killed her .
i thought maybe red didn &apos;t get it ,
but when she was 13 , it started .
i paid a wizard for that cloak .
keeps her from turning , but she doesn &apos;t wear it ,
and she &apos;s found some way out of the house .
why didn &apos;t you tell her ?
i didn &apos;t want her to have that burden .
it &apos;s a terrible burden .
that story you told ...
that was her grandfather . he marked me that night ,
then came back , found me ,
turned me .
turned you .
you &apos;re ...
granny ?
how are you tracking her ?
by smell . i still have that ,
even though the rest of it has faded away .
gods , i was a fool to think i could keep this from her .
i am a fool and i have cost so many lives .
but you didn &apos;t mean to .
that &apos;s the main thing .
is it ?
here .
a silver @-@ tipped arrow will drop her .
follow me .
we &apos;re approaching from downwind , so we have a chance .
cloak !
it &apos;s too late .
he &apos;s gone .
who &apos;s gone ?
get up , girl .
get ready to run .
what &apos;s going on ?
don &apos;t you hear them ?
we have to go .
go ? i don &apos;t understand .
no , i &apos;ll explain it later . we must hurry .
what ? i &apos;m confused . what &apos;s happened ?
where &apos;s peter ?
he wasn &apos;t the wolf .
granny ?
i was wrong to keep it from you .
but now you have to go .
red .
go .
me ?
oh , gods , it &apos;s--it &apos;s me .
red , go .
i don &apos;t want to go like this .
you have to .
no . no . no . no . no . no .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s gonna be okay .
mary , there &apos;s no time .
i know . i &apos;ll get her out of here .
you look good .
thanks .
want something for the sheriff ?
no .
is your arm okay ?
same as it is every full moon . ahh .
what are you doing here , ruby ?
you here to tell me more about your fine new job ?
i want to come back .
why ?
you were pretty mad .
i wasn &apos;t mad .
looked like mad from here .
yeah . here &apos;s the thing-- um ...
you were talking about having me do all this stuff ,
and i wasn &apos;t sure .
i @-@ i said that you wanted me to turn into you , but ...
what i meant was ...
i don &apos;t know how to be you .
yorere a tough act to follow .
and then you wanted me
to take on all this extra responsibility ,
and i ...
guess i just got ...
scared .
don &apos;t be .
you shouldn &apos;t be .
well , i am .
but it &apos;s okay .
i can do it anyway .
i sort of found someone in myself
that was more than i expected .
what about adventure ? what about lemurs ?
emma was my lemur .
did that .
found out i could do that
and also that i don &apos;t want to .
i don &apos;t want a job
where a good day means ruining someone &apos;s life .
i wanna do something that makes me happy .
somewhere i love .
look ...
just so you know ,
i wanted you to do the books and everything
so you could take over when i retire ,
own the whole place .
own it ?
sure .
i mean , who else would i give it to
but someone who loves me back ?
proud of you .
what was that ?
you heard me .
david , it &apos;s going to be okay .
really ? how do you know that ?
because i honestly can &apos;t say anything
about my actions anymore .
well , there has to be an explanation .
you &apos;re right .
but the problem is ,
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good one .
what is it ? did you find her ?
we found a box .
wait . wait . what does that mean ?
we think it ...
we think that she ...
what ?
there was a human heart inside it .
oh , my god .

no .
we &apos;re gonna send it out for some tests ,
but there aren &apos;t any other missing people .
maybe you should go .
there &apos;s more .

there were fingerprints inside the lid of the box .
i ran them through the records of everyone in town ,
and there was a match .
