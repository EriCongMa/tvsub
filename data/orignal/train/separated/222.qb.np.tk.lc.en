i found your book .
if i ever show it to anyone ,
it &apos;ll guarantee my outsider status forever .
i &apos;m sure once it &apos;s published , the author will come forward .
there &apos;s a certain someone that might actually like
the way she &apos;s painted , and i &apos;m not talking about serena .
blair , we kept us a secret
&apos;cause we were afraid there was something more .
dan and i have a real connection .
that is , until a prince came along .
being together means going against my family ,
and if i &apos;m going to take a stand ,
i need to know for certain that you feel as i do .
will you marry me ?
you are cousin charlie ?
well , wait . what about your trust fund ?
why haven &apos;t you gotten it yet ?
i have to say it was a pretty devious plan .
thank you , ivy . you played your part perfectly .
what we have is a great love .
no matter what we do and how much we fight ,
it &apos;ll always pull us in .
i should find louis and tell him it &apos;s over .
we need to talk .
when i need to tell you is--
what she &apos;s trying to say is , you have my blessing .
this is your chance at happiness .
you deserve your fairy tale .
it &apos;s taking all the power i have
to walk away from you .
but i need to let you go .
being alone is just what i need .
no boys , no bars . just a bottle of sun block
and a dozen of the best beach reads .
are you turning &quot; the beautiful and damned &quot; into a movie ?
i got an idea . we got the beautiful and the damned .
so this is not your assignment now .
i always know it &apos;s serious
when even you know you can &apos;t dull the pain .
just spin the globe and pick a point .
bachelors who don &apos;t have to answer to anybody .
what is it ?
god , you &apos;re such a swan in this light .
cut ! perfect ! print .
okay , one thing i wanted to say . that was great .
loosen up . enjoy it a little bit .
just &apos; cause you &apos;re in white tie
doesn &apos;t mean you can &apos;t be dirty and drunk .
that &apos;s how these people were back then .
you know what i &apos;m saying ? they were having a good time .
so don &apos;t make it stiff . you know , enjoy it a little bit .
uh , the &quot; new york times &quot; called and wants a quote
on the decision to set the movie
on the days of the crash of &apos; 29 .
but i told that guy i don &apos;t wanna do that
unless i first get the e @-@ mail from sue zucconi .
okay .
hi . hey , serena . how are you ?
good . how are you , david ? good to see you .
thanks .
oh , no , no . it &apos;s okay . i got it . you &apos;re busy .
but then who would answer the phones in the production office ?
i had the calls forwarded to my cell .
well , if you &apos;re hands @-@ free ,
all the better to collate the revisions
and the production team &apos;s drafts .
marshall , remember when you said
that i could observe filming one day before the shoot was over ?
shoot &apos;s not over till next week .
serena ?
thank you .
dad ! what are you doing here ?
i thought you &apos;d still be in london ,
helping jenny set up at saint martins .
oh , she and eric kicked me out
when i didn &apos;t know who sarah burton was ,
so i came back here early ,
and thought i &apos;d spend some time with you .
well , happy to have you .
yeah . i popped by cece &apos;s . this was waiting .
maybe it &apos;s important . it &apos;s from the city .
it &apos;s , uh , blair &apos;s &quot; save the date &quot; &quot;
you &apos;re not happy . you guys are still friends , right ?
yeah . friends .
wonder if she invited chuck .
if he &apos;s anywhere that fedex can reach ...
hi . i don &apos;t believe we &apos;ve met .
i &apos;m nate archibald .
and , uh , you are ?
waiting for me .
how was your nap ?
great . you were gone .
内特尼尔 · 阿齐布尔德收
it &apos;s the only time i can sleep .
why didn &apos;t you take someone with you for a change ?
anything for me ?
nope .
well , if you hear anything crazy ,
it means i &apos;m doing something right .
how does it feel to be home ?
oh , it &apos;s gonna be tough reacclimating ,
after living in a palace , how will a penthouse do ?
but maybe we should skip the wedding planning
and pull the blinds and just spend the day in bed ?
we did that all summer .
but we can &apos;t put off our parents any longer .
would a present help motivate you downstairs ?
how did you know just what i was missing ? oh !
shall i wear it to your uncle &apos;s speech
at the general assembly tomorrow ?
unfortunately , you will not be allowed inside
until you are an official member of the royal family .
consider yourself lucky .
albert &apos;s speeches are stronger than ambien .
i do consider myself lucky .
i &apos;m living a fairy tale .
but no heroine gets her happy ending
without overcoming some obstacles ,
and this wedding will be no exception .
a civil service and a religious ceremony ?
who has ever heard of such a thing ? !
our guests will be sitting
longer than a terrence malick movie .
i &apos;m you &apos;re rock .
you can count on me .
how did you guys end up here ?
and--and whose boat is this ?
this is allegra versace &apos;s .
chuck won it in a poker game in chiang mai .
he won allegra , too , but , uh , that &apos;s another story .
wow . so--so he &apos;s okay then ?
ask him yourself .
serena .
usually when you smile like this ,
you look like a creepy cheshire cat ,
but this one is real .
what is your secret ? and if it &apos;s legal , i want some .
it &apos;s not a substance . it &apos;s a state of mind . a word .
well , let me guess-- a dirty word .
&quot; yes &quot; &quot;
yes , it &apos;s a dirty word ?
the word is &quot; yes . &quot; i say it at anything .
if an opportunity presents itself , i take it .
there &apos;s nothing i won &apos;t try once , even happiness .
mm , he &apos;s very inspiring .
i &apos;ve been saying all summer he should run an infomercial .
you mock , but if someone gave me the opportunity , i &apos;d say--
yes . yeah , i think i get it .
i don &apos;t think you do .
see , you &apos;ve been working all summer
in your little assistant &apos;s job ,
driving a cart , getting coffee , sorting things .
isn &apos;t there something more you want out of it ?
actually , the producer , jane , who i really admire ,
asked me my thoughts on a scene .
and i was really excited to write something up ,
but then marshall , who &apos;s technically my supervisor ,
got wind of it and , uh ...
he wasn &apos;t a huge fan of the idea .
what , so you never did it ?
well , no , i placated marshall ,
so now jane probably thinks i &apos;m a flake .
there &apos;s still time .
go say the &quot; yes &quot; you never said .
you know what ? you--you are actually right .
and even if you are completely delusional ,
if it makes you look this good , i will find jane tomorrow ,
marshall be damned .
who wants to go with me
to make sure i actually go through with it ?
i know what you &apos;re gonna say .
daniel .
hey . i was thinking about you just yesterday , old boy .
read an advanced copy
of a story that &quot; vanity fair &apos;s &quot; running in their next issue .
reminded me of your work ,
only ... better .
who wrote it ?
that &apos;s the thing . no one knows .
totally anonymous . and everyone &apos;s talking about it .
what &apos;s the story about ?
ah , it &apos;s a little wharton and a lot wolfe .
the modern mores and misdoings of upper crust manhattan .
i thought of you because
the protagonist &apos;s name was dylan hunter , of all things .
the initials being what they are ...
i &apos;m sorry , jeremiah . i gotta--i gotta run .
i see from your list of demands , blair ...
demands ?
that you would like to have peonies in your bridal bouquet .
they &apos;re my favorite flower .
and they are very beautiful , but ...
in our country , a bride always walks with carnations .
hmm . to the nearest florist and demands a refund .
i &apos;ll be holding peonies .
aren &apos;t i , louis ?
louis ?
with you looking so beautiful ,
who will even notice the flowers ?
oh , &quot; vogue paris &quot; would like to have a photo
of you in your wedding dress for their november issue .
obviously , this is a very big deal as--
as &quot; vogue paris &quot; is perhaps
the best thing to happen to the world ever .
well , i know this is very short notice ,
but not to worry ,
because my dress is already on the plane here .
your dress ?
everybody has been married in this dress ,
from my great @-@ grandmother on down .
louis , i &apos;ve already lost
on the food , the flowers , and the font .
you know how important choosing my dress is for me .
but this is a dress for a royal .
you &apos;ll love maman &apos;s dress . i @-@ i promise .
i can &apos;t wait to see you in it .
how about some cold prosecco to kill the pain ?
this just in .
due to a reader &apos;s dumpster dive
outside a well @-@ known fifth avenue prewar ,
it appears someone we know and love is in the family way .
so this is your humble gossip girl
issuing an a.p.p.b.
who could the mother of our next scandal be ?
what &apos;s wrong , dorota ?
nothing . uh , nothing at all .
prosecco ?
no , thank you .
i think i need all my wits for the next round .
oh , no , it &apos;s okay .
i gave up drinking at the beginning of summer .
you know , l.a. lifestyle .
come on . you guys need one .
cheers .
at least this secret is bound to show itself soon .
the first meeting was a disaster , s.
he conceded to sophie on everything .
oh , it was so out of control ,
you would &apos;ve thought he was italian .
well , finding a balance between your mother and your fiancee
has gotta be tough .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s just trying to keep the peace the best he can .
stop being so rational and trying to see both sides .
i haven &apos;t even told you the worst part yet .
they want me to wear sophie &apos;s dress .
not just on the day ,
but in &quot; vogue paris , &quot; too .
hand @-@ me @-@ downs are for charity and second children ,
not for the bride on her wedding day .
louis knows how upset i am .
he said he &apos;d talk to sophie , but ... i don &apos;t know .
b. , first of all , &quot; vogue paris &quot; --that &apos;s amazing !
and you &apos;re gonna look beautiful in whatever you wear ,
which should be sophie &apos;s gown .
that way , she has a gorgeous photo of you
looking exactly how she wants ,
and that way you have more leverage
to wear your own dress on the real day .
see , this is why i wish you were here .
aren &apos;t you done out there ?
los angeles is a plastic surgery layover ,
not somewhere you live .
serena , your guests just came through the gate .
okay , thank you . i &apos;ll be right there .
b. , i love you and i miss you , too .
all right . tomorrow , same time ?
today we did me , so we can do you ?
of course . you &apos;re on my schedule .
aw . listen to you , all professional .
bye .
miss blair , have you seen &quot; gossip girl &quot; lately ?
no .
we need to discuss something ...
something affecting both our futures .
the only thing affecting our futures
is your inability to clear a table fast enough .
it appears that louis has spoken to sophie .
i need to look my best for my first royal apology .
here you go .
thank you .
and do you mind telling jane that i need to talk to her ?
i know they &apos;re on lunch .
sure .
i don &apos;t remember approving a set visit for your friends .
you must be marshall .
and who are you ?
he &apos;s chuck bass .
hey , so the stuntman &apos;s prepped for the fall .
can you , uh , ask david to meet me by the bag
to talk to the double ?
what &apos;s the stunt ?
i could show you .
you know what i have to say .
then go .
i have to find david . i &apos;ll tell jane you stopped by .
get back to work .
well , the zip codes may be different ,
but douche bags are the same no matter where you go .
but now he &apos;s gone . go find jane .
okay , what are you gonna do ?
hey , s . is this my noon audition ?
yes .
wait .
are you kidding me ? you &apos;re kidding me .
you &apos;re gonna be great .
yeah , i &apos;ll totally hold .
thanks , epperly .
i don &apos;t get it . why would vanessa steal your story ?
oh , to teach me a lesson .
let &apos;s just , uh , hope i &apos;m wrong ,
which ...
i &apos;m not .
did gabriela ever call you back ?
you think maybe jenny &apos;s heard from vanessa ?
why would she call jenny ?
yeah , yeah , i &apos;m--i &apos;m here .
okay .
thank you .
epperly &apos;s friend at &quot; vanity fair &quot;
says all he knows is graydon carter read the story
and decided to run it .
oh , that &apos;s pretty cool , right ?
i mean , &quot; vanity fair &quot; &apos; s gonna publish your writing ?
if only they were doing it because of my writing .
i mean , they--they think it &apos;s about a celebrity .
really ? why ?
oh , because it &apos;s about a celebrity , kind of .
uh , blair waldorf , future princess of monaco .
i wrote it in the spring , after she and i ...
what ?
where you going ?
to find the one person
what can help me stop this before it &apos;s too late .
it &apos;s okay . i accept .
accept what ?
your apology .
you didn &apos;t talk to your mother .
it &apos;s just so hard to say no to her .
i worry she &apos;ll make things more difficult later
if she doesn &apos;t get her way right now .
i &apos;m trying to ease her into our future .
the future is here .
we &apos;re gonna be married in three months .
i need to know that we &apos;re in this together ,
and i &apos;m not just standing here alone .
you &apos;re not . i &apos;m right here .
those are just words .
i need proof .
you &apos;re right .
the dress discussion can wait until tomorrow .
but tonight , i show my mother that you come first .
be ready at 6 : 00 .
ready for what ?
you will be on my arm at the general assembly gala .
i thought there was a rule .
it &apos;s about to be broken .
what do you say ?
this isn &apos;t right . these two walls need to be white .
serena . are you looking for marshall ?
no . you , actually .
i hope it &apos;s to tell me
why you didn &apos;t follow up after our first meeting .
i didn &apos;t scare you away , did i ?
no . no , no , no . not at all .
i just didn &apos;t want to step on marshall &apos;s toes .
why not ? keeping on them is what david hired you to do .
if it weren &apos;t for you ,
he wouldn &apos;t have even read the book .
and it was his thoughtful comparison of the book to the script
that &apos;s helped keep all of the departments focused .
but i @-@ i did that the first week .
if i would &apos;ve known he was doing it , too , i ...
i &apos;m not trying to get anyone in trouble .
please don &apos;t ...
no one &apos;s in trouble .
a little reminder that things don &apos;t go unnoticed never hurts .
what would you say to a little more responsibility ,
see how you do with it ?
i &apos;d say ...
yes .
jane just called , gave me the rest of the day off .
said i was taking too long to finish her task list
and that i should leave the rest to you .
looks like things really do come easy to serena van der woodsen ,
just like i heard .
but if you think you can do my job better than i can ,
here &apos;s the test .
&quot; pull tomorrow &apos;s sides ,
&quot; update phone sheet , take dogs to groomer ,
write coverage of eugenides . &quot;
this isn &apos;t so bad . how long did she give you to do this ?
till tomorrow .
okay , well , i &apos;ll have it done by the party later .
well , i hope i don &apos;t see you there .
oh , you will . wait . have you seen my friends ?
hey , get down from there !
guys . guys . g--
you &apos;re about to be in a lot of trouble ,
but i get the feeling you don &apos;t care .
you free tonight ?
i am now .
oh ! i forgot to ask you . how was the audition ?
well , after i told them i wasn &apos;t an actor ,
they said , &quot; that &apos;s too bad , because you &apos;d be perfect
as a kid from an east coast political family
who &apos;s constantly manipulated
while trying to keep everyone around him happy . &quot;
they told me that .
you should &apos;ve said , &quot; yes ! &quot; i mean it .
if there was still in oprah , she would &apos;ve been all over that .
oh , i like gayle .
me , too .
so by the way , thank you for letting me use your card .
if you hadn &apos;t been here ,
i don &apos;t know how i would &apos;ve gotten this task done--
which i &apos;m sure was marshall &apos;s intention .
hey , gotta love california &apos;s laws .
oh , by the way .
does patrick roberts have glaucoma or something ?
like a--like a little nervous twitch ?
who knows ? it was the last thing on the list .
&quot; get patrick his medicinal weed . &quot;
i wonder which one he &apos;ll want--
blueberry headband ,
dragon of shaolin , or sushi friday ?
headband &apos;s pretty good ...
from what i &apos;ve heard from people telling me that it &apos;s good .
no , no judgment . i &apos;m just curious why you need it .
it &apos;s not like cruising around on a yacht is stressful .
uh , no , i know that , okay ? but doing nothing
has given me a lot of time to think , you know ?
and maybe the last couple years
are starting to take their toll on me ,
between my family , juliet ...
raina , you .
i mean , sometimes i wish i could just reinvent myself , you know ?
well , you &apos;ve come to the right place .
everyone in hollywood reinvents themselves .
i mean , look at me .
i have gone from &quot; it &quot; girl to working girl
in just 3,000 miles .
i &apos;m impressed . i &apos;m impressed .
look , if you &apos;re sick of being you ,
be someone else for a while .
yeah , and just where do you suppose that i do that ?
at the party we earned our way into tonight .
what do you say ?
my , don &apos;t you look lovely !
miss blair go to u.n.
with louis and the princess ?
i @-@ i @-@ i thought it wasn &apos;t proper .
it isn &apos;t . miss blair testing prince .
louis told me he would stand up to his mother tonight .
so if he does , everything can continue the way it &apos;s meant to .
and if he doesn &apos;t , he and his mother will have
a lovely wedding in november without a bride .
or she could just take my place ,
which seems to be what she wants .
wish me luck .
darling , is the stress of the wedding getting to you ?
testing a good man who loves you never ends well .
nothing is getting to me , mother .
i am a waldorf woman .
i need to know i still have a voice
and that voice is heard .
now i &apos;m gonna go wait for louis downstairs .
i swear ,
sometimes i don &apos;t know where she gets it from .
louis .
dan .
hey . uh , listen , i @-@ i really need your help .
i wrote a story
that this magazine is publishing in their next issue ,
and i really don &apos;t want them to .
i have no idea how to stop it ,
but i @-@ i figured , you know ,
if you put your royal weight behind it ,
it could be dead in an hour .
i &apos;m sorry . i have an event i &apos;m late for .
blair is--
blair is the one the story &apos;s about .
i swear to you , if this story ever sees the light of day ,
you are not gonna be happy .
you ready to go ?
i thought your text said you were bringing a friend .
oh , marilu got a ride with patrick roberts .
she goes wherever he goes anyway .
why ? are they together ?
no , she &apos;s his minder from the bond company .
he has to stay sober , or the film gets shut down .
luckily , you and i don &apos;t .
but you won &apos;t be needing that helmet . i brought my truck .
riding mulholland can be pretty dangerous ,
and that &apos;s where the party is .
well , i &apos;ll throw this inside .
stick and stones may just break bones ,
but the wounds from words never heal ...
especially when they &apos;re words we hoped we &apos;d never read .
on second thought ,
i &apos;m sure i could ride carefully .
nothing &apos;s that dangerous , right ?
here you go .
oh , you can &apos;t possibly--
have finished ? she did .
everything ?
well , technically , there &apos;s still one thing left .
have you see patrick ?
yeah , outside by the pool .
this is your chance .
what are you talking about ?
come on . you &apos;re at a party
all the way across the country from your real life ,
where no one knows your name .
who do you wanna be ?
no . no , i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s not how it works . all right ?
oh , my god . are you that guy-- that guy from that movie ?
uh ... yes .
i love that guy . can we have your autograph ?
yeah .
do you live in l.a. ?
yes .
is that your maybach in the driveway ?
yeah .
this is your house ?
yes .
how about a tour ?
yes . absolutely .
uh , this is a private tour .
my , my .
if it isn &apos;t new york &apos;s finest .
nice to see you out and about for once .
thanks , patrick . it &apos;s good to be out .
hey , i , um , have something for you .
what are you doing ?
production sent me for it .
well , that is awesome .
marilu said it was cool ?
well , i @-@ i guess .
have fun ?
i will now .
i can &apos;t even believe i &apos;m answering this call .
i &apos;m so sorry , blair . something &apos;s come up
that &apos;s taking me longer than anticipated .
now it looks like i won &apos;t make it to the gala at all .
you &apos;re going with &quot; vague &quot; on this one ?
&quot; something &apos;s come up &quot; ?
why don &apos;t you just admit that
you &apos;re already in the u.n. with your mother
instead of lying ?
i &apos;m not . i wish i could tell you where i am ,
but i made a promise .
and we know how you honor the promises you make ,
as long as they &apos;re not to me .
tell your mother congratulations . she won .
what are you talking about ?
call down to jimmy and tell him to get me a cab .
where are you going ?
do you collect ?
yes .
a helmut newton , right ?
yes .
is that lauren hutton ?
yes .
or is it lisa taylor ?
yes . how &apos;d you know ?
mm , i have a good eye ...
and good taste .
is this the master bedroom ?
let &apos;s destroy it .
how is the score going ?
uh , well , we &apos;ve almost finished the key theme .
and we &apos;ve been listening to that leonard cohen score
that he did for &quot; mccabe &amp; mrs. miller &quot; for inspiration .
i &apos;m sorry . would you two excuse me just for a minute ?
is everything okay ?
marshall just informed me
that he found patrick with some pot ,
which luckily he was able to confiscate
before disaster struck .
disaster ?
marilu &apos;s from the insurance company .
the movie only keeps its completion bond
if patrick stays sober .
if she found out he broke his sobriety ,
she &apos;d have to shut the movie down .
i can &apos;t imagine how he got his hands on it .
well , i &apos;m gonna go get patrick . he &apos;ll tell us .
he is scared out of mind at what he almost did .
excuse me .
oh , thank god . i was ...
blair ?
hey , what are you doing here ? did louis , uh ...
uh , i didn &apos;t know where else to go .
i wasn &apos;t gonna come here .
i hadn &apos;t talked to you all summer , and ...
you &apos;re the only person i know in new york right now ,
and i really need a friend ,
if you &apos;re still ...
of course i am . what &apos;s going on ?
i am about to call off my engagement .
i can &apos;t marry someone
who doesn &apos;t stand up for me , not even to his own mother .
and ... when i tell him it &apos;s over ,
i &apos;ll need to get away , to clear my head .
you were in the hamptons ?
uh , amagansett . cece &apos;s house .
is it empty ?
take me there .
okay .
uh , we can , uh , we can take my dad &apos;s car .
you &apos;ll call louis from there .
i &apos;ll be there with you ,
for whatever you need .
often , all it takes to find a new path
is to make a sharp turn and see what you find .
you gotta take it easy up here .
people write songs about wiping out on our l.a. roadways .
i &apos;m not scared .
well , you should be .
i &apos;m not scared of anything .
but beware .
sometimes what you &apos;re faced with is a dead end .
oh , my god . are you okay ?
i &apos;m perfect . you see any blood anywhere ?
i could use a glass of scotch , however .
should we walk or should i drive you on yours ?
okay , i know i don &apos;t know you at all ,
and you probably could give a damn about what i have to say .
most of the people in my business are in it
because they &apos;re thrill @-@ seekers or adrenaline junkies .
but for some of them ,
there &apos;s something darker going on .
i think you need help .
i said i &apos;m fine .
well , that may be , but ...
this date is over .
good luck , chuck .
thank you .
my best friend was right .
saying &quot; yes &quot; makes everything better .
well , based on my own recent experience , i &apos;ve have to agree .
now it &apos;s time for you to leave .
well , if that &apos;s how you want to be about it , okay .
but it is my house .
don &apos;t you think you should be the one to go ?
actually , this is my house .
and just so you know , this isn &apos;t the master bedroom .
it &apos;s a guest room-- the smallest one .
nice to meet you , by the way , um ...
nate .
mm . that &apos;s a great name .
uh , and you are ?
done now .
how could you do this to me ?
you think i didn &apos;t know what you were up to ?
try to tell me that doing everything on jane &apos;s list
wasn &apos;t just to show me up .
so you decided to add a few tasks that could get me fired ,
not to mention shut down the movie ?
i didn &apos;t think you could actually come through .
i thought you &apos;d have to tell jane you couldn &apos;t finish .
i need this job more than you do , okay ?
i pay for my life .
i have student loans , rent , a car lease .
i can &apos;t afford to get fired .
and i can ?
you &apos;re serena van der woodsen .
you do one lap around this party ,
you &apos;ll get ten job offers .
you weren &apos;t even looking when you found this one .
in two weeks , when you &apos;re at college ,
will you even look back at this as anything more
than that thing you did that summer ?
this is my career .
i haven &apos;t found him yet , but when i do ...
marilu , wait .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m the one that gave patrick the pot .
and he only took it because i told him production okayed it .
someone played a joke on me ,
and if i wasn &apos;t so intent on proving my worth ,
i @-@ i wouldn &apos;t have fallen for it , but ...
i did .
i &apos;m sorry .
you can tell jane i &apos;ll clear out my desk in the morning .
i don &apos;t understand , louis . are you following me now ?
no , blair .
actually ...
it &apos;s fine if you are ,
because i can do this in person then .
no , louis is not here ... for you .
he &apos;s not ?
what the hell is going on ?
louis didn &apos;t meet you tonight
because he was helping me .
helping you what ?
last spring , i @-@ i @-@ i wrote a story about you ,
and due to a series of unfortunate events ,
that story is going to be published .
was ... going to be .
was .
uh , i asked , and louis kindly obliged to ...
help me kill it before it came out
so it wouldn &apos;t embarrass you , and that &apos;s exactly what he did .
he really is your prince .
it may not have been standing up to his mother ,
but it was protecting you against the world .
you gotta understand ,
i didn &apos;t ever think anyone would read it .
you let me almost walk away from everything tonight .
and all the while , you knew exactly where louis was ,
exactly what he was doing for me .
how could you let that happen ?
why would you ?
what possible reason could you have ?
lonely boy learning three words , eight letters
don &apos;t come out right when no one wants to hear them .
come on , louis . let &apos;s go .
i &apos;m done here .
hey , are you happy ?
we decided what we wanted ,
went after it like you said , and look what happened .
yes , look . serena ,
you accepted responsibility without hesitation
for maybe the first time in your life .
and , nate , you had more fun not being you
than you &apos;ve ever had actually being you ,
which means you now know you need to change .
is it just me , or is what he &apos;s saying actually making sense ?
maybe we &apos;re not awake yet .
we &apos;re growing up .
we need to start being responsible for ourselves
instead of always being responsible for others .
what , you knew ?
nate , i know you think i must be dying inside
because blair is marrying another man .
but we let each other go .
so stop doing stuff like this and start focusing on yourself .
and you .
though this part of your journey may have come to an end ,
it shows you there &apos;s a world out there you never knew existed ,
one you want to be part of .
have you ever thought of writing a book ?
people like me don &apos;t write books . we &apos;re written about .
okay , i should go clean out my desk .
yep . i should probably get outta here , too .
i &apos;m pretty sure i left my phone at the party last night ,
and while i &apos;m at it ,
i should probably apologize to the hostess .
i &apos;ll stay here alone with my genius .
come here . ah .
too close . too close .
don &apos;t be shy . don &apos;t be shy . don &apos;t be shy .
what ?
no , is it my hair ?
i didn &apos;t want to say anything in front of louis ,
but i found something
hidden in the pantry .
is this why you have been acting so strange about louis ?
is there something you need to tell me ?
is me who needs to confess .
baby number two on way .
this is what you needed to tell me yesterday
that would affect our future ?
yes . i @-@ i just want to tell you first ,
but you were away ,
and it not right to text &quot; hello , pregnant ! &quot;
and--and then you were back , but you did not let me speak ,
and so now news comes out this way .
at least news out .
and &quot; gossip girl &quot; talk about me . i feel so special .
congratulations !
well , well , well , upper east siders .
i got my answer after all ,
and it turns out the only thing expanding
at the waldorf residence is the help .
yet all this talk about expecting
has got me thinking about expectations .
i had no idea i was gonna meet him out here ,
i didn &apos;t expect to make contact till new york .
but something tells me
i &apos;m gonna see him again even sooner than i imagined .
oh , much sooner .
call you later .
you must be here for this .
yes . thank you .
and listen , i know you don &apos;t know really know me at all ,
but i feel like i owe you an apology
for pretending to be someone else .
and i only did it because i &apos;m just now starting to realize
that , well , i don &apos;t really know who i am .
anyway , i &apos;m sorry ,
but i still had a lot of fun with you .
as did i. and i accept .
who knows ? maybe we &apos;ll see each other around sometime .
yeah .
good @-@ bye .
bye .
you wanted to see me ?
yes . there &apos;s a whole load of things
i need done on my list this morning .
oh , i @-@ i guess you didn &apos;t hear .
i heard . marilu told me .
&quot; the beautiful and the damne &quot; wraps in a week ,
but how would you like to keep working for me ?
you &apos;re the first one in every morning ,
the last one to leave every night .
i need someone with your dedication and fire .
although you might want to check with me
the next time one of my tasks seems a little off @-@ the @-@ wall .
yeah .
well , what do you say ?
i would love to .
hey . what &apos;s going on ?
lily has another meeting with the decorator .
she &apos;s redecorated so many times , it looks exactly the same .
i keep telling andy cohen he should make a show about her
called &quot; the real house arrests of new york . &quot;
well , you can , uh , hang here with me ,
help me with this mail .
good , because i have some time
before the 9 / 11 memorial 10th anniversary album launch .
oh , and by the way , your story was amazing .
thanks for letting me read it . i &apos;m just a little bit confused .
i @-@ i expected something negative about blair ,
but in fact , it was quite the opposite .
why was it so important that no one read it ?
did you make it to the end ?
well , i assumed that was artistic license .
did ... that actually happen ?
mm . a writer never tells .
so now i just have to make sure that
the book that chapter comes from never sees the light of day .
there &apos;s a whole book ?
well , don &apos;t get too excited . i &apos;m hoping , uh ,
vanessa only leaked the one chapter to the magazine ,
since that &apos;s all they had .
oh , look .
air mail from barcelona .
the thing about expectations
is most of the time , someone else sets them for you ,
yet you feel like they &apos;ve been there all along
and you can &apos;t wait to live up to them .
you ready to go ?
i &apos;m not coming . guess why .
jane offered me a job .
what did you say ?
i said yes !
really ? that &apos;s great .
oh , thank you .
i mean , it wouldn &apos;t have happened without you two .
how about now ?
your new l.a. lifestyle ready to make an exception ?
well , i think so . pop it open .
of course that happened .
there &apos;s--there &apos;s a bathroom in the dressing room right there .
i &apos;ll be right back .
just ... come on .
but just because you know what &apos;s expected of you
doesn &apos;t mean you still can &apos;t surprise everyone .
blair ...
you look beautiful .
of course she does .
mother , blair is not carrying those .
and there are some other things
i need to talk to you about , too .
do they know ?
know what ?
how far along you are .
i &apos;d say ... six weeks ?
they sent me your measurements .
well , you obviously can &apos;t read ,
or they were wrong when you got them ...
because i &apos;m not pregnant .
lie to me all you want ,
but your body will be telling the whole world the truth
by the time of your wedding .
nothing stays hidden for long .
the one month anniversary of our move .
it &apos;s crazy .
what &apos;s crazy is if your uncle hadn &apos;t left you
that tiny bit of money , we never would &apos;ve left miami .
i just hope you don &apos;t mind working a crap job with me
till we figure stuff out .
no , i &apos;m just glad to be away from there .
ivy , stop talking to your boyfriend and start working .
you &apos;re late .
don &apos;t get fired . we need the cash .
charlie !
and you often find what you least expect
is right in front of you ...
oh , my gosh !
serena ?
waiting to change everything forever .
what are you doing here ?
oh , what am i doing here ? what are you doing here ?
ivy . ivy , your shift .
that was weird .
um , let &apos;s get out of here .
yeah , let &apos;s go . okay .
whether you want to or not .
so good to see you .
it &apos;s good to see you .
