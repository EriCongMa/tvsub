surgeons have a saying --
&quot; all bleeding must stop . &quot;
‭ it &apos;s sort of our version of &quot; this , too , shall pass . &quot;
every crisis will eventually come to an end .
you &apos;ll either save your patient , or you won &apos;t .
are they gonna ask me about --
ben .
right . you can &apos;t tell me .
how &apos;s omar doing ?
i can &apos;t --
can &apos;t tell me that , either .
just doing my job .
thank you ... chief .
it &apos;s a good thing i &apos;m not trying to save lives
so i can see that the elevator doors are open .
so ...
... one way or the other , the bleeding will stop .
actually , as far as sayings go ,
this one &apos;s really not l that comforting .
omar singh , post @-@ op day one ,
following abdominal and chest surgery
to repair injuries sustained during a car accident .
deluca ?
shortly after surgery , omar went into cardiac arrest .
dr. shepherd placed him on therapeutic hypothermia
as part of a new resuscitation protocol .
tell me why .
we hoped that cooling the patient ...
he &apos;s regaining consciousness .
and he &apos;s breathing spontaneously , so they &apos;ll extubate soon .
thank god .
uh , grey , you should go . they &apos;re waiting for you .
okay .
oh , i put together an advisory panel --
grey , hunt , pierce .
they &apos;re going to review the warren situation .
bailey , we talked about this .
as the leader of this surgical staff ,
you need to take charge of it .
as the leader of this surgical staff ,
i need to know my limitations .
and i know i cannot be impartial about my husband
and the future of his career .
as a leader , i am taking charge of my lack of impartiality
by convening an advisory panel to review the matter .
once they give me their recommendation for how to proceed ,
as a leader ,
i will make a final decision on
what happens with my husband .
as a human being , i &apos;ll stand here and thank the lord
that my husband isn &apos;t responsible
for leaving three children without any parents at all .
warren , have a seat .
when miranda told me that there was an advisory committee ,
i pictured a bunch of lawyers and hospital suits .
okay . i &apos;m , uh -- i &apos;m glad it &apos;s you guys .
let &apos;s do it .
‭ dr. warren , be apprised that the purpose of this committee
is to understand the incident
and to make recommendations for disciplinary action ,
should it be called for .
a lack of full cooperation with
or withholding of information from this committee
will result in your immediate dismissal
from the residency program .
okay .
you accept these conditions ?
yes .
okay . let &apos;s begin then .
wait . so , she &apos;s still accusing me of harassment ?
i mean , i tried to meet her halfway here .
i tried to take the high road . this --
apparently , the high road is paved with restraining orders .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll be quiet .
the restraining order actually works for us .
when we take her to court to have it lifted ,
she won &apos;t be able to prove any of these allegations ,
and her character will be called into question ,
which is exactly where we want to be .
because ?
because once that baby is born ,
you will have a very good shot at obtaining full custody .
full custody ?
no . he would never .
he would .
look , i know that i &apos;m just here for support ,
but why would jackson do that ?
because it &apos;s exactly what i would advise her to do .
whether you meant it or not , april ,
this restraining order started an arms race .
the restraining order was a mistake .
can &apos;t we just take it back ?
i &apos;m serious here . do not try to talk to him .
the restraining order needs to stand .
we have to do this together , okay ?
this is exactly what i was trying to avoid .
after everything that happened with samuel , i just --
i just want to keep this baby safe .
good . see ? you -- you felt your baby was in danger .
that &apos;s great . that we can use .
fractured pelvis ?
stepped on by a horse .
so , tomorrow &apos;s the day .
preminger grant -- yes or no , stay or go .
oh , you haven &apos;t given them an answer yet ?
you thought i would have given them an answer
and not talked to you about it ?
no .
no . i &apos;m just saying ,
the preminger grant &apos;s a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime opportunity .
if i say yes ,
i will be moving to new york for at least a year .
right .
and you &apos;re fine with that ?
are you fine with that ?
well , like you said , it &apos;s ...
once in a lifetime .
yep . well , i got to get this pelvis into the o.r.
reggie dalton ?
i &apos;m dr. jo wilson .
your chart says that you have a hernia .
yeah . it &apos;s the worst .
okay , well , let &apos;s take a look . just lay back .
i &apos;m gonna lift up your shirt .
okay , so , how long has this been going on for ?
uh , i had surgery like , uh , six months ago ,
and after a while , this little guy
just started popping out of there .
six months ago ?
yeah . i had it looked at once before ,
and they said they could operate ,
but that it wasn &apos;t urgent ,
so i put it off and -- oh , god .
oh , no . oh , no .
reggie , are you okay ?
yes .
uh , this is the thing --
it &apos;s allergy season , and every time i sneeze --
the little guy pops out .
yeah . i think maybe i waited a little too long to get surgery
because --
oh ! oh , no !
okay , reggie , don &apos;t fight it .
it &apos;s only gonna make it worse .
worse than this ?
is my baby gonna die ?
no .
it &apos;s open before you even touch her .
i know that &apos;s what it looks like .
that &apos;s what it is , warren , right there .
you said you didn &apos;t see the doors open .
yes . i mean , no .
well , which is it -- did you , or didn &apos;t you ?
i didn &apos;t see them open .
it is right there in front of you .
i know , but i didn &apos;t see it .
it didn &apos;t register .
okay . help me here .
was it --
had you already decided to cut ?
no .
or did you decide getting in the elevator
and up to the o.r. was just gonna take too long ?
no .
ben , lying right now is going to make this end very quickly .
化验结果
i didn &apos;t see them open .
i spoke with your grandma ,
and she &apos;ll be here in a couple of hours .
your dad still has a long recovery ahead of him ,
but the fact that he &apos;s waking up is a really good sign .
you said i could see him when he wakes up .
i did .
and you will .
when ?
how about now ?
yeah ? come on .
now , before we go in ,
your dad &apos;s connected to some tubes ,
but that &apos;s normal ...
coming through !
... so don &apos;t be scared when you --
wait , jasmine !
daddy ? - deluca , get the suction --
okay , got it .
daddy ?
push more lorazepam .
what &apos;s wrong with him ? !
we &apos;re gonna need to put him back on the ventilator .
prep for rsi .
jasmine , they need to help him .
you said he was awake .
you said he was okay !
i know . i know , honey .
come on .
they were done with me for the day .
okay .
they needed to talk to the other doctors involved .
i see .
i wanted to check on my post @-@ ops ,
but they told me i couldn &apos;t go back to work
until all this was -- - yeah , it &apos;s best that you
not have contact with any patients .
okay , then , um ...
well , i @-@ i guess i &apos;ll just pick up tuck early from school .
you know , he &apos;s been begging me to go to this new arcade .
did he clean his room ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
well , he can &apos;t go to the arcade unless he &apos;s cleaned his room .
you know that , ben .
i &apos;m a grown @-@ ass man ,
and i was there when we made the rule .
i don &apos;t need you to tell me --
well , apparently you do because you &apos;re --
okay , stop . stop . just stop .
miranda ...
look at me .
miranda , i -- - you were mean .
this morning , you were mean .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
but th @-@ this is just -- this is running me over like a truck .
i feel -- - i know .
me too .
okay , so , we -- we need to separate this out , um ...
the chief and dr. warren over here
and ben and miranda over here .
church and state , okay ?
church and state .
dr. bailey , omar singh &apos;s mother is here .
tell her i &apos;ll be right there .
ben -- - i &apos;ll see you at home .
is home church or state ?
church , i think .
post @-@ surgical hernias are not actually all that uncommon ,
but given its size , we &apos;re gonna need to do a special procedure
to close the gap without tension on the --
what are you -- what are you doing ?
uh , i &apos;ve gotten in the habit
of just sort of shoving it all back in there .
is that not okay ?
um , wilson , we will be right back .
come on .
what are you doing ?
wilson called for a plastics consult for your csr ,
which i obviously can &apos;t do with you standing here ,
unless you want to violate the terms
of your own restraining order .
i &apos;m not -- i &apos;m not violating anything
because you &apos;re gonna go , okay ?
just send someone else , please .
why don &apos;t we ask the patient ?
he &apos;d want a consult from
the best plastic surgeon in this hospital .
you know that this is just as much
a general @-@ surgery case as it is a plastics .
right , and there are plenty of general surgeons
and only one of me .
i was here first .
holy crap !
you ignored the moment completely .
what moment ?
the moment where i say , &quot; go to new york , &quot;
and then you ask me to come to new york with you --
the moment .
what ? wait .
you didn &apos;t even want me to meet your kid .
no -- you met my kid .
my kid loves you . it &apos;s fine .
callie , you live here in seattle .
you -- you have family .
you have a job .
you can &apos;t just drop everything and move to new york .
i know , but still .
still what ?
i @-@ it would have been nice to have been asked .
what ?
you are the ...
most adorable woman i &apos;ve ever seen right now .
really ?
and of course i want you to come to new york with me ,
but it &apos;s impossible .
there is always ... long distance .
well , that &apos;s true .
weekend trips .
dirty phone calls .
exactly how dirty ?
oh , my god .
oh , god !
um , uh , i need a suture kit .
no . you know , i actually -- i don &apos;t need it . bye .
guys , we can &apos;t go back in time here .
i mean , there &apos;s no way to know how it would have turned out .
i mean , i sure wouldn &apos;t have opened her up in a hallway
if i didn &apos;t have to ,
but warren &apos;s saying that he didn &apos;t have a choice .
except for those doors -- i mean ...
yeah . the doors were open .
how do you not see those doors ?
and as for the baby ?
he was acidotic , not oxygenating .
we had to put him on ecmo .
which was unsuccessful .
that kind of perfusion can be too much for smaller babies .
riggs suggested ecmo . we all agreed .
wait . so , riggs suggested it ?
yeah .
and you agreed with that ?
well , i was worried , but we were out of options .
so , the ecmo that riggs suggested --
it exacerbated the problem ?
like i said , we were out of options .
okay .
well , i think that &apos;s all we need from you guys . thank you .
yeah . sure thing .
thanks .
good luck .
listen , we should meet again tomorrow .
with whom ?
we &apos;ve heard from everyone .
we haven &apos;t met with riggs .
oh , my god .
what ?
nothing .
what do you think will happen to warren ?
i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re already leaving .
if he goes , too , they &apos;re gonna work us to death .
we &apos;re gonna get all the surgeries .
i mean , i feel bad ,
but we gonna run this place .
holy --
what is going on with your phone ? what are -- - hey , stop !
stop !
no , no , no ! what ?
please give it back .
who &apos;s kyle ?
and why does he want to do things with his tongue --
answer the question .
okay , come here .
please . shut up .
okay , do you know shepherd &apos;s m.s. patient ?
&quot; guitar hero &quot; ?
you are doing tongue things with guitar hero ?
no . not yet .
i told him maybe we would go out when he got back from touring ,
and so we &apos;ve been texting ,
and now he &apos;s melting my phone .
that &apos;s kind of hot and really dirty .
yeah . i call my mother with this thing .
oh , god . like this .
how am i supposed to respond to this ?
oh , like this .
oh , my god !
thank you .
do you think you can teach me that ?
yeah .
your suture kit . i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s fine .
um , i should have knocked , i guess .
she &apos;s leaving . huh ?
new york .
the preminger grant .
i &apos;m so sorry . but , uh , you know , i don &apos;t know .
i mean , that doesn &apos;t mean that it has to be over .
long @-@ distance relationships aren &apos;t impossible .
yeah , i don &apos;t know if we can survive long distance .
i &apos;m so afraid that it &apos;ll all fall apart .
then don &apos;t let it .
i mean , decide you want it to work and make it happen .
it &apos;s new york .
it &apos;s a six @-@ hour flight .
it &apos;s weekends and phone calls .
you can figure it out . you will . you -- you should .
thanks .
hey , callie .
yeah ?
maybe next time , like , an on @-@ call room , something with ,
like , a lock on the door .
you stole my patient ?
he &apos;s my patient , all right ?
and you should probably step back about --
i don &apos;t know -- 100 feet .
all right , now .
this man needs a plastic surgeon .
and a general surgeon .
which is why dr. webber
is going to be scrubbing in with me , all right ?
i &apos;m the head of plastics . i have seniority here .
so i &apos;m not gonna step down
just because you decided to file a restraining order .
this -- th @-@ this is not --
okay , you know -- okay .
now , that &apos;s enough .
now , this patient isn &apos;t gonna get less than our best
because the two of you are not allowed to be in the same room .
i &apos;m scrubbing in with avery .
end of discussion .
i &apos;m free tomorrow after 4 : 00 .
so , he may never wake up again ?
he did wake up ,
but then he suffered a prolonged seizure .
he may have been oxygen @-@ deprived .
we &apos;re still trying to figure out why .
but you should know ,
reviewing his most current scans ,
there &apos;s not much activity .
they suggest he may have suffered severe damage .
so , even if he did wake up now ,
we &apos;re not sure what &apos;s left .
your son didn &apos;t have a directive .
these forms will determine
whether you want us to try and resuscitate omar
if his heart fails .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
it &apos;s a very difficult decision .
no , he &apos;s my baby .
i can still remember how it felt to hold him .
i can &apos;t just ...
i don &apos;t know what to do .
what do i do ?
you should sign the papers .
daddy wouldn &apos;t want to live in a bed
connected to machines
with his eyes closed all the time .
he would hate it .
and he would ...
he would want to be with mommy .
i need a pen .
we love you , daddy .
any change ?
no .
how &apos;d the warren thing go ?
it &apos;s still going .
it shouldn &apos;t be .
this is just owen being pissed at riggs .
i mean , i get that there &apos;s bad blood there , but --
well , it &apos;s really bad blood .
owen only ever told me headlines ,
and i had to drag it out of him .
it was impossible to get him to talk .
it &apos;s probably because you were talking .
uncool .
be nice .
yeah , and you know riggs cheated on owen &apos;s sister .
what ?
what ?
that &apos;s why she got on the helicopter and disappeared --
because she was leaving him .
still , it &apos;s old business .
and he lied about it right to my face .
he made up some sad story about
how he tried to stop her from getting on the helicopter ,
but she had to save a patient and he had no choice .
he made himself look pretty good .
wow . that &apos;s ...
psychotic . i agree .
so , owen does not trust him , and i &apos;m not inclined to , either .
heart rate &apos;s dropping .
i &apos;ll get a crash cart .
no , no , wait . he &apos;s dnr .
i hate this part .
mer ?
bailey will want to know .
you didn &apos;t wake me .
where are my keys ?
why didn &apos;t you wake me ?
have you seen my keys ?
they -- i got called in .
yeah , which is why i want to know why you didn &apos;t wake me .
i had them in my hand when i walked in the door .
i wake you . you wake me . that &apos;s -- that &apos;s the rule .
y @-@ you get paged in the middle of the night ,
you wake the other person .
you wake me so i @-@ i know to listen for tuck ...
... so i know not to rush out of here for the hospital
in the morning thinking you did the morning thing
and you just had an early surgery ...
... so i don &apos;t leave our child in the house asleep in his bed
when i should be waking him , making him breakfast ...
.... and taking him to school
because that &apos;s my job ,
because that &apos;s the rule , because that &apos;s what happens ...
... because wh @-@ when you get paged , you wake me .
w @-@ would you stop looking for the damn keys
and tell me why you didn &apos;t wake me , miranda ?
omar is dying ,
and while you stand there and yell at me ,
three children are becoming orphans .
i did not wake you
because i didn &apos;t want to talk to you right now .
keys .
that was ...
seriously , you have skills .
i don &apos;t work alone .
teamwork .
i don &apos;t , though , work alone .
i &apos;m gonna be miserable without you .
you never asked me to stay .
i can &apos;t .
penny ...
penny , i want you to stay .
i would -- i would give anything for you to stay .
but i @-@ i know better than to ask .
i have been here before .
this is the beginning of a whole new adventure for you .
i could never ask you to give that up .
i love you too much .
you --
i love you .
no , no , don &apos;t cry .
i love you .
and you love me .
and now i have to go all the way across the country
to save lives ...
... which sounds really noble , like in some movie but ...
... actually it just really sucks .
penny ...
it &apos;s the moment again .
the moment .
ask me .
go ahead .
ask me .
sofia , get those teeth brushed , missy !
i want to hit the road in about 10 minutes !
hi .
something is wrong with the baby ...
really , horribly wrong .
wrong ? wrong how ?
i was driving to the hospital ,
and , um , i got so scared that i couldn &apos;t breathe ,
and your place is c @-@ closer , so i just ...
what -- hold on , april . slow down .
just -- tell me what &apos;s going on .
jackson was right , wasn &apos;t he ,
that i was wrong to not ch @-@ check ?
okay , hey -- - i can &apos;t !
arizona , i cannot do this again .
i can &apos;t .
ooh , you are being such a good little helper .
let &apos;s walk a little faster , okay ?
oh , andrew . um , andrew &apos;s gonna show you
where all the best coloring books are , okay ?
i am ?
yeah .
okay .
come on .
i refused the ultrasound .
i needed this baby to be healthy so badly ,
and now , if i caused this ...
okay , okay . it &apos;s okay .
if we could have prevented this ...
all right , let &apos;s just take a look .
let &apos;s take a look , okay ?
okay , okay , okay .
there . there &apos;s the little one .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s it . th @-@ th @-@ that &apos;s the feeling .
what is that ? what is that ?
that &apos;s your baby moving .
look .
very strong fetal heartbeat .
that &apos;s the baby moving ?
samuel never ...
i know . you &apos;ve never felt this before .
i &apos;m gonna check the cervical length
just because of the cramping ,
but i am confident that this is just
what a healthy baby feels like .
advisory panel ?
the situation seemed fairly clear .
well , that doesn &apos;t make deciding disciplinary action any easier .
i suppose .
what if it were you and me ?
would it be so easy for you to make that decision ?
you and i would never be in this situation .
well , you never know .
yes , i do &apos; cause if you did something like this ,
i &apos;d just strangle you with my bare hands .
i wouldn &apos;t be the one to do this .
i &apos;m talking about you .
oh , please , please .
this is all of it , i think .
all of what ?
well , i got joint purchases ,
marriage license , post @-@ nup , divorce decree .
our attorneys asked jackson to put together whatever he could
to help create a timeline , a paper trail .
do we have to do this now ?
uh , yeah , i got to get it back to him by the end of the week .
well , i &apos;ll leave you to it , then .
oh , and thanks again , sir , for , uh -- for yesterday .
appreciate you backing me up .
i didn &apos;t back you up .
i backed up a patient whose doctors couldn &apos;t
get it together long enough to do their damn job .
the baby was in respiratory failure
despite maximal ventilatory support .
he fit the criteria , so ecmo was the only option .
i agree .
all right ?
what was his oxygenation index ?
around 45 for at least 20 minutes .
okay .
and you used aggressive resuscitation ?
yeah , of course .
they tried to clear his metabolic acidosis with fluids ,
but he had a ph of -- i mean , i can pull the chart .
we have the chart .
so , what is this about ?
this is about dr. warren .
thank you , dr. riggs . you can go .
sure .
this was fun .
so , if riggs &apos; recommendation killed the baby ,
then we should -- - i would have made the same call .
there was nothing else left to do .
we don &apos;t know that .
okay , we need to - bring this back to the point
because you have frankly been wasting my time
on a needless witch hunt .
this is not about dr. riggs , and it is not about you .
the point here - is to answer one question --
do we think ben warren is telling us the truth ?
so let &apos;s answer it .
his blood pressure keeps dropping ,
and his heart rate is all over the place .
well , it &apos;s been hours .
and he hasn &apos;t had any further seizure activity .
we could give him medication to control his heart
and fluid to boost his pressure .
no .
mrs. singh ?
he &apos;s gone .
my son is gone .
i @-@ is omar ...
is he gone ?
you -- you can tell me that .
we &apos;re still waiting .
church ?
state .
so , did you find something new or --
warren , we need you to tell us why .
why what ?
why , when the elevator doors opened ,
you chose to ignore it ...
i have told you and told you ...
and cut open gretchen mckay anyway .
that i did not make a choice .
i wasn &apos;t given one .
i @-@ i was forced to use the knowledge and resources i had
to fulfill the oath i took to save her life --
because the door didn &apos;t open .
no , it did . it clearly did .
i &apos;m saying i didn &apos;t see it happen .
i just don &apos;t understand how you didn &apos;t see it happen .
you do . you know . y @-@ you should know .
y @-@ you &apos;re surgeons .
you know what it &apos;s like .
you -- when you operate ,
when you control if a person breathes another breath ,
when -- when you hold their beating heart in your hand ,
when you are responsible for that life ,
you don &apos;t see or hear
or feel anything else .
the rest of the world just disappears .
you know that .
you all do .
you can &apos;t tell me you don &apos;t .
what &apos;s happening ?
he &apos;s having runs of v @-@ tach . i think he &apos;s going .
his mom just took the kids down for lunch , too . i ...
should i bring her back up here ?
chief ?
crash cart .
what ?
yeah . i need a crash cart in here now !
start cpr .
oh , dr. bailey , i don &apos;t think we &apos;re supposed to .
push an amp of epi .
what is this ? - uh , dr. shepherd , i -- i --
bailey , what are we doing ?
okay .
good . charge to 100 .
mnh @-@ mnh . uh , isn &apos;t he supposed to be dnr ?
yes . his mother agreed .
clear ! -
okay , charge to 150 .
get that epi on board .
bailey , we told his mother we would not resuscitate .
clear !
200 !
bailey !
his heart stopped ?
yes , it did , but only just for a second , and then --
you decided to resuscitate .
but i signed those papers .
jasmine and i -- we made a decision .
yes , i know .
i wanted to give him one more chance .
so you think there &apos;s still hope ?
i don &apos;t understand .
just yesterday , we were discussing brain damage .
chief , a word .
bailey , just explain what you are thinking .
my patient has a signed dnr .
the patient deserves a chance .
his family deserves
for this hospital to respect their wishes .
shepherd --
it is not fair
to make a patient suffer so that warren doesn &apos;t have to .
you know that .
dr. shepherd , watch yourself .
you were right , and thank you .
i love being right . what was i right about ?
penny . we figured it out .
yeah , no , sofia was saying -- - i can totally go with her .
what ?
no . it seemed impossible
until i really , really looked at it , but it &apos;s not impossible .
it &apos;s an adventure .
you &apos;re kidding .
are you kidding ?
i know . it &apos;s crazy , right ?
but i can get a job anywhere out there ,
and probably with new research money ,
and i have colleagues out there
who can help me get a place -- - um , wait . yeah , no , but you -- you --
well , you have a daughter .
yeah . no . i know .
it &apos;s a lot to figure out , i know ,
but you were right -- it can be figured out .
it &apos;s a six @-@ hour flight ,
and you &apos;ll be able to see sofia whenever you want .
and we &apos;ll figure it out , right ?
oh , crap . um , so , we will talk about it , okay ?
but just thank you .
every surgeon who worked on mrs. mckay and the baby
said the same thing , including dr. warren .
that they were backed into a corner
and they didn &apos;t have a choice .
the only difference with warren
is whether or not you think he &apos;s lying ,
whether you believe he didn &apos;t see that door open .
and do you think he was lying ?
no .
we don &apos;t .
we believe warren missed the door .
we believe he was completely focused
on his responsibility to the patient .
well , thank you all .
sounds like they feel he tried .
and yet two people are still dead .
what are you gonna do ?
s @-@ six months ?
no surgery for six months ?
uh , to be clear , it &apos;s a six @-@ month suspension
from the residency program .
i &apos;m suspended from the hospital ? !
yes .
how do you --
d @-@ do you have any idea how far behind i &apos;ll fall ?
i &apos;ll never get caught up .
what am i supposed to learn from this ?
do you feel even the slightest remorse ?
yes . yes !
h @-@ how can you ask me that ? of course i do !
all i do is play it over again in my mind ,
trying to figure out how i could change it .
of course i do .
but six months -- - it &apos;s -- it &apos;s not discipline .
for a surgeon , that &apos;s a death sentence .
i might as well drop out now .
that &apos;s all , dr. warren .
i tried to save her the only way i know how .
you -- they know that , right ?
you know that .
sofia !
you ready ?
you ready ?
let &apos;s go .
oh , thank you !
get inside !
pierce , before you go ,
tacoma wants to send a patient with failed stenting --
emergency four @-@ vessel bypass .
i didn &apos;t want to authorize it
until i &apos;d checked it with you , but ...
uh , well , is the patient stable enough to transfer ?
as far i &apos;m concerned , yes .
okay , yeah .
go ahead .
what ?
nothing . nothing .
what did owen tell you about me ?
meredith -- she said , um ,
she &apos;s my sister , and she told me ...
she told you about megan .
why would you lie about something like that ?
you know , i shouldn &apos;t have asked .
this isn &apos;t any of my business .
and i @-@ i &apos;m not usually a person who , uh --
you don &apos;t owe me an explanation , obviously ,
but you &apos;re a good guy
and a great surgeon , and i just ...
why ?
i didn &apos;t lie to meredith .
it &apos;s fine . forget it .
look , everything i told her was true .
there was a patient .
there was a helicopter .
i just left some parts out ...
the part where we fought ...
where i cheated ...
where i failed - the best person i &apos;ve ever met ,
the only woman i &apos;ve ever loved .
and those parts are for me and megan .
you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t owe anyone that .
i made a mistake ...
a big one .
and i &apos;ve paid for it ever since .
okay ?
okay .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re being strong about this .
i know how hard this is .
i know how bad you feel .
you loved this person once .
there &apos;s a child involved .
but i &apos;m gonna tell you --
the one thing that all custody cases have in common
is that they are always a battle .
and no matter what , even if you win ,
you will still feel like you lost something .
so , are you sure this is a battle you want to fight ?
my ex @-@ wife wants to move across the country
and take our daughter , so ... yeah .
stop .
no . no more , okay ?
i &apos;m done . just stay away from me .
all right , look ,
i &apos;m not gonna come any closer , okay ?
i just need to talk to you . i need to say something .
i need you to hear me .
please ?
fine .
all right , i have been going over the paperwork ,
you know , for the lawyer --
the prenup , post @-@ nup , whatever .
you know , i just -- i don &apos;t need this .
at first glance , it was actually really frustrating ,
you know , &apos; cause i wasn &apos;t finding anything
that was actually gonna help my case .
it was just so fair .
um , and i realized that was because it was written
by two people who really loved each other ...
two people who really wanted to protect each other ,
who really wanted what was best for each other .
and , april , i , uh --
i don &apos;t know where those people went .
i don &apos;t know if we can fix us , april .
i don &apos;t know if we should .
but i know i don &apos;t like who i am turning into .
i don &apos;t want to treat you ...
this person who wrote this , who signed this ...
was your best friend .
you were my best friend , april ...
my favorite person .
and i realized that that &apos;s who i should be dealing with .
we should treat each other the way we did on this paper .
you want to feel something unbelievably awesome ?
was that a kick ?
he &apos;s kicking ?
or she &apos;s kicking .
this baby can kick ?
our baby can kick .
oh , he did it again .
why are you still here ?
you have to go back to them . you have to --
hunt and this committee .
you have to get them to reconsider .
there &apos;s n-- they have nothing to reconsider .
they made a recommendation . i made a call .
it &apos;s very simple , and i &apos;m done talking about this here --
church and state .
there &apos;s a reason that it &apos;s separated .
oh , to hell with state !
you &apos;re really gonna come back at me with --
with &quot; no special treatment &quot; ? six months is --
six months is special treatment !
what ?
if you had been anyone else ,
you wouldn &apos;t have been suspended .
you would have been fired .
they told you to fire me ?
no . i wanted to fire you .
i was talked down .
do you have an idea what you are doing ?
do you have any idea what you &apos;ve done ?
i made a mistake , miranda . people make mistakes .
surgeons make mistakes .
i don &apos;t , not like that .
you made an astonishing error in judgment ...
... that i &apos;m trying to accept and forgive .
and it &apos;s gonna take me a lot longer than six months .
all bleeding must stop .
well , i am sorry i disappoint you .
sometimes it does so at a cost .
so am i.
you lose the arm , remove the organ .
you choose to live with the loss ...
chief ?
... because - at the end of the day ,
you &apos;ll do whatever you can to stay alive .
in the last hour , he started moving ,
responding to verbal stimuli .
and now vitals are stable .
he is re @-@ oriented .
what -- - this is one in a million .
it shouldn &apos;t have happened .
and sometimes , by some miracle , it works .
the bleeding stops .
well , does he know yet , about his wife and baby ?
no . not yet .
he &apos;s asking .
i was wrong , bailey .
you saved his life .
and now i have to go in there and ruin it .
but sometimes , no matter how hard you try ...
... it &apos;s still not enough .
