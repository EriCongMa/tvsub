what would you do to help elizabeth keen ?
anything .
find karakurt .
the cabal hired him to do what she &apos;s being framed for .
figure out a way to infiltrate the crime ring
that may be protecting karakurt .
we will come for you , huh ?
i &apos;m counting on it .
marvin gerard -- acts as shadow counsel
to some of the biggest players in the criminal underworld .
yeah , we could make it work .
we only have one shot at this .
i &apos;ll be in touch .
i &apos;m here because people in our organization
have lost confidence in you .
the fbi and the cia must communicate ,
which means you two must work together .
i &apos;m fine with that .
the brain is everything .
memory , consciousness ...
personality .
imagine if we could free the brain from the body .
what then ?
without that wretched carcass marching you toward death ,
you might live forever .
you &apos;d like to live forever , wouldn &apos;t you , dr. kucera ?
i know i would .
despite the pain and isolation of being trapped in that skin ,
your paper on twin prime conjecture
set the world of number theory on fire .
hats off to you , sir .
hats off .
i &apos;m in awe of your intellect
and the seminal contributions you &apos;ve made
to the field of mathematics .
well , that &apos;s why -- that &apos;s why i &apos;ve chosen you to --
to join us on this wonderful voyage .
soon , you &apos;ll be free of that broken shell .
you &apos;ll be able to walk and talk with ease .
you may even be able to sing and dance .
does that appeal to you , dr. kucera ?
i should think it would .
you and i , along with the others ,
will free ourselves .
we shall slip the surly bonds of earth
and touch the face of god .
i see the captain &apos;s turned on the seat belt sign .
make sure that your seat back and folding tray
are in their full upright position .
we &apos;re in for a bumpy ride .

okay .
drink . it &apos;s japanese macha tea .
it has 17 times the antioxidants of wild blueberries
and seven more than dark chocolate .
you will be fine , elizabeth . he will make sure of it .
i thought i was taking care of you .
how &apos;s the patient ?
stubborn .
sweet .
stubborn .
lizzy , what do you know about andras halmi ?
the french economist ?
belgian .
he &apos;s an econometrician .
he develops economic models
using regression analysis and game theory .
one of the world &apos;s greatest minds .
and he &apos;s been abducted .
what does that mean to us ?
andras halmi is the director &apos;s most trusted adviser
and has information that is critical to our plan .
at first , i thought it might be a random abduction ,
but that appears not to be the case
because another elite econometrician
went missing in paris 10 days ago .
&quot; another &quot; ? how many are there ?
it &apos;s a small group -- too small to be a coincidence .
in the last six months ,
two acclaimed geneticists have gone missing ,
two prize @-@ winning civil engineers --
always a man and a woman .
someone is building an ark , lizzy ,
and populating it with some of the most brilliant minds of our time .
but to clear your name ,
we need to find andras halmi .
and to find andras halmi , we have to find that ark .
we know about the abductions .
the bureau believes it &apos;s some kind of a brain drain .
whoever &apos;s responsible is organized and resourceful .
likely a foreign power .
why force your country to learn
when you can just grab the world &apos;s experts
and advance decades overnight ?
it &apos;s a novel theory , donald ,
but , like all novels , it &apos;s fiction .
we &apos;re not dealing with a rogue nation @-@ state here .
we &apos;re dealing with the next name on the blacklist .
we &apos;re not .
not unless you give me a good reason why .
the director .
you &apos;ve been ordered to work together ,
to share intelligence in the pursuit of agent keen .
i imagine that &apos;s a rather awkward
and fraught relationship ,
one you &apos;d be anxious to terminate .
i &apos;m listening .
andras halmi , a confidant of the director &apos;s ,
is among the missing .
he has valuable information i need .
you want us to find him .
yes . without alerting the director , of course .
yeah , well , good luck with that .
his team &apos;s tapping into our system .
be that as it may ,
he must not find out about this case .
so , getting settled in okay ?
you can dispense with the pleasantries .
we &apos;re not your houseguests .
my team has been reviewing the activities
of this task force for the past few weeks ,
and it appears that you have not only been communicating with reddington and keen .
but have been assisting them in some investigative capacity .
that &apos;s right .
that was him on the phone , giving us another case .
so you admit , then , to servicing reddington &apos;s agenda
instead of hunting him down ?
we talk to them because it keeps them close ,
increases our chances of making an arrest .
you do more than talk .
the djinn , the verdiant indictments --
every case that reddington has given us
has taken down someone important to the cabal .
that okay with you ?
i don &apos;t have time for conspiracy theories , agent ressler ,
and neither do you .
this next case -- full debriefing in 30 minutes .
you &apos;re telling me you had no other choice but to kill this man ?
i did what i had to do in order to get to karakurt .
they &apos;ll be looking for you .
yeah , i hope so .
that was your plan ?
to kill a known associate of charlie volkens .
you know , i don &apos;t exactly remember you offering up a better plan .
do you have any idea who you &apos;re dealing with ?
let me remind you .
charlie volkens isn &apos;t just karakurt &apos;s brother @-@ in @-@ law .
he &apos;s a drug dealer , an extortionist ,
runs an underground fight club .
he &apos;s a sociopath surrounded by people who fear him .
the bureau can pin three murders on volkens
but can &apos;t get a conviction
because nobody in the community is willing to talk .
which is why you couldn &apos;t get him .
in fact , you couldn &apos;t even find him ,
and now he is coming to find me .
he &apos;s coming to kill you .
and once he has you , once you &apos;re in his world ,
that &apos;s exactly what he &apos;s gonna do .
i don &apos;t care . he &apos;s hiding karakurt .
i won &apos;t be able to help .
i &apos;m gonna find him .
i &apos;m gonna drag karakurt back here if i have to .
they &apos;ll also come for asher sutton .
you gonna let him die , too ?
if that &apos;s what it takes to exonerate liz .
biophysicist goes missing in berlin .
another is taken in rome .
a neurologist vanishes in johannesburg ,
while another goes missing in san francisco .
always a man ...
... and a woman .
reddington identified six victims -- three pairs .
using his theory ,
we &apos;ve been able to create 16 matches worldwide --
32 victims .
anthropology , computer science .
this may sound random , but it &apos;s not .
this is a list of the key graduate @-@ degree programs at harvard .
he &apos;s collecting leaders in each field of study .
once he chooses a discipline ,
he completes the pair before moving on .
two days after an anthropologist was taken in nepal ,
another one was taken in ankara .
hang on . i think i may have a lead on his next victim .
this is dr. richard kucera ,
chair of mathematics at a university in barcelona .
dr. kucera disappeared two days ago .
you expect his next victim to be a woman in the same discipline ?
exactly . thing is , there &apos;s only one female chair of mathematics
who &apos;s at the same level as dr. kucera ,
and she is here in america .
her name is anna neehoff .
currently on sabbatical , living in arlington --
6234 norwood drive .
contact local p.d. send all units .
samar and i are headed there now .
this is it ? this is all you have ?
what &apos;s reddington &apos;s agenda ?
welcome to our world .
there is something you &apos;re not telling me .
who he &apos;s after , for instance .
i &apos;d like a name .
he didn &apos;t give me a name .
look , if you got a problem ,
why don &apos;t you take it up with reven wright ?
we got a job to do .
got her .
first floor , second window from the right .
same play as the others ?
yep . grab her , bag her , take her to the cloud .
i wanted you to see this , dr. kucera .
this is the procedure we &apos;ll be doing with you .
freeing that beautiful mind .
yeah .
we &apos;ve located dr. neehoff .
good news .
we &apos;ve found you a mate .
like you , she &apos;s a mathematician .
and i think ...
in the utopia i &apos;m preparing for all of us ,
you &apos;ll see why i chose her for you .
bradley .
can you access the fbi files
relating to these abductions ?
everything in the system .
do it .
i have a feeling there &apos;s something they &apos;re not telling us .
yes , sir .
无来电号码
no answer on her cellphone .
where &apos;s your head at ?
with the director in the war room ,
if we find liz , he finds liz .
and if he finds liz ...
he &apos;ll kill her .
we have protocols in place that &apos;ll guarantee keen &apos;s safety .
you think he &apos;ll follow the rules ?
laurel hitchin put him in here .
if he goes off book ,
it blows back in her face and the president &apos;s .
no way she &apos;s gonna let that happen .
you have one new voicemail message .
dr. neehoff , my name is samar navabi .
i &apos;m with the fbi .
we believe you may be in danger .
we &apos;re on our way to you right now .
please lock all of your doors and do not let anyone in .
back door and garage are clear .
tommy . radio nolan and tell him to watch the front .
shut up !
anna ?
anna ?
units in pursuit of a blue econoline
with three suspects heading west on lexington .
down !
stay back !
stay back !
get out of the vehicle . put your weapon down .
ressler , he took off toward the house .
you move , your next thought &apos;s gonna be about a bullet .
the men are working as fast as they can .
you built that awful grotto for that wedding
in tuscany in six days ,
complete with stalactites .
well , that was different .
yes , but infinitely more complicated ,
and you ripped it out in a day and a half .
yeah , and i didn &apos;t have an inspector up my ass eight hours a day .
cedric , lives are at stake ,
the fate of nations .
bribe someone , push someone around .
i don &apos;t care . just get it done .
where &apos;s this inspector ? i want to talk with this guy .
dembe , the pelican case .
marvin .
tell me you &apos;ve found andras halmi .
there &apos;s been a small wrinkle .
halmi is all that matters .
the director is working with the task force .
need i remind you that without halmi ,
a crucial element of our plan vanishes
faster than a fart in a fan factory ?
you wanted to see me ?
you must be --
busy keeping track of all your code violations .
portofino is lovely this time of year .
life &apos;s too short to spend haggling
over flex conduits and electrical chases .
my son drowned in portofino .
well , who could &apos;ve predicted that ?
forget the inspector .
what about halmi ?
leave halmi to me .
you find out whatever you can about that inspector .
hey , gwen .
asher around ?
we told you not to come back here , okay ?
where is he ?
asher !
what are you doing here ?
pack your bags . do you have a safe ? open it .
we called the police . we want nothing to do with you .
get your passports and whatever cash you have in the house .
do it right now . - the police --
the police aren &apos;t gonna be here in time , gwen .
the others .
they &apos;re coming .
for you . okay ?
we didn &apos;t kill anyone . we did what they asked .
do you have a safe ?
we &apos;ll tell them what happened .
we &apos;ll just -- we &apos;ll tell them the truth .
the truth is , they sent someone to get a debt , and he &apos;s dead .
somebody has to pay .
so , t @-@ they &apos;re gonna kill us ? is that what you &apos;re saying ?
i &apos;m trying to help you , all right ?
if you just do exactly what i say -- - you did this to us !
you came into our lives . y @-@ you targeted us .
yeah .
why ?
listen to me right now .
these men -- they are going to be armed ,
they are going to be very , very dangerous ,
and they are going to try to hurt you .
who are you ?
listen to me -- find a place to hide
and do not come out , no matter what you hear .
do you understand ?
i want my lawyer .
he &apos;s more afraid of whoever he &apos;s working for than he &apos;ll ever be of us .
he &apos;s not talk .
he &apos;ll talk to me .
the inspector -- what &apos;d you find ?
there &apos;s not much .
ex loves him , taxes paid , church on sunday .
but he does have one weakness --
lisa thomopoulos .
aspirations of becoming a pastry chef .
flunked out of cordon bleu .
seems she can &apos;t tell a baklava
from a balaclava .
i forgot the egg wash .
okay . i @-@ i @-@ i just -- i just need to clear my head .
i @-@ i &apos;ll have a cigarette . 10 minutes .
can i just take 10 minutes ?
you must be lisa .
max said your eyes were radiant ,
but my god .
mesmerizing .
it &apos;s a very small space . we want to brighten .
i love mauve , but a soft , creamy yellow
will just open up the entire room .
we also need to land on cabinet options and millwork today .
i &apos;m already arguing with my supplier .
tell me if i &apos;m going too fast .
i &apos;m sorry .
i have no idea what any of this means .
oh , my goodness .
max didn &apos;t tell you .
tell me what ?
about your restaurant .
i ... don &apos;t have a restaurant .
i ... think we need to take a drive .
your birth name is michael karpos .
i understand you &apos;ve been employed
by some of our subcontractors .
well , on behalf of our nation , thank you for your service .
i also see that you have an ex @-@ wife
and a daughter who attends st. bartholomew &apos;s academy
in scotch plains , new jersey .
pretty .
are you acquainted with the bible , mr. karpos ?
i am .
at one point , i actually considered the priesthood .
can you imagine ?
there &apos;s a passage -- exodus 20 : 5 @-@ 6 .
&quot; for i , the lord thy god , am a jealous god ,
visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children . &quot;
we wouldn &apos;t want that .
would we , mr. karpos ?
the man you &apos;re looking for is sir crispin crandall .
the reclusive billionaire ?
he &apos;s behind the abductions ?
he takes them to a complex
near the boston @-@ manchester regional airport ,
and what he does there , god only knows .
come now , richard .
eat . drink .
it &apos;s not as if you have to worry about putting on weight .
soon , we &apos;ll be relieving you of that crippled body ...
to prepare you for a brave new world .
sir ?
it &apos;s about miss neehoff .
it appears we have a situation .
dear , dear , dear .
keep eating , richard .
i shall return .
matias , i don &apos;t appreciate being summoned .
talk to me about andras halmi .
you thought the task force was holding something back .
they were . who is he ?
how do you know what i was or was not thinking ?
i know everything , peter .
almost always before you .
your analyst discovered that they deleted halmi &apos;s name
so you wouldn &apos;t find it .
why ?
andras halmi is a trusted adviser .
then why haven &apos;t i heard of him ?
he &apos;s critical to this organization ,
and he must be found .
i think you &apos;re lying .
fine , then . don &apos;t help .
but if you don &apos;t
and our friends in bonn learn of your insubordination ,
i don &apos;t think they &apos;re gonna be very pleased .
okay . tell me what you know .
plumbing leak , missing handrails .
handrails ? handrails ? !
exposed wiring , unlicensed subcontractor .
you &apos;re shut down .
okay , fine . you shut us down .
i will sue you for losses ,
you beer @-@ swilling frostback !
lisa ?
i know , i know . i ruined the whole damn thing .
but there were too many decisions to make without her .
after all , it is her restaurant .
i can &apos;t believe this .
max has been working night and day
to get this place fixed up .
all those classes , the hours you spent
perfecting your tarts , your ... crumpets .
if he told me once ,
he told me a thousand times
you should be feeding all of montreal
in your own restaurant .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
neither do i.
we could do puff pastries . oh , and a little sunday brunch .
and those little tea cakes that you love !
i need one day working &apos; round the clock with no interruptions .
after that , the place is yours .
who are you ?
the man who &apos;s gonna help you make her dreams come true .
clever .
but none of it &apos;s gonna matter
unless we get andras halmi .

crispin crandall .
wait . you don &apos;t have authority to go --
that &apos;s a no @-@ knock warrant .
get on the phone . call your boss .
tell him the fbi needs to talk with crispin crandall .
what the hell is this place ?
we &apos;re not gonna wait to find out .
i want to talk to charlie volkens .
you got any idea where you are , sport ?
you know what we do here ?
asher sutton .
he has nothing to do with this .
oh , yeah , he does .
tonight he does .
you two got ringside seats .
he &apos;s innocent .
you don &apos;t have to hurt him .
oh , i ain &apos;t got to hurt anybody .
that , i leave to you .
you boys are top of the card tonight .
no queensbury rules .
unlimited rounds .
winner takes ... everything .
crandall cryonics is a legitimate firm
that specializes in cryogenic preservation .
it &apos;s more hope than science ,
but true believers think it &apos;s possible
to freeze the human body , suspend death and disease
so that patients might be reanimated and cured
when new technology is developed in the future .
according to the company &apos;s records ,
none of the missing scientists are here .
the dewars contain patients with legally binding contracts .
well , if they &apos;re not here , then where are they ?
if the employees know , they &apos;re not saying ,
and we can &apos;t question crandall .
why ? because he &apos;s a billionaire ?
because he lives on a plane , which he refuels in the air .
wait -- what ? he doesn &apos;t land ?
according to the faa ,
he &apos;s landed 30 times in the past three years .
each time coincided with the date of an abduction .
he was scheduled to land today
but scrubbed it less than an hour
after we prevented anna neehoff from being taken .
he was coming for her -- like the others .
this plane is an ark .
or a jail .
it can &apos;t be easy keeping 36 people against their will .
it is if they &apos;re frozen .
um , no . it &apos;s an a 380 .
definitely big enough to contain a mobile lab
and store multiple corpses .
doctor .
it appears we have an issue with our fuel tanker .
a small change in schedule .
but fear not .
once everything is under control ,
we &apos;ll move ahead with your procedure posthaste .
don &apos;t go anywhere .
we think we know
what happened to the people who were abducted .
you found halmi ?
the victims were cryogenically frozen
by some nutjob billionaire named crispin crandall .
frozen ?
yeah .
where is he keeping them ?
in his jet --
some flying icebox that never touches down .
he has a refueling tanker .
not anymore . we grounded it .
excellent . that &apos;s all i need .
ring edward . tell him we need the jet .
we &apos;re gonna pay a little visit to sir crispin crandall .
crispin crandall ? i thought he was dead .
no , he &apos;s very much alive , and it seems he &apos;s responsible
for our international brain drain .
he has halmi .
but he also has a big problem i may be able to alleviate ...
the fbi .
you gave them this case .
and now i &apos;m taking it away .
crandall is flying into a trap .
he needs somewhere to land his spruce goose .
okay , people .
we have 67 minutes before that plane drops out of the sky .
i need a location -- now .
sir ? take a look at this .
we found him .
nsa satellite picked up an a380 descending
on course for a regional airstrip outside halifax .
the plane &apos;s waiting .
i &apos;ll notify rcmp on the way .
target is headed for pittsburgh .
and the fbi ?
headed for halifax , based on false satellite intel ,
when , in fact , crandall &apos;s jet should be touching down
at a former military runway near pittsburgh
in about 30 minutes .
connellsville . i know it .
i &apos;m guessing that reddington redirected crandall there ,
since he wants halmi ...
probably cut a deal with him to get him ,
which means that reddington will be there ,
as will keen .
this is fun .
terminate them both .
secure halmi &apos;s body .
his body ?
if halmi &apos;s dead , why does reddington still want him ?
just take care of reddington and keen ,
and we will be done ...
with loose ends .
gentlemen !
gentlemen .
our final bout today
is a no @-@ holds @-@ barred grudge match
between two rank amateurs .
there will be no rules .
sucker @-@ punching , kicking , biting , and gouging
is not only allowed ...
but encouraged .
the winner will be ...
the last man ...
breathing .
fight !
come on , man . put your hands up .
come on , man .
youon &apos;tight , they &apos;re gonna kill us both .
i didn &apos;t come here to fight !
i came here for the russian .
he doesn &apos;t want to fight .
what should we do about that , gentlemen ?
don &apos;t make me do this .
i &apos;m sorry .
the plane &apos;s not going to halifax ?
apparently not .
but we &apos;re going to halifax .
nsa intel indicated that &apos;s where the plane was heading .
uh ... it &apos;s not . it &apos;s landing near pittsburgh .
the opposite direction . how is this possible ?
the director set us up .
aram , are you sure about this ?
i set up an air @-@ traffic @-@ control alert
for crandall &apos;s transponder ,
figuring when he moved through controlled airspace ,
he &apos;d have to turn it back on .
the alert says pittsburgh .
where the director will have a team waiting for them .
and reddington . when i talked to him --
i think he knows where the plane is headed .
if he does , he and liz are walking into a trap .
i &apos;ll tell the pilot to change our heading to pittsburgh .
refueling is done .
we can be airborne as soon as you complete
your business with mr. reddington .
he &apos;s here ?
ah , there he is .
sir crispin .
i &apos;m raymond reddington .
what are you doing here ?
i wired payment for the fuel .
and i voided it .
truth be told , i &apos;ve decided on a different form of payment --
andras halmi .
i &apos;m not giving you halmi .
of course you are .
at least , the part of him i &apos;m interested in .
but first , please indulge my curiosity .
an ice castle in the air ,
the best and the brightest frozen solid .
i &apos;m intrigued .
you know what these are ?
they &apos;re horseshoe crabs .
decades ago , it was discovered
that their plasma contained limulus amebocyte lysate ,
which can be used to detect bacterial endotoxins .
i found a way to synthesize it .
that &apos;s how you made your fortune .
but more important ,
they were the inspiration for my vision .
they have survived four mass extinctions .
we are now on the cusp of the final mass extinction ,
caused by a species
of clever but greedy primates known as homo sapien .
everyone dies , mr. crandall .
death is a process .
no one is really dead until the information
contained in the brain is lost .
cryonic preservation prevents that loss .
are you a gambling man , crispin ?
no .
i abhor casinos .
oh , yes . well , i would agree with you there .
but perhaps you &apos;re familiar with the old saw
&quot; you can &apos;t beat the house &quot; ?
no matter how many poor souls you turn into popsicles ,
the fix is in .
the world in which you awaken will be one
incapable of sustaining human life .
and why ?
because at the critical tipping point ,
one tragically quixotic megalomaniac
cannibalized humanity of the very minds
that might have been its salvation .
you see , if you were a betting man ,
you would understand that now trumps later every time .
the future is a sucker &apos;s bet --
a maybe , a contingency ,
a &quot; what if ? &quot;
the only thing that is real is the present ,
and you &apos;ve plundered it --
robbed it of the very geniuses
that might have averted the dystopia you so fear .
indeed , perhaps even the very one
who might have devised a means
to revive your sad , tired , frozen ass .
congratulations , crispin .
you &apos;ve doubled down on extinction .
life on earth is going to end . soon .
cryonics is our only hope .
it won &apos;t work .
i &apos;m betting it will .
so you are a gambling man .
let &apos;s place that bet , shall we ?
what was that ? i thought i heard --
what happened ? is he dead ?
dead ? pish posh .
what &apos;s death ? it &apos;s just a process , right ?
notify the lab . tell them to gather the team
and prepare for a full @-@ body cut @-@ down .

the director gave his attack dogs the real address
so they could get halmi
and kill reddington and keen .
do you still think our protocols will keep them safe ?
they survived .
this time -- but as long as he &apos;s here ,
as long as we &apos;re sharing information --
i said he wouldn &apos;t go off book . i was wrong .
but thanks to these feeds that we got off of crandall &apos;s jet ,
i can prove it now , and when i do ,
laurel hitchin will have no choice but to boot him out .
today was a win , navabi .
how do you figure ?
reddington said halmi had information he needed .
my guess is he used his thumbs to get it --
to get past some kind of a biometric lock or a safe .
what kind of information ?
i don &apos;t know .
but the director didn &apos;t want him to get it , and he did .
son of a bitch can &apos;t be happy about that .
hello , peter .
i hope i &apos;m not interrupting cocktails with lynda .
congratulations on getting to halmi before i did .
yes , it certainly is celebratory drinks here ,
so i &apos;ll be brief .
i think it &apos;s about time to exonerate elizabeth keen .
that is not going to happen .
oh , but it is .
the only question is whether you &apos;ll live to see the day .
if i continue to dismantle the cabal ,
they &apos;ll put a bullet in your head
just to mitigate their losses .
everything is working according to plan , peter .
you overestimate your influence , raymond .
your plan is of no concern to us .
peter .
you &apos;ve been skimming from the company till ,
stealing millions in anticipation of running away .
when you were linked to the cabal ,
you reached out to halmi --
put your golden parachute
in a secret account only he could access .
except now i &apos;ve got it .
you have no money to escape the inevitable .
your colleagues will abandon you .
maybe not today or tomorrow , but soon enough ,
because i &apos;m not going to stop until they do .
unless i exonerate keen .
it &apos;s one small chance to save your life .
such a generous offer .
i &apos;ll have to decline .
i &apos;m going to bring this whole damn thing down on you , peter .
and when i do ,
you own people will beg me to kill you to stop the bleeding .
takes a hard heart to kill a man with a knife .
so ... you wanted to see me ?
not you .
him .
who the hell are you ?
i &apos;m the guy who &apos;s taking you back to d.c.
to admit that you framed my wife for murder .
here &apos;s how it &apos;s gonna play out .
i &apos;ll take tiny tim out first because he &apos;s the biggest threat .
then russian guyavitch goes for his gun , right ?
but i &apos;m betting that he shoots one of you instead of me .
and volkens is already pissing his pants ,
so i don &apos;t think he &apos;s gonna be a problem .
and that would leave ...
me and you .
karakurt .
don &apos;t kill me .
not yet .
