Ian Doyle vanished from prison.
Interpol can't find him.
Am I in danger?
We all are.
Prentiss, get down!
We're looking for a European team
With considerable training. For one of them, it's personal.
Hey, what's that?
Bank accounts traceable to our first two victims.
We might be able to match the rest of those faces.
Hello, Lauren. Oh, wait.
Lauren reynolds died in a car accident, didn't she?
Come near my team and I will end you.
You took the only thing that mattered to me.
So I'm gonna take the only thing that matters to you--
Your life.
All the federal and international agents
responsible for tracking him down
are now on his list of targets.
Lauren Reynolds.
This is the guy I told you about.
He told me everything but a name.
Ian Doyle. Pleasure.
I love being the man bringing people together.
Have fun, kids.
Jack told me you were provisional I.R.A.
Used to be.
Then the peace accord happened.
Now I gotta look for work like everybody else.
Except...Ian--
That's a protestant name, isn't it?
Not a lot of protestants in the I.R.A.
Or is that how you proved you were a good fighter,
defending your mother for giving you that name?
And what is it you do, Lauren?
Right now I'm trying to get into business
with a former I.R.A. captain.
He's gone freelance. You might have heard of him.
Valhalla.
Yeah.
I might know him.
Well...
since this is sensitive...
I said out!
Get out of here, Fahey.
Do you know who I am?
I am the man. I used to run this block.
Now you're just a bum. Out!
I got 4 names on the bottom of the list Prentiss gave us.
Luke Renault,
Lawrence Riley, Lila Rafferty,
Lyle Rogers.
All with the initials L.R.
The CIA uses cryptograms like that
to assign to non-official cover agents
working the same case.
So do other foreign countries.
These last 4 names are covers--spies.
Wait.
No. This isn't right.
Do you see this space? That shouldn't be here.
Could it be a formatting error?
No, this is a spreadsheet template.
Formatting doesn't allow for this.
There's a missing name on here.
It's another spy whose cover is L.R.
Lauren Reynolds is dead.
Lauren Reynolds is dead.
Lauren Reynolds is dead.
What?
"Lauren reynolds is dead."
Prentiss said that on a phone call 17 days ago.
But her intonation wasn't surprise or grief.
It was like a mantra, like she was reminding herself.
Lauren Reynolds, L.R.
If Prentiss is the last name on that list,
she's on Doyle's list, too.
That explains her behavior the past month.
The secrets, the evasion.
She's been biting her fingernails again, too.
Guys.
She left her badge and gun? Why would she do that?
That doesn't make sense. Why run?
We're her family. We can help.
Doyle's killing families.
She's not married, not close to relatives.
He was ready to wipe us out.
She ran to protect us.
Battery's dead, Fahey.
Jeez. Lauren.
She's a trained spy. She doesn't want to be found.
She knows all of our tricks.
We don't know any of hers.
All right, then how do we find her?
Here's how. Ian doyle is our unsub,
Prentiss is our victim.
We profile their behavior and we treat it like any other case.
Because terrorism isn't an area we specialize in,
I've reached out to an expert from the state department,
Someone who can also shed light on Prentiss' past.
Who?
Her.
Let's get to work.
How many men does Doyle have, Jack?
Doyle? I haven't seen that guy in a--
15, maybe 20 guys.
Any surprises?
Just automatic weapons. It's mostly local mob guys.
There's a little bit of I.R.A. And--
Lauren, how about you do me a favor,
huh, you ease up on that gun, ok?
I helped you and Clyde back in the day.
I can help you now.
Do you want to know where Doyle is?
I already do.
Yeah, but what are you gonna do, huh,
take him out on your own?
What are you gonna do, tell him?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

Author Elizabeth Bear.
Ok, so I talked to a friend from Langley.
He couldn't give me Emily's full CIA history,
but he could give me this.
She assumed the identity of Lauren Reynolds
as part of a special task force called JTF-12.
I heard about them.
They were profiling terrorists, weren't they?
Yeah, assembled after 9-11.
CIA and western agencies
contributed their best and brightest.
But serial killers and terrorists
have different personality traits.
How does Doyle fit in?
He was their last case.
And now the JTF is on his hit list.
Jeremy Wwolff was victim number one,
from Germany's BND.
Sean McAlister at Interpol
was the second. He's the one
that brought the jtf in to work the Doyle case.
He was murdered last week in Brussels
with his wife and daughter.
Tsia Mosely of France's DCRI.
She got engaged to Jeremy earlier this year.
After he died, she fled to D.C.
And team leader Clyde Easter,
british S.I.S.
He hasn't checked in since Tsia's murder.
He was also in D.C.
Did JTF make the arrests?
No, the host countries handled that.
The team moved on to the next case.
If all they did was deliver a profile,
how does Doyle even know about them?
Well, considering the shadowy nature of terrorist cells,
they utilize a skill we don't--infiltration.
Who was undercover on Doyle?
Emily. She made contact with him in Boston
to get intel on Valhalla.
She was posing as another weapons dealer.
Look at how she's dressed.
She seems awfully comfortable.
How close did she get to Doyle as part of her cover?
The recon they did on Doyle included
a background of all of his romantic relationships.
Emily was his type.
She asked you to stop here yesterday?
Yeah.
Change her boots and...
get whatever she needed, I guess.
It's never easy, you know,
having to dig through a friend's life.
But that's not what's bugging you, is it?
You're angry
because she crossed the line with Doyle.
No, I'm not.
I'm angry because a group of mercenaries
just shot at me.
I don't much like being shot at, Rossi.
Prentiss knew exactly what was going on,
but she didn't bother to tell any of us.
She couldn't without putting us at risk.
Come on, man, we don't know that.
All we do know is that she slept with a terrorist
for a profile.
And instead of coming clean with us about her dirty laundry,
She just ran with it.
You think it's that simple?
Till there's a reason not to.
Here's one.
That's her passport, the real one.
Now, if you wanted to vanish,
wouldn't you take that with you?
This doesn't mean anything.
I worked with that woman for 5 years.
I put my life in her hands.
I called her my friend.
But right now I can't even say that I ever really knew her.
Can you?
There's something down there.
What do you got?
It's called a gimmel ring.
The husband and wife-to-be wear individual bands
during the engagement and at the wedding.
You see the markings in the middle? Gaelic.
Doyle gave it to her.
This ring is more than just a souvenir.
Otherwise, why hang on to it all this time?
Why hide it from us?
What makes you think she went to Boston?
Well, the Doyle case started in Boston.
Maybe she's going back to old locations trying to hunt him down.
If he had us in his crosshairs, she wouldn't run.
She'd take the fight to him.
Pack up this stuff. I want to be out of here in 48 hours.
Open it.
Liam, something bothering you?
None of our other suppliers can get stuff this good.
She's too good to be true, and you're too blind to see it.
Shut it.
Get in the car,
the second one.
I'll take care of her.
Right.
You always ride in the second car. Why?
Because the first car
takes the hit in an ambush.
Are you going to... take care of me?
Yes, I am.
Good.
I need to ask you something.
You never ask me about my, you know, about my business,
about Valhalla.
Why is that?
I just...
assume you'll tell me when you're ready to tell me.
There is something I want to tell you.
OK.
I was gonna get you the ring, but, uh,
you said you're not the marrying type.
It's...
it's beautiful.
Look at me.
I am Valhalla.
I have no idea what kind of life we're gonna have, but...
I just want you in mine.
Sir, TSA got a hit on one of Clyde Easter's covers.
He's on a plane to Boston as we speak.
Have him detained as soon as he steps off. We need to go.
Garcia, you're coming with us.
Ok, yes.
Your government's gonna hear about this.
Will you call the British consulate, please?
British consulate, now!
Step back, sir.
You're being detained as a suspect in a murder investigation.
Wonderful.
Hey, it's me.
Hotch asked me to try all your numbers,
and I have this as an old listing,
and you probably don't even use it anymore.
But if it is you and you're out there,
come home, please.
God, Emily, what did you think,
that we would just let you walk out of our lives?
I am so furious at you right now!
Then I think about how scared you must be,
how you're in some dark place all alone.
But you're not alone, ok? You are not alone.
We are in that dark place with you.
We are waving flashlights and calling your name.
So if you can see us, come home.
If you can't, then...
then you stay alive.
'cause we're coming.
I only want Doyle. Where's Doyle?
Right here, love.
Right here.
There it is.
Hello, love.
Emily walked into a trap.
It looks like Doyle got into the suv.
But from this angle, you can see that he didn't,
which I wish Boston P.D.
would have told me before I started watching it.
Sorry again for the screaming.
She threw a flash-bang grenade into a car.
She's lucky the 3 people inside didn't die.
Is anybody else bothered by that?
Well, 3 bad guys.
Illegal as it is, I think Prentiss knows
she has to be as ruthless as Doyle.
He's come to the U.S. to wage a public vendetta
and hired a group of mercenaries to remain loyal to him.
He has nothing to lose, so she has to act the same way.
So how did Doyle know she was waiting for him?
Well, the mole must have told him, right?
The same guy who's been feeding Doyle the contractors and agents?
And our best suspect was
just arrested with a suitcase full of cash.
How do we get Easter to talk?
He won't cooperate willingly.
I'll handle that.
The rest of you focus on Doyle's location.
I hate to be the one to ask this,
But how long does Emily have?
Her best chance is also the most troubling.
Doyle saved her for last
because he views her as his stressor.
Which means he'll take his time.
Where's my ring?
I flushed it.
I spent 7 years in hell
because of that ring.
So now I'm going to give you another gift,
One you won't get rid of so easily.
A four-leaf clover
should be a nice addition
to your other tattoos.
You still have two, right?
Yep.
And that's enough ink, thanks.
Ink?
North koreans can't afford ink.
No, no. They brand themselves.
The more you fight, the more this will hurt.
Get your hands off me! Do you know who I am?
I'm the man!
Who's that?
Jack Fahey, irish mob.
He called Easter's cell phone 12 times in 6 hours.
Any connection to Doyle?
Boston P.D. Says he's low level.
But the irish mob
has long-standing ties to the I.R.A.
See if you can get anything out of him.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you keeping me alive?
Hey. FBI grabbed Fahey.
Her people.
It won't be long before he starts squealing
And they're banging on our door.
Do what you have to,
so we get the hell out of here.
I know what you want.
Do you, really?
You want Lauren Reynolds back.
I can do that. I can be her.
You think that'll save your skin?
I have no illusions.
But I'm tired of this.
Of being afraid.
We don't have time for this.
We'll make time.
What about Fahey?
I'll take care of Fahey.
He smokes, right?
Aye.
Looks like you earned yourself a reprieve.
October 2006.
"In closing, I have never
worked with a finer agent than Emily Prentiss.
Her skill at analyzing and predicting
terrorist behavior is unparalleled."
Signed, name redacted.
You used all the right buzzwords,
told us everything we wanted to hear.
You sold her to us the same way you sold Doyle
to the north koreans.
Just because you know how I profile
doesn't mean you know me.
It takes a skilled sociopath to betray his team
and the cause he held dear for self-preservation.
If you cooperate with us and we save agent Prentiss,
Then maybe we could talk about a deal.
But if anything happens to her,
I will destroy you.
You can count on that.
She said you were the best.
I'm unimpressed.
We'll get Doyle with or without you.
Pack lightly. Guantanamo gets humid.
Nice try.
Oh, but--but I'm curious...
If I'm a sociopath,
I should feel no empathy, correct?
You're not the sociopath.
Doyle is.
I thought you were a better profiler.
Why were you calling Clyde Easter so much, Jack?
Anybody got a smoke?
How about you, beanpole?
What do you think?
Narcissism masking deep-seated insecurity.
So if we puncture his self-image,
This hood rat will talk.
Hey, hey, hey, I ain't no hood rat.
You take that back.
Well, you look like one. You smell like one.
You smell that?
Hood rat.
I am not!
Take it back!
Hey, Jack.
Do you know what a hood rat is?
You see what I mean?
He's just gonna have to learn the hard way.
All right, all right, look,
Clyde was gonna pay my medical bills,
All right? This ear, it ain't growing back.
What happened to it?
This bitch teammate of his shot it. Said it was a warning.
Thought she could take on
this I.R.A. big shot named Doyle.
So I told these--aah!
What the hell, man?! Jeez!
Where's Prentiss?
Who? I don't know!
Lauren Reynolds. Where is Lauren Reynolds?
Friend of yours, is she?
You tell us where she is right now,
or I swear, I'll send you to a prison
where they'll teach you
what a hood rat is.
And by the time you do,
She'll be in pieces.
So, uh...
my price just went up.
200,000?
What other leverage do we have?
Is he an addict?
He's having a nicotine fit.
We wouldn't let him smoke.
We could use that.
He'd relax, open his big mouth.
Is that enough?
Well, I'm pretty good with narcissists.
Dated a few.
And what is it you do...
Lauren?
I'm looking to get into business
with a former I.R.A. Captain
who's gone freelance.
Valhalla.
But since this is sensitive...
Let me out of these.
That's not how it went.
I can't make you happy in handcuffs.
You really think I'd let you fool me twice?
I just wanted...
I know what you wanted--
a way into my head.
But I changed the locks.
So you're going to suffer the way I suffered.
This won't be the first time you've killed an innocent,
But it will be the first time you have to watch.
Liam!
You know when a cigarette is best?
After sex with me.
Mind your manners.
All right. Whoa, whoa.
You're already extorting us for Prentiss' location.
So, just out of curiosity,
What's it like working for Doyle?
Eh, he's not so tough.
You got him?
Acquiring.
Which one's the target?
No!
This was about you and me!
That's what you said! You and me!
Then why is your team here?
'cause I didn't leave a trail.
Ian...
Whatever you want to do to me, I accept,
but leave them out of it.
Yes, except I didn't bring them into it, did I?
What are you thinking?
Woman first, then the goateed fella.
And then Fahey if he has a shot. If not, he'll shut up.
Yeah. Sounds about right.
Shoot Fahey.
If he dies, my team doesn't have anything.
Hello, Lauren.
Good to see you again.
Wow. I bet you're his hookup, aren't you?
I mean, after all, you're the man.
I could show you how much of a man I really am.
All right, all right, all right, jeez.
What's with the sexy cop/ bad cop routine?
What do you two think--
Down!
That's not going to come out.
Yeah, I know.
Ashley, we have a problem.
Without fahey, there's not much left.
We all want to save Prentiss so bad
that we can't see this case straight.
Ok. What do we do?
We depend on the team member with the freshest eyes.
Oh, no. Not me, no.
You haven't worked with prentiss
For 5 years. You're unprejudiced.
Now, what's been bugging you since we left Quantico?
How about the affair?
That bugs me.
How does the two of them
sleeping together change Doyle's profile?
I don't know.
Come on, Ashley.
It's textbook.
I haven't read every textbook.
You want me to hold your hand? Fine. What doesn't fit?
Just say it!
What are you thinking? Spit it out!
Why families?
Keep going.
Prentiss is Doyle's stressor.
He wants revenge on the woman who betrayed him,
and I understand that.
But why kill that child in D.C.?
That's the Agent Seaver I'm looking for.
Come on.
Let's get you a new shirt.
So, assuming Clyde isn't the mole,
we looked through the JTF's presonal records again,
and Jeremy made some fancy plans before his death.
Specifically, he bought a large estate in spain...
He signed all the documents with one of his covers.
Made a down payment in cash, deposited the rest.
So Jeremy sold the list to Doyle.
He was the first victim, killed quietly.
Doyle didn't want any attention until he was ready.
Did Tsia know?
I can't tell.
If I were running from a terrorist,
I would cash in my I.R.A. Not that one.
The other-- you know what I mean.
My point is, Tsia didn't touch that money,
So I don't think she's in on it.
Did you know that Jeremy sold the list to Doyle?
I had my suspicions.
So when you got to D.C., you couldn't trust Tsia, either.
Prentiss read your doubt as duplicity and so did we.
Well, you could have just asked me who Doyle's plant was.
Would you have told me?
No.
Someone we both care about is in trouble.
I need the original profile when Doyle was a terrorist.
We combine that with who he is now as a serial killer.
Agent Hotchner, you took an oath
to protect the laws of your country,
And I took one to protect the secrets of mine.
Do you understand what you're asking?
I know it's not easy.
I'll do it.
If you join me.
You see, there's no catching that man.
He'd escape from your prison as easily as he did North Korea.
And then, all hell breaks loose.
If you want to stop that man,
you have to put a bullet between his eyes yourself.
Can you do that?
Can you break your oath, Agent Hotchner?
No.
Can you take one, then?
Can you swear
that your team will save her?
Yes.
The british consul's here.
Could you tell him I'll be right out?
I'm consulting with the BAU on a case.
Ian Doyle's a power-assertive psychopath,
highly controlling and very explosive
when something doesn't go as planned.
Ok, so how does this fit
in with who he is as a family annihilator?
And Prentiss' role in it.
Annihilators have a romanticized view of who their family is.
Well, actually, he was an orphan.
Well, they think of family as their possession,
until some law shatters that and starts them killing.
But Doyle was never married.
Children?
No.
You run your profile
that he carried out his murders
with surgical-like precision.
Yes.
With no collateral damage.
That's right.
Perhaps this child was a surrogate for one he had.
Say Doyle had a child and you didn't know about it.
Is it possible that Prentiss did?
Then why would she keep it from me?
Who else was in the compound
the day that you arrested Doyle?
Just his staff.
All Irish?
Yeah.
That's a start.
When Fahey told me you were in the city,
he said you already knew where I was.
If that's the truth,
you know what this is about.
Game's over, love.
Time for your last confession.
Take me to where he died.
I want to see it.
Breathe, just breathe.
4, 5, 6...
7, 8,
9, 10.
Ready or not, here I come!
Aww, I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you!
I don't see you. I don't see you.
Aah! I'm gonna get you!
Hi.
Louise.
Come take your boy, please.
You ever think about that?
Having kids?
Be a little hard with what we do, don't you think?
Maybe you need the right man to do it with.
And a son who's crazy about you.
I...I thought
He was your housekeeper's.
Louise raises Declan so no one can use him against me.
But he's mine.
And he needs a mother.
I can't do that.
Not here.
Then I'll get you out.
Or...
I could get you out.
I have resources.
Contacts. He would be safer.
And he'd have a father.
You know what I am, Lauren.
A warrior.
I lead warriors.
I raise warriors.
I can't just leave.
You want me to raise your son
so he can have your life?
Is it that bad a life?
There are so many things
I would do to make you happy.
But...
I can't do this.
Go to your father.
"Go to your father." That's what you said.
I never told anyone the truth about Declan.
You were the only one.
And you put him in your profile, didn't you?
Yes.
For 2 years, I didn't talk.
The North Koreans used everything you gave them against me.
It wasn't until they showed me these...
They laughed at me as I wept.
And you caused all of this, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
That corner right there, that's where he died.
And that's where I'm going to kill you.
There's something you don't know
about those photos.
I got him! I matched Irish immigration records
Based on Doyle's employees. Declan Jones,
He's the only boy who matches.
He settled in Boston 8 years ago,
Adoptive guardian Louise Jones.
I knew louise jones. She was Doyle's housekeeper.
Are they still alive?
Declan and his mother went missing
7 years ago.
Bodies were never found. Wait, what is this? Uh...
God, someone took pictures of them being shot.
Is there an address?
That looks like a warehouse.
It's gotta be big enough to house a small army.
That's weapons, supplies.
Let's see--which means it has its own perimeter.
I got it, 1518 adams street.
After your arrest, I relocated
Louise and Declan.
And then I got a call.
Interpol had sent back our profile.
The head of the terrorism division
wanted more dirt on you so they could break you.
So you used my son as a promotion.
No.
I wouldn't let him be a pawn.
The things they would have done to him
to get you to talk...
But I knew,
even if I didn't cooperate,
They were going to find him eventually.
So I had to-
Had to what?!
I had to end his suffering
before it could begin.
Wait, wait, look at that.
Morgan, come look at this.
What did you do? Uhh!
You put him in the profile. What else did you do?
I put him in the profile
after the pictures were taken.
It's black clothing and a hand, Reid.
No, look at the fingernails.
Oh, my god!
You don't know when those pictures were taken.
You don't know that.
Yes, I do.
I'm the one holding the gun.
You want to hear his lasts words to me?
He said,
"I looked pretty good for a dead kid, didn't I?"
And then he got on the plane
And I never saw him again.
He's alive?!
Just because I held a gun to him
Doesn't mean I shot him.
I only had to make you and the North Koreans
Believe he was dead.
Agent Prentiss is the only friendly in the building.
Rescuing her is our primary objective.
Our only advantage here is stealth.
Once they know we're on site,
There's nothing to stop them from killing her.
So we keep it quiet until we get to her.
I know you're lying!
I beat you, Ian...
Before you even got out of North Korea.
I beat you.
'cause I gave Declan his life back.
I'll find him.
No, you won't.
Ever since you told me my people had Fahey,
I've been stalling you.
Cut the power.
Where is he? Where's Declan, emily?
Tell me. Tell me.
Where is he?
Emily, tell me where he is.
No.
I got her!
I got her in the basement on the south side. I need a medic.
Prentiss.
Derek...
Hey, it's me, I'm right here.
You're gonna be all right.
Stay with me, baby. Come on, stay with me.
Let me go.
No, no. I am not letting you go.
Help me!
Listen to me, I know why you did all of this.
I know what you did for Declan.
I'm so proud of you.
Do you understand that?
I am proud of you because you are my friend,
And you are my partner. No, Emily!
Come on, stay with me.
If you can hear me, please just squeeze my hand.
Yes, there you go. There you go, baby. Just keep squeezing.
No.
She never made it off the table.
Spence.
I didn't get a chance to say good-bye.
Come here.
忠贞 勇敢而正直
Passports from 3 different countries,
And a bank account in each one to keep you comfortable.
Thank you.
Good luck.
