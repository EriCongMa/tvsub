here &apos;s your grilled cheese .
no crust .
cool .
and can you just move your coloring materials , sir ?
look .
pretty .
i was born during the great depression ,
and i never saw anything as depressing
as that grown @-@ ass white boy
coloring in the damn coloring book .
i was born during a def leppard concert ...
and that is the most depressing thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
i &apos;m gonna go school him .
or , in his case , pre @-@ school him .
max , be gentle .
i think he &apos;s in the middle of his terrible 32s .
excuse me , oshkosh b &apos;gosh .
i have a question about your coloring book .
why ?
oh , they &apos;re for adults .
super zen .
super meditative .
helps with stress .
you know what else helps with stress ?
sex .
and even if someone could get past
those boner @-@ killing overalls ...
you ain &apos;t gonna have any of that if you keep this up .
not to mention , how stressful can your life really be
if you are carefully shading a unicorn &apos;s ass
3 : 00 p.m. on a tuesday ?
pickup . veggie wrap .
oh , my god , he &apos;s having sex .
oh , caroline , don &apos;t be such a prude .
oh , good , it &apos;s sophie .
i was worried he was at that bagel again .
who says that a pregnant woman can &apos;t have sex
on the kitchen floor of a diner ?
the health department , sophie .
oh boy , sex makes me thirsty .
she just blew right past those cups .
sophie , having sex with you pregnant
is even hotter than having sex when you had the bird flu .
yeah , well , you know , i &apos;m just as sweaty ,
but i sneeze less .
sophie , you &apos;re really not letting
this pregnancy slow you down .
you &apos;ve already had more sex just today
than caroline &apos;s had all year .
you &apos;re not even in maternity clothes .
yeah .
well , i don &apos;t need to wear one of those frumpy potato sacks .
yeah , because i &apos;m a hot potato !
earl , what are you looking at ?
i have no idea .
all right , max ...
it &apos;s time to have that uncomfortable conversation again .
okay , but i thought you said it was a hard no
on having sex in front of the today show window ?
oh , come on .
my month here is almost up .
i have to get back to l.a. , and we need a plan .
we have a plan .
i use the nuvaring i found at the burlington coat factory .
they really are more than great coats .
max , let &apos;s get real .
max doesn &apos;t like to talk about reality
unless it &apos;s reality tv .
like the cops new orleans episode she was on .
it &apos;s the only time fox has ever aired a nipple .
uh , who ordered the korean boy band ?
uh , can i help you ?
yeah , hi .
i &apos;m looking for han lee .
&apos;bout yay big .
&apos;bout yay stupid .
you &apos;re looking for han ?
just han , or are you trying to collect the whole set ?
you kind of look like this korean pop star named bong .
well , my bong is from korea .
uh , han is not here .
well , if you see him ,
just tell him hwang came to say ,
if he doesn &apos;t call me back , he &apos;s got three strikes
and no balls .
oh , he knows that .
oh , my god , do you think han may be in some sort of trouble ?
i &apos;m really worried .
oh , j. crew sale !
so , after we pay the painters , the electrician , the plumber ,
and , of course , the bribes to the inspectors ,
we have just enough money left for what i like to call
a little &quot; cash cush . &quot;
if that &apos;s cash we use for kush , i &apos;m excited about it .
we can &apos;t spend that money , so pretend it &apos;s not there ,
like you do with recycling bins .
oh , no !
the rats are using our tarp as their superdome again !
i &apos;ll get the rat mallet !
no , don &apos;t get the rat mallet !
it &apos;s a talking one , get the gun .
well , if it isn &apos;t crouching loser , hidden virgin .
girls , i &apos;m in a bit of hot water .
what happened , you fell into a tea cup again ?
no , i &apos;m in deep trouble !
you &apos;ve never been in deep anything .
well , wait , is that why those scary @-@ looking guys
came into the diner looking for you
and made some threats ?
i remember something about a strike and no balls .
something about no balls ?
you monsters didn &apos;t get the precise wording
on a threat to my life ?
i was a little distracted , han .
j. crew claimed to have a 50 % off sale ,
but then i clicked on the link , and it was an &quot; up to &quot; 50 % sale .
mostly on men &apos;s suiting .
oh , do send me the link
so i can select the suit i &apos;ll be buried in !
because you two can &apos;t take a damn message !
all right , han , what is going on ?
are you really in trouble ?
what was that ?
help me , strong , big man !
that wasn &apos;t gunshots , han ,
it was just a car backfiring .
what &apos;s going on ?
well , there &apos;s no easy way to say it .
i have a pretty substantial gambling problem .
but han , that &apos;s almost interesting .
yeah , and i &apos;m almost history !
in case you weren &apos;t following ,
i &apos;m in a lot of debt !
han , my man , i &apos;m here for you .
tell us what it is .
poker , ponies , football ?
it &apos;s ...
ladies tennis .
ladies tennis ?
i didn &apos;t even know you played tennis .
yeah , well , it &apos;s a vicious sport .
and i lost most of my money on those williams sisters .
never trust a big butt and a smile .
you &apos;re telling me !
i thought the bad one was the good one .
how much do you owe these people ?
well , with the initial debt and the interest .
i &apos;m told it &apos;s in the neighborhood
of a black market kidney .
those are pretty pricey .
i know , i have two of them .
han , that &apos;s fascinating ,
yet disturbing .
like when you use a black light at a red roof inn .
you &apos;re like an enigma .
enigma , please .
han , how dangerous can hwang be ?
his office is in a karaoke bar .
the only thing he &apos;s gonna murder
is the hall and oates catalogue .
han , you have to face this bully .
and this is coming from your biggest bully .
now come on , do what i say , or i &apos;ll beat you up .
here we go .
oh , i just remembered ... i need to get my sweater .
from my home .
in korea .

he looks busy .
let &apos;s revisit this in september .
oh , i see we have company .
come in , sit down , give me my money .
look , mr. hwang .
we understand han has a weakness for pleated white skirts
and over @-@ developed thighs .
slow down , let me handle this .
i have experience with hardened criminals .
first off , killer carly rae jeps .
um , do you mind if a sister does , like , five shots ?
look , mr. hwang .
call me by my first name : hwang .
your names is hwang hwang ?
oh , you think that &apos;s funny ?
so did kim .
kim , show them your mangled genitals .
we &apos;re all set , mangled genitals @-@ wise .
speak for yourself , i &apos;d take a peek at them mangled gennies .
uh , perhaps we could put an installment plan in place
for the money han owes you ?
how much is it , exactly ?
$ 30,000 .
on ladies tennis ?
i &apos;m sure we can figure this out .
yeah , i have a free pass to any amc theatre .
i should warn you , though , it does exclude the imax .
keep it , han .
i &apos;ve decided to give you a little time to pay me back .
that is so cool of you .
how much time ?
uh , one song .
right now .
and han ?
you better make it a toe @-@ tapper .
&apos;cause when you &apos;re done ,
you &apos;ll have one less toe to tap .
you &apos;re not really gonna take off his toes .
kim , show him your missing toes .
come on , han , it &apos;s show time .
i mean , &quot; toe time . &quot;
oh , my god , this is like when they make people sing
on american idol after they &apos;ve been voted off .
hwang , what are you gonna do with another toe ?
i mean , you think you need another one ,
and then they just sit on the shelf .
if i don &apos;t take his toes , then i &apos;m known as the guy
who says he &apos;s gonna take toes and then doesn &apos;t take toes .
uh , can i peruse a song book ?
it might take a while , i &apos;m very picky .
abba ...
ac / dc ...
adele ...
i already picked you a song .
&quot; last dance &quot; by donna summer .
&apos;cause when that toe is gone ,
it &apos;ll be the last time you dance .
sing .
♪ last dance ♪
♪ last chance for love ♪
♪ yes it &apos;s my last chance ♪
♪ for romance ♪
♪ tonight ♪
♪ i need you ♪
♪ by me ♪

♪ to guide me ♪
what are we gonna do ?
you heard han .
he needs us by him , beside him , to guide him !
should we go and get the cops ?
no , by the time they get back ,
han will have one less toe ,
if hwang even stops there .
what if he takes his whole foot ?
han needs all the height he can get .
didn &apos;t you say something about us having a money cushion ?
we can &apos;t use the cushion .
we need it for the dessert bar in case we have a slow start .
like we have had with every business we &apos;ve started before .
you sure ? &apos; cause ...
♪ don &apos;t leave ♪
♪ scold me ♪
♪ &apos; cause when i &apos;m bad ♪
♪ i &apos;m so so bad ♪
leaning towards helping .
han is annoying , nerdy , bad at sports ,
but he gave us a cushion when we didn &apos;t have anything .
max , i want to help han ,
but i also don &apos;t want us to wind up with nothing .
again .
let me see him one more time .
♪ so let &apos;s dance ♪
♪ let &apos;s dance ♪
♪ let &apos;s dance ♪

can i start over ?
i had a bubble in my throat .
chestnut , we have big news .
and something called mochi .
in here .
i let myself in .
chestnut can talk ?
thank you , god !
what &apos;s up , good looking ?
i still can &apos;t believe
you &apos;re dating someone who looks like that ,
and can read .
randy , you will not believe what we did .
we saved han &apos;s life .
well , not his life , so much as his toe ,
but still an amazing gesture on our part .
long story about a short guy ,
we bought the diner .
i had to get something out of it .
i mean , i &apos;m not mother teresa .
you bought the diner ?
the diner that doesn &apos;t show up on google maps
for legal reasons ?
that diner ?
why would you do that ?
well , not bought , exactly .
we got han out of debt in exchange for part ownership .
it &apos;s like , we spend five years trying to get out of hell ,
and then ...
we bought hell !
crazy , right ?
yeah , no , real crazy .
when i think of impulse buys , i think of altoids
or a flashlight keychain .
well , i guess congratulations .
wait , what is that look on your face ?
i &apos;ve never seen it before .
are you mad ?
just surprised you didn &apos;t think
to talk to me about it first .
what , every time i buy a diner , i have to tell you ?
i go back to l.a. in three days .
you couldn &apos;t make a plan for that ,
but you bought the diner ?
that &apos;s a commitment .
now it &apos;s done .
i should go tell chestnut what we did .
&apos;cause he is gonna laugh .
i know what &apos;ll make this all okay .
some jug snugs ?
yours , not mine .
nothing ?
well , if we &apos;re not gonna do it ,
at least put on a shirt .
i am human .
you really think you &apos;re gonna have time for us ?
starting a new business and owning the diner ?
yes !
i had four jobs in sixth grade ,
and i still had time to follow smash mouth around the country .
not the band , a meth head my mom really liked .
chestnut had a big reaction to the news , as well .
where &apos;s the poop shovel ?
hey , boss ladies , congratulations !
i heard that you own the diner now .
which is why i am doing double doobies .
part ! part owners !
i &apos;m still the boss .
put that away !
doobie continued .
who &apos;s the boss , tiny danza ?
男主角名叫 &quot; 托尼 · 丹扎 &quot;
well , i will be again , as soon as i scrape up
the money to pay you back .
but don &apos;t worry , from now on ,
i &apos;m not gambling on anything
but lunch at chipotle .
hey , everybody !
sophie &apos;s back and better than ever !
like racism in america .
i heard that .
wow , sophie , that is some dress .
and there must be one very cold leopard out there .
oh , i like your style , baby .
i realized
i don &apos;t need to wear those basic bitch maternity clothes .
i can be maternal without losing that little whisper
that says , &quot; i &apos;m doable . &quot;
yes , you are .
she also made a maternity item for the bedroom .
it &apos;s called &quot; the preglige . &quot;
hey , oleg .
meet me in the bathroom .
hey , earl , i &apos;m heading out .
i guess we &apos;ll never get to do that lethal weapon reboot
we talked about .
that &apos;s all right , i &apos;m doing a rush hour reboot with han .
what &apos;re you doing with that luggage ?
did i get you kicked out of another hotel ?
no , i changed my ticket .
going back to l.a. today .
but that &apos;s today .
and that is a ticket to los angeles .
use it whenever you want and i &apos;ll be there .
this is empty .
yeah , everything &apos;s done online now .
i just did that for effect .
you &apos;ll get an email .
good luck with your dessert bar and the diner .
i &apos;m gonna see you .
yeah .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
why are you being so good @-@ bye @-@ y ?
i &apos;m gonna visit as soon as things get settled here .
and we &apos;ll talk every day .
i &apos;m even better at phone sex than i am at real sex .
i find that hard to believe .
it &apos;s the only thing on my resume that &apos;s not a lie .
i &apos;ll figure it out . we &apos;ll make a plan .
i know you think that .
but i think i was right the first time .
long @-@ distance relationships don &apos;t work .
and i think the real distance between us
is where we are in our lives .
what distance ?
i &apos;m three inches away from you .
you better get back to your diner .
i love you , max .
i love you , too .
okay , that felt really good @-@ bye @-@ y .
i &apos;m okay , earl .
this is for me .
i know this is really hard ,
but you don &apos;t know where this all is gonna end up .
like you , when you ride the subway on ecstasy .
are you okay ?
i am the opposite of okay .
you know , as the boss , i could let you take a break .
i mean , ten minutes , tops .
if i give you more than ten minutes ,
then i &apos;ll be known as the girl who says
she &apos;s gonna give ten minutes , then doesn &apos;t give ten minutes .
i need to talk to the owner .
that &apos;s me !
oh , that was really painful .
and probably worse than losing a toe .
