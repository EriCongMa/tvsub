look , i know you &apos;r tired .
but just think how good you &apos;re gonna feel tomorrow
when you wake up and we have all new shop paper .
i wish i didn &apos;t get what you are talking about .
but i do . i just do .
hey , who could be calling at this hour ?
it &apos;s sal .
no . not answering that .
whatever earth @-@ shattering drama she &apos;s going through can wait .
until she gets here .
oh , god . i hope we have vodka .
we don &apos;t , mitchell .
sal was our best girlfriend
from back in our party days ,
but over the years , we &apos;ve kind of gone in different directions .
we chose forward .
why won &apos;t this open ?
uh , something &apos;s wrong with that door .
okay , whatever . i have the most amazing news ,
and i &apos;m super excited ,
but i won &apos;t be if you don &apos;t want me to be .
ready ?
i &apos;m getting married !
oh , my gosh ! congratulations !
i know !
who &apos;s the guy ?
oh , the love of my life .
oh , so you finally bagged your boss ?
oh ! yes , but it &apos;s not him . and i don &apos;t work there anymore .
his name is tony .
i met him three months ago .
he &apos;s the greatest guy ever .
and seriously , are you guys okay with this ?
of course . why wouldn &apos;t we be ?
well , you know , because i can get married ,
and you guys ... ugh ! can &apos;t .
so ? that doesn &apos;t mean you shouldn &apos;t .
really ? because i will not go through with it
if you don &apos;t want me to . seriously .
not necessary . i mean , what kind of people would we be
if we denied you or anyone the right to marry ?
# politics .
this makes me so happy
because i want you two to be my best men .
yes ! yes !
of course !
okay . the wedding is gonna be super cute ,
just us , a little dinner after .
oh , and it &apos;s next friday .
oh . what , it &apos;s next friday ?
yeah .
how will we have time to do best man stuff ?
you know , like help you pick out your dress ,
get your flowers , get our hair blown out ?
he &apos;s never been a best man before .
oh , my god , we &apos;re getting married !
we &apos;re getting married ! let &apos;s have a drink .
yeah , we &apos;re out of vodka .
i will see you on friday .
and initial here and here and here .
ay , my arm is starting to hurt .
just a couple more .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing . i have to get this package ,
but there &apos;s so much signing .
get out of here , you perv .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
you don &apos;t do that in front of strangers .
at least throw a blanket over .
i am not ashamed .
obviously .
they &apos;re out all the time--
in front of manny , at the club ,
at claire &apos;s dinner the other day .
phil almost ate a candle .
fine . next time , i will feed your baby inside a dark closet .
i &apos;m just saying pick your moments , huh ?
like let daliya open the door . that &apos;s why we hired her .
daliya ?
my mother raised six children
while working at a construction job .
she would be so ashamed if i had a nanny .
i don &apos;t see a lot of shame from your mom
when she &apos;s cashing my checks every month .
hey , daliya , we gotta go see manny &apos;s teacher .
would you try to coax a burp out of this one ?
come here , little guy .
can you hold him a little higher ?
i will . i &apos;m just letting him get settled in .
okay , we &apos;re going . bye @-@ bye , joe .
he likes to bounce a little .
can you cup your hand
so that he doesn &apos;t feel like you &apos;re slapping ?
okay .
she knows it . stop micromanaging .
cup your hand .
hello .
hey .
hey , can one of you guys drive me to my cello thing tonight ?
honey , i wish we &apos;d known .
yeah . we got a dinner thing with the flendersons .
okay , you don &apos;t have to stay ,
and those aren &apos;t even real people .
sorry . i panicked .
i got stuck between the flemings and the hendersons .
oh , my god . are those new boots ?
yes .
i love them . they &apos;re so cute !
they are ?
oh , i forgot to tell you--
danielle gunston--first one in my class to get pregnant .
you totally called it .
did you hear that ?
my money was on denise modick .
no . first she complimented my fashion sense ,
then she told me i did something right .
phil , i think it &apos;s happening .
raising a kid is like sending a rocket ship to the moon .
you spend the early years in constant contact ,
and then one day , around the teenage years ,
they go around the dark side and they &apos;re gone .
all you can do is wait for that faint signal
that says they &apos;re coming back .
i think haley is sending me that signal .
and ?
and phil gave me that analogy .
yeah .
you know what ?
i think i &apos;m gonna ask her out to dinner tonight .
do you think she &apos;ll say yes ?
if you want ,
i can pass her a note in study hall .
what did i do ?
oh , my god . nothing .
i just wanted to know , if you weren &apos;t busy ,
you know , if you wanted to have dinner with me tonight ?
dinner ? just you and me ?
i mean , you don &apos;t have to . it &apos;s cool . don &apos;t worry .
no , sounds fun . let &apos;s do it .
okay . let &apos;s meet by the front door , then .
you know , 7 : 00 ?
okay .
yeah .
i totally think she likes you !
i think so , too .
first of all , i just want to say what a pleasure it is
to have manny in art class .
he &apos;s talented--
can we just skip to what he did wrong ?
who said that he did something wrong ?
hit it .
we do have an issue .
told you .
manny seems to have quite a fascination
with the female nude .
so ? he &apos;s a romantic .
well , this is all his art work over the last few weeks .
holy moly .
there were even more ,
but i think the janitor took some home .
look at this .
and this .
and these .
look , i &apos;m an artist . i &apos;m free .
i used to have an earring up here .
but some of the other parents have complained .
well , the moms .
he must have learned that at school .
because we have filters in the computer ,
and i have thrown out all of jay magazines .
don &apos;t know what she &apos;s talking about .
there is no way that manny has seen this sort of thing at our home .
we &apos;ll take it from here .
hey , buddy .
it &apos;s just you and me tonight .
sounds good . i &apos;ll be right down .
all right .
i knew it ! what are you hiding ?
porn .
don &apos;t lie to me !
fine .
i &apos;m trying to send a message to a girl on facebook ,
but she &apos;s so out of my league .
look at her .
oh , yeah . she &apos;s cute .
i &apos;ve been sitting here forever
and i can &apos;t think of anything to say .
well , you are in luck .
if anyone knows the art of wooing the fairer sex ,
it &apos;s this guy .
&quot; hey . &quot;
wait !
send .
why did you type that ?
now she knows i &apos;m thinking about her .
smiley face .
oh , my god . stop now .
we can only screw it up from here .
please . you &apos;re in the hands of the master .
i think i know how to pick up a 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl ...
for you .
&quot; what &apos;s the haps tonight ? &quot;
boop .
&quot; what &apos;s the haps tonight &quot; ? nobody says that .
&quot; going to the mall . wanna meet ? &quot;
&quot; dinner at rosa grill in an hour ? &quot;
question mark . boom !
kids don &apos;t eat dinner .
what do you mean , you don &apos;t eat dinner ?
what do you do ?
i don &apos;t know . you just walk around and jump off stuff .
you can &apos;t invite a girl to jump off stuff .
well , it &apos;s way better than--
&quot; see ya then . x.o. &quot;
you &apos;re in , buddy .
i gotta get ready .
all right , let &apos;s go before this wears off .
i think we have a few days .
well , thank you , dimples .
oh , you better get that out of your system ,
&apos;cause in two hours , you &apos;re gonna be ...
mrs. anthony lombardo .
so does this italian of yours cook ?
in every room of the house ,
if you know what i mean !
we have a lot of sex .
yeah . got it .
okay , now let &apos;s have a proper toast . all right .
to wild sal .
you gave it a good run ,
but like every legendary gunslinger ,
there comes a time when you need to holster your weapons
and ride off into the sunset .
but you took on every man who came to town .
i really did !
you sure did .
also , you know , i &apos;m just getting married .
i &apos;m not dying .
no , no . we &apos;re just happy you &apos;re happy .
and we &apos;re excited that we &apos;re gonna get to see
so much more of you now .
yes . we &apos;ll be couple friends .
we &apos;ll go to movies ... take classes ...
oh , our game nights on saturday ...
huge .
they &apos;re epic , yeah .
do you play cranium ?
well , if i &apos;m playing board games on a saturday night ,
you can shoot me in my cranium .
but i love you !
i need to take a whiz .
i &apos;m so happy for her .
i think we might have freaked her out , though .
oh , no , mitchell . come on . you &apos;re a smart man ,
but you are awful at reading people .
sal &apos;s been different this week .
that is a woman in love .
looks like a woman in love .
look , nobody &apos;s as happy as i am about you loving the ladies .
all i &apos;m saying is , you gotta pull back a little .
okay .
ay , manny ,
this is all my fault .
i am too free with my body .
it was okay when you were a little boy , but ...
was it ?
but now that you &apos;re a young man ,
and ...
i didn &apos;t hear a word they said .
all i could think about was daliya .
every drawing , every poem ,
every historical novel i wrote was for her .
she was my muse .
toss in a body that doesn &apos;t quit ,
and i think we got a soul mate .
so there &apos;s a lot of other things you can draw .
you &apos;ve got your landscapes . you &apos;ve got your bowls of fruit .
trees .
a barn . the ladies with the fruit on the head .
i said fruit .
but you didn &apos;t say the ladies with the fruit on the head .
i &apos;m trying to get him away from the ladies .
ah , good . good . good .
this is so stupid .
what if i spill on her ,
or accidentally brush my boob against her hand ?
i mean her hand against my boob .
dude , stay cool . you got this .
i &apos;m gonna be at the bar the whole time .
if you start to panic , just come get me .
shh . there she is .
what was that ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve never heard it before .
try not to let that happen again .
hi , luke .
pretty good .
uh , i mean , hi , simone .
uh , this is my dad .
dad , this is luke .
you &apos;re funny .
looking .
clutch .
what are you still doing here ?
what the hell got into me ?
besides the bartender &apos;s tongue ?
yes . yes , well , that was a little inappropriate .
but let &apos;s not overreact .
it &apos;s perfectly natural to have a panic attack
before making a big life decision .
what if it &apos;s the wrong decision ?
what if tony &apos;s not the guy ?
what if he &apos;s the guy ?
or him ? he is cute . when did he come in ?
okay , you need to focus , sal .
you are about to make a sacred , lifelong commitment .
you are not making this better !
oh , god , it &apos;s tony .
i &apos;m supposed to pick him up and drive him to the wedding ?
everybody shut up for a second !
okay , you know what ? i &apos;m gonna marry him .
what &apos;s the worst that can happen ? i get a divorce .
people do it all the time .
oh , you &apos;re suffocating me !
it is not too late . you are not married yet .
you &apos;re right .
okay . that &apos;s good . get it all out .
here . stand up .
okay , mom ?
mom . mom . oh , my god , mom , i think i got it .
i &apos;ve been lugging this thing around for ten years .
okay . well , you sure you don &apos;t want us to stay
and--and hear you play ?
mm , that &apos;s okay .
yeah , i agreed to dinner ,
not tickets to the electric light dorkestra .
don &apos;t be so mean to your sister .
no , that &apos;s our band &apos;s name .
so you wanna go back to that vegan place ?
ooh . leather jacket . can &apos;t take the hate .
haley !
gabby ! what are you doing here ?
i just stopped in for a bump of coffee
before i meet up with zoe and those guys at noodlecat .
do you wanna go ?
so what &apos;s--what &apos;s noodlecat ?
oh , it &apos;s this really cool asian place
that sells , like , a million different kinds of noodles .
and hopefully , no cat .
well , that sounds cool .
so you don &apos;t mind if i go ?
oh , i kind of thought we had plans .
oh . yeah . you &apos;re right .
so i can meet you guys there after .
how long are you gonna be there ?
no .
it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s fine . go .
i &apos;ll stay and watch alex .
oh , now i feel bad .
love you !
excuse me .
you &apos;re luke &apos;s dad , aren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m valerie , simone &apos;s mom .
oh . phil .
hi .
i recognized you
from when you hosted the school &apos;s talent night .
you were incredibly limber .
ah , when you wear the right pants .
please , sit down .
thank you .
yeah .
so how is the big date going ?
i don &apos;t know .
simone was so nervous .
when they were chatting on the computer ,
i had to write everything for her .
that &apos;s so funny . i did the same thing for luke .
so the whole time we were talking to each other ?
wait , does that make this our date ?
well , a good father , funny , handsome .
a girl could do a lot worse .
you know what , mitchell ?
forgive me if my missouri is showing ,
but what she is doing is not marriage .
it &apos;s a mockery of marriage . it &apos;s mockerage .
and i &apos;m gonna stop it .
no , no , you &apos;re not .
i can &apos;t help but think you &apos;re infusing the situation
with just a touch of your own frustration .
why , because we &apos;ve built a life together for the last ten years ?
because we &apos;re raising a child ?
or because i was the first person to think of doing
an elaborately choreographed dance at our wedding ,
and now it &apos;s been done to death ?
makes you feel any better ,
i was never gonna do that .
but ... i get it .
well , you know what ? she can &apos;t get married
if the best man doesn &apos;t hand over the wedding ring .
you wouldn &apos;t .
yes , i would .
where is it ? give it to me .
give me the ring . cam .
stop . stop .
you have to give me ...
oh , well , this is a mystery solved .
thank you !
okay . let &apos;s go do this .
okay .
how hot does tony look ?
on a scale of 1 to bartender , or ...
reel it in , cam .
i think this is broken .
we &apos;re gonna have to find another spot .
no , we &apos;ll be late for the movie .
are you sure you &apos;re doing it right ?
we both know i know how to use a credit card .
all right , i &apos;ll put a note on the meter .
let me get a piece of paper .
maybe this is a bad sign .
maybe i &apos;m not supposed to be in the movie theater .
i &apos;m supposed to be at home with my babies .
honey , we know that daliya knows how to take care of joe .
and what about manny ? he &apos;s supposed to run his own bath ?
you know , considering what &apos;s been going on with him ,
it might be good for you to give him a little space .
i mean , this was his idea .
what was ?
that we go out tonight ,
so that we could get some alone time .
oh , that &apos;s sweet .
uh @-@ oh .
what ?
we gotta get home . look--manny &apos;s notebook .
more drawings and a poem-- &quot; ode to daliya . &quot;
so those were not my boobs ? they were daliya &apos;s boobs ?
yep . this is not a &quot; nude descending a staircase , &quot;
this is a &quot; nude vacuuming a staircase . &quot;
okay , manny . joe &apos;s asleep .
what do you want for dinner ?
actually , already taken care of .
you shouldn &apos;t play with your food .
what are you doing here ?
i knew you were upset i left ,
and i felt bad , so i came back ,
you &apos;re here out of guilt ?
i know . i &apos;m growing up .
why are you rolling your eyes at me ?
i &apos;m doing a nice thing .
because i want you to be here because you wantto be here .
okay , you &apos;re being really needy right now .
oh , my god . are you going through the change ?
stop asking me that every time i express an emotion .
and no , i am not . it &apos;s just so damn hot in here .
i am disappointed , that &apos;s all .
when you were little , we used to do everything together .
and i thought maybe you were coming back around ,
and we could be friends again .
i just ... miss being part of my daughter &apos;s life .
hey , everybody . thanks for coming .
i thought this was supposed to be some sort of classical thing .
me , too .
she sings ?
i don &apos;t even know who that is .
oh , my god , phil , you are hilarious .
yep . that &apos;s how i got my wife of 20 years .
could we get the check , please ?
oh , i got this .
ooh , funny and generous .
if my husband were more like you ...
maybe i &apos;d still be married .
well , if my wife were here ,
she &apos;d want me to be clear that i &apos;m fully committed to her .
you know that , right ?
what ?
no , i just wanna make sure ,
because you unbuttoned a button ,
and i ... love my wife , so--
you were the one who was flirting
and saying we &apos;re on a date .
that was a joke ,
but i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry if i misled you at all .
thank you .
but there was a lot of touching .
i touched your shoulder for a second .
no , it was more of a stroke , like this--
okay . i &apos;m so sorry
for touching your hand with my boob .
i mean my boob with your hand .
is this your little game ?
you cop a feel on a sad divorcee
and then pretend i &apos;m the one coming on to you ?
how does that feel ?
oh . weird .
you like it ? yeah ?
little bit of that ?
yeah .
little bit of whoa . no .
you probably like this . don &apos;t you ?
oh , stop it . your daughter &apos;s right over there .
my minivan is right outside .
that is not what i meant .
this pizza is delicious .
i like it , too . we have so much in common .
have you seen the back of your menu ?
&quot; with silken hair and supple olive skin
and hands that wash the laundry of my kin ... &quot;
oh , manny ...
you still have 12 lines to go .
spoiler alert-- i love you .
okay , back away from the nanny .
oh , my god , it looks like a madonna video in here !
why aren &apos;t you at the movies ?
we need to talk right now .
what have you done to my son ? !
i didn &apos;t--
she didn &apos;t do anything .
why do you have to embarrass me ?
embarrass you ? maybe if you didn &apos;t fall in love ...
stop this !
you &apos;re going to wake the baby .
now manny and i are having a private discussion .
so please , give us a minute .
i &apos;ll give you your minute right this minute .
gloria . gloria .
go ahead , manny .
i &apos;m not saying we need to do anything right away .
i &apos;m just asking you to wait a few years .
you are so sweet .
whoever ends up with you
is the luckiest woman in the world .
that could be you .
no .
i am unlucky , because i was born too soon .
and i can &apos;t have you wait around .
poets have to live .
besides , in a few years , you &apos;ll feel differently .
you &apos;re wrong . i &apos;ll feel this way for the rest of my life .
well , manny , wait .
ay , manny , papito lindo--
leave me alone .
sorry about that .
don &apos;t be . it &apos;s the sweetest offer i &apos;ve ever gotten .
i am so sorry that i screamed at you .
it was so nice what you told him in there .
i take manny , you take the little one ?
okay .
you probably just--
she knows what to do , jay .
tiramisu .
i love his tiramisu .
marriage is a promise .
it says to the world that you share a love
and a commitment to each other
that will only grow deeper as the years go by .
now have you two written vows ?
yeah , i &apos;ll go .
marriage terrifies me .
take mitch and cam .
i used to think their life looked so boring .
i could never do it . pay bills ? wash dishes ?
wake up to the same face every day ?
i felt sorry for them .
where is this headed ?
but they &apos;re not bored .
it turns out when you &apos;re with the right person ,
you can change shelf paper at 10 : 00 at night in your pajamas
and not wanna be anywhere else .
that &apos;s how much they love each other .
we sure do .
and when i just saw your face ,
i remembered ...
that &apos;s how much i love you .
thanks for being here .
we wouldn &apos;t be anywhere else , sal .
and do you have anything prepared ?
hit me , baby .
i made out with a stripper last night .
sorry . i just wanna start this clean .
i made out with a bartender ... an hour ago .
you &apos;re not just saying that to make me feel better , are you ?
back me up . didn &apos;t i ?
she totally did .
i totally did !
yeah . he was hot , too .
he was very good @-@ looking .
nice .
well . that was different .
who &apos;s got the ring ?
i do .
hand &apos; em over .
thank you guys so much .
alex , honey , amazing .
why didn &apos;t you tell us ?
oh , i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
that was so good .
if i didn &apos;t know you ,
i &apos;d be all like , &quot; that chick is cool . &quot;
hey , guys , hi . i &apos;m alex &apos;s mom .
you were terrific .
hey , and i &apos;m her sister .
we &apos;re gonna go get some dinner .
do you wanna come with us ?
you can bring your friends from the band .
um , no , thanks . we &apos;re actually going out ,
and i have a ride home , so see you guys later .
okay .
oh , my god . sorry about that .
did she just apologize for us ?
yep .
but we were just being nice .
sucks , doesn &apos;t it ?
luke , i &apos;m sorry simone &apos;s mom dragged her away so fast .
it &apos;s okay . i was running out of things to say .
guess i kind of blew it for you , didn &apos;t i ?
no . now that her mom doesn &apos;t want her going out with me anymore ,
simone wants me more than ever .
i guess she &apos;s heading into a rebellious stage .
best time to get &apos; em .
never be afraid to go after a girl who &apos;s out of your league .
i did . that &apos;s how i got your mom .
yeah , i always wondered how you pulled that one off .
she was in a rebellious stage , too .
yep , grandpa wasn &apos;t always as crazy about me as he is now .
i &apos;m gonna go pop the champagne and get some glasses .
i &apos;ll help .
i &apos;m gonna get cranium .
sorry you couldn &apos;t come to the wedding .
it was no kids .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll go to your next one .
she--she just means when
she &apos;s not a kid anymore , you know ?
she knows what i mean .
i don &apos;t like you .
i &apos;ll get over it .
