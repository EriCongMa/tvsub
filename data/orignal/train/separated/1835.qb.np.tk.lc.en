i &apos;ve seen a lot of surgery residents
come and go in my time .
and they &apos;re all addicted to surgery .
it comes before food , before sleep ,
it becomes the most important thing .
what ?
nothing .
well , go away !
you look nice .
go away .
the only thing
what they don &apos;t know is that living on that high ...
can eat them alive .
i can &apos;t do it .
of course you can .
oh , my god . i &apos;m gonna hurl again .
okay , please don &apos;t , &apos; cause i
just got the last of the puke out of your hair .
why do i have to do this ? i &apos;m not a public speaker .
it &apos;s not my thing . god , i hate derek shepherd .
all you have to do is talk about being a great surgeon .
to a giant room full of people ... from a giant stage .
oh , god . with a microphone .
some make it through .
they come out on the other side .
they survive with their sanity intact .
they become ... better doctors
and stronger people .
i didn &apos;t .
i broke .
i didn &apos;t kill anybody .
and i give thanks for that every day .
but i hurt people ,
and scared the hell out of myself .
i am 45 days sober today .
i am richard ,
and i am a grateful and recovering alcoholic .
i was told if i went to rehab ,
my job would be waiting for me .
pending board approval .
i &apos;m sorry , richard .
you know , maybe they &apos;ll reassess in a few months .
i &apos;ve been authorized to offer you a position
as an attending general surgeon .
you want me to come work under you ?
yes , that &apos;s the stipulation .
thanks for the offer , but , no .
i &apos;ll figure something else out .
richard , it &apos;s lecture day , and i have an open spot .
lecture day ? you brought that back ?
look , i understand if you don &apos;t want to come back .
but if you &apos;re really gonna leave this place ,
don &apos;t leave it the way you did . give one last lecture .
good morning .
good morning .
good morning , everybody .
good morning .
i &apos;m excited .
are you excited ?
this is a , uh , teaching hospital .
we learn a lot by doing .
we can also learn- we should also learn-
from other people &apos;s experiences .
their losses
will save you losses .
their mistakes will save you mistakes .
their victories will inspire yours .
let &apos;s pay close attention . this is gonna be good .
dr. miranda bailey .
good morning , everyone .
good morning .
morning , dr. yang .
what the ...
if i have to stand here , you have to listen .
eyes forward .
answer a question right , you get a chocolate .
doze off , you get beaned in the face
ask dr. yang . my aim is exceptional .
2003 ...
i &apos;m three days into my intern year .
anyone ?
alicia tatum ,
status post @-@ oophorectomy three months ago ,
now presents with fever and nonfocal abdominal pain .
okay . what does her workup show ?
multiple stones and wall thickening .
excu @-@ excuse me ?
multiple gallbladder stones and wall thickening .
would you recommd we do it open or laparoscopically ?
laparoscopically .
uh , who said that ?
who @-@ who said that ?
sir .
you &apos;ve , uh , had a pretty rough go of it , huh ?
nothing helps the pain
i &apos;ve seen more doctors than i can count .
hopefully we &apos;ll be the last ... eight .
we &apos;re gonna get to the bottom of this , okay ?
let &apos;s prep her for surgery .
you .
mandy .
mandy ? that &apos;s what you &apos;re going with ?
boy , your parents really wanted you to work for it , huh ?
draw some blood and take her for her pre @-@ op x @-@ ray .
uh , uh , well , i was wondering
blood draw is too much for you ?
no . i can draw blood . i- i @-@ i just wanted-
you don &apos;t have wants or needs .
you &apos;re an intern @-@ the bottom of the surgical food chain .
i am a resident .
i &apos;ve been here three years . you &apos;ve been here three days .
do the math . draw her blood .
is she shaking ?
she &apos;s definitely shaking .
okay . oh , she &apos;s doing her pee dance .
she does that when she has to pee .
okay , well , is she gonna pee right now ?
oh . no , no , no .
that &apos;s not the right ...
okay .
beautiful .
&quot; in my third year as a resident , i was &quot; -
can &apos;t hear you ! speak louder , please !
&quot; in mthird year as a resident , i ...
&quot; was presented with a patient named sunder ... &quot;
&quot; atluri ,
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old grad ... &quot;
&quot; student from india . &quot;
uh , hey . i &apos;m from ortho . i was paged .
you were paged by me . alex karev .
you have to put me on this case .
um , here &apos;s a news flash , overly enthusiastic intern guy .
i don &apos;t have to do anything .
oh , come on .
you seem like a cool person .
you don &apos;t know me .
well , you look like a cool person .
i need some cool cases .
ever since the elevator thing and heart guy , it &apos;s just ...
wait , that was you ?
you &apos;re the heart @-@ in @-@ the @-@ elevator guy ?
sure . let &apos;s go with that .
you &apos;re not at all how i pictured you .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i heard the story- the heart in the elevator .
it was basically &quot; rudy , &quot; you know @-@ dorky guy makes good .
but you &apos;re not dorky. you &apos;re hot .
maybe i was dorky before i saved the cop in the elevator .
maybe my unbelievable skill under pressure
transformed me completely .
hmm . did it ?
does that turn you on ?
no . but this does .
the chief .
good @-@ good morning .
once up on a time ...
long before i was chief of surgery ,
even before i was an attending ,
i was a resident right here at seattle grace ,
just like you .
you learn from everything in your residency-
the patients , the nurses ,
the attendings .
but you don &apos;t realize
how much you learn from each other .
1982- you were all in diapers .
give me the chart on 23 @-@ 14 .
yes , doctor .
so , dr . russell , i hear you shot a 74 last week .
you should come to my club when you have a day off .
i used to play out there with your father .
we &apos;ll see if you measure up .
oh , i &apos;d love to , sir .
we get any path back yet ?
nothing &apos;s grown out of the cultures .
i checked them this morning , sir . i went to the lab myself .
so , dr. russell , is he still febrile ?
where is it ?
where &apos;s that damn crash cart ?
i was checking his wound when he went into s.v.t.
the respiratory distress . i can cardiovert him out of it .
charge the paddles to 100 .
charge paddles ? what the hell is going on here ?
he &apos;s here for a hernia surgery . what &apos;s happening ?
look , this is no job for a nurse .
i &apos;ll take it from here .
you know very well i am not a nurse .
back off .
clear .
dr. ellis grey-
2- time harper avery award winner .
and my colleague on this case-
a case that changed my life .
look around .
the biggest influences in your life
are sitting next to you right now .
this is gonna get more interesting .
yeah .
the late dr. ellis grey was known as a groundbreaker ,
a lion .
she was the best this hospital
or most hospitals had ever seen .
but back then , she was known as &quot; sugar &quot;
or &quot; nurse &quot;
or nothing at all .
this man came in for simple hernia repair
and he &apos;s getting sicker a instead of better .
you people better figure out why , and fast .
guess it &apos;s just you and me , kid .
surprise , surprise .
oh , crap .
oh , come on .
oh , come on . come on .
come on , come on , come on .
just talk .
just ... tell us what happened .
okay .
there was , uh , this patient .
he wanted to get his clubfoot fixed .
but i had a different idea .
you told him he could walk ?
yes . i was in the peace corps .
i &apos;ve seen polio . i &apos;ve studied the procedures .
you &apos;re privileged .
sir ?
your application . i remember it .
i &apos;m saying , you grew up privileged ,
and that privilege made you arrogant .
and arrogance in an unseasoned surgeon
is a very dangerous thing .
sir , i didn &apos;t make this promise lightly .
i can do this .
did you promise him you &apos;ll try
or did you promise him he &apos;ll walk ?
arrogant .
all right , dr. torres .
you &apos;ll live and die on this .
this is your career at seattle grace .
he &apos;s such an ass .
dr. gracie didn &apos;t like your infectious process idea ,
but i think that &apos;s what it &apos;s gotta be , right ?
gracie wouldn &apos;t know his ass from his finger .
is &quot; ass &quot; the word of the day ?
there was mild hemolysis on his c.b.c.
anemia ? rhabdo ?
was there any hematuria ?
no , but there was some yeast in his urine .
a contaminant .
maybe the hemolysis was just a bad blood draw .
every day ?
that doesn &apos;t seem right .
mm . this hemolysis thing is a red herring .
i feel it in my bones
that we &apos;re going dow the wrong road .
yeah , you &apos;re right . i feel it in my bones , too .
get your mind out of the gutter .
how can i do that when i &apos;m tearing your clothes off ?
oh . think of the possibilities for post @-@ op fever-
wind , wound , water .
water .
the yeast .
i think i got it .
single most important step ...
in the treatment process-
anyone ? physical exam .
no . no chocolate for you .
lab and radiology evaluation .
uh , oh , come on , people . now you &apos;re embarrassing me .
patient history .
thank you . catch .
there isn &apos;t much inflammation ,
but there are a lot of gallstones .
dr. baylow , what causes gallstones ?
high fat diets are a huge contributor .
yes , fatty foods and ?
uh , she &apos;s vegan .
who &apos;s talking ?
i &apos;m sorry , sir .
keep it down or get out of the o.r.
she &apos;s vegan .
she is ?
y- yeah . she , uh , has had severe reflux most of her life ,
until she discovered when she was 15
that a vegan diet helped .
her ex @-@ boyfriend ,
who broke up with her after her last surgery ,
was a vegan chef .
well , that &apos;s quite a history you have there , doctor .
dr. baylow ,
your intern &apos;s doing a hell of a job .
listen you little moppet .
you hang me out to dry like that in front of the chief again ,
and i will end you @-@ yo career ,
your future , your life .
do we understand each other ?
if it were up to me ,
you &apos;d be doing scut until your hair turns gray .
oh , wait a minute . it is up to me .
we &apos;re not allowed to beat you with sticks .
so we punish you with scut .
we do it today , and they did it back in my day .
dr. grey and i did mountains of scut .
testing tissue samples was boring .
but it &apos;s how we found out
our patient had a fungus called cryptococcus .
have you traveled recently to a tropical country ,
like taiwan or argentina ?
no . i &apos;ve never even en out of this country ?
do you live near a bird aviary
or are you around a lot of pigeons ?
no .
what kind of questions are these ?
we asked his girlfriend to step out ...
because we knew we were gonna have to ask
some pretty uncomfortable questions .
we suspected he might have g.r.i.d.
does anyone know what g.r.i.d. is ?
a.i.d.s.
that &apos;s right .
but in 1982 , it was known as ...
gay @-@ related immune deficiency ?
you think i have sex with men ?
are you out of your minds ?
what kind of doctors are you ?
sir , sir-
you &apos;re sick !
sir , just calm down .
we &apos;re not passing any judgment .
they &apos;re just standard questions .
get this thing out of my arm !
sir , get back into bed . you still need the antibiotics .
i &apos;ll get the antibiotics elsewhere ,
from real doctors .
i did not come here e insulted !
and don &apos;t think i won &apos;t talk to your superiors about this .
this was early 1982 .
we hadn &apos;t seen a case in washington state , ever .
san francisco only had five cases .
we didn &apos;t know what it was ,
and because it was isolated to the gay community ,
the government wasn &apos;t funding research .
does anyone know
when the h.i.v. retrovirus was finally discovered ?
uh , 1983 , but there wasn &apos;t a test for it until &apos; 85 .
that &apos;s right . it was so new
that even our attending didn &apos;t know how to handle it .
g.r.i.d. ?
you accused a patient in my hospital
of having a disease that hasn &apos;t even been proven to exist ?
what were you thinking ? that patient wasn &apos;t even a gay .
he &apos;s threatening to sue us for slander . good job .
you &apos;re on probation .
both of you .
patient &apos;s getting harder to ventilate .
did you hear me ?
i heard you . shush .
did you shush me ? don &apos;t shush me .
you need to start to wrap up . wrap up ? i just got started .
we &apos;ve been working for eight hours .
because i &apos;m trying to be meticulous ,
make sure i &apos;m getting a good compression .
i think it &apos;s gonna work . i &apos;m pretty sure .
pretty sure ?
he &apos;s got pericarditis and lung disease .
he &apos;s getting unstable .
dude , do you want him to walk
or do you want him to keep breathing ?
successes or failures ...
which teaches you more ?
failures .
yeah , but that was a gimmie . don &apos;t get too cocky .
the patient was discharged , and a month later ,
she was back in the e.r. in the middle of the night .
she had right lower quadrant pain , fever , vomiting-
symptoms consistent with ?
appendicitis .
aha . you get a chocolate , &apos; cause that &apos;s what i thought .
but don &apos;t eat it yet . pay attention .
i diagnosed alicia with appendicitis .
and dr. webber decided that tp
was going to be my first solo surgery .
mobilize the cecum .
here you go .
not bad , dr. bailey .
thank you , sir .
i &apos;m glad you decided to come to seattle grace .
you were a strong applicant .
people are excited to have you here .
surgery &apos;s a shark tank .
sharks have teeth .
make sure you &apos;re a shark , too ,
and not a minnow .
s- sir , are you referring to my height ?
no , i &apos;m not . god made you short .
who made you quiet ?
that , unfortunately , is a perfectly healthy appendix .
what ?
no infection , no inflammation .
the whole lower right quadrant looks good .
sir , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m s @-@ i &apos;m so sorry .
shake it off .
you know , if you never get a negative appy ,
that means you &apos;re not doing enough appys .
that &apos;s just part of the process .
all right , let &apos;s take it out , and we &apos;ll get ready to close .
i didn &apos;t want to close , but ...
we had to .
so ...
we took the ... patient
to surgery again , and ...
wait , no .
hang on .
you were there . help her .
that &apos;s when we saw the dude do the thing with his foot .
you know ...
the surgery was more difficult than i anticipated .
uh , i @-@ i was able to do the tendon release .
but your lungs and heart weren &apos;t able to withstand
any more time under anesthesia .
so i couldn &apos;t do any more than that .
i understand .
when do we start again ?
sunder , i &apos;m saying , i ...
i think we don &apos;t .
well ...
now i don &apos;t understand .
look at this .
look at my foot .
watch it .
you did that for me .
since i was 7 , i have never been able to do that .
i &apos;ve always been different .
i &apos;ve always been stared at .
i want to walk .
i want to stand straight up .
i believe you can do the rest .
please .
please try .
no surgeon likes giving up on a patient .
dr. grey and i liked it even less than most .
but when a patient refuses treatment ,
you &apos;re done .
i mean , we were done .
well , that &apos;s what we thought anyhow .
i put in the n.g. tube , doctor .
okay .
dr. grey , looking beautiful as usual .
flattery will get you to an on @-@ call room
in five minutes or less .
you &apos;re on .
mommy ! mommy ! look !
that &apos;s supposed to be for her birthday .
she was crying . she misses you .
and i got desperate .
richard .
thatcher , how are you ?
i only have a few seconds . show me your doll .
dr. grey , dr. webber , start to emergency .
i gotta go , thatch .
mommy , don &apos;t go !
take her .
thatcher , i have to go . meredith .
mommy , no .
mommy .
don &apos;t go .
dr. grey , dr. webber , start to the e .
kaposi &apos;s sarcoma .
your g.r.i.d. patient from a few months back .
handle it .
i &apos;m sorry i ...
you were right .
you were right about everything .
please ...
help me .
a healthy appendix-
the third surgery for this patient
with unrelenting abdominal pain , fatigue and muscle pain .
now what ?
test for zebras . um , uncommon diseases .
okay .
do an a.n.a. for lupus .
lupus . yeah .
whoa , what about lead ? you test for lead ?
good , good . see ?
sometimes i @-@ it &apos;s not easy .
sometimes you have to be your patieunt &apos;s advocate
and push to get things done .
excuse me , uh , dr. baylow .
alicia tatum is being discharged
with nothing but a note for a psych consult ?
she &apos;s sniffing around for pain meds .
she &apos;s depressed and it is her problem .
well , yeah . months of severe , untreated pain can be depressing .
okay , smarty pants .
i just thought maybe we could test for lupus
or , um , lead poisoning
or look , even hemochromatosis-
we are not ordering thousands of dollars in tests
for something that can be cured with a big dose of prozac .
but
what are we doing with alicia tatum ?
we &apos;re turfing her to psych for depression .
well , we cut her open three time and didn &apos;t cure her pain .
wouldn &apos;t you be depressed ?
of course .
before she goes , i thought we could test for lupus
or lead poisoning or maybe hemochromatosis .
hemochromatosis . now you &apos;re thinking .
good work .
oh , my god . i think that &apos;s an intussusception .
i &apos;ve never seen one before in an adult .
well , i suppose we &apos;d handle it the same way
as with a kid , right ?
dr. gracie , what would you do in this situation ?
quite frankly , nothing . i wouldn &apos;t operate .
this patient is a lost cause . he &apos;s got g.r.i.d.
it &apos;s called a.i.d.s. now .
a.i.d.s.
no one knows what &apos;s causing it or how it spreads .
you want me to potentially risk the health of my staff ,
my own life , for a guy with a death sentence ?
no , i &apos;m not doing it .
and i recommend you don &apos;t do it either .
we took an oath . we &apos;re supposed to be healers .
ten years ago ,
you wouldn &apos;t even have been allowed in this program .
don &apos;t you dare tell me what kind of oath we take .
we &apos;d hit a wall .
and , um ...
we planned a number of procedures .
but , um ...
uh , but then ...
then i gave you that rousing pep talk .
you know what ? you totally did .
what if i had quit in the elevator ?
what if i had frozen ? i mean , i had every reason to freeze .
i &apos;m an intern . i never had my hand on a heart before .
no reason for me to think
i &apos;m not gonna do anything but kill that cop faster .
but you didn &apos;t .
no , i didn &apos;t .
i- i cut him open , i cross @-@ clamped the aorta ,
i stuck my finger in the hole and i stopped the bleeding .
it was seamless . i was perfect .
so pretend there &apos;s a blackout
and you &apos;re stuck in an elevator and your guy is bleeding out .
what are you gonna do ? are you gonna just quit ?
what was the result ?
did she test positive for hemochromatosis ?
nope .
uh , what about lime disease ?
lime disease @-@ negative .
celiac disease @-@ negative .
every test i could think of @-@ negative .
so i did what i &apos;ve told you all to do when you get stuck .
i went to the library and i hit the books .
i hit &apos; em hard .
i was raised to be polite , you know ?
don &apos;t raise your voice ,
have respect for people higher in the pecking order ,
be generous to those below-
i was not raised to be a shark .
now does that make me a minnow ?
am i a minnow ?
i- i really don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m a minnow .
not because of my height .
because i &apos;m a minnow on the inside .
that is a sad state of affairs , joe .
hell , we weren &apos;t noble .
we were just more arrogant than the rest
and had more to prove .
your c.t. showed that your bowel has twisted in on itself ,
probably because of kaposi &apos;s lesions in your abdomen .
it &apos;s a pretty rare problem ,
but we can take care of it with surgery .
will dr. gracie be doing the surgery ?
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re stuck with us .
he &apos;s scared , isn &apos;t he ?
just like them , outside .
i can see them ...
pointing , mumbling , staring .
screw them .
i don &apos;t blame them ...
for being scared .
i &apos;m scared , too .
i used to be scared that , um ...
people would find out that i was gay and ...
now , um , i can &apos;t even hide it anymore .
i &apos;m a @-@ i &apos;m a leper ...
an outcast ...
an untouchable .
no one will look at me .
no one will touch me .
i want to hate everyone
for treating me this way .
but how ...
how can i hate them for being scared
when i &apos;m the one that &apos;s been living the lie ?
this is your chance to change that .
have this surgery ,
let us operate .
what &apos;s the point ?
no one recovers from this .
no one lives .
for all you know ,
there could be a cure for this thing tomorrow or next week .
let us operate .
we spent days trying to make things right ,
trying to figure out the best strategy .
so we , uh , we researched
and , uh , practiced and practiced ,
and ... eventually , we were ready .
okay , retract the rectus femoris . what about the nerve ?
b.p. just dropped and he &apos;s tachycardic .
torsades on the monitor .
oh , my god . pericardial tamponade ?
sounds like .
damn it .
okay , nobody panic . page cardio .
alex , we need to do a subxiphoid pericardiotomy
to drain the blood that &apos;s squeezing the heart .
it &apos;s like a miniature version
of what you did in the elevator . so get a scalpel .
what do you mean , you can &apos;t ? you already did .
take the scalpel .
i- i can &apos;t .
the patient is crashing , karev . do the elevator thing .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;ve never done this . it @-@ it w @-@ it wasn &apos;t me .
i &apos;m not the heart @-@ in @-@ the @-@ elevator guy . it was o &apos;malley .
okay . okay .
no , this is fine .
we &apos;re fine .
and you- you &apos;re doing this .
but i haven &apos;t
just because you haven &apos;t doesn &apos;t mean you can &apos;t .
get it together and take the scalpel .
okay .
make a 6 @-@ centimeter @-@ long incision
over the xiphisternal junction .
good .
we knew what we were doing was risky .
these days we know that a.i.d.s. transmission
requires exchanges of bodily fluids .
but back then we had no idea .
can you get it from casual contact , from the air ,
from surgery ?
no idea .
poor guy .
living a lie for so long .
yeah . shame .
we &apos;re living a lie , too .
what ?
we shouldn &apos;t be doing what we &apos;re doing . we have to stop .
no . we &apos;re not the lie
our marriages are the lie .
this ? us ?
this is what &apos;s right .
we should leave them , richard .
you leave adele , and i &apos;ll leave thatcher .
i can &apos;t . you have a daughter . i can &apos;t .
and neither can you .
you don &apos;t have to go in there . i can do this alone .
you have meredith to think about .
you &apos;re just like the rest of them .
you have a different skin color ,
but turns out , you &apos;re just like them .
ellis
i gave birth to a child , richard .
that makes me a mother . it doesn &apos;t make me inept .
it doesn &apos;t make me less of a woman .
it doesn &apos;t make me less of a surgeon .
no matter how much everyone wants it to .
all my research didn &apos;t help .
dr. baylow sent the patient home .
so i thought she &apos;d won .
i thought , you know ,
maybe i wasn &apos;t cut out for this game .
but a couple of months later ...
alicia ?
oh , thank god . a familiar face .
what happened ?
the pain got really bad .
they said maybe i have
some sort of obstruction or something
from the other surgeries .
they want to go back in and take another look .
mandy ...
i don &apos;t think i can take it anymore .
please tell me this surgery &apos;s gonna help .
they &apos;re gonna find something , right ?
d- don &apos;t touch her .
uh , i know you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re here to take her to the o.r. ,
but , uh , don &apos;t touch her .
so you canceled your resident &apos;s surgery ?
isn &apos;t that a little bold ?
well , she was worried out adhesions , right ?
give me candy .
no adhesions . no candy .
and it wasn &apos;t bold , grey , it was stupid .
but in this case , it was also necessary .
where do you get off canceling my surgery ?
when i paged you ...
you work for me . got that ?
you listen to what i have to say .
are you at all familiar with what surgeons do , dr. bailey ?
we cut .
yeah , rebook ms. tatum for surgery .
no , d @-@ dr. baylow , you wanted to go in
and explore her obstruction .
she doesn &apos;t have any signs of adhesions .
look , just because she &apos;s had previous surgeries
doesn &apos;t mean that you shouldn &apos;t actually look for another cause .
she has a pseudo @-@ obstruction
that could be resolved with an n.g. tube .
and if you &apos;d looked further
and i @-@ i don &apos;t know , talked to your patient ,
you would &apos;ve discovered that along with abdominal pain ,
she also had , uh , weakness , palpitations ,
numbness , uh , skin changes
and her urine is intermittently dark .
ringing any bells yet ?
your patient , who &apos;s been sliced nine ways to sunday ,
has porphyria .
if you had diagnosed it earlier ,
she could &apos;ve avoided getting her ovaries taken out
and her gallbladder and-
yes , yes , i took out her appendix ,
and i , too , am at fault for not looking at the whole person .
but you know the difference between you and me ?
i learned something from it .
i learned when not to cut .
i learned to listen to my patient .
how could you have not learned in three years
what took me three months to learn ?
dr. bailey .
and the reason i had her chart
was because you ignored my pages
and she needs to get started on hemin right away .
you put it in her i.v.
you give it to her daily for four days ...
dr. bailey .
the patient gets better .
the patient doesn &apos;t get prodded , probed , scoped
or cut open like a thanksgiving turkey .
you supercilious fool !
dr. bailey . my office .
now .
we did a series of shorter surgeries
so his lungs and heart could withstand the anesthesia .
it was grueling for the patient , but worth it in the end .
show &apos; em the x @-@ rays .
oh , yeah . so cool .
okay , um ...
these are the before .
and these are the after .
yeah , it was ... it was amazing .
i mean , after the final surgery ,
we were just ...
and , uh , we celebrated that night .
man , did we ever celebrate .
mm . wait .
cone of silence .
yeah , yeah , yeah . whatever .
i knew i was in big trouble .
now it is my job
to make sure that my residents are supported
and treated with respect .
of course , and i &apos;m so sorry-
you have said enough for one day .
sorry .
it &apos;s my job .
so we are gonna sit here with you wearing
that terrified look on your face
for a respectable amount of time
so that dr.baylow and her friends can assume
you are having your behind handed to you on a platter .
you &apos;re gonna make a hell of a surgeon ,
dr. bailey .
lose the smile .
well , the patient survived the surgery .
but eight months later ,
he came back with p.c.p. pneumonia .
he died a week later .
dr. grey and i ...
i won &apos;t speak for her .
but i lost the sense that i was a superhero .
and i really started to think of how dangerous it all was .
it changes you ... this work .
your patients , your colleagues ...
you change each other .
you don &apos;t ever think you &apos;ll lose your way .
but what happens in this hospital ...
just remember why you came here .
you said it the day you graduated from med school .
you took the physician &apos;s oath .
remember it .
tape it to your locker ,
to your bathroom mirror ...
&apos;cause it is too easy to lose your way .
i solemnly pledge
to consecrate my life to the service of humanity .
i will give to my teachers ...
the respect and gratitude that is their due .
i will practice my profession
with conscience and dignity .
the health of my patients
will be my number one consideration .
i will respect the secrets that are confided in me
even after my patient has died .
i will maintain by all the means in my power
the honor and the noble traditions of the medical profession .
my colleagues will be my sisters and brothers .
i will not permit considerations of age ,
disease or disability
creed
ethnic origin
gender
race
political affiliation
nationality
sexual orientation
social standing
or any other factor
to intervene between my duty
and my patient .
i will maintain the utmost respect for human life .
i will not use my medical knowledge
to violate human rights and civil liberties ,
even under threat .
i make these promises solemnly
freely
and upon my honor .
the job offer still stands . think about it .
let me know .
we &apos;ll see .
to philip .
may he rest in peace .
you can &apos;t toast a dead irishman
with a soda pop , richard .
get this man a vodka , frankie .
oh , yeah . coming right up .
you know i can &apos;t stand the taste of that stuff .
it &apos;s time to learn .
you &apos;re a grown @-@ up , richard .
it &apos;s time to act like it .
i can &apos;t leave her , ellis .
i can &apos;t .
