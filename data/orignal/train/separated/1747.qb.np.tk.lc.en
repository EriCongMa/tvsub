we were worried about you .
don &apos;t be melodramatic .
i &apos;m just getting on a train and leaving forever .
so a few things don &apos;t go your way
and your best decision
is to ride the rails like a hobo ?
leonard , i am overwhelmed .
everything is changing ,
and it &apos;s simply too much .
i need to get away and think .
sheldon ...
yes ?
i &apos;m gonna miss you .
of course you are .
you just made that easier .
excuse me .
is it at all possible
that you &apos;re knitting a pair of pants ?
oh , well , no , you &apos;re understandably terrified .
but , you know , allow me to explain .
45 days ago , um , i embarked on
a railroad journey of healing
because my university
was making me do string theory ,
and my favorite comic book store burned down ,
and when my roommate got engaged ,
my girlfriend wanted to move in with me ,
which was no doubt a ploy just to see my--
well , excuse my language , but my bathing suit parts .
uh , sir , may i use your phone ?
i don &apos;t think so .
yeah , well ,
i understand that i &apos;m half naked ,
but there is a reasonable explanation .
while i slept in my sleeper car ,
all my possessions were stolen .
now , typically , i wear pajamas ,
but i recently adopted a hobo lifestyle
and pajamas are the sleep @-@ pants of the man .
i &apos;ll have you know , mahatma gandhi wore no pants
and a nation rallied behind him !
my good man ...
now , before you walk away ...
i know that i may appear deranged ,
but i am , in fact , a world @-@ renowned physicist .
ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion .
go ahead , ask !
bosons have integer spin ,
fermions have half @-@ integer spin !
my legs are getting cold !
why won &apos;t anybody help me ?
morning .
hi . want to do yoga with me ?
um , let me just have some coffee first ,
and then i &apos;ll have the strength to tell you
how much i won &apos;t be doing that .
hello ?
hello , leonard .
hey , buddy . good to hear your voice .
uh , i &apos;m in kingman , arizona ,
and , uh , i need you to come pick me up .
i &apos;d love to .
i &apos;m just about to do yoga with penny .
leonard , i &apos;m at the police station .
i was robbed .
th @-@ they took my phone ,
my wallet , my ipad , everything .
oh , my god , are you okay ?
no , i &apos;m not okay .
i @-@ i &apos;m wearing borrowed pants ,
i @-@ i don &apos;t have i.d. ,
and one of the officers here
won &apos;t stop calling me chicken legs .
okay .
uh , i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll come get you .
what &apos;s the address ?
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
he got all of his stuff stolen .
okay ...
hurry .
sheldon , hang tight .
hey , do you want me to bring anything ?
oh , yes , please .
a pair of pants .
and my toothbrush .
yeah , and my mail .
and a really good comeback for chicken legs ,
because &quot; i know you are , but what am i ? &quot;
was met with stony silence .
i &apos;ll be there as soon as i can .
is he okay ?
yeah , he &apos;s fine , he &apos;s just a little rattled .
oh ... feel like driving to arizona with me ?
i can &apos;t , i have that job interview .
oh , right . besides ,
i don &apos;t need six hours of &quot; your hair is different .
why did you change your hair ?
i &apos;m holding my breath until your hair grows back . &quot;
all right , fine .
hey , can you think of a reason
i shouldn &apos;t invite amy to come with me ?
nope .
come on , you didn &apos;t even try .
thanks for the lift .
what &apos;s wrong with your car ?
i &apos;m having my windows untinted .
why ?
got a hot girlfriend now .
i want the haters to know .
what are you talking about ?
no one &apos;s paying attention to you .
how &apos;s that hater @-@ ade taste , bro ?
hey , this isn &apos;t the way to work .
i just want to pop in and make sure ma &apos;s okay .
i thought stuart was looking after her .
he was , but now that her cast is off , he moved out .
and honestly , i &apos;m kind of glad .
it was getting a little weird .
how so ?
i don &apos;t know , they &apos;re ...
chummy .
like us ?
no , not like us .
creepy chummy ,
like you and your dog .
she feeds him out of her own mouth ?
i mean , he calls her debbie ,
she calls him stewie
and they &apos;re all giggly around each other .
and believe me , when food goes in that mouth ,
it does not come out .
so are you worried
because he &apos;s replacing you as a son
or are you worried because he &apos;s becoming her lover ?
first of all , no one can replace me as a son .
i &apos;m her little matzo ball .
and secondly , my mother is well past
having any kind of sex life .
okay , okay .
although many older women lead vibrant , active ...
i said well past it !
excuse me , officer hernandez ?
any leads on the person who stole my belongings ?
not yet .
well , perhaps i can help .
sherlock holmes always says
when you eliminate the impossible ,
whatever remains , however improbable ,
must be the truth .
now , have @-@ have you tried doing that ?
nope .
well , maybe you should .
th @-@ th @-@ there &apos;s lots of books called &quot; sherlock holmes &quot;
and there &apos;s no books called &quot; officer hernandez . &quot;
thanks again for coming .
six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself .
my pleasure .
and i &apos;m not angry at all
that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me .
i love that !
yeah , time &apos;s gonna fly by .
i haven &apos;t been on a job interview in years .
i &apos;m really nervous .
don &apos;t be .
you are built for pharmaceutical sales .
you &apos;re cute , you &apos;re flirty and ...
started that like there were gonna be three things .
i don &apos;t have any experience in sales .
unless you count the bikini car wash i did in high school .
but you already made me take that off my resume ?
this job is a lot like being a waitress ,
except instead of pushing the fish tacos
&apos;cause they &apos;re about to go bad ,
you &apos;re just pushing our antidepressants
before the fda finds out they may cause rectal bleeding .
they do ?
maybe .
but like our lawyers say , the world is full of things
that can cause a rectum to bleed .
anyway , i talked you up to dan .
he &apos;s the guy who &apos;ll be interviewing you .
oh , i really appreciate this .
i just hope i &apos;m not in over my head .
you &apos;ll be fine . just be yourself .
i wish i felt more confident .
penny ,
i wouldn &apos;t have put you up for this job
if i didn &apos;t think you could handle it .
oh , thank you , but maybe i should cancel .
it &apos;s too late to cancel . you &apos;re going .
but i don &apos;t know anything about pharmaceuticals .
oh , i understand .
you want to do something you &apos;re already good at .
i know .
why don &apos;t i get you a job at
the sitting around all day wearing yoga pants factory ?
they &apos;re comfortable .
ma , i hope you &apos;re decent . raj is here !
you just started seeing naked women again ,
and i don &apos;t want you to be confused
about where the boobs should be .
oh , hey , guys .
what are you doing here ?
uh ... w @-@ what are you doing here ?
i thought you moved out .
oh , yeah , i was going to ,
and then debbie and i got to talking
over dinner the other night .
i didn &apos;t have anyplace to go ,
she likes having me around ,
so we both said , &quot; why leave ? &quot; at the same time .
it was precious .
it &apos;s not that precious .
i &apos;d like to back you up ,
but it sounds like it was pretty precious .
stewie , i can &apos;t find my glasses !
be right there , deb deb !
they &apos;re probably on her head .
or in her neck . listen .
you staying here seems like something
she would &apos;ve talked to me about .
well , maybe if you called your mother more often , you &apos;d know .
it wouldn &apos;t kill you to pick up the phone .
any word on my stolen items ?
we &apos;re doing everything we can .
you know , sherlock holmes
liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus .
but i &apos;m sure those cool ranch doritos are doing the trick .
sheldon .
leonard !
oh , i &apos;m so happy to see you .
are you okay ?
oh , i &apos;m fine .
why did you come ?
what do you mean , why did i come ?
you &apos;re my boyfriend .
i haven &apos;t seen you in over a month .
i just drove six hours to help you out .
don &apos;t you have anything to say besides ,
&quot; why did you come ? &quot;
i do , but ...
i feel uncomfortable saying it out loud
in front of these police officers .
fine .
whisper it .
shotgun .
so , sheldon , tell us about your trip .
where &apos;d you go ?
where didn &apos;t i go ?
i went to new york , chicago ,
atlanta , denver , seattle .
how were they ?
oh , i have no idea .
i never left the train station .
hang on . you traveled across the entire country
and never left a train station ?
why would i ?
that &apos;s where all the cool trains are .
i &apos;m sorry , so you never went outside ?
or had a single piece of fruit .
so ...
why do you think you &apos;d make
a good pharmaceutical sales rep ?
well , i &apos;m a people person .
people like me .
some of my favorite people are people .
i feel like i &apos;m saying &quot; people &quot; a lot .
people , people , people , pe ... okay , i &apos;m done .
you sure ?
people . yes .
good !
so , how do you feel your previous job experience
has prepared you for a career like this ?
uh , well , as a waitress , sales was a big part of my job .
i mean , believe me , i convinced a lot of very large customers ,
who should not be eating cheesecake ,
to have more cheesecake .
i mean ,
one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump !
i have an insulin pump .
people .
it &apos;s weird , right ?
a grown man in his 30s living with my mother .
that is weird .
i thought he was , like , 45 .
come on , you don &apos;t think it &apos;s a little odd ?
i don &apos;t know ! i mean , she &apos;s lonely .
he needs a place to stay .
i doubt there &apos;s any funny business going on .
and even if there was , who cares ?
they &apos;re both adults .
&quot; who cares &quot; ? ! you wouldn &apos;t care
if i slept with your mom ?
you know what ? you &apos;re my best friend ,
and she &apos;s in a bad marriage .
i give you my blessing .
this is stupid .
i &apos;m just gonna call my mother and be honest with her .
&apos;cause that &apos;s what little matzo balls do .
this is debbie !
and this is stuart !
just kidding !
leave a message !
this is the part where you talk .
all right , let &apos;s say a physician was prescribing
one of our competitor &apos;s drugs .
how would you convince them to switch to ours ?
any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a bikini ?
no ...
okay , i &apos;m really sorry for wasting your time .
don &apos;t worry about it . thanks for stopping by .
okay , thanks .
um , i &apos;m sor ... listen , could you do me a favor
and not tell bernadette how badly i blew this interview ?
she &apos;ll get upset .
and honestly i &apos;m a ... a little terrified of her .
wait , wait . you &apos;re scared of bernadette ?
yeah , kind of .
i thought it was just me !
e @-@ everyone thinks she &apos;s so nice
with that squeaky little voice .
i know , but she &apos;s kind of a bully !
she is !
i @-@ i didn &apos;t even want to meet you ,
but , uh , i was too scared to say no to her .
me , too !
yeah , yeah ! one @-@ one time , i had ...
oh ! i had to tell her
we were cutting the @-@ the research funding
for one of the drugs she was developing .
what happened ?
i couldn &apos;t do it !
she &apos;s still working on it !
we &apos;re not gonna tell her about this , right ?
oh , my god , no !
no , no ...
at the hot dog stand in the denver train station--
heinz ketchup .
at the hot dog stand in the salt lake city train station--
heinz ketchup .
at the hot dog stand in the indianapolis train station ...
i don &apos;t care .
wrong ! hunt &apos;s !
hey , amy ! what do you say ?
you ready to move on to the mustard round ?
have you not noticed that i &apos;ve been sitting back here
quietly stewing for the past two hours ?
i just thought you were bad at the game .
i &apos;m mad at you !
how could you just go away like that
without even saying good @-@ bye ,
and then call leonard for help instead of me ?
amy ?
may i please have a moment of privacy
to speak with my roommate ?
we &apos;re in a moving car !
what do you expect me to do ?
stick my fingers in my ears ?
well , i was thinking put your head out the window like a dog ,
but that &apos;ll work .
please ? this &apos;ll be quick .
leonard ?
as soon as we get home ,
i want to have coitus with amy .
okay , she can &apos;t hear .
the reason i called you
is because i didn &apos;t want amy
to know i couldn &apos;t make it on my own .
what &apos;s the big deal ?
oh , of course it &apos;s no big deal to you .
you idolize me , and nothing could ever knock me
off that pedestal you put me on .
well , yeah , it &apos;s true .
you @-@ you are a god to me .
can i stop now ?
just tell her .
i called leonard because ...
i failed .
and i didn &apos;t want you to think less of me .
you were worried about that ?
yes .
sheldon ...
it &apos;s okay with me that you &apos;re not perfect .
can i have one more moment with leonard ?
sure .
amy just hurt my feelings . i want to break up with her .
now , i never thought i &apos;d say this ,
but i &apos;m kind of excited to see sheldon .
i never thought i &apos;d say this , but penny got a job today .
she did ?
well , the only reason she got it
is &apos; cause the guy who interviewed her loves me .
what do you want ?
i , uh , kind of got the feeling
you might not be okay with me staying at your mom &apos;s .
you &apos;re right , i &apos;m not .
i think it &apos;s weird .
howie ?
it is . he &apos;s a grown man .
he &apos;s just gonna live there rent @-@ free ?
how is that gonna motivate him
to get off his butt and get a job ?
i mean , do you even have a plan ?
hey , you &apos;re not my father , okay ?
and besides , your mother and i were talking ...
&quot; your mother and i &quot; ? you &apos;re not my father !
i didn &apos;t say i was your father !
well , i didn &apos;t say
i was your father !
okay , calm down .
you &apos;re not his father , he &apos;s not your father !
nobody &apos;s anybody &apos;s father .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry you don &apos;t like my life choices ,
but it &apos;s my life !
well , it &apos;s my house , it &apos;s my rules !
okay , dad !
if i mow the lawn , can i have my allowance ?
hey , don &apos;t you take that sarcastic tone with him !
i don &apos;t have to listen to you !
don &apos;t talk to her like that !
that is my mother ... wife !
my wife ! i said my wife !
you know what ?
this isn &apos;t getting us anywhere .
when you &apos;re ready to apologize , you know where to find me .
well , yeah , in my house !
that &apos;s right , sucka !
i wish i &apos;d never gone on that trip .
i feel no better now than when i left .
but you still accomplished something .
yeah . if you had told anyone
that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country ,
do you know what they would have said ?
that i couldn &apos;t do it ?
exactly .
right after they said , &quot; yay ! &quot;
but you did do it .
so what if it didn &apos;t all go your way ?
that &apos;s what makes it an adventure .
that &apos;s a good point .
yeah , i &apos;m a lot like gandalf the grey .
he fought the balrog and emerged
stronger than ever as gandalf the white .
i was robbed of my phone and pants ,
and i , too , came back stronger .
and whiter , too ,
&apos;cause i wasn &apos;t in direct sunlight for six weeks .
see ? this trip was good for you .
indeed .
i was the world &apos;s smartest caterpillar .
and then after pupating in our nation &apos;s railway system ,
i &apos;ve burst forth
as the world &apos;s smartest butterfly .
butterfly could &apos;ve gotten himself home from arizona .
yeah , i feel renewed .
i &apos;m ready to deal with any changes that come my way .
look who &apos;s back !
your hair is different . you changed your hair .
i can &apos;t take this . i &apos;m out .
would you like to see pictures from my trip ?
i thought your phone got stolen .
yeah , it did , but luckily all my photos
got backed up to the cloud .
and you thought they all had a silver lining .
here-- day one .
uh , this was the seat i was going to sit
in but didn &apos;t
because there were cracker crumbs on it .
as it was first class , i suspect ritz .
this is the train bathroom .
this is the imodium i took
so i would never have to use the train bathroom .
i cannot believe you traveled the entire country
and never left the train station .
i know .
you know , i almost died in a fire in des moines ,
but i stayed put .
fyi--
that &apos;s when the imodium gave out .
