we found out hunter got into reed .
sayonara !
can &apos;t you be happy for hunter ?
it &apos;s her first choice .
she &apos;d die if she didn &apos;t get in .
why do you think everything has to do with me ?
because you didn &apos;t get in .
anthony ! nobody is hearing anything for months .
hunter took early acceptance to find out early .
that meant she could only apply to one college .
your sister has a lot of options .
such as : bowdoin , holy cross , georgetown ...
georgetown is a reach for me .
they &apos;d be crazy not to want you .
if i can get in , i can get into berkeley .
over my dead body .
there are more nobel prize winners
in the san francisco area than anywhere .
nobel prize for what ? packing fudge ?
you know that you can go anywhere you want to go to college .
but i &apos;m not gonna pay for berkeley .
i want to go to harvard or west point .
you may get to see them on tv , but that &apos;s about it .
to go there you gotta crack the books .

big pussy bompensiero , he started out as a cat burglar .
one time he left a load so big , cop thought a bear did it .
bompensiero started off chipping safes like this ?
until he stepped up for soprano during the unrest of &apos; 83 .
back then when you did something , you got recognized .
when your time comes ,
you either step up or you look for a new career .
selling stockings door @-@ to @-@ door .
the profile toner is a wonderful , affordable ...
... easily used alternative to undergoing facelift surgery .
the profile toner is great for any age and body type ...

absolutely . that &apos;s her job .
yeah , go ahead , laugh .
what if she gets into berkeley
and not into georgetown ?
she &apos;s in the national honor society .
don &apos;t be naive , tony . please .
how do you think hunter got into reed ?
her uncle , that &apos;s how . him and his wife are graduates .
that &apos;s the only way that freak &apos;s gonna get in .

they &apos;re in the building trades .

then i realized it was your sister .
now , didn &apos;t she go to georgetown ?
georgetown law . georgetown law review .

because my meadow applied to georgetown .
i hope and pray to jesus that she gets in .
she keeps talking about berkeley . madonna , berkeley !

jeannie , i need to ask you a favor .
i wonder if you &apos;d ask your sister ...
... to write meadow a recommendation . is that too much ?
but she doesn &apos;t really know meadow .
but you do .
you could give her the transcripts , which are excellent .
her paper on the melting ice cap made me cry ,
it &apos;s so poignant .
it was published in the caduceus .
my sister &apos;s so busy . that &apos;s all .
if there &apos;s any way you could find your way to helping me out .
i &apos;ll ask her .
thank you , jeannie .
i &apos;ll let you get back to your plants .
that &apos;s it . push up .
now , bracing yourself on the bedside hand ...
richie .
could you excuse us for a moment ?
no .
are you all right , mr. gaeta ?
he &apos;s fine . he &apos;s so proud ,
he won &apos;t accept some friendly concern .
just stay right out in the hall .
what do you want ?
why don &apos;t you kill me , you cocksucker ?
christ , look what you did to me .
whose idea was the ramp ?
what ramp ?
the fucking ramp .
if you need help ,
i &apos;ll fucking help you , you understand ?

it &apos;s not that . it &apos;s about manners .
what will i say ?
i &apos;m writing a letter for someone else , which i am .
a wonderful dominican boy from the projects ,
with a 5.2 average .
i have a reputation to protect .
i knew you wouldn &apos;t do it .
you want to be a doormat forever ?
just deal with it , jeannie , okay ?
it &apos;s no trouble at all to add two more .

listen , carmela . i spoke to my sister about the letter .
and she &apos;s sorry , but she just can &apos;t do it . i &apos;m sorry .
she can &apos;t ? why not ?
because she already wrote a letter for someone else .
a wonderful dominican man from the housing projects ...
... with a 5.2 average and ...
... crack @-@ addict mother , and cerebral palsy .
what does that mean ? she can &apos;t send two ?
did you think to ask one of the priests at church ?
a letter from father intintola would mean more , i bet .
especially at georgetown .
i gotta go . bye . good luck !
who was that ?
can &apos;t send two what ?
it &apos;s nothing .
joan , i don &apos;t want to interrupt you ...

meadow .
oh , sorry .
but i just can &apos;t do it .
i thought you would at least want to look at her grades and sat scores ...
... and teacher comments before you decide .
she &apos;d be a wonderful addition to georgetown .
then the admissions officers will see that .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s true .
the sad fact is , that &apos;s not enough these days .
i &apos;m sorry , carmela . but i can &apos;t do it .
i don &apos;t think you understand .
i want you to write that letter .
excuse me ?
i want you to write the letter .
are you threatening me ?
threat ? what threatening ?
i brought a pie , and a transcript so you could write ...
... a letter for my daughter to georgetown .
i &apos;m an officer of the court .
a lawyer .
don &apos;t make me beg here .
i &apos;ve written my last letter of support for this academic year .
how about this ? you could write a letter to georgetown ...
... about discovering it wasn &apos;t that person &apos;s first choice ...
... and that he was using georgetown as a backup .
i &apos;m not telling you what to write .
oh , i left my mother in the car with that foot .

wet ! it was starting to smell .
it &apos;s my room , and that &apos;s the way i want it !
i don &apos;t bitch about your room !
your room is in my house .

what &apos;s going on ?
nothing i can think of .
except it &apos;s tuesday , 3 : 00 .
so we gotta talk about something .
okay , spin the wheel .
here &apos;s something that &apos;s been bothering me .
i gave my daughter a car .
really ?
yeah , a used car . one of those suvs .
you know , a &apos; 92 pathfinder .
it belonged to a friend of hers from school .
it came into my possession because of a debt by the kid &apos;s father .
this is the way he made payment .
you gave her her friend &apos;s car ?
it was a nice , safe car to which i had the pink slip .
what &apos;s bothering you ?
i must &apos;ve known she &apos;d know that it was this kid &apos;s car ...
... and how i got it . you know , and she &apos;d freak out .
then why &apos;d you give it to her ?
i don &apos;t know .
for all these years i been shielding and protecting her ...
... from certain truths .
so now i want to rub her nose in it ?
any thoughts on that ?
well , this kid &apos;s father , he &apos;s a fucking degenerate gambler .
but also a respected businessman in the community and so on .
one of your &quot; happy wanderers . &quot;
how do you remember this ?
so it becomes my fault he lost his kid &apos;s car ?
i gotta look out for this bastard ?
my friend artie &apos;s got a restaurant .
now , no one &apos;s telling him to refuse a plate of fettuccine ...
... to some fat fuck wandering in eating himself to death .
maybe that &apos;s what you said to her .
what ?
by giving her the suv .
wanting her to confront ambiguities .
english .
meadow &apos;s going to be going away to college next year .
that &apos;s why she needs the car .
leaving the nest .
not those fucking ducks again .
maybe you were ...
... preparing her for reality , to fly .
you people are something .
i give my little daughter a car to rub her face in shit ...
... and you tell me i did something noble ?
we &apos;re getting to something here .
times up .
look , we &apos;re doing good work .
what ? you feel you &apos;re cured ?
fine , i &apos;ll sit here . but i got nothing else to say .
yeah . did you call me ? oh , get the fuck out of here .
i &apos;m supposed to go all the way there to check a ramp ?
christopher , what &apos;s up ?
hey , what &apos;s up , man ?
get that motherfucker !
get him !
fucking seat belt !
richie .
yeah , what ?
matt drinkwater , bevilaqua .
hear what happened to christopher ?
yeah , somebody blew him up .
it was us . me and sean .
it was what ? you ?
sean &apos;s dead . christopher killed him .
so , what are you doing here ?
we did it for you . a favor .
what are you saying ?
you don &apos;t like him .
so what ?
he hit your niece .
jesus , are you crazy ?
that &apos;s all i need now for that fuck ...
... to think i had a part of this .
you gotta help me , man .
i &apos;ll help you . i &apos;ll fucking help you !
hide me , i &apos;m with you now .
who told you to do that ?
