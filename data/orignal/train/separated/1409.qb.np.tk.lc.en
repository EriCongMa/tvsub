can people change ?
well , that &apos;s a- that is a tough one ,
but i would say yes . people can change .
that &apos;s what i believe anyway , and i will till the day i die .
you do realize you &apos;re proving the exact opposite of your point ?
see ? she &apos;s changed . she used to be very supportive of me .
come on .
phil !
ow ! ow ! why is it so loud ?
my ears are bleeding !
why is it so loud ?
i don &apos;t know ! make it stop !
i just installed a sweet home theater system in the family room .
the , um- the trouble is claire struggles ...
with technology of any kind .
i mean , remotes , cell phones , computers .
haley , have you seen my blue-
hey , mrs. dunphy .
oh , hey , dylan .
you know i can see you , right ?
no , i did not know that .
haley &apos;s just in the bathroom . she &apos;ll be back in just a minute .
thank you .
where were you pointing it ?
at the tv .
this-
honey- uh , no . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s a home theater .
what , so i can &apos;t point it at the tv
when i want to watch the tv ?
no . you point it at the receiver .
what &apos;s a receiver ?
okay , imagine our home theater system is a human body .
so then the receiver is the brain .
the tv is the face .
i know what part you are .
so he says to his wife , &quot; you don &apos;t love me anymore ? &quot;
his heart- boom !
quadruple bypass . blown a valve .
hey ! look who it is .
hey . there he is .
what a coinkydink .
i was just getting some flowers for gloria
for babysitting lily .
you want me to take &apos; em to her ?
i would , but i have the most hilarious card for her at home .
it &apos;s- it &apos;s a hunky antonio banderas type
in silk boxers .
and on the inside , it says , &quot; thank you for last noche ,
but i can &apos;t find my pantalones . &quot;
i &apos;m not doing it justice , really .
hi . i &apos;m cameron .
oh , geez . i &apos;m sorry . guys , this is cameron .
he &apos;s a ... friend of my son &apos;s .
hey .
this is , uh , scotty , dale , hugo and shorty .
it &apos;s nice to meet you guys .
you guys look like a scene out of jersey boys .
ay ! so handsome !
thank you .
manny , are you wearing aftershave ?
yes , for my date .
this will be the first time she will ever smell me .
her name is whitney .
i met her in an online book club .
we both like vampire fiction ...
and the romance of eternal life .
i think it &apos;s adorable that manny has a date .
he even picked out the lunch menu-
grilled @-@ cheese sandwich and tomato soup .
tomato soup because , you know , the tomato soup is like the blood .
and the vampires like to eat the blood .
and then he wants me to take them out for ice cream ,
well , because manny likes ice cream .
oh , that must be her . if this goes well ,
you don &apos;t need to stick around .
hi . i &apos;m whitney . i &apos;m here for manny .
第一季 第十三集
see how that works ?
sorry , sweetie . sorry , daddy .
no , it &apos;s all right .
we were just- me and lily were just using the time ...
to figure out how to use the car &apos;s voice @-@ command thingy .
oh . here . check it out . watch .
cd player . next track .
say a command .
no .
cd player . next track .
air conditioner on .
damn it .
you &apos;re worse than your sister with this kind of stuff .
it &apos;s a good thing lily doesn &apos;t have an ejector seat .
oh , guess what . i ran into your dad and some of his friends .
oh , really ?
yeah . and get this .
he , uh- he referred to me as &quot; a friend of my son . &quot;
seriously ?
yeah .
that &apos;s a little disrespectful to you .
i wasn &apos;t offended by it .
well- i am .
i mean , would he refer to phil as &quot; a friend of claire &apos;s &quot; ? no .
i &apos;ve heard him call phil a lot worse .
just let it pass . i should have never said anything .
i &apos;m not letting it pass . he needs to know that &apos;s not okay .
and if he doesn &apos;t like it , he knows where he can go .
enter destination .
hell !
mexican food .
shut up !
i came out of the closet in my mid @-@ 20s .
i had to actually come out to my dad three times ...
before he finally acknowledged it .
i &apos;m not sure if maybe he was hoping he heard it wrong ,
like i had said , &quot; dad , i &apos;m gray . &quot;
and my parents , they always just knew .
my mother says labor with me took 36 hours ...
because i came out of the womb like this- &quot; hello ! &quot;
i gotta lay off these cannolis .
hey , dad .
mitchell . hey , you guys know my son , mitch .
hey , mitch , how they hangin &apos; ?
hey , mitch .
hey , hey , hey . that &apos;s a great coat .
where &apos;d you get that ?
i don &apos;t know . it was a gift .
really ? what is it- suede , microsuede ?
some kind of lambskin ? it &apos;s very soft , you know .
thank you .
uh , can i talk to you for a second ?
yeah . yeah , yeah , yeah .
thanks . good seeing you .
be right back .
what &apos;s the matter ?
um , &quot; a friend of my son &quot; ? that &apos;s how you introduce cam ?
that &apos;s why you came here ?
dad , it &apos;s just more than a little insulting .
cam and i have been together for five years .
we- we have a daughter .
look at these guys .
they look like they came out of the 1800s .
you see hugo over there ?
after lunch , he ordered a sanka .
no , they &apos;re not the ones that are uncomfortable with this . you are .
you &apos;ve never been completely accepting of me .
and now that i have a family , it &apos;s getting a little old .
these guys don &apos;t understand the gay thing .
why create an awkward situation ? that &apos;s all i &apos;m saying .
that &apos;s weird ,
because your friend shorty there- gay as they come .
you gotta be kiddin &apos; .
no .
my gaydar is never wrong ,
and it is pinging like we &apos;re at a bathhouse .
what are you talking about- gay ? the guy used to be married .
okay , that makes- so did elton john ,
merv griffin , cole porter .
you know what ? listen . you couldn &apos;t be more wrong about this .
no , dad . you could not be more wrong- about a lot of things .
good seeing you guys .
you take care , man .
that &apos;s a great coat .
yeah , later .
ping !
phil dunphy .
hey , it &apos;s me .
hey .
listen , i &apos;ve got a bunch of moms over here ...
who wanna watch the talent show dvd ,
and i can &apos;t get the sound to work .
is there a picture ?
yes .
be honest . did you do that thing where you get frustrated ...
and you start pressing all the buttons ?
no .
i have a theory that phil installs ...
overly complicated things in the house ...
just so he has an excuse to talk to me like a child .
last month , it was the thermostat .
the snowflake button makes it cold , cold , cold
&quot; set temperature &quot; makes it hold , hold , hold
the little flame makes it hot
this is so humiliating .
i am sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
he just seemed so mature online .
how could i be so stupid ?
you &apos;re not stupid .
&quot; stupid &quot; is not following your heart and taking a chance on love .
i mean , what kind of 11 @-@ year @-@ old talks like that ?
manny &apos;s an old soul .
here . use my handkerchief .
you see what i mean ?
i &apos;ll just be alone for the rest of my life .
and that &apos;s okay .
no , don &apos;t say that .
in my country , there &apos;s a saying that means ...
&quot; love is just around the corner . &quot;
i come from a neighborhood with a lot of prostitutes .
maybe for you .
i mean , men must throw themselves at you every day .
they &apos;ii do the same for you if you just-
just what ? put out ?
no . just-
like , the lipstick , the hair , push @-@ up bra . you know .
what &apos;s it matter ? i &apos;m never gonna be as pretty as you .
ay , believe me , this takes a lot of work .
you just need to find your inner beauty .
it &apos;s hiding beneath a mask of insecurity .
okay , he &apos;s starting to freak me out .
manny , go play .
mitchell , how do these look to you ?
like they &apos;re dying .
i know . right ?
i said something to the florist . he said ,
&quot; don &apos;t worry about it . they &apos;re gonna come back . &quot;
they &apos;re not coming back . they &apos;ve crossed to the other side .
you are a funny man .
why ?
you &apos;re completely bothered by the flowers .
but when my father introduces you as &quot; a friend of my son , &quot;
doesn &apos;t faze you in the least .
because the florist played me for a fool .
your dad didn &apos;t mean any harm . he &apos;s just being who he is .
when i was back east in law school ,
my dad used to call me every saturday at 6 : 00 p.m. ,
before people would go out ,
just to , you know , check in , catch up .
and then , i think , the christmas of my second year ,
i finally got up the courage to tell him .
after that , i @-@ i ... pretty much just talked to my mom .
don &apos;t cry .
i &apos;m not crying .
i &apos;m home !
we &apos;re here .
this is whitney . we &apos;re giving her a makeover .
hi . you have such a nice family ...
and a really beautiful house .
thanks . you two know each other how ?
she &apos;s my date .
of course she is . i &apos;ll be in here .
i &apos;ll be right back .
i &apos;m sorry this didn &apos;t turn out like you wanted .
that &apos;s okay .
probably didn &apos;t turn out how you wanted it either .
i &apos;ll tell you what .
if neither of us is with anybody in 10 years ,
how about you and me give it a shot ?
that &apos;s disturbing .
but maybe .
how was your lunch with the boys ?
good .
ran into mitchell and cam .
ay , nice .
you &apos;re not gonna believe this .
mitchell says shorty &apos;s gay .
shorty ?
yeah , i believe it .
oh , come on !
well , he &apos;s a great dresser , a great dancer .
that doesn &apos;t prove anything .
he &apos;s the only one of your friends that never hits on me .
my friends hit on you ?
yes , all the time , but don &apos;t worry .
they &apos;re a bunch of harmless old men .
they &apos;re my age .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s very hard on shorty to keep a secret like that .
jay , i think you should talk to him .
what ?
you &apos;re the only one with a gay son .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll appreciate opening up to you .
we &apos;re guys . we don &apos;t open up .
we talk about sports and cars ,
getting up in the middle of the night to pee .
i &apos;m sure you made it very easy for mitch to come out of the closet .
yeah .
okay . i &apos;m gonna finish my makeover .
because i care about people .
because i want to help them change their lives .
jay , i &apos;m hinting that you should call your friend , okay ?
yes . i &apos;m getting that .
okay , okay .
hey , hey ! daddy in the hizzouse !
why would you do that to a brand @-@ new , very expensive remote ?
because i lost my temper , and it didn &apos;t work .
therefore , it &apos;s useless .
well , honey , when it comes to anything electronic ,
you &apos;re not exactly the best student .
i am very smart .
i had a 4.0 in college . how about you ?
i was almost that despite my substantial time
commitment to cheerleading .
i thought we agreed not to bring up the cheerleading .
cheerleading in my college was cool .
the football players were so jealous ,
they wouldn &apos;t even let me and my buddies
trevor , scotty and ling- go to their parties .
seriously , claire ,
you owe me an apology for breaking that .
okay . phil ,
i apologize for breaking the world &apos;s worst remote ...
that you bought ... stupidly .
excuse me ,
but the experts at cnet.com rated it the best remote .
they gave it three and a half mice .
wow . i have an idea . let &apos;s invite the gang from cnet over ...
and your old buddies from cheerleading ,
and we can have a nerd party .
ling is not a nerd .
he built his own helicopter .
and if he was alive today-
sweet pea , let &apos;s not talk about ling .
it upsets you too much .
you know what i &apos;m gonna do ?
hmm ?
i &apos;m gonna buy a new remote- the same remote .
and just to prove how wrong you are ,
i &apos;m gonna teach our dumbest kid
how to use it in 20 minutes or less .
who &apos;s our dumbest kid ?
luke .
luke ? no , luke understands electronics .
haley .
no .
yeah , haley .
teach haley to use the remote , and then i &apos;ll apologize .
haley ?
mm @-@ hmm .
come on !
hey , shorty , it &apos;s me .
i was thinking of heading over to the driving range
and hitting a few balls .
you want to join me ?
that &apos;s great , jay . what should i wear ?
i don &apos;t know . wear- wear whatever you want .
oh , my god ! oh , god !
what ?
the flowers .
they look so much better ! this is a disaster .
you do know what &quot; disaster &quot; means , right ?
you don &apos;t understand . i demanded that they come exchange them .
i got all medieval on the florist .
cam , i heard you on the phone .
you said you were displeased , but that &apos;s hardly going medieval .
excuse me . i said &quot; very displeased . &quot;
and i used my cowboy voice , so-
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m microwaving them so they look bad again .
well , that seems a little crazy , doesn &apos;t it ?
oh , no ! that &apos;s the florist .
relax . just take them out . i &apos;ll get the door .
he &apos;ll never know the difference .
hi . florist .
yes . come on in . he &apos;s over there with the flowers .
hello .
i don &apos;t know what happened .
they just , uh , somehow lost their vigor .
they were like this when we came home .
cam . cam .
oh , my god ! oh , my god !
oh , my god ! oh ! oh ! oh , my god !
god , god !
look at that . two things flaming at once .
damn it !
you know what the problem is .
what ?
you &apos;re not moving your hips . they &apos;re frozen .
hips ?
yeah , your hips . they &apos;re frozen . here , let me show you .
no , it &apos;s okay . - no , no . - don &apos;t fight me .
all right , shorty .
just bring the club back . go ahead . all right ?
now turn those hips . that &apos;s it . you just gotta relax .
you gotta open up the stance a little bit .
spread &apos; em . spread &apos; em .
that &apos;s it . if you don &apos;t relax ,
you &apos;re never gonna get that shaft where it belongs .
hey , you know what ? how about a coffee ?
let &apos;s get a coffee .
sure .
now press the button labeled &quot; activities . &quot;
where is that ? - it &apos;s just to the right . - to the right .
and now choose &quot; watch dvd . &quot;
what ?
honey , you gotta focus . we &apos;ve only got 20 minutes .
pretend- pretend the mall &apos;s closing .
dad , this is stupid .
i watch tv on my computer .
why do i have to learn this ?
because your mom doesn &apos;t think you can .
nobody can .
haley , listen to me .
listen to me .
i know this seems impossible .
but this is for all those times
that mom told you she was right ...
and you knew she was wrong .
i &apos;ll do it .
that &apos;s my girl .
you know , that guy &apos;s got a beautiful stroke .
look at his pants- no pleats . i like pants like that .
you think i can get away with something like that ?
sure . why not ?
listen , shorty , uh , we know each other a long time , right ?
what , 30 years ?
yeah .
and , um , i sense that you got a secret ...
that &apos;s maybe causing you a lot of anguish .
you heard something , right ?
well , i had the same situation with my son , mitchell .
really ?
yeah , and i didn &apos;t handle it too well either .
and , uh , i just want you to know
that you can open up to me ,
that i &apos;m gonna do all i can to help you .
well , i mean i-
i never said this out loud before to anyone .
but i guess , if i did , it would be you .
it &apos;s just that , jay , you see , i &apos;m , uh-
i &apos;m-
go ahead . yeah . go ahead .
i &apos;m in debt .
huh ?
i owe a bookie 20 g &apos;s , and he &apos;s a serious guy .
and you offering to give me the dough- this is beautiful .
wait a minute . you &apos;re not gay ?
gay ?
what are you talkin &apos; about- gay ?
i &apos;m not gay . where &apos;d you get gay ?
come on . i mean , you &apos;re always
talking about clothes and everything , right ?
my father was a tailor . i like clothes .
so what ?
are you calling my father gay ?
no !
my father landed on normandy
to save your ass .
you know , if you weren &apos;t lending me 20 g &apos;s ,
i &apos;d knock you out right now .
take a check ?
cash would be better .
haley . you ready ?
let &apos;s do this .
turn on the tv .
angela says , after he colored her hair-
nice .
it turned gray and then green .
mute it .
un @-@ mute it .
sixty @-@ five dollars .
put on a dvd .
hairdresser
frederick longmire denies he &apos;s responsible .
skip forward .
wait .
okay . back to tv .
... better than that .
face !
don &apos;t get all cocky , phil .
let &apos;s see what happens to little haley ...
when i do ... this .
ho , ho , ho . ho ! face .
dad , wh- what do i do ?
don &apos;t panic . we went through this . just- just think .
give up . give up . admit defeat .
haley . -okay . - uh , let &apos;s see .
you put the remote on to tv mode ...
and then press &quot; input ... &quot;
till you get hdmi 1 and-
i did it !
she did it !
fine . you proved your point .
everybody in this house is smarter than me .
no , honey , you &apos;re missing the point .
i taught haley how to use the remote in 20 minutes .
so think how fast you can learn it .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
see what i &apos;m saying ?
mitchell , it &apos;s me !
hey , dad .
hi .
i &apos;m here to let you know your gaydar is broken .
shorty is not gay .
no . i , uh- i knew that .
i made that up to mess with you for dissing cam .
what ? that cost me 20,000 bucks .
what do you mean ?
i reached out to him to let him know it &apos;s okay to be gay .
y ou did ?
yeah .
right after one of the stranger golf lessons of my life .
turns out what he is is a lousy gambler ,
and now i &apos;m the one on the hook for it .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
then why are you smiling ?
i &apos;m- i &apos;m proud of you , dad . and you &apos;re growing .
just @-@ just stop it . please .
don &apos;t you see how hard this is for me ?
see , i used to be just like one of those guys . now look at me .
i got a house looks like little colombia .
i got a gay son and a chinese granddaughter .
vietnamese .
only you would know the difference .
don &apos;t worry , dad . not growing too much .
i &apos;m a little nervous .
don &apos;t be .
i &apos;m sure you look beautiful .
what do you think ?
look at you !
really ?
you &apos;re gonna be fighting men off with a stick .
i don &apos;t know about that .
cameron !
hi . sorry for the pop over ,
but i just wanted to bring you these ...
to thank you for babysitting lily again last night . -oh !
gracias ! you didn &apos;t need to do that .
you know i love lily .

whitney , this is cameron .
hello . it &apos;s nice to meet you .

one of my favorites .
me too .
okay , who is reading the forevers ?
i am .
i am so obsessed with this whole vampire thing right now .
me too .
i just met the sweetest guy named cameron .
i think he might be the one .
can people change ? i don &apos;t know .
people are who they are- give or take , yeah , 15 % .
that &apos;s how much people can change if they really want to .
well , i &apos;ll see you when i see you .
yeah , thanks for-
haley , sweetie , wake up .

i need you to teach me to use the tv .

that way . yeah .
and then press-

you know , helping me out with that jam .

two tickets to see the great michael bubly .
the guy sings like an angel .
he &apos;s gonna be outside at one of the amphitheaters .
gloria &apos;s gonna love it .
no . i &apos;m talkin &apos; about you and me .
oh , you and me .
