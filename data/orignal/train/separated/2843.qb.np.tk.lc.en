that was the 10th time i &apos;ve peed here .
it &apos;s also the 10th time you &apos;ve told us .
sorry , it must be hard to hear .
it &apos;s easier having babies playing &quot; bring in da funk &quot; on your bladder !
i am so sick of being pregnant . god !
i can &apos;t sleep , except on my back , which hurt . so i can &apos;t sleep .
my only happiness is from a cup of coffee ... which is decaf because i &apos;m pregnant !
you want a cookie ?
thank you so much !
so , honey , how are those mood swings coming ?
i haven &apos;t had any yet .
the one with the worst best man ever
hey , guys .
all right , here &apos;s the ring .
yes , yes ! a thousand times , yes !
any ideas for the bachelor party ?
before rings and bachelor parties , you have to decide who your best man will be .
oh , it &apos;s awkward .
i already asked chandler .
he got to do it at your first wedding .
i figured you &apos;d understand . i &apos;ve known him longer .
i don &apos;t have any brothers . i &apos;ll never be a best man .
you can be the best man when i get married .
i &apos;ll never get to be a best man !
wait , wait .
so you &apos;ll be my best man twice , and i won &apos;t be yours at all ?
of course , you can be my best man .
what about me ? you said i could .
i &apos;m not getting married !
it &apos;s a question for science @-@ fiction writers .
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s not me.-how could it not be me ?
i &apos;m not even
you know what ? that &apos;s it .
from now on , joey will be my best man .
yes ! shame about you , though .
stop it .
what ?
one of the babies is kicking .
that &apos;s a good thing.it &apos;s not kicking me . it &apos;s kicking another baby .
don &apos;t make me come in there !
do you have a big bowl i can borrow ?
there &apos;s one under the cabinet .
why do you need it ?
we &apos;re having a party tomorrow night .
are you planning on inviting us ?
no . later !
get your ass back here , tribbiani !
hormones .
how come you &apos;re having a party and we &apos;re not invited ?
it &apos;s ross &apos; bachelor party .
so ?
are you bachelors ?
are you strippers ?
then you &apos;re not invited .
then you &apos;re not invited to our party either .
what party ?
phoebe &apos;s baby shower .
baby shower ? that so doesn &apos;t sound like something i want to do .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m going to have a party .
that &apos;s so great . a party !
i don &apos;t know why .
this is what i got going for the party liquor @-@ wise .
get a lot of liquor .
great .
in terms of the invite list , i got you , me and chandler .
i &apos;ll invite gunther because we &apos;re talking pretty loud .
i &apos;ll be there .
i know it &apos;s your party ... but i &apos;d like to limit the number of museum geeks .
let &apos;s not invite any anthropologists . just the dinosaur dudes .
we &apos;ll need a six @-@ pack of zima .
hey , what are you doing ?
just planning my bachelor party with my best man .
good luck trying to top the last one .
it won &apos;t be that difficult since this one won &apos;t be ... in the basement of a pizza hut .
i &apos;m ross , i &apos;m ross . i &apos;m too good for the hut .
i gotta go pick up ben . everything sounds great .
keep it on the mellow side . a few guys hanging out .
no strippers or anything .
you got it .
see you later .
have fun planning your mellow party .
there will be strippers . he didn &apos;t say anything about no strippers .
he just said , &quot; no strippers . &quot;
i chose not to hear that .
look what i got , look what i got !
they make these for little people !
little village people .
look at this one . this is my favorite .
that is so sweet.phoebe will love dressing them .
except she won &apos;t be the one who gets to dress them .
she won &apos;t get to keep the babies .
my god , we are throwing the most depressing baby shower !
unless we give her all gifts she can use after her pregnancy .
like regular coffee . tequila ! -a carton of cigarettes !
she doesn &apos;t smoke.-it &apos;s the thought that counts .
it &apos;s a great idea.and those leather pants she &apos;s always wanted !
she &apos;ll love that !
what the hell is this ?
you thought it &apos;d make me feel better ? to give me something i can &apos;t use for two months ?
this sucks !
who gave me this ? -well , l
they told me you like them .
all right , then i &apos;m wrong . it &apos;s a great gift . the best present i ever got !
what &apos;s my next present ? we don &apos;t have anything .
all right , fine , then this is over .
balloons !
listen , about the stripper .... -yeah ?
good call !
so i &apos;ll be hosting your next bachelor party ?
joey , i &apos;m kind of hoping this will be my last one .
a little announcement .
i &apos;ve decided that my best man is my best friend gunther .
what &apos;s my last name ?
central perk ?
thanks for not marrying rachel .
hey , gunther ! don &apos;t forget your shirt .
what are those ? little party favors . check it out .
just want everybody to know the position of my best man is still open .
so is the position of the bride .
great .
smooth , man.you got some chili on your neck .
i just want to say thanks , everyone . this was great !
see you guys monday morning .
thanks , joey .
don &apos;t forget your shirt .
hey , museum geeks ! party &apos;s over .
wave bye @-@ bye to the nice lady . there you go .
back to your parents &apos; basement . all right .
boys , come on out . here you go .
look at the birdies ! are those yours ?
they let you keep chickens and ducks as pets ?
and i got the duck totally trained too .
stare at the wall .
hardly move .
be white .
you are good at that .
i had fun tonight.-you throw one hell of a party .
thanks . it was great meeting you .
if any of my friends ever get married or have a birthday or a tuesday ....
yeah , that &apos;d be great .
so , i guess , good night .
unless you want to hang around .
i &apos;ll let you play with my duck .
stripper !
the stripper stole the ring !
chandler , get up ! the stripper stole the ring !
what ?
the ring is gone !
just give me a minute to wake up for this .
you lost the ring . you &apos;re the worst best man !
this isn &apos;t funny . i go to sleep , everything &apos;s cool .
i wake up , the stripper &apos;s gone , and the ring is gone !
you slept with her ?
of course !
hi , guys .
hi , phoebe .
i wanted to apologize if i seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower .
just the hormones .
no , we
hormones .
i wanted to say thank you . it was so sweet .
you seem to be doing much better .
how are things going ?
good .
everything &apos;s been about me lately . so what &apos;s happening with you ?
we were just talking about me not going to ross &apos; wedding .
it just might be too hard , given the history and all that .
this reminds me of the time when i lived on the street .
this guy offered to buy me food if i slept with him .
how is this like that ?
well , let &apos;s see . it &apos;s not really like that .
because that was an actual problem .
and yours is just a bunch of high @-@ school crap ... that nobody really gives !
i &apos;m sorry . i just thought
here come the water works .
i called the company that sent her , and they don &apos;t care .
i called 911 and they yelled at me . this is an emergency !
i really wanna help you out , but i got plans to go see titanic ...
... so i &apos;ve got to call 911 to find out what time it starts .
hey , guys .
thanks again for last night . what a great party.the guys from work had a blast .
one of them had never been to a bachelor party before .
another one had never been to a party before .
so that wedding ring .
man , that is nice .
yeah , right ?
i might pick one of those babies up for myself.where might one get one of those ?
that ring ?
when my grandmother first came to this country ...
... that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her .
so you might say that the ring is irreplaceable .
absolutely . it &apos;s been in my family for generations .
every bride who &apos;s worn it has lived a long and happy life .
so you might say it &apos;s a magic ring .
yeah , the stripper stole it .
what ?
what did you just
i think i heard what he said.i believe it was ,
&quot; the stripper stole the ring . &quot;
my ring ? my wedding ring ? the stripper stole my wedding ring ?
how could this happen ?
it all started when you said , &quot; joey , you be my best man ! &quot;
all right . i &apos;m going to call the cops .
i screwed up . but you don &apos;t have to turn me in .
not on you , on the stripper .
i already did that.they said they &apos;d look into it after they solve all the murders .
we &apos;ll call the company that sent her .
i did that too.they wouldn &apos;t give me her real name .
they said if i bother them again , they &apos;d call the police .
i said , &quot; you talk to the police , you tell them i &apos;m missing a ring . &quot;
so , what are you telling me ? there &apos;s nothing we can do ?
how could this happen ?
look , ross , i am so sorry .
what if we just called her ... used a fake name and had her come to my office ?
that sounds like fun , but we got a ring to find !
here &apos;s your tea , phoebe .
it &apos;s so good .
thanks .
good .
so glad you like it .
what ? she made the tea .
i think i just had a contraction .
what ?
my god !
i felt one a few minutes ago.that definitely was one .
you can &apos;t have the baby here.i haven &apos;t sterilized the apartment since the guys moved out !
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll boil some water and rip up some sheets .
it &apos;s probably false labor .
that can happen near the end . just get the book .
get the book !
the book !
the bible ?
i don &apos;t know !
all right . this is great .
you get behind the desk .
when she comes in , she won &apos;t recognize you because well , why would she ?
and then you buzz ross and l .
you be mr. gonzales , and i &apos;ll be mr. wong .
diverse .
anybody call for security ?
you be cool .
which one is gunther central perk ?
joey .
where &apos;s my ring ? my dead grandmother &apos;s wedding ring .
way to be cool , man .
what ?
there was a ring in a box . after you left , it was gone .
you think i stole some ring ?
we know you took it ! just save yourself the time and confess .
who are you , the hardy boys ?
i don &apos;t need to steal a stupid ring . i make $ 1,600 a week .
any of you guys make that ?
marry me .
i don &apos;t get it . it was in my room all night . she didn &apos;t take it .
i didn &apos;t take it . you didn &apos;t take it . then who did ?
we &apos;re trying to think .
i don &apos;t get how you know it &apos;s false labor .
do you see any babies ?
how do you feel ?
okay , i guess .
i don &apos;t know.i know it &apos;s going to be over soon so
but isn &apos;t that a good thing ? you said you were sick of this .
i know.usually , when you &apos;re done with the pregnant thing ... you get to do the mom thing .
but i &apos;ll be sitting around in my leather pants , drinking tequila .
some moms do that .
that &apos;s even sadder .
look , i know what i got myself into .
it &apos;s just that now that they &apos;re in me ...
it &apos;s like i know them and
it just won &apos;t be easy when these babies have to go away .
i know , sweetie.but it &apos;s not like you won &apos;t have anything .
you &apos;ll have nieces and nephews . that &apos;s even better .
yeah , okay .
no , really .
you won &apos;t be the one worrying about saving for college .
or yelling at them when they &apos;re bad .
or putting them on ritalin when they just won &apos;t calm down .
you &apos;ll be the one they run away to . the one they talk to about sex .
you just get to be cool aunt phoebe .
cool aunt phoebe .
i am pretty cool .
and you know what else ? are they going to love you !
they are going to love me .
thanks , you guys . again .
oh , sweetie.thanks.
what ? just kidding .
oh , my god !
got you again . you &apos;re so easy !
if anything happens to him the vet said it &apos;s a simple procedure .
things can go wrong . what if he doesn &apos;t make it ?
he will , joe .
but what if he doesn &apos;t ?
he &apos;s such a good duck .
i &apos;m so worried about him !
somebody lose a ring ?
oh , my god ! thank you ! thank you so much !
how &apos;s the duck ?
just fine . you &apos;ll see him in a bit .
great .
thanks for being so cool .
no , that &apos;s all right .
you made me your best man and i totally let you down .
it &apos;s not your fault .
yeah , it is .
you wouldn &apos;t have lost it .
ross , you were right . he should be your best man .
no , you should .
don &apos;t argue .
i get to choose my best man .
i want both you guys .
really ?
both you guys should be up there with me .
you two are my
i &apos;m lucky to have just one good
thanks , man .
i got to go check something , okay ?
what a baby !
total wuss .
how come you &apos;re getting nana &apos;s ring ?
mom gave it to me .
she said something about it being a wedding ring and that you may not need ... one .
i really didn &apos;t need to tell you all that .
i don &apos;t really think it &apos;s fair . i mean , i &apos;ve always loved that ring .
oh , mon , i &apos;m sorry.i &apos;d let you have it , but emily &apos;s gotten really attached to it .
thanks .
here you go .
thanks .
emily , did you know that that ring spent two days in a duck &apos;s colon ?
