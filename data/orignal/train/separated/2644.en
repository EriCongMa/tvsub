Karakurt.
We know you're working for the cabal.
How was the virus delivered?
You've been set up.
You infected the senator, and now they will come for you.
Suspect's name is Special Agent Elizabeth Keen.
But as of today, she's a fugitive.
Dembe's missing.
Where is Raymond Reddington?
So be it.
We're gonna die in here.
What would you do to help Elizabeth Keen?
Anything.
I'm happy to report your funds have cleared, Gerald.
You'll have full use of the penthouse suite until 9:00 A.M.
That's when the clean-up crew arrives.
Thank you. I can't tell you --
Oh, you don't have to say anything.
I'm terribly sorry for your loss.
This man's drugs ate my son alive.
And now you'll deliver payment in kind.
Shall we wake him?
The hour of vengeance has arrived.
The road to healing begins tonight.
What happens next is up to you.
Oh, and if you find that you can't finish your meal,
we've provided takeout bags in the kitchen.
第三季第四集
第43号
You know him?
No.
Neither did I.
Had to dig out my agency rolodex to find someone who recognized him.
Name's Matias Solomon -- a real lone wolf.
He was CIA?
Asset only.
In Ethiopia until he joined the Eritrean war.
Solomon committed atrocities on the battlefield so vulgar
even the CIA disavowed him.
I need you to find him, Leonard.
I appreciate you wanting to help your associate,
but Solomon's been M.I.A. for a decade.
Dembe is more than an associate to me.
Please find him.
Excuse me.
Who are...
Aram.
Surprise.
What are you doing in my apartment?
And, uh, who was that guy?
I'm sorry for the intrusion.
I'm here because I need your help.
Where's Agent Keen?
Something's happened to her, hasn't it?
Yes, thank God.
I got a shower for the first time in days.
I'm so happy to see you.
Not many people are these days.
Okay, I probably shouldn't say this,
but you look fantastic.
Aram.
We're looking for a woman who calls herself the Djinn.
A matchmaker of sorts,
who pairs clients with what they most desire --
greed, lust, revenge.
They say she can make any fantasy come true.
We have a web address.
There are encryptions we can't decipher.
I know this is asking a lot,
but we wouldn't come to you
if Reddington didn't believe that this Djinn might be helpful
in clearing my name.
If I agree to help...
I'll have to let Agent Ressler know.
We're in a symbiotic relationship.
By helping us, Agent Ressler keeps us close.
I have to believe Ressler wants the truth
about who attacked our country just as much as we do.
If that's true, he'll accept help anywhere he can get it.
He wouldn't take it from Tom.
What? Tom? I-I don't understand.
He knows you're in trouble.
He came and offered to help,
and Agent Ressler turned him down.
The Djinn -- we need to find the Djinn.
If you want to help Keen, this is how you do it.
Find Karakurt.
The Cabal hired him to do what she's being framed for --
the OREA bombing, the senator's murder.
Yeah, I know Karakurt. He's Russian garbage.
Probably hitting some strip club in St. Petersburg right now.
Karakurt betrayed his country.
If he went back to Russia,
the FSB would shoot him on sight.
My intel says he's had extensive plastic surgery.
He's trying to change his identity.
Says here you had him in custody and you let him go.
It also says Karakurt's sister
is married to Charlie Volkens --
violent, unstable.
He runs a crime ring in the Rust Belt.
Word is that's where Karakurt's laying low.
Why come to me? Hmm?
Your boy Ressler told me to hit the highway.
Donald Ressler's a fine agent.
Within the rules, he'll do everything possible
to find Elizabeth and the truth.
You don't think that'll be enough?
Maybe.
Given what we're up against, I'm willing --
Throw out the rulebook.
Bend the bindings a little.
All right, so what's the FBI doing about this?
I assume their entire focus is on Reddington and Keen.
You "assume."
Don't you know?
I'm on leave from the task force
while they investigate my part
in the shooting of Tom Connolly.
So this isn't a sanctioned op.
No. I'm asking you to figure out a way to infiltrate the crime ring
that may be protecting Karakurt.
If you're caught, something happens,
you're on your own.
I had no knowledge of this.
I walked in, and they were just there.
We have a confirmed sighting.
I live at the Nottingham apartments.
Tell MPD to shut down a five-block radius around Adams Morgan.
Reset the checkpoints. Notify all agencies.
Run it into the ground.
I know you think she's innocent,
but you did the right thing coming forward.
Uh, Mr. Reddington asked me to.
Why would he do that?
Because he needs our help finding the Djinn.
Who's the Djinn?
The kidnap and rape of a British princess.
公主在被绑架 强奸后 被丢弃在急症室外
The mauling death of a big-game poacher locked in a lion's cage.
丛林之王成功复仇
The vivisection of a drug dealer while he was eaten alive.
According to Mr. Reddington,
these are not random acts of perverse cruelty.
Each was a revenge fantasy,
planned and providing by a woman known only as the Djinn.
The Djinn?
You mean, like a genie?
All I know is, they believe she can help clear Agent Keen's name.
The Djinn apparently grants your deepest, darkest wish.
If you can imagine it and pay for it...
she'll make it happen.
How do you contact this...Djinn?
Right. In the early days of the web,
a virtual fantasy world was created online
to connect people of all ages from around the world.
The technology was qukly obsolete,
but the site was never taken down.
状态 中立 位置 市政厅 准备中
Today, it is a hidden oasis for freaks and weirdos.
状态 中立 位置 市政厅 准备中
No digital signatures. Tor-encrypted on the dark web.
It offers anonymity for new clients to contact the Djinn.
Once you locate her avatar,
状态 中立 位置 市政厅 准备中
The Djinn invites you to a private room,
状态 中立的 位置 市政厅 准备中
where you give her your name and bank account.
That's it.
You sign off.
The Djinn verifies your financial resources.
If she likes what she sees,
she contacts you directly to set a meeting.
I don't buy it.
I mean, if they're trying to prove Keen's innocence,
why go after some high-priced vigilante?
And if that's not what they're trying to prove,
why risk everything asking for Aram's help?
Why do any of what they've done?
A Troll Farmer, a counterfeiter,
a company that launders money for the Cabal,
now this Djinn -- it doesn't make sense.
They're fugitives, but they're not running.
They're searching.
But if not for Keen's innocence, then what for?
Well, we know they're trying to set up a meeting,
but we have to find a where and when.
If we can find the Djinn first, maybe we can intercept them.
Cross-reference all our known cases.
Look for the I.P. addresses,
how her clients communicated with her,
anything that can provide a clue to her identity.
You did it.
No. You did.
Your hour of vengeance has arrived.
The road to healing begins now.
What happens next is up to you.
Allah teaches us forgiveness,
but some things -- they're unforgivable.
Do you have to torture me, too?
I'm preparing for my next interrogation.
With a spoon?
I counted four men.
You might get two before they kill you.
So be it.
When Solomon figures out he can't break me,
he'll go after my daughter, her little girl.
Whatever it takes to find Raymond.
If I'm dead, they're safe.
I found a link.
The revenge fantasies arranged by the Djinn
occurred around the world,
but two of them drove down the earnings of one company.
How?
Well, it seems cannibalism isn't good for business.
The victim's body was found in a dumpster outside the hotel
wrapped in hotel towels.
Now no one wants to sleep there.
Just like no one wants to fly a certain airline in South America.
It went bankrupt after a hijacking planned by the Djinn.
Azeri Financial is a majority shareholder
in both the airline and the hotel.
It's a private holding company in New York.
Two is hardly a pattern. Maybe it's just a coincidence.
It could be, but it's not. Aram?
That is Bahram Bakhash,
owner and C.E.O. of Azeri Financial.
The abduction took place two hours ago.
So far, there have been no ransom demands.
Well, if someone hired this Djinn to bankrupt Azeri Financial,
we need a motive.
And more importantly --
what does any of this have to do with Keen?
"I am not courageous.
Only the poor have courage.
Why? Because they are hopeless.
To get up every morning to plow a potato field in wartime,
to bring kids with no prospects into the world.
to live poor -- that takes courage."
Ugh. I forget the next line.
You're a terrible actor.
There's nothing wrong with my performance.
It's the play.
Bertolt Brecht uses the alienation effect
to create emotional distance from the audience.
I don't know.
So, why did you produce his play?
I was completely swept up
in the idealism of the theatre owner --
A pipe-smoking cream puff of a German named Gerta.
She read "Mother Courage" to me aloud --
the whole play in one sitting.
A brilliant exploration of the politics of war
and those who profit from it.
Sadly, it was 1991,
and audiences were going in droves to see "Cats."
Gerta lost every penny of my investment,
but she remains grateful to this day.
Her theater is ours as long as we need it.
The Djinn. We have a meeting point --
a bench in Astoria Park tomorrow at 9:00 A.M.
When she arrives, keep her in the open until I move in.
This woman -- the Djinn --
You said she can help, but you haven't said how.
I have reason to believe that
at least two of the people she's catered to
are powerful members of the Cabal.
And if we get to her, we can get to them.
In case we lose visual contact,
you'll be wearing a tracking device.
If you're thinking of reaching out to him, don't.
Now that he's on the FBI's radar,
they're likely monitoring any communications.
This is important, Lizzy.
Promise me you won't call him.
I promise.
We should get some rest.
She hasn't called yet. More tea?
Sure.
Karakurt had extensive facial surgery.
Do you know anyone who would want to hurt your father?
No.
No one. He's a devout man.
Respected, with many friends.
When did you see him last?
Here. This morning.
He called a board meeting to discuss a hostile takeover.
How hostile?
The Newcastle Venture Group is an investment firm.
They made an aggressive buyout proposal.
Which your father opposed?
Yes. He wants the company to stay in the family.
In his absence, would the board approve of the buyout?
Buyout proposals happen all the time.
No one gets kidnapped because of them.
Look, my father raised my sister, Nasim, and me
after our mother was killed by a bomb during the Iran-Iraq war.
He's everything to us.
Please.
Find our father, bring him back to us.
Nice to make your acquaintance, Elizabeth.
If you'll be so kind as to follow my instructions,
we'll be having a lovely visit in no time.
First, I'll need you to leave your cellphone.
Opposite you, there's a gap in the fence.
Follow the path until you find some portable restrooms.
Walk there now, and enter the one on the right.
Freeze! You! Don't move!
Get there now.
You did well, Elizabeth.
For my privacy and your safety, I'm turning off the lights.
Wait. W-where are we going?
Enjoy the ride.
I'll have a cup of hot tea waiting.
I've called everyone.
It's as if he just vanished.
There's been no demand for a ransom or anything --
just silence.
What can I do, Hamid? I feel so helpless.
I put out a reward for any information,
and the FBI assures me they're doing everything they can.
They want to talk to you. I'll text you their number.
Yes, of course. Anything I can do to help.
I'll finish up what I'm doing here and then call them.
Man Az Samime ghalbam.
That was Hamid.
He's worried about you, father.
He should be.
I know this may seem barbaric to you,
but no more so than what you did to me.
Elizabeth.
Thank you for enduring my security measures.
Please, take off your shoes.
Get comfortable.
It's not often I'm contacted by an international fugitive.
We do our homework.
Why don't you tell me your fantasy,
and let's see if we can help?
"If"?
Not all wishes are granted.
We help at our discretion.
I want revenge.
You have my full attention.
I was framed.
I want the people who did this to admit it
and pay for what they've done.
I don't believe that.
It's what I want.
I'm sure it is.
You wouldn't be human if it wasn't.
But I'm not interested in what you want.
I'm interested in what you deeply desire.
I can sense that death and vengeance
aren't what drive you, Elizabeth.
Or feed your soul.
What does?
A lost world, I suspect. Another life.
Why don't you tell me about that fantasy,
and maybe I can help you?
If you can't face your truths, I can't be of service.
My car will return you to Astoria Park.
I'm sorry.
Hamid's right.
I can't think of anyone who would want to harm my father.
He's a good man.
Your father's company --
I have nothing to do with the company.
The Newcastle Venture Group --
We understand they're mounting a hostile takeover.
Did your father ever mention them to you?
No, I don't think so.
We know that it's a front,
but we don't know who's behind it yet.
Your father never mentioned them?
My father never talks business with me.
Surely you must know how that is, Samar Navabi.
I know how that is.
But I took control of my life a long time ago.
Then you're braver than I.
长岛市 纽约州
Nasim?
Nasim?
Forgive me for intruding.
Nasim?
Hamid.
There you are.
Have you heard anything about father?
No.
It's gonna be okay.
The FBI are doing everything they can.
I know nothing else matters right now,
but I need your advice.
You're the only one who values it.
The board members -- they're nervous.
They were nervous even before father was abducted.
Quarterly earnings, share value, and now with him gone,
I've tried to convince them to wait,
that to decide the fate of the company
at a time like this is insane.
They won't listen.
I want him to be proud of me.
Father groomed you to be his successor
because he trusts you.
He has confidence in you. The board will listen to you.
It's a fair offer. Take it.
It should have been you.
Running the company.
The bias, the prejudice.
He should have seen past it.
I just pray they find him.
Your turn, chief.
Not so fast.
Lift your pant leg up. The right one.
Let's see what's in the sock.
I had to give them something. They made me.
Okay, that's enough!
Raise your hands! Face to the wall!
You didn't have to hit me that hard.
That wasn't part of the plan.
Get his weapon.
Wait.
Hello?
Hi. I'm sorry. Is...
It's you. Calling for the guy.
Y-yeah.
I can't believe it.
He was hoping you'd call.
He wanted me to give you this number.
Lizzy?
What is it?
555-0123.
When he comes back, do you want me to...
What happened with the Djinn?
We tracked you to the warehouse,
but then you were gone and the tracking signal left the city.
She had guards, so I couldn't ask her about the Cabal.
I gave her the story, but she didn't believe I was being honest.
She wanted to know my real fantasy.
So.
Well, I didn't say anything.
I put the bug on her shoe.
What is your fantasy?
It's been the same thing for as long as I can remember.
I'm walking in a park with my husband.
In between us is our little girl.
I'm holding her hand in mine...
and I never let go.
Thanks to your shoe switcheroo,
apparently we have an address for the Djinn.
Hi, there. Is your mommy home?
You're not the Djinn.
What are you doing?
Looking at the classifieds.
"Tuba mouthpiece for sale"?
The number will lead us to Reddington.
Thanks. All I wanted to hear.
Oh, my God!
You followed me.
What's the Djinn's name?
Is that why you came to me?
So that I'd give up the Djinn?
I won't do that.
Let's forget about the Djinn for a moment.
I'd be more intrigued to hear about you, Alice.
I'm sure you have a story to tell.
I love stories.
I used to work the convention circuit,
standing next to supercars all day in heels and short shorts.
As a brand ambassador,
you're trained to answer questions and push product.
The Ddjinn found me through an agency I work with.
Most of our clients are men. They enjoy a little eye candy.
When I started,
the Djinn scripted every word I said,
but I guess I had a knack for reading people,
knowing their desires.
In time, I became the face of the operation.
I imagine selling fantasies is a very profitable business,
one you are clearly not profiting from.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
The Range Rover in the driveway,
those diamond earrings, your shoes --
Your aspirations clearly exceed your reality.
I've been preparing to quit.
I have more than enough money.
Lies on top of pretense, my dear.
You haven't quit because you enjoy the power.
There's no shame in that.
Do I look ashamed?
No, you do not.
It appears we're all good at reading people. What fun.
But, Alice, I don't think you see
that we have an opportunity here
to make both of our fantasies come true.
The Djinn is a middleman I believe you've outgrown.
Tell me his name.
Tell me all about him, and I'll get him out of your way.
You can launch your own operation.
Maybe one that's a little more optimistic and constructive
than the present business model.
I even have your first client all lined up.
So, this Djinn -- tell me.
That's your chest collapsing. That feeling?
Asphyxiation will be next.
Your suffering is almost over.
I wish the same could be said for mine.
I did what I had to...
to keep you alive.
You did what you did because you couldn't stand to look at me.
Well, I am making you look at me now.
Look at me, father!
Your company is gone.
Hamid and the board sold it to the Newcastle Venture Group.
That's not possible.
You know, for years,
I had dreamt of ways to get my revenge on you.
So many fantasies swimming in my head.
So many that they gave birth to a business.
As the Djinn, I make people's fantasies come true.
You have no idea how much people will pay
to experience their darkest desires.
And I've been collecting that money
so that one day I could live out my own fantasy.
And guess what day it is, father.
You said I was unfit to run a company.
Now I own one -- yours.
Newcastle Venture Group is mine.
I figured it out.
I had to go through six pass-throughs
and two loan-outs in the Caymans, but --
Aram.
You look nice today.
Aram. What did you figure out?
Right. The Newcastle Venture Group --
Nasim bakhash controls it.
Bahram's daughter.
And the board of Azeri Financial just approved the buyout offer.
And that only happened because Bahram wasn't there to oppose it.
That's what this is -- her revenge fantasy.
She's getting back at her father for cutting her out.
That's why she kidnapped him.
And the only question is, has she killed him yet?
Aram, get an address, get units en route now.
Found my way into the crime ring.
"New York's hottest bachelors"?
Page 32.
Asher Sutton? I don't know who that is.
He's my fast pass to finding Karakurt.
How does the only child of a billionaire resort owner
get you anywhere near the crime syndicate
where Karakurt's hiding?
Trust me. It does.
I believe we've already established
that I don't trust you.
I believe we've also established that you need me.
Look. If this world where Karakurt is hiding were easy to get to,
I'd have gotten there myself.
If this Asher kid somehow has access to it,
what makes you think he's gonna take you there?
Because he's got a weakness.
For street life, hustlers, players --
anybody who has to fight for their money.
Go on.
Asher spends most of his nights
at an underground casino in New York.
All I need is a good story.
Graduated Princeton. Summers in the Hamptons.
Maybe you should tell him
how you learned to channel lady luck in college
during a weekend bender in Sag Harbor.
Sag harbor. Okay. Yeah.
Yeah, you know what? I remember that weekend.
You know, it was my junior ye--
No, it was my sophomore year.
And my roommate at Princeton, Sammy --
Sammy? I don't think so.
Right.
Not Sammy.
Samuel, his parents had a beach house in, uh, Sag Harbor...
...that he said was flush with bikinis every summer.
So, come July, we want to get lucky, right?
So we hit the beach, you know,
like Samuel said -- scores of girls.
But the problem is -- they're all high-school girls.
Right? Jailbait.
15 will get you 10 to 20.
You know what I'm saying?
So forget it. We just drink every night.
You know, make the most of our fleeting youth.
And on the last day, we hit the beach one more time.
And there lies the most beautiful college girl
you've ever seen.
I mean, ever.
But it's two guys, and there's one girl.
So I strike first.
I sit down, I start talking to her,
and she says she's hungry.
So I get up, I go to the Sag General to buy her a cappuccino muffin.
But when I come back, there's Samuel lying on top of her
and their lips are locked like a jigsaw puzzle.
You know what I mean?
So I do the death march back to my towel.
I'm just gonna sleep off the rest of my hangover, you know?
"Forget about this day." But I can't sleep.
Because I got something hard stuck under my head, right?
So I reach under my towel,
and you're never gonna believe what I find lost in the sand.
So I go back to school the next day
with a $12,000 Bvlgari on my wrist,
and Samuel -- he goes back with a brand-new cold sore.
That's the day that I learned
that luck is just what you make of it.
That's a dope watch, Mr. Wainright.
You have a good evening,
and, uh, good luck in there tonight.
Hey, let's hope.
Alice was right. No guards.
What? What is it?
You've been quiet ever since we left Alice.
Is it Dembe?
It's your fantasy.
What about it?
It's as it should be.
Look at that.
Pinned like a swallowtail.
Oh, my.
No, no, no. Let's not fuss with that now.
Our priority's to find Nasim.
He won't be alive. Look at him. He needs medical attention.
I'm not sure we should start the party
before the hostess arrives, but so be it.
Yes. Hello.
I need an ambulance.
A man's dying on a cross.
Aram, we're five minutes out.
That's good, because a 911 call
was just placed from Nasim's home,
And the caller was Mr. Reddington.
Are you positive?
Voice analysis confirmed it.
Reddington. He's already there.
Nasim. There you are.
Please, come in.
We have much to discuss, and time is a factor.
What do you want?
To offer my sympathies.
I know who you are.
And I know who you are, Nasim.
What a beautiful name. It means "Breeze" in Farsi.
But you weren't born Nasim.
You were born Nasir -- "The victorious."
How ironic.
But a boy. A perfectly healthy boy.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Alice told us the story.
We know you're the Djinn.
And this must be your father.
The butcher.
Tell me, Bahram,
was it so horrific to discover that your 19-year-old son,
your eldest son, was gay?
So horrific that you forced him against his will
to go under the knife, change his gender,
to give you a daughter instead of your son, who is gay?
Clerics accept...
people can get trapped in the body of the wrong sex.
The law says
I wasn't trapped.
I liked my body.
I liked men.
I wanted to protect you, Nasim.
They could have killed you.
For being gay.
They're so homophobic that being gay is a hideous crime,
but chopping off a man's penis isn't?
Honestly, is it just me, or is the human race,
armed with religion, poisoned by prejudice,
and absolutely frantic with hatred and fear,
galloping pell-mell back to the dark ages?
Who on earth is hurt by a little girl going to school
or a child being gay?
Let's be frank, Bahram.
You didn't change your son to protect him.
You changed him because he disgusted you.
That's not true.
You violated my body without consent.
You sliced out my identity
and discarded it as waste.
You cursed me to live the rest of my life
as a second-class citizen,
despite being a firstborn son.
We're running out of time.
Get what you came for, and let's go.
What did you come for?
A leather journal -- hand-written --
with the names of all your clients
and their adventures in wonderland,
but I suggest you find it fast
before the authorities outside break down your door.
What did you do?
As a general rule,
I'm against the militarization of America's police forces,
but I needed an army, so there they are.
I've prepared an escape for Elizabeth and I,
and there's room for you, too,
but the price for your freedom is one leather journal.
Now who's the Djinn?
Agents Navabi and Ressler.
Where are we at?
We set the perimeter.
Our fourth side is water,
and we're waiting for harbor units.
No sign of the targets.
They're in there.
I want a full layout of that property,
and position teams to cover all the exits.
Yes, sir.
I should have never agreed to this.
Risking everything, for what?
Another list of names. How valuable can they be?
All part of the master plan
to clear your name, I assure you.
Helicopters.
Not even you can get us out of this.
You want to know my fantasy, Nasim?
To escape a hopeless police standoff in style
with two sensational women on my arms.
Shall we?
Yeah.
Well, we can't have everything.
We're gonna breach on my command.
SWAT will follow.
Reddington and Keen are inside.
They're armed -- lieutenant, are you listening?
That chopper.
What about it?
It's not mine.
Reddington.
Let's go now.
Move, move!
Welcome aboard, Elizabeth.
Excellent.
I gave you the journal. I kept my end of the deal.
Your deal was with him.
Women.

♬Don't worry, be happy♬
♬Oh, you keep telling yourself♬
♬Everything's gonna be okay♬
We caught a predator.
You should be proud.
That journal had names, dates, locations.
The DOJ.'s going to close dozens of cases.
There was one page torn out --
the one that Reddington wanted.
Whatever he's doing, he's gonna get her killed.
You can't save her. You shouldn't even try.
Liz made a choice to kill the Attorney General.
She said it was the only way that she could stop him.
I've stopped men the same way,
and I'm ready to pay the price.
Liz needs to be ready, too.
♬Oh, here comes trouble♬
Nobody made her pull that trigger.
♬Put your helmet on♬
♬We'll be heading for a fall♬
So, I go back to school the next day
with a $12,000 Bvlgari on my wrist,
And Samuel-- he goes back with a brand-new cold sore, right?
And that's the day
that I learned that luck is what you make of it.
Blow on that for me. Thank you very much.
♬Don't worry, be happy♬
One more seven!
♬Oh, you keep telling yourself♬
♬Everything's gonna be okay♬
♬Everything's gonna be okay♬
Have a good night.
Oh, you're good.
What's that?
You switched the dice
while you were showing off your fake watch.
That's a clever misdirect,
but the house dice are in your right pocket.
Have another drink, pal.
Oh, no, no, no.
You won't make it to the front door if I don't want you to.
The Sag General wasn't selling cappuccino muffins
when you were in college,
if you even went to college.
What do you want?
Oh, I want to take you to dinner.
You're a fascinating character, Mr. Wainright.
Or whatever your name actually is.
Yeah.
Tom.
You called Wing Yee's. I was hoping you would.
I can't believe you came back.
Of course I came back. As soon as I heard, I came back.
Are you all right?
You had a plan.
The boat...
I wish you would have come with me.
I know you went to Ressler and offered to help.
Yeah, I did.
And I'm gonna do everything I can.
Listen, Tom, you don't have to do this.
I do have to do this.
You said you wanted out of this life --
out of the secrets and the lies and the risk.
I don't want to be the one to drag you back into this.
You're not. You haven't.
Listen, Tom, you-- you don't understand.
I have done so many terrible things.
I have hurt so many people.
I don't care what you've done.
Liz, I know who you are.
I took that for granted for a long time,
but I don't now.
So you're right. I do have plans. I'm coming to save you.
Tom. Listen--
It's too late.
'Cause I'm already in.
In where?
Where are you? What have you done?
I got to go. I love you.
So, what's good around here?
Follow me.
