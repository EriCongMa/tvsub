Red One, Pilgrim seems to be
experiencing a malfunction with its SPR collector.
Please assess.
Copy that, Mission Control.
What is this, glitch number 81?
Not that anyone's counting up here.
Mission Control thought math wasn't your strong suit. Over.
I could say the same about the guys
that built this bucket of bolts.
You guys find this thing in a cereal box?
I think you're hurting Pilgrim's feelings, Red One.
Red One, you have a situation 90 degrees to your left,
50 meters out. Please assess.
What the hell?
We've got a civilian.
Help me.
He just collapsed.
What is your status?
Red One, what is your status?
This guy's not breathing!
Come on. Breathe. Breathe.
Come on.
Red One, come in!
Breathe.
This is depressing.
Well, that's what happens when you live on an island
and you leave things to the last minute--
you get slim pickings, Danny.
That's very helpful. Thank you.
I'm just saying,
it's two days before Christmas-- all the good trees are gone.
You know what, you may want to think about going artificial.
No, no, no. The Williams family does not do fake trees, okay?
This.
Look at that.
This is beautiful. This I can do.
Hey. How you doing?
How you guys doing? She's a beauty, isn't she?
Yeah.
Beautiful.
Oh, that is a Colorado blue spruce.
Fresh in from Lana'i.
Now, that... is the Cadillac of Christmas trees.
All right. How much, uh, for the Cadillac of Christmas trees?
Well, today it's going for
the bargain-basement price of just $750.
And I'll throw in the tie-downs for you.
$750? What are you, nuts?
Steve, he's trying to stick me up. Arrest this guy.
Come on-- $750.
What are you guys, cops?
Yeah, we're cops. Five-O.
I'll knock a hundred bucks off for you.
No, that's still out of my price range.
Hey, not to worry. Listen,
for the budget-conscious, I got just the thing.
There you go.
What do I look like, Charlie Brown?
This is a youthful spruce.
It's a depressing twig that fell off the expensive tree.
What is this? You shouldn't even sell these trees.
Well, these are my best offerings here.
You're more than welcome to try another lot.
You know what?
Listen, forget this guy-- I got a better idea.
Thank you very much.
I'll give you $300 for that tree.
Save your money. I've got you covered.
Whoa. Hey, don't do it!
Wait! Whoa, wait!
Huh?
I changed my mind again.
I can't hear you.
I said I... I don't think this is a good idea.
Why would you say something like that?
Well, because "This is a protected forest preserve."
Right? Because "Removing trees is strictly prohibited."
Because "Violators will be punished to the full ex..."
I'm just reading from the big sign that we saw when we got here.
That sign that says things you should not do. That one.
Okay?
It's Christmas,Danny--
all right, you and Gracie need a tree.
You want a tree?
I do. I did. I want a tree, but not like this.
$750 is insane for a tree.
And every other lot is sold out.
Besides, look around-- what do you see here?
What do you see here?
Trees.
Lots and lots and lots of trees.
Yeah.
There's thousands of trees here.
They're not gonna miss one.
You know what I mean?
All right?
Wait, wait, wait. Wait! Wait!
I cannot believe you made me an accomplice to a crime.
A victimless crime.
The evidence to which is strapped to the roof of my car right now.
Danny, no one's gonna know where this tree came from, all right?
I'm gonna know where the tree came from, okay?
That's all I meant is, every time I look at it,
I'm gonna think how we broke the law to get it.
That's it. You tainted Christmas.
You know what you are?
Annoyed with this conversation.
You are a ruiner of Christmas.
You are a Scrooge.
Bah. Humbug.
Okay? All right.
Are you gonna answer it?
What am I, your valet service? It's your phone.
No, I got a meeting with the governor today.
You know that. If it's a case, it's for you.
Okay, do me a favor,
when you see the governor, make sure you tell him that you
spent the morning vandalizing his beautiful island,
okay?
Oh, my God.
Please hold for Mr. Malcontent. Thank you.
Detective Alawa?
Yes, sir.
Hey. Detective Williams.
Dr. Bergman. Captain Grover.
Thanks for flying over.
Where's the body?
It's this way.
He just stumbled into the test area and collapsed.
One of the members of the HI-SEAS group tried to resuscitate him,
but he was dead by the time paramedics arrived.
What's the HI-SEAS?
Oh, I can field this one, Detective.
HI-SEAS is the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation.
This rocky terrain here is very similar
to the surface you would find on Mars,
so they and other aerospace programs
have staged training simulations here for many years.
And they're taking this breach of security seriously.
Which is why you were asked to come out here.
You get an I.D. on the vic?
No wallet.
And no one at the facility recognizes him.
My guys are running prints now.
Detective, we need to set up a search perimeter.
Let's look for fresh tire tracks,
maybe an abandoned vehicle,
'cause there's no way
this guy just wandered up here on foot.
You got it.
Thanks, Detective.
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm doing what's called a preliminary examination.
I find it's sometimes useful in determining the cause of death.
Max, want to introduce us to your friend here?
We're not friends.
We're not friends.
Gentlemen,
this is Dr. Sanjeet Dhawan, the Hawai'i Island M.E.
We did our anatomical pathology residency together.
It's a pleasure, gents.
So, I-I'm a little confused.
How is it that the two of you are not friends?
It's complicated.
And I don't understand why Dr. Dhawan is here
in the first place considering the governor assigned Five-O
to investigate this incident.
While you may have jurisdiction here, Dr. Bergman,
there's only one M.E. office on this island.
Mine.
And if you're gonna be using it in this case,
I'm gonna have to insist on being involved.
Sounds great to me. Good to you?
Yeah. Fantastic. Any objections?
Multiple. Firstly... - Zip it, please, Max.
We got it.
Please, continue.
Well, I was just getting started,
but my initial thought was that the victim was suffering
from high-altitude pulmonary edema due to the elevation,
but then due to the lack of grayness or blue in the limbs,
I was able to rule that out.
Actually, you can rule out all natural causes.
I believe this man was poisoned.
Really? How do you know that?
Well... pinpoint pupils is a telltale sign that he was poisoned.
I'm surprised you missed this, Sanjeet.
I didn't miss anything.
Like I said, I was just getting started.
Also, pinpoints can often suggest an opiate overdose.
Unlike some M.E.'s, I don't like to speculate
until all the facts are in.
There's two of 'em.
Yeah.
Listen, I got an idea.
What say the two of you gentlemen
get this body over to the morgue.
That way you can settle whatever this is over there.
Oh... it is on.
Like Wrath of Khan.
You know, um, I say this often around Max,
but that was very, uh, strange.
No luck with ID, Detective.
Prints didn't get a match on AFIS.
Well, the guy is dressed like a cowboy.
There's a ton of ranches on this island.
Maybe he belongs to one of 'em?
You know, it's possible.
The closest ranch is 15 miles away.
I guess the question is, how does a cowboy...
end up dead on Mars?
What are you doing?
My job.
You should try it sometime.
No, I mean why are you fixating on
old contusions that are clearly unrelated to the cause of death?
That's right. Walk away.
Let the adults do their work.
I don't know how you put up with him.
Okay, Max, I want to know.
What is it between you two? Tell me.
Well, it's private.
And to discuss this in a professional environment
is highly inappropriate.
I don't care.
Fine, if you must know,
it was over a certain woman.
Enough said.
What's going on with our John Doe?
Well... - To begin with,
the autopsy confirmed my suspicions.
The COD was indeed poisoning.
What kind of poison?
We don't know yet.
The initial tox screen came back negative.
But we were able to narrow down the spectrum of...
Hold on. "We"?
Excuse me.
Dr. Dhawan
was able to narrow down the spectrum of possible poisons.
I discovered some excess substances in the victim's lungs.
There's only a few poisons that could cause that result.
Of course, additional tests will need to be performed to
determine which was the exact poison utilized to kill our victim.
All early indications point to TCVP.
Or perhaps a couple dozen other substances.
Okay, okay, okay. Do we at least know
how this mystery poison entered this gentleman's body?
Due to the lack of injection marks on the victim's body
and any indication that it was absorbed through the skin,
I can say with confidence it was likely ingested.
So the killer spiked something that he ate?
Or drank.
We'll know more once we analyze his stomach contents.
With any luck, we'll find some traces of the poison.
And even if we don't,
knowing the victim's last meal
could lead to some valuable information,
possibly leading to an ID.
Well, gentlemen, I'm sure our good doctor means well.
However, analyzing the stomach contents could take hours.
I, on the other hand,
already have an idea who our victim is.
Well, do you have his name?
Well, something close enough.
Gentlemen,
please note which part of the rider's body is utilized the most.
The wrist, the elbows, the shoulders,
the hips and the groin.
Our John Doe, at one time or another,
had suffered fractures in all of these parts.
Furthermore, I found traces of rosin on his hands.
Rosin is commonly used on a rider's glove
to enhance the bull rope grip.
All of these observations lead to an obvious conclusion,
that...
The guy was a bull rider.
That's right, lift it and go.
You gotta hang on to get this tram on board.
Let's cheer for him, folks.
He's got seconds left on the clock.
Let's hear it for St. Nick, everybody.
The old man's still got it.
I got to say, I'm a little bummed I didn't get to see Mars.
Then you should've taken the earlier flight.
You didn't miss anything. Trust me.
Wow, this really brings back some memories.
Yeah?
Yeah, my dad used to take us to the rodeo
when I was a kid whenever it came into town.
Used to sit right behind the bucking chutes.
Get to see the bulls up close.
Some of the paniolos even taught me
how to handle a rope.
I got to say, I don't see the appeal.
That's just me, personally, though, you know?
Can I help you, Officers?
Uh, yeah.
We're with Five-O. Um, who's, uh...
who's in charge around here?
Looking at 'em. Al Mokuau.
I organized today's event.
How you doing?
Good to meet you.
This is Jill Kuikahi. She manages all our riders.
Hi. How do you do?
Hi.
What can we do for you?
Do you know this man?
Oh, my God.
That's Keone Maka.
He's one of our riders. What-what happened?
He was found dead this morning up on Mauna Loa.
I can't believe this.
Do you have, uh...
uh, any idea why he might have been up there?
No.
Keone's day job was delivering hay and feed
to ranches on the island.
Most of his stops were made in the early morning.
Doesn't make any sense he'd be anywhere near Mauna Loa.
Can you tell us how he died?
All indications point to him being poisoned.
You're saying Keone was murdered?
Yeah.
Can you think of anyone who may have wanted to hurt him?
Luke.
Luke? Okay. Who's, uh... who's Luke?
Luke Pakele.
He's one of the other riders.
Keone came forward and accused Luke of cheating.
Claimed that Luke was injecting bulls with steroids.
Injecting bulls with steroids.
Why would he do that?
In bull riding, half your score is based upon
how long you stay on the bull.
The other half is how much it bucks.
A more aggressive bull means more points for the rider.
Exactly.
We took the accusation seriously,
so we checked out Luke's bull.
Sure enough, Keone was right.
The bull tested positive for steroids.
Okay. Then what happened?
We fired Luke the next day.
He also had to forfeit some of his prize money.
I can't imagine Luke was too happy about that.
No, ma'am.
So, I ran the name Luke Pakele.
The guy's been busted twice for cattle rustling.
Got a last known address?
Yeah, he lives in the Kalapana Lava Gardens.
I'm texting you the exact address right now.
Lava Gardens? That like, uh, molten lava?
You're gonna love it.
All right, I'm gonna get a CSU team over to Keone's house.
If Luke is our guy,
he could've poisoned something in Keone's house.
Maybe we'll find out what it is.
All right. Good luck.
Mahalo, cuz.
Hey, Pua. Howzit?
Lieutenant Kelly.
Can I help you with something?
Actually, I'm looking for Commander McGarrett
and Detective Williams.
Ah, you're out of luck.
Commander McGarrett's in meetings with the Governor,
and Detective Williams is on Hawai'i Island working a case.
Unavailable. Interesting.
Do you happen to know where they were this morning?
Actually, no, Pua. I don't keep tabs on 'em.
What's this about?
I'm not at liberty to say. Sorry.
Official police business.
Pua, I am police.
Please have Commander McGarrett
and Detective Williams contact me as soon as they can.
Seriously?
Thank you for your time and your cooperation. Aloha.
Aloha.
I don't get it.
Why would anybody on the planet want to live out here?
Well, some people crave a little adventure.
Plus, the real estate's cheap.
Oh. Make sense.
Luke? Luke Pakele?
Five-O. We need to talk.
Where is he running to?
Nice roping, cowgirl.
Not even my best time.
All right, Luke, come on. Talk to me.
You go from, uh, stealing cattle to killing cowboys?
What the hell are you talking about?
I never killed no cowboy.
Okay, well, look, I, uh...
I got, uh, one cowboy in the morgue,
and you're the only one with motive to put him there.
Keone's dead?
He was poisoned.
And you think I did it?
The guy got you fired.
Cost you a lot of money.
I imagine it made you pretty angry.
Yeah, I was pissed.
But I didn't off the guy.
Okay, then why'd you run when we showed up?
Pretty sure she's about to tell you.
So, this guy,
definitely making Santa's "Naughty" list.
Stanozolol, oxandrolone, andro.
This is not good, Luke.
Definitely enough steroids to put you away for a while.
I don't care about this, okay?
I really don't. I want... I want to know about the murder.
I told you, I didn't kill him.
Hold that thought.
All right, you ready for this?
We show up at Keone's place only to find out
somebody's already been here.
I got evidence of forced entry at the front door.
Inside the house, the place has been completely tossed,
and some stuff seems to be missing.
I spoke with the next door neighbor,
who said she walked by the place this morning.
Everything seemed normal.
So this break-in likely happened after the murder.
Okay, so Luke doses Keone,
and then he comes back to rob him
to make up for some of the money he lost.
That would be a viable theory,
except for a lot of the valuables are still here.
Now, I see that there's been a computer tower that's been stolen,
but they left behind a flat-screen and a stereo.
They also neglected to take a pretty nice camera,
though it does look like they swiped the memory card.
So it looks like they were after evidence of something.
Exactly.
I don't think this murder was about revenge at all.
Well, latest toxicology report is back.
And?
And you were wrong. Again.
Our mystery poison is not TCVP.
Aren't you done yet?
Oh, actually, I was, uh, texting Captain Grover to let him know,
based on my complete analysis of Keone Maka's stomach contents,
I was able to conclude that the yet-to-be-identified poison
was ingested in liquid form.
So he can instruct all the CSU
to ignore any solid foods in the house.
Wow. Case-breaking discovery.
Enjoy your digs, Doctor,
but I am going to be
the one riding off into the sunset with the win.
Well, at least I'll still have Janice.
You son of a bitch.
How dare you speak her name.
You stole her from me!
Oh, please, she was never yours to steal.
And why are you still angry?
I'm the one who should be angry.
What? What gives you the right to be angry?
Well, you told all our friends your side of the story,
painted me as a villain.
And then they all turned on me.
I became a pariah.
You betrayed my trust!
But for the record, I never told them to freeze you out.
No, but you let it happen.
I don't get it.
Why would this guy be keeping a vial of blood in his fridge?
I don't know, but he hid it.
Must mean it's important.
I really wonder
if it has something to do with his murder.
Uh, yeah, I hate to even say it,
but the way this case is going,
I don't know if we're gonna make it home
by Christmas morning.
Well, that's fantastic.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine. Couple days ago,
I overheard Grace talking to one of her friends,
and I think that the cat is officially out of the bag.
Cat's out of the bag?
Yeah.
You know, I never really got that one.
I mean, who puts a cat in a bag?
I don't know.
The point is, I-I think
that she no longer believes, in Santa Claus.
In fact, I'm pretty sure
she probably hasn't believed in him for a little while now.
It was inevitable, Danny.
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
But, you know, there's this very special look
that I get once a year.
You see, I get to see her come out of her room,
and she has this glow
when she sees those presents
that Santa left for her, and I-I just think
that Christmas is not gonna be the same without...
without it, so, there you go.
Maybe you're looking at it all wrong. I mean,
maybe it's not so bad.
How is it not so bad?
Well, because now, you don't have to keep up the charade.
Right? The ruse is over.
Look, there's no more lying, no more hiding the presents,
no more sneaking around, putting them under the tree.
And the best thing of all is, this year, for the first time,
you'll get all the credit for the awesome gifts.
Right?
I don't... I don't care about the credit,
though, you know?
Look, all I'm saying--
it's okay for a kid Grace's age
to not believe in old Saint Nick.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Maybe I'm just upset that she's growing up so fast.
Danny filled me in on the case earlier.
What's the latest?
Well, Hawaii PD located Keone Maka's truck
about a mile from the Mars training site.
Okay. It looks like he lost control and it went into a ravine.
You know, I'm thinking that the poison must have kicked in
while he was driving.
Well, it makes sense.
He gets disoriented, he, he crashes into the ditch,
and then he goes looking for help on foot.
Their CSU is processing it now.
Meantime, I think I might have a lead.
Oh, by the way, Pua stopped by.
He was looking for you and Danny.
He say why?
No, but he was acting weird.
Hey, what's up, cuz?
So, I pulled Keone's phone records,
and I found something interesting.
In the 48 hours before his death,
he exchanged nine phone calls with a man
from Los Angeles by the name of Jeff Harrison.
Now, right after the last call,
Harrison booked a flight from LA to Kona
that arrived at 1:00 a.m. this morning.
Okay, let me get this straight.
So, nine phone calls in two days.
Then the guy shows up,
and a couple hours later, Keone's dead?
What do we know about Harrison?
The guy's a horse trainer.
No record, but he did end up
in the news last year when his racehorse,
Urban Myth, went missing.
I remember this. Urban Myth.
He was a favorite to win the Kentucky Derby.
Night before the race, horse disappears.
Nobody ever heard anything, no ransom demand, nothing.
Guys, hold on a second.
I just got a hit back on Harrison's credit card.
Looks like he's staying at a motel in Hamakua,
and he just booked a return flight back to L.A.
That leaves in a few hours.
Well, he's gonna miss that flight.
Help!
Help me!
Help me! Help!
Detective Williams with Five-O.
I'm en route with a possible poison victim.
Early 60s, male.
ETA-- we're about three minutes out.
Need trauma team standing by.
Danny, he's not gonna make it.
All right, let's get him inside.
Start him on O2 and get a line in.
Do we know what kind of poison it was?
No. We got somebody working on it right now.
Well, tell them to work fast.
They need to I.D. that toxin
if we're gonna save this man's life.
Bag and tag anything Harrison could have ingested.
Toothpaste, mouthwash, gum, coffee grounds--
take it all.
Something in this room was laced with poison.
We need to find it!
Now!
Max.
Smell this.
It could be our delivery system.
Smells like liquid nicotine, right?
It's faint, but I concur.
We still need to run it to be sure.
Liquid nicotine would explain the pinpoints in the eyes.
And the mucus in the lungs.
And it wouldn't show up in the standard tox screen.
It's a good catch, Sanjeet.
Weird. It... it sounded like I just received a compliment,
but that's impossible since
you're the only other person in the room.
Sanjeet, about what happened...
I shouldn't have let our friends turn against you.
I didn't consider the consequences.
I'm sorry.
Accepted.
Boom. Liquid nicotine!
We were right.
No. You were right.
Make the call.
We treated Harrison with Atropine and Pralidoxime.
With some time to recover,
he should be fine, but he was lucky.
Liquid nicotine, highly concentrated,
is extremely toxic.
Just a teaspoon could be fatal.
And thanks to e-cigarettes, it's readily available.
Okay, uh, when can we speak to him?
Uh, not for a couple hours at least.
We had to sedate him.
But I'll let you know when he comes to.
Okay. Mahalo.
Lab report just came in
on that blood from Keone's house.
Horse blood.
They said it was drawn no more than a couple of days ago.
Okay, wait a minute.
Uh, Lou, do me a favor.
See if you can get in touch
with the American Thoroughbred Association.
All right? They should have DNA profiles
on all the professional race horses.
See if they can run that blood
against the profile of Urban Myth.
Okay. What are you thinking?
I'm thinking that this case
has something to do with that missing horse.
Just take your time.
Let me know if you recognize anyone.
Him... and him.
Are you sure, ma'am?
100%.
It was those two haoles.
Thank you.
Okay, thank you.
You were right. That was the ATA.
Blood from Keone's-- direct DNA match to Urban Myth.
Uh, okay.
That sample was taken a couple of days ago.
That means that horse is on this island.
Keone must have come into contact with him,
and then reached out to Harrison
to let him know he found his missing horse.
Harrison tells Keone
to get a blood sample so they can confirm.
And then whoever has Urban Myth
realizes that somebody's onto him,
and realizes he has to clip 'em both.
We got to figure out who's got that horse.
Okay, thing I don't get is this.
Why would you steal a racehorse and not ransom it?
I mean, it's not like you can run it anywhere.
No.
But you could put it out to stud, make a lot of money.
Okay, so we checked,
and there are only three stud farms on the entire island.
But one of them, Nakata Ranch,
was right on Keone's delivery route.
That must be where he saw Urban Myth.
Okay, what do we know about this place?
Owner's name is Al Mokuau.
That's the guy from the rodeo.
That's the same guy who tried to
pin this whole thing on Luke Pakele.
I say we round him up.
What was that, a horse metaphor?
Yes, sir.
Hey. Where's Mokuau?
Took off about an hour ago.
Where's Urban Myth?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Your boss-- where was he headed?
I'm not sure. He was in a pickup,
with a horse trailer hitched to the back.
He's getting rid of the evidence.
Guys, I tried pinging Mokuau's cell phone,
but I'm not getting a signal.
Think I might know where he is.
HPD just ran Mokuau's financials.
Yesterday he rented a backhoe from
a local construction supply company.
This morning, he had it delivered to a property
he owns in Waimea.
He's going to kill and bury that horse.
Let's go.
Don't move.
It's all right. Easy, boy. You're all right.
Turn around.
Give me your hands.
Can't even move my arm. I need an ambulance.
Yeah? Well, I'd call you one,
but, you know, the service out here is terrible.
How about you, sis, you got anything?
Half a bar.
I could bleed to death.
Yeah, you could.
And after all you've done, that's a real consideration.
Wha... All you got on me
is stolen property
and maybe attempted animal cruelty.
That's where you're wrong.
On the way over here, we got a phone call.
Local crime lab-- seems they found a travel mug
inside Keone's truck.
Still had some coffee in it.
So they tested the mug and the coffee,
and guess what they found.
Traces of liquid nicotine.
So now we're thinking that he got dosed
when he came by your ranch this morning.
Lab also found a fingerprint on the mug.
And I'm guessing, once you give us yours, it'll match.
It was a gutsy play. You know, you steal Urban Myth,
bringing him way out here, putting him out to stud.
I think it probably would have worked
if Keone had not recognized this horse.
He was gonna blow the whistle on you.
And somehow you got wind of it.
And you took him out before he had a chance to.
And then you went over to his place
and discovered he'd already contacted Harrison.
So now Harrison had to go, too.
Keone always went on about how much he loved horse racing.
I saw him on my security feed.
sneaking around, taking pictures of him...
I knew he recognize Urban Myth.
Why couldn't he just leave well enough alone?
No one was looking for that horse anymore.
Urban Myth got to retire to a big ranch.
While the owners got their insurance payout.
Everyone had moved on.
No one cared.
Except Keone.
Urban Myth was just a foal
when I started working with him.
I've trained a lot of horses over the years, but...
Urban...
Well, let's just say that
some mean more to you.
Hey, boy.
How come you automatically sit in the front?
Well, look, hold on, it's not automatic.
First of all, I said shotgun. Second of all,
if you're gonna make a thing about it,
I'll sit in the back. I'm being polite.
You can't... You're sitting there last night,
I got to fold myself up like a pretzel...
Hold on, wait.
Hold on.
Just a moment.
Here we go-- round 15.
Don't ask.
Wait, just a moment.
I, uh, just wanted to thank...
Max for his, uh...
his assistance on this case.
Your skills as a wingman are unparalleled.
Happy to assist, Sanjeet.
Hey, you know, us working together--
it's given me the opportunity to...
make things right between us.
Merry Christmas.
Wait. Is that...
You two belong together.
Gentlemen, behold
an original limited edition 1974
Yeoman Janice Rand action figure.
So this beef
between you two this whole time has been about a, um...
a Barbie doll?
It's an action figure.
Ah. Okay, I'm done.
Nice to meet you.
You see, for many years,
I had been collecting the original
Star Trek T.O.S. action figures.
And Janice would have completed my collection.
And, you know, swiped him in an internet auction.
I should have been the bigger man, but, you know,
I had a thing for the actress, and in this instance,
I kind of felt Max should have,
you know, stepped aside, but...
It's fine.
You do have a point. I mean...
Look, if-if you wanted her back,
No.
I'd understand.
No, no, I insist.
You should have her.
But...
It's meant to be.
You know, um, this is all very touching,
but, uh, we really have to go.
Dr. Dhawan, thanks for your help.
We couldn't have done it without you.
Thank you, Captain Grover.
I have been,
and always shall be,
your friend.
Live long and prosper.
Live long and prosper, Max.
Trust me.
Why do you only have one Christmas album?
I don't know, it's Andy Williams.
What else do you need?
Wait, hang on, there, chief.
How about Bing Crosby?
How about a little Nat King Cole?
Hey, Dean Martin's "A Winter Romance" is a good one.
I don't have them. I apologize.
If we need additional musical accompaniment,
I'd be happy to go home and fetch my keyboard.
I could get my trumpet.
This'll burn the house down,
you spill this thing, man.
Where's the tea?
The what?
I need tea and honey.
We been caroling all day.
Pipes are sore, brah.
Kitchen.
Mele Kalikimaka.
What do you think?
Beautiful, right?
I love it.
Good.
What's wrong, Danno?
What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. What do you mean?
I got everything I want for Christmas-- I got you,
and I got this beautiful tree. Come here.
Hey, what's going on?
Mele Kalikimaka, Detective Williams.
What's this?
A citation.
You and Commander McGarrett stole a pine tree
from a protected reserve.
I have the evidence to prove it,
and I also have a witness.
What is this, huh? $1,200?
That's the mandatory fine.
And I have to confiscate the tree.
You're gonna take... Are you serious?
I'm afraid so.
Tonight. It's Christmas Eve. You're gonna take my tree?
Hi, Pua. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Pua.
How's it, Pua?
Well...
You know, maybe I can take it back tomorrow.
Okay. Come in. You want an eggnog?
Okay? Come on, come on.
Why not? My shift's almost over.
Come on, everybody, gather around.
All right, here we go.
*Silent night*
*Holy night*
*All is calm*
*All is bright*
*Sleep in heavenly peace*
