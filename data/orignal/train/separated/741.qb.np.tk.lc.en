but , winston , you got to climb aboard , man .

yeah .
dude , it &apos;s a temp job .
if by &quot; serious , &quot; you mean &quot; piece of crap , &quot;
then yeah , it &apos;s serious .
i &apos;m surprised you haven &apos;t made a game of it .
oh , i &apos;ve tried .
i &apos;m losing my mind , guys .
you know , i sometimes touch the frayed part
of the power cord just to feel something .
what &apos;s up , guys ?
nobody has any lady guests coming over tonight , right ?
lady guests ?
and how do you feel
about opening your home and your hearts
to the youth of america ?
yo , miss day , where should we set up these bells ?
第一季 第七集
i &apos;m so sorry , you guys , i should have told you ,
but the community center decided
to turn our rehearsal space back into a hallway , so ...
i had nowhere to go .
is this something that a mean , creative judge made you do ?
yeah , this is just like a nightmare i had where you brought over
teenagers with bells .
these kids had a choice between early morning detention and music ,
and they all chose music .
no kidding ?
desiree , bells are not for hitting .
the kids wanted to play band instruments ,
but we got a huge donation of handbells ,
which are tres tres dope .
miss day ,
can i eat some of these crackers up in here ?
no , no , no . water crackers are for adults ...
to eat with adult cheese .
can i eat a cracker sushi sandwich ?
no . jess .
so what , you guys
are gonna sit around all night playing &quot; jingle bells &quot; ?
&quot; jingle bells &quot; is a trash song
played on a trash instrument ,
and i &apos;m not really asking permission ,
i &apos;m giving you a heads @-@ up .
well , that got serious .
anyway , you are gonna love these kids .
thank you , schmidt .
wonderful .
great , guys !
so good .
just think , you could be in detention right now .
is it too late to choose detention ?
we suck .
we don &apos;t suck , we just need a little bit of rehearsal .
hector , okay , good !
big finish ,
and ... we &apos;re out .
i &apos;m so proud of you .
that &apos;s what it feels like to play a song
sort of together .
bring it in .
in .
yes .
ensembell !
ensembell !
five minutes of text time-- you earned it .
oh , dear ... miss day !
desiree ?
miss day !
you got a twisted toilet , miss day .
nick ! toilet situation ! code one ! water only !
you didn &apos;t tell her the system ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry , she went rogue .
you have to turn on the faucet
before you flush the toil , , &apos; cause ...
all right .
thank you , nick .
all right .
there we go , no problem .
perfect . you did it .
the plastic soda bottle is right were it &apos;s supposed to be--
back in the wall hole .
what ? it &apos;s fixed .
i &apos;ve heard that before .
it &apos;s fixed .
it &apos;s fixed .
it &apos;s fixed .
okay , nick , repeat after me :
i am not the chinese kid from goonies .
you know , i fix things just to the point of working , schmidt .
if you want a fancy @-@ fix , just say so .
okay .
please fancy @-@ fix the toilet .
that &apos;s all you had to say .
that actually sounds really good .
you &apos;re amazing !
goose pimples .
look . each one ...
a memory .
winston , please help me . just hear me out .
two things women love--
alternative percussion players and role models .
the kids would love it and we &apos;d get to spend time together .
you got to do it-- it &apos;s a mitzvah , bro .
are you sure you &apos;ve never rung before ? believe it or not , jess ,
i have never played handbells before .
i just pick things up easy , that &apos;s all .
i know handbells aren &apos;t the coolest instrument in the world ,
they might not even be the fifth coolest ,
but the kids would love it , it would really
mean a lot to them , and if they saw how good you are ,
i think they &apos;d really get into it
and maybe try a little bit harder .
also , there &apos;s , like , a lot of potentially cool
like , bell shorthand we could use to talk about ...
nick ... while he &apos;s right there we &apos;ll be , like ...
&quot; nick &apos;s such a tinkle ! &quot;
&quot; i think he &apos;s more like a tonkel . &quot;
tinkle and tonkel are potential
bell talk we could use .
i get it .
just be cool , please .
i am cool .
before you make your decision ,
i &apos;d only need you till the concert on sunday .
i don &apos;t know , i think i could be into this .
yay !
and with that statement , he never had sex again .
winston and me are playing bells every day ...
until sunday . i &apos;m cool .
nick , look , i don &apos;t mean to nag you ,
but how long is this gonna take ?
fancy @-@ fix , fancy amount of time .
&apos;cause i would like to use my own bathroom now .
sir , bathrooms are for customers only .
how dare you .
if only there were some sort of pipe and ...
and water expert that we could hire
to come and fix this problem .
yeah , i can &apos;t afford a plumber .
a plumber !
that &apos;s what it &apos;s called !
you really want to do this ?
you want to have this fight with me ?
you want to go down this path , smimidt ?
i don &apos;t know , is this a path that you recently fixed ?
it &apos;s called self @-@ reliance .
&apos;cause unlike you , schmidt ,
i don &apos;t just throw my money at problems .
all i &apos;m hearing is that i can &apos;t use my bathroom because you &apos;re poor .
look , it &apos;s your lucky day , buddy .
i &apos;m gonna pay for the plumber .
no , schmidt , i don &apos;t want your charity .
well , you seem very happy using my emergency tools .
oh , yeah ? do you even know what this is ?
doy , it &apos;s a scissor .
yeah , that &apos;s exactly right .
a scissor . really , schmidt ?
yeah , a scissors that you just threw in the turdlet .
so , tonight at rehearsal , keep an eye out for hector .
i &apos;m having trouble getting him to interact .
he really wants to play the drums , so i told him
bells were the next best thing , which was a lie ,
so i couldn &apos;t keep a straight face while i was saying it .
he saw right through me .
so , why do you do this bell thing , jess ?
i mean , like , how do you win ?
you don &apos;t win . you win by helping the kids .
i just want to get them to care and try hard , you know ?
so you want them to try hard ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll get them t try hard .
no , i &apos;m telling you , they &apos;re not gonna listen to you .
okay .
oh , what , a plumber ?
you plan it this way ?
just to rub my face in it ?
yes ,
i wanted to rub your face in our working toilet .
great . well , that working toilet i will never use .
you &apos;re never gonna go to the bathroom again ?
oh , you &apos;re the soda bottle guy .
yeah .
that was actually pretty smart .
thank you ! thank you .
and i have nothing to say to you .
okay .
question for you , sir . how much did he pay for this ?
all right , you know what ? that &apos;s enough .
$ 50 ? $ 100 ?
inappropriate .
hey , my name &apos;s schmidt . i was born rich .
i had a $ 40,000 bar mitzvah .
okay .
how long you do the petty act for , man , huh ?
a week ? a month ?
is this &quot; my favorite bedspread &quot; all over again ?
that was a handmade gift my nanny gave me
that you spilled a pitcher of midori sours on ,
and now you bring it up like it &apos;s nothing ?
i left you a check for $ 30 on your pillow .
your nanny gave you that thing for free ,
so as far as i &apos;m concerned , you &apos;re up 30 bucks .
my nanny is dead !
i &apos;m not looking to make money off of her !
i will not apologize again for the midori sours !
who drinks midori sours ? !
everyone drinks midori sours !
no , they don &apos;t !
it &apos;s a melon liqueur !
i would never drink one !
it &apos;s an american
classic with asian influences !
winston would never drink one !
enjoy the couch . i bought that , too .
enjoy the rug , too-- paid for that .
organic woven .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ? oh , come on , man .
well , i stole the cable !
and my bar mitzvah was an amazing event !
the theme was sports jams .
oh ! wow ! oh , my god ! that was really good .
that was amazing . wow !
that was off the hammer !
the hammer in the bell .
tough crowd .
here &apos;s what i was thinking , okay ?
if we want to win this concert ,
we play something cool , like &quot; eye of the tiger . &quot;
what &apos;s &quot; eye of the tiger &quot; ?
&quot; eye of the tiger &quot; is the greatest song ever written .
it &apos;s so cool , it ended the cold war .
that &apos;s not even a little bit true .
i never thought bells could be cool .
what do you mean ? i make bells cool .
do that thing where you hold three bells in one hand ...
three @-@ in @-@ hand .
i think she &apos;s talking about the winston .
yeah . the winston .
it &apos;s actually called the three @-@ in @-@ hand .
i can do it .
yeah , but can you do this ?
oh , my god !
that was really pretty .
but miss day has a few tricks
up her sleeves as well .
let &apos;s see what you got .
yeah , come on , miss day .
let &apos;s see what you got , miss day , come on .
i am a robot
trying to play the bells .
don &apos;t judge me ,
&apos;cause i can &apos;t think at all ,
i just like to play the bells .
i want to play &quot; eye of the tiger . &quot;
yeah , come on , &quot; tiger &quot; !
yeah , please !
i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t know .
that sounds so fun , but we can &apos;t ,
because we don &apos;t have time .
oh , darn !
here &apos;s what i was thinking .
if you skip school and practice , then , boom , you got it .
mr. bishop .
yeah , yeah . done .
what &apos;s the deal with winston ? he &apos;s really intense .
oh , look , i grew up with winston .
i know how he is .
he &apos;s incredibly talented ,
but he &apos;s a jerk about it .
yeah , he &apos;s one of those guys
that he &apos;ll never pass the ball if he thinks he can score .
i just don &apos;t know why it needs to be a competition .
that &apos;s just the way some guys are , jess , you know ?
they get themselves wrapped up in these insecure , silly games .
hey , nick ,
uh , we &apos;re good with that whole plumber thing , right ?
absolutely .
yeah , okay , cool , &apos; cause ...
&apos;cause i was right about that whole thing .
yeah , i unfixed that .
well , how you gonna unfix a dead schmidt ? !
i &apos;m not worried about it ! i knew you &apos;re gonna put it together .
you &apos;re so predictable , schmidt !
stop yelling .
i don &apos;t want to hear you yelling anymore .
what ... ?
i paid for the freezer , so , you know .
i &apos;m gonna kill you .
that &apos;s a , that &apos;s a b right there .
get that in there .
you &apos;re fired .
focus .
are you focused ?
okay , what &apos;s the song about ?
hector ?
hanging tough . staying hungry .
a man and his will to survive .
are you brown @-@ nosing me ?
yes , i am .
you &apos;re so cool .
where are your eyes ?
on the tiger .
one , two , three , four .
two , three , four .
no , no no no , no no no !
are you kidding me ?
it is nothing that hard , people .
it is an insumument that a cat wears around its neck .
okay , you know what , i think they did a pretty great job ,
considering the fact that they &apos;ve only played it , like , eight times .
well you &apos;re wrong , okay ? you thought wrong , jess .
you know why ? because i &apos;m out there
right by mysyself in the cold . i got no support .
maybe we &apos;re just not good enough .
no , you &apos;re good enough .
this is not your problem , this is mr. bishop &apos;s problem .
rest .
rest .
rest .
rest .
can you hear it ? it &apos;s a very famous song .
mr. bishop ...
i &apos;ll tell you what .
here . here .
you &apos;re gonna play these , okay ?
play these until you figure it out .
right ? don &apos;t play these .
and what are you laughing at , wnba ?
this is what you look like .
you look like you &apos;re fighting off a shark .
okay , this is what i want .
mr. bishop !
petting a dolphin . oh , yeah , there we go .
all right , and you ...
you didn &apos;t make me want to throw up .

i &apos;m gonna make you guys a pitcher
of my famous virgin sangria .
isn &apos;t that just juice ?
this has to stop !
it &apos;s not my war !
hey , uh , maybe jess is right .
maybe we should talk this thing through .
absolutely , man .
yeah ?
yeah .
all right , i &apos;m gonna put a clean shirt on .
great , man .
what is that , man ?
i &apos;m sorry . i put your couch
and your freezer in your room , schmidt .
yeah , i didn &apos;t want to get my poor on them .
i got to get in there , man . i &apos;m a mess .
i have to go to a networking event later .
scott caan is speaking !
ugh , would you listen to yourself ?

what ? no .
no , i can tell , man .
what are you doing ?
lotusberry relax . lotusberry relax .
i can smell it on you right now !
fine ! stop smelling my hair !
you know how much that stuff costs ?
okay , schmidt , i didn &apos;t use your conditioner .
why does your hair look so baby soft ? !
fine , schmidt !
i ran out of shampoo and i used your conditioner .
we &apos;re talking about conditioner , right ?
you used it as shampoo ? !
it &apos;s for moisture , nick ,
not for cleaning !
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re friends . give me it back , man .
give you what back ?
give me it back .
think about what you &apos;re doing right now .
i &apos;m squeezing it out of your hair .
you &apos;re squeezing it out of my hair ?
yes , i am .

okay , yeah .
it &apos;s on .
it &apos;s on . it &apos;s happening .
oh , it is ?
yeah , it is happening .
oh , you want-- okay , it is .
these are the first moments of what is happening right now .
this is the beginning of what &apos;s happening right now !
want to get your hands dirty ?
yeah , man .
whoa !
come on , schmidt !
you little rich boy sissy !
come on ! who you gonna hire to fight me , boy ? !
stop running !
stop running , schmidt !
you want it so bad , you got it !
okay !
enough !
where is this coming from , man ?
look , you chose to be a bartender .
you chose to drop out of law school .
you &apos;re not some down @-@ on @-@ your @-@ luck hardscrabble guy ,
you &apos;re just a loser who ...
i didn &apos;t mean ...
it &apos;s fine , man .
okay .
whatever , whatever , whatever , man .
just , these are the things that come out , man ,
when you take another man &apos;s conditioner .
winston , we need to talk .
we had a dress rehearsal .
it was horrible .
stop it !
hey !
those are expensive !
hector ! hector !
i &apos;m sorry , jess , but i really don &apos;t care .
you know what , i love running this group .
it gives me confidence ,
it gives me muscle definition .
yes , sometimes it gives me blinding optical migraines
where i literally can &apos;t see three feet in front of myself .
but i love these kids .
and i &apos;m sorry i kicked you out of group ,
but one thing you can &apos;t do with these kids
is make it about you .
jess , i don &apos;t see what the big deal is , okay ?
i only practiced with you guys a couple of times .
you &apos;re such a tonkel !
whoa , hold it !
don &apos;t nobody call me a tonkel .
if you tell them they aren &apos;t good ,
that &apos;s one more person telling them that .
that &apos;s a big deal to me ,
making sure no one else gives up on them .
even if they sound like
a guy covered in bells falling down a staircase
that &apos;s also made of bells .
i know you &apos;ve had a hard month , i know you don &apos;t have a job ,
but , god , they &apos;re just kids .
also , what happened to the refrigerator and the sofa ?
did we get robbed by giants ?
you know what sucks about getting older ?
your friends have known you for way too long .
they &apos;ve got too much on you .
yep .
i want friends who still lie to me ,
&apos;cause they don &apos;t want to hurt my feelings .
i sadly kind of mean that .
what happened to us , man ?
we used to be so cool .
i was going to play basketball and be a gazillionaire .
right . and i told myself
i was never going to live with schmidt .
who do you live with now ?
i live with schmidt ,
and he &apos;s killing me ,
winston , he &apos;s killing me .
i got fired from a temp job .
yeah , i got kicked out of bell group for being too mean to kids .
yeah , i &apos;ve been meaning to talk to you about that .
that &apos;s a low point . you ain &apos;t got to talk to me , i know it .
i know it , man .
but i was just enjoying
being good at something .
i mean , what does she want me to do ,
not care about what the songs sound like ?
winston , this is your thing though .
it &apos;s not always about being the best .
it &apos;s not always about you , winston .
this is about kids .
just pass the ball .
i &apos;ll drive , pal .
want to go to this bells concert ?
let me get my cardigan .
i know you guys are nervous . i know you want to do a really great job
and you want to sound really great , but it &apos;s not about that .
there &apos;s a really big crowd of people
who &apos;s really excited and wants to hear some bells today .
just look .
all right , bring it in .
hello , pershing park !
we are ...
ensembell .
what ? what &apos;d you say ?
i said , um--
she said ensembell !
it &apos;s on the banner , stupid !
but first , i &apos;d like to welcome
winston bishop to the stage .
hey , what &apos;s a winston bishop ?
hey .
what &apos;s up ?
&quot; eye the tiger &quot; ?
yo , hector , you think we can pull this off ?
probably not .
yeah , i don &apos;t think so , either .
so let &apos;s do it .
one , two , three , four .
you know i don &apos;t think you &apos;re a loser , right ?
i can &apos;t hear anything you say
when you wear that sweater , schmidt .
you open your mouth and i just hear : &quot; cardigan , cardigan .
i am wearing a cardigan . &quot;
this is super embarrassing .
yeah , it &apos;s terrible .
it &apos;s the eye of the tiger , it &apos;s the thrill of the fight .
rising , watching us all with the eye ...
