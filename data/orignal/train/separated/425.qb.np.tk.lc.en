emily , this call for you from a sean mcallister .
came to my phone accidentally . it sounded very important .
sean .
i was gonna call you back . i just--i got busy on a case .
ian doyle vanished from prison .
interpol can &apos;t find him .
am i in danger ?
we all are .
sean thinks we &apos;re all in danger .
but i was the only one who had any personal connection to him .
as far as doyle is concerned ,
lauren reynolds died in a car accident .
you died and we &apos;re all good .
i want to hear you say it .
lauren reynolds is dead .
bye .
who &apos;s lauren reynolds ?
i want to talk to sean .
they got her .
drop the phone . get on the ground , now .
tsia ?
he &apos;s gone .
jeremy &apos;s dead .
how long have we been talking ?
you &apos;ve gotta get out of there .
oh , god .
it &apos;s doyle , isn &apos;t it ?
toss that cell phone and get home safely .
prentiss , what &apos;s going on with you ?
i &apos;ve been watching you the last couple of days
and something is obviously bothering you .
derek , because i like you ,
i &apos;m going to ask you not to do this .
i was beginning to think you weren &apos;t coming .
after what happened to jeremy , i was afraid .
tsia , i &apos;m sorry you can &apos;t be at his funeral .
it &apos;s today , isn &apos;t it ?
well , that &apos;s the problem
with marrying a member from your own team .
one of you is a target , so is the other . i get it .
hello , darling .
all right , let &apos;s make this quick . i took a late lunch .
how many times do i have to tell you ?
i &apos;m not quick about anything .
i don &apos;t know .
what about that time i blew my cover in prague ?
you took out that sentry before i could even draw my weapon .
you saved my ass , clyde .
i &apos;m surprised you remember
the little people from your interpol days
now that you &apos;re a posh fbi profiler .
what &apos;s being done to locate doyle ?
only every agency in the northern hemisphere is looking for him .
what are we doing to find him ?
my contact at dcri tracked one of doyle &apos;s aliases
leaving france the day after jeremy &apos;s murder .
he took a commercial flight to beijing ,
then doubled back on a train bound for berlin .
but when gsg 9 intercepted it ,
he was already gone .
he sent me flowers ,
so i think it &apos;s safe to assume he &apos;s coming here .
why is he doing this ?
why do you think ? we put him away .
duty calls ?
i know what you &apos;re thinking .
absolutely not .
your team isn &apos;t under oath .
they don &apos;t have clearance .
they could help .
how ?
we don &apos;t even know where doyle is .
involving them at this point would be premature .
and reckless . leave it to tsia and i.
you go be with your team .
even in hiding
doyle can &apos;t resist extravagance .
track the money .
i will find him , darling .
trust me .
i don &apos;t trust anyone anymore .
traffic . i &apos;m sorry . let &apos;s get started .
ok . 10 @-@ year @-@ old sammy sparks of lafayette parish , louisiana ,
showed up at his elementary school this morning covered in blood .
when police got to his house ,
they found that his parents ,
charlie and alison sparks , were missing .
well , forensics indicate that at least one of them was injured ,
and by the looks of it , it was pretty severely .
has there been a ransom demand ?
there &apos;s been no communication whatsoever .
then why call in the bau ?
new orleans is hoping we can interview sammy .
no one &apos;s talked to the witness yet ?
i don &apos;t understand .
if sammy was covered with blood ,
there &apos;s a good chance he could identify the unsub .
sammy &apos;s autistic .
getting him to tell us what happened isn &apos;t gonna be easy .
&quot; tomorrow , you promise yourself , will be different , &quot;
&quot; yet tomorrow is too often a repetition of today . &quot;
author james t. mccay .
is that the one where they fly around in the phone booth ?
first of all , it &apos;s a police box , not a phone booth .
second of all , dr. who started a quarter of a century
before bill and ted even went on their bodacious adventure ,
so , really , they should have just call it
&quot; bill and ted &apos;s excellent rip @-@ off . &quot;
i mean , at least then--
i &apos;m really sorry .
for what ?
asking .
good morning , angels . new information to report .
the blood at the crime scene matched type to charlie sparks ,
so we can assume that he is the injured party .
well , shell casings by the door says he was shot .
are we looking at a robbery gone wrong ?
no robber would break into a family residence
before the start of school and not expect to find people home .
no , i think he came for
charlie and alison sparks .
he planned the abduction and then gained entry to the house .
but the scene is frenzied , disorganized .
he didn &apos;t think it through .
i hate to say it , but could sammy be our unsub ?
i don &apos;t think so .
what &apos;s the number one motive of kidnapping ?
financial gain .
yeah , well , if that &apos;s the case ,
they are barking up the wrong money tree .
the family runs a music store that &apos;s been sparks owned
since the 1940s ,
but business is down
and a loan against the house
is the only thing keeping that store afloat .
the unsub should have done his research .
well , he may have .
this area was devastated by the oil spill .
a little bit of money would go a long way here .
first impression-- this is a man on a mission .
he didn &apos;t steal a single expensive item
from either one of these rooms .
he definitely came for the parents .
no sign of forced entry .
the sparks most likely recognized him , hotch .
unless the door was unlocked .
i highly doubt that .
look at the blood pattern .
charlie was shot as he was moving towards the door .
well , how you figure that ?
because of the pools of blood .
they &apos;re separated by distant steps .
which means he had to be moving quickly , so he was running .
and the closer you get to the door , the more blood there is .
so he was shot right here ,
reached for his wound instinctively ,
and then tried to grab the piano to break his fall .
see , the handprint is facing upwards , toward the door ,
the same way he was facing when he was shot .
alison was interrupted while she was making
sammy &apos;s lunch in the kitchen .
because she heard the doorbell ring .
so she approaches the door ,
opens it only to find a gun aimed at her face .
so she screams .
that brings charlie running down the stairs trying to help ,
but the unsub shoots charlie because he won &apos;t back off .
charlie &apos;s severely wounded .
why does the unsub take the time to drag him out of the house
knowing that he &apos;s leaving a 10 @-@ year @-@ old witness home alone ?
the unsub must have known the family well enough
to realize that sammy would never be capable of i.d.ing him .
hi , sammy .
i &apos;m dr. spencer reid .
what are you drawing ?
oh , god !
some autistic children don &apos;t handle touch well .
it &apos;s possible that witnessing his parents &apos; abduction
pushed him into emotional overload and he shut down .
look at that .
is he trying to tell us something ?
sammy .
we &apos;re looking for your mom and your dad .
did &quot; l &quot; take them ?
garcia ...
yes , sir .
i need you to run a list
of all known associates to the sparks family ,
focusing on everyone whose first or last name
begins with the letter &quot; l. &quot;
well , it looks like they were open
to alternative methods of payment .
there &apos;s some construction work for a child &apos;s drum set
and cleaning services for sheet music .
bartering must be popular in a cash @-@ strapped area like this .
they have video surveillance , which is good news .
do you think the unsub was here ?
it &apos;s possible .
these guys like to scout their targets prior to abduction .
they get off on the fact the victims never see them coming .
there &apos;s a lot they don &apos;t teach us at the academy .
experience handles the rest .
let &apos;s get these tapes to garcia .
well , the kid definitely likes to draw ,
but i can &apos;t quite figure out what it is he &apos;s drawing .
that &apos;s a dog .
how can you possibly know that that looks like a dog ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe a dad knows .
well , i didn &apos;t see a dog outside . did you ?
they use these for occupational therapy , but they &apos;re soft .
those things are expensive , too .
that &apos;s a favorite .
i think we should get this to reid .
he may be able to use it to connect with sammy .
look at these drawings .
this must be sammy &apos;s desk .
alison and charlie really went out of their way
to accommodate sammy &apos;s condition .
he must have come here after school every day .
so he was a fixture .
not just in the store but in the community .
it &apos;s no wonder the sparks had to take out a loan .
they put all of their money into helping their son .
such dedicated parents .
what happens to sammy if we can &apos;t find them ?
garcia &apos;s searching for relatives now .
if she can &apos;t find anyone ,
then he will be turned over to the state ,
and he &apos;ll be placed in a special needs foster facility .
let &apos;s make sure that doesn &apos;t happen .
we don &apos;t really have special resources
to accommodate children like sammy ,
so he &apos;s in with everybody else .
can he comprehend the material ?
not everything .
you know , i &apos;ve done my best
to research alternative teaching methods ,
but there &apos;s only so much i can do .
children with autism normally think very logically .
their minds can pick up patterns
that ours normally wouldn &apos;t recognize .
hmm . yes , that &apos;s right . i &apos;ve found that repetition and routine
are the keys to getting through to him .
you know , that makes sense .
repetition forms patterns on the brain ,
and as those patterns reoccur ,
it forms a calming influence on the child .
which would allow new information to be retained .
i &apos;m sure sammy &apos;s parents figured that out , too .
his parents most likely kept him on a strict daily schedule .
oh , like clockwork .
that &apos;s how sammy was able to walk
from his house to school yesterday .
he &apos;d memorized the route .
yeah , it &apos;s 7 : 45 , time for him to go to school .
he doesn &apos;t need to wait for his mom or dad .
he simply grabs an empty lunchbox and heads here .
if sammy was living on a strict routine ,
that means charlie and alison were , too .
which would have only made them easier targets .
i &apos;m not sure how we &apos;re going to get through to him .
sammy &apos;s teacher says he &apos;s never even been able
to return his own mother &apos;s hug .
garcia , what have you got ?
on , i wish i could be more help .
if this is about money , it would be a hell of a lot easier
for me to give you a list of people who wouldn &apos;t need it ,
and i &apos;d probably save a forest in the process .
due to the spill , fisherman and fishing @-@ related industries
have been hit the worst .
sheriff , was it common knowledge
that the sparks had gotten this loan ?
i knew . a loan around here is like winning the lottery .
so why no ransom note ?
maybe the unsub thinks he can get the money
directly from the source , cut out the middleman .
you think he &apos;ll use one of the parents as leverage
to get the other to clear out their accounts .
he &apos;s already shot charlie .
it shouldn &apos;t be that hard to manipulate alison into doing
what he wants if he offers medical assistance in exchange .
i think he just did .
what have you got ?
i froze the sparks &apos; assets earlier today ,
but someone at the bayside branch one parish over
just managed to withdraw $ 10,000
from their joint savings account .
call the branch . it they &apos;re still there , don &apos;t let them leave .
yeah . we &apos;re probably too late .
if the unsub has what he &apos;s after ,
sammy &apos;s parents just became expendable .
well , did you get it ?
i couldn &apos;t get you everything .
how much you get ?
10,000 .
what ? 10,000 ?
that &apos;s not enough .
i did exactly what you said . i didn &apos;t say anything .
please , i need to get back to sammy .
god knows where he is right now .
i can &apos;t do that , ali .
and charlie . charlie &apos;s hurt . he needs a doctor .
no , what he needs is a wife who pays better attention .
i &apos;ll never tell you where charlie is
if you don &apos;t get my money .
you said that if i got you--
shut up !
or we &apos;re gonna sit here while charlie bleeds to death ,
and you &apos;re never gonna see sammy again .
the account was frozen .
how did she take the money out ?
we &apos;re on an old system .
it only updates every night at midnight .
ok . how much did she want ?
well , she wanted to close out her account ,
but i told her i wouldn &apos;t be able to give her everything today .
we can &apos;t afford it .
how much is everything ?
$ 42,176.41 .
and the bank does not have that on site ?
not anymore .
mrs. sparks isn &apos;t the first customer
to consider closing her accounts .
could we take a look at the security footage you have ?
no sign of the unsub .
she doesn &apos;t look over her shoulder .
she doesn &apos;t try to warn you or anyone else in the bank ?
no .
what did she say to you when you told her
you couldn &apos;t give her all the money ?
i told her i could get her 10,000 now
and the rest in 2 days ,
but she became hysterical and kept saying that
that &apos;s not enough .
did she tell you what the money was for ?
she just asked for what she could get and she left .
the unsub is probably holding charlie at a secondary location .
which means he might still be alive .
i have run every &quot; l &quot; i can find , think of ,
or make up in my giant magic head and nothing hits .
i even ran the number 50 in case sammy has
some sort of predilection to roman numerals . came up dry .
any luck on finding sammy &apos;s next of kin ?
in name only . charlie has a sister
named elizabeth that was last reported
residing in mont belvieu , tejas .
but she &apos;s not responding to calls or email .
elizabeth . the &quot; l &quot; could stand for liz or lizzie .
garcia , we need to find her and fast .
i will move so fast , the earth will reverse its rotation
and time bend backwards . hello .
all right , so this unsub has the money he needs .
why hasn &apos;t he let the sparks go ?
he has to be holding them for a reason .
we might have an answer to that .
alison tried to withdraw $ 40,000 from the branch in bayside ,
but she only got 10,000 .
so maybe he &apos;s holding them until he gets the money he needs .
i think it &apos;s more than that . i think he wants a specific amount .
alison kept telling the bank manager that 10 grand wasn &apos;t enough .
that says to me he &apos;s told them what would be .
we believe the man you are looking for
is in danger of losing a home , property , or a business .
that &apos;s most of the area .
we want to focus on residents with large families ,
single @-@ income households ,
anyone with a financial responsibility for others .
that responsibility is probably what drove the unsub into action .
now , he had no intention of hurting either of his victims .
for him , the abduction of charlie and alison sparks
was an unfortunate but necessary means ot an end .
this area has been ravaged by last summer &apos;s oil spill .
so look for down @-@ and @-@ out fishermen ,
look for boat owners ,
or anyone who used to work in the tourist or beach industries .
and compare that list to people working part @-@ time
or under @-@ the @-@ table jobs .
this unsub didn &apos;t start with extortion , he was pushed there .
this man feels such a strong obligation to his dependents
that he &apos;s willing to kidnap and steal from people he knows .
he may be in the process of losing someone close to him
or has already .
look at recent divorce filings , child custody cases .
the unsub went to a bank in the next parish .
that tells us he has his own mode of transportation ,
and he is conscious of the fbi &apos;s involvement in this case .
by now he realizes the sparks &apos; accounts are frozen ,
so he &apos;ll be seeking alternative ways
to get the rest of the money he needs .
so canvass banks , pawnshops ,
anyplace that offers quick cash with minimal questions .
thank you very much .
oh , he &apos;s been busy .
what are those ?
we have no idea .
we &apos;re trying to find his aunt right now ,
but we &apos;re hoping that maybe in the meantime
you &apos;d be able to help us get through to him .
ok , i &apos;ll try , but even before this happened ,
sammy wasn &apos;t wildabout talking .
what &apos;s that ?
these help some kids with autism learn routines .
school bus leaves at 2 : 15 .
sammy , what &apos;s this ?
ok , ok .
do you have any idea what that &quot; l &quot; might stand for ?
i have no idea . sammy .
sammy , you &apos;re safe . it &apos;s me , ms. rogers .
i &apos;m here . i &apos;m here , sammy . you &apos;re safe .
sammy .
sammy .
i &apos;ve never seen that . i don &apos;t know what it is .
is he trying to type ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i think he &apos;s trying to play something .
can we get a keyboard in here ?
there &apos;s a piano at his house .
you want to take a 10 @-@ year @-@ old boy
back to the crime scene where his father was shot ?
sammy &apos;s trying to tell us something .
i think it &apos;s important we try to figure out what .
well , who decides whether the harm to sammy &apos;s well @-@ being
is worth whatever information you may or may not get
by doing such a thing ?
he &apos;s a child , and i don &apos;t think you get to choose
what &apos;s best for him .
everyone , this is lizzie sparks ,
sammy &apos;s aunt .
help !
don &apos;t do that !
are you ok ?
ali , you made me do that .
i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t want to do that . are you all right ?
why are you doing this ?
i ain &apos;t got a choice . i gotta get my boys back .
this can &apos;t help you get them back .
don &apos;t say that .
i got 2 more days to prove that i &apos;m fit .
fit ? just let me go .
please .
i will .
but you gotta do something for me first .
i still don &apos;t see why you have to take him back to that place .
sammy was playing the piano
when his parents were abducted ,
so taking him back to the exact location
might trigger an important response .
no , but he &apos;s fragile .
it could also wound him further .
i &apos;m not sure what i &apos;m supposed to do here .
you &apos;re sammy &apos;s legal guardian right now .
the decision &apos;s yours .
no . he barely knows her .
lizzie , is it ? for all we know ,
she &apos;s the &quot; l &quot; he &apos;s afraid of .
sammy saw his aunt and didn &apos;t even react .
if she was the abductor ,
we &apos;d have seen a visceral response .
you can &apos;t be sure of that . he &apos;s in shock .
we are running a background check right now .
on me ?
it &apos;s just procedure .
but you have to decide .
what do you want us to do ?
i &apos;m sorry , ali .
i never meant to hurt charlie .
why didn &apos;t you just ask us for the money ?
if you were in trouble , we would have helped you .
i couldn &apos;t , ali . you got sammy and all and i ...
i get that . someday you &apos;ll get this .
please , just let us go .
i need to get back to my son .
i will .
but i gotta tie you up first .
what ?
i &apos;m gonna get my boys ,
i &apos;m gonna go across the state line ,
then i &apos;ll call 911 and i &apos;ll tell them
where you and charlie are
and they &apos;ll come get you , i promise you .
charlie doesn &apos;t have that kind of time .
he needs a doctor .
he &apos;ll be fine , i promise .
charlie ?
charlie ! charlie ? charlie ?
oh , no ! charlie .
no ... charlie !
hey . so , the shop owner gave alison sparks 25 grand .
she wanted 30 , but the owner balked .
she &apos;s got 25 from here , 10 from the bank .
he &apos;s up to 35 , but he wants 40 .
why is that a special number ?
we should call garcia and
have her run those numbers against the list
she compiled of local residents and foreclosures ,
see if anything matches up .
ok , i &apos;ll call her right now .
seaver .
well , what do you make of that ?
it looks like it was used as a weapon .
i &apos;m betting this belongs to our guy .
you see how it &apos;s rusted at the hook end ?
give me a hint .
it &apos;s an old fisherman &apos;s trick .
you can use the crowbar to hook crab traps
and shrimp catches out at sea .
it &apos;s probably pretty common around here .
yeah , but outside the same store
alison sparks was last seen ?
our unsub is definitely a fisherman .
we found him .
where ?
he &apos;s headed for d.c. we &apos;ll meet you there .
are we sure it &apos;s him ?
it &apos;s doyle , all right .
i &apos;m looking at him right now .
he chartered a private jet .
how did he get past security checks ?
he used an alias-- chuck murray .
wasn &apos;t that--
yeah .
the name of his irish wolfhound .
he &apos;s baiting us . he wants us to know he &apos;s here .
message received .
let that bastard come to us .
when was the last time you saw him ?
on his 5th birtyday .
5 years .
charlie and i had a fight . it got ugly .
i haven &apos;t seen either one of them since .
do you think charlie &apos;s going to be ok ?
i &apos;m hopeful .
sammy , would it be all right if i sat here ?
whoa . you &apos;ve been holding out on me , sammy .
i didn &apos;t know you could play , reid .
i can &apos;t . well , i never have before ,
but it &apos;s essentially all math .
sammy , how about you play this note ...
for yes ...
and this note ...
for no .
does that sound like something you could do ?
yeah , exactly .
just like that .
now , sammy , do you remember
when the man came and took your parents away ?
sammy , i don &apos;t understand .
does this song mean something to you ?
i have run &quot; l &quot; for lizzie and nothing suspicious .
her story checks out .
what about local financial records ?
ah . i have cross @-@ referenced
every current and formerly licensed fisherman ,
crab men , shrimp men ,
friends of poseidon , comes from the sea ,
you name it men
with financial records showing default loans
totaling over 35k .
ok , what did you find ?
127 names . i know ,
do not shoot the messenger .
just tell me how to narrow it down .
do all 127 have children ?
no , but 76 do .
ok , how many of them have homes in foreclosure
versus other debt that might
not put them out onto the streets ?
oh , you are very good .
we are officially down to 24 .
send us those files .
at cybertastic speeds , my sweets .
everything all right ?
i &apos;m a stranger in my own brother &apos;s house .
my nephew doesn &apos;t recognize me .
and then i find this .
charlie told sammy about me .
i always assumed that he &apos;d never know who i was .
do you mind my asking what the fight was about ?
i was the one who suspected sammy had autism .
charlie didn &apos;t see it .
he was so upset , he kicked me out .
how did you know ?
he was ... different .
so i did some research .
charlie was blind to it .
he refused to accept what i found .
he was afraid .
any father would be ,
learning his child isn &apos;t going to have it
as easy as he did .
you sound like you talk from experience .
reid , take a look at this .
what , at sammy &apos;s flip book ?
not just a flip book . his routine .
shower , brush teeth , dress .
his entire life is planned in order .
maybe we can figure out where sammy met the unsub .
he already figured it out .
sammy sees his life in pictures .
he &apos;s been trying to speak with us ,
but he only knows how to communicate through symbols .
look , it &apos;s his language .
anchors . like my socks .
and that &apos;s the tread on your shoes .
what does the &quot; l &quot; mean ?
it &apos;s not an &quot; l. &quot;
it &apos;s a time .
3 : 00 . the time sammy wants us to know about ,
the time that he met the unsub .
where was he at 3 : 00 ?
2 : 30 , music store .
he goes there every day after school ,
and he doesn &apos;t leave until the store closes at 6 : 00 .
hey , sammy . sammy , it &apos;s almost 3 : 00 .
is there someplace you should be ?
should be store .
no , no , let him go .
hotch , i think we &apos;ve got something .
morgan , we need to fast @-@ forward to 3 p.m.
if i &apos;m right , the unsub is somewhere on this tape .
reid , here &apos;s when sammy gets to the store .
they changed the music . why would they do that ?
it &apos;s for sammy .
classical might be more comforting than hard rock .
ok , here &apos;s 3 : 00 .
that &apos;s the song .
sammy &apos;s been trying to tell us who took his parents all along .
at 3 p.m. the song plays ,
the same song every day at the same time
because charlie sparks puts the cd in at 2 : 30
when sammy arrives . sammy &apos;s never late
because sammy sticks to a schedule , a routine .
30 minutes later ...
this man arrives .
a deliveryman with a routine all of his own .
we need to figure out who that is , because he &apos;s our unsub .
former fisherman turned part @-@ time deliveryman ,
saddled with more debt than
he and his recently removed sons could sustain ,
including a foreclosing house and a defaulted boat loan .
why didn &apos;t you tell me you were looking for bill thomas
at 1024 elmwood avenue ?
what about his boat ?
docked in the marina .
we &apos;re closer to the house .
ok , we &apos;ll take the boat . let &apos;s go .
fbi !
morgan , he &apos;s not here .
i know , hotch . we got him .
bill thomas !
this is the fbi !
give yourself up ! your boat is surrounded !
we don &apos;t want anyone else to get hurt , bill .
turn yourself in !
all right , listen up .
we move in as soon as swat is in position .
what &apos;s going on in there ?
are you gonna respond ?
i had it , ali .
a dream .
not a big one .
it was my dream .
i put food on the table .
i had a family .
they loved me .
he was my dream .
here .
take this .
what are you doing ?
i can &apos;t take care of my boys if i go to jail .
bill , i can &apos;t .
if i do it myself , they won &apos;t get my life insurance policy .
just do it .
no .
i &apos;m not like you .
i know the difference between right and wrong .
you will , damn it .
you will do it . look at all i took away from you .
charlie , he &apos;s gone . he ain &apos;t never comin &apos; back .
you understand that ?
you &apos;re gonna be alone at sammy &apos;s graduation .
he &apos;s never gonna hear the voice of his father
stop .
or even remember what it sounds like .
charlie &apos;s not gonna read to you in bed .
he told me he did that , didn &apos;t he ?
he &apos;s not gonna kiss you .
stop .
you &apos;re never gonna feel his touch again .
you &apos;re gonna grow old alone , ali .
alone .
your dream &apos;s over .
move in !
ma &apos;am . ma &apos;am , are you hurt ?
i knew you were watching me .
what &apos;s the expression ?
keeps your friends close , your enemies under surveillance ?
i &apos;ve been here for 2 hours .
you should know better than to keep a lady waiting .
it seems hypocritical ,
seeing as i had to wait 7 years .
hello , ian .
hello , lauren .
oh , wait . lauren reynolds died in a car accident , didn &apos;t she ?
what do you want ?
you .
oh , not today . don &apos;t worry about that .
but soon .
i &apos;ve got a glock leveled at your crotch .
what &apos;s to stop me from taking you
and the little ones out right now ?
you &apos;d never make it back to your car and you know it .
tell me , does the lovely penelope
know the truth about you ?
or is she too busy watching movies with derek to care ?
here you are , all alone ,
while aaron sits at home with his son .
and why didn &apos;t dave and ashley invite you to their game night ?
maybe they thought you &apos;d be on the metro with dr. reid .
oh , that one does have some quirks .
come near my team and i will end you .
i don &apos;t have a quarrel with them .
how long that remains the case
depends entirely on you .
they &apos;re innocent .
you are not .
i was doing my job .
i think you did a little more than that .
you took the only thing that mattered to me .
so i &apos;m going to take the only thing that matters to you .
your life .
honore de balzac once said ,
&quot; most people of action are inclined to fatalism ,
and most of thought believe in providence . &quot;
