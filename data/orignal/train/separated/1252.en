Watch out!
We have one choice here.
Make it look like Rollins skipped town.
What happened with Hanna, it was confusing.
But that's all it was. A moment of confusion.
I just need more time.
I judged you too quickly.
Why don't we start over? Let's get dinner this week.
I'm Marco.
I'm leaving.
You've written a really beautiful love story for Nicole.
I can finally hear her name now
without trying to...put my fist through a wall.
If we just stay calm and stick to the plan, we'll be fine.
This is about containment, and right now
everyone who knows about Rollins is sitting in this car.
And by the time the police realize that he's missing
he'll be halfway towards Philly.
I thought I could go back in there, but I can't.
Everyone is counting on us.
You promise you'll come back for me.
We find the burner phone, we find Elliot's accomplice.
It's Mary Drake. Who else could it possibly be?
Hi, Archer. It's Jenna.
Emily, hey, I thought you might want to stop by Ali's
on your way to Hollis.
They're releasing her this morning.
And I look kinda conspicuous standing here alone.
I still feel horrible
that I ever believed that she did it.
Okay, she just got here, so call her, text her or just come by.
Hi, we tried to get you out.
It's okay.
I figured it out.
Is that Jason?
Nope, Jason couldn't make it.
Okay, so who..
A casserole?
Aria, what a thoughtful gesture. Thank you.
Just, uh, little something in case
Alison doesn't wanna cook dinner.
Well, we have to ask you around, you know
sometime soon to repay the kindness.
But for now..
...Alison needs her rest.
I could use the company.
Well, that's what you have me for.
You're staying here?
Doctor's orders.
Terms of my release.
Aunt Mary
do you mind if we have a moment?
Of course.
What the hell is she doing here?
After what happened with Elliot
Welby's concerned that I'll sue
so they're doing an internal investigation and..
...she's gonna be staying with me
until a social worker can review my case.
She was helping him
in zombie make-up.
I had to get out of there somehow.
And it's easier to keep an eye on her here.
What's going on with Jenna?
Do we know why she was calling Elliot?
Mona's got his burner phone.
She's been digging around, but we haven't heard--
Ladies, I'm sorry
but I really must insist.
Ali...do you want me to stay?
She's just gonna keep acting like a demented den-mother
if you're here.
Leave me alone with her. I'll get some answers
and I'll check in later.
I don't like this.
Trust me...neither do I.
第七季第五集
Elliot contacted me in London.
He told me about Charlotte.
That she survived
only to be murdered.
And that nearly shattered me, having my baby given back to me
in the same moment she was taken away.
Elliot seemed to share in my grief.
Could I get a glass of water?
Elliot and I had Charlotte in common too.
He sucked me in in the same way.
What I don't understand
is how you could agree to help a stranger
drive another person insane.
Rollins was clever
manipulative
and I was...so vulnerable.
As we consoled one another, he began to share his suspicions.
That I killed Charlotte.
I did nothing but try and help her.
I didn't know you, Alison
and my experiences with your mother made it easy for me
to believe you were cut from the same cloth.
And that's why you thought I deserved to die?
I never agreed to that.
He told me that Charlotte wanted me to have her money
and that for me was justice but..
he wanted vengeance.
I tried to talk him out of it
but he was intent on taking an eye for an eye.
And now I regret ever believing a thing he told me.
Alison, I hope that my telling the truth
will earn your forgiveness.
I have so little family left. I never should have..
Do we know anything else about who he really is?
The police know that Elliot Rollins is a fake identity
that he wasn't even a real doctor.
They're still investigating.
Well, it's been quite an emotional morning.
I could use a lie down.
Which way is the guestroom, please?
It's upstairs, at the end of the hall.
It's an old mattress.
I hope you don't find it too uncomfortable.
I've slept on worse.
If you don't mind, I'll-I'll go upstairs now.
Morning.
You're one of those morning people, aren't you?
Coffee is a nice touch.
It's my way of saying sorry
that I talked your ear off
and kept you up all night.
No, I liked getting to know you more.
I talked until you fell asleep.
Heh, guess I missed my chance for a goodnight kiss.
Here.
For future reference
I usually talk like that when I'm nervous
and when I'm waiting for somebody to make the first move.
Anything important?
No.
Just my friends wanting to meet up in the morning before I can..
Oh, my God!
What?
Oh, no.
What?
My test started ten minutes ago.
Okay, what do you need?
Just take your time finish your coffee
spare key's in that bowl
and just lock up before you leave, okay?
Bye.
Oh! What a surprise. I wasn't expecting you.
Yeah, I just needed a quiet place to work.
How was your trip?
Good..
productive.
Are you in the middle of a thought
or can I come give you a proper hello?
Hello.
I missed you.
I missed you too
Something happened while I was away.
What do you mean?
I needed to get out of town to concentrate on Liam's notes
but I spent a night in New York.
I went to see Nicole's parents.
I wanted them to know about us and
they needed to know that I'm moving forward with my life.
Yeah. What did they say?
They were happy for me.
I never understood why they were so worried about me.
They were the ones who lost their daughter.
They didn't want you to be alone.
Yeah.
I just didn't know if it would make you uncomfortable.
No, I'm glad you went.
I'm sure that meant a lot to them.
And it felt wrong keeping a secret from you.
So can you take a break
tell me what I missed while I was away?
Nothing much, really.
正在进行考试
No, I know, I'm sorry I'm so late but..
Okay.
Oh, no.
Attention all available units.
Backup requested at Malvern Station
15 North Warren Avenue.
11-24 with possible 10-57.
10-57 肇事逃逸
Does that mean they found Rollins' car?
Yeah, an 11-24 is an abandoned vehicle
and that other code is for missing persons.
Yeah, except he's not missing.
Well, that's the way they're playing it.
Did you see that article buried in the back of the paper?
The cops are withholding details.
Does that mean we're screwed?
No, actually. It means that they think
that he's alive and on the run.
Which means that they're putting together the pieces
exactly how we want them to.
Just keep your head down.
Everything's gonna be fine.
What are you working on?
Um, business plan Lucas wants by tomorrow.
It's Aria.
She said Mona found something
on Elliot's burner phone.
There's a location besides the car
where Rollins used this phone a lot.
Well, did she say where it was?
No, I guess it's hard to trace.
Mona said that it might take a while.
Okay, what else?
Well, she recovered his deleted text
and...found this.
Wait a minute, so Rollins knew that
Ali didn't kill Charlotte.
He sent that the night he took Alison out of Welby.
Okay, if this text means what I think it means..
He wasn't taking Alison somewhere to kill her.
I thought we were the ones who helped
convince him Ali did it.
Do we know who he sent this to?
No, there's no names in the contact list
and Mona thinks that that number probably belongs
to another burner phone.
I mean, how much do wanna bet that
that number belongs to Jenna?
Why would Jenna actually care who killed Charlotte?
I don't know.
How did he know that Ali didn't do it?
I...don't know.
And he can't tell us now, can he?
I would've been there this morning, but I overslept.
Late night.
Shift at the bar?
No, I had a date.
Didn't know you were seeing anyone.
Yeah, it's new.
Okay, 23 Wexford Street, apartment 109?
We're supposed to recognize that?
I thought maybe Ali would.
Mona said that's where Rollins used his burner.
Maybe, but that's not where he lived.
He rented a guest cottage in town.
Old stone carriage house somebody converted.
I thought it was so romantic.
So...Rollins had a burner phone
and a burner apartment?
Nothing he told me was true.
Not where he lived, what his name was, where he was from.
Ali, Rollins wasn't trying to kill you that night.
At least, we don't think so anymore.
That doesn't make him any less of an ass.
We don't know who he was texting, do we?
I vote Jenna.
She is definitely a liar.
My guess is Mary Drake.
According to her story, she bailed when things got..
...murdery.
And you believe Mary?
Believe her, maybe.
Trust her...not yet.
Maybe we should go to this...burner apartment.
You know, maybe then we could find out who he was texting.
Yeah, and who this person is
that thought I killed Charlotte.
Great idea but we can't.
Hanna said it sounds like the police found the car
so maybe they've already figured out who Rollins really is.
Well, so then we need to get there before they do.
No, Aria's right.
If the cops find out, they could tie us
to his disappearance.
So we do nothing.
It's too risky, Em.
God, all those lies I told
you think I would've seen Elliot coming from a mile away.
Ezra.
Hello?
Nicole, is that you?
Hello?
There is no explanation that I can think of for a ghost
with an international calling plan.
What is that sound?
Practicing my pisco sour.
I can't get my egg whites to froth.
Why don't you just come over.
We'll day drink until you calm down.
That's actually not a bad idea.
No, just tell me what to do.
Aria, Nicole is dead, okay.
They had a funeral for her. The case is officially closed.
And you obviously can't tell Ezra.
What good would it do?
You know, the same thing happened
about three months after my dad died.
Did you freak out?
No. But my mom did.
She sent out boxes of clothing and things to my cousin.
He was in a flood and lost almost everything.
My dad's phone ended up in one of the boxes
and... without thinking about it
my cousin used my dad's phone to call my mom.
And it looked like your dad was calling her.
I'll delete the call.
I think it's for the best.
Bye.
晚点再谢我 忘恩负义的贱人 -AD
Hey, Spence.
I'm sorry. I really hate to bug you with this
but I've been trying to find Caleb.
He hasn't been returning messages or calls
for the past couple of days.
Are you at the State Park?
Yeah.
Did you drive to the parking lot at the Laura campground?
That's the one that Caleb likes.
Yeah, I tried there, and I tried the trail hut
that ends at the falls and the bait and tackle shop too.
Well, you can try the ranger station.
I mean, he'd have to have a day pass if he's camping there.
Hanna?
Do you see this?
She's still here.
Yeah, follow her.
We have no idea why she's back in town
or why she called Rollins' phone.
If she really was working with Rollins
we can't risk Jenna figuring out that we're on to her.
She can't see you following her.
It's not like she has working eyes in the back of her head.
I'm talking about the cops.
Me acting normal doesn't include
tiptoeing around behind a girl with a big white cane.
I think I have another way to check up on Jenna.
Ranger station, go.
I'll call you if I find anything.
Okay, thank you.
Thank me later, ungrateful bitch.
Alright, can we day drink, just a little?
Right now, we're thinking, not drinking.
Well, there's something bugging me about this text.
You know, why would A.D. do me any favors?
I don't know, and I don't even wanna think about
what you're gonna have to do to repay the debt.
I'm not gonna wait around for A.D. to twist my arm with this.
Em..
Okay, I-I really don't think you should do that.
Is it Jenna?
No, it's just a number.
"The usual spot." Where the hell is that?
There's only one place I can think of.
The burner apartment.
What if the cops show up?
Well, hopefully, we'll find out who is helping Rollins first.
Whether it's Mary Drake or Jenna Marshall.
If we have something to hand over to the cops
there's no more A.D.
How are we supposed to get in?
Seatbelts first, question's later--
Hey, I was just thinking about you.
Hey, Sabrina.
Aria, right?
Yeah. Hey.
Um, nice to see you, again.
Um, well, you guys are going somewhere, I don't wanna keep--
No, it's fine. We're..
Okay. Uh, I was just wondering how your test went?
It was good. Great.
Okay.
Uh, well, I have some deliveries to make.
Our guy didn't show so..
Okay.
Sorry, that was really awkward.
Oh, come on. We need to get there first.
Did Elliot leave this mess for you?
I can help you tidy up.
Where is it?
You tell me what it is you're after
I can help you find it.
You know what I'm after.
You helped him take it, and now it's all gone.
He double-crossed me.
What are you talking about?
That lying bastard was just greedy.
Are you sure that he took everything?
Checkings, savings, joint accounts
my safety deposit boxes
and my shares at the Carissimi Group.
It's all gone!
Okay, okay.
He must have used his power of attorney
to empty the accounts and escaped
but...the police will find him.
You'll get your money back.
What if they don't find him?
Alison, I'm so terribly sorry.
Just tell me what it is
that you want me to do, and I'll do it.
I wanna make this right.
I can't sleep in here.
I'd like to file a missing persons report.
Official or off the record?
Help me, Toby Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
I'm sorry. It was a terrible joke.
I don't even know why..
That means he's staying with you.
No, but you know where he is.
Caleb just needs some time to think.
Okay. He'll reach out to you when he's ready.
This is messy. I'm sorry. I didn't..
Sorry you got pulled into it.
He's my friend...so are you.
If you want, I can tell him that you stopped by and--
No! No, no, no. Thank you though.
Um, I should, I should go. I was just..
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Hi there.
Have you guys met?
No. I don't think we have.
Okay. Um, Spencer Hastings, this is Detective Marco Furey.
He is my new supervisor on the Rollins case.
It's nice to meet you.
Yes, you as well.
Uh, well, I'm sure you guys have a lot of work to do
so I will let you get to it.
Right over here in the..
This doesn't fit..
Jenna. What a treat?
Alison? I thought you were in the hospital.
So you came to my house.
To find out how you were doing.
I figured you wouldn't wanna see me
but I didn't think there was any harm in..
...asking your husband.
Elliot doesn't live here anymore.
Did something happen?
You tell me.
You seem to know a lot about what's happening
in my private life.
How do you and Elliot know each other?
Um...this was a mistake.
Your mistake was trying to convince him
that I killed Charlotte.
You haven't been well, Alison.
I think you're confused.
Am I?
The next time you call Archer
tell him I said to go to hell!
Maybe he's already there.
Do you think $20 was enough to keep the manager quiet?
I slipped him a number two.
Well, number two, Imperial Garden.
I hope he likes moo-shu..
What a dump.
It's like Rollins was two different people.
Yeah, or someone else was living here.
Well, whoever it is is a slob.
The sink is disgusting.
Hey, help me pull down the Murphy bed.
It's stuck.
Oh, my god!
It's a head. It's a head. It's a head.
Whose head?
I don't know.
I don't wanna know. I can't look at that.
Em. No, don't touch it.
Oh, it's not real.
The fall broke the face off.
Who keeps a fake head stuffed under their pillow?
Someone pretending to be Darren Wilden.
'What can I get you?'
John Collins, rocks, extra sour.
'Sure thing.'
'Is this seat taken?'
The bar looks pretty empty to...me.
I'm sorry.
Here, let me help you.
Thank you.
You're Sara Harvey, aren't you?
I'm Jenna Marshall.
I think a few of the girls you know
are a few of the girls I know.
What an unfortunate thing for us to have in common?
Well, the unfortunate things make us who we are.
Can I buy you a drink?
Only if you'll have one with me.
Are you a sour girl?
Well, I can be.
Bartender, she'll have the same.
Four cherries, please.
'Coming right up.'
Are you putting your hands in there?
You're the one sitting on the bed.
There's something at the bottom.
What is that?
Elliot wasn't a slob. This mess was a cover.
You're not gonna believe what happened
while you were gone.
Aria and Emily found out that Rollins has a secret apartment.
They didn't go there, did they?
They set a trap for Jenna.
Well, get this, I used my mom's password
to get in the Radley reservation system.
Jenna just extended her stay.
Here?
She was supposed to check out this morning
but I guess something changed her mind.
Things happen, Hanna.
I mean, people change their plans.
Remember when we were only supposed to come back
for a couple of days, and we ended up
in this fricking nightmare that's kept us trapped here.
I'm sorry.
So no luck at the ranger station?
Can we please not talk about Caleb.
Spence, I don't wanna be the one who messed this up.. ...for either of you.
So...what can I do? How can I fix this?
Maybe you can start by figuring out
why you're wearing one guy's ring
when you might have feelings for another.
Passports with no photos, a couple of plane tickets.
It's like Rollins had an exit strategy in place
for him and someone else.
What's in that book?
It's a ledger. Couple of things.
For a big doctor, his handwriting is super legible.
'And he kept very detailed records.'
Cash payments to M.D. And J.M.
Mary Drake and Jenna Marshall.
He was paying them cash, but for what?
I don't know. There-there's no reference here to A.D.
Where did you find that?
Over there on the seat cushion.
Pretty sure mice lived in there.
Also, I found his personal library.
"Archer Dunhill."
A.D.
'Open up! Rosewood PD. Open up.'
I know you're in there.
Toby.
You wanna tell me why you're here?
Alison found a slip of paper
with this address on it at her house.
So we told her that we would check it out.
Do you have this slip of paper?
We left it with her.
You guys haven't been anywhere near Malvern Station lately, have you?
No. Why?
We found Rollins' car.
A receipt for six months advance rent on this place
was in the glove box.
This guy's on the run. He's dangerous.
What if he'd been hiding out here?
Listen, my new boss is waiting to hear from me.
When he does, he's gonna come by here
with a couple of detectives.
He's gonna comb through this place.
You can't be here.
Did you touch anything?
You got five minutes before I call it in.
I didn't hear you leave?
Oh, I took a walk around the neighborhood after I ate.
There's a...particular shade of blue in the evening sky.
It settles me.
Have you eaten? I could heat up some of your friend's casserole.
The song you were humming.
My mom used to sing that to me as a lullaby.
"Little Sparrow."
Your mom and I used to fall asleep to that song.
Your grandmother used to sing it to us.
It came to mind while I was out walking.
I don't know what brought that up.
Though I suppose when I think about the lyrics--
There's not a lot of birds out at night.
This song is about love, Alison.
About men...and lies.
All you maidens hede my warning
never trust the hearts of men.
They will crush you like a sparrow.
Leaving you to never mend.
I obviously wasn't paying attention.
Kind of explains a lot.
I've made those same mistakes myself one time or another.
Alright. I may read a little before bed.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Good evening. This is Detective Marco Furey
from the Rosewood Police Department.
Detective Furey?
You've been assigned to lead the investigation?
I thought it was time we met.
Thank you for coming in, Mrs. Rollins.
Uh, DiLaurentis, please.
Right. I'm sorry. Please have a seat.
We got a call from your bank's branch manager.
I, um, I told them to let me handle that.
Well, the amount of money in question
requires mandatory reporting.
I can only help if you let me.
I wasn't trying to make things difficult.
I just..
I was surprised.
I understand. He put you through hell.
And I'm sure the news at the bank today
was a little overwhelming.
But it did help us work up a theory.
And we think that your husband targeted you for your money.
It seems that he was passing himself off as a Dr. Rollins
ever since Charlotte DiLaurentis was admitted to Welby.
All of it, just so that he could...
After you were incapacitated
in the psychiatric facility, he took off.
An after-hours ticket kiosk at the Malvern Station
recorded Rollins' purchase of a train ticket.
And now we know what happened when he got off that train.
Oh, um, where do you, you think he is?
Elliot Rollins was last seen in Baltimore.
Seen?
Oh, a credit card under his assumed name was used to rent a car.
Driver was then later captured on a traffic cam
heading west on Interstate 70.
But I'm still waiting for a positive ID from the rental agent.
I mean, he could be anywhere by now.
Well, we shared his plate information and description
with the local authorities and highway patrol
as far west as Denver.
Miss DiLaurentis
this guy, he's turned your entire life upside down.
I won't stop until we find him.
And two Red Eyes and one of those lattes with soy. Thanks.
Hey, can I interrupt?
Hey, uh, yeah.
I know I said I would call
but I thought I better do this in person.
Yeah.
Listen,
when I saw you earlier today--
I was a complete weirdo. I get it.
You don't have to have the talk.
No, Sabrina, I was in a rush--
Really, there is... zero obligation.
It was just a date.
It was a first date. I mean, it was good--
Okay, look, look, look. I'm not here to have "the talk."
I wanted to ask you out again.
Oh. Okay.
Um, yeah, that is..
This is much better than a call.
I'm free on Saturday.
Great.
Thanks.
That's a lot of coffee. Late night study session?
I heard you were finishing up college at Hollis.
How did you hear that?
Toby mentioned it.
Must feel good to come home and finish what you started.
I should get back to the hotel.
Goodnight.
Rollins stole from you?
I'm completely broke. He took everything.
This just keep getting worse.
Guys, we deliberately pointed the cops towards Philly.
That's where this trail was supposed to end.
So this means..
Somebody knows. Somebody knows what I did.
Henna, you're not alone in this.
I'm gonna be sick.
God, when she panics like that, I can't even think.
Sorry.
I'll just.. I'll put it on vibrate.
Is Mary Drake behind this?
Is she trying to let the cops know
that the whole trail we set up was fake?'
I honestly don't think so.
I mean, she's been at the hospital
the past few days helping me get out.
I don't think she had time to go to Baltimore.
What about Sara and Jenna?
I mean, who even knew that Sara Harvey was still in town.
Maybe Sara is keeping an eye on us for Jenna.
That could be why she's been here all this time.
It's too strange to be a coincidence.
The two people with the biggest ax
to grind against us are-are teaming up
to chop our alibi to bits.
We'd know for sure it was them if someone had showed up
at the apartment today.
Yeah. Well, Toby's squad car probably scared them away.
Okay. I didn't tell you guys earlier
but I really screwed up today.
Jenna showed up at the house asking for Elliot
and now I think she knows that we're on to her.
Thanks to me, she knows about the burner phone
and I'm pretty sure she can figure out
that he wouldn't just give it to us without a fight.
You guys, um, it's Ezra.
Something happened today.
I have to go.
Right now, Aria?
I'm sorry. Yeah. I have to go.
It's fine.
但我在上面找不到一点证据 -AD
Ezra!
Ezra!
You look--
Confused.
Oh, I was gonna say beautiful.
What's going on?
Well, I'm gonna talk
um, for a little bit at least
and then you're going to listen.
Then it'll be your turn to talk.
You told me once a long time ago
that you couldn't...imagine your life without me
and I told you that I wanted you in mine
and that we would, we would figure something out.
And then we spent years apart, a world apart.
Five years later when you walked in the door
after all that time
it felt like, it felt like the last flat stretch of track
of a roller-coaster ride..
...right before it comes to a stop
where your stomach's flipping out and your knees are weak
but you can...breathe again.
That's when I knew..
...I want you in my life, Aria, for the rest of my life.
I don't ever wanna let you go.
Ezra.
Wait, I have...just one more thing to say.
Aria Marie Montgomery..
...will you marry me?
This has to be our last round.
So a toast to friends new and old.
Who's the extra for?
Babes and booze.
It's like you were expecting me.
Noel Kahn
Did you miss me?
