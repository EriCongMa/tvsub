for every family ,
thanksgiving is a day filled with tradition .
but for the goldbergs ,
that tradition came with an extra helping of crazy .
every year , my mom would cheese and marshmallow
everything in sight .
every year , my brother would gorge himself on half a turkey
and pass out in a food coma .
every year , i &apos;d bond with my dad over a game of football
and astound him with my total lack of knowledge .
it &apos;s like the throwing one knows
exactly where the running one is going .
every year , pops would give a tipsy toast
about an old girlfriend .
and , sure , i wake up every morning ,
and i wonder , &quot; what if i stayed with her in singapore
and learned her exotic customs ? &quot;
point is we all make our choices .
to family .
to family .
every year , my eccentric uncle marvin would visit ...
delorean !
... get in a huge fight with my dad ...
come on ! i &apos;m not staying where i &apos;m not wanted !
... and storm out with one of our pies .
good day to you , sir !
good day to you !
and every year , my mom would force erica
to spend days prepping and cooking with her .
this sacred recipe box was your nana &apos;s most prized possession ,
and we will continue the tradition
by firing up the stove by 5 : 00 a.m. sharp tomorrow .
and if all goes smoothly , by 9 : 00 a.m. ,
we &apos;ll be elbow deep in a 20 @-@ pound butterball .
or we nuke some hungry @-@ man dinners
and call it a day .
wow . i didn &apos;t know you were in the business
of destroying all your nana &apos;s favorite things .
you know , while you &apos;re at it , why don &apos;t you just smash
her precious figurine collection ,
smash everything she loved , take this poker ,
and smash my face in ? because nana loved this , too .
my god , i &apos;ll just cook the stupid meal .
oh , we &apos;re gonna have so much fun .
and it wasn &apos;t a goldberg thanksgiving
unless my mom tripled up her workouts
so she could justify gorging herself for 24 hours straight .
who &apos;s ready for some jazzercise ?
people with no shame ?
come on , lazy buns . let &apos;s earn that stuffing .
come on , come on
and work that boogie body
join in !
oh , i &apos;d like to , but i &apos;m lying .
well , make fun all you want ,
but you wouldn &apos;t last a minute in my class .
i get the feeling i &apos;d manage .
put your money where your mouth is .
come to class with me .
when you collapse halfway through from exhaustion ,
i win .
and then , we jazzercise three days a week for a month .
so , somehow , this has become a ploy to get me to hang with you .
it is moving in that direction , yes .
well , when i prove you wrong and do finish ,
i don &apos;t have to help you make thanksgiving dinner this year .
deal .
you ready for this ?
look at me . i &apos;m jazzercising .
i &apos;m a sad mom with no shame .
no , don &apos;t join in . i &apos;m mocking you .
it was november 22 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and i was spending the day with my friend , video games .
we had quite a history together .
first , there was atari .
look at those graphics .
i &apos;ll never get bored of this -- ever .
then , there was intellivision .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m skiing in real life .
and then came the greatest console of them all ,
nintendo .
yes ! first place !
what is this ? what am i looking at ?
it &apos;s &quot; track &amp; field . &quot; i just won a gold medal .
a video game with people running and jumping .
why don &apos;t you go outside
and run and jump like a regular kid ?
you never like the stuff i like .
why don &apos;t you play with the boy ?
no can do . gives me finger cramps .
and i need these hands to massage the ladies &apos; feet .
it &apos;s his closer .
all right , this conversation &apos;s been bad from top to bottom .
my dad may not have understood me ,
but thanksgiving meant the arrival of someone who did .
did someone call the butcher ?
&apos;cause the beefcake has arrived .
okay . &quot; mur @-@ man , &quot; bring it in here .
bro , ooh , i love @-@ a this face .
i love it .
stop !
sorry .
what &apos;s with the outfit ?
it &apos;s actually the crockett n &apos; tubbs collection .
the ladies love it . it &apos;s the white linen , man .
you want to feel it ?
no .
come on . feel it .
no .
just feel it !
uncle marv !
what &apos;s up ?
hey , buddy .
uncle marv !
look at this kid !
looking good , dude .
i &apos;m feeling good , dude . i lost half a pound .
and then they bumped me up to assistant manager
down at the beeper bayou in trenton .
you sell beepers now ? no way .
oh , yeah . growth industry . wave of the future .
i &apos;m gonna ride that wave right into retirement .
free samples ?
we get free beepers ? ! yes !
so impractical for a child .
no . you can &apos;t give them beepers .
they look like drug dealers .
no , they look like doctors . come on .
i &apos;m gonna go page myself for no reason .
that &apos;s the spirit . look at this kid .
okay . let &apos;s get you set up .
where &apos;s your garbage bag full of laundry for my wife to do ?
no , no , no . i &apos;m fine for this visit .
i &apos;m staying in a hotel down in abington .
&quot; hotel &quot; ?
with an &quot; h , &quot; not an &quot; m &quot; ?
yeah . it &apos;s got all the perks , man .
uncle marv , you want to go play &quot; double dragon &quot; with me ?
nintendo power magazine said it wasn &apos;t coming out till january .
you read np monthly ?
what , are you kidding me ?
that &apos;s how i get all my news , kid .
let &apos;s go .
get the hell in there !
while my dad was trying to keep his cool with his brother ,
my mom was about to turn up the heat in jazzercise class .
dear lord , it &apos;s like a &quot; twilight zone &quot; world
where everyone is you .
just zip it and go put on your workout gear .
this is my workout gear .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna wear to get in the groove ?
are you insane ?
some might say what you &apos;re wearing is insane .
for your information , spandex wicks away sweat
while enhancing muscle tone and skeletal girth .
watch and learn .
you ladies ready to sweat ? !
yeah !
reynaldo &apos;s an ex @-@ marine .
i told him not to go easy on us .
okay , you didn &apos;t tell me --
sorry . a bet &apos;s a bet .
that &apos;s a deal that can &apos;t be broken .
my sister was starting to realize
that she might have gotten in over her head .
for the next hour , my mom lunged , squatted , and grooved
with everything she had .
and erica ...
eh , she was fine .
and cool down .
i almost broke a sweat there .
but ... you ...
i won .
now i don &apos;t have to spend time cooking with you all day .
it &apos;s a thanksgiving miracle .
but it &apos;s tradition .
mm , sorry . bet &apos;s a bet .
that &apos;s a deal that can &apos;t be broken .
as my mom &apos;s thanksgiving was falling apart ,
i was having a blast with my uncle .
oh , my gosh . you &apos;re like rain man with this .
you &apos;re unbeatable . like , what is your secret ?
i have a small social circle .
after three awesome hours of video games ,
we needed a break .
so we went to see a movie about video games ,
&quot; the wizard , &quot; a classic &apos; 80s drama
about a boy who wins a fortune
in the world &apos;s biggest video @-@ game competition .
i love the power glove .
it &apos;s so bad .
you know it &apos;s based on a true story ?
i &apos;m pretty sure everything in this movie is fake .
look , i &apos;m the adult , okay ? so i &apos;m always right .
just eat your popcorn . it makes your brain grow .
that movie was so awesome !
oh , man .
and you &apos;re such a better player than that mute kid .
oh , man , if i were you ,
i would consider dropping out of school altogether
and just playing video games full time .
no . nobody &apos;s quitting school .
i &apos;m just trying to encourage your son .
to drop out .
it &apos;s a figure of speech , mur .
it &apos;s like , &quot; hey , it &apos;s raining cats and dogs , &quot;
or , &quot; you can &apos;t drink in the park here . &quot;
can &apos;t you just not be you for once ?
fine .
how about i don &apos;t encourage him to be better at anything ?
that &apos;s all i &apos;m asking .
well , buddy , you &apos;re gonna have to
listen to your old man on this one .
but not i. i bought you something .
consider it an early birthday present , okay ?
or a late one , depending on when your birthday is .
no way .
yes way .
it was the nintendo power glove .
it was magical , and it was mine .
i ... can &apos;t take this . i @-@ it &apos;s too much .
with my guidance ,
you are going to become the greatest player
that the nintendo universe has ever seen .
with my help , there will be no &quot; mario &quot; pipe un @-@ searched ,
no space un @-@ invaded , no donkey un @-@ konged !
you maniac .
what &apos;s he up to , al ?
laughing , having fun , supporting adam --
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
uh , i think he &apos;s just laughing
and having fun and supporting adam .
that &apos;s crazy . nobody does that .
do you think maybe you &apos;re a little tiny bit jealous
of the connection your brother has with your son ?
me ? jealous of marvin ?
the man who claims to have invented the rectangle .
but for the first time ever ,
uncle marvin had something my dad didn &apos;t have -- me .
it was thanksgiving morning , and my dad decided
to connect with me for the best reason possible --
to stop his brother from doing it .
hey , champ . what you up to ?
i &apos;m watching the parade .
snoopy balloon &apos;s catching a pretty heavy breeze .
good stuff .
hey , how would you like to play some video games .
you know , like &quot; froggerman &quot; or &quot; donkey kid . &quot;
you want to play video games ?
oh , yeah ! i love video games .
they &apos;re not a waste of time ,
and you learn valuable lessons , even though they &apos;re dumb .
not working . the damn thing &apos;s not working !
you &apos;re swinging it . stop swinging .
i &apos;m batting ? i thought i was pitching .
what are you doing ? just move like a normal human would .
what &apos;s wrong with my guy ?
why is he squatting ? it looks like he &apos;s sick .
he &apos;s just bunting . stop bunting !
i can &apos;t stop bunting !
just push the &quot; pause &quot; button .
well , which is the &quot; pause &quot; button ?
stop mashing the buttons with your giant sausage fingers .
okay ! now you &apos;re aggravating me !
get this off of me !
it &apos;s stuck on my normal @-@ sized fingers !
no -- be gentle .
no ! no !
you broke it !
you broke my favorite thing in the world !
you ruin everything !
as my father took a big swing and missed ,
my mother was feeling the effects of her own loss .
whoa . i slept for 12 hours .
you know when you get too much sleep
and then you &apos;re tired ?
i might need a nap later .
i slept for two hours ,
had a nightmare that i &apos;d abandoned you ,
and then i woke up and remembered
that you &apos;d abandoned me .
so i just came downstairs to start this entire meal by myself
like some sort of daughterless mother .
so , we &apos;re both good then ?
double or nothing ! let &apos;s go double or nothing .
give me a chance to win you back .
please stop .
if i win , you have to cook thanksgiving dinner with me
and learn all my traditions and never leave my side .
fine .
but if i win , i get to avoid this craziness altogether
and go to lainey &apos;s for thanksgiving .
you wouldn &apos;t .
i would .
and her family eats their dinner in front of the tv .
it &apos;s both sad and awesome .
deal . but this time , no jazzercise .
we &apos;re gonna power walk .
you mean that non @-@ running thing you do every morning ?
did you know that the world &apos;s fastest power walker
out @-@ walked a cheetah ?
yeah , that &apos;s not true .
ankle weights on !
okay , power walking has one and only one rule --
at least one foot must be in contact with the ground at all times .
otherwise , it would just be running ,
which makes way more sense ,
but this is what you guys want to do ,
so it is what it is .
first one around the block wins .
and ...
walk !
some say it was carl lewis
who ran the most epic race in the &apos; 80s .
but in our family , it was this .
stop ! stop power walking into my body !
the bevernator stops for no one .
slipped up .
you stepped in dog poop .
nice try .
no , i &apos;m serious .
really ?
that was low !
that was low !
keep one foot on the ground !
you keep one foot on the ground !
you &apos;re running . that &apos;s against the rules .
but i &apos;ll allow it &apos; cause i don &apos;t care .
take that !
yes ! yes ! i won !
oh , it hurts .
something happened in my downstairs .
it &apos;s just north of my vajingo .
how &apos;s your groin ?
it hurts .
but not as bad as my heart .
i lost her , murray . i lost our little girl .
i get it .
the kids would much rather see their friends ,
play video games , hang out with your dumbass brother .
are we still talking about me ?
i got a thing , too . i &apos;m allowed .
well , not today .
help me over to that office chair
so i can roll around .
bevy , you can &apos;t cook thanksgiving in a roller chair .
i have to try .
that &apos;s it .
we &apos;ll order chinese .
oh , no , you won &apos;t !
the stakes are too high .
i need this meal .
i need to be knocked motionless by meat and gravy .
i need to eat until my pants grow tight
and i move into elastic sweats .
will i ever touch that weird , gloppy cranberry thing ?
probably not .
but i deserve to find out .
give me this . give me thanksgiving .
i &apos;m sorry , love bug . i tried , but i can &apos;t .
my groin is out of commission .
then let me be your groin .
you &apos;re burning the rolls .
i didn &apos;t say 600 . i said 375 .
ohh ! i &apos;m not a scientist !
oh , this is hopeless .
you haven &apos;t even cleaned the turkey yet .
i told you -- i &apos;m not reaching my hand in a turkey &apos;s butt !
no way !
it &apos;s not that big a deal . just do it .
oh , no .
oh , it &apos;s all cold and rubbery !
aah ! i touched something wet ! i touched something wet !
well , do something .
i &apos;ll use the nerd glove .
don &apos;t worry , champ .
i &apos;ll get that power glove fixed for you no problem --
ohh , boy . it &apos;s in the butt .
why ? why ? !
okay , so , i know that it &apos;s thanksgiving ,
and i want to say what i &apos;m thankful for .
my freedom . i &apos;m leaving now .
please , erica . i need you .
i love barry , but he ruins everything .
she &apos;s right . i suck .
what &apos;s going on ? what did marvin do now ?
i &apos;m just here dealing with the glove in the butt .
why you got to accuse me of stuff ?
i &apos;ll tell you why .
because you &apos;ve always got an angle .
you got some kind of grift going on .
i get caught grifting three times ,
and he &apos;s never gonna let me forget it already .
just let him forget it already .
you brainwashed the kid , too .
i don &apos;t want you two spending any more time together .
oh , well , then you &apos;re really not gonna like us
traveling around the country together
competing in nintendo championships !
what ?
like in &quot; the wizard . &quot;
he wants to take me town to town
to hustle people in video games .
it &apos;s win @-@ win ... if he wins .
this has been fun , but , uh , where are my car keys , mom ?
how should i know ?
open your hand .
no .
open your hand .
no .
i shouldn &apos;t have to even say this out loud .
no one here is pursuing a career in video gaming .
you know , i don &apos;t have to take this abuse .
i &apos;m out of here .
i got a perfectly good red lobster
right across from my hotel .
oh , here we go .
good day to you , sir .
good day to you , sir !
no , good day to you , sir !
okay , you &apos;re not going anywhere .
it &apos;s thanksgiving !
unacceptable !
yes !
all of this is unacceptable !
i &apos;m free !
damn it ! i dropped the orange potatoes !
erica , take me with you .
everybody , stop leaving me .
it &apos;s thanksgiving !
have you been faking it this whole time ?
no .
it &apos;s a thanksgiving miracle .
no . i &apos;m not going to lainey &apos;s for thanksgiving .
i &apos;m going for the whole weekend .
i got turkey schmutz on my hand for you .
now , this feels like thanksgiving .
i wrangled this out of the turkey butt .
toweled it off for you .
i don &apos;t want it .
come on .
you can &apos;t honestly be angry at me
for not letting you roam around the country with your uncle .
he &apos;d lose you at the first rest stop .
well , it &apos;s your loss ,
&apos;cause i could have been the champion and won it all --
money , mansions , yachts , fast cars , fast women .
i think you may be overestimating the prizes .
of course i am !
the world of high @-@ stakes nintendo isn &apos;t even real .
then why the hell would you go along with your uncle ?
&apos;cause it was nice for someone to actually get me for once .
as this landed with my dad ,
my sister was more than ready to take off .
going somewhere ?
pops , please .
i don &apos;t want to hear one of your adorable , wise lectures
that makes me a better person .
fine , i won &apos;t mix in .
but did you ever wonder
why this holiday makes your mother so crazy ?
&apos;cause she &apos;s crazy ?
for sure , but there &apos;s a reason
why this day means so much to her .
because she always made dinner with nana .
i know all about it .
well , what you don &apos;t know is
that your mom was 17 when she lost nana .
i didn &apos;t realize that .
that box of recipes , the two of you cooking together ,
it all brings back your grandmother for her .
why do you always got to make me a better person ?
come on . let &apos;s go have thanksgiving .
my dad was also trying to be a better person
by beeping his brother to get him back ...
... no matter how far away he was ,
which turned out to be very close .
hey . mur @-@ man .
what brings you down to your basement on thanksgiving ?
beeping ! what are you doing here ? !
i thought you were staying at a hotel .
i have a perfectly good explanation .
i &apos;m a liar .
but what about the money , the beeper bayou in trenton ?
i got fired . it was totally unfounded .
all i did was sleep with the boss &apos;s wife
for , like , a bunch of times .
everything you do is wrong .
you &apos;re right . i just ...
i should just stay as far away from your kid as humanly possible .
well , actually ...
that &apos;s the one thing you &apos;ve been doing right .
and i may have said some things ,
and that was only because ...
... i , uh -- i was jealous .
you were jealous ?
i was ... jealous .
of me ?
i mean , yeah .
i &apos;m the guy who invented the rectangle .
okay . are you jealous of anything else ?
like my cool threads ?
no .
what about my awesome hairdo ?
no , i &apos;m good .
what about the fact that you &apos;re gonna let me borrow $ 4,000
to invest in a garbage barge ?
yeah , my uncle still annoyed my dad ,
but it was thanksgiving .
it was a time for forgiving .
all right .
you get the eggs , and i &apos;ll get the hand mixer .
shmoopie . you came home .
i guess i didn &apos;t want to miss out on our tradition .
oh , my little turkey .
i cooked you in my oven .
okay , come on . don &apos;t make me regret this .
let &apos;s go . we got a family to feed .
honey , it &apos;s too late . we &apos;d have to start from scratch .
hey . we are goldbergs .
and we &apos;re gonna kick thanksgiving &apos;s ass .
and they did . that day , they were in perfect sync .
and it was all my mom ever wanted .
we did it .
we kicked thanksgiving &apos;s ass .
i know i always drink too many martinis ,
and i ... give a toast
about some beautiful dame from my past , but ...
this is for my wife , irene --
the most beautiful dame who ever lived .
here , here .
and that &apos;s a goldberg thanksgiving .
to lainey . - we stuck to all of our traditions --
pops gave his toast ,
my dad argued with marvin at the table ,
and barry ate himself into a coma .
but this year , there was one tradition that was new .
move over . i want to shoot some ducks .
but w @-@ what about your football match ?
don &apos;t even try , all right ?
yep .
my dad and i played video games together ,
and it was glorious .
why is the dog laughing at me ?
because you &apos;re terrible .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing .
here , you show me .
you hold it like this .
tell me my life , okay ? tell me my life .
i watched you -- - as dictated by barry and beverly goldberg .
don &apos;t ruin my dinner . come on , now .
you &apos;re ruining my dinner , okay ?
be -- be my guest .
goodbye .
goodbye .
oh , come on , now , murray .
you &apos;re yelling at me . i don &apos;t need this crap .
can you give me a hand in making some posters ?
i &apos;m trying to advertise my new business .
what could you ever offer the world
that anyone would pay for ?
we own a mower . i got a beeper .
someone beeps me ,
i rush over and tend to all their landscaping needs .
that &apos;s ... actually not a bad idea .
i know , right ?
i &apos;ve been posting signs all over the neighborhood .
&quot; barry , the grass king -- for all your grass needs .
beep me . &quot;
genius , right .
ooh . i got one .
and another .
oh ! and another .
idiot -- you &apos;re a guy with a beeper
who calls himself the grass king .
don &apos;t you get it ?
yeah . i &apos;m gonna be rich .
