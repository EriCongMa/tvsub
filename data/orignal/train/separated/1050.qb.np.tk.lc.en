neal .
when my dad went away , ellen looked after me .
sam ? did he know my father ?
a hard guy to get hold of .
who did this to you ?
trust sam .
if you find any information that leads to sam ...
i will tell you .
you tell him you want to meet on neutral ground .
发送至未证实地址
get in the car .
i wasn &apos;t sure i &apos;d hear back from you , sam .
where are we going ?
someplace less obvious .
so do i call you caffrey or bennett ?
bennett was my name a long time ago .
not anymore .
i &apos;ve been tracking you since --
ellen &apos;s funeral .
i remember .
i knew her as kathryn hill .
ellen &apos;s name before witsec ?
she told me you worked deep cover back in d.c. ,
said you were close .
after your father went down for murder ,
there weren &apos;t many in our department i could trust .
you knew my dad ?
in your e @-@ mail , you said you &apos;d meet me on my terms .
here are my terms . i ask the questions .
i don &apos;t like the answers ,
i get back in that car , and i drive away . understood ?
understood .
what do you do for the fbi ?
i &apos;m a confidential informant .
it &apos;s the deal i cut to get out of prison .
the man at the funeral -- your handler ?
peter burke . he can be trusted .
he can help us find ellen &apos;s --
if you think this is about one guy pulling one trigger ,
you &apos;re as naive as your father .
the men who took him down -- the men who had ellen murdered .
they were corrupt cops .
who rose up the ranks of government and law enforcement .
i &apos;m sure there are some in the bureau .
and they will do whatever it takes to protect themselves .
so , what ? she asked you to help me expose them ?
working with the fbi wasn &apos;t part of the deal .
peter can help us .
all it takes is one report .
how do you think ellen &apos;s name got leaked ?
no . not peter .
all right , assuming this stays between us ,
how do we take them down ?
start with the evidence ellen collected on dirty cops 30 years ago .
where is it ?
she was planning to hand that over when she got here .
so you don &apos;t even know where it is ?
give me a chance .
sorry , caffrey .
you &apos;ve already maxed out on your quota of answers i don &apos;t like .
so that &apos;s it ? you &apos;re leaving ?
sam , i need the truth about ellen and my father .
you asked me if i knew him .
i did .
so , the key broke off in the lock ?
yeah .
are you sure it &apos;s a rental ?
new model , low mileage ,
cheap plastic key fob .
hexagonal .
that &apos;s either street fleet or zenith .
i &apos;ll keep an eye out for repair requests
on a gray suv with a key stuck in the door lock .
all right .
let &apos;s say you find sam -- again .
he &apos;s made it clear he doesn &apos;t trust you .
well , i have to convince him that he can .
you know , trust works both ways .
you don &apos;t think i should trust sam ?
i &apos;m simply saying you should go in with both eyes open .
and the suit has the resources to be those eyes .
you realize somewhere pigs are flying right now .
yes . and that is the sound of hell freezing over .
look , peter catches wind you &apos;re up to something ,
he &apos;s gonna follow you .
he may as well be informed .
yeah , and if he puts his investigation on the books ,
it could put him at risk .
you could ask him to be quiet . he &apos;s done it before .
yeah , well , not happily .
but he &apos;s done it .
on november 6th , you visited the defendant &apos;s penthouse ,
posing as an investor for his condo development .
what evidence did you uncover ?
delancy showed me a vial of benzene .
he said it was known to cause cancer ,
specifically leukemia .
did he say what he planned to do with this particular vial ?
he said he planned to use it
to lace the soil samples taken by caplin environmental .
when the results would come back toxic ,
he &apos;d evict the tenants from his property ,
tear down their homes ,
and eventually start construction on his luxury condos ,
exactly as he &apos;d done once before .
after delancy showed you this vial ...
peter working on his direct for the delancy trial ?
ah , he &apos;s the prosecution &apos;s star witness .
and the only thing he loves more than arresting criminals ...
is testifying against them at their trial .
oh , i remember . vividly .
perfect . then i say , &quot; no further questions , &quot;
and if all goes well ...
the jury finds delancy guilty of mortgage fraud
and 98 counts of civil rights violations .
and since the fbi never recovered the benzene vial ,
this whole case is resting on your testimony .
and your key question .
it &apos;s like it &apos;s christmas morning and he &apos;s unwrapping a guilty verdict .
instead of laced , &quot; i &apos;ll say the samples were &quot; tainted . &quot;
tainted &apos;s more descriptive .
neal , you remember josh bryson ,
assistant u.s. attorney .
josh .
i hear you &apos;ve been wiping the floor with the delancy defense .
and with peter &apos;s testimony today ,
i plan to put them out of their misery .
don &apos;t forget i worked that case with peter .
delancy showed me the vial of benzene , too ,
when i was working undercover at caplin environmental
as a biochemical analyst , so if you --
thank you , neal , but i already have peter .
and he , uh ...
how do i put this ?
don &apos;t have a dark and sordid past as a professional con man ?
or an off @-@ again , off @-@ again relationship with the whole truth ?
or even--
point taken , so ...
you &apos;re more than welcome to sit in the gallery and watch me testify .
ah , i would love to , but i should --
you know , i should probably stay here and just sharpen pencils .
i &apos;ll see you in an hour , peter .
all right , josh .
have a great trial .
thank you .
since when are you interested in taking the stand ?
ever since i realized that testifying is a con .
testifying isn &apos;t a con .
it &apos;s a narrative crafted to have the greatest impact on a jury .
you &apos;re convincing the jury your narrative is right .
it &apos;s a con .
nope . conning involves deceit .
oh , a lie of omission isn &apos;t deceit ?
my testimony isn &apos;t a lie of omission .
are you mentioning the part
where the benzene was nowhere to be found
when you showed up with the warrant later ?
bryson is asking what i uncovered , not recovered .
big difference .
so , testifying is as much about the questions as it is the answers .
exactly .
then i stand corrected .
testifying is a two @-@ man con .
go sharpen your pencils .
okay .
... which allowed him to tear down their homes
to build luxury condos .
and you suspected mr. burke would attempt this scheme a second time ?
you mean mr. delancy .
i will restate .
you suspected mr. delancy would attempt the scheme a second time .
correct .
he was looking for an investor for another condo development .
while undercover , i was that investor .
now , in your grand jury testimony ,
you state that you visited the defendant &apos;s penthouse
on november 6th of last year .
on that date ,
what evidence of his previous crime did you recover ?
you mean uncover ?
correct . on that date ,
what evidence of delancy &apos;s previous crime did you recover ?
on that date , i didn &apos;t recover any evidence ,
but the defendant showed me --
objection . non @-@ responsive .
sustained .
i @-@ i will restate .
agent burke , on that date ,
what evidence did you uncover ?
mr. delancy showed me a vial of benzene .
thought i &apos;d swing by on my lunch , see how it went .
by the looks of it , not well .
bryson blew it .
he was nervous , jumpy .
he botched the key question .
bryson doesn &apos;t botch anything .
exactly .
peter , you don &apos;t think delancy might have gotten to him .
if he did , a guilty man is gonna walk .
hey , josh . come on in .
can i get you something ? coffee ?
thanks , elizabeth .
glad you came .
josh , what the hell happened ?
before court today , i received a phone call .
i was told to throw the case or these go public .
josh .
i take it these aren &apos;t photoshopped ?
the woman in these photos -- she was in the court today .
she &apos;s delancy &apos;s girlfriend .
sleeping with the defense &apos;s girlfriend .
this is grounds for a mistrial .
josh--
it &apos;s not what you think .
a few weeks back , i &apos;m in a bar , grabbing a drink after work .
this attractive woman approaches and starts chatting me up .
she invites me over to her place .
you get the idea .
oh , no . we see the idea .
i swear to you , before this morning ,
i had no idea who she was .
did you throw today on purpose ?
no .
i got rattled . i didn &apos;t know what to do .
and if you step down ,
there &apos;s a good chance a criminal goes free .
what &apos;s the point of arresting these bastards
if you can &apos;t prosecute them ?
can you help ?
these are the photos being used to blackmail bryson .
that &apos;s delancy &apos;s girlfriend ?
she is dedicated to her man .
and limber .
and unfortunately , she &apos;s not talking .
we &apos;ll have to go after the next best thing .
landon shepard .
she was delancy &apos;s first call after his arrest last year .
and she was in court yesterday .
says she &apos;s an executive consultant .
she &apos;s who you call when the c.e.o. of your fortune 500 company
crashes his bentley with his 18 @-@ year @-@ old mistress &apos;s head on his lap .
or when the fbi is closing in
and you &apos;ve got a vial of benzene in the top drawer of your desk .
she &apos;s a fixer .
she &apos;s good . she &apos;s connected .
a year later , we still can &apos;t pin anything on her .
can we subpoena her phone records ?
all incoming calls go to an office voicemail .
so far , we &apos;ve been unable to link any other number to her .
she gets in your head .
i mean , i questioned her a year ago , and in five minutes ,
she could tell things about me that my own mother couldn &apos;t .
it wasn &apos;t right .
we have to find a way to get to her .
or she could come to us .
diana .
ms. shepard , my name is --
agent burke .
i hear you &apos;ve been asking questions about me behind my back .
again .
i thought i &apos;d stop by and save you the trouble .
agent berrigan and i would love to chat with you .
no clinton jones today ?
don &apos;t tell me .
he &apos;s off seeking daddy &apos;s approval through overachievement .
i got 15 minutes .
i assume your interrogation room is this way .
what can you tell us about victor delancy &apos;s girlfriend ?
i can tell you a lot of things about a lot of people .
specifics .
well , take you -- loyal husband , respected agent .
and you &apos;re virtually untouchable .
but the assistant u.s. attorney working the delancy case --
not so much from what i hear .
so you admit victor delancy &apos;s a client ?
oh , my clients expect anonymity . i admit nothing .
it &apos;s a game to her .
if i didn &apos;t know any better ,
i &apos;d think she senses my presence .
you call yourself an executive consultant .
what does that entail ?
i provide my clients with much @-@ needed structure .
something i see you could appreciate .
i &apos;m not following .
well , your tattoo .
squares syolize stability , foundation .
the line connecting them signifies companionship .
you must have been very much in love .
five years ago , i &apos;d say from the fading .
tattoos are forever .
love , i guess not so much so .
listen , you--
easy .
she &apos;s controlling the entire interview .
yeah , because peter &apos;s letting her .
he &apos;s playing to shepard &apos;s ego .
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
rumor has it you know some powerful people .
well , i rely on the people i know to get what i want ,
from the mayor to the man who washes my windows .
makes me wish we &apos;d met sooner .
i hit a rough patch here at the bureau a month or so back .
oh , that &apos;s a shame . i could have put in a good word for you .
with who ?
the mayor or the window washer ?
who do you think ?
i think your real skill is the art of the bluff ,
making claims you know full well you can &apos;t back up .
yes , landon shepard for the mayor .
hello , sir . landon shepard .
indeed , it has been some time .
well , we can confirm she &apos;s got a cell .
that &apos;s peter &apos;s play .
if it were registered under her real name , we &apos;d know about it .
for a subpoena , we &apos;d need either her alias --
or her cell number .
city hall phone logs are public record .
not bad , peter . not bad at all .
shall i say hi ?
no , thank you .
anything ?
well , good news is ,
we &apos;ve got shepard &apos;s phone records dating back nine years .
bad news ?
we &apos;ve got shepard &apos;s phone records dating back nine years .
no names , all outgoing numbers .
i mean , there must be thousands here .
and for the record , she was wrong about my tattoo .
i got it four years ago , not five .
okay .
keep focusing on calls made yesterday .
if we can establish a link between shepard and --
hold on .
you have something ?
yeah , this number .
there it is again .
her number is all over this thing .
isn &apos;t that
yeah .
sterling bosch has had shepard on retainer for years .
for what purposes ?
we &apos;re in the business of recovery .
if someone stands between us and something we want ,
she has the connections to make them roll over ,
and she is damn good at cleaning up messes .
such as ?
i may or may not have hired her
to retrieve my broken heel from ivanka trump &apos;s air vent .
don &apos;t ask .
so , you &apos;re aware of her methods .
she has very strict rules .
you tell her what you need , and she gets it done .
but if you question her means or even ask what they are ,
she will terminate the job .
don &apos;t ask how she gets her results , and she won &apos;t tell you .
peter , i know shepard isn &apos;t by the book ,
but i had no idea she &apos;d work for scum like delancy ,
let alone threaten the career of a federal prosecutor .
we know shepard works below board .
what if we can get her to incriminate herself ?
use it to leverage a confession .
yeah .
get her to admit that she &apos;s extorting bryson .
sara ...
how loyal is shepard to sterling bosch ?
very . why ?
i think i know a way we can use her own schemes against her .
you willing to help ?
for you ...
what do i do ?
miss shepard , hi .
thank you so much for calling me back .
sara , what can i do for you ?
well , i have a job offer for you
that &apos;s a bit sensitive in nature .
well , i &apos;m here to help .
my ex @-@ boyfriend , steve tabernackle ,
has some compromising photos of me and another man
that he &apos;s threatening to expose .
i can &apos;t convince him to destroy them ,
so i was hoping maybe you could .
well , this tabernackle sounds very unpleasant .
oh , unpleasant doesn &apos;t even begin to describe him .
he &apos;s a financial scammer , an ex @-@ con , a thief , a liar .
you get the picture .
is there anything else i should know ?
yes . most wednesdays ,
he plays high stakes pai gow on canal with a dozen ex @-@ felons --
clearly a violation of his parole .
maybe you can use that .
there &apos;s nothing a parolee hates more than prison .
so by this time tomorrow , i just need assurances
that those pictures will never see the light of day .
for one of my favorite clients , consider it done .
thank you so much , miss shepard .
it &apos;s a pleasure doing business with you .
so , once we catch her red @-@ handed trying to blackmail me ...
we flip her on delancy and strong @-@ arm a confession .
for the record ,
i am very much not the incriminating @-@ photos type .
well , there was ...
neal , i thought i was hitting speed dial .
right . all right .
what matters is that steve tabernackle &apos;s story
is backstopped as a parolee .
shepard can dig ,
but she won &apos;t link neal to the fbi .
back in steve &apos;s shoes .
sara , thank you for sacrificing
sterling bosch &apos;s ms. fix @-@ it .
just another day at white collar .
still no response from sam ?
could be anywhere .
diana has a contact in d.c.
he offered to run a search on a sam in the metro p.d. 30 years ago .
won &apos;t be easy without a ...
thanks ,
peter , but when sam &apos;s ready to talk ,
he knows how to find me .
what &apos;s going on ?
what do you mean ?
i just offered you a potential avenue to find sam ,
and you &apos;re telling me no .
i &apos;ve been thinking about the timing of ellen &apos;s death .
what about it ?
she &apos;s in witsec for close to three decades ,
and a few weeks after her name pops up in some fbi report --
you think whoever killed her had access ?
we can &apos;t rule that out .
if sam and i end up working together ,
i want you involved -- you know that .
only if i keep the investigation off @-@ book .
i never said that .
you didn &apos;t have to .
and will you ?
neal , i know you want answers , and i want to help .
but right now , i &apos;m in no position
to be breaking into another u @-@ boat .
i doubt this involves a submarine .
oh , no ?
maybe he &apos;s got a blimp .
okay . all right .
i get it .
i need you focusing on shepard .
someone who has no trouble working off @-@ book .
let me know if she contacts you .
i will .
good night , peter .
good night , neal .
oh , i see you cleaned house at pai gow .
i see you &apos;ve got a fake baby .
and a lead on our mysterious sam .
the gray suv pinged at zenith rent @-@ a @-@ car on varick .
that &apos;s great news . still doesn &apos;t explain the baby .
bartholomew helped me access their mainframe .
with his computer @-@ science degree ?
think of him as a swiss army knife .
that occasionally wets himself .
the suv &apos;s maintenance records .
credit @-@ card number for a samuel phelps .
moz , this is huge . thank you .
now , did you feel out the suit ?
i did .
and ?
and the last time he went off @-@ book for me ,
he almost lost his job .
until i know more ,
it &apos;s safer for everyone to keep peter out of this .
hello ?
mr. tabernackle ?
who is this ?
we &apos;ve never met , but we share a number of interests --
sara ellis , photography , gambling .
and if you &apos;re smart , you &apos;ll meet me in person to discuss them .
how does 10 : 00 a.m. tomorrow sound ?
i need you to get shepard on tape
explicitly telling you to --
to destroy the photos
or she &apos;ll release the dirt she &apos;s got on me .
i know a thing or two about avoiding blackmail .
you mean proving blackmail .
that &apos;s not what i said ?
remember , your questions can steer her answers .
yeah , like a con .
like testimony .
i &apos;ve got eyes on shepard .
here we go .
yeah .
mr. tabernackle .
what do you want ?
you have photos of sara ellis she &apos;d like destroyed .
i want you to make that happen .
and if i don &apos;t ?
i find out what kind of risk taker you are
when it comes to your friends .
where &apos;s she going with this ?
last night , one of steve tabernackle &apos;s suspected associates
went to great lengths to obtain this .
can you tell what it is ?
looks like an invoice of some sort .
that doesn &apos;t belong to you .
nor does it belong to the funny little bald man
who broke 15 laws trying to obtain it ,
3 of which involved
what i can only hope was a fake rubber child .
damn it . she wasn &apos;t following neal last night .
she was following mozzie .
now , why would someone go to such extraordinary lengths
for something so innocuous ?
i did some digging . it turns out --
i &apos;ll destroy the photos .
they &apos;ll never see the light of day .
you have my word .
what did he just do ?
he tanked it -- the whole damn thing .
shepard walks . we got nothing !
identity comes from family .
and those without family cherish their friendships .
your choice .
oh , i &apos;ll be holding on to this .
assurances and all .
it &apos;s been a pleasure .
you blew it , neal .
with a trial and a man &apos;s career at stake ,
you blew it .
if mozzie &apos;s name ends up in the fbi files ,
he &apos;s made .
i could have excluded his name from the official report .
you know that .
do i ?
that puts you off @-@ book .
is that what this is about ? neal , what &apos;s going on ?
what was on that piece of paper ?
something mozzie wouldn &apos;t want exposed .
that &apos;s all i can tell you . - neal --
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
get out of here . i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
of course that made the suit suspicious !
and the lady fixer made me . i can &apos;t believe she made me .
it &apos;s not your fault , moz . she &apos;s good .
no one is that good .
you know what this is ? too much time on the island .
i &apos;ve gone soft .
don &apos;t be ridiculous , okay ?
watch .
i once killed a man with this trick .
you never killed a man doing that .
i could have . once .
that &apos;s it .
i &apos;m gonna go to aruba and get my edge back .
before you go assassinating apples in aruba ,
how about you help me find a way to stop shepard ?
that i can still help you with . what are her weaknesses ?
well , she &apos;s a control freak .
she hates it when her clients question her methods .
and her strengths ?
well @-@ connected ...
good at reading people .
she has long @-@ term clients on the level of sterling bosch .
show @-@ off .
any way to use her strengths against her ?
i know how we can take bryson &apos;s extortion photos out of play .
i &apos;m all ears .
how would you feel about sleeping with sara ellis ?
do you have any idea what &apos;s this about ?
no . you ?
no clue .
why did i agree to this ? this is a terrible idea .
hey , if you have a better idea , i would love to hear it .
fine . but you should tell them .
it &apos;s your brilliant idea .
it &apos;s your wife .
it &apos;s your ex @-@ girlfriend .
oh , so you want me to control the narrative ?
let &apos;s tell them together .
great .
great . all right .
let &apos;s do it .
teamwork , right ?
yep . teamwork .
okay ? you and me .
yep .
i &apos;d like to start by saying this is neal &apos;s idea .
that peter supports 100 % .
okay . can one of you just please speak ?
well , it occurred to neal --
us . - us --
that if shepard were to drop delancy as a client ,
delancy &apos;s extortion scheme would go up in smoke .
and shepard would still have the photos of josh
but would have no incentive to use them .
exactly .
so how do we get shepard to drop delancy ?
by convincing delancy that i am still a threat to his freedom .
i had neal working undercover on this one .
using my alias at caplin ,
i &apos;ll give delancy dirt on peter that &apos;s so tempting ,
he &apos;ll insist shepard uses it .
shepard will refuse .
delancy won &apos;t take no for an answer .
she &apos;ll resent having her methods questioned ,
so they &apos;ll argue .
shepard will drop delancy as a client , and poof .
we &apos;ve neutralized the extortion threat against bryson .
and why wouldn &apos;t she use the dirt she has against you ?
out of her loyalty to her best client .
who &apos;s her best client ?
the insurance investigator
who &apos;s sleeping with your husband .
oh , uh -- it &apos;s --
no . no , no .
sara already told shepard
that there are compromising photos of her with another man out there .
you never mentioned who that man was .
which gives us creative license to make those photos real .
what ? - no , i mean --
not real , but look real . real @-@ looking .
and you can completely be there .
in the photos ?
no , no . i &apos;m just saying that you can watch .
oh , &apos; cause that won &apos;t be awkward .
i hate to say it , but i think it &apos;ll work .
yeah , as long as the photos are ... convincing .
okay . by &quot; convincing , &quot; you mean ...
i &apos;m talking about showing a little skin .
a state of tasteful undress .
where do you do this ?
honey , you sure you want to be here ?
if you &apos;re sure you &apos;re doing this ,
i &apos;m sure i want to be here .
i love you .
neal , how do you want this ?
it &apos;s like -- it &apos;s like you just stumbled in from dinner .
you &apos;re a little drunk .
but , you know , most importantly ...
you &apos;re burning with desire .
god , that &apos;s what i get for asking .
what do we do ? do we just wing this ?
wing it !
yeah . yeah , let &apos;s just wing it .
yeah . wing it .
okay .
all right .
okay .
seriously ?
okay , i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i &apos;ve got to stop you .
i feel like a limo driver on prom night .
you want to leave ?
no . honey , i want you to get into it .
come on ! you &apos;re an intense , sexy man .
show her what you got . come on .
all right . okay .
yeah , sara , just maybe --
you know , maybe loosen it up a little bit .
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
it needs to look passionate .
what , is this better ? whoa .
yeah . yeah , yeah .
that &apos;s good , right ?
okay .
that &apos;s -- oh -- - there . all right .
this is weird .
honey , put left hand down a little further , further .
lower ?
yeah , there you go .
sara , do that thing with your leg .
neal , i got it !
sara , maybe you could put your head back .
back ?
okay . yeah , there you go .
there you go . wow . okay , that &apos;s good .
that &apos;s hot .
romance @-@ novel cover , right there .
whisper in his ear . he likes that at home .
oh , hi , peter .
yeah , yeah , yeah . that &apos;s good . okay .
lift her up . lift her . oh .
yeah , there you go . lean back .
that &apos;s good .
a little further . a little further , yeah .
careful .
okay .
i think we got it .
that &apos;s a wrap .
there &apos;s my scientist guy .
good to see house arrest hasn &apos;t cramped your style , delancy .
alcott .
hey , i heard through the grapevine
that , uh , burke roughed you up pretty good last night .
yeah , that son of a bitch tried to turn me .
he says he knows i offered to look the other way
so you could taint the samples .
he &apos;s after that missing benzene .
damn it .
yeah . well , lucky for us ...
he &apos;s no angel .
busted .
i love it !
look , i helped you out .
i was hoping you could help me , too .
i got somebody that can take care of this .
are you sure ? &apos; cause i cannot lose my job .
no , no , no . i got it .
honey ?
yeah , babe .
shepard &apos;s here . you want me to let her in ?
sure , hon .
hey , speak of the devil , stick around .
i &apos;ll introduce you to her .
you know , i would , but i &apos;m late for an appointment .
i &apos;ll see you .
all right .
he &apos;s in the back .
i didn &apos;t appreciate the tone of your voicemail last night .
i told you , you chose the wrong target .
you &apos;re days away from becoming a free man , thanks to me .
not if burke &apos;s got something to do with it .
i thought you said he was untouchable .
where did you get these ?
buddy at caplin environmental .
i want them in play .
these photos will not see the light of day .
why not ?
that &apos;s none of your concern .
you work for me .
you tell burke to stop digging around ,
or these will go public .
nobody tells me how to do my job .
you do it , or i will . you hear me ?
goodbye , delancy . we &apos;re done .
you &apos;re on your own .
hey . what ? we had a deal , right ?
i make the rules .
you don &apos;t question them . that was our deal .
and i &apos;m taking these with me .
no , you &apos;re not .
if you touch me or these photos ,
i &apos;ll make sure that burke does find that vial .
hey , peter .
you tell josh the good news ?
yeah , extortion photos are off the table ,
but it may be too little too late .
why ? what happened ?
defense rested an hour ago .
they obliterated peter &apos;s testimony .
without hard proof the benzene existed ,
there is no way i can get a guilty verdict .
what if we can get you that proof ?
what are you talking about ?
shepard never destroyed delancy &apos;s vial of benzene .
she &apos;s holding it over his head .
why ?
the evidence against mozzie ,
the pictures of you and sara --
she holds on to everything .
it &apos;s the only way she can control her client .
which means the vial is only good to her
if it &apos;s well @-@ preserved , complete with delancy &apos;s fingerprints .
it &apos;d have to be submitted by the time court resumes at 3 : 00 .
that &apos;s less than two hours .
we need to figure out how to find it .
how can you stall ?
well , the defense claims that the vial never existed ,
but what if you called one last rebuttal witness
who happens to know that it did ?
the only other person who saw the vial .
neal caffrey , how &apos;d you like to take the stand ?
you &apos;re on the stand at 3 : 00 .
defense assumes your testimony
will do me more harm than good .
good . low expectations .
yeah , but if we don &apos;t find that benzene , they may be right .
any word from peter ?
yeah , he &apos;s got all of white collar flagging banks ,
storage facilities , and warehouses from shepard &apos;s call logs .
no leads yet ,
but there are still a few hundred private numbers he &apos;s looking into .
a few hundred ?
well , we brought in some extra help .
limo service , limo service ,
comptroller , comptroller , giuliani .
by the way , giuliani never returns my phone calls anymore .
momofuku , momofuku .
where did you come from ?
45 years ago , an enigma gave a paradox a very special hug .
wait a minute .
shepard calls the same number on the second of every month .
what is it ?
storage facility in midtown .
unpublished , for clients only .
you &apos;re a client ?
unpublished , for clients only .
i think we may have found our benzene .
neal takes the stand in less than an hour .
not enough time for a warrant .
although , if we could somehow convince shepard
to get the vial out of storage ...
you can catch her red @-@ handed .
suit , i like the way you &apos;re thinking .
what did she catch you doing the other night ?
irrelevant .
this is about payback , right ?
do you want my help or not ?
i do .
but nothing illegal , and it stays aboveboard .
what if i could arrange for you to be aboveboard ?
plausible deniability ?
it &apos;s worked for us before .
let &apos;s do it .
we &apos;re here . what &apos;s next ?
okay .
here .
my parisian audio diary , circa march 1983 .
max volume .
okay , uh , face west .
no , i @-@ i mean east .
strangers turned up in my apartment again .
it happens most nights now .
the first time , i opened the door , so i can understand .
but now they just push past the gate .
miss shepard . lenny from raylan .
we &apos;re dealing with kind of a pipe @-@ burst situation over here ,
and we &apos;re consulting our clients
to remove their belongings before they get damaged .
i must always have a bottle of red
and a bottle of white on hand ,
and sometimes they want a card game .
look , it &apos;s -- oh ! jeffrey , no ! no ! oh , no !
&quot; you , &quot; i say , &quot; you &apos;re next door to the spanish .
&quot; if new jersey spoke french ,
perhaps then i would have picked some up . &quot;
you can borrow it anytime to hear the rest .
what &apos;s next ?
okay , i need you to go down to loco jerry &apos;s .
order an empanada -- sin queso --
then wait in the car .
do not eat it .
and no matter what you see or hear ,
do not exit the vehicle until shepard is inside that building .
or you can just stay here and watch us work .
i &apos;ll get the empanada .
we &apos;ve closed the court , mr. bryson .
are you or are you not prepared to call your witness ?
your honor , the prosecution would like to call
mr. neal caffrey to the stand .
he &apos;s an eyewitness to the benzene vial
the defense claims never existed .
what ?
come on , mozzie .
whatever you &apos;re up to ...
jones , diana , get ready to move .
would you state your full name and title for the court ?
neal george caffrey , cooperating witness
and confidential informant for the fbi .
fbi ?
mr. caffrey , why were you sent undercover ?
well , it &apos;s a bit of a long story .
we have time .
what you doing , shepard ?
agent burke .
didn &apos;t peg you as the type to flood private property ,
though i do know that you &apos;d never cheat on your wife .
it &apos;s so interesting to see where one chooses to draw the line .
if you knew those photos were staged ,
why &apos;d you play along ?
because delancy &apos;s a temperamental idiot
and i respect sara ellis .
she wants you behind bars .
no . she doesn &apos;t .
but you made her choose a side .
i blame you for that , not her .
time for payback .
drill , baby , drill .
vial &apos;s in the trunk .
cuff me , agent .
with pleasure .
i &apos;m curious .
how does a man who &apos;s chosen
to uphold the law explain this ?
what happened here ?
long story .
watch her . i &apos;m gonna check the trunk .
looks like your spell &apos;s been broken .
make you a deal .
verify the chain of custody on that vial ,
and maybe we &apos;ll go a little easier on you .
i can work with that .
everything okay , peter ?
yeah . we all got what we needed .
i got to get this to the courthouse .
well , barty , looks like we got our edge back .
and giuliani has a reason to return my calls .
mr. caffrey , the vial the defendant showed you --
what size would you say it was ?
objection !
your honor , asked and answered .
sustained . mr. bryson ,
you &apos;ve covered the ground you need to cover .
either allow the defense to cross @-@ examine the witness or --
hey ! where do you think you &apos;re going ? !
mr. caffrey , is this the vial victor delancy showed you
on november 1st of last year ?
i believe it is .
mr. caffrey , for two weeks ,
you worked as a highly successful senior biochemical analyst
at caplin environmental .
objection .
how does being a fake scientist
qualified this man to identify benzene ?
i &apos;d very much like an answer to that myself .
your honor , i was convicted of bond forgery .
forgery is as much science as it is art .
and does the government consider you
an expert in forgery ?
of all types --
art , bonds , checks .
would you please explain to the court
what check washing is ?
check washing is the process
of dissolving the ink from a check ,
allowing it to be rewritten for any amount .
and how is that accomplished ?
well , typically , the check is soaked in benzene .
so , not only is benzene a toxic pollutant ,
it &apos;s also a chemical criminals use
to remove ink from a personal check ?
that &apos;s correct .
mr. caffrey , when you &apos;re known in some circles
as a con man and a liar ,
why should we believe a word of any of this ?
oh , you shouldn &apos;t . people lie .
but science doesn &apos;t .
he &apos;s not a scientist .
ladies and gentlemen , i present to you exhibit 64a .
as confirmed by agent burke , mr. caffrey ,
and verified through the chain of custody ,
we now know this is the vial removed from delancy &apos;s office
november 6th of last year .
can you please demonstrate for the court
how science can prove this vial contains benzene ?
absolutely .
uh , your honor , i &apos;ll need your pen , please .
and the defendant &apos;s glass of water .
thank you , sir .
i guess i was thirsty .
let the record show that i am writing a check
to george alcott -- great guy , sharp as a tack --
in the amount of $ 100 .
now , if the liquid in this vial is benzene ,
the ink from this check will disappear completely
within five seconds of contact .
pardon the fumes .
all right .
here we go .
four , three , two ...
five seconds . give or take , apparently .
let the record show ,
where the check was submerged ,
the ink has vanished completely .
ours is a fact @-@ driven process .
you know , i &apos;d like to thank those who gathered those facts ,
as well as the jury for weighing them
and arriving at the right conclusion .
glad to see my science lesson
had a positive effect on the jury .
bryson mentioned the woods trial is coming up .
he &apos;d love to have you .
i think i &apos;ll pass .
testifying &apos;s fun ,
but it &apos;s not as much of a con as i thought .
telling the whole truth isn &apos;t your cup of tea ?
i &apos;m shocked .
listen , i got an errand to run . do you mind if i --
go . i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
see ya .
your c.i.
i should have known .
shepard , how the hell did you get out ?
the judge released me on my own recognizance .
it &apos;s amazing what knowing the right people can get you .
yes , it is .
oh , and my compliments on a game well played .
extortion &apos;s a game to you ?
of course .
oh , and your strategy -- staying above the law
while the people around you break it --
it &apos;s genius .
well , sometimes we have to do things we don &apos;t like
to protect the people we care about .
are you talking about bryson or your boy caffrey ?
he &apos;s slippery ,
and so is the line between right and wrong .
and when you follow him across it ,
it will cost you everything .
i hope i &apos;m wrong .
but if i &apos;m not ... call me .
i &apos;m here to help .
if you think you can find ellen &apos;s evidence without me ...
you &apos;re wrong .
why is that ?
cause i &apos;m standing here talking to a man
who doesn &apos;t want to be found .
sam , no one wants these guys taken down more than me .
i spent the last decade of my life hiding from the truth .
i &apos;m finally ready to face it ,
and i &apos;ll be damned if i &apos;m turning back now
because you think i can &apos;t help you .
no fbi ?
no fbi .
your father and i used to play darts once in a while .
he hated losing with a passion .
like father , like son .
darts , huh ?
so what now ?
we stay in touch ...
we share information ...
and we do whatever it takes to bring them down .
neal , what are you doing ?
