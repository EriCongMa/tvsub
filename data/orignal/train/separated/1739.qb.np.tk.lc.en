第七季 第十七集
raj , your tag is sticking out .
thank you . that was the closest i &apos;ve come to sex
in , like , two years .
now i feel a little gross .
you &apos;re only making it seem more real for me .
hey , that &apos;s my wife .
if anyone &apos;s gonna make her feel gross about sex , it &apos;s me .
can we please talk about something
other than my depressing love life ?
how about penny &apos;s depressing acting career ?
i mean , it &apos;s been a little tough ,
but penny &apos;s following her dreams ,
and in my book , that is not depressing .
aw ... thank you .
is that book called lies i tell to get sex ?
is that a real book ?
i would totally read that book .
can i borrow it when you &apos;re done ?
well , i &apos;ll have you guys know
i turned down a part in a movie last week .
why would you do that ?
because it was crap .
it &apos;s a sequel to that awful
killer gorilla movie i was in .
serial ape @-@ ist ?
i thought you died in that .
she does .
42 minutes in .
while showering topless ,
16 minutes after brief side butt
during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters .
i have an eidetic memory .
i don &apos;t know what his problem is .
okay , well , there are no shower scenes in this one .
they just try to clone me from my corpse ,
but my dna gets mixed with the ape &apos;s dna
and i end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet .
am i missing something ,
or isn &apos;t that the part she was born to play ?
so are you really not gonna do this movie ?
well , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s the kind of part
that &apos;s good for my career .
well , but don &apos;t a lot of famous actors
get their start doing bad movies ?
okay , i don &apos;t think meryl streep ever had to say ...
&quot; must keep gorilla hands from killing again ! &quot;
if she did , it would be amazing .
that woman can do no wrong .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know anything about show business ,
so if you think it &apos;s reasonable to turn down paid work
and just burn through your savings ,
i &apos;m sure you know what you &apos;re doing .
i think we &apos;re gonna go .
are you sure ?
we were making fun of failed careers .
we didn &apos;t get to tap the juicy vein that is howard &apos;s .
hey , i work at the same university you do .
yes , and hawkeye &apos;s in the avengers ,
but no one ever says , &quot; help , hawkeye ! &quot;
can i ask you something ?
why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband ?
oh , i &apos;m sure he does it out of love .
the same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible
about my life choices .
i think we &apos;re gonna go .
no , no , no . this is not a fight .
i @-@ i was just excited that someone offered you a part
and a little surprised that you &apos;d rather sit at home
and do nothing than take it .
now it &apos;s a fight .
well , with that sorted out ,
i &apos;m happy to answer your question , bernadette .
howard started it .
i didn &apos;t do anything . i was just sitting here .
i wasn &apos;t referring to this evening .
ten years ago , upon first seeing me ,
your husband claimed that i looked like c @-@ 3po
and pee @-@ wee herman .
与谢尔顿外形有些神似
and he called me c @-@ 3p @-@ wee herman .
still funny .
that was ten years ago .
nine years , 11 months and three weeks ago ,
he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture
with photographs of nude fat women bending over .
really ?
the lecture was on cosmic gas clouds .
that &apos;s funny !
i was there . it was funny .
in any event , that began a decade @-@ long progression
of insults , pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions .
to this day , i still get a monthly copy
of granny on granny .
which , other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page ,
is complete filth .
thanks for walking me to my car .
actually , it &apos;s for both of us .
last night , i watched west side story ,
and i &apos;m a little freaked out by street gangs .
why can &apos;t raj find a girl ?
the mystery continues .
i don &apos;t appreciate your sarcasm ,
but we &apos;ve still got two blocks to go , so i &apos;ll put up with it .
whatever happened with your online dating ?
no one was writing me back , so i stopped checking my profile .
before i met sheldon , i was ready to give up , too .
once , i even dropped in on my ob / gyn
just to get some human contact .
it has been a while since i got my prostate checked .
then i met sheldon and look at where we are now .
what ? you &apos;ve kissed , like , once in three years .
that &apos;s true . do whatever you want .
hello .
listen , i was thinking you and i could
probably try to be better friends .
really ?
i was thinking what we have now is a bit much .
seriously , i was talking to bernadette last night and ...
she made some great points .
you and i have known each other a long time ,
and i didn &apos;t hear the rest &apos; cause she took her bra off .
very well .
how do you propose we move forward ?
uh , for starters , we could stop insulting each other .
that &apos;s a great idea .
and in the spirit of our new arrangement ,
i will mask my surprise that you came up with it .
anyway , i got invited to do a little talk at nasa
in houston this weekend .
they gave me two tickets . bernadette can &apos;t go .
you want to come with me ?
you can visit your mom ,
and i &apos;ll show you around the space center .
i have one question .
is this a prank ...
where we land in houston
and you &apos;ve made up wanted posters
that have my face with a mustache and a spanish name
and then i get arrested and deported to south america ?
no .
i &apos;m glad because i would not have seen that coming .
amy , i could use some help .
oh . let me guess . there &apos;s an ...
undergrad in a leather jacket
snapping his fingers by the water fountain .
i thought about what you said last night ,
and i went back on the dating web site
and i was looking at this girl &apos;s profile .
she &apos;s amazing .
oh , she &apos;s cute .
and smart . phi beta kappa .
and judging by her lack of adam &apos;s apple ,
she &apos;s been female her entire life .
i like that in a woman .
great , so what do you need me for ?
well , i was up all night trying to write to her ,
but i wanted to run it by you first .
all right .
&quot; emily ,
your face is like a precious dew @-@ kissed flower ... &quot;
i know . powerful stuff , huh ?
no .
you &apos;re supposed to be yourself , not all ...
desperate and creepy .
okay , i &apos;m getting some mixed messages here .
just say something normal like , &quot; i saw your profile .
looks like we have a lot in common ;
let &apos;s get a cup of coffee sometime . &quot;
yes .
&quot; where i can be jealous of the cup
touching your ruby lips . &quot;
or you just write it for me .
i &apos;m not gonna pretend to be you .
i don &apos;t want you to pretend to be me .
you can be like my , uh , online wingman .
like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up .
well , what would i say to her ?
just tell her what i &apos;m really like .
and , if you think it &apos;ll help ,
that you saw me changing once
and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar .
use your own words .
thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy .
oh , it &apos;s no problem . is everything okay ?
oh , i &apos;m fine . it &apos;s just some , uh ,
stomach medication for my trip .
there &apos;s the remote yet distinct possibility
that i may end up in south america .
remember the old days when i would &apos;ve said something dumb
like &quot; why ? &quot;
uh , that doesn &apos;t sound good .
remember the old days when i used to point out
that your check engine light was on ?
yes .
well , get ready to stroll down memory lane :
penny , your check engine ...
yeah , i know it &apos;s on , sheldon !
oh , no , no , no , no , no .
i cannot afford this right now .
maybe it &apos;s just something minor .
ooh , good news , the light just went out .
are we playing individual or teams ?
teams are fun .
oh , in that case , i &apos;d like to be partnered
with my good friend howard .
but i &apos;m always on howard &apos;s team .
we &apos;re best friends .
the kind who finish each others ...
i really don &apos;t think we do tha ...
... do that ! see ?
oh , how &apos;d it go at the mechanic ?
not great . can i talk to you for a sec ?
yeah , sure .
maybe i can go with you guys to houston ?
isn &apos;t it a little late to get plane tick ...
... plane tickets ? yeah .
will you please sto ...
... stop that ? okay .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
my car threw a rod and it &apos;s totaled .
i can &apos;t afford a new one , i have no job ,
and now i can &apos;t drive to auditions .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i know it &apos;s a sensitive subject ,
but can you reconsider that part in the movie ?
i did . i called them . the part &apos;s gone .
they gave it to someone else .
now that girl &apos;s gonna get discovered and become famous
and go on letterman and talk about
how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie
all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her .
at least they talked about you on letterman .
come on , i can drive you wherever you need to go .
how ? unlike me , you have a job .
i &apos;m just gonna have to go back to being a waitress ...
... like i will be for the rest of my life .
leonard , would you wrap it up ?
we &apos;re waiting on you .
i &apos;m sorry , is the fact that my life &apos;s falling apart
interfering with your board game ?
it is .
you were wrong , friend howard .
she completely understood .
hey , you busy ?
no . what &apos;s up ?
have you heard back from emily ?
i have .
great ! and ?
and i &apos;m afraid she doesn &apos;t think you &apos;re right for her .
i give you one simple thing to do--
contact a complete stranger
and make her fall in love with me--
and you blow it !
i told her what a good guy you are , but
she thought it was a bad sign
that you didn &apos;t write to her yourself .
she thought it made you seem too shy and passive .
i &apos;m not too shy and passive .
you write her back and tell her i said that .
you know , when you have a second .
look , i &apos;ll see if i can change her mind tomorrow night .
what &apos;s happening tomorrow night ?
i &apos;m meeting her for coffee .
what ? !
well , we just ... we e @-@ mailed back and forth a bit ,
and we kind of hit it off .
i find a girl i like , and you &apos;re stealing her ? !
no .
we just ended up having a lot in common .
we went to harvard , we like chaucer ,
we &apos;re both hardcore into quilting .
your words fall like acid rain
on the wounded petals of my heart .
that &apos;s sheldon .
he says he &apos;ll be down in a minute .
what are you doing ?
oh , he &apos;s not coming out until he sees proof
you don &apos;t have an air freshener in your car .
this is gonna be a long weekend for you .
you &apos;re the reason i &apos;m doing it !
i said to stop insulting each other .
i didn &apos;t tell you to take him on a romantic getaway .
how do i know what you said ?
damn you and your noise @-@ cancelling breasts .
hello .
hi .
hey , buddy .
you excited for texas ?
oh , very much so .
it &apos;s not every day you get to tour nasa with a real astronaut .
who &apos;s the real astronaut ?
buzz aldrin .
oh . yay !
howard ?
howard ?
howard ?
what now ?
i have to go to the bathroom .
you just went to the bathroom .
i didn &apos;t use it because it didn &apos;t seem safe .
despite all my e @-@ mails , the toilet didn &apos;t have a seatbelt .
well , it still doesn &apos;t .
i realize that , but safety concerns went out the window
two apple juices ago .
fine .
why are you getting annoyed ?
i &apos;m trying to be a better friend ,
but you constantly say and do irritating things .
like when ?
when ? !
how about in the car ?
i &apos;m an astronaut , and you know it .
you just don &apos;t like admitting it , because you &apos;re jealous .
well , truth be told ,
as a child , i did dream of going to space .
those astronauts were my heroes .
and ...
when you got to go , it was hard for me .
thank you .
because it made me realize
they &apos;ll just send anyone up there .
aren &apos;t you going to let me out ?
no .
but i still need to use the bathroom .
here you go . be creative .
what &apos;s the matter ? scared of a little turbulence ?
no , turbulence is just the equalization
of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere .
i &apos;m not scared at all .
oh , apple juice , stay where you are .
oh , this is nothing .
i experienced way worse
when i was plummeting back to earth ,
apparently not being a real astronaut .
okay , that was a big one .
i take it back . i &apos;m scared of turbulence !
i &apos;m gonna need that bag back .
you sure you want to do this ?
yeah . why wouldn &apos;t i want to get my old job back ?
it &apos;ll be fun to see everyone .
i haven &apos;t talked to them since i said ,
&quot; i quit . see you at the oscars , bitches . &quot;
come on , let &apos;s just get this over with .
&quot; let &apos;s get this over with . &quot;
am i driving you to the cheesecake factory ,
or are we having sex ?
i &apos;m just ... i &apos;m trying to lighten the mood .
i know . thank you .
sorry .
it &apos;s just so humiliating .
so humiliating ?
am i driving you to the cheesecake factory ... ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll stop . i &apos;ll stop .
come on , don &apos;t look so sad .
you never know what &apos;s gonna happen .
maybe tonight will be great .
sweetie , i know you &apos;re trying to make me feel better ,
and i love you for that ,
but it &apos;s making me feel worse , and i kind of hate you .
this isn &apos;t your car .
i know . i thought we &apos;d take yours .
i don &apos;t understand .
it &apos;s nothing fancy , but it &apos;ll get you to auditions ,
and at least for now , you don &apos;t have to go back to waitressing .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
don &apos;t say anything .
oh , my god .
i mean , you could say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
i did just buy you a car .
look , i admit that it &apos;s odd
that rajesh didn &apos;t write to you himself ,
but if you get to know him ,
you &apos;ll see he &apos;s just a sweet , regular guy .
as a counterpoint , here he is ,
uninvited and visibly sweaty .
hello , emily .
hello .
amy told me you were concerned that
i might be too passive and shy .
let me ask you something .
would a passive guy barge in here
to look you in the eye and say ,
&quot; hey , dew @-@ kissed flower , what &apos;s up ? &quot;
no , but a weird guy with no boundaries might .
uh , okay , that &apos;s a separate issue .
let &apos;s put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing .
i &apos;m leaving .
are we still going to go to that chaucer reading friday ?
you know , i think i &apos;m just gonna go by myself .
not my best first date .
yeah , but not my worst , either .
i &apos;m sorry for every mean thing i ever did or said to you !
i &apos;m sorry , too ! it &apos;s all my fault !
if you weren &apos;t my friend ,
there &apos;d be a hole in my life !
thank you , sheldon .
kind of like when firefly was cancelled .
but not as big .
the captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign .
you &apos;re now free to move about the cabin .
it &apos;s over .
yeah .
should we stop holding hands now ?
in a minute .
okay , good .
