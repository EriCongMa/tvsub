yeah , i miss you , too , sweetie .
listen , i got to go , but i &apos;ll see you tonight ?
okay . bye @-@ bye . bye @-@ bye .
no , you hang up first .
hello ?
dude , i &apos;m glad you finally got a girlfriend ,
but do you have to do all that lovey @-@ dovey stuff
in front of those of us who don &apos;t ?
actually , he might have to .
there &apos;s an economic concept known as a positional good
in which an object is only valued by the possessor
because it &apos;s not possessed by others .
the term was coined in 1976 by economist fred hirsch
to replace the more colloquial , but less precise &quot; neener @-@ neener . &quot;
that &apos;s not true .
my happiness is not dependent
on my best friend being miserable and alone .
thank you .
although , i &apos;d be lying if i said it wasn &apos;t a little bit of a perk .
who &apos;s miserable and alone ?
me .
i used to be like that . then i got a girlfriend .
in pre @-@ 1976 terms , neener @-@ neener .
hey , what are you and bernadette doing for your first valentine &apos;s day ?
yeah , i am pulling out all the stops .
there &apos;s a $ 39.95 lover &apos;s special at p.f. chang &apos;s .
egg rolls , dumplings ,
bottomless wok , and you get your picture taken
on the big marble horse out front .
given that saint valentine was a third century roman priest
who was stoned and beheaded ,
wouldn &apos;t a more appropriate celebration of the evening
be taking one &apos;s steady gal to witness a brutal murder ?
i understand your point , but given a choice ,
jews always go with chinese food .
well , if anyone &apos;s interested ,
i &apos;ll be spending this valentine &apos;s day
the same way i spend every valentine &apos;s day .
buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket ,
taking it home , standing over the sink
and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal .
okay , so to sum up : one giant marble horse ,
one asinine comment , one lonely man and his chicken .
and let &apos;s see . who &apos;s left ?
oh , that &apos;s right . my plans .
isn &apos;t anyone going to ask ?
fine , tell us you &apos;re going to have sex with penny .
that &apos;s not what i was going to tell you .
it &apos;s okay . i don &apos;t mind hearing about your sex life .
it &apos;s his that bugs me .
guess who the university is sending to switzerland
to attend a conference and see the cern supercollider
on february 14 ?
professor norton , although , god knows why .
he hasn &apos;t published anything of note
since he won that nobel prize .
actually , professor norton can &apos;t make it .
he threw his back out rock climbing .
i heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend .
the big @-@ boobed weather girl on channel 2 ?
that &apos;s the one .
in any case , they &apos;re asking me to fill in for him .
in switzerland or with the big @-@ boobed weather girl ?
switzerland .
and i get to bring a guest !
oh , man ! no way , dude !
this is incredible !
i &apos;m so happy ,
i &apos;m not even going to question their judgment in picking you .
i &apos;m just going to run home and start packing .
why wouldn &apos;t you take penny ?
i am taking penny .
well , then i anticipate an awkward situation when you get home .
sheldon , you got a minute ?
of course , my good friend .
come in .
help me out .
which ski hat says aprey supercollider ?
sheldon , i &apos;m not taking you to switzerland .
well , of course you are .
who else would you take ?
penny .
what ? that &apos;s absurd .
penny has no interest in subatomic particle research .
yes , but it &apos;ll be valentine &apos;s day .
we can go sightseeing and skiing
and make love in front of a roaring fire
in the shadow of the snowcapped alps .
but penny has no interest in subatomic particle research .
i &apos;m sorry , sheldon .
sorry ?
i &apos;ve been dreaming about going to the large hadron collider
since i was nine years old .
yeah , well , i &apos;ve been dreaming about spending valentine &apos;s day
with a girl since i was six .
shame on you !
that &apos;s no dream for a scientist !
okay , what &apos;s the big surprise ?
just a minute .
this tray contains clues
as to what you and i are going to be doing on valentine &apos;s day .
oh . wow . okay .
let &apos;s see .
we &apos;ve got , uh , milk chocolate ,
swiss cheese , fondue .
my lactose @-@ intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this .
then i &apos;m going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon ?
no .
but it does involve air travel .
okay , um ...
let me slice this swiss cheese with my swiss army knife ,
and then you can wash it down with a cup of swiss miss instant cocoa .
okay , i &apos;m starting to think swiss is key here .
uh @-@ huh .
we &apos;re going to disneyland and ride the matterhorn ?
how does that involve air travel ?
we &apos;re going to disney world and ride the matterhorn ?
no .
okay , sweetie , this started out fun , but i &apos;m over it .
we &apos;re going to switzerland
to see the cern supercollider !
and ski . we &apos;ll also go skiing .
we &apos;re going skiing in switzerland ? !
well , you &apos;ll ski , i &apos;ll fall , but , yeah ,
we will be in switzerland for valentine &apos;s day .
oh , my god , leonard ! that &apos;s incredible !
not so fast .
you might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli , penny .
rabe @-@ what @-@ ly ?
rabeliechtli . it means turnip light
and refers to a traditional lantern hand @-@ carved from a root vegetable
and used to celebrate certain swiss festivals .
which you will not be celebrating
because a : these festivals occur in the fall ;
and b :
you will not be going to switzerland .
sheldon , we &apos;ve been through this .
i &apos;m taking penny .
afraid not . do you recognize this ?
not the roommate agreement .
indeed , the roommate agreement .
i call your attention to the friendship rider
in appendix c : future commitments .
&quot; number 37 : in the event one friend is ever invited
&quot; to visit the large hadron collider ,
&quot; now under construction in switzerland ,
he shall invite the other friend to accompany him . &quot;
oh , for god &apos;s sakes .
you actually put that in an agreement ?
yeah . we also put in what happens
if one of us wins a macarthur grant ,
or if one of us gets superpowers ,
or if one of us is bitten by a zombie .
he can &apos;t kill me , even if i turn .
is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend ?
no , that seemed a little farfetched .
sheldon , do you really expect to enforce this ?
i &apos;ve lived up
to all my commitments under the agreement .
at least once a day i ask how you are ,
even though i simply don &apos;t care .
i no longer
stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 : 00 p.m.
and i abandoned my goal to master tuvan throat singing .
okay , i know i shouldn &apos;t ask , but what is ... ?
no .
i &apos;d be much further along if i &apos;d been allowed to practice .
look , sheldon , i know it &apos;s in the agreement ,
and if you turn into a zombie , i promise i will not kill you .
in fact , i &apos;ll even let you eat my brains .
but i am taking penny to switzerland .
is that your final decision ?
it is .
very well .
it &apos;s not over , is it ?
what do you think ?
got a bit of traffic this morning , huh ?
think it &apos;s gonna rain ?
instead of underpants ,
i covered my crotch with potato salad this morning .
thoughts ?
okay , i know what &apos;ll cheer you up .
let &apos;s play one of your driving games .
all right .
this game is called traitors .
i will name three historical figures ,
you put them in order
of the heinousness of their betrayal .
benedict arnold , judas , dr. leonard hofstadter .
you really think i belong with benedict arnold and judas ?
you &apos;re right .
judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did .
come on , sheldon . can &apos;t you at least try to understand
how much this means to me ?
round two : leonard hofstadter ,
darth vader , rupert murdoch .
rupert murdoch ?
he owns fox , and they cancelled firefly .
hint : he and darth vader are tied for # 2 .
i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t hang with you last night .
i had a date with bernadette .
i know .
i saw the tweet .
so , what did you end up doing ?
not much .
nuked a burrito . oh .
prayed to the hindu god urvashi that your bowels would loosen
and your penis would droop like a willow tree .
you seen sheldon ?
no . is he still mad about the supercollider ?
yeah . he thinks i betrayed him .
i mean , come on . what would you guys do if you were me ?
i &apos;d take sheldon to switzerland .
seriously ?
absolutely .
and i &apos;d leave him there .
what the hell is that ?
uh , let &apos;s see .
30 pieces of silverware .
grieg &quot; peer gynt - morning &quot;
morning , old chum .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;ve made you breakfast .
juice , coffee ,
and pancakes in the shape of some
of your favorite fictional characters .
see , here &apos;s frodo .
you made frodo pancakes ?
yeah , i used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet .
if you need to void your bladder before eating ,
i can keep them warm with this beret
that i thoroughly laundered
and pressed into service as a pancake cozy .
why are you doing this ?
it &apos;s by way of an apology for my recent behavior .
i &apos;ve had some time to reflect and i &apos;ve come to realize
that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements .
it &apos;s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other .
butterscotch scone ?
thanks .
it &apos;s good .
what you &apos;re tasting is respect and affection .
and about a pound of crisco .
after you &apos;ve finished breakfast , i thought we could spend the day
watching the final season of babylon 5 with director commentary .
you hate babylon 5 .
i do . it fails as drama / science fiction ,
and it &apos;s hopelessly derivative .
but you like it , and you &apos;re my friend .
okay , great .
still not taking you to switzerland .
drat .
no frodo for you .
hello .
hello .
all right , let &apos;s dispense with the friendly banter .
i believe you know why i &apos;m here .
well , i always figured it was to study us ,
discover our weaknesses ,
and report back to your alien overlords .
yes , amusing .
extraordinary intelligence
might well appear extraterrestrial to you ,
but let me be more specific .
i believe you know why i &apos;m here in the laundry room .
better acoustics for your throat singing ?
it &apos;s actually not bad .
but my true purpose in being here
will be revealed in this brief powerpoint presentation .
lights .
why sheldon cooper , phd , should go to switzerland
to see the cern supercollider :
a powerpoint presentation by sheldon cooper , phd .
oh , for god &apos;s sake .
here we have a highly gifted researcher
in the field of particle physics
whose work has brought him to the precipice
of forever changing mankind &apos;s understanding of the universe .
aka me .
and here we have a waitress
brushing her teeth with her finger .
aka you .
i &apos;m sorry .
is this supposed to be buttering me up ?
please hold all questions till the end of the presentation .
this is the large hadron collider
at cern in switzerland ,
the product of decades of planning and construction .
it is a mecca for physicists the world over .
this is bath and body works
on colorado boulevard .
they sell scented soaps and lotions ,
some of which contain glitter .
now , let &apos;s see if we can match the individual
to the appropriate destination .
o @-@ kay .
show &apos;s over .
no , it &apos;s not .
i &apos;ve got five more slides .
sheldon , this is leonard &apos;s decision .
he invited me to switzerland , and i intend to go .
very well .
enjoy yourself .
you &apos;re going to be in the presence of something
that i &apos;ve dreamed of seeing for decades .
i just hope you &apos;ll be able to appreciate
the magnitude of where you are and what it represents .
i &apos;ll talk to leonard .
you will ?
yes .
if it means that much to you , you should go .
oh , penny , thank you !
you &apos;re welcome .
since i rarely hug ,
i &apos;m relying on your expertise regarding duration .
i think we &apos;re there .
oh , good .
bye @-@ bye .
you know what ?
even though i don &apos;t have a girlfriend ,
i can still have a good time on valentine &apos;s day .
trust me , you can &apos;t . i &apos;ve tried .
no , no , no , i &apos;m going to have a &quot; me &quot; day .
first i &apos;m going to go to one of those spas in koreatown ,
take a steam and get a massage .
then i &apos;m going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies .
sheldon , i need to talk to you .
all right , my friend . would you like some cholermus ?
some what ?
cholermus . it &apos;s a traditional swiss breakfast dish .
i &apos;m preparing my gastrointestinal system
for the exotic cuisine of switzerland .
you &apos;re not going to switzerland !
oh , but i am .
didn &apos;t penny tell you the good news ?
she told me that you went behind my back
to guilt her into letting you go instead of her .
yes , that good news .
well , forget it . i was the one who was invited .
i get to decide who goes with me ,
and it &apos;s penny , not you !
howard , could you lower the lights ?
i have a short powerpoint presentation .
i don &apos;t need to see your presentation .
this discussion is over !
that &apos;s a somewhat ambiguous response .
am i going or not ?
sheldon , at this point ,
i would go by myself before i would take you .
really ?
yeah , really .
well , then , you leave me no alternative .
from this moment forward ,
we can be roommates , but we will no longer be friends .
i &apos;m sorry you feel that way .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re fully aware
of the ramifications here , leonard .
why don &apos;t you enlighten me ?
with the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified
you are no longer entitled to accompany me
to go swimming at bill gates &apos; house should i be invited .
ooh , that &apos;s gotta sting .
just think , this time tomorrow
we &apos;ll be in geneva , switzerland for our first valentine &apos;s day .
i know !
i went shopping today
and bought special undies for the occasion .
thermal ? &apos; cause it &apos;s gonna be cold .
think it through , leonard .
gesundheit .
or as they say in switzerland ,
gesundheit .
you getting a cold ?
no , no , it &apos;s probably just allergies .
do you want an allergy pill ?
&apos;cause i have &apos; em all .
prescription , nonprescription ,
foreign , domestic , experimental .
do any of them work ?
not really , i &apos;m just an enthusiast .
penny ?
you okay ?
did that sound okay to you ?
do not come in here !
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m having a tea party .
what do you think &apos;s going on ?
i think i might have the flu .
or the plague .
well , our plane leaves at 9 : 00 a.m.
do you think you &apos;ll feel better by then ?
yep .
&apos;cause i &apos;m gonna be dead .
hey , sheldon ?
listen , penny is pretty sick
and she &apos;s not going to be able to go to switzerland .
so if you &apos;re still interested , you &apos;re welcome to come .
great .
i &apos;ll start packing .
in a minute .
oh , look , it &apos;s the cholermus .
here &apos;s your soup .
chicken ?
yes .
with the little stars ?
yes .
heated to 180 degrees ?
why don &apos;t i pour it in your lap and you can tell me ?
you don &apos;t have to be mean .
i &apos;m sick .
yeah , well , i &apos;m sick , too .
not my problem .
i just don &apos;t understand how this happened to me .
i &apos;m scrupulous about my hygiene .
i regularly disinfect my hands ,
and i avoid contact with other people on general principle .
i don &apos;t know what to tell you , sheldon .
oh , penny , thank you !
you &apos;re welcome .
it &apos;s you !
i touched you !
happy valentine &apos;s day .
oh , my goodness , look at this room !
champagne !
roses !
and little chocolates !
this is going to be the best valentine &apos;s day ever .
yeah , i forgot about all this .
