What are those?
Ali was talking to somebody through the personal ads.
People turn on the microphone and anonymously record
any secret they want to with the understanding
that a stranger is gonna sit at this table
and listen to a random whisper.
Tanner saw both of us there.
After she takes me down, she can go after you, too,
and it will be all my fault.
Ashley, will you marry me?
Andrew?
Is there something going on between you two?
He's helping me study.
Alison was offered a plea bargain.
Part of the deal was to name her accomplice.
We were afraid she might name you.
Hanna's been arrested.
Tanner found the clothes mona was wearing the day she died
and Hanna's blood was on them.
I'm not taking the plea.
You will be here, prosecution there.
Don't be afraid to look at the jury.
We don't want them to think you have anything to hide.
I don't like the idea of 12 strangers off the street
deciding what happens to my daughter.
It's the American way.
They know nothing about me.
If I could just tell them the whole story...
Alison, we've discussed this before.
The key to winning this case isn't telling the jury
desperate stories about being plotted against.
Our job is to prevent the prosecutor from proving his case.
Right now, he has the tougher job.
Why?
He has to convince 12 jurors
beyond a reasonable doubt that Alison killed Mona.
All we have to do is make one of them unsure.
One of them?
That's all it takes.
Opening statements in Alison's trial begin at 9 A.M.
I'm gonna be there.
I'm not sure that's a good idea.
I'm going.
If something happens that effects you,
I don't want to hear about it second hand.
Someone is doing this to me.
You understand that, right?
And I think we know who that somebody is.
I told you it's not Ali.
Alison DiLaurentis is capable of anything.
I've experienced that firsthand.
But you can't be certain.
Certain enough.
Hanna, if you know anything about her,
now is the time to speak up while it can still help you.
Do anything to save myself?
What part of scripture is that from?
This is about telling the truth, Hanna.
I am telling the truth.
I didn't do anything and Ali didn't do anything either.
I don't care about the truth!
I care about getting my daughter out of this place.
That is all I care about.
You see, if my head hadn't have been so jet-laggy,
I would have remembered it sooner.
The number off of the Varjack receipt
is the same number as the personal ads in Ali's house.
How does this help Hanna?
Well, if Ali's not guilty,
then they can't charge Hanna as an accessory.
You can't help someone commit a crime
that they didn't commit.
But Ali already told us that the letter
and the passport are fake.
Why do we think the number and the ads are real?
I don't know.
But we didn't find the number with the other things.
So what if the numbers are the same,
what does that mean?
You know, we call it and it just rings,
no pick up, no voice mail, nothing.
Yeah, and meanwhile Neilan's law office is closed and locked.
But the number appearing twice...
It's got to mean something, we just have to figure it out.
What if we don't figure it out in time?
The three of you are gonna be late for school.
Uh, no, mom, teacher's conference.
They dropped the first two periods.
I told you.
Oh, then, uh, this is my chance to talk to all of you.
I want to strongly suggest that you girls stay away
from Alison's trial.
This is a suggestion?
For Emily and Aria, yes,
For you it's more than a suggestion.
What is Ali gonna think if we're not there?
I'm more concerned about what other people will think.
Juries have eyes.
The whole town knows that we're friends with her.
Yeah, if we don't go, it'll be like saying
we think she's guilty.
I can't tell you and Emily what to do,
but consider your actions.
Okay, so what are we gonna do when Hanna goes to trial?
Are we just supposed to turn our backs on her too?
We're not talking about ethics.
That's for sure.
Maybe we should go.
Yeah.
Spencer,
I want you to promise me
you won't go near that courtroom.
Everything I've tried to trace this number back to a source
just disappears into a black hole of nothingness.
No tagged ID, no localizing signature,
the phone on the other end could be on Mars
or on the other side of this room.
An insanely secure phone and somebody uses it to order pizza?
Maybe they don't know what they have.
Then why don't they pick up when we call?
Do you have a burner phone?
What color?
It's just gonna keep ringing.
Well, let's see what happens when I put it in writing.
Holly Golightly or Holly Varjack?
Send it.
What if we're not on the same book club?
Then we'll figure out something else?
Ali's running out of time.
And so is Hanna.
I know.
Spence, are you gonna be there tomorrow at the trial?
I don't know.
Listen, you guys, I have to go do something.
So I'll talk to you all later.
Sure.
Are you gonna be visiting Hanna today?
Tomorrow, but she said she'll try to call me today.
She has to get to Ali and ask about the phone number.
Jason.
Hello, Spencer.
I left you messages.
I know.
We need to talk.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Jason...
We've pretty much exhausted anything
that we have to say to each other.
You need to listen to me, okay?
No, I don't.
I did listen to you and now they have me down
as a prosecution witness.
I'm sorry.
Oh, you're sorry?
Good.
Please, we need to talk about how Ali isn't guilty.
Get in the car, Jason.
Please!
Get in the car now!
Mr. Dilaurentis, I just want to talk to Jason.
I'm not interested in what you want.
What you want doesn't help Alison.
We're neighbors at least for the moment.
In case you forgot, your house is the one
with the big gate and the wall.
Stay on the other side of it.
You've been hard to find.
I know. I'm sorry, I meant to text you back
but there's this...
you know, there's-- there's a lot going on right now.
I know.
How'd it go?
The test.
Am I a successful tutor?
Very successful.
Good.
How's Mike?
He's okay, I guess.
He's up in Harrisburg with his lacrosse team.
They're turning it into a field trip.
But I'm just kind of glad he's out of town
to keep his mind off, you know...
The trial?
Yeah, the trial.
It's happening fast, isn't it?
That's how Mr. Dilaurentis wanted it.
No motions, no delays.
I guess he thinks that's best for Alison.
I guess so.
Anyway, how are you?
Me? Fine.
I'm getting a little tired of memorializing Mona.
Mrs. Horowitz keeps talking about her.
She's just trying to understand what happened
like the rest of us.
I suppose.
Looks like she's ready to nominate Mona for sainthood.
Our best scholar,
our martyred hero,
like she won every championship on her own.
I guess she was a pretty aggressive competitor.
Not aggressive, vicious.
I've seen her intellectually kneecap dozens of kids,
and the only thing Mona likes better than winning
is taking the credit.
We're lucky she didn't get to college
and start thinking about running for president.
Are you saying that the world's better off without her?
I'm just saying there are other people on this team.
Hello?
This call is from the Chester Women's Correctional Facility.
You have a call
from inmate Alison Dilaurentis.
To accept this call, press 1.
Hello, Ali.
Hello, Emily.
You okay?
Never better.
You'll be fine.
Really?
What makes you say that?
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
I didn't call to say that.
I just...
Listen, tomorrow, will you be there?
I'll try.
You'll try?
I'll be there.
Thank you.
Somebody said it was raining.
Is it raining back home?
Yes, it's-- it's raining.
Good night, Em.
Good night, Ali.
Remember high school?
Remember when every hallway slight was like an assault?
When allegiances and enemies
were magnified out of all proportion?
It is a world where a perceived opponent
must be dealt with quickly,
without remorse.
And that is what Alison Dilaurentis did
to Mona Vanderwaal.
Miss Marcus will be up here shortly
and she is going to tell you an amazing story
about Alison Dilaurentis.
How she was kidnapped and traumatized
by two years of captivity.
How she escaped her captors and returned home,
helped by her closest friends.
It is a remarkable story.
It's breathtaking.
None of it happened.
It's a fairy tale.
The commonwealth will prove,
with direct testimony of witnesses,
that Alison Dilaurentis' epic tale
of abduction and escape is a lie.
It is a lie created by her
and perpetuated by the friends that helped to "save" her.
Mona Vanderwaal knew the truth.
She had the power to destroy the fantasy created by Alison
and maintained with her little group of followers.
And that is why Alison Dilaurentis
planned and carried out the murder of Mona Vanderwaal,
consigning her to a cruel, anonymous end.
They know about Ali not being kidnapped.
They probably know about New York too.
How could they know?
Witnesses.
Spencer, he said they've got witnesses.
Cyrus.
Cyrus?
What about Cyrus?
The cops must have found Cyrus.
He knows the whole kidnapping story
and he'd do anything to save himself.
Aria, where's Mike?
He's in Harrisburg.
Good.
Good?
What do you mean good? Why is that good?
You knew about this.
You all knew and you told the police.
This isn't going to solve the problem, Mr. Dilaurentis.
You talked her into it, that's what happened.
The four of you talked her into this.
It was your idea.
Dad, Ali lied to them the same as she lied to us.
Jason, you don't know--
Not here, gentlemen.
You heard all that?
Yeah, I heard.
They adjourned for the day
but we'll call if anything else happens.
Okay.
The personal ads are real.
The ads are real but the passport is fake.
How does that work?
Somebody planted them,
but I hid things in the house too.
Everybody hides things, Hanna.
And the phone number Spencer found?
That's real.
Who were you talking to?
Not talking, texting.
When my mother was killed,
somebody bought a tribute out in the paper.
All it said was "Goodnight, light" and the red balloon
and a response number, a code the papers use.
"Goodnight light."
I know that's from a book.
My mother used to read that to me when I was a baby.
Well, who would know that?
That's what I was trying to find out.
So I answered and 2 days later
another AD, "Goodnight nobody, goodnight brush."
"Goodnight to the old lady whispering hush."
And then a phone number, I sent a text.
Why didn't you tell us you were doing this?
You've been talking to "A" and you never said a word.
Aria killed Shana in New York.
Okay, my mother was buried in Spencer's backyard.
I was afraid that you were gonna get hurt.
Whoever it was,
said they knew who killed my mother.
They were just torturing me.
It wasn't "A," it was Mona.
How are you so sure it was Mona?
The only thing I know for sure is
that the texts stopped when Mona was killed.
Emily and Aria were at the courthouse today.
Well, whoever told you that must have told you
that I wasn't there with them.
Did you know what was gonna happen?
I heard.
Too late to do anything about it.
Too late to do anything except to warn me not to be there?
Maybe now you understand why I did that.
I'm still trying to understand why you and Melissa lied to me
and tried to keep me from coming back
when my friends needed me?
Someone will be going to prison for a very long time.
My only concern is that it's not going to be you.
Don't you want to ask me
if I knew about Ali's fake kidnapping?
No.
Because I'm telling you, you didn't.
All that time she was talking to somebody about her mother,
she never told you?
She thinks it was Mona.
Ali is scared.
She's trying to be brave
but I can see something running around inside her,
behind her eyes.
Is there anything running around behind your eyes?
Oh, yeah, snakes, spiders, flying monkeys...
nothing I can't handle.
We're gonna get you out of here...
I promise.
Be careful what you promise.
Hanna.
I'm starting to think that this isn't gonna work out
the way we want it to.
You can't think like that.
We will figure this out.
Even if we figure this out, no one is gonna believe us.
I wouldn't believe the story that's happening to me.
You can't lose hope.
The thing I hope for is for you to stay safe.
That's the only promise I want you to make.
If things get worse, I want you to find a way out.
What do you mean out?
Out, away, gone.
I want you to get on a plane or a boat
and go somewhere where they can't find you.
Caleb, I can manage as long as you're safe.
Well, I'm not gonna do that.
Well, that's what I want you to do.
Promise me.
Well, is the phone number a dead end or not?
What if it's Mona's and it's a dead end?
Mona is dead, so who is the lawyer talking to?
I mean, he had to be getting his instructions from someone.
You okay?
Yeah.
Aria.
It's the number.
Look, it's the Varjack number.
Answer it.
Why does it have my number?
I never called from my phone.
Answer it quick.
They don't know we're here.
We don't have time for this.
Hello?
Who is it?
Are you getting this?
I'm getting it.
We don't know what it means.
I know what it means.
I mean, I don't know but I've heard it before.
Where?
In Mona's room.
She used to play this song,
French music from people like Edith Pilaf.
Like the rice dish?
Piaf, Edith Piaf.
Ali was wrong.
It was never Mona taunting her, it was "A."
Then why call back and play that song?
Why not let us keep thinking it was Mona?
To rub it in our faces.
Well, Mona never sent that lawyer,
but that doesn't mean she left us in the dark.
She hid the tape Hanna found in that book.
The police went all over that room
and they never found it.
So?
So maybe there's more.
Maybe the answer is just still in that room.
We have to get back to Mona's room.
Hanna, you spent more time in that room than any of us,
so try to think about places
that Mona would have hid stuff.
Okay.
We need to talk to Mona's mom.
But she wasn't at the trial.
It's got to be hard to hear
people talk about your dead daughter.
Guys, if there's something in that room
that can get me out of here,
I don't care how upset she is, just find it.
We'll do it.
That's me. They're gonna cut me off.
Hang on.
Hanna, stay strong. We love you.
Here.
Sorry for grabbing it from you.
It's okay.
No, it's not.
If we start stepping on each other,
none of us are gonna make it out alive.
Should we go see Mona's mom?
Not all at once.
That's just gonna scare her.
I'll go do it.
Well, I'm the least intimidating.
I'll drive you.
Spence.
I'll call you guys later.
Okay.
I should have put Hanna in a car
and taken off when I had the chance.
Why didn't you?
She would never leave you and Aria and Em.
You guys are like a band of vikings.
Well, less pillaging, better hygiene.
She told me to get out before it got too late.
She said it to me but I think that she meant it
for all of us.
Do you have any idea how hard that must have been for her
to say that to you?
The point is she said it.
Are you thinking about it?
No.
You know, when all of this is over
and we are safe and sound,
I need to talk about bottling you.
"Essence of best boyfriend," we're gonna make a fortune.
Have you talked to Toby since you got back?
It's not really a good idea under the circumstances.
Finish your cookie.
No answer.
Do you really think there's something up there,
or are we just chasing smoke?
I don't know.
But whatever Mona was, she wasn't stupid.
So if she knew what might happen,
she could have left us a clue.
If, might, could.
That's all we've got.
Well, what if it's not enough?
We're running out of time, we're all gonna get
dragged down the rabbit hole with Ali.
Do you want to just give up and go shopping?
Not just yet.
Hi.
Hi.
Just wanted to apologize for earlier,
about my dad outside the office.
That's okay.
Still a pretty clear path through there
between our houses.
Yeah, well there's been a lot of traffic over the years.
Guess that's how you knew she'd come this way when she ran.
Is that how you trapped her for the police?
I really wish that we hadn't.
I let her go.
I let her run away.
Why do you think I did that?
Maybe you thought there was a chance
she was telling the truth.
That's a funny thing for you to say.
Jason, I made a terrible mistake.
No, I made the mistake, Spencer.
I listened to you.
I don't think this is gonna come as any surprise to you,,
but I can be really certain about things.
Not a surprise.
I like being certain.
Okay, it's where I'm comfortable.
I-I'm-I'm not happy in the grey places,
so sometimesre I go to the shore
when I know that I shouldn't.
And there's somebody out there
who knows that about me, and they're doing a very good job
of using it against me.
Nobody likes the grey places.
I don't think Alison killed anybody.
Jason?
I got a call from the prosecutor's office.
They're shuffling the witness list.
I'm testifying tomorrow.
If I hadn't stopped to write this,
I would have been able to make a clean getaway.
Where do you think you're going?
Mom, I'm going to Alison's trial.
I forbid it.
Forbid?
That's a big hefty 19th century word.
Spencer, please, don't go.
I'm sorry.
I can't do what you're asking me to do, I have to go.
If they see you there...
If people are gonna talk about me,
I'm not gonna let them do it behind my back.
And being afraid isn't going to make things better.
Is this the video the police showed you?
Yes.
After you saw it, did you tell the police
of your sister Alison's whereabouts
on the day that Mona Vanderwaal was attacked?
I said that she wasn't with us.
Why have you decided to tell the truth about Alison's alibi?
I don't know.
Was it because of something you saw on the video?
I don't think so.
Something's wrong.
He's changing his story.
Didn't you tell Detective Tanner
that you thought the attacker in the video was Alison?
I might have said that, yes,
but I don't believe that now.
You told police...
I've been thinking and I'm sure
that couldn't have been Alison.
Mr. Dilaurentis...
do you know a girl named Hanna Marin?
Objection.
Irrelevant.
Where are we going, Mr. Sirk?
Your Honor, the witness has confirmed
that the defendant doesn't have an alibi.
That's fact.
I would like the jury to understand
what may have influenced his identification of the attacker.
Counselor?
Your Honor, if Mr. Sirk wants to cross-examine
his own witness, I have no objection.
Proceed.
Do you know Hanna Marin?
Yes.
Is she a friend of your sister Alison?
Yes.
Who is Ashley Marin?
Hanna's mother.
Objection. Irrelevant.
Goes to foundation.
Overruled.
But don't take the scenic route, Mr. Sirk.
Is Mrs. Marin in the courtroom today?
Yes.
Point her out to the jury, please.
She's in the third row.
She's wearing a blue dress.
Does Mrs. Marin work for you?
She did, she doesn't anymore.
Did you have occasion to meet with her outside of the office?
Yes.
Socially?
Yes.
How many times have you been with her socially?
That's...
I didn't count.
These social meetings,
were they always in public places?
Most of them.
But not all of them.
Some were in private.
Yes.
Is he saying what I think he's saying?
How would you characterize these private meetings?
Seriously?
Sorry, I don't think I understand the question.
Well, would you describe them as intimate?
They were private.
Did anything happen during these private meetings
with the attractive woman seated in the gallery
that led you to alter your testimony?
No.
Did Ashley Marin, the mother of someone accused
as an accomplice to this crime,
offer any personal inducement to you
to change your testimony to favor the defense?
Objection. Asked and answered.
Sustained. Move on, Mr. Sirk.
Last chance, Mr. Dilaurentis.
Do you want to clear this up,
or leave it to the jury's imagination?
Objection.
Improper, inflammatory, irrelevant.
Sustained.
Do you have any other questions for this witness?
Nothing further.
Do you think Hanna knew about this?
She did.
And it looks like "A" knew about it, too.
Well, what happened in there hurt Ali, didn't it?
Yeah. It made it sound like her own brother thinks she did it.
Until Hanna's mom convinced him to change his story.
Do you think that's what she did?
Hanna's mom?
Hold on.
Jason?
Are you all right?
Ask me after I find a place to sleep tonight.
You and Hanna's mom...
It's none of your business, Spencer.
It's nobody's business.
No, you're right.
It's not.
If you really need a place to stay...
It's okay.
I'll figure something out.
Cross your fingers and wish hard
that you never have to sit in that chair.
You won't like it.
What did he say?
The truth will set you free
but first it turns you inside out.
Come on.
Where?
Mona's house.
Well, you were right.
I shouldn't have gone to the trial.
I don't think it would have made much of a difference
if you'd stayed away.
You might as well start answering that.
It can keep.
You're gonna have to talk to someone sooner or later.
If they haven't heard already,
they're going to hear it on the news.
Most of the ladies in the congregation
manage to pull the news straight out of the atmosphere.
It's really amazing.
You can go, Ted.
I just want to finish my coffee first.
No, I mean...
you can go.
It's all right.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not being noble, I'm being practical.
I made a promise to you.
And believe me, there is a time
when I would have held you to that but...
not now.
It's not a way to start a life together.
We can get through this.
Yes, we can.
And then what?
We are who we are, Ted.
I never asked you to explain.
You should have.
What's the point of forgiveness if you don't know
what really happened?
It's about a clean slate.
There is no such thing.
I'm beginning to think that's the way
it was supposed to be.
Thank you.
But you should go.
I'll just finish my coffee.
Okay?
Do you think she's in there?
Mrs. Vanderwaal!
Okay, she's not here, she wasn't at the trial, where is she?
She's hiding.
I don't blame her.
Okay, it was a long shot.
Long shots are all we have.
We should try and get to Hanna.
Well, it was a good idea.
"Finders keepers, losers weepers."
Quelle tristesse.
"A."
Your accent's getting better.
Wait.
What?
How would you stop someone from searching your room?
What do you mean?
Why do we think that "A" found something
just because "A" said so?
The note was written to taunt us.
Or trick us.
Think like Mona.
Just for a minute.
If I were Mona...
What the hell is a chandelier ritual?
I have no idea.
Let me change, I think better in lower heels.
Okay.
Aria?
I didn't want you getting the wrong idea.
About what?
I've been thinking, and I realize
I made a really bad impression what I said about Mona.
Look.
Everything about Mona was complicated.
Yeah. But when I said that about her,
I saw the look on your face.
And it wasn't the way I want to see you look at me...
ever.
It's just my face.
Sometimes it does things without checking with me first.
Well, it sounded like
she deserved what happened to her,
and I don't believe that.
Yeah. Nobody does.
It was bothering me.
Just wanted to make sure we're clear on this.
Yeah, we're clear.
And if you need me for anything,
cramming for an exam
or driving out to some road house,
you've got me on speed dial, right?
Yeah. Right.
Okay. I feel better.
I guess I surprised your face again, huh?
It's okay. I'll call you.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.
I'm the one who should be saying sorry.
For what?
For being human?
I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time.
Awful lot of mistakes, Hanna.
I have made so many mistakes.
It'll be okay.
Whatever happens, we'll be okay.
I'm supposed to be saying that to you.
It's not gonna be that bad.
I mean, maybe I'll write a book or something.
Lots of people write books in prison.
Martha Stewart wrote one.
I just hope you didn't get the bad decision gene from me.
Well, I hope I did.
I hope I got all of your DNA in me.
That means I'll be smart and I'll be brave
and I'll sing my daughter
the best lullabies when she's scared.
Do you know how much I love you?
Yeah, I think I do.
We're quite the pair.
All lying is a one way street.
It's kind of like those signs in parking lots.
"Backing up causes severe tire damage."
What does your lawyer think?
She remains confident,
except when she doesn't know that I'm looking at her.
Is there anything I can do?
You had the right idea a long time ago.
Get out.
Just leave, Jason.
Do it now.
I believe you, Ali.
I believed you since that night at the house
when you tried to get away.
I saw it in your face, you didn't kill anyone.
No.
But I let a lot of things happen that I shouldn't have.
I took money from my mom's purse
and she thought it was my brother
and that's who got punished.
This was 20, 25 years ago.
The broken headlight,
I did that, I think.
I don't remember much of that night.
Oh, I hate my boobs,
they're like a complete joke.
The dog didn't run away,
I left the gate open on purpose.
