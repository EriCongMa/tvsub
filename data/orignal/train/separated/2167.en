I know you're scared.
But... it's gonna be okay.
I want my mommy.
I know exactly how you feel.
Gotta hand it to you, buddy.
You got a lot of heart, showing up with that haircut.
You know, I find it difficult to be insulted by a man
who uses more product in his hair than most women do.
Sinead O'connor called, she wants her hairstyle back.
Very good.
Well, hairstyle would imply that this was intentional,
and I think Steve just got a little carried away trimming his sideburns.
You, too, huh?
What? It's what happened.
It's okay.
Hakkeyoi nokotta, nokotta, nokotta!
There you go, people.
The winner once again,
my little cousin,
the Samoan Scrapper, Flippa!
Winner!
Now who wants to take on the champ
for a chance at free grindz?
Dude, pick me, pick me!
Over here, man.
Me! Come on, man!
Get in the ring, little sistah.
You've got to be kidding.
He's not even trying to make it look like a fair fight anymore.
Come on.
No, no, no. I like her.
I like homegirl's chances. She's, uh...
she's very scrappy-looking.
All right, I like her a lot.
Thanks, Zac.
Sorry I'm late.
No worries. I just ordered.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
You sure?
It's Adam.
I just haven't heard from him in days.
Left him messages, sent him texts.
Well, maybe he's tied up at work.
Maybe.
Maybe he's just avoiding me.
Kono, what's going on?
I can't really put my finger on it. It's just...
Adam's definitely different.
It's like he's more secretive, you know?
It's like he's hiding something.
Hiding what?
I'm not sure.
It seemed to start when his...
when his brother Michael came out of prison.
Kono, that was months ago.
Why didn't you say something sooner?
If you can't trust Adam, then you can't be with him.
Do you trust him?
I don't know.
Look, you know that I had my doubts about him, right?
Yeah.
But he was there for you when you needed him most.
So, before you assume the worst,
why don't you at least give him a chance to explain?
Hakkeyoi nokotta, nokotta, nokotta!
Ooh, bold new look there, boss.
Everybody? Really? Okay, it's hair.
You know the good thing about hair? It grows back.
If you're lucky.
Hakkeyoi nokotta, nokotta, nokotta!
Winner!
Winner!
Shrimp dinner!
Sorry, cuz.
Don't sweat it. That shrimp plate?
It's coming out of your paycheck.
McGarrett.
Yeah, we're on the way.
We got to go.
A couple hikers discovered her this morning.
Jane Doe, no I.D.
She can't be older than 17.
Shot in the back
and dumped in a shallow grave.
My guys found some fresh tire tracks nearby.
CSU's making casts.
No shoes,
feet are torn up pretty good.
Scratches and splinters on her arms.
Probably from the branches.
I'm thinking the shooter drove out here to execute her,
she made a run for it,
he shot her in the back.
You all right?
We got to go find her parents.
Okay, thank you.
Lab just confirmed that the tire tracks found at the scene
are consistent with late-model Ford vans and trucks--
that's anything manufactured after 2008.
Plus, the tires were sold commercially.
That's fantastic.
So that narrows it down to about 2,000 vehicles on this island.
Hey, so the autopsy report came back.
Max put T.O.D. around 1:00 a.m. this morning.
But this is what you really need to see.
What is that, ankle bruising?
It's not just bruising.
It's scar tissue.
Max also found calcification around the ankle bone.
For that to develop, the victim
would have had to have been restrained a long time.
How long?
Years.
They were keeping this girl prisoner.
All right, Max say there were any signs of sexual abuse?
No.
But he did find a foreign hair on the body.
Okay.
If the hair doesn't belong to the victim,
maybe her killer left it behind.
Yeah, Fong's running it for DNA.
Got an I.D. on our Jane Doe.
Prints turned up in the missing persons database.
Her name's Amanda Morris.
My God. When did she go missing?
2003.
She was seven years old when she was kidnapped,
which would make her 17 today.
Chin, run age progression software on that photograph, please.
It's obviously her.
Amanda Morris was kidnapped ten years ago.
Where's she been this whole time?
The only thing worse than losing your daughter...
is losing her twice.
All those years spent waiting,
holding out hope that the police would find Amanda.
And that whole time, she was right here on the Island?
I don't understand.
How could this happen?
Well,
there's still a lot that we don't know about this case.
But, uh, please believe me when I say
we are doing everything we can to find the person who did this.
We know it was a long time ago, but anything you can tell us
about Amanda's abduction could maybe help with our case.
It was her summer break,
and we were at the water park.
Amanda had worked up enough courage to
go down the high slide,
so I-I walked her over to the line and...
and I waited at the bottom.
I had my camera out to take that picture of her coming down.
She never did.
It's likely
whoever took your daughter was using the water park
as his hunting ground.
This could have happened to anybody.
Yeah.
But it happened to us.
Chin, I stopped by HPD,
and I picked up the case file on Amanda's abduction.
It's pretty thin.
Did their investigation turn up any leads or suspects?
No. At the time, HPD followed protocol and they ran background
on Amanda's family and neighbors,
all of them who checked out.
Investigators always suspected it was a professional job.
Possibly part of a child trafficking ring.
Well, except by all appearances,
Amanda was never taken off the Island.
So why was she abducted?
I'm heading back now.
I just need to make a quick stop first.
All right.
Okay.
Adam?
Drop your weapons!
Drop them, both of you!
Do the math.
You don't have enough time to get off two shots.
I wouldn't be so sure.
Admire the confidence.
Comes with the badge.
Is that right?
Five-O.
You must be Adam's cop girlfriend.
We got concealed carry permits if you care to see 'em.
Those things permit you to break into people's homes, too?
Door was open.
We just came to see if Adam was around.
You know where we might find him?
He went to see Sato, didn't he?
Who the hell is Sato?
Never mind, then.
If you see your boyfriend,
tell him his brother Michael's looking for him.
So, Amanda Morris is kidnapped ten years ago.
There's no ransom demands,
there's no signs of abuse,
and we know she wasn't trafficked
because she never left the Island.
Okay, so what was the kidnapper doing with her all these years?
I don't know, but there's another question that we're not asking,
and that is, why kill her now?
All right, what changed that led Amanda's abductor
to suddenly want to get rid of her
after ten years?
Hey.
Just heard from Fong.
Lab got a hit on that foreign hair
found on Amanda's body.
Only it didn't come from our killer.
How do we know that?
Because it came back
to a six-year-old girl named Ella Bishop...
who was kidnapped from her home in Waipio yesterday afternoon.
There's only one way
that her hair ended up on Amanda's body.
Both girls were kidnapped by the same person.
Ella was wearing a blue jumper with a whiteT-shirt.
She also had a heart bracelet with her name on it.
If anyone has seen her, please call the police right away.
We just want our daughter back.
Thank you. We'll get this out right away.
Let's go.
Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm Tip Gilbert.
And my crew and I are here to see if
the family needs any help.
Your daughter was MAILE?
Yes, she was.
Hey, uh, I heard about you guys.
Uh, like what you do, you help HPD.
Missing persons cases,
you set up search parties-- it's good.
Never hurts to have too many eyes and ears out there.
Right.
Look, I know you guys
are doing everything you can to find Ella,
but if you get a lead and need us to hit the streets,
give me a call.
All right. Great.
Thank you very much.
My pleasure.
Nice work. Thanks, guys.
No.
I mean, ten years is a long time,
but I don't think I've ever seen her.
Sorry.
No.
I got to ask you, though,
if it's been so long,
why do you think these two cases are related?
Mr. Bishop, Amanda Morris' body
was discovered this morning,
and evidence on it indicates
that she was in contact with your daughter.
Oh, no...
Listen,
we have every reason to believe right now
that your daughter is okay.
Hear me? We think that she's okay.
So, I need you both to stay optimistic,
'cause we are gonna find her
and we're gonna bring her back to you.
Okay?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
I know what you're gonna say, okay?
Cop warnning one:
do not make promises that you cannot keep.
Okay, I get it.
You all but guaranteed
those people we'd find their daughter.
What... what happens when we can't
deliver on that promise, Danny?
What do we do then?
Listen to me.
When Grace was taken by Rick Peterson last year,
I know it was only for a couple of hours,
but it felt like a month.
It was the worst day of my life,
and every second, you cannot stop
thinking about worst-case scenario.
So I-I know what Ella's parents
are going through right now,
and hope, even if it is false hope,
is the only thing that's keeping them going.
Yeah, Chin?
HPD canvass got a lead.
One of Ella's neighbors noticed a suspicious vehicle
parked on her street roughly an hour before the kidnapping.
I ran the plate,
and it came back to a 2009 Ford Econoline van.
Oh, that's consistent with the tire tracks
that were found at the scene
where Amanda Morris' body was dumped.
All right, so our killer uses the same van to abduct Ella.
Uh, who's it registered to?
Well, that's the thing.
The van was reported stolen 48 hours ago.
I've already put out an APB and a MAILE AMBER Alert.
HPD has got all available units
searching the Island for it.
I'll update you as soon as we have some more information.
All right, copy that. Thank you, Chin.
What are you doing?
Getting some extra eyes out there.
Detective Williams.
Danny,
it's Tip.
We got a lock on the van.
He's northbound on Kalanianaole Highway.
Coming out of Waimanalo.
Okay, please stay right on him. We're on our way.
All right?
Roger that.
Show me your hands right now!
On the ground.
Face down. Face down!
Face down... now lock your fingers behind your head.
Danny?
She in there?
No.
Lloyd Grimes.
You got an impressive body of work here.
Corruption of a minor, aggravated assault,
assault with a deadly weapon.
Now you can add kidnapping and murder to that resume?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Ella Bishop. Where is she?
What, you mean that girl who went missing?
Who's all in the news?
Why would you think I had something to do with that?
Because the day she went missing, you were spotted
in a stolen van parked two blocks from her house.
I have nothing more to say to you guys.
Listen to me, okay?
The only reason I don't choke the life out of you
right now is because I think you know where that little girl is.
So do yourself a favor
and speak up.
Danny.
Tell me where she is right now.
Danny!
Step away.
I didn't kidnap any girl, I swear.
Oh, you guys are insane!
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
Defense becomes the offense.
What? Get that Ball.
Good!
Danno, what are you doing here?
Come here, babe.
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
Everything's good, monkey, I just wanted a hug.
All right?
All right, go ahead.
Ready!
Defense becomes the offense.
What? Get that ball.
So, HPD searched our suspect's house.
No sign of Ella, but they did find
upwards of 30 grand worth of stolen property
stashed in the guy's garage.
Okay, so he's a kidnapper and a thief.
Actually, here's the thing.
A bunch of the items traced back
to recent burglaries in Ella's neighborhood.
This guy hit over a dozen houses over the past month.
That's why his van was spotted there yesterday.
He wasn't there to grab Ella. He was casing the neighborhood.
Makes sense, given there was
another house robbed there last night.
Either this guy's quite the multitasker,
or he's not our kidnapper.
Saw you on that left. Late drop.
I thought you weren't gonna make it.
Yeah, you and me both.
So, what'd you want to talk to me about?
I need a favor.
All right, Steve's usually the one asking for those.
He sending you to do his dirty work?
No.
This one's for me.
I need to run intel on someone,
but I need it done off the books.
This isn't about a case, is it?
What's the name?
Sato. It's a common Japanese surname.
But the guy I'm looking for is connected
to the Yakuza in some way.
Is Adam in some kind of trouble?
That's what I need to find out.
But, Catherine,
I'd really appreciate it if you just kept this between us.
Kono, if Steve asks me about, I'm not going to lie to him.
He's not going to ask 'cause he doesn't know anything.
Security cam footage from the Bank of O'Ahu on Waipio.
That's just a few blocks from Ella Bishop's house.
One of their ATMs faces right out onto the street.
I was hoping it may have caught our kidnapper on video.
Any luck?
No.
So far, none of the vehicles matches the tire tracks
found at the murder scene.
You ever hear from Adam?
Uh, yeah... actually.
He finally called back, and you were right.
He was just wrapped up with work.
Glad to hear it.
Thanks.
That's odd.
What is?
That blue sedan
it passes through the intersection
six times in the 20 minutes before Ella was abducted.
Okay, but the tire tracks at the murder scene
were left by a van or a truck.
Oh, our guy could have used
a different vehicle for the kidnapping.
Six times in 20 minutes. Either he's lost
or he's waiting for an opportunity.
I'll run the plate.
Vehicle's registered to a Helen Cantera.
That's Cantera.
Check out what she's wearing.
An HPD uniform.
Chin, she's not a cop.
That's how she got Ella into the car with her.
No plates.
And the car in the video was blue.
Paint's fresh. Cantera's trying to cover her tracks.
Movement. Hey.
Steve!
Helen Cantera, Five-O!
If Ella's in there with you, you need to let her go right...
Gun!
Any sign of Ella?
She's not here.
She knew, Danny.
She knew, and she chose to take her own life
rather than tell us where Ella is.
Must have come off Ella's wrist
when she was in the trunk.
As far as the property is concerned,
HPD has searched this place top to bottom,
and so far there's no sign that Ella was ever here.
Maybe Cantera has her stashed someplace else
until the heat dies down.
It's possible, but Amanda Morris was held prisoner for ten years.
Assuming Cantera kept her here,
why is there no signs of that either?
Guys?
There's something inside you need to see.
All right, so "Cop" was definitely not
the only role in Cantera's repertoire.
Look at this-- nurse, paramedic, nun.
Those are all people a child would trust.
All right, if Cantera's got this many disguises,
that means she's done this more than twice.
Yeah. So, we're dealing with what,
a serial abductor?
A serial abductor who traffics children for profit.
There's 40 grand in there easy.
Well, that explains why, after ten years, there's no evidence
of Amanda ever having been here.
Cantera kidnapped her for somebody else.
And now that same person has Ella.
You must be hungry.
I made you a sandwich.
I'm not hungry. I want to go home.
You are home, sweetie.
May I join you?
I'm sorry he had to do that to you.
I'm sure you're scared,
and you probably miss your parents a lot.
But there's something I need you to know.
Your mommy and daddy were in a very bad accident.
I want to see them.
I'm sorry, honey.
You can't.
Ever again.
They're in Heaven.
And we're your family now.
This just in.
Big development in the Ella Bishop case.
Investigators have identified
a local woman who they believe
to be the suspected kidnapper.
We're being told her name is Helen Cantera,
and that HPD raided her residence just hours ago.
Authorities are still at the scene combing through evidence
in order to locate the missing girl.
In other news, the Transit Authority says
the H-1 will reopen tomorrow morning.
Proposed roadwork will proceed.
I ran background on Helen Cantera.
She's originally from Arizona.
She moved to the Island back in October of 2002.
Less than a year later, Amanda Morris goes missing.
So, more than likely, Cantera kidnapped both our victims.
Yeah, and who knows how many
other kids during that time.
All right, get HPD everything that you have on Cantera.
And see if they can link her to any
open kidnapping cases.
Okay. Sorry. I got to take this.
Yeah.
Hey. Are you alone?
Yeah.
Good.
Listen, I'm e-mailing you a full intel package
on Riku Sato.
You were right about him being connected to the Yakuza.
Guy's what they call an Oyabun.
That means he's a boss of one of the families.
Sato's been linked to over a dozen murders.
Politicians, heads of rival criminal syndicates.
He also used to be in business
with Adam's father, Hiro Noshimuri,
back when Hiro was a power player in the Yakuza.
And, Kono, there's more.
Japanese police have been monitoring Sato's compound
in Osaka for months.
Check the last entry in their surveillance logs.
Adam's there.
He arrived two days ago.
Kono,
this may be none of my business,
but if your boyfriend is getting into business
with the head of the Yakuza,
I really think you need to tell Steve.
Hey, Cath? Uh, sorry. I have to go.
I just dumped Cantera's cell phone.
Listen to the voice mail she received this morning.
It's done. Meet me at 9:00 tonight.
And bring the cash.
Cash? Cash for what?
Number traces back to a David Parsons.
He works in the Vital Records Division of the Hawaii Department of Health.
Over the years he created a total of 21
false identities for Cantera's victims.
I forwarded everything to the
FBI's Human Trafficking Division.
They're gonna start tracking those kids down now.
Check this out.
The last false identity he created was for Ella.
She was put into the system
under the name Lisa Beckett.
Here's the thing, though--
the parents listed on the birth certificate
are Ray and Terry Beckett.
And we verified they're an actual married couple
living in Makaha.
And that's not all.
Records show that they've also been collecting welfare benefits
on an older daughter named Jessica Beckett for the past ten years.
Amanda.
And the benefits run out in November when she turns 18.
That's why they got rid of Amanda
and brought in Ella.
They need a minor in there to keep the money flowing.
Five-O.
Where's the girl?
You're interrupting my lunch.
Hang on. I got this.
Ma'am, stay where you are. Put your hands up.
Ma'am, put your hands up and don't move.
Okay, you, get up.
Up. Up, up, up.
Hands behind your back.
Get up, stand up.
Hands behind your back, hands behind your back.
Nothing.
I guess whatever you're looking for's not here.
Shut up.
Danny.
I want to see a warrant.
Shut up.
Where is she?
Where is she?
Okay.
All right.
You don't want to talk about Ella.
Let's talk about Amanda, then, okay?
Who's Amanda?
Who's Amanda? Amanda...
is a little innocent girl that you kept prisoner here
in your house for ten years.
All so you could collect $500 in welfare benefits.
I mean, I don't understand. Doesn't make any sense to me.
Y-You could've... you could've made that same amount,
uh, recycling tin cans.
I can't work.
I'm on disability.
Oh, you're on disability.
That's good.
Explain to me 'cause I don't understand.
How would it... how would it go? Child Services,
they come by, uh, you let that little girl out of her cage,
put on a little act? A little show?
Huh? Is that how it went?
I mean, how much fear did you have to instill
in that little kid to keep her mouth shut, huh?
I don't think you're anything like your husband.
To him, these girls were just a payday, but...
...I think you cared about them.
The way this place is decorated,
all the gifts, the books.
He didn't do this.
You did all this, right?
But if you really care about Ella, you need to tell me
where she is right now
or she's gonna end up like Amanda.
You understand?
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait.
Ray didn't tell you what he did to Amanda, did he?
You're trying to trick me.
Oh, my God.
Look at the photograph.
Look at it.
She was about to turn 18.
He had no use for her anymore.
What'd you think he was gonna do, let her go?
If I'd have known...
If you'd have known what?
You wouldn't have done anything.
That's not true.
Prove it.
Where's Ella?
You took Ella away in your truck this afternoon.
You told your wife
that you needed to hide her
until things cooled down.
So why don't you just tell us right now where Ella is, all right?
Last chance. Where is she?
Why would I give up the only leverage I've got right now?
Leverage?
Danny!
You can't do that to me.
You're cops!
Give me your badge.
Give me the badge.
That's 400 yards out from the road.
This is where Ray said it would be.
Marker right here. Here's his marker.
Hey, everybody! Right over here!
Look around. Everybody, right around here.
Hey, guys, over here!
Ella!
Ella!
Hey, get a shovel here! Come on.
Bring some shovels.
Come on, come on come on come on.
Ella, can you hear us?
Ella?
Ella?
Ella?
Ella.
Come here, sweetie. Come here.
You're okay. I got you.
We got you. You okay?
You all right?
Anything hurt?
You okay, babe?
You all right?
Let's get you out of here. Come on.
Let's go home.
Ella!
Ella!
Ella.
Some things I can remember more than others.
Like my house on Kaaholo Street.
My bike in the driveway
with the pink tassels on the handlebars.
Mom's face I'll never forget.
It's there when I look in the mirror.
When I was little, people would say how much I looked like her.
Dad only comes in glimpses.
Sitting on his lap while he read books to me.
How big his hands were next to mine.
The way his cologne smelled.
Those memories are all I have left.
They tell me my parents are dead, but I don't believe it.
I know they're still alive
and they still love me.
