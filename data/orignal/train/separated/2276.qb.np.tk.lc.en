第四集
i dub thee sir david of the round table .
i &apos;m the voice in your head ,
the dark one &apos;s powers inside you .
she has to die .
she has to die .
don &apos;t .
we can find another way together .
it is said one of you is the savior .
i am the savior .
look around .
someday , this village
will be the great kingdom of camelot ,
and i will be king .
you have some very strange dreams .
but they &apos;re not just dreams .
come on !
can i trust you with a secret ?
this tree ... a man is trapped insidit ...
a great sorcerer known as merlin .
he spoke to me one night .
he gave me a prophecy .
told me i would pull a sword from a stone
and become king of camelot .
king ... arthur ?
yes .
and you will be queen guinevere .
and on all your birthdays ,
i &apos;ll fill the kingdom with flowers .
a middlemist ?
i love it .
there &apos;s more where that came from .
i &apos;ll show you .
arthur , is that the sword in the stone ?
it &apos;s not . we should leave .
go on , king arthur . pull the sword .
leave him alone , kay !
his mother must have dropped him on his head
before she took off ,
and now he thinks he &apos;s the orphan king .
they call camelot the broken kingdom
because we have no king and we never will .
and nobody in camelot is ever gonna kneel to the boy
who cleans the stables .
maybe he &apos;s right .
no , he &apos;s not ,
and you will find that sword .
all you have to do now
is follow your heart .
where &apos;s the rest of it ?
how will you take the throne with half the sword ?
what will you tell the people ?
all hail king arthur !
camelot is no longer the broken kingdom !
i give you excalibur , the sword pulled from the stone !
i see you followed your heart , king arthur .
and it led me back to you ...
queen guinevere .
something &apos;s wrong . tell me .
our journey wasn &apos;t all i hoped for .
merlin speaks in half @-@ truths .
and now my quest has only just begun .
you wanted to see me .
yes .
yes , we have something serious to discuss .
please , join me .
now that you &apos;re a member of the round table ,
it &apos;s time to share camelot &apos;s greatest secret .
the sword that made me king is broken .
for years , i &apos;ve hunted its missing piece ...
something known as the dagger of the dark one .
i &apos;ve heard tales of it .
well , i think you &apos;re the man to help me find it .
after all , you &apos;re the only one who needs it as bad as i.
you &apos;re desperate to destroy the power of the dark one .
only merlin can do that .
perhaps .
perhaps not .
no one knows what merlin really wants ,
but with that dagger , we wouldn &apos;t need merlin .
i could reforge excalibur into the sword it once was
with the power to destroy the darkness once and for all .
can you help me in this quest ?
do you hear it ?
a sweet sound .
a strange sound .
let &apos;s go have a look , shall we ?
so that &apos;s where it &apos;s coming from ...
your dagger .
since regina left it in her room ,
i say , uh , finders keepers .
so she put a spell on it . that &apos;s nothing for you .
shatter it .
i can &apos;t .
it &apos;s calling to its other half .
leave me alone .
your friends cannot protect you .
stop .
you &apos;re the savior .
save yourself before it &apos;s too late .
get out of my head !
calm down .
there &apos;s no one here .
it &apos;s just us .
you and me .
he &apos;s inside my head .
i can &apos;t get him out .
he &apos;s here .
he &apos;s always here .
what happened to her ?
i have no idea .
she hasn &apos;t said a word .
it &apos;s getting worse , isn &apos;t it ?
david , where have you been ?
i was looking all over the castle for you .
with arthur .
it turns out he might have a way to help emma .
we can &apos;t .
if we give him the dagger ...
david , listen to me . we can &apos;t trust arthur .
what are you talking about ? who told you that ?
lancelot .
lancelot ?
lancelot is dead .
that &apos;s what he wanted cora to think , but he outwitted her .
nnot in front of the patient ,
given the state that she &apos;s in ,
anything could set her off .
she needs rest ...
somewhere quiet and away from prying eyes .
i know the perfect place .
perhaps me and the boy should take her there .
come on , love . let &apos;s sail away .
whatever &apos;s happening to her ,
i think she was here for the dagger ,
so i should probably move it somewhere safer .
now , hold on a second .
arthur has a way to use that to help emma .
what did i just tell you ? we are not giving it to arthur .
lancelot said he can &apos;t be trusted .
and cora said lancelot was dead .
you can &apos;t believe everything you hear .
you really don &apos;t trust lancelot , do you ?
he married us . he &apos;s our friend .
that was a long time ago , and where &apos;s he been all these years ?
he didn &apos;t say .
well , where is he now ?
hiding . it &apos;s not like he &apos;s welcome in camelot .
because he went after arthur &apos;s wife .
and he &apos;s back . why ? why &apos;s he back ?
i don &apos;t know , david ! i don &apos;t have all the answers !
regina , would you mind please giving us a minute ?
listen , arthur is already looking for the dagger .
if we come clean now , he can still help us .
so that &apos;s what this is about .
you haven &apos;t met a king in a while , and you &apos;re star @-@ struck .
that &apos;s not what this is about .
our daughter is sick . we have to help her .
so why become a knight of the round table ?
how does that help her ?
or is it that you need to feel like a hero again ?
maybe the round table &apos;s exactly where i should be .
we aren &apos;t telling arthur anything
until we know he can be trusted .
don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s only me .
my queen . i &apos;m so glad to see you .
i &apos;ve almost translated the carmarthen scroll .
i had to pull language fragments from a dozen different books .
but can you believe how close we are to the other half ?
this time i &apos;m right .
directions to the dark one dagger as clear as day .
it &apos;s just these symbols i can &apos;t figure out ...
star , eye , and sun .
what do you think it means ?
it means ... come to the party ,
dance with your wife .
no , no , no , i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t .
not until i finish this translation .
don &apos;t you understand ? this is merlin &apos;s test .
why else would he lead me to this ?
the broken sword to rule the broken kingdom .
it &apos;s a cruel joke .
the world &apos;s most maddening riddle .
i know .
but this one night , your wife needs you .
you &apos;re right .
give me five minutes , and we shall dance until dawn .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be out shortly .
i &apos;m sure he will .
happy birthday , my queen .
thank you .
in the meantime ...
perhaps you &apos;ll allow this knight a dance .
he &apos;s getting worse ,
locked up in that room all day
instead of actually building the kingdom we dreamed of .
arthur may have much on his mind , but look around .
he did manage to throw you quite a party .
a birthday gift from king arthur to his queen guinevere !
middlemist flowers .
what &apos;s wrong ? you don &apos;t like them ?
i &apos;m not a fool .
i know he didn &apos;t plan any of this .
the fact that you won &apos;t deny it tells me all .
thank you .
where &apos;s my queen ?
you made it !
look ! i completed the translation .
the dagger is only a day &apos;s ride from here .
by this time tomorrow , i will hold it in my hand .
let me fetch my horse .
no . no , not this time , old friend .
i need my best knight to stay here and protect the queen .
after all , she is the most precious thing i have .
五年后
david ?
we need to talk .
ever since we came to camelot ,
we &apos;ve been lying to you about why we &apos;re here .
that stops right now .
it &apos;s not easy for me to be here ,
and people i care about told me not to ,
but the darkness is threatening someone i love ,
and i will do anything to destroy it .
so ...
we &apos;re gonna restore excalibur tonight .
i &apos;m glad you told me about your daughter .
of course i will help you defeat the darkness inside her .
that ... is a relief .
my wife thought this was a bad idea .
what put her off me ?
it &apos;s the beard , isn &apos;t it ?
something a bit more serious .
lancelot .
he &apos;s back .
五年前
you must not think much of me .
and what would i tell arthur
if his queen ran off on my watch ?
tell him i &apos;m going to find the dagger myself .
i broke into merlin &apos;s tower and took this --
a magic gauntlet --
and it has shown me the true location of the dagger .
arthur has it all wrong .
and how did arthur not find this remarkable magic object
in all his years of looking ?
he would never think to use it
because he believes the dagger will be his strength ,
and this gauntlet --
it leads you to a person &apos;s greatest weakness .
so i &apos;m going to finish this damned quest
and get back the man i love .
and you cannot stop me .
stop you ?
i &apos;m joining you .
i told you it would work .
this is it .
the vault of the dark one .
these symbols -- they are the same ones
arthur showed me on that damn scroll of his .
star ...
... eye ...
... sun .
shall we ?
this way .
lancelot !
no !
you cannot have him !
lancelot .
i thought you were dead .
i was sure i &apos;d lost you .
i &apos;m sorry .
that ... will never happen again .
no .
never .
we need to remember why we &apos;re here ...
for our king ...
for arthur .
五年后
lancelot &apos;s alive .
and here in camelot .
serious news , indeed .
can we keep this between ourselves ?
of course .
sometimes a husband has to go on the defensive .
i wouldn &apos;t want my wife to learn that he &apos;s here .
she already has .
where is lancelot ?
he doesn &apos;t know , my love .
so tell me how to find him .
so i can make him pay for what he did .
from what i heard , you both had some culpability in that .
‭ so you heard the old story ?
believe me , the legend is only the beginning .
lancelot coveted far more than a kiss from a queen .
i &apos;m afraid my wife is right .
i didn &apos;t want to speak ill of a former knight ,
a former friend ,
but if lancelot is in camelot ,
that dagger isn &apos;t safe anywhere .
then it &apos;s a good thing ...
i brought it with me .
where is it ?
you can come out . it &apos;s me .
it turns out i need your help .
there &apos;s something we must hide .
come on , mom . keep going .
we &apos;re almost there .
it &apos;s nice here , right ?
a good place to rest .
you &apos;ll feel better in no time .
it &apos;s a quiet and isolated little nook .
how did you turn up such a refuge , lad ?
well ... there &apos;s this girl .
is there , indeed ?
well , i like this tale already .
i @-@ it &apos;s not like that .
her name &apos;s violet . she brought me here .
the stable belongs to her family .
so you two are getting close ?
n @-@ not at all . we &apos;re just hanging out .
hello ? who &apos;s in there ?
that &apos;s her . hide . hide .
go on .
come on .
henry .
what are you doing here ?
i was wondering if you &apos;d be interested in taking me riding .
yeah . i &apos;d love to .
come on . i &apos;ll introduce you to nicodemus .
that your dad ?
no . it &apos;s my horse .
i hope you &apos;re ready to get your heart racing .
come on .
you can hide buried treasure or a winning poker hand ,
but you can &apos;t hide the bloom of first love .
yes , he has a crush .
and he straight @-@ up lied to my face .
and i &apos;m the dark one .
you &apos;re his mother .
which is scarier ?
to him ?
that &apos;s up for debate .
speaking of your dark one @-@ ness ,
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s time
you tell me the truth of what happened ?
it &apos;s rumplestiltskin .
or at least something that looks like him .
i &apos;ve been seeing him in my head ever since we got here .
he was there when we first found you ,
with the flame @-@ haired scot .
i almost crushed her heart because of his voice .
i &apos;ve spent many years battling demons in my head ,
and i was able to purge them on the prow of the jolly roger ,
riding the ocean &apos;s waves .
too bad you can &apos;t have it shrunk in your pocket right now .
well , we may not need it .
that girl promised to get henry &apos;s heart racing astride a horse .
you and i are gonna do the same .
you never told me what happened between you and guinevere .
it &apos;s complicated .
but what &apos;s happened is in the past .
it doesn &apos;t matter anymore .
it does if you still love her .
do you ?
yes .
i &apos;ll forever love guinevere .
the dagger lies beyond this door .
stand back .
we have no idea what trap remains .
there it is .
excalibur will finally be complete .
not exactly a sword in the stone ...
but it still does the trick .
so , that &apos;s how you found this place --
merlin &apos;s gauntlet .
that &apos;s quite a powerful object ,
at least for a wizard stuck in a tree .
that dagger is arthur &apos;s birthright ,
and you will surrender it to us .
so , that &apos;s king arthur &apos;s weakness , is it ?
so that must make you guinevere .
sadly , i can &apos;t give you what you want ,
though i might be willing to part with the next best thing ,
assuming , of course ,
you &apos;re willing to make a deal for that gauntlet .
what &apos;s the next best thing to completing a magical sword ?
making it appear like it &apos;s been completed ... with this .
enchanted sand from the mystical isle of avalon .
one pinch of this can &quot; fix &quot; anything .
even excalibur ?
your husband need never know .
after all , what &apos;s one little secret
if it means getting your husband back ?
assuming , of course , that &apos;s , uh , still what you want .
and why should i trust you ?
because i know what happens
when a woman &apos;s heart is torn between duty and desire .
and believe me ... it never ends well .
please , guinevere , don &apos;t listen to this demon .
i will accept your deal .
good girl !
but be careful .
love is a weapon , dearie --
the most dangerous weapon of all ,
which means the pain you should worry about
isn &apos;t the kind inflicted by a broken sword ,
but the kind that comes ...
from a broken heart .
we &apos;re here .
the vault of the dark one .
this place .
i &apos;ve been here before .
i had a vision .
i thought i understood what it meant ,
but maybe i was wrong .
maybe it was always about emma becoming the dark one .
what did you see ?
emma crushed my heart .
we have no time to waste .
we have to make sure that arthur can &apos;t get this dagger .
this altar is the place to secure it ,
but it &apos;s shielded by a nasty protection spell .
well , if it &apos;s meant to keep the dagger safe ,
then maybe a person holding it can be allowed past ?
wait .
it should be me .
you &apos;ve done enough .
you need to let me do this , snow .
what is it ?
don &apos;t you trust me ?
apparently not .
and that &apos;s a decision she &apos;s gonna regret .
arthur !
i wouldn &apos;t .
excalibur &apos;s blade is broken .
this one works just fine .
you followed us .
so i was right .
pity your husband didn &apos;t listen
when you tried to warn him .
where is he ?
searching for you ...
in the wrong place .
which means if you ever want to see him again ...
... you &apos;re gonna hand over that dagger .
hello , guinevere .
where were you ?
lancelot and i ...
went to find the dagger of the dark one .
and tell me , were you able to find it ?
yes .
it was where you said it would be --
in the dark one vault .
you mean to say you truly found it ?
well , where is it , then ?
give me the dagger !
i &apos;ll finally prove merlin wrong .
that i &apos;m not his fool !
that i &apos;m meant to be king of this god @-@ forsaken place !
it &apos;s not here !
where are you hiding the dagger from me ? !
the only thing i &apos;m hiding is this .
i couldn &apos;t get the dagger , so i got this instead .
enchanted sand
that can make something broken appear whole again .
well , that &apos;s why you came back --
to use magic to trick me !
yes !
i wanted you back ! to be the man i loved !
my king .
and now i realize i don &apos;t want any of it .
not unless it &apos;s real .
it can be .
you can have me back . you can have it all .
i just need the dagger .
tell me where the vault is !
don &apos;t you understand ? ! you have to make a choice !
stop trying to mend that sword ,
or your marriage
and your kingdom
will be broken forever .
and what if i can &apos;t ?
then i &apos;ll follow my heart to where it belongs .
with lancelot ?
i saw you .
it &apos;s not what you think .
he was saying goodbye . he &apos;s leaving camelot .
you expect me to believe that ?
i can &apos;t lose you to him , guinevere .
i won &apos;t .
i &apos;ll do whatever it takes to fix things .
arthur , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m sorry , guinevere ,
but my heart tells me i have to finish my quest .
and with this magic ,
i can keep you by my side to do it .
no !
so , my queen , how are you now ?
better ... i think .
middlemist flowers .
so beautiful .
do you remember the first time i gave one to you ?
of course .
it was the day you told me about merlin &apos;s prophecy --
a prophecy you have yet to complete .
and i ... have not been supportive enough .
i know how much getting that dagger means to you ,
so you can prove yourself to merlin .
yes , my queen .
but until then ,
i don &apos;t see why you can &apos;t live in the kingdom you deserve .
and i think it &apos;s time to fix this broken kingdom ,
don &apos;t you ?
give me the dagger ,
or i will put this sword through my oldest friend ,
like i should have done years ago .
no .
first you try and steal my wife ,
and now you want to deny me the dagger
after all i &apos;ve done for you !
please don &apos;t hurt him !
here .
i have waited a lifetime for this .
now i control your daughter .
i can command her to reunite the sword and free merlin .
excalibur &apos;s blade will be the last thing he sees
before i use it to run him through .
then i will use the blade
to snuff out the darkness once and for all .
i can become what no one thought i could --
the greatest king in all the realms .
dark one ,
i command you to appear !
i said i command you !
she &apos;s not coming .
why ? what have you done to the dagger ?
the dagger &apos;s not real .
how ?
you knew he would follow us .
she wasn &apos;t the only one .
well , i was wondering when you were gonna show up .
i had to keep my distance
so arthur wouldn &apos;t see me trailing him .
you betrayed me .
you broke the sacred trust of the round table .
you tried to trick me with a catchy title and a comfy chair .
david , you deserved a seat at my table .
every choice i &apos;ve made is for the good of camelot !
i &apos;m trying to destroy the darkness !
the darkness is in my daughter ,
so every choice i make is for the good of my family .
so this was all a show ?
are you even really fighting ?
oh , the fight was real .
oh , very real .
but we quickly realized
that fighting wasn &apos;t going to solve any problems ,
so we put aside our differences
and thought of emma &apos;s well @-@ being first .
beautiful animal , isn &apos;t she ?
the finest horse in all of camelot .
or at least the finest i could borrow
without anyone noticing .
i thought the plan was to ride the horse .
this feels a lot like walking .
this isn &apos;t like driving that yellow contraption of yours .
you can &apos;t just turn a key .
the horse has to trust you .
so , go on . introduce yourself .
well , i guess the pony &apos;s smarter than the pirate .
she knows what you are , dearie .
go away .
swan , stop talking to the demon in your head .
get on the horse .
this is pointless . i &apos;m the dark one . what &apos;s this going to do ?
this isn &apos;t about the bloody horse , emma .
this is about you putting your faith in me ,
in our future .
you still think we can get back there ,
to storybrooke and some white @-@ picket @-@ fence life ?
yes .
i &apos;ll never stop fighting for us .
all you have to do is trust me .
this &apos;ll work .
finally a blade that can stand up to granny &apos;s meatloaf .
so , now what do we do with it ?
well , arthur wanted to reunite it with the dagger
and use it for evil .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that it couldn &apos;t also be used for good .
like helping emma .
we can talk more about it
as soon as we get back to camelot
and put someone worthy in charge .
i spent a lifetime putting my faith in a false king .
camelot &apos;s true leader ...
is its queen -- guinevere .
is it me , or is he unusually quiet ?
because he knows something .
gwen .
what &apos;s going on ?
why are you doing this ?
i love him .
no .
it &apos;s not real .
he must have used the sands of avalon on you .
guinevere , we can break this spell .
not interested .
take this traitor to the dungeon where he belongs .
you &apos;re not the only couple with hearts that beat as one .
the second you lock us up ,
our friends will know something &apos;s wrong ,
and your secret &apos;s out .
who said we &apos;re locking you up ?
we &apos;re hoping you can help .
never .
oh , actually , i &apos;m quite optimistic .
guinevere .
fix this , my love .
someone doesn &apos;t like you .
that &apos;s the cell the rats take a fancy to .
i had a disagreement with the king .
didn &apos;t make me a lot of friends .
it might have made you one .
because an enemy of king arthur is probably a friend of mine .
i &apos;m merida .
lancelot .
you &apos;re going to wear out the masonry if you keep pacing .
i &apos;m sure david and mary margaret are fine .
you think i &apos;m worried about them ?
those two can outlive a cockroach .
i want to know how their test went .
i get antsy when i don &apos;t know who i should hate .
i think we can help with that .
what took so long ?
turns out david was right .
we can trust arthur .
and lancelot ?
locked safely in the dungeon . he was lying .
our best move now is to give arthur the real dagger .
i just spent all day hiding it , like we agreed upon .
plans change .
making excalibur whole is our best chance to help emma .
that was amazing . thank you .
well , i had a feeling you would like it .
tell me .
what do you see ?
lots of flowers .
very good .
now ...
what don &apos;t you see ?
rumplestiltskin .
he &apos;s gone .
i hoped he might be .
by trusting me with your burden ,
you &apos;ve left no room for him in that head of yours .
well , now that we &apos;re alone ...
今时今日
i remember how the darkness feels .
but you don &apos;t have to give in to it .
you just ...
you could just set me free .
the only one who can get me that sword is you .
i can &apos;t be the hero you want .
of course you can .
you &apos;re like a dull knife sitting in a drawer .
but don &apos;t worry .
i have just the thing to sharpen you up .
what ?
we &apos;ll call it my secret weapon .
i should have trusted my gut when i first met you .
you are a witch .
i should have trusted my gut , kept that heart of yours .
now you &apos;re gonna kill me ? you coward !
no more talking .
go pick up the bow .
you see , there &apos;s a guy i know .
you wouldn &apos;t like him . he &apos;s a real coward .
but for me to get what i want , that needs to change .
i need you to make him just like you .
i need you to make him brave .
