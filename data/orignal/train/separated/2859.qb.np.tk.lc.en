she could fit in that little pocket inside the pocket .
i don &apos;t know . i like her a lot ,
and she &apos;s really nice , but .... but what ?
she keeps punching me .
in the cute , little sweet way she just did ?
it &apos;s a lot harder than it looks.she &apos;s hurting me .
i know what you need . you need a bodyguard .
what is ben doing after preschool ?

i brought you some housewarming gifts .
salt , so your life always has flavor .

and a scented candle for the bathroom.because , well , you know .
thanks . thanks . and thanks , i guess .
welcome . i &apos;m steve cera , president of the tenants &apos; committee .
ross geller . and this is my friend phoebe .
hi phoebe . mr. president .
i came to talk to you about howard .
he is the handyman who &apos;s retiring next week .
everyone who lives here is kicking in $ 100 as a kind of a thank you .
that &apos;s nice.want to give me a check ?
not now . you can slip it under my door .
no , it &apos;s not that.i just moved in .
well , the guy &apos;s worked here for 25 years .
yes , but i &apos;ve lived here for 25 minutes .
okay , i get it .
wait ! look , i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s just i &apos;ve never even met howard .
i mean , i don &apos;t know howard.howard &apos;s the handyman .
yes , but to me , he &apos;s just &quot; man . &quot;
okay . fine . whatever.welcome to the building .
can you believe that guy ?
i really like his glasses .
so then president steve told everyone i was a cheapskate ... and now the whole building hates me .
a little kid spit on my knee .
and told me to wipe it off with my $ 100 bill .
you really should wipe it off with something .
you know what ? i &apos;ll throw a party . for everyone in the building .
and i &apos;ll sit them all down and explain that i am not a bad guy .
i am not a cheap guy . i &apos;m just a guy ... who stands up for what he believes in.a man with principles .
sounds like a fun party .
if you want them to like you , why don &apos;t you just pay the $ 100 ?
the party will cost you more .
that doesn &apos;t matter ! it &apos;s my principles ! we &apos;re talking about my principles !
i thought it was about your neighbors liking you .
they &apos;ll like me once they come to my awesome party .
i gotta get some nametags .
and that crazy party animal will be your brother @-@ in @-@ law .
very funny . but don &apos;t say that to monica.don &apos;t put any ideas in her head .
you do realize that those ideas are probably already in monica &apos;s head ?
why ?
well , because she loves you and because you love her .
yeah , so ? what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
don &apos;t freak out ! i &apos;m telling you something you already know .
she left richard because he didn &apos;t want to have babies .
and she is a woman . and she &apos;s almost 30 . and , you know , it &apos;s monica .
i don &apos;t see it that way . i see two monicas .
my friend who lives across the hall and wants a lot of babies .
and the new monica who i started to date .
now , who is to say what she wants ?
i &apos;m right .
am i right ?
oh , absolutely.i &apos;m completely different from richard .
he &apos;s an eye doctor , and i don &apos;t wear glasses .
you &apos;re right.you &apos;re absolutely right . that makes everything different .
it &apos;s not different , is it ? not unless different means &quot; the same . &quot;
you were so funny with that waiter . you &apos;re such a nut !
you know , bread @-@ stick fangs are always funny .
no , you make them funny . you &apos;re the funny one !
look , katie . listen , we need to talk , okay ?
look , i like you . i really do . i like you a lot .
but sometimes when you playfully punch me like that ...
... it feels like i &apos;m being hit with a very tiny but a very real bat !
like i could hurt you.are you making fun of my size ?
don &apos;t make fun of me because of my size !
isn &apos;t this great ?
couldn &apos;t you just stay like this forever ?
couldn &apos;t you just stay here forever ?
yeah , here , somewhere else . you know , wherever .
are you okay ? i &apos;m cool.casual.
what are you doing ?
just hanging out . having fun with the girl that i &apos;m seeing casually .
man , i knew it ! i knew you &apos;d do this .
what ? get all freaked out because everybody was joking about marriage !
well , you do want all that stuff , right ? you know what i want ?
yes ! you want babies ! you have baby fever !
i do not have baby fever !
you &apos;re obsessed with babies and marriage ...
... and everything that &apos;s related to babies and marriage .
why don &apos;t we turn the heat down on this pressure cooker !
have you lost your mind ? this isn &apos;t about me . this is about you and your weird commitment crap !
i know you . i know the thoughts that you have in your head .
you don &apos;t know everything .
did you know i &apos;m going out with rachel tonight instead of you ?
and that the only baby here is you ?
did you know i can &apos;t even look at you now ?
i did not know that .
it &apos;ll be okay , right ? she won &apos;t leave me . this is fixable .
yeah , sure .
absolutely .
by me ? oh no no
unless you make some big gesture.big , though .
the missus !
gunther , can i get a coffee ?
to go .
i still don &apos;t want to talk to you .
tell me how to make things right .
what ? that &apos;s what we do.i mess up ,
you tell me how to fix it and i do.and then you think i &apos;m cute again
i &apos;m really tired of being your relationship tutor.figure this out for yourself .
if you &apos;re afraid of a real relationship ... then don &apos;t be in one .
howard ! howard ! howard !
phoebe ? phoebe
hi , ross !
what are you doing here ?
i thought this was your party , and it &apos;s a party for howard .
he &apos;s the sweetest little man .
see you , phoebe . and thanks for chipping in.oh , sure .
you chipped in ? yeah , $ 100
i can &apos;t believe you gave him money .
i thought you agreed it was unreasonable that they asked me for that money .
but they didn &apos;t ask me .
i &apos;m just the exotic , generous stranger . that &apos;s always fun to be .
but you &apos;re making me look bad .
no , i &apos;m not ! if anything , i &apos;m making you look better .
they &apos;ll see you talking to me . i &apos;m a hit .
hey , phoebe !
hey , ross.maybe you two could switch apartments.because phoebe is more our kind of people .
think about it .
okay , my bad .
you look big .
thanks , i &apos;ve been working out .
listen , is it obvious i &apos;m wearing six sweaters ?
ya but it &apos;s not obvious why .
i &apos;m breaking up with katie , so i put on some extra padding .
if she hits me when she is happy , ...
can you imagine how hard she &apos;ll hit ... when i take away the joey love ?
oh , right . i forgot that you call it that .
hey , cute jacket .
thanks.that &apos;s so sweet !
ouch !
did joey tell you to say that ? you guys are too much !
you know what ? i gotta tell you ... i think you &apos;re the one that is too much .
joey has the nicest friends .
and the nicest girlfriend .
you &apos;re so sweet !
you &apos;re so sweet !
joey she just kicked me .
aren &apos;t you going to do something ?
do something or i &apos;ll walk out that door right now .
are you going to ?
nah
phoebe
that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying
phoebe ? phoebe ?
this is a disaster . can &apos;t i please just go ?
i &apos;m talking you up to people .
give it some time , relax . get something to eat .
what did you tell them about me ?
i told them about you and emily . trying to get some sympathy .
but you came off as the bad guy .
what ? i told it wrong .
we should talk about that because i don &apos;t understand what happened there .
this cake is really good !
things are looking up .
oh , my god ! someone cut howard &apos;s cake !
who would do a thing like that ?
3b
you got your free food . you ruined everyone &apos;s fun.isn &apos;t it time you went home ?
yeah get out now
go back to 3b , 3b .
everyone , calm down ! i have something that i &apos;d like to say .
who here likes ross ?
of course you don &apos;t like him .
he didn &apos;t give you any money.he raised his own hand when i asked , &quot; who likes ross ? &quot;
and he &apos;s wearing two nametags .
i &apos;ll be honest . when i first met ross , i didn &apos;t like him at all .
once i got to know him , i saw that he is really sweet ... and caring and very generous .
all i &apos;m saying is , don &apos;t judge ross before you get to know him .
you know , i like all of you guys now . but when i first met you , you know ?
kurt ? i thought , abrasive drunk .
lola ? mind @-@ numbingly stupid .
you guys . gold digger , cradle @-@ robbing perv .
so i think you all know what i mean .
obviously , i didn &apos;t think they would throw things .
i thought if i kept insulting them you &apos;d defend them .
then you &apos;d look like the hero.oh wow yeah
see , i did not get that .
where &apos;s monica ? i need to talk to her , it &apos;s urgent .
i &apos;m monica .
i need to talk to you . it &apos;s urgent .
i &apos;ve been thinking ... about us . a lot of &quot; us &quot; thinking .
i guess there &apos;s only one way to do this .
what are you doing ?
monica ... don &apos;t do it .
will you marry me ?
what a bad idea .
i can &apos;t not look at it .
why are you doing this ? i don &apos;t know .
but i know i &apos;m not afraid to do this .
i &apos;m doing this because i &apos;m sorry ?
do you think the best reason to get married is because you &apos;re sorry ?
the best reason is pregnancy .
sorry is fourth , behind being ready and actually wanting to get married .
will you be my wife ?
i want you to take a minute and think about how ridiculous this sounds .
i &apos;m kind of wishing everyone wasn &apos;t here now .
none of that came from me.i never said i wanted to have babies and get married !
i was really confused . then i talked to these guys .
who ? two divorces and joey ?
she &apos;s right , you know ?
yeah , but still , cheap shot !
you know when i said that i want you ... to deal with relationship stuff all on your own ?
you &apos;re not ready.i didn &apos;t think i was !
oh , my god.what would you have done if i had said yes ?
i would &apos;ve been happy because ... i would spend the rest of my life with the woman i love .
or you would have seen a chandler @-@ shaped hole in that door .
will you pass that knife ? no , i will not .
you don &apos;t have to be mean about it .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry . will you marry me ?
i was going to ask you to marry me because i didn &apos;t say hello to you .
oh no wait pheebs , i think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you . but i &apos;m not sure , chandler ?
how long is this going to go on ?
i think the length of teasing ... is directly related to how insane you were . so a long time .
this is fun ! remember that &quot; we were on a break &quot; thing ?
i &apos;m sorry . will you marry me ?
