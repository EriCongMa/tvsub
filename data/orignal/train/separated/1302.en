What are you doing?
Caught me. I was eating into the profits.
I told you to leave the load, pick it up in two hours.
Sorry. I'm on my way.
Wait.
Boss wants to meet you first.
Sure.
Come on.
Get on your knees.
Don't.
Please.
I can forget about it.
Put your hands up.
Boss wants to see if you can catch.
Somebody's here.
Maura, you're staring at Chuck's biceps.
I am.
Females are wired to be attracted
to the strongest, most dominant males.
It's natural selection at work.
You're making me uncomfortable. Stop.
What?
I'm just appreciating his sternocleidomastoid.
Excuse me.
You have beautifully developed musculature.
What, am I embarrassing you?
No, not at all. Why don't you tell him he's got a nice ass, too?
And a wonderfully proportioned gluteus maximus.
I am never working out with you again.
Right.
Hey, where you going? That was only 20 minutes.
Oh, Bass is ill.
He won't even eat any organic spinach.
I got to go check on him.
You brought your turtle to work?
Tortoise.
I couldn't get his usual caregiver.
Rizzoli.
Hey, it's Murray.
Hey...Murray. What's up?
Can't find your parents about the head count.
Figure they must be at church.
Head count for what?
The surprise party.
Surprise party for who?
"Whom."
Shh. What are you talking about?
Oh, I thought you knew.
Sorry, didn't mean to bother you.
Too late, I'm bothered.
Frankie?
What?
Know anything about ma and pop throwing a surprise party today?
Oh, no.
"Oh, no" is right.
What is this?
Cups. You wanted cups.
Why can't you ever do what I ask?
They were 70% off, Ang.
I wanted the toile ones,
with the blue-and-green pattern.
It's a cup, Ang. It's a cup!
You put something into it...what is it?
Sorry about that call.
I think they wanted to surprise you.
Surprise.
I couldn't reach you.
What are you doing?
We're gonna have a family get-together,
and I was gonna call you the minute we were set up.
Really? Pop, you want to, uh, spit it out.
Uh, ask your mother.
Welcome home, Tommy
He's coming home?
He's getting out today.
Bus gets in at 2:00.
He's getting out early?
For good behavior.
Oh. Too bad he can't behave unless he's behind bars.
Don't say that about your brother.
He made a mistake. He served his time.
Everybody makes mistakes, Jane.
Running a priest down in a crosswalk
on your third D.U.I. conviction
is not a "mistake."
Father Crowley has forgiven him.
Why can't you?
You're throwing him a party in a bar.
Mom, are you crazy?
Technically, we're a bar and grill.
And we're only serving soda pop.
I thought that was just till the cake.
Murray.
What makes you think he's gonna make it out here?
Easy, Jane. Take it easy.
She's right. You have to have a plan.
He comes back. He works for me.
Oh, and he sleeps in his bunk bed
and plays with his toy soldiers.
Yeah, that ought to straighten him right out, pop.
That's my son, and it's your brother.
Look, if you and Frankie don't want to come, don't.
Fine. Not coming.
Me either.
You're gonna turn your back on this family?
Come on, Ma.
Ma. Ma, we're both cops.
You can't expect us to do this.
Rizzoli.
What?
What?
Oh, no.
Okay.
What happened?
We got a cop shot.
Danny Clark, drug control unit.
He was in my class at the academy.
Wife, two kids.
Knew his father.
I knew Danny since he was this tall.
It's a damn shame.
One shot to the head.
Looks like a large-caliber firearm.
It's a 45-caliber.
Abrasions on his sternum.
And some hair's missing.
There's a piece of tape. Hey, Joe.
Uh, photograph this, mark it, and bag it, okay?
He was wearing a wire.
He was working for us.
Homicide?
Yeah.
Since when?
I sent him under to get information
about the two dead truckers from Charlestown you were working.
My case? Without telling me?
It's my decision.
Everyone fall in over here.
What the hell?
Let's go.
I want every cop and detective
down here working the streets on this.
Get everyone from headquarters.
The only cop I want there is manning the front desk
until further notice.
You. You!
If you'd kept us together on this,
Danny wouldn't be dead.
Come on, easy, easy.
He wouldn't be dead!
You better have a good reason for sending him in alone.
A good reason.
Bobby.
Look, I need you, Rizzoli.
Yes, sir.
I want you to interview Bobby.
He may not even know what he knows.
Now, you're the best at this.
Take him to headquarters.
I-I can interview him here.
No, no, no, no. Get him out of here.
Yes, sir.
I know. I know.
Jane.
Yeah?
That's the only thing I found in his pockets.
I'll, uh -- I'll bag it and get it to evidence.
Frankie, you want to...?
Hey, man, come on, come on. Let's -- let's go.
Okay?
Ugh! What a Sunday.
What? No, no, no. No, no, no.
$20's, uh, overkill.
You're only a jerk if you don't leave anything. Here.
God, when was that made? November?
Marino wants a cup of coffee. There's none upstairs.
Guy's a wreck.
I've tried everything --
British strawberries, fennel, bok choy.
Are -- are we in the same conversation?
Sorry. I-I was talking about Bass.
Oh. You're obsessing over your turtle again?
Tortoise.
He likes salt in his coffee?
Oh, damn it.
You know, when people lock their keys in their car
or sprain their ankle,
usually indicates that something significant is bothering them.
Yeah. A cop was murdered.
Yeah. But that's --
that's not why you're salting your coffee.
It's my brother Tommy.
I always wondered about him.
Well, Frankie and I became cops.
And Tommy went to prison
for hitting a priest in a crosswalk.
It was his third strike while driving under the influence.
Your poor parents.
And, you know, they keep saying,
"If the priest that he hit has forgiven him,
then why can't we?"
This isn't about forgiveness.
You know, Tommy is -- is really troubled.
And the more they deny it, the more he screws up.
You really care about him.
I just think that we need to face reality.
You know, Tommy needs help.
This isn't like he broke his leg and it'll heal.
I'm really sorry.
Thank you.
Don't worry about it.
We got too much to do today to worry about Tommy.
Wish you were out there?
Yeah.
We'll get the shooter.
I'll call you as soon as I get the results.
All right.
Oh, I got to log this into evidence.
I got to take this to Marino.
I'll see you later.
Jane.
Yeah?
If you want to talk about your brother...
or just avoid the subject, I'm here.
I know.
According to Danny's notes,
you guys were making inroads into the trucker homicides.
Why'd you stop working the case?
Cavanaugh pulled me off the murders.
Went back to working drugs in Charlestown.
And then there's -- there's nothing.
Do you know what was Danny doing for Cavanaugh?
Beats me.
Got real secretive all of a sudden.
What? You guys were partners for years.
Why would he shut you out?
We were partners for nine years.
Danny was the best.
I know.
But...
I mean, you worked drugs. You know what it's like.
All that money's...
Well, I knew Danny, too, Bobby.
What are you trying to say?
Hey. Help me out here.
I think Danny was dirty.
Jane.
Yeah?
Sector six officers brought in a woman
they arrested outside the warehouse last night.
What, where Danny was shot?
Yep. They grabbed her for crack.
She says that she can give up the shooter.
If we broom her case?
Yeah.
She's waiting in the interview room.
Okay.
Want me to go talk to her?
Yeah, yeah.
All right.
Okay, I'll be right back.
Nice.
Did you see his face?
I'm not saying anything
until I know that I'm not doing time.
You withhold information about the murder of a Boston cop,
and you're going back -- no trial, no nothing.
You'll be eating dinner in jail.
He was a cop? I didn't know that he was a cop, okay?
This is bad. This is really bad.
This is so bad!
Sit down. You're not going anywhere.
Did you see his face?
Yeah.
I did -- the both of them.
They are really bad guys. They're really bad guys.
And they're gonna come here, and they're gonna kill me.
Can you pick them out?
Yeah.
But I don't know what to do. What am I supposed to do?
Okay.
I have no p-- what am I supposed to do?
Okay, listen to me.
If they were willing to shoot a cop,
they won't think twice about killing you.
Okay, thanks. I'll let them know.
What can I do for you, fellas?
Yeah, my vehicle got towed. How do I get it back?
You have to head over to division.
Get his weapon.
Set up the cellphone jammer. Kill the power.
Go to the roof. Take out the antenna and the junction box.
Keep eyes on the streets.
You, cover the back exit by the morgue.
You're coming with me. We don't have much time.
Oh, my god. They're here!
What? No.
They're here. I told you.
I told you. - It's a power failure. Calm --
No, they're here. They're here. No.
Everybody meet at the loading docks in 10 minutes.
Go.
Jimmy, the power's out.
Get his weapon.
Let's go.
Oh, shoot!
Bass.
Just the power's out, okay?
Hey, buddy, but I still need you to eat something.
Sweetie, here we go. Come on, sweetie.
There. Quick, quick!
Right there in the evidence locker.
Hit it.
Where is it? I don't see it.
Damn it!
It's not here. Let's go.
They know I'm here. They know I'm here!
I got to get out of here!
I got to get out of here.
No.
I'm getting out of here. I got to get out of here right now.
My gun.
Come on, go. Go to that door.
Go, go.
I got to get out of here!
Shh! Go up!
I got to get out of here. I got to get out of here.
Shh! Go up! Go up! Up, up, up.
I'm going.
There, right there. Go in the corner.
Yeah. Shh.
Don't leave me. Don't leave me.
Okay.
Don't go.
I got to go back down there and help them, okay?
I will be right back. You're safer here.
Are you okay?
She's dead.
Got here a second too late.
Not for me. Thank you. Can you walk?
Yeah.
But we can't get out of here.
They're watching all the exits.
Who are they?
I don't know.
I told her I could protect her.
If they were here to kill a witness, why aren't they gone?
What'd she say?
She said she saw Danny's shooter.
Said she could I.D. him.
You get a name?
No, no, nothing.
They ripped apart all the desks in the squad room.
What are they looking for?
I don't know.
The, uh -- that walkie -- is it working?
Only channel 12.
All homicide is out of range.
What do you think?
I got to find Maura and get her out of here.
Jane?
Jane!
Frankie?
Maura.
Maura.
It's Jane. It's Jane.
Jane. I was hiding.
There are men. There are men shooting in here.
Yeah. Both of them have been shot.
No, I'm fine, I'm fine. Take care of him.
Oh, my god. What happened?
He's been hit twice.
It's all right. My vest stopped it.
Okay, get him up here.
The table? Already? Really? The dead-person table?
Come on.
God. Okay, careful. Careful, careful.
Keep this, okay? A-and watch the doors.
I'm gonna stay with Frankie.
Take his shirt off.
Jane, what is going on?
The phones don't work. There are men shooting here.
I know, I know.
And I think we're trapped in here.
What about that?
No, that's -- that's only for homicide cops,
and -- and no one's in range.
Okay, lift his shirt up.
Okay, okay, okay.
I think I just got the wind knocked out of me. That's all.
You sure did.
Hand us that binder -- the binder on the desk.
We need to keep his head up.
Jane, give me your jacket.
Okay.
Careful, okay? We're gonna put you down.
All right.
Okay, got your head.
It's okay.
Got it? Okay.
ABC's --
airway, breathing, circulation.
I should've taken an emergency-medicine rotation.
All right, take a deep breath.
I-I-I can't.
What are you hearing?
J-Jane, you can't -- hey.
It's all -- it's fine, okay?
It's fine.
It's bad, isn't it?
Massive blunt-force trauma caused internal bleeding.
It's worse than bad.
Jenny, if any fingerprints come up on the bruise,
I want to see.
Yes, sir.
Any result I wanna hear about it,
any prints come up, let me know.
Peruvian flake always looks like mother of pearl.
Why'd they leave the drugs?
Killed a cop.
Something must've spooked them.
Was there a drug aspect to your two murders?
No.
Investigation showed random shootings --
two truckers hauling freight from New York.
I don't want anybody in here who doesn't belong.
I want you to go over this truck top to bottom...
Obviously, there's a lot more to this case.
I want the wheels checked, everything.
Why wouldn't Cavanaugh tell you
he was putting Danny undercover?
I don't know!
But what do you want to bet
my two dead truckers were muling coke?
What do you think Cavanaugh had to do with it?
Nothing, I hope.
Let's find out.
Pull up Danny's files on the truckers.
Why does everybody always use their birth date? Here it is.
Got their application for commercial driver's licenses.
When did they join the interstate truckers union?
Both got their I.T.U. Cards 18 months ago...
on the same day.
Check the union-card prints,
see if either one of them has a criminal record.
Didn't you check their autopsy prints?
Of course I did. They came up clean.
Just run the union-card prints, would you?
They're clean, too.
Okay.
Compare the prints from his union card
with the prints we took at the autopsy.
Can't fake your prints when you're dead.
Look at those whorl patterns.
There is no way those are from the same guy.
Did Danny keep their files in his personal records?
Right here.
Okay, open those.
Look at this.
Our trucker has multiple arrests
for possession of class-b cocaine.
He used someone else's prints to get his license.
Somebody pulled their records off the system.
And somehow Danny got hold of them.
Call Jane. I want to talk to Bobby.
Getting voicemail.
She's probably still interviewing him.
See what Danny has on our second dead trucker.
I need an MRI or CT scan, an -- an x-ray machine --
something to check his internal injuries.
I was afraid of that.
What?
Tension pneumothorax.
Maura, he's having trouble breathing. Do something.
I'm a pathologist. I am not a surgeon.
Jane, I could make it worse.
What is it again? Say it again.
T-tension pneumothorax.
Okay.
What are you doing?
"Tension pneumothorax results in death
if not -- if not treated immediately."
Oh, god.
Jane, I'm just guessing, okay?
I -- I would need to confirm it.
You don't have time to confirm it!
Your guess is better than most doctors'.
I could be wrong.
"Aggressively manage with needle decompression to chest."
I've never done it.
Maura!
Geez! G-get a needle. Do it.
Do it now!
All right.
Get a -- get alcohol and a cotton ball and -- and tape.
I got it. I got it.
All right, now, hold on, okay?
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Give me the tape.
Okay, hold this.
Hey, bud. Hey, buddy.
You're okay.
Hey, you're all right. You're all right.
The integrity of his chest wall
has been breached by a broken rib.
We got to get him to a hospital.
There's at least three man inside this building,
maybe more outside.
What are they carrying?
I saw two MP5s.
N-no. No. No, he looks better. He -- he looks better.
No, not for long.
I think he has a partial tear on one of his lungs,
maybe other internal organs.
Which -- which means what?
It means that he needs surgery.
How soon?
Now!
Hey, Ang.
Remember when we took the kids to Lake Winnipesaukee?
You know, when we took them all fishing?
Yes. And we had the rowboat that leaked.
Oh, yeah!
And Janie caught that largemouth bass, you know?
She was holding it up. She was so proud.
Oh, god, and Tommy had to throw it back in
because he didn't want that fish to die.
I still believe that person is inside of him.
Yeah. Me too, honey.
Is that me?
Hello?
Tommy!
Oh, baby, it's so good to hear your voice.
What?
Of course you are.
We're all here waiting for you.
W-what's he saying, Ang? G-give me the phone.
Tommy, please. Tommy.
We are all so happy that you're coming home.
Hey, give me the phone.
Tommy?
Tommy, listen to me.
Tommy, you come home!
Gimme.
Tommy?
What? T-tommy, no.
No. W-- listen.
Don't do this to your mother.
Tommy, please.
Danny and Bobby both worked Charlestown for nine years.
Yeah. And both our dead truckers lived in Charlestown.
Any connection to Danny or Bobby?
Nothing I can find.
Cavanaugh worked Charlestown.
I want to talk to Bobby. Try Jane again.
Voicemail.
Try the front desk.
Getting a recording.
I don't like it. Come on, let's go back to headquarters.
It's okay, buddy. We're gonna get you out of here.
There's blood clotting it.
Oh, turn him on his side!
What's happening?!
It's okay. It's okay. He falls away.
Oh, my god.
His lung is filling up with blood.
Well, how do we stop it?
We can't. We need a trauma center.
I-I-I don't have equipment for this.
But you helped him before.
The problem is his heart right now, Jane, okay?
There's too much pressure from the bleeding.
His heart can't pump.
Please don't let him die, Maura, please.
We -- we can't get him out of here, okay?
What can you do right now that will help him?
I don't know!
I don't know what more I can do with what I have!
He is going to die right here on this table
if you don't do something -- think!
Okay. Okay.
You're the only one that can save him.
It's all right, buddy. All right.
Rizzoli's car is still here.
Where's it coming from?!
On the roof! North and south corners!
Get to the radio.
Why me?
On me. I'm closer to retirement. You ready?
Go!
We're taking fire!
We got shooters on the roof of headquarters!
Get me some help down here now!
This is a hospital procedure.
Okay. Just do it.
I don't have anesthetic.
It's all right, Maura. Just do the best you can, okay?
Frankie...
this is gonna hurt, okay?
I have to drain the blood from your lung so you can breathe.
Maura, hurry.
I need you to hold him down for me.
Okay.
It's okay, bud. It's all right.
Have to insert the tube to drain the blood.
Okay.
We trust you.
This is painful.
Okay. Bud, listen to me.
Hey, hey! Look at me, all right?
This is gonna hurt, okay?
I want you to squeeze my hand as hard as you can, Frank.
Get down! Shooter on the roof!
What do we got?
A mess is what we got!
You tell me right now what you had to do with this!
If you're any part of it, I'll kill you myself!
Who the hell you think you're talking to?!
I sent Danny in there by himself!
His murder's on me!
Okay.
We got to get people out.
We think Rizzoli and Marino are in there.
Dr. Isles and Frankie are probably in there, too.
One shooter at the rear entry to the morgue.
Snipers are moving into position.
How many inside?
We've got a visual on one, in the lobby.
Got to figure out how to communicate.
We're gonna go old school. Use channel 12.
Frost, give me a walkie.
Jane never carries hers!
Maybe we'll get lucky.
Jane, you hear me?
Jane, can you hear me?
Do you copy?
Korsak, is that you?
Jane. Where are you?
W-we're in the autopsy room.
Are you okay?
We got a-at least two dead, two wounded.
Marino's got a gunshot wound to the thigh.
Frankie took two to the chest. He's -- he's hurt real bad.
Can you hold them off, Jane?
Not for long.
Th-they're looking for something.
Oh, wait, wait.
They -- they -- they were
looking for something in the evidence lockers.
B-but they didn't find whatever it s.
What, you're telling me this now?
I'm sorry. I kind of had my hands full.
Jane, did you log in any evidence from the crime scene?
Uh, uh, only the -- the pack of cigarettes,
but I haven't logged them in yet.
Why? What -- what do they want with Danny's cigarettes?
Danny doesn't smoke. His old man died of lung cancer.
So there's something in the cigarette pack.
Yeah, like what? Where is it?
Uh... Oh, it's right here.
Drop it.
You...
drop the radio.
Jane? Jane, what's happening?!
Give me the cigarettes.
You got till I count to three, or this cop is dead.
One...
Two...
All right, all right! They're right there.
Don't you screw with me.
Just stop, all right?
They're in my jacket, under his head.
Get them.
It's all right.
Here.
Give them to Bobby.
Smile.
You're on Danny's camera.
Danny didn't know that you were running the drug ring,
but he must've suspected something.
That's why he was wearing a wire and carrying a hidden camera.
He just couldn't stop digging.
That was Danny.
I wasn't planning on killing him,
but he showed up at the warehouse.
He didn't leave me any choice.
You killed the other witness, too, didn't you?
What's one less crack whore, right?
You son of a bitch.
Nah. I'm not a son of a bitch.
I'm a freakin' hero.
Now that I got what I need...
...I'm just gonna sit tight...
and wait to be rescued.
That is, after I shoot the three of you.
I wouldn't do that, Bobby.
Bobby, it's over.
Sniper 1, you've got a green light on that shot.
Take it.
Get your team into the morgue now!
Team 1, move, move, move! Team 3, move, move!
Come on, come on.
No, no, no, no!
It's fine.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
Tell them to hold their fire!
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
I've got a visual -- one shooter, one hostage.
Bobby, let her go! It's over!
Can you make the shot?
He's got her too tight.
Bobby, please, this is over! Please!
Drop the gun, Bobby! Don't make it worse on yourself!
Let her go!
Take out your keys.
Please! Frankie is bleeding!
Shut up and do it! Take out your keys!
Shoot him!
Just shoot him!
Put your guns down, or she's dead!
No, don't! Frankie's bleeding! There's no time!
Your brother's probably already dead.
No-o-o!
