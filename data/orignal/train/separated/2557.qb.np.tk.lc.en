take that , kite @-@ eating tree .
* go to sleep *
* little marge *
* close your eyes *
* start to yawn *
* you will wake up with the dawn *
* dawn *
* dawn *
* dawn *
large fries .
yes , sir .
* dawn *
did you get the baby to sleep ?
oh , no .
oh , i can &apos;t read that again .
i hate to see a wolf get punished
for having normal appetites .
i &apos;ll tell you a story that &apos;ll put you to sleep .
it &apos;s one your mother told me .
luann van houten uses flavored crisco
instead of butter for shortbread cookies .
which is , apparently , flakier ,
but at what cost ?
and she ...
wh ... ? huh ?
what the ... ?
okay , sweetie , i got a story
about another little girl who got lost in the woods ,
but it wasn &apos;t a girl ,
and it wasn &apos;t the woods .
suck , suck , indeed .
and it all happened once upon a time ,
before you were born ,
and my chances for a man cave
went out the window .
bless you all for sacrificing your saturday afternoon
to help us clean up skid row .
when god came for sunday , i said nothing .
now he comes for saturday .
homer simpson , it &apos;s one thing to moan and groan on the bus ,
but in front of these unfortunates ,
well , that just curls my &apos; stache .
hey , flanders , why don &apos;t you take some advice
from your bible and zip it ?
oh , where does the bible say zip it ?
it &apos;s the first thing the burning bush said to moses .
thank you for teaching us scripture .
thank you .
you know , all this helping others
is giving me the most satisfying feeling ever .
so satisfying .
uh , lenny ...
i get why they do it . totally get it .
hey , carl , you want to buy all my stuff for five dollars ?
well , thank you all for spending the day
thinking of others instead of yourselves .
saturday . it was a saturday .
now , a reward to the most selfless cleaner :
a family vacation to the grand canyon .
the winner : ned flanders .
surprise , surprise .
the guy that did the best job wins .
but this gift certificate is for two families .
hey , reverend , we &apos;d love it if you and helen would join us .
of course we &apos;d love to join you ,
but i &apos;ve noticed that you and homer
haven &apos;t been the friendliest &quot; neighboreenos , &quot;
if you get my diddly .
uh , well , ned , i think the lord would want you
to take the simpsons on this trip .
our lord ?
yes . our lord .
for would it not indeed be glorious ,
if in visiting a natural chasm ,
two quarrelsome neighbors would bridge the chasm
of their own discord .
well , i guess if job could accept his burdens .
uh , in america ,
it &apos;s pronounced &quot; job , &quot; flanders .
we can settle it when we &apos;re zipped up
together in a sleeping bag .
welcome aboard .
oh , oh , we &apos;d love to go ,
but is it such a good idea to travel with another family ?
it &apos;s fun . we travel with the hibberts all the time .
we ran into you once , in cincinnati .
and we had dinner .
we slid our tables together .
we were in a booth we could not get out of .
homie , we should go .
you and ned need to learn to get along .
you said the same thing about me and bart.
no . the judge said the same thing about you and bart.
judges . if they were any good they &apos;d be lawyers .
okay , we &apos;ll go .
but if flanders gets so annoying
that i can &apos;t take it anymore ,
the code word is octopus .
can it be something else ?
i don &apos;t like things with hidden beaks .
octopus or nothing .
okay .
so we took eight @-@ year @-@ old bart ,
and six @-@ year @-@ old lisa .
after ten hours of driving ,
i finally saw the most glorious site .
it &apos;s like disneyland for thin people .
did you know that the grand canyon was created by erosion ?
and before 1871 , it was called big canyon ?
okay , that &apos;s it .
we &apos;re on vacation .
why , you little ...
keep &apos; em coming , boy .
that one stung me .
that &apos;s enough .
we &apos;re here to enjoy ourselves .
if you just turn your head slightly ,
i think you &apos;ll be pleasantly surprised .
no time .
homer .
and they say we &apos;re running out of room for our garbage .
* go tell it on the mountain *
* over the hills and everywhere *
* go tell it on the mountain *
* that jesus christ is born *
* born , born , born , born *
* go tell it on the mountain *
octopus . octopus .
oct @-@ ar @-@ pus .
a vacation with flanders ?
that &apos;s like telling you a bedtime story without a beer .
now , where were we ?
thank you , ma &apos;am .
thank you .
am i such a terrible mother
that my son doesn &apos;t even know
to say thank you to a waitress ?
come on , honey . what do you say ?
you want me to lie and say i &apos;m thankful for chicken and veg
when i wanted whiskey- battered bourbon bangers ?
just say thank you .
my boy never said thank you .
now he &apos;s on death row .
was on death row .
daddy , when will the noise stop ?
hmm . take these .
ugh . those were earplugs .
i never thought there &apos;d be something
i &apos;d want to stare at longer than that car wreck on the way here .
we &apos;ve got to hurry before they run out of mules .
ooh . is that what they &apos;re serving for breakfast ?
how about donkeys ?
no .
that &apos;s odd .
enjoying your moon view , homer ?
why you little ...
two can play at that game .
stupid kid .
so embarrassing .
i &apos;m a little nervous
with all these waivers we have to sign .
marge , this is a national park .
people are completely safe here .
now let &apos;s do my favorite thing :
go downhill .
whoa . you &apos;re 180 ?
my blood pressure is .
okay . uh , let &apos;s get you a mule , dude .
get me el gordo .
gordo here used to carry 200 @-@ pound granite blocks
up from the canyon .
this has got to be the most beautiful thing
we &apos;ve ever stole from the indians .
what is that ?
a billionaires &apos; retreat .
yeah , the heads of america &apos;s most powerful media companies
have come to enjoy nature .
put up the cell phone tower .
i said i wanted a tom cruise type ,
not tom cruise .
burn down the cell phone tower .
i can &apos;t stand rich people .
can i name my mule ?
we prefer you don &apos;t .
is there a name for this trail ?
i &apos;m sure there is .
is this a fun job ?
not at the moment .
do you count as a grownup ?
my parents don &apos;t think so .
you &apos;re a grownup to me .
thanks .
here , have a piece of the canyon .
are you sure it &apos;s okay ?
hey , it only makes the canyon grander .
i don &apos;t know where your son gets it , marge .
i &apos;m only going to say this once ,
but i think you &apos;re a little checked out .
checked out . checked out .
checked out . checked out . checked out .
checked out . checked out .
checked out .
well , your kids aren &apos;t exactly perfect .
yay ! we can improve .
let &apos;s think about it quietly .
boy , i bet that mustache smells really bad , huh ?
oh , don &apos;t you rip on my lip strip .
i smell candles and @-@ and pew polish .
we &apos;re near a church .
catholic , if i don &apos;t miss my guess .

a little popish for my taste ,
but i did come here for adventure .
geez , flanders ,
you find god in everything .
god is in everything .
he &apos;s omnipresent .
you mean , if i check into the omni hotel right now ,
he &apos;s there ?
as a matter of fact , he is .
then , from now on , we &apos;re staying at the hyatt regency .
you &apos;re banned there , dad .
not as hagwar swanson .
哈格瓦 · 斯旺森 捷安特公司ceo
i love this country .
are you sure this is safe ?
totally . you &apos;re with state farm , right ?
where &apos;s our guide ?
where &apos;s the trail ?
big maggie .
i &apos;d like to hear the rest .
i still have my piece of the canyon .
okay . it was looking rough ...
oh , no bars .
you mean , on your phone ?
hey , you &apos;re right .
oh , more bad news .
oh , most of the food was on the guide &apos;s mule .
i sure am glad somebody
packed all this whitefish salad .
i &apos;m willing to eat some .
and if i die , you know it &apos;s bad .
homer , it &apos;s time for you and me to go out and get help .
please be careful , uncle ned .
i will , bart.
please , please be careful .
don &apos;t worry .
if you don &apos;t come back , i &apos;ll be so sad .
excuse me ? what about over here ?
right .
please , please be careful .
please .
let &apos;s go , flanders .
oh , no . the poor thing gets night terrors .
i forgot to say &quot; god bless the mailman . &quot;
he &apos;s not awake , but he &apos;s not asleep .
do your kids get these ?
i will now that i know what they are .
other kids say i &apos;m in their nightmares .
i &apos;m not your puppet , bart. i &apos;m not .
you ever seen stars this bright , homer ?
blessed is the beauty of our lord .
amen . listen , flanders .
this trip has given me time to think .
if i die here ,
you &apos;re welcome to live in my carcass for warmth .
i &apos;m not living in your carcass .
oh , come on . you make it sound like a bad thing .
look , we &apos;re saved !
we just go down there , get some food and help
returning to civilization .
attention , people talking .
unless you are here to dispose of our poop ,
we will start shooting in five minutes .
how is that even camping ?
it &apos;s easier for a camel
to pass through the eye of a needle
than a rich man to get into heaven .
sometimes i just don &apos;t get it .
what i &apos;m saying is , the eye of the needle
is very small , and a camel ...
no . i mean down there--
they have everything we need to survive ,
but they won &apos;t share .
maybe if i look through these binoculars one more time ,
i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll see something better .
we &apos;ve got to go in and steal what we need .
well , thou shalt not steal .
but if i don &apos;t steal , that &apos;s coveting .
that &apos;s bad , too .
look , flanders , we tried things your way ,
and it failed .
now let &apos;s try mine .
okay .
w @-@ wait !
we never did things my way .
too late . : i &apos;m already rolling downhill .
ow , sharp rock .
ooh , cactus !
more scorpions .
is that all you can do ? sting ?
now they &apos;re pinching .

easy , flanders , don &apos;t make a sound .
okay , here .
come on , take this .
oh , i got it .
oh , it &apos;s heavy .
ready to go .
uh , we &apos;re too heavy .
toss off what we don &apos;t need .
fine . we can do without salad forks .
no sugar tonight for the coffee .
no sugar tonight for their tea .
we took all their fancy cheeses
and their tasty charcuterie .
trout solo !
grand canyon ! yeah !
you know , homer , we make a good team .
homer ?
breakfast time .
come and get it !
come and get it !
come and ...
ugh . not again .
tablecloths .
caviar .
bacon !
bacon .
no , this was before lisa was a vegetarian .
that &apos;s right . i had the arteries of a 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
i &apos;m gonna miss you , pal .
well , homer ,
you think this will be one of those vacations
where the friendship we made will last forever
or start eroding the minute we enter our cars ?
flanders , like all friendships between men ,
in the end it &apos;s up to our wives .
that was a nice story , homer .
you know , sometimes i wish this grand canyon between us ,
uh , wasn &apos;t so large .
the offer still stands .
you can live in my carcass .
there &apos;s room in my legs for the boys .
maybe we could just store old clothes in you .
i &apos;d like that .
and you know what , flanders ?
i think we owe you guys a trip .
always wanted to visit the postcard museum .
thank you .
my pleasure .
i wonder if they sell postcards in the gift shop .
we don &apos;t .
