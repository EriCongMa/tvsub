sweetie , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s nothing .
when was the last time you drove to work in the dark ?
that &apos;s not my point . exactly .
he doesn &apos;t do this . he doesn &apos;t call us in at the pre @-@ crack .
who the hell keeps texting you every day ?
him , but this is different . he left a voice message .
it &apos;s gotta be life @-@ altering .
ok , that &apos;s dramatic .
yeah , well ,
given this year , i &apos;m allowed that .
it &apos;s gonna be ok .
that &apos;s where we met .
right there .
look , it &apos;s important to remember the good things about this place
i know .
because there &apos;s been a few .
go .
i love you .
i love you , too .
where &apos;s hotch ?
any minute .
i didn &apos;t get a file sent to me .
did a case go directly to him ?
don &apos;t know .
when &apos;s the last time he called a meeting this early ?
3 years , 8 months ago .
and what happened ?
gideon left .
who &apos;s leaving ?
nobody &apos;s leaving .
come on , get it down here !
his skull is fractured . if i can &apos;t get to him , he &apos;s gone .
help ...
we &apos;re gonna get you out of there , ok ?
you &apos;re gonna be all right .
please ...
we gotta get him out of here .
please , don &apos;t let me die .
we &apos;re gonna get you out . what &apos;s your name ?
kyle .
ok , kyle .
is there anyone you want me to call ?
where &apos;s your phone ?
hang in there , kyle .
hang in there .
i appreciate everyone coming in early .
what &apos;s going on ?
the director called a meeting last night to discuss budgets .
they skipped over strauss ?
she &apos;s away .
the bureau is facing a lot of changes
and this unit is no exception .
over the next few weeks , each of you is going to be asked
if you &apos;d like to stay with the unit .
why wouldn &apos;t we ?
there are other options for you out there .
and while i want the unit to stay together ,
i understand completely
if you want to see what the alternatives are .
morgan , there &apos;s renewed interest in you from the new york office .
nobody &apos;s called me .
they will .
that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m gonna go .
oh , i know .
are you staying here ?
it &apos;s my intention .
all i ask is if you are contacted by another division
that you let me know .
hotchner .
yes .
right . we can be there in 20 minutes .
virginia state police believe they &apos;ve uncovered a serial killer .
they need us at zacha road and route 7 as soon as possible .
morgan , you and dave get out there .
what about this ?
we can talk about it later .
they get anything from the driver before he died ?
severe head trauma . he stopped making sense .
state p.d. said they couldn &apos;t find any i.d. anywhere .
ran his prints--nothing .
well , the guy &apos;s gotta have a record .
they &apos;re both young and healthy .
hey , rossi , look at what he did to them .
this can &apos;t be his first time .
just because he &apos;s bad doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s been busted .
what about the vin and plates ?
running them now .
both victims seem to have on some type of uniform .
shorts and tanks .
are we dealing with a cult ?
that usually ends in suicide , not torture .
i mean , he was beaten and strangled .
she was--oh . completely different injuries .
it looks like more than one offender .
they can &apos;t be more than 20 years old .
somebody &apos;s gotta be missing them .
here &apos;s the thing .
i can &apos;t get prints
unless they &apos;re on the missing persons list .
which they are . jake wattey has been missing since december
and paige hawley since february .
local kids ?
no . not even remotely .
jake is from arizona , paige is from ohio .
was he a junior at arizona state ?
yeah . how did--wait .
we consulted on this case during christmas .
yeah , he was academically burned out .
we thought it might be a suicide .
his body was never found .
until now .
so how did he end up 2,000 miles away ?
he had been missing for months . why kill him now ?
thomas hardy wrote ,
&quot; and yet to every bad there is a worse . &quot;
hey , morgan .
check this out .
unsub depot .
he kills them ,
throws them in the trunk .
but why not use this
wherever he &apos;s done the deed ?
it &apos;s loud and time @-@ consuming .
it &apos;d leave a messy trail .
forensic countermeasure .
doesn &apos;t want to lead us to where he kills them .
maybe he was gonna bury them in the woods
or dump them in the river .
it &apos;s pretty damn secluded out here .
we need to figure out what happened
before they got in the car .
when was the last time it rained out here ?
do i look like a weatherman ?
come here .
there &apos;s mud caked all over the tires .
that may be
what was in the victims &apos; hair .
they could have been dragged through it .
let &apos;s find out where it was raining in the last 24 hours .
the only reason we have this case is because of an accident .
you know the odds of that ?
is that rhetorical ?
combined with the chance
that this is his first time dumping bodies .
you think he &apos;s working alone ?
what do you think ?
unlikely . it &apos;s high @-@ risk to move one body out of state ,
but 2 ?
paige was abducted months after having jake in captivity ,
and he traveled with both ,
which means he &apos;s criminally sophisticated .
it seems more like an organized operation
as opposed to an individual offender .
then he &apos;s probably done this before .
you think there are more victims out there .
impossible to say until we figure out
how those two were targeted .
come in .
hello . this is the information i have
on the casualties from today .
i &apos;m running open cases from last year now .
is there anything else you &apos;d like me to do ?
no , that &apos;s all . thank you .
ok .
um , sir , i &apos;m worried that everything isn &apos;t ok ,
and if there &apos;s anything you want to talk to--
garcia , well talk about it later .
oh . ok .
garcia , you need to widen this search . go back 2 years .
really ? that &apos;s a lot of people .
is there any parameters to narrow that down ?
no , not yet . unfortunately ,
transporting victims across state lines
is not an issue for this group .
group ?
how do you know it &apos;s a group ?
we &apos;ve got different genders from different parts of the country .
this is not a traditional unsub .
come in .
hey , andi . uh , garcia ,
this is ssa andi swan .
she &apos;s the head of the domestic trafficking task force .
andi , this is--
penelope garcia .
i went to your online trafficking seminar last fall .
you terrify me .
sorry . i do remember you .
uh @-@ uh . really ?
you asked great questions .
i thought you nicked my power point .
i didn &apos;t , but i could .
so i &apos;ve heard .
i will get you that list .
let me know if you need anything else .
very nice to see you again .
you , too .
she &apos;s not easy to forget .
no . so how are you ?
tired .
human trafficking is a growth industry
and i &apos;ve got half the agents i had last year .
how can we help ?
i get notifications on body discoveries
of 18- to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds .
paige hawley and jake wattey .
i got a theory on what happened . can i fill you in ?
sure . we got case boards set up in the conference room .
yeah . any chance we &apos; be passing a coffee pot ?
do you know who did this ?
i &apos;ve been 2 steps behind an organization
that abducts college kids throughout the u.s.
how long have you been tracking them ?
3 years . but this is the first time
there &apos;s been an identifiable body .
do you think this is their work ?
it &apos;s definitely their type .
stressed @-@ out , vulnerable kids .
they &apos;re all from good families ,
making them low @-@ risk for abduction .
young innocents are worth more money .
and they &apos;re harder to lure , so they hold on to them
for a longer period of time .
how many victims are they holding at once ?
that &apos;s hard to say .
but from what i can tell , there &apos;s a lot of turnover .
customers don &apos;t want to see the same faces twice .
we don &apos;t think they travel
with more than a handful of victims at one time .
they hunt all over the country .
all they need is a car .
they might be low @-@ tech , but they &apos;re organized .
and profitable .
the rumor is that they hold events for 2 days
in metropolitan areas and then they disappear .
what kind of events ?
where top @-@ paying customers can do things like this
and worse to the victims .
it seems impossible to trace .
we study their behavior .
they &apos;re not a good breed , but they &apos;re still human .
they make a few mistakes .
we &apos;ve also recently established an undercover unit .
wait , how can you infiltrate them ?
wouldn &apos;t your agents have
to commit a crime to be accepted as a customer ?
exactly . that &apos;s why we can &apos;t pose as buyers .
the entire system is set up to protect the customers ,
but there &apos;s no way we can trace them from that end .
your agents go in as targets .
do you have anybody under now ?
locally a few .
they &apos;re still establishing the backstories .
they might be able to help .
i &apos;ll call .
what did you do with lucy ?
what did you do with her ?
where is she ?
kyle should be back . he missed the last 2 calls .
he likes that part .
takes his time with it .
it never takes him this long .
did he set up the scanners ?
not here .
please ...
what are you doing ?
tank &apos;s 3 / 4 full .
well , it says here capacity &apos;s 18 gallons .
15 miles per gallon .
so he used 1 / 4 tank . he must have fueled up about 70 miles ago .
ok , reid .
what &apos;s the mileage ?
33,823 .
on a 2011 ? what the hell &apos;s he been doing ?
crossing state lines . looks like he enjoys the long way .
avoids interstates . no gps .
no cell phone .
low @-@ tech . nothing traceable .
but if he &apos;s working with a group
and he has no phone , how &apos;s he checking in ?
yeah .
roanoke .
what ?
big storm .
you run the registration ?
of course i did . and it &apos;s bogus .
led to a guy who &apos;s been dead 3 years .
do you really think these ratfinks that are dumping bodies
in the middle of nowhere would leave a paper trail ?
hey , you ok ?
no . clearly i am not .
ok , so talk to me .
i am sick of the sickos .
and ?
there has got to be more to life
than being surrounded by this .
ok , whoa , whoa , slow down .
since when is penelope garcia gonna throw in the towel ?
since exactly now .
baby girl , listen to me . i know you &apos;re upset .
so am i. but what you &apos;re trying to do right now
is distance yourself from any more loss ,
and i get it . i do the same thing .
i am not some unsub that you can try to relate to
and then break down .
you have every right to be angry ,
but there &apos;s really nothing you can do .
no , derek , you do not understand me .
i don &apos;t like change . i have major control issues .
no , say it ain &apos;t so .
not you .
i just made you smile , didn &apos;t i ?
maybe .
good .
i hate you .
this group needs space and solitude ,
especially if they &apos;re holding multiple victims .
these two lived thousands of miles apart
but were somehow both targeted .
they send scouts to campuses , malls , clubs .
yeah , they go with a shopping list ,
but rarely do they take more than one victim from a city .
the victims are assets . why would the unsubs kill their profit ?
maybe the victims are escaping ,
or their clients are adapting .
adapting ?
these clients are extremely depraved .
when the act of sex isn &apos;t enough for them anymore ,
they may be demanding more extreme forms of release .
which was my fear .
and these two just proved it .
swan .
change of plans .
we &apos;re starting early .
what is it ?
one of my u.c.s missed her last two check @-@ ins .
no , no ...
when exactly did you talk to her ?
that &apos;s 34 hours ago and that &apos;s unacceptable .
this is why we have check @-@ ins .
we &apos;re on our way to her place right now .
don &apos;t . trust me , it &apos;s better that you &apos;re not in front of me .
andi , you don &apos;t know for sure that she was taken .
my job is to expect the worst right now ,
and that means she was .
and she &apos;s in there with no wire , no weapon , and no backup .
what &apos;s her name ?
renee .
matlin .
she &apos;s only 25 .
she probably asked the wrong person the right question .
there was no way of knowing she &apos;d do that .
we had no indication from intel
that this group was even in the area .
she had to be following her own lead .
well , her initiative is why you hired her .
probably reminded you of someone .
yeah . which is why i should have seen the downfalls .
trying to be a hero . it doesn &apos;t always work out .
when were they killed ?
best guess is 8 hours ago .
skin abrasions say he got a
bare @-@ knuckle beating before he was strangled .
what about her ?
shallow cuts look like torture ,
but the fatal one was quick .
severed carotid .
they had bruising around both of their necks ,
their arms , and legs .
so they were dragged around .
no sign of other restraints .
rossi .
this unsub &apos;s hands must be huge .
they &apos;ve got mud and dirt on them ,
but no signs of being held for months .
i gotta tell you , they don &apos;t look like typical missings .
i usually see malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies ,
but not here .
they were taken care of .
preliminary blood results
confirm he &apos;s got high levels of sildenafil citrate .
commonly used for erectile dysfunction .
not surprising . probably uppers and downers , too .
yes . and she has mifepristone
and misoprostol in her system .
what &apos;s that ?
she just had a medical abortion .
can i ask what &apos;s going on here ?
we think they may be victims of a trafficking ring .
evidence points there , except ...
what ?
why would they take such good care of them
and then turn around and kill them ?
here are the missing coeds since 2009 .
ok , uh , we still need to narrow this down .
let &apos;s look at last @-@ known locations . maybe there &apos;s an overlap .
they &apos;re from all over the place .
these guys hunt in target @-@ rich environments .
right . clubs , malls , that kind of thing .
what are morgan and rossi finding ?
uh , a lot of mud on the car and the victims .
mud ? did it rain here ?
no , not here . south .
morgan has a theory that based on the gas mileage ,
they must have filled up within 70 miles of the accident .
gotcha . how many gas stations you find ?
42 .
how &apos;d you narrow that down ?
i didn &apos;t . why not ?
i didn &apos;t have any more parameters .
never stopped you before .
i &apos;ll be right back .
thanks , reid .
what was renee &apos;s cover ?
uh , junior at george mason university .
worked the student union .
just simple 9 to 5 . she needs her nights and weekends
to go out and find these guys .
how many u.c.s do you have ?
we got dozens all over the country .
you recruited them all yourself ?
yeah .
hey , she was onto something .
her internet history &apos;s been cleared .
it &apos;s just a habit of hers .
what was the last thing she said to her handler ?
uh , &quot; home . safe . all good . &quot; that &apos;s it .
so something must have happened yesterday morning .
is she a runner ?
avid .
you see any running shoes anywhere ?
no .
hi , sweetheart .
dad and i are thinking about getting to florida
the weekend before johnny &apos;s wedding .
i know it &apos;s a long shot , but we were hoping you could join .
you &apos;ve been working so hard , and it &apos;s only a week .
talk to your boss .
but only if you want .
this isn &apos;t a pressure call , it &apos;s just , well , we miss you .
they get to see you all the time , and we ...
your brother &apos;s treatments will be over ,
and so it &apos;d be a reunion .
just us . like old times .
what do you think ?
call me back .
love you .
she &apos;s marked an article about upcoming marathons in d.c.
maybe she was in training .
she &apos;s too cautious . she wouldn &apos;t run alone ,
and she &apos;d never run at night .
if she went , she went in the morning .
what are her brother &apos;s treatments for ?
hodgkin &apos;s .
she might be running for the cause .
we could find out if she
showed up for a group run yesterday morning .
all that from a pair of missing sneakers .
garcia , find out everything you can
about marathon training groups in manassas .
yes , sir .
and focus on any groups that fund @-@ raise for cancer .
thanks . bye .
reid says we have a missing undercover ?
yeah . andi swan &apos;s agent .
her name &apos;s renee matlin . she &apos;s 25 .
she &apos;s been undercover for about a year .
entry level . she couldn &apos;t have got that far into the world .
yeah , then how &apos;d she get taken ?
well , knowing swan , she hired somebody just like her . driven .
you know her , too ?
we consulted a long time ago .
you got any leads on the gas stations ?
7 .
damn .
but , the kind that sells this egg and cheese sandwich
and cramer &apos;s coffee-- there &apos;s only one .
yes , there is .
you good ?
better now .
thanks for visiting .
most people pay cash nowadays .
i had to start charging more for credit cards .
well , in these hard times , people pay what , 30 @-@ 40 bucks ?
that &apos;s about right , yeah .
yeah , well , this guy would have filled up his tank ,
probably spent 80 .
your partner just did that .
what are you looking at ?
i got a monitor down here .
they got cameras .
there .
back it up .
he already paid .
where &apos;s he going ?
what &apos;s around this corner ?
bathrooms .
they &apos;ve been out of order for a couple days , though .
my boss won &apos;t give me any money to fix them .
it &apos;s a pay phone .
hello .
hey , i need you , baby girl .
i need to be needed .
can you pull outgoing calls from a pay phone ?
is that hypothetical ? give me the digits .
let me see . it &apos;s , uh ,
703 @-@ 555 @-@ 0123 .
ok . outgoing call at 6 : 04 a.m.
to a local number ,
which is a pay phone .
is it close by ?
pharmacy &apos;s 3 miles away .
well , these guys cover their tracks .
they don &apos;t even use disposable cells .
sorry i couldn &apos;t be more help .
no , actually , you did .
local calls tell me that they &apos;re not in the middle
of their journey .
those kids were killed somewhere close to here .
thanks , mama .
renee &apos;s group confirms that she was there yesterday ,
but she ran with a friend . she was late .
a woman ?
another brunette .
they may have taken her , too .
please !
somebody !
renee , be quiet .
they &apos;re gonna hear you .
lucy , can you see any of them ?
no , i don &apos;t . do you ?
no .
where did you get that ?
i found it . go on .
i can &apos;t find a way out .
yeah , i &apos;m trying .
i--i think they &apos;re down the hall .
there are 6 of them and 7 of us .
well , maybe we can take them .
no .
no . that &apos;s why they &apos;re sedating us .
what do you think &apos;s gonna happen ?
they &apos;re gonna sell us .
wait .
please , don &apos;t take her .
don &apos;t take her .
don &apos;t take her .
renee &apos;s done a lot of homework .
these people have all been to clubs over the weekend
and vanished within 3 days ,
including this morning &apos;s victims .
so why didn &apos;t she share her theory ?
she &apos;s a perfectionist .
i &apos;m sure she wanted to gather enough intel to prove it .
using the club as a template , there are potentially
63 others who were taken by the same offenders .
there &apos;s no way to know which ones are still alive .
andi swan .
how you been ?
better .
thanks for helping out .
nice to see you again , andi .
what &apos;d you find ?
we tracked the driver to a gas station outside culpepper .
he used a pay phone to
call another one in the same town .
so they &apos;re close .
and careful .
what &apos;s their budget on location ?
not much . they pay cash , no questions asked .
security &apos;s top priority .
so this guy &apos;s found a place
to hold , what , a dozen victims ?
so we &apos;re looking for a secluded spot
in rural virginia .
well , that shouldn &apos;t be hard to find .
welcome back , everyone .
i thought traffickers concentrated in port cities .
international ones do .
unfortunately , domestic
traffickers abduct from all over the country .
it doesn &apos;t seem like they stay
in one location long after an abduction .
they move quickly and efficiently .
my guess was in a nondescript car ,
and until this morning
that was just a theory .
they &apos;ve lost their driver now , so they &apos;re in jeopardy .
it &apos;s all about survival for them .
they &apos;ll move out tonight .
but they &apos;ve got customers and victims lined up .
they don &apos;t want to lose the money .
and their location hasn &apos;t been compromised yet .
who knows where they &apos;re gonna end up ?
based on reid &apos;s theory , we need to see
if renee had been to any clubs before she disappeared .
she went to the local clubs .
she &apos;d report back if anyone suspicious approached her .
we followed the leads , nothing panned out .
what was the last club ?
scotty &apos;s in georgetown .
if they find out she &apos;s an agent , she &apos;s dead .
pretty impressive . he &apos;s still standing .
this team &apos;s got to be
very well @-@ coordinated to be pulling this off .
they &apos;re cohesive and loyal .
the promise of money motivates them to be efficient .
and so does fear .
what are your thoughts about who the leader might be ?
she won &apos;t shut up .
she &apos;s got the others wound up .
well , give her something .
how much ?
you want her to walk , right ?
stay here .
we need to look at this from the leader &apos;s point of view .
a group like this requires a strong leader .
yeah , this guy &apos;s in charge of some unstable personalities .
do you have any theories ?
i have always thought he led through fear .
this guy can blackmail his whole team .
look at the progression of this network .
they started abducting
victims for sex and then adapted to killing .
because he saw the growth potential in his assets .
instead of just disposing of them ,
he made it into a show .
and that &apos;s why the victims are so young .
the customers will pay top dollar
to see them tortured .
the average guy doesn &apos;t have that
kind of money laying around .
so they &apos;re successful .
and incredibly deviant .
that &apos;s their big secret .
if it was revealed , they &apos;d be ruined .
wouldn &apos;t they have to criminally
prove themselves to join the club ?
if they &apos;re upstanding citizens , how do they do that ?
it could be a white @-@ collar crime , like money laundering .
that &apos;s often done through real estate .
garcia ,
who owned the clubs where the victims went missing ?
bruce harmon owns the club in arizona .
and in ohio ?
bob moore .
and scotty &apos;s in georgetown ?
bob moore is a partner in that .
do any of them own property in virginia ?
moore also is a partner
in the development of a private facility .
what happened to it ?
it looks like bad guys go through hardship , too .
financiers pulled all the money out in 2009,
so it &apos;s not anything .
what was it ?
it was supposed to be a tough @-@ love rehab center ,
but now--
now it &apos;s just an abandoned factory
in the middle of nowhere .
with a lot of acreage and mud .
how close to the gas station ?
8 miles west of it .
let &apos;s go .
i &apos;m gonna get you out of here .
hey , how did you get out ?
i think there &apos;s a door down there .
no , they keep that door guarded at all times .
we gotta use the other one .
what about outside ?
no , it &apos;s not a big operation .
they &apos;ve got maybe one guard for the whole property .
if we wait for him to pass , we just run like hell .
wait , how do you know ?
i watched their patterns .
and when they drove us in , i only saw one guard .
what are you ?
you &apos;re some kind of cop .
so you--they know that you &apos;re here .
they might come and get us .
no .
nobody knows .
don &apos;t you have a wire ?
no , i have nothing .
we &apos;ve got a special guest tonight .
minimum bid just doubled .
how &apos;s it gonna go ?
get the money .
this one is mine .
you &apos;re sick .
what did you say ?
how messed up do you have to be ...
to sit in a cell and pretend you &apos;ve got a friend ?
they &apos;re gonna find you .
well , you won &apos;t be here to see it .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
you &apos;re gonna lose .
look at how brave .
you get off on it , don &apos;t you ?
betraying people .
what , it &apos;s a power trip ?
you have all the control .
how did you know ?
but , you know , this isn &apos;t about me
or you , really .
this is about money .
they &apos;re gonna find all of you , and when they--
boss !
what ?
take care of it .
we gotta go .
what about her ?
just give me a excuse to blow your brains out !
let me see your hands !
against the wall .
clear !
she &apos;s alive .
we need a medic downstairs .
how &apos;s she doing ?
she &apos;s still out , but her vitals are good .
she &apos;s gonna make it .
this is the last one .
how many arrests ?
18 .
and 7 victims rescued .
hey ! hey , stop that vehicle !
stop ! where you going ? !
stop !
they were gonna take me away .
we need to get you some help .
i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m fine .
we know what happened here .
no , you don &apos;t .
you &apos;re right . i can &apos;t imagine .
i just don &apos;t want to get strapped down again .
strapped down ?
he &apos;s a lot younger than i expected .
this guy &apos;s our leader ?
and how long have you been gone ?
they got me when i was 17 .
he was the only one who got out .
right .
but ...
they go after older ones now .
and she &apos;s the only victim he took with him .
why don &apos;t i give you a ride .
you don &apos;t have to come with me .
no , it &apos;s ok .
renee was last seen with a brunette .
it &apos;s her .
dave !
you ever think of packing it all in ?
yeah . sometimes .
we should live on a farm .
what ?
land , fresh air ,
chickens .
seclusion .
yes .
yeah , that &apos;s all a bad guy needs to torture you .
ok , stop .
well , it &apos;s true .
but what if you didn &apos;t see that anymore ?
what if all you saw were acres and acres
of--of green and , oh , a windmill
and solar panels ?
