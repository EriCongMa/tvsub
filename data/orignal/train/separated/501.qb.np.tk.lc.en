the forever people
you need to talk .
i know exactly how to get what i want .
no , stop ! stop !
stop . stop .
what was that , huh ?
you lost your form , completely let your guard down .
what was that ?
what ?
you know , if you &apos;re fighting somebody who knows what they &apos;re doing
and you pulled that garbage , they &apos;d kill you .
so why didn &apos;t you ?
yeah . i think we &apos;re done here .
有案子
if i were you ...
stop !
i would save my strength .
where are we flying to this time , mama ?
boulder city , nevada , my vision ,
home of the hoover dam ,
because police there found the body of a woman ,
wrapped and weighed down in the water .
he apparently likes to freeze .
i.d. yet ?
no , unfortunately .
how long was she in the water ?
unclear . her popsicleness made it hard to determine an m.o.
are we sure this is the unsub and not just exposure ?
her blood was frozen in her veins .
temperatures in the area don &apos;t get cold enough for that .
hoover dam is not that far from vegas .
could this be a hitman ?
no marks on her , though .
hitmen usually leave evidence of an efficient kill .
no , he did leave a mark .
where ?
breastbone , above the heart .
it &apos;s not frostbite . that &apos;s an electrical burn .
why introduce electroshock to the m.o. ?
believe it or not , hypothermia is a rather pleasant way to die .
the cold just kind of puts you to sleep .
he wants to prolong what he &apos;s doing ,
so he jolts her back awake .
how did you catch all that ?
i &apos;ve seen it before .
put this on .
are you aware of what you signed ?
yes .
are you prepared to advance to level 2 ?
yes .
this is your baptism .
there &apos;s no turning back .
good luck .
&quot; every man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not ,
and oftentimes we call a man cold when he is only sad . &quot;
henry wadsworth longfellow .
still no i.d. of the victim ?
garcia &apos;s running her markers through vicap .
this unsub went through a lot of trouble
wrapping and weighing the body down .
usually it &apos;s postmortem gas production
that brings a body to the surface ,
but if you freeze it , it &apos;ll rise to the top
like ice cubes in a drink .
so he &apos;s smart enough to consider the possibility ,
but not experienced enough to effectively execute the disposal .
it &apos;s probably his first kill .
if he went through this much trouble to hide the body ,
he knows it can be tied back to him .
should be easy to find him once we learn who she is .
that &apos;ll be our first objective when we land .
we should also build a suspect pool based on boat ownership .
how many boats are there on lake mead ?
1,908 .
come on . you just know that ?
yeah . there are 1,908 boats on lake mead .
where did you get that number ?
based on the population density of the area ,
i ... estimated .
you guessed .
i mean , is this guy really a genius ,
or does he just say things with authority and we all believe him ?
oh , wow . thank you . 10 years .
it took 10 years for someone to finally have my back .
all right , einstein , she just called you out . bring it .
look it up .
i am ...
and the kid &apos;s right .
i accept your apology .
load up .
never .
we &apos;re dragging the lake for additional victims .
problem is , it &apos;s a huge body of water .
start from the disposal site and radiate out from there .
that &apos;s how green river operated .
did you take a dental imprint ?
yeah , we &apos;re running it against our records ,
and we sent it to your technical analyst .
damn it . what ?
we might be in the wrong police station .
all this talk about the cold is making me cold .
is that weird ?
nothing weird about you , baby girl . listen ,
you get anything off vicap ?
negatory . and no one reported this poor girl missing , either .
all right , run her stats against arizona dmv .
ooh , a new state .
give me a second to run her dental records .
why search one state over ?
the arizona @-@ nevada line runs right through lake mead .
pretty good forensic countermeasure .
he knows that our search stops at the state line .
got her . sarah rhodes of kingman , arizona .
and--oh , goodness , a mother to 10 @-@ year @-@ old bobby .
credit cards and cell phone canceled 3 years ago .
arizona . we &apos;re in the wrong state .
i do have one breadcrumb .
she made regular visits to several atms
in your boulder city neck of the woods .
i have the security camera footage to prove it .
last withdrawal was two weeks ago ,
always the same amount , $ 260 a month .
what the hell was she doing here ?
cloth fibers under her fingernails match her own torn clothing .
paradoxical undressing .
when your core temperature reaches 85 degrees ,
your constricted blood vessels suddenly dilate ,
producing the sensation of extreme heat .
you tear your clothing off
even though you &apos;re freezing to death .
what if what the unsub is doing
is like the cold water experiments at dachau ?
the nazis wanted to see how long concentration
camp victims could survive in the cold
and then apply those findings to their own soldiers .
how is this the same ?
it &apos;s a test . he wants to see how long you can take it .
all right , there &apos;s the electrical burns .
the ice has melted enough to show us the matching mark .
left anterior axillary line . is this--
yeah .
clear .
it looks like multiple resuscitations .
scar tissue says this was done over weeks ,
but there &apos;s no signs of restraints or binds .
she went into that freezer voluntarily .
why would she want this ?
hotch needs us .
ok . i &apos;m right behind you .
i &apos;m just gonna wait for the final m.e. report .
if i were you ...
i would save my strength .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry , is this right ,
this blood glucose level ? that &apos;s accurate ?
i know what this is about .
did i make it ?
yes .
you &apos;re one of us now .
come .
come .
walk up .
thank you for agreeing to talk to us about sarah .
sure . we were good friends through our kids
for a while .
right now there &apos;s an amber alert out on bobby ,
and we &apos;re attempting to find the father .
let me ask you this-- do you think there &apos;s any--
he &apos;s not in the picture .
never has been .
she never even told me his name .
do why &apos;d she leave this condo and move to nevada
without selling it ?
i wish i knew .
one day she told me she was gonna join a mom group
just to get some support . then , bam , she was gone .
i could barely get her on the phone .
when i did , she acted like it was a privilege to talk to her .
did she talk about the new life path she &apos;d found
and that she couldn &apos;t really explain
it to you because you weren &apos;t worthy ?
how did you know ?
the autopsy revealed something very specific .
whoever had sarah flooded her system with sugar and electrolytes ,
but they starved her of proteins .
when you don &apos;t have protein in your diet ,
you can &apos;t think straight .
it &apos;s a common tool used in psychological conditioning .
psychological ...
brainwashing .
she didn &apos;t join a mom group , did she ?
no .
she joined a cult .
based on the physical evidence
and the psychological profile of sarah rhodes ,
we believe that a cult operating in the area
is responsible for killing her .
there aren &apos;t any cults around here .
most people think that , but conservative estimates
put cult membership at two million people in the united states .
most of them , like this one , are underground to avoid scrutiny .
the nature of cults is that
they are organized around a charismatic psychopath .
this many will be superficially intelligent and charming .
like jim jones at jonestown
and tony alamo and alamo ministries
or charles dederich in synanon ,
this man will have convinced his followers
to sublimate their needs for his own ...
to the point of self @-@ harm or even suicide .
he preys upon disenfranchised men and women
who need help in their daily lives .
sarah rhodes needed help being a single mom .
as of now , we believe her son bobby is still inside the group .
the way cults work is they break you down
both physically and mentally ,
usually through isolation and deprivation .
we believe that this cult has found a way to speed that up
through a near @-@ death experience .
they lock their members in a giant freezer to induce hypothermia ,
then they resuscitate them .
why hypothermia ?
the last stage of cold @-@ induced shock is euphoria ,
an almost dreamy elation before you fall asleep .
when members regain consciousness ,
they feel like they &apos;ve been born again .
the reality is , they almost died .
focus your search on hospital records
for patients who suffered from frostbite .
we believe that sarah rhodes isn &apos;t the first victim
that this group has harmed .
thank you .
fear .
that &apos;s what kills us .
not our addictions .
not the toxins in our food .
those only paralyze us .
fear is what consumes us .
it &apos;s why we go into the dark , cold place .
we face our fear .
i can see your fear now .
i know who &apos;s worthy to move on to the next level and who isn &apos;t ,
and you are not worthy , adam lewis .
i don &apos;t want to do this anymore .
i &apos;m tired .
i &apos;m hungry . i just-- i want to go home .
ok , please ,
please , just let me go home !
i want to go home .
ok . hi , what &apos;s up ?
uh , garcia found a frostbite victim ,
admitted to the hospital 3 years ago ,
by the name of tom fallon .
completely off the grid , just like sarah ,
but his mother mary still lives in town .
great . let &apos;s go .
kate and morgan already went when we couldn &apos;t find you .
which is why i &apos;ve been waiting here
for 24 minutes and 18 seconds ,
so that maybe we can finally talk about what &apos;s wrong .
nothing &apos;s wrong .
i &apos;m fine .
you &apos;re not fine .
you &apos;re obviously displaying symptoms of post @-@ traumatic stress disorder ,
which absolutely makes sense .
we &apos;re coming up on a year since your abduction and torture ,
and anniversary dates have a power all their own .
not to mention the fact that seasonal
weather changes bring back smells
that you probably now can only associate with the initial event .
all that i &apos;m saying is that what you &apos;re going through
is entirely textbook .
in here .
stop it . stop it . stop doing that .
stop ... being you .
i can &apos;t help it .
yes , you can .
you can .
you think you know what &apos;s going on , but you don &apos;t .
well , then explain it to me , jj ,
because all i know is my friend is hurting ,
and when i see her in pain , i want to make it stop .
all right . all right .
give me a word .
a word ?
a term .
a label .
something that explains what i have ,
because it is bigger than ptsd ,
and right now that word is tivon .
tivon askari .
the man who tortured you .
no . no , he was more than that .
he was my partner in afghanistan .
i didn &apos;t--i didn &apos;t know he was a--
double agent . i know . i read the file .
you were attempting to extract intel from a woman named nadia .
he set a trap and killed nadia and her daughter .
listen , jj , you cannot blame yourself for that .
the humvee , was that in the file ?
yeah . you almost caught him .
he set an ied to take out your convoy .
i know you were wounded--
i was pregnant .
you see , if i had never gotten involved ,
nadia and her daughter would still be alive ,
and henry would have a little ...
i can &apos;t let this go . i can &apos;t .
what is the word for that , spence ?
i don &apos;t know .
this stays between us . ok ?
ok .
where are we on finding the boat ?
the presumption is that the , um ...
cult would have owned the boat .
so i &apos;m just gonna look at it from that angle .
is there something i should know ?
no . about ... no .
i &apos;ll let you know if i find anything .
yes ?
mrs. fallon , we &apos;re with the fbi .
we &apos;d like to ask you a few questions about your son .
the lawyer said i can &apos;t talk to you .
what lawyer ?
law firm of kane and associates .
they represent those weirdoes .
don &apos;t know their names or anything . tom wouldn &apos;t tell me .
and this is your son &apos;s signature ?
the releases saying he knew he was engaging in risky behavior ,
and if i defamed their character , they &apos;d take my house .
ma &apos;am , where &apos;s your son right now ?
mother ?
who was at the door ?
you need to understand .
after the hospital ,
those people didn &apos;t want him anymore .
i &apos;ve had to keep him here because ...
he &apos;s not right .
tom ?
yes ?
do you mind if we ask you a few questions ?
do you feel it ?
do you feel it all ?
feel what ?
you don &apos;t feel it .
your consciousness is too small to comprehend it .
i feel the emptiness of messages bombarding me ,
telling me to consume .
i feel like there &apos;s something lacking in my life ,
and i feel like you might have the answer .
i do .
yes , i do .
can you tell us where we can find your friends ,
so that we can find the answer , too ?
no .
but it &apos;s ok .
they will come back to me when it &apos;s time .
it won &apos;t be long now .
surely you must feel it ,
the walls of civilization crumbling around you .
the forever people will survive .
how will they survive ?
we &apos;ll freeze ourselves .
have you been there , in the cold ?
if you haven &apos;t , i can help you .
i can help you the way they helped me .
tommy , please don &apos;t .
they helped me feel it all .
please , let me out .
let me out .
i &apos;ll be ... i &apos;ll be good .
i &apos;ll do whatever ... whatever you want .
wait ... no .
please , i can be good .
ok , so garcia couldn &apos;t find anything online
about the forever people or cults that freeze in general ,
but she found this guy , adam lewis .
his parents reported him missing a month ago .
if cryogenics is their hook ,
they should try a lot harder to hide it .
technically , it &apos;s cryonics and not cryogenics .
cryogenics is a scientifically proven process involving
the successful freezing and thawing of materials without damage .
cryonics involves taking an already dead body
and putting it in liquid nitrogen ,
and there &apos;s no scientific merit whatsoever .
hiya . i thought you guys were getting cold feet .
oh , pun unintended .
garcia , tell us if anyone ordered the following supplies .
besides liquid nitrogen , they need large stainless steel dewars
for body storage .
that is a big n @-@ o on all fronts .
what about financial overlap ?
we know that sarah rhodes made monthly withdrawals .
did adam lewis do something similar ?
uh ... yes .
actually , he did .
the exact same amount of money--
260 bucks , to be exact .
and he wrote checks .
hello , paper trail .
the money went to the global warming awareness fund .
that &apos;s kind of the opposite end of the spectrum , isn &apos;t it ?
it makes sense . cults frequently set up nonprofits
to hide their earnings from members .
and you can &apos;t apply for nonprofit status without an address .
garcia .
i &apos;m way ahead of you , boss .
here it is . address sent .
as many of you know , the elite have been in consultation ,
and we are pleased to announce we have made our decision .
some of you will advance to level 3 .
and some of you won &apos;t .
keep in mind this does not mean the door
to rebirth and renewal is closed to you .
what it means is--
fbi .
protocol number 7 .
do not make eye contact .
colton grant , head of the global warming awareness front ?
i am .
we &apos;d like to talk to you .
personally .
of course you would .
have a seat .
what happened to your hand ?
what happened to your hand ?
your turn .
now , why would you wear a cast if you didn &apos;t have to ?
that &apos;s , uh ...
that &apos;s nothing . i ...
i &apos;ve seen the other half of this . you &apos;re bobby &apos;s father .
wait .
you &apos;re coming with me . come on .
wait , they will kill him
if you expose me , you understand ?
these people will kill my son .
you &apos;re not here because you &apos;re a believer , are you ?
gentlemen , my client is here on his own volition .
if you denigrate his beliefs in any way ,
we &apos;re leaving .
you own a boat , mr. grant ?
the fund owns one .
they run water temperature tests
to measure the greenhouse effects .
but you didn &apos;t bring me in here
to talk about a boat , now , did you ?
sarah rhodes and adam lewis .
what about them ?
seen them recently ?
they both requested to leave the forever people .
we don &apos;t believe in keeping anyone bound
that doesn &apos;t want to be bound ,
so , we wish them well .
then why did we just pull their frozen bodies out of lake mead ?
we &apos;re done here . colton , don &apos;t say another word .
this is your last chance to tell the truth .
where is sarah &apos;s son ?
i believe , to avoid self @-@ incrimination ,
i have the right to remain silent .
colton grant , you are under arrest for the murders
of sarah rhodes and adam lewis .
you do indeed have the right to remain silent .
and you also have the right ...
give a message to my flock .
anything you say can and will
this is a test .
be used against you
we will get through this together ,
in a court of law .
and not to lose faith .
i wasn &apos;t-- i wasn &apos;t ready to be a dad .
i hadn &apos;t heard from sarah in 5 years ,
and that &apos;s the way we both wanted it .
then , like a month ago , she called me from a pay phone .
she told me about this place
and that they wouldn &apos;t let her go .
and , uh ...
i told her that i would join
and , uh , that we &apos;d get bobby out together .
as a family .
and then , uh ...
she ...
she just stopped calling .
how did you get this ?
he , uh , he drew this for me ,
the last time we were together as a family .
he , uh ...
he tore it in half
because he wanted--
wanted me and his mom to both have something of him .
once i thought that sarah was dead ,
i sneaked this in because this is--
this is all i have to make him believe me .
why infiltrate ? why not go to court ?
you &apos;d get custody automatically .
what , do you think these people respond to lawsuits ?
huh ? no , no .
the only hope that i have
is to get close enough to him
to steal him away from wherever they &apos;re keeping him .
which is where ?
i don &apos;t know .
they bring the kids by now and then ,
but they keep them behind closed doors .
well , we &apos;ll find him .
how ?
just leave it to me . keep your head down
and let us do our job . ok ?
you swear ?
you swear that you won &apos;t let me down
and that you will get us both out of here ?
i swear .
we need a stakeout on that house .
he said they bring the kids by intermittently .
i &apos;ll send plainclothes up now .
so now what ? we sit back
and wait until they bring the kids around ?
well , they know we &apos;ve arrested their leader .
that &apos;s a risky plan .
especially since we know grant isn &apos;t the unsub .
how can he not be our guy ?
he &apos;s the one that shows you the face of god at 30 below .
he was genuinely surprised
when we showed him the crime scene photos .
i saw that , too .
he didn &apos;t sanction the murders ,
which means somebody else did them .
a second @-@ tier member pulling a power play , maybe ?
it &apos;d be easier to shoot them and bury them in the desert .
no , this unsub is replicating the cult &apos;s m.o.
even when he knows law enforcement is watching .
except he &apos;s not interested in resuscitating them .
he wants to watch them freeze to death . that &apos;s his compulsion .
he &apos;d be a psychrophile , then ,
somebody with a sexual fetish for the cold .
so let me get this straight .
we &apos;re saying that there &apos;s a serial killer inside the cult ?
talk about a needle in a needlestack .
you know , you can see why the forever people
would be the perfect fit for him , then .
the group would satiate his needs for a while ,
like a pedophile who resorts
to pornography to keep his urges in check ,
and then when he can &apos;t control himself anymore ,
he kills the members that colton wouldn &apos;t miss ,
the ones who were trying to get out .
ok , so let &apos;s go with the pedophile analogy .
you show them pictures , they get excited .
what happened when you showed pictured of two frozen bodies
to members of that house ?
nobody reacted . they just stared blankly .
the unsub isn &apos;t anyone we talked to .
except the kids weren &apos;t inside the house .
and where there &apos;s kids there has to be adult supervision , right ?
the unsub &apos;s watching the children .
and before he was led away ,
colton told me to give a message to all of you .
do not lose faith .
now is the time to meditate on our future .
direct your positivity and strength towards your leader .
he will be with us soon .
peace .
we &apos;ll be now quiet .
you want to help me ?
yeah ? where &apos;s bobby ?
why do you want to know , carl ?
spence . booster seats . the kids are here .
fbi !
what are you doing here ?
this is a private residence .
get her out of here .
you can &apos;t go in there without a warrant .
wrong .
there &apos;s a trailer out back .
come on , guys .
we need to get them into protective custody .
i &apos;ll watch over them myself . we need to regroup with the team .
bobby . where &apos;s bobby ?
here .
did anyone come looking for you while you were here ?
one of the new members , maybe ?
i saw somebody .
who &apos;d you see , sweetie ?
a man , asking about bobby .
then brother jon made him go to sleep .
where &apos;s brother jon now ?
probably back at our house .
where the 5 of us live , i mean .
do you know the address , bobby ?
all right , we got it , jj .
1818 smith street , residence owned by jon kanak .
tell me .
according to the police report ,
he and his parents were hiking
in the wilderness and got lost .
when temperatures fell below freezing ,
they had to do some godawful stuff to say alive .
you have 5 seconds to give me what i want .
jj .
jj , did you hear that ?
uh , yeah .
wait for backup .
no . he already has carl mason .
jj , please wait for us .
i &apos;m already here .
jj , i &apos;m on my way .
hurry .
that &apos;s acetylene gas coming out of there ,
you know what that means ?
ok . let &apos;s -- let &apos;s talk about this , jon .
it means , you pull that trigger and we all die .
ok ? i spark this and we all die .
ok .
ok .
how cold is it in here ?
it &apos;s 18 below .
how long do you think he has ?
enough . because at this temperature ,
the flashpoint of your gas won &apos;t ignite .
jj ? !
sound off !
down here ! do not shoot !
you ok ?
yeah . we need a medic . get a medic .
who &apos;s got a knife ?
there he is .
bobby , i brought someone .
do you remember me ?
no .
well , that &apos;s ok .
do you remember this ?
dad ?
where have you been ?
i &apos;ve been looking for you .
don &apos;t leave , ok ?
i don &apos;t know where mom is .
don &apos;t go .
look at me .
i will never leave . ok ?
i promise . come here .
feeling any better ?
sorry ?
i thought maybe reuniting a family would ...
no .
i &apos;m glad i did my job ,
but this doesn &apos;t go away because of some surrogate .
you know who does think that way ?
serial killers ?
yeah .
hey , uh , i couldn &apos;t find that word
you asked for ,
but i also didn &apos;t want it to be
tivon askari anymore ,
so i called emily .
i didn &apos;t tell her anything .
i just asked her to pull any extra background intel she could .
apparently people are much more willing to talk about a terrorist
once he &apos;s dead .
anyway , i put it in your old office
in case you wanted some privacy .
you don &apos;t have to look at it if you don &apos;t want .
good night .
spence .
tivon askari grew up an orphan
on the streets of tikrit .
he survived as a homeless child from ages 7 to 9 .
he was raped for the first time at the age of 10 .
by the age of 13 , he had killed 3 people .
violence became a sexual act .
men , women , children .
it didn &apos;t matter .
by the time i joined the iraqi national guard as an interrogator ,
i had everything i needed .
life became a simple equation .
how long until you break ?
you broke me .
oh , no .
i bent you .
i wanted to do so much worse .
you took my baby .
yes .
i did .
and it pleased me greatly .
why am i not past you ?
for a year i &apos;ve been fine .
have you ?
what do you want from me ?
i have nothing left .
you &apos;ve taken everything .
oh , jennifer ,
there is so much more i &apos;m going to take .
first , i &apos;m going to take your sleep .
then , your smile .
i won &apos;t let you feel safe anywhere .
so i &apos;ll take your job .
and finally ,
i will transform you
so that your husband and your son
won &apos;t recognize you anymore .
you can &apos;t .
i won &apos;t let you .
you already are .
think about the risk you took at that freezer .
you had no idea that the gas would ignite or not .
it was dumb luck that you got out of there alive .
either you will try that again ...
and i will watch you kill yourself ,
or you will quit ...
and i will watch you wither and fade .
either way ,
i win .
no .
yes .
no !
