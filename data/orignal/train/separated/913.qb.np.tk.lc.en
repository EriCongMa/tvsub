my brother barry was the world champion of the goldberg house .
athletics flowed through his veins .
sports !
yep , in our family , barry was the undisputed jock ,
mainly &apos; cause i never disputed it .
swish , baby !
holy balls !
it only took 173 tries !
it took dr. j 200 times .
don &apos;t look it up . just take my words as fact .
calling my shot .
right @-@ field bleachers . give it to me , adam .
come on , baby !
he had it all -- strength , passion , and delusion .
yes ! left field , which is your right , so it still counts !
dude , how do the phillies not recruit you right now ,
fresh out of high school ?
that &apos;s what i ask when i call them !
truth was , i may have been a tad responsible
for over @-@ inflating his ego .
tonight , we celebrate excellence on and off the field .
i give you the william penn academy
athlete of the year .
not only is this student a gifted sportsman ,
but he &apos;s a born leader , and , damn it ,
i &apos;d follow him anywhere .
snap some photos after he calls my name .
of course , you all know who i &apos;m talking about --
ruben amaro , jr .
boom ! yes ! yes !
yes !
student athletes , parents , faculty ,
and distinguished guests ,
i am privileged and honored to accept this award .
goldberg , what the hell are you doing ?
i said ruben amaro , jr .
what ? how is that even possible ?
well , he &apos;s an athletic superstar ,
and you are our mascot .
now put on the giant head and dance for our champ .
this is bullcrap .
what does ruben amaro , jr. have that i don &apos;t ?
um , four @-@ year varsity letterman in baseball ,
the home @-@ run record , and i &apos;m pretty sure he &apos;s got
a full scholarship to stanford .
anyone could play baseball . i play wiffle .
yes , the only sport where the equipment
is sold in a pharmacy .
well , at the very least , coach should recognize
my insane hoop skills .
sweetie , you &apos;re not even on the basketball team .
&apos;cause i play street ball .
my flash and pizzazz can &apos;t be contained in a gymnasium .
and don &apos;t get me started on my boomerang skills .
i won &apos;t .
i &apos;d like to see ruben amaro , jr. chuck a &apos; rang .
stupid , selfish showboat .
this night was supposed to be about barry goldberg .
i don &apos;t think it was .
but hey , you &apos;ll always be my champion .
that &apos;s just worthless .
but thank you .
barry &apos;s dream of becoming an athletic superstar
was at an all @-@ time low , but that all changed
when he watched the biggest underdog story
in olympic history on the news --
the story of eddie the eagle .
look at him go , lucky .
a week ago , nobody knew who this guy was .
but today , he &apos;s a legend .
a legend that would inspire my brother
on his path to greatness .
is that guy wearing his glasses under his ski goggles ?
that &apos;s eddie the eagle . he &apos;s an actual olympic athlete .
how ? he looks like a guy that works at the post office .
exactly . he &apos;s the only dude from england to do ski @-@ jumping .
this nobody just walked right into olympic glory .
this changes everything .
you &apos;re right ! i &apos;m gonna be a champion !
olympics , here i come , baby !
watch out .
champi ...
god , those are steep .
champion !
it was february 24 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and my dad was doing what he did best -- saving money .
which one of you morons cranked up the heat to 55 ?
how is that cranked up ?
i &apos;m wearing my spider @-@ man long underwear ,
which , yes , feels like a fun little secret ,
but it shouldn &apos;t be necessary in the house .
he &apos;s right , mur . it &apos;s freezing in here .
at least start a fire .
are you nuts ?
you think firewood grows on trees ?
yes , that &apos;s what trees are -- wood .
well , keep your hands off .
and turn off the damn lights !
we don &apos;t support the electric company .
hey , we &apos;re still in here .
it &apos;s after 6 : 00 ! go to bed !
my dad had always been frugal , but lately ,
he was getting worse .
that &apos;s two whole ounces of milk right there .
pour it back .
but it &apos;s blue from all the boo berry .
berries are healthy . pour it back .
even his co @-@ workers at the furniture store
were feeling the squeeze .
hi .
picking up or dropping --
oh , god , it &apos;s you !
hello ? vic ?
we &apos;re closed . come back later .
vic , i see you .
what are you doing in a photo shack ?
murray kind of cut back my hours .
oh , no .
is it &apos; cause you &apos;re so terrible at selling furniture ?
no . wait , does murray say that ?
are things not going well at the store ?
oh , well , you know the furniture game .
it &apos;s ... but , no , they &apos;re not .
what ?
but do me a favor .
don &apos;t tell murray you heard it from me , okay ?
of course , vic . i permiss .
did you just say &quot; permiss &quot; ?
no , i said &quot; i pormiss . &quot;
por-- por--
i pormiss .
wait , what ?
got to go !
my mom wasn &apos;t one to break a promise .
a &quot; pormiss &quot; was a different story .
hey ! bevy !
what a fun surprise !
yeah . just came to see the big guy in action .
so , how &apos;s it going ?
hoo @-@ hoo ! been slammed .
slammed , huh ?
must have missed the rush .
well , you know , it comes in waves .
as a matter of fact , i should get back to work .
oh , so , so busy .
sold two of these .
this baby -- gone .
sold it . shouldn &apos;t have been sitting in it .
and you &apos;re not gonna believe this .
somebody bought a register !
ka @-@ ching , ka @-@ ching , ka @-@ ching ! look at us !
as my dad was hiding his troubles from my mom ,
barry was unleashing his inner champion .
what &apos;s with the board , douche lords ?
just deciding which olympic sport
will make barry a national hero .
deal with it !
okay , stop .
you &apos;re not eddie the eagle ,
and you &apos;re never gonna win at ... curling ?
what the hell is that ?
isn &apos;t it genius ? no one knows .
it &apos;s a sport where you sweep a rock across a sheet of ice .
it takes incredible focus and patience .
moving on . how about dressage ?
yes ! i &apos;ll win the gold at whatever that is !
it &apos;s an equestrian event ,
which is the elegant art of horse dancing .
i told you , bro ! i will never dance with a horse !
never !
what is your deal with horses ?
they know what they did .
you &apos;re right . moving on . rhythmic gymnastics .
oh , you mean ribbon dancing ?
yes , please do that . i beg you .
i sense your mocking tone . you know who else got mocked ?
edward &quot; eddie the eagle &quot; edwards .
his name is edward edwards ?
look , i don &apos;t know all the details .
i &apos;m just basing my life on him . geez .
in that case , let &apos;s get you a ribbon .
it &apos;s everything i thought it would be and more .
the ribbon just takes me where it wants .
look at him go .
not part of the routine .
help me !
don &apos;t worry . we &apos;ll find a sport for you .
how are you with skiing and guns ?
never done it , but i &apos;m awesome at it .
stop . just stop . admit it .
the only sport you &apos;re good at is that stupid brother game
you invented to beat the crap out of each other .
ball @-@ ball !
ball @-@ ball !
one awesome thing about
having an older brother was the sports we &apos;d make up .
racquet round !
the rules were endless and complicated ...
sleep !
... but no matter what , you had to yell ...
ball @-@ ball !
yes !
dude , you &apos;re unbeatable !
this is the answer , erica !
if i get ball @-@ ball into the olympics ,
you &apos;ll know i &apos;ll bring home the gold .
giant problem -- some dumbass game you play in the basement
will never be an olympic sport .
that &apos;s what they said about soccer .
he &apos;s right . i heard that .
no , you didn &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t , but he said it with such confidence i agree .
we will rule the world !
while my brother had found his road to gold ,
my mother was worried my dad was on the road to ruin .
you should have seen the store , dad .
completely abandoned .
i just don &apos;t understand why he won &apos;t ask me for help .
this is how murray &apos;s dad raised him .
be proud . don &apos;t ask for a hand @-@ out .
solve it yourself .
well , you raised me to offer support and guidance
and strong @-@ arm anyone into doing exactly what i want .
that &apos;s what you thought i meant when i said ,
&quot; follow your dreams &quot; ?
yes .
my dad was too proud to ask for help ,
so my mom decided to force it on him .
bevy !
hello , murray .
i see you found the solution to all your problems .
what am i looking at ? i &apos;m confused and angry .
it &apos;s a fa @-@ ton .
a what ?
a fa @-@ ton .
fa @-@ ton ?
fa @-@ ton .
fa @-@ ton .
fa @-@ ton ? !
fa @-@ ton .
a what ?
fa @-@ ton .
it &apos;s japanese .
it &apos;s a couch but also ...
a bed !
it &apos;s the origami of furniture .
what is it doing in the only room in the world that i like ?
murray , i know about the furniture store .
i saw vic in that tiny little photo house .
it was sad .
look , i don &apos;t need anyone &apos;s help .
and i definitely don &apos;t need a fa @-@ ton .
just one fa @-@ ton .
no fa @-@ tons .
as my dad was refusing help to sell furniture ,
barry was hoping to sell ball @-@ ball to the masses .
friends , jtp ...
jtp !
girlfriend ,
ponytail burnouts .
sup ?
i &apos;ve gathered you here today
&apos;cause you &apos;re the taste @-@ makers of the school .
you know it .
big time .
we &apos;ll eat anything .
i present to you ball @-@ ball , a high @-@ octane sport of the future ,
and it &apos;s the coolest ,
newest club in school .
what the hell , man ?
you told me this was a rush appreciation club .
i &apos;m letting you in on the ground floor .
&apos;cause what we have here , it &apos;s more than a game .
it &apos;s a way of life .
i &apos;ve played it .
they &apos;re definitely overselling it , but it &apos;s fine .
i heard i get to hit you in the testicles .
when do i get to do that ?
love the enthusiasm !
now , i &apos;m not only president of this club .
i &apos;m also ball @-@ ball champion of the world .
so i will naturally dominate , so do not be discouraged .
all right , everyone out !
ruben amaro , jr. has to break in some new sneakers .
but i signed out the gym for my new ball @-@ ball club .
what is this ? how &apos;s it work ?
ah , there &apos;s like a thousand rules . too complicated for you .
bro , it &apos;s ruben amaro , jr . let him in our club .
yeah , you want this to go big , right ?
well , he &apos;s the best athlete in school .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s confirmed he &apos;s the best athlete in school .
and honestly , i &apos;m not sure he &apos;s ready to play game like this .
watch and learn .
ball @-@ ball !
oh , no ! he caught it with one hand .
that &apos;s a ball @-@ buster bonus .
a penalty shot at barry &apos;s face or nards .
your choice .
nards ! definitely the nards !
hey , adam , pal , maybe ease up on the rules until --
sweetie , are you okay ?
he didn &apos;t say &quot; ball @-@ ball . &quot;
this game is amazing ! i &apos;m telling everyone in school !
hey , coach , i like this club .
ruben amaro , jr. is in . it is officially a club .
score ! we did it !
wait , is this little kid playing with us ?
&apos;cause maybe i &apos;ll take a rain check .
if ruben hates it , i hate it , too .
actually , i &apos;m barry &apos;s coach .
no ! i don &apos;t even know who this kid is !
get out of here , strange child .
but this is our sport . we invented it together .
well , sometimes in life , you make hard choices .
this is an easy one . bye , adam .
turns out barry added a new rule
to our beloved ball @-@ ball -- stabbing me in the back .
despite my dad &apos;s struggle at the store ,
he forbid my mom from getting involved .
it did not stick .
surprise !
it &apos;s a fa @-@ ton .
i know it &apos;s a fa @-@ ton . we discussed the fa @-@ ton .
get the fa @-@ ton out of my store !
i believe it &apos;s pronounced &quot; fu @-@ ton . &quot;
i &apos;ll handle this .
hello , sir .
what fine piece of luxury furniture
can i put you in today ?
oh . is that one of those new futons ?
why , yes . they &apos;re very comfortable .
no . ignore that thing .
these people don &apos;t even work here .
see , i have a small condo ,
and this would really save a lot of room .
not to mention a lot of money .
here . sit down . or lie down .
the choice is yours .
wait , what if i told you
i have a bed combined with a small lake ?
you see that ?
you see how it &apos;s gently rocking me to sleep ?
waterbed . yeah , i don &apos;t know .
it seems kind of &apos; 70s .
this bed is so damn relaxing !
really ? &apos; cause you look more agitated .
it &apos;s like being in the freaking bahamas .
come on . lay down next to me .
lay your body next to mine and feel what i feel .
yeah , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m gonna go futon .
wonderful .
vic will ring you up since he &apos;s not doing anything .
i &apos;m taking this commission .
we did it .
see what happens when you accept a little help ?
you want to help ? great . the store is yours .
what are you talking about ?
if i &apos;m not needed here , i quit .
you can &apos;t quit ! you &apos;re the boss !
well , now you &apos;re the boss .
well , if i &apos;m the boss , then i hire you back as my boss ,
and i quit .
fine . i &apos;m the boss ?
well , then i &apos;m leaving you in charge forever !
that day , my dad wasn &apos;t the only one
being beaten at his own game .
ball @-@ ball .
ball @-@ ball .
ball @-@ ball .
ball @-@ ball .
oh ! damn it ! rematch !
maybe i should play johnny atkins or carla .
you know , make it fair .
fair ?
what are you saying ?
he &apos;s saying you suck , goldberg . hit the bricks .
crazy girl &apos;s right , goldberg .
people are playing . get off the court .
but i &apos;m club president .
i thought ruben was .
good idea .
ruben amaro , jr . , you &apos;re club president .
but i invented this game !
dude , you invented ruben @-@ ball ?
well done , barry . well done .
appreciate the support , bro , but it &apos;s not time to celebrate .
i &apos;m not supporting you . this is a sarcastic clap .
what ? a sarcastic clap goes like this .
which is exactly what i &apos;m doing , dude .
no , you &apos;re doing this .
that &apos;s a slow clap for a champion .
no , that &apos;s not a slow clap . this is .
oh , my god . can &apos;t you hear the difference ?
you &apos;re not watching what i &apos;m doing . watch what i &apos;m doing .
you &apos;re not hearing it ! hear the patterns . it &apos;s a rhythm .
you &apos;ve had no rhythm our whole life .
you &apos;re not watching what i &apos;m doing !
just look ! just like this !
forget the clap !
all i know is , first ,
you kick me out of the game we created .
then you sucked at it and lost it forever .
sucked ?
sucked !
for years , i thought
you were the greatest athlete on the planet .
turns out , you &apos;re , like , not good .
just like me .
you take that back .
never ! you and me are the same .
that is the single @-@ most hurtful thing
anyone has ever said to me .
the same .
don &apos;t support me now with your applause .
it &apos;s too late .
since i left you in charge of the store ,
i thought you might want to see what &apos;s happening .
&quot; going out of business &quot; sale ?
murray , that &apos;s brilliant !
no , no , since you insist on running the store ,
i &apos;m calling it quits and really going out of business .
hon , furniture stores do this all the time .
everybody knows it &apos;s not real .
but it is real !
it &apos;s also the same exact ad you ran three times last year .
what do you think of that ?
it &apos;s fantastic !
no , no , no , read it .
it &apos;s says &quot; seriously &quot; and &quot; for real this time ! &quot;
gotcha .
right here in black and white .
&quot; it &apos;s all over !
this is not just one of those things furniture stores do
to sell more furniture !
it &apos;s ... totally ... real ! &quot;
you , sir , are a genius !
if i &apos;m so good , why did you come down to the furniture store
and mix in ?
i was helping .
see , that &apos;s the thing , bev .
i didn &apos;t ask for your help .
wait , where are you going ?
anywhere but here .
oh , look . dad &apos;s having another &quot; going out of business &quot; sale .
so , instead of closing down the store ,
my dad decided to move in .
stupid , giant water balloon !
and he found comfort in the last place he expected .
that &apos;s damn nice .
the next morning , we found barry &apos;s sports gear
in the last place we expected .
barry , what the -- what are you doing ?
making a bonfire .
i &apos;ve officially quit all of sports ,
and i &apos;m burning everything i own .
canoeing isn &apos;t even a sport . it &apos;s a leisure activity .
not the way i did it .
goodbye , extreme canoeing .
and farewell to you , boomerang .
i mean it !
i don &apos;t want you here ! go on ! get out of here !
damn you !
let me live my life !
dude , what did you do to him ?
told him the truth !
he &apos;s not some champion . he &apos;s a scrub like me .
dear lord , man . do you realize what you &apos;ve done ?
sports are everything to barry , and you just took them away .
why do i matter so much ? i &apos;m just his brother .
deep down , barry knows
that out in the world , he &apos;s not some champion .
but in this house , you make him feel like one .
i -- i do ?
yes .
you idolize him .
that &apos;s what little brothers do .
i didn &apos;t realize that .
good news is that even though you destroyed him ,
you can still build him back up .
goodbye , tennis racquet / air guitar .
well , that was my racquet .
but sure , i &apos;ll build him back up .
after crushing barry &apos;s spirits ,
i decided i couldn &apos;t let him throw away his dreams ,
or all his sports stuff .
what are you doing ? i threw this junk out .
i brought it back in &apos; cause we &apos;re not done with it yet .
come here . check out the board .
forget olympic glory . i &apos;m not a champion .
i &apos;m not even eddie the eagle . i &apos;m nothing .
maybe out there .
but in here , you &apos;re barry the eagle .
yeah , maybe you won &apos;t be in the winter or summer games ,
but we got something way better .
i give you ...
the home games .
the home games ? that &apos;s not a thing .
neither was ball @-@ ball .
well , thanks to me , we lost it to ruben amaro , jr .
let him have it , &apos; cause we now got
17 homemade games combining athletic skill , bravery ,
stupidity , and karate .
what about boomerang ?
oh , we be &apos; rangin &apos; bro . we be &apos; rangin &apos; .
but only one champion in this house can take the gold .
light the torch . let the games begin .
that fateful day , we hung up our ball @-@ ball gear .
sure , we lost one absurd brotherly game ,
but we gained a tradition that would last a lifetime .
my brother never made it to the olympics
like eddie the eagle , but that day ,
he sure felt like him .
what &apos;s up ?
morning , sunshine !
it &apos;s 11 : 15 .
we just sold six futons ,
thanks to you sleeping so peacefully .
is that supposed to make me feel better ?
look , mur , when i first opened this place ,
business was lousy .
it was so bad , my in @-@ laws would buy furniture
they didn &apos;t even need .
every room in their house had three beds .
why would they do something so stupid ?
to help me .
that &apos;s what family does . we take care of each other .
there &apos;s no shame in that .
yeah , well , it feels like there is .
i know that &apos;s how it was in your family ,
but now you &apos;re my family .
and this is how we do it .
did you ... fold stuff ?
figured you gave me a hand ,
thought i could return the favor .
look , murray , i know selling furniture is your thing ,
and i &apos;m sorry that i --
oh , no , no , no . this is on me .
the store -- it &apos;s struggling , bevy .
and truthfully , i could really use your help .
i never thought you &apos;d ask .
but he did .
for the first time , my dad broke down and asked for help .
thanks to my mom , it really did pay off .
that &apos;s the thing about family --
they &apos;re always there to pick you up when you fall .
and if you &apos;re lucky ,
they help you soar like an eagle named eddie .
we did it , baby !
hell , yeah , we did .
i &apos;m one of the announcers here at our home games competition .
okay , we can all agree this year &apos;s home games
was a raging success , but looking ahead ,
i want to legitimize the competition .
allow me to introduce next year &apos;s new event --
can you feel that ?
like the name . how &apos;s it work ?
yeah , barry , how does this work ?
best we learn by demonstration . gentlemen , raise your bats .
w @-@ wait , what ?
on your mark . get set . go .
wait ! shouldn &apos;t i also have a helmet ? !
can you feel that ?
right there , right there . you feel that ?
nothing ? anything ?
actually , no .
i support whatever this is .
hey , erica ! check me out ! i &apos;m tough and sexy !
