Listening to his closing argument,
I almost want to let him go myself,
except for one thing-- He's a liar.
He thinks he doesn't have to play by the same rules.
But we know he does.
What did you do?
I pled guilty.
If you think I'm gonna let you do this,
you're out of your goddamn mind.
He cut a deal to save this firm.
He cut a deal to keep us from going to prison.
We give Evan people who already want to go,
and I give Anita Gibbs murderers in exchange for Mike.
And what if it doesn't work and we lose everything?
Then we do. But if we don't try to save him, who are we?
Make the deal.
I am not letting you go to prison
for a crime that I committed.
I'm not letting you go when you're gonna be found innocent!
Why the hell would you lie to me?
'Cause the truth would've broken you.
You know what, Harvey?
You want to come to my wedding, you let me know.
I'm not trying to take your place anymore.
I'm trying to get you ready because you're weak.
Harvey, I am not weak.
Yeah? Well, hit me.
Is this what you want?
That I hate you and that you made me do this?
We lose everything because of you!
I am not saying that I don't want to get married.
You go finish law school.
And then in two years, when I get out,
if you still want to marry me...
They're all gone.
Watch your back in there, Mike.
I will.
General wake-up for all inmates is at 6:00 A.M.
You will be standing next to your bed at that time.
If you are not, you will face disciplinary action.
At least five inmate counts
will be held during each 24-hour period at random times.
You will stand still during every one of those counts.
If you are not, you will face disciplinary action.
You will be at meals on time if you want to eat.
You will be at work on time, no matter what.
You will keep your cell in a clean and sanitary condition.
If you fail in any of these areas, you will face...
Disciplinary action.
Good. You're getting the picture.
Do you mind if I ask what disciplinary action means?
Since you got the balls to ask that,
I'm sure you're gonna find out soon enough.
What's this for?
What do you think it's for?
Strip naked, put everything you own inside that bag,
then follow me.
Harvey, what are you doing here?
I came to let you know that I dropped him off,
and, um, he looks as good as he could look.
And I think he's gonna be okay.
I appreciate that.
But you could have told me that over the phone.
So what are you really doing here?
I miss him.
I miss him too.
Where the hell are you going?
Where do you think I'm going?
I'm going home, Louis.
Look, don't you get it?
They're all gone-- every single one of them.
Yeah, well, we knew that already.
No, no, I don't think you understand.
I'm not just talking about the partners.
I'm talking about everyone, from the accountants
to the secretaries to the guy who shines my shoes, Donna.
All of them, gone.
And what exactly do you want me to do about it?
I want you to get Harvey on the goddamn phone.
Well, I'm not gonna do that.
Why not?
Because tonight's not the night to call Harvey.
Why, because of Mike?
I don't know if you've noticed, but Mike is gone,
along with everybody else.
And if we don't figure something out by tonight,
we are gonna be left with nothing.
I didn't say we weren't gonna figure something out, Louis.
I said we're not calling Harvey.
Well, then what the hell are we gonna do?
Right now I'm gonna go to my office
and fix myself a goddamn drink.
The first time I met him?
What do you think I thought? I...
I thought he was an idiot.
Imagine how I felt
when a bunch of weed spilled out of his briefcase
ten seconds after he walked into his interview.
I know. You were so horrified, you got on the phone,
and you called the police.
No, wait. You didn't do that.
You offered the idiot a job.
That's because after I heard his story,
I knew he wasn't an idiot after all.
And I knew by the end of that first morning
that he wasn't like anyone I'd ever met,
and that if I wasn't careful, I was gonna be in trouble.
To trouble.
To trouble.
Look at that. Louis left me a voice mail.
I don't understand. You seem happy about that.
That's because one of my favorite pastimes
is to listen to one of Louis's messages.
What if he's upset about something?
He's always upset about something.
That's why one of my favorite pastimes
is to listen to one of Louis's messages.
Damn it, Harvey, pick up the goddamn phone,
because this entire firm is a ghost town,
and I'm sorry Mike's in prison,
but if we don't figure something out,
what you and your little sidekick did
is gonna be the end of us.
And don't give me some bullshit about tonight isn't the time,
because--
I got to go.
Yeah, I know. I'm coming with you.
Rachel, you heard what Louis said.
This is gonna be a rough night. You need to stay here.
Harvey, it's gonna be a rough night no matter where I am.
And at least if I'm with you,
there's a chance that I could be of some use.
You better get your coat, because we don't have much time.
Now what?
Now you get dressed, and you wait.
Would you like some more drinks?
Can I offer you an appetizer, maybe some truffle fries,
or are we allowed to talk business now?
All right, Louis, what do you think we should do,
since it was your recommendation
that landed us in this mess in the first place?
I recommended that because it was a last-ditch effort
to get Mike out of prison.
And you also said we'd only lose 50%
of our partners to Evan Smith.
How could I have known that she had the capacity
to bring on more than that?
Don't you get it? The rest didn't go to Evan Smith.
They just walked the hell out and went somewhere else.
Then we can sue their asses.
With what lawyers, what resources, and what money?
Because I don't know if you noticed,
but this firm has been gutted because of your recommendation.
No, Jessica, it was gutted because of mine.
Damn it, Louis. I told you not to call him.
Well, I did. Because he's a partner,
and like he just said, he was the one
who wanted to sever the noncompetes in the first place.
You're right, Louis. I did.
But I didn't come down here
to play Pin the Blame on the Harvey.
I came down here to figure out what the hell we're gonna do.
Then let's get to it.
May I help you?
Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but there was no one at reception,
and I have your order here.
You got to be kidding me.
You call me down here for an emergency,
and then you take the time to order Chinese food?
I didn't order anything, asshole.
So you crouch your tiger, hide your dragon,
or I'm gonna Wang Chung your ass out of here.
Louis, calm down. Clearly, there's some mistake.
No one at this firm has ordered any food.
Well, I'm pretty sure this is the right place,
because the name on your door says Jessica Pearson,
and this order is for a Jessica Pearson.
Yeah this is Jessica Pearson.
Louis!
What?
They know I'm not really here
to bring you an egg roll, asshole.
I'm here to serve you with this.
What is that?
It's a class action.
We're being sued for every case Mike Ross has ever touched.
That's why they all left.
They knew this was coming, and they got out
so they could all have it on record
that they were gone before the suit came down.
Then we need to know who the hell tipped them off.
It doesn't matter who tipped them off.
What matters is, if we lose this suit,
we can't handle the money.
How much are they suing us for?
$100 million.
God damn it.
We need to get those partners back.
I told you, we're never gonna get them back.
And right now we don't even know where they went.
I do.
How the hell did you pull that off?
Because lawyers don't talk to lawyers,
but secretaries talk to secretaries.
That is a list of who went where.
Okay, we need a paper trail tonight--
notices of breach of contract--
and we need to get on record
that those partners aren't off the hook.
It's too late to send out notices.
We already got served with the lawsuit.
He didn't record the time.
Donna, there's $5,000 in the cigar box on my desk.
Get it now.
Wait. Where the hell are you going?
I'm going downstairs
to tell that server he can have every nickel of it
to say he didn't deliver that thing for another two hours.
Assuming Harvey doesn't shit the bed,
we've got two hours to figure out
how we're gonna serve every partner on this list.
Give me that list.
They can consider themselves served,
because Louis Marlowe Litt never backs down from a fight.
Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury.
Yes, I'm--I'm calling to check on an--
Inmate?
Yeah. His name is Michael Ross, and he--
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I can't give out information regarding inmates.
Would you at least be able to tell me
if he's been processed yet?
If he surrendered himself,
then he has been processed.
Okay, so does that mean that he's in a cell now or--
Ma'am, I'm a prison administrator, not a hotel concierge.
I don't know the whereabouts of any given inmate at any given time.
Okay, would you be able to tell me when I can see him?
Are you his spouse or immediate family?
No.
Then you'll have to go through the approval process.
But he doesn't have any immediate family,
and I'm his fiancée.
And unless you have a filed marriage certificate,
you'll have to wait till next month.
Next month?
Look, am I--am I allowed to ask your name?
My name is Ruth.
Ruth, Mike and I were...
supposed to be married today, but we weren't.
And I can't stop thinking about him,
and I'm not gonna be able to sleep
unless I know that he's gonna be okay.
He's in prison, ma'am.
I really couldn't say.
I am sorry.
Nothing like prison blue to make you realize
the clothes don't make the man, huh?
Warden Clark?
Me?
No.
Who told you you were going to meet the warden?
Uh, no one. I-I just thought--
That this was going to be like a prison movie.
都出自《肖申克的救赎》
"Put your trust in the Lord,
but your ass belongs to me" type shit.
You know "Shawshank"?
Of course you know "Shawshank."
You work in a prison.
No, brother, I know "Shawshank"
because it's the greatest movie ever made. Here...
What's this?
Your psychological evaluation.
Why do I need a psychological evaluation?
Because the federal penitentiary system says you do.
Now, when I get back, if there's a hole in the mirror
covered by a Rita Hayworth poster,
I will not be happy.
Okay, Louis, calm down.
You've had a few misfires, possibly had a stroke,
but you can do this.
You've entered the requisite information.
You calibrated the typeface perfectly.
All you have to do is press "send,"
and those sons of bitches are about to get Litt the hell up.
God damn mother--
What the hell are you doing?
I'm just doing a little troubleshooting. Why?
That is a $400,000 piece of hardware,
and you have no business even--
Wait a second. What are you still doing here?
What any IT officer worth his salt would do.
I'm maintaining our system, so it appears we're still
a functioning law firm to the outside world.
Can you electronically serve legal notice
to every partner in the next two hours?
As long as you've got their official business addresses,
I can do it in the next two minutes.
Well, it's a good thing I have them right here.
Um, no offense, but I'm really more of a lone ranger.
Excuse me?
I can get this done in a more efficient manner
without you looking over my shoulder.
Well, that's what I told my mother
when I looked at my first "Playboy."
But it didn't happen then, and it's not gonna happen now.
Well, that doesn't matter because...
we have a problem.
So you're saying, in this office,
at any given moment,
there's $100,000 hidden away.
That's what I'm saying.
Where?
I'm not telling you.
Whatever the hell you two are in the middle of,
it's gonna have to wait,
because secretaries may talk to secretaries,
but liars talk to idiots.
Louis, what the hell are you talking about?
I'm saying that that list is a bucket of bullshit,
and the mighty Donna Paulsen--
she doesn't know her ass from her elbow.
Watch yourself, Louis.
I don't need to watch myself, Harvey.
See, I don't know if you've noticed,
but we're being sued for a $100 million.
The partners are gone, and we can't stop them.
Maybe we don't have to stop them.
What are you saying?
What I want to know right now is what we're all worth.
What, are you kidding?
Why don't you just jam a cattle prod up my ass?
It would be less invasive.
I'll jam my fist in your face
if you don't start getting with the program.
There you go, resorting to violence, like you always do.
Because you don't want to admit this whole thing
is your fault in the first place.
My fault? If I hadn't brought Mike in,
you'd still be here sniveling around
like a goddamn junior partner.
And if I hadn't given Donna back to you,
you'd still be having panic attacks
like a goddamn little girl.
Louis!
You smug son of a bitch.
That's enough!
I just watched the man that I love go to prison
so none of you have to.
And it hasn't been five minutes...
And you're already ripping each other apart.
Rachel...
Let me finish.
I thought I wanted to be alone tonight.
And then I realized that I didn't,
because I wanted to be with my family.
But if you can't keep it together tonight...
of all nights, then as far as I'm concerned...
you can all rot in hell.
Well, I'm gonna say what she won't.
This is all on you.
Louis, this is the last place I wanted to be tonight too,
but I came back here to save my firm anyway.
But if you're gonna be the same old Louis
and we're going to do the same old dance,
then maybe you and this firm can both go rot in hell.
Louis, I don't want to hear it.
Well, that's good, because I'm not here to say it.
Are you saying you didn't come down here
to tell me Harvey can go to hell?
I'm saying I came down here to tell you,
if Harvey wants to go...
we should let him.
Louis.
Jessica, you once told me,
no matter what happens,
Pearson will always consider Litt her partner,
which means whatever happens with Harvey...
we can do this together.
What do you say-- you and me?
Pearson Litt.
You say no.
No, Louis--
I should have known.
You never wanted me.
All you ever wanted was your precious Harvey.
Louis, you have no idea what I want.
And my hesitation has nothing to do with you.
Then what exactly does it have to do with?
Louis...
I have put everything I have into keeping this firm afloat
for as long as I can remember.
Well, now look around you.
The ship isn't sinking. It sunk.
And I don't know if I have it in me
to pull it back up
from the bottom of the ocean.
Finally.
Excuse me?
They came and took that thing away three hours ago.
I've been sitting here twiddling my thumbs ever since.
You were not twiddling your thumbs.
You were waiting for me to go over the results of that thing.
And the results are you are full of shit.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
I answered every one of those questions honestly.
I didn't say you didn't.
Well, in that case, I guess you didn't get the memo.
We're in a prison filled with con men.
Everyone here is full of shit.
And the difference between you and them
is they know they are.
What does that even mean?
It means that they know they don't have the patience
to earn what they want,
and that's why they go out and steal it from other people.
So that's why you left me in here all that time,
just to prove that I have no patience.
Evaluation number two, narcissistic tendencies.
The world does not revolve around you.
You know what? I don't have to listen to this.
No, you don't, because my day is done.
And I'm going to go home,
pour myself a cold beer
while you get settled in cell 42
on the south end of D block.
Yeah, I get it.
I'm no longer Mike Ross.
I'm just inmate number 53296.
No, you're still Mike Ross.
But my job is to help you become a better version of him
when you leave than when you came in.
And if you trust me, that just might happen.
Trust you?
You came in here before acting like you were on my side.
Let's get one thing straight.
I didn't act anything.
You waltzed in here thinking
this was gonna be like some prison movie.
Well, it's not, so get that through your head.
It's not a movie, brother.
It's just prison.
律师事务所
Don't you dare push that button.
You're not leaving, Harvey, not tonight.
Yes, I am.
Well, if you really mean that,
then you're not the man I thought you were.
What did you just say to me?
I said that underneath that expensive suit
and that perfect record is a coward
ready to run from one of the biggest fights of his life.
I am not running from anything, Donna,
and I don't need this right now.
No, Harvey, right now is exactly when you need this,
because tomorrow's gonna be too late.
I know what I'm doing.
Then why don't you enlighten me?
Because I, for one,
would love to know exactly what you're doing.
I'm gonna go the hell home and never look back.
And what about tomorrow?
I don't care about tomorrow.
Well, maybe you should start caring about tomorrow,
because if you don't,
you're gonna wake up three weeks from now,
and you're gonna realize that this
was the biggest mistake of your life,
and all you did was give up
exactly what Mike went to prison to save.
Mike did not go to prison to save this goddamn firm.
No, Harvey, he went to prison to save us.
And now you're walking out on us.
And if you're gonna do that, then tell me,
what did he save us for?
Let's get one thing straight.
You waltzed in here thinking
this was gonna be like a prison movie.
Well, it's not.
Ross.
It's not a movie, brother.
It's just prison.
It's just prison.
Ross.
Did you hear me?
We gonna have trouble your first night?
No.
Then get in there.
One more thing...
you're not authorized to leave this cell the rest of the night.
Jessica, I'm sorry.
You know, this used to be my desk.
Different desk, same spot.
Jackson was there, Burns was there,
and Kleiman was by the door.
He hated being by the door.
I don't know any of those names.
Because they got out a long time ago,
because this life isn't for everyone.
And it's harder on some than it is on others.
What are you saying?
I'm saying that...
for women, the rules are different.
You can't be everyone's friend
and invite them to tea because...
warm means you're weak.
I wasn't gonna be weak.
But now the flip side to that is,
if you're strong, they think you're cold.
And that's why they're all gone...
because they see me as...
as unfeeling and manipulative.
I'm tired of it.
Well, they're wrong.
You're just saying that
because you're seeing me like this.
No, that has nothing to do with it.
My dad told me
that the only reason he came to the church today
was because you told him if he didn't,
he would lose me forever.
And you didn't do that
because you were trying to manipulate some situation.
You did it because you care.
And because you did it,
I will be loyal to you forever.
What can I do for you, Harvey?
I came to tell you that I'm sorry.
You should be.
I know.
So you gonna give me a tongue lashing,
or you want to figure out how we can get out of this jackpot?
I think that right now you and me and Louis
should get in a room and smoke a peace pipe.
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
I sure as hell am.
And where exactly are we gonna get that shit
this late at night?
'Cause the coffee cart guy is long gone.
It just so happens
I like to brew my own coffee from time to time.
I'm gonna go get a drink.
That stuff's illegal, you know.
Put that down.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--
Touch my stuff?
Funny, I didn't see the picture jump into your hands by itself.
Look, I was just--
Relax, I'm just giving you shit.
That's my little nephew-- sweet kid,
dumb as a box of rocks.
Welcome to Danbury. What's your name?
Mike. Mike Ross.
Frank Gallo.
Well, Mike, looks like we're gonna be sharing
this little condo for a while.
Feel like telling me what you're in for?
I get it. You don't know if you can trust me.
Listen, truth is, you shouldn't trust anybody in here.
Except I just asked what you did,
and they obviously already caught you,
so what's the harm?
Well, if there's no harm,
then why don't you tell me what you're in for?
That could take a while.
I don't know about you,
but I'm free for the next two years.
Careful.
See, now you've told me how long you're in for.
Starts there, ends with you telling me
you were born a poor black child.
You know "The Jerk"?
Yeah, you know "The Jerk"?
Yeah, I watched a lot of movies growing up.
We watch a lot of movies in here.
All right, you want to know my story?
It starts long before I did what I did,
because I wasn't born a poor black child,
but I was born poor,
which made me susceptible to wanting to be rich.
Of course I'm thinking about myself.
What, you wouldn't?
Please, you'd throw a giraffe off of Noah's Ark
just to save your sorry ass.
The world's probably without unicorns
because of one of your ancestors, and I--
Will you just let me finish a thought, for God's sake?
Louis? What exactly are you doing?
Well, what does it look like I'm doing?
I'm having a discussion about the fate of the firm
with my dead secretary's ashes.
Well, as long as it's not something weird.
What exactly have you two been doing the last half hour?
The same thing you're about to do.
No way, I'm not doing the Mary Jane.
Yes, you are.
I'm not huffing and puffing.
Louis, it's the only way.
No, I'm not doing the dirty.
It's okay. I got this.
I mean, if Louis doesn't want to smoke it, maybe Norma does.
Don't you dare.
Relax, Louis.
It's not like it's gonna kill her.
Harvey, that is not funny, okay?
You're gonna get ashes in her ashes.
Then why don't you just smoke it yourself?
Put that out.
Nope.
I'm gonna light this joint on the count of one...
Harvey, I'm telling you.
Two...
Harvey!
Three.
Did you pull your back out?
Give me the goddamn thing.
Jesus Christ.
That's the thing about computers.
You can delete whatever you want,
but it's never really gone.
So, if you had just stopped one trade sooner,
they might never have even caught you.
Yeah, I could've stopped five, four, three trades sooner.
They might not have. But how do you know?
I'll tell you how you know.
You stop when you have enough money
to put your kids through college.
Yeah, but what college?
And what if they want to go to med school?
And what if they need a car?
And then somewhere along the way,
you stop thinking about if they need a car,
and you start thinking, "I need a car."
And that's when you get caught,
because whether you want to admit it to yourself or not,
you were never thinking about them in first place.
And whether you were or weren't,
once you start, you don't stop.
That's one hell of a story, Frank.
Yeah, well, this is prison.
Everyone's got a hell of a story.
Anyway, that's enough for one night.
I'm gonna go to bed.
My story started with my grandmother.
She was sick,
and she needed money...
and I found a way to get it for her.
Holy shit.
This is the best thing ever.
I love the both of you so much.
This is your doing.
Harvey, we're making progress.
Holy shit. This is the best egg roll ever.
Jesus Christ, get me out of here.
This is so awesome.
I mean, I haven't been this stress-free
since I took gold in the Math-lympics
and Esther went to fat camp in the same week.
Esther went to fat camp?
They called it Violin All-Stars,
but we all know what that's code for.
And if you so much as picture her in a school-girl outfit.
Come on, Louis, we're all feeling good.
You telling me you never slipped up
and had an inappropriate relationship?
Louis, I do not want to know the answer to that.
I did.
It was the most shameful night of my life.
Harvey, don't--
What exactly was so shameful about it?
Well, she was a paralegal,
and I took mud with her.
I don't understand.
Are you saying you sullied her reputation?
No, I'm saying I sullied the concept of mud.
What the hell are you talking about?
What, do I need a bullhorn?
I had a premature muddification.
What the hell does that mean?
I think we all know what that means.
It means I couldn't hold my mud.
I still don't know what that means.
Did you take a shit in the mud?
No, that's disgusting.
Well, what part of this conversation isn't disgusting?
I know I'm gonna regret asking this.
Who exactly was it?
I cannot tell you that information.
Okay, good, because the truth is, I don't--
It was Missy Dietler.
Louis, I'm gonna ask you a question.
I want you to tell me the truth.
Does Missy Dietler know you couldn't hold your mud?
Oh, heavens no.
The Turkish silt was thick enough
to prevent her from feeling it, so...
Was it thick enough to hide you wanting to go sleep after?
My God, she knew.
I got news for you, Louis. They always know.
Oh, you're so right.
You're so right.
She--
I need 15 minutes to myself.
And that's it.
I cut a deal, and now I'm here.
Wait a second.
If you're a fake lawyer, they had to give you a chance
to turn on someone to get out of it.
They did.
So why the hell didn't you do it?
Because I wouldn't have been able to live with myself.
Somebody out there owes you a lot.
Yeah, well...
I owe him a lot too.
So, what, you're--
you're like a-a good guy or something?
Am I?
What do you mean?
I left the woman I love at the altar today.
Why'd you do that?
Because I didn't want to chain her to me
if there was even the chance that she would regret it.
Then, yeah, you're a good guy.
Thanks, Frank.
One thing about everyone being gone...
we got the run of the place.
I never knew what the ceiling looked like in here.
It's like "The Breakfast Club."
Do you ever not quote a movie?
No, and you got a problem with that, frankly, my dear,
I don't give a damn.
You're an idiot.
You think Louis is gonna be okay with me now?
I think we're about to find out.
Harvey, what I was saying before...
You don't need to say anything, Louis.
I'm not gonna tell anyone.
That's not what I was gonna say.
It's not the only inappropriate relationship I ever had.
I recorded you saying that you knew about Mike,
and I almost gave it to Anita Gibbs.
Did you know about this?
No.
But I suspected when he tried to get me
to turn you in to Gibbs with him.
And what exactly was your response to that request?
She said we didn't need to do that,
and if it came to it,
you would take the bullet for both of us.
I would have.
I'm sorry, Harvey.
I almost ruined your life.
You don't need to be sorry, Louis.
The truth is, I'm the one that ruined all of our lives,
when I hired Mike.
And I never apologized to either one of you for it,
but I will now.
I'm sorry.
So...
we good?
We're good.
All right, now that the two of you have made peace,
let's figure out how we're gonna win this war,
which starts with knowing how much we have in our war chest.
What exactly does that mean?
It means it's time
to answer the question that she asked two hours ago.
How much money do we have?
This again?
Louis, after everything we've been through tonight,
how hard could it be for us to write down
how much we're worth right now?
I need another 15 minutes to myself.
Again?
Aw, Harvey, let him go.
He probably doesn't have as much as we do,
and it's a vulnerable thing for him.
"Vulnerable"?
He just told us he jerked off in the mud an hour ago.
You don't think he's gonna do that right now, do you?
Based on what he told us,
he doesn't need 15 minutes for that.
You want to call her?
What?
Your fiancée, you want to call her?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about my first night in here.
I remember thinking what I wouldn't give
to let Jennifer know I was okay.
The thing is, I couldn't, but you can.
I thought we weren't allowed to have phones in here.
Yeah, well, I wasn't allowed to make inside trades either.
But I did, and now I'm in here.
What else are they gonna do?
Uh, thanks, but...
I just...
I just can't right now.
Whenever you want, phone's right here.
Let's try to get some shut-eye, man.
You okay?
He's everywhere.
He's all around here, Donna.
The first place we met was down the hallway.
And the first time we kissed was in the library.
And I met his grandmother 50 feet from here.
And right here, he told me the truth.
Rachel--
He was standing
right where you are, and I was upset with him
about something that I don't even remember.
And then he told me that he had lost everyone in his life,
and then he told me he was a fraud.
And then we... Mm.
You're gonna get through this.
I know.
I just wish I could see him.
What do you mean? You can see him.
No, I can't. I called the prison.
You called the prison tonight?
Yes, because I wanted to know if he was okay.
And they...
they wouldn't give me any information.
So then I asked them about visitation,
and they said that I had to wait,
and I had to get on a list, and--
How long?
At least a month.
I don't know what to say.
You always know what to say.
Not this time.
Excuse me, ladies.
Sorry to interrupt, but I think we might have a problem.
What is it, Benjamin?
We're being hacked.
Oh, that's a tidy little sum you got there.
You're not doing so bad yourself.
No, I am not.
Not bad for two people that came from nothing.
I didn't come from nothing, and you know it.
Bet it still feels pretty good to write that number down.
Oh, it sure does.
You're still a little high, aren't you?
I sure am.
There. You wanted you wanted to know my net worth.
You got it.
Holy shit.
Who are you?
Are you a king?
No, I'm just not an idiot.
What the hell have you been doing with your money?
Louis, we're not exactly poor.
That's what Bolivia says to the U.S.,
but if NATO goes to war, they're not kicking in dick.
Well, if you're so damn rich, why didn't you pony up
for Donna's salary when you had the chance?
Do you even know how to spell "Fiscal responsibility"?
I know how to spell "Cheap."
All right, that's enough.
At least now we know
we have enough to fund ourselves for a while.
You guys have two rich uncles?
'Cause I'm not carrying your asses if this thing drags out.
Louis, this is a team effort, and I swear to God,
if you don't come through on this--
I hate to interrupt your "Breakfast Club" Moment,
but you need to sober up.
Donna, what is it?
According to Benjamin,
the partners didn't just leave.
They're coming after every client we have.
All right, give me an update
and give it to me in plain English.
I was able to shut the hack down,
but not before they got all three of your clients' files.
Shit, they're trying to put us in the ground tonight.
Then we have to stop it before it even gets started.
Well, the only problem with that
is that we don't know what bullshit story
they're out there selling right now.
Then we need to figure it out. We need to figure it out fast.
It's the main line.
What should we do?
Donna.
Pearson Specter Litt, may I help you?
One moment, please.
It's for you. It's Jim Reynolds.
That's Decker Pharmaceutical. Don't take it. He's leaving us.
Louis, he's my oldest client.
I'm not ducking his call.
Jessica.
Put him on speaker.
Jim, how can I help you?
You can tell me what's going on there.
I've been hearing a lot of rumors,
and I need to hear the truth from you.
All right, Jim, you want to hear the truth?
We went out for the afternoon, and when we got back,
every partner in the place was gone.
But I'm telling you,
the name partners are still here,
and we can still service you and the board.
I know you can.
Then you're not calling to say that you're leaving us?
I was calling to tell you I've been sent notice.
They're bifurcating your firm,
and the other partners have nothing to do
with Pearson Specter Litt anymore.
Thanks, Jim. I appreciate it, and I won't forget it.
Jessica, if you're not back on your feet
by the end of the month,
I won't be able to hold off the board.
If we're not back by the end of the month,
I will call the board and resign from service myself.
Isn't this good? They're not trying to poach.
It's just as bad.
What do you mean?
It means they don't care about clients right now.
They're bifurcating the firm
because they want their buy-ins back.
And they hacked us to get our clients' information
so that they could deliver notice.
We need to move the money that we have
in every account by tomorrow.
We don't need to move it. We need to use it.
If you're thinking what I think you're thinking,
you're a genius.
What are you talking about?
We can use their buy-ins
to settle the class-action lawsuits.
And they won't be able to sue us for the money back
because it'll already be gone.
You really are a genius.
Thanks, Harvey.
Uh, might I point out that I was the one
that brought the hacking to your attention
in the first place, so...
You might as well tell me what's on your mind.
I can hear you staring at the wall
from all the way over here.
How do you handle it...
Being away from Jennifer for so long?
Trust each other, visit each other,
and don't ask questions you don't want answers to.
That doesn't sound like fun.
Yeah, well, it shouldn't be that hard for you.
You're only here for two years.
I'm here for five more.
Jesus.
You're telling me.
You know, maybe I'll just send Rachel a text...
you know, let her know that I'm okay.
Sure thing, kid.
Just give it back when you're done.
Well, now that we're starting fresh,
can we please finally get rid of that hideous duck painting?
No, Louis, we can't.
Why not?
Because it's like you.
I can't stand it, but it's part of the family.
Speaking of family, where's Gretchen?
I can't believe she would walk out on us too.
She didn't. We were supposed to be at the wedding,
so I gave her the day off to go to the orthodontist.
Orthodontist?
Yeah, the woman's in her 60s.
She still wears a retainer.
All right, we have a game plan.
Tomorrow morning, we offer them
ten cents on the dollar to settle these suits.
And from this point on,
we are all committing to giving this firm
every ounce of blood, sweat, and tears we have.
What is it?
I just got a text from Mike.
What does it say?
It says that he's settling in
and that he's getting along well with his roommate...
And that he thinks he's gonna be okay.
Maybe he's gonna be okay,
but his roommate's in for trouble.
To trouble.
To trouble.
What?
She texted you back.
What did she say?
She says she got your text, she misses you,
And she's glad you get along with your roomate.
Thanks, Frank.
For everthing.
All right, let's go.
Come on, you got to get out before next shift.
They can't know I let you switch.
Wait, switch what?
I'm in the right cell. I'm in the one you gave me.
Yeah, but this isn't the one they gave me.
What?
You're in the right cell. I'm not.
What the hell are you talking about?
Only thing I told you tonight that's true
is that you shouldn't trust people in here.
But you did. Now I know all about you.
Why the hell would you do that to me?
You said you could've turned on a guy to get out of here
but you didn't because you owe him.
Well, I owe that son of bitch too.
Harvey.
Yeah, Harvy Specter.
Put me away 13 years ago.
I've been dreaming about getting him back ever since.
Then I read about you in the paper.
I realized that
I could get back at him without leaving these walls.
You son of bitch.
Get it easy, Mike.
You remember I know about you.
And I get your little girlfriend's number right here.
