what &apos;s the most irritating thing my parents say to me ?
&quot; that &apos;s too much cologne . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s how girls end up dead . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t talk black to me . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s inappropriate because she &apos;s your teacher . &quot;
how do you even talk black ?
end words with &quot; izzle &quot; ?
it &apos;s &quot; talk back , &quot; you idiot .
&quot; act more like an adult . &quot;
what does &quot; act more like an adult &quot; even mean ?
look at you , you &apos;re soaked ! that is so lame .
you &apos;re the one who wanted to do it !
what are you two doing ?
oh , i picked up one of those water weasels .
you hook it on the end
of the hose and it flies around in the air .
just like a weasel .
yeah . look at how awesome . he &apos;s so wet .
i put the weasel in my pants .
he totally did .
dork !
is there a reason why my window &apos;s wet ?
hmm . very difficult to say .
i don &apos;t know .
up top- ow ! ow !
what &apos;s wrong ?
little-
sweetie , you okay ?
little twinge . yeah .
i &apos;ll call 911 .
maybe the firemen will come .
no , no ! no , no !
give me it !
the firemen in our town have a reputation for being hot .
do i resent that ?
of course not . these guys are my friends .
i play basketball with them . i bake for &apos; em .
my question is : what &apos;s hot ?
come on ! let &apos;s go ! let &apos;s go !
coming .
manny , it &apos;s inappropriate because it &apos;s your teacher .
what &apos;s the big deal anyway ?
it &apos;s a surprise . you &apos;ll see .
oh , my god !
ay , jay , you didn &apos;t ?
yes , i did .
i got us into that new benihana .
they got a chef there that can flip a shrimp into his own hat .
what the hell ?
dad !
there &apos;s my boy !
the hell is he doing here ?
jay .
no . he was supposed to pick up manny yesterday
and disappointed him again , as usual .
now he just sails in here out of the blue ?
i don &apos;t like the guy . do i have reasons ? yeah .
good reasons ? yeah .
how many reasons do i need ?
none . i don &apos;t like the guy .
第一季第十一集
so i would have called ,
but while i was buying this boat for a friend ,
i got chased out to sea by another boat &quot; tiqui tiqui . &quot;
were they pirates ?
i didn &apos;t stop to ask .
well , it &apos;s not hard to tell .
did they have curvy swords and
sing songs about how fun it is to be a pirate ?
jay . such a beautiful house , huh ?
so , we were just headed out to dinner .
what , you think i show up empty @-@ handed ?
i brought dinner- lobsters !
did you catch them with your bare hands ?
no .
but i bought them with my bare hands .
and i have some nice wine , a good cuban cigar for jay .
hey , why don &apos;t you take a picture of him with your new camera phone .
i don &apos;t have a camera phone .
you do now .
awesome !
all of this excitement , my heart is just going .
now , listen to me .
you bring that with you when you come visit me this summer .
we &apos;ll go in a race car with my friend ,
and after that , maybe a bullfight .
i know all these guys .
the matadors , they &apos;re like artists .
you &apos;re quite the bullfight artist yourself .
i , uh- manny , why don &apos;t you show your father to the kitchen ?
por favor . dios mo . someone put on some music .
tonight , we dance !
oh , we &apos;re gonna dance .
oye , mi amor , est bien que me quede aqu esta noche ?
ay , javier , yo no s . esprate para ver qu puedo hacer .
what did he say ? does he need money for the lobsters ?
jay , be nice .
&quot; be nice . &quot;
i could be sitting grill @-@ side ,
watching a guy build an onion volcano .
instead , i got rico suave in my kitchen ,
and i got a stolen boat in my driveway .
if it was for me , he &apos;d be out of my life .
but it &apos;s good for manny to be with his father .
i just can &apos;t believe you ever fell for that act .
colombians can be very persuasive .
they can make you agree to things before you even know it .
you must have been pretty naive .
yeah . but now i &apos;m with the right man , okay ?
right .
javier is only going to stay one night .
good .
wait , what ?
don &apos;t be mad . i just got up to change her .
well , mitchell really wanted to ferberize the baby .
ferberize . it is a method of
getting the baby to sleep through the night ...
by , yes , basically letting her cry herself to sleep .
torture .
it &apos;s not torture , cam .
it &apos;s just hard if you happen to be a person
who hates to hear another person suffer .
or two people suffer .
no , no . you got up to comfort her ,
which only teaches her that every time she cries ,
her daddy will come in and cuddle her and put on her favorite-
what are we watching ?
brian de palma &apos;s controversial masterpiece
scarface .
for the baby ?
she happens to like it .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s the colors or the sounds-
oh , here comes the nightclub massacre . she loves it .
watch her little eyelids .
it &apos;s so cute . they get so heavy .
oh , that &apos;s bad .
oh , honey .
i &apos;m fine . no , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m just- okay , that &apos;s cancer .
maybe it &apos;s just a kidney stone .
&quot; just , &quot; claire ?
what &apos;s going on , guys ?
it &apos;s nothing . go back to bed .
no , but dad ...
don &apos;t touch me .
i bet it &apos;s just a kidney stone .
&quot; just &quot; again .
someone get your mom a glass of water ...
and a piece of gravel from the driveway and see how she likes it .
why is everybody yelling ?
something &apos;s wrong with dad .
don &apos;t frighten him . come here .
oh , that &apos;s gotta be death ! death is coming !
okay , you need to go to the hospital .
yeah .
no , no , no . i just need a pill .
give me the biggest one you can find .
honey , breathe . just @-@ just breathe .
that &apos;s what i told you when youwere in labor
and you threw my smoothie at me . pill !
okay , i &apos;m calling .
no , no , it &apos;s fine !
it &apos;s actually- it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s passing . it &apos;s passing .
i am sorry to alarm everyone .
i think i was probably just overreacting ,
because there &apos;s an alien inside of me !
oh , my god .
oh , close it down .
i am definitely gonna call .
all systems down . all systems down .
son of a bitch .
what &apos;s the matter ?
he &apos;s playing on my pool table , that &apos;s what .
probably got himself a nice drink too .
where you going , jay ?
just to check things out , okay ?
come on .
you hear that ? now he &apos;s messing around with my remote control .
you can &apos;t hear that from here !
hey , there .
hey , jay . listen , i &apos;m sorry . did i wake you up ?
no . no , i &apos;m a light sleeper .
that &apos;s what happens when you get older .
oh , you &apos;re not old .
i didn &apos;t say i was old .
i never sleep much anyway .
life is just more interesting after 2 : 00 a.m.
you know , the liquor tastes better ,
the , uh , women are more beautiful .
what is it they say ?
that the night belongs to the poets and the madmen .
which are you ?
perhaps both .
and i think maybe you too , huh ?
i see a picture over here of you on a motorcycle .
you ride ?
i used to .
used to ? used to ?
jay ,
the saddest words in any language , my friend .
hey , help me out here .
everybody sees you as this great guy .
you know , you live this life of adventure .
how come i don &apos;t buy a word of it ?
all i see is a dad who doesn &apos;t show up .
hey , manny knows me . i live in the now .
well , i was living in the yesterday
when manny was crying outside that door ...
cause you didn &apos;t show up for the 10th time .
and when i don &apos;t come , you think ,
uh- what , i &apos;m just off chasing a good time , hmm ?
you ever think it might be hard for me , coming here ?
why ? because of gloria ?
because of you .
cam !
okay , they &apos;re on their way .
okay , kids , gather around .
like you &apos;re hugging me , but don &apos;t touch me , okay ?
now look , i &apos;m gonna be fine .
we know , dad .
we don &apos;t know that .
it &apos;s a miracle i &apos;m standing up .
but look , in case anything happens-
i want you to know that if i &apos;d had time ,
i would have fixed that step .
thanks , dad .
i love you .
don &apos;t cry , luke . i &apos;m okay .
i broke the coffee table !
that &apos;s okay .
what ?
i broke the glass coffee table .
the one you swore you didn &apos;t break ,
and then we blamed esperanza and fired her ...
and she stole a turkey at thanksgiving for her family
and got deported ?
yeah .
damn it !
i &apos;m sorry .
you will be sorry !
they &apos;re here !
really ?
did you hear that ?
luke broke the-
hey , you changed your clothes .
well , i had- i had to get dressed .
into that sexy , clingy-
oh , my god . it &apos;s the firemen .
no , sweetie .
and lipstick !
i &apos;m out here convulsing in agony
and you &apos;re looking for cute tops to wear ?
i just threw on the first thing i could find .
we got a minute , if you wanna try on some tighter jeans-
oh , phil , sweetie .
oh , no . by all means , claire ,
we want you looking your sexiest ...
when the hunky , gay firemen get here !
how we doing ?
we &apos;re great .
he meant me !
all right .
cameron !
no , listen , jay . you &apos;re a tough guy to compete with .
i mean , look at all you have .
so manny has to suffer ?
no . you &apos;re right .
look , i &apos;m going to try harder .
but maybe it &apos;s a good thing that he has the two of us .
from you , he learns stability .
from me , he learns how to be spontaneous ,
grab life by the throat .
well , we do a little throat grabbing ourselves around here , you know .
we were on our way to benihana when you showed up .
hey , as long as my boy follows his passion .
the worst career decision i ever made
was playing baseball , but i loved every minute of it .
you played baseball ?
i lived baseball .
i only made it to triple @-@ a ,
but i played with all those guys- sosa , mcgwire .
you look like you played some .
i played in high school .
i was all right . never hit a curve ball .
so that &apos;s a dream of yours ?
to- to hit a curve ?
used to be .
&quot; used to be . &quot; por favor .
i said that again , right ?
hey , please . come on .
you &apos;re right , i shouldn &apos;t say that .
what are you guys doing ?
manny , did we wake you up ? i &apos;m sorry .
no . i was doing my science extra credit .
of course you were .
so , can i play ?
that &apos;s up to your dad .
actually , i think we &apos;re done with pool for right now .
i have a better idea for the three of us . vamos .
so , how do you know this guy ?
he owes me a little favor .
this is the coolest night ever !
now , let &apos;s see about that curve ball .
out .
i thought you were-
those were pillows . come on . come on .
cameron , do you realize how infuriating this is ?
the whole point of ferberizing ...
is to teach her to put herself to sleep ,
and you keep ruining it .
i can &apos;t help it . i &apos;m like a mother bear .
when i hear my cub crying , i have to run to her .
except you &apos;re not a bear . get in our room .
get- cam , get in there . get in there .
cut it out .
all the way- our room .
get ! get in there .
come on . come on . get in there . get !
that &apos;s so unfair . why not ?
because that &apos;s how girls end up dead .
hey , honey .
hey , guys .
we just wanted to see how you &apos;re doing .
is this a bad time ?
no , we &apos;re just giving him something to relax before the procedure .
which is gonna go just fine .
oh , we know .
we don &apos;t know .
in case it doesn &apos;t ,
promise me you &apos;ll be nice to your new fireman daddy .
unbelievable .
my wife got dressed up for the firemen last night .
i didn &apos;t get dressed up for the firemen .
those heels were really hot .
you put on heels ?
let &apos;s drop it .
what are they doing to you , dad ?
i have a little scratchy rock inside of me
and they &apos;re sliding in a tube and sucking it out .
you &apos;re not scared , are you ?
when was the last time you saw your old man scared ?
when you walked through the spiderweb .
when we were playing with the ouija board
and the wind blew the door shut .
there was no wind , buddy . we brought something forth .
oh . this stuff &apos;s really hitting me .
my insides feel like velvet .
why don &apos;t you guys wait out in the hallway , okay ?
feel better , dad .
i will .
love you , dad .
love you .
love you .
luke , buddy , hold back a sec .
this is not gonna happen , okay ,
but there is a scenario
where you could be the man of the house ...
and you need to know all the pin numbers and passwords .
741
i don &apos;t wanna be the man of the house .
now , don &apos;t talk black to me .
honey , your dad &apos;s gonna be fine .
why don &apos;t you wait out in the hall . he &apos;ll be fine , okay ?
honey , i &apos;m just gonna run them to school .
i &apos;ll be back right after .
okay . claire ?
yeah .
you did get dressed up , didn &apos;t you ?
i pulled on the first thing i saw , okay ?
okay , i &apos;ll drop it
&apos;cause this stuff is making me fall asleep .
and if i never wake up , i &apos;d hate
for the last thing you ever said to me to be a lie .
i might have gotten dressed up just a tiny bit .
i knew it .
oh , damn it !
manny , we &apos;re gonna be late for school .
why are you so tired today ?
any reason i can &apos;t take him ?
i &apos;m surprised you &apos;re up .
i know what time you went back to bed .
oh , it was nothing . we just went out , we hit a few balls .
and you &apos;ll never guess where .
i guess javier knew a guy .
and you know what ?
now that he knows you ,
the next time he needs something , you are the guy .
ay , dios mo . did you took him with you ?
you couldn &apos;t wait to get to school to do that ?
manny , vamonos para el colegio .
let &apos;s go . we &apos;re gonna be so late . vamonos .
vamos a llegar tardsimo , manny ,
qu te pasa ? get in the car .
i thought you said you wanted me to bond with javier .
i said be nice , jay .
i didn &apos;t say take manny up all night and play games .
then we got hot dogs .
ay . go to sleep !
if i wanted to be married to a wild man ,
i would have stayed with javier .
qu pasa ?
dad !
por dios , no .
what the hell ?
wait a minute .
you &apos;re not leaving , are you ?
i &apos;ve got school .
what ? school ?
yes , school .
that &apos;s where people go to learn things ,
like not to keep children up all night .
he told her ?
he &apos;s weak .
well , listen , you said you used to like riding motorcycles , right ?
so i brought you one .
i know . but i kind of got work .
work .
go , jay .
yeah , go .
yes , go , jay , and take manny with you too !
okay .
no , manuel alberto !
in the car or i put you in the trunk !
jay , i &apos;m not gonna argue anymore .
i &apos;m not gonna say anything else . do whatever you want .
but i don &apos;t wanna hear you any more saying that colombians are crazy ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re the one that is acting crazy ,
even though he &apos;s the one that is making you act crazy .
so i don &apos;t know what the hell i &apos;m talking about ! manny !
you didn &apos;t need to come home during nap time .
think we proved last night that i did .
well , she &apos;s back there now , so why don &apos;t you go ,
so you don &apos;t get in trouble .
that &apos;s okay . i told everyone
that i have an unreliable partner ,
and , uh , they understood .
you know what ? i don &apos;t need to sit here and be condescended to .
i &apos;m gonna make myself an ice tea .
i will bring you down .
you can &apos;t bring me down .
i &apos;ll sweep your legs .
there &apos;s something wrong with you ...
that the sound of our child in such distress
doesn &apos;t bother you more .
she &apos;s not in distress ,
and this just proves that you need this more than she does .
i &apos;m ferberizing two babies .
raccoons slipped into the lawsons &apos; home
and stole a loaf of bread .
your point ?
that we left lily &apos;s window open a crack ,
and those raccoons need something to put between that bread ,
and that is lily &apos;s &quot; help me &quot; cry .
i &apos;m coming for you , lily .
no , you &apos;re not .
you are not coming , cameron .
let me go ! hey , stop it !
let go ! get off me ! what are you doing ?
stop !
i will not stop .
stop being such a baby . i &apos;m coming for you !
what ?
oh , my ankle .
my ankle .
ay ! i guess you didn &apos;t kill yourself in the motorcycle today .
well , i figured you were looking forward to killing me ,
so i &apos;m not gonna take that away from you .
hey , did javier call you ?
no , why ?
he &apos;s dragging me to this bar with some of his old baseball pals .
he was supposed to be here at 5 : 00 .
ah , he &apos;s dragging you , huh ?
yeah .
i figured it would be okay .
i &apos;ve seen half these guys play .
javier says it &apos;s cool .
what ? what &apos;s the joke ?
nothing .
it &apos;s just funny to me ... that you make fun of me
because i was seduced by him ,
but here you are-
no one is getting seduced .
i &apos;m doing this for manny .
yeah , it &apos;s very important for manny
that you two go and have a nice picnic in the mountains .
first of all , it wasn &apos;t a picnic . we stopped for coffee .
they just happened to be selling crepes .
listen . let me know when he calls , all right ?
geez , it &apos;s almost 6 : 00 .
the kids are so excited for you to come home .
oh , me too .
yeah , luke made you a sign .
oh , he &apos;s a sweetie .
yeah . you seem great .
i am great .
good .
except for that fireman thing .
you remember it ?
mm @-@ hmm .
yeah , okay . look , i am sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
ah , no .
there &apos;s no excuse for it .
i think i just spend so much time in dowdy mom clothes ,
and i &apos;m covered in paste and peanut butter ,
and i just- i wanted to feel attractive for a second , you know ?
i &apos;m sorry . i really-
honey , i just need a little bit of time .
gonna be fine .
okay .
yeah .
okay .
i was already fine with it .
here &apos;s the deal : claire messed up .
she owed me .
this never happens .
old phil has a golden ticket .
now , i could have cashed that in right away for something small-
get out of cleaning the garage , a week at circus camp .
still fresh .
yeah .
but the longer you hold on to it , the more the guilt builds ,
the more you get .
five years : trip to paris with my buddies .
ten years : sweet little convertible .
twenty years :
hello , fully articulating , five @-@ function robot ...
that can read my mind and has feelings .
phil , you &apos;re not leaving without saying good @-@ bye , are you ?
hey , elaine .
is this your husband ?
uh @-@ huh .
good @-@ bye , paris .
i &apos;m visiting my sister ...
and he was entertaining us all afternoon with his card tricks .
is that phil ?
hey .
hey , mom , phil &apos;s leaving .
without a hug ?
wow .
good @-@ bye , fully articulating ,
five @-@ function robot with the ability to- good @-@ bye .
brittany , hurry , honey . phil &apos;s leaving .
you &apos;re fine .
how &apos;s your ankle ?
it &apos;s cold .
i &apos;m sorry i hurt you .
no . no , don &apos;t be . i-
i could have just as easily hurt you .
well , it &apos;s cute that you think that .
listen , cam , i- i can &apos;t always be the bad cop here .
i @-@ i know it &apos;s my issue ,
but she can &apos;t grow up with
one huggy , happy , cuddly dad ...
and one frowny , lesson @-@ teachy dad .
because guess which one
she &apos;s gonna ask to walk her down the aisle .
uh- y- okay , you know what ?
i can be the bad cop sometimes .
i &apos;ll always make her eat her vegetables .
okay . dentist .
deal .
good .
as long as you make her practice her violin .
oh , yeah . the violin . i like that .
and we &apos;re both walking her down the aisle .
assuming you can walk by then .
do you need to go to the hospital for that ?
no , god . no , no . it &apos;s not that bad .
oh , you meant call 911 , didn &apos;t you ?
firemen .
yeah , you call , and i &apos;m gonna change my shirt .
so , if i &apos;m supposed to act like an adult ,
is that act like adults i see in the world-
or the adults in my family ?
&apos;cause if it &apos;s the ones in my family-
come on . let &apos;s go .
all right .
then ...
how hard could that be ?
doing the card tricks at the hospital
really got me fired up about my magic again .
is this your card ?
yes . oh , my gosh .
it &apos;s- it &apos;s not , is it ?
no , uh , no . it &apos;s not .
the hardest part is when people forget their card ,
because then i look like the idiot .
all right . let &apos;s do it again .
we really have to go .
you think i like this ?
i &apos;m sorry .
here . i &apos;m gonna teach you one , okay ?
on the count of three , just grab this . you ready ?
put your hand out .
okay .
one , two , three . there it is .
no . what was that ?
thank you .
are you kidding me ?
