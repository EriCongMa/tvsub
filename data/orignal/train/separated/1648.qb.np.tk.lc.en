here &apos;s the problem with teleportation .
lay it on me .
assuming a device could be invented
which would identify the quantum state of matter
of an individual in one location
and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly ,
you would not have actually transported the individual .
you would have destroyed him in one location
and recreated him in another .
how about that .
personally , i would never use a transporter ,
because the original sheldon would have to be
disintegrated in order to create a new sheldon .
would the new sheldon be in any way
an improvement on the old sheldon ?
no , he would be exactly the same .
that is a problem .
so you see it too .
dr. hofstadter .
dr. cooper .
dr. gablehauser. dr. gablehauser .
gentlemen , i &apos;d like you to meet dennis kim .
dennis is a highly sought @-@ after doctoral candidate ,
and we &apos;re hopingto have him do his graduate work here .
graduate work. very impressive .
and he &apos;s only 15 years old .
not bad-- i , myself , started graduate school at 14 .
well , i lost a year while my family
was tunneling out of north korea .
advantage kim .
i thought maybe you boys
could show dennis around .
let him see why we &apos;re
the best physics research facility in the country .
i already know you &apos;re not .
you don &apos;t have an open science grid computer
or a free electron laser , and the string theory research
being done here is nothing but a dead end .
excuse me , that is my research ,
and it is by no means a dead end .
well , obviously you don &apos;t see it yet ,
but trust me , you will .
dennis , we &apos;ve discussed this .
we &apos;re in the process of updating our equipment ,
and we welcome your input on our research goals ,
and we &apos;ve agreed to look the other way if you want
to use up to 20 % of the grant money you attract
to smuggle your grandfather out of pyongyang .
we want him here , boys .
make it happen .
yes , sir .
you can count on us .
we &apos;re on it .
what the hell do you mean , &quot; dead end &quot; ?
i mean , the whole landscape of false vacuums
in string theory could be as large as ten
to the five hundredth power .
in addition-- ooh , look , chocolate milk .
i sense a disturbance in the force .
a bad feeling i have about this .
so , dennis , how long have you been in america ?
a year and a half .
no kidding .
you speak english really well .
so do you .
except for your tendency to end
sentences with prepositions .
what are you talking about ?
that .
he &apos;s not wrong .
all right ...
and this is my office .
is this part of the tour ?
nope. good @-@ bye .
come on , sheldon , we &apos;ve hardly shown him anything .
all right .
this is my desk .
these are my books ; this is my door .
please close it behind you. good @-@ bye .
looks like you &apos;re doing work
in quantum loop corrections .
keen observation .
good @-@ bye .
you see where you went wrong , don &apos;t you ?
leonard ?
yeah ?
get him out .
come on , dennis .
i &apos;ll show you the recreation center .
they &apos;ve got nautilus equipment .
do i look like i lift weights ?
not heavy ones .
it &apos;s startling to me you haven &apos;t considered
a lorentz invariant or field theory approach .
you think i haven &apos;t considered it ?
you really think i haven &apos;t considered it ?
have you considered it ?
get him out , leonard .
come on , dennis .
i &apos;ll show you the radiation lab .
wow , you won the stevenson award ?
yes .
in fact , i am the youngest person ever to win it .
really ? how old ?
fourteen and a half .
hm , you were the youngest person ever to win it .
it &apos;s like looking into an obnoxious
little mirror , isn &apos;t it ?
this is really delicious , isn &apos;t it ?
still can &apos;t talk to me unless you &apos;re drunk , huh ?
oh , sweetie , you are so damaged .
hey , i &apos;m damaged , too .
how about a hug for howie ?
sure. raj , hug howard .
something you &apos;d like to share ?
a tale of woe , perhaps ?
fifteen years old .
dennis kim &apos;s 15 years old , and he &apos;s already correcting my work .
today , i went from being wolfgang amadeus mozart , to ...
you know , that other guy .
antonio salieri ?
oh god , now even you &apos;re smarter than me .
you know , sheldon , you don &apos;t have
so many friends that you can afford
to start insulting them .
just eat , sheldon , you &apos;ll feel better .
why waste food ?
in texas , when a cow goes dry ,
they don &apos;t keep feeding it , they just take her out
and shoot her between the eyes .
i &apos;m confused .
did sheldon stop giving milk ?
you can &apos;t let this kid get to you .
you always knew that someday someone would come along
who was younger and smarter .
yes , but i assumed i would &apos;ve been dead
hundreds of years and that there &apos;d be
an asterisk by his name because he &apos;d be a cyborg .
so you &apos;ve got a little competition .
i really don &apos;t see what the big deal is .
well , of course you don &apos;t .
you &apos;ve never excelled at anything .
i don &apos;t understand-- exactly how
did he get any friends in the first place ?
we liked leonard .
well , what are you gonna do , sheldon , just give up ?
yes .
it &apos;s what a rational person does
when his entire life &apos;s work is invalidated
by a postpubescent asian wunderkind .
he ceases his fruitless efforts ,
he donates his body to scientific research ,
and he waits to die .
you know , i &apos;m confused again .
is he waiting , or do we get
to shoot him between the eyes ?
i &apos;ve decided you &apos;re right .
my career is not over .
great !
but since the arrival of dennis kim
has rendered my research pointless ,
i just have to find something else to focus on .
great !
so i &apos;ve decided i &apos;m going to collaborate with you .
great .
so what exactly is it you do ?
i know you chatter on about it all the time ,
but i &apos;ve never really paid attention .
okay , well , right now i &apos;m designing an experiment
to study the soft component of cosmic radiation
at sea level , but i really don &apos;t need any help .
oh , sure you do .
now , see , what &apos;s this here in the schematic ?
is that a laser array ?
yes. now , hm ...
what happens if you use argon lasers
instead of helium @-@ neon ?
it would blow up .
are you sure ? pretty sure .
&quot; pretty sure &quot; is not very scientific .
is this how you normally work ?
just hunches and guesses and stuff ?
okay , sheldon , i understand that you &apos;re
going through a bit of a career crisis ,
you &apos;re searching for some other area
where you can feel valuable and productive ,
but i need to tell you something ,
and i want you to listen carefully .
all right .
go away .
if you &apos;re concerned about sharing credit with me ,
your name can go first-- i &apos;m going .
it &apos;s a small , brown paper bag , ma !
i &apos;m looking in it right now .
why would i make that up ?
there &apos;s no ding dong in it .
how are two ding dongs tomorrow gonna help me today ?
so ...
this is engineering , huh ?
i &apos;ll talk to you later .
engineering .
where the noble semiskilled laborers
execute the vision of those who think and dream .
hello , oompah loompahs of science .
sheldon , what are you doing here ?
i just came by to say hello .
i &apos;ve been in this lab for three years .
you &apos;ve never come by to say hello .
well , up until now , i &apos;ve had better things to do .
so , what are we making today ?
a small payload support structure
for a european science experimental package
that &apos;s going up on the next space shuttle .
really ? how does it work ?
when this is done , it will be attached
to the payload bay , and the sensor apparatus
will rest on it .
so it &apos;s a shelf .
no , you don &apos;t understand-- during acceleration ,
it needs to stay perfectly level and provide ...
yeah , okay , it &apos;s a shelf .
now , i notice you &apos;re using titanium .
did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes ?
they &apos;re lighter , cheaper , and have twice the tensile strength .
sheldon ,
there &apos;s a diploma in my office
that says i have a master &apos;s in engineering .
and you also have a note from your mother
that says , &quot; i love you , bubula . &quot;
but neither of those is a cogent argument
for titanium over nanotubes .
sheldon ? yes ?
go away !
did leonard tell you to say that ?
no , i thought of it all by myself .
that can &apos;t be a coincidence .
there must be some causal link i &apos;m missing .
go away !
curiouser and curiouser .
is he here ?
if he were , i wouldn &apos;t be .
do you know what he did ?
he watched me work for ten minutes ,
and then started to design a simple piece
of software that could replace me .
is that even possible ?
as it turns out , yes .
something &apos;s got to be done about him , leonard .
like what ?
he &apos;ll never be able to cope with the fact
that some 15 @-@ year @-@ old kid is smarter
and more accomplished than he is .
well , what if something were to happen to this boy
so he was no longer a threat to sheldon ?
then our problem would be solved .
hang on , are we talking about murdering dennis kim ?
i &apos;m not saying no .
we don &apos;t have to go that far .
there are other means available .
we can &apos;t send him back to north korea .
he knows how to get out .
the only thing we need to do
is make this kim kid lose his focus .
won &apos;t happen .
he is not interested in anything but physics .
what about biology ?
what ? you know , biology .
the one thing that can completely derail
a world @-@ class mind .
howard , he &apos;s 15 .
yeah , so ?
when i was 15 , i met denise palmeri
and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8 .
she was sleeping with you ?
no , i just wasted a lot of time
thinking about what it would be like if she did .
oh , good , you &apos;re all here .
look , i &apos;ve decided that if the three of you
drop whatever it is you &apos;re working on and join me ,
we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade .
12 years , tops .
go away ?
could it be me ?
oh , hey guys , what &apos;s up ?
we need a hot 15 @-@ year @-@ old asian girl
with a thing for smart guys .
what ?
howard , that &apos;s racist .
any 15 @-@ year @-@ old girl will do the trick .
it &apos;s possible she may have misunderstood us .
dr. cooper .
oh , are we interrupting ?
no , no. please come in .
yeah , i think you &apos;ll appreciate this .
this is very exciting .
oh , what are you working on ?
something remarkable .
since my prospects for the nobel prize in physics
have disappeared--
thank you very much-- i &apos;ve decided
to refocus my efforts and use my people skills
to win the nobel peace prize .
look .
i &apos;m going to solve the middle east crisis
by building an exact replica of jerusalem
in the middle of the mexican desert .
to what end ?
you know , it &apos;s like the baseball movie .
&quot; build it and they will come . &quot;
who will come ?
the jewish people .
what if they don &apos;t come ?
we &apos;ll make it nice , put out a spread .
okay , well , um ...
speaking of spreads ,
we &apos;re having a small welcoming party
this afternoon for mr. kim who &apos;s agreed
to join us here at the university .
of course he has .
the oracle told us
little neo was the one .
you can see the matrix , can &apos;t you ?
okay , well , obviously you &apos;re very busy
with your , uh , um ...
come , dennis .
you &apos;ll have to excuse dr. cooper .
he &apos;s been under a lot of , um ...
he &apos;s nuts .
i really don &apos;t understand
your objections , professor goldfarb .
why wouldn &apos;t the sonora desert
make a perfectly good promised land ?
go away .
we could call it nuevo jerusalem .
please go away .
said pharaoh to moses .
why are all these young women here ?
it &apos;s take your daughter to work day .
really ?
i was not aware of that .
oh , yes. there was a very official e @-@ mail
that was sent to everyone
whose insurance files indicated
they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16 .
smooth. thank you .
there &apos;s the man of the hour .
okay , so we now have a socially @-@ awkward genius
in a room full of attractive , age @-@ appropriate women .
all he has to do now is hook up with one of them .
anyone else see the flaw in this plan ?
we need a social catalyst .
like what ?
we can &apos;t get 15 @-@ year @-@ old girls drunk .
or can we ?
no , we can &apos;t .
i don &apos;t think you mean &quot; we can &apos;t . &quot;
i think you mean &quot; we shouldn &apos;t . &quot;
hey , howard , you &apos;re a jew .
if there was another wailing wall
exactly like the one in jerusalem
but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs ,
would you still be able to wail at it ?
okay , it &apos;s definitely me .
okay , we cannot leave this to chance .
let &apos;s pick a girl and figure out
how to get her together with dennis .
okay , how about that one ?
uh @-@ uh . i know the type .
cheerleader , student council , goes out with the jocks ,
won &apos;t even look at anybody in the gifted program .
and if , after two years of begging ,
she does agree to go out with you ,
it turns out to be a setup and you &apos;re in the backseat
of your mom &apos;s car with your pants off
while the whole football team laughs at y ...
are you crying ?
no , i have allergies .
okay , um , oh , hey , how about her ?
sure , if he wants to spend a couple years
doing her homework while she drinks herself
into a stupor with nonfat white russians .
and you &apos;re the one holding her head
out of the toilet while she &apos;s puking
and telling you she wishes &quot; more guys were like you . &quot;
and then she gets into cornell because you wrote her essay
for her and you drive up to visit her one weekend
and she acts like she doesn &apos;t even know you .
okay , so not her , either .
oh , hey , how about her ?
oh , interesting , kind of pretty ,
a little chubby , so probably low self @-@ esteem .
i think that &apos;s our girl .
one of us should go talk to her .
i can &apos;t talk to her-- you do it .
i can &apos;t just go up and talk to her .
howard , you talk to her .
i don &apos;t know , she &apos;ll never go for the kid
once she gets a peek at this .
you know , if we were in india , this would be simpler .
five minutes with her dad , 20 goats and a laptop ,
and we &apos;d be done .
well , we &apos;re not in india .
all right , why don &apos;t we do it your way then ?
we &apos;ll arrange for this girl
to move in across the hall from dennis
so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end .
okay , that was uncalled for .
you started it , dude .
could i have everyone &apos;s attention , please ?
what a wonderful occasion this is ,
and how fortunate that it should happen to fall
on take your daughter to work day .
we &apos;re here to welcome
mr. dennis kim to our little family .
welcome , dennis kim .
mr. kim
was not only the valedictorian at stanford university ,
he is also the youngest recipient
of the prestigious stevenson award .
youngest till the cyborgs rise up !
and now , without any further ado ,
let me introduce the man of the hour ,
mr. dennis kim .
dennis ?
dennis !
what ? !
would you like to tell us
a little bit about your upcoming research ?
no , thanks .
i &apos;m going to the mall with emma .
the kid got a girl .
unbelievable .
did anyone see how he did it ?
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;ve got this .
ladies and gentlemen ,
honored daughters , while mr. kim ,
by virtue of his youth and naivete ,
has fallen prey to the inexplicable need
for human contact , let me step in
and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted ,
and that social relationships will continue to baffle
and repulse me .
thank you .
he &apos;s back .
yeah , mission accomplished .
forget the mission .
how did that little yutz get a girl on his own ?
i guess times have changed since we were young .
smart is the new sexy .
then why do we go home alone every night ?
we &apos;re still smart .
maybe we &apos;re too smart .
so smart it &apos;s off @-@ putting .
yeah , let &apos;s go with that .
unbelievable .
components i built
are on the international space station and i get a ticket
for launching a model rocket in the park .
i don &apos;t know if the ticket was
so much for the launch as it was
for you telling the policewoman ,
&quot; you have to frisk me .
i have another rocket in my pants . &quot;
hey , look at that .
it &apos;s dennis kim .
wow , i almost didn &apos;t recognize him .
you know , i kind of feel bad about what we did to him .
yeah , we really ruined his life .
