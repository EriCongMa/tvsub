house slaves will never be gladiators .
a thing we are in short supply of .
keys , quickly !
release them !
our ranks swell .
we will need more weapons .
gratitude for your kindness ,
know that i have treasured it .
is it true ?
did you lay with her ?
oenomaus .
i would have you end the life of gaius claudius glaber .
glaber &apos;s own wife ,
this very night leaves for rome .
your men are now mine .
第八集
where do you take me ?
please , i am with child --
someone approaches .
follow fucking lead .
and do not stray from it .
come .
what brings you so far from road , brother ?
with one so ripe ?
an ancient horse , gone to grass .
the woods offer shorter distance for my wife to pompeii .
shorter by a lifetime , if tread absent caution .
spartacus and his fucks set upon a wagon
not far from here recently .
spartacus ?
perhaps , we should be on our way , my love .
unless similar misfortune fall upon us .
ah , it appears it already has .
how did you come by that ?
our horse , when it fell .
on the road to pompeii , yes .
you have business there ?
meat and bone , carved for coin .
a butcher ?
fine dress , for wife of such .
he &apos;s a gladiator !
i am the praetor &apos;s --
apologies .
help me !
somebody , help me !
help me !
raise voice again ,
and i will hack tongue from fucking mouth .
ask any price .
my husband will see it paid for my return .
i seek no ransom .
you are going to rob me of my life ?
no .
it &apos;s not mine to take .
i could have speared him .
he was beyond your throw .
you know the distance better than my own hand ? do you ?
i know many things regarding the great and powerful spartacus .
great and powerful ?
and kind and just .
i have peered into your very heart ,
and know what it holds .
you would not have found content so pleasing ,
if you had chanced upon me in my youth .
i stood more animal than man .
and what tamed the wild beast ?
your wife , of course .
apologies --
take the life of glaber &apos;s woman ,
as he took the life of yours .
see end to vengeance ,
and with it the suffering of all caught between you and such desires .
i am to blame for her fate .
had i not broken words with gannicus
he never would have known ilithyia was the road .
an unfortunate slip of the tongue .
i thought only to convince gannicus of proper path .
to willingly follow your command and join the hunt for spartacus .
the man is probably in league with the fucking thracian .
they were both slaves under your house , were they not ?
separated by a distance of years .
they never have met one another .
that we have knowledge of .
not that it is a thing of matter now .
gannicus now holds my wife and unborn child .
if she yet draws breath .
he would not have risked all to take her from the city
only to have her life .
she yet lives .
i feel her heart beating as though it were my own .
your men must scour the countryside until she is found .
such an area takes months to cover with numbers at hand .
then send message to rome for aid .
word of this shall not spread beyond these walls .
but ilithyia --
was snatched from grasp of a praetor of rome .
i will not have the senate whisper
of how i could not protect my own wife .
a wise choice .
you must look towards your future .
you talk of politics ?
ilithyia is valued friend and wife .
she holds the blessing of your child ,
and with him slim tether to albinius &apos; wealth .
one which will be severed if she is not found .
do not lecture on what is at fucking risk .
praetor .
you have seen it done ?
all trace of your wife &apos;s misfortune has been erased .
no one will know of it .
good .
gather your men .
seppia , i would have a moment .
i would not raise voice in such manner with him again ,
if you wish to keep purchase in this world .
absent ilithyia &apos;s blessings ,
it is a place that i shall quickly tumble from .
i would never let you fall so far , my love .
not while i yet treasure your company .
good ...
now keep eye on angle of my shoulders ...
it will give clue to my next --
you learn quickly .
i have advantage .
of being taught by a god .
again .
harudes !
you betray intent by bellowing like a crazed goat !
nemetes !
saxa !
take position .
are we to use wooden stick in battle as well ?
close mouth and heed oenomaus .
i need no instruction .
i fucking know how to fight .
i instruct you not how to fight , but how to win .
so you do not find yourself again enslaved by the romans .
first position !
attack !
nemetes does hold argument .
towards lack of proper weapons at least .
fuck the gods .
you have taken glaber &apos;s wife ?
no .
she has been delivered into my hands .
and they will see her to proper end .
whore !
beg for your life !
is this our cause now ?
falling upon a helpless woman heavy with child ?
glaber held no pity towards my wife .
a woman far more deserving than the thing that stands before you .
fucking bitch !
coin before cunt , you worthless shit .
now crawl from sight .
get up you old cunt !
linger yet a while ,
my good man .
we &apos;ll have the pleasure of your company .
what do you seek of me now , syrian ?
gannicus .
a gladiator of some renown in capua .
he has been noted to frequent your establishment ,
has he not ?
partaking of wine and whores ?
yes , praetor .
i would have words with the man .
he is not here .
yet there must be some among you
who have that cause to share drink ...
and other distractions with him .
i would know of what he spoke ,
towards revelation of where he secrets himself .
and i would hope for another fucking drink
and a whore upon my cock --
let me ask it of you again .
who among you has spoken with gannicus ?
disappointing .
wait !
wait !
i did see gannicus break words !
who was privy to them ?
my slave , marcia .
where is she ?
your fucking syrian nailed her to a cross .
and i have yet to receive fair compensation for loss incurred --
gannicus has taken something from me .
and i will see it returned .
put all to question .
please do not do this ...
were those same words pleaded by my wife ?
before roman blade ripped her forever from my arms ?
i did not know of her .
my hands are unstained by the deed .
your husband cannot claim such .
he is the one that condemned her to slavery .
she is gone from this world because of it .
and i will have equal vengeance .
you can not do this !
my child --
sura and i often spoke of children .
of the family we would have ,
now forever denied me .
as i now deny glaber of his .
the child is yours .
you lie .
would that my tongue made false noise .
yet it sounds bitter truth .
monthly blood ceased after you came to me in batiatus &apos; villa ...
lucretia had promised crixus .
a cruel jest .
it is a memory that lingers , is it not ?
of that night .
of you inside me .
yes .
as does memory of my hands upon your throat .
then see to completion what they began .
take my life , and that of your child .
and may your wife turn from you for what you have done ,
when she greets you in the afterlife .
oenomaus does not seem lifted by your return .
i did not think to be embraced as brother .
nor i or to lay eyes upon you again in this life .
yet here you stand .
would that all things were so easily done .
i have seen the bond between you .
whatever the cause for disagreement ,
it will pass .
i would do anything , to rise in his eyes again .
capturing the praetor &apos;s bitch is a fine start .
an impressive act ,
sure to further ignite our cause .
i seek only to end it .
it is done , then ?
she yet lives .
i brand myself fucking enemy of rome
to deliver her to your hands .
only to find them weak and trembling .
i am not glaber .
able to strike a woman down
for his crimes absent misgivings .
and what of the women crucified
in the streets of capua ?
tortured to death because they dare whisper your name ,
eyes bright with thoughts of freedom and rebellion ?
take the her life and end this now .
or see countless more fall in the name of your cause .
prayer alone will not provide guidance through these dark times .
we must look inward ,
and find strength in heart &apos;s resolve .
so the gods turn from you , as they do from ilithyia ?
they are always with us .
their will felt in every breath .
in every touch ...
they guide our hands ,
compelling us toward proper course .
gaius will be pleased to hear of it .
it is not gaius who holds the key to ilithyia &apos;s salvation .
i fear the gods have led you far astray then .
i command no army , nor can i conjure gannicus before us .
yet message from you would bring varinius from rome ,
and with him -- - gaius was clear in the matter .
we are to tell no one of what has happened .
words borne of desperation .
he talks of shoring name while life &apos;s foundation
crumbles beneath his feet .
seppia .
seppia .
you sought praetor varinius &apos; affections once .
send message , and you could yet gain them .
the whims of a child .
such thoughts have been set aside in favor of mature pursuits .
the day has been long .
i will see you beneath the covers .
we will revisit the subject with the morning sun .
apologies , i &apos;m not yet for bed .
i would check upon gaius ,
and offer words of comfort .
are words all that you would offer ?
i am his guest in this house .
and wish only to pay tribute to generous host .
it &apos;s beneath you , seppia .
the gods shall take ill notice--
was it not their hands that saw my brother struck from my side ?
their providence that sheltered me beneath this very roof ?
do you not see it ?
the gods have lead me upon path to gaius .
as their will has removed ilithyia from it .
calm yourself .
i intend no harm .
you are the one that came to aid .
when those animals turned upon me when i was brought in .
do not clutch me to breast .
i shit with the rest of those animals .
for child .
at least you will not die of hunger .
you bear no brand .
you are a free man ?
i am of the republic , as you and yours .
yet you stand with spartacus against it .
i stand for what is just .
just ?
spartacus moves to destroy everything we hold of worth .
then he moves too late in my regard .
sulla seized my lands and those of my kin years ago ,
slaughtering any who resisted .
and giving what he stole as gift to his most loyal of men .
all of them fellow romans .
such a loss must weigh heavy in the passing of years .
i would see burden lifted .
and i mistake you for helpless ,
yet you have power to reverse the sun
and see past reformed ?
my husband is a praetor of rome .
and i of importance to him ,
being prized daughter of my clan ,
my child heir to its lineage and fortune --
save vaunted words for grander ear .
i cannot free you .
we would both be absent fucking head
before three steps could be taken .
i do not ask such a thing .
only that you carry message ,
imparting where spartacus holds me .
you do not have to live this way .
all that was taken from you can yet be restored ,
with but simple command from my husband .
the sum of my loss is no small thing .
he can see it paid .
your life returned to you ,
in exchange for mine
and the child i carry .
she claims it yours ?
with passion of certainty .
she is a deceitful fucking snake ,
truth split by forked tongue .
her words may hold such in this .
do you recall the night in batiatus &apos; villa ,
when you aided in transforming likeness into golden apollo ?
to lay with the roman woman licinia .
she wore the mask of diana .
yet beneath it was not licinia .
ilithyia .
why did you not tell me ?
what purpose would it have held ?
none .
nor should it hold any for you now .
even if true , she tells you only to stay your hand .
she &apos;s a fool .
to know she carries heritage forever denied my own wife ...
see ilithyia to her grave .
and tortured past buried beside her .
to make glaber suffer as i have
at his hand is a thing i have craved more than air and breath .
yet in inflicting equal wound ,
how do i not become as the man himself ?
a man my wife would turn from .
i was not certain you would desire this .
what man could not ?
it is not the offering that gave concern .
rather your preoccupation with unfortunate events .
the fate of my heir does weigh mind .
that of your wife &apos;s ?
a thing of lesser notice .
is bond of marriage really such a cold affair ?
there was a time ....
when the love between us burned hot ,
bright as noon @-@ day sun .
but day has turned to night ,
casting golden memories to shadow .
i would have you bask in the light ,
as a man of your worth deserves .
albinius did not hold me to such esteem .
nor the rest of the senate .
gaze into their eyes when you present spartacus &apos; head ,
and see estimation soar .
and my brother avenged .
would that his death did not pain you so .
the sting lessens with each passing day .
because of you .
and i would return favor ,
if your wife falls prey to spartacus ,
as my brother fell ...
your chest overflows with coin and blood .
both well earned by day &apos;s exertion .
what news of ilithyia did labors bring ?
you have the praetor &apos;s ear .
did he not already fill yours ?
his attentions toward young seppia
prevent me from breaking words .
ah , the freshness of youth .
is it a wonder he favors the caress of her tongue
to the sound of yours ?
her bloom will wither , when ilithyia returns .
you place great stock upon uncertain future .
you have not found path to gannicus ?
sadly it remains obscured .
though not through lack of noble effort .
from there we moved from place to place ,
questioning with fist and blade .
the answer always the same .
i will make sacrifice to the gods .
and entreat them for more valued response .
let us pray together .
and seek divinity in warm embrace ...
ilithyia and the child she carries must be found .
if they are lost --
what ? hmmm ?
will the sun no longer move across the sky ?
will ivory moon plummet into frothing sea ?
strike the bitch from fucking thought ,
as glaber has already done --
i am not your slave to lay fucking hand upon .
a lesson i had thought already learned .
apologies .
i question sincerity of the word .
speak it again .
apologies .
again .
apologies --
your position in this house continues to spiral .
soon i will be all that stands between you and dark abyss .
when the day arrives ...
you shall greet my breath upon your neck as precious gift .
do you understand this , my love ?
yes .
a gift from the gods ...
lucius .
where do you go ?
to clear troubled mind .
i would have the same .
let us walk together for a moment , and break words .
the man unleashes wrath upon wooden form .
when i have risked all for him
to seize vengeance and end this .
you take risk only to lighten weighted conscience .
i would not see more fall to foolish cause .
and i would not see my brother fall .
we no longer stand as such .
is there no path towards mended bond ?
you cannot mend illusion .
our brotherhood .
the trust i placed upon you .
a thing of lies and deceit .
do you not think a day passes that i am not consumed by it ?
i would give my life for melitta to yet own hers .
and i would gladly take it .
then what stays hand ?
do you and spartacus straddle same uncertain ground ?
unable to take vengeance when it is placed before you ?
your death would not see her again to my arms .
it would only serve as mercy ,
releasing you from what you have done .
then i stand condemned ,
until the afterlife takes me .
you stand for nothing .
as you always have .
we must wait ...
till spartacus relieves us of charge .
time passes too slowly ...
we must be quick then .
this is how you stand guard ?
apologies , we were ....
ah , we were -- we were , we were just -- - we --
take to your bed .
i will assume watch over ilithyia .
gratitude .
please .
i would have more water .
it is a terrible thing , is it not ?
to live in want and fear .
that is what it is to be a slave .
please .
for my child .
is it true ?
what you told spartacus ?
i swear to the gods .
if spartacus takes my life ,
the blood of his child will forever stain his own .
he is a good man .
i will not let him be destroyed by this .
i will not let him kill you .
you will help me ?
yes . i will help you .
from this fucking world .
have you lost mind ?
i move only to spare you from what must be done .
if you take her life ,
the deed will weigh every breath .
so you remove choice ,
and invite such fate upon yourself ?
i would embrace it ,
to see your heart spared from the act .
you do not know my heart .
spartacus --
leave us .
i would have words now .
and see your time here at an end .
you glow like the morning sun .
you must have slept well .
hardly at all .
it &apos;s an unfortunate thing .
i would not deem it so .
i fear you shall .
out .
i will not have you threaten in such a manner .
i do not move to threats .
only to warning about the man you turn affections towards .
your words will not turn me from him .
the time for them has passed .
come .
i have something more tangible to show you --
where is the praetor ?
in his chamber .
what &apos;s happened ?
a man comes with news of ilithyia .
you claim to have knowledge of my wife ?
more than claim .
she is being held by spartacus .
she lives ?
for the moment .
how do you know this ?
i have just traveled from the rebel &apos;s camp .
you stand as one of his men ?
i am no fugitivus .
just a tired old man ,
seeking what little peace he can
before falling to eternal slumber .
well , tell me where she &apos;s being held
and you will be seen to great reward .
your wife boasted of your generosity
and promised the return of my lands seized by the bastard sulla .
is such a thing possible ?
it is within my power .
and what of my own wife ?
my children .
my brothers and sisters ,
all slaughtered in the name of rome .
is it within your power to return them to too ,
you fucking cunt ?
lay a hand on me and your wife dies .
if i do not return within reasonable hour , she dies .
any attempts to follow me , she dies .
what would spartacus have of me ?
gaius --
speak .
you are to enter the city of atella on foot ,
just before rise of morning sun .
three of your men allowed by your side .
spartacus to hold the same .
and ilithyia ?
she will be returned to you afterwards .
in exchange for a single wagon ,
heavily weighted with armor and weapons .
give arms to the enemies of rome ?
that is his price .
if your troops are seen on road to atella ,
spartacus will not appear .
and your wife and the child she carries ,
be lost to you forever .
did i mention the part about laying hands upon me ?
let him pass .
i do not trust this .
nor i.
yet action must be taken .
prepare a wagon .
praetor , we can not aid them
with means to forge further war upon us .
what choice has spartacus left ?
there are always choices .
no .
spartacus leaves but one path .
and i must travel upon it .
i am old , but not a fool .
it was much to ask , entering the lair of the beast .
oh it was great pleasure , to piss in the face of a fucking praetor .
spartacus ?
glaber agrees to the terms ?
i am for atella , to see it done .
let us take his weapons !
and his fucking life !
no .
if we do not honor word ,
we prove ourselves no better than the romans .
we shall hold to it .
if three are all that can be seen with you ,
i would count myself among them .
as would i , despite the company .
i would join as well .
i would welcome no one as warmly .
yet you have not healed from ordeal in the arena .
i will stand in his place .
for a cause you do not believe in ?
oenomaus believes in it .
perhaps one day i shall too .
return with proper weapons .
and your lives .
it is madness to place trust in the words of glaber .
i do not place it with him .
i place it with all those i take with me .
we will see this done , together .
and gain means to strike glaber and his army from this world .
spartacus !
the old man claims you have my wife .
cut from her dress .
her scent yet upon it .
a thing easily taken from a body robbed of life .
my thoughts turned toward such a thing .
blade parting flesh .
her blood upon the ground ,
as my wife &apos;s blood was spilled .
yet you do not claim her life .
i am not you .
i will not strike down a woman
for the foolish acts of her husband .
you carved my name into a dead man &apos;s chest .
make attempt against my life in the streets of capua .
and then again in the arena .
yet you turn from most assured opportunity to balance debt between us .
i turn from nothing .
one day soon , i will have your life .
bring the wagon forward .
i hold many regrets ,
since first we laid eyes on each other a lifetime ago .
i pray this decision does not stand amongst them .
you will hold your wife again .
and she will deliver you an heir .
yet when you gaze into the child &apos;s eyes ,
i will forever be reflected there ...
in memory of how i spared them both .
i fear you are right .
you are not like me .
your wife was the heart that beats within your breast .
you would have given all to see her live .
while i would do the same ...
to see you dead .
kill them !
now !
take cover !
salvius !
give call !
fall back !
you waited long enough to give signal .
i cling to honor ignored .
quickly !
before they recover !
take to foot .
i would stay awhile .
lucius --
go .
before i come to fucking sense .
at least it &apos;s not a fucking roman that takes --
do not let them breach the woods !
go ! go !
you never intended to make trade ?
i intended to send spartacus to his death .
deserved fate he yet evades through treachery and deceit .
you will have him soon enough .
at price of wife ,
and the blessing she carries ?
i would gladly pay the sum of the world
to have his throat beneath my heel .
ilithyia must return to this house .
the gods have foreseen --
the gods can descend from their fucking heavens
if they wish to see her live !
in coming days i shall grieve loss of wife and child ,
and the fortunes carried upon her family name .
and we shall grieve with you .
i would see myself to bath .
and blood and troubled thoughts of moment washed away .
go .
i will bring more wine to aid endeavor .
do you know what he has done ?
what he felt he must ,
to see an end to spartacus .
he has pulled the world to ruin .
and with it reason for living .
your reason perhaps .
my heart yet beats .
and what of your brother &apos;s ?
gaius moves to avenge his death .
then he should turn wrath upon himself ,
and see it done .
it &apos;s your brother &apos;s , is it not ?
i had thought his slaves took it with his life .
they stand blemished by neither offense .
how did you come by this ?
the gods led me to the truth .
hidden amongst ashur &apos;s treasures .
stripped from the bodies of those who have died at his hand .
ashur ?
he must have been there that night ,
when your brother fell .
yet the villain moves only upon command
of gaius claudius glaber .
much has been lost .
the ones we have loved .
the ones we thought would forever be at our side .
but in their passing ,
the chains that bound us to desires not our own have been struck .
and without such a blow ,
we would not find ourselves in each other &apos;s arms .
no .
we would not .
kneel .
please ...
do you know what it is ?
to love ?
to be filled with light and hope ?
to see that blessing returned in kind ,
in the eyes of the only one
that could ever know the true depth of your heart ?
that is what your husband took from me .
i would take the same from him .
yet he chose vengeance against me over your life .
taking it would balance nothing .
he does not love you ,
as i loved my wife .
you let me live ?
