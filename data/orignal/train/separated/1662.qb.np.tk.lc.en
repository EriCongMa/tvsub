so two years later , there &apos;s a knock on the door .
guy opens it , and there on his porch is the snail ,
who says , &quot; what the heck was all that about ? &quot;
i don &apos;t really get it .
well , see , it took two years for the snail to ...
not important .
can i ask you a question ?
sure .
where do you think this is going ?
to be honest , i was hoping at least second base .
you &apos;re so funny .
you &apos;re like a stand @-@ up comedian .
a jewish stand @-@ up comedian , that &apos;d be new .
actually , i think a lot of them are jewish .
no , i was just ... never mind .
look , howard , this is our third date
and we both know what that means .
we do ?
sex .
you &apos;re kidding .
but i need to know whether you &apos;re looking
for a relationship or a one @-@ night stand .
okay , just to be clear :
there &apos;s only one correct answer , right ?
it &apos;s not like &quot; chicken or fish &quot; on an airplane ?
maybe you need to think about it a little .
you know , it &apos;s not unheard of
for a one @-@ night stand to turn into a relationship .
call me when you figure it out .
three dates means sex ?
who knew ?
greetings , homies .
homette .
why are you back from your date so early ?
in romance , as in show business ,
always leave them wanting more .
what exactly does that mean ?
he struck out .
hey , did either of you guys know
that three dates with the same woman
is the threshold for sex ?
actually , i &apos;ve never had three dates with the same woman .
with penny and me , it took two years .
now that i think about it , that was three dates .
okay , well , before you and penny hooked up ,
did she ask for any kind of commitment ?
no , she was pretty clear about
wanting to keep her options open .
i have something to announce ,
but out of respect for convention , i will wait for you
to finish your current conversation .
what are you talking about ?
the cultural paradigm in which people have sex
after three dates .
i see .
now , are we talking &quot; date , &quot; the social interaction ,
or &quot; date , &quot; the dried fruit ?
never mind , what &apos;s your announcement ?
oh , good , my turn . well , this is very exciting
and i wanted you to be among the first to know ...
hey , cooper .
i hear you &apos;re going to be on the radio
with ira flatow from &lt; i &gt; science friday &lt; / i &gt; next week .
thank you , kripke , for depriving me of the opportunity
to share &lt; i &gt; my &lt; / i &gt; news with &lt; i &gt; my &lt; / i &gt; friends .
my pleasure .
my &quot; thank you &quot; was not sincere .
but &quot; my pleasure &quot; is .
let me ask you a question :
at what point did national public radio
have to start scraping the bottom of the barrel
for its guests ?
don &apos;t answer . it &apos;s rhetorical .
why are you such a stupid head ?
that is also rhetorical .
i &apos;m sorry you had to hear that .
are you really going to be on npr ?
yes , they &apos;re interviewing me by phone from my office ,
regarding the recent so @-@ called &quot; discovery &quot;
of magnetic monopoles in spin @-@ ices .
it &apos;s pledge week and they &apos;re trying to goose the ratings
with a little controversy .
very cool , congratulations .
thank you . my mother is very excited .
she &apos;s convening her &lt; i &gt; bible &lt; / i &gt; study group to listen in ,
and then pray for my soul .
i was on the radio once .
i called in to fever 104 fm new delhi
and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays :
&quot; fever 104 , &lt; i &gt; aajke naye &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; acchha sangeetka ghar . &quot; &lt; / i &gt;
that means : &quot; fever 104,
home of the really good current music . &quot;
it &apos;s much catchier in hindi .
all right . these are the talking points
for my npr interview tomorrow .
i need to make sure that they &apos;re simple enough
for the less educated in the audience to understand .
howard , look this over and tell me what &apos;s unclear to you .
excuse me , i have a master &apos;s degree in engineering
from the massachusetts institute of technology .
it required the completion of 144 units of grad work
and an original thesis .
yes .
look this over and tell me what &apos;s unclear to you .
you know , when sheldon gives you homework ,
you don &apos;t have to do it .
in fact , it &apos;s better if you don &apos;t ,
otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad .
hi , guys .
hey . hello .
yo , raj , talk to me .
i &apos;m sorry , just screwing with you .
hey , howard , why haven &apos;t you called bernadette ?
did she say something ?
yeah , she said she hasn &apos;t heard from you in a week .
i thought you liked her ?
i do , but she wants a commitment
and i &apos;m not sure she &apos;s my type .
she agreed to go out with you for free .
what more do you need ?
look , bernadette is really nice .
i just always thought when i finally settle down
into a relationship , it would be with someone ,
you know , different .
different how ?
well , you know , more like megan fox from transformers .
or katee sackhoff
from battlestar galactica .
are you high ?
you &apos;d have a better shot with the three @-@ breasted
martian hooker from total recall .
okay , now you &apos;re just being unrealistic .
anyway , that movie was like 20 years ago .
imagine how saggy those thing would be .
howard , you &apos;re going to throw away a great girl like bernadette
because you &apos;re holding out for some ridiculous fantasy ?
hey , just because you settled doesn &apos;t mean i have to .
excuse me , i &apos;m sitting here .
hey , i did not settle for leonard .
i mean , obviously , he isn &apos;t the kind of guy i usually go out with ...
you know , physically .
again , i &apos;m right here .
my point is , i do not judge a book by its cover .
i am interested in the person underneath .
i am here , right ? you see me .
hey , i &apos;m interested in what &apos;s inside people , too ,
but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in ,
say , the delicious caramel that is halle berry ?
yes , you &apos;re delicious caramel , too .
all right , you know what , i will tell you
why it &apos;s wrong ... excuse me , may i interject ?
what ?
biologically speaking ,
howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate
for the propagation of his genetic line .
thank you , sheldon .
now , whether that
propagation is in the interest of humanity is , of course ,
an entirely different question .
this is ira flatow and you &apos;re listening
to npr &apos;s science friday .
joining us today by phone
from his office in pasadena , california
is dr. sheldon cooper .
oh , this is going to be a riot .
thanks for being with us today , dr. cooper .
my pleasure , ira .
now , let &apos;s talk about magnetic monopoles .
can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is ?
of course .
first , consider an ordinary magnet which has ,
as even the most uneducated
in your audience must know , two poles .
a north and south pole .
if you cut that in half , you have two smaller magnets ,
each with its own north and south pole .
uh , dr. cooper , i think there might be
something wrong with our connection .
no , i hear you fine .
as i was saying , an ordinary magnet has two poles .
the primary characteristic of a monopole
is that it has only one pole , hence , monopole .
a requirement for string theory ,
or m @-@ theory , if you will ,
is the existence of such monopoles .
i , myself , led an expedition
to the arctic circle in search of said particles .
kripke , i found the nozzle ! i &apos;m going to kill you !
so nice you could join me this evening .
you &apos;re looking lovely as always .
thanks , howard .
always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies .
come on , katee .
don &apos;t make it sound so cheap .
i &apos;m sorry , fiddling with yourself in the bathtub
is a real class act .
thank you .
so , shall we get started ?
sure .
but can i ask you a question first ?
do you want to play cylon and colonist ?
no .
i want to know why you &apos;re playing make @-@ believe with me
when you could be out with a real woman tonight .
you mean , bernadette ?
no , i mean princess leia .
of course i mean bernadette .
she &apos;s a wonderful girl and she really likes you .
i know , but she &apos;s not you .
i &apos;m not me .
the real me is in beverly hills
going out with a tall , handsome , rich guy .
really ? tall ?
six @-@ four .
ouch .
the point is , you &apos;ve got a wonderful girl in your life ,
and you &apos;re ignoring her in order to spend your nights
in the bathtub with a mental image and a wash cloth .
howard !
what are you doing in there ?
i &apos;m taking a bath !
i hope that &apos;s all you &apos;re doing !
we share that tub !
don &apos;t remind me !
oh , man .
all soaped up and no place to go .
how ya doin &apos; , buddy ?
i was humiliated on national radio .
how do you think i &apos;m doing ?
come on , it wasn &apos;t that bad .
what do you want ?
( munchkin voice ) : we represent the lollipop guild ,
and we want you .
okay , so kripke played a joke on you .
it wasn &apos;t funny .
i thought it was funny .
raj .
you laughed .
did you laugh ?
i fell on the floor .
all right , he got you .
you can get him back .
i refuse to sink to his level .
you can &apos;t sink . with all that helium in you ,
you &apos;re lucky you don &apos;t float away .
are you really admitting defeat ?
i never admit defeat .
good .
however , on an unrelated topic ,
i am never getting out of this bed again .
what if you could make kripke
look even sillier than he made you look ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s possible , dude .
you &apos;re not helping .
i didn &apos;t come to help , i came to mock .
sheldon , what you need to do is figure out a way
to exact vengeance on kripke , like , uh ,
like , how the joker got back at batman for putting him
in the arkham asylum for the criminally insane .
that &apos;s true . he didn &apos;t just stay there and talk about
his feelings with the other psychotic villains .
he , he broke out and poisoned gotham &apos;s water supply .
well ...
i suppose i could poison kripke .
no !
no . it &apos;s a simple matter .
there are several toxic chemicals
that &apos;d be untraceable in an autopsy .
okay , uh , that &apos;s the spirit ,
but , um , let &apos;s dial it back
to a non @-@ lethal form of vengeance .
how about we whoopee cushion on his office chair ?
he &apos;ll sit down , it &apos;ll sound like
he &apos;s flatulent , even though he &apos;s not .
let &apos;s keep thinking .
oh , gee , you &apos;re too late .
scarlett johansson and wonder woman were just in here
trolling around for neurotic , little weasels .
i came to talk to bernadette . she &apos;s working today , right ?
yes , but i don &apos;t think she wants to see you .
why not ?
come on , howard . you hurt her feelings
by not calling her all week .
plus , i &apos;ve kind of been talkin &apos; some smack about ya .
hello , howard .
wait , bernadette , i need to talk to you .
i can &apos;t now , i &apos;m working .
this will only take a second .
you asked me to think about where
our relationship was going , and i did .
bernadette ?
will you marry me ?
is this more comedy that i don &apos;t understand ?
no . i &apos;m serious .
i &apos;m never going to find another girl like you
who likes me and is , you know , real .
so , this isn &apos;t a joke ?
no .
then you &apos;re insane .
i prefer to think of myself as quirky .
howard , we &apos;ve only been on three dates .
we haven &apos;t even had sex yet .
fair enough .
when &apos;s your break ?
don &apos;t you just hate when this happens ?
all right , how &apos;s this for revenge ?
a solution of hydrogen peroxide ,
and one of saturated potassium iodide .
what &apos;s this ?
mountain dew .
ahh , refreshing .
we &apos;re going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap ,
creating a &lt; i &gt; little &lt; / i &gt; exothermic release of oxygen .
foamy vengeance .
yes , exactly .
this is brilliant , sheldon .
how are we going to deploy it in kripke &apos;s office ?
already taken care of .
observe .
this is a live shot of kripke &apos;s lab via a mini webcam
i was able to install , thanks to a dollar bill
discreetly placed in the night janitor &apos;s shirt pocket .
at the same time ,
i also secured large quantities of these chemicals
above the tiles in the drop ceiling .
oh , sheldon ,
you remind me of a young lex luthor .
you flatter me , sir .
let me guess : motion sensors ?
yes .
the reaction will be triggered
when kripke reaches the center of the room .
mwah , ha , ha .
i gotta say , i am really impressed .
this is truly the sheldon cooper way to get even .
it may be low @-@ tech ,
but i still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity .
here comes kripke !
who is that with him ?
i believe that &apos;s the president of the university .
and the board of directors.abort ! abort !
there is no &quot; abort . &quot;
how could you not put in an &quot; abort ? &quot;
i made a boo @-@ boo , all right ?
i think the board will really appreciate
how well we &apos;re using that nsa grant , president seibert .
right here we have a micro @-@ controlled plasma ...
wow . looks like the ganges on laundry day .
at least they don &apos;t know it was you .
hello , kripke .
this classic prank comes to you
from the malevolent mind of sheldon cooper .
if you &apos;d like to see the look on your stupid face ,
this video is being instantly uploaded to youtube .
oh , and a hat tip to leonard hofstadter and raj koothrappali
for their support and encouragement in this enterprise .
well , i &apos;m going back to india.what &apos;s your plan ?
hey , here &apos;s your tip from table seven .
oh , thanks .
testing . check.check two .
oh , now what ?
you want me to throw him out ?
no , that &apos;s okay .
are you sure ? he &apos;s small .
i bet i can get a nice , tight spiral on him .
i want to dedicate this number
to a great gal who i &apos;ve done wrong .
bernadette
* i am so sorry for
* trying to propose to you
* bernadette
* you found it creepy
* but that &apos;s just the kind of thing i do *
* i know now it was too soon to talk of love *

* but , bernadette , give me one more chance *
* sweet bernadette
