emily !
dr. vargas called .
he wanted to know
if i &apos;d ever given you any of the hydrocodone
i was prescribed last year .
let &apos;s go . get in the car .
let go of my arm !
i heard from upenn this morning ....
and i didn &apos;t get in .
were you in new york the whole time you were gone ?
of course . where else would i be ?
she called me , came over .
i keep a gun locked in my desk . it &apos;s missing .
i gave the rv to &quot; a &quot; for nothing .
i think &quot; a &quot; gave you something real .
gotta find dr . palmer .
vienna .
would you like to come with me ?
this was from the studio that ali went to ?
he copied your sister &apos;s face
just like he did alison &apos;s ..
how many of those masks did you make ?
i &apos;ll tell you what i know , and you give me something in return .
what do you want ?
your face .
you lied to me .
i do not have to account for myself to you .
you told the emt you fell off your bike .
that &apos;s what happened .
family services called . they want to interview me .
about what ?
something thought i was a bit excessive with you
outside the school .
thanks .
hello , em .
don &apos;t be late for school , huh ?
okay , so he thinks my mom stole the gun ?
your dad &apos;s not sure , okay ?
it could have been missing before she got there .
he just knows it was gone after she left .
no . it &apos;s not possible .
it &apos;s beyond possible .
it &apos;s what happened .
hanna , your dad owned a .38 .
if it turns out that wilden was shot with a .38,
your mom has a lot more to explain than not having an alibi .
is this what you call helping ?
as a matter of fact , yes .
well , it &apos;s not .
hey , hanna . if this looks bad to us ,
how do you think it &apos;s gonna look to those state cops ?
just forget it , okay ? !
forget what ?
forget the gun , forget you spoke to my father ,
just forget everything you ever told me !
hanna , forgetting is not gonna work in this situation .
just ... don &apos;t do anything , okay ?
spence .
did you show your sister the mask yet ?
morning , hanna .
hi . did you ?
not yet .
what are you waiting for ?
we can &apos;t just let her get away with it
because she &apos;s your sister , spencer .
take it down a notch .
that mask puts melissa at the studio .
right now that all it does .
she &apos;s leaving town
and she &apos;s about to pin it on my mom before she goes .
if she &apos;s &quot; a. &quot;
she has to be .
guys .
emily , please tell them . we have to do something .
you okay ?
my dad &apos;s home .
isn &apos;t that usually a good thing ?
no . he &apos;s back because
family services wants to talk to us .
those are the ones you told me about ?
that &apos;s them .
if i dressed like that when i was in high school ,
my dad would had a stroke .
i coulda gotten used to it .
don &apos;t make me sorry i picked you for this .
we &apos;re not here to get cozy .
i know . we &apos;re here to solve a couple of homicides
the locals keep tripping over .
and find out what it is about those four pretty girls
that attracts so many corpses .
what if hector realized
that melissa &apos;s mask is missing ?
that guy has so many headss
he &apos;ll never miss one .
i think i have to write that sentence down .
it &apos;s my dad .
he wants me to come straight home after school .
come on , they can &apos;t really think
that there &apos;s something wrong with your family .
i don &apos;t know what they think .
i lied about getting hurt , i lied about the pills ...
little lies .
that &apos;s the problem .
a big lie gives you something to hang onto .
the trouble starts when you shave the truth
and it just gets all twisted up .
all right , i gotta go .
hey , how &apos;s jake ?
jake &apos;s fine .
he was &quot; fine &quot; the last time we asked .
well , he &apos;s still fine .
is your mom really going to austria
with that muffin man ?
i think so .
austria &apos;s a long way from here .
i &apos;m counting on &quot; a &quot; not having a passport .
hey , spence . figure out what you want to do about melissa .
senior year &apos;s supposed to be the best year of your life .
did you know that ?
yeah , if you survive it .
i think you were really smart about the coat .
it was more than i wanted to spend ,
but i thought the weather in san francisco ,
the weather in london-- i could use it either place .
exactly . are you taking your other trench coat ?
i don &apos;t think so .
well , spencer could use it .
you like melissa &apos;s coat ,
the one with the new belt .
you &apos;d wear that , wouldn &apos;t you ?
it would be an honor and a privilege .
spencer , don &apos;t be like that .
like what ?
jealous of your sister .
i &apos;m not jealous .
mom .
this is a wonderful opportunity for her .
she &apos;s worked really hard .
things have not been easy for any of us .
we should be happy for her
after all that &apos;s happened .
it &apos;s all right . i understand .
if i were her , i would feel the same way .
would you ?
you &apos;re gonna miss sharing things with your sister .
graduation , going to upenn ...
uh , nobody &apos;s gonna miss that .
what do you mean ?
upenn . i &apos;m not going to upenn .
of course you are .
of course i &apos;m not .
i got my rejection letter .
spencer , this isn &apos;t funny .
okay , well , i think it &apos;s a scream .
i @-@ i don &apos;t think she &apos;s joking , mom .
you &apos;re so smart . please explain it to her .
no , you explain it to me .
okay , they rejected me ,
and wherever i go after graduation ,
it will not be to the family alma mater .
that &apos;s early admission . there are things we can do .
&quot; we &quot; are not gonna do anything .
stop it . listen to your sister . she &apos;s trying to help you .
i &apos;m not so sure spencer wants my help .
of course she does . don &apos;t you , spencer ?
yeah .
maybe there are a few things i could learn from her .
mom ?
oh . hello , hanna .
officer holbrook .
i met him at wilden &apos;s funeral .
this is my partner , lieutenant tanner .
hanna marin .
hello , hanna .
hello .
hanna , i &apos;ll call you .
oh , that &apos;s all right ,
she can stay . this isn &apos;t gonna take long .
whose box is that ?
darren wilden &apos;s .
oh , nice nest egg .
the bank discourages depositors
from keeping cash in their safe deposit boxes .
that &apos;s a good policy .
two passports .
one american , and one canadian .
you should warn your customers
about keeping firearms , too .
you think that &apos;s his drop gun ?
let &apos;s not speak ill of the dead , gabriel ,
but the serial number &apos;s been filed off .
so would you have been the one to take wilden into the vault ?
uh , if i was here , yes .
so as far as you know , no bank employee
has ever seen the contents of this box ?
that &apos;s right .
except for you .
i mean , just now ...
when he opened it .
yes , that would be the first time .
take everything , including the box .
would you mind if i have a butterscotch ?
please .
look , i understand that hanna &apos;s worried about her mom ,
but i want to find out what melissa &apos;s doing
just as much as she does .
more .
we have to know what she was doing with jenna and shana .
melissa &apos;s not gonna tell us anything .
we need some leverage .
what kind of leverage ?
her mask .
if we can blindside her with it ,
maybe can shake some real answers out of her .
i &apos;m just trying to understand what happened here .
listen , i gotta go .
okay .
we &apos;ll come up with something tomorrow .
&apos;night .
night .
he tells me social services is asking questions about my family .
the look on his face ...
i know .
i &apos;ve seen that look from people in town .
we &apos;ll deal with that .
there &apos;s nothing to feel ashamed of ,
but when you see that look--
i know . we &apos;ll deal with that .
it &apos;s just gossip .
i &apos;m worried about emmy .
you realize she &apos;s lying to us .
i know .
why is she lying ?
i think you got a really wrong impression of me from the other day .
really ?
yes , not your fault ,
nobody &apos;s fault ,
but sometimes you say something the wrong way
or it comes out wrong ,
and the person you &apos;re talking to ,
they think there &apos;s something going on when there isn &apos;t .
what &apos;s the problem , emily ?
nothing &apos;s the problem .
that &apos;s the point . but ...
did you talk to family services about me ?
yes .
well , you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
i mean , i can explain everything .
you have to call them back
and tell them that there &apos;s nothing to worry about .
emily , did someone pressure you
to come in and talk to me this morning ?
what ? no , i just want to straight this out .
this is a safe place . you can tell me the truth here .
i am telling you the truth .
okay , just forget i was here .
emily , wait .
i was gonna call you today .
i heard back on your x @-@ ray consult .
my x @-@ ray .
the mri confirmed a partial tear of the rotator cuff .
what does that mean ?
you &apos;ll need rest ,
and rehab to heal the muscle and regain function and strength .
depending on how that goes ,
there &apos;s a possibility of surgery .
what about swimming ?
if you swim now ,
it could completely tear the cuff ,
and then surgery would be the only option .
and after surgery ?
when it comes to athletes ,
the results of these procedures are ... unpredictable .
wow , those are really nice shoes .
thank you .
uh , lot of paperwork ?
i &apos;m just trying to stay ahead .
well , i don &apos;t want to interrupt .
you &apos;re not interrupting .
please .
you know , i &apos;ve been thinking a lot
about all the money you found in wilden &apos;s safe deposit box .
i mean , there must have been , like , thousands in there .
hmm . must have been .
and the other stuff too .
you know , the gun and ... the passports .
i mean , normal people really don &apos;t
keep that stuff in a safe deposit box , do they ?
you &apos;d be surprised what normpeople do .
i don &apos;t know , it just makes me think that maybe he was crooked
or ... in the russian mob or something .
is there a lot of russian mob activity here in rosewood ?
no , i just , um ,
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s something an honest person would do .
but i guess you figure all
that stuff out when you work on your case , right ?
mostly it &apos;s talking to people .
you know , the other day
i saw your partner talking to melissa hastings .
yes , he did talk to her .
yeah . she knew wilden .
they went to high school together .
they were pretty close .
he had a boat in cape may ,
and she went on it a couple times .
did you ever go on his boat ?
me ?
no .
how many times did you speak to wilden
over the past year or so ?
how many ?
well , a rough idea .
add it up .
the times that he came to your school to talk to you
when you and your friends were arrested with that shovel ,
and the times that he was at your house visiting your mother--
i mean , how often do you think ? ballpark number .
i &apos;ve been waiting for you at the brew .
what &apos;d you do , forget about me ?
ohh ! i &apos;m sorry . i totally forgot .
i @-@ i gotta go .
well , that &apos;s all right .
we &apos;ll finish our little talk later .
you &apos;re lucky i came along and got you out of that .
i know what i &apos;m doing , okay ?
no , you don &apos;t .
you &apos;re used to dealing with rosewood &apos;s finest .
they can &apos;t find their nightsticks with both hands .
she and that other detective are the real deal .
believe me , i know the difference .
i will do whatever it takes to protect my mother .
i don &apos;t care what she did .
hanna , we don &apos;t know what she did , okay ?
none of us do .
he &apos;s not in pennsylvania anymore .
i finally found him at a clinic in new york outside saratoga .
that &apos;s gotta be him .
dr. louis palmer , m.d.
he &apos;s not listed as staff ,
but it &apos;s probably some consulting emeritus kind of thing .
saratoga . that &apos;s a straight shot up i @-@ 87 .
do you want to try calling first ?
no . i don &apos;t want to take a chance that he won &apos;t talk to me .
i &apos;ll call you when i get there .
i thought we were both going .
you got your sister to worry about .
the sooner that i go , the sooner i can get some answers .
and the sooner we can tell the truth .
i &apos;ll talk to palmer and get him to tell me
what he didn &apos;t put in my mother &apos;s file .
do you have to go right now ?
now is all i &apos;ve got .
where is toby going ?
uh , he said it was about work .
you know what he &apos;s doing , don &apos;t you ?
spencer , he &apos;s going out to find the lair .
he can &apos;t do something like that on his own .
&quot; a &quot; really knows how to hold a grudge .
i think he &apos;ll be okay .
sorry i &apos;m late .
here &apos;s your tea .
thanks .
okay ...
so if you wanted a mask made , who would you ask ?
somebody who worked at a costume shop .
shana .
you think that shana &apos;s involved ?
i want to see what happens
when melissa comes face @-@ to @-@ face with the mask .
where would she go first ? would she go out to hector &apos;s ...
or to shana &apos;s ?
or somebody else .
i &apos;ll be right back .
okay .
are you ready for this ?
i can &apos;t tonight .
no . melissa isn &apos;t even home today .
i was thinking more tomorrow night .
ok . i can do that .
okay .
i &apos;m seeing jake later .
notice how i have no reaction to that ?
i am completely neutral .
come on , knock it off .
look , after everything that you &apos;ve been through ,
you deserve something a little bit less ...
... insane ? hopeless ? impossible ?
complicated .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying for .
i was worried when you missed practice .
won &apos;t be the only one i miss . doctor &apos;s orders .
that sucks .
extremely .
you &apos;re handing me an edge .
you don &apos;t need an edge .
everybody needs an edge .
cut off that last hundredth of a second .
you &apos;re a very competitive person .
in many ways .
what if i ...
what ?
nothing . nothing .
just give me a kiss , okay ?
are you serious ? come on .
the thing about jackie chan is , he doesn &apos;t make it look easy .
he shows you how hard it is .
yeah , he &apos;s kind of goofy sometimes , too .
well , goofiness is part of his charm .
aria !
hi , malcolm .
are--are you here alone ?
mom and ezra are inside . we &apos;re buying books .
books ? what kind of books ?
scary ones !
those are the best kind , right ?
yeah .
why don &apos;t you come over anymore ?
sometimes people get busy ,
they can &apos;t always do what they want to do .
look , you better get back inside before
your mom and dad start looking for you , okay ?
okay . bye .
bye !
see ya later , buddy .
nice kid .
yeah . he is .
who &apos;s ezra ? friend of the family ?
no , just one of my teachers .
well , i knew you were interesting when i met you .
i just didn &apos;t know how interesting .
yeah . i mean , when i tell the whole story like that ,
it kinda sounds like a movie .
black and white or color ?
happy parts are in color ,
the sad parts are in black and white .
you know you &apos;re not finished with him , don &apos;t you ?
no , i @-@ i have to be finished .
for everybody &apos;s sake .
you might have to be , but i &apos;m telling you you &apos;re not .
no , it &apos;s done . the movie &apos;s over .
what makes you so sure ?
do you really want to be with someone who &apos;d kiss you
after you tell him a story like that ?
but i have to do something .
i can &apos;t just ... stay in this place .
sometimes when i &apos;m teaching a class
a kid &apos;ll take a bad hit and he starts to cry .
and i &apos;ll ask him , &quot; are you hurt , or are you injured ?
&quot; if you &apos;re injured , i &apos;ll send you home . &quot;
&quot; but if you &apos;re hurt ...
shake it off and get back on the mat . &quot;
you have to figure out if you &apos;re hurt or you &apos;re injured .
look , i know that that was supposed to be helpful ,
but that just went clean over my head .
it &apos;s the only advice i have .
i use it for everything .
sometimes it applies .
can i call you ?
yes .
you can call me .
thank you .
dr. palmer ?
i &apos;m louis palmer , yes ?
my name is toby cavanaugh ,
i &apos;d like to ask you about a patient you had ...
when you worked at radley sanitarium .
in rosewood .
yes , sir , in rosewood .
the patient was my mother .
marion cavanaugh .
she killed herself .
please sit down .
so what &apos;d they say ?
they said for the time being
i won &apos;t be taking clients into the safe deposit vault .
wait . is this because of the state investigators and wilden &apos;s box ?
did they tell the bank to do this ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , ask them .
no more questions , hanna .
mom , you have the right to know !
and what if they say yes ?
&quot; yes , the state police suggested
it might be a good idea to keep you out of the vault . &quot;
what do i do then ?
i was kind of hoping with wilden dead
it &apos;d be the end of it .
i thought so too , for a minute .
now he &apos;s dead and things are worse then ever .
are they ?
this will not touch you .
i promise . no matter what happens ...
it won &apos;t touch you .
mom , i know you were here ...
in rosewood the night that wilden was killed .
how do you know that ?
i was kind of hoping that you would deny it one more time .
when something like that happens ,
you look back .
you take apart every conversation ...
&quot; did i do something wrong ? &quot;
&quot; did i miss a warning sign ? &quot;
you talked to her on the day she died .
yes . yes , i did .
you know , some people , it &apos;s like ...
the air weighs more for them ,
pushes them down , wears them out .
and your mother ...
she was like that .
and then she fell .
there &apos;s a big difference between falling and being pushed .
i &apos;ve seen the roof .
you don &apos;t think she jumped , do you ?
doctors can experience denial , too .
did she have any trouble with any of the other patients ?
who on the staff , aside from you , did she talk to ?
did she have any visitors ?
she loved you , toby .
she hated being away from you .
but there were forces ... just too much for her .
forces . people ?
did she ever mention any names ?
as i said ,
the air , it just got too heavy for her .
i mean , that &apos;s a real problem .
the air , it &apos;s just to heavy for them .
i &apos;m studying that now .
studying ... what ?
the heaviness of air .
i &apos;ve made it my life &apos;s work .
there are too many good people
being crushed by the heaviness of air .
how long have you been working here , dr. palmer ?
oh , well , they let me , um , do some research here ,
but i &apos;m not formally affiliated with the staff .
but you live here , don &apos;t you ?
ye @-@ yes .
yes , i live here .
are you sure you won &apos;t have a macaroon ?
oh , no . thank you .
sorry i bothered you .
no . it-- it &apos;s no bother .
it &apos;s always nice to have visitors .
come back , all right ? but ...
bring your mother next time .
i &apos;d love to see her again .
yes , sir .
will you tell her to stay away from that girl ?
what girl ?
the girl !
that blond girl .
there &apos;s something wrong with the air around that one .
very troubling .
&quot; what &apos;s my suitcase doing down here ? &quot;
&quot; maybe mom brought it in from the barn ? &quot;
&quot; but why ? &quot;
&quot; what &apos;s in here ? &quot;
&quot; what the hell is this ? &quot;
no , it &apos;s just you , melissa .
just you and that mask .
now , where did it come from ?
is she gonna figure it out ?
yeah .
just give her a second . she &apos;s smart . very smart .
okay , work it out , melissa .
where could it have come from ?
who could have made it ?
good girl .
that &apos;s where it must have come from .
now what are you gonna do ?
come on .
em , your mother and i have cut you a lot of slack .
and now this injury sidelines you indefinitely .
and you still haven &apos;t told us
the whole truth about how it happened .
does it matter how it happened ?
it does matter !
it matters to us , and to family services .
those people think that
what happened to you happened in this house !
it didn &apos;t .
then where did it happen ? !
did somebody hurt you ?
no ! can you just trust me ?
this has nothing to do with trust !
this has to do with
what we have a right to know as your parents !
dad , don &apos;t shout .
you want us to trust you-- what about trusting us ?
you cut us out of everything that &apos;s going on ,
and suddenly the police think we hurt you ?
i tried to explain , okay ?
i talked to dr. vargas .
you talked to him ?
you are not to talk to that man !
emily , we &apos;re not done here !
look , i &apos;m sorry , okay ? ! i &apos;m really , really sorry !
there are other things that we need to talk about .
all right ? we have big changes that we have to deal with .
like where you &apos;re going to college ,
how we &apos;re going to pay .
honey , we can talk about that later .
i know i screwed up the scholarships if i can &apos;t swim .
well , i &apos;ll get another job . i &apos;ll get three .
emily , you &apos;ve been through more things
than anybody at your age should have to survive ,
but your mother and i thought it was over ,
and it &apos;s not , is it ?
is it ?
i don &apos;t know !
okay ? i don &apos;t know !
emily !
emily !
stop !
emily ! ! !
come back here this second , do you hear me ? !
we &apos;ve always been there for each other ,
been the one that the other needed ,
and i don &apos;t know , i guess you &apos;re right ,
i &apos;m out of my league .
what did your mom say when you were in her room ?
that she came back that night .
she left new york and she came to rosewood .
to meet wilden ?
i don &apos;t know , she wouldn &apos;t tell me .
i mean , why would she ask my dad for money ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe she was gonna pay wilden off .
or maybe she was gonna pay somebody--
to what , kill him ?
i didn &apos;t say that .
yeah , but you were thinking it .
no , i &apos;m thinking what other people might think .
hanna , did she say anything about the gun ?
hello , hanna .
hey .
we were hoping to talk to your mom .
uh , she &apos;s not here .
really ?
her car is out front .
yeah , you know what ? i actually drove it here .
one of the speakers was shorting out ,
so hanna &apos;s mom asked me to take a look .
caleb , right ?
yeah . yeah , that &apos;s right .
well , tell your mom ... we stopped by .
yeah .
yeah , i will .
so , i take it this is hector &apos;s place .
yep , in all its creepiness .
is that sack big enough for hector ?
no .
good .
okay , i want to follow melissa .
can you keep an eye on hector ?
yeah , sure . i &apos;ve had all of three martial arts lessons .
knock knock .
i &apos;m closed for business right now .
well , you probably should have locked your doors .
you told emily that you destroyed all of these .
i said i destroyed the mold . i kept the casting .
so you lied .
i didn &apos;t have the heart to destroy them .
i mean , look at her .
she &apos;s beautiful .
did alison ever come out here with anybody else ?
no . she was always alone .
except ...
except what ?
hey !
i want the rest of my money !
when i get paid , you get paid .
that was the deal . payment on delivery ,
minus the cost of the masks you wanted .
how much do you have right now ?
well , not what i owe you , that &apos;s for sure .
i &apos;ll take what you got and call it square .
give me the money !
i &apos;ll still pay you the rest when i get it .
what &apos;s the quickest way to route 30 from here ?
go around the lake , pick up limerick road ,
take 202 to the exton bypass .
and that was the last i saw of her .
did you see who was driving the car ?
bad angle .
when was this ?
that summer she disappeared .
hello , melissa .
you put that mask in my bag .
you followed me .
you can &apos;t run to your room right now . not this time .
we &apos;re not going anywhere until i get some answers .
when was the last time an answer made you any happier ?
were you on the halloween train ?
is that where you saw mona in the ali mask ?
it was mona .
that woman that was just here ,
that woman that left with the sack ...
she wanted to know about those .
i made her the same deal .
she traded her face for information ?
what did you tell her ?
less than i told you .
you know , you have a very interesting face .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna keep it , too .
you asked shana
where somebody could get a mask like that .
you wanted to know if alison came here and ordered it .
and i wanted to know when it was made .
before or after ali disappeared ?
don &apos;t tell me you haven &apos;t thought about it yourself .
that ali &apos;s still alive ? i have , but it &apos;s crazy !
crazier than anything else that &apos;s happened ?
melissa ... on the halloween train , did you try to kill me ?
that was wilden . we had the same costume .
showing up in the same outfit ? that must have been awkward .
why were you helping wilden ?
i wasn &apos;t helping him !
none of us helped him . we were afraid of him .
who &apos;s we ? the n.a.t. club ?
this isn &apos;t about some stupid club !
but there is a connection .
there is some overlap with the club and what happened to alison ,
and wilden was blackmailing you all because of it .
wilden wasn &apos;t that smart . somebody was telling him what to do .
so somebody told wilden to be on the train ,
to kill me and aria and anybody else who could figure it out .
i didn &apos;t know about hurting you until i was on the train .
because garrett showed up and
suddenly it became more important to kill him .
you could have warned us , melissa .
you knew , and you did nothing .
you don &apos;t understand ! you never understood !
i have been protecting you since it started !
since before it started !
so you sent jenna and shana to burn down the lodge ?
i didn &apos;t send them to hurt you .
i sent them to watch you .
watch us ? why ?
to find out who you were going to meet .
to find out if it--
if it was--
alison ?
jenna and shana didn &apos;t start the fire .

what do they have to do with this ?
how did you know them ?
why do you still think ali &apos;s alive ?

it will come apart in ways that you cannot even imagine .

it doesn &apos;t matter . she &apos;s gone .

her car &apos;s gone and she &apos;s not in the barn .
