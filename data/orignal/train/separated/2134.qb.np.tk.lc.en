bryan , it &apos;s amazing .
well , this trip &apos;s been a long time coming .
figured i &apos;d go big .
mom , can i have these jelly beans ?
if she gets jelly beans ,
then i &apos;m watching hot tub time machine 2 .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
nobody &apos;s gonna watch or eat anything .
we came to hawaii for a nice family vacation ,
not to sit in a hotel room ,
binging on candy and pay @-@ per @-@ view .
they &apos;re just restless from being on planes all day .
okay , look , tell you what .
why don &apos;t you take them down to the pool for some lunch ?
i &apos;ll unpack everything , bring down the suits .
we all go for a swim ? yeah ?
yeah .
all right .
whoa , come on , come on , come on .
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go .
yeah , finally .
you &apos;re a lock for dad of the year .
get out of here .
gee , thanks , dad . you &apos;re the best .
yeah , let &apos;s get some towels . oh , my god .
what did you forget ?
kill you ! why you did that ?
i &apos;m sorry !
what makes you the boss ? !
i love you !
i &apos;m sorry ! i l ... no ! i love you !
aah ... !
i &apos;m sorry !
you son of a gun .
no !
hey , hey , hey ! what the hell &apos;s going on here ?
thank god you &apos;re here .
you got to talk some sense into my cousin .
what are you doing ?
flippa decided to enter us into shrimpapalooza .
is that a real thing ?
oh @-@ oh , it &apos;s legit .
it &apos;s this shrimp cook @-@ off
that was started by one of the food blogs .
we win that , our yelp rating will explode .
well , that &apos;s great .
it sounds like it would be great for business , no ?
yeah , except the part he forgot to mention .
we &apos;re competing against choy .
sam choy ?
the sam choy , celebrity chef ?
and godfather of hawaiian cuisine .
and when we lose to him ,
it &apos;s gonna kill our rep and my business .
listen to me , you &apos;re losing to a local culinary legend ,
there &apos;s no shame in that .
bruddah , read the sign .
no one &apos;s gonna eat second best shrimp .
ugh , i &apos;m gonna kill you .
is that gonna solve ... gonna solve anything ?
huh ?
it won &apos;t .
but it gonna feel real good .
listen , i might know somebody who can help .
but do you think you can refrain
from murdering flippa while i make a call ?
yeah .
can i mess him up just a little bit ?
no .
no !
clear a path .
get out of the way .
get out of the way !
vic &apos;s name is bryan wallace .
just got here from grand rapids , michigan .
15 minutes after he checks in the hotel ,
gets shot at point @-@ blank range .
any witnesses ?
no , not yet .
his family was at the pool when the whole thing happened .
from what we can make of it , it just looks like a robbery .
well , according to the wife ,
the only suitcase that &apos;s missing is the husband &apos;s carry @-@ on .
what was in it ?
she doesn &apos;t know .
she says it &apos;s the only bag she didn &apos;t pack herself .
okay , so our shooter ignores all these valuables ,
grabs what he came for , and then just takes off .
clearly , he was after something that our victim brought with him ,
and he was willing to kill for it .
the question is-- what ?
we &apos;ve been taking statements
from anyone who was in or around the lobby
at the time of the shooting .
so far , no one recalls seeing anyone suspicious .
okay , what about security cameras ?
got my best guy poring through the footage as we speak .
great .
officer kai ,
back in the saddle .
i told gene here i used to work this gig over at the marriott .
he was kind enough to let me take the wheel .
well , you still got the touch , i see .
indeed , i do .
but , full disclosure ,
your window of opportunity has finally closed .
i &apos;ve been in an exclusive relationship for three weeks .
really ?
hmm , well , who &apos;s the lucky girl ?
her name is brenda .
met her at a karaoke bar .
my rendition of &quot; love is a battlefield &quot; ? closed the deal .
bold choice .
i &apos;m sure you hit those high notes .
check out this suitcase .
yeah , that matches the description of our stolen bag .
can you punch in on those tags ?
sure .
flight 27 out of gerald ford .
that &apos;s the same flight our victim flew in on .
then that &apos;s our shooter .
yeah , we still need to i.d. him .
can you pull every angle we have on this guy ?
you got it , sistah .
just heard from the hospital .
the bullet &apos;s lodged inches away from wallace &apos;s heart .
he &apos;s in surgery now , but it &apos;s pretty much touch and go .
well , let &apos;s hope he pulls through .
so i had tsa send over the x @-@ ray of our stolen bag .
it was scanned right before
wallace boarded his flight in grand rapids .
what do we got ?
some clothes , toiletries , couple of magazines .
that &apos;s hardly anything worth shooting somebody over .
which means there &apos;s something here that we &apos;re not seeing .
or maybe this ain &apos;t about the bag .
you think this robbery might be a smoke screen for a hit ?
yeah , it could be .
here we are talking about a suitcase
instead of asking who might want wallace dead .
well , maybe that &apos;s the question we need to ask .
森本现代日式餐厅
don &apos;t think this is a good plan , brah .
it &apos;s the only one we got .
steve mcgarrett . how are you ? konnichi wa .
konnichi wa , chef morimoto .
konnichi wa , konnichi wa .
my friend , chef kamekona .
hi . konnichi wa .
oh , we just got fresh ono .
so you must stay for lunch .
i got to rain @-@ check today , chef .
but , i was kind of hoping you could do
my friend kamekona a favor .
right , well , you see , chef ,
i &apos;m competing in a shrimp cook @-@ off
and the competition is mad intense .
i &apos;m gonna really have to bring it to have a chance .
so we figured , who better to help me step up my game
than an actual iron chef .
oh , you want me to teach you how to cook ?
no .
i want you to teach me how to win .
be my sensei .
like mr. myagi in karate kid .
the movie ?
ralph macchio ?
yes , pat morita .
wax on . wax off .
yeah , paint the fence .
but i &apos;m not running cooking school .
so my answer is , sorry , no .
okay .
sorry , big guy . tried .
that &apos;s okay .
maybe he &apos;ll give me a job washing dishes
when we lose to choy .
choy ?
you said sam choy ?
yeah , sam choy , yeah .
he &apos;s , he &apos;s competing in the cook @-@ off .
okay , daniel @-@ san , i will train you .
and together we will destroy him , sam choy .
that &apos;s awesome .
chef , domo arigato . thank you .
arigato . hey , congratulations .
i &apos;ll leave you to it .
yeah , lou , what do you got ?
well , we looked into our vic , bryan wallace .
this guy sure picked a hell of a time
to go on a hawaiian vacation .
why ? what are you talking about ?
wallace lost his job as a consultant five months ago .
he hasn &apos;t collected a paycheck since .
wait a minute . if he &apos;s broke and out of work ,
what &apos;s he doing taking his family on an expensive trip ?
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
why would he keep something like that from me ?
the kids .
he promised them .
what did he promise them ?
this trip .
they &apos;ve been talking about coming to hawaii
ever since they saw it on one of their tv shows .
then last christmas ,
he promised to take them .
if he had told me what had happened with work ,
i would have made him cancel .
i just feel so terrible that he had to keep all this to himself .
ma &apos;am , that &apos;s not important right now .
the most important thing is that your husband gets through this
and he has you and your children to support him .
mrs.wallace , i promise you ,
we &apos;re gonna do everything we can to find out who did this , okay ?
thank you .
of course .
i &apos;m gonna go check with the doctors
to see if they have an update .
of course .
tell me something-- how do you keep your wife
in the dark about something like that ?
well , when the governor took my badge , i lost my job ,
i thought i was never gonna work again .
now , i went home and put a brave face on for renee and the kids ,
but , man ...
when you &apos;re alone late at night you think about the prospect
of not being able to take care of your family ,
you know what kind of a load that is to carry ?
pride , brother .
it is one of the seven deadlies .
makes you do things you otherwise wouldn &apos;t .
all right , so if wallace is capable of lying to his family ,
what else could he have been hiding ?
if i didn &apos;t know any better ,
i &apos;d say our shooter &apos;s camera @-@ shy .
all right , he definitely knew
where all the cameras were positioned
and was careful to avoid them .
that &apos;s every angle we have .
none of them caught an image of his face .
maybe this kid did .
hotel towel says he &apos;s probably a guest here .
thanks .
excuse me .
excuse me .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna need to see your phone .
i wasn &apos;t looking at those web sites .
i swear . my friend borrowed my cell .
that sounds like a reasonable defense .
look , i &apos;m only interested in the photos
that you took earlier in the lobby .
so , please , hand it over .
i &apos;ll tell you what .
i &apos;ll trade you .
for what ?
my homeboys are gonna flip
when i send them this .
okay , i ever see that photo online ,
you &apos;re spending the rest of your puberty behind bars .
kono , what do you got ?
an i.d. on our shooter .
he &apos;s a belgian national
named lukas janssen . interpol has him connected
to a string of high @-@ end robberies throughout europe .
well , how did our vic get mixed up with a guy like that ?
he didn &apos;t . he just shared a connecting flight with him .
janssen was coming in from antwerp
and he just happened to be seated
next to the entire wallace family .
but this is where it gets really interesting , though :
while the plane &apos;s in the air ,
tsa gets word that
lukas is smuggling stolen artwork into hawaii .
but when he lands , they don &apos;t find anything .
so they let him go .
and then , less than an hour later ,
janssen shoots bryan wallace
in his hotel room and takes only one thing :
a carry @-@ on suitcase that was stored in the airplane &apos;s cabin--
a suitcase that he had access to throughout the entire flight .
all right , janssen must have suspected
they were gonna search him when he landed .
so janssen slips whatever
he &apos;s smuggling into wallace &apos;s bag ,
tracks the guy down at his hotel ,
shoots him , and then gets his bag back .
well , it looks like wallace &apos;s luck just went from bad to worse .
nicole booth ?
yes .
steve mcgarrett .
this is captain lou grover .
ma &apos;am .
i understand you called tsa
with the tip about lukas janssen .
that &apos;s right . my firm chartered a flight
as soon as we heard that he was en route .
thank you .
wait a minute . you &apos;re an insurance agent ?
recovery specialist . and if you don &apos;t mind ,
i &apos;d like to see janssen right now .
that &apos;s going to be a little difficult .
we don &apos;t have him .
what do you mean ?
janssen got past tsa
by hiding whatever he was smuggling
in another passenger &apos;s bag .
now that passenger &apos;s in surgery ,
fighting for his life .
unfortunately , this isn &apos;t just about a piece of stolen art .
we &apos;re investigating an attempted murder .
look , i &apos;m sorry to hear that ,
but with all due respect , i &apos;m working a case , too .
and if i don &apos;t recover that piece ,
it &apos;s going to cost my firm $ 55 million .
what did this guy steal ?
vincent van gogh &apos;s vase with irises .
it was stolen from the bremen museum in 2012 .
bishop &amp; copley insurance
holds the policy and is on the hook
for the full value .
all right , well , according to interpol ,
janssen was investigated for the heist ,
but never charged .
this guy is meticulous in both planning and in execution .
i mean , short of catching him in the act ,
your only chance to nail him is
when he surfaces to unload the artwork .
which is exactly why janssen &apos;s here .
okay , wait a minute .
if this was stolen three years ago ,
why &apos;s he only moving it now ?
the hardest part in trafficking art
isn &apos;t just stealing a painting ;
it &apos;s converting it into cash .
especially when you &apos;re dealing with a van gogh .
i mean , there &apos;s only a handful of potential buyers
for a piece like that .
but it just so happens that the wealthiest
collectors in the world
are gathered here in hawaii this week .
the pacific art forum .
it &apos;s a big international art event
they hold in honolulu every year .
and where the legitimate art world gathers ,
there &apos;s a black market that travels with it .
so janssen &apos;s just following the money .
all right . how does he go about finding a buyer ?
very carefully .
these transactions occur in the shadows .
buyers and sellers communicate through back channels ,
often using a middleman to broker the deal .
so we find the middleman ,
we find janssen .
why don &apos;t i get a list of attendees at the convention
and run it against the fbi &apos;s art crime database ?
why bother ?
the guy that we want isn &apos;t in any criminal database .
gerard hirsch .
see , on paper he &apos;s clean .
a respected art appraiser .
but to insiders ,
he &apos;s a black market facilitator ,
dealing in stolen art and high @-@ end forgeries .
he &apos;s also a notorious perv .
good . we &apos;ll be able to get some leverage on him .
we just need some bait .
oh , no .
威斯汀莫阿纳冲浪者酒店
lot 16 from 1888 ...
i must say , you two clean up nicely .
the bentley was a nice touch , as well .
asset forfeiture , my dear .
they make the best loaners .
$ 2.3 million . thank you .
at $ 2.3 million now .
lloyd &apos;s bid at $ 2.3 million .
not yours , mr. park . at $ 2,300,000 .
it &apos;s brilliant , isn &apos;t it ?
it perfectly embodies the ideals of neo @-@ spatialism ,
while simultaneously critiquing
the commercialization of the movement .
i take it this isn &apos;t just a hobby for you ?
what gave me away ?
gerard hirsch . appraisals .
naomi lin . acquisitions .
$ 2.5 million .
$ 2,550,000 .
how about two @-@ six ? $ 2.6 million ?
$ 2,650,000 ?
thank you .
now , there &apos;s a man who knows what he wants .
tell me about it .
he &apos;s my boss .
oh , your boss has ...
excellent taste .
well , perhaps .
but , um , to him , art is just a commodity .
something you buy high and sell higher .
shame not to be appreciative of what you ...
have .
actually , you know , if you wouldn &apos;t mind ,
there is , uh , something
i &apos;d love to get your eyes on .
look at her . she &apos;s reeling him right in .
at $ 3 million ...
what do you mean , i &apos;m not on the list ?
who is that guy ?
of course i &apos;m on the list .
give me that . see ? i &apos;m right there .
you gotta be kidding me .
$ 3.1 million . $ 3,200,000 .
hey , kono ...
what are you doing here ?
uh , researching my book on the cia &apos;s use
of art sales to covertly fund a moon colonization project .
why ? what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m working a case .
oh , i see , undercover .
looking good , commander .
nicole , this is jerry .
nicole booth .
bishop &amp; copley insurance .
really , bishop &amp; copley ?
wow , oh , you must have worked the pordenone case .
yes , i did .
well , if you have time later ,
i &apos;d love to interview you for my book .
yeah , maybe .
lock your bidder at $ 3,350,000 .
oh , looks like he took the bait .
it &apos;s the pressure .
it &apos;s affecting my game .
problem is , you are cooking from here .
you should be cooking from here .
to be your best ,
you must search within yourself .
rediscover your passion .
that &apos;s heavy .
tell me-- who did you train under ?
trigger mike .
i &apos;m not familiar with chef trigger mike .
i should hope not .
he ran the mess up at halawa correctional .
gave me my first job in a kitchen .
i became pretty good at it , too .
my butter shrimp were so famous ,
the night guards used to sneak in the fresh catch .
i used to grill &apos; em up in my cell on a hot plate
that ran off a car battery .
some of the best meals i ever cooked .
show me that .
hai .
this is how you will beat choy .
now we just work on your technique .
i picked it up in san miguel last week .
the seller clearly underestimated its collectability .
you can tell more about a painting &apos;s provenance
by looking at its back .
gallery labels ,
the patina of the frame ,
even the nails used to secure the canvas ...
they all tell a story .
and what story does this tell you ?
unfortunately , that this piece is a forgery .
albeit a very good one .
i spent $ 80,000 of company money on this piece .
you &apos;re telling me it &apos;s worthless ?
i &apos;m sorry .
you could go after the seller ,
but i &apos;m guessing he demanded payment in cash .
if that &apos;s the case , then he &apos;s long gone .
my boss is going to fire me .
if he doesn &apos;t kill me first .
i may have a solution to your problem .
please .
i &apos;ll do anything .
i could write up an appraisal ,
vouching for the piece &apos;s authenticity .
that way , you can unload it at auction .
and your problem becomes ...
well , someone else &apos;s problem .
i am so glad that you said that .
five @-@ o ! gerard hirsch ,
get your hands where i can see &apos; em !
what is this ?
your problem . and it &apos;s a big one .
we got you on conspiracy to commit fraud .
and once the fbi starts looking into
every sale you &apos;ve ever touched ,
who knows how many more counts you &apos;ll be facing ?
the only way to help yourself now is by helping us .
meet tom emery .
according to hirsch ,
he &apos;s one of the biggest buyers of stolen art in the world .
and he &apos;s holding a private party today
at his kahala mansion
to show off his collection .
and add to it .
apparently , this party is known among insiders to be
the place to buy and sell stolen artwork .
a stolen art swap meet ?
seems like a good place to unload a hot van gogh .
janssen will be there , guaranteed .
all right , i want us inside that party when janssen shows up .
security &apos;s gonna be tight .
no one &apos;s gonna be allowed in there
without being vetted first .
but thankfully , hirsch is on the guest list ,
and he &apos;s willing to vouch for chin and me .
all right , that &apos;s good .
grover and i are gonna lead the entry team .
as soon as you guys give us word
that janssen is on site , we &apos;ll move in .
i &apos;ll notify swat .
i &apos;ll find something to wear .
hey , jerry .
shh . don &apos;t say my name .
just be cool and meet me in the hallway .
jerry , what &apos;s this ?
when i got home , i checked my research
and i realized i made a mistake .
a mistake about what ?
bishop &amp; copley .
the insurance company nicole claims to work for .
it turns out they did not handle the pordenone case .
well , then why didn &apos;t she correct you
when you said they did ?
maybe because she &apos;s not who she says she is .
just hang on a minute , and i can explain .
what &apos;s there to explain ? i know who you are .
you &apos;re a bounty hunter who tracks down
lost and stolen pieces of art for massive rewards .
and based on the warrants out for your arrest
in athens and budapest ,
it &apos;s clear you don &apos;t have a problem bending the law .
look , this isn &apos;t just a payday for me , all right ?
i track these pieces down ,
and i return them to their rightful owners .
so what if i have to bend the rules sometimes ?
hey , bryan wallace is laying in a hospital room
right now fighting for his life .
and while i &apos;ve been out there trying
to catch the guy who put him there ,
you &apos;ve been lying to me .
the really crazy part is
i still need your help .
there &apos;s dozens of artworks and buyers
who need to be i.d.ed.
see , here &apos;s the deal .
we get janssen .
you get to return the van gogh and collect the reward .
the whole $ 1.5 million of it .
girl &apos;s got to eat , right ?
yeah , well , flying private can &apos;t be cheap , either .
look , thank you , really .
i promise i &apos;ll be up front moving forward ,
and help any way i can , really .
all right , good .
you &apos;re not gonna be working alone , either .
you should know that .
you mad at me for outing you ?
no , i &apos;m just enjoying the pungent aroma
of those chips you &apos;re eating .
mango habanero .
got to stay fueled up on these long stakeouts .
oh , by the way ,
if nature calls , i got you covered .
put that away .
that &apos;s disgusting .
all right , guys .
all right , heads up .
our guys just landed .
thank you .
i ordered some spyglasses off the back of a comic book once .
not as cool as these .
mr. hirsch ?
mr. park , ms. lin .
thank you . enjoy the event .
entry team , stand by .
players on set .
running facial rec .
should have a guest list for you shortly .
chin , you got any sign of the subject ?
negative .
guys , none of these paintings
are coming up as stolen .
something ain &apos;t right here .
here comes our host now .
tom .
this is mr. park .
ms. lin .
i hear you had quite the haul today .
did you bid on the richter ?
unsuccessfully , i &apos;m afraid .
frozen out at $ 7 million .
there &apos;s always that one that gets away .
i suppose i &apos;ll have to find a way to spend
my money here today .
well , then , why don &apos;t i show you
where we keep the good stuff ?
holy mother lode .
oh , my god .
wait . those paintings were stolen
from the himerman in &apos; 72 .
and that piece is from the doscher heist .
i &apos;m told it &apos;s human nature to want what you cannot have .
thankfully , i wouldn &apos;t know .
this is quite the collection .
i &apos;d ask how you put it together ,
but i &apos;m guessing you &apos;d rather not say .
discretion is key .
but what &apos;s the point in owning
something so rare and expensive
if you cannot show it off to your friends ?
if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have some business to attend to .
we got eyes on the subject .
janssen is here .
all right , move , move !
all right , entry team , get ready to roll !
we have subject is on the move .
emery &apos;s taking janssen into the office .
looks like they &apos;re about to make a deal for the ...
chin , say again your last .
chin ?
kono ?
jerry ?
jerry , we lost chin and kono .
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i suddenly lost cell service .
yeah , me , too .
someone &apos;s using a signal jammer .
move !
on the floor right now !
down ! down ! on the floor !
on the floor !
everybody down !
if it wasn &apos;t already obvious ,
this is a robbery .
just watched the steps in parimeter .
every entry point in the house is locked down .
got to be a way to breach .
not without calling a lot of attention to yourself ,
and that endangers the hostages .
you guys see what &apos;s happening here , right ?
janssen &apos;s trading up .
the van gogh was just his way in the door
so that he could boost emery &apos;s collection .
yeah , and judging from the gunfire ,
he &apos;s got at least four or five accomplices with him
all armed with automatic weapons .
i don &apos;t get it . we had eyes on the place .
every guest was checked going in .
how did he get a bunch of guys in there with guns ?
better question is :
how is he planning on getting out ?
after that alarm went off ,
this place became as impenetrable as the dreadfort .
what ?
game of thrones ?
anyone ?
okay , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about ,
but i do know that this is all by design .
if the alarm went off , it &apos;s because janssen wanted it to .
and you can be certain that he &apos;s got an exit strategy .
well , the guy &apos;s best card is the hostages .
maybe he &apos;s gonna play that to negotiate .
yeah , and if he finds out that chin and kono are cops ,
they &apos;re the first ones he &apos;s gonna try to leverage .
i could reach out to my contacts
at the security companies .
if we can track down the schematics ,
there may be a way that we could remotely override the alarm .
that &apos;s smart . okay , thank you , nicole .
listen . even if swat could breach this place right now ,
i wouldn &apos;t make the call .
not without knowing where the hostages were ,
how many shooters we got in there .
we &apos;d just be going in there blind .
jerry , there &apos;s got to be someway we can
reestablish communication with chin and kono .
well , theoretically speaking , i suppose
there is a way to crash a signal jammer .
okay . if i could tap into
the blocking frequency ...
jerry , jerry ,
i don &apos;t , i don &apos;t care how you do it . i just need you to do it .
okay ? can you do it now ?
copy that .
get in there ! everybody on the floor . nobody move .
be quiet .
hpd &apos;s response time was supposed to be four minutes ,
yet the cops already have the place surrounded .
but the only way that &apos;s possible is if they were tipped off
before the alarm was triggered .
yeah , find out how .
holy crap !
i did it !
all right , jerry , i got the feed up here .
patch me through to their comms .
you got it .
please hold for steve mcgarrett .
go ahead .
all right , guys .
just listen to me and don &apos;t say anything .
we don &apos;t want to draw any attention to ourselves .
kono , nod if all the hostages are okay .
good .
all right , chin ,
i need you to show me the shooters
and where they &apos;re positioned .
all right , stand by , guys .
we &apos;ve got six threats all armed with steyr machine pistols .
three at the north end of the room watching the hostages ,
the other three packing up the artwork .
i &apos;ll have swat ready as soon as we can make entry .
all right , please tell me you got the schematics .
i did . there &apos;s something here i need you to see .
this is the office ,
which doubles up as a fortified panic room
when emery needs to be holed up inside the house .
but here &apos;s where he takes his paranoia to the next level .
this is a tunnel .
as in an escape tunnel .
wait a minute . janssen was in the office
when the alarm was tripped .
that tunnel is how he and his boys got into this house .
and that &apos;s how he &apos;s gonna take the art out .
we have a problem .
the police took out our signal jammer .
collect everyone &apos;s phones ,
and make sure they are turned off .
already done .
i &apos;m still showing a signal .
only it &apos;s radio , not cellular .
and it &apos;s coming from inside the house .
we &apos;ve got cops in here .
all right , this is the mouth of the tunnel--
it &apos;s about 200 yards from here .
this is where we &apos;re gonna be positioned .
all right , once we detain janssen and his men
and get them out of there , then we go back in
and we secure the hostages-- copy ?
guys ?
it &apos;s jerry .
we got a problem .
jerry , what &apos;s in his hand ?
signal finder .
he &apos;s looking for an outgoing frequency .
yeah , it &apos;s them .
you two ...
hand over your earpieces .
i &apos;m still registering a signal .
if anyone tries coming in here ,
your people die first .
all right , hpd and emergency personnel are staying put
to help secure the hostages .
all right , nobody moves until janssen
and his men are all in cuffs .
i &apos;m not gonna put chin and kono at any more risk .
all right , gentlemen ,
we got six hostiles about to poke their heads out
and get a nasty surprise .
any of them tries to engage you , you light that ass up .
ladies and gentlemen ,
i &apos;m afraid this ...
is where we say good @-@ bye .
au revoir .
everybody , get back from the bag .
get back .
close to the walls .
it &apos;s locked .
the gallery is hermetically sealed .
the doors only open from outside .
oh , i know that look .
all right , what &apos;s going on ?
janssen &apos;s been three steps ahead of us this whole time .
all right , he eluded tsa .
he made us think this was about a sale ,
when it was actually about a heist .
he even used the alarm system
to his advantage by locking us out .
it ain &apos;t checkers ; it &apos;s chess . i get that ,
but what do you think his next move is gonna be ?
i don &apos;t know , but if janssen can get his hands on those security schematics ,
that man is smart enough to know that we can , too .
if anyone tries coming in here ,
your people die first .
do you want to tell me what you &apos;re doing ?
you see that ?
see what ?
there , check it out .
the shooters are all wearing patent leather shoes .
guys , you better get back here .
for what ?
&apos;cause janssen &apos;s not coming out that tunnel .
he &apos;s going out the front door .
move out ! move out !
load up ! load up !
shut it down .
steady . steady .
stand fast .
repeat , stand fast .
everyone , stay calm .
everybody close your eyes and cover your mouth !
and stay low !
door &apos;s open !
move toward the door !
go !
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go !
go , go !
come on , let &apos;s go !
hold your fire !
hold your fire !
paramedics , get in here !
these people need medical attention . come on .
all right , come on , folks .
come on , this way .
hey , cuff this guy .
and you , keep your nose clean .
thanks !
freeze ! drop your weapon !
steve , cover me !
lukas janssen !
get them up !
get your hands up .
you &apos;re under arrest for attempted murder ,
armed robbery and a whole bunch of other stuff .
get up here .
what happened ?
what happened ?
you just caught the bad guy . that &apos;s what happened .
where &apos;s nicole ?
i &apos;m here .
i know i said i &apos;d help any way i can ,
but i &apos;m not suicidal .
let &apos;s go .
you all right ?
need an ambulance or something ?
huh ? yeah , you know me .
i just got to walk it off .
thank you for keeping your word .
i know you guys could &apos;ve easily returned this yourselves .
well , if law enforcement weren &apos;t barred from collecting cash rewards ,
you &apos;d be going home empty @-@ handed right now .
well , it was lovely working with you .
you , too . i &apos;m glad we both got what we wanted .
bye .
bye .
oh , wait .
i forgot to ask ,
how &apos;s bryan wallace doing ?
he &apos;s doing okay .
the doctors say he should make a full recovery .
i &apos;m glad to hear it .
i hope his luck changes soon .
i &apos;ll tell him .
hello .
steve , it &apos;s chin .
i just got word from the fbi
that the paintings we recovered were all fakes .
what ?
how &apos;s that possible ?
well , according to tom emery ,
those paintings were all decoys and the real ones are stored
in a vault inside his house .
whoa , hold on .
jerry had the security schematics .
why didn &apos;t we know about the vault ?
because nicole conveniently omitted that one page from the file .
well , there &apos;s only one reason she &apos;d do that .
like i said , girl &apos;s got to eat , right ?
i &apos;ll make sure the pieces get back to their rightful owners .
as for the van gogh ,
please see that the reward goes to someone deserving .
i don &apos;t understand .
what kind of person would just give us this kind of money ?
somebody who figured you were due for some good luck .
i &apos;ve got to say , jerry , you &apos;ve helped us out before ,
but you took it from , like , a four to an 11 on this one .
thank you .
yeah , i think hanging out with steve is ,
uh , having an effect on you .
oh , yeah , driving head @-@ on into a suspect ,
vintage mcgarrett .
now that i have sustained bodily injury for you guys ,
you think i can get that badge ?
no , but to show our appreciation ,
lunch is on me today .
this isn &apos;t lunch .
and besides , it &apos;s free .
right , and as for now , so are your services .
you brought your own bib ?
it &apos;s hardly my first rodeo .
trust me , when the grinds start coming fast and furious ,
you &apos;re gonna be wishing you had one of these babies .
watch your sauté work .
don &apos;t get sloppy with the presentation , okay ?
just want to wish you good luck
and say hello to an old friend here .
hi , sam . good to see you .
so how &apos;s the family ? everything is good ?
yeah , carol and the boys are doing great .
we &apos;ve actually been spending a lot more time back here
since i opened the new place .
you know , after i signed the contract ,
i heard you were eyeing up the same spot .
i hope there &apos;s no hard feelings .
please .
i &apos;m just happy with your success .
good to be catching up .
good luck .
hey , can &apos;t wait to taste your food .
we must crush him .
i don &apos;t think i can do this .
of course you can .
you are a shrimp samurai .
all right ... yeah !
all right , all right , all right .
that &apos;s right ! yeah !
and the winner of the first annual shrimpapalooza cook @-@ off ...
kamekona tupuola !
congratulations .
awesome .
chef , thank you . domo arigato .
i don &apos;t know what you taught him ,
but whatever you taught him , it helped .

sansho .
special japanese pepper .
very , very spicy .
i didn &apos;t taste anything spicy at all
in kamekona &apos;s dish .
of course not .
it was not in his dish .
it was in choy &apos;s dish .
cooking is combat ,
