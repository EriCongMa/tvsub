whoever tipped me in monopoly money
can go directly to jail .
a dollar ?
fake money and they &apos;re still under @-@ tipping .
oh , look . i love it when people
dress guinea pigs up in adorable costumes .
han , you look like babe ruth .
well , baby ruth .
maybe you two can kiss my sweet ass ,
because this outfit &apos;s a home run .
i &apos;m putting a team together for the restaurant league .
well , han , i would play , but you know ,
i &apos;ve got this hip thing ,
meaning , i &apos;m too hip .
what about you two ?
i &apos;m telling you , i &apos;m a great ball player .
no , i &apos;m a great ball player .
i know how to cup
and tickle mine at the same time .
i &apos;m talking about america &apos;s favorite pastime .
oh , so am i.
well , i &apos;m in . i have a really good arm .
go over there , han . let &apos;s have a little catch .
all right , here we go . all right .
go deep . go deeper , han .
a phrase no other woman will ever say to him .
throw it , and don &apos;t be afraid to bring the heat .
too much heat .
ball one ... and two . game over .
i seem to have forgotten a crucial part of my uniform .
need a cup , han ?
you ladies can wait in here .
brian , before my father comes in ,
how are his spirits ?
you know , for someone who &apos;s looking
at 60 to 100 years in prison ?
pretty good .
i &apos;ll bring him right in .
hey , bri , anyone get killed today ?
you ask me that every time , max ,
and every time i tell you ,
it &apos;s a white collar prison .
got it . anyone get shanked with a mont blanc pen ?
yo , b , one more thing .
on lock up : raw , they always spray the guards
with a mixture of urine and feces , so--
max , please , can we go one day without you mentioning that ?
i wonder why my dad wanted us
to rush out here and see him today .
he probably wants a conjugal visit .
max !
relax !
with me .
there they are , the light of my life
and her bouncer .
hi , daddy .
hey . max .
oh , we startin &apos; this ? no foreplay ?
listen , i &apos;m sorry to make you come all the way out here
on the--god help me--subway ,
but i actually need a favor .
help me break out .
i &apos;m kidding .
daddy , it &apos;s so amazing you can joke ,
but maybe not around max .
she &apos;s already offered to skin a guard alive
and walk you out of here wearing him .
well , we know it works .
all right , listen .
this woman who used to work for me
is being paid a million dollars
to write a tell @-@ all book about me .
a million dollars ?
how much can i get for a tell @-@ all book about caroline ?
chapter one : &quot; sleep farts . &quot;
max , please , can we go one day without you mentioning that ?
the woman &apos;s name is sandra rosenthal .
caroline , do you remember her ?
yes , the one who lied on her resume .
the one who couldn &apos;t even add , and worse than that ,
she wore brown with black together .
i like brown and black together .
i know .
wait , why would anybody pay that woman so much ?
what is she saying she has on you ?
well , she &apos;s claiming she was fired
because she had insider information
about the ponzi scandal ,
and that we were sleeping together ,
which we weren &apos;t .
of course you weren &apos;t .
you would never sleep with someone
who wore brown with black together .
man , i haven &apos;t seen this much hatred
toward brown and black since the &apos; 50s .
anyway , i wanted you to hear it from me first ,
because she &apos;s about to go on piers morgan live ,
and she can say whatever she wants .
no , she can &apos;t , because i &apos;ll be there to refute her lies .
i &apos;ll defend you with dignity and class
and my new lipstick i just found on the subway .
wow , piers morgan . that dude &apos;s legit .
he &apos;s got a show , he &apos;s got piers 1 imports .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;d do without you , princess .
you &apos;re the only person i can trust .
now , get out of here ,
&apos;cause i gotta speak to max privately for a second .
oh ... sure .
okay , i--
just go .
daddy wants to talk to me privately .
love you , sweetie .
love you , daddy .
brian , i &apos;ll just be right outside .
so , max ...
you know i &apos;m all talk , right ?
i need you to tell caroline something
i couldn &apos;t bring myself to say .
this woman is also claiming
i have a small penis .
wait .
so i stayed behind to see it ?
no .
i want you to tell caroline so she &apos;ll be prepared ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s the lie
that got the book sold .
how big of a lie ?
oh , a really big one .
so , what did you and my father talk about ?
i don &apos;t want to tell you . i &apos;m uncomfortable .
you &apos;re uncomfortable ?
this must be bad .
you &apos;ve never been uncomfortable in your life .
is it drugs ? cancer ?
oh ! did he fall in love in prison ?
i &apos;ll be fine with it . you can tell me .
when we had money , i was very active in the park avenue
straights for gay doormen alliance .
is this some kind of weird gang ,
or did a game just let out ?
max , come on . tell me .
fine , the woman &apos;s gonna say your father has a small--
sir , your vuvuzela is very loud , and very 2010 .
my father has a what ?
he has a small--
seriously , the game &apos;s over .
and how on earth you have a wedding ring is beyond me .
what is she gonna say about him ?
i can &apos;t hear you !
she &apos;s going to say ...
your father has a small penis !
he thought it &apos;d be less awkward if i told you .
was it ?
i can &apos;t believe that sandra rosenthal woman .
there &apos;s another lie .
why , have you seen it ?
no , i haven &apos;t seen it !
i never want to see it .
have you seen your father &apos;s penis ?
if i did , it was waving good @-@ bye .
max , i &apos;ve thought a lot about it ,
and i can &apos;t sit there while that woman
waves my father &apos;s penis in piers morgan &apos;s face .
you &apos;re lucky it &apos;s not anderson cooper ,
&apos;cause he &apos;d be giggling up a storm .
i have a plan .
my goal on this show is gonna be to discredit that woman
and tell people , even though my father did a bad thing ,
he did some wonderful things as well .
look , here he is working with unicef .
here he is rebuilding haiti .
oh , this is just a cute picture of him water @-@ skiing
at a charity event on lake tahoe .
what &apos;s the charity ? white men without golf clubs ?
so that &apos;s my plan , and hopefully ,
going on that show will put an end
to all these ridiculous rumors about my father .
hey , caroline .
yeah .
the word on the street is your dad &apos;s got a weenis .
sophie , how did you hear about that ?
oleg told me .
it came up on my google penis alerts .
i like to keep current , see what the trends are .
you don &apos;t want to be that middle @-@ aged guy
wearing the same penis you had in high school .
great , now , it &apos;s all over the internet
and my shoulders are all up around my ears .
look , i &apos;m too tense to even shake my head &quot; no &quot;
at that liar woman , which was gonna be my key move .
i need a massage , but i &apos;m broke .
caroline , i &apos;ll give you a massage .
get ready for a sad ending .
and beginning , and middle .
there .
oh , yeah .
how does that feel ?
like baby spiders are dancing on my shoulders .
you &apos;re the first asian i &apos;ve seen
that can &apos;t give a massage .
hey , caroline , i &apos;ll treat you and max
to a massage at my fancy spa .
cool ! i &apos;ve never been to a spa .
the closest i &apos;ve been is sticking my arm
in the free blood pressure machine at walgreens .
wait , that &apos;s for your arm ?
thanks for the massage , han .
it was very nice-- oh , you &apos;re still doing it .
i had no idea .
that was a @-@ mazing !
i mean , a guy rubbed me for an hour
and didn &apos;t expect anything back ?
this massage stuff could catch on .
i could not let go during my massage .
oh , was letting go an option ?
i was close , but i didn &apos;t want to get halfway there
and have the management throw me out or something .
i &apos;m just so tense .
piers morgan asks some difficult questions .
last week , he asked the spring breakers cast
their thoughts on the north korea situation .
sorry .
max , this is a quiet room . we have to be quiet .
hi , girls !
oh , i &apos;m getting myself some fancy water .
look , they got lemon , orange , and cucumber .
it &apos;s like a slot machine over here .
oh , i just had the best bamboo massage .
oh , they kept whacking me with it
until i confessed to stealing that bread when i was seven .
oh , what a load off .
caroline , you still look a little tense ,
but i guess having to talk about your father &apos;s junk
on national television will do that to a girl .
i will not be speaking about
my father &apos;s &quot; junk &quot; on television .
no , i can &apos;t have lunch tomorrow .
i &apos;m doing piers morgan live .
you won &apos;t believe what just happened .
you joined a demonic cult ?
sandra , the liar writing the tell @-@ all book ,
just walked in .
she &apos;s getting a day of beauty too ?
this is like the gayest training for a fight ever .
sandra ?
right this way .
lay face down .
i &apos;ll give you a few minutes and i &apos;ll be right back in .
perfect . i really need this massage .
promoting my new book is exhausting .
i &apos;m sorry if that sounded braggy ,
but i guess that &apos;s how you sound
when things are going so great for you .
that poor masseuse is gonna be forced to listen to
her yammer on about her dumb book .
but then again , mine had to hear me constantly say ,
&quot; don &apos;t be afraid of the boobs . &quot;
we should be hearing about that dumb book
so i know what i &apos;m up against .
if there was only a way to get in that room .
oh , anyone can get into any room if they really want to .
i mean , do you think that i was invited
to the audition for the 2004 boat show ?
yeah . go .
i &apos;ll take care of that masseuse .
sophie , you &apos;re not gonna hurt her , right ?
no . i &apos;m gonna try tipping her first .
i &apos;m back .
yes , i was just out in the hall with you ,
now , here i am in the room with you ,
the same person .
just keep your head down , don &apos;t look up ,
and relax .
you &apos;re not gonna talk a lot , are you ?
no , but you should feel free to .
whatever &apos;s on your mind or in in that book .
what ?
what was that ?
that ?
that &apos;s just me , alone ,
creating a healing space with energy and sound .
lots of sound .
so you &apos;re writing a big book .
do you want to tell me all about that ?
well , it &apos;s about this guy , martin channing .
oh , he is very nice and very respectable .
you won &apos;t think that after you read my book .
i am really gonna stick it to him .
okay , now , you &apos;re just pushing me .
uh , how did you--
uh ... how-- how did you do that ?
it feels like you have three hands .
that &apos;s how good i am .
this is supposed to be a hot stone massage .
comin &apos; right up .
the hot stones .
all right , here come the ho @-@ o @-@ ot stones .
oh , yeah . yeah , that &apos;s nice .
i &apos;m really loosening up .
oh , well , then let &apos;s loosen you up some more .
more stones .
more stones !
yeah , i &apos;m got paid a lot of money for my tell @-@ all book ,
and i am really gonna tell all .
not there ! not there .
what ? what is going on in here ?
well , what is happening here , sandra ,
is you &apos;re about to go on national tv
and tell america lies about my father .
he never slept with you .
did he never sleep with me in your bedroom ,
on your pink canopy bed ?
you know what ? that never happened .
that &apos;s insane . you &apos;re crazy .
well , it &apos;s my word against yours .
you &apos;re gonna be very embarrassed on tv .
but not as embarrassed as you &apos;re going to be in the spa lobby ,
when i tell everyone that i was touched inappropriately
by caroline channing .
you are not gonna tell anybody that .
who &apos;s gonna stop me ?
hey , girls .
i was listening outside the door .
everything okay ?
max , i don &apos;t know if i can do this .
what if sandra &apos;s telling the truth ?
she did know about my pink canopy bed .
how would she know that ?
because everyone knows barbie comes with a dream car ,
a pony , and a pink canopy bed included .
there he is . there &apos;s piers morgan , live .
do you think it &apos;s too soon to ask him
to give me a discount at piers 1 ?
he looks dignified , like he &apos;s not gonna ask about a penis .
but what if he does ?
max , i can &apos;t do this .
give me your phone .
you need to remind yourself
of the person your father used to be .
look , here he is working with unicef .
and here he is water @-@ skiing on &quot; lake rich person . &quot;
look at that smile . is that the smile of--hold up .
what &apos;s coming out of the left leg of his swim shorts ?
i think your father &apos;s junk is trying to tell me
there &apos;s gonna be six more weeks of winter .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying , someone had a tip slip ,
and that is not a small tip .
and as a waitress and a loose woman ,
i know a small tip when i see one .
here .
sorry , sorry .
she just showed me a picture of anne hathaway &apos;s new haircut .
well , this is good ,
because it can proves that woman is lying .
yep , you just have to show this to piers .
i told you , i &apos;m not going near my father &apos;s penis .
all i have to do is point out
that that woman has no finance skills .
unlike her , we are taking the high road .
max , are you sending that to yourself ?
i &apos;m here with sandra rosenthal ,
who &apos;s just signed a huge book deal
to do a kiss @-@ and @-@ tell
on disgraced financier martin channing .
welcome to you , sandra .
hello , piers .
thank you for allowing me to tell my story .
it &apos;s a story , all right .
wow , so we &apos;re right into it .
okay , well , let me catch up .
my other guest is caroline channing ,
daughter of martin channing , who , to put it mildly ,
is claiming that your book , ms. rosenthal ,
is a bunch of bull .
that &apos;s right , piers .
it &apos;s pure rubbish ,
as your people say .
that was perfectly american .
right , then , let me start with you .
well , to catch everybody up , ms. rosenthal &apos;s large book advance
really has to do with something that turned out to be ,
by your words , very small .
comments , ms. channing ?
i &apos;d rather not comment about that , piers ,
because i have class , but i do have a question
for ms. rosenthal , who was hired by my father
because she claimed she had a degree in finance .
ms. rosenthal , if a train carrying 27 passengers
leaves grand central station at 9 : 00 a.m. ,
travels 800 miles to chicago , arriving at 5 : 00 p.m. ,
how fast was it traveling ?
well , i--
simple math , piers .
100 miles an hour .
i &apos;m sorry ?
that &apos;s your answer .
sorry , i &apos;m a bit of a mathlete .
impressive .
i &apos;ve got a math equation for you .
if a 3 @-@ inch train is entering a tunnel ,
do i even know it &apos;s there ?
ladies , this isn &apos;t maury povich .
piers , i am simply trying to illustrate
that she should have been able to answer it ,
had she been qualified for her job in finance .
everything that i am writing in the book is true , piers .
there is nothing that i have said
that she can prove is untrue .
wait a minute , why is there a woman under my desk ?
oh , is there , piers ?
yes , my father defrauded a lot of people ,
and he &apos;s paying a price for that ,
but i &apos;m not gonna sit by silently while she exploits him
with lies for her own gain .
piers , there &apos;s so much about my father
i want you to know , like he--
what is this ?
well ... i know what this is .
i &apos;ve got one .
but whose is it , and why am i looking at it ?
it &apos;s my father &apos;s .
he had a bit of a tip slip .
madam , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re looking for in a man ,
but this ...
is far from inadequate .
in fact , it &apos;s so far from inadequate ,
that i &apos;m bringing this interview to an immediate close .
your book and you lack any credibility .
that &apos;s it .
&quot; can you hook me up with a discount at piers 1 imports ? &quot;
hey , you know , they &apos;ll probably come to you one day
and want a tell @-@ all book .
remember , we already have chapter one , &quot; sleep farts . &quot;
chapter two : &quot; my new stepmom max . &quot;
max , am i gonna have to defend my father forever ?
probably , but don &apos;t worry ,
i &apos;ll be there to help .
thank you .
&apos;cause it &apos;s a wife &apos;s job to defend her husband .
it makes me sad to think he &apos;s gonna be in prison
for the rest of his life .
don &apos;t think of it like that . he &apos;s not just in prison .
he &apos;s in africa working with unicef ,
he &apos;s in haiti ,
he &apos;s water @-@ skiing on &quot; lake rich person , &quot;
and he &apos;s on the desktop of my computer .
i should delete that .
where &apos;d i leave my phone ?
oh , god , are you guys looking at the picture of my dad ?
we are . respect .
so very much respect .
eh , i &apos;ve seen better .
every day .
give me that .
