mom ? mom , wake up .
i need help .
mom ?
we &apos;re fine , mom .
we just left dad &apos;s . what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
i just ... nothing .
checking in .
zach &apos;s driving safe .
no . i know . it &apos;s not it .
but tell zach not to get on the expressway .
mom says don &apos;t get on the expressway .
oh , your firm was on the radio .
what ? why ?
something about a white supremacist .
donald pike ?
donald pike .
he got some witness killed .
colin sweeney ?
no , no , it was just some witness .
uh , they were saying that your firm &apos;s involved with the case .
got to go . school .
we got to go , mom . love you .
okay , leave a note for me on the refrigerator
if you go anywhere after school , okay ?
i &apos;m not ready .
you are . you &apos;re fine .
it &apos;s my first time in court .
i know , but it &apos;s not court , it &apos;s arbitration .
it has a $ 35,000 cap .
the opposing lawyers will most likely go through the motions .
it &apos;s perfect to get your feet wet .
so , just present your case solidly , competently ,
and with as little fuss as possible , okay ?
okay .
oh , i think that &apos;s the other attorney .
she doesn &apos;t look too intimidating .
mrs. florrick .
hello .
martha . what a surprise .
so , that &apos;s who you hired instead of me ? is she good ?
she is .
well , she sure is blonde .
what pretty hair .
i &apos;m glad to see you landed somewhere , martha .
canning &amp; meyers seems like a perfect fit .
yes , with 20 % less salary .
because i thought i was going to be hired somewhere else .
i &apos;m not here to offer you life lessons , martha ,
but you &apos;re a little young to be holding a grudge .
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re not here to offer life lessons .
good luck .
good luck .
thank you .
do you know her ?
i do .
how confident do you feel about this case ?
pretty good .
remember when i told you to just give a solid performance ?
yeah .
forget it .
kick ass .
your cell phone is ringing , will .
it &apos;s alicia .
want me to give you some privacy ?
hello .
i missed it .
you know , one thing i &apos;ve always liked about you , diane ?
you never played games .
you think i &apos;m playing a game ?
i think you need to stop mothering .
i can take care of my life .
it &apos;s not your life when it impacts me .
your relationship with alicia impacts me .
the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office is no longer targeting drugs .
it &apos;s targeting you .
i know .
i heard peter put wendy scott @-@ carr
in charge of the investigation .
cary and dana lodge are still involved ,
but they answer to her .
but peter &apos;s still in charge , right ?
i don &apos;t know .
i need to know if ...
i need to know how personal this is .
if i made changes here ,
would the investigation go away ?
if you stopped being close with alicia ,
would that change things ?
i don &apos;t want that question asked .
i &apos;ll find out .
good .
anything we should worry about with this white supremacist
killing witnesses ?
donny pike ? no . we &apos;re fine .
no chance at retribution ?
that &apos;s unlikely .
good . thanks .
i need some access .
really ? you &apos;ve been wanting a lot of access these days .
okay , well , i may need some access of my own ,
so , i &apos;ll call you back .
kalinda ?
yup . she said to say hi .
no .
no ... ?
the budget &apos;s too high .
it isn &apos;t , peter .
we &apos;ve been very careful in analyzing
how long this investigation will take ,
how much investigator time .
and how long will it take ?
one year .
that sounds like you &apos;re losing your way .
peter , i &apos;m here because you asked me to be here .
you were worried that if you supervised this investigation ,
you would be tempted to go lightly on your wife &apos;s firm .
i applaud that ethical foresight .
now , if i go easier on your wife &apos;s firm ,
i won &apos;t be fulfilling the task you &apos;ve given me .
yes , but your task is not to create a new task .
i &apos;m looking into corruption at your wife &apos;s firm .
wendy , cook county , like the rest of the country ,
is going through a budget crisis .
you guys are just gonna have to live within your means .
you &apos;ve been given the steering wheel ,
but i still put the gas in the car .
we need a freelance investigator who &apos;s good and cheap .
they &apos;re all pretty tied up .
what about andrew wiley ?
who &apos;s that ?
good freelancer .
his wife &apos;s rich , so he doesn &apos;t need the money .
he &apos;s a friend of yours , isn &apos;t he , cary ?
he tends to go a bit free @-@ range , hard to control .
kind of like me ?
not editorializing , just describing .
well , let &apos;s meet your friend .
okay .
was it cicero who said , &quot; here i stand : a man ? &quot;
well , here we sit .
okay , you &apos;re all here
because you &apos;ve agreed to binding arbitration .
and that means the decision of the arbitrator--
and yes , we do say &quot; arbitrator , &quot; not to &quot; arbiter &quot; --
for those of you taking notes at home ...
the decision of the arbitrator ,
and that would be myself , is final .
are we all agreed on that ?
yes , mr. arbitrator .
oh , my goodness gracious .
you can sit back down .
we don &apos;t need to be so formal .
was it shaw-- george bernard shaw-- who said
that formality is a , um ...
not a , uh ...
not a good thing ?
so , shall we call the first witness ?
pamela raker .
i &apos;m a professor of english literature ...
actually , i was a professor of english literature
until i was fired in august .
and who fired you ?
mr. daniel clove ,
the provost here .
he told me he needed to downsize ,
but then he hired and promoted another english professor .
and why do you believe you were fired ?
objection . calls for speculation .
oh . first objection of the day .
and i &apos;m gonna sustain that .
why were you fired ... ?
objection .
again , calls for speculation .
and there &apos;s the second one .
also sustained .
um ... let &apos;s see .
just one second .
take it step by step .
what happened first ?
okay .
what happened on the day before you were fired ?
mr. clove ... made a physical advance toward me .
i resisted , and the next day , i was fired .
thank you .
no further questions .
ms. raker , hello .
i &apos;m sorry . this sexual advance sounds terrible .
my gosh , what happened ?
he reached for my shoulders , and i pushed him away .
and where was this , in a bedroom somewhere ?
no , it was the staff lounge .
in the lounge ? really ? alone ?
no .
so , did someone call the cops ?
no , they &apos;re used to it from mr. clove .
because isn &apos;t it true that what you describe
is mr. clove trying to massage your shoulders ?
yes .
and ...
this is something mr. clove does good @-@ naturedly to all professors ?
that doesn &apos;t make it right .
it &apos;s unwanted attention .
i resisted , and the next day , i was fired .
this is much ado about nothing .
i &apos;m a tactile person .
if someone refuses and say &quot; no , &quot; i never do it again .
i respect boundaries .
and you squeeze the shoulders of both men and women ?
as an encouragement .
it &apos;s not sexual .
and
when ms. raker asked you to stop , you stopped ?
yes , of course .
i &apos;m sorry i made her uncomfortable .
thank you . no further questions .
hit him hard .
you stopped , but then you fired her ?
no .
i fired her because she was receiving negative student evaluations .
that had nothing to do with her refusing a shoulder squeeze .
my god . i &apos;m not an idiot .
but you told ...
i mean ,
pamela says something differently , doesn &apos;t she ?
who &apos;s pamela ?
my client , mr. arbitrator .
oh , yup , she sure is .
go ahead .
mr. arbitrator , could you ask the opposing counsel
to refrain from her vocalizations ?
my ... ? what am i doing ?
you are making scoffing and chuckling sounds
to intimidate my co @-@ counsel .
really ? i would think that mrs. florrick &apos;s
interruptions would be much more likely to disrupt
her co @-@ counsel than any sound i &apos;m making .
okay , ladies , we don &apos;t want to have a catfight here .
you can go ahead and answer the question .
what was the question ?
let &apos;s start again .
why did you tell pamela , my client ,
that you were downsizing the department ,
when in fact , you hired someone to replace her the next day ?
i didn &apos;t want to hurt her feelings .
nobody likes to hear they &apos;re getting negative reviews .
and did you hire someone who was happy to get your backrubs ?
objection . argumentative .
oh , i don &apos;t know .
uh , yeah , sure .
yes , sustained .
let me try again .
when did you get these student evaluations ?
which student evaluations ?
the ones you used as a basis for firing my client ?
i don &apos;t know . in august .
you &apos;re right .
it was in august .
three days after you fired her .
these are not the evaluations i was referring to .
they were verbal from fellow teachers and students .
they said that ms. raker was disruptive ,
argumentative , not up to her job .
and what were these arguments about-- the arguments you referred to ?
i don &apos;t know .
politics , for one .
she &apos;s very vocal about her differences .
her differences , meaning she &apos;s a republican ?
objection . relevance .
the relevance is that
if our client was fired for her political views ,
there is no cap on the arbitration recovery .
how so ?
sexual harassment is included
in the automatic arbitration cap dispute resolution .
but there is no cap for civil rights violations ,
and to fire someone for their politics
is a civil rights violation .
anything ?
mr. arbitrator , we ask
for a recess to discuss with our witness .
take all the time you want .
good job .
now this will get interesting .
i may need your help .
i &apos;ll be right down .
hello .
are you busy ?
you have a small hairline crack right here .
i think there &apos;s a hole in your air duct insulation .
i can hear a small hiss .
i have perfect pitch .
did you know that ?
my parents wanted me to be a concert pianist .
i did not know that .
my parents wanted me to be a senator .
i could see that .
so what are we up to in here , eli ?
oh , i &apos;m meeting with a new client .
see ?
it appears i am no longer flavor of the month .
what do you plan to do about that ?
i plan to sit here and study the ceiling .
eli ,
do you notice all the lawyers out there rushing around ?
do you ever wonder why they &apos;re so busy ?
&apos;cause they got gumption ?
because they &apos;re not trying to go it alone .
you &apos;ve put too much pressure on yourself
to bring in your own client base , eli .
you &apos;ve pissed off will to the point
where he doesn &apos;t want to send you clients .
david lee is handling the divorce of a congresswoman .
who ?
i &apos;m not going to tell you .
talk to him .
i know you &apos;re used to going it alone , eli .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re in here alone .
make friends .
be nice to people .
don &apos;t try to do it all yourself .
she tells us to check in and then she &apos;s not even there .
it &apos;s fine , just leave a message .
she &apos;s probably in court .
ah , mrs. florrick .
mr. canning .
i &apos;ve missed you .
and i you .
so how are our children doing ?
playing nice .
so you didn &apos;t like martha ?
i liked her .
if we hadn &apos;t hired caitlin , it would have been her .
and caitlin was , what , just so irresistible ?
do you find that hard to believe ?
alicia , caitlin was hired because she &apos;s david lee &apos;s niece .
i know how things work , i know how the game is played .
martha was the better hire ,
but like everything else at your firm ,
it &apos;s who you know , not what you do .
oh , unlike your grand meritocracy ?
do i look like someone who judges books by covers ?
no , caitlin is the package , but martha is the real deal .
let &apos;s go in , see who &apos;s better .
just so you know , there &apos;s a job for you at my firm .
good to know .
i think my point was missed .
i didn &apos;t say i laid off ms. raker
because her politics were different than mine .
her politics were irrelevant to your decision ?
of course .
i run a tolerant workplace .
in fact , she made everything political-- intolerant .
she argued with everyone .
and that is not a civil rights issue ?
not in my opinion , no .
if a person is making it difficult
for other people to work , it is within my purview to let them go .
specifics help you here .
the more specific , the better .
that &apos;s all i did .
no further questions .
so , mr. clove , i &apos;m confused .
did you fire our client because of the first reason--
downsizing-- or the second reason--
the student evaluations that you didn &apos;t read--
or the third reason-- disrupting the workplace ?
maybe you do things for only one reason , miss .
i tend to do things for many .
so which reason was it ?
the evaluations i heard
from teachers and students and what i mentioned--
she was disruptive in the workplace .
because she spoke about politics ?
what kind of politics ?
the tea party line , anti @-@ choice , things like that .
she spoke about abortion ? she spoke against abortion ?
yes .
she was reacting to something she &apos;d seen on cnn
about roe v. wade and that it &apos;s a genocide . she just went off .
the other teachers disagreed with her ?
objection-- calls for speculation .
i &apos;m going to sustain that .
did the other teachers complain about her ?
yes , but not because they disagreed with her ,
but because she was disruptive .
so there were some professors who agreed with her
that abortion is genocide ?
i don &apos;t know , i didn &apos;t ask .
i make it a point not to ask .
my workplace is politically neutral .
i don &apos;t tolerate politics in the workplace .
so , uh , let &apos;s turn to her other political views .
you mentioned the tea party line , things like that .
oh , would you like me to slow down for you ?
well , that would be the sporting thing to do .
that &apos;s okay , you can tell mr. canning i &apos;m done .
andrew wiley .
oh , no , no , you don &apos;t want me .
duty calls , buddy .
&quot; assuming the exercise of any average
provided for in &apos; b &apos; above
does not conclude with an agreement
between the parties resolving the dispute ,
the parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration ,
and where the parties do not compile , binding arbitration ...
i understand you want to push this off as long as possible ,
but my client has pressing time issues
that makes that impossible .
i think my point was politically neutral .
i didn &apos;t say i prevented individual teacher activism .
but you fired pamela
because she disagreed with these political beliefs ?
no , i fired ms. raker because she was disruptive at work .
but if she supported these positions ,
she wouldn &apos;t be disruptive ?
i can &apos;t answer that-- that &apos;s a hypothetical .
none of us can answer that .
mr. arbitrator ,
this is an arbitration about facts , not imagined slights ,
and the facts are that it &apos;s within the provost &apos;s purview
to fire ms. raker for causing a disruption to the workplace .
and if the disruption was merely
because pamela raker was a republican ?
as long as he fired her
because of the disruption and not the politics ,
there &apos;s no civil rights infraction .
okay , thank you .
goodness gracious ... the handlers have taken over .
mr. arbitrator , we ask that this complaint be dismissed .
and we ask the arbitrator &apos; indulgence .
we have further civil rights arguments
but we won &apos;t be able to present them until tomorrow .
objection , mr. arbitrator .
at a certain point , this arbitration must conclude .
okay .
good idea , thank you very much .
well observed , well argued , well , well played ,
and with that , we &apos;ll reconvene tomorrow .
mr. arbitrator , please .
hold on .
i will not shortchange justice ,
mr. canning , that &apos;s not going to happen , not here .
it means we &apos;ll be here all week if we have to be .
so , adjournment .
very smart .
arbitrators get paid by the hour .
they love their recesses and tangents .
what &apos;s next , inalienable rights of life and liberty ?
good idea .
yeah , your only problem is damages .
all this effort and she &apos;s still only out , what , a paycheck or two ?
hey , it &apos;s caitlin .
yeah , do you have a minute ?
the problem we have is damages .
nice pass , your honor .
oh , little girl .
angela , give the ball back .
angela , give the ball . here .
thanks .
no problem .
you &apos;re will gardner , right ?
i am . do i ... ?
can just anybody join the game or is it ... ?
oh , no , sorry , just old friends .
lawyers , judges , weekend warriors , you know .
it &apos;s nice to meet you .
i &apos;m , i &apos;m not a lawyer ,
but i am a freelance investigator for wendy scott @-@ carr .
does that help ?
i &apos;ll be right back .
you guys have the wrong idea about this .
really , what &apos;s the right idea ?
the right idea is , friends are playing ball .
this is not about work . it &apos;s about what happens after work .
oh , yeah , that makes sense-- lawyers , judges , friends .
there &apos;s nothing criminal in socializing .
you &apos;re right .
see , the thing is , i &apos;ve been looking
into the lockhart / gardner cases for the past three years .
it &apos;s kind of amazing , really .
why is that ?
how many you win .
we &apos;re good .
yeah , yeah , apparently .
you &apos;ve got , like , an 80 % win rate--
angela , you &apos;re going to get really dizzy--
often in front of some very , very friendly judges .
you have a problem with any individual case , show me ,
and i &apos;ll show you how we won .
deal .
sabrina , no more apple juice .
i have to go , but i will--
i &apos;ll , i &apos;ll bring you some odd wins and we &apos;ll discuss .
sure , anything for you guys in the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
come on , honey , i told you .
yeah ?
eli , to what do i owe this honor ?
just making the rounds .
rounds , what rounds ?
seeing how people work , what they do ,
being ... friendly .
ah , well , sit down .
would you like some scotch ?
no .
thank you , though .
so ...
so ...
you want me to share the wealth .
the ... ?
my clients
who would benefit you ,
who i could introduce to you
if i were so inclined .
and how do i so incline you ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m a mystery .
okay , i &apos;ll have some scotch .
we go for the general concept of damage to reputation .
pamela couldn &apos;t get another job .
do you need something ?
uh , it &apos;s not the original e @-@ mail ,
but it &apos;s been quoted there and there .
oh , this is fantastic , kalinda , thanks .
alicia , it &apos;s damages .
i didn &apos;t know you were on this .
oh , i asked her to .
i called her yesterday .
if you need anything else , just give me a call .
thanks , kalinda .
&quot; she &apos;s nice .
i just have a real problem with homophobes . &quot;
did you write that , sir ?
i wrote that as a private e @-@ mail to one other person .
yes , and that one other person
was another provost at another school .
he asked my opinion of ms. raker .
your defamatory comment was discovered
on a private web site for college administrators ,
and that is why our client had difficulty getting a new job .
excuse me ,
i &apos;d love to share caitlin &apos;s sense of outrage here ,
but mr. clove &apos;s comments were written in a private e @-@ mail
and they were not intended for wide distribution .
yes , but it doesn &apos;t matter what was intended .
he wrote an e @-@ mail
that was widely distributed by the recipient .
legally he is as responsible as if he distributed it himself .
any questions , mr. canning ?
let me handle this .
mr. clove ,
what did ms. raker say to you
to elicit your offhand comment that she was a homophobe ?
she said that gay people could be cured ,
and when i asked her why would they want to be ,
she said , because what they did was disgusting .
that &apos;s not an exact quote ,
but i think it &apos;s a pretty good paraphrase .
mr. arbitrator ,
not only is this not defamatory .
ms. raker &apos;s comments are hate speech , pure and simple .
not only was mr. clove within his rights
to warn others of this hate speech ,
he was right to fire her .
i think some very good points are being made
and ...
i think the best thing to do would be to adjourn .
the other professors were making fun of rick santorum
for saying homosexual acts were like bestiality .
i was defending him , that &apos;s all .
i said his logic made sense to me .
you &apos;re a christian , right ?
i am-- crc-- christian reformed .
okay , we need to get you back on the stand tomorrow .
i got you the cheese account .
you lost us the cheese account .
no . we all did that .
the point is , i made the effort ,
i didn &apos;t have to .
see ? that &apos;s your problem .
you think of it as a favor .
this is what we do-- we share .
i &apos;m sharing . i &apos;m here , sharing .
you came in here throwing your weight around ,
not coming to staff meetings .
you want me to come to staff meetings .
i don &apos;t want anything .
i &apos;m explaining to you why you &apos;re not getting anything in return .
okay , i will ... be more involved .
there . next .
why is peter investigating me ?
i didn &apos;t know he was .
he is .
you &apos;re still his political strategist , right ?
is this for politics or something else ?
i have no idea .
have you asked alicia ?
i mean , because she works here , she might know .
i haven &apos;t told her .
i didn &apos;t want to make it her business .
but it is her business .
isn &apos;t it ?
what &apos;s he investigating ?
corruption .
there &apos;s nothing there .
but if he &apos;s investigating me , it hurts the firm .
it hurts you .
that &apos;s what sharing &apos;s all about :
being part of the firm , knowing that if i &apos;m hurt ...
you &apos;re hurt .
i will see what i can find out .
good .
thanks .
&quot; if anyone lie with a man as with a woman ,
both have committed an abomination
let them be put to death . &quot;
so , what &apos;s that ?
leviticus . chapter 20 .
what &apos;s this for , a case ?
yeah , wrongful termination .
do you believe all this , grace ?
i don &apos;t know .
like , some of the bible i get , and some i don &apos;t .
well , what about your uncle owen ?
he &apos;s gay .
i know . that &apos;s the part i don &apos;t get .
i guess i thought ...
with your dancing and everything you &apos;d moved on .
no . i can do both .
i &apos;m sorry i missed your call yesterday .
it &apos;s okay .
zach &apos;s a pretty good driver .
you don &apos;t have to worry .
i &apos;m not .
or i am , but ... not about that .
what , then ?
i don &apos;t know . something .
i just have to shake it off .
is it about will ?
zach said he met him in the office .
no , it &apos;s not about will .
i &apos;m ...
grace , i &apos;m sorry it &apos;s been such a hard year .
are you good ?
yeah . i just want to make sure that you are .
i am . i am .
there &apos;s just too many distractions right now , that &apos;s all .
get rid of them .
okay , i will .
so , you know him ?
do i know the investigator , wiley ?
yeah , i &apos;ve met him .
you think he &apos;s good ?
are you really asking me for references on a detective
investigating my firm ?
yes . is that inappropriate ?
wiley thinks you guys buy your wins .
really ?
well , what else do you need ?
you haven &apos;t slept with cary , have you ?
you talk a lot about sex .
well , i find it interesting , don &apos;t you ?
cary talks about you during sex .
really ?
yeah .
want to know what he says ?
i think you want me to know what he says .
i could go either way .
yeah , you could .
you flirt with everyone .
it a personal failing ; we seem to share that .
no , we don &apos;t .
when i start , i follow through .
&quot; if anyone lie with a man as with a woman ,
both have committed an abomination ... &quot;
leviticus 20 : 13 .
do you believe that ?
i do .
but even if you didn &apos;t want to believe it ,
you would have to believe it .
i &apos;m a member of the christian reformed church of north america .
we believe the bible is the authoritative word of god .
and so the speech that mr. clove referred to
as homophobic was not hate @-@ speech ,
it was religiously based speech ?
in fact , i &apos;m appalled
that mr. clove called me homophobic behind my back .
if he asked , i would explain my biblical justification .
thank you , pamela .
unfortunately , mrs. florrick didn &apos;t read far enough .
what &apos;s the next line in leviticus ?
and those men who lie with men as they lie with with women ,
the instruction is to kill them .
isn &apos;t it ?
that was an instruction promulgated by moses for the levites .
ah , so it doesn &apos;t apply today ?
because otherwise , you should be out killing gay people , right ?
to say that jesus &apos; love tempered the need for punishment
doesn &apos;t change what is considered right and wrong .
is mr. canning really trying to determine what is religiously based speech
and what is not ?
the point is , mr. clove defamed our client as homophobic ,
when clearly he knew it was religiously based speech .
yes . uh , mr. canning , i think that &apos;s right .
i don &apos;t really think i &apos;m here to sever any gordian knots .
the question is not : what is religious ?
the question is : did mr. clove know that pamela was religious ?
and with that question ,
i think we should take ... a short break .
the arbitrator sounds sympathetic towards us , doesn &apos;t he ?
all right .
what ?
let &apos;s make a deal .
she can &apos;t have her job back .
then she &apos;ll need money--
because your client has made it difficult
for her to get a job anywhere else .
you &apos;re coming to my firm , alicia .
i am ?
when ?
eventually .
will gardner and diane lockhart don &apos;t have children , and i do .
and that matters why ?
well , they like their employees to work long hours because ...
their work is their home .
my home is my home .
i love my home . i like my kids .
you want to spend more time with your kids ,
you should be at my firm .
you can work at home ; you can telecommute .
i don &apos;t like your clientele , mr. canning .
that &apos;s right .
my mean ... corporate clients .
thank you .
the one percent .
like mr. remiddi . used to be worth $ 2 billion ,
until he gave half to african aids research .
or miss lani janklow .
started her own company . takes trips to bolivia
to develop micro @-@ financing in third world countries .
of course they &apos;re no donny pike .
we don &apos;t represent donny pike .
that &apos;s right , you represent colin sweeney .
your phone &apos;s blinking .
hello ? grace ?
hi . this is grace . leave a message .
what &apos;s wrong ?
first voice message .
come on , get in the car .
where are we going ?
you &apos;ll see .
everything all right ?
zach , hi . i , um ...
is grace with you ?

okay .
kalinda , you got a minute ?
no .
what &apos;s wrong ?
what ?
i told her to leave a note on the refrigerator .
can your driver take me to my apartment ?
sure .
i know your usual procedure is to wait 24 hours
before declaring a missing person .
that &apos;s not happening here .
this is my daughter .
and you &apos;re gonna have to start right now .
her friend is waiting at school .
i need you to get a sketch artist there right now .
i can &apos;t talk .
i don &apos;t know .
all right , all right ,
just pause for a second , take a deep breath .
you all right ?
yeah .
now what did grace and you talk about ?
you ever talk about any guys ?
no . uh , no one .
no one she wants to see , no one she even mentioned once ?
no , she &apos;s not interested in any of that .
all right , and did she talk to anyone online ?
she &apos;s not at my place .
i thought she might be here .
hold on . hold on .
it &apos;s just been a few hours .
it &apos;s probably nothing .
i baptize you in the name of the father ...
... the son ...
is she angry ?
i don &apos;t know .
i was only gone an hour .
and i didn &apos;t call her 12 times .
the phone was in my back pocket .
i butt @-@ called her .
aren &apos;t you coming ?
no .
but my mom will want to thank you .
i &apos;m fine
should i tell her that you found me ?
no
okay , well , thanks for the ride .
mom .
grace .
i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t know .
i &apos;m so sorry .
dad .
commitment
what do you think of commitment
i think it &apos;s something people do .
i saw alicia with her daughter
i thought &quot; maybe i can do that &quot;
you don &apos;t think i can ?
no , i think you can do what you want .
what do you want ?
something more than work .
kids ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve spent my whole life getting ahead .
sometimes i can &apos;t figure out why .
do you know what alicia wants ?
no .
but i &apos;ll ask .
if you don &apos;t know something , ask , right ?
mr. arbitrator ,
before we begin , i need to present an exhibit .
certainly .
what do you have for me , mr. canning ?
it &apos;s an e @-@ mail
from pamela raker to her sister just before she was let go .
it just came into my possession .
if i may ,
uh , &quot; sis , i know i &apos;m not supposed to hide my light under a bushel ,
but at this job i have to .
my views get me into enough shouting matches as it is .
if they knew i was a testifying christian ,
i &apos;d never get ahead .
objection , mr. arbitrator .
where did mr. canning obtain this e @-@ mail ?
does it matter ?
if ms. raker actively hid her beliefs ,
then mr. clove had no way
of knowing she was , in fact , religious .
and you &apos;re correct--
that is really what &apos;s at stake here .
anything ?
seriously ?
yes , mrs. florrick ?
i was waititg for my daughter to come home ,
and you took that moment to steal into my bag ?
no .
you took advantage of my situation .
i did not .
i &apos;m a parent , as are you ,
and i would never do anything like that .
oh , come on , mr. canning .
then how did you get a copy of that e @-@ mail ?
i waited till your daughter was safe .
then i looked in your bag .
are you serious ?
yes . if your daughter hadn &apos;t returned home ,
i wouldn &apos;t have looked .
i &apos;m not a monster .
and i still want you to come work for our firm .
alicia , you had a bad day today .
you got beat .
i know you think we &apos;re cutthroat ,
and i guess ...
we are .
but you &apos;ll always be home in time to see your kids .
and that &apos;s something to think about .
so don &apos;t answer me now ; just think about it , but ...
kids need their parents .
hi , will .
it seems like i haven &apos;t seen you in a while .
i know .
i heard everything &apos;s good with your daughter .
yes , thank you .
will ...
yes ?
i can &apos;t . it &apos;s too much .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m gonna miss you .
you did the right thing .
she &apos;ll get over it .
yep .
