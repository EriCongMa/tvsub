no , seriously ,
i think i &apos;ve finally figured out my problem with women .
the capybara is the largest member of the rodent family .
what does that have to do with me and women ?
nothing . it was a desperate attempt
to introduce an alternate topic of conversation .
my problem is , i don &apos;t project confidence .
so i decided the next time i meet a woman i think is attractive ,
rather than holding back and being cautious ,
i &apos;m going to assume the mantle of self @-@ assurance .
oh , yeah ? what &apos;s that look like ?
hi .
i &apos;m leonard .
and you are beautiful .
you pop , sparkle and buzz electric .
i &apos;m going to pick you up at 8 : 00,
show you a night you will never forget .
where are we going ?
good news .
i made it onto the team for the new defense department
laser @-@ equipped surveillance satellite .
excuse me .
if we &apos;re changing topics , i believe i have first dibs
with capybara , a rodent the size of a baby hippo .
congratulations , howard .
thanks .
listen , i have to get a security clearance ,
so you guys might be hearing from the fbi .
i don &apos;t want to speak to the fbi .
why not ?
i &apos;m brown and i talk funny .
they &apos;re just doing a background check on me .
it doesn &apos;t matter , they &apos;ll find a reason
to give me a one @-@ way ticket back to gandhi @-@ ville .
by the way , when i say that , it &apos;s not offensive .
don &apos;t be ridiculous , raj .
you &apos;re here legally .
nobody cares . do you know how long it &apos;s been
since i got through airport security
without being given a colonoscopy ?
you know , i try very hard
to make our lunch hours educational and informative ,
but your insistence on talking about your own lives
stymies me at every turn .
fine , sheldon , tell us about your giant rodents .
no , you squandered your time with me ,
and the moment has now passed .
feast on your disappointment ,
much as the capybara feasts on its own waste .
oh , bella , don &apos;t you see ?
edward &apos;s only pushing you away because he loves you .
coming .
dr. koothrappali ?
i &apos;m special agent page , fbi .
may i come in ?
i &apos;d like to talk to you about howard wolowitz .
oh , thank you .
all right . well , how long have you known mr. wolowitz ?
rum cake ?
no , thanks .
now , about mr. wolowitz ...
seven years .
i see .
i &apos;m in this country legally , you know .
i &apos;m sure you are .
now , to your knowledge ,
has mr. wolowitz ever committed a crime ?
of course not .
i &apos;m here on an h @-@ 1b visa ,
which means i can &apos;t be associated in any way
with crime or criminal activity and i &apos;m not .
good .
to your knowledge , does mr. wolowitz
have any foreign contacts ?
no , just me .
oh , there it is .
here comes a cavity search .
excuse me ?
please don &apos;t send me back to india , it &apos;s so crowded !
it &apos;s like the whole country is one endless comic @-@ con ,
except everybody &apos;s wearing the same costume :
indian guy .
dr. koothrappali , i &apos;m not ...
i love this country !
the @-@ the baseball , the freedom ,
the rampant morbid obesity !
from california to the new york island !
i &apos;m a real yankee doodle boy !
dr. koothrappali , please .
my country &apos; tis of thee ... ?
... liberty
it &apos;s really great .
so , when howard said the fbi would be contacting me ,
i was expecting mulder .
glad to see i got scully .
who ?
mulder and scully .
x @-@ files .
&quot; the truth is out there . &quot; never mind .
uh , so , what would you like to know ?
you work with mr. wolowitz here at the university , correct ?
yes . of course , we &apos;re in different departments .
he &apos;s an engineer and i &apos;m an experimental physicist .
you know , one of those guys
who examines the building blocks of creation
and says , &quot; hello , maker of the universe .
&quot; i see what you did there .
good one . &quot;
right .
now , how would you characterize
your relationship with mr. wolowitz ?
good .
it &apos;s a good relationship .
of course , most of my relationships are good .
probably because i exude confidence .
people are drawn to that , you know ?
confidence , not exuding .
do you know of any groups mr. wolowitz is a member of ?
you are beautiful , you know that ?
you pop , sparkle and buzz electric .
i &apos;m going to pick you up at 8 : 00,
show you a night you will never forget .
sounds great .
really ?
can my six @-@ foot @-@ two
navy seal husband come with us ?
is that ... ?
oh , my , i didn &apos;t see the ring with my glasses off , so ...
look at that , i &apos;m starting to exude .
want to get that ?
not particularly .
could you get that ?
i suppose i could if i were asked .
would you please get that ?
of course .
why do you have to make things so complicated ?
dr. cooper ?
yes .
i &apos;m special agent page , fbi .
you say you &apos;re
special agent page , fbi .
here &apos;s my i.d.
and here is my justice league membership card .
but that doesn &apos;t prove i know batman .
i just want to ask you a few questions
about howard wolowitz .
oh . all right .
i doubt anyone would risk
the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer
just to ask questions about a minor league engineer
with an unresolved oedipal complex .
thank you .
for the record , i truly support the fbi
in the mission which is expressed
through their motto ... ?
fidelity , bravery , and integrity .
correct . now to business .
18 years ago , i sent the fbi crime lab samples
from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire
on my front porch ...
... for fingerprinting and dna analysis .
why haven &apos;t i heard back yet ?
well , the fbi crime lab does have a lot on its plate .
that &apos;s of little comfort to a nation
attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes .
would you mind if we talked about mr. wolowitz now ?
a little , but go on .
thank you .
would you characterize him as responsible ?
i &apos;m going to answer that with a visual aid .
this is my nine @-@ disc complete
lord of the rings trilogy blu @-@ ray set .
mr. wolowitz borrowed it ,
damaged plastic retention hub number three ...
... and then returned it to me , hoping i wouldn &apos;t notice .
would you characterize that as responsible ?
that &apos;s really not the sort of thing we &apos;re interested in .
you heard me say blu @-@ ray , right ?
i did .
very well .
would you be interested
in knowing that mr. wolowitz once snuck onto
my world of warcraft account and changed the name
of a certain level @-@ 80 warlock from sheldor to smeldor ?
i &apos;m afraid not .
is there anything else ?
&quot; is there anything else &quot; ?
where would you like to start ?
he refuses to pay fines
when he &apos;s overdue with books i lend him .
he crashed the mars rover
while attempting to impress a woman .
he recommended that i go see
the third matrix movie because it was , and i quote ,
&quot; just as good as the first one . &quot;
if that &apos;s not irresponsible , i don &apos;t know what is .
the mars rover ?
did i say mars rover ?
you did .
that was actually a poorly chosen example ,
as it had nothing to do with me .
yes , well , let &apos;s talk about it anyway .
i don &apos;t want to .
not that my disinclination
to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of
howard wolowitz &apos;s culpability in the destruction
of government property worth millions of dollars .
thank you , dr. cooper .
i think i have all i need .
oh , good .
i was afraid you were going to fixate
on that mars rover incident .
hey , buddies .
guess who didn &apos;t get security clearance
to work on the giant space laser ?
what happened ?
apparently , the background interviews didn &apos;t go well .
you guys wouldn &apos;t know anything about that , would you ?
well , actually , i may have gotten
a little tipsy when i talked to her .
and i may have hit on her a little bit .
i may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes .
i see .
well , it &apos;s good to know , when i need you guys ,
i can always count on you to step up and ruin everything .
i feel awful .
ah , me , too .
to tell you the truth ,
i thought if anyone was going to
screw things up for howard , it &apos;d be sheldon .
well , your expectations have been subverted .
aha .
what are you doing up ?
sleep eludes me , leonard .
really ?
maybe sleep has met you before .
mockery ?
that &apos;s all you have to offer ?
i &apos;m sorry . why can &apos;t you sleep ?
who knows ?
i haven &apos;t watched any scary movies recently .
i &apos;m no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass
of the quantum vacuum has little effect
on the expansion of the universe .
and it &apos;s been weeks since i took that accidental sip of red bull .
did something happen today that &apos;s bothering you ?
well , i did mention
the mars rover incident to that fbi agent
and probably cost howard his security clearance .
what ?
but why should that keep me up ?
because you feel guilty ?
interesting .
so you &apos;re saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience .
actually , you don &apos;t have insomnia .
you &apos;re sleeping now .
excuse me ?
you &apos;re having a guilt @-@ ridden dream .
do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis ?
how about that gorn sitting on the couch ?
that seems fairly conclusive .
no , gorn , no .
that &apos;s where i sit .
thank you for agreeing to see me , agent page .
thank you for filing a complaint with my superior , dr. cooper .
i understand you want to recant
your statement about howard wolowitz .
yes .
was your statement untrue ?
no .
then i &apos;m afraid you can &apos;t withdraw it .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t recall you saying &quot; no backsies . &quot;
is there anything else ?
yes . i &apos;d like to offer a laudatory statement
about howard &apos;s many excellent qualities that i believe
will tip the scales back in his favor .
&quot; howard joel wolowitz .
&quot; h is for honesty , of which he has much .
&quot; o &apos;s for outstanding ,
&quot; which he is such .
&quot; w &apos;s for witty , he &apos;s quick with a joke .
a &apos;s for artistic , his ability ... &quot;
i &apos;m sorry .
dr. cooper , this matter is already closed .
but i still have &quot; rd joel wolowitz &quot; left to go .
it &apos;s closed .
i don &apos;t understand why you people
are picking on my friend , howard ,
when there are much more serious security threats to pursue .
for instance , when i first met leonard ,
he was on the verge of giving away
rocket secrets to a north korean spy ,
and not one agent ever investigated that .
this is leonard hofstadter ?
no , it &apos;s a different leonard .
he &apos;s ...
chinese , red hair , six fingers . good @-@ bye .
raj .
have you seen howard ?
i think he &apos;s eating lunch .
uh , sheldon , i want you to meet neil degrasse tyson
from the hayden planetarium in new york .
i &apos;m quite familiar with dr. tyson .
he &apos;s responsible for the demotion of pluto
from planetary status .
i liked pluto .
ergo i do not like you .
but i actually didn &apos;t demote pluto .
that was a vote of the international astronomical union .
if &quot; ifs &quot; and &quot; buts &quot; were candy and nuts ,
we &apos;d all have a merry christmas .
think about that , dr. tyson .
is that the guy you were telling me about ?
oh , yeah .
howard .
the person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me .
you ?
yes , but before you get upset , i want you to know
i went to the fbi and retracted my statement .
and they were okay with that ?
no . if anything , i made it worse .
in any case , i have been riddled with guilt ,
which is causing gorn @-@ infested rem sleep .
so , i &apos;m here now to say i &apos;m sorry .
are you kidding me ?
you &apos;ve set my career back at least two years ,
and you think you can make it right with &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; ?
yes .
i followed the social protocol .
i attempted to right the wrong , and when i failed to do so ,
i delivered a heartfelt apology .
now you say ,
&quot; apology accepted , &quot;
and i will offer you a one @-@ time @-@ only high five .
your apology is not accepted .
you &apos;re tricking me .
it really is , isn &apos;t it ?
leave me alone , sheldon .
dr. cooper , i just wanted you to know
i &apos;m sorry for the role i played in the pluto matter .
oh , shut up .
sheldon ?
hello .
what are you doing here ?
i have troubles , penny .
i &apos;ve come to pour them out
to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep .
you know , they have a really nice bar over at the olive garden .
i don &apos;t like the olive garden .
they treat me like family .
okay , sheldon . what can i get you ?
alcohol .
could you be a little more specific ?
ethyl alcohol .
40 milliliters .
i &apos;m sorry , honey . i don &apos;t know milliliters .
ah . blame president james &quot; jimmy &quot; carter .
he started america on a path to the metric system
but then just gave up .
he wonders why he was a one @-@ term president .
would you say that &apos;s about 40 milliliters ?
more or less .
great .
now , where were we ?
i believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail .
fortunately , thanks to computer @-@ savvy alcoholics ,
there &apos;s an app for that .
let &apos;s see .
harvey wallbanger . eh .
sex on the beach . i hardly think so .
rob roy , silk slipper , mad hatter .
i &apos;ll have a rosewater ricky .
a what ?
you &apos;ll need pitted , brandied cherries , gin ,
rosewater , angostura bitters and overproofed rum .
now , first , dust the cherries with sugar ,
then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters .
then ignite the rum , caramel ...
here you go -- one rosewater ricky .
that &apos;s not how it looks in the picture .
oh , yeah , you know , every bartender makes it differently .
why don &apos;t you give it a try .
all right .
to the metric system .
i can &apos;t taste the cherries .
all right . sheldon , what &apos;s on your mind ?
i wronged howard , and he won &apos;t accept my apology .
oh , right , that .
yes , leonard told me . sorry , honey .
penny , you face failure on a daily basis .
how do you cope ?
i drink .
to drinking .
nope .
if only there were some way to force howard to accept my apology
so i could escape this miasma of guilt .
you know , sometimes stuff just happens ,
and there &apos;s nothing you can do about it .
lisa peterson hasn &apos;t talked to me since the 11th grade ,
because no matter how much you apologize ,
you can &apos;t go back and un @-@ dry @-@ hump someone &apos;s boyfriend .
i see .
you &apos;re saying i &apos;m facing starfleet academy &apos;s
unwinnable command scenario : the kobayashi maru .
exactly .
sometimes you can &apos;t win .
captain kirk won .
kirk cheated .
impressive that you know that .
it &apos;s hard to believe i &apos;m actually having this conversation with you .
right there with you .
kirk beat the kobayashi maru by reprogramming the simulator .
that &apos;s it .
what ?
i &apos;ll reprogram howard .
what ... ?
sheldon , you can &apos;t reprogram people .
no , you can &apos;t reprogram people .
to james tiberius kirk .
hello , all .
howard , you &apos;re feeling better about me today , aren &apos;t you ?
not really .
yes , you are .
i &apos;m using neurolinguistic programming
to modify your thought patterns .
go away , sheldon .
there &apos;s a $ 9.95 e @-@ book down the drain .
what &apos;s in the bag ?
it &apos;s for howard .
oh . sheldon , you can &apos;t fix this with gifts .
nevertheless , i &apos;ve hurt you ,
and whether you forgive me or not , i want you to have this .
you &apos;re giving me a couch cushion ?
no .
the cushion is merely symbolic .
i &apos;m giving you my spot on the couch .
but you love that spot .
no . i love my mother .
my feelings for my spot are much greater .
it is the singular location in space
around which revolves my entire universe .
and now it &apos;s yours .
oh , my god , dude . now you have to forgive him .
all right .
apology accepted .
high five .
not too hard .
thank you .
i haven &apos;t cried like this since toy story 3 .
i got to tell you ,
sheldon , i understand why you chose this spot .
i mean , the temperature is good , but there &apos;s no draft .
i can see the television , but i can still talk to ...
i changed my mind . get out of my spot .
how long ?
