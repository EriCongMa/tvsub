jeez , i hope you &apos;re training for something ,
or do you just do sprints for fun ?
i &apos;m trying to do this triathlon in february .
oh , yeah . the fbi one .
what &apos;s her name ?
beth .
i like it .
ok , rossi , out with it .
is hotch dating ?
i don &apos;t know .
so , i was reading that you
shouldn &apos;t train the week before the race .
so ... this might be it .
what are we gonna do about that ?
well , i think we should do something .
you know , race day &apos;s almost here .
you &apos;ll need a new excuse to see her .
it &apos;s been handled .
attaboy .
i want you so bad .
what are you waiting for ?
still not feeling it ?
just keep trying . just keep trying . come on .
this isn &apos;t working .
maybe you &apos;re just not in the mood .
just give me 5 more minutes .
come on . really ?
look , i &apos;ve done it before .
i can do it . it works .
relax . i &apos;m not saying you &apos;re broken .
it happens . don &apos;t worry about it .
i already paid for the night .
yeah , i know , but , honestly ,
what &apos;s gonna happen now
that hasn &apos;t happened in the last couple of hours ?
come on . i just want to try one more thing .
thanks .
one chai tea .
now , correct me if i &apos;m wrong ,
but chai means tea .
so i just ordered you a--
a tea tea .
so , wait a minute . there &apos;s a chance you &apos;re gonna
be out on a case this weekend ?
probably a good chance .
what if you don &apos;t make it back in time ?
i &apos;ll just have to do another race .
but you trained for this one .
i know . i &apos;ll just have to do the next one .
maybe i &apos;ll do yours .
but you trained so hard .
i know . all for nothing .
yeah , too bad nothing good came of it .
um , well , assuming you do make it back ,
i &apos;d really like to be there , you know .
to see me collapse at the finish line .
i want that moment . i do .
i know jack &apos;s gonna be there , so ...
that &apos;s fine .
i &apos;d love for you to meet him .
great .
oh , you &apos;re not playing around .
mm . will &apos;s away all week ,
so i am pulling double duty with henry .
please tell me we are still on for saturday night ,
because i have had it circled
on my calendar for the last 23.1 / 2 days ,
which apparently , from the look of you , you did not .
garcia paid good money for those salsa lessons .
i &apos;ll get a sitter .
let &apos;s get started .
ok . atlanta field office has a serial on their hands .
two prostitutes stabbed and staged in the last two weeks .
atlanta &apos;s crime rate
has skyrocketed over the past few years .
especially the proliferation of solicited sex
and drug use in the downtown district .
maybe this guy thinks he &apos;s cleaning up the city .
it &apos;s rare for an unsub
who targets prostitutes to pose the bodies .
means of disposal usually
reflects how the person feels towards them .
it looks like he didn &apos;t think poorly of his victims .
even kept them dressed .
he could be filled with remorse .
the arms are folded , the bodies are laid to rest
in a quiet park outside the city . maybe he knew them .
it could be personal .
there &apos;s a lot of rage in these kills .
multiple stab wounds .
what about sexual violations ?
no . the m.e. &apos; s report says
there &apos;s no evidence of sexual activity before death .
so what &apos;s he doing with them ?
that &apos;s what we need to find out .
eckhart tolle said ,
&quot; where there is anger , there is always pain underneath . &quot;
both of the victims had $ 250 on them
when they were found .
why wouldn &apos;t the unsub take that ?
it &apos;s a lot to pass up . money must not be on his mind .
dumping the bodies certainly is .
he chose two different parks outside of atlanta .
the parks are 15 miles apart and 40 minutes from the city .
it speaks to his comfort zone .
or he didn &apos;t want to return to the same location
and risk getting recognized .
hey , guys , i hate to be the messenger of sad things ,
but yet another body has been discovered
by some joggers at yet another park .
her name &apos;s rebecca moore , and get this--
a missing persons report was filed on her .
well , how long was she missing ?
36 hours .
who filed it ?
her friend allyson parker .
prentiss , you and jj find out from allyson
if she has any insight on why rebecca was targeted .
morgan and reid , go to the disposal site ,
and dave and i will set up at the field office .
where have you been ?
out .
did you pick up the milk ?
no .
he likes milk with his pancakes .
sorry .
sorry . it &apos;s not gonna make it magically appear , now , is it ?
i made your favorites .
and i know you like a little oil in the pan
so the edges are crispy .
i considered making you scrambled eggs ,
but with that whole recall and everything ,
i figured pancakes are a safer bet .
how are they ?
you need to eat .
erika will be here any minute .
oh , i &apos;d like to have her for dinner .
how &apos;s tomorrow ?
sweetheart . sweetheart !
you haven &apos;t taken your vitamins .
those aren &apos;t vitamins .
donald .
hi . i &apos;m agent brooks .
thanks for getting here so fast .
this guy &apos;s not taking a break .
now 3 victims in two weeks ?
i thought there was supposed to be a cooling @-@ off period .
his recovery time is decreasing .
what &apos;s that about ?
it &apos;s hard to say .
well , i hope we catch him before there &apos;s another .
is your m.e. close ?
i can get you a ride .
we &apos;re picking up rebecca moore &apos;s body now .
why didn &apos;t you say anything at breakfast ?
he won &apos;t listen to me .
so i have to be the bad guy
while you just watch , or are you gonna sit there
like a lump on a log with that stupid look on your face ?
linda , i don &apos;t want to do this right now .
oh , you think i do ? when i am trying
to give jeffrey his pills , i need you to back me up .
is that understood ?
look at me .
we both know what happens
when he goes off his medication .
so he parks in the road and
then carries the body , what ?
fifty two point six yards .
so he &apos;s gonna be in great shape .
you know , more often than not , prostitute are
murdered and dumped in the same area that they work .
so then why take the time to
drive extra 40 miles outside the city ?
maybe he &apos;s already up here . he picks them up downtown ,
takes them to a secondary location ,
kills them , and gets rid of the body as fast as possible .
which means he lives nearby , in the suburbs .
with 76,728 other people .
your mum &apos;s so sweet .
she invited me to dinner tomorrow .
wanted to know if i was a vegetarian .
that &apos;s great .
now just give me one more set .
how about i give you two more ?
oh , really ?
well , you want me to stop ?
no , no , no . keep going .
now , this is one that i want you to keep up
for when your friends come over .
just remember that the bigger the challenge ,
the better the resistance .
nobody really comes by anymore .
really ?
yeah , i mean , they did at first ,
but once they went away to school , nobody looked back .
you know , sometimes friends ,
they don &apos;t know how to handle it .
they &apos;re afraid that they &apos;re gonna say the wrong thing .
yeah .
don &apos;t worry , though . i &apos;m gonna keep you warmed up
for when they come around again .
all right , stop this . i want you to take a break .
now , let &apos;s change things up .
let &apos;s isolate your chest and then 5 more pounds .
this will increase your upper body strength ,
which is gonna make it easier for you
when you &apos;re getting in and out of your chair .
you &apos;re gonna need a real challenge now
that you &apos;re getting stronger .
what do you mean ?
come on , you haven &apos;t noticed ?
maybe , a little .
are you kidding ? these past couple weeks
you &apos;ve been like superman .
spill it--what &apos;s your secret ?
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t know .
no ? ok , fine . you don &apos;t have to tell me .
just keep it up . whatever it is , you &apos;re doing great .
ok , get back in there .
we &apos;re very sorry for your loss .
how long were you and rebecca friends ?
3 years .
you two had each other &apos;s backs .
it &apos;s why you filed the report ?
it was almost two days .
i thought she was at the police station .
getting locked up is better than
disappearing with one of them .
so what made you think something was wrong ?
she always came back .
bad as it was , this place was home , you know ?
did she have any regular customers ?
we all do .
rebecca had over $ 250 on her .
she did ?
what would that kind of money get a customer ?
a lot .
like , all night or ...
nowadays , yeah .
what is it ?
we need to find another girl .
we just did .
so do it again .
i can &apos;t go back there .
why not ?
it &apos;s too soon .
find another way .
is he really getting better ?
i just heard erika say that she &apos;s noticed
a big improvement in the last couple of weeks .
don &apos;t you want him to be happy ?
i &apos;ll take care of it .
good .
any sexual assault ?
third victim , still no signs of inflammation
or forcible penetration .
his inability to perform
sexually could be what triggers his rage .
well , there &apos;s plenty of that .
multiple stab wounds to the lungs .
she drowned in her own blood .
it takes a lot of force to inflict these types of wounds .
oh , he &apos;s strong , no doubt .
the knife cut right through bone in some instances .
and what &apos;s this on her inner thigh ?
that &apos;s a tramline bruise .
it &apos;s cause by something with a longitudinal
cylindrical surface .
like a rod ?
yes . and i found the same type of bruising on the others .
maybe some kind of restraint ?
it &apos;s possible .
we need to take you back to the last time you saw rebecca .
where were you standing ?
about here .
facing which way ?
street .
a truck pulled up .
he was one of my regulars .
i was talking to him through the window
when rebecca pulled up in a silver beemer .
did you recognize the car ?
no . it must have been a new customer .
what did she do after that ?
she looked back at me and started walking down the walk .
that &apos;s the last time i saw her .
wait a second .
there was an older gray van .
i &apos;ve seen it around here before .
it was parked there a long time .
a van ? where ?
it parks right there .
could you make out a license plate ?
no , it was dark .
how long was it there ?
a few hours , probably .
why ?
it &apos;s a loading zone . permit parking only .
go long , bobby ! hut !
excuse me .
hi . i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m at the right address .
mr. collins ?
yes . hi .
i &apos;m sorry , can i help you ?
my name is julie . i &apos;m here to see jeffrey .
oh . yes .
please , come in .
were you going to use your insurance ?
i &apos;d like to pay out of pocket .
most of my clients haven &apos;t filed , either .
it &apos;s still considered progressive treatment , i guess .
that &apos;s a lovely necklace .
oh , thank you .
jeffrey &apos;s room is down at the end of the hall .
great . thanks .
reid , anything ?
now that we have 3 victims , there &apos;s a pattern .
it looks like his area of control is near ridgecrest .
that &apos;s a bedroom community . mostly white collar .
it give him easy access
to his hunting grounds and disposal sites .
vehicle blends into both places .
allyson remembered seeing a van parked on the street
the night that rebecca disappeared .
and she &apos;d seen it before . but get this--
it was parked in a loading zone for hours .
well , let me check any recent tickets .
our analyst already did that . nothing .
it &apos;s not a residential area , so a vendor maybe .
garcia &apos;s pulling permits now .
he &apos;s done this 3 times before .
each victim is left with 250 .
that &apos;s a $ 750 investment he didn &apos;t have to make .
he has every chance to take that money back ,
but he buries it with them instead .
it could be an obsession or a manifestation of his guilt .
everything that happened postmortem--
keeping them dressed , crossing their arms ,
laying them to rest--
it &apos;s all very nurturing .
but the kills are the exact opposite ,
incredibly violent and angry .
multiple personalities ?
or multiple unsubs .
the violent one asserts his dominance
and the submissive one is left to clean up the mess .
help me .
help me .
help me .
help me . help me .
her name was julie harmon ,
lived in a loft downtown ,
250 cash in her bag ,
wrapped in plastic .
that &apos;s new .
it &apos;s like she &apos;s prepped for a burial .
this woman doesn &apos;t fit victimology . look at her nails .
the way she &apos;s dressed .
her shoes haven &apos;t hit the pavement .
maybe she &apos;s a high @-@ class call girl .
who fought back and got punished for it .
blunt @-@ force trauma , same bruise on the thighs ...
this is the most violent
and shortest time between kills .
feels like he is trying to break some kind of record .
this team has a complicated dynamic .
ultimatly , they trust one another , but they still call independent .
sounds like any disfunctional relationship .
how do we narrow that down ?
through her . the more we can learn about julie ,
the better we can understand why they are doing this .
did you see what he did to her ?
it wasn &apos;t any worse than the others .
it was as bad as the coed .
ohh ! will you let that go !
we &apos;ve given him everything he wants .
i can &apos;t keep doing this .
what do you want to do , stop ?
she said he &apos;s getting stronger .
what if he can walk again ?
you know what the chances are .
well , he &apos;s always been exceptional .
i &apos;m not giving up on him .
scrub !
use your scrub brush .
we &apos;re looking for a pair of white males
in their late 20s to early 30s ,
who &apos;ve developed a pattern of overkill followed by remorse .
this usually points to a dominant @-@ submissive partnership .
the submissive follows the rules , knows the dominant &apos;s type ,
obtains the victims and disposes of the body
once the dominant has completed his killing ritual .
what is the ritual ?
it most likely involves some form of bondage .
all of the victims have identical bruises on their thighs ,
but we &apos;re not sure if that &apos;s done during capture or kill .
there &apos;s no sexual assault , which tells us the dominant
is likely impotent or is experimenting
with other forms of sexual release .
we often refer to this as a thrill kill .
the dominant is inducing pain and creating terror
without a sexual element .
this provides him stimulation and excitement .
like an adrenaline rush .
exactly . the thrill of the murder is only a temporary fix .
like any narcotic ,
the violence satisfies his senses for a time ,
but then it fades .
this is likely why his cooling @-@ off period is nonexistent .
despite a public investigation ,
the unsubs have continued killing .
the risk of getting caught does not trump their need to kill .
we &apos;re moving on to the next round of &quot; go the limit . &quot;
all right , come on .
i just love this game .
all right . are you ready to play our bonus round ?
ready as i can be .
ok . now , mary ellen ...
i want another one .
we have to talk about this , son .
what is there to talk about ?
well , uh , how are you feeling ?
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
your father &apos;s just trying to ask you .
we made a deal when you moved back in
that as long as you &apos;re under our roof , you will take your meds .
well , they mess me up !
look , if this is your way of trying to kick me out ,
just come out and say it .
we &apos;re not trying to kick you out .
we &apos;ll ask the doctor about changing your prescription ,
but for now you have to take your meds .
it &apos;s been a couple of weeks .
how dare you !
just because she &apos;s been popping pills my entire life
doesn &apos;t mean i have to !
that is enough !
you &apos;re drunk , aren &apos;t you , dad ?
that &apos;s ok . i don &apos;t blame you ,
for being married to her .
i said that is enough !
or what ?
what are you gonna do that she hasn &apos;t already ruined ?
we &apos;re doing the best we can .
you &apos;re not doing enough .
you really want to help me ?
then you &apos;ll put me out of my misery .
ok , sugar lump . i got
all the information on the latest victim ,
and it turns out you were half right .
julie harmon was a sexual surrogate .
they help people get their get @-@ it @-@ on on .
it &apos;s like having a hall pass with your therapist .
does she have a list of patients ?
oh , i &apos;m sure she does , but i can &apos;t find anything electronically .
she probably had a little black book .
you know , luddite like .
all right . thank you , mama .
julie harmon was a sexual surrogate .
whoa ! sounds like somebody felt a little progressive prescription
might fix everything .
well , they were wrong .
that &apos;s not just going
from high- to low @-@ risk victims .
a sexual surrogate &apos;s a very specific type .
it &apos;s like they were trying to fix something .
why else would you call a therapist ?
they do treat patients with all types of disabilities ,
whether it &apos;s developmental ,
physical , or emotional .
well , my guess is this guy had all 3 .
let &apos;s look at the physical .
he &apos;s got the upper @-@ body strength to kill .
but the victims &apos; bruises
tells us that he was using restraints .
only they &apos;re not around the hands and feet ,
where you &apos;d typically restrain a victim .
they &apos;re tramline bruises around the thighs .
it &apos;s as if the victims are straddling a chair .
physical infirmity , strong arms .
what if the unsub &apos;s in a wheelchair ?
that would explain the van parked in the loading zone .
handicap permits grant access all over the city .
i &apos;ll call garcia .
we should talk to social workers , physical therapists ,
anyone who deals directly with the disabled .
given the anger and inability to perform ,
those injuries are not recent .
his explosive outbursts could be built @-@ up frustration ,
which usually manifests when
things are out of one &apos;s control , like an accident .
ok , so let &apos;s go with that .
i mean , whoever &apos;s helping
him has a definite loyalty .
responsibility , even .
the caregiver could have caused the impairment .
he &apos;s the one who has shown remorse and guilt .
he might have a sense of morality .
if that &apos;s the case ,
the best way to break up a partnership
is to drive a wedge between them .
and the key to doing that is to tell the caregiver he &apos;s forgiven .
give him the strength to leave .
i &apos;ll tell agent brooks to organize a press conference .
and we would like to appeal to this individual ,
whom we believe functions as a caretaker , to come forward
and allow us to help .
you can stop this from happening to others
by doing the right thing
and contacting the atlanta p.d.
we understand that you
feel a sense of loyalty towards your partner
and the need to comply with their demands ,
but if you contact us ,
we will do everything in our power
to help you both .
that was fbi agent jareau ...
it &apos;s time .
i know .
how effective are those press conferences ?
incredibly .
then why haven &apos;t we heard from him ?
a bond like this takes years to develop .
we &apos;re not going to break it in a few hours .
i &apos;m so glad you could make it .
i never turn down a home @-@ cooked meal .
these are for you .
oh , thank you . they &apos;re beautiful .
everyone &apos;s waiting for you .
everything about julie harmon &apos;s
murder was different .
it was the most violent and remorseful .
it &apos;s like the partners were each at their extremes .
all of the bodies were disposed of in a nurturing way ,
but you &apos;re right .
julie was wrapped in plastic .
it &apos;s neat .
it &apos;s almost too neat .
maybe the caretaker is a woman .
by nature , women prefer cleaner disposal methods .
i don &apos;t know . i mean ,
that terrain was something serious .
i mean , no offense , ladies , but reid and i hiked up that ridge
and there &apos;s no way a woman , physically fit or not ,
could carry dead weight all that way .
and we profiled that the partner &apos;s in a wheelchair ,
so that would make it impossible for him to help with disposal .
so there &apos;s a third person involved .
that rarely works .
it &apos;s always two against one .
they &apos;d have to trust one another completely .
so what kind of relationship involves that dynamic ?
they &apos;d have to be incredibly good friends .
or blackmailing one another .
siblings .
what if it &apos;s parents protecting a child ?
they raise them . they root for them .
they would share the same genes .
apple don &apos;t fall far from the tree .
a parent would hold themselves accountable .
that explains the guilt .
but what kind of sick family pulls this off ?
one that &apos;s probably done it before .
oh , my god .
i know . it worked .
can you believe it , mrs . collins ?
we think they have an only child .
it &apos;s unlikely a sibling
would participate in something this extreme .
if they felt responsible for his accident ,
they might have rationalized
doing anything to make him happy .
well , we doubt murder is something they planned on .
it &apos;s more like a lethal side effect of their son &apos;s condition .
if there was orbital cortex damage from the accident ,
it would help explain why killing is his release .
if the mother has psychopathic tendencies ,
she could have passed it down through the x chromosome .
garcia &apos;s looking up accidents now that have the parents at fault .
that list has to be long .
it is . so she &apos;s also looking for unsolved cases in the state .
there &apos;s a good chance this
isn &apos;t the first time the son &apos;s acted out .
the chicken &apos;s nice and tender .
i cooked it all the way through , because ,
you know , salmonella is the silent killer
that nobody wants to talk about .
so , erika , do you have a big family ?
um , i &apos;ve got two older brothers .
you &apos;re the baby .
and the only girl .
yep .
so was it loud in your house , all those boys
clomping around ?
i never knew any different .
when jeffrey would come home after a game with his friends ,
i swear they had bricks in their shoes .
they would shake the whole house .
and then donald wanted to go for a girl .
remember ?
&apos;cause he said , &quot; mama &apos;s boy . mama &apos;s boy and daddy &apos;s girl . &quot;
but i said no , because i knew that i could never love
another child as much as i love jeffrey .
i just didn &apos;t have room in my heart for anyone else .
oh , that &apos;s--that &apos;s sweet .
have you got it ?
yeah .
uh , garcia , you &apos;re on speaker .
ok , the only thing i can find that &apos;s remotely similar to this
is from 5 years ago .
a coed at georgia state was stabbed and left in a park .
did she have bruises on her inner thigh ?
uh , m.e. says ...
yes , she did .
all right , garcia , check student enrollment for that year
for students with campus handicap permits .
i got a bushelful of matches . let &apos;s narrow this down .
look for in @-@ state residents .
if the unsub was injured ,
there &apos;s a good chance he stayed close to home .
they &apos;re all locals .
the parents would have covered it up
and they would have pulled their son out of school after the murder .
here we go . jeffrey collins .
he dropped out of school weeks after the murder
and has since lived with his parents .
what &apos;s his story ?
sending it to you right now .
he &apos;s the only child of linda and donald collins ,
who &apos;s local athtele who became paralyzed
when he was in a car accident when he was 15 .
it says here the mother was driving ,
but the injuries weren &apos;t consistent
with being behind the wheel .
but the father &apos;s were . look .
broken ribs , ruptured spleen ,
minor concussion .
he &apos;s obviously the one who hit the steering wheel .
let me guess . the father was drunk .
yeah . twice the legal limit .
sounds like they switched places and she covered for him .
but helping your husband avoid a dui is far different
than helping your son dispose of bodies .
not necessarily . the mother fixes things .
she could have manipulated the husband
into making up for his failure .
garcia , you got an address ?
sending it to you now .
that was good .
did you like it ?
yeah , i did .
do you want to watch something else ?
actually , i &apos;m feeling kind of tired .
well , you &apos;ve been squinting all night .
do you have one of your headaches ?
yeah .
did you take your meds today ?
you can &apos;t stop taking those , you know .
are they still in your room ?
yes , but my dad can get them .
that &apos;s ok . i can get them .
what is this ?
why is there blood under the bed ?
you really shouldn &apos;t be in here .
there &apos;s blood . why is there blood ?
i &apos;m his mother .
i would have gotten the pills .
we were on our way to the collins home when we received the call .
donald collins was behind the wheel . died on impact .
we found this in his coat pocket .
he confessed to all 4 murders .
even in death he &apos;s still covering for his son .
no one else in the car ?
no .
no skid marks . he probably hit the pole going about 65 mph .
he committed suicide .
it looks like he was trying to replicate the accident
that made jeff a paraplegic .
this was his ultimate penance .
is this their endgame ?
if he was trying to replicate the accident ,
jeff and linda would have both been in the car .
so where are they ?
when someone invites you over ,
you come in , you eat , you smile ,
but then you leave .
the flowers were a really nice touch .
but obviously the rest of your manners are lacking .
what the hell are you doing ?
i gotta get her out of here .
she has nothing to do with this .
somebody help me .
she found out , and i &apos;m not about to let her ruin everything .
i &apos;m sorry . i know you really liked her ,
but i &apos;ll find you someone else , ok ?
help me !
fbi !
put the gun down .
listen , mrs . collins , we need you to put down your weapon .
get the hell out of my house !
get my dad . he &apos;ll tell you she &apos;s crazy .
your father was killed in a car accident .
what ?
did he tell you what he did ?
he killed all those girls , that sick son of a bitch .
linda , this is over . jeff is coming with us .
he &apos;s not going anywhere .
your dad took his own life
because he couldn &apos;t stand to be a part of this anymore .
he couldn &apos;t stand the guilt . he &apos;s a drunk .
look what he did to my son !
look what he did to my boy !
you did this . she &apos;s lying .
you need to let him take responsibility .
we know that jeff hurt those girls .
you people . you think you &apos;re gonna come in here
and you &apos;re just gonna take my son
and you &apos;re gonna lock him up like some animal !
linda , put it down .
mom .
i always told you
that mommy would take care of everything .
it &apos;s ok .
&quot; live so that when your children think of fairness and integrity ,
they think of you . &quot;
h. jackson brown jr .
i know there &apos;s no handbook ,
but what kind of parents do that for their kid ?
well , the collinses obviously had issues before jeffrey ,
but the accident and his paralysis
pushed it over the edge .
i guess so .
so , what time should i pick up jack tomorrow ?
i have to leave by 5 a.m.
ok . well , i tell you what .
you put on the coffee and i &apos;ll be there .
thanks .
so you nervous ?
i mean , it &apos;s not too late to back out .
