"Idle Hands"
Work keeps our minds active.
It keeps us out of trouble.
13 seconds to run a low-exposure, high-resolution, full-body
X-ray.
When this E.R. Reopens tomorrow,
this thing is gonna save us time, money, and lives.
Say that first part again.
What, 13 seconds for a full-body x-ray?
We're gonna be able to do a complete evaluation
of, uh, G.S.W.s, stabbings, crush injuries,
without ever having to leave this E.R.
Do you like your new toy?
Yeah.
Then shut up and thank me for it.
When we're not working, our hands are idle,
and the devil will find work for idle hands to do.
Need any help?
Nope.
Uh, it's on. You ready?
Obviously I won't be wearing it
with a t-shirt and underwear.
Oh, no, no, no.
You should only wear it with a t-shirt and underwear.
Or nothing...
Would be even better.
Okay, I have to practice walking on it for a while...
if I want to wear it to work.
Yeah, totally.
And when you have an idle mind,
well, that's the devil's playground, too.
It was wet and cold. I got the flu.
And I couldn't wait to go again.
That was the first time I went fly-fishing.
Has he stopped kicking?
For the moment.
Her eyesight is developing this week.
Unless it's not. Unless she's blind.
She's not blind. Or he's not.
Or if he or she is blind, that's fine.
Blind is fine.
What do we call it, "It"?
One of us can say "He," one of us can say "She,"
and we're covered.
Well, no, because then it's gonna be born
thinking one of us is always wrong.
Well, maybe it can't hear anyway.
Maybe it's deaf.
Deaf is fine.
Helen Keller went to Harvard, Meredith.
Okay, well, what if it's not fine?
What if it's absorbed twin body?
Two heads, extra arms--
Stop.
I'm just saying,
if anyone's gonna have a baby with two heads and three arms
and 11 toes, it's gonna be me.
Would you just go to sleep? Please.
Sleep.
And we own a hospital.
Yeah, we have for several weeks now.
Yeah, but today it has an E.R. and, uh, coffee sleeves
with the new logo on them.
We needed the coffee sleeves, right?
They're a good expense?
Oh, yeah, for branding. Mm-hmm.
We had a 17-hour meeting about it.
I love the new logo. It really catches the eye.
And, uh, these coffee sleeves-- excellent thermal retention.
What's up with the sheet?
I thought you guys put it there for some kind of unveiling.
No.
Well, somebody should say a few words, right?
I mean, it's unlucky not to.
Hey, why are you guys staring at the wall?
Oh, we're waiting for the... big unveiling.
Mm. Well, you should be staring at my wife.
New haircut?
No. It's her leg. She's weing high heels.
Because she has a sexy high-heel leg
that makes her ass go pow.
Baby got back.
Mm-hmm. Come on, guys.
You can comment, too. You have permission.
It's the one time in your life you can say it... no.
And, uh, not be gross.
Well, I think it's a fine gluteal--
Oh, no. Yeah. Let's just do the unveiling.
Um, guys, I think the painters actually just left that there.
Let's get back to work.
End of speech.
Awesome.
We are awesome. Did you see our picture in this?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
I'm at 28 weeks and I am worried about digeorge syndrom.
Digeogre? There's like, what,
a 1 in 100,000?
It's too rare.
More likely it'll have a cleft palate
or a heart defect.
Wait, if your baby has a heart defect,
I will fix it.
What about phenylketonuria?
No, we screen for that at birth and treat it with diet.
What about a giant hemangioma?
Like a huge, out-of-control bloodsucker?
Now that's a possibility.
Or maybe a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation.
Again, I will operate and do a lung transplant.
We own a hospital--
"A cutting-edge, research-oriented hospital
with an advanced level-I trauma center."
Whatever's wrong with your baby, we will fix it.
But you agree, there's definitely something wrong?
Oh, my god. Marcus Cho?
Who's Marcus Cho?
Uh, uh, he's like a high-functioning moron
who was a year behind me at Stanford.
And he just got published with his attending for...
No. No.
For what?
Robot-assisted surgery for mitral valve regurgitation!
He looks kinda smart.
He's a moron.
I heard there was an O.B.
using forceps during a breech delivery.
Pulled a little too hard and...
Pop.
Now that's what I'm talking about.
We'll let these fluids go in for a few hours
and then, uh, set you up for chemo this afternoon.
Who's gonna set me up, you
or Dr. Wilson?
Dr. Wilson.
She's been begging for more time with you.
Did you cry?
I have that effect on the ladies.
I'll bet you do.
Hey.
Hey, sorry. You got a sec?
Yeah. Uh, Pablo, this is Dr. Myers.
Hey, what's up, Pablo?
I just want to say, I have that c-section in 20
if you wanted to watch, unless you're busy.
Watch you actually do a real surgery?
Yeah, you can criticize my scalpel technique,
which is awesome.
Dr. Karev?
Uh... we're slow. I don't care.
Whoa.
Uh, this popped out.
Is that bad? Sorry.
Hey, don't sweat it, little man.
I'm not little. I'm 12.
My growth was stunted by a lifetime of cancer.
I'll check in later.
Okay?
Did you do that on purpose?
Is she going out with that nozzle?
I hate him.
Well, the guy's a doctor. You can't do that.
You know what else we should do?
What?
And get to know the new electronic board.
It automatically updates the location of your patients
and any labs that have been ordered.
And we now have workstations at every bed,
which are fully integrated with the new charting system.
And the beds are now numbered differently,
so just pay attention.
And now what you have all been waiting for...
the Lodox--
Low-dose radiation x-ray statscanner.
It provides full-body anterior and lateral views.
The low radiation makes imaging safer
for children and pregnant women.
It is our most cutting-edge tool
in diagnostic technology.
Murphy.
When can we use it?
Oh! I'll volunteer.
When I was 6, I stuck a marble up my nose,
and it never came out.
We checked my stool for over a year.
Listen, this is not a toy.
I know we all want to see this thing in action.
But be patient.
The last thing we need is some line forming
when some real trauma comes in.
Chief Hunt, we've got an A.T.V. accident
two minutes out.
And here we go.
Oh, Dr. Avery.
Hey, I know you've been thinking about
raising the profile of the hospital.
Not today, Dr. Bailey.
Today I am going to the E.R.
to find something to operate on.
Well, I have a proposal
for a Grey Sloan human genome mapping program
that'll cost less than Chicago's program.
No money. We spent it on the new E.R.
Okay, if you and the other board members
would just read over the--
I am a doctor today, Bailey.
Hmm. Okay. Okay.
What have we got?
16-year-old female. A.T.V. collision.
G.C.S. is 6.
Open depressed skull fracture with active bleeding.
Whoa. Let's take her to Lodox.
Get a statscan before we take her to trauma.
They're using the Lodox.
The lodox?
Oh, someone say "Lodox"?
Got here just in time.
Sweet. This is gonna be great.
All right, everyone.
Let's get ready for this transfer.
All right, on my count.
Hold on.
She's bleeding through these bandages.
Ross, A.B.P. pads.
Got it.
Uh... it looks like it's a branch of the M.C.A.
Pressure's not gonna tamponade it.
We need to get her straight to the O.R.
Uh, page Shepherd. Ross, you're on this.
She's right here.
What about the Lodox?
She needs an intraoperative C.T.
It'll only take 13 seconds.
We don't have 13 seconds to spare.
She could stroke out at any second. Let's move!
Let's go!
You guys want to look for my marble?
Mr. Kramer.
Our best neurosurgeon-- Dr. Shepherd--
just started operating on your daughter.
You're gonna fix her, right?
Well, she sustained a lot of damage to the brain.
Since she wasn't wearing a helmet--
She was wearing a helmet.
We have been riding every weekend
since she was 13 years old.
I would never let her near a bike without one.
We--we stopped to take a picture.
She took her helmet off for a minute,
and that idiot comes flying out of nowhere.
I swear to god, I am gonna hunt that son of a bitch down
and I am gonna crack his skull open.
We're gonna do everything we can--
So what are you standing here for?
Get in there!
Dr. Yang, you got a sec?
Um, I don't. I'm looking for Dr. Russell.
Well, I'm looking for funding.
Ugh. You're pitching me now?
Yeah. You're on the board.
And I have been postponing research
to write policy to become, like, a lawyer,
while people like Marcus Cho are out there doing it.
We should be doing it.
Don't you want this hospital
to be on the cutting edge of medical research?
Exactly. We're on the same page.
Okay. Then you'll fund my genome project.
What? No.
I need to find some badass,
earth-shattering cardio research I can get in on.
Okay--
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
Dr. Russell, I need to be put to work.
I need to know what research projects you have pending--
Great. What are you doing this afternoon?
I think I have just the procedure for you.
I got a page.
I'm sorry. Do you know who needed a G.Y.N. consult?
No, I don't know.
Ahh. Dr. Grey.
Do you need a G.Y.N.?
Nope.
Then who paged me?
Can I help you?
Well, I noticed your patient has acute abdominal pain.
Any chest pains?
Because if you wanted to put her through the Lodox
for a full body scan, you could.
If you wanted,
You know, to... use the Lodox.
Do I need a full body scan?
It only takes 13 seconds.
No, you don't.
No Lodox. Thank you.
So recently, the pain has been getting worse?
I thought I had the stomach flu.
I drown myself in that sanitizer stuff,
but when you're teaching kids,
oh, they're just little germ bags.
Ah, I've been out for a week.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, it's been great for me.
I haven't taken a day off in 28 years.
You know how many, um, cooking shows they have now?
I don't.
It turns out, I love watching people cook things.
And then this morning, the pain was so bad,
I couldn't move, so I-I called the ambulance.
Okay, Madeline, so from what I'm seeing here,
it looks like gallstones.
Oh, god. Does that mean surgery?
It does.
But the good news is, we can do it laparoscopically,
which means no big incisions
and very little recovery time.
And I'll take them out, and you'll be on your way.
Well, I get to watch some more people cook stuff.
Okay, so I'm gonna get them started on admitting you.
You just sit tight.
Great. Thank you.
Did you just update your patient file?
Watch this.
So cool!
You do get excited about things.
Yes, I do. Hey, how's that baby?
Oh, it probably has three arms and a tail.
How's your paramedic boyfriend?
Terrible.
I mean, um, great.
Perfect. Just not--
I probably have to break up with him.
Why?
Okay, are-- are you really asking?
Because I really need to talk about this.
Well, now I'm not sure I'm asking.
Okay. Uh, Matthew's never...
been to the carnival.
And he thinks that I haven't either
because that's what I told him, but I have.
I'm sorry.
And you want to go to the carnival together?
Because I've been already and I... rode the rides.
You went to the carnival with Jackson.
I have ridden the rides...
and they are good--
The tilt-a-whirl and then
that one that spins around
when your back is up against the wall
and then the floor falls out from underneath your feet.
And I want Matthew to go with me,
but he wants to wait,
which is... why he's perfect,
because that's what I want.
I always wanted to wait, but I didn't wait.
And now I just--
every night push him closer and closer.
And I feel like I'm just gonna slip
and buy him a ticket and shove him on the tilt-a-whirl,
and then he's gonna love it, and I will have corrupted him.
And I-I'm not a corrupter.
Well, I don't know why you're talking to me about this.
I am a big fan of the carnival
and I go every chance I get.
Yes, I know, but--
Okay, so your whole thing is,
God has a plan, right?
Yeah.
Well, there must be a reason
why God let you go to the carnival already.
Maybe you're supposed to take Matthew.
You're right, I should not be talking to you about this.
Fancy new E.R.,
and all I've done is splint a pinkie?
This is why we bought a hospital?
Uh, hey. If--if we get off...
at a decent time, um, and we put Sofia down early,
and I could make dinner, and we could, um...
Really?
Really.
So...
You think tonight?
Is definitely the night.
For sex, right? We're talking about sex?
The sexy night.
Okay.
Ladies, hey, just the two people I was looking for.
Uh, walk away, Bailey.
No, no, I need to speak to board members,
and I remember you all giving me some kind of crap
about how the door's always open, so--
Oh, but right now it's closed.
One minute.
It's the wrong minute.
Are you kidding me?
Okay, what happened to the new hospital,
run by doctors, all about doctors?
Okay, well, it-- what happened is,
my wife's new leg is making her feel sexy.
And we haven't had sex in a long time.
I mean, we've done stuff, don't get me wrong.
But we haven't done other stuff.
And other stuff is happening tonight.
So that's what we were talking about
when you interrupted us--
Walking away.
You warned her.
I did.
Uh, Meredith Grey,
I want to talk to you about human genome mapping.
Right now?
Yes, right now.
I'm operating.
Exactly. I have you cornered.
You can't walk away
or start talking about the sexual antics
you're going to engage in tonight.
But you can listen.
Bailey.
Now!
Genetic mapping can lead us to developing
targeted therapies for diseases.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes, precision medicine,
where we treat illness at its molecular source
instead of just dealing with the consequences.
What's this?
What it is is the future of medicine.
It's a way that we--
No, Bailey. Shut up.
Please. You're removing a gallstone.
You can do that in your sleep.
No, it's not gallstones.
Oh. It's calcified.
Okay, well, you'll need to do a biopsy
and maybe open her up.
But don't think the worst.
This is a hard mass.
This is cancer.
Oh, crap. It's spread to the liver.
Oh, if she was teaching until last week,
it can't be that bad.
All right, if we resect part of the liver
maybe we can get it all.
It's worth a try.
Oh, look at that.
It's encasing the hepatic artery and the bile duct.
We could continue,
but we can't take the artery.
It's unresectable.
Well, let's finish up and close.
You have to take that much off?
I need the exposure.
Oh, there's more damage than we could see on the C.T.
It's been a few hours.
I'd really like to get an update to the father.
Okay, but just so you know, he's kind of a big, angry maniac.
Oh, you can handle it.
Of course.
I'll just make sure security's close by.
Look, Ross, this is an arena in which I know you excel.
Just start with the positive news,
be confident,
and don't make any promises you can't keep.
You're my voice out there.
I'll channel you. It'll be fine.
I'm Derek Shepherd.
It's a beautiful day to save lives.
I'll channel you in my own voice.
Thank you.
This is the lotus valve.
We're doing a lotus valve.
This is the lotus valve.
50% of people with aortic valve defects
don't survive a year after diagnosis.
But the lotus valve is noninvasive.
It minimizes aortic regurge, doesn't need, uh, balloon inflation
or rapid pacing of the heart,
so less stress on the body, less blood loss, less--
Well, you're obviously up to speed.
I've been dying to get in on this
ever since you started testing.
Outstanding.
The results of phase two have been amazing.
Phase three should be a hoot.
God, you can retract and resheath before you deploy.
Exactly. That's the best thing about it.
You have total control over the entire procedure.
It's incredibly flexible
if you don't get it right the first time.
But I imagine you will.
M-me?
I wondered if you might like to try your hand at placing the valve.
Oh, my god. Yes.
Thank you, sir.
Dr. Jason Myers to the E.R.
Dr. Jason Myers to the E.R.
Nobody's tried it yet?
No, not yet.
That is sad. This is a beautiful machine.
It is sad.
It's like a carnival ride with all the lights turned off,
Just sitting there going to waste.
It would be so fun--
And it cost us a lot of money
just to be pretty.
Oh, why would god present us with this gorgeous thing,
just put it right in front of us,
and then want us not to use it?
I... don't think god was involved.
The board paid for it, so--
And we definitely want it to get used.
Okay, one of you two paged me, right?
No, I didn't.
Nope.
He went to the E.R.
Then ortho, then back to the E.R.,
and then he went to the cafeteria.
The cafeteria? What a tool.
Yeah. Dr. Jason Myers to proctology.
Oh, wait. Listen.
Dr. Jason Myers to proctology.
All right.
Well, that was fun, but I have
actual doctor work to do.
Damn.
I got a great idea for the next one.
Come on.
But if you want to deny my dying cancer wish...
So I-I'm gonna die from this?
Is that what you're saying?
There is no cure
for nonresectable late-stage gallbladder cancer.
Chemo may give you more time,
but it has not been shown to provide a cure.
I'm sorry.
Ms. Skurski?
You guys, what are-- what are you doing here?
Mr. Arnold said you were in the hospital.
Dr. Grey, these are some of my students,
who are supposed to be at their after-school study session now
with their substitute.
What are you doing here?
Mr. Arnold sucks.
Lucas, we don't say "Sucks."
Sorry. He's just a jerk.
He sends, like, five people a day to the principal's office.
And we never get free time,
even after we finish our homework.
And his breath smells really bad.
You're coming back soon, right?
Of course.
Don't worry.
I'm, uh...
I'll be good as new really soon.
Isn't that right, Dr. Grey?
Yes.
Yes, that's right.
The good news is her vitals have been stable.
But her injuries are extensive.
We'll be operating for several more hours.
Wait. Wait. What does that mean, extensive?
Uh, it's hard to say.
Susie's suffered damage to the parts of her brain
that control speech, motor functions--
She's paralyzed?
My--my little girl is paralyzed?
No, no, I mean,
paralysis is a possibility,
but we can't tell what kind of deficits she'll have until she wakes--
What kind of things are you expecting? How bad?
There might not be any.
Which one is it, are there or aren't there?
At this time, it's too early--
You said she might not be able to speak.
We don't know--
What the hell do you know?
I know this must be scary for you--
Damn right,
because you don't know anything.
Don't talk to me
till you know what's going on,
or get me someone who does!
I know I shouldn't have lied right in my kids' faces.
I kinda pride myself on not doing that.
I just couldn't tell them. I just couldn't.
Maybe...
there's a way to help prepare them.
Maybe it would make you feel better.
I teach them science and math.
I teach them things that make sense,
and this doesn't make sense.
I-I...
Yesterday, I was... watching TV.
I was happy
to have a little break from school,
And today, I...
I'm probably not even gonna make it to finals.
Their parents will have to tell them.
I... I... or Mr. Arnold.
I-I just don't know what I would say.
This sucks!
We don't say "Sucks,"
But this sucks.
I only have a dog bite and two patients with the flu.
I have a sprained ankle.
Yeah, let's do that. Get him in the machine.
He doesn't need a full body scan.
It's a really bad sprain.
I have a stomachache.
Stomachache could be a tumor, kidney stones.
No, I have a stomachache.
We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on that thing,
And it's just sitting there.
Okay, how bad is the sprain?
What?
That ass does not quit.
These heels are killing me.
What was I thinking?
I mean, heels were a pain even before I had a plastic leg.
Why'd I think it'd be better now?
Can I take a look?
Nope.
Oh, well, I just might be able to help.
Mm. You're not my doctor. You're my wife.
Here we go.
What?
Uh, we're not gonna have sex tonight.
Wh--I--who said--
Who said that we're not gonna have sex tonight?
That's what you're saying.
You just told me your leg hurts,
So that tonight when I put on
my drop-dead gorgeous underwear,
you're gonna tell me to change into my sweats.
And then when I look disappointed,
you're gonna say, "Please don't make that face, Callie.
You know that my leg's been bothering me today."
And...
What kind of manipulative bitch do you think I am?
You're not manipulative and you're not a bitch.
Okay? I'm a bitch. Yeah.
You are uncomfortable like you have been
for a very long time now,
and if I were a really good person,
I would continue to be patient,
but apparently, I'm not.
A G.Y.N. patient just came in.
This time I have a name. Talia.
If you can find her, you can treat her.
I'm looking for a Ms. Talia.
A Jenny Talia.
I'm here to see Jenny Talia.
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
Karev.
A moment.
What the hell are you doing?
Dr. Webber, I was--
Out of all the childish,
sophomoric things to do to someone,
this may be the most pathetic.
Come on. Look at the kid.
He lives in this hospital. He never gets to have any fun.
What's the big deal?
The big deal is, I thought you were better than this.
Jenny Talia?
You need to up your game.
You're cutting right into her frontal lobe.
Calm down, Ross.
Her whole personality could be affected.
Her memory could be gone,
and that man out there is gonna kill me.
Did I ever tell you the first time I went fly-fishing?
No.
Yeah, I went out to the Hoh River to fish winter steelhead.
For hours, I tried to cast like I'd practiced.
But if you over try, it'll never happen.
And then just once,
the rod loaded perfectly.
The line formed a tight loop,
and the fly just danced out over the river about 70 feet.
It had a life of its own.
See, the key was to relax,
Feel the rhythm, and let the rod do the work.
Just one perfect cast.
Why'd you tell me that?
Did it calm you down?
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Right now I am about to remove a hematoma
from Broca's area.
And if I am not careful, she'll never speak again.
There is a lot to be afraid of.
Patients will be afraid. Parents will be afraid.
And the only way to get through it
is for you to stay calm.
The brain is swelling.
What are we gonna do about that?
We're gonna...
We're gonna give her more mannitol.
Good.
That was amazing.
The valve started operating before I fully released it.
Incredible, right?
And almost no paravalvular leakage?
Revolutionary technology,
and the rate of success with phase two
has been astounding.
Well, when do we start phase three?
Well, that's up to you, really.
Up to me?
You're--you're giving phase three to me?
No. No.
It's my trial.
I don't need another surgeon.
What I need from you is $12 million
So I can keep it going, for patient recruitment,
research staff, lab space.
I want to make Grey-Sloan the premier destination
for this procedure.
I thought you were bringing me on to this.
You're-- you're pitching me.
It's nice to finally have someone on the board
who gets what I'm doing.
This is exactly what I was afraid of.
The administrative crap is taking over my career.
Russell called me "someone on the board."
I mean, he doesn't even see me as a surgeon.
I'm just someone who cuts budgets.
Ugh. Stop kicking in there.
I mean, what are you, choking on your cord or something?
Cristina, please talk to it.
He or she.
Who?
The baby.
No.
The sound of my voice only makes it kick harder.
For some reason, Derek can calm it down.
Maybe you can, too.
You know, I'll talk to it when I see it.
When she gets her first period.
I'll take that off your plate.
Or if it has a penis,
I'll tell him not to think with it.
Ow. Cristina, please just talk to it.
Hello.
This is... Cristina...
Yang.
I don't know. What do you want me to say?
Anything. Just talk.
Oh, get up.
Hey, uh, this is Miranda Bailey.
I am an excellent surgeon and a forward thinker.
Your mother's a surgeon. Your father is a surgeon.
You'll very likely want to be one, too.
But I'm hoping by the time it's your turn,
there will be very little surgery left
because Human Genome Mapping
will have given people information
so that they can fight their diseases before they happen.
Keep talking. It's working.
Um, armed with information,
people will be able to live longer, healthier lives.
Now I know this is a very expensive undertaking,
but maybe if you hadn't spent so much money
on coffee sleeves and new logos,
there'd be money in the budget
to fund a forward thinker like me.
I think she's talking to us now.
Look, here is my proposal,
which I've made to you
because you're in charge.
Which is messed up, but I'm not gonna go there
because I want your money.
We are in charge.
I am in charge.
I am gonna crush Marcus Cho
because I am in charge.
Wait. Don't leave. I--
Hey, Cristina, please talk to it.
Ow.
Okay, right.
O-okay.
That was the ambulance from earlier.
They thought they left one of their backboards here.
They found it.
All right. Brooks.
Whoa. What are you doing?
Hop in.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Let's find that marble, and the rest of you,
line up and watch.
At the very least, we're going to figure out
how to run this damn thing.
Chief, we got a motorcycle accident coming in.
Extensive crush injuries.
Hop out.
But it only takes 13 seconds.
Out now. And the rest of you, let's prep for incoming.
Is that a specimen cup?
Did you place a warm cup of pee next to me?
It's my urine sample.
What, should I go put it on your desk?
If you want to die.
But the memo says that you're in charge
of the random drug test policy.
Okay, whatever drugs you are doing, stop!
What was that about?
Uh, that's what happens when the hospital's slow.
The doctors start punking each other.
Oh. Well, I just wanted to let you know
that we found funding for your project.
Oh, I get it.
You popular kids are punking me,
like this is some high school volleyball team.
Well, I do not want to play varsity that bad, Kimberly.
Bailey, you get your genome lab, for real.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, Cristina just assembled a quick board meeting.
Now we haven't dotted all the i's or crossed all the t's yet,
But it looks like you're gonna get your funding.
But Avery said there wasn't any more money.
Yeah, well, one of the other departments cut their budget.
You're cutting my budget?
Just by a couple million.
I asked you for more money, not less.
I'll have to lose a resident, a-a research assistant--
Probably two...
Of each. Sorry.
Wait. Wait.
What does that leave me with?
It leaves you with me.
To do the work of four people?
I am the best four people
you will ever have working for you.
I will treat your patients, take your surgeries,
and assist in research,
including projects I find on my own.
Feel free to pile it on.
But I can't possibly--
Oh, the board believes you can.
I told Bailey she's getting her genome lab.
She was so happy. She looked great.
That's fantastic.
Hey, are you okay?
I'm just-- I'm really happy for Bailey.
No, you're in pain. You've been standing all day.
Here. Sit down.
You know, I really-- I don't--
I don't want to keep saying yes
and then not following through with it, okay?
I-I really don't.
No, I'm a jerk for putting pressure on you.
You know what? I think that I can try.
I can try. It's just--I need to adjust this thing.
Let me help.
Callie, don't.
I am an orthopedic surgeon.
Let me try.
Give me your hands.
Now. Can you remove your pants, please?
Okay, I got you.
Whoa. That's not fixing it.
That's-- that's taking it off!
Look at me.
Look at me.
I'm gonna put my hand on your leg.
No, Callie. Don't.
The prosthetic is not the problem.
Your leg's your problem.
I deal with residual limbs every single day.
It's... they get sore.
Is that okay?
It feels better.
You know I could, um...
I could give you a massage, too.
With your girlie hands? Forget it.
Thank you, Callie.
Hey. Right now I'm Dr. Torres.
This came for you.
But... I don't know if you want to see it.
It's not my call.
They're here, aren't they?
A lot of them. They're in the lobby.
But I can also say that you can't have visitors.
Three, two, one.
All right. He's all set.
Avery, would you do the honors?
Six, seven,
eight, nine,
ten,
eleven, twelve
thirteen
Look at that.
It's worth every penny.
You can see the fractures of both legs.
And of the proximal aspect of the right radius and ulna
all in the same x-ray.
It would've taken, like,
15 scans to get that much information before.
It's freakin' magical.
Mm. It was definitely worth waiting for.
Let's get him out of there.
Are you ready?
Good news first, stay calm.
Can I hear the fishing story one more time?
Come on.
What took you so long?
Mr. Kramer, the good news is, your daughter's alive.
Until she wakes up
No, no, no.
No, don't, don't, don't, don't you do that!
Look, sir, please!
You're not gonna tell me that. You do not--
No!
Listen!
Your daughter...
Your daughter is alive, you hear me?
Listen to me.
Your daughter is alive.
She's alive.
And we hope she's gonna wake up,
but we don't know what's gonna happen.
Okay? Her vitals are stable.
But it doesn't do you or her any good
to be afraid of what we don't know.
Let's get cleaned up, and you can go see her, okay?
She always wears a helmet.
She...
I make sure.
I know.
I always...
I know.
I know.
Mr. Arnold always yells.
Well, he's probably frustrated.
I-I know you don't like him because he's not me.
But--but you didn't like me at first,
did you?
But at least you gave us free time
if we finished our homework.
Maybe you should tell him
that that's how I did it,
and that it motivated you.
If...
If, um...
Mr. Arnold were-- were going to be your teacher
for the rest of the year,
what else could you do to--to help him?
Someone could offer him a mint.
That's a great idea.
But not in a mean way,
just--just casually, right?
What else?
Don't skip after-school study sessions?
You got it.
But he's not gonna be our teacher
for the rest of the year,
is he?
You're not gonna come back,
are you?
What would happen if I didn't?
It'd suck.
Sorry.
No, you're right.
It'd suck.
Now...
What else can we do to help mr. Arnold?
Come on. Help me think.
What happened to cool and calm?
Yeah, well, that never would've worked with a guy like this.
Sometimes you gotta shake the hell out of 'em.
Hey. You ready?
Yeah. Page me with updates.
Rough one?
Very.
Me, too.
How's the baby, still kicking?
Quiet now. Probably dead.
Oh, Meredith, stop.
Well, I' m just kidding.
Mostly.
Really, I need you to stop.
Bad things happen,
and it just makes me feel better
to be prepared when they do.
But you don't know how things are gonna turn out.
Right. Exactly what I'm saying.
We own a hospital full of machines.
Let's go find out everything we can.
He actually gave Dr. Bailey his pee.
Anybody find out about this,
I'm throwing you under the bus.
You're not scared of this guy.
No, I'm scared of Dr. Bailey.
Hey, Karev.
Think he's onto us?
That was pretty funny today.
Uh, the--the pranks, the drug test, the pages...
You guys, you really got me.
Yeah, well, the kid's got a little crush on, uh, Wilson.
We were just having a little fun.
Oh, the kid does. Right.
Well, you two kids have fun laughing about it later
while I'm nailing Jo in the bathroom at the bar.
At first, idleness can seem like a welcome distraction--
the troublemaking and the fun.
She is asleep.
Holy Mother of--
Could you, um, massage my leg again?
Uh-huh. Yeah.
A little higher.
There?
Mm. Nope.
Higher.
Everyone needs some idle time
to focus on something other than work...
Even if it means focusing on something
that's a little bit scary.
Are you nervous?
No. Just take a look, and then we'll know.
Ohh. Is there a huge teratoma growing out of its head?
See for yourself.
Look at you.
"Avery's too young," I said.
"He's too inexperienced," I said.
"He has no business running this hospital."
Where you going with this, Bailey?
I was wrong is where I'm going.
You all made a smart decision today.
I'm not gonna disappoint you.
Thank you.
Stepping back from work
is the only way to get perspective.
Whoa. What's all that?
Russell put me on the lotus valve trials.
I have to get through most of this tonight.
Ah, is he piling it on a little heavy?
Yes, he is.
Oh, are you gonna stay late and play with your new toys?
They're not toys.
One, two,
three, four...
But they are pretty fun.
five, six...
Oh! I see the marble.
seven...
Oh, eight...
Nine, ten.
See? Ten fingers.
And it's only after we have everything in perspective...
Eleven.
Mm. That's not a finger.
Oh. Oh, it's a boy.
that we remember where our hands truly belong.
