tell her to go away !
we are gonna be a family .
i finally remember what i did during my blackouts .
it &apos;s all because of that one memory .
you &apos;re the only person who knew how to save me .
you &apos;ve seen him before .
and i never thought i &apos;d be happy to see him again .
i &apos;ve been looking for an apprentice in my tuscan studio .
i &apos;ve been given an opportunity .
but it means i have to leave .
goodbye , mom . i will always love you .
pascal lemarchal is on his way from paris .
right on schedule .
stevie grayson is my biological mother .
maybe you should give her a chance .
i was in a rehab when i found out i was pregnant .
i couldn &apos;t be a decent mother
until i learned how to take care of myself .
i think stevie grayson visited my father in prison .
what do you think she wanted ?
she came here with secrets .
i &apos;m gonna find out every single one .
grace is at the core of tragedy .
for if there &apos;s no height at which to drop ,
no pride taken in the life lived ,
you have nothing to lose .
but once in the free fall of disgrace ...
the only way to change its momentum
is to use it to your advantage .
i forgot . tomorrow &apos;s the opening night of the opera .
mm . it &apos;s &quot; pagliacci . &quot;
one of patrick &apos;s favorites .
i &apos;m sorry he &apos;s gone .
thank you , daniel .
my only consolation is that your father won &apos;t be there .
i &apos;m sorry emily will , though .
well ...
maybe not .
because that was taken yesterday .
it was my assumption that aiden had left town
after i kicked him out of the house .
well , i &apos;m glad he stuck around
because i finally have my ticket out of this marriage .
i &apos;m just waiting for her to get home .
you know , that &apos;s the first smile i &apos;ve seen on you in a while .
may i ask you a favor ?
please give me a front @-@ row seat when you tell her .
so , you &apos;re sure she only visited him the one time ?
stevie grayson , a.k.a. stephanie pruitt ,
only checked into the visitor log once -- 1997 .
a few days later , she was busted for a d.u.i. and left for cali .
that &apos;s why i never knew .
and neither did my father .
stevie used her maiden name so he wouldn &apos;t know
that she was a grayson .
or she didn &apos;t want conrad to know that she visited him .
so the first thing we need to figure out
is whose side she &apos;s on .
if jack &apos;s trying to wrap his head around his newfound mom ...
... this is gonna blow his mind .
jack stays out of it . you know that .
well , this is his mother we &apos;re talking about .
who i can approach directly ,
given that i called her to town in the first place .
and what if you have to take her down ?
don &apos;t you think you &apos;ve done enough to jack ,
or are you prepared to destroy him all over again ?
you &apos;re testing me .
just want to make sure you &apos;re not gonna black out
and become your own worst emily .
but , seriously ,
are you sure that you don &apos;t want to bring jack into this ?
absolutely not ,
especially since i don &apos;t know what &quot; this &quot; is yet .
i had no idea your father was coming back with you .
he wasn &apos;t supposed to .
well , his arrival is burning up the gossip line .
everyone wats to know who pascal lemarchal
will bring with him to the opera tomorrow .
how do you want me to handle it ?
there &apos;s nothing to handle .
he &apos;ll be gone before the curtain rises .
i flew margaux over in my bombardier global 6000 .
great plane .
you should consider buying one ,
assuming you didn &apos;t lose everything in your divorce .
well , as you can see , i &apos;ve been acquiring assets .
by sacrificing so much .
do you mean the house or victoria ?
&apos;cause either way ,
i &apos;m happy to be free of that fading structure .
now that you &apos;ve had time to catch up ,
can we get down to business ?
actually , we &apos;re on our way to the club for a round of tennis .
your father &apos;s still smarting
from the time i beat him in saint tropez .
revisionist history ...
a grayson speciality .
我会在场的 爸爸
所以放手让我做 好吗
stevie .
hi .
it &apos;s been a while .
how have you been since last we met ?
well , i &apos;m working on things .
on myself and -- and with daniel .
well , then , i &apos;m glad you won &apos;t be needing my services .
actually , can we talk for a moment ?
thought you might want some of the good stuff
before we head off to lunch .
jack , hi .
you two know each other ?
oh , everybody knows everybody around here .
can -- can you excuse us for a second ?
of course .
emily , it was good to see you again .
yes . you , too .
what are you doing here ?
i just bumped into stevie .
right after her a.a. meeting ? seems awfully convenient .
were you hoping that i wouldn &apos;t be here ?
look , i just wanted to ask her a few questions .
i know that she &apos;s a grayson , but she was gone
long before all the stuff with your father happened .
look , you and i are finally getting back to a good place ,
and i &apos;m trying to get there with my mom , too .
please just let me have this one thing .
leave stevie out of it .
that is match !
you &apos;ve lost your touch , my friend .
i &apos;m surprised you still have your competitive spirit .
i thought you were more into frivolous games these days .
i assume you &apos;re referring to my stewardship of voulez .
using my brand to publish your memoirs --
it &apos;s beneath you .
yeah , well , i &apos;ve decided to put those on ice .
i mean , i &apos;d hate for the world to think
that my story &apos;s anywhere near over .
no , i have new aspirations .
and what are they ? the french open ?
wimbledon ?
that &apos;s always been your problem , pascal .
you &apos;re too fixated on your own continent .
and where should i be looking ?
right here , the americas , where i can shepherd
your new north american base of operations .
i mean , think about it -- a grayson / lemarchal alliance
would be something remarkable to reckon with .
i remember when we started out ,
you said i was a fool for running a media company .
well , it was a foolish thing to say .
now , information is the real seat of power ,
and voulez is just the base of the pyramid .
considering what you &apos;ve asked of me in the past ,
i think i &apos;ve done enough for you .
conrad . hmm , showing up where you don &apos;t belong .
if you remember , i got the membership in the divorce ,
hoping to avoid awkward run @-@ ins
whenever i choose to have a quiet lunch out .
i was on my way out anyway , having bested an old friend .
hmm . victoria , you remember pascal .
still losing to conrad , i see .
just tried to make him feel good about himself --
something you finally stopped doing after 25 years .
don &apos;t forget -- you &apos;re the one who introduced us , pascal .
i never have .
but now that you &apos;ve got rid of him ,
perhaps you &apos;d like to have lunch with me ?
oh , i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll figure something out .
if i remember correctly ,
you &apos;re never alone for very long .
hey , hey , hey . look who &apos;s back .
i can &apos;t believe it !
i &apos;m only away a short time , yet you &apos;ve grown so much .
how are things with the house ?
well , escrow is closing in eight days , or ...
huit jours .
your accent is ... not bad .
no ?
are you looking to impress my father ?
actually , i was looking to impress his daughter .
your french will be put to better use with me anyway ,
because i &apos;m hoping my father won &apos;t stay through tomorrow .
although , there continue to be rumors of him
going to the opera .
and i got your mother a ticket .
you -- unless you think it &apos;s too soon .
no .
no ?
no , i w-- i would love for you to meet her .
okay . fantastic .
is your ...
your father driving you nuts ?
i simply asked for a little muscle
to push conrad out .
well , instead , he flies here to play tennis ,
and i &apos;m back to being his little girl --
or at least that &apos;s how he treats me .
right .
when i first started working , my dad , like , wouldn &apos;t let me
make any of the deposits or deal with any of the vendors .
what did you do ?
well , i told him to go to hell , and i did it anyway .
and it worked out
&apos;cause he finally started trusting me to run the business .
of course ...
we ran a bar , not a multibillion @-@ dollar company .
a parent is a parent .
and you &apos;re lucky to have such a good one .
oh , you look sun @-@ kissed , conrad .
i was beating an old friend at a game of tennis --
pascal lemarchal .
he &apos;d like you -- sophisticated , smart , beautiful .
ah , but on the downside , you &apos;re happily married , right ?
about that ...
so , you had me drag stevie back here
just to stir up trouble with victoria ?
well , to be clear , i thought you were sincere
about your desire to get divorced .
but , yeah , it was a convenient way to get back
at my second ex while making amends with my first .
oh , well , from what i hear , you had nothing to make up for .
wasn &apos;t stevie on her way to rock bottom back in the day ?
while we were married , yes .
so , did something happen after your divorce ?
well , we crossed paths a few years later ,
and she tried to reinsert herself into my business --
not a good choice for anyone .
you know , in the long run , i probably did her a favor .
still ...
there you go . here &apos;s your blanket , sweet boy .
so , this margaux --
when do i get to meet her ?
how about tomorrow night ?
this must be love if you &apos;re going to the opera .
i &apos;m in .
yeah , she , uh ...
she kind of took me by surprise .
i &apos;m proud of you , jack .
moving on is a brave thing .
though i see this , and ...
i wish i &apos;d had the courage
to get back in your life sooner --
and not just because i could have met her ,
but ...
what ?
it &apos;s silly .
maybe things would have turned out different .
trust me .
what happened was gonna happen .
i met amanda &apos;s father once in prison .
i was one of the people that thought he got a raw deal .
and if you don &apos;t mind me asking ,
what did amanda believe ?
that her father was an innocent man .
and you ?
that the people who follow this path
end up hurt ... or worse .
because of my former husband and his family ?
yes .
which is why i &apos;d like to drop it .
marta .
you &apos;re requested in the study , mrs. grayson .
well , i &apos;m glad to see you finally came to your senses
and hired the staff back .
well , now that you &apos;re leaving , i figured it was time .
excuse me ?
we &apos;re getting a divorce .
as a sign of good faith ,
i &apos;ve accessed family funds to make you an offer
that should last several decades ,
since i know how much you covet our lifestyle .
it &apos;s far more than you deserve ,
but small price to pay to get you out .
yes , but according to the legal definition of adultery ,
this doesn &apos;t prove a thing .
well , we &apos;ll see about that when we haul you into court .
i can &apos;t believe this .
i forgave daniel for so much .
he shot me on the night
that should have been a dream come true
and forced me into blaming lydia davis .
i did it all for daniel .
after everything we &apos;ve been through , all of the anguish ,
who could blame me for finding comfort
in the arms of someone else ?
consider that a preview to my testimony .
i &apos;ll see you at the opera tomorrow , daniel .
you , too , victoria .
let her go .
she &apos;s trying to goad you .
i want her out .
but i thought you wanted a divorce .
oh , i &apos;ll get one when the time is right .
well , sounds like you handled it with panache .
still , i can &apos;t believe daniel had a tail on me and i didn &apos;t know it .
well , you were a little off your game at the time .
well , now that i &apos;m back ,
the last thing i need is daniel tracking my every move .
i can &apos;t afford any more wild cards .
emily grayson .
why don &apos;t you tell me who you really are ?
&quot; everybody knows everybody &quot; -- that &apos;s what you said , right ?
but was everybody the maid of honor
at amanda &apos;s wedding ?
that must have been quite the betrayal to the graysons --
you supporting a clarke --
unless you were double @-@ crossing amanda .
does jack suspect something ?
look , i don &apos;t know who you think i am ,
but i &apos;m not just another witness that you can toy with .
you call me into town under the guise of hating daniel ,
and then you claim to be happy .
i think it &apos;s pretty clear
that you haven &apos;t been honest with me since the moment we met .
why should i believe you &apos;re an ally ?
because amanda was like a sister to me .
and what the graysons did to her and her father makes me sick .
the real the question is , why are you married to daniel ?
what &apos;s your stake in this ?
like amanda ...
maybe you ...
i think david clarke was innocent .
did you ever do anything about it ?
i tried .
i even met with him once .
a few days later ,
i was pulled over and blew a 0.14 .
i never drove drunk . conrad had set me up .
and a d.u.i. is grounds for disbarment .
and if he was willing to go that far ,
at least you know you were onto something .
you &apos;re looking for answers , too , aren &apos;t you ?
for amanda .
maybe i can help .
thanks , stevie , but ...
after everything that &apos;s happened ,
it &apos;s important for me to put jack &apos;s feelings first .
i know he wants to let this go .
javier ?
somebody didn &apos;t forget what i taught him inside .
what the hell are you doing ?
i was looking for a bottle opener .
please tell me you did not hack your way out of prison .
no , man . i &apos;m out . on the up @-@ and @-@ up .
and breaking the law already .
you have some serious security breaches ,
which i can help you with .
you said i could crash here .
i @-@ if you had nowhere else to st--
you have nowhere else to stay .
but what about your mom ?
you &apos;d think she &apos;d appreciate that i used the money i stole
from the n.s.a. to put her through night school ,
but she just can &apos;t seem to get over the first part
or the &quot; getting caught &quot; part .
well , you were kind of an idiot .
i mean , signing your hacks with an anagram of your name ?
which you told me , like , every day .
yeah , because you had a lot to learn ,
and i had a lot of time to teach you .
how about you let me put it to good use , huh ?
come on . what do you got in the hopper these days ?
i bet it is something huge .
all right , you know what ?
don &apos;t worry about what i &apos;m working on .
just ... focus on finding yourself a place to stay .
for now ... i can crash ?
for one day . one day only .
i had to meet the man
who took snapshots of the wiliest person i know .
you &apos;re good .
thank you , mrs. grayson .
but your son said i &apos;d satisfied his need for my services .
well , i have a new angle i &apos;m working on ,
and i think you &apos;re just the person to help me out .
excuse me , mrs. grayson , but your dress has arrived .
already ?
oh . would you excuse me ?
i had an inspiration for what you could wear to the opera .
well , i applaud your presumption .
i &apos;ve already picked out a gown .
not like this one .
i had it overnighted by the designers .
you &apos;re friends with dolce &amp; gabbana ?
i have many friends .
well , i recently had dinner with domenico .
your name didn &apos;t come up .
oh , really ?
well , i &apos;m trying not to give people reasons to talk about me .
which is a big difference from the man i met years ago .
i have changed .
so have you . divorce suits you .
your charms won &apos;t work on me , pascal .
not this time .
perhaps we should go , then .
oh , maybe i should try on that gown .
the designers are friends of mine , after all .
i wouldn &apos;t want to offend .
and it &apos;s stunning .
i look forward to seeing you at &quot; pagliacci . &quot;
saw emily last night .
did she call you ?
i went to her .
what &apos;s going on there ?
nothing .
she sent me away out of loyalty to you .
we &apos;ve been through a lot .
and the lawyer in me says you both want to do right by amanda ,
so why discourage that ?
i know it &apos;s selfish , but ...
i don &apos;t want another thing taken from me .
this is worth fighting for .
i don &apos;t know that it is .
an innocent man was put behind bars .
if there &apos;s anything that can be done , i want to help .
it &apos;s that important to you ?
cases like david clarke &apos;s were the reason i became a lawyer .
i wanted to be in the trenches , fighting for the underdog ,
which is what i do every day in my divorce practice .
for me , it &apos;s all about justice .
and how were you gonna get that for david clarke ?
after he was convicted , i looked into his case ,
and i received a suspicious piece of evidence ,
but i couldn &apos;t verify the source .
once i was disbarred , my firm confiscated everything .
and with that ... went all hope .
now there &apos;s no way to get that information .
push the 36th floor .
jack , you sure you &apos;re up for this ?
well , if you could have just hacked the files , then --
well , if you &apos;d wanted something from this century , no problem ,
but everything else is on hard drives
that aren &apos;t connected to anything else .
so , therefore , you have to physically break into their archives .
and this thing &apos;s rigged to open the security door ?
hmm . it will be .
look , once you &apos;re in ,
you &apos;re gonna locate the june 1997 hard --
grab it and get out of there . i know . yeah .
i will meet you after my meeting .
ms. stevie &apos;s old firm is fairly high @-@ profile ,
and i need new lawyers
if i &apos;m gonna flood the market with new product .
jack , i can &apos;t keep depriving the world of my genius .
yeah , about that , do you want me to stop the elevator ?
i just have to get through the security firewall
through the network , and then we should be good to go .
almost there .
oh , jack of little faith .
this just came for you .
thank you .
nolan ross .
i have a meeting with the head of the patent department .
yes , mr. ross . one second , please .
nolan ross is here to see you , sir .
please have a seat . he &apos;ll be right with you .
thanks .
june &apos; 97 .
june &apos; 97 .
there ain &apos;t no dates .
look , i work fast , so i want a team that can secure patents
as quickly as i &apos;m going to need them .
all due respect , mr. ross , seems of late ,
your legal needs are more the &quot; keep me off death row &quot; kind .
well , last year was fraught with unforeseeable obstacles ,
but i am ready to chart a new course .
well , if that &apos;s the case , we may be interested in your comeback .
don &apos;t call it a comeback .
i &apos;ve been here for years .
我不知道该拿哪个
excuse me .
our time is money , mr. ross .
and i can afford it .
nolan !
nope . you got upgraded to javier .
do you know what year the firm was founded ?
i &apos;m sorry . who is this ?
do you want their info or mine ?
what year , and what &apos;s the first number on the drives ?
all right . uh ...
uh , uh , 1978 , and , um , e23754 .
are you sure that &apos;s not &quot; 56 &quot; ?
you &apos;re right . it &apos;s 56 .
thought so .
it &apos;s a basic rolling @-@ code crypto .
i saw tats in prison that were harder to figure out than that .
oh , right . of course .
you &apos;re nolan &apos;s friend from prison .
okay , you want june &apos; 97 .
it &apos;s gonna be l39935 , l39936 .
and grab l39937 in case you read wrong again .
and i just broke my probation on landline ,
which is gonna be traced in 5 , 4 , 3 -- later .
l39935 .
you &apos;re still here .
i thought without a future as a partner ,
you would lose interest in voulez .
i was curious as to how , in this new @-@ media era ,
a magazine could start out so successfully ,
so i had a forensic accountant look into the books ,
and i @-@ i think i may have underestimated you , pascal .
you also underestimate the power of the lemarchal name .
he &apos;s right .
now get out .
that &apos;s my girl .
no , i &apos;m talking to you , pascal .
this is my magazine . its success is because of me .
but your presence here is not only unneeded ,
it &apos;s unwanted .
see ? that &apos;s what happens when you have kids too young .
you don &apos;t raise them properly .
oh , well , that may be so ,
but allow me to applaud your success at raising the bottom line .
it appears , margaux , that voulez is losing money
to the tune of a million every quarter .
our ledgers show we &apos;re in the black , conrad .
no , that &apos;s true .
but when they cross the pond to pascal &apos;s accountants ,
the numbers change .
that &apos;s a savvy move , pascal -- indulging your daughter
while creating a handsome quarterly write @-@ off .
what ? is this true ?
this is why i said business wasn &apos;t for you , sweetheart .
you &apos;re an evil man .
now this from a woman who fired my son to save her company ,
whom you &apos;re more than welcome to reinstate once i &apos;ve moved
into the lemarchal manhattan headquarters .
that &apos;s assuming we now see eye @-@ to @-@ eye , pascal .
are you sure you want to go down that road ?
&apos;cause it goes back 20 years .
it was important to stevie that you have them .
why did you do this ?
because your father was important to me , too .
i don &apos;t want you involved , jack .
emily , your dad was a good man , an innocent man .
and isn &apos;t that what this is all about ?
the fight for justice ?
this is my fight , not yours .
would you just let me help ?
no !
look , you were right .
we &apos;re finally getting back to a good place .
i honored what you asked me before --
i left your mother alone .
i need you to do the same .
just stay out of it . please .
what are you doing ?
i retained your p.i. ,
who discovered that aiden &apos;s in bermuda ,
which is good because it means he poses no imminent threat .
hold on a second , y @-@ you &apos;re using my detective ?
since when ?
since emily rejected that huge settlement .
i was testing her , daniel .
grifters have their price , and emily couldn &apos;t be bought .
she &apos;s targeting our family and not our fortune .
the best way to expose what she &apos;s after
is to keep her here with you .
absolutely not . i &apos;m getting that divorce .
don &apos;t you find it odd that she happened to date aiden mathis ,
whose father planted the bomb on flight 197
and that she was close with amanda clarke ,
whose childhood home she was living in .
there &apos;s a connection .
i &apos;m going to find out what her plan is .
to what end ?
your theories could take months or even years to prove .
now , right now the only plan that i &apos;m concerned about
is getting her the hell out of my life .
what were you thinking ?
i should have told you jack approached me .
well , it can &apos;t happen again , nolan .
we &apos;ve talked about this . what the --
where the hell did you even get this stuff ?
javier . uh , he decoded the labels .
javier ?
he &apos;s this millennial computer genius from prison that i --
are you kidding me ?
he got out . he landed on my doorstep .
i don &apos;t know . he looks up to me .
lord knows why .
i know i &apos;ve been a little dormant lately ,
but ... i &apos;ve still got a lot of ideas .
you don &apos;t have to prove yourself to me , nolan .
i just hope you didn &apos;t tell javier too much .
oh , don &apos;t worry .
he had no idea what we were stealing or why .
good .
hey , look at this .
that &apos;s a bombshell .
but who made the bomb ?
my next target .
hmm , why don &apos;t you practice for the spotlight
&apos;cause it &apos;s gonna keep getting hotter .
charlotte , i haven &apos;t seen you in forever .
i cover voulez &apos; gossip line now , so busy , busy .
but that doesn &apos;t mean we can &apos;t catch up over lunch .
oh , i &apos;d love that .
see what i mean ?
pascal lemarchal just arrived .
i &apos;ll introduce you .
pascal .
hi , charlotte . how are you ?
have you met my sister @-@ in @-@ law , emily grayson ?
hi . nice to meet you .
really , yeah .
excuse me .
i knew you couldn &apos;t resist .
well , fine art &apos;s meant to be displayed .
and appreciated .
keep your distance , pascal .
this dress may touch my body , but you &apos;ll never be so lucky .
you look handsome , mr. porter .
it &apos;s a pleasure , ms. grayson .
&quot; stevie , &quot; please .
it &apos;s so nice to meet the woman who &apos;s making my son so happy .
if you &apos;ll both excuse me .
sure .
ah . you must be jack .
mr. lemarchal , it &apos;s so nice to meet you .
i always enjoy meeting a fellow self @-@ made man .
i &apos;m in town for a few more days .
hope we can spend some time together .
i would like that very much .
should we , uh -- should we find our seats ?
um , i &apos;ll just be a moment .
all right . nice to meet you .
take care .
yes ?
i thought you were leaving tomorrow .
oh , i might stay a little bit longer
to handle some unfinished business .
and maybe teach you a thing or two , sweetheart .
excuse me .
i &apos;ll fill you in on everything later ,
but it &apos;s time to show our fathers what we &apos;re capable of .
care to join me ?
i &apos;m certainly in a fighting mood .
mom .
you are not gonna believe this .
this just came across the voulez tip line .
it can &apos;t be true , can it ?
how could you ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
faking a pregnancy to force daniel into marriage .
what kind of lunatic are you ? !
you want to do this now ?
your medical records are out there .
now everyone knows .
those are private .
so it &apos;s true ?
where are you going , emily ? !
you can run emily , but this will follow you .
your dirty , little secret is out .
you &apos;re nothing but a fraud and a liar
who deceived my son into marriage !
emily thorne , you are done here .
after everything i &apos;ve done to protect you , daniel .
this is over .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing .
emily , dear , it &apos;s time to leave .
don &apos;t touch me !
the divorce papers ,
i had them redrafted ,
so i don &apos;t think that settlement amount is still in there .
you &apos;ll be leaving with nothing .
well , i still have the fact that daniel shot me .
you called a press conference , got up on that balcony ,
and told the world that lydia shot you .
so , which story is it ? hmm ?
after last night , no one &apos;s going to believe you .
you &apos;ll look like a resentful woman
caught in a lie about a pregnancy that never existed .
then i guess you both got what you wanted .
oh , i just love the opera .
you never know what performance you &apos;re going to get .
did you leak the medical records ?
no . the timing was curious .
i love you , daniel .
and i simply saw an opportunity to help you , and i took it ,
but i &apos;m still keeping my eye on ms. thorne .
if she sticks around , your theory &apos;s correct .
she &apos;s targeting us .
and i will find out why .
if you get sauce on my couch ,
you &apos;re buying me a new one , and , uh , i meant what i said .
you can stay for one day , which is over now .
is that any way to treat your tech support ?
and besides , i can &apos;t legally leave anyways .
i , uh ...
i sort of gave my parole officer your address .
you put yourself under house arrest at my house ?
i just want to live alone . is that too much to ask ?
is this a ... is this a picture of me ?
yeah , i &apos;m , uh ...
i &apos;m thinking about becoming an artiste .
not according to these scribbles , but ...
wait . what is the rest of this , really ?
it &apos;s an idea for a web aggregator .
think of it as antisocial media .
i just ... can &apos;t crack it .
that &apos;s &apos; cause you &apos;re using c + + .
i could fix this in a nanosecond with binary .
do you see ? that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
and , seriously , thanks for letting me stay , man .
you &apos;re the only guy i liked inside ,
so i &apos;m in your debt .
well , based on , uh , what i &apos;m seeing here ...
you might be able to repay me .
the one time i miss the opera ,
something interesting actually happens .
it was extraordinary .
i feel pretty bad for your daughter @-@ in @-@ law .
oh , i &apos;m sure by now , she &apos;s my ex @-@ daughter @-@ in @-@ law .
i was on my way out .
please ... feel free to drink on my tab .
now , pascal , come on .
you and i both know you &apos;re gonna give me what i want .
conrad , i understand you don &apos;t hear &quot; no &quot; very often ,
but i have no intention of merging our companies .
ever .
well , what if i got you the one thing you &apos;ve always wanted
but never had ?
i have everything a man could want .
except victoria .
hey .
hey .
i just wanted to make sure you were okay .
press is saying some pretty harsh stuff .
no , i &apos;m fine . everything went as expected .
of course . you were behind it .
look , as much as i hated using charlotte ,
i had to create a public break from the graysons ,
and i needed them to feel like they won .
which you would only do if you had a new plan .
tell me what &apos;s going on .
you know how dangerous this is ,
and i don &apos;t want you getting hurt again .
i &apos;m not sitting on the sidelines anymore , emily .
what you are doing ,
it &apos;s not just about justice for your father .
it &apos;s also for declan ...
and amanda .
yes , and i will get it for them .
i got you that information yesterday ,
which means i &apos;m now involved , and so is my mother .
so you can either make this a fight ,
or you can get good with it now .
what was on those drives ?
&quot; conrad , per you request ,
i handled twm .
your dc plan is safe . &quot;
i assume &quot; dc &quot; is your dad ,
but what &apos;s , what &apos;s &quot; twm &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know , but i &apos;m gonna figure it out .
how ?
my mom said she never knew who wrote the letter .
i think i do .
look at this .
there &apos;s a shadow on the edge of the note where it was scanned ,
which means it wasn &apos;t standard american measurements .
it was european .
and this is a note i received
when i agreed to let &quot; voulez &quot; cover my wedding .
it &apos;s the same handwriting .
pascal is a part of this ?
yeah , i think he is .
and i know you love his daughter ,
which is why i don &apos;t want you involved in this .
then we have to take the risk ...
and hope that there &apos;s no collateral damage .
i &apos;ll make sure there won &apos;t be .
pascal won &apos;t even know he was hit .
