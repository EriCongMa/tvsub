here &apos;s your check .
sorry about the entire experience .
you &apos;re gonna have to take it the rest of the way .
i slept funny last year .
you know , i happen to be a massage therapist ,
and i happen to be broke , so what do you say
i get that crick out of your neck as your tip ?
i miss being able to just say no .
hold on , i have to run this by a person who &apos;s been poor longer .
sadly , that guy over there is offering me a massage as a tip .
sadly @-@ er , i &apos;m considering it .
sadly @-@ est , you were here when that old woman punched me
in the breast and then asked for change , right ?
we &apos;re not doing great .
there &apos;s got to be somebody doing worse than you two .
like that guy who got left on mars last year .
question , girls .
i &apos;m making a healthier menu .
should i advertise no trans fat ,
or does that sound like i &apos;m trying to keep out chaz bono ?
而查兹 · 波诺就是个胖变性人
not now , han , i have a massage scheduled .
all the stress of acting like you &apos;re working
starting to get to you ?
i just had what she &apos;s having .
max , are you busy right now ?
no , i &apos;m at work .
cool .
i &apos;m gonna call a staff meeting .
i used to call my driver to
pick up sushi during gilmore girls ,
but now i call staff meetings at a diner .
only i can call staff meetings at the diner .
it &apos;s one of the perks of the job .
well , it &apos;s the perk of the job .
well , it &apos;s okay .
the staff meeting is about the dessert bar
max and i are opening in our cupcake window .
if you want , han , you can call the meeting ,
but i can &apos;t imagine you &apos;d be petty enough
to take the thrill away from caroline .
staff meeting !
see , this is what happens
when the mother cat refuses to lick the runt .
okay , so i &apos;m checking on the dessert bar assignments
i gave everyone .
earl , did you call your cousin
at that liquor distributor about getting us a discount ?
now , why would i call him ?
i owe him $ 10,000 and a kidney .
so that &apos;s a &quot; not yet . &quot;
i haven &apos;t done my thing , either .
caroline , with all your money from hollywood ,
you could pay other people to do this stuff ...
and also replace the transmission on a 2012 yaris .
we have to save all our movie money for the dessert bar .
believe it or not , my boobs can &apos;t get us zoning permits .
but they did get us kicked out of an architect &apos;s office .
oleg , did you talk to your connection at city hall
about expediting our liquor license ?
yes , she told me , &quot; don &apos;t ever sneak into my home
through the bathroom window again . &quot;
oh , this is rich .
now you two see some of the hell i go through
as a small business owner .
no , you go through hell &apos; cause nobody wants to
see your small business .
staff meeting over !
small staff meeting .
max , your boyfriend is a lawyer .
when you &apos;re at his hotel tonight ,
can you ask him to look at our liquor license ?
also , could you fill an ice bucket with mini shampoos
and bring it home ?
no on both counts .
you &apos;re not using randy for legal advice .
and as for the shampoo , they switched to a pump bolted to the wall ,
&apos;cause i was getting greedy .
hey , randy .
hey , earl .
saw your rant on twitter last night .
and i agree ;
what self @-@ respecting sizzler runs out of sprite ?
i put that on twitter ?
i thought i was writing an email to my brother .
hey there , beautiful .
so i thought we &apos;d try something different tonight .
you on top ?
no , i &apos;m not talking about changing our whole power dynamic .
i &apos;m talking about staying at your apartment .
so , you on bottom ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s where i live .
no , really .
we &apos;re living in a fantasy world , that hotel room .
i mean , a really sexy fantasy world ,
with people cleaning up after us
and a maid who knew you from high school .
boy , was she surprised to see me naked and alive .
i know i always am .
and max , i &apos;ve been to your apartment .
it wasn &apos;t that bad .
uh , okay , fine . we can stay at my place .
but it &apos;s byoc .
bring your own carbon monoxide detector .
well , here we are .
slum , sweet slum .
she says that every time she walks in here .
it &apos;s usually to scare the crack addict out of our kitchen .
allen , are you here ?
all right , well , this is it .
what do you want to do now ?
we usually go to sleep so death comes sooner .
you guys , i can handle an apartment .
don &apos;t let my broad shoulders , stubble , and adam &apos;s apple confuse you ;
i am , in fact , a man .
coming up straight ahead is the kitchen .
but i don &apos;t have to tell you that .
you can smell the gas .
fun fact : those paper towels you see aren &apos;t actually paper ,
but they do cause cancer .
ooh , let me guess : the grim reaper ?
no , the grim reaper comes on tuesdays and thursdays .
hey , girls .
and randy . oh .
someone &apos;s been taking his handsome pills .
well , they make them in chewable now .
makes it a lot easier .
oh , randy &apos;s here ?
hey , hey , hey , bro .
we should hang upstairs later .
we can eat pizza and watch dirty movies .
it &apos;s not delivery ; it &apos;s diporno .
that &apos;s a hard no .
girls , we need to store some stuff in your place .
oleg and i are baby @-@ proofing our apartment .
my mom baby @-@ proofed our house for me .
she put a club on the steering wheel .
so in this duffle bag , i have--
he &apos;s opening it !
randy , close your eyes !
relax .
it &apos;s just swords
and sex toys .
oh , i think one of them &apos;s both .
are you referring to sex @-@ calibur ?
oh , i love this one .
this is the sword we used
when we were playing bonan the barbarian .
and you know what ?
it &apos;s good to give to the less sexually fortunate .
yeah .
the sex toys are for you , caroline .
i &apos;m good , i had a massage .
what are you doing ?
this is how all the great ninjas eat their bagels .
where &apos;s randy ?
did he go back to the land of not @-@ expired milk ,
and not @-@ expired honey ?
no , he &apos;s stronger than i thought .
much like that little person i arm wrestled at chelsea piers .
i love it here .
i just took the grayest shower of my life .
did you just say &quot; grayest &quot; or &quot; greatest &quot; ?
no , i said gray .
i was being kind .
it was brown .
all right , well , come on , your sword bagel is ready .
god , i do miss having sex .
also , what is the deal with--
oh ! god ! oh !
ugh , i just stepped on something painful .
really painful !
is there a nail sticking up through the floor ?
oh no , he stepped on nail patrick harris !
已入行多年
oh , i forgot to warn you about that stupid nail .
it &apos;s been there forever . i just know to avoid it by now .
everyone does ; that &apos;s why we named it
&quot; nail patrick harris . &quot;
are you okay ?
you look like you &apos;re in a lot of pain .
do you want to roll the dice
with one of the pills in the couch ?
i &apos;m fine . it &apos;s not that bad .
okay , well lift up your foot . let me see .
oh , my god , oh , my god , oh , my god !
randy ?
this is bad .
i think we have to take you to hapitalito .
well , i must be losing consciousness .
that sounded like gibberish .
no , you heard me right , i said hapitalito .
that &apos;s our healthcare provider .
it &apos;s a guy with a shopping cart filled with band @-@ aids ,
and most of them aren &apos;t used .
max , i have insurance .
well , i don &apos;t think he takes insurance ,
but if you have old tcby cards ,
five is good for &quot; uno surgeria . &quot;
well , maybe it stopped .
i &apos;m carrie ! i &apos;m carrie at the prom !
杀人魔女主角在舞会上被人泼了一桶猪血
caroline , come on , we have to go .
i &apos;m already covered in blood . just leave me to die .
oh , calm down !
if this had happened with any of my regular type of guys ,
you &apos;d be halfway to hep c right now .
help ! help !
my apartment tried to kill my boyfriend !
he &apos;s gonna die !
i &apos;m not gonna die , max .
although , this cvs bag you tied around my foot
has completely cut off the circulation .
and the ten @-@ foot receipt &apos;s caught in the wound .
my boyfriend needs medical attention .
oh , really ?
i thought he was here for a sensible pantsuit
at a reasonable price .
oh , i recognize you
from the last time we were in here .
i wasn &apos;t attracted to you then ,
but i see you &apos;ve added balding and a beard to the mix .
ha , ha , i remember you too .
the devil wears target .
we need a good doctor ,
so he better not be from america .
&apos;cause he has insurance .
show him the card , randy .
could i touch it ?
oh , good for you , a ppo .
you know , i cleaned up some ppo right there .
come on , this is serious !
he might have &quot; tetris &quot; !
he &apos;s got the beloved russian puzzle game ?
are you sure he doesn &apos;t have a case of the
super mario brothers ?
well , there &apos;s a lot of people ahead of you ,
so why don &apos;t you take your boyfriend &apos;s boo boo
and sit down ?
fine .
but he better not die , &apos; cause if he does ,
i &apos;m gonna take those buttons
and pin them to your sack .
promise ?
damn it !
i guess we &apos;re gonna be here forever .
the exact amount of time caroline &apos;s shower took .
oh , so it &apos;s my fault your boyfriend
freddy krueger @-@ ed all over me ?
caroline , i am so sorry .
that &apos;s okay , randy .
you can make it up to me .
right now !
i just so happen to have our liquor license application ,
if you want to take a look @-@ see .
do you also want to be pinned to that albino &apos;s sack , caroline ?
okay , coming through .
okay , let me clear a path .
now i know how my grandma dorothy felt .
oh , good , you &apos;re back .
randy , are you okay ?
oh , i &apos;m fine .
did some shopping after you left the er .
like my new bag ?
if you need a clutch to match ,
i have something similar in ziploc .
because the nail was rusted
and the open wound touched our floor ,
they gave randy an iv of antibiotics .
and not even a whisper of vicodin for old maxie .
well , max , one of us has to go to work
and pretend both of us are there .
well , it &apos;s gonna have to be you .
i can &apos;t leave randy here .
it &apos;s like a haunted house , but the dangers are real .
max , you &apos;re going to work .
i &apos;ll be fine here .
i had a time @-@ share with sean penn .
媒体曾爆出麦当娜因遭其家暴而离婚
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
it &apos;s my fault you got nailed in my apartment ,
and i &apos;m staying here to protect you .
you &apos;re going to work .
i &apos;ll be okay .
but you &apos;re very cute when you &apos;re worried .
like when you thought the hotel didn &apos;t get cartoon network .
all right , fine .
but call me if you need me to come back .
i &apos;ll tell han i &apos;m working the rest of my shift from home .
oh , my god !
i just remembered i didn &apos;t tell randy
about the pothole in my bedroom .
max , relax .
i haven &apos;t seen you this anxious
since the dominos pizza tracker went down .
look , woman !
randy came to new york to see if our relationship could work ,
but we never should have left that hotel .
it &apos;s like when you go to vegas and wander off the strip
and wind up in a residential neighborhood .
you can &apos;t come back from that .
it &apos;s how i wound up living two years in someone &apos;s shed .
i suppose the motivational newsletter
i sent out this morning didn &apos;t do any good .
i don &apos;t even know why i bother publishing
what &apos;s going han ?
i like the comic strip about the fat squirrel .
that picture was me !
it can &apos;t be you ; he had nuts .
and that lady at table four ordered
before she started knitting that sweater she &apos;s now wearing .
oh , good , it &apos;s randy .
hey , i forgot to tell you ,
you can &apos;t drink the tap water within five minutes
after flushing the toilet .
well , can you make yourself throw up ?
pickup : breakfast burrito .
randy called our landlord
to complain about nail patrick harris !
i &apos;d rather see him host something than ricky gervais .
we get it : you &apos;re mean , you fat bastard .
randy called the landlord ?
but we &apos;re illegal subletters !
we &apos;re squatters there !
and over most toilets .
come on , caroline , we have to get to the apartment
before the landlord does .
you &apos;re leaving ?
the tollbooth operator who won powerball
stayed at their job longer .
randy , we got to go !
i &apos;ll start packing ! you saddle up chestnut .
yeah , i know the drill : one pair of shoes ,
something you can carry on your back ,
and a sun hat for guatemala--
i mean , wherever we &apos;re headed .
randy , you better drink up the rest of the that iv fluid ,
&apos;cause carrying that around is just gonna slow us down .
max , what in the hell is going on ?
why are you freaking out ?
i called the landlord about a nail ,
not the fbi about your passport ...
frank delaport .
randy , we &apos;re not on the lease to this apartment .
okay , i &apos;m ready .
i just need ten minutes to saddle up chestnut .
it &apos;ll give me time to practice my accent .
we &apos;re totally screwed now .
thanks a lot .
this is why we should have stayed in the hotel .
you could have screwed me there and i would have loved it .
max , i just didn &apos;t want you
to live with a nail sticking out of your floor ,
and i knew you wouldn &apos;t fix it yourself .
what is that supposed to mean ?
it &apos;s like you don &apos;t realize
you don &apos;t have to live like this .
oh , great .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m in a relationship
with my high school guidance counselor .
again .
you know , your life can be a whole lot better
than you think it can be .
why don &apos;t you just hammer the nail in ?
because we are used to it .
we just ignore it , like the rain in my bedroom .
i knew my apartment would be too real for you ,
and now it &apos;s not even gonna be my apartment .
all right , max .
i put the double saddle on chestnut ,
filled the satchel with trail mix .
that should get us to the george washington bridge .
nobody has to go anywhere .
not even your friend , the giant pinata .
里面装满糖果玩具 在派对上让人打爆取乐
let me deal with this .
but ...
we &apos;ve never met this guy !
all we know about him
is that even the guy in 2a is afraid of him ,
and he was married to kirstie alley .
她旗下的减肥产品也曾因不实广告而被起诉
i can handle myself .
hand me my fluids .
that sounded not manly .
hey , sport , thanks for coming .
he can &apos;t talk his way out of this .
he &apos;s wasting his time .
he might as well be trying to teach shapes to kendall jenner .
智商见仁见智
no , no , you listen !
well , randy &apos;s dead .
no matter how many boyfriends i bury ,
it &apos;s never easy .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re getting kicked out like this .
in my fantasy , i bought the building
and opened a sadness museum .
okay , that &apos;s it .
took care of the landlord .
you killed him ?
i &apos;ll call oleg ; we &apos;ll get his friend &apos;s truck
and take it from here .
okay , first , i believe that you have
and would cover up a murder .
but nobody &apos;s dead .
i just explained to him the situation ,
and you &apos;re not getting kicked out .
all right , which one of us has to marry him ?
i &apos;ll go get my wedding sweatpants .
i just explained to him that i &apos;m a lawyer
who sustained an injury on his property .
then i mentioned the faulty wiring , the gas leak ,
the various wildlife living here ,
and , oh-- that i &apos;m a lawyer .
the word &quot; lawyer &quot; makes people crap their pants .
it &apos;s like the juice cleanse of professions .
and that is why you get the next two months rent @-@ free ,
and you are now officially on the lease .
we &apos;re on the lease ?
we &apos;re legit ?
i have never been legit .
according to my birth certificate ,
i &apos;m actually a cabbage patch doll .
thank you so much , randy .
i &apos;m gonna go tell chestnut the good news .
chestnut !
how about that ?
your new name doesn &apos;t have to be pablo .
thank you .
i don &apos;t know what she would have done .
she is not made for the streets .
she &apos;s not even made for polyester .
this is awkward .
just trying to get a horse out of a tiny doorway .
all right , up .
i have to get back to the hotel .
have you seen my protective bootie ?
wait , why are you taking your booties back to the hotel ?
well , you &apos;re obviously not comfortable with me being here .
no one &apos;s comfortable being here .
it &apos;s here .
look , max .
i wanted to stay here
because i wanted to see how you live .
now i know you live on an indian food burial ground .
you know what ? you &apos;re right .
my life can be better .
we don &apos;t have hammer money yet , so ...
you know what time it is ?
it &apos;s hammer time !
well , that &apos;s the end of nail patrick harris .
are you kidding ?
with charisma like that , he &apos;s not going anywhere .
i think we just got through our first fight .
and only one of us had to go to the hospital ,
so i think that &apos;s pretty good .
i think that is pretty good .
you know what else i think ?
i love you .
i love you too .
that is so sweet .
i &apos;ll give you two some privacy .
i &apos;ll be in my room .
caroline ...
even as a mime , you &apos;re still hot .
while you were at work , i filled out your application
for the liquor license .
randy , i love you too .
sorry , the walls are thin , and i was listening .
hey , girls .
and randy . oh ...
i &apos;m gonna need my duffle bag back .
i hate to be an uzbeki @-@ giver ,
but i really miss my vibrating pearl .
are these supposed to be doing other things ?
oh , no , does this mean you want your swords back ?
&apos;cause i was gonna butter some toast later .
i &apos;m sorry , caroline .
we really missed our sex toys .
it &apos;s not as exciting when i just put double @-@ a batteries in oleg .
that &apos;s weird .
sophie &apos;s the one with sex toys , i &apos;m the one with the boyfriend ,
and caroline &apos;s the one who &apos;s wet .
