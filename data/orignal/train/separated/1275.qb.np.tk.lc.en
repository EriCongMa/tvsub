come on , guys . give him a break .
he just wanted to see the baby .
really ? well , i don &apos;t see the baby .

i know i should have called ,
but , uh , i wanted to surprise you kids .
great . we love your surprises .
&quot; surprise !
&quot; i &apos;m leaving your mother !
&quot; surprise !
i slept with tommy &apos;s girlfriend ! &quot;
&quot; surprise !
&quot; i left all you guys holding the bag
when i stiffed the i.r.s. to the tune of 27,000 bucks ! &quot;
all right , all right , you know ,

what pe-- that &apos;s maura !
i &apos;m gonna go make some tea . excuse me .

i &apos;ll talk to you when you &apos;re not with him .
then you won &apos;t be talking .
how you doing , frank ?
how am i doing ? better before i saw you .
and what are you doing with my wife ?
ex @-@ wife , frank .
and unless you &apos;re here to explain
why you left me holding the bag with the i.r.s. ,
i want you to leave !
pop , w @-@ why don &apos;t you just leave , okay ?
where are you staying at ?
i @-@ i &apos;m staying at the , uh , lighthouse motel .
okay , so , you know , w @-@ we &apos;ll talk tomorrow .
&quot; we &quot; ? speak for yourself .
good night , frank .
kids , come inside for a cup of tea .
i &apos;ll see you later , pop .
yeah .
i @-@ i @-@ i got to go to work , okay ?
y @-@ you work too hard , jane .
can you just go to the motel , please ?
he has yet to apologize for taking off to florida
and hooking up with a bunch of bimbos .
well , apologizing is a major threat to identity and self @-@ esteem
if you &apos;re someone who struggles to manage strong emotions .
body &apos;s in the bathroom .
could be a robbery gone bad .
no sign of a wallet or cellphone .
no i.d. ?
no .
who found her ?
manager .
people have been complaining for a while
that the john was out of order .
so whoever killed her had time to get out of here .
did you find the weapon ?
no . but we got people looking for it .
okay . is this the victim &apos;s guitar ?
i think so .
we &apos;re gonna dust the guitar and the case for prints .
hey , frost , give me a bag , would you ?
look at this .
looks like a piece of that stuff they put in gift baskets .
definitely a guitar player .
she has calluses on her left fingertips .
look at the velour .
it &apos;s indented , like something hard was hidden in the case .
well , if she brought a guitar ,
she was planning on playing .
did you see the lineup ?
yeah , it &apos;s camp fire night at the argot .
a bunch of female singer @-@ songwriters .
but she doesn &apos;t look like anyone on it .
they have an open mike from 10 : 00 to 10 : 30 .
penetration wound to the posterior between the fifth intercostal rib
and scapula and anterior
between the fourth and fifth ribs in the cardiac notch .
can you tell the murder weapon we &apos;re looking for ?
not until autopsy .
that &apos;ll be after i get some sleep .
let &apos;s get her to the morgue .
sleep deprivation is as much of an impairment as inebriation .
i do not like to make mistakes .
can you give me a hint ?
oh , do i have to ?
what , do you want this conversation to end and go to bed ?
well , you are looking for something with a sharp tip ,
although the wound is not incised laterally .
so , a knife with a pointy tip and dull sides .
i didn &apos;t say a knife .
we &apos;re looking for an spt .
sharp pointy thing .
i am comfortable with that , yes .
everybody in here has a smartphone .
i &apos;ll call frankie ,
get him to look at what &apos;s been posted on instagram ,
vine , twitter , snapchat .
stop , you &apos;re making me feel old .
you are old .
okay . i guess we &apos;re done here .
what are you doing here ?
i needed to speak to you .
have you started drinking again ?
yeah . i needed my old friend .
what is it , the back @-@ taxes thing ?
what ?
i got cancer .
when did you find out ?
a few weeks ago .
it &apos;s prostate .
how bad ?
they don &apos;t know yet .
they sent me here for a second opinion at mass general .
i &apos;m sorry , pop .
jane , i just want--
do you have any idea what you did to us ,
what you did to ma ?
i ... look , it &apos;s hard for me to open up .
well , try .
you put your family through hell ,
and i for one would like to know why .
you were a good dad .
we were a @-@ a good family . we had good times , right ?
yes , we did .
so , why -- why would you sleep with lydia ?
why would you do that to ma and then just take off like that ?
look , i loved your mother for a long time .
and when you kids were home and the business was good ,
we were happy .
but then you guys grew up and left .
business went bad , and there was just me and her .
i was just so unhappy , janie .
so you &apos;re only back because you need us .
i was hoping that you need me , too .
look , jane ,
would you tell your mother about the cancer ?
i need her , too .
and i know if it comes from you , she won &apos;t turn me down .
pop , i can &apos;t .
i &apos;ll be here for you , okay ?
but ... you got to ask her for forgiveness
before you can ask her for help .
oh , jane . come on in .
can i get you some tea ?
uh , no , thanks .
why did he tell me ?
why do i always have to be the oldest ?
prostate cancer is one of the most survivable cancers
if it doesn &apos;t spread .
do you know what stage it &apos;s in ?
he didn &apos;t know .
i had to stop him
when he started worrying about his manhood .
well , the good news is that 40 % to 60 % of men
who were able to have erections before surgery
are able to after .
please , spare me that good news .
are there any visible symptoms of prostate cancer ?
you know , like a prostate limp or something ?
no , jane . why ?
it just ... i &apos;m not really sure i believe he has cancer .
why would he lie ?
i don &apos;t know -- to get sympathy , maybe .
that &apos;s why he came back ?
he &apos;s sick , isn &apos;t he ?
and he wanted you to tell me , didn &apos;t he ?
ma , he -- he told me
because he &apos;s afraid to tell you .
he should be .
what does he have ?
he has cancer , ma .
prostate cancer .
i see .
okay .
i &apos;ll deal with him .
and i &apos;ll tell your brothers .
you go home . you get some sleep , okay ?
i &apos;m sorry to dump this on you , ma .
you didn &apos;t , baby . you didn &apos;t . he did .
thanks , ma .
where are we on the case ?
we i.d. &apos; d the victim with her prints .
she was 21,
a student at the massachusetts music conservatory .
natasha osmanski .
why were her prints on file ?
she was booked on a d.u.i. charge six weeks ago .
it &apos;s still pending .
did you notify her parents ?
told them early this morning . it was rough .
they &apos;re coming in later . dad &apos;s apparently famous .
apparently ? it &apos;s alexi osmanski .
i know him . he was left wing for the bruins .
actually , he &apos;s a very famous composer and conductor .
all right , what about her stolen wallet ,
and has anybody used her credit cards ?
not yet . flagged them all .
anybody post any photos online of our victim ?
tons of postings , but i haven &apos;t seen any photos of her yet .
i &apos;ll keep checking .
she doesn &apos;t have a facebook page .
even i have a facebook page .
with three friends .
i &apos;ll be your friend .
you already are .
all right , maura &apos;s doing the autopsy .
uh , call me when the parents get here , okay ?
stomach contents -- smell them .
ooh . you know my policy .
unless that bile stew
can help me track her movements before she was stabbed ,
i do not sniff .
i just thought you would recognize vanilla .
what , she had a drink with vanilla in it ?
i don &apos;t know if it was a drink ,
but her blood @-@ alcohol level was 0.06 .
so that &apos;s one or two drinks for a girl her size .
what about her tox screen ?
clean for common prescription and street drugs .
okay , talk to me about the murder weapon .
still unclear , but i did check the , uh , toolmark database .
there are hundreds of possibilities --
knives , daggers ,
letter openers , nail clippers , and bayonets ,
stilettos .
stiletto shoes ?
yes , and stiletto blades .
maura , you were supposed to narrow it down
and not tell me
we &apos;still looking for a sharp pointy thing .
what &apos;s with the black stuff on the swab ?
oh , i found when i swabbed the posterior entry wound .
i was just about to give it to the crime lab .
you didn &apos;t sleep , did you ?
no , not much .
cavanaugh knows .
well , of course he does .
he and your mother are a couple .
i mean , it &apos;s not like
i want my parents to get back together , but ...
you don &apos;t think it &apos;s icky that my boss is ...
sleeping with my mother ?
no . but i @-@ i can see why you do .
you &apos;re never old enough to hear the details
of your mother &apos;s sex life .
ma just told tommy and frankie she needs moral support .
got a hit on the victim &apos;s credit card .
guy was using it right down the street at a 7 @-@ eleven .
they &apos;ve taken him to interrogation .
great . let &apos;s go talk to him .
uh , jane . what about your mother ?
i have an interrogation to do .
no .
no ?
you can &apos;t , jane .
go take care of your mother .
but he &apos;s a suspect , vince .
and frost and i can handle him .
where &apos;d you get that shiner ?
what shiner ?
i &apos;m guessing it happened
when you took natasha smanski &apos;s wallet .
who ?
more like , &quot; what ? &quot;
dumb move to leave it in your glove compartment , wayne .
no idea how it got there .
this isn &apos;t a picture of you using her credit card ?
it sure looks like you .
hey , man , she gave me that card .
oh , now she gave it to you .
was that right before you murdered her ?
you two be tripping .
we were talking . she was into me .
she gave me that card to buy us some drinks .
when i came back , she was gone .
we checked .
her card was not used at that bar .
so ...
are you ready to stop wasting our time here ?
okay , i took it .
all right ?
but that bitch was crazy .
before or after you stabbed her ?
i didn &apos;t stab her . i was just playing around .
but she started freaking out .
&quot; no one else is taking anything from me tonight ! &quot;
maybe because you took her wallet .
no , that was after she hauled off
and hit me with her guitar case , dude .
so you followed her to the ladies &apos; room ,
and you stabbed her .
no .
all right , the wallet was on the floor ,
so , yeah , i kept it .
a little payback for smashing my face .
i &apos;m the victim here .
take off your clothes , wayne .
oh , i don &apos;t swing that way , boys .
now you &quot; be tripping , &quot; dude .
we &apos;re looking for natasha &apos;s blood on your clothes .
strip .
i don &apos;t need to watch this .
i &apos;ve seen it before .
hey ! you can &apos;t do this !
oh , hey , sorry , forgot to mention .
you &apos;re under arrest --
for larceny and forgery .
now take off your clothes .
it &apos;s gonna be okay , right , jane ?
i don &apos;t know , tommy .
let &apos;s get all the information first , okay ?
yeah , you know , we can &apos;t control the cancer ,
so let &apos;s just help ma .
and if she wants to be there for him ,
whether he deserves it or not ,
then we be there for ma .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m taking your father
to his oncology appointment .
your mother &apos;s been a godsend .
that &apos;s too bad you just figured that out .
you &apos;re wrecking it . would you stop ?
will you stop , tommy ?
listen , i know i don &apos;t deserve your forgiveness .
all i &apos;m asking for is one last family dinner
before it &apos;s too late .
please .
okay , fine .
we &apos;ll do it at maura &apos;s tonight , okay ?
ma , you can &apos;t ask maura to do that .
let &apos;s do it at mario &apos;s . you know , just us family .
family ?
maura is family .
she took me in when i had no place to live
after you left me .
and you want our support ?
well , it has to be done my way with my family .
okay .
okay .
all right , let &apos;s go to the doctor .
call me when you &apos;re done , okay ?
yeah , listen , i was wondering .
can you just ... ?
damn it .
well , what &apos;s the matter ?
we can &apos;t tie the guy who took our victim &apos;s credit cards
to her murder , so we can only charge him with larceny .
i was wondering if you kids want to come
to the doctor with me .
yeah , pop . y @-@ yeah .
frankie and i got to get back to work , pop . sorry .
back to work .
okay . sure .
come on .
we should go with them .
yeah , we should .
i have results .
dr. isles , you seen jane ?
uh , she just texted me . she &apos;s looking for angela .
what happened with frank ?
i don &apos;t know .
she said to get started without her .
so , the black , gritty substance i found in the wound
was transferred from the weapon .
it &apos;s keratin hydrolysates , acetate nitrocellulose ,
and zinc sulfide .
i hear &quot; fingernails &quot; in there .
was the rest of it nail polish ?
black nail polish -- very good .
so the killer was a woman .
you might want to update the era you &apos;re living in .
guys wear nail polish now .
some guys .
so what &apos;s the weapon ? a nail file ?
possibly .
a steel eight @-@ inch nail file
is consistent with the wound tracks .
sounds like a crime of opportunity .
girl in a bar goes to the ladies &apos; room .
she &apos;s attacked and stabbed to death
with what could have been a nail file .
only real motive we have
is she had something in her guitar case the killer wanted .
i wish i could tell you what made that indentation .
all i know for sure was that it was a hard cylinder ,
roughly 10 inches tall with a 5 @-@ inch circumference .
could be a lot of things .
what about stomach contents ?
mostly bile ,
but we were able to identify althea officinalis .
marshmallow root .
that bar serve marshmallow root ?
they don &apos;t serve much .
no , i &apos;m not seeing anything with marshmallows in it .
so she was somewhere else before the bar .
you know , althea officinalis is also an herbal remedy
for gastrointestinal distress ,
colitis , and urinary @-@ tract infection .
did she have any of those ... issues ?
i have ordered her medical records .
and they are on their way .
you want to talk ?
is it bad , ma ?
it looks bad , honey .
victim &apos;s parents are here .
your daughter was adopted , then ?
yes .
there were so many unwanted babies in russia .
we fell in love with her .
we didn &apos;t know it would be so hard for her --
for us .
like many orphans ,
natasha had an attachment disorder .
by the time she was 3,
alexi realized she was a music prodigy .
one time she was on my lap ,
and i missed a chord .
and she says , &quot; you missed one , papa . &quot;
and she plays &quot; e &quot; major for me .
perfectly .
and she continued to play piano ?
uh , yes , yes .
she was , uh , awarded a scholarship .
at the massachusetts conservatory of music .
that &apos;s very prestigious .
when did she add guitar ?
guitar ?
she didn &apos;t play guitar .
did you know your daughter had been arrested
for driving under the influence ?
yes .
it was my fault she drank .
i push her .
no , we -- we both did .
she was so shy .
i @-@ i think she drank because she was terrified to perform .
her , uh , doctor suggested
she enter an addiction @-@ treatment program .
that &apos;s where she &apos;s been for the past month .
stanza rehab center . she was there yesterday ?
that &apos;s what we thought ,
but apparently they were allowing her to leave .
did she have a cellphone or a computer in rehab ?
uh , we kept her phone . stanza didn &apos;t allow it .
and she wasn &apos;t allowed use of the internet , either .
but she had a computer ?
for school work , yes .
did natasha have a boyfriend ?
no .
how about friends ?
she was never good at making friends .
i @-@ i can &apos;t imagine her going to a bar .
she brought a guitar to the bar . why would she do that ?
it doesn &apos;t make sense . she didn &apos;t play .
she wouldn &apos;t go to a bar .
but she was there , alexi .
oh , god , how did we get it so wrong ?
we are both so sorry for your loss .
what the hell ?
&quot; i cannot confirm or deny . &quot;
&quot; i cannot confirm or deny . &quot;
stanza rehab won &apos;t even confirm natasha was a patient .
we &apos;re gonna need a warrant to get her records .
i &apos;ve been going through her wallet .
she had a boston city all @-@ transit pass .
victim had a b @-@ cat pass ?
everything okay ?
no . but thanks for asking .
okay , uh , did you trace the pass ?
yeah , it &apos;s just coming up .
okay , this is weird .
she only took the green line ,
and she only got on and off at one station -- symphony .
she rode around in circles ?
maybe she never left the station .
yeah , there are a lot of buskers in that subway station .
what the hell is a busker ?
it &apos;s a street performer .
i hear the good ones can make like 700 bucks a day .
we are in the wrong line of work .
hey , you need to have a talent .
i got talent .
one that people will pay to see .
b @-@ cat transit makes you register with them
and issues a performer permit and i.d. badge , don &apos;t they ?
yeah . i &apos;ll check to see if she had a permit .
her mom said she was terrified of performing , though .
apparently that &apos;s what began the drinking .
nope , she wasn &apos;t registered .
hey , maybe we need to check out &quot; american idol . &quot;
that &apos;s where kids go to get discovered nowadays , right ?
no , man .
you blog and post and try to get yourself
on one of the big music sites , like pitchfork .
pitchfork ? what kind of name is that ?
a review on that blog
is like making the cover of rolling stonin your day .
her parents said she didn &apos;t play guitar .
those calluses on her fingers say different .
doesn &apos;t play guitar , doesn &apos;t drink ,
and yet we find her dead in a bar
with alcohol in her system and with a guitar .
yeah , on a night with a half @-@ hour of open mike
for female singer @-@ songwriters .
she was there to sing .
odds are she was in symphony station to sing , too .
maybe our shy , friendless classical musician
was leading a double life .
frost , can you do a search
to see if she posted anything with her singing ?
no , nothing using her name .
i &apos;m gonna try &quot; girl ,
symphony station , guitar . &quot;
yeah , here &apos;s something somebody else posted .
let &apos;s see what it is .
wow , what a voice .
yeah , she &apos;s the real deal .
nice lyrics .
hey , bitch , that &apos;s my spot !
hey , leave her alone !
hey , mind your own business !
and don &apos;t let me catch you here again !
this is my spot !
i &apos;m so sorry .
we need to find that guy .
hey , delroy , you got a minute ?
the name &apos;s busta bucket .
put some money in , and i might talk to you .
i thought your name was delroy .
yeah . delroy king ?
you did 10 years at walpole for manslaughter .
you five @-@ o ?
i &apos;m cool . i got my performance license .
which is for inside the subway at your assigned spot ,
not out here on the public street .
how come you left your spot down below ?
come on , man . this is hard work . it &apos;s hot down there .
where were you last night from 9 : 00 to 10 : 00 ?
with my old lady , banging a different kind of drum .
yeah .
you know this girl ?
no .
mind your own business !
and don &apos;t let me catch you here again !
this is my spot !
she came back , didn &apos;t she ?
that &apos;s why you followed her and stabbed her .
hell , no ! i didn &apos;t stab her !
i tried to scare her off , but ... the girl could sing .
so i let her work my spot ,
and she gave me some of the money .
well , she &apos;s dead now , delroy .
i didn &apos;t touch that girl !
all right , pack up your buckets .
what ? nah , i can &apos;t leave my station .
yeah , you can . you &apos;re gonna come down to our station
till we can check out your story .
let &apos;s go .
oh , is this the crinkled paper i found in her guitar case ?
you know , the crime lab
found traces of cacao @-@ bean extract on it .
chocolate ?
yeah .
where was she between rehab and the bar ?
and what was she hiding in the guitar case ?
what about mr. bucket ?
dead end . busta &apos;s alibi checks out .
he was with his old lady .
the neighbors saw him come home .
what if this is just some random killing that we can &apos;t solve ?
don &apos;t say that .
well , i mean , there are a lot of homicide departments
that have piles of unsolved cases like this one .
why are you talking like this ?
my father &apos;s psa numbers came back ,
and they &apos;re through the roof .
it &apos;s not a @-@ a very reliable test .
numbers can rise with a routine prostate examination
or even digital stimulation during sexual experimentation .
maura , stop .
have they done his ultrasound yet ?
it &apos;s tomorrow .
you want to come over for dinner ?
crap , i was gonna ask you the same thing .
what does that mean ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
tuna casserole .
vienna sausage wrapped in bacon with water chestnuts .
jello mold , boston cream pie .
um , where are the vegetables ?
right here . canned corn .
frank &apos;s favorite . we &apos;ll eat extra kale tomorrow .
how hard is it to remember where the fork goes ?
i &apos;ll show you where the fork goes .
boys , knock it off !
our guests are gonna be here any minute .
wait . guests , plural ?
i &apos;ll get it .
hey , pop .
hey . how you doing ?
all right .
how &apos;s my boy ? all right ?
i &apos;m good .
hi , frank .
nice flowers , huh , ma ?
yeah . thanks .
blue carnations ?
they &apos;re actually white .
but dip them in blue dye ,
with capillary action , you get that .
listen , i don &apos;t think this is a good idea tonight .
well , it &apos;s one bottle for six people .
it &apos;s all right . come on .
it &apos;s okay .
who &apos;s that ?
i told you we &apos;re gonna do things my way .
hi , honey .
thank you .
well , uh , we certainly have an interesting case
that we &apos;re working on , don &apos;t we , jane ?
yeah . uh ... yeah , why don &apos;t you tell them about it ?
um , well , it &apos;s tragic , really .
i &apos;ll say .
the case .
i mean , the victim .
she was a child prodigy .
i was a prodigy .
i could skate backwards when i was 3 .
that was me skating backwards holding you up .
you were no prodigy .
he -- he was like an idiot savant .
but that was because of the way he could play chess .
useless at everything else .
tommy did a lot of things well , pop .
and frankie here -- see this kid ?
this kid had a million @-@ dollar arm .
i thought you &apos;d be playing for the red sox .
me too .
he kept whining about his sore elbow .
want to know why ? you know what coach tony said ?
tommy , don &apos;t waste your breath .
no , i &apos;m gonna say it .
you made him throw so many curve balls , he threw his arm out .
nah . he was a quitter !
and you . be honest , you babied him .
frank , you know what alcohol does to your tongue .
don &apos;t embarrass me here .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m sober .
i &apos;m sober , too , frank .
it &apos;s okay , pop .
we all know what alcohol does to you .
yeah , and for the record , uh , frankie is a great detective .
and tommy is a great father .
you know , on that note , i got to go see my kid .
yeah . i &apos;m gonna get out of here , too .
thanks for dinner , ma .
hey . hey , i ...
hey , i was just busting balls .
i &apos;m just kidding !
where you going ? !
i &apos;m busting balls !
i think i should go , too .
i &apos;ll walk you out .
no , let him go !
i want to talk to my wife .
but she &apos;s not your wife no more , frank .
and you &apos;re gonna show some respect starting now .
yeah , come on . you gonna make me ? !
no , no ! come on . stop it !
stop it ! pop , stop !
let me take you to the motel , okay ?
take a look at yourself frank .
okay ? come on . come on .
come on . let &apos;s go to the motel .
just like i thought . you &apos;re a coward .
that &apos;s it , frank
no , stop it ! stop . sean .
go ahead , hurt angela again .
it won &apos;t be the prostate that kills you , frank .
sean , come on--
please , daddy . please .
just get him out of here ! just stop !
i &apos;m sorry .
you know , all that crap that you say to tommy and frankie --
you can &apos;t ever take that back , pop !
i &apos;m sorry , maura .
coffee ?
danish ?
what &apos;s the occasion ?
we just want you to know we care .
thank you .
my dad &apos;s an asshole , too .
okay , well , let &apos;s get back to work
so i don &apos;t spend the day in the fetal position .
frost , you said
the creep that stole natasha &apos;s credit card
said she was upset
about having other things taken ?
yeah .
he said she said something about ,
&quot; nobody else is taking anything from me tonight . &quot;
could she have meant something other than her purse ?
well , now we &apos;re talking .
we just got a warrant
to dig through natasha &apos;s stay at stanza .
let &apos;s take a ride to rehab .
i &apos;m not happy to be presented with a warrant with such a broad scope .
it &apos;s one thing to invade natasha &apos;s privacy .
this is a homicide investigation .
but natasha wasn &apos;t killed here .
check the visitors log .
she signed out at 7 : 35 p.m.
thank you . i think we will .
if you don &apos;t allow cellphones or access to the internet here ,
why would you allow your patients
to come and go at their own will ?
we provide structure here , but we also provide freedom .
it &apos;s not a prison .
are natasha &apos;s things still in her room ?
yes .
oh , i got her computer .
this doesn &apos;t get played much .
does that mean something ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s natasha &apos;s guitar .
her action was set up perfectly .
this one , the action &apos;s wrong . it &apos;s high , uneven .
holy crap .
where &apos;d you learn to play like that ?
i taught myself .
you could make real money on the subway .
then i wouldn &apos;t get to look at you all day long .
um , did natasha have a roommate ?
kelsey &apos;s in the music room .
she &apos;s leading natasha &apos;s memorial service .
* i found my rose in a hungry soul *
* and i &apos;ve seen troubles that no one should know *
* and i &apos;ve got scars and marks i can show *
* to remind me *
it &apos;s the same song natasha was singing in the subway .
natasha had a much better voice , though .
* and i &apos;m not out for blood , you see *
i &apos;m having trouble believing she &apos;s gone .
was there anyone here who had a problem with her ?
anyone that she didn &apos;t like ?
god , no .
i can &apos;t imagine anyone hurting her .
she was like a kitten or a puppy .
she barely talked .
how was she doing in rehab ?
okay , i guess .
she said she liked music therapy
as long as she didn &apos;t have to play in front of people .
play piano or guitar ?
or both ?
she only played piano .
but she had a guitar .
yeah , but i never heard her play it .
so you didn &apos;t know she was performing in the subway ?
i @-@ in public ? natasha ? no way .
that &apos;s why she wanted to leave the conservatory .
i wonder how her parents felt about that .
she said they flipped .
the conservatory &apos;s all about performance .
by senior year , that &apos;s all you do .
natasha couldn &apos;t perform unless she was loaded .
i &apos;m guessing she was trying to decide
between sobriety and performing .
according to stanza &apos;s visitors log ,
the only people who ever visited her were her parents .
so i &apos;m just wondering who did this .
did what ?
some of the files on natasha &apos;s hard drive have been wiped .
actually , it &apos;s a lot of them .
can you get it back ?
no .
and it wasn &apos;t password @-@ protected .
anybody could have done it .
i can &apos;t tell when , either .
i went through natasha &apos;s medical records at stanza .
there &apos;s nothing to indicate
she was taking any kind of marshmallow @-@ root supplement .
then how did that get in her stomach ?
you know , i &apos;ll check again
to see if there are any other uses for althea officinalis .
frost , you &apos;re sure the bar didn &apos;t sell any food or drinks
that has marshmallow root in it ?
yeah .
maybe somebody gave her a supplement ?
well , that &apos;s interesting .
what ? what did you find ?
it &apos;s speculation .
it &apos;s homicide . we speculate up here .
well , that &apos;s the flower for althea officinalis .
that &apos;s the marshmallow @-@ root flower .
on the bottle of mallow vodka .
which means there &apos;s marshmallow root in it .
it doesn &apos;t list the ingredients .
it doesn &apos;t have to .
look at the shape of the indentation .
that &apos;s what natasha had with her .
liquid courage . she was gonna sing that night .
but why would the killer take the bottle ?
i &apos;ve been looking at natasha &apos;s homework .
she was supposed to be composing classical symphonies .
but she &apos;s writing something else here .
that &apos;s the song that natasha was singing in the subway .
what , you think she composed it ?
maybe . but why hide it ?
maybe because her classical @-@ musician father
didn &apos;t approve of indie rock .
natasha &apos;s roommate , kelsey ,
got a gift basket delivered at 7 : 00 p.m.
natasha signed for it .
that &apos;s how the vodka got in .
that rehab place doesn &apos;t check deliveries .
barbara said natasha left the rehab facility at 7 : 35,
right after that gift basket was delivered .
the crinkle @-@ cut paper had chocolate on it .
yeah , and what would you put in a gift basket
that you were giving to someone
who was performing on camp fire night ?
the ingredients for smores .
yeah , chocolates and marshmallow vodka .
that &apos;s what natasha had in her guitar case ,
and that &apos;s why the killer took the bottle .
* no one else can make all our wrongs right *
* and then you said *
* we must pay for our own blundes *
* we must pay for our delights *
it sounds better when natasha sings it , doesn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m rehearsing . i &apos;ve got a show .
your shy roommate didn &apos;t know how valuable her songs were ,
but you did , didn &apos;t you ?
natasha told you she was gonna take that microphone
and sing her own song
in front of the record company that signed you .
broad sound records wanted to hear their new star .
because it &apos;s my song .
that &apos;s why broad sound records signed me .
when did you write it ?
about a month ago .
how did you do that ?
it was posted on youtube six months ago .
you don &apos;t even play that , do you ?
that &apos;s just a prop . you &apos;re no singer @-@ songwriter .
when you couldn &apos;t get your music career going ,
you started to drink .
rehab turned out to be just the break you needed .
too bad about that damn gift basket .
there it was on the card for natasha to read .
what did it say -- &quot; congrats on your new hit .
see you at the argot &quot; ?
natasha stole my gift basket so she could get drunk .
she was already unstable .
she showed up here angry and out of control .
she showed up to sing .
and when broad sound
heard her voice and her story --
that you &apos;d stolen her music and her lyrics --
your new career was over .
nice black nail polish . it &apos;s a new coat ?
we need a sample to see if it matches the stuff
we found in natasha &apos;s stab wounds .
i didn &apos;t mean for any of this to happen .
they all kept telling me ,
no , they wanted singer @-@ songwriters ,
so i took some of her songs .
i recorded them , and i put them up .
they went viral , and then it spun out of control .
you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of natasha osmanski .
what are you doing here ?
he came here to tell you something ... himself .
i came here to apologize ... to you , jane .
and you , maura .
i was a pig last night .
don &apos;t blame it on the wine , pop .
i said some terrible things .
i screwed up . i &apos;m sorry .
well , thank you for apologizing .
that must be hard for you .
it is .
it always has been .
but i got some good news .
i do have cancer , but they said it was ... stage ii .
that &apos;s very treatable .
i &apos;m glad to hear that .
i want you to forgive me , jane .
please .
you &apos;re my number @-@ one daughter .
i &apos;m your only daughter , pop .
okay , so , now what ?
i &apos;m thinking about moving back to boston .
you have a new life in florida , frank .
i have a new life here .
what are you saying , ang ?
i &apos;m saying ...
you &apos;re not my husband anymore .
you &apos;ll always be our children &apos;s father .
and i &apos;ll be here if you need me .
but you should go back .
jane ?
no , stay in touch , pop .
it &apos;s a short flight . come back anytime .
okay .
you take care of yourself , angela .
you too , frank .
goodbye , my sweet big girl .
i love you , daddy .
i love you , too .
all right .
okay .
so ...
now that we &apos;re all good and depressed ,
what should we do ?
i have some jello from last night .
nobody ate it .
well , that &apos;s a shock .
i have some cookies .
the ones that taste like cardboard ?
the night just gets better and better !
oh , good , well , i &apos;m glad i saved some for you .
i &apos;m really proud of the way you handled yourself , ma .
i &apos;m proud of you , jane ...
and your brothers --
that &apos;s who i &apos;m proud of .
and thanks for putting up with us nut balls , maura .
what do you mean , putting up with you ?
you &apos;re my nut balls ! you &apos;re my family .
