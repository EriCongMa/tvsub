it &apos;s a phone number .
let &apos;s call it .
i don &apos;t want to do this on the phone .
will you meet me ?
are we still on for saturday ?
i just don &apos;t know if i can handle it
if you &apos;re hurting yourself .
what does the dilaurentis family have on us ?
it &apos;s complicated .
my dad , is he your father too ?
let &apos;s go home .
where &apos;s home ?
that &apos;s a joke .
you just gotta stop working on these videos .
they &apos;re dangerous .
especially since the people that we &apos;re talking about
are in this town watching me .
take this home and burn it .
is it page five ?
there &apos;s nothing left that could link us to that night .
our championship rosewood sharks
are running a little behind
but they &apos;ll be here any minute .
i thought you couldn &apos;t get online in this cave .
i &apos;ve got a hotspot in my pocket .
yeah , i know , but what does that have to do with computers ?
i am the wifi .
koo @-@ koo @-@ katchoo .
where are they ?
i told my mom we &apos;d be studying at the library so that &apos;s covered .
good .
you sure you wanna do this tonight ?
yeah , are you kidding ?
we have to find out what this guy knows about ali .
and why his number was in ali &apos;s-- vivian &apos;s coat .
and we finally got this meeting set , so it &apos;s gotta be tonight .
look , we &apos;re gonna have your back the whole time .
i know .
so my mom talked to your mom .
you know it wasn &apos;t just one sleepover , spence .
it &apos;s been a whole week .
my mom just wants to know why you &apos;re not going home .
i just--
i can &apos;t deal with my family right now .
can i help ?
i know , the sign &apos;s kinda nerdy .
the sign &apos;s beautiful .
way to go , champ !
em , my mom said that we could have the team party at my house .
that &apos;s great !
caleb rivers ?
i got a court order here to impound your laptop .
what for ?
someone &apos;s been hacking into secure school files .
i traced them back to your ip address .
you think if i did something like that
i &apos;d be stupid enough to leave a trail ?
we &apos;ll find out . come on . hand it over .
any passwords we &apos;re gonna need ?
court order says you can take the machine .
it doesn &apos;t say anything about what &apos;s in my head .
what was that about ?
don &apos;t worry about it .
&quot; don &apos;t worry about it ? &quot;
he took your computer .
they couldn &apos;t get into it with a can opener .
be right back .
what just happened ?
garret took caleb &apos;s computer . court order .
why would you want me to forget about this ?
cause i think you &apos;re freaked out enough for the both of us .
hey . i didn &apos;t do what they think i did .
they &apos;re just fishing .
they made it up . there &apos;s nothing on my laptop .
what about the information from the phone we gave you ?
i keep it on flash drives . i back it up online .
besides , if there was shady stuff on my computer ,
it still wouldn &apos;t matter .
yes , it would . it does .
no , they couldn &apos;t get through my firewall .
not without my help .
caleb , you know how i was worried
about something bad happening to you
if you kept decoding the stupid phone ?
yeah .
well , this is it .
someone broke into your computer
and put those stolen files on your hard drive
where you wouldn &apos;t be able to find them .
and i think that someone might be garrett .
how do you know that ?
i just do .
so can &apos;t you just go online
and do that magic thing where you remotely
hack into your computer and erase all the scary , bad stuff ?
it &apos;s a real thing , right ?
yeah , i can do that .
holden , i told you .
i can &apos;t cover for you
unless i know what it is that you &apos;re doing
and why it involves these baggies filled with--
i do tang soo do .
what ?
it &apos;s a martial art . it &apos;s korean .
i compete , and my parents don &apos;t like it .
they forbid me to keep training .
are we talking , like , basements and naked light bulbs ,
people missing all their teeth ?
no . everyone &apos;s got teeth .
holden , i &apos;m serious .
that bruise was pretty intense .
all better .
those pills were just some pain meds
i never even used .
it &apos;s really not a big deal .
and there &apos;s a tournament coming up .
it &apos;s a big one , and tomorrow night &apos;s the qualifiers .
i-- i can &apos;t miss it .
so , please .
this is really important to me .
okay .
all right .
it &apos;s a date .
all the letters are initials of cities where i grew up
in the order that i lived there .
so , seattle , wilmette , etc .
i also alternate capital letters .
1105 ? what &apos;s that ?
nothing . just a number .
it &apos;s good to use numbers in your password .
just a number ? there was an exclamation point after it .
yeah , well , it &apos;s good to use punctuation , too .
once i &apos;m logged in ,
i can search and destroy all of the files i want .
crap !
what ? what &apos;s wrong ?
i can &apos;t connect .
well , don &apos;t you have your hot thing ?
spot . yeah , but the problem is on the other end .
either they haven &apos;t even tried to mess with my computer yet ,
or they &apos;re smart enough to keep it offline .
why are you having drinks with noreen ?
why do you think ?
aria needs a ride into the city .
holden ?
when did that happen ?
about 15 minutes ago .
well , i hate noreen .
i know , that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t invite you .
that one goes to the book fair .
you know , if you were open to letting aria take the train ,
i wouldn &apos;t have to find ways to kill time in philadelphia .
or , aria and holden can just do something right here in town .
byron , when are we gonna loosen the leash a little ?
hasn &apos;t she won back some of our trust ?
i mean , she stopped seeing fitz ,
she &apos;s dating a nice kid we &apos;ve known since pre @-@ school .
second guessing her every move
is starting to feel a little extreme .
no , dating your english teacher is extreme .
all right ? we are being parents .
we &apos;re being--
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just not ready yet .
okay ? i &apos;ll come back for the other box .
i &apos;ve been looking for you .
your office is closed .
yeah , i only work a couple hours a day .
getting the place up and running again .
did your father send you ?
no , i haven &apos;t talked to him .
you still don &apos;t believe it .
i believe it , that &apos;s why i haven &apos;t talked to him .
i haven &apos;t talked to anybody about this .
well , you better talk to your dad .
no , i &apos;m talking to you .
look , i didn &apos;t come back here to get between you and your father .
well , it &apos;s a little late for that .
i &apos;m sorry . i really am .
this was never about hurting you .
well , what is it about ?
please , jason .
you left town the night that i was arrested .
so what made you come back now ?
it was another one of those boxes ali liked so much .
i found it under the floorboards of a room at my grandmother &apos;s .
when i hide things , they stay hid .
something ali used to say .
there were letters to my mom from your dad .
love letters ?
couple of those .
then i &apos;m born , and he starts sounding like a lawyer .
&quot; in light of recent events . &quot; &quot; under the current situation . &quot;
that &apos;s my dad .
there was something else in that box .
$ 15,000 in cash .
in envelopes .
$ 5,000 in each one .
where would ali have gotten that kind of money ?
think about it .
she found those letters
and figured out what they meant
and then she blackmailed my father
to keep from blowing up both families .
i know .
it &apos;s hard to believe when you say it out loud .
yeah , but if anybody had the nerve to do something ,
that was ali .
so , you &apos;re a friend of vivian &apos;s .
yeah .
how much money does she owe you ?
vivian owes you money ?
she owes me a lot more than money .
she owes me a job
and she almost owes me a girlfriend .
thanks to you calling that number .
you said that she cost you a job . what did she do ?
i worked at allegheny cellular .
human resources .
your friend came in asking for a job ,
but she didn &apos;t want a job , she wanted information ,
and she said she &apos;d pay for it .
what kind of information ?
i get it .
you &apos;re alison .
vivian told you about alison ?
she said she had a friend named alison
who was getting texts from somebody .
the number was blocked
and she wanted to know where they were coming from .
she &apos;d pay to find out .
did you find out ?
yeah , i found out .
then i made the mistake of telling your pal
before i had the money in my hand .
she dropped off the map
and i got fired for accessing restricted information .
what did you find out about the person that was sending those texts ?
are you listening ? i did not get paid .
i want what she owes me .
how much does she owe you ?
$ 2,000 .
$ 2,000 dollars ?
that &apos;s the price today .
but it could go up depending on market conditions .
don &apos;t ever use that number again .
if you wanna do business , call me here .
oh , who do i ask for when i call ?
tell &apos; em you wanna talk to jonah .
he thought i was ali .
i mean , he doesn &apos;t know she is dead .
and if he finds out ,
there won &apos;t be enough money in the world to make him talk .
if this jonah had real information ,
ali might &apos;ve known who &quot; a &quot; was .
and that &apos;s why she was killed .
we have to find out
what he told her about those messages .
what are we supposed to do ?
throw a bikini car wash ?
even if we talked prudence finn into a tube top ,
we wouldn &apos;t raise enough money .
spencer ?
my account &apos;s been on lock down since we were arrested .
so where are we gonna get the money from ?
do have any idea when i can get the thing back ?
because i &apos;m a high school student .
i &apos;ve got papers to write and homework to do .
plus , they cost a lot of money .
plus , it &apos;s mine .
caleb , was that the cops ?
what &apos;d they say ?
they said i could get my laptop back today .
really ?
yeah , if i cooperate .
what &apos;re you going to do ?
so , we &apos;re on for tonight .
i worked things out on my end .
good , &apos; cause we really gotta talk about that interview .
i need to get back to shaffer tomorrow at the latest .
yeah , we &apos;ll talk about it .
i know this is a huge opportunity for you .
no , that &apos;s not what matters .
it &apos;s what your dad thinks if i don &apos;t take it .
yeah , well , maybe he should just move to new orleans .
we should have this conversation face to face ,
but i just don &apos;t really know where .
i do .
there &apos;s this tiny , hole in the wall , vegan place
that just opened up , center city .
wait , a restaurant ?
lower your expectations . it seats two .
oh , so it &apos;s bigger than your apartment .
what &apos;s it called ?
chez mirabelle vegan bistro .
french food ?
wow , you must really like me .
aria , it &apos;s french vegan food . i must really love you .
tempting , isn &apos;t it ?
the i.t. guys say not to open it .
it could connect to the wireless .
your , uh , your guys have any luck getting in ?
not yet .
might have to send it to pittsburgh .
i-- i bet we could get the kid to talk .
so , alison dilaurentis murder investigation
turned up a new piece of evidence .
it has to do with the missing page of the autopsy report .
tell me what you think is going on in this photo .
我知道 此致敬礼 -a
费城 巴拉兹北街 1267号
can &apos;t we get him a lawyer or something ?
i know you wanna help .
but caleb &apos;s got a family now .
and if he needs legal help--
he won &apos;t ask them .
he doesn &apos;t want them to know .
he &apos;s barely talking to me about it .
hello ?
i come bearing fruit .
great .
something wrong ?
um , can we talk ?
sure .
i &apos;ll be down in a minute .
okay . hey , maya .
hey .
put down the icing .
we &apos;ve been invited to the police station .
what do you mean it was an old joint ?
old , as in , pre @-@ getting busted
and packed off to camp straight and narrow .
where did your mom find it ?
we &apos;ve been getting stuff out of storage .
boxes from when we lived in the dilaurentis house .
i even found a box of ali &apos;s stuff .
it was in junk from my dresser .
half an old , dried @-@ up joint .
you explained that it was from before , right ?
they don &apos;t believe me .
em , my folks are gonna send me back to true north .
we &apos;ll go talk to your parents . we &apos;ll explain it .
i mean , they can &apos;t just ship you off again .
emily--
no !
i &apos;m not gonna say goodbye to you again .
never .
how you been , ashley ?
fine .
it &apos;s been a while .
doesn &apos;t feel that way to me .
i called you in to talk about alison &apos;s murder investigation .
copies of a particular page
of her autopsy report have been stolen .
we &apos;ve been looking into it .
and we found this .
this is from a security camera outside the morgue .
anything you can tell me about that photo , hanna ?
okay , it &apos;s almost time for you to give me my importance face .
and why weren &apos;t emily and spencer and their parents called in as well ?
hey . you may not have to answer his questions ,
but you &apos;re sure as hell going to answer mine .
what were you doing in those outfits ?
we put them on as a joke .
a joke .
we dared spencer to go in the morgue .
i didn &apos;t know there were files in there .
i already told you i know when you &apos;re lying .
we did not take that page .
mom said that spencer just left .
she go home ?
no , to hanna &apos;s .
em &apos;s throwing a victory party for the swim team .
so , where are you and holden headed off to this time ?
some new arcade .
they &apos;re supposed to have all these really cool vintage games .
ms. pacman , pinball ...
oh , that sounds fun .
yeah .
and , uh , what time is mom taking you ?
uh , now @-@ ish .
and you &apos;ll be home ... ?
at 11 , dad .
you meeting any other friends there ?
nope .
it &apos;s just me and holden .
and some nerdy gamers with very creative facial hair .
are you holding her up ?
no , she &apos;s-- she &apos;s all yours .
um , so maybe it &apos;s time you and holden
started hanging out a little closer to home .
holden just likes going into the city .
there &apos;s a lot more to do there .
museums and street fairs .
there &apos;s more than just one restaurant .
yeah , but from the way his mom talks , i mean--
i &apos;m surprised they &apos;re okay with him
being that far away all the time .
far away ? it &apos;s an hour .
you know what i mean . she &apos;s worried about him .
and if something happens--
what ?
mom , what would happen ?
honey , he has a heart condition .
he &apos;s talked about that with you , hasn &apos;t he ?
yeah . no , yeah , yeah . of course he has .
okay . well , you know . think about it .
the cops called them down there ?
which cops ?
i don &apos;t know .
there was a note on the counter
when i came downstairs with maya .
i &apos;m going upstairs
trusting you to keep an eye on everything down here .
okay .
hey . what &apos;s going on with caleb ?
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s not why we were called down there .
wilden &apos;s back .
he still thinks we had something to do with ali &apos;s murder .
there &apos;s a photo of the three of us outside the coroner &apos;s office
looking for page five .
&quot; a &quot; was following us ?
no . security cameras .
there &apos;s an investigation going on .
he said the copies of that page are missing .
copies ? as in every copy ?
if the cops don &apos;t have it then it had to have been an inside job .
garrett .
officer two @-@ face is gonna open that laptop .
i mean , what if caleb goes to jail ?
it &apos;s gonna be all my fault .
it &apos;s not gonna happen .
what &apos;re you doing ?
jonah knows something that could help us
figure out what really happened to alison .
wilden is just gonna keep on coming after us .
so we need to find out who killed alison
so we can prove it wasn &apos;t us .
okay ,
unless you found $ 2,000 while i was out--
where are you going ?
home .
there was some weird energy in that car .
is your mom starting to wonder ?
no . no , they &apos;re clueless .
okay , well i &apos;m this way and i &apos;m gonna be late .
you know where you &apos;re going ?
yeah .
holden .
this tournament , is it dangerous ?
i get it . you &apos;re still on that bruise .
don &apos;t worry .
i got a rematch against the guy who gave it to me .
it &apos;s gonna be epic . wish me luck .
spencer ?
i &apos;m glad you came home .
your mother and i were both getting our degrees .
she was in boston .
ken and jessica had an apartment on willoughby .
then what happened ?
what happened is ,
i made a series of very poor decisions .
you make it sound like a business deal .
this wasn &apos;t a bad investment .
you cheated .
and you got somebody else &apos;s wife pregnant .
that &apos;s what happened .
yes .
and she kept the baby .
she kept the baby .
she lied to her husband , they moved to atlanta .
i married your mother .
just like nothing happened .
then they moved back .
yeah , right next door .
you were five .
first time i saw jason , he was in front of that house .
just riding his bike .
and how did that make you feel ?
why did they come back ?
i never asked .
i was afraid she might tell me .
jason thinks that alison knew about you long before he did .
i guess that &apos;s possible . i don &apos;t know .
really ? you sure that you don &apos;t know ?
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
it means that jason found some money
and letters from you .
so did ali ever ask you for money ?
for what ?
to keep her quiet ?
spencer , wai--
look , i know i don &apos;t have a lot of credibility with you right now .
but you have to listen to me .
i never gave money to anyone
in that family for any reason .
um , do you mind if i sit over there ?
thanks .
thank you .
i hope your mom got paige coming off the platform .
she was like a rocket .
em ...
you okay ?
i guess i &apos;m not in a party mood .
can we go someplace ?
after the party ? sure .
em ! you &apos;re missing it !
go ahead . i &apos;m okay .
go .
what ? and you believe him ?
yes , i do .
he must &apos;ve been really convincing .
i think that he was telling me the truth .
if he didn &apos;t give ali this money , then who did ?
well , where is it now ? the money .
does he want you to get it back ?
no . i already told you he didn &apos;t give it to her .
just because you believe him doesn &apos;t mean i have to .
if ali was blackmailing somebody--
not somebody , spencer . it was your father .
well , what if it wasn &apos;t ?
it has to be him .
you don &apos;t want it to be someone else .
you want it to be him so that you can keep on being angry .
yeah . you were raised by lawyers .
maya ?
hey ! where are you ?
i thought you &apos;d be here an hour ago .
that actually might be a while .
well , where are you right now ?
police station .
what , you &apos;re going to talk to them ?
i don &apos;t think i have any choice .
so you said garrett knows how to get in anyway ?
i don &apos;t know . i think so .
hanna , listen to me . i &apos;m in a really hot spot right now .
i know , caleb .
hanna , i need your help .
this way .
what &apos;re you doing here ?
what &apos;s wrong with your heart ?
excuse me ?
my mom says that you have some kind of condition .
what &apos;re you doing ?
is this some kind of death wish ?
just keep your voice down .
now what exactly did your mom tell you ?
it doesn &apos;t matter . i wanna hear it from you .
okay , i wanna know exactly what i &apos;m supposed to say
when you don &apos;t make it back at the end of the night
because somebody kicked you in the chest .
that &apos;s not gonna make my heart stop , aria .
i have an abdominal aortic aneurism , okay ?
wh-- tell me what that means .
it means that i gotta live with it .
it could rupture whether i &apos;m out doing what i love
or i &apos;m at home playing apples to apples with my parents .
i &apos;m not gonna spend the rest of my life
sitting in front of a tv .
especially when there &apos;s a decent chance
it &apos;s gonna be shorter than everyone else &apos;s .
but not telling your parents that you &apos;re doing this ,
it &apos;s really , really messed up , holden .
okay , and i know that i &apos;m lying to mine , too ,
but it not &apos;s like i &apos;m taking my life into my own hands .
look , sometimes what people believe is best for you
is not what is actually best for you .
gentlemen , line up . turn , face the table .
to your positions .
bow to each other .
fight stance .
we &apos;re glad we didn &apos;t have to contact
any of your family in california .
i know that would &apos;ve been hard on you ,
the way this sort of thing looks .
you don &apos;t have to call them .
i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
you asked me to come in , here i am .
i wanna watch you login .
make sure there &apos;s no funny business .
okay .
you sure you want me to show him what &apos;s on here ?
start typing .
i got your s.o.s. what &apos;s wrong ?
please tell me you know how to hack into computers .
uh , no .
that &apos;s what caleb was for .
well , caleb is at the police station right now
cooperating with this whole investigation .
unless we figure out how to hack into his hard drive
and delete all the files &quot; a &quot; planted , he &apos;s screwed .
okay . do you know his password ?
i did .
that wasn &apos;t an old joint your mother found .
it wasn &apos;t a new joint , it just wasn &apos;t that old .
why would you lie to me ?
i &apos;m a guest in this house and my teammates--
oh , god , please .
no more about the teammates .
what &apos;s wrong with them ?
nothing , nothing . they &apos;re perfect .
maya .
you &apos;re better at fitting in than i am .
i thought you didn &apos;t care about that .
yeah , well , i &apos;m pretty convincing .
listen , we can still talk to your parents .
i won &apos;t go back to true north .
we &apos;ll work it out .
no way i &apos;m going back there .
i &apos;ve got friends in san francisco .
you can &apos;t just run away .
you could come with me .
i can &apos;t do that .
not even for me ?
no , i guess you couldn &apos;t .
not with the team counting on you .
okay , it &apos;s the first initials of every city he lived in .
seattle , wilmette , salt lake ,
denver , allentown , rosewood .
in that order ?
yes . oh , and he alternates capiltal and lower case letters .
wow this is almost as complicated as my password .
any punctuation ?
yes ! an exclamation point after the last four numbers .
last four numbers ?
there are four more numbers ?
okay , what are they ?
ready . go !
ready--
登录
stand over there .
go .
what else could it be ?
i don &apos;t know !
we only have one more try until we &apos;re locked out of the systems ..
just think , hanna !
i am thinking !
this is me thinking ! and molting !
you said , 1 , 1 , something , 5 .
1 , 1 , something , 5 . 1 , 1 , something--

ready and bow !
winner , red side !
you stayed .
didn &apos;t you have a date ?
we rescheduled .
i &apos;m not used to having an audience .
it &apos;s nice .
maybe you can come to the next--
no . thank you .
you were amazing .
i still think you &apos;re an idiot though .
look , i get not wanting to rot in front of the tv ,
but this ...
this can &apos;t be what the doctor ordered .
no , he recommended gardening . this is better .
dad . hey , what &apos;s up ?
yeah , yeah , i &apos;m just at the arcade with holden .
yeah , i know , sorry . it &apos;s kind of loud in here .
um , sure .
he wants to talk to you .
hi , mr. montgomery .
yeah , i-- i &apos;m sorry to bother you .
ella just thought she lost your mom &apos;s number .
thanks . okay .
yeah , you too , holden .
did it .
what ?
1105 ? november 5th ?
you couldn &apos;t have just told me
that it was the night that we--
you know .
hanna , there &apos;s an exclamation point .
let &apos;s get out of here .
no . let &apos;s throw it in his face a little longer .
he &apos;s not here .
i know .
i checked for his car .
i wanted to talk to you .
look , if i screwed up before ,
i am sorry .
i don &apos;t really have an etiquette book
for how people in our situation
are supposed to treat each other .
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s sorry .
you are ?
because you were right , spencer .
i don &apos;t wanna find out ali was blackmailing someone else .
i want it to be him .
because ?
