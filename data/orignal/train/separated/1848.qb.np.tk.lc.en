the human body is a highly pressurized system .
the blood pressure measures the force of blood
pulsating through the arteries .
great .
what the hell am i gonna do now ? !
it &apos;s important to keep this pressure regulated .
damn it !
damn it !
when a heart wasn &apos;t available , i opted to continue
with roy henley &apos;s lung transplant ...
low or inadequate pressure can cause weakness or failure .
it &apos;s all in your head .
my name isn &apos;t on the o.r board .
i checked the schedule . nobody wants to work with me ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m not on anybody &apos;s service .
it &apos;s an oversight , okay ?
just -- just ask around .
do you know how many things
i &apos;ve screwed up in the last month ?
stop it . i &apos;m serious . just ask around
and get on someone &apos;s service and get back to work .
... suggested no pulmonary sepsis .
you smell like you &apos;re sweating booze .
where have you been ?
i want the weekend you had .
what happens in vegas , you know ?
hey , who &apos;s stark ? i &apos;m supposed to be on stark &apos;s service today .
oh , me , too . he &apos;s the new peds attending ,
since robbins left .
crap .
i can &apos;t handle a bunch of sick kids today .
i can &apos;t do it .
so was it a bachelor party or --
shh . they &apos;re talking about cristina .
it became clear to dr. yang
that they were gonna need to switch modalities .
the patient was put on ecmo ...
it &apos;s when the pressure gets too high
that problems really occur .
and why did dr. yang
opt to use the intra @-@ aortic balloon pump over an r @-@ vad ?
i , um ...
i can &apos;t answer for dr. yang .
and why isn &apos;t she here ?
she , um ...
she quit .
she left the program .
i &apos;m sorry . what ? she what ?
dr. yang cleared the balloon pump with dr. mcqueen ...
who agreed that it was the best --
go back . go back .
yang quit the program ?
yeah , where have you been ?
well , that &apos;s the first i &apos;ve heard of it .
hunt , what the hell happened ?
she told the chief she quit .
richard -- - if we could just finish the presentation , then --
i have a question . can you tell us about
your decision to put dr. yang in charge of this patient ?
sorry ?
but she didn &apos;t &quot; quit &quot; quit , right ?
grey .
you &apos;re joined at the hip . what &apos;d she say ?
uh , she hasn &apos;t spoken to me about it .
if the pressure continues to increase ,
a closer examination is called for ...
stop looking at me . look up there .
does torres know anything about this ?
i &apos;m calling torres .
can we please just --
look , i guess i &apos;m asking you , why did you choose
to put dr. yang under so much pressure that day ?
i didn &apos;t . i intended the opposite .
i gave her a simple pre @-@ op checklist
on a stable patient .
stable patient ?
the patient almost died twice .
i couldn &apos;t have seen that coming .
i &apos;m sorry .
is this a , uh , a patient presentation
or a postmortem on dr. yang ?
well , you saved the patient .
because it &apos;s the best indicator
that something is going terribly wrong .
hey , mark .
no , no , i was , um ...
i was actually on my way out . what &apos;s up ?
she what ? !
i don &apos;t know what shepherd &apos;s problem is .
what the hell was that ? how is she doing ? is she --
oh , we &apos;re -- i don &apos;t know . she &apos;s --
we &apos;re good . we &apos;re fine . it &apos;s like nothing has changed ,
yet she refuses to talk about work .
i bring up work , and she goes blank .
altman , hunt .
emergent patient ten minutes out .
can you meet me in the v.i.p. wing ?
v.i.p. wing ? who is it ?
oh , you &apos;ll find out when we get there .
listen , hunt , i &apos;m required to send a letter
to the american board of surgery declaring that dr. yang
has officially left the residency program .
i have to let &apos; em know . i &apos;m asking you ,
is there any reason i need to hold off on sending that letter ?
yes .
yes .
please don &apos;t mail it .
just give us a little more time .
okay . let &apos;s go .
grey , who are you with today ?
shepherd .
damn it . i &apos;ve already blown it with shepherd .
i can &apos;t ask him .
uh ... bailey . i haven &apos;t blown it with her yet .
he thinks no one wants to work with him .
are they saying that or are you saying that ?
here you go , doctor .
who are you with again ?
karev .
uh , i mean stark .
no , you meant karev .
and you don &apos;t want to go there .
you don &apos;t know where i &apos;m going .
he &apos;s right . you don &apos;t want to go there .
i &apos;m not -- i &apos;m not going anywhere .
he &apos;s not the guy for you . okay ? trust me .
and don &apos;t be paranoid . trust me on that , too .
oh , but it &apos;s okay for you to go there ?
i &apos;m a guy . i live there .
i gotta find bailey .
hello !
cristina !
oh , hey . hello .
hello !
hello !
uh ... what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m not back until next week .
wait . so it &apos;s true ?
you guys broke up ? uh , she &apos;s in africa ?
okay , sloan told me that you quit .
hey . what are you doing ? !
this . go away .
okay , this is disturbing .
hey , stop !
look , i was unpacking ,
but then i didn &apos;t enjoy it .
what are you doing ?
what do you mean ?
you don &apos;t have a job to go to .
you don &apos;t have a girlfriend
telling you you have to go to africa .
you &apos;re completely free . you can do whatever you want .
the world is your oyster . make lemonade .
i &apos;m trying . i was gonna get my hair cut today ,
like , make a radical change , but , uh , then i thought ,
hmm , maybe you shouldn &apos;t do radical things
right after a blonde woman
has ripped your heart out of your chest
and stomped on it . what are you --
oh , my god ! what are you doing ? !
are you insane ? !
let &apos;s make lemonade .
oh , my god .
oh , 97.6
stick out your tongue .
ow ! cut it out .
we &apos;ll have fun today .
stark &apos;s a got a 4 @-@ month @-@ old biliary atresia patient
who just found a donor .
a liver transplant on an infant ?
enough with the damn ping @-@ pong balls !
jerkface !
whoa . inside voices here , please .
so you must be dr. karev .
you missed my rounds today .
oh , sorry . i- i had car trouble .
oh . well , there &apos;s a classic .
so what , you &apos;re here just to kinda yell at my patients and--
yeah , i &apos;m sorry .
look , d @-@ dr. stark , i am feeling very sick today .
so i think that , you know , since you ...
well , let &apos;s see here .
no fever . you don &apos;t seem to be vomiting .
you retaining control of your bowels ?
yes .
well , since hangovers are not contagious ,
i &apos;d say you &apos;re working .
and you can start by prepping my atresia kid .
she &apos;s only a few months old , so try not to be a jerkface .
gimmie that !
dr. webber , ronald dace , state department .
we spoke on the phone . these your surgeons ?
uh , yes , this is dr.--
right now ,
we need to limit access to this area to only essential personnel .
uh , why is that necessary ?
no one can know this man is being hospitalized .
no one can know he &apos;s in the country .
board the panel . get me a reading .
got it .
stand by where you are .
he &apos;s in v @-@ fib . charge to 200 .
and from a global perspective ,
it would be great if he didn &apos;t die .
clear .
clear !
they faxed more of his records .
these are all in arabic .
clear !
it was a car accident ?
the emir &apos;s car
was hit by a truck as he was leaving the meeting .
what &apos;s he doing in seattle ?
he &apos;s not .
let it suffice to say , if he dies ,
we &apos;ve got a serious international incident .
well , not to mention ,
his people are supposed to see their first elections , right ?
i &apos;m not at liberty to--
unless he dies , in which case ,
then the door is open for al @-@ qaeda to move in ,
and then your secret meeting was for nothing .
you don &apos;t just skip to the crossword , do you ?
well , i used to work in that neck of the woods .
i know , dr. altman-- three years in baghdad ,
two years in landstuhl .
wow . you guys are fast .
we are .
listen , our best outcome here is that we get him stable enough
to be put on a plane home .
our best outcome is we save him .
he takes two medications--
one for high blood pressure , one for his cholesterol .
uh , he was hospitalized late last year for exhaustion .
did he receive any treatment then ?
no , just rest . working too hard .
he works very hard .
uh , he has a wife , four children ...
five , uh , if you count me .
he &apos;s more than my boss . he &apos;s been , um ...
he &apos;s given me everything , so please ...
we &apos;ll do everything we can .
he &apos;s in v @-@ fib .
all right , charge to 300 .
clear !
we &apos;ll bring your baby up soon .
lisa . her name is lisa .
the donor was an adult ,
so the liver will actually be split between your baby--
lisa . sorry . we read that
if the doctor knows your baby &apos;s name ,
it helps you to kind of bond with her .
we read that &apos;s important .
will dr.stark be splitting the liver in situ ?
we know that ex vivo takes less time ,
but we also read that in situ gives better results .
w- we &apos;re not trying to tell you how to do your job , we--
oh , no , no , no , of course not . please don &apos;t apologize .
we &apos;ll find out for you .
one second .
yeah , you want to blow up
as many of those guys as you can .
dr. stark .
there you go . you got it . you got it .
dr. stark , uh , can you come talk to the collises , please ?
they &apos;ve got a lot of questions .
yeah , i gotta check on that kid &apos;s harvest team .
did you ever hang glide ?
what ? i-- no .
it &apos;s apparently a very good way to become a liver donor .
wait , sir , are you splitting the liver
in the body or ex vivo ? the parents want to know .
okay .
those folks have been spending a little too much time
consulting dr. internet .
listen , just hold their hands , let them feel smart ,
and tell them i am busy getting their baby a liver .
her name &apos;s lisa .
i said i don &apos;t need any help .
i &apos;ve got an easy day-- two laparoscopic surgeries .
i can &apos;t use you .
yeah , well , maybe i can--
i &apos;m sorry , ma &apos;am . i can &apos;t admit you .
well , you don &apos;t need to admit me .
i &apos;ll just walk in there myself . i do it all the time .
oh-- uh , chief webber paged me in there .
i &apos;m sorry , ma &apos;am .
well , who &apos;s in there ?
is it the president or the vice president ?
is it bono ?
bono ?
ma &apos;am , i &apos;m sorry . i cannot--
bailey ,
can you take my patients today ?
i got a situation in here .
oh , of course , sir .
louise cortez is a readmit after surgery
for chronic pancreatitis . c.t. showed a pancreatic fistula .
and she spiked a fever this morning .
right . uh , sir , you put in a drain ?
yes , just keep a close eye .
okay . sir .
is it bono ?
come on , avery .
i could use you .
okay , but i don &apos;t understand . i &apos;m on your service .
i don &apos;t need you . the craniotomy &apos;s been canceled .
i don &apos;t have anything for the rest of the day .
so what am i supposed to do now ?
go study .
study what ?
i don &apos;t care , lexie . go somewhere else .
oh , my god . mm .
how do we have time for this ?
we have to make time for this . mm .
should i call her ?
call who ?
cristina .
what ? why ?
because she quit , and i feel - like i should do something .
it &apos;s not your fault .
you didn &apos;t do anything wrong , no matter what she says .
okay ? you just need to make time for this .
but--
oh , my god . lexie .
what ?
i &apos;m looking for dr. meredith grey .
what did you do ?
how &apos;s it going ?
can i see ?
fantastic . shut up .
okay .
hey , you know what you need to , uh , get this place done ?
you need to throw a housewarming party .
put a little pressure on yourself .
oh , my god . we should totally throw a housewarming party .
oh , my god !
oh , my god , no .
tonight ! i &apos;ll text everyone .
no !
yes ! i have several credit cards
and nothing to do .
okay , that &apos;s not what i wanted .
i look-- i @-@ i look injured .
i mean , do you even cut hair ?
i need furniture .
look at my hair !
yeah . i sorta can &apos;t believe you let me do that .
cristina !
it &apos;s okay . we &apos;ll go to the mall .
you might want a hat .
clear !
we need to get him to a cath lab .
yeah , well , if he &apos;d stop coding long enough .
i &apos;m inserting a pacemaker .
you paged ?
yeah , grey , grab me a pacemaker kit .
hey , hunt , you &apos;re throwing
a housewarming party tonight ?
tonight ? i am ?
well , your wife is . that &apos;s a good sign , right ?
it &apos;s a weird sign .
well , but maybe it &apos;s an opportunity .
i mean , maybe i could talk to her .
wait . better yet , maybe you could , grey .
well , we all could .
i mean , it &apos;s gonna be hard for her
to walk out of a room at her own party .
how bad is it ?
i &apos;ll tell you when i know .
maybe a little less party planning .
hey , i don &apos;t tell you how to polish your sunglasses .
look , between you and me , he &apos;s a good man .
and it &apos;d be a shame if something like this
screwed up what he was trying to do .
wow . every time i talk to you , i feel a little more relaxed .
the last thing cristina wants is to talk to me .
i just have to give her some space .
we don &apos;t have time to give her space .
she &apos;s gonna be locked out of this program ,
and i do not believe that that is what she wants .
i mean , do you think that &apos;s what she wants ?
i &apos;m asking you , grey .
i still don &apos;t understand what i &apos;m doing back here .
dr. webber said something about a fist .
a fistula .
it &apos;s a complication from your surgery
that &apos;s leaking pancreatic fluid .
the drain takes the fluid out of your body
so it won &apos;t go where it &apos;s not supposed to .
okay .
th @-@ the pancreatic fluid is made to digest your food .
if it leaks in your body , it starts to digest your other organs .
well , that wouldn &apos;t be good .
exactly , but not to worry .
yours is looking just fine .
i just want to keep a close eye on you , okay ?
well , it seems like i just was home , and here i am again .
you know , i say that every morning .
dr. bailey , o.r. &apos; s ready .
okay . um , mrs. cortez ,
your temperature is still a little high .
so you just rest ,
and we &apos;ll get you home in no time .
okay .
okay , you &apos;re not scrubbing in .
i &apos;m not ...
no , watch mrs. cortez .
if the fluid in her drain changes color , you page me .
if her fever goes up one digit , you page me .
&apos;cause the fever could be--
an abscess , early sepsis , pneumonia--
any number of nasty things .
and remember your first rule of residency--
eat when you can , sleep when you can ...
and don &apos;t screw with the pancreas .
so much for my easy day .
nice anastomoses .
no leaks .
how are we doing ? we good ?
it &apos;s not ...
no , it &apos;s not quite fitting , is it ?
there &apos;s not enough room in the peritoneal cavity for the graft .
the liver &apos;s too big ?
uh , the baby is too small .
b.p. 64 over 40 .
it &apos;s compressing the hepatic vessel . sponge .
no , no , no . larger , larger , larger . there we go .
let &apos;s get this sponge tucked up under there ,
take the pressure off the vessels ,
and ... yeah , that &apos;s doing the trick there .
all right . i think we &apos;re done .
but the liver &apos;s not gonna fit .
we &apos;re not gonna be able to close her up today .
just wrap her .
this happens with adult split livers .
you just gotta sit tight
hope that the swelling goes down enough so you can close her up .
well , how long will that take ?
as long as it takes , karev .
thank you all . great work .
this graft is big .
the swelling-- it &apos;s gonna take a lot to go down .
how long can it stay like that , with that sponge in her ?
i don &apos;t know .
isn &apos;t it just gonna start to deteriorate ?
i mean , she could get infected .
and-- and what if the swelling doesn &apos;t go down enough ?
the liver will die , and she &apos;ll be back on the donors &apos; list .
oh , jeez . how is this a solution ?
it &apos;s not .
um , how can you not talk to meredith about this ?
she &apos;s your best friend .
ooh , i love that lamp .
you can &apos;t just cut yourself off from a person ,
pretend your whole relationship never happened .
i mean , you can ,
but it makes you a heartless , soulless monster
who i thought i knew , but really didn &apos;t .
with wheels on her shoes .
ugh . god , how was i okay with that ?
i used to be a lot cooler than that .
i was a lot cooler when i was single .
you were hardly ever single .
i know . i know .
oh , i &apos;m actually excited to spend time on my own .
okay , i thought we were going to a hair salon .
next . we &apos;re doing me now .
can i help you find something ?
yes , i will take that .
that sofa ?
that room . all of it . i &apos;ll take it .
uh , you do same @-@ day delivery , right ?
great .
so it went very well .
the baby looks good , liver looks good ,
and i think we can all exhale a little bit now .
when can we see her ?
soon . we &apos;d like to keep an eye on her .
there &apos;s a little bit of swelling , and i want to see that go down ,
but , uh , yeah , we &apos;ll let you know .
thank you .
thank you so much , dr. stark .
just ... thank you .
yeah , my pleasure entirely .
you aren &apos;t gonna tell them any more than that ?
what would you want me to tell them , karev ?
well , that there &apos;s a chance of infection ,
that if the liver doesn &apos;t actually conform ...
they could be back on the donors &apos; list .
i mean , they &apos;re smart people .
they want to know what could go wrong .
and make them more worried than they already are ?
i think you &apos;re not worried enough .
tell me a better solution .
i , uh--
can you give me a better solution ?
no .
well , then keep your mouth shut
and go do something you can do .
you can start with my post @-@ ops .
you tried .
okay , since when is it okay to shoot people in this hospital ?
now bailey &apos;s given up on me , too .
you &apos;re on her service . why are you still freaking out ?
no . bailey &apos;s in surgery . she trusts me
to watch her post @-@ op
drip fluid into a bag every ten minutes .
okay , inappropriate .
okay , you should relax . you get an easy day , you take it .
shepherd didn &apos;t need me ,
so i took a nap in the research library .
give me-- give it to me .
jerkface .
he &apos;s having a rough day . new robbins is no robbins .
check this out-- armed escort to get a yogurt .
okay , who is it ? is it bono ?
it &apos;s totally bono . it &apos;s all over the hospital .
it &apos;s not bono .
are you going to cristina &apos;s tonight ?
i don &apos;t know .
okay ...
not okay .
okay , that &apos;s addicting .
put it away before my guy
wrestles you to the ground .
gimmie that .
no .
gimmie the ball .
no .
what &apos;s his problem ?
he &apos;s having a rough day .
jeez , i &apos;m coming .
the emir &apos;s cath confirmed
that he does have a tear in one of his coronary arteries .
we &apos;ve stabilized him with a balloon pump , but i am
gonna have to perform open @-@ heart surgery to repair the tear .
doctor ! doctor !
doctor ! doctor , please was the tear in his--
quiet , please .
please . was the tear in his artery
an injury sustained in the car accident ?
there is no way of--
doctor , don &apos;t answer that .
there is no way of knowing if that was the cause .
can we have assurances that your finest surgeons
will be operating on his highness ?
yes .
uh , these are the chiefs of my cardiothoracic
and trauma departments .
sorry . he was asking your state department .
he didn &apos;t mean the finest surgeons in this hospital .
which is why you might be more comfortable
traveling to your own country , where he can--
all right . all right . quiet . quiet , please .
quiet , please . thank you .
i understand there are a lot of concerns
and agendas here .
but we all have the same goal ,
and that is to see this man live .
now we are out of time , which means we are out of options .
i am your only shot , and you have to take me .
i can only say that if you knew me better ...
you &apos;d feel pretty good about your chances .
dr. hunt and i are going to operate ,
and we will update you as soon as we can .
good luck .
you have to tell them to stop .
tell them they can &apos;t operate .
w- why ? what &apos;s the problem ?
come with me .
he didn &apos;t want anyone to know . he made me swear .
just tell him what you told us .
four months ago , the emir was diagnosed with
an unruptured cerebral aneurysm in his left temporal lobe .
he &apos;s in c.t. now ?
well , his first neuro came up clear ,
but now he &apos;s got a blown pupil .
so we think it &apos;s burst .
the scan should be up by now .
i swore to him ,
i wouldn &apos;t say anything till after the election .
i &apos;m still not sure i should &apos;ve told you .
i might be costing him everything .
you &apos;re trying to save his life .
he &apos;s trying to save seven million lives ,
to make it so seven million people can walk the street
without the fear of being murdered by the extremists .
he doesn &apos;t , um ... he risks his life
every time he steps out his door .
you &apos;re trying to protect him , too .
and i &apos;m sure he understands now .
he was headed to surgery ?
yeah , we &apos;re going in on a dissected coronary artery .
oh , yeah , that aneurysm &apos;s blown .
damn it . that &apos;s a huge bleed .
well , i &apos;m not surprised .
he was shocked seven times and given blood thinner ,
which is unfortunate .
he presented like an m.i. i treated him appropriately .
i couldn &apos;t have seen this coming .
yeah , you &apos;ve been saying that a lot today .
you know what , shepherd ? i don &apos;t need crap from you .
apparently i hold the whole fate of
the middle east in my hands .
apparently , now i do , too .
book an o.r. we &apos;re gonna
have to work simultaneously .
oh , can &apos;t wait .
cristina &apos;s having a party ? cristina yang ?
yeah , i know , but ... i &apos;m gonna go .
we &apos;re all gonna go and talk to her .
and you should come , too .
i mean , you quit once . you walked away and came back .
so maybe you have something to say that could help .
no .
no ?
do you remember
when you came out to talk to me about coming back ?
do you remember when i hit your engagement ring
with a baseball bat ?
oh , that was a great day .
she &apos;s already lashing out .
don &apos;t go and try to confront her .
no intervention on cristina yang .
do you hear me ? it &apos;s a bad idea .
what are you sterilizing ?
you &apos;re kidding me ?
what was so important ?
sir , i was out of line earlier ,
but , uh , i think i found a solution
for lisa collis &apos; liver .
what is that , a ping @-@ pong ball ?
it &apos;s the perfect shape to keep the liver
from compressing her blood vessels .
it &apos;s made of celluloid not plastic ,
so it won &apos;t break down like a sponge will .
it &apos;s gas sterilized , so there &apos;s little risk of infection .
i mean , you could leave it in there forever .
her liver will just grow around it .
i mean , i think it &apos;s a ...
you think it won &apos;t work .
no .
i was thinking , i left you to do my post @-@ ops ,
and here i find you playing with balls .
i don &apos;t know , karev .
am i gonna have to talk to your chief about you ?
yeah , right .
mm , i want it sort of , like , badass , you know ?
a little dangerous , a little unpredictable .
did you bring a picture ?
mm . it &apos;s more of a feeling .
what do they do all day-- the mall people ?
look at them . they move so slowly .
they all mosey . look .
yeah , i , uh , can &apos;t turn my head .
do they just eat things and ... buy things
and complain about their breakups ?
yes .
fantastic . look at that lady .
she &apos;s just gonna eat that pretzel .
that &apos;s all she &apos;s gonna do .
so what are you gonna do ?
you &apos;re just gonna become a mall person ,
shop and eat ?
this yogurt &apos;s pretty good .
i &apos;m serious .
i &apos;m getting a pretzel .
avery , how &apos;s our patient ?
oh , no change .
oh , that &apos;s what i like to hear . i &apos;m going into my chole .
so you-- you still don &apos;t want
me to scrub in or--
no . i need you to watch--
mrs. cortez .
right . well , like i said , no change .
avery , i need you where i need you .
i don &apos;t have time .
no , ma &apos;am . that &apos;s fine .
i get it .
i &apos;m saying , with this letter , there &apos;s a time frame now .
you &apos;re content to stand back
and watch cristina
lose her spot in this program ?
i &apos;m saying an intervention is not a good plan .
suction .
it &apos;s not an intervention , shepherd .
we just thought , since we were all together--
torsades !
damn it . he &apos;s in v @-@ fib . all right , shepherd .
i need you to stop . we have to shock him .
no , wait . i &apos;m right in the middle of--
internal paddles .
all right , charge to 10 .
hold on . hold on !
shepherd .
clear .
sinus tach .
hey , did stark ever respond to my page ?
he &apos;s got three discharges .
one of them has just come yesterday .
dr. stark is in surgery .
he went back in lisa collins .
what ?
it &apos;s a great idea .
it &apos;s so simple .
we &apos;ll see if it works .
it is the right shape , and it &apos;s celluloid ,
so it won &apos;t break down ,
and the liver will conform to it .
it &apos;s a great idea .
whose idea was it , dr. stark , originally ?

then they get severe complications ,
then they died . i did what you said .

because it-- it is so unfair .

i mean , you covered that attending &apos;s ass ,
and you got-- you got crapped on every step of the way .
it-- the chief should know that .
oh , april--

what you did today was so great .
you know , you don &apos;t deserve this . i just--
i wanted you to know that somebody knows that ,

you want to screw ? let &apos;s screw .
y- you don &apos;t ? then get out .
i &apos;m not gonna hold your virgin hand
and walk you through it , damn it . you &apos;re not a child .
i can &apos;t take care of you !

uh , i usually do a post @-@ op exam right now .
yeah . well , he &apos;s on a c @-@ 130
halfway across the country by this time .

he &apos;s being well taken care of .
you did a good job .
i can tell you that .
what are you still doing hanging around ?
well , i wanted to say thank you .
and that it , uh ...
was nice meeting you .
i &apos;d say the same ...
but you were never here .
welcome .
wine &apos;s on the table , beer &apos;s in the fridge .
fridge ?
and since you actually live here ,
i &apos;ll hand over the hosting duties to you .
where &apos;s cristina ?
haven &apos;t seen her , which is sort of rude .
torres might know . hang on .
callie , yang say where she was--
oh , um ...
can i move in with you ?
that might be the rebound talking .
not like that . not that .
just until i can get rid of the subletter in my place .
i &apos;m starting from scratch , and i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t want to do it alone .
can &apos;t we be alone together ?
isn &apos;t it easier to be single in pairs ?
this a riddle ?
no . i &apos;m drunk .
come on . can i ?
sure .
yay .
your hair ... is hot .
right ?
oh , hi . hey .
um , uh , i &apos;m sorry . i- i didn &apos;t--
i know i should bring a gift , like a @-@ a housewarming gift ,
to things like this , but i didn &apos;t ...
i didn &apos;t really have time to bring anything .
so i &apos;m just really sorry .
it is really-- it &apos;s no problem .
what happened ? april ?
hey , hey . come on . come on .
come on .
has anybody seen cristina ?
if you &apos;re asking my opinion ,
i think you should .
i think you absolutely have to .
you should keep ...
and refinish the original floors .
why do i have to ?
i mean , like , i mean , you guys did what ,
like bamboo or something ?
we &apos;re building our house from scratch .
we can put down whatever we want .
you have original oak floors .
what if i don &apos;t like it ?
i mean , what if-- what if i hate oak ?
it doesn &apos;t matter . you have to do it .
the building &apos;s historic .
ugh . i know .
god . okay .
okay , but i mean ...
okay .
every pressurized system needs a relief valve ...
there has to be a way to reduce the stress ,
the tension ...
i got there as fast as i could .
it was a grade @-@ c fistula with a ruptured splenic artery .
you did everything you could . avery , too .
why don &apos;t you go home ?
yes , sir .
bailey , look--
why do we see so many post @-@ op fistulas
after pancreas surgeries ?
i mean , your operation is flawless . it doesn &apos;t matter .
we still we fistulas in , what , 20 % of patients .
i think ... there &apos;s a way to bring that number down .
i just gotta find it .
miranda--
i needed a win , sir .
i- i &apos;ve got a string of big losses ,
and ... i could use a win .
that &apos;s all .
yang ...
yang was the one i didn &apos;t have to worry about .
i know .
i know .
before it becomes too much to bear ......
look into the pancreatectomy patients .
figure it out ,
and then let me know how i can help .
uh , can i use avery ?
he actually gave me the idea . he was great today .
well , that &apos;s good to know .
you know alex karev saved a baby &apos;s life
with a ping @-@ pong ball ?
a ping @-@ pong ball ?
yes , he did .
alex karev .
there has to be a way to find relief ...
because if the pressure doesn &apos;t find a way out ...
it &apos;ll make one .
oh , listen . let me talk to her .
all right .
come here . come on .
here . come on .
it will explode .
okay , okay .
okay , okay . let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go . outside .
it &apos;s the pressure we put on ourselves
that &apos;s the hardest to bear ...
you think it was hard for yang ...
to quit , to ... to just walk away ?
oh , don &apos;t be stupid . you &apos;re not quitting .
besides , you might have just gotten yourself fired
or arrested , probably both .
yeah , well ,
april is the only friend i have left here , so ...
don &apos;t be stupid .
the pressure to be better than we are ...
what the hell were you thinking ?
she &apos;s a virgin . why would you do that ?
i know .
i know . god-- ow ! ow .
i mean , if you needed it that bad , alex ,
you should &apos;ve gone back to vegas .
there &apos;s a whole industry there .
i didn &apos;t go to vegas . i went to iowa .
you went to iowa .
i went home .
my brother-- remember aaron ?
yeah .
the doctors said ...
he got diagnosed schizophrenic ,
just like my mom .
you know how they figured it out ?
he tried to kill our little sister .
she &apos;s 16 , she &apos;s a kid ,
and her brother tried to kill her .
and my mom didn &apos;t do anything
&apos;cause she &apos;s off her meds , and ...
anyway , i was in iowa .
that &apos;s where i went ,
to my brother &apos;s commitment hearing .
i had to commit him . whatever .
the pressure to be better than we think we can be ...
well , it &apos;s good that you were there .
i wasn &apos;t there . i wasn &apos;t .
i showed up ,
i held my sister &apos;s hand in the hospital
for , like , ten minutes ,
i shoved some pills down my mom &apos;s throat ,
i signed my brother into a nuthouse ...
and i got the hell outta there as fast as i could .
i wasn &apos;t there .
i &apos;m the ass who can &apos;t stand to be there .
it never ...
ever lets up .
i should go down there .
ugh . i have to go down there .
yeah .
i should go .
you good ?
anything else you want to talk about ?
oh , bathroom tile .
it just builds and builds and builds .
