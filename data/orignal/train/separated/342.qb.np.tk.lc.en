max , what &apos;s a five @-@ letter word for &quot; happy &quot; ?
and it &apos;s not my first wife , helen .
i was gonna suggest &quot; drunk . &quot;
maybe &apos; cause i am .
hey , everybody !
guess what i have under my coat .
and it &apos;s not ice cream sundaes like last time .
it &apos;s my baby bump !
aw , sophie , you &apos;re showing !
and this time , it &apos;s not either of your nipples .
ah , look ! only four months .
and i &apos;m already approaching kardashian .
and that &apos;s quoting the doctor .
impressive .
you may have a north , south , east , and west in there .
而他们第一个孩子的名字叫north北
the baby really kicks .
so it &apos;s either gonna be a soccer player
or a los angeles policeman .
hey , han , what do you think
of my baby bump , baby bump , baby bump ?
in my country , we never comment on two things :
women &apos;s pregnancies or kim jong @-@ un &apos;s haircut .
one tuna malt .
that was a tuna melt .
max , here comes han .
now remember , we have to be extra nice
so we can get his support for our new dessert bar .
how can he support us ?
he can barely support his giant head .
see , that &apos;s the kind of stuff
you &apos;re gonna have to stay away from .
what &apos;s this about ?
last time you were smiling ,
i almost lost an ear .
well , my hollywood money has finally arrived ,
and as you know , han , max and i want to
convert the cupcake window into a dessert bar .
and as you know , i want to convert you two into waitresses .
come on , han , it won &apos;t affect the diner at all .
all we want to do is use the dish room--
home of two of the three original strands of e. coli .
it &apos;s a no .
my therapist said this had to be the year
of standing up for myself and cutting out soda .
all right , well go ahead , stand up .
but because i would like to see you make someone else miserable ,
i know a real estate agent
that could help you two find a new space .
did you say &quot; real estate asian &quot; ?
her name is evie , and i know her from my church .
and let &apos;s just say she &apos;s been angling
for what i &apos;ve got dangling .
your keys ?
she likes me , you shrews !
okay , well that &apos;s what we get for being nice .
so back to the dessert bar ,
did you get the pictures i sent you of those cool stools ?
i saw the subject heading was &quot; cool stools , &quot;
and i thought you finally shattered our last boundary .
here , give me your phone .
i can &apos;t find the stools .
oh , my god !
i can &apos;t believe what i &apos;m seeing .
is it that dog driving ?
no , why do you still have a picture
of your ex @-@ boyfriend on your phone ?
you swiped on my phone ?
what if i had something embarrassing in there ?
like a tasteful hoo @-@ ha shot ?
why do you still have a picture of randy on your phone ?
the guy who broke up with you in l.a. using a therapist ?
this bespeaks of an unresolved longing .
be @-@ stop be @-@ talking right now .
i am gonna delete them , i just haven &apos;t gotten around to it yet .
like being nice to people .
oh , my god , this is too weird .
what ?
it &apos;s randy .
does max work here ?
this smells like the place she described .
that smell &apos;s how i find my way to work every day .
what is he doing here ? i don &apos;t want to see him .
then don &apos;t turn around , &apos; cause he &apos;s right behind you .
max ?
good to see you .
you &apos;re not gonna turn around ?
no , i &apos;m good .
you &apos;re not gonna turn around for that guy ?
i mean , i would turn around for that guy .
see on the board you have some specials .
i guess i &apos;ll have the sloppy ... job ?
it &apos;s &quot; joe . &quot;
sometimes my &quot; e &quot; s look like &quot; b &quot; s .
clearly , i need to start writing the specials on the board .
you know what , just give me the meat ... load ?
that one , sadly , is spelled right .
randy , what are you doing here ?
lawyer stuff . i &apos;m in town for the weekend .
my client , tony bennett , is suing lady gaga
for making him uncool .
and i thought i &apos;d come by and see if max wanted to see me .
i guess i also wouldn &apos;t mind a cup of hot caca .
max ... you &apos;re not gonna turn around ?
okay . guess i better go .
well , bye .
bye .
damn it !
fell for the ol &apos; scooby doo fake footsteps .
how are you ?
i &apos;m great .
never been greater .
max , i need someone to clean up
the baby @-@ changing station in the ladies &apos; room .
we don &apos;t have one .
we do now .
i guess i better let you get back to work .
if you want to see me , give me a call .
tony has dinner and goes to bed around 3 : 30 .
randy thinks he can just show up with his face
and his body and his muscular @-@ but @-@ not @-@ too @-@ thick neck
and think i &apos;m gonna forget that he dumped me ?
max , don &apos;t say &quot; dumped . &quot;
say &quot; kicked to the curb . &quot; it &apos;s kinder .
oh , max , we have an unattended package situation .
not unlike that homeless guy we just passed on the stoop .
wow , that &apos;s the biggest box i &apos;ve seen
since i accidentally clicked on a &quot; big , beautiful women &quot; porn .
it stops being an &quot; accident &quot;
when you wake me up by yelling ,
&quot; hey , check out this &apos; big , beautiful women &apos; porn ! &quot;
well , this is exciting .
i haven &apos;t had a surprise delivery
since that baby i felt was just chipolte .
chipolte .
max , that never really happened , right ?
whatever makes you sleep sounder , sweetheart .
never happened .
oh , good god ! it &apos;s three kinds of popcorn !
and all kinds of disappointment .
crazy ?
you &apos;ve got your standard butter ,
you got your sweet , sweet caramel ,
and finally , the popcorn that needs no introduction ,
cheese !
cheese @-@ us , that &apos;s good .
it &apos;s from randy .
&quot; i know it &apos;s corny , but i miss you .
love , randy . &quot;
oh , great , so he &apos;s a great writer too ?
why am i mad at him again ?
all right , he obviously knows your sweet spot
is the grocery aisle at rite aid ,
but i am not gonna let junk food cloud your judgment again .
like that time you donated blood for a chocolate chip cookie .
hey , i also got orange juice .
hey , girls .
max , this was delivered upstairs for you .
uh , sorry about the bite marks ,
but the baby a whiff of the pimento loaf and said ,
&quot; oh , i just got to have it . &quot;
&quot; i know i was a jerky ,
so let me say sorry with salami . &quot;
what , does randy have , like , a team of writers
working on these things ?
randy ?
you mean that hot guy with the muscular neck ?
muscular , but not too thick .
yeah !
he &apos;s trying to win you back with salamis
and delicious biscotti ?
there &apos;s no biscotti in here .
oh , yeah , well ...
the baby needed something sweet .
oh , my gosh .
the baby just kicked .
oh , that brings me so much joy .
it did it again !
my gosh .
hey , i think it &apos;s following the salami !
thank you so much for showing us the space today , evie .
i &apos;m sure max will be here any minute .
it &apos;s hard for her to be on time .
or sober for more than an hour .
well , the pros are the location and the price .
and the cons are the 11 people i &apos;m guessing have died in here .
it is a little small , but people like small .
i know i do .
and i know i am very curious about the natural light in here .
and i can make anything pretty .
just ask suda mahmoosh from high school .
everyone called her bert
till i worked my tweezer magic .
well , you have to act now , because there are three other
very attractive offers on the table .
and one wants to take me on a cruise .
what did i tell you ?
she &apos;s undressing me with her eyes .
well , i &apos;m buttoning you back up with mine .
oh , i have to take this .
and han ?
나 를 하자
what did she say to you in korean ?
&apos;cause she was coming at you hard .
that she wants me to come at her hard .
well , what &apos;s the problem , han ?
i mean , she &apos;s cute and she likes you ,
and it &apos;s not your job to ask why .
that &apos;s mine and max &apos;s .
the problem is that she &apos;s from a very conservative family ,
and she wants to be a virgin when she gets married .
a two @-@ virgin marriage .
that &apos;s cute .
or is it too matchy @-@ matchy ?
no , no , she wants to have sex before marriage .
i &apos;m confused-- she wants be a virgin ,
but she wants to have sex ?
like an &quot; everything but &quot; situation .
so to speak .
she &apos;s found a loophole , and it rhymes with loophole .
what ?
below the waist , she &apos;s like a mullet--
business in the front , party in the back .
still nothing ?
yeah , i got it !
i just don &apos;t want to talk about it .
this is a conversation you need to have with a man .
and when max gets here ,
i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll make fun of you
and then tell you what to do .
i &apos;m sorry , caroline . the space just got rented .
spaces don &apos;t stay empty for long around here .
han , can you walk me to my car ?
i need help putting something in my trunk .
i &apos;m right behind you !
i mean ...
where are mickey and minnie mouse going ?
max , where were you ?
you &apos;re late , we lost the space ,
and i had to learn that our real estate agent
wants to have sex with han , but remain a ...
front virgin .
please understand me .
oh , she &apos;s working the ol &apos; loophole argument ?
what , you never heard of that ?
the girls at st. bridget &apos;s invented it .
按理婚前应保持 &quot; 处子之身 &quot;
i can &apos;t take any more of this !
that &apos;s what they said !
but then they did .
shouldn &apos;t you be coming in through the back door ?
i got to say , max , i &apos;m really surprised
you didn &apos;t cave in and see randy .
you &apos;re showing more backbone than a supermodel .
yup , i &apos;m not gonna see randy !
i &apos;m not seeing randy at all !
okay , and they say i &apos;m the loud one .
get out of here , caroline !
who i am talking to .
uh , can you go outside
and bring me something from outside ?
like what ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
a souvenir from coney island .
an old woman &apos;s hat from manhattan .
okay , sure . outside stuff , got it .
thanks . take your time .
what are you still doing here ?
you said you were just gonna take as shower and leave .
i was waiting for the water to get hot .
took four hours !
you have to go before caroline gets back .
wow , i haven &apos;t snuck out of an apartment
since i helped my friend escape scientology .
well , she &apos;s back . and you two are busted .
i knew he was in here .
i saw his 12 @-@ pack in my phone
when i was taking a couch selfie .
and you let him use my towel ?
it &apos;s also my sheet / dress for summer weddings .
okay , you know what ?
i &apos;m gonna get out of your dress
and give you two a minute .
i can &apos;t believe you had sex with randy .
more than just sex !
stay out of this !
you said you were gonna mull it over .
weigh the pros and cons .
you know , before you came here ,
i used to date pros and cons .
i &apos;m not used to thinking about stuff
and making sound judgments .
i just found out last year there are instructions on medicine .
well , i &apos;m sorry if i want what &apos;s best for you .
just throwing this out there--
got a great job , nice house ,
please , this is between me and max .
we have to figure out what to do about you two .
well , i @-@ i like him , but i don &apos;t want to get hurt again .
see ? those are pros and cons .
this is exciting .
what &apos;s going on out there ?
&apos;cause it kind of sounds like i &apos;m on trial .
you know what ? this is a big decision .
maybe we should all just sleep on it .
isn &apos;t sleeping on it what got me in trouble in the first place ?
i thought of another pro for randy .
he looks like a man from the front and from the back .
very rare in these times .
okay , i &apos;ll put it on the list .
oh , no , this is my list of reasons to stay alive .
you should know i &apos;m down to one .
evie found a small place in brooklyn she wants you to see .
as for the small place she wants me to see ,
i haven &apos;t decided .
caroline , let &apos;s get some pros and cons going
for han taking the a @-@ train .
i mean , this is the closest to a vagina
that any of us ever thought you &apos;d be .
so if i decide to pass ,
you won &apos;t think less of me ?
han , that would be impossible .
hey , everybody .
you know , you get a seat on the subway if you &apos;re pregnant
and willing to sit on an old person &apos;s lap .
sophie , what &apos;s a seven @-@ letter word for--oh , hell .
three years is too long to spend on one crossword .
according to my mom ,
it &apos;s too long to spend in third grade too .
carol , come to my booth .
i think my baby &apos;s gonna kick again .
uh , sophie , we &apos;re kind of working .
oh , you got a job ?
hey , there .
i &apos;m , uh , here for max .
oh , and 14 across ?
papaya .
damn ! i &apos;m back in !
randy , we actually haven &apos;t come to a decision yet .
well , i want my day in court .
oh , you could have mine . it &apos;s the third .
as you know , i &apos;m a lawyer .
and i usually don &apos;t practice in a courtroom
that serves something called pork chip .
but if i &apos;m gonna be on trial here ,
i &apos;m gonna make my case .
okay , but let me just say--
do you want the list of pros and cons ?
i got this .
i need to make sure that i can trust you
with my best friend &apos;s heart again .
oh , my god , that was pure good wife .
max , go have a seat in sophie &apos;s booth .
that &apos;s fine , but i &apos;m getting some of that pork chip .
it &apos;s good , baby .
it comes with a side of ass potatoes .
randy .
you live in l.a. max lives in new york .
did you or did you not say you &apos;re bad
at long @-@ distance relationships ?
i did .
and did you or did you not say
that you &apos;re just in town for the weekend ?
well , i did say that--
ma &apos;am , do you or do you not see me
conducting a mock trial up in here ?
randy , did you or did you not
break up with max using a therapist because ...
you couldn &apos;t do it yourself ?
well , i--
answer the question !
yes .
caroline , girl , you are good .
where were you when i got arrested
for being black in tacoma ?
you &apos;re living in l.a. , max is living in new york ,
and you &apos;re both living in denial
if you think a relationship can work .
may i approach the booth and mount my defense ?
you mounted the defense three times yesterday .
objection ! kissing the witness !
what the hell is going on out here ?
they are putting that white billy dee williams on trial .
you &apos;re right , i did hurt her .
breaking up with her using a therapist was a bad decision .
breaking up with her at all was a bad decision .
and why should she trust me if i &apos;m just gonna
blow into town for the weekend and leave ?
well , for a lawyer ,
you &apos;re not making a great case for yourself .
yeah .
i mean , if i were you ,
i &apos;d just take my shirt off right now .
and the truth is ...
i &apos;m not here on business .
tony bennett isn &apos;t suing lady gaga .
although he should . i &apos;m just not involved .
i came to new york for the weekend
to see max .
and she &apos;s the reason i &apos;m gonna stay
in new york for a month
to see if we can make this work .
i think that should count as two pros .
you &apos;re really gonna stay here for me ?
i couldn &apos;t stop thinking about you .
i didn &apos;t even delete your photos off my phone .
well , that &apos;s pathetic .
so i think i found the perfect space for your dessert bar .
it &apos;s got to be better than the other holes you showed us .
well , it &apos;s in the trendiest part of williamsburg ,
cheap , and the landlord is a really nice guy .
it &apos;s so close to the diner .
won &apos;t it be weird if we run into han ?
and not with a car ?
okay . this is it .
hello !
oh , no , i hate puppet shows .
evie , this isn &apos;t available , it &apos;s a cupcake shop .
unless those two girls finally gave up .
i &apos;ve decided to let you expand .
evie convinced me to do things outside my comfort zone .
yes , i did .
how &apos; bout that , caroline ?
we &apos;re not the only ones she showed a dingy , dark hole to .
get your minds out of the gutter .
she took me to hot yoga .
he vomited two &quot; oms &quot; in .
but at least he tried .
so who knows what &apos;s next ?
well , i &apos;ve never had lobster .
han , are you sure about this ?
you &apos;ll let us build our dessert bar here ?
i &apos;m sure i &apos;ll regret it almost immediately .
han , i would hug you right now ,
but the cons outweigh the pros .
this is gonna be the coolest bar !
we just have to get rid of that .
