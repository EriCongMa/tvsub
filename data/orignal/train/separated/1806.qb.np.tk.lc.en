we need four units of o @-@ neg .
bring that bench over here .
they went to cut off the door ,
and all i could think was he &apos;s gonna bleed out .
we need more time .
i was pissed , but then i thought ,
&quot; no , we need less distance to the o.r. , so --
so , you brought -- the whole damn car .
how is he ?
he &apos;s hanging on , barely .
i remember in school someone telling me
i came from a broken home .
that &apos;s what they used to call it
when your parents got divorced .
this isn &apos;t the way we usually do that .
i had to do it this way .
no , no , no , we see why you did it .
okay . look , i just wanted to give him --
a second chance .
we got a second chance .
... even though getting divorced
was the least broken thing they ever did .
hey , keith , it &apos;s meredith .
thanks for having me over .
how &apos;s joan ?
what &apos;s the word on my baby ?
we &apos;ll find out for you . we got you .
when i heard that as a kid ,
i wondered if broken homes were
where the broken people lived .
still feeling those toes , joan ?
yeah .
good .
um , you guys , let &apos;s just stop .
let &apos;s stop for a sec .
what &apos;s happening ?
there &apos;s just a little bleeding ,
which is normal after a delivery ,
but we &apos;re gonna get you checked out
before you have your spinal surgery , okay ?
it was silly . i mean , i was just a little kid .
gonna take her .
no , no , what are you doing ?
what are you doing with my baby ?
just for a while .
no , please ! we were crushed in a car !
my fiance &apos;s dead ! you &apos;re not taking my baby !
please no !
joan , your baby &apos;s doing fine , okay ?
please !
we just need to check you out .
okay , you need to take him to the nicu and page karev .
but to this day , i still wonder .
no !
it looks like uterine atony . we need to move fast .
we move fast , we paralyze her .
we move too slow and she bleeds to death .
okay .
yeah , i already spoke to mom .
amelia .
i don &apos;t know how fast you &apos;re moving on the house .
i haven &apos;t even accepted an offer yet , so --
i can have my stuff out next week . is that soon enough ?
ted , i don &apos;t care whose side of the story .
i &apos;m not sure i can make it any sooner .
you don &apos;t have to .
i should &apos;ve been out a while ago .
derek is the one who invited me , and he &apos;s gone , so --
i -- yes , i am listening .
dad ...
i have to go .
is alex in the nicu ?
don &apos;t know and don &apos;t care , &apos; cause apparently ,
he thinks i &apos;m some sort of &apos; 50s housewife
who he can tell where to be and what to do
and when to bake a pot roast .
i &apos;m holding a baby .
who &apos;s this ?
come on , here .
there &apos;s been a lot of talking ,
but not a lot of getting me out of the car .
that &apos;s still the plan , right -- get keith out of the car ?
that &apos;s the plan .
when joanie called and told me she was pregnant ,
you know what my first thought was ?
run like hell .
we &apos;d only had the one date .
and she agrees , it kind of sucked .
i think we had sex just to stop the awkward silence .
and then boom -- insta @-@ family , like sea monkeys .
it was scary .
now i can &apos;t believe i ever felt like that .
now all i want to do is see them .
grey , we &apos;re ready to cut the roof .
okay , keith ,
it &apos;s gonna get real loud and then it &apos;s gonna get scary ,
and then we &apos;re gonna get you out , okay ?
loud , scary , free .
okay .
okay .
arizona &apos;s having trouble
controlling the post @-@ partum hemorrhage .
this just keeps getting--
edwards .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m scrubbing in .
no , you &apos;re not .
i gave you one job -- to keep her in the collar
until trauma cleared her .
it was the interns who --
and you left her in the care of first @-@ day interns .
they should &apos;ve known better .
no , you should &apos;ve known better . you can go now .
you are no longer going anywhere near this patient , got it ?
go .
roof coming off ! okay , guys , you &apos;re clear .
we need a trauma panel and type and cross for eight .
got it . drawing labs .
no blood in the pericardium .
penetrating thoraco @-@ abdominal injury .
ultrasound , please .
keith , talk to me . how do you feel ?
uh ... popular .
funny . that &apos;s funny .
okay , guys , when you clear , we &apos;re gonna cut away
the piece of the door here that &apos;s impaling him ,
then you can get him inside , okay ?
all right .
dr. grey .
i have an update on his fiancee .
april certainly thought outside the box .
i like this kepner .
i never thought i would like kepner .
you know , old kepner was --
there was pigtails and bunny rabbits and smiling .
lots of smiling ,
but kepner the reboot , kepner 2.0 , she &apos;s crazy !
she &apos;s fierce .
she &apos;s womaned up .
thank you , united states army .
bailey , hunt has this .
i need you to handle everything else in the e.r.
you are in charge .
get used to it .
yes , sir !
i thought i made myself perfectly clear .
you can &apos;t just appoint a new chief .
there are rules and recommendations to be made ,
and then the board votes .
just because something &apos;s been done one way forever
doesn &apos;t mean it shouldn &apos;t change .
it &apos;s called evolution .
no .
what you &apos;re talking about is called dictatorship ,
and i did not sign up for a dictatorship , catherine avery .
no one asked you to , richard webber .
that &apos;s the problem -- you never ask , you only tell .
well , let me tell you how this is gonna --
look , i don &apos;t want to listen to another word about it !
let &apos;s get back to it !
excuse me .
i @-@ i can &apos;t . i &apos;m ...
hey , keith . stay with me .
i have some news for you .
joan &apos;s okay .
she &apos;s headed into surgery , and you have a baby boy .
a ... boy ?
a boy ?
i have a son .
okay , joan , i &apos;m gonna put you out now , okay ?
uterus is flaccid . she &apos;s hemorrhaging .
okay , we got to put her under .
you got to get this under control now .
i know that .
i need a balloon catheter .
is she out ?
not yet , why ?
joan , keith is here .
he &apos;s here . he &apos;s alive .
keith &apos;s here ?
they &apos;re working on him now .
wilson , go .
pressure &apos;s at 70 . we &apos;re losing her .
keith , hang in there . hang in there .
okay , stop !
hey , stop ! stop ! stop ! okay , hold up .
what is it , grey ?
we can &apos;t do this . not like this .
it &apos;s gonna tear him apart .
we &apos;re gonna open him up out here ?
it &apos;s the only way . we start an ex @-@ lap .
clamp everything we can .
it &apos;ll buy us time till we get him upstairs .
only five or six minutes till he bleeds out .
that &apos;s plenty of time .
guys , guys , all o.r.s are full .
all of them ?
tunnel collapse victims .
no , no , we have a plastics o.r. available .
that &apos;s all the way at the other end of the building .
that &apos;s impossible .
nothing &apos;s impossible .
we just -- all right ,
we clear a path to the east elevator .
move everything out of the way ,
stop all foot traffic , lock down the elevator .
can he make it that far ?
no , but he will .
he doesn &apos;t have a choice , right ?
so , we run .
all out like olympians .
it &apos;s plenty of time . it &apos;s plenty of time .
let &apos;s prep him for an ex @-@ lap out here .
okay .
okay .
i am not crying wolf .
sir ?
i do not make decisions lightly , and i don &apos;t bow to dictators .
miranda bailey , you will be
grey sloan memorial &apos;s next chief of surgery !
congratulations !
thank you .
catheter is working , and the bleeding has stopped .
no tear in the dura , amazingly .
so , an intern opened her collar ?
oh , stupid .
wait , was that the intern that we thought was an attending ?
you mistook an intern for an attending ?
yeah , he was pretty much running the trauma .
like a boss . like a hot , hot boss .
somebody should get into that .
maybe you should get into that .
you know what ? you should get into that .
i don &apos;t think so .
i have started a strict no workplace dating policy .
i hear you .
it &apos;s all too ... you know ?
they see you , all of you .
then they come to work and they see you here , too ,
and you try to keep it professional
and get things done , but suddenly you &apos;re thinking ,
&quot; i was naked on you before . &quot;
or &quot; i wish you were naked now . &quot;
&quot; hey , remember when you were there at my very rock bottom
and i went down the rabbit hole and dragged you in with me
and bared the darkest parts
of my soul to you in the midnight hours ?
so , now let &apos;s have a budget meeting . &quot;
it &apos;s a solid policy .
trust me .
i can &apos;t find the 8 e.t. tubes .
yeah , but i need more .
webber is making me chief of surgery .
that &apos;s great , but i got to get these -- wait , what ?
chief ?
wait , chief of surgery ?
ooh , say it again .
hey , how you doing , man ?
this is my wife , dr. miranda bailey ,
chief of surgery .
no , chief of all these damn surgeries .
oh , i got to get these , uh , in .
oh , yeah , go , go , go .
who is the chief ?
i am the chief .
warren , you &apos;ll intubate .
kepner , you and i will do the ex @-@ lap .
get control of whatever &apos;s bleeding .
grey , i need you and pierce scrubbed and ready
in the o.r. when we get there , we got it ?
okay .
meredith , do me a favor .
tell joanie that i loved her and that i --
no . no , no , no .
no messages from beyond the grave , keith .
we &apos;re not doing that .
it &apos;s okay .
you guys have been great .
you went way above and beyond .
keith , yes , a lot of people here
are working very hard to pull this off ,
and you have to work , too , okay ?
i &apos;ve seen the looks on these people &apos;s faces .
this is not gonna work .
hunt , i &apos;m gonna need a minute .
okay .
i &apos;m serious -- one minute , that &apos;s all i &apos;m allowing .
it &apos;s too soon .
fine , fine .
you talk to wilson yet about me and the kids moving in ?
no . i was a jackass , and now she &apos;s not even talking to me .
i can &apos;t even -- - is she moving out ?
is there room for amelia ,
because you could take your old room ,
i could take my old room back ,
and then amelia could move into cristina &apos;s room .
god , mer , what the hell ?
i know , i know ,
but i hurt her feelings , and she &apos;s mad at me .
i forgot i &apos;m supposed to be her sister .
you &apos;re a complete tool sometimes .
i &apos;ve heard .
all right , everybody stop what you &apos;re doing .
quiet , please . make a hole . make a hole .
let them through , guys .
i have something for you .
hey , big man .
look at you .
i &apos;m sorry for all this crap .
sorry , i just ... wish i ...
i &apos;m gonna see you when i get out of here , okay ?
you and your mom , yeah ?
i &apos;m gonna be there and we &apos;re gonna be together , okay ?
oh , i love you . daddy loves you .
kiss .
okay , okay .
all right , let &apos;s bag him .
push 200 of ketamine .
don &apos;t go .
no .
i &apos;m right here .
that was a bad idea bringing him out here like that .
why ?
because i &apos;m gonna be really pissed ...
if you don &apos;t pull this off .
me too .
that was a really nice idea .
oh , well , it wasn &apos;t mine , but i &apos;ll take credit .
look , i was being a jerk .
shut up .
i know . we were both jerks .
can we just move on ?
please .
good .
so , i have to ask you something .
okay .
meredith asked me if she could move in .

what do you think ?
with the kids ?
no , she &apos;s selling the kids with the house .
yes , with the kids .

we estimate we have less than three minutes
to get him from car to o.r.
any more than that , he dies .

i might .
i really want this to work .

right . right .
what did you think i meant ?
oh , nothing , no .

jo !
jo , come here .
the sad widow is my friend -- my best friend .
and i @-@ i don &apos;t want to piss you off
and i don &apos;t want you running off somewhere ,
but i @-@ i can &apos;t say no to her .
so , you &apos;re saying no to me . okay .
no .
look , all that crap i said about building a life here
and about putting down roots -- look , i meant with you .
i want a house with you , my career with you .
uh , maybe someday a dog , maybe .
it &apos;s all supposed to be with you .
i th-- i thought you got that .
i didn &apos;t think i needed to say it .
so , when i say that i can &apos;t say no to my friend ,
it doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m saying no to you .
i want you and all of it with you .
okay .
where are you going ?
i just ...
i have to think about what i want .
vitals are steady .
we may actually pull this out .
this will make a hell of a wedding story .
hey , what is going on with your mom and richard ?
ah , same old crap .
clash of the titans .
what ?
they both want to be boss .
both want to dig in ,
and my mom is the smartest person in the room .
she &apos;s used to it .
she &apos;s used to everybody knowing
that she &apos;s the smartest person in the room .
so , when you challenge her , it &apos;s world war iii .
and richard is the same .
well , that is just ridiculous and pathetic .
i mean , you don &apos;t just shrug your shoulders and call it quits .
you find a way to work through it .
you don &apos;t just ...
give up and throw it all away like it was nothing .
oh , oh . wow . uh , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s something else . she doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
don &apos;t look at me . ignore me .
welcome to the family .
thank you , doctor .
i have something for you . thank you .
it &apos;s my old cellphone .
there &apos;s one voicemail on it .
password is 1515 .
and make sure you &apos;re alone when you listen to it .
who does the post @-@ anesthesia checks ?
shut up .
isn &apos;t rounds when we &apos;re supposed to ask questions ?
i thought you weren &apos;t allowed to go near that patient .
did i not just say shut up ?
hi , joan .
it &apos;s dr. edwards .
give my hands a squeeze ?
they fixed me up .
can you squeeze a little harder for me on your right ?
i am as hard as i can .
i can &apos;t really breathe .
her sats are dropping pretty fast .
what &apos;s happening ?
shaw , bag her .
get a crash cart and an intubation tray in here now .
don &apos;t take that off . i did that . you don &apos;t want to -- oh .
she &apos;s hemorrhaging . blood &apos;s compressing her trachea .
gloves ! gloves !
she &apos;s losing her airway .
scalpel .
page shepherd and torres .
betadine .
scalpel now .
sats back up to 93 , 95 .
what happened ?
looks like a leaking carotid pseudoaneurysm .
what about her right side ?
will she get her motor function back ?
i &apos;m more worried about brain death at this point .
she can easily throw a clot
and have a massive hemispheric stroke .
well , it &apos;s a good thing that you caught it .
no , edwards . edwards did .
dr. edwards , is there any chance
the leak could cause permanent da--
will you hush ?
just sit back there and stay silent .
edwards !
what ?
these are your ducklings .
i &apos;m sor-- what ?
today is the first day of your new job ,
and you have failed gloriously .
you are a teacher . now , these interns are yours .
they &apos;re your ducklings , and you &apos;re letting them drown !
well , i want them to drown .
i want to watch it .
well , you can &apos;t .
you have to teach them how to paddle their stupid feet
and stay above the water .
they &apos;re going to screw up .
and it will never be their fault .
it will always be your fault .
but how you teach them will determine
how they treat patients for years to come .
they &apos;re your web @-@ footed legacy ,
and they &apos;re brilliant students .
hand @-@ selected for this program by doctors wiser than you ,
and they &apos;re your responsibility .
raise your ducklings .
what is the matter with you two ?
my husband is dead .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna play that card .
you .
you walked away from ellis , never got to be with her ,
and now she &apos;s dead .
adele is dead .
and you -- i don &apos;t know who &apos;s dead for you .
but the both of you are very , very much alive
and breathing and driving each other crazy .
and you yell and argue and fight ,
and you both should be thrilled to be able to do those things .
i would give anything to be able to do those things .
and none of those things are reason enough
to not be with the person that you love ,
especially when there just isn &apos;t enough .
there will never be enough time .
and you both know that .
so whatever it is that that &apos;s coming between you two ,
will you just please figure it out ?
figure it out .
it &apos;s amazing anyone survived this .
you should be proud of yourself .
it was a little ballsy , huh ?
it was , actually , and you loved it .
and i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re upset .
because i need to say something ,
and i don &apos;t know how to say it .
i don &apos;t even want to say it .
you want to go back .
there &apos;s another plane going to jordan in a couple weeks ,
and you ...
and you want to be on it .
the way i felt today ,
every day is like it out there .
i thought it was just readjustment ,
and then i thought it was , like ,
an adrenaline addiction or something ,
but it feels like ...
i don &apos;t know , i --
i feel like i &apos;ve been called , jackson .
well , maybe you should go back .
really ?
when we lost samuel ,
a light went out in you , and i miss it .
i miss it so much .
and whatever it was over there ,
you know , whatever it is , it got relit .
thank you .
wait . wait .
april , i love you so much .
but i don &apos;t think i can be here when you come back .
you understand ?
what ?
what ? why ?
no .
it &apos;s only gonna be a couple of months .
it &apos;s not gonna be a year .
no .
i @-@ i promise i &apos;ll d--
no .
you don &apos;t know what i &apos;ve been through this last year .
this last year , what it was like ...
i -- i know .
i -- it was -- it was hard . - i know .
what do you mean you know ? you don &apos;t know .
you never asked .
not once , in fact .
how was i doing ?
how was i coping ?
you didn &apos;t even ask .
i &apos;m sorry .
s-- god , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
you know -- but we talked .
yeah , you know what ? and --
you &apos;ve got to have your life @-@ altering journey , okay ?
and i stayed behind .
and i held stuff down .
and i silenced myself so that you could grieve .
if you need to grieve , we can --
i did ! i did need to grieve .
i needed to -- needed to with you .
that &apos;s what marriage is to me , april .
so , um ...
okay , so you &apos;re saying that if i go --
if i go again , then we &apos;re done ?
you &apos;re just calling it ?
squeeze my fingers .
good .
very good .
my baby -- is my baby okay ?
he &apos;s doing just fine .
and keith ? is he ...
i &apos;m right here .
you &apos;re here ?
i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m looking right at you .
i saw our baby .
he &apos;s beautiful . he &apos;s so beautiful .
he looks exactly like me .
don &apos;t make me laugh .
it hurts .
okay , but research budgets
are approved by one department head ,
not a committee .
agreed . next point .
i have a say in all the residency candidates .
rejected . never gonna happen .
i gave you valentine &apos;s day !
if i have to celebrate valentine &apos;s day ,
i get to review the prospective residents .
and give a recommendation .
nothing more .
i have final say .
that &apos;s fair .
next point .
miranda bailey is the next chief of surgery .
miranda bailey
is judged against an outside candidate of my choosing .
then the board votes based on merit .
that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s fair .
agreed . next point .
now ...
when we &apos;re at home , we are not at work .
we leave work at the hospital .
rejected . totally unrealistic .
richard , our schedules -- come on !
hey , i understand ,
but we need some time for each o--
the bedroom .
no work in the bedroom .
next point .
i will provide a safe harbor .
what does that mean ?
you need a place
to not be catherine avery ...
to not be decisive and set agendas
and rise to the level of accomplishments
that the world has come to expect of you .
you need a place to fall apart .
i will be that place ...
... should you require it ...
... in perpetuity .
richard , do you take catherine to be your wife
for as long as you both shall live ?
i do .
and , catherine ?
i do . i do , forever .
then by the power vested in me by the state of washington ,
i now pronounce you husband and wife .
hey , bottoms up , plastics pals--
let &apos;s just enjoy the party , huh ?
where &apos;s kepner ?
i don &apos;t know .
where have you been ?
come with me . i want to show you something .
oh , congratulations , chief !
thank you , thank you .
uh , and speaking of chief , um ...
i , uh , had a talk with catherine ,
and there is going to be , um ...
i don &apos;t know how to say this , but --
you have got to be kidding me .
you &apos;re running just against one other candidate ,
but you &apos;re gonna have it .
ju-- sir , i understand , but it &apos;s just not fair .
well , actually , it &apos;s the only fair way --
no , no , no -- to this other candidate ,
because i am going to wipe the floor with her ... or him .
it &apos;s gonna hurt .
getting trounced hurts ,
and it &apos;ll be embarrassing , publicly and professionally ,
losing by that wide a margin ,
because i am primed for this job , sir .
i deserve this job .
there isn &apos;t a single person in this room
who would d @-@ d--
disagree .
... disagree that i am not so ready for this job .

it &apos;s a loft space .
jo , it &apos;s a crime scene .
stop ! stop it . you &apos;re ruining it .
someone beat me to that .
oh , shut up !
it &apos;s all i can afford .
i took everything --
all my savings , everything that i had --
and it was almost enough to cover the whole thing .
wait . you &apos;re buying this ?
well , um ...
we are , if you want to pitch in .
i put in an offer .
sell meredith her house back ...
because this is what i want ...
our own place , for us .
and and , um , i just --
i saw this place ,
and i thought that we could make it anything ... ?
whatever we want ...
... because i love you .
and i love living with you .
but we should just ...
we should have our own place .
just us .
if you want that .
if that &apos;s -- if that &apos;s what you want , too .
you &apos;ve never said that .
said what ?
&quot; i love you . &quot;
i didn &apos;t think that i had to .
patient presented in labor with a fracture at c5 @-@ 6 .
radioulnar fracture was reduced in the field .
post @-@ op , she bled from a carotid pseudoaneurysm ...
... which was repaired with an arteriotomy and a patch .
patient now shows no neuro deficits

i was just about to listen to a message .
but i can &apos;t ...
seem to bring myself to hit play .
hey , it &apos;s me .
i &apos;m on the ferry .
i @-@ i just wanted to say that , um ...
... god , i wish you could see this .
weather &apos;s classic seattle .
oh , the water is so blue .
it may be the most perfect ferryboat ride
i &apos;ve ever had in my life .
we &apos;re gonna do this a lot more when i get home ,
by the way -- you , me , and the family .
we &apos;re just gonna take a day and ...
ride the ferryboat -- all day if we want .
i love you , meredith .
i know i just left , and i &apos;m not even at the airport yet ,
but i just wanted to say ...
i love you .
i love our family .
and we &apos;re gonna keep doing this .
i &apos;ll see you when i get home .
i love you .
you okay ?
yeah .

and don &apos;t say you &apos;re fine .
nothing . i &apos;m fine .
what -- did somebody die ?
my parents are getting a divorce .
my mom called and told me today .
she &apos;s been having an affair
with the man that services their cars ...
for 11 years .
he &apos;s been servicing their cars and my mom .
and my dad found out about it years ago , and he was enraged ,
and he stuck with it for me , because i was ...
i was still in town .
i was always around .
you know , so they held it together for the kid .
classic . except the kid &apos;s a grown woman .
they wanted to preserve my ...
happy , idyllic ...
... pathetic , crap @-@ filled lie of a childhood !
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i ...
your husband died ,
and i am crying like a 7 @-@ year @-@ old over mommy and daddy . i ...
i didn &apos;t grow up like you . i ...
i &apos;ve never lost anyone .
i never even had a cat die .
i still have all my grandparents .
there &apos;s no darkness in my life .
just , i &apos;ve never had it .
so i @-@ i &apos;m not gonna come talk to you about it .
well , you should always come talk to me ...
because whatever it is , chances are , i &apos;ve seen worse ,
and i am qualified to tell you how you &apos;ll survive .
you should always come and talk to me .
what are you crying about ?
what are you crying about ?
derek would have loved this .
he came from this big , noisy family .
i want this to be my last memory of this house .
that &apos;s what he wanted -- to fill it with noise and people .
you can build a house out of anything ,
make it as strong as you want .
okay . we have to dance it out .
what ?
what does that mean ?
let &apos;s go .
but a home ...
a home is more fragile than that .
a home is made of the people you fill it with .
and people can be broken . sure .
but any surgeon knows ...
... what &apos;s broken can be mended .
... what &apos;s hurt can be healed .
that no matter how dark it gets ...
... the sun &apos;s gonna rise again .
