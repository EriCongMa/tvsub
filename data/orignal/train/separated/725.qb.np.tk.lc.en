第四季 第二十二集
we &apos;ve got a body over here !
the coroner checked her dental records .
it &apos;s definitely victoria grayson .
my dearest margaux ,
i &apos;ve decided to end my life .
you have two days to clear my name .
your move , amanda .
i think someone broke in here and attacked victoria .
this wasn &apos;t a suicide at all .
this was murder .
what are you doing here ?
i was called back for questioning .
isn &apos;t this a conflict of interest ,
working on a case that involves your girlfriend ?
we broke up the night you left .
she ran to the airport to stop you . she chose you .
it &apos;s a form of lymphoma .
they got it early , and i &apos;m getting cutting @-@ edge treatment .
victoria asked me to pass along a message .
i &apos;m going to make it appear
as if you murdered me in your own home .
amanda clarke , you &apos;re under arrest
for the murder of victoria grayson .
victoria set me up .
cuff her .
jack , i didn &apos;t do it . she planned this !
i &apos;m innocent !
they &apos;re going for the brass ring ...
murder one , special circumstances ,
and they like their odds .
the state &apos;s going to argue that a week after you went on tv
and told the world how much you hate victoria grayson ,
you terrorized her in a parking garage ,
broke into her penthouse , attacked her ,
then you locked her in your own home ,
which you burned to the ground
in an attempt to make it look like she killed herself .
and this is her suicide note that i allegedly forged .
which they &apos;ll have you read aloud at trial .
but this is victoria &apos;s handwriting .
d.a. &apos; s experts found small discrepancies
which will prove it &apos;s a fake ,
and their argument will be that
you couldn &apos;t have accomplished half of what you did
as &quot; emily thorne &quot; without doing plenty of forging .
which is why say it again ...
at least let me try to negotiate a plea to lesser charges .
absolutely not .
if you &apos;re found guilty of murder one , it &apos;s life in prison .
second degree might have you out in ...
i &apos;m not pleading guilty to anything .
there &apos;s nothing to negotiate . just get me bailed out .
david .
hey .
how &apos;d it go ?
the chemo ? oh , day at the spa .
he &apos;s a trooper .
have you seen amanda yet ?
no , they haven &apos;t brought her out .
but i may have just tracked down our missing friend ...
victoria &apos;s partner in crime .
treadwell ?
mm @-@ hmm .
i &apos;ve been hijacking feeds from all over the web ,
mostly security cam footage ,
running it through facial recognition software .
when i narrowed it down to smug and traitorous ,
that &apos;s what came up .
that &apos;s mason . where is that ? is that a trailer park ?
hmm , that &apos;s a good eye .
about 11 of them in a 100 @-@ mile radius .
i &apos;m trying to narrow it down .
leave it to mason treadwell to take a limo to a trailer park .
all rise .
the honorable judge moss presiding .
ms. clarke , we &apos;re ready for you now .
court is now in session . you may be seated .
阿曼达 · 克拉克即将被提审
so you don &apos;t see the problem ? read it .
&quot; amanda clarke to be arraigned . &quot;
no , alleged killer amanda clarke to be arraigned .
put it in the style sheet .
from here on , every time we use her name ,
it &apos;s &quot; alleged killer amanda clarke . &quot;
give me five minutes .
louise . between murder trial coverage
and designing new corporate headquarters ,
i &apos;m sorry , i completely forgot to call you back .
when do you sleep ?
well , right now , it &apos;s better than i don &apos;t .
what did you need ?
well , it &apos;s regarding the funeral .
um , the church is set ...
and i put out the release .
but when i went to the penthouse
to get some photographs for the program ,
i @-@ i couldn &apos;t get in .
what do you mean ?
well , the concierge said that once the police were through ,
the penthouse was ordered sealed by the executor of her estate ?
i tried to explain to them
that i was like a daughter to victoria , but ...
but the executor is her real daughter ... charlotte .
yeah .
well , um ... it &apos;s locked up until probate ,
and ...
it &apos;s the only place where i can still feel her .
you know , with all her things and pictures and ...
i &apos;d really like to be there one more time to say good @-@ bye .
i &apos;d break in if i could .
oh , sweetheart . no , please don &apos;t .
no , i &apos;ll try to get you a phone number .
thank you .
okay .
i also have you doing a reading after the minister .
it &apos;s a beautiful robert frost poem .
no . no , i don &apos;t want to speak .
no , it &apos;s too public , too personal .
after what we &apos;ve been through ,
i &apos;d be afraid i would never stop crying .
we all need to grieve , margaux .
this is how i grieve .
阿曼达 · 克拉克 隐藏的凶手
i can &apos;t urge strongly enough
the defendant be held without bail .
your honor , is is an arraignment ,
not the a.d.a &apos;s press conference .
on live tv , ms. clarke herself told us she &apos;s a flight risk ...
my client absolutely should be allowed to bond out .
detailing her vast skills in hiding
her identity and meting out ...
she has a spotless record ...
strong ties to community and family .
strong ties ?
she spent four years terrorizing this community .
to redeem a father who is still recovering
from the effects of being wrongly convicted .
that does ...
enough ! nobody here is being paid by the word .
ms. clarke , my thoughts .
i will grant bail , but i do so with great concern
and under the strictest of conditions .
if i hear even a rumor that my conditions for release
have been violated , i will have you locked up so fast
your inscrutable little head will spin .
do you understand ?
yes , i do , your honor .
bail is set at $ 2 million .
now , as for my conditions ...
if you take a step off the property ,
if the monitor is removed , disabled , or tampered with ,
suffolk county p.d. , state police ,
and the u.s. marshal &apos;s office will be immediately notified ,
per order of the court .
is that clear ?
emily ?
it &apos;s clear . tell him .
yes . yes , it &apos;s clear .
okay .
then we &apos;ll leave you to it .
look , ben ...
i &apos;m sorry you got stuck with this gig .
i didn &apos;t get stuck with it .
i told detective yamada that i &apos;m familiar
with the house and the property .
so you volunteered to be the person to keep me locked up .
we &apos;ve really come a long way in the past few weeks .
it &apos;s nothing personal , emily .
i know you better than anyone on the force ,
and so i know that right now ,
you are already pondering a way to get out of that thing .
i volunteered so that i could be the one to tell you don &apos;t do it ,
that you will get caught .
after we catch him , the plan is what ?
look , mason has to have the footage
of victoria admitting that she framed me .
and if he doesn &apos;t , i drag him to court by his feet .
your dad &apos;s out cold .
that regimen &apos;s doing a number on him .
i know .
but he says ...
that &apos;s how he knows it &apos;s working . so ...
thank you for taking him .
of course . it &apos;s why i stayed .
where are we ?
we rejected my offer to go after mason t readwell ,
or to send you .
i am not putting anyone else on his radar .
but you found the trailer park ?
yeah , it &apos;s in stony brook . it &apos;s an hour away .
and you think you &apos;re gonna get out of here
without triggering any alarms ?
we &apos;re working on it .
i got this ankle monitor very used
from an army navy store .
and after a few high @-@ tech , highly complicated switcheroos ,
boom ...
the one on your leg should go off @-@ line ,
and this will become the live monitor and stay here .
and i just walk out the door ?
theoretically .
okay , look , i know that word doesn &apos;t radiate confidence .
guys , i gotta focus here .
can i talk to you outside ?
sure . yeah . anywhere that &apos;s less than 6 feet from the door .
who knew victoria had it in her ?
well , i did . but there &apos;s no way she pulled it off alone .
this plan had a lot of moving parts .
i think mason was just one of them .
i could see if margaux knows anything .
no . no , i don &apos;t wanna pull you into this any further .
i &apos;m here by choice .
but i &apos;d love to ask you something .
look , i know that everything
is spinning out of control ... the arrest ,
your ... dad ,
and you &apos;re just trying to keep your head above water ,
so it &apos;s not the best time for this conversation , but ...
the other night , before you got arrested , i heard that
you came to the airport to tell me not to leave .
and i just ....
i just have to know ...
is that true ?
yes .
i wanted you to stay .
i ...
i wantyou to stay .
when nolan told me that you were leaving ,
i ...
i realized how badly i had messed all this up .
so i went after you .
i was five minutes too late .
or maybe ...
four years too late .
but ...
i wanna be with you .
that &apos;s why i need all of this to work ,
why i &apos;m going after mason ,
if i have to cut my damn foot off .
i want us to have that chance .
um ... so sorry to interrupt .
i need your ankle inside right now , ems .
we &apos;ve got a really small window of time to swap frequencies
and pull this off .
ems .
let &apos;s do this .
rehab is like dieting .
week one is the worst .
you &apos;re doing great .
thank you .
okay .
thanks .
charlotte grayson ?
it &apos;s clarke . do i know you ?
i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
you look just like your dear mother .
have we met ?
no . i &apos;m sorry . not officially . i &apos;m louise . louise ellis ?
you &apos;ve been leaving me messages about the funeral .
yes . it was pressing that i talk to you
because , as i may have mentioned ,
i would like to include some photographs and mementos
of your mother &apos;s amazing life
to bring solace to those she left behind .
i @-@ i do , however , need your permission
to access her penthouse .
yeah , the thing about the funeral ...
oh , i &apos;m so sorry . i overstepped .
you would like to plan it .
no .
it &apos;s that i &apos;m not going , let alone planning one .
i don &apos;t know which victoria grayson you met ,
but my mine was the most manipulative human i &apos;ve ever known .
you don &apos;t mean that .
you &apos;re clearly in shock
or ... or denial .
the only amazing thing about victoria
was her ability to get what she wanted , no matter the cost .
charlotte , she lived for her children .
and it &apos;s important to grieve ,
and i think this memorial service would really ...
i &apos;m actually healthier than i &apos;ve ever been .
and as for grieving , i &apos;ve done my share years ago ,
the first time my mother &quot; died &quot; and then disappeared .
i &apos;m ... sorry . she did what now ?
i have to get to the stables . equine therapy .
it was nice meeting you .
wait , wait , wait .
what about her belongings ?
i &apos;m having them boxed up and shipped to charity .
but don &apos;t you want something to remember her by ?
i &apos;ll tell you what .
you stop calling me , and i &apos;ll tell the hotel
you have my permission to enter her penthouse .
you take whatever &apos;s gonna bring you solace .
what are you doing ?
dad .
are you okay ? did i wake you ?
i &apos;m fine . answer the question .
if something goes wrong , i don &apos;t want you to be complicit .
&quot; if something goes wrong &quot; ?
look around you . everything &apos;s gone wrong .
tell me that you &apos;re not going after mason .
i have to . i don &apos;t have a choice .
it &apos;s called house arrest .
you really think that you won &apos;t get caught ?
your friend the detective is waiting for you to mess up .
nolan is about to set off alarms and short out the power grid .
he built a second monitor , and he &apos;ll use the diversion ...
i don &apos;t care if he builds a damn laser beam
that turns you invisible .
if they throw enough cops , troopers , and marshals at you ...
and they will ...
you will be caught and put in jail
and they will throw away the key until trial .
a trial where they will bury me unless i find mason .
and i &apos;m not gonna spend the rest of my life or yours in prison .
then i &apos;ll go .
what ? no .
tell me where he is . you stay here . i will find mason .
that &apos;s a nice offer , dad .
it &apos;s not an offer . tell me where he is .
stop it . you &apos;re not going . you need to get your rest .
i am your father ,
and i am telling you that you &apos;re not leaving this house .
i &apos;m sorry , dad .
jack .
this cannot be a coincidence .
i remember you saying this is your favorite lunch spot ,
so i took a shot .
i wanted to offer condolences .
i know you and victoria were close .
yes .
and there &apos;s ...
there &apos;s something else .
jack , i &apos;m in the middle of a working lunch .
i @-@ i won &apos;t take long . i just ...
i wanted to know if you noticed the same thing that i did .
the circumstances around victoria &apos;s death , they &apos;re ...
they &apos;re strange .
go ask the person who killed her to explain herself .
i &apos;m not really ...
brazen violence ? a trail of clues ?
it &apos;s sloppy . it &apos;s not emily &apos;s style .
and we both know she would never take someone &apos;s life .
so what are you insinuating , jack ?
i &apos;m not insinuating .
i &apos;m saying that it looks like she was set up .
margaux ...
if you happen to know something about victoria &apos;s death ,
now is the time to speak up .
this is a knee @-@ jerk reaction with you
to defend emily no matter what , even when she kills .
victoria set her up . she didn &apos;t do it alone .
and what do you think happens to the partner she left behind
when it all gets exposed ?
i had such hope for you when i heard you left for california .
you pulled yourself out of the quicksand and escaped .
but you couldn &apos;t stay away .
poor jack .
worry about yourself . i &apos;ll be okay .
no , you won &apos;t .
you hitched your wagon to a damaged psychotic horse ,
and she &apos;s pulling you right off a cliff .
what &apos;s my afternoon like ?
editorial pre @-@ call , budget meeting ,
and your jeweler said he can get you in tomorrow .
nolan , it &apos;s david .
i &apos;m still ...
well , obviously , i &apos;m ...
just call me .
detective hunter .
mr. clarke . how you feeling ?
i was so sorry to hear ....
oh , you know , good days , bad days .
gettin &apos; through it .
if you &apos;re looking for amanda , she &apos;s ...
asleep upstairs ?
yeah . that &apos;s good detective @-@ ing .
i don &apos;t know if you heard .
we had a lot of burglar alarms go off in town .
a spike in the power grid .
so i just thought i &apos;d come by and check .
check up on her ankle bracelet ?
i can assure you it &apos;s still on .
good .
yeah , the monitoring station &apos;s gonna reboot it at 9 : 00 p.m.
and when that happens , her unit will reset
and send out an alert .
so i &apos;ll just need to adjust it .
for real ?
9 : 00 p.m. , huh ?
afraid so .
so she cloned the signal from her monitor ,
linked it to this one , and took hers off @-@ line .
it &apos;s clever .
she didn &apos;t kill victoria .
yeah , well , i guess i &apos;d hope my father would say the same thing .
well , wherever she is ,
she &apos;s back online now .
i like the candlesticks . champagne bottles . clever .
my romantic husband .
he &apos;s into repurposing and all that .
my neighbor across the street was throwing them out .
i figure one man &apos;s trash ...
speaking of , um , do you know where he is ?
he wanted me to come by , but ...
not since yesterday .
the dude cleared out in a hurry . he and his lady friend .
his lady friend ?
well , can you describe her for me ?
i mean , maybe how old she was ? her hair color ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s hard to say . she had big sunglasses .
and it seemed like she was trying to dress down ,
but there was something ...
regal about her .
good skin .
oh , you &apos;re obsessed with skin .
i &apos;m observant .
what about a name ? did you get a name ?
stop ! put your hands in the air .
we have you surrounded .
put your hands up !
get on your knees !
get on your knees now ! on your knees ! now !
ben ...
i can &apos;t tell you how badly i wanted to be wrong .
please , you gotta listen to me .
ben !
okay . thanks .
the lawyer says they &apos;re locking her up through trial .
they &apos;re restricting visitors . family only on a limited basis .
can they do that ?
yeah , they did that , so yes , they can .
why the hell did you let her ?
i didn &apos;t let her do anything .
you should &apos;ve made her stay put
then gone after mason yourself .
and how &apos;d that work out for you ?
come on . you ever talk emily into anything ?
we have to do what she should &apos;ve let us do all along .
we have to prove that victoria and others framed emily .
what others ?
definitely margaux , for one .
when i asked her if she knew anything ,
she stormed out of lunch and into a lemarchal town car ,
and then i saw the license plate .
lmm 16q .
now this is the car that dropped mason off at the trailer park .
look .
okay , so ...
mason is being shuttled around in a lemarchal town car .
margaux &apos;s right in the center of this whole thing .
i &apos;ll tell amanda . they &apos;re letting me see her this morning .
tell her we &apos;re getting her out .
what the hell are you doin &apos; here ?
looking for evidence to clear my innocent friend .
better question ... what the hell are you doing here ?
oh , i have every right and full permission to be here .
victoria grayson was my own personal guardian angel .
louise @-@ speak .
well , let &apos;s put that through google translate and ...
you &apos;re here to help clean up
after your late vindictive friend
and tie up any loose ends
in her crazy @-@ ass attempt to frame emily .
stop that .
you will not disrespect her memory
while standing in her home .
well , i can &apos;t stand in emily &apos;s home
because your guardian angel blew it up !
get out ! out !
you know , how you can look at that woman
and not see what everybody else saw ,
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s beyond me .
because i saw who she really was .
no , you saw who you wanted her to be .
louise , you are one of the most loyal people that i know ,
and that is a quality that i truly adore in you .
but in this case , it was and is misplaced .
you &apos;re wrong .
victoria managed this whole thing .
and i know you think the sun rose and set with her ,
but maybe that &apos;s what she counted on to pull this off ...
your blind faith .
i am not blind .
victoria grayson was the only person in this world
who looked out for me .
you know that &apos;s not true .
no ! go !
get out before i call hotel security !
she &apos;s alive .
i am telling you ,
victoria is alive .
you don &apos;t know that . sounds crazy .
you can &apos;t keep saying that presumed dead people are alive .
think about it . it makes sense . it &apos;s what i would do .
are you okay ? you look pale .
yeah . it &apos;s the meds .
i &apos;m not gonna sign up for any marathons , but i &apos;m fine .
look , i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s impossible ,
but ...
it was her .
how you gonna prove that ?
the police have the physical remains
identified as victoria grayson .
you have the fuzzy recollections
of your pals in the trailer park .
it won &apos;t even make it into court .
then we have to find her .
or mason . but i don &apos;t even know where to look .
you can start with margaux &apos;s car service .
it was a lemarchal town car that took mason to the trailer park .
then i need mrgaux .
what does that mean , you @-@ you need ...
i need five minutes in a room with margaux lemarchal .
amanda , you &apos;re in jail . how ...
dad ?
dad !
dad ! somebody help him !
help ! we need help in here !
sir , we &apos;re gonna get you help right now .
help him ! do something !
dad !
we have a medical emergency .
he &apos;s resting at home .
by the time i got to the e.r. , he was awake . he was stable .
it was like nothing happened .
they &apos;re running more tests , and no results yet .
so they sent david home .
he &apos;s doing okay , right ?
he &apos;s got lymphoma , jack .
you know what i mean .
yeah , i do . i know what you mean .
he &apos;s got the best doctors , cutting @-@ edge treatment .
you know , it &apos;s just the idea of losing him , again .
look , i get it .
and i don &apos;t wanna tell you not to worry , but right now ...
no , no . you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right , jack .
i promised david that we &apos;d do what emily asked . so ...
let &apos;s focus on one clarke at a time .
there he is !
it &apos;s been a while , man .
yeah .
nolan , daryl . this is the guy i was telling you about .
hey . yeah , the police academy washout .
that &apos;s not how i described you . but i didn &apos;t last much longer .
well , so , jack says you &apos;re working private security ?
yeah , for my brother @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s company .
he got me on the gold coast rotation ...
banks , jewelers . you know ,
protecting 1 percenters from the 2 percenters .
well , we appreciate you helping us out .
anything for this guy .
saved my ass out on that obstacle course .
hey , the whole time you were a cop ,
did you ever once have to jump over a 16 @-@ foot wall ?
let me tell you what we need .
yes , that seems appropriate . thank you .
apologies , henri . the grand prix of news cycles .
so you were saying ?
a wreath necklace with 122 marquise diamonds .
you were looking for something elegant but understated ?
for the funeral of a dear friend .
it &apos;s perfect . i &apos;ll take it .
i &apos;ll have it fitted and delivered .
merci .
ma &apos;am , could you take a step back
and open your purse , please ?
no . no , the machine must be broken .
please open the door .
as soon as you take a step back and open your purse .
henri , could you call off your storm trooper here ?
i @-@ i am sorry , ms. lemarchal .
the insurance company insists .
incrediable . okay , you want to look in my bag ?
look in my bag ,
but know that i will not be buying anything from here ...
ma &apos;am ?
i &apos;ve never seen these .
yours ?
no , they &apos;re not mine . i &apos;ve never seen ...
would you come with me
to the back of the store , please , ma &apos;am ?
no , no , i &apos;m not going anywhere except out .
please give me my bag and open the door .
miss , you wanna dial it down ?
no , you dial it down !
do you have any idea how much money i &apos;ve spent in this store ?
i don &apos;t have time for this . get your hands off me !
all right , that &apos;s it . up against the wall .
but this is ridiculous ! what are you ... !
henri , you can expect a call from my attorney .
can you hold her ?
i &apos;m gonna go call this in .
show &apos;s over , people .
are you really doing this ?
ms. lemarchal .
always good to see you , daryl .
i would &apos;ve done that for free .
rich people .
i demand another phone call .
you only get one .
not the county &apos;s fault your lawyer didn &apos;t answer .
this is a mistake . you will see , it will be in every paper .
you can tell the judge all about it in the morning .
morning ? no , no , i need to get out today .
what do you mean morning ? !
it means you were framed at the worst possible time .
amanda .
arraignment court closes at 4 : 00 .
that was 10 minutes ago . sucks for you .
of course you were behind this .
well , that &apos;s a theory .
we &apos;ve got all night to discuss it , among other things .
no , i won &apos;t be talking to you ,
and there &apos;s nothing you can do about it .
you &apos;d think .
2 locked doors , 12 inches of cinder block between us .
and yet ...
hey , i need to speak to someone !
how did you ...
you have more important things to worry about .
hurting me won &apos;t change the fact that you murdered victoria .
you know i didn &apos;t .
you don &apos;t have to get hurt .
just answer my questions .
how did victoria set me up ? whose body was in my house ?
and extra bonus points ...
where &apos;s victoria ?
i know she &apos;s alive .
you are delusional .
delusional with nothing to lose .
the guards schedule gives us exactly 11 minutes ,
which is four minutes longer than i &apos;ll need .
what is all this ?
i trained comprehensively to get revenge for my father .
during my schooling ,
i learned a little something called &quot; practical munitions . &quot;
the art of taking anything from your immediate environment
and turning it into a weapon .
you &apos;re bluffing .
batteries from a flashlight a guard misplaced ,
a set of steel keys ...
there you have it .
one weapon , no waiting .
what is the matter with you ?
what is the matter with you , margaux ?
you filled the empty space in your life
with a lying , dangerous fanatic ,
and that is what you became .
i don &apos;t have sympathy for you . you brought this on yourself .
i don &apos;t know anything .
and i don &apos;t believe you .
now you listen to me .
my father is ill ,
and i refuse to spend the last days of his life in prison
for something that i didn &apos;t do .
so last question , margaux ,
and then i start with the cheekbones .
i &apos;m only gonna ask you once .
how do you want to spend the next seven minutes ?
i hope you rest in peace .
i heard you wanted to see me .
i didn &apos;t know if you &apos;d come .
well , i don &apos;t have a choice .
you said you had new information about this murder ,
so let &apos;s hear it .
there was no murder .
victoria is alive .
all right .
look , i don &apos;t get to decide as to whether or not to show up ,
but i do get to decide when i leave .
ben , listen to me .
she staged a fake murder , set me up , and took off .
we identified her body , emily .
we have dental records and x @-@ rays .
they &apos;re not hers .
she switched them with a woman named mary gaines .
she died last week .
did she now ? mary gaines ?
so this new information
just came to you last night in a dream ?
or by carrier pigeon ?
please , just stop already .
you know , i saw your father earlier .
do you have any idea the damage that you &apos;re causing ?
or the people that you &apos;re hurting out there ?
yes , ben , and i know that you &apos;re one of those people .
look , i am sorry for the way that i treated you ,
for thinking that i didn &apos;t have to be honest
because somehow my life was different .
i know i haven &apos;t been the kind of person that you can trust ,
but please ...
you can trust me now .
i know how victoria pulled this off .
tell me .
i think the seed was planted
the night i gave that interview ...
victoria , if you &apos;re watching ,
it is in your hands to end this .
and the whole world turned against her .
she read up on how to fake one &apos;s own death
and get away ...
i would be remiss
if i didn &apos;t thank you for that brilliant idea
i found on that flash drive of yours .
she knew that without a body ,
remains that could be identified as her own , it wouldn &apos;t work .
sometimes desperation breeds results .
and in this case , the result was an unclaimed body in new jersey .
someone who wouldn &apos;t be missed .
and with that , victoria set her plan in motion .
she made it look like
i attacked her in a parking garage ,
made sure there were witnesses
who would say as much to the police .
she staged her penthouse to look like she was assaulted ...
seasoned liberally with her blood ...
the rest of which she gave to mason to plant in my car .
she altered her handwriting just enough
to make her suicide note
look like a good but not great forgery .
all that was left was the big finish ...
making the world believe
that i was a bigger monster than she had ever been .
a monster who burned the queen alive
in the castle she used to own .
that &apos;s ...
so ... where is she now ?
i don &apos;t know .
i see .
so she staged this whole thing .
she fooled everyone on earth but you
and just disappeared .
you don &apos;t believe me . you don &apos;t think i &apos;m telling the truth .
no , it -- it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t think you &apos;re telling the truth .
it &apos;s that i don &apos;t think you know how to tell the truth .
all right , i don &apos;t think there &apos;s any difference in your head
between the stories that you spin and actual facts .
and that is what makes you dangerous .
ben , please , listen to me . she is out there .
this one time , i need you to believe me .
i know you do .
but ...
i don &apos;t .
excuse me ? detective ?
ms. ellis . is everything okay ?
well , yes . i asked for you , and they sent me here .
is this okay ?
yes , please , sit down .
how can i help you ?
so i found something , and ...
i didn &apos;t know what to do .
so ...
this was in victoria grayson &apos;s closet .
i found it hidden inside a garment bag .
you found this in victoria &apos;s penthouse ?
do you recognize it ?
looks like the one victoria said
emily was wearing when she was attacked .
look ...
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying this , but , um ...
what if victoria killed herself
and made it look like emily did it ?
you &apos;re a long way from the hamptons , detective .
yeah .
sign here .
and i &apos;ll need the name of the deceased .
mary gaines .
okay . yeah .
died last week , still unclaimed . drawer a12 .
there must be a mistake .
bodies don &apos;t just disappear .
no . not usually .
your guy has juice .
gettin &apos; a judge on the phone at home ?
am i done here ?
free to go .
arraignment &apos;s tomorrow .
margaux .
louise ?
what are you doing here ?
your office said you were gettin &apos; out today .
and we need to talk .
i &apos;m in a hurry .
listen , i spoke with detective hunter ,
and ...
wait . why ?
i think victoria lied to us .
when i was packing up her penthouse ,
i found the hoodie that she said emily was wearing
when she supposedly attacked her .
no , emily did attack her .
if she lied about that ,
she could &apos;ve lied about a lot of things .
and you told detective hunter this ?
i think nolan was right .
when i talked to him at the penthouse ...
wait . nolan ?
nolan ross was in victoria &apos;s penthouse ?
well , he was trying to sneak in through the fire door .
but he was looking for proof that victoria had framed emily .
nolan is a liar and manipulator .
you know that better than anyone .
how many times are you going to let him do this to you ?
but he wasn &apos;t lying this time . i &apos;m certain of it .
you mean when you caught him
breaking into victoria &apos;s hotel room ?
something we can assume he &apos;s done before .
are you saying he planted the hoodie ?
of course he did . that &apos;s what he does .
he wanted you to find it .
well , if that &apos;s the case , then i played right into his hands .
margaux , i don &apos;t feel so good .
you &apos;re exhausted . and who can blame you ?
it &apos;s been a terrible week for all of us .
go put some cold water on your face .
then i &apos;ll take you home .
it &apos;s mademoiselle lemarchal .
i need to retain your services immediately .
it &apos;s urgent .
no . no , that can &apos;t be . they said they caught it early .
well , that was based on the initial tests .
then after the seizure , they ran different tests .
it spread .
it &apos;s in my brain .
well , so they &apos;ll treat that , too ,
with more chemotherapy , right ?
no .
no , they stopped the chemotherapy .
and replacing it with what ?
nothing .
stage iv lymphoma .
there &apos;s no more ways to fight it .
well , that &apos;s because they aren &apos;t trying hard enough .
how long ? how ... how many years ?
not years .
months .
they said maybe six months if i &apos;m lucky .
no , i don &apos;t believe that . neither do you .
amanda ...
doctors are wrong all the time .
this is one of those times .
we will see specialists . we will get other opinions .
i did . i got the same opinions .
i can get more , but it won &apos;t change .
you don &apos;t know that . you don &apos;t know anything .
there are clinical trials , experimental drugs .
i have money to spend on this .
nolan has money to spend on this .
if we have to fund our own damn lab ,
that is what we will do .
how did you learn to fight so hard ?
say it , dad .
tell me that is what we will do .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ll do .
yeah .
son of a bitch .
you are alive .
never go to new jersey on business .
you ...
