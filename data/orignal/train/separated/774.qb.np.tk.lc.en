aw , thank you .
hello .

because i read the website vigorously , kumari .

i &apos;m not talking about her . hell no , not her !
i &apos;m talking about you .
when this thing blows up in your face--
and it will blow up in your face , nick--
you &apos;re the one moving out .
you think i like living with you ?
you have centipedes living under your bed !
those weren &apos;t centipedes .
you &apos;ve named your testicles ,
and they &apos;re both named sharon .

only people who haven &apos;t moved on say things like that .
i &apos;m a squirrel . you &apos;re my nut .
winter &apos;s coming .
i &apos;m gonna store you in my cheek , girl .
please leave .
you and i not being together
does not make sense to me .
i miss your body
and the things i used to do to it .
schmidt .
i &apos;m talking about sex .
today is about me finding someone
within my own culture
that i can build my life with .
it &apos;s about more than sex .
our sex was about more than sex .
it was about history and memory
and thousands of years of colonial suffering
all being released in one moment of pure ecstasy .
then why did the sex always end with you yelling ,
&quot; blammo , that happened &quot; ?
blammo .
thank you .
hey .
oh , you can walk normally now , i see .
i &apos;m sorry i kissed you .
well , oh , wow .
that was unexpected .
thanks , nick .
you know what , it was a mistake .
i feel better .
&apos;cause , yeah , i was feeling awkward .
yeah , right . you were acting a little bit weird ,
but honestly , for me , it was , like , a nothing kiss .
you know , it was like kissing a cousin .
it was so nonsexual and nothing .
well ... i think it meant something .
you know , to you , &apos; cause you kissed me .
i think you can admit it meant something to you , nick .
oh , no , i @-@ i &apos;m telling you , it meant nothing to me .
i think it did .
no , no .
i do things i don &apos;t mean all the time .
like this . you see this ? bottle of water .
why did i do that ? i don &apos;t know .
it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
i think you can admit that it meant something to you .
hey , jessica , it didn &apos;t .
it was a drinking game , and i was finishing the game .
yeah , but it happened after the game
when it meant something .
oh , so it meant something to you ?
what ?
it meant something to you .
no , don &apos;t ...
if you think some stupid , terrible kiss ...
you &apos;re thinking about it right now !
no !
i &apos;m calling sam and ...
oh , you &apos;re calling sam right now ?
he &apos;s gonna come here and pick me up ,
and , uh , we &apos;re leaving .
oh , you are ?
why are you running away ?
because it meant something ?
we &apos;re not going anywhere .
meant nothing , nick !
please look at the numbers on your name tags
and go to the table with the corresponding numbers .
these are your groupings .
people with similar resumes and education backgrounds
have been grouped together .
thirty four , thirty four , thir ...

so this is rock bottom .
i mean , call me crazy ,
but i think we &apos;re all getting married tonight .
yeah , um ...
the money table right here , table 34 !
hi , excuse me , i think that there &apos;s been
just a little bit of a mistake with the tables .
over 30 , no advanced degrees ,
part @-@ time employment : table 34 .
no , see , actually , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m a professional model .
i &apos;m not famous or anything ,
but i was in lil wayne &apos;s last video .
i was the girl he was throwing strawberries at in slow motion .
definitely table 34 .
excuse me ?
uh , i didn &apos;t get assigned a table .
now , i know exactly what this is about ...
but i did assign you a seat .
this one . lap number one .
okay , so this is not a racial thing ?
not yet , it isn &apos;t .
i see what &apos;s happening here .
you &apos;re feeling my mojo .
you look like a jumpy cat , and i like that .
i like that .
like oversized blueberries .
mojo off . mojo off .
schmidt , table seven , table seven .

jess !

this is a weird date .
i always thought we &apos;d go bowling before we went
to an indian marriage convention .
what table are you at ?

table one ? !
it &apos;s almost like you save lives or something .

okay , i &apos;m trying .
seriously .
dummy .
stop pointing your finger at me . that &apos;s so annoying .
why are you drinking my beer ?
you point that finger at me one more time , i &apos;m ...
why don &apos;t you just admit that that kiss meant something to you ?
no , no !
i could tell it meant something , so admit it
or i &apos;ll do this all day . i &apos;ll do it all day .
next challenge : make a table
out of nothing but newspaper and tape .
women look to your left , men to the right .
these are your partners .
you got to be kidding me .
first table that can hold a phone book wins .
all right , so we have to make a table .
okay .
give me the tape .
no .
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s not made out of newspaper ,
that tight little ass of yours .
jess , you liked kissing me !
it &apos;s fine to say that .
no , i didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m not on my knee asking you
to marry me ; it was a nice kiss .
you were like a dog and my mouth
was like a bowl full of dog ... milk !
it was like a damn fairy tale , that kiss !
it was the best kiss of your life .
are you serious , nick ?
and you have to take
a little responsibility , tarting around in that
little soft pink robe ,
not expecting to get kissed .
tarting around ?
i &apos;m a man , jessica !
what ?
pink robes are my catnip .
and we have a winning couple !
we are not a couple !
we &apos;re not a couple .
and this is a very bad table .
terrible table .
and stop clapping , everybody .
this is awful .
look . it won &apos;t hold anything .
be prepared to laugh !
no , i mean , this is , like ...
i got it , i got it .
here , put it down . just-- okay .
very weak table .
break !
it &apos;s a strong table .
strong table , strong couple .
come on . jump up , yeah .
jump up ! jump up ! jump up !
come on .
it &apos;s real , man .
come on .
that &apos;s an impressive table !
congratulations on winning the table @-@ building competition , baby .

i didn &apos;t think it meant anything .
yeah , no , just-- nick just drives me crazy .
it &apos;s like ... you know ?
yeah , i mean , i never ...
well , yeah , that &apos;s just ... that &apos;s what i was saying .

do you like field hockey ?
i ... yeah . yeah .
hi !
i &apos;m so sorry , sweetie . pass .
so , when did you decide to become a model ?
oh . didn &apos;t really think about it at all .

it &apos;s my favorite color .
i didn &apos;t say anything .
shut up , shut up , shut up .
so how many children do you want ?
well , i have to start soon ,
so i guess i &apos;ll just jump right in .

yeah , you have to go over there .
okay . bye @-@ bye .
go now . hi .
sam , i do have something to tell you .
you know why we &apos;re at table 34 ?
&apos;cause we &apos;re both bad at life , but we have model good looks .
it &apos;s &apos; cause we don &apos;t think things through .
you didn &apos;t think it through when you kissed jess .
she told me . it &apos;s like we just make these impulsive decisions ,
and all we end up doing is hurting other people .
i can &apos;t believe this .
no . no , sam ...
sam ? wait .
sam , wait .
i &apos;m really sorry .
i said i wanted to commit to this .
i thought you understood what that meant .
i do . i did .
hey , hey . sam , listen .
what ?
sam , hear me out .
i kissed her , okay ?
she didn &apos;t kiss me .
it didn &apos;t mean anything to her .
thank you .
oh , my god !
i &apos;m sorry , nick . it &apos;s the training .
he &apos;s in such terrible shape ! you could &apos;ve killed him .
i &apos;m gonna kick your ass , man .
jess , it may not have meant something
to you , but it meant something to me .
is there another doctor in the house ? !
with this crowd , i &apos;m sure .
i &apos;m done . so ...
good @-@ bye , jess .
no . sam .
ice it , 24 hours .
and keep it elevated .
he even exits cool .
oh , god .
anu ? i got something for you .
now , this is freddy .
as you can see , he has the exact
same build as me , all right ?
and he is totally available . ain &apos;t that right , freddy ?
that is what i call an arranged bang .
freddy , are you scared of being confined in small spaces ?
oh , you &apos;ll do just fine .
now , just remember , wherever you are ,
the mojo man is there .
damn it , schmidt .
i &apos;m taking this .
excuse me . excuse me ! hold up !
you know , when i came here today ,
i thought india was a pretty cool country .
you guys are obviously smart .
you l @-@ looked at the roof of a bus and you said ,
&quot; that &apos;s not just a roof , that &apos;s more seating . &quot;
kal penn , he &apos;s a genius . thank you for him .
but what i didn &apos;t know
is that you &apos;re a country full of blind idiots .
oh , god .
because in your midst
walks a brown angel .
that woman . right there .
i may be an idiot ,
but i &apos;m smart enough to know what i lost .
you people could &apos;ve had it all .
and you shoved her over there at a table with nick .
get your crap together , india .
schmidt ...
out !
hello . i didn &apos;t see you over here .
i would love to ...
sorry i didn &apos;t see you earlier .
okay . they &apos;re all-- okay .
you don &apos;t all have to run over there at once .
i mean , she ... she &apos;s not that great , you guys .
i mean , she &apos;s kind of old .
you should see her areolas-- one &apos;s like a helicopter pad ,
the other one &apos;s like a , you know , like ...
like a tick bite .
it &apos;s freaky . very disorienting .
is this making you feel better at all ?
i just wanted to listen to taylor swift alone !
how &apos;s that ?
you know when you get dumped and you &apos;re , like , racking your brain
for what was it that i did wrong ?
well , this is a really unique situation
in that i don &apos;t have to do that .
well , what happened ?
i &apos;m sorry . i know what-- i know that it &apos;s my fault .
i didn &apos;t mean it like ...
jess , can i say something
that &apos;ll potentially not help this situation ?
no .
i &apos;ve never been a home @-@ wrecker .
and i liked it .
i mean , sam was threatened by me .
i mean , i see that as a victory .
but in @-@ in more important ...
uh , ways , a huge , huge , devastating loss .
for you .
should i call cece ?
this feels like cece territory .
this isn &apos;t nick territory .
this is , uh ...
look , jess ...
i &apos;m sorry , okay ,
that i kissed you .
but i shouldn &apos;t have done it ,
because it was obviously a mistake ,
and now you &apos;re crying and ...
i won &apos;t do it again .
well ...
maybe it was a little bit broken to begin with .
what happened ?
he just ...
he always wanted to fist bump in the morning .
and you didn &apos;t like that ?
i hated it . what are ... what ...
i feel like you &apos;re forgiving me .
no .
i felt like before i said that you were though .
nope . nope .
now you remembered you &apos;re still mad at me . no ? okay .
all right , good night , nick . night .
okay , good night , jess .
hey , jess .
too soon ?
yeah , too soon !
well , hey , good night . and i &apos;m sorry about everything .
okay .
okay , yeah .
that was ...
yeah . that was ...
a little bit weird .
so weird .
let &apos;s not ever do that again .
yeah .
do it again . okay .
good night . night , miller !
good night .
good night , sergeant .
i &apos;m glad everything &apos;s back to normal around here .
thank you for what you said up there .
you know , i got a lot of phone numbers .
good .
i think i &apos;m gonna go on a lot of dates .
i think that &apos;s a great thing . good .
yeah .
the plan hasn &apos;t changed . i am still marrying an indian guy .
no , yeah , that &apos;s fine .
okay ?
but you went home with a jew in a turban , so i &apos;m just saying .
just take this off .
come on . let &apos;s go .
god , i have missed this .
turban on ? turban off ?
i &apos;m gonna hate myself for saying this , but ...
