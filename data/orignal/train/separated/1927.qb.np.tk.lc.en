&quot; i must have lost it on the wind &quot;
i looked up my birth mom . ellis grey . did you know her ?
i want another baby .
yang is leaving a seat open .
and i &apos;m recommending you .
she left me her seat .
i was gonna ask you to be by my side
for the rest of our lives .
he &apos;s very dreamy . but he is not the sun . you are .
you &apos;re asking me to choose between this job ...
and my family ?
i am staying here .
owen knows this is the right move for me .
so you can go .
when i was 5,
my mom lost me in a park .
i don &apos;t remember much ,
except that one minute , i was riding the carousel
and the next ... she was gone .
i don &apos;t remember how i found her .
i don &apos;t remember how i got home .
are you okay ?
all i remember is what happened next .
she told me not to worry .
she told me everything would be fine .
they are saving your mother &apos;s life .
don &apos;t put that on me . stop it !
don &apos;t touch me !
she told me it was time to play the quiet game ,
so i knew i wasn &apos;t supposed to ask any questions ...
would you like to see her ?
no . absolutely not . no .
... or else , i might have told her ...
i forgot my doll .
i loved that doll so much .
it killed me to leave it behind .
funny , isn &apos;t it , the way memory works ...
the things you can &apos;t quite remember
and the things you can never forget ?
you really should get your locks changed .
what are you doing here ?
i need to talk to alex .
wilson , get out of the bed .
i can &apos;t get in the bed with you in there .
you can &apos;t kick me out of bed .
it &apos;s my house .
no , it &apos;s my house .
then you kick her out .
i &apos;m not wearing any--
i don &apos;t care about your boobs , wilson . out .
oh , my god .
i guess i &apos;ll go make us some coffee since i &apos;m up .
coffee would be great .
this is not our thing now , okay ?
you can &apos;t just start showing up at all hours and --
i mean , this is not what we do .
i told derek i am not moving to d.c.
the children and i are staying here .
all right , the miracle is over .
the miracle is not over .
we &apos;re not a miracle . shut up .
you can &apos;t break into my house and wake me up to talk
and then tell me to shut up !
okay .
so , here &apos;s what happened --
last night , i found out i have a daughter .
or at least , i think she &apos;s my daughter .
all these years , i ...
i had no idea , and now she &apos;s here .
she doesn &apos;t know who i am ,
and i can &apos;t talk about it to anyone .
so , i figure i &apos;d wind up one of two places --
either here ... or in a bar , so i ...
anyway ...
here i am .
you &apos;re here early .
yeah , an mvc came in last night after you left .
the driver had an open @-@ book pelvis , so i stuck around .

and ask them to meet me at the helipad .
can you finish up here ?
sure , yeah .
he &apos;s dying inside .
he seems fine .
well , sure . he &apos;s a soldier .
he &apos;s stuffing everything down , but he needs a buddy .
you could be his buddy .
nope .
oh , come on !
how would you feel if i were the one who left ?
you lying awake at night in your empty bed ...
what kind of buddy are you asking me to be ?
should they be flying in this ? !
no choice !

he is ?
well , we will address that when we reconvene .
karev , you need something , too ?
yeah , um , these are yang &apos;s shares of the hospital
along with a certified letter .

so , you can just hand off board seats to whomever you want ?
i mean , what about the members of this hospital ?
don &apos;t we have rights ? don &apos;t we have a voice ?
what are the rules here ?
i said i &apos;ll talk to legal . it &apos;s an unprecedented situation .

i have them in my hand .
and where the hell have you been ?
well , i was --

but if you ever wanted to talk , you could , to me .
i &apos;m a really good listener , and it &apos;s not like
i don &apos;t have things
that i would rather not have everybody here know .
i mean , i haven &apos;t even told my own brother about --
i don &apos;t wanna to talk .
the last name is peterson .
the wind blew my son &apos;s frisbee up onto our roof .

hey , chief , you got a minute ?
i &apos;ve got to go check on my john doe in c.t. , but what &apos;s up ?
uh , well , are you busy tonight ?
&apos;cause a couple of guys are probably gonna get together .
you know , uh , hit joe &apos;s , grab some brewskies .
oh , yeah ? who &apos;s going ?
so far , there &apos;s me , uh , a @-@ and you .
okay , well , um , i don &apos;t know
what time i &apos;m gonna get out of here tonight ,
so can i let you know ?
yeah . absolutely . yes . let me know .
see ? was that so hard ?
yes . it was .
what i don &apos;t understand is , why a car ?
you &apos;re in a building full of beds and supply closets .
we haven &apos;t seen each other in weeks .
my dad was just transferred to portland last month .
yeah , plus , it &apos;s kind of hard
to get privacy on a peds floor .
because it &apos;s a place for young children to heal ,
not to have sex .
you told her ?
two teenagers in a car ?
i did the math .
your collarbone is broken , dave ,
and your shoulder is really badly bruised .
david lincoln oldroyd ,
you were supposed to be taking it easy !
you weren &apos;t even supposed to be out of bed .
and you definitely weren &apos;t supposed to have visitors .
yeah , well , it &apos;s not like i planned
to have a gurney fall on us .
don &apos;t you smart off to me .
some of these glass shards are embedded pretty deeply .
i may have to shave some of your hair .
are you kidding ?
no !
yes ! awesome ! i -- shave it all !
rock on !
no !
i &apos;ve been trying to shave my head in solidarity forever .
it &apos;s so dumb .
why would anyone volunteer to be bald ?
no , you &apos;re gonna love it .
it &apos;s so smooth and so sweet .
you are so getting separate rooms .
okay , well , the good news is ,
everyone &apos;s fine , so let &apos;s just focus on that , okay ?
yikes , that mom was harsh and judgy and --
no , i totally agree with her .
you do ?
you don &apos;t ?
robbins , i just stopped by to check on the u.t.o.
i repaired at 21 weeks ,
and the parents could not stop singing the praises of you .
ah , you should have seen the surgery
that dr. herman performed on this baby in utero .
it was masterful .
yes , it was .
but the baby hits the air , you do a few little stitches ,
and you get all the credit .
how is that fair ?
oh , by the way , i &apos;m still looking to fill my fellowship ,
if you hear of anybody good .
maybe you should apply .
yeah , then you could learn to do something that &apos;s actually hard .
well , i actually do really hard things in peds .
really ? uh , like the teens in the parking lot .
how are they ?
fine .
oh , they &apos;re morons .
when do you leave for d.c. , anyway ?
i was gonna ask meredith if i could store some things
in your side of the closet .
did meredith tell you that ?
you both did , loudly ,
until about 4 : 00 in the morning .
how does it work exactly ?
you &apos;re not separated , but you &apos;re not living together .
meredith &apos;s staying behind ?
she is .
and you &apos;re cool with that ?
you &apos;re together but living apart ...
live @-@ a @-@ partners !
see that ? i gave it a name . now it &apos;s a thing .
yeah , i &apos;m familiar with that thing .
i did it with miranda .
how did it work out for you guys ?
well , seeing as i &apos;m not living in l.a. anymore ,
i &apos;d say it didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s not crazy , right ,
to go after this opportunity ?
i &apos;m not a bad person for wanting this .
no , but meredith &apos;s not either .
this is her home . it &apos;s your kids &apos; home .
you can &apos;t blame her for wanting to stay .
how are you gonna get laid when the person
you get laid with is here and you are in d.c. ?
oh , grow up . it &apos;s a valid question .
okay . removing the skull flap .
this won &apos;t take a long .
dr. hunt and i will be just over there .
i have to go .
oh , no , no , no , no , no .
i &apos;m gonna need you to stay still , okay ?
well , they &apos;re still out there .
the authorities are looking for your family ,
and they &apos;re notify us as soon as --
i can &apos;t -- i can &apos;t be here . i have to go .
okay . uh , how about if i stay with you , right here ?
would you like that , if i just stay here .
i &apos;ll stay here with you .
i -- i found footprints ,
and th-- they &apos;re so tiny that they have to be hers .
it &apos;s my little girl , lily .
she &apos;s only 6 years old .
we were trying to find nine mile falls ,
and the car died and i was -- i went to go find help .
i told them i would -- i told them i would be right back .
it &apos;s lily and it &apos;s my wife ,
and i @-@ if if they &apos;re separated ,
if lily is by herself right now ...
it &apos;s already been three days ,
and she &apos;s not gonna make it without any water .
so , i have to go right now , and we have to hurry .
please !
you &apos;ve -- you &apos;ve been in the desert for more than three days .
i -- i know .
it &apos;s maybe -- maybe f-- maybe four days .
based on your state of dehydration
and your level of malnutrition ,
i think it &apos;s been more like one or two months .
what ?
no .
what ?
they &apos;re gone , aren &apos;t they ? my lily ?
my lily . she &apos;s 6 .
she &apos;s 6 years old .
oh , my lily .
grey , we need to move him now .
tell them we have a name for his daughter .
her name is lily .
and they found him at saddle mountain .
that &apos;s 100 miles from nine mile falls .
they &apos;ve been looking for his family in the wrong spot .
dr.grey.
i stopped by c.t. to take the patient for his echo ,
but you were gone .
echo has to wait .
lily ...
his right kidney has severe e.p.n. and abscesses .
we &apos;re taking him up to o.r. 3 right now .
whoa , whoa , sir ! hey . sir , lay down .
i have to get off !
lay down , sir , please !
lay down .
i still need that echo .
not now .
you know what &apos;s weird ?
i keep paging cardio
and expecting cristina to just walk through the door .
pierce is no yang . she &apos;s perky and chatty .
i bet she likes cats .
sorry to interrupt .
mr. crossley &apos;s anastomosis may be leaking .
oh , so , you &apos;re gonna take him back for a wash out ?
we &apos;re prepping him in o.r. 1 right now .
great
is there something else ?
you have ... very steady hands .
thank you .
uh , have you ever played jenga ,
you know , where -- where you stack the little bricks
and try not to make them fall ?
yeah .
you should come over sometime .
i &apos;ll make snacks .
okay .
or if , uh , you &apos;re not into jenga , there &apos;s checkers .
oh , my god !
i -- i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re actually doing this !
oh , my parents are gonna freak !
they &apos;re gonna freak ?
what about me ? i &apos;m fully freaking over here .
all right . that &apos;s it .
oh , my god .
adorable right ? we are like alien lovers .
one of the legs needs some stitches .

17 @-@ year @-@ old female , trauma to the head .
i can handle things here . okay .
warren , you coming ?
well , actually , would you mind if i stayed here ?
no offense , but you &apos;ve already got one foot out the door ,
and this dr. shepherd is the new head of neuro .
so , you want to stay here and not come with me ?
why not ? seems to be the trend these days .
the site is prepped and ready .
okay , let &apos;s flush this with collins and heparin
and put this kidney in its new place .
b.p. just dropped out . is there a pulse ?
i don &apos;t know .
okay . edwards , stay with the kidney while i bring him back .
let &apos;s get a crash cart in here .
push 1 of epi .
starting compressions .
c.v.p. is soaring .
page pierce , get her in here .
and let &apos;s order an echo .
right away .
stopping compressions to check rhythm .
pulseless v tach .
charge paddles to 150 .
clear !
how bad is it ?
it &apos;s an epidural bleed .
i cannot believe they snuck out to that car .
if i were her mother and this brain bleed didn &apos;t kill her ,
i would totally kill her .
oh , god . oh , god ,
i sound just like my father when i was a teenager .
what is -- what is wrong with me ?
i love him , but i don &apos;t want our daughter
to have my father for a mother .
i don &apos;t know what you just said ,
but it &apos;s nice to see what our kids have
in so far for them someday or kid .
you sure you don &apos;t want to consider surrogate ?
ok , i can &apos;t watch this .
i &apos;m gonna go check on the ...
will you tell me when it &apos;s , um -- when it &apos;s over ?
yeah .
okay .
okay .
what happened ?
we were about to do the autotransplant on his kidney
when his b.p. dropped out .
i &apos;ll take over .
i think he &apos;s in cardiogenic shock .
thank you . i &apos;ve got this .
he &apos;s got a failed mitral valve from endocarditis .
he &apos;ll need a balloon pump .
gown and glove me .
pack the belly and get a cardiac team in here .
edwards , prep the right groin .
edwards is monitoring the kidney .
edwards , now .
let &apos;s get this o.r. changed out . these need to go .
dr. pierce , you realize that i have another surgery to finish
as soon as you &apos;re done here .
quickly , people .
dr. pierce , i &apos;m talking to you .
and i am ignoring you .
we &apos;ve got a patient in cardiac distress ,
which could have been avoided
if i had gotten that echo earlier .
i let you overrule me before . that is not gonna happen again .
no matter how important you are around here , dr. grey .
i have a duty to help this patient , not kiss your ass .
dr. hunt , i could use an assist .
dr. edwards , let &apos;s make sure
that that kidney is prepped and ready to go .
as soon as she &apos;s finished , we &apos;ll get back in there .
oh , no .
what &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s gone . - what &apos;s gone ?
the basin with the kidney . the kidney is gone .
well , look for it !
look on the floor ,
look in the hazardous waste bins , look everywhere .
i &apos;m sorry , dr. grey . i took my eyes off it for two minutes .
because dr. pierce came in and started ordering you around .
yes , i was ordering the resident around .
with no knowledge of what she was already doing .
are you blaming me for your resident &apos;s incompetence ?
that is ridiculous . - you should have never barged in --
hey , we have a patient open on the table
who needs our undivided attention .
both of you , settle down . - she &apos;s the one --
she &apos;s accusing me of losing a kidney -- - i said settle down !
oh , i found it !
they dumped it in the basin .
it &apos;s been in the sink the whole time .
let &apos;s get it in here and see if we can save it .
pupil &apos;s blown .
he &apos;s herniating . damn it !
hey , just wanted to get an update on mr. peterson for his wife .
push 100 grams of 20 % mannitol !
i.c.p. is still elevated .
more mannitol ! his brain injury &apos;s too far gone .
we &apos;ve been trying to salvage things .
how long has he been down ?
37 minutes .
i &apos;m gonna call it .
time of death , 18 : 32 .
kepner , is everything okay ?
yeah , yeah . no , i &apos;m fine . it &apos;s just ...
he was just trying to get his kid &apos;s frisbee , you know ?
dr. shepherd &apos;s doing everything he can for monica ,
but it &apos;s just ...
she seemed so fine , giving me attitude .
are her parents ... ?
on a plane now . they should be here soon .
when they &apos;re babies , you --
you spend every night by their crib ,
just watching them , make sure that they &apos;re still breathing .
they start walking ,
so you childproof every inch of your house .
they start climbing trees ,
and you just pray that they don &apos;t fall
and crack their head open .
they turn 16 ...
... and they get cancer .
and ...
just when you &apos;re finally about to beat that ,
they sneak out to a parking lot to have sex
and a gurney falls out of the sky !
i mean , how are we supposed to do it ?
how are we ever supposed to keep them safe ?
it &apos;s bad news , isn &apos;t it ?
hey , we &apos;ll be right in .
you should stay in bed , keep that shoulder immobilized .
you guys have been out here a long time .
is it &apos; cause she &apos;s dead ?
you &apos;re trying to figure out how to tell me ?
no , sweety , monica is not dead .
yet . you -- you mean she hasn &apos;t died yet .
what am i gonna tell her parents ?
how am i gonna explain to them ...
... that i &apos;m the reason she --
oh , whoa , whoa , no .
no one has died , okay ?
we are -- we &apos;re just gonna sit here ,
and we &apos;re gonna think good thoughts .
don &apos;t you worry .
it &apos;s like the fight &apos;s gone out of him .
he &apos;s been this way since he woke up from surgery --
listless , confused .
well , his pupils are responsive .
can you follow this light for me ?
i just want to sleep .
i know you &apos;re tired , but this is an important examination .
you &apos;re a doctor ?
i am .
then help me . give me something .
put me to sleep .
that &apos;s when they come ,
when i close my eyes and i go places .
and then they come in the door and everything &apos;s --
everything &apos;s fine .
i shouldn &apos;t have left them .
i should never have left them .
leave me alone please .
i just want to sleep .
karev ?
what are you doing ?
nothing .
but , uh , you don &apos;t want to go in there .
you had no right to accuse me --
i have every right .
i have never experienced this --
this level of disrespect and this lack of professionalism --
respect is earned ,
and if you want to talk about being unprofessional ,
i spoke directly to you and you ignored me in my o.r.
you ignored my request for an echo this morning .
my patient was circling the drain , and i was doing my job .
and i was doing mine .
i spent all morning deferring to you ,
trying not to step on your toes , for what ?
because i wanted you to like me ?
well , guess what . i &apos;m kind of over that now .
yeah , you definitely don &apos;t have to worry about me liking you .
it took my last two dollars .
and it won &apos;t give me my granola bar !
hmm . everything okay ?
meredith grey .
she &apos;s your sister .
yeah , you figured that out , too .
i was hoping ...
i was gonna talk to her today , tell her .
first , i was gonna win her over with my talent and charm ,
and then i --
i found my sister , and i think i hate her .
she &apos;s terrible .
she &apos;s not . she &apos;s -- - what am i doing ?
i have parents --
good , funny , kind , goofy parents .
i don &apos;t need any -- screw it .
screw her .
i am just fine without adding any random ,
unwanted blood relatives into my life .
i &apos;ll pay you back tomorrow .
not necessary .
think he &apos;ll be able to hang on ?
oh , it &apos;s hard to predict .
oh , did you catch the game last night ?
what game ?
w @-@ wasn &apos;t there a game ?
i don &apos;t know . i just asked you .
all right , screw this .
see , kepner is worried about you .
she asked me to take you out .
what , like a date ?
no , not a date .
it &apos;s like a -- a man @-@ date thing but not like a date .
listen , i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m gonna be fine .
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s not fine .
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s splitting up with his wife .
i &apos;m not splitting up . i got a job .
on the other side of the country .
oh , cristina &apos;s on the other side of the world .
she &apos;s not my wife .
sh @-@ she and i split up , whereas you two , you &apos;re --
wait , this is none of your business .
just stop asking me out on dates !
how &apos;s this for solidarity ?
you know what ? dave &apos;s mom &apos;s right .
even -- even if you play it safe ,
you aren &apos;t safe , not really ,
so we might as well take a few risks , right ?
i &apos;m so happy to hear you say that .
you are ? - yeah , &apos; cause i @-@ i -- well ,
i have something to talk to you about .
me too .
about this morning . oh !
you were right . i was overreacting .
you know what ? we can &apos;t control everything .
so we should do it .
let &apos;s get a surrogate and have another baby .
absolutely .
oh , no , um , well , actually i was talking about
the , um , fetal surgery fellowship
that dr. herman mentioned .
oh . oh , okay .
y-- so , you &apos;re , uh , recommending somebody ?
i thought maybe ... me .
i could get double @-@ certified . it &apos;s an incredible opportunity .
so , you &apos;re ...
essentially going back to school ?
it &apos;ll be hard , i know --
you know , study sessions and longer hours .
and a new baby .
right . so , that &apos;s why i was just --
that &apos;s all . i was just thinking about it .
you guys coming ?
what &apos;s this about , again ?
yang &apos;s board seat .
oh , that &apos;s a no @-@ brainer .
it &apos;s bailey .
yeah , it &apos;s alex .
so , here is what we know -- karev has a letter
from yang &apos;s attorney granting him her shares
and her board seat .
so , that &apos;s karev &apos;s seat .
uh , not so fast .
according to the bylaws of the foundation ,
new board members are appointed by a majority vote
from other members .
that is the closest thing we have to a rule .
so , what do we do ?
i propose we let them fight it out .
can i talk to you after this ?
dr. grey ?
there &apos;s news about the hiker &apos;s family .
i did .
hi . thank you .
yang gave me her shares for a reason .
i know you don &apos;t think i deserve the seat ,
but i don &apos;t want to screw it up , i &apos;m not gonna screw it up .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;d make an excellent board member .
hey , may the best surgeon win .
that was nice of you .
yes , it was .
you think he &apos;s got a shot ?
please . it &apos;s alex karev .
how is mr. peterson ?
on my way to talk to his family now .
it &apos;s gonna be super fun .
i love telling little kids that dad is never coming home .
i &apos;ll go with you .
actually , i &apos;d appreciate that .
yeah , somebody should be there
to make sure you don &apos;t say things like &quot; super fun . &quot;
ah . good note .
hey , luca . what a cool spaceship .
where &apos;s your mom ?
dr. shepherd ?
luca , we just need to talk to your mom over here for sec .
you cool to hang out , work on that spaceship ?
no .
oh , no .
what happened ?
mom ?
i &apos;ll stay with him .
come on with me .
come on . this way , luca .
i want to go with my mom .
i haven &apos;t seen a spaceship with a trap door before .
want to show me how to use it ?
my dad &apos;s dead , isn &apos;t he ?
well , we should talk about that when your mom &apos;s back .
dead means he &apos;s gone away , doesn &apos;t it ,
and he &apos;s never coming back ?
it does .
i miss him already .
the nurses say you &apos;re refusing your i.v. fluids .
you need them to get your strength back .
there is a reason you survived for so long .
i don &apos;t believe this has to be the end for you .
finally ...
i &apos;m asleep .
they &apos;re always here when i &apos;m asleep .
papa ?
papa !
they found us the next day , but they never found you .
we thought you were gone .
you were gone .
i love you , papa .
there can be beauty in getting lost .
there you are .
grab your stuff . we &apos;re drinking .
oh , i -- i can &apos;t .
i have to go home and deal with --
fight with shepherd ?
i think you need to whine about it some more to me first .
you definitely need to drink .
what are you afraid of , that i &apos;m gonna --
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re gonna keep crawling in my bed
in the middle of the night .
look , yang left me her shares and her board seat
and ... she left me you , too .
it &apos;s just us now .
i don &apos;t know if you need somebody to bitch to or just be ...
my person .
i don &apos;t know what you mean .
but you do .
sometimes , we have to get lost to find each other .
i just don &apos;t know if my marriage can survive this .
my mom asked me to give this to you .
oh , i see .
how did she seem ?
not great .
though , i guess the idea of becoming a grandma
is helping distract her , at least .
that &apos;s right . congratulations .
i &apos;m really happy for you .
thank you .
i &apos;m a little freaked out , to be honest .
i didn &apos;t grow up with much of a dad ,
so kind of working in the dark here .
oh , you &apos;ll be fine , avery .
more than fine .
thank you for returning this .
yeah . sure .
for what it &apos;s worth , sir ...
... it would have been really nice having you in the family .
and sometimes , we find each other ,
only to get lost all over again .
i &apos;m a widow . she widowed me .
i &apos;ll never have alex to myself again .
her best friend just left yesterday , okay ?
she needs someone to talk to . you are overreacting .
she kicked me out of my own bed in the middle of the night ,
while i was naked , and he let her .
okay . so , you &apos;re screwed .
you can &apos;t always control it ,
the thing that &apos;s going to set you adrift ...
i mean , people do it , right ?
it &apos;s not conventional , it &apos;s not easy , but people do it .
i mean , if we can map brains , we can figure this out .
are you trying to convince me or you ?
i mean , i don &apos;t want to split up our family , either ,
but i certainly don &apos;t want to go
and then resent him for the rest of my life .
and that &apos;s what would happen .
and he doesn &apos;t want that , either , so i -- i --
i really just -- i need to go talk to him about this . i --
yeah , well .
hi . what are you doing here ?
i just got off the phone with the white house .
i resigned from the brain mapping initiative .
what ?
i &apos;m not moving to d.c.
why would you do that ?
well , i don &apos;t want to live anywhere else
when my kids are growing up here .
i don &apos;t want to be apart from them , or you .
no job is worth that to me .
i want to be with you and the kids here .
no .
what ?
this is not what we discussed .
i mean , you should call them back
and tell them you were kidding .
i got to pee .
i did not ask you to do this . i never wanted you --
i know you didn &apos;t . i chose .
i chose you and the kids .
... and as you stand there on your front porch ,
staring at the life you &apos;re about to leave behind ...
i need a drink .
... you have to accept it &apos;s gone ,
it &apos;s lost , just like you .
all you can do now is stand very still ...
... breathe in the moment , and try to be open
to wherever the wind &apos;s going to take you next .
tequila .
tequila .
