第七季 第二十一集
It's a terrible thing
when someone loses their moral compass.
It starts with a small infraction,
something insignificant.
Then it's followed by two more infractions
because the first one has long been expected as justified.
Then, like a pyramid scheme of moral laxity,
the lies become misdemeanors,
the misdemeanors become felonies,
and the felonies become a way of life.
And that brings us to the defendant,
Governor Peter Florrick.
It also brings us to his enablers,
his campaign manager, Eli Gold,
and-- I'm sorry to say--
his wife, Alicia Florrick.
Now, Mrs. Florrick will be sitting behind her husband
every day in court.
In this way, the defense wants you to think warmly
of Governor Florrick.
Huh, if his wife stands beside him,
he can't be that bad.
Well, I want you to resist that temptation,
and I will give you a good reason.
Alicia Florrick is part of a criminal conspiracy...
Objection, Your Honor,
Mrs. Florrick is not on trial.
I didn't say she was on trial,
I said you were cynically using her presence...
Excuse me, you just accused her of criminal conspiracy.
If anyone is being cynical...
Excuse me, Your Honor, this is my opening argument
and the defense attorney will have her chance...
What is cynical, sir, is to point to a wife
who has stood by her husband for years.
And if she were not here,
you would point to that as suspicious.
Your Honor...
No, I'm gonna let you two burn yourselves out, okay?
Is there anything else? Are you done, Ms. Lockhart?
I am, Your Honor.
As you know, I came late to this case.
As you pointedly keep reminding us
over and over and over. Do you see this?
‭And do you see the hash mark that you have there?
Yes.
Okay, every time
one of you provokes a round of crosstalk,
you get a mark, and whoever has
the most at the end of the day will be held
in contempt and fined $10,000.
Now, isn't that fun?
Well, it is... unusual.
Okay.
Good. Let's continue.
He hates me.
He has for years.
I know.
This is not gonna be a cakewalk.
I got a call around 2:00 a.M.
that my son had been involved in a shooting.
I thought at first he was the one who'd been shot,
but they said he was the shooter.
And who was he accused of shooting?
His girlfriend, Patty Tanniston.
And what did you do when you heard about this?
I went to see Peter Florrick.
He was state's attorney at the time
and my friend.
You are a campaign donor of Mr. Florrick's, is that right?
Yes.
Hmm. What did you ask him?
I told him I didn't want my son going to jail.
I couldn't imagine he'd done it, but
the evidence was against him.
And what did Mr. Florrick say?
He said, "Lloyd..."
..."you know how much I count on your support.
You have nothing to worry about."
And you took this to mean?
Exactly what it sounded like--
he was going to make the charges go away.
And what happened after that?
Well, two days into Richie's trial,
some evidence went missing.
Bullets that were in the state crime lab.
The judge declared a mistrial.
What did she say?
Nothing.
She said nothing?
What did you ask?
How's the trial?
Did you piss her off?
What? Is that so unlike you?
She's in Mrs. Florrick mode for the trial.
That's all.
So you think he did it?
I don't know.
I think Alicia thinks he didn't,
but if he goes to prison, that wouldn't be bad for you.
Lucca.
What?
Can we give it a rest?
Okay.
I'll shut up, but I speak the truth.
Do you want...? Do you want...?
Do you want us to leave?
Not if you don't mind the dust.
More expansions?
It looks like it.
I never said that. Didn't happen.
Connor knows you won't
put Peter on the stand, so there's no way to rebut.
Okay, well, let's see what I can do, and, uh,
Peter and Alicia,
hold hands, be warm
towards each other. You're being watched.
The jury wants to see you close.
Doing our best.
All right, recess is over.
Counselors, do you have any questions?
Uh, yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Garber, you said you told
Governor Florrick, you couldn't imagine your son had done it,
but the evidence was against him.
Is that right?
Yes.
So, this conversation must have been about the evidence?
I'm sorry?
Well, you said the evidence was against him,
your son, so you must have been discussing the evidence?
Oh. Right.
Good.
And the governor, your friend,
was familiar with the evidence.
He had just reviewed it?
Yes.
So then, when Governor Florrick said,
"You have nothing to worry about,"
doesn't it make more sense that
he meant "I have reviewed the evidence,
and you have nothing to worry about?"
But that's not what he said.
Oh, it's not? Well,
let me read again exactly what you said.
"I couldn't imagine he'd done it,
but the evidence was against him."
And Governor Florrick, your friend,
the friend you are now betraying...
Objection.
Withdrawn. The governor responded after
reviewing the evidence, "You have nothing to worry about."
Sir, why can't the governor's comment, "You have nothing
to worry about" be interpreted as
the calming commiseration of a good friend?
Oh, I see you're looking at Mr. Fox.
Should I ask him?
Objection.
Yeah, sure. Sustained,
but it did look like he was checking with you for the answer.
Should I ask again, Mr. Garber?
No.
It wasn't the commiseration of a friend, and you know it, Peter.
Excuse me, don't talk to my client, sir,
especially since you know he can't talk back.
And enjoy your deal with the AUSA.
Objection! Your Honor.
Yeah, I'm way ahead of you.
Two to one.
Wait. No. How did I get one?
Correction. Two to two.
Eight years.
No.
Okay. Then what else do we have to discuss?
Nothing.
I'll see you in court.
Your husband did it, Mrs. Florrick.
Then prove it.
Seriously.
I've defended enough people
to know how shallow those words are.
I don't care what you believe.
I care what you can prove, so prove it.
I have a surprise witness, Mrs. Florrick.
Hey. What's up?
Oh, not much.
I'm being made into the evil woman here.
Is that Alicia?
I need your help.
The AUSA is holding at eight years.
He says he has a surprise witness.
Can you find anything out?
Sure. You think it's Cary?
Maybe.
I'll talk to Canning.
But anything you can find out would be helpful.
I'll do my best.
How are you doing?
Me? I don't know.
I'm exhausted.
Where are you? Are you... are you at a construction site?
The conference room.
The wall is mostly down.
The wall? What wall?
The conference room wall.
Not at Lockhart/Florrick.
It is a pure meritocracy-- where the women decide.
So come, talk to us, visit us, let us impress you.
Excuse me. It's my partner.
Hey. Is everything all right?
I don't know.
Are we expanding?
Um, well, yes.
I'm meeting right now with Shannon Janderman.
I think she's gonna jump ship.
Well, don't you think
it would have been a good idea to let me know?
Well, what do you mean? We did discuss this.
I have meetings all week. I can't cancel them
because of the trial.
No, no, no, the construction.
What construction?
Oh, my God!
How could the...?
Where is David?
How could he let this happen?
*Pestilential nuisances who write for autographs*
*All people who have flabby hands and irritating laughs...*
They had the wrong floor.
Law firm on the 18th is expanding.
Oh, my God. What do we do?
I called the insurance.
We're covered.
I have Shannon Janderman
coming over tomorrow to impress her.
Well, we'll use the conference room
on the 27th floor.
Uh, the paralegals are in there.
Okay, we'll think of something.
Diane, we have to get back to court.
There's another possibility.
What's that?
We expand to the 29th floor.
What?
We want to expand and hire more lawyers.
The 29th floor is empty.
That equity firm went bankrupt.
Yes.
But we should expand because
we decide to expand, not because
someone accidentally destroyed our conference room.
Why not?
Matan Brody, Assistant State's Attorney in Cook County.
You were the lead prosecutor in the Richard Locke case?
With Cary Agos, that's correct.
Would you say Peter Florrick micromanaged this case?
I would.
And in what way did he do that?
Well, for one, he came to the crime scene.
He did? On the night of the murder?
Yes.
Is that unusual?
I've worked with four SA's in 11 years.
First time I'd ever seen it.
So as the crime scene was being processed, Peter was there?
Yes. He asked a lot of questions, he worried
about their methods, their experience, he had us review
911 calls earlier in the week.
And did this behavior continue?
Yes, through prep, right up until trial.
Even the charging decision.
We could've gone for first degree murder,
but he barely let us go for second.
Thank you, Mr. Brody.
The murder of Ms. Tanniston happened just two weeks
after Governor Florrick assumed office.
Is that correct?
Yes, I believe so.
And this was Governor Florrick's second stint as state's attorney
after the corruption charges against him
had been thrown out?
Yes.
So, showing up at a crime scene,
making sure evidence is collected properly--
couldn't that be the action of a re-elected state's attorney
wanting to ensure the-the highest standards?
It could be, but it wasn't here.
I see.
How many gun felony charges were thrown out
under the previous state's attorney, Glenn Childs?
I don't know.
625.
That's over 12%.
Do you know how many were thrown out under Peter Florrick?
Mr. Florrick was in office for fewer years.
Well, I'm glad you're making your bias evident.
29 cases were thrown out, sir.
That's fewer than two percent.
So it seems that Peter Florrick's
micromanagement was needed.
It wasn't needed.
Objection. Argumentative.
Our department had double the prosecutions
before Peter Florrick.
Of course you had double the prosecutions
because you didn't care about the rule of law.
Your Honor, I'm objecting here. This is not a debate.
That is such defense attorney crap.
Alicia.
You're looking good.
Thank you, so are you.
You staying out of trouble?
Trying.
You seem to be drawing a lot of interest.
It happens when your husband's on trial.
So, is Cary testifying against Peter?
Let me ask you a question,
is Peter scapegoating Cary?
No.
Then no.
So we're linked?
Well, you don't go after Cary,
I have no reason to go after Peter.
Good.
Then that's that.
Not really.
You have a problem.
Peter is guilty.
I have to get back to court, Mr. Canning.
Thank you.
The AUSA has proof.
They have a witness who's not on the list.
How do you know that?
Because she approached us. She wanted to know
what Cary was gonna say.
She? Who's she?
Geneva Pine.
If she testifies, Peter goes to prison.
What can she say?
Everything.
What the hell?
David, where have you been?
When people come off the elevator,
I want them to think of wings.
Flight. Eagles. Soaring eagles.
What the freaking hell?
Workmen accidentally destroyed the conference room.
Now we're thinking of leasing the 29th floor
and building a staircase to it.
Not a staircase.
A stair presentation.
Who's he?
Irv Bircher. I designed your offices,
now I want to bring them
into the 21st century.
This is the 21st century.
No, you're deluding yourself.
Pale wood, glass.
This is an Apple store, circa 2009.
That is the 21st century.
Jason.
I need to ask a favor.
Well, actually not a favor.
I can pay.
I'm sorry.
No, I-I just mean...
I don't know how this should work.
It's for Peter.
Yes.
Just ask me a favor.
Geneva Pine.
Canning says she's testifying,
but she wasn't the prosecutor on the case,
and we need to know what she knows.
And what to use against her.
Yeah.
I'm on it.
I'm sorry.
I have to finish this with Peter.
Alicia, you don't have to apologize.
I can't get my head around what you said.
Which part?
The not wanting to get stuck,
but wanting to be together.
I don't know how to reconcile those two.
I know.
I need time.
I'm not someone who likes being untethered.
Come back up with me.
I should get to work.
Later?
Yeah.
So who do you want to know about?
库克县助理检察官
I know all the dirt in the SA's office.
Geneva Pine.
What do you want to know?
I need anything out of the ordinary,
anything that I can use.
You want some turkey sandwich?
No thanks, I ate.
So, here's the thing,
the state's attorney's office is like a big ole family,
with a mama, and a papa, and a whole lot of children.
Who's the papa?
Peter Florrick.
At the time.
And the mama?
Geneva Pine.
That's why she had access to all the cases.
She was sleeping with him.
She was sleeping with Peter Florrick?
Yup.
Long time affair. From what I hear,
she was sleeping with him up to a month ago.
That's why she's testifying.
He broke it off with her.
Can you use that?
Geneva Pine.
I work in the state's attorney's office.
And you worked under Peter Florrick?
Yes.
And did you interrogate Mr. Locke
on the night of the shooting?
I did.
Can you tell me
about this interview?
Mr. Locke was upset.
He kept saying he loved his girlfriend,
that he wished things had happened differently.
Differently?
Um, what-what did he mean by that?
It felt like he was about to confess.
Did he have an attorney with him?
No, he hadn't asked for one yet.
But he did later?
Yes.
After Peter showed up
and interrupted Mr. Locke
and asked if I had Mirandized him.
Had you?
No,
because I wasn't questioning Mr. Locke.
Is that standard practice?
If we arrest someone, it's a custodial interrogation,
and we read them their rights.
If we show up, and they want to tell us
about the crime they committed, we don't stop them.
But Peter Florrick made you.
He did,
and then Richard Locke clammed up.
Lawyered up.
Tell me, um, what are these?
The four bullets recovered from the crime scene.
These two were taken from the wall behind Patty Tanniston.
These two were recovered from her body.
I see, these were the ones that killed her.
Yes.
And you helped supervise
the ballistic testing for these bullets.
Was there a conclusion to this testing?
Yes, they were fired
from a Glock 26 owned by Mr. Locke, the defendant.
That seems like pretty damning evidence.
Why weren't they used at trial?
They were used.
But before the defense had the chance to test the bullets,
they were lost.
Which caused the mistrial.
Yes.
I thought we should conduct a top-to-bottom search
for the bullets.
And what did Mr. Florrick say?
He said he would take it under advisement.
And did he?
No.
Nothing more at the moment, Your Honor.
Counselor, I imagine you want your usual moment to consult.
Yes, just one second, Your Honor.
Sure, I'm made of nothing but time.
我们需要谈谈
I'm only doing this because our fates are tied.
Doing what?
Helping.
As long as you keep Cary out of it and don't point fingers,
I got your back.
Really?
That I'd like to see.
Geneva Pine is lying.
Is that what those say?
No, these just give the motive.
What's that?
She was a spurned lover.
These are affidavits from coworkers saying
that Peter Florrick broke off an affair with her.
Got it. Good. Thanks.
You heard what I just said?
Yes.
Were you wanting me to cry, Mr. Canning?
Oh, my God.
I thought my husband
no longer cheated.
God, I love you.
I know.
She was a good witness.
The jury believed her.
I know, so how can we undercut her?
I can argue that Peter was being diligent,
but that doesn't undercut the crime lab failure.
Could you go after her reputation?
I don't think she has an issue
with the Disciplinary Commission.
Go to motive.
What do you mean?
No one else heard Peter reject the search of the crime lab.
Only Geneva.
You think she's lying?
I think you can make a case she's lying.
How?
She was sleeping with Peter.
These are affidavits from coworkers
saying Peter broke up with her.
And she's trying to get back at him.
Goes to motive.
How did you get these?
Canning.
Well, that was, uh,
Chief Justice Bennett.
He's going to look into her background
and see if we can use anything.
What?
What are those?
They are affidavits from Geneva's coworkers
saying that she's lying
because you broke up with her after having a long affair.
What?
They are affidavits from coworkers.
You have people saying that Geneva and I had an affair?
Yes, and that she's lying because she wants to hurt you.
That's not true.
Why don't we step out?
No.
It's not true, we can't use them.
We'll just give you a minute.
Just use it, Peter.
No.
I don't know what's in those affidavits,
but there was nothing between Geneva and me.
If you're worried about embarrassing me...
I'm not worried about anything, Alicia.
When people think bad things of you,
they keep thinking bad things.
What you have here
is office gossip.
Who got it for you?
Your investigator?
No.
Well, I'm not gonna use it.
Be careful, this one's got a...
It's got a little bit of a kick to it.
God, I look good with a gun.
What do you need?
Uh, something that's difficult for you.
I need you on the stand.
Florrick trial?
Yeah, I read your ballistics report.
It's deliberately impenetrable.
I needed another test,
but they lost the bullets before I could.
Yes, but to withhold an opinion,
you have to have an opinion.
Opinions are nothing without science behind it.
No, you're an expert witness.
If your opinion rises out of your expertise,
that's something.
You don't usually play this game.
I know. My client's being railroaded.
He's not being "Railroaded."
He's a Democratic governor
being judged by a Democratic jury.
That's as far from "Railroaded" as you can get.
I'm not asking you to lie.
I'm just...
asking you to give your preliminary opinion.
In a manner that is helpful to my defense.
Please, Kurt.
Help me?
You were the ballistics expert hired by the SA's office
to assess these bullets?
That is correct.
Now, I should get something out of the way,
right up front.
I'm questioning because you
are related to a lawyer on our defense team.
Yes, I'm married to Diane Lockhart.
Congratulations.
Thank you, Your Honor.
But this marriage happened after
the ballistics testing you did for the SA's office?
Yes. Did you give Governor Florrick
a preliminary report on these bullets
before they disappeared?
Objection!
Your Honor, this trial has nothing to do
with Locke's guilt.
This is about Peter Florrick.
Yes, and we are offering
Mr. McVeigh's testimony
to show Governor Florrick's state of mind.
His state of mind is irrelevant here.
It-it's his action...
Governor Florrick had no reason to lose these bullets
if he thought they proved Locke's innocence.
In fact, it would be against his interest...
Your Honor, this is circular...
I'll allow.
He likes her.
Mr. McVeigh?
As a respected ballistics expert,
who has worked for the SA's office for ten years--
what was your determination about these bullets?
Well, I should say that my findings were preliminary.
But from what I saw,
these bullets did not come from Mr. Locke's gun.
Pardon our dust.
Pardon our noise.
Yeah, the world has changed.
People don't look
for the same thing in a law firm.
They look for a personality.
Which is what we want to supply--
an all-service firm
with a female perspective.
Diane, sorry to interrupt.
Uh, the Coleman divorce, the bitch is on the line.
She wants to talk to both of us.
David, what is your problem?
My problem?
Yes, there is no Coleman divorce.
My problem is I'm an equity partner.
You're spending my money.
No, I'm spending our money.
There was a vote.
A vote in a dictatorship is not a vote.
It was a fair vote.
With women outnumbering men.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry, David.
The women outnumber the men.
That must be so hard for you.
It's not only hard, it's discriminatory.
Oh, come on, you know what we were doing.
You've been on a hiring binge,
and how many men have you interviewed?
How many male lawyers have you met with?
I have met with men.
Watch it, Diane.
There's a discriminatory suit in your future.
This is an affidavit from a coworker of Geneva Pine.
He says that Geneva often
bullied her way into other cases.
That's it? Nothing else?
Nope.
Just time and dates
and she had some issues with back taxes.
Nothing about her sleeping with Peter?
Nothing I could confirm independently.
Did you try to confirm it independently?
I'm just...
I'm in a awkward position here.
I know.
And I think I'm done.
What does that mean?
I can't be doing this for your husband anymore.
Investigating.
We'll talk after the trial.
Okay.
You're a student of Mr. McVeigh's?
Yes, for four years.
And you were asked to review Mr. McVeigh's work in his case?
Yes.
Diane?
Who is she?
Kurt's favorite.
Whatever that means.
And what did you find?
Well, it was quite preliminary.
Mr. McVeigh has only conducted
one chemical analysis on the bullets.
And as Kurt said, before he could make
a more thorough examination,
the bullets went missing.
Did you find any deficiency in his analysis?
Objection-- calls for speculation.
Your Honor, as the defense pointed out,
this is not about whether Locke is innocent or guilty.
This is about Peter's state of mind.
And therefore, Mr. McVeigh's work
and how it was presented
to Peter has a great bearing on this trial.
But Mr. McVeigh had actual access to the bullets.
Ms. Westfall does not...
Oh, come on, you do not get to benefit
from your client's destruction of evidence!
Objection-- that mischaracterizes the testimony here.
‭Okay. You both get a hash mark.
Overruled, Ms. Lockhart.
You can't have it both ways!
Thank you, Your Honor.
Uh, do you need me to repeat the question?
No, I'm good.
I don't find any deficiencies
in Mr. McVeigh's analysis of the bullets.
I do find that he, um--
how shall I say this--
oversold
his results in court.
Uh, it is very easy to get a false negative
in gas chromatography,
and I think he may have downplayed that here.
Are you suggesting
that Mr. McVeigh is lying here, Ms. Westfall?
No, Kurt is one of the most honest people I know.
I...
I do think he had reason to spin his results.
I think that's fair,
given the make-up of the defense team.
Nothing further, Your Honor.
Ms. Westfall, even if what you say is true--
Mr. McVeigh oversold his conclusions here--
there's no reason to believe that
he didn't equally oversell them to Governor Florrick?
Well, I can't speak to that.
All I can say is that Kurt always tells the truth.
But this isn't about Mr. McVeigh.
This is about Governor Florrick's state of mind.
And if Governor Florrick heard the same thing from Mr. McVeigh
that we heard here,
he would have no reason to destroy those bullets.
I guess that's true.
One last question.
When you've worked for the SA's office,
did the state's attorney ever handle evidence?
Evidence like these bullets?
No, never, it was always the prosecutor.
So Matan?
No,
the co-prosecutor handled the evidence, uh...
Cary Agos.
We didn't do that.
We did not point the finger at Cary.
And who did?
It was your lawyer.
Tell Cary we're on the same side.
Well, we were...
until about ten minutes ago.
Mr. Agos, did you ever discuss with Governor Florrick
the ballistics results in the Locke case?
Yes, I did.
And what was the nature of that discussion?
That the bullets connected Locke to the crime
and the murder weapon.
Mr. McVeigh suggested here that
he was cautious in his analysis about the bullets.
Yes, he was.
But that's his way.
We knew the bullets damned Peter.
You-you mean Locke?
Yes, my apologies-- Locke.
Mr. Agos?
Do you hate the Florricks?
No.
But don't you have reason to be angry with the Florricks?
Yes.
Yes.
You do.
So then why should this court take your testimony seriously?
Because I'm telling the truth.
As you see it?
Yes, of course.
That's all I have to offer here.
The truth as I see it.
You didn't have to do that, Cary.
I never meant you any harm.
You know, it's amazing, Alicia.
After all these years working together,
you still think I would come in here into a court of law
and perjure myself to hurt you.
I was here to tell the truth.
What are you here to do?
I need to take the stand.
They want to hear from me.
They need to hear from me.
Because I seem like a coward.
You don't. You seem smart.
The prosecution could rip you apart on cross.
I think the jury's against me.
What do you think?
I think you're right.
I need to testify.
Diane?
I don't know.
We should prep.
See how you do.
You look grumpy.
Nope.
This is my happy face.
Peter's in trouble.
I think he might go to prison.
You don't sound that upset about it.
He's your client.
Hey, I'm trying my best.
But the facts just aren't cooperating.
How's Alicia?
A rock.
But if he goes to prison,
she'll need a lot of comforting.
Here's what you don't understand about Alicia.
He goes to prison?
She'll never divorce him.
Ever.
I disagree.
Because you think things are logical.
She will visit him every week in prison.
She will slowly drift away from me.
And she will be the stoic spouse.
And if he doesn't go to prison?
She'll divorce him.
And which do you want?
Because
here's something you don't seem to understand about yourself.
You may play the game of being this hard-bitten--
or is it hard-boiled?
One of the hards.
When you, in fact,
have fallen in love.
Tell me it's not true.
And I'll leave you here drinking.
All by your lonesome.
It's not true.
I don't believe you.
And take my advice.
Stop playing it cool.
You want her?
Go to her and say,
"I want you.
"And I'll protect you.
"You don't owe your husband anything.
"Be happy.
"Come to me.
Make me happy."
Kurt...
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I will make you happy every day of your life,
but please forgive me.
Please.
Lloyd Garber donated $5,000
to your PAC in 2009, is that correct?
That's correct.
But in 2013,
a year after Richard Locke's mistrial,
Lloyd Garber's donations quadrupled.
Can you explain?
I cannot.
Lloyd Garber and I never discussed money.
There was no tit for tat?
"You get my son off for murder
and I'll increase my financial support"?
I-I believe I already answered that question.
No. Too belligerent.
You're the governor.
Be dignified.
He's going to ask it,
and he's going to ask it more than once.
There was no tit for tat.
There were never any strings or conditions
attached to Lloyd Garber's, or anyone else's, contributions.
As a man who was convicted
of using state funds to pay for prostitutes,
why should we take your word for anything?
My attorney would object to that.
And Judge Cuesta overrules.
My conviction was overturned
and I was fully exonerated.
So are you saying that you never paid for prostitutes?
Never cheated on your wife?
Haven't broken every promise you've ever made?
It goes to character.
To your trustworthiness.
I believe I've been up front about this.
I did pay for prostitutes, I did cheat on my wife,
and I have worked every day
to make up for those indiscretions.
So would you agree...
I'm not finished.
And that is one of the reasons why,
when I was voted back into office,
I spent every day trying to make sure
there was not a single bad conviction.
Because I saw what bad convictions did to families,
did to me,
did to my wife.
And I swore that I would never
let that ever happen again.
Is that true?
Yes, Counselor, that is true.
It's also true that I micromanaged this case.
Guilty.
But that's what you should want
from a state's attorney.
Someone who won't accept excuses
for a failure to Mirandize
or allow for bad evidence collection.
Someone who loses bullets?
That was just a mistake.
You say that you have worked
hard every day to make up for
the indiscretions of the past...
but we have evidence
that you were having a longtime affair
with not only a fellow prosecutor...
We would object here.
Yes, and Judge Cuesta doesn't like you. He would allow.
At what point are we playing husband and wife here,
and at what point lawyers?
All points.
Because here's the thing:
you get up on that stand,
and every past indiscretion
will be determined admissible.
Your sleeping with Geneva Pine.
I didn't sleep
with Geneva...
Your sleeping with Marilyn Garbanza.
I didn't sleep with...
Your sleeping with Ramona Lytton.
And you sleeping with Will Gardner
and you sleeping with your investigator!
I'm not on trial, buddy.
Are you saying you didn't sleep with Geneva Pine?
That's exactly what I'm saying.
And these prostitutes, you never slept with any of them, either?
I believe I've already admitted to that.
Oh, well, good, good,
at least you admitted to that.
That makes it okay, then.
Objection.
What I don't understand is what this has to do
with my performance as the state's attorney.
Because your performance is directly connected
to your actions before and after.
You said yourself you learned from your mistakes,
that's why you were such a diligent S.A.
Objection, Your Honor. Where is the question?
Here it is.
You have lied so much, Mr. Florrick,
why should any of us ever believe you again?
Because I went to prison.
Because I was wrongly convicted.
I didn't ask for a speech...
You asked a question.
I'm answering it.
Am I a flawed individual?
Yes.
Have I done things in my personal life that I regret?
Yes, deeply.
But I never wanted anyone
to go through what I went through
and that is why I was a hard-ass state's attorney.
That's why I threw out bad confessions.
That's why I micromanaged.
But that's when I was at my best.
That's when I was most honorable.
The 12 of you should give fair
and equal consideration to all the evidence
and deliberate with the goal of reaching an agreement.
Your sole interest
is to determine whether the government
has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.
Good luck.
Now, the stairs will start here
and expand out as they get higher,
connecting to the north side of the 29th floor...
And it will be all woman,
from the north to the south.
David, just go back to your office.
I will, as soon as you sign this EEOC complaint.
Oh, come on, David.
What? I have just as much right to complain as any minority.
Ms. Lockhart?
Yes.
I'm Greg Cady from the Department of Buildings.
I'm here for a Certificate of Occupancy inspection.
And we've run into an issue of compliance.
Meaning?
Meaning somebody on your demolition crew
took out the load-bearing wall for the 29th floor.
They did?
Yes.
Does that mean our new floor could come
crashing down on our heads?
Yes.
You're kidding.
No, unfortunately.
You'll have to evacuate to the 27th floor.
Uh... when?
Now.
Two years.
I came down from eight. I'm not going lower.
I'd rather see what the jury does.
And you know the jury
will probably do a lot more.
I'll ask him.
If I were you, I'd do a lot more than ask.
Take it to him.
And sell it.
Before the jury comes back.
We're not giving up.
We're working different angles.
Mike Tascioni found a criminal case
against an S.A. In DuPage County
in '98 that was thrown out.
He thinks we can mine it for a precedent.
Eli, can you give us a minute?
Yes, of course. I'm so sorry.
Can I make a confession to you?
Sure.
I never liked wine.
I only drank it 'cause you liked it.
I was always a Scotch guy.
I guess I inherited that from my father.
Well, I can fix you a Scotch.
No.
It's grown on me.
Two years.
Oh, God...
I was in there for only eight months
and almost died.
Wait for the verdict, Peter.
I do that,
I may actually die in prison.
Ten years.
What did you think of the jury?
I think they were judging us.
But I think your speech at the end went over well.
I was always good with a speech.
There's no good answer, is there?
I don't know what to say.
I'm not good at gambling.
Don't decide yet, Peter.
The jury's retired.
Just... sleep on it.
I'm gonna take the deal.
It's the smart thing to do.
Two years.
I'll get out,
write a book, start over.
Are you gonna come visit me?
I will.
The hardest thing is being forgotten.
I won't forget.
Okay.
What?
The jury's back.
