please .
no ! no !
no !
no ! uhh !
no . no . no .
no !
maura isles , you are brilliant !
oh , i like the sound of that .
oh ... my .
it &apos;s great , right ?
oh , you were so right .
about what ?
oh , don &apos;t be modest . this is all you .
i can &apos;t believe i didn &apos;t listen to you sooner .
i &apos;m not sure what it is you think i said ,
but i am fairly certain
that there &apos;s been a miscommunication .
no , no , no , no , no . come on .
all the nagging that you did about how i should ...
change up my wardrobe , shake it up ?
well , i took your advice .
well , i just meant you should expand your wardrobe a little .
yes !
and i can &apos;t stop doing this !
okay , well , it &apos;s a bold choice .
mm ! and the jacket &apos;s just the beginning .
what do you think about overalls ?
still avoiding calls from our father , are we ?
i do not have time to chat .
i thought you were gonna talk to him .
yes , i thought i was , too .
when &apos;s he leave ?
saturday . but he wants to get together tonight , have dinner ,
go over some paperwork for the family trust .
mm . good . you guys can finally talk , get it all out .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m helping . what time works for you ?
that is not helping .
you can do this , maura .
i wouldn &apos;t even know where to start .
okay , well , how about , uh ,
&quot; you cheated on my mom and then made me lie about it ,
which sucked &quot; ?
that sums it up nicely .
yeah , but what good would it really do ?
i mean , so much time has passed .
yeah , but you &apos;re still carrying it around inside .
so you could just get it out and tell him how you feel .
wait . you &apos;re one to talk .
you don &apos;t tell anyone how you feel .
well , i &apos;ll tell you how i feel right now .
i feel that you should do this ...
or you &apos;re gonna be avoiding him forever .
that is a statement , not a feeling .
doesn &apos;t make it any less true . rizzoli .
‭ isles .
do you wanna borrow my jacket ?
yeah , put it on and go like this .
makes you feel incredible , like you could do anything .
like shoot targets while riding a horse ?
yes , and solve crimes .
yes . no , that sounds terrible .
no , i &apos;m here . we &apos;ll be right there .
第六季 第九集
so don &apos;t make it a dinner with your father .
do something casual .
my father and i don &apos;t do casual .
well , maybe you should start .
you know , just meet , talk . baby steps .
nice jacket .
mm , it was all maura &apos;s idea .
i never mentioned fringe .
victim &apos;s at the bottom of the hill .
thank you , sergeant .
you messing with her ?
yeah .
i &apos;m making a point ,
but it &apos;s always so much more fun to amuse myself while i do it .
what do we got ?
well , hikers found him this morning .
appears to have fallen from up top .
ow . yeah .
he was hard to see . the body was behind those rocks .
the victim was a student over at state .
stuart crane .
only thing he had on him
was his student i.d. and keys .
no cash , no credit cards . no cell phone .
robbery ?
possible .
c.s.r.u. &apos; s up top . they haven &apos;t found much .
prescott trail is real popular . there &apos;s footprints everywhere .
any witnesses ?
not so far .
part of the cliff &apos;s broken away .
you can see where he tried to get himself up .
must &apos;ve lost his grip .
crime techs found these .
maura , anything interesting ?
there are signs of rigor mortis on the jaw and hands .
i &apos;d estimate the time of death to be about ...
three to four hours ago .
around sunrise .
abrasions and bruising are consistent with a fall .
might &apos;ve slipped . still pretty dark around dawn .
except there are two wounds in the back of the skull
that resulted in a severely depressed fracture .
they appear too similar
to be from a random fall .
you think somebody hit him with something ?
i can &apos;t be certain yet .
the wounds have abraded margins ,
which could &apos;ve been caused by something dense
or blows that were delivered with tremendous pressure .
frankie , have c.s.r.u. pay close attention to the rocks up top .
blood trace would be easy to miss .
guess i &apos;ll be getting my cardio for the week .
there &apos;s unusual trauma to the fingers and hands .
unusual how ?
well , the bones in the fingertips
appear to be broken .
broken fingers and a cracked skull ?
doesn &apos;t sound much like a robbery .
sounds like he pissed somebody off .
like , dead dead ?
i &apos;m afraid so .
you two close ?
i barely know the guy .
you were roommates .
well , no offense , but dude &apos;s super boring .
yeah , he &apos;s like an english major or somethin &apos; .
any idea why he was up at prescott trail
early this morning ?
well , he usually takes off before the sun &apos;s up .
did he have any problems with anyone ?
you know , arguments or fights ?
not that i ever heard about .
do you mind telling me how you got that shiner ?
oh , i bodychecked a forward at hockey practice this morning .
it &apos;s nice , huh ?
wallet &apos;s here -- debit card , cash .
so it probably wasn &apos;t robbery .
i &apos;m gonna get this phone to nina ,
see if she can unlock it .
it &apos;s weird that he didn &apos;t have it with him .
most college kids ,
it &apos;s like they have them permanently attached .
have a feeling he &apos;s not like most college kids .
first edition &quot; don juan . &quot; lord byron .
probably worth a couple thousand dollars .
no way .
couple thousand bucks for a book ?
you know , like , just read it online , right ?
yeah . right .
thank you .
go talk to some of the other kids in this dorm .
they can &apos;t all be knuckleheads .
these are spiral fractures .
the twisting pattern is caused by pressure being exerted
by a moving object .
like someone was stepping on his fingers ?
that would account for the pattern .
in fact , i believe it &apos;s likely that the damage was done
by a rubber @-@ soled hiking boot .
dr. isles , are you actually speculating
about how this damage was inflicted ?
i don &apos;t need to speculate . i have science .
specifically ...
i have gaussian filters that can isolate dust particles .
i also found trace amounts of thermoplastic polyurethane
on the skin ,
which is a synthetic rubber commonly found on hiking boots .
you really do love showing off your toys , don &apos;t cha ?
i do .
i get it .
now the cause of death
is the trauma to the back of the skull .
two blows from the same dense object
from different angles .
the second blow was delivered
from a much higher vantage point .
so unless our killer had a sudden growth spurt ,
stuart fell , and then the killer hit him again .
that would correlate to my findings .
okay . thanks , maura .
26 . 27 . no , 28 .
what &apos;s up ?
oh , you &apos;re not gonna believe this .
29 .
no way .
30 .
what &apos;s going on ?
nina unlocks stuart &apos;s phone , and it &apos;s weird --
there &apos;s no email , no calendar programs , no apps ,
but there &apos;s a lot of texts .
31 .
now that &apos;s just greedy .
31 what ?
women .
what ?
not just women . girlfriends .
32 .
stuart crane had 32 girlfriends ?
stuart wasn &apos;t just reading &quot; don juan . &quot;
the guy was don juan .
it &apos;s hard to believe he had so many girlfriends .
stuart doesn &apos;t seem like the type .
some of these texts are sweet .
&quot; before i met you , i never knew what it was like
to think of someone and smile for absolutely no reason . &quot;
seriously ? sounds like a cheesy greeting card .
i &apos;d buy that card .
i would , too . anything else interesting ?
so far , the conversations are what you &apos;d expect .
&quot; how was your day ? i miss you . &quot;
this woman is really into kittens .
he tells her all the time how much he loves them . mnh @-@ mnh .
so basically , he just tells them what they wanna hear .
anybody talk to him about meeting this morning ?
not that i found yet .
as far as i can tell , he never met up
with any of the women he was dating .
and none of them seem to be from the college .
maybe he met them online .
maybe , but i didn &apos;t find anything like that
on his computer .
he only used this cell for chatting with his girlfriends ,
nothing with friends or family ,
which makes me think he has a second phone .
c.s.r.u. didn &apos;t find one at the crime scene .
can you check with other service providers
and see if you can find something ?
frankie , can you go back to the dorm room ,
see if you can find the phone ?
yeah .
stuart crane &apos;s mother lives in ohio .
he has a sister over in hartford . she &apos;s driving in now .
hey , look at this .
&quot; contact my wife again , and you &apos;re a dead man . &quot;
there &apos;s a whole series of these .
who &apos;s donovan ?
that &apos;s stuart &apos;s middle name .
he used it with all his girlfriends .
&quot; you homewrecking asshole . i &apos;ll cut off your -- &quot;
ooh ! that &apos;s some colorful language .
definitely not medically advisable .
well , let &apos;s get a name and address .
yeah , let &apos;s go see if he still has his ...
unbelievable .
that bastard had the nerve to call the cops on me .
you sent some pretty threatening messages .
you said you &apos;d kill him in some pretty creative ways .
i was upset . wouldn &apos;t you be if you found out
your wife had some secret boyfriend ?
sure . i might even be mad enough to confront the jerk ,
knock him around a little bit . is that how you felt ?
i wanted him to stop contacting heather .
i told you , honey , we were just texting .
it didn &apos;t mean anything .
if donovan has a problem ,
he should talk to me about it in person .
you have two convictions of disorderly conduct .
you got a temper ?
i &apos;m done with your questions .
well , that &apos;s too bad &apos; cause we &apos;re not done asking .
why don &apos;t we go downtown ? you might feel better
about answering these questions down there .
or you could just tell us where you were
from 5 : 00 to 6 : 00 this morning .
why do you need to know where i ...
was this guy killed or something ?
because i &apos;ve never even met him .
then you won &apos;t mind answering the questions .
between 5 : 00 and 6 : 00 , i was working .
i pulled a double . plenty of people saw me .
this is ridiculous .
rick couldn &apos;t have killed donovan .
donovan &apos;s not even real .
excuse me ?
he &apos;s just an app .
an app ?
you &apos;re kidding .
i @-@ it &apos;s called yourperfectmate .
you sign up , and they give you a virtual boyfriend .
it &apos;s like a computer or something .
you &apos;ve been texting with a robot ?
he tells me i look pretty every day ,
and you &apos;re never home . i ...
i just wanted you to get a little jealous .
looks like stuart upgraded his image .
rick matthews &apos; alibi checked out .
witnesses saw him at work at the time of the murder .
i finished reading all the other texts .
nothing suspicious , but i &apos;m still running backgrounds .
did frankie track down the owners of yourperfectmate ?
yeah . crane &apos;s been employed there for the last six months .
he handled up to 40 clients at a time .
any problems ?
they said he was a model employee .
您的兴趣 水上运动 马驹 计算机
are you in the market for a fake boyfriend ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s come to that yet .
i just wanna vet the app ,
see if any obvious security flaws pop out .
okay , so what do you do ?
you pick the kind of guy you like ?
yeah . you answer questions about what you like --
age , hobbies , interests .
i said i like horses .
i could see you on a ranch .
right ?
yeah .
so it &apos;s down to polo player or cowboy .
mm , cowboy , of course .
like that &apos;s even a real choice .
looks like they saved the most important for last --
funny or romantic ?
well , you can &apos;t have both .
let &apos;s go with funny .
so we hit &quot; meet my new boyfriend , &quot;
and ... ooh ! hello , winston .
there &apos;s somebody you could have a beer with .
any luck on the second phone ?
i found a number registered in crane &apos;s name .
tried to call it , but the phone &apos;s powered off .
frankie recanvassed the crime scene and the dorm
but didn &apos;t find the phone itself .
did you subpoena the carrier for the phone records ?
yeah . still waiting .
if ...
oh , it &apos;s from winston .
&quot; i &apos;d ri-- &quot;
oh , winston &apos;s a bit naughty .
god , i love cowboys .
who doesn &apos;t ?
this is the last time that we were out together .
over the summer .
you and your brother were close ?
stuart was the man of the family .
he was the youngest ,
but he always knew what to say to make us feel better .
do you know if he had any issues at school ?
no . being broke would probably be his biggest problem .
he was paying his own way through college .
that &apos;s why he started working for that , um ...
computer boyfriend thing .
yourperfectmate .
we joked about it ...
how growing up with four women was perfect training .
he enjoyed it ...
at least until they stopped paying him .
he hadn &apos;t been paid ?
no , not in weeks .
did he say why ?
the owners had promised funding was coming in ,
but i told stuart it sounded like
they were just stringing him along .
what made you think that ?
i don &apos;t know .
the app has a lot of problems .
there was this one woman who had this crazy husband
who wrote terrible things to stuart .
i think we talked to him .
but it wasn &apos;t the first time
that something like this had happened .
did he have problems with other clients ?
yeah .
but stuart needed the money , so he put up with it .
do you think that stuart getting killed
had something to do with the app ?
i mean , he just said nice things to people .
why would somebody wanna hurt him for that ?
we don &apos;t know exactly what happened .
but i promise you , we &apos;ll find out .
maura . i &apos;m so glad you called .
and the park -- wonderful idea .
there &apos;s a barista who makes a bracing espresso .
can i bring you one ?
no , thank you .
so ... routine paperwork .
i &apos;m sorry it needs to be notarized .
that &apos;s fine .
i will have them for you by tomorrow .
that &apos;s fine .
i should get back .
maura ...
can &apos;t we just talk ?
i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t know how to talk to you .
i haven &apos;t since i was 14 .
is this the way it &apos;s always gonna be between us ?
i made a mistake .
i made a terrible mistake .
but your mother and i worked it out .
she forgave me for the affair a long time ago .
why can &apos;t you ?
you never asked me to .
you just ... acted like nothing ever happened .
well , i didn &apos;t know how to talk to you about all that .
well , you never tried .
i was embarrassed .
and i was traumatized ... by you .
i understand how difficult things were ...
no , you don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t , or you would have talked to me about it .
you would have told mom that i know .
you would &apos;ve done something -- something other than
let me carry around this terrible secret
for all these years on my own .
you and your mother never talked about it ?
you asked me not to say anything .
i didn &apos;t .
i was scared that mom would leave
if she knew that you asked me to keep this secret for you .
and ...
despite everything ,
i wanted you to stay together .
i had ...
i had no idea .
you went off to boarding school . i was out of the country .
so you thought things would get better
because we were on different continents ?
of course not .
so how exactly was that supposed to help ?
i thought things would get easier with time .
they didn &apos;t . they got worse .
your secret became my secret .
after all these years ...
maura ...
i am grieved that you suffered for my stupidity .
it is the one thing in my life i most regret .
and if i could go back in time and change things ,
i &apos;d do that in a heartbeat .
i miss you so much .
i missed you , too ...
for so long .
and then i got over it .
i &apos;ll text you when the papers are ready .
i wonder how many clients they have .
i don &apos;t know , but i guess a lot .
not just lonely people .
what about a gay guy who &apos;s not out to his family ?
or a woman at work who wants the boss to stop hitting on her ?
or maybe you just want your mother
to stop pestering you about meeting someone nice
so you can settle down ?
i &apos;m just sayin &apos; .
you don &apos;t think stuart &apos;s death had something to do
with his job here ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to find out .
that &apos;s crazy . our clients loved him .
uh , we heard there were problems .
some hard feelings , maybe .
nothing that anyone would kill someone over .
how do you know ? do you monitor every text
between your employees and clients ?
no , but our cyranos report any problems ,
and we deal with them .
cyranos ?
that &apos;s what we call our responders .
cute .
must be hard to keep responders
when you don &apos;t pay &apos; em for several weeks .
what are you talking about ?
our investor keeps delaying the new funding .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i didn &apos;t want you to worry .
we heard he was pretty upset about it .
i assured him that he would be paid , every cent .
would you mind telling us where you were
between 5 : 00 and 6 : 00 this morning ?
he was right here . we both were . we practically live here .
though it &apos;s obvious
we &apos;re not talking as often as we should be .
there &apos;s security footage if you want to see it .
we do . these problems that stuart was having --
what happened ?
a woman sent some inappropriate pictures .
another tried to meet , but our system keeps
client and responder information anonymous .
those conversations with former clients
weren &apos;t on his phone .
no , but we have them archived on our servers .
we &apos;ll need access to that data --
all your data , as a matter of fact .
so , how &apos;d it go ?
i did it . i talked to him .
yeah ? how do you feel ?
honestly , i don &apos;t feel any different .
i thought i &apos;d be much more relieved ,
like some big burden had been lifted .
maybe it has .
doesn &apos;t feel like it has .
okay , well , you said that keeping your father &apos;s secret
is the reason that you break out in hives
when you tell a lie , right ?
it &apos;s a working hypothesis .
okay , so let &apos;s test it out . lie to me .
what ?
yeah . say something .
anything . but make it big , so it counts .
and then we &apos;ll see if you break out in hives .
jane -- - lie to me !
i really like your new jacket .
‭ fringe has always been one of my favorites .
are you itchy ?
not yet .
all right . i gotta go . but this is good .
keep lying , all right ? keep it up .
maybe you &apos;ve had a breakthrough or something .
oh , hey . the whole fringe jacket thing ?
i &apos;m not keeping it . i was just messing with you .
jane , i love it when you play pranks on me .
yeah , i &apos;ll get some chocolates .
or -- or maybe flowers . flowers are better , right ?
vince , just tell kiki you &apos;re sorry .
couples argue . it &apos;s normal .
well , kiki and i don &apos;t .
mostly , we laugh .
this is our first argument .
i wanna make sure the apology is right .
what did you fight over anyway ?
it was so stupid .
she kept talking about this wedding
she was looking forward to going to ,
and she didn &apos;t invite me .
did you offer to take her ?
no !
obviously , she didn &apos;t want me there .
and i got annoyed and said some things i wish i hadn &apos;t .
oh , so you got your feelings hurt ?
just tell her .
i will .
maybe over a really nice bottle of wine .
uh ... or over a burger and fries .
hey , kiki . you &apos;re looking gorgeous as always .
thank you , angela . it &apos;s nice to see you .
nice to see you , too .
so , uh , your timing is perfect
because vince was just telling me
how he had something very important
he wanted to talk to you about .
adios !
i stopped by the station . they said i &apos;d find you here .
thank you .
well , i thought we were going for more salads .
what can i tell you ? i &apos;m a work in progress .
‭ besides , more salads
doesn &apos;t necessarily mean fewer burgers .
i , uh , i just wanted to apologize for the other night .
i &apos;m not sure exactly what happened --
you don &apos;t have to apologize . i do .
were you upset about me going to the wedding ?
i was ...
disappointed you didn &apos;t ask me to come along .
well ...
i just thought you wanted to take things slower .
why would you think that ?
well , because you haven &apos;t introduced me
to any of your friends .
i mean , except for angela ,
and that was just because we were here .
of course i want you to meet my friends ,
and they are dying to meet you .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
maybe i &apos;ll throw a little get @-@ together tomorrow night .
oh , no , you don &apos;t have to do that .
oh , i want to ...
very much .
accept my apology ?
you want a burger ?
i &apos;d love one .
hey , you free tomorrow night ?
yes . anything to get me out of frankie &apos;s apartment .
are you two at each other &apos;s throats ?
yeah , he &apos;s just , you know ...
&quot; don &apos;t drink my beer . &quot; &quot; put your pizza box away . &quot;
he &apos;s bossier than ma .
well , it is his apartment .
oh , that &apos;s nice . take his side .
what &apos;s tomorrow night ?
you wanna meet kiki ?
well , it &apos;s about time .
hey , jane ?
yeah .
we &apos;ve been going through the data
we got from yourperfectmate .
anything on stuart &apos;s former clients ?
well , nothing suspicious , but we noticed something .
two of his clients mentioned being burglarized
shortly after they began texting with him .
both times , the women told crane they &apos;d be away from home
the night someone broke in .
oh , so they text him the information ,
and then he uses it to rob them .
except that it &apos;s probably not stuart .
we checked the client data
and cross @-@ indexed it with police records .
there have been 27 burglaries reported
by yourperfectmate clients over the last three months ,
and they all follow the same pattern .
they target empty homes and unattended vehicles .
and they &apos;re all assigned to different responders .
who has access to the company &apos;s data ?
unfortunately , a lot of people .
we ran their employee list through our database ,
but no one popped .
we &apos;re gonna check them out one by one ,
but it &apos;s gonna take some time .
i have an idea .
do you still have the naughty cowboy ?
winston ? at your service .
who &apos;s winston ?
nina &apos;s fake boyfriend .
and i am texting him
how my brother ...
leaves his electric guitars in his van at night .
what guitars ?
the expensive ones .
boston p.d. !
turn around !
this is the part when you put your hands on your head .
27 burglaries . you &apos;ve been busy , evan .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
we caught you red @-@ handed .
all i did was break into one empty van .
so this had nothing to do with a text that was sent
by a yourperfectmate client ?
where you just happen to be a programmer .
that van belonged to one of our users ?
wow . that &apos;s a hell of a coincidence .
especially given that every one of these burglaries
also involves a yourperfectmate client .
i don &apos;t know anything about those .
oh , that &apos;s good ...
because we compiled a list of everything that was stolen .
we &apos;re just waiting on a warrant for your apartment .
wonder what we &apos;ll find in there .
help us , and we &apos;ll talk to the d.a.
okay .
maybe i took advantage
of my access to some user information .
i mean , what are these women thinking ,
telling some total stranger all about their personal lives ?
you know , if it wasn &apos;t me , it would &apos;ve been somebody else .
but it was you .
you have help ?
no .
it &apos;s hard to believe you could &apos;ve pulled this off
without anyone else catching on .
who ? the owners ? like they &apos;d ever notice .
well , a cyrano might &apos;ve figured it out .
someone like stuart crane ? maybe he wanted a piece ?
or confronted you about stealing from his clients ?
stuart crane ?
what &apos;s he got to do with this ?
that &apos;s what we wanna know .
something happen to him ?
he was murdered .
wait .
you think ... i had something to do with this .
did you ? - i barely knew the guy . okay ? i --
if you know anything , you need to tell us .
this is serious , evan .
yeah , i get that .
i think i &apos;d like a lawyer now .
here you go .
signed and notarized .
i hope this wasn &apos;t too much trouble .
not at all .
maura , i really am sorry .
i may never be able to express how much .
thank you .
you &apos;re ... probably busy ,
but a colleague of mine is speaking this evening
on the development of the khmuic tribes of thailand and laos .
the khmu language is wonderfully rhythmic .
yes . yes , it is .
and dr. moore is quite engaging .
we used to enjoy the occasional anthropology lecture , didn &apos;t we ?
we did .
maura , i know i may never be able to repair
the schism between us , but perhaps tonight
we can just simply be two ordinary adults
attending a lecture on southeast asian culture ?
i appreciate the invitation , but i can &apos;t .
well ... perhaps next time i &apos;m in town .
have a safe trip .
thank you .
goodbye , maura .
can i ask you something ?
you wanna know why i don &apos;t want to repair
my relationship with my father ,
even though he is reaching out
and attempting to bridge the chasm
that has built up between the two of us over the past two decades .
actually , i was gonna ask you
if you enjoyed those lectures as a young girl .
oh . yes . they were fascinating .
sounds like a snooze fest to me .
but since you did bring it up ,
why don &apos;t you wanna repair your relationship with your father ?
he lives his life . i live mine .
that &apos;s how it &apos;s been ever since he cheated .
so i &apos;ve just -- i &apos;ve come to accept it .
you know , when your kids are little ,
they look up to you . you &apos;re their whole world .
but , uh , parents are not perfect .
don &apos;t get me wrong .
i &apos;m not excusing what your father did .
he made a mistake ,
and one that has caused you so much ...
pain and ... anger .
why hold on to that , maura ?
at this point ,
i &apos;m not certain i know how to let it go .
well , you &apos;ve lived with it for so long .
maybe you should try something different
and see what happens .
baby steps .
are you sure we &apos;re talking about ma ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s shockingly rational advice .
well , your mother can be very rational .
we &apos;re talking about the same person
who thinks she started the led zeppelin riot in 1975 ?
well , we can &apos;t prove she didn &apos;t .
okay , did you find anything that links evan ballard
to stuart &apos;s murder ?
no , the rubber on the boots
that we found in the suspect &apos;s apartment
was not a match to what we found on the fingers .
i &apos;m still waiting -- - jane .
stuart &apos;s personal cell phone just showed up online .
can we track it ?
we don &apos;t have a warrant for gps data yet ,
but whoever has the phone is using the camera .
photos are uploading automatically to stuart &apos;s cloud storage .
well , at least he didn &apos;t erase &apos; em .
looks pretty run down .
maybe a homeless person picked it up ?
that looks like ...
the lip of a skateboard at the bottom ,
but ... that &apos;s not any skate park i know . where is that ?
isotria medeoloides .
you &apos;re so what ?
the small whorled pogonia . it &apos;s a rare native plant .
i saw some on my hike through franklin park .
and if i recall correctly ,
there was an old maintenance area nearby .
okay , well , let &apos;s assume you recall correctly .
how do we get there ?
off the main path ,
you would travel approximately 40 degrees due west --
nope .
okay . oh , if you start where the butterflies nest every spring ...
how do i know where the butterflies nest ? !
well , you would know if you went on these hikes with me .
who wants to go on a hike with -- - i don &apos;t wanna be that person ,
but we only have a location if the phone stays on .
wish granted ! we &apos;re going on a hike . lead the way .
my shoes are suede .
keep walking .
this photo was uploaded two minutes ago ,
and that building &apos;s in the background .
all right , backup &apos;s on the way ,
but i don &apos;t wanna risk losing them . you wanna go around back ?
‭ you stay here .
what do you want to do ?
all right , all right ! i got next , though !
boston p.d.
you know you guys aren &apos;t supposed to be here .
we &apos;re not bothering anybody , officer .
it &apos;s detective . let me see your cell phones .
why ?
&apos;cause i said so .
are we under arrest ?
you keep acting like this , you might be .
well , um , i don &apos;t see a warrant .
so unless you can prove probable cause
or an imminent threat ,
we don &apos;t have to show you anything .
that &apos;s cute . that &apos;s really good . what , you a lawyer ?
it &apos;s called reddit , detective . we know our rights .
let me explain to you about your rights -- -jane .
excuse me .
look .
okay , you know what ? scratch the cell phones .
i just need to see the moron who took this .
hands behind your back .
holiday &apos;s a badass !
put that on reddit .
you get anything from evan ballard ?
lawyer &apos;s still in with him .
hey , kiki &apos;s coming into the robber tonight .
figured it &apos;s time for her to meet everyone .
can you make it ?
sure . you &apos;re introducing her to all of us at once ?
brave man .
yeah .
hey , what &apos;s wrong ?
you &apos;re not having second thoughts about kiki , are you ?
oh , no , no . kiki &apos;s great .
it &apos;s the healthiest relationship i &apos;ve had in ...
maybe ever .
but now that she &apos;s about to meet the family ,
it &apos;s making me realize i ...
i really wanna keep her around .
so what &apos;s the problem ?
well , my track record with women suggests
that the odds of this working out aren &apos;t so great .
everyone &apos;s track record is terrible
until they meet the one that works .
when &apos;d you get so smart ?
ah , i &apos;ve always been smart .
not that anyone would notice .
so far , the kid &apos;s sticking to his story .
says he was hanging out on prescott trail yesterday around 6,
found the cell phone in the dirt .
and thought what , &quot; hey , free phone &quot; ?
pretty much . and he figured out the password
by the finger smudges on the screen .
smart .
that &apos;s not the first word i &apos;d use to describe him ,
but he says that he didn &apos;t see anyone or anything ,
and that includes our body .
you believe him ?
i &apos;m starting to , yeah .
stealing a cell phone hardly seems like a motive for murder .
evan ballard &apos;s lawyer wants to talk .
you think he &apos;s gonna cop to the killing ?
i doubt it .
he seemed genuinely surprised when he heard stuart was dead .
so we have two thieves and no killer .
nina get anything off that phone ?
she &apos;s working on it .
hey . what do you got ?
i went through stuart &apos;s phone .
mostly friends and family ,
but i also found some texts from heather matthews .
the client with the jealous husband ?
her messages to stuart started a week ago
and became increasingly agitated .
they suddenly stopped yesterday .
look at this .
&quot; i don &apos;t understand why you &apos;re ignoring me .
i know you were home yesterday . &quot;
that sounds like she might &apos;ve been stalking him .
what do we have on her ?
no criminal record ,
but her bank account shows a withdrawal
of $ 2,500 from savings a week ago .
might explain that first edition &quot; don juan &quot;
you found in stuart &apos;s dorm .
well , maybe it was a gift .
heather also doesn &apos;t have much of an online presence ,
but this may be why --
she &apos;s got three social media accounts that were closed
for inappropriate and abusive conduct .
evan ballard &apos;s lawyer wants to deal .
he know something about the murder ?
evan admitted that he sold information
to several yourperfectmate clients
who wanted to learn the identities
of their online boyfriends .
was one of them heather matthews ?
it was . that &apos;s why he lawyered up .
didn &apos;t want to be charged as an accessory to murder .
we gotta bring her in .
i &apos;ll get jane .
wait a second .
gasoline .
she &apos;s gonna torch the place .
get the front . i &apos;ll go around back .
shit .
boston p.d. ! don &apos;t move !
get out .
put the lighter up .
he said he was going to leave me .
why does everyone wanna leave me ?
heather , listen to me , okay ?
i understand that this is hard for you .
i thought stuart loved me .
but then he told me it wasn &apos;t real .
he didn &apos;t even appreciate the book .
and it was a very thoughtful gift .
it was perfect !
i followed him onto the trail because ...
i wanted him to understand how much i cared .
he told me to leave him alone .
wait , wait , wait . hey , hey , hey .
look at me . look at me .
look at me , okay ?
i know that you did not want to hurt stuart . okay ?
just like i know you don &apos;t wanna do this .
i know you don &apos;t wanna hurt rick . okay ?
i don &apos;t wanna hurt anyone .
okay .
but nobody leaves me .
no !
nice catch .
easy . take it easy .
put your hands behind your back . it &apos;s gonna be okay .
you ready to go ?
oh , no .
what ? i &apos;m not messing with you .
jane . okay , i &apos;m messing with you a little bit .
i got gasoline on my jacket ,
and luckily , i had this ... at ... my chair .
oh , goodness .
all right . well , before we go ...
there is something that i wanted to say .
are you gonna make some sort of proclamation ?
i am who i am
because of the things that have happened in my life ,
the good and the bad .
sounds very proclamation @-@ y .
my relationships with my family
have been ... challenging at times ,
and they &apos;ve certainly had a significant influence .
but other people have been just as important .
do you mean super ... smart and funny people
that don &apos;t mind borrowing leftovers from your fridge ?
if it wasn &apos;t for you , jane ,
and your family ,
i think i would probably be one of those people
that &apos;s sitting home on a friday night ,
reading medical journals .
and instead , i &apos;m heading out for the evening ,
surrounded by friends .
oh , please . you love those medical journals .
that &apos;s true .
but you all keep me so busy , i never run out of new ones .
in that case , you &apos;re welcome .
now let &apos;s go !
please don &apos;t do that in public .
i can &apos;t help it !
jane , that fringe is gonna scratch your cornea .
or yours , so stay back !
i &apos;ll just do it to the car .
i promise ... but keep your distance !
oh , my god .
... and that &apos;s when i realized
the towel was stuck in the elevator door .
no !
yes !
so what did you do ?
so i stood up straight
and i saluted the very shocked army captain
and said , &quot; just doing my part for the enlisted men , sir . &quot;
i &apos;ll get the next round .
oh , i &apos;ll get &apos; em .
no , let me . i &apos;m in good with the owner .
besides , when will you all have time to talk about me ?
okay , she &apos;s fantastic .
why have you been hiding her all this time ?
i was afraid you all might scare her off .
mm . oh , not a chance . she loves us .
and we love her .
i &apos;m so happy i had a chance to meet her .
i &apos;m sorry i have to leave .
i &apos;m just happy you were here .
thank you .
you sure you don &apos;t wanna take a twirl in the fringe jacket ?
i &apos;m seriously tempted , but i think i &apos;m okay .
all right . but just so you know ,
the fringe is always here for you .
okay . thanks .
cam , i &apos;ll catch up with you after the lecture , if that &apos;s okay ?
as it turns out ,
i couldn &apos;t resist the pull of a dr. moore lecture .
well , i can hardly blame you . you &apos;re only human .
shall we ?
sure .
one thing i should mention
in the interest of full disclosure ...
what &apos;s that ?
i actually find the eastern khmu dialect
more interesting than the western khmu .
oh , that &apos;s ridiculous .
oh , no , no . narrow registration , tonal palate .
the language is much purer .
