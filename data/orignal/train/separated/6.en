第五季第十四集
by Frank Sinatra
What was that?
What?
You nodded. What part?
Alicia.
Okay.
You hated it.
No, I... - Self-serving?
No, it's, uh... - Boring.
I'm... sorry. Go ahead.
It's dry.
Oh, my God, Cary, I spent two weeks on that speech.
Yeah, and it feels like you spent two weeks on it.
I have to give this speech tomorrow.
So rewrite it.
They didn't ask you because you're an expert
on opt-out moms.
They asked you because you were an opt-out mom.
Clarke, where are you?
In traffic.
New York is the city of endless possibilities.
It's a different adventure every day and every minute.
Excuse me, how do I turn this down?
No, no, cars in front. Cannot turn right.
Sorry. Rayna Hecht called.
She wants to have the meeting now.
She what?
She wants to have the meeting right now!
Not tonight. And I'm stuck in traffic.
Uh... Rayna Hecht wants to meet right now.
What? Why?
Clarke, we're not ready.
We are ready. Just tell her about the firm.
She doesn't care about our size.
She wants to go someplace with a future.
She'd down in the lounge. She's waiting right now.
We got to go.
Cary, listen to me.
She brings a full portfolio of clients with her.
Over $60 million a year in billing. We need her.
She is the very definition of a rainmaker.
What? Clarke...
can you turn down your TV?
I'm trying, but the mayor
won't stop talking.
But I guarantee you...
Rayna Hecht is a rainmaker.
We need her. Every firm in Chicago...
New York is the city
of endless possibilities.
It's a different adventure... - And he's back.
I can't hear you, all right?
I'm gonna have to call you back. Bye.
Why am I having so much trouble with this speech?
Look, look, look.
It's the keynote speech at the ABA
and you're trying to impress people. Don't.
They don't want to hear facts and figures...
they want to hear your story.
You went from an opt-out mom to the partner in a law firm
in four years.
That's your speech.
Thanks.
There.
Every lawyer is after her.
Great.
Can you believe this?
I'll be honest.
I like you guys. I do.
And I do intend to decide in the next 48 hours.
But I want a partnership that I can believe in.
I'm leaving Hartley & Jenner because of the indictments.
If you're worried about my suspension a few years ago,
that's past, and I'm a better lawyer for it.
Good pitch.
Thanks.
Okay, well, let me get my little ducks in a row,
and we'll talk.
Thank you, Ms. Hecht.
Thank you.
So, you're a big firm now...
making a presence at the ABA?
Out shaking the trees, just like you.
Good luck with the keynote tomorrow.
Don't let him get in your head.
Ms. Hecht, hello.
I'm Cary Agos. Alicia Florrick.
Hey. I'm sorry if I don't sit down,
but I need to make a few calls.
why don't we do this another time? Good to meet you.
What happened?
We lost our slot.
She'll vet us.
We're good.
No one's under indictment.
Damian.
He's not under indictment.
Well, we want her.
$60 million in client billing.
You coming?
Uh, no, I'll see you later.
Lot of lawyers at this thing, huh?
Do you have a minute?
No.
I can take my time, Mr. Gardner.
I was on the Blagojevich case.
We always knew that sooner or later the lawyers would talk.
They want to talk; they need to talk.
They know that attorney-client privilege only gets them so far.
Earplugs, please.
The problem you have, Mr. Gardner,
is that voter fraud is an ongoing crime, a conspiracy.
If you're protecting the governor, you're just as guilty.
That's why you'll talk.
The governor is not your friend.
No one... no judge or disciplinary body...
will blame you for breaking attorney-client privilege.
You can't freeze me out, Mr. Gardner.
I'm an agent of the Office of Public Integrity.
I have subpoena power.
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
I'll get on with Clarke, see if we can set up another time.
Okay, and I will get on with Robyn
and have her look into her background.
No, no, no, you go back to your room and you work on your speech.
Cary, it'll only take a minute...
Alicia...
you're procrastinating.
Go back to your room and work on your keynote.
Okay? Remember, personal stories.
Robyn, what are you doing?
Just... write anything down.
Mrs. Alicia Florrick.
Hi. I'm Lorainne Joy.
Thank you for coming in.
Oh, thank you for inviting me in, Ms. Joy.
How could I not?
Your name just sort of popped out at me.
Oh, my God, your husband.
If my husband did that to me...
look, I don't know what I would do.
Thank you.
No, I know what I would do.
I would... probably scratch his eyes out.
That's what I would do.
Oh... you don't need to give me a resume.
Just tell me about yourself.
When did you last practice law?
Well, officially...
13 years ago.
But... I helped advise on a lot of cases.
On your husband's cases?
Yes.
Uh-huh. Well, good.
Listen, here's the thing... Alicia.
We don't really have any positions available
at the moment.
I know... the position we have
is for starting associate.
Oh, well, I'm... I'm open for that.
No. That wouldn't really be appropriate.
You know, we make a big play
for the Ivy League pool for that, so...
Alicia Florrick.
When can you start?
What? When can I... start work?
Yes. You want to work here?
I do. Uh, um, now.
I'm... Tomorrow, if you'd like.
Good. Uh, come on back in,
and I'll assign you a desk.
Yeah!
It doesn't officially show till Wednesday.
How much?
Well, I warned you you'd fall in love with it.
It's not really in your range.
I have a job now.
My range has changed. How many rooms?
Three. Two baths and a maid's.
I love the light. The windows are great.
I have a three- bedroom on 5th.
It's half this rent.
I like this.
I'm... I'm sorry. What?
It's a paralegal job.
Mr. Acocella, I'm sorry, but...
I... I-I thought it was an associate position.
Yes, I know, but it's
more of an internship.
Mr. Acocella, I made plans based on that understanding.
I made... financial outlays...
I'm sorry.
I... told the partners.
They were worried about your last name.
They don't want you here as an associate.
I need a paycheck.
I'm sorry.
Marina, it's Alicia.
The apartment...
Is there any way to get out of the lease?
Hello.
Yeah. Uh, I-I forgot. I'll be right down.
What is the key to litigation?
What is it?
Who was that man by the elevator?
What man?
Have we stopped trusting each other?
Nelson Dubeck.
Office of Public Integrity.
They're pursuing a case against...
the governor.
The ballot box?
Why you and not me?
There's a surveillance tape.
Smoking gun. I took it to Peter Florrick.
What are you going to do?
Unfortunately, Mr. Pling
couldn't make it because of the hurricane
I don't know.
But another litigator has agreed to step in.
Please welcome a new voice to this ABA meeting,
Elizabeth, uh... Elsbeth
Tascioni.
Sorry.
Hello. Whoa.
Sorry.
Okay.
Okay. Um, what is my approach...
to litigation? Well...
No. Will, no.
Okay...
Sorry. I want everybody to close their eyes
and picture a pillow,
a big pillow, the size of this room,
and you're lying in the middle of it.
Now, take off your shoes.
Then I'll give a brief introduction,
and you'll enter from that wing over there.
You sure there'll be this many people?
Oh, yes. We've had great interest in your keynote.
Now, is there anything you'll need tomorrow?
A speech.
No, I meant... bottled water?
Alicia.
We have a reprieve with Rayna Hecht.
It's Clarke.
Hello? Mr. Hayden?
I can't hear you.
Alicia? Hello?
If fashion's your thing, you'll find
the best shopping in the world,
SoHo, Chelsea, Greenwich Village...
How's that?
Better.
I just talked with Rayna Hecht.
She wanted to apologize for her abruptness.
She didn't know you were you.
I was me?
The governor's wife.
She's coming to your keynote.
She can't wait to hear what you'll say.
The speech. Did he tell you
that the speech matters?
You need to do a good job with your keynote.
She wants to wait to decide whether to meet
until after the keynote.
And that's the most I've ever said "Keynote" in my entire life.
So how's the speech coming?
Alicia? Hello?
Clarke? Where are you?
Okay, Clarke, I-I can't hear.
Where are you?
Alicia Florrick.
I haven't seen you since Georgetown.
Another life ago. You work here?
In this building? No. On Madison. What about you?
I just got a job.
You did? Really? Where?
Wells & Brolin.
That's a good firm. Congratulations.
Thanks.
Nice shoes.
A baby threw up on my shoes.
You going to the garage?
Yes. You?
Uh, deposition.
It was nice seeing you.
And, hey, uh...
I'm sorry about all that crap with your husband.
Thanks. It'll die down.
It will.
Call me sometime.
Stern, Lockhart & Gardner.
Hey. You got top billing.
Mm, I'm an impressive person.
I never doubted it for a minute.
It was good seeing you.
You, too.
Oh, thank you so much.
I love bears.
Um, can I just have one hug? Okay?
You dirty Jew.
Excuse me?
You dirty stinking Jew.
Did you just call me a dirty stinking Jew?
What, are you deaf?
Oh, my God.
Elsbeth, thanks for meeting me out here.
There's too many lawyers at the hotel.
Did you hear that? That bear just called me a dirty Jew.
What?
That bear there.
He said I was a dirty stinking Jew.
Watch out! That bear is...
anti-Semitic!
Elsbeth, look,
ab-about my situation.
I've been subpoenaed by Nelson Dubeck,
the Office of Public Integrity, and he's using it to pressure me
to get to Peter Florrick.
But it would mean breaking attorney-client privilege.
Right.
If you testify against Governor Florrick,
you risk disbarment.
But if you don't, you risk contempt of court.
Right.
Not good.
It's that one percent doctrine.
Hey, watch out for that bear!
The what?
One percent.
If you're even one percent vulnerable, you're vulnerable.
Who got you this video?
Kalinda.
Good. Good.
I'll call her. I like Kalinda.
Hey. Are you with that bear?
Because I think someone needs to talk to him.
S-So you'll represent me on this?
This Dubeck guy, he's at the hotel?
Yes.
Good. Okay, yes. Okay.
I'm feeling a bit vulnerable, but I'm gonna use it.
Yeah.
Kalinda, it's Will. How are things there?
Pass it here.
Uh... yeah, they're fine.
Things are different when the lawyers are gone.
Kalinda, we need your help on something.
This is Elsbeth.
Kalinda.
Kalinda, hi. Oh, I miss you.
I miss you, too, Elsbeth.
Can you look into someone named Nelson Dubeck?
He's with the Office of Public Integrity.
Anything you can find, dirt or past arrests.
Maybe he has a drinking problem.
I am not a dirty stinking Jew!
但它毕竟存在过
Is there any way...
to delay the lease?
Okay.
No, I'll...
I'll figure something out.
You can always live with me.
Oh. Thank you so much, Jackie.
But this is a good school district.
You don't need to worry about a good school district.
Hold on. Alicia's here.
Okay, give us a minute.
That was Robyn. She has an instinct on Rayna Hecht.
How's the speech going?
Mr. Hayden, you got out of your taxi.
Yes, I decided to walk.
It was only 15 blocks.
So, Robyn thinks Hecht isn't leaving her firm
because of the indictments.
Or just because of the indictments.
What then?
The firm has ten senior partners
and Hecht was the only woman.
A boys' club.
So she probably wants a more woman-friendly firm.
Okay.
So just...
just play up the feminism angle in your keynote.
Frame your story as one of female empowerment.
Okay. Thanks. I need to, um... write.
And I've been talking up the keynote.
A lot of potential clients are excited about it.
Okay.
Let's let the master at it.
You'll be great.
Mr. Gardner.
I just wanted to say...
I'm a worthy lawyer who needs a job.
Women are underrepresented in this business,
and I shouldn't be overlooked just...
Hello, Will? It's Alicia.
Do you have a minute?
No, really?
You did not.
I don't look anything like those photos anymore.
Well, um...
you said I should call if I got a chance, so...
this is me calling.
What are you wearing that for?
You weren't even here.
Don't change the subject.
It's business-like.
You spent $300 on it.
Well, that's what a good dress costs.
Your husband is wasting away in prison
and you're trying to seduce your way into a job.
Your son is the one who put me here.
I have two kids.
What am I supposed to do?
No.
You like nice things.
So go be a whore.
I did- did do that.
So...
that covers me up to last June.
Now about you?
Oh, well...
there's not much to say.
I'm a mother, a wife
and now a disgraced spouse.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no, that... that wasn't self-pity,
that was me trying to make light of it.
I think I've lost my touch.
No, the touch is still there.
And now you have a new job?
Unfortunately, it was a paralegal job.
Voluntary.
You're kidding.
Yeah... no.
I was, um, misinformed.
Have you thought about working here?
Is there an opening here?
Well... we could.
I haven't worked in 13 years.
Are you saying you're rusty?
No!
No.
I'm good.
You've always been good.
Will, I... I'm...
My connection with my husband hurts me.
Why are you trying to dissuade me now?
I don't know.
Because I'm making no sense.
We've all got a past that could hurt us.
Don't let yours hurt you.
You here for the job?
I think I am.
You?
Yup.
Cary.
Excuse me.
What did you think of me when you first met me?
Is this about your speech, or more procrastinating?
Speech.
I liked you.
You did not.
Do you even remember where it was?
Yeah, in reception.
Waiting for our interviews.
I thought you were gonna get it.
And I wasn't.
I thought you were a cocky new associate.
I was a cocky new associate.
And I thought you were entitled.
I was a little entitled.
Poor. But entitled.
Can you be both?
Oh, yeah. So...
who would you hire if we had to hire someone today?
You.
Yeah, me, too.
You're supposed to say me.
No, no.
And you wouldn't hire yourself, either.
You're right. I hate that about myself.
No.
It's smart.
So why did Will hire you?
Because you're a slut.
What?
Nothing. I need to finish.
Okay.
Good luck.
Thank you, Kalinda,
that is great.
Uh, good-bye, Ka... uh, Kalinda.
I don't know.
Yeah, I got... I got to go, someone's here.
Uh, hello?
Elsbeth Tascioni. How are you?
I'm good. Do I know you?
Oh, no.
But you're Nelson Dubeck from the Office of Public Integrity.
You helped prosecute Rod Blagojevich.
I did. Do you need something?
Yeah, I need you to leave Will Gardner alone
or I'll sue you for harassment.
Mr. Gardner should consider how seriously I take this.
Take what?
He acquired a videotape
of a stuffed ballot box.
He brought that videotape to the governor-elect.
And he attempted to show it to him.
What videotape?
What is that?
That is a videotape of three men taking a ballot box
into a polling place.
No, it looks like a... GIF.
Or is a "Jif"?
GIF.
Have you ever seen the GIF of that bear, uh,
falling onto a trampoline and then bouncing into a pool?
It is so funny, but I was surprised to find out
that the pool was... faked.
All digitally futzed with.
If you're suggesting that
this videotape was in any way manipulated...
Oh, eight bits per pixel makes a GIF highly manipulatable... ble.
I hope you have the original,
because otherwise I'm gonna object
to the jif being admitted into court.
The governor's guilty.
How do you know that?
He's the governor of Illinois.
And...
you think they're all corrupt?
No, they just happen to be all corrupt.
So it doesn't matter what the facts are,
you'll prosecute Peter Florrick for the crime of voter fraud?
Peter Florrick spent six months in prison. He's a criminal.
Who was exonerated.
No, his case was dismissed.
So you're out to get him.
I'm out to get a criminal.
Even if there's no proof?
I'll find the proof.
This is Elsbeth Tascioni recording
Nelson Dubeck in the lobby
of the Harrington Plaza at...
11::33 P.M.
I'd erase that, ma'am.
You did not have my permission to make that recording,
and without that permission you are subject to prosecution.
Oh, no, not in New York.
Two-party consent is the law in Illinois, s
but this is New York.
One-party consent is enough here
and I am one party.
And I give my consent.
I suggest you leave Mr. Gardner alone, sir.
He's a nice man.
He has no part in your vendetta against Governor Florrick.
By the way,
you should look into an anti-Semitic
costumed furry bear in Times Square.
Very few lawyers can reach their prime
after a decade as a mother in suburbia,
but Alicia Florrick is...
special.
Row four, far left.
Great.
Remember, say it loud and with a smile.
People will believe whatever you tell them.
Oh, and, uh, Rayna Hecht is here.
It would help our cause if you could dazzle her.
...Alicia Florrick.
The governor's guilty.
How do you know that?
He's the governor of Illinois.
You got him to say that?
I didn't get him to say anything.
He wanted to say it.
If he comes after you, we'll use it.
But he's not coming after me.
I don't think so. Not with what he has.
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
No, no, no.
I'm just, um...
Got to go.
I prepared by looking in a mirror.
It was the only interview I could still get.
When you're sitting across the desk
from someone who can hire you,
you feel every one of those 13 years.
But, luckily, I had a very good interviewer.
He asked me if I was up to it,
coming back to the workplace.
The interviewer pointed out that I was
arguing against myself.
I should stop...
pointing out reasons why I shouldn't be hired.
What did I learn from this?
Use everything you have
to get the job.
And don't feel entitled.
Will Gardner.
Just hear me out.
The hiring committee has voted.
Yeah, but we shouldn't penalize her.
Her face is on the news 24-7.
Every political blog is writing about her.
Wait, she wasn't the one who slept with the hookers.
Were you involved with this woman?
What?
You never push for associate hires.
She was my friend.
And... the smartest person in our class.
Give me something I can sell to the other partners.
There's a lawyer I'm trying to bring on board,
but I'm getting some push back.
I need you to put a dossier together on her.
Okay. Who is she?
Alicia Florrick.
Peter Florrick's wife?
Yeah. Why?
Nothing.
Of course, the advantage of being a woman opting back in
is that no one ever questioned
why you opted out in the first place.
Women are cut little slack on this.
Men, even less.
I looked into Alicia Florrick.
I spoke to her old firm.
She managed to win a couple dozen cases
before taking her maternity leave.
Even managed to bring in some small clients.
But?
They were about to fire her.
They thought she wasn't tough enough.
She never knew, but they said
she lacked a killer instinct.
What do you want me to do with this?
Bury it.
The one upside to a scandal or a tragedy in your life
is that it is the best kind of wake-up call.
Would I have done it any differently if I were a man?
Would I have...
Uh, would I have done...
I mean, uh...
Uh, would I have felt differently if I were a man?
What's going on?
Lindler just launched a hostile takeover of MRG Pharmaceuticals.
Everybody wants to get in on it.
Excuse me.
The answer is I would never do it differently.
The key is to raise your profile.
Opt-out moms are held to a higher standard
than anyone else.
We... have to work harder.
We have to make up for lost time.
Uh, is there any other...?
It was across the street.
I'm almost finished. I won't bother you.
Scotch, no ice.
They only have beer.
Beer.
It's hard to get drunk on beer.
Mm, you just got to try harder.
Yeah, yeah.
She doesn't like me, and I don't give a flying crap.
Flying crap.
Go to hell. Is that better?
You're in a bad mood.
I just had 300 people walk out on me.
It looked like 400.
Why do you hate me?
Well, I don't like you.
Hate's probably too strong.
Why?
Are you serious?
Because of that?
Three weeks. Three weeks you were scheming.
That wasn't my fault.
I wanted to leave right away.
With our clients.
Wow. It just never ends.
Don't ask the question if you don't want the answer.
What?
We could never make it work.
You're linking two things together I never did.
Thanks a lot.
You want to say "Bitch," Say "Bitch""
Bitch.
So,
you're saying that if I were any other partner leaving,
you would hate me the way you do?
I'm saying, if you were any other partner,
I'd be as unhappy and competitive as I am now.
I don't believe you.
That's your right.
You're enjoying your pain too much.
So,
you're gonna fight me on every client, every case?
I will be your competitor.
You're up for it.
You're a big girl.
Okay.
I guess it's something.
Mm. It's something.
Yes.
Where are you? Can you talk?
I'm in the coffee shop across the street.
And no.
Someone's sitting near you?
Yes.
Rayna Hecht was impressed with your speech.
She wants to meet.
Uh... when?
Now. She's leaving early tomorrow.
Now?
I-I've had a few.
Few?
Nothing. Uh, where?
In the lounge. She wants to have a quick drink with us.
Great.
A meeting?
A very important meeting.
How to destroy our competitors.
Good. I expect no less.
May the best man win.
Mr. Gardner?
Yes?
We've never met. Jim Moody.
I used to work...
I know who you are.
I need five minutes of your time.
No.
Please.
Look, this guy from Justice, Dubeck...
he's turning the screws on me.
Listen to me.
You and I are both witnesses in a grand jury hearing.
Legally, we cannot talk to each other.
I just want to make sure you and I are telling the same story.
Did you hear what I just said?
I only did what Eli Gold told me to do that night.
I don't care.
You stay the hell away from me, or I'll call security.
Five minutes isn't much time,
so just keep it all bullet points.
I'll talk about firm culture, and Alicia...
I will handle women-friendly policies,
and crapital structure.
Our what?
Capital structure.
You said "Crapital."
No, I didn't.
Mrs. Florrick,
are you inebriated?
I'll be fine.
Oh, dear God.
Okay, all right. Well, let-let us just talk,
and then, you just go ahead...
Hello. Oh, don't get up.
Don't get up. Please.
I'm so sorry for blowing you off earlier.
And don't say I didn't, because I did.
Ah, Mrs. Florrick. Hello.
Hello.
Powerful speech.
And I'm sorry so many of our colleagues had to miss it.
Thank you.
So we wanted to talk about our firm. We're just
getting started, but we read your article...
I'll be honest.
I like you guys. I do.
And I do intend to decide within the next 48 hours.
And I'm interested in your firm because you
have female partners.
Yes, we try not to discriminate,
in promotion at all.
Good.
Were you unhappy at Lockhart/Gardner?
Oh, I... um, I was happy up to a point.
They... uh, let me grow.
They let me...
...learn.
And then, I had to put what I learned on its feet.
And that's what we're doing at Florrick-Agos, so,
Clarke, why don't you just...
you go ahead and talk about the, um...
Yes, our, uh, crapital structure.
Capital. Capital structure.
What do you want, Alicia?
What do I want?
Yes. What do you want?
I want a happy life,
and I want to control my fate.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Alicia.
Good talking to you.
Was that a good thing?
How were you supposed to answer?
Ms. Tascioni, don't take this the wrong way,
but you have an awful voice.
I know.
I know, but this city... it inspires me.
Really? I find it makes me sweat.
I'm gonna treat us to some more little drinks.
I'm old-fashioned, Ms. Tascioni. I'll treat.
No, no, no.
I'm having a good day.
I just landed a new partner I met.
We're starting a two-woman firm.
My I ask your partner's name?
Rayna Hecht.
Oh, excuse me. Buzzy, buzz.
I got to go. I'm sorry.
Please excuse the cramped quarters.
What's going on?
From the start, Wayne.
That is you and Jim Moody
conversing in private, Mr. Gardner.
Look, there was no conversing.
I told him to stay away.
Will.
Well, to a grand jury,
it's going to look like two witnesses conspiring to
cover up election fraud.
That's ten years in federal prison.
You can't be serious.
The best part, Ms. Tascioni, is
this is the original surveillance video.
The chain of custody is perfect and unimpeachable in court.
You cut a deal with Moody?
Mr. Gardner, you still have to see the forest through the trees.
I'm not interested in you.
I want Peter Florrick.
All you have to do is testify against him.
We'll think about it.
You have 48 hours.
My plane lands at 9:00 A.M.
I'll see you at home?
Love you.
Hi, Ms. Florrick.
Lorainne Joy from Clements & Holloway.
You came in for an interview a few years ago?
Of course. Ms. Joy. Hello.
Lorraine, please.
I head your speech last night.
It was terrific.
Thank you.
Listen, I know you've got your own shop now,
but we were wondering if you could come in for a chat,
see if we could convince you to maybe come work for us?
Oh, thank you,
but I'm happy where I am.
Okay.
Well, maybe down the road.
You're hired.
I...
What?
First year associate. You start on Monday.
My God, I thought you were going to say,
"Sorry, the position is filled"
Nope. You're stuck with us.
Now you have to impress us.
I can do that.
Will, thank you.
I-I know you didn't have to.
Alicia, when I'm broke
and lying in an alley somewhere, do something nice for me.
Okay. Promise.
Good. Now start reading up on contract law.
On my way.
