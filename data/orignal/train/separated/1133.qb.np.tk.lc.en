第一季 第十九集
don &apos;t tell .
i &apos;m in the shower , mom .
all right , see you at dinner .
want to share a towel too ?
2 @-@ 1 @-@ 4 .
could be anything-- a house number ,
你也许是对的 -托比
an area code .
we have to figure it out , for both our sakes .
i would like to compose some music for the play .
sure . that &apos;d be great .
i didn &apos;t even know they knew each other .
what is that ?
what did he just give her ?
you know you want to kiss me .
come closer .
oh , my god !
is that ...
blood ?
you think that &apos;s what ian used ...
to kill alison ?
which one of you found the trophy ?
it &apos;s not human blood .
why would there-- ?
let &apos;s save our questions for the precinct . follow me .
the video was sent to us by an anonymous source .
probably the same person who sent it to you .
it was loaded onto spencer &apos;s laptop .
this time we saw who alison was talking to .
it was ian .
he told her to come closer .
and she did .
ian and alison were together
the weekend before she went missing .
spencer called hilton head .
it was spencer ...
who talked to the desk clerk .
ian lied to spencer .
he stayed at hilton head last summer .
this is what i don &apos;t understand--
ian was a star athlete , right ?
popular guy , dating a beautiful woman like your sister .
you really think he would risk all that to be with alison ?
she was barely 15 .
well , maybe he has a thing for younger girls .
why would you say that ?
i don &apos;t know .
were there other younger girls he was interested in ?
not that i know of .
no .
no .
no one but alison .
you &apos;ll be available for more questions ?
of course . the girls have nothing to hide .
pam just stepped out to call wayne .
are they being charged with something--
conspiracy to commit an honest mistake ?
sorry .
haven &apos;t they been through enough ?
the girls are free to go .
i &apos;m still trying to process this .
it appears our daughters
have been the victims of a cruel joke .
whoever said &quot; the truth will set you free &quot;
never met &quot; a. &quot;
jesus .
it &apos;s from the bible . jesus said it .
then aria &apos;s right ,
because that bitch is going straight to hell .
i wasn &apos;t completely honest in there .
i should have been , but my mom was right next to me ,
and with the whole wren thing ,
i couldn &apos;t bring myself to say
that i also hooked up with ian .
that has nothing to do with this .
i lied about it too , spence .
you know , sometimes telling the truth does more harm than good .
who said that ?
alison .
hey , emily .
garrett ?
you &apos;re a cop now ?
look , uh , sorry they &apos;re putting you through this .
officer reynolds .
probably wants a refill on his coffee and another jelly donut .
he looks good in a uniform .
sir ?
you know those girls ?
my parents lived down the street from emily fields ,
so we used to be neighbors .
you think they &apos;re telling the truth ?
uh ... i don &apos;t know why they would lie , sir .
neither do i.
but you &apos;re gonna help me find out .
sir ?
unless you &apos;d rather be writing parking tickets .
did you get some sleep ?
a little .
yeah , we all needed a night to settle down and ...
rethink this .
have you talked to melissa ?
yeah .
yeah , we talked to melissa and ian .
they weren &apos;t that surprised .
in hindsight , your sister saw it coming ...
and we should have too .
saw what coming ?
we should have insisted that you see someone
after they found alison .
we &apos;re not blaming you , we &apos;re blaming ourselves .
like-- like a shrink ?
dad ?
look , you-- you told the police everything you know .
so while they &apos;re doing their job ,
we just think you should see a therapist ,
talk about how you feel .
i @-@ i feel scared .
okay ?
i feel scared every day that he &apos;s here .
please , there &apos;s nothing wrong with me .
i hope you get the help you need .
spencer , i want you to know i &apos;m not angry with you .
i &apos;m confused , but i &apos;m not mad .
what i don &apos;t understand is why you came back to rosewood .
you got away with it .
you &apos;re sick .
melissa .
that &apos;s how i deal with this , dad .
i have to believe you &apos;re ill .
if you had just stayed away ,
no one ever would have known .
now , that &apos;s enough .
the trophy wasn &apos;t real ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean that he didn &apos;t do it .
oh , my god , do you hear yourself ?
i &apos;m just making things worse by being here .
spencer , i meant what i said .
why can &apos;t you just let me be happy ?
this isn &apos;t about you !
you &apos;re right .
like always , it &apos;s about you .
look , i know what this must look like , and ...
no .
honey , i don &apos;t think you do .
i forgot my bag here last night .
have you been swimming at nights
because you know i &apos;m here in the mornings ?
it &apos;s just kind of worked out that way .
i left you a couple of messages .
i went to visit my aunt .
she &apos;s old and sick .
i thought maybe you were avoiding me .
no . i just ...
no .
okay , this is beyond awkward .
can we please talk about what happened ?
there &apos;s nothing to talk about .
you kissed me , remember ?
emily , just drop it .
so you want to pretend like it didn &apos;t happen ?
yes . please .
consider it forgotten .
are you sure that you want to stay here ?
i can &apos;t handle another fight with jenna ,
i don &apos;t want to go home until my parents get back ,
and i don &apos;t think your parents are gonna offer me the guest room .
it &apos;s my fault she &apos;s making your life so miserable .
i didn &apos;t have to take her phone .
how does she know it was you ?
she doesn &apos;t . but with jenna ,
suspicion is enough .
i really am sorry .
that &apos;s okay .
my folks &apos;ll be back on monday ,
and they &apos;re usually a decent buffer .
you never talk about your parents .
neither do you .
the house of hastings isn &apos;t exactly
my safe place to land right now , either .
spencer ,
if jenna has anything to do with you being framed ,
i &apos;ll do whatever i can to help you .
thank you .
enjoy your shower .
i intend to .
morning .
thanks .
okay , pebbles or puffs ?
uh ... surprise me .
that tickles .
really ?
you &apos;re not laughing .
hanna ?
my ass just fell into the toilet for the second time this week .
you know , i was cleaning yesterday .
i forgot to put the seat back down .
sorry .
expecting company ?
no .
was he here last night ?
upstairs , in the no @-@ boy zone ?
nope .
don &apos;t lie to me , hanna .
i know what you think of him , and he does too .
that &apos;s why he doesn &apos;t hang around here anymore .
okay , he came over a few times ,
but it was to help me with my homework .
right . i know boys like caleb .
he &apos;s a tough guy ,
so you think you &apos;re safe with him , but you &apos;re not .
caleb is looking out for caleb .
you may know guys like caleb ,
but you don &apos;t know him .
that was close .
it was too close . you should take this to go .
what are you still doing here ?
forgot something .
what ?
怕了吧 我就知道 -a
sorry to interupt .
i @-@ i can come back later , if you &apos;re busy .
i was just leaving .
thank you again for your help , mr. fitz .
absolutely , jenna .
he &apos;s all yours .
jenna is submitting a short story to a competition .
oh , i thought music was her thing .
i think she &apos;s got a shot at winning .
so , um , tonight i was thinking
that i would cook instead of takeout .
sure . i &apos;ve got a faculty thing at four ,
and i promised jenna another round of notes .
what &apos;s her story about ?
exposing people . the protagonist is blind ,
but she &quot; sees &quot; more than sighted people .
so it &apos;s about her ?
she says it &apos;s fiction ,
but it begins on the night of an accident ,
and her brother is responsible for it .
was it really toby &apos;s fault ?
he-- he set fire to the garage ,
but he didn &apos;t know jenna was inside .
her story suggests that it wasn &apos;t an accident .
i wouldn &apos;t know .
佩奇
i can &apos;t believe that this is happening .
do you want us to talk to them for you ?
no .
who ?
spencer &apos;s parents think she &apos;s nuts .
unstable .
and why should they believe me ?
i mean , we have no proof .
i &apos;m the girl who cried wolf .
and the wolf is living in your backyard .
right , which is why i need to get into room 214 .
spencer thinks jenna has a room
at the edgewood motor court .
did you say 214 ?
and i saw the bag that ian gave her . it &apos;s in the room .
ok . i think we need to take a break from playing charlie &apos;s angels .
i don &apos;t want to spend another night with the rosewood p.d.
hey !
and there goes lucy liu .
garrett , can i talk to you for a second ?
sure . what &apos;s up ?
i know that most of the evidence we have on ian is weak .
&quot; weak &quot; ? it &apos;s nonexistent .
you have to follow up on hilton head .
i know that he was there . i spoke to the clerk myself .
i &apos;m waiting for a manager to call me back .
if ian was there with alison , i &apos;ll find out .
thank you .
hey , spencer .
yeah ?
why would ian want ali dead ?
because she was going to tell melissa about their affair .
i understand why you &apos;re so fond of mr. fitz .
he takes such a personal interest in his students .
i feel like i can tell him anything .
i was thinking of suggesting he add orwell &apos;s 1984
to the reading list .
you know ... big brother &apos;s always watching you .
mr. fitz isn &apos;t seduced by controlling characters .
you do know him better .
scrabble .
mad libs .
&quot; bikes to die for , babes to fight for . &quot;
page 12 . it &apos;s a great read .
thanks .
and i downloaded this app
that turns my phone into a listening device .
that way , if anybody goes next door ,
we &apos;ll be able to hear them through the wall .
caffeine ?
i think you &apos;ve had enough .
hey , did you just come out of room 214 ?
is there any way that we can get in there ?
is it your room ?
no , but we--
i &apos;ve got work to do .
wait , um ...
for a 20,
can we pretend that he said yes ?
spencer , jenna &apos;s glasses .
this is her room .
the bag was on the bed .
nothing .
so ... what &apos;s it gonna be first ?
mac and cheese or fluff &apos; n &apos; fold ?
mom .
what are you doing here ? i thought you were working late .
it &apos;s time for you to say goodbye , caleb .
no , he just got here .
you mean he just got back .
i found this in the basement .
i should go .
no , don &apos;t leave .
excellent idea .
mom , he stayed here one night .
really ? because the kitchen cabinet fixed itself ;
a week ago , our grocery bill has tripled ;
and i know you don &apos;t carb @-@ load for breakfast .
this isn &apos;t her fault .
save it .
just go .
don &apos;t come back .
he had nowhere to go .
this isn &apos;t a halfway house .
can &apos;t he just please spend the night ?
it &apos;s getting late , and if he doesn &apos;t stay here ,
he &apos;ll wind up sleeping on a bench at the bus station .
we don &apos;t lie to each other , hanna .
you have arrived at your destination .
hey , don &apos;t forget to sign up
for your turn at karaoke tonight .
do you come here a lot ?
i didn &apos;t realize it was so ...
rustic ?
i found it online .
i thought it would be ...
remote .
you gonna finish all my sentences ?
sorry .
that was a joke .
i think ...
i was ...
you go first .
you were right today .
i was avoiding you .
i scared myself that night when i ...
kissed me ?
there you go again .
the first time i saw you with maya ,
when i realized you were together ...
i finally admitted to myself that i was like you .
am i the first girl you &apos;ve kissed ?
romantic , huh ?
definitely you surprised me .
so , was maya your first girlfriend ?
she was .
but she wasn &apos;t the first girl i &apos;ve ever kissed .
i was in love with alison .
was she in love with you ?
no .
i didn &apos;t know her well , but ...
she seemed like a very dynamic person .
she was that .
maya was kind of like that too , right ?
yeah , i ... guess i like ...
ballsy women .
welcome home , honey .
wow .
are we celebrating something i &apos;m not aware of ?
no .
you &apos;re wearing this dress because ... ?
because i just ... wanted to hear you say wow .
i like coming home to you .
sorry i &apos;m late .
things with jenna took longer than i thought .
i can &apos;t stop thinking about her story .
cheese ball ?
sure .
her story is so raw , which is surprising ,
coming from somebody so guarded .
was she always like that ?
we were never that close .
can &apos;t imagine what her life must be like .
how does a family just get over something like that ?
they don &apos;t .
can we just talk about something else ?
yeah .
dinner &apos;s almost ready .
you sure i can &apos;t help you with that ?
it &apos;s actually easier if i do it myself .
owls do that when they dive for prey .
okay , i think i &apos;d feel safer on a bench at the bus station .
i told you i &apos;d spring for a hotel .
and i said no , thank you .
all right , jungle jane , what gives ?
what do you mean ?
you &apos;re the queen of heels and handbags ,
but out here you &apos;re dora the explorer .
you have any other personalities i should know about ?
i spent five summers at fat camp .
you ?
my nickname was &quot; hefty hanna . &quot;
you didn &apos;t have to tell me that .
i want you to know who i am .
i never met my father .
when i was 5,
my mom dropped me off at my aunt &apos;s house to go shopping .
she never came back .
when i was 10 , she sent me a birthday card .
it said , &quot; happy birthday . love , mom . &quot;
that &apos;s it .
i should have been pissed , right ?
i was so happy to get that card .
it was postmarked from arizona .
that &apos;s the last place i know she was .
hey , everybody , can you help me get my friend up here
to sing along ?
no . no way .
they love you already .
i don &apos;t do karaoke .
come on , emily .
take a walk on the wild side .
i am so gonna get you back for this .
jenna might not even be here till morning .
&quot; glyceraldehyde &quot; ?
with the &quot; c &quot; on the double letter ,
it is 32 points .
plus the triple word score gets me 96 points .
&quot; goofball . &quot;
you can put down 104 points for me .
thanks for the &quot; g. &quot; i &apos;ve been waiting for it .
eighteen points ,
times the triple word score ,
plus the 50 @-@ point bingo bonus .
well . 104 points .
good for you .
i like this game .
i hope you don &apos;t take this the wrong way , but ...
you can &apos;t be comfortable
in that jacket and that tie .
i &apos;m fine .
top or bottom ?
i &apos;m just kidding .
are you sure ?
i &apos;m sure .
do you have ... ?
we want ?
we need .
anybody interesting ?
i haven &apos;t decided yet .
maybe i can help .
i thought your saturdays
were saved for coffee and cartoons with fitz .
why are you avoiding him ?
i &apos;m not exactly avoiding him .
he &apos;s called you three times since you &apos;ve been here .
okay , i &apos;m avoiding him .
he &apos;s helping jenna with this thing ,
and he keeps asking questions about her .
&quot; was it really toby &apos;s fault ?
can you imagine how hard her life must be ? &quot;
i mean ... oh , my god !
so what do you say ?
i lie . over and over again .
do you want to tell him the truth ?
doesn &apos;t matter . we made a promise .
so you want to ?
i feel like i need to .
then you don &apos;t have a choice .
i don &apos;t know about spencer or hanna ,
but ... if you trust him , i do too .
have you been up all night ?
&quot; you &apos;re getting colder . &quot;
what ?
who is &quot; a &quot; ?
i @-@ i have no idea .
i love this band .
me too .
they &apos;re playing in the city next month .
we should go and see &apos; em .
i &apos;d like to , but , you know ...
what ?
we might see people we know there .
i can &apos;t risk being seen with you .
i thought you understood .
i so understand . believe me , i do .
but hearing you say that ...
i didn &apos;t mean to hurt your feelings .
i had an amazing time last night .
and i would really like to keep seeing you .
like this ?
always in the middle of nowhere , hiding ?
it &apos;s the only way i can do it .
i &apos;m not ashamed of who i am .
but i used to be .
and if we have to hide like this all the time ,
i &apos;m gonna start to feel that way again .
i really like you , emily .
i like you too .
and i &apos;ll always be here for you .
but i think it has to be as friends .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ve been leaving you messages all morning .
i know .
i &apos;ve been avoiding you .
why ?
what &apos;s going on , aria ?
you &apos;re starting to scare me .
i &apos;ve been walking around your block the past two hours ,
trying to talk myself out of what i &apos;m about to tell you .
because i know if i do ,
there &apos;s a chance that you &apos;ll never look at me the same again .
aria .
you still haven &apos;t heard anything ?
please let me know the second that you do .
where have you been ?
with caleb .
sleeping on a bus bench ?
we camped out .
don &apos;t ever do that again .
i have been up all night looking for you ,
scared to death of what might have happened to you--
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
i &apos;m going to shower , and then i &apos;m changing ,
and then i &apos;m going back .
no , you &apos;re not !
you know , i don &apos;t get you !
you of all people should understand his situation .
you were lucky enough to get out of yours .
or have you forgotten ?
caleb .
hanna ?
no . this is her mother .
if it gets too uncomfortable at home ,
i &apos;m here for one more night .
you can always come back .
i might actually take you up on that .
i &apos;m sorry this was a bust .
it wasn &apos;t a complete wash .
to be honest ...
it was really fun to kick your ass at scrabble .
i was not expecting that .
me neither .
hey , it was not a complete ass @-@ kicking , by the way .
goodbye , spencer .
thanks for letting me come to dinner .
did it for hanna , not you .
i know .
uh , is it okay if i grab a soda ?
help yourself .
you have been for weeks , right ?
you can stay here .
for a short time , in the guest room .
but if you even think about hurting my daughter ,
i will make sure you regret it .
i believe you .
thank you .
i try not to look back , but ...
if there &apos;s anything that i could change in my life ,
it would be that night .
i love you .
and nothing you just said to me changes that .
thank you for looking at me tonight
the same way you did yesterday .
i &apos;ll see you in the morning .
sleep tight .
good night , mrs. marin .
you can call me ashley .
i can &apos;t do this anymore .
it &apos;s over .
i &apos;m out .
why is there a police car in the driveway ?
did they talk to ian ?
did they find out that he was at hilton head with ali ?
no .
because he wasn &apos;t with alison ,
he was with me .
he lied to protect me .
i was pregnant that summer , and ...
we went there to get an abortion .
i lost the baby before we went to the doctor .
that &apos;s why this baby is so important to me .
oh , spencer .
we &apos;re trying to help you , but
you need to start being completely honest with us .
police are waiting in the living room .
they know you lied to them .
honey , they know that you were seeing ian .
what &apos;s going on in there ?
did she send anything else ?
just the s.o.s.
&quot; breaking news , bitches . &quot;
&quot; spencer hastings now a person of interest &quot;
&quot; in my death . &quot;
&quot; &apos; a. &apos; &quot;
what &apos;s going on in there ?
did she send anything else ?
just the s.o.s.
&quot; breaking news , bitches . &quot;
&quot; spencer hastings now a person of interest &quot;
