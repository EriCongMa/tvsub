clarify something for me .
isn &apos;t the point of a communal meal
the exchange of ideas and opinions ?
an opportunity to consider important issues of the day ?
it is .
you just kind of put a damper on things
when you said , &quot; the next person i see talking
with food in their mouth will be put to death . &quot;
well , we could argue about who said what all night long ,
but to set things back on course ,
i will propose a new topic of conversation .
great .
what is the best number ?
by the way , there &apos;s only one correct answer .
5,318,008 ?
wrong .
the best number is 73 .
you &apos;re probably wondering why .
no . uh @-@ uh . we &apos;re good .
73 is the 21st prime number .
its mirror , 37 , is the 12th , and its mirror , 21,
is the product of multiplying--
hang on to your hats-- seven and three .
eh ? eh ? did i lie ?
we get it .
73 is the chuck norris of numbers .
chuck norris wishes .
in binary , 73 is a palindrome :
&quot; one @-@ zero @-@ zero @-@ one @-@ zero @-@ zero @-@ one &quot;
which backwards is &quot; one @-@ zero- zero @-@ one @-@ zero zero one &quot;
exactly the same .
all chuck norris backwards gets you is : &quot; sirron kcuhc . &quot;
just for the record ,
when you enter 5,318,008 on a calculator ,
upside @-@ down it spells &quot; boobies &quot; &quot;
remember when you were wondering
why the girls didn &apos;t want to eat with us tonight ?
yeah , i get it now .
i love your little heart locket , bernadette .
oh , thanks .
howard gave it to me .
it &apos;s the cutest thing .
every time i have dinner with his mom ,
the next day i get jewelry .
did you know that the iconic valentine &apos;s heart shape
is not actually based on the shape of a human heart ,
but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over ?
oh , so i spent seventh grade
dotting my i &apos;s with little asses ?
cool .
hey , penny , how &apos;s it going ?
hey , zack , what are you doing here ?
my dad &apos;s company prints the menus for this place .
i &apos;m just dropping off some new ones laminated .
makes &apos; em easier to clean if people throw up on &apos; em .
guess how i got the idea ?
yeah , i got it , i got it .
uh , zack , these are my friends bernadette and amy .
hi .
hey .
hoo .
okay , well , it was good to see you .
yeah , you , too .
he &apos;s really cute . how do you know him ?
oh , we went out a couple of times .
i &apos;m often flummoxed by current slang .
does &quot; went out &quot; mean &quot; had intercourse &quot; ?
yes .
no , no .
but in this case , yes .
interesting .
and was it not satisfactory ?
no , it was great .
he just didn &apos;t really challenge me on an intellectual level .
couldn &apos;t you just fool around with him and then listen to npr ?
wouldn &apos;t help . zack can &apos;t even spell npr .
it &apos;s what i do with howard .
i &apos;m much smarter than he is .
but it &apos;s important to protect his manhood .
hoo .
what &apos;s the matter ?
i &apos;m suddenly feeling flushed .
my heart rate is elevated , my palms are clammy ,
my mouth is dry .
in addition , i keep involuntarily saying &quot; hoo . &quot;
oh , we know what &apos;s causing that , don &apos;t we ?
it &apos;s no mystery .
i obviously have the flu
coupled with sudden @-@ onset tourette &apos;s syndrome .
did you hear about the accident at the bio lab ?
no .
what happened ?
they were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes
and one of the techs got bit .
did he get superpowers ?
no , he got five stitches and a tetanus shot .
oh . well , that &apos;s disappointing .
why ?
well , you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab ,
you kind of want to turn into a superhero .
yeah , but who &apos;d want to become rat @-@ man ?
who wouldn &apos;t ?
you could zip through a maze in nothing flat ,
squeeze through really small holes ,
and shut down restaurants in a single bound .
and the best part is , if i were rat @-@ man ,
you could be my sidekick , mouse boy .
mouse boy ?
you don &apos;t like &quot; mouse boy &quot; ?
how about &quot; kid vermin &quot; ?
first of all , if we had superpowers ,
i wouldn &apos;t be the sidekick . you &apos;d be the sidekick .
rat @-@ man is nobody &apos;s sidekick .
leonard , settle this .
of the two of us , who &apos;s the obvious sidekick ?
yeah , leonard , who ?
12 years after high school , and i &apos;m still at the nerd table .
aren &apos;t you slicing that man &apos;s brain a little too thin ?
it &apos;s too thin if i were making
a foot @-@ long brain sandwich at quiznos .
for examination under a two @-@ photon microscope , it &apos;s fine .
well , you &apos;re the expert .
if the correct way to do it is the wrong way , then i yield .
very well .
if you die and donate your body to science ,
i promise to slice your brain like canadian bacon .
thank you .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have to take my temperature .
are you monitoring your circadian rhythms
in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity ?
i did that one summer .
ah , youth .
no , i experienced some distressing symptoms last night ,
so i &apos;m checking my vital signs every hour .
i &apos;d be happy to create a chart
and participate in a differential diagnosis .
oh , that sounds like fun .
all right .
what were the symptoms ?
elevated heart rate , moist palms , dry mouth
and localized vascular throbbing .
localized to what region ?
ears and genitalia .
interesting .
not body parts that usually team up .
what about environmental factors ?
describe the scene for me .
i was sitting in a restaurant with penny and bernadette ,
drinking water -- carbonated as it was a special occasion .
penny &apos;s friend zack stopped by and said hello
and i said &quot; hoo . &quot;
who ?
zack .
then why did you ask ?
ask what ?
who .
zack .
all right , let &apos;s start over .
what did you say when zack walked in ?
&quot; hoo . &quot;
zack .
why do you keep saying &quot; zack &quot; ?
because you keep saying &quot; who . &quot;
i &apos;m not saying &quot; hoo &quot; now .
i said &quot; hoo &quot; last night .
and the answer was zack , correct ?
there was no question .
i simply said &quot; hoo . &quot;
all right , i think i have enough to go on .
possible explanations for your symptoms are ,
in descending order of likelihood :
hyperthyroidism , premature menopause ,
hosting an alien parasite or --
and i only include it for the sake of covering
absolutely all bases -- sexual arousal .
where would i have picked up an alien parasite ?
there you are .
let me ask you a question . what are you most afraid of ?
i don &apos;t know . um ...
nuclear war .
accidentally being buried alive .
any of those movies where you get that phone call
that says you &apos;re going to die .
and then you do .
no . something very specific
that we both know you ,
rajesh koothrappali , are terrified of .
well , type two diabetes runs in my family .
the thought of losing a toe ...
spiders ! you &apos;re afraid of spiders !
what the heck is this ?
a jar with a big spider in it , of course .
bravery test .
first one to take his hand out is the sidekick .
are you crazy ?
perhaps .
are you scared ?
no . but it &apos;s a stupid test .
oh , really ? what if the earth was in danger
and the only way to save it was
to stick your hand in a jar with a spider ?
oh , yeah ? what if the earth was in danger
and the only way to save it was to take a shower
in the locker room and let other guys see you naked ?
oh , come on . that &apos;s never gonna happen .
put your hand in the jar
or forever be revealed as my sidekick .
all right , i will .
how did you get so brave all of a sudden ?
it &apos;s easy .
the spider &apos;s crawling up your arm .
get it off ! get it off !
please , raj !
please .
my blood work shows thyroid function normal .
cortisol levels normal .
how about your follicle @-@ stimulating hormone levels ?
sheldon , i am not going through menopause .
are you sure ?
you said that with the testy bark of an old biddy .
i think we need to face the cold , hard truth :
i was sexually aroused by penny &apos;s friend zack .
hang on . i don &apos;t know
that we &apos;ve given the alien parasite hypothesis
a fair shake .
let &apos;s look at this logically .
i have a stomach ; i get hungry .
i have genitals ; i have the potential for sexual arousal .
a cross we all must bear .
you know , in difficult moments like this ,
i often turn to a force greater than myself .
religion ?
star trek .
did you see star trek : the motion picture ?
no . don &apos;t .
it &apos;s terrible . however ...
in it , we learn that
when spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic
by feelings bubbling up from his human half , he suppresses them
using the vulcan mental discipline of kolinahr .
are you suggesting we live our lives
guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction ?
&quot; cheap science fiction &quot; ?
what are you doing ?
using kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment .
is it possible that your concern for me at this moment
is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy ?
i hadn &apos;t considered that .
give me a moment .
all right , i &apos;ve considered it .
and ?
i reject it .
you reject it because you don &apos;t feel jealousy ,
or because you are suppressing jealousy ?
i think i &apos;ll eat my lunch at home .
that &apos;s not your lunch , sheldon ;
those are the cadaver brain specimens .
as they were incorrectly sliced ,
you can see how i could mistake them for my sashimi .
hello .
hey .
isn &apos;t tomorrow your usual laundry night ?
the supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener .
if this one under @-@ or over @-@ softens ,
i &apos;ll need time to make things right .
that &apos;s thinking ahead .
the alternative would be to think backwards .
that &apos;s just remembering .
so how &apos;s amy ?
amy &apos;s changed .
i might have to let her go .
oh , no . why ?
i thought she was a highly evolved creature
of pure intellect , like me .
but recent events indicate that
she may be a slave to her baser urges .
like you .
just going to skip over that insult .
what insult ?
yeah ! that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to skip over it .
are you saying that amy is ...
oh , what &apos;s the scientific word ...
forget science . she &apos;s horny .
oh ! okay . wow .
it &apos;s simple biology . there &apos;s nothing i can do about it .
are you sure ?
what are you suggesting ?
i &apos;m suggesting there might be something
you could do about ... amy &apos;s urges ?
it &apos;s illegal to spay a human being .
yeah . that &apos;s not what i had in mind .
you mean ... something i could do .
exactly .
well , i was hoping to avoid this .
but i might as well get it over with .
thank you , penny .
i &apos;ll let you know what happens .
oh , amy , you lucky girl .
yes . this is dr. sheldon cooper .
is this the zack johnson
who used to have coitus with my neighbor penny ?
sorry to bother you .
hello . i &apos;m looking for a zack johnson
who used to have coitus with my neighbor penny .
coitus . it means intercourse .
and i have a feeling i &apos;m speaking to the right zack .
this is sheldon cooper .
fine . shelly .
yes , that does sound like a girl &apos;s name .
no , it doesn &apos;t bother me .
yes , &quot; smelly shelly &quot; does bother me .
let me tell you why i &apos;m calling .
i &apos;d like to know if you &apos;d be interested
in having sex with amy farrah fowler .
amy farrah fowler .
yes , that is a girl &apos;s name .
good grief . it &apos;s like trying to talk to a dolphin .
really ?
this is going to decide who &apos;s the hero and who &apos;s the sidekick ?
you got a better idea ?
every idea is better than this idea .
ding !
wait . what the hell is &quot; ding &quot; ?
it &apos;s a bell .
i don &apos;t think this kind of wrestling has a bell .
fine . how do you want to start ?
i say , uh , how about one , two , three , go ?
one @-@ two @-@ three @-@ go ? that &apos;s for babies .
okay , how about , uh ...
on your mark , get set , go ?
that &apos;s for a footrace . if you want to race ,
we have to go outside .
no , it &apos;s chilly outside . didn &apos;t bring my jacket .
oh , for crying out loud .
what kind of superhero needs a jacket ?
what kind of superhero says , &quot; dibs on the red tights !
dibs on the red tights ! &quot;
all right , how about this ? ready , wrestle .
wait . are we starting now ? or is that what you &apos;re going to say
when we do start , or ...
we &apos;re starting now !
don &apos;t yell at me !
suppose there are worse ways to spend a friday night .
none come to mind .
look at this stamp . on what authority
are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter ?
i &apos;m sure it &apos;ll wash off .
little comfort tonight .
i look like a hell &apos;s angel .
there &apos;s zack .
are you sure this is what you want to do ?
it &apos;s not what i want to do ;
it &apos;s what i have to do .
go , amy farrah fowler .
follow your endocrine system .
thank you , sheldon . you &apos;re a good friend .
please don &apos;t drag this out .
this is never going to come off .
excuse me ?
zack , i am amy farrah fowler . we met the other night .
i have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge .
until i met you , my decisions were founded in logic and reason
and yet here i stand before you , 130 pounds of raging estrogen ,
longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus
and make shakespeare &apos;s metaphorical
beast with two backs .
my gluteus what ?
on the other hand ,
as i look at the blank , ape @-@ like expression on your face ,
i have decided to adopt the vulcan practice of kolinar .
good @-@ bye , zack .
bye .
hoo .
that should hold me for a while .
i &apos;m legally obligated to inform you
that i took a karate lesson when i was 11 .
i &apos;d be a regular ninja by now
if my mom could &apos;ve arranged a carpool .
oh , yeah ?
well , i &apos;ve been taking pilates class at the rec center ,
and my abs look like sections of a hershey bar .
oh , yeah ? won &apos;t matter , you &apos;re going down !
no , uh @-@ uh , you &apos;re going down !
if anybody &apos;s going to go down , it &apos;s going to be you .
fellas . it &apos;s been 30 minutes . nobody &apos;s touched each other .
i &apos;m glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain
and return to the realm of pure intellect .
as am i.
what are you doing ?
an experiment .
nope . nothing . never mind .
you realize you can &apos;t win .
i prefer to think that i can &apos;t lose .
you &apos;re wrong .
it &apos;s only a matter of time
before you fall into rat @-@ man &apos;s rat trap .
you pathetic fool !
if there were a rat @-@ catcher , wouldn &apos;t it catch rat @-@ man ?
just because i didn &apos;t express myself well
doesn &apos;t mean my underlying point was invalid !
you bloviating buffoon !
you narcissistic nincompoop !
you crimson coward !
oh , leonard , wake up ,
