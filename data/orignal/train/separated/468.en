Oh, please...
Please.
Oh, please...
Please!
Please! No--
Thank you.
Ok, just put everything on the counter
and I'll put it away later.
I like your altar.
Thank you.
Yeah, there's still a lot to do
before the party next week, and...
I'm scared.
I've never had the whole team here before.
Why are you doing a Day of the Dead theme?
Well, uh, my stepfather's family
always made a big deal of it in Mexico,
and my name is Penelope Garcia, after all, so...
Hey, could you check my refrigerator
and see if I have enough hot sauce?
You have some jalapeno sauce here next to this jar of eyeballs,
but I think you're gonna need more,
depending on which guacamole you plan on making.
You ok?
You didn't even flinch.
JJ's right.
I told her I wanted to go scary this Halloween,
and she just laughed at me
and she said that I don't have a scary side.
I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better,
you probably do.
Yeah. Really?
The building blocks of the human personality are complex, varied,
and multi-faceted.
It's essential to one's mental health
to want to express these hidden personalities,
and it's a fact of nature that everybody has one.
Everybody? You have one?
Oh, absolutely. Yeah.
Ok. Ok. I want to see it.
I want to see Dr. Spencer Reid's hidden personality.
Uh--you, uh-- right here?
Like right now you want to see it?
I have fake blood running down my cheeks right here, right now.
Ok.
Once you see it, you can't unsee it.
Ok.
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking, did that guy just fire 5 shots?
Or did that guy just fire 6 shots?
You're gonna have to ask yourself a question.
Do you feel lucky, punk?
That's Clint Eastwood, in "Dirty Harry."
I mean, I know it's not as effective
as my dominant personality...
He, look, we gotta go.
But I feel like there's--
These eyeballs, do they need to be refrigerated--
No. Let's go.
Oh, I recognize that face from somewhere.
It's good to have you back, Hotch.
It's good to be back. Thanks.
And under the heading of no rest for the weary...
A woman was found dead yesterday near Provo, Utah,
buried under a pile of rocks.
Her face was smashed. Her head was smashed.
Pretty much everything smashed.
24 hours later she's still a Jane Doe?
No personal items were found at the scene,
and the severity of her injuries
made facial recognition impossible.
So Provo missing persons has like zero intel on her.
Well, it looks like the victim was tortured.
Lacerations on both arms and a burn in the neck area.
It could be the killer's way of silencing her,
literally and figuratively.
The robe she's in almost looks ceremonial.
Yeah, the unsub must have changed her clothing.
Could be a straight-up woman hater.
Took away her clothes, her voice, her identity.
And then covered her with rocks.
Might be a concealment or an expression of remorse.
It looks like a makeshift tomb, if you ask me.
Have there been similar killings in the area?
None that we know.
I'm impressed, Hotch.
How'd you get the brass to let us investigate
a single, isolated murder?
I told them that the ritualistic nature
means that he's forensically sophisticated and organized
and he's likely killed before.
And likely will kill again.
Which means we can't waste time. Wheels up in 20.
"After all, what is every man but a horde of ghosts...
Oaks that were acorns that were oaks."
Walter de la Mare.
Single victim, unidentified.
Not much to go on.
Let's start with the basics.
Those rocks were heavy, so our killer's most likely male,
probably in good physical shape.
There could be more than one unsub.
Newsflash. We just got lucky with dental records.
Our Jane Doe is Gloria Carlyle,
24-year-old grammar school teacher.
One red flag, and it's pretty scarlet, carmine, crimson.
She used to belong to a utopian-style sect in town.
She joined it right out of high school.
Used to belong?
Mm-hmm. She left the sect 3 months ago
and she moved in with her boyfriend.
Do we know the boyfriend's whereabouts?
He's in Alaska, so his alibi's as solid
as a pre-globally-warmed glacier.
Garcia, is this sect run by a man named Herbert Sykes?
Wonder boy, yes, it is. How'd you know that?
5 years ago a teenage girl was found dead
on the grounds of his compound.
It was determined to be an honor killing of sorts.
The girl was stoned to death.
The rocks appear to be the cause of death
in Gloria's murder as well.
The red flag just got redder.
All right, Dave, you and Blake find out what you can
about Gloria Carlyle from the medical examiner.
Morgan and Reid, go to the crime scene.
JJ and I will talk to Gloria's family
as well as have a chat with Herbert Sykes.
A couple of fossil hunters nosing around up here found her.
Those the rocks?
My men moved them off her body.
But that's all anyone's touched them.
These are sedimentary conglomerates with rounded clasts.
If you say so.
That means that geologically speaking,
they don't belong up here.
The rest of this canyon is tertiary rhyolite volcanics,
which means the unsub must have brought these rocks with him.
Which would be noisy and time-consuming.
So the unsub obviously felt comfortable enough up here
to take the time that he needed.
He's probably been here before.
Sergeant, how wide was the radius of your initial search?
We canvassed out about 200 yards in all directions.
We didn't find anything.
Well, we may need to push that out a little further.
I was, uh, shocked
when I heard.
Even though Gloria chose to leave the community,
her loss will be felt.
We spoke to Gloria's parents a little while ago
and they said that you had had a fight with Gloria
the day that she left the community.
This had something to do with your claim of divine heritage?
I am the spiritual leader of my community.
As such, I often speak allegorically or in parables.
But Gloria took the divine heritage business literally.
Yes. She dug around in my family history looking for, uh...
Who knows what.
God, Buddha...Zeus.
We were also told
that Gloria was threatened by members of the community
when she announced her intention to leave.
I have no knowledge of that.
So the friends she made there weren't told to shun her?
Let's talk about the stoning death 5 years ago.
Since you seem to know the answers to the questions you're asking,
why don't you tell me?
Look, the guilty party was sent to prison,
where he belongs.
What else do you want to know?
Reviewing the original case file,
you were less than forthcoming
in the initial stages of the investigation.
You hired a public relations firm in the wake of the murder.
It took me years to build my community.
My investment was-- is substantial.
I was not going to watch it go under
because of one tragic incident.
I think we're done.
We may have some more questions,
so please keep yourself available for the next few days.
The law firm of Gordon, Foxman, and Mendelovich.
Not local yokels-- Wall Street.
Drag my name through the mud on this
like you did 5 years ago,
and they'll be in touch.
Mr. Sykes, we're investigating a murder,
and I don't speak in parables,
so this should be very easy to understand.
If you interfere with us in any way,
I will see to it that you are charged with and prosecuted
for obstruction of justice.
I've seen some bad ones in my 15 years,
but this was...bad.
What was the C.O.D.?
It's hard to pinpoint.
Virtually every bone in her body was crushed
and every major organ ruptured.
My guess is skull fracture, but honestly,
any one of these internal injuries might have killed her.
What about the lacerations?
Could they have been defensive wounds?
No, they were in a distinct pattern.
Quite deep and severe on the radius and ulna,
but carefully placed so as not to cause death.
There would be substantial bleeding from a wound like that?
Absolutely.
Yet there was minimal blood at the crime scene.
The victim suffered the lacerations and burning somewhere else
and was taken to the canyon to be killed.
But why not make it one-stop shopping?
Transporting her alive, even a short distance,
would increase the risk significantly.
The tox report did show traces of chlorpromazine in her system.
A tranquilizer. That's what he used to control her.
There's something else I wanted you to see.
Fingernail polish was removed.
But crudely.
A mixture of citrus juice and vinegar.
And where that didn't do the trick,
the polish was roughly scraped off with a sharp object.
Not how I remember my ex-wives removing their polish.
Well, this was done to her, not by her.
What used to be up here?
The dirt road leading in seems rather substantial.
Salt mining. Hauled this stuff out by the truckloads.
These hills filled a hell of a lot of salt shakers.
Actually, less than 6% of salt in the united states is used for food.
The vast majority of it goes for de-icing roads and snow control.
Guys.
Over here.
You're right.
The killer's been here before.
And he seems to have a preference for blondes.
Kylie, this one looks good.
I like it.
Me, too.
I think we could find something in here for sure.
Should we check it out, then?
Yeah.
Ok.
Let's go.
Sorry, ma'am. That's a reference book.
It can't leave the library.
Not even for one night?
No, ma'am. But there is a photocopy machine on the main floor
if you want to make copies. 10 cents a page.
Can we make copies?
You know what, sweetie? I gotta get ready for work.
But we'll come back tomorrow. Thank you.
You promise?
Promise.
I hate when people can't be flexible.
I mean, who is it gonna hurt to take the book for one night?
How much is this book?
Excuse me?
To buy it. How much to buy the book?
This is a library, sir, not a bookstore.
Let's go, sweetie.
Whoa, hold on, lady.
Don't touch me.
I'll make the photocopies for you.
Give me your phone number and we can set up a time to--
Time to go, sweetie.
Dave, are you and Blake still at the M.E.'s office?
Just leaving now.
Yeah, stay put.
Morgan and Reid found another body
near the first crime scene.
22-year-old Abby Stafford.
She was a student at the University of Utah.
Quick I.D.
Yeah, her handbag was found near the body.
Any idea when she died?
Morgan said the body's been there for a while.
Her roommate says that she's been missing for a week.
The body's on its way to you now.
Another rock burial?
It appears she jumped or was thrown off of a cliff.
The autopsy's tomorrow,
but the M.E. might be able to tell us something now.
Ok, we'll stay put. By the way,
have you had your audience yet with the Dalai Lama?
Yeah. He claims to know nothing about the Gloria Carlyle murder.
Surprise, surprise.
What's your take, Hotch?
Well, I think he's telling the truth.
You sound fairly certain.
Yeah, money means more to Sykes than ideology.
He took a big financial hit
after the stoning death a few years ago.
The last thing he wants is any more trouble.
Protecting his brand.
Utopia incorporated.
We'll check in when the new body gets here.
Thanks.
I'm sorry I grabbed you before.
Leave me the hell alone
or I'm gonna go back inside and call security.
It's not against the law to apologize.
It's called stalking.
And it is against the law.
Stop following me.
You need to calm down.
I mean it.
If I see you again, I'm calling the cops.
JJ, were you able to contact Abby Stafford's family?
No. They're vacationing somewhere in Europe.
We're tracking them down. But I did talk to a friend of hers.
She said Abby was a conservative, studious type.
No drama. No enemies.
I just got off the phone with Rossi.
The M.E. says the new victim died roughly a week ago.
Had the same laceration marks and throat burning,
but the wounds weren't anywhere near
as severe as Gloria Carlyle's.
He was still warming to the task.
Well, our unsub definitely has a type.
Young, blond, pretty.
Now, the elements in common
to both murders aren't giving us much.
Let's concentrate on the deviations.
Ok. Well, um, Abby was thrown off a cliff.
Gloria was entombed.
The unsub left Abby in her own clothes
but changed Gloria into a robe.
The M.E. found another difference.
Apparently Gloria's fingernail polish
had been removed by the unsub.
Abby Stafford's hadn't been tampered with at all.
Well, Abby's death was quick and impersonal-- of the cliff.
No muss, no fuss.
But Gloria was slowly crushed.
He took his time to make her suffer.
All the deviations in Gloria's murder involve increased ritual.
It's got to be feeding a fantasy of some kind.
It explains why the torture was more intense with Gloria.
The ritual fed the fantasy, the fantasy fed the rage.
If that's the case, this guy's evolving fast.
No...
The hour is upon us.
With this, I send your soul back to hell.
No--
Thanks.
Same signature.
Lacerations.
Burned throat.
He's dressed in a robe.
But this is a huge change in both M.O. and victimology.
Well, we knew the unsub probably wouldn't chance
going to the canyon again, but a downtown city park?
It's a complete 180.
Garcia, what's the lowdown on Parker Mills?
Oh, you got the low part right.
Do you remember in science class with the Petri dishes
and the mold and the algae and the slime and the gunk?
Yeah, I appreciate the scientific perspective,
but what are you saying?
I'm saying grade-a pervert.
There is not a ladies underwear drawer
that this man did not want to dive face-first in.
So I'm guessing a rap sheet?
As long as the telescope
he used to peer into the girls locker room.
If it is something scuzzy, Parker Mills has done it.
Peeping Tom, a stalker,
non-consensual frottage,
which, btw, is rubbing your body
On, near, or against the vicinity of somebody else's--
Let me call you back, Garcia.
Hey, check this out.
This burn was shallow and more distinct.
There's a pattern.
A design.
The victims weren't just being burned.
They're being branded.
So this guy's killing men now.
Parker Mills must have had a hidden or perceived connection
to the other victims.
Or Mills got in the way somehow and had to be killed
so the unsub could return to his preferred victim type.
Then why bother with the cutting and throat burning?
Excuse me.
Interesting.
What is it?
Tox report on Abby Stafford.
Our conservative, studious girl had cocaine in her system
at the time of her death.
We're looking for a physically fit male
from his late 20s to mid 30s.
He's brazen, confident, and organized.
This person may be a moral vigilante.
Abby Stafford had drug issues.
Gloria Carlyle moved in with her boyfriend.
Parker Mills was a sexual deviate.
Moral vigilantism typically has its roots
in repression and guilt.
This generally manifests itself
in low self-esteem and self-loathing.
By punishing others, the unsub may also be punishing himself.
He's also literally branding his victims.
We're not sure why, but he's likely marking them as his own.
His organizational skills suggest someone
who can get and keep a full-time job.
But the work is likely low level.
His impaired social development
would not allow him to move very far in the professional world.
Consequently, this is someone
most comfortable working in solitude,
having minimal interaction with others.
And this makes it a challenge to determine
how and where this person is choosing his victims.
The two female victims were reserved and studious.
Parker Mills lived quietly
in the margins of conventional society.
So the killer may frequent or work in locations
that attracts this type of person.
Uh, places of solitude, contemplation.
Museums, gardens and parks, bookstores.
His choice of a city square rather than a remote canyon
means he's gaining confidence.
But the recklessness of killing in such a public space
suggests that this confidence may be stemming from a delusion.
He may believe he's in a place and time
that makes him invulnerable.
And if his delusion is gaining in strength,
then his next killing may be riskier and more dramatic.
Thank you.
I told Dr. Reid he could use my office.
There must be 30 books piled up on my desk.
Well, that's either some light bedtime reading
or he's actually onto something.
You know, I was thinking about that branding thing.
Maybe it's like that book we had to read in school,
About the woman with the scarlet A.
No, that's unlikely.
The Scarlet Letter was a badge of shame
to be worn in public day after day.
Our unsub is killing his victims immediately after the branding.
There's something strange going on here.
Well, that may be the understatement of the week.
Gloria's vision was extremely poor.
Her driver's license specifies she had to wear
corrective lenses while operating a vehicle.
Eyeglasses.
It says here she wore contact lenses.
No contact lenses were found on her body or at the crime scene.
The unsub must have taken them out,
like he removed her nail polish.
But why would he do that?
No wristwatch was found at the crime scene either.
Nail polish, wristwatch, contact lenses.
What if he was trying to strip her of items
That reminded him of the modern era?
It could be part of his delusion.
Like changing her into a simple robe.
He needed to take Gloria back to a primitive time
before he could kill her.
Leland, there you are.
You need to get your new parking permit downstairs.
Ok. As soon as my shift's over.
No, do it now.
You keep putting it off and today's the last day.
I'll watch your area until you get back.
Guys, check this out.
What have you got?
The pattern in the branding mark has design characteristics
similar to family crests from the late middle ages.
I found this encyclopedia of heraldry and look.
It's the seal of William Stoughton, a magistrate.
Check when and where he's a magistrate.
Salem, massachusetts, 1692.
Stoughton was the lead prosecutor in the Salem witch trials.
So this unsub believes he's hunting witches.
Where is it?
Where's what?
The book!
The book
That was right there.
Where is it?
It's been checked out.
What?
A woman came in while you were gone,
said you told her yesterday that it was a reference book
and couldn't be checked out.
This is a lending library.
Remember?
Yeah, but--
Don't worry.
I logged the book into the system and gave it to her.
Our unsub chose the right role model.
Stoughton was the most ruthless of all of the Salem prosecutors.
Our killer's also emulating the methods of execution
at the time of the trials.
Witches were thrown off cliffs, hung, slowly crushed by rocks.
So the family crest thing, is that his way of honoring the guy?
It's more than that.
He may believe he's a direct descendent of Stoughton.
Garcia, were you able to run
a history yet of the Stoughton family tree?
It isn't so much a tree
as it is a giant sequoia--
Branches, twigs, roots, sticks, limbs,
pine cones, woodpecker holes.
There are literally
thousands of Stoughton's descendents out there.
Are there any in the Provo or Salt Lake City area?
Yeah, there's a handful,
but none of them fit the unsub's profile.
Can you send me the Stoughtons' ancestry chart?
Did you hear the part I said about the giant sequoia?
I can send it to you, but unless your laptop screen
is the size of a drive-in movie theater--
Send it anyway. We'll print out a hard copy here.
I'm going to send the side of the tree that migrated westward,
and do not say I did not warn you.
You're going to need a bigger copy machine.
Hon...
Baby?
Where are we?
"By the grace of the defenders of the faith,
"these two did engage in the detestable arts
called witchcraft and sorcery."
What?
"These sorceries were wickedly
and feloniously used against others."
What are you talking about?
"For such delving into witchcraft...
Witchcraft?
Is this statute made and provided."
No. No, this is crazy.
Please, just let us go.
W-wait.
Don't hurt us. No, don't hurt us.
You're making a mistake.
Don't.
No. No! Don't hurt us!
I've learned to stop asking questions about this guy.
What's up, Spence?
There's something strange
about this one branch of the family tree.
Garcia?
Talk to me. I am fluent in genius.
Roy and Bhecky Danary, they died in 1985,
leaving behind a son named William Danary,
but there's no record of what happened to him.
The Danarys were Peace Corps workers in Ecuador.
They died in a car accident there.
And you're right, their kid just sort of vanished.
Let me do some digging and I will call you back.
All right, well, we profiled the unsub as delusional.
What if Stoughton being a great-great-great-whatever
is just part of his delusion?
Or the discover of being a direct descendent
triggered the delusion.
He looked into his ancestry.
That would be easy to do here.
Salt Lake City has the largest family history library in the world.
Gloria Carlyle researched Herbert Sykes' ancestry.
Abby Stafford was a bookish college student.
Maybe that's where they crossed--at a library.
JJ, have Garcia get the names
of all the employees and volunteers
in the Provo and Salt Lake City library system
and cross-check those with descendents of William Stoughton.
Who are you?
Is that what this is about, the book?
Take it. I don't want it.
I'm just making my daughter a costume for Halloween.
That's all. We were just looking at the book for ideas.
Do you confess your crimes?
What crimes?
What are you talking about?
The court will be merciful if you confess.
I didn't do anything!
Oh, baby.
Listen to me. Just let my daughter go.
She's innocent. Just...
Let her go, and...
And you and I, we could talk, ok?
The indictment accuses both of you.
Do you willingly confess to your crimes?
Or must a confession be extracted from you?
You're crazy!
Hey, I have a thing.
What is it, Garcia?
No library employees are direct descendents of William Stoughton.
However, there's a volunteer with a fascinating family history there.
Leland Duncan, son of Orland and Clara Duncan,
Mormon missionaries.
But the Duncans aren't part of the Stoughton lineage.
But, a big kiss to who can guess
where they were doing their missionary work in 1985.
Ecuador.
Ding, ding, we have a winner.
Same time and place
as the Peace Corps couple that died and left a son.
So the Duncans adopted the boy and changed his name.
I'm sending you a current photo of Leland Duncan
along with his home address. There.
Thanks.
犹他州 普若佛市 彻蒙德路2384号 邮编84603
It's clear here.
Clear.
Ok. Thanks.
Apartment's empty, but Leland's definitely our guy.
What are you doing?
The court needs your confessions first.
Wait! Stop! No, I'll confess!
You don't have to do this.
I'll admit it.
I am a witch.
I'll call you back, Garcia.
Victim's Charlotte Novak. She's one of the librarians.
When was she last seen alive?
Around 3:30. She came to the main circulation desk
to put a book into the system,
then she went back to Leland's section.
What was the book?
"An illustrated history of witchcraft and sorcery."
That was his lure.
And anyone who took the bait was guilty of being a witch.
Where's the book?
Got checked out. Yvonne Carpenter.
All right, we need to find her address
and send units there immediately.
Was it my daughter?
Your daughter?
Was she the one who betrayed me?
Your child is also a witch.
Why would she help me?
No. She's a witch hunter.
Like you. She tried to remove the curses
I put on people.
You lie.
It's the truth.
I can prove it.
She has the mark of the angel.
It's on her hairline,
just behind her left ear. Look.
You see it, don't you?
Mark of the angel.
There's gotta be a secondary location somewhere.
I know, but Garcia said that Leland Duncan's adoptive parents
never had an address in the area.
Garcia.
Talk to me.
What was Clara Duncan's maiden name?
Andrews. Clara Andrews.
Did they ever live in the area?
I'm working on it. Give me a sec.
Yvonne Carpenter and her daughter are both gone.
My officer said the apartment showed signs of a struggle.
Your daughter has been released from custody.
When she wakes up, she is free to go.
Thank god.
The court accepts the confession of witchcraft.
What?
Your sentence of execution will be carried out at sundown.
No!
You said you'd show mercy!
Please don't do this!
Leland's adoptive mother, neither of her parents are still alive.
But get this-- they owned property
that is 2.8 miles from the canyon crime scene.
Who lives there now?
Nobody. It was condemned by the county 8 years ago.
As far as I can tell, it's abandoned.
All right, send the coordinates to Rossi, Blake, and Morgan.
Sending it.
Thanks.
It is time.
No! No! Don't!
Move aside!
Let us pass!
Guilty! She's guilty!
Wait. Wait.
Why is my daughter tied up?
You said she was free to go.
This is--
You are a witch.
She is your daughter. It's in the blood.
No!
The court promised mercy and you shall have it.
You will be burned first.
Burned? No!
You'll be spared seeing your daughter suffer the flames.
No! No!
She's a little girl.
She's never hurt anyone.
The accused have been convicted
of the horrible crime of witchcraft...
No...no...
and found guilty.
Sentence will now be carried out.
Please! Please don't do this!
No! Don't do this!
Leland Duncan! FBI!
Set the torch down and lay flat on your stomach.
Drop the torch now!
Do it.
No. No, stay.
They're just phantoms...
conjured by these witches to confuse you!
I'm coming.
Get me down! Get me down...
It's OK, I've got you.
You're gonna be OK. I've got you.
Kylie!
It's all right, baby.
My baby, wake up.
Wake up.
Mom...
Mommy...
So I looked it up.
No witches were ever burned at the stake in Salem.
Really?
Death by fire was strictly a European thing.
Moral of the story:
be selective where you practice your witchcraft.
What, what, what?
I thought you couldn't come.
Well, Jack got a last-minute sleep-over invitation,
so I hope it's OK.
Yes, of course, of course.
And happy almost birthday. I will keep it on the DL.
Thank you.
OK, everybody, I guess it's time to start.
Here you go, sir.
Thank you.
Uh...I want to thank everybody
for doing this with me,
and our altar's burning,
and I just feel so blessed to have you all here.
I will start. Uh...
This is my mom and dad.
I miss them.
And this is my cat Simba
with his usual bowl of soda pop.
He's a weird cat.
OK. Who's next?
OK. Well, uh, this is my sister Roslyn.
Ros.
She always dreamt that someday she'd live in Paree,
so, um...it didn't happen,
but I thought this would bring her some happiness.
Private First Class Darryl Jenson.
We lost him during the Tet Offensive.
What are the tickets?
Opening day next season, Wrigley,
right behind the home dugout.
Jenson was a diehard Cubs fan.
Sweet.
My mom.
She was the one who got me into crossword puzzles--
no erasing allowed--
which got me into linguistics.
You said we could bring more than one, right?
Oh, yes. This is a come one, come all altar.
It's Nikola Tesla.
I figured he's probably been inventing things on the other side,
so hopefully he'll bring something to us.
I guess that's me. OK.
I brought...
my pops.
He was a cigar aficionado, big time.
And, actually, Rossi,
he was also a huge cubbies fan,
so I was thinking maybe he and Private Jenson over there,
maybe they could go to the game together.
They can sort that out when they get here.
Well, I guess this is proof positive
that ancestry ain't all bad.
How about a toast to the... 30 or 40 of us?
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers. Cheers.
Salud.
