I think that you should take me home.
You know, I can't drive right now.
The police have many theories.
What was that about?
Shana.
She clearly doesn't believe my story.
She's trying to trip me up.
Did they not make the offer?
What offer?
Assistant coach.
The team took a vote.
Zack hit on me.
Were you trashed?
No.
If you want to spiral out of control
and self destruct, go right ahead.
But I am not going to let you take my mom down, too.
Oh, my God!
Push it up against the gate.
I asked Noel to break into Hanna's house.
Why would you do that?
I needed someone like Hanna's mom
to stop questioning what happened to me.
Why would Noel help you with this?
What was the plan if he'd got caught?
"I'm sorry, Mrs. Marin,
I just needed to borrow a butcher knife?"
You're a little loud.
You're a little crazy.
Spencer, your eye is getting worse.
Yeah, I see plenty out of the other one.
Hey, what's going on? How's your mom?
Freaked.
Guys, we needed to do this.
You saw Tanner cornering me at school.
She's trying to poke holes in our story.
Your story.
Oh, was that Noel?
Is that who you've been sneaking out of your house
in the middle of the night to meet?
What's that supposed to mean?
You've been spying on me?
Well, maybe now you'll understand
why I turned to Noel.
At least someone still has my back.
Ali.
What?
I see what's going on here.
One of my best friends doesn't even show up
to my S.O.S. call and the other one is...
shadowing me like I'm the enemy.
Maybe asking Noel to do this wasn't the perfect plan,
but I'm kind of running out of choices.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna call my dad back.
I'd like to do it outside,
but, Spencer, are you gonna follow me
or have you already set up a camera for that?
You know, she never even answered that question about Noel.
The only thing I can't figure out
is how did he get time to break into this place
and lock us into those stables.
Spencer, it wasn't Noel's helmet in those stables.
I mean, we should be wondering if Melissa--
My sister wasn't the one who hired Noel Kahn
to terrorize Hanna's mother.
I don't know, for all we know she could have asked Noel
to choke her that night in her living room.
She's clearly gone rogue.
I walked in on that, Spencer.
Okay? It wasn't Noel.
You're sure?
Hanna. Easy.
You know what?
Last time I checked this was still my bedroom,
till somebody else got in and invaded it.
Even the doorknob smells like her.
Why were you smelling the doorknob?
It's my mom. I've got to go.
Take me with you.
Hanna, you can't stay at my house.
Seriously, you guys, I have to get out of here.
Make sure she doesn't drink and dial.
I can't keep doing this.
You have to meet me half-way.
It's too dangerous
and I'm not taking anymore chances, okay?
It's too dangerous
and I'm not taking anymore chances, okay?
Shana, please, don't fight me on this.
第五季 第九集
Morning.
How'd you sleep?
Who says I'm up?
Is Alison in the shower?
I guess.
So...
I was thinking you girls should meet me at the mall
after school today.
Who's "You girls"?
You and Alison.
I thought it might be nice to treat ourselves
to something new for Ella and Zack's party.
I'm not going to that party.
What are you talking about? Why not?
Because I have a make-up test on Monday.
Hanna, I think Aria will be pretty hurt if you don't go.
She'll be fine.
Can't you study for it over the weekend?
Mom,
I told you she's not gonna care if I go or not, okay?
Hanna?
This is not the answer.
This is dangerous
and disturbing
and you know it's totally unacceptable.
Mom, I know.
Okay? You don't have to do all of this.
Okay, listen to me.
I get it now. All right?
I know what you and Alison
and your friends have been going through.
I was here in my own house
and I was terrified.
I know you're looking for an escape.
And honestly, I don't blame you.
But you can't afford to not be in control,
especially not now, when Alison's kidnapper is still out there.
But they'll catch him.
I promise you.
Han, where's your moisturizer?
Just use mine, Alison.
So when did you first meet Mr. Fitz?
Um, first day of class, junior year.
Your principal stated that, to his knowledge,
you engaged in an intimate relationship with Mr. Fitz
after he was no longer a teacher at the school.
I'm sorry, what does any of this have to do
with the incident at the Marin house last night?
We have several open cases right now.
And it's helpful to explore possible connections.
What's the possible connection here?
I can't say.
You can't say or you don't know?
Mrs. Montgomery, if you would prefer
to conclude this interview, that is your right to do so.
I will ask a judge if he--
No, no, that's okay.
Let's just get it over with.
Were you aware of Mr. Fitz seeing other students socially?
Students like Shana Fring?
What are you saying?
Is it possible that Mr. Fitz had intimate relations
with other students?
How would she know that?
No.
Do you ever recall seeing Mr. Fitz interacting with Shana--
He didn't serial date students.
He wasn't some creep
that was prowling the school hallways hitting on girls.
Aria, they're just questions.
刚看到诺埃尔 他肯定在这里
Are you next?
What?
Tanner's here again.
She's hoping for a mutiny, Spencer.
If that frizz-top-cop just gets one of us to cave--
I'm not caving.
Okay, but what about Aria?
She's totally icing us out.
Is there something going on between her and Hanna?
I don't know.
Well, neither does Hanna.
Or at least that's what she says.
How long are you gonna be staying there?
Where's your dad?
I played down what happened last night
so he wouldn't rush back.
What? It's not like I feel safe in my bedroom.
I need to go to class.
I've to leave early to see the eye doctor.
Spencer.
If one of us falls, we all fall.
And "A" Wins.
Did you guys come to school together?
No.
Caleb dropped her off.
She's the one you should be following.
All of our student coaches must maintain a high level
of academic standing.
Are you taking a language this semester?
Yes.
I'm in AP Spanish.
Ah, yes, right there. There it is.
You are apparently doing very well.
Felici...
Taciones.
Exactly.
You still working at the Brew?
Yes, but I can scale back my hours,
I mean, especially when it comes to meets.
How's the shoulder injury?
I'm much better.
Well, clearly your fellow Sharks want you back,
男生储物柜分配
in the pool or out.
But the final decision rests with me.
Are you free for practice on Tuesday?
Yes.
Then I guess you have a new job.
Felici--
I can't. I took German.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Tuesday. Don't be late.
Yeah.
Aria, can you slow down for a second please?
I'm late for class.
I think Mrs. Welch will understand.
Hey, Aria.
Hey, Mrs. Montgomery.
Hi, Noel.
Aria, you cannot lose your cool
when you're asked those questions.
Those weren't questions, Mom.
Ezra's on her hit list and she's wrong.
It's her job to find out as much as possible.
Oh, please, not you, too.
Aria, I know this is hard,
but sometimes we do have blind spots
when it comes to the people that we love.
Okay, I really need to get to class.
I'm already skipping fifth period
to help you set up for the party.
You're right.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye.
Has Toby been up here recently?
No, why?
How about the Board of Health?
I was gonna straighten up after I took a shower.
You can sit down...
somewhere.
No, I can't.
I just was stopping by on my way to the ophthalmologist.
Is there something growing in that pan?
Hanna tried to make nachos.
Caleb, this can't go on.
It's a frying pan.
I'll just-- I'll buy Toby's stepmom a new one.
I'm talking about Hanna.
She's a mess.
And she's been that way ever since you got back.
I think you have me confused with Alison.
No. I know the difference.
She's getting wasted in the middle of the day.
She's not wasted.
She's crashing into people that she cares about.
Okay. I understand her not wanting to toast Zack tonight, but--
Zack?
What does she have against Zack?
I meant, Aria, Aria's family.
You don't have to draw me a map.
Come on, Caleb, you're not dense.
You know what we're up against.
"A" is back and the cops are circling us
with a million questions.
Hanna cannot be stumbling around the halls of school
looking like she's on a bender in Cancun.
Hey, what's wrong with Cancun?
Don't knock it until you've been there.
She's making some scary mistakes.
She's a big girl.
Yeah. She's also a loose cannon.
And you're supplying her with gunpowder.
What?
She's not drinking alone, Caleb.
Look, I don't know what happened to you
when you were away.
That's right.
You don't know the first thing about it.
Okay.
And it's none of my business
and maybe I'm not one to judge,
but the thing is that I've always thought
that you were the best thing that ever happened to Hanna.
And it really hurts to watch you guys fight
whatever is eating at you like this.
But you guys used to draw strength from each other
and now it's...
I don't get this.
I got to take a shower.
So what's next for you?
Bio.
Lucky.
They make me take earth science
with a bunch of ninth graders.
It's really humiliating.
Uh, wait.
I'll walk you.
I don't need an escort.
Han, I'm sorry about what happened last night.
Okay? I'll pay for the window.
It's not about the window.
Your stupid stunts affect a lot of people.
Are we talking about your mom?
Or are you and Aria fighting about me?
I can help you. I can talk to her--
I don't want you doing anything at all.
I just want to be left alone.
And I think it's best if you just stay with one of the other girls.
Han...
What's happening to us?
Our group is falling apart.
Hey, Jenna.
It's Alison.
I didn't know that you had enrolled here in Rosewood.
I came back a few weeks ago.
Nobody seemed to notice.
But then again,
I didn't come back from the dead.
I'm sorry about Shana.
She meant a lot to me, too.
Thanks.
And I'm sorry for you.
I heard about the break-in last night.
It must be hard to come back here
knowing someone's still after you.
Wait.
How did you do it?
What?
Shana.
She was my friend before she met you.
How did you turn her against me?
I didn't.
You did.
别急着回来 坦纳有很多事想问你 都是关于莎娜的
You can sit out here and relax while your pupils dilate.
The doctor will be out here in about 10 minutes.
Okay. Thank you.
Emily?
Can I call you right back?
No!
I'm in Noel's car.
Emily, Jenna's here, okay, with another Jenna.
What?
They gave me these eye drops, okay.
And I thought that I was hallucinating but I'm not.
Stop. Listen to me.
I got his keys out of his locker
and searched his car.
He has pictures of Alison from when she was dead.
That makes no sense.
Oh, but seeing two Jennas does?
Define "Dead."
The last two years of her life.
He put them in the same envelope
as the tape he was listening to.
Why would he even have that stuff?
I don't know,
but I need to drop off his car keys
at the Lost and Found before he--
Fine, but then I need you to come right here.
I can't.
Emily, my eyes are not playing tricks with me, okay?
Something freaky is happening.
Em?
Hello?
Emily?
Sorry, I thought I just saw Noel coming out the door.
False alarm.
Spencer, you there?
Spencer?
So you think somebody help Jenna mess with her chronic?
Hey, Em, I've got to go.
But we can talk about this at the party.
Well, not at the party, but soon.
Hey.
Hey there.
Were you able to get more candles?
I did, but they only had scented ones.
How do we feel about smelling patchouli
while eating steak?
Yeah, I think we lose the candles.
This crowd looks better in the dark anyway.
Shoot. I got to go.
I'm gonna miss my hair appointment.
Oh. Well, we've got this covered.
Okay. Perfect.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Can I squeeze these in there?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
What are you doing?
I am updating the list.
Hanna can't make it.
Oh, no? Why not?
Uh, she said that she wasn't feeling well.
What's wrong with her?
I don't know. That's all she told me.
Oh, there you are finally.
Which room was it in? The chart?
Shh. They're in there.
Who's in there?
Jenna.
And Jenna.
Do you want to see what I found in Noel's car?
No, I can't even see my feet right now.
There.
Sydney?
Oh, hi, Emily.
Spencer.
What are you doing here?
She was my ride.
Is that a problem?
Yeah, kind of.
Unless you're driving a taxi.
When did you two become friends?
We should go--
Sydney, Emily asked you a question.
It sounded more like an accusation.
How come you never mentioned that you and Jenna were friends?
Maybe it never came up.
Maybe you should let her speak for herself.
Excuse me?
When you ask the organ grinder a question,
you don't really want to hear from the monkey.
Can we please leave?
Wait--
For more insults?
How long is it gonna take for you to both
realize that you're nervous around the wrong person?
I'm not Alison.
Come on, Syd.
"Hey, Caleb. Hey Hanna"
"How was your day?"
"My day was fine. How was yours?"
My day sucked, actually.
What happened?
Could we just watch this?
I'm not in the greatest mood.
Does that mood have to do with this party
that we're not going to tonight?
I wouldn't go to that party if you paid me.
And that's because?
Because I'm just not feeling it.
I have never seen you turn down
free food and a chance to dress up.
Last year for Cinco de Mayo
we drove 10 miles out of town to a gas station
just for the free burrito and a mini sombrero.
Why are you acting so weird about this?
What's weird is going to a party
and listening to toasts about eternal love
when one in three marriages end in divorce.
And what are you placing your bets on this one?
Hanna, does this have anything to do
with the guy that Ella's marrying?
He's just gross.
Okay, can you please be a little bit more specific?
He's a sleaze.
He gave me his number and he wants to meet up,
although no one seems to believe me.
I believe you, okay.
Why didn't you tell me?
It's not a big deal.
Yes, it is. This dude--
It's embarrassing.
Right, for him.
Then why am I the one who feels like crawling into a hole
and never coming out of it?
Let's just not talk about this anymore.
You know what?
Um, there's just not a lot to eat here.
So I'm gonna stop in Maggiano's
and get you your favorite.
You just-- you stay here
and you watch the chickiest chick flick that you can find.
All right? I'll be back soon.
Hey. I need your approval.
You look amazing.
Really? The necklace isn't too much?
No, it's perfect.
Okay, thanks.
Now I can relax.
When it comes to fashion, you are my guru.
Mom...
Are you sure that you want to do this?
I mean, maybe you should just wait.
Wait for what?
Aria, if you don't want me to get married...
No, it has nothing to do with you getting married.
It has-- it has to do with you marrying Zack.
How well do you really know him?
Why are you saying that?
Was he inappropriate with you?
No, not with me.
Maybe he was with Hanna.
Mom?
Why did you go there right away?
Um, there was an incident before we came here.
But I guess I just explained it away
to myself as pre-wedding jitters.
I'm so sorry, mom.
Yeah.
Me, too.
Hey, guys, make sure to keep the chafing dishes
on the side opposite the seafood.
Okay?
Are you with the catering crew?
No. I just walked in.
Oh, sorry, man.
We're closed tonight for a private event.
I'm not here for a latte.
I need to talk to you.
Uh, I'm actually kind of busy right now.
Yeah, it sounds like you've been busy.
Being the kind of scumbag
who's begging to get his ass kicked.
Excuse me?
Do you hit on all of Aria's friends
or is it just Hanna?
So I'm guessing you're the boyfriend.
I respect you coming here.
Seriously, I do.
But, honestly, this is just a misunderstanding.
That so?
She clearly took what I said way too seriously.
I was just joking.
I don't know, man.
She has a pretty good sense of humor
and she didn't find you funny at all.
Well, I think your girlfriend's just embarrassed.
I didn't want to have to do this, but, uh...
I was only reacting to the signals I was getting.
This isn't Hanna.
Sorry to break the bad news,
but your girlfriend slipped that into my pocket.
Don't worry.
I'm not coming back for the party.
Uh, where's the food?
Caleb, where have you been?
He's a piece of crap, but he has a strong jaw.
Caleb, you didn't.
Of course, I did.
Oh, my God.
Hanna, there's a problem.
Yeah, no kidding.
How is that going to explain that he got a fat lip?
I didn't write this.
I know.
Do you think that "A" decided to get in the mix?
Saw that Zack was a dirtbag
and decided to move things along?
This is why he got into my car.
Yep.
Couldn't you find somewhere to hide it?
And have Noel Kahn breaking into my bedroom?
No, thanks.
It's gonna take you forever to get to the lake house and back.
You can't miss this party.
I'll be there. Just save me a shrimp.
No, seriously.
I mean, Aria's already on a war path with Hanna.
If it looks like we're taking sides...
This is bigger than that.
These pictures decimate Alison's story
and once that falls apart, we are next.
These have to be in a safe place.
Fine. Just hurry.
Got a minute?
Why are you parked on my street?
I wanted to explain.
Is Jenna hiding in the trunk?
Please. Let me explain.
Why would I ever trust anything you said again?
I met Jenna a couple years ago.
I used to volunteer at the school for the visually-impaired.
Yeah, in Philadelphia.
I was there the day that Alison came to visit Jenna
and I pretty much glued Jenna back together when Alison left.
That was a long time ago.
She's been through a lot since then.
So has Jenna.
And when she heard Alison was alive
and coming home, she panicked.
She felt totally alone, so she reached out to me. And--
What exactly did she ask you to do?
I mean, besides taking her to her doctor's appointments?
She just wanted to feel safe, I guess.
Make sure that Alison--
Okay, forget Alison.
You latched on to me, Sydney, giving me gifts,
taking over my weekends with training,
telling me sob-stories about how you had no one
cheering for you in the bleachers.
I didn't expect to like you.
What?
I-- I didn't know you'd be such a decent person.
I guess I was expecting you to be...
This is so messed up.
Oh, it's about to get messier.
I'm taking that coaching position
just so I can be in your face,
watching you as much as I can.
Emily.
I want to see you underwater long enough for you
to feel that twinge of panic
when you need air and you can't get it.
I want you to know
what it feels like to be sucker-punched.
Surprise.
What the hell are you doing here?
Give me the key.
Get out of here now.
I swear, Noel, get the hell out or I'll--
You'll what?
Call the cops?
Sure you want them to see what you're hiding in here?
Get out of here!
Now!
You break into my car,
steal something from me and I'm the bad guy?
Nice.
Give me the key.
Why do you even have that stuff?
And we know that it was you that broke into Hanna's house.
We know that you're helping Alison.
You know nothing.
Give me that key!
What are you two gonna do next?
What are you gonna do with that stuff?
Talk to me!
Alison doesn't even know I have it.
And if you tell her I do--
Wait, are you guys working together or not?
Our friend likes to throw away people
when she's done using them
and I need to be prepared, okay?
They aren't just pictures, Spencer.
It's proof that she was never kidnapped.
You're going to blackmail her.
It's not blackmail.
It's insurance, in case she turns on me.
And I need it back.
Where did you even get it, those pictures, the tape?
Shana sent them to Jenna.
And Alison asked me to borrow them from Jenna's bedroom.
So you broke into that house, too?
When?
Minutes before it blew up.
Alison keeps telling me I'm lucky
I got out when I did, but...
part of me is starting to wonder
if that explosion wasn't a coincidence.
What does she have on you, Noel?
Why would you do this for her?
Enough questions.
Just give me the key, Spencer.
No.
Give it to me!
No!
You stupid bitch!
You try that again and I swear to God,
I will slit your face open.
That stuff is mine.
You're not the only one who needs insurance, Noel.
We need it, too. Okay?
And I promise you,
I will keep it in a much safer place than this.
Okay?
Now go.
Go!
I heard that I could find you here.
Can I come in?
It's-- it's nice.
Could use a housekeeper.
Aren't you supposed to be giving a toast right now?
What happened?
Nothing that hasn't happened before.
Apparently, he's a big jerk internationally.
Look, I'm not trying to defend the guy,
but just so you know, "A" stoked the fire.
It doesn't matter, Hanna.
He took the bait.
Why didn't you believe me?
It wasn't-- It wasn't so much that I didn't believe you.
I guess I just wanted to believe something else more.
That my mom could actually find someone again...
be happy.
I get that.
Will you forgive me?
So what do you think really happened?
I don't know.
I mean, don't you think it's weird
that Aria's mom would just get food poisoning
right as everyone is showing up?
Weddings are tricky.
They churn up a lot of stuff.
Especially the second time around.
There may be more to the story.
Totally.
Someone's not telling the truth.
You like kale?
I'll eat anything as long as it's not from the Brew.
Oh, that's probably Hanna.
Hello?
Yes, Lieutenant Tanner, she's here with me.
Why?
Well, no, I...
Her father doesn't get back until early tomorrow.
What's going on?
But I can bring her.
No, I understand.
We'll be right down.
Thank you.
What's going on, Mrs. Marin?
What's wrong?
The police, they caught him.
Caught who?
The person who broke in here last night.
They're questioning him
and they think he's ready to talk.
They want you to go down to the precinct
and answer some questions.
You won't have to do this alone.
I'll be with you.
Sorry, I thought everyone would be at the party by now.
Do you need me to...
No, no, come in. It's your house.
You were nice enough to let us use it while you were gone.
How was the conference?
It was fine.
Why aren't you at the party?
It was canceled.
'Cause, you know, it seems kind of silly
to have an engagement party
when you're no longer engaged.
Do you want to talk about it?
Not really.
But Aria can fill you in on everything,
hopefully, after I've checked into a motel.
I don't know why I took all this out
because I'm never going to get it back in.
You'll do it.
You were always really good at that...
figuring out how to make a small space work.
You know, sometimes I still think about
our first place together.
Remember that dump on East 6th?
What was the ad?
What did they call it?
It wasn't a studio.
It was something smaller.
A "Bachelor."
Yes.
Of course.
As if that explained why the bathtub was in the kitchen.
Well, I guess they assumed that bachelors don't bathe,
which is why they're still bachelors.
I felt so bad that I couldn't get us something better.
You were already pregnant with Aria
and yet, you figured out a way to make it seem big.
The skinny lamp that fit in the sliver of space
between the window and the radiator.
Hiding the fact that you could get yourself a soda
while washing your hair.
It was all about a well-placed drape.
Ella, I don't really know this guy,
but whoever doesn't realize
that you make this small world seem so much bigger,
that person doesn't deserve you.
Is this your first attempt to see her
after she ran away from you?
She didn't run away.
She jumped out of my car.
And you had her blindfolded.
That's right.
At least when I was around her.
Are you referring to the car ride?
No.
Since the day she came away with me.
After I hit her.
Where did you hit her?
Back of the head.
I followed her into the yard
and I found a rock and I hit her.
Then I carried her to my car.
Where did you take her?
Philly.
A place I was staying near South Street.
Your home?
I was crashing there, yeah.
It was a basement.
Nobody else was there.
And you kept her locked up
in the basement all that time?
Can you turn the volume down?
Alison, is that him?
Is that the man who kidnapped you?
The doctor's running just a little behind.
It shouldn't be much longer.
You think you can entertain yourself?
If you're cold, I can turn down the AC.
He followed me into my yard.
And then he hit me with that rock.
Next thing I knew I woke up blindfolded.
