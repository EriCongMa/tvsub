第七季 第四集
Hello, loyal followers.
It's Alexa, back from Oregon.
Got to love the Beaver State.
There's trees galore, awesome hiking.
But I went because of their physician-assisted suicide law.
This brain tumor,
this glioblastoma multiforme--
which sounds like the worst IKEA piece ever--
it, um...
It just keeps getting worse and worse.
So... I just dined on some applesauce du jour
with broken-up pentobarbital mixed in.
My last supper.
Some gallows humor.
I just...
I can't live with the pain anymore.
I don't want to live with only misery to look forward to.
You can see why I want this video excluded from trial, Your Honor.
It is intended to bias the jury.
Bias is exactly what I'm trying to avoid, Your Honor.
The fully-abled have a bias of-of the blessed.
They can't fathom what it would be like to have
to make a decision like the one Alexa Banner had to make.
And yet, sad as Ms. Banner's story is,
this video has no relevance...
Sorry, Your Honor.
It-it, uh... it is merely an attempt...
...to... ah.
Here, I...Look, I can give...
Oh, thank you.
Yes.
Uh, the bottom line is that what Doctors Pogue
and, uh, Brinton did is illegal.
Hence, this wrongful death suit.
State law is very clear.
Physician...
Your Honor.
Uh, physician-assisted...
suicide.
It's...
I, uh...
You were talking about state law,
which you seem to believe is very clear.
Thank you.
Who's winning?
Um, my clients can speak to Alexa's...
Excuse me?
Between the two, who's winning?
Uh, I have no idea.
I think you do.
Do I know you?
Your Honor...
I don't even think
Canning needs those canes.
I think they're props.
Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I-I have to focus on this.
I know.
I'm Mr. Dipple's general counsel.
Ethan Carver.
Are you checking up on me?
No. Him.
The bottom line is that this wrongful-death suit...
That's why he's fired,
and you're replacing him.
Mr. Dipple assured me
that I would not have to argue in court.
What does "AWTTW" mean in a text?
My role was to prep Mr. Oakman and help him anticipate
what the defense would argue, that's all.
"A word to the wise."
Thank you. God, I hate texts.
It's the ugliest language on the planet.
Mr. Carver, I am not arguing in court.
You are, Ms. Lockhart.
You've been prepping this case for the last six months.
But not to argue in court.
This is an anti-euthanasia case.
No, it's a pro-parent case.
The parents of a girl who committed suicide...
But Mr. Dipple wants to use this in order to beat back advances
in physician-assisted suicide, right?
I can't support that. I am pro-euthanasia.
Ms. Lockhart, I hate being the bully here.
I get very tense.
Mr. Dipple compensates you very well.
If you don't take over this case, we will lose.
There is no one else who knows it as well as you.
As a devil's advocate.
Yes, but
who knows the advocate's case better than the Devil?
All rise! Court is now in session.
Let's get this show on the road.
Gentlemen, good day.
You have been arrested.
It is our task today to figure out whether
you deserve bail and the amount.
Think of it as the sorting hat from Harry Potter.
We're sorting you...
So, where are we?
I lead with 12,560 pounds.
Come on, you do not.
I got the last guy. 320 pounds.
It was on his arrest report.
So, who's second?
We have a tie, Bernie, and...
Good morning.
Hello.
What'd I miss?
We just got back from lunch, and we're tied.
11,300 pounds: Alicia.
11,250 pounds: Bernie. A virtual tie.
I'm sorry. What? And Don
brings up the rear.
It's only 'cause I get anorexic shoplifters.
More sinned against than sinning.
Don at 9,650 pounds
of anorexic shoplifters.
Excuse me.
But what are we talking about here?
"Perps by the Pound."
It's Shoplifting Day.
Everyone with light fingers gets processed today.
And we're tied at 11,300 pounds.
Virtually.
Pounds of what?
Perps. Clients.
You clear enough cases, you can beat Lucca.
Are you guys serious?
Yes, whoever wins
gets first choice of what days to work.
You're competing over who clears the most cases by weight?
We're competing.
Oh, I'm not.
Uh, you're in second place. Yes, you are.
Are we all understanding?
None of you are indigent, which means
you must pay for your own attorney.
The Chicago Bar has provided us with four bar attorneys.
Please stand.
They are available for hire at your convenience.
I want to be clear: you do not need to hire them.
If you do not hire them, you will be pushed
to the back of the line, which means
you will not be sorted until tomorrow.
Are we all understanding?
Bully. Here we go. Ms. Quinn,
you have males 98 through 117.
Mr. Bukovitz, 118 through 135.
Mr. Weingarten, 136 to 151.
And Mrs. Florrick, 152 to 170.
Male number 118.
All right, Matan...
Male number 118.
It's on your hand! Look at your hand!
I've been appointed your bond attorney...
Male 98? Where are you?
Male 98?
Too bad, Lucca.
Male 28, Daniel Rojas, attempted shoplifting.
Good. Good, yeah, keep Lucca from winning. She always wins.
I'm not playing.
Well, that's fine with me.
But what are you gonna do, not clear his case?
Do you speak English?
Male 136.
Male 152-- retail theft in the amount of $45.
What do you got, Mr. Brody?
A repeat offender. Nine months probation.
Mr. Mason pleads guilty, Your Honor.
Good. Time served. Male 98!
Good, wipe that cocky smile off Bernie's face.
I'm not playing. I'm not!
58, Ms. Brantley, liquor store theft?
Uh, ma'am, over here.
I'm innocent. I really am.
Ma'am, this is
your first arrest. The judge'll go easy on you,
you'll get probation, go home today.
But I didn't steal anything.
It was a gift. I brought it back so I could
exchange it for something else.
Look, there's no time for this.
They're saying I was making a false return, like
I stole it so I could get money.
If you want to fight this,
it'll take months of your life and thousands
of dollars to defend yourself.
You want to say I'm guilty, but I can't.
I can't look at my kids and say...
Look, there's no time to discuss this.
The state's attorney might even add charges
if you insist on your innocence.
He can do that?
He can do whatever he wants. He's a real son of a bitch.
I don't care.
I'm not guilty.
Okay.
I'll talk to the prosecutor and see what I can get,
but you have to get yourself into this new frame of mind, ma'am.
You're under arrest.
Sometimes it doesn't make a difference if you did it or not.
You trying to guess my weight?
Excuse me?
I heard your friends laughing.
You-you score points based on your clients' weight, right?
I'm not doing that, ma'am.
Then what are you doing?
He's lying.
The prosecutor can't add charges
just because you won't take a plea.
Yeah.
Hello. Um, Ms. Brantley,
Okay, good news.
Prosecutor's willing to play ball-- probation, one year.
No. You're fired.
I want her.
This is nothing more than a ploy, Your Honor.
This case should be tried in Oregon, Your Honor,
where my clients have their practices.
But Alexa Banner's
suicide took place here in Illinois,
where physician-assisted suicide is still illegal.
Mr. Canning, are you okay?
Yeah, I-I... I will be in a second. I just have to get...
Your Honor, um, Mr. Canning
knows that an Oregon jury
will be more sympathetic to his case.
This court... How many?
I got it.
These doctors knew
that the victim was bringing drugs
to Chicago in order to kill herself.
The trial should take place here.
I'm agreeing with Ms. Lockhart on this one, Mr. Canning.
Diane, why are you doing this?
You're fighting for a cause you fundamentally don't believe in.
Because you make me angry.
Mr. Dipple has been very pleased
with the work you've been doing these last few months.
So, keep it up... but keep the billable hours down.
We're happy to have you here, Mr. Carver.
Is there anything else we can do for you?
I'm sure you're aware the Illinois General Assembly
is considering the Physician- Assisted Suicide Act.
Yes. The Medical Coalition of Illinois
recently dropped their objections.
That's a game-changer.
And like California,
it gives the governor a path to approving it.
I understand you know the governor's wife,
Alicia Florrick.
You want us to talk to her?
Blocking physician-assisted suicide is an issue
Mr. Dipple feels in his gut.
He wants to fight this on every front possible.
Alicia doesn't work here anymore because
Mr. Dipple didn't want her here.
But let us see what we can do.
You're screwing me out of my fee.
You're trying to sabotage me so you can take the day.
You really think I care that much about your little game?
She was about to take the deal
till you stuck your nose in it.
What's going on?
She's trying to screw me out of my $135.
No, your client is...
Alicia, professional courtesy.
We don't undercut each other, we don't snake each other's fees.
The Florricks apparently do.
Need an election, just steal it.
Go to hell, Bernie.
No.
You want her and her 120 pounds so much, fine. Go for it.
130 to 140...
Come on, female 42. Retail theft
in the amount of $899. What's the offer?
One year probation.
Good. Defense?
Uh, Your Honor, unfortunately my client cannot allocute.
Why?
It's a good offer, Judge,
she stole a $899 sweater.
He's right, ma'am.
Your record could be sealed six months after probation.
But I didn't steal anything.
Approach, Counselors.
Sweeten the deal, Matan. Now. It's her first arrest.
I could live with six months. But that's my basement.
There. He did his part.
My client won't take it.
Then do your damn job
and sell it to her.
And don't you dare slow me down, Mrs. Florrick.
I'll recall you in a minute. Female 44,
retail theft of $71.
I can probably get her to take six months
with a reducer to a misdemeanor.
No, I did my caving.
I need a guilty plea.
The prosecution is willing to take it down to six months probation,
but you'll need to plead guilty.
But all I did was return a sweater.
This is...
I'm not admitting to anything.
Maia, listen to me. You won't serve one hour in jail.
But it'll be on my record.
For six months, and then you can have it sealed.
Female 42. Recalled.
So, we, uh, closing this out?
My client pleads not guilty.
Seriously? He offered you six months. Six.
Yes, but she cannot plead...
Up here, Mrs. Florrick.
I'm sorry, Your Honor, I tried.
Give the rest of your defendant sheets
to the sheriff. They're being distributed.
What? Why?
I know you get paid by the case.
Call it quid pro quo for the time
you're costing this court.
Your Honor...
You can sit on that pew with your precious client
until preliminary hearings, for all I care.
Female 65. Retail theft in the amount of $93.
Your Honor, this is unfair.
Ma'am, when did you think bond court was about being fair?
What's going on?
I'm being taxed.
Remember me?
Hope I'm not interrupting.
No, not at all. Eli and I were just
going over the campaign scheduling.
I like your office.
Can't help but think of when we started the firm here.
So... I came to ask if you'd lobby Peter on a bill.
It's called the Physician-Assisted Suicide Act.
It'll hit Peter's desk in a week or so.
And you want me to persuade him to sign it?
No. Veto it.
Really? Why is that?
You wanted to return to the firm.
This could be your ticket back.
I don't understand.
Well, Reese Dipple is the reason you're not at the firm.
You sway Peter on this bill,
and Dipple will sprinkle rose petals
as you step off the elevator.
No.
I'm happy here, Cary.
I like what I'm doing.
It's not a lot of money.
I know.
Anyway, I ask for something from Peter,
he asks for something back.
And I don't want to be asked for anything.
Especially not physician-assisted suicide.
No mother should have to watch
their child go through what Alexa did.
I just wish she could have held on a little longer.
But isn't that selfish?
Why make her hold on if she was in so much pain?
Why not let her go?
If she were terminal,
I could have let her go, but she wasn't.
Objection, Your Honor,
um, the witness is-is not a medical expert.
Um, my clients can speak to Alexa's...
You'd be surprised what kind of expert you can become
when your child gets brain cancer.
Uh, ma'am, please. Let me rule on the objections.
Overruled.
Mrs. Banner, the doctors here at the defense table said that
your daughter was terminal.
They were wrong.
A week before they prescribed those suicide drugs,
Duke University announced a new treatment for glioblastoma tumors.
Let me help you with those, Mr. Canning.
And what was that treatment?
The polio virus.
It's introduced into the tumorous brain cells
so it won't reproduce in the healthy ones.
It destroys the tumor.
And if your daughter had been told
that there was hope in this treatment?
She'd still be here.
Would you like to take a minute, Mrs. Banner?
No.
If I knew about this treatment, why didn't they?
Why did they give her drugs to kill herself
instead of giving her hope?
That's not what doctors are supposed to do.
Mr. Crouse.
Mrs. Florrick.
You could've knocked. My daughter's home.
Didn't want to.
I thought you found another investigator.
I felt rejected.
Well... we were broke.
Ah, so you found a rich client now?
We found a client.
She's willing to pay for three hours of an investigator.
Really? How extravagant. Starting now?
She's telling the truth.
I bought the sweater for my daughter, for her birthday.
And do you have the receipt?
No, I think I threw it away.
Do you know what day you bought it, ma'am?
Sunday before her birthday.
August 16.
Did you pay cash or credit card?
Cash.
Always cash.
I'm guessing that's not good.
It just makes it more difficult
for us to prove that you bought it.
You're not covering for your daughter, are you, Mrs. Sachs?
No. Have you ever shopped at the store? At Salvatori's?
No, ma'am.
I have, a few times. Why?
They don't want me to shop there.
They tend to make it difficult for you.
Not for you, but for us.
Are you saying your daughter was targeted because of her race?
Yes. Actually, I am saying that.
My daughter is no thief.
Okay.
Let me see what I can find out.
So this is your new office?
Yes, Jackie.
It's not as big as it once was.
That's right.
And you're dressing up more?
No, these are my usual clothes.
Are you sure?
I don't remember you showing so much cleavage.
And you had a haircut. It's very different.
Yes.
Many changes. A world in transition.
What is it you need from me, Mr. Gold?
Peter is being pressured to take a stance on a bill
legalizing physician-assisted suicide.
What? What stance?
Against it.
Against physician-assisted suicide?
Yes.
But he doesn't believe that.
That's probably true, but...
the Catholic
and conservative lobbies have his ear.
He'd probably want to hear from you.
A concerned member of the family.
But... only if you have the time.
I could make time.
He has a new campaign manager now.
Ruth Eastman.
She likes to limit access to Peter,
but just you tell her you're his mother,
and I'm sure she'll make an allowance.
Judge, four different times before, they found a client of yours guilty.
Which prevents me from mounting a proper defense.
You know they're playing games.
Objection.
It's a perfectly reasonable request, your Honor.
Requests, plural.
She's asking for both the SKU from the sweater
This is for a lousy...
What is a SKU?
A stock-keeping unit, Your Honor.
It's an electronic identifier attached to every sales item
to keep it from being stolen.
Oh, God.
Get up here, Mrs. Florrick.
No, not you.
This is not To Kill a Mockingbird.
This is not Anatomy of a Murder.
This is a constitutionally mandated necessity.
It is Lucille Ball wrapping chocolates
on an assembly line.
Cases get processed, justice is served for the greater whole.
Not for you, not for her.
For all people.
And I will be damned if I will allow you to gum it up.
Motion denied. Step the hell back.
Then we request a continuance, Your Honor.
Preliminary hearings are for the prosecution.
Are you ready to proceed, Mr. Brody?
100%.
Then call your first witness.
Your Honor, this is wholly unfair.
Damn straight, Marie Antoinette.
Because every other defendant in this room
and in that hallway isn't gonna see their kids tonight,
thanks to you.
Now step back.
You're on, Mr. Brody.
You have glioblastoma multiforme, is that correct?
I had it. Past tense.
So your tumor-- the exact type that Alexa Banner had-- is gone?
Yeah.
Thanks to the Duke polio trial, I am cancer-free.
Elvis has left the building.
And when you were ill, did you contemplate suicide?
Every day for about a year.
I didn't want to go on.
But then you found hope?
Objection, Your Honor. Counsel is testifying.
Withdrawn.
Mr. Linklater,
would you consider yourself a medical miracle?
Objection,
miracles have no basis in fact.
Really? I saw the '69 Mets.
How about a recess, Your Honor?
What are you offering, Mr. Canning?
$1 million, no admission of liability,
and, uh, a gag order.
Okay. I will take that to our client.
Are you willing to drop the gag order?
No, that's-that's non-negotiable.
Then you can expect a no.
Dipple must be paying you one hell of a retainer.
That's a good offer I made you in there.
And our clients will hear it.
This is such a farce.
I mean, you of all people
support physician-assisted suicide, Diane.
When did you go mercenary?
And who's paying your bills, Louis?
You win, more people kill themselves,
and the insurance companies save billions on hospital expenses.
Yeah, sure, I'm an insurance company shill.
But they happen to be on the right side of this issue.
I'm not gonna take lessons in hypocrisy from you.
Carver and Dipple don't care about your clients.
They just want to raise malpractice rates.
Intimidate doctors out of helping people die.
Talk to your clients.
See how much they really care about gag orders.
Mr. Gold, hi.
Oh, my mom's not here.
That's okay,
I just came to drop something off for her.
This week's invitations.
Women's group meetings all over Iowa,
bar functions.
Any command performances?
They're tabbed red, yellow, and green.
Oh. Thanks.
Actually, Grace, do you have a minute?
Sure, what's up?
What do you think about physician-assisted suicide?
Why?
You're still...
Christian, right?
Yeah, I'm still Christian.
Well, I think your dad might need some advice
from someone who is against physician-assisted suicide.
Edward Waller.
I'm a security officer at Salvatori's Department Store.
And before that, you served as a specialist in the U.S. Army,
training soldiers in Iraq?
Objection. Relevance.
Oh, dear God. Are you serious?
Overruled.
Overruled. Continue.
I worked at Al Asad Air Base,
Anbar Province for two years.
Mr. Waller, this is the report
you filed on the theft by Maia Sachs.
Does this accurately describe
the events of this past Tuesday?
Sure does. We see this ruse every day.
Customer walks in
with an empty Salvatori bag.
They rip the tags off some item,
drop the item in the bag,
and pretend to return it for cash.
Thank you.
Mr. Waller...
We're done here, Mrs. Florrick.
I... Excuse me?
We're done here. You can cross tomorrow.
Factory whistle's blown.
Your Honor, my-my cross will only take a few minutes.
Mrs. Sachs, you'll be spending the night
in the Cook County Jail unless you choose to plead...
Your Honor, this is... this is blackmail.
Plead or jail, Mrs. Sachs?
I'm not pleading.
Fine.
Henry, would you please escort
Mrs. Sachs to the Cook County Jail?
Hang in there, Maia. It'll be okay.
And if it's not okay, Mrs. Sachs,
you can blame your attorney.
Alicia, it's Jason.
You ever argue a case against racial profiling?
I'm optimistic.
Wind's blowing our way.
Is this a Trojan horse?
Reese, may I call you back?
Trojan horse?
To raise malpractice insurance.
To make sure no doctor ever helps a dying patient
end his or her life?
Yes, of course. That's a secondary purpose.
So this is the first of many suits?
Doctors are rarely moved by ethical arguments against euthanasia.
But they do understand money.
Rising malpractice rates tend to sharpen the mind.
Do you know any terminally ill people, Mr. Carver?
I mean gravely ill and in constant pain?
Yes.
And you don't think that person
has the right to end his or her life?
I don't think doctors should be in the business of killing,
if that's what you're asking.
I know it's a strange concept.
But I don't like when categories get confused.
When a fireman starts fires
instead of putting them out.
Fahrenheit 451.
I thought you'd appreciate that.
So you're fine with civilian volunteers
helping people die instead of doctors?
No. But at least it would take
the veneer of medicine away from it.
I don't understand you people.
We people?
You want to get government off our backs
until it comes to issues like abortion and euthanasia.
A perfectly healthy woman was allowed to kill herself
at an assisted dying clinic in Basel.
She wasn't terminal, she wasn't sick.
Her only rationale was...
she was afraid of getting old.
And losing control.
Doctors killed
1,807 people last year in Belgium.
Some only suffering from depression.
Yes, and if this were Belgium, we would have something to argue
Dominoes fall fast in this country.
Just ask gay couples getting married in Alabama.
Ouch. Ouch, my head is hurting from the wrongness here.
You ask anyone
who survives a jump from the Golden Gate Bridge
what their last thought is...
You've done a lot of that, have you?
It's always this: what a stupid mistake I just made.
And that's why you would take away their choice?
I don't think this country should make it easier for people to die.
Not even the terminally ill?
We should make it easier to manage pain. That should be the goal.
Why not both?
Do you want off this case?
No.
But I want it to be about this case
and not every case.
Okay.
Raptor is on-site.
It's Mrs. Florrick.
Copy that. I've got eyes on Raptor.
Hello, Mrs. Florrick.
Mrs. Florrick, hello.
I don't think we've met. I'm Ruth Eastman,
your son's campaign manager.
Oh, I love that purse. It's very attractive.
Thank you. I need to speak to my son.
Oh, he's in a meeting right now. Why don't we talk for a minute?
I was just pouring some tea.
I'd love to. And maybe after I speak to my son.
Actually, I'm afraid it's our standing staff meeting.
Every Tuesday, come hell or high water.
Peter?
Unfortunately, that won't work.
Our aides are instructed:
no interruptions, no exceptions.
Just give 'em 20 minutes. Come on.
Why don't we get better acquainted in here?
Oh, excuse me. Um...
excuse me. Let me answer this, and we'll talk.
It'll just be a minute.
Hello.
Yes, I prescribed ten grams of pentobarbital liquid to Alexa.
And what steps did you take before prescribing it?
I examined Alexa and determined she had a terminal illness
that would likely cause death within six months.
And, of course, I talked to her.
About what?
Whether this was voluntary.
Whether it was what she wanted. If she was depressed.
Sounds thorough.
I try to be.
The law requires we discuss every danger
and issue before we prescribe.
But more than that, I thought it was my responsibility.
Thank you.
Dr. Brinton, the law also says
that patients need to be advised of their alternatives.
Did you tell Alexa about the Duke study?
That's not what the law means. It means like hospice care.
So you didn't tell her about the Duke study?
No.
But you knew about it?
I knew it was in its early stages, but the odds
of success were very low. At best, one in 20.
I didn't want to give her false hope.
False hope?
Yes.
Patients look for any scrap of good news from a doctor.
But there was good news, wasn't there?
Not in my opinion.
Don't you think the person
who should have been making that ultimate call
was Alexa and not you?
Objection.
Badgering.
Pointed, yes. Badgering, no. Overruled.
She did make the ultimate call.
Yes, but not with all of the information.
It wouldn't have made a difference.
You don't know that.
I looked at the arrest records out of the department store.
It's almost all African-Americans.
There's a racist security guard?
Or a spotter.
What's a spotter?
It's an undercover shopper
who keeps an eye out for shoplifters.
It's also possible the spotters
are targeting African-Americans just to...
keep 'em away. It's like the New York stores last year.
Couple of 'em settled
an attorney general's investigation...
What?
That's her.
That's one of the ones they targeted.
The goal is to get you out of here.
So your best move is to plea and pay your fine.
But I didn't steal anything.
Ms. Todd...
Betty, you'll make your life a lot easier if you do what I say.
Let me talk to the prosecutor, plead it out.
Don't plead her out.
What?
Why?
Female 62.
I-I need 30 seconds with Matan on this one, Your Honor.
You get 20.
Salvatori's, the department store,
it's targeting African-Americans.
She didn't do it.
Uh-uh, Alicia. This isn't your case.
Back the hell off.
But I have a witness who can testify.
I don't care. You're slowing things down.
Can I change attorneys?
Mom. I didn't know you were coming in.
I didn't realize I needed an appointment.
Of course you don't. No, please, sit, sit.
I'd rather stand, Peter. It's hard enough to...
Uh, I came here
intending to discuss an issue of real importance to me,
but now, uh...
Well, your campaign manager,
Ms. Eastman, is not serving you well.
And she's disrespecting me.
Now, whether you were state's attorney or governor,
I still always had access to you.
But now, with this presidential run...
Nothing's changed, Mom.
...suddenly there's a palace guard
wearing a pantsuit and cheap shoes,
and she showed no remorse...
Mom, I think maybe...
No, Peter,
listen to me.
She needs to get her priorities straight,
or you need to dismiss her.
Okay, I will talk to Ruth.
Do you want to now discuss this issue of importance with me?
No, I... I can't. Not in this state.
We'll have to talk about it another time.
Okay.
Just so you know, I have to go back to Iowa...
Oh, Mrs. Florrick, hi again...
I just wanted to let you know that your daughter stopped by,
wanting to talk to you about the physician-assisted suicide bill.
But I handled it.
You what?
What do you mean you handled it?
First, you come between a mother and her son,
and now you feel comfortable coming
between a son and his daughter?
Oh, no, no, no. That's not what I mean.
Is that why your wife wanted to end her life,
because of the pain?
Yes.
She was afraid she was losing control over her life.
Ms. Lockhart has spoken a lot about
this Duke brain tumor study.
Would that have changed Alexa's mind
if she knew about it?
Objection.
Calls for speculation.
Goes to state of mind, Your Honor.
Overruled.
Alexa was beyond hope.
She said she wanted to go out on her own terms.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming today.
And, Mr. Crouse, can you please describe what you witnessed?
Ms. Todd being followed by a spotter
and arrested, despite the fact she didn't steal anything.
Thank you.
Mr. Crouse, were you disbarred as a lawyer six years ago?
I was.
Because you punched a judge
after he found a client of yours guilty.
Objection. Relevance.
Overruled. Let's keep this moving.
Yes.
And were you not investigated by the bar
four different times before then for altering evidence,
Objection!
all in an effort to prove
your clients were innocent?
This is beyond the pale.
It's character assassination 101.
I don't care.
Overruled.
Why should we believe
your account of what happened to Ms. Todd?
Objection.
Mr. Crouse's background has no bearing
on what he witnessed.
And yet in my mind, it does.
Why should you believe my account?
Because I'm telling the truth.
Of course you are.
No, no, I'm your lawyer.
You can't change lawyers now.
I don't want you. I want that lady.
Yeah. You should be doing what she is.
Look, I don't care what Mrs. Florrick is doing.
The best way to get out is to plead.
Sure. If that's what you want.
Congratulations.
You've just stolen another client.
No, I didn't... I wasn't...
Grace, if you believe in the sanctity of life...
It's not a choice, Grandma.
That's what the Bible commands.
I went to Sunday school, dear.
All right, I think what Grandma's trying to say,
Grace, is that, when it come to euthanasia,
there is possibly a broader imperative.
I can speak for myself, thank you.
Grace, all religions preach respect
for every human being.
Which means respecting their choices,
including those about end of life.
But if there's a higher authority...
Then he wouldn't want someone with end-stage ovarian cancer
to go on suffering.
Governor, your wife is on the line.
Grace, on this issue I understand that...
Alicia, hi.
Veronica. Hello.
They told me that...
No, but then, all of a sudden,
if we start-- if that's something that we have to decide...
Uh, well, I appreciate it, but I already have
all the research on the physician-assisted suicide bill.
We're talking about the doctors.
Oh, well, I have to go, Veronica,
but I will tell Alicia that we talked. Thanks.
What the hell's going on today?
When one family member shows up, it's a surprise.
When two do, it's a coincidence.
When three show up, it's Eli.
He's messing with me, Governor.
I don't care.
Do you hear me? I don't give a damn.
Your little skirmishes are not my problem.
I am running for the most powerful office in the world.
I need you to fix this, and I need you to fix this right now.
It's never been our choice.
One of our people found it.
They must have dug pretty deep for this.
Anything to help the cause, Ms. Lockhart.
Who is Karen Casavant?
Mr. Stoke?
She's my friend.
Your girlfriend?
Objection.
Relevance.
Goes to bias, Your Honor.
Overruled.
When did you start seeing
Ms. Casavant, sir?
Seven months ago.
So a month before Alexa committed suicide?
Sorry to scare you, honey.
No, it's fine. Just...
there are actually over 60 different Bible verses
that make it clear how precious life is.
Genesis 2:7. Acts 17:25.
Lutheran Church of Hope, born and raised.
I know where you're coming from.
My nephew Andrew just joined
the Marines right out of high school.
He could have been going to an Ivy League college.
Instead, he'll be doing push-ups in the mud on Paris Island.
But it's what he needs right now.
An ordering principle for his life.
Something to believe in.
I... I-I don't understand.
Your granddaughter Grace.
If they're not idealistic at that age,
when can they be?
You're always gonna have your dad's ear, Grace.
And I promise you, you're always going to have mine, too.
We need you on this campaign.
You're always going to have your boy's ear, Mrs. Florrick.
And I promise you you're always gonna have mine, too.
I'm realizing we need you on this campaign.
Yes. Thank you.
And I'll tell you something for nothing.
The smartest men listen to their women.
And the smartest women...
are those with more than a little experience.
Am I right?
This is a list of the clients I'm representing,
all of whom were arrested for theft at your store.
You'll notice that a disproportionate number are African-Americans.
This is the kind of thing the Sun-Times eats up,
especially when there's rumblings of a class action.
On the other hand, if I could see some security tape...
The only thing more boring than watching security footage is nothing.
It's the best viewing in the world.
This gives you real insight into human character.
So you beat up a judge?
I hit a judge.
I wanted to beat up a judge,
but I got tackled after the first punch.
Hmm. Anger issues, maybe?
I am the calmest, sweetest man
on the face of the earth.
But there are times...
and there are people
that sometimes just don't listen to reason.
Do I need to worry about you?
Yeah.
Seriously, now.
Why do you think you got me so cheap?
There's your client.
Where is she going, the register?
Hard to tell from here.
Let's try a different angle.
2015年9月12日 下午4点
Well, that's unfortunate-- we can't see what she's doing.
Wha-What are you doing?
2015年8月16日
The day the mom bought the sweater.
2015年8月16日 下午两点
Smart.
That's her.
Not what I expected.
I don't believe this.
The only way to get you off
is to show this video to the judge.
And she gets hauled into court?
And that judge calls her number in front of all those people.
Yes.
I'll take the plea.
What's next?
Just closing statements and crossing of fingers.
I trust in good arguments,
not magical happenings.
What?
Why is he back here?
Did your wife have an account
on the Web site Scabbit?
Yes.
Can you see that okay?
Let's look at this posting she made May 12.
Can you read that?
"Garbage."
"Garbage" With an exclamation point.
Now let's just scroll up and see
what thread she was responding to.
为小儿麻痹治疗提供希望
Now, you see that? Can you read that?
"Duke University Brain Tumor Center
offers hope for polio cure"
So Alexa did know
about the potential treatment and still made the decision
that the slim chance of success wasn't worth it.
Ruth. Come in.
Oh. I don't want to interrupt you, Eli.
I just wanted to say thank you.
I know you were trying to make my life hell
by siccing all those Florricks on me. But you know what?
We worked through it.
And it wound up bringing me a lot closer to Jackie and Grace.
So thank you.
And just remember...
I'm good at what I do.
You want to get me,
you'll have to bring your "A" Game.
Open or closed?
Or I guess it doesn't matter.
It's really not as bad as you think.
You came in second in perps by the pound.
All the bar attorneys think I'm a slimy bitch
who poached their clients.
Who cares about them?
I also gave up a possible class action suit
for some video footage I couldn't use.
The way I see it, you have two problems.
One-- you spend too much time on your cases.
Which is why you'll always be a disaster in bond court.
And two...
Nope.
One problem.
What were you gonna say?
No. You'll wear it as a badge of honor.
Oh, come on. Now you have to say.
You care too much.
There.
How's that? Happy?
Not really.
There's no glory in this slog, Alicia.
Shake the trees for better-paying cases.
What?
Want to do it together?
