chandler , mon , there &apos;s only one banana @-@ nut muffin left .
i ordered mine first .
yeah , but i &apos;m so much faster .
give it to me .
no .
give it to me !
okay , you can have it .
there you go . enjoy your coffee .
that was there when i got here .
hey , you &apos;ll never guess who &apos;s coming to new york .
quick , tell us before he swallows .
ryan , that guy i dated who &apos;s in the navy .
you went out with a guy in the navy ?
i met him while playing guitar in the park .
ryan threw in saltwater taffy because he didn &apos;t have change .
is that when you wrote &quot; saltwater taffy man &quot; ?
no , he &apos;s my submarine guy . he resurfaces every couple years ...
... and we have an amazing three days together .
only this time , he &apos;s coming for 2 weeks . two whole weeks , which means &quot; yea &quot; !
so this guy goes down for , like , two years at a time ?
that &apos;ll teach you to lick my muffin .
hi .
oh , no . what happened ?
i just spoke to carol . ben &apos;s got chickenpox .
oh , no .
yeah , so if you haven &apos;t had it , chances are you &apos;ll get it .
i &apos;ve had it .
i &apos;ve had it .
had it .
had it .
i &apos;ve never had it . i feel so left out . oh , look !
the one with the chicken pox
honey , you made the bed again .
i told you , you don &apos;t have to do that . this isn &apos;t camp .
then i guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for .
i &apos;m taking a shower . today i &apos;ll sing jim croce &apos;s &quot; leroy brown . &quot;
hey , mon , i have a question .
is leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town ...
... or the fattest man ?
the baddest . otherwise , the song would be &quot; fat , fat leroy brown . &quot;
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m just waiting for you , sweetie .
are you remaking the bed ?
i &apos;m sorry . the way you did it , it was just fine .
then you &apos;re redoing it because ... ?
you &apos;ll think i &apos;m crazy .
you &apos;re pretty much running that risk either way .
okay . you see ...
... the duvet tag shouldn &apos;t be at the top left corner ...
... it should be at the bottom right corner .
that &apos;s not so crazy .
i &apos;m just easing you in .
all right .
you see these little flower blossoms ?
they should be facing up not down ...
... because the head of the bed is where the sun would be .
you don &apos;t love me anymore , do you ?
actually , if it &apos;s possible , i love you more .
really ?
wow . well , then , come on !
i wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point .
if you need something to hold you over ...
... i can get you a job here as an entry @-@ level processor .
don &apos;t you need experience ?
it &apos;s not hard to learn .
as for people realizing you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing , you &apos;re an actor .
act like a processor , people will think you &apos;re a processor .
here &apos;s this morning &apos;s projections .
thanks . scott alexander , joey tribbiani .
joey is a fellow processor .
no kidding ?
i process . people want the processing , i &apos;m the one they call .
where do you work ?
well , i &apos;m in between things .
you know , one day you &apos;re processing , the next day ...
... you &apos;re not so much processing anymore .
i told joey about the opening in fleischman &apos;s group .
fleischman &apos;s group .
whatever you do , don &apos;t touch his sandwiches .
are all you processors dorks ?
this lipstick looks just great on you .
you look fabulous . you really do .
yeah , are you sure ? really ?
see , you look beautiful . for god sakes , dim the lights .
i &apos;m hideous !
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
ryan &apos;s been underwater .
he &apos;s just gonna be glad you don &apos;t have barnacles on your butt .
come in .
hey , baby , i &apos;m back
hey , ryan . what &apos;s up ?
what &apos;s going on ?
no , no . you have to stay back .
i have the pox !
chicken or small ?
chicken , which is so ironic considering i &apos;m a vegetarian .
why aren &apos;t you home in bed ?
my grandmother &apos;s never had chickenpox .
please tell me you have , because oh , my god , i forgot how cute you are .
i &apos;m sorry , i never had them .
if i had one wish , i &apos;d go back to when i was 7 ...
... when jimmy hauser had chickenpox , and rub that kid all over my face .
yeah , or you could wish that i didn &apos;t have them now .
can i see your face ?
no . you don &apos;t wanna see a face covered with pox .
it could be lox , i wouldn &apos;t care .
and you hate fish .
so sweet . all right .
okay , all right . you can see .
this is me .
sorry !
i am scary !
the lightening was an unfortunate coincidence .
you look lovely ! lovely !
i hate this .
i had the most amazing two weeks planned for us .
and everything i had in mind , we had to be a lot closer than this .
i &apos;ve spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men ...
... thinking about this moment .
i am not gonna let a bunch ...
... of itchy spots stand between us .
okay . this is the most romantic disease i &apos;ve ever had .
how &apos;s the first day ?
good . it &apos;s like you said .
it &apos;s putting numbers from one column into another .
there you go .
and everybody &apos;s nice . i just had a good talk with that lady jeannie .
jeannie ? the head of east coast operations , jeannie ?
turns out our kids go to the same school .
yeah . small world , huh ?
weird world .
your kids ?
i figure my character has kids .
there isn &apos;t a part of that sentence i don &apos;t need explained .
when you &apos;re acting , you need to think about that stuff .
my character , joseph the processing guy ...
... has two little girls , ashley and brittany .
ashley copies everything brittany does .
well , invisible kids can be that way sometimes .
you know , joseph and his wife , karen , are thinking of having a third kid .
you know what ?
just did .
that &apos;s some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there .
iknow what makes the itching worse ?
that you don &apos;t stop talking about it ?
fine .
let &apos;s just play , okay ?
good , okay .
here we go , double sixes .
here we go ....
here we go ....
come to mama . getting ready to roll the dice ....
what are you doing ? are you scratching ?
no . this is what i do for luck , okay ?
you &apos;re scratching .
give me the dice .
give me the dice .
no ! here . there !
look , double sixes !
we can &apos;t scratch . we &apos;ll scar .
i can &apos;t stop thinking about it . it &apos;s just so hard .
i wanna grab these houses and rub them all over my body .
no !
give it !
come on !
you know you want it . you know you want it too .
let &apos;s just be bad . it &apos;ll feel so good .
come on .
oh , god , help me .
oh , yeah .
okay , good . now do me .
do my back . oh , come on . harder !
there you go .
don &apos;t move .
why ?
don &apos;t move .
what are you ... ?
stop that . stop that right now .
i might &apos;ve expected this of phoebe . but , ryan , you &apos;re a military man .
she made me do it .
that &apos;s a nice color on you .
yeah , well , it comes in pink and blotchy , baby .
i hope you get a weenie pock .
you and milton have to join us on the boat . bring the kids .
we &apos;ll make a day of it .
that sounds lovely . we &apos;ll have to set it up .
i better get back . hope the baby feels better .
thanks .
bye @-@ bye , jeannie .
bye @-@ bye , joseph .
what a phony .
you &apos;ll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing .
hey , mr. douglas . -sir .
bing , i got your memo . we &apos;re not gonna see the report until next friday ?
my group wants to spend the holiday with family .
i have a family . i &apos;m gonna be here .
yeah , bing . what &apos;s that about ?
it &apos;s about cutting them a little slack for morale .
look , i can get some rough numbers by wednesday .
rough numbers ?
this company wasn &apos;t built on rough numbers . right , mr. douglas ?
have the final numbers on my desk by tuesday .
if you say so , sir .
joseph &apos;s good , isn &apos;t he ?
i &apos;m going to kill you .
hey , i just figured joseph &apos;s the kind of guy who likes to mix it up .
you know , get in there , ruffle some feathers .
why ?
look , i &apos;m sorry , but that &apos;s what joseph does .
okay ? if you try to pull something ...
... he &apos;ll call you on it .
&quot; what are you trying to pull ? &quot; he &apos;ll say .
duct tape .
was i supposed to bring something too ?
this is for the scratchy twins . i taped oven mitts to their hands .
you &apos;re strict .
well , it &apos;s for their own good .
you know , i like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under .
see , in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time .
exactly !
god , i love that i can be totally neurotic around you now .
tell me the truth .
don &apos;t you like having everything on your desk perpendicular ?
if it &apos;s not a right angle , it is a wrong angle .
very good .
thank you .
tomorrow , i &apos;m gonna do your clocks .
you &apos;re gonna do what to my clocks ?
set them to my time .
i &apos;m confused .
i thought we shared time .
no . see , in my bedroom i set my clock six minutes fast .
wanna know why ?
because it &apos;s in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen ?
forget it .
no , come on , tell me .
you don &apos;t understand .
come on .
you don &apos;t have any obsessive things .
no , that &apos;s not true .
oh , yeah ? tell me one of yours .
one of my things is i always separate my sweat socks ...
... from my dress socks .
what if they get mixed up ?
boy , i would just ....
i would freak out .
you would not .
i can &apos;t believe this . i hate this . you &apos;re too normal .
i can &apos;t believe you don &apos;t have a &quot; thing . &quot;
my boyfriend doesn &apos;t have a &quot; thing . &quot;
see , if anyone overheard that , i didn &apos;t come off well .
mr. douglas is looking for you .
why is mr. douglas looking for me ?
he suspects you dropped the ball on the lender project .
why ? why does he suspect that ?
at first , he thought it was joseph ...
... but after he asked joseph about it , turns out it was you .
anyway , i thought you should know .
all right . that &apos;s it .
look , joey ...
... i realize this is the role of a lifetime for you ...
... and if i could just fire joseph , i would . but that &apos;s not possible .
so i have to let you both go .
what ? everybody loves joseph .
i don &apos;t . i hate joseph .
i think he &apos;s a brown @-@ nosing suck @-@ up .
you can &apos;t fire joseph . he &apos;s not in your department .
all right , okay . so i can &apos;t fire joseph ...
... but i can sleep with his wife .
not karen !
yeah , i &apos;m thinking about having an affair with her .
you know what ?
i just did .
what the hell are you doing ?
oh , it &apos;s not me .
it &apos;s my character !
chandie .
the rogue processor who seduces his coworkers &apos; wives ...
... and then laughs about it .
in fact , i have her panties right there in my drawer !
really ?
no , freak show , she &apos;s fictional !
take it easy .
if it means that much to you , i &apos;ll go find something else .
thank you .
it &apos;s just that i &apos;m gonna miss joseph .
i liked him . his wife .
she was hot .
and the kids . you know he was gonna put in a pool next summer .
please take these off . i swear i won &apos;t scratch .
no , sorry , hon . monica &apos;s orders .
well , that wasn &apos;t easy .
okay , dinner &apos;s on .
there &apos;s a peach cobbler warming in the oven .
so the plate &apos;s gonna be hot , but that shouldn &apos;t be a problem for you .
all right , you kids . bye , now .

i thought of a thing .
yeah ?
i have to sleep , have to , on this side of the bed .
no . you have to sleep on this side of the bed ...
... because i have to sleep on this side of the bed .
or so i would have you believe .
so you have a side of the bed . everybody has a side of the bed .
hey , come on . you haven &apos;t heard my reason yet .
all right , go on .
i have to sleep on the west side ...
... because i grew up in california ...
... and otherwise ...
... the ocean would be on the wrong side .
oh , my god .

where &apos;re you shipping off to ?
i really can &apos;t say .
do you have nuclear weapons onboard ?
i can &apos;t say .
