honey , would you buy a closet called --
i am waiting to see if i get to go tomorrow .
jury duty . you know , you can just throw that away .
there &apos;s no way they can ever tell you got it .
jay , you &apos;re a bad american .
it is a privilege to serve on a jury .
for the first time , i get to be part of it .
talk to me when you &apos;re eating
a tuna sandwich out of a machine .
anyway , it &apos;s a distressed @-@ oak model that i like to call --
wait , wait ! wait !
i &apos;m in !
8 : 00 a.m. tomorrow . parking structure &quot; c &quot; !
you &apos;re excited about a parking structure ?
it &apos;s not even &quot; a &quot; or &quot; b. &quot;
you &apos;re gonna have to take my place working at joe &apos;s school .
i can &apos;t do that . i have a job .
have claire cover for you .
she knows how to yell at people and read the newspaper .
what the hell &apos;s wrong with that school ?
aren &apos;t we paying them so we don &apos;t have to take care of our kid ?
that &apos;s not the way it works at the learning barn .
you know that they want the parents to be involved
so that they can bond with the kids .
what &apos;s wrong with schools today ?
i &apos;m successful ,
and i had a nun with a mustache .
well , you better get used to going there ,
because if i get put into a murder trial ,
i could be gone for weeks .
maybe i should tell them
that i have experience on a firing squad .
why do you say crazy stuff like that ?
now , that isn &apos;t true , is it ?
wait a second .
that new closet , what did i say it was called ?
you never said .
damn it !
that &apos;s why i need a grease pencil in the shower .
oh , i don &apos;t know , haley .
i mean , he is really cute and really smart and really funny ,
but , oh , he &apos;s always wearing clogs .
no , no .
if he is not a chef , a nurse , or a tulip salesman ,
you need to run .
if your mother had that attitude about a man in clogs ,
you two wouldn &apos;t have a dad .
okay , thanks , dad . i won &apos;t let you down .
bye .
guess what , guys .
i am going to be the big boss at work tomorrow ,
and coincidentally , it &apos;s take your daughter to work day .
i &apos;ll go to work with you , mom .
stop trying to get out of community service .
you need those hours to graduate .
and you &apos;re not a daughter .
mom , dad , sit down .
there &apos;s something i need to talk to you about .
you &apos;re going .
so , girls , what do you say ?
you know we &apos;re not 8 , and i have a job .
you called in sick twice last week because you had a zit .
i work in fashion . they told me not to come in .
alex , honey ,
your last class tomorrow is at 10 : 00 a.m. ,
no , no , no , no !
so , if you hit the road
haley , quick , close the laptop !
until now , i was always a full @-@ time mom ,
so the girls never had a chance to see the other side of me --
you know , powerful woman in charge .
yeah , &apos; cause we never get to see your tough side .
come on , daddy , we &apos;re gonna be late for your work .
i know . i &apos;m excited , too .
okay , i was wrong .
the whistles aren &apos;t better outside .
are you sure you can get all these groceries home by yourself ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m kind of scared .
i &apos;ve never driven groceries home before .
hey , you guys .
ray-- raymond ?
hi . oh , it &apos;s been so long .
yeah . haven &apos;t seen you since , you know .
yeah .
raymond and j &apos;marcus broke up three months ago ,
and they &apos;d been together almost as long as we have .
j &apos;marcus got all the friends ,
and raymond got all the confidence to go shopping in his pajamas .
you guys having a party ?
no , no . party ?
no , not a party .
olive medley , square napkins , cracker trio .
well , these things are just more for a --
what would you say ?
kind of like a get @-@ together ?
get @-@ together , get @-@ together . it &apos;s a last @-@ minute thing .
it &apos;s no big deal .
sounds fun .
no , it &apos;s not gonna be fun .
no . it &apos;s crackers .
it &apos;s supposed to rain .
i &apos;ll see you guys .
yes .
you , too , raymond .
bye @-@ bye .
take care of yourself .
that was close .
i thought we were gonna have to invite him .
raymond , you should come tonight .
really ?
it wouldn &apos;t be a get @-@ together without raymond .
right , cam ?
absolutely .
yeah . oh , you know what ? but ...
i should tell you , j &apos;marcus is gonna be there .
so , if that &apos;s gonna be uncomfortable ,
we totally understand .
no , it &apos;s fine . i &apos;ll be there .
it &apos;ll be nice to see j &apos;marcus again .
maybe he &apos;ll bring one of those shirtless ab sluts
i &apos;ve seen on his facebook page .
i &apos;ll see you guys .
yeah . yeah , see ya .
okay . look forward to it .
you , too .
yeah .
what was i supposed to do ?
i mean , he was all sad and pathetic and broken .
well , yes , the perfect addition to any party .
they are gonna be at each other &apos;s throats
and ruin the whole night . come on , lily .
thanks to you , we are throwing
the antisocial event of the season .
cam .
no , i &apos;m late and i &apos;d like to leave on that .
hi . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m here .
well , this is a special treat .
i spy with my little eye a first @-@ time volunteer !
gloria had jury duty ,
so no chance i could get out of this
by pretending to be racist ?
anyway , uh ... what do you need ?
you can set up the paints , make the kale smoothies ,
and wipe down the rabbit hutch .
on it . margaret ?
paint , smoothies , hutch .
got it .
excuse me . who &apos;s this ?
that &apos;s margaret , my assistant .
i couldn &apos;t have children .
this is not how it works with parent volunteers .
you &apos;re already playing fast and loose
with that term &quot; volunteer , &quot; so ... what do you say ?
as much as we don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; no &quot; --
and , by the way , if any of these little tykes start acting up ,
she &apos;s not afraid to get out the wooden spoon .
jay , i know it &apos;s a little scary ,
but you &apos;re going to have to let her go .
i don &apos;t want her to go .
margaret , just go . i &apos;ll distract him .
come back .
margaret , don &apos;t turn around .
okay , men .
gather &apos; round .
teachable moment .
don &apos;t think of community service as a requirement .
think of cleaning up this park as an opportunity .
to get hepatitis ?
to make the world a better place .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
i already did my required hours .
that &apos;s a fancy way of saying you &apos;re a virgin .
joke all you want , but this looks good on an application to nyu
or ucla or kfc .
okay , stop trash @-@ talking and start trash picking ... up .
i @-@ i &apos;ll get that .
there he is .
you .
how long &apos;s it been , mr. real estate ?
well , you tell me , mr. you .
i &apos;m usually really good with names and faces ,
but i could not remember who this guy was .
fortunately , i found that one perfectly worded question
can get you all the information you need .
how &apos;s things ?
good .
how &apos;s the beautiful wife ?
claire &apos;s great . yeah .
thank you so much for asking .
how &apos;s ... how &apos;s your situation ?
you know , same old , same old .
actually , i &apos;m glad i &apos;m running into you like this .
my car just got towed ,
and my wallet and cellphone were in there .
could you possibly lend me some money for cab fare or ...
yes .
thanks .
of course .
how &apos;s , uh , $ 40 with a little extra
in case you run into trouble ?
i want to make sure you get back to your house in , uh --
time for dinner , i hope .
thanks , man . you &apos;re the best .
hey , dad .
oh , my god .
last time i saw you , you were so small .
i better run . thanks , pal .
all right , buddy . good to see you .
dad .
that guy just scammed you .
no , he didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s a classic scam .
you pretend you know someone and then borrow money .
okay .
men , gather &apos; round . teachable mome-- hey .
just -- a circle . gather means a circle .
what did you just see ?
a squirrel eating a band @-@ aid .
no . you saw a man helping out a friend in need .
if he was your friend , what &apos;s his name ?
that slipped my mind .
did you recognize him at all ?
gentlemen , don &apos;t be cynics like luke .
don &apos;t let your skinny jeans cut off the blood to your hearts .
i &apos;m with you , phil .
i choose to believe in the goodness of men .
you have a condom stuck to your shoe .
defense also has no objection to juror 14 .
moving on , juror 15 .
here . ask me anything . i am an american .
all right .
when someone hires a lawyer ,
do you think they &apos;re more likely to be guilty ?
no .
thank you .
when they play with their hair like he is ,
that &apos;s when i know that they &apos;re guilty .
your honor , we request dismissal of juror 15 .
why ? i &apos;m very good at reading people .
he is guilty .
and , by the way , so is the guy that is behind him .
he &apos;s not even on trial .
well , then he should be .
i don &apos;t know what you did , but you did it !
your honor .
he &apos;s getting away .
juror 15 , you are dismissed .
ay ! no , please , your excellency .
i just want to do my part as a citizen .
lady , you can stop acting crazy . you got out .
ladies , right this way . come on in .
oh , you &apos;re in grandpa &apos;s office ?
yeah . of course i am .
it &apos;s no big deal . i &apos;m in here all the time .
i mean , practically every day at this ... this point .
this is ...
it &apos;s not usually such a ... thing .
there we go . have a seat .
does that guy with the tattoos still work on the loading docks ?
when i was 15 , he gave me my first catcall .
pretty sure that was his last day .
where &apos;s jay ?
he &apos;s not here , but i &apos;m filling in .
what can i do you for ?
i &apos;ll ask him tomorrow .
are you sure ?
men are often intimidated by a strong , powerful woman .
jay around ?
no , he &apos;s not .
oh , damn it .
captain &apos;s chair is not empty .
i &apos;m here . let me help you .
seriously ?
seriously , huh ?
okay . well , we need to take a delivery of 100 mirrored doors ,
but warehouse one and two are both full .
okay , i know what to do . i &apos;ve got this . uh ...
what if we move the drawers into that busted semi
in loading dock four ?
and that works because--
that frees up warehouse two .
worst @-@ case scenario , we &apos;re a day late on delivery .
but they &apos;ll be mad at us .
we &apos;ll give them a break off shipping ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe like --
10 % ! ha .
we did it . yeah !
good job , team .
you see , what i did there
is i created a framework for problem solving ,
and i didn &apos;t spoon @-@ feed them the answers .
it &apos;s just good management .
yeah .
that &apos;s exactly what it looked like .
hey , jay , i need a decision on that -- oh , boy .
get back here , dom .
what needs to be decided ?
well , we &apos;re throwing that party later for herm &apos;s retirement ,
and jay &apos;s just sort of the master
when it comes to picking out cakes .
oh , i &apos;m here . i can pick out a cake .
ice cream cake .
i don &apos;t know about that .
it &apos;s a cake . it &apos;ll be fine .
okay , is there a number where i could reach ...
just get it .
jay ?
no matter how big or small the issue ,
people want their leaders to be decisive .
oh , definitely .
of course .
what flavor ?
mint chip .
i &apos;ll come back .
i said mint chip !
hey , joe ! you want to ...
i &apos;m like bruce willis in &quot; the sixth sense . &quot;
jay , will you please put the craft table
over on the hemp rug ?
no .
for a word you don &apos;t use , i &apos;m sure hearing it a lot .
that &apos;s the craft table .
you &apos;re holding the feelings table ,
where we talk about how we feel .
hey , mr.table , i feel like breaking you over a hippie .
well , you &apos;re the lawyer .
when can i go to jury duty again ?
you know , i have no idea .
you &apos;re literally the first person who has ever asked that .
i am so frustrated .
this reminds me when i was a little girl in my village
and we had no power .
oh , this is the story about the tv set
powered by the donkey , right ?
no , political power .
we had no say in anything .
but now i am an american ,
so i thought things were going to be different .
i wanted to listen to testimony , look at the evidence ,
have somebody burst in with new information .
mitchell , guess what just happened .
you &apos;re home early .
i have a two @-@ hour lunch monday , wednesday , and friday .
and summers off .
i &apos;m beginning to get the low pay .
this just in .
pepper says he &apos;s not coming if both j &apos;marcus and raymond are here .
&quot; if i wanted this much tension in a space that small ,
i &apos;d go up to my mother &apos;s room . &quot;
that &apos;s not nice .
we can &apos;t afford to have another bad party .
you have to call raymond right now and un @-@ invite him .
i @-@ i can &apos;t believe you and pepper
aren &apos;t being more compassionate about this .
raymond is a human being .
what is the problem with inviting majarcus and roland ?
they had a horrible breakup .
months ago .
gloria , what do you think ?
i think i need to know more before i adjudicate .
adjudicate ?
when the skies were clear and the donkey was very strong ,
we would watch &quot; l.a. law . &quot;
that is the mockup room .
hey , guys .
keep up the mocking .
it &apos;s important to keep it fun .
look at that . the design team &apos;s having a meeting .
what do you say we go in there
and give them a couple &quot; attaboys , &quot; huh ?
no . no , they look really busy .
don &apos;t be silly .
everybody wants face time with the boss .
mom , are you okay ?
alex , i &apos;m fine .
oh , my god .
what ?
your pupil is the size of a nickel .
it looks like half of you went to a rave .
claire , we have a storage problem .
if it &apos;s those mirrored doors , i think i solved that one .
no , some idiot ordered herm an ice cream cake .
i don &apos;t think that name @-@ calling--
wait , how is that a storage problem ?
the damn thing won &apos;t fit in the freezer .
it &apos;s melting like a son of a bitch .
well , then , um , find the smallest room we &apos;ve got
and crank the a / c full blast , hmm ?
that &apos;s a great idea .
thank you .
maybe later , we could turn the heat up in the broom closet ,
bake muffins .
complete disaster .
i &apos;m gonna say something .
you people are being ridiculous .
it &apos;s a freaking mint chip cake .
mint chip ?
yeah , mint chip .
you &apos;re gonna love it .
and if it &apos;s melting , so what ?
we move the party up a little .
in fact , why don &apos;t you tell everybody
to be in the mill in 10 minutes .
but jay &apos;s not here .
yeah , who will give herm &apos;s farewell speech ?
i will .
give him the best farewell speech herm has ever heard .
mom , are you sure you &apos;re up for this ?
yeah , you look a little loopy .
you know what ? i &apos;ll be fine .
just as soon as i figure out who herm is .
keep it up , gentlemen .
hey , dad , remember that time you were getting ripped off ?
you &apos;re still on this .
i took a picture of the guy and sent it to mom .
she swears she &apos;s never seen him before in her life .
your mom could say that
about anyone she met at a party with an open bar .
sounds like someone could use another teachable moment .
i &apos;m good , dad .
men , gather &apos; round .
teachable mo-- mother of ...
luke here still thinks i got ripped off ,
but if that guy wasn &apos;t legit ,
how did he know that luke was my son ?
because i called you dad .
but how did he know that you used to be small ?
i get the problem with that one .
phil , don &apos;t give in to his hipster cynicism .
i admire your childlike faith in people .
and , luke , answer me this .
if this guy is such a con man ,
how did he know your dad was mr. real estate ?
boom !
someone give this kid a mic to drop .
you got me .
i &apos;m actually feeling a little dizzy because of that .
my whole world view has been rocked .
i &apos;m just gonna sit down before i pass out .
pretty smug for a guy sitting on pigeon droppings .
totally worth it .
i was standing outside feeling sorry for myself .
* larry the lonely leopard *
* couldn &apos;t change his spots *
* but once he put his smile on *
* look at all the friends he &apos;s got *
then i realized i was larry the lonely leopard .
i just needed to put my smile on .
that song works on so many levels .
hi , gang . i &apos;m joe &apos;s dad .
anybody want to hear a story ?
that &apos;s a great idea , jay !
okay .
this one &apos;s called &quot; the teeny tiny house . &quot;
&quot; in a teeny tiny town ...
&quot; on a teeny tiny block , &quot;
&quot; stood a teeny tiny house with a teeny tiny -- &quot;
you &apos;re old .
you seen my wife , big ears ?
after that , big ears &apos; parents and i
had to spend a little time at the feelings table .
let me see if i &apos;m understanding this .
so , you have known radar longer ,
but jemima is the fun one .
yes , and kudos for really zeroing in on those names .
come on . raymond &apos;s fun .
name one fun thing he does .
one -- so many things .
okay , this , he does this thing
where he imitates his parents &apos; answering machine .
it &apos;s hilarious . it kills every time .
and it &apos;s j &apos;marcus .
damn it .
mitchell , why is this raymond so important to you ?
what is it that you &apos;re not telling us ?
nothing .
isn &apos;t it true that you have feelings for him ?
no .
admit it . you have a crush on him .
i don &apos;t .
you love him . you want to be with him .
and you won &apos;t stop until cameron is out of the picture .
okay , okay , you &apos;re -- you &apos;re crazy .
then why ?
be--
because i am raymond .
what ?
yeah , if -- if we ever broke up ,
all of our friends would pick you ,
and i &apos;d be the one who &apos;s left behind .
honey , that &apos;s not true .
i would make them invite you to stuff .
he &apos;s lying . i can tell from the way he &apos;s playing with his hair .
no , i @-@ i think you really got to it .
say it . okay , fine . cam !
cam &apos;s the one , all right ? cam &apos;s the one i &apos;m worried about .
he &apos;s the one who &apos;s gonna be left behind .
i rest my case .
well , i don &apos;t rest mine .
why do you think i &apos;m the one that &apos;s gonna be left behind ?
i &apos;m the belle of the ball .
right there -- that &apos;s the type of thing
you should let other people say .
about a woman .
nobody really cares about your political rants .
our friends don &apos;t want to hear about the koch brothers .
unless you &apos;re talking about a couple of hot guys
in a bathroom at a nightclub .
cam , you have no filter .
you say whatever rude thing you &apos;re thinking ,
and that ruffles feathers .
feathers has terrible breath ,
and i was the only one with the decency to tell him .
okay , that &apos;s it . both of you sit down .
i have reached my decision .
raymond is coming to the party .
it &apos;s a smart precedent to set ,
because after what i heard here today ,
i think there is a big chance
that both of you are going to be left out .
you know you &apos;re not under oath , right ?
there he is .
how long &apos;s it been , mr. sport coat ?
and there it was . the ultimate teachable moment .
i guess the answer is nothing .
nothing separates us from animals .
grow up , manny . human beings are basically terrible .
what the hell ?
there he is ! mr. full @-@ of @-@ garbage .
what are you doing ?
payback for turning a bunch of innocent kids into cynics
by preying on my good nature and pretending you know me !
phil -- dr. monty lemon .
i delivered luke .
dr. monty lemon was thinner , had more hair ,
and was a good 15 years younger than you -- oh .
yeah . you &apos;re in my baby photos .
anybody wants cake , grab a cup .
i &apos;ll have some .
it &apos;s mint chip .
did it .
i got herm &apos;s personnel file , and i wrote a kickass speech .
your eye is turning black and blue .
yeah , and -- and what happened to your hand ?
nothing .
i just gashed it trying to get into the filing cabinet .
nothing a stitch or two at urgent care can &apos;t fix .
&quot; boss , &quot; are we gonna do this ?
oh , we &apos;re doing this .
i know it &apos;s been a tricky day ,
but i am so glad the two of you are here to see this .
okay , everyone , gather &apos; round .
just bring it in .
let me get your attention here .
mom ! mom !
stupid ice cream cake .
i &apos;m okay . ooh . oh , god .
mom , stay down .
no . i need this .
i know you think you need to impress us , but you don &apos;t .
you &apos;ve impressed us our whole lives .
and especially today .
nobody but you could put up with this much punishment
and keep going .
it means so much .
it really does , but i &apos;ve got a job to do .
and i &apos;m gonna do it .
herm is so many things to so many people .
to his three sons , he is a role model .
to his wife , dolores , he is a devoted husband .
and to his six rescue beagles , he ...
wrong herm .
what ?
you &apos;re talking about herm anderson .
herm kowalski is the one who &apos;s retiring today .
there are two herms ?
three .
okay , i &apos;m out .
jay ?
in here with the booze .
how are you ?
fine . why ?
the school called ,
and they said that a mean boy made fun of you .
he can probably hear us from here .
kid had ears bigger than stella &apos;s .
other than that , how was it ?
like me in the tube slide -- not a good fit .
just not my thing .
and don &apos;t give me that business about bonding ,
because joe didn &apos;t even know i was there .
well , if it makes you feel any better ,
i got rejected from jury duty ,
so you don &apos;t have to go to school anymore .
mommy ! mommy !
how was your school day ?
best day ever &apos; cause daddy was there .
really ?
did you like daddy being in school ?
he made snacks , he read books ,
and now i call tommy &quot; big ears . &quot;
i &apos;m glad that stuck .
that &apos;s so nice .
daddy , can you come back tomorrow ?
do you really want me to come back tomorrow ?
yeah .
what do you know ?
i &apos;m a hit .
anyone there ?
little help ?
hello ?
tommy ?
tommy .
i &apos;m kind of stuck here .
could you go get a grown @-@ up ?
sorry . can &apos;t hear you .
really ?
with those ears ?
i &apos;m sorry , that was uncalled for .
what do you want ?
money ? i got money .
go ahead , use the credit card .
you spend less than my wife .
