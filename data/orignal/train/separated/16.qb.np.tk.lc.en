第六季 第十集
no , no .
d @-@ don &apos;t put me on hold .
i need tickets for ...
oh , come on !
gosh .
hello , this is ticket hunt .
how may i help you ?
oh , oh , yes , yes .
good , good , a live person .
yes , i @-@ i need two tickets
for the neil diamond concert tonight . i ...
okay , let me check availability .
no , no . d @-@ don &apos;t put me on hold .
it &apos;s for my wife and my anniversary tonight .
it &apos;s for t ... t ...
oh , god .
what &apos;s this ?
where &apos;s carrot ?
they didn &apos;t have carrot ,
they just had banana walnut .
i don &apos;t like banana walnut .
you &apos;re needed in court , your honor .
all rise .
okay , everybody sit .
your honor , i would like ...
no . ms. pine-- what are you doing on your phone ?
if i can &apos;t be on my phone , you can &apos;t be on your phone either .
this is ... this is not carrot .
this ... this is berry of some kind .
oh , mrs. florrick , how are you this morning ?
showing your support ?
hello , your honor .
i &apos;m surprised that you made time for us .
you know , running for state &apos;s attorney and everything .
anyway , everybody in my chambers for a 402 .
you , you , you and you .
let &apos;s go .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m much help here .
we &apos;ll call if we need you .
cary .
it &apos;s odd to be on this side .
i know .
so , where are we at ?
because i really don &apos;t want to be
in that courtroom with you people .
if mr. agos pleads guilty we &apos;re offering ten years .
we &apos;re not taking ten years .
well , you have a loser case , diane .
if you think that , your honor , you should recuse yourself .
no , no . this is off the record , right , judy ?
now , when judy types , history takes notice .
otherwise , i strong @-@ arm both of you ,
and we compromise somewhere in the middle .
that &apos;s a 402 .
i did nothing wrong , your honor .
you &apos;re in my court , young man , that means you did something .
they &apos;re railroading me .
there is a wire that i will allow into evidence
that has you , mr. agos ,
advising drug dealers how to avoid arrest .
your honor , that cannot be allowed into evidence .
it is hearsay .
yeah , and she will argue &quot; forfeiture by wrongdoing . &quot;
and i will overrule your objection ,
because she is right on the law .
and you know that and i know that .
so , take the plea .
no .
all right then , ms. pine .
sweeten the deal .
come on , i &apos;m not your friend here .
six years , that &apos;s the best ...
there we go .
diane , mr. agos ,
this is called compromise .
six years ,
with day @-@ to @-@ day good time ,
that means three years in prison .
what do you say ?
i say no .
it &apos;s three years of your life , cary .
you &apos;ll be a felon .
you won &apos;t be able to practice law .
yes , but like will said ...
&quot; juries are a jump ball . &quot;
judge could be in a bad mood ,
a witness could fall apart , a juror change his mind .
i mean , they &apos;re unpredictable .
i can &apos;t go to jail again .
i was there a week , i can &apos;t even imagine ...
yes , but 15 years ?
if you &apos;re convicted ...
ask polmar .
ask him what ?
ask him whether their bottom line is really three years .
so ...
do you need a lawyer ?
we &apos;re plea bargaining with geneva pine .
they offered cary three years .
we &apos;re wondering what the sa &apos;s bottom line is .
well , you know that it would be unethical for me to answer that .
sorry , would you excuse me ?
hello .
hello , alicia , it &apos;s jackie .
uh , yes .
jackie , i &apos;m at work .
can we talk later ?
no , unfortunately , we can &apos;t .
i &apos;m at grace &apos;s school .
what &apos;s wrong ? what happened ?
oh , nothing , um ...
they couldn &apos;t get hold of you ,
and my name is still on the contact list ...
is grace all right ?
oh , yes , yes . no , everything &apos;s good .
but i think you &apos;d better come down here .
why ?
alicia , did you threaten to kill a teacher with a knife ?
you &apos;re in luck , mr. kernal .
cuesta .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry , sir . i &apos;ve located two tickets for
neil diamond at the chicago state university location .
oh , good , good . can you reserve them for me ?
unfortunately , sir , those tickets will require
your physical presence at the university location .
and that office closes at 5 : 30 .
you &apos;re needed in court , your honor .
uh , hold onto them for me . i &apos;ll be there .
all rise . court is in session .
everybody sit .
ms. lockhart , where are we on the plea ?
we reject the proposed plea offer , your honor .
you &apos;re not helping my day , ms. lockhart .
my apologies , your honor .
so ...
we will continue with voir dire ,
but i want you to know this jury will be seated today .
let &apos;s go . bring &apos; em in .
mrs. florrick , good . maybe you can help us with this ?
hey , mom .
grace .
&quot; dear coach linklater ,
&quot; as i wrote yesterday , grace needs to be excused from running
&quot; in p.e. because she &apos;s contracted a cold .
&quot; if you make her run again ,
&quot; i will personally come down to your office
&quot; and knife you in your lower intestine .
&quot; i will then call principal englehardt to help you ,
&quot; but since he doesn &apos;t receive or accept
&quot; parental calls of concern ,
&quot; you will most probably bleed out .
&quot; thank you for your concern ,
alicia florrick . &quot;
did you write this , mrs. florrick ?
okay .
just to be clear-- it was a joke .
have you ever seen darkness at noon ?
no .
i was just quoting a threat the hero makes to someone .
i wrote it down to make grace laugh .
it was just between us .
it was never meant to be delivered ... to them .
yes , and yet here it is on my desk .
alicia is a good mother . she would never stab a teacher .
thank you , jackie . uh , just to be clear--
it was a joke .
about killing a teacher ?
it wasn &apos;t meant ...
how did it get here anyway ?
grace is in my civics class ,
and we were discussing free speech .
was satire protected as free speech ?
and afterwards i showed her the note .
to ask if this was protected .
and you laughed . you knew it was a joke .
i asked if i could keep it .
to show it to her husband . you said he &apos;d get a laugh , too .
it &apos;s not ms. slavick &apos;s fault she brought it to me .
it &apos;s the responsibility of all teachers
to bring me threats without fail .
this is a threat .
it &apos;s a joke .
we don &apos;t like jokes like that here .
i understand . it won &apos;t happen again .
guys , i think we should leave it there .
good , then that &apos;s it . it was all just a misunderstanding .
and you think you can be impartial during this trial ?
i think i can do my best .
mm @-@ hmm . this juror is acceptable to the defense , your honor .
we challenge this juror .
oh , come on .
your honor , the prosecution has exhausted
its peremptory challenges .
we ask for sidebar conference .
all right , then get up here . come on , fast .
we move to strike for cause , your honor .
this juror has a sister who &apos;s a defense attorney .
your honor , you have accepted another juror
with a policeman brother .
look , you &apos;re wasting your time , asa pine .
i said we &apos;d be done by 5 : 00 .
now , i find this juror acceptable . you are seated , sir .
so that completes voir dire .
and we will begin with opening arguments tomorrow .
your honor , i have a motion .
no , asa pine .
tomorrow . that ends our time today .
and that means ...
oh , you &apos;re here . welcome to your campaign headquarters .
they &apos;re arguing again .
about the interview ?
i have no idea .
i think they just like it .
... eli , not just on a guilty verdict ,
but on a not guilty verdict .
if we make it an issue , it becomes a story .
so we have a problem ?
cary &apos;s trial .
i think if it &apos;s a guilty verdict , we don &apos;t say anything .
we can &apos;t comment while the verdict &apos;s under appeal .
they &apos;re not gonna let you get away with that .
get away with what ? we really shouldn &apos;t be commenting .
it &apos;ll look like she &apos;s betraying her partner .
excuse me-- that &apos;s not yours to say .
i have an opinion .
uh , no , you don &apos;t . not when you &apos;re the body woman .
she &apos;s right , eli . and you &apos;d know that if you &apos;d been with us more .
oh , come on , don &apos;t pull that one .
let &apos;s be honest-- your focus is split .
this story is only going to become a story ...
eli , weekly correspondent &apos;s on one .
oh . here we go .
they want to talk about cary &apos;s trial .
eli , you don &apos;t get to decide this .
we decide this .
hey , brian , it &apos;s johnny .
how are you ?
good . i have a quote i need from you on a story i &apos;m chasing .
hi , brian .
eli &apos;s here , too .
wow , i &apos;ve got the two horsemen of the apocalypse .
what do you need , brian ?
so tell me this isn &apos;t true .
did alicia florrick threaten to murder a chicago teacher
with a knife
and then let him bleed out like a pig ?
uh , what ?
did alicia threaten to knife one of her daughter &apos;s teachers ?
brian , i ...
what are you talking about ?
so that &apos;s an unequivocal no ?
yes , it &apos;s a no . are you insane ?
alicia . i think you &apos;d better hear this .
uh , good talking to you , brian .
anytime you want to know about flying saucers , call us , too .
what was that ?
nothing , he @-@ he ...
we &apos;re good .
he didn &apos;t even mention cary &apos;s trial .
i think you &apos;d better tell alicia what he asked .
no , he was joking .
did you threaten to murder one of your kid &apos;s teachers and
bleed him out like a pig ?
alicia .
well , here &apos;s the thing .
we can &apos;t now . i have to head into court .
no , you can &apos;t call me . not at home .
i can &apos;t leave him . i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m going now .
i &apos;m going .
and don &apos;t smile at me on the stand or i &apos;ll crack up .
name and occupation , detective ?
gary prima .
i &apos;m a detective with the narcotics section
of the chicago police department .
thank you , detective .
and you had a confidential informant
record the defendant committing this crime ?
objection , your honor . argumentative .
that is correct . sustained .
you had the defendant record the defendant ?
the c.i. record the defendant ?
yes . sorry , yes .
that &apos;s okay . trey wagner was a member of lemond bishop &apos;s crew ,
and he agreed to record mr. bishop &apos;s attorney , cary agos .
and do you have that recording for this court ?
objection , your honor . hearsay .
i think we &apos;ve been over this , your honor .
forfeiture by wrongdoing .
yep , as i warned you ,
ms. lockhart , this recording is subject
to a hearsay exception .
so , ladies and gentlemen of the jury ,
i want you to know ... excuse me , gentlemen .
there is no cross talk in the jury box .
the only one in court who should be talking is me . now ,
i will allow this tape to be played ,
but i want you to take into account that the defense
will not be able to cross @-@ examine
the person who recorded the tape .
that person is dead .
so you may feel that this tape is not worthy
of your full consideration
because you &apos;re not hearing both sides of it .
but i leave that to you .
now , ms. pine . ms. pine ?
yes .
ms. pine , you may continue .
yes , your honor .
we ask leave to mark this tape as people &apos;s exhibit number one .
you &apos;re bishop &apos;s lawyer , right ?
yeah . yeah , i &apos;m one of &apos; em .
so i have a question for you .
so you don &apos;t have to show them anything ?
no , no , you just identify yourself .
if you &apos;re not driving a car ,
you don &apos;t need all that .
they can &apos;t search you ?
well , how much are we talking about here ?
uh , 1 and a half kilos .
someone &apos;s having a big party !
damn , man ! what do you got ?
what did i say about jokes ?
it was a joke from months ago .
you said you were gonna stab him .
it was from darkness at noon . i was quoting it .
oh , really ? which episode ?
marissa .
why write the note at all ?
the p.e. teacher was shaming grace into running laps
around the school when she was sick .
so you threatened to kill him .
yes , eli .
i threatened to kill him .
that was a joke . you can &apos;t joke .
what are we gonna say ?
we got to get back to brian at the correspondent .
he &apos;s quoting us saying it &apos;s false .
the note . we have to get the note . who has it ?
the civics teacher .
okay , you need to ...
wait , i thought you said it was the p.e. teacher .
it was addressed to the p.e. teacher .
grace gave it to the civics teacher .
oh , dear god , this is a nightmare .
the only bad people to have in your life are teachers .
i &apos;d trust assassins over teachers .
this was my childhood .
people ask why i turned out the way i did .
so your daughter &apos;s got to get the note back .
you have to call grace .
i got it .
we can &apos;t say it &apos;s a joke .
no , not without a long explanation .
it &apos;s like we &apos;re joking about school violence .
wait . okay .
she cares so much about her daughter ...
she threatens to knife a teacher .
no , no .
alicia didn &apos;t write the note-- her daughter did .
i &apos;m not saying that .
she wrote it as an example of what not to ... something .
no , it &apos;s a joke .
it &apos;s the truth . it &apos;s a joke .
what &apos;s the joke ?
she &apos;s alicia florrick . does she look like the type
who would knife a teacher ? that &apos;s the joke .
sometimes it &apos;s funny to say the thing that &apos;ll never happen .
we &apos;ve all done it .
okay , you need to get the note .
that &apos;s the bottom line . we can spin this ,
but you need to get the note .
grace . uh , we need your help .
do you have civics today ?
detective prima ,
was trey wagner your confidential informant ?
yes , he was .
and when was the last time you spoke with him ?
the last time ? probably ...
two months ago , just before he disappeared .
didn &apos;t you speak with him on the phone a month ago ?
i don &apos;t think asa pine has the answer to that , detective .
objection , your honor . relevance .
well , let &apos;s see where this goes .
then we &apos;ll see how relevant it is .
detective ,
did you speak with trey wagner four weeks ago ?
i spoke to someone who identified himself
as trey wagner ,
but i wasn &apos;t ... i couldn &apos;t be ... sure .
but asa finn polmar assured you
that it was trey wagner ?
yes , he did .
and did this person on the phone tell you
that he had set up cary agos ?
objection , your honor . hearsay .
your honor , the asa has opened
the door by presenting hearsay testimony
from this missing witness .
she should not be allowed
to now argue that these hearsay statements
are inadmissible because they hurt her case .
well , she &apos;s got you there , asa pine .
overruled . you may answer , detective .
yes . this person
said that he had set up cary agos .
and how did he do that ?
by selectively turning the wire on and off
to make mr. agos &apos; statements seem more damning .
and did he say
why he did that ?
he said he was afraid of mr. bishop ,
and he had to get us someone lower .
meaning cary . and how long after he said this
was trey wagner killed ?
objection .
excuse me . how long after this
did trey wagner die in a car accident
that the police have called suspicious ?
48 hours .
i see .
thank you , your honor .
okay , how exciting .
and we are adjourned for lunch .
sweet caroline . ba @-@ ba ...
found it .
uh , hold on , grace . hold on .
&quot; grizzly mom in illinois race shows claws . &quot;
good headline .
where is it ?
buzzfeed . politics .
&quot; don &apos;t get alicia florrick angry .
it &apos;s reported that alicia florrick
threatened a teacher at her daughter &apos;s
tony high school with violence
for forcing her daughter to work out while sick . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t have the note ?
no , it doesn &apos;t .
hi . sorry , grace . what did she say ?
she says she wants to give you back the note ,
but first she wants to meet you in person .
what ? why ?
i don &apos;t know . i think she wants to make sure
you don &apos;t threaten to kill someone again .
dear lord ...
i thought she was nice .
now i &apos;m not so sure .
okay . i &apos;ll call her .
sorry to put you through this .
mom , you didn &apos;t . i did .
no .
i need to stop joking .
they need to get a sense of humor .
okay . love you . bye .
you &apos;re nice with your daughter .
hi , jon . what &apos;s wrong ?
yeah , buzzfeed . the politics section .
yeah , we &apos;re looking at it .
it &apos;s a good headline .
that points to a way out of this .
yeah , hang on a second . i got eli on speaker .
it points to a way out of this .
we need to push you as a grizzly mom .
yeah , i agree .
it &apos;s all about how much you love your daughter .
i tried to stab a teacher because i love my daughter ?
alicia , are you joking ?
remember what i said about joking ?
if we leave it vague , then , uh , we can argue grizzly mom .
but the minute the note is out there , then it becomes
about knives and bleeding out .
so you need to get that note .
yeah , i &apos;m working on it .
i &apos;m really starting to hate those syllables .
are you asking me how i would handle school violence ?
yes , but any school violence .
what are you watching ?
frank prady . with the correspondent board .
well , let me say this ,
if a teacher or a student threatened to knife
a teacher , yes , i would prosecute him .
or her ?
yes .
to the fullest extent of the law .
and , yes , if there were even merely a written threat ,
i would prosecute . school violence
is too serious to treat as a joke .
alicia , he &apos;s coming after you .
we need to use our oppo on him .
yeah , we &apos;re ready to go .
i &apos;ve got two sources that &apos;ll say he &apos;s closeted .
our fingerprints are never on it .
we point the reporter to the source .
they &apos;re starving for it at this point anyway .
if they don &apos;t go for a prady story ,
they &apos;ll go after you for the knifing .
yeah , alicia , we don &apos;t agree on much ,
but we agree on this .
okay , give me till tonight .
alicia ,
remember what i said about things moving fast .
eli , please , we &apos;ll talk tonight .
you gave them reasonable doubt .
i know .
do you know what to do ?
i do .
good .
do it .
we cannot lose this .
so ?
it &apos;s over between us ?
i can &apos;t .
right .
if it were another time .
yeah . now that you don &apos;t need me .
that &apos;s not fair .
okay .
now kick some ass .
yes , your honor . we have another witness .
goody for you .
who is it ?
kalinda sharma .
let &apos;s go . sidebar over .
i strongly object to this breach of protocol ,
your honor .
of course you object ...
she was not on the final witness list , your honor .
your honor , the speedy trial provision
should follow the same freeway .
all right , enough . enough .
the witness is in the woods
and ready to be questioned . so let &apos;s go .
you may proceed .
name and occupation , please ?
kalinda sharma .
i work as a freelance investigator .
and do you primarily work
for mr. agos &apos; firm , funnel , ador &amp; lookout ?
yes . primarily .
to your knowledge ,
did cary agos work for lumar bishop
when he was emperor of the lake district ?
no .
he definitely was not .
kalinda sharma , are you
cary agos &apos; hunter ?
objection , your honor .
this is an old lawyer trick .
i &apos;m not trying to trick .
list pine is lying under the question and possible movement ...
i &apos;ll arm dresser , your honor , and cobbling the witness ...
no , no , no .
this is not a time for a debit .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t hear .
what did she say ?
who say ?
the prosecutor , what did she ask ?
she said , &quot; are you cary agos &apos; lover ? &quot;
... old lumberjack . asking leading questions and making
it appear like the wasted is nothing .
the objection is sustained .
your honor , we ask that you abstract nunneries .
ladies and gentlemen of the jury ,
i ask that you disregard the questions
and answers that you just heard .
they have been deemed inadmissible .
have we been avoiding each other ?
i ... don &apos;t think that we have ,
but ... we should probably talk anyway .
i don &apos;t want to avoid you .
i know .
i @-@ i hate awkwardness at work ...
i do , too . it &apos;s idiotic .
exactly . like high school .
okay , so let &apos;s not .
so here &apos;s the thing ,
i like you as a friend .
and i like you .
it &apos;s stupid to drop a friendship just because ...
exactly .
so here &apos;s what we do . we @-@ we have rules .
good . love it .
we meet in brightly lit diners , not bars .
pancakes , not drinks .
yes . and we ...
talk about ... the law .
great . with accordion music .
well , unfortunately , accordion music kind of turns me on .
okay . no music .
i &apos;ll see you .
so what the hell ?
excuse me ?
you leaked to the press
these two guys who said they had an affair with me ?
i thought we agreed ...
wait , wait , what ?
you leaked to the press ...
i did not .
o @-@ or your people . your handlers did it .
excuse me , we did not .
do we have an agreement or don &apos;t we ?
we said we wouldn &apos;t smear each other .
wait a minute . who &apos;s the one who went to the correspondent
and told them that i should be prosecuted ?
are you serious ?
you wanted to roll a one @-@ day story into a fight .
i didn &apos;t know you threatened to stab a teacher .
the story was already out .
well , so ? they didn &apos;t offer me any context .
they just asked me if i would prosecute a woman
for threatening to stab a teacher , and , yes , oddly enough ,
i said yes . i @-@ i didn &apos;t know it was about you .
then correct it .
correct what ?
tell the correspondent that
you know what i wrote was a joke ,
and that they were wrong to take it out of context .
ah , are we not friends anymore , frank ?
wait a minute . our agreement wasn &apos;t to help each other win .
it was just that we not fight dirty .
and you did .
i didn &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t know what they were saying .
okay .
then let &apos;s just leave it there .
so , you &apos;re gonna let your handlers leak dirt on me ,
dirt you know isn &apos;t true ?
i have no knowledge that my handlers did any such thing .
so we &apos;re right back where we started .
no .
we &apos;re even in the polls now .
well , then , we will return to chambers .
oh , your honor , i object .
and you &apos;re overruled .
sheriff , please excuse the jurors .
uh , all except juror number 11 .
please escort him to chambers .
why ?
what happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
they took our only slam @-@ dunk juror into chambers .
you think geneva &apos;s trying to bounce her ?
him , and it looks like it .
well , how &apos;s the alternate ?
bad .
both are bad .
keep me in touch ?
thank you for coming , alicia .
i know you must be busy .
oh , never too busy for grace &apos;s teachers .
so , i @-@ i know you want this note back .
i &apos;m so sorry how this got blown out of proportion .
i knew you were joking , but the liability issues ...
i understand .
so , grace said you wanted to talk to me ?
my husband works with the teacher &apos;s union ,
and over the last five years , there has been a decrease
in school crime oversight in the s.a. &apos; s office .
really ?
yes .
it &apos;s terrible .
there used to be a task force made up of eight teachers
who would advise the state &apos;s attorney on school crime .
and you would like to have that back ?
yes , we would love to have that back .
with eight positions set aside for teacher union members .
that would be really great for us .
just give it to her .
no . it &apos;s patronage .
well , of course , it &apos;s patronage , alicia .
how do you think this thing works ?
eli , i said &quot; no &quot; to patronage .
and i congratulate you on that stance , alicia ,
but you need this note not to circulate .
alicia , it &apos;s important to show that you stand up to patronage ,
but the key word here is &quot; show . &quot;
there is some patronage that everybody accepts .
your husband accepted ...
exactly . i &apos;m not going to be like peter .
you know . ethics .
mr. fratti , is it ?
it is . what &apos;s wrong ?
have a seat .
i have a note here from an anonymous juror reading ,
&quot; i think juror number 11 might be partially deaf .
&quot; he is having trouble understanding the proceedings ,
and he continually asks those around him what &apos;s going on . &quot;
now , are you partially deaf , mr. fratti ?
no .
your honor , i ...
excuse me . you told us not to talk .
stop it . i @-@ i understand what &apos;s going on here .
ms. lockhart , you think he &apos;s pro @-@ defense ,
and you want him to stay , and , ms. pine , you want him to go .
well , shush , both of you .
now , mr. fratti ,
is there anything that would prevent you
from understanding this trial ?
i didn &apos;t hide anything .
i know that , sir .
is there anything
that would prevent your understanding ?
during certain moments of stress ,
i can suffer from apd--
auditory processing disorder .
and why didn &apos;t you mention this during voir dire ?
because it only rarely affects me ,
which was the question put to me .
on occasion , i can have difficulty
with the sequencing of words , or confuse similar sounds .
but did this affect you during trial ?
no , your honor . i completely followed the trial ,
and i have certain coping mechanisms ...
your honor , this is ...
he says he has followed the trial .
wait , wait , wait .
mr. fratti , i have a question for you .
what waxing the number of the last wideness ?
your honor , it is not a common name .
how is that relevant ?
ms. lockhart , please !
we &apos;re not in a schoolyard .
now , what did i ask you , mr. fratti ?
you asked me the name of the last witness ,
and i think it was kalinda something ?
your honor , may i ask a question ?
no , but i will .
the question , mr. fratti ,
is whether cary agos hurt lemons
bussing the important tree @-@ mills of honeycuts .
um , i &apos;m sorry .
i thought you were innocent .
i need your help , kalinda .
we don &apos;t have a strong enough case .
um , i &apos;m sorry .
i thought you were innocent .
i need your help , kalinda .

we need to get a lead on dante .
bishop &apos;s man ?
yeah . he &apos;s the only one still alive
who heard what was edited out of the wire .
i can &apos;t get anything from finn .
alicia , he knows that cary is innocent ,
he knows this is a wrongful prosecution ,
and he will hear it if you say it .
just ask him for any lead that could get us to dante , anything .
okay , i &apos;ll see what i can do .
you &apos;re kidding me .
&quot; i will personally come down to your office , and knife you
in your lower intestines ... &quot;
&quot; you will most probably bleed out . &quot;
you know , for some reason , i thought this was gonna be funnier .
where is it , on a blog ?
yeah . the correspondent blog .
give her the patronage , alicia .
what &apos;s it matter now ?
you need the union .
i have to go .
order up .

well , you succeeded in finding the ugliest diner in chicago .
well , it helps that we both smell like wet dogs .
and pancakes . perfect .
so , fellow lawyer ...
i have a request that &apos;s gonna make us both uncomfortable .
great . that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
you heard about cary &apos;s trial ?
he lost a juror .
yes .
we need to find dante .
he &apos;s the only one still alive
who can testify that cary &apos;s innocent ,
that the wire was edited .
you know i can &apos;t say anything .
i do .
it &apos;s just , i thought ...
well , that &apos;s not good .
it &apos;s the storm . hold on .
you were saying ?
i was saying ? no , i think you @-@ you were ...
oh , yeah . um ...
yeah .
i can &apos;t say anything .
you &apos;re kidding .
of course .
so , you can &apos;t say anything ?
i can &apos;t .
what &apos;s that ?
i can &apos;t say anything .
surveillance photos from bishop &apos;s house .
anybody entering or exiting .
of course , i don &apos;t know how you got &apos; em , because , uh ,
well ... i can &apos;t say anything .
i wasn &apos;t even there !
yes , you were ! why are you lying to me ?
i &apos;m not lying . you won &apos;t listen .
my dad &apos;s fighting .
he &apos;ll be right here . it &apos;s just his girlfriend .

it &apos;s not ... it &apos;s not your business !
do you work with my dad ?
uh , sometimes .
do you come here after school ?
yeah . why ?
no reason . is that at 3 : 00 ?
okay ? this is not gonna work
if you don &apos;t trust me . you need to trust me .
very adult .
dylan , it &apos;s time to go to bed .
i know .
i love you .
you , too .
what do you need , kalinda ?
dante .
yeah . a lot of people need dante .
why are you coming to me ?
because i think you know where he is .
and if you wanted him to testify , he would .
all right , then maybe i don &apos;t want him to testify .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s a little late .
can @-@ can we do this another time ?
i have some photos i need you to see .
these are state &apos;s attorney
surveillance photos of your house .
kalinda ... i know you like cary ,
but you shouldn &apos;t be here saying that to me .
and you shouldn &apos;t be here with such a weak weapon .
these are four known drug dealers entering your front door .
yeah , well , too bad .
i &apos;m not there . do you see me in that picture ?
oh , you don &apos;t need to be there , sir .
for them to arrest me , i sure do .
this is not about you .
this is about dylan .
there &apos;s enough here for child services to take your son away .
these are copies .
they are not originals .
anyone know you &apos;re here ?
yeah .
what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing ? !
who do you think i am ?
i &apos;m not ...
no . you come here to threaten me ?
you come here to threaten my son ?
i &apos;m not threatening you .
look , we want to help you ...
but ... we need your help .
get out of here , kalinda ...
before i think about this too much .
how did you find dante ?
don &apos;t tell me .
you &apos;re a lifesaver .
looking forward to this being over .
uh , your honor , we have a new name
to add to the witness list-- dante wallach .
dante wallach .
and you know the defendant ?
that guy ? yeah .
and you were in mr. bishop &apos;s kitchen with him
on may 25 of this year ?
yeah .
and did you ask him questions about your business ?
yeah .
and you have heard the prosecutor &apos;s tape
of this conversation ?
the wire ? yeah .
and does this tape ...
reflect your conversation ?
yeah . i @-@ i mean ...
what do you mean ?
did cary tell you
how to break the law ?
yeah .
uh , mr. wallach ,
let me ask you again ...
i think he already answered .
i am asking whether cary told you that he couldn &apos;t help you
break the law .
no , he told us how to break the law .
how to be smart about it .
uh , mr. wallach , excuse me ,
but you told us outside of this court the exact opposite
of what you &apos;re saying here .
nah . maybe you misheard it .
is someone threatening you , mr. wallach ?
objection , your honor . argumentative .
uh , then i need a sidebar , your honor .
sure , come on up . let &apos;s do this .
don &apos;t you ever threaten me again , do you understand ?
get him to tell the truth .
i need to know that you understand , kalinda .
i understand , sir .
now , get him to tell the truth .
that &apos;s your problem .
all right , enough , enough . the witness ...
cary .
look .
i will talk to him again .
no .
you can &apos;t .
you can &apos;t take the plea .
four months ago ...
my life was ... it was just that , it was my life ,
and now i don &apos;t know what it is .
i go from one nightmare to another ,
and i just want it to be over .
they &apos;re gonna convict me .
we don &apos;t have a case .
i look at the jury ...
and they want to put me away .
cary , do you have a minute ?
oh , yeah .
geneva has a new offer .
mr. agos .
hello .
the state &apos;s attorney is prepared to offer time served ,
with six months &apos; probation .
really ?
if you testify against bishop .
i can &apos;t do that .
i understand .
then we &apos;re prepared to offer
a lighter sentence on the conspiracy charge .
four years .
with time served ?
no .
with day @-@ for @-@ day good time , that &apos;s two years in prison .
that &apos;s the best you &apos;ll ever get .
what do you think ?
uh , i think i &apos;m angry .
she &apos;s not wrong , cary .
we go to jury , you might get 15 years .
that &apos;s seven and a half in real time .
or you get out when you &apos;re 37 .
it all comes crashing down .
cary , where are you going ?
i need some air .
how &apos;s he doing ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s so hard .
i can &apos;t imagine being in his position .
where is he ?
um , downstairs walking .
i &apos;m coming over .
yep . i think that would be good .
what do you think he should do ?
take the four years or fight ?
yes .
i have no idea .
oh , did you really threaten to knife
your daughter &apos;s p.e. teacher ?
not one of my better moments .
i &apos;ll see you .
... claiming that the note alicia florrick wrote
in which she threatened to stab a teacher
what ? what happened ?
... was intended as a joke .
mrs. florrick is
a perfect parent .
she was joking with her daughter , that &apos;s all .
i want to be clear .
we take school violence seriously .
but this was purely a misunderstanding .
mrs. florrick
has been a real friend of our school and ...
you guys didn &apos;t ...
didn &apos;t what ?
offer patronage .
i said i wouldn &apos;t do that .
and you didn &apos;t .
you &apos;re saying that these teachers just changed their mind ?
yeah . after getting seats on the illinois safety commission .
peter .
yep . he had some empty seats
on a new commission he formed .
so that &apos;s good--
you didn &apos;t offer patronage .
yep .
cary .
how are you ?
hunky @-@ dory .
would you like to talk ?
sure . why not ?
you &apos;ve been good , cary .
thank you .
i know what you &apos;re up against .
four years .
that &apos;s a hard one .
trial &apos;s not over yet .
yeah .
it is .
they want you .
they &apos;ll get you .
i have a way to move you out of the country .
you won &apos;t be able to return , but i &apos;ll get you an apartment .
i need a legal consultant in europe .
it &apos;ll be good pay .
i &apos;m not being purely selfless .
i need someone loyal that can help me .
where would it be ?
barcelona .
what do you think ?
uh , i think that i can &apos;t do that .
why ?
the firm put up $ 1.3 million .
i jump bail , they don &apos;t get that back .
so send them the money from overseas .
don &apos;t go to jail for four years because of a law firm .
so ...
how &apos;s it going ?
not good , from the sound of things .
momentary setback .
you got to fight it , cary .
no .
no , i don &apos;t .
four years .
two years for good behavior . and you didn &apos;t do it .
i know .
i &apos;ll be 37 . i can do that .
i can &apos;t do 15 years .
dear lord , cary .
what are you gonna do ?
the choices have been reduced .
we can appeal . i mean , you take the plea ,
you can &apos;t appeal .
alicia ...
i have watched you long enough with clients to know
when you have a case or when you don &apos;t .
the smart deal here is to take the plea .
you &apos;ll come and see me ?
i will .
good , good .
i don &apos;t want to be lonely .
would you like to revise your plea , mr. agos ?
yes , your honor . i would like to plead guilty .
