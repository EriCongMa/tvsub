whoa . what &apos;s all this ?
mom heard us say we were bored .
suckers .
she heard us from outside .
she has super good hearing , like a seeing eye dog .
they have overdeveloped hearing to make up for the fact that--
wait , the dogs aren &apos;t blind .
wait . are they ?
no , that wouldn &apos;t make sense .
you &apos;re right .
if i wait long enough , she can get there by herself .
quick , girls--
famous danny from &quot; moonstruck . &quot;
aiello ?
&#91; danny aiello &#93;
hey , phil . i &apos;m glad i caught ya .
what &apos;s up ?
uh , it &apos;s about steven and stefan .
they wanna see that house on briar again .
really ? i showed it to them five times .
last time we were there , i think they got mail .
yeah , well , that &apos;s why i &apos;m calling .
they hate upsetting people , unless , of course , it &apos;s me .
then they don &apos;t mind waking me up at 7 : 00 a.m. ,
asking me to call you .
it &apos;s no problem . i &apos;m just hanging around .
kind of bored , really .
what ?
well , we did our good deed for the day .
yeah , for the enemy . don &apos;t they have enough ?
it &apos;s been about a year since we decided to adopt a boy .
meanwhile , our friends steven and stefan
decided that they wanted a baby , too .
wonder where they got that idea ?
well , we &apos;re still waiting , but they already got their kid
because they went through a surrogate .
which is all they talk about .
are you gonna keep doing that ?
i might .
i have to go show a house .
but first , what was elton john &apos;s sexual orientation in the &apos; 70s ?
bye .
you &apos;ve done that one before .
and it never gets old ,
like the good captain fantastic himself .
hey , claire , guess what ?
i &apos;m sorry , honey , i can &apos;t talk right now .
i told bethenny i would take her to the airport .
i &apos;m late , and she &apos;s gonna miss her flight . where are my keys ?
why is that chair still here ? i thought you and luke
were gonna put it out on the sidewalk .
so you can &apos;t talk unless it &apos;s about my chores ?
why don &apos;t you just do it now , and you won &apos;t be so bored ?
you heard that ?
i hear everything .
that &apos;s for me .
hey , leon . nice buzz cut .
yeah , for some people , the shampoo doesn &apos;t work .
it only makes the lice angry .
nice to see you .
oh , no . no--oh , god .
um , alex , do not move .
haley , clean this up , okay ?
who fills a vase with marbles ?
who doesn &apos;t see a vase filled with marbles ?
who wants to hear a bunch of plates crashing ?
phil ! honey , the girls need you in the kitchen !
thanks for the hat , leon . it kind of tickles .
phil !
how much electricity do we need to bring this back ?
it &apos;s not rocket science .
we &apos;re only reanimating a squirrel .
phil ! now !
第三季 第十五集
sounds great . no , hang on .
gloria , where &apos;s manny ?
some neighborhood kids have invited him to play football .
he said he was taking his morning constitutional .
he &apos;s working on his go @-@ cart , but he &apos;ll be there .
okay . see you then .
no , manny cannot go and play with those boys .
margo is trying to get us theater tickets for this afternoon .
gloria , you and manny do enough together .
let &apos;s let him decide . where &apos;s he walking ?
i don &apos;t know . but according to the song he was singing ,
he was going to the sunny side of the street .
i cannot express to you enough how bad this kid needs football .
mom ! look what i found !
number 99 !
when manny was 5 , we didn &apos;t have much .
we were on our own .
so we always dreamed of winning the lottery .
we figured if we collected 100 lucky heads @-@ up pennies
and bought a ticket with them , we couldn &apos;t lose .
but now i have a wonderful husband ,
a beautiful home ...
i feel like i already won the lottery .
so i can keep whatever we win ?
i think no . i found most of them .
can you put this in the jar with the others ?
si .
ay . i forgot .
what is the combination to your safe ?
i &apos;ll just come with you .
oh , yes , &apos; cause that &apos;s how this arrangement works--
i take money from you !
hello ?
oh , hi , margo . no , she just ran upstairs .
listen , about these theater tickets--
don &apos;t knock yourself out trying to ...
oh , you did ?
well , sorry to do this last minute ,
but they can &apos;t go .
no , manny has a football game , so ...
jay , could you steep my tea ?
i cannot express to you enough how much this kid needs football .
and that is the whole house ...
again .
i love it , but i just don &apos;t love it .
do you love it ?
i love it . i absolutely love it .
i &apos;m just not sure if i &apos;m in love with it .
oh , yeah .
we have an expression around the office
for when a sale just isn &apos;t happening--
&quot; commission : impossible . &quot;
maybe for some people .
not sure if i mentioned it before ,
but the house does come with a hookup
for a european washing machine .
oh , i love that .
oh , so sorry .
it &apos;s the boss .
hi . i &apos;m on my way home .
i &apos;ve been calling haley , but nobody &apos;s answering .
is everything okay there ?
everything here is great .
oh , thank god . did you put the chair out front ?
not yet .
honey , you &apos;re gonna miss the trash pickup .
don &apos;t worry . if they don &apos;t take it , someone else will .
who is gonna pick up
that ratty chair off our lawn ?
are you kidding ? it &apos;s in great shape .
super cozy . people are always commenting on it .
trust me , it &apos;ll be gone by the end of the day .
please , just do it now .
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m so sorry .
when i &apos;m done with these clients ,
i &apos;ll call luke and leon .
i know i can talk them into it .
we are not losing this house to luke and leon .
what do you mean , &quot; call luke and leon &quot; ?
aren &apos;t you at home ?
no , i left right before you did .
phil , the house ... the--the kids ...
oh , god , the squirrel .
hello ?
we &apos;ll take it .
commission ...
accomplished .
so how great is your life right now , huh ?
a new house , a new baby ,
stefan &apos;s propecia &apos;s kicking in .
that &apos;s him . he &apos;s on his way .
he texted &quot; o.m.w. &quot;
we try to keep our texts short
when we &apos;re driving with the baby .
oh , well , what wonderful parents you are .
you guys hate us a little bit , don &apos;t you ?
no . god , no .
just a little .
have you thought about surrogacy ?
at least you &apos;d be making a baby
instead of waiting around for some pregnant mom
to maybe pick you .
well , we considered it ,
but how do you decide which one will--where &apos;s lily ?
sleeping .
ice the cupcake .
that you couldn &apos;t say in front of lily ?
well , then , she &apos;d want a cupcake . yeah , well ...
but that &apos;s the beauty of the swirl .
the swirl ?
you both donate , they mix it up ,
fertilize the egg .
you never know who the father is .
ooh . that &apos;s stefan .
yeah , maybe we should think about this swirl .
well , i @-@ i didn &apos;t think surrogacy was for us .
but , you know , &apos; cause one of us would feel left out .
yeah , but if you don &apos;t know whose it is ...
sorry we &apos;re late .
guys , meet roco .
roco or cocoa ?
混捐属于自欺欺人 &#93;
look at him out there .
oh , ay . this is so exciting .
go ahead ! attaboy !
go ! go ahead ! attaboy !
go , manny ! run !
i knew gloria would find out i lied about those tickets .
but i figured when she saw manny out there ,
playing with all those other kids ,
she &apos;d thank me .
that &apos;s what i figured .
go ! go !
what the hell &apos;s he doing ?
run , manny ! run !
mom ! number 100 !
now we have the lucky--oh !
oh , thank god .
nobody &apos;s dead .
or ... we &apos;re all dead .
how many plates did we lose ?
none . luke and haley used cookie sheets
to clear a path through the marbles for me .
where are the marbles ?
right here .
oh , haley !
i put glue on them so it doesn &apos;t happen again .
what about the chair ?
leon and i rolled it outside on some skateboards .
the squirrel ?
you think i was going to let that happen ?
these kids are going to survive .
they are the best of me and phil .
luke using the skateboards , haley gluing the marbles--
that is pure phil .
alex keeping everyone in line--
pure me .
sometimes i worry no one &apos;s gonna like alex .
there you go , buddy .
thank you .
what ? you need anything ? i &apos;ll get it .
steak sauce , but it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s probably good for me to move around .
oh , jay , it &apos;s so nice to see you take care of him like that .
why are you surprised ? he &apos;s our kid .
we take care of each other in this family .
i want to kill you .
wild guess--margo ?
let me explain .
there is no excuse .
this is something private . i &apos;m gonna get outta here .
so that &apos;s why you were being so nice .
you lied to my friend ...
you made manny play the american football ...
it is your fault that he got estamped .
or is it your fault ?
he stopped to pick up a penny , for god sake .
be careful what you say , jay .
you &apos;re skating on thin eggshells right now .
i tried to get him out there
with kids his own age ...
which is what he should be doing ...
and not spending another afternoon with his mommy .
if you have a problem with the way manny &apos;s being raised ,
you talk to me !
i am .
i don &apos;t wanna hear it !
phil , you really didn &apos;t have to do this .
i sold a house today because of you two .
the least i can do is buy you dinner .
i saw that house . it is gorgeous .
i know .
we &apos;re real happy for them .
they showed me a picture of the baby .
how adorable is that little guy ?
yes , we &apos;re real happy for them .
okay , you might wanna slow down there .
what ? i &apos;m playing a new drinking game .
it &apos;s called &quot; every time i &apos;m depressed , i take a drink . &quot;
that game exists .
it &apos;s called alcoholism .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , you &apos;re right . i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m wallowing , and it &apos;s not cute .
to happier things .
yes . to happier things .
happier things ,
yes .
there you go .
i remember the first few drinks ...
and , um , after that , the night &apos;s just bits and pieces .
i wanna do something i never do--
brag about my kids .
today , they were resourceful ,
they were responsible , they ...
put 40 % down .
it was worth showing the house five times
and waiting ...
almost a year .
seriously ! who do you have to ...
blow . that &apos;s really hot .
why don &apos;t you let it cool down ? try some of the ...
mexican !
the baby is clearly mexican !
so , you know , the swirl is out .
ugh . it &apos;s enough to make you lose ...
track .
is this my fourth drink ?
it &apos;s my fourth .
i said &quot; four &quot; twice , didn &apos;t i ?
i did , didn &apos;t i ?
i think we &apos;re gonna need four cabs ...
two !
two ! you made me !
i @-@ i vaguely remember ... someone crying ?
if we ever did surrogacy ,
i would want you to be the donor .
you &apos;re so smart , you &apos;re so handsome .
oh , stop it ! it should be you !
you &apos;re so fun ! you &apos;re so talented !
okay .
it &apos;s not fair . i love you both so much .
if you could have a baby
that was a mix of the two of you ,
i would love that baby so much .
that is so sweet .
i meant it .
that is so sweet .
oh , my god . you guys , we could do this .
we could do this .
we could make a baby
that is half tucker and half pritchett .
are you saying what i think you &apos;re saying ?
yeah .
cloning ?
no . no .
i &apos;m saying ...
i give the egg .
yeah .
i give the egg . that &apos;s the pritchett side .
and then , cam , you &apos;re the father , right ?
and then we just , like , mix it
and put it in a , like , a surrogate lady thing ,
and then bang ! we have a baby .
oh . are--are you serious ?
you would do that ?
i would be honored .
you guys , you guys , if there &apos;s one thing i have learned today ,
it &apos;s the pleasure of looking at your children ,
and seeing both-- both of you in there .
and i want you to have that experience .
yeah . we want that .
and something else ...
guys , i make really good babies .
yes .
i have , like , magic eggs or something .
yes !
they &apos;re golden .
oh , gosh . oh , phil ,
i don &apos;t--what do-- what do you say about this ?
i think we &apos;re all having a baby !
aah ! table hug !
sweet potato fries !
what have i done ?
i know .
what was i thinking ?
i @-@ i @-@ i just get drunk and i bring a baby into the world ?
that would be 4 for 4 .
i can &apos;t go through with it .
don &apos;t panic . you haven &apos;t donated anything yet .
besides , what are the chances your eggs even work ?
what are the chances we can pretend i never said that ?
it &apos;s weird . it &apos;s my brother .
and then there would be this baby over there
that &apos;s my baby , but it &apos;s not my baby ...
that actually sounds good . just say that .
we &apos;re gonna see him for brunch in two hours over at your dad &apos;s
ooh . that seems ... soon
and--and hard .
what if ... what if i blame it on you ?
what if we say that you &apos;re not okay with it ?
no !
why ?
are you really okay with another man fertilizing your wife &apos;s egg ?
of course not ! that &apos;s creepy .
yes .
plus , what if you and cam make a better baby than we did ?
it &apos;s settled . phil says &quot; no . &quot;
like they &apos;re really gonna believe that i overruled you ?
right .
come on .
they &apos;re gonna be crushed .
they &apos;ve waited so long for this baby .
maybe they &apos;re having second thoughts , too .
look--this is what my baby with claire would look like .
what is this ? what ...
okay , well , i found a web site where couples can upload pictures ...
and then it shows them what their baby would look like .
this is ... gloria and i.
couldn &apos;t resist .
wow . that-- that looks exactly like manny .
like--like weirdly so .
what--what &apos;s this other picture ?
don &apos;t be jealous .
but this ...
is me and justin timberlake .
cam , we have a problem .
oh , what ? you can talk about ryan gosling all day ,
but the moment i say something--
no , no , no ,
about this baby . i ...
i don &apos;t think i can do it .
what--why ? why--it &apos;s perfect !
it &apos;s our chance to have a baby that &apos;s part me , part you !
no , no ! it &apos;s part you and part claire .
i &apos;m nowhere in there .
and it &apos;s not like i can pretend .
it &apos;s--she &apos;s not some egg donor that we don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s claire .
you know , we see her all the time .
and what are we supposed to tell the baby ?
&quot; say hi to your aunt mommy ! &quot;
adorable .
no , not adorable .
appalachian .
okay , i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry , cam .
jay says that i &apos;m smothering manny ...
but i &apos;m just enjoying him .
i mean , they &apos;re only gonna be boys for a short time .
best time ever in this house !
i &apos;m uncomfortable with this , phil .
the manual specifically says &quot; no towing . &quot;
there are two types of people in this world--
people who follow the manual ,
and people who stick it to the manual .
you ... are hurt .
manny , what happened ?
football injury .
my mom will yell you all about it .
hola , lily !
does my little princess want a cookie ?
oh , well , you know , maybe just one .
she &apos;s already had her sugar limit for today .
how can you tell ?
okay , lily .
hey , you two .
so where-- oh , where are the kids ?
oh , haley &apos;s driving them over separately .
oh ! big girl now .
that &apos;s great .
yeah
so that was ... so fun last night .
so fun .
yeah , we had a great night .
yes .
we should--
jinx !
yeah , we &apos;re going this way , so ...
we &apos;ll see you in a bit .
i cannot tell them .
i cannot break their hearts .
so you &apos;re gonna have cam &apos;s baby just to keep things from being weird ?
um , what ?
you and uncle cam are having a baby ?
kids , shh .
there was a discussion about the possibility
of your mom donating an egg
so that the guys could have a baby .
but we decided it was not a good idea .
why ? because lily &apos;s such a mess ?
for a lot of reasons .
they have--
but we can agree that she &apos;s a disastrous human being ?
i think it &apos;s a great idea .
yeah . it &apos;s a really beautiful offer , mom . i &apos;m impressed .
oh , my god . cam , they told the kids already ,
and they seem to be totally into it .
all right , is it just me ?
am i the only one that thinks this is weird ?
maybe it &apos;s not weird .
maybe we &apos;re pioneers .
no , we &apos;re hardly pioneers .
you have three different hair dryers for different types of weather .
maybe it &apos;s just gonna take some time to get used to the idea .
what idea ?
oh . no .
um , well , jay ...
cam .
claire has--
no . i @-@ i @-@ i just don &apos;t think
my dad &apos;s really ready for this conversation . so ...
oh , stop acting like i &apos;m some stodgy old coot . i &apos;ve grown .
okay .
um , jay , claire has , um , offered to give us one of her eggs
so we can have a baby
that &apos;s half pritchett , half tucker .
that &apos;s unnatural . i &apos;m against it .
oh , surprise , surprise . jay is against something .
cam and claire wanna have a baby together .
you &apos;re not gonna do that .
it &apos;s not your decision , dad .
you &apos;re not thinking straight .
and you &apos;re not in charge . okay , claire and i are adults .
if--if we want this to happen , it--it &apos;s gonna happen .
so much for second thoughts .
young lady , i need to have a talk with you .
i don &apos;t ...
no .
you don &apos;t get to tell everyone how to live their lives ,
that boys cannot spend time with their mommies
or that brothers and sisters can &apos;t make babies .
so you &apos;re all for this ?
no .
it &apos;s a freak show , but it &apos;s their freak show .
so this is happening again ?
well , i &apos;m not gonna not do it
&apos;cause my dad thinks i shouldn &apos;t .
you know , i &apos;m not following .
we &apos;re not doing it &apos; cause i don &apos;t want to do it .
what we &apos;re not doing
is not doing it &apos; cause he doesn &apos;t want us to do it .
just say baby or no baby .
isn &apos;t it enough this family spends a lot of time together ?
now we have to inbreed .
okay , dad , it &apos;s not technically inbreeding . it &apos;s , um ...
for the record , i think what my mom is doing is very brave .
i like it .
i &apos;ve always kind of wanted a half @-@ brother , half @-@ cousin .
really ? &quot; always &quot; ?
well , i mean , if you think about it ...
when was the last time we talked under a table ?
dad and gloria &apos;s wedding reception .
oh , yeah .
i love you . you know that ...
but i can &apos;t do this .
no , no , neither can i !
really ?
yeah .
are you serious ? you can &apos;t--oh , god .
i &apos;m so relieved . i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i @-@ i ...
i am so sorry i led us down this road .
no , no . no , claire , don &apos;t be . don &apos;t be .
it was--it was generous and thoughtful , just like you .
how could i not want those qualities in my child ?
oh , come here .
so this is really happening ?
ah . what if it is , dad ?
yeah . what if we love each other ,
and this is a beautiful thing ?
okay , it &apos;s our decision . it &apos;s not yours .
yeah .
so baby ? no baby ?
no .
you okay ?
oh , yeah . i &apos;m fine .
mm , i know it &apos;s been hard on you .
hey , what if we went out for a nice dinner tonight ?
oh , that &apos;d be fun . should i call the sitter ?
yeah . oh , you know what i was thinking today ?
what about luke ?
oh , he &apos;s so good with her ,
the way he looks at her ...
my god , cam .
oh , look , she &apos;s organizing her things .
look at how she &apos;s dressed .
we didn &apos;t make her , but she sure is us .
hey , lily , honey , it might make more sense with the shoes ...
mitchell .
i like what she did with the dolls--
play as you will . play as you will .
the big one , remember ?
one of the first ones we found .
it was at the bottom of the gutter in the street .
ay , yes .
we put the gum at the bottom of your walking stick .
ay , look at this one-- the green one ,
the one we found at the floor of my taxi .
your taxi ?
yes .
before i had somebody running my life for me ,
i used to drive a taxi at night .
manny would sleep in the seat next to me .
one time , i had to hit the brakes so hard
that he fell into the floor and he found the penny .
pretty lucky , huh ?
eight years . i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re finally done .
me , either .
come . let &apos;s go get your lottery ticket .
gloria .
i think you made a mistake here .
what did i do now ?
i counted these , and you &apos;ve only got 96 pennies .
are you sure ?
afraid so .
i guess you &apos;re gonna have to keep lookin &apos; .
dang it ! i counted those .
see for yourself .
and now we upload your picture .
this is fun . this is fun .
and in just a few short moments ,
thanks to the magic of technology ...
we &apos;ll know what our baby actually looks--
oh ! no !
what happened ? what is that ?
did you put one of us in upside @-@ down ?
no ! that &apos;s actually--
okay , i @-@ i don &apos;t want to see this anymore .
ohh . turn it off .
oh , it &apos;s not turning off .
well , throw something over it ! that--oh , god !
yeah , well , we played god , and look what we brought forth .
daddies , what are you looking at ?
maybe it wasn &apos;t that bad .
no , no , it &apos;s possible that we overreacted .
yeah . maybe our expectations were just a little bit too high .
that little guy had some cute features . huh ?
of course he did . it &apos;s us . it can &apos;t be that bad .
