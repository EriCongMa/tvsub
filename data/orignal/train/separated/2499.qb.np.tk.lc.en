our journey begins 65 million years ago
when amazing creatures took their first steps .
it &apos;s so cute that all these children
are excited to see their favorite dinosaurs .
these aren &apos;t dinosaurs !
dinosaurs sing !
i want to go back in mommy !
i paid $ 800 for five minutes !
the dinosaurs ruled the earth for millions of years ,
until a massive asteroid collided with the earth ,
bringing their reign to an end .
ex @-@ tinct !
so remember , take good care of the earth ,
or we could suffer the same fate as the dinosaurs .
ooh , kids , did you hear that lesson ?
how is that the lesson ?
the point of the dinosaurs is ,
no matter what we do , an asteroid &apos;s gonna wipe us out ,
so we should party hard and wreck the place !
yeah ! why should the asteroid have all the fun !
what ? they &apos;ve got a point .
gift shop ! gift shop !
all right , you can each have one toy .
lisa has a big toy .
no fair . that means i get two small toys .
no fair . this isn &apos;t big , it &apos;s medium !
no fair ! then i get four small toys and lisa gets
one medium and one small .
what ? ! he gets four and i only get two ?
no fair !
all right , that &apos;s it ! forget it !
no toys for anyone !
okay , maggie gets a toy .
no fair !
no fair !
choke on fossil poop !
hey , i know you .
wait ! wait ! come back !
dad , follow that dinosaur !
i &apos;ve waited my whole life to hear that .
triceratops head ...
coming through !
stegosaurus back plates , used for either defense
or control of body temperature , coming through !
so tired .
go on without me .
you &apos;re t.r. francis !
you wrote the angelica button books .
都喜欢的科幻书和电影系列的主角
they &apos;re my favorite fantasy novels .
um , yes , it &apos;s me ,
the creator of your beloved magical world ,
full of whimsy and , uh ...
chapters .
now , off you go . bye @-@ bye , now .
but why are you working at a dinosaur show ?
and why did you run away from me ?
and how did angelica get a new wand
after baron mortdeath burned the wandwood forest ? and ...
look , you seem like a smart kid ,
so here &apos;s the truth .
t.r. francis isn &apos;t real .
of course you &apos;re real .
everybody knows you got the idea for this series
after an explosion at a crumpet factory
knocked you off a double @-@ decker bus .
how could that be made up ?
i &apos;m just an actress they use for the jacket photo .
that inspirational life story is pure fiction .
oh , i hate to break it to you ,
but all the books you kids love
are conceived in executive boardrooms .
the plots are based on market research ,
and the pages are churned out
by a room full of pill @-@ popping lit majors
desperate for work .
publishers rake in the cash , and unsuspecting kids
get ten books a year
by their favorite &quot; author . &quot;
everything i believed about &quot; young adult &quot; literature
is a lie !
it &apos;s not against the law to sleep in a tyrannosaurus head .
sir , you &apos;re inside an allosaurus .
i demand to speak to my paleontologist !
can i buy lance early ?
i need to buy some carbon @-@ offset credits
so i can burn all my angelica button books .
oh , honey , i &apos;m sorry your book lady
turned out to be a dinosaur .
but you liked the stories when you read them .
so what does it matter ?
doesn &apos;t it bother you that betty crocker
is an invention of &apos; 20s @-@ era ad men ?
i know you &apos;re hurting , but that &apos;s no reason
to lash out at me .
can you believe publishers would lie to their readers
just to make an easy million bucks ?
a million bucks ? !
every book on the &quot; young adult &quot; charts
is written by five idiots
who just want to take advantage of kids .
i know five idiots !
and they just cash their checks and get away with it every time .
it &apos;s the perfect crime .
as long as you don &apos;t mind betraying the trust
of vulnerable young minds .
the perfect crime , eh ?
whatever the job is , i &apos;m not interested .
a million bucks has changed stupider minds than yours .
i like the beat , play me the tune .
we &apos;re taking down kids who read .
chapter @-@ book crowd ? that &apos;s a juicy peach .
but what &apos;s the cream ?
i &apos;m putting together a tween @-@ lit gang @-@ write .
tween @-@ lit gang @-@ write ?
tween @-@ lit gang @-@ write .
but this babar needs a zephyr .
babar为象王 zephyr为最年迈的猴长老
a zephyr ?
you &apos;re the zephyr .
this better not turn out like kansas city .
it won &apos;t be like kansas city .
come on ,
skinner , you &apos;re the best kid @-@ man in the business .
you &apos;ve read their notes , searched their lockers--
you know how tweens think .
oh , no , thanks , gentlemen ,
i &apos;ve got a nice , quiet life here
and i mean to keep it that way .
your friends are looking at my bloomers !
wash &apos; em again !
with your share of the money ,
you could get your own studio apartment .
the refrigerator could have my magnets on it .
i &apos;m in .
come on , beautiful , i can &apos;t do the job without you .
so , what do you say ...
our crew needs you , bouvier .
you &apos;ve read enough fantasy novels
to choke a hippogriff .
it &apos;s true .
i &apos;m fluent in every imaginary language ,
from dothraki to parseltongue .
i wouldn &apos;t join one of your harebrained schemes
for all the japanese girlfriend pillows in kyoto !
we &apos;re not here for you , we &apos;re here for lenny .
sorry , guys .
i just adopted a capuchin monkey ,
and i can &apos;t leave it alone during the bonding phase .
wait , wait , wait , i want in !
what does your crew need , a safecracker ?
a @-@ a wheel man ?
the caper is writing a kids &apos; fantasy novel .
well , i , uh , i don &apos;t like to brag about it , but i did publish
five modestly successful children &apos;s books .
all we need now is a computer guy .
do you have a computer ?
uh , yes .
you &apos;re in .
in what ?
i keep going over the job from every angle ,
but i can &apos;t shake the feeling that we &apos;re missing something .
relax . with the team we put together ,
our book &apos;ll fly off the shelves ,
and we &apos;ll be sipping mai tais on a beach in shelbyville .
you &apos;re group @-@ writing a book ?
but the only reason anyone would ever do that is ...
profit !
like no one ever writes for money , lisa .
i don &apos;t see your boyfriend william shakespeare
missing too many meals .
i &apos;ll show you !
i &apos;ll write a book myself !
a personal story my readers will connect with .
wait , you &apos;re gonna be all the guys ?
how would that work ?
this is how real writers do it .
i &apos;ll just bang out 2,000 words , and then i &apos;ll stop--
even if i &apos;m on fire .
i got to pace myself .
chapter one .
wait . i can &apos;t start without music to inspire me .
why is bach next to muddy waters ?
sebastian bach 加拿大籍重金属歌手
that &apos;s my problem-- i got to get these cds organized .
there . finished .
now , if i win just two more games of online boggle ,
i &apos;ll be ready to start writing .
spot , stop , sop , top @-@ tops ,
pot @-@ pots , opt @-@ opts ...
post !
okay , we &apos;ve cased a lot of tween books .
what &apos;s their m.o. ?
the heroes are all orphans .
and they &apos;re set in a place kids relate to--
say ... a school--
but it &apos;s actually magic .
and the protagonist always discovers
that he is supernatural .
okay , our book will be about
an orphan who goes to a magical school
where he discovers he &apos;s ... a vampire !
vampires ...
like these ?
or those ?
or these guys ?
so many vampires ! with the fangs and the capes
and the medals-- nobody knows how they earned them .
hey , this job &apos;s falling apart .
everyone head for a different airport ,
and we meet in rio in a year with new faces .
no one &apos;s going anywhere .
okay . the vampire genre is sucked out .
all we got to do is find a new monster to be our hero .
aah ! a troll !
hey , i ain &apos;t a troll .
look , i bleed red , just like you .
th @-@ the first part is always green , but it turns red .
a troll ! that &apos;s it !
our book could be about an orphan troll !
trolls live under bridges--
the school should be under a bridge .
the brooklyn bridge !
and the cool kids are elves .
the cheerleaders are pixies .
the stoners are ...
gargoyles !
and they play a complicated sport
which makes no sense called fuzzlepitch !
oh , yeah , yeah , that &apos;s good !
we &apos;ve cracked it .
we &apos;re gonna be rich !
pardon me ,
but are you scheming to coauthor
a successful series of children &apos;s fantasy novels ?
okay , stonehenge , let &apos;s see how good you are at eavesdropping
without a throat !
don &apos;t kill him ! that &apos;s neil gaiman .
i don &apos;t care if he &apos;s the guy who wrote sandman volume one :
也非魔鬼更不是超级英雄的 &quot; 梦之主宰 &quot;
preludes and nocturnes--
no one spies on us !
perhaps someone of my experience
would be a valuable addition to your ... crew .
the king of fantasy books on our fantasy book @-@ writing team ?
okay , gaiman , you &apos;re in .
your job is to get lunch .
and lose the british accent .
cheeseburgers , french fries .
i &apos;m all over that , pal .
sitting in a coffee shop .
i couldn &apos;t feel more like a real writer .
oh , i better set up my wi @-@ fi , in case i need to do some research .
but if i &apos;m gonna use their free internet ,
i really should buy something .
god , i love being a writer !
&quot; and so , lucinda placed the fifth shard
&quot; in the stained @-@ glass window , which now clearly read ,
&quot; &apos; your parents are alive.&apos;
&quot; gregor turned to his twin sister ,
&quot; and they both understood ,
their journey was just beginning . &quot;
the end .
it &apos;s good .
weekly reader star selection good .
i just hope we put in enough steampunk , whatever that is .
用于着重表现那些工业革命的早期科技
who wants to see my cover ? mock @-@ up
&quot; the troll twins of underbridge academy . &quot;
i &apos;m so proud of us .
oh , you didn &apos;t write any of it .
that tuna didn &apos;t salad itself .
i &apos;ve got it !
a mermaid falls in love with a boy on land .
i &apos;m a genius !
writing is the hardest thing ever !
hope you don &apos;t mind us printing our book in your room , lis .
yeah , only your professional @-@ strength
output tray can handle the weight of our manuscript .
correction . finished manuscript .
trolls in a magical prep school under the brooklyn bridge ?
interesting .
this is a really good book .
we know . we wrote it .
i laminated the lunch menu and put them in a binder .
but we have a problem here . where &apos;s your fake author ?
fake author ?
fake author !
if you don &apos;t have a made @-@ up author
with an inspirational tale , you don &apos;t have a book !
where &apos;s your franklin w. dixon ?
where &apos;s your t.r. francis ?
where &apos;s your stephen king ?
stupid , stupid , stupid !
we forgot to create a fake author !
that was gaiman &apos;s job .
let &apos;s acid melt him in a bathtub !
okay , stay frosty .
all we need to do is find some sap
to pretend to be the writer of our book .
so hit the floor and find some pathetic wanna @-@ be author .
coming to the book fair sure was a great idea .
&apos;cause you can &apos;t write
if you don &apos;t know what the competition &apos;s up to !
a dog wrote a bestseller ? !
all i &apos;ve done is procrastinate !
ah , who am i kidding ?
there will never be a book with my name on it .
or ... your name could be on a book in ten minutes .
do i have to do any writing ?
no .
i &apos;m in .
ah , a preteen prodigy .
i like the hook . what &apos;s the phony back story ?
i was raised in a traveling circus .
my mother was a lady ringmaster , and my father was a lion barber .
i wrote my first story with clown lipstick
on a flattened popcorn box .
it was featured in the new yorker &apos;s
&quot; best forty under four &quot; issue .
is r.l. stine here , &apos; cause you just gave me goosebumps ?
oh , good one , boss .
congratulations .
you just sold your book for a million dollars .
gentlemen ,
&quot; to the troll twins of underbridge academy . &quot;
yeah !
so , does this square us
for kansas city ?
square as golden books , pop .
what happened to me ?
in one vulnerable moment ,
i became t thing i hated most-- a literary fraud .
but lis , when this book comes out , you &apos;ll be beloved .
not just by milhouses .
you &apos;ll get attention from jacksons , xanders ,
even aidens .
aw , i &apos;ve always wanted an aiden .
here it is , an advance copy .
&quot; the vampire twins of transylvania prep &quot; ? !
where &apos;s the trolls ?
the trolls are now vampires ,
the brooklyn bridge is now a castle ,
and fuzzlepitch is now bloodball .
oh , weak ! weak and lame !
how could the publishers change our book ?
if they had been in charge of the sistine chapel ,
the whole thing would be vampires ,
instead of the pope &apos;s private naked dude mural .
look , we market @-@ tested the book ,
and it really got dinged on the whole trolls thing .
i mean dinged .
so we made some changes . don &apos;t feel bad .
before we got our hands on twilight ,
it was about a girl who fell in love with a golem .
but teenagers weren &apos;t going to spend their allowances
to join team schmul .
but the trolls were the best part !
do the characters still say
&quot; trolly &quot; instead of &quot; cool &quot; ?
no .
oh , that is so untrolly !
hey , if you don &apos;t want your words changed ,
write a screenplay .
we own your book , so why don &apos;t you go and cry
into your million @-@ dollar check ?
how could they do this to our book ?
it was the singular vision of seven people .
no way !
what you &apos;re feeling is called
pride of authorship .
you thought you only cared about money ,
but you actually care more about what you &apos;ve created together .
british fonzie is right .
our story is actually more important than money .
i was gonna buy the apartment next door
and fill it with dolls , but now that just sounds stupid .
they can &apos;t do this to us . we &apos;ve got to fight back !
yeah , let &apos;s get &apos; em !
oh , yeah !
he &apos;s right .
we got to fight ...
rule number one of book heists--
never fall in love with the book .
we queer the deal , we lose the money .
bart , remember the thousand @-@ year war
between the trolls and the ogres ?
yeah ?
now it &apos;s a dance contest at the vampire prom .
let &apos;s steal back our book .
somewhere in that building is a computer
with their sucky version of our masterpiece .
the book prints at midnight ,
so if we swap in the original version ,
they &apos;ll print the wrong book-- our book .
and before the publishers can do anything about it ,
the troll twins of underbridge academy
will be in every bookstore in america !
this is the fuzzlepitch finals ,
and tonight , we drink from the wazzle cup !
hello . i &apos;m the pizza delivery man .
we didn &apos;t order a pizza .
no , of course you didn &apos;t .
the establishment i work for delivers pizzas to everyone ,
and then gives the customer the option
of accepting or refusing delivery .
that &apos;s a terrible business strategy .
no , no , it &apos;s quite sound .
okay , fine .
where &apos;s the pizza ?
pizza ?
the central computer &apos;s through here .
all we have to do is upload our file and ...
good evening , gentlemen .
kansas city .
kansas city .
so , you thought you would un @-@ ruin your book .
if it &apos;s any consolation ,
you never had a chance .
whoo @-@ hoo ! all right !
someone in your gang
tipped me off to your little caper .
a traitor ?
i bet it &apos;s the earl of marmalade over here .
no , guys . it was me .
oh , betrayal !
it can &apos;t be !
it &apos;s always a dame .
but why ?
because a little girl wants her dream to come true .
my name is finally on a book !
and they &apos;re letting me write the sequel !
a hard deadline is just the kick in the pants i need
to focus and get some serious writing done .
now to enter the password and to authorize final publication .
my favorite theme of a wall calendar .
lisa , would you care to do the honors ?
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , by the way , the audio book is only available ... abridged .
abridged !
well , we may have lost , but we gave the bad guy a laugh .
that &apos;s something .
our book ! the real one !
yes !
wonderful words !
no need to thank me , boys .
you wouldn &apos;t say that unless there was a need to thank you .
you could never have printed your version of the book
without the publisher &apos;s password ,
so i pretended to betray you .
then after he typed the password ,
i secretly switched the flash drives .
you switched the drives ?
i got the idea from every movie ever made .
and the best part is ,
my face is still on the back flap .
gaiman !
poor lisa . did it never occur to her that there might be
three flash drives ?
i &apos;ve heisted my way to the bestseller list once again .
and the most brilliant part is ,
i don &apos;t even know how to read .
gaiman , i &apos;ve been waiting to do this for a long time .
congratulations , partner .
we did it .
hey , neil , how come you watched me drink mine ,
but you didn &apos;t drink yours ?
it &apos;s simple , moe .
i don &apos;t like the taste ... of poison .
ah ... crap .
