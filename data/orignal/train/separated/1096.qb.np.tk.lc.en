we &apos;re not done here !
keep pushing .
told you it would sink .
are you currently seeing ezra fitz ?
no , i &apos;m not .
this might be bigger than mona , okay ?
she could be working for someone .
why didn &apos;t you tell me this ?
&apos;cause i was being protective .
are you immediate family ?
um , no .
then you need to wait outside .
those bitches are finally going to get what they deserve .
and you let me believe that you were dead ?
so i could protect you .
there never was a happy ending for us .
bye , ezra .
those bitches are going to be at the lodge at nine .
do you understand ?
you have no idea what &apos;s going on here .
ali ?
did anyone see her ?
see who ?
alison .
is that ... somebody pulled it out of the lake .
get out of my way !
we have to get this out of here .
you &apos;re mine now .
kisses ... &quot; a. &quot;
what the ...

this was all her . she set us up .
okay , let &apos;s go . let &apos;s get out of here .

come on !
mona , come on . we have to go .
mona !
hurry up !
got it .
come on !
there &apos;s a report on the lodge , but nothing about wilden &apos;s car .
well , i guess the fire trumps a dead pig .
you can stop staring out the window , aria .
the cops aren &apos;t coming to arrest us .
i &apos;m supposed to feel safe just because you say it &apos;s all okay now ?
after everything you &apos;ve put us through .
do you think we &apos;d be sitting here if anyone saw us ?
wanna know what i think ?
i think you &apos;re lucky that we &apos;re not beating the crap out of you .
and i believe you could , emily .
you really were the weakest link .
but look how strong i made you . you should be thanking me .
okay , that &apos;s it .
em
you know we all want to take a turn .
but we won &apos;t .
you like games , right , mona ?
so , let &apos;s play one called the third degree .
how did you get the car out of the lake ?
i didn &apos;t .
i put the car in hanna &apos;s garage ,
and that was the last time i saw it .
shana knew jenna before she came to rosewood .
i think she &apos;s in love with her .
they &apos;re both afraid of melissa .
when cece came to radley , i thought she was ali .
i don &apos;t remember what we talked about .
it was before they changed my meds .
lucas gave emily that massage .
he said you were tense .
i recruited toby when he got that job in bucks county .
i didn &apos;t push ian off the bell tower .
i wish i knew who did .
mona &apos;s gone !
i don &apos;t remember falling asleep .
did she drug us ?
wouldn &apos;t be the first time .
you guys , she still has that chip .
oh , emily , i borrowed your car .
yeah , i have my own set .
where &apos;d you go ?
coffee run .
where else did you go ?
americano , one pink .
dry soy cap .
super @-@ sized drip , with three sugars .
and a skinny vanilla for you .
did i get it right ?
i want the chip , mona . and i want it now .
and i also got breakfast .
multigrain scone .
i &apos;m not in the mood to play room service .
i wish i could give it to you , hanna . but i can &apos;t .
why not ?
i need to find out who red coat is and so do you .
she tried to kill all of us ,
so , like it or not , we are in this together .
okay , prove it .
yeah , we want everything you &apos;ve have on us .
now .
mi casa es su casa .
in english .
she &apos;s taking us to her lair .
all this for a muddy cop car and a dead pig ?
it &apos;s wilden .
第四季 第一集
oh , my god .
&quot; you &apos;re mine now . &quot;
i know what the text meant .
&quot; a &quot; has a way to make it look like we killed him .
if red coat &apos;s &quot; a , &quot;
why did she save us from the fire ?
so she could set us up to take the fall for wilden &apos;s murder .
a cat plays with a mouse for hours before she actually eats it .
once it &apos;s dead , the fun &apos;s over .
so we &apos;re ali &apos;s mice ?
we &apos;re her dolls .
guys , alison isn &apos;t playing with us , okay ?
she &apos;s dead .
you were on the halloween train . dressed like caleb .
to think we were this close to our first kiss .
and to getting rid of me for good .
that wasn &apos;t me .
and i can prove it .
when i took this , you were already in the box .
and these two put you in there .
it &apos;s not gonna happen !
that &apos;s wilden .
listen to me .
he was the queen of hearts ?
just leave her . plans have changed .
garrett &apos;s going to tell them everything .
there &apos;s two of them ?
we can &apos;t let that happen .
who &apos;s that ?
your sister .
oh , yeah , that &apos;s convenient . right before you could prove it .
wait , mona , what &apos;s going on ?
someone &apos;s deleting all my files !
mona , shut it down !
i &apos;m trying to .
alison .
come out , come out , wherever you are .
it &apos;s not fair , aria . it was emily &apos;s idea .
hey , there !
where did you get these dolls ?
they were a present . mine &apos;s name is aria .
and that &apos;s hanna , spencer , emily , and mona .
who gave them to you ?
your friend , alison .
she started playing with us right after you moved in .
yeah , whatever you need .
all right , i &apos;ll be there .
see you tonight .
was that caleb ? is he back ?
no .
it was mona .
what exactly is it that she needs ?
she just wants to move the rv
until we can all get rid of it together .
i &apos;m driving her there .
i was thinking about last night ,
and mona put her gloves on before she touched wilden &apos;s car .
meanwhile , our prints are all over it .
she &apos;s like hannibal lector smart .
精神分析师 连环杀人魔
she &apos;s been doing this for a long time .
who &apos;s to say that she &apos;s not still doing it ?
you &apos;re right . but if i &apos;ve learned from my mom ,
it &apos;s keep your friends close and your enemies closer .
so , you &apos;re going to be her new bff ?
if that &apos;s what it takes to get that chip .
hey , i thought you were at work .
nobody &apos;s getting anything done today .
all anyone can think about is poor wilden .
do they know who did it ?
no , but there are witnesses .
i &apos;m not sure exactly what they saw , but ...
you doing okay , hanna ?
i &apos;m sorry i had to leave so early this morning .
we really didn &apos;t get a chance to talk .
who &apos;s that for ?
jessica dilaurentis .
she stopped by the police station this morning .
she &apos;s moving back .
wait , back to their old house ?
yeah .
jason made it seem like she hated it here .
he said that she couldn &apos;t face all the memories of alison .
well , something must have changed .
i mean , in spite of what &apos;s been going on with wilden ,
she seems to be in a pretty good place .
that &apos;s probably your dad .
maybe mrs. d isn &apos;t so sad anymore
because she knows what we know .
we don &apos;t know anything , hanna .
i saw who pulled us out of the fire , em . it was alison .
so ...
he threw it on this pile .
i &apos;m sure of it .
you think they left anything inside ?
hey , it &apos;s not safe to go in there .
spencer ?
spence ?
what ?
we shouldn &apos;t be in here .
well , we are . so , we might as well look .
and what are we looking for ?
red coat .
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s in here .
what if it was ali ?
and what if she brought us here because ...
she &apos;s ready to come home .
she pulls everybody out and then takes off ?
because she knows it isn &apos;t safe ?
it &apos;s possible .
well , if you &apos;re not taking into account that she died two years ago .
sure , it &apos;s possible .
toby ?
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re in here alone .
emily ?
it feels like home when you see a friendly face .
uh , this is for you . it &apos;s from my mom .
tell her i said thank you
and i look forward to having her over for tea
as soon as i &apos;m settled in .
i will .
is jason back , too ?
he &apos;s down south . renovating grandma d &apos;s place .
it &apos;s a beautiful house , but she let things go .
and it smells like old people .
ali hated that smell .
it &apos;s good to hear someone say her name .
people avoid it . they &apos;re trying to be polite .
but it &apos;s not nice . it &apos;s weak .
no , no , no . that &apos;s fragile . i &apos;ll move those .
emily , would you mind helping with these ?
sure .
can you set that on the bed ?
you kept all of her things ?
i think that &apos;s what she would have wanted .
she &apos;s building a shrine to ali .
or ali wants her old room back .
i know how real it feels when you think you see her .
maybe that &apos;s just because none of us want to let go of her .
imagine how mrs. d. must feel .
i think we &apos;re here .
where &apos;s here ?
some creepy farm in the middle of nowhere .
okay . be careful , okay ?
if i &apos;m not back by midnight , send a search party .
thanks for helping me .
we &apos;re in this together now , right ?
kind of like old times .
that should do it .
are you sure it &apos;s safe in here ?
yeah . i mean , it &apos;ll be fine for a few days .
you know , there &apos;s stuff in there that can bring us all down .
what ?
i just haven &apos;t thought about
you and me as an &quot; us &quot; for a long time .
well , anyway ...
hi , i &apos;ll get a cappuccino , please .
aria ?
you know , i could pretend like i didn &apos;t see you ,
but i don &apos;t want to lie .
this is new territory for us . what--what do i do ?
do i say &quot; hi &quot; to you ? do i avoid you ?
well , i &apos;m saying &quot; hi . &quot;
we probably shouldn &apos;t have a coffee together though , right ?
yeah , yesterday i might have said that that would be okay .
why not tonight ?
i got offered a permanent job .
oh , that &apos;s great .
i haven &apos;t said yes yet because it &apos;s at rosewood .
ezra , you know it &apos;s a lot easier
to not see you when i &apos;m actually not seeing you .
i really need this .
i have a family now .
i know . i understand .
and if you want to see other people ...
sometimes that &apos;s the best way to move on .
i &apos;m not ready for that .
bye , mr. fitz .
he was shot multiple times .
and the place that he was killed was a different location
than where the body was found .
says that time of death ... thank you ...
was between ten and midnight .
which is when we were at the lodge .
so , we can &apos;t use that as an alibi .
eat .
and &quot; a &quot; knows that they &apos;re going to
figure out that fire was arson .
and who would believe that we were there and we didn &apos;t start it ?
you see this ? it &apos;s a fork .
you can use it to eat the breakfast
your boyfriend just cooked for you .
i love the way that sounds .
you calling yourself my boyfriend .
eat .
i am .
this is perfect .
not just the food . you being here .
is there any more coffee ?
it goes against my better judgment .
but this is your last cup , okay ?
promise .
all right .
so , what does &quot; a &quot; have on us ?
going through withdrawals over here .
tobes ?
hey , is everything okay ?
yeah , yeah , yeah . it was just a lead on a new job .
thank you for breakfast ...
boyfriend .
paige doesn &apos;t know about wilden yet .
not sure how much to tell her .
aria ?
do you believe in that four seasons of grief theory ?
that you have to live through a year of everything ,
before you can really get over someone .
you guys have survived so much .
can &apos;t you just wait it out for a few months ?
just feels like we &apos;re back where we started .
and we can &apos;t go back to where we were .
there &apos;s too much at stake now .
you know i totally support you and ezra together ,
but maybe he &apos;s right .
you know , it &apos;s senior year . you should be having some fun .
look at him .
they &apos;re hanging on his every word .
you &apos;ve never been on one ,
but there &apos;s this thing called a double date .
and it &apos;s what you do with your friends
when you can actually be seen in public
with the person you &apos;re going out with .
oh , my god . i am so busted .
hackett just saw me staring at ezra .
now he &apos;s walking over here .
i think that what mr . fitz meant was steinbeck used
the farmer as a metaphor for his frustration .
is he gone ?
no . and he &apos;s totally watching you .
let &apos;s just meet at your house after school .
do you have a minute ?
yeah , sure .
you look tired .
well , i only slept for like twelve minutes last night .
every time i closed my eyes i saw wilden .
and then i saw a pig , and then i saw wilden with a pig face .
la bride surlecou .
look , i don &apos;t think we &apos;re waiting for this &quot; a &apos;s &quot; shoe to drop .
i feel like we &apos;re waiting for it to stomp on us .
careful , hanna .
when you use words like &quot; us &quot; and &quot; we , &quot; my mind goes to
this place where i think we could
actually be friends again .
do you remember when my dad left ?
i did not want to get out of bed ,
but you forced me to go to every sale that summer at the mall .
yeah .
i miss my shopportunist friend .
look , i have a french study group after school ,
but i can cancel , if you want to hit macys .
i don &apos;t just want it . i need it .
c &apos;est un rendez @-@ vous . it &apos;s a date .
coco chanel .
aria montgomery ,
report to the vice principal &apos;s office .
aria montgomery , please report to the vice principal &apos;s office .
i gave you a chance to be honest with me .
and you chose to lie .
i &apos;m not sure what you mean .
i know you &apos;re sleeping with your teacher .
i wanted to believe you .
but after receiving an anonymous correspondence
from a concerned student--
well , i told you that mr. fitz and i had seen each other
after he left rosewood high--
only occasionally , but broke it off before it became serious .
we &apos;ve called your parents . they &apos;re on their way .
yes .
i &apos;m relieved to know he &apos;s in custody . thank you .
you &apos;re arresting him ?
in this state , it &apos;s a felony
for a teacher to have sex with a minor .
ezra fitz is going to prison .
miss montgomery !
sorry to keep you waiting .
uh , your mom suggested
i have you bring these home for her to sign .
sure , i &apos;ll take care of it .
and tell her i hope she &apos;s feeling better .
it looks incredible .
but it &apos;s just so far away .
that &apos;s what i love about it .
it &apos;s got one of the best swim programs in the country .
i thought you &apos;d be excited .
oh , it &apos;s an amazing opportunity .
you have to take it . you have to say yes .
it &apos;s an amazing opportunity for us , emily .
i want you to come with me .
to stanford ?
they offered me a full ride .
and you &apos;re as good as i am .
if they want me , they &apos;ll want you , too .
i just thought i was always going to go to danby .
danby &apos;s great .
but you and me in california .
think about it .
except for hawaii , you can &apos;t find a college that &apos;s further away
from rosewood , further away from &quot; a. &quot;
we &apos;ll live together ,
and you can decorate the place however you want .
we &apos;ll study on the beach .
spend weekends in san francisco .
and how much fun would it be to drive across country ?
you , me , donuts and diners .
we can start over out there .
don &apos;t you want to live where you &apos;re not afraid of the dark ?
in a place where i don &apos;t always have to be afraid for you ?
yes .
yes ?
i want to go .
i want to be with you .
oh , yes !
i really love you .
oh , come here .
i love you , too .
want me to help you take everything upstairs ?
um , no . i &apos;ll just put it away later .
you sure ? i don &apos;t mind .
how about a soda ?
sure .
so , when caleb comes back you
should surprise him with that lace camisole .
maybe with that sheer donna karan barely buttoned .
good idea .
has he found his dad ?
um , he was heading to his aunt &apos;s cabin .
and they really don &apos;t have good cell service there , so ...
i haven &apos;t heard from him .
maybe he got lucky .
yeah .
so , how &apos; bout you ?
who are you wearing that blue strapless for ?
well , since noel , there hasn &apos;t been anybody .
so , i bought it for me .
that &apos;s a healthy attitude .
yeah .
thanks .
i should actually probably get going .
i had fun today .
no , you didn &apos;t .
i know you &apos;re just pretending to be my friend again .
it &apos;s the only copy .
if i were you , i &apos;d burn it .
you &apos;re giving it to me ?
just like that ?
yeah .
i really loved you once .
and i really was your friend .
i had a really great night .
me too .
drive safe .
thanks .
you two make a cute couple .
did you slither on down here to comment on my love life ?
i need a favor .
yeah , wrong address .
you probably didn &apos;t know that darren was a friend of mine .
we met right after i moved to town .
can &apos;t believe he &apos;s dead .
sorry for your loss .
if anything happens to me ,
can you give toby a message ?
what would happen to you ?
seems to me like you &apos;re indestructible .
well , it seems to me that everyone who saw ali
the night she went missing is waking up dead .
wilden saw ali that night ?
that &apos;s what garrett told me .
did you burn yourself ?
toby isn &apos;t answering my calls ,
and i know that you &apos;re still friends .
tell him i never meant to hurt him .
it feels like the entire town of rosewood
has come together to mourn the loss
of detective darren wilden ,
one of rosewood &apos;s most high @-@ profile police officers .
do you really think &quot; a &quot; put something in there ?
with his rotting , stinking corpse .
since there &apos;s a viewing ,
you can assume that he &apos;s been embalmed .
and that would suspend decomposition
and prevent the mourners from having to deal
with the rotting and eventual putrescence of the corpse .
okay , what the hell did she just say ?
who is that ?
guys , &quot; closed caskets keep secrets .
his is open and exposes yours . &quot;
there &apos;s something in that coffin that &apos;s incriminating to us .
are you really so sure about everything
you &apos;re so sure about ?
yes . and in about thirty minutes ,
they &apos;re going to open the casket for viewing ,
people are going to walk past to say goodbye to wilden .
whatever &quot; a &quot; has on us--
okay , we didn &apos;t kill wilden . so what could it be ?
besides another set @-@ up .
yeah , em &apos;s right . we shouldn &apos;t even be here .
if we get busted for poking around that casket--
i don &apos;t think we have a choice . we have to look .
i mean , at my grandma &apos;s funeral , they kept the casket
in a private room until the service started .
let &apos;s just go find it .
aria was right .
the casket isn &apos;t here yet .
okay , so let &apos;s split up .
and if you find it , send out an s.o.s.
looks like we got the same &quot; a &quot; message .
blocked .
kisses ?
redial ?
i &apos;m not leaving here until you do .
hello ?
hanna ?
why are you calling me on my mom &apos;s phone ?
how did &quot; a &quot; get this ?
you &apos;re sure it &apos;s her &apos;s ?
if anything happens to my mom ...
when was the last time you talked to her ?
this morning . she called me from the hotel .
that &apos;s good . that means she &apos;s okay .
hanna , there &apos;s no way we &apos;re letting &quot; a &quot; bring down mrs. m.
so , is that what this means ?
my mom &apos;s &quot; a &apos;s &quot; target ?
you girls all look so pretty .
hi , mrs. dilaurentis .
ali would be so proud of you , hanna .
you &apos;ve really kept the weight off .
thank you .
why don &apos;t you girls come and sit next to me ?
who is that ?
the lord is my shepard ,
i shall not want .
so , these are your toys ?
you don &apos;t play with them .
i know you want to kiss me .
you &apos;re home already ?
mom .
it &apos;s four o &apos;clock .
are you okay ?
i--i &apos;m just a little tired .
no , you &apos;re not just a little tired , mom .
i think something &apos;s going on with you .
i &apos;ll make you a snack .
did she just wake up ?
i think there &apos;s something wrong with her .
it &apos;s called &quot; lazy much &quot; ?
i want you to leave .
seriously ?
yes .
loser .
who is that ?
emily , spencer , aria , and hanna ?
yes ?
i &apos;m officer holbrook . pennsylvania state police .
my partner and i are investigating the murders
of officer reynolds and detective wilden .
we already spoke to the police when garrett was killed .
i read that in the report .
i &apos;ve actually been reading a lot about you four .
wilden had a thing for you .
he had a nasty habit of harassing us .
i &apos;ve read through most of his notes and i agree with you .
his conduct borders on unprofessional at best .
thank you .
so why did you come to his funeral ?
we &apos;re , uh , supporting our local police department .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s appreciated .
we &apos;ll probably have to bring you in for questioning .
but remember , we &apos;re the good guys .
just here to find out the truth .
&quot; truth won &apos;t set you free , bitches . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m going to bury you with it . &quot;
&quot; kisses , a. &quot;
oh , my god .
&quot; a &quot; was there that night ?
she recorded the whole thing .
