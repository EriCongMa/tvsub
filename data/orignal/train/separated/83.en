I'm sorry, do you need that hot sauce?
Thank you, thank you.
I do that, too.
But with the accordion.
It's classical piano, huh?
With me, I can play "Old Grey Mare," that's just about it.
I'm sorry if I'm being nosy.
Are you Eli Gold?
Um, Eli Gold?
Yes.
I knew it.
I saw you sitting there.
I thought to myself,
"That's Eli Gold, the campaign manager."
I didn't want to say anything in case I was wrong.
How's the campaign going?
Good.
Well, I am gonna vote for your guy.
I sure will.
Thank you.
Nice meeting you.
You used to have Wooster-Graff Industries as a client, didn't you?
Back when you were a crisis manager?
Last year sometime?
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I being nosy again?
What do you need, Mr...?
LaGuardia.
David is good, though.
I work for the Justice Department
when I'm not practicing the accordion, so I was just...
Oh, you gotta go?
Look, I'm sorry.
I just wanted to talk to you about a few things. Maybe...
Get me Leshoure from Wooster-Graff Industries.
Greg Leshoure on two.
Tell him I'll call him back.
Nora, I need your phone.
It's my mom.
Call her back!
Mom, I have to call you back.
Come on!
Diane Lockhart.
This is a simple case.
On that, I agree with my respected colleague
for the prosecution.
Nine months ago,
a young woman named Brandi Colavito
attended Alt-O-Rama,
three-day music festival here in Chicago.
While there, she was murdered.
The killer then took the body
50 miles south to her hometown,
in Minooka, in Grundy County,
and dumped her.
Now ASA Hellinger has seen fit to charge my client,
Troy Mallick,
a respected executive with a spotless record.
This despite the fact that he had no motive
and there were better suspects in Minooka.
So let's look at the evidence.
Her name was Brandi Colavito.
She lived here in Minooka,
went to Minooka Community High, graduated,
and moved away to Chicago where she was murdered
after a rock concert.
You will hear evidence that my client,
Gary Kuharski, killed her.
He didn't.
You will hear evidence that he was obsessed with Brandi,
that he stalked her after she broke up with him.
He wasn't.
You will hear evidence
that he followed her to the Chicago concert.
That is untrue.
But what ASA Hellinger won't tell you
is that Brandi had an ex-boyfriend,
a young man living in her hometown,
who became obsessed with her, who stalked her.
Now, you might ask the prosecutor,
why this is being prosecuted here at all?
The murder didn't take place in Minooka.
It took place in Chicago.
Yes, the body was transported here,
but this is big-city business.
Not our business.
I'll tell you why Gary's being prosecuted here.
Because Cook County didn't think
there was enough evidence to charge him.
Objection, Your Honor.
Yes, Ms. Hoff, let's not theorize
on why someone did or did not do something.
And another thing Ms. Hellinger won't tell you,
not only is my client innocent,
but there is someone in another county ...
Objection, Your Honor!
...being tried for this exact same crime!
Someone from Minooka...
Your Honor, this is outrageous!
Yes, outrage is thick in the air. Approach.
I'm not sure what the problem is here, Your Honor.
You gave Mr. Gardner specific and explicit instructions
Which I followed. Which I followed to a T.
Not to bring up...
Mr. Gardner,
I know you like playing the bad boy.
Do it on your own time, not on mine.
Your Honor, you warned me not to bring up
the name of the man being tried in Minooka.
And I have not, even though this is
a gross miscarriage of justice.
Has there ever been a mere miscarriage of justice?
Why is it always a gross one?
You were warned not to bring up
the other trial at all, Mr. Gardner.
They're mentioning our trial there, Your Honor.
Yes, and if the judge in Minooka wants
to allow that, that's his prerogative.
He wants a mistrial, Your Honor.
Mr. Gardner has delayed this court date for months,
hoping the other trial would result in a guilty verdict.
I would have to agree.
You're not getting a mistrial, Mr. Gardner,
and I will hold you in contempt and fine you $10,000.
And your next offense?
You will find yourself in a jail cell.
And if this Minooka trial results in a guilty verdict,
Your Honor?
If another person is found guilty of this murder,
yes, then you may present that evidence to the jury,
but not before.
Do you understand?
I do, Your Honor.
All right, then step back.
And, Mr. Gardner, behave.
How are you enjoying the big leagues?
Is that what this is?
Seemed pretty bush league to me.
Mr. State's Attorney?
I'm Alicia Florrick--
I left a message with your office.
Yes, and the answer is no.
The answer? I haven't even asked the question yet.
You want to help me, right?
If I get a guilty verdict for him,
your guy in Chicago goes free.
Well, that's the hope.
I don't like defense attorneys, ma'am.
I don't trust them.
Mr. State's Attorney,
we have access to the Cook County Medical Examiner's files.
We have an outside forensic analysis...
Good day, ma'am.
Hi. He doesn't want our help.
He will.
Kalinda is getting a soil sample tonight.
Do a search on a type of soil called clay loam.
Oh. Um, I'll write up a brief on it.
How's Troy doing?
Not good. Deer in the headlights.
I wish you were here to hand-hold him.
Oh, you're not bad at that yourself.
Thanks, but I'm not so sure.
Drive safe.
Okay.
Alicia said to say hi. You all right?
My parents think the jury doesn't like me.
One thing I know is you can't read a jury.
You can't let 'em get into your head.
You just gotta play it cool
and let them know that you're innocent.
I was approached today by a DOJ agent
named David LaGuardia.
Approached?
In what way approached?
An off-the-record drop-by over lunch.
What did he say?
He mentioned Wooster-Graff Industries.
I managed the bad publicity
around their IPO last year.
But I left before he said anything more.
Good. Did something happen at Wooster-Graff
that I should know about?
Completely aboveboard. Completely legal.
Then they're just fishing.
I wouldn't worry about it.
He gave you this?
No.
Where did you get this?
I can't say.
I had the floor checked.
It's empty. A bankruptcy.
When was this?
I don't know. A year ago, maybe.
I moved that painting a bit.
Do you want me to go to Justice?
I am in the middle of a campaign, Diane.
The rumor of an investigation is often worse than a result.
I need you, if you don't mind, to keep this confidential.
Of course.
No, I mean, from the candidate.
You mean, don't put Alicia on it?
Or Will.
Can I use the computer, Mom?
For homework?
Yes.
In a minute. I'm almost done.
Don't worry, Mom, I got it.
Mom?
Uh, yeah, good. Okay.
Tom Szabo.
I work as evidence technician for Grundy County.
And you collected evidence at two sites, Mr. Szabo:
locally, where the body was found,
and also at the murder site.
Yes, I received permission
from Cook County to observe their collection there.
And what did you find that was identical at both sites?
A shoe impression.
This one?
Yes, the one on the right is from the murder scene,
and the one on the left is from the body site.
And did you find a match for this shoe impression?
Yes, sir. In Mr. Kuharski's closet.
They were size 11 Saturn running shoes.
Thank you, sir. Nothing further.
Mr. Szabo,
you say you compared the shoe impression
to my client's sneakers,
but did you also compare it to Troy Mallick's sneakers?
Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.
You've already ruled this parallel Chicago trial
relevant, Your Honor.
If the shoe impression matches the Chicago defendant,
that's highly relevant.
Yep, Alma, that's right.
Sorry, Lee, I will overrule.
I did not compare the impression.
But the Illinois Crime Lab did.
Mr. Szabo, can you read what it says in their determination?
"Based upon a comparison
of the shoe impressions with the size 11 footwear
worn by Troy Mallick,
we determine a match."
So, you think the shoe impression matches my client's shoes,
but the Chicago team thinks
it matches Troy Mallick's shoes.
Which one do you suppose it is?
Objection!
Thank you. Nothing further.
You're losing. You need that.
Mr. Szabo, as a forensic evidence technician,
did you perform an analysis of the soil
from Mr. Kuharski's sneakers?
Yes, but unfortunately,
I didn't have a sample
from the murder site to compare it to.
Because the lab in Chicago failed to release one to you?
That's right. There was a bit of a jurisdictional dispute.
I understand.
Prosecution Exhibit D, Your Honor.
This is an analysis of the soil from the murder site.
Objection. This is not on the prosecution's exhibit list.
We've just become aware of it.
Because Mr. Tripke was handed it
by someone in the gallery.
Yes, I think I recognize our illustrious guest.
We've had dealings before, haven't we, Ms...?
Mrs. Florrick.
Ah, yes.
And you're providing evidence to our state's attorney?
A soil analysis from the crime scene.
There's nothing prohibiting that.
That is certainly true.
Unorthodox, but not prohibited.
I'll allow, subject to verification.
Thank you, Your Honor.
So, Mr. Szabo, this analysis shows
that the soil from Alt-O-Rama, from the murder site,
was called Drummer silt clay loam.
Yes, according to this analysis.
And that's a very unique soil type.
It is.
And could you tell me
what type of soil was found in the tread
of the defendant's shoe?
Drummer silt clay loam.
And didn't the defendant say he was never at the concert?
Objection. Beyond the scope.
Withdrawn.
Anything else you have, I'm open.
I'm done with the desktop
if you need the hard line.
The Wi-Fi's working now. Thanks.
What did I do?
Nothing.
The dent was already there.
Zach, I'm...
What dent?
The dent on the car.
It was already there.
Someone must have opened their door and hit it.
Okay. Um, that's not why I'm here.
I-I was just, um,
wondering how you are.
Good.
Good.
And Nisa?
You're still dating?
Yeah.
How old is she now?
Nisa? 15.
I thought you liked Nisa.
No, I do.
Um, I'm just wondering...
do we need to have a conversation?
About?
Sex.
Uh, Mom, no.
No, I'm fine, really.
Well, we agreed that if there was ever anything
you needed to talk about...
Yeah, and there's not. Really, I'm good.
And we already did talk about that.
I... I did a search on my computer,
and when I typed in the question,
it said that the previous search
was for types of condoms.
And you thought it was me
that searched for types of condoms?
Well, I mean, you use the hard line.
So does Grace.
Grace?
Yeah.
And she's seeing Connor now.
She's seeing him?
Yes, and I would never hunt on your computer.
And if I did, I know how to scrub a search cache clean.
Okay, thanks.
Let's not rub your sophistication in my face, please.
Mrs. Florrick?
Nick Saverese is waiting for you in the conference room.
Do you know why?
No. He didn't seem happy.
I don't want Cary on my case.
You don't want Cary? Why?
I want you or one of the other partners.
Well, I'm working on something full-time at the moment.
Is there a specific problem?
Yeah, he accused me of running drugs.
He...
How did he do that?
Well, he came to my lot and he said, as my lawyer
and as a friend of the state's attorney's office,
he knew what I was doing,
using the cars we towed to move drugs.
Would you give me a minute?
Mr. Saverese, I talked to the partners
and we must apologize,
but we can't represent you anymore.
Really? Why?
It's not to our benefit.
Okay.
You know, the last time it weren't to your benefit,
the partners took me back.
They sent me an apology with a gift basket.
Yes, but that was when you had a $25 million governmental bid.
You lost that some time ago,
and it doesn't look like you're getting it back.
You didn't talk to the partners.
You talked to Cary.
I'm sorry, Mr. Saverese, we have to let you go.
I know you're the wife of the state's attorney.
You don't want to say anything to anyone
about this drug charge.
Ever.
Attorney client privilege and all that.
Here's the thing, Mr. Saverese,
attorney client privilege is voided
if I'm threatened.
So let me ask you this,
and I suggest you take a moment before answering.
Are you threatening me?
You decide.
Brandt Claussen, OLS Security.
We are first and we are fast.
And on the night in question,
were you working security for Alt-O-Rama?
I was.
And you tell us...
No, strike that.
Did you see the defendant
with the victim, Brandi Colavito?
Yes. I saw them fighting,
yelling at each other.
And afterwards?
Well, he basically followed her into the woods,
where the concertgoers camp and I
and I heard her screaming.
You heard Brandi screaming. What was she screaming?
Objection, hearsay.
Res gestae exception, Your Honor.
Overruled. You may answer.
"Get away from me. Stop it."
And then it just suddenly stopped, her screaming.
So then I basically ran into the woods
to see what happened,
and I couldn't find her at first.
But then I found the bloody clothing.
No sign of Troy?
No. I guess I got there too late.
He must have taken the body.
Objection, Your Honor. Speculation.
Sustained. Mr. Gardner, I've concluded my questioning.
Thank you, ASA Hellinger.
So, Mr. Claussen,
you heard Brandi screaming, "Get away from me. Stop it."
And how far away were you at this time, approximately.
From the screaming?
I guess about 80 yards.
And you heard it clearly?
Yes. It was awful.
And what are these?
Earplugs.
And you're provided these by the stadium
because of the loud music to keep you from going deaf?
Yes.
Were you wearing them that night?
Was that a yes?
Yes.
Could you put them in? I'd like to try something.
Objection, Your Honor.
Must we have the dramatics?
Well, the witness has sworn to hearing the screaming.
I just want to see if he could.
A little drama never hurt anyone, Ms. Hellinger.
Please put them in.
Now I'm gonna ask my associate to step out into the hall.
That's not exactly 80 yards.
It's probably 30.
Can you just tell us what you hear, Mr. Claussen.
I'm sorry. Just tell us what you hear.
I'm not being murdered!
I'm just screaming in the hallway!
Cute.
Thanks. Offer a plea bargain.
Why?
I hear it's going very well in Minooka.
They find their guy guilty,
your case evaporates.
Yes, and if their guy confessed,
my case would evaporate, too, but it's not gonna happen.
Matan.
I think I need your help.
Hey, I thought you were heading up to Minooka.
I am.
I'm late.
What's wrong?
Should I be afraid of your husband?
No.
Why?
He was here.
When?
This morning.
I told him we were no longer representing him.
He didn't take it very well.
He's worried that
Cary and I might tell someone that he's moving drugs.
Did I do the right thing?
Telling him we no longer represent him?
And I'm not in danger?
No.
You won't be.
Good.
Captain Tim Resnick,
Chief of Investigations at the Minooka Police Department.
And did you have any official contact with Mr. Kuharski
prior to arresting him for murder?
Yes, three months ago,
I was called to the scene of a domestic dispute.
Mr. Kuharski had beaten Brandi around the face and neck.
Did you arrest him at that time?
We did.
But he posted bail,
and Brandi declined to press charges.
And was this the last time
you found the two in such a situation?
No, Brandi eventually obtained a restraining order against him.
Thank you, Detective.
Your witness.
They're getting help from Cook County--
that man is an ASA.
Alma, you have something there?
Uh, yes, Your Honor. We do.
Detective Resnick,
when did you first turn to my client as a suspect?
When did I?
Probably after I saw the murder scene evidence
from the Chicago police.
Hmm, not before?
You didn't have any foregone conclusions before?
No, always keep an open mind.
Odd, because I have here the notes
from a Detective Collier of the Chicago police.
Objection, Your Honor.
That is not on the exhibit list.
Yes, we just became aware of it.
Yeah, we seem to have a very odd situation here.
A Chicago defense attorney helping our prosecutor
and a... I'm sorry.
Would you like to introduce yourself, sir?
Matan Brody, Your Honor,
Cook County ASA.
Just call me Murph.
A Chicago defense attorney helping our prosecutor.
A Chicago prosecutor helping our defense.
I thought I'd seen it all.
Your objection is overruled, Lee.
Please proceed, Ms. Hoff.
I'm aglow with anticipation.
As I was saying,
I have the Chicago detective's notes here.
Perhaps you could read from the highlighted portion.
"Received a call from Detective Resnick in Minooka."
Strongly believes killer is ex-boyfriend."
Yeah.
Sounds like prejudging to me.
Objection, Your Honor.
Sustained.
What?
Matan is here, helping the defense.
You're kidding.
Having some trouble out there in Minooka?
I'll call you back.
I wonder what the taxpayers would say
about you helping the defense
in another county get a murderer off.
Probably the same thing your creditors would say about
you sending the state's attorney's wife.
Whoever loses buys the other drinks.
You're gonna lose.
No music today, Mr. Gold?
Mr. LaGuardia,
I have asked my client not to answer your questions.
Please talk to me only.
Certainly. What do you need, Ms. Lockhart?
Why is the Public Integrity Division looking into my client?
Who says we're looking into anything?
Well, if you're not, then consider this a polite request.
Don't approach or surveil my client again.
Any further such efforts would be considered harassment.
I only approached your client once--
that hardly warrants, uh...
Ms. Lockhart, uh...
You're showing...
This is a photo I have no previous knowledge of.
If what you showed me is indeed DOJ work product,
whoever gave you that photo broke the law.
Good to know, now, what are you after?
You know my division investigates campaign finance violations.
Yes, which has nothing to do with Mr. Gold's crisis management.
Except some of Mr. Gold's biggest clients have recently
become donors to his wife's campaign.
You're kidding me.
Eli...
There is nothing illegal about clients exercising
their First Amendment rights.
As long as it's at arm's length, yes.
But a quid pro quo in which Mr. Gold
offers savings to crisis management client
in trade for contribution to a political campaign,
that is illegal.
Discount for donations.
And that is what you're accusing?
No... that is what we are investigating.
Your Honor, we ask that the following evidence be admitted.
Cook County crime scene photos of the car trunk
belonging to Troy Mallick.
Got something from your Cook County friend here, have you?
Yes, Your Honor.
It is lovely how prosecutors, defense attorneys
are all working together here.
It gives one hope.
We also ask that the accompanying evidentiary report
of fabric trace evidence be admitted.
Objection, Your Honor.
This evidence is subject to
fruit of the Poisonous Tree exclusion.
Someone illuminate me here-- what is this evidence?
That's right. Take your time.
Your Honor, this is evidence collected from the car trunk
of the Chicago defendant Troy Mallick.
The man with whom the victim attended the concert.
Now as you can see,
trace evidence from the victim's clothing
was found in his car trunk,
suggesting the Chicago defendant transported the victim...
No, it does not suggest that.
The Chicago defendant explained this evidence.
He carried a grocery bag...
Sleeping!
Sleeping bag in his trunk.
And the fabric transferred from the bag.
Well, if the prosecution believes that,
then let them argue it in court.
Your Honor,
the Chicago police searched the trunk without a warrant,
that is why this evidence was barred from court.
Yeah, no, Chicago court, not Minooka court.
But the same rules apply.
No! Fruit of the Poisonous Tree argument applies
to due process of the Chicago defendant.
She's using that as exculpatory evidence
for a totally different defendant.
Yes, but due to the constitutional exclusion,
this evidence was never subject
to the same stringent analysis as the defendant in Chicago...
Thank you. Thank-thank you.
One and all.
What we have here is a battle of the proxies,
and unfortunately, Ms. Florrick, Mr. Tripke,
the fruit of the poisonous tree grows in Chicago.
Its limbs do not extend here.
We will allow this evidence.
What else you got?
I'll get back to you.
Use the one in the living room!
It's me.
Oh, Mom. Hey, sorry.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Why does everyone think something's wrong
when I come to their room.
Everyone?
Who's everyone?
My children-- my various children throughout Chicago.
Are you all right, Mom?
Too many hours in court.
How are you?
I'm good.
And how's Connor?
Connor?
He's good, I guess. Why?
Tell me about him.
About Connor?
I-I don't know-- I already did.
No...
I only know that you...
go to the same school
and that his girlfriend was the one who did that...
Not his girlfriend-- they broke up.
Okay, um...
Tell me about him.
Okay. Uh, well, he's nice.
Um, he wants to live in Thailand.
There's this one city in Thailand
where, um, they have a festival once a year
and basically everyone throws water at each other.
So, it's like this massive citywide water fight.
And-and he wants to do that after school?
Well, just for a year.
Ah. And then he'll go to college.
So, you two have gotten close?
Just as friends.
And he's a Christian, too?
No.
But you are?
You're still a Christian?
You don't have to say "A Christian"
You can just say "Christian."
And, yeah. Why?
You used the hard line on my desktop computer?
Yeah.
Someone did a search there.
Trying to find out about... something.
What?
Condoms.
Oh, my God, Mom!
I didn't know... I didn't know if it was you.
Oh, no!
And if it was, it is not a problem.
But I think maybe we should talk about it.
You really think I'd use your computer
to find out about condoms?
I didn't know. We haven't had a talk.
Because I don't want to.
Well, maybe We need to have it now.
No, Mom. No, thanks, really.
I really don't want to.
You okay?
Yeah.
And you're being a good girl?
I'm being a good girl.
Okay, good.
I'm here if you need to talk.
Brock Dalyndro-- D-A-L-Y-N-D-R-O.
And did you attend the Alt-O-Rama concert last May?
Yeah. All three days-- it was killer.
Could you please tell us what you saw?
I was coming back to the campsite,
Sabbath had just finished their set, and my head was ringing.
And, uh, I saw a guy coming out with a blanket over his shoulder,
putting it into the trunk of a car.
How far away were you from this man?
Maybe ten, 15 feet.
So, close enough to see there was something in the blanket?
Objection, leading.
Sustained.
Why did you notice this blanket?
Well, I saw what looked like a body in it.
From the way he was carrying it.
Objection, speculation.
Sustained.
Do you recognize that man you saw in this room today, Brock?
Yeah... him.
The witness is pointing to the defendant,
Troy Mallick. Nothing further.
Try getting out of that one.
Mr. Dalyndro, had you been drinking the night of the concert?
I had a few beers, I guess.
A few-- how many is that?
Maybe seven or eight?
Okay, you done any drugs?
I might've smoked a little pot, but...
But it wasn't mine though.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh, so you smoked pot,
you drank seven or eight beers,
it was dark out, crowded, noisy...
Yeah, but I know what I saw.
You saw a man carrying a blanket?
Yeah. With a mountain on it.
I'm sorry, what?
The blanket, it...
it had this mountain peak on it.
I see. That seems to be a new detail.
You never mentioned that to the police.
Well, I never thought of it till now.
Uh-huh. And what else might you think of in another week's time?
Objection.
Sustained.
Now, let's turn to your identification of this mysterious man.
Your Honor, may we approach the bench?
Excuse me, Ms. Hellinger, I'm in the midst of questioning.
Your Honor?
Please approach.
Your Honor, it gives me no delight in saying this,
but I believe the defense is prepared to contravene your ruling.
What?
Mr. Gardner intends to show
this witness a photo of a man wearing an identical shirt
to trick him into IDing him as the killer,
then reveal it's, in fact, the accused in Minooka.
What?
How do you know this, ASA Hellinger?
Yes, how do you know this?
I don't, Your Honor,
but I've caught on to Mr. Gardner's tricks.
This is just outrageous.
I believe that that photo there on the defense table
is, in fact, the Minooka defendant.
Let's see it, Mr. Gardner.
Your Honor...
Let's see it.
Let's see it.
Okay, here's the thing.
Yes, it's that photo,
but the real galling thing here
is that the jury will never be allowed to know
that Minooka killer could be easily confused for my client.
Yes, thank you.
That's ten more thousand dollars in contempt fines,
Mr. Gardner, now, step back.
What does it feel like to be so predictable?
Tell Nick I'll be at work.
It's time to end this.
I learned my second piece, Mr. Gold, "Danny Boy""
Congratulations.
The accordion.
At first, I thought,
who plays the accordion, but then I kind of liked it.
It's unusual. Mm.
The Fed who plays the accordion.
That's right.
We've looked into Wooster-Graff Industries donations
to Vanessa Gold.
I'm sorry, do you want to talk more about accordions?
No, done.
We've looked into the donations
to Vanessa Gold's campaign,
and we feel confident that Eli has done nothing wrong.
Well, that's great. Phew.
But given that Mr. Gold's campaigns are highly visible,
we want to know how we can satisfy the Justice Department's
insatiable appetite for information.
A proffer.
As to what?
Indiscretions by the candidate.
I'm not gonna turn on my ex-wife.
No. Peter Florrick.
You're accusing Mr. Gold
of soliciting illegal donations for Peter Florrick?
No. But we would be willing to drop any charges against Mr. Gold
in trade for a proffer on Mr. Florrick.
Go to hell.
I would advise you
to talk things over with your lawyer, Mr. Gold.
I'd imagine she'd urge patience.
After he cools down, have him give me a call.
Go to hell.
He's lying.
Making up details-- a mountain on a blanket.
I don't think he was lying.
Troy's company is called WaterCleanse.
It's a home-filtering water company.
And that
is their logo.
I'm not sure what...
Turn it upside down.
There's your mountain.
It was on a blanket, not a...
Our client is guilty.
We don't know that.
You're right, we don't.
And either way, we have a duty to
zealously represent our clients.
What about the defendant in Minooka?
What about him?
I've been helping the prosecution convict an innocent man.
No, you've been supplying the prosecution with
true information to help them win a case.
Yes. Against an innocent man.
So what do I do?
Out there in Minooka?
Do I continue to help them convict a man i know is innocent
in order to represent my client who I know is not?
We have to zealously represent the interests of our client.
It's our job.
We can hate it,
but it's our job.
And that's why your office
never considered my client a suspect?
Yes.
There was too much real evidence
to support our suspect in Chicago.
The trace evidence from the victim's dress...
Yes. It's true we couldn't present it in court...
Anything else?
...but it was a damning picture.
Go for Tillman.
Nothing further, Your Honor.
Mr. Brody, you are quite confident
that your defendant in Chicago
is the person responsible for this crime.
Yes, sir.
And were you equally confident
with the Ryan Tillman murder case?
That wasn't my fault.
Yes.
But were you equally confident?
Objection, Your Honor, relevance.
What is this case?
A murder that Mr. Brody prosecuted
that sent a man to prison for...
ten years.
He was recently exonerated.
No, Alma, I will allow.
It goes to credibility.
Were you equally confident
prosecuting Mr. Tillman?
sex
Okay.
You have another problem.
Just one?
That was the employer of the defendant in Minooka.
It's a landscaping company,
and it uses the same soil treatment
as the concert campground.
Yeah.
So... the soil on Gary Kuharski's shoes
was probably from his work site.
So I gave the prosecution inaccurate evidence.
And I can't tell them, can I?
Well...
it'll become public record.
And then the state's attorney could use it against our client.
Yep.
So I have to keep my mouth shut,
while an innocent man may go to jail.
It's one of those dilemmas that doesn't come up in law school.
No. No, we can't win without downstate anymore.
We need to hit Maddie right in her base of su...
Yeah?
Um, Mr. Gold, you better come out here.
You're gonna want to seize the hard drives,
all the cell phones.
Someone's got to get started on those files over there.
Hi, Mr. Gold. So good to see you again.
What the hell are you doing?
We are raiding your office.
You're gonna want to wrap up that call right now.
Over there. Yep.
Shut it down, shut it down.
You can keep your coffee. Yeah, print.
Hang it up. Hang it up right now.
You, too, bud.
Hey, Mom?
Mm. Hey, I am running late.
I was thinking about what happened with your computer,
so I ran a cache search.
Um, sometimes if you haven't cleared your cache,
you can tell when a certain search was run.
Well, I can pretty much say I've never cleaned my cache.
It was Thanksgiving night.
12 P.M. That's when the search was run.
Well, we were all here then.
Yeah, we were, but...
Here, look at this.
Two minutes before,
the browser logged into that e-mail page.
Which means...?
That's Grandma's e-mail page.
My mom's?
No. Jackie's.
I...
Uh, so you're saying she...
Zach?
Yeah?
We never speak of this again.
I'm good with that.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I understand you have reached a verdict.
Yes, we have, Your Honor.
Very well.
Would you read the verdict, please, Mr. Foreman?
In the matter of The People
of the State of Illinois v. Gary L. Kuharski,
on the charge of first degree murder,
we the jury find the defendant...
...guilty.
...guilty.
You heading out?
Well, I was thinking about it.
I think I owe you.
Okay.
You were good.
Thank you.
You were, too.
It's tough to get them off when they're guilty.
Let's agree to disagree.
Either way, tough break for the guy in Minooka.
Our case is over.
Our guy got convicted.
Meaning...?
Our duty's discharged.
So if we have anything that could help that guy on his appeal...
we can use it.
Okay.
To the next one.
I can't wait.
You know, the next time you want to get my attention,
just give me a call.
There won't be a next time.
Why's that?
'Cause you're leaving.
Am I?
Where am I goin'?
I just made a call to the police
about your tow truck operation smuggling drugs.
That's a shame.
Cops are already at the yard, Nick.
It's too late.
There's nothing here for you anymore.
So your best bet...
is to cross the border here.
And here's a key...
to a locker at the Point Edward bus station.
I placed half my $20,000 there.
I want you to take it,
and go.
You know there's nothing left between us, Nick.
Nothing.
So why don't you get the hell out of here?
I don't think you did call the cops.
That's not your style.
So...
what's your plan B?
Kalinda, I'm just wondering where you are. Give me a call.
What did I miss?
Oh. Not much. Where were you?
Out.
You look relieved.
I'm.
He's gone.
And you're safe?
Yeah. You are, too.
Good.
What if he comes back?
He's not coming back.
You sure?
Yes.
