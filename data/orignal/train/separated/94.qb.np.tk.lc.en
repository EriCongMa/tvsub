first time ?
excuse me ?
um , is it your first time voting ?
uh , yes .
your name ?
zach florrick .
why , you have the same last name as one of the candidates .
really ?
i know what it &apos;s like .
my last name is eisenhower .
uh , do you need any help ?
i think i should be fine . thank you .
迈克 · 克里斯特瓦
excuse me , ma &apos;am .
uh , did you see that ballot box over there in the corner ?
uh , no , you put your ballot in here .
yes , i know . i just ...
there &apos;s a ballot box over there with a broken seal .
ballot boxes are supposed to be sealed ,
and the seal &apos;s ripped .
are you sure ?
yes .
what &apos;s up , nana ?
uh , this young man
thinks there &apos;s a problem with a ballot box .
excuse me . what are you doing ?
taking a picture .
well , you can &apos;t do that .
take a picture ? of course i can .
no , no , it &apos;s actually illegal .
it &apos;s only illegal if you &apos;re taking a photo of someone who &apos;s voting .
there &apos;s no one voting .
excuse me .
i am the polling monitor here ,
and i &apos;m gonna have to ask you to leave .
we &apos;re still confident , your honor .
the polls have us neck and neck .
it &apos;s just gonna all come down to our get @-@ out @-@ the @-@ vote ...
eli ,
i want cristian to be on the stage with us .
he &apos;s family .
yeah , whatever .
alicia , hold on . i &apos;m having trouble hearing you .
eli , what did my mother just say to you ?
oh , she wants her helper on the dais .
peter , we may be having trouble with early voting .
i don &apos;t want cristian on the dais .
what ?
peter , is this really important ?
god .
everybody out .
come on ! out , out , out . out !
go downstairs . come on ! nora , get these people out of here .
put that down .
so what did zach see ?
zach was early voting in the 43rd ward ,
and he may have seen a stuffed ballot box of kresteva votes .
why does he think it was stuffed ?
because the ballot box had a ripped seal .
he thinks it was a ripped seal or he knows it was a ripped seal ?
he took a picture .
i &apos;m looking at it now .
alicia , tomorrow &apos;s election day .
all our lawyers are downstate .
can you ask diane to take this ?
i think she &apos;s at dinner . you want me to call will ?
no . diane is incentivized .
if peter doesn &apos;t win ...
right , she doesn &apos;t get the judgeship . okay , i &apos;ll call you back .
okay .
kresteva is trying to steal this election , and we have to stop him .
okay .
where are you worried about the most kresteva votes ?
addison township . 41st ward .
uh , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m gonna take care of it .
you want to know how ?
no . i don &apos;t know . do i ?
it &apos;s ten hours till the polls open .
i have a septic truck ready .
i &apos;m gonna park it in front of the main precinct in the 41st
and ... accidentally spill it .
okay ?
this is perfect . wow .
my office here .
conference room there . i love it .
how much is it ?
$ 60 a square foot .
we &apos;re not gonna find much cheaper in the loop .
not if we want to move in in two weeks .
well , we can &apos;t afford $ 60 a square foot .
we can if we reduce our upfront salary costs .
okay , and how do we do that ?
kalinda .
we all agreed .
we pay her ask . that &apos;s the only way she &apos;ll come with us .
we changed our minds .
look , guys .
kalinda wins cases .
we split off from lockhart / gardner ,
we need to win . that &apos;s how we grow .
maybe there &apos;s someone else who can win cases cheaper .
and maybe there &apos;s someone who can win cases
and pay us , but that &apos;s unlikely .
that &apos;s diane .
i have to go .
ask kalinda if she &apos;ll take a commitment to bump up
in the second year .
i &apos;ll see you guys down in the bar in an hour .
judy , stop it right now or we &apos;ll all be yawning in a minute .
i &apos;m judge abernathy .
i &apos;m the magistrate on call for electioneering disputes .
well , what is the issue , counselor ?
we have some question about the provenance of ballots
we discovered in early voting .
and we ask for emergency relief before voting is concluded
in approximately 21 hours .
and you , sir ,
you are here to represent the interests of the kresteva campaign ?
no , i am , your honor .
apologies for my lateness .
the campaign just asked me to step in .
and who better to argue at an all @-@ night session
than a mother who would be up anyway ?
you can go now .
welcome , ma &apos;am . and i see that
you have some ... uh , accoutrements with you .
yes , my babies , your honor .
i &apos;m sorry , but i have to breastfeed the little one
or she won &apos;t sleep through the night .
okay . just ...
try to keep them quiet , okay ?
yes . thank you , your honor .
could you please tell us what you saw tonight
at the 5th precinct in the 43rd ward .
yes .
i saw an unsealed box of votes being carried in
and placed in the corner .
and did you happen to take a picture of those ballots ?
yeah , with my cell phone .
sorry , your honor .
no . that &apos;s quite all right . we &apos;ll just wait .
so , zach , this photo that you took ,
is that the ballot box seal ripped ?
it is .
i tender the witness .
just be honest .
so ...
zach florrick ,
what did your mother whisper to you just now ?
she whispered , &quot; just be honest . &quot;
i see .
so she was afraid you wouldn &apos;t be ?
objection , your honor ,
i gave my son the same advice i would give any first @-@ time witness .
withdrawn .
now , zach , have you ever been arrested ?
objection . relevance .
goes to character .
my son was pulled over once ,
but the prosecutor dropped the charge
excuse me , your honor . i &apos;m questioning a witness ,
not his mother .
yes , mrs. florrick , please .
why were you arrested , zach ?
for recording a police officer .
taking his picture .
so ... this would be the second time in eight months
you &apos;ve seen something you thought corrupt and took a picture ?
sure .
seems to happen a lot to you ?
well , it &apos;s happened twice .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;d call that &quot; a lot . &quot;
this last time you were pulled over for drug possession .
a charge that was dropped .
mrs. florrick .
i was pulled over , but i wasn &apos;t carrying drugs .
the policeman seemed to disagree .
the policeman was wrong .
do you question authority a lot ?
no . only when it &apos;s wrong .
yes , i saw him taking pictures , and i told him to stop .
and he said he wouldn &apos;t ,
so i threatened to call the police .
and this photo he took ,
you &apos;re saying those were not unsecured ballots ?
that &apos;s correct , they were ballots from earlier in the week .
but he said he saw a man bring them in .
well , that was one of the , uh ... the poll workers .
i asked him to move them .
i see .
i think young mr. florrick may have a tendency to exaggerate .
objection !
my goodness .
ms. lockhart , good evening .
you &apos;ve decided to join our little slumber party ?
i have , your honor .
you couldn &apos;t keep me away .
sorry . my sciatica is acting up .
i have to walk every 20 minutes or my doctor yells at me .
would you like me to take a pause ?
no , no , no . keep going . i can hear .
just one more question , mr. buckley . um ...
why was this ballot box unsealed at all ?
well , i tried to lift it , and i accidentally ...
i @-@ i ripped the seal .
oh . nothing further .
mr. buckley ,
you are a registered republican , isn &apos;t that correct ?
it is .
though i &apos;m not sure what that has to do with this .
you want mr. kresteva to win .
objection , your honor . uh ...
uh , mr. buckley &apos;s candidate preference is not an issue .
i would agree . sustained .
your honor , by all accounts ,
this will be a very close election .
some polls suggest 1,000 votes will determine
whether peter florrick
or mike kresteva is governor .
and so we ask that this box be impounded by the court ...
your honor , this is not a police state .
until such time as their provenance can be determined .
and if the vote count suggests ,
a one @-@ sided count in favor of mr. kresteva ,
we would argue that fraud charges be brought .
your honor , this is a blatant attempt ...
your honor ,
we have less than 24 hours before the polls close .
okay . time out .
five @-@ minute recess .
we need you to look into the provenance of these ballots .
quickly . now . cary ,
look into the background of this republican monitor .
any connection to kresteva .
got it . kalinda .
kalinda , we need to talk .
we can &apos;t pay your ask .
okay .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
just listen to me .
you have the chance to get in on the ground floor of something .
cary , please , don &apos;t sell me .
within a year , we will prom ...
good evening .
hi . will .
within a year , we &apos;ll promise you ten percent more
than lockhart / gardner .
you give me five percent of all profits
for the first three years .
you want me to get excited about the ground floor idea ,
five percent , no overhead , clean .
hi , patti . it &apos;s odd you &apos;re in on this .
the pharmaceutical industry likes kresteva over your boy .
is this a new one ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve lost track .
you can call me nana joe .
i love your beret .
i took it off out of respect .
no , put it on .
thank you , nana joe .
that is a lovely beret .
mr. buckley said that he acci ...
uh , just keep going .
mr. buckley said he accidentally ... ripped the box &apos;s seal
when he tried to move it . is that correct ?
i was there all day and i didn &apos;t see him move from his office .
but you did see someone enter your polling place with the box ?
i remember because i thought he was a voter .
and then i saw this big box in his arms .
thank you , nana .
good luck crossing grandma moses .
hi , nana joe .
when was the last time you had your eyes checked ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
a few months ago .
and can you see all the way back to that door back there ?
yeah , i guess .
so , if i walk back here ...
your honor , object ...
objection .
this kind of stunt went out with perry mason .
and yet , i enjoy it every time .
thank you , your honor .
nana joe ,
how many fingers am i holding up ?
uh , it looks like , uh , three . mm .
actually , it &apos;s two .
thank you , nana joe .
and thank you for your service to the city .
nana joe ,
when this man entered the polling place ,
was he as far away as that door ?
well , just at first ,
but then he came right past me .
past you ?
closer than i am ?
a little closer .
this close ?
little closer .
this close .
and how many fingers am i holding up ?
two .
thank you , nana .
uh , i have good news for everyone .
we have located the ballot box in question .
45s @-@ 721 .
your honor , we ask that these ballots be immediately counted
to determine whether a fraud ...
the sanctity
of the voting booth must not be breached , your honor .
we &apos;re not breaching it , we &apos;re determining how many votes ...
i am not going to allow another gore v. bush .
well , i have some good news
the votes have been counted .
there are 30,843 total .
that is a considerable chunk for such a small polling place .
how many votes are for kresteva ?
2685 .
26,000 ?
no , 2,600 .
yes . that &apos;s a surprise .
the rest are for florrick . 28,158 .
we ... your honor , um ...
would you like to change your motion ?
yes , we-- actually , we are going to withdraw the motion
out of respect for the voting process .
we &apos;d like to make a motion , your honor .
of course you would .
these ballots are fraudulent and should be thrown out .
that &apos;s five percent , cary .
right , but if we make nothing ,
kalinda makes nothing .
i &apos;ve been watching lockhart / gardner make all the same mistakes :
overpromising .
we said we shouldn &apos;t overextend ourselves ...
we aren &apos;t !
their mistake was committing money they didn &apos;t have .
maybe you &apos;re a little too close to this , cary .
what does that mean ?
you have no objectivity about kalinda .
i have just as much objectivity as anyone .
no . we haven &apos;t slept with her .
okay .
uh , i think this is going off the rails a bit .
is that colin sweeney ?
what does he want ?
mr. agos .
i wanted to toast your new venture .
my new ...
yes , your little rebellion .
it &apos;s in the air .
like les mis rables .
did you see that musical ?
vive la resistance , eh ?
i &apos;m not ... i &apos;m not sure ...
i own the building .
my manager told me you were considering a lease .
what are you looking for , mr. sweeney ?
i want a discount on my legal services .
you can have 20 % savings on my office space ,
and i get two years of free , unlimited legal work .
work it out .
it &apos;s a good deal .
alicia &apos;s not coming with us .
the voters have spoken .
exactly .
that is the point , your honor .
no , where did these votes come from ? out of the blue ?
ms. nyholm has just spent the last two hours
arguing the opposite .
as has everyone .
if the preponderance of the votes were for kresteva ,
it would be fraud .
well , the preponderance of the votes are for florrick ...
your honor , i know ms. nyholm
thinks she can shout her way to a positive result ...
no , i &apos;m not shouting ,
i &apos;m making my point clearly ...
there were 30,843 ballots .
28,158 were for you , peter .
do you think they &apos;ll be thrown out ?
i don &apos;t know .
diane and will are arguing to keep them .
will is arguing ?
yes .
they &apos;re doing their best ,
but we just spent two hours arguing the opposite .
we need those votes .
all of them . we think it &apos;s that close .
i know .
we &apos;re trying .
okay , hon , i &apos;ll see you in a little bit , okay ?
okay , see you later .
you . you .
you think she knows i &apos;m losing ?
i &apos;ve dedicated my life to not predicting what jackie knows .
jim . is there any way we can make up those 30,000 votes ?
yeah . maybe in the 18th ward .
what kind of walk @-@ around money you got ?
i &apos;ll go find out .
jim , i want you to do me a favor .
my mother &apos;s nurse , cristian romero--
i want you to check him out .
sure .
financial , criminal , personal ?
everything .
i want to know if he &apos;s using my mom .
but you swear that these ballots
are the result of early voting over the last week ?
yes .
and , sir , you are republican ?
yes , i am still a republican .
and therefore ,
it is not in your interest to have these votes benefit a democrat ?
mr. buckley ,
is it true that you
wrote an essay for the american spectator criticizing mitt romney ?
so , your eyesight is perfectly fine , nana ,
and you saw a suspicious man carrying in these ballots ?
objection . she didn &apos;t say &quot; suspicious . &quot;
was the man suspicious , nana ?
yes , a bit .
you saw a suspicious man carrying in ballots ?
and you have no reason to lie here today .
nana joe ...
do you take the prescription medicine memantine ?
yes .
and why do you take this medicine ?
my doctor told me to .
but it &apos;s an alzheimer &apos;s medicine , isn &apos;t that correct ?
i &apos;m not showing the symptoms .
so , then , why do you take it ?
i told you , my doctor said .
nana , when &apos;s your husband &apos;s birthday ?
uh ... you don &apos;t know , do you ?
i &apos;m checking my datebook .
yes , but off the top of your head , you don &apos;t know .
isn &apos;t it possible , ma &apos;am ,
that you forgot that mr. buckley told you
he wanted the ballots moved ...
i don &apos;t forget things .
things like your husband &apos;s birthday ?
i just want to go home .
can i go home ?
can you remember your address ?
objection , your honor .
he &apos;s badgering ...
it &apos;s a fair question , your honor .
so , zach , you were just being a good citizen
when you took pictures of the cop who pulled you over ?
i guess .
and this cop was later fired
for his activities ?
i didn &apos;t know that .
he was .
you were instrumental
in getting a crooked cop off the streets .
well , i wouldn &apos;t go that far .
don &apos;t be humble .
your mom must be very proud of you .
and you definitely saw
these ballots being carried in off the street
and not moved from one place to another in the polling place ?
well ...
you do know the penalty for perjury ?
objection .
uh , yes .
uh , can we all just assume that witnesses know they shouldn &apos;t lie ?
yes , thank you , your honor .
just a simple question , zach .
do you believe these unsealed ballots
came in off the street ?
yes .
thank you ,
zach , for being honest .
i know there must be a lot of pressure on you not to .
anything from the defense ?
i &apos;ll do it .
no , i will .
zach , how long were you in the 5th precinct polling place ?
about ten minutes .
and did you see what happened in the precinct
in the time before you arrived or the time after ?
no .
so you had no way of knowing
where these men carrying the ballot box came from originally ?
yes . that &apos;s true .
and you had no way of knowing
whether these men received orders from mr. buckley or not ?
that &apos;s right .
so it &apos;s not lying to acknowledge the limits of your own testimony ?
that &apos;s right .
and so do you know if these ballots were fraudulent or not ,
or if the seal on the ballot box was ripped
accidentally or never attached ?
i have no way of knowing .
good . thank you , zach .
and so , if there &apos;s nothing further , i ...
okay .
uh , we need to put a pause in these proceedings .
it appears that there is now a matter being adjudicated
in the federal court which will make this matter moot .
in the federal court ? what is it ?
an injunction on the ballot as a whole .
from which campaign ?
uh , the third party .
go to the suite .
i &apos;ll meet you after we deal with this .
we &apos;ll come with you .
no . zach , i don &apos;t know how long this will go ,
and i don &apos;t have time to argue .
i &apos;m gonna call dad and tell him you &apos;re coming .
will , wait up .
wait , mom , come with us . we &apos;ll take you .
no , i &apos;m fine . go , grace .
hello ?
alicia , how are you ?
who is this ?
i &apos;m hurt . you really don &apos;t know ?
mr. sweeney ?
it &apos;s 1 a.m.
colin sweeney ? what does he want ?
look , mr. sweeney , i &apos;m a little busy .
yes , campaign night . congratulations .
i voted for your husband .
can @-@ can we talk tomorrow ?
no .
i think you should join mr. agos in his new firm .
what does he want ?
uh , nothing . a case .
oh , are we keeping things from our betters ?
i &apos;m thinking of moving my business with mr. agos .
that &apos;s $ 22 million a year .
you don &apos;t want to lose out on that , do you ?
mr. sweeney , this is not neither the time ...
yes , i know you &apos;re a partner now , alicia ,
but it &apos;s a smart move .
go with the up and coming .
that was abrupt .
yeah , he was going on .
okay , let &apos;s start again .
if you don &apos;t mind .
come on in . we just started .
please continue , sir .
thank you , your honor .
i &apos;m campaign manager for third @-@ party candidate albert o &apos;dell ,
and i have evidence that this election &apos;s a fraud .
the problem is the ballot used in early voting .
my candidate &apos;s name is albert o &apos;dell .
and the ballot left out the apostrophe ,
as you can see right there .
i &apos;ll argue this one , you argue the next ?
agreed .
your honor ,
the third @-@ party candidate has been polling at 3.2 percent .
mr .... - karahalios .
eh ... the third @-@ party campaign manager
is suggesting the disenfranchising of 800,000 early votes
all because of a missing apostrophe ?
that is ridiculous .
in your opinion .
is that in your opinion ?
oh . um , uh , yes .
uh , in my opinion . of course .
yes , mr. karahalios , i &apos;m not sure
a typo rises to the level of a civil rights matter .
my candidate is
counting on the irish vote , your honor .
you lose the apostrophe ,
and the irish &quot; o &apos;dell &quot;
suddenly becomes the english &quot; odell . &quot;
illinois is 15 % irish . in my opinion ,
this typo &apos;s the difference between winning or losing .
i hate to break it to you , buddy ,
but you &apos;re the third party .
you &apos;re gonna lose .
and , yes , that &apos;s my opinion .
okay , we got an apostrophe problem .
i &apos;m awake .
we need arguments why the judge should allow
this third party &apos;s misprint in the early voting ballots .
anything you can find , anyone you can wake up .
cary ? do you want me
to tell the partners you &apos;re leaving ?
excuse me ?
stop stealing my clients ,
or so help me , cary , i &apos;ll tell them .
alicia , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i got a call from colin sweeney .
yes , that &apos;s right .
sweeney , my client .
no . alicia , he approached me .
he did not approach you .
we were looking for real estate .
he said he &apos;d give us a 20 % discount for free legal work .
i &apos;d never approach him , alicia .
i &apos;d never steal one of your clients . never .
hi . sorry .
robyn , we &apos;re talking .
yeah , um , but i have something on the misprint .
what ?
a friend of mine-- she works for the third @-@ party campaign .
and she says albert o &apos;dell is jewish .
o &apos;dell is not his real name .
good . we can run with that .
thanks , robyn .
you &apos;re welcome .
robyn ?
how are you liking it at lockhart / gardner ?
your honor , before you decide on this matter ,
we have new information .
what is that ?
if i may address mr. karahalios .
what is your candidate &apos;s full name ?
albert seamus o &apos;dell , with the apostrophe .
and who is albert steinman ?
i don &apos;t know . who are you referring to ?
mr. o &apos;dell &apos;s real name before he changed it .
certainly within his legal rights to change his name .
but he has no actual irish roots , correct ?
just because you have a name that doesn &apos;t sound irish
doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re not irish .
a name like odell , for example , without an apostrophe ?
your honor ,
there has been no real damage here
because mr. steinman--
or as he is now called , mr. o &apos;dell--
has no irish heritage to be damaged , in my opinion .
yes . i overrule the motion for emergency relief .
how &apos;s jackie doing ?
good . she wants to go on a cruise .
really ?
yes . she watches the tv commercials .
mm @-@ hmm . and you &apos;ll go on a cruise with her ?
no . i &apos;ve had enough water for a lifetime .
right , right . coming over from cuba .
no . working as a lifeguard .
oh . so , um , peter wanted me to talk to you , cristian .
after the election ,
they won &apos;t need your services much anymore .
i see .
well , if jackie &apos;s fine with that , i am fine .
this is coming from peter .
i &apos;ll have to speak to jackie .
i &apos;ve seen your arrest record , cristian .
really ?
drunk and disorderly , simple assault .
in daytona beach .
not a good thing .
yes . terrible .
and your debts .
$ 18,000 to the oceanfront inn .
i think they &apos;re still looking for you .
peter can be quite generous .
this is a check for $ 25,000 .
it &apos;s his personal thank you to you .
you take it , you leave tonight .
you tell jackie you had some issues in florida .
and why would i do that ?
oh , well , to be blunt , peter is going to be governor ,
and he thinks you &apos;re using his mother .
oh . what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
abernathy is on a sciatica walk ,
and the guard won &apos;t let us in until he &apos;s back .
go ahead and sleep .
you broke up with laura ?
no . she with me .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re still friends ?
i don &apos;t know .
i think she thinks
i was getting between you two .
that kiss opened up something between us again , didn &apos;t it ?
i don &apos;t know how to close it .
i know .
but if we pursue it ,
it &apos;ll just be like last time .
what was last time ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;ll be worse .
i &apos;m with peter , and i just ...
i can &apos;t figure my way out of this one .
oh , god .
what do we do ?
this night is over , we talk .
we can &apos;t .
to hell with the bad timing .
we talk .
psst , judy ? judy ?
uh , so , i imagine your field trip was productive .
yes , your honor .
and when we left , you were ready to decide .
actually , your honor ,
we do have one more witness .
oh , not poor nana joe again .
i think she was ready to collapse .
no , a new witness . jordan kalla @-@ haley @-@ car ...
jordan karahalios ? i &apos;m sorry , your honor .
we have to object to this on the grounds ...
he was fired from the florrick ...
and how many months did you work for mr. florrick &apos;s campaign ?
three . i was relieved of my duties in march .
so you have some insider
information on the issue of this ballot box ?
i do . uh , at a meeting on february 18,
eli gold and i discussed ways to sweeten the vote
if the election was close .
and what were mr. gold &apos;s thoughts on this sweetening ?
a drop box .
objection , your honor .
this witness is doubly biased .
he was fired by our client ,
and he works for the third party .
then you can argue that in your cross .
and did you argue against this drop box ?
he likes the third party candidate .
i did , strenuously , but i was overruled by mr. gold .
it is almost 5 : 00 a.m. now .
the polls will be open in one hour , and
i find myself humbled in the face of this decision .
as has been said by many of you at various times ,
there is a sanctity to the voting booth , but ...
... that sanctity is not absolute .
it needs our constant vigilance .
it needs our confidence
that the votes are , in fact , true .
i hereby am ordering
that these 30,843 votes be excluded
from any vote total , and that they be
provisionally preserved for a possible appeal .
and good night .
get some rest .
i &apos;ll start the appeal process .
i better go tell peter .
sad to think you can lose an election in court these days .
why the hurry , huh ?
the place is gonna blow .
what time is it ?
5 : 45 .
polls open in 15 minutes .
what are you watching ?
hostel 3 .
i love horror movies .
do you know why i love horror movies ?
why ?
because they &apos;re awesome .
we &apos;re gonna lose , aren &apos;t we ?
yes .
is peter prepared ?
he &apos;s adjusted his thinking .
you ran a great campaign , eli .
he &apos;ll need you .
he loves you .
zach ... wake up .
mom ... what &apos;s up ?
shh , shh , shh . i have an idea .
i need your help .
thank you , your honor ,
for hearing one of our witnesses again .
your honor , i think i speak for the whole world when i say
can we please all get some sleep ?
patience , ms. nyholm .
zach , you &apos;re still under oath .
so you &apos;ve been working for the florrick campaign
these last seven months .
yes , in the i.t. department .
ah , good morning . we &apos;ve sent out for bagels .
thank you , your honor .
now jordan karahalios stated that eli met with him
on february 18 , and told him , over jordan &apos;s objections ,
that they needed to consider a stuffed ballot box .
are you aware of this testimony ?
i &apos;ve been made aware of it .
and do you know this testimony to be false ?
i do .
how do you know that ?
because eli wasn &apos;t the campaign manager on february 18 .
he had been replaced by jordan .
so jordan couldn &apos;t have been overruled by eli ? or anyone ?
not true !
eli gold was still consulting with the campaign .
mr. kamahama @-@ halios , please take your seat .
so , jordan was the campaign manager at that point in time ?
he was the boss ?
yes , that &apos;s correct .
i tender the witness .
so let &apos;s return to your arrest , shall we ?
no , counselor . we &apos;ve pretty much bounced every way
we can on this witness &apos;s reliability .
thank you , mr. florrick . you may step down .
uh , you &apos;ll have my revised ruling in a few hours .
you were great .
thanks .
hey , what you watching ?
video .
can i ask you a hypothetical ?
no .
so let &apos;s say i &apos;m approached about leaving the law firm ,
and joining a small start @-@ up firm , right ?
and i &apos;m offered more money than here .
but i like it here .
and i &apos;ll also probably like it at this law firm , too .
so do you make your decision
based on money or loyalty ?
um , how much more money are they offering you ?
in my hypothetical ?
in your hypothetical .
it &apos;s a good amount-- 20 % more .
hey , what do i do ?
you should go with cary .
will , you &apos;d better see this .
kalinda ... i was up all night .
i know . so was i. will .
that &apos;s outside the polling place .
yeah . a surveillance camera across the street .
jim moody .
he works for the florrick campaign .
where &apos;d you get this ?
talked to the mini @-@ mart across the street .
are there any other copies ?
no . just this one .
i heard it went well in court .
it did . your son did good .
but you have something for me ?
can you just give us a minute please ?
thank you .
kalinda found some evidence .
no one else has seen it .
and you &apos;re telling me this why ?
i want to know what to do with it .
well , you &apos;re the lawyer . you decide .
this decision needs to be the client &apos;s .
why are you doing this ?
i need direction .
no , if you needed direction ,
you &apos;d have given it to alicia to show me .
i didn &apos;t want to hurt her .
you &apos;ve really handled this poorly .
that &apos;s possible .
she &apos;s my wife .
then punch me .
it shows your 30,000 votes are fraudulent .
if it goes to the judge , you &apos;ll lose .
then i &apos;ll lose .
this seems to be some kind of a lesson in mutual hypocrisy
which i &apos;m not gonna participate in .
so you want me to bury it ?
do what you want .
you want me to lose , show it to the judge .
you want me to win , don &apos;t .
i &apos;m not owning this decision .
what do you think ?
i think we &apos;re good .
oh , no , no , no . everybody , sit down . i &apos;m fine .
okay , so ,
uh , in thinking over my early determination ,
i thought of a story .
uh , it &apos;s about a very young boy ,
um , an old man and a donkey .
what the hell , i &apos;m too tired .
judgment in favor of the defense .
the votes are to be admitted .
we did it .
thank you .
thank you .
it &apos;s a good thing .
it is .
oh , my god .
i didn &apos;t think that would happen !
and did you see the totals ?
hey !
you won by over a half million votes .
what ?
yeah , yeah .
oh , the polling was off .
we didn &apos;t need to go to court , and fight tooth and nail .
hey , where &apos;s alicia ? i have to find alicia .
no . you got to be downstairs in the ballroom in 15 minutes .
and you @-@ know @-@ who &apos;s here .
he made it ?
yeah , yeah , he &apos;s here for a meeting of his ,
uh , reduce gun violence coalition .
peter , congratulations .
or should i say condolences ?
with the deficit you &apos;re gonna have to deal with .
eli .
eli , nice to see you .
this is my deputy mayor , patty harris .
nice to meet you .
listen , i &apos;ve got tickets , uh , any time you want them

oh , he did .
we had a very good talk .
yeah . well , he gave you the $ 25,000 check ?
yes , i cashed it . thank you .
no ... no . that was so you &apos;d leave .
no , i don &apos;t think so .
yes , it was .
well , i don &apos;t want to go .
it &apos;s not about what you want .
yes , it is .
