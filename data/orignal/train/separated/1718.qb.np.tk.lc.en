so , i got the craziest e @-@ mail this morning .
i don &apos;t mean to burst your bubble , dude ,
but those penile enlargement pills do not work .
believe me , i know .
the e @-@ mail i got was from the office of stephen hawking .
you &apos;re kidding .
why ?
he &apos;s coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture ,
and he &apos;s looking for an engineer to help maintain
the equipment on his wheelchair .
that &apos;s amazing .
you &apos;ll be like his pit crew .
a word of caution : i would not do
your stephen hawking impression in front of him .
you &apos;re right .
i suppose that could be considered offensive .
boy , sheldon &apos;s going to freak out .
yeah , he worships hawking .
i was actually thinking about bringing him along
when i go over there so he can meet the great man .
that &apos;s really nice of you , howard .
it &apos;s no big deal .
boy , a restraining order from stephen hawking .
it &apos;ll look so nice next to the ones he &apos;s already got
from leonard nimoy , carl sagan and stan lee .

leonard , do you recall when i said
that i was going to revolutionize humanity &apos;s understanding
of the higgs boson particle , and you said ,
&quot; sheldon , it &apos;s 2 : 00 a.m. , get out of my bedroom &quot; ?
like it was ten hours ago .
what about it ?
well , i believe i &apos;ve done it .
and i &apos;m only saying &quot; believe &quot; to sound modest ,
because , sweet sam houston , i did it .
really ?
that &apos;s incredible . oh , here .
break out the math .
oh , okay , let me see this .
all right , so this particle here
is the boson moving forward in time .
now , i was thinking ...
howard , you go ahead and eat .
this isn &apos;t going to make any sense to you .
sheldon , i have a working understanding of physics .
yeah , good for you , and don &apos;t stop working on it .
are you still going to tell him
about you @-@ know @-@ who ?
yep .
are you still going to introduce him ?
not on your life .
please , please , please ,
let me meet hawking .
i told you , no .
but i said i &apos;m sorry .
no , you said , &quot; would it help if i said i &apos;m sorry ? &quot;
and you never answered me .
so who owes whom an apology now ?
sheldon , you &apos;re a condescending jerk .
why on earth would i want to do something nice for you ?
to go to jewish heaven ?
jews don &apos;t have heaven .
then to avoid jewish hell ?
have you met my mother ?
i live in jewish hell .
howard , please .
this is stephen hawking .
perhaps my only intellectual equal .
oh , you can &apos;t be serious .
try to put yourself in my place .
imagine you &apos;re the sole human being
living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs .
and then it turns out
there &apos;s another human being .
hang on .
are you saying the rest of us are dogs ?
okay , i can see you &apos;re going to take this the wrong way .
let me try again .
imagine you &apos;re the sole human being
living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps .
get out of my lab .
oh , now they &apos;re so much smarter than dogs .
have you seen them on those little bicycles ?
get out .
how about dolphins ?
out !
so , come on , how was the first day with hawking ?
it was great .
we talked about movies ...
oh ...
i showed him some card tricks ...
oh !
he even let me read a couple pages from his new book .
oh !
something got you down there , bunky ?
howard , please , i &apos;m begging you .
raj , you &apos;re our group historian .
has sheldon ever begged before ?
three times .
he begged the fox network not to cancel &lt; i &gt; firefly . &lt; / i &gt;
he begged the tnt network to cancel &lt; i &gt; babylon 5 . &lt; / i &gt;
and when he got food poisoning at the rose bowl parade ,
he begged a deity he doesn &apos;t believe in
to end his life quickly .
do you understand how important hawking is to me ?
when i was six years old ,
i dressed up as him for halloween .
you &apos;re kidding .
no , sir , no , i took my dad &apos;s desk chair ,
attached a speak &amp; spell to it
and made my sister push me up and down the block
to trick or treat .
granted most people thought i was r2 @-@ d2,
but still , i got a lot of candy .
you don &apos;t seem to be understanding
the english word &quot; no . &quot;
maybe a different language will help .
russian : &lt; i &gt; nyet . &lt; / i &gt;
chinese : &lt; i &gt; bu . &lt; / i &gt;
japanese : &lt; i &gt; iie . &lt; / i &gt;
klingon : &lt; i &gt; qo &apos; . &lt; / i &gt;
binary coded ascii : 0110111001101111 .
it &apos;s actually 01100111 .
no !
i &apos;m not asking for me ,
i &apos;m asking for hawking .
let me try gangsta : hells naw .
okay , look , how about this ?
just give him my paper on the higgs boson .
if he sees the incredible breakthrough i &apos;ve made ,
he &apos;ll reach out to me .
what if he doesn &apos;t ?
he will ; he &apos;s really smart .
that &apos;s an interesting idea .
why don &apos;t you give me a minute
to talk it over with my friends ?
how do i do that ?
you walk away .
walking away .
you do realize you own his ass right now .
i do .
you can make him do anything you want .
yeah , i know , i &apos;m just trying to figure out
how much i want to punish him .
well , don &apos;t be too mean .
hey , fellas ,
i &apos;m thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea
if anyone would like some .
i wouldn &apos;t mind a glass .
i wasn &apos;t talking to you .
bring him to his bony knees .
sheldon , come on back .
yes , yes .
what did you decide ?
i &apos;ll give your paper to professor hawking .
great , thank you !
oh , that &apos;s terrific !
but in exchange , i &apos;d like you to do a few things for me .
what kinds of things ?
are you familiar with the 12 labors of hercules ?
为消除罪业 他要为敌人完成十二项任务
of course .
you should be so lucky .
all right .
what would you like me to do first ?
well , i thought i &apos;d start you off
by polishing my belt buckles .
by all means .
when i was a boy , i would polish my mee @-@ maw &apos;s silver .
and she would entertain me with stories
about growing up in oklahoma .
interesting woman .
she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat .
that &apos;s nice .
that &apos;s a lot of belt buckles .
funny thing is , i only have one belt .
anyway , i &apos;ll let you get started .
oh , by the way ,
the little marks , uh , that look like water spots--
i tend to stand too close to the urinal , so ...
... what you &apos;re seeing there is splash back .
you make sissy on your belt buckles ?
mee @-@ maw &apos;s forks never had that .
here is a black light to check them .
and for your own peace of mind ,
you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room .
sheldon , these look great .
they &apos;re like magnificent little crowns
to hang over my magnificent little jewels .
how &apos;d you get them so shiny ?
oh , i @-@ i buffed them with turtle wax .
the man down at pep boys says from now on ,
the urine should just bead up and roll right off .
way to go the extra mile .
your mee @-@ maw would be proud .
my mee @-@ maw must never know of this .
now will you give professor hawking my paper ?
oh , my dear boy , no .
okay .
next ,
this is a sexy french maid costume
i bought for bernadette .
i thought it might spice things up
and get her to dust my room at the same time ,
but i was wrong and really wrong .
and you want me to return it for you ?
no , no , no , mon petit cherie .
what are you all staring at ?
you ever seen a man try to get a meeting
with stephen hawking before ?
it &apos;s not saturday night .
why are you doing your laundry ?
this is not my laundry .
wow , are these amy &apos;s ?
kind of trashy -- good for her .
those are howard &apos;s .
why are you washing
howard &apos;s man panties ?
because if i don &apos;t ,
he won &apos;t give my paper to stephen hawking .
he &apos;s a famous physicist .
i know , he &apos;s the wheelchair dude who invented time .
that &apos;s close enough .
i don &apos;t understand ,
why doesn &apos;t howard just introduce you to the guy ?
because he &apos;s punishing me for being a &quot; condescending jerk . &quot;
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m condescending , do you ?
well , kind of ...
oh , i &apos;m sorry , condescending means ...
i know what it means .
and yes , you love correcting people
and putting them down .
au contraire .
when i correct people i am raising them up .
you should know , i do it for you more than anyone .
come on , you do it to feel superior .
i see that twinkle in your eye
when someone says &quot; who &quot; instead of &quot; whom &quot;
or thinks the moon is a planet .
or &lt; i &gt; don quixote &lt; / i &gt; is a book about a donkey named hotay .
see , there it is ,
there &apos;s that twinkle .
well , i can &apos;t help it . that &apos;s an involuntary twinkle .
what do you want me to tell you , sheldon ?
i want you to tell me
that howard is being mean to me for no reason .
fine , howard is being mean to you for no reason .
i knew it .
what &apos;s the matter ?
every time i spend the night ,
your mom slaps me on the behind says , &quot; go get &apos; em . &quot;
it &apos;s not her fault .
she &apos;s getting hormone replacement therapy .
makes her crazy horny .
check this out , i got sheldon to wear the frenchmaid &apos;s costume .
oh , my god , that &apos;s terrible .
hey , i gave you first crack at it .
why are you doing that ?
you &apos;re being mean to him .
he &apos;s mean to me all the time .
you &apos;ve heard him tease me about not having a doctorate .
if you don &apos;t want to get teased about that ,
get a doctorate .
i have one ; they &apos;re great .
oh , come on , the man torments me .
i &apos;m just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine .
it &apos;s not the same thing .
sheldon doesn &apos;t know when he &apos;s being mean
because the part of his brain that should know
is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain .
fine , i &apos;ll just make him do a couple more things ,
then i &apos;ll stop .
no , you have to stop now .
bernadette , i want to remind you ,
you promised to take me dress shopping tomorrow !
oh , damn .
i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t make it ,
but sheldon &apos;s going to go with you !
and that &apos;s the last thing you do to him .
sheldon !
i need your help !
what is it now , mrs. wolowitz ?
it &apos;s this dress !
when i put my front in , my back pops out !
when i put my back in , my front pops out !
it &apos;s like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub !
what do you want me to do ?
we &apos;re gonna have to work as a team !
get in here , grab a handful , and start stuffing !
i &apos;m not sure how to do this .
it &apos;s easy , just pretend you &apos;re putting away a sleeping bag .
sleeping bags don &apos;t usually sweat this much , but okay .
now zip me up .
oh , if we squeeze you any tighter ,
you may turn into a diamond .
you &apos;re right , who am i kidding ?
you should have seen me when i was young , sheldon .
the fellas used to line up
and bring me boxes of candy .
why did i eat it all ? !
would you hold me ?
oh ... no , you know , i &apos;m not really the holding kind of ...
oh , guys , i just remembered .
i got your ome hawking souvenirs .
what are these ?
gears and springs from his wheelchair .
pretty cool , huh ?
wow , that &apos;s amazing .
i made an adjustment on the motor drive
and when i was putting it back together
i could not for the life of me figure out where they went .
i did it .
had to go to three clothing stores ,
but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother .
i should have sent you
to the custom car cover place in altadena .
they have her pattern on file .
humorous .
now will you please present my paper to professor hawking ?
i don &apos;t know .
oh , for heaven &apos;s sake .
i did your laundry , i pee @-@ pee @-@ proofed your belt buckles ,
i , i even sprained my wrist
helping your mother lift her bosom .
all right , sheldon ,
there &apos;s only one thing left i want you to do .
don &apos;t worry , it &apos;s an easy one .
okay .
give me a compliment .
fine .
you have very tiny hands .
no ... about my job .
i want you to tell me i &apos;m good at what i do .
you &apos;re obviously good at what you do .
well , then why are you always ripping on me ?
oh , i understand the confusion .
i have never said that you are not good at what you do .
it &apos;s just that what you do is not worth doing .
it &apos;s nicer than anything he &apos;s ever said to me .
i &apos;d take it and run .
thank you , sheldon .
now will you give my paper to hawking ?
sorry , i can &apos;t .
what , why not ?
i gave it to him three days ago .
he was really impressed .
he wants to meet you .
all right , then .
thank you , howard .
please let professor hawking know
that i &apos;m available at his earliest convenience .
i thought he might be a little more excited .
give it a second .
professor hawking ,
it &apos;s an honor and a privilege to meet you , sir .
i know .
i want to thank you for taking time to see me .
my pleasure .
i enjoyed reading your paper very much .
you clearly have a brilliant mind .
i know .
your thesis that the higgs boson is a black hole
accelerating backwards through time is fascinating .
thank you .
it just-- it came to me one morning in the shower .
that &apos;s nice .
too bad it &apos;s wrong .
what do you mean wrong ?
you made an arithmetic mistake on page two .
it was quite the boner .
no , no ... that can &apos;t be right .
i @-@ i don &apos;t make arithmetic mistakes .
are you saying i do ?
oh , no ,
no , no , of course not .
it &apos;s just , i was thinking ...
oh , gosh , golly , i made a boo @-@ boo ,
and i gave it to stephen hawking .
great , another fainter .
