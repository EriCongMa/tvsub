fate
hey . check it out .
jessica , chill . you &apos;re always like this .
it &apos;s happened before . just calm down .
don &apos;t tell me to calm down !
a $ 5.00 tip on a $ 100 service is rude .
i am sick of these people stiffing me .
yesterday some guy gave me a $ 6.00 tip .
the day before that , $ 2.00 .
she &apos;s lucky i didn &apos;t sock her in the face .
oh , jessica ...
hey , uh , let me call you back .
we &apos;re--we &apos;re closed .
hello ?
h @-@ hello ?
there you go .
thank you .
thanks .
let me call you back .
i thought you might need this .
yesterday when i saw that you were following me ,
i thought it had to be a coincidence ,
but by today , mm , probably not .
it &apos;s a long story .
well , i &apos;m a writer . i hate the short ones .
so what are you , a p.i. ?
yeah , you can call me that , sure .
who do you work for ?
i can &apos;t say . my client &apos;s very secretive .
well , you can &apos;t be with the irs .
my accountant would have called .
look--
can &apos;t be with the state department .
a spy would know better
than to leave her target &apos;s dossier on the front seat .
yeah , right .
and i know you don &apos;t work for my cigar guy
because he makes all of his deliveries straight to my door .
so , why don &apos;t you tell whoever it is
that if they want to discuss something ,
they should get out of their sandbox and call me themselves .
got it .
now , most people would ask for the coffee back .
but , being a gentleman ,
c &apos;est la vie .
oh , and , uh , get yourself and earpiece .
those things will give you brain cancer .
3 bodies have been found in reston , virginia ,
each violently stabbed , then posed ,
about a week apart .
the first two , kevin brown and rick mendoza ,
were murdered in their homes . the third one , jessica randall ,
was killed in her hair salon last night .
bold and brutal . so what did the first two victims do ?
kevin worked at a hardware store . rick was an auto mechanic .
maybe the unsub &apos;s a customer .
we should check appointment logs .
already did that .
well , gender isn &apos;t a factor .
they could all be victims of opportunity .
did they live near each other ?
3 miles apart .
they still could have been strangers .
both homes were broken into through a back window .
washington field isn &apos;t sure the unsub got into the salon .
it &apos;s high risk . maybe we &apos;re looking at a drug addict ?
but nothing was stolen .
and he took the time to re @-@ dress the victims .
strange . the unsub stabbed the victims in their original clothing
and then found clean ones to put them in .
yeah , they fit well . maybe he brought the new ones with him .
or he could have taken them from their homes .
so the unsub took the clothes the
victims were wearing as trophies .
they weren &apos;t found on the scene . it could be a ritual .
or our unsub gets high on the kill ,
then comes down , feels remorse .
the time between kills is decreasing ,
suggesting the unsub &apos;s emboldened
and getting better at victim acquisition .
then the after effects of the killing
would either exacerbate his guilt
or cause him to strike out again soon .
is mom coming down ?
i think she went for a run .
again ?
since when did she become an athlete ?
i don &apos;t know .
you don &apos;t think this is odd ?
i don &apos;t ask questions .
well , maybe that &apos;s the problem .
sky , don &apos;t start with me .
first she snaps at us , now she &apos;s running at 6 a.m. ?
something &apos;s going on .
i think she &apos;s fine .
yeah , she &apos;s just trying to get it together .
she &apos;s acting weird .
everyone &apos;s noticing .
who &apos;s everyone ? did you take a poll ?
grandma , aunt shirley ,
even kathy said something .
well , kathy gossips about everything .
so , look , just cut your mom some slack , ok ?
she &apos;s been through a lot .
besides , her physical therapist recommended exercise .
twice a day ?
sky .
i &apos;m home !
ellen . i made french toast .
oh , french toast ? sounds good . i &apos;ll be right down .
it &apos;s ok , it &apos;s ok , it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s ok .
you &apos;re ok .
&quot; change is the law of life .
&quot; and those who look only to the past or present
are certain to miss the future . &quot;
john f. kennedy .
all right , victimology . from what we can tell ,
the victims &apos; lives didn &apos;t intersect .
since one worked at a hardware store
and the others at a body shop and a hair salon ,
maybe he &apos;s targeting local businesses .
or our unsub &apos;s the common thread .
i cross @-@ checked patrons . there &apos;s no overlap .
he might have paid cash .
we should check security footage .
there &apos;s no obvious vulnerability or desirability
component to the unsub &apos;s selection criteria .
but the brutality was the same .
over a dozen stab wounds in each victim .
this feels personal .
there &apos;s definitely overkill and rage .
well , there wouldn &apos;t have been time between the kills
for planning or surveillance .
maybe our unsub knew the victims
and this is a vendetta ?
if that &apos;s the case , we need to find
the nexus between these victims .
there &apos;ll be a washington field agent to meet you when you arrive .
i &apos;m picturing tempered inlaid glass on every floor ,
which will create a greenhouse effect .
it will allow for constant moderate climates
throughout the building .
exactly . saving millions in energy costs .
so we &apos;ll be green .
and you &apos;ll save green .
we &apos;ll even thrown in heat @-@ sensing floors
which are regulated by body temperature .
oh , i love it . you did amazing work .
thank you .
i can &apos;t take all the credit .
it &apos;s that cornell education kicking in .
we &apos;ll send final jpegs friday , and if you approve ,
we can be breaking ground by the end of the month .
let &apos;s do this .
thank you so much .
you did a good job .
thank you .
what was that ?
a slam dunk .
you took my idea !
what are you talking about ?
that was the team &apos;s idea .
which i spent months developing .
the least you could have done was give me credit .
are you serious ?
you do this every time .
you act like you &apos;re having an epiphany
and everyone knows you &apos;re in your office
making dinner plans .
ellen , my job is to manage .
sometimes i remember who says what
and sometimes i don &apos;t .
what i do remember , however ,
is covering for you for 6 months
when you were out from your accident .
that has nothing to do with this .
sure it does . i wrote your reports , i finished your designs .
don &apos;t switch this around .
oh , i won &apos;t . i &apos;ll just make sure to tell bob and sam
everything i did for you when you were out on disability ,
extended 3 weeks past what the government allows .
now , if you don &apos;t mind ,
i &apos;m going to go celebrate our team &apos;s win ,
and i would love for you to join us ,
if you can break away from your little pity party .
penelope , i need you to get some intel .
oh . like nancy drew style or jason bourne ?
or i can do a &quot; ray &quot; show .
i could do like 27 % nancy , 53 % jason , or--
well , whatever you think is appropriate . i &apos;m being followed .
what , like a stalker ?
no , p.i. i just gotta find out who she &apos;s working for .
maybe somebody i put away , or ...
she could be a crazy fan .
omg , you have a groupie .
you &apos;re officially a rock star .
yeah , right . i &apos;ll send you her license plate .
and i will start spelunking .
goodbye .
p.i. ? maybe you &apos;ve got an admirer .
she had a file on me this thick .
you &apos;d be surprised how much you can print out from google .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s nothing .
yeah , well , i hope you &apos;re right .
this is why i don &apos;t get remarried .
i struck out 3 times .
i &apos;m better off just doing my job ,
writing my books , and living alone .
hey . ssa norwood .
ssa rossi .
callahan .
it &apos;s kind of a strange scene .
there &apos;s no real evidence of a break @-@ in .
looks like our unsub &apos;s highly skilled .
still frenzied .
body was found here ?
sitting up .
but it was dragged from over there .
if the unsub were a fit guy ,
he &apos;d probably be able to lift her completely off the floor .
this person couldn &apos;t , which suggests
he may be weak or injured or possibly a woman .
so the unsub again put her in something new .
there are no perforations .
so where &apos;s the vic &apos;s original clothes ?
seems like a lot of effort to expend for trophies .
bingo .
so the unsub cleaned them .
probably washed the other victims &apos; stuff as well .
we &apos;ll check their homes .
washing could be a forensic countermeasure .
a male offender would have destroyed the clothes .
our unsub &apos;s a woman .
let &apos;s get csi to sweep all the other lint filters
for trace evidence of the killer .
so jessica called you from the salon last night ?
yeah . i can &apos;t believe this .
and how was your conversation ?
did anything seem out of the ordinary ?
no . we were in the middle of a little argument ,
but jessica and i always argued .
what was yesterday &apos;s about ?
jessica went off on a client
and wanted me to say she was justified .
was she afraid that the client would retaliate ?
no . customers stiffed her all the time .
jessica had a tendency to go scorched earth
when she should have just stayed quiet .
and how did she end the conversation ?
it was quick .
but that was normal , too .
it &apos;s just usually she &apos;d call me back
and ... she didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s all right .
victim number two , rick mendoza ,
had a direct personality .
he would tell it like it is at the body shop .
and jessica had the same sort of reputation at the salon .
since all of our victims are in the service industry ,
maybe our unsub interfaced with them and had bad interactions .
someone might have seen something .
we &apos;ll keep interviewing co @-@ workers
and surrounding business owners .
i &apos;ll have garcia look at jessica &apos;s clients .
maybe somebody retaliated .
the wounds are all over the place .
rage might be an understatement .
this offender had patience .
she &apos;s been scrubbed perfectly clean .
rossi and kate think we might be looking for a female killer .
the unsub washed the victims &apos; clothes as well .
you know , this might all fall under
the umbrella of &quot; one neat aspect . &quot;
i &apos;ve heard of that . in the midst of a chaotic crime scene ,
one thing gets special attention
and is cleaned or organized .
yeah , in this case , it could mean anything related
to cleaning the victim ,
including washing their bodies or their clothes .
it &apos;s possible our unsub was recently released from an institution
where she learned regimented behavior .
yeah . we should check long @-@ term mental facilities and prisons ,
even recently discharged military personnel .
what &apos;s this ?
i pulled if off the vic &apos;s smock .
it doesn &apos;t match her dna .
so it either belongs to a client from earlier
or it could possibly be our unsub &apos;s .
thank you very much for your time .
let &apos;s get back to the bau .
hey , rossi .
we just got back . you got something ?
not about the case , but i found something mysterious .
i ran that license of the car
of the woman that &apos;s following you .
it turns out it &apos;s a rental ,
and she is far from a p.i.
she &apos;s actually a tv crime reporter in san francisco .
her name is joy struthers .
wait . crime reporter ?
yeah . and she writes her own blog ,
and last year she self @-@ published a novel
about the zodiac killer .
stop . i &apos;ve heard enough .
i think she &apos;s a fan girl .
is that another name for crazy person ?
it &apos;s a psycho fan who thinks i &apos;m comic @-@ con .
rossi , i think she just wants a blurb
for her next book .
which she needs , because the last one only sold 385 copies .
387 . i bought two &apos; cause i felt bad .
you can &apos;t diss a girl for trying .
oh , yes , i can .
thank you , penelope .
so , you got a sycophant who wants a mentor .
do you believe this ?
look on the bright side . it &apos;s not one of your exes
looking for more money .
no , it &apos;s a weirdo looking for tutelage .
i tried that once .
the woman left her manuscript all over my house .
wait . she broke in ?
6 times .
well , where is she now ?
she &apos;s doing 5 to 10 .
ooh . classy .
anything ?
lots of long brown hairs in the dryer .
they don &apos;t match the victim .
we found hair , too .
maybe the unsub &apos;s losing it .
or our victims yanked it out
while fighting for their lives .
clearly , she not forensically sophisticated .
we should run it for dna .
we might get an i.d.
or at least ethnicity and an age range .
because of the one neat aspect ,
we had garcia check out people in regimented institutions ,
but she came up empty .
did she check out d.c. , maryland , and virginia ?
the whole dmv .
washington field found the clothes
our first two victims , were stabbed in
neatly folded up in their respective closets .
well , at least our unsub &apos;s considerate .
we should keep searching .
clearly her desire to kill is unabated .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
don &apos;t have to do this .
yes , you do . you hate her . you hate her .
hello .
ellen .
yeah .
where are you ?
i need to see my boss .
now ? it &apos;s kind of late .
i know , but it &apos;s really important ,
and , um , she needs to go over some stuff with me .
this couldn &apos;t wait till morning ?
no , we gotta do it right now .
i thought the presentation was over .
yeah , it is . we have another one ,
and she--she really needs my ideas .
where are you meeting her ?
a bar--a bar .
what bar ?
michael , i &apos;ll see you when i get home .
you should have seen her .
she thought i took her idea .
isn &apos;t she the one that does nothing ?
nothing . i do everything .
i spend half of my time
reworking her generic crap .
you should cut her loose .
i talked to bob and sam about it . they said start documenting .
good .
she &apos;s just a jealous bitch .
you know what you need ?
you need to relax .
how about some wine ?
and then maybe a back rub ?
cool .
but first ...
get into something more comfortable .
greg , i &apos;m ready .
greg ?
i get it .
be more spontaneous , sarah .
we &apos;ll do it in the kitchen , then .
greg !
oh , my god !
please ... please ...
no !
please !
please don &apos;t !
no , ellen !
did you take my idea ?
yes , i did . i &apos;m so sorry .
i want to hear that louder .
yes , yes ! i stole your idea and i &apos;m sorry !
i &apos;m sorry i took your ideas .
no , no ! no , ellen !
ellen !
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
911 . what &apos;s your emergency ?
hello ?
911 , what &apos;s your emergency ?
good morning , honey .
how did it go with your boss ?
great .
she really loved my stuff .
that &apos;s good , honey .
we checked the house . no sign of a break @-@ in .
the housekeeper discovered the bodies around 8 a.m.
local p.d. also has a record
of a hang @-@ up 911 phone call last night .
but they were so swamped
they didn &apos;t send out a patrol car .
did you find the victim &apos;s old clothes ?
in the dryer .
her body was also scrubbed clean ,
whereas the boyfriend &apos;s was left bloody in the kitchen .
so sarah &apos;s the intended victim ,
which means the kills are targeted .
it sounds like the unsub
had a specific interaction with each victim .
is that more hair ?
thank you .
hmm . this time they were pulled from the root .
it was over here ,
so it probably didn &apos;t happen during the struggle .
what if the unsub &apos;s pulling her own hair out .
why would she do that ?
because she has to .
we should deliver the profile .
we believe the unsub we &apos;relooking for is a caucasian women
between the ages of 40 and 50 .
we think that she &apos;s suffering from what we call
intermittent explosive disorder .
this disorder usually occurs after a traumatic event .
it involves repeated acts of impulsive
and aggressively violent behavior .
it involves angry outbursts where the sufferer reacts
in disproportion to the situation .
in this case , the unsub lets her anger fester ,
then later lashes out . we believe she had
prior confrontations with all the victims .
after she kills or is thinking about killing ,
we believe that she &apos;s pulling her out hair out .
this is called tricotillomania ,
and it &apos;s a way that she relieves stress .
she &apos;ll appear rational at times
but be triggered by external disputes or confrontations .
her anger and remorse will make her feel like
she has two personalities .
and we believe she was hospitalized because of mental problems
but she stops taking her medication since being released .
and since she &apos;s no longer in the environment
that helped her control her urges ,
she &apos;s been triggered to start killing .
we see no indication
that these homicidal feelings in her will subside .
we believe she will continue to kill
as long as she encounters stressors that set her off .
michael , what are you doing here ?
i needed to talk to you .
well , it &apos;s gotta wait . honey , i gotta go pick up max
from basketball practice .
no , kathy &apos;s gonna take care of that .
kathy ? why kathy ?
because you &apos;re not doing well , ellen .
i &apos;m fine .
you &apos;re far from fine .
ever since the accident , you &apos;ve been acting strange .
staying out late , leaving early .
michael , i have a ton of work to do .
add that to what i found upstairs ,
i don &apos;t know what to say .
what you found ?
michael , you went through my things ?
this is your shirt .
it was in the back of your closet .
what did you do , ellen ?
oh , honey .
on the news they &apos;re talking about a woman
who &apos;s hurting people and pulling out her hair ?
did you hurt those people ?
of course not .
you weren &apos;t home last night . now your boss is dead .
did you hurt her ?
no .
so that &apos;s a coincidence ?
what did you do ?
where did you get that bruise ?
i can &apos;t help you unless you &apos;re honest with me .
oh , god .
oh , michael .
i killed them .
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know .
i just did it .
i tried to stop and i can &apos;t .
i know . i know .
listen , we &apos;re gonna get you help .
i &apos;m gonna be by your side .
oh , michael .
i &apos;m right here , ok ?
oh , michael , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening to me .
you &apos;re sick .
we &apos;re gonna get through this .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know .
we have to tell the police .
oh , no , michael , no , i can &apos;t . no .
they need to know the truth .
michael , no . are you listening to me ? no !
are you listening , michael ? !
oh , my god ! ellen .
help me .
ok , come on .
get out , out , out .
oh , my god .
what the hell happened ? !
dad ?
i can explain .
dad !
come on , let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go !
ok , i know that we said we weren &apos;t looking for an addict .
what about somebody who was in rehab ,
is now off drugs and out ?
theory ?
same structured behavior . similar routines
similar routines to being institutionalized .
no , there &apos;s no one who fits the profile
in any drug rehab center .
can you check surrounding areas ?
i checked every state .
what else could have caused her i.e.d ?
frontal lobe damage from a head injury of some sort .
then maybe she had to undergo inpatient physical therapy .
a rehabilitation program
would have exposed her to regimented behavior .
and the moment that she was released
or started driving her car ,
her rage could have been triggered .
and check physical rehab centers as well .
on it .
you &apos;re kidding .
what ?
nothing . i &apos;ll be right back .
what the hell are you doing here ?
i can explain .
you come to my job ?
i need to talk to you .
you &apos;re crazy . you &apos;re not a p.i.
you &apos;re a reporter trying to be a novelist .
how the hell did you even get in here ?
i got a press pass .
press pass ?
i had to see you .
look , if i catch you at my work again ,
you &apos;ll be writing an opus from behind bars .
security !
no , please don &apos;t do this .
escort her out of here .
please .
out .
i &apos;m your daughter !
i have checked all local rehab facilities
for recently released patients that fit the profile .
i &apos;m still coming up empty .
and what about private or
hmo @-@ run physical rehab centers ?
wait ...
uh , uh , ok , 10 months ago
a woman named ellen connell
was in a horrible car accident
that put her in an hmo rehab center for 4 months .
what happened ?
her car collided with two teen girls .
how bad was ellen hurt ?
so bad that she had hundreds of days of physical therapy
due to head injuries . she was released a month ago ,
a week before the first killing .
she must have had frontal lobe damage
that destroyed her impulse control .
and since she &apos;s developed i.e.d ,
she &apos;s no longer able able to control
her bursts of rage and the violence that follows .
so she &apos;s fine until she gets mad .
but after she kills and her anger subsides ,
she reverts back to her normal behavior .
is there any overlap of the victims ?
she works at the same
architectural firm as her latest victim .
and she specializes in doors and windows .
that &apos;s how she was able to
get in and out of the crime scenes .
she also ordered a bunch of wigs
and lives two blocks away
from the third victim &apos;s hair salon .
all right , send the address to our phones .
my mom is hayden montgomery .
you married her in &apos; 84 in paris .
i know who hayden is .
she was a diplomat ,
you were on temporary duty with the fbi .
hayden would have told me if she was pregnant .
ok , my dad --
my stepdad told me about you
when he was dying of cancer ,
and it forced my mom to finally come clean .
how can i believe you ?
first you tell me you &apos;re a p.i. and now this ?
ok , i was scared .
look , you can even call my mom .
she &apos;s still in paris .
hey , rossi . we gotta go .
we &apos;ll straighten this out later .
leave your info at the front desk .
so why was she here ? what did she want ?
nothing .
you ok ?
yeah . i &apos;m fine .
mom , where are we going ?
shut up .
why are you doing this ?
just drive .
we need to go to 482 crow &apos;s nest lane .
who lives there ?
it doesn &apos;t matter . just move .
got a victim down here .
dave ?
anything ?
abby benson . one of the girls
ellen was in the accident with .
willing and able .
garcia , we &apos;re outside of ellen connell &apos;s office .
check her ip address and see if she was trying to reach
an abby benson recently .
looks like she followed her on twitter
the moment she got out of rehab .
she checks her instagram daily .
how about today ?
pop goes the weasel .
she googled abby &apos;s address
from her phone 10 minutes ago .
it &apos;s her endgame .
thanks , garcia .
get out .
get out !
mom , what are we doing here ?
if we hurry , we can do this .
whose house is this ?
would you stop talking !
hi , may i help you ?
yes . i &apos;m ellen connell ,
the one your daughter hit with her car .
excuse me ?
oh , my god !
mommy , please !
what &apos;s going on ?
who are you ? !
the woman whose life you destroyed .
just admit you were wrong .
the accident was your fault !
i &apos;m the one in the wheelchair . you hit me !
i didn &apos;t hit you !
yes , you did . you hit her and you killed her friend .
mom , she &apos;s telling the truth .
no . had she been paying attention ,
none of this would have happened .
i had the right of way .
the ground was wet .
mom , please -- - shut up !
whose side are you on ?
you ruined my life .
washed it into the gutter .
i &apos;ve lost everything because of you !
put the knife down !
get out .
put it down , ellen .
you don &apos;t want to kill her .
you don &apos;t want to kill any of them .
your brain is tricking you , ellen .
you have frontal lobe damage from the accident .
your reasoning is off .
no . i &apos;m fine .
you &apos;re not fine , and you know it .
it &apos;s why you &apos;re pulling your hair out , ellen .
please just go !
ellen , she &apos;s your daughter . look at her .
now , it &apos;s not too late to fix this .
she and max are all that &apos;s left .
don &apos;t hurt them , too .
this isn &apos;t me .
we know that , ellen .
just put the knife down .
mom ...
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m jennifer .
i am going to pick up your brother
and take the both of you to your aunt &apos;s house .
this is my fault .
no . no , don &apos;t say that .
i knew there was something wrong .
i should have done more .
no one ever sees this coming .
we &apos;re gonna get your mom help .
she &apos;s gonna need your support .
ok ?
do you think the jury will be sympathetic ?
maybe . there is proof
that the accident altered her brain .
excuse me .
what do you mean , she checked out ?
yeah . that &apos;s what her credit card said . she left an hour ago .
do you know where she went ?
well , check the airports , train stations .
ok . ok . uh ...
she bought a plane ticket that leaves at 9 : 54 tonight .
dulles or national ?
great . thanks .
what &apos;s going on ?
i need a car .
ok . is everything all right ?
it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t want to be married .
i just don &apos;t want to stay here .
my job is here , david .
and i &apos;m not asking you to leave it .
all right . you &apos;re all set .
thanks .
hey , it &apos;s me .
how are you ?
i &apos;m good .
are you sure ?
you don &apos;t sound all that good .
hey , i &apos;m fine .
joy ?
what -- what are you doing here ?
you flew all the way out here to meet me .
i figured you had a few questions .
i know i do .
and if your first question is ,
will you please just leave me alone ,
i respect that .
why didn &apos;t you stay with her ?
your mom and i had a complicated relationship .
it was a whirlwind summer in paris ,
and when it was over ,
the reality was i was moving up in the fbi
and she was a diplomat .
that &apos;s not good enough .
look , i wanted to take over the world ,
and she was already doing it .
she was meeting with dignitaries ,
traveling to different countries .
and i couldn &apos;t handle it .
and instead of manning up ,
i pushed her away .
i told her i wasn &apos;t sure i wanted to be married .
but honestly , i j -- i just wanted to catch up .
you were the love of her life .
i didn &apos;t believe that .
i know what i said to you earlier ,
that if your mom was pregnant ,
she would have told me .
but the truth is , she wouldn &apos;t have said anything .
