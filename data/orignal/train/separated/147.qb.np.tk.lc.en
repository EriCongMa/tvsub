i &apos;m betting it &apos;s about the junior committee for the whitney
tripp &apos;s fiancee promised to get me on
okay , just wait a minute , young lady ,
you &apos;re gonna have to get serious about your future
murnee is already on the board of four chairty and two museums

and he happens to own me a favor
cyrus saved jr &apos;s life in vietnam
oh , i &apos;m sorry , but just because i lost yale
doesn &apos;t not mean i &apos;m wasting my time at non @-@ ivey
reading bloved 6 times and experienmenting with lesbianism

waldorf women are not socilized
you can just set those down there , please
daugter returns , how was spain
i &apos;m sure , with poppy dacing on table tops in barcelona ,
some amazing nude alongside with alcohol
more like me , and poppy and her boyfriend gabriel on the coast ,
i just read , and ate and swam
so there was nude sunbathing
is my mom around
i haven &apos;t seen her , but i have been occuped .
last night &apos;s entertainments
she &apos;s synchronised swimmer , can hold her breath for 5 minutes
sure you found a way of get over blair then
but then i realized that i &apos;m a 17 year old billionaire
tonight i have a date with
by the way , i saw poppy lifting at the bar last week
it &apos;s funny how she can be there yet still be in spain with you .
did i tell you you &apos;re beautiful
nate archibald , are you trying to seduce me on church property
come on , let &apos;s go
can you pretend not to see me behind carolin kennday ,
she maybe american roality , but that woman is a true ruff .
sure
hey , tripp asked to go lunch with me , said it was important
but i think he &apos;s just gonna talk about her ex @-@ girlfriend in whitehouse
fine , i &apos;ll come by before dinner , i hope that &apos;s not your big suprise
oh yeah
i have to think a way to think marunne with the the whitney committee
i got in to columbia
what
i got in to columbia
what were you talking about
nothing , that &apos;s amazing , i didn &apos;t even know you applyed
i wanted to see if i can get in without my family &apos;s help , you know ?
it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m so happy for you .
so that means no yale ?
no , honestly , i &apos;m--i &apos;m torn .
blair. it was so sweet of you to come .
yes , it @-@ it &apos;s going to be so beautiful .
i @-@ i have some disappointing news .
the whitney junior committee felt
felt you were too new on the scene .
they chose elizabeth instead .
your bridesmaid ?
give it time .
when it comes to these things ,
it takes a while to start to matter .
hey , if it makes you feel any better ,
maureen had to pick her bridesmaids
from a list provided by my grandfather .
hey , i better go. the rehearsal &apos;s starting .
oh. okay .
i &apos;ll just wait here ... with the rest of the commoners .
is that the , uh , science fair project ?
yep. we &apos;re tracking air quality on plant growth .
one of these was grown in our apartment ,
and the other was grown in wes &apos; country house .
apparently a tree does not grow in brooklyn .
i better take off. call you later ?
yeah .
well , i hope for the sake of science that
that relationship is strictly professional .
of course .
but i &apos;m working on it .
no , i get it. rent trumps art .
well , let me know if you change your mind .
nobody wants to buy art right now .
look , i &apos;m the one with the expensive yale tuition .
please let me help. there &apos;s gotta be a job on craigslist
that doesn &apos;t involve dealing or nudity .
dan , i have it under control .
your priority is school . i &apos;m off to lily &apos;s .
she wants to go shopping for a table , a lamp .
i &apos;m not sure. bye. bye .
good luck .
i don &apos;t know he &apos;s being so stubborn about this .
you know , wes &apos; mom owns a catering company .
catering ? that definitely was not on the top of my list ,
but , i mean , yeah ,
if you--if you-- if you don &apos;t mind asking ...
not at all , because then i can ask him to come to dinner
with me as a thanks for being so cool to my brother .
hello , blair .
good to see you .
you , too , mr. van der bilt .
the wedding is going to be lovely .
blair , it &apos;s reached my ears that nate has been accepted to columbia .
has he spoken to you of his intentions ?
not in so many words .
but i do know he &apos;s very proud of having gotten in on his own .
as he should be .
my grandson values your opinion .
perhaps you could show him that yale is the appropriate choice .
i ... think this is a decision he needs to make himself .
tell me , what are your plans for next year ?
i know you put off college .
any word from the junior committee for the whitney ?
actually ... they didn &apos;t accept me .
ah . i think that must be some kind of mistake .
i &apos;ll call agnes chismer immediately
and clear that right up .
really ?
for a friend of my grandson ,
there &apos;s nothing i wouldn &apos;t do .
yale is an amazing school .
and ... nate would look dashing in bulldog blue .
and i want to be a bridesmaid .
i think , uh , she might have room for one more .
why did i give dorota the weekend off ?
ever since she and vanya fell in love ,
all she thinks about is herself .
hello ?
yes , this is cyrus rose .
this is serena van der woodsen .
i think i need a lawyar
how did antique shopping turn into shoe shopping ?
well , my darling ,
all shopping eventually leads to shoe shopping .
if only people felt that way about art .
you &apos;re thinking about dan &apos;s tuition .
uh , mid @-@ range collectors just aren &apos;t buying right now .
well , you never know when things will turn around .
now who says that these are not art
hey , mom. nice shoes .
could you give us a moment ?
welcome back .
thanks .
mom , i know you &apos;re upset .
no , i &apos;m furious .
first you trash the apartment , then you run away to spain .
i &apos;m sorry .
i , um , i &apos;ve just-- i &apos;ve been feeling really lost .
oh , spare me , serena. the only thing that is lost is
your sense of responsibility and consideration .
it seems to me like the old serena is back ,
and i &apos;m not very happy to see her .
so you might want to take your coat off ,
because you &apos;re grounded .
s. ! you &apos;re back from spain !
yeah . i just landed .
hey , uh , are you home ?
no. more like avoiding it .
my mom and cyrus are hosting passover .
i thought firstborns were supposed to be spared .
oh , so--so you &apos;re not gonna be at the apartment all day ?
i &apos;m getting a dress fitted at reem acra ,
and then nate and i are going to his cousin &apos;s rehearsal dinner .
s. , i &apos;m one of the chosen ones .
i was wandering the bass @-@ ian desert
and now i &apos;ve reached the van der bilt promised land .
that &apos;s great. um , listen , i have to run some errands ,
but let &apos;s talk later , okay ?
i thought maureen was only having five bridesmaids .
it was kind of last minute .
and i think a little higher on the hem .
so i &apos;m gonna need a couple minutes
to practice my tray balancing .
i &apos;ve never done this before .
although i have a feeling i @-@ i &apos;ll be a tray @-@ balancing wunderkind .
are you gonna do this nervous talking thing all night ?
it &apos;s cool . i just need to know .
no , i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t tell my dad i took this job ,
and i @-@ i feel so bad keeping it from him ,
but , you know , he gets so defensive .
i &apos;ll take that as a &quot; yes . &quot;
oh , no , no , no , no .
good. you &apos;re here .
i just ran out to buy some candles .
i don &apos;t understand why we just can &apos;t light some votives .
you look familiar .
have you worked for me before ?
i did call them , and they cannot send over a replacement .
they are absolutely overextended .
mrs. waldorf , i &apos;m sure that between corrine
and--and dorota ...
dorota has the weekend off .
and i absolutely need two servers .
cyrus &apos; mother &apos;s coming , and she hates me .
i have never thrown a seder before .
i don &apos;t even know how to say half the words
in this prayer book that &apos;s named for lieberman &apos;s wife .
she , uh , she &apos;s hadassah .
the--i think the prayer book is called haggadah .
see ? no , you cannot leave .
with all due respect , i @-@ i don &apos;t--
i don &apos;t feel comfortable serving knishes to blair .
but blair won &apos;t be here .
and you don &apos;t serve knishes at passover .
i &apos;ll double your pay ...
for both of you .
i could really use the money .
fine .
great. here are the linens .
put one of these at every place .
cyrus ? cyrus , i think the brisket &apos;s burnin &apos; .
oh , no. not at all , mrs. chismer .
we all make mistakes .
so i &apos;ll see you tuesday at the whitney ?
so ...
i &apos;ve been thinking about this whole college thing .
i &apos;m going to columbia .
okay .
oh , maybe it &apos;s just my old prejudice speaking ,
but , um , yale--
yale only accepted me because of my grandfather .
i don &apos;t want to owe him or my family anything .
after tonight , we &apos;re done with them .
oh , b . , too bad you weren &apos;t invited
to nate and tripp &apos;s lunch , &apos; cause whatever happened ,
it looks like you &apos;re the one paying .
cyrus !
your mother &apos;s here .
god , where is that man ?
i can certainly look into the legalities of it ,
but ... i think you should tell your mother .
we &apos;re--we &apos;re not in a good place right now .
i don &apos;t think i could go up to her and say ,
&quot; sorry , but i sort of got married in spain .
&quot; but don &apos;t worry .
cyrus is helping me get a quickie annulment . &quot;
she &apos;s your mother . sh--
cyrus
excuse me .
sorry . you what ?
two days into the trip ,
poppy and gabriel get in this huge fight ,
and then she just leaves , abandoning me and gabriel .
and so i @-@ i stayed around to keep him company .
well , you did a bang @-@ up job .
dan , please . gabriel and poppy were over ,
and it &apos;s not like either one of us planned this .
this--this thing between us just happened ,
and we couldn &apos;t stop it .
this &quot; thing &quot; was a marriage .
what were you thinking ?
i don &apos;t know . i @-@ i wasn &apos;t .
but i don &apos;t even know if i am married .
that &apos;s what cyrus is trying to figure out .
how does one not know if one is married ?
well , there was a dinner ,
and then we had a lot of rioja
and then dancing and then more rioja
and then we took off our clothes and went swimming in the ocean .
okay , skip that part .
yeah . yeah , um , so--so the next thing i know ,
gabriel is just screaming , &quot; i love you ! i love you ! &quot;
and he &apos;s banging on this church door ,
trying to wake up a priest and--
o @-@ okay--okay , so there was a priest .
did you say &quot; i do &quot; ?
well , i @-@ i said &quot; si &quot;
i don &apos;t know . it w @-@ was all in spanish .
it was--it was crazy .
you &apos;re smiling .
what ?
you ran off to spain with a guy you barely know .
you got married and you &apos;re-- a little bit--you &apos;re smiling .
no , i woke up the next morning ,
and i thought , &quot; what have i done ? this is crazy . &quot;
and i got on the next flight out
and here i am talking to cyrus .
you &apos;re a--you &apos;re like-- you &apos;re a wife .
no , i &apos;m not. maybe i am .
a @-@ are you jealous ?
serena , we were together for a year ,
and we didn &apos;t make it to junior prom .
you &apos;re with this guy for less than a month ,
and you get married , so i mean , yeah ,
it &apos;s a little bit insulting .
i @-@ i have to-- i have to get back to work .
wait . wait . are you serving eleanor &apos;s seder ?
no .
sort of . i mean , yes .
yes ...
you &apos;re the wife of the landed gentry ,
and i &apos;m a cater waiter at a seder .
dan , wait .
nate , tell me what &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s fine .
listen , i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m just glad you &apos;re here , okay ?
you know , now might not be a good time
to say anything to your grandfather about columbia .
well , that should be easy , since i &apos;m not gonna speak to him .
is there a problem , blair ?
no . no problem . i just need a few more minutes .
oh , eleanor , thank you for doing this .
please . i was very happy that you invited yourself .
cyrus &apos; mother-- she hates me .
another friendly face is always welcome .
hello , rufus .
hey .
oh , do you know that ...
you &apos;ll find out .
that &apos;s allan ievy , the art collector .
he &apos;s the guy who put a monet in his bathroom . i--oh , no .
well , he &apos;s an old friend of cyrus &apos; .
you &apos;ve been saying the mid @-@ range art market is dead , so i thought
it might be nice for you to meet a few high @-@ end collectors .
lil , i appreciate you trying to help ,
but i am not fawning over an ass like allan ievy
just to make a sale .
oh , god .
dan , what are you doing here ? um , i &apos;m j-- i &apos;m just here &apos; cause--
because i invited him .
oh . lovely .
i &apos;m sorry that i snuck out , mom , but i had to see dlair .
she invited me to seder , so i invited dan .
though blair is now strangely nowhere to be seen .
well , lucky for you ,
i don &apos;t want to cause a scene at eleanor &apos;s .
we &apos;ll talk about this later .
dan , you &apos;re dressed just like a cater waiter .
yeah , well , y @-@ you go for a classic look with a black tie
and a white shirt , and that &apos;s what you get .
serena , what are you doing here ?
blair invited her .
strange . blair made it absolutely clear
that she wasn &apos;t going to be here , but please stay .
daniel , would you go downstairs and get the kosher wine
and could you please make yourself
a little more presentable ?
that was sort of rude .
yeah , you know what ? i &apos;m just gonna go with it .
attaboy .
drinks ?
yeah .
i would have invited you to the loft ,
but the only chef we have there is my dad ,
and his specialties are waffles and embarrassing me .
do you want the top hat or the race car ?
what , do you want the shoe ?
this isn &apos;t the same girl i used to see
hanging out on the steps of the met .
yeah , well , people change .
great .
good evening .
if you hear screams , don &apos;t be alarmed . we &apos;re fine .
i think i &apos;ll be the thimble .
rufus &apos; gallery is in williamsburg .
you should move your gallery to the city .
williamsburg is already over .
i didn &apos;t realize a whole neighborhood could be over .
my friends , it &apos;s time for the seder to begin .
dan , uh , i need you to know that i &apos;m really sorry .
dan , we need matzo !
serena , being eleanor &apos;s bitch boy is about all i can take
right now , so i ... i really don &apos;t need your pity .
okay , but just please understand that what happened
between me and gabriel has nothing to do with you .
uh , yeah , sure .
but a person doesn &apos;t just go off and suddenly get married .
you &apos;re clearly reacting to something .
dan !
i gotta get matzo .
tripp .
blair .
did you say something to nate ?
he feels lucky , you know , that you two are back together .
he told me how much you &apos;ve both changed . is that true ?
yes .
of course .
we &apos;ve changed a lot .
well , be good to him , okay ?
what did you tell him ?
well , good evening .
oh , no .
most of you know me .
i &apos;m nate archibald , tripp &apos;s cousin .
when tripp asked me to be the best man in his wedding ,
i was a little bit surprised , to say the least .
but i guess grandfather told him to choose me
and that was that , so ...
but we all know how important family is
to william van der bilt . but what we don &apos;t know are
the many secret ways he helps us all out .
for instance , today i discovered
he was the one who had my father investigated by the authorities .
and if he cares so much about family ,
then why did he destroy mine ?
so i guess the lesson here ...
tripp , old buddy ...
is watch your back .
to family .
uh @-@ oh , b.
looks like you hitched your wagon to a falling star .
can i help you ?
yes , i &apos;m gabriel . i &apos;m looking for serena .
baruch atah ay dios mio .
this passover is gonna get its own spanish inquisition .
so passover is a holiday that celebrates
the jewish people &apos;s flight from slavery to freedom .
you need to come to the foyer .
dan , i know you &apos;re upset ,
but now is not a good time . cyrus is about to pray . ...
we light the candles .
you really need to come out there , like , right now .
normally we do this before sunset ,
but i won &apos;t tell if you don &apos;t .
excuse me .
baruch atah adonai eloheinu melech ha &apos;olam ...
what is so important ?
oh , no .
exactly .
gabriel , wh @-@ what-- what are you doing here ?
how can you ask me that ? i woke up and you were gone .
not even a note .
but how did you even find me ?
i called your apartment .
the guy who answered said you &apos;d probably be here .
he also asked me if i had any hash .
this is obviously between the two of you , so ...
no , you &apos;re not leaving .
please . i can call you ,
but you have to go now .
no , i &apos;m not going anywhere .
we have to talk. you owe me at least that .
please , gabriel , don &apos;t .
why won &apos;t you even talk to me ?
i mean , after everything that we &apos;ve
because dan is my boyfriend .
we got in a fight before i left for spain
and once i got there ,
i got a little carried away ,
but no matter what , i had to come back .
dan was my first love , and nothing can change that .
yeah , it , uh , it &apos;s true. it &apos;s true .
i love serena .
no matter what crazy thing she does ,
uh , i @-@ i will always love her .
i &apos;m sorry , but , serena ,
you &apos;ve never mentioned him before .
well , i &apos;m sure i had to come up at least once .
at any point ?
gabriel , i will call you , but you do have to leave .
this is a family dinner .
dan , cyrus says that we are missing a lamb bone .
oh , hello .
is this another one of your friends ?
yeah , um , sort of , but he &apos;s leaving .
i apologize . i didn &apos;t mean to interrupt your evening .
oh , not at all , not at all . would you like to join us ?
we &apos;re having a seder .
no , no , i &apos;m sure he can &apos;t .
no , no . i &apos;d love to meet the people in serena &apos;s life .
perhaps it &apos;ll help me better understand her .
wonderful .
there &apos;s even an empty seat .
it &apos;s for elijah , but you can take it .
you are in serious danger of losing your tip .
did you know about this ?
what ? no , of course not .
you have five minutes to fix it .
did you really turn in the captain ?
before you take a stand on principle ,
remember what you have at stake .
or do you plan to spend next year sewing buttons
at your mother &apos;s atelier ? now go .
then we eat the afikomen ,
say the blessing after the meal ,
sing a few songs , and then we &apos;re done .
so as soon as everyone has some wine , we &apos;ll begin .
wait . we haven &apos;t started .
uh , i &apos;m sorry . are you the gabriel
as in the gabriel that was in spain with poppy and my daughter ?
yes . in fact
cyrus , this wine is delicious .
oh , well , thank you , dear .
we &apos;re not supposed to drink it until the blessing ,
but , uh , we &apos;ll make an exception this time .
rufus , do you represent any artists worth my attention ?
all of my artists are worth attention .
otherwise i wouldn &apos;t represent them .
why is he serving the wine ? isn &apos;t he supposed to be ...
he is just helpful . that &apos;s all .
dan , baby , come sit down right here next to me , please .
oh , well , that &apos;s where we just moved elijah .
but never mind .
eleanor , you don &apos;t mind if he joins us , do you ?
at this point , why not ? we &apos;re not eating any time soon .
oh , no . you two haven &apos;t--
now we will say the kiddush , or prayer for the first cup .
i &apos;ll say this in english because as i look around this table ,
i most of our guests are not speakers of hebrew .
oh , you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
we praise you , adonai , our god ,
ruler of the universe , who creates the fruit of the vine ...
what ? do you not like ?
have we done this before ?
i thought you &apos;d remember .
last year , after sleeping beauty ...
i need to get a drink .
no ! ugh .
yes !
not again .
that takes you right to my property--marvin gardens .
pay up. what a shock. the girl from brooklyn &apos;s a renter .
don &apos;t you have a guest to attend to ?
it appears i already did , a year ago .
i probably should have noticed in the elevator .
how many women can put their legs behind their ...
hey , um , do you wanna go for a walk ?
okay . sure .
i &apos;ll just meet you at the elevator .
okay .
you know , just &apos; cause you &apos;re bored with your own life
doesn &apos;t mean you have to make everyone around you miserable .
for your information , you don &apos;t live here yet .
please. after what you did
at the kiss on the lips party last year ,
like i would ever live in the same house as you .
you know , you &apos;re lucky i didn &apos;t tell my dad ,
because if i did , he &apos;d make lily choose--us or you--
and i wonder who she &apos;d pick .
do you really think i care if lily kicks me out ?
yeah , i do , because you lost blair ,
and now she &apos;s dating your best friend .
so therefore the only human contact that you have
that you don &apos;t pay for is the people in this house .
knowing you , you &apos;ll screw that up , too .
are you coming back ?
you can let yourself out .
nate .
blair , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m so sorry .
i should have told you .
it &apos;s fine. are you okay ?
yeah .
i mean , no , i &apos;m not .
you know , i trusted him .
i mean , was i wrong ?
no .
you &apos;re wonderful .
i &apos;m gonna go get my coat . then we can go .
okay .
nathaniel .
i did turn your father in ,
but only after i confronted him and begged him to stop .
when he denied it to my face ,
i warned him that i would take action .
finally ...
to prevent further damage to you and your mother ,
i called the s.e.c.
and i &apos;d do it again .
why couldn &apos;t you have just told me this ?
is that what you want , nathaniel--the truth ?
yes . i &apos;m just so tired of people lying to me
and going behind my back .
okay .
let &apos;s start again. nothing but the truth .
but in that case ,
there &apos;s something you should know .
watch out , b .
it seems like just when you got it right , van der bilt is gonna do you wrong
that was the washing of the hands ,
also called the title 88 of the new york city health code .
next we have the dipping of the vegetable .
you mean we &apos;re finally going to get to eat something ?
oh , yes , parsley .
so are you two really together again ?
so if , uh , corrine would get everyone the salt water for dipping
wait . i &apos;m sorry. why doesn &apos;t everybody
seem to know the two of you are back together ?
and what kind of daughter doesn &apos;t
shh. there &apos;s praying about to happen .
but i &apos;m so sorry , cyrus , when did ...
that &apos;s fine .
when did this happen ? you just broke up two months ago .
i thought you said you broke up right before spain .
it &apos;s complicated .
eleanor &apos;s friends are talking during the seder .
they &apos;re both of our friends , mother .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i just don &apos;t believe he &apos;s your boyfriend .
first of all , he &apos;s dressed like a waiter .
i think it &apos;s kind of a classic look .
well , he is my boyfriend ,
and we are very happy together .
serena , i am so sorry , cyrus .
no . no . go right ahead .
what is going on ?
i &apos;m a cater waiter .
and not a very good one .
wait . what ?
i didn &apos;t want you to know ,
so we were pretending that we &apos;re back together .
she &apos;s just trying to be a good friend , really .
i &apos;m sorry . mr. rose , mrs. waldorf , i &apos;m very sorry .
apology accepted . now take your parsley ...
where &apos;s corrine with the salt water ?
hold on . i &apos;m sorry .
is this you trying to help with college ?
i know you didn &apos;t want me to , dad ,
but i couldn &apos;t do nothing .
by the way , serena and i may not be together ,
but i do care about her very much .
now who needs more wine ?
serena , a word ?
all right , we &apos;ll skip the bitter herbs .
uh , moving on to the matzo .
hey , you know what ?
i &apos;m , uh , i need some air .
i &apos;m gonna walk home , so you just go ahead , okay ?
nate , what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;m proud of what you did back there .
i thought you were , too .
did you tell my grandfather
you would convince me to go to yale
in exchange for him making you a bridesmaid ?
i can explain .
that &apos;s great , you know ?
first my grandfather sells my father out ,
and then you sell me out for a picture in the style section .
no . but i didn &apos;t !
i mean , god , i did ,
but then i realized when he asked me again--
no , you know what ?
i actually thought this time would be different .
but you &apos;re just-- you &apos;re just the same girl you always were .
no , i &apos;m not ! i ...
i was just scared about next year and us .
nate , please give me another chance .
i want to trust you .
okay ? but ...
i can &apos;t think of a single reason why i should .
the car will take you home .
so this is how it &apos;s going to be ?
the day is not even over , and you &apos;ve already defied me
about your grounding ,
caused a scene at eleanor &apos;s seder ...
it wasn &apos;t a scene .
yes , it was , right out of the old serena playbook .
you could have thrown in a few boys from the lacrosse team ,
and it would have been
the constance mother @-@ daughter luncheon all over again .
you have been so good the last two years .
well , i can &apos;t live like that anymore .
why not ?
mom , i know that i have hurt you and eric and blair .
i &apos;ve done a lot of things that i &apos;m not proud of ,
and i don &apos;t wanna go back to that , but it wasn &apos;t all bad .
i miss the good parts . i miss feeling free ,
feeling like i can do something just because i want to ,
and there has to be a balance .
well , of course there does .
but if every time i make a mistake ,
you look at me like i &apos;m a bad person ,
then how am i supposed to find that ?
oh , sweetheart , i could never think of you as a bad person .
you got into brown .
the letter came while you were away .
i got into brown ?
yeah .
congratulations .
and i do trust you .
i got into brown .
yes .
now what are you gonna do about gabriel ?
what do you mean ?
oh , please . he was a little too upset about dan
to , um , be just a friend .
i don &apos;t know . i , um , i like him ,
but it &apos;s kind of a mess .
sometimes those messes can be fun .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re talking about that hot guy from dinner ,
he just left .
gabriel .
gabriel .
you wanted me to leave . i left .
i &apos;m sorry that i lied , but you scared me ,
showing up here like that .
i am just not ready to be married .
is that what you think is going on ?
well , yeah ,
we were in a church , and there was a priest .
at least i think he was a priest . i don &apos;t know .
i drank a lot of rioja , but ...
of course we &apos;re not married .
i don &apos;t even know if that was the priest i woke up .
it could have been the gardener .
r ... really ?
really .
we were just having fun , doing something crazy .
wow . well , that &apos;s a relief .
so that waiter &apos;s not your boyfriend ?
no .
what about me ?
serena .
ah , cruel fate .
just as serena van der woodsen is falling in love ,
blair waldorf is falling apart .
look , i told you ,
i &apos;m not in the mood .
good . neither am i.
was it stupid of me to think blair changed ?
yes .
so she &apos;s just ...
the way she is .
i mean , it &apos;s stupid for you to want her to be anything
other than she is .
anyway , blair is changing .
how do you know ?
because she could have had me .
she chose you .
now she just needs someone to believe in her .
time for a refill .
hey . i &apos;ll get it .
thanks .
your father and i are heading out ,
and i know what you were trying to do for serena .
you &apos;re a good friend .
i &apos;m not a very good cater waiter .
but i &apos;m a good salesman .
you sold allan levy a painting .
it also gave me an idea of something else i should sell--
the gallery .
oh , rufus .
dad , come on .
when i started out , i was selling to young couples ,
kids who had no money but loved art ,
and somehow , over time , that changed .
and tonight i realized i just don &apos;t love doing this anymore .
and if i &apos;m really honest ,
i haven &apos;t for some time .
oh , well , okay . what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m not sure .
but i &apos;m excited to find out .
see you at home .
i can &apos;t believe i sold out nate to be the next jackie o.
yeah , i always pictured you as the next hillary .
except that i &apos;d win .
what am i gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;ll figure something out .
besides , who wants to be
on the junior committee for the whitney anyway ?
do you think i care about that ?
i lost nate . i deserve to be alone .
and who was that tall snack you were devouring outside ?
oh , uh , that is ...
a long story .
blair ?
there is someone downstairs who wants to speak with you .
i was pretty awful to cyrus this morning .
i should go apologize .
b. , i &apos;m really happy to be home .
archibald .
i thought my dad would be here ,
we &apos;re supposed to meet up to go home .
how was your date ?
good .
great , actually .
i never apologized
for what happened last year .
i deeply regret my actions of that night .
if you ever do move in here ...
i &apos;ll make sure i &apos;m not around .
cyrus .
i apologize about missing the seder
and being so snotty about n.y.u.
can you forgive me ?
well , that &apos;s why god invented yom kippur .
and when you said you could call in a favor at n.y.u ...
did you mean it ?
well , i carried j.r. on my back
for five hours through the jungle .
but i can only get you an interview .
it &apos;s gonna be up to you to wow him .
thank you .
sounds like we &apos;ll both be in the city .
nate ?
well , who did you think i was talking about ?
blair , i , uh ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
this is gabriel . leave a message .
hey , gabriel . it &apos;s me .
uh , i @-@ i just wanted to say
that i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen with us , but , um ...
i &apos;m really glad you came back for me .
okay. um , that &apos;s it .
i @-@ i will talk to you tomorrow .
on passover , we ask , why is it that this night
is different from any other night ?
but who are we kidding ?
tell me everything .
tonight &apos;s no different from the rest .
