第一季 第四集
well , you can &apos;t be worse than the guys i do know .
well , our kids were bound to meet.it &apos;s a small island .
are you sure it &apos;s not some ploy ,
your using my daughter to get to me now that your wife left you ?
do you ever feel like
our whole lives have beenplanned out for us ,
that we &apos;re just gonna end up like our parents ?
man , that &apos;s a dark thought .
your mother and i didn &apos;t work this hard
so you can just make things upas you go along .
it &apos;s a facility for the disturbed or addicted .
the question is , what do you do now ?
i was thinking ... total social destruction ?
and here i thought you were getting soft .
it &apos;s because of their excellent program
that a student here with ustoday is clean and sober ...
at least , for now .
she &apos;s in rehab ?
no , it &apos;s not her.it &apos;s her brother who &apos;s there .
i know i said some things about you and your world ,
and i &apos;m sorry .
why did you leave without saying good @-@ bye ?
i didn &apos;t know how to be your friend after what i did .
i &apos;m so sorry .
spotted in central park , two white flags waving .
so what will it be truce or consequences ?
sorry , but you &apos;re not on the list .
of course i am . this is my dream !
not anymore .
hey , upper east siders .
there &apos;s nothing gossip girl likes more than a surprise ,
and we hear blair waldorf &apos;s got a 2 @-@ for @-@ 1 special
her mom eleanor , who just returned from paris ,
and serena van der woodsen , brunch buddies .
hey ! you &apos;re up .
did we have plans ?
darling , it is impolite to interrupt .
i was just telling serena
that bendel &apos;s is interested in carrying my line .
really ?
oh , that &apos;s fantastic ! why didn &apos;t you say something ?
i came back from paris early to put together my lookbook ,
and if they like what they see ,
it could be the beginning of an entire lifestyle collection .
because more people should be like you , mother .
before you tuck into that ,
you find a low @-@ fat yogurt more appealing .
i lost 2 pounds when you were away .
and you look marvelous .
wow , these are beautiful , mrs.waldorf.
well , well it be
they will be if they &apos;re not all squished from traveling .
darling , please .
serena , you have to come back later
when everything is unpacked .
i would love to hear your thoughts .
you do have such great personal style .
oh , thank you , but i don &apos;t think we &apos;ll be able to .
blair and i have plans today .
we do ?
serena and blair might have plans for the day ,
but nate and chuck are fully booked for the weekend ...
if they survive it .
found it .
piaget .
can &apos;t you just call it a watch ?
if it costs more than 10 grand ,
it earns a proper name .
how about this ?
definitely that .
babe ruth &apos;s called shot--
the most famous homer he ever hit .
better safe than sorry .
here we go .
you &apos;ve lived through ivy week
and hopefully gained entry to the college of your choice .
now let &apos;s ruin those chances .
let me remind you of the rules
as of this moment , there is no outside world that i do not show you .
you eat what i provide , practice what i preach ,
and till i say so ,
the only girls you talk to are the ones i &apos;ve paid for .
let the lost weekend commence !
one , two , three , twins !
who brought the sasquatch ?
isn &apos;t that carter baizen ?
i haven &apos;t seen him since he was a senior and we were in the eighth grade .
he looks intense .
are you high ?
he looks like matthew mcconaughey between movies .
the guy &apos;s a loser .
look , anyone who trades their trust fund for a fanny pack flies
in the face of all
that is holy to chuck bass .
nate archibald , is that you ?
baizen , my man ! i heard you went rogue !
and lived to tell about it .
seems like someone &apos;s itinerary
didn &apos;t leave room for interlopers .
doesn &apos;t chuck know a party isn &apos;t a party until someone crashes ?
oh , god.i forgot what it was like to be with you .
no , they were looking at both of us .
don &apos;t insult me .
it &apos;s been like this all morning ,
starting with your lovely visit with my mother .
she didn &apos;t even call me to tell me she was coming home .
well , she was busy .
she was rushing to get home and everything
because she wanted to see you .
she didn &apos;t even wake me up .
well , you know how eleanor feels about beauty rest .
she likes you more than me .
she does not.you are her daughter .
she doesn &apos;t like anyone more than you.she just ...
i don &apos;t know , doesn &apos;t know how to show it sometimes .
okay , i &apos;m going inside.wait for me .
i &apos;ll be right back .
humphrey ! dan ! hey !
oh , my god , this is what i love about this city
you &apos;re always bumping into people .
what are you doing here ?
oh , i &apos;m just on my way back from my mom &apos;s ,
dropping jenny offup in hudson .
picked up a couple of cubans for me and my dad ...
sandwiches , not cigars .
hey , uh , remember you said , uh , we could get together sometime
and , um , not talk ?
i was just wondering , is it &quot; sometime &quot; yet ?
that was disgusting.the d.o.h.should shut them down .
the bathroom ?
no , the people .
it &apos;s callednolita , not noshowers .
what are you doing here ?
do i smell pork ? and cheese ?
okay , well , when you &apos;re done with your charity work ,
why don &apos;t you come find me ?
i &apos;ll be at tory burch looking at ponchos .
isn &apos;t that the girl that told the entire school
and , oh , several colleges--that you had a drug problem ?
yeah .
but , you know , blair can be a little ...
blair. yeah , yeah .
we &apos;re actually trying to work things out .
today &apos;s our first day hanging out together alone .
so i should probably get back .
yeah.yeah , sure.that &apos;s ... yeah .
but , um , call me sometime
so we can get together
and do that thing you didn &apos;t ask me to do .
so i don &apos;t understand .
the last time i saw your sister ,
she said your family had locked you out
and you &apos;d fallen off the face of the earth .
i didn &apos;t.i just fell off the face of theirs .
but once you turn away from money
you see it doesn &apos;t buy you freedom ,
it pays for your prison .
they say i disappeared , but all i did was break out .
where &apos;d you go ?
where didn &apos;t i ? i aided the cleanup post @-@ katrina ,
spent a year rebuilding machu picchu
which , let me tell you , it &apos;s changed my life .
i bought an h.d.cam and started filming it for a documentary
you &apos;re the guy who gave us our first joint ,
snuck us into our first club ,
and you &apos;re gonna tell me the life of youtube filmmaker
is better than this ?
you invented the lost weekend .
hey , who cares about a party when you can travel the world ?
exactly.in the real world ,
the only thing that matters is who you are , not what you own .
as muchas i love the speech
about not needing material things
from a guy who has that much product in his hair ,
this party is about excess , not exposition .
stop talking .
start partying .
now here is something that doesn &apos;t need material .
as a matter of fact , it &apos;s about to come off .
who &apos;s with me ?
i think i &apos;m just gonna hang here for a bit .
fine .
i &apos;d hate to break upa matched set anyway .
how about we continue this over some cards ?
none of this crap these kids are playing .
texas hold &apos;em is dead .
you know , i &apos;ll show yousome real action .
you know what ?
i &apos;m in this weekly game in this , uh , corner in queens .
it goes all night .
it &apos;s the real deal--high stakes , big money ,
people with the kind of stories that would put mine to shame .
you should--you should come .
yeah ?
this one missed her cue at the chlo show
because she was throwing up a pear .
ugh.she was invera &apos;s &quot; vogue &quot; spread .
i don &apos;t use vera &apos;s models . none of these are right .
well , that &apos;s because you &apos;re looking atthe high fashion book
when you should belooking for a new face
you know , someone who looks good in your clothes .
someone in this book , like i told you .
i hate the american appareleffect .
but they &apos;re closer to what you need .
they &apos;re--they &apos;re now , they &apos;re hip .
if this person is supposed to represent waldorf designs ,
you have to find mesomeone ...
worthy of the clothes .
someone like me .
someone like ...
my daughter .
well , why not her ?
you want your line to represent the waldorf lifestyle .
who better to represent you than one of your own family ?
she was my first dress form .
she &apos;d love to !
i would ?
eleanor ?
yes .
it &apos;s perfect .
eleanor waldorf ,
meet the new face of waldorf for bendel &apos;s .
is that a smile we see on b . &apos; s lips ?
the spotlight &apos;s on her for once ,
and s.actually helped her get it .
i guess miracles can happen .
it &apos;s gonna be so hot .
the clothes are gorgeous .
they &apos;re all right .
oh , shut up.they &apos;re amazing .
i &apos;m just doing my mom a favor .
the hair and make up testis tonight .
i think this is my best pose .
that &apos;s because you can &apos;t see what you look like .
you &apos;re just a hand model , and that &apos;s it .
the right way is this.girls , no .
this is how you do it .
no , no , no .
gotta curve your spine forward , elongate .
oh , no.you guys are doing it all wrong .
look , you &apos;re missing the key.show us .
look , look , look.you gotta put the hand on the hip and pop .
that &apos;s how you gotta do it .
hello ? who is this
who &apos;d dare interrupt the van der woodsen as she teaches ?
uh @-@ huh , who &apos;s this ?
i said , &quot; who ? &quot; give me my phone !
dan humphrey .
who is it ?
i &apos;m sorry.the number you &apos;vedialed is no longer in service .
stop it ! who is it ? i &apos;m doing you a favor .
look , i can hear you .
can i just please talk to serena ?
apparently , you can , cabbage patch .
come on.let me have it .
hello ? dan ! hey .
i &apos;m so , so sorry about that .
and i &apos;m so , so ready to hang up .
blair was just playing .
you havemy full attention , i promise .
good , cause i was calling to
ask you to not talk with me at a movie tonight .
tonight where ? what time ?
the sunshine , 7 : 00 .
i &apos;d love to .
uh , i &apos;ll see you there .
see you there .
it &apos;s complicated , isn &apos;t it ?
i can &apos;t stop staring at it .
it &apos;s difficult work .
i mean that in the best way .
it &apos;s enigmatic .
it reminds me ofan early bacon or schnabel .
the artist is in hudson .
i &apos;ve represented her for some ... time .
rufus
bex simon .
i &apos;ve heard a lot about your gallery .
i wasn &apos;t expecting a piece like this from a former rock star .
i prefer &quot; one @-@ hit wonder .
what turned you gallerist ?
i &apos;ve always hadartistic pursuits .
we have something in common .
i always pursue artists .
i &apos;ve been in brooklyn all day
looking for work for a client .
i &apos;m a buyer .
i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d find a piece like this ,
and i don &apos;t think it &apos;ll be here long .
i &apos;d to put it on hold .
may i ?
yeah , of course .
what time do you close ? i &apos;ll stay open .
good .
thank you .
what is carter still doing here ?
i invited him .
or he invited himself ? that is his style .
begging us to break free of our prisons
while stuffing his face with free food and draining our booze .
he &apos;s a dead beat and a hypocrite .
and a good ball player , if i remember right .
you sure you just don &apos;t wanna lose to him there , chuck ?
maybe if your d ... bought you a basketball team instead of a hotel ,
you &apos;d have some skill .
look , this is the lost weekend for juniors ,
not senior citizens.go jump into a volcano .
let &apos;s just settle it on the court . let &apos;s settle it right now .
hey , chill out .
no , this is my game.i pick the players .
i get it.i &apos;ll go .
hey.hey , man .
is that card game tonight ?
yeah .
hey , text methe address later .
i will .
you didn &apos;t have to do that , man.nobody wanted him here .
he &apos;s an older brother bringing everyone down .
let &apos;s just play some ball .
okay , blair , relax.chin down .
hold it there and ...
okay , you ready ?
okay , one more .
this time , let &apos;s exhale.jump around , loosen up .

that &apos;s it.come on , big !
let &apos;s think big , big , big .
one , two , three !
okay , take a break.thank you very much .
who chose this girl ?
eleanor.why ?
she &apos;s so prim and stiff ,
like a bookcase.it &apos;s unnatural .
yeah , but she looks stunning in the clothes , don &apos;t you agree ?
mm @-@ hmm , to my eye , like a goddess .
to this eye ? bleh.like a statue .
this is retail.it &apos;s not editorial .
she needs to let go , have fun , loosen up .
how &apos;s the client going to like the dress
if the modeldoesn &apos;t even like herself ?
first of all , you look amazing !
i know.but look , can i give you a little tip ?
how did i know this was coming ?
no , no , look ,
all you need to do is maybe you could , uh , loosen up a little , you know ?
shake it out .
um , maybe you could be goofy ,
like when we were 10 and we would dance around
to &quot; genie in a bottle &quot; in your mom &apos;s clothes .
help me.help me .
um , okay .
act like a tiger , okay ? come on .
rawr ! no , no , you gotta roar.rawr !
rawr ! give me more tiger ! give me more tiger !

i can &apos;t let my mother down .
hey , you almost here ?
hey , i &apos;m really , really , sorry ,
but i &apos;m kind of stuckat this photo shoot with blair .
it &apos;s a long story ,
but i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna be able to make it .
oh , a photo shoot , huh ?
it sounds really superficial , i know .
but it &apos;s important to her and ,
you know , she &apos;s important to me .
but i &apos;ll make it up to you , though , i promise .
no , it &apos;s no big deal , really.don &apos;t worry about it .
you &apos;re the best.i knew you &apos;d understand .
i &apos;ll call you later .
yeah , yeah .
how many ?
none .
you &apos;re still here .
yeah , i told you i &apos;d wait .
mm , a man who keeps his word.i like it .
you get a chance to talk to your client ?
i &apos;m back , aren &apos;t i ?
write me up an invoice .
really ?
that &apos;s great .
well , you &apos;re awfully excited .
this isn &apos;t your first time , is it ?
selling a painting .
few firsts are left for me .
but the artist will be very pleased .
she &apos;s ... been doing other things for a while .
it &apos;s kind of a big deal for her .
well , for my client , too .
this is a very special piece .
you wouldn &apos;t want to ...
i don &apos;t know--celebrate with a drink ?
actually , the previously mentioned
excited artist is my wife .
i thought you said the artistlived in hudson .
long commute .
she lives there.i don &apos;t .
if the trains everstop running ...
phase three--pub crawl .
five boroughs .
50 pubs ... 500 chances to get laid .
and remember , don &apos;t dip your shillelagh ... in the wrong pot of gold .
let &apos;s go.you can think about your boyfriend inside .
i &apos;m not coming .
seriously , carter baizen sucks .
all right , i don &apos;t know what spell he &apos;s put you under ,
but he &apos;s not your friend.he can &apos;t be trusted .
and why is that ?
cause he doesn &apos;t believe what you believe in ?
it &apos;s exactly what he said--
the money , the drugs , the privileges .
they &apos;re just keeping us numb so we don &apos;t know
it &apos;s--it &apos;s better out there in the real world .
the real world ?
everyone out there wants to be us .
we are what you aspire to ,
not run away from .
you really don &apos;t get me , do you ?
that dream of yours , you know , what is it , really ?
cause i hear you talk about
how you don &apos;t want to go to dartmouth
and how you don &apos;t want to follow in your father &apos;s footsteps ,
but what exactly do you want ?
all i know isit &apos;s not this .
well , you better discover what &quot; it &quot; is
before you throw everything away trying to find it .
and where are you going ?
how was the movie ?
uh , missable ... literally .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know about serena , dad .
i @-@ i can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s worth it .
what do you mean ?
well , uh , she &apos;s best friends with this girl--blair waldorf--
who is basically everything i hate about the upper east side
distilled into one 95 @-@ pound , doe @-@ eyed , bon mot tossing ,
label @-@ whoring package of girlie evil .
no one &apos;s that bad .
she is .
i would barely be exaggerating
if i told you medusa wantsher withering glare back .
well , if there &apos;s anything i &apos;ve learned it &apos;s that usually
there &apos;s something beneath the surface with people like that
to make them act the way they do .
like what--
the o.j.in her mimosa was fromconcentrate , not fresh @-@ squeezed ?
and--and what does this say about serena ,
that this is her best friend ?
i dated a girl like serena once
actually , a lot like serena .
and girls like that are challenging.it &apos;s true .
they &apos;re complicated and ...
enigmatic ...
and usually worth it .
and the only way you &apos;ll know for sure is to jump in with both feet .
what happened with you ?
i swam for a while ...
till i drowned .
well , that--thanks.that &apos;s a great story , dad .
now get some sleep ,
and i will see you in the morning .
we &apos;ll goto the photo shoot together .
you haven &apos;t done this since i was little .
you haven &apos;t been in bed by since you were little .
you looked beautiful tonight , you know ?
really ?
hello ?
how was the movie ?
did i miss something amazing ?
well ... uh , even without the movie .
don &apos;t be cocky . i &apos;m calling you with a makeup plan .
oh , are you now ?
i am .
how would you like to see what really happens at a fashion shoot ?
i &apos;m sorry.this is--this is dan humphrey .
are you sure you &apos;re not trying to reach my sister ?
look , i know it &apos;s a girlie offer ,
but chew on this-- i &apos;ll be there.can i bet on that
because law of averages says i lose my shirt .
oh , come on.it &apos;s blair &apos;s shoot , so i have to be there for moral support .
blair ? well , i &apos;m definitely not going now .
look , she &apos;s really not as bad as you think .
besides , she &apos;s gonna be so busy with the shoot
that you won &apos;t even have to see her ,
and since it &apos;s so boring on the sidelines ,
you &apos;ll have my full attention .
okay , what if i buy you anything you want from craft service ?
i thought craft service was free .
i &apos;ll see you in the morningat 8 : 00.i &apos;m texting you the address .
i &apos;m hanging up before thou dost protest again .
both feet , humphrey .
what &apos;s the emergency
apart from my not getting my sleep before the big day ,
laurel , and why couldn &apos;t we simply have discussed it over the phone ?
because if we didn &apos;t meet in person , i couldn &apos;t show you these .
i don &apos;t think this girl is what you &apos;re trying to say--
unapproachable , controlled , perfect .
she is not unapproachable.she is poised.she &apos;s regal .
look , i know she &apos;s your daughter ,
and i don &apos;t want to make problems ...
but your girl is rigid like a twig .
you know , she &apos;s afraid to let you in ,
so your works of art
and she fail to achieve--
what &apos;s the word ?
symbiosis .
what can be done eat this stage ?
your daughter is beautiful , yes , but this girl--
this girl has it .
she is warm like sunshine.she has fun .
she will make the clients thinkif they buy these clothes ,
then they will have fun , too .
but this is your line , eleanor .
it &apos;s completely your choice .
the rules for a model the day of a photo shoot are
similar to those of a patient presurgery--
no food or drink 12 hours prior ,
wear comfortable clothing
and make sure your affairs are in order .
you never know what could go wrong in a flash .
hey , b.you must either be sleeping or already on your way .
but i can &apos;t wait to see you at the shoot .
we &apos;re gonna have so much fun !
oh , thank god you &apos;re awake .
am i late ?
oh , my god.oh , my god.did i oversleep ?
darling , i have some bad news .
terry , that foolof a photographer , thinks we need to go in a different direction .
with the theme ?
with the model .
darling , i hired these people for their expertise ,
and ultimately , they feel that ...
we would be doing the branda disservice .
i @-@ i cannot apologize enough .
i know that you were really looking forward to this .
no , i wasn &apos;t .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m glad i don &apos;t have to go .
i hate shoots .
they &apos;re so boring .
you should have alessandra ambrosio , not an amateur .
we &apos;ll have dinner after , yes ?
steak frites and crepesat caf ? des artistes ,
just like old times .
i will see you later .
hey , s.all right , i hope you &apos;re not already there ,
because as it turns out , my modeling career &apos;s over
faster than jessica simpson &apos;s acting one .
i was think about it
maybe we should crash the shoot anyway
and see who they replace me with ,
make fun of the skinny bitch
how could you
actually , i like this here .
this is no joke , humphrey .
what are you doing with that ?
the question is , what are you doing selling it to me ?
you ... you &apos;re bex &apos;s client .
oh , and you didn &apos;t know .
i &apos;m just surprised you hired someone with taste .
oh , well , i am equally as shocked ,
because when she said she found something amazing in brooklyn ,
your gallery never entered my mind .
you &apos;o have tactually recognize art to remember the place .
what i recognize is the fact
that your wife would not want this hanging in my house .
alison &apos;s a professional artist .
she doesn &apos;t do background checkson prospective buyers ,
and neither do i .
besides , it &apos;s been almost 20 years .
and you still don &apos;t know women .
and you still know it all .
your wife despises me .
i wouldn &apos;t say that .
well , she did .
i mean , she may have been wearing a slip dress
and doc martens at the time ,
but she definitely meant it .
she &apos;s not like you.she doesn &apos;t hold on to that stuff .
why don &apos;t you calland ask her ?
or are you still giving her her space ?
because trust me , putting this up in my house ,
even having this conversation with you ,
will only drive her further away .
well , what do you want me to do then ?
take it back .
you can call bexand set up a refund .
so what &apos;d you think of it ?
i thought ...
it was extraordinary .
hey , no phones .
oh , right.sorry , man .
how much you up ?
five thousand
that &apos;s insane , amigo .
i should probably quit while i &apos;m ahead , huh ?
what ? we just started . well , i &apos;ve had a good run .
plus , it &apos;s better to leave while you &apos;re up .
i &apos;m not--i &apos;m not gonna let you do that , bro .
the table &apos;s about to get smaller .
people are gonna start showing their real stuff .
up until nowit &apos;s been cards ,
but ... from now on , it &apos;s an adventure .
just a couple more hands .
all right , gents , ante up .
okay .
let &apos;s hit it .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
fantastic.one , two , three , come on--oh !
there she is .
blair ! come on , quick.what took you so long ?
blair .
blairblair , wait , where are you going ?
blair , wait.why are you so mad ?
why am i mad ? you mean why aren &apos;t i furious ?
i can &apos;t believe for one second
i thought that it &apos;d be different this time !
you thought what would be different ?
you couldn &apos;t deal with the spotlight shining on me for once , could you ?
what are you talking about ?
i was told we were doing this together .
what , did you not get my message ?
what about this morning then ?
when you glanced at the call sheet ,
did you see my name on it ?
when i wasn &apos;tin hair and makeup ,
didn &apos;t that seem strange ?
when the dressing roomonly had your name on the door ,
what , did you think they just forgot ?
i was told you were running late ,
and they asked me to do some test shots first .
blair , they told me you wanted me here .
and you believed them ?
look , blair , i encouraged you to do this .
why would i try to steal something
from you that i pushed you to do ?
because you take everything from me !
nate , my mom ! blair !
you can &apos;t even help it.it &apos;s who you are .
i just thought maybe this time it would be different .
i should have known i &apos;d be wrong .
great .
spotted-- lonely boy &apos;s rude awakening .
upper east side queens aren &apos;t born at the top .
they climb their way up in heels ,
no matter who they have to tread on to do it .
there you are
eleanor , i quit .
wait a minute.why ?
i think you know why .
because of blair ?
i know that she will support my decision ...
once i explain it to her .
you know you love the spotlight.you always have .
it &apos;s part of your charm.there is nothing wrong with that--
who are you ? what are you doing here ?
i have no idea , actually .
i ...
hey , i k--i kinda overheard you guys in the stairwell there .
dan , look , i really can &apos;t go now .
o @-@ okay , well , forget i said anything then .
in fact , you know what ? i &apos;m mute .
i &apos;ll just stand here and blink real quiet .
unless you want me to
hand me my jeans ? yes , please .
it &apos;s just ,
i thought you wanted to be on the sidelines here .
i thought you wanted to be here for your friend blair .
you know , we were gonna get craft service ,
and i &apos;d have your &quot; full attention &quot; ?
say it .
i @-@ i don &apos;t think i have to .
so my best friend doesn &apos;t believe me ,
and neither does the guy i like .
look , dan , blair &apos;s mom basically tricked me into coming here
because she didn &apos;t want blair .
how do you tell your best friend something like that ?
i @-@ i didn &apos;t--i guess i didn &apos;t--
look , you know what , dan ? just go , okay ?
i @-@ i need to clean up , and i just need to get out of here .
serena send you here to talk to me ?
no , believe it or not , i actually came here myself .
normally , wouldn &apos;t be this close to you without a tetanus shot .
my , uh , my mom kinda left us a couple months ago ...
only my ...
my dad and my sister don &apos;t really see that ...
cause she told us she had to go away for the summer to ,
um , to follow her dream of being an artist .
but it &apos;s--it &apos;s not summer anymore ,
and she &apos;s still up there ,
and that &apos;s all she seems to care about right now .
every time i go to see her , i tell myself , this time ,
i &apos;m gonna tell her what i think .
this time , i &apos;m gonna look her in the eye and say ,
either come homeor leave for good .
and so there i was , just the other day .
i was sitting across the table from her ,
looking her straight in the eye ,
and i didn &apos;t say anything .
why not ?
i don &apos;t know , but i wish i had ,
cause even if it didn &apos;t change anything ,
she &apos;d know how i felt .
bullet , gentlemen .

it &apos;s cool.i @-@ i @-@ i got it.i got it .
i &apos;m gonna haveto transfer some money
and pray the captain doesn &apos;t notice
before i find a way to put it back .
you don &apos;t haveto pay me back , you know .
i mean , it was worth every cent
to see the last of that guy .
no , i want to .
i mean it .
thanks .
that can &apos;t be right.what &apos;s up ?
it says i &apos;m zeroed out .
maybe you have the wrong account .
no , no , no , no.there must be something wrong .
i accessed this account last month ,
and it said there was almost $ 200,000 .
hey , tom , thanks for getting back to me so quickly .
your message said it was important .
um , yeah , i was--i was checking my accounts ,
and i came acrosswhat i assume to be an error ,
in that my trust seems to have a zero balance .
oh , uh , i thought you knew .
that account was drained weeks ago .
drained ?
but by who ?
your father .
he said he discussed it with you .
we--we have to solve this.i mean , what are we gonna do ?
i &apos;m not into gettinga lingerie model .
uh , blair , honey , there &apos;s been a terrible mistake .
how would you like your job back ?
did you choose serena over me ?
you could &apos;ve picked a stranger .
you didn &apos;t have to choose my best friend .
what , did you think that i wouldn &apos;t find out ?
i was going to tell you tonight ...
at dinner .
it--there was no right decision.there ...
there--there wasn &apos;t any time .
i know you can understandall this .
it was mishandled--
the whole thing--from top to bottom .
you actually want me to agree with you .
bendel &apos;s will legitimize this company .
it will take everything to the next level .
you know how hard i have worked for that .
you &apos;ve always been my biggest supporter ,
my biggest fan .
i &apos;m your daughter .
and as my daughter , i knew that you would forgive me , in time ,
but if my company had lost this deal because of you ?
i &apos;d never forgive myself .
i hope you never do .
you didn &apos;t hear it from us ,
but in every girl &apos;s life ,
there comes a moment when she realizes
that her mother just might be more messed up than she is .
you &apos;re still here ?
yeah , well , i thought i couldn &apos;t leave
without bringing you something from craft service .
um , and , uh , and telling you that i &apos;m sorry i judged you .
well , i &apos;m sorry i gave you reason to .
hey , how about you ask me out again ?
how about you actually show up ?
okay . no drama , no disruptions.i promise .
you promise ? oh , no !
that means it &apos;s never gonna happen now .
okay , quick.i take it back.i unpromise .
friday.8 : 00 .
i think we can agree to those terms ,
but you can &apos;t wear those shoes .
or that hair .
okay , see you then .
all right .
so you were right.i know .
when i got that call ,
i should &apos;ve known you had nothing to do with it .
and i should never have pushed you to do this whole thing in the first place .
actually , i &apos;m glad you pushed me
it ended up being a very important day for me .
i just thought it was gonna be more fun .
i know.me , too .
hey , you know what ? who says it can &apos;t be
come on.come on .
this just in-- s.and b.committing a crime of fashion .
who doesn &apos;t love a 5 @-@ finger discount ?
especially if one of those fingers is the middle one .
where are my clothes ?
everyone knows you can &apos;t choose your family ,
but you can choose your friends ,
and in a world ruled by bloodlines and bank accounts ,
it pays to have a pal .
do it again.one , two--one , two , three .
as a b.f.f can make you go w.t.f ,
there &apos;s no denying we &apos;d all be a little less rich without them .
and serena and blair--they do besties better than anyone .
no , that &apos;s not a tear in my eye .
it &apos;s just allergies .
without you , i &apos;m nothing .
gossip girl .
