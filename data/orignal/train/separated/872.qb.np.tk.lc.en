moves the ball .
swoops !
my brother barry -- a world @-@ class athlete ...
doesn &apos;t count . i wasn &apos;t ready .
... in his own mind .
he dedicated his life to hockey , hoops ,
and the art of dance , or whatever this is .
even though barry dreamed of greatness ,
one thing always stood in his way .
no more karate ! end of story !
and that thing was my mom .
no karate ? ! are you nuts ? !
i &apos;m the next chuck norris !
she always had a tragic tale
to warn us about the dangers of everything .
that &apos;s what esther carp &apos;s son said ,
and he got a big toe right in his eye .
now he can &apos;t see color . is that what you want ?
ruth rosner &apos;s grandson was doing the worm .
he cracked every vertebrae in his body .
now he &apos;s two inches shorter . is that what you want ?
how much will you be moving
when a skate glides over your windpipe ?
it happened to judy muntz &apos;s nephew ,
and now he can only communicate
with a speak &amp; spell he wears around his neck .
is that what you want ?
who are these people ?
tragedy befalls all of them , and i have no idea who they are !
my mom &apos;s constant smothering
led barry to take out his aggression elsewhere .
um , it &apos;s been like five minutes .
i can live without the zagnut .
not on my watch .
you wanted nuts all zagged up in hot fudge ,
cookie dough , honey , and peppermint dust ?
none of those things are in that bar .
barry &apos;s gonna get it for you .
who &apos;s barry ?
i &apos;m barry !
how do you not know this by now ? !
wait ! come back ! i can do it !
come on , c4 ! let go , you son of a bitch !
nice moves , goldfarb .
what ?
i &apos;ve been watching you , kid .
i seen you freak out and melt down all over school .
go on .
you got that unhinged look in your eye .
i like it . i like it a lot .
my mother says my eyes are the brownest brown .
i &apos;ve seen browner .
but let me ask you something --
have you ever thought about joining
the varsity wrestling team ?
have i ? ! no .
well , we got an opening in your weight class ...
if you &apos;re man enough to handle the pain .
in that moment ,
barry realized how to win over lexy bloom --
a varsity jacket --
the holy grail with cheap leather sleeves .
i &apos;m in !
bring the pain .
look out , hulk hogan .
barry goldberg &apos;s on the loose .
ohh , i heard something pop !
it was impossible to be a kid in the &apos; 80s
and not love &quot; star wars . &quot;
it was the movie that changed everything .
it gave us lightsabers , the force ,
and billy dee williams in a cape .
so you could imagine how pumped i was
when george lucas decided to close out the trilogy forever .
boom ! it is upon us !
&quot; return of the jedi &quot; ! that &apos;s right , they did it again .
and guess what -- it opens friday at the hiway theater .
oh , my god ! that &apos;s amazing !
go away .
you clearly don &apos;t understand what i &apos;m saying .
more &quot; star wars . &quot;
we get it . &quot; star wars &quot; is your life .
but if you still want to have a life ,
then stop pestering me .
i &apos;m sensing more resistance than i was expecting ,
so i &apos;ll adjust my expectations .
instead , i &apos;ll ask that you pack a sleeping bag ,
some rations , and spend the night with me
on the sidewalk waiting for tickets .
what were your origina expectations ?
don &apos;t answer that because i don &apos;t care ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s not happening .
please !
mom says the only way i can do it is if you come with me .
mom only said that because she knew i &apos;d say no .
obviously , but she doesn &apos;t know what i know --
you love &quot; star wars . &quot;
bow before princess leia !
never !
death grip !
reverse death grip !
i &apos;m dead .
i made copies .
damn it !
here &apos;s how this is gonna go --
you &apos;re either gonna come to the movie with me ,
or this tape magically ends up playing
at your next school assembly .
i hate you .
we &apos;re gonna have so much fun .
ask mom .
i got a permission slip for --
ask mom .
mom will say no .
ask mom .
i need you to sign it .
ask mom .
i &apos;m joining the wrestling team .
what ? really ?
so you &apos;ll let me wrestle ?
of course .
you know , your old man was quite the grappler
back in high school .
i bet that &apos;s the reason you &apos;re doing it .
not at all .
tiny bit ?
no .
maybe a little ?
no .
not even this much ?
i &apos;m doing it for the ladies .
you see , first you join the wrestling team ,
then you get the varsity jacket , then you get the power ,
then you get the women .
everything you just said makes so much sense .
let me teach you some moves .
no need . already learned them .
how ?
a little thing called &quot; wrestlemania . &quot;
this is jimmy &quot; superfly &quot; snuka doing the superfly splash !
piledriver !
atomic elbow drop !
george &quot; the animal &quot; steele is biting the turnbuckle .
stop ! who does that ? !
the claw ! the claw !
he &apos;s applying the sleeper hold !
body slam !
you do understand it &apos;s not that kind of wrestling .
what ?
that stuff &apos;s not real .
what are you saying ?
none of it &apos;s real .
if you &apos;re telling me the iron sheik isn &apos;t fighting
to protect his oil interests in this country ,
then my world will literally cave in .
yeah , my dad knew this was gonna take some time to explain .
meanwhile , i was ready to have the time of my life .
back then , you couldn &apos;t just order your seats online .
you had to wait for days on end .
us &quot; star wars &quot; fans were the first ones to camp out .
we were the trailblazers -- the coolest of the cool ,
and everyone knew it ...
well , except my sister .
i want to walk down this line
and punch everyone in the face .
stop . we &apos;re gonna have fun .
and who knows ? we might make some lifelong friends .
hello !
master yoda i am .
sit next to you in line we will .
much bonding we will do .
how old are you ?
46 on the 8th i &apos;ll be .
oh , my god . you have a wedding ring on ?
come on , erica .
i know you &apos;re some big high @-@ school hotshot now ,
but admit it -- these are still your people .
okay , the old dude with the puppet is not my people .
and the guy riding the dog -- not my people .
that dog is a tauntaun , and you know it !
can &apos;t you just try a little bit ... for me ?
fine . a little .
what &apos;s up , mama ?
you ever tandem on a tauntaun ?
not as dirty as it sounds .
go away !
she &apos;s as chilly as the the wampa &apos;s lair .
right ? right ? am i right ?
as erica was finally loosening up ,
my dad was helping barry lock down that varsity jacket .
you seriously want me to lie to mom ?
yes !
you really think your mother would willingly
let you fight another man with your bare hands ?
but i can &apos;t lie . i &apos;m a terrible liar .
everyone knows that .
you just got to keep it quick and simple .
here , let me think .
what would you be doing after school ?
wait ! i got the perfect cover .
we &apos;ll tell mom i joined the army .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to tell your mother --
you &apos;re going into combat ? !
not combat !
i could be one of those dudes who flies a helicopter
and drops in bags of rice .
so now you &apos;re flying a helicopter .
think i can &apos;t ?
no !
i &apos;m tired of you not believing in me !
i &apos;m a good driver !
flying is just like driving , but in 3 @-@ d .
i don &apos;t even know what that means .
okay , i @-@ i think we got a little off the rails here .
l @-@ let &apos;s just move on .
no ! i &apos;m not moving on until he says he believes in me .
fine .
i believe you can drop rice from an imaginary helicopter .
here &apos;s an idea . how about the school play ?
tell her you got a bit part like , uh , a palm tree
or , uh , a villager who goes like this in the background .
i can do that .
you know what , al ?
th could actually work .
hi , handsome men .
how &apos;s it going ?
i joined the wrestling team .
what ? ! yeah , no . never .
evelyn sanderson &apos;s son joined a wrestling team .
he put one foot --
no . no need to tell us that very tragic tale .
save it for another time . barry was just kidding .
tell her what you &apos;re really doing .
i &apos;m in a play ?
are you kidding me ?
snuggle monster , i &apos;m so happy !
what part in &quot; annie &quot; did you get ?
what &apos;s &quot; annie &quot; ?
the musical .
there &apos;s fliers all around school .
who are you playing ?
i &apos;m this guy !
what is that ? what are you doing ?
what guy is that ?
i &apos;m the guy .
you &apos;re daddy warbucks ?
sure .
you &apos;re daddy warbucks ? !
well , i think he &apos;s still a moron
and it &apos;s a stupid idea
and i am not going to get behind it !
he &apos;s doing the play , and that &apos;s the end of it .
you convinced me . i now stand behind my son .
this is so exciting !
ohh , i &apos;ve always wanted to be a stage mom !
i &apos;m gonna build sets and rig lights and sew costumes ,
and i &apos;ll even be an understudy if need be .
no .
if you dare peek into one rehearsal ,
i will quit the play .
you wouldn &apos;t .
i would .
what is wrong with my children ?
why won &apos;t they let me
completely immerse myself in their lives ?
it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m okay .
well , i might not be able to attend an official rehearsal ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean your mom can &apos;t show you a few moves .
i &apos;m gonna go throw on my leg warmers and leotard .
what just happened ?
what just happened is you have to learn &quot; annie . &quot;
good job , moron .
we were only three hours into our &quot; star wars &quot; camp @-@ out ,
but the long wait didn &apos;t matter .
i finally had my sister back .
so , i have a theory .
&quot; star wars &quot; takes place a long time ago
in a galaxy far , far away , right ?
of course .
so , what if han solo is frozen in carbonite
for like a million years
and shipped to a planet far , far away
and that planet was earth in 1940
and he &apos;s thawed out just in time
to change his name to indiana jones ?
i have so much more to say on this topic ,
but i drank all the soda .
dude , that &apos;s our rations !
save my spot .
yep , erica was letting her geek flag fly
and didn &apos;t care who saw it , until her friends arrived .
erica ?
lainey , hey ! hi , hello .
what are you doing here ?
we &apos;re going to get cheesesteaks .
what are you ... doing here ?
what &apos;s up , legs ?
that &apos;s ... what i &apos;m doing here , too .
isn &apos;t this the cheesesteak line ?
eddie &apos;s been asking about you . come with us .
yeah . okay .
you go ahead , and i &apos;ll catch up with you in a second .
okay .
um , my brother will be back in one minute .
will you hold this spot for me ?
is that a yes ?
what is that ?
just save our damn place !
all right . if you come to your feet , go for the takedown .
don &apos;t let him get away with that ! more explosion there !
whoa , what are you doing ? what are you doing ?
what ?
what are you doing with the folding chair ?
you said to practice our takedowns .
the chair @-@ bash is my character &apos;s patented move .
your character ?
yeah . for the wwf .
they call me goldberg .
my backstory is my parents gave me up for adoption ,
and then i grew up on the rough streets of philly .
i &apos;m sensitive , so ladies love me ,
but i also have a raging side , so men can relate , too .
but this isn &apos;t the wwf .
and as someone whose parents really did
give him up for adoption , i can promise you
it &apos;s a lot more emotionally complicated than that .
now , put the chair back .
while barry was having a tough time
accepting this wasn &apos;t the wwf ,
he was having an even tougher time learning &quot; annie . &quot;
together at last
together forever
we &apos;re tying a knot
what &apos;s that , murray ?
they never can sever
i don &apos;t need sunshine now
to turn my gray skies blue
sing it from the diaphragm .
i don &apos;t need anything but you
i &apos;m kind wondering if this whole thing is worth it .
it is what it is .
pops and my dad had helped barry
pull off the perfect cover story .
unfortunately , erica wasn &apos;t interested in covering for me .
hey , that &apos;s my spot . my sister was saving it for me .
where did she go ?
like i care what your sister would do .
she went to get a cheesesteak with her smoking @-@ hot friend .
come on .
i just went to the bathroom for like 10 seconds .
sorry , man . but you should have planned ahead .
the smart ones of us brought along someone
we could trust to hold our spot in line .
others in more unwieldy costumes
have rigged themselves with elaborate tubing
and disposable plastic bags
so that they might quietly relieve themselves
even while talking to a stranger .
what ?
can &apos;t a man &quot; ahh &quot; in relief without being judged ?
unreal . unreal , you guys .
seriously ?
you &apos;re not gonna let me back into my spot ?
i &apos;m just a boy .
seriously ?
luke skywalker was just a boy , okay ?
rules are the rules .
good luck catching the sunday matinee .
my sister had done the unthinkable .
she ruined &quot; star wars . &quot;
you &apos;re on the mat sizing up your opponent .
the ref blows the whistle .
he makes his move . what do you do ?
i bounce off the ropes to get momentum ,
and i spear him with my body .
again ! it &apos;s not that kind of wres--
i know , it &apos;s not that type of wrestling .
i get it .
but those are the only moves i perfected
on my bed jumping around .
it &apos;s true . i &apos;ve seen him . he &apos;s quite a jumper , this one .
okay , let me show you a real move .
this was my specialty back in the day .
you use your opponent &apos;s weight and strength against him .
you smell like sandwich .
shut up .
as i lean in to you , you pull back
and use your opponent &apos;s momentum to take him down !
oh , my god . i &apos;m so bored right now .
just let me hit you with something !
pops , get me a 2x4 .
what are you doing ? ! no 2x4s ! i told you !
barry norman goldberg , look at me .
are you on the wrestling team ?
no ?
oh , really ?
because i was just down at the school theater
building an orphanage for a show
that apparently you &apos;re not even in .
what ? you promised you weren &apos;t going down there .
i have a problem .
yes , he &apos;s on the wrestling team , but that &apos;s a good thing .
i was on the wrestling team , and look how fine i turned out .
how dare you go behind my back
and encourage my delicious baby muffin to lie to me !
bev , come on . it &apos;s not that big of a deal .
let the boy wrestle .
helen cutler &apos;s son was in a wrestling match once
and his head popped right off
and now he lives his life as just a head .
there &apos;s no such thing as just a head !
you need organs to live .
well , tell that to helen cutler
as she &apos;s carrying her son around the grocery store
like a football .
well , where &apos;s his heart ? ! you need a heart to function !
it &apos;s in his neck .
he &apos;s got a little neck with organs in it .
oh , so now he &apos;s got a neck !
what else has he got ?
maybe a body ? !
everyone , shut up !
all my life , you &apos;ve been treating me like a baby .
well , guess what -- it stops now .
i &apos;m a grown adult man and i &apos;m gonna wrestle
and there &apos;s nothing you can do about it !
nothing !
despite my brother &apos;s goofy run , he &apos;d made up his mind .
it was go time ,
but barry wasn &apos;t the only one ready for a fight .
there you are ! you scared me to death !
where were you ?
where were you ? !
i asked you to do one thing -- stand !
just stand there !
but you couldn &apos;t even do that !
and now i &apos;ll never see &quot; return of the jedi . &quot;
oh , please , just to spite me ?
correct ! you ruined &quot; star wars &quot; for me .
from this point on , i &apos;ll have nothing to do with it .
nothing !
dang it ! that &apos;s a collector &apos;s item !
but i don &apos;t care !
why did i do this ?
you made me lose control of my body .
you honestly want to know why i left ?
i didn &apos;t want my friends to see me stand in line
at some space movie that i got blackmailed into
by my dumb kid brother .
i blackmailed you because it &apos;s the only way
to get you to spend time with me .
and i didn &apos;t used to just be your dumb kid brother .
i used to be your friend .
it had been a full day
since i banished &quot; star wars &quot; from my life .
i was in a sarlacc pit of despair ,
that is , until a certain princess rescued me .
get up . put this on .
we &apos;re going to that movie .
i told you i &apos;m not seeing the sunday matinee .
it &apos;s like wearing somebody else &apos;s wedding dress .
what does that even mean ?
it doesn &apos;t matter . we &apos;re going today .
how ?
well , i told the theater manager what happened ,
and he was incredibly sympathetic .
he &apos;s gonna sneak us in .
really ?
i also said i would go to dinner with him and his grandparents .
i really wish i would have just stayed in line .
meanwhile , my brother was ready to fight .
and according to barry logic , if he won this match ,
lexy would never forget his name .
and even though he had a lot to lose ,
it was my dad who had the butterflies .
how you doing , champ ? you nervous ?
i &apos;m not nervous . don &apos;t be nervous .
uh , i &apos;m a little nervous , not about the wrestling thing .
i &apos;m just worried about my catchphrase
&apos;cause once i say it , i can never take it back .
i was thinking , &quot; welcome to the mat . &quot;
no catchphrase .
goldberg , quit trading recipes .
let &apos;s go ! you &apos;re up ! let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go !
look alive ! come on !
this was it --
the start of my brother &apos;s wrestling career ,
and nothing was gonna stop him .
i said no !
mom ?
are you kidding me right now ? move .
i will not move . i will never move .
you &apos;re my special boy .
if you end up being just a head ,
then i have failed as a mother .
no .
no .
barry ! what did i say ?
what did i say ? what did --
mom , lexy bloom is watching me right now .
what the hell are you doing ? !
i &apos;m saving your life .
bevy , no !
i love you , honey !
i love you so much ! i will never let you go !
don &apos;t fight back ! go limp under mama !
and we &apos;re off the rails again .
dad , help me ! she &apos;s so strong !
i &apos;m trying !
tap out , barry .
barry , tap out !
i &apos;m tapping out !
tap out , barry !
you are a nightmare , okay ? !
now lexy bloom will never follow me to college
on a wrestling scholarship .
you have no right to be mad at me -- no right !
you &apos;re the one who lied and directly defied my orders .
true story .
oh , here we go !
susie goodman &apos;s son defied her at one point .
i don &apos;t care !
how do you know so many sad people ? !
and do you know that that resulted in his tragic --
enough !
all right , bevy ,
no one loves a tragic parenting tale more than you .
did you ever hear the one about beverly goldberg &apos;s son ?
he got utterly dominated by her
in front of the whole school and was made a laughingstock .
oh , my god .
that is kind of what happened , isn &apos;t it ?
honey , at a certain point ,
you &apos;re only hurting them by holding them back .
well , the damage is done .
not yet .
what ?
there is a way to make people forget
the terrible things they saw today ,
and that &apos;s for you to go out and pulverize this kid
and show him why your catchphrase
is &quot; welcome to the mat ! ... &quot;
or something better that you think of
on your way out there .
and , bevy , i will hold your hand through the whole thing .
go get &apos; em , poopie .
that day my brother and i each opened a door
that would change our lives forever .
i &apos;ll always remember
stepping into my little hometown theater ,
heart pounding ,
knowing that i was about to watch pure magic ,
and it was all thanks to my sister .
that &apos;s funny .
i was expecting to wrestle your mom .
welcome to the mat !
all right , goldberg !
i taught him that move !
he learned that from me !
more or less .
oh , my god ! oh , my god !
i &apos;ve always wanted to be a wrestling mom !
i can &apos;t hear you ? !
goldberg can &apos;t hear you !
you know it , girl !
i &apos;m tough , but gentle ,
and we &apos;re gonna ride a horse into the sun .
yeah ! yeah !
okay , so my brother didn &apos;t go on
to become a famous professional wrestler named goldberg .
finishing move !
but in that moment , he felt invincible .
oh , no , no , no ! no ! no !
goldberg , it &apos;s over . it &apos;s over .
it &apos;s over . you won . you won .
yeah !
there &apos;s nothing you remember more
than your childhood victories .
they stay with you forever .
and if you &apos;re lucky ,
your family is right there with you .
thank you so much .
ask mom .
i &apos;ve got some new wrestling moves .
ask mom .
you &apos;re gonna love them .
the hulkster can &apos;t hear you !
the hulkster can &apos;t hear you !
the hulkster can &apos;t hear you !
oh , and he &apos;s raking his face against the ropes !
oh , that can &apos;t be legal !
that just can &apos;t be legal !
oh , no ! he has a foreign object .
how &apos;s the referee not seeing this ?
he &apos;s done ! he &apos;s done !
world champion !
still a moron .
it &apos;s the backbreaker slam !
body slam !
figure @-@ four !
