don &apos;t feel too bad . he knows everyone &apos;s name .
i mean , except mine .
kelsey told principal sanchez about everything .
you are suspended .
if you keep making decisions the way you &apos;ve been making decisions ,
you &apos;re gonna ruin every good thing that comes you way .
you &apos;ve got a family that wants you .
i know where i need to be now .
jesus kicked me out of my room .
he called it his room .
um , hi . this is brandon foster .
i can &apos;t take piano lessons from you anymore .
my family just can &apos;t afford it .
i love you , brandon .
i never realized until today
that for us to be together you have to give up everything .
dad ?
what was your mom &apos;s funeral like ?
everyone just kept telling us
she &apos;s in a better place now .
some article in the newspaper today ?
make me some overzealous cop with a vendetta .
i thought this was supposed to go away .
isn &apos;t there something that you need to say to your wife ?
something about a baby ?
you wanna have a baby ?
so , callie , you &apos;re going home . how you feel ?
good . excited .
yeah . scared ?
no .
a little .
be sure to tell jesus i say hi .
oh , really , gabi , why don &apos;t we talk about
what scares us all about going home .
anybody ?
temptations .
yeah .
like brandon . how &apos;s that gonna work ?
yeah , how is that gonna work , callie ?
have you had any time to think that through ?
i mean , he &apos;s gonna be my brother .
once jude and i are adopted . so ...
you &apos;re gonna be sleeping under the same roof ,
he &apos;s right next door .
you &apos;re not gonna be like laying awake
thinking you could just sneak into his bedroom ?
ok , gabi , enough .
come on .
are you like , really over him ?
i know what i want .
i mean , it &apos;s great that you &apos;re leaving here
knowing what you want , it really is a good start .
but it &apos;s easy to get confused .
you &apos;re not going to have group twice a day .
you &apos;re not going to be confronted
by any of these lovely young ladies ,
trying to get you to talk about how you feel .
you gotta hold yourself accountable .
mm , that &apos;s right .
least you got people .
you &apos;re lucky .
yeah .
the mistake most girls make when they go home
is they underestimate just how tough
it &apos;s going to be out there in the real world .
so don &apos;t be cocky .
and that goes for you too , daph . right ?
why don &apos;t we go around now and
everybody can tell callie what they learned from her .
ok , well ,
callie , i learned from you to shut up and listen .
gab ?
and to not to interrupt .
ok , well , you know , it &apos;s still a work in progress .
yeah .
i learned we &apos;ve all got addictions .
and , i could trust you .
carmen ?
i , um , learned to not judge just on , you know , looks .
she looked like she didn &apos;t belong here ...
... but she did .
i didn &apos;t really learn anything from you .
except i learned how to look like all blank and superior .
that &apos;s harsh .
come on .
no , that &apos;s like a really good skill
to have in certain situations .
mm . yeah , that was a nice save .
really , good . cole . you &apos;re up .
i learned ...
... that you &apos;re my friend .
and i learned about forgiveness .
callie , why don &apos;t you share with the girls
what you learned from them .
um , yeah .
well , you all , um ...
... taught me what courage is .
every one of you ,
you &apos;re so brave and awesome .
even you becka .
and rita . um ...
you taught me that compassion
is given for free ...
... but ...
... respect has to be earned .
i really respect you .
thank you , callie .
i really respect you , too .
and we &apos;re gonna miss you , right ?
yeah .
yeah , you better come back and visit .
yeah .
come on , group hug , let &apos;s go .
everybody , becka , cole .
the last one for callie , make it good .
remember you &apos;ve got people who love you !
welcome home ! i missed you .
i missed you too , big time .
welcome back .
i have to , uh , finish my book report .
it &apos;s due tomorrow .
sweetheart , can &apos;t you finish that after dinner ?
oh , it &apos;s ok . we &apos;ll catch up later , right ?
i heard jesus wanted to be here , but he had practice .
it &apos;s cool .
so let &apos;s go set the table .
ok , i &apos;ll take this away for you .
thank you .
alright .
i &apos;m really glad you &apos;re back .
thanks , me too .
what &apos;s up ?
look , um ...
this is just something i needed to do , for me .
ok , it &apos;s not your fault or anything .
what &apos;s not my fault ?
i asked my moms ...
our ... moms ,
uh ... not to tell you ,
because i didn &apos;t want to affect your decision .
brandon , what ?
i just need some time to figure things out .
so i moved in with my dad .
thanks you for cleaning up , sweetheart .
why don &apos;t you come sit down with us , callie .
i just want to say i &apos;m really ...
... really sorry about brandon moving out .
i feel terrible .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s only temporary .
but he &apos;s gonna be around here a lot
so you guys are gonna have to ...
stick to the ground rules , i know .
so listen , things are going to be a little different around here .
we &apos;re going to need to know where you are at all times , all right ?
you have wireless and you can text but no internet .
and we &apos;re going to need you to leave
the find my phone app on so we can ...
track me down if you need to find me .
we know that this is a little bit ...
no , i get it .
i have to earn back your trust .
everyone &apos;s trust .
演唱者 hannah cohen
... and you need a comma right here .
ok .
i think you could cut this sentence shorter
and just get to the theme quicker .
right .
hey . mariana &apos;s been helping me with my paper .
that &apos;s great .
see you in the morning .
well , you will .
he &apos;s just ...
i know . it &apos;s ok .

yeah , he swears that it &apos;s not working .
well , that is part of the deal . he &apos;s not been meditating either .
jude , your book report &apos;s perfect .
thanks .
my stomach &apos;s in knots ,
i &apos;ve been suspended for a week but it feels like forever .
are you afraid that they &apos;re talking about you ?
no , i mean ... maybe .
do you think they were ?
what are people saying about callie ?
it doesn &apos;t matter , honey ?
i think all they heard was that you ran away with wyatt
and , you know , not anything else .
i don &apos;t really care what other people think .
good for you .
yeah , me either . let the whole school talk about us .
we can be like notorious together .
see , i &apos;ve been notorious .
ain &apos;t all it &apos;s cracked up to be .
ok , where is , uh ...
jesus , come on , dude !
where are you ? let &apos;s go , shake a leg !
hi . can i help you ?
stefanie foster ?
yeah .
you &apos;ve been served .
what &apos;s that ?
uh , it &apos;s a summons .
i &apos;ve been called by the d.a.
to testify in mike &apos;s case .
why ? you were unconscious .
i wasn &apos;t unconscious .
ana &apos;s boyfriend shot me and then dropped the gun .
mike came into the room firing ,
and did not see that the shooter was unarmed .
i was afraid he might &apos;ve said something
and then i would contradict him .
i just ... i don &apos;t ...
it was a judgment call and ...
it was a terrible judgment call .
thank you . thank you .
you were heavily sedated when they talked to you , right ?
you weren &apos;t thinking clearly .
i wish that were the case .
mike did the right thing .
i should have trusted the system , that &apos;s all .
you were just trying to protect mike .
well , it doesn &apos;t matter , i lied .
and now , they &apos;re gonna question me under oath .
so what happens if you come clean ?
i get fired .
whoa ! uh , jeez .
sorry . i &apos;m dani . i &apos;m a , friend , of your dad &apos;s .
oh , uh , it &apos;s cool . i just didn &apos;t ...
yeah , i meant to get up and out .
so it wouldn &apos;t be awkward .
too late .
yeah , exactly .
yeah .
nice jacket .
except for your collar is crooked .
men just aren &apos;t good at dressing themselves .
i overslept !
it &apos;s ok . hey , uh , i see you met hurricane dani .

i &apos;m gonna be late and pilates is my religion .
gotta keep everything high and tight .

you have a girlfriend ?
she &apos;s more like a sober buddy .
well , do you sleep with all your sober buddies ?
excuse me ?
i &apos;m sorry , i thought that you weren &apos;t supposed to be getting into
any kind of relationships when you &apos;re getting sober ?
it &apos;s not a relationship .
i &apos;m not drinking . that &apos;s the most important thing . ok ?
now get going . you &apos;re not gonna be late on my watch .
oh , uh , for lessons this week .
um ... i was actually thinking maybe i could , you know ,
take a break from piano .
what do you mean ? you love piano .
you worked your ass off to get this teacher to take you .
yeah , i know , i &apos;m just a little burned out .
should i be worried ?
no .
is this about callie ?
no , dad , i &apos;m ok . i ...
thank you for paying for the lessons but ...
... it &apos;s not forever . ok ?
ok .
all right . yep . see you .
all right , i &apos;ll see you later .
ignore them .
i have no intentions of acknowledging her miserable existence ,
or her questionable taste in leggings .
i just , what if she &apos;s telling chase terrible things about me ?
you know that feeling in the pit of your stomach ?
that is what it feels like to be notorious .
hey , welcome back .
aw , you noticed i was gone ?
so , cast party tonight . we still on ?
oh , uh , i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m mean , kelsey &apos;s gonna be there

yeah . sure . that sounds good .
sweet ! i &apos;ll see you at lunch ?
how are you ?

教授 亨利 · 马歇尔
hey , uh , professor marshall , this is mike foster ,
brandon &apos;s dad .
uh , yes , today , he told me that
he wanted to take a break from his lessons .
and i &apos;m not sure i should let him .
um , i &apos;d like to discuss that with you ,
if you can call me back that would be great .
uh , thanks .
sorry man .
what the hell , man ?
faulty boomerang . maybe i &apos;m not throwing it right .
mind throwing it somewhere else ?
want a hit ?
no , thanks .
how does that work ?
ditching class when your mom &apos;s the vice principal ?
don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re not gonna narc on me , are ya ?
no .
that callie girl , she &apos;s your foster sister , right ?
did she really run away with the mop head ?
you know , wyatt .
yeah , i know . she didn &apos;t run away with him .
hey , i don &apos;t know why everyone keeps saying that .
look , i &apos;m buying the booze for a party tonight .
you should come check it out .
sounds like you need to blow off some steam .
you &apos;re buying the booze ?
出生日期 1991年3月14日
twenty @-@ three ?
i look young for my age . good genes .
where &apos;d you get this ?
a buddy of mine uses his school id maker .
and it really works ? you don &apos;t get busted or anything ?
i use it at liquor stores , bars , never had a problem .
if you want one , i could hook you up ?
出生日期 1991年3月14日
i had to say it . it was so cool .
is one of you , jude ?
uh , he is .
then these are for you .
thank you .
enjoy !
what was that ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , actually , tomorrow is kinda my birthday .
how does the cupcake delivery girl know before me ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s her actual job .
my mom gave birth to me at home
and when she went to file the paperwork ,
they messed up the date by a couple weeks .
so when callie and i went into the foster system ,
we never told anyone my real birth date .
we kept it a secret , you know , just for us .
so can we eat them ?
hold on .
she must be trying to send me some type of message or something .
what does it mean ?
i have no idea .
here .
now , can we eat &apos; em ?
so , how &apos;s it going at your dad &apos;s ?
ok . um , he has a girlfriend .
wait , really ?
it &apos;s kinda weird .
well , i mean , he &apos;s not working and he &apos;s under investigation ,
i guess he kind of deserves a girlfriend .
what &apos;s going on with the d.a. and all that , anyway ?
i mean , is everything ok ?
yeah , seems like it .
you know , he says they have nothing ,
except for ana &apos;s testimony .
so it should blow over .
you know , if it wasn &apos;t for me ,
mom would &apos;ve never gotten shot
and your dad wouldn &apos;t be going through all this .
i just ...
i wish there was something i could do .
maybe if i talked to her ...
no , don &apos;t even think about it . no way . stay away from her .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
she &apos;d probably just ask me for more money .
hey . what are you doing home ?
um , i &apos;m ... i needed something from my room .
ok .
what about you ?
i , um ...
i &apos;m being questioned by the d.a. this afternoon .
and the lawyer told me to come as a person ,
not as a cop , no uniform .
this is going away , right ?
i mean , dad said they have no case .
yeah . yeah , it &apos;s just politics , you know ?
nothing to worry about .
ok .
ok .
good to see you .
did you find any more clues at school ?
i don &apos;t think so . i looked all over .
here &apos;s one .
it says &quot; anxiety . &quot;
that &apos;s what i &apos;m getting looking for these clues .
i don &apos;t see any more ducks .
look for candy !
ok .
oh , i got one .
up here !
i don &apos;t see any more .
oh , here &apos;s one .
hmm . &quot; and ... all ... anxiety ...
... they ... was ... perfect &quot; ?
how about ...
&quot; perfect ... anxiety ...
... they all ...
... and was . &quot;
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s it .
hey , chase .
um , i just wanted to apologize
for the whole stolen fedora thing .
i don &apos;t want you to think i &apos;m that kind of person .
kelsey actually took it , but
i should have made her take it back to the store .
but you loved it so much and now i &apos;m babbling so ...
it &apos;s fine . no harm done .
i just miss you working on the play .
i missed that smile , too .
you gonna come to the cast party tonight ?
yeah , totally . i wouldn &apos;t miss it .
sweet , see you there .
do you solemnly state that the testimony you will give
in this deposition proceeding is the truth , the whole truth ,
and nothing but the truth ?
i do .
please state your name ,
rank and position in the police department .
my name is stefanie foster . i am a corporal with ...
at this point , you were in the second bedroom
by yourself , is that correct ?
yes .
where was your partner at the time ?
he was clearing the kitchen .
and it was at this moment you were shot ,
fell to the ground , unconscious , correct ?
no .
i &apos;m sorry ?
no , i was not unconscious .
i have here your statement to internal affairs ,
and you clearly state ...
i lied .
i was awake . i saw the whole thing .
after firing on me , the shooter dropped his gun and it misfired .
he did not have his hands up
and surrender when officer foster entered
and fired on him ,
as we were trained to do .
i see . and how do i know you &apos;re not lying now ?
because i &apos;m under oath .
and because by telling you this , i could very well lose my job .
i was surprised to hear from you .
thanks for meeting me on such sort notice .
is this about jesus and mariana ? are they ok ?
they are .
i mean , they &apos;re pretty upset about our mom getting shot .
of course , i &apos;m sure .
can you just tell them that i &apos;m sorry ?
if you &apos;re sorry then why are you lying ?
lying ? about ...
being at the house when my dad shot your boyfriend .
i was .
with jesus . at the women &apos;s shelter .
you wouldn &apos;t have gone to meet him ,
knowing that our mom could be dying .
just to get money from him .
you wouldn &apos;t do that .
right ? because i mean ...
... they would hate you .
i mean , right ?
right . i wouldn &apos;t do that .
because , you care about them .
i do . i love them .
and you want to maybe
someday be a part of their lives .
so you gotta tell the d.a. the truth .
that you weren &apos;t there .
because if you were there ...
... they would never forgive you .
i want to tell the truth .
it &apos;s just ...
they really want me to testify
and i don &apos;t ... i &apos;m scared
that they &apos;re gonna cut off my food stamps ...
maybe i can help you .
that &apos;s a lot of money .
i just want you to feel safe ,
you know , to do what &apos;s right .
the last time you went to a party ,
mariana , you got drunk .
and i also got grounded and learned my lesson .
besides , it &apos;s the cast party ,
there &apos;s not gonna be any alcohol there .
ok , what if callie goes with me ?
she didn &apos;t drink last time .
she can be like my chaperone or something .
yeah , um , i don &apos;t think i want that responsibility .
you know , i &apos;m on probation , remember ?
yeah , i agree .
it &apos;s not callie &apos;s job to babysit you , honey .
ok , well , you can like drive us off and pick us up .
we can even take a breathalyzer test if you want .
mariana ...
how are you gonna know if you can ever trust us
if you don &apos;t give us the chance to prove ourselves ?
i mean , you want callie to make friends and get involved .
how is she going to do that if she &apos;s locked up at home ?
all right , i will discuss it with your mom when she gets home .
i found 11 clues . are there more ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
at least tell me if there are 13 .
maybe . have you figured out what it says yet ?
no . what does it say ?
what does what say ?
the puzzle .
what puzzle ? - you just admitted -
i admit nothing .
well , if you ... if you lose your job , we &apos;ll figure it out .
it &apos;s just ...
i won &apos;t have a baby .
i don &apos;t want to be the reason that you don &apos;t have a baby .
it &apos;s ... life is the reason , ok ?
sometimes things are just not meant to be .
hey . did you talk about the cast party ? can i go ?
what &apos;s wrong ? am i in trouble ?
no , love .
hey . what &apos;re you grinning about ?
ana recanted .
said she &apos;s wasn &apos;t even there
at the time of the shooting . d.a. &apos; s dropping the investigation .
oh , my god .
you &apos;re kidding me ?
wow . congratulations , mike . i &apos;m so happy .
me too .
there &apos;s something you don &apos;t see every day .
right ?
hey , bud .
i got your text , what &apos;s up ?
ana changed her story , it &apos;s all over .
that &apos;s great news .
so , how does this affect your deposition ?
well , it &apos;s dead , right ?
yeah , it &apos;s dead .
i &apos;m gonna open a bottle of champagne .
apple juice for me .
you got it .
wow , so ...
roberts called .
you &apos;re kidding .
yeah , said the d.a. &apos; s office called her and ...
hello ?
yes .
my dad called you ?
no , i understand .
if you could just let me tell him first ...
please .
no , i will . i promise .
thank you .
and i &apos;m sorry to put you in this position .
put who in what position ?
no one .
you just had a conversation with no one ?
that was my piano teacher .
i stopped going a few weeks ago but i didn &apos;t tell my dad .
and i kept the money .
why would you do that ?
i was gonna give it to callie
when she was getting her own apartment .
oh , brandon .
i know .
it was dumb .
i &apos;m going to tell my dad and i &apos;ll give the money back .
ok , good . at least you didn &apos;t spend it .
just let me know how it goes , ok ?
i thought it was supposed to be a small party .
there were only four people in the cast ,
that &apos;s not much of a party .
dude , help me get the rest .
ok , i &apos;m not gonna do anything stupid .
oh , there &apos;s chase . i &apos;m gonna go say hi . be right back .
so you think there &apos;s anything to drink other than beer ?
there was a refreshments budget
but clearly i wasn &apos;t on that committee .
hey , um , i &apos;m sorry if i crashed your ... thing with mariana .
it &apos;s the only way our moms would let her come .
yeah , yeah , no , i mean , the more the merrier .
you were so brilliant in the play .
did you always know you wanted to act ?
i always knew i wanted to change lives .
you do . every night .
hey , i got you a beer and one for myself .
i would have gotten you one ,
but i remember the last time you drank at a party .
two words : projectile vomit .
not true .
it &apos;s ok , there &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of ,
some girls are just lightweights .
you know , i &apos;m gonna go say hi to my leading lady .
back off .
or what ? i can &apos;t believe i ever thought that you were my friend .
you know , you &apos;re just embarrassing yourself in front of chase .
he sees you as a sophomore fan girl and that &apos;s it .
oh yeah ? then why did you feel
so threatened you had to get me kicked off the play ?
do i need to hose you two down with water ?
hashtag cat fight .
cat fight ? that was incredibly sexist .
is one of those for me ?
well , one of them was , but i don &apos;t want to be accused
of being sexist for not letting you get your own .
hey bro . you made it .
what &apos;re you doing here ?
i &apos;m with mariana .
what &apos;s she doing here ?
this is the cast party .
this is the cast party ?
nothing gets past you , man . here , have a beer .
um , i should probably go check on her .
you got a thing for her .
so listen . when can i get that fake ids ?
how soon do you need it ?
i &apos;m looking to make some quick cash so ,
i don &apos;t know , i thought maybe i could
buy some beer for parties like you do .
don &apos;t bogart my business , man .
look , if you want to make some fast bank ,
why don &apos;t we sell some i.d.s ?
isn &apos;t that , like , a felony ?
only if we get caught .
dude , your mom &apos;s the school veep .
you have access to her keys ,
we have access to the id maker at anchor beach .
there &apos;s no end to the demand .
we can make a major business out of this .
i only need like a thousand bucks .
well , if you want to think small ...
i &apos;m so glad you came !
you need to make a bold move .
like what ?
well , this one time , i went to a party and there was this guy
i liked and i wasn &apos;t sure if he was into me .
so , i went in the bathroom and
took off my panties and slid them in his front pocket .
that &apos;s a thing ?
it worked for me .
who was the guy ? wait , don &apos;t tell me it was my brother .
i &apos;m gonna get another beer . you want one ?
no , thanks .
i was just talking about you . your sister &apos;s in here .
i know . she &apos;s with callie .
oh . so that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
i didn &apos;t know she was gonna be here .
what a coincidence .
callie shows up and you
follow her around like a sad , little puppy .
i think you &apos;ve had enough to drink .
i should probably just walk away right now but i told you .
i told you she wasn &apos;t into you
and you were just going to get hurt .
you know what ? i &apos;m so sick
of you and everyone else telling me about my business .
ok , callie is into me .
we kissed at the wedding
and that &apos;s why she ran away with wyatt .
because she didn &apos;t want to mess up jude &apos;s adoption .
and the only reason we &apos;re not together right now
is because she needs a family more than a boyfriend .
so don &apos;t talk about things you don &apos;t understand , ok ?
if you &apos;re interested , i &apos;ll be waiting upstairs .
hello , captain , come on in .
thanks .
thank you for letting me swing by .
absolutely .
i didn &apos;t want to have this discussion at the station .
the d.a. e @-@ mailed me your deposition .
i see .
strangest thing , i ...
i can &apos;t get the damn thing to open on my computer .
but with ana recanting and the charges being dropped ,
i can &apos;t think of a reason to read it .
thank you .
one thing , though , foster ,
i.a. took a lot of heat during all this .
they &apos;re gonna keep their eyes on both you and mike .
so i wouldn &apos;t give out so much
as a parking ticket without following procedure .
you got it .
i &apos;m serious ,
not a whiff of impropriety , or heads are going to roll .
am i clear ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
all right , i &apos;ll see you on monday .
yes you will .
have a good night .
you too . thank you .
what are you doing up here ?
oh , um , nothing .
i was just looking for someplace quiet to hang .
oh , cool . oh , do you mind if i join you ?
so i ...
i just want you to know , that ,
like in case you were wondering ...
well , the thing is , i ...
oh . sorry , am i interrupting something ?
kind of .
no . not really . we can finish this later . right , zac ?
yeah . yeah , sure .
it wasn &apos;t important . it &apos;s just , callie &apos;s looking for you .
i believe ...
... these belong to you ?
you &apos;re pathetic and disgusting .
i knew it the first time i saw you ,
and i let everyone convince me i was wrong .
but i wasn &apos;t wrong . i was right .
hey girls , watch your backs with this one .
she &apos;s a two @-@ faced whore , who will kiss your boyfriend ,
then lie to your face about it .
you know , i hope the next time you go back to juvie ,
that they let you rot in there , bitch .
wait . what are you doing ?
taking my pants off .
why ?
