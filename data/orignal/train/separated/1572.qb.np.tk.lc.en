we should get on the road .
what &apos;s the hurry ?
i &apos;m going to go gas up the car .
you meet me down there as soon as you can .
zachary !
who is that ?
get in the car !
my mom . i &apos;m sorry .
right now ! now !
well , now you know .
know what ?
how weird my mom is .
ok , yeah , she &apos;s a little kooky .
but so what .
i know that you were at school
the night of my photo shoot , making fake ids .
i guess one of the fakes got confiscated last night at a bar .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;ll get you your money back .
what if i moved in ?
maybe when he moves back to his mom &apos;s ,
we can revisit the idea .
so what did you do with the money ?
i mean , since you didn &apos;t give it to callie .
they really want me to testify ,
and i ... i &apos;m scared they &apos;re going to cut off my food stamps .
maybe i can help you .
you &apos;re telling people our ids don &apos;t work ?
i changed my mind .
well , now i &apos;m going to return the favor .
that was amazing .
yeah . except , i can &apos;t keep the triplets
in time with the eighth notes , and i keep missing the sharps .
well , yeah , there &apos;s that , but , um , otherwise ...
i have an audition for the san diego junior symphony .
how did that happen ?
my dad &apos;s girlfriend knows somebody .
wow . symphony ?
junior .
but still , that &apos;s a big deal .
yeah . if i can get the ascending arpeggio right .
but , it &apos;s nice to see you ...
so passionate about your music again .
remember , you brought me up here my first day at anchor beach ?
yeah .
i never thought i &apos;d still be here .
i ... i asked you how you felt
when your moms adopted jesus and mariana .
yeah , i , um ...
i said this was me and my moms ...
... and then the twins came ...
... and then jude ...
... and then ... you .
is that how you feel ?
no .
no . this is ... this is you .
so we got the court date .
we &apos;re getting adopted on monday .
monday .
yeah .
i should , um , let you get that arpeggio ascending .
right . yeah .
do you still hate me ?
well , hate &apos;s a strong word .
how are you ?
i &apos;m good .
you look good .
how would you know ?
wait . what exactly is a &quot; hoosier &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know , and nobody really does .
but everyone in indiana is damn proud to be one .
hey , so , there &apos;s something i &apos;ve been wondering ...
the next morning , at the motel ,
where you kind of freaked out ...
was that because ...
i mean , were you really going for gas ,
or were you trying to get away ,
before lena and stef got there ?
i was trying to get away before they got there .
with you .
but you called them .
i changed my mind .
why ?
you know why .
so you forgive me ?
no , there &apos;s nothing to forgive .
you did the right thing .
what ?
i think you have more hair than me now .
jealous ?
a little .
we are looking for the x intercept
where y is zero .
how &apos;s wrestling without me ?
same as it was with you .
so , if y equals zero ...
so , you don &apos;t miss me at all ?
i miss not being the worst one on the team .
come on , write it down .
look , i really want to help you do this thing , without your meds .
but if you &apos;re not going to try to concentrate ...
ok , ok . i promise i &apos;ll concentrate .
if you &apos;ll go to the winter ball with me .
i have a date .
who ?
none of your business .
what &apos;s his name ?
jesus .
would you like to stay after school ?
would you ?
how about a little more algebra , a little less attitude .
yes , sir .
mariana !
guess who i &apos;m here to see ?
who ?
your mother .
my mother ?
about the dance .
oh my ... did i scare you ?
yeah , a little .
oh , honey , i &apos;m so sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to do that .
mom ?
oh , shoot .
it &apos;s supposed to be a surprise .
what ?
i &apos;m volunteering to be a chaperone at metropolis :
the winter ball !
but don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m all for dirty dancing .
oh ! i got to dash .
don &apos;t want to keep someone &apos;s future mother @-@ in @-@ law waiting .
mom ...
ok .
well , at least she likes me today .
why does everything have to be a surprise ?
yeah , you &apos;d think her mood swings were enough .
sorry .
but , you know , maybe she needs to see a doctor .
no , she doesn &apos;t . she &apos;s ... eccentric .
she called me a whore .
maybe she had a little too much wine .
she doesn &apos;t even remember .
hey , she obviously loves you .
so , speaking of the ball ,
have you thought about ...
are you going ?
not sure . are you going ?
i sort of have to since my mom &apos;s in charge of the whole thing .
oh , right .
uh ... well , i better get to class .
hey . still on nights ?
yep .
do you know for how much longer ?
&apos;cause i really don &apos;t like that brandon &apos;s alone at night .
he &apos;s sixteen .
yeah , exactly .
and he &apos;s not always alone .
dani &apos;s over a lot .
she makes him dinner practically every night .
how &apos;s he doing ?
he &apos;s doing great .
he &apos;s practicing hard for his audition .
he &apos;s really back on track .
well , good . means he can come home soon .
yeah , i &apos;ll tell dani you say thank you .
stefanie foster ?
yeah ?
i &apos;m ana gutierrez ...
i know who you are .
well , we need to talk .
about what ?
about your son .
he gave me money .
to change my story .
to say i wasn &apos;t there the night that your partner killed evan .
you &apos;re out of your mind .
ask him .
i don &apos;t need to .
i &apos;ll tell the da .
unless ...
i want $ 10,000 .
and then you &apos;ll never see me again .
if i do see you again ,
i will arrest you for trying to extort a police officer .
woo ! looking good there , my friend . thank you .
i got to stay in shape
for when i get back on the wrestling team .
oh , yeah ? well , i &apos;ll tell you what , you should try studying
because that &apos;s not going to happen until you get your grades up .
exercise helps me concentrate .
mm @-@ hmm . let me ask you this .
have you considered going back on your meds ?
no .
well , uh , lena mentioned that some of your teachers are concerned
because you &apos;ve been a little on edge lately .
they just don &apos;t want to deal .
you said you &apos;d give me a chance to do this .
it hasn &apos;t been that long .
ok , we &apos;ll give you some more time .
but i want to see a change in your grades and your attitude .
yeah , ok .
ok .
you got some guns there , mom .
yeah , i know , i know . i work out . i got to , right ?
listen , you haven &apos;t , uh ,
you haven &apos;t seen ... ana , have you ?
ana ? no .
not since ... at the hospital .
ok . ok .
why ?
no . just , uh , just checking in .
but if she ever does try to contact you
or your sister , you will let me know right away . yes ?
yeah . ok .
ok .
so how many pull @-@ ups can you do ?
more than you .
oh , please .
you little whippersnapper . get out of the way here .
you just want to see an old lady sweat .
put your money where your mouth is .
i &apos;m going to bed .
you can get ... aw !
i love you .
doesn &apos;t he realize that only like losers go to dances alone ?
i &apos;m going alone .
well , you could ask wyatt . it &apos;s all over school he &apos;s back .
well , he &apos;s not back yet . and he wouldn &apos;t want to go .
well , i can &apos;t believe they &apos;re announcing nominations
for winter king and queen tomorrow
and i don &apos;t even have a date .
maybe zac &apos;s waiting for you to ask him .
why ?
the panty incident ?
oh , my god . can everyone please stop talking about that ?
i &apos;m just saying , he might be gun shy .
his mother was all right with it ?
yeah , i guess he wasn &apos;t happy in indiana
and a friend &apos;s family said he could come and live with them .
and , uh , how do we feel about
wyatt being back in callie &apos;s life ?
he did call us to come get her .
that was the right thing to do .
yeah , but letting her run away with him was not .
i think he &apos;s a good kid .
maybe it &apos;s a good thing ...
... for both callie and brandon .
you think callie &apos;s going to start dating him again ?
it wouldn &apos;t be the worst thing .
honey , that &apos;s ...
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
hey , do you think for one night
we could sleep on a level playing field ?
i &apos;d love to see your beautiful face and not the mattress .
i &apos;ve just got all these baby books to read , honey .
it &apos;s not that complicated . they eat , they cry , they poop .
that &apos;s pretty much all you need to know .
i know we can &apos;t afford a new mattress ,
but what if we can sell this one , huh ?
we could do that .
no , i think it &apos;s illegal to sell a used mattress ?
no , it &apos;s illegal to cut tags off pillows .
why is that ?
i don &apos;t know .
look , i hate this crack between the two of us .
we barely cuddle anymore . hello , over there .
i think we should keep it .
you know , it &apos;ll be great when i &apos;m pregnant .
adjust the position , be more comfortable .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
someday we &apos;ll be intimate again .
it &apos;s fine , it &apos;s fine .
honey , we were intimate last week , when we inseminated .
nothing intimate about that .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t ...
you barely touched your dinner .
uh ... sorry . i ... wasn &apos;t hungry .
you want to talk about it ?
callie and jude are getting adopted on monday .
like , officially .
is that what &apos;s bothering you ?
no . i mean , i want her to get adopted .
it &apos;s just ,
the guy she ran away with ,
he &apos;s back , i guess .
what &apos;s the story with him ?
they dated , um , when she started at anchor beach .
nothing serious .
well , if she starts seeing him again ,
you only have yourself to blame .
you moved in with your dad to give yourself some space ,
to get over callie .
but all you &apos;re really doing
is giving her the space to get over you .
if she hasn &apos;t already .
well , what am i supposed to do ?
i mean , i just ...
tell her .
tell her that you &apos;re not going to get over each other .
look . why don &apos;t i get your dad
to take me to a movie tomorrow night
before he goes into work .
you guys can have the place to yourself for a couple of hours .
to talk , or , you know ... whatever .
you have to convince her it &apos;s not too late .
莉娜说只需填写你所在的家庭的联系信息就可以返校咯
hey ! hey , no , wait !
i &apos;m here ! i &apos;m here !
so , i was going to wait for you to ask me ,
but then callie made me realize ...
whoa , stop .
follow me .
open it .
what is this ?
mystery date . you know , the board game .
is it new ?
no . it &apos;s like , old . it &apos;s really old .
it was my mom &apos;s favorite game from when she was a girl .
i told her you wouldn &apos;t get it .
well , what &apos;s the mystery ?
well , see , you don &apos;t know who &apos;s behind the door .
it could be your dream date
or , you know , a bum .
so , which are you ?
hopefully not a bum .
my mom thought that it would be a &quot; charming &quot; way
of asking you to be my date to the winter ball .
it is charming .
and yes !
you ok ?
yeah , he &apos;s just ...
holding a grudge ?
i guess . i don &apos;t know .
he promised some great revenge ,
but so far , it &apos;s been keying my car and bumping into me .
well , let &apos;s hope that &apos;s as far as it goes .
uh , so , i was , uh , wondering if ...
can you come over after school ? to my dad &apos;s ?
why ? what &apos;s up ?
well , no , there &apos;s just something i need you to hear .
oh , for your audition ?
i could meet you in the music room at lunch ?
actually , it kind of needs to be at my dad &apos;s .
ok . well , i have group ,
so i could stop by after , like around 4 : 30 .
ok . yeah . see you then .
good morning , anchor beach .
the votes are in and it &apos;s time to announce
your nominees for winter king and queen .
starting with ladies first : paige blyers ...
oh my god ! you are so going to win !
... talya banks , and ...
... callie jacob .
callie jacob ? is that a joke ?
i think you &apos;d make a great queen .
i &apos;m taking my name off the ballot .
it &apos;s only a joke if you let it get to you .
you should act like , hell yeah , i got nominated ,
and then , the joke &apos;s on them .
well , that is a very enlightened way of looking at it .
i &apos;m a very enlightened guy .
i guess i &apos;m not .
hey , um , how about a ride to group , guru wy ?
unfortunately , i &apos;m not so enlightened
when it comes to reading parking signs .
my car got towed this morning
and i don &apos;t have $ 150 to get it out .
what about your friend &apos;s parents ?
can &apos;t they help you out ?
he actually didn &apos;t ask his parents
if i could live with them until i got here .
he thought they &apos;d feel obligated
if i just showed up on their doorstep .
turns out , they didn &apos;t .
so , where have you been living ?
* because i &apos;m just an outlaw *
演唱者 david lambert
* wanted , if you want me *
* i love you every day and every night *
* love , love , love is my cry *
* so , baby , come catch me *
* and let &apos;s do the time *
抱歉 来不了 以后解释
he &apos;s been living in his car . he &apos;s got no place to stay .
i ain &apos;t allowed no roommates .
it &apos;s just for a few nights . please ?
all right .
it &apos;s cool .
so , how do you know her ?
well , mostly from the group home i was in .
after juvie .
she &apos;s good people .
hey , um , i &apos;ve got to get home . i &apos;ll call you later , ok ?
we &apos;ll figure something out . don &apos;t worry .
you hungry ?
uh , yeah . thanks .
it &apos;s hot .
thanks .
so , callie says you guys met at a group home ?
met again .
you met before that ?
in juvie .
i beat her up .
i &apos;m not going to the stupid winter ball .
sorry , lena .
and i &apos;m taking my name off the ballot .
we can do that .
i still think you should go , though .
why ?
what ?
principal sanchez did not give a very positive progress report
to your parole officer .
what did she say ?
that you are not making friends ,
and not participating in school activities .
well , she should write
that the kids at school are making fun of me .
you don &apos;t know that for sure .
i wish people were making fun of me .
mariana ...
if that meant
i was getting nominated for winter queen .
at least people know who you are .
have you ever seen that movie carrie ?
jesus . really ?
where &apos;s jude , by the way ?
he &apos;s having dinner at connor &apos;s tonight .
what if you didn &apos;t take your name off the ballot ?
wouldn &apos;t that look good to your p.o. ,
if the kids at school were nominating you ?
as a joke .
he wouldn &apos;t know that .
and if it is a joke ,
you &apos;d have the last laugh , wouldn &apos;t you ?
that &apos;s what wyatt said .
i think he &apos;s right .
you know , when i was in school the kids used to call me &quot; oreo . &quot;
because i &apos;m bi @-@ racial .
that &apos;s lame .
not as lame as when they found out i was a lesbian .
是对肤色和性向的讽刺
then they called me a &quot; klon @-@ dyke bar . &quot;
that &apos;s not funny .
it &apos;s not funny . it &apos;s mean . it &apos;s very mean .
so , what did you do about it ?
well , i brought a hundred klondike bars to school one day ,
i passed them out to all the kids ,
and they never called me that again .
that &apos;s kind of awesome .
sometimes , the best way to fight back is to rise above .
演唱者 starshook
how &apos;s business ?
it &apos;s pretty good . there &apos;s a run on punch .
can i get some of that ?
thank you for getting me this gig .
now i &apos;ll be able to get my car back .
thank lena .
hey , how &apos;s it going at daphne &apos;s ?
she hasn &apos;t tried to beat me up . yet .
people change .
that &apos;s true .
look at you , you &apos;re at the winter ball ,
nominated for winter queen .
you even kept your name on the ballot .
yeah . i &apos;m &quot; rising above . &quot;
and i &apos;m pouring punch .
maybe you &apos;ll dance with me later ?
maybe .
after they get a ballot , they get a stamp on their wrist ,
so that they can &apos;t vote again .
ok , i got it . no ballot stuffing .
this isn &apos;t florida . i &apos;m all over it .
great , thank you .
you really knocked yourself out this year .
yeah . the kids seem to be having a great time , right ?
i wish callie was .
she &apos;s here . that &apos;s what counts .
oh . and nominated for winter queen .
yeah , the kids must be really taking a liking to her .
oh , my son is here . excuse me .
i was beginning to think you weren &apos;t going to show .
you really know how to throw a party .
thank you .
uh , brandon , will you do me a favor ?
could you ask callie to dance ?
brothers can ask sisters to dance , right ?
i just ... i don &apos;t really feel like dancing right now .
brandon , please ?
and if you could dance near principal sanchez ,
that would be great .
i &apos;ll be right back .
kyle dumbass , really ?
i &apos;m just saying , you could do better .
god knows i &apos;ve done worse .
i thought you bailed .
you want to dance ?
it &apos;s ok . lena asked me to ask you .
something about looking like you &apos;re having fun ?
right .
yeah , thanks .
hey , i just voted for you !
thanks !
hey , let me in .
what &apos;s up ?
this the place ?
close the door .
awesome .
well , to callie jacob .
yeah , callie jacob .
can we go somewhere and talk ?
ok .
oh , man .
that &apos;s awesome .
演唱者 starshook
may i ?
oh , um , sure .
i know what &apos;s going on .
what ?
i &apos;m not a fool .
i know you &apos;re screwing her .
what i don &apos;t understand is how you can flaunt it
in front of all our friends .
mom ...
i won &apos;t be humiliated , zachary . i won &apos;t .
what happened ?
i &apos;m sorry .
just this whole winter queen thing
is making me feel really uncomfortable .
honestly , i am so tired of being judged .
i &apos;m tired , too .
of what ?
of being here whenever you need my shoulder to cry on .
what about when i need you ?
what about when i needed to talk to you the other day
and you just blew me off ?
i didn &apos;t , i ... i was with wyatt .
oh good , that makes me feel so much better .
he was living in his car , so i took him to daphne &apos;s .
then why don &apos;t you get a place together or something ?
i mean , that was the plan , right ?
if you &apos;d made it to indiana .
where &apos;s this coming from ?
i &apos;m still in love with you .
don &apos;t .
we can &apos;t ...
yes , we can .
you can still get adopted .
and ... i &apos;ll stay at my dad &apos;s .
we can see each other there .
behind everybody &apos;s backs ?
then we &apos;ll wait till we &apos;re 18 ...
brandon , i &apos;m going to be your sister .
we &apos;re not related .
we don &apos;t share the same blood .
there &apos;s nothing wrong or illegal about that .
so ...
if you &apos;re not really my brother ,
then stef and lena won &apos;t really be my mothers .
no , it &apos;s not the same .
it &apos;s exactly the same .
i need a family .
not a piece of paper .
if that &apos;s what adoption is , then what &apos;s the point ?
hey , i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean ...
we can &apos;t keep doing this .
but we do . we keep doing this .
because what we feel , happens once in a lifetime .
you have to let me go .
we have to fight for it .
please .
then , help me .
tell me you don &apos;t love me anymore .
tell me something to make me get over you .
i had sex with wyatt .
when we ran away , we stayed in the same motel room .
slept in the same bed .
in the middle of the night , i curled up next to him .
we were half asleep ... it just happened .
if i can have everyone &apos;s attention , please .
can all the nominees for winter king and queen
please come up on stage ?
her car &apos;s still here .
that &apos;s a good thing , i guess .
go back in the party . i &apos;ll find her .
not alone you won &apos;t .
your votes have been counted
and your winter king and queen are ...
... vico cerar !
and your queen is ...
... callie jacob .
cal @-@ lie , cal @-@ lie , cal @-@ lie !
so , how does it feel to be winter king and queen ?
uh ... awesome !
callie ? do you have anything to say ?
this is such an honor .
i want to thank everyone who voted for me
and just say from the bottom of my heart ,
how thrilled i am to be your winter queen .
cal @-@ lie ! cal @-@ lie ! cal @-@ lie !
演唱者 starshook
what &apos;s going on in here ?
she ... just ... she doesn &apos;t feel well .
get out here , right now .
where did this alcohol come from ?
callie jacob bought it , so we &apos;d vote for her .
i didn &apos;t even want to be winter queen .
you could have fooled me .
no , i was just ...
she wanted to take her name off the ballot .
then why didn &apos;t she ?
we encouraged her not to .
we thought it might look good to her parole officer .
oh , and winning would look even better .
how would she even buy alcohol ? she &apos;s 16 years old .
she could have a fake id .
i don &apos;t have a fake id .
you can search my purse . i &apos;ll go get it right now .
karina . what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m being set up .
by whom ?
i don &apos;t know .
slow your roll there .
what do you want ?
how about your car keys .
jesus ...
he &apos;s drunk .
look , dude , just mind your own business .
let him go !
i just want his keys !
get off him ! he &apos;s not driving ! ok ?
i am !
i was just ...
being a jerk ! just stay away from me !
mom ?
hello .
are you ok ?
i &apos;m fine .
let &apos;s go home .
home ? i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sorry ... do i know you ?
it &apos;s me .
zac .
your ... your son .
that &apos;s not mine .
it &apos;s got your picture and your name on it .
let me see .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m going to have to call the police .
i &apos;m going to keep this . like wear it every day .
hey , you think you can get to me by hurting callie ?
you seem pretty upset about it .
she could get sent back to juvie !
which would break your heart , wouldn &apos;t it ?
all i have to do is tell them
you set her up because i bought back the ids .
what ids ? the kids we sold to aren &apos;t going to talk ,
so it &apos;s your word against mine .
she didn &apos;t do anything to you .
well , she did ask me to make her a fake id . which i did .
and when they check her phone ,
they &apos;ll see she texted a few kids to spread the word
about the complimentary booze in the bathroom ...
get your hands off me !
what the hell is going on here ?
get out of my face !
if you know what &apos;s going down with callie ,
you need to do something , now .
卫生间有我请大家喝的免费酒 传播下这个消息
can you think of any reason
someone would go through all this trouble
to make this fake id and plant it in your purse ?
callie , you need to tell the truth .
we don &apos;t know that she &apos;s not .
i &apos;d like to see those texts , please .
brandon , not now .
i know who did this .
oh , yeah ? who ?
it was me .
be very careful what you say right now , brandon .
i set callie up .
i planted the fake id in her purse .
i sent texts from her phone . i bought the alcohol .
everything .
brandon ...
he &apos;s obviously trying to protect her .
no . i &apos;m not .
i wanted to hurt her because she hurt me .
she led me on and made me believe she cared about me .
and she lied .
so , i wanted to send her back to juvie
so we wouldn &apos;t adopt her .
how did you buy the alcohol ?
with this .
i took your key and made the ids on the machine at school .
why come forward now ?
because i realized tonight that i was wrong .
she didn &apos;t lead me on ...
don &apos;t do this .
let me talk , callie .
i realized tonight that you didn &apos;t lead me on .
you just never felt the way i did . not really .
it was all in my head .
and i should &apos;ve accepted what you kept telling me .
what you needed . what you wanted .
it was never me .
what do you want me to do ?
arrest him .
every student will be subjected to a sobriety test ...
wait . what &apos;s going on ? brandon ? !
are you ok ?
brandon !
callie , stay back .
it wasn &apos;t true .
what i said about wyatt , it was not true .
where is he ?
he &apos;s still in the car .
i talked to the guys who brought brandon in .
they don &apos;t want to do the paperwork on this .
you better start talking ,
and i don &apos;t want one more lie to come out of your mouth .
i did take the key ...
... and i did make fake ids with vico .
but then , i realized it was a mistake ,
so i bought them all back .
and , um ... and then he got pissed .
and he set up callie to get back at me .
why would you make fake ids ?
to sell them .
yes , i realize that .
why ?
i needed the money to pay you back
for all the piano lessons i didn &apos;t go to .
you paid me back .
dani gave me that money .
to give to you .
what happened to your father &apos;s money ?
i gave it to ana .
you gave the money to ana ?
why ?
to change her story .
so you wouldn &apos;t go on trial .
