hey , want to spend some time
playing the new star wars game this weekend ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
i kind of promised myself i &apos;d get off the computer ,
be more physically active . get some exercise ...
you &apos;re about to walk up three flights of stairs .
good point , i &apos;m in .
you know what would be great ?
let &apos;s do it like the old days .
you mean , are you talking gaming marathon ?
yeah . start saturday morning ,
go 48 hours ,
sleeping bags , junk food ...
turn off our phones so our moms can &apos;t call .
it would be like our world of warcraft a few years ago
when the neighbors called the cops on us .
they called the cops because of the smell .
they thought we were dead .
we were badass back in the day .
all right , let &apos;s do it .
48 hours of star wars gaming .
it &apos;s on like alderaan .
hey , sheldon , clear your weekend .
starting saturday morning , star wars marathon .
movies or video games ?
no , board game ?
or trading card games ?
or lego &apos;s ? or dress up ?
or comic books ? !
or dramatic readings of novelizations ? !
yes to all !
we are going to play the online game .
the online game ? !
bully !
gentlemen , as much as i &apos;m sure sheldon would enjoy
playing intergalactic make @-@ believe ,
he and i have other plans .
we are attending my aunt flora &apos;s 93rd birthday party .
just tell her i can &apos;t come .
she &apos;ll be disappointed if we don &apos;t show up .
she &apos;s 93 .
she won &apos;t be disappointed for very long .
no , hang on . i followed all the protocols
set forth by you in the relationship agreement .
i made a written record request 72 hours in advance .
i checked the tire pressure on the car .
i even contacted the centers for disease control to find out
what shots they recommend for travel to orange county .
fyi , it &apos;s none .
amy , the relationship agreement was not designed
for either one of us to get our way .
you use it to get your way .
i use it to get the right way .
the fact that the right way is also my way
is a happy coincidence .
you gave me your word .
you &apos;re coming with me .
we &apos;ll miss you , sheldon .
yeah , well ,
who wants to spend the whole weekend ,
running around a bunch of pretend planets
battling made up monsters .
that &apos;s for babies .
yeah , but it &apos;s got lightsabers .
yeah , please , amy ! it &apos;s got lightsabers !
hello , stewart .
hey , sheldon .
help you with anything ?
yes , i &apos;m attending a party this weekend
for a 93 @-@ year @-@ old woman .
can you recommend a gift ?
uh , i don &apos;t know .
could put a tennis ball on the end of excalibur .
make a pretty badass cane .
do you supply the tennis ball ?
no .
then no .
what else ?
oh , have this collectors edition batman utility belt .
maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy .
well , she &apos;d just look silly wearing that
without the rest of the costume .
i &apos;m sorry sheldon , that &apos;s it . that &apos;s all i got .
oh , it &apos;s not your fault .
i &apos;ve been to the model train store .
i &apos;ve been to radio shack .
this woman is impossible to shop for .
i &apos;d make fun of sheldon for having girl problems
if i wasn &apos;t in shock that sheldon has girl problems .
no , leonard , go ahead and mock .
like my daddy always said ,
&quot; shelly , women aren &apos;t anything but flippin &apos; pains in the bottom . &quot;
that &apos;s what your father used to say ?
well , i took out the bad words and the yeehaw ,
but you get the gist .
look , if you don &apos;t want to go to the party , just don &apos;t go .
you &apos;re a grown man .
act like one .
tell amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover
and playing video games with your friends .
maybe she &apos;ll dig it .
women like a firm hand on the tiller .
i can never find the tiller .
i got a book ; it didn &apos;t help .
yeah , i always thought if i were ever enslaved ,
it would be by an advanced species from another planet ,
not some hotsy @-@ totsy from glendale .
now , i downloaded an app that
might be helpful in this situation .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m smart as a whip .
i should be able to figure this out .
hey , listen , i kind of made plans
with the guys this weekend , but then i wondered ,
because we &apos;re in this relationship @-@ beta @-@ test ,
if i should have asked you first .
then i thought if i did check with you first ,
then you &apos;d think that i was taking things to seriously .
and then @-@ en i got a nosebleed .
you don &apos;t have to check with me .
do whatever you want .
i guess i was hoping for a different reaction , but okay .
really , what were you hoping for ?
i don &apos;t know ,
maybe that you &apos;d be a little upset ,
and then you &apos;d realize that
i &apos;m a stallion that has to run free .
and that would turn you on a little .
okay , i &apos;m an actress . ask me again .
do you mind if i spend the weekend
playing video games with the guys ?
wha ... the entire weekend ?
you mean i wouldn &apos;t see you at all ?
but i j ...
no , no ...
i knew what i was getting into .
you can &apos;t put a saddle on leonard hofstadter .
oh , my , is it getting hot in here ?
ay , papi .
ay , papi ?
what is that ?
an acting choice .
so you chose that when you become turned on ,
you turn into speedy gonzalez ?
choo got a problem with that , papi ?
penny ! penny ! penny !
sorry , stallion .
your weird friend giraffe is here .
hello , penny !
i just stopped by to bring you this gift .
gummy bears ? thank you .
now that you &apos;re in my debt ...
... please manipulate amy into releasing me
from my commitment to attend her aunt &apos;s tedious birthday party .
not a chance .
all right .
i thought the candy might not be enough
so let me up the ante .
these are cooper coupons .
these are for various things i can do for you .
um , oh , this one
is for one free grammar check .
you could use it for emails , letters ,
tattoos , what have you .
oh , this is fun one !
this is an afternoon with me at the california science center ,
where i point out their mistakes .
keep an eye on those expiration dates ,
i &apos;ve been burned more than once .
all right , sweetie , i &apos;m not going to get involved
in your relationship .
oh , come on . it &apos;s just a simple favor .
now , when &apos;s the last time i asked you
to do something for me ?
yesterday . you made me look in your ear
to see if there was a ladybug in it .
when is the last time i asked you to do something
that wasn &apos;t a medical emergency ?
yesterday . you made me look in your ear
to see if there was a ladybug in it .
all right , then , i have no choice
but to go on to plan b.
what &apos;s that ?
i &apos;m going to run around outside
with a wet head and try to catch a cold .
good morning .
hello .
i think you &apos;re really going to enjoy yourself today .
not only do you get to meet my relatives ,
but since my aunt &apos;s nursing home is catering the party ,
all of the food is incredibly soft .
it &apos;s like a vacation for your teeth .
all right .
you sure you &apos;re okay with this ?
yes .
i decided to find a way
that i could have this experience and enjoy it .
thank you . that means a lot to me .
oh , don &apos;t thank me .
thank wireless technology .
i realized , i can go to your aunt &apos;s awful party
and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends .
sheldon , my relatives are going to want to talk to you ,
and you &apos;re going to be sitting there playing a game ?
isn &apos;t that a little rude ?
oh , i got that covered .
headset .
i won &apos;t hear a word the old geezers are saying .
you know , if playing that game is more important to you
than honoring your commitment to me ,
and you don &apos;t mind me showing up at a party all by myself
after i &apos;ve already told everybody i &apos;ll be bringing somebody ,
then , fine .
go home and play your game .
thanks .
ooh , listen ,
i wouldn &apos;t mind a piece of birthday cake ,
provided the old gal &apos;s candle blow is clean and dry .
here you go .
i &apos;ve got everything we &apos;ll need for the big game :
low @-@ fat turkey jerky ...
low @-@ carb beer ...
100 @-@ calorie snack pack ...
you pick up a y chromosome while you were there ?
缺乏y染色体可能导致发育为娘娘腔
you might be short one .
hey , i plan on leveling up in the game ,
not my swimsuit size , thank you very much .
gentlemen , the game offers us a choice ,
between playing for the republic and the light side ,
or the sith empire and the dark side .
well , we &apos;re always the good guys .
in d &amp; d , we &apos;re lawful good ,
in city of heroes , we &apos;re the heroes ,
and grand theft auto ,
we pay the prostitutes promptly ,
and never hit them with a bat .
those women are prostitutes ?
you said they were raising money for stem cell research .
hey , guys , i got a surprise .
hm , if it &apos;s yogurt that helps ladies poop ,
i think raj beat you to it .
no . bernadette &apos;s going to be playing with us .
so , that &apos;s pretty cool , huh ? right ? sure it is , yeah .
what , you invited your girlfriend ? !
this is supposed to be our weekend !
i had no choice . last night , she said ,
&quot; why don &apos;t we go out for brunch tomorrow
and then maybe the arboretum . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , no ,
i promised the guys i was going to
play a video game with them all weekend . &quot;
and she said , &quot; that sounds like fun .
can i come , too ? &quot;
and then i didn &apos;t answer for a second , and then she said ,
&quot; well , do you not want me to come ? &quot;
and then i bought her a new laptop and the game ,
and she &apos;s parking the car right now .
is the whip sound app
contextually appropriate here ?
uh , it is , but i think you might &apos;ve waited too long
for it to be funny .
i was wrong ; it &apos;s still funny .
oh , good .
amy , what &apos;s wrong ?
my boyfriend &apos;s a jerk .
well , i know he didn &apos;t cheat on you ,
so what happened ?
i had to go to my aunt &apos;s party all by myself ,
and everybody was like ,
&quot; where &apos;s this boyfriend you &apos;re always talking about ?
&quot; is he real , or did you make him up like armen ,
the miniature horse breeder ? &quot;
who &apos;s armen the miniature horse breeder ?
the pretend boyfriend i invented to get my family off my back .
it unraveled quickly when i couldn &apos;t answer the question
&quot; how &apos;d you two meet ? &quot;
i would have thought at a miniature horse show .
oh , that &apos;s good .
i panicked and said woodstock .
i just wanted to show sheldon off to my family .
sure , i get that .
i mean , he &apos;s your first boyfriend and all .
not just my first boyfriend , he &apos;s the best boyfriend .
i mean , think about it .
i &apos;m dating sheldon cooper .
yes .
on purpose .
he &apos;s handsome , he &apos;s lanky ,
he &apos;s brilliant ,
and his skin has that pale , waxy quality .
well , sickly is the new sexy .
yeah .
you know , amy ,
sometimes when you &apos;re in a relationship with someone
you really care about , the sucky part is ,
it leaves you open to getting hurt .
do you ever worry about leonard doing that to you ?
that &apos;s hilarious . no .
get that guy ! get that guy !
dr. rostenkowski ,
it may interest you to know
that saying &quot; pew , pew , pew &quot; isn &apos;t as effective
as pressing your blaster key .
in the same way that saying &quot; whee ! &quot;
doesn &apos;t make the land speeder go .
raj , imperial troopers on your tail .
got him .
when gandhi advocated his philosophy of non @-@ violence ,
i bet he didn &apos;t know how much fun it was killing stuff .
all right , i think we got them all .
let &apos;s divide up the loot .
ooh , look at this pretty purple robe i just got .
you should put on yours and then we &apos;ll match .
but i worked hard to get this armor .
sorry , i just thought it &apos;d be nice
if people knew we were a couple .
fine , i &apos;ll change .
i don &apos;t think i want to play a game .
oh , come on !
they &apos;re playing one across the hall-- we should , too .
okay , we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter
off the table , and if it goes into this cup ,
the other person has to drink .
then you get to go again ...
like that ?
wow . yeah , b @-@ beginner &apos;s luck .
so , now i will drink this entire cup of beer ,
and you will go again ...
all right .
so , yeah , okay , now i &apos;m gonna drink this entire cup
and then i &apos;m going to drink another one .
okay , seriously , stop . what the hell ?
spent a lot of my childhood
throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends .
at a certain point , you start doing trick shots
just to keep things interesting .
whoa , give me a second to catch up here . hold on .
that &apos;d be my boyfriend
happier playing his dopey star trek game with his friends
than hanging out with me .
wars .
what ?
star wars .
they get all cranky when you mix the two up .
what &apos;s the difference ?
there &apos;s absolutely no difference .
how do i get him to treat me better ?
all right .
let me give you a little girlfriend 101 .
usually the first move out of the gate
is you withhold sex ,
but that will work better after sheldon hits puberty .
so , i &apos;d say ...
give him the silent treatment .
no , he loves that .
our record for sitting in a room together
and not speaking to each other is six @-@ and @-@ a half hours .
he said it was a magical evening .
all right , then we &apos;re gonna have to go
with an oldie but goodie ;
making a scene .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;d be good at that .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re lucky to have me .
back in omaha , there are two different restaurants
i &apos;m not allowed into . both chili &apos;s .
bernadette , remember , your character &apos;s the healer in our group .
you &apos;re in charge of healing all of us , not just howard .
i can &apos;t help it .
my howie wowie has an owie .
that is the most sickeningly sweet thing
i have ever experienced .
and i am sipping kool @-@ aid through a red vine .
sheldon cooper , i &apos;ve got a bone to pick with you ,
and i &apos;m about to do it in front of all your friends .
yeah , you pick that bone . you pick that bone clean !
i &apos;m gonna publicly shame you ,
and then sit back as societal pressure
compels you to modify your behavior .
ooh , buuurn !
and if you don &apos;t start treating me better ,
i &apos;m leaving you
for a miniature horse breeder named armen .
armen who ?
armen ... damn it .
look , sheldon , she wanted to show you off to her family ,
and you stood her up , okay ?
look at this adorable , smushy face .
smush , smush , smush .
you &apos;re hurting me .
no , sheldon hurt you .
before ; now it &apos;s you .
i think i understand .
you &apos;re the one person
who can say sheldon cooper is your boyfriend ,
but that rings hollow
if you can &apos;t lord him over others in the flesh .
i forget what i bring to the party
and what i take away when i leave .
please accept these valuable cooper coupons ...
... as restitution .
sheldon , she doesn &apos;t want your stupid ...
ooh , science center . redeeming .
let &apos;s go .
well played , amy farrah fowler .
let me get my coat .
oh , grow up , leonard .
but e @-@ excuse me ,
i have something to say .
none of you may realize it ,
but i was very much looking forward to this weekend .
it was gonna be like the old days--
the four of us hanging out playing video games
before you guys all got girlfriends .
do you have any idea what it &apos;s like
to be the only one without a girlfriend ?
even if i get one someday ,
i &apos;ll still be the guy who got a girl after sheldon cooper !
and that &apos;s how a girl makes a scene .
i &apos;m sorry , sweetie .
you &apos;re right . you deserve your weekend .
come on , amy , let &apos;s go .
what about the science center ?
i &apos;ll let you hold my hair while i throw up .
rain check .
i &apos;m gonna go , too .
i &apos;ll miss you .
i &apos;ll miss you .
i &apos;ll miss you more .
no , i &apos;ll ...
just leave !
okay , now .
this is the way it &apos;s supposed to be .
men together , fighting the forces of evil .
hear ! hear !
i can &apos;t believe this is only 64 calories .
howard joel wolowitz !
i &apos;ve been worried sick for two days ,
and i know you turned off your phone !
you open up this door right now
because i &apos;ve had it up to here !
i have been to the morgue and the hospital ,
and i spent the last half hour
walking up these ferkakta stairs !
that &apos;s my ride ; got to go .
