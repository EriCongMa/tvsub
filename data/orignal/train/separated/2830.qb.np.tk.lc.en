come on , no peeking .
our eyes are closed , and we &apos;re crossing the street . very good .
okay . open up !
what do you want to show us ?
because all i can see is this bitchen van !
it &apos;s for our catering business .
i think i know that girl .
we won &apos;t keep it this way , though .
we &apos;ll replace the sword with a baguette .
oh , my god , i think i lost my virginity in that van .
also , we don &apos;t know what to do with this .
oh yeah , i definitely know her .
the one where they &apos;re going to party !
remember that guy from cooking school that put cilantro in everything ?
sure , cilantro larry !
i &apos;m filling in for him as food critic for the chelsea reporter .
what an amazing opportunity to influence ...
... dozens of people !
what about our catering business ?
it &apos;s just one night a week .
plus , i get to take you out for free dinners .
well , in that case ....
that was me , hopping on board .
hey , guys . hey , ross !
quick question for you .
are you ready to party ?
i could maybe go out for a couple of beers .
there &apos;s this thing about bees on the discovery channel .
i don &apos;t think you heard me . are you ready ...
... to party ?
no.gandalf ? gandalf is coming to town ?
i have nothing to do , so tomorrow we are partying with gandalf , dude !
dude , we are so going to party !
wow , okay . dude alert !
who is this guy ?
mike &quot; gandalf &quot; ganderson . only the funnest guy in the world .
i &apos;ll call to get off work tomorrow .
i &apos;ll call after you !
this will be so cool ! we never party anymore .
were you smoking something in the back of our van ?
&quot; we never have fun anymore &quot; ? you have fun with me .
remember those strippers ? and you paid me $ 50 to eat that book ?
you are going to love this guy . gandalf is the party wizard .
why do you call him &quot; gandalf &quot; ?
gandalf the wizard .
didn &apos;t you read lord of the rings in high school ?
no , i had sex in high school .
joanna ? i was wondering if i could ask you something .
there &apos;s an opening for a buyer in junior miss
that &apos;d be a step down for me .
actually , i meant for me .
the hiring committee is meeting people all day and ....
i guess you can &apos;t stay my assistant forever .
neither can you , sophie , but for different reasons .
i &apos;m so glad you don &apos;t have a problem . if you did , i wouldn &apos;t apply .
in that case
that &apos;s why i &apos;m glad there &apos;s no problem .
i &apos;m on the hiring committee , so there &apos;ll be one friendly face .
that &apos;s great !
junior miss is where i started .
i slept with the ugliest guy to get that job .
really ?
no .
yeah .
i mean , no .
with your qualifications , you won &apos;t need to sleep with some guy .
although i might need some convincing .
kidding !
god , i feel wild today !
man , i am so excited , i may vomit .
will you calm down ? he &apos;s just a human guy .
you don &apos;t understand . he &apos;s amazing .
you never know what &apos;ll happen .
you go out for beer and end up on a boat to nova scotia .
really ?
it &apos;s beautiful country up there .
hey . okay.i got my passport , fresh socks , and a snakebite kit .
it won &apos;t be exactly like last time .
i &apos;ll see you guys .
i have an audition , but i &apos;ll meet you .
where will you be around noon ?
somewhere maybe along the equator ?
okey
hello .
it &apos;s gandalf !
so are you in town ?
oh , well ....
maybe next time , then .
what happened ?
he can &apos;t come . he &apos;s stuck in chicago .
oh , man !
chicago &apos;s so lucky .
stupid , useless ...
... canadian money !
you have a very impressive resume , miss greene .
i especially like what i see about implementing a new filing system .
thank you .
filing system ? those colored labels you put on all the folders ?
it did brighten up the filing cabinets .
they did more than that .
i notice you &apos;ve been entrusted with a lot of important responsibilities .
joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me .
rachel has been incredible at getting my bagels .
she gets it right almost every time .
of course , i have more responsibilities than that .
of course ! there &apos;s the coffee too .
rachel can carry two things at once .
that &apos;s very good .
now a big part of this job is ...
... cultivating personal relationships , especially with designers .
yes , l
she shouldn &apos;t have any problem .
her only problem might be getting too friendly , you know ?
i love working with designers .
with them . under them . what &apos;s the difference ?
my first review is out .
the chelsea reporter .
these used to keep me so warm .
look , i &apos;m on the back page .
&quot; would i go back to allesandro &apos;s ? sure , i &apos;d get two meals .
one for me , and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head . &quot;
you really laid into this place .
they don &apos;t pay me a penny a word to make friends .
i found a guy who &apos;d fix up the van for catering .
you want me to go ?
it &apos;s okay . are we sure we don &apos;t want the waterbed ?
because it would be silly to take it out if we &apos;re just gonna put it back in again .
haven &apos;t we made this decision ?
yeah , all right .
bye.bye
who is it ?
it &apos;s allesandro , from allesandro &apos;s .
oh , my god .
i want to talk to you about your review .
oh , my god ...
call me on the phone .
what ? so you can hang up on me ?
i &apos;ll never let you up , so just go away .
just give me a chance to
do you need to get in ?
no , phoebe !
hey , monica !
i want a retraction . our food is not &quot; inedible swill . &quot;
i couldn &apos;t eat it .
my five friends couldn &apos;t eat it , and one of them eats books .
our service isn &apos;t &quot; grossly incompetent . &quot;
the waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants .
well , you said that we accept the discover card ...
... which we do not !
all right , that i &apos;ll retract .
but i stand by my review . i know food , and that wasn &apos;t it .
your marinara sauce tastes like tomato juice .
you should serve it with vodka and celery .
i &apos;m proud of that sauce . it &apos;s delicious .
you own an ltalian restaurant , and you think that tastes good ?
where are you from ?
lebanon .
hand me those tomatoes .
i &apos;ll show you what it should taste like .
how long will this take ? i got another critic to yell at .
joanna , i want to talk about that interview .
i thought it went very well .
no , it didn &apos;t . that &apos;s what i want to talk to you about .
now just to brief you ...
... i may cry .
but they are not tears of sadness or of anger ...
... but just of us having this discussion .
please , don &apos;t make a scene .
there &apos;s nobody here .
sophie , get in here .
see ? you &apos;re making sophie uncomfortable .
no , she &apos;s not .
congratulations . you crossed the line into completely useless . get out .
do you want me to quit ?
what makes you think that ?
those things you said in the interview ...
... if you believe them , i must not be a good assistant .
you know what ?
i am just going to pack up my desk ...
... and i will be gone by the end of the day .
there &apos;s no use staying till the end of the day .
wait , wait .
you can put your sad little muffin back .
if you must know the truth , i didn &apos;t want to lose a good assistant .
what ?
that &apos;s why i said those things about your flirting and drinking .
my drinking ?
i must have said that after you left .
said what , exactly ?
you enjoy the occasional drink ...
... -ing binge .
oh , my god ! that is it . i &apos;m leaving !
you are just a horrible person !
wait , wait .
if you &apos;re going to get all sensitive about it .
i don &apos;t want to lose you .
what if i create a position for you ?
i &apos;ll make you assistant buyer in this department .
say more things like that .
your own office and a raise , effective tomorrow .
i need an expense account .
done !
and an assistant .
sophie !
hey , i thought you &apos;d be out partying with gandol- ...
... -dorf .
it &apos;s gandalf , and he &apos;s not coming .
you &apos;ve been sitting here all day ?
i balanced my checkbook .
and i gave first names to all the foosball players .
i can &apos;t believe he didn &apos;t come .
so what ? we can still go out and party ourselves .
with gandalf , we &apos;d be out all night .
we &apos;d meet total strangers and hang out with them .
we could do that .
there was other stuff too .
we &apos;ll do it all and better !
after tonight , gandalf will want to party with us , dude !
it &apos;s not like we don &apos;t know how to party !
all right ! let &apos;s go .
maybe we could end up on a boat again ?
all right !
when were we on a boat ?
remember that cold morning with those dogs licking your face ?
those were seals , man .
how would this suit look on an assistant buyer
the owner of allesandro &apos;s came to yell at me .
but i made him sauce , and he offered me the job as head chef !
you just ruined the thing i was practicing , but i &apos;m so happy !
can you believe it ? i get to run my own kitchen !
oh , you &apos;ve waited so long .
pheebs ! quick question for you .
how would this suit look ...
... on an assistant buyer at bloomingdale &apos;s ?
it would totally depend on her coloring and ....
you got the job !
you got the job ? why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
it &apos;ll be so great ! i &apos;ll help decide what we sell .
i &apos;ll have an office with walls and everything .
i &apos;m going to have walls !
is this the day of good news or what ? i got us a job .
the wedding reception .
i kind of need to talk to you about that .
i think it &apos;s time for me to take a step back from the catering .
but we &apos;ve only had one job .
but now we have this second one , and it feels like it &apos;s snowballing .
what are you saying ?
i got offered the head chef job at allesandro &apos;s .
what ?
it &apos;s okay , because you don &apos;t really need me .
you &apos;re the cook !
without you , it &apos;s just me driving up to people &apos;s houses ...
... with empty trays , asking for money .
all right . but i &apos;ll pay you back all the money you invested .
and you can keep the van !
for what ?
i can &apos;t believe this !
i got to get out of here .
phoebe , wait a minute .
i &apos;m an assistant buyer !
we &apos;ll get coffee , get energized , then head back out .
yeah , all right .
okay .
so we &apos;re having fun , right ?
we don &apos;t need that wizard guy .
we hit some clubs , talk to some strangers ...
... then go down to the docks and see about that boat thing .
i &apos;m kind of beat .
actually ...
... me too .
are you serious ?
thank god ! i &apos;m exhausted .
you guys want coffees ?
i don &apos;t want to be up too late , so i &apos;ll have a decaf .
yeah , me too .
actually , could i get some hot water with lemon ?
i strained my voice screaming in there . does it have to be so loud ?
i can &apos;t hear a word . my ears are ringing so bad .
i was glad i had that extra pair of socks .
i used them as mittens .
i didn &apos;t want to touch a thing in that last place .
how sad are we ?
yeah , i know .
you know what ? we &apos;re not sad .
we &apos;re just not 21 anymore . you know ?
i &apos;m 29 years old , damn it !
i want to sit in a comfortable chair , watch tv ...
... and go to sleep at a reasonable hour .
i like to hang out in a quiet place where i can talk to my friends .
and so what if i like to go home , put on kenny g and take a bath ?
we &apos;re 29 . we &apos;re not women .
there you are .
i &apos;m glad you decided to hear me out .
okay , i &apos;m hearing .
i &apos;ve been doing a lot of thinking .
i came up with a bunch of businesses that you can do with your van .
you could be a flower delivery person .
what ?
or a bakery delivery person ?
pizza ?
monica ?
i got a whole bunch of stuff in this area .
but i get the feeling you don &apos;t want to deliver .
no .
okay .
i guess if you don &apos;t want to deliver ...
... you probably don &apos;t want to pick up stuff either .
no .
you know what ?
let &apos;s do the catering business .
really ? are you sure ?
yeah , i made a commitment to you .
it &apos;d be fun .
it will be fun !
let &apos;s plan the wedding reception .
you really wanted me to do something with this van .
you know what ? i want you to take the chef job .
really ?
yeah .
that &apos;s what you really want .
i don &apos;t want to be the reason you &apos;re unhappy . i &apos;d be unhappy .
and i really don &apos;t want to be the reason i &apos;m unhappy .
thank you .
besides , it might be kind of fun to form the new a @-@ team .
hi , mrs. lynch .
is joanna in already ?
oh , my goodness ! you haven &apos;t heard .
heard what ? -joanna ...
joanna
... passed away last night .
oh , my god ! how ?
she was leaving work , and she was hit by a cab .
oh , my god ! i cannot believe it !
i know .
oh , god . oh , god .
oh , god .
i didn &apos;t realize that you were so close .
yes . so close !
i know that this is an emotional and difficult time for all of us .
but by any chance ,
did joanna ...
... send any paperwork your way before it happened ?
no , nothing
imagine ,
if she &apos;d just stepped off that curb a few seconds later .
yes , just a few seconds and she &apos;d still be with us .
nothing about an assistant buyer ?
i &apos;m sorry . i have to go .
good morning !
i guess you didn &apos;t hear about joanna .
i sure did !
i &apos;m excited about having monica on board with us .
although i do feel bad about having fired chef emilio .
it is like losing a member of the family .
of course , that literally is the case for several of you .
tony , carlos , marie ...
... please tell your father how much we &apos;re going to miss him .
i know monica has a lot of great ideas for this place .
well , you all read the review .
so without much further ado ...
... i present to you our new head chef .
i just want to say that with a pinch of excitement ...
... a dash of hard work and a dollop of cooperation ...
... we can have the recipe ....
are you going to kill me ?
