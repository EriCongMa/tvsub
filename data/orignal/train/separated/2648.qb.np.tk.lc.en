what really matters is this .
nothing else is guaranteed .
i mean , if they &apos;re trying to prove keen &apos;s innocence ,
why go after some high @-@ priced vigilante ?
why do any of what they &apos;ve done ?
they &apos;re searching .
but if not for keen &apos;s innocence , then what for ?
this is a perilously fast run down a slippery road .
you &apos;d have to hit all green lights , but ...
we could make it work .
西维吉尼亚州郊区
does anything appear out of the ordinary ?
no , but i don &apos;t like this , raymond .
we &apos;re less than an hour behind you ,
and ian will be there any minute to open the store .
the care package will be there soon after .
i should be with you .
you will be in less than an hour .
oh , and don &apos;t forget that other matter we discussed .
other matter ?
ian has a first edition of &quot; life on the mississippi &quot; for me .
multitasking .
have i ever told you the story about ian bartleby and his wife
and the beekeeper they fell into bed with on the isle of skye ?
fascinating , illuminating story .
oh , it &apos;s been a long drive .
any chance i can hear about ian
and the beekeeper after i clean up ?
yes .
freshen up . i &apos;ll fill the tank .
get us something to eat .
lizzy ...
we &apos;re very close .
this &apos;ll all be over soon .
excuse me .
my friend who was just here ,
um , brown coat , hat --
you didn &apos;t happen to see where he went ?
who ?
he was just here .
he got gas at pump 5 .
maybe he paid credit at the pump .
no , he would have paid cash .
no , no cash customers for hours .
okay , listen to me , this is very important .
my friend -- he wouldn &apos;t have just left .
excuse me , uh , ma &apos;am , is there a problem ?
she thinks something might have happened to her friend .
your friend -- can you describe him .
i can ask my manager if you want ,
see if he can roll back the security cameras .
thank you . no . i &apos;m sure he &apos;s here somewhere .
thanks for your concern , officer .
reddington , where are you ?
oh , god .
got it .
第108号
please tell me reddington &apos;s called you .
no . why , is something wrong ?
he was here one minute .
he was getting gas . and now he &apos;s gone .
i @-@ i &apos;ve called and called . h @-@ he hasn &apos;t answered his phone .
elizabeth , where are you ?
you can &apos;t leave the store .
if raymond is in trouble ...
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s an explanation ,
but you cannot leave until you &apos;ve secured the care package .
call me if you hear from reddington .
navabi .
reddington &apos;s missing .
what do you mean , &quot; missing &quot; ?
samar , i need you to promise me something .
if i give you his burner number --
if i ask you to trace his location ,
can you promise me you won &apos;t tell ressler ?
what &apos;s the number ?
240 @-@ 555 @-@ 0146 .
samar , i know what a difficult position i &apos;m putting you in .
i don &apos;t think you do .
but reddington just vanished .
he &apos;s at 2436 bronson , outside davis creek .
it looks like it &apos;s a salvage yard .
a salvage yard .
good luck .
you , uh , think we should go into work separately ?
you don &apos;t think they &apos;d believe we carpooled ?
no .
last night was nice .
yes . it was .
don &apos;t be late .
i hear the boss is a -- he &apos;s a real prick .
reven wright &apos;s waiting for you in mr. cooper &apos;s office .
someone ran a search on this and then cleared the history .
i want a list of every i.p. address
visited in the last 24 hours .
want me to log it into evidence ?
no , no , just the , uh , search history .
you missed a button .
left in a hurry .
cooper sold us out .
you don &apos;t know that .
i heard keen and her ex on the phone set a meeting .
i told one person -- harold cooper .
i show up to arrest them , and they &apos;re gone .
how could cooper possibly warn keen ?
how would he even reach her ?
he didn &apos;t reach her . he reached him .
he &apos;s working with tom .
they &apos;re running some kind of an operation to exonerate keen .
he betrayed us .
where are you on solomon ?
ex @-@ cia disavowed after the eritrean war .
i &apos;ll talk to laurel hitchin about him .
she comes from that world .
in the meantime , find out what the hell
harold cooper is doing with tom keen .
we don &apos;t have to stand here and play &quot; mother , may i ? &quot;
with donald ressler , all right ?
you got a badge .
make the collar and walk him into dcpd .
i spoke to reddington .
he has a plan , but we have to keep karakurt secure
until everything is set .
great , so we do nothing .
i want him out of here now .
soon . i promise .
we got company .
harold , what the hell is going on .
tell me you got guns in this house .
just the one .
get it .
i &apos;m here ! don &apos;t shoot !
everybody out now . go !
what are you working on ?
nothing .
really ?
because it looks like --
actually , can i ask you something ?
agent ressler -- this is his laptop .
he asked me to run a search history .
and why would he do that ?
why wouldn &apos;t he know what was searched on his own computer ?
he just said as soon as i figured it out , let him know .
you can &apos;t do that .
why can &apos;t i do that ?
because i did the search . for liz .
she called and she said reddington was missing ,
and she asked me to trace his burner number .
she made me promise not to tell ressler .
you know where they are , and you &apos;re not gonna tell him .
i only know the truth about my brother
because of reddington .
i owe him for that this once .
why use agent ressler &apos;s laptop ?
when liz called , i wasn &apos;t thinking .
his laptop -- he must have left it at my work station .
i don &apos;t know . it was just there .
aram , please .
i get it .
i totally get it .
whatever you need .
mum &apos;s the word .
thank you .
thanks for the ride .
morning , sunshine .
you one badass too , ain &apos;t you ?
some kind of james bond silencer and everything ?
what you want we should do with him , cash ?
i say we tie him to the truck ,
drag him down the road
till there &apos;s nothing left but bloody wingtips .
i think he &apos;s cute .
don &apos;t touch the merchandise , bitch !
i didn &apos;t mean nothing .
leave her be .
jilly &apos;s just playing .
leme see if i can guess how this works .
you grab hapless motorists , drain their atm accounts ,
max out their credit cards ,
and dump them by the side of the road .
money or your life .
you &apos;re highwaymen .
&quot; k.o.t.h. &quot;
knights ...
kings of the highway .
how romantic .
something like that .
but , uh , whether or not you &apos;re , uh , breathing
when we dump you --
well , that entirely depends on how polite you are .
i like wearing your c @-@ coat .
must have set you b @-@ b @-@ back a bundle .
no doubt worth considerably less now .
i like this one . like his style .
like his gun .
i like his watch . rolex .
that &apos;s $ 10,000 easy .
there &apos;s more than that ,
if we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement .
that right ?
&apos;cause all you got here is about , uh , 700 bucks
and a florida driver &apos;s license .
so tell me , kenneth rathers ,
what &apos;s a cat like you
doing driving an old beater like that , hmm ?
you some kind of eccentric , or are you on the lam ?
yeah , that &apos;s what i am , cash .
i &apos;m on the lam .
i was wondering when we &apos;d get to that .
well , we &apos;re getting to it now .
you got some explaining to do , jack !
so , figure it out ?
i did .
and ... ?
i have a question ...
about , uh , protocols .
when we find agent keen ,
are you positive we &apos;ll be able to protect her ?
aram , what did you find out ?
protocols -- what are they ?
keen will be held here under our supervision .
i will handle her transportation to the federal courthouse
with teams handpicked by me .
no exceptions .
her travel will be overseen by a district court judge
with a component level clearance ,
who has been vetted by hitchin and wright
to make sure that they &apos;re not involved with the , uh , cabal .
okay ?
they &apos;re in west virginia .
the search traced mr. reddington &apos;s burner
to a location outside of ... davis creek .
we need to talk .
so ... you &apos;re protecting them -- keen and reddington ?
samar , i know about the search on my computer .
she called he was missing .
so you knew where they were ,
and you didn &apos;t tell me .
she couldn &apos;t , after mr. reddington helped with her brother .
that &apos;s not why i did it .
it &apos;s not ? you said --
if we bring liz in , she will die .
first cooper tipped them off about wing yee
and now you &apos;re protecting them .
cooper didn &apos;t tip them off . i did .
so i told you where they were , and you warned them ?
yes .
jesus , i told reven wright that cooper betrayed us --
betrayed me .
boy , was i wrong . he didn &apos;t . it was you .
i want you gone by the end of the day .
no atm or c @-@ c @-@ credit cards ?
hey , man , you didn &apos;t complain when we were grabbing him .
that was a solid snatch .
solid snatch , my ass .
this g @-@ g @-@ guy stinks of the m @-@ mob .
well , he smells like money to me .
there &apos;s money in it , all right .
best grab what we &apos;ve had since we rolled into town .
he may not have much on him ,
but somebody will pay his bank to cut him loose .
i say we cut on him till he t @-@ talks .
you idiot .
if somebody &apos;s gonna pay to get him back ,
they ain &apos;t gonna like it too much if he &apos;s all cut up .
sweet thing .
why don &apos;t you give it a go , huh ?
yeah .
maybe he &apos;ll sing like a bird .
that girl is nuttier than a bag of roasted cashews ...
... and twice as tasty .
nice , huh ? just came in this morning .
belongs to a retired doctor and his wife .
they was on their way up to visit their daughter
in baltimore when she broke down .
how &apos;d it get here ?
tow truck .
boy named jasper
runs all the auto club alerts along 119 .
can you tell me where to find him ?
what the hell ?
i &apos;m sorry .
let me get you another one .
uh , two .
what &apos;s her name ?
the one who broke it ?
amber .
amber &apos;s a bitch .
yeah , she was .
i &apos;m jasper .
i &apos;m kenya .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s quite a name .
well , i am quite a girl .
they weren &apos;t coming to save you . they were coming to kill you .
you want to live ? tell me how they found you .
so , where are we going ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m sorry , char . i wish i had a plan .
i don &apos;t .
they said they did it to protect me .
what was ?
a tracking chip .
get on 95 south . head towards roanoke .
what &apos;s in roanoke ?
there &apos;s a cabin -- lake yvonne .
i know where the key is .
they &apos;re on us .
we can &apos;t outrun them .
it &apos;s a radio frequency .
all right , where is it ?
it &apos;s in my chest .
well , that is gonna suck for you .
we need to get him underground , lose the signal .
they &apos;re still here .
down now !
hold on !
oh , god .
go ! go ! go now !
signal cut out here ,
but once we go in , mr. solomon , i can re @-@ acquire it .
looks like we have some rats to catch .
it &apos;s tea time .
that &apos;ll be fun , jilly .
cucumber sandwiches ?
and scones .
how delicious .
would you like one lump or two ?
two , please .
you simply must tell me your name .
it &apos;s dreadfully rude of me not to address you properly .
kenneth .
your real name .
kenneth .
now look what you &apos;ve done . you spilled all the tea , dear .
you have to tell me your real name .
they &apos;re gonna hurt me if you don &apos;t .
you like getting hurt , jilly .
you wouldn &apos;t be here with them if you didn &apos;t .
you think so ?
i do .
maybe you &apos;re right .
what &apos;s this ?
not bad , baby !
there &apos;s over 25 large here !
25 ?
that &apos;s over 6 grand apiece .
nice work , jilly !
hey , what about jasper ?
five ways .
jasper ain &apos;t one of us .
he &apos;s hired help , all right ?
he &apos;ll take what we want to give him .
don &apos;t hold too tight , darlin &apos; .
there .
why don &apos;t you get us another round ?
i &apos;m gonna go tinkle .
这次宰了只肥羊 你在哪里
you couldn &apos;t stay away .
i &apos;m an idiot . i didn &apos;t realize how late it was .
i @-@ i got to go back to work .
i got a better idea .
your place .
keep an eye up .
sit .
what &apos;s that for ?
i &apos;m gonna amputate your leg .
what do you think it &apos;s for ? i &apos;m taking the chip out .
are you crazy ?
we can &apos;t stay down here .
if we go up there , they will find us ,
and they will kill us .
so i &apos;m taking it out .
do we have a signal yet ?
it &apos;s weak , but they &apos;re ahead of us .
what are we doing here , harold ?
let &apos;s forget about where we are
and think about where we &apos;re going .
this cabin -- tell me about it .
it &apos;s not important right now .
i know you &apos;ve been wanting us to go away .
was this supposed to be a surprise ?
char , i promise --
the cabin belongs to doug koster .
what are you doing with a key to our neighbor &apos;s cabin ?
it happened before you got sick .
we were in such a different place .
you were working all the time ,
and i was -- i was lonely .
well , the truth is , like , i mean ,
just thinking about you getting sick ,
it was a blessing
because it made me realize
what a fool i had been and how lucky i am .
so ... find out anything about solomon ?
not yet . i have -- i &apos;ve got a call into laurel .
i &apos;ve got a lead on keen .
agent navabi talked to her . she was ... helping her .
helping , so you could catch her .
no , just helping her . so i fired her .
you fired agent navabi for aiding and abetting ?
are you suggesting i prosecute her ?
that &apos;s your call .
as is whether to prosecute harold cooper .
harold is one of the most decent men i know .
would it violate our principles to be a little flexible ?
well , that &apos;s exactly what tommy markin used to tell my dad .
they were partners -- detroit p.d.
he &apos;d sit around talking about how dirty the precinct was
and how they were gonna clean it up .
did they ?
no .
when my father refused to go on the payroll ,
a drug dealer put a bullet in him .
it was a trap , set by the crookedest cop of all --
good old tommy markin .
what happened to him ?
nothing . they protected him .
my father died for his principles .
if i compromise mine ,
it &apos;ll be as if he died for nothing .
you really think we weren &apos;t g @-@ g @-@ gonna find your money ?
you didn &apos;t find anything .
jilly found it &apos; cause you &apos;re too dense to even look for it .
no wonder cash doesn &apos;t trust you
with anything more important than babysitting .
that &apos;s big talk coming from a g @-@ guy who &apos;s --
you are aware you need to clean and oil these
from time to time , right ?
next one &apos;s going in your head .
didn &apos;t i tell you
that whether or not you &apos;re breathing
when i dump you depends on how ... polite you are ?
i think that should be it . thank you for your time .
agent ressler , i &apos;m vic cothran ,
here to help in any way we can .
according to the owner ,
the female fugitive was definitely here .
here &apos;s the make , model , and license number
of the vehicle that she &apos;s in .
we also need to track down a local tow @-@ truck driver
by the name of , uh , jasper --
skeehan . we &apos;ve had our eye on him .
suspect he &apos;s a member of a gang -- kings of the highway .
where are we on local media ?
the tv , radio , and newspapers have all agreed
to get the photos and descriptions out a.s.a.p.
all right , funnel any credible sightings directly to me .
i g @-@ g @-@ gotta get to the hospital .
suck it up , kid !
hold still . let old pablo here fix you up .
you &apos;re gonna be just fine .
you sure it didn &apos;t hit an organ ?
looks pretty close to a kidney --
shut up !
don &apos;t listen to him . he &apos;s the one that shot you .
he don &apos;t know nothing .
then again , you bleed out ,
one less person who gets a cut of my money .
i said ...
seriously , man , maybe we should let him get to a hospital .
i &apos;m ... freezing !
you &apos;re going into shock . you &apos;ve lost too much blood .
the body &apos;s beginning to shut down .
okay .
okay .
you know the drill .
give him a fake name .
get in , get patched , get out . got me ?
cash . he &apos;s on tv .
authorities are concentrating their search
on kanawha and roane county .
residents of those areas are advised to report
any suspicious activity to local law enforcement .
oh , yeah . we &apos;re looking at a lot more than 25 grand .
... murder and domestic terror charges ...
wow , i love what you &apos;ve done with the place .
yeah , well , you know , i just ...
it &apos;s just temporary .
come here .
you gonna offer me a beer ?
wait right here .
no , go away .
they &apos;re further down .
wait , wait .
they &apos;re behind us moving fast .
how &apos;d that happen ?
i have no idea .
wait , he &apos;s right here .
very good .
when &apos;s the last time you got any of that , pablo ?
or have you ?
we share everything .
but not with jasper , apparently .
that &apos;s our business . it ain &apos;t yours .
oh , it is very much my business .
as a matter of fact , pablo ,
our operations are remarkably similar ,
albeit mine functions on a somewhat grander scale ,
certainly more hygienic .
but at the end of the day ,
it all boils down to the same basic principle .
we steal from others but not from each other .
shut your mouth , or i swear to god , i &apos;m gonna --
kill me ? that &apos;ll fix things .
at least until those two decide
a two @-@ way split makes more sense than four .
tell me something . do you trust cash ?
do you trust him with your life ?
hey , man , this ain &apos;t a good time .
i just texted you a picture , all right ?
that fella we grabbed this morning --
his name is raymond reddington ,
and he is number one on the fbi &apos;s most wanted list .
and that gal he &apos;s with --
she &apos;s that russian chick that blew up them cia guys .
do you think we can still find her ?
they &apos;re worth a fortune .
everything okay ?
yeah . all good .
yeah , i got to call you back .
wha ... ?
where &apos;s my friend ? !
卡车维修
jasper skeehan took a break for lunch and hasn &apos;t returned .
incident report just came in on a walk @-@ in at the e.r.
with a gsw to the abdomen .
says it was a hunting accident ,
but doctors pulled out a .380 slug .
who hunts with a .380 ?
exactly .
i don &apos;t like this .
get the motor home ready .
if t @-@ bone makes it back , he can haul the trailer .
otherwise , screw it . i want to get out of here .
what about reddington ?
hey . you okay ?
i &apos;ll be fine .
anything i can do ?
i &apos;m good .
i never would have said anything if i knew this was gonna happen .
you said you weren &apos;t going to say anything at all .
i know , and i am sorry , but you lied .
you said agent ressler &apos;s laptop was on your work station ,
and we both know that is not the truth .
the i.p. address where your search originated --
it was agent ressler &apos;s apartment early this morning .
way early , so ...
aram , i &apos;m sorry .
yeah .
me too .
sir , you really should let us keep you overnight .
excuse me . donald ressler , fbi .
what seems to be the problem ?
no problem at all , officer .
just trying to be on my way .
so , this was a hunting accident ?
that &apos;s right .
funny outfit for hunting .
probably should get one of those orange v @-@ v @-@ vests , huh ?
well , doctor , if he wants to go ,
there &apos;s nothing we can do to force him to stay .
well , thank you , officer .
i appreciate it .
we &apos;re letting him walk ?
that &apos;s raymond reddington &apos;s coat .
let &apos;s see where he leads us .
what do you think is actually going on here ?
piss off , man .
you sure this is about me ?
i &apos;m worth a lot more to them than you are .
i wouldn &apos;t be at all surprised
if i were to walk out of these woods alive ,
and i sincerely doubt you &apos;ll be as lucky .
where do you suppose we &apos;re gonna go with my money ?
i say aruba .
maybe cancún .
it &apos;s jasper .
where the hell you been ?
you &apos;re holding my friend . i want to make a deal .
it &apos;s that russian bitch .
i &apos;m listening .
i &apos;ve got your friend jasper here .
straight trade -- him for reddington .
and i thought you was gonna offer me
something worth a damn , sister .
keep him .
i don &apos;t think you understand the situation here .
the situation is that my man reddington here
is worth a fortune , and jasper , god bless his heart ,
is , uh -- well , he &apos;s dead weight .
tell him it &apos;s been real .
dude , jasper &apos;s family .
yeah , well , if that &apos;s a fact , uh , he &apos;s the idiot cousin .
forget him .
three of us is family .
that &apos;s what counts .
reddington is worth a fortune ?
what ?
you just said reddington is worth a fortune ?
yeah , and ... ?
you &apos;re not gonna kill him , are you ?
of course we &apos;re gonna kill him .
what do you think we &apos;re doing out here ?
what are you doing , son ?
pablo , what the hell ?
answer the phone .
you tell her we gonna make a trade .
what are you doing ? you &apos;re gonna ruin everything .
see , this is why i don &apos;t go to family reunions .
aunt lucile is always arguing with buddy ,
uncle scott is drunk by noon ,
and someone &apos;s hand is always in the wrong cookie jar .
you ain &apos;t got the stones to pull that trigger .
pick up the phone .
put it on speaker .
listen to me .
we &apos;re ready to deal .
reddington &apos;s worth a bundle . you know it .
you and him are worth two mil to the feds .
you can match that ?
i can .
uh , it &apos;ll take some time .
i &apos;ll call you back in two hours .
elizabeth , don &apos;t !
shut up , man . you don &apos;t get no vote .
two hours ... or reddington here &apos;s dead .
and bring jasper ,
or no deal .
pablo .
that was beautiful .
dembe , i believe this is what you &apos;ve been waiting for .
heavier than it looks .
raymond .
reddington &apos;s been abducted .
i &apos;m not exactly sure by who , and i don &apos;t know why ,
but i think i have a plan to get him back .
a prisoner exchange ?
that and we have to give them the care package .
raymond will not allow that .
i &apos;m not asking his permission .
we need it to clear your name .
if we don &apos;t do this , they &apos;re gonna kill him .
reven .
i wasn &apos;t expecting you .
well , i need a minute . it &apos;s important .
of course . come in .
what do you know about operation backslide ?
uh , it was a cia operation to support somalia
against the islamic courts union .
与索马里过渡政府对立
why do you ask ?
matias solomon ran the operation .
it was the last one he ran before the agency fired him .
you asked me for information about solomon .
i &apos;m sorry . the day just got away from me .
that &apos;s okay . i did some digging on my own .
so , at the time of the operation ,
you were assistant secretary of state for african affairs .
according to the records ,
the operatives were given state department cover .
solomon was listed as an attaché working out of your office .
yeah , well , we gave cover to a lot of operatives , so ...
and maybe some of them know solomon .
if i could get a list ...
was this , uh , agent ressler &apos;s idea or ... ?
no , no , i haven &apos;t told him yet .
i came here as soon as i found out .
i &apos;m so sorry , honey .
i &apos;m gonna miss you .
i really am .
any last words or final prayer -- anything ?
tommy markin .
that is raymond &apos;s jacket .
let &apos;s just hope it &apos;s not his blood .
where is he ?
somewhere . i don &apos;t know .
hand over jasper and the cash , and we &apos;ll release him .
do you think we &apos;re stupid ?
no , i do not .
elizabeth .
are you all right ?
do not do this . do not give it to them .
all right .
i showed you mine . show me yours .
holy hell .
those what i think they are ?
yeah .
and they &apos;re worth far more than the reward the fbi is offering .
all right , let him go .
you can take cash &apos;s truck . he won &apos;t be needing it .
you are in desperate need of some help , jilly .
