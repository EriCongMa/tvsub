you hear that ?
what was it ?
i don &apos;t know .
we should head back . we can play more later .
come on . it &apos;s almost 7 : 30 .
mom &apos;s gonna be upset if we --
one more kickoff ! i &apos;ll return !
dad ?
第一季 第八集
the storm has come .
a wave of death and destruction
aimed at the few who &apos;ve left so little for so many .
it will wash away the greedy ,
and when it does , you can thank general ludd .
hey , what are you still doing here ?
uh , late start . teacher in @-@ service .
i &apos;m supposed to bring doughnuts --
as if mrs. wempon &apos;s ass could use another bear claw .
what &apos;s , uh , going on here ?
hello .
good morning .
i &apos;m working on it .
a cargo plane bound for los angeles --
sources say it exploded
just 90 seconds after takeoff here in washington .
hey , you see this ?
plane crash .
the debris and the eyewitness accounts say it looks like a bomb .
... investigators on the ground
as to the nature of the explosion .
it &apos;s my dad .
eyewitness reports are claiming
that this could be the result of a terr--
hey . is everything okay ?
what , i can &apos;t call my daughter unless there &apos;s something wrong ?
how you feeling ?
oh , you know me . picture of health .
something &apos;s wrong .
this 12 @-@ year @-@ old who claims to be an oncologist
wants to run another series of tests .
you &apos;re in the hospital ? i &apos;m coming .
no , you &apos;re not . i &apos;m fine .
listen , butterball , i @-@ it &apos;s under control .
i got teams of medical people here .
their teams have teams .
i &apos;m fine .
when are these tests happening ?
today . soon as the doc finishes her martini .
no jokes .
if this is serious , i want to be there .
it &apos;s not .
don &apos;t say that
just &apos; cause you don &apos;t want to bother me .
you &apos;re my dad . you &apos;re allowed to bother me .
it &apos;s just a test , lizzy .
okay . leave your phone on and call me as soon as it &apos;s done , okay ?
all right .
dad , i love you .
i love you , too .
pretending doesn &apos;t make it any better .
she deserves to know the truth .
shut up and hand me that snickers bar , would you ?
absolutely not .
i &apos;m not giving you access to the fbi &apos;s vicap system .
then you &apos;ll just have to find another criminal
to talk to elizabeth keen and make fun of agent ressler .
we have an agreement .
yes , the agreement is for me to bring cases to you .
it doesn &apos;t work the other way around .
i &apos;m not your consultant .
i have no interest in cases that i have no interest in .
personally , i think my proposal was incredibly fair .
you have got to give to get , harold .
you &apos;re asking me to go beyond the terms of our agreement .
if you want me to help you with this case , i will ,
but i need something extra to sweeten the deal .
rest assured , granting me access to vicap
will benefit you just as much as it does me .
does this mean you know who took down that cargo plane ?
you &apos;re speaking as if an individual is responsible for this .
it &apos;s far bigger than you might think .
it &apos;s a movement .
do we have a deal ?
reddington believes general ludd is behind the attack .
they take their name from the leader
of a 19th @-@ century group called the luddites ,
a militant wing of a popular struggle
against early industrial capitalism .
1997 . davos , switzerland .
ludd took credit for a car bomb
that hit the economic international summit .
nine people killed , including two european finance ministers .
2005 . ludd released the source code
protecting trade data for international stockholders .
they caused a computer glitch
that cost the market a few hundred million .
that i can appreciate -- trim the fat off the fat cats .
this group is incredibly well @-@ educated .
they &apos;re as disciplined as any terrorist cell .
identifying the members has been impossible .
does reddington tell you he can i.d. one of these guys ?
better .
says he can identify the group &apos;s founder , nathaniel wolff .
says he &apos;s the man ultimately responsible for taking down that plane .
this is the only known image of him that we have .
get out there . find him .
i &apos;ll let the locals know you &apos;re coming .
nobody sleeps until we have him .
it was definitely a bomb , not mechanical .
at the moment , we have two suspects .
the bomb was homemade ,
straight from the oklahoma city playbook .
it was driven onto the tarmac by a cargo operator
and placed onto the plane inside a shipping crate .
we got bomb residue inside to confirm that .
the driver &apos;s name was roger gard . haven &apos;t found him yet .
what about your second suspect ?
my guys just got word last night a fertilizer plant was robbed .
one of the part @-@ time employees
stole chemicals from a company warehouse .
do you have a name ?
plant manager thinks
it was taken by an employee named arthur denning .
here it is . i got it .
arthur denning started at the greenbow fertilizer plant
three months ago .
u.s. attorney subpoenaed everything they have --
personal records , performance reviews ,
and this -- security footage .
he accessed a remote warehouse at 2 : 16 a.m.
there he is .
that &apos;s our guy .
that &apos;s arthur denning ?
i just got a company i.d. on roger gard .
aram , can you pull up that picture ?
okay . what the hell is going on ?
arthur denning and roger gard are the same person .
can you pull up the photo of wolff ?
whoever that guy is , he is not nathaniel wolff .
then who is he ?
who has my itinerary ?
flight 1143 .
i want you all to know what an honor this has been .
hey , i know you don &apos;t wanna call me ,
because you don &apos;t wanna freak me out .
but f.y.i. , not calling me freaks me out ,
so call me .
uh , i -- i just want to know about the tests .
i love you .
we compared the employee files of gard and denning .
they have one thing in common .
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
we got his home address . let &apos;s roll .
we went to the apartment , looking for the real identity
of the man posing as denning and gard .
the one thing we knew going in
was that the man we were looking for was not nathaniel wolff .
we were wrong . reddington was right .
what proof do you have ?
well , the items we found at the apartment
are basically a love letter from wolff to his father .
wolff &apos;s father was a mechanic
who worked his entire life at ptb aviation .
when wolff was 6,
a corporate raider bought the airline
and sold it off piece by piece .
wolff &apos;s father was a union man ,
fought to keep the airline intact .
he lost , started drinking ,
his wife left , took the kids .
six months later , wolff &apos;s father committed suicide .
okay . but , again , that isn &apos;t proof .
no , but we &apos;ve got nathaniel wolff &apos;s fingerprints
all over the place .
two different people , both with the exact same print ?
you can &apos;t change his fingerprints .
he changed his face .
malaysia is the future , mary .
a whole new world is waiting there .
they are starting a production line --
i am not moving to malaysia .
i understand , but with your skills
in a market like kuala lumpur ...
i find it so reassuring -- the movie stars , the pop singers --
they really are just like the rest of us .
mr. reddington , i told you ,
i &apos;m not interested in anything outside fairfax county .
caleb &apos;s in school . he &apos;s 9 .
i &apos;m treasurer of the pta , for god &apos;s sakes .
i can &apos;t just leave .
mary , darling ,
you would thrive in malaysia ,
and caleb would love it .
those thieving little monkeys near batu caves
are absolute rascals .
molly .
what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re a little early . we &apos;re not ready yet .
one of our most trusted couriers . please excuse us .
you have a suburban housewife
printing fake money out of her garage .
mary is an artist . she has a tremendous gift .
i &apos;ve been calling your people all morning .
luli didn &apos;t pick up .
luli didn &apos;t pick up because we are busy .
well , then you should have dug that chip out of your damn neck .
well , you &apos;re here now ,
so what &apos;s on your mind ?
we searched the home address listed for both suspects
and were able to pull some prints .
they belong to nathaniel wolff .
i never tire of being correct .
someone changed his face .
i understand your father is not well .
excuse me ?
the cancer . it &apos;s come back ?
my father &apos;s fine . he &apos;s just ...
who the hell told you that ?
you should be there ... with him .
i am not doing this -- playing this game ,
guessing what you know
or how you know it .
dr. maltz .
what ?
abraham maltz .
the best surgeon for this sort of business .
maltz .
before we do this , let me be clear --
i have business that requires further travel today ,
so this needs to happen quickly .
you need to follow my lead .
dr. maltz is not on the blacklist .
he &apos;s an asset i need to protect .
you want me to protect some plastic surgeon
who might be linked to a terrorist organization ?
yes .
abraham .
raymond . what brings you in ?
i don &apos;t know how you do it .
i had that done once . i couldn &apos;t bear the tickling .
how are you ?
we need to talk , in private .
yeah , sure . give us a minute , please ?
ray , look at you . you look great .
i mean , the elasticity is amazing .
you been juicing ?
beets , mostly .
some celery , carrots , a lot of ginger .
the kale makes me dyspeptic .
and what &apos;s a beautiful young woman
like you doing with this vulture ?
trust me , it &apos;s not by choice .
so , nathaniel wolff --
you gave him a new face . i need to find him .
you know i would help you if i could , raymond .
i do , and i thank you for that , abraham .
normally , i wouldn &apos;t impose ,
but this is a personal matter of some urgency .
you know my business . you know the rules .
it &apos;s all about confidentiality .
absolutely . this conversation should never leave this office .
i just got done with six hours of surgery ,
and you walk in --
i mean , i don &apos;t know you or why you think
you can come in here and ask questions about my clients .
red , help me out .
my name is special agent elizabeth keen .
i &apos;m with the fbi .
mr. reddington is working with us ,
helping us to capture high @-@ value targets ,
and nathaniel wolff is one of them .
i need to find wolff , and i know you can help us .
wait a minute . you &apos;re an informant now ?
how dare you come in this ...
did you hear me ?
i said i need his new name .
give it to me ,
or i &apos;ll have the miami field office
tear your practice apart faster than you can say &quot; tummy tuck . &quot;
bradley holland .
okay ? that &apos;s the name he goes under now
bradley holland .
abraham !
i refer important clients to you ,
people who are vital to my business ,
people whose livelihood depends on your confidentiality ,
and you roll over like a cockapoo wanting his belly scratched ?
you said this guy was solid .
what ? wait a minute .
some woman who claims to be an fbi agent
makes a few ham @-@ fisted threats ,
and you hand over one of your own clients ?
that &apos;s dirty pool .
god forbid this little incident ever
gets back to poor nathaniel wolff .
red , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on here .
what other secrets have you just given away ?
nothing !
who knows about the work i &apos;ve had done ?
nobody , truthfully ! you know me !
i brought christina to you
specifically for your discretion and expertise .
i assured her you were trustworthy .
i &apos;m sorry . i was wrong .
shame on you , abraham .
i know another doctor . let &apos;s go .
no , red . we -- we could make this right .
you know me . i would never give out a name of any client !
we believe wolff is now
using the name bradley holland ,
a pilot for innova air .
i &apos;d buy him as a cargo operator ,
but a pilot ?
that would require licenses , documentation ,
a background check .
anonymity is a cornerstone
of this group &apos;s decentralized command structure .
wolff has given up his identity for this cause .
wall street destroyed the airline
that wolff &apos;s father devoted his life to .
so wolff is now using the airlines
in his efforts to destroy wall street .
bradley holland just swiped through security
at reagan national .
get the tsa on the line .
tell them to pull the surveillance feeds
and backtrack the swipe point .
he &apos;s gonna bring down another plane .
sophie .
uh , if it &apos;s okay with you ,
i &apos;m deadheading to denver .
of course . let me check what seats are available .
appreciate that .
i &apos;m bradley .
there &apos;s an empty seat in first .
must be my lucky day .
yes . sir , the attack is imminent .
we need to contact homeland
and have them move the threat level to code red .
all planes in the air need to be rerouted .
nothing should be taking off or landing at reagan .
how about that ?
nuts , right ?
they &apos;re saying a father and son were killed on the ground .
that &apos;s terrible .
that group , the ones that took credit ...
oh , yeah . uh , general ... something .
general -- general ludd .
within an hour of that plane dropping out of the sky ,
that company lost 30 % of its market share .
bunch of wackos , right ?
oh , you said it .
out @-@ of @-@ work , sexually frustrated ,
living @-@ at @-@ home losers ,
if you ask me .
what line of work are you in ?
hedge funds . dolus capital .
so , uh , this general ludd group ,
you &apos;re like the poster child for everything they hate .
how &apos;s that feel ? you worried ?
not in the gold club , i &apos;m not .
know what i &apos;m saying ?
sophie , do me a favor ?
whatever you need .
i left my log book six gates away .
would you , uh , watch my stuff ?
i &apos;ll put it in first @-@ class overhead .
we &apos;re boarding any minute .
you &apos;re the best .
tom .
liz , aunt june called .
i &apos;m sorry . now &apos;s not a good time .
she said your dad hasn &apos;t exactly been telling you the truth .
apparently , he &apos;s a little sicker than he &apos;s been letting on .
aunt june gets indigestion and thinks she &apos;s having a stroke .
the cancer &apos;s spread to his liver .
what ?
no , he was just going in for a few tests .
apparently , it &apos;s a little more serious than that ,
and aunt june thinks that we need to be there , like , now .
i can &apos;t . i ...
oh , my god . i got to call him .
no , he &apos;s in surgery .
listen , i &apos;m on the next flight out of dulles ,
and i got ellie to watch hudson , so --
surgery for what ?
have you talked to his oncologist ?
no , i talked to june , and you &apos;re right .
she &apos;s probably overreacting .
but if you can &apos;t go now , then , uh ...
yeah , what do you got ?
... then let me book you the 6 : 15 tomorrow morning ,
and you &apos;ll be in nebraska by noon .
okay ?
lizzy , okay ?
okay .
you all right ?
we got him .
deadheading to denver , flight 1143 .
lock off this runway ! clear that terminal !
i want everyone out of here now !
we need emergency vehicles on standby .
bomb squad &apos;s en route .
i want every bag --
hello , sam .
it &apos;s been far too long .
sir ?
i have a family emergency . my father &apos;s sick .
i need to catch a flight .
not an option .
i know the timing is terrible --
all flights are grounded .
what ? why ?
general ludd . fbi headquarters received a manifesto .
we are general ludd .
our uprising against the undue influence
of corporations on our government has begun .
today marks the beginning of a war .
our enemy ? the oligarchs of corporate america ,
则非暴力反抗成为义务
who have destroyed the middle class
on whose backs this country was built .
占领华尔街
our fight is for the soul of this country .
there will be protests , violent uprisings ,
planes will fall from the skies .
the corrupt corporate giants will be brought to their knees .
so , as it begins , ask yourself --
are you general ludd ?
the f.a.a. has implemented 9 / 11 protocol .
all planes are grounded until further notice .
this was the plan all along .
they wanted us to ground those planes -- cripple the economy .
i &apos;ve got an address on bradley holland .
let me guess -- same as denning and gard ?
yes , but i &apos;ve also traced a credit @-@ card payment
in holland &apos;s name to a storage facility --
brooklyn , st. marks ave .
let &apos;s roll .
oh , my god .
i &apos;ve never been more scared of a woman in my life .
she was thrilling in bed . what a pair of legs .
i think she played field hockey in college .
i &apos;ve missed that laugh .
you look like hell .
i finally had a chance to see her , sam .
there &apos;s a fire inside she got from you .
she &apos;s volatile ...
unpredictable ...
soft then hard then ...
soft again .
stronger than she knows .
you gave her an incredible gift , sam .
taking her in and ...
loving her as your own .
they &apos;ve given me six weeks .
for what ?
so i can lay here and watch them take me apart ?
i wish they &apos;d said six hours .
and i told them , i said ,
&quot; you can get rid of those damn machines .
go monitor somebody who &apos;s actually got vital signs . &quot;
i need to tell lizzy .
no .
i know what we agreed ,
but before i go , i have to tell her .
i can &apos;t let you do that .
she deserves the truth .
he created entire lives .
as if they were real people .
who the hell is john horlbeck ?
his whole plan rested on becoming john horlbeck ,
a 45 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver .
the trucking company he works for
has contracts with the bureau of engraving and printing .
every day , b.e.p. moves billions of dollars in currency from
the u.s. mint and federal reserve banks all over the country .
they move it by plane .
but with the planes grounded , they move ...
by truck . today .
this was all an elaborate heist .
how much is horlbeck moving by his trucking company ?
$ 500 million .
okay , just got the transponder frequency
from american secure transport .
target vehicle is crossing over the queensboro bridge ,
delaware plates .
6 @-@ alpha @-@ 7 @-@ 7 @-@ bravo .
daddy , thank god . i was so worried .
what &apos;s going on ? tom just spoke with aunt june .
aunt june talks too much .
tom said you &apos;re in surgery ?
look ...
i &apos;m sorry to bring you so late to the party ,
but ... about three months ago , i wasn &apos;t feeling so great .
so i went to the doc , and , uh ...
she said the cancer came back ... and spread everywhere .
they &apos;re doing what they can ,
but , you know , it ain &apos;t good .
but obviously they think they can do something .
they think --
i should &apos;ve told you the truth .
i should &apos;ve been honest with you from the get @-@ go .
but i couldn &apos;t . i was trying to protect you .
i &apos;m on my way , as soon as i can get on a plane .
you &apos;re gonna be fine , daddy . i know that .
of course i am .
i love you .
i love you , too , butterball .
thank you .
you will always be her father , sam .
i can only hope to ...
... love her and protect her ...
as you have .
excuse me .
i &apos;m here to see sam milhoan . do you know what room he &apos;s in ?
are you family ?
yeah , i &apos;m his , uh , son @-@ in @-@ law -- tom keen .
i ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
we ...
th @-@ thank you .
okay , turning south .
take the midtown tunnel . you can get ahead of him .
keen .
lizzy , how are you ?
not a good time .
sorry . i was just thinking about you
and wanted to see if you needed anything .
with the case ?
no .
with your father .
are you gonna make it home to nebraska ?
all planes are grounded .
not mine .
lizzy , are you sure ...
there &apos;s nothing i can do for you ?
i can &apos;t talk right now .
mind if i sit ?
no , go right ahead .
visiting someone ?
a friend .
he died today .
yourself ?
i , uh , came here to see my father @-@ in @-@ law .
but i ...
i @-@ i didn &apos;t get here in time .
oh , my .
i &apos;m terribly sorry .
it &apos;s hard to ...
not say goodbye .
i have lost so many people .
never seems to get any easier .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna say ...
to my wife .
i &apos;ve been sitting here for i don &apos;t know how long
trying to figure out how to tell her .
my wife and her dad , they had something ...
he took her in when she was 4 years old , adopted her ,
and raised her as a single parent .
she &apos;s gonna be heartbroken .
yes .
it &apos;ll undoubtedly take some time .
but i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll be fine .
he &apos;ll always be there with her ,
standing in the shadows to keep her safe ...
laughing with her in the light ...
watching through her eyes all those who get close .
he &apos;ll always be there .
she will be fine .
i hope you &apos;re right .
i know i am .
we got him .
this was never about the money .
wolff &apos;s people hit that truck
for something far more valuable than the cash .
there was a safe on the truck .
in it was a hard drive containing software upgrades
for the new hundred @-@ dollar bill --
proprietary algorithms , plate design ,
watermarks , encoding techniques .
every last hair on ben franklin &apos;s
eyelash is on that drive .
luckily , we got to him before he could access the safe .
any indication where wolff may be ?
we put out an apb .
all major roads , trains ,
buses , and ports have been secured .
with planes still grounded , flying out isn &apos;t an option .
that &apos;s not exactly true .
lizzy .
you said you could still fly ?
if you know what corners to cut ,
yes , everything is possible .
wolff wanted us to ground those planes
so he could steal the blueprints for the new hundred @-@ dollar bill .
he &apos;s escaping by plane .
nobody &apos;s watching the sky .
my guess is you &apos;re half right .
so if you were him , where would you fly from ?
where was wolff last seen ?
wall street .
how fitting .
let me look into the matter . i &apos;ll see what i can find .
dembe , tell edward we &apos;re making an unscheduled stop .
ready to go ?
oh , i &apos;m not your pilot . he went for a stroll .
well , get him back .
years ago , i used to smuggle small shipments
of oaxaca @-@ highland gold into this airstrip .
beautiful space . bumpy as hell .
you know , mr. wolff , i admire your commitment .
others may doubt you ,
may think your revolutionary talk is just that --
talk to cover your grief -- but i think not .
you really do want
this country &apos;s financial system to fail .
and if i &apos;m not mistaken ,
you &apos;ve come up with an ingenious way to make that happen .
who are you ?
no doubt , the feds
are congratulating themselves this very minute
for recovering the blueprint they assume is real ,
but you and i know it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s a fake .
how you know that ?
you swapped the drives , gave the feds a counterfeit .
if the mint uses it ,
billions of dollars of counterfeit currency
will be circulated , bankrupting this country .
and you &apos;re gonna , what -- stop me ? turn me in ?
i &apos;m gonna rob you .
because unlike you , i happen to believe in capitalism .
i like money . i like the lifestyle it affords me .
i like the things that happen when you give it away .
what becomes of you and general ludd
once you board that plane is none of my concern --
though it is worth noting that a true luddite
would burn the plane rather than fly in it .
but whatever . your irony .
at any rate , have a safe flight .
and buckle up .
this runway is a bitch .
you got the tail number ?
yes , sir .
send it to agent keen .
nathaniel wolff , you &apos;re under arrest .
i &apos;ll call this in to cooper , get the flight ban lifted .
i &apos;ll look after this .
why don &apos;t you go see your father ?
thank you .
is it really worth it , this job ?
risking your life for what --
the privilege of living in some crappy studio apartment ?
they own you .
you get one bite of the apple .
i should &apos;ve known when you agreed to help us catch wolff
that you would take something for yourself .
we didn &apos;t think he could
access the safe on the truck , but he did .
and he swapped the original drive for a counterfeit ,
and when we arrested him , he didn &apos;t have it .
i &apos;m sorry about your father .
how was the funeral ?
this is going to be a difficult time .
the best way to keep the memory of your father alive
is to talk about him .
tell me some stories .
