halloween in the &apos; 80s --
the one day a year you could wear what you want ,
go where you want , eat what you want ,
and nothing could stop me in my voltron costume .
except my &quot; smother . &quot;
oh ! come on . that &apos;s my halloween candy .
let me just eat it already .
not until we take it to the hospital
and have it x @-@ rayed .
ellen shorstein &apos;s son found a handful of aquarium gravel
in an almond cluster .
tore his braces right off .
that was one of the many urban legends back then .
there was no google or wikipedia ,
so you believed every stupid rumor you heard ,
like bigfoot lived in upstate new york
or mr. rogers was the world &apos;s most deadly sniper
or there was a ghost in &quot; three men and a baby . &quot;
we actually believed if you played
led zeppelin , beatles , or the stones backwards ,
you could hear hidden satanic messages .
did you hear that ? he said he loves satan !
you know what i love ? silence !
stop screwing with my record player !
but the most epic urban legend of them all
was that cola became a lethal poison
when mixed with a particular exploding candy .
stupid barry ! why ? !
oh , my god .
you were seconds from death , and i saved you !
what are you talking about ?
hello !
when the bubbles in the soda
mix with the explosives in the pop rocks ,
it triggers a chain reaction that melts your insides !
shut up . it does not .
well , tell that to mikey .
who &apos;s mikey ?
who &apos;s mikey ?
god , you know nothing .
mikey , the spokesboy for life cereal .
you know , he likes it . mikey likes it .
well , he did until he mixed pop rocks and soda ,
then he exploded .
oh , please . he did not .
wait !
i just saved your life .
what ?
according to the way of the samurai ,
you &apos;re my servant until the debt is repaid .
that &apos;s not a thing .
oh , it is . it &apos;s the bushido code .
well , that sounds like complete bull @-@ shido .
it &apos;s ancient history written in stone !
you have no choice !
i &apos;m not anyone &apos;s slave . you didn &apos;t save my life .
and it &apos;s not real .
all right , then .
if you &apos;re so certain it &apos;s not real , then do it .
do it !
aah ! what the hell ? !
what are you , nuts ?
mikey gave his life so that that would never happen again !
it was october 31 , 1980 @-@ something ,
the year my grandfather , a.k.a. burt reynolds ,
threw the most epic halloween bash
his condo building had ever seen .
all right , let &apos;s get this party started !
who wants flaming pumpkin shots ?
ah ! trick or treat , baby .
sure , pops almost burned the place down ,
but he only cared about one thing .
fun party .
okay .
i smoothed everything over .
so i can stay ?
oh , god , no . your landlord &apos;s kicking you out .
but you &apos;re not going to jail .
don &apos;t worry . you can move in with us .
roomies ! we can finally be roomies !
kiddo , i don &apos;t want to cramp your style .
what if you bring a girl back to the room ?
we both know that &apos;s not gonna happen .
let &apos;s go get a bag packed .
finally !
all my boys under one roof ! it &apos;s happening !
no . i know that look in your eye .
you want your dad to live with us forever .
murray , that &apos;s a great idea !
stop making me feel good ! he &apos;s not staying !
bevy , it &apos;s time we discussed other options .
stop it right there .
i have said this a thousand times .
we &apos;re not moving my dad into a home .
shady willows is not a home .
it &apos;s a leisure community for active seniors .
i don &apos;t trust shady willows . &quot; shady &quot; is in the name .
that &apos;s because old people love shade .
they have trees . they have umbrellas .
you name it , they got it .
taco tuesdays , fajita fridays !
it &apos;s all there !
that is way too much mexican food for him .
you &apos;re not to mention this to him . do you understand ?
family takes care of family . end of story .
damn it ! i &apos;m working my ass off
trying to get people to move out of our house .
stop trying to move people in !
let &apos;s compromise , okay ?
until we figure something out , dad can crash in the attic .
ha ha ! good luck getting him to move up there .
it &apos;s hot , it &apos;s dusty , and it &apos;s covered with bat doody .
son of a bitch .
you got that right .
how &apos;d you pull this off in two days ?
oh , it was nothing .
i just dusted , moved some boxes , drywalled ,
did a little electrical work , added a bay window .
u know , mother &apos;s touch .
as my mom was busy moving in pops ,
barry was moving in on lainey in the hopes to get busy .
88 , 89 , 100 .
man , exercise does this body good .
time for a cool @-@ down .
what are you drinking ?
pepto .
set the abba @-@ zaba record at lunch today .
my boys bet me 10 bucks i couldn &apos;t eat 8 .
took down 12 .
are you trying to impress me by eating halloween candy ?
not trying . if it happens , so be it .
goodbye .
later , lainey !
wow . you are the worst .
that &apos;s not what lainey thinks .
she kissed me , remember ?
and now there &apos;s so much electricity between us ,
all hot and crackling .
kind of like pop rocks .
speaking of which ,
remember how i saved your life ?
no .
according to the bushido code , you must repay me .
last night , i figured out what i want .
get me the girl .
no !
just one date !
talk to her ! bushido code !
talking won &apos;t help .
lainey doesn &apos;t like anything about you .
bushido code ! you must do this !
oh , my god .
if i do this , will you stop saying &quot; bushido code &quot; ?
according to bushido code , yes .
fine . i &apos;ll tell her to go have some pizza with you .
yes ! first step , pizza .
second step , we express our love physically .
third step .
that is not the way of the samurai !
as barry was laying down the laws of the bushido code ,
my dad was laying down some laws of his own .
okay , now that she &apos;s moved in your giant speakers
and your king @-@ size waterbed ,
it &apos;s time to go over the rules of the house .
these are more like suggestions , nothing hard and fast .
rule number 1 -- do not touch the thermostat .
touch it ?
you &apos;ve already taped it off like a crazy person .
rule number 2 -- what &apos;s ours is yours .
rule number 3 -- ignore rule number 2 .
what &apos;s mine is mine .
rule 4 -- no coming in after 10 : 00 .
10 : 00 in the morning or 10 : 00 in the evening ?
why would anyone come in at 10 : 00 in the morning ?
why would anyone come in at 10 : 00 in the evening ?
rule number 5 --
mandatory hugs every time you walk through the door .
rule 6 -- no loud music , no parties .
are these written down somewhere ?
i @-@ i &apos;m kind of losing track .
okay , rule 6.1 / 2 -- we love you .
that &apos;s not even a rule !
everyone , just relax .
you &apos;ve opened your home to me ,
and i &apos;m gonna respect your wishes .
you see , honey ? this is gonna be great .
and with that ,
we had a new family member under our roof .
fortunately , this one was a responsible adult
who would never disobey my dad &apos;s insane rules .
or not .
max ! it &apos;s on max !
he touched it !
he touched the thermostat !
god only knows how much money we burned in cold air !
i &apos;ll bake him some cookies and talk to him about it .
no cookies ! do you hear that loud music ?
he &apos;s breaking all of my rules !
here . this will take the edge off .
why are you bringing me a delicious martini right now ?
pops is schooling me in the art of mixology
so i can bartend his parties .
unacceptable ! all of this is unacceptable !
get rid of this .
he &apos;s just testing our boundaries .
if we push him too hard , he &apos;ll rebel more .
you &apos;re talking about him like he &apos;s one of our dumb kids ,
but he &apos;s not !
he &apos;s worse ! i can &apos;t ground him !
my dad had reached his boiling point .
unfortunately , he didn &apos;t know pops was on a hot date .
albert ! turn it off !
oh , my god !
this is not my fault .
i had a necktie hanging on the door .
when a necktie &apos;s on the door , the pants are on the floor .
everyone knows that .
i can &apos;t unsee what i just saw .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
it was like a couple of hairless cats
fighting in a pile of pizza dough .
it was a very bad low angle .
that &apos;s it , bevy . he &apos;s going to shady willows .
wait . shady willows is on the table ?
bup , bup , bup , bup , bup , bup , bup .
murray , we agreed not to mention that place .
why not ? i love it there .
no ! family takes care of family ,
and i am not gonna let a few tiny mishaps change that .
it appears i have popped another waterbed
while entertaining a female friend .
you should go .
i should go .
all right . that &apos;s the last of it .
let &apos;s get you to shady willows .
and step on it so i don &apos;t miss salsa class .
that place is crawling with hot widows .
no !
he &apos;s not leaving ! you &apos;ll have to run me over !
just nudge her a bit . she &apos;ll move .
i &apos;m not gonna hit her with the car , al .
not hit . nudge .
shame on you .
family takes care of family .
you keep saying that , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
we &apos;re taking your dad to a place he wants to be .
and then what ?
we teach our kids it &apos;s okay to abandon us ,
to just pack up our bags and throw us out on an ice floe
and let us drift off into nothingness ?
this sounds like you &apos;re more concerned
with what this means for you .
no , this has nothing to do with my greatest fear
of being alone when i &apos;m old .
this is about family .
oh ! so that &apos;s why you &apos;re against this .
you &apos;re afraid that our stupid children
will put you into a home .
don &apos;t spin this around on me .
this is about my father , about my mantra --
family takes care of beverly .
i mean family . you know what ?
that was a bad slip , and i admit that .
put your seat belt on . i &apos;m gonna nudge her .
good for you .
don &apos;t you nudge me .
oh , i &apos;m nudging you !
don &apos;t you nudge me !
you &apos;ve been nudged !
this isn &apos;t over , not by a long shot , mister !
i will ...
so !
saw you talking to lainey this morning .
we all set ?
what are you wearing ?
it &apos;s my fanciest flavor flav clock .
or should i go digital ? show her i &apos;m a modern man .
put your clock back on your nightstand .
i talked to lainey about this weekend .
it &apos;s a no @-@ go .
oh , it &apos;s a scheduling issue ?
tell her i &apos;m available monday through friday
and every other weekend ever plus all other weekdays .
yeah , no , that &apos;s not the issue .
she thinks you &apos;re --
how do i put this gently ? -- gross .
what ? !
did you tell her i can bench 200 ?
yep .
did you tell her i can pop like three wheelies in a row ?
i did .
did you tell her i &apos;m a self @-@ taught dancer ?
she was not impressed .
did you tell her that i give no excuses
and take no prisoners ?
no dice .
did you tell her i &apos;m silky smooth but cut from steel ?
totally .
did you tell her i can kick as high as my head
and i used to own a python ?
i told her everything . no go .
i thought ... i actually had a shot .
you don &apos;t .
i &apos;m never gonna find a girl .
seriously , i &apos;m gonna be alone forever .
it &apos;s not fair !
stop being so dramatic .
bushido code .
i &apos;ve been rejected and shamed .
let these pop rocks and soda be the sword
that brings me an honorable samurai death .
i talked to the science teacher . it &apos;s not real .
well , tell that to the chemical reaction happening in my mouth right now .
this is science .
while barry had given up on his future ,
my mom was trying to secure hers .
hey , snuggle bear .
came to cheer you up . i know how upset you must be .
about what ?
well , i don &apos;t want you to think
in this family we abandon our parents .
pops should be living here ,
just like how i &apos;m gonna be living with you .
wait . what ?
since when are you living with me ?
what about erica ?
lovely girl , but deal with those mood swings ?
no , thank you .
well , then go live with barry .
oh , sweetie , it &apos;s more than likely we &apos;ll be taking care of him .
what ? so now i &apos;m taking care of you and barry ?
just me . we &apos;ll find a place for barry .
maybe the merchant marine or a commune .
why does barry get to live on a commune while i &apos;m stuck with you ?
hon , not just me .
you &apos;ll have your lovely wife
and four beautiful boys for support .
no way . i won &apos;t have room for you , too .
well , we &apos;ll convert the garage
into a cozy , little in @-@ law suite .
the garage is my space !
that &apos;s where i watch movies
and display my collectible figurines .
oh , you can move all that down to the basement .
so now i &apos;m getting banished down to the basement ?
i work my ass off , and this is all i get ?
fine . take the garage .
i &apos;ll just live down in the basement like a mole person .
is that what you want ?
why can &apos;t you just stay in a hotel and visit every once in a while ?
a hotel ?
where the maid can steal my jewelry
and someone can break in and clonk me on the head ?
fine ! don &apos;t visit , then !
oh , i know where this is coming from .
your wife .
you said she was lovely !
when it &apos;s convenient for her .
why are we even talking about this ? !
i &apos;m just a little boy !
where are you going , young man ?
to stay with pops ! you &apos;re crazy .
while i headed down to shady willows ,
my mom headed up to my treehouse
to contemplate her future .
what are you doing up here ?
i needed to eat my feelings ,
and this is where adam hid his halloween candy from you .
anything good left ?
just these awful circus peanuts .
yeah , nobody wants those .
just like me .
i &apos;m the circus peanut of mothers .
what are you talking about ?
adam won &apos;t let me live with him when i &apos;m old .
god knows erica won &apos;t take me in .
so looks like this is where i &apos;m gonna spend my golden years ,
right up here in this treehouse .
well , what about barry ?
oh , well , you &apos;ve solved that problem .
please reserve me the master suite
in his rap mansion in the clouds .
trust me , bevy . our kids will never abandon you .
how do you know ?
look at how well you treat your own dad .
you think they don &apos;t notice that ?
well , i guess i am pretty blatant with my love .
of course you are .
and it &apos;s like you always say . family takes care of family .
and speaking of which ,
i could use some help getting down from here .
no .
my mom may have been kidding ,
but barry &apos;s love for lainey was no joke .
lainey !
okay .
before you say anything , just hear me out .
i know erica gave you the big sell on me ,
but i can &apos;t just give up on us without a fight .
what &apos;s happening ?
i &apos;m @-@ a tell you what &apos;s happening .
jtp , drop the beat .
i &apos;d do anything for a girl named lainey
i &apos;ll punch a tiger , swim the allegheny
i know it &apos;s creepy &apos; cause i &apos;m her best friend &apos;s brother
but i love her , and we should be together
like joanie loves chachi , tango loves cash
she the turner to my hooch
i &apos;ll be the bangers in your mash
oh , my god ! stop !
don &apos;t stop !
&quot; l &quot; to the &quot; y &quot; to the &quot; n &quot; to the &quot; e &quot; ?
that spells lainey , that &apos;s a rap from big taste @-@ y
first of all , you spelled my name horribly wrong .
and secondly , erica never talked to me about you .
what ? ! but ...
she said that ...
erica swore to me !
we had an agreement !
she talked me up , but you said no .
yeah , that didn &apos;t happen .
in that moment ,
barry knew the next thing he said had to be perfect .
lies .
you have no honor whatsoever !
i &apos;m okay with that .
don &apos;t you walk away from me .
i saved your life .
and this is how you repay me ?
you should be thanking me .
i was just trying to spare your feelings .
i didn &apos;t expect you to do some love rap to lainey
about turner and hooch .
they weren &apos;t even a couple , dude .
one is a dog .
that dog took a bullet for tom hanks !
that &apos;s love !
aah ! i &apos;m in so much pain !
yeah , yeah . your heart is broken .
just stop with the dramatics .
no !
there &apos;s something wrong with my insides ! aah !
oh , no . oh , god , it &apos;s happening !
pop rocks and cola ! i &apos;m mikey !
it &apos;s not real !
oh , this is real .
it just took longer to take me down
&apos;cause my body &apos;s in peak condition .
oh , yeah .
you did this to me .
this is on you !
barry .
get up !
barry ?
as barry was rushed over to the e.r. ,
my mom rushed to fetch me
from pops &apos; new luxurious retirement community .
hi , daddy . can i come in ?
there &apos;s no tie on the door . you &apos;re good to go .
wow . you did all this ?
hey , you get it from somewhere .
are you sure you &apos;ll be okay here ?
bev , this is where i belong .
good food , good people .
and you wouldn &apos;t believe how far a full head of hair
will get you in here with the ladies .
well , i &apos;m happy for you .
and , uh , thanks for looking after adam .
a little time away was the best thing for him .
ahh ! just took a good schvitz . oh , and i ran into irma .
she invited us over to play some gin rummy .
uh , sweetie , i think it &apos;s time to come home .
no . i &apos;m never coming home .
this place has a sauna , an early @-@ bird dinner at 4 : 30,
and a seat in every shower .
all my life , i have been washing my body
standing up like a yutz .
he &apos;s only been here for two hours .
well , the kid knows a good thing when he sees it .
wow . an obstructed bowel .
didn &apos;t see that coming .
who knew eating 12 full @-@ sized taffy bars
and drinking all that pink goop would block me up .
most people .
so , after all of that , you saved my life for real .
i did , didn &apos;t i ?
stupid bushido code .
now i &apos;m forever in your debt .
actually , i thought today i &apos;d be the one to do you a favor .
in the end , for erica ,
it wasn &apos;t about the bushido code .
it was about being a good big sister .
i &apos;ve got to make a phone call .
so , how &apos;s your butt ?
horrible .
but it &apos;s not even the worst part of my week .
yeah . about that love rap --
let &apos;s just forget it ever happened .
know what ? no .
i said it , and i stand by it .
oh . well , your persistence is misguided and annoying ,
but kind of cute .
so , i heard this place has really good pizza .
you want to grab a slice ?
i can &apos;t eat for another 24 hours ...
but i can sit with you .
hey . kind of early for bedtime .
well , eating dinner at 4 : 30 kind of threw me off .
oh . um , you want some tucks ?
i &apos;m too old for tucks .
listen .
i &apos;m sorry i freaked you out .
it &apos;s not your job to take care of me .
it &apos;s my job to take care of you .
but what &apos;s gonna happen when i grow up ?
well , we have a long time to figure that out , shmoopie .
a long time .
sure you don &apos;t want a tuck ?
maybe a little one .
hey , mom ?
i &apos;m sure when the time comes ,
i &apos;ll find some space for you in my house .
really ?
yeah . i &apos;ll always make room for you .
sure , we had our differences , but my mom was right .
family takes care of family , and that &apos;s no urban legend .
got to admit ,
this is my first date in a hospital .
wait . this is a date ?
well , pity date .
i &apos;ll take it .
and without family , barry &apos;s worst day
wouldn &apos;t have become his best day .
there you are !
and then his worst day .
my delicious little baby ,
i am so sorry i wasn &apos;t home when they called .
mom , please !
your poor , clogged bottom .
nurse ! nurse !
现在她依然想搬去和我一起住
say something for the camera .
i love him . i love him .
don &apos;t worry . mama &apos;s got this .
arms up . arms up .
dude ! you just , like , saved my life !
thank you .
you don &apos;t have to thank me . it &apos;s my job .
but according to bushido code , you will have to repay me .
you know about bushido code ?
oh , i watched &quot; shogun . &quot;
that richard chamberlain , meow .
fine . what do you want ?
i want snuggies .
aw , come on !
i want huggies and cuddlies and smoochies .
no !
i want them .
no !
i want them .
i choose a warrior &apos;s death instead !
put the taco back in my mouth !
bushido code ! you have no honor !
