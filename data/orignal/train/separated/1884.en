A month ago, you were in med school being taught by doctors.
Today...
you are the doctors.
The seven years you spend here as a surgical resident,
will be the best and worst of your life.
You will be pushed to the breaking point.
Eight of you will switch to an easier specialty.
Five of you will crack under the pressure.
Two of you will be asked to leave.
This is your starting line.
This is your arena.
How well you play,
that's up to you.
Mer?
Meredith! Meredith!
Get up! You have to get up now!
Meredith! Get up!
Oh, God.
How long was I out?
I don't--I...
I don't know. I lost my--
I lost my shoe.
Where's-- where's Derek and Lexie?
I don't... I don't know. I lost a shoe.
What happened?
The plane crashed, that's what happened.
We were in a plane, and it crashed. Plane crash.
Where is Derek?!
Cristina, where is Derek?
He was sucked out the side
when we hit the trees,
and then the back of the plane came off.
It came--it came off.
Lexie was in the back of the plane.
I-I looked to the back, and all I could see was freakin' sky.
Where is she?
I don't know! I only have one shoe!
I'm bleeding.
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!
Do you hear-- do you hear that sound?
Where is that sound coming from?
There.
It's coming from over there.
Derek!
Lexie!
Derek! Lexie!
Lexie.
Is somebody there?
Oh, y--I'm--I'm here. I'm here.
I can't...
I can't...
I'm--I'm stuck in here.
Oh, don't do that. Don't do that.
I have to help.
Stop. Stop.
I-I can't get outta here.
Wh-what's your name?
Jerry.
Jerry, I'm Arizona.
I don't want you to move, okay?
'Cause you could--you could injure yourself more.
The controls just... I...
I think one of the engines quit.
I... Is anybody else alive?
Um... yeah.
Yeah, we're all alive. Well, I-I...
I-I think we're all alive.
You're all surgeons.
What's funny?
I am... I'm married to an orthopedic surgeon,
and I'm staring at my bone.
It's not... it's not funny.
I...I think I'm in a little bit of sh...shock.
Okay.
But really, I'm fine.
It's okay,
if I could just get myself to stop laughing.
Arizona?
Yeah? Yeah?
I can't feel my legs.
Yeah, I knew that was bad.
Lexie. Lexie.
I knew you'd show up.
How is she?
She's awake and responsive.
How are you doing in there?
I'm...I'm great.
Yeah? Good girl.
We're gonna get you outta here, okay?
Okay.
She's tachycardic and short of breath.
We have to find Derek.
Okay, you know what? We've got Lexie.
So go. Go find him.
Go, go. Go try and find him.
We gotta get her outta there.
Pop it back in.
Pop it back in.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Okay, do it.
Oh, God!
Derek! Derek!
Derek!
Derek!
Derek!
Derek!
Meredith?
Derek!
Meredith.
Derek!
Meredith.
Derek!
Meredith.
Sir.
Have you seen Dr. Altman?
No, but, um, sir, you have a few messages.
Is anybody dying?
No.
Is it Dr. Yang?
No.
Then send all calls to voice mail.
I have multiple traumas coming in.
I don't have time. And find me Altman.
All right. Where do you want me, chief?
Incoming.
Building collapsed on a bunch of firefighter recruits.
Last day of their training. Happy graduation.
Okay, well, you have me till 7:00.
I've got a dinner with the last group of residents tonight.
I do not understand why you're spending your week
taking the residents out to dinner.
Come on, Hunt. It's a tradition.
We're celebrating a milestone.
You're welcome to join.
I'll pass.
Oh, I'm telling you, it's an evening you won't forget,
and the kids, they just love it.
Could someone please mercy kill me
so I don't have to go to this thing?
You do me, I'll do you.
Better leave me a bullet. Hell if I'm going alone.
Yang and Grey skipped town at the perfect time.
Oh, no, they will be back in time for the dinner.
Because I had to pick up their stupid dry cleaning
and--and dig through their stupid closets
for their stupid heels,
all the while babysitting Mer's stupid kid.
She's not stupid. She's actually adorable.
Hey, you decide on Tulane yet?
No, I'm still weighing my options.
Lot of factors involved.
At least you have options.
Hey, want to hear mine? When I go back to Moline,
do I work at the tastee freez or milk cows on the farm?
Tastee freeze. No-brainer.
You're still a doctor.
Just go to Tulane already.
It's a thing.
People are together, but they live apart.
"Live-apartners."
It's common enough to have a name.
Syphilis is common enough to have a name.
Doesn't mean I want it.
Who doesn't want what?
Somebody has gotten themselves a surgical internship in Los Angeles.
I'm branching out.
Congratulations.
Or not.
We wouldn't be the first commuter marriage on the planet.
You're getting married?
Oh, that's fantastic.
Okay, you should probably leave while you can.
I'm going.
Because my love is strong enough to handle the space.
Long-distance relationship? Not the end of the world.
You gonna give me some crap about "Absence makes the heart grow fonder"?
No. Absence makes the sex grow hotter.
Arizona's only been gone for one night,
and already, she's inspired a totally hot "I miss you thing"
when she gets back.
I have lingerie and flavored body paint--
Oh, there is a god.
Okay, ready? On my count. One, two...
Three.
Again.
One, two, three.
Damn it!
Lexie, run it down for me.
My legs and my pelvis are crushed.
And I can't f-feel my other arm,
so I'm not sure it's even there anymore.
And, uh, my chest feels like it's gonna explode,
so it's probably a massive... hemothorax.
Oh, oh, we-- we gotta--
we gotta get the oxygen from the plane. Okay?
And fluids. Fluids. She needs water bottles.
And, uh, uh, the tubes, the oxygen tubes.
We can get her fluids.
We can get her fluids, okay? Go get 'em.
Go. Go get 'em. Go get 'em.
Why aren't you doing anything?
She...she knows it won't... help.
No.
You are gonna be fine.
Stop. You're gonna be fine.
Go! Get 'em!
I'm gonna be right back.
I've got a lot of free fluid in the upper right quadrant.
Somebody call C.T.
Right away, doctor.
Open femur in two.
Strong pulse. He's good.
I need those chest films, please.
Right away.
What's up?
I just got a call from Rita Simon this morning.
Really? I...I haven't heard from Rita Simon since Baghdad.
Yeah, I was surprised, too, especially when she asked me
If I knew if you were taking the chief job at Medcom.
I...I was gonna tell you.
But you didn't.
I've already lost the head of neuro to Harvard,
and now I have to find a new head of cardio
on top of everyone else?
I'm not taking the job.
I...I just haven't had time to tell Medcom.
What...what do you mean, you're...
Let's get him ready for C.T.
I'm gonna try and splint this.
No, I can do it. I can do it.
Jerry needs C-spine stabilization.
Who's Jerry?
How are you doing there, Jerry?
I give us four hours tops before they find us.
There's a transmitter in the plane
that lets out a squawk that should lead 'em right to us.
Did you find Derek?
Not yet.
Jerry, do you, have any tape?
Uh, yeah. In the bulkhead.
In the cabinet to your left.
There's a flare gun in there, too.
Yes.
You hear a chopper, you fire it straight up.
And Lexie?
Not good.
Oh, great. Great, great, great, great, great.
Okay, keep your head very still.
Yeah. Okay.
Good, good.
Jerry...
Is there a first aid kit?
A...yeah, a big one.
In the cabinet on your right,
behind the cockpit.
There's no cabinet there.
Just tell her to hang on for another four hours.
Great.
Hey, hey, wait. Don't leave!
I...I can't feel my legs.
That's because I'm trapped, right?
I mean, I'm gonna be okay, right?
I'm not paralyzed. I'm gonna walk again.
I'm gonna be okay, right?
I'm sorry.
Cristina.
I can't find him. I looked everywhere.
I can't find him.
Maybe he's fine.
Maybe he went for help.
Maybe, but I gotta...I gotta keep looking.
No, Meredith.
You should come... help Lexie.
You're doing good.
Mark...
Cristina's...Cristina's gonna be back any minute.
Mark...
She's gonna be back, and we're gonna get you stabilized,
and you're gonna be fine, okay?
Mark...
Just a few minutes, okay?
She'll be back any minute.
Mark...
I'm... I'm dying.
What? No, you're not.
I am.
Please... tell...
tell Meredith
that I love her.
And that she's a good sister.
Please t-tell my dad...
You're not dying. You're gonna be fine.
Hold my hand.
I'm not holding your hand because you're not dying.
Hold my hand.
No. You're not dying.
Do you hear me?
You don't die today.
I love you.
You don't have to say it
because I said it.
I do. I love you.
I love you. I've always been in love with you.
I will always be in love with you.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Which is why you have to stay alive.
We--we-- we're gonna get married.
And you're gonna make an amazing surgeon.
And we're gonna have two or three kids.
So Sofia can have siblings.
Yeah. A sister and two brothers.
And... that's nice.
We're gonna be happy, Lex...
You and me.
We're gonna have the best life, Lexie,
you and me.
We're gonna be so happy.
So you can't die, okay?
You can't die,
because we're supposed to end up together.
We're meant to be.
Meant to be.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I-I love you.
I love you.
I love you. I love you. I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Lexie.
Your wife is bonkers.
Yeah, but she's cute.
No, she pulled me off every single peds case before she left.
She's punishing me for choosing Hopkins.
You know what? I don't care. I'm calling her right now.
Hey, Karev, no. Put that phone away.
No good's gonna come out of that.
I'm pissed.
Yeah, well, so is she.
You know why? 'Cause she loves you.
She'll get over it.
The best thing you can do is just leave it alone.
Wait till she come back.
Talk to her tomorrow when you've both calmed down.
If you got nothing to do, scrub in with me.
I've got an open femur. Oh, there you are.
Why tomorrow? I thought she was coming back tonight.
Uh, tonight I've got things planned
that don't include her screaming your name.
Will you at least tell me why?
Why what?
Why you turned down the job at Medcom.
No.
Altman.
Hunt.
Tell me.
No.
Somebody want to tell me what Medcom is?
It would make this a whole lot more fun for me.
Army medical command.
They oversee every medical operation
in the U.S. and in Europe.
Fancy.
Very.
She'd be instructing,
innovating surgical field techniques,
and they're interested in funding her stem cell research.
Sounds like a good fit.
It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
So I just don't understand...
So what, now you're pissed that I'm not leaving?
Where's your loyalty?
You're being asked to serve your country.
Do you know where we are right now, Hunt?
This is the room where my husband died.
Right here on this table.
And no matter how many wonderful and amazing
and miraculous things happen in this room,
it will always be the room where my husband died.
And the south elevator
will always be the place where I met him,
and... and the cafeteria will always be the place
where he bought my lunch.
I would love to leave here and never look back.
But you are as beaten
and broken as I have ever seen you.
And after everything that I have put you through,
the tolerance and kindness...
and friendship that you have shown me,
I am not going to leave you
because of my loyalty.
I am not going to leave here for Medcom or anywhere else.
This isn't holding. 3-0 prolene, please.
Derek!
Derek!
I don't understand how this keeps happening.
Cristina, we have to find him.
I'm serious.
I do not understand how this keeps happening.
We have to find him,
because I don't think he went for help.
We keep dying. We're in a plane crash, Mer.
Like... like right now.
If he went for help, if Derek had gone for help,
he would've sent a message or something.
I mean, we have to find him. Something is wrong.
I can tell you one thing. When we get out of here,
I am getting the hell away from Seattle Grace Mercy death,
and I'm never looking back!
Cristina...
I think Derek is dead.
He would've come for us by now.
He definitely would've come for us by now.
I think he's dead. And Lexie's dead.
My husband and sister are both dead!
And we are gonna die out here, too!
We are gonna die out here--
Keep it together. Keep it together.
No, you keep it together!
I'm trying!
All right. Look. Keep-- keep it together anyway.
Keep it together anyway.
My sister is dead.
Keep it together anyway.
Do you think Derek is dead?
I don't know. Maybe.
But I've got P.T.S.D., so you know I'm not reliable.
Cristina...
you are still my person,
even if I'm not yours.
Meredith, Meredith.
Meredith.
Oh, I heard your voice.
I thought I-- I thought I was dreaming.
Oh, my God.
Oh, I found it!
The first aid box?
My shoe.
Is she gonna be okay?
She's not barefoot anymore.
Well, I guess that's something.
Aah! Son of a--damn it.
I know.
Oh, son of a--
I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Okay.
Where's Lexie?
Clothes.
No?
Okay, let's just keep it together, okay?
Clothes.
Loosen the tourniquet a little bit.
You'll bleed to death.
I need to save my hand.
Well, I'm trying to save your life.
Oh, safety pin. Safety pin.
Bring that.
Do you have a T-shirt or a bandana?
Got it. Got it.
Okay, we have to close the wound.
Use the safety pin.
Weave your way inside and out
and then put the bandana on top of it
and tape it.
And what's the-- what's the T-shirt for?
Put it in my mouth. I'm probably gonna scream a lot,
and I'm gonna--I'm gonna-- I'm gonna pass out.
Okay.
Good.
Sorry. I'm Sorry.
Please pass out. Please pass out.
Please pass out. Please pass out.
Please pass out. Please pass out.
Please pass out. Please pass out.
Kepner, you'll have to close up for me.
I have to preorder our duck--
Uh, slow-roasted,
It takes six hours, falls off the bone.
Oh, the residency dinner. Can I come?
Oh, you've had your turn. Now it's theirs.
You kids jazzed about dinner?
Yes, sir.
Yeah?
Oh, very jazzed.
Yum.
Well, call me Miles Davis, 'cause I'm jazzed.
I'll give you 10 bucks to stab me in the face right now.
Hey.
Now I know why you were trying so hard to keep her here.
If Cristina were staying, you'd be taking that job.
I'll be fine.
No, no, Owen, you won't.
You are losing the love of your life.
Yeah.
Everywhere I look, I expect to see her.
She's not even gone, and I miss her already.
I wish I could tell you that will go away,
but it won't.
Matches. Yes, God. Finally.
Fire. We can build a fire.
We should. They'll see a fire.
Let's get a fire started.
Yeah, Mark. We need-- we need to start a fire.
Mark. Mark.
You have to help.
I-I'll figure out how to get it started.
No, no.
You know what? He doesn't get to do this.
He doesn't get to stop helping.
I'm sorry he lost Lexie,
but she was your sister, and you're still helping.
He has to help because the sky is falling, Mark.
Cristina.
No, no, no.
You know, if there's one thing that I've learned
with all the--the bombs and the guns to my head
and--and the buses running down my friends
is that I am not interested in dying.
I want to get out of here, and I want to go home.
And everyone has to help.
Mark, get up.
Get up and help, Mark.
Get up.
Mark? Mark? Mark?
Mark.
Please. Please be okay.
Mark.
Oh, crap.
Mer!
What happened?
When I rechecked him, he had
muffled heart sounds and J.V.D.
Delayed tamponade?
It's a cardiac tamponade.
Are you sure?
75%.
70%. 70% sure.
That's not very sure.
Well, if you want me to be sure, get me an ultrasound.
Will you man the ultrasound?
Thank you.
Looks like the pericardium's about to burst.
We have to drain his pericardial sac
and relieve the pressure, or--or his heart will stop.
With what?
We don't even have an 18-guage spinal needle.
All right. 18 gauge.
Okay, I got it. Okay.
Hold this. Take the top off.
Okay. Why?
Use that right there.
Ohh. Use the tube.
Brilliant. Brilliant. Okay, this will work. All right. Sure.
Sanitize that.
Is the tubing long enough?
I'm going in, um, subxiphoid. Knife.
Okay, needle.
Here. Here you go, Mer.
All right, Mark. Try not to move.
Easy, Mark. It's okay. Don't move. It's gonna be okay.
Aim for his left shoulder.
Wait. Don't. You'll puncture his heart.
I know, I know, I know.
Careful. Don't puncture the heart.
I know.
Okay.
Deeper!
Good. Excellent.
That's it. That's it. That's it. Great.
Very good. It's gonna be okay.
That's good. That's it. That's exactly it.
You did it.
Just let it drain into here.
Oh, you did it. You got it.
I got it. I got the bag.
You got it.
There.
Wanna go for lunch?
Hey! What the hell are you doing?
Eating.
No. No. You have a dinner tonight.
The--the biggest dinner of your lives.
Here's the thing, I can't eat duck.
I had a duck on the farm. It lived in the house.
So order the steak.
Here's the thing, I had a cow--
Look, no one really wants to go tonight.
He's preordering the duck.
Come on. Where's--where's your sense of occasion?
In Baltimore at Hopkins.
Webber and I have issues. Oh, he knows what he did.
I failed my boards. I have nothing to celebrate.
Oh, poor April fails her test. Big whoop!
I got fired from chief resident,
then I got fired from this hospital.
Oh, my husband cheated on me.
W--you were married to a man?
And then he died.
So I didn't think I was gonna ever be happy again.
But now my life is pretty damn great.
So you're having a rough time. It's nothing.
It's a blip.
And in the meantime, you're missing your moment.
You survived residency.
Stop and celebrate that.
'Cause life... changes in an instant.
It turns on a dime.
One minute you're miserable,
and then the next...
you've met the most amazing woman in the world
and are in love.
This moment, your moment,
it only happens once.
Oh, and the duck
is freakin' amazing.
Hey.
Mark?
What happened?
Tamponade.
Mer did a pericardiocentesis.
Oh, my God.
He's holding on for now.
Where's Lexie?
Where's Lexie?
Lexie's dead.
So we should get a fire started.
Oh, I've got-- I've got the matches.
We have five left.
Make it big so they see.
What happened to the four hours, Jerry?
It's been more than four hours.
Shh. Listen.
What does that mean?
I mean, does that mean that they're not coming for us?
I mean, you said four hours. You said four hours tops.
Ch-chopper!
Oh, my God. It's a helicopter!
Help! Help!
Where is it?
I don't see it. I don't see it. Help!
Get the flare gun!
The flare gun!
In the bag! In the bag!
Oh, God, shoot it! We're down here!
Come back!
Why isn't it working?
Shoot it again! Shoot it again!
Give it to me.
Help!
Help!
Oh, my God, no!
Help!
Oh, my God. No, no! Come back!
No, no, no!
I chose Tulane.
Good.
That's good for you.
I feel sick, by the way.
Sick to leave here,
to leave you.
But...
I'm glad--I'm glad you're so friggin' happy about it.
I'm not.
I'm not happy with any of it.
I'm not happy that everything I thought I was
turns out not to be true.
I'm not a board-certified surgeon.
I'm not a virgin. I'm not a good Christian.
I don't know what I am, but I know I'm not happy.
I loved having sex with you.
You made me feel things...
You changed me, Jackson.
And I loved that.
But I hate that I'm not a virgin
for the man I'm gonna marry.
I'm not freakin' happy about that.
And I'm really not happy that you feel bad about it,
'cause you're my best friend.
But you know what?
Torres is right.
My problems will still be my problems tomorrow
and the day after that and the day after that.
And in a few weeks,
my best friend will be at Tulane,
and I may never see him again, so...
for one night, I'm just gonna forget all about that.
And I'm gonna try.
I'm gonna try to be happy.
I'm happy tonight.
I am gonna be happy, Jackson,
'cause this is a happy time,
and we should be celebrating, okay?
So can you please just wipe that freakin' frown off your face
and be happy with me?
You look really nice.
So do you.
This is Dr. Robbins.
Leave me your name and number, and I'll get right back to you.
Thanks.
Hey, um, it's Alex.
Listen, um...
Look, the only reason Hopkins wants me
is because you made me something.
All right, you made me, and I still don't know why.
You said one time that you saw something in me,
and I mean, most of me thinks you're nuts, but...
I gotta go to Hopkins 'cause I gotta see
if I'm something when you're not there,
holding my hand, you know?
I guess I'm saying thanks or whatever.
I-I don't know.
If you want to be pissed about it,
then be pissed about it.
Bye.
Hey, they don't know where we are.
They don't know where we are.
It's because the transmitter's probably been damaged
in the crash.
If the transmitter's damaged...
We could be here for days.
Yeah.
Zola.
Owen has got to have figured out we're missing.
I know he sent someone.
Mark?
I shoulda said it earlier...
That I loved her. I shoulda said it earlier.
She...
She knew.
I think she knew.
She didn't know.
She didn't know.
Mark...
Mark, hold on.
Okay, I need you-- I need you to hold on.
You'll be okay.
You don't need me.
You take care of our girls.
No. Shut up.
Shut up. Do you hear me? Shut up.
Lexie's waiting for me.
I'll be okay.
No! Mark Sloan,
No! Hey! No.
No. Sofia's waiting for you,
and Callie is waiting for you,
and I am waiting for you.
We're gonna go home together, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay. Thank you. Mm-hmm.
Hey. You were looking for me?
We need to talk.
No.
We don't.
I am happy to stay.
It'll be fun. It'll be like old times.
Like you and me back in Iraq.
You're fired.
That's good.
Effective immediately.
Hunt--
I wish it were different,
but this is just the way things are shaking out.
Now I know you have other opportunities,
so if you need to make those phone calls, then--
Owen, stop it. Stop it. You can't just do this.
You can't-- you can't just--
I can and I did.
You can't just--
I already e-mailed the board.
You can't just tell me when to go and when to stay!
I don't want you here anymore!
You shoulda seen this coming.
For months, for months, you have been disruptive in the O.R.,
You have been hostile and insubordinate...
Oh, my god.
to me in front of staff and in front of students.
I can't have that.
I am the chief of surgery.
Owen, I-I was--I was-- I was...
We're past all of that.
We are,
because you're fired.
It's a done deal. Pack your stuff.
You son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch!
Damn it.
You don't lose her.
You fight. You fight for her. You hear me?
You go.
And you be great.
You don't get to make decisions on your own
without a heads-up anymore.
You don't say, "Uh, oh, maybe
I'll apply to be an intern,
we'll see how it goes.
I'll bring it up with Miranda if anything comes of it,
but for now, it's my little secret
between me and me."
That's not your life anymore.
When you are sharing your life with a person,
you talk to them, you think with them,
you make decisions with them,
you are loyal to them.
You are not a free agent anymore.
Do you understand me?
Does this mean we're still getting married?
Well, what do you...
I proposed to you!
In a trench coat and a thong,
proving once again that no good can ever come from a thong,
but here I am, proposing again.
What, you want a skywriter?
It was clear with the coat and the thong.
You know what?
You put a piece of string in your tail
and see if you want to do it twice.
You know, this may be the most romantic conversation of my life.
Well, I'm not proposing romance, mister.
I'm proposing marriage, and if you're not prepared to--
You love me, don't you?
I am... very angry with you.
So pissed, you're just gonna marry me,
just to spite me.
Yes. Exactly.
Tell me it's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be wonderful.
Good morning, Dr. Hunt.
This is Dr. Sheehan over at Boise Memorial.
I just wanted to double-check what time your surgeons
were set to arrive today.
Dr. Hunt, Dr. Sheehan again.
Still no word from your surgeons.
I'm gonna check in with the airport
to see if the weather held 'em up.
Uh, any word from Yang or Grey?
No. Plane should've landed an hour ago.
They'll show.
Well, you know...
there's a little bit of advice
I like to give at these dinners every year.
It's a secret that will help all of you
get through the challenges that lie ahead.
You know, um...
we should wait for the rest of them.
This is Dr. Sheehan again.
We're starting to get a bit concerned here.
I'm hungry.
Think of something else.
I'm hungry.
I have a stick of gum.
I don't want gum. I want food.
Shoot.
Great.
We have one match left.
No sleeping.
You have to stay awake.
Okay.
Derek. Derek.
You, too.
I want everyone conscious!
Boats.
Mer, light the match.
Careful. It's our last one.
Okay.
The years we spend as surgical residents
will be the best
and worst of our lives.
We will be pushed to our breaking point.
This is the starting line.
This is our arena.
How well we play,
