traditional &quot; first day of school &quot; pancakes .
whipped @-@ cream smile ?
dad , i &apos;m in high school now .
just put it in my mouth .
okay , that &apos;s disgusting . stop it .
hey , save some of that bossing people around
for the office , lady .
after a 20 @-@ year vacation ,
claire is rejoining the work force .
not a vacation .
but i am starting a job at my dad &apos;s closet company .
he &apos;s kind of grooming me to take over .
i have a background in marketing .
i &apos;m so proud of her .
oh , uh , speaking of marketing -- we &apos;re out of milk .
i &apos;m actually kind of nervous .
you &apos;re gonna be great .
and remember , if you get into a jam ,
just do the impression i taught you .
hey . you can hang your clothes in me .
christopher walk @-@ in closet .
i &apos;m not doing that .
okay , relax , mom . you &apos;re working for grandpa .
it &apos;s not even a real job .
it &apos;s like that summer when i worked for dad .
he was just trying to make me feel good about myself .
he didn &apos;t really need my help .
that &apos;s not true .
i needed your help distributing all those fliers .
and i did . wink , wink .
how are you already doing homework ?
it &apos;s junior year . i have to get good grades .
don &apos;t you know how competitive it is out there ?
stop pressuring me !
you know , this is what happens to kids
when they &apos;re not sexually active .
don &apos;t you have some studying to do ?
please , it &apos;s community college .
they tell you to bring a glue stick .
hello .
yes , this is he -- him -- me .
right the first time .
i &apos;ll be right there .
mitchell , that was it .
that was the call . i &apos;m going in .
due to budget cuts , my position as middle @-@ school music teacher
has been eliminated ,
so i &apos;ve been working as a high @-@ school sub .
ka @-@ ching !
i never know when i &apos;ll be summoned to swoop into action .
i &apos;m kind of like batman .
but except for a bat @-@ signal , i get a phone call .
yeah , you found the one difference .
i hate to miss her first day ,
but do you mind taking lily to school ?
oh , cam , today ?
i got to prep for my meeting with charlie .
i only get him for an hour
between his vacations in aspen and cabo .
okay , you need to confront him
and tell him his pathetic little midlife crisis
is making it impossible for you to do your job .
because he responds so well to criticism .
no , he &apos;ll fire me , and then we &apos;ll end up
having to get married in your family &apos;s barn .
oh , well , we need to book that soon
because spring is hoedown season ,
and then you get right into summer stock , so ...
i don &apos;t believe any of that .
all right , if i &apos;m gonna take lily , i need to hurry .
lily , sweetheart , let &apos;s get you dressed .
hey , i &apos;ve been dressed for an hour .
come on , i can &apos;t be late . i &apos;ll fall behind .
sometimes i forget to factor in the asian .
buddy , i know a new school can be scary ,
so a little advice --
every time you meet someone new , pay them a compliment .
like , um , &quot; i love your hair . &quot;
&quot; awesome kicks . &quot; &quot; you have a beautiful smile . &quot;
okay , dad , i &apos;ll tell that big guy over there
that he &apos;s got a beautiful smile .
fine . skin , cheekbones , make it your own .
um , could you maybe not walk me all the way in ?
what ?
i &apos;ve got it from here .
sure . yeah . okay . give your dad a --
off you go . alex !
ay , manny , why are you so quiet ?
are you nervous because of your first day in high school ?
mom , after spending a summer in colombia ,
i &apos;m a changed man .
oh , my god , what did you see ? !
nothing ,
but i am an international jet @-@ setter now .
i &apos;m sophisticated .
and you think that the girls are gonna pick up on this ?
if not , i still have my &quot; unaccompanied minor &quot; sign .
ay , i cannot believe
that my little baby &apos;s going to the high school .
mom , stop . you &apos;re embarrassing me .
it &apos;s my first day , too . i could use a hug .
go !
hey , gloria .
hi , phil .
first day of high school , huh ?
is manny excited ?
ay , he was up at 5 : 00 in the morning , ironing .
ay , but he does that , too , when he &apos;s depressed ,
so now i don &apos;t know .
how was luke ?
great . yeah , he had a hard time saying goodbye .
but , um , anyway , i think i &apos;m gonna go get a cup of coffee .
can i go with you ?
yeah .
dude , i &apos;m kind of working something here .
how many trucks would that take ?
give me a minute , fred .
new girl just walked in .
that &apos;s disgusting . she &apos;s my daughter .
sweetheart , you look terrific .
are you sure ?
&apos;cause i have another blouse in -- in here .
it &apos;s the only thing in here , that and a pair of glasses
in case i need to read something or look smarter .
relax .
it &apos;s your first day .
impossible to blow it . what are those ?
oh , cookies -- i made them for the office .
huge mistake . fred , two more seconds .
i got a situation here . put the cookies down .
why ?
you &apos;re management .
makes you look desperate .
makes you look like you want everyone to like you .
i do want everyone to like me .
you want everyone to respect you .
you got to be tough . keep your distance .
well , maybe we are different kinds of managers .
yeah , i &apos;m yours . just leave the cookies .
look at you , my big first @-@ grader .
all right , i want you to make so many friends
and have so much fun .
got to go ! i can &apos;t wait to learn !
be careful !
what ?
nothing .
please do not be late . let &apos;s go . looking good .
uh , uh , principal brown ?
yes .
hi . i &apos;m cameron tucker .
i was called in to sub today .
oh , yeah , you &apos;re in for mrs. hurley . hello .
hello .
she has come down with a sudden case of rehab .
so do a good job
&apos;cause this could be a permanent position .
well , prepare to feel like an old denim vest
because i &apos;m about to &quot; be @-@ dazzling &quot; you .
i don &apos;t know what that means , but okay .
so , what am i teaching ?
a.p. history .
i desperately wanted that job .
there was just one problem --
i don &apos;t know much about history .
do you know much biology ?
not now , mitchell .
what about your science book or the french you took ?
you &apos;re lucky i love you .
and i know that if you love me , too ...
* what a wonderful world this would be *
i really was in a jam , though .
my dad thinks that he can motivate his workers
by being a cold , distant authority figure .
well , if his style is so effective , riddle me this --
why didn &apos;t i listen to him ?
hey .
hi . sorry . i &apos;m claire .
it &apos;s my first day , so i thought i &apos;d say hi .
oh . hey .
amazing .
you guys are actually hanging out by the water cooler .
i have xerostomia . it &apos;s chronic dry mouth .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m so sorry .
i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i was just doin &apos; a thang , you know , like ...
anyway ,
my door &apos;s always open ... to everyone .
that &apos;s pritchett &apos;s daughter .
um , yeah , but i don &apos;t want you to think of me like that .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m a friend . i &apos;m a colleague .
i &apos;m just like you .
i &apos;m claire , you know -- worker bee , just ...
great to meet you .
sorry to interrupt , and see you around .
i do -- i got to do this one .
who am i ?
you can hang your clothes in me .
christopher walk @-@ in closet .
what is this ?
oh , sorry , folks . it &apos;s closed . we &apos;re shooting a commercial .
so annoying .
listen , we just want to get a cup of coffee .
actually , we &apos;re short a couple of extras .
how would you two like to be in it ?
yes !
that sounds amazing .
hey , um , i see a couple of old people .
this isn &apos;t one of those catheter commercials , is it ?
&apos;cause if it gets too descriptive ,
i &apos;m gonna squirm .
i just did it to myself .
i did my best to cram for my lecture
on the revolutionary war , but , ugh .
all those names and dates -- it &apos;s all so dry .
where &apos;s the drama ?
good morrow !
oh , boy .
oh , what is all this strange garb you adorn ?
are you trappers from the canadian provinces ?
are you here to sell your beavers ?
who are you ?
the 64 @-@ pence question .
i crossed the delaware during the revolutionary war .
i spent a brutal winter in valley forge .
who am i ?
i @-@ i have no idea .
i @-@ i swear i don &apos;t know who this man is .
i &apos;m george washington , of course .
our syllabus says we &apos;re supposed to cover
native americans on the eve of colonization .
yes . native americans . indians !
a majestic , peaceful people ,
who lived off the land and cried when they saw litter .
the textbook says many tribes were often at war ,
with allegiances shifting all of the ti--
shifting all the time !
so , were the indians friends with the colonists or not ?
ah ! yes .
i know one indian
who was friends with a construction worker , biker ,
and traffic cop .
uh , do y-- nothing ?
seriously , nothing ?
okay , your parents are gonna love that joke .
okay , pritchett , i &apos;m here . you got a half @-@ hour .
i have my helicopter standing by on the roof .
is it even built for that ?
no . that &apos;s why you only have a half @-@ hour .
well , i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s gonna be enough time .
we have a ton to cover .
we need to talk about new lease agreements
and the workers &apos; comp package .
29 minutes . i think i hear creaking .
daddy , i &apos;m bored .
me , too .
this is why i shouldn &apos;t come into work between vacations .
why don &apos;t you sit at natalie &apos;s desk
and pretend to be my assistant , sweetie ?
sorry about that . my niece is coming to pick her up .
lily had an incident at school today where she --
hey , pritchett ,
you &apos;re not some hot single mom i &apos;m trying to seduce ,
so i don &apos;t need to hear about your kid .
fair enough . so , lease agreements .
okay , i &apos;m getting some push @-@ back on the miami location .
mr. pritchett , i have a haley here to see you .
oh . okay .
hi , sweetheart .
i &apos;m in the middle of a meeting with my boss ,
but thank you so much for helping me out .
no problem .
my last class is a pass / fail .
and it &apos;s community college , so it &apos;s pass .
hi . charlie bingham .
look at your eyes .
oh . i @-@ i can &apos;t .
i like you .
what do you think of these pants ?
it &apos;s part of our new collection .
it &apos;s , uh , a lot of zippers .
it &apos;s too many , right ?
and they poke into my thigh when i &apos;m in my helicopter .
&apos;cause i have a helicopter . it &apos;s not a big deal .
okay , so , anyway , thank you .
you seem to know a lot about fashion .
i &apos;d like to get your opinion on a few things .
sure .
yeah ?
yeah . - actually , no , she -- she needs to stay and watch lily .
yeah , you can do that .
hey , princess . hey .
i love kids .
daddy &apos;s office .
you sound like a little girl .
hey , you wanted to see me ?
thanks for &quot; bzzzing &quot; by .
i hope you weren &apos;t in the middle of a &quot; thang . &quot;
okay , that did get a little away from me .
but to be fair , i broke the ice .
everybody thinks you &apos;re a dummy .
not everybody . no , as a matter of fact ,
one of the guys in the break room asked me to lunch .
his name is todd .
don &apos;t say todd .
oh , no .
you cannot go to lunch with todd .
why not ?
you can &apos;t be associated with him .
up until an hour ago ,
he was the office weirdo .
but he was nice to me ,
and he helped me set up my computer .
yeah , that &apos;s his job . for now .
what does that mean ?
i &apos;m firing him as soon as i can find an i.t. guy
who shows up on time
and doesn &apos;t creep out the office .
i can &apos;t cancel on the one person who was nice to me .
you can , but you won &apos;t ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re the type of person who brings cookies to the office .
where are they ?
okay , we &apos;re done here .
okay , folks , you &apos;re just having a normal conversation ,
a typical day in a coffee shop , all right ?
roger that .
here we go , guys .
and ... action !
how have you been , roy ?
ah , a little down .
helen and i really miss the kids ,
but we just can &apos;t afford to visit them right now .
have you considered a reverse mortgage ?
what &apos;s that ?
you have equity in your home , right ?
this coffee is delicious !
all right , you two in the back , we can hear you ,
so just mime your conversation .
mime -- mime -- i knew that .
i was already doing that , so just follow my lead .
okay , sorry , sorry . we &apos;ll do it again .
but everything else is okay ?
you haven &apos;t done anything else .
so , yeah ?
back to one , guys .
action .
how have you been , roy ?
ah , a little down .
helen and i really miss the kids ,
but we just can &apos;t afford to visit them right now .
have you considered a reverse mortgage ?
what &apos;s that ?
you have equity in your home , right ?
sure , we do .
what are they doing ?
is she answering an imaginary phone ?
oh , that sounds too good to be true .
don &apos;t take my word for it .
here &apos;s henry winkler to tell you more .
okay , cut .
couple in the back .
yep . no , i know . i know . bigger ?
the native americans and the settlers
had two completely different ideas of land ownership .
eventually , these differences would lead to war .
oh . look , goose bumps .
okay , yes . uh , class dismissed .
we did it !
thank you so much for stepping in . oh , and i promise ,
tomorrow , i will do my best to be more prepared .
tomorrow ? why won &apos;t mrs. hurley be back ?
well , i don &apos;t want to be indelicate ,
but the good news is , is i might be your permanent teacher .
i don &apos;t want you to be my permanent teacher .
oh , what ?
you &apos;d rather have a raging alcoholic ?
listen to me .
i &apos;ve worked nonstop to build the perfect academic record ,
and i &apos;m not going to let you screw it up now .
i have an a.p. test in 160 days ,
and i need to ace it .
can you get me there or not ?
i can rally like the brave men of the alamo .
you do realize that all the men of the alamo died ?
they all died !
ruthie &apos;s older , so she thinks she &apos;s the boss .
but for a little guy , stu holds his own .
they can be a handful .
but , god , they make me laugh so hard , you know ?
i did not know you could even tell the gender of a turtle .
oh , yeah .
it &apos;s called &quot; sexing the turtle , &quot; and it &apos;s an eight @-@ step process .
now , let &apos;s pretend your hand is a turtle .
okay .
what you do is you flip it over .
and then you have to look right into --
oh , okay . i get it . i get it . i think i get it .
oh . i know . i &apos;m droning on , aren &apos;t i ?
please , stop . please stop !
you &apos;re not . you &apos;re not .
i am . but enough about my family .
tell me about yours .
all right , well , my husband phil &apos;s a realtor .
that &apos;s funny . i &apos;m buying a house .
why ? when ?
actually , we have the final walk @-@ through today ,
sign the papers tomorrow .
th @-@ that &apos;s a really big deal , todd .
yeah , and it &apos;s a bit of a stretch for us , too ,
but , uh , no , the time is right .
we &apos;re just -- we &apos;re gonna do it .
&quot; we &quot; is you and the turtles ?
no , me and my wife .
a w-- i &apos;m sorry .
you didn &apos;t mention your wife . that &apos;s great .
i bet she &apos;s got a big , fancy , high @-@ paying job , right ?
uh , she &apos;s getting her master &apos;s .
in ?
latin .
oh , todd .
this may not be the best time to buy a house .
i hate to be the one to break this to you --
oh . no , no , no , no , i got this .
no , you don &apos;t .
stand by , everyone .
i really felt like i nailed that last one .
i still feel so stiff .
i don &apos;t know what to pretend saying .
you &apos;re thinking too much . just draw from your own life .
like , how was your day today ?
lousy . my own son didn &apos;t want to hug me .
okay , so use that .
my character , dr. stephen wilson ,
is also sad because his son wouldn &apos;t take his advice
and he wanted to be dropped off a block away from school .
he expected that from his daughters
but thought his son would be different .
that &apos;s so sad .
but dr. stephen wilson is not going to let that
ruin breakfast with his mistress .
you know , maybe it &apos;s just time for us to --
to accept that we have to let them go .
maybe it is .
okay , everyone , here we go . we &apos;re rolling .
and action !
how have you been , roy ?
ah , a little down .
helen and i really miss the kids ,
but we just can &apos;t afford to visit them right now .
have you considered a reverse mortgage ?
what &apos;s that ?
uh , you have equity in your home , right ?
sure , we do .
please , no crying .
you &apos;re gonna make me cry , too .
well , essentially the bank buys your house .
but you still get to live in it .
that sounds too good to be true .
don &apos;t take my word for it .
here &apos;s henry winkler to tell us more .
i don &apos;t want the fonz to see me like this .
it &apos;s a prototype . it can withstand
the most extreme temperatures on the planet .
it &apos;s waterproof , and it wicks sweat .
it also repels women .
i know . i hate it . i &apos;ll burn it tonight !
aah ! actually , it doesn &apos;t burn .
anyway , if we could get back to the lease agreements here .
you &apos;re amazing . how would you fix it ?
it &apos;s too boxy .
probably have to take it in here ...
right .
... and here .
yeah , i probably overdo it in the gym .
stupid 7 % body fat .
okay , so getting back to work .
we are working . why are we working ? !
i got to go to cabo . hey , you want to come with me ?
oh , i &apos;ve , uh , never been to cabo .
yeah , she &apos;s not going to cabo &apos; cause she &apos;s half your age .
how old are you ?
who cares ?
pretty soon , i &apos;m gonna look 20 .
i &apos;ve been meditating in one of those pressurized eggs .
well , if i went to cabo ,
what would the sleeping situation be ?
not much .
okay , no , that is enough ! no ! no !
she is my niece !
okay ?
this pathetic midlife crisis of yours
is -- is hurting the company ,
and i &apos;m getting so sick of cleaning up your messes .
y @-@ you need to focus and you need to start acting your age --
your -- your real age , not your egg age .
normally , if someone talked to me that way , i &apos;d fire him .
but i respect your honesty . i respect your passion .
it &apos;s like me . i &apos;m a very passionate man .
just focus .
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
what &apos;s that creaking ?
hut ! hike !
oh , hey , you &apos;re going the wrong way !
that &apos;s the wrong way ! no !
wait . i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re right .
uh , excuse me , principal brown .
yikes . you know , most subs just play a movie .
all right , do something different , guys .
uh , listen , i @-@ i can &apos;t be your history teacher .
those kids work so hard , and they deserve someone
who knows the material and can inspire them , so ...
if you say so .
hey , i was wondering ,
what kind of play was that you were running ?
was that supposed to be a slant ?
our freshman coach quit .
i &apos;m just a glorified babysitter .
well , your receiver needs to learn to run his routes ,
or the quarterback &apos;s never gonna be able to hit him .
i @-@ i played in college .
oh . okay .
hey , tyler , you need to learn to run your routes .
what routes ?
yeah , what routes ?
well , you &apos;re gonna line up here .
take three steps .
one , two , three -- plant right ,
open left 45 degrees up the field .
okay , why don &apos;t we try it again ?
try it again ! tip !
put some zip on the ball , 18 !
hut , hut , hike !
hit him !
better . better . good job . circle back up .
all right , anyway , thank you for the opportunity .
hey , hey , how would you like to take over this team ?
well , well , that &apos;s an interesting offer .
how much does it pay ?
nothing .
are you firm on that ?
yeah , but there &apos;s a gym @-@ teacher position available .
it &apos;s all yours if you coach .
can i wear shorts ?
yeah , and you get a whistle , too .
oh , i always get a whistle when i wear shorts .
i humbly accept your offer .
huddle up , boys ! let &apos;s go ! hustle !
do you know what hustle means , 10 ? !
it really wasn &apos;t bad .
todd is a very interesting guy when you get to know him .
did he tell you about his turtles , little lulu and stan ?
ruthie and stu .
that &apos;s the name he picks ?
&quot; turtle stew &quot; ? idiot !
well , there was one little situation that came up ,
but i think i handled it pretty well .
he &apos;s about to make , um , kind of a big
hold on .
margaret , why can &apos;t i log in here ?
what &apos;s wrong with my computer ?
the whole system &apos;s down .
no one can access files . we can &apos;t get online .
where &apos;s todd ?
we can &apos;t find him anywhere , and his yaris is gone .
where are my files ? !
what the hell ?
i @-@ i might know a little something about this .
what did you do ?
kind of told todd that you were gonna fire him .
what ? !
i had to .
dad , he &apos;s about to buy a house .
but he was fine with it .
he hugged me and thanked me
and told me that it gave him time to make a plan .
gentlemen , today is a new beginning .
and that can be scary .
how did it go , mr. jet @-@ setter ?
good . really good .
do you want to talk about it ?
no .
i &apos;m gonna ask things of you that may not make sense right now .
see you tomorrow , luke .
not if i see you first .
there it is ! there &apos;s that smile .
but they will .
hey , dad .
hey , buddy .
we &apos;re at school .
yep .
success is not guaranteed .
it is not handed to you .
success is earned .
how &apos;s that data entry going ?
good . i am up to 1998 .
ah , that &apos;s when i &apos;d already been doing the job 20 years .
so maybe i should listen to you ?
get you home a lot earlier .
thanks , boss .
today , we are forging a new path , people !
the only thing we have to fear is fear itself !
wrong president .
