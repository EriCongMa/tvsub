tyler was shot three times .
we can float the theory there was a third person on the beach .
charlotte told the cops
that she saw some guy in a hoodie .
were you high last night ?
you &apos;re supposed to be on my side .
i don &apos;t care who you &apos;re protecting or why ,
but as of now , i &apos;m gonna start protecting you .
what are you gonna do with the tapes ?
one of them is gonna be found on amanda .
to frame her ...
for torching casa treadwell ?
what the hell are you doing ?
mason thinks his tapes were destroyed in a fire .
you know what this is ?
a wire receipt for $ 5 million .
it was in amanda &apos;s jacket .
let amanda go .
i can &apos;t do that .
i order daniel grayson
to the maximum security correctional facility on rikers island .
doubt is a disease .
it infects the mind ,
creating a mistrust of people &apos;s motives
and of one &apos;s own perceptions .
doubt has the ability to call into question
everything you &apos;ve ever believed about someone ...
and reinforce the darkest suspicions
of our inner circles .
&quot; emily , i need you to know
that i &apos;m not guilty of what they &apos;re accusing me .
something happened on the beach that night
that i don &apos;t yet fully understand .
i only hope you &apos;ll still be by my side
when the truth finally comes to light . &quot;
what do you want ?
well , world peace ,
but i &apos;ll start small .
croissan &apos; wich ?
look , when was the last time you ate
or slept for that matter ?
i don &apos;t have time to sleep .
daniel &apos;s about to stand trial for murder
and victoria &apos;s circling amanda as a patsy .
well , you gotta give her points for consistency .
and if amanda resurfaces ,
the second they pick her up , she gets arrested ,
it &apos;ll all come out .
it &apos;s gonna be over for you .
takeda has her . she &apos;s secure .
for now ,
but if he finds out you &apos;re going against him
by trying to get daniel sprung , well ...
takeda just might release the kraken .
then i &apos;ll deal with it .
deja vu .
i wonder what kind of box he &apos;ll make you in woodshop .
takeda was right about one thing .
i lost focus .
i became emotionally involved .
that won &apos;t happen again .
enjoy .
that &apos;s the guy . you nailed it .
your brother could go to prison
for the rest of his life for this .
is that what you want ?
yeah , mom . that &apos;s totally what i want .
then help us help him .
how many times can i say this ?
it was dark . i couldn &apos;t see the guy &apos;s face .
so you &apos;re not certain it was a guy , hmm ?
could it have been a woman ...
whose hair was tucked up into the hood ?
someone like my half sister ?
i have no idea .
amanda and i weren &apos;t exactly close growing up .
hey , charlotte .
mrs. grayson , hi .
hi , declan .
what are you doing here ?
it &apos;s orientation day , right ?
i mean ... i- if you &apos;re still cool with me
going to collins with you .
of course i am .
declan ,
i need you to think really hard
about the hooded person you saw on the beach .
charlotte &apos;s starting to think that it was a woman
you both saw in the blackness .
it &apos;s like you said , it was blackness .
it all happened so fast , i don &apos;t think i &apos;d be much help .
enough , mom . we &apos;ve got orientation .
declan needs to make a good first impression .
a word ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
let &apos;s get outta here , huh ?
my thoughts exactly ,
except i &apos;m really not feeling orientation .
it seems like more of a beach day .
any luck with the sketch ?
we &apos;re still working on it .
any leads on amanda clarke &apos;s whereabouts yet ?
my investigators are former fbi , cia , respectively .
they &apos;ll find her .
but for now , she appears to have vanished without a trace .
well , that must have taken some doing on her part .
which is why i &apos;d like to explore other avenues
of reasonable doubt .
i won &apos;t be satisfied until you exhaust every effort
to find out where she &apos;s been
and what she &apos;s been doing for the past 18 years .
that girl is involved , and i am dead certain of it .
victoria , we can &apos;t put all our eggs
into one particular basket .
if we can &apos;t prove that amanda was on the beach that night ,
the prosecution wins , and daniel stays in prison .
which is why we &apos;ll need to present the jury
with at least one other viable suspect .
well , what about jack porter ?
he was dating amanda ,
and she had him convinced that our family was somehow involved
in the terrible things that her father did .
you think they &apos;re aligned in some sort of vendetta ?
what we think is not the relevant point .
it &apos;s what the jury thinks .
maybe charlotte did see a man on the beach after all .
okay , so what &apos;s up with this urgent text ?
i &apos;ve been thinking about that wire receipt .
look , the graysons bought off your girlfriend .
what else is there to think about ?
i called the bank .
they wouldn &apos;t tell me if the account was even in amanda &apos;s name .
obviously . who else &apos;s would it be ?
that &apos;s what i want you to find out .
do your hacking thing . get into the bank records .
okay , jack ...
this is not you .
you need to just put this behind you .
how am i supposed to do that ?
okay , hey , i &apos;m on your side , man .
okay , then tell me what side i &apos;m on ,
&apos;cause i don &apos;t know anymore .
i thought amanda had something to do with tyler &apos;s murder ,
but now all signs point to daniel ,
so where the hell did she go ?
and why hasn &apos;t she contacted me ?
and what &apos;s the deal with all this money and the blood--
the blood i found on her jacket ?
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
so i &apos;m sorry , nolan , if i can &apos;t just ...
put it all behind me .
what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;re waiting for a trial date .
conrad , victoria .
i &apos;ll talk to you then .
the people vs. daniel grayson
will commence the first week of december .
well , it &apos;s as speedy a trial as we could &apos;ve hoped for , i imagine .
what about revisiting bail ?
unfortunately , we &apos;re dealing with a hard @-@ line judge .
barring a life @-@ threatening condition ,
rikers will be daniel &apos;s home for the foreseeable future .
i think the best thing that we can do for daniel right now
is to track down amanda clarke .
excuse me .
as of this morning , amanda clarke is no longer
our sole focus .
the sketch artist has come up with
an equally compelling suspect .
this looks like jack porter .
you &apos;re friendly with jack porter .
how well do you know him , exactly ?
well , how well i know him is gonna be far less important
than how he &apos;s known around town .
do we really want to
suggest to the people who are gonna make up the jury pool
that montauk &apos;s favorite son could be the killer ?
well , unless amanda clarke surfaces ,
we may never know exactly what happened that night .
and the defense could paint jack as a typically sensible man
driven to illogic by a conniving temptress .
wouldn &apos;t be the first time .
i think emily &apos;s got a point , though .
these days , a bartender makes a far less compelling target
than a member of the 1 % .
what we need is a spin doctor on our side , a good one .
somebody who can help shape the public opinion
before arguments even start .
what about mason treadwell ?
well , he hasn &apos;t returned any of my calls
since the night of the fire .
he seems to have vanished as well .
i &apos;m sure another trial of the decade
could help lure him out of hiding .
i &apos;m gonna look into it .
excuse me .
that girl just might be grayson material after all .
mrs. grayson .
what can i do for you ?
i need to get a message to an inmate at rikers .
is that something you know how to do ?
yeah . try the u.s. postal service .
it &apos;s not that kind of message .
so basically , her plan is to frame jack
to get conrad &apos;s son acquitted ?
don &apos;t you find that the least bit ironic ,
and how could you let her put jack at risk like that ?
the prosecutors already have their suspect .
they &apos;re not gonna go after jack , and if they do ,
well , i always have my one trump card to play .
&apos;cause ...
you &apos;d come clean for jack ?
all right .
what do you want me to do ?
find mason treadwell .
oh , god .
he is the perfect person to run with this story .
he has it out for amanda . we can use that .
all right , fine .
you know , speaking of amanda ,
jack is like a hangdog with a bone about this wire transfer thing .
he wants me to hack into the bank in canada to make sure
it &apos;s amanda on the receiving end of the $ 5 mil .
so that &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna do .
what ?
get him out of town and away from the graysons .
because that won &apos;t make them all the more suspicious ?
amanda was his girlfriend . he went to find her .
it makes perfect sense and it &apos;s the truth .
for once .
but , uh ...
what makes you think he &apos;ll go ?
because he loves her .
god , i miss you .
are you okay ? you look tired .
yeah , i &apos;m okay .
it &apos;s just like camp ,
only instead of people telling ghost stories around a fire ,
they just kind of scream all night from their cells .
i &apos;ll get you some earplugs .
don &apos;t bother .
someone might think i &apos;m getting special treatment .
i don &apos;t want to draw any more attention to myself
than i &apos;m already getting .
there are ways to stay safe , you know ?
keep your head up , don &apos;t look down , but don &apos;t stare either .
and don &apos;t gamble . you don &apos;t want to owe anybody anything .
you can take the girl out of juvie ...
thank you for your letter .
but you don &apos;t have to worry .
i &apos;m always gonna be here by your side ,
and so is your family .
well , at least one good thing has come out of this .
my fiance and mother have finally found common ground .
so , mason ,
this is how you &apos;ve been spending your days ?
most of them .
wine coolers ?
oh , i &apos;ve never been much of a drunkard .
fitzgerald , faulkner , hemingway , of course--
these were pillars of cirrhosis .
me ? i &apos;ve always been a lightweight .
so does this mean you &apos;ve decided against writing my biography ?
that decision was made for me .
my typewriter is now but a ...
an unsightly heap of molten dreams .
i &apos;ll never write again .
poetic justice has been served .
i can &apos;t help feeling like i bear
some responsibility for what happened .
well , if we hadn &apos;t been out to dinner
the night the fire started--
unburden yourself , nolan .
this was the work of a singular force ,
one which bears the name amanda clarke .
well , if daniel hadn &apos;t been arrested the other night ,
i &apos;d say , you sounded paranoid .
what did he do this time ?
you really don &apos;t know ?
well ... the night of his engagement party ,
a man was found shot to death on the beach .
the graysons are working off a theory
that somehow amanda set up daniel to take the fall .
i bet they are .
you know ...
that could make for a ... thrilling conclusion
to your david clarke saga .
so it &apos;s your belief that amanda
and her childhood paramour worked together
to murder tyler and frame daniel ?
correct .
well , as much as i &apos;d like to nail amanda clarke ,
it sounds like a reach .
well , have you seen the sketch ?
the sketch doesn &apos;t mean anything .
it does if you say it does .
people hang on your every word .
listen , we &apos;re not telling you what to report .
we &apos;re just asking that you do what you do best .
i &apos;ll give you exclusive access ,
and we can set up a workspace in conrad &apos;s old den .
it would make a rather brilliant multi @-@ issue series .
&quot; harper &apos;s , &quot; perhaps or &quot; vanity fair . &quot;
i could see graydon carter biting .
actually , daniel &apos;s trial is in three months ,
and things are changing so quickly .
this kind of situation calls for
real @-@ time , online blogging .
i don &apos;t know the slightest thing about blogs .
you don &apos;t have to .
i &apos;ve already secured the domain name
&quot; the treadwell report , &quot;
and i &apos;m prepared to finalize the web site design
as soon as this meeting &apos;s done .
all you have to do is write .
i &apos;ll have a room made up for you in the east wing .
what &apos;s going on ?
how is he ?
he sustained a concussion , two cracked ribs ,
and a small fracture to his left orbital bone .
my god .
you said that if he faced a life @-@ threatening condition
that the judge would reconsider bail .
clearly , the conditions in this godforsaken place are exactly that .
he could &apos;ve been killed here .
i &apos;ve already spoken to the judge .
in light of the attack and daniel &apos;s growing celebrity ,
she &apos;s agreed to revisit my argument on house arrest .
with any luck , he should be back home as soon as tomorrow .
the sooner , the better .
excuse me .
yes , jim .
who on earth would do a thing like this to daniel ?
i don &apos;t know .
victoria , are you all right ?
do you need a ride home ?
conrad &apos;s staying with charlotte .
i want to stay close to daniel
until the judge makes her decision .
closing early .
i was just about to give last call .
oh , i &apos;m not here to patronize .
i &apos;m here to discuss your future .
mason treadwell .
i know who you are .
you wrote that book about david clarke .
i may yet write one about you .
look familiar ?
the graysons claim to have two eyewitnesses
who can place you on the beach shortly after
tyler barrol was murdered .
make no mistake ,
you will take the fall ...
unless , of course , you were to
go on the record to state that ...
someone put you up to it .
amanda clarke , perhaps .
get the hell out of my bar .
hey , stop .
hey , my brother didn &apos;t do anything .
that sketch you got there , they made it up .
declan porter , i presume .
i feel for you , kiddo .
after all , it was your own report
of a hooded man on the beach
that has put your brother in this position .
there was no hooded man .
charlotte came up with that to save daniel ,
and i ... went along with it for her .
convenient switch in the narrative
now that your brother &apos;s the one at risk .
why should anybody believe you ?
because it &apos;s the truth .
charlotte was on painkillers that night ,
and she &apos;d had at least three glasses of champagne .
she doesn &apos;t know what she saw .
but you , of course , were stone sober ?
you want to hear my story or not ?
your boy get the message ?
i asked for an assault
not a rampage .
you paid for a legit beatdown .
that &apos;s what he got .
are you vicky harper ?
where did you hear that name ?
that guy bought you this .
what the hell are you doing in my room ?
i &apos;m sorry to invade your privacy .
it &apos;s not normally my style ,
but i must go where the story takes me .
well , let &apos;s see what my father thinks of your story .
be sure and show him these while we &apos;re at it .
those aren &apos;t mine .
clearly . they &apos;re prescribed to your boyfriend &apos;s brother .
so i stole a few pills .
it &apos;s none of your business or anyone else &apos;s .
actually , dear , it &apos;s a whole lot of people &apos;s business ,
especially if you mixed them with alcohol
on the night of the murder .
and who told you that ?
someone who cares about you .
my darling ,
please take some advice from a man
who knows a thing or two about selfishness and deceit .
you don &apos;t have to go down this road .
you don &apos;t have to be like the rest of your family .
last call , captain ?
why not ?
i risk federal imprisonment for you ,
and this is how i get treated ?
okay . you were right .
it &apos;s amanda &apos;s account .
any idea who wired her the money ?
well , i didn &apos;t get that far ,
but i can tell you , as of three days ago ,
she hasn &apos;t withdrawn a single cent .
what is she waiting for ?
maybe ... you .
look , if you leave now , jack ,
you can get to montreal by the time the bank opens
monday morning .
this morning ...
you told me to put all this behind me ,
and now you want me to stake out a bank ?
no . i want my friend back .
and you want answers ,
which you &apos;re clearly not gonna get here , so ...
best @-@ case scenario ... you find amanda ,
she tells you the whole story , and it turns out to be
one big shakespearean misunderstanding .
worst case--
turns out you &apos;ve been wasting your time
with a career grifter and potentially a murderer .
just sayin &apos; .
these are remarkable .
yeah .
more for what they aren &apos;t than what they are .
and what aren &apos;t they ?
complete .
my ... enduring favorite
is , of course , the very first in the series ,
i like to call ...
&quot; dominik wright : unfinished . &quot;
it &apos;s practically vintage now .
i suppose this whole lot will ...
one day prove to be my legacy--
a career and life of unrealized potential .
it &apos;s very van gogh .
well , why not simply finish them ?
simply ?
that was very good , vick .
here .
how &apos;s that ?
you know , a long time ago , i ...
i told a ...
a vibrant young woman
that i &apos;d never experienced anything close to the passion
i felt when i painted her .
and i knew--i knew--
with absolute clarity ...
that i was in love with her .
and do you know how that person responded ?
i told you i didn &apos;t think
i could fall in love with anyone .
i never believed that ,
not until the day you ran off
and actually ...
married that bloke .
带子是她偷的
you know , i grow these babies
up on the roof .
when they bloom , i boil them ,
extract the pigment .
what was it you used to say ?
that flowers were the earth &apos;s way of laughing .
yeah , emerson said something like that .
well , you always were able to improve on the original .
what time is it ?
don &apos;t know . nearly 8 : 00 .
where have you been ? i &apos;ve left half a dozen messages .
my phone died .
has something happened ?
yes , seeing as you care to ask .
our motion was upheld .
daniel &apos;s being released on $ 10 million bail .
he &apos;ll be able to spend the rest of the trial here ,
under house arrest .
oh , thank god .
i &apos;m still in new york ,
so i &apos;ll go see daniel right away .
you know what ? don &apos;t bother . he &apos;s already been processed .
the police caravan is on the way to the house now
along with every news crew on the eastern seaboard .
i &apos;m sorry . i have to go .
don &apos;t worry , darling .
it &apos;s what you do .
hi , honey . i &apos;m home .
oh , my god .
one second , madam .
this is your e.h.m. bracelet .
it &apos;s a gps @-@ enabled monitor that confines you
to a 5,000 @-@ foot radius of the base unit .
tamper with the base ,
step outside of the perimeter ,
and this light turns from green to red .
if it stays red longer than 30 seconds ,
it &apos;ll notify us that you violated house arrest .
and if that happens ?
he goes back to jail for the duration of the trial .
do you understand these conditions ?
have a good day .
ohh . oh , god . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay . you &apos;re home now .
hey . i &apos;m ready for day one .
you still picking me up ?
picking you up ?
please .
how can you even ask that , like everything &apos;s fine ,
lke you didn &apos;t just screw me over ?
what are you talking about ?
you sold me out to mason treadwell .
&quot; according to declan porter ,
precocious young charlotte grayson
was under the influence of
a mind @-@ erasing cocktail of prescription pain pills and champagne
the night of the murder . &quot;
charlotte .
&quot; porter insists there was no hooded man on the beach ,
and that the younger grayson simply invented the theory
when she realized her brother might be implicated . &quot;
you totally lied to him .
charlotte , i @-@ i know this is hard for you to hear right now ,
but i promise you that when all of this is over ,
you &apos;re gonna understand .
you know , you completely failed the collins entrance exam .
grandpa had to bribe the dean to get you in .
what are you talking about ?
you &apos;re just another puppet in the grayson family play .
and it &apos;s time for your exit .
daniel .
don &apos;t worry . it looks worse than it feels .
you are never going back to that place again .
don &apos;t be so sure .
what are you talking about ?
what &apos;s going on here ?
there &apos;s been a setback .
declan &apos;s recanted his statement
about seeing the hooded man on the beach .
well , who cares what that boy says ?
charlotte &apos;s the credible witness .
not anymore .
declan gave mason treadwell an exclusive ,
said charlotte fabricated the entire story .
our objective was to sow seeds of doubt for the jury .
but now that the treadwell story &apos;s gone viral ,
the only doubt being cast
is on the credibility of this family .
it says that she was high the night of the party .
clearly , that boy was lying .
charlotte does not do drugs .
actually , i saw charlotte with
a prescription pill bottle at the party .
why didn &apos;t you say anything ?
because i wasn &apos;t sure what i saw .
but after reading the blog , it all made sense .
if you &apos;ve seen her using ,
chances are others have , too .
i can &apos;t risk putting her on the stand .
our hooded man theory ...
has been shredded .
and with it , daniel &apos;s entire defense .
charlotte , we need to talk .
later . i &apos;m busy .
why aren &apos;t you in school ?
i &apos;m not feeling well .
don &apos;t play games with me , young lady .
mason treadwell &apos;s blog is front @-@ page news ,
and the damage is already done ,
but i want to hear it from you .
did you take pills the night of the party ?
declan lied about everything .
he saw someone on the beach , same as me .
did you or didn &apos;t you ?
no , i told you .
charlotte , look at me .
you &apos;re high right now , aren &apos;t you ?
so what if i am on drugs ?
my father &apos;s a mass murderer .
my half sister is an arsonist .
guess the fruit doesn &apos;t fall far from the tree , does it ?
victoria !
you may have just sent your brother to jail for life .
declan &apos;s schedule ,
emergency contacts , extra set of keys ,
passwords for the alarm .
i know i &apos;m forgetting something .
don &apos;t worry . i got it covered .
you all right ?
how was school ?
it was awesome . i fit right in .
you going somewhere , man ?
yeah .
yeah , we found out amanda &apos;s in montreal .
i &apos;m going after her .
you &apos;re going after her ?
what for ?
answers .
bull &apos;s gonna cover the bar .
i asked nolan to keep an eye on you while i &apos;m away .
shouldn &apos;t be long . just a few days ,
a week tops .
oh , we &apos;re gonna have so much fun .
i &apos;ll let you two work out the details .
give me a call if there &apos;s any trouble , all right ?
one for me ?
i don &apos;t think so .
oh , really ? &apos; cause you &apos;re gonna miss me most of all .
see , what he doesn &apos;t realize is ...
he thinks he &apos;s protecting you ,
but you &apos;re actually protecting him .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
dec ,
i mean your mason treadwell interview .
he hasn &apos;t read it .
you &apos;re a good brother .
yeah .
and i &apos;m a terrible boyfriend .
did you honestly think you could make your comeback
by betraying me ?
victoria , dear ,
all i did was report the truth .
once upon a time , that was the only thing i cared about .
old habits , as they say .
how callous can you be ?
you were supposed to help my son .
please , i saw right through you .
trying to frame an innocent man for the crimes of a grayson ?
my , my , history loves to repeat itself .
i , however , do not .
i &apos;m through spreading your lies .
you will do exactly as i tell you to do .
you will print a full retraction
or i swear to god , mason , i--
you &apos;ll what ,
not invite me to the parties you &apos;ve stopped throwing ,
not introduce me to the celebrities who &apos;ve stopped calling ?
your empire is crumbling , my queen .
news choppers are circling grayson manor
like so many buzzards
waiting for an old goat to die .
it &apos;s a long way up from the bottom .
surely your memory isn &apos;t that deficient .
on the contrary , it &apos;s practically photographic .
i know it was you who burned down my house .
don &apos;t bother denying it .
i found what &apos;s left of my interview tapes
in your possession .
how did you ...
they were put in my safe .
it would appear that your combination
is not as closely guarded a secret as the ... horror
that you visited upon david clarke and his daughter .
i didn &apos;t burn down your house , mason .
amanda clarke did , and her d.n.a.
is all over the site .
enough lies .
if you try to implicate that poor girl in any of this ,
i &apos;ll make sure that they burn you at the stake .
oh , you play that card ...
and you &apos;ll destroy us both .
it &apos;s a small price to pay to restore my soul .
so will daniel grayson &apos;s defense
continue to be predicated upon the idea of a hooded man ...
i &apos;m so sorry to cut you off ,
but we have no intention of litigating this in the press .
this battle will be fought in a court of law ...
can you believe these people ?
that family has got no shame .
well , they make up for it by being two @-@ faced
and morally bankrupt .
i would give anything to be a fly on the wall
in that mansion .
it &apos;s better than any reality show out there .
believe me ,
there &apos;s a lot the media don &apos;t know about them .
what , and you do ?
yeah , i do .
how ?
let &apos;s just say , i &apos;ve done some work for them .
right .
so you just come relax at this crap shack
after your polo match ?
i &apos;m dead serious .
you wouldn &apos;t believe the things i know about them .
all right .
why don &apos;t we play a game ?
i buy you a drink for every piece of bull
you make me believe .
you &apos;re on .
okay .
so what &apos;s the first thing ?
can &apos;t sleep ?
ironic , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m not in jail anymore ,
all the helicopters have gone home for the night ,
and now it &apos;s too quiet .
how &apos;s the pain ?
no worse than the fear .
the scars will heal ,
and all this will be over soon .
i promise .
i &apos;m sorry for bringing this all down on the family .
no , sweetheart .
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s sorry .
in my haste to put together a defense ...
i left out a suspect .
what are you talking about ?
doesn &apos;t it strike you as odd
that the bullets that killed tyler came from emily &apos;s gun ?
he threatened her .
and she had reason to kill him .
and to frame me for it ?
you two fought on the beach that night .
she didn &apos;t kill tyler . i shot him .
once .
you were hit in the head ,
and someone finished the job .
how do you know she wasn &apos;t there ?
you see ?
that little bit of doubt ...
is enough to get you acquitted .
no .
you bring emily into this , and i swear to god ,
i &apos;ll confess to the whole thing .
the bitch had her own son beat up
just to get him back home .
you ask me , that kid &apos;s probably safer inside .
i believe that gets me another shot .
you know , if we &apos;re gonna keep this going ,
i think we need a change of scenery .
you got a place in mind ?
yeah .
yours .
nature can be cruel .
predators are everywhere .
this is emily . leave a message .
those who don &apos;t need to be protected from outside forces
often need to be protected from themselves .
charlotte &apos;s phone . leave a message .
hello .
hey , vick . it &apos;s me .
how did you get this number ?
well , i got it from your phone last night when you were asleep .
vick , i , um ...
yes ?
i was wondering if i was ever gonna see you again .
h @-@ hello ?
am i disturbing you ?
is that a rhetorical question ?
you finally showed up this morning in last night &apos;s clothes .
i don &apos;t see how that &apos;s any business of yours .
victoria ,
i am fully aware
that our living arrangement is just for show ,
but if you &apos;re bent on having an affair--
it &apos;s not an affair if we &apos;re divorced .
that &apos;s beside the point . you need to be careful .
whatever or whomever you &apos;re doing ,
you &apos;d better damn well be discreet about it .
or you &apos;ll what ,
reveal more of our secrets ?
i know that you led treadwell to those tapes .
and all for what , your petty jealousy ?
now daniel &apos;s defense is at risk .
you &apos;ve clearly become as delusional
as you are selfish .
the fact that either of our children
find themselves in harm &apos;s way
rests squarely on your shoulders ,
not mine .
in society , women are referred to as &quot; the fairer sex ... &quot;
but in the wild ,
the female species can be far more ferocious than their male counterparts .
after you .
actually ...
before we go ...
there &apos;s something i want to give you .
oh , yeah ?
right here in the alley ?
mm @-@ hmm .
this is for jack .
who ?
defending the nest
is both our oldest and strongest instinct .
and that was for daniel .
and sometimes
