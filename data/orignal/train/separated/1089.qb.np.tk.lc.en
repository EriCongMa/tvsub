i &apos;m scared .
all i can think about is
when the next bad thing is gonna happen .
he left my apartment to go meet her .
the next day she was missing .
he was with my mother the entire night .
did he tell you that ?
you &apos;re going back to bucks county ?
i am exactly where i need to be .
i found these in his dresser .
those are mine .
i don &apos;t think byron knows we have those pages .
if you want , i can take them--
no . don &apos;t worry . i hid them .
i don &apos;t wanna see you , i don &apos;t wanna hear from you ,
and i don &apos;t wanna know you .
what is this ?
some kind of herb thing . it &apos;s meredith &apos;s cure @-@ all recipe .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s working . you look terrible .
thank you .
oh , god--
i couldn &apos;t have picked a worse time to get sick .
have you heard from your dad ?
he left a message , but i haven &apos;t talked to him
since he left for his conference .
hey . how &apos;s the patient ?
not great .
i brought over everything that helps me when i &apos;m sick .
trash ...
ginger ale ...
and three seasons of &quot; saved by the bell . &quot;
thank you , hanna .
are you sure you want to stay here by yourself ?
guys , i &apos;m fine .
you don &apos;t look fine .
so i &apos;ve heard .
you sure you don &apos;t want us to drive you to your mom &apos;s ?
no , it &apos;s her week with mike ,
so the guest room &apos;s already taken .
and besides , i promised meredith
that i wouldn &apos;t tell her about ali &apos;s diary
until we talked to my dad ,
so if i just stay away from her ,
it &apos;s easier to keep that a secret .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re trusting meredith .
i think she &apos;s really just as devastated as i am .
you &apos;re not giving her the pages , right ?
no , they &apos;re hidden in a safe place ,
and they &apos;ll stay there till my dad gets home .
then we &apos;ll give him the chance to tell us the truth .
and if he doesn &apos;t ?
i don &apos;t want to believe that my dad could have hurt ali .
but if he did do it ...
this is a family secret that i can &apos;t keep .
we &apos;re set for tomorrow .
it &apos;s too soon .
did spencer say something to you ?
she &apos;s still lying to me--
pretending &quot; a &quot; went away when they took you to radley .
that bitch can keep a secret .
i respect that .
i still feel like we &apos;re rushing this .
i told you-- i &apos;m not the one calling the shots .
fear cuts deeper than a sword .
they need to understand that she &apos;s in charge .
well , then , i &apos;ll take care of it .
today &apos;s drip . black .
thanks , em .
thank you for letting me hang .
mmm . how &apos;d they get you to open up the brew this morning ?
kinda got drafted .
i &apos;m running over to spencer &apos;s for a shower .
the plumber won &apos;t be here until nine .
great .
i &apos;ve got some reading to do .
&quot; lord of the flies . &quot; your pick or theirs ?
theirs . i don &apos;t mind .
i kind of identify with those boys .
feel like i &apos;ve been on that island . with the girls .
we did it the right way-- we stuck together no matter what .
you are thick as thieves .
we knew &quot; a &quot; was trying to tear us apart .
mona actually brought us closer together .
and we know that now . we &apos;re stronger for it .
so you actually have something to thank her for .
i wouldn &apos;t go that far .
now that she back in rosewood ,
mona &apos;s leaving you alone , right ?
she ... seems to be a model citizen .
you &apos;d tell me if things started up again ...
wouldn &apos;t you ?
of course .
i gotta get back to the flies .
oh , hey , em , could you lock up on your way out ?
sure .
hey , spence . mission accomplished .
he &apos;s on his way to your house , and i got the keys .
okay ...
which one screams &quot; young and hot &quot;
without being too trendy ?
you &apos;re asking me ?
hanna , i &apos;ve had this hoodie since i was twelve .
caleb , come on , this is important .
i have to impress corin .
it &apos;s a job interview . you &apos;re not walking the runway .
she &apos;s the hottest designer in philly .
it &apos;d be a privilege to get her a cup of coffee .
she wants you to do it in five @-@ inch heels ?
yeah , at least .
all right , go with the dress .
but just to be sure , you should probably try it on for me .
i &apos;ll be right back .
hey .
ohh . forgot my shoes .
yeah , i thought a lot about it .
i &apos;m in .
i &apos;m not gonna let her do anything else to hanna .
we &apos;ll talk this afternoon .
who were you talking to ?
um , it was my mom .
it &apos;s four @-@ thirty in california .
do you always call her this early ?
she &apos;s not in montecito . she &apos;s , um ...
in chicago , uh , for business .
so why were you talking to your mom about mona and me ?
she knows that mona bullied you ,
and she &apos;s just worried about her being back in school .
mona had someone run your mom off the road .
you shouldn &apos;t be talking about her to anyone .
hanna , mona tried to run you over when you were friends .
god only knows what she &apos;s gonna do now that you &apos;ve dumped her .
maybe she won &apos;t do anything .
of course she will . she &apos;s &quot; a. &quot;
we need to stay one step ahead of her .
look , just promise me that you won &apos;t do anything stupid .
hanna ...
promise me .
fine . i won &apos;t do anything stupid .
now let &apos;s see something hot and not @-@ too @-@ trendy .
i promise today is the last time
that they &apos;ll have to shut the water off in the loft .
i already told you , i don &apos;t really have a problem with it .
you sure you can &apos;t come over later and ...
check out the new tub ?
i hate that i can &apos;t see you tonight .
but they &apos;re honoring my dad at this dinner ,
so of course i have to be there .
i understand .
we will celebrate tomorrow .
toby .
you know that i could fix this , right ?
three years ago i made an exact replica
of mary queen of scots &apos; execution dress
for my halloween costume ,
and i didn &apos;t have a pattern .
is there anything that you can &apos;t do ?
yes . get out of this stupid dinner
that &apos;s keeping me from you on our anniversary .
uh ... i was just about to go in the other room and get dressed .
i thought i &apos;d help you decide on what to wear to the dinner
that you &apos;re so obviously agog about .
are you sure that dad &apos;ll be upset if i don &apos;t go ?
well , he has to sit through it ,
so he wants his family to sit through it , too .
misery loves company .
i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll find my way out .
toby .
you forgot your shirt .
bye .
how &apos;d i do ?
awesome . he has no clue .
i copied grandma &apos;s recipe .
oh , thank you .
what ?
i made that lasagna for your father
on our first anniversary .
toby &apos;s gonna love it .
thank you .
and thank you for my cover story .
i hope he likes surprises .
i &apos;m counting on it .
how are you feeling ?
not that great .
have i been sleeping all day ?
no , it &apos;s not quite lunchtime .
i had a break in classes , so i thought i &apos;d check in on you .
you feel really warm .
i think i need to see a doctor .
i was gonna call my mom--
my phone was just right here .
i &apos;ll look for it .
but we need to get you upstairs .
you &apos;ll sleep so much better in bed .
can you just have my mom call me ?
yeah . i &apos;ll find her as soon as i get back to the school .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll come over right away .
thank you .
i bet the stress of your dad
and those diary pages brought this on .
i can &apos;t even think about that right now .
of course not .
but you put those pages in a safe place , right ?
aria ?
rosemary chicken ? kale salad ?
what did i do to deserve this ?
i thought since you weren &apos;t up for going out ,
i &apos;d bring all your favorites to you .
so , have you given any thought to what i said the other night ?
about what ?
about seeing someone to help you with the anxiety .
actually , i did . i found someone .
and i made an appointment for this afternoon .
really ?
i figured talking to someone
who understands what i &apos;m going through can only help .
thanks for the push .
of course .
hey . sorry to interrupt .
uh , i have to borrow emily for some girl talk .
not girl @-@ on @-@ girl talk , just ... girl talk .
um , right now ?
i &apos;m really sorry . it &apos;s just important .
she &apos;s all yours .
okay .
what &apos;s up ?
i called you a couple times .
yeah . i been busy .
i need a favor from you , and i normally wouldn &apos;t ask this ,
but i have an interview today ,
aria &apos;s sick , and spencer is surprising toby--
okay , slow down .
i need you to follow caleb
after school and see where he &apos;s going .
follow him . why ?
i heard him on the phone this morning ,
and he &apos;s meeting someone . they were talking about mona .
i think he &apos;s gonna shut her down .
okay . i love you , hanna , but i &apos;m not in the c.i.a.
i don &apos;t know the first thing about tailing someone .
it &apos;s easy . you just stay far enough away so he doesn &apos;t see you ,
but not so far that you lose him .
what if he does see me ?
you lie .
you just say that you happened to be in the area .
how do you know this ?
my mom used to take me with her when we were following my dad .
when she thought that he was hooking up with isabel .
he was hooking up with isabel .
yeah . my point exactly .
look , if the roles were reversed and paige was in danger ,
you know i &apos;d do it for you .
ella . i was just coming to see you .
ah . here i am .
i stopped by to see aria on my break .
i thought you &apos;d want to know she &apos;s feeling a lot better .
oh . that &apos;s great .
i didn &apos;t want to call and wake her if she was sleeping ,
but i &apos;ll give her a call now .
um , thanks for letting me know .
of course .
and , uh , thanks for checking on her .
my pleasure . really . she &apos;s a lovely girl .
corin ?
hello ?
hello ? it &apos;s hanna marin .
hello ?
oh , my god .
help !
somebody help me !
come on .
thanks for meeting me . i &apos;m sorry you had to lie to hanna .
some lies are worth the risk .
it took me and emily so long to get to a place
where we could trust each other .
if she knew we were doing this-- same with hanna .
she would find a way to stop us .
i &apos;ve been running scared since the lighthouse ,
getting more afraid every day .
then the other night i realized
i &apos;m not afraid for me-- i &apos;m afraid for emily .
she &apos;s been dealing with this for so long ,
it &apos;s almost like she &apos;s numb to how dangerous it is .
yeah .
we know that mona has people watching their every move .
but there &apos;s no way that &apos;s she has someone
watching all of us all the time .
so while the girls are playing sitting duck ,
i &apos;m ready to circle the pond and--
nail her psychotic butt to the wall .
yeah , something like that .
before she went to radley , mona had , like ,
all the girls &apos; secrets locked
away in a motel room-- they were her trophies .
her prized possessions .
that &apos;s what she used to keep the girls from going to the cops .
so if we find her trophy room , we can put an end to this .
corin moved her store to society hill a month ago .
did you tell mona you applied for a job there ?
no , i applied months ago online .
she &apos;s just doing this to get back at me for cutting her off .
no , it wasn &apos;t her . i saw her at school around four .
then it was her minion .
is she threatening to cut your face off ?
or throw acid at her .
you guys , come on .
shall we give this key to the cops ?
there &apos;s a numerical code on it . maybe they could trace it .
even if they could trace it ,
are you ready to talk about mona 2.0 ?
that &apos;s what we would have to do if we turned it in .
for all we know ,
it &apos;s not just mona and her minion .
maybe she &apos;s built this whole &quot; a &quot; army .
we still don &apos;t know what her endgame is .
i do . it &apos;s to cut my face off .
i get it . i hear you guys ,
but she still has all those pictures of us at ali &apos;s grave .
you know what ? i don &apos;t care anymore . she has to be stopped .
you &apos;re right . but this decision is going to affect all of us .
aria has to be in on it too .
has anyone talked to her today ?
i tried her phone , but all i get is voicemail .
me too . she &apos;s probably still sleeping .
let &apos;s just wait . we &apos;ll talk about it in the morning .
i gotta get ready for tonight .
spence , have fun tonight .
we &apos;ll worry about all this tomorrow .
thanks .
if you really want to surprise toby ,
have on five @-@ inch heels and
nothing else when he walks through the door .
what ? i &apos;ve heard guys like that .
thanks for the tip .
hey , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m taking back what &apos;s mine .
is this a dream ?
no , sweetie ,
i &apos;m more real than i &apos;ve ever been .
tell me what it &apos;s like . tell me everything .
well ...
i don &apos;t know who said knowledge was king--
just an old fart , probably--
but he was right . i see everything now .
i missed so much when i was here .
do you see &quot; a &quot; ?
everywhere i turn .
so do you .
you all do .
i &apos;m surprised spencer hasn &apos;t figured that out .
did it really happen , what you wrote in those pages ?
were you blackmailing my dad ?
byron &apos;s really coming around , isn &apos;t he ?
i mean , when the chips were down with ezra &apos;s mom .
ali--
i need to know the truth .
if i tell you the truth , you don &apos;t have to believe it .
please .
i was desperate for that money .
how could you do that to my family ?
to me ?
it was just a threat .
i never called your mom .
did my dad kill you ?
do i look dead to you ?
i wouldn &apos;t drink that .
what do you mean ?
meredith is looking for these pages too .
ali , wait .
you know why i picked you , right ?
what the--
hello !
it still hurts ?
a little
kyle bown , on the boys &apos; swim team .
he can bend his wrist all the way to his arm ,
and it doesn &apos;t even hurt him . i think he &apos;s double @-@ jointed .
and you &apos;re telling me this because ?
what do you mean you can &apos;t refill it ?
you refilled this prescription last week .
yeah , i know , but i ... misplaced my pill bottle .
i &apos;m sorry , ma &apos;am . clonazepam is a class 3 medication .
you can ask your doctor to call in another prescription .
i don &apos;t have time to call my doctor . i need those pills now .
there &apos;s nothing we can do for you tonight .
we &apos;re closing in a few minutes .
great . that &apos;s just great .
ring me up .
it says clonazepam is most commonly used for anxiety ,
but some people also use it to help them sleep .
either meredith is a major insomniac
or she &apos;s trying to knock out a cow .
i do not like the idea of that woman nursing aria back to health .
i &apos;m calling her again .
straight to voicemail .
you scared me .
i &apos;m sorry . i wanted to surprise you .
you did . why aren &apos;t you at work ?
i &apos;m on a break , and since i &apos;m not gonna see you tonight ...
happy anniversary .
oh ... they &apos;re beautiful .
thank you .
i feel so bad , though . i didn &apos;t get you anything .
it &apos;s okay , i didn &apos;t expect you to .
let me go put these in water .
&quot; a &quot; ?
oh . it &apos;s not what you think .
melissa left it here . she has a storage unit in philly .
they &apos;re so pretty .
i better get back to work .
yeah . i better go get dressed for that dinner .
the sky &apos;s looking pretty dark .
maybe i &apos;ll get to come home early .
will you call me if you do ?
love you .
i love you too .
is this what you &apos;re looking for ?
quite the clever girl .
i &apos;ve searched every inch of this house , twice ,
and i can &apos;t find those pages anywhere .
have you been drugging me ?
don &apos;t be so dramatic .
i gave you something to help you sleep .
yeah , and you locked me in my room .
there &apos;s no way i &apos;m letting
you turn those pages over to the police .
it &apos;s not really your decision , is it ?
shut up and sit down !
i lied to you . my friends know about that diary .
so whatever it is that you &apos;re thinking , it &apos;s not gonna work .
what ? !
come on .
she has to be here .
aria !
aria , are you in here ?
hey . i just wanted to check in on you .
i think i &apos;m gonna make it home before the storm really hits .
well , good . i &apos;m glad you &apos;re on your way .
so how &apos;s the dinner ?
ah , it &apos;s moving along .
will you be careful ?
will do .
okay , bye .
here &apos;s the key .
aria ?
come on .
aria ?
she &apos;s not here .
i &apos;m calling her .
meredith ?
what are you girls doing out in this storm ?
where is aria ?
she went down to the basement to look for some flashlights .
she has been down there a little while .
maybe we should check on her .
aria ? are you down here ?
oh , my god , it &apos;s locked .
locked !
hang on .
okay .
hanna .
what ?
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re alone down here .
oh , my god !
aria ?
aria , are you okay ?
wake up , wake up . aria !
wake up !
aria .
it &apos;s gonna be okay , aria .
no , it &apos;s not . you guys don &apos;t get it .
she lost it . she &apos;s crazy .
what is she doing up there ?
if spencer was here she &apos;d say that she was pacing
while she plots her way to get rid of us .
she &apos;d probably be right .
there &apos;s three of us and one of her .
let &apos;s give her the pages
and then we &apos;ll take her down .
take her down ?
i have no problem opening a can of whoop @-@ ass on that woman .
it &apos;s your dad .
he--he wasn &apos;t supposed to be home till tomorrow .
she must have called him .
is he in on this ?
i don &apos;t know what i believe anymore .
meredith ?
hey , i only heard half your message .
i &apos;ve been trying to call , but the phones are out .
meredith ? what--what &apos;s wrong ?
aria knows everything .
she knows about the blackmail .
and she knows that you saw alison that night . that you--
she has proof , byron .
and her friends know , too .
what are you doing with that ?
we don &apos;t know what they &apos;re planning .
my dad would never hurt us .
aria ?
are you sure about that ?
aria ?
are you okay ?
you don &apos;t need to be afraid of me .
i swear . i--
i didn &apos;t hurt alison .
i didn &apos;t bring any money .
then we both know how this is gonna end .
you know how much it &apos;ll hurt aria if you make that call .
and i don &apos;t think you &apos;re that horrible of a person .
then you clearly don &apos;t know me that well .
last chance to save yourself .
yes , it is .
you made your bed , mr. montgomery !
what do i have to do , call 911 to get your attention ?
i was prepared to tell your mom the truth .
then alison went missing .
and the longer she stayed missing ,
the harder it became for me to tell anyone .
is this what you &apos;re looking for ?
spencer .
how long have you known ?
spencer ?
hi , honey .
is everything okay ?
what is it , honey ?
mommy !
i @-@ i called the police , and they checked meredith &apos;s apartment .
she &apos;s gone .
you told us about the affair . why didn &apos;t you tell us about this ?
when they found alison &apos;s body ,
it was clear that she had been murdered ,
and there were no suspects .
i saw her the night she died , and i knew how that would look .
you mean how it does look .
what started this ? how did you find out ?
we found an old diary of ali &apos;s .
she wrote about you .
why didn &apos;t-- why didn &apos;t you come and talk to me ?
i wanted to .
but meredith made me believe that you actually--
i was scared .
aria , i need to know if there &apos;s any part of you
that still thinks that i could have done this .
i understand .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m gonna do something i should have done a long time ago .
i &apos;m gonna tell the police everything .
and hopefully after whatever investigation they do
you will realize that i had nothing to do with alison &apos;s death .
what are you doing ?
i believe you .
i know you &apos;re in there .
will you ...
will you just tell me that what i saw tonight wasn &apos;t real ?
please !
just tell me that there &apos;s more to this story ...
that there &apos;s something that i don &apos;t know .
please . please , toby ...
please , toby .
