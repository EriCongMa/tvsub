Entropy
You're part of an interconnected group of hitmen working together online.
How many of them are you?
Besides me, quatro.
The last time we talked,
you hinted that this was your next target--
The Dirty Dozen. Who are they?
You're the Dirty Dozen?
But if they're as good as I think they are,
no one can stop them.
Director Cochran, do you mind if we borrow your pen?
Something tells me the access codes
to the darknet servers are in there.
I'm scared. What's going on?
There's been a major break in the case
of the hitmen hunting you.
There has?
And we may have found a way
to bring The whole network down.
Hi. Table for two for Spencer.
Here you are.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Spencer?
Cat?
Hi!
Hi.
Hi.
Hello. Hi.
Nice to finally--
Oh--sorry, I have a-- a germ thing.
I'm kind of weird with hu-hugs.
Sorry.
Can I sit down?
Yes, please. Oh, yeah. Of course.
Sit down.
First time doing this?
Yeah. I mean, yeah.
Yeah, I--I still get nervous, too.
Really, it wasn't until an hour ago that I was like,
wait, we've been trading emails back and forth,
but I still have no idea what this guy looks like.
Hence the...
I know. And then I was like, wait,
he's going to bring a red rose,
so we need to go to a nicer place,
which is why I switched the restaurant last-minute--
Not a problem at all.
And now I need to change and put something nice on
for this place, 'cause I was totally underdressed,
and my whole wardrobe makes me look like a Kardashian.
You don't know who that is, do you?
No, oh, yeah, Robert Kardashian.
He got O.J. Simpson off.
You--you don't look like his daughters.
Yeah, no, I was making a joke about them.
No, it was good. It was a good joke.
No, it wasn't.
It was funny.
Can we start over? Hi, I'm cat.
Hi--hi, I'm -- I'm Spencer.
It really is nice to meet you,
in person, finally.
It's nice to meet you.
Tell me a little bit about yourself.
Do you really have 3 Ph.Ds?
Yes. Um, I--yeah, I do, I have 3 I have 3 Ph.Ds.
What was your favorite book that you read last year?
Um, honestly, I've never read a book I didn't love.
Tell me about your wife.
If you don't mind, I'd, uh,
I'd rather not talk about her.
Might as well get it out in the open, right?
That's why we're here.
How long have you been married?
4 years.
When is she due to give birth?
A couple of--
a couple of months.
Should we talk about price now, or...
Slow down, tiger. What exactly are we negotiating here?
You know.
I want to hear you say it.
To have her killed.
Let me see your ring.
You know what that is?
A noose.
Only it doesn't kill you all at once.
It kills you slowly,
day by day.
You ever feel that way?
I feel that way all the time.
Take it off.
Why?
As a sign of your commitment.
To me.
If she sticks to pattern,
she'll take him to a secondary location and kill him.
We're not gonna let it get that far.
Hotch, do you have a visual?
Just hacked in.
All right, we have you over her left shoulder.
Do you copy?
All right, all agents stand by.
Dr. Reid will give the green light.
Don't move until we have it.
24-karat?
24k times... 4 years
means this ring should be dinged and nicked.
But the sucker is brand-new.
You're not married.
What was that? Was that what I think it was?
Everybody hold.
Why are we here, Spencer?
We're here because you belong to a network of 4 hitmen
who've been operating in the shadows of the internet.
You're know as Miss 45.
My team and I have been hunting for months,
and I knew that if I boxed you in,
I could arrest you with as little resistance as possible.
Your team being the Behavioral Analysis Unit of the FBI?
You guys are good. You're the only ones that got close to us.
But we got kind of close to you, too, didn't we?
Hi, Penelope.
Do you know why I'm so good at my job?
Because you kill without compunction or remorse.
That only gets a girl so far in life.
No, it's because I think through every potential outcome
and then I plan accordingly.
You see, I didn't walk into your trap.
You walked into mine.
Where's your head, Spencer?
What are you thinking about?
I was thinking about entropy.
It's the thermodynamic measure of the degradation
of matter and energy in the universe.
To put it another way--
There's your gun.
Good evening.
Hi, uh, you know what?
We've been having so much fun getting to know one another,
we'll let you know when we're ready, ok? Thank you.
Now that we got that out of the way,
will you do me a favor and tell blondie Mcblonderson
over there at the bar to disappear.
JJ, stand down.
Thanks for playing, sweetie.
If she learns how many agents we have outside,
she'll start shooting.
Dave, get ready to take her out.
Yeah.
Reid, do not let her get up from the table.
All right, you're in charge.
Tell me what you want and I'll see if I can get it here for you.
Anything I want?
Anything you want.
Like a million dollars in unmarked bills,
maybe a plane to Aruba?
Is that what you want?
And you'll say you'll bring it here,
but the real plan is to distract me
from what is, I'm sure,
an impressive law enforcement response
just outside that door. Is that the plan?
That's the plan.
Ok, let's talk,
but let's talk about something interesting, at least.
Tell me about me.
You?
You're a black widow hitwoman.
You specialize in seduction and you're patient.
You learn everything you can
about the men you're hired to kill,
physically, psychologically, and emotionally,
because you want them
in as compromised a position as possible
so they don't see it coming when you pull the trigger.
And when I do it really well,
they pull the trigger themselves.
Give me your phone.
Why?
Because I know what I want now.
I want to play a game with you.
You like games?
I do.
Do you win?
I always win.
Give it to me.
Ok, here's my game.
You have 30 minutes to answer every question I ask.
And if you lie, I'll know.
Because I've spent the past 10 years of my life
studying men and their lies
before I kill them.
Do you believe me?
I do.
That was true. You're getting this.
Now, here's how we'll know who wins at the end of 30 minutes.
If you win, you'll drag me out of here in handcuffs.
But if I win, you will escort me out
like a gentleman,
to make sure I exit safely.
What do you say, Spencer?
Think you can win this one?
Considering everything you've put Garcia
and so many people through,
you're going to have to shoot me in the face
before you walk out of here.
Game on.
Oh, boy.
What do you want to ask me?
How you found me, of course.
A professional learns from her mistakes.
We got our big break in the case at the end of last year.
I didn't learn how big until I came back from some time off.
Why'd you take time off?
Higher, mommy, higher!
Careful, sweetheart.
Higher, mommy, higher!
Hey, you!
Hi.
Welcome back. Come in.
Thank you.
I know you're not a hugger. I don't care.
Hey, get your greasy hands off my girl.
Nice to have you home, kid.
Good to be back.
Let me get my stuff.
That thing you called about, here's some updated stats.
Thanks.
Stats?
Stats from what?
Medical research. Shop talk.
Things you wouldn't be interested in.
Well, I can tell you what I am interested in,
and that is you.
You gonna love me forever?
Yes, I am.
Forever ever?
For ever, ever, ever.
Guys. Garcia and Hotch need us ASAP
for a briefing on the 4 hitmen.
Stop.
What?
You didn't tell me why you took time off.
It's not relevant.
That's not the game.
The game is you answer every question I ask.
Is it a secret?
No.
Is it dirty?
No.
Then tell me.
It's not important to your story.
Out of curiosity, is it me you don't want to tell
or the people listening in?
Is this really how you want to spend your 30 minutes?
Yes.
No.
Ok, so you were saying
you showed up for work that morning and...
We learned that someone unexpected decided to talk.
And who would that be?
Brian Cochran from the NSA.
I've placed him on 24/7 lockdown at USP Terre Haute.
The network has proven
that they can kill anyone, anywhere, anytime,
And now that they've targeted Garcia,
We can't afford to lose another lead.
Cochran used one of the hitmen to target DEA supervisor Graff.
But we can press him on that to get him to cooperate.
Well, fortunately that won't be necessary.
He had a breakdown in solitary confinement
and he was already willing to make a deal.
We need to go talk to him.
Garcia and I already did.
This is, we video-conferenced with him.
He was limited in what he could tell us about the hit people.
He didn't know their names,
but he did know all of their areas of expertise.
How specific do they get?
Most successful hitmen are basically
just swiss army knives of murder.
Well, take the O.G. hit guy who got us into this mess,
Giuseppe Montolo. Remember him?
He was a genius at making hits look like an accident.
The others, depends what you're looking for.
Take the guy that's still out there
who's responsible for shooting poor Mr. Graff.
He's known simply as the sniper.
He can make a T-zone shot from over 2,000 meters.
Which means he's ex-military.
Not necessarily ours, but he's definitely trained.
So who's number two?
That would be the Chemist.
He works with poison.
He specializes in hits that don't leave a trace.
He sounds delightful.
What about number 3?
Well, that would be the Bomber.
According to Cochran, he's responsible for this.
It's a chemical fire in Tianjin, China.
Apparently a bureaucrat didn't pay his bribe on time.
You know that's conspiracy theory garbage.
But what is credible is Cochran's insistence
that he was trained by Mossad.
Jack Garrett's following up on leads.
That leaves us with number 4,
The one with the highest body count of them all.
And who's that?
Me.
Yes.
Wow, that was really impressive.
Yeah, the way you just made all those brilliant deductions
with all that information
that was just handed to you on a silver platter.
Quick question--are you guys really profilers
or are you just lucky?
Because this, what I'm about to say--
is profiling.
The reason you took time off from work
was to deal with the same girl who broke your heart.
No.
The death of a parent, then.
No.
Ah, hello, I'm getting close.
It's mom or dad in the billiard room with the candlestick.
Oh, you're mad at me, aren't you?
Not even a little bit.
Yes, you are, I can tell.
No offense, but you're not really worth getting angry at.
So you figured out what the 4 of us did, and then what?
We profiled that you operated as spokes on a wheel.
Somehow it had to be centralized,
how you got jobs, who paid you.
Somebody did all that for you.
You found the Snowman, didn't you?
Great. So who's this Snowman jagoff?
Cochran says he's the I.T. expert.
He's the key to the whole network.
But if he set it up,
he's not just gonna tear it down because we ask nicely.
He will because he was kidnapped by one of the hitmen
and held against his will in a safe house.
I wonder how that feels.
Even if they have him under duress,
he's still gonna be impossible to find.
We will find him...
With this.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm confused. What just happened there?
When we arrested Cochran, we found a flash drive,
One that gave us access to a specific shadow of the darknet,
one we didn't even know existed.
Oh, put a ring on it before you decide to do that.
Oh, that's flashy. It's certainly cocky.
Yeah, it's smart, but it's risky.
He's taking security flaws from his own code
and then exploiting them as another level of security.
If I didn't know any better, I'd think he was having fun.
He wouldn't do this if his life depended on it, unless...
He's young.
Yeah, and based on this, like high school young.
Garcia used it to find the website
that Snowman set up for all of you.
Once we had the website, we had geography,
specifically, the safe house you were keeping him in.
So we waited until the shift change
when we knew we could take two of you down at once.
FBI! Everybody down!
FBI!
Don't!
It's ok. We got you.
What is this? What's going on?
Welcome to the FBI, kid.
Well, well, well, you took the Chemist and the Sniper
out of commission, huh?
Did you know?
I knew something was off.
They didn't bid on some contracts.
And this isn't the kind of job
where you get to take time off to be with your...
Mother?
Is it your mom? It's gotta be your mom.
Why'd you take time off from the FBI?
I'm not gonna tell you.
Spencer, why did you take time off
from the FBI?
You can ask me as many times as you want,
and you can continue to waste your time,
but I'm still not gonna tell you.
Then you're cheating, and I don't like cheaters.
You don't get everything you want just because
you're pointing a gun at me under a table.
You're not the first killer to point a gun at me.
You're not even the first woman to point a gun at me.
Sorry.
You're really gonna take this all the way, aren't you?
Yeah.
So am I.
Dave, go.
Look at my face. Does it look like I'm bluffing?
I know you're not bluffing.
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Before you say no, I want you to consider something.
She muffled the mike. We lost audio.
I'll kill the fed walking toward me first.
A stationary target's easier to hit.
After that it's a free-fire zone.
Fine, I'll tell you.
Sorry, what was that?
I'll tell you.
Rossi, stand down.
Please.
Welcome to the locker room.
I hate the locker room.
My mom has schizophrenia,
and the doctor has changed her medication,
which seemed to agitate her,
and so I went to the treatment center to help her.
That's it?
That's it.
You just risked your life over mommy's pills?
It's the truth.
It's part of the truth.
You're holding something back.
Here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna penalize you by adding 10 minutes.
And keep in mind that the only reason you're not dead right now
is because I did learn something important.
Oh, really? What's that?
Your backup. I flushed them out.
It's just you and me now.
Guess again, bitch.
So when we left off, the score was you had two of our guys
and the Snowman.
You must have thought you were home free.
No. If anything, the case was harder.
I can't tell you much about them.
It's not like we had a lot of heart-to-heart conversations
while they handcuffed me to a computer.
Do you know any of their names?
No. But I know their bank accounts.
How long do you think we have
before the other two realize the network's been compromised?
Two days, maybe.
They like being independent contractors,
so they always work jobs separately.
And, uh, they rely on me to coordinate all their online traffic.
Which I can help fake.
Yeah.
We have the facade covered on our end,
but they also have back channel communications
that I can't account for.
Especially the Bomber.
Why him?
I don't know.
All I know is when they would rotate watching over me,
he never showed.
I know why. He's paranoid.
Most explosive experts are.
Blow everything up,
you live in fear that you're next.
We need to lure out the hitwoman.
If we can take her alive, she'll lead us to the Bomber.
We have to give her a target worth coming out of hiding for.
That means me, doesn't it?
No.
Sir.
Garcia, that's not gonna happen.
It's too dangerous to leave you out there exposed like that.
You have a record of all the kills she was paid for?
I have records of everything.
All right. Even a contract killer can have a victimology,
a pattern of which she's not aware.
We need to find that.
But first we had to get the data that we needed from the Snowman.
From that we could start to
build the profile that would lead us to you.
When we knew what we were looking for, the pattern was obvious.
These 3 hits-- they were all men who wanted to kill their wives.
That's the oldest motivation in the book.
Why are they special?
She took their money, then killed the men who hired her.
All 3 of them had children.
Maybe children are the line hitmen won't cross?
The Chemist and the Sniper
both performed jobs that involved families.
Theoretically, if the price is high enough,
a hitman shouldn't have morals.
I think these kills are personal to her.
Personal enough to risk double-crossing her contract.
Maybe something similar happened to her.
And that's how we get her to come to the table.
I pretend to be that kind of client.
How do we know that's gonna work?
We don't. It's a calculated risk
based on her M.O., which is categorically different than the men.
They're cold, clinical, long-distance.
She's up close and personal.
She knows that she has to be more careful
because she actually wants to kill her targets.
I'm going to pretend to be a husband
who wants his pregnant wife dead.
Well, I'd want to kill you if you told me that.
Exactly. Then all we have to do is set the right meeting spot.
A bar or a restaurant we control
so the odds are better of us taking her alive.
That's our best strategy.
But there is one flaw.
You. You're the flaw.
You're not married and you don't have children.
I'm the person on my team who's the closest to your age,
and I knew that if I lost control of the situation,
you'd be more likely to negotiate with a peer.
You have zero control here. None.
I outflanked you from the beginning.
Some of your moves were pretty obvious.
Such as?
Such as showing up armed.
Such as changing the venue at the last moment.
I needed a restaurant full of innocents in case this was a trap.
If you really suspected this was a trap,
then why show up at all?
Even when you first laid eyes on me,
from the bar, from outside, from wherever you were,
you should have seen through me
and kept on moving, but you didn't.
You couldn't.
Because you can't get to the man
you really want to hurt,
so you need to hurt any man who reminds you of him.
That's kind of boilerplate psychology, isn't it?
I'm just another girl with daddy issues.
You'd be surprised how many killers
do what they do because of their parents.
If it's so boilerplate, why don't we test that theory?
How hard did you look for him?
Very hard.
And how disappointed were you when you realized that
you will never find him?
You needed some other outlet for your rage,
and for a while this worked, but it also tripped you up.
Can I tell you a little secret?
Everything eventually falls apart.
The trick is accepting when it's over.
Except it ain't over, is it?
Do you really think I'm just gonna let you walk out of here?
You profiled so much about me,
except you forgot to ask the most important question.
Why would I make you sit here for 30 minutes?
Because you're stalling.
Then you don't know me at all.
Do you think I'd show up here without an escape plan?
Or is that what just another girl with daddy issues do?
Maybe if you hadn't fallen victim to your own gender bias,
and, yes, all men have gender bias,
even you, Dr. Reid,
you would have recognized that your entire strategy
was based on one faulty detail.
Can you see it?
They like being independent contractors,
so they always worked jobs separately.
You're not here alone.
And my partner? Less paranoid than you think.
You planted a bomb in the building.
We're on the move.
I didn't. My job was to keep your entire team focused on us,
so he could do what he does best.
Hotch, we've got interconnected C-4 charges down here.
How many?
There's 6 charges. They're connected to the city's gas line.
She could take out the whole block.
There are innocent people here.
Yes, there are.
So let me remind you what we're playing for.
Not only will I walk out of here,
but you will make sure I leave safely.
And from where I'm sitting...
It looks like I've won.
You need to pay attention to this part.
I'm going to tell you the terms of my victory.
I want you to move all of your backup away from this building.
If I walk out of here and I see one cop,
I will incinerate us all.
I can't do that.
Spencer.
It's not me. What you're asking takes time.
This is to whoever's in charge.
造成邪教内包括20名儿童与2名孕妇在内的76人死亡
Unless you guys want to be responsible
FBI承受了巨大压力与声誉风险
for the biggest FBI disaster since Waco,
you will back off now.
Watch this.
JJ, say again. The bomb has a cell phone trigger?
That's right. All she has to do is call the number and boom.
Can you jam the signal?
Not from here, no.
The failsafe will still kick in.
Same outcome-- can't move 'em, can't submerge 'em.
It'll take us hours to get the gas turned off on the whole block.
If we alert anyone,
then the panic could set her and the bomb off.
Swat's on the radio with the bomb squad.
They say our only chance is to get our hands on that cell phone.
If we shut down the trigger, we can remove the charges.
Morgan.
Go ahead, Hotch.
Does she have a cell phone with her?
I don't think so. I didn't see her pull one out.
The Bomber was setting this up while we were all up here.
I think he's holding the stick.
We're combing the block. He could be anywhere, though.
Where's Lewis?
Do not overreact.
Do not rush.
Simply give every patron their check
and tell them there's been an unforeseen problem in the kitchen
that cannot be resolved.
Their dinner has been paid for
and they should leave calmly
and at their earliest possible convenience.
Got it?
Yes, ma'am.
Great.
You. Come with me.
That table there,
you leave alone.
Look at that. There they go.
All we want to do--
minimize the collateral damage. I get it.
I'm not mad. It'll give me the cover I need to slip out.
I just need to know it's clear,
so do me a favor and tell your boss
that nobody leaves until it's safe for me to.
Reid, perimeter agents are pulling back.
You have to let her go.
Well?
Repeat--all agents, do not engage or pursue
until the bomb is defused.
Spencer...
You can leave.
But you won't.
I'm sorry?
Double or nothing. You need to sit back down.
Reid, what are you doing?
Wow, now you're stalling.
You played your trump card, but I have one, too.
Thanks for dinner.
I had fun.
I found your father.
No, you didn't.
Look at my face. Am I bluffing?
I'll tell you where he is.
But you need to sit back down
and listen to the rest of my story.
No. Tell me now.
Or I'll--
Detonate the bomb?
You're not gonna do that, Cat,
because then you won't learn anything.
You said you were good at your job
because you think through every outcome.
Well, guess what-- so do I.
All right.
Finish the story.
To prepare for this dinner, I had to learn everything about you,
starting with your real name.
Foster care records locked, loaded, and searchable.
According to the emails she sent me setting up tonight,
her name is Cat. So let's assume her name is Catherine.
Give me more.
Suspicious death for mom,
and her dad most likely went away for manslaughter.
Keep it coming.
Rampant abuse.
She would have been in a world of pain.
Sadly that does not rule out any Catherines.
Her first kills were most likely in the foster environment.
Cross-reference all those families
the Catherines went into with accidental deaths
of foster dads, and focus on those
that have multiple abuse complaints leveled against them.
Ding.
Catherine Adams.
Daughter of Daniel Adams,
who did in fact leave the country in 1987
but returned in 2012.
Based on confidential records in rehabs and sober living houses,
which in turned pointed us to flophouses and soup kitchens.
He couldn't put 24 hours together sober.
And you can probably imagine my surprise
when I discovered that he actually
lives right here in D.C.
Where?
It's not that simple.
He was in bad shape when I found him.
Is your name Daniel Adams?
Who wants to know?
My name is Spencer Reid. I'm with the FBI
and I'd love to ask you a few questions.
Leave me alone.
I'm just trying to sleep.
Mr. Adams, I just need to ask you a few questions
about your daughter.
Who?
Your daughter, Catherine.
You don't recognize her, do you?
I think you got the wrong man, pal.
He didn't remember me?
The alcoholism shredded his brain.
I'm sorry.
You're not sorry.
Sorry is what people say when they don't understand.
Wait.
Your mother... tell me.
Is-is this part of the game?
No. The game's over.
When I looked at her medical chart,
it-it didn't make any sense.
The medication that they gave her
should have been helping,
But I couldn't figure out what was making her so angry.
So, I, uh,
I went to see her.
The moment I walked in her room,
I saw it.
For 3 seconds...
She didn't know who I was.
I, um, I had her tested that morning,
and I found out that night...
That she had early onset of dementia.
Most likely Alzheimer's.
Did you test yourself?
No, you didn't.
You were too scared.
Did you know?
No.
I thought I dodged a bullet when I turned 30
and didn't have a schizophrenic break like her,
But, uh, this is somehow bigger and scarier
because I can actually see it happening.
All the memories that we used to share
are just dying.
I can't stop it.
I can't help her.
All I can do
is find people that I can help.
Is that really why you showed up tonight?
To help me?
Do you know how many men have told me
that they wanted to help me?
How do you think that worked out for them?
Hotch, she just armed the bomb.
Hotch, we need to pull back.
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
Morgan, get out of there.
Hotch, we might have a lead here.
She hasn't touched anything to arm the bomb.
That means the Bomber's here, somewhere in the restaurant.
All right, if you can take him,
do so, but the priority is evacuation.
I'm not even sure if it is a him.
Cat mentioned something about gender bias,
so that could apply to the Bomber as well.
All right, she'd have to be in a position to maintain
line of sight on Reid all night. Who do you see?
Look for anyone with their phone out.
That's the detonator.
Our woman will give herself away by looking over.
You're right. You don't need my help.
You don't need anyone's help.
You are completely in control.
I've got her.
Blue dress. By the bar.
Hey, you know what, baby?
Let's get out of here.
I'm not really feeling this place.
Really? I kind of liked it.
I want to take you to a spot where we can do some dancing.
Hotch, we're clear.
Reid's not.
Don't!
FBI. Everybody stay calm, please.
We're gonna be smart about this
and talk it out.
Aren't we, Cat?
That's up to you.
Get everyone out of here.
Move.
Morgan, you, too.
I'm not going anywhere.
Guess we're right back where we started.
You and me with a gun.
Reid, it's time.
No.
We don't have a choice. We have to do it.
Do what?
Morgan, shut up.
There's one thing he hasn't told you yet.
That's not true. He's lying. Don't listen to him.
What haven't you told me?
Nothing. I told you... Nothing!
What don't I know?
Nothing!
We brought your father here.
Here?
He's here?
He's right outside.
Reid thought he needed
every bargaining chip he could get.
Morgan, I'm begging you, don't. Don't.
Every bargaining chip he could get to convince you
to do the right thing.
How is this the right thing?
Your father killed your mother.
And there's no statute of limitations on murder,
so you really need to think about your options right now.
You shoot him, I will kill you.
Or if you surrender, you will live
to testify against your father.
That's not good enough.
We can arrange it for the two of you
to drive into custody together,
and then you can remind him of who you are.
If you give her this, she wins. Don't do it.
Kid, I am trying to save your life.
Now let me do that.
They're bringing him in right now.
You're really upset about this, aren't you?
This is what you wanted, isn't it,
a chance to finally hurt the man who deserves it?
They all deserve it.
He deserves it the most.
Only if Spencer escorts me out.
Deal.
Hotch?
Yeah.
We're coming out.
Ok, you're all clear.
You want to go home?
Wait.
Ok, I'm ready.
You lied to me.
If it makes you feel any better, I really-- I did look for him.
But... I couldn't find him, so, yeah,
I did make it all up.
Not all of it.
You don't pull a story about a parent
losing her memory out of nowhere.
Your mother and the Alzheimer's, that's true.
I won.
How so?
Because I will get out of here.
Yeah, in 20 years, maybe, if you're lucky.
Yeah, that's fine. You know why?
Because in 20 years...
I'll remember your name,
but you won't remember mine.
You want to come in,
decompress a bit?
I'm good. I'm probably just gonna go home.
That was an intense case.
Yeah.
It's over.
Network's gone.
Yeah.
Reid.
That medical research that Savannah gave you,
was that...
Yeah.
You are gonna get yourself tested, aren't you?
One of the data points that her research told me about was age.
I'm, uh, too young to display the chromosomal signs,
so I'm just gonna have to...
Learn to live not knowing.
Oh, my God.
What is happening right now?
You're what's going on. Right now is what's--
You are here. Do you know what's happening right now?
It is... it is done. The Dirty Dozen is done.
Yes, done. I'm in it!
It's...
How much did she have?
She started out with Jaeger.
Jaeger?
I love you.
Ok.
I love you.
And you-- I love you so much.
And you, I should be jealous of you
because you're so hot. But I'm not.
I'm not. I promise you I'm not. I'm not. I promise.
No, I'm not. 'cause you know what?
All I feel in here is love. I just--
I am feeling-- I'm full of love.
So much love. I'm wearing too many clothes.
Uh, I got this.
You sure you don't want to reconsider?
I think I'm ok. I'm just gonna--
I really just want to go home.
Hey, kid.
Can I tell you something?
Yeah.
I just, uh...
Yeah.
You know?
I know.
I know.
Good.
Because I mean it.
I'll see you tomorrow.
