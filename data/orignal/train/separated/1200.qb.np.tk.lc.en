did you actually read any of his book ?
ezra knew who i was before we met .
he knew who all of us were .
do you always carry that much cash around ?
who is the money for ?
the money is for ali . she &apos;s alive .

how did it go ?
that cop , holbrook , spoke up for my dad .
i was surprised to hear that you spoke for mr. hobbs .
thank you .
okay , stop . what are you up to ?
your mother and i spoke with dr. griggs this morning .
he recommended a rehab facility in philly .
ezra is moving forward with the book .
he is meeting with his agent in new york right now
discussing a release date .
now i know that everything he says
or has ever said is a lie .
are you going somewhere ?
that &apos;s the plan . i got to get out of here .
it &apos;s a simple question , okay .
did you or did you not see me standing
with a shovel that night ?
and if you did see me hurt ali ,
then why didn &apos;t you just call the cops ?
anything for the dry cleaners ?
it was 3 days in rehab , mom .
i really did not need so many sweaters .
i thought , i don &apos;t know , maybe you &apos;d go outside
for some fresh air or if you got cold .
i did get cold and then i got the sweats .
you know , withdrawal symptoms
can &apos;t really be stopped with a cable knit .
they said that the medical detox
would help mitigate your discomfort .
it did , mom .
i was so comfortable kicking my drug habit .
sorry .
i &apos;m very irritable .
they said to expect irritability over the next few days .
as long as you &apos;re home and well , i can handle it .
don &apos;t you walk away from me .
is there anything you need ?
there &apos;s left @-@ over carbonara
or i can make a salad if you &apos;d like something lighter .
you &apos;re way out of your league , spencer .
you sure about that ?
put that thing down before you hurt yourself .
spencer ?
i said you look tired .
maybe you should get some rest .
we have some things to discuss in the morning .
mom ? have you seen my car keys ?
i want to get to school early and catch up on
any assignments that i might have missed .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry to interrupt .
honey , this is dean stavros .
he &apos;s going to be staying with us for a while .
sweetheart , you &apos;re not going back to school just yet .
we &apos;ve already taken your car keys .
i &apos;ll need your cellphone and your laptop as well .
but why ?
there will be no phone calls of any kind ,
no internet , no friends .
we &apos;ll be sure to get your assignments from school .
and how do you expect me to turn them in ?
carrier pigeon ?
you &apos;ll earn your privileges back over time ,
as long as you follow dean &apos;s program .
the doctor said that i was fine to go back to school ,
as long as i agreed to outpatient counseling .
could you please excuse us ?
i need to talk to my mom .
actually , i don &apos;t think i can .
spencer , i &apos;m a drug and alcohol abuse counselor .
your parents brought me here to help you .
i &apos;m gonna be camped out in the barn , on @-@ call 24 / 7--
so you &apos;re basically a baby @-@ sitter .
do you and dad distrust me this much ?
quite frankly , given this latest episode , yes .
i understand you may be feeling a little ambushed .
excuse me .
how long am i supposed to stay under guard ?
i have to apologize for my daughter .
oh , as long as you &apos;re handing them out ,
i would love an apology from you .
your father and i thought the first time
would be the last .
since you &apos;ve relapsed--
i would hardly call this a relapse .
spencer , look , i bet your mom would be
a whole lot more open to hearing you out
if you hand over your electronics .
show her you &apos;re willing to cooperate .
can i please just call toby ?
i tried him last night and he hasn &apos;t called me back yet .
i &apos;ve had a conversation with toby
and he understands that you &apos;ll be hard
to reach for the time being .
it will give us all a chance to focus .
great .
where do we start ?
fantastic .
i will go upstairs and fill this with my dignity .
i &apos;m still at syracuse .
does your dad know what happened ?
no . no .
he thinks i &apos;m here for a prospective student week .
it &apos;s 4 days of campus tours , classroom visits ,
and a bunch of father @-@ daughter bonding time .
how are you doing ? really .
um , honestly , i &apos;m just trying not to think about any of it .
him . everything .
you don &apos;t have to go through this on your own .
you know , we can all come up there .
no , it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m not alone .
i just mean that my dad &apos;s here with me .
look , i &apos;ve got to go .
the tour &apos;s starting . bye .
morning , sunshine .
no , don &apos;t start . you look worse than me .
no . i don &apos;t .
you ready to learn about the history
of this illustrious institution ?
i &apos;m ready for some sleep or coffee .
i don &apos;t know , an aspirin .
yeah , my student host didn &apos;t exactly
offer continental breakfast .
okay , everyone , over here for the tour please .
we--we really need to go on this thing ?
i know a place nearby .
killer pancakes .
you mean bail on the tour ?
only if you want .
i want .
all right .
give those back . i need them .
this way , over here .
aria finally called me this morning .
is she still mad at me ?
she &apos;s not mad , she &apos;s hurting .
but she sounded okay .
distant .
are we still going to spencer &apos;s later ?
it was so weird .
i called her cell and her mom answered .
there &apos;s no visitors
and she &apos;s not gonna be in school for a while .
probably for the best .
i saw fitz &apos;s car in the teacher &apos;s parking lot .
wait , he &apos;s back ?
so he just goes to new york to collect
the big , fat check for selling us out .
and then what , comes back here to gloat ?
i wish you would have told me this before i bought tickets .
do you want to go at all ?
i &apos;m sorry , mike . i don &apos;t know what to say .
give me a call when you figure it out .
looks like he &apos;s still pulling mona &apos;s strings .
do you think fitz was behind whatever that was ?
i mean , mike and mona didn &apos;t really make much sense unless ...
unless she was spying on aria for him .
now i &apos;m mad . we should say something .
are you coming ?
i can &apos;t .
if you &apos;re gonna slash his tires or bust his headlights ,
i &apos;d still be down .
but i don &apos;t want to be in the same room with him .
i know . i get it .
hey , i &apos;m gonna ditch last period .
are you gonna be okay ?
yeah , i &apos;ll be fine .
emily , class doesn &apos;t start for another few minutes .
okay , i don &apos;t know how much you know
but as close as you are to aria ,
i can assume that you know everything .
i really want to talk to you about this , emily ,
but i would really prefer
if it were outside of a classroom .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to happen .
i &apos;ve already talked to you outside of the classroom .
i let you help me with my college essays .
you tutored me .
you helped me when i lost my girlfriend .
why did you do all of that ?
what did you get out of it ?
there &apos;s an assignment due today ,
but i won &apos;t be staying for the class .
will you make sure a real teacher gets this ?
don &apos;t get up .
i don &apos;t want to accidentally run into your mouth again .
is that what that was ?
look , it wasn &apos;t supposed to happen .
and it &apos;s not going to ever again .
i promise .
i &apos;m sure travis will be glad to hear that .
after court , when i passed the two of you talking ,
it seemed like there was a look .
do you have a minute to sit ?
you know , i actually just came to apologize .
i just-- i thought it would be weird
if i saw you and i didn &apos;t say anything .
is there anything else you want to talk about ?
no . i &apos;m good .
well , there &apos;s a couple of things i &apos;d like to ask you .
please sit .
what do you know about this ?
i &apos;ve never seen this before .
you recognize the handwriting ?
why don &apos;t you open it up , read the note inside ?
it might look familiar .
ad公司 邮政信箱537 宾州 瓦林福德镇
what is this ?
i was hoping you could tell me .
i didn &apos;t write it , if that &apos;s what you &apos;re asking .
i thought it was a possibility .
ok . i wouldn &apos;t be doing my job if i didn &apos;t ask .
well , you don &apos;t think that &apos;s real , do you ?
i mean you &apos;re not going to go
looking for alison now , are you ?
no , don &apos;t worry .
we get stuff like that all the time .
it &apos;s probably just another crackpot .
i have to go meet my mom for dinner .
it &apos;s a little early for that , don &apos;t you think ?
it &apos;s my turn to cook .
that &apos;s good . no , keep playing .
no , i just- i just wanted to give antonio a little air .
oh , you named your guitar antonio ?
i like to think antonio named himself .
you slept well ?
um , yeah , a little bit .
i still feel like my head &apos;s a bowling ball ,
but i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna yak on my shoes anymore .
hey , that &apos;s progress .
you don &apos;t normally drink , do you ?
this week &apos;s anything but normal .
why is that ?
oh , we missed the last tour , huh ?
we can learn about the hall of languages
and the billion dollar endowment another day .
so your dad ... i thought you were staying with your dad .
i am . yeah , he &apos;s- he &apos;s just right next door .
so what does he profess ?
art history .
you into art , too ?
a little .
um , i like to write ,
but who knows now .
what- what are you looking for ?
hair of the dog .
that &apos;s supposed to cure hangover , right ?
god , we totally raided this thing .
who drank the pineapple rum ?
guilty .
how much do you think all this stuff cost ?
no , not too much a lot .
maybe a couple of hundred dollars .
i &apos;m serious .
me , too .
just tell your dad you had the drunkies .
and invited a boy over .
yeah .
mm , i think that will go over real well .
somebody else knows alison &apos;s alive
and they just told the cops .
does holbrook know who it &apos;s from ?
did he say if it was from a guy or a girl ?
it &apos;s anonymous .
and they &apos;re still trying to figure it out .
i &apos;ll be right back .
what &apos;s up ?
your text said i should come find you .
yeah , my mom wanted to invite you and your family over for dinner
just to say thanks for everything .
that &apos;s really nice of her ,
but she doesn &apos;t have to go through that .
trust me , you don &apos;t want to miss it .
she doesn &apos;t really cook often ,
but when she does it &apos;s pretty amazing .
okay .
you know , i was thinking
maybe you and i could do a meal sometime .
just the two of us .
sure .
wait , is that like a date ?
i actually hope it will be .
how about tomorrow night ?
yeah , okay .
okay .
did he just ask you out ?
okay , i &apos;m not digging the timing , but ...
are you even ready for that ?
no , i &apos;m ready .
i just hope nothing else crazy happens between now and then .
drinking a glass of salad
is supposed to give me my life back ?
your body needs the nutrition .
you &apos;ll feel stronger , you &apos;ll think clearer ,
you &apos;ll sleep better .
i sleep just fine .
i heard you doing laundry at 2 : 00 in the morning .
my sheets were dirty .
what , do you want to analyze those , too ?
i just thought it was unusual .
you know , with adhd meds people tend to
sleep a lot during withdrawal .
and you &apos;re definitely irritable .
any flu @-@ like symptoms ?
not anymore .
what about nightmares ?
um , what about hallucinations ?
maybe .
they &apos;re nothing to worry about .
it &apos;s just your mind and body getting reacquainted .
take drugs away and things come up .
what kind of things ?
things you &apos;ve forgotten .
things you &apos;ve suppressed .
things you need to deal with .
when i was first in recovery ,
a healthy diet and exercise really worked for me .
i mean , it took the edge off .
it &apos;s worth a try .
ever do yoga ?
no , not usually .
i don &apos;t really excel at athletics
unless there &apos;s somebody to beat .
i &apos;d like to avoid competition .
i think that drive may have triggered your abuse
in the first place .
but kicking your ass at tennis
might be very therapeutic .
yeah , i get the feeling
you &apos;d like to kick my ass , period .
but i &apos;m in the barn
until your parents and doctor say otherwise .
so get motivated .
we &apos;ve got a lot to cover today .
i &apos;m just gonna take a quick shower .
toby , hey , please i really , really need to talk to you .
i &apos;m starting to worry because i haven &apos;t heard from you .
i just need you to tell me that i &apos;m not ,
like , a horrible person .
how come i don &apos;t hear any running water ?
hanna ,
i know what you did .
and i am not amused .
since when is getting a skinny latte a crime ?
we &apos;re not here to joke around , hanna .
gabe , what is she talking about ?
it won &apos;t be hard for me to match your handwriting to the note .
when i do , i &apos;ll have to bring you down for questioning .
hanna , if there &apos;s anything else you have to say
about the note , now is the time .
she &apos;s not going to find anything .
i swear , i didn &apos;t write it .
&quot; good cop , bad cop , &quot; i thought that would do the job ,
but she &apos;s one tough little cookie .
i kind of like her .
we arrested her mother and we were wrong .
and we put that family through hell .
my gut tells me that she &apos;s trying to do the same thing .
she &apos;s giving us the runaround .
i know this girl .
something doesn &apos;t jive .
i think that note &apos;s legit .
you &apos;re on your own with that theory .
but keep an eye on her .
let &apos;s see if she takes this to one of her friends .
maybe they &apos;re all in on it .
is that your dad ?
yep .
he wants to take me into some restaurant tonight ,
a little quality father @-@ daughter time .
jeremiah &apos;s ?
yeah .
how did you know that ?
that &apos;s the only good vegetarian place around here .
how do you know so much about su ?
i thought that you were from cedar rapids .
i am . but my parents went to school here .
they met on campus in chem lab , freshman year .
i have three older sisters
and they all graduated from syracuse , too .
summa cum laude .
let me guess .
you don &apos;t want to continue the tradition ?
i got into berklee college of music .
wow . that &apos;s amazing .
yeah , well , my parents don &apos;t think
music is the kind of thing you study .
what about you ?
i-- i love music .
you know what i mean .
you clearly didn &apos;t come here to look at a college .
um , some jerk just broke my heart into ,
like , 30,000 million pieces .
that &apos;s a lot .
tell me about it .
anyway , so , yeah , he &apos;s back home and that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
just needed to disappear for a little bit , i guess .
that doesn &apos;t seem right .
he &apos;s the jerk , but you &apos;re the one in exile ?
shouldn &apos;t it be the other way around ?
not that i &apos;m complaining or anything .
yeah , you better not be .
i can finish this .
why don &apos;t you go up and put your laundry away ?
okay .
thanks .
i &apos;ll get it .
spencer .
veronica , may i come in ?
i was just stopping by to see
if you got the flyer i left in your mailbox
about the bridal show fund @-@ raiser .
i did .
i didn &apos;t get your rsvp .
oh . i &apos;ll have to check the calendar .
i &apos;ll be right back .
you &apos;re looking well .
your mother told me that you had a bug .
your outburst at my home was a reaction
to some over @-@ the @-@ counter medication ?
yeah , yeah .
next time i &apos;ll be sure to buy name brand .
i &apos;m so sorry for everything that i said
and for the way that i grabbed you .
i really was not myself .
no apology necessary .
my guess is she &apos;s in there writing a check .
i wouldn &apos;t expect her to attend .
but it &apos;s all for a good cause .
you know , the charity feeds starving children .
no mother should have to watch her child die .
i should probably just take my laundry up
and go to bed .
nothing beats a good night &apos;s sleep
on a set of fresh , clean sheets .
i &apos;m sorry , jessica .
we have another commitment that night .
i hope this helps .
thank you . i so appreciate your generosity .
goodbye , spencer .
well , you sure do look nice .
you ready for our last big day ?
i actually just came by to let you know
i &apos;m gonna cut out early .
head back home .
maybe take antonio on the scenic route .
you &apos;re gonna go talk to your folks about berklee ?
that &apos;s the plan .
look , i just wanted to say ,
i thought this was gonna be a pretty unbearable week
and it ended up being pretty great .
so thank you .
you should find me if you &apos;re ever in rosewood .
count on it .
bye .
thank you .
hey . have you talked to aria ?
not today . why ?
she &apos;s not answering any of my calls or texts .
look , if you hear from her , tell her i said , &quot; thanks . &quot;
mike , hold on .
can you take over for a sec ?
thanks .
what &apos;s going on ?
aria got what she wanted .
mona dumped me this morning .
i got a text really early that said we &apos;re done .
just like that .
okay , i &apos;m sorry that happened
but i don &apos;t think aria was involved .
oh , so the fact that you guys can &apos;t stand her
has nothing to do with it ?
i can &apos;t think of another reason
why mona would just cut me off like a wart .
maybe i could talk to her .
find out what &apos;s going on .
whatever .
just tell aria to call me .
hey , we just did 3 loops , that &apos;s 3 miles .
and now we &apos;re doing an extra loop
for your little phone stunt yesterday .
god , why are you so mean , dean ?
because you make me tense , spence .
i mean how long are you gonna keep this up ?
rhyming ? i could go all day .
i can see that you &apos;re a smart girl
with a sharp tongue , and you love to spar .
but getting under my skin isn &apos;t the goal here .
it &apos;s getting under yours so we can address
what &apos;s really going on .
do you have any interest in that ?
one more mile . let &apos;s go .
damn it , ali , i said stop it .
hey , hey , take a deep breath .
now tell me what &apos;s going on .
i think i know what i did .
do you ever think that sometimes people see you
more clearly than you see yourself ?
i &apos;m not sure what you mean .
there are things that happened
that i don &apos;t remember and other people do .
and you &apos;re using their memories to fill in the blanks ?
yeah . what else can i do ?
well , maybe recalling what really happened
is a little too much to wrap your head around right now .
i mean i should have known
that i was capable of something like this .
i &apos;ve done bad things before .
wait .
look , before you go to that place ,
i want you to look at what happened today as a positive .
it sounds like to me , at least emotionally ,
you &apos;re ready to take responsibility for your actions .
you want to know what you did ,
maybe make good on a few things .
how am i supposed to take responsibility ?
i mean if i-- if i really did this .
did what , spencer ?
nothing . nothing . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m really talked @-@ out right now .
i think we &apos;ve covered enough .
i &apos;m gonna give you some space
so you can read that .
just so you know , i &apos;m a picker .
so whatever i order ,
the other person &apos;s plate always looks better .
what does that even mean ?
it means whatever you order , get a side of garlic bread .
hanna ?
hi , mrs. d.
don &apos;t you look lovely tonight ?
are we on a date ?
yeah . yeah . this is travis .
nice to meet you .
such a gentleman .
i won &apos;t keep you .
you two enjoy yourselves .
mrs. dilaurentis ?
lieutenant tanner .
detective holbrook .
please come with us .
i &apos;m sorry . this will just take one moment .
uh , so if you want the garlic bread ,
maybe i should order the lasagna .
yeah , yeah , sounds good .
i need to talk to you .
i have somewhere to be .
going to meet with ezra fitz ?
get in .
aria .
can i come in ?
why would you help him ?
i &apos;m surprised it took you this long to figure it out .
and i kind of expected it would be aria .
he should have told her about the book a long time ago .
when did you find out ?
around the time i bought jenna &apos;s car .
but i didn &apos;t want to help him with his tattle @-@ tale ,
i wanted to stop him .
or at least , stop the parts that included me ,
some of the stuff i did , i could still go to jail for .
so we made a deal .
i would answer questions about my exploits ,
and he &apos;d edit out anything i did that was less than legal .
did you read the book ?
do you know what it says about alison ?
if alison were alive ,
i &apos;m sure she &apos;d love being
the focus of a scandalous page @-@ turner .
but no , ezra only showed me parts of chapters
i was written into .
i never saw the whole thing .
i didn &apos;t come here to hash things out .
i came here to tell you that you need to leave .
yeah , i understand you need your space .
no , i don &apos;t think that you understand .
i do .
i spoke with hackett yesterday
and i &apos;m taking a leave of absence .
no , ezra .
you need to leave town . for good .
aria , we can work through this .
i don &apos;t want to work through this .
i don &apos;t want to run into you at the grocery
or every time i grab coffee with my friends
i don &apos;t want to see you .
i don &apos;t want to hear from you . ever .
so you dated mike to get closer to aria ,
so you could spy on her .
mike &apos;s a really sweet guy .
i fell for him .
when you guys started to catch on ,
i tried to tell fitz i wanted out .
he said that wasn &apos;t an option .
i didn &apos;t want to drag mike into my mess , so i let him go .
you went through all that and got nothing ?
not nothing .
it &apos;s murky , but it &apos;s big .
remember , after the lodge burned down ,
i told you all that someone stole the game from me
when i was in radley ?
we all thought it was cece .
i never found out .
but whoever it is , ezra thinks he knows .
this is a copy of my manuscript .
thanks , but i think i &apos;ll wait till it &apos;s in the clearance bin .
i really think you should read it .
i found some stuff out that can really help you .
and for what it &apos;s worth ,
i was in new york returning my publisher &apos;s advance .
i thought if i pulled the plug--
it &apos;s too late , ezra .
well , i guess this is good @-@ bye then .
i &apos;m about to kill this dessert .
you &apos;d better jump in if you want a bite .
oh , no , you can finish it .
something wrong ?
look , travis , i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;ve got to go .
can i please just pay for my half ?
i don &apos;t go dutch on the first date .
you sure everything &apos;s okay ?
do you want me to drop you somewhere ?
no , it &apos;s just a friend .
i knew something was up .
you &apos;ve been distracted almost the whole night .
and it &apos;s not just since that text came in .
i &apos;m just a little rusty .
it &apos;s been a while since i &apos;ve been on a date .
come on , this wasn &apos;t a date .
your phone makes a lousy third wheel .
look , it won &apos;t happen again , i promise .
i just-- i really have to go .
thanks .
look , i know it didn &apos;t seem like it ,
but i had a really great time .
so you think that mona left that anonymous tip ?
well , if she was upset that she had to dump mike ,
maybe she was trying to make fitz pay .
it could all lead back to ezra .
it might stop him from publishing
while they investigate .
em , how long has this been there ?
what-- what are you talking about ?
the blue envelope .
it &apos;s a note from paige . why ?
sorry .
i had to finish reading it to be sure , but--
ezra gave me a copy of his book .
you talked to him ?
mona dumped your brother ,
and he thinks you made her do it ,
but really it was because of ezra .
sorry . housekeeping .
yeah , i &apos;ll deal with that .
you &apos;re back . are you better ?
better , yeah , but it &apos;s your sos ,
so why don &apos;t you go first ?
okay , there is something that ezra wanted us to know .
i thought you went to syracuse to get away from him ?
what changed ?
i-- i just figured out how to say what needed to be said .
and then he gave me a copy of his book .
you guys , you &apos;re never going to believe this ,
but ezra thinks that &quot; a &quot; is ali &apos;s mom .
are you sure that &apos;s what it says
that mrs. dilaurentis is &quot; a &quot; ?
that &apos;s ridiculous . how old is she ?
does she even know how to text ?
&quot; a &quot; has been telling us to stop going after alison
probably because &quot; a &quot; wants to bring her home .
but that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;ve been trying to do .
why would mrs. dilaurentis think that we were in the way ?
maybe because she thinks i tried to kill ali .
when did ali &apos;s mom accuse you of attempted murder ?
and why are you just now telling us this ?
look , the other night i found a bunch of dirt
in the bottom of my bed
and ali &apos;s mom made some cryptic comment about it .
don &apos;t pin that on her .
i mean that sounds like an &quot; a &quot; move .
which is why i think she &apos;s &quot; a. &quot;
mrs. d being &quot; a &quot; makes about as much sense
as you whacking ali over the head with a shovel .
i could have .
cece told ezra that both she and mrs. dilaurentis
saw me pick up a shovel and go after ali .
but alison is still alive .
we argued that night , okay .
and we &apos;d all been drinking
but i was also on amphetamines .
i don &apos;t remember anything
and lately i &apos;ve been seeing things .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s just me coming off of the drugs
or if it is a guilty conscience .
but if two people saw me--
why believe anything cece says ?
because it wasn &apos;t just cece .
ezra put it in his book , okay .
he thinks that one of us tried to kill her
and that person is probably me .
the only person that knows what really happened is alison .
yeah , and she &apos;s not here to help us , is she ?
i can &apos;t talk about this anymore .
i &apos;m gonna get a snack .
somebody want anything ?
yeah , sure .
i &apos;m not hungry .
i &apos;ll come with you .
hey , em , can i ask you something ?
we don &apos;t have any cheesy puffs .
my mom says the orange powder has chemicals in it
that make you break out .
no , it &apos;s-- look , it &apos;s important
and i need you to tell me the truth .
you told paige that alison &apos;s alive , didn &apos;t you ?
dad put some leftovers in the fridge for you .
i ate &apos; em .
it &apos;s fine , i had something at emily &apos;s .
i heard about mona .
mike , i &apos;m really sorry .
i know how much it hurts .
you know that i would never--
i know .
it was just easier to blame you
than admit you were right all along .
maybe about this .
but there are plenty of other things
that i &apos;m wrong about .
are we going to have to lock you in your room at night ?
mom , i &apos;m sorry .
it was really , really important .
more important than staying sober ?
no .
were you out looking for drugs ?
what ? mom , no .
the drawer was open .
did you-- give me your phone .
what does &quot; sos &quot; mean ?
and why were you meeting up at emily &apos;s ?
hanging out with your friends ,
that &apos;s what was so important ?
i &apos;m about ready to throw my hands up .
you keep flirting with disaster no matter
how hard we try to protect you .
maybe you should stop .
it &apos;s about a quarter past sarcasm , spencer .
you want to try another tone ?
i &apos;m not being sarcastic .
you and dad said that you covered for me
that summer when i was first using .
what did you mean ?
because i still don &apos;t remember .
consider it a blessing .
i &apos;m going to bed .
i suggest you do the same .
spencer ?
spencer ?
are you okay ?
