It's impossible to describe the panic
That comes over you when you're a surgeon
And your pager goes off in the middle of the night.
Your heart starts to race.
Please don't be mine.
Don't be mine.
Your mind freezes.
Don't be mine.
Your fingers go numb.
Not mine.
Wake up.
Oh! I'm up.
They're paging you.
You're invested.
I'm sleeping!
They're someone's mom,
Someone's dad, someone's kid,
And now it's on you,
Because that someone's life is now in your hands.
Robbins, Karev's with your patient in trauma two.
Torres, come with me.
We have a 15-year-old female.
She fell off the roof of her house.
Now I think that we should--
She's gonna be okay, right?
Please, I just need to know.
Is she gonna be okay?
And this is her mother.
Mrs. Boyd,
I need to bring Dr. Torres up to speed right now, okay?
She's never been in any accident before.
She's never even broken any bones.
Oh, you paged me here at 4:00 a.m.
For a couple of broken bones?
More like 50.
As surgeons,
We're always invested in our patients.
Laura Young, 30 weeks pregnant.
Car accident. head c.t.
Showed a subdural.
Shepherd's coming in. Baby's in distress.
O.b.'s on its way.
Oh, it hurts. It really hurts.
Okay, wait. Hold on. Stop. Move the wand up.
What?
Okay, baby's brain is hemorrhaging.
She needs a crash "c" while Shepherd handles the bleed.
Get ready to grab a rail and start running.
But when your patient's a child...
Get another unit of packed cells, meet me in the o.r.
Right away.
You're not just invested...
oh. we need the o.r.
You're responsible...
Well, we need it, too. We're already on our way.
There's only one o.r. prepped this time of night.
Which is why we need it.
Mine's got a subdural.
50 broken bones.
Stroke in the womb!
All right, get another o.r. ready now.
Responsible for whether or not that child survives,
Has a future.
And that's enough to terrify anyone.
爱的代价
What's her status?
Mom's heart rate and, b.p. has been fluctuating,
But she's ready for you.
All right, let's prep her for a craniotomy.
Apgar's only 4.
We need to get to the nicu now.
All right, drain's in a good position.
Yeah, she's breathing over the vent.
Maybe we should consider extubating her?
Yeah, but watch for apneic episodes,
And keep an eye out for her c.b.c.
There's still too much blood draining from her head.
What time is it, karev?
Half past 8:00.
Half past 8:00. I've already been awake for 5 hours,
And my day hasn't even started.
Rough way to start your morning.
A stroke before you're even born--
Rough way to start a life.
Yeah.
Hey, I brought you some coffee.
Oh, you already have one.
Oh, no.
I want your coffee. I need your coffee.
Okay, when you see cristina, she is gonna be mad.
She's gonna be mad at me for not paging her in here last night,
Possibly mad at you for not waking her up either.
Now I am handling this. Do not engage her.
Do not provoke her. Simply ignore her, all right?
Oh, that's your plan--ignore the scalpel-hungry animal?
Yep, until I come up with something better.
Hmm.
Okay, I know this is the first time
On a peds rotation with me for some of you.
Not for others.
But I wanted you to understand that I run my peds unit
A little differently than you may be used to.
This is not general surgery in miniature.
These are the tiny humans. These are children.
They believe in magic. They play pretend.
There is fairy dust in their i.v. bags.
They hope and they cross their fingers And they make wishes.
And that makes them more resilient than adults.
They recover faster, survive worse. They believe.
In peds, we have...
Miracles and magic.
In peds, anything is possible.
Morning, Dr. robbins.
Good morning, Dr. wallace.
I see that you've already introduced yourself to Mr. and Mrs. boyd.
Yes. Reminds me of Hillary at that age.
Such an overachiever.
Dr. yang, why don't you present?
Yeah.
Excuse me, little... doctor boy.
Hillary Boyd, 15 years old, fell off the roof of her house.
52 acute fractures were diagnosed
When she was admitted last night.
An intricate and extremely challenging
O.r.i.f. surgery
Was performed by Dr. Torres and Dr. Hunt
This morning before rounds.
Thank you, Dr. Yang.
If she fares well enough today, I'd like
To go in tomorrow to repair her subtrochanteric fracture next.
Can anyone tell me
The proper dosage of ceftriaxone for a pediatric patient?
50 milligrams per kilogram per day.
Mm-hmm.
And, Dr. Wallace, can you tell me
The proper dose for this patient if she were 42 kilograms?
2.1 grams per day...
If you carry the decimal.
Okay, who's presenting?
I am, Dr. Robbins.
Proceed.
Wallace Anderson...10 years old--almost 11
been here for 7 months.
In and out over the past two years.
Suffers from short gut syndrome,
Which means he can't properly absorb nutrition.
Exactly. Dr. Percy?
15 intestinal surgeries to date,
Plus a bowel lengthening procedure,
Which helped for a while,
But recently, he's had to go back to being fed through t.p.n.
Yum.
How'd he do this morning?
We covered some pretty advanced algebraic conversions.
Dr. Robbins helps me with my math and science homework
By letting me go on rounds.
Fascinating.
We try to keep his life as normal as we can,
Even living in a hospital.
But I can skip my homework On friday, right,
Since it's my birthday?
Since it's your birthday.
What about Dr. Robbins? It is her birthday, too.
I'm afraid I can't skip my homework, Wallace,
But I can come celebrate with you like I promised.
Dr. robbins.
We've requested a meeting later with chief webber
And a representative from the hospital board.
And we'd like you there, too.
All right.
So they didn't give you any indication
As to what this meeting was about?
You know as much as I do.
You treated their son, right?
Well, you better pray that you didn't do something to piss them off.
God knows that this hospital can't afford
another misstep right now.
It's a pleasure to see you again, Paul.
Bethany, you look lovely.
We didn't think Wallace would see his 9th birthday,
Let alone his 10th.
And now this week, his 11th.
Which is why we'd like to offer
Seattle Grace Mercy West's peds program a gift
Of $25 million.
$25 million?
Half to go to research to continue searching for a cure
For Wallace's condition,
And half to the hospital itself.
Uh... I...
I mean...
$25 million?
Happy birthday, Arizona.
I always knew that Wallace's parents were wealthy,
But not $25-million wealthy.I mean,
That's "libraries named after you" kind of money,
"Saved babies in Africa and has dinner
At the white house regularly" type money.
People don't give me that kind of money.
You have an unfair advantage. You work with children.
Oatmeal, side of fruit, wheat toast, hold the butter.
Thank you.
You know what? That money is gonna make such a difference
For so many patients. It's--it's really amazing.
Maybe I should start doing more cleft-palate kids.
Everyone's a sucker for those.
Cheese omelet, extra butter, cinnamon toast,crispy bacon.
Mine!
$25 million is pretty cool, right?
Yeah.
Best birthday gift ever.
Birthday gift?
Yeah.
Well, 'c-cause the money's a gift.
I mean, technically it's for the hospital,
not Arizona,
But since your birthday's on friday
um...How does little Grey know about your birthday
And I don't?
Birthdays are just days like any other days.
I don't like them. Don't celebrate them.
No big deal. $25 million?
That's a big deal.
Crap. I'm gonna be late. I will see you there.
Okay, she's downplaying it, right?
I'm her girlfriend.
I have to do something for her birthday, right?
Yes.
No.
Of course you do.
Oh! oh! a-a surprise party.
Whoa, whoa. Bad idea.
Surprise parties are hostile.
They're dark.
People jump out and scream at you.
They never come to any good.
Karev.
Good morning, chief.
Uh, when you're free, come find me.
What's that all about?
He fired me. And I refused to be fired.
So I say hello to him every morning,
And he says not a word.
Sounds familiar.
You haven't heard from Stevens?
Not a word.
They'll come around when they come around.
Chief, you need me?
Uh, I wish I didn't have to saddle you with this, Karev, but
What is all this?
As Stevens left no forwarding address,
And as you are officially her next of kin,
This is her unpaid balance of her medical bills.
Unpaid balance? I-I don't get it.
We work here at the hospital.
Yeah, and insurance doesn't take care of everything.
I'm sorry,
But accounting's been pressuring me since the merger,
And I can't ignore it any longer.
What's yours in for?
Mm, delivered her yesterday.
Stroked out at 10 weeks premature.
Yours?
Born with its insides on the outside.
Two days post-op.
Resilient little guy.
More bleeding overnight.
Should we try f.f.p.?
At this point, we should try anything.
Get me a repeat m.r.i. and page me
If she becomes bradycardic or starts having apnea spells.
I'll be on rounds.
Um, I was picking up some labs from Dr. Bailey,
And I saw that you had these waiting.
Thought I'd bring 'em by, save you the trip.
Thanks.
Are you okay?
I overheard a little bit of your conversation with the chief.
I'm trying to save a baby here. Get outta my face.
Got it.
Is he still sleeping?
No.
He had a bad night.
I can still go on rounds.
I feel better. Just give me a second.
You know what? How about if you just take a rest for now.
And then you can join me for evening rounds instead?
Okay.
He listens to you more than he does to me.
Well, yeah. she's a doctor, Mom.
And you're just... well, a mom.
Oh. Okay.
Well, how about you close your eyes
And you let me do what moms do, okay?
Bad dreams, bad dreams, go away.
Good dreams, good dreams, here to stay.
Bad dreams, bad dreams, go away.
Good dreams, good dreams, here to stay.
You have to do it three times for it to work.
Oops. One more.
He's had bad nights before, but I want to make sure
That we're not missing anything.
How's she doing?
Touch and go.
How's the baby?
Same.
Any news from the family?
No, I left a message. haven't heard back yet.
I.c.p. is elevated. b.p. won't stabilize.
Uh, 100 mics of fentanyl, please.
Laura? Laura, can you hear me?
My baby. Where's my baby?
She's struggling, but she's hanging on.
Can I see her?
I'm sorry. no. you're too unstable to move.
So is the baby.
I just want to hold her. Mm-hmm.
Please. I want to hold my baby.
Laura, I need you to stay calm, okay?Laura
just-- what if she dies before I get to hold her?
She can't.
She can't go before she's ever even been held.
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.
Push 10 of diazepam
and give me some supplemental 0-2, please.
Crap. 9-1-1. it's her baby.
She's bradying down and she lost access.
I'll start CPAP.
Dr. Robbins.
Not right now.
I think you're gonna want to see this.
It's the x-rays on Wallace Anderson.
all right, show me.
See? he has dilated loops of bowel.
All right, flip.
Flip.
Damn it. damn it.
He has another bowel obstruction,
And he's not compensating.Okay.
I've got this. go.
A nurse just checked that.
Yeah, a nurse checked it,
I'm gonna check it,
And three other people in the o.r. are gonna check it.
We're through.
Honey, please let them do their jobs.
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.
We thought that you should know that
Hillary's tox screens from yesterday
Show signs psilocybin in her bloodstream.
What does that mean?
Well, it means that when she fell from the roof,
She was--
Mushrooming.
Yeah. magic mushrooms.
What? hillary?
Mushrooms?
oh, come on.
Can everybody please chill out?
What in god's name were you thinking?
You know, I can't believe...
You're a disappointment, young lady,
A big, big, disappointment.
dad, please
Okay, the last thing I am is a disappointment.
I get straight a's. I'm on honor roll.
I run the student council.
I basically am the school paper,
And I tutor kids with reading problems. okay?
I'm every parent's dream come true, including yours.
I was exploring the bounds of my consciousness
With the help of a mushroom.
I made a calculated risk going on that roof.
Falling off? well, that was a low-probability event,
And even low-probability events occasionally occur,
And this one did.
So, yeah, you're bummed I miscalculated
Cause it reminds you of your own fallibility.
I'm bummed, too.
Let's just leave it at that.
Cap refill is five seconds.
Push one of epi.
It's not working. heart rate's down to the 60s.
Starting compressions.
Could I help?
Doubt it. at this rate,
This kid's not gonna last more than an hour.
She's only 30 weeks. pretty young to survive.
So what, you're just gonna stand there and watch her die?
Mm, pretty much.
That sucks.
It is what it is. it's protocol.
Beeping drives me nuts.
Look, I mean--
The kid's gonna die. deal with it or get out.
Hey there, girl.
I got you. yeah.
It's okay.
You're not alone.
No, you're not. you're not alone.
Wait. hold on.
Are you saying you can't do more surgery on him,
Or you won't?
It's not a question of if I can.
It's whether or not I should.
In my opinion, wallace isn't strong enough
To handle another operation.
But with surgery, how long would he have then?
I... I'm not confident
That he'll even make it off the table.
But if he did, how long?
I strongly advise against--
How long?
Maybe two months. I...
I'm s--I'm sorry.
But the moment that we've been fighting for two years...
It's here.
So you need to prepare yourselves
And you need to prepare wallace.
You think I've been pouring all this money into research
So that you could find a cure for some other kid?
Mr. Anderson--
No.
you have to do this surgery.
Mr. Anderson, I'm--
You buy our son two more months.
You buy him more time
so that we can buy him a cure.
I'm sorry.
Robbins.
These aren't people who hear the word no.
If they want surgery for their son,
They'll get surgery for their son,
Whether or not you're the one to do it.
You've been with this boy since day one.
I believe you can do this successfully.
Don't walk away now
Unless you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you can't.
The surgery is a bad idea, chief.
But is it impossible?
In your hands... is it impossible?
Okay.
Okay?
Okay, I'll do it. I'll try.
Oh,Is that the preemie?
Oh, yeah. I was just, uh... Well, I tried everything.
I just thought maybe somebody should hold her
Before, you know, she...
Kangaroo.
What?
The way you're holding the baby,
It's called a kangaroo hold.
Uh, there's been cases where the kangaroo
Has helped babies thrive.
But look, Karev, look at the numbers.
Look at this.
heart rate's going up.
Yeah, it is, and her temperature is normal.
Karev, you may have just
Kick-started this baby's entire system.
Just by holding her?
Take off your shirt.
What? no. take off your shirt.
No, no.
Just--the kangaroo hold,
It's most effective when there's skin-on-skin contact.
It's usuallyhe mom, but, you know,
You're gonna have to do.
I'm not kidding. take off your shirt.
Well, it looks like you used
Pretty much every piece of hardware in the hospital.
Yeah, it makes you think twice about mushrooming on a roof.
And the mouth on this one?
If I talked to my parents like that--
oh, my father would've...
Oh, you don't even want to know.
I had perfect grades, perfect record,
And I said whatever I wanted, did whatever I wanted.
My parents couldn't do a thing about it.
Want to hear about my childhood?
No? okay.
I'll just, uh, think about it quietly in my own head.
All right, nails in, everything's tight.
Let's take a look.
Fantastic.
End-tidal c-0-2 just dropped from 34 to 22.
Oh, come on. give me a break here, Hillary.
She has a new murmur.
There's an air embolus in her heart.
All right, flood the field with saline.
Give me the bone wax. Page cardio
And set up a chest tray.
And put her in trendelenburg.
I can...I can operate
No, no, we wait for cardio
And we try to find the source.
No, it'll only take 30 second.
It might take cardio half an hour to get here.
Dr. Yang
I've done this before. I know what I'm doing.
She could arrest at any moment.
Dr. Yang, no. End up the discussion.
See? It's the skin-to-skin contact.
The baby can feel your warmth better,
Sense your heartbeat better. See that?
The baby's own heart is picking up in response.
Karev, what are you doing?
He's saving a baby's life, that's what.
Dr. Bailey, I... oh, no shirt.
He's wearing no shirt.
Have you started to lactate yet?
Bailey made me.
Is this the room for the calendar shoot?
I was told it was downstairs.
Yeah, all right.
Everybody out.
Let karev do what he's doing in private.
What is he doing exactly?
Out.
Out.
This is ridiculous.
You're wasting all this time down here,
When we should be dealing withI the heart problem directly.
We are following protoco and we can
Find the source of the embolus this way.
Screw it.
Dr. Yang, the patient is not coding,
And you are not qualified to do this.
Opening the left chest.
Oh, Yang, really?
Turn on the fluoro.
Dr. ya.
Will someone please step on the fluoro?
Or do you want me to go in blind?
Dr. Yang, put down that scalpel!
Thank you.
Cristina!
Scissors.
Cristina!
Cristina!
Cardio's here, Yang.
It's done. I'm done.
Air embolus out.
The patient was crashing.
She was not crashing.
It was a procedure I've done before.
I handled it, and she's fine.
Yeah, but what if she wasn't?
You could've lacerated her heart
Or cut the phrenic nerve.
She could've died on that table. What then?
It would've been your license.
All so you could prove what exactly?
Well, I did it to stabilize the patient.
You were just watching her vitals drop.
Waitg for a C.T. surgeon
To take a more minimally invasive approach.
I could've done a thoracotomy myself
If I had thought was indicated.
I've been around the block once or twice.
You know I kinda...I kind know what I'm doing.
I'm aware of it. I was just...
You just thought ever--
You just thought you just thought
Everything would be better if you took charge.
And you know I have to report this to the chief, right?
At a time when he is scouring this place for people to fire.
Well, he's not gonna fire me.
Oh, --of course not,
Cause you're...you're invincible.
No, he's not gonna fire me
Because the last time that I did an open thoracotomy
For an embolus was with him in his o.r.
Only he was giving me words of encouragement,
Not screaming in my ear.
For the record, you rock that in there.
Hunt's just jealous he didn't do it himself.
Shut up.
Okay, you won't believe what just happened in the surgery
Hey. You okay?
Tell me I'm great.
What?
I need for you to tell me that I'm great.
You're great.
I mean really tell me,
Because I'm about to go in on a surgery right now
That I'm not sure I should be going in on,
And I can't think like that, right?
I can't go into the o.r. feeling like this.
So... I need you to tell me I'm great,
And make me... make me hear it.
You are great.
You...
Are... great.
Thank you.
Hey there.
You ready to go?
I was gonna take you to the o.r. myself.
I've been here a while now, Dr. robbins.
And... I've seen kids go home or go away.
Like Evan-- the kid from down the hall
With asthma last month.
He died the day before he was supposed to be discharged.
You're not Evan.
and Chloe--the heart girl?
She was here for three weeks before she died.
No one says yore gonna die.
I've been re for seven months.
I've been here t longest of anyone on the floor,
By double.
Wallac
They say it's like going to sleep.
And maybe it is.
But what if I go to sleep,
and I have nightmares?
More traction, please.
Damn it. the mesentery's really friable.
Percy, a little help on the suction.
This is not a good idea.
This surgery-- not a good idea.
Could we get a washcloth for Dr. robbins, please?
No, it's fine.
Just take a moment.
Thank you.
Pick ups, please.
I left you messages.
I'm sorry. I was in surgery.
There were complications.
I don't care, okay?
I operated on Wallace tonight even when I knew better.
And I keep retracing every step, every suture,
And I keep going over it and over it--
He didn't make it?
He did.
He's in recovery. that's not the point.
What I needed from you tonight was a little surrport for once,
And you weren't here.
Okay, you're scared,
And so you're picking a fight, You get that, yeah?
Yeah. yeah. fine. whatever.
But I have helped you through crisis after crisis.
And once I thought that I could come here tonight,
And I could get something-- It's done.
I have every right to be mad, Cristina.
You would've never pulled a stunt like that with another attending.
I seem to recall Callie was there and don't stop me.
Okay, guys, not now.
You took advantage of me
And you took advantage of our relationship.
Oh, please. the kid was dying.
Wait.what kid? what happened?
Oh, so you didn't hear?
No.
No, I didn't.
Cristina--she performed an unauthorized
And unnecessary thoracotomy against my orders.
She what?
I saved the patient's life.
Wait. okay, so you were there, and you didn't tell me?
I was going to, but you were all, "tell me I'm great."
So-- oh, so it's my fault that
Yang went rogue on a child?
No-- no, you know what? it wasn't rogue.
It was brilliant.
No, it wasn't.
You know, I--I'm done.
You got lucky today, cristina.
And you may think that you can
get away with whatever you want,
But I am telling you, one of these days,
That luck's gonna run out.
Look... what?
Oh, okay. so you're leaving, too?
Yes, because I have a patient.
Bitches.
All right, start an epI drip now.
More irrigation. just keep it coming.
Give me a babcock clamp.
Clamp.
Damn it. I need more light.
Can somebody get me more light?
Pressure's dropping to 68 over 40. pulse is racing.
Come on, Wallace.
What the hell happened to the Anderson boy?
He's infective shock。
His body was too unstable to handle the surgery,
Which is what I said in the first place.
You know, I can help.
No! no, you can't.
because as long as you're standing
There breathing over my shoulder,
I feel like I'm operating on a stack of dollar bills--
$25-million-dollar bills--
And what I need to be invested in right now is this kid.
So please get the hell out of my o.r.!
More suction now.
How'd it go?
Damn it.
I'll let them know you did everything you could.
Wait, Dr. robbins,
Don't we have to tell the parents,
Let them know that he didn't make it?
No.
What do you mean, no?
I mean no.
I will not be speaking to Wallace's parents.
Mr. Jennings and the chief will take care of that formality,
Because as far as they're concerned
And as far as the Andersons will be concerned,
I just killed their son.
I'm a liability,
Because if they were to ask me the truth,
I would tell them that I did just kill their son.
And they should sue, and I am responsible.
But that's not in the best interests of the hospital.
Am I close?
Yeah, I think we're on the same page.
My luck will run out.
It has nothing to do with luck
He's being an ass.
You know what? I rocked that embolus.
What?
He cares about you.
so?
So? So maybe he's a little bit right.
I get it.
I mean, I'm dying to get out of this bed and cut,
But you did an unauthorized procedure in an O.R.
I mean, you're an amazing surgeon,
But if anything had gone wrong, that would've be your career.
I mean, he cares about your career.
He's in love with you.
I hate... married, happy you.
Go to work,
And don't cut anybody open without permission.
You shoul've seen Yang in that surgery.
I mean she was fearless.
And you are hopeless.
She's completely out of your league.
Oh, I'm hopeless, huh?
I'm just... stupid.
He's married, and have I mentioned, a total ass
To pretty much everyone at all times?
Karev?
Did you stay here all night?
Uh, yeah. I... I guess I did.
Go home, get some rest.
The nurse will take over for you.
No. uh, I--I'm okay. I'm...
I'm good here.
Well, you'd be good in peds, you know that?
You get invested.
You have good instincts.
You stick to your instincts.
You'd be good in peds, Karev.
Yeah, I know. they, uh, say I can have visitors tomorrow.
Cool. and, um, do you have any loopies?
Or whatever you have.
They only have me on 2 milligrams of morphine at a time.
I know. How lame is that? It just--
Hey, little pusher girl. I'm Hillary's doctor.
And now I have Hillary's phone.
So I'm gonna give this number to the police.
How lame is that?
What the hell?
Okay. uh, I know you think you can do anything
And say anything and handle anything.
And that's, you know, almost true,
Except for the fact that you fell off a roof
Cause you were so high that you, what,
You thought you could fly?
In surgery, you almost died of a heart complication
Because your body is so strung out
From all the crap you've been putting in it
That it almost shut down completely.
Okay, that doesn't make you smarter than everyone else.
It makes you an idiot.
The only reason why you're alive is...
You know, is 'cause you're lucky.
So just, you know, grow up.
Surprise!
I...
I... um...
I-I...
Told you.
Okay, in retrospect,
I realize now that surprise parties are hostile,
And this was a bad idea.
Please stop crying. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about the party.
Wallace died.
And he's supposed to be turning 11 today,
And instead, he's lying in a morgue.
Oh... god.
No, um...
I'm--I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I-I can't-- I can't stay.
No, it's okay. It's okay.
I'll take care of it. You don't have to stay.
Just--I understand. We're all surgeons.
Everyone will understand.
I...
Okay. Just go.
Might as well take advantage, huh?
What?
The party's a dud,
But at least there's free booze, right?
Right.
Go ahead and gloat.
Surprise parties never come to any good.
I think this party speaks for itself.
I don't get it.
You know, the best birthday of my life
Was the surprise party that my parents threw.
I-I-I loved it so much.
How old were you at this party?
7.
Mm. like I said, it speaks for itself.
If there's--if there's anything that we can get for you,
Uh, help you with, please just--just, uh, let us know.
I-I'd be more than happy to oversee any packing
That you need done from his room.
I've already arranged for a car if...
It's ready to take you home anytime.
Arizona.
Dr. robbins, this is a very sensitive time.
Let her be.
Excuse me?
I said... let her be.
It just doesn't feel real...
Any of it. it just...
It just doesn't feel real.
Bethany, would you like to see him?
I have to admit, I'm impressed.
I never would've pegged you for the babysitting type.
Are you heading home?
No, I got the baby.
Well, I'm sure somebody else could take a shift.
Do you want me to
I can't leave, okay?
Wow. are you really so messed up
That you can't let one person be nice to you, ever?
I can't go.
I can't go home.
I can't get Izzie to call me back.
She's... gone,
Could be dead for all I know.
She left me with a $200,000 medical bill,
And I-I...
I can't do anything about it...
About any of it.
But I can sit here and I can hold this baby.
That I can do.
Then I'll sit here with you for a little while.
Yang.
Doctor-- can I cristina you
Or are we not there yet?
That's a no. okay.
Dr. Yang, let me just tell you that
That was incredibly hot in the o.r. yesterday.
Very deeply hot. it was hot. you were hot.
Uh, you're drunk and you're in my room.
I... am, in fact, inebriated.
But that's legal, you know?
And even if I wasn't, you're the rule breaker,
Which I think we established in surgery.
Really, you think that was hot?
Would it be really, really bad if I just--
You know, 'cause of the the embolus thing
And you in general-- could I just...
Uh, no. I'm involved.
I'm involved.
Time to meet your mommy.
She's so beautiful.
They say, the bigger your investment
The bigger your return.
Surgery yesterday?
It wasn't just...
It was me.
Can't you see that?
See what?
See what? I...
I can't just ignore what happened, Cristina.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Look, I know, um... I know I overspped, so...
Come home with me.
Please.
But you have to be willing to take a chance.
Okay.
Bad dreams, bad dreams, go away.
Good dreams, good dreams, here to stay.
Good dreams, goodreams, here to stay.
Bad dreams, bad dreams, go away.
Good dreams, good dreams, here to stay.
Bad dreams, bad dreams, go away.
Good dreams, good dreams, here to stay--stay.
You have to do it three times for it--
For it to work. I know.
She is the reason...
We will still be giving
Seattle grace mercy west $25 million,
Not because of you or your ass kissing.
It's because of her--her.
You have to understand...
You might lose it all.
The chief still won't talk to me.
Oh, he will.
When did you become such an optimist?
This is married, happy me.
Can we, uh...
Are you okay to...
Yes, we can. mm.
But if you take that chance...
Are you heal?
I'm healed.
If you invest wisely...
The payoff might just surprise you.
Oh! I'm awake.
I'm aw--um, see? I'm-- I'm totally awake.
I'm--there's hats and gifts
And--and--and doughnuts
And lingerie.
Really?
I love you.
You do?
I do.
