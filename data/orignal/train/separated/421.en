3 women murdered inside a gated community
in southeastern New Mexico in the last 2 months.
All 3 inside.
Marjorie West was strangled in her home in the middle of the night
While her family was out of town.
They found her the next morning.
Jill Long was strangled in the laundry room
While her husband and sons were camping in the backyard.
And last night, Aubrey Jacobs was killed in her home office
While her daughter and husband were asleep in the house.
Occupied dwellings is as high-risk as it gets.
And he's fearless.
Proximity, the chance he might get caught--
that could be part of it for him.
You said gated community.
I'm assuming that means security?
A small security staff and perimeter cameras.
Everything's recorded 24-7, and no one has entered
or left the compound since last night except residents.
It looks like the unsub is part of the community.
The local detective says that demographics,general makeup,
and socioeconomic status of the residents is essentially the same.
That's going to make a profile difficult.
Unless we examine a different set of parameters.
Different parameters?
Rossi's working on that right now.
What took you so long, cadet?
What took you so long? Here you go.
The mannequin is your wounded partner.
You and your wounded partner must make it over that wall.
Where's your head at, cadet? What you thinking?
Let's move! Let's move!
Use the rope to get your partner over the wall.
Let's move!
Use the rope to get your partner over the wall, cadet.
Are you paying attention?
Are you thinking with your head?
Get your partner over the wall.
Here we go.
Move, cadet! Move, cadet!
There you go! There you go!
Watch her. That's how you do it!
That's how you do it, cadet!
There you go!
Yes! Yes!
That's about the fastest I've ever seen anyone figure that out.
Is this the first time she's ever done that?
Change the task every day.
Agent Seaver.
Sir.
You remember SSA Rossi from the Behavioral Analysis Unit?
Of course.
It's been quite a long time.
Yes, sir.
You weren't easy to find.
You're supposed to be working the reception desk
at the Washington field office.
I'm on my break.
I was told that I could run
the course in my free time if I wanted to.
My concussion--
At ease.
If this is how you want to spend your free time, you have at it.
I'm gonna let the two of you talk. Dave.
Thanks, Bill.
Yeah.
I know you're too busy to just visit.
I want to show you something.
Because of my impressive academy scores
Or my childhood?
Let's take a ride.
You remember Agent Hotchner?
Yes, of course.
Good to see you.
Hi.
Glad to see you're doing so well.
Thank you.
Have a seat.
Yes, sir.
I told Ashley
she may be able to help us with this case.
We have an unsub who manages to live
in close proximity to his victims
without raising an alarm.
That we've seen before.
What's new here is what the local police are telling us
about the community itself.
Demographically, everyone's basically the same.
Most of the parameters we would look for to build a profile
seem to exist in most of the men.
But we thought if the unsub has children,
and the statistics tell us that he probably does,
would the children exhibit certain specific behavior?
So this isn't about my academic scores.
No.
Great. Give me 15 minutes.
I have a change of clothes in the car.
Agent, we're not detailing you to the unit.
We want to ask you some questions.
Right. I see.
Do you have some concerns?
I want to help, and I know that I can.
But I don't think I can tell you what to look for
without seeing the families myself.
You understand you go only as a consultant on this one case?
I understand.
And you're to do nothing
without another member of the team present.
Yes, sir.
This won't be easy, Ashley.
It may trigger some extremely painful memories.
I appreciate the concern.
But when your father kills 25 women before you're a teenager,
painful memories don't need a trigger.
They just are.
"When we were children,
we used to think that when we grew up
we would no longer be vulnerable.
But to grow up is to accept vulnerability.
to be alive is to be vulnerable."
Writer Madeleine L'engle.
I've notified the primary detective
And the Oak Tree Hills security office of your requirements.
You should know that that security office
is particularly efficient.
Except someone's killing people right under their noses.
Call me old-fashioned,
But that doesn't seem like efficient security.
Yeah. I'm running background checks
On all the male residents, too.
Good. And check wider in new mexico
for similar crimes,
Stranglings in occupied dwellings.
Wish you, command me.
I shall call you the moment I have anything to contribute
Or an overwhelming desire to speak to
my beautiful Derek Morgan,
whichever comes first.
Let me guess who'll win.
And you'd be right.
I bid you adieu and safe travels, mon amis.
They called from downstairs. Ashley's on her way up.
Have you decided what to tell the team about who she is?
They're going to need to know.
But as far as how she wants to tell them,
I thought we might play that by ear.
I assume since she goes by Seaver
That she doesn't want people knowing who she is.
There she is.
Kind of makes you feel old, doesn't it?
No.
Me neither.
Ashley.
Agent trainee Seaver,
Supervisory special agents Prentiss and Morgan.
I've heard a lot about both of you.
Well, I hope it was all good.
Very, sir.
Anything specific?
I mean about me in particular.
Oh, please, don't encourage him.
Agent Seaver is on loan to us from the academy
While she's in remedial training with an injury.
Concussion. Hand-to-hand got a little out of control.
How's the other guy?
Don't ask.
I was remediated in the academy also.
Agent Seaver, Dr. Reid.
Um, what was your issue?
What was my issue?
Marksmanship, physical training,
Obstacle course, hogan's alley,
You know, pretty much
everything that wasn't technically book related.
They ultimately had to make exceptions to allow me into the field.
Agent Seaver's going to accompany us to new Mexico.
She is?
As a consultant.
On?
She has a unique perspective.
They don't know?
Well, we weren't sure how you wanted to,
Seaver's not my original last name.
It's my mother's maiden name.
Mine used to be Beauchamp.
My father is charles beauchamp.
As in the Redmond Ripper Charles Beauchamp?
That's him.
He killed 25 women over 10 years
in rural North Dakota.
I think that you caught him, right, Rossi?
Hotch was on that team, too.
Based on her life experience,
We were hoping that agent Seaver
Might recognize something in the family dynamics
inside the community that could be helpful.
We have a plane waiting.
Her father was a serial killer?
That's definitely a different set of parameters.
I don't want her presence to get us sidetracked.
It's a long shot that she's gonna see anything helpful.
We work it like any other case.
You got it.
橡树山
I.D., please.
Agent Hotchner, fbi.
Harvey Brinkman, chief of security for the development.
Nice to meet you.
Detective Ruiz is in the model home.
Park on the right.
Thanks very much.
Well, the fact of the matter is,
"Beam me, up, scotty" Was never actually said.
The closest they ever got was, "Scotty, beam us up"
In "The gamesters of triskelion" And "The savage curtain" Episode,
But interestingly enough
Reid, Reid, come on. Give it a rest.
Detective Ruiz?
That's right.
I'm agent Hotchner.
Call me Felix.
These are agents Morgan and Prentiss.
Dr. Reid, agent Rossi, and agent Seaver.
Thanks for coming.
As your tech requested, we moved everything
From the station right here into the model home.
Thank you.
Agent Prentiss and I would love to take a look around,
Get a feel for the area.
We'd like to see the latest crime scene, too,
If that's possible.
Of course. Let me just get everybody situated
And I'll walk you over there.
Oh, we can find it.
You sure?
Yeah. It's no problem.
They sure aren't the
"Mind your own business" Types, are they?
So how come none of them have seen our unsub?
These are the evidence boards.
As you can see, we're still in the process of moving in.
I didn't think the whole neighborhood needed to see the photos.
You're right.
It's a lot of work, detective. Thank you.
Color-coded and annotated.
Yeah, well, I'm not just the primary detective.
I also live in the community.
Really?
3 blocks right up on the left.
My wife thought it would be an excellent place to raise the kids.
She's changed her opinion in the last couple months.
Yeah, I guess so.
You ok?
Yeah. Let's get to work.
I hope you don't mind,
But I also worked up a cursory profile.
You did?
Yeah. I took an FBI seminar
on serial crime in Albuquerque.
Twice.
Let's see what you've got so far.
All right.
He's organized.
He took everything to the scene, he left nothing behind.
Which means he lives with a spouse
or some kind of long-term partner.
Has a steady, skilled job.
Physically, he presents himself as non-threatening,
but he craves power and control,
so he may have a job or an activity that gives him that.
Not bad.
Unfortunately, I just described
64 of the 71 men who live in the subdivision.
And that is the whole kit and kaboodle on each of your 64 suspects.
Nothing really stands out. They're all pretty plain.
That's pretty much the main issue we're going to have here.
Yeah. Vanilla doesn't make your job any easier.
No, it does not.
So, um, how's it going with the agent whose father was a...
You know?
How'd you know that?
I might have looked into someone's hidden background.
What? I am not gonna let some strange new person
travel with my family and not find out who they are.
Well, she seems fine.
What is that in your voice?
What's what in my voice?
Oh, my god, you think she's pretty.
What? I never said that.
Ho ho, you totally do.
Ha ha! P.G. out, lover boy.
What's all that?
Our technical analyst ran background checks on the suspects.
Oh, I could have given you that.
We typically gather our own intelligence.
Out federal databases tend to have more detailed information.
Well, how do you know
they're more detailed if you haven't seen ours?
It's nothing personal, Chief.
It's just...
You could have asked.
Next time I will.
Has anyone vetted them?
Garcia's doing a separate check
on police and security staff.
Why?
Law enforcement and security
are the kind of jobs that would attract this unsub.
Dennis Rader, BTK, was a compliance officer
in Park City, Kansas.
Kenneth Bianchi, one of the hillside stranglers,
worked as a security guard in California and Washington.
Psychopaths love official jobs
and uniforms.
Where were you the night of the 12th?
Are you saying you think this was me?
Answer the question!
Are you kidding me?
You interviewed every adult male in the community?
More than once. They're all digitized.
Were all the interviews confrontational like this?
Is that wrong?
You didn't get much out of them, did you?
No.
That's when I started thinking maybe I needed some help.
They don't have anything?
After the second woman was killed,
Detective Ruiz said they had evidence.
The police are doing everything they can.
And now you're telling me you have nothing?
You have no idea who did this?
I don't understand how something like this could happen
and no one heard or saw anything.
It's because the kind of person who does this
spends their life practicing.
And what they're good at is getting away with it.
Yeah, well, Aubrey never hurt anybody in her whole life.
I wish I had answers for you.
It's my--my daughter.
I gotta get her out of here.
Everywhere she looks...
Where is she now?
She's in her room.
Do you need to talk to her?
No. That's all right.
Sir, the unsub came through the garage?
Yeah. Detective Ruiz said the remote openers
in this compound only have 5 unique codes.
Well, you'd think they would tell you that
when you moved in, right?
Anyone could just drive around
and open up a fifth of the garage doors.
I usually make sure all the inside doors are locked up,
but Aubrey stayed up late and...
We're very sorry for your loss.
Daddy?
Um, it's, uh, it's my daughter.
Can I...
Yes, of course.
Thanks.
All that stuff you said about BTK and the hillside strangler,
It's all in your head?
I have an eidetic memory.
So you know everything my dad did, then.
I only know what I was told
and what was in the papers.
I don't have a lot of details.
Uh, what sort of details--
Agent seaver.
There's going to be a community meeting tonight.
We're going to all look for visual cues,
But I want you specifically to concentrate on family interactions.
Yes, sir.
Chief. We need to have a place
to hold a town meeting.
Well, there's a church on the east side of the development.
Will you have your men notify residents
that there'll be a meeting there tonight?
Stress that it's important but not compulsory.
Yeah.
Thank you.
6 P.M.
Agent Hotchner.
Sir.
You should see this.
This guy's Frank Morris.
I do? How do I know that?
I run the damn neighborhood watch.
That means you're walking around at night.
Now, the profile could include somebody
in the neighborhood watch, right?
It could. We'd have to know more about his activities.
Exactly. I'll have him brought in.
We're going to try something else.
Can you make some officers available to run a sign-in table
at a community meeting tonight?
One of the things we're going to be examining
is body language in a group environment.
Body language.
It's something that the unsub
won't be able to control
even if he were to try to.
Right. Right.
I'll have some uniforms detailed to the meeting.
Will you also tell Brinkman that the unsub
Will display something that he can't control.
Ok.
You think they'll be able to keep that to themselves?
Let's hope not.
Looks like she was writing a story or something.
Yeah, her husband said she was taking classes.
She wanted to be a novelist.
I want to get this over to Garcia so she can do her thing.
Man, this job.
What we see, all these lives cut short.
I know, Prentiss.
I was just thinking about you.
Baby girl, listen. We got a laptop here
that was owned by the last victim.
I'm gonna hook it up for you over at the model home
so you can work your magic, all right?
What kind of magic?
Well, she was a writer, so maybe she kept a journal?
Maybe she noticed somebody following her
or just felt something weird, I don't know.
So we're fishing.
Yep. Fish away.
Ok. I just so happen to have
a pair of chartreuse waders I never get to wear.
Oh, and, Garcia,
The suspects who are left,
see if any of them have a tech background,
Enough that they would know
how to modify a remote garage door opener.
Done, love you, ciao.
Modify a remote?
Marjorie West's family was out of town.
Jill Long was strangled in her laundry room
while her family was camping outside.
And right here the unsub's able to get through the entire house
only to find a room where somebody was awake?
Does that sound like somebody just randomly checking garage doors
to see if the fifth one will open?
No. That sounds like someone who can open the garage
he specifically needs opened.
Prentiss.
We'll be right there.
Rossi wants us at the church.
They're setting up a community meeting.
Let's go.
We just came from the last victim's house.
The unsub used the garage as access.
Maybe a remote door opener made to be universal.
The police are saying it's random,
but how could you randomly find a woman so vulnerable?
Garcia's going over backgrounds again,
trying to highlight anyone with tech experience.
She's also doing a full workup on Brinkman and Ruiz.
They had that kind of access.
Has anyone seen Ruiz?
I saw him a while ago.
He set up everyone filling out forms,
but I haven't seen him since.
We need to ask for help in a different way.
Tell people that we're looking
for someone who might have seen something
rather than someone who did something.
No one thinks that their friends or neighbors are capable of this.
We should get started.
We're hoping that someone may have seen something
and not even realized it.
Maybe you have a neighbor who takes his trash out late,
works on his car in his garage.
Anything that might put someone outside
at an odd hour
And giving them the opportunity to see something.
Is there anything we can help you look for?
It won't be overt.
The kids probably won't be afraid of dad.
They won't? These guys have explosive tempers, don't they?
Definitely.
Anger wasn't normal at my house.
Usually when it happened, when it exploded,
it was an anomaly. A surprise.
If anything, my father was overly solicitous.
Too nice.
And if I wanted anything...
bicycles, toys, dolls...
all I had to do was ask.
In groups, he always held my hand.
Always.
Sometimes so tight,
it almost cut off the circulation.
But I can never remember him putting me on his lap,
holding me in any way.
Ashley.
And...
he'd always have these talks with me.
He was terrified someone would take me.
Because he knew what was out there.
Yeah, men like him.
You know, maybe this man recently bought gifts for his kids.
My dad used to buy me things all the time.
What kinds of gifts?
Anything.
Everything.
I told you, there was nothing...
My whole life,
There's only one thing I wanted that I couldn't have.
Which was?
A pet.
What have we got?
We're gonna start with the people who didn't show,
Cross-reference with families with no pets.
No pets?
I remembered I wasn't allowed to have a dog
Or a pet of any kind.
It was more than a rule.
It was a big problem for us.
That could be something.
I'm sorry I couldn't point him out.
We don't expect you to point him out.
We're hoping you can help us once we have things narrowed down.
Guys, of the 64 suspects, 18 of them didn't show up.
Ok. Prentiss, take Ashley back to the model home,
Go through the 18 names and add the pet information.
I got it.
Garcia's working on technical backgrounds?
Yes.
Ok, let's get her the 18 names.
And Ruiz never got here?
No. Neither did the security chief.
Ok, as far as I'm concerned, we have 20 no-shows.
That was good stuff
Back there, what you said.
That was helpful.
Was it?
Yeah.
Profiling is a process.
It's about puzzle pieces,
Things that don't look like they fit until they do.
I still don't know how anything I said will be helpful.
Well, you never know.
If we have a subject in interrogation,
Knowing that he's a father
Who's a serial killer who might be overprotective,
That could be the perfect way to get him to talk.
The truth is, I...
I never actually thought about them being fathers at all.
I don't think anyone does.
Is he still alive, your father?
North Dakota does not have the death penalty.
And the answer to your next questions is no,
I have never been to see him.
He writes from time to time, but...
I haven't opened any of the letters.
Do you keep them?
Yes.
Is that wrong?
I don't think there is any right or wrong
When it comes to that.
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
When you catch them,
Do they ever say why?
Do they have an explanation?
Never a good one.
Agent Hotchner?
Yes, sir.
Detective Ruiz would like you to meet him at main and oak.
There's been another murder.
Ok, let's hope the occupancy listings show pets.
This is the pile of suspects we need to weed the 18 from.
What are these?
Victim information, of the families of the 3 women who were killed.
Families.
Yeah, families are the hardest part about this job.
Drew Jacobs. We talked to him this afternoon.
His wife Aubrey was victim number 3.
She's never going to have a mother around.
No.
That was her laptop.
Garcia, our tech, she ran a remote data sweep of it.
We're gonna have to take it back to the house.
Meeting over?
Relax. It's just me.
How'd the meeting go?
We missed you there.
Well, I thought it would be a good time for a sweep, you know,
While everyone was busy.
What are you girls looking for?
Whether or not any of the no-shows have pets.
Pets? Those reports aren't gonna show that.
No?
But I can find out for you.
Got all that information in the security office
At the gate on the south end.
I'll show you.
I'll be back.
I know, Mike. I'm sorry.
We're doing everything we can.
The unsub's killed 2 nights in a row.
It's a major escalation.
We need to start over.
What do you mean?
I think we go back to the beginning.
Local P.D. Gave us a list of 64 out of the 71 possible males.
I think we throw that out and start with the original 71.
What about ruiz?
He's definitely on the list.
Pets, pets, pets.
I know they're in here somewhere.
Maybe I should take a look.
Relax.
Why you gotta be in such a hurry?
'cause we're trying to catch a killer.
Yeah.
Here it is.
Wait.
Yes?
How hard is the background check to get into the FBI?
I got arrested once. It was supposed to be expunged,
But it wasn't.
It was really all just a big misunderstanding.
Oh, well, you know, if it was a misunderstanding...
Really?
No.
Hi. Mr. Jacobs?
Go finish getting ready, Heather. It's ok.
My name is Agent Seaver.
I'm with the FBI.
Well, there were agents here already.
I know.
I brought your wife's computer back.
Thank you.
Sir, the BAU is going to find the man that hurt your wife.
And when they do, you'll probably learn that he has a family.
I'm sorry?
A lot of craziness is going to go on all at once
and the family won't be able to tell you.
They'll be afraid. They won't know how to approach you.
But they'll be very sorry.
They'll wish they could have done something to stop him.
They'll wish things could be different.
They would do anything for things to be different.
I just want to apologize for them.
Would you like to come in?
No, I should get back.
It would just be for a minute.
Heather, my daughter, she's afraid.
It might make her feel better
knowing there's an FBI agent here.
Ok.
Just for a minute.
Hey, Reid,
where's the list of people that didn't make the meeting?
Right here.
We need to look at all 71 files.
We need to eliminate suspects our way, not theirs.
Garcia, I got you?
Fingers at the ready.
What's up?
There are only 67 files here.
Where are the other 4?
Well, one of them's me.
And the other 3 are the victims' husbands.
Why would they automatically be cleared?
Wouldn't they? I mean, if you're gonna check them,
you might as well check me.
We are.
Detective, where are the missing files?
Right over there.
Garcia, we need you to run a few more names.
Phillip Long.
Long has no suspicions on his record, no arrests,
and no technology either.
Drew Jacobs.
This is a really beautiful room.
I don't want to move again.
I know.
But I also know that your father
is doing what he thinks is best for you.
Are you gonna shoot him?
Excuse me?
The guy who hurt my mom.
Do you have a gun?
Heather.
No, it's ok.
I'm sorry.
Not a problem.
Really.
Here.
Thank you, but I really should be getting back.
Can I ask you something?
Of course.
How do you know what the killer's family is thinking?
You said they'll want to apologize?
They will.
They'll be embarrassed
and ashamed...
and really sorry.
But how do you know that?
Drew Jacobs has a couple arrests for assault
when he was younger.
I'll give you more details on that in a sec.
Is this the husband of the woman
whose computer I went through?
She was really unhappy with him.
She said he was distant, he left her alone at night.
Yeah. Wandering around outside.
Outside?
As a matter of fact, before his wife was killed,
he was my top suspect.
How do you...
know...how the killer's family will feel?
We study it in the FBI,
behavior.
We've conducted interviews.
Of killers' families?
Sometimes.
Why would you do that?
Wait, wait. He's an I.T expert
who travels around the world.
He's a tech.
All right, thanks, baby girl.
What's going on?
There was another murder.
What?
During the meeting.
Where's Seaver?
I -- I really need to be getting back out there.
I know, I know. It's just --
this is important to me.
How do you know?
How do you know what his family will think?
I have to get that.
No. - Yes, I --
No.
Yes, I have to.
It's my team.
Agent Seaver.
Ashley, where are you?
Without a doubt, sir.
Where are you?
Yes, sir.
Can you get out of there?
Ashley.
I'm sorry, sir.
I, uh, I can't do that.
Mr. Jacobs told me that his daughter was frightened,
and as soon as I can make her feel better,
I'll come back.
Jacobs has her. She has no gun. Let's go.
Son of a bitch.
That was my boss. He's kind of a pain.
Hmm. What did he want?
He's always checking up on me.
Daddy, no!
Look, mr. Jacobs, wait, no--
Ok.
Shut up!
Please...
Please, don't make her watch.
What?
Your daughter.
You never let her see you angry, right?
Please, don't let her see this.
She will never forget it, mr. Jacobs.
If you let her see this,
She will never forgive you.
Heather, go downstairs.
I don't want to.
It's time to go, Heather.
You don't have to do this, mr. Jacobs.
I'm gonna ask you one more time...
How do you know what the families will think?
My father was like you.
Well, what?
He killed a lot of women before I was a teenager.
His name was Charles Beauchamp
And they called him the Redmond Ripper.
Your father?
He was like you.
He was a serial killer.
Daddy?
Daddy, please.
I know how tired you are.
I know how exhausting your life is.
I watched him live it.
I watched him fight it.
And I saw how desperately he wanted to be different.
Prentiss and Morgan, take the back.
Make noise. Let him know he's caught.
It may be the only chance she's got.
I watched him try so hard to be a good father.
But in the end,
He just couldn't stop the other thing.
FBI! FBI!
Daddy, please, let's just leave.
Go downstairs, Heather.
Please, daddy.
FBI!
FBI!
My father once told me...
The best day of his life
Was the day he got arrested,
Because he could finally stop.
Do you hate him?
Drop the knife.
Daddy!
Drop the knife!
Daddy!
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm so sorry.
You were not supposed to go off on your own.
I know.
You could have been killed.
I know that, too.
Why, Ashley?
You're smarter than that.
I never got to apologize to any of the victims.
The families of the women my father killed.
I thought if I could just apologize to one family
That had been hurt that way...
I'm sorry, that's not good enough.
By making that choice, you put everyone at risk.
When you're in the field,
we are responsible to and for each other.
We are a team.
I won't do it again.
No, you won't.
What else is on your mind?
A dog.
When I was 7 years old,
I found a puppy on my way home from school.
I ran all the way home with this little ball of fur.
I was so excited.
And when I got to the house,
My dad was the only one home.
And I gave him the puppy to hold while I got him some milk.
We didn't have dog food, but I thought, well,
A puppy's like a baby, so milk, right?
And when I got back...
My dad was in the bathroom...
And he turned and told me to put the milk away.
I didn't understand.
And he told me we didn't need the hassle of another mouth to feed
And I was never to do that again.
He tilted his head.
I started crying and I could swear he looked like he was having fun.
He's a psychopath.
Cruelty to animals is part of that.
I know.
But what I don't understand...
Mr. Jacobs asked me a question about my father, and...
I don't hate him.
I don't.
I try, but I just don't.
No matter what else he is,
He's your father.
Now, you're not responsible
for the things he did.
But you can't change the fact that to you...
He's still your dad.
I just feel like he's winning if I don't hate him.
No, kiddo...
There's no winning.
There's just...
Living.
Moving forward.
And if you keep doing that...
You'll be all right.
Is that true?
It is for me.
Thank you.
