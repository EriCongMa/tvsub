nick , what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
sorry , just scoot down .
i need to iron this shirt
that i &apos;m wearing for my date with tran &apos;s granddaughter .
it &apos;s either this or the turtleneck
my mother bought me in 2009 .
they &apos;re my only clean shirts .
the short @-@ sleeved turtleneck ? don &apos;t do that .
okay .
look , we need this whole table
for nadia &apos;s baby shower , all right ? so , move along .
nadia-- isn &apos;t that the russian chick who broke , uh ,
schmidt &apos;s , uh ...
will to live ?
after she broke my penis ?
who saw her and thought ,
&quot; that &apos;s the woman i want to be the mother of my children &quot; ?
she &apos;s not sure .
yeah , she calls it her little &quot; sex party miracle . &quot;
do you have to iron here ?
it &apos;s the only flat surface !
besides winston &apos;s desk-- but he &apos;s using it
to study for his police academy test ,
and he is &quot; not to be disturbed . &quot;
not enough , not enough .
there &apos;s an ironing board in the bathroom .
i know , but i &apos;ve been using that to wedge it between two urinals
to keep schmidt from peeking .
but fine , i &apos;ll use that !
coach ! coach !
my charlie rose episodes , all 18 of them , are gone .
dvr is chockablock filled with
american football matches , which ,
by the way , is a garbage ... oh !
we cool ?
yeah , we cool .
cool .
what the hell just happened ?
fight .
yeah . now it &apos;s over .
i barely even remember it .
i cannot believe you guys handle things that way .
i &apos;m starting to think that neither one of you read
the madeleine albright biography
i gave you for christmas .
i &apos;m so glad we don &apos;t fight .
i know .
oh , please . women fight .
well , we occasionally get into a little thing .
yeah , i mean , like we just had that thing with the purse--
but that was , like , barely even a thing .
yeah .
that was nothing-- i mean ,
there &apos;s no point in even talking about it .
oh . no , you should have that .
no , you should have it .
no , you take it .
no , you take it .
no , you take it .
i want you to take it .
no . take it .
look , i want you to have it
&apos;cause it would look good on you .
no , it &apos;s made for you .
you ...
no .
but then we both decided that it was better
if neither one of us bought it .
yep .
the neon yellow purse ?
with the strap ? yeah , i &apos;ve seen that .
it &apos;s in your closet .
i wonder how many rubber duckies
needed to die to make that thing .
uh , schmidt , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i got to run .
oh ... what ?
thank you so much for helping with the baby shower .
you know , you are just the best .
no , you &apos;re the best .
whoa . did i tell you i love your top , by the way ?
no . oh , i just found this in
the back of my closet .
what &apos;s ... what &apos;s happening ?
you said too much .
so , i &apos;ll call you later ?
definitely .
okay . bye !
bye !
oh , my god !
what just happened ?
that &apos;s a girl fight .
schmidt , stay out of it , man .
girl fights are dangerous , okay ?
i grew up with three sisters ,
and i wore a cup until i was 14 years old .
what &apos;s wrong ?
they planned to wear braids and bows and didn &apos;t tell me
on purpose .
there . now you match .
well , congratulations on having sisters ,
but i know women . you blindfold me ,
spin me around and drop me into a rainstorm ,
and i &apos;ll still find the g @-@ spot .
schmidt ...
let us not forget that i had boobs
for the first 19 years of my life .
i grew up as a fat , asexual friend @-@ zoner .
you can &apos;t buy that kind of access .
schmidt , i &apos;m talking about how women act towards other women .
you don &apos;t want to get in the middle of that .
coach ...
jess has the purse . i saw it in her closet
when it was rainy and i was bored
and i was feeling snoopy .
no , no , no ...
see ?
look-- the purse .
in the immortal words of tag team ,
&quot; whoop . there it is . &quot;
fine . i went back and i bought the purse ,
&apos;cause i love it .
i love purses .
and that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m not a feminist , either .
i &apos;m a damn feminist who loves purses .
where else am i supposed to keep my feminist writings ?
in a purse , that &apos;s where .

《 衰姐们 》 原创者
i don &apos;t know . i ...
jess , it &apos;s a purse . who cares ?
just apologize .
cece and i have been friends for 20 years .
do you know why ?
because we &apos;re passive @-@ aggressive people .
we never confront anything .
that &apos;s the way it works with us . it always has .
and that was one of the worst fights we &apos;ve ever had .
and if i bring up the purse ,
then everything else comes up with it .
too many things have happened .
women have amazing memories .
because we used to be the gatherers ,
and so we had to remember
where all the best berries were hidden .
and cece and i ,
we &apos;ve hidden berries all across the great plains .
colorado , kansas ,
montana ,
nebraska-- need i say more ?
coach gets it .
see , cece and i , we &apos;re gonna be fine ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s gonna play out the way it always does .
we &apos;re not gonna talk for three days ,
and then i &apos;ll surprise her with a latte .
and then we &apos;ll act like nothing happened .
three days without cece ?
do i have to spend three days without cece ?
yes . i don &apos;t trust you around her .
she makes you weak and penis @-@ dumb .
three days without cece ? why don &apos;t you just
replace my shoes with bags and turn me into a lunatic ?
stay out of it , man .
stay the hell out of it , bro .
here &apos;s a different take : why don &apos;t i spend more time with her ?
stay out of it .
i &apos;m confused .
now , should i ... are you asking me
to spend more time with her or stay out of it ?
like , for real ?
i hate this . i hate first dates .
me , too .
i hate all ...
i hate the second ones and the third ones
and the fourth ones .
me , too . yeah . yeah .
i hate dates .
yeah .
the first ones are the worst .
yeah .
this is terrible .
they &apos;re terrible . they &apos;re awkward .
i feel like i &apos;m being weird .
you &apos;re not being weird .
yeah , i am .
i &apos;m the weirdo .
i wanted to do this all night .
that is so stupid .
i hated that i did it .
i feel like i &apos;m being weird , too .
how ?
i don &apos;t know how . just ...
well , now you are .
these sweaters . i got sweater shoulder .
now ... when you do that , it &apos;s very weird .
but before , it wasn &apos;t .
just don &apos;t do sweater shoulder .
please don &apos;t tell tran how bad this is going .
oh , i will .
don &apos;t . it &apos;ll be so embarrassing .
yeah . he &apos;s probably my best friend .
really ?
yes .
you &apos;re not his best friend .
that &apos;s a terrible thing to say .
it &apos;s true .
this is going great .
oh , god , i hate this .
i just want to sit around and do nothing ,
but that is not hot .
that &apos;s hot to me .
you add some sweatpants to that ,
and that is better than porn .
i love porn .
but i like to mute it and come up with my own voices , like ,
&quot; hey , that &apos;s a very interesting mesh cat suit . &quot;
&quot; thank you . it used to be my grandmother &apos;s . &quot;
something like that .
cheers .
that was a weird cheers !
can we go ? !
yes . let &apos;s get out of here . this sucks !
so cute .
yeah , it &apos;s like they &apos;re made for each other .
they haven &apos;t moved in three days .
very weird .
alarming , even .
wait , doesn &apos;t she work or ... ?
shouldn &apos;t you be studying ?
or live somewhere ?
shouldn &apos;t you be studying ?
or have worried loved ones ?
studying ?
coach , this is gonna take some serious
investigative police skills .
but i &apos;m onto her .
i didn &apos;t know girls could be so slovenly .
i did . i have sisters .
oh , my god , we know .
we cool ?
we cool .
oh . just who i was looking for .
hey . how would you like a piping hot latte ?
thanks , jess , but , you know , i , um ...
i can buy my own .
what did you do ?
is this about the socks ?
you weren &apos;t supposed to talk to cece . what happened ?
well , i had to see her .
i can &apos;t go three days without seeing cece .
and it went just like you said it would .
i &apos;m gonna go get the purse .
she played me like john popper plays that
little harmonica and fiddle thing .
ugh ! she &apos;s like a robot scientist .
and you &apos;re like a damn robot .
and usually it &apos;s cute , except when you &apos;re robbing me .
jess , i &apos;m sorry . so ... what @-@ what happens now ?
you bring her another coffee and you guys make up ?
i don &apos;t know what happens now .
we &apos;re in unchartered territory &apos; cause you got involved .
we &apos;re entering the abyss .
it &apos;s like the month i decided not to wear a bra .
those were dark times .
i had no support . literally no support .
cece just texted me a smiley face .
is that bad ?
no , she just texted me the world &apos;s first good smiley face .
i &apos;m gonna text her a yellow heart .
no , uh , yellow heart , whale ,
thumbs up .
well , that seems nice .
how dare she ? chinese man , ballerina , apartment building ?
what does that mean ?
fine !
poop . turban guy . granny .
don &apos;t text her poop .
explosion , monkey @-@ see ? you want to play dirty ? fine .
slice of cake . turtle .
don &apos;t sen ... oh .
double syringe ?
double syringe .

what kind of girl would want me as her sugar daddy ?
only one kind : a homeless woman .
kai is not homeless .
nick , i have been watching her for days now , okay ?
she ... she eats like she doesn &apos;t know
where her next meal is coming from .
she always dresses in layers , tons of layers .
she &apos;s not homeless . her grandfather is tran .
and where does he hang out ?
a park bench .
i think you &apos;re having a nervous breakdown .
i really do .
you &apos;re nuts . you want to avoid studying so much
that you &apos;re making up lies about my new lover friend .
just leave us alone .
maybe you should ... maybe you should give her
our can opener . everybody gives bums cans ,
but they can &apos;t open the cans .
how are they gonna open the cans , nick ?
what are you ...
do you want a blanket ?
i must have fallen asleep reading .

&quot; oh , does coach just think i &apos;m a pretentious poseur
&quot; who just records things to look smart
&quot; because deep down , i am just terrifyingly insecure
about my intelligence ? &quot;
yeah , and girl coach would be , like ,
&quot; does schmidt think that i &apos;m an uncultured meathead
&quot; who has to rewatch football
because i &apos;m afraid of showing anyone my softer side ? &quot;
oh , hey , coach .
aw , hey , you .
