alison ?
did you miss me ?
there &apos;s someone ali is so afraid of , she can &apos;t come back .
and cece &apos;s been busy
running from the cops &apos; cuz she killed wilden .
i &apos;m not waiting here forever ,
and i sure as hell am not going back to rosewood .
what is is ?
i was hoping you could tell me .
i didn &apos;t write it .
you told the police .
but i don &apos;t think i could ever trust you again .
goodbye .
do you think that i had something to do with ali &apos;s murder ?
you &apos;re having a tough time with your withdrawal .
ezra &apos;s not &quot; a. &quot;
he &apos;s a writer , who found
a great opportunity to make a name for himself !
he used us !
i found some stuff out i think can really help you .
ezra thinks that &quot; a &quot; is ali &apos;s mom .
mrs. dilaurentis saw me pick up a shovel and go after ali .
mrs. dilaurentis , we &apos;re not
certain that your daughter &apos;s in that grave .
well , i am .
answer it .
how did you find me ?
look , we want to help you ,
but you need to tell us what happened that night .
then you need to come here .
alison , are you in there ?
what are you doing here ?
spencer !
what ?
stay here .
i &apos;ll be right back .
i cannot believe we let noel bring us here .
do we think she &apos;s even coming ?
i don &apos;t know , when i saw it was him instead of ali ,
i thought for sure this was a trap .
probably is and we &apos;re just sitting here like geese .
ducks .
what ?
you sit like lame ducks . not geese .
ok , well , whatever , they both quack .
geese honk .
why would ali trust noel kahn ?
because he has secrets , too .
i want to hug you and slap you at the same time .
i could use a hug .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here , spencer .
why ? i &apos;m the one you can &apos;t trust .
i need your help .
now that the cops know that i &apos;m not the one they buried ,
they &apos;re gonna start looking again .
and until i know who &quot; a &quot; is , i can &apos;t come home .
ali , we think your mom &apos;s the one
who stole the game from mona .
we think she &apos;s &quot; a. &quot;
you don &apos;t seem surprised .
it &apos;s complicated , em .
i &apos;ve never figured out
the right way to tell you what you need to know .
i &apos;ve never been able to say the words out loud .
why don &apos;t you start at the beginning ?
i &apos;m ready to tell you guys everything .
but if we can &apos;t figure it out tonight ,
i &apos;m gonna have to disappear again .
and this time it &apos;s gonna be for good .
want some coffee ?
did you just get lucky or did someone turn me in ?
who would have done that ?
look , we know wilden was a jerk .
he was on the take and willing
to rough people up to get what he wanted .
maybe he took you out to that lake to scare you .
things got out of hand and
you did what you needed to do to stop him .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
wilden was a jerk .
i thought you might want to help yourself out here .
but we can play it your way .
we also have an eyewitness that can place you at the scene .
we &apos;re just waiting for him to come in to i.d. you .
if i did do it , maybe i had a good reason for it .
i &apos;m gonna need more than coffee
if you want to hear what happened .
we have you on the hook for a murder charge .
if you &apos;re looking to make a deal
i &apos;m not sure what you have to bargain with .
i know who killed that girl .
the one they thought was alison dilaurentis .
what does that have to do with wilden ?
maybe nothing . maybe everything .
you &apos;re the cop . that &apos;s for you to figure out .
so who killed her ?
the same person who &apos;s still trying to hurt my friend .
which friend is that ?
alison . she &apos;s alive .
you &apos;ve seen her ?
more than once . and i can prove it .
so if you want me here to help you figure out who &quot; a &quot; is ,
you must not think i &apos;m the one who hurt you .
let &apos;s not get ahead of ourselves , spencer .
it was a crazy night
and it all starts in hilton head .
&quot; a &quot; had been threatening me since that halloween .
i thought a weekend away with ian would give me a reprieve .
did you follow me here ?
i know who you &apos;re with .
it &apos;s alison .
listen , she doesn &apos;t mean anything to me .
she &apos;s in there , isn &apos;t she ?
you &apos;re with her , now .
melissa--
ian , i know she &apos;s here !
ian , move !
just ... wait ... stop , stop !
please , listen .
just let me take care of this so we don &apos;t make a scene , ok ?
i &apos;m going to handle this !
melissa--
how could you do this ?
you can never see alison again .
fine , ok , i won &apos;t .
because if you do , someone &apos;s gonna get hurt .
&quot; jenna and toby ? &quot;
melissa , you were the one who wanted to take a break .
i &apos;ve just been killing time . waiting for you to come back .
there &apos;s nothing wrong about us .
we &apos;re not even related .
i don &apos;t ever want to lose you again .
you won &apos;t .
i went there to get away from &quot; a , &quot; but when i left ,
i had what i needed to shut &quot; a &quot; down .
those videos changed the game .
jenna was at the top of my list . she had every reason to hate me .
she always had her little dog garrett to do her dirty work .
smile .
i thought you &apos;d see it my way .
oh , and , jenna , if i get one more threat ,
or you ever come back to rosewood , i &apos;ll bury you .
今晚就是你的死期 -a
&quot; bitch can &apos;t see you , but i do .
tonight &apos;s the night i kill you . &quot;
knowing what i had on her , i mean ,
jenna would never have sent that text .
i was wrong .
she wasn &apos;t &quot; a. &quot;
the police are here too , ella .
with a search warrant .
oh , it &apos;s ashley marin .
i &apos;ll call you back if she knows anything . ok .
did you find hanna ?
i spoke to pam .
no one &apos;s seen the girls since the fundraiser .
peter &apos;s coming back from new york .
get this into evidence .
let &apos;s regroup when he gets here .
ok . bye .
if you let me know what you &apos;re looking for
maybe i can help you find it .
we appreciate your cooperation .
i want to know where my daughter is .
so do i.
what is it you think these girls are guilty of ?
i &apos;m not sure they &apos;re guilty of anything ,
but we do have probable cause to believe
they know the whereabouts of a missing person .
this was taken a few weeks ago .
oh , my god . alison is alive ?
spencer ?
surprise !
so when you got the text
you just crossed jenna off your list ?
and when i got home ,
&quot; a &quot; made it clear that if she wanted to kill me , she could .
i wasn &apos;t safe anywhere .
but i finally had a weapon to fight back .
i realized that everyone i suspected ...
... even the four of you ,
were somehow compromised on those videos .
how could this happen ?
i don &apos;t understand .
i don &apos;t want you going out tonight .
it &apos;s the last weekend of summer .
it &apos;s not a discussion .
we planned this ages ago , and you said it was ok .
ali , now is not the time--
you have to send somebody . immediately .
is this about you thinking spencer &apos;s the bully ?
because , i have that under control now .
i know things about that family that you don &apos;t .
really , like what ?
i &apos;ve seen what they &apos;re capable of .
and you have to remember .
you can never turn your back on a hastings .
for once in your life please don &apos;t push me on this .
call it a night , go upstairs to your room .
yes ?
and is there any news ?
please hurry , i &apos;m very , very worried .
please send someone .
i see .
yes . yes !
of course .
gotcha !
that &apos;s so not funny , alison .
i got you hilarious girls , so ...
ali , did you download the new beyonce ?
not yet .
i &apos;m loving her new video .
maybe a little too much , em .
bad , huh ?
your turn .
careful , aria .
take too much and you &apos;ll tell us all your secrets .
friends share secrets . that &apos;s what keeps us close .
drink up .
what do you want , toby ?
i can &apos;t believe you drugged us .
if i got another &quot; a &quot; threat while you guys were asleep ,
i could cross you off the list .
i can &apos;t believe we were suspects .
i wasn &apos;t always the best friend to you guys .
yeah , well , your plan didn &apos;t work .
i didn &apos;t sleep through the night .
wait for it , spencer . we &apos;ll get there .
so you work here ?
the owner travels a lot .
i watch his place upstairs when he &apos;s gone .
toby told me he wanted you to know you did him a favor .
he said he was free at last .
i know what you see in toby , spencer .
when he tells you the truth , you believe him .
he said his time in juvie got him away from jenna ,
and he was actually grateful to me .
that &apos;s how i knew he wasn &apos;t &quot; a. &quot;
and it was the last time i saw him .
在接吻石见
did we have a date that i forgot ?
you lied to me .
i have somewhere to be .
no !
you &apos;re not going anywhere .
you said spencer was as away for a few days last week .
was she visiting family ? or a friend ?
are you questioning all the girls &apos; parents ?
we &apos;re doing everything we can to find your daughters .
you &apos;re free to leave whenever you like .
but you should know there &apos;s a sea of reporters out there .
you probably want to wait here until we can clear a path for you .
fine , but i &apos;d like to call my husband .
i &apos;m not sure what &apos;s taking him so long .
i &apos;ll give you some privacy .
i got the warrant to track
the gps on the girls &apos; phones and spencer &apos;s car .
we &apos;ll have their location within the hour .
good , keep me posted .
i &apos;ve always looked out for my sister .
so when i ran into her boyfriend in london ,
and he said she missed me , i decided to come home .
miss hastings , do you mind if i record this ?
i should probably ask my mom about that .
your wife is on her way .
she knows i &apos;m here , right ?
she has got enough to worry about with spencer missing .
do you have any idea where your daughter is ?
if i did , would i be sitting here talking with you ?
is that something they taught you in law school ?
to answer questions with questions ?
you &apos;re not a parent , are you ?
see , the only reason i &apos;m talking to you
is because my daughter is missing .
so why don &apos;t you tell me what you &apos;re doing to find her .
you &apos;ve got cash , a passport , and a plane ticket .
we need to leave for the airport in an hour .
thank you .
you guys , we can &apos;t let her leave , again .
then we have to put together the pieces .
tonight .
ali ... look i understand we &apos;re here to figure out who &quot; a &quot; is ,
but i need to know if ezra told me the truth .
ezra seemed to get that everything i said was made @-@ up stuff .
but he believed me when i said that cece and i
were roommates at upenn .
we hung out a lot at this pub near hollis .
that &apos;s where i met ezra .
excuse me , can i have a gin and tonic ?
thanks .
it &apos;s tragic , isn &apos;t it ?
oh , sorry ?
the book . it &apos;s one of my favorites .
i read it every summer .
i just finished it for the third time .
what &apos;s better to read the tender is the night
while you &apos;re sunning in the french riviera ?
do people still do that ?
do what ?
go sunning in the french riviera ?
i don &apos;t know . i made it up .
so , you &apos;re a bit of a fabulist .
what does that mean ?
a teller of tales .
sometimes lies are more interesting than the truth .
he said i reminded him of
holly golightly in breakfast at tiffany &apos;s .
he wanted to write a story about me .
do we need to hear the rest of this ?
i thought it was a compliment
because audrey hepburn played her in the movie ,
but turns out she was a big phony
who couldn &apos;t even name her cat .
she didn &apos;t name her cat because
she didn &apos;t think she deserved to be loved .
they were just a couple of poor no @-@ name slobs .
i &apos;m sorry , aria .
for what ?
everything .
look , it is one thing to
make up stories about how you spent your summer ,
but to lie to a guy and say that you &apos;re 21,
when you &apos;re still in high school--
what &apos;s the big deal ? we didn &apos;t do anything , ezra .
that &apos;s not the point .
then what are you so freaked out about ?
god help me , alison , i actually like you .
i just don &apos;t want to see you get hurt .
you &apos;re an all right guy .
see you around .
no . you won &apos;t .
if you ever get your story published ,
you better spell my name right .
and then i walked to the kissing rock to see ian .
thanks for meeting me . that was some goodbye kiss .
no hard feelings , right ?
please . this was just me killing time ,
while i &apos;m waiting for someone better to come along .
look ... why don &apos;t we just end this
on a positive note , ok ?
you and melissa deserve each other . she &apos;s such a bitch .
hey , watch your mouth .
and you &apos;re going to jail .
you know , we never had sex , alison .
so , i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
i saw your home movies , ian .
what does n.a.t. stand for anyway ? need a therapist ?
listen , you are not gonna blackmail me into staying with you .
that &apos;s hilarious . this isn &apos;t about you .
someone &apos;s threatening me . and if it &apos;s you ,
or your crazy girlfriend , it stops tonight .
because i &apos;ve made a copy of every single video on your laptop .
if i get one more text or stupid doll ,
you &apos;re going to be buying your soap on a rope .
you have no idea how much trouble you &apos;re going to be in ,
if you show those videos to anyone .
look at me !
there are things on here that could bring everybody down .
including your family .
well , i guess you better go back to that posse of pervs
and tell them to leave me alone .
ian was more freaked out than i thought he was going to be .
i mean , he took off out of there like a plucked peacock .
geez , hanna !
sorry .
aria , you ok ?
yeah .
ezra &apos;s still looking for me , aria .
but it &apos;s not about the book now , it &apos;s about you .
what would you know about that ?
he found shana in georgia .
he knows that we were in touch , and he offered to help .
he thinks if he saves me , he &apos;ll win you back .
do you even want to be saved ?
i know how i treated people .
i deserved a lot of what i got .
i think i deserve a second chance .
what happened after ian left ?
i went back to the barn .
i &apos;ve been waiting for you .
would you see if my wife is here , please ?
absolutely . just one more thing , though .
why did you hire a private detective
the summer alison went missing ?
it was business related .
you sure it wasn &apos;t spencer related ?
her name is all over the file he gave you .
i thought this was about finding spencer ,
not accusing her of something .
in hindsight you knew it was the drugs ,
that must have been a rough summer .
with spencer &apos;s erratic behavior and violent outbursts .
ok , we &apos;re done here . i &apos;m calling my attorney .
cell reception &apos;s better in the lobby .
we have all of our resources committed to finding your daughter .
we should have more information for you soon .
thank you .
we got a lock on spencer &apos;s gps . the girls are in philadelphia .
get philly pd on the phone .
i &apos;ll be right back .
jessica ?
police are asking pointed questions about spencer .
do we still have an understanding ?
i just found out that my daughter is still alive , peter .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m thinking about right now .
mrs. dilaurentis , can we talk to you ?
dad ?
melissa ? what are you doing here ?
toby came to london .
he told me about spencer &apos;s relapse .
dad , what &apos;s going on ?
where is your mother ?
we &apos;ve been here for an hour .
they asked to talk to us separately .
god , they know .
i must have missed something .
i did everything i could to protect her .
oh , my god .
dad , you think she did it ?
you think spencer killed that girl .
i ... i remember bits and pieces .
but i &apos;m not sure what &apos;s real and what i &apos;ve made up .
i was pushing all summer for you to tell melissa about ian
because i wanted to break them up .
i thought that ian actually liked me
and that melissa was in the way .
and we got in a fight in the kitchen . and it got ugly .
it was like you bottled up every fight we ever had
and popped your top that night .
i thought that you were still threatening me .
i told you i would tell melissa the truth .
and i told you to forget it ,
but you were holding on to it like a dog with a bone .
hey , this conversation isn &apos;t over !
it is over , spencer . and so are we .
don &apos;t you walk away from me .
damn it , alison . i said , stop !
you &apos;re way out of your league , spencer .
am i ? you sure about that ?
why don &apos;t you put that thing down before you hurt yourself ?
are you speeding ?
when i saw the pills , i put it together .
you weren &apos;t asleep because you were wired .
spencer .
spencer !
spencer ... spencer , wait !
what ? !
please don &apos;t tell anybody .
please look , i &apos;ll do anything , ok .
i &apos;ll get down on my hands and knees .
i &apos;ll beg you if that &apos;s what you want me to .
please !
stop .
spencer , look at me .
don &apos;t take any more of these tonight , ok ?
and never take them with alcohol .
if my parents find out--
they won &apos;t .
it &apos;ll be our secret .
thank you .
that &apos;s what friends are for .
go back and just sleep it off , ok ?
and after that there was just one more person i needed to see .
your dad , aria .
you know how much it will hurt aria if you make that call .
i don &apos;t think that you &apos;re that horrible of a person .
well , then you clearly don &apos;t know me that well .
i didn &apos;t think byron was &quot; a. &quot;
but i needed him to know that i had the tapes .
then i went back to the barn and waited for another text .
nothing came .
i went home thinking i won . i silenced &quot; a. &quot;
it wasn &apos;t you , spencer .
you were sound asleep when i left the barn .
yeah , but ... that doesn &apos;t mean i didn &apos;t hurt the other girl .
you &apos;re not listening , spence . you went back to sleep .
i didn &apos;t do it .
but your mom saw who did .
why didn &apos;t she tell the police ?
i could hear her talking to someone .
she thought i was dead .
i was trying to tell her i was alive .
i was screaming .
&quot; can &apos;t you see me ?
can &apos;t you see me breathing ? look at me ! &quot;
but the words didn &apos;t come out . i couldn &apos;t move .
ali , we &apos;re here for you . all right , we &apos;re all here for you .
and we always have been . you should have told us .
you didn &apos;t have to keep this a secret .
god , i can &apos;t believe your mom buried you alive .
are you sure she thought you were dead ?
she was hysterical .
she kept saying the same thing , over and over again .
&quot; what have you done ? what have you done ? &quot;
who was she talking to ?
the person she &apos;s still protecting .
that &apos;s why she was pointing the finger at me
because she &apos;s still covering for somebody .
yeah , but who ?
was mrs. grunwald telling the truth
when she said she pulled you out of there ?
she took me to the hospital .
i was so scared , so i ran .
i didn &apos;t know where i was going . i just knew i had to go .
alison ?
oh , my god . are you ok ?
i still can &apos;t believe somebody tried to kill you .
nobody followed us , right ? they can &apos;t know that we &apos;re here .
i registered with the name you told me to use .
vivian darkbloom .
i &apos;m scared for you , alison .
i &apos;m scared for me , too .
if this &quot; a &quot; person
who &apos;s after you was willing to bash your head in ,
what &apos;s stopping them from trying again ?
nothing .
maybe you should die .
what ?
let &quot; a &quot; think you &apos;re dead .
how do i do that ?
you disappear .
you should rest .
come on . i got you .
there you go .
everything &apos;s going to work out
exactly the way it &apos;s supposed to . you &apos;ll see .
i &apos;ll take care of you .
pretty girl .
did i get everything you need ?
ali ?
you saved my life , mona .
i don &apos;t know how i can thank you .
thank me by staying gone . and staying safe .
come here .
look at yourself .
ditch the glasses and the barrettes .
have kim at the salon do your hair
and ask for cindy at the make @-@ up counter .
buy everything she tells you to
and never go to school without your face on .
now , burn those knee socks ,
tell mandi at the boutique that vivian sent you .
you don &apos;t have to be a loser , mona .
thanks , ali .
mona played me like a fool . and she got exactly what she wanted .
mom &apos;s talking to sandra king .
she &apos;s the best criminal defense lawyer in the state .
dad , spencer didn &apos;t kill that girl .
thank you , sandra , i appreciate it .
mrs. hastings , we just heard from the philadelphia police .
they &apos;re only a few minutes away .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to figure this out tonight .
but you shouldn &apos;t leave , ali .
we know everything now . we can protect you .
we know everything except who &quot; a &quot; is .
but if the five ... if we stick together--
i can &apos;t go back until i figure out
why my mom was willing to do that to me .
ali , come on , you can &apos;t leave .
don &apos;t you want to come home ?
it was surprisingly easy for me to stay gone .
until you got hurt , hanna .
i was so scared that you were going to die .
it was worth the risk .
when i saw you in the hospital ...
when i saw what mona did to you ...
... i decided to stop running .
i tried to keep one step ahead of &quot; a , &quot;
and i did everything i could to keep you safe .
please . if you love my sister you won &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m doing it because i love her .
what are you doing here ?
ian wasn &apos;t dead . i was waiting in the back and i saw him .
were you at the lodge the night of the fire ?
i helped you , hanna . by the time i got there ,
the rest of you were already safe .
did you see who pulled us out ?
guys , i think someone &apos;s out there .
is that noel ?
get the plate number ?
we have an 11 @-@ 57 on the hastings vehicle
but the suspects are not at the scene .
i repeat , the suspects are not at the scene .
ali , run !
go !
oh , my god !
lock the door !
call 911 !
noel has our phones !
fire escape ! fire escape !
hurry !
get out of here .
oh , my god !
he &apos;s right behind us !
hurry !
it &apos;s locked !
there &apos;s no way out of here .
do you think we can make it ?
no !
ezra ?
hey , hey ! hey .
look , i know who you are . and the police are on their way .
ezra !
oh , my god .
take off your mask !
now !
take it off !
no !
there &apos;s no way that &apos;s your mom .
ezra ?
it &apos;s so beautiful .
no ! no ...
oh , my god . oh , my ...
oh , my god ! ezra !
i &apos;m sorry ...
shhh . don &apos;t .
you stay awake , do you hear me ? don &apos;t you dare close your eyes !
no , please ! ezra !
somebody call for help !
oh , my god . ezra ! ezra !
oh , my god !
