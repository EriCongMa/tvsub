19-year-old Kate Joyce an honour student
was vacationing at beach with friends
When she disappeared nearly 3 days ago.
Atlantic Beach detective Bob Mathias...
They've had suspects in custody the whole time but nothing.
Can't even charge them with anything unless they find her body.
What are the chances of that?
...but are cooperating with the investigation.
Mathias says without a body...
They're still in Hotch's office huh?
It can't be good.
...are suspected in her disappearance.
Authorities only have 12 hours left
To hold the men in custody without an official charge.
JJ's still in there?
And Strauss.
Oh again with the dairy?
I can't help it. I love dairy.
It's been like what 20 minutes?
Well 10 more minutes we're in the air.
I don't think it's about the case.
Do you know something?
Do I know something?
She just repeated the question.You always say that's a sign.
Do you know why JJ's in there?
I have no idea.
What is going on?
Maybe she asked for a raise.
Have his blinds ever been closed?
I have given it thought. I'm not interested.
Clearly. You turned down the job twice
Without consulting your unit chief.
Agent Jareau is under no obligation to discuss it with me.
If the Pentagon calls one of your team members
You should know about it.
Why didn't you tell Agent Hotchner
That you turned down the position?
I never wanted it to get this far because--
Because you know it's a better job.
Because I don't want to leave this one.
You've been here for 6 years.
Nearly 7 ma'am.
Change is good.
And from what I understand there's less travel with this position.
You could stay home with Henry.
Excuse me?
I understand the sacrifices.
I do what I love.
It's made me a better person a better mother.
Any "Sacrifices" I have made
have been for my family.
I don't have a single regret.
We're all in agreement that Agent Jareau's
A valuable part of this team
And it's understandable why the executive branch
Is requesting a transfer.
However if Agent Jareau respectfully declines their request
There's no way you can make her go.
No I can't.
Have you looked at the video of the missing girl?
Everyone's watching it now.
You're expected in Maryland within the hour.
We'll be there.
Thank you.
JJ.
Pentagon?
Sorry I didn't tell you.
It's ok. It's just-- it's a big deal.
A liaison for the Department of Defense--
It's a major promotion.
Are you sure you don't want this?
Hotch I belong here.
You'd think profilers would cover better than that wouldn't you?
You read up on the suspects?
Presents like the typical dominant-submissive
But I doubt it's that textbook.
Well we only got one shot at this.
How long have they been in custody?
60 hours. We have 12 hours to get a confession or find the body.
Syd Pearson has a lot of money and connections.
If we let him go we may never see him again.
And Barrett?
He doesn't have the same resources.
Do you think these guys did it?
The locals do.
They tried to get them to turn against one another
But that didn't work.
It seems they have a bond that dates back to childhood.
We only have a 30-minute flight.
That's not enough time to delve into their histories.
Bullet points on the missing woman.
Second and third pages are all about the suspects.
Garcia we're gonna need phone records credit card receipts
Anything you can find.
Yes you'll have them when you get there.
Thank you.
Is everything ok?
What you mean Strauss? Don't!
I know that look. Everything is gonna be fine.
Jean Racine said
"A tragedy need not have blood and death.
It's enough that it all be filled with that majestic sadness
That is the pleasure of tragedy."
Hey you ok?
Uh yeah. You?
I just feel kind of sick. Excuse me.
I got this offer from the Pentagon.I turned it down twice.
I never told Hotch or Strauss.
And now Strauss wants you to take it.
Well of course she does.
It'll make her look good if you get promoted.
I don't trust her for a second.
You shouldn't. What does Hotch think?
He knows I don't want to go.
Well then you won't.
Penelope's pretty freaked out huh?
You have to ask?
Ok let's review.
Ok. Kate Joyce 19 years old
Was last seen leaving a bar with these two men
Sydney Pearson and James Barrett both 20 years old.
She was reported missing the next morning.
when she didn't make it to meet her friend.
That was almost 3 days ago.
Their story is they dropped Kate at the motel
But there were no cameras to confirm that.
And search and rescue's been all over the island.
Dragged the inlet and they found absolutely nothing.
Both said they had sex with Kate.
They're claiming it was consensual.
There's no way to confirm. There's no body.
I doubt it was consensual.
We've got to prove they're guilty
Of more than just being seen with her.
The police weren't able to find any holes in their stories.
We're gonna have to break them down psychologically.
Morgan I want you and Prentiss to lead the interrogation.
Dave you and Reid start at the bar.
JJ Kate Joyce's family is still at the station.
Still? For 3 days?
They never went to the hotel.
I want you to stay with them.
Yeah.
They haven't left.
The mayor personally set them up
With a penthouse suite at the Harrison Grand
But they won't go.
They can't. You're their only source of information.
To be even a minute away would add to their torture.
I've kept them away from the suspects.
Now I don't get why you want them together.
Trust me.
You're from the FBI?
Yes ma'am. Jennifer jareau.
Jj?
Kate was almost Jennifer.
Jennifer Joyce. We would have called her JJ.
Would you two like to head to the hotel?
I'll come with you.
We'll have constant contact with my team.
Will those boys still be here?
Yes sir.
Then so will I.
Ok well let's find a place where we can talk.
Come on.
Hit the national news yesterday.
A lot of pressure.
The mayor would rather have a great white attacking
Than a homicide.
Sure. A shark attack makes the mayor a victim.
A killer makes him responsible.
Once she got into that car
We have no idea what happened.
Well the suspects' stories hold up.
They've told them dozens of times without variation.
There's got to be some truth in them.
Syd Pearson is a handful.
Jimmy Barrett is dumber than a box full of rocks.
But they've been friends all their lives.
Yeah go figure.
There's gotta be a reason.
Well they've only been out of their holding cells
to be interrogated or to use the john.
You've got video?
Yeah we got cameras in both rooms.
Good. We'll have to rely on nonverbal cues.
That'll expose their weaknesses.
Hey you.
What'd you do with kate?
Calm down man.
I will kill you you understand?
You understand me?!
Keep them him from me.
Barrett avoided conflict.
Pearson was provocative.
The blond one's getting off on this.
Well if he knows where kate is
that's his power.
Hey can I get you anything?
What?
Water? Soda? Are you hungry?
Starving.
Anything.
Tuggie's roast beef with fries.
The curly ones.
You got it.
And a beer.
Nice try.
What the hell was that?
Just trying to establish some trust.
You gonna ask the other one too?
No.
In other words you're not going in there.
Not yet.
Really?
You know we don't have a whole lot of time here.
They've been slammed with
the same questions for the last 2 and 1/2 days.
We go in there with that strategy we'll get nowhere.
I don't get it.
If we go in there now they have all the power.
So what we just wait?
For a while.
Kate Joyce comes from a stable family.
She went to good schools got good grades
Has good friends.
Everything points to her being a total sweetheart.
You don't think she is?
I'm sure she is.
But?
She's 19.
Everyone agrees--
kate wouldn't leave with those boys.
But she did.
Yeah. But why?
Why would this girl this sweetheart
Take such a risk?
We don't have many images to go by.
We saw enough to know what happened.
Kate Joyce and her friends moved around a lot.
The suspects didn't.
They waited for her.
A sea of opportunity.
Why was she drawn to those guys?
What if she knew them?
Her friends never said that.
She was only here a week.
I think she trusted them.
Why?
She may have been testing her boundaries
But she's far too cautious to just go off with total strangers.
So she met them before Friday night.
Look at her.
Has she always been a fish?
We started her out in swim lessons
Our second summer down here.
When was that Jeff '95?
Who's this? Your son?
Drew.
So they were on the same swim team
But he looks like he's a few years younger?
Was. He had leukemia.
I'm so sorry.
Katie was always very protective of him.
It hit her the hardest.
We should have been here. If we had driven down...
Then she wouldn't have come.
Stop saying that.
It's the truth. The whole point
Was for her to get away.
Get away?
From what Patty? From us?
I don't know Jeff.
She needed a break.
You shouldn't have let her come.
She's 19 years old.
How was I gonna stop her?
And we said it was ok.
We were wrong.
God don't you think I know that?!
I know you're trying to make sense of this.
Trust me there is no logic to any of it.
No. You have no idea
No idea what it's like.
Our children were taken from us!
And there is nothing you can say
That will change that.
You're right.
It's natural to want to blame someone.
But right now you really have to hold on to each other.
Garcia what have you got?
Oodles of records.
Cell phones credit cards
Some juicy juvie.
Sending details now.
It is safe to say these two have always been in trouble.
When did it start?
The summer of 2000.
They were only 10. What did they do?
See for yourself.
Naughty boys.
Shoplifting vandalism
Burned a house down.
Abandoned building. Fireworks.
Assault charges were dropped last summer.
Well it looks like they bring out the worst in each other.
Ready?
What's up?
What's up?
My name's Derek Morgan.
I'm with the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit.
What did you do?
Oh I had this before Friday night.
That's not what I asked you.
But I know what you're thinking.
I highly doubt that.
Wow. Division one lacrosse player.
Obviously left-handed.
Broke it in 3 places.
Ooh. That sucks.
I bet you're a force.
Too bad you didn't dominate the way they hoped though.
Why not?
I mean what happened?
Were you still hung up on the Chapel Hill rejection?
I mean especially after you told everybody that you were gonna go.
I mean damn that's gotta sting a little bit.
What's the deal?
Isn't it all in your little file?
Well let's see.
My little file says...
you cheated on your SATs
and you had your girlfriend take them for you.
That's another hard lesson isn't it?
You can't trust anybody to keep their mouth shut.
Why haven't you lawyered up?
I haven't done anything wrong.
That is so annoying.
Do you know anything about video cameras?
The battery's probably dead.
Oh.
Hey guys. Can I get a new uh
battery for the video camera?
Ok.
What is that roast beef?
Did anyone ask you?
I'm not hungry.
Neither was I until I smelled that.
Sorry.
OK. Um...
So Syd has a lexus.
That's nice.
Did he ever let you drive it?
No.
Yeah he's kind of a control freak huh?
I met him. He seems like a jerk.
And it says a lot that he can eat at a time like this.
And he didn't just get a car.
He got a lexus.
At 16.
But well I guess that's what LRBs get.
Little rich boys.
His dad's got a dealership.
Do you always defend Syd?
Defend him?
Never mind.
So I see you have a boat.
Single outboard motor two-stroke engine.
Is it fast?
Yeah.
25...
30.
So when did your family move here?
I don't remember.
Grade school? Middle school?
Fifth grade.
So you were 10.
That's the year you met Syd.
How does any of this have to do with that girl?
He never mentions her by name.
Why not?
He's distancing himself.
Depersonalizing the victim.
You want to talk about Kate?
I didn't know her.
You brought her up.
See the way he shifted his weight and cracked his neck?
His behavior was consistent until Kate was mentioned.
Your statement says that you and Jimmy first met Kate
on Friday night.
These are Kate's credit card receipts.
Her and her friends rented a jet ski
from Jimmy Friday morning.
Mm-hmm. He gets 100 customers a day.
Yeah but come on man.
I doubt they all look like Kate now do they?
Isn't that really why Jimmy texted you Friday morning?
Woke you up and said hey man
you gotta get down here and see this girl.
And you liked what you saw didn't you?
You invite her to the club
and maybe that would have been all right but the problem is
when you and Jimmy get together it's nothing but trouble.
And when you add a girl to that mix
she didn't stand a chance did she?
Just like Kelley Graybeal.
Who?
Last summer.
She filed a complaint but lucky for you
she dropped all the charges.
Look man we could do this for another
I don't know whatever you got left.
Or I could make it...
real simple for you.
Give me a polygraph.
After 65 hours of sitting in here you want a polygraph?
Well that depends.
On what?
Are you gonna ask me the questions?
'cause I was really hoping
You'd send that pretty one back in here.
You guys hear that?
Barrett just asked for a polygraph.
You're kidding me. Him too?
I don't understand why those boys agreed to a polygraph.
They didn't. They suggested it.
It's a countermeasure. They're trying to manage perceptions
trying to prove they don't have anything to hide.
They know where Kate is right now.
Well we don't know that for sure.
All right um...
Why don't we head to the hotel ok?
We could go and look at the ocean.
I can't believe you're thinking about a view right now.
I'm not.
You just said.
Because it calms you.
Ok you guys haven't been outside for days.
You haven't eaten. You haven't slept.
You cannot keep going like this.
You go ahead.
We think Kate was comfortable with these guys.
How? Their only other encounter was
at the jet ski rental.
The only documented encounter.
Garcia's running her friends' credit cards too.
They could have met someplace else.
I don't know. She's a smart girl.
Well they're handsome charming 19.
You remember 19?
She would know better than to be outnumbered.
What if Pearson promised to dump Jim Barrett?
And what Jim retaliated?
I could work that theory.
When do we get the results?
Any minute.
So what if they didn't do it?
Then we're back to nothing?
One of them knows where Kate is.
How can you be sure?
Because an innocent person doesn't sit quietly for 3 days.
They get angry and defensive.
These guys are going out of their way to appear calm and in control.
They've got something to hide.
Then why take the polygraph?
'cause they're stalling.
Serial killers are kings of manipulation.
Serial killers? Uh there's only one potential victim.
Serial killing is a qualitative characteristic.
It not just about numbers.
They've assaulted at least one girl before.
It was only a matter of time before they did it again.
Barrett's a perfect match for Pearson.
His family uprooted from the city
forcing him to adapt to his new surroundings.
He's eager to fit in and quick to follow.
And Pearson's definitely got the dominant traits.
He's loud he's physical he's smart
he's charismatic and he's privileged.
Sounds like a peach.
You should talk to him.
Love to.
I'll take you to him.
JJ how are the Joyces doing?
They lost their son 3 years ago.
If we can't find Kate...
If Kate knew these boys better than we thought
you might want to dig a little.
Dig?
If the family thinks it could help they may reveal something.
I know. It's just...
they shouldn't have to.
Hotch we can't lose her.
Strauss thinks we're all replaceable.
I went over her head to try to explain that we're not.
Are you the bad cop?
I'm not a cop.
Sydney Xavier Pearson.
A name like that didn't come with manners?
A gentleman walks a lady to the door.
She wasn't much of a lady.
Watch your mouth.
The girl was horny man.
I mean she practically begged me for it.
The son of a bitch passed. That's a bunch of bull--
How?
How'd you do it?
Bastard believes his lies are the truth.
Takes a few deep breaths and passes.
Old-timer's kind of dramatic isn't he?
You know it's actually much simpler than that.
You see uh
I didn't actually do anything to her.
You didn't do anything? You gave me some pretty graphic details.
Oh don't get me wrong.
My DNA is... all over that girl but uh
that doesn't mean I killed her.
I got pictures.
What?
On my cell.
You want to see?
You're giving us consent?
Give me this guy's property! Now!
What the hell was that?
That was the camera.
No the yelling.
That was agent Morgan.
Barrett it says here you were half an hour late
to work on saturday morning.
I was hung-over.
Hung-over? That's nothing new
but being late is.
It looks like you always clock in 10 minutes early
gas up the jet skis get the life vests out.
What happened that morning?
I just told you. I was hung-over.
Got you. Hung-over
Slept in.
What about friday night
friday after the bar?
We drove to the inlet.
Drove to the inlet.
Approximately what time would you say you drove to the inlet?
2:00.2:30.
Why would you go to the water at 2:00 or 2:30 in the morning?
The boats start coming in.
In the middle of the night the boats start coming in?
Yeah. They fish all night
then they bring in the catch.
Then they sell it on the docks
to the restaurants and all that.
Syd wanted to show her then he drove her back
dropped her off at the hotel
and the next thing I know it's morning.
And you slept in?
My alarm clock's broken.
Broken. Your alarm clock's broken?
Broken.
Did it make you upset?
Can you fix the damn camera please?!
Sit down.
How'd you pass it?
Now a gentleman never shares
but...
See?
No tears.
Now you see how happy she was?
Did Kate drink often?
I told you she's an athlete.
Were you surprised she had a fake I.D.?
It's no secret. She liked going out with her friends.
Why are you doing this?
I'm not judging Kate.
I want to find her.
What time is it?
7:30.
It's almost dark out.
We can't do this anymore. Please just find her.
Where is she?
I don't know.
Where is Kate Joyce?
You got a hair or something?
You know what I don't get it Rossi
what I just can't wrap my brain around?
No what's that?
How this could have been consensual.
Don't sit down. Don't sit down.
Consensual huh?
What does that look like?
How do you get a nice girl like Kate
to do both of you in the same night?
She liked it.
What did she like?
What did she do both of you at once?
Come on you know that.
Did you take turns?
What?
I mean you said she liked it.
But what? What did she like?
You know man.
No I don't.
Is this what you did to her? Hmm?
You pin her down?
I told you she liked it.
You held her just like this.
You choked her.
Well how long before she tapped out?
This is exactly what you did to her.
You know what I think syd?
I think kate didn't want to fool around with your friend.
So she begged you to take her home.
But you couldn't diss your boy like that could you?
So you helped him.
Pinned her down in the backseat.
Maybe you threw her out in the dirt.
Maybe you hit her too hard
She stopped breathing
You were stuck weren't you?
It's not true.
Is that what you mean by consensual?
They sure know how to run out the clock.
Yeah. What have we got?
Less than 3 hours.
What do you think?
Well he's not smart enough to have done this by himself.
He's always been a follower.
Pearson's charming enough to pick up a good girl
But barrett was just along for the ride.
Take a look at the photos.
Oh she wasn't interested in barrett at all.
But he's the one she met in the morning.
All right. Well I'll keep pushing.
How's it going in there?
I wouldn't be surprised
if morgan turned off the camera in a minute.
I told you agent jareau's transfer
Is an executive decision.
Ma'am I'm asking you not to take it out on Agent Jareau
Because I went over your head.
I know this is emotional for you--
It's not emotional.
It's a bad decision. She's a vital member of our team.
I'm afraid it's a done deal.
That's unacceptable.
Well what do you want me to do aaron
Lose my job so she can keep hers?
And I have no say in this?
You don't get it.
They're not asking you.
They want her back in D.C. Now.
What do you think?
I don't know.
This kid's got no shame.
No guilt.
He did horrible things to kate but...
I don't think he killed her.
So what are we saying? The only thing he's guilty of
Is being a scumbag?
Any official charge for that?
The storm came through and separated the land.
That's what made the inlet.
Huh.
One thing you can trust is the ground beneath you
Until one day it all just shifts.
Is that some kind of a metaphor?
You tell me.
It sounds like you're just trying to make some fancy point.
That's all.
He's smarter than you thought.
He never says the word water.
He always talks about the inlet.
Well he's a local kid. He knows the specifics about the island.
He's getting sloppy.
You think it's all an act?
Barrett's never said her name.
He's fidgety looks like he's a submissive
But he's not entirely weak.
He doesn't have the looks or confidence to pull this off
So he calls syd to seal the deal.
We saw the pictures. Kate rejected barrett.
What pictures?
How does barrett pass a polygraph?
Even if he didn't kill her...
He'd have to make sure she's never found.
He's got a boat.
The locals checked it.
No sign kate was ever on it.
Wouldn't a boat have gps?
That's kate's phone.
There in the backseat.
Kate's mom has that right now.
You sure?
Yeah. They recovered that from her room.
So she made it back.
Kate's cell phone was left in the car
And then later turned up in her room.
How?
We figure most of the story's true.
That's why they never changed it.
They did drop kate off at the hotel.
Pearson took Barrett home just like they said.
But then because Barrett was rejected
He circled back to punish kate.
Well why would she let him in?
Because he had this.
No sign of a struggle in the room.
Barrett lured her outside
Maybe drugged her took her to his boat.
He was obsessed with the inlet.
He knew the traffic patterns there
when the fishermen were coming in
And tourist charters were going out.
The blood from the catch attracts hundreds of sharks.
It's a feeding frenzy out there that time of night.
We asked him if he killed her.
He didn't.
Asked where her body is. He doesn't know.
Technically those aren't lies.
How can you prove this?
We'll get them to admit it.
This was after you dropped kate at the motel. Agreed?
Yes.
Victory picture.
So kate's gone but her phone is right there.
And?
We found it in her room. You got any idea how it got there?
Why is the gps on your boat missing?
It isn't.
He tossed it after he dumped Kate.
Who are you?
This.
This was your ticket into her room.
Who is she?
You said the inlet's quiet between 4:00 and 5 a.M.
That's when you took kate out right?
You didn't want the search party to find her
So you kept going. And going.
You had 6 hours before work.
How far did you get?
About 75 miles out?
A full tank on a single outboard motor
Will get you 150 miles. At 25 miles per hour
Your round trip took just over 6 hours.
Which is why you were late for work.
Oh you didn't kill her.
You just left her to die.
That's why you asked for a polygraph.
You knew you'd pass it.
Why did you take kate to the inlet?
To look at the boats.
Come on man you know what happens down there
In the middle of the night.
Sharks happen Syd.
And they clean up your mess don't they?
That's why you dumped her body out there.
Did you dump her?
No.
No! What?
God...
No I didn't do that man.
I didn't--I didn't-- I mean I didn't do that.
I think your time's up.
Oh yeah? Well you took away their daughter
Their dignity.
You don't get to win.
We're going to find her.
You still think she has a chance huh?
Right. Thank you.
Coast guard's 70 miles out.
No sign of her.
Kate's an amazing swimmer.
If he didn't kill her when she hit the water
There's still a chance.
JJ that's 3 days in the ocean.
I know.
I know.
Help! Help! Someone help me!
Help!
Please help me!
Agent Hotchner.
They found her hugging a buoy.
She's alive.
Oh she did it.
She held on.
They found her. She's alive.
You know the first thing she said?
She's sorry.
They choked her.
They...
And she's sorry.
You saved my life.
I knew it wouldn't be fair to leave her alone but...
I didn't want to live.
It's my little girl.
And it's my job to keep her safe and...
I wasn't there.
You made her who she is.
She hung on in the middle of the ocean
For days.
That's strength I've never seen before.
I want Kate to meet you.
I'd like that.
Thank you.
I'd like to think that...
That your son was watching out for her.
When do I leave?
The end of the week.
What?
They wanted you to start tomorrow.
No I--I can't. I need to train someone.
I'm not replacing you.
No Hotch you can't take this on yourself.
Your hands are full.
We'll figure it out.
I'm hoping I can get you back.
Strauss wanted you to fill this out.
Exit interview.
Are you kidding me?
She's big on procedure.
Just be honest.
I was hoping I could do something about this.
And I'm sorry I couldn't.
I know.
How am I supposed to tell them I'm leaving
when I don't want to go?
The brass is really really good at taking power away.
It makes them feel like they're in charge.
That sounds like a profile.
You're going to be much better off than any of us you know that?
I'll miss you.
No.
Wait a minute. I thought Hotch was supposed to--
It's above his pay grade.
Strauss' too.
They can just take you away?
So we do nothing?
It's done.
It can't be that simple.
It is.
This job is hard enough.
What are they trying to do bury us?
You're too good.
That's the problem.
It's true. You're on everybody's wish list.
Our loss is somebody else's gain.
They can't just take you away.
You still here?
I figured you'd get to me eventually.
You're leaving?
You could have told me. I would have done something.
I would have made it impossible for them to let you go.
I would have put something in your file.
It's not up to me.
Or Hotch.
Don't they understand that we're a family?
That that's why this works is because we're a family.
Do they even care?
I don't know.
I can't believe...
Ok no that's--
I'm supposed to say that this is a great opportunity
Which it is.
I don't know the way this place works without you.
You're like the glue around here
who's gonna make us feel safe.
There's plenty of big strong men around.
See that right there?
Your total ignorance of how awesome you are
Is one of the 5.000 things I love about you.
I'm still gonna be in the city ok?
More than normal probably.
Sure.
And we'll make a plan.
Breakfast every tuesday.
And life gets in the way.
And what if I only see you on birthdays and holidays?
I won't let that happen.
Ok.
You better not because I know where to find you.
Yeah.
Ok.
We'll walk out together.
Uh...there's--there's one more thing
I need to do before I go.
Ok.
I'm thankful for my years spent with this family.
For everything we shared
Every chance we had to grow.
I'll take the best of them with me
and lead by their example wherever I go.
A friend told me to be honest with you.
So here it goes.
This isn't what I want
But I'll take the high road.
Maybe it's because I look at everything as a lesson.
or because I don't want to walk around angry.
or maybe it's because I finally understand.
There are things we don't want to happen
But have to accept.
Things we don't want to know
But have to learn.
And people we can't live without
