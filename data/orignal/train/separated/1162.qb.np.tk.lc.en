this is how i heard the story .
the twins played so nicely
while they waited for their parents to get home .
but they wouldn &apos;t get to
go trick @-@ or @-@ treat that night ...
... or ever again .
alison ! he &apos;s gonna go home and
tell his parents the story and i &apos;m gonna get fired .
come on , hanna , he loves it .
right ?
you &apos;ve been warned .
she lifted the knife high into the air ,
and then plunged it deep into her sister &apos;s chest !
a sick smile came across her face
as she watched the blood ooze out of her sister &apos;s heart .
and they had no choice but to send her away
to a home for the criminally insane .
and that &apos;s where she remained
until ... yesterday
when she escaped and vowed return to rosewood
and stab to death every child
who dares to go trick @-@ or @-@ treating on halloween !

so , what do you think of it ?
should hanna be a cute britney ?
or &quot; bald britney &quot; ?
if she wants to be , cute britney .
aria ?
she &apos;s not gonna shave her head .
spencer , you &apos;re worse than my father .
sorry .
but i did just procure nine votes from the debate team .
wait , that &apos;s a good thing , right ?
and &quot; procured &quot; means to obtain with special effort .
and &quot; obtain &quot; means to--
are you gonna recite the entire dictionary ?
i think that hanna should be who she wants to be .
fine . but you better wear the tightest skinny pants
you can fit your big butt into .
ben ?
he &apos;s all about me going as a sexy cop for halloween .
but i &apos;m thinking indian girl .
what a shame .
all that testosterone and not a sheep in sight .
careful , alison . i get your jokes ,
but someday you might meet a guy who doesn &apos;t .
so am i gonna see you at my party on friday ?
um , i didn &apos;t know we were invited .
your ali &apos;s friends , right ?
come prepared to be scared .
did we just get invited to
noel kahn &apos;s halloween bash ?
i &apos;m a little embarrassed by how excited you girls are .
it &apos;s just a party .
ali , it &apos;s not just a party .
it &apos;s the party .
you &apos;re right . and i &apos;m happy we &apos;ll be there together .
we should get ready together .
spence , you &apos;ve got let &apos;s have it there .
is that cool ?
yeah .
okay .
hold up .
i think there &apos;s somebody in there .
are you just trying to scare us ?
no , i swear , i just saw someone in the window .
well , kids go in there all the time around halloween .
it &apos;s like a rite passage in this town .
i wish they &apos;d just tear this place down already .
every time i walk by here i get the creeps .
it &apos;s just an ugly old house , aria .
i can &apos;t explain it . i just ...
i feel like something really bad happened here .
there &apos;s nobody in there .
come on .
are you moving ?
my dad got married again . they &apos;re moving in .
are you okay with that ?
it hasn &apos;t been that long since your mom--
it was a year ago last week .
you said &quot; they . &quot; does she have any kids ?
a daughter .
what &apos;s she like ?
she gets what she wants .
damnit !
noel !
admit it . you were scared .
you need to bring that to halloween .
i &apos;ll bring a lot more than that .
good .
lady g ?
i wasn &apos;t gonna dress up this year ,
but i got invited to some party , so ...
whose party ?
uh , noel somebody .
noel kahn . i &apos;ll be there .
and i &apos;m going as lady g .
she &apos;s so new , i thought i was being original .
you still have time to pick something else .
hmm . you &apos;re right .
maybe i &apos;ll see you there .
i know who you &apos;ll be .
and you &apos;ll surprise me .
oh . i &apos;m alison .
i know .
i &apos;m jenna .
freak !
do you think i &apos;m photogenic ?
my grandmother was a sweater model .
i look like her .
of course , she &apos;s old now and she smells terrible .
but i don &apos;t have to see her much
&apos;cause she lives in georgia .
my turn .
hmm . it &apos;s hd , so ...
the image is perfect , right ?
i like what i see .
it &apos;s perfect , spence ,
it &apos;s got humor , heart ,
it &apos;s inspiring--
i wish i could be there to hear it .
wow , spence , you got melissa &apos;s stamp of approval .
must be a good speech .
well , it better be .
my parents are already planning my victory party .
i guess that &apos;s what happens
when you &apos;ve got a perfect older sister .
no , alison ,
that &apos;s what happens when you &apos;re a hastings .
i didn &apos;t make the rules .
besides , spencer deserves to win .
her agenda is top @-@ notch .
thanks , melissa .
hmm . it &apos;s comforting to know that spencer can count on you .
so , melissa , did you tell spence
what we decided on for halloween ?
bonnie and clyde .
cool .
oh . sorry .
he &apos;s in a meeting .
oh . yeah , i was just leaving him a note .
ah . yes , i forgot my briefcase again .
yeah . mom saw it in the kitchen .
oh . hey , meredith . didn &apos;t realize you were here .
i needed a quite place to read .
hope that &apos;s okay .

i can &apos;t . i promised mom i &apos;d be home for dinner .
okay .
well , see you in class .

students crash here all the time .
&apos;cause you &apos;re so cool .
yeah , &apos; cause i &apos;m down with that .
come on , give me a break .
he &apos;s out there !
he &apos;s waiting for us !
he &apos;s coming to kill us ! we &apos;re gonna die !

hello ?
hello ?
hello ?
hello , is anybody there ?
were you at the costume shop today ?
alison ?
did you send me a text ?
no . why ?
ali , what &apos;s wrong ?
forget it .
i &apos;ve gotta go .
everything &apos;s fine .
your mom didn &apos;t do anything wrong ,
she did the right thing .
i had a few martinis at the grill .
then she wisely accepted my offer to drive her home .
so here &apos;s your keys .
thank you , officer .
i &apos;m glad i could help .
and it &apos;s darren , by the way .
okay . i &apos;ll take it from here .
good night .
good night .
i &apos;m sorry , hanna .
so what ?
you had too much to drink . who cares ?
no , not that .
about the mess we &apos;re in .
i should have seen it coming .
i &apos;m not gonna let you feel bad for what dad did to us .
he &apos;s the one who should be rotting in hell .
okay , stop . he &apos;s still your father .
how bad is the mess we &apos;re in ?
i will take care of it , honey .
you remember what i told you , right ?
she &apos;s pretty ugly .
how ugly is pretty ugly ?
hideous .
and don &apos;t even get me started on her big ass .
don &apos;t forget to buy your halloween festival tickets .
you have until fifth period to do so
in the multi @-@ purpose room .
em , you need to go talk to ben .
what &apos;s going on ?
he &apos;s been telling all of his guy friends
that you guys had sex last weekend .
what ?
em , i will go over there with you .
let &apos;s shut this thing down right now .
aria , don &apos;t .
emily , you can &apos;t just ignore this .
em ?
oh , my god .
is it true ?
why didn &apos;t you tell us ?
tell us what ?
hi , you guys .
if you ignore it , it will go away .
ben &apos;s telling people we had sex .
what ?
and he &apos;s still breathing because ?
it &apos;s true .
i can &apos;t believe emily lost her vee before any one of us did .
why is that so hard to believe ?
i didn &apos;t mean anything by it ,
i just thought you were a prude .
shy on the streets ... sexy in the sheets .
i knew there was something different about you .
alison !
do you hear mona ?
hey , aria ! hey , guys !
is she ever gonna get a clue ?
what a dork .
switch .
isn &apos;t that your dad &apos;s car ?
ever heard of knocking ?
you want to keep me out , put a lock on it .
what are you and your stoner buddies doing behind your locked door ?
you really want to know ?
give me twenty bucks . i &apos;m buyin &apos; the beer tonight .
twenty bucks for a secret ? you &apos;re so cheap .
we &apos;re making a movie .
what kind of movie ?
if i told you that i &apos;d have to kill you .
this was on the porch .
goodbye .
&quot; it &apos;s my turn to torture you . &quot;
did you find anything good ?
well , i could be a maid for the hacken family ,
or a nursemaid for a dirty old man .
this is interesting .
mom , it &apos;s that cop .
wait in the kitchen .
hey . ran into the mailman out here .
oh . thank you .
i patrol the neighborhood ,
so i thought i &apos;d stop by and see how you were doing .
i &apos;m fine .
good .
and your daughter , she &apos;s all right ?
we &apos;re both fine .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s not easy to adjust to living
without a man in the house .
we &apos;re adjusting .
well , listen ,
if you ever need anything , i &apos;m available .
i think you might have misunderstood the situation last night .
i just needed a ride home .
this is just me , trying to be nice .
thank you .
you should watch yourself on the roads out there .
what are you suggesting ?
people are unpredictable ... that &apos;s all .
have a nice day .
what was that ?
that was a horny cop .
but i think he gets it .
i &apos;m sure we won &apos;t see him again .
i thought you were hanging out with aria .
she wasn &apos;t feeling that great after we stopped for yogurt .
something happened .
what is it ?
i &apos;ve got a friend on the election committee .
i thought for sure you were a shoo @-@ in , but ...
did i lose ?
they &apos;re still counting ...
but it &apos;s gonna come down to a handful of votes .
ali , i wasn &apos;t kidding when i said
that my parents have already planned this party .
they booked a room ,
they &apos;ve invited like half the club .
i &apos;m sure melissa &apos;s made a few of those calls .
wake up , spencer . the big sister act is just that--an act .
and she &apos;s such a martyr
with the hastings family crap .
she works so hard to be perfect
because she doesn &apos;t want your parents
looking beyond the glow of her halo .
she doesn &apos;t want them to see you .
melissa &apos;s just trying to survive in this family ,
just like me .
are you sure about that ?
because it feels like she &apos;s winning , and you &apos;re not .
if i lose tomorrow , ali ...
look , if you really want this ...
i can make it happen .
i don &apos;t want it , ali ...
i need it .
i &apos;ve been calling you all afternoon .
where &apos;s mom ?
she took mike to the movies .
are you okay ?
what does she know ?
nothing .
how could you do this to her ?
listen ...
what you saw was the end of something , not the beginning .
she &apos;s transferring out of my class . i won &apos;t see her again .
and that &apos;s supposed to make it okay ?
no ... no .
but i &apos;m hoping that it &apos;s enough
for you to realize that
you don &apos;t need to tell your mom about this .
seriously ?
dad--
you &apos;re asking me to lie for you ?
i made a mistake .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be any bigger than it is right now .
would you still think it was a mistake
if i hadn &apos;t seen you with her today ?
yes .
all i &apos;m thinking about right now is your mom , and this family .
it &apos;s too late for that .
aria , you have every right to be mad at me .
i &apos;m just hoping that this can be less about that
and more about protecting your mom .
i don &apos;t think i can ever forgive you for this .
i &apos;m so sorry--
well , i will respect whatever your decision is .
i know a doctor if you want to go on the pill .
he &apos;ll see you without telling your mom .
i don &apos;t need to go on the pill .
you can &apos;t be too careful , emily .
i mean , juno was a cute movie ,
but i wouldn &apos;t want to live it .
it &apos;s not that .
i don &apos;t need to go on the pill because i &apos;m not having sex .
it was that bad ?
it didn &apos;t happen .
ben and i made out , but i didn &apos;t give it up .
then why is he telling people
he took the v.i.p. tour to neverland ?
i don &apos;t know .
what aren &apos;t you telling me ?
it &apos;s no big deal .
eventually we &apos;ll do it , so
people can think it now or they can think it later .
i can &apos;t figure you out .
can we just keep this between us ?
i don &apos;t want to keep having this conversation .
sure .
will you stop stressing ? i took care of it .
took care of what ?
i helped her with her acceptance speech .
easy on the coffee , spence .
your hand &apos;s already shaking .
are you kidding ? spencer bleeds caffeine .
you okay , sweetie ?
i &apos;m fine .
what &apos;s wrong , aria ?
how &apos;s your mom ?
ali .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry , ali .
don &apos;t touch me .
it was just an accident .
is that what the doctors told your mom and dad at the hospital ?
what ?
i &apos;ve heard the stories about you , hermie .
my name is lucas .
you &apos;ll always be hermie to me .
do you still have both ?
what are you talking about ?
come on , girls .
both what , ali ?
parts , hanna .
he &apos;s half @-@ guy , half @-@ girl .
one day she &apos;ll get what &apos;s coming to her .
student the wait is over .
to say it was a tight race is an understatement .
winning by two votes , please congratulate spencer hastings ,
your new class president !
hey . where &apos;s your costume ?
i &apos;m just not really feeling like going to a party ,
but i wanted to see you guys all dressed up .
what &apos;s this about , aria ?
oh , my gosh ! you guys !
there &apos;s somebody out there .
he &apos;s watching us .
oh , my god . who is that ?
i am so creeped out .
whoever it was , they &apos;re gone .
that was freaky .
it &apos;s halloween , hanna .
don &apos;t you love a good scare ?
it &apos;s probably the pizza guy .
hurry up before he leaves .
i don &apos;t want to go down alone .
i &apos;ll go .
yeah , me too . i &apos;m hungry .
can i talk to you , aria ?
yeah .
nobody likes a downer , aria ...
and since you saw your dad kissing that tart ,
you &apos;re like an energy suck every time you walk into a room .
ali , i &apos;m kind of dealing with a lot right now .
can you cut me some slack ?
are they getting a divorce ?
no .
if i were your mom ..
she doesn &apos;t know .
i knew your dad would talk to you out of it .
i &apos;m so overthinking about this .
i just want to go to a movie
and bury my face in vat of popcorn .
you committed to this party , aria .
there &apos;s gonna be a gazillion people there .
nobody &apos;s gonna miss me .
i will .
well , i appreciate that , but i just--
you know , it wasn &apos;t easy scoring you an invite .
a week ago noel kahn didn &apos;t even know your name .
yeah . yeah , i get it , okay ?
i just ... i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t tell the girls about what happened .
i &apos;m sure you appreciate that .
i do ... thanks .
are you sure we &apos;re the only ones who saw them ?
i &apos;d hate for your mom to find out from someone else .
would you actually do that ?
trick or treat , aria .
the band &apos;s gonna take a break , they &apos;ll be back in a few .
is the doctor in ?
actually , i &apos;m a gynecologist .
care to make an appointment ?
hot chick , britney ,
hot witch , hot indian chick ...
and , uh ...
mary queen of scots .
he doesn &apos;t know who that is . does anybody ?
she was born to be queen , but her cousin stole the throne ,
and then she was accused of treason
and her family had her executed .
it &apos;s my song , let &apos;s hit the dance floor !
oh , my god , another lady gaga ?
who is that ?
jenna .
meow .
do i know you ?
no , but you will .
you guys are so nice ,
i already feel like i belong here .
rosewood &apos;s a friendly town .
i decided to wear my original costume .
you look great .
maybe even better than me .
scram .
wow . you say &quot; froggy , &quot; they jump .
they &apos;re not as dumb as they look .
they know they need me .
congratulations .
i can make it really easy for you to fit in here .
if i accept you , everybody does .
i know how it works .
we &apos;re a tight group ,
but i think there &apos;s room for one more .
i really appreciate the offer ...
but i like to pick my own friends .
you &apos;re definitely the best gaga .
better not tell alison that .
she doesn &apos;t scare me .
i &apos;m jenna .
i &apos;m mona .
i saw you talking with that new girl .
what were you guys talking about ?
nothing . she &apos;s a slut .
here .
you should get rid of the evidence .
i thought you &apos;d look at them first .
you &apos;d be surprised to know who your friends aren &apos;t .
why do we have to go to the woods to get a drink ?
why can &apos;t he have a keg like a normal person ?
because he &apos;s not just a normal person .
he &apos;s noel kahn .
well ... i guess we made a wrong turn somewhere .
i &apos;m not that thirsty anymore .
okay , let &apos;s just go back .
were you wishing you could taste her cherry chapstick ?
what ?
don &apos;t worry , em . your secret &apos;s safe with me .
hey . have you seen ali ?
not lately .
okay ...
i used to think that i was born in the wrong century ,
but now that i &apos;ve actually gone to the bathroom in this thing ...
have you seen ali ?
last i saw her she was at the bonfire .
you don &apos;t think she &apos;d bail on us , do you ?
that &apos;s weird .
oh , it &apos;s from ali .
&quot; i &apos;m in trouble . come alone . &quot;
what &apos;s the address ?
it &apos;s 313 mockingbird .
i am not going in there .
no . this is some kind of joke .
she &apos;s not in there .
what if it &apos;s not a joke ?
ali ?
this isn &apos;t funny anymore , ali .
alison !
it was just the wind .
come on .
you guys .
it &apos;s locked .
ali ?
did you see him ? is he still here ?
who ?
come in .
i don &apos;t know who it is .
ali , what is going on ?
he grabbed me at the party .
i tried to scream , but he &apos;s got a knife .
for real ?
he said he brought me here to kill me .
i &apos;m calling 911 .
he locked me in a closet ,
and when he opened it , i just freaked on him .
i &apos;ve been hiding up here ever since .
i &apos;m not getting a signal .
there &apos;s nobody out there .
ali , it &apos;s probably just somebody trying to scare you .
look i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s that guy that was watching us at spencer &apos;s .
he &apos;s wearing the same costume .
we have to get out of here now .
no , i &apos;m not going anywhere until we know that freak &apos;s gone !
look , i called you from the hallway ,
i know i &apos;ve got a signal there .
lock the door behind me .
ali .
are you sure ?
no , ali , don &apos;t .
don &apos;t open this door for anyone but me .
lock the door .

come on , you guys ... it was funny .
we &apos;re not laughing .
well , you should be .
you guys passed the test .
what test ?
the way you guys came charging in here ...
i know i can count on you now .
if i really need you , you &apos;ll be there for me .
let &apos;s go . we &apos;re missing a party .
i feel like we came back to a different party .
i know , everyone &apos;s so much older .
what &apos;s your sister doing here ?
oh , these must be eric &apos;s friends .
he &apos;s noel &apos;s older brother .
what that saying ?
&quot; boys play with toys and girls play with boys . &quot;
i haven &apos;t heard that one .
who &apos;s that guy dressed up as a cop ?
that &apos;s not a costume . he &apos;s a real cop .
do you know him ?
no . um , i &apos;ve just ...
seen him directing traffic .
bitch .
who is that ?
don &apos;t hate me , okay ?
are you kidding ? ok . it was perfect .
you &apos;re not mad ?
no !
the way you shoved me against that wall ?
you even scared me .
uh , i &apos;m not sure what you &apos;re talking about .
noel .
we know that it was you . alison told us .
if somebody messed with you guys , it wasn &apos;t me .
my brother took the car for a beer run .
i &apos;ve been stuck here all night .
if you &apos;re lying to me ...
i &apos;m not .
if it wasn &apos;t you ...
who is it ?
