gossip gril here ,
you &apos;re one of the resources
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
nate archibald .
can i at least get your number ?
hey , serena .
nate .
this is juliet .
here you go , grandpa .
this is milo humphrey , your grandson .
we need to get our own paternity test done .
milo &apos;s bracelet says his blood type is o @-@ negative .
likely , so is milo &apos;s real father .
i &apos;ve been acting like i &apos;m okay , but i &apos;m not .
what if i stay like this forever ?
what if i never get over chuck ?
when you dragged me in from the alley ,
you didn &apos;t just save my life .
you gave me the hope of a new one .
to new york ? you got me a ticket ?
we don &apos;t need tickets . i &apos;m chuck bass .
arsinglews timtam estelle00 elysecff
i don &apos;t understand .
how can &quot; gossip girl &quot; be down
my first day at columbia ?
maybe gossip girl get kidnapped ? unstable ex @-@ boyfriend
lock internet tattletale in basement--
dorota ! what did i tell you ?
no more watching
&quot; law &amp; order : svu &quot; while
you &apos;re breast @-@ feeding .
no , unlike those plebeians at n.y.u. , the students at columbia
actually respect and understand the power of gossip girl .
but how is my first day supposed to matter
if gossip girl isn &apos;t around to tell people it does ?
still nothing .
good .
i forgot how exciting the first day of school can be--
a new fall wardrobe , fresh slate .
the fact that gossip girl isn &apos;t around to stir up trouble
only makes it that much more perfect .
or she could be planning something big
for your first day . after all , the site says
&quot; under construction , &quot; not , uh , &quot; out of service . &quot;
what are you doing up here ? i was worried .
just looking at your world . it &apos;s magnificent .
so if you really are the big boss like you say ,
can you make it so that no one comes up here and disturbs us ?
i already made the call .
well , the good thing about no gossip girl--
no chuck .
what about you ?
you &apos;re the one who has to start college
with an ex @-@ boyfriend loose on campus .
there won &apos;t be any issues . nate and i are still friends ,
ven if he is dating some gorgeous blonde named juliet .
oh , please . you are serena van der woodsen .
we &apos;ve been on campus-- what , five minutes ?
i bet there &apos;s already
an entire frat house filled with guys fighting over you .
and don &apos;t worry . my jealousy issues are as over
as surf fabrics for evening wear .
besides , we &apos;re carrying on
our divide and conquer strategy from paris .
but where will our neutral meeting ground be ?
hot &amp; crusty will not possibly do after cafe louis @-@ philippe .
but hamilton house will .
so they do have a columbia chapter .
you know , i always suspected nate was a member ,
but he would never fess up .
he was right not to . their membership is so restricted
they make soho house
look like a halfway house .
so then how do we apply ?
we don &apos;t .
incoming students are selected
by an anonymous board of alumni .
if you dare to think you were chosen ,
you have to find the keymaster on the first day of class .
either a key or
white @-@ hot shame awaits you .
then let &apos;s go receive our new accessories .
hello ?
i &apos;m dreading this .
as much as the truth might be a relief ,
it &apos;s also the toughest thing he &apos;ll ever have to face .
well , just be prepared . who knows how he &apos;ll react ?
he may not even believe you .
and genetics don &apos;t lie ,
even though some doctors who administer paternity tests do .
i &apos;m here . wish me luck .
good luck , my darling .
hey , dad .
is everything okay ?
is georgina home ?
no . she should be back
from her spa trip any moment .
why ? why ? what &apos;s going on ?
hey , man .
i meant to give this back to you last night .
this summer was ... very rewarding , but i &apos;m done .
you and serena back on ?
no . no , but i &apos;m good .
i , uh , i met this girl i like .
now if i could only get her to go out with me .
have faith .
if a good woman can change me ,
surely one can date you .
good morning , nate . it &apos;s nice to see you .
nice to see you , eva .
everything &apos;s so different .
i keep wanting to call him henry .
it &apos;s a long story , but it has a happy ending .
should i make us some breakfast ?
you don &apos;t have to make anything for anyone .
you can have whatever you want at the touch of a button .
now simone is waiting for you in the spa on the second floor .
just tell her what you &apos;d like to eat .
she &apos;ll have it delivered before your massage ... or after .
it &apos;s entirely up to you .
this is crazy .
your life is ... perfect .
now so is yours .
so , henry , why do i get the impression
that you might not have told her your whole life story ?
and i thought college
was gonna be different than high school .
who would want that ?
sorry , but this is a private club .
no has @-@ beens allowed .
penelope . good to see you , too . long time .
clearly , standards have slipped if you &apos;re a member here .
to whom should i speak to have you removed
once we get our keys ?
the wall . my great @-@ aunt-- she was a founding member .
nepotism .
that explains it . now if you don &apos;t mind ,
would you direct us to the keymaster
and then get me some cashews ? i &apos;m famished .
those two ? we &apos;re so in .
oh , no , it &apos;s her .
you know the keymaster ? that &apos;s perfect .
well , maybe .
we &apos;re here to get our keys .
blair waldorf , serena van der woodsen .
hi . we &apos;ve met .
i &apos;m ... sorry . we have ?
at dan humphrey &apos;s , with nate .
oh . right . serena .
this is why i hate it when best friends show up together .
unfortunately , i &apos;m down to my very last key ,
which means ... only one of you made the list .
only one ?
it &apos;s okay .
we &apos;ll find a different meeting place ,
like the library or bookstore or starbucks .
this key is for blair waldorf .
sorry for the silent treatment , gossips .
but everyone needs the occasional r &amp; r ,
even yours truly .
lucky for you ,
i observed a sacred upper east side tradition
and had a little work done while i was gone .
now enough with the pleasantries .
time for the dirt .
i spy with my many eyes--
chuck bass returning from paris yesterday
with a pretty , new fall accessory .
but if she &apos;s the kind of girl you bring home
to meet your stepmother , why is chuck visiting lily solo ?
i &apos;m so sorry . i know how much milo means to you .
i just can &apos;t ... believe this .
why ? why would georgina do this ? how--
you want me to stick around till she gets home ?
we can talk to her together , figure this out .
no , no , i @-@ i think--i think i need to handle this on my own .
thanks , dad .
also spotted-- lonely boy &apos;s baby mama
looking like one hot mama on the beach in st. barts .
if she &apos;s flown the coop ,
who &apos;s cleaning up her baby &apos;s poop ?
and what about serena and blair ?
it seems our girls have started their college careers
with a social call to hamilton house .
i &apos;m sorry , serena , but this club is for members only .
great . i &apos;ll see myself out then .
but if b. is the one holding the key to the kingdom ,
guess serena is out in the cold .
i &apos;m sorry for what happened with jenny .
she was in a bad place . i could &apos;ve helped her .
instead , i just used her pain
for my own self @-@ destruction .
thank you for the apology .
and welcome home .
please don &apos;t disappear again .
i don &apos;t intend to .
i just hope everyone &apos;s as relieved to see me as you are .
well , let &apos;s not ask for too much off the bat , shall we ?
so tell me what happened .
i heard about the mugging from serena , but then ...
i , met someone .
someone wonderful .
she found me , nursed me back to health .
her name &apos;s eva .
so when do i get to meet her ?
when do you feel it would be appropriate
to introduce her to everyone ?
i &apos;m not going to lie .
you haven &apos;t exactly come home to a fan club .
but let me talk to rufus and eric , and ,
see if i can make some progress .
i &apos;d appreciate that .
why don &apos;t you bring eva to fashion &apos;s night out tomorrow ?
everyone can meet and mingle
without the pressure of a dinner .
that sounds great . thank you .
thank you for everything .
serena , i don &apos;t have to accept .
any club that &apos;ll only take one of us
is a club i don &apos;t want to be a part of .
blair , stop it .
i would never stand in the way of your social progress .
besides , hamilton house isn &apos;t for me anyway .
it &apos;s much more right bank .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re my best friend .
hey .
okay .
first day download dinner tonight ? sorella ?
of course . i &apos;ll see you later .
that &apos;s right . it &apos;s &quot; sparks . &quot;
s @-@ p @-@ a @-@ r--
i &apos;m sorry . can you hold on one moment ?
hello ?
dan , hey . uh , we didn &apos;t get much of a chance to talk last night ,
but i was ...
is that milo i hear ?
serena , this is a terrible time . i &apos;m sorry . can i--
i &apos;m--i &apos;m gonna have to call you later . all right ?
later , man .
nate ! how happy am i to see a friendly face .
walk me to class ? i &apos;m really lost .
can you help me , please ?
you know what ? i &apos;m--i &apos;m running late , so ... i &apos;m sorry .
okay . you know , it &apos;d be really great to catch for real , though .
blair and i are going to dinner tonight . do you wanna join ?
we could start our own club .
un , you know what ? i &apos;m already a part of this one .
i &apos;m gonna go head in .
i &apos;ll call you back .
chuck is in new york ?
he came to see me this morning .
thought i would just tell you when i saw you .
well , eric told me first .
apparently , it was on &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
you have every right to be upset with him ,
but we can &apos;t undo what &apos;s already been done .
he &apos;s trying to make amends , take responsibility .
what else is there ?
he met this woman who &apos;s had a big impact on him .
you can see for yourself how much .
i invited them to the party tomorrow night .
and i would appreciate
if you would just give them both a chance .
well , jenny keeps telling me it wasn &apos;t his fault .
maybe it &apos;s time i believed her .
thank you .
okay . i &apos;ll see you soon .
what do you think of this one ?
if i answered out loud ,
i &apos;d probably be asked to leave the store .
i &apos;m afraid i have to go see my lawyer .
apparently , disappearing for three months
isn &apos;t good for business .
but i don &apos;t know which one is appropriate for the event .
buy them all . my card &apos;s with leandra .
when you &apos;re finished , the car &apos;s waiting outside .
bye .
bye .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s more excited that you &apos;re in the house--
the girls that wanna borrow your clothes
or the boys that wanna take them off .
oh , well , thanks for the warning on both counts .
but i have to ask--
why didn &apos;t serena get a key ?
it just seems like kind of an oversight to me .
i agree , but maybe it &apos;s not the worst thing in the world .
isn &apos;t it nice to have something that &apos;s just yours for a change ?
oh . well , i ...
i have to get back to campus .
i know that you said that you had plans with serena tonight ,
but maybe you can stop by the house for a drink beforehand ?
inaugural martinis are a hundred @-@ year @-@ old tradition ,
and so are the eager @-@ to @-@ please college boys .
i do hate to disrespect tradition .
bye .
leandra , help . i &apos;m stuck .
oh , hello . blair , right ?
i &apos;m eva .
yeah , i know who you are .
i &apos;m just surprised to see you here .
oh , chuck asked me to come back with him .
no , i don &apos;t mean in the city .
i mean in carlos miele .
i know . i can &apos;t believe it either .
chuck is so wonderful .
he &apos;s buying me a dress for a party that his stepmother is--
look , if you wanna hole up in chuck &apos;s hotel suite
and feed him croissants , that &apos;s his business .
but introducing you to his family ? my friends ?
blair , i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t wanna hurt you in any way .
oh , you &apos;re the one that &apos;s gonna end up being hurt , ma biche ,
and not by me .
chuck will soon realize that it doesn &apos;t matter if the dress is couture
if the girl is off @-@ the @-@ rack .
and then , as with all things that don &apos;t fit ,
you &apos;ll be sent back to where you came from .
oh , and by the way ,
if i were you , i &apos;d wanna accessorize with some gloves .
not even a manicure can mask those peasant hands .
and the only thing we know about georgina &apos;s whereabouts
is that she &apos;s in st . barts ?
i called every resort i could find .
there is no georgina sparks staying at any of them .
she could &apos;ve moved to a different island by now .
she--she could be staying under a different name .
i don &apos;t know . but she took-- she took everything , vanessa .
she took her passport . she &apos;s gone .
she left milo , and i don &apos;t--
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s coming back .
so we know you dated royalty .
tell us what it &apos;s like .
well , dating a prince isn &apos;t really different
than dating anyone else ,
except instead of flowers , you get diamonds .
another martini , b. ?
actually , i think penelope wants to get me a drink ,
to make up for the less @-@ than @-@ lovely welcome .
hey , how far are you ?
i &apos;m starving .
i am so sorry , s. i totally lost track of time .
can you hang on a second ?
can i invite serena ?
it &apos;s club members only tonight . i &apos;m sorry .
but don &apos;t tell her that you &apos;re here , though .
you saw her face when she didn &apos;t get a key .
i just ... i don &apos;t want her to feel bad .
where are you ?
i &apos;m just walking into my building .
the doormen are hopeless gossips .
you &apos;re not leaving , are you ?
you still owe us tips on dating royalty .
can i take a rain check , s. ?
i &apos;m feeling more like
a bubble bath and bubbly tonight .
i guess i &apos;ll just see you tomorrow .
yeah .
bye .
thank you , hamilton house .
spotted--
b. holding court at hamilton house .
don &apos;t worry , s.
it &apos;s not your party , but you can cry if you want to .
i was hoping i &apos;d find you here .
and i was hoping you &apos;d find me .
so i was wondering ,
does volunteering at fashion &apos;s night out
mean you can &apos;t bring a date ?
not necessarily ,
but i prefer not to mix business with pleasure .
how long are you gonna make me wait ?
serena &apos;s out of the picture .
are you sure serena agrees with that ?
that &apos;s why she doesn &apos;t get a vote .
how about i volunteer ? and then that way ,
it can be work for both of us .
you don &apos;t give up , do you ?
i haven &apos;t had to try this hard before .
it &apos;s ... refreshing .
were we supposed to meet up ?
last night we were ,
but according to &quot; gossip girl , &quot;
you had a better offer .
i &apos;m sorry .
b. , it &apos;s okay . i know you &apos;re gonna have house events .
you just don &apos;t need to cover it up .
i know . i was just drunk on gin and attention .
and juliet told me that i shouldn &apos;t tell you
because it would hurt your feelings .
and i know i shouldn &apos;t have listened to her .
juliet--the one who &apos;s dating my ex
and swears she doesn &apos;t remember my name ?
she &apos;s concerned with my feelings now ?
if anything , she &apos;s the one behind all of this .
all of this ?
my gosh .
you can &apos;t believe you didn &apos;t get in .
you &apos;ve never lost before .
this isn &apos;t a conspiracy , serena .
face it . hamilton house just didn &apos;t want you .
i got it .
oh , my god !
did you just get a key ?
yep . and my mom said i &apos;d never get in
unless i lost 10 pounds .
she &apos;s a bitch .
eva , are you ready ? we should go .
what &apos;s wrong ?
you should go without me .
i thought you wanted to meet everyone .
yesterday , after you left me at the shop , i ran into blair .
let me guess .
she took one look at you , radiant in a beautiful gown ,
and started shredding the dress and your self @-@ esteem .
some of what she said made sense .
that &apos;s blair . she wouldn &apos;t waste her breath hurling insults
if she didn &apos;t think they &apos;d land .
she reads people , senses vulnerability .
you just need to be stronger than that .
easy for you to say .
you &apos;re used to all of this--
the cars and clothes , the spa , the roof .
i &apos;m not like you or blair .
when we walk into that party ,
you &apos;ll see me through everyone else &apos;s eyes ,
and it won &apos;t be so charming .
it &apos;s not true .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re not too comfortable here .
honestly , it speaks to your character .
it &apos;s the reason lily will love you ,
why everyone will once they get to know you .
okay .
i &apos;ll get dressed .
can you ...
can you tell me all their names again ?
lily ...
lily ...
rufus ...
rufus , eric ... serena .
you know , elliot is the bow tie master
in our relationship ,
so i guess i can &apos;t wear one now
until he &apos;s home visiting from yale .
well , if your mother taught me , i can teach you .
or we can call in the true expert .
your mother invited chuck and his new girlfriend tonight .
she feels strongly that he &apos;s changed .
after talking it over ,
i think that we should see for ourselves .
everybody deserves a second chance .
a second chance , sure ,
but chuck &apos;s had a bunch .
after a certain point , a person &apos;s beyond redemption .
look , this is hard for me , too .
and as upset as the jenny situation might make me ,
you just can &apos;t go writing people off .
you don &apos;t understand .
it &apos;s not like what happened between chuck and jenny
was an isolated incident .
what do you mean not isolated ?
i shouldn &apos;t have said anything .
this is important , eric .
what are you--what are you not telling me ?
when jenny was a freshman ,
chuck tried to force himself on her at a party .
so i don &apos;t care what chuck says about being a changed man .
what he did to jenny this time makes it clear .
he has always been that person , and he always will be .
i &apos;m sorry , rufus .
all right , we &apos;re leaving . we &apos;re not coming back here .
well , what did they say ?
that milo would go into foster care
before he gets adopted , which could take years .
and until then , he would just be moved from home to home ,
you know , with no real family ,
and i couldn &apos;t even see him if i wanted to .
that &apos;s awful .
you think that &apos;s awful ? there &apos;s an entire wall of photos
covered with kids waiting to be adopted .
i @-@ i don &apos;t care if milo &apos;s not my biological son .
he &apos;s not going into foster care .
if georgina does not turn up , i &apos;m keeping him .
juliet , hey .
oh , hi , serena .
i actually can &apos;t talk right now .
i &apos;m running late to go help out downtown .
oh , come on .
don &apos;t you think you &apos;re going a little far to hold on to nate ?
what are you talking about ?
serena , if this is about the keys ,
as i said , there was only one left ,
and it was marked for blair .
really ? because i ran into a girl
who got a key from you this afternoon .
yes . okay , it &apos;s true . there were more keys ,
but i thought that it would be even more awkward
if i revealed that .
i don &apos;t determine who the keys go to .
the alumni committee makes that decision .
at least , they usually do .
what do you mean ?
it wasn &apos;t them who didn &apos;t want you in . it was someone else .
okay , then who ?
blair ?
no , she wouldn &apos;t do that .
you were on the list until two nights ago .
and when i called to find out what had happened ,
they said that blair waldorf had called
to give them more information about you ,
including ...
something about a sex tape ...
with a guy named pete ...
fairman ?
did you really think
that she was ever gonna let you steal her spotlight at columbia ?
serena , i am so sorry .
i shouldn &apos;t have said anything . i just ...
i would &apos;ve hated for you not to know the truth .
they say old habits die hard .
sorry .
but when it comes to serena and blair ,
old jealousies die harder .
and even if i drop out of school ,
it means i &apos;d have to get a job . i &apos;d have to get a nanny .
you know , what if i get one
who spikes milo &apos;s bottle with benadryl at nap time ?
i could ... maybe help .
you &apos;ve been great , but this is more than , like ,
a @-@ a good swaddle and formula runs .
i mean , i could move in ,
and we could work it out
the same way you were gonna do it with georgina .
and i have mostly morning classes , anyway .
vanessa , hold on a second .
this is ... way beyond girlfriend duty .
you know , you didn &apos;t sign up for any of this .
neither did you .
and today &apos;s the last day i can withdraw from campus housing
and get my money back .
are you sure ?
if ted danson and tom selleck can do it ,
so can we .
right ?
as long as it doesn &apos;t make me guttenberg .
hey , have you guys seen blair ?
blair told me she was meeting juliet at diane von furstenberg .
finally .
nothing makes it a party
like a serena / blair showdown .
prepare your cell phones , ladies .
i &apos;d never think i would be so nervous .
hey , i told you , underneath all the pretty ,
they &apos;re all just starving wannabes . let &apos;s go find lily .
my husband rufus and my son eric .
how do you ? hello . heard so much about you .
on second thoughts , why don &apos;t , um , we get a drink ?
it might take the edge off . would you mind ?
okay , yeah .
thank you .
so are you gonna entertain us with another song this year ?
why don &apos;t we top off our glasses ?
and we can discuss that in major detail .
wonderful .
rufus , eric . it &apos;s good to see you .
okay , i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m sorry--
you got a lot of nerve showing your face here .
i thought lily spoke with you .
she did , but that was before i found out
you tried to rape my 14 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
i know nothing i can do will make up for that night ,
but it was years ago . i apologized to jenny .
she forgave me . did something happen to change your mind ?
no , i just thought it was time rufus knew the whole story
between you and jenny .
i &apos;m glad i did , because now i can keep you
the hell away from my family .
i understand your anger , and i &apos;m truly sorry .
but i want you to know that i would never do anything
to hurt your daughter or anyone else ever again .
if you &apos;ll excuse me ...
as a father , it &apos;s my responsibility to make sure
no one else &apos;s daughter gets hurt like mine did .
so where &apos;s this new girlfriend lily told me about ?
she should know what kind of a man you are .
is that her ?
no . it &apos;s obviously just another social climber
making a play for chuck bass .
whoever she is , she &apos;s not with me .
what &apos;s going on ? flash sale on wrap dresses ?
better . serena thinks blair blocked her
from getting into hamilton house and is going
&quot; jersey shore &quot; on her ass .
and &quot; gossip girl &apos;s &quot; streaming it live .
you couldn &apos;t stand my stealing your spotlight !
why wouldn &apos;t hamilton house want you ?
let &apos;s go see . i love car wrecks .
give it a minute .
yeah , while you were at n.y.u. ,
begging for middle class minions , i had a job !
you can &apos;t seriously be referring to your ...
we can watch from here .
i learned a lot about the issues .
you mean your daddy issues .
oh , like you &apos;re so healthy !
&quot; i love chuck . i hate chuck . i love chuck . i hate chuck . &quot;
oh , and who do you love ? ! nate , then dan , then dan again .
aaron , gabriel , carter , tripp ,
then dan again , then nate again .
did your father finally fix that ?
&apos;cause he seemed pretty busy giving your mom fake cancer .
i think we &apos;ve seen enough .
we have to save our sister from that crazy bitch .
turns out i &apos;m not the crazy one .
or the bitch .
champagne ?
spotted--
s. and b. discovering the joys of filmmaking .
smile for your close @-@ up , juliet .
no , you don &apos;t really have the humphrey jaw , but ...
my name is on your birth certificate ,
so i &apos;m gonna be your dad .
vanessa &apos;s gonna be here , so that means
you &apos;re probably gonna be the only kid at preschool
who &apos;s seen &quot; the battleship potemkin &quot;
more times than &quot; finding nemo . &quot;
let &apos;s hope she brought some pizza &apos; cause daddy &apos;s starving .
you hungry ?
oh ! my sweet baby . i missed you so much .
what the hell-- what the hell you doing ?
um , i &apos;m back from the spa , and much refreshed .
thank you for noticing .
georgina , i know you weren &apos;t at the spa ,
and i know milo is not my son .
dan , i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i can explain .
i don &apos;t wanna hear this .
you don &apos;t understand . someone was trying to kill me .
admittedly , your ploy to blame me
for serena not getting into hamilton house
would &apos;ve worked in high school , but not now .
did you really think i would believe you over blair ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about ...
or what just ... happened here .
we had dorota film us earlier .
&quot; gossip girl &quot; played it as a favor .
she prefers to be the only one screwing with us .
hey , juliet . what &apos;s--what &apos;s going on ?
serena &apos;s upset she didn &apos;t get into hamilton house .
you purposely kept me out .
why would i do that ?
because you &apos;re jealous of her relationship with nate
and her friendship with me , obviously .
whatever twisted frenemy / ex @-@ boyfriend situation
you have going on , serena , it has nothing to do with me .
i told you that the alumni committee
makes the decision--
you seriously thought
we wouldn &apos;t know anyone on the committee ?
you can &apos;t . that &apos;s the &quot; secret &quot; part of a secret committee .
unless the keymaster misbehaves .
half of the board members of bass industries are alumni .
one phone call confirmed the obvious--
that serena has always been at the top of the list .
congratulations , darling .
key , please .
juliet .
ladies , champagne ?
juliet !
nate , are you really going after her ?
i didn &apos;t find your little show as charming
as everyone else did .
well , it wasn &apos;t meant to be . what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s like ever since i got back , you &apos;re angry with me .
i @-@ i thought we ended things as friends .
serena , you cheated on me with dan ,
and then you dumped me ,
and then you disappeared for the whole summer .
and you come back acting as if nothing &apos;s changed .
but i did .
and i guess it took me until now to realize
just how mad i am at you .
when i got on the plane to minsk ,
the guy from the bar wasn &apos;t in the seat next to me .
it was a russian businessman named sergi .
by the time we landed ,
we were platinum members of the mile high club .
oh , why am i not surprised ?
we did it on the ground , too .
um , anyway , everything would &apos;ve been fine
if he didn &apos;t tell his loony wife oksana
that i was pregnant with his child .
she threatened to kill me .
so then you escaped to brooklyn .
but this is all just a cover ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re really a russian spy ,
like those women in westchester .
no . uh , i mean , not that i wasn &apos;t approached ,
&apos;cause i was .
i came back because three guys named boris
were paid a lot of money to hunt me down .
and then i realized if i can make oksana believe
that it wasn &apos;t sergi &apos;s baby , she would leave me alone .
i thought you were the only guy decent enough ,
at least who i slept with , to take on that responsibility .
i sent a fork to the paternity test .
it was sergi &apos;s .
i just labeled it &quot; dan humphrey . &quot;
is this all supposed to somehow be flattering ?
yes . when you signed the birth certificate ,
oksana called off her cossacks .
you saved my life and milo &apos;s .
and to show your thanks ,
you lied to me and you abandoned your son .
look , i was free and clear on a beach in st. barts
like a younger , hotter version of
kathleen turner in &quot; body heat . &quot;
but i missed milo .
i needed to come home .
i called my parents ,
and we spent the last 24 hours
in an intensive family therapy session .
they &apos;re gonna let me move back in .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m truly glad that
you &apos;ve gotten your priorities straightened out here ,
but there--there &apos;s no way
that i &apos;m letting you take this child .
i &apos;m sorry , dan , but it &apos;s not your choice .
he &apos;s not your son .
georgina . what &apos;s going on ?
milo &apos;s going home .
rufus told me what happened .
you probably shouldn &apos;t be seen speaking to me .
i explained to him that
jenny confided in me a while ago about the party .
and reassured him that she &apos;s put the past in the past
and wants to move on .
i love you , charles .
and if eva is everything you say she is ,
i think she will , too .
is this chuck &apos;s limo ?
can you take me to the hotel , please ?
hey .
i couldn &apos;t find your car . they all look the same .
please let me explain .
there &apos;s nothing to say . i told you this would happen .
eva , it wasn &apos;t you i was ashamed of .
it was me .
what can you have to be ashamed of ?
everything i did until the day i met you .
look , i should &apos;ve told you about my past ,
but i couldn &apos;t risk losing you .
well , i &apos;m going now .
so tell me , who the hell are you , chuck bass ?
sometimes , you just have to come clean ,
no matter how many dirty secrets come out .
charlotte .
oh , i was hoping you &apos;d be here .
hey , blair .
will i see you at my show tomorrow ?
i wouldn &apos;t miss it .
welcome home .
i &apos;d like to say i &apos;m glad ,
but the jury &apos;s still out .
apparently , you met eva .
yeah , well , i told you to come home .
i never said it was gonna be easy .
is she still with you ?
not anymore .
wow . she lasted two days . i &apos;m impressed .
it was good to see you , blair .
you didn &apos;t leave .
i &apos;m not gonna lie .
it was hard to hear the things you &apos;ve done .
but i &apos;ve seen the man you can be ,
and i choose to believe in that man .
come on . let &apos;s meet my family .
hey . i thought you left .
i had to oversee gift bags .
some advice-- don &apos;t get into a fight
at a party you helped organize .
so , awkward question--
is it true you shut serena out because of me ?
when serena walked into hamilton house , it just ...
sort of hit me .
your ex @-@ girlfriend was gonna be around all the time .
well , that &apos;s an interesting reaction
for someone who &apos;s not sure they wanna go out with me .
maybe i &apos;m more sure than i thought .
once men have tasted caviar ,
it baffles me how they settle for catfish .
how you doing ?
uh , i &apos;m okay .
i &apos;m okay , i guess .
i just talked to my dad ,
and he--he thinks i should keep busy .
you know , throw myself into more traditional college pastimes ,
like noam chomsky and beer pong .
sounds like good advice .
easier said than done , unfortunately .
look , i don &apos;t want to bug you ,
but the van &apos;s double @-@ parked downstairs with my boxes .
so should i just have them take everything back to the dorm ?
what do you mean ?
we don &apos;t have to do this , dan .
i mean , we made this decision
when we thought milo was gonna be here .
i want you to stay .
hey , i &apos;m just curious .
did you pack that hideous bath mat
that your mom made for you ?
it &apos;s a prayer rug .
oh . okay .
well , is it wrong of me to pray that it got lost in the move ?
i &apos;m kidding . i &apos;m kidding . it &apos;ll look great here .
come help me .
so how was it , seeing chuck with eva ?
harder than i expected .
but at least he &apos;s not going to columbia .
no offense .
yeah , i @-@ i guess
i just didn &apos;t expect nate to be so mad at me .
i thought the only thing he got upset about
was a badly rolled joint .
but we both deserve better ,
and now that we &apos;re at hamilton house where we belong ,
we &apos;ll find it .
i don &apos;t know . even though i was right about juliet ,
you were right about me .
i did assume college would be easy .
it &apos;ll get better .
after all , you are serena van der woodsen .
and ... you do have
the best off @-@ campus housing of anyone at columbia .
what are you talking about ?
follow me .
what ? !
it &apos;s your new bedroom !
oh , my gosh ! blair !
i put dorota straight to work
the minute i got back from paris .
you should &apos;ve seen her yelling at the decorator
while anastasia was fast asleep in the ergo .
he say you cannot get wallpaper done in time .
i simply make clear he can .
so what do you think ?
can best friends live together all year ?
of course !
rumor has it
that s. and b. changed their relationship status
trom besties to roomies .
friends or lovers ,
moving in is risky business .
any time the rules change ,
you don &apos;t know how they &apos;ll change you .
we take the risk
because the payoff can be so great .
but the truth is ,
we never truly know who we &apos;re living with ...
or the company they keep .
how are you ?
depends .
how are things going ?
the guys were easy , but the girls are presenting
a little bit more of a challenge .
apparently , sisterhood is alive and well on the upper east side .
how long can that last ?
exactly .
so you just keep your focus on not getting raped or killed .
it &apos;s a minimum security prison .
and you are hot .
even white collar criminals get lonely .
don &apos;t worry .
we &apos;ll get it done .
i promise .
better watch out , kids . trouble &apos;s moving in ,
and it &apos;s looking to make the upper east side its bitch .
