my name is elena gilbert .
i &apos;m a new vampire , and there have been complications .
i know that i &apos;m sired to you , damon .
you know what would make me happy ?
that what you actually felt for me was real .
but there &apos;s hope now .
jeremy &apos;s tattoo leads to a cure .
if you kill klaus &apos;s brother kol ,
his entire sire line will die with them .
i was gonna make him suffer on my terms !
unlikely alliances have formed .
finding the cure could come at a price .
he &apos;s the world &apos;s first immortal being ,
who just happens to be the person with the cure .
i want to free him .
but we finanlly have everything we need .
here we go .
congratulations .
we made it .
they couldn &apos;t have hidden this cure in hawaii ?
where the hell did you take us ?
200 miles off the nova scotia mainland .
if you recall , the whole point was to hide the cure
on the world &apos;s most obscure , desolate island .
oh , yeah ? i thought the whole point
was that no one found silas ,
the oldest , deadliest freak in the world .
yeah , that too .
sunscreen ?
is that a joke ?
you &apos;re right .
you know your not really helping .
you &apos;re perfectly capable of tying a knot .
your giving elena the evil eye-- it &apos;s not really helping .
she killed my brother ,
tried to get you to put a dagger in my back .
she &apos;s lucky all she &apos;s getting is the evil eye .
you know i can hear you , right ?
you know i don &apos;t care , right ?
go ahead . try and kill me .
but then you &apos;d have to face your real problems--
like the fact that stefan invited me here himself .
i guess he likes me again .
looks like someone forgot her team @-@ building exercises .
i &apos;m not apologizing for not wanting her here .
you know , stefan just brought her here
to make it seem like he &apos;s moving on .
he wants you to think that he &apos;s over you
and he wants me to think that i can &apos;t get under her skin .
you know , you &apos;re right .
with any luck ,
i &apos;ll only have to tolerate her for a few more days
and then we &apos;ll find the cure
and i &apos;ll never have to deal with her again .
human rebekah .
can &apos;t imagine her without fangs .
you know ...
you &apos;ve never talked about
what you &apos;ll do with the cure once we find it .
will you take it ?
i don &apos;t like to speculate .
sorry . if there was a less awkward way to do this ,
i would .
doesn &apos;t bother me .
these symbols must have been left for the hunters
so they could find the cure ,
and this must be the story of qetsiyah and silas .
according to shane , silas asked qetsiyah for help
making a spell for immortality .
she helped make him immortal ,
only to learn he planned to use the same spell on another woman ,
not her
when she found out , she freaked .
so , qetsiyah killed the other woman ?
yeah . silas was immortal .
she couldn &apos;t kill him .
so , she trapped him in a cave and buried him alive instead .
does it say anything about the hunter &apos;s purpose in all this ?
i was wondering when you &apos;d ask .
qetsiyah created a cure for immortality
and then she buried it with silas ,
hoping that he &apos;d take it and die .
end up on the other side with her for all eternity .
but he wouldn &apos;t give her the satisfaction .
so , many centuries later ,
her descendants created the hunters
to find him , cure him , and kill him .
you know what ? i &apos;ll explain on the hike .
come on . we gotta get going .
morning , sunshine .
you look pathetic .
only until bonnie &apos;s spell locking me in here wears off .
then i &apos;ll look different .
angrier , perhaps .
or , i won &apos;t look like anything ,
because i &apos;ll have gouged your eyeballs from their sockets .
my friends will be back with the cure by then .
so , i could shove it down your throat and make you mortal .
i &apos;m an original .
what makes you think my entire vampire bloodline
won &apos;t be cured along with me ?
i.e. , you .
you know what i think ?
i think that &apos;s impossible .
i think the moment you stop being a vampire ,
our whole blood connection to you is broken ,
and your sire @-@ line ceases to exist .
so , whatever happens to you ,
happens only to you ,
which means i can kill your ass and no one else has to die .
although i am still debating just how to do it .
i recommend drowning .
there &apos;s nothing quite like the feeling of
someone fighting for something as basic as human breath .
and let me tell you , your mother was a fighter .
satellite phone lost its signal .
that &apos;s a good sign .
is anyone else a little creeped out ?
so , then leave .
out of everyone , your presence is the least necessary .
please don &apos;t start .
i &apos;m merely stating the facts .
jeremy has the spell on his body .
bonnie &apos;s the witch that unseals the cure .
shane is the human compass .
you and i have the tombstone , which does god knows what .
and elena has no point .
what about me ?
you have a nice behind .
centuries after qetsiyah died ,
there were these miners who were excavating a well on the island .
suddenly went mad .
bled themselves dry . no apparent reason .
so , the legend spread that these miners ,
in exchange for a drop of their blood ,
saw visions of their lost loved ones in the well they were digging .
the word traveled
and explorers sought out the well to see if the legend was true .
so , the well was magic ?
yeah . some people believe the voices of lost souls
were just a wind vortex whipping through caves .
and visions were caused by
inhaling the island &apos;s poisonous plant life .
and what do you believe ?
i believe in magic .
my wife and my son died within months of each other .
and so ... i decided to try the well out for myself .
i offered up my blood and waited .
hello ? hello ?
atticus .
caitlin . caitlin ? caitlin ?
hello , atty .
caitlin .
i saw my wife .
i saw her eyes .
her smile .
my blood let me see her again .
yeah , got it .
don &apos;t eat the poisonous flowers .
wait . stop . stop ! stop .
is everybody paying attention ?
our first lesson in survival .
stay together . keep your eyes open .
i &apos;m out of water .
here . take mine .
magic well ? seriously ?
i don &apos;t know . i mean ...
we &apos;ve all lost someone .
the chance to maybe see them again ?
i kinda get it .
jeremy !
what the hell just happened ?
somebody just saved my life .
what is this place ?
according to island lore ,
a group of college kids came here for spring break .
a few weeks later , they were all found dead ,
completely drained of blood .
well , tragic for them , brilliant for us .
who sleeps where ?
well , that &apos;s lovely .
there &apos;s a mystery man with a hatchet lurking in the woods
and we &apos;re just gonna camp ?
we &apos;re safer here than we are hiking in the dark .
let &apos;s just keep going . you know ?
get the cure . get in , get out .
where is it ?
how stupid do you think i am ?
stupid enough to raise an immortal witch ,
so i &apos;d say ... incredibly .
yeah , i &apos;m shocked you even want the cure ,
considering you &apos;ve got the most to lose once elena &apos;s human .
shane doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s talking about .
we &apos;ll find out tomorrow .
do you really think i &apos;m gonna take this cure ,
break the sire bond , and fall out of love with you ?
no . i &apos;m saying we don &apos;t know .
and if we find it tomorrow , we will .
this cure is gonna change so many things .
jeremy &apos;s not gonna want to kill me anymore .
we &apos;re finally gonna get rid of klaus .
bonnie &apos;s mom isn &apos;t gonna be a vampire .
and anyone who wants to take this cure is gonna have that option .
caroline , stefan , and you .
if you want it .
i get it . everything changes tomorrow .
it &apos;ll be all unicorns and rainbows .
no , not everything . that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .
damon , not my feelings for you .
you &apos;re still here ? what are you doing ?
gloating .
hello , caroline .
come home .
don &apos;t stoop to his level .
he destroyed my life .
i plan on being present for every second of his misery
until i can kill him myself .
fine . you can gloat and multitask .
this place is a disaster .
starting with a horrific burnt corpse .
tyler &apos;s mother is dead . so is my brother .
we &apos;re even .
call bonnie
and get her to let me out of here .
i will never , ever , help you .
how quickly you forget the part
where i saved tyler from the misery of being a werewolf .
or the night your mother invited me into her home
to save the life of her precious daughter .
how delusional are you ?
you killed his mother .
and let &apos;s not forget that we &apos;re standing in a house
where elena &apos;s aunt jenna used to live .
or did you think that your charm would make us forget
how you killed her , too ?
you know what ? no . i am not going to engage in this .
you are not even worth the calories i burn talking to you .
no !
now , that was definitely worth the calories .
well , 7 of us and no one thought to bring s &apos;mores .
what are you doing with that ?
we &apos;re a day away from finding the cure .
not letting it out of my sight .
do you hear that ?
i swear this place is haunted .
um ... you &apos;re crushing my arm .
ok . you got me . i &apos;m a scaredy cat .
you do realize you &apos;re an original vampire , right ?
which is precisely why you should stop teasing me .
i &apos;m very powerful .
what are you gonna do when elena becomes human
and comes running back to you ?
you said that you &apos;d take the cure to be with her .
you &apos;d have children and grow old .
is it still true ?
why do you want to take it ?
aren &apos;t you the perfect vampire ?
isn &apos;t it obvious ?
it &apos;s all an act , stefan .
being a vampire is miserable .
i would give anything to be human .
normal .
if i take the cure ... it wouldn &apos;t be for her .
it &apos;d be for me .
i &apos;ve been staring at pictures of jeremy &apos;s tattoo
and there &apos;s no spell .
expression doesn &apos;t require a written spell .
just think of it as a way of
accessing magic that already exists inside you .
you just have to want it bad enough .
and i &apos;m just supposed to trust you ?
bonnie , listen , i taught you expression
so that you could access the cure .
i &apos;ll be right there with you the whole time . promise .
you didn &apos;t answer the trust part .
all right . let me put it this way .
you need me to help you through it , bonnie .
and as you &apos;ve demonstrated , expression can get messy .
believe me when i say i &apos;ve seen it get a lot worse .
how much worse ?
when we lost our son in the car accident , my wife kind of lost it .
she tried to resurrect his body using magic .
your wife was a witch ?
she was a powerful witch .
and incredibly undisciplined .
and you never thought to tell me ?
i just didn &apos;t want to scare you .
the truth is , she tried to bring our son back using expression ,
and it overwhelmed her , and she died .
you taught me the same magic that killed your wife ?
yeah , but look , the upside is ,
i &apos;ve learned the warning signs , all right ?
i can keep expression from consuming you .
downside is , you turned her into a bomb that only you can dismantle .
don &apos;t you think i know how this ends ?
i came here to raise silas
so that he could bring back the dead ,
but you &apos;re never gonna let that happen .
the second i point to a cure , you &apos;re gonna kill me .
now bonnie has to keep me alive
so that i can keep her alive .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
oh , my god . oh , my god . oh , my god .
look at me . look at me .
i can fix this .
how ? the only thing
that can heal me is his blood .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
i know .
i &apos;ll fix it .
she &apos;ll die if you don &apos;t heal her .
ok .
beg me to save her life .
this is what you want ?
to remind me that i &apos;m powerless against you ?
fine . you win . i &apos;m nothing .
now , save her . please .
i &apos;m sorry , mate . i didn &apos;t quite catch that .
please .
please ...
please save her life .
see , now i think you &apos;re just telling me what i want to hear .
i mean , you did call me pathetic earlier .
and wouldn &apos;t it be more pathetic of me to help now ,
knowing that hours ago , you announced
your plan to kill me in a manner in which you &apos;re still debating
because you want it to have a certain amount of flair ?
i &apos;m just asking .
i &apos;ll be your slave again .
i &apos;ll do whatever you want .
just help her .
no .
get me out of here .
i can &apos;t even look at him .
come on .
jeremy !
did you find anything ?
he &apos;s not on the trail .
his gear &apos;s still here .
he &apos;s not at the quarry , either .
split up .
i &apos;m gonna stay and try a locator spell .
ok . i &apos;ll stay here . i &apos;ll make sure she &apos;s safe .
i &apos;ll stay here and make sure you &apos;re not lying .
fine . we &apos;ll keep searching the island .
thought it didn &apos;t work .
yeah . i &apos;m just ... just checking the signal .
so you can call someone ?
like whoever took jeremy ?
this place has a habit of getting to you , doesn &apos;t it ?
see for yourself .
i &apos;m done trusting you .
uhh ! where &apos;s the cure ?
you know that magical well i was telling you about ?
silas and the cure are buried deep below it .
so , you &apos;ve seen it ?
no .
but you could say i heard it from a reliable source .
caitlin .
how is this happening ?
you &apos;re bleeding .
what ?
oh , my god . oh , my god .
no . it &apos;s good . it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s what &apos;s keeping me here .
if a single drop of blood can give you a vision ,
could you imagine what two liters could do ?
what does your dead wife have to do with a cure ?
she got nothing to do with a cure ,
but she has everything to do with silas .
i &apos;m so sorry i let things get out of control .
i should &apos;ve stopped you .
sweetheart , it &apos;s ok .
you wanted sam back as much as i did .
what if you had a second chance to bring us both back ?
i can &apos;t , baby . i &apos;m not a witch .
we have a witch .
his name is silas .
if you set him free ,
he &apos;ll help those who have helped him .
set him free from ... from what ?
he &apos;s entombed in the caves below us ,
but it &apos;s impossible to get him out without a spell .
you need to get the spell .
and that &apos;s when she explained
everything that i had to do .
complete the hunter &apos;s mark to access the spell
and empower a descendant of qetsiyah to perform it .
bonnie bennett &apos;s related to this crazy @-@ ass witch ?
jeremy !
jeremy !
why don &apos;t you yell louder ?
maybe we haven &apos;t drawn enough attention to ourselves .
i &apos;m sorry , and how are you helping ?
i &apos;m stronger than you and faster than you
and i &apos;m quite certain i can charm the islanders
a lot easier than you .
not disagreeing on the easy part .
all right , we get it . you two hate each other .
can we just keep going , please ?
i tried being her friend ,
but somehow , i ended up with a dagger in my back
because i &apos;m the evil one .
technically , you didn &apos;t achieve evil status
until you killed me .
nice catch .
thank you .
no , actually , thank you .
this thing would &apos;ve killed me .
i don &apos;t care what happens to you either way .
but if you &apos;re gonna die , it might as well be epic .
i &apos;m gonna go back and check on bonnie ,
see if she found anything .
be careful .
you have the rock , hunter , bennett witch .
what about the dozens that died in sacrifice ?
where do they fit in to all this ?
as you can imagine , that was not an easy pill to swallow .
caitlin , it &apos;s me ,
the guy who refused to serve a meat course at our wedding .
i can &apos;t--i can &apos;t orchestrate 3 massacres .
it isn &apos;t like that .
you &apos;re merely leading these people
so silas can bring them back from the dead .
why--why should they die just to be resurrected ?
it doesn &apos;t make sense .
the spell that brings me back
requires a witch to channel
an extreme amount of mystical energy .
energy that doesn &apos;t occur in nature .
because it isn &apos;t natural .
i &apos;m sorry , cate .
i just--i can &apos;t do that to innocent people .
can you feel my touch ?
how is this possible ?
because you believe it is possible .
you believe that you can see me again .
you don &apos;t have to take a single
human life yourself , atticus .
all you have to do is convince someone
to believe that it is possible
that they can see a lost loved one again .
and they &apos;ll do it for you .
which is how you manipulated the pastor
to blow up a farmhouse full of people .
he just wanted to see his wife again .
we need 3 massacres .
fire at the young farm .
holiday hybrid slaughter .
what mass blood @-@ letting am i forgetting ?
you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re not finished .
is that why you brought us all out here
in the middle of nowhere ?
massacre number 3 ?
it doesn &apos;t work that way , damon .
i think you need to tell me
where this magical well is .
you know i can &apos;t do that .
oh , i know .
i know .
it &apos;s getting worse .
i &apos;m sorry .
no .
it &apos;s my fault . i &apos;m sorry .
no . you didn &apos;t do any of this .
i unsired the hybrids
and turned them on klaus .
i should &apos;ve just left it alone .
you freed them , tyler .
people put their faith in you
because you &apos;re a leader .
don &apos;t forget that .
then you trust me ?
you want to be in control , klaus ? here .
now you get to be in control of her life .
if you want her to die , fine .
but then you can sit here
and watch her die yourself .
nothing personal , love .
if i kill you , that means victory for him .
don &apos;t worry . it won &apos;t be long now .
where &apos;s the cure ?
does it matter ?
i think we both know you &apos;d rather just torture me .
torture gives you a sense of control ,
especially with your relevance slipping away .
i look at you . here you are ,
hours from elena breaking her sire bond .
start to freak out a little bit .
listen , you want my advice ? leave . go .
don &apos;t put yourself through this .
oh ! fine . ok .
let &apos;s say her feelings for you are real .
how does that end ?
she &apos;s human . you &apos;re a vampire .
stop !
mm . it &apos;s doomed , damon .
see , you &apos;re not torturing me , man .
you &apos;re torturing yourself by helping them find the cure .
i could kill you .
then no one would find it .
we &apos;ve established that you can &apos;t kill me
without sending bonnie off the deep end .
you can leave the island .
have a modicum of self @-@ respect .
don &apos;t stay here and watch elena walk away from you .
right .
because if i &apos;m not here ,
then i can &apos;t get in between you
and whatever you &apos;re planning with silas .
i &apos;m not that easily manipulated , professor .
and there is one flaw in your logic .
i don &apos;t give a crap about bonnie bennett .
what is wrong with you ?
what did you say to him ?
your boyfriend &apos;s a maniac , elena .
stop messing with my friends .
shane is the only thing that &apos;s keeping bonnie safe ,
and you try to kill him ?
and you wonder why bonnie hates you .
i don &apos;t wonder , elena , because i don &apos;t care .
i don &apos;t care about her .
i don &apos;t care about some lame @-@ ass cure for vampires , either .
how can you say that right now ?
because i don &apos;t want you to be cured .
i &apos;m not fighting with you about this anymore .
being human isn &apos;t gonna change my feelings for you .
fine . say they &apos;re real .
say you &apos;ve become human and you still love me .
then what ?
you grow old . you die .
i stay a vampire .
face reality , elena . we don &apos;t work .
so , things aren &apos;t easy
and you &apos;re just gonna push me away now ?
that &apos;s what you do , damon .
you think that you don &apos;t--
you don &apos;t deserve something , so you ruin it .
i &apos;m not gonna let you pull that this time .
take the cure with me .
that &apos;s how much i know this is real .
that &apos;s how certain i am that
i &apos;m going to love you
even after this is all over .
take the cure .
be human with me .
we can be together . grow old together .
this doesn &apos;t have to be hard anymore .
that &apos;s not me , elena . that &apos;s stefan .
i used to miss being human .
now i can &apos;t think of anything more miserable on earth .
haven &apos;t we been through here before ?
it all looks the same to me .
thanks . but that wouldn &apos;t have killed me .
sorry . force of habit .
don &apos;t be a tease .
elena could be lurking somewhere in the woods .
do you mean what you said ?
about a cease @-@ fire ?
why do you all assume that i hate elena so much ?
well , i mean , you did run her off a bridge .
you all seem to forget that elena &apos;s death
was the only way to save my family .
i did the same thing that every one of you would &apos;ve done
to protect the people that you love .
and before you cast me as the bad guy ,
maybe you should remember that elena &apos;s helped to kill
not one but two of my brothers .
maybe we &apos;re not as different as everyone &apos;s making us out to be .
jeremy &apos;s not here . i &apos;m going back .
bonnie ?
where is everyone ?
what are you talking about ?
bonnie is not here and shane &apos;s stuff is all gone .
oh , my god .
the tombstone &apos;s gone .
if you don &apos;t feed me your blood , i &apos;ll die .
then you &apos;ll die ,
and tyler will have learned his lesson the hard way .
how could you do this to him ?
to his mom ? to me ?
i &apos;m a thousand years old . call it boredom .
i don &apos;t believe you .
fine . then maybe it &apos;s because i &apos;m pure evil ,
and i can &apos;t help myself .
no .
it &apos;s because you were hurt .
which means that there is a part of you that is human .
how could you possibly think that ?
because i &apos;ve seen it .
because ... i &apos;ve caught myself wishing
that i could forget all the horrible things that you &apos;ve done .
but you can &apos;t . can you ?
i know that you &apos;re in love with me .
and anybody capable of love
is capable of being saved .
you &apos;re hallucinating .
i guess i &apos;ll never know .
caroline .
caroline .
what are you doing in my tent ?
where &apos;s the tombstone ? what have you done with it ?
what are you talking about ?
like it &apos;s not bloody obvious ?
all you people ever do is betray me and here you go again .
let her go . she didn &apos;t take it .
was any of this real ?
was it just a ploy to distract me
while shane ran off with the tombstone ?
you think i would do that ?
you think i would let some psychopath run off with the cure ?
every single moment of my last 146 years
has been ruled by the pain of being a vampire .
and this cure ends that .
it ends the guilt and it ends the suffering .
and you really think i would jeopardize that ?
fine . you didn &apos;t take it .
but that doesn &apos;t mean i trust her .
i didn &apos;t take it , but here .
consider this a peace offering .
don &apos;t you get it , elena ? there is no peace .
we &apos;re all screwed .
exactly , rebekah . we &apos;re screwed .
bonnie &apos;s gone . shane &apos;s got the tombstone .
jeremy &apos;s missing
who knows if damon &apos;s coming back .
so , us 3 right here , this is all we &apos;ve got .
so , we &apos;re either in this together ...
or it &apos;s over .
for all of us .
jeremy .
was a bit of a scare yesterday .
thanks for fending off his attacker .
his attacker ?
jeremy was attacked by an islander .
i assume hatchet fling guardian angle .
no , it wasn &apos;t me .
well , i guess there &apos;s somebody else on this island
who is desperate to keep our hunter alive .
how do i get here .
what the hell is going on ?
i see your locater spell work .
the path behind me just ...
magically disappear . you &apos;d thank the talented masaque .
he &apos;s a witch .
should you try to escape
we &apos;ll make sure you never find your way back .
so , gang &apos;s all here .
silas awaits .
you got to be kidding me .
