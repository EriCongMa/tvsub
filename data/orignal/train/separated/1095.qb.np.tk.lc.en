is this what you &apos;re looking for ?
ezra is taking on these big responsibilities .
and he needs a job .
the park rangers found a body .
it was toby .
no , spence , it wasn &apos;t .
will you just tell me that what i saw tonight wasn &apos;t real ?
please tell me .
i &apos;m here to pick up malcolm .
your friend picked me up instead .
she said her name was alison .
they just found a body tonight .
where ?
exactly where spencer said it was .
i don &apos;t think that i can do this , anymore .
look at all that &apos;s happened since you turned me down on
our little drive up the mountain .
you don &apos;t have to ask me again , mona .
i &apos;m in .
she knows we &apos;re down here , right ?
maybe she &apos;s just as nervous about seeing us as
we are about seeing her .
guys , she &apos;s the exact same spencer that we saw last week .
no , the spencer we saw in radley was not the spencer i know .
that was before .
em , we &apos;re not just here for her ,
we &apos;re for you , too .
do we talk about him ?
do we bring it up ?
i don &apos;t want to say anything that could put her back there .
i know the cops said they found toby .
but they sent that second body to the state coroner
for a reason .
i mean , maybe there &apos;s hope .
you know how i feel about hope .
breeds eternal misery .
we lost toby a long time ago .
we just didn &apos;t know it .
oh , you &apos;ve got to love the hastings .
i just get released from a mental hospital ,
and they welcome my friends with tea and crumpets .
what &apos;s the difference between a crumpet and an english muffin ?
hanna , does it matter ?
i &apos;m just making conversation .
an english muffin is a baked bread . it &apos;s made of dough .
and a crumpet is a griddle cake .
it &apos;s made of batter .
how are you , spence ?
i &apos;m all right .
you know , you don &apos;t have to pretend to be okay for us .
yeah , if this was the act you had to pull off to get out of there ,
then ...
do you remember when you were in the light house , emily ?
and you had to make that choice ?
it was either him or you ?
i wasn &apos;t as strong as you were .
when i saw toby in the woods ,
like that , i just gave up .
so what changed ?
you seem like you &apos;re back to yourself .
i decided i didn &apos;t want to be victim anymore .
that &apos;s not who i am .
here .
what &apos;s this ?
周五晚上八点
my parents told all of their friends that
i went to radley for exhaustion ,
so they want to throw
a soiree to make sure that everybody knows that i &apos;m all better now .
could really use some support .
can you guys please come ?
of course .
sure . yeah , you know we &apos;d do anything for you .
i &apos;m counting on that .

第三季 第二十四集
did malcolm tell you what she looked like ?
no , he just said she was a friend of mine ,
and her name was alison . that &apos;s all i know .
well , look--you have to talk to him , find out more .
yeah , like does she have dark hair , horns , and a tail ?
guys , no , we are not using malcolm to get to mona .
you know , the last time i saw ezra
i could hardly face him .
all we have to do is show mona &apos;s picture to the kid .
he &apos;ll confirm that mona took him and the cops will
take our lulu head back to the nut farm .
hanna .
sorry , spence . my bad .
i don &apos;t know , it seems like a really
bold move for mona .
the risk being seen like that ?
what are you saying , spence ?
it feels desperate .
like maybe she &apos;s trying to get caught .
okay , well , malcolm is off limits , okay ?
gotta get to class .
i can use some extra money .
did you not just hear aria ?
em , kids love me . i &apos;ll make a game out of it .
hey , emily .
what @-@ uh @-@ what are you doing here ?
our coach arranged for us to practice here this morning .
but i say if it &apos;s water , it &apos;s wet , right ?
a pool &apos;s a pool .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;ve met .
uh , shana , this is spencer .
uh , you swim for oakwood ?
amongst other things . will you be at the meet ?
yeah . wouldn &apos;t miss it .
i &apos;ll look for you . good luck , emily .
you , too .
i hate her .
why ?
because she flirts with everyone but me .
shana &apos;s bad news .
wherever she goes , trouble follows .
well , it was great seeing you .
take care .
hey .
hey .
did you have another interview ?
yeah , they called this morning .
well , that &apos;s good .
probably means that they &apos;re interested
in having you back .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to work out for me .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
you said you were going to make it all go away .
i &apos;m worried that the police have evidence .
look , i need to see you today .
i &apos;ve got to go . bye .
i just got off the phone with your mom .
did you know that ezra was applying for
a teaching job at rosewood high ?
yeah , he applied for a job subbing in the district .
listen , your mom and i recognize that ezra
needs to find a way to support his son .
but he cannot teach in
rosewood if you two are still seeing each other .
your leaving us no choice--
dad , slow down , okay . he &apos;s not getting the job .
he was offered the position this morning , aria .
ezra asked for the day to decide if he wants to take it .
so , aria didn &apos;t tell me that you were interested in the job .
oh , well , i didn &apos;t tell her because i didn &apos;t want
to feel pressured if you gave me the gig .
thank you .
so , malcolm &apos;s seven , right ?
what &apos;s he into ? fast cars and fast girls ?
it &apos;s a joke .
he &apos;s into trains .
oh ! well , all aboard the hanna express .
um , do you have a resume , or anything ?
honestly , i haven &apos;t baby sat since i was 15 .
but my mom &apos;s in new york , caleb &apos;s out of town ,
so , i have a lot of time to kill .
and i could use the extra money .
okay . i have an appointment tonight ,
so , if you &apos;re free ,
we can give it a test run .
see if it &apos;s a good fit .
well , it will be , promise .
i &apos;ve missed you .
they &apos;ll all be together this friday .
you know what you need to do .
yeah . what did the doctor say about your eyes ?
um , i &apos;ll have good days and bad days .
eventually they &apos;ll all be bad .
on your darkest days ,
you know i &apos;ll be here for you .
is everything okay ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me that they offered you the job ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t think i &apos;m going to take it .
and i didn &apos;t think you
should share in the burden of that decision .
you need a job , ezra .
but you know what would happen to us
if i end up back at rosewood .
things are different now . people know about us .
hey , don &apos;t--don &apos;t cry . don &apos;t cry .
we &apos;re okay .
no , we &apos;re not .
nothing about us feels right anymore .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s not your fault .
i want to fix this .
i know .
i know , but you can &apos;t .
okay , we &apos;ve been chasing after what we used to have
ever since you found out about malcolm , but ...
i just don &apos;t--
i don &apos;t think that we can ever get that back .
things aren &apos;t easy , but they can still be good .
it shouldn &apos;t be this hard .
if you &apos;re not happy anymore ...
you know , that &apos;s what matters most to me .
hey , i love you just as much as i always have .
and that &apos;s why i want you to take this job .
aria , wait , wait .
i love you .
evening , ma &apos;am .
it &apos;s seat yourself , pretty eyes .
hanna got the job .
i know .
spencer .
when i was in radley ,
mona told me that you were alive .
i wanted to believe her , but until now ...
back in the woods ,
was that you ?
were you a part of it ?
mona told me after .
and you let me believe that you were dead ?
everything i &apos;ve done , was so i could protect you .
i want to believe that .
let me take you somewhere safe .
does mona know you &apos;re here ?
no .
she told me you &apos;d be there friday .
that you &apos;d be my reward for delivering the girls .
how &apos;d you find me ?
she left me alone in her lair .
i kidnapped a seven @-@ year @-@ old .
i &apos;m the reason that aria and ezra broke up .
so , i &apos;ve earned her trust .
it &apos;s not safe for you to be here .
i stopped worrying about me a long time ago .
what we had was real .
i &apos;ve been pretending to work with mona
so i could keep you safe .
i need you to believe me .
and i need you to follow me .
what happened to rex ?
do you want to play a game ?
come on , it &apos;ll be fun .
my dad said i can watch cartoons .
fine .
but you should know that watching tv rots your brain .
it &apos;s your choice if you want to grow up to be stupid .
just sayin &apos; .
okay , let &apos;s play &quot; guess who . &quot;
i &apos;ll show you a picture of a person ,
and you tell me if you know them .
okay .
that &apos;s aria .
see . you &apos;re good at this .
okay .
do you know her ?
she didn &apos;t take you to the carnival ?
i went with aria &apos;s friend , alison .
is this alison ?
nope .
what about this ?
nope .
what about this person ?
that &apos;s a boy .
i am going to go call my friend really quick .
can i play a game on your phone ?
sure .
i struck out .
he &apos;s seven . maybe he &apos;s confused .
hanna . i gotta call you back .
i don &apos;t understand , they have the tapes and that can &apos;t--
no , i do understand , but those bitches
are going to be at the lodge at nine .
do you understand ?
yes , i do .
shana is right .
i &apos;ve told her , she didn &apos;t listen .
doesn &apos;t look like anybody lives here .
i shuffle between a few motels .
mona doesn &apos;t know about this one .
and red coat ?
the only thing i know about red coat is that she &apos;s in charge .
i know .
you still don &apos;t trust me .
look , i understand
why you &apos;ve been helping mona .
i made the same decision .
but if i saw you hurting ,
the way that i know you saw me ...
toby .
no wonder i was a fat kid .
when my dad cheated on my mom and left us to start a new family ,
i had a box of these a night .
but i would get some peanut butter
and that frosting in a can and have a party .
alison &apos;s right here .
what ?
she &apos;s in this picture .
i don &apos;t remember that .
it just popped up .
that can &apos;t be who you saw .
that &apos;s aria &apos;s friend , alison .
no , malcolm , that girl &apos;s--
i remember her pretty hair .
that &apos;s her , hanna . with the blue shirt .
spencer ?
that &apos;s alison .
he said she was the girl in the blue shirt .
this is crazy .
and you &apos;re saying , that shana knows jenna .
and that the both of them are meeting up with melissa ?
this is crazier than crazy .
i mean , radley &apos;s looking better every day .
i &apos;m actually ready to check in .
we &apos;re going to figure it out .
i &apos;ve already got it figured out .
spencer &apos;s part of the a @-@ team . game over .
today it &apos;s me and ezra . tomorrow it &apos;ll be you and caleb .
and then it &apos;s going to be your turn emily ,
so get ready to say goodbye to paige ,
&apos;cause i promise you , a &apos;s going to take her from you .
why would spencer do this to us ?
guys , i don &apos;t believe for one second
that spencer &apos;s on the a @-@ team .
okay , if she is working with mona
then there has to be more to the story .
we don &apos;t know what happened in radley .
but spencer went in there at rock bottom .
and she came out like a shiny new penny .
are you thinking shock treatment ?
no . no , i &apos;m saying that
mona spent a lot of time in radley .
and maybe she made some friends .
and maybe spencer talked to some of those friends .
mona asked spencer to join the a @-@ team
on the night of the masquerade ball .
did spencer finally take her up on it ?
yeah , but why now ?
there &apos;s a way to prove
that spencer &apos;s still with us ,
and if mona &apos;s watching ,
it won &apos;t put spencer at risk .
really , hanna ? you &apos;re in the mood for a dance party ?
look , a was everywhere
before spencer joined the a @-@ team .
do you really think we &apos;re meeting in secret ?
aria .
i took the job .
you remember what you said at ali &apos;s funeral ?
you were right . there never was a happy ending for us .
you know , this doesn &apos;t have to be forever .
you &apos;re graduating in seven months .
and i wish that i could hold onto that .
but , it &apos;s too hard .
i need to move on , and so do you .
bye , ezra .
the red devil is gonna win and here they come .
here comes the shark , close behind .
and what a win for the red devils !
what is this ?
you followed me here , that means you don &apos;t
know who she is , either .
and if you don &apos;t know who she is ,
that means you &apos;re still one of us .
look , spence , whatever it is ,
no matter how deep you &apos;re into this ,
you know that you can tell us the truth , right ?
we want to help you .
mona came to see me at radley .
and when i found toby in the woods ,
she &apos;d planned the whole thing .
she wanted to break me so that she could
put me back together . like her own humpty dumpty .
so , mona made you an offer you couldn &apos;t refuse ?
she told me that toby was still alive .
toby &apos;s alive ?
and it &apos;s true .
it &apos;s true , he &apos;s been working with mona because
he found out about red coat
and mona &apos;s the only person who knows who she is .
and you &apos;ve seen him ?
yeah .
last night .
he &apos;s on our side . you guys , he always was .
but this party tomorrow , it &apos;s a set @-@ up .
red coat just wants us all to be together .
why ? what &apos;s she gonna do to us ?
i don &apos;t know .
but we &apos;re not going to let it happen .
okay , whatever it is , we &apos;re one step ahead of her ,
finally , and there are two of us on the inside .
and when were you going to clue us in on
your double agent status , nikita ?
i &apos;m the one who sent you the picture of me and ali .
and you did exactly what i needed you to do .
because mona watches my every move .
you &apos;ve found a way to get to me without her knowing about it .
so , instead of red coat waiting for us tomorrow ,
we &apos;ll be waiting for her .
and if we &apos;re lucky , this will all be over with .
luck won &apos;t have anything to do with it .
all right , good morning .
my name is mister fitz .
and i &apos;m back as your substitute teacher .
uh , if we open up to chapter one ,
we &apos;ll find out why hemingway said ,
&quot; all things truly wicked , start from innocence . &quot;
it &apos;s perfect timing , actually .
i need a pick @-@ me @-@ up .
that place is really nice .
it &apos;s the hastings . were you expecting &quot; donuts and dogs &quot; ?
how can you afford new miu mius ?
oh ! i borrowed them .
the store gives full refunds for returns .
that &apos;s if you don &apos;t wear them .
doesn &apos;t say that on the receipt .
they &apos;re running late .
how late ?
they &apos;re on their way . that &apos;s all i know .
she &apos;s expecting all of you to be here .
and we will be .
you have no idea what she &apos;s capable of , spencer .
trust me . you don &apos;t want to disappoint her .
i saw them getting ready .
and i have the video you asked for .
they don &apos;t suspect anything .
you guys , i &apos;m serious about not
taking back those shoes .
hanna , quiet !
we &apos;ve got to get inside before red coat shows up .
if she knows we &apos;re onto her ,
we &apos;ll never find out who she is .
are we sure we trust toby ?
spencer does .
do we have a choice ?
it &apos;s all according to plan .
how far away are you ?
it &apos;s safe for you to land .
it &apos;s finally about to end .
you &apos;re getting what you &apos;ve always wanted .
she doesn &apos;t know the others aren &apos;t here yet .
i told you , they &apos;re coming .
why don &apos;t we for a walk while we wait ?
i &apos;ll take care of spencer .
toby ?
i know how you feel , spencer .
it sucks to be lied to .
get up .
i believed you .
i said get up !
you won &apos;t get away with this .
i &apos;d say &quot; watch me , &quot; but you won &apos;t be here to see it .
if something goes wrong ,
you know what you need to do .
going somewhere ?
you &apos;re making a terrible mistake .
that &apos;s not how we see it .
because you don &apos;t see .
you have know idea what &apos;s going on here .
we know enough .
who is that ?
get to the plane .
wait , toby !
be careful .
remember why we &apos;re here , spencer .
you see her . she doesn &apos;t see you .
what have you done ?
mona , try your phone .
nothing .
how can you not have a signal ? we saw you make a call .
it &apos;s her . don &apos;t you get it ?
she can do anything .
she &apos;s everywhere and she &apos;s nowhere .
come on , let &apos;s get out of here .
it &apos;s locked !
we &apos;re gonna die . we &apos;re all going to burn .
shut up , mona !
i &apos;m never going to know who she was .
what did you just say ?
red coat .
i don &apos;t know who she is either .
are you kidding ?
you guys , we have to get out of here .
ali ?
did anyone see her ?
see who ?
alison . she pulled me out of there .
she pulled us all out .
no , you &apos;re hallucinating .
she was here . i swear it .
ali &apos;s dead .
i saw her , too .
so did i.
ali is red coat .
so all of this started when you were at radley ?
i made a deal with the devil .
and she gave me a way in and out of that place .
at first it was fun , having a partner .
but then the game changed .
she stole you from me .
so what happened that night ?
were you there at the cemetery ?
did you drug me ? did you take ali &apos;s body ?
i don &apos;t know who drugged you .
but i was at the cemetery and so was red coat .
how could you not see who it was ?
she was wearing a mask .
she looked just like ali .
that &apos;s probably what happened tonight .
it wasn &apos;t ali . it was a mask .
guys ?
wait , is that ?
somebody pulled it out of the lake .
think this through , ashley .
how do you live with yourself ?
hey , we &apos;re not done here !
we have to get this out of here .
wait ! there &apos;s more .
it &apos;s jenna .
and shana ?
they know wilden ?
guys .
look at the trunk .
you &apos;re mine now .
kisses .
a.
