&quot; yolo &quot; ?

kirk van houten .
i hope you &apos;re not having a midlife crisis .

and started taking a dj class ,
everyone thinks i &apos;m having a midlife crisis .

look at me !
i &apos;m afraid of dying .
oh , homie .
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re happy
with your life just the way it is .
you &apos;ve had the same job , same car ,
same house for 20 years .
and that &apos;s all you &apos;ll ever have .
a cycle you &apos;ll never ever ,
ever , ever , ever ,
ever change .
and you &apos;re okay with it !
like i say night after night after night ...
nighty @-@ night .
kent brockman is here for your interview .
so , kent , what brings you here ?
the miraculous tale of how we lost , then found ,
our lost and found box ?
actually , principal skinner ,
i &apos;m here to talk about something else ...
cheating !
i thought this was a puff piece .
you &apos;re wearing a sweater .
this journalism just turned ...
gotcha !
that &apos;s right , channel 6 will uncover the truth
in a five @-@ part series two minutes a day .
people , make room for your local emmy nomination certificates .
no , do not make room .
except for mr. largo and his diet ,
there &apos;s no cheating in this school .
these 30 identical
&quot; what i did this summer &quot; essays say different .
内尔森 · 孟茨
wendell borton
lewis
苗浩斯 · 范浩腾
马丁 · 普林斯
拉尔夫 · 韦根
myra , don &apos;t i have another appointment ?
oh , this is your first appointment ever .
let &apos;s take a look at this monitor .
this school is more corrupt than the italian parliament .
if these children are our future ,
then i , for one , do not want to live .
please don &apos;t air this .
i &apos;ll tell you the winners of the kickball games in advance .
you can make a lot of cabbage betting on k @-@ ball .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;ll end the story with .
no !
this is kent brockman .
pleased with himself .
* you only live once *
* or so it seems *
* no life for yourself *
* and none for your dreams *
* you work every day *
* at a job so lame *
* and every night *
* the ending &apos;s the same *
* no dream will come true *
* you only live once *
yeah , well , at least you got your health , huh ?
now let &apos;s see if i can take that away from you .
your poison .
i &apos;m tired of living once .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying this ,
but i &apos;m starting to regret saying &quot; yolo . &quot;
marge , if you don &apos;t mind ,
i &apos;m gonna quit complaining about my life
and start wallowing in the past .
postage , marked in pesetas ?
who are those letters from ?
my old pen pal from spain .
eduardo .
back in fifth grade , you either had to write
to a foreigner or a prisoner .
i picked a foreigner because the prisoners
wrote back too fast .
we &apos;d write each other with our dreams of the future .
i was gonna be king of cheeseburger mountain .
did i change or did they stop making mountains out of cheeseburgers ?
probably a little bit of both .
so sad .
作弊 裙裤还是紧身裤
what kind of moral example is this dump for my boy ?
please , calm down , everyone .
you know , maybe this so @-@ called cheating scandal
is actually an opportunity to , uh ...
initiate a @-@ a dialogue
that would , uh , create a teachable moment .
uh , something , something buzz word ...
i got nothing .
quick , get a picture for the yearbook !
i have a solution !
you took your sweet time
coming to our rescue , lisa .
maybe the best way to keep students from cheating
is to trust them not to cheat .
that &apos;s it ? that &apos;s all you &apos;ve got ?
something i can read on a tea box ?
what i &apos;m suggesting is we create an honor code .
oh , swell , more work for the teachers .
the students would do it .
let her speak !
if every student pledges not to cheat ,
and to turn in any cheater ,
no one will cheat the system
because they &apos;ll be the system .
honor code ! honor code !
i did it .
i saved the day .
the same way i won that battle in vietnam .
by fainting !
if you &apos;re my wife &apos;s secret lover , come in .
there &apos;s nothing i can do for her anymore .
i am looking for my amigo de la pluma .
or &quot; pen pal . &quot;
eduardo ?
is it really you ?
why are you here ?
to save the soul of homer simpson .
now where is he , old man ?
i &apos;m homer simpson !
ay , dios mio !
what has happened to you ?
did your hair burn off in a fire
that trapped you in a candy factory ?
i wish .
marge simpson .
it &apos;s so nice to meet a friend
homer met through the mail who isn &apos;t a sea monkey .
yes , eduardo barcelona .
or in english , eddie miami .
homie , i thought a visit from your old pen pal
would cheer you up .
ah , how eagerly i would wait for a letter
from the estados unidos , and homer simpson .
&quot; buenos dias , eduardo . &quot;
笔友侯默 · 辛普森
what happened to us , eduardo ?
we had so many things we were going to do .
and i , my friend , have been doing them .
yeah , well , listen , pal .
i have my treasure--
my wife and my children .
i &apos;ve had eight wives and 200 children !
among them artists , doctors and revolutionary chefs .
do you have a disrespectful son
who calls you by your first name ?
i cannot imagine such a creature .
hey , homer . did you just fart ?
did you just fart , sir .
whatever .
easy , easy , homer .
i want to help you fulfill some of your childhood dreams .
really ? now ?
i have two pizzas coming .
i wanted to see who would get here first .
now , homer !
get your coat .
i asked him here to cheer you up .
but i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d drop everything to go gallivanting
with some , no offense , spaniard .
i promise you one thing , madam .
when i return your husband , he will be happy ,
bringing a new sense of adventure to your marriage ...
and to the bedroom .
i &apos;m not used to strange men
saying the word &quot; bedroom &quot; around me .
would you prefer , uh , &quot; sala de amor &quot; ?
that &apos;s even worse .
could you say it one more time ?
sala de amor .
hello , children .
i hold before you a copy of the school &apos;s new honor code .
i know if i can get the toughest kid in class to sign it ,
the rest of you will sign it .
milhouse ?
he &apos;s not the toughest kid , i am !
now , the smartest kid .
milhouse ?
he &apos;s not the smartest kid .
i am .
now the class nerd .
milhouse ?
homer , are you prepared to achieve the dreams of a ten year old ?
i took the liberty of crossing off the , uh , stupid ones .
now , this book of your childhood drawings will come to life .
why are you doing this ?
wait , are you in love with me ?
in love with the concept of you , yes .
woo @-@ hoo ! i &apos;m an attractive concept like liberty !
one more ride ?
all right .
don &apos;t forget to ring the bell .
剧目 : 《 彭赞斯海盗 》
i &apos;m sick of pirates off the street ruining my play !
i &apos;m going back to my old career !
care to see a dessert menu ?
we have the best cobbler since daniel day @-@ lewis .
cobbler即指 &quot; 馅饼 &quot; 又有 &quot; 工匠 &quot; 的含义
how much did this cost to restage ?
they rented everything from comic book guy for ten bucks .
don &apos;t stink up the gorn head .
i need it for a bar mitzvah later .
now don &apos;t forget , this is the first exam
under the new honor code .
they &apos;re doing it .
they &apos;re self @-@ proctoring .
can &apos;t you say anything in a normal way ?
the answer , sadly , is not yes .
i don &apos;t know what it is
about having all my dreams fulfilled ,
but i feel great !
oh , if you &apos;re happy i &apos;m happy .
what ?
that doesn &apos;t sound happy .
i feel kind of , oh ...
melancholy .
mmm , melon collie .
that &apos;s not helping .
well , what was your childhood dream ?
jumping on the bed .
but i never disobeyed my parents .
till i married you .
let &apos;s do it .
oh , i &apos;m a little tired .
could we just snuggle again ?
we do that every night !
come on !
jump on the bed !
ooh , okay !
can i help you , stranger ?
i am just watching my friend and his wife
innocently pleasure themselves in bed .
that sounds salty , but you seem sweet .
i &apos;m gonna call you kettle corn .
囤货小部分特卖
eduardo , i haven &apos;t felt this good in years .
you &apos;re like the tooth fairy .
except you don &apos;t collect human bones .
yes , yes . of course i don &apos;t .
here .
so , that &apos;s it ?
all my dreams , lived ?
eh ... all but one .
well , we &apos;ve got to do it !
i never leave a job unfinished .
it &apos;s as true now as that week
i worked on the high school yearbook .
so much infighting .
i had to get out of there .
all right , homer , we shall do this thing .
the editor put in like six pictures of this girl
&apos;cause she was his girlfriend .
everyone has a bad yearbook story .
they spelled my name wrong !
get over it ! ha !
so don &apos;t do what i did .
that concludes our safety video .
just step out that door
and you can glide to earth
like your boyhood hero ...
rocky the flying squirrel .
uh , actually , my hero
was the actress who provided rocky &apos;s voice ,
june foray .
a true legend in the voice @-@ over community .
i &apos;m just gonna stay on the plane
and think about her influence .
she has lived her life .
now , you must live yours .
no !
do not worry !
i will follow the trail of your fear !
will homer make it ?
or will he leave a crater the size
of the one that destroyed the yucatan ?
find out in our next exciting installment :
fat splat ...
or when you squish upon a car .
mmm , it &apos;s amazing .
every day has the peace and serenity of a flu outbreak .
guess i &apos;ll be getting some extra credit for this .
lisa , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ve gotten
all the extra credit we can give out .
so willie has been growing you a nice pumpkin .
here it is , lass .
you want me to carve it into a thank @-@ o &apos; -lantern ?
no , this is good .
well , this knife &apos;s got to carve something .
homer !
you don &apos;t have to flap .
just glide on the wind .
uh , okay .
flap ! flap ! flap ! flap ! flap ! flap !
yes , good , much better .
i got bart &apos;s backpack .
he got a hundred on his test ?
that &apos;s impossible .
is bart cheating ?
are the pope &apos;s tweets infallible ?
确认一下伟大的许愿蜡烛是否熄灭
bart , i &apos;m gonna tell !
no , you &apos;re not .
because if you tell people i cheated ,
that means your system failed .
oh , my god , you found a loophole !
why don &apos;t you put this much inventiveness into your work ?
because then i &apos;d be the one thing i swore i wouldn &apos;t .
you .
i &apos;m doing it !
i &apos;m flying like the squirrel
i always knew i was .
ooh , indigo !
homer ?
it &apos;s me , talking in your earphone .
come down , homie .
&quot; you only live once &quot;
also means when you die , you die !
what &apos;s going on ?
hello ?
are you mocking me ?
you can listen to your wife when you are dead .
savor the moment .
majestic eagle .
just like me , unashamed of his baldness .
so beautiful .
aw , he probably sees a mouse
he wants to tear in half .
stupid tallest building in springfield !
you &apos;ve presented me with quite a conundrum .
a word you should know
since it was on a vocabulary test you aced .
but after some thought , all my worries went away .
i know the answer .
i &apos;m gonna force you to turn yourself in .
good luck with that .
the only thing that &apos;ll change my mind
is a sign from god .
son , it was so beautiful !
i went faster than the speed of sound .
well , bart , is that enough of a sign for you ?
all right , i &apos;ll turn myself in .
it &apos;ll give me a chance to work some more
on the detention quilt .
this patch is for all the victims of atomic wedgies .
my friend , you &apos;ve lived your dreams .
no matter what , homer simpson has done it .
and soon i hope i remember who homer simpson is
and his relationship to me .
but i have no regrets .
in fact , all this has given me a sense of calm
i &apos;ve never had before .
that &apos;s the morphine .
can you give me the morphine forever ?
no way !
a person on morphine all the time
would constantly dissolve in inappropriate laughter .
eduardo ? eduardo ! eduardo !
it was all just a dream .
it was not just a dream .
and you said you &apos;d drive me to the airport .
oh , yeah .
great .
do i drop you at the curb or do i have to park and walk you in ?
go as far as your heart will take you .
you are a good friend .
* you only live once *
* but that &apos;s okay *
* you &apos;ll live quite long *
* in the usa ... *
* but back to my point *
* you only live once *
* you &apos;ve got years and years *
* unless it &apos;s just months . *
