aloha , lily .
aloha .
oh , wait . let &apos;s do it one more time .
the doggy was blocking her face .
yeah ,

no . no ! no .
we &apos;re not doing it a third time .
there she is- the prettiest white woman on maui . milady .
actually , claire and i were supposed to
go to hawaii for our honeymoon .
mm @-@ hmm .
but something else came up .
i got pregnant with haley .
my bad !
we didn &apos;t even have a proper wedding .
we just went down to the courthouse on a tuesday .
the judge sentenced me to life with no chance of parole .
you begged me to marry you .
it &apos;s true . i did .
oh ! hold on , my bride . allow me !
what are you doing ?
being romantic . god , you &apos;re solid .
sweetie , put me down . go on . okay .
honey , come on .
let &apos;s turn this vacation into a honeymoon .
sweet pea , i &apos;m a mom traveling with my kids .
for me , this is not a vacation .
it &apos;s a business trip . let &apos;s go .
this &apos;ll do .
it &apos;s beautiful .
aloha !
hi ! welcome to the four seasons maui .
what do you think , manny ?
i &apos;m home .
第一季第二十三集
i can &apos;t believe we have our own hotel room .
score ! there &apos;s an iron in here !
don &apos;t you want to keep our room neat ?
you know , in case we entertain .
who would we entertain ?
i noticed some lovely tweens down by the kids &apos; club .
maybe we can find a nice spot near them by the pool ...
and send over a couple of virgin mai tais .
they may be interested in two sophisticated men like us .
i am a bathroom martian !
i am from the nebula of the great toilet .
i want the biggest cheeseburger you got .
instead of salad , i want fries .
instead of fruit , i want chili fries .
haley , sweetie , put the phone down
and put on some sunscreen . please ?
we have got to stay on these kids all day ,
or else they &apos;re gonna burn .
totally .
they put on the littlest bit of sunscreen in the morning ,
they think it &apos;s got them covered for the-
are you watching gloria in my sunglasses ?
is she moving in slow motion , or is my brain doing that ?
phil , this is important .
go ahead . i &apos;m glistening .
hey , everybody .
we &apos;re on our way to see the world &apos;s largest banyan tree .
does anybody want to come ?
now , why in the hell would anyone want to leave paradise ,
take a hot bus ride to see a tree ?
the great thing about cameron is that ,
uh , he &apos;s adventurous , like i am .
we @-@ we both like to immerse ourselves in the culture
and really get to know the locals .
we &apos;ve made friends all over the world .
we &apos;re still in touch with elunga ,
a man we met on safari in tanzania .
we actually send him ... all of our old clothes .
he was a very nice man when we met him ,
but based on his recent letters ,
i have a small fear he &apos;s become a warlord .
hey . i &apos;m gonna go to the gym to work out a little bit .
you want to come with me ?
i just ordered an extra @-@ long straw
to avoid accidentally doing a sit @-@ up .
ah , look at this .
my brother .
what &apos;s up , jackass ?
happy birthday , you dumb son of a bitch .
birthday &apos;s tomorrow , moron !
i never understood this relationship .
so , 63 , right ?
hey , you can count !
you know dad was 63 when he died . huh ?
hello ?
thanks for reminding me .
ah , don &apos;t worry . he never took care of himself .
ate like crap and drank too much .
anyway , irene &apos;s begging me for-
hey , gloria , wait up . i &apos;m coming .
so , i was thinking we book a couples &apos; massage .
i accidentally looked in on one .
they seemed really relaxed until they noticed me .
haley , that &apos;s enough . get off the phone .
luke , pull up your trunks !
this bathing suit looks great on you .
thanks , sweetie . haley , come on . off the phone .
no way . keira got her hair straightened ?
claire , consider this a grand gesture of my love .
what are you-
oh , my god !
what did you do ?
phil , what are you thinking ?
that is an expensive cell phone .
it &apos;s just the beginning .
buckle your seat belt , lady . you &apos;re being wooed .
in nature , fathers are known to eat their young .
is it because they &apos;re delicious ? no .
it &apos;s because they want to give their female-
bear , giraffe , what have you-
the honeymoon they never had .
just to be clear , i &apos;m not condoning eating your kids ,
but i sure as heck know why giraffes do it .
what ?
come on , sleepy !
ay , jay !
come on , honey ! get out of bed !
i just booked us on an outrigger .
but it is your birthday .
you don &apos;t want to sleep in ?
come here .
no , no ,
i just came from the gym . guess how much i benched .
i don &apos;t know . 500 pounds ?
500 pounds ?
what am i , a forklift ?
to tell you the truth ,
that call from my brother scared the hell out of me .
i decided to get in better shape quick .
didn &apos;t want to end up like my old man .
although he did die doing what he loved-
refusing service to hippies who came into his store .
manny is the worst roommate ever .
everything he finds , he folds .
sweetie , it &apos;s only for a few more days .
last night we had a fire drill .
not the hotel . just us .
hi , guys .
hey .
so , what &apos;s today &apos;s big adventure ?
i &apos;ll bet the kids want to go with you .
well , it is a big one- the lavender ranch ,
where they grow 45 different varieties of lavender .
forty @-@ five .
hear that , kids ? forty @-@ five different varieties .
yeah , i can &apos;t sell that . go with god .
oh . well , more lavender for us .
when mitchell and i first met ,
i may have exaggerated my interest in adventurous travel ...
by implying that i had any .
but it &apos;s one of the things he loves most about me ,
and i can &apos;t tell him the truth now .
it would be like lewis telling clark
that he didn &apos;t like to walk .
side note .
we &apos;re very good friends with a couple named lewis and clark .
clark bought a big , sparkly belt in new orleans
that he calls his louisiana purchase .
mom , haley keeps stealing my ipod .
all my music is on my phone . what else am i supposed to do ?
manny watches the news .
you guys don &apos;t even watch the news .
aloha . hi . sorry , folks .
this pool is for adults only .
don &apos;t turn around .
what ?
trust me . just keep walking .
wait ! where are you guys going ?
guys ?
what just happened ?
ooh , so we can drink lavender tea
while eating lavender scones .
oh , neat ! so , is this an all @-@ day thing or-
oh , no . i know what you &apos;re thinking , cam .
don &apos;t worry . we &apos;ll still have time for the whaling village .
oh . good . so-
okay .
i can &apos;t .
what ?
i don &apos;t want to go .
i know i said
i &apos;m not a stay @-@ by @-@ the @-@ pool type of guy ,
but i really am , mitchell .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying that i like adventure ,
but not every minute of every day .
can you just go by yourself ?
but ... the lavender ranch-
it &apos;s- it &apos;s something two men are meant to do together .
on or off , folks ?
well , i &apos;m on .
i &apos;m off .
think about what you &apos;re missing , cam .
it &apos;s an entire ranch full of lavender .
you &apos;re not making the compelling case you think you are !
hey , you little monkey !
no standing around ! there you go !
here goes another one ! there you go !
here comes another one ! there you go !
i thought you were one of ours !
hey , jay ! be careful !
you &apos;re gonna hurt somebody- like you !
don &apos;t get too comfortable .
i reserved us a tennis court .
yay .
i thought that one of the advantages of marrying an older guy ...
was that i was going to be able to relax .
but all this swimming and running and rowing-
it &apos;s just like how some of my relatives got into this country .
you know- mmm .
you look prettier now than the day we got married .
oh , honey . and you are even more handsome .
i did push @-@ ups in the bathroom .
you &apos;re funny .
you &apos;re nice .
i have always been nice .
i &apos;ve always been funny .
well-
mom ! dad !
ignore her . that could be anyone .
phil and claire dunphy ?
yes , haley , honey ? what is it ?
i &apos;m gonna go get some shaved ice at the hotel
next door with some kids .
what kids ?
just some kids i met at the pool .
okay . um- i should go with her and
claire , no .
you have to learn to let go .
turning a family vacation into a honeymoon takes commitment .
you can do it . eye of the tiger .
hello !
i should at least meet them . i
no .
that is not eye of the tiger .
all right , haley , honey , go and have fun ,
but don &apos;t get in anybody &apos;s car ...
and be back in time for your grandfather &apos;s birthday dinner , okay ?
thank you !
okay ! all right !
bye , honey !
oh , god .
that feels weird and good all at once .
i know . i was leaning up against that nozzle a minute ago .
hey .
hey , you &apos;re back . how was it ?
ah ! cameron , it was the most incredible thing
i &apos;ve ever seen in my entire life .
really ?
you know who else was there ?
who
elton john .
no-
yes , and he was so blown away by the beauty of it ,
he sat down ... at their lavender piano
and played &quot; tiny dancer . &quot;
and we bonded , because he too likes adventure .
did that really happen ?
no , that didn &apos;t really happen .
i &apos;m just ...
trying to get back at you for bailing on me .
i &apos;m sorry . if it means anything ,
we &apos;ve been relaxing here doing nothing .
maybe you can join us tomorrow .
no , i can &apos;t- i just don &apos;t-
i don &apos;t find relaxing that relaxing .
i understand .
you are who you are .
leilani .
yes .
you know what ? i think it &apos;s because of my parents .
it always is . kipu !
i mean , vacation with my mom and dad
was them sitting around like statues ...
when , the only thing that me and claire could do for excitement was-
was sit around and listen to my skin sizzle .
you poor thing . sue ?
yes .
so , that &apos;s , like- that &apos;s why , when i &apos;m on vacation ,
i want to go out and meet the locals .
i want to immerse myself in the culture , you know ?
i don &apos;t want to sloth around- ah !
sweet lady gaga , that is good .
thank you .
what &apos;s this called ?
happiness .
i &apos;m curious . is there any sand left on the beach ,
or did you bring it all up to our bathroom ?
sorry , mom .
and now you &apos;re sitting on my linen jacket .
i guess i can &apos;t have nice things .
oh . i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t know it was there .
it &apos;s okay .
no ! stop !
i &apos;m wearing that tonight !
i &apos;m wrinkling your linen ! i &apos;m wrinkling your linen !
ooh ! you know what ? out !
i want you out ! this isn &apos;t working !
i don &apos;t care where you go , as long as you don &apos;t stay here !
what are you saying ?
what don &apos;t you understand about &quot; out &quot; ?
fine . i &apos;ll just move in with my sisters .
oh , no ! who will pee all over the bathroom floor ?
i was brushing my teeth at the same time .
you try to do that .
what &apos;d you do today ?
i napped .
you did ?
i haven &apos;t napped in years .
yeah . it feels good , doesn &apos;t it ?
mm @-@ hmm . good and weird .
kinda like that one nozzle in the infinity pool .
i wouldn &apos;t know . phil was hogging it .
is it me , or is lily more relaxed here ?
oh , yes . she is .
i think it &apos;s because she &apos;s really picking up on our energy , you know ?
it &apos;s like , if we &apos;re tense , she &apos;s gonna be tense .
and i think we need to bring this new energy home .
it &apos;s gonna make us better parents-
you blocked the
what ? what happened ?
you didn &apos;t bring her out !
i thought you had her !
come on . let me paint you .
oh , sweetie . that is so creepy .
where is everyone ?
okay . let me just say what everyone &apos;s thinking .
my jacket &apos;s a mess .
it wouldn &apos;t be ,
but someone used the iron to make grilled cheese .
i had bread , i had cheese and i had an iron .
what was i supposed to do ?
kids , kids . we don &apos;t care .
hola , hola !
hey . so sorry i &apos;m late . where is jay ?
he &apos;s not with you ?
no , he came down long time ago .
oh , don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll go have a look around .
yeah , he &apos;s probably in the ocean trying to
pull a tugboat with his teeth .
well , look who decided to join us .
and where is your sister ?
she is in our bathroom throwing up .
well , what happened ? -
you &apos;re not going to like this as much as i do ,
but she &apos;s drunk .
i @-@ i knew i never should have let her-
that &apos;s awesome .
guarantee our bathroom is still messier .
oh , my god ! lily ! where is the elevator ?
where- i don &apos;t know ! i &apos;m taking the stairs !
lily , we &apos;re coming for you !
hey , you . where you headed ?
well , remember earlier in the pool when you convinced me ...
to let haley go next door with complete strangers ?
and you were totally on board .
yeah . mm @-@ hmm . yeah , well ,
she got drunk , and now she &apos;s upstairs throwing up .
but she &apos;s just a kid . who would serve her ?
we did , honey . on a silver platter .
you convinced me to relax and let go ,
and now this happens .
i &apos;m sorry , but we shouldn &apos;t feel bad ...
about wanting a little time for ourselves .
sweetie , this isn &apos;t a honeymoon .
we have kids . you have got to let this go .
from now on , i am not losing sight of them for two seconds .
nothing gets past me .
did you find jay ?
i &apos;m getting worried .
i &apos;m sorry . i have to deal with haley .
no . you know what , sweetie ? i will deal with haley .
you go see if you can find dad .
i &apos;ll look for him out there .
lily , where are you going , huh ?
oh , my god .
i &apos;m so sorry .
oh , my god .
wow . what were you thinking ?
one of the kids had an i.d. , and she bought some drinks .
i tried one , and then another one .
it was stupid .
yes . yes , it was stupid ,
but you are really lucky
that this did not end as badly as it could have .
this is why we always say to you ...
when you drink , you make bad decisions .
i know , i know . i just-
one minute you &apos;re having wine coolers at homecoming ,
and the next ...
the game of truth or claire sweeps your high school .
thanks for not yelling at me .
oh , honey . that would just be cruel .
i &apos;ii wait till you feel better to yell .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll ever feel better .
does this happen every time you drink ?
yes .
yes , it does .
jay ?
over here .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m stuck . i laid down , my back went out .
oh . well , don &apos;t you worry . we &apos;re gonna get you out of here .
grab on .
yeah , you know , phil , this might not be the best-
no , no , no , no , no .
i &apos;m just gonna rock you- like a hurricane .
i &apos;m kidding . you &apos;re too old to get that . here we go .
wait . why don &apos;t you just get someone who works here ?
no , this is gonna work .
and now- oh , wow !
there &apos;s spasming .
don &apos;t move .
no . i don &apos;t wanna get-
by the way , i just want to thank you for this trip .
it &apos;s really been a vacation of a lifetime .
nothing weird !
aloha .
i keep my wallet in my front pocket , so that &apos;s-
that &apos;s what that is .
neck ... going .
i &apos;m sorry .
anyone ! anyone , help !
alert security !
seal off the island !
this- this way ! this way !
lily !
aha . you looking for someone ?
lily . we were so worried . we just got distracted .
oh , we &apos;re idiots .
ay ! don &apos;t beat yourself up .
i used to lose manny all the time .
now i lost your father . these things happen .
she &apos;s right , you know .
did she say my father &apos;s missing ?
we say we &apos;ll make time , but life gets in the way .
i mean , i know we &apos;re parents ,
but can &apos;t we be lovers too ?
this may be my worst birthday ever .
there you are !
oh , hi , honey .
he was stuck in a hammock . it was actually really funny .
i was on top of him for , like , 20 minutes .
you need to go now .
good night . honey .
my back seized up .
yeah , because you overdid it
after that phone call about your father .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m as old as he was .
wait . sit down here .
you &apos;d have liked him- my old man .
i &apos;m sure .
and he &apos;d have loved you .
my god , that guy- he was a charmer .
mmm , i know the type .
and we had a lot of fun .
but i &apos;ll tell you something .
our family vacations were nothing like this here .
one week a year in a rented cottage on lake erie ,
spiders this big .
i just wish he could have seen how things turned out .
well , if you keep going like this ,
maybe you can tell him yourself .
or i can tell him , because you &apos;re about to kill me , jay .
my legs , my arms , my back- everything is sore .
so i wore you out , huh ?
oh , no , no , no . don &apos;t get cocky , old man .
when i sit down , i can still get up . eh .
hey , uh- okay , come on .
come here . come here .
the rest of the trip went better .
haley &apos;s room stopped spinning .
yes , it is .
and a monkey-
there she is !
oh , honey ! hey !
do you want some eggs benedict ? so creamy !
no .
no ?
jay got back to the vacation he always wanted .
and mitch and cam managed to do some sightseeing ...
at a working banana plantation-
lily !
where they promptly lost lily again .
why did you dress her in jungle prints ?
because i thought it would be cute !
she &apos;s gonna think she &apos;s back in vietnam !
lily ! lily , honey !
me and claire , we-
we had a great time .
but we never did get that honeymoon .
i think i just expected a little too much from this vacation .
you were so sweet to try .
it was dumb .
like you said , the thrill is gone .
i never said that .
no , it &apos;s over .
but wait . put a few seconds back on the clock .
the kid still has a few moves .
oh , my god .
i figured out why we couldn &apos;t have a honeymoon .
because we never had a wedding .
oh , my god .
i still can &apos;t tell if you think this is lame or cool .
honey , it &apos;s incredibly cool .
looks like i finally get to walk you down the aisle .
daddy !
ow ! you better walk me .
okay . i &apos;ll do that .
we &apos;re here today to celebrate the renewing of the marriage vows ...
of phil and claire .
on this day they &apos;ve chosen to reaffirm their love for each other .
you may kiss your bride . oh !
i present to you , still as husband and wife ,
mr. and mrs. dunphy .
welcome to the nonstop flight from maui to los angeles .
thank for you choosing continental airlines .
thank you .
you know , honey ,
if anything were ever to happen to me ,
i would want you to get remarried .
okay .
that was a little fast .
oh , no . i just want to make you happy .
okay .
any idea of who you would remarry ?
vicky conroy probably .
she works in my office .
she &apos;s very organized . the kids love her .
are you guys talking about vicky ?
yeah .
mom , she &apos;s awesome .
just so you know , if something were to happen to me , i-
something &apos;s gonna happen to you , all right .
