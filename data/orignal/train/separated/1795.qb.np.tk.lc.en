remember when you were a kid , and your biggest worry was ,
like , if you &apos;d get a bike for your birthday
or if you &apos;d get to eat cookies for breakfast ?
being an adult , totally overrated .
i mean , seriously , don &apos;t be fooled
by all the hot shoes and the great sex
and the no parents anywhere telling you what to do .
adulthood is responsibility .
the lawyer has been managing her estate
with a limited power of attorney
but your mother &apos;s alzheimer &apos;s is advancing .
so while she &apos;s still lucid enough
to consent ,
she needs to sign everything over to you .
me ?
responsibility , it really does suck .
look , i haven &apos;t slept in 48 hours .
i &apos;m getting my first shot at heart surgery this morning .
i &apos;m missing rounds .
are you sure there isn &apos;t anybody here , or the attorney ?
i mean ,
do i really have to be the one to handle this ?
we &apos;re talking about her estate , finances , medical care .
you want to leave her life in someone else &apos;s hands ?
she &apos;s your mother .
really , really sucks .
adults have to be places and do things
and earn a living and pay the rent .
and if you &apos;re training to be a surgeon ,
holding a human heart in your hands ...
hello !
talk about responsibility !
what was that , dr.grey ?
sorry , it slipped.my hands ...
it &apos;s ok . i &apos;m done .
you can release mrs.patterson &apos;s heart now ,
very gently .
all right . let &apos;s warm her up . get her off bypass .
kind of makes bikes and cookies look
really , really good , doesn &apos;t it .
i wish i could hold a heart .
a monkey could hold a heart .
you &apos;re mad burke didn &apos;t ask you .
george , i need more ice and chips .
who did you invite ?
we said the list was jocks only
surgery , trauma , plastics .
who else ?
who else ?
some people from peds .
you invited the preschoolers to meredith &apos;s house .
next thing , you &apos;ll say that you invited the shrinks .
she invited mental defects . this party is doa .
meredith thinks this is going to be a small ,
meet @-@ your @-@ boyfriend cocktail thing .
did you clear this with her ?
no , but i will .
i promise .
why are you wasting the only weekend
your boyfriend is in town on a big party ?
is he bad in bed ?
no . i just want him to meet some of my friends .
right . sixty geeks in scrubs are your friends .
bad sex , sucks for you .
i heard there &apos;s a party tonight .
really ? a party ?
uh , news to me .
no party .
we losing her or what ?
are the grafts ?
they &apos;re open . temperature ?
she &apos;s at 96 and rising .
she should be doing this on her own .
that &apos;s her falling .
continue the progressions .
come on , mrs.patterson. paddles .
sets are below 90 .
charge .
ten joules .
clear .
come on , mrs.patterson.
give me 20 .
charge .
there . we have rhythm .
reluctant heart .
all right .
let &apos;s close . keep an eye on her .
good work , everyone .
the scariest part about responsibility ?
when you screw up and let it slip right through your fingers .
hey , i heard you
did a cabg with burke .
did you get to hold the heart ?
yeah .
it &apos;s an amazing feeling.you never forget the first time .
it was pretty great just to watch .
vicarious thrills , you know ?
yeah .
see you later .
bye .
i think maybe i did something to the heart
when i was holding it .
i nodded off a little , squeezed it .
oh , please . the heart &apos;s a tough muscle .
it can take a squeeze or two .
my fingernail popped a glove , cut straight through .
george , what if i punctured
mrs.patterson &apos;s heart ?
if you had punctured it ,
you would have known when they reperfused .
they got her heart beating . the woman &apos;s ok .
so i shouldn &apos;t tell burke ?
tell him what ?
you know , um ...
... nothing happened . the woman &apos;s ok , right ?
she &apos;s ok .
she &apos;s fine .
she &apos;s fine .
责任
what do you see , george ?
hyperinflated lungs , cloudy with bullae .
seriously diminished capacity .
she must be having trouble breathing .
course of action ?
bullectomy procedure . remove the bullae . reduce pressure .
it says here we operated on her back in &apos; 99 .
so mrs.drake has been through this before ,
but talk her through it anyway .
and resist the anti @-@ smoking lectures .
she feels bad enough already .
so , do you think , if they put a picture of these
in a pack of cigarettes , people would stop smoking ?
how long has your back been hurting you ?
it &apos;s chronic . means i have it all the time .
i know what &quot; chronic &quot; means .
what pain are you having ?
oh , man , the pain &apos;s bad .
it &apos;s like a thousand samurai warriors
stabbing their swords into my spine .
i &apos;m allergic to aspirin ,
most nsaids .
so maybe we &apos;ll start you on morphine .
no . the only things that will work are demerol
or dilaudid .
a ton of dilaudid will set me straight .
the standard starting dose is two .
did you see that tom cruise samurai movie , hmm ?
pow ! pow ! pow !
exaggerated and overly specific description of his pain .
a self @-@ prescription . &quot; pow ! pow ! pow ! &quot; ?
he &apos;s a dilaudid junkie .
so what do you do ?
check the database for history ,
refer to a program and discharge .
after you give him something .
that &apos;s exactly what he wants .
junkie or not , you still have to treat his pain
as if it were real .
why ?
the first rule in pain management -
always err on the side of caution .
he &apos;s in our care . he says he &apos;s in pain .
start a central line . his veins are shot .
the surgery before was supposed to help .
but it never felt right .
probably would have been a good idea to quit smoking .
i did ! four @-@ pack @-@ a @-@ day habit . tt was hell .
here you go , mrs.drake.
didn &apos;t do any good .
really ? because it looked ...
i mean , from the damage ,
we all thought you probably were still smoking .
cold turkey , five years ago , what did i get from my trouble ?
i still had to quit my job at the restaurant .
but even sitting , it hurt .
here you go .
nobody believed me . they all said it was in my head .
i &apos;ve seen the films . it &apos;s not all in your head .
you &apos;re right about that .
hey , come here .
you &apos;re too damn young to be a doctor .
hey .
what ?
i &apos;m older than i look .
do you think this is going to work this time ?
i think it &apos;s your best option .
straight shooter , huh ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
i like that .
hi , mr.patterson.
hi .
hemodynamics stable ?
yeah , map has stayed around 80 . cardiac output at five .
that &apos;s good , dr.grey ?
that &apos;s fine , mr.patterson.
but it &apos;s not good .
well , heart surgery takes a lot out of the patient ,
but we &apos;re monitoring your wife very carefully ,
and she should be fine .
mr.sterman , let &apos;s see about getting you out of here today .
how are you feeling ?
pretty ok , except i don &apos;t think i ever want
to have a bowel obstruction again .
really ?
we get people in here all the time requesting them .
so , you keeping down clear fluids ?
and my all timer favorite question to ask a patient
have you pooped yet ?
i &apos;m not exactly sure .
i think you &apos;d probably know .
passed gas ?
yes .
really ? because if i bring in my handy lie detector ...
ok , no .
and i shouldn &apos;t try and lie , i know .
i went to medical school .
you went to med school ?
yeah , dropped out my last year at clinical .
too many hours ,
and i was staring into the ice @-@ cold eyes of divorce .
yeah , i do research now ,
and i have a life , a family .
no offense .
no , no , that &apos;s ok .
i &apos;m just one of those people who believe you can have both .
maybe so .
but your first responsibility &apos;s always gonna be your patient
just coffee .
good .
ok .
ok .
we call this &quot; a spaghetti procedure . &quot;
we cut and deflate the bullae to facilitate
gentle manipulation of mrs. drake &apos;s lung .
dr. bailey , do you see that ?
sir ?
oh , my ever @-@ lovin &apos; ...
we need to open her up . i &apos;m taking out the scope .
you heard him , people . let &apos;s move .
lights .
let &apos;s get set up .
ten blade .
here you go .
retractors .
retractors .
scalpel ready .
towel .
rib spreader .
suction .
is that a towel ?
get a pan .
where did that come from ?
best guess , her surgery five years ago .
something careless this way comes .
a towel ?
not good .
she complained of pressure on her chest ,
but nobody takes that seriously
not good for the patient , not good for the hospital .
not good .
cristina , hit the files .
find out everything you can about that initial operation .
who was in that room ? who was responsible for closing ?
george , stay with the patient .
keep her happy . she seems to like you ?
right , ok , um , how long do you think ..
just , technically i am off at 6 .
am i invited ?
excuse me ?
am i invited to the party ?
well , yeah. yes , yeah , of course .
what was i supposed to say ?
ok , yeah , great . all right , 14 cases .
what kind ? i don &apos;t know . maybe an assortment .
microbrews , locals .
make sure they throw in some bar nuts .
i &apos;m ordering office supplies .
oh , yeah , sure .
microbrews , local . and throw in some bar nuts .
7 o &apos;clock , better at 5 .
hey , any luck ?
hey , if i do , will you invite me to the party ?
yeah , great . ok , thanks .
take it easy .
hey , mr. frost .
where have you been ? !
we &apos;re going to take care of you , all right ? just hang on
when i tell you to start a central line ,
you start a central line , no judgment ,
no question .
the guy &apos;s been in 7 hospitals
in the past four months . he is an addict .
the patient has a three @-@ lumbar fusion .
he &apos;s a junkie . we shouldn &apos;t be giving him ...
yeah , he &apos;s an addict , but his pain is real .
lose the attitude , get down there ,
start a central line .
told me i had a towel inside me .
who told you that ?
a surgeon , an older man .
handsome .
that &apos;s dr. webber .
he &apos;s our chief .
yeah .
it was a towel that somebody left the last time .
yes , ma &apos;am .
who would do that ?
that doesn &apos;t seem right , does it ?
no , ma &apos;am , no . it doesn &apos;t .
i was walking around with a towel inside of me .
how could that happen ?
so ? what happens now ?
now you keep this to yourself while we work it out .
do this for me .
you ok ?
yeah , yeah , i &apos;m good .
are you sure ? because you seem not ok .
i &apos;m fine . cabg was long .
well , let me take you out to dinner tonight .
you can tell me all about it .
real food , waiters ,
big chunks of carbs in a basket .
i can &apos;t .
forget about the party .
you know about the party ?
you friends can be at the party .
you and i can be alone somewhere else
how do you know about the party ?
thanks for not inviting me by the way . that felt good .
dinner , think about dinner. perfect opportunity .
what happened
started having swelling over her sternum ,
then blood just started crashing
dr. burke is on his way .
is she dying ?
somebody get him out of here .
keep applying pressure .
tyler , call for an or .
what happened ? she got her protamine ?
per protocol .
no allergic , anaphylactic or histamine responses .
her last counts ?
bt , ptt , inr , platelet counts were all stable .
even her hnh were stable .
what the hell went wrong ? let &apos;s move .
hold on .
i popped a glove .
what ?
in surgery , when i was holding it ,
i popped a glove with with my finger nail .
i think i may have nicked her heart .
let &apos;s go , people .
what were you thinking about ?
you had every opportunity to speak up
before i closed her chest , every opportunity
suction .
i &apos;m sorry .
and then you confess in front of her husband ?
you don &apos;t even know if you
were the cause . you have no idea .
i &apos;m sorry .
sponge .
over here .
there . look at the wall rupture .
it &apos;s a hell of a lot more than a fingernail .
her ventricular walls are weak .
i just had a conversation with mr. patterson .
i want a copy of his wife &apos;s chart
in my office by 5
tomorrow morning , the two of you meet with me and legal ,
and you better damn well be able
to explain what happened here
people &apos;re poking holes in hearts and leaving towels .
you &apos;re gonna go back and talk to the husband .
review the history .
apologize profusely .
your ass is on the line here , dr. grey .
you got called before the chief ?
tomorrow morning .
i could get kicked out of the program .
i could , right ?
you &apos;re not getting kicked out .
patterson &apos;s just gonna sue .
patterson is not going to sue .
you &apos;re not getting kicked out
what were you thinking ? telling burke ?
i told her not to .
i got to take this .
thanks . thank you . very comforting .
i &apos;ll watch your books .
so the beer is coming at 7 .
and some of the floor nurses are bringing wine .
you invited nurses ?
did you clear this with meredith ?
a few more people isn &apos;t gonna make a difference .
a party is a party .
and the bigger the party , the less time for bad sex with hockey player .
would you stop saying that .
ok .
hank and i have great sex , all the time .
we &apos;ll probably have sex after a party
or during a party
as long as you clear it with meredith .
hank just needs to realize that doctors can have fun .
we &apos;re not all workaholics with god complexes .
we are workaholics with god complexes .
the notary will be there at 6 : 30 too ?
and the home &apos;s physician will be there
to attest her mental competency
ok .
is there anything else i need to bring beside my license ?
my checkbook .
6 : 30 . i &apos;ll be there .
i heard .
it &apos;s a notary thing , a thing to get notarized .
i &apos;m talking about the heart thing .
do you want to talk about it ?
we &apos;re adults .
when did that happen ?
and how do we make it stop ?
dr. yang .
dr. burke .
that bypass graft got a little complicated .
it &apos;s nothing i couldn &apos;t handle .
good .
listen , i &apos;ll call you back .
that was my lawyer . he &apos;s advising me not to talk to you .
mr. patterson , i know that you &apos;re frustrated and angry ,
but i need ... we need some more information about your wife .
the walls of her heart are abnormally thin .
hey , don &apos;t blame this on my wife .
i heard from your very mouth what happened . i know .
but we can &apos;t treat her .
no , she was in the best shape of her life .
you ask her cardiologist .
she had lost 100 pounds .
don &apos;t you dare try to hang this on her .
mr. patterson , please .
we &apos;re through talking .
you don &apos;t like me very much , do you ?
oh , jerry , it &apos;s not you specifically . it &apos;s just ...
it &apos;s just people like you , that &apos;s all .
doc , i &apos;m feeling pretty good .
pain &apos;s about a three .
a three ? that &apos;s excellent .
mr. frost , i &apos;m glad we could help you out ,
as well as county , mercy west , seattle pres .
a lot of people have helped you out lately , jerry .
we &apos;re pleased we could do our part .
who &apos;s on discharge today , dr. karev ?
izzie stevens .
dr. stevens is gonna discharge you .
whoa , you can &apos;t discharge me . i &apos;m in pain .
you were in pain . now you &apos;re not .
dr. karev is going to recommend
some wonderful treatment programs for you .

he just did , my friend .
ok , any luck yet ?
nada .
ugh. looks like you &apos;re gonna have to spend another night .
i hate to miss the party .

you are the last person on my list ,
so it looks pretty good
so , doctors have lives after all. who &apos;d have thunk ?
dr. stevens
discharge my guy in 342 .
don &apos;t look at me like that .
it &apos;s not gonna take very long .
it &apos;s not .
you page me ?
i &apos;m gonna be a while .
do you think you could get home to sign for the beer ?
why don &apos;t you have your boyfriend sign for it ?
you have a very annoying way of sneaking up on people .
maybe if you were a little less creepy ...
i wouldn &apos;t come . i hate big parties .
is meredith the only person in the hospital
who doesn &apos;t know the size of the thing ?
i &apos;m telling her .
you can &apos;t . she &apos;s gone already .
what , already ?
i think she had ... um , excuse me ...
... an errand to run .
you don &apos;t think meredith &apos;s going to mind , right ?
i want you to make it very clear to her
that i had nothing to do with this party ...
nothing .
oh , i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late . it was the traffic .
it doesn &apos;t matter , dear .
don &apos;t tell me the notary didn &apos;t show .
oh , everybody &apos;s here. it &apos;s just your mother isn &apos;t .
mom ?
mom ?
what do you people want from me ?
we need you to sign the lawyer &apos;s papers .
i have a cranial reconstruction in a half an hour
i need to go
ok , mom. we &apos;re all here . we have a notary .
i need you to focus , and i need you to sign these papers .
mom , look at me .
it &apos;s an emergency surgery . i don &apos;t have time for this .
she can &apos;t sign anything now .
we should have done this earlier in the day .
i couldn &apos;t come earlier in the day .
i have a job and a life , and i &apos;m here now .
you &apos;re gonna have to come back tomorrow , when she &apos;s lucid .
you know , why did she put this off for so long ?
and why did you let her ?
doesn &apos;t it strike you as irresponsible ?
i mean , what the hell is wrong with you people ? !
izzie , i &apos;m gonna kill you .
you could touch that , but i &apos;d have to kill you .
so , about that towel thing ?
it &apos;s been taken care of .
ok .
you don &apos;t need to concern yourself with it .
so , what &apos;s gonna happen ?
we &apos;re not gonna talk about it anymore is what &apos;s gonna happen , we clear ?
or you had too much alcohol to understand me ?
we &apos;re very clear .
good .
you have any bourbon ?
you can &apos;t discharge a man in pain .
ow ! you &apos;re hurting me !
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s making it difficult . stop resisting .
just give me the hit of demerol .
the dilaudid hasn &apos;t worn off yet .
look , i &apos;m not leaving .
i &apos;m calling psych .
no , no .
don &apos;t call psych .
wait , wait , wait .
stop , jerry . stop . stop .
jerry . jerry !
concussion ?
he &apos;s blown his left pupil . page shepherd .
we get him done the ct .
that was one hard fall .
what do you see ?
subdural bleed .
with midline shift .
we have to evacuate this now .
anywhere else you have to be , dr. stevens ,
or are you in ?
brain surgery ?
mm @-@ hmm .
are you kidding me ?
that &apos;s what i thought .
here you go .
where is izzie ? !
she didn &apos;t clear it with you ?
this was supposed to be
a meet @-@ the @-@ boyfriend get @-@ together little thing !
izzie has a lot of friends .
izzie doesn &apos;t know this many people .
i told her to clear it with you .
i can &apos;t handle this .
you want me to kick everyone out ?
i &apos;m going to kick everyone out .
baby , you made it ! whoo !
screw it . hold this .
and give me this .
i made it !
george ! george , come here . come on .
see it ?
it &apos;s hard to miss .
little more than he bargained for .
maybe he &apos;s lucky .
maybe this is his way out of the hole .
the hole ? interesting expression .
my father was into smack pretty heavy .
he was a musician .
it &apos;s tolerated in his line of work .
not good for the family at home .
why do we want to be surgeons , anyway ?
surgery is a very serious business .
full house .
royal flush .
get naked , baby boy .
surgery is stupid .
you &apos;re so sexy !
it &apos;s stupid .
it &apos;s stupid .
give me that . you &apos;re drunk .
i &apos;m not driving . i &apos;m not on @-@ call .
i &apos;m in my own house . my life is crap .
and it &apos;s my party , and i &apos;ll get drunk if i want to .
is , um , izzie stevens ?
oh , you must be hank .
he &apos;s very large and hockey @-@ like .
no , izzie &apos;s not here right now .
you and izzie will give birth to very tall , blonde people ...
kind of like barbies .
izzie said she was gonna be at home .
she didn &apos;t say there &apos;s gonna be a party
which pisses both of us off .
would you like some tequila ? it helps
when do you think she &apos;s gonna get here ?
don &apos;t know . but , we &apos;re low on ice , hank .
i &apos;m serious .
so am i.
we &apos;re interns , hank .
the hospital owns us . it &apos;s what we do .
bye .
nice to meet you .
can you guys see him through recovery ?
yeah , i &apos;ll take it .
no , i can do it .
that &apos;s ok , stevens .
he &apos;s my patient now too .
no , i got it . see your hockey player .
i &apos;m serious .
yeah , ok .
i guess . thanks , alex .
no problem .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t have a chance to call .
my patient needed brain surgery .
like , we were inside his brain . how cool is that ?
oh , my god .
there &apos;s a party at your house .
yeah , did you get a chance to hang out ?
i wanted you to meet some of the people i work with .
i don &apos;t care about the people you work with .
i just want to see you .
you didn &apos;t mind meeting the people i worked with
when they were models ,
yeah , well , when they were models ,
you actually showed up to your own parties .
yeah .
this is my life now , hank .
i work 100 @-@ hour weeks .
i can &apos;t always show up to my own parties on time .
my patients have to come first . i ...
yeah , i just flew across the entire country ,
and there &apos;s 100 people at your house .
100 people who understand what i do all day .
i shouldn &apos;t have to apologize for that .
no , you shouldn &apos;t .
look , let &apos;s just go by the party for a little while .
you &apos;ll really like everyone once
you get a chance to know them
i should just go .
hank , come on .
i &apos;ll call you .
you know , in some states , you get arrested for that .
so , you blew me off for a bottle of tequila .
tequila &apos;s no good for you . doesn &apos;t call , doesn &apos;t write .
it &apos;s not nearly as much fun to wake up to .
take me for a ride , derek .
you know , it sounds like the party &apos;s winding down .
listen to me !
what ?
we should probably sneak inside now .
we &apos;ve done enough sneaking for the night .
it was good sneaking , but enough sneaking .
yeah , i &apos;d say we &apos;re pretty good sneakers .
you mind moving this tail wagon ?
you &apos;re blocking me in .
apparently not good enough .
when &apos;s your meeting with the chief ?
in an hour .
holy mother of destruction .
you missed doctor @-@ palooza .
apparently , you didn &apos;t .
i should probably never speak to you again .
i &apos;m so sorry , meredith .
i had no idea it was going to get so ...
it &apos;s ok .
really , i don &apos;t care .
what would i be doing , anyway ?
preparing for your career @-@ altering meeting .
sorry .
that heart wall shouldn &apos;t have torn .
anything in the patient &apos;s history ?
husband said she was in the best shape of her life .
she lost 100 pounds last year .
100 pounds in a year ... how &apos;s her muscle mass ?
do you even know whose that was ?
i &apos;m hoping it was yours .
no .
what do you think ?
50 says meredith gets tossed out on her ass
and burke walks away clean .
please be nice to her .
so , i have done a lot of research on this ,
and dr.burke has been kind enough to help me .
and i understand my responsibility
in what i &apos;ve done wrong here .
however , i do think the patient &apos;s history
is significant in this case .
she still weighs 200 pounds ,
which is why no one even noticed it .
but with that kind of a weight drop ,
it doesn &apos;t matter how much you weigh .
technically , you &apos;re anorexic .
along with all that fat , she was losing heart muscle .
that certainly could be the reason
for a small poke to become a large tear .
that still doesn &apos;t change the fact , though .
the poke wasn &apos;t reported by dr.grey
at the time of the occurrence .
and if i could change that ...
and you can &apos;t .
you left yourself and the hospital
open to tremendous amount of liability .
not if the weight loss caused the problem .
i &apos;m sorry i have no choice here ...
i &apos;ve spoken to the husband .
and i believe as long as his wife remains stable ...
i can &apos;t take your beliefs to the bank ,
dr.burke.
dr.grey made a huge error here .
and she reported it .
too late .
and in front of the patient &apos;s husband .
but she reported it . she spoke up .
five years ago , as a ct fellow ,
i had a nagging feeling that i didn &apos;t check the body cavity
of a lung patient closely enough before i closed .
the patient seemed fine post @-@ op ,
and i was in a hurry .
and yesterday you and dr.bailey pulled a towel out
from under that patient &apos;s lung .
why didn &apos;t i report it at an appropriate time ?
maybe because i was afraid
that i would be called into a meeting
where some hospital lawyer &apos;s
fear of liability could in my career
even great doctors make mistakes ,
and when we do ,
we &apos;ve got to have a chance to speak up
without fear of retribution .
or everyone suffers .
dr.grey spoke up .
responsibility . it really does suck .
meredith . you ok ?
yeah , one @-@ month probation .
that &apos;s good .
yep .
burke saved my ass in there .
don &apos;t you all have something better to do
come on people move
he was always gonna tell them about the towel .
just wanted to wait for the right time .
information is power .
unfortunately
once you get past the age of braces and training bras ,
responsibility doesn &apos;t go away .
jerry , this is sloane .
she &apos;s here to talk to you ,
if you want about options for rehab
it can &apos;t be avoided .
mrs.drake ,
i cannot begin to tell you how truly sorry i am .
either someone makes us face it ,
or we suffer the consequences .
izzie ! i did it ! i pooped !
all right !
missed your party ?
life as a surgeon .
and loving every minute of it .
and still , adulthood has its perks .
thanks for the coffee .
i mean , the shoes , the sex ,
the no parents anywhere telling you what to do ...
that &apos;s pretty damn good .
