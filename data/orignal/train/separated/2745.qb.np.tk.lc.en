the uv index is 10 .
jesus , we don &apos;t do anything . we don &apos;t eat .
we don &apos;t go out . god knows we don &apos;t do anything else .
is that all you ever think about , sex ?
all i ever think about ? you haven &apos;t fucked me in over a year .
blood sugar , i told you , the weight loss .
good , fine . skin cancer .
what &apos;s up ?
thing we talked about at the wedding .
rusty .
you made the call to ltaly .
our friend over there &apos;s gonna fit him for a suit .
she &apos;s sending over two of her best tailors .
so i should meet &apos; em at the airport ?
no , they &apos;re gonna call you when they arrive .
now you hook &apos; em up with a third party , huh ?
get &apos; em some scissors .
this is smart , ton &apos; , the more i think about it .
glad you approve .
anybody taking a look , there &apos;s nothing linking us to it .
hey , good seeing you .
hey , there he is .
how you doing ?
what &apos;s up ?
how are you ?
listen , come here a minute .
about the other day ...
i &apos;m fine . a couple of stitches .
yeah ? my fucking temper , you know ?
no no no no , it &apos;s okay , really .
take it .
thanks .
look , ton &apos; ,
i don &apos;t remember slamming the refrigerator door ,
but carlo told me and my dad ,
i never should have raised my hands to you . i &apos;m sorry .
as long as you realize .
huh ?
it basically became the same thing every day .
coffee , couple lines of meth ,
smooth that out with a shot of jameson .
and that was just to drive the kids to school .
then one day i fell asleep at work and forgot
about gracie &apos;s recital .
human frailty , it makes me sick sometimes .
chris , right ?
should i know you ?
kevin mucci , yonkers .
we met at the trotters . sal lacuzzo &apos;s cousin .
right . hey .
hey .
yonkers , what are you , lost ?
my ex &apos;s birthday over at the red robin in clifton .
i figured i &apos;d need a meeting to make it through that shit .
i hear that .
so i saw my cousin this week .
it turns out he ran into a friend of yours , the big guy , vito .
and ...
he was in a fag bar , dancing with a guy .
get the fuck out !
right , joey , use your head .
you are not gonna fucking believe this .
vito spatafore &apos;s an ass @-@ muncher .
oh ! what ?
what did you just say ?
i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s true .
we ran into this kid .
vito was spotted in a fag bar in new york .
by who ?
the kid &apos;s cousin . allegedly .
probably bullshit .
he &apos;s a married man . - with a goomar .
all right , back up a second .
what did the kid say exactly ?
the kid &apos;s cousin sal lacuzzo--
from yonkers , i know him .
sal was at this place in the city , supposedly on business .
he saw vito holding hands with a guy in nipple rings .
you &apos;re leaving out the best part .
he was wearing a motorcycle outfit ,
iike the guy in the village people with the leather hat
and the vest .
chaps too .
i don &apos;t know . fucking slander , ask me .
all right , let &apos;s take this in the back .
yeah , that &apos;s what vito did .
you can go .
tell you one thing , if it was me this kid was spreading rumors about ,
he &apos;d have something up his own ass .
and it wouldn &apos;t be no cock , either .
that &apos;s the point , though .
this guy sal , i know him .
he &apos;s a friend of ours .
i fucking called it , long time ago .
you knew vito was a recchion &apos; ?
yes .
when ?
i never said it , but i knew .
get the fuck out . enough of this rush to judgment .
for all we know , this fucking sal guy &apos;s got a hard @-@ on for vito .
oh , you think this is funny , huh ?
there &apos;s a man &apos;s reputation at stake here .
a married man , with kids .
nah , that don &apos;t mean shit . elton john was married .
yeah , rock hudson too . i think .
so what do we gotta do , ton &apos; , actually see him take it in the ass ?
get vito on the phone .
you know , he called me the other night .
3 : 00 in the morning , after the wedding .
and ?
honestly , it was weird . he wanted to know what was going on .
he was fucking fishing , see if we heard .
straight to voice mail .
ton &apos; , i mean , he represents us .
i &apos;m not gonna condemn the man off the word of some fucking douchebag from yonkers
i could care less , basically .
yeah ? maybe you &apos;re a flambe .
fucking nauseating .
it was up to me , i &apos;d drag vito behind my fucking car right now .
will you take it easy over there , fucking judge roy bean ?
one of my bar girls knows his goomar .
we &apos;ll check with her . maybe she &apos;s seen him and knows where he is .
loren .
think about it , though , ton &apos; --
sudden weight loss .
alds ?
nobody &apos;s got alds .
i don &apos;t wanna hear that word in here again !
the federal prosecutor &apos;s office won &apos;t tell you why your son &apos;s being held ?
or where . it has been four days now since he &apos;s been arrested ,
and we have no money to hire a lawyer .
how did you hear about the law center ?
you will write the ...
habeas corpus ? i &apos;m not an attorney yet .
i &apos;m a volunteer assistant . one of our attorneys will file the writ .
he is a good boy .
the fbl went to his school
and took him like a criminal . this is america ?
it &apos;s not easy to be muslim now .
they wouldn &apos;t let afaf skate at the local rink
unless she removed her headscarf .
you &apos;re kidding me , why ?
they said it was for insurance .
it might fall off and someone could trip .
if she had been wearing a yarmulke , it would have been a different story .
you can bet .
they &apos;re these poor , hardworking people .
finn , you &apos;re not eating ?
coffee &apos;s good .
the government is just completely fucking this family over .
when did it start she could use that kind of language
in this house with immunity ?
i &apos;m telling mom about these people that came in yesterday .
let me guess , was it a crack whore trying to get her kids back
for the welfare money ?
actually , it was a family from afghanistan who fled the taliban
and sweated out visa lotteries
in a refugee camp , and hold down three jobs .
you think it &apos;s funny ? the fbl snatched their son off the street
iike we &apos;re some third @-@ world dictatorship .
pretty scary .
there must have been some reason , meadow .
like he &apos;s a terrorist , maybe .
9 @-@ 1.1 , 9 @-@ 1.1 .
bush is using it as an excuse to erode our constitutional protections ,
and you &apos;re falling for it .
well , i voted for him .
right , well , you don &apos;t relate to black people clinging to logs .
you oughta chill out about some of this .
hey .
let me ask you something ,
those two arabs
with the credit cards , fazool and whatever his name is--
yeah ?
you think there &apos;s a chance they could be ...
i don &apos;t know , al @-@ qaedas , something like that ?
hmm .
you know at one point it did cross my mind .
yeah , and ?
i don &apos;t think so .
they &apos;re gun nuts but the smaller guy ahmed ,
when those danish cartoons got published ,
he was very upset , but at the protestors .
he said he hated the cartoons
but that the rioting shit would just bring bad attention to all muslims .
and the other guy mohammed , his brother &apos;s
a government interrogator in lebanon
or syria .
plus mohammed and his girlfriend have a dog ,
a springer spaniel .
i &apos;m gonna get a coffee .
vito , what the fuck you doing ?
tony &apos;s looking for you .
for me ?
he &apos;s been calling for fucking days .
my goddamn phone , jesus . everything all right ?
you tell us .
i &apos;m good . tell tony i &apos;ll call him .
it &apos;s better you come in .
sure .
you go ahead , and i &apos;ll follow you .
what ?
ho !
where the fuck ...
what are you doing ? !
motherfucker !
fucking finook .
lying piece of shit .
better not come around here no more .
hey .
you speak ltal , right ?
some friends coming over from naples ,
paying a visit to a guy from new york .
who ?
the little guy in ozone park .
that &apos;s pretty high up .
you should provide &apos; em a couple of dumb gats ,
guidance on where to find him .
how do i get ahold of them ?
just leave your phone on .
part two when it &apos;s done .
i hear fat vito &apos;s been riding up the hershey highway .
where &apos;d you get that ?
come on .
somebody started a joke . i won &apos;t mention any names .
there &apos;s no truth to it . - oh .
it &apos;s a fucking captain you &apos;re talking about .
people went to see him . he was down the shore with his goomar .
so it &apos;s bullshit then .
as soon as he saw &apos; em , took off like a bat out of hell .
fuck .
you didn &apos;t hear it from me .
it could be a mid @-@ life thing .
sucking a cock ?
mr. spatafore , hey .
marie &apos;s still at the hospital with her mom .
kids asleep ?
they went to sleep about an hour ago .
fuck !
hi . how are you doing ?
i need a room for the night .
i don &apos;t have anybody down for a reservation .

we accept that too .
but you can take care of it in the morning .

you don &apos;t know anything about this ?
you left it there to rot .
i don &apos;t believe this .
with my husband on his deathbed ...
oh , sarah bernhardt .
... you went over there and you picked through the place like a vulture !
you said you &apos;d straighten out the permits with the building department
and you never did .
that is beside the point !
carmela , what happened to my bundt pan ?
it was your fault the permits were denied in the first place .
you &apos;re a broken record , for god &apos;s sake . that &apos;s what you are .
carmela , wait .
no , let her go . i &apos;ve had a lifetime of her bullshit .

i gotta warn ya , they &apos;re addictive .

he said he &apos;d be back from vegas today . i don &apos;t know .
you and vito ,
how are things going with you guys ?
we have our ups and downs .
and in the romance department ?
excuse me ?
what &apos;s this all about ?
it &apos;s awkward .
no offense , i really don &apos;t want to talk about this .
vito &apos;s a good father and a loving husband .
but his mind is elsewhere .
he takes these unexplained powders .
he &apos;s got a goomar . i know all about it .
it &apos;s nothing . forget about it .
you hear from him ,
tell him i brought him some blood , sweat and tears tickets .
backstage passes too .
i &apos;m telling ya ,
my business , i &apos;m around a lot of women .
that one ain &apos;t getting laid .
hello .
vito ?
you got him ?
who ?
put vito on the phone , asshole .
fuck you , motherfucker .
what , are you sucking his dick ? put him on .
how about i kick your ass , you fucking faggot ?
yeah , that &apos;s right , telephone tough @-@ guy . put vito on the phone !
there ain &apos;t no vito , man . i found the phone on the side of the road .
what ?
hang on a second .
where &apos;d you find the phone ?
hello .
hello !
oh , you motherfucker .
what happened ?
bob at the marina where tony docks his boat
says he &apos;ll donate a sunset dinner cruise .
i paid $ 300 for that ?
yeah .
i got seasick in bermuda on one of those .
oh , angie , finally .
sorry .
i had these sales reps in my office .
we &apos;re just going over the list for the silent auction .
we &apos;re already up to about 7500 bucks .
oh good , artie .
ladies .
a silent auction again ?
why not get a live auctioneer ?
i got sea bream , beautiful .
porcini @-@ dusted ravioli , huh ?
i hate to be a pain , but i gotta get back .
can we just let him cook ?
sure .
great , go for it .
where were we ?
jesus christ . he &apos;s always interrupting .
people enjoy the silent auction .
i thought our goal was to raise money .
i say we get &apos; em liquored up , let &apos; em tear each other &apos;s throats out .
well ...
it &apos;s just an idea .
anyhow , put me down for $ 2,000 worth of bodywork and / or paint .
2,000 ? madonn &apos; , ange .
so , did you hear about vito and marie ? separated .
oh , sorry , i gotta take this .
hello ?
they were just at the wedding . they seemed fine .
what &apos;d i tell you ? is that a beautiful fish or what ?
oh , for god &apos;s sake , all right !
can i just get some prosciutto melon to go ?
i &apos;m sorry , guys . i gotta get back .
no , the quarter panel from the lesabre , i said .
oh shit .
you didn &apos;t know he was gay ?
actually i had him pegged the whole time , but ...
he a close friend ?
not only that , he &apos;s one of my most valuable guys .
he &apos;s ambitious , he &apos;s focused .
when i was in the hospital ,
he helped carmela tremendously when we were strapped .
you &apos;ve implied you have millions of dollars .
your hospital stay was actually that costly ?
well no , but , uh ...
huh ?
is that the issue ?
you tell me . what is the issue ?
he &apos;s a fa @-@ ag !
and ?
now what am l supposed to do ?
about what ?
i know what . they &apos;re born that way , right ?
it &apos;s not their fault .
frankly i think they go about in pity for themselves .
i don &apos;t think they see it as a fault .
in your circle i &apos;m sure you got all kinds
of gays and trans @-@ whatevers
of all stripes .
but not where i come from .
you personally--
how do you feel about homosexuality ?
i find it disgusting .
men kissing men , holding hands in the street .
every fuckin &apos; tv show now , they rub your nose on it .
although , that--
the lesbian thing with the , uh ...
jennifer beals ,
it &apos;s not bad .
she a dyke in real life ?
i don &apos;t give too much of a shit
what people do behind closed doors
with the consenting adults .
although don &apos;t forget : i &apos;m a strict catholic .
i agree with that senator sanitorium ,
who says if we let this stuff go too far ,
pretty soon we &apos;ll be fucking dogs .
i hear a lot of ambivalence .
this guy that got outed , look ,
the guys that work for me are asking for head .
his head . what the fuck ?
you know , him and me , we &apos;re in the construction business .
now some of these union old @-@ timers , the contractors ,
they &apos;re not gonna want to be seen with him .
and i &apos;m talking huge deals , major fucking dollars .
a lot of your circle must have done jail time .
they can &apos;t be strangers to male @-@ male sexual contact .
you get a pass for that .
well , that &apos;s nice .
well , what are you gonna do ?
there &apos;s no women there .
you &apos;re there five , 10 years .
just for the record , my incarceration was very short term ,
so i never had any need for any anal-- you know .
so this fellow who &apos;s been outed , what &apos;s he saying ?
you think i &apos;m lying , don &apos;t you ?
about when i was in jail .
i &apos;ve given you no indication i think you &apos;re lying .
what the fuck , i suppose something inside me says
god bless , a &apos; salut &apos; .
who gives a shit ?
i mean i had a second chance . why shouldn &apos;t he ?
part of your new outlook ?
maybe .
i salute it , then .
tall fuckin &apos; order , i &apos;ll tell you that .
how so ?
you can talk about every day being a gift and stopping to smell the roses ,
but regular life &apos;s got a way of picking away at it .
your house , the shit you own ,
it drags you down .
your kids , what they want .
one bad idea after another .
just trying to work a cell phone menu is enough to make you scream .
there &apos;s some cold pasta .
no , i ate already .
what &apos;s all that ?
for the silent auction .
my busy little beaver .
not really .
look , ton &apos; , i haven &apos;t wanted to bug you ,
but before you &apos;d gotten hurt ,
you said you would get that building inspector
to cut me some slack so i could get back to my business ?
oh yeah , right right . i will , later .
come here .
no , uh , i &apos;m still not ready for that .
last time i thought i tore something from tensing my muscles .
no , i got something for that scar .
oh .
vitamin e.
my facialist said it will help get the red out .
you were right about my uncle , carm .
all along .
it doesn &apos;t give me any pleasure , believe me .
i should have cut him out of my life .
i brought this all on myself .
you did not . don &apos;t ever think that .
all this , you never once said &quot; l told you so . &quot;
accentuate the positive .
i wanted you to get better .
you know my shrink ...
told me that , uh ...
i stood by junior through all his jealousy and shit ...
trying to prove i &apos;m a good guy ...
and that my mother couldn &apos;t hate a good boy like that .
imagine laying next to a guy 15 years
and all the time he &apos;s been playing for the pink team .
who told you ? tony swore me to secrecy .
i &apos;m not gonna burn my sources .
anyway , it &apos;s all over the place .
those children ... imagine when they find out their father &apos;s a finook .
god , she &apos;s such a bright girl , marie spatafore .
you think she and vito had some arrangement ?
i just hope she gets herself tested .
still , vito ? he &apos;d be like the last one you &apos;d suspect .
suspect of what ?
wow , such a young lady !
yes , she &apos;s working two jobs .
days she &apos;s interning at gendler ,
lookstein , abruzzo &amp; abruzzo .
what about vito ?
nothing . him and marie are having some problems , that &apos;s all .
i can probably guess .
excuse me ?
huh @-@ uh , i &apos;m not going first .
do you know something ?
okay ...
he is possibly ...
gay .
finn saw him giving some guy a blowjob .
what ?
when dad got him that job in construction ?
finn showed up early one morning and he saw vito
in a car going down on some security guard .
oh my god !
he saw this ?
he had finn all freaked out . he still does .
why didn &apos;t you say something ?
because vito warned finn not to .
you gotta hear what meadow just told us .
mom !
the cat &apos;s out of the bag , meadow .
oh , it &apos;s &quot; dr. yank &apos; em , &quot; the painless dentist .
how you doing , kid ? hey ton &apos; .
hey--
unfortunately , finn here has got some bad news ,
so , uh , listen up .
sit down .
go ahead .
tell &apos; em what you saw .
don &apos;t be scared . it &apos;s all right .
all right , if we can just head over and have lunch .
good morning .
good morning .
let me ask you a question .
before he cornered you in the porta @-@ potty ,
when the security guard was sucking him off--
whoa one sec , it was the other way around .
what ?
vito was blowing the security guard .
son of a bitch !
catchin &apos; , not pitchin &apos; ?
he &apos;s not gonna know i told you ?
you ain &apos;t gonna have no problem from vito , believe me .
what are you gonna do ?
lt &apos;ll be okay .
get him to pay for some therapy .
look , why don &apos;t you ... why don &apos;t you go out front ,
get yourself a sandwich ,
any kind you like , huh ?
soda .
when we &apos;re done here , somebody will take you back .
all right .
i wanna kill the fat faggot myself .
be a fuckin &apos; honor .
cut off his pisciatil &apos; and feed it to him .
there can be no mistake now .
i can &apos;t believe i stuck up for him !
i feel like i &apos;ve been stabbed in the heart .
we can &apos;t have him here in our social club no more .
i mean , that much i do know .
social club ?
he &apos;s gotta go !
i wanna think about it .
yeah , i don &apos;t know .
what the fuck ? what is there to think about ?
sit down .
fuck that ! i &apos;ll say it again !
what the fuck is there to think about ?
you gonna take care of his kids , huh , after he &apos;s gone ?
it &apos;s true . they didn &apos;t do nothing .
poor little guys .
now sit down .
i &apos;m sorry if i yelled , t. it &apos;s just ...
how much more betrayal can i take ?
vito , a fag .
big construction tycoon .
ton &apos; , when he was always talking about &quot; greasing the union , &quot;
who knew that &apos;s what he meant ?
all right , this stays in these four walls .
am i understood ?
phil , oh my god .
you poor kid .
i know . i can &apos;t believe it myself .
i keep waiting for him to call .
how long am i supposed to tell the kids he &apos;s away on business ?
that fuckin &apos; shitbag . i get my hands on him
i &apos;m gonna tear him limb from limb .
oh , phil , don &apos;t say that .
you &apos;re my cousin he married ,
making a mockery of the whole sacrament .
but what do we really know ?
i mean , maybe there were signs , but ...
vito spatafore is a good man ,
and he &apos;s a wonderful dad .
somebody sees something one time
and he &apos;s tossed aside like garbage ?
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here , honey .
there &apos;s been confirmation through the grapevine .
vito was seen in a car with a man .
i don &apos;t want to get graphic beyond that ,
the idea of it repulses me so much .
what confirmation ? who ?
the witness has no reason to lie .
no ...
we can &apos;t be in denial no more , much as we love him .
where do you think he might have gone , honey ?
so we can get him back here , get him to do something about it .
excuse me , angie here ?
in the office .
we can get you anything you want , sweetheart ,
air bags , chrome rims--
oh , hi .
carm , hi .
i &apos;m sorry . am i interrupting something ?
i &apos;m here for the free bodywork certificates for the auction .
oh , that &apos;s right .
but if you &apos;re busy ...
this &apos;ll just take another sec .
okay , sure .
they were doing something behind closed doors .
well you know angie &apos;s put money on the street .
how do you know ?
angie told me .
she didn &apos;t tell me .
probably &apos; cause of tony . aw ,
maybe he didn &apos;t want you to know something like that .
me and my big mouth .
she &apos;s got enough money to do that , huh ?
well , she &apos;s pretty successful with that body shop , so ...
our grandmothers did it .
those were harder times , but ... a &apos; salut &apos; , right ?
she &apos;s one of us . now it &apos;s like she &apos;s one of them .
you wanted to see me , ton &apos; ?
yeah .
hey , carlo .
good to see you .
sit down .
putting you in charge of all construction business ,
replacing vito .
holy shit !
guys respect you across the board ,
you done real good real with the ports ...
thank you , ton &apos; .
jeez , i don &apos;t know what to say .
we &apos;ll have a drink .
congratulations .
a &apos; salut , a &apos; salut .
listen , ton &apos; ...
since you think enough of me to give me this responsibility
i might as well be the one to say it .
all right , skip the preambles .
the guys on vito &apos;s crew ,
they say if he was to come back ,
they refuse to take orders from him .
oh , they do ?
not only that ,
a couple of the other captains won &apos;t talk to him ,
and i don &apos;t disagree .
paulie especially .
now that he &apos;s accepted it , hey ...
he &apos;s the most out for vito &apos;s scalp .
yeah , you should hear him , ton &apos; . he &apos;s goin &apos; fuckin &apos; mau @-@ mau on the subject .
it &apos;s not their fucking decision who they work with .
let me tell you something--
fuckin &apos; vito , through sheer hard work ,
turned himself into my best earner .
i don &apos;t even know if i &apos;d have the new boat without him .
he &apos;s a come @-@ from @-@ behind kind of guy .
that &apos;s true , but--
so i &apos;m gonna burn that kind of dedication ?
it &apos;s hard to believe i couldn &apos;t get something
more out of him , if he were to come back .
stocks , offshore shit , i don &apos;t know .
well ...
these other guys feel an effort should be made
to find him and put him down for the honor of the family .
oh , please , huh ?
you know , certain people , they love the high drama ,
iike fuckin &apos; high school girls . and others i could name ,
they just can &apos;t wait to whack somebody , anybody .
but some people feel it &apos;s against our principles , tony .
a sin .
carlo , let &apos;s be honest with ourselves here .
we all know vito &apos;s not the first .
well ...
we &apos;re gonna do great things .
aw , jesus , thanks again , anthony . thank you .
what ?
it &apos;s 2006 .
there &apos;s pillow biters in the special forces .
let me just ask you , ton &apos; --
sake of argument .
let &apos;s say he shows up .
you gonna kiss this guy on both cheeks ?
take paulie , okay ?
you know perfectly well
guys like him never kick up their full percent to you .
you look the other way ,
price of doing business .
but you cut vito slack now that he &apos;s &quot; out of the closet , &quot;
just the excuse people need to go off the reservation
and start withholding serious money .
let me read in peace , will you ?
having fun with all this paper ?
i can &apos;t believe this is just one case .
rafaella martino . i &apos;m the lead attorney on this mess .
oh . meadow soprano .
i &apos;m michael kardish . i work with rae . - hi .
ms. soprano came highly recommended .
columbia dean &apos;s list , volunteer at the south bronx law center ...
this is really interesting too .
of course it &apos;s different than the kind of thing we see at the law center .
clients there are so trampled and abused--
welcome to white @-@ collar fraud .
i need the e @-@ mails from box 44 and 45 , july and august .
pull them and leave them with my assistant .
okay .
tony soprano &apos;s kid .
tony .
building my lats back up .
did you by any chance talk to the building inspector about my house ?
shit , i forgot .
the sorting &apos;s tedious , but some of the cases--
this guy was pretty clever , really .
he set up all these phony investment firms
and then just siphoned the money out :
$ 80 million . - whoa .
yeah , he &apos;s out on bail .
then you look at my father &apos;s friend ,
federal marshals dragging him
out of his own daughter &apos;s wedding .
he hasn &apos;t even been tried yet .
you &apos;re innocent in this country until proven guilty .
yeah , but johnny macaroni was indicted for murder .
they couldn &apos;t let him stay 15 more minutes ?
you better put your pants on .
you know why they did that ?
to humiliate him in front of everyone .
metal detectors , frisking ,
my father with the shoes ?
it was pure harassment .
yeah , but the guy &apos;s lucky they even let him out .
oh , so white @-@ collar criminals can destroy people &apos;s lives
and steal their pensions and it &apos;s no big deal to you .
you know what ? bad subject .
let &apos;s talk about something else .
no , let &apos;s talk about it
so we can stop with the &quot; macaroni &quot; cracks .
weird , since you &apos;re part ltalian yourself .
please , my dad is so deracinated .
yeah , the way he prefers it . all those hysterical jokes
about ltalian cheeses and smelly feet .
why are you picking a fight ?
i &apos;m not , but you &apos;re slamming my family . i don &apos;t know .
this is good shit .
it &apos;s amazing .
you weren &apos;t there for the &quot; grand inquisition &quot; about vito .
i knew it . i &apos;m picking the fight .
i was in the back of a butcher shop
with your uncle paulie ,
ratting out a guy i don &apos;t really even know .
i mean what do you think &apos;s going to happen to vito for being gay ?
and don &apos;t give me any of that &quot; poverty of the mezzogiorno &quot; bullshit .
we &apos;re in fucking caldwell , new jersey ,
and you &apos;re on your high horse about justice ?
they are gonna mete it out themselves .
this is untenable .
this is nice , this pot .
yeah , that &apos;s a baneda-- arts and crafts movement .
yeah ? i really don &apos;t know much about this stuff .
well , you &apos;ve got a good eye .
that &apos;s the most expensive piece in the store .
