now i know you &apos;ve been working with margaux
and digging up dirt on me .
you know , as crazy as louise may be ,
i &apos;m not gonna help you do to her what you did to me .
i messed up .
this is over !
why ?
because i &apos;m pregnant .
my father was attacked twice .
the second attacker was found at the police station hanged .
i believe that someone who had the power to get close murdered him .
no one else had access to that room
except alvarez and the feds .
the guy coming after me is malcolm black .
he forced me to launder money or he would kill amanda .
and now i have to find him .
david owes malcolm a lot of money .
if it &apos;s money this malcolm wants ,
there is another solution .
i trust that you &apos;ll get that in the right hands
and keep mine clean .
tell me what you can .
how about i start with where i &apos;ve been the last 10 years ?
you weren &apos;t in that silo , were you ?
there &apos;s a man more dangerous than conrad .
he &apos;ll kill us all !
as long as malcolm black is out there ,
our lives are in danger .
david , you had no right to keep me in the dark for so long !
i should &apos;ve told you the truth sooner ,
but you don &apos;t have to worry about malcolm .
i &apos;m dealing with him .
that man has attacked you relentlessly .
what makes you think he &apos;ll back off now ?
because he values his freedom more than money .
threatening him with evidence
is a temporary solution at best , david .
go to the fbi and ask for protection .
they can &apos;t help us . look , i know how to stop him .
you gave away millions of his fortune .
men like him do not stop until reparations have been made .
emily has enough .
no .
no .
no , i was a prisoner for 10 years .
i &apos;ll die before i have to give in to him .
david ...
emily is a way out .
go to her . ask for her help .
listen , i will protect us .
but i need you to trust me
and to promise me that you will not interfere .
i &apos;ll do what &apos;s best .
i &apos;ll be back tonight .
thanks for meeting me this morning .
we have to make this quick .
i have a very busy day .
you probably want to think about slowing ... down .
listen to me .
i made some calls ,
and i got you in with dr. vioni .
she &apos;s the best ob @-@ gyn in the city .
no , i didn &apos;t ask you to do that .
i didn &apos;t ask you to do anything .
i &apos;m not asking you to take me back ,
but we have to figure this out .
no matter how you feel about me , our child needs a father .
a father ? like the one you had ?
i &apos;m sorry .
but the baby has changed things for me .
and we both have to admit something
has changed in you , as well .
i can &apos;t trust the man you &apos;ve become ,
not when someone else &apos;s life depends on it .
just ...
look , i understand you &apos;re still angry .
oh , i &apos;m not angry .
i &apos;m realistic .
you &apos;re very good at saying the perfect thing
when life is easy , but when choices get hard ,
you run away .
there &apos;s only one of us running , margaux .
it &apos;s not me .
i &apos;ve hacked all of kate taylor &apos;s personnel @-@ review files
in the fbi mainframe .
i mean , after reading this ,
i want to write her a letter of recommendation myself .
top of her class at quantico ,
proficiency medals in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat and firearms .
i even checked her finances .
she &apos;s clean and ...
well @-@ diversified , i might add .
just means she &apos;s as good as i am at hiding her secrets .
or maybe it means she &apos;s not dirty .
i already feel douche @-@ baggy enough
after what i did to louise .
she did not deserve it .
i sure as hell am not gonna do the same thing
to a federal agent .
they hold grudges ...
and arrest warrants .
i trust my instincts , nolan .
kate had access to the prisoner
who was murdered at the police station .
i think she was tying up loose ends .
for our faceless crime boss ,
malcolm black ,
who i can &apos;t even find a picture of , by the way ?
rumor has it that he operates out of a secure compound ,
but nobody knows where .
don &apos;t do that .
the tracking device you planted on his thug
didn &apos;t lead anywhere ?
uh , yeah , it did --
straight to a morgue in detroit .
eliminating loose ends seems to be malcolm &apos;s go @-@ to move .
then kate taylor really is my only way to find him .
emily . hey .
hi .
it &apos;s funny bumping into you here .
i was dropping off some files with agent taylor .
i was just checking out the conference room
for an event that i &apos;m planning .
oh , i thought maybe you were checking up on jack .
him and kate ?
yeah , everybody at the station has got a little pool going on those two .
i &apos;m s @-@ sorry . i thought ...
i &apos;m so sorry . i got to go .
anyone ever tell you to let the girl win ?
that would &apos;ve just pissed you off more .
nice read .
would &apos;ve made an excellent profiler .
shut up .
what made you change jobs , anyway ?
fieldwork &apos;s more satisfying .
i hate that i have to go into work ...
especially with you leaving .
well , actually , i do have a few vacation days banked .
don &apos;t ...
don &apos;t get cocky , porter .
not everything &apos;s about you .
well , you keep telling yourself that .
since you are staying ,
come with me to the reopening of
nolan &apos;s yacht club tonight .
that &apos;s right .
you &apos;re the rookie who knows everyone who &apos;s anyone .
nolan ross , david clarke ,
emily thorne .
so , is that a yes ?
i have to see who rsvps first .
you &apos;re gonna fit right in .
permission to come aboard ?
sharks belong in the water , not on my deck .
though , you &apos;re more of a bottom @-@ feeder , aren &apos;t you ?
louise , i feel awful that i helped margaux
with that hit job .
i asked her to kill the story .
she wouldn &apos;t . i am truly sorry .
so you said in your e @-@ mails ...
and texts .
you are persistent . i &apos;ll give you that .
i even left you a voicemail , for god sakes .
louise , don &apos;t go .
let me help you put that story in your rearview .
now , are you trying to assuage your guilt ?
&apos;cause if so ...
carry on .
well , let &apos;s give those vultures something else to talk about .
after all , we &apos;re both fixtures of the tabloids .
can you imagine the headlines we would cause
if you co @-@ hosted my event with me tonight ?
we would be
like the wonder twins of gossip .
what do you say ?
i &apos;ll say , &quot; wonder twins , activate . &quot;
form of &quot; party of the summer . &quot;
i &apos;ve called in a favor .
the district attorney has agreed
to remove you from the witness list .
you won &apos;t have to testify at the trial .
gina was assaulted at my party , dad .
she needs all the help she can get .
you know the defense will destroy her character on the stand .
well ... with good reason .
why do you think a girl from rockport
was even at your party in the first place ?
this is a shakedown of your friend .
drew anderson &apos;s no friend of mine .
andrew is a fraternity brother ,
which might as well be blood .
he took advantage of her , dad , and bragged about it later .
i have to testify .
daniel , your classmate has a powerful father
with equally powerful friends .
i &apos;m hoping that you can recognize
how that works for you rather than against you .
if you could defend this girl
without jeopardizing your own future ,
i might even encourage you to do so ,
but that is not the case .
why is my future more important than hers ?
i once asked myself the same question .
i &apos;ll tell you what your grandfather taught me .
this world that we &apos;ve created is made up of gods and insects .
and it &apos;s not fair , but that is the reality .
don &apos;t concern yourself with the well @-@ being of ants , son .
if you can see life through that lens ,
your choices will become simpler , easier to make ...
... and live with .
are you all right , mr. grayson ?
is there anything i can get you ?
no , i &apos;m fine .
actually , i have some , uh ...
i have items in storage .
can you bring them out to my room ?
jack .
is it true ?
are you seeing kate taylor ?
how did you even know about that ?
you spying on me or her ?
look , i think she was involved
with the attacks on my father .
what are you talking about ?
my father lied .
conrad didn &apos;t hold him captive .
it was a man named malcolm black .
i believe that kate is his operative .
she &apos;s a federal agent .
who chose a rookie to work her case ...
the son @-@ in @-@ law of david clarke , her target .
the case is closed , ems .
kate &apos;s going back to d.c.
then i bet she &apos;ll find a reason to stay .
look , if i &apos;m right about her , she &apos;s dangerous .
i had to warn you . i ...
i couldn &apos;t live with myself if something happened to you .
a long way from the prison yard , huh , kern ?
longer for you .
i got paroled .
you were resurrected .
yeah , i suppose so .
do you have it ?
i &apos;ll always come through for my old cellmate .
but your request did catch me by surprise .
this was never your style .
i &apos;m not the same man anymore .
and i &apos;m not judging .
after what they did ,
they deserve far worse .
atropa belladonna .
will take down a 200 @-@ pound man .
will look like a stroke ... basically untraceable .
perfect .
just be sure you have no doubts .
there &apos;s no turning back .
sorry to startle you , mrs. grayson .
agent taylor from the fbi .
we met the other day at the hospital .
had a few follow @-@ up questions
regarding the attacks on mr. clarke .
i &apos;m late for an appointment in the city ,
and i already told investigators that i don &apos;t know anything .
a new piece of evidence came across my desk , and ...
i wanted to get your thoughts on it .
i was able to trace this photograph back to you .
mind explaining the message ?
i didn &apos;t send it .
and i question how you would prove that i did .
we &apos;re the fbi , mrs. grayson .
that &apos;s what we do .
so , why don &apos;t you cooperate
and tell me how emily thorne is involved in all this ?
that &apos;s a bush @-@ league question , agent taylor .
i thought i was dealing with a professional .
fine .
emily thorne was cellmates
with david clarke &apos;s daughter , amanda .
and what does that tell you ?
that they shared a special bond .
oh , &quot; special &quot; wouldn &apos;t even begin to cover it .
how so ?
emily will do anything for david ,
including erasing his debts .
which , judging by your reaction ,
might prove interesting to your employer .
i work for the united states taxpayers , mrs. grayson .
and i do so miss my dearly departed husband .
now , only one of those statements can be verified .
shall i call quantico and share my theories
about your extracurricular activities ?
what is it you want ?
just for david and i to have the relationship
we were denied years ago , free from anyone &apos;s interference .
well , ms. thorne is a very wealthy girl ,
but i don &apos;t see why she would go to such extremes
to help david clarke .
what &apos;s the connection ?
you &apos;re the fbi . figure it out .
and once you do , take your money and leave us the hell alone .
so , uh , i am running kate &apos;s prints
through a data @-@ mining program .
if she &apos;s hiding something , i &apos;ll find it ,
but it &apos;s gonna take a while .
what about the feed from the room ?
anything interesting ?
well , for starters , she &apos;s a total slob ,
but i did find something useful
while you were engaged in your tête @-@ à @-@ jack .
she &apos;s just texting someone .
on a phone that &apos;s in direct violation
of anti @-@ corruption protocol .
all agents are supposed to register their secondary phones ,
but kate never did .
she &apos;s on a satcom with a digital scrambler ,
which is kind of ideal
for staying in touch with paranoid shut @-@ ins .
if i get the phone , can you trace the text ?
i can pinpoint malcolm black to a 10 @-@ foot radius .
did jack rsvp to your party ?
he did -- plus one .
but , ems , don &apos;t even think of turning my club
into your own personal battlefield .
i just paid for new uniforms .
if everything goes right ,
kate won &apos;t even know i &apos;m on to her .
when does anything ever go right
for the host of a hamptons &apos; party ...
with you on the guest list ?
i heard that .
&apos;course you did .
well , the copy is good ,
but i &apos;d like to use the photo
of the grayson global retreat in hawaii .
it &apos;s a better shot of david .
margaux ?
yes .
what &apos;s wrong ?
was conrad always like he was at the end ?
was he ever ... different ?
when he was young .
he wasn &apos;t kind ,
but he wasn &apos;t cruel ... then .
what changed him ?
oh , i suppose he had a lot to prove .
growing up under the shadow of a powerful father
is a terrible burden for a child --
something you know well .
this isn &apos;t about conrad , is it ?
this is about you and daniel .
i &apos;m pregnant .
does he know ?
but you &apos;re thinking of going it alone ?
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m even considering it .
i was so lonely as a child .
my father was never home .
always came second to his work .
then why push daniel away ?
he was once full of hope ...
a beautiful young man .
but something changed in him .
and now there &apos;s so much more at stake .
you know , i was once faced with raising a baby alone .
but i couldn &apos;t .
i was 16 years old , and our circumstances were dire .
your situation is different .
but no matter how capable a mother ,
a child deserves a father .
even one like him ?
daniel &apos;s not conrad , and i know the difference .
which is why i also know that
the good man you need is still there .
daniel loves you .
but what if i don &apos;t love him anymore ?
your tears suggest otherwise .
well , my , my .
southern girls certainly do know how to put on a hootenanny .
don &apos;t use that word .
why ?
&apos;cause you can &apos;t pull it off .
well , you &apos;re certainly right about one thing --
we are the couple of the moment .
oh , yes .
lolan is trending .
okay , we have to thank our fans with a selfie .
what &apos;s your good side ?
same as you ... all of them .
tag me -- nolman 88 .
why 88 ?
well , some details of my private life i don &apos;t make public .
don &apos;t turn around .
i &apos;m sorry that i kept you in the dark .
i know how hard that &apos;s been for you .
i can handle myself .
i know .
but i can &apos;t have you involved in what happens next .
when you hear there &apos;s trouble ,
do not come running .
it &apos;s all part of a larger plan .
don &apos;t go after malcolm black on your own , please .
let me help you .
did my father mention anything
about going after malcolm black ?
no , nothing .
nolan , if he did , tell me .
ems , i swear he didn &apos;t say anything .
then he really is working alone .
i need to get to malcolm first .
well , your best and only option
just walked through the front door .
jack . you made it .
emily .
this is kate taylor .
i was hoping to meet you .
think i ... saw you at the hospital .
and , uh , at the police station .
we &apos;re like two ships that keep passing in the night .
oh , at least we &apos;re not crashing into each other .
ah , well , the night is still young .
jack , who is your lovely damsel in this stunning dress ?
oh , whoops .
nothing worse than a party foul from he who throws the party .
i &apos;ve been hit with worse . uh , name &apos;s kate .
nolan ross . uh , but you knew that .
and i am so sorry about the dress .
that one notwithstanding , rest of the drinks tonight on me .
do you have a ...
ladies ... around the corner .
thanks .
you okay ?
if she &apos;s corrupt , i want to know .
if she &apos;s not , i want an apology .
&quot; dear dad , my whole life , i &apos;ve been told
&quot; i was destined for greatness
&quot; based solely on the virtue of my name . &quot;
i thought you could use this .
i &apos;ve spilled my fair share of drinks .
thanks .
jack &apos;s said some nice things about you .
really ?
is that surprising ?
oh , we &apos;re just ... having a little fun .
nothing serious .
well , that &apos;s as good as it &apos;s gonna get .
thanks for the assist .
of course .
scram .
how i enjoy toying with the weaker sex .
uh , well , that includes me , too , doesn &apos;t it ?
see , i just heard
that you are hitting the open seas tomorrow after all .
thought we were okay .
we are .
things will never be okay with me and my brother .
so this is about the article .
particularly the passage
hinting at the real story behind the ellis family .
see , my brother values our secrets .
he &apos;ll do anything to keep them buried .
i cannot go through that again .
i have to get the hell away from him .
running -- not the answer .
there is another way out of this , louise ...
... if you &apos;re up for it .
enjoy .
i wasn &apos;t sure you &apos;d come .
yeah , i wouldn &apos;t have ,
except you said it involved margaux .
she told me , daniel , and i am so happy for you .
stop . stop it .
i &apos;ve always dreamed of you and mar--
stop . i know what you &apos;re doing .
you &apos;re trying to control the situation .
i &apos;m not .
and i resent the accusation .
this is always ... this is what you do .
you always do this . you ...
yesterday , i would &apos;ve fought with you ,
but i can &apos;t keep repeating the same mistakes .
i &apos;m gonna be a father .
and you &apos;re going to be a great one , daniel .
no , i don &apos;t know .
i think margaux was right .
i &apos;ve ... i &apos;ve changed .
daniel .
she &apos;s only reacting out of fear .
that &apos;s all .
which is exactly what i &apos;ve been doing for most of my life .
you know , i walked away from sara in that accident .
i sided with dad when you gave me that evidence .
i shot my ex @-@ wife .
don &apos;t make excuses for her , daniel .
she put you through hell .
she forced us to face the truth .
and you know what ? i &apos;m -- i &apos;m grateful
because it means i can &apos;t hide from it anymore .
you &apos;ve suffered , as well .
mom , we have to stop lying to ourselves .
look at what you &apos;re doing to david .
does he know the truth ?
does he have any idea what you did to him ?
no . of course not .
no , &apos; cause you manipulated him instead .
because surviving is all that matters ,
just like dad said .
but he was wrong .
no , surviving &apos;s not living ... it &apos;s hiding .
yeah , we throw big parties ,
give ourselves awards to cover up the truth .
we &apos;re not special .
we &apos;re cowards .
now , if i get the chance ,
i &apos;m teaching my child to be better than that .
i &apos;m done running .
i hope you are , too .
you would think the fbi would teach their agents
not to leave their bags unattended .
so , what &apos;s next ?
nolan pinpoints malcolm &apos;s location .
jack , you distract kate so i can return her phone
without her realizing it &apos;s missing .
this is not how i expected to spend my summer .
okay , hacked , sealed , delivered .
i think you have my phone ... amanda .
it was the only thing that made sense .
and you &apos;re better than i thought .
i didn &apos;t even notice you lift my phone .
you really want to do this here ?
i didn &apos;t come here to fight .
i need your help .
when i figured out who you were ,
i realized you &apos;re the one who took down conrad grayson .
someone had to .
now you have to do the same to malcolm .
he &apos;s forcing me to work for him ...
just like he did with your father , and he has my mother .
why should i believe you ?
what would i possibly have to gain by outing myself to you ?
i &apos;m desperate .
you &apos;re being watched ?
always .
why don &apos;t we slip away ... somewhere safe ?
then i &apos;ll tell you exactly how we save your father and my mother .
do we have a deal ?
my house . 30 minutes .
i was starting to get worried .
i was in the city with daniel .
he , uh -- he seemed different today ,
like i &apos;d never seen him before .
i was proud of him .
i &apos;m glad .
did you do what you needed today ?
yes . it &apos;s all taken care of .
everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
why is my future more important than hers ?
i received your letter ...
a beautifully penned suicide note .
please don &apos;t try to stop me , dad .
i won &apos;t . i get it .
you &apos;re a man now ,
facing the first real choice of your adult life .
i simply want you to be aware of its implications .
so , do you remember the fable of momus ?
yeah , the god of ... writers and poets .
he criticized his fellow gods for their shortcomings .
and how was he rewarded for his honesty ?
they banished him from olympus .
so , that &apos;s why you &apos;re here -- to threaten me ?
no , no . i &apos;m here to warn you , son .
look , siding with that girl , wronged as she may be ,
sends a message to your peers .
these are the same people
who may one day hold your future in their hands .
now , you do this today ,
and they will turn their backs on you
just as surely as the gods banished momus .
yeah , well , i guess i &apos;ll have to make it on my own .
daniel , daniel .
i beg you to consider what that means .
i mean , do you really believe
that you can still succeed out here in the real world
based solely on your own , uh , ingenuity and -- and talent ?
because i couldn &apos;t !
and that &apos;s not easy for me to admit ,
but that -- that &apos;s the truth .
luckily , we were both born with a great advantage --
our family legacy .
i mean , do you really want
to throw that precious gift away on this ?
ask yourself , is this the cause
you want to risk everything on ?
i didn &apos;t expect to hear from you .
i &apos;m at your hotel . where are you ?
i drove to my old house .
daniel , are you okay ?
no .
no .
i haven &apos;t been for awhile .
you were right about me .
no .
no , i wasn &apos;t .
that &apos;s what i want to tell you .
i was the one running , not you .
i was doing what my father did ...
disappearing when life got hard .
but i don &apos;t want to be like him .
i don &apos;t want to be like mine .
we can be better together .
please , daniel , come home .
i need you .
we need you .
you were , uh , upset with me this morning
for keeping secrets from you , and you were right to be .
i don &apos;t want to hide anymore .
you don &apos;t have to tell me anything , david .
yes , i do .
see , i never imagined that life could be worse than prison .
but now i have hope , and i know i can finally be free .
to our future .
i @-@ i can &apos;t keep doing this .
i can &apos;t keep running from the truth .
there &apos;s something you need to know .
20 years ago , i stole your computer ,
and i gave it to conrad so he could frame you .
i betrayed you .
quite the compound .
though it doesn &apos;t seem much like you .
it isn &apos;t . but it &apos;s a good cover .
guess that would explain the lack of staff .
this isn &apos;t government issue .
it &apos;s black market .
unless i &apos;m sorely mistaken ,
we &apos;re not doing this one by the book .
i didn &apos;t want anything traced back to me .
if you can &apos;t trust me , fine .
i &apos;ll take my chances on my own .
but the best shot we have of saving our parents
is to work together , huh ?
why are you telling me this now ?
because i love you . i always have .
you ruined my life for money .
no .
i was afraid .
what ?
why did you choose the man that you were afraid of ?
i didn &apos;t . i was frightened of you .
we were going to take the children and start a new life .
and i knew the risks , but i believed in us .
and that &apos;s when i found out
the secret you &apos;d been hiding about your wife .
kara ?
you told me she was dead , david .
i bought every word of it ,
and you made your daughter believe it , too .
she was sick . amanda was only a child .
she wouldn &apos;t have understood .
i would have !
i waited for you to tell me the truth , but you never did .
and in the moment i needed to trust you the most ,
you made me doubt you .
and i hated you for it .
then conrad ... told me about the bombing ,
and daniel and i were trapped .
and i was terrified of losing my son .
and in my rage ,
i used you to get us out of it .
i swear i regretted that decision ever since .
david , i am so sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i know i don &apos;t deserve your forgiveness , but ...
... i &apos;m asking for it .
see , normally , i research all of my targets ,
but ... there &apos;s nothing on malcolm .
he thinks secrets make him untouchable .
but i know how to draw him out into the open .
we just need to use the right bait .
money .
specifically , the fortune your father took from him .
oh , he never told you ?
before david escaped , he drained most of malcolm &apos;s accounts
and funneled the money into charities across the world .
it was his way of making amends for the things he &apos;d done .
the thing is ,
malcolm never believed david gave the money away .
so he sent you here to find it .
lucky for us , you have enough to make him think i did .
if you wire the cash into an account only he can access --
and we take him down once he goes to claim it .
that &apos;s a good plan .
i guess my only question is ...
... when you planning on killing me ?
well , i was planning on after we got your money , but ...
plans change .
so , the mother story was a lie .
barely .
she is with malcolm ,
but that &apos;s because he &apos;s my father .
secret daughter in the fbi .
that &apos;s an excellent insurance policy .
god , i have to know .
what tipped you off ?
i never believed you .
i just wanted to get you away from innocent civilians
and in front of my security cameras .
oh , don &apos;t worry . you won &apos;t see them .
one of the many perks of having a genius as a best friend .
your cover is blown .
well , i &apos;ll just have to delete the drives
before i go , then .
guess you didn &apos;t notice this time , either .
well , i would say that a toast is in order .
to emily and kate ?
no , to my party surviving unscathed .
i mean , it &apos;s a hamptons &apos; freakin &apos; miracle .
right . to the important stuff .
are you still looking into kate &apos;s background ?
oh , yeah .
i forgot that was running .
uh , why ? anything juicy ?
call emily .
tell her not to let kate in the house !
why ? ! what &apos;s wrong ? !
emily !
what happened to you ?
get out of here ! run !
no !
drop it !
why didn &apos;t you listen to me , daniel ?
i told you to run !
why didn &apos;t you run ?
&quot; dear dad , my whole life , i &apos;ve been told
&quot; i was destined for greatness
&quot; based solely on the virtue of my name .
&quot; i was taught sacrifice was for the foolish .
&quot; survival was all that mattered .
&quot; but now i find myself at a crossroads ,
&quot; and i must decide what i believe to be true .
&quot; there is no such thing as destiny .
&quot; legacies must be earned by the choices we make .
&quot; i now know that we write our own endings ,
&quot; and we can either choose to hide as villains
or live as heroes . &quot;
you &apos;re gonna be okay , daniel .
you &apos;re gonna be okay .
you &apos;re still lying to me .
i want you to know that it wasn &apos;t all a lie .
not with you .
i know .
