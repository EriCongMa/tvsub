第六季 第三集
No, that's not what he said.
No, it's not.
Because it isn't.
No, I...
Look...
No. Listen, I have to go.
You can sit.
Mr. Agos... A-gos?
Agos.
Agos.
Mr. Agos, I am your pretrial service officer,
Joy Grubick.
You've been released on bond awaiting trial
and your release has come with certain conditions.
My job is to see to it that you live up to those conditions
and to report to the court on your compliance.
Do you understand?
I do.
In my supervisory capacity,
I will regularly meet with you, your lawyer, your employer,
and other collateral witnesses to ascertain your fitness
for continued bond release. Hmm?
You are currently employed?
I am.
I-I don't see any entry
for direct supervisory employer here.
Yeah, I don't really have an employer.
I'm a partner at my law firm.
I need a name.
Alicia Florrick. My other partner.
You need any information on drug or alcohol treatment programs
while subject to release?
No.
Have you used any controlled substances
since your release?
No.
Have you partaken of any alcoholic beverages?
Mm, no... A beer.
One beer?
Yes.
And...
when did you consume this beer?
Uh, after my release.
There was a celebration with a few coworkers.
Mm... Was this at a bar?
No, at my apartment.
You said this was a celebration with a few people.
And who were they?
You want to know their names?
Yes.
Actually, it was probably just one.
I need a name.
Kalinda. Sharma.
Let me see your hand.
Although you are not explicitly forbidden alcohol,
we would advise against any triggers for abuse.
I understand.
How are you handling your release, Mr. Agos?
How am I handling it?
Fine, I guess. I wasn't in that long.
Any disagreements at work?
We need more space. I can't bring my clients here.
We're already overextended. We can't just...
All right, everyone stop.
No, everything went well.
Well, how's your employer handling your return?
Alicia?
That is the heart and soul of Lockhart/Gardner.
We took their six top department heads.
Why are you screwing this u...
She handled it very well.
A condition of your bail is that you
inform your clients of your current status.
Have you done so, either by letter or in person?
Yes, in person.
And what did you say?
Two weeks ago I was arrested for transporting
$1.3 million in heroin.
Um... Obviously, I didn't do it.
In fact, we think that the state's attorney brought these charges
because Cary is such an effective advocate.
I still plan to be involved with all my cases,
but we also have other attorneys who are willing to step in
We don't want any interruption in your service.
We want to keep you as a client.
So what do you think, Mr. Clay?
And did you lose any clients after informing them of your status?
Yeah, a few.
How many?
Four.
And who have you retained?
Cary,
I had some issues in my youth.
Stole a car.
Went for a joyride, crashed into some barbed wire.
I was in jail for four months.
That's where I turned my life around.
Forgiveness isn't just a nicety to me,
it's my life.
So, yes, I want you to stay on my case.
Thank you. Thank you, Ed.
Dean?
Mr. Pratt.
Dean Levine-Wilkins. Good to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Dean and I will argue in court,
but purely under Cary's supervision.
Good.
Yes, I know you have to get back to court.
Mr. Agos, let me give you some advice.
I do this because I care.
I know it doesn't sound like it,
but that's just the way I talk.
You can't live life the way you used to.
You can't just have a beer.
You can't just associate with your old friends.
You need to treat this seriously
or you will end up behind bars again.
You understand?
I think I do.
Good.
See you next week.
What is this, Mr. Pratt?
It's a seed.
A seed.
A seed with a genetic protective shell?
Yes. Our scientists call it a full metal jacket.
A full metal jacket.
Objection. We all heard, including His Honor.
Again, the defense attorney is abusing his objections.
You're objecting to my objections?
You know what you're doing...
Stop it, everybody stop!
The objection is overruled.
Let's go, Mr. Schmidt.
I mean, Mr.... you.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Pratt, you're a farmer yourself, aren't you?
I am. My dad, too. Four generations.
And that's why you started the company?
Yes. We wanted to create a seed
that could genetically withstand whatever nature threw at it.
Okay, so how much did it cost to develop this seed?
This seed here?
$400 million.
$400 million.
Well, then why are you suing Mr. Keller?
He's a farmer just like yourself, isn't he?
Patent infringement.
We received a tip he was brown-bagging.
I'm sorry-- brown-bagging?
Uh, saving and replanting seeds from his harvest.
Okay, the Supreme Court held in J.E.M. Ag Supply v. Pioneer
that saving patented seeds is illegal?
It's my own seed.
On my own land.
Your Honor.
He's simply stating the obvious.
He can state the obvious when you're questioning him...
Mr. Levine-Wilkins has yet to even establish...
Shut up!
We're taking a five-minute recess.
Alicia, watch it with Ed.
I don't think he likes all the fighting.
It's just bluster.
I know that, but he doesn't.
Mr. Pratt, do you have a monopoly on seed distribution
in Kane County, Illinois?
I don't know if I'd call it a monopoly.
My seeds are very popular.
Isn't my client the only farmer in Kane
who doesn't use your seeds?
Yes, I think that's right.
And that makes him a target?
Objection, Your Honor. Argumentative.
Sustained. Move on, Mr. Schmidt.
Thank you. I have here a chart
from the National Weather Service.
Can you tell me what it shows?
Wind speed and wind direction.
Good. Now, every farm surrounding Mr. Keller's land
uses your seeds,
so isn't it possible that these high winds
blew your patented seeds onto my client's field?
Objection. Calls for speculation.
If Mr. Schmidt wants to question a meteorologist,
then bring in a meteorologist.
Sustained. Move on, Mr. Schmidt.
I have some good news.
And some bad news?
No, just... good news.
You're so tense.
The state's attorney lost its witness against you.
What?
The confidential informant on Bishop's crew--
the one wearing the wire.
He was the cornerstone of the case.
And they lost him.
How did they lose him?
I have no idea.
He just went missing.
He was scared of testifying.
But without him, the state's attorney has no case.
It's not over yet.
The ASA is asking for a continuance at 2:00.
But I-I do think the judge will dismiss.
So don't lose hope.
Did Bishop get to him?
The C.I.-- did Bishop get to him?
Oh, I don't think he knew about him.
Anyway, I've got to go.
I'll see you at 2:00.
Thank you, Diane.
You said they had a C.I. with a wire.
Yeah.
I think that's gonna take care of itself.
It's because you know you have no case.
I see you've forgotten the rules of questioning!
You three get so excited about winning arguments,
you forget the point!
Mrs. Florrick.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Mrs. Toms, is that man over there a customer
at your feed and seed store?
Yes, ma'am. He bought our non-GMO seeds.
He wasn't anti-GMO or anything, just...
he said he didn't want to pay big prices.
And did he stop buying these seeds in 2012?
Yeah. He told my husband...
Objection, Your Honor. Hearsay.
804 exception, Your Honor.
Declarant is unavailable.
Mrs. Toms' husband is deceased.
That doesn't make any difference.
Wait. Wait.
Mrs. Toms, did Mr. Keller ever discuss with you directly
why he stopped buying seeds?
No.
Then I sustain the objection.
Your Honor, this is ridiculous.
What's ridiculous is Mrs. Florrick
not being able to accept a loss...
Hey! Shut up!
Did you call?
My wife did. She has time.
Good.
We're gonna have to tell them. The lawyers?
It's just better to give them a foregone conclusion.
What foregone conclusion?
Cary... this isn't working for us.
What isn't?
The trial.
Sir, you should be talking to your own lawyer.
That's the problem.
It's about the lawyers, not us.
Wendell is my neighbor.
I have a disagreement with him,
not with you all.
My wife just called an arbitrator.
He can start with us immediately.
Well, Ed, arbitration is exactly like court.
Just as binding, just as...
This is different.
Welcome to binding Christian arbitration.
My name is Del Paul.
Mr. Pratt and Mr. Keller have requested this forum
because they believe there is a better way
than the adversarial approach of blame and denial.
It's called the Matthew process.
And yes, lawyers, that is a real thing.
Jesus tells us: if your brother sins,
go and point out his fault, just between the two of you.
And if he doesn't listen, take one or two others along
so that every matter may be established
by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
So, why don't we begin?
Let us pray.
Lord, we thank you for this day,
and we thank you for these professionals
who just want to see justice done.
Mr. Pratt, do you have a monopoly on seed distribution
in Kane County, Illinois?
Well, I don't know if I'd call it a monopoly.
My seeds are very popular.
Isn't my client the only farmer
in Kane who doesn't use your seeds?
Yes, I think that's right.
And that makes him a target?
Objection. Argumentative. Come on.
Go ahead, you can answer.
Uh, sorry, sir, but the question was inflammatory.
No. I think he can handle it. Go ahead.
Wendell is only a target in the sense that
if people take my seed without paying,
I would go out of business.
I have here a chart from the National Weather Service.
Can you tell me what it shows?
Wind speed, wind direction.
Isn't it possible
these high winds blew your patented seed onto my client's field?
Objection. Calls for speculation.
If you want to question a meteorologist, Mr. Schmidt, do so.
Del.
I'm feeling a little attacked here.
Look, every answer will only get us closer to the truth.
So, let's just answer honestly.
Okay, Your Honor... uh, Del,
that is an improper question.
It seems proper to me.
Not for a layman, or a non-meteorologist.
But Mr. Pratt must have an opinion. We all do.
So, let's just hear his.
Well, sure, it's possible.
It's possible high winds blew your seed onto my client's land?
Sure.
Well, if that's true,
isn't it possible this seed on his land is just...
part of God's plan?
Without their confidential informant, Your Honor,
the state's attorney's office has no case.
We have a recording of the defendant perpetrating this crime.
Allegedly perpetrating.
And my client has a Sixth Amendment right
to confront his accuser.
Which presupposes that Trey Wagner is our only witness.
Is he?
No.
Ah, here's the accused now.
Come join us in the lovely bond court.
My apologies, Your Honor. I was in court on another matter.
The fact that the ASA has requested a delay in preliminary
suggests that he has no evidence
other than this one witness.
I'm afraid that Ms. Lockhart has been misinformed about our motion.
We're not asking for a delay in preliminary.
We're asking for revocation of bail.
Your Honor, this is... What has Mr. Agos
ever done to warrant revocation of bail?
The day that Mr. Agos was released from holding,
the primary witness against him, Trey Wagner, disappeared.
That is completely irrelevant.
We have evidence Mr. Agos intimidated the witness.
What evidence?
A report from his pretrial services officer
that he met with Kalinda Sharma after his release.
Kalinda Sharma then approached Trey Wagner.
Your Honor, this is attack by supposition.
Which is why we need a revocation of bail hearing.
Mr. Agos has already
been through a source of funds hearing.
Now the county wants a revocation of bail hearing?
This is... this is Kafka in action.
The longer I live, the more I realize
that everything is Kafka in action.
I will hear arguments on Tuesday.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Next.
They're gonna get me one way or another.
Well, that's not what he said.
No, it isn't.
No, no, that's not what he said.
No, he didn't say that.
Uh... no. Look, I have to go. Good-bye.
Hi. My name is Joy Grubick,
and I'm the pretrial service officer for Cary Agos.
And as such, it is my job to write a report to the court
on Cary's compliances with, uh, his bond obligations.
Looks like you already did that.
I'm sorry?
You already did that.
The court is holding a revocation of bail hearing
based on your report.
No, no, no.
That was based on my notes.
Ah. Well, that's a comfort.
You're Mr. Agos' employer?
No, I'm his partner.
Well, yes, but, for my report, I need to declare an employer.
Well, that's too bad, because he doesn't have an employer.
Okay.
And how has Cary been doing at work, mrs. Florrick?
We took their six top department heads.
Why are you fighting me on this?
Because this is B.S.
They are not ours!
They want to change...
Well. He's doing well.
Good.
I understand he was in court yesterday and today.
Yesterday, but not today.
And afterwards, after court?
Alicia, do you have a minute?
What's up?
We heard you were staffing your campaign office.
You... No. Where did you hear that?
A reporter called me for comment.
She asked if I had a position on your campaign.
I didn't even know there was a campaign to have an opinion about.
Yes?
You want to hear what happened afterwards, right?
Yes, after court.
The state's attorney met with me.
I see. Was Cary Agos with you?
No. Mr. Castro just came to see me.
Well, then it's not important. We can move on.
You don't want to hear about Mr. Castro threatening Cary?
I'm not threatening Cary.
It sounds like you did.
No.
I'm saying, Cary's case will go away
if he testifies against Bishop.
That's what we call plea bargaining.
Mr. Castro, you don't come to Cary, who's in the next room.
You don't come to his lawyer, Diane Lockhart. You come to me.
Who are you really threatening here?
I really don't need to hear all this.
You don't want to hear about
the state's attorney's threats?
They're not relevant to my report.
But I'm not finished yet.
Are you asking whether this has anything to do with your campaign?
Let's just be clear, Mr. Castro.
You're making a connection between Cary Agos' prosecution
and your campaign for State's Attorney.
No. I'm doing the opposite.
I'm saying Cary's prosecution has nothing to do with politics.
But...
Here we go.
Well, it won't look good for your campaign, will it?
Your partner being in prison.
You want to repeat that, Mr. Castro?
No... but...
I will say this.
It's a bad idea to run, Alicia.
Very few saints survive oppo research.
I'm not running.
I'm gonna stop you right there.
You don't want to hear more?
No, it's just that that's all the time we have.
But thank you.
And good luck.
With?
With your campaign.
I heard about it on the drive in.
It was on Morning Edition.
Eli, what...?
I know. I heard the Morning Edition thing, too.
I had nothing to do with it.
They said I opened a campaign office.
No, they quoted a blog saying you opened a campaign office.
But you haven't, so the quote is wrong.
Mr. Gold, Mrs. Florrick is here to see you.
Thank you, Nora. Your precognitive powers amaze me.
Tell them it's wrong.
What?
Tell them I'm not running.
No. You just feed the fire if you tell them things.
No. I feed the fire. You feed them on background.
Okay, talk to Steve Inskeep at the fund-raiser tomorrow.
What? No. Who?
From Morning Edition.
He'll be at the fund-raiser tomorrow night. Did you forget?
No. When?
7:00 p.M. Talk to him.
It's the only way to nip this in the bud.
I have to get to church.
Good. Atheism doesn't play anyway.
Congratulations,
Ms. State's Attorney.
Actually, no, it's all wrong. I'm not running.
Really? Did you hear Morning Edition?
They got it wrong. I'm not running.
Cary, do you have a second?
How was your P.S.O. interview?
Good. Or I don't know. I had a bit of an edge.
But I'm not so sure that's a bad thing.
Well, thank you, and I've been thinking.
This-this rule change in arbitration
isn't necessarily a bad thing, either.
What are you thinking?
Mrs. Toms, is that man over there a customer at your seed store?
He is. Wendell bought our non-GMO seeds.
He wasn't anti-GMO or anything. Just...
GMO? Uh, what's that?
Genetically-modified organism.
Wendell said he just didn't want to pay big prices.
Good.
And did he stop buying seeds at your store in 2012?
Yeah. He told my husband that he...
Objection, Your Honor.
Del. Hearsay.
And, uh, rule 804 does not apply here.
Mrs. Toms is a widow,
and a Christian woman who has something to share, so...
Isn't that right, Mrs. Toms?
So, shouldn't she be allowed to speak honestly and forthrightly?
Well, first of all, you don't need to gild the lily.
Second of all, she hasn't said anything yet.
Yes, but, Del,
I know what she will say.
She has no firsthand knowledge of the events
she's being asked to give testimony for.
Mrs. Toms, have you been telling the truth here today?
I have.
Then you may answer the question.
Del?
Mr. Schmidt,
I know this may seem foreign to you,
but you have to trust the process.
Mrs. Toms, what did your departed husband tell you?
That Wendell said he didn't need to buy seed from us anymore
because he "Hit the mother lode."
And by "Hitting the mother lode,"
you believe that Mr. Keller was taking and planting Mr. Pratt's seeds?
Yeah. Why else would he not need our seed anymore?
Uh, can I break in here?
Why don't we ask him?
What?
Why don't we ask Wendell?
He's sitting right here. I'm staring right at him.
Why don't we just ask him?
Your Honor...
Del, he hasn't been sworn in.
Yes, but we've been trusting Mrs. Toms.
Why don't we just trust Wendell?
Mr. Keller,
have you been planting these seeds of Mr. Pratt's?
Del, I'm going to instruct my client not to answer.
No. Guys... See...
That's not how this works-- the Matthew process.
Just answer the question, just tell the truth.
Do I replant seed? Sure.
Always have, always will.
Ed's seeds? I don't know.
Is it possible some of Ed's seed got onto my land
and I replanted them? Sure.
Okay, well, uh, Del,
I congratulate our defendant on his honesty,
but that's our whole suit.
He admitted his complicity.
No.
Did you intend to plant these seeds, Wendell?
It doesn't matter if he intended to.
Intent is irrelevant to patent law.
He just admitted...
But intent is relevant here.
1 Samuel 16:7.
"God sees not as man sees,
for man looks at the outward appearance;
but God looks at the heart""
Come on. He just admitted to breaking the law.
No, he admitted to not being conscious of breaking the law.
Grace?
Do you have a minute?
Yeah.
"My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent.
It is the Lord who judges me."
So... doesn't that mean...
that you can sin and not even know it?
I guess.
So intent is irrelevant to guilt.
Yeah, but that's only one verse.
Yeah, but that's all I need. I'm just looking for a precedent.
That's called prooftexting, Mom. You can't do that.
You have to look at what the whole Bible says.
But aren't all the verses considered true?
Well, yeah, but you can't pick and choose.
I'm a lawyer. That's what I do.
So you really believe all this, Grace?
The Tower of Babel? Noah's Ark? Everything?
I don't know if it's all historically accurate.
But...
I think it can be true in another way.
What other way?
Well, you know, like poetry.
It can still be true even if it's not accurate.
Look,
if I wanted you to remember that God created everything,
I'd probably tell you a story about it happening in seven days.
Like, that doesn't actually mean that it happened in seven days.
It just means that I wanted you to remember
that God created everything.
Did you just... make all that up?
Yeah, why?
Well, it sounds... smart.
Well, thanks for being surprised.
Oh, my gosh.
Okay. So I can use the first quote.
What is it?
1 Corinthians.
And he'll come back at me with 1 Samuel 16:7.
What can I use?
Romans.
"I would not have known what sin was
had it not been for the law""
Right, good. The law. Yeah.
Oh, and look at his translation.
Um, I think it's American Standard Version.
Compare it to, uh, the Revised Standard.
"If a person sins and does something
The Lord has commanded not to do,
even if he doesn't know it, he is still guilty.
He is responsible for his sin""
Leviticus?
Chapter 5, verse 17.
I think it's pretty clear, Del.
Intent is not essential to sin.
Do you know what the penalty for that was, Alicia,
in Leviticus 5?
The burnt offering of a male sheep.
Are you suggesting Mr. Keller burn a sheep?
'Cause we could arrange that.
I see you've both done your homework.
Del, I would argue that New Testament commands hold sway
over Old Testament commands, just as Christ came to fulfill the law.
Not to abolish it.
Yeah, that's Matthew 5:17.
1 Corinthians 4: "My conscience is clear,
but that does not make me innocent."
Thank you. It's good to see you've all
become biblical scholars overnight.
But I would agree.
I may have been a little hasty yesterday.
Clearly the Scriptures are not as easy to unpack as I would like.
I'd like to reflect on this,
pray on it,
and I'll return with my decision.
Detective Prima, what are we... what are we looking at here?
That's Trey Wagner, our confidential informant
in Lemond Bishop's gang.
Your former confidential informant?
Yes, unfortunately, yes.
And these photos were taken...
A week ago.
The same night that Mr. Agos was released.
Here is another photo of Trey. And who is he with?
That's Kalinda Sharma, an investigator working for Mr. Agos' firm.
Look forward. No emotion.
And what happened after this photograph was taken, Detective?
Trey Wagner disappeared. We have reason to believe
that Ms. Sharma passed along a message from Mr. Agos...
Objection. Rank speculation.
Sustained.
So Trey Wagner was a witness against Mr. Agos?
That's right.
Tell me, do you know, was it a condition of his bail that
he not contact any of the witnesses?
It was.
Thank you, Detective.
Mrs. Wagner, your husband is a confidential informant
for the Chicago Police Department, is that correct?
I've been told that now. I didn't know before.
And when is the last time that you saw your husband, Mrs. Wagner?
Seven days ago. July 1.
Can you describe the last time you saw him?
He came home around midnight.
He was scared.
He said someone was gonna kill him.
And how did he know that?
Some Indian woman told him.
Don't turn around. Don't do anything.
Thank you, Mrs. Wagner. Your Honor,
Kalinda Sharma met Cary Agos the night
that he was released from holding.
20 minutes after that, Trey Wagner was warned by an Indian woman,
that he should be afraid for his life.
Kalinda...
I can't suborn perjury,
so I'm not gonna ask what you did or who you met with...
I think that's smart.
But I think it would be good if there were a way
to impeach Stacie Wagner's testimony.
I agree.
I'm not worried about suborning perjury.
Did you threaten Trey Wagner?
No.
You told Bishop he was the C.I.?
You don't want to know, Cary.
And then you warned Trey that Bishop was coming after him,
and that's why he took off.
I have to go.
I didn't know you were religious.
I almost became a priest.
Really? When?
Right out of high school.
Why didn't you?
To Kill a Mockingbird.
Yeah. That book created a lot of lawyers.
Yeah, I realized I wanted justice in this world, not the next.
You?
I don't know what I want.
Mrs. Florrick, hello.
My name is Joss Acker.
Hi, I'm Frank Seddio.
Before you completely staff up your campaign office,
I'm a member of the Black Caucus...
I think we met last year. I was in the audience at your speech.
Actually, actually, gentlemen, I'm not running,
and I have a reception to get to,
so...
African-Americans have been completely ignored
in campaign staffing for years now, Mrs. Florrick...
The governor said you would say that.
And I really want you to know...
Wait. What?
Diversity hires, Ma'am.
No, what did you say about the governor?
My husband?
Yes, he sent me to see you.
He...
Wait, Mrs. Florrick, please... Mrs. Florrick,
I think you have a real opportunity...
Alicia, good.
I need you to not talk about your campaign.
Oh, God, there is no campaign.
Exactly, I need you not to talk about it.
Where's Peter?
Other side of the stage. Why?
Have you seen Peter?
Oh, my God.
Oh, no, but thank you. I'm Gloria Steinem.
Yes. I know. Uh, Alicia Florrick.
I know that and, also, I know that your husband
is already speaking. They just introduced him.
But I hear you're going to run
for State's Attorney. That's great.
Oh, uh, no, it's, um, a little...
that was a little premature.
Why?
Because I'm-I'm...
not sure if I'm running.
And why aren't you sure?
Well, I'm a bit overwhelmed at the moment. You know-- life, work.
Okay, but show me the woman who isn't overwhelmed.
That is true, yes, but this is... I'm...
It wasn't my idea.
My-My husband's, um, chief of staff--he asked me to run.
Would you do a good job? You would.
Well, that's not... that-that's not the point.
No, I think it is the point. I think if you would
do a good job, you should run.
People respect you. And you could make a difference.
We need more good women to run.
Now please welcome feminist icon Gloria Steinem.
Alicia, it was great talking to you,
but I'm serious. Do run.
It's very nice talking to you, Alicia.
You could make it all the way to the Supreme Court, Alicia.
You're that amazing.
Thank you all. After much reflection and prayer
and returning to Scripture with an open heart,
I realized that I was wrong.
Knowledge of sin is to some extent irrelevant.
So I will hear arguments now
on the fact of Ed's seeds being planted on Wendell's land,
not just the intent.
Del, we maintain our objection.
I understand.
So...
you may call your next witness,
Alicia, Dean, Cary.
Derek Voss. I am a forensic botanist.
Mr. Pratt hired me to do a field study
on plants containing his seed's genetic marker.
After testing Mr. Keller's, uh, fields, what did you find?
I found that his fields went from an acceptable six percent,
uh, of Mr. Pratt's seeds to 89% in one year.
Can that be explained by, uh, blow-in?
No,
it's my conclusion that he's saving and replanting seeds.
Thank you.
Del, I'll be frank.
This is bad science.
We need an independent test using
top-of-the-line DNA sequencers.
And how long would that take?
Two months.
Oh, come on, that is a delaying tactic, Del.
You know this is untrue, Wendell.
You've been replanting my seeds.
With the herbicide you were using,
you would have killed off everything except our plants.
You know that.
Excuse me, don't talk to my client, sir.
No, let them talk.
No, Del,
please instruct Mr. Pratt this is not a free-for-all.
No. I agree--
it's time for the two of them to talk it out.
Wendell, I know you don't live with your head in the sand.
You're a good man.
A good steward of the earth.
Just tell the truth.
Wendell, shall we take a break?
No.
I've been replanting your seeds.
I know it's against the law,
but it's a rotten law.
I had no choice.
Your seeds were taking over my land.
You control over 90% of the market, Ed.
You control the food.
When you control the food,
you control the people.
I'm sorry, Del.
I lied earlier.
I knew what I was doing.
I lied before God.
And I'm sorry.
Thank you, Wendell. Thank you for sharing that.
Del.
We thank Wendell for his honesty.
But, again: that makes this case simpler.
Yes, it does.
Wendell, since you've admitted to the infringement,
I have no choice but to find...
Del, excuse me.
I submit the admission is moot.
What?
He just...
Why?
There can be no infringement because...
the patenting of life is an affront to God.
Are you kidding me?
They're messing with nature. The Bible says
God's creation is good.
What about weeds? Are weeds good?
Because our client knows how to get rid of weeds,
and your client likes that.
Our client has spent $400 million
on R&D for a product that is feeding the world.
Dean, they own one gene.
No, what's ridiculous is Mrs. Florrick not being able to...
What's ridiculous is that you don't allow me to finish questioning...
Look, I'll-I'll pay you for the seeds I used,
and I guess I'm your customer.
But I'd appreciate a discount.
I think that's a good idea.
They own one gene in one seed. They don't own the plant.
They don't own the sun.
"Render unto Caesar
What is Caesar's and unto God God's...
what is God's."
Now you're just quoting random Bible verses.
Are you good?
Yeah. You?
Thanks.
We settled it.
Who is that, Mrs. Wagner?
The man you're kissing.
It's not your husband, is it? It's not Trey?
Was that a no, Ma'am?
That was a no.
Thank you.
We were able to I.D. him as Ellison McFarlane.
Is he your boyfriend, Mrs. Wagner?
Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.
Your Honor, Mr. McFarlane's rap sheet is extensive.
Assault and battery, armed robbery, possession.
He is a dangerous man, with whom Mrs. Wagner has been carrying on
an affair for over a year.
She wanted a new life. She wanted Trey gone.
That's not true.
Objection, Your Honor.
This is pure conjecture with no basis in fact.
Yep, you're right, Mr. Polmar.
Then again, I'm not sure how much fact you've got either.
I will rule tomorrow. In the meantime, Mr. Agos,
try showing up on time, and stay close to home.
Next.
So no money?
Yep.
Well, at least they're friends.
Good working with you.
You, too.
Do you still believe in God?
Do I? Yeah.
You?
No.
I don't think I'm genetically built to believe in God.
I didn't think I was either.
Until I was.
Alicia, do you have a minute?
Talk to you later, Alicia.
Who's that?
A new partner. I was just heading home, Eli.
This will only take a minute.
Peter needs to endorse tomorrow for State's Attorney,
and I'm putting together a list of the top contenders.
I can't put your name on that list, is that right?
That's right.
Do you have any other suggestions?
Harold Lutz.
No, we asked him.
Diane Lockhart.
Same. She said no.
Well, who else is Peter considering?
There was only one name.
Well, I'm not running.
I know.
He knows. That's not the name.
It's not? What-What's the name?
James Castro.
Oh, come on, Eli.
He's not endorsing...
Castro is a bad man.
Yes,
and Peter will grit his teeth and do it.
James Castro's the only one who can win,
and Peter needs to back a winner.
Nice try.
What?
Trying to psych me into saying yes.
No, Alicia, not everything is about you.
Peter is endorsing Castro.
He is a bad man, but sometimes the world needs bad men.
Unless you have another name.
No.
You.
Okay, thanks.
If I think of another name, I'll let you know.
Yeah. By tomorrow. Peter needs to endorse tomorrow.
Otherwise it looks like he's following the crowd.
Alicia,
I'm tired. I need you to take over for me.
...never say such a thing. I don't know why he'd say that.
I never heard him say such a thing.
No, I-I did...
I have to go.
Did you have any questions, Ms. Grubick?
Yes.
Let me see.
As I said, I'm Cary Agos' pretrial services officer,
and I just had a few questions for you as his lawyer
before I submitted my report to the court.
That is why I'm here.
I understand you fired Mr. Agos a year ago.
Yes, at his old firm. My old firm.
And, actually, that wasn't the first time you fired him, was it?
No. Once before.
So... how secure is his job right now?
Very.
My job is less secure than his.
But it's my understanding he's lost many of his clients.
Well, some of his clients.
And that has not become an issue?
That's the issue. I have to impress clients.
You don't.
Whose name's on the letterhead?
Okay, wait, wait.
No, no issue at all.
And there's no tension between Cary and his coworkers?
Three years ago
I could have had my name on the letterhead.
Cary, let's just listen, okay?
All right, we need to expand.
I mean, this is a charming space, but our clients are used to more.
Your clients?
I only say "Our clients" because they're more in danger
of leaving for Lockhart/Gardner.
So what do we do? We have nowhere to go.
Uh, the floor above us has just become available,
so I propose we-we build up.
Hmm, it is my understanding that Mr. Agos' bond
has come from his workplace, your workplace.
That is true.
It's a lot of money.
Is there any chance the bond would be rescinded
due to financial issues or any other reasons?
Can we afford it? The second floor?
Well, Dean and I talked,
and we would be willing to finance the first year's rent
via a personal loan to the firm.
Really?
In exchange for the loan, uh,
we would like an executive committee
comprised of three partners from Florrick-Agos
and three partners from Lockhart/Gardner.
No, the bond is secure.
Okay.
Is there anything else you want to tell me?
No.
All right, then.
Thank you.
This has not been an easy decision.
On the one hand, the defense has presented a reasonable
alternate theory to Trey Wagner's disappearance,
but they haven't backed it up with evidence.
The prosecution, meanwhile, has a great deal of evidence,
but nothing that leads one
directly to the conclusion that they would like.
I am left with a tie.
So I've asked the defendant's pretrial services officer to weigh in,
and I'd like her recommendation on the record.
Oh, God. I'm screwed.
Do you have a recommendation for the court?
I do.
Please.
In my sessions with Mr. Agos and, uh, collateral witnesses,
I saw a man who is terrified of going back to jail.
He was a deputy state's attorney,
and, uh, there are prisoners inside who he put there,
so that makes him a flight risk.
Uh... but I also saw a man
who is fighting for his business,
determined to get his life back.
It is my opinion he knew enough of the risks to not intimidate
or order the intimidation of any witness.
I have concluded that Mr. Agos
has not broken any of the conditions of his bond.
Thank you, Mrs. Grubick.
You may step down. So there you have it.
Mr. Agos, you will remain free on bail.
Next.
You have something to say to me?
No.
I doubt that. Men always have something to say.
No. After I put your partner away for 15 years,
then I'll have something to say.
If you're still in office.
Oh, so... that's why you're running,
to get your partner off the hook.
Or so you can keep your client,
Lemond Bishop, out of jail.
Or because your lover was gunned down in one of my courts.
That's the rumor, anyway.
Will Gardner was your lover.
You blame me for his death,
and that's why you're running.
Retribution.
Anything else?
What do you want?
No.
Get it all off your chest.
Oh, I have a lot on my chest.
I'll save it for the campaign.
Talk to you.
Alicia.
How are you?
If I ran... what's the plan?
