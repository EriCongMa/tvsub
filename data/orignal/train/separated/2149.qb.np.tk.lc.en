a fortune teller .
let &apos;s go in .
no .
seriously ?
come on , don &apos;t you want to know what the future holds ?
not really .
okay , well , i do .
come on .
the fool ?
that can &apos;t be good .
not bad , not good .
it just is .
okay .
you have eternal optimism for romance .
your heart is broken .
sounds about right .
and yet ,
you have difficulty maintaining
emotional balance in a relationship .
okay , two for two .
that &apos;s just spooky .
this is because you seek out unavailable ,
immature partners .
heard that .
partners with wandering hearts .
what ? i &apos;m mature .
shall i continue ?
yeah .
what ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
the death card .
that &apos;s mature .
what ?
okay , so , what ?
it represents some sort of an ending
or , uh , metaphorical death ?
it represents death .
esmerelda sense that
death is closing in on you .
so ...
i &apos;m ... gonna die ?
look , is this some sort of a joke or something ?
because it &apos;s really not funny .
death is closing in .
soon , you will feel his touch .
look how beautiful you are .
such a handsome boy .
yeah .
how &apos;s your girth , huh ?
one more .
okay .
handsome boy .
yes , you are .
all right .
i think you &apos;re good .
shh , you &apos;re okay .
it &apos;s okay . what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m death
and i &apos;ve come to touch you with my icy fingers .
you idiot .
couldn &apos;t resist .
yeah , well , you almost gave me a heart attack .
it &apos;s okay .
go give him a hard time out there for me , okay ?
you deserve that .
mmm , what are you doing ?
nothing .
go back to sleep .
there &apos;s something downstairs .
no , no , there isn &apos;t . come back to ...
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
there &apos;s somebody downstairs .
which is why you &apos;re gonna stay up here where it &apos;s safe .
don &apos;t be a caveman .
i &apos;m coming with you .
no , you &apos;re not .
then you &apos;re coming with me .
hey , cath ... hey , listen to me , hey .
hey , hey , hey , come here .
don &apos;t move !
mom ?
hi , honey .

uh , making eggs .
no , i mean , what are you doing here ?
stop playing with your gun and come have breakfast .
do you want orange juice ?
good morning , lieutenant rollins .
i , uh ,
hope i wasn &apos;t interrupting anything .
i told you it was safer upstairs .
i was just ... i @-@ i should really ...
no , no , no , no , you should join us , absolutely .
it &apos;s no trouble at all . how do you like your eggs ?
how do you like your eggs ?
oh , no , no , you two
want to catch up , and i really
have to run , so ...
briefing at the base .
aww . that &apos;s too bad . another time then ?
absolutely .
great . see ya .
okay .
ooh , i like her .
okay , mom ?
mom !
come on , sit down .
mom .
come on .
mom , i don &apos;t want breakfast .
you know , your security system sucks .
okay , you know what , stop . okay ?
what are you doing here ?
i never left the island ,
but i think you already knew that .
yeah , you persuaded witsec to turn the plane around .
i can be very persuasive .
i remember , mom . why &apos;d you do it ?
i wanted to come home .
tired of running .
okay , where have you been for the last few weeks ?
i just needed some time .
i @-@ i wasn &apos;t sure how you &apos;d take this .
well , you should &apos;ve told me what the plan was .
sure , sure , you never would have agreed to it .
no , i probably wouldn &apos;t have agreed to it .
see ?
w @-@ what is this ?
what are these bags ? you &apos;re staying ?
yeah , is that okay with you ?
mom ...
what ?
wo fat is still out there . okay ?
i don &apos;t think this is the safest place
for you to be right now .
you &apos;re worrying too much , you know that ?
you should get that .
mcgarrett .
got it .
so what , she breaks into your house and just starts cooking ?
yeah , pretty much .
that &apos;s very strange .
although , she is a mcgarrett after all .
why &apos;d she come back ?
i don &apos;t know , danny , she says she &apos;s tired of running .
now she &apos;s tired of running , after all these years ?
what happened in the house with wo fat ?
we didn &apos;t get that far .
how could you not get that far ?
steve , this is a man who &apos;s been chasing her for 20 years .
she &apos;s got a shot to get him and she doesn &apos;t take it ?
that doesn &apos;t seem weird to you ?
all silence .
that &apos;s good . both of you .
apple doesn &apos;t fall too far from the tree .
hey , guys .
so , the victim &apos;s name is billy keats .
he was the star player of the diamond head polo club .
i never knew they had polo on this island ?
five clubs .
why , you a polo fan ?
absolutely , it is the sport of kings .
it fits me , doesn &apos;t it ?
diamond head club &apos;s owned by spencer madsen .
the , uh , the billionaire mogul guy ?
one and the same .
all these stables , practice fields ,
all part of the madsen estate .
yeah , that &apos;s why keats was up here .
hey , there &apos;s something you should know before you ...
that &apos;s the something .
seriously , i mean , a headless horseman ? come on .
yeah , so , about that : according to the victim &apos;s girlfriend ,
keats rode off to the practice field this morning
with his head attached .
about half an hour later , the horse returned to the stables ,
dragging the body , minus the head .
just got a text from max .
he found the head .
max .
oh , gentlemen .
allow me to introduce you to mr. keats .
yeah , we just met the rest of him .
okay , we got any idea what did this yet , max ?
some kind of sword ?
that is unlikely .
if you note the precision of the cut
as well as the fact that the instrument in question
was wielded high in the air .
high enough , to reach our victim
while he was straddling a horse .
ah , so what did it ?
well , i believe i have the answer
if you allow me to test my hypothesis .
test , please .
as you can see , the trail of blood indicates the trajectory
the victim &apos;s head took after being severed .
working backwards ,
we can determine that it was at this location
where the final blow was struck .
all right , we got a boot print right here .
can we get a cast ?
okay , so , uh , so , what &apos;s your theory , max ?
what the hell is that ?
this is garroting wire .
the placement of which took into account the victim &apos;s height ,
as well as his daily schedule .
okay , so this is personal .
whoever strung this wire and killed billy keats ,
was trying to make a statement .
message delivered .
loud and clear .
i &apos;d really thought we &apos;d be together forever .
were you and billy engaged ?
not exactly .
he wasn &apos;t ready and neither was i.
maybe i was .
he just needed some time , you know ?
we only knew each other a few months .
billy came to play for the diamond head club mid @-@ season .
he started on a different team .
the island blue club .
nicole carr , this is steve mcgarrett
and danny williams . they &apos;re both five @-@ o.
nicole was billy &apos;s girlfriend .
we &apos;re , uh , very sorry for your loss .
i still can &apos;t believe he &apos;s gone .
just yesterday we were ...
the psychic .
she predicted this .
you saw a psychic that predicted billy would be decapitated ?
she said that i &apos;d be touched by death
and i thought that she meant i was gonna die
but she meant billy .
she meant that i would be touched by his death .
okay , when was this ?
yesterday .
in chinatown .
you think the psychic knew more than she was saying ?
yeah , well , if she did ,
i doubt her intel came from a crystal ball .
best case scenario : she is psychic
and she can just tell us who murdered billy keats .
and where the hell i put my keys .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s just a con .
yeah , but you know what ?
cons are observant ,
so she might &apos;ve noticed something out of the ordinary .
uh , like somebody following them or strange behavior .
all right .
go ahead and check out the psychic .
i &apos;m gonna see what i can dig up on keats .
come in , come in .
madame esmerelda can feel your bond .
this relationship is very strong ,
and it will yield many children .
us ?
no . no , we , uh ...
no .
no , i don &apos;t think that that &apos;s gonna ever happen .
no , um , not that you have any reason to sense this ,
but we &apos;re not here for a reading .
please , sit down .
uh , we actually would like to know about a reading
that you gave billy keats and nicole carr .
i see many people every day .
i understand , um , but do you tell all of them
that they &apos;re gonna be touched by death ?
okay , let &apos;s ...
let &apos;s just drop the act .
we both know enough about interrogation technique
to know that all you do
is manipulate people into offering information about themselves
that you feed back to them .
esmerelda also knows a thing or two .
first thing is you can &apos;t force me to talk to you .
that &apos;s not what ... we don &apos;t want to force you to do anything .
uh , we are here for your help .
uh , billy keats was murdered this morning
and we thought maybe you could use your gift to help ,
uh , bring his killer to justice .
you want esmerelda to talk ,
you pay for a reading .
how much ?
50 bucks .
pay her .
why do i have to pay her ?
because you make more money than i do .
30,40 ...
here .
the boy got a phone call during the reading .
he didn &apos;t answer it ,
but , uh , it made him nervous .
i could see the caller id .
it was from someone named al .
that &apos;s actually very impressive .
okay , what else ?
after the reading , the boy stayed back .
he told the girl he needed to pay ,
but i knew he want to ask a question .
i told him
i knew he had secrets .
i told him he can ask me anything .
and did he ?
yes .
he asked me one question :
&quot; does he know ? &quot;
does who know what ?
the universe hasn &apos;t shared the answer with me .
whatever it was ,
i sense it contributed to his death .
morning , mrs. mcgarrett .
doris , please , call me doris .
you &apos;re chin ho kelly , right ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
well , come on in .
thanks .
i &apos;ve actually seen you play football .
really ?
yeah , steve used to make me drive him
to your games , so he could study your footwork .
ah , you &apos;re the one to blame for him breaking all my records .
well , i was just the chauffeur .
well , i hope you don &apos;t mind ,
but steve asked me to bring you by some breakfast .
oh , how nice .
except , um , the thing is i &apos;ve already made breakfast
and steve knows that , so i really hope
you &apos;re a better cop than you are a liar .
excuse me ?
coco puffs from liliha bakery .
ah , that is really good work .
i mean , appealing to my nostalgic side and everything ,
well , i &apos;m sure steve told you that i used to
bring these every sunday morning to him and his sister .
but if there &apos;s one thing
i learned at the cia
about using a diversionary technique , it &apos;s , um ,
avoid the obvious .
they &apos;re just coco puffs .
they &apos;re still really delicious .
they &apos;re even better with a cup of coffee .
okay .
you can tell my son that whether or not he cares
to acknowledge it , i &apos;ve been taking care of myself
since before he was born
and i &apos;m actually pretty damn good at it .
so , you can stay here and have that cup of coffee ,
talk kukui high football ,
if you want that , i &apos;m game .
but if you &apos;re here just to babysit me ,
you can leave right now .
but the coco puffs stay with me .
i &apos;ll take my coffee black .
good choice .
i am not saying that madame esmerelda was ,
in fact , the real deal .
there are obviously bad apples in the bunch .
okay , stop , seriously .
you , danny williams , believe in psychics ?
hey , listen , all i know is that when i was a cop
back in new jersey , there was a lady
and she definitely had something .
uh , a gift .
a gift .
don &apos;t mock me . you gonna mock me ?
i know what i know , okay ?
we were , there was this girl in hoboken .
she went missing , she &apos;s seven years old .
we got no evidence .
we got no leads , we got nothing .
this lady , she comes in .
she lights a candle ,
she starts touching the girl &apos;s clothes ,
and then out of nowhere , all of a sudden ,
she takes us right to the kid .
it was amazing .
you sure she wasn &apos;t in on it ?
it ... what are you , impugning my investigative skills ?
we @-@ we cleared her obviously .
she had a gift .
okay , so let me get this straight ,
you do believe in psychics , but you don &apos;t believe in ghosts .
that &apos;s correct .
oh , that makes sense .
totally .
what can i say ? i &apos;m complicated .
exectly .
hey , guys .
so , i pulled billy keats &apos; financials .
turns out , his former team was still paying him .
okay , wait , his girlfriend said he left
that team a few months ago .
right .
and not only was the general manager keeping him
on the payroll , he actually upped what he was paying him .
hold on .
who quits their job and gets a raise ?
very good question .
the general manager &apos;s a guy named al reingold .
al . al !
the , uh , the psychic said
that billy ignored a call from a guy named al
and it made him nervous .
yeah , well , that would make sense if billy
was taking hush money from al .
hush money ? for what ?
horse doping .
i like it , it &apos;s a good theory .
where did it come from ?
all right , since billy keats left al mid @-@ season
and for a rival team ,
i figured that al wasn &apos;t paying him out of a goodwill gesture .
so , i looked into who else was on al &apos;s payroll
and i found the name of a veterinarian from the mainland .
this guy was busted for supplying racehorse owners
with a performance @-@ enhancing drug called demorphin .
so , you think he supplied al with the same stuff
for his polo ponies ?
well , i mean , the guy was based in nevada .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s gonna be making house calls to honolulu .
okay , so , uh , al ,
he gets tired of being extorted ,
maybe he decides to wipe billy off the books for good .
welcome to the male match of the hawaii polo club .
hey , al reingold ?
yeah ?
what do you got in the bag ?
al , we already have you on the horse doping .
why not just do we a favor and cover to the rest .
there isn &apos;t anything else .
why are you lying ?
i hate it when suspects lie .
i already gave you an alibi , man .
i was at that horse auction , you gotta look into it .
but you have motive .
plus , we got your financial records .
billy keats was on to you
and you were tired of paying him off to keep quiet .
okay , look , b @-@ billy found out about the drugs ,
but he wasn &apos;t gonna rat me out .
he was happy taking the money .
i didn &apos;t kill him , i swear .
we &apos;ll see about that .
kono .
yes .
we got something ?
yeah , so forensics came back on the boot print you found at the scene .
there was a logo on the sole : some kind of a crest .
did you track down the manufacturer ?
yep .
okay , good , please , tell me that you can trace it back to al .
uh , hate to be a buzzkill ,
but the boots were custom made for spencer madsen &apos;s team ,
not al &apos;s .
the diamond head club .
right , and sorry again , danny ,
but al reingold &apos;s alibi checks .
he was at the horse auction on molokai .
he was placing bids all weekend
and only got back in to honolulu about an hour
before you guys tracked him down .
you know , i really , really wanted
al to spend the rest of his life in prison .
son of a bitch almost got me trampled to death
while a bunch of one percenters sipped champagne and cheered .
kono , we gotta track down everybody with a pair of those boots .
i worked closely with the designer on these .
the crest on the sole was my idea .
my wife has always been a polo fan .
it &apos;s why spencer bought the diamond head club .
i still can &apos;t believe it ,
billy was such a strong rider .
it &apos;s just awful .
how can we help ?
we &apos;re gonna need a list of
everybody with a pair of these boots .
that &apos;s a long list .
all the players have them , of course ,
but we also give them as gifts .
so , there have to be what , amanda ?
a few hundred pair floating around the island ?
at least .
what about video surveillance ?
you must have security .
absolutely . there &apos;s nothing up on the practice field ,
but there are cameras at every gate .
whoever hung up that garroting wire
had to have done it after the team practice last night
and before billy rode in this morning ,
so something maybe on film ?
yeah , i &apos;d like officer kalakaua to go over that footage .
of course , i &apos;ll call our head of security and make arrangements .
great .
dad , what &apos;s going on ?
i heard billy was killed in an accident .
is it true ?
it &apos;s true , jake .
but these folks were just telling us that it ...
it &apos;s not an accident .
jake , these are investigators from five @-@ o.
they &apos;re looking into billy &apos;s murder .
murder ?
what happened ?
billy was up on the practice field and he ...
he rode into a garroting wire .
what ?
jake , billy &apos;s been decapitated .
oh , my god .
the wire was strung between the goalposts .
someone targeted him .
it &apos;s not him . me .
jake , what are you talking about ?
it was supposed to be me out there this morning .
billy and i traded practice times .
chin , what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re supposed to be on doris detail .
your mom saw me coming a mile away .
why are we whispering ?
coco puffs ?
really , steve ?
i thought you were smarter than that .
don &apos;t blame chin .
i forced him to bring me down here .
she &apos;s very persuasive .
i know .
what do i have to do to get you to listen to reason ?
if by reason , you mean you &apos;re going to stop treating me like a child ,
then , nothing . i &apos;m all ears .
mom .
no , steve , seriously .
what &apos;s your long @-@ term plan ?
you gonna drag me to work with you every day ?
she has a point there .
my office , now .
you got a better plan ?
yeah , my plan is to go home , alone ,
unpack and settle in , okay ?
i just want to live my life , all right ?
i just want to , i want to find a place of my own
and get on with things .
you think wo fat &apos;s just gonna let that happen ?
you don &apos;t even know if he &apos;s still on the island , steve .
and i told you , i am done running .
i am done .
okay ?
he comes after me again , i &apos;ll handle it .
really , mom ?
yeah .
i can handle it , steve .
i &apos;ve already given him too much of my life .
okay .
okay .
all right .
i &apos;ll have chin give you a ride home .
chin &apos;s working . i &apos;ll grab a cab .
later , chin .
latahs .
she tell you why she let wo fat go ?
no , not yet .
what do you got ?
some info on jake madsen that might help us
figure out who &apos;d want him dead .
turns out jake was kidnapped ten years ago .
it was actually a big case at the time .
hpd worked it along with the fbi .
he was abducted outside of his school ,
and the kidnappers held him for almost two weeks .
they cut off his finger and mailed it back to his parents
as proof of life
along with a ransom demand of $ 20 million .
did the madsens make the trade ?
didn &apos;t have the chance .
jake actually escaped before the ransom was paid .
brave kid .
yeah .
and after the kidnappers were arrested ,
it was jake &apos;s testimony that convicted them .
well , life must &apos;ve been hard for him after that--
always looking over his shoulder to see
if somebody else was coming for him .
not to mention he was marked for life .
that &apos;s a lot for a kid to grow up with .
sad case .
what about the kidnappers , chin ?
let &apos;s find out .
all right , looks like one of &apos; em died in prison ,
and the other one , randy thorpe ,
was released from halawa a couple of months ago .
and get this ,
he went awol from his halfway house two days ago .
what &apos;s up , boss ?
kono , where are you ?
leaving the madsen estate . the field trip was a bust .
didn &apos;t get anything from the surveillance footage .
okay , kono , listen ,
i need you to turn around and
go back to that house immediately .
boss , what &apos;s going on ?
i need you to put jake madsen in protective custody right away .
one of his former kidnappers is on the loose ,
and it looks like he &apos;s out for revenge .
amanda was right there by the blast .
she &apos;s in critical condition .
what about jake ?
he was conscious when the paramedics took him .
he should be released pretty quick .
and what kind of protection does he have ?
oh , i sent three units with him .
danny , track down that kidnapper , randy thorpe .
he struck out twice .
last thing we need is another attempt .
all right .
what do you got , fong ?
won &apos;t know for sure
until i get back to the lab ,
but we found three cell phones on scene .
the first two belong to amanda and jake .
and you &apos;re thinking the third was a trigger ?
that &apos;s the theory .
all right , what about the explosive device ?
i &apos;ve got fragments ,
but it might take some time to get these analyzed .
do you mind ? i think i might know somebody who can help .
thanks .
aloha .
hey .
how you doing ?
good .
how &apos;s everything going with your mom ?
you know , doris is being doris-- stubborn .
yeah , reminds me of somebody i know .
low blow .
i don &apos;t know , but something tells me
that you didn &apos;t ask me here to talk about your mom .
what is that supposed to mean ?
it means well , let &apos;s see , it &apos;s , uh ,
too early for dinner and it &apos;s too late for lunch ,
so you must have a favor to ask me .
go ahead , deny it to my face . deny it .
listen . seriously , this is important .
um , i need to know what kind of explosive device this is ,
and i don &apos;t have time to wait for the lab to turn it around .
yeah , i can probably have someone take a look at it ,
but , um ... it &apos;s gonna cost you .
okay , i knew that was coming .
okay , so , see that truck right there ?
yeah .
you can order anything you want from that truck .
no .
anything .
really ?
yeah , like , sky &apos;s the limit .
thank you , sugar daddy .
you got it .
can you hold that thought for a second ?
danny .
got a hit on our suspect randy thorpe &apos;s credit card .
he just used it to check in to the paradise motel ,
which , by the way , looks nothing at all like paradise .
why ? you got eyes on the place ?
yeah . as we speak .
all right , good . i &apos;m on my way .
you &apos;re welcome .
hey ! five @-@ o ! don &apos;t move !
no , no ! i don &apos;t ...
think that that is a good idea .
why do i bother ?
steve , where you going ? he &apos;s over here .
can i get a hand here ?
not one of mine , you can &apos;t .
he &apos;s riding back in your car , okay ?
you know that water &apos;s polluted , right ?
hey . if i &apos;d jumped in ,
you &apos;d be giving two tetanus shots , okay ?
why do we both have to suffer ?
oh , whoa , whoa . what are you doing ?
can you please just put it in your arm like a normal human ?
you know what ? you &apos;re such a girl , you know that ?
just turn around or something . cover your eyes .
you can insult me all you like ,
but i am not the one who took a header in the ala wai canal .
that was you .
hey , how you going downstairs with randy ?
the &quot; good cop &quot; routine is not working .
really ?
&quot; bad cop &quot; it is .
i don &apos;t got to talk to you .
shut up .
the game is ...
you get to guess what i think about people
who cut fingers off little kids , you ...
he thinks that really bad things
just happen to them , and i agree ,
so if something bad should happen in here ,
i &apos;m gonna be forced to say that you got crazy
and had to be subdued .
you can &apos;t do that .
okay . look ...
i planted a bomb for 50 grand .
what do you mean ?
what do you mean &quot; planted &quot; ? somebody hired you ? who ?
i don &apos;t know .
i swear .
whole thing was arranged online-- e @-@ mails .
i got 50 grand wired into my account .
fact is ...
i &apos;d have done it for free
just to get back at that little creep .
little creep ?
th @-@ the child ...
the child that you abducted and mutilated ?
he &apos;s sick .
all these years ,
only thing i wished i did different was kill him ,
instead of just cutting off his finger .
book him , danno .
attempted murder .
wow , i &apos;m impressed by the turnaround .
what can i say , i aim to please .
i owe you .
yes , you do .
so , the device was made of composition c @-@ 4 plastic explosive .
it &apos;s not terribly sophisticated .
sophisticated enough to kill .
our kidnapper randy &apos;s story checks out .
i got e @-@ mails and a wire transfer .
still don &apos;t know who hired him to plant the bomb , though .
okay . uh , catherine has something she wants us to see .
this is a forensic recreation of the point of detonation
and the blast trajectory .
wait a minute , according to that ,
the device was planted in the passenger @-@ side door .
so , what , randy screwed up ?
no , in the e @-@ mails he was specifically instructed
to put it there .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
well , it does if amanda madsen was the target
instead of her son .
why would ... she be the target ?
who would want her dead ?
thanks to fong , we may have the answer to that question .
turns out the third cell phone he found at the scene
wasn &apos;t a trigger device after all .
it was a burner phone , and it belonged to amanda madsen .
there was only one phone number programmed into it ,
and , uh , the texting back and forth was , shall we say , intimate .
amanda madsen was having an affair with who ?
that &apos;s the kicker .
she was having an affair with the headless horseman ?
looks like it .
okay , well , this changes pretty much everything .
uh , the two people with motive in this now
are billy &apos;s girlfriend and amanda &apos;s husband .
figure out who knew about the affair , we find the killer .
according to the hospital , amanda madsen &apos;s
in stable condition and taking visitors .
call ahead to the hospital , have them put a uni on the door .
steve , something &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s amanda &apos;s room .
she &apos;s dead .
kono just said she was stable .
she was .
she &apos;s got petechial hemorrhaging .
somebody smothered her .
thank you though .
danny , what do you got ?
got bad news .
visitors are not required to check in here at the nurses &apos; station ,
and the uni obviously didn &apos;t make it to the room before the code blue .
okay , stop right there .
go back .
you got a camera at the end of the hall ?
zoom in-- camera two .
rewind .
freeze right there .
freeze on that .
that &apos;s not spencer ; that &apos;s jake .
he didn &apos;t stay long .
long enough to kill his mother .
i know about my wife .
the hospital called .
did you know that your son smothered her ?
we need to talk to jake .
mr. madsen , where is he ?
it wasn &apos;t jake .
yes , it was .
we saw him at the hospital , he was caught on camera .
this is all my fault .
he was so angry .
what are you talking about ?
angry about what , the affair ?
yeah .
no .
about my reaction to it .
you knew that billy keats was having an affair with your wife ?
i knew .
i loved amanda , but she hadn &apos;t loved me for a very long time
if she ever did .
jake was upset ...
... that i didn &apos;t do anything about the affair .
he thought i was weak like when he was a boy .
what , what are you talking about ?
the kidnapping .
we know about the kidnapping .
no , you don &apos;t-- you think you do .
even the fbi didn &apos;t know .
they thought the first demand
for ransom came after those monsters sent proof of life ,
but it didn &apos;t .
the first demand came the day after jake was abducted .
they wanted $ 20 million .
i wanted to pay it , amanda convinced me not to .
your wife didn &apos;t want to pay to get her son back ?
she said , if we gave in to their demands ,
we &apos;d all be sitting ducks for the rest of our lives .
so you didn &apos;t pay the ransom ,
and they cut his finger off .
did jake know about this ?
the kidnappers told him .
he was only ten years old .
we were supposed to ... protect him ,
but he knew that i ...
couldn &apos;t stand up to his mother ,
and he knew she was incapable of putting him first .
so he took care of himself .
right ?
he got away , he testified against the men who took him .
he was only ten years old .
when he found out about the affair ,
he asked me to ... ... divorce amanda ,
and i told him i wouldn &apos;t .
you have to understand .
he was so angry .
you have to understand that you cannot protect him anymore ,
and he killed two people .
it &apos;s all my fault .
jake .
five @-@ o.
we need to talk to you .
come on down .
jake madsen ,
you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of billy keats and amanda madsen .

he didn &apos;t want to , jake .
but he did .
he knows everything ?
yeah , he knows and he blames himself .
