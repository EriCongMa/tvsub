it &apos;s more comforting that way .

you &apos;re coming back ?
i hope so . immigration , they make problems .
maybe tony can help with that .
yeah .
what are you doing here ? i thought you were flying out to naples .
i just dropped off these shirts from patsy &apos;s guy .
but you should be on your way to see your old man .
cancer is everywhere in his body . cancer don &apos;t respect nothing .
you know , it started in his guts .
do you need any money ?
i &apos;m good .
please call and let us know .
i &apos;m sorry , tony .
you &apos;ll have to get somebody else to drive you tonight .
not a problem . go .
you think he wears a bag ?
who wears what ?
you know , a colostomy bag .
furio &apos;s old man .
how the fuck would i know that ?
because my ma ,
maybe , maybe not , has to get one .
could we not talk about this ?
we could talk about any topic you like , t.
good .
it &apos;s just that now with ma all squared away to go to green grove ...
for fuck &apos;s sake , paulie , everybody &apos;s gonna get old and die .
am i driving you tomorrow , too ?
no , i &apos;ll drive myself .
i got nothing else to do .
i got a very important meeting , that &apos;s all .
it &apos;s a delicate situation .
we lucked out with the weather .
so , how &apos;s the life of leisure ?
playing golf , ain &apos;t i ?
cocksucker .
seriously , it &apos;s good you &apos;re pulling back business @-@ wise like we agreed .
my nephew , i told him . i &apos;m gonna be speaking through him ,
and only through him , as time passes .
good .
plus sil .
i don &apos;t want to celebrate my daughter &apos;s first kid in prison .
all right , this sit @-@ down in perth amboy . get a pen and paper .
hold on .
i can &apos;t find a piece of paper .
shoot .
tell paulie to
let patsy run the car operation while furio &apos;s gone .
tell patsy he &apos;s got to kick up 10 points .
seven and a half to me , two and half to paulie .

you and sil , you figure out who pays the longshore union how much .
i &apos;ll back you up whichever .
what the fuck ?
i &apos;m on it .
all right .
a simple yes or no will do .
please .
artie , hi , how are things ?
fine .
did they ever catch those muggers ?
did you leave room for dessert ?
we &apos;ll have one zabaglione and four spoons . coffees , all around .
bri &apos; , can i ask you a financial @-@ related question ?
the last thing the guy wants to do is talk shop .
ask him anything you want . it &apos;s all he likes to talk about .
it &apos;s no big thing . any ideas on what tony and i should do ...
with the proceeds from the property in newark we sold ?
a hud ?
what ?
kid loves paul newman movies . no more grappa for you .
you know what i &apos;m talking about . uncle junior &apos;s lot on frelinghuysen avenue .
yeah , that . it all went into the trust .
t @-@ bills , i was able to lock you in before the rates dropped .
what doesn &apos;t this kid know about money ?
you know , i trust him 1,000 percent ?
thank you .
we have so many more of the newborn size .
i think they &apos;re cheaper .
next year we could put a notice in the bulletin ...
that people whose last names begin with &quot; a &quot; to &quot; k &quot; bring the newborns ...
and &quot; l &quot; to &quot; z &quot; bring the bigger ones , or vice versa .
whatever we give them , the girls at our ladies &apos; shelter should be grateful .
i mean , nobody told them to go and have babies without husbands .
i remember his charity toward my family when jack died .
i didn &apos;t know how to pay the phone bill . jackie always did everything .
there you go .
thank you .
i pay bills ... but other than that , it &apos;s the same with tony .
try to find out where the money is ... how much we have ,
and i get such resistance .
i didn &apos;t know what we had until after i buried jackie .
was it enough ?
sort of .
not really .
how much is enough , anyway ?
i don &apos;t know , that &apos;s my point . doesn &apos;t anything ever change ?
women are supposed to be partners nowadays .
i &apos;m not a feminist , i &apos;m not saying 50 @-@ 50 , but jesus .
you know , i put up with cumare shit . pardon my french .
i made my peace with it , best i could , anyway .
isn &apos;t your cousin brian handling your money now ?
the big things , the investments . he &apos;s doing well , too .
you know , i do have to give tony credit there .
he did meet me halfway with that , god bless him .
which was a very big step for him , i know .
maybe you have nothing to worry about . - i don &apos;t know .
tony pulls people into his circle . i don &apos;t know what to think .
good girl .
titanium ?
the track &apos;s freezing up , it &apos;s too hard for aluminum .
whatever she &apos;s got on those feet , she &apos;s a winner .
a little colicky ?
you don &apos;t feel good , baby girl ? you bad girl .
fuck this horse @-@ whispering shit .
what is this costing us ? tony , valentina .
she works in an art gallery . helping me to enlarge my collection .
and this , my chiquita banana , is pie @-@ o @-@ my .
she &apos;s beautiful .
there &apos;s no stopping this horse . she &apos;s gonna go all the way to the breeders &apos; .
we &apos;ll do the two geldings next .
hon , can you come here a sec ? i think i have something in my eye .
let dr. ralphie have a look .
i don &apos;t see anything .
maybe you need more light .
what the fuck ?
i can &apos;t believe you did this to me .
it was a joke , hon .
there &apos;s nothing funny about it .
there is from where i &apos;m standing .
besides , it &apos;s good luck .
what ?
it &apos;s good luck to step in horseshit .
ask any horse person .
it &apos;s true .
then why aren &apos;t you people walking around ...
iooking for piles of horseshit to stomp around in ?
it only works if it &apos;s an accident .
fucking sick , all of you .
fucko , where &apos;s a hose ?
you know , it can be risky trusting him to have a sense of humor .
did you think it was funny ?
yeah , but what i think is funny is
what an 8 @-@ year @-@ old boy thinks is funny .
having any fun yourself ?
what , you taking a survey ?
have any interest in art ?
show the right thing , i do .
there &apos;s an artist down in new hope , specializes in horses .
give him a photo of your horse , he paints a lovely portrait .
it &apos;d look great in your office .
have a look at my office
before you make that call .
think about it . if you &apos;re interested ,
give me a call .
&quot; la paz . &quot;
what &apos;s that , puerto rican ?
cubana .
my mother was italian , my father cuban
what a dangerous combination .
she gorgeous or what ?
sweet as sugar .
if there &apos;s anything you need , you just press this button .
which one ?
this one that i &apos;m showing you .
safety first .
a friend of yours , mrs. cirillo , might stop by .
she wanted to see you before you went down for lunch .
cookie .
look , just like home . they &apos;re gonna wait on you hand and foot around here .
put the boxes in the closet . and go get the tv .
the both of you carry it .
come on , cowgirl . let &apos;s go down to the chuck wagon
and see what they &apos;re rustling up .
paulie , did they bring my bathmat ?
for the fifth time , ma , yes .
look who &apos;s here to make you feel at home .
are you here , too ?
not yet , but it &apos;s all paid for .
i &apos;m gonna move in after my hip surgery .
minn comes twice a week for lunch , in the meantime .
she &apos;s one of the girls .
look how you &apos;ve grown up , paulie .
i know . i don &apos;t understand .
when i was a kid , you two were old ladies .
now i &apos;m old , and you two are still old .
so , how &apos;s chucky doing , anyway ? still teaching ?
he &apos;s been the high @-@ school principal for the last 10 years or so .
bergen north .
he must give you a lot of happiness .
except for that wife of his .
all you ever been was nice to her .
i know that .
come on , girls , i &apos;ll take you to lunch .
i got to use the wc .
she just went 10 minutes ago .
i don &apos;t want to embarrass your mother in the dining room .
so make sure she knows ... she can &apos;t sit with me
and minn , and our other girls .
what are you talking about ?
we &apos;re a set group .
we eat together , we play scrabble for money ...
and there &apos;s really no room at either table .
come on now , cook . i know you girls can work it out .
fucking amazing .
this is how simple it is to change inputs .
listen to that imaging in stereo mode .
it &apos;s like clapton &apos;s sitting right there at your house .
great , huh ?
we can all watch movies as a family now .
and listen to that .
i think it &apos;s great . i &apos;m going food shopping .
maybe i &apos;ll get in the bedroom .
what time you want me to wake you up ?
the movie .
yeah . good .
have fun .
hello ?
mr. wall , please .
yeah , can you talk ?
yeah , i &apos;m on a hotel phone .
so , how are you ? what &apos;s going on ?
i found him , chuck . i found the man who killed helen .
what ?
it was me they were after .
who are they ?
devlin macgregor and lentz .
lentz was supervising the protocol for rdu @-@ 90 .
he knew i found out it was causing liver damage . it was lentz .
lentz is dead .
what ? how ?
he died in a car accident last summer .
can you prove this about the drug ?
yeah , i think so .
i need your help , chuck . call bones at the hospital .
tell him to give me whatever help i need .
beautiful looking animal .
great definition , carriage .
i &apos;d love to paint her .
good .
but what about this deadbeat ?
there &apos;s no problem cropping you both out .
we could set her in front of the rail at the track as she is .
or if you &apos;d prefer something more pastoral , we can place her in a meadow .
i don &apos;t know about that , but can you leave me in there and just crop him out ?
easy . and frankly , it would be better , composition @-@ wise .
go for the pastoral , much more dignified .
and it comes framed ?
exactly as you see that one .
$ 6,500 .
all right , you got a deal .
to pie @-@ o @-@ mine .
my .
your what ?
no , the name , it &apos;s pie @-@ o @-@ my .
i &apos;ll give you the whole thing now .
there .
i &apos;d better get your receipt . i &apos;ll just be a minute .
let &apos;s not forget to drink to the beautiful senorita ...
whose idea this was in the first place .
i bet you say that to all the girls . - there &apos;s not that many .
and truthfully , the ones that there are ,
they don &apos;t got many ideas .
we should probably start heading back soon .
yeah .
if you want , on the way , we can stop and eat something .
yeah , we could definitely stop .
like that .
so good .
just like that .
yeah , that &apos;s so good .
let me up .
you can see cows from in there .
sit down and eat before it gets any colder .
looks good , doesn &apos;t it ?
mine needed salt .
jesus fucking christ , these fucking hicks can &apos;t even get this right .
you did this ?
that &apos;s very mature .
it &apos;s not funny .
i thought you had an 8 @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s sense of humor .
come here and give me a kiss .
i &apos;m eating .
not anymore , you &apos;re not .
what if i promise to be good ?
how good ?
good .
shit , i lost a nail .
we will not be mentioning anything about any of this to ralph .
i &apos;ll take it . can you send it to this person here ?
sure . you want to include a card with this ?
let me have another one .
round and round she goes , where she stops , nobody knows .
place your bets , be a winner .
i &apos;ll take another card .
are you sure , dear ?
for the love of god , nucci , how could you hit on 18 ?
give me another one .
that should &apos;ve been my card ! i could &apos;ve had 21 .
i was hoping for a three .
i &apos;m not sure you understand the fine points .
maybe you ought to play roulette . it &apos;s right over there .
round and round she goes , where she stops , nobody knows .
goddamn it , tony !
you did that to me on our honeymoon .
i didn &apos;t like it then , and i made you promise me you &apos;d never do it again .
it &apos;s just a little cold water .
it &apos;s really unpleasant .
do you remember promising me ?
you can do it back to me .
i don &apos;t want to do it back to you .
why not ? it &apos;s fun .
do you remember promising me ?
yeah , so what ?
so ... this is one promise i would like you to keep .
whatever .
this can &apos;t be paulie .
chucky ?
come here , you pizza @-@ face @-@ son @-@ of @-@ a @-@ son @-@ of @-@ a @-@ gun you .
oh , god . mr. van kowenberg , what did we say about those shoes ?
the laces are in my locker , i was gonna get them after study hall .
get them now .
come on , paulie .
hard to believe it &apos;s been so long .
this is for you .
that &apos;s a nice gesture , paul , but i really can &apos;t .
go on , i got lots of them .
you can &apos;t insult me .
no more glasses ?
i had the lasik .
and your face cleared up pretty good , too ?
cleared up in 10th grade .
see , there you go . ninth was my last .
so , did your mom tell you i saw her over at green grove ?
apparently , she sees quite a bit of your mother .
that &apos;s just it , chucky . they &apos;re both residents .
but there seems to be an exclusion .
i don &apos;t blame your mother .
i blame that minn matrone . she &apos;s a malignant cunt .
excuse me for saying so .
she eggs your mother on , and she don &apos;t even live there .
i &apos;m not sure i understand .
i &apos;m just asking you to talk to your ma .
see if she can include my ma more with the group .
it won &apos;t do much good . now , you know how these old gals are .
all i &apos;m trying to do is pay my ma back ...
for when i was a kid and got into so much trouble .
she went to bat for me how many times ? with the nuns .
with the store owners up and down 13th street .
and let &apos;s face it , chucky , with the cops .
for all the bad i did .
i &apos;m still capable if i don &apos;t watch myself .
but with all of that , she always had my back .
i &apos;ll talk to my ma , see what she says . but like i said ...
whatever you can do .
all right . take care .
ale was always served in pints and quarts .
so , &quot; mind your p &apos;s and q &apos;s , &quot; means &quot; watch your alcohol consumption . &quot;
i &apos;ll be right back .
holy cow . so there &apos;s an origin for everything .
what &apos;s up ?
a little business .
like what ?
why ? you want to hear this ?
we decided to give
a bigger percentage to the union guys than the customs guys .
you &apos;re shitting me , right ? that &apos;s what you guys came up with ?
everybody seemed pleased .
damn it , now i &apos;ll have to go down there ...
and do a go @-@ see with everybody , from the harbormaster on down ...
which is exactly what i was trying to avoid .
you want it renegotiated , that &apos;s what we &apos;ll do .
don &apos;t make me go down to perth amboy .
i &apos;m trying to free myself up to do a little global thinking .
right .
so , girls , what &apos;s it gonna be ?
i &apos;ll have what i always have .
chicken mario ? 15 years of chicken mario .
can &apos;t you try the veal chop or something ?
why are you giving me a hard time ? i like the chicken .
hello , beautiful people .
look who it is .
hi , how are you ?
remember valentina ?
yeah , nice to see you again .
yeah , same here .
you the one who pulled that horseshit stunt ?
we &apos;re gonna have some steaks .
maybe i &apos;ll have a steak .
you don &apos;t need a steak .
i know i don &apos;t need a steak .
do me a favor .
don &apos;t fuck with the salt shaker .
you like the sole ?
the scampi for me .
i don &apos;t know , give me ...
come on , you &apos;re getting anorexic .
i &apos;m gonna make a call . okay ?
you &apos;re wasting away .
come on , what are you gonna do ?
here .
no , you keep it .
i don &apos;t want your consolation prize .
i bet you have a standing order at the jewelry store .
i gotta be getting back to my table .
what , to the blonde out there ?
does she fuck you better than me ? suck your dick better than me ?
come on .
really , tony , just tell me . how come i can &apos;t see you again ?
because you fuck ralph .
you got morals all of a sudden ?
i don &apos;t know about morals , but i do got rules .
some dago macho bullshit about &quot; don &apos;t fuck your friend &apos;s girlfriend &quot; ?
yeah , that .
but not just that .
then what ?
look , that day in the countryside , that was ...
it was great .
did i do something wrong ? i &apos;ll fix it .
no , you can &apos;t fix the shit i &apos;m talking about .
i don &apos;t wanna be where ralph cifaretto has been .
you prick !
a one @-@ time thing is one thing , but to get into a relationship ...
i gotta get back to my dinner .
you don &apos;t know anything . let me tell you what &apos;s really going on .
he doesn &apos;t fuck me . i swear to god , he &apos;s some kind of freak or something .
you two don &apos;t have sex ?
no .
sort of yeah , but not ...
all right , have a nice life .
go ahead . you go back first . i &apos;ll wait a minute .
we shouldn &apos;t go back together .
everything come out all right ?
yeah .
it &apos;s me , valentina .
you got no reason to be calling me .
i have to tell you everything .
i mean , i didn &apos;t want to tell you before , because it &apos;s just so embarrassing .
where are you ?
i &apos;m at ralph &apos;s .
oh , christ !
no , it &apos;s okay .
he left .
ralph does not have sex like other people , regular people .
it &apos;s all some kind of kinky shit . believe me , i am not hung @-@ up .
i &apos;ve done a lot . i &apos;ve done girls ... i &apos;ve done threesomes , and i &apos;ve done ...
with him ?
no , tony , please , just listen .
ralph is loco . for real , okay ?
he just makes me do stuff , not really even sexual .
like last night i just wanted him to fuck me , just so i can get back at you .
but all he wanted me to do was drip candle wax on his balls ...
then he went into the bathroom and jerked himself off .
now , i don &apos;t call that having sex with someone .
oh , jesus h. christ .
last week , i swear to god ...
he told me to rub his dick raw with a cheese grater .
get the fuck out of here .
i wouldn &apos;t do it ! i told him to fuck off .
my accountant is here .
will you call me ?
i gotta go .
mozzarella ?
let me ask you a question . you think ralph &apos;s
a little weird about women ?
i don &apos;t know , ton &apos; .
i mean , he beat one to death just for ...
i forget . what was it again ?
maybe you &apos;re feeling guilty .
i don &apos;t see that .
why would i ?
because he &apos;s a friend of yours ,
and you &apos;re cuckolding him .
cuckolding is when a man has an affair with another &apos;s wife .
she &apos;s not his wife anyway . she &apos;s his cumare .
and therefore has no status whatever .
cumares have status .
i mean , it &apos;s not like in the old days , when a man had a wife ...
and then sort of a second wife .
used to be the men would take out their wives on fridays ...
and their cumares on saturdays . or maybe it &apos;s the other way around .
anyway , when i came up , it wasn &apos;t so formal .
business associate of mine &apos;s got two full families .
one up here , one down in sea girt .
and his second wife busts his balls identical to the first .
sounds like a complicated arrangement .
i &apos;m afraid our time is up .
just give me another minute .
i have a patient waiting .
well , let him wait .
you make me wait out there all the time .
i just wanna ask you if it &apos;s possible for a man to go out with a woman ...
without really doing anything with them .
you &apos;ll have to be more specific .
he likes them to hurt him . and that &apos;s it .
and then he goes and he ...
takes care of himself , his own needs .
he sounds like a textbook masochist.- like s &amp; m ?
the &quot; m &quot; part , yes .
i thought all that stuff was just like a run @-@ up to the act .
that &apos;s the case for many people . but not for people with paraphilias .
for them , receiving pain , being humiliated ...
becomes , in and of itself , the sexual release .
like many other things , we believe it &apos;s rooted in childhood .
we can continue this next week .
just one more second .
i received regular beatings when i was a kid ...
but i &apos;m not going around looking for some woman ...
to hook up jumper cables to my private parts .
it &apos;s not a simple one @-@ to @-@ one .
more than likely , he had a controlling and punishing mother .
she loved him , but showed it only in connection ...
with some sort of violent or abusive act .
is everything about everybody really about their mothers ?
all right , back to the other thing .
for a guy like that , he &apos;s going out with a woman ...
he could technically not have penisary contact with her vulva .
it sounds like you &apos;re asking me for personal information ...
i really can &apos;t give you .
good morning , pickwick framing .
hello ?
hello ?
it &apos;s so heartbreaking to hear those women talk about what they were going through
and what they are going through .
the second woman , joan , her case is really not very unusual .
her husband was the financial planner . she really did not have ...
much involvement in the finances at the home .
what are your thoughts on that ?
women tend to have the feeling that they &apos;re not confident .
men tend to be overconfident , actually , in the financial area .
and women have to take responsibility , and have to accept the fact ...
that something like this ...
we don &apos;t need no thought control
you have to have a contingency plan if your husband doesn &apos;t come home ...
to take care of the finances .
you gotta get up , ma . you can &apos;t lie there day and night .
i wanna go home .
there is no more home , ma . we sold it . you know that .
they keep making me eat all alone . that &apos;s that cookie and minn .
i tried to be so nice .
i bought cookie a card from the gift shop downstairs .
i cared enough , and i sent the very best .
don &apos;t you worry , ma . i &apos;m gonna talk to this social director .
she &apos;s the one to straighten this all out .
but in the meantime , maybe you can make new friends .
but you gotta get up out of bed . at least sit up .
no .
friggitoria fiorenzano ... in my opinion ,
this is probably one of the closest things we &apos;ll find in naples ...
to what you really should open . it &apos;s an all @-@ day snack shop , pizzeria ...
friggitoria and rosticceria .
roast shop , fry shop , pizza shop .
here are four examples ...
of the classic neapolitan pride .
it &apos;s in a light batter , fried till very crisp .
we &apos;ve got those zucchini flowers , you recognize those ?
we &apos;re bringing her back to the track in two weeks .
lois says she &apos;s ready to race .
thanks .
thanks , hon .
i like my drink with extra olives .
you should know how your regular customers like their drinks .
my regular customers are the ones who pay .
i &apos;ll get you your olives .
what do you have to give her shit for ?
she likes it , it &apos;s banter .
i don &apos;t think she likes it , or you .
i don &apos;t give a flying fuck , my brother , what any little slit thinks of me .
does that include ...
what &apos;s her name ?
who ?
you brought her to the stables .
valentina . her especially .
and her , i &apos;m crazy about .
i &apos;m telling you , this broad knows things .
i &apos;ve never been fucked so long or so good .
i may have to marry her .
these enough ?
you know , no reason to be snotty .
my dear departed mother used to say :
&quot; you catch more flies with honey ... &quot; than you can with vinegar . &quot;
well , mine always told me not to let myself be talked down to by losers .
she said you can tell everything about a man by the way he treats women .
you ever think about your mother ?
she &apos;s dead .
you two didn &apos;t get along very well , right ?
she had her demanding ways .
when you were a kid , did she ever ...
no , i gotta go .
the mambo queen awaits .
i &apos;m sorry your mom &apos;s having a difficult adjustment period . sit .
it &apos;s not her . it &apos;s the rest of them . they single her out .
sometimes i think this place is like high school with wheelchairs .
tell your mother to be patient . things will settle down .
all right , i &apos;ll talk to her again .
but what the hell are you gonna do for us ? what we pay here .
i &apos;m speaking from years of experience .
your mom &apos;s going to have to learn ...
to accept responsibility for her own behavior .
like what ?
go ahead .
for one thing , she cries a lot .
she &apos;s always in tears .
at mass , in the exercise room , at music appreciation .
she &apos;s got a big heart .
let me finish .
she doesn &apos;t always put her teeth in .
the girls don &apos;t like that .
this is not good .
right . also , she &apos;s a tattletale .
she tells on the other girls for the slightest infraction .
she &apos;s just not very adept at making friends .
she &apos;s gonna have to make more of an effort .
you might want to talk to her about this .
hey , conny contino
ever get those washing machines ?
i don &apos;t understand . you want to know this shit ?
&apos;cause you go back on everything sil and me get settled .
i don &apos;t got a right to be concerned ?
hold on .
go .
long time no see .
is this you ?
i am me .
i &apos;ve been busy , you know .
then i forgive you .
when can i see you ? i &apos;ve got something to tell you .
look , i told you the situation .
come on , tony .
just for a coffee or a drink or something .
all right , you know the coach house on route 21 in passaic ?
no , but i can find it .
can you be there by noon ?
nothing could keep me away .
all right , i &apos;ll see you there .
all right , i want to see you and sil this afternoon .
2 : 00 at the other place .
so sorry i &apos;m late . i had to make up this whole thing at work .
it &apos;s all right .
what can i get for you ?
evian , whatever .
so , i &apos;m here . what &apos;s this big thing you have to tell me ?
i broke up with ralph .
when ?
last night . i just couldn &apos;t take it .
he brought out this leather mask with this ...
all right .
this means we can be together .

it &apos;s a little awkward .
it &apos;s about ralph .
that scumbag ?

i &apos;m trying to find out about his sex life .
and who would know better ?
he would . ask him .
i can &apos;t .
i can only ask you .
i mean , is he weird about sex ?
why you interested in this ?
i got my reasons . managerial .
you know , like the army ,
it &apos;s got policies about this shit , on account of combat .
i have to tell you , i &apos;m finding this entire conversation insulting .
here we go .
you &apos;re asking me to betray confidences .
i mean , no matter what either one of us think of the guy ...
$ 3,000 .
how &apos;d you come up with that figure ?
it &apos;s a number that i thought you &apos;d say yes to .
you thought right .
so , what have you heard ?
you pay me $ 3,000 , i &apos;ll answer your questions .
he bottoms from the top .
i don &apos;t even know what that means .
it means he has to control things , but he pretends he doesn &apos;t .
like , he &apos;d make me fuck him with a strap @-@ on ... and call him my bitch ,
shit like that .
what about plain old fucking ?
i &apos;m telling you . he can &apos;t get hard that way .
and if he could , i don &apos;t think that he &apos;d want to .
i couldn &apos;t believe it when you called .
i was so happy .
i &apos;m feeling pretty happy myself .
why the big change of heart ?
well , i was never hesitating &apos; cause of you .
i just had to get my head into a place ...
where i felt that i could really commit , you know .
to lavish all the care on you that you should have .
i don &apos;t see why i have to do anything i don &apos;t want to .
this is green grove . here the senior citizen is king and queen .

this is a stupid thing for your son to get hurt over .
i didn &apos;t live for 84 years to have to be nice to somebody i don &apos;t like !
haven &apos;t i earned that right ?
ma , i &apos;m gonna have to say this .
if you can &apos;t get into the spirit of this thing ...
