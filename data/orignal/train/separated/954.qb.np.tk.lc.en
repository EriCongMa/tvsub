第三季 第十四集
&lt; i &gt; ian &apos;s wife jane passed away ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... gaby made a new friend ... &lt; / i &gt;
a friend friend , not a girlfriend .
&lt; i &gt; the finger of guilt ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; i think it &apos;s a phone number . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; pointed toward mike . &lt; / i &gt;
they tested my wrench
and found traces of this monique &apos;s blood .
&lt; i &gt; but he still couldn &apos;t remember . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; bree found a bag of evidence . &lt; / i &gt;
you have to do something .
not until we put these back in her house .
&lt; i &gt; orson had a night ... &lt; / i &gt;
what do you want ?
a grandchild .
&lt; i &gt; ... he &apos;d soon rather forget . &lt; / i &gt;
you raped my husband .
i could be expecting right now .
&lt; i &gt; it had been two months since &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; mike delfino awakened from his coma , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and the memories he had lost were finally starting to return . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; he could now recall the first time he saw wisteria lane ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... and the first time he met his new neighbors ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... and the first time he heard susan mayer laugh . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but the memory he most wanted to reclaim still eluded him . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; that &apos;s why he had gone to see a hypnotherapist , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; so that he could finally remember everything . &lt; / i &gt;
i thought you &apos;d never get here .
i &apos;m sorry . the traffic was terrible .
sorry about that .
i called my landlord when the pipe started leaking ,
and he recommended you .
i was so flustered i couldn &apos;t find a piece of paper .
i wrote your number on my hand .
after you finish the sink maybe you &apos;d help me wash it off .
look ...
i &apos;m flattered , but i &apos;m seeing somebody .
me too ...
... but he &apos;s married and i &apos;m drunk .
your , uh , s trap is cracked .
i don &apos;t have one with me .
i &apos;ll have to go to the hardware store .
now ? it &apos;s late .
that water is gonna keep seeping ,
cause a lot more damage .
i &apos;ll be back in an hour .
i &apos;ll be waiting .
miss poulier ?
i , uh ... got that part for the sink .
hello ?
what happened , mike ?
god , i almost had it . i was so close .
close to what ?
when i went back to monique &apos;s place ,
somebody else was there .
who ?
i don &apos;t know . i couldn &apos;t see it .
&lt; i &gt; yes , there were still many things &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; mike delfino couldn &apos;t remember . &lt; / i &gt;
then why are you smiling ?
&lt; i &gt; but he &apos;d finally remembered the most important thing of all . &lt; / i &gt;
&apos;cause now i know i didn &apos;t kill her .
&lt; i &gt; it was 6 : 00 in the morning , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and bree hodge was faced with a dilemma &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; familiar to countless housewives . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; should she wake her husband to discuss recent events &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; that were weighing heavily on her mind ? &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; or should she let him continue to get the rest he needed ? &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; bree made the obvious choice . &lt; / i &gt;
i &apos;m sorry .
but you &apos;ve been out cold for 10 hours and we need to talk .
i remember drinking the scotch ,
and then alma suddenly sitting up .
but after that ... nothing .
oh , dear . i &apos;m not sure how to tell you this ,
but after alma knocked you out ,
she assaulted you .
where ?
sexually .
she had sex with you .
that &apos;s impossible .
your drink was laced with pills for ... erectile dysfunction .
but i was dead to the world .
no , dear , you were dead to the waist .
i had sex with alma and i wasn &apos;t even conscious ?
how reminiscent of our marriage .
ok , this is no joke .
she raped you and your mother helped .
after we dress we &apos;re going to the police .
i can &apos;t do that .
orson , i know you &apos;re embarrassed ,
but what they did to you was a crime .
i can &apos;t go to the police . not now , not ever .
orson ! your ex @-@ wife is a homicidal rapist ,
&lt; i &gt; and your mother is straight out of i , claudius . &lt; / i &gt;
why do you refuse to deal with them ?
i think it &apos;s time i told you about the night
monique poulier died .
what do you think of this one ?
pretty sexy .
is sexy what you &apos;re going for at the funeral
of your boyfriend &apos;s wife ?
you &apos;re right . i &apos;ll keep looking .
why are you even going ? won &apos;t it be weird ?
no , it &apos;ll be fine . ian wants me there .
yeah , but it &apos;ll be all of jane &apos;s friends and family ,
and you &apos;ll be the other woman who swooped in ...
ok , yes , it &apos;ll be weird , but it &apos;s not about me .
this is about jane and ian .
what if i wear this one ?
then it &apos;ll be about jane , ian and your boobs .
i have got to get more depressing clothes .
ok , i just need to keep a low profile through the memorial .
&apos;cause once i get through this ,
ian can officially introduce me as his girlfriend ,
and we &apos;ll finally be a normal , non @-@ adulterous couple .
what does this one say to you ?
modest , reserved ,
and definitely not dating the dead lady &apos;s husband .
sold .
i &apos;m not gonna get you towels for your birthday .
let &apos;s go to the jewelry department .
no , zach .
i only accept jewelry from men i plan on sleeping with .
well , ok , so where does that leave me ?
you can buy me that toilet seat cover .
fine . i ... we &apos;re just friends .
can i at least take you out for a birthday dinner ?
there will be no celebration . i &apos;m turning 31 .
i &apos;m a single woman in her thirties .
&lt; i &gt; i now have to subscribe to cat fancy . &lt; / i &gt;
it &apos;s the law .
age is just a number . it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
it means something to me .
being alone at this age , it &apos;s ... hard ,
and it &apos;s only gonna get harder . i &apos;m so depressed .
let me buy you a car .
no thanks .
but i do need a liquid soap dispenser .
go .
hello .
oh , sorry . didn &apos;t mean to disturb you .
i was just trying to see whether or not
this was a regular king or a california king .
i think it &apos;s a regular . california kings are much longer .
is your wife particularly tall ?
oh , i &apos;m , uh ... i &apos;m not married .
oh . why don &apos;t you try it out .
it &apos;s ok . i can wait until you get off .
that &apos;ll happen a lot faster if you just hop on board .
i &apos;m sorry ?
it was a shameless sex joke .
i was flirting with you .
oh ! right .
sorry , i can be a little dense .
can we start over ?
no . moment &apos;s gone . you killed it .
you know , i &apos;m in a bit of a hurry ,
but maybe we can try this again sometime .
it could happen .
hey . sorry it took so long .
mr. young ?
oh , you know my &quot; friend &quot; zach ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m luke ... purdue .
i &apos;m on your legal team .
i &apos;m taking point on the halverson deal .
yeah , right .
again , it was nice meeting you .
sir .
that was really weird .
i don &apos;t even know the guy , and he works for me .
works for me , too .
bree ...
please don &apos;t touch me .
all this time you &apos;ve said you wanted the truth .
that &apos;s before i knew what it was .
you see , that &apos;s why i &apos;ve tried to protect you from this .
yeah , but you weren &apos;t just trying to protect me , were you ?
what do you want me to do ?
exonerate mike .
how could you stand by
and let an innocent man be dragged off to prison ?
you think i haven &apos;t felt terrible ?
unless after he &apos;d been in a coma because
some lunatic ran him over .
he has had a rough year . i want to help mike .
how do i do that without implicating myself ?
i could go to jail .
i don &apos;t care if you go to jail .
you have done a horrible thing and you have to make it right .
i mean it , orson .
if you don &apos;t fix this , i will .
well , i guess i &apos;m in no position to argue .
no , you &apos;re not .
morning , andrew .
hey , orson .
i was just gonna ask if you guys wanted some coffee .
oh , yeah , thanks . i could use some .
it &apos;s gonna be a long day .
thank you .
thanks .
thank you .
mom !
dinner is in an hour . you know the rules .
and so do you .
i know , i know , but he gave me the face .
you fell for the face . what are you , a rookie ?
ok , you &apos;re right .
sorry , buddy . mom &apos;s the boss .
i feel nothing .
hi , lynette . hey , tom .
how &apos;s the restaurant coming ?
ready for the big opening ?
oh , we &apos;re getting there . let me give you a coupon .
free extra topping on any medium or large .
how nice .
but you know what would be even nicer ?
hire my nephew to work for you .
you know , the coupon &apos;s good all week .
look , i don &apos;t know what lies you &apos;ve heard about austin .
you can &apos;t be listening to vicious gossip .
i heard he got arrested for beating some guy up .
ok , that one &apos;s pretty accurate .
edie , i &apos;m all staffed up .
oh , come on , help me out .
seriously . ever since julie dumped him
he &apos;s been depressed and mopey . he &apos;s driving me crazy .
please ! any crappy job you got .
i guess i could use an extra guy in back .
have him there tomorrow , 8 : 00 in the morning .
thank you . thank you so , so much .
edie , you forgot your coupon .
oh , tom , please .
you &apos;ve checked out my butt enough times
to know i don &apos;t eat pizza .
zach .
i know .
you said you wanted to be alone for your birthday ,
but that &apos;s just dumb .
so i &apos;m gonna take you out .
oh , that &apos;s so sweet , but i ...
don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s gonna be
one friend keeping another friend company .
it &apos;s not gonna be a date .
luke &apos;s gonna be here in 20 minutes ,
and that kind of will be a date .
luke ?
my lawyer guy ?
yeah .
that isn &apos;t a problem , is it ?
&apos;cause this is what friends do ,
they talk about each other &apos;s dates .
no , i &apos;m cool .
have a great time . uh , i &apos;m gonna get out of your hair .
so you think this guy &apos;s really into you ?
well , he seemed to like me in the mattress department ,
so here &apos;s hoping i like him in the mattress department .
what ? friends say these things .
orson .
oh , well , i &apos;m in luck .
the whole coven is here .
i just stopped by to say thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
i bought a pregnancy test , but it &apos;s too soon to take it .
i wasn &apos;t talking about the sex ,
though hats off , mother ,
for colluding in my rape .
i think it &apos;s great that we can still surprise each other .
no , i was talking more about what you did for me and bree .
what did i do ?
your little stunt made her so angry
she demanded we go to the police .
she forced my hand .
so i told her everything .
everything ?
that is rather unwise .
i faced my worst fear ,
the moment i felt sure would end my marriage ,
and guess what ? it didn &apos;t .
she forgave you ?
not entirely .
not yet . but she &apos;ll come around .
the good news is
the months of dread , the fear of discovery ,
that &apos;s all over .
so thank you .
and goodbye .
wait ! i could be carrying your child .
i don &apos;t care if you &apos;ve got the hodge septuplets in there .
i &apos;m sticking with bree .
why must he make everything so difficult ?
uh , floor &apos;s done .
i told you i wanted this floor to sparkle like your mom &apos;s .
now does this floor look &quot; bree hodge clean &quot; to you ?
uh , no . looks &quot; andrew van de kamp clean . &quot;
but your disappointment in me is very bree hodge .
ok , just for that , you get to help me take out the trash .
i know you think i &apos;m being a hardass ,
but i &apos;m just looking for a basic level of professionalism .
austin ? what the hell &apos;s going on here ?
just talking to the delivery guy .
hey , where &apos;d he go ?
are you high ?
only ...
totally .
austin !
dude , not smart .
but i have good reason , and when you hear it
you &apos;re not gonna make that face anymore .
julie mayer dumped me
and i &apos;m very ... very upset .
your face is not changing .
get your stuff ,
get the hell out of my restaurant . you &apos;re fired . go on .
the floor &apos;s looking pretty clean right now , isn &apos;t it ?
you said he &apos;d come back to me .
you said deep down he still loves me .
you heard him today , he hates me .
you ravished him against his will .
he &apos;s bound to be touchy in the short run .
i &apos;ll handle orson , you just worry about the baby .
he said he doesn &apos;t care .
he says that now ,
but he will not abandon his own flesh and blood .
you &apos;re his flesh and blood .
he put you in a home .
you know , i usually don &apos;t say this to expectant mothers ,
but for god &apos;s sake have a scotch .
i should just call the police .
what ?
i know what he did .
if he &apos;s never gonna love me , why should i protect him ?
i &apos;d rather see him in jail
than playing house with tammy tight @-@ ass .
knock it off , alma .
i will make orson come around .
i don &apos;t believe you anymore .
she &apos;s got her claws in him and she &apos;s not letting go .
don &apos;t be so sure .
i was looking over at their house last night ,
and i saw something
very ... curious .
what ?
you can &apos;t see it down here .
we need to be up higher .
how can you see anything from here ?
there &apos;s not even a window .
gloria ?
gloria !
just calm down , sweetheart .
gloria , let me out !
stress isn &apos;t good for the baby .
what are you doing ?
gloria !
so how are you holding up ?
better , now that you &apos;re here .
oh ! no , i want to , um , keep a low profile .
i &apos;ve kissed a hundred lips today .
i assure you , it would look more conspicuous if i didn &apos;t .
ok , that &apos;s enough .
ian . oh ! you must be shattered .
i know i am .
thanks for coming , lynn .
you know , jane used to kid me about you .
did she ?
she &apos;d say , &quot; lynn ,
if anything ever happens to me , i want you to marry ian .
you &apos;re pushy .
maybe you could get him to pick up his socks . &quot;
listen , um , if you ever need to talk , i &apos;m here .
why don &apos;t you stop over some night for a home @-@ cooked meal ?
oh , that &apos;s very kind of you ,
but i wouldn &apos;t dream of putting you out .
well , i won &apos;t take no for an answer .
have you got my number ?
i sure as hell do .
well , i &apos;m sure i &apos;ll find it in jane &apos;s phone book .
let me give it to you , just in case .
call any time .
watch yourself .
so i was there on a plumbing job .
it makes complete sense . i had no reason to want her dead .
i always thought hypnotherapy was a bunch of bull .
but damn .
this is huge , man . you didn &apos;t kill anyone .
the murderer has to be this yellow gloves guy .
yeah , but no matter how much i concentrate ,
i still can &apos;t see a face .
ah , you will . look at the progress that you &apos;ve made so far .
you &apos;re gonna find this guy ,
and then you &apos;re gonna hand his ass over to the cops .
yeah . something like that .
hey , guys .
well , ian seems to be holding up .
it &apos;s just a mask . the man is devastated .
tomorrow night ,
i &apos;m gonna swing by his place to offer him a casserole
and a shoulder to cry on .
will that shoulder be wearing a spaghetti strap
and chanel no. 5 ?
you know me so well .
oh ! look at him .
even in mourning the man is scrumptious .
i &apos;m sorry for eavesdropping ,
but don &apos;t you think
your conversation is a little inappropriate ?
i mean , we &apos;re here to grieve ,
not cruise .
i &apos;m sorry , and you are ... ?
susan mayer .
i &apos;m ... a friend of the family .
then you know how lonely ian &apos;s been .
and if i want to do something about that ,
it &apos;s no business of yours .
look , just to save you the embarrassment ,
ian &apos;s seeing someone .
who ?
i &apos;m not at liberty to say .
under the circumstances ,
they &apos;d prefer to keep it quiet .
i don &apos;t believe it . if there were some bimbo in the picture ,
i &apos;d have heard about it .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , he &apos;s free meat .
ok , it &apos;s me .
what ?
i &apos;m the bimbo . he &apos;s my meat .
all righty . i just wanted to clear that up .
and now i &apos;m going to go find myself a seat
with a better view .
here are your w @-@ 4s .
please sign them
and get them back to me as soon as possible .
also , i &apos;m gonna need a copy ... hi .
... of your driver &apos;s license .
austin ?
yeah .
what are you doing here ? i fired you .
well , mr. scavo gave me my job back .
you hired him back ?
did he tell you he was stoned on the job ?
yeah , and he knows if he does it again he is out of here .
look , i don &apos;t know what kind of hustle you pulled on him .
it won &apos;t work on me .
lynette .
no . i fired him .
and you are gonna stay fired .
honey , can i see you in the back for a sec ?
what the hell are you doing ,
talking to me like that in front of my staff ?
sorry , but you totally blindsided me out there .
no , i was the one who was blindsided .
you just went off me without hearing what my reasons were .
well , i &apos;m sorry . let &apos;s hear them .
what are your reasons for bringing back joe bong @-@ hit ?
i &apos;ll tell you if you drop that tone
and stop making that face .
what is ... ?
this was a business decision .
in case you hadn &apos;t noticed ,
and i hadn &apos;t until the waitresses pointed it out to me
austin is hot .
he &apos;ll bring in every girl from fairview high
and half the boys &apos; chorus .
what &apos;s more , edie is gonna include our menu
in the welcome packet she gives to new homeowners .
i &apos;m not sure she &apos;d feel so generous
if we fired her nephew .
those reasons working for you ?
yeah .
i just wish you &apos;d told me before you rehired him .
i mean , i am the manager .
right .
but i &apos;m the boss .
well , kinda .
no , no , not &quot; kind of . &quot;
really . i &apos;m the boss .
you &apos;re pulling rank on me ?
look , at home , you get to be in charge .
you decide how we discipline the boys , what car we buy ...
everything .
i consult you .
sure ! and if you disagree , you ignore me .
look , when i go home ,
basically , i check my balls at the door .
and that &apos;s fine . it works .
but for this to work , when you walk through that door ,
you gotta check yours .
ok .
really ?
really . this place is your dream ,
so ... consider them checked .
thanks . now i need you to do just one more thing .
whatever you say , boss .
i don &apos;t care if you think you know what &apos;s best .
you don &apos;t , i do , because
i &apos;m the boss ,
and what i say goes .
that &apos;s it . give it to me .
so when i make a decision it stays made ,
you got that , lynette ?
yes , sir . enough.- just one more .
and if i want your opinion , i &apos;ll ask for it !
but i probably won &apos;t ,
because i &apos;m the boss . are we clear ?
seriously stop or i will hurt you .
ok , i made my point .
anybody needs me , i &apos;ll be in the back , drinking a beer .
this is delicious .
don &apos;t get too full . you have to leave room for dessert .
oh ? what are we having ?
well , let &apos;s just say it &apos;s going to be served upstairs
and involves whipped cream .
is it pudding ?
no .
oh . you &apos;re flirting .
do it again , i swear i &apos;ll get it .
that &apos;s ok . do you want some coffee ?
you bet i want coffee .
nice and hot and ...
just finish your soup and we &apos;ll get naked .
sorry to bother you , mrs. solis .
i work with luke . is he available ?
charles ? what are you doing here ?
you forgot to initial some pages on the halverson contract .
can &apos;t this wait ?
market &apos;s already open in tokyo .
go ahead . i &apos;m gonna open some more wine .
快离开 但别做得太明显
mr. young wants to make sure you understand that last part .
do you ?
yeah .
i get it .
so when we think of jane ,
let us remember her kind heart
and her loving spirit .
and now , if there &apos;s someone who &apos;d like to
share a special memory of our dear friend ...
i would .
hi , i &apos;m lynn dean .
jane and i were sorority sisters .
if she were here , she &apos;d make me sing our pledge song ,
but i think there &apos;s already been enough grief for one day .
now , i know how badly we &apos;ve all felt for ian
during his long , lonely vigil .
so i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be as happy as i was to learn
his vigil wasn &apos;t quite so lonely after all .
oh , dear god .
no , he found a warm , caring woman
to share his burden ...
... and so much else .
some people might find the fact that she &apos;s here today
inappropriate ,
but i think she &apos;s a hero .
she dared to brave the scorn
of those who might find her actions questionable
or even unsavory .
oh , i was gonna ask her to stand ,
but i see she already has .
susan mayer , say hello .
hey .
guess someone &apos;s in a hurry to get on with the evening .
yeah .
well , i should go .
what ? - i have a lot more work to do on that halverson deal .
sorry.- but can &apos;t it wait till after dessert ?
and by dessert i mean sex .
you are clear on that , right ? - painfully .
my job &apos;s at stake here . i really don &apos;t have much of a choice .
i think you &apos;ve got lots of choices .
here &apos;s one of &apos; em .
hello ?
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
what ?
i gave you an order
and i expect you to follow it .
now get out of there .
i &apos;m trying , sir .
i &apos;m meeting some resistance to the plan we &apos;ve agreed on .
ok , she &apos;s not letting you leave ? that &apos;s fine .
here &apos;s what i want you to say .
ok , i &apos;ll give it a shot , sir .
is that your office ?
yeah , they , uh ...
they really need me over there .
ok . so ... come back when you &apos;re done . i &apos;ll wait up .
i can &apos;t . no , i really can &apos;t .
what is with you ?
an hour ago you were really into me ,
and now you can &apos;t get out fast enough !
ok . truth ?
i thought i could do this , but i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m just not attracted to you .
of course you are !
no , see ...
i really only date women in their twenties .
what ?
sorry .
you &apos;re too old for me .
i still got a lot of kick for an old broad , don &apos;t i ?
mom ?
mom ! mom , are you all right ?
don &apos;t move her . she might have broken something .
yes , we need an ambulance , please ,
at 4354 wisteria lane .
my wife &apos;s had a bad fall . please hurry .
what the hell is this ?
mrs. hodge was very lucky .
she only suffered a slight concussion .
if you have any more questions
the doctor should be back soon .
thank you .
thank god , i was so worried .
yeah , i &apos;ll bet .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i heard you two yesterday .
all that stuff about you maybe going to jail .
that &apos;s none of your business ,
but if you think i had anything to do with bree falling ...
i &apos;m not stupid .
i know the cops &apos;ve been all over you about that dead woman .
and mom said for you to fix it or she would .
is this accident how you fixed it ?
you &apos;re upset , i get it ...
no , no , you don &apos;t get it .
there &apos;s a reason my mom put me out on the street last year .
you &apos;ve never met that guy .
you &apos;ve never met bad andrew .
but hurt my mom , and you will .
i love your mother .
i &apos;m gonna do everything i can to protect her .
yeah , so am i.
hi , i &apos;m bree hodge &apos;s son .
you see that guy right there ? that &apos;s her husband .
do not , under any circumstances , let him be alone with her .
why ?
because it &apos;s his fault she &apos;s in here .
he &apos;s a dangerous guy .
i &apos;ve warned you . anything happens to her ,
you &apos;re liable .
good night , dad .
oh , you &apos;re home .
i thought you &apos;re still out on your date .
date &apos;s over . what do you want ?
i thought since i can &apos;t take you out for your birthday ,
i &apos;d leave you a present .
don &apos;t worry , it &apos;s not expensive .
aw , zach !
so how &apos;d your date go ?
is he crazy ? you &apos;re not old .
you did not see the look on his face when i tried to kiss him .
it was like he was sniffing expired milk .
that &apos;s ridiculous . you &apos;re gorgeous .
and you &apos;re just gonna get prettier every year .
that &apos;s so sweet ... but it &apos;s a lie .
every tick of the clock takes away something .
zach , what am i gonna do
when i &apos;m not pretty anymore ?
it &apos;s never gonna happen .
i &apos;m gonna take a little nap , ok ? just for a minute .
take as long as you &apos;d like .
susan , i &apos;ve looked everywhere for you .
i didn &apos;t think to start with the , um
... embalming room .
yeah , i &apos;ll be having night terrors from now on ...
... which i deserve .
look , no one is judging you .
if anything ,
they &apos;re judging that dreadful lynn .
i should be thanking you for driving her away .
usually takes a crucifix and some garlic .
i &apos;m so sorry i ruined jane &apos;s funeral .
no , you didn &apos;t .
yes , i did .
it &apos;s just ...
what ?
i thought after we got through this really painful day ,
things would start to get better .
i thought i could be more a part of your world .
now all your friends and family are gonna think of me
as the crazy lady from jane &apos;s funeral .
oh , god . oh , ian ... ok .
this is not supposed to be about me .
you should be upstairs ...
... to say goodbye .
i &apos;m just gonna hide out here with the departed
until everybody leaves .
no .
no more hiding.we &apos;ve been doing it far too long .
you have nothing to be ashamed of .
you helped me through the most difficult part of my life .
i love you . i want to spend the rest of my life with you .
i want to marry you .
ian , are you proposing to me ?
well ... i guess , maybe , i ...
i am .
whoa !
before you say another word ...
... take a look around .
oh . right .
i hadn &apos;t really thought a lot about this moment ,
but when i did ...
the table we were at didn &apos;t have a blood gutter .
then may i reopen the subject
at a more opportune time and place ?
yes .
i accept your proposal to propose .
shall we ?
now i want you to dig deep .
if you feel your memory blocked ,
just count to three and the block will melt away .
it is natural and easy for you to recall anything .
now remember monique poulier .
remember the night you met her ...
miss poulier ?
i &apos;ve , uh ... got that part for the sink .
hello ?
sorry . monique &apos;s upstairs taking a nap .
she wasn &apos;t feeling well .
mike ? did you see something ?
i &apos;m her boyfriend . i , uh ...
... figured she &apos;d want to wake up to a clean kitchen .
well , i &apos;ll just finish up with the sink and be out of your hair .
uh , why don &apos;t you let me take care of the sink ?
i mean , i &apos;m pretty handy and it &apos;s getting late .
oh . i don &apos;t mind staying .
no , look , it &apos;s ok.i got it under control .
here . this should cover what we owe you .
tell miss poulier i hope she feels better .
will do .
oh , hey .
don &apos;t forget your wrench .
mike , where are you going ?
mike !
hey , mr. delfino .
i need to , uh , talk to your stepdad .
orson &apos;s not here . he went to the hospital with my mom .
she &apos;s fine . thanks for asking .
mr. hodge ...
your wife &apos;s just sleeping .
i suggest you go home and do the same .
i will .
you ok ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s ...
there was a time when we were all so happy .
i just can &apos;t seem to remember it anymore .
&lt; i &gt; recapturing the past is a tricky business . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; while most memories are simply souvenirs of a happier time &lt; / i &gt;
hey there .
&lt; i &gt; ... others can be quite deadly . &lt; / i &gt;
hey , mike . what brings you to the hospital ?
i &apos;ve been seeing a hypnotherapist .
she &apos;s helping me fill the gaps in my memory .
how &apos;s it going ?
it &apos;s working .
