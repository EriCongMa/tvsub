第二十一集
you tried to take away someone that i love ,
and now i am taking back my son .
maybe this will make you believe .
why is it so important to you that i do ?
because everyone needs you .
snow ! i will find you !
i will always find you !
king george took james . i have to get him back .
you can &apos;t do it alone .
let &apos;s show that king what snow white
and seven dwarves can really do !
do you want to come and live with me ?
more than anything .
then buckle up . we &apos;re leaving storybrooke .
i don &apos;t recall us expecting any company .
sheriff swan .
what are you doing here ?
henry invited me .
do you honestly believe i &apos;d allow you into my house
for dinner after all the threats you made to my family ?
i didn &apos;t come for dinner .
then what did you come for ?
you .
we all did .
henry .
no . no . let me go .
i command it !
after everything you &apos;ve done to all of us ? !
my apologies , your majesty , but my conscience is clear !
you &apos;re not queen anymore , sister !
tighter !
she needs to feel our pain !
you took our love and ripped it apart !
and now you &apos;re gonna pay !
rotten to the core .
i just wanted to win ...
for once .
you took away our happiness ,
and now it &apos;s our turn to take away yours .
what ? what ?
henry .
henry , please don &apos;t let them do this to me .
you did this to yourself .
is that all your stuff ?
all i need .
wait . you wanna go now ?
we &apos;re leaving now ?
i &apos;m getting you out of here ,
away from all this , away from her .
no . no . stop the car .
you can &apos;t leave storybrooke . you have to break the curse .
no , i don &apos;t . i have to help you .
but you &apos;re a hero . you can &apos;t run .
you have to help everybody .
henry , i know it &apos;s hard for you to see it ,
but i &apos;m doing what &apos;s best for you .
that &apos;s what you wanted when you brought me to storybrooke .
but the curse--
you &apos;re the only chance to bring back the happy endings .
henry .
henry !
henry .
what were you doing ? ! you could &apos;ve gotten us killed !
please ! please don &apos;t make me go !
we can &apos;t go !
everything &apos;s here ...
me , your parents , your family .
please , emma . they need you .
your family needs you .
did you really think that i would let you get away ?
you appear to have had quite the adventure since then .
whatever it is you &apos;re gonna do to me ,
get on with it .
i took you in as my son ,
and you betrayed me .
i would &apos;ve given you everything--
the crown , the kingdom .
all you had to do was marry king midas &apos; daughter .
but you decided to follow &quot; true love . &quot;
losing my life for love--
that &apos;s a sacrifice i am happy to make .
as you wish .
release the blade .
what is the meaning of this ?
sorry to drop in on you .
regina .
what do you want ?
i want the man you pretend is your son ,
and i &apos;m prepared to pay any riches midas promised you
in return for him .
what do you plan to do to him ?
oh , i promise he &apos;ll suffer ...
far more than some swift and simple beheading .
how ?
by using him
to destroy his one true love .
by using him to bring an end to snow white .
your majesty . to what do i owe the pleasure ?
my tree is dying .
why ?
perhaps it &apos;s your fertilizer .
you think this is funny ?
well , i &apos;ll tell you what i think .
i think it &apos;s a sign of the curse weakening
because of emma .
but do you care ?
no .
you &apos;re content to just sit back and do ...
whatever it is you &apos;re doing
while all my hard work burns .
that &apos;s not all , is it ?
come on . you might as well get everything off your chest .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
henry .
ms. swan wants him .
she &apos;ll have that boy over my dead body .
the curse was meant to
take away snow white and prince charming &apos;s happiness .
perhaps you giving up henry is
just the price to keep the curse unbroken .
i think i &apos;d rather just get rid of her .
you &apos;re gonna have to be quite creative .
we both know the repercussions in killing ms. swan .
the curse will be broken .
the curse will be broken .
that &apos;s because you designed it that way .
undo it .
you know ...
even if i wanted to , i couldn &apos;t .
magic ...
is in short supply around here
and dwindling by the minute .
you want the curse broken .
why ?
that &apos;s not something i care to discuss .
don &apos;t bother . you can shove your reasons .
i want to strike a new deal .
one where i can get rid of emma without shattering the curse .
unfortunately for you ,
a negotiation requires two interested parties ,
and i &apos;m already planning a trip .
i &apos;ll give you anything .
you no longer have anything i want , dearie .
but i will give you a piece of advice , free of charge--
i &apos;d plan a trip of your own ,
because once people waken up
and remember who you are
and what you did to them ?
they are gonna be looking for blood .
佩奇
thought you &apos;d left .
mary margaret--
but i couldn &apos;t tell for sure
because you didn &apos;t bother to say good @-@ bye .
do you remember when i left ?
when i ran ? what you said to me ?
you said , we have to stick together ,
that we &apos;re like ...
family .
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry . i shouldn &apos;t have left .
you &apos;re right . you shouldn &apos;t have .
so why , after everything , did you just go ?
i don &apos;t wanna be sheriff . i don &apos;t want people relying on me .
i don &apos;t want this , any of it .
what about henry ?
i took him with me .
you abducted him ?
maybe .
so you don &apos;t want people to rely on you ,
but you took your son ?
now that sounds like a stable home for him .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
i want what &apos;s best for him .
and running is what &apos;s best for him ?
or is that what &apos;s best for you ?
you &apos;re reverting , emma ,
into the person you were before you got here ,
and i thought you &apos;d changed .
you thought wrong .
well , regardless ,
you have to do what &apos;s right for henry now .
what &apos;s that ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re his mother .
that &apos;s your job .
so you figure it out .
if we &apos;re going to get him out ,
we &apos;re going to have to get over that wall .
there &apos;s a soldier on every parapet .
we &apos;re gonna need some air support .
air ? i know just the person who can help us ,
someone who owes me a favor .
don &apos;t shoot . it &apos;s only me .
uh , red , you know , you got someone on your chin .
sorry .
what were you able to find out ?
your prince is still alive .
then why don &apos;t you look happy ?
because i also heard word the queen is here .
she knew i &apos;d come for him .
it &apos;s a trap .
indeed . it matters not .
i can &apos;t stop now .
but i &apos;ll understand if any of you want to turn back .
no !
not a chance !
oh . well , then there &apos;s no time to waste .
why is the queen doing this ?
i destroyed her happiness ,
and now she wants to destroy mine .
leave us .
what do you want ?
i suppose i see the allure .
i wonder if you &apos;ll be quite so incorruptible
after your precious snow is gone .
whatever she did to you ,
leave her alone and take my life instead .
oh , who said anything about taking her life ?
oh , no .
i have a far more satisfying brand of punishment for her .
jefferson .
so you got my message .
how could i miss it ?
you know i watch her .
it must be so painful ,
your daughter paige being oh , so near .
grace . her name is grace .
you should know that . you changed it .
what do you want ?
your help .
and what makes you think
i won &apos;t kill you after everything you &apos;ve done ?
because you don &apos;t have it in you .
if you did , you would have done it 28 years ago ,
when i brought you here .
because you know if i &apos;m dead ,
you &apos;ll never get back to your daughter .
and i have a way for us to both get what we want .
my hat .
i want you to use it again .
i can &apos;t make it work .
no one can .
not here . not without magic .
well , then you &apos;re in luck , because i happen to have some .
not a lot ...
but hopefully , enough ...
for one last journey .
where ?
back to our land ,
where there &apos;s a solution to a very delicate problem i have--
how to get rid of the one person who could break my curse .
emma .
and why shouldn &apos;t i let her do just that ?
end the madness and go home .
to your hovel ?
selling fungus at the fair ?
why ?
when you could just stay here in the mansion i gave you ?
my problem , jefferson ,
is the same as yours .
it &apos;s family .
we both want our children back ,
and we both can get them ,
if we work together .
why should i trust you now ?
you shouldn &apos;t .
but it &apos;s the only offer you &apos;ve got .
after we &apos;re through , i &apos;ll wake up your dear grace
so she remembers who you are .
no .
remembering is the worst curse--
two lives in her head , like me .
i want to forget .
i want you to write us a new story ,
a fresh start ,
here .
well , my dear jefferson , then that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ll have .
after we take care of ms. swan .
thank you , red .
do it .
move out .
i miss stealthy .
we &apos;re a go !
fairies ! attack !
let &apos;s go !
hang on .
august , please , i need your help .
emma wants to leave .
what ? slow down .
you were gonna make her believe . you have to .
i know , henry .
i &apos;m sorry . i ...
i failed .
failed ?
i tried to show her .
at first it was my legs ,
and now ...
now take a look ...
at the unvarnished truth .
it &apos;s wood .
yes .
all of this ...
i was right . the curse--it &apos;s real !
you &apos;re a smart kid .
and you &apos;re pinocchio .
what gave it away ?
but why are you turning back to wood ?
your story--
you should be real .
i &apos;m changing back because ...
i haven &apos;t exactly been a good boy .
and ...
well ...
if the curse doesn &apos;t break ,
this doesn &apos;t stop .
so we show emma that you &apos;re turning back
into the puppet you were , and then she has to believe ,
and when she does , she could break the curse .
i tried that .
she doesn &apos;t want to see , so she doesn &apos;t .
there &apos;s nothing more that i can do .
i @-@ i &apos;m getting tired .
it &apos;s hard to ride and it &apos;s hard to walk .
soon it &apos;s gonna be hard to breathe .
so we have to do something fast .
but there &apos;s nothing to do .
and with what little time i have left ,
i want to spend it with my father .
marco .
told you you &apos;re a smart kid .
so everyone &apos;s giving up .
i &apos;m afraid that i don &apos;t have a choice .
i &apos;m sorry , kid , but i &apos;m out of operation cobra .
now it &apos;s up to you .
emma , i &apos;m sorry ,
but i &apos;m afraid you don &apos;t have any case for custody .
even after everything she &apos;s done ?
which you can &apos;t prove .
let me just ask you a question .
with this war raging on , who really is getting hurt here ?
i know . henry .
but isn &apos;t it a good thing that he &apos;s spending time with me ?
i &apos;m his mother .
yes , you are ,
and so is regina .
and l @-@ look , the court is gonna come in and look at him
and see how he &apos;s been since you &apos;ve come into his life .
and he &apos;s been happier , right ?
maybe . i mean , objectively ?
he &apos;s skipped school , he &apos;s stolen a credit card ,
he &apos;s run off , he &apos;s--he &apos;s endangered himself ,
repeatedly .
and so in the eyes of the law , it &apos;s not so--
what about in your eyes ? what do you think ?
i mean , a while ago , i told you to engage him
in his fantasy life , and @-@ and perhaps i was wrong ,
because he &apos;s only retreated further into it .
you think he &apos;s better off with her ?
i never said that .
do you think that she would ever hurt him ?
no .
never .
i mean , everyone else , but not him .
look , right or wrong , her actions have all been defensive .
i &apos;m not judging , but ...
in many ways , your arrival has woke a sleeping dragon .
tell me honestly .
has he been better off since i got here ?
it &apos;s not a matter of better off .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s a matter of this war has to end .
if you two are gonna be in his life ,
you have to figure out the best way to do that .
charming .
charming .
snow .
you &apos;re ...
no .
no .
oh , no !
the queen took me to her palace .
but i &apos;m rescuing you .
snow .
is this always gonna be our life ?
taking turns finding each other ?
we &apos;ll be together . i know it .
have faith .
i just had to stop you .
i have no interest in cleaning tongue marks off my mirror .
let him go .
your fight is with me .
my thoughts exactly .
have you ever heard of a parley ?
we break off all this messy fighting and have a little talk ,
just you and me .
come unarmed .
where do i meet you ?
where it all began .
stop trying to talk me out of this .
the castle is secure . i &apos;m going .
keep the little knife between your tuffets .
i promised i would come alone and unarmed .
it &apos;s a parley . there are rules .
you &apos;re too noble for your own good .
i &apos;m not , but enough of you have risked your lives
because of something that &apos;s between the queen and me .
i will not let anyone else get hurt because of me .
except you .
thank you for your concern , but this ends today .
we can &apos;t let you go .
i &apos;m not asking .
thank you for your support .
i love each and every one of you ,
but this is something i have to do ...
alone .
i don &apos;t like this .
i don &apos;t trust that queen .
watch your step .
what is this place ?
where i &apos;ve kept the last bit of my magic .
the only magic in this world
is in the things i brought with me .
it &apos;s not spinning .
it &apos;s not working .
it needs to absorb the magic that &apos;s here .
i have some things left ,
a few trinkets .
it &apos;s not enough . you need something that still works .
who &apos;s that ?
someone long gone .
well , whatever or whoever it is ,
it still has magical properties .
give me that , and let me see what i can do with it .
if you want your son back ,
if you want your revenge , give it to me .
what &apos;s wrong ?
why isn &apos;t it opening a portal ?
the magic--it &apos;s not enough .
we can &apos;t go anywhere .
then you &apos;ve failed .
maybe not .
there &apos;s enough magic to touch the other side ,
just not to get us there .
there might be enough to ...
reach through and retrieve something .
i can bring something back ?
is there an object that can help you ?
perhaps i can open it enough and reach through and grab it .
it would have to be small ,
something that you can take with your hand .
is there anything like that that can help you ?
yes .
yes , i believe there is .
then you need to direct me to the time and place
where this object exists .
how ?
think about it .
guide the hat .
excellent .
it appears to be working .
now what is it we &apos;re after ?
an apple .
hello , regina .
follow me .
do you remember when i ran down your runaway horse , snow ?
do you remember when i saved your life ?
of course .
it all looks the same .
not quite .
this is new .
is that ...
a grave .
daniel &apos;s grave .
daniel ? i thought--
he ran away ?
i told you that
to spare your feelings out of ... kindness ,
but he died because of you .
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry , too ,
but nothing can change what happened ,
what you did .
you promised to keep my secret .
you promised , but you lied .
i was very young , and your mother--
she ripped his heart out because of you ,
because you couldn &apos;t listen to me !
you took my father .
haven &apos;t we both suffered enough ?
no .
what is that ?
it &apos;s just a morsel .
did you know that apples stand for health and wisdom ?
so why do i get the feeling that one might kill me ?
it won &apos;t kill you .
no , what it will do is far worse .
your body will be your tomb , and you &apos;ll be in there
with nothing but dreams formed of your own regrets .
and you &apos;re going to force me to eat it .
no .
of course not .
it wouldn &apos;t work anyway .
the choice is yours .
it must be taken willingly .
and why would i do that ?
because if you refuse the apple ,
your prince , your charming
will be killed .
no .
as i said , the choice is yours .
i take that apple , and he lives ?
that &apos;s the deal you want to make ?
with all my heart .
then congratulations .
you &apos;ve won .
snow .
what have you done to her ? !
what have you done ? !
snow !
is this it ?
yes .
yes , it is .
and my daughter , my grace ?
first things first .
the deal &apos;s not done ,
not until i solve the next conundrum--
how to get this savior
to taste my forbidden fruit .
we need to talk .
yes , i imagine we do .
i was just about to call you , too .
come right in .
do what you &apos;re so skilled at and make yourself at home .
i believe you came to see me .
right . look , this isn &apos;t easy .
i think that this ...
whatever is between us needs to end .
at last , something we can agree on .
i want to make a deal with you about henry .
i &apos;m not making any deals with you .
i &apos;m leaving town .
what ?
this ...
what we &apos;re doing is a problem ,
and i &apos;m gonna go , but i have conditions .
i still get to see henry . i get to visit
and spend time , whatever .
and you get to see him . you &apos;re still in his life .
look , in any deal , both parties are a little unhappy .
but let &apos;s be honest .
we both know
the world where i &apos;m not in his life no longer exists ,
and there &apos;s no one who can do anything about that .
you &apos;re right .
would you mind following me for a moment ?
so what are you proposing ?
i don &apos;t know .
just figure it out as we go .
but he &apos;s my son .
yeah .
oh , ms. swan ?
maybe a little something for the road ?
thanks .
if we &apos;re going to be in each other &apos;s lives ,
it &apos;s time we start being cordial .
my famous turnovers .
old recipe .
but delicious .
thank you .
i do hope you like apples .
snow was here . i can smell it .
snow ! snow !
she &apos;s over here !
i found her lying here like this . is she--
granny , give me your dagger .
maybe she &apos;s just sleeping .
she has no breath .
she &apos;s gone .
she sacrificed herself for true love .
she sacrificed herself for all of us .
it would appear sacrifice is overrated .
speaking of ...
snow !
what have you done to her ? !
what have you done ? !
i hope you bought travel insurance ,
because no one &apos;s going anywhere .
oh , really ?
and why &apos;s that ?
because i found a solution to my emma swan problem .
oh , yes ?
an old reliable solution .
a sleeping curse .
might i ask how you managed to obtain one here in storybrooke ?
by sacrificing the last bit of magic i had left .
so you made magic from magic .
well , i &apos;m sure i don &apos;t have to remind you that ,
all magic comes with a price .
then you can pay it .
because now ...
the curse is gonna be stronger than ever ,
and you will be right here where you belong .
don &apos;t you understand ?
i won .
so whatever plan you had ...
whatever reason you wanted the curse broken ?
too bad .
because it &apos;s never going to happen .
hey , emma . everything okay ?
you sounded strange over the walkie .
no , i &apos;m okay .
just , um ...
yesterday when i tried to take you away ,
you were right .
i can &apos;t take you out of storybrooke .
but i can &apos;t stay either .
what ?
i have to go .
go ? you mean leave storybrooke ?
yeah . i spoke to regina , and we made a deal .
i &apos;m still gonna be able to see you , just not ...
every day .
no ! no , you can &apos;t trust her .
i have to . it &apos;s my only choice .
it &apos;s what &apos;s best for you , henry .
every time i fight her , someone else gets hurt .
no , no , no !
you &apos;re just scared .
this happens to all heroes .
it &apos;s just the low moment before you fight back .
henry ! this isn &apos;t a story .
this is reality .
and things have to change .
you can &apos;t skip school .
you can &apos;t run away , and ...
you can &apos;t believe in curses .
y @-@ you really don &apos;t believe ?
i ...
this is how it has to be right now .
i made a deal ,
and i used my super power . she &apos;s telling the truth .
she &apos;s gonna take really good care of you .
yes , but she wants you dead .
come on , henry !
you &apos;re the only one that can stop her .
stop her from what ?
all she &apos;s ever done is fight for you .
this just ...
got out of hand .
i &apos;m sorry .
where did you get that ?
regina gave it to me .
apple !
so ?
you can &apos;t eat that . it &apos;s poison .
what ?
don &apos;t you see ?
the deal--it was all a trick to get you to eat that ,
to get rid of the savior .
henry , come on . why would she do that
when i just told her i was gonna go ?
because as long as you &apos;re alive , you &apos;re a threat to the curse .
henry , you &apos;ve gotta stop thinking like this .
but it &apos;s the truth !
and you leaving isn &apos;t gonna change that .
i &apos;ll prove it to you .
no !
henry ... what are you doing ?
i &apos;m sorry it had to come to this .
you may not believe in the curse ... or in me .
but i believe in you .
see ? you wanna have some ice cream with that ?
and then we can go back to talking about ...
henry ?
henry ? henry ? !
