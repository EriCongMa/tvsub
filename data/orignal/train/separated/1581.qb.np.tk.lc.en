he &apos;s been helping me .
that woman has lied
and threatened my family .
she &apos;s done horrible things .
&apos;cause she &apos;s sick .
i want no part of this .
brandon has something to tell you both .
it &apos;s about dani . we ... had sex .
am i seeing you tonight ?
oh , no , i have that dinner .
is emma gonna be there ?
this is a team dinner . she &apos;s not on the team .
it &apos;s my parents . they &apos;re getting a divorce .
how &apos;d it go ? the wrestling thing ?
i didn &apos;t even go .
what ? why ?
hayley stopped by . her parents are getting divorced .
hayley &apos;s known about this for months .
stop !
what &apos;s wrong ?
we tried to have sex . i freaked out .
like a panic attack .
i was raped .
i thought i put it behind me ,
but i have still have some stuff i have to work through .
take as long as you need .
please , we &apos;ll take care of everything
and we &apos;ll do all of the clean @-@ up .
it &apos;ll be like a night off .
we &apos;ll even let you have some leftovers .
can i ? well , that &apos;s so sweet .
please ?
what &apos;s happening ?
mariana &apos;s cooking dinner for everyone tomorrow night .
not for you .
great . i &apos;ll order pizza .
i thought you were going out with mat .
hayley and i are making dinner for mat and jesus .
good luck , bro .
wait a minute . i did not say yes .
please ? hayley &apos;s mom studied at the gordon blue .
it &apos;s cordon bleu .
whatever .
her mom &apos;s a great cook and she taught hayley everything .
but wait . how did you know that i was going out with mat ?
he asked if it was ok .
he sounds like a real gentleman .
see ? some people ask before they
hook up with people &apos;s best friends and sisters .
does mat know about this dinner ?
well , no , but ...
usually , when a guy asks you on a date ,
it means he wants to be alone with you .
she &apos;s scared of him .
i am not .
she is .
i &apos;m not scared of him !
so ?
yes . it &apos;s all right with me .
but only because you promised me leftovers .
yay ! gonna call hayley , plan the menu .
why is she scared of him ?
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m gonna say this ,
but my po just told me i get to go home next week .
right ? come on !
yeah , yeah . stop it .
cool !
yeah . and , um , things with my mom are , like ...
... pretty great , i guess .
she , like , apologized for
everything that happened when i was younger .
her boyfriends used to , like , mess with me and stuff ,
and when she didn &apos;t wanna deal with it ,
she would leave me with my grandma ,
who was getting high all the time .
anyways ...
... she , like , took responsibility for all of that ,
and she got a new apartment ,
and it has a bedroom in it for me .
so i think i &apos;m going home .
good for you , becka .
it &apos;s just amazing , becka , it really is .
you know , you have come such a long way
since you started here , really .
i mean , how proud are you right now of yourself ?
i &apos;m proud of you .
we have some more good news , actually . guess what ?
i got a call from the lgbt home in lemon grove ,
双性恋者bisexuals与跨性别者transgender的英文缩写
and guess who has a bed ?
what ?
yes .
you can move in the middle of the week .
come on , aren &apos;t you happy ?
yeah . no , totally . i ...
i &apos;m just surprised is all . i ...
... never thought it would happen .
well , just goes to show you , you keep after something ,
you just might get it .
and speaking of sticking with it , look who &apos;s back here .
callie has agreed to come and help us out for community day .
i &apos;m assuming that &apos;s cool with everyone ? yes ?
cool with me .
yeah , i think that &apos;s great .
what , no snarky comment ? becka , what happened to you ?
carmen , good ?
sure . i mean , if you &apos;re crazy enough to come back .
rest of you guys ? come on . kiara ?
yeah , cool .
devonee ?
actually , dev , you know what ?
callie knows everyone else here , but she doesn &apos;t really know you .
why don &apos;t you tell her a little about yourself ?
i &apos;m 16 . i come from riverside .
my mom &apos;s a crackhead so i been on my own most of my life .
i got busted for , um , selling drugs , vandalism ,
oh , and stealing .
i been to juvie four times , and this is my third group home .
and i wish they would sent me to the last one i was in ,
&apos;cause they didn &apos;t have so many rules and things .
listen , i get that when you &apos;ve been on your own for a long time ,
it &apos;s really hard to deal with the rules and expectations .
but guess what ? that &apos;s what it takes
to be a productive member of society . ok ?
this is stuff that your parents should have taught you ,
but as we know , that doesn &apos;t always happen .
i just don &apos;t understand
why everyone can &apos;t just do what they want .
i mean , it &apos;s a free country , right ?
yeah , and i understand that you don &apos;t get it .
and that &apos;s why you &apos;re here , to figure it out . right , callie ?
right .
hey , callie , um , would you wanna like ,
bunk with me this weekend ?
i thought you had a roommate .
yeah . devonee hates me though ,
so i &apos;m sure she &apos;d , like ,
love an excuse to take the empty bed in cole &apos;s room .
um , well , thanks but i don &apos;t wanna hurt cole &apos;s feelings .
yeah . we were roommates before
and i kinda wanna be in my old room , anyway .
ok , yeah , no worries .
hey , becka , um , i &apos;m super impressed with how well you &apos;re doing .
it &apos;s really great to see .
i &apos;m not cutting anymore , either .
that &apos;s good .
um , i &apos;m gonna ...
could you stay in becka &apos;s room this weekend ?
i mean , would you mind ?
uh , no . that &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m gonna go check on the laundry .
what &apos;s so funny ?
mama .
she and jude just got to the campsite
and she sent me this picture of the outhouse .
that &apos;s messed up .
hey . mama tells me that you and ...
you and hayley are having sex .
we &apos;re using condoms .
well , good . you better be .
that &apos;s not what i want to talk to you about .
do we really have to have this talk ?
we do .
you guys just started seeing each other ,
and , you know , sex is a big deal . it &apos;s a big step .
i know .
i just want to make sure
that you &apos;re respectful , jesus , and honest .
i am . i &apos;m really nice to her .
yeah ? like you were with emma ?
emma broke up with me .
ok .
but , uh , you moved on pretty fast .
you &apos;re already having sex .
i , uh , i just ...
... just wanna make sure that
you &apos;re not getting in over your head , jesus ,
and ... and feeling like you &apos;re obligated before you &apos;re ready .
that &apos;s all . enough said .
ok .
ok . get out of here .
go do some homework . there &apos;s an idea .
so , uh , what &apos;s devonee &apos;s story ?
she crazy , that one .
seems like cole is kinda into her .
he &apos;s into her in more ways than one , you know what i mean ?
devonee &apos;s gay ?
gay for the stay , more like it .
what ?
it happens all the time .
lots of straight girls get a little while they &apos;re here .
but i guess since cole identifies as a boy ,
that means devonee &apos;s ...
don &apos;t ask me .
does rita know ?
there &apos;s lots of underground stuff going on right now
that rita doesn &apos;t know about ,
or at least she pretends she don &apos;t .
um , how many chairs did rita ?
fifteen .
so your foster family fell through ?
becka told me . i &apos;m really sorry .
me too .
i &apos;m getting out soon and i got no place to go .
not like you .
what does that mean ?
i can &apos;t find one family that wants me . you got two .
the quinns ? they don &apos;t want me to live with them .
and even if they did , i ...
you wouldn &apos;t want to live with them ? why not ?
i barely know them .
well you barely knew the fosters six months ago
and they &apos;re not even blood .
ok , sure .
what about my brother ?
he got adopted without you .
because i made him .
ok , i get that you are disappointed
because your foster family didn &apos;t work out ,
but why are you being a jerk ?
why are you even here ?
i know you didn &apos;t come back for the bad food or the lumpy beds .
演唱者 tweens
sorry , didn &apos;t mean to startle you .
it &apos;s ok .
you &apos;re not going out tonight ?
oh , no .
any plans for the weekend ?
no .
i just , i think i &apos;m gonna stay in .
you could always crash your sister &apos;s dinner party .
oh ... no , thanks .
have you , uh , talked to your dad ?
not really , no . i mean , you know , a little bit .
you know that he doesn &apos;t blame you ...
... for what happened with dani , right ?
yeah . i know .
think you may ever wanna talk with someone ?
like a therapist ?
yeah .
no .
well , think about it . ok ?
you don &apos;t have to blame yourself either . you know that ?
ok ?
yeah . i know .
i &apos;m fine .
good evening , steve . how are you ?
my motion detector light went off again .
i know .
and my dog was barking like a maniac .
that is not news to us .
we hear your dog barking every day night .
if the girls keep trespassing , i am gonna call the cops .
well , if you keep harassing us
every time a squirrel runs through your bushes ,
i &apos;m gonna call the cops .
my garage has been broken into twice .
i know , steve , you have told me , more than twice .
listen , we &apos;re having an open house tomorrow .
why don &apos;t you just come by , ok ?
why don &apos;t you meet the girls ,
see that work that we actually do here .
i think you &apos;ll be pleasantly surprised .
i wouldn &apos;t count on it .
you have a wonderful evening . ok ?
i am gonna get you outta this house ! one way or another !
callie , i &apos;m sorry you had to hear that .
i didn &apos;t know you were in here .
they &apos;re not ...
he &apos;s not really trying to get you guys shut down , is he ?
can he do that ?
our lease is up .
he &apos;s got all the neighbors in a frenzy ,
and they &apos;re putting pressure on the landlord not to renew .
what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna fight it .
what else can i do ? it &apos;s not that easy
to get a landlord to rent to a group home .
and we don &apos;t have the money to buy our own .
we gotta convince the neighbors
that having us here is actually a good thing .
hence , community day .
girls united , it &apos;s not gonna go away , is it ?
not if i have any say in it .
oh , my god !
sorry .
no , it &apos;s ok . um ... some guy just ran through the gates .
i &apos;m gonna go get rita .
wait . hang on .
i know who it was .
a double @-@ date dinner party ?
wow . that &apos;s fancy .
i know , right ?
becoming quite the grown @-@ ups all of a sudden .
so how is it ? ready to kill yourself yet ?
death by seventh @-@ graders ?
no . no .
the kids are really great . jude is having a blast .
it &apos;s really ... it &apos;s really nice
to see him getting more and more adjusted .
good .
and it &apos;s , um ...
it &apos;s been good for me , too .
you know , being out here in nature ,
the mountains and the trees .
being able to actually see the stars .
it &apos;s a good reminder , you know ?
of what ?
of the circle of life .
you know , how nothing is permanent ,
not the trees , not the mountains , not us .
not even our sadness .
i can keep ...
i keep thinking about the fact that ,
no matter what happens during the night ,
every morning the sun comes up ,
again and again , you know ?
i love you .
i love you , too .
so , anything else ?
um , well , we , uh , got a letter from ana .
what ?
she wants to see the twins ,
to &quot; make amends . &quot;
what did you do ?
well , i called mike and told him that
she &apos;s never coming anywhere near our kids , ever again .
good .
so , um , devonee told me you &apos;re using street hormones again .
seriously ? after you had a seizure ? listen , ok .
i won &apos;t say anything , all right , on one condition .
you have to promise me you will throw them away , ok ?
you &apos;re gonna be in the new house in less than a week
and you can see a doctor as soon as you get there . deal ?

so i worked the program here at girls united really hard ,
and was able to go back to my current home .
it was really important that i was here , you know ,
to ... to get me on the right track .
but what about gangs ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
well , steve was telling me
that some of the girls are in gangs .
should i be worried about drive @-@ bys ?
shootings .
oh , i don &apos;t think that that &apos;s ...
hi . i &apos;m rita . met you at the front door .
actually , we have a wonderful relationship
with the police department .
they do extra patrols in the neighborhood .
so , contrary to what steve has said ,
crime &apos;s actually gone down since we &apos;ve been here .
excuse me , i &apos;m just gonna refill this .
sure , callie .
can i show you some information ?
callie ? um , mom , this is callie .
callie , this is my mom , belinda .
hi .
nice to meet you , callie .
callie &apos;s the one i was telling you about , remember ?
she &apos;s the one who got out , and is doing really good .
oh . how nice .
yeah . it was ...
it was really inspiring .
i &apos;m just , i &apos;m happy that becka gets to go home soon .
not as happy as me .
um , excuse me , but ...
so guess what ?
i met a guy . and i know what you &apos;re gonna say ,
but i promise , he &apos;s really great .
i promise .
i &apos;m telling you , it wasn &apos;t there !
someone stole it , and i &apos;m pretty sure that it ...
man , these people can talk .
that &apos;s saying something , coming from you .
come on , we should ...
i don &apos;t wanna go back out there .
oh , yeah ? rather stay in here and talk to me instead ?
get down !
stay inside !
where &apos;d it come from ?
get down !
hey !
hi . um , i &apos;m lou . i &apos;m in the band with brandon .
yeah . yeah . i know . why don &apos;t you come on in ? how you doing ?
good , thank you .
good , good . what &apos;s going on ?
i just wanted to drop this off for brandon .
will you give it to him ?
oh , he &apos;s here .
really ?
yeah . why don &apos;t you take it up to him yourself ?
uh , i don &apos;t want to bother him .
oh , no , he needs to be bothered . trust me .
go ahead .
ok .
look , i know everybody &apos;s a little bit on edge ,
but i gotta say i think we did a lot of good today .
you know ? we made connections with the neighbors .
in fact , one guy from down the block said he &apos;s gonna give us
his old lawnmower tomorrow , so ...
who do you think threw those firecrackers ? the guy next door ?
i think we ought to start harassing him right back .
i might just have to play
a little gangsta rap at three in the morning ,
you know what i mean ?
we don &apos;t know that steve was the one who did that .
you know ? it could have just been some kids trying to be funny .
hilarious .
i &apos;m sorry , do you have a problem ?
if you have something to say , you should say it .
i just think you &apos;re fake , is all .
why do you say that ?
look ,
i get why you want all the neighbors
to meet the pretty white girl who
made good after being in here for like 15 minutes ,
but do we have to pretend
that she &apos;s like jehovah come back to save us ?
she &apos;s not some amazing success story ,
&apos;cause she never had any real stuff to deal
with in the first place .
shut up , devonee ! you don &apos;t know what you talking about !
why you gotta be such a ...
kiara , easy .
well , she &apos;s making me mad !
i know .
but you know a better way to express your anger .
i &apos;m sorry , but i don &apos;t think
you should talk about things you don &apos;t understand .
that &apos;s better .
callie , what would you like to say ?
nothing .
what is this ?
vichyssoise .
what &apos;s in it ?
potatoes , leeks and chicken stock .
what ?
um , it &apos;s cold .
oh , should we microwave it ?
it &apos;s supposed to be cold .
it &apos;s not bad for cold soup .
it &apos;s really good . where &apos;d you learn how to cook like this ?
oh . her mom &apos;s like a fancy chef .
so that &apos;s where you get it from .
how about you ? do you like to cook ?
uh ...
she likes to eat .
i should probably try to learn .
if cooking was genetic , mariana would be in trouble .
the only thing our birth mom knew how to cook was crack .
i thought you said you didn &apos;t know anything about your birth mother .
well , it &apos;s not like we grew up with her .
we were with her until we were , like , five .
can we change the subject , jesus ?
i can &apos;t believe you lied to me .
what , like you lied about your parents getting divorced ?
my parents are getting divorced .
which you &apos;ve known about for months .
mariana !
what ? you made it seem like you
just found out so jesus would miss his team dinner .
that &apos;s not true ! i was upset ...
yeah , that emma was going to be there !
is that what you think ?
fine . you know what ?
hayley , wait ! don &apos;t ! where are you ... ?
nice job .
演唱者 renald francoeur
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s ok .
i ... i should probably ...
hey , you ...
my dad , he took off when i was six .
it &apos;s not something i tell a lot of people .
it &apos;s not really any of their business , you know ?
we should have gone out alone .
hey , so , um , i think i &apos;m gonna go home .
really ?
yeah .
you know , community day &apos;s over , and ...
well , if that &apos;s really what you came for .
i mean , you know , community day is just
for a couple hours in the afternoon .
you could have just swung by ,
but instead you decided to spend the whole weekend with us .
why was that , callie ?
if you &apos;re ready to go , go .
and if not ...
... stay .
nice .
you like ?
i thought maybe we could use
a little bit of this vibe in some of our songs .
what ?
nothing .
love songs . they &apos;re just ... funny , when you think about it .
how so ?
just all the &quot; you &apos;re the only one ,
i &apos;ll die without you &quot; crap .
it &apos;s so weird how everyone writes like that .
why ?
do you believe that stuff ?
&quot; i &apos;ll die without you &quot; ?
no .
i guess not .
but i do think that ... we &apos;re all looking for someone who gets us .
and , you know , once we find that person ,
you just really , really wanna hang onto them , you know ?
yeah , but you can &apos;t hang on to people .
people aren &apos;t things . it doesn &apos;t work like that .
tell me about it .
oh , i love this part .

i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;re you doing here ?
on a saturday night ?
i ... i should probably take off . i &apos;ve got plans .
see you .
sorry .
it &apos;s ok .
i wanted to say thank you for shutting up devonee in group .
you &apos;re right , you know .
i didn &apos;t come back just for the lumpy beds .
and i sure as hell didn &apos;t come back to be some sort of
&quot; success story , &quot; you know ?
if anything , it just makes me feel worse ,
pretending like i &apos;ve got it all together .
i &apos;m sorry i was being such a bitch .
i &apos;m having a hard time right now .
you &apos;re allowed .
but what &apos;s going on with you ? is it wyatt ?
how &apos;d you know ?
you haven &apos;t talked about him the whole time you &apos;ve been here .
um , we &apos;re kinda taking a break .
taking a break ? why ?
how long did it take you to have sex after , you know ...
what ? after i was raped ?
yeah .
well , i only been with one guy since ,
but we was high most of the time , so i &apos;m not sure that counts .
you having trouble being with wyatt ?
i just thought i was over it .
i don &apos;t wanna be dealing with this anymore .
girl , you ain &apos;t over it till you &apos;re over it .
you gotta get some help .
and i don &apos;t think hiding out from your boyfriend
with a bunch a troublemakers is where you &apos;re gonna find it .
where is it ?
what ?
the stuff the guy left in the yard .
wait , cole threw it out , right ?
i thought it was his hormones .
well , now you know it wasn &apos;t . so give it .
i don &apos;t have it .
this ain &apos;t over .
get out .
where is dev ?
i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
well , i came in because i wanted to talk to you about devonee .
and then you went through my stuff ? nice .
no , then i saw your backpack .
yeah , i know what running away looks like , cole .
i &apos;m kinda good at it , remember ?
fine .
we &apos;re leaving .
why ?
we have to . they &apos;re gonna send me to a different home .
so ? i thought that &apos;s what you wanted .
so , we wanna be together .
she &apos;s just using you , cole , for drugs .
she loves me .
devonee &apos;s not gay .
neither am i !
ok , no . no , you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry , i get it . i do .
that &apos;s why i have to get out of this place ,
because no one here treats me like a man .
ok , but they will at this new home , right ?
the lgbt one ?
yeah .
they &apos;ll get you counseling , doctors , hormones .
legal , safe hormones .
if devonee loves you , if she really loves you ,
she will want you to go to this home .
and she &apos;ll wait for you ...
... to become the man you &apos;re supposed to be . right ?
i guess maybe i was a little jealous of emma .
you know , i saw you guys
wrestling and i think i was ... i was just scared .
that maybe you &apos;d hook up after the team dinner or something .
you don &apos;t have to worry about that . i &apos;m with you .
i know , but we sort of started this with sex ,
and we haven &apos;t really even been on a date .
that &apos;s why i wanted to make dinner for you tonight .
i just wanted to , like , impress you .
but i already think you &apos;re awesome .
i love how you make me feel .
yeah ? how &apos;s that ?
i don &apos;t know ... safe .
you take care of me .
i like that .
i like that , too .
maybe you could plan a date for us tomorrow .
i really have to study tomorrow .
right .
well , i ruined tonight , so ... i don &apos;t blame you .
i guess i can study another night .
really ?
yeah .
sweet .
then let &apos;s plan something really special , ok ?
so what was in the bag ? coke ? crystal ?
crystal .
that bitch callie stole it , and i want it back .
i want my stuff !
well , i don &apos;t have it .
i ...
i don &apos;t wanna leave tonight .
because of her ?
no .
because i don &apos;t wanna be on the streets again .
and i wanna go to that home in lemon grove .
why ? so you can become a boy ?
yeah .
well , let me tell you something . you &apos;re never gonna be a boy ,
you &apos;re never gonna be nothing but a freak .
what &apos;d you think , that we were
gonna run away together and live happily ever after ?
i was just trying to get to bakersfield ,
where my real boyfriend is , ok ?
and i don &apos;t need you for that .
get out .
oh , i &apos;m going .
and you best
not to come back &apos; cause you ain &apos;t welcome here .
oh , you don &apos;t have to worry about that .
i &apos;m leaving tonight ,
and y &apos;all never gonna see me again .
i hope ya &apos;ll light sleepers .
hayley go home ?
yeah .
hey , uh , so listen , you didn &apos;t go to your team dinner ?
i wasn &apos;t eavesdropping .
i was in the kitchen while you were having dinner .
i still got the award .
and you didn &apos;t go because ...
hayley was really upset . i needed to stay with her .
mm @-@ hmm . sounds a little like you were being manipulated .
but ... just an observation .
well , you can keep your observations to yourself .
excuse me ? you don &apos;t have to get angry .
i am angry .
i really like her . she &apos;s really great .
i &apos;m sorry she &apos;s not emma . i know you loved emma ,
but you don &apos;t have to like hayley , you &apos;re not the one dating her .
ok . i just don &apos;t want to see
you sacrificing things that are important to you
in order to take care of a girl .
well , i &apos;m not . ok ? are we done ?
yes .
she left .
i &apos;m really sorry .
i &apos;m so stupid . i could have blown everything .
but you didn &apos;t .
will anyone ever love me ?
i do .
you know what i mean .
will anyone ever love a freak ?
you &apos;re not a freak .
you just know who you are .
and you have the courage to go through
with what you have to
to , you know , make yourself the person you wanna be .
that &apos;s more than a lot of us can say .
you &apos;re not the person you wanna be ?
i &apos;m working on it .
you want me to stay in here tonight ?
no , we have to act like we don &apos;t know she &apos;s gone .
ok . try to get some sleep , yeah ?
