joe , that &apos;s why your parents told you not to jump on the bed !
the one with the jam
hey , look at me ! i &apos;m making jam !
i &apos;ve been at it since 4 a.m.
where &apos;d you get fruit at 4 a.m. ?
down at the docks . you know , you can get it wholesale .
i didn &apos;t know there were docks .
is it broken ?
no , but i gotta wear this for a couple weeks .
you tell the doctor you did it jumping on your bed ?
no . i had a whole story worked out , but then ...
... chandler sold me out .
i didn &apos;t think the doctor would buy that it &quot; fell out of the socket . &quot;
what is this ? fruit ?
monica &apos;s making jam .
jam ? i love jam ! how come we never have jam at our place ?
because the kids need new shoes .
i &apos;m going into business . i &apos;m sick of being depressed about richard .
i needed a plan . a plan to get over my man .
what &apos;s the opposite of man ? jam !
joey , don &apos;t ! it &apos;s way too hot !
this &apos;ll just be my batch .
that &apos;s it .
hey , you , j. crew guy ....
why are you following me ?
all week , everywhere i look , there &apos;s you .
you wouldn &apos;t return my calls . you sent back my letters .
one more chance , ursula . please .
this is awkward .
yeah , because you want ursula , and i &apos;m phoebe . twin sisters .
seriously .
that &apos;s great . i &apos;m stalking the wrong woman .
i am such a dingus !
oh , you &apos;re not a dingus .
i just want you to know i wasn &apos;t always like this .
before i met your sister , i was a normal guy who sold cellular phones .
look , it &apos;s not your fault .
i mean , this is just what she does to guys , okay ?
well , thanks .
wait . i got a little story .
once , in junior high school , i thought i was a witch .
and a guidance counselor told me something that might help you .
he said , &quot; okay , you &apos;re not a witch . you &apos;re just an average student . &quot;
see what i &apos;m saying ?
not really .
well , get over it .
you seem like a really nice guy .
don &apos;t be so hard on yourself , okay ?
you &apos;re right . i know you &apos;re right . and thanks for being so nice .
thanks a lot .
want to get some coffee ?
you don &apos;t have to walk behind me anymore .
&quot; gone for more jars . be back later . monica geller . &quot;
wait a minute . look !
it &apos;s an empty apartment .
we &apos;re all alone in an empty apartment .
i have to be at work in 10 minutes .
all right . it &apos;s not like i &apos;m employee of the year or anything .
there it is !
oh , that &apos;s what you mean .
do i look fat ?
no .
i accept that .
when janice asked me and i said no , she thought i was calling her a cow .
walk us through it , honey . walk us through it .
janice said , &quot; hi . do i look fat today ? &quot; and i looked at her
you looked at her ?
you never look .
you just answer . it &apos;s like a reflex . &quot; do i look fat ? &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
&quot; is she prettier than i am ? &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
&quot; does size matter ? &quot;
and it works both ways .
so you both just know this stuff ?
after 30 or 40 fights , you kind of catch on .
okay . for instance :
janice is coming back from a trip . she gives you two options .
option one : she &apos;ll take a cab home from the airport .
option two : you can meet her at baggage claim . what do you do ?
easy . baggage claim .
wrong ! now you &apos;re single .
it &apos;s actually secret option number three .
you meet her at the gate . that way she knows you love her .
okay , this is good .
all right , i have one . janice likes to cuddle ...
... at night , which i &apos;m all for .
but when you want to go to sleep , you want some space .
so how do i tell her that without ...
... you know , accidentally calling her fat or something ?
sorry , honey . we can &apos;t help you there , because we &apos;re cuddly sleepers .
i &apos;m late for work .
are you guys coming down ?
yeah . i &apos;m right behind you .
good luck , chandler .
thank you .
bye , sweetie .
bye , honey .
the sleeping thing .
very tricky business , but solvable .
i thought you were &quot; cuddly sleepers . &quot;
no , not cuddly . not me . just her .
i &apos;m like you . i need the room .
okay , come here .
okay . you &apos;re in bed .
i &apos;ll use the cushion .
okay . you &apos;re in bed . she &apos;s over on your side , cuddling .
now , you wait for her to drift off ...
... and then you hug her ...
... and roll her over to her side of the bed .
and then you ...
... roll away .
hug for her .
roll for you .
the old &quot; hug and roll . &quot;
one question . you &apos;re pretending the pillow &apos;s a girl , right ?
remember when you were a kid , your mom would send you to the movies ...
... with a jar of jam and a little spoon ?
you &apos;re so pretty .
you know that guy who &apos;s been following me ? i talked to him today .
you talked to him ? are you crazy ?
first , i &apos;m not crazy . and second , say it , don &apos;t spray it .
anyway , his name is malcolm , and he wasn &apos;t following me .
i mean , he was , but he thought i was ursula .
that &apos;s why he couldn &apos;t just come up and talk to me .
because of the restraining order .
not feeling better about malcolm .
no , no , he &apos;s not a kook .
he &apos;s just this very passionate , incredibly romantic guy ...
... that just got a teensy bit carried away .
we get along really well , and he &apos;s so cute .
oh , my god ! you &apos;ve got a crush on your sister &apos;s stalker .
i &apos;m going to help him get &quot; de @-@ ursula @-@ ized . &quot;
like i did for joey after he went out with her .
i didn &apos;t stalk her .
i asked for the news , not the weather .
joey , this is for you . it &apos;s blackberry currant .
joe , i got to ask .
the girl from the xerox place , buck naked ...
... or a big tub of jam ?
put your hands together .
take your time with that . it &apos;s my last batch .
no more jam ?
what happened to your jam plan ?
i figured out i &apos;d need to charge $ 17 a jar just to break even .
so i &apos;ve got a new plan now . babies .
well , you &apos;ll need much bigger jars .
what are you talking about ?
about me having a baby .
are you serious ?
yeah .
the jam plan helped me take control of my life .
so i thought , &quot; what is the most important thing to me ? &quot;
and that &apos;s when i came up with the baby plan .
aren &apos;t you forgetting something ?
what is that guy &apos;s name ? dad !
it took me 28 years to find a man i wanted to spend my life with .
if i have to wait another 28 years , i &apos;ll be 56 before i can have a baby .
and that &apos;s just stupid .
that &apos;s what &apos;s stupid ?
i don &apos;t need an actual man . just a few of his best swimmers .
and there are places you can go to get that ... stuff .
down to the docks again ?
night @-@ night , bing @-@ a @-@ ling .
night @-@ night ...
... janice .
look at all the room on her side !
a giant penguin could fit over there .
that &apos;d be weird , though .
hug and roll time .
i &apos;m hugging . i &apos;m hugging .
you &apos;re rolling , and ....
yes ! freedom !
except for this arm !
i &apos;m stuck . stuck arm .
time for the old tablecloth trick . one fluid motion .
quick like a cat .
and one , two ...
... three !
here &apos;s my binoculars .
oh , great . you &apos;re doing great .
going strong . ikeep going .
these are my night @-@ vision goggles .
this is the book i pretend to read when i &apos;m watching her in the park .
and these are madlibs . they &apos;re just for fun .
this is the log i kept , recording her every movement .
want to hear some of it ?
not even a little bit .
it &apos;s about you .
okay then .
&quot; l met phoebe today .
she was really nice to me even though i &apos;m such a loser .
and when i was walking home , i thought about her a lot .
it was weird , but kind of cool . &quot;
good .
so what were you thinking ?
i was thinking what it &apos;d be like to kiss you .
really ?
no .
that &apos;s just something i said now so that maybe i could kiss you .
oh , okay .
no , it &apos;s all right . i just had a jar of mustard .
okay . sperm donor number 03815 , come on down !
okay , he &apos;s 6 &apos; 2 , &quot; 170 pounds .
he describes himself as a male gina davis .
you mean there &apos;s more than one of us ?
you can &apos;t do this , mon . if you do this , i &apos;ll
you &apos;ll what ?
i &apos;ll tell mom .
i &apos;m sorry , but he &apos;s right . i love you , but you &apos;re crazy .
why ? why is this crazy ?
so this isn &apos;t the ideal way
oh , it &apos;s not
lips moving . still talking .
it may not be ideal , but ...
... i &apos;m so ready .
i see the way ben looks at you .
it makes me ache , you know ?
check it out ! jam crackers !
okay . all right , how &apos;s this ?
twenty @-@ seven , ltalian @-@ american guy .
he &apos;s an actor .
born in queens .
wow ! big family . seven sisters ...
... and he &apos;s the only ... boy .
oh , my god ! under personal comments : &quot; new york knicks rule . &quot;
yeah , the knicks rule !
joey , this is you !
let me see .
oh , right !
you went to a sperm bank ?
right after i did that sex study at nyu .
remember that sweater i gave you ?
that &apos;s how you bought it ?
no . that &apos;s what i was wearing when i donated .
i &apos;m surprised there &apos;s any of my boys left .
it is pretty competitive . there &apos;s an actual rocket scientist here .
maybe i should have them put my days of our lives gig on here .
juice this up a little .
how &apos;s the maniac ?
he &apos;s yummy . we did a little kissing .
phoebe , what are you doing ?
no , no . he &apos;s not into that anymore . he quit for me .
this guy has been obsessed with your sister for god knows how long .
you don &apos;t just give that up .
he gave me his night @-@ vision goggles and everything .
you &apos;re taking the word of a guy who has night @-@ vision goggles ?
he &apos;s not still following her . you think he &apos;s still following her ?
wake up and smell the restraining order .
what should i do ?
if you really like this guy , you should just trust him .
thank you , monica .
or you could follow him .
that &apos;s what i &apos;d do . forget mine .
what happened ?
crazy chandler spun me ...
... off the bed .
wow ! spinning ! sounds like fun .
i wish .
he was just trying ross &apos; &quot; hug and roll &quot; thing .
ross &apos; what ?
where he hugs you and then he rolls you away , and ....
oh ... my ... god !
what are you doing ?
oh , i was just here looking for my ... my ....
part of an old sandwich . here it is !
were you following me ?
perhaps .
yes . i &apos;m sorry .
i was afraid you were still hung up on my sister .
so you spied on me .
i can &apos;t believe you don &apos;t trust me .
well , what do you know ? there goes my identical twin sister !
just walking along , looking like me .
is this a freakish coincidence , or did you know she takes this train ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
i tried to stop , but i couldn &apos;t .
i &apos;m so pathetic .
no , it &apos;s not your fault . it &apos;s partly my fault .
i made you quit cold turkey .
well , i can &apos;t date you anymore because you &apos;re , you know ....
wow !
but i will definitely help you get over my sister . okay ?
stalk me for a while , huh ?
i &apos;ll be like an ursula patch .
i don &apos;t know .
just .... look , i &apos;m going !
come on .
i &apos;m on the pillar . which way will i go ?
where you going ?
to the bank .
sperm or regular ?
sperm .
you &apos;re really doing it ?
oh , yeah . i picked a guy . 37135 .
sounds nice .
he does . he &apos;s got brown hair and green eyes .
no kidding ?
i figured you &apos;d have picked a blond .
really ? why ?
i always pictured you with a tall , smart , blond guy with a name like ...
... hoyt .
it &apos;s a name . yeah .
i saw you in this great house with a big pool .
is he a swimmer ?
he &apos;s got the body for it .
i like that .
what ?
you have a sign that says :
&quot; we don &apos;t swim in your toilet . don &apos;t pee in our pool . &quot;
we don &apos;t have that sign .
you do ! it was a gift from me .
and you have three great kids .
two girls and a boy ?
and they wear little water wings , and they run around on the deck .
and hoyt wraps a towel around all three of them .
sure .
but , you know , this way sounds good too .
yeah .
wow ! this guy &apos;s an astronaut ?
that would have been cool ...
... for a day .
she &apos;ll be back at 5 .
five !
i called the sperm bank .
they haven &apos;t sold a single unit of tribbiani .
nobody wants my product .
i don &apos;t get it .
maybe if they met me in person .
you got a thing on your ....
get it ?
yeah .
hello .
hello .
chan , can i talk to you for a second ?
sure . what &apos;s up ?
just one additional relationship thought .
something you &apos;re probably aware of .
