so every time i asked you &quot; how &apos;s work ? &quot; and you said &quot; fine &quot;
you were having your own private little joke on me ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i went to blockbuster today to rent &quot; cinderella man &quot;
and guess what ?
ls it still a classic ?
i found out that our son the liar
had been fired three weeks ago .
from blockbuster ? how the fuck do you do that ?
they got rhesus monkeys working as managers over there .
he was taking promotional items and selling them--posters standups .
standees ! this whole thing &apos;s bullshit .
most of that stuff gets thrown out anyway .
the store &apos;s policy was very clear .
well maybe i care about the environment .
did that ever occur to you ? &quot; wallace and gromit &quot;
i mean that weighed like 50 lbs . how many trees gave their lives for that ?
it just goes to the dump
can i come home to a peaceful house one goddamn night ?
you tell me to think like a businessman yet
every time i do there &apos;s something wrong .
i made money promoting parties in high school that was no good .
now this . -you know what i think ?
all those days you go in late you call in sick you deserve to get canned .
the worst part is you don &apos;t even give a shit .
what i should care about blockbuster ?
fucking religious fanatics !
i can &apos;t live on what they pay me anyway . why not ? !
you live at home ! we feed you !
you have a social life but i can &apos;t ?
you have any idea what it costs at a decent club in new york ?
it &apos;s $ 500 for a bottle of cristal and it &apos;s a two @-@ bottle minimum .
you spend $ 1000 a night on champagne ?
no not every night .
all right barely ever . and hernan everybody
we take turns picking up the tab .
hernan ? or the girl he crippled when he flipped over the car ?
ls she there drinking champagne with you ... in her wheelchair ?
it wasn &apos;t his fault .
her parents are going for a big payday
because his dad was in &quot; forbes &quot; magazine .
oh god almighty !
if it makes you feel any better
i &apos;ve been looking for a new job every day online !
oh jesus ! you can &apos;t even talk to her .
are you fucking kidding me ? you should be kissing her feet .
because when you were growing up if it wasn &apos;t for her
i would have knocked all your baby teeth out with one shot .
i can &apos;t sleep .
aj .
somebody call ?
it &apos;s not only that he &apos;s a complete stranger to the truth
he &apos;s got this dead streak in him . it chills me to the bone .
he &apos;s fuckin &apos; spoiled that &apos;s all . we gave him too much .
come on he went to school with lots of privileged kids .
most of them are off in ivy league universities now doing very well .
no this is something in him .
deep down it &apos;s like this big &quot; fuck you &quot; to everything .
i don &apos;t know what that &apos;s about .
remember that whole god @-@ is @-@ dead business on the day of his confirmation ?
maybe he &apos;ll surprise us .
aren &apos;t you the sunny optimist when you want to go to sleep ?
i saw the light was on . can i come in ?
sure hon &apos; .
i &apos;m going to california . i don &apos;t know for how long .
california ?
what are you talking about ? finn took that year off . and it was great
when dad was hurt he was here for me .
but now he &apos;s going back to dental school i want to be with him .
i thought you two were having problems .
i never said that .
i don &apos;t know if i want to go to law school or med school .
those are nice options to have .
that &apos;s what we call a high @-@ class problem .
his dad said that he can get me
a lab job at ucla where he teaches oral surgery .
i mean if i decide on med school
that will look really great on my application .
what you &apos;re really saying is you &apos;re following this man to california .
meadow you drop this bomb on us at 1 : 30 in the morning

it &apos;s the right move t.
all those weeks in the hospital
surgeries constant pain for what ?
come out here and get shot over something like this ?
i &apos;m sorry .
if vito wanted to pursue that lifestyle
he should have done so quietly .
he was wasn &apos;t he ?
anyone in particular you want to give this to ?
carlo had the biggest problem with it let him handle it .
it &apos;s vito &apos;s own fault . why couldn &apos;t he stay
wherever the fuck he was ?
don &apos;t beat yourself up about this .
i &apos;ll tell carlo to be at the mall .
hi it &apos;s me .
i just wanted to let you know that we got in safe and sound .

i know .
what ?
i know .
father put it so well last week .
&quot; there &apos;s nothing gay about hell &quot; he said . that &apos;s good .

vito ... he was found beat to death this morning
in a motel in fort lee .
my cop up there told me .
minchia .
plus the homicide detectives told him
vito had a pool cue rammed up his ass .
lover &apos;s quarrel maybe ?
look we all know who did it .
phil ! the fucking balls on that prick !
what did i always say about him ?
i see you heard the news .
that must have been phil right ?
jimmy olsen over here .
i know he &apos;s out of line but still you kind of have to admire the guy .
it &apos;s not all talk with him .
i &apos;m just saying he saved us all a lot of trouble right ?
can &apos;t have been an easy decision killing a made guy huh ?
naturally phil won &apos;t brag about it &apos; cause he can &apos;t .
phil was in a tough situation his family honor was stained .
if i got to vito first net result would have been the same .
fucking @-@ a.
i wish i &apos;d have borrowed money from vito .
you know what this is right ?
it &apos;s not about vito it &apos;s about me .
phil &apos;s saying he can do whatever the fuck he wants
including kill a captain in my own family
and i can &apos;t do a fucking thing about it .
it &apos;s always been partly about that .
believe me the vitamins are just the beginning .
it &apos;s carmela .
ls paris burning ?
hi you busy ?
no no just bullshitting with sil .
how &apos;s it goin &apos; ?
actually it &apos;s cold raining .

how &apos;s the french fries ?
pommes allumettes .

more than i thought .
you realize this kid knows how to do absolutely nothing ?
she was asking if she needed to get the car serviced regularly
cause there &apos;s no snow out there .
how &apos;s prince albert ?
he &apos;d fit right in over in france .
none of those dipshits want to work either .
i did get him to hose down the trash cans though .
that &apos;s something .
you &apos;re probably busy . i &apos;ll let you go .
i just wanted to say hello . i miss you .
i miss you too . be careful eh ?
people are gonna expect a response .
see this is what the fuck i was talking about .
we hit one of phil &apos;s guys ?
joe bananas went after carlo gambino .
made guys got killed the war went seven years .
how many times do i gotta say this ?
when guys are on the mattresses they &apos;re not out earning .

i mean he &apos;s like 26 years old .
duh !
god isn &apos;t this pretty ?
&quot; 1350 a.d. &quot;
you realize some woman just like us wore this ?
she was probably married had children .
&quot; gallo roman baths
third century . &quot;
i wonder what they got up to there huh ?
this city is so old .
you think about all the people who have lived here
generation after generation
hundreds and hundreds of years all those lives .
god it &apos;s so sad .
i mean it isn &apos;t sad i don &apos;t know . it just makes you think
just makes you look at yourself differently .
there was this one night in the hospital when it was very touch @-@ and @-@ go with tony .
mm @-@ hmm . -he came out of the coma for a minute
and he said &quot; who am i ? where am i going ? &quot;
at the time i didn &apos;t know what he meant .
but coming here
i feel the same way . isn &apos;t that odd ?
let me get a picture .
oh honey what ?
we worry so much .
sometimes it feels like that &apos;s all we do
but in the end it just gets washed away .
all of it just ... just gets washed away .
come here . oh .
i know what the papers are saying
but the police think it might &apos;ve not have been a gay thing .
marie honey
they pick up strangers in bars and truck stops .
the way they beat him--oh god his face .
he didn &apos;t even look like a person anymore .
you can &apos;t let your mind dwell on ...
turn that off !
aunt cel &apos; hasn &apos;t called . not even to talk to the kids .
how could people be so cruel ?
it is a sin after all marie .
the church is very clear on that .
but you &apos;re here . you came .
father always says &quot; hate the sin
love the sinner . &quot;
i wish i was dead .
i mean it i wish i was dead !
you know what ? i &apos;ll make the funeral arrangements .
you &apos;re in no condition . given the circumstances
a small private service just the immediate family .
he was a good man wasn &apos;t he phil ?
he was . i loved him like a brother @-@ in @-@ law .
but god moves in strange ways .
our tailor he &apos;s going blind 47 years old .
walk in those shoes .
and i gotta think marie vito on some level
maybe it &apos;s better for the
kids not to have that role model .
so ...
all the women in your house are gone .
how do you feel about carmela taking a trip without you ?
do we really have to fucking talk about this ?
of course not .
before we end is there anything you &apos;d like to discuss ?
okay .
how about the fact that i hate my son ?
i come home and he &apos;s sitting on the computer
in his fucking underwear .
wasting his time in some chitchat room
going back and forth with some other fucking jerkoff
giggling like a little schoolgirl .
i want to fucking smash his fucking face in .
my son .
what do you think about that ?
anthony i think your anger towards aj
has been building for some time .
we have to deal with this .
all i know is it &apos;s a good thing my father &apos;s not alive
because he &apos;d find this fucking hilarious . find what hilarious ?
the kind of ... son i produced .
you mean because anthony doesn &apos;t conform
to your father &apos;s idea of what a man should be ?
his mine or anybody &apos;s .
let me tell you ...
if carmela let me kick aj &apos;s ass like my father kicked my ass
he might have grown up with some balls .
like you .
yeah like me .
he might have also grown up
taking out his anger
at his father &apos;s brutality towards him on others .
he might have grown up with a desperate need
to dominate and control .
anthony we &apos;ve been dancing around this for years
how you live .
what is it you want from your life ?
i couldn &apos;t even hit him if i wanted to
he &apos;s so fucking little . it &apos;s carmela &apos;s side of the family
they &apos;re small people . her father--you could
knock him over with a fucking feather .
okay .
but i have to point out
what you resent carmela doing for aj
protecting him from his father
is the very thing you had often wished
your mother had done for you .
i love this fois gras . i can &apos;t get enough .
the presentation alone gives you calories but who cares ?
we should feel guilty ? we walked our asses off .
man you know what &apos;s strange ro ?
when you go to a place you &apos;ve never been before it &apos;s like ...
all the people were imaginary till you got there .
it &apos;s like until you saw them they never existed
and you never existed to them .
i don &apos;t know maybe you &apos;re more a philosophical person than i am .
no no it just made me think that &apos;s all .
you know it &apos;s the same as when you die
life goes on without you .
like it does in paris when we &apos;re not here .
tomorrow we hit the stores .
chloe dior .
a kelly bag pour moi .
bordeaux is so delicious .
when we were in st. eustache &apos;s
