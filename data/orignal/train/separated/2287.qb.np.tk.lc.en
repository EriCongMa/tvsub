you turned hook into a dark one ?
it was the only way to save him .
after spending centuries quelling my bloodlust ,
you threw me right back into that darkness !
job well @-@ done , emma !
now it &apos;s time to get to work .
nimue . welcome to storybrooke , love .
father , father !
it &apos;s all right , son . i &apos;m here .
see ? there &apos;s nothing to be afraid of .
now ...
remember , whenever you feel scared ,
all you have to do is look inside .
we &apos;re all braver than we think if we just look deep enough .
before you know it , you &apos;re gonna be a man ,
so i &apos;m just trying to prepare you
&apos;cause then you &apos;re gonna have to answer life &apos;s big question .
what kind of man are you going to be ?
i want to be just like you .
well , that &apos;s a nice answer , son .
now , close your eyes
and find that brave part deep inside yourself , hmm ?
and you don &apos;t have to worry about a thing .
your father will watch the light for you .
just go to sleep , killian .
go to sleep .
liam ?
liam , wake up ! father &apos;s gone !
are you looking for your father ?
look out there . he rowed away an hour ago .
rowed away ? why ?
your father ain &apos;t what you think .
he &apos;s a thief , a fugitive from the law .
he heard there were soldiers waiting at the next port ,
so he bought my old rowboat ...
and left .
why would he leave us ?
how do you think he paid for the boat ?
he traded you and your brother into my service .
no ! no , he wouldn &apos;t do that !
now you know what kind of man your father really is .
it would appear i &apos;ve won .
oh , did you ?
last time we fought ,
this sword ended up at your neck .
you won a battle , not the war .
i took the dagger from you ,
and now you have nothing and never will .
watch it , pirate .
there &apos;s the rumplestiltskin we know and love !
this is why belle &apos;s left you , isn &apos;t it ?
she knows just what kind of man you really are .
and what kind is that ?
the kind who loves his power more than anything ...
more than her , more than your dead son ,
which is why it &apos;s so bloody satisfying
to take it away from you .
remember how good it felt ?
power is only as good as the one who wields it .
and you &apos;ve done nothing but parlor tricks .
oh , is that right ?
well , i think you &apos;re really gonna like what &apos;s next .
the trick where i finally get my revenge .
emma , slow down . we need to talk about this .
we need a plan .
the plan is find hook
before he resurrects all of the dark ones .
you think dealing with one is bad .
there &apos;s more than one dark one ? !
it &apos;s a long story .
well , no matter . there &apos;s seven of us .
six . dopey &apos;s still a tree .
we may be down a dwarf , but we &apos;re ready to fight .
we won &apos;t have to . i &apos;m going to take care of this .
you think you can talk him out of this ?
there &apos;s no talking .
we have to hit him with everything we &apos;ve got .
well , it &apos;s not his fault .
he didn &apos;t want to become the dark one .
but he did because of me .
none of that matters anymore .
regina &apos;s right .
we need to hit him with everything .
this is a man you loved .
that man died back in camelot .
now all there is is the dark one .
so , no matter how hard this might be ...
we need to split up , find him , and stop him ...
no matter what it takes .
come on . this is the fastest way to the harbor .
and you think we &apos;ll find hook just sipping rum by the sea ?
he &apos;s not exactly a pirate anymore .
once a pirate , always a pirate .
take it from a reformed thief , old habits die hard .
certainly do .
careful who you sneak up on .
get out of our way , zelena .
we don &apos;t have time for this .
i &apos;d like to have a little chat about my daughter .
our daughter .
about that .
i &apos;ve worked up a teeny alteration
to our custody arrangement .
i &apos;ve decided to grant myself sole custody .
see , i &apos;d like to raise her by myself
without you two getting in the way .
i &apos;m going to teach her how to be wicked .
you try and take my daughter from me ...
oh , come on .
there &apos;s no point in us fighting
over our darling baby girl
because , soon enough , you &apos;ll both be dead , and ...
then i can just take her .
what do you mean we &apos;ll be dead ?
ask them .
dark one , stand back !
come on . we can cover more ground in the truck .
behind you !
no sign of hook !
think the next stop &apos;s jolly roger .
mom , help me !
henry , don &apos;t move !
too late for that .
henry !
henry , are you okay ? !
i @-@ i think so .
what just happened to us ? !
i think i may have the answer to that .
check your wrists .
what is that ?
that ...
is the mark of charon .
charon ?
he was the ferryman in the old myths .
he navigated a boat ... to the underworld .
smart lad .
you see , the dark ones only have a ... a temporary pass
into this world , like a ... like a tourist visa .
the only way for them to stay ...
is to trade places with living souls .
meaning us ?
exactly .
and when the moon reaches its peak ,
the ferry from the underworld will arrive ...
and drag us down there .
that doesn &apos;t sound good .
speaking as one who &apos;s died and been there , it &apos;s not .
so , how do we stop it ?
we can &apos;t .
the underworld is worse than you can possibly imagine .
it &apos;s gonna make you wish
the old stories of fire and brimstone were true .
it &apos;s gonna make you wish for death .
and then the realization will hit ...
that death has already come ,
and this fresh torture is all that &apos;s left .
gold , you &apos;re scaring henry .
good , because we should all be scared .
this is death itself .
this is a fight we cannot win .
no .
i &apos;m not marked . i &apos;m not going to give up .
there has to be something we can do .
you &apos;re right . there is something .
use this time wisely .
use it to say goodbye .
thought i might find you
somewhere with a view of the sea .
oh , there &apos;s no use in hiding now .
you can &apos;t go through with this , killian .
oh , &quot; killian &quot; ?
no &quot; captain guyliner , &quot; no &quot; one @-@ handed wonder &quot; ?
where are the bon mots tonight ?
i understand you think emma betrayed you ,
but do you really think
dragging her family to the underworld &apos;s the answer ?
this from the woman who enacted the dark curse
to punish snow white for telling a secret .
you of all people should know
how far someone will go for revenge .
and , unfortunately for you ,
so do all the people you &apos;ve killed
who are waiting for you in hell .
i &apos;m not that person anymore .
oh , tell yourself what you want , love .
you may be the dark one ,
but we both know you aren &apos;t the man you were
when i recruited you to kill my mother .
when i ...
tested you ...
and when you
not ... another ... word .
no , we agreed we would never speak about this again .
don &apos;t test me again .
whoever you think i am , i &apos;m not .
you &apos;ve got no idea the kind of man i truly am .
if i &apos;d known you were gonna take as long to do your hair ...
i &apos;d have had another goblet of wine .
i think you &apos;ve had enough .
i want you sharp for what you must do next .
aye .
i will kill your mother , and in exchange ,
you will bring me to a land without magic ,
where i can finally get my revenge on rumplestiltskin .
in ... deed .
but first ...
i need to know what kind of man you are .
you don &apos;t know my mother . she &apos;s an expert at one thing :
exploiting weakness .
and i need to make sure you have none .
well , she sounds lovely .
the apple doesn &apos;t fall far from the tree .
shut up .
and get in the carriage .
ah , a test , is it ?
i &apos;ve been a pirate for over 100 years ,
and my hook has tasted the blood of dozens .
whatever your test , trust me ...
i &apos;ve got the mettle for it , love .
gold has to be missing something , right ?
there has to be a way to escape this mark .
maybe gold &apos;s right .
maybe this is a fight we can &apos;t win .
mom , you &apos;re snow white . you don &apos;t know how to give up .
hope is in your blood .
and i do hope , emma , but ...
i don &apos;t want to spend what could be my last moments
with my nose in a book .
i want to make the most of my moments with my family .
dinner at granny &apos;s .
that &apos;s what we should do .
yeah .
dinner at granny &apos;s . that &apos;s a great idea .
what about neal ? he &apos;ll be left here all alone .
he won &apos;t be alone , emma .
he &apos;ll have you .
i will not give up on my own family .
emma , we &apos;re almost out of time .
and time is what &apos;s most important --
time with those we love .
i know you won &apos;t stop trying .
and i hope you succeed , but ...
promise me that you &apos;ll ...
come meet us at granny &apos;s , come say goodbye .
i promise .
i love you , emma .
i love you , too .
so , i hear we &apos;re giving up .
no . not tonight . not ever .
if i can destroy the dark ones , no souls will be owed ,
and you will all be spared .
how ?
do you remember the promise you made in camelot ...
to do whatever was necessary to get rid of the darkness ?
i don &apos;t like where this is going .
i need you to keep that promise now .
and i need you to swear not to tell anyone else .
but to get rid of the darkness ,
you still have to put it in someone ...
and sacrifice them .
who ?
me .
you got my message .
look , i ...
i told you that i -- - o @-@ okay , here , here .
this will save you from harm
when you &apos;re crossing the town line .
a @-@ am i going somewhere ?
well , that &apos;s up to you .
you &apos;ve always wanted to see the world .
well , all of it is right out there ,
the other side of that town line .
go when you can .
see all the wonders you &apos;ve dreamt of ,
and when you &apos;ve tasted it all , maybe one day you &apos;ll come back .
go today and have a life .
is something wrong ?
no .
no , no , no , no . nothing &apos;s wrong .
i just want you to ...
live out your dream .
okay , look ...
here .
you -- you take the car ,
say goodbye to your father , and then start living .
i knew there was a hero in there .
goodbye , belle .
yeah .
we &apos;re closed .
please , go away .
no .
we &apos;re not going down without a fight .
i bet there are a lot of people in the underworld
who would be thrilled to see you and me .
we deserve it . and it doesn &apos;t matter .
there is no alternative .
there might be , but i will need excalibur .
the only possible way
excalibur would be of any use would be if --
if emma takes all the darkness into herself ...
and uses the sword to destroy it .
and herself .
excalibur was always destined ...
for the hands of a true hero .
that &apos;s it ? you don &apos;t want to make a deal or something ?
no .
you &apos;re a brave woman , emma swan .
but it might not work .
what ? why ?
well , that blade ...
it chooses who it finds worthy .
and it chooses its miracles .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
right now all that matters is
i need to be with my family while i can be .
come to granny &apos;s with me .
no , i can &apos;t .
robin and i need to protect roland
and the baby from zelena .
i &apos;ll catch up with you later .
so , just a man ?
that &apos;s the only description i get ?
oh , i &apos;m pretty sure you &apos;ll know which one i mean .
face him , and you &apos;ll prove you have what it takes
to face my mother .
i &apos;m not sure i see --
pirates ain &apos;t welcome here !
get out , pirate .
well , it seems we are at an impasse .
oh , for heaven sakes .
not him .
him .
father ?
gina ! robbie !
come on in .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
at the moment , i &apos;m trying to decide
what color would look best on your walls .
i mean , my walls .
kelly ?
hunter ? pistachio ?
oh , my god , i just realized
that all three of those work as baby names .
it &apos;s all just coming together .
cheeky .
you &apos;re not moving in , sis .
well , perhaps i &apos;m slightly premature ,
but in an hour , you &apos;ll both be dead ,
then everything that &apos;s yours ...
will be mine .
and , of course , i get the baby .
no .
you see , our child deserves her best chance .
and that &apos;s not with you .
oh , yes .
the withered knob of that sad old man .
if memory serves ,
the last time you tried to use it ,
you weren &apos;t powerful enough to make it work .
if my memory serves ...
last time , i didn &apos;t believe in myself .
but now i do , as does everyone in this town .
so , let &apos;s go somewhere , just the two of us .
oh , such a letdown .
i thought you were gonna use the thingy .
oh , i am .
so you better hang on .
i am not done !
you will see me again !
somewhere over the rainbow !
enjoy oz , witch .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s the only way i can make up for what i &apos;ve done .
you know what you need to do .
look ...
i don &apos;t want any trouble , but we &apos;re closed , mate .
why might i cause trouble ?
because i &apos;m a dirty pirate ?
or because i &apos;m a boy
whose father abandoned him on the high seas ?
killian .
aye .
but it &apos;s captain hook now .
you once told me
i had to decide what kind of man i wanted to be .
well , father ...
this is who i became !
how is this possible ?
i left nearly a century ago .
we both found a way to cheat death .
that we did .
your brother ?
liam ... was not so fortunate .
but you -- look at you .
you grew up .
where have you been ?
neverland .
i was biding my time until i found a way
to kill myself a crocodile .
it &apos;s a tale of woe and revenge
but one that you don &apos;t need to be concerned with .
it &apos;s your tale that matters .
so , tell me , father ,
where does a scoundrel like you run
after he &apos;s sold his sons into servitude ? !
oh , i &apos;m sorry , killian .
truly , i am .
i ran . i didn &apos;t get far .
not long after i left you and liam ,
i got caught and put under a sleeping curse .
a sleeping curse ?
how the bloody hell are you awake now ?
how does anyone break a curse ? true love &apos;s kiss .
who could ever find a way to love you ?
my nurse .
i could hear her speaking ...
as i slumbered .
her voice was so kind , so gentle .
she made me see the error of my ways .
i fell in love with her .
and she with me .
she changed me .
i just ...
i just ...
wish ...
that i &apos;d known her when we were together .
you could &apos;ve had the father you wanted .
the father you deserved .
i &apos;m so sorry .
where is this woman ?
a few years ... after we married ...
... she fell ill .
the plague .
she never recovered .
i came here to kill you , father .
your life was the price i had to pay
to finally get my revenge .
but we &apos;ve both lost too much .
you &apos;re going to spare me ?
in a manner of speaking .
the world must believe you &apos;re dead .
the queen , everyone must think i killed you .
i can secure you a letter of transit
to take you far from this place .
maybe you can start again .
you &apos;ll come with me ?
no , you see , i had a love , too .
and she was taken from me .
you can &apos;t destroy the plague that took yours ,
but i can destroy the plague that took mine .
i must continue on .
i hope you find peace ...
son .
we must hurry .
any delay will arouse suspicion .
i &apos;ll bring the letter of transit tonight .
actually ...
would it be possible ...
to bring two ?
two ?
my wife and i ...
we had a son .
sorry , love .
but i can &apos;t let you use that sword .
why ?
so you can get your precious revenge ?
if i do not do this , everyone i love will die .
and if you do , you &apos;ll die .
come now , hand it over . i don &apos;t want to hurt you .
now you care what happens to me ?
like it or not , i owe you .
for what ?
well , if it weren &apos;t for what you made me ,
i would never have become the man i always wanted to be .
this is not who killian wanted to be .
revenge did not matter to him .
oh , it did . ? you just briefly distracted me .
well , now i can finally make the crocodile pay .
even if it means becoming the thing you hate ?
the thing you spent centuries trying to destroy ?
if you didn &apos;t want me to change ,
you should have let me die .
i &apos;m sorry .
i couldn &apos;t watch one more person i love die .
and now , because of that ,
you get to watch everyone you love die .
no !
i will protect my family ,
even if i have to kill you to do it !
mom , wait !
henry .
killian .
do not do this .
it &apos;s too late for that , swan .
enjoy the time you have left with your family .
oh , no .
david ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s emma .
we got to stop her .
you don &apos;t have to worry .
captain hook &apos;s already seen to that .
which means there &apos;s no way
to stop your trip to the underworld .
henry ?
are you all right ?
i @-@ i @-@ i think so .
neal &apos;s back at the diner !
roland and the baby -- where are they ?
they &apos;re safe . they &apos;re with the fairies .
they &apos;ll take neal , as well .
so this is really it .
i &apos;m afraid it is , lad .
look . the s.s. purgatory .
mom , dad ! henry !
i &apos;m sorry ! i tried !
we know . it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s time to drop the act .
you can &apos;t just sit back
and watch another family be destroyed to get your revenge .
what makes you think i can &apos;t ?
because of what we swore to never speak of again .
i know the real reasony .
you don &apos;t want to talk about what you did to your father .
i believe we &apos;ve already had this conversation .
but this time you &apos;re going to listen .
because if you don &apos;t ...
you &apos;re gonna regret it for the rest of your life ,
which , in your case , means forever .
so , you have to ask yourself
the same question you did that night .
what kind of man do you want to be ?
i &apos;m scared , father .
i don &apos;t want to leave here in the morning .
i know .
but we &apos;ll be okay .
you and i will find another home .
what matters most is that we &apos;re together .
we can face anything that way .
now , it &apos;s late . close your eyes .
and remember ...
whenever you &apos;re scared , all you have to do is look ...
inside .
we &apos;re all braver than we think if we just look deep enough .
sleep tight .
i &apos;ll see you in the morning , liam .
thank you , killian .
you named your boy liam .
after my brother , after the son ...
you abandoned .
was he really that easy to replace ?
i wasn &apos;t trying to replace him .
i was trying to honor him , to honor you both .
so i &apos;d remember never to make the same mistake .
i promise , i &apos;ve changed .
no .
no , people don &apos;t change .
i saw what you said to him in there !
it &apos;s the same thing you said to me !
it was a lie then , and it &apos;s a lie now !
killian , please , it &apos;s not true .
i have changed .
i would never leave him .
but you would leave me .
killian , please , what are you doing ? !
deciding what kind of man i want to be .
you see , if the queen discovers that i &apos;ve deceived her ,
i might not get what i need , and i can &apos;t have that .
you &apos;re just not worth it .
killian ...
it &apos;s never too late . you can change .
be a different man .
it &apos;s time .
no , you &apos;re not taking the people i love !
i might not be able to kill you ,
but i can stop you from interfering .
that &apos;s enough .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
being the man i want to be .
you can &apos;t stop us .
yes , i can .
killian , you can &apos;t do this .
we both know there &apos;s no other way , love .
we have to hurry .
the darkness won &apos;t stay trapped in excalibur much longer .
take it .
no !
you have to help me , swan . take it .
i can &apos;t .
it should be me .
your family needs you .
if anyone deserves to go to the underworld , it &apos;s me .
you were right . i was weak .
so let me make up for it now by being strong .
i don &apos;t want to lose you .
and i don &apos;t want to lose you .
but you have to let me go .
let me die a hero !
that &apos;s the man i want you to remember , please !
i love you .
i love you , too .
it &apos;s okay .
oh , no .
no .
get out . we &apos;re closed .
rumple ? !
what are you doing here ?
h @-@ henry called . he told me everything .
you lied to me -- again .
belle , i --
for the first time , you were truly selfless .
you know , i don &apos;t need to see the world
to know what i want anymore .
what i want is to be with you .
马上到你的店里见我
now , you see
this isn &apos;t the library
or granny &apos;s or some bus station , miss swan .
this is my shop .
unless the sign says &quot; open ... &quot;
you &apos;re not invited .
i think i was invited .
i hear whispering .
it &apos;s the dagger .
it &apos;s calling to me .
you &apos;re upset , imagining things .
no , i &apos;m not . it &apos;s here , isn &apos;t it ?
you have it , don &apos;t you ?
yes , i do .
you are the dark one .
again .
yes .
had hoped to keep that secret .
wasn &apos;t expecting you to hear it .
but then , most ex @-@ dark ones are dead .
how is this possible ?
when you came to me , asking for the sword ,
i seen an opportunity .
a chance i had never imagined would present itself again .
as fate would have it ,
a small vial of magic was close at hand .
one sprinkle ...
and i knew i could get it all back .
i turned the sword into a conduit .
so that while hook thought he was destroying the darkness ,
he was actually ...
moving it .
channeling it someplace safe .
into you .
he had no idea .
and now ...
things are as they should be .
hook sacrificed himself , and you took that from him !
do you honestly think that you can hurt me ?
i now have the combined power
of every dark one who ever lived ...
including you .
you found a loophole , betrayed us all again .
it &apos;s what i do .
it &apos;s the man i am .
well , then , dark one ...
now that you have your power back ...
you &apos;re going to do something for me .
and why would i do anything for you ?
because i still have magic .
and i &apos;m willing to bet i can get to belle
and tell her everything before you can kill me .
don &apos;t test me .
don &apos;t test me .
you really want to take that chance ?
that she will , once again ...
know the kind of man you really are ?
what do you want , miss swan ?
you &apos;re going to hell ?
the underworld .
that &apos;s quite a distinction .
i &apos;m getting him back .
this isn &apos;t fair to killian .
gold tricked him .
everything he gave up was based on a lie .
emma , you know how this works . it &apos;s a one @-@ for @-@ one trade .
to get him back , someone else will have to die .
and you just got back from being the dark one .
you can &apos;t give in to darkness again .
i won &apos;t . i &apos;m giving in to love .
i &apos;m doing this right .
i learned my lesson . i &apos;m taking a page out of your book .
you two share a heart .
so will we .
it could work .
it will work .
uh , forgive me if i &apos;m missing the obvious ,
but , um , how does one get to the underworld ?
do it .
are you sure about this ?
do it .
hook ...
i will find you .
i will always find you .
