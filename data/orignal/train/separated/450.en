Uh, excuse me, miss.
You lost?
Uh, no.
I was actually wondering how much.
How old are you?
I'm 18.
W-wait. I have money.
Do you have a car?
I took a bus.
All right.
Hope you like doing it standing up.
I--I wouldn't know. You're my--you're my first.
I'll be gentle.
Money.
OK.
You see my hips?
See my hips? You swing right through, nice and easy.
All right, come on. You give it a try.
It was just a ride to the airport.
This wasn't exactly what I had in mind
when I said I owed you one.
Hey, you act like this is torture.
You know, there are people who think this is fun.
Believe it or not, most of my childhood sports memories
aren't altogether pleasant.
Reid, it's just one game.
We need a body. You might not even have to play.
Perfect. Can we go now?
Reid.
Just humor me?
Take the bat and get up there and give it a try.
Get up there.
You're gonna like this, kid. I promise.
See it in here. Just relax.
Here we go.
OK, OK. First try.
Keep your eye on the ball.
Gravity plus drag coefficient plus magnus--
I see what you're saying.
If I can adjust the velocity of my swing--
No, what I'm saying is get out of your head.
Just feel it.
Feel it. Feel it.
Don't think. Just feel it.
Just feel. Don't think, just feel.
Here it comes.
Reid, that's not feeling it.
I'm feeling like an idiot.
Well, today's your lucky day.
We just got a case.
Yes.
Thank God.
Last night in Miami, the body of Amanda Lopez
was found in an alley.
She had been brutally beaten and suffocated.
23 years old, originally from Tampa,
ran away from her foster home when she was 16 years old.
Runaway, prostitute. She couldn't be more high risk.
And there was evidence of sexual assault, a lot of it.
Occupational hazard.
No way to tell if our unsub is responsible for that.
Beating and suffocation.
So, he's a sadist.
A lot of violence. Were there any other victims?
Uh, actually, yes, but not the human variety.
In the last month, 6 puppies have been
suffocated and beaten, and thank God there are no photos,
because I draw the line at dead dogs.
We sure it's the same guy?
Identical DNA samples were found at all the crime scenes,
but no match in the CODIS database.
该系统包括犯罪现场收集到的不明来历DNA
Even if there was a match, it might not give us an I.D..
That sure is a lot of rage. I wonder why he's so angry.
It's about the power. Suffocation takes work.
He likes it up close and personal.
This unsub's just graduated from animals to human victims.
We need to stop him before he goes serial.
Wheels up in 30.

What are you watching?
Jeez, Mom, you ever hear of knocking?
Who was that screaming?
It just some stupid Youtube video. What do you want?
I just came to see if you wanted some breakfast.
I'm fine.
Uh, please leave me alone?
OK.
"Better than a thousand days of diligent study
is one day with a great teacher."
Japanese proverb.
Amanda Lopez has no next of kin
and no one reported her missing.
She was an easy target.
The unsub probably hoped for that.
The animals were all killed
in a relatively small geographical radius,
in a mostly middle-class suburban area.
But Amanda's body was found the other side of town
in Miami's skid row.
So he left his comfort zone to kill his first human.
A choice he probably made out of necessity.
It's hard to find easy targets
in middle-class residential areas.
He may be young. Typically you see violence to animals
in children and teens.
But the jump to humans is usually made in their mid-20s.
Mm-mmm. Thomas Dillon started killing at 39.
Joseph Duncan was 43?
Usually.
Well, either way, this guy's moving fast.
His animal kills were only days apart.
He enjoys it. And now that he's gotten a taste for humans,
he's gonna need another fix soon.
Dave, you and Blake go to the M.E..
Morgan and Reid to the crime scenes.
JJ, you're with me.
Agent Hotchner.
Detective Ogilvie, nice to meet you.
This is Agent Jareau.
Detective.
Right this way.
Thank you.
When I first saw what this guy was doing,
I wanted to call you weeks ago,
but Brass didn't think that dogs was worth the trouble.
Got you set up in here.
Here's the list of pet owners you asked for.
Thank you.
Is there anything else I can get you?
No, I think we're good for now, thanks.
Whatever you need. We're here to help.
You know, looking at the offense cluster,
there's a pretty good chance he could live,
right in this area.
Or it could just be his hunting grounds.
I don't know. I mean, look at where he killed all the animals.
You could walk between each spot,
but then he goes way up here
to get Amanda Lopez.
There's a...busline that runs straight through
both neighrhrhoods.
And she was killed only a couple of blocks
from one of the stops.
All right, so maybe he doesn't have access to a vehicle.
That would give us an abbreviated distance to crime value.
So he starts with dogs in his own neighborhood,
then when he works up the courage,
he hops on the bus
and finds his first human victim.
Garcia's compiling a list of known violent offenders in the area.
Her jaw, orbital bones
were fractured in several places.
And he did it with his bare hands.
I wouldn't be surprised if he broke one of them.
See here.
He started the beating with his right
and he finished with his left.
No defensive wounds.
He caught her by surprise in a blitz attack.
This took anger and stamina.
He's in shape or on drugs.
Or in shape and on drugs.
The actual cause of death-- suffocation.
So he beats her into submission
and then suffocates her with the bag.
We also found alcohol in her system.
She was fairly lit when he killed her.
Well, it helps that she's, what, barely 100 pounds?
Easier to subdue.
I don't think he was a very big guy himself.
You can tell by the bruising.
He's got small hands.
All that rage. And even with his animal victims.
He must be getting off on the violence.
So, he's a sexual sadist.
A young, inexperienced one.
He's disorganized, sloppy.
And he killed and dumped her in a high-traffic area.
He's too impulsive to be an older guy.
He's lucky, too.
That alley's near a major thoroughfare.
It's a miracle nobody saw anything.
Uh, excuse me, Hollie.
I think--I think I may need to go home.
I'm not feeling so good.
There's no one to cover your shift, Toby.
Can't you do it?
And work another double?
Sure. It's what I live for.
So what's wrong with you?
I...puked this morning.
I think I have the chills now.
It feels like the flu. I just--
I mean, I hope I'm not contagious.
Fine. Go.
The last dog was found in these bushes over here.
The other dogs were found in a similar park not far away.
Except for the one found
in an alley about a mile from here.
Hey, Reid.
You remember those days?
Mm, not really.
Well, where did you hang out as a teenager?
Library, chemistry lab, library--
No, no, no, no, no. I'm talking about normal,
non-genius teenage type of stuff.
Malls, coffee shops,
Parks.
We passed a mall and two coffee shops on the way here.
And a high school, too.
That would explain why the unsub's so impulsive.
He might still be an adolescent.
Mm! I thought you'd never call.
My ears are hungry.
Your voice is like food.
Well, I need your help, sweetness.
Yes, yes. Your wish is my command.
I need you to widen your search
for violent offenders in the area to juveniles.
Mm, searching for bad boys. It's my specialty.
I'll hit you with a list ASAP.
Thank you, angel.
That's all you've got is "Hey"?
You mad at me?
Mad at you? Why would I be mad at you, Toby?
You do something wrong?
Get in the car.
Get in the damn car.
What do you got to say for yourself?
I got your texts. I'm sorry. All right?
We've been over this.
You know how bad that could have been?
Yeah, I--look, I was nervous,
I freaked out. I don't-- I don't really know what happened.
It wasn't like I thought it was gonna be.
I'm sorry.
They say it's never as good as your first time.
The truth is...
first time sucks.
You don't know what you're doing.
You're fumbling around.
It's awkward.
It does get better.
I promise.
All right.
You know what?
I might have just the thing to make you feel better.
I didn't even know the bureau had a softball team.
Since when do you play?
Since Morgan drafted me.
Really? Why?
Don't let the skinny geek thing fool you.
I know the good doctor's deceptively athletic.
Oh, it's deceptive, all right.
Blake, what did you find out?
None of the pet owners had much.
Each of their dogs just disappeared from their yard.
But he did get into their yards unnoticed,
so that means he stalked them and knew their patterns.
What about the list of juvenile offenders Garcia sent us?
Local P.D.'s checking out a few names that caught my eye.
Excuse me. Agent Hotchner,
another woman's body was just found.
That was quick.
Ok. I got it.
Her name is Vicky Thomas.
22-year-old prostitute.
Originally out of Daytona beach.
And she's got a 2-year-old son.
Victimology matches.
So does the plastic bag.
Guys, this is a residential area, not frequented by prostitutes.
He didn't kill her here, he just dumped her.
He didn't beat her either. She took a blow to the head.
Bite marks. Pretty rare M.O..
He didn't do that to the other victim.
And look at her. She's filthy.
He must have rolled her around in all this trash.
Probably a forensic countermeasure
used to degrade the crime scene.
And the victim.
OK, so he beats and suffocates his first victim
and just dumps her.
But this one he clocks over the head,
bites her, but he covers his tracks.
That's a huge shift in M.O. You think he's evolving?
Well, that's a pretty rapid evolution.
It might not even be the same guy.
Well, it can't be a copycat.
The story literally just made the news.
Yeah, and what about the plastic bag?
He used that on both victims.
Yeah, but nothing about the second kill
says young or impulsive.
He thought this one through.
Guys, what if we're dealing with a team?
If there are two of them, they're feeding off each other.
This could turn into a spree real soon.
Hey there.
How you doin'?
I'm good, baby. How are you?
Oh, I had a hard day at work.
I'm just looking for a little fun.
How much?
Depends on what you want.
I want it all.
200.
Sold.
Get in.
So what's your name?
Shawna.
Shawna. That's a pretty name.
Sit back and relax and enjoy the ride.
You don't want to make me use this.
Not so tight. Not so tight.
You want to make this part last.
The trick is you want to give her a good scare.
That way she does whatever you say.
Isn't that right, Shawna?
You're gonna do whatever we tell you, aren't you?
Yeah.
Jogger ran by this morning.
Said his dog went crazy.
They're not bothering about hiding the bodies.
Not worried about being connected to their victims.
Arrogant.
What do we know about her?
Name is Shawna Radford.
21-year-old prostitute.
Some of my guys have seen her around.
She doesn't trick anywhere near here.
There's no apparent bite marks.
She's got a lot of swelling and bruising.
She obviously took a blow to the forehead.
Looks like it could have been a hammer.
So why do they even need the bag?
Suffocation's a form of torture.
And they enjoy watching her suffer.
It's also become something of a signature.
In this case, it's part M.O., part ritual.
And this combines elements of the first and second murders.
The first time was violent and sloppy.
No planning, no forensic countermeasures.
Just a lot of rage.
The second murder was more sophisticated.
If this is a team, one of them
might be much younger than the other.
Which means the older
unsub is probably the more dominant partner.
He's teaching him.
The first kill was committed by the younger unsub.
It was exactly that, his very first.
So he probably did it alone.
So what does that make the second kill?
A demonstration.
And this one's about perfecting their M.O. together.
When can I take this thing off?
This is a surprise. Why do you want to ruin it?
I--'cause I don't like surprises.
We are...here.
You know, when we started this whole thing,
I wasn't sure, I just--
You know, I didn't know if you had it in you.
Thanks a lot?
Last couple nights,
I mean, you've come a long way.
I'm proud of you, Toby.
I really am.
Go ahead. Take that thing off.
OK.
Ta-daa!
This is your surprise?
It's graduation day, my man.
Come on.
Based on victim type and kill zone dynamics,
we believe that we're looking for two white males,
one significantly older than the other.
The younger unsub we believe is an adolescent.
He probably lives in the area,
so odds are he's a student at a local high school.
We think the older unsub is in his late 30s to early 40s.
Now, he's sophisticated,
so he probably has violent criminal experience.
So you should be looking at ex-cons,
and we can't rule out people who've had law enforcement training.
The older one had access to teenagers,
but somehow he didn't stick out.
Which means he most likely lives or works near an area
where young people congregate.
Like a school, church, or a community center.
Now, he's also charismatic,
the type of guy that a teen would easily trust.
Maybe a teacher or a coach.
No. No, no, no.
It's lightweight, cheap. It won't last.
Now, this one--
Look, it's a little more expensive, but it's worth it.
Much like the D.C. Snipers,
John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo,
造成当地巨大恐慌
this is a mentor/mentee relationship,
where the old one is attempting to teach the younger one
to become a better killer.
This dynamic is rare, but the symbiotic nature
of their mutual desires actually
strengthens their affinity for one another.
There's a chance they're related.
We should consider a father and son team,
brothers, or possibly an uncle and nephew.
But even if there is no biological connection,
this relationship has all the hallmarks of their kind of bond.
The younger one's probably looking for a father figure,
trying to fill some emotional void.
No fuss, no muss.
You have your fun and Johnny law's none the wiser.
They prey on prostitutes,
so put the word on the street
to any of the working girls you may know.
Yeah, I like this one.
That's a $100 titanium framing hammer.
Beautiful...
easily traced.
Now, this one,
this is your garden variety $5.00.16-ouncer with a steel head.
Sold at a hundred stores everywhere.
This is the one you want.
And their pace is relentless.
Given their combined appetites and the player-coach dynamic,
these two are especially dangerous.
Thank you very much.
All right, let's hit it, people.
What have you got, Garcia?
Sir, I am afraid I have come up dry.
A lot of weird stuff happens in south Florida.
I found a few hammer attacks,
a shocking number of biting attacks,
but only one or the other, no combo platters.
All right, go back another 10 years.
And look nationwide.
Our older unsub must have a criminal past.
That M.O. is too specific to
just be popping up this late in his life.
You got it. Back in a flash.
All right, thanks, Garcia.
Hey. I ruled out most of the kids on that offender list,
but there is one that I'm having brought in.
His name is Jose Aguilar.
He moved to Miami right around the time
the animal murders started.
Kicked out of two schools in Orlando for bullying.
Broke one kid's nose.
Gave the other a concussion.
But that's not why I want to talk to him.
He made a visit to the E.R.,
right after being attacked by a guy with a hammer.
The kid refused to make an official police report.
Apparently he hates cops.
Keep me posted.
Jose, appreciate you coming in, man.
Like I had a choice.
Why am I here?
Look, it's all good, all right?
We just want to ask you a few questions.
I didn't do anything. I don't know anything. We done?
Kid, I get it. The neighborhood I grew up in,
we hated five-0, too.
Oh, so you can relate.
We're not those kind of cops, man.
Oh, whatever.
I think I can relate.
I doubt that.
Because when you look at me,
you jump to a particular set of conclusions.
It's human nature to make assumptions based on appearances.
It's an outdated primal instinct
born of our need to quickly assess our surroundings.
Of course, in this modern era,
those assumptions tend to be very wrong
and... often quite hurtful.
It happens to me a lot,
and I bet that happens to you all the time.
I swear I didn't do anything.
We believe you. We just
want to know what you wouldn't tell the cops
about the man that attacked you with the hammer.
I don't remember much.
You want to try something interesting?
This may sound crazy,
but close your eyes and concentrate.
I think you'd be surprised
to see how much you can remember if you try.
All right.
Do you remember what you were doing that day before the attack?
Just went to school.
What was the weather like?
Hot.
Hey. Sorry I'm a little late.
An hour's more than a little.
I said I was sorry.
You've been late almost every day for the past two weeks.
I've been really busy with school and stuff.
I'll do better.
Toby, I have to let you go.
What?
I warned you a bunch of times about being late.
I--
I'm sorry.
Then there was that thing with the puppies.
That wasn't my fault.
Look, it's my job to manage this place,
and I can't do my job if you can't do yours.
Hollie, Hollie, please.
You should go clean out your locker.
Sorry.
And what were you doing just before the attack?
Walking home from school.
I cut through the park 'cause I had to take a leak.
Then I heard this barking.
then I saw this kid
and he was beating on this dog.
It pissed me off. I like dogs.
So I jumped the kid, started beating his ass,
and the dog ran away.
The next thing I know, I get hit in the back with something hard.
It hurt like a bitch.
I look up and see some dude with a hammer.
He popped me one more time in the arm before I took off.
Did you know the kid who was beating the dog?
Some white kid. Never seen him.
He doesn't go to my school.
What about the guy with the hammer?
He was white, too, but older.
Could you describe him to a sketch artist?
The older dude--
no, it happened too fast.
But the kid...
I think so.
Good night.
See you tomorrow.
So Jose rolls up on the younger unsub while he's doing his thing.
But the older unsub just happens to be there to come to his rescue?
Or the older one was already there watching.
That attack happened months ago,
so they've known each other at least that long.
Why would a grown man in his 40s
connect with a teenager?
Easily explained if they're related.
Or if their relationship is sexual.
Well, if they were related or having sex,
there would probably be more of a connection
and there might not be such a big disparity in their M.O.s.
The dominant partner might not even allow the submissive
to participate in the kill.
If he's mentoring him, maybe it's because he wants to give back
or leave some kind of legacy.
Well, like in most cases,
the dominant one probably initiated the contact.
You think he sought the younger one out.
That's usually how it goes.
It takes talent to see talent.
When and where they met is gonna be the key.
It's only a matter of time before their partnership dissolves.
In an student/teacher dynamic there comes a day
when the student no longer needs the teacher.
Calm down, ok?
Calm down!
All right, hang on a second, I'm gonna put you on speaker.
Go ahead, baby girl. What you got?
Ask and you shall receive.
I widened my search, got a hit.
One Rudi Stein.
Had an affinity for hammering and chewing on hookers in New York.
Convicted in '89.
Had a massive stroke right there in the Sing Sing Prison yard,
died last July.
That M.O. is too similar to
what we've seen not to be related.
But the timeline doesn't fit.
Stein got locked up over 20 years ago.
What if the mentor got mentored himself?
So you think Stein mentored our older unsub?
Then the unsub learned his skills in prison.
There's a reason they call it crime u.
If the guy who took the time to mentor him suddenly died,
it could have triggered his need to pay it forward.
Garcia, I need everything you've got on Rudi Stein--
Cellmates, relatives, known associates,
and anything you can find.
Will do. Stay tuned. I'm out.
Toby. What are you doing here, man?
Like my new ride?
What are you talking about? You don't even have a driver's license.
Come check out the back.
Shut up! Remember what I told you.
Nice, huh? Just like you showed me.
She'll do whatever I say.
What the hell are you doing, man?
Dude, it's Hollie.
Your boss?
Yeah.
And you brought her here?
Yeah. We can take her out on the boat like the others.
Are you out of your mind?
You watch the news? The FBI's in town.
Bitch fired me today.
How many times have we been over this?
Never somebody you know
and never where you live.
Is this her car?
Yeah.
Oh, my god!
Go ahead, Garcia.
Sir, I've got something. From 2002 to 2006,
Rudi Stein shared a work detail
with a David Roy Turner.
He's a Miami resident.
Now, it must have been a match made in heaven,
because they remained pen pals after Turner was released.
What was Turner in for?
He assaulted an underage male prostitute.
So, he has a preference for younger boys.
It explains why he chose a teenage apprentice.
You got an address?
Uh, yeah, I already sent them.
I got a home and two work addresses.
Turner works as a groundskeeper for the Miami-Dade Parks and Rec,
and he's also a part-time bartender.
Morgan, Blake, and Reid, take the residence.
The rest of us will take the work address.
It's clear!
Clear.
Clear.
There's nobody here.
Hi, papi chulo. What's up?
Hey, good-lookin', I got
David Roy Turner's laptop in front of me.
Can you pull everything off of it?
In my sleep. Power it up. Let's go.
Get her inside.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna get the boat ready.
It'll be sweet.
Sweet? No. No, no.
Sweet is what you get when you do things right.
Work is what you get when you do things wrong.
And this is all wrong.
Why are you being such a bitch about this?
'Cause you broke every rule in the book, Toby,
and we went over the book.
Now get her inside before you really piss me off.
You at least gonna help me carry her?
You made your bed, lie in it.
Hey, Morgan, look at this stuff.
Two different closets filled with this stuff,
all unopened and unused.
No dog lives here.
I don't see a bowl or a crate or a leash, nothing.
Everything was purchased from Hal's pet shop.
I found these under his bed.
Haven't gone through every one,
but they go back to 2006.
Well, that's the year Turner was released from prison.
Could be a habit he picked up inside.
Loves sports. He's into leisure and travel.
And he is a big fan of murder.
It's not random.
There's individual sections for each case.
It gets better.
This guy was tracking the animal murders.
Yep. Every one of them.
Hey, guys.
That looks like the boy from the composite sketch.
Whoever the kid is, Turner's obsessed with him.
Hey, mama. Tell me something good.
Well, I cleaned out this Nutbag's laptop.
The guy was a torture porn connoisseur.
The dude makes Rick James seem Amish.
I also looked at his emails and social networks.
He's been in touch a lot with a Toby Whitewood,
and by a lot, I mean a couple, 3 times a day for the last year.
Well, what do you got on Whitewood?
He's a 15-year-old sophomore at McKinley High School.
His parents divorced two years ago.
He lives with his mom Claire.
That's about it. He's squeaky clean.
Garcia, what about employment or volunteer activities?
Pause. He works part-time at Hal's Pet Shop.
You got a picture of the kid?
Sent.
Garcia, that's him. You got an address?
Yep. Work address has been sent to you.
Home address is actually closer to Hotch.
Thanks.
That explains how he got close to Toby.
Somehow he figured out who was committing the animal murders,
he stalked him at his job
and eventually earned his trust.
At least help me get her on the boat?
No, I'll do it. You, uh, you clean the car.
Use the supplies in that locker.
And when I say clean, I mean spic and span.
But then we can take her out on the boat.
We are not gonna do anything.
I'm gonna take her out on the boat. I'm gonna get rid of her.
And you are gonna get rid of that car.
What?! That's not fair. She's mine.
No. No, no, no.
The second you brought her over to my house,
she became mine.
Now go.
Did you not hear me?
You know, you don't tell me what to do. You're not my father.
No. Your father bailed on you and your mom
'cause he couldn't deal.
Me, I'm the guy that got you through it.
Don't act like you did me some big favor.
I know exactly what you wanted, perv.
What's that, Tobe?
You think that I don't see the way you look at me?
I'm not stupid, you know.
I should have trusted my gut. You don't have it in you.
You're nothing but a sad little loser.
You're an old ex-con that likes hanging out with kids,
And...I'm the loser?
You're wasting my time.
Get out of here.
Come on, pretty girl.
Claire Whitewood?
Yes.
We're with the FBI. We're looking for Toby.
He's not here.
You know where he is?
I haven't seen him since this morning.
What did he do?
Yeah, go ahead, Garcia. What do you got?
Two things.
One-- David Roy Turner's father Nate,
he was a boat mechanic. He owned a repair shop.
He died 12 years ago, but according to public records,
it's still in his name.
Yes, I just sent you the address.
Yeah, I got it. Hang on, guys.
What was the second thing, Garcia?
The second thing is,
is that the manager at the pet store
where Toby works at was just reported missing by her fiance,
and her name is Hollie Riggio.
If Toby had anything to do with the girl's disappearance,
then his victim preference is changing.
Or the prostitutes were just practice
for the girl he really wanted.
You know, the old guy was right.
Taking my time to see that look in your eyes is worth it.
You see, in here,
I'm the boss.
You know about being the boss, don't you?
Get away from me!
No. No, no.
Come on.
No! No! No--
Stop it.
I taught you everything.
Oh, I can't-- my god, I can't believe this is happening.
It's like we're cursed or something.
I know this is a lot,
and we're here to help you however we can.
Is there anything I can get you?
3 years ago,
Toby and his 17-year-old sister were carjacked.
The assailant took them to a remote location
where he repeatedly raped Toby's sister
and then bludgeoned her to death.
But he let Toby live.
His mother just told us that Toby confessed
to not screaming or running
because he actually liked watching.
He said it aroused him.
It was a single-event imprint. That was his trigger.
Then we're dealing with two psychopaths.
And if they're both at the boathouse location,
then neither one of them's going to go quietly.
Here.
Oh, please.
It's ok.
Oh, please, just let me go, please.
He's gone now.
It's ok. He's just a--
he's just a hard-headed little kid.
He didn't know better.
I guess that reflects poorly on me.
Um...I don't know.
It's just, uh...
Ah, ok.
But he did tell me what a bitch you were to him.
And despite what you just saw,
I cared very deeply for that boy.
No...
So...
FBI!
Drop it!
David Roy Turner?
Put the weapon down right now.
I've been to prison.
This is Agent Hotchner.
Yes, what can I do for you?
Thank you very much.
What is it?
Dallas PD discovered an unidentified male body
with the mouth sewn shut.
Like the Silencer.
He's dead.
It's obviously a copycat.
Dallas division is into it.
They said they'd keep us in the loop.
Oh, get outta here.
Hey, pretty boy.
You made it. I like that.
You bring a glove?
Glove? I don't own shorts.
Ok, don't even worry about it, kid.
I got an extra one. Dyson's wife
had her baby last night.
So today is your day to play second base.
Wait, what?
I can't play second base.
Oh, yes, you can. You're gonna.
No such thing as can't, kid.
Go, team!
What are you guys doing here?
Oh, we were not gonna miss this for the world.
Awesome.
Great day for it.
So the Secret Service, huh?
Yeah, yeah. We haven't beat these chumps in 5 years.
They've got nothing to do but practice.
And party.
Ah, there he is. Let's go, baby.
You can do it! Come on, Spence!
Just swing it!
Strike one!
Strike two!
Strike 3!
Let's go, kid, come on.
You can do it!
You can do this!
Hey, this guy can't hit. Bring it in.
Time-out. Time-out. Time-out.
Here you go. Come on.
Listen to me, kid. Look at me.
It is the bottom of the ninth.
There's two outs. And we are losing by one run. Ok?
You are the guy, Reid.
No, I'm not.
Yes.
All you have to do is get it over their heads,
and I will score, and then you run like hell.
I've been doing the calculations. Force equals--
Reid, stop. Stop.
Get out of your head.
All the physics in the world will not work unless you just let it flow.
I don't know if I can.
You remember all those unpleasant childhood sports memories?
Ok, right now, you can erase them, all of it for good.
Kid, stop thinking.
Just feel it.
Ok.
You got this. You got it?
You got this. Let's go.
Come on, pretty boy!
He's the man.
Strike one!
Attaboy. Attaboy. Whoo!
You gotta believe it.
You can drive 'em in. Come on, you can drive 'em in, baby.
Strike two!
This guy's got nothin'.
Run!
Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Yes! Yes!
Get down! Come on! Get down, get down!
Safe! Yes! Yes!
You did it! You did it! Whoo!
