the only thing stronger than your craving
for blood is your love for this one girl .
your humanity is killing you .
turn it off !
what did you do ?
i fixed him .
fight for it . feel something . anything , stefan .
&apos;cause if you don &apos;t , you &apos;re going to lose me forever .
i &apos;ve heard about you . the crazy , impulsive vampire
in love with his brother &apos;s girl .
as long as klaus is alive , i do what he says .
what the hell did you do ?
he &apos;s earned his freedom .
i had klaus . this could have all been over .
we &apos;ll survive this .
we &apos;re never getting stefan back .
then we &apos;ll let him go .
what now ?
now , i reunite my family .
you mean , the people you cart around in caskets .
what &apos;s the matter , klaus ? missing something ?
i will kill you and everyone you &apos;ve ever met .
do that , and you will never see your family again .
excuse me .
i should have been watching where i was going .
don &apos;t worry about it .
you have a nice day .
i think i &apos;m going crazy .
i &apos;m totally paranoid all the time .
you have a right to be .
klaus is sill out there , and he knows you tried to kill him .
why hasn &apos;t he made a move ?
there &apos;s been no sign of him , nothing .
just my slow spiral into insanity .
join the club .
every time i close my eyes ,
i have that nightmare on repeat .
the same dream ?
yeah .
4 coffins .
klaus is in one of them . it &apos;s weird .
what if it &apos;s not just ... some dream ?
what if it &apos;s , like , you know , a witch dream ?
it &apos;s just stress . i &apos;ll figure it out .
what about stefan ? has there been any sign of him ?
he betrayed us , bonnie .
the stefan that we know is gone .
how is damon handling that ?
damon is ...
damon .
uh , you have your choice--
bloody mary , screwdriver .
brunch in a bottle .
come on , ric . i can &apos;t drink all this by myself .
i mean , i can , but then
somebody &apos;s getting naked .
oh , man .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re making me drink alone .
i &apos;m busy .
it &apos;s the eve of klausageddon .
you &apos;re doing homework ?
this may come as a shock ,
but i am not here to hang out with you .
i &apos;m here to see jeremy , who is an hour late for his shift .
kids today . where are their values ?
不及格
that &apos;s his midterm paper .
copied it straight off the internet .
didn &apos;t even try to hide it .
somebody &apos;s getting grounded .
did you say you were waiting for jeremy--
as in jeremy gilbert ?
yeah .
he was fired last week .
nice shot .
so what &apos;s the point of this , again ?
the point is i &apos;m pissed at caroline ,
and bonnie dumped your ass .
the point ...
is to get drunk and shoot stuff .
profound .
alaric finds out i took this ,
he &apos;s going to use it on me .
so , what &apos;s the deal with that ?
he &apos;s , like , your guardian now ?
sort of , yeah . i think he feels responsible for us .
you like him ?
yeah . yeah . i like him .
hey , you want to move out of the way ?
i &apos;m a hybrid , gilbert .
you can &apos;t kill me
unless you cut off my head or rip out my heart .
and you &apos;re not going to do it with that lame @-@ ass crossbow .
go ahead .
take a shot .
unless you don &apos;t think you can hit me .
jeremy , the minute that you get this , call me .
unbelievable .
you &apos;re feisty when you &apos;re mad .
it &apos;s not that i &apos;m mad . i &apos;m just--i &apos;m worried .
why ? he lost his job at the grill ?
i think he &apos;ll survive , elena .
he &apos;s spiraling .
ever since bonnie broke up with him ,
he &apos;s moody .
he &apos;s not really talking to anyone .
just a typical teenager .
who &apos;s seeing ghosts
and who &apos;s lost everyone that he cares about .
not everyone . he still has you .
you ok ?
what makes you think i &apos;m not ok ?
well , you &apos;re a day drunk .
it &apos;s not exactly your most attractive look .
oh . what is my most attractive look ?
i &apos;m not saying you have any attractive look . i &apos;m just ...
saying this is my least favorite one .
noted . see if i can make any improvements .
don &apos;t mind me .
you going to do this in the grill ,
in front of everyone ?
it &apos;s a little beneath you , don &apos;t you think ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i just came down to my local pub
to grab a drink with a mate .
get around , then , would you , tony ?
i &apos;m surprised you stuck around town
long enough for happy hour .
my sister seems to be missing . need to sort that out .
cute , blonde bombshell ? psycho ?
shouldn &apos;t be too hard to find .
truth is ,
i &apos;ve grown to rather like your little town .
thinking i might fancy a home here .
i imagine you &apos;re wondering how does this affect you .
and the answer is , not in the slightest .
as long as i get what i want ,
and everyone behaves themselves ,
you can go on living your little lives however you choose .
you have my word .
what more could you possibly want ?
well , for starters ,
you can tell me where i might find stefan .
stefan skipped town the second he saved your ass .
well , you see , that is a shame .
your brother stole from me .
i need him found so i can take back what &apos;s mine .
that sounds like a klaus and stefan problem .
well , this is me broadening the scope , sweetheart .
hello , bonnie .
stefan .
you followed me here ?
yeah .
it wasn &apos;t too hard . you should probably be more careful .
what do you want with me ?
relax . i just need your help .
why would i help you ?
elena said you saved klaus &apos; life .
let me fill you in on a little secret about klaus .
he kept his family with him at all times ,
daggered , stored in coffins .
and now , i have them .
and i need you to help keep them hidden .
you &apos;re out of your mind . you &apos;re just going to make him angrier .
his family is his one weakness .
as long as i have that , i can ruin him .
i don &apos;t have enough power to hide 4 originals .
you &apos;re a witch . you hate klaus .
i know you can figure something out .
you ready ?
vampires , hybrids , and originals .
no problem .
my rebellious brother ... i &apos;m worried .
proof you &apos;re still human .
just in time . we &apos;re cooking .
sorry . just passing through .
i thought we &apos;d all stay in ,
have a meal together like a typical atypical family .
why ?
maybe because you got fired
and you didn &apos;t tell anyone .
look , can we do this later ?
i made plans with tyler . he &apos;s right outside .
wait .
when did you start hanging out with tyler rockwell ?
i don &apos;t know . does it matter ?
yeah , jeremy , it matters .
he was sired by klaus . he &apos;s dangerous .
he can still hear you . he &apos;s right outside .
besides , you of all people are going to lecture me
on who i can and can &apos;t hang out with ?
what is with the attitude ?
whatever . this is lame . tyler &apos;s waiting .
no . oh , no , no . you &apos;re not going anywhere ,
especially not with tyler .
i &apos;m with her on this , jer . sorry .
all right . fine . you want me to stay in ?
let &apos;s all stay in , then .
yo , tyler , come on in .
jeremy--
i think it &apos;s about time we had a drink , don &apos;t you ?
i &apos;d say we &apos;re overdue .
well , you &apos;ve been so busy ,
what with all your plotting and scheming .
you know me-- never miss a chance to plan an epic failure .
don &apos;t be so hard on yourself .
who could have guessed your own brother would betray you ?
well , i did have a front row seat when your sister lied to you .
yeah , well , she &apos;s fickle that one .
and you say you have no idea of her whereabouts ?
that &apos;s the thing with younger siblings .
you just-- never know what they &apos;re going to do .
drink ?
thanks .
this is weird .
klaus has hybrids stalking me ,
and now , you &apos;re just sitting in our kitchen .
look , maybe i should go .
no , stay . you &apos;re not doing anything .
unless you have to , you know , check in with your hybrid master .
it &apos;s not like that , elena .
tell me , tyler--
what is the difference
between being sired and being compelled ?
compulsion ... that &apos;s just mind control ,
like hypnosis .
and being sired is ...
it &apos;s like faith .
you do something because you believe it &apos;s the right thing .
so , you believe that serving klaus is the right thing .
i don &apos;t serve him .
klaus released me from a curse that was ruining my life .
i owe him for that .
what if he asked you to ...
jump off a bridge ?
he wouldn &apos;t . and even if he did ,
i &apos;d be fine . i &apos;m a hybrid .
ok . so what if he asked you to rip your own heart out ?
again , he wouldn &apos;t .
what if he did ?
i don &apos;t know . then i &apos;d rip out my heart .
you guys sound like caroline ,
getting all freaked out over something you don &apos;t understand .
you &apos;re right , tyler . i don &apos;t understand .
klaus has terrorized every single one of us ,
and you &apos;re just blindly loyal to him .
you &apos;re overthinking it .
i can still make my own decisions .
cheers , mate .
down the hatch .
you know , we &apos;ve actually got a lot in common , you and i.
really ?
well , yeah . maybe we can ...
bond over our mutual loathing of my brother .
why are you so mad at him ?
he stole something ?
my family . the originals .
i had them daggered , boxed up ,
awaiting the day when i saw fit to wake them .
and he went in and pinched the bloody lot .
of course he did .
ah , such a buzz kill , my baby bro .
well , i &apos;d love to find him .
just the trouble is
i sure as hell don &apos;t work for you .
you know , your drink stinks of vervain ,
so i can &apos;t compel you .
there &apos;d be no point in killing you ,
because you &apos;re actually the one with the most hope
of getting me what i need . and yet ,
it would seem a demonstration is in order .
perhaps i wasn &apos;t clear enough
when i told you to find stefan .
oh , well .
it seems you people respond best to displays of violence .
why don &apos;t you take this as an example of my reach ?
there he is .
so , that thing i told you to do .
why don &apos;t you go ahead and get on with it ?
what was that about ?
it was nothing .
i got to go .
thanks for the food offer , but ...
next time .
well , that was illuminating .
so , tyler lockwood is
a lunatic who has access to our house .
i mean , this whole sire bond thing is wild .
i don &apos;t even think tyler &apos;s fully aware of
what little reason lies behind what he &apos;s saying .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s his weird cult logic .
well , great . that &apos;s a wonderful influence for you , jer .
jeremy ?
that &apos;s his ring .
where &apos;d he go ?
jeremy ?
what is he doing ?
oh , my god .
jeremy !
jeremy ! jeremy , move !
there i go again , bumping into people .
he &apos;s going to be all right . are you ok ?
i don &apos;t understand .
who was that on the phone earlier ?
it was klaus .
you were compelled , jeremy .
we &apos;ve got to get him inside . help me .
compel the men to open up this wall .
we need sun .
i want a fortress , not a dungeon .
there he is . man of the hour .
so everything went ok ?
tony ran down alaric instead of jeremy ,
but apples , oranges .
message learns the same .
you said you were sending them a warning .
and i did-- an effective one .
elena &apos;s family suffers ,
she &apos;s motivated to get me what i want .
i didn &apos;t think that we &apos;d actually have to kill anyone .
tyler , mate .
what you &apos;re feeling is the remnant of a guilty conscience .
i need you to get over it , ok ?
end of the day ,
human life here is just a means to an end--
our means to our end .
you &apos;d do well to remember that .
how is he ?
he &apos;s dead , but he had his ring .
klaus &apos; hybrid hit him . now we just wait .
jeremy , why aren &apos;t you wearing vervain ?
where &apos;s your bracelet ?
i don &apos;t know .
it was tyler .
it had to have been .
that &apos;s why he was hanging out with you ,
to get you off the vervain .
klaus is trying to send us a message .
he wants us to find stefan ,
who stole his coffins of all his dead family members .
coffins ?
yep .
so all we have to do is find 4 coffins ,
and voila ,
no one else on your family &apos;s christmas list has to die .
wait , that &apos;s your big plan ,
to steal back 4 dead originals ,
so this evil hybrid doesn &apos;t kill me
and everyone else we know ?
you got a better idea ?
yeah .
let &apos;s get the hell out of here .
pack our bags and go .
hey , jeremy , calm down .
no , no , i &apos;m not going to calm down , elena .
this happens every time no matter what we do ...
you get on my case about school and work . who cares .
none of us are going to make it out of this town alive .
he said he wants his family back .
no . no , i know what you &apos;re thinking .
the answer &apos;s no .
if we give him rebekah ...
yeah , then klaus un @-@ daggers her .
first thing she does is kill you .
frying pan , fire .
not an option .
klaus &apos; coffins .
how many did you say there were ?
elena ?
klaus is looking for 4 coffins , just like in your dream .
i think it &apos;s not just stress .
elena , don &apos;t get involved .
whatever klaus wants , stay as far away from it as you can .
klaus won &apos;t let me . bonnie ...
he tried to kill jeremy .
what do you want me to do ?
we need to find stefan .
look , i know that you don &apos;t think
that your locator spell still works ,
but we have to at least try .
you don &apos;t need a locator spell .
bonnie said this place lost all its mojo .
the dead witches were angry
at her for bringing jeremy back to life .
i guess now they have something they want her to know .
that &apos;s why i hate witches . so fickle .
passive @-@ aggressive .
stefan ?
come on , stef . olly olly oxen free .
really ? still ?
what ?
the witchy spirits aren &apos;t a big fan ,
and they used their juju to screw with my daylight ring .
then wait outside .
elena ...
i &apos;m not leaving until i know if he &apos;s here .
stefan ?
go away .
you shouldn &apos;t be here , elena .
stefan , i need your help .
bonnie said that you would be here .
well , bonnie sucks at keeping secrets .
listen , you need to give klaus his family back .
oh , really ? is that what i need to do ?
klaus compelled jeremy
to stand in front of a speeding car .
don &apos;t you get it ?
stefan , he &apos;s not going to stop
until he gets what he wants ...
elena , stop talking .
i &apos;m not giving klaus anything .
are you listening to me ?
he &apos;s going to kill jeremy .
not really my problem .
you can go to hell .
that didn &apos;t go over well .
don &apos;t even start , damon .
let me talk to him .
you can &apos;t get in .
the witches won &apos;t let you .
here .
take my car keys .
you go deal with your brother .
i &apos;ll deal with mine .
that was impressive .
but the coffins aren &apos;t here ,
so you can go away now .
i don &apos;t care about the coffins .
we need to talk .
ok .
let &apos;s talk .
nothing &apos;s ever easy with you , is it ?
that is for screwing up my plan .
you stopped me from killing klaus ,
and you steal his family . why ?
it doesn &apos;t make sense .
answer me !
piece by piece ,
klaus took everything from me .
i &apos;m doing the same to him .
but i had him , stefan !
why &apos;d you screw it up ?
i did it to save you .
what ?
no . no way .
you didn &apos;t do this for me .
he was one step ahead of us .
if klaus died ,
his hybrids would have killed you .
when are you going to get it through your head ?
stop saving me .
don &apos;t do it , jeremy .
why not ? you stab my back , i stab yours .
i didn &apos;t stab you in the back .
is that why you wanted to hang out ,
to get me off the vervain ?
klaus asked me to .
i never thought he would try to kill you .
it &apos;s klaus , tyler .
what did you think was going to happen ?
he doesn &apos;t care about you .
all he wants is to get his family back .
what the hell !
whenever klaus wants something , someone ends up dead .
you think about that next time
before you blindly do whatever he says .
jer , you should get home . stay inside .
klaus isn &apos;t going to stop
until he gets all those coffins back .
he &apos;s not done with you .
ric . hey . when did you return to the living ?
oh , just a few minutes ago . how &apos;s jeremy ?
hating me .
hating life . hating the life that
we can &apos;t even have a family dinner
without somebody dying before dessert . are you ok ?
oh , my god .
something &apos;s wrong . the ring .
ric .
what happened ?
he got hit by a car , and he &apos;s coughing up blood .
get his vitals .
pulse thready and weak .
looks like internal bleeding . we got to get him out of here .
let &apos;s move .
let &apos;s not and say we did .
why don &apos;t you two meet us at the hospital ?
what ?
no . no , no , no . wait .
no , wait . you have to help him .
what are you doing ?
you can still save his life , elena .
here . take my blood .
i can &apos;t get in .
you &apos;re going to have to invite me .
no . why are you doing this ?
klaus asked for his family .
you didn &apos;t deliver .
ric !
oh , my god , ric . i &apos;m right here .
hey , look . he &apos;s gonna die .
my word i would invite me in , elena .
jeremy .
he &apos;s not dead yet .
where are you going ?
what are you doing ?
now he &apos;s dead .
we &apos;ve got to get alaric to the hospital , now .
you know what i can &apos;t figure out ?
why save me ?
was it brotherly love , guilty conscience ,
is the switch on , is the switch off ?
do you have somewhere you need to be , damon ?
ah , deflection .
that &apos;s not going to work on me . i invented that .
we &apos;re done . can &apos;t you just go away ?
not until you tell me why you saved me .
you owe me that .
i don &apos;t owe you anything .
fine .
next question ,
why did you steal the coffins ?
because klaus &apos; family is one weakness
i can use against him .
use against him to do what ?
you &apos;re not going to kill him . you know how i know this ?
because there was only one way to kill him ,
and you blew that to save me .
you &apos;re wrong , damon .
klaus doesn &apos;t get to just live forever .
there &apos;s another way . there has to be .
fair enough .
whatever you &apos;re doing , i want in .
i don &apos;t need your help .
really ? last time i checked ,
you were hiding out in a haunted house .
i &apos;m in this alone , damon .
you go after klaus ,
you &apos;re going to have to be cutthroat and devious .
i &apos;m so much better at that than you .
come on , brother .
what do you say ?
if you &apos;re going to keep saving my life ,
at least make it for a good reason .
you want in , huh ?
ok . but it &apos;s just me and you .
elena stays out of it .
deal .
follow me .
wait . i &apos;m not so ... welcome in there .
don &apos;t you worry , damon . we all want the same thing .
have a look .
what ?
klaus is allergic to dust ?
look again .
witch spirits hate klaus as much as we do .
they &apos;re using their powers to hide the coffins .
so if he comes in the house .
he won &apos;t be able to find them .
mr. saltzman . what are you doing up ?
you should be resting .
uh , i &apos;m more of a walk @-@ it @-@ off kind of guy .
do i need to sign something ?
internal hemorrhaging , 3 broken ribs ,
and a severe concussion .
i have no idea how you &apos;re on your feet right now ,
but i need to run some more tests .
actually , i have someplace i need to be .
but thank you , dr ...
fell .
but the patience who follow my advice get to call me meredith .
well , i appreciate your help , dr. fell
mr. saltzman ...
what is your secret ?
guardian angel , or did you sell your soul to the devil ?
little of both .
thank you for coming .
i trust you have news of stefan .
i couldn &apos;t find him .
but i have something else .
my poor sister .
i can &apos;t turn my back on her for a moment .
you have rebekah .
a deal is a deal .
the life of my sister in exchange for your brother ?
yeah , i &apos;d say that &apos;s a bargain .
consider him spared .
you should know ,
i was the one that daggered her .
when she wakes , she &apos;ll come after me .
i can control rebekah .
besides , i still need your help finding stefan .
i told you , i don &apos;t know where he is .
you &apos;re lying .
fortunately , you have no shortage of loved ones .
if i don &apos;t find my family ,
the question you should be asking yourself is ,
who &apos;s going to die next ? bonnie ? caroline ?
damon ?
it &apos;s only a matter of time before stefan gives me what i want .
he doesn &apos;t care about me any more .
you made sure of that .
you turned him into a monster .
now he &apos;s your problem .
and just so you know ,
i &apos;m not the only one rebekah wants dead .
she knows what you did to your mother .
she knows that you killed her .
you can let yourself out .
so the ring brought you back to life ,
but it didn &apos;t heal you . does that mean it &apos;s broken ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s never happened like that before .
i guess i have damon &apos;s blood to thank
for the fact that i &apos;m still walking .
he said to say you owe him a drink .
that &apos;s funny .
i &apos;d rather have head trauma .
hey , jeremy ...
you ok ?
why wouldn &apos;t i be ?
i shot a hybrid in the back
and chopped his head off with a meat cleaver .
typical sunday , huh ?
you can talk to me about this stuff . you know that , right ?
what could you tell me that i don &apos;t already know ?
this is the way things are .
it sucks , but i just got to get used to it .
did you get rid of him ?
yeah . tony the headless hybrid &apos;s
now at the bottom of steven &apos;s quarry .
what about alaric ?
took care of him , too .
he &apos;ll be fine .
how are you ?
i think i got most of the blood off the porch .
elena .
look at me .
it &apos;s going to be ok .
i have to tell you something .
i made a deal with klaus .
i gave him rebekah .
what ?
no , no . no . you did not do that .
she &apos;s going to come here and try and kill you .
no , she won &apos;t .
klaus won &apos;t let her because he needs me .
and suddenly , you trust him ?
no , i don &apos;t trust him .
but what other choice do i have ?
i don &apos;t trust stefan .
do you think he &apos;s just going to give up the coffins ?
my brother &apos;s ...
sort of running his own show right now .
yeah . my brother just chopped off someone &apos;s head .
it &apos;s not right .
it &apos;s not fair . he &apos;s 16 years old .
he shouldn &apos;t have to live like this .
elena ...
there has to be another way .
i have to fix it .
we will .
we will .
we will .
ok ?
here we are , rebekah .
home , sweet home .
only took 1,000 years .
and to think ,
i was counting on you being here with me .
but that &apos;s all ruined now , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
sister .
we &apos;ll meet again one day .
can we talk ?
what did i do now ?
i &apos;ve been thinking about what you said earlier ,
about how we should pack up and go .
elena , i didn &apos;t mean anything of that .
but you were right .
you shouldn &apos;t has to give up your normal life ,
just because of me .
what &apos;s going on ?
your sister thinks we should have another one of our talks .
here &apos;s the thing , jeremy .
you &apos;re going to go out of town for a little while .
a long while .
you &apos;re going to stay with some nice family friends in denver .
you &apos;re going to be in a new school and meet new girls--
living girls .
you &apos;re going to drink a few beers , take an art class .
you can do whatever you want .
tell him he &apos;s going to leave mystic falls behind
and never think twice about it .
you &apos;re going to leave mystic falls behind
and never think twice about it .
you &apos;re going to have a better life , jeremy .
this is the one i dreamed of .
don &apos;t bother . it won &apos;t open .
what do you mean , is it locked ?
nope . it just won &apos;t open . i &apos;ve tried everything--
blow torch , ax , crowbar .
i can &apos;t even scratch the finish .
that means it &apos;s closed with a spell .
you mean whatever &apos;s in there
should probably stay in there .
you said you wanted to make him suffer .
the witches led me here for a reason .
i think whatever &apos;s inside this coffin is our answer .
i feel like a horrible person .
you just saved his life , elena .
take it from me-- estranged is bad
dead is worse .
just can &apos;t stop thinking about what happened
the last time i asked you to compel him .
he found out , and he got over it .
again , not dead , elena .
he &apos;s so lucky to have you for a sister .
thank you .
no problem .
not just for this , damon . for everything .
i don &apos;t know what i would do if you weren &apos;t here .
you should know this , elena .
stefan didn &apos;t screw us over .
he screwed us over , but he had a good reason .
what ?
he saved klaus to save me .
then he stole the coffins to get even .
damon , if he did it to protect you , then--
why would he even do that ? i mean--
oh , what does it even mean ?
what does it mean ?
it means i &apos;m an idiot .
&apos;cause i thought for one second
that i wouldn &apos;t have to feel guilty anymore .
what are you talking about , guilty for what ?
for wanting what i want .
damon ...
no , i know . believe me , i get it .
my brother &apos;s girl and all .
no . no . you know what ?
if i &apos;m going to feel guilty about something ,
i &apos;m going to feel guilty about this .
