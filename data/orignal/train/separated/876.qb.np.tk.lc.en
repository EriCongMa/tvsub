back in the &apos; 80s , mtv did this crazy thing ...
and actually played music videos .
they taught us that huge hair and a sick guitar solo ...
could turn a mere mortal into a rock god .
so , like all kids , i formed an epic garage band
with my brother , barry .
and we were the stuff of legends .
well , in our minds .
thank you , philadelphia .
good night !
okay , so we weren &apos;t twisted sister ,
but we thought we were .
we &apos;re , like , guaranteed to be superstars .
i mean , i &apos;m big tasty , the rapper who can rock a mike .
but i can also rock a guitar .
you know , if we &apos;re gonna be selling out mega @-@ stadiums ,
maybe we should learn more than one song .
it &apos;s not about the music , okay ?
it &apos;s about the showmanship
and pageantry and smoke machines
and glitter cannons and giant hair
and codpieces .
seems a bit much .
well , the front man gets all the ladies .
so i make all the decisions for barry and the hendersons .
i told you , our band name isn &apos;t gonna have &quot; barry &quot; in it .
let &apos;s just put it on the board ,
see what it looks like -- maybe we &apos;ll fall in love .
sure , we had our creative differences .
but the one thing we could agree on
was that we were the greatest band that ever existed .
just ask our groupies .
thank you , veterans stadium !
good night !
sounds like nobody &apos;s gonna take it .
mission accomplished !
yes !
oh , you &apos;re so awesome !
you remind me of my other favorite band ... kiss .
no , no , no , no ! stop , stop !
it was mid @-@ summer , 1980 @-@ something ,
and america had its latest obsession --
the royal wedding .
and no one was more into prince chuck and lady di than my mom .
that prince charles .
imagine what it &apos;s like to be married
to someone so regal and majestic .
hey , bevy , what kind of mustard do i like ?
you like ketchup .
we have company . put on pants or leave .
yeah . you win this round .
guess we can &apos;t all have prince charles , huh ?
oh , hush .
he may not be the biggest fan of slacks ,
but murray can be very romantic .
trust me .
charles and diana got nothing on our wedding .
i want to see pictures , wedding pictures , right now .
oh , no , no , no , no , no .
they &apos;re all packed away in the attic .
here &apos;s the album .
thank you , janice .
thank you for chiming in .
now , tell me why murray is sitting down during your vows .
he got woozy .
big day , low blood sugar .
he ate a plum . it was fine .
listen , we all have things about our wedding
that we &apos;d like to redo , right ?
that &apos;s why the hubby and i decided
to renew our vows last year .
you what , now ?
just an intimate ceremony .
you know , some friends and family
and a band , some cake .
you can have a second wedding ?
no !
come on .
it &apos;ll just be a little ceremony .
marriage is not like a magazine subscription .
you don &apos;t have to keep renewing it .
well , you do if you want to keep the magazine .
well ... this magazine right here ,
you get for free for the rest of your life .
how do you like that ?
you don &apos;t want to do this ? fine .
how &apos;d you make tears so fast ?
they &apos;re always there ,
lying in wait , because i feel so deeply .
fine ! you wore me down .
he said yes !
he said yes !
while my mother couldn &apos;t wait to renew her vows ,
my sister was doing some waiting of her own .
just stop talking and play the bangles already .
i know ! it &apos;s music television !
they should just play videos and nothing else .
back then , you couldn &apos;t just pull up your favorite song
with a click on youtube .
you actually had to sit ...
play the video !
... and wait and wait until that one glorious moment
when your favorite video finally came on .
and nothing would stop you from singing along .
close your eyes
give me your hand , darl--
no !
i will kill you ! i am not kidding .
i will go to jail . i will do my time .
i may come out a different person ,
but it &apos;ll be worth it !
forget the lame @-@ ass chick music .
i &apos;m cordially inviting you out to the garage
to hear a real band .
this ...
this is for you , girl .
i ... pick ... you .
yep , barry had become obsessed
with erica &apos;s best friend , lainey ,
ever since she kissed him
in a moment of incredibly poor judgment .
i &apos;ll dedicate a jam to you , girl .
just come to one of our gigs .
in the garage ? no .
are we done with this horrible interaction ?
because there &apos;s a tv upstairs . let &apos;s go !
too bad lainey didn &apos;t feel the same way .
ah , she &apos;s good .
acting all , &quot; i don &apos;t like you . &quot;
i think that &apos;s &apos; cause she doesn &apos;t like you .
aw , sweet , naive baby child .
she &apos;s just playing hard to get .
it &apos;s obvious i &apos;m all she thinks about .
it &apos;s not that obvious .
it &apos;s all a part of the game of love , my brother .
and once we &apos;re topping the charts ,
she &apos;ll change her tune .
man ! i can &apos;t wait to be famous .
all the kids at school who call me a nerd
are gonna beg to be my best friend .
and i &apos;ll buy a ferrari for every day of the week .
and i will have every garbage pail kid ever made .
and chuck norris will be my personal trainer
till his wife falls in love with me and it gets awkward .
and i &apos;ll buy bubbles the chimp from michael jackson
and give him a new name with dignity ,
like william or professor bananas .
and charles barkley will beg me to join the sixers .
and we &apos;ll live in a mansion in miami ,
and gloria estefan and the miami sound machine
will be our neighbors .
and we &apos;re gonna paint the name of the band on the roof
so everyone can see it from the sky !
we &apos;ll be rock gods .
there &apos;s only one way to get there .
we got to get ourselves a gig .
so we did what any band does when they need a big break .
we asked our mommy .
yeah .
that &apos;s gonna be a polite pass .
what ? !
you never say no to us !
ah ! we &apos;re your delicious snuggle monsters .
i don &apos;t think she understands .
give us the thing we want !
love to .
but can &apos;t .
joke ! she &apos;s kidding .
you &apos;re hired .
yes ! i knew we were amazing .
we charge 200 bucks , non @-@ negotiable .
dad , i thought we agreed on dueling harpists .
we &apos;ll have them play one song at the very end .
the noise will sober everybody up for the drive home .
it &apos;s money well spent .
i told you you didn &apos;t have to pay for all this .
stop .
what does my princess want ?
well , i do have a few ideas .
i &apos;m thinking ice sculptures and a horse @-@ drawn carriage
and , um , oh , those carving stations
where they have the different meats
and then you point at the meats , and they give you the meats .
you want meats , you got meats .
&quot; wedding binder &quot; ?
isn &apos;t this what you have when the wedding is real ?
just shut up and let me do this .
all you have to do is write your vows .
go .
how about , instead ,
i go up and clean out the gutters
like you &apos;ve been nagging me to do ?
there &apos;s your romance .
write your vows .
for my dad , that was his definition of no fun .
this is gonna be so much fun !
okay . barry told us about the $ 200 .
let &apos;s do this .
whoa , whoa . what &apos;s happening ?
good news . the girls are joining the band .
barry ignored the cardinal rule of being in a band .
lainey .
he let a girl come between us .
you could share my mike . it &apos;s great for duets .
your breath smells like cat food .
i can assure you , it &apos;s people food .
what -- we &apos;re a two @-@ man band .
i &apos;m not splitting our appearance fee with them .
think about it .
what &apos;s better than performing for her ?
performing with her .
now we &apos;ll make sweet music together ,
and she won &apos;t be able to deny her feelings for me .
but it &apos;s supposed to be you and me !
it is just you and me ... and them .
you know what would be so cool ?
if we did an all @-@ acoustic set .
totally !
that is a great idea , lainey !
adam , take five .
let &apos;s brainstorm .
do you have any band names , lainey ?
ooh . how about the gal pals ?
nailed it !
never !
as my band was writing me off ,
my dad was busy writing his vows .
okay , so , he wasn &apos;t writing .
he was watching his favorite tv show , &quot; family ties . &quot;
like all shows at the time ,
it was only as good as its opening theme song .
murray !
are you watching tv ?
no , no , no , no , no .
i &apos;m just sitting in my writing chair ,
letting the ideas flow from my pen .
you &apos;re gonna love what i got .
it &apos;s blank .
yeah , i got it all up here , baby .
i know exactly what i want to say .
let &apos;s hear it . right now .
right now ?
you want to pre @-@ hear
the special vows i wrote special ?
who does that ?
me . go .
my dad knew he just had to speak from the heart
or the next best thing -- quote an epic theme song .
i bet we &apos;ve been together for a million years .
and i bet we &apos;ll be together for a million more .
it &apos;s like i started breathing on the night we kissed .
my dad couldn &apos;t remember our birthdays ,
but he remembered every damn word of that theme song .
what would we do , baby ...
without us ?
sha @-@ la @-@ la @-@ la .
that ... was ...
amazing !
you love me so much !
i really do .
i really do .
sha @-@ la @-@ la @-@ la .
oh , i cannot wait for you to say that
in front of our friends !
well , you know i was just spitballing .
i &apos;m gonna have to rewrite it .
no ! no , no , no , no , no .
you say those words exactly .
i said no more than 10 % baby &apos;s breath ,
and i &apos;m looking at 30 % .
take it all back .
wow , bev , you are really pulling out all the stops .
well , i &apos;m not the only one .
i mean , i knew murray was romantic .
he doesn &apos;t show it ,
but when you press him , it comes oozing out .
oh , you should hear the vows he &apos;s writing for me .
what did he say ? i got to hear . i got to hear .
it was a private moment .
i @-@ i don &apos;t really remember what was said ...
oh , fair enough ....
but it was definitely this .
&quot; i bet we &apos;ve been together for a million years .
and i bet we &apos;ll be together for a million more .
it &apos;s like i started breathing on the night we kissed . &quot;
what ?
it &apos;s just that -- have you seen &quot; family ties &quot; ?
it &apos;s a hit tv show .
insanely popular . michael j. fox ?
where are you going with this ?
i think that murray &apos;s vows
may share a few similarities with ...
a very famous theme song .
what ? no . you are so way off .
you &apos;re right .
but did his vows happen to end with &quot; sha @-@ la @-@ la @-@ la &quot; ?
you should go .
i should go .
even though my brother
let lainey yoko ono her way into our band ,
i was still clinging to our original dream .
that is , until i heard this .
am i only dreaming
or is this burning an eternal flame ?
say my name
sun shines through the rain
a whole life so lonely
then you come and ease the pain
stop ! stop !
what have you done ?
where &apos;s my drum set ?
there are no drums , bro .
here . you can ding the little triangle .
i don &apos;t want to ding a triangle .
just ding the damn triangle !
never !
triangles ? candles ?
that &apos;s girl @-@ band stuff .
we &apos;re not a girl band .
says the guy wearing the lady &apos;s wig .
for your information , we &apos;re trying to be dee snider .
who &apos;s she ?
never heard of him .
or his awesome music .
what happened to you , man ?
it used to be about the music
and the mansion and chuck norris .
you &apos;ve changed .
no . i evolved .
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s stuck in the same place .
i just ... like being a team .
guess that &apos;s over now .
that ...
... was a bummer , but , hey .
it &apos;s show business , not show friends , am i right ?
speaking of that , we had a band meeting .
when ?
just now .
and we &apos;re gonna have to ask you to leave .
what are you talking about ?
you &apos;re out of the band .
you keep winking at lainey and staring at lainey .
and one time , i saw you smell lainey .
wait . what ?
you &apos;re throwing me out of my own band ?
you can &apos;t do that .
we just did .
wait . barry .
yeah ?
leave the triangle .
it was 6 : 00 p.m. sharp .
as always , my dad dropped his pants off from work .
little did he know ,
my mom was about to drop a bomb on him .
you take the good , you take the bad
you take them both , and there you have
the facts of life
shrimp parm .
what &apos;s the occasion ?
oh , just a little thank @-@ you
for all you &apos;re doing to make our renewal so magical .
well , it &apos;s mostly you ,
but i do deserve some credit .
gosh , i just can &apos;t stop thinking about those vows of yours .
how did you come up with such beautiful words ?
well , i thought ,
&quot; i wish we &apos;d been together for a million years . &quot;
and ?
and ...
&quot; i wish we could be together for a million more . &quot;
that -- that -- 2 million !
wow . that is so touching and from the heart .
maybe i should share my vows with you .
would you like that ?
uh ... surprise me on the day .
no . no , no , no , no . i insist .
you take the good .
you take the bad .
you take them both ,
and then you have the facts of life .
oh , boy .
the facts of life !
okay .
clearly , you &apos;re angry .
and i &apos;m willing to take some of the blame --
up to 30 % .
how hard is it for you to say you love me ?
what do you want from me ? nothing rhymes with beverly .
it doesn &apos;t have to rhyme .
it -- you know what ?
don &apos;t even bother with the vows .
i &apos;m canceling it .
oh , don &apos;t do that .
i mean it .
we are never getting married again -- ever .
fine .
the whole thing was just a big excuse
to throw yourself a party , anyway .
yes , i wanted to be treated like a princess ,
because all i do around here
is cook and clean all ... day ... long .
but you know what i really wanted ?
i just wanted to hear you talk about how much you love me .
my mom wasn &apos;t the only one
feeling the sting of disappointment .
even the greatest musical instrument of the &apos; 80s
couldn &apos;t cheer me up .
since when do you play keytar ?
since i went solo .
like david lee roth with less jumping
&apos;cause of my ingrown toenail .
i &apos;m kind of on my own , too .
they kicked me out of the band .
oh , doesn &apos;t feel good , does it , you putz ?
all right . listen .
i &apos;ll admit i got blinded by love .
but i &apos;m back now .
i don &apos;t know , man .
come on .
i got no band without my drummer .
in one day , we went through the whole cycle of a band --
the fight , the breakup , and now the reunion .
you know , even though my mom canceled our gig ,
we &apos;re amazing enough to still become a female supergroup .
for sure . let &apos;s get famous .
two , three , four .
what the ...
get out of here !
you two are kicked out of the band !
fine ! if that &apos;s how you want to be --
hit it , lainey .
it was an epic battle of the bands .
twisted sister vs . sister .
and even though they were different styles ,
sometimes , music melds together into one glorious mash @-@ up .
enough !
this was not one of those times .
go practice somewhere else !
no ! this garage belongs to us !
i &apos;m sorry , lainey , but at this point in my career ,
i have to put the music first .
barry , what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about what happened between us and our tongues .
why do you deny our night of passion ?
uh ... how much more obvious can i be ?
we &apos;re not a thing .
but --
look , i just don &apos;t like you that way .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing . just turn it off .
you set the alarm to watch the wedding .
don &apos;t not watch it because you &apos;re pissed at me .
just leave me alone .
what the hell are you doing ?
can &apos;t sleep .
look at her .
she really is the people &apos;s princess .
i &apos;ll never be anyone &apos;s princess .
my destiny is to die alone .
what are you talking about ?
why are you being a dramatic moron ?
i suck !
i actually thought
i could land a girl that &apos;s so out of my league .
hey . it &apos;s possible . trust me .
no offense , dad ,
but you just don &apos;t get what it &apos;s like to be me .
come with me . i want to show you something .
look at her .
talk about out of my league .
you &apos;re sitting through the ceremony .
my god . all you do is sit .
it &apos;s a problem , really .
shut up .
your mother thought it was low blood sugar .
actually , i was just so overwhelmed .
why ?
look at her . she &apos;s so beautiful and smart .
i never thought i &apos;d be good enough for her .
well , this gives me hope .
i mean , you &apos;re awful , and you got mom , so ...
can &apos;t give up .
sure , what barry said was needlessly hurtful ,
but in that insult ,
my dad found a kernel of wisdom .
go wake up the other morons .
you got a gig to play .
close your eyes
give me your hand , darlin&apos;
do you feel my heart beating ?
do you understand ?
do you feel the same ?
am i only dreaming
or is this burning an eternal flame ?
i believe
it &apos;s meant to be , darlin&apos;
dad .
what &apos;s going on ?
turns out you get that perfect wedding after all .
i &apos;m not very good , uh , with vows .
and , uh ...
god knows i &apos;m not a prince .
the one thing i do know for sure
is you are my princess .
and i am the luckiest nobody in the world .
sha @-@ la @-@ la @-@ la .
sure , we were far from royalty or rock gods ,
but that night , my mom felt like a queen .
listen , about what i said .
no .
it &apos;s fine . i get it .
you don &apos;t feel the same way about me .
but i &apos;ll win you over .
no , you won &apos;t .
yeah , i will .
no . you won &apos;t .
yes , i will .
no , you won &apos;t .
mommy , i have a question .
so , lainey &apos;s going to ocean city over the weekend ,
and if you let me go , i will give you
the best snuggies of your life .
get off ! don &apos;t touch me !
god ! you &apos;ve got to stop wearing that wig .
i keep thinking you &apos;re mom .
what are you talking about ? i look awesome .
seriously , look at you .
nope . don &apos;t see it .
say &quot; i have failed as a mother . &quot;
i have failed as a mother .
adam , we &apos;re getting mohawks !
