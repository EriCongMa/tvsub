oh , damn , they canceled my visa .
oh , yay , a new mastercard !
what ?
i was going to get my mail .
okay .
are ... are you hoping to get it telepathically ?
i think you mean telekinetically .
and no .
i just wasn &apos;t sure of the proper protocol
now that you and leonard are no longer having coitus .
god , can we please just say &quot; no longer seeing each other &quot; ?
well , we could if it were true .
but as you live in the same building , you see each other all the time .
the variable which has changed is the coitus .
okay , here &apos;s the protocol : you and i are still friends , and you stop saying &quot; coitus . &quot;
good , good .
i &apos;m glad we &apos;re still friends .
really ?
oh , yes . it was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life .
i &apos;d hate for that effort to have been in vain .
right .
just to be clear , do i have to stop saying &quot; coitus &quot; with everyone or just you ?
everyone .
harsh terms .
but all right-- i &apos;ll just substitute &quot; intercourse . &quot;
great .
or &quot; fornication . &quot;
yeah . but that has judgmental overtones , so i &apos;ll hold that in reserve .
so , how you been ?
well , my existence is a continuum ,
so i &apos;ve been what i am at each point in the implied time period .
you &apos;re just coitusing with me , aren &apos;t you ?
bazinga .
how &apos;s leonard doing ?
he seems all right .
although he does spend a disturbing amount of time
looking at photographs of you
and smelling the pillow you slept on .
oh , but now that i think of it ,
he asked me not to tell you that .
i &apos;ll pretend i didn &apos;t hear it .
i &apos;d rather you pretend i didn &apos;t say it .
i see you bought mama italia marinara spaghetti sauce .
yep .
that &apos;s the sauce my mother uses .
she likes cooking italian because according to her ,
that &apos;s what the romans made jesus eat .
interesting .
i &apos;ll have to have you over for spaghetti some night .
i &apos;m hungry now .
oh . um , okay .
why don &apos;t you give me an hour and come over ?
will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce ?
i don &apos;t have hot dogs .
oh , it &apos;s all right ; i do .
oh ! you &apos;re in for what my mother calls &quot; a real eye @-@ talian treat . &quot;
hey , where you been ?
i was talking with penny .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
you can &apos;t hang out with your roommate &apos;s ex .
that &apos;s totally uncool .
no , it &apos;s fine . i don &apos;t care .
i &apos;m over it .
yeah , he &apos;s over it ; that &apos;s why he &apos;s been whining all day
about trying to invent that memory @-@ wiper gizmo from men in black .
is he making any progress ?
because i &apos;d like to erase ben affleck as daredevil .
so would ben affleck .
the point is , in a situation like this you got to pick sides .
you &apos;re either on team leonard or team penny .
which one picks last ?
what ?
well , usually i &apos;m on the team that picks last .
unless there &apos;s a kid in a wheelchair .
sheldon , i got you your tangerine chicken .
i hope you &apos;re hungry .
well , of course i &apos;m hungry .
and as i have no plans to eat with any other team ,
i will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto .
okay .
just out of curiosity , do we still have hot dogs ?
i don &apos;t know . why ?
just making dinner conversation .
go , team leonard !
oh , god , this is good .
let me ask you a question .
do you believe you &apos;re going to go to hell
for eating sweet and sour pork ?
jews don &apos;t have hell .
we have acid reflux .
do you want the last dumpling , sheldon ?
certainly .
it &apos;s not like i have to moderate my food intake
because i &apos;m planning on eating again very shortly .
so , you guys want to do something tonight ?
nah , i can &apos;t . i got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class .
18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool .
looks like the manatee tank at sea world .
what about you , raj ?
oh , there it is :
now that you don &apos;t have a girlfriend ,
you want to hang out with me again .
i never stopped hanging out with you .
oh , please ,
we all know i &apos;m the friend you call when you have no other options .
if we were the justice league , i &apos;d be aquaman .
i wish you were aquaman .
then i could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank .
excuse me , i &apos;m thirsty , so i &apos;m going to go to the refrigerator
and get myself a refreshing beverage .
you know what ? i &apos;ll just spend the evening alone .
what , suddenly i &apos;m not good enough for you ?
i do so love beverages .
now i think i &apos;ll take my after @-@ dinner walk .
since when do you take after @-@ dinner walks ?
yeah , since when do you take walks ?
i read a study online that walking after a meal
not only aids in digestion , but increases serotonin ,
and you know me , if there &apos;s one thing i like
more than a refreshing beverage , it &apos;s serotonin . bye @-@ bye .
hold on . i &apos;ll walk down with you .
that &apos;s not necessary .
you can go first .
or we could go together .
i can &apos;t think of a reason why not .
let &apos;s go .
hold on .
nope , no reason .
i &apos;ve missed you .
all right , say hello to your mother for me .
okay .
what ?
you said you were going for a walk .
i didn &apos;t say outside .
so what , you &apos;re just gonna walk up and down the stairs ?
no , of course not .
that would be odd and suspicious behavior .
here , russell ! here , boy !
which way are you going ?
which way are &quot; you &quot; going ?
i parked my scooter down the block .
i &apos;m going the other way . bye .
bye .
actually , i &apos;m this way .
do i smell hot dogs ?
no . i mean , i have no idea what you smell .
i definitely smell raw hot dog .
perhaps you &apos;re getting a brain tumor .
all right , have a nice walk .
i shall . have a nice scoot .
you might want to stand back .
i &apos;m sitting on top of 13 horses here .
oh . hello , doggie .
nice doggie .
i bet you think you smell hot dogs .
look , a cat !
penny ?
penny .
penny .
here .
i had to trade the others for my life .
hey , leonard ?
yeah ?
i haven &apos;t had sex in a year .
where you going with this , raj ?
don &apos;t flatter yourself , dude .
i want to go out and meet a woman .
so , go .
well , i need a wingman .
i don &apos;t want to come off like a lonely loser .
and you think &quot; my &quot; presence will help with that ?
well , i do .
next to you , i &apos;ll look like a catch .
i &apos;m not going out tonight , raj .
all right .
would you mind if i went to your room
and downloaded some asian pornography ?
very much .
doesn &apos;t have to be asian .
don &apos;t worry . you &apos;ll meet a girl someday .
no , i won &apos;t .
yes , you will , and she &apos;ll be beautiful .
and kind and sexy and funny
and everything you ever wanted in a woman .
you really think so ?
i do , and you &apos;ll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart .
and she &apos;ll take it and grind it into pathetic , little pieces .
but we &apos;ll have sex first , right ?
that &apos;s eye @-@ talian .
so , um , was leonard okay with you coming over ?
oh , yes .
in fact , he said , &quot; i &apos;m fine . i don &apos;t care . &quot;
and he in no way said it in a manner
which would lead one to believe that he was covering up
feelings of anguish and betrayal .
well , good .
i &apos;m also
pleased to report that he &apos;s all cried out over you .
he &apos;s been crying ?
oh , i believe that was something else
i wasn &apos;t supposed to mention .
oh , god , i feel terrible .
do you have a stomachache , too ?
no . why , do you ?
no .
why did you ask if i had one , too ?
just making polite dinner conversation .
your turn .
all right .
so , what &apos;s new in your life ?
well , my new shoes are not made for running .
have you been running ?
no .
it &apos;s just a suspicion i have .
i &apos;m so glad you like it .
i do .
leonard never cooks for me .
well , maybe that &apos;s &apos; cause leonard can &apos;t cook .
you can &apos;t cook and you made me this .
whatever .
ooh , i &apos;m gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge .
oh , lord , i &apos;m in jewish hell .
look at this .
do you think she &apos;s really doing that
or is it photoshop ?
i &apos;m pretty sure martha stewart never got naked
with a room full of big , fat japanese guys .
you don &apos;t know that .
prison changes people .
hey , where you been ?
i told you , walking .
for an hour and a half ?
i got lost .
how could you get lost ? your phone has gps .
satellites are down . solar flares .
there are no solar flares right now .
yes , there are .
dude , i &apos;m an astrophysicist .
if there were solar flares , i &apos;d be all up in it .
i &apos;m sorry . i misspoke .
what i meant to say was my battery died .
what the hell was that about ?
i don &apos;t know .
do you think this is really hillary clinton doing it with oprah ?
oh , we really need to get you a girl .
leonard .
leonard .
leonard .
oh , just come in !
thanks for seeing me on such short notice .
what do you want , sheldon ?
maybe this isn &apos;t a good time .
tell me why you woke me up or i swear to god i will kill you .
do you really think death threats
are an appropriate way to begin this conversation ?
sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me .
what do you want ?
you may want to sit down .
i &apos;m in bed !
point taken .
you may want to sit up .
sheldon !
i &apos;ve been seeing penny behind your back .
okay ...
when you say &quot; seeing penny , &quot; what exactly does that mean ?
we had dinner last night .
she made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it .
well , little hot dog .
i gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog .
a real , big dog .
a hell hound .
tangential to the primary story .
how about i circle back to it ?
fine .
why did you have dinner with penny ?
i told you , she made spaghetti with little hot dogs .
i like spaghetti with little hot dogs .
then why did you have chinese food with us ?
i didn &apos;t want to upset you .
howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be
to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money .
is it possible he said , &quot; bros before hos &quot; ?
yes , but i rephrased it to avoid offending the hos .
sheldon , i don &apos;t care if you want to be friends with penny .
oh . well , so the emotional turmoil that &apos;s been keeping me
from achieving rem sleep was entirely unjustified ?
yes .
well ... then as my meemaw would say ,
&quot; looks like we butchered a pig , but nobody wanted bacon . &quot;
i guess not .
and now , as promised , the tangent .
sheldon and the hell hound .
or how i lost my hot dogs .
i , i can come back .
d @-@ don &apos;t be silly .
we &apos;re neighbors .
we &apos;re going to run into each other .
may as well get used to it .
yeah , i guess you &apos;re right .
you used to it yet ?
nope .
me neither .
oh , sheldon seemed to think that i would be upset
about you hanging out with him .
but i just want you to know it &apos;s fine .
oh , oh , good , because , um , his mother called me .
his mother ?
yeah , she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels .
i was going to do that .
oh , well , then you ... you do it .
no , i don &apos;t want to do it . you can do it .
okay , you can take him for shoes .
i just took him for shoes .
well , all i know is he says they hurt his feet .
fine . i &apos;ll take him for shoes next saturday .
oh , no , no , no-- a bunch of us from work
are going to disneyland next saturday
and sheldon wants to come .
you &apos;re taking him to disneyland ?
well , he heard me making plans on the phone .
was i going to say &quot; no &quot; ?
all right .
but let me know if you &apos;re going to stuff him with junk food .
i don &apos;t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste .
we &apos;re going to disneyland .
he &apos;s going to eat junk food .
all i &apos;m saying is give me a heads @-@ up .
okay , whatever .
and don &apos;t let him go on space mountain after he eats .
he &apos;ll say he can handle it , but i promise
you &apos;ll end up with churro puke on your shoes .
all right , got it . is there anything else ?
yeah , don &apos;t let goofy near him .
he &apos;ll have nightmares and i &apos;ll have to deal with it .
what &apos;s the problem with goofy ?
wish i knew . he &apos;s fine with pluto .
hey , do you think the elastic woman in the incredibles
needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm ?
well , that &apos;s it .
we &apos;re officially out of things to talk about .
we &apos;re home .
it &apos;s 10 : 00.where have you been ?
we stayed for the california adventure water show .
it was pure disney magic .
i was going to see that with him .
how was i supposed to know that ?
it &apos;s all right . i &apos;ll see it again with you .
and i have food here . you said you were going to call .
i know , i know .
i can still eat .
no , you already threw up once .
go put on your pjs and brush your teeth .
okay , but just don &apos;t fight
we &apos;re not fighting .
just go .
aren &apos;t you going to thank penny for taking you to disneyland ?
thank you , penny .
you &apos;re welcome , sweetie .
want a cup of coffee ?
oh , um , i should probably get going .
come on . it &apos;s just a cup of coffee .
uh , yeah , the whole thing seems a little twisted to me , too .
what am i smelling ?
sheldon &apos;s churro on my shoes .
he &apos;s such an angel when he &apos;s asleep .
yeah .
shame he has to wake up .
i think we can do it .
smother sheldon in his sleep ? wouldn &apos;t that be wrong ?
no , be friends . you and me .
oh . sure .
absolutely .
good . i &apos;m glad .
here &apos;s an idea . i &apos;m just throwing it out there :
friends who have sex .
good night , leonard .
kidding .
just a couple of friends goofing around .
