I was just at the police station visiting
and they're gonna release Andrew Campbell.
So if they don't think that he did it--
Then that person is still out there.
You girls need to take precautions.
They were supposed to give me an anti-anxiety medication
to help me sleep.
I asked them not to.'
I need that prescription.
No, you want it.
It's Sara, I-I gave her one of Caleb's phones.
It's a face chat request.
If that's Sara, who's sending this?
你们只有三十秒的时间离开那里
When we were down there in that place, we saw a name.
What name?
Charles DiLaurentis.
So one of those boys is Jason.
And the other one's Charlie.
He said your dad knows all about it.
Who is the other boy in this photo?
So what'd your dad say when you showed him the picture?
Did he admit Charles was the boy next to Jason?
Guys, give her a a a minute.
Charles is my brother.
Then, why hasn't he been living
with your family this whole time?
Charles was born 15 months before Jason.
Your mother and I knew he was
troubled at an early age.
We took him to the best doctors and therapists we could find.
What was wrong with him?
They didn't know for sure
but by the time you were one
it was too dangerous to keep him in the house
we were scared for your safety
so we had him institutionalized.
Where?
Radley.
How is it possible that nobody in this town ever mentioned him?
Nobody knew him.
We moved here after Charles was admitted.
Your mother wanted to be close to him.
I'm so sorry, Ali. Oh, God.
All roads lead back to Radley.
I don't get it.
Why wouldn't your parents tell you about him?
Why keep him a secret?
Your mother wanted to tell you, but I thought we should wait
until you got older.
Why?
I wanted you to have a normal childhood.
Without that distraction.
Distraction?
Is that what you call your own son?
He would have consumed our lives.
So you lied and told me Charlie wasn't real.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
We hoped Radley would help him.
That in time, he'd get better.
But instead he got worse.
He's the person who set me up for Mona's murder.
He kidnapped and tortured my friends.
Charles couldn't have done that.
How is your father so sure?
Because Charles is dead.
He killed himself when he was 16.
He never left Radley.
How did he do it?
He took pills.
Where did they bury him?
My dad was out of the country when it happened.
So my mom had him cremated.
He's lying.
How can you be so sure?
No body, no grave, no proof.
He's not lying, Hanna.
He would never protect someone who's tryin' to hurt us.
Two days ago, he said there was no
Charles DiLaurentis in your family.
Why believe him now?
He didn't wanna tell me about Charles because
he was ashamed of what he did.
To him, to my family.
Look, A responds to the name Charles
and clearly that home movie means a lot to him.
So that's enough reason for us to believe
that your brother might still be alive.
If we wanna rule him out, we just
have to find proof of his death.
How do we do that?
We go to Radley.
Someone who works there has to know what happened to Charles.
We can't go to Radley.
Why not?
It closed down. Remember?
Hey. I came as soon as I heard about Andrew.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm just exhausted and my head hurts
I need to go to bed.
Okay. Uh, well, your mom said I could spend the night.
I'm glad.
I like it.
You do? I-I'm not so sure.
It's a good look for you.
Thanks.
Good morning, girls.
I just got off the phone with Dr. Sullivan
and she was able to make time to see both of you today.
Dr. Sullivan is a therapist.
She works with people who've experienced trauma.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Sure.
What was that about?
Maybe she's not ready to talk yet.
She needs to speak to someone about what she's been through.
You can't force her to go.
Well, maybe not, but you were shooting
your dad's gun a couple of days ago.
So, you're going.

未找到搜索结果
Can I come in?
Sure.
Ah, I notice you've been taking pictures
the last couple of days.
Yeah, just...feels good
to focus on something other than myself.
Tanner called.
Now, that Andrew has been released
she's eager to meet with you girls.
I told her you'll need a few more days.
Thank you.
Look, if you don't wanna see a professional yet,
I-I get it.
But I just wanted you to know
that when you are ready to talk
I'm here.
I appreciate that,
but I don't need to talk about what happened.
Oh, maybe not now...
No, not ever.
I just...wanna move forward
and get on with my life, okay?
How about we do something? Just the two of us.
Let's go to a movie or mini golf?
Actually, I-I booked time to use the dark room at Hollis.
I want to develop those photos.
Um, but can I take a rain check?
Sure, uh, I can drive you to campus.
Oh, you don't have to do that.
But I-I don't want you going out alone.
But it's just to the photo studio, dad.
There's gonna be plenty of people around.
Okay, text me when you get there?
I will.
Morning, beautiful.
What are you doing over there?
I'm watching the cops switch shifts.
How long have you been sitting in that chair?
Long enough to see them switch for the second time.
Caleb, when my mom invited you to spend the night,
she meant to sleep.
I know.
I just.. I can't.
Not with what's still out there.
Nothing is gonna happen to me
with all those police camped outside.
Hanna,
there was a ten minute gap between the time
the first squad car left and the other one showed up.
A lot can happen in ten minutes.
Why don't you just come lie down?
I will. I'm gonna go talk to that cop first.
I wanna see if the other guy left early
or if he showed up late.
You really don't have to do that.
It'll just take a minute.
Operator, how can I help you?
Hi, uh, my daughter was a patient at Radley.
How can I get hold of her medical records?
Files with patients who transferred to another facility
have transferred with them,
most of the others were sent to River Hill Davis Center.
That's where they're being stored?
That's where they're being shredded.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hi.
Are you alone?
Uh, my mom just went to the bank
she'll be back in a few minutes.
Listen, um..
...how are you doing?
It's strange to be back.
Everywhere I go, everybody stares at me
but nobody says anything.
Well, it can be kinda hard to know what to say.
Yeah, I guess.
Man, I thought it was finally over.
Now that Andrew's been released...
We're right back to where we started.
That's not true.
Everybody's lookin' out for you guys.
And the police are gonna figure out who's behind this.
You really believe that?
I do.
But you need to tell them what you know.
Every little detail can help.
Oh, uh, hey, sorry, um, I used up all the blueberries.
Can you order some more?
Yeah, not a problem.
Thanks.
That's our new baker, Sabrina.
She reeks of weed, but she makes really great pastries.
It's medicinal.
You left, um..
Helps with her migraines
but it makes her a little clumsy.
Got it.
Oh, no, it's alright.
Spencer?
Spencer?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
No, I'm fine.
So if Charles died in Radley
it would say it in his patient file?
Yeah.
What if he was released?
It would be noted there too.
So if we get that file, we get the truth.
Assuming it still exists, it could be confetti by now.
Well, we have to find out one way or another.
I looked up the data center. It's 20 minutes from here.
We can't just walk in there and ask for it.
No, but I can ask for mine and then
we'll know if they've been shredded.
What if they haven't?
Then we'll check out the place, see how secure it is
and figure out what to do next.
Caleb can drive us.
No, you can't tell Caleb what we're doing.
Charles had a knife to Sara's throat, remember?
I can't not to tell him.
Em, he's barely left my side ever since
he found out Andrew isn't A.
He's outside talkin' to Spencer's mom right now.
Okay, and what about with Sara?
I don't even know the girl.
Hanna.
Fine, I'll think of something.
You okay?
Yeah, you know, just been on edge since we got back.
Yeah, it's been rough for me too.
How about you? Are those pills helping?
Mm-hmm, no, they gave me a huge headache, so I threw 'em out.
I'm just trying to not focus on what happened.
Um, why don't we meet at The Brew in one hour?
Sounds good.
Hey, Aria wanted me to pick up something for her.
我马上到
What did you do with his ashes?
Your mother scattered them on the lake.
You weren't with her?
She didn't want me there.
What about his funeral?
We decided not to have one.
What did he do to deserve that?
Were you even sad when he died?
To be honest, it was a relief.
We didn't have to worry anymore.
Well, the office manager won't give me my file.
Has to go through my doctor.
Well, that must mean they haven't been shredded yet.
Okay, well, there's only two ways into this warehouse.
Front door has a security camera and the back door's locked.
What do we do now?
Let's talk to Jason and Alison.
Maybe they can figure out a way to get his file.
Wait.
Uh, just put it on the bottom..
Put these up on the railing.
I don't see any cameras anywhere.
Or people.
You guys look for the file, I'm gonna keep an eye out.
待销毁
Did you find any Radley boxes?
Not yet.
I went to see Dr. Sullivan today.
You did?
My mom gave me no choice.
Sullivan asked if everything was okay between the four of us.
Did you say something?
I might have.
So is it?
We'll get there.
Aria found it.
So did he commit suicide or was he released?
I don't know. It doesn't say, there's..
there's no paperwork or entries past his 16th birthday.
What? That can't be everything.
No, it's not. It's just from ages 13 to 16.
That's all I could find on him.
Well, what's the last thing written in there?
His doctor recommending an increase in his medication
something called Xylotrol.
It's for severe depression.
Wait. Here's his visitors log.
There's only two people on it.
Alison's mom and someone named Carol Ward.
Carol is, um, Alison's great aunt.
Well, if she visited Charles
she must know what happened to him.
She can't help us.
Why not?
Because she died when we were in tenth grade.
Okay, just check the rest of these boxes.
Make sure that we haven't missed anything.
Go, go.
I still don't understand why you were there.
I told you.
We wanted to get Spencer's Radley file.
Thank God you're okay.
What's wrong?
I wanna make sure Sara doesn't hear us.
Did something happen?
Well, I was, uh, on campus
and I went by the photo studio
and they said you hadn't come in.
Then when I came home and you weren't here
and you didn't pick up your phone, I panicked.
I-I know, my phone died
and I mixed up the dates at the studio, I..
actually booked time for tomorrow, not today.
But where were you?
You told me you were going to The Brew.
I did.
And then we went to the data center.
Why? What'd you do, follow me?
No.
I put a tracker on your car.
You did what?
I looked for Sara everywhere.
And I finally found her, on our roof.
What-what was she doing on the roof?
I was afraid she was gonna jump.
But she was just staring up at the sky.
Said she wanted to watch the sunset.
It's my job to make sure that you stay safe.
So if you're going to Hollis tomorrow, I'm-I'm taking you.
I just said I was sorry, dad.
This is not punishment, Aria, okay?
It's just the way it has to be.
I need to know where you are at all times.
Hanna, I'm trying to protect you.
No, I want the tracker off!
The person who did this to you is still out there.
He kidnapped you once, and he could try to do it again.
Alright, look. I-I probably should've discussed it with you.
I-I know it sounds extreme but ...
you have to understand.
I spent over three weeks not knowing where you were.
Scared to death that something terrible was happening
and there was nothing that I could do to help you.
Where is Sara now?
She's downstairs watching television.
I think we acted too hastily in letting her stay with us.
You know, she doesn't wanna go to therapy
and we just don't have the tools to help her.
We can't send her back to her mom's.
Honey, if something happens to her while she's here,
I'll be held responsible.
I know, but nothing is gonna happen to her, okay?
I know what she's been through. I can help her.
Honey, I don't know everything that happened to you..
...during those three weeks.
But I know you still can't sleep through the night
and you jump every time a door shuts.
Sara was in there for over two years.
Neither of us can know what she's been through
or have any idea what it is she really needs right now.
Sabrina!
Oh, hi. Spencer?
Spencer. Yes, I'm a friend of Ezra's.
So you want to place a pastry order?
Um, not exactly. I, um...
Sorry.
I don't know if you know my story.
I do. I'm really sorry about what happened to you.
Thank you, um, it's just been
it's been really hard on me
since I've gotten back, so I was..
...hoping maybe you could sell me something
that would help calm my nerves.
Yeah. What?
Pot? Maybe some brownies?
Did Ezra tell you I could get you that?
No!
Because I am not a dealer.
No, no, no, uh, he didn't say that you were.
He said that you use it for your migraines.
I can't sell you anything.
I am so sorry.
I should not have asked. You don't even know me. I'm sorry.
Look, I said I can't sell you anything.
I'm not opposed to sharing a little bit of mine.
I'll put together a little package
for you to pick up tomorrow, okay?
Thank you.
Sara?
Sara?
What happened? Where's Sara?
She's gone.
Whatcha lookin' at?
We were so innocent back then.
And it was all a lie.
One big, disgusting lie.
Are you okay?
Would you be okay if your entire life you were told
something that you saw with your own eyes wasn't real?
I mean, they made me doubt myself.
I've...I've always doubted myself.
At least now we know the truth.
Do we?
'Cause I'm havin' a hard time believing nobody else
in this family knew about Charles.
Somebody did.
This is his Radley file.
The girls got it.
It doesn't say what happened to him.
But Aunt Carol visited him.
Aunt Carol?
Yeah.
Many times.
What is it?
Last year, when I got hurt in that elevator
and I thought Wilden was after me
I needed a place to hide out.
I knew nobody was living at Aunt Carol's, so I drove up.
But when I arrived, someone was there.
Jason? Why aren't you at the hospital?
They let me out.
What are you doin'?
Getting the, uh, property ready to sell?
No. I'm keeping the house.
And I want it to look nice.
Good, 'cause think I'd like to stay here for a little while.
You can't do that.
Why not?
There's a plumbing issue.
They had to turn the water off inside.
Well, then, I'll just stay for tonight then.
That's not a good idea. It's a mess in there.
I don't care, mom, it's one night--
I said no, Jason.
I'll be done in an hour. I'll see you at home.
Is someone in there?
That's just the wind.
And I got in my car and left.
Did you ever go back?
No.
But I always wondered why she kept the place
when no one was living there.
Maybe someone was living there.
Charles.
I can't believe you went home.
I thought maybe once my mom got over the shock of me being back,
things would be different.
Were they?
No.
Why did you sneak out in the middle of the night like that?
I don't wanna cause any problems between you and your mom.
Did she say something to scare you off?
No.
If-if you overheard anything she said yesterday--
I'm screwed up, Emily.
I know it, your mom knows it..
and you do too.
She's right. I do belong in therapy.
But it's not what I wanna be doin' right now.
What do you wanna do?
Simple things.
Take a walk on the beach.
Swim in the ocean.
I can't get back the time I lost, but..
I don't wanna waste any more of it sitting in a room
having someone analyze me.
I don't expect anyone to understand any of this.
I do.
去不了 我爸在学校等我
Doesn't look like anybody lives here.
Maybe that's what Charles wants people to think.
If he's still alive..
why would he do this?
To me, to us?
I wish I knew.
Electricity's been turned off.
I'm not your doll!
Oh, my God.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay. You're alright.
Did you see who went in there before me?
No. I was in the other room.
But whoever it was, put a wedge in the door.
That's why you got stuck.
I.. I just needed to get some air
and the door wouldn't open.
Just take a few deep breaths.
And you'll be fine. Okay?
Yeah.
I am.. I'm Clark, by the way.
Aria. Thank you.
I don't understand why your mom would keep
this smelly old house when no one's living here.
It doesn't make any sense.
We should check around the property before we go.
Okay. I'll check out that barn.
I'll go with you.
What did I do?
What did you make me do?
Spencer?
What's wrong?
Do you remember everything that Charles made you do?
Yeah. Don't you?
No.
No, not really.
I, um, I-I could barely sleep in there
'cause every time I'd fall asleep
this really loud buzzer would go off and..
...one night, finally, the buzzer didn't go off
and so I fell asleep.
Then when I woke up, my..
hands were completely covered in blood.
I have no idea what happened or whose blood it was.
And then the next morning it was gone.
You were sleep-deprived.
You probably just imagined it.
No, I..
I know what I saw.
The blood just wasn't on me, it was smeared across the floor
like somebody just dragged a body out.
Charles must've put fake blood in there
to make you think you hurt one of us.
It was just another one of his mind games.
But what if I really did hurt somebody?
Who?
We shouldn't be out here alone.
We're together. Nothing's gonna happen.
Where are we going?
It's a surprise. You're gonna like it.
Trust me.
I do trust you.
These are really cool.
Think so?
Yeah.
Yeah, especially this one.
Oop, no. That one doesn't work. I, um, used a wrong filter.
No, it's really good.
Really good doesn't cut it for National Geographic.
You work for them?
No.
But I hope to one day.
Now, that is a haunting image.
Oh, uh..
Don't really know why I took that one.
No, I love how it's framed off center like that.
You have a great eye.
But you can't be afraid to show people your work.
Get some feedback.
You'd be surprised how much it could help.
I have to go. My dad's waiting outside.
Something to remember me by?
Thanks.
Spencer, Hanna, over here.
Are you okay?
So this is why my mother didn't want me to stay here.
She didn't want me to see this.
Your dad said Charles was cremated.
She must've lied to him.
Why would she bury him here?
I guess she wanted to keep this memorial for herself.
That's why she wouldn't sell the house.
We've been down this road before.
Every time A thinks were onto him
he does something to throw us off track.
What are you saying?
I'm saying this headstone is fake.
Planted here by Charles to make us think he's dead.
That's ridiculous.
No, what's ridiculous is that you think
your brother's actually buried there.
Easy, Hanna.
No, this isn't a cemetery.
And there's no casket down there, I'll prove it.
Hanna, what are you doing?
Hanna, stop!
That's my brother's grave, you can't do that.
Watch me.
Jason.
No. Stop digging, it's real.
The grave is real.
How are you so sure?
Look at the roots wrapped around the headstone.
They've been growing that way for years.
Oh, he's right.
Nobody could've put this here.
Charles really is dead.
You led us down the wrong path
with all those stupid blocks and anagrams.
Charles is still the key to all this.
How?
A is assuming his identity.
He has the DiLaurentis' home movie.
He had to have known Charles.
Charles was institutionalized almost his entire life, Spencer.
Exactly. So he must be somebody Charles knew at Radley.
Good job.
Well, the water feels so good.
Is that a smile on your face?
It might be.
Okay. My job here is done.
Hey, how long can you hold your breath for?
A while, I was a swimmer.
Let's see.
You wanna have a competition?
Yeah.
Okay.
One...two...three.
That's it?
You know, it takes practice.
What just happened?
I forgot.
What?
What it's like to swim.
To feel weightless.
You gave me that.
I-I didn't do anything.
Nobody's ever looked out for me before.
Gettin' hungry?
Yeah, a little.
Okay, I'll, uh, go get dinner started.
Dad?
Can I show you something?
Please.
My room in that place looked exactly like this.
Except behind the window, there was a dirt wall.
There is no closet behind this door
the room was locked at all times.
There was no way for me to get out.
Hey. Sorry, I'm late.
No problem.
Your mom let me in.
How's Spencer?
She's good.
Stopped by to see if you guys wanted to grab dinner
but, uh, you weren't there.
We went out to get food.
You did?
Where? The woods?
Why do you have dirt all over your clothes?
Caleb. Stop with the third degree, okay?
Hanna, what's going on? Why are you lying to me?
What is that?
I brought some clothes.
Your mom said I could stay a while.
Well, I'd rather you didn't.
What? Why not?
Because you're suffocating me.
Okay?
I understand how hard it must've been when I was gone.
And you feel like you have to protect me now
but your constant need to keep tabs on me
is making me feel like I'm still in that bunker.
And that is not what I need right now.
What do you need?
I need a little space.
Oh, hey, Spencer.
What are you doin' here so late?
Sabrina made me some cookies.
She did?
Yeah.
Look..
...Spencer, I'm not judging.
I can't even begin to imagine what you went through down there.
And I know that coping can't be easy--
That's an understatement.
But when those wear off and they will..
...whatever is bothering you is still going to be there.
Thanks for the talk.
Spencer.
I can't sleep, okay?
My mind won't shut off.
I just, I just want to quiet the noise.
I need to quiet the noise.
Where were you tonight?
Aunt Carol's.
Carol's?
Why?
I thought somebody might..
Never mind.
You should know why we put Charles in Radley.
When you were 11 months old..
...your mother was out in the garden with Jason.
I put you in your crib to take a nap and then..
...went outside to turn on the grill.
When I came back I heard you screaming.
I ran upstairs
and found you in the tub.
The water was on...
...it was scalding hot and rising fast and..
...Charles was just standing there
watching you slip under--
Stop it. I don't wanna hear anymore.
Let him rest in peace.
