第七季 第十三集
this is just a minor setback .
no , it &apos;s not , okay ?
i &apos;ve been out here for , like , ten years .
i have nothing to show for it .
well , you have me .
i do have you .
leonard hofstadter ,
will you marry me ?
did you seriously just say , &quot; um ... &quot; ?
it &apos;s an outrage .
i know .
the university-- they think they can do whatever they want .
we just have to sit there and take it .
you need to let it go , sheldon .
you work tirelessly for someone , and this is what you get .
oh , my god !
they &apos;re just making you use your vacation days !
but i don &apos;t want a vacation .
okay , listen , i don &apos;t mean to diminish what you &apos;re going through ,
but i &apos;m a little distracted right now .
oh , this again ?
so , penny proposed , you didn &apos;t say yes ,
and now you think you may have lost her love forever .
how does this compare to me being forced
to relax for a few days ?
it doesn &apos;t !
thank you !
i &apos;m gonna go talk to penny .
i &apos;m going to go inside , put on my coziest pajamas ,
curl up with a good book
and wait for this nightmare to be over .
penny .
sorry .
hey . look , i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t text you back .
i just needed some time to think .
okay .
here . come in .
look , if you want to break up , just say it .
leonard ...
no , no , no , no . i take it back .
don &apos;t say it . just @-@ just hate me , but stay with me .
it worked for my parents .
listen , i don &apos;t want to break up with you .
oh . o @-@ okay .
good , good .
so , it &apos;s cool if i cry a little ?
yeah , i probably wouldn &apos;t .
yeah .
look , you did the right thing last night .
i was a mess .
i was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere .
look , i get it , and i want you to know
that i support whatever you want to do .
great , because i &apos;ve been thinking ,
if i really want this acting thing to work ,
i need to focus all my energy on it .
and to do that ,
i should quit waitressing at the cheesecake factory .
that @-@ that &apos;s a big step .
i know .
so , you know , before making any rash ...
i already quit .
and i support you !
come on , take me to work with you .
no .
you &apos;re on vacation .
please .
what if there &apos;s a big breakthrough in science today
and i &apos;m not there to see it ?
do you really think there &apos;s gonna be a breakthrough
without you there to do it ?
no . i was just tricking you .
bye .
leonard , wait !
take me with you.- no !
please .
no !
too bad . i &apos;m coming with you .
oh , sheldon , stay !
but ...
i said stay !
i &apos;m going to work .
do not follow me .
hey , stuart .
hey .
sorry . did i startle you ?
yes , but at this point , pretty much any customer does .
what can i do for you ?
well , i need a little help .
i accidentally destroyed one of howard &apos;s comic books this morning ,
and i was hoping i could replace it .
wow . what happened ?
batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron .
well , don &apos;t let the riddler know that .
it &apos;s a comic book joke .
or maybe it &apos;s not .
do you have this one ?
uh , well , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s pretty rare .
can you give me a few days to track it down ?
ooh , i was kind of hoping to get it
before howie comes home from work .
oh . what &apos;s the hurry ?
well , he &apos;s always saying
i should be more careful with my curling iron ,
and it seems like a dangerous precedent
to let him think he can be right .
well , i &apos;ll do what i can ,
but i can &apos;t make any promises .
you know , i do work at a pharmaceutical company .
if you can make this happen today ,
i can hook you up with anxiety medication ,
antidepressants .
really ?
do you have any of these ?
hello , mr. rat brain .
not so bitey without the rest of the rat
to back us up now , are we ?
anybody home ?
hey , what brings you guys here ?
well , we were just on our way to lunch
and wanted to see if you &apos;d like to join .
why ?
because sheldon &apos;s not here this week ,
and you don &apos;t think i have any other options ?
i &apos;m just kidding . i &apos;ll get my purse .
hi , amy . i ... oh .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t know you had any company .
that &apos;s okay .
uh , bert , this is howard and rajesh .
guys , this is bert .
hey . good to see you .
hey .
anyway , i wanted to show you
this tourmalinated quartz that we got in the lab .
this is so pretty .
bert works for the geology department .
yeah .
you know what , uh , geologists and bon jovi have in common ?
you &apos;re both into rock ?
yeah .
well , see ya .
oh , you forgot your quartz .
oh , it &apos;s okay .
i want you to have it .
bye .
he &apos;s nice .
yeah , he &apos;s nice because he likes you .
what ? ! no , he doesn &apos;t .
he brought you a pretty rock .
so ? he does that every day ... oh .
you know , if you &apos;d rather skip lunch
and hang out with your boyfriend bert , it &apos;s totally okay .
he &apos;s not my boyfriend .
are you sure ? he &apos;s tall , pale and awkward .
that sounds like your type .
should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me ?
yeah , grow up , howard . god .
what do i do ? i don &apos;t want to hurt his feelings .
maybe the problem is he thinks you &apos;re available .
does he know you &apos;re dating sheldon ?
i guess it hasn &apos;t come up .
there you go .
and does sheldon know you &apos;re dating sheldon ?
i &apos;m sorry . who are you dating ?
yeah , knock it off , howard !
hey , sheldon .
hello .
you okay ?
i &apos;m on vacation . what do you think ?
why are you sitting in the stairwell ?
leonard told me to stay .
oh . well , good boy .
where are you going ?
oh , i have a ton of errands to run .
i need to make copies of my headshot ,
send them off to agents
and sign up for a new acting class and ...
well , have fun .
okay .
you want to come with me ?
really ?
come on , boy . come on . let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go .
get in the car . come on .
all right , thanks a lot .
they have one at capital comics .
oh , that &apos;s great .
no , it &apos;s not .
i hate that place .
guy who owns it is a jerk .
he &apos;s always making me feel bad about myself .
oh , that &apos;s terrible .
what &apos;s the address ?
you know , why don &apos;t i just take you there ?
that way , i can make sure he doesn &apos;t rip you off .
oh , thanks , but i don &apos;t want you to close up .
i mean , won &apos;t you lose business ?
sorry . that was mean .
penny really quit the cheesecake factory ?
yeah .
so , what is she doing today ?
i don &apos;t know .
she already thinks i don &apos;t support this ,
so if i call , it might look like i &apos;m checking up on her .
well , do you support this ?
of course i do .
she &apos;s a great actress .
i &apos;m proud she &apos;s taking this risk .
that &apos;s nice .
you bought that ? great !
i got to call her before i forget how i said it .
hi . what &apos;s up ?
oh , how &apos;s it going ?
you taking hollywood by storm ?
actually , i &apos;m at the cheesecake factory .
you got your job back . that is great news .
i didn &apos;t want to say anything ,
but you are making the right choice .
to plunge yourself into debt right now
would be literally insane . yeah .
i &apos;m just returning my uniform .
and i support you .
before we begin your guided meditation ,
close your eyes
and picture yourself in a peaceful environment .
okay .
i &apos;m inside the cern super collider .
now , take a deep , relaxing breath in through your nose .
and let it out .
didn &apos;t see that coming .
in .
let me guess .
and out .
what was i gonna do ? two &quot; ins &quot; in a row ?
where &apos;s my lemonade ?
i didn &apos;t get it .
a fitting swan song to your career as a waitress
to forget my order one last time .
do you think quitting my job was a mistake ?
do you see me drinking lemonade ?
no . i &apos;m serious .
why do you ask ?
because leonard just pissed me off .
am i being an idiot or not ?
no , i don &apos;t think you are .
really ?
the best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100 %
of your time and energy to it .
when i decided i was going to be a physicist ,
i didn &apos;t take some other job
in case it didn &apos;t work out .
which wasn &apos;t easy because there was a lot of pressure
from ms. pierson for me to be chalk monitor that year .
thank you . i needed to hear that .
why can &apos;t leonard understand it ?
because he &apos;s not like us , penny .
we &apos;re dreamers .
yeah , i need to start cracking the window
when i leave you in the car .
hello , bert .
so , anyway , there &apos;s this big , uh , rock and mineral show
next week in santa monica and ...
listen , um , bert ,
before you say anything else , i ...
i have a boyfriend .
this is awkward .
you thought i was gonna ask you to go with me
to the mineral show .
weren &apos;t you ?
yeah .
that &apos;s very nice of you , but ...
i do have a boyfriend .
that &apos;s what you all say .
you just don &apos;t want to go out with me
because i have an off @-@ putting personality .
no , that &apos;s not true .
my boyfriend has an off @-@ putting personality , too .
like , way worse than you .
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m used to it .
i mean , i &apos;m big and weird and funny @-@ looking
and no one ever wants to do anything with me .
don &apos;t say that .
it &apos;s okay .
i know i &apos;m a monster .
no , bert , come on .
i &apos;d love to go to the mineral show with you .
sweet .
it &apos;s a date .
no , it &apos;s not .
too late !
yeah . haven &apos;t seen this many people in my store
since that korean church bus
crashed through my front window .
hey ! stuart !
jesse .
haven &apos;t seen you in forever .
look how gray you &apos;ve gotten .
my hair &apos;s exactly the same color as always .
no , i was talking about your skin .
look , uh , my friend here needs a comic book ...
and she went into your store by mistake .
good thing there was no one there to see you .
what do you need ?
oh , yeah , yeah . i got this .
right over here .
even you , sweatpants ?
free popcorn .
can i offer you a coffee ?
espresso ? latte ?
no , thanks .
how about you , stu ? mocha ? scone ?
directions to the nearest soup kitchen ?
he knows where the soup kitchen is .
it &apos;s on merton avenue .
i don &apos;t think i like the way you &apos;re treating my friend .
sorry .
you want the book or not ?
not from you .
let &apos;s go , stuart .
you know something , jesse ?
you may have a successful business
a @-@ and the kind of pink complexion
that comes with good nutrition ...
... but i have something more important .
what &apos;s that ?
friendship .
which i would trade in a heartbeat for all of this .
the mineral and rock show ?
that would be awful even without bert .
so what am i supposed to do now ?
prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring ?
this isn &apos;t funny .
i &apos;m gonna have to tell him the truth :
that even if i didn &apos;t have a boyfriend ,
i wouldn &apos;t be interested in him .
i &apos;ve heard those words so many times .
from linda nosenchuck , tammy rosenworcel ...
padma kapur , neha chowdury ...
... marci grossman , lisa mazzarino ...
... megan pincus ...
... tammy cho ...
oh , who was that girl from our starbucks ?
arlene russel !
yes ! arlene !
she wrote &quot; no way &quot; on both our cappuccinos .
poor bert .
that guy &apos;s got a rough afternoon ahead of him .
well , how would you want a girl
to tell you she wasn &apos;t interested ?
i guess , uh , i &apos;d like her to sit me down ,
look me in the eye and say ,
&quot; i was wrong . i love you . &quot;
and then maybe she could touch me in a special way .
that &apos;s how you reject a guy .
okay , i don &apos;t have time for this .
i &apos;m just gonna go find him and be brutally honest .
no , don &apos;t .
he &apos;ll be so upset .
he &apos;ll probably climb up the empire state building
and start swatting at planes .
you want us to talk to him ?
really ?
you would do that ?
sure .
we &apos;ve both been in his shoes .
we &apos;ll let him down with compassion and respect .
thank you .
let &apos;s go .
so we tell him she &apos;s a lesbian , right ?
of course we tell him she &apos;s a lesbian .
and hold three ...
two ... one .
very good .
now let &apos;s try warrior ii .
and hold .
i &apos;ve read that there are great yogis
who have such mastery over their bodies
they can draw water in through their genitals .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t think we &apos;re gonna get to do that today .
too bad .
it seems like a good way to drink a milk shake
without getting brain freeze .
and now we go to reverse warrior .
how did she get you to do yoga ?
well , to be honest , i thought she said &quot; yoda . &quot;
i &apos;m helping him relax because , unlike you ,
he supports me .
oh , how many times do i have to say it ?
i support you .
sheldon , take a break .
namaste .
okay , if you support me , what was with that phone call ?
fine . i &apos;m not sure you should have quit .
but if you care so much what i think ,
why didn &apos;t you ask me before you did it ?
oh , so now i need your permission ?
would you have asked me before you quit your job ?
yes .
i thought we were in the kind of relationship
where we make decisions together .
if i &apos;m wrong , then maybe we need to talk about
the kind of relationship we &apos;re actually in .
yeah , well , maybe we do .
i &apos;m willing to if you guys are .
can we please have some privacy ?
y ... no .
i &apos;m as much a part of this relationship as you two ,
and i think it &apos;s high time we put all our cards on the table .
yeah . for example , where is this going ?
are you two ever getting married ?
and , if so , where will we all live ?
have you thought about that ?
no .
penny ?
okay , wait . what are we doing ?
for some reason , we &apos;re planning a future
where we both live with sheldon forever .
good . now we &apos;re getting somewhere .
look , i know you think i &apos;m being reckless ,
and you might be right ,
but i need to take this shot .
yeah , no kidding .
despite what it says on her resume ,
she is no longer 22 .
i swear , i am on your side .
you keep saying you &apos;re on my side ,
but you don &apos;t act like it .
he does that to me , too .
why do we put up with it ?
listen , i could never do what you &apos;re doing , okay ?
i would be terrified .
well , it &apos;s scary for me , too .
i &apos;m fine with it .
my point is , just because i couldn &apos;t do it
doesn &apos;t mean you shouldn &apos;t .
and i &apos;m proud of you .
okay . thank you .
well , to celebrate this reconciliation ,
let &apos;s all share a milk shake .
uh , penny , you &apos;ll need a straw .
you &apos;re back .
yes , i am !
there &apos;s a few more things i want to say to you .
stuart &apos;s store is just fine ,
and he &apos;s a much nicer person than you are ,
and if you still have that comic ,
i &apos;d like to buy it right now !
no problem .
oh , you want a latte while you wait ?
no , i don &apos;t want a latte !
i want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone !
i only have chocolate chip .
well , that sounds even better !
thanks for coming to the mineral and rock show with me .
we &apos;re sorry amy didn &apos;t want to go .
really , really sorry .
who needs her when i have you guys ?
rock show !
rock show ! rock show !
rock show ! rock show !
rock show !
rock show ... !
