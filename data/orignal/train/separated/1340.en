Okay, so we got two with the quinoa base,
Basil, cheddar, topped with a poached egg
and slathered with secret sauce, right?
Yes. Okay.
Coming right up.
People love your food, Holden.
Can't keep your secret sauce in stock, man.
It's your secret sauce.
I'm happy to put your photo on the label.
Ah, it wouldn't sell without your pretty face, dude.
Hey, one thing you should think about, though, is another truck.
I'd rather stay small.
Keep it 100% clean, organic food.
You know my motto -- "Hell no to GMO."
We should head back to the restaurant, chef.
Can you swing by later so we can balance the truck's account?
Yeah, you got it.
You okay?
Yeah, um, I don't feel that well this morning.
Oh, your stomach still jumping?
Uh, it's feeling worse, actually.
Oh, well, let me take you home.
Chef, are you all right?
Holden, what is it?
Reed, call 911!
Stay back!
Holden?
Starting the day off tired?
No.
You're yawning 'cause you skipped breakfast.
You didn't eat breakfast?
No, I'm yawning because you're boring.
You know, studies show that
yawning actually increases boredom.
Hey! I got the best news!
I passed!
You passed the plumbers' apprenticeship exam?
I didn't know you were studying to be a plumber.
Tommy, that's great.
Well, I only passed by one point.
Yeah, but massachusetts has very rigorous standards.
That's a difficult exam.
I'm so proud of you.
Yeah, good job, bro.
All I got to do now is 550 hours of plumbing theory,
1,700 hours of work credits,
Take the exam to be a journeyman plumber.
52 weeks after that, I'll be a master plumber.
You can't legally fix my toilet for three years?
Yeah, technically.
Hey, Frankie, you want to bring back
Rizzoli and sons plumbing with me?
Thanks, bro, but I like the detective work.
All right, go ahead.
Tell them your other good news.
And, you, I'm gonna fix some eggs.
I'm gonna ask Lydia to marry me.
Oh, Tommy! That's great!
Oh, that's gonna be so nice for T.J.
Yeah.
Right, Frankie?
So nice for T.J.
Yeah. Who's that?
Excuse me.
So tell us how you're gonna propose.
Excuse me.
Hey, Charlie.
Hey, Frankie.
Gosh, I haven't seen you in forever.
Yeah.
Uh, this is my brother, Tommy.
Tommy, officer Charlie Hanson.
Hi. Charlie. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
I think Tommy has inherited
my father's wandering eye.
That doesn't bode well for marriage.
It'd be nice if Frankie found someone.
Although doesn't she seem a little young?
Maybe the Rizzolis aren't cut out for marriage.
I mean, my engagement ring
is still sitting in a safety-deposit box.
Well, you shouldn't wait too long to make a decision about Casey.
It's not healthy, Jane.
I would love to sit here and process,
but duty calls.
I remember when Copley Square
was just a couple of hotels.
Now it's food truck central.
Oh, my goodness! Is that Chef Holden?!
Who's Chef Holden?
He's last season's "America's best chef" winner.
The reality show?
He made the most inventive deconstructed pheasant normandy
from hearts of palm.
What happened to him?
It's not clear.
Those two were with him when he suddenly collapsed.
Is that Reed Bennet and Dalia Reilly?
Yeah. How'd you know that?
Well, I saw every episode.
Me, too.
What did you think of Chef Holden's sous-vide duck?
Oh, that technique was controversial.
You know, I-I've made the grilled watermelon
with the charred beef and fennel.
You're making me hungry.
Can you two foodies stop salivating, please?
What did the paramedics say?
He was in full cardiac arrest when they got here.
Couldn't resuscitate him.
What a shame.
You know, his name, Holden, actually means "Kind."
He donated to every food-activist group.
He put his money where his palate was.
He only served organic food.
He was perspiring heavily.
Posterior nose bleed.
Maura, are you smelling him?
Get everyone back!
Maura, your nose is bleeding.
No, Jane, get back!
Call the hazmat team now!
Folks, move back!
I need hazmat and critical-incident-response team
at Copley Plaza now.
My EKG is normal.
I'm fine. Thank you.
Maura, I really think you should go to the hospital.
It's not necessary.
Really, everybody that ate in the food truck didn't get sick.
Even the paramedics that were treating him are fine.
You touched him with gloves. Why did your nose bleed?
You know, I likely became symptomatic
because I inhaled the toxin that was on his skin.
Do you know what it is?
No.
No.
I am not stripping down
And getting sprayed with the fire hose.
We brought a shower.
Oh, so we can strip and shower there?
We'll put up a screen.
Take off your clothes and shoes now.
Put them in these biohazard bags.
Oh, man. This is a new suit.
These are my favorite shoes.
Do you know what killed him?
No, we haven't identified the toxin yet.
I'll do the autopsy.
No, Maura, you can't.
I'll wear a full hazmat suit.
As soon as the body is
sealed and safe to be moved, we'll transport it.
Please transport the food and the equipment from the truck, too.
I'll let my staff know to prepare for a biohazard.
Are Jane and Maura okay?
Yeah, they're fine.
Do you want some coffee?
Please.
The girls are changing in the car.
They didn't want to get caught dead in a paper jumpsuit.
I kind of like it. It's comfortable.
Oh, no, no.
We're gonna drink this coffee and then go change in the gym.
Maybe botulism killed Chef Holden.
I don't think so.
Dr. Isles said it had a distinct chemical smell,
like maybe a cleaning product.
So maybe it wasn't a murder.
We have to investigate all suspicious deaths,
And I'm betting dollars
to doughnuts it'll turn out to be a homicide.
I watched all his episodes.
Why would anybody want to murder that really cute TV chef?
Wow. Congrats.
Third kid. I can't even imagine.
You ought to try it, Detective. Babies are the best.
Mm. Hey, Maura.
Hey, Frankie.
Dr. Isles, these were just delivered for you.
For me? Oh.
I wonder what it is.
The return address is a P.O. Box in Cypress.
Did you order something from cypress?
No.
Well, the customs tag says "Collectibles."
I'm not a collector, unless shoes count.
That didn't sound good.
Uh, Frankie, does a suspicious mail alert
say anything about excessive postage
or having a return address as a P.O. Box?
Yeah, it says don't handle
and activate your emergency plan.
It doesn't say anything about a clicking noise if you pick it up.
I think it's a pressure switch.
Okay, you should get out of the building.
You, too, officer Jenkins. Send the bomb squad in.
No.
Initiate the evacuation procedure.
I'm gonna put my hands over yours, okay?
Notify the bomb squad.
I'm gonna help you maintain pressure.
Thank you, Frankie.
What's going on?
You need to clear the building.
It's possible the package we're holding is an explosive device.
Go outside and block the entrance, Frost.
Wait, if there was a bomb, wouldn't it have gone off
when it was handled by the post office?
No, not necessarily.
If the sender knows that it's reached its destination,
It could be remotely activated.
Did anyone call about these packages?
Yeah, a few minutes ago to check to make sure they made it here.
I think I might have engaged the pressure switch.
So, what happens if you let go?
It's like a land mine. You step on it --
when you lift your foot, it goes off.
Will you go, Frost?!
You should go too, sergeant.
I'm waiting for the bomb squad.
Jenkins, you have a new baby. Get.
Korsak...
Would you get out?! That's an order! Go!
Frost, get my mom out, too, will you?
It's gonna be okay.
Bomb tech is in position. All entrances are sealed off.
I can't believe there's only one bomb tech in there.
I just can't stand here.
Come on, Jane.
I-I will tackle you to the ground if you take another step.
It's not a simple disposal, Jane.
They can't use a robot, either.
I know, but it's Frankie and Maura in there.
That's a reassuring sound.
It means no radiation so far.
Okay. I like that.
My arms are sore!
Distract me.
Uh...tell me about your case.
That reality-chef-show guy really got poisoned?
We don't yet have a cause of death.
Wh-what happens if you guess?
Well, I guess it's a little like if you were to wear a dress.
Okay, I get it.
But there is something that's bothering me.
You mean other than this?
Why didn't the chef, who has a refined palate
and superior olfactory skills,
smell the toxin that was covering his skin?
Maybe he had a cold.
I don't think so.
What's wrong?
Come on, Jane. Stop watching that.
I-I-I can't.
Jane, give it to me.
What the hell?
What are they doing?
Are they saying goodbye?
So itchy.
Yeah? You got it? Mm-hmm.
So if I go like this, you got it?
That's good?
Okay.
Finally. Thank you, Frankie.
It's a good thing my beard grows in fast.
I didn't... scratch your skin, did I?
No. I'm fine.
The level of radiation
we're being exposed to isn't a health risk.
The level of radiation from an x-ray
is the last thing I'm worried about right now.
I really loved working on the Cafe Racer with you.
Me, too.
Me, too. I really --
I really enjoyed repairing the throttle valve.
Okay.
I'm gonna look, okay?
Yeah.
What is it?
Cylinders,
stacks of metal containers,
A circuit board. What --
there's some wiring.
"Kappa alpha."
Oh, no.
What? What is it?
If the greek letters under these stamps
say "Phi iota sigma,"
I think I know what's in the package.
You do?
Kaphis.
Coffee. I ordered it.
You ordered it from Cypress?
No. Amazon.
They sent me an e-mail months ago from Missouri.
They said they were on back
order looking for a new supplier. I forgot.
Maybe -- maybe they fulfilled my order
with a -- with a company in Cypress.
But that looks like a circuit board, and that's a wire.
I ordered a coffee maker, too.
It's probably the click that we heard.
The on-off switch.
This is not an explosive device.
How much coffee did you buy?
Oh, my god.
A lot.
You guys can let go now.
Okay.
Oh, my gosh, I can't move my hands.
Okay. Ohh.
Okay. There. Okay.
I'm so sorry for the trouble.
Hey. It's okay.
This is gonna be something I never forget.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh, my god. Ohh.
Come here. Come here. All right.
Holden Hathaway is a well-nourished 32-year-old male.
His blood work showed he was suffering
from hypoxemia with hypercapnia.
And that confirms what I'm seeing in his otherwise healthy heart.
Yes, I noticed something strange
about his otherwise healthy heart, too.
Cause of death -- cardiac arrest
brought on by respiratory failure.
Did he know he was nose-to-nose with such a dangerous toxin,
and it might have a disastrous outcome to all who knew him?
He was helping me with an uncomfortable sensation.
We're on speaker, Maura.
It's all right.
If you're talking about coffee-pot gate
and your brother playing twister with the medical examiner,
Everybody knows.
I had pruritus.
Yes, that's -- that's Dr. Isles' way
of saying she had an itch.
Yes, pruritus, given the situation that I was in,
could only be relieved with scratching.
Toxins, Dr. Isles.
Let's -- let's talk toxins.
Well, based on the patterning of acute urticaria,
cyanosis, cardiac arrest, and the odor that I detected,
I had Susie run tests for organophosphates on his skin.
I think I have it. It's dichlorvos.
What's dichlorvos?
Uh, it's a common organophosphate.
It's used in insecticides. It's a neurotoxin.
Like bug spray?
Well, I can't confirm it was a spray.
But I can confirm that that's what killed him.
Uh, do you have the results from the GCMs on his clothing?
Uh, he's got traces on his pants and his shoes.
But the chef's coat he had on was just saturated with it.
The hazmat team is still processing the truck.
I'll have everything field-tested.
Okay, and I'll have CSRU check for it
in chef Holden's restaurant, car, and home.
What are you doing down here?
I didn't realize you'd been promoted... to my lieutenant.
You can't go in there.
What? It's hazmat protocol.
I, uh... need you to track down
Chef Holden's chef coats.
Sure.
It was really brave of you to stay with Maura
and hold that package.
It was coffee pods.
Yeah, but you didn't know that.
Frankie, is it possible that
a high-stress situation has...
intensified a... crush?
No.
You might as well know. I've liked her for a long time.
You know she's practically family.
And you work together.
So?
So you shouldn't mess around with people you work with.
It's pretty ironic that somebody
dosed Chef Holden with insecticide.
How ironic?
Well, he was all about organic foods, you know?
No insecticides, no GMOs in anything he served.
What's a GMO?
Wh-what you're about to put in your mouth --
Genetically modified organisms.
Hey, do you think a cookie
made with this GMO stuff is safe to eat?
Mm, it's unclear.
The European union banned GMOs,
and there haven't been any long-term safety studies.
Maura, can you trace the insecticide
on his chef's coat by brand?
No, dichlorovos has the same chemical structure
in every insecticide.
I've been digging into Chef Holden's life.
Did you locate any family members?
Yeah, his parents live in Hong Kong.
No girlfriend or wife.
What about these two chefs that were with him when he died?
They met on "America's best chef."
I've been watching clips.
Yeah, it was an extraordinary season,
particularly the finale.
Dalia, tell us about your finale dish.
I made a seared sweet bay scallop
with a horseradish beurre blanc.
Grilled kale and fig...
Way to ruin perfectly good seafood.
Reed, what about your dish?
Well, I love comfort food, so here's my twist.
Fricassee of sweetbreads and oyster mushrooms
with mashed sunchokes.
Nothing comforting about fricasseed sweetbreads
and sunchokes, if you ask me.
I've made a deconstructed pheasant normandy
with onions, apples, peppercorn, apple brandy...
What an astounding imagination.
This was a tough one for us.
Not for me. I'd send them
all home and order a pizza.
Dalia, you are America's third-best chef.
We all love your witty saporific take
on French nouvelle cuisine.
Congratulations.
No wonder you like this show.
No one says "Awesome."
Reed, you are America's second-best chef.
That means that you, Chef Holden,
are america's best chef.
So, they lose to Holden, but they end up working for him?
Uh, Chef Holden won $150,000
to start his restaurant.
He brought Dalia to help.
Chef Holden's farm to table.
It's impossible to even get a reservation.
"The organic French farm-style menu
is rife with amusing, inventive dishes
like a playful take on a mint and coconut soup."
Maura.
Oh, I would love to eat there.
All right, what about Reed? What's his story?
The runner-up, Reed, didn't get famous.
He went back to his old job at a hotel.
Holden hired him to run a food truck.
Any indication Dalia or Reed weren't getting along with Holden?
Oh, yeah. Dalia and Holden were a couple.
Chefs are the new renaissance men.
They broke up when he got famous.
Dalia posted this.
"End-of-romance rage
makes me want to put a cockroach in his food."
Maybe she decided Holden was the cockroach.
And it was time to exterminate him.
Yeah, we broke up, but we stayed friends.
We had a business to run.
We're gonna need to take his computer.
It's got all the records for the restaurant and the truck.
We'll get it back to you.
Did you have any employees
who might have had an issue with their boss?
No way. You couldn't not like the guy.
I lost to him, but he still became my best friend.
He was super-cool and super-generous.
He had a moral compass like I've never seen.
We all wanted to be like him.
Even when he was offered millions for his company,
he wouldn't sell out -- I mean, who does that?
Were there any companies that didn't like
hearing the word "No" for an answer?
Only one I can think of is Copley Square Foods.
They kept trying to schedule a meeting with him.
Copley square foods. They're --
They're the biggest contributor to the anti-GMO labeling lobby.
Chef Holden was an anti-GMO activist.
He got us all on board with environmental issues.
He even spent his own money
to lease us all green cars.
Even got me to use environmentally friendly wax on my car.
Where did he keep his chef's coat?
Which one?
How many does he have?
Dozens.
Changed three or four times a night.
Couldn't cook unless he had on a clean coat.
It was his lucky charm.
He had them everywhere --
home, car, truck, here.
Okay, could you show us the ones you have here?
Excuse me.
Hey, Maura.
Jane, I found something odd.
I couldn't understand why Chef Holden
couldn't detect the odor of the dichlorovos,
But I'm looking at medical records
from an E.R. visit six months ago.
His olfactory nerve was severed in a car accident.
Isn't that connected to his ability to taste?
Yes.
So how could he get a five-star review
after he lost his ability to taste?
I don't think he did.
I think someone tasted for him.
Detective Rizzoli,
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Hey, Hope, what are you doing here?
It's about Maura.
What, do you need another body part?
She returned a gift.
It's...my necklace, and it was meant for her.
You didn't give that to her.
Your real daughter, Cailin, did.
That's not fair.
You're the last person to talk to me about fair.
Hope, you only show up when you want something, so spit it out.
What do you want this time?
Her forgiveness.
You just don't get it, do you?
You made it very clear that it was pretty inconvenient for you
to find out that Maura was still alive.
That's not true.
It's not?
You told her she wasn't yours
and then accused her of scamming you.
Well, I was --
It was shocking.
So was showing up again and asking her for a kidney.
Be happy she has the decency to talk to you at all.
So many things I know I've done wrong.
Yes.
Like standing by your man and treating his wounds
after he murdered lieutenant cavanaugh's wife and baby.
I told the grand jury everything.
I will be a key witness in the trial,
And I will be the reason that Paddy is put to death
If he's found guilty.
Hope, for all we know, you made a deal.
I did not make a deal.
Then why hasn't the I.R.S. closed down your M.E.N.D. Clinics
and frozen all your assets?
I turned over all the books.
The I.R.S. Knows where to find me.
Yeah, well, so does Maura.
I need her forgiveness.
Here's the pain you can't undo.
Paddy is a gangster, and you're a liar.
It's not really the happy ending she was hoping for.
Excuse me. I have a suspect to interview.
No one could know that he wasn't the chef
behind the restaurant, behind chef Holden foods.
He was the name. Holden was the brand.
And you, a classically trained chef,
had to become his tasting beard.
I guess, if you want to put it that way.
Well, it had to have been tough.
It wasn't ideal.
You were driving the car
that injured his olfactory nerve, weren't you?
And you stayed and you cooked and you helped build his restaurant
because you felt responsible for his injury.
I was responsible.
Was the crash deliberate?
You called it an "End-of-romance rage."
You sent that out right before the crash, didn't you?
Look, I was angry.
He broke up with me and then asked me for a ride home.
He said it wasn't working out as a couple
because of the restaurant.
When he didn't die in the car crash, did you try to poison him?
No.
That's not what happened.
Poison?
I loved him.
I chose to stay behind
and help him with the restaurant.
After he dumped you.
I had to make peace just being near him.
It had to be enough.
We got to let Dalia go.
We don't have anything to tie her
to the poison that killed holden.
I got 10 coats from the dry cleaners.
Naturally clean & bright.
Just because they say they're eco-friendly doesn't mean they are.
Any trace of insecticides?
No.
Did you check the cleaners?
CSRU went through the whole place.
They use natural insecticides --
Onions, garlic, and cloves.
How many other chef's coats did you recover?
10 clean, 7 dirty ones in his house,
3 clean in his car, 4 in the truck.
And 5 from the restaurant.
The crime lab's still processing them all.
So far, nothing in his restaurant, home, or car
showed any trace of dichlorovos.
Hazmat incident commander didn't find
any sign of insecticides in the food truck,
So they released that, too.
So the only thing contaminated was a chef's coat
that only Holden would wear.
What are you doing?
I was thinking about chef Holden's inability
to smell the organophosphate on his chef coat.
It's a subtle smell, but I can smell it.
You could sell a fart in New Hampshire, Maura.
Look at these two bottles of his secret sauce.
That one's darker.
Yes.
Now...taste them.
Taste them?
No, we're in the crime lab.
It's not very appetizing.
Maur--
Just just taste it.
It's good.
Now try this one.
Tastes the same.
If you're not a super-taster, it does.
I think I've just been insulted.
Well, I did some DNA sequencing.
And do you know what the secret ingredient is
in chef Holden's secret sauce?
Ketchup.
Saffron.
This sauce is $49 a bottle.
Wh-- for hot sauce?!
Well, it's $5,000 a pound for saffron.
Come -- that's not possible.
It takes up to 500 flowers to make one gram of saffron,
which could explain --
which could explain why he started to use
genetically modified saffron,
which is only $10 a pound.
But he was against using GMOs.
Okay. Let's get something to eat. I'm starving.
What are you...?
What? You're always telling me to eat more greens.
This will disguise the taste of Brussels sprouts. Come on.
I liked this place better when they covered everything
in salt and grease.
I think I like Maura.
You can't like Maura.
Why not?
Because it's Maura, that's why.
You did.
Yeah, I mean...
She's hot and smart and has got a great ass,
but, Frankie, she's like our sister.
She didn't feel like my sister when I had my hands on her.
Dude, just stop. You can't.
Why not?
Promise you won't hit me?
Depends on what you say next.
You and Maura -- you don't match.
Hey, guys.
I was just headed out.
What is the update on the rest of Holden's chef coats?
Uh, the crime lab said they had
no trace of insecticides on any of them.
Hey, Frankie.
Hey, Charlie!
I owe you a beer.
You do? Okay.
Cool. Come on.
All right.
Good night.
Frankie.
Yeah?
Thanks for holding my hands today.
Anytime.
Two?
Thanks.
I'm sure glad I checked out that cop's ass.
Excuse me?
It made me realize I want to get married...to Lydia.
Oh, well, that's very sweet, Tommy.
You know what? Check it out.
I got her a ring!
Ooh! It's an amethyst!
That's a lovely color.
That's really pretty, Tommy.
Lydia likes purple.
I'm gonna go show Ma.
She'll be thrilled.
See you.
Bye.
What's wrong?
I don't like how I'm feeling. It lacks integrity.
Okay, I'm lost.
Tommy's just so excited to go share his news with your mom.
I just -- I feel a little jealous.
I always wanted that kind of a relationship with my mother.
I mean, Constance isn't warm and fuzzy,
but she loves you, Maura.
I always knew I was adopted.
When I was young and I felt lonely,
I would tell myself,
"Someday my real mother will appear."
Hope came to see me today.
What?! Why didn't you tell me?
Okay. All right, why? Why did she come and see you?
I think she wants to make amends.
Well, she doesn't need to. I'm over it.
You're not over it, and you shouldn't be.
Yes, I should. And so should she.
Maura, Hope knows how I feel about her,
and she swallowed her pride and she came to see me anyway.
So what more does she want? I talk to her when she calls.
Yeah, you talk to her
the same way that you talk to that neighbor
that over-waters your roses.
Which are on my property --
and I was very polite to him
when I told him to fix his sprinklers.
All right, so, you know, why --
why would you be Hope's advocate?
I'm your advocate.
Now I'm lost.
Well, admit it. It bums you out, doesn't it?
Maura, nobody's gonna judge you
if you change your mind about her.
Frankie.
Um, would you like to try the coffee?
Sure.
I feel a little ridiculous.
Why? You shouldn't.
Everything about that box was suspicious.
It could easily have been a bomb.
But it wasn't.
You know, sometimes we think that something is more than it is.
Yeah.
I-I don't really have time for coffee.
Thanks, though.
Just wanted to make sure you were okay.
I'll see you around.
Why would Holden pay off a gang banger?
What do you mean?
Um, Shabazz Jones -- I recognize his name.
He's with the Huntington Avenue Raiders.
Look, you see that, under "Truck Security"?
600 bucks a week's going to Shabazz.
He's on parole for assault and battery.
Who'd he go after?
A food-truck owner.
Shabazz was shaking down Holden's food truck.
Maybe Holden got tired of paying.
How many times I got to tell you this ain't your spot!
You can't park here! Get the hell out of here.
Hey, Shabazz? You can't touch people, man.
Hey, be cool, little mama.
I know every food truck around here.
I can get you free food for a lifetime.
That's all right. I brought my money.
Thank you.
That should cover for the food he stole.
Give me that.
That's my order.
No, you just ordered one assault and battery and two robberies.
Let's go.
You were threatening the owner of that truck.
You told him he couldn't park there
because he wouldn't pay you -- that right?
I don't like his pulled pork.
I do. What about you, Frost?
Delicious.
Now, I see here...
you like to beat up food-truck owners.
Says you were arrested for hitting the owner
of Chubby Chocolate Treats with a tire iron.
Yeah, we got in a scuffle. So what?
So you trade in your tire iron for some bug spray?
Some what? What the hell is she talking about, man?
Chef Holden. He got tired of paying your rent?
That was my only steady gig.
Pretty dumb to kill him, then.
Why would I kill him? I was on his payroll.
Yeah, we know that. What do you think you're doing here?
Look, I wasn't shaking him down, if that's what you're thinking.
I provided a service on the payroll.
You can talk to my man Reed.
Reed Bennet? The guy who ran Chef Holden's truck?
That's the one.
Now, why would he pay you?
'cause they needed me.
I held that space for that truck every day.
600 bucks to do that.
Yeah, that... and keep my homies
away from that truck during prime business hours.
Suits don't like gangsters.
Wait, wait, wait, what -- what prime business hours?
When the suits got hungry.
Reed said they was trying to hook a whale or something.
What does that mean?
The hell if I know.
Book him for assault and battery.
Come on. You don't want to do that.
Yeah, I do.
Wow. This is crazy.
Shabazz said that Reed paid him
to make sure the suits had access to the food truck.
The -- the food suits, maybe?
Well, Reed parked it
right in front of Copley Square Foods.
That place is full of food suits.
And Dalia said that they kept trying
to schedule a meeting with Holden.
Hey, what's up?
Oh, it can wait.
I just -- I just found this sauce in my bag.
Hey, research on Olympic medalists is curious.
Who would you guess is
the least happy -- gold, silver, or bronze?
Bronze. You finish third.
No, they're actually the happiest because they medaled.
The least-satisfied are those who finish second.
Korsak, can you play back the finale
of "America's Best Chef"?
Yeah.
Reed, you are America's second-best chef.
But we all love your secret sauce. Congratulations.
It's the secret sauce.
Chef Holden was opposed to GMOs.
There's no way that he would have allowed
genetically modified saffron in it.
But his olfactory nerve was severed,
so he couldn't taste the difference.
Yeah.
Is Reed Bennet's employment contract on Holden's computer?
I think Reed wanted to sell
his secret-sauce recipe to Copley Foods,
but there's no way that Holden would've agreed to that.
Because a mass manufacturer
would most certainly use a cheap GMO saffron.
The only way Reed was gonna get rich
was to get rid of Chef Holden.
And Chef Holden inadvertently gave him the keys.
Listen to this.
"In the event of my death,
"I leave the food truck and secret sauce
to Reed Bennet to manage as he sees fit."
I'm not sure if this helps,
but Susie just found something else on the chef's coat --
environmentally friendly car wax.
Yeah, that helps.
Hey, Chef.
Hello.
Do you have something on Chef Holden's death?
Yeah!
We'll have a lot more once we've looked at your car.
Why would you look at my car? I --
Chef Holden's face was everywhere,
and you were stuck slinging quinoa on a food truck.
It was smart of you to turn the suits at Copley
on to your secret sauce.
Were you going in to sign a contract?
What contract?
I'm here out of courtesy.
You heard Dalia say they wanted to meet Chef Holden.
Yeah, you made a lot of courtesy visits.
Visitors parking log recorded you six times
this last six months.
Is this the sauce with the GMO saffron?
There's no GMO in our stuff.
That's not what Dr. Isles found.
The DNA profile was conclusive with the bottle I tested.
It contained genetically modified saffron.
You saved a pile of money, Reed,
Paying $10 an ounce instead of $5,000.
You almost had a deal,
if you could just deliver Chef Holden.
That wasn't gonna happen. He wouldn't sell out.
"Hell no to GMO."
Ah. Oh, stand back.
I wouldn't want you to inhale bug spray.
It's positive for dichlorovos.
And it's quite a dark red,
which means it still has a heavy presence of insecticides.
Did you lay it over the hood and spray it right here, Reed?
He couldn't even taste anymore.
I let him sample the stuff with the GMO saffron in it.
He said it was great.
Is that when you decided to kill him?
Hell of an opportunity.
Test your product, get the suits on board,
then kill the man, keep the brand.
Dalia and I were the real chefs.
And he got all the credit.
He was the celebrity chef, pretty face,
and his noble cause.
I was the runner-up! I should have won!
If I had, none of this would have happened!
You think about that when you're working at a prison kitchen.
What's remarkable about saffron
is everyone's palate experiences it differently.
I wonder what's gonna happen to Chef Holden's Foods now.
Dalia's just gonna keep it going, yeah?
Well, that makes me feel better.
Mmm! Hi, girls!
Hey, Ma.
Try these cakes.
Wedding cakes?
Did Lydia say yes?
No, he didn't ask her yet.
I'm just getting a head start.
Tart with a crisp, acidic, adult finish.
Maura.
Can you get that?
Yeah. Sure.
Oh, is that strawberry?
Bubble gum. Tommy's favorite.
May I come in?
Of course you can.
Is everything all right?
No, it isn't.
Hey, Ma, why don't we go pick out
the font for the invitations?
Well, I haven't picked out the card stock yet.
Okay, we'll fluff pillows. Come on.
Please don't go.
I made a decision today.
I am closing my clinics.
Why would you close M.E.N.D.?
Because I want you to know how sorry I am.
And I want to make restitution somehow.
Wait, wait, closing clinics
that are saving desperate mothers and -- and children?
I-I don't -- I don't want that.
That's not gonna make up for anything.
I need your forgiveness
and for you to accept me, flaws and all.
I can't.
Please.
You are my daughter.
I'm not your daughter.
Maura.
Whether you like it or not, you're both related.
I've changed.
I wouldn't make the same decisions today.
So please give me... a chance.
You know, you never answered my question.
Does this bum you out?
Yes.
Okay.
I mean it, Maura.
No judgment.
Please, can we just start over?
People change.
Life changes us.
There is... research proving the elasticity of the brain.
You want to start over?
Very much.
Go outside.
Outside your house?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I like this plan.
Okay, what's going on?
Would you...
You can knock now.
Hello.
I'm Maura Isles.
I'm your... biological daughter.
Hello. I'm Hope Martin.
I'm your mother.
And I have always wanted to know you.
Oh, this is so touching.
Ma.
Would you like some tea?
Yes.
From the Ya'an, Sichuan province?
Yes!
No one I know likes that tea.
'Cause it's panda-poop tea.
Yes.
Okay, um, I'm gonna go get some frozen yogurt.
What do you want?
Chocolate with a vanilla swirl.
Oh, uh, I'll have what Angela's having.
And I'll have the same.
But can they not swirl?
Can they at least touch?
I guess.
That's real progress, Maura.
