oh , great. we &apos;ve got the prius that can
make dinner reservations , buy movie tickets ,
tell us the weather .
i just want one that opens .
maybe we should &apos;ve got that one .
mitchell !
oh , oh , my god ! teddy !
cam , this is teddy .
teddy , teddy , teddy .
doc--doctor teddy !
teddy was mitch &apos;s one significant
boyfriend before me .
uh , mitch had recently just come out .
and as he put it ,
it was hard to love someone else if he couldn &apos;t love himself .
i actually said those words ?
ugh . it &apos;s kind of hard to love myself right now .
you were the one who said , &quot; i need some time .
i &apos;ll call you when i heal more . &quot;
ten years later ...
i never said that .
time to heal more ! that &apos;s so sweet and sensitive .
why did you kill that part of yourself ?
you know , i &apos;m hosting a fund @-@ raiser for the hospital this weekend
at that roller rink on south main .
any chance you guys can come ?
yeah . absolutely .
possibly .
we &apos;ll be there .
okay .
great . so 4 : 00 saturday .
i &apos;m so glad i bumped into y &apos;all .
us , too . say bye , lily !
bye , lily .
i taught her that , so ...
bye , lily .
bye . bye , teddy .
oh , my gosh , he &apos;s great !
you &apos;re okay making plans with my ex @-@ boyfriend ?
um , yes . it &apos;s been a hundred years .
plus , this is one of the many benefits of being gay .
we can be friends with our exes
without all the petty jealousy
straight people go through .
well , i guess i am friends with pepper , so ...
i went on one date with pepper . one .
when are you gonna stop bringing it up ?
when you stop reacting like that .
daddy loves pepper .
i taught her that .
that &apos;s private .
oh , sorry . but why do you have all of our names down on a list ?
it &apos;s for my school essay--
pick a hero in your family
and write about why you &apos;ve chosen him or her .
you &apos;re still in the running ,
but i &apos;m not loving that you &apos;re drinking wine while watching my brother .
well , it was from an open bottle of white in your fridge , so ...
it &apos;s about judgment , claire .
it &apos;s not the 70 &apos;s . we know better .
there was lipstick on the bottle .
there are my babies !
how was dinner ?
perfect .
i had a steak , i had some ice cream ,
gloria found a hair in her fish ,
and it didn &apos;t cost us a penny !
it might have been my own hair ,
but jay was so happy that i didn &apos;t say anything .
what ?
honey , you got a second before you go ?
i wanna talk to you about something .
all right . why is she smiling at me like that ?
it &apos;s good news .
okay .
you remember bob from my office ?
yeah , uncle bob . the one who did the trick
where he pulled a quarter out of my ear .
he learned another trick .
he pulled 50 grand out of our pension fund .
oh . i fired him .
but the worst part is ,
i was grooming him to take over the company .
but there &apos;s an upside .
he wants you to work for him .
i know it &apos;s just a job right now ,
but you know that he has this thing going on in his chest ,
so you never know where
you &apos;re going to end up , claire .
gloria . gloria , it &apos;s a cold .
anyway , look ,
i know you &apos;ve been wanting to get back out there ,
and i always kind of thought that if you did go back to work ,
you &apos;d come back to work with me .
i @-@ i worked there for half a summer 20 years ago .
and it-- it was terrific , honey .
listen , obviously , we &apos;ll start you out slow .
we &apos;ll give you time to re @-@ learn about the place ,
and then maybe move you up . you know , you do know a guy .
he means him !
it &apos;s a wonderful opportunity , dad . thanks .
could i--could i think about it ,
talk to phil ?
oh , sure .
i &apos;ll call you tomorrow .
all right . all right . all right .
where &apos;s my boy ? give me my boy .
here &apos;s your man .
here &apos;s your little man . oh , love him .
what did i say about these flowered blankets for him ?
he &apos;s starting to take after hugh hef @-@ nerd over there .
very amusing , jay .
let me just get your name down here .
another brochure from a community college .
you know , i bet mom is having them send these .
really ? you don &apos;t think they &apos;ve targeted you
as a must @-@ have recruit ?
at least this one doesn &apos;t have that fakey lunchtime shot
of the black guy , asian girl , and an indian--
oh , wait ! there it is .
wow , that wheelchair kid is really cracking everybody up .
girls , your mom &apos;s on her way home with dinner !
i never got this .
if he sees it , we &apos;ll have to talk about it .
what ?
what what ?
if grandpa calls , i &apos;m not home .
what happened ?
he wants me to work for him .
like , groom me to take over or something .
i don &apos;t know how i &apos;m gonna say no .
why would you say no ?
i thought you were looking for something .
we could use the money , too ,
especially if haley decides to go back to school .
oh , is she still throwing out those college brochures ?
just tossed one now .
who does she think empties the trash ?
you know what really sucks ?
that job could be great .
but my dad is a terrible boss . he is so mean .
&quot; princess , coffeepot &apos;s not gonna wash itself . &quot;
that &apos;s where you got that ?
i said it to you one time .
well , you just gotta tell him straight up , man to man .
woman to man . you &apos;re very shapely .
i know . i will .
it &apos;s just i hate it so much .
the--the four big times that i disappointed him ,
it devastated me .
i mean , the first time , i cut off all my hair .
i went to college out of state .
i crashed his vintage jag into a wall .
that &apos;s only three .
kids , dinner !
oh , loving this already .
if no one gets a concussion ,
we &apos;re totally coming back .
so listen , if at any point you &apos;re not okay
with seeing me and teddy together ,
just please let me know , and we can go .
oh , well , thank you . and if at any point
you &apos;re not okay with me being so okay with it ,
you let me know .
teddy ! teddy ! hey !
aw , look at you !
this shirt is fantastic . you &apos;re adorable .
you &apos;re adorable !
oh , i think somebody has a crush !
thank you so much for having us .
i don &apos;t know which one of my girls is more excited .
okay . come on , let &apos;s get you some skates .
i want teddy to come .
oh , honey , i @-@ i &apos;m sure teddy has other things--
no , no ! you guys go ! catch up .
i &apos;ll lace up .
okay .
okay , ready ?
have fun , okay !
hey , uncle cam !
oh , my gosh ! hey ! what &apos;s--what &apos;s going on ?
what--what are you guys doing here ?
teddy invited us .
you guys know teddy .
yeah , totally .
yeah , teddy &apos;s great .
heads up , amateurs !
it &apos;s time to rock &apos; n &apos; roll ! do you get it ?
cam , what are you doing here ?
oh , hell , it &apos;s dad .
whose dad ? not your dad .
i have been avoiding his calls all day .
quick , phil , slingshot me .
all right .
oh . limbo skate , kids .
how low can you go ?
i &apos;m at a roller rink with my family
on a saturday night . i win .
i have got to get a photo of lily .
teddy &apos;s making her giggle so hard .
oh , well , everybody loves ... teddy , so ...
but you &apos;ll let me know if you &apos;re not okay .
mitchell , do you know your entire family &apos;s here ,
invited by your ex @-@ boyfriend ?
phil and claire , jay and gloria ,
your cousin pete .
c--it &apos;s a-- it &apos;s a fund @-@ raiser , all right ?
i &apos;m sure he just invited everyone on his contact list .
oh , well , that makes sense .
yes , of course it does .
and ... i &apos;m flattered .
why are you flattered ?
you know .
i don &apos;t .
you do !
i really don &apos;t !
gloria , throw on those skates and take a whirl with me .
oh , i totally would ,
but i &apos;m taking care of lily and she doesn &apos;t want to .
oh . yes , i do .
no , you don &apos;t . you told me before .
you don &apos;t remember ? why would i lie ?
gloria .
you don &apos;t know how to roller @-@ skate .
of course i do . i know how to do everything .
i can &apos;t lie to that face .
it &apos;s a good thing that we &apos;re not married .
well , i don &apos;t ...
i can &apos;t skate . i am an elegant woman .
that means that i never do
the few things that i don &apos;t really do that good .
but i &apos;m a natural teacher .
but i &apos;m going to look stupid .
gloria ...
trust me .
as long as you &apos;re standing next to me ,
you will not look stupid .
oh , thank god ! there is no place to sit .
always room at my table for my darling nieces .
uhh ... you beat us to it .
we were gonna ask this kid if we could share .
well , he was just leaving .
yeah , you can totally sit with us .
you know , i debated even putting you two on here .
whoa , fancy .
yeah , i know . well , i did used to work here .
w @-@ w @-@ wait . you &apos;re the claire from the bathroom ?
oh , is it still here ?
y @-@ yeah ... oh ...
oh ! hey ! look at you two catching up
after all these years .
well , it hasn &apos;t been that long .
it &apos;s been like a month since you came by
when alex had the flu , right ?
oh , no kidding !
well , i do get a home @-@ cooked meal out of it .
plus i owe these guys .
phil helped me buy my last two houses .
oh . so good . such great stories .
yeah .
hey , you !
you owe me a phone call !
i know ! i &apos;m gonna call you !
hey ! teddy &apos;s here , huh ?
hey , you deadbeat , you owe me 50 bucks for the golf .
well , maybe i &apos;ll slip it to you during your next prostate exam .
i &apos;ll bet you &apos;re counting the days , you perv .
oh . so funny .
you and jay really seem to have a thing , don &apos;t ya ?
and gloria--what &apos;s the nature of your relationship with her ?
well , actually , we just met tonight .
you know , i &apos;m not so sure she likes me .
really ?
uh , well , i mean , she just takes a little time to warm up .
oh , thanks . and thank you , again , for coming tonight .
with the money we raised , we &apos;ll be able
to inoculate over 4,000 needy kids
against some truly awful diseases .
and how well do you know luke ?
i love that movie , too !
yeah , that cool fight scene on that skyscraper in shanghai--
it really made me want to go to japan .
why ? shanghai &apos;s in china .
i &apos;m just saying , you don &apos;t want to fly to japan ,
get in a cab and say , &quot; take me to downtown shanghai . &quot;
it &apos;s a pretty expensive ride .
uh , um , i &apos;m gonna go to the bathroom .
come with me .
be right back , guys .
uh , what do you think you &apos;re doing out there ?
i &apos;m flirting .
that &apos;s what i was afraid of .
look , i &apos;m not gonna pretend i &apos;m stupid
just so a boy will like me .
of course not .
but you don &apos;t have to put the poor guy to shame .
flirting with boys is about increasing your value ,
not decreasing theirs .
that &apos;s a complicated thought . what magazine taught you that ?
you &apos;re doing it again ! the mean thing .
can you even hear it or what ? !
i heard it .
good .
so now that he knows that you &apos;re smart ,
let &apos;s work on being nice .
wanna ditch the hoodie ?
no .
that &apos;s all good . it &apos;s a process .
man , tough finding a hero in this family , huh ?
you know , i &apos;ve got problems of my own .
i can &apos;t always be the lovable sidekick on &quot; the manny show . &quot;
did you even notice i &apos;m binge @-@ eating ?
you &apos;re really going through something .
wanna talk about it ?
not even a little bit .
and don &apos;t go hounding me like you always do .
well , thanks for restoring my faith in this family .
too bad i &apos;m not related to teddy .
he seems terrific .
doesn &apos;t he , though ?
knees bent .
arms loose . chin up .
butt out .
ay , no , phil . this is too much .
no , just remember , &quot; kbalcubo . &quot;
k @-@ b @-@ a @-@ l @-@ c @-@ u @-@ b @-@ o .
&quot; koala bears always lose cherries under big overpasses . &quot;
ay , no ! how am i gonna remember all that ? !
i gotcha .
ay , teddy ... teddy , you &apos;re amazing !
thank you for saving me !
let me get in there , boys . excuse me .
boom !
okay !
okay , clearly it &apos;s time to talk .
all right , cam , cam , you &apos;re obviously upset .
but trust me--
there are no lingering feelings between me and teddy .
i don &apos;t care about you and teddy .
i don &apos;t like what &apos;s lingering between him and your family .
what ?
mitchell , look around .
your family is cheating on me with your ex @-@ boyfriend .
cheating--okay , yes . th @-@ there is a bit more contact
between them than i realized , but--
oh , o @-@ oh , yeah . now this is where we make cam
the over @-@ sensitive drama queen .
god forbid we take any action to make things right for me .
well , okay , okay . okay , what do you want me to do ?
would you like me to ask them to break up with teddy ?
is that what you &apos;re asking ?
of course not . i would never ask that .
that would be insane .
well , good .
it would be as insane for me to ask that
as it would be sane for you to offer it .
so that is what you &apos;re asking .
no , that &apos;s what i &apos;m not asking .
but if you decide to do it , i want it to come from you ,
not me ,
because i &apos;m clearly not asking for it .
okay , this is nuts .
is it ?
i worked my fingers to the bone
to get these jumpy protestants to love me ,
and now i find out they &apos;re holding a torch
for the man who came before me ?
it &apos;s not nuts . it &apos;s actually quite painful .
excuse me , sir ? you just won a prize
for setting a rink record on the boxing machine .
if you wouldn &apos;t mind taking a picture
for our wall of fame ?
oh , yeah , sure . absolutely . just one second .
that &apos;s exciting .
mitchell , i know you &apos;ll do what &apos;s right .
unless you like seeing me humiliated .
thank you .
everybody was staring , phil .
well , what if we practice outside where no one can see us ?
ay , and now i have the nervous burps !
oh ... claire .
dad ? wh @-@ what are you doing out here ?
apparently this is the only way we &apos;ll get to talk tonight .
about this job .
hey , guys .
this sounds really important , dad . hang on .
go ahead , mitchell .
okay , so listen . this is coming from me .
no one else . but i need you to do something ,
and i don &apos;t want you to give me any flack .
oh , jeez .
that &apos;s flack . i @-@ i think it &apos;s a little weird
how you all still hang out with teddy so much ...
told you .
and i think it &apos;d be appropriate if maybe you all ,
you know , stopped seeing him .
this is coming from cam , isn &apos;t it ?
no , it &apos;s not .
wait a second .
cam doesn &apos;t think we can love him and teddy at the same time ?
and you just sold cam out like that ?
wait . what is that ?
i &apos;ll tell you what it is . it &apos;s sad .
hey , skaters ! not an emergency ,
but we do have a small fire in the snack bar .
we &apos;d like everyone to calmly file outside . thanks .
okay , everyone , the exit &apos;s over here .
come this way , please .
hey , this way , to the exit .
all right , everybody over here .
come on .
you guys , just do this for me .
but ... he &apos;s all the way over there .
there &apos;s no hurry .
we &apos;re in a wooden box built in 1970 .
let &apos;s go !
oh--all right , let &apos;s go .
okay , thank you . that &apos;s very nice .
sweet of you .
hey , skaters , good news !
fire &apos;s out !
sorry for the scare .
all right--all right , before you get upset ,
this was just about convenience .
was it ?
or was it a perfect metaphor ?
congratulations , mitchell .
this is the saddest i &apos;ve ever been in roller skates .
okay , be careful .
i don &apos;t want to get hurt , okay ?
no one &apos;s gonna get hurt .
hold on !
aah ! that hurts !
okay , if we could just ...
son of a mitchell !
do not worry one bit .
you are gettin &apos; it !
let &apos;s get away from the cars , huh ?
disgusting .
claire pritchett ?
jeff ?
no way !
i haven &apos;t seen you since you worked here .
you ... you still do .
yeah , do what you love ,
you never work a day in your life , right ?
right .
this is perfect .
some civilian just yakked in the rink .
can you take over for a minute ?
um ... no .
ah , it &apos;s kind of where i make most of my money .
you know , i hate to shut it down .
ah , i got a girl pregnant . it &apos;s a whole thing .
all right . i &apos;ll do it for a minute , sure .
great .
thank you . thank you .
okay .
oh , hey ...
yeah ?
i still think about that kiss .
oh , god .
gross .
mom , i threw up .
oh , honey , that was you ? you &apos;re gonna be okay .
let me get you something for your tummy .
i &apos;m just so stressed out .
you know that hero essay i have to write ?
well , dad kind of assumed i wrote it about him ...
but i didn &apos;t .
and now he wants to read it ,
and i don &apos;t know what to do .
don &apos;t worry about your father . i am sure he &apos;ll understand .
claire , i need some ice for cameron .
and we have to talk about the job .
unless you &apos;ve taken back this one .
dad , i &apos;m with a customer right now .
i &apos;ll be with you in just a moment .
honey , i &apos;ll talk to your dad .
you don &apos;t think he &apos;ll be upset i wrote it about you ?
you wrote it about me ?
mom , you know me and homework .
i didn &apos;t give it much thought . what &apos;s a hero ?
someone who &apos;s not afraid of anything ,
and who &apos;s strong-- that &apos;s you .
but dad &apos;s so great , too .
here it comes .
okay . all right .
you just sit down . sit down , sweet pea .
have your drink . you &apos;re gonna be fine .
here goes . um ...
so , dad , the last time we worked together ,
it was tense between us .
what ?
no , it wasn &apos;t .
yes , it was .
you were--you &apos;re really hard on me ,
and you talk down to me .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
right .
and when i confronted you , like i am doing now ,
you were insensitive , like you are being now .
and while i really appreciate the opportunity ,
and i do love you very much ,
i don &apos;t think that working together is a very good idea .
all right , fine .
i &apos;m not gonna lie . i &apos;m very disappointed .
we won !
man , that sucks !
yeah , totally un @-@ masculating .
well , at least you guys look cool when you play .
let &apos;s play again . this never happened .
actually , we need to go hang out with our family for a while .
really ? now ?
yeah , but we &apos;ll be around . we &apos;ll see you guys .
what happened ? did i mess up ?
no , you did great .
so he didn &apos;t like me ?
no , he totally liked you .
then why &apos;d we walk away ?
this was never about him .
this was about getting you some confidence .
guys will pick up on that . better guys .
guys who can lose to a girl
without feeling e @-@ masculated .
okay , try not to throw this in my face one day ,
but sometimes you &apos;re actually really smart .
like , smart smart . i hope you know that .
thanks .
and i &apos;m totally throwing that in your face one day .
are you kidding ?
oh , thank you so much . everything go okay ?
no . actually , i was trapped back here ,
my dad and i got in a whole thing .
now he &apos;s mad at me .
whoa , where &apos;d you find that ?
i know where you keep the beer , jeff .
i hate this feeling !
i swear , it started when i was 12 years old
and i got a &quot; c &quot; in social studies .
the way my dad looked at me , you would have thought
i &apos;d worn a tube top in church .
he knew it crushed me .
he didn &apos;t care .
that &apos;s why i can &apos;t work for him .
he was hard on me then . he &apos;s gonna be hard on me now .
i &apos;m telling you , people don &apos;t change .
i &apos;ve changed .
i don &apos;t wanna put up with this stuff .
i am a completely different person than i was 20 years ago .
all right , kids , that &apos;s gonna be $ 18.50 .
out of $ 20 ?
there &apos;s your $ 1.50 ...
i thought so .
well , i mean ,
do you feel good that you were at least honest with him ?
no . and ... super no .
because i &apos;m the one who &apos;s left with this awful feeling
every time i disappoint him .
it &apos;s not fair .
&apos;cause i &apos;m not the bad guy here .
he needs to know that .
how &apos;s that ?
that better ?
yeah , much better .
thank you , teddy .
you &apos;re fixed . skate with me .
i think it &apos;s a little soon , sweetie .
no . teddy .
but--oh , sure thing , kiddo .
hey , lots of ice , no cartwheels for three days .
yeah .
ready ? come on .
good guy .
who--teddy ? yeah . yeah , he &apos;s the best .
nuts he can &apos;t find anybody , huh ?
gotta be something a little off there .
he definitely did not bring out the best in mitchell ,
i can tell you that right now .
oh , really ?
well , you know , not that it matters ...
but in what way exactly ?
honestly ? when they were together ,
mitchell could be a bit of a pill .
now , i like teddy ,
but when they broke up , i was actually kinda glad .
of course , mitchell thought that i was
uncomfortable because of the gay thing ,
and maybe i was , but ...
i really just wanted him to be happy .
like he is now .
and when you two started up , everyone thought ,
&quot; well , there it is . &quot;
okay , kids . couples skate .
grab someone you love and get out there .
jay , you can be so ...
i &apos;m not skating with you , cam .
yeah .
what about me , dad ? you wanna skate with me ?
what qualifies someone as a hero ?
obviously , a hero has to be someone we respect .
a person we look up to .
a person who is generous of spirit .
who &apos;s willing to grow and learn .
so ... dad ,
if that offer still stands ...
really ? what changed ?
a couple of things .
maybe it &apos;s the person you love most in the world
or the guy who makes the most out of life ,
no matter what anyone thinks .
it &apos;s cool ! no , everybody &apos;s laughing at me !
keep rolling ! this is your chance !
no ! no !
yeah !
phil !
i know !
for me , though ...
go , dad !
the hero in my family is my family ,
because of who we are together .
c @-@ minus .
&quot; this was not the assignment . &quot;
i &apos;ll tell you who is not my hero .
mrs. rita mcnabb .
oh , thank you ! thank you !
what is everybody looking at ?
oh , i guess i can tell the story one more time .
sure , yeah . well , i was mad about something .
i don &apos;t even remember what .
i turned . now at this point ,
i &apos;m more animal than i am man .
strike the punching machine ,
and apparently i broke some sort of world record .
i guess the thing that i &apos;ll never forget
is the sound that it made .
it was , like , bells and whistles and sirens .
it &apos;s impossible to describe .
oh , no !
that was literally the first punch i &apos;ve ever thrown !
you are never to see him again .
yes , i know .
