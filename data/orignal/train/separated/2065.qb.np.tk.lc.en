robert zane made you an offer .
he did .
you begged me for a second chance .
and now he &apos;s using you to destroy us .
you waltzed in here thinking this was gonna be
like some prison movie , but it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s just prison .
welcome to danbury .
mike ross .
frank gallo .
we &apos;re being sued for every case mike ross has ever touched .
you won &apos;t admit this whole thing is your fault
in the first place .
my fault ?
if i hadn &apos;t brought mike in , you &apos;d still be here
sniveling around like a goddamn junior partner .
your fiancé , you want to call her ?
maybe i &apos;ll just send rachel a text .
we need to move the money that we have
in every account by tomorrow .
we don &apos;t need to move it .
we can use their buy @-@ ins to settle the class @-@ action lawsuits .
all right , let &apos;s go .
i &apos;m in the right cell . i &apos;m in the one you gave me .
yeah , but this isn &apos;t the one they gave me .
you said you could &apos;ve turned on a guy to get out of here ,
but you didn &apos;t because you owe him .
well , i owe that son of a bitch too .
you son of a bitch .
take it easy , mike .
and remember , i know about you .
and i got your little girlfriend &apos;s number right here .
you keep watching that clock ,
it &apos;s gonna be a long two years .
believe it or not , i &apos;ve been where you are right now .
you &apos;ve been thinking about how to get back
at that son of a bitch all night .
spit in his oatmeal .
shit on his pillow .
whatever it is , my advice to you is don &apos;t do it .
i don &apos;t need any advice from you .
excuse me ?
you &apos;re the one
that left me alone with that psychopath in the first place .
now i get why you haven &apos;t
said a word to me since last night .
how the hell did you think i &apos;d react
after something like that ?
hey , listen , man .
i don &apos;t have anything against you ,
but i sure as hell don &apos;t have anything for you .
and i &apos;m not gonna cause trouble with a guy like that
for someone i &apos;ve never even met , so if he wants me
to switch for a few hours , i &apos;m switching .
to hell with what happens to me , right ?
hey , i didn &apos;t say that .
no , you just did it .
donna , what are you doing here ?
i come bearing gifts .
that &apos;s really nice , but you don &apos;t have to come over here
to check on me . i &apos;m fine .
says the girl in her fiancé &apos;s shirt .
look , i know it &apos;s cheesy .
rachel , you wanted to feel him next to you .
it &apos;s not cheesy .
thanks , donna .
well , you do owe me a thank you ,
but it &apos;s not for that .
because in a couple of hours it &apos;s going to be more
than his shirt wrapped around you .
are you saying that you got me on the visitor &apos;s list ,
because they said that if i &apos;m not family--
i don &apos;t care what they said . you &apos;re his family .
and you &apos;re my family , and i wasn &apos;t going to sleep last night
until i got you on that list .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know what to say .
say , &quot; thank you , donna , &quot; and get your ass up there .
what you got in your hand there , tiger ?
dark roast , splash of cream , no sugar .
and to what do i owe the honor ?
i was thinking this morning about the day
you picked me out of the mailroom
and how far we &apos;ve come .
you know , it &apos;s funny .
i was thinking this morning about how far we &apos;ve fallen .
then let &apos;s go put these lawsuits to bed .
excuse me , officer ?
i know the phones don &apos;t open until 10 : 00,
but i was wondering if it &apos;s possible for me
to make a phone call ?
get back in line and eat your breakfast .
please . the only reason i &apos;m asking
is &apos; cause it &apos;s an emergency . i just need a little--
what , are you on fire ?
your leg broken ?
&apos;cause it looks to me like you &apos;re trying to call
someone out there about something that happened in here .
you don &apos;t understand , all right , my fiancé is--
no , you don &apos;t understand .
unless there &apos;s a bomb headed for us ,
nothing that happens out there has anything to do
with what happens in here . you got that ?
yeah , got it .
hey , i left in such a hurry last night ,
didn &apos;t get a chance to say good @-@ bye .
well , i &apos;ll say it now .
have a nice life . leave me alone .
don &apos;t you want to see a copy of the pictures
your fiancé sent me last night ?
that &apos;s bullshit . she didn &apos;t send you anything .
you &apos;re right , she didn &apos;t .
she sent &apos; em to you .
i mean , you &apos;re the one who started it all ,
telling her how much you missed her .
how hard do you think it was for me to get her
to send a sexy picture to you after that ?
i think that kids today call it a selfie .
there &apos;s no way she sent you a picture like that .
you &apos;re right , it wasn &apos;t sexy .
but what i did , i photoshopped her face
onto a body that is .
i did such a good job ,
no one in here is ever gonna notice .
yeah . i made copies .
one for each guy in the joint .
usually , a situation like this , i would charge a fortune .
but today , i &apos;m feeling so generous
i &apos;m going to give them away for free .
get off him , gallo !
what ? i didn &apos;t do shit ! he attacked me !
that is bullshit !
i tried to tell you that &apos;s the guy .
i don &apos;t care what you tried to do .
you wanted an emergency , now you got it .
get &apos; em both out of here .
what ?
good morning , ms. pearson , mr. specter ,
can i offer either of you a hot towel ?
miss , would you mind telling me who hired you ?
i think we both know who hired her .
what the hell are you doing ?
i &apos;m making copies .
goddamn it .
we don &apos;t bill you out at 350 an hour to make copies .
now get your ass back to work .
that motion isn &apos;t going to file itself .
louis , what the hell did you do ?
what ? what are you talking about ?
we don &apos;t have the money to hire associates ,
paralegals , and support staff .
i know that .
i &apos;m not an idiot , they &apos;re not support staff .
who the hell are they ?
they &apos;re movie extras .
how much weed did you smoke last night ?
we have a settlement meeting in an hour .
and if these offices are empty when they walk in ,
we are gonna look like shit .
louis , did it occur to you
that we &apos;re using the threat of bankruptcy in that meeting ,
and if these offices are filled ,
it kills that plan ?
everybody drop whatever the hell it is you &apos;re doing
and hand your timecards in to my secretary .
and if they are marked one second late ,
i swear to god ,
you will never be fake associates in this town again .
next .
hi .
inmate &apos;s name ?
mike ross . i &apos;m here for visitation .
it appears mr. ross is not receiving visitors today .
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
i was told that i was on the approved visitors list .
it says visitation has been suspended for two weeks
because of an altercation he had this morning .
no , that can &apos;t be right . he just got here yesterday .
it can be right , and it is right .
well then , i need to see him right away .
and i just told you you can &apos;t do that .
yes , i can . because not only am i his fiancé ,
i &apos;m also his lawyer .
it says here a harvey specter is his lawyer .
and he works at pearson , specter , litt , and so do i.
this card says paralegal .
i don &apos;t care what it says .
you don &apos;t let me in there and something &apos;s wrong with him ,
i will make it my life &apos;s purpose to make your life a living hell .
ma &apos;am , i worked maximum security for ten years ,
so if you think i &apos;m gonna be intimidated by the likes of you ,
you &apos;ve got another thing coming .
you know , usually it takes prisoners a couple of weeks to get their first violation .
you &apos;ve been here less than 24 hours .
that might just be a record .
yeah , i don &apos;t care . i need to make a phone call .
you &apos;re not making anything after what you just did .
i didn &apos;t do anything . he set me up .
i don &apos;t care what he did .
so all that stuff about you helping me become a &quot; better version &quot; of myself ,
that was bullshit ?
no , it wasn &apos;t .
then what exactly did you mean ?
because if you won &apos;t even hear my side of the story ,
then how are you gonna help me ?
all right , what do you mean he set you up ?
i mean , he paid off a guard ,
then he posed as my roommate ,
and the next thing i know , he &apos;s about to hand out pictures of my fiancé
to every inmate in this entire prison .
there &apos;s no evidence of any pictures .
but they were all over the floor .
this is what was all over the floor .
listen to me , there might not be any proof ,
but i am telling you that he paid off a guard
and you need to do something about it .
brother , i don &apos;t have any authority over the guards .
then what exactly am i doing here ?
you are learning how to deal with the bullshit life throws your way
without making your situation worse .
and how the hell am i supposed to do that ?
this isn &apos;t just a tea party .
the purpose of this meeting is to decide if you are worth rehabilitating or not .
and if i am ?
then i get you a job .
and if i &apos;m not ?
then you never see me again .
and the next time you have an incident ,
you will go to solitary confinement for a month .
so i suggest you go back to your cell
and you think long and hard about what you want to accomplish during your time here .
i have to say ,
i &apos;m glad you &apos;ve decided to settle
rather than fight these suits .
well , as you can see , things are a little tight around here ,
so you have us at a disadvantage .
what i have is the fact that you don &apos;t want to be talking
about having hired a fraud in court for the next six months .
no , we don &apos;t , so ...
with all due respect , this isn &apos;t an offer ,
it &apos;s a typo .
and with all due respect , this isn &apos;t a lawsuit ,
it &apos;s a shakedown .
bullshit .
this is a chance for you to wipe the slate clean
with the clients you defrauded .
and $ 10 million is a hell of a goddamn wipe .
it &apos;s ten cents on the dollar .
if you don &apos;t take it , it &apos;s going to be zero cents on the dollar .
what the hell are you talking about ?
this money is from our partner buy @-@ in fund .
it &apos;s the only cash we have .
and once the partners find out that we &apos;re using it to settle ,
they &apos;re gonna come after it .
so you have about an hour
to sign on the dotted line ,
or that money &apos;s gone forever .
so take a look around , arlene ,
&apos;cause once it &apos;s gone , there isn &apos;t any more left .
you knowingly defrauded your own clients .
you made a mockery of the legal system .
and i won &apos;t let you get away with it .
you want to know something , arlene ?
we did something wrong , and now we &apos;re paying for it .
but i &apos;m getting a little sick and tired
of people acting like mike ross screwed them over .
he gave his heart and soul to every client he ever had ,
and if those cases were reopened ,
they would end up exactly in the same place .
so , you can sign that deal or not ,
but i &apos;m not gonna spend another second
dealing with a parasite like you .
donna , where &apos;s harvey ? i need to talk to him .
he &apos;s finishing up a negotiation .
this can &apos;t wait .
why ? what &apos;s going on ?
i got up there and they turned me away .
no , that can &apos;t be . i got you on that list .
that &apos;s not it . they turned me away
because he got into a fight .
what ? with who ?
i don &apos;t know .
all i know is that i went to go and see him ,
they said he got into a fight ,
and then they wouldn &apos;t let me in .
good .
how is that good ?
because if they wouldn &apos;t let you in ,
it means he fought back .
you don &apos;t lose visitation if you just got jumped .
harvey , i don &apos;t care if he fought back or not .
it doesn &apos;t mean that he &apos;s okay .
rachel , listen to me . they have an obligation
to tell you if he &apos;s in the infirmary .
did they tell you he was in the infirmary ?
no .
okay , then this is what i &apos;m gonna do .
i &apos;m gonna call up there and get to the bottom of this ,
but it might take a while , so i need you to be patient .
okay .
donna , cancel my afternoon
and have ray meet me downstairs in five minutes .
i thought you said you weren &apos;t worried about mike .
i only said that so that she wouldn &apos;t worry .
they only take visitation away if you &apos;re the one
who starts the fight ,
which means something goddamn happened down there
and i &apos;m gonna figure out what it is .
gretchen , what can i do for you ?
well , i thought since everyone was gone
maybe i could help myself to the executive kitchen for a change .
for a change ?
i wanted to let you know that i had no idea
those people were leaving or i never would have gone
to that appointment .
i know , gretchen .
i would also like to point out
that since they did leave ,
between me , you , and rachel zane ,
this firm just got a whole lot blacker .
well , as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
that has nothing to do with anything .
gretchen , as long as you &apos;re here--
you want to know if i can handle the reception desk
and louis at the same time .
how did you know i was going to ask you that ?
because that &apos;s what good secretaries do .
sure as shit is .
well , there &apos;s one thing about everybody being gone .
when would the three of us ever find ourselves
in here just shooting the shit ?
and when would you have thought that was a good thing ?
this one is a keeper .
i know .
oh , and for the record ,
i &apos;m black in here .
what are you doing here ?
what do you mean
what am i doing here ? i want to know what &apos;s going on .
what &apos;s going on ? nothing &apos;s going on .
i &apos;m in prison .
nothing &apos;s going on ?
then why do you look like that ?
it is none of your business .
well , i &apos;m making it my business
because rachel came to visit you this morning ,
and they told her you got in a fight .
yeah , well , why don &apos;t you do what you always do
and make up some bullshit and tell her it &apos;s not true ?
because i &apos;m busy trying to survive in here .
why won &apos;t you tell me ?
because you &apos;ll try and handle it for me .
well , maybe i should be handling it for you
because you &apos;re too stupid
not to piss someone off on the first day .
okay , harvey . you want to know what happened ?
it wasn &apos;t me who pissed him off .
it was you .
what are you talking about ?
frank gallo .
holy shit .
what &apos;s he doing in here ?
i don &apos;t know . i was hoping you &apos;d tell me that .
i put him away for racketeering .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
last time i checked , that doesn &apos;t land him in here .
you &apos;re right .
a guy like gallo only lands in here for one reason :
good behavior .
why are you saying that like it &apos;s a good thing ?
because bad behavior can get him out .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m gonna go to the warden .
tell him the whole story .
we &apos;ll get him outta here within the week .
that &apos;s exactly why i did not want to tell you .
look , these guards are corrupt .
you go to the warden , it gets back to gallo ,
he &apos;s gonna come after me twice as hard .
it &apos;s one week instead of two years .
look , we got a chance to get him outta here , i &apos;m gonna take it .
he &apos;s got rachel &apos;s phone number .
that &apos;s all the more reason to do it ...
god damn it , harvey !
you pushed me to beat the shit out of you
so that you &apos;d know i could take care of myself in here ,
now are you gonna let me do that ,
or are you gonna cut my legs out from under me ?
i &apos;ll stay out of it .
i want your word .
i won &apos;t go to the warden .
i was wondering when you &apos;d show up .
don &apos;t act like you don &apos;t remember me , harvey .
we both know why you &apos;re here .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i &apos;m here because i represent the prison .
bullshit .
i pulled a string and you came .
you think it &apos;s a coincidence i &apos;m standing here
while you &apos;re walking out ?
okay , gallo , you got my attention .
you want me to step inside ?
or you want to come out here ?
we both know that &apos;s not possible .
you owe me 13 years .
i &apos;m gonna collect .
i didn &apos;t do anything to you
that that investigator didn &apos;t start and you know it .
well , if his little boyfriend ever shows up in here ,
i &apos;ll be sure to take it up with him .
what do you want , gallo ?
i already have what i want .
which is knowing that every time your phone rings ,
you &apos;re gonna ask yourself is this the call where you find out
that the guy who &apos;s in here for you
is never coming out .
listen to me , you son of a bitch .
you think i can &apos;t hurt you in here ?
i &apos;ll put a goddamn bounty on your head .
i &apos;ll pay &apos; em whatever it takes to break your legs .
and if that doesn &apos;t work ,
i &apos;ll wait till you get out and i &apos;ll kill you myself .
so unless you want that to happen ,
don &apos;t you ever even look at mike ross again .
ring , ring , counselor .
ring , ring .
i knew i &apos;d find you here .
&apos;cause this is where you come
when you think you just beat somebody .
what can i do for you , jack ?
you can tell me you used your own money to settle that lawsuit .
&apos;cause if you didn &apos;t , we &apos;re gonna have a problem .
then i &apos;d say we have a problem .
god damn it . you used the buy @-@ in fund .
yes , we did .
then i guess ...
i &apos;ll see you in court .
you &apos;re suing me personally ?
it &apos;s your name on the door .
jack .
i know corporate structures were never your strong suit ,
so i &apos;m gonna explain something to you .
we may use the word &quot; partnership , &quot;
but this is a llc .
and no judge in the world
is going to let you pierce that corporate veil .
they will once they learn you knowingly hired a fraud .
one has nothing to do with the other .
and if you really did find a judge who would do that ,
then you &apos;d be here with an army of lawyers and a brinks truck
instead of standing alone with a flimsy piece of paper
in your sweaty little hands .
you can talk tough all you want , jessica .
the fact is , i do have an army of lawyers and you don &apos;t .
what are you talking about ?
i took that job with robert zane after all .
and i &apos;m willing to drag this fight out ,
so the choice is yours .
give us our money or go out of business .
can i talk to you for a second ?
about what ?
listen , a man &apos;s cell should be the one place he can feel safe .
i took that away from you , and i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , well , sorry doesn &apos;t do shit for me in here .
i know .
that &apos;s why i want to make it up to you .
are you kidding me ?
that &apos;s exactly what got me in this situation in the first place .
i know that .
but i also know you wanted to call
whoever you wanted to call this morning .
and i &apos;m trying to make it up to you .
yeah , well , this doesn &apos;t do that .
hey , look , i can get in a lot of trouble
for just letting you know i have this .
why don &apos;t you do something else that can get you into trouble ?
what are you talking about ?
tell them that gallo paid the guards to have you switch .
i can &apos;t do that .
yeah , because you &apos;re afraid of him .
you &apos;re damn straight i am .
and on top of that ,
i &apos;d make a permanent enemy of everyone else in here ,
because the worst thing you can be known for , my man ,
is as someone who would do something like that .
which means i get to deal with this all by myself .
it &apos;s all right , you can stay .
it doesn &apos;t matter if he stays or goes ,
i got nothing to say to you .
that &apos;s okay , &apos; cause i got something to say to you .
you want to know what my favorite time of day is in here ?
it &apos;s right now .
got the tv going .
guys are sitting around playing cards , telling jokes .
you almost forget you &apos;re in prison ,
which is why i came over here .
&apos;cause i want to make sure you never forget .
there &apos;s gonna come a time
when this place isn &apos;t filled with people ,
and you and i are alone .
then all those vicious threats
your boy harvey specter made to me today
aren &apos;t gonna save you .
i heard today was a good day for rand , kaldor , zane .
if this is about me hiring jack soloff &apos;s department ,
i didn &apos;t do it to stick it to you .
they were leaving anyway .
maybe .
but if your first move
is to have them come after their partner money ,
then i must have been wrong that we were on good terms .
jessica , i accepted your apology .
i wouldn &apos;t say that makes us on good terms .
but i had nothing to do with him coming after your money .
that &apos;s between you and him .
but you do have the power to stop it .
and i am not in the habit of telling my brand new employees
what they can and can &apos;t do .
well , i need you to do it anyway .
jessica--
robert ...
i need this .
and i know it &apos;s not your style
to tell your partners what to do ,
but if you don &apos;t make it your style ,
i &apos;m dead in the water .
this is harvey specter .
you have a call from danbury federal prison .
do you accept the charges ?
yes .
i do not understand your response .
yes . god damn it .
please respond yes or no .
yes .
hello .
mike , thank god .
thank god what ?
you looked me in the eye
and you said you would stay out of it .
you couldn &apos;t even make it to the parking lot
without threatening gallo ?
mike , listen to me .
no , what , so you can lie to me again ?
or are you gonna tell me you didn &apos;t do that ?
look , i didn &apos;t do it because i didn &apos;t think
you could handle yourself .
i did it because he got under my skin .
i don &apos;t give a shit why you did it .
you swore you wouldn &apos;t .
instead , you &apos;ve made things worse .
harvey , if i can &apos;t even trust you ,
then i do not stand a chance in here .
look , i can &apos;t talk right now .
what do you mean you can &apos;t talk ?
rachel &apos;s in my office looking at me right now
and she &apos;s gonna think something &apos;s wrong in five seconds ,
so unless you &apos;ve changed your mind about me not telling her ,
i gotta go .
harvey , you gotta get the phone from her .
sure , rick , no problem .
harvey , get the phone from her .
8 : 30 sounds great .
first round &apos;s on you .
rachel , good , you &apos;re here .
i was just gonna come see you .
i didn &apos;t hear from you , so i just figured--
he &apos;s good . there was an error in the paperwork .
it &apos;s a different inmate , same last name .
okay . so i can see him tomorrow .
actually , he asked that you give him a little time .
what ?
rachel , prison is a big adjustment .
he &apos;ll be ready in about two weeks .
so then , why do i have about 50 texts from him
saying that he can &apos;t wait to see me ?
what ?
harvey , what &apos;s going on ?
give me the phone .
no .
i said give me the phone .
i &apos;m not giving you anything
until you tell me what &apos;s going on .
those texts aren &apos;t from mike .
then who are they from ?
from a guy i put away when i was an ada .
oh , my god .
rachel , don &apos;t let your imagination run wild .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
you don &apos;t know that
because you &apos;re not in there .
you &apos;re right , i &apos;m not .
then what the hell are you gonna do about it ?
i &apos;m gonna do what i promised mike .
i &apos;m gonna have faith that he can handle it .
i don &apos;t believe it . so you &apos;re not gonna do anything ?
you think i don &apos;t want to bust him outta there right now ?
look , if i try and do something and it doesn &apos;t work ,
it makes it worse for him .
is he violent ?
rachel--
is he violent ?
i made him a promise--
i don &apos;t give a shit .
he &apos;s in there to protect you ,
so you better figure out a way to protect him
because goddamn it , harvey ,
if something happens to him in there
and you didn &apos;t do anything ,
i will never forgive you .
harvey , i know you don &apos;t need me to tell you this ,
but she &apos;s right ,
because if something actually does happen to mike ,
even if she forgives you ,
you &apos;re never gonna forgive yourself .
what do you want , harvey ?
five minutes of your time and that &apos;s all .
five minutes to catch up , or five minutes to ask a favor ?
five minutes to help me protect mike ross .
protect him how ? &apos; cause last time i checked ,
he was in the bosom of the federal penitentiary system .
sean , he &apos;s in there with a guy i put away
and the guy is no joke .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that , harvey .
but what am i supposed to do ?
you &apos;re supposed to move the guy to another prison .
i don &apos;t have the authority to do that and you know that .
you can get the authority .
you &apos;re a federal prosecutor .
then why the hell don &apos;t you go after the prosecutor
that put mike away in the first place ?
&apos;cause she doesn &apos;t owe me , and you do .
you got a lot of balls saying that to me
when the entire time we were working together ,
you knew the kid was a fraud .
that kid helped you take down
charles forstman and eric woodall
and put you on the map .
the map ? bullshit .
i was on the map long before i met either of you .
you &apos;re going to tell me you haven &apos;t shot up the ranks
since that conviction ?
you know , harvey , when you first walked in here ,
for a second i actually thought you were gonna apologize
for lying to me all that time .
i don &apos;t need your forgiveness , sean .
i need your help .
all right , i &apos;ll see what i can do .
but , harvey ,
now you owe me one .
jack ?
i &apos;ve had a long day . what are you doing here ?
you know what i &apos;m doing here .
you went to robert zane and you had him shut us down .
i did what i had to do .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me .
all i wanted was my money back .
well , the sooner you get used to the fact that it &apos;s gone ,
the sooner we can both move on with our lives .
that &apos;s the problem . i can &apos;t move on with my life .
what are you talking about ?
i can &apos;t afford zane &apos;s buy @-@ in .
what ?
how is that possible ?
jessica , listen to me .
you know what i did that hardman found out about ,
but what you don &apos;t know is why i did it .
i needed the money .
and now you want me to give you your money back
out of my own pocket ?
jessica , please .
this is a chance for me to have a new start .
even if i wanted to , i can &apos;t do that .
why not ?
you know why not .
i pay you out of my own pocket .
i &apos;m piercing that corporate veil myself .
and if the partners find out , it will cost me millions .
they won &apos;t find out .
well , i can &apos;t take that chance .
jessica , i need this .
i &apos;m sorry , jack .
i can &apos;t help you .
morning .
what ?
you know what .
do i have something in my teeth ?
no , but you got some bullshit in your brain .
excuse me ?
&quot; black in here . &quot;
please , you &apos;re the whitest woman i ever met .
is that a fact ?
tell me something different .
how about i show you something different ?
is that ...
yep .
you gotta be kidding me .
nope .
what year was that ?
&apos;96 .
how long were you together ?
seven months .
that that , mrs. hater .
before his last album or after ?
who do you think that song was about ?
shit . &quot; black in here . &quot;
she &apos;s black all over .
i &apos;m glad we came to an agreement .
and it &apos;s usually not my habit
to court a dalliance with opposing counsel ,
but i couldn &apos;t help but notice
you don &apos;t have a ring on your finger .
not in a million years , mr. litt .
go back to your own side .
man puts himself out there , the least you can do is ...
regarding the class action against pearson , specter , litt ,
do both parties agree to the terms of the settlement ?
we do , your honor .
we do as well , your honor .
then unless there are any objections ,
i see no reason for this court not to ratify--
i have an objection , your honor .
what ?
and you are ?
his name is a. elliott stemple , your honor ,
and he has no standing in this case .
mr. litt .
i have no standing , your honor .
but i represent rothman insurance ,
a company not included in the class of clients
misrepresented by a firm that knowingly hired a fraud .
there &apos;s not one shred of proof we knowingly did anything .
but there is proof that you employed a fraud ,
which is why you &apos;re settling with ms. rosen
in the first place .
are you in on this ?
are you kidding me ?
all right , mr. stemple . submit your evidence .
the court will rule on it tomorrow .
we may have agreed to ten cents on the dollar ,
but if this goes south ,
we &apos;re coming after you for every penny you &apos;ve got .
you little son of a bitch .
watch it , litt . we &apos;re in a court of law .
i don &apos;t care where we are . jack soloff put you up to this ,
and i know it .
so what ?
so i &apos;m gonna prove it .
and when the judge realizes what you did ,
he &apos;s gonna throw your ass in jail .
really ? huh .
because the way i see it , the judge is gonna certify
that my client is a member of this class because they are one
whether jack tipped me off to them or not .
and when that happens , i kill the deal ,
and your money goes back to
the partners that you took it from .
so , why don &apos;t you march your fat feet
back to the only two lawyers left
at that miserable little firm
and decide just how deep you &apos;re gonna reach
into your own pockets to pay me off .
because as i see it , phew ,
you have about 24 hours until you lose everything .
what do you want now , harvey ?
i wanted to apologize for what happened with gallo .
it was wrong .
shouldn &apos;t have happened , and i &apos;m sorry .
but ?
but i don &apos;t care what i promised you
because i found a way to get him out of here ,
and i &apos;m gonna take it .
i told you , you go to the warden--
i &apos;m not going to the warden . i went to sean cahill .
which means gallo won &apos;t know about it
until they &apos;re putting shackles on him
to take him back to wherever the hell he came from .
what are you not telling me ?
i put him away for racketeering .
but that &apos;s not what he really did .
what are you talking about ?
we had him for conspiracy to commit murder .
and the police let the tape of that bastard admitting
that he did it out of the chain of custody
for 20 minutes .
so you went after him for racketeering instead .
i used every trick i had to put him away
for 15 years for three crimes
that would have added to five years at the most .
and that &apos;s why he hates you so much .
it &apos;s also why i need you to lay low
until i can get him out of here .
oh , i can appreciate that , harvey ,
but i can &apos;t exactly hide in my cell 24 hours a day .
then i suggest you do the complete opposite .
you know , i don &apos;t normally take walk @-@ ins .
sorry .
well , as long as you &apos;re here .
well , i thought about it , and ...
i &apos;d like a job .
and if it &apos;s not too much trouble ,
i &apos;d like it to be in front of as many people as possible .
and why is that ?
it &apos;ll be easier for me to stay out of trouble in a crowd .
good .
because i got you a job in the kitchen .
thank you .
don &apos;t thank me . thank yourself .
if you hadn &apos;t come in to see me ,
i never would have told you about it .
is that true ?
you don &apos;t really take walk @-@ ins ?
nah .
just something to say .
the billing records are right there .
mike was at the meeting .
shit , you &apos;re right . he &apos;s got us .
you know what this means .
i do .
louis , i just got your message .
what &apos;s going on ?
harvey , we got a problem ,
and you &apos;re not going to like it .
elliott stemple showed up in court
with an excluded member of the class .
elliott stemple ? are you kidding me ?
he ambushed me , harvey . the judge was about to ratify
the settlement when he comes out of nowhere .
what was i supposed to do ?
you prove his client isn &apos;t part of the class ,
and you shut this thing down .
i can &apos;t do that because his client is a part of the class .
what ? that &apos;s not possible .
yes , it is .
mike took one meeting with rothman insurance .
jack soloff told stemple about it .
no way .
it &apos;s all right here , harvey .
and if we don &apos;t pay him off tonight ,
he kills that deal tomorrow
and we &apos;re out of business ten minutes later .
bullshit . that &apos;s blackmail .
i &apos;m not giving in to blackmail .
oh , come on , do you think i want to do this ?
he &apos;s got us by the balls , harvey .
if we don &apos;t pay him , what was everything we went through
the other night even for ?
which means right now , we just have to figure out
how much we &apos;re willing to pay .
no , we don &apos;t .
harvey , what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying stemple doesn &apos;t care about you two .
he just wants to get in a room with me and see me bleed .
you are not paying that man out of your pocket .
yes , i am .
harvey , jessica &apos;s right .
no , she &apos;s not .
we all know i got us into this mess .
it &apos;s time for me to get us out of it .
all right , you want him , you got him .
but you &apos;re gonna be tempted to rip that man &apos;s head off ,
and when that happens , you &apos;re not going to do that .
you &apos;re going to pay him .
and then you &apos;re going to throw his sorry ass out of here .
harvey , do you have a minute ?
if it &apos;s quick . someone &apos;s on their way over .
i want to apologize to you about earlier .
you don &apos;t need to do that .
yes , i do .
i know that you &apos;re doing what you feel is best .
i just ...
i didn &apos;t think this was going to be as hard as it is .
for me too .
and for what it &apos;s worth ,
i took your advice .
i &apos;m gonna get that guy out of there .
thank you .
rachel ?
he &apos;s gonna be okay .
aren &apos;t you getting a little long in the tooth
for that hottie i just saw in the hall ?
let &apos;s get to it , stemple , because i &apos;m not in the mood .
how much ?
how much what ?
how much to let me have my firm ?
do you mean to imply that i &apos;m simply here
on a mission to extort you ?
oh , we both know you &apos;re here to get my money
so you can split it with jack soloff .
i resent that you think so little of me .
you saying that &apos;s not why you &apos;re here ?
i &apos;m saying i don &apos;t give a shit
about your money or jack soloff .
i want a piece of you .
get your goddamn hands off that .
harvey , harvey , harvey . relax .
i didn &apos;t come here to put my gentle hands
on your precious balls .
i came here to take something far more valuable .
&apos;cause what i want is that piece of shit duck painting .
what ?
that right there .
i was right .
if that didn &apos;t mean something to you , you would have
jumped right out of your chair and said okay to me .
stemple , listen--
not to mention ,
you &apos;ve had that thing as long as i &apos;ve known you ,
and there &apos;s no way a guy like you has a painting like that
unless it means everything to him .
how much money , stemple ?
because you are not getting that painting .
$ 10 million .
elliott .
15 million .
goddamn it .
20 million . do you want to keep going ?
or have you had enough ? because in ten seconds ,
i am walking out of here with $ 20 million
or that thing in my hands .
or tomorrow morning , i &apos;m putting your firm in the ground .
take the painting .
i know you don &apos;t trust me , but look who &apos;s headed this way .
on top of that , people are leaving .
you should leave , too .
no . that &apos;s what he wants .
he wants me to go somewhere
where those guards don &apos;t have a view of me .
and for all i know , he sent you to help him .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
leave me alone .
hey there , mike .
what you reading ? &quot; outliers &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know what you think is gonna happen here , frank ,
but i &apos;m not gonna let you trick me into leaving this room .
i don &apos;t need to trick you . this room will do just fine .
oh , yeah ? why don &apos;t you tell that
to the two guards sitting behind me ?
you mean the ones who let me into your cell ?
they took a little cigarette break , mike .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
so that &apos;s it ?
you &apos;re gonna let these guys kill me ?
who said anything about killing you ?
we &apos;re just gonna hurt you a little , or a lot .
no , no , no , no , no . what i meant was ,
are you really too much of a pussy to take me on by yourself ?
you think they won &apos;t come at you
just because you called me out ?
oh , no , i think that men respond to leaders .
and if you &apos;re too afraid to take on a guy like me ,
you &apos;re not gonna be a leader for much longer .
okay , tough guy .
you want me one @-@ on @-@ one , you got it .
one little thing : i &apos;m gonna use this
and they &apos;re gonna hold you .
no , no , no !
what &apos;s going on here ?
huh ? what ? nothing .
you have the same story ?
yeah .
yeah , nothing &apos;s going on here .
then why don &apos;t you three get away from him ,
and go to your cells ?
and i don &apos;t want to see you back in here
for the rest of the night .
i just saw stemple walking out of here ...
with a canvas that looks about the same size
as that empty space on your wall .
he won &apos;t be back .
so it &apos;s done ?
it &apos;s done .
harvey ?
i remember you told me that painting
was the one happy memory you had of your mother before--
like i said , jessica ,
i was the one who got us into this mess .
i &apos;m the one who needed to get us out of it .
it &apos;s done .
thank god .
so , you want to go get harvey ?
have a drink and celebrate ?
harvey needs to be alone right now , louis .
how about you and me ?
i would ,
but there &apos;s something i need to take care of .
i understand .
louis , you had the right idea .
the wrong execution .
what do you mean ?
i mean , if we &apos;re going to look like a real firm ,
then starting tomorrow , we need to do something
about subletting these offices .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
can i ask you something ?
sure .
why &apos;d you come back with the guard ?
now gallo knows it was you .
he would have found out it was me anyway .
but i might not have .
i didn &apos;t do it to get you to forgive me .
i did it &apos; cause i never should have
let him in here in the first place .
what ?
i just realized that i don &apos;t even know your name .
kevin .
kevin miller .
mike ross .
thank you , kevin .
lights out , gentlemen .
robert , can i talk to you for a second ?
yeah , what do you need ?
i just found out i &apos;m not going to be able
to buy in as a partner .
what ?
i don &apos;t have the money .
and i was wondering--
i don &apos;t need a 50 @-@ year @-@ old associate , jack .
i know that .
if you could just let me pay it off out of my salary .
you know as well as i do , if i let you do that
i might as well waive to buy in for everyone
please , robert .
why can &apos;t you get a loan for it ?
he can , but it &apos;s gonna be a little complicated .
but it &apos;s gonna be a little complicated .
because i &apos;m actually loaning you this money .
and you &apos;re gonna loan it to him ,
and if nobody ever repays anybody ,
nobody &apos;s gonna give a shit .
why are you doing this , jessica ?
because i &apos;m the one that got you into this mess .
i should be the one to get you out .
thank you .
the truth is , jack ,
the older i get ,
the more i &apos;d rather have friends out there
than enemies .
