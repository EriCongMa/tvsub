lives change in five years .
some families grow ,
while others grow apart .
so i thought i &apos;d bring him back sunday around 6 : 00 or so .
fine .
and we find ways ...
it &apos;s not really a good time .
to ease the pain .
yes , in five years ...
edie , is that really you ?
i have a husband now .
many things change .
you &apos;re required to check in once a month .
it was a condition of your release .
all in all , susan mayer &apos;s boyfriend
knew he had a lot going for him .
he was romantic ...
had a nice smile ...
and was consistently thoughtful .
yes , jackson braddock had many wonderful attributes .
sadly ...
a sense of timing wasn &apos;t one of them .
hello .
hi .
can i help you ?
i guess you could tell susan i &apos;m here .
okay. uh ... who are you ?
oh , i &apos;m mike ... the ex @-@ husband .
i , uh , i take it you &apos;re ...
jackson .
i &apos;m , uh ...
susan &apos;s , uh ...
friend ?
friend. that &apos;s right .
wow. could this be any more awkward ?
well , your robe &apos;s open ... so yeah .
hey , your ex @-@ husband is ...
mike ! uh , what &apos;s going on ?
i was just returning m.j. &apos; s video game .
he left it at my house .
oh. thanks. so i guess you met jackson .
yeah. nice legs .
oh , clearly this is not
how i would &apos;ve wanted the two of you to meet .
he &apos;s--he &apos;s really a nice guy .
yeah , well , just to make sure ,
i &apos;m gonna need to hang with him a little bit , check him out .
oh , i don &apos;t know that that &apos;s necessary .
if he &apos;s sleeping in the same house as my son , i think it is .
oh , well , first off , um , m.j. was at a sleepover last night .
and , in fact , jackson and he haven &apos;t even met ,
so , uh , there &apos;s really no need for you to be hanging ...
or checking .
oh , just ... tell jackson i &apos;ll pick him up here tomorrow night .
hey , hold on .
you don &apos;t get to just decide these things by yourself .
you remember how nice i was about our custody agreement ?
i can haul you back to court tomorrow
if i &apos;m not 100 % satisfied with who you expose my son to .
got it ?
uh , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s so not how i wanted to meet your ex for the first time .
well , when you meet him for the second time ,
you can tell him that .
he &apos;s picking you up here tomorrow night .
what ?
i &apos;ll explain over breakfast .
did you get the paper ?
and that is how jackson braddock
realized he needed better timing ...
who are you ?
and a longer robe .
if there is one thing everyone in suburbia can appreciate
it &apos;s a good neighbor .
you know , the kind that helps with the last bag of groceries ...
or brings over misplaced mail ...
or offers to mow your lawn .
yes , everyone appreciates a good neighbor .
you are so sweet to do this .
i just know how tricky these bulbs can be .
and no one knew this better than dave williams ,
who was determined to be the best neighbor
wisteria lane had ever seen ...
assuming , of course ,
his wife didn &apos;t get in the way .
what &apos;s going on ?
packing our bags .
karen mccluskey insulted me again ,
and i can &apos;t put up with it anymore .
all right , what did she say to you this time ?
nothing. it doesn &apos;t matter. we are moving .
adults don &apos;t pack up and move
because of some good @-@ natured teasing .
she said that my breasts were a triumph of german engineering .
you call that good @-@ natured ?
come on. she &apos;s a cranky old lady .
it &apos;s not just her. it &apos;s all of them
i mean , it &apos;s been five years . i have changed .
but the people on this street don &apos;t care .
to them , i will always be a joke .
i &apos;m sorry you had a bad day .
please don &apos;t use your motivational voice .
i really hate that .
you &apos;re upset and you &apos;re tired .
why don &apos;t you take a nice hot shower ,
and i &apos;ll make us some lunch ?
does that sound good ?
i just never understood it .
we--we could &apos;ve gone and lived in any city in this country .
why did you insist on living here ?
&apos;cause we can be happy here .
you just need to give it some time .
and i promise ,
i &apos;ll personally see to it that people
start treating you with a little more respect .
you didn &apos;t answer my questioion .
didn &apos;t i ?
carlos , we got invited to michelle downing &apos;s party !
i &apos;m gonna have to buy something nice to--aah !
gaby , i &apos;m giving a massage .
i can see that .
i can see a lot of things--
things that can never be unseen .
uh , sorry . i guess the towel must &apos;ve rode up .
carlos ? kitchen. now .
i know you don &apos;t like it when i work down here ,
but he couldn &apos;t get up the stairs .
he &apos;s got a bum hip .
he &apos;s also missing a testicle .
carlos , how much more of this am i supposed to take ?
okay , okay , maybe i could set up my table in the garage .
no ! that &apos;s only part of the problem .
have you checked our bank balance lately ?
gaby , i am not taking the country club job .
why not ? you &apos;d be massaging rich people .
they tip better and they tend to flake less .
yeah , but i like working here .
i get to spend lots of time with you and the kids .
carlos , i don &apos;t need to spend lots of time with you .
and frankly , the kids are on the fence. gaby !
bottom line , i miss our life . i miss shopping .
all i have to look forward to is the
occasional invitation to a fancy party .
and i can &apos;t even afford a dress to go to it .
carlos , please , i am begging you .
fine . i &apos;ll-- i will take the job .
thank you .
sorry .
ah , no .
unh @-@ unh. come on .
i really don &apos;t think mike &apos;s gonna care what shirt i wear .
well , i do .
we need a shirt that says , &quot; i &apos;m a responsible citizen , &quot;
not &quot; my favorite clothing store also sells bongs . &quot;
are you dissing my sense of style ?
absolutely .
put this on .
now ...
let &apos;s talk about acceptable topics of conversation .
you like sports , right ? yeah .
i &apos;m a huge soccer fan .
no , you &apos;re not .
you like football-- american football .
specifically the colts .
okay .
and here are some other things you can talk about--
cars , barbecue , fishing .
how about fire ? mike like talk fire ?
jackson , please take this seriously .
i am . i &apos;m just--i &apos;m not gonna pretend to be somebody i &apos;m not .
if he doesn &apos;t like me , what &apos;s he gonna do ?
he could take me to court ,
and the judge can make me choose between you and my son .
and i &apos;m sorry. you will lose .
peyton manning is the greatest quarterback who ever lived .
thank you .
now go shave. you look like a hobo .
got a sec ?
not really .
so i assume you know about what happened to jimmy conrado .
i guess .
your friend gets busted for dealing drugs at school ,
and all you have to say is , &quot; i guess &quot; ?
he &apos;s not my friend .
what are you talking about ?
you were on the same little league team .
yeah , like a million years ago .
anything else ?
no .
not really .
parker .
can i ask you something , just between us ?
does porter hang out with jimmy conrado ?
i don &apos;t know. i could check out his friends list on silverfizz .
his what on what ?
it &apos;s like myspace .
you have a web page .
it shows your hobbies , your favorite music ,
and you can talk to people .
really ? can anyone talk to him ?
yeah. he just has to invite you .
how would somebody make that happen ?
now it &apos;s just a mock @-@ up ,
but this is what the book is going to look like .
mom , that &apos;s fantastic .
good call on the font .
orson , what do you think ?
well , i think it &apos;s strange to see my wife
billed as &quot; mrs. van de kamp . &quot;
well , you knew what the book was gonna be called .
yes , but it &apos;s different actually seeing it .
i mean , is it too late to go with &quot; mrs. hodge &quot; ?
my company , which i formed when we were separated ,
is called mrs. van de kamp &apos;s catering. it &apos;s how i &apos;m known .
oh , in fairview .
but this book will be national .
i mean , it &apos;s your chance to rebrand yourself .
is there something wrong with &quot; hodge &quot; ?
i think i just heard the milk go bad. i should check .
orson , i adore you , but your name ...
our name-- it has no music .
&quot; van de kamp &quot; trips off the tongue .
&quot; hodge &quot; sounds like the noise a plunger makes .
that &apos;s preposterous .
listen ... van de kamp .
hodge .
also , she &apos;s got a radio interview wednesday ,
and they &apos;re already promoting her as mrs. van de kamp .
see ? the ship has already sailed .
oh , don &apos;t be hurt. it &apos;s my professional name .
in this house , i will always be mrs. hodge .
now ... would it help if mrs. hodge
cooked you your favorite pot roast tonight ?
yes , i guess it would help .
uh , meeting with your publicist ?
oh , right. um , tomorrow for sure , then .
van de kamp. hmm .
hodge .
here you go. oh , thank you .
toby , get off my chair. you know better .
so what &apos;s on your mind ?
it &apos;s edie .
you said something to her yesterday that hurt her feelings .
that thing about her breasts ? come on. that was a joke .
perhaps , but it upset her so much
that she suggested we leave wisteria lane .
i can &apos;t have that , mrs. m .
hey , this is what edie and i do.we tease each other .
i say she &apos;s easier to get into than community college .
she says my face looks like a knee .
it &apos;s fun .
still ... i would consider it a personal favor
if you &apos;d apologize to her .
you know , make her feel accepted and loved .
no .
no ?
if edie wants to change the way we talk to each other ,
she &apos;s gotta ask me personally .
and i think you &apos;ve got a lot of gall
making me feel like i did something wrong
when you don &apos;t even know me .
oh ... i know you ,
better than you think .
oh , really ?
for starters ,
you talk to your cat like it &apos;s a person .
when i knocked on your door , you immediately invited me in .
doesn &apos;t take a genius to see that you &apos;re lonely .
i &apos;m thinking you had people in your life at one time ...
people who cared about you .
but something happened to them .
some probably died. the rest , well ...
they just don &apos;t come around much anymore .
why do you think that is ?
i know you , mrs. mccluskey .
and it seems to me that a woman like you
would like to keep the few friends that she has left .
i think you &apos;d better go .
hey ... thanks for tonight .
and , uh , before i forget , the colts suck .
oh , here &apos;s what sucks-- watching a zero @-@ zero game
with no cheerleaders , soccer boy .
you guys were insulting each other. that &apos;s good , right ?
yeah , we had a blast .
really ? yeah .
in fact , we &apos;re getting together wednesday night at o &apos;brien &apos;s ,
which he claims has the best bacon potato skins in town .
potato skins at o &apos;brien &apos;s ? you &apos;ve made his inner circle !
this is fantastic ! thank you. mmm. mmm .
ah , you can think of a more creative way to thank me than that .
you &apos;ve never done that before .
wait .
you &apos;ve never done that before. why are you doing that now ?
i don &apos;t know. don &apos;t you like it ?
yeah. but how did you know i would like it ?
oh , my god .
mike told you about the ear thing , didn &apos;t he ?
no .
so you just happened to stumble across my secret turn @-@ on
the same night that you and mike became b.f.f.s ?
but aren &apos;t we losing sight of the fact that you like it ?
this is ... i mean , i &apos;m just ...
i have been violated .
oh , honey , come on--
don &apos;t touch me ! or my ears ! my ears are dead to you .
it just slipped out .
we were talking about how girls--
they--they all like different things , right ?
and i @-@ i was talking about this girl in high school ,
how she liked to do it with her shoes on ,
and--and mike talked about the lobe nibble .
he has a name for it ?
that &apos;s it. you and mike are not hanging out anymore .
and this little wednesday
&quot; potato skins and susan sex tips night &quot; ?
i forbid it .
did mike mention he likes having his toes sucked ?
oops ! that just slipped out. hmm .
bree ! what &apos;s up ?
well , um , michelle downing asked me to speak to you .
i don &apos;t know if you heard , but i &apos;m catering her birthday party--
i heard. i can &apos;t wait .
ooh , i was gonna ask you .
should i wear the navy blue chanel or the red sleeveless dress ?
you can &apos;t come .
sorry .
i just had to rip the band @-@ aid off .
what ? she &apos;s disinviting me ?
it &apos;s not personal .
you know how carlos just started at the club ?
well , her guests are all members ,
and she thinks they might find it awkward socializing with ...
staff .
she called us &quot; staff &quot; ?
oh , gaby , it &apos;s just one party. i &apos;ll save you some cake .
no ! it &apos;s not just one party !
it &apos;s the kickoff to the whole social season .
if people see we &apos;re off michelle &apos;s list ,
then we &apos;ll be off everyone &apos;s .
and then it &apos;s gonna be the start of our slow slide
from gowns and galas to flip @-@ flops and keggers !
okay , if carlos working at the club is the problem ,
then tell her he just quit .
oh , hon , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s gonna fly .
he &apos;s already rubbed too many members .
what &apos;s happened to my life ?
we used to have help. now we are the help !
what are you doing ?
i am just ...
talking to porter on silverfizz .
who is saraj from macarthur high school ?
me .
i &apos;m 16 and cute .
i like graphic novels and tokyo police club .
oh , my god .
you--you &apos;re pretending to be somebody else ?
our brooding son has a classmate
who got arrested for selling drugs .
i really think the end justifies the means here .
okay , we &apos;ll address your major ethical breach in a moment .
what did you find out ?
well , the good news is
he really doesn &apos;t hang out with jimmy conrado .
but i am a little worried about anita47,
who told him cherry fruit pops are an aphrodisiac .
okay , great , you know who he hangs around with now .
you got what you came for. time to stop .
you &apos;re probably right. it &apos;s just ...
did you know porter writes poetry ?
serious ?
yeah .
our porter , the kid who communicates with grunts and shrugs ,
writes this ...
beautiful , heart @-@ wrenching poetry .
maybe one day he &apos;ll share it with you
instead of your fantasy alter ego .
until then , shut it off .
okay , okay .
you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re right .
oh , really ?
aw. that &apos;s sweet .
still talking to poetry girl ?
bite me .
dude , she didn &apos;t put up her photo .
5 bucks says she looks like she came out of an egg .
whatever .
toby ?
toby ! where are you ?
toby !
everything all right , mrs. m . ?
it &apos;s toby. i can &apos;t find him .
oh , no. how did he get out ?
the living room window was open ,
which is bizarre because i don &apos;t remember opening it .
can you help me find him ?
have you given any more thought about apologizing to edie ?
she &apos;s still pretty down in the dumps .
i &apos;ve kind of been busy .
of course you have. it &apos;s just that ...
well , since i &apos;m about to help you find your cat ,
it sure would be nice if you could help me out with edie .
doesn &apos;t that seem fair to you ?
i guess .
here .
thank you .
okay. toby !
toby ! come here , boy !
toby !
so they &apos;ll finish with the news , do a quick traffic update ,
and then we &apos;re on the air .
uh , do you need anything ?
no , i &apos;m good. how do i look ?
we &apos;re on the radio .
oh. i &apos;m a little bit nervous .
this is my first national interview .
and i am a huge fan of your cookbooks .
well , i &apos;ve heard good things about you .
i understand you &apos;re catering
michelle downing &apos;s birthday dinner tonight .
oh , you know michelle ? yes , and i &apos;ll be there .
i can &apos;t wait to see what you dish up .
okay , now i &apos;m terrified .
here we go .
good afternoon .
i &apos;m linda flanagan , and this is &quot; gourmet americana . &quot;
if you &apos;ve been to fairview &apos;s best parties ,
then you &apos;ve probably tasted the mouthwatering food
dished up by my first guest ,
bree van de kamp .
now she &apos;s about to publish her first book ,
&quot; mrs. van de kamp &apos;s old @-@ fashioned cooking . &quot;
welcome , bree .
hi , linda .
tell me. why &quot; old @-@ fashioned &quot; ?
well , i think a lot of people miss the way life used to be--
back when women had more time to cook .
it &apos;s always been important to me to have the family gather
around the table every night for hot ,
lovingly prepared meals .
so you &apos;re a traditional kinda gal .
is there a mr. van de kamp ?
no .
uh , mr. van de kamp is deceased .
but in regards to my husband ,
i should make one thing very clear--
his passing had nothing to do with my cooking .
is that my yeats book ? i love his poetry .
yeah. i &apos;m borrowing it for school .
this is the kind of poetry that melts a girl &apos;s heart .
so romantic .
oh ! here &apos;s a great one--
&quot; the lover tells of the rose in his heart . &quot;
my first boyfriend gave me this poem.i was a junior in--
mom , i &apos;m--i &apos;m running late. can i have the book back ?
oh. sorry .
enjoy !
katherine , it is not too late to change tonight &apos;s menu .
if linda flanagan likes my food ,
she might give me a quote for the book jacket .
i have to knock her socks off ,
and i am not betting the farm on haddock .
argue with me all you like .
i just bought 40 pounds of pork , so get your tushie over here .
orson ! did you get my message about linda flanagan ?
yes , i heard .
isn &apos;t it amazing ?
mm. almost as amazing as my on @-@ air death notice .
what ?
&quot; so , bree , do you have a husband ? &quot;
&quot; nope. used to. he croaked . &quot;
she didn &apos;t ask if i had a husband .
she asked if there was a mr. van de kamp ,
and there &apos;s clearly not .
well , there &apos;s a mr. hodge .
would it have killed you to have mentioned me ?
and waste valuable airtime ?
the show was about my cookbook ,
not about my tortured marital history .
that &apos;s not what this is about .
it &apos;s because i went to jail , isn &apos;t it ?
orson , i have 6 hours to prepare a meal for 80 people .
we &apos;re not having this discussion now .
just admit it. you &apos;re ashamed of me .
should i be proud ?
do you want me to go on the radio and boast
that my husband served time for running someone over ?
i went to jail because you told me
it was the only way you &apos;d take me back .
and because it was the right thing to do .
i just didn &apos;t know then that i would be a public figure someday .
but i am. i have a name now .
and luckily for you , it &apos;s not mine .
orson , please don &apos;t be hurt .
i am under so much pressure and so terrified i &apos;ll fail
that i don &apos;t even know what i &apos;m saying half the time .
just let me get through this .
as soon as the plates go out tonight ,
i will come home and cook you that pot roast i promised .
okay ?
okay .
it &apos;s just that ... i--
chives ! how could i forget chives ?
hey , susan , it &apos;s me .
listen , i &apos;m not gonna be able to make dinner tonight .
my college roommate &apos;s in town ,
and this is the only night we can get together .
oh. is his name mike delfino ?
did you room together at liars &apos; college ?
um , i know it &apos;s last @-@ minute , and i &apos;m really sorry ,
but i still wanna see you .
so how about i drop by later ?
call me if that &apos;s a problem .
yeah , you &apos;ll drop by later ...
with potato skins on your breath , you miserable two @-@ timer !
what &apos;s wrong , mom ?
nothing .
just , the answering machine lied to mommy .
oh , crap on things .
crap on what things ?
porter sent me a sex poem .
what ? why ?
he may be in love with me .
why would he be in love with you ?
okay ... remember how you told me
i should stop talking to him online ?
well , of course , i didn &apos;t ,
and i sort of told him i liked his poetry .
you told a teenage boy that you liked his poetry ?
jeez , lynette ! why not just flash him a boob ?
shh ! he &apos;ll hear you .
so what are you gonna do ?
are you gonna tell him the truth now ,
or are you gonna wait until after he kills me
and blinds himself ?
calm down. i &apos;m gonna break it off in an e @-@ mail .
oh , great. just like that ? that &apos;ll kill him .
i know that you have only been on the receiving
end of break @-@ up letters ,
but i &apos;ve actually written a few ,
and i know how to let him down easy .
&quot; dear porter , i really like you ,
but i wanna see other offspring . &quot;
go away .
you know , i &apos;m kinda surprised
we still made michelle &apos;s list this year ,
what with me working at the club .
oh , don &apos;t be silly , carlos. we &apos;re still on everyone &apos;s list .
now let &apos;s go .
okay .
gaby , are we in the banquet hall ?
what &apos;s all the noise ?
oh , it &apos;s just the caterers putting glasses
and silverware on the tables .
they make some racket , huh ?
but the decorations are stunning .
especially that waterfall effect .
gaby ?
bree !
shouldn &apos;t you be in the kitchen ?
don &apos;t move , honey. the press is taking your photo .
what are you doing here ? you were disinvited .
i got it all figured out .
we duck inside , make sure we &apos;re seen by all the right people--
except mrs. downing--
and then after about 20 minutes , we cut out .
well , i know nothing. just keep me out of it .
what is carlos doing ?
where is he ?
where is who ?
like you don &apos;t know-- jackson .
well , he &apos;s not here .
really ? whose is this ?
i ... d--i don &apos;t know. some guy &apos;s .
&quot; i ... i don &apos;t know &quot; ?
well , i hope that &quot; some guy &quot;
doesn &apos;t mind this .
no , susan , really , i wouldn &apos;t ...
lady , what are you doing to my beer ?
we &apos;re not married anymore ,
so i don &apos;t have to protect you .
i am ... so sorry .
miss ?
um ... could you just ...
please take good care of my friend ?
jackson canceled on me .
he said you weren &apos;t comfortable with us hanging out .
he said that ?
and i think i said , &quot; meow . &quot;
i am such a jackass .
so why don &apos;t you want us hanging out ?
well , i was pretty ticked off that
you told jackson about the ear thing .
oh , god. the second i said that ,
i wished i hadn &apos;t. i @-@ i &apos;m really sorry .
apology accepted .
so if i promise to behave , can we still hang out ?
&apos;cause i really think it &apos;d be good for m.j. ,
just seeing that we &apos;re all friends .
i don &apos;t ...
what ?
i &apos;m just not comfortable with
you and jackson getting that close .
okay .
it &apos;s just ...
i don &apos;t want him to see me through your eyes .
how exactly do you think i see you ?
well , those last few months we were together , i ...
the things i said to you , the way i acted ...
i mean , i &apos;m not proud of the person i became .
that was a bad time , susan .
we &apos;re not those people anymore .
and if you could see yourself through my eyes ,
you &apos;d know you got nothing to worry about .
could you please take care of this guy ?
he &apos;s my friend , too .
i am glad to see you .
where you been ?
out , uh , doing some thinking .
and i &apos;ve decided that
i may have gone a little overboard about you and mike
in fact , i think it &apos;s cool if you wanna hang out with my ex .
hey , susie q . !
just shakin &apos; the dew off the lily .
and speaking of ,
that paint job in the guest can is nice. kudos .
what are you doing here ?
well , julie needed me to cosign some insurance stuff for her ,
and i guess i lost track of time
talking to crunchy granola here .
plumber to housepainter in one move , susie ?
don &apos;t get dizzy climbin &apos; that social ladder .
can you leave , please ?
just think ...
if i &apos;d been a roofer , we might still be together. sigh. get out .
see ya around , hacky sack .
so ... any more exes i should know about ?
don &apos;t you just love michelle &apos;s parties ?
oh , they are fun. mm @-@ hmm .
but i enjoy my intimate lunches with michelle even more .
we have intimate lunches. we &apos;re friends .
well , you simply must come to the charity auction
at ted &apos;s gallery next weekend .
really ? we &apos;d love to .
gaby !
well , it &apos;s the caterer !
everything is fabulous .
but would you be a dear and get me some more wine ?
i would be happy to .
i just want to make sure it &apos;s the kind you like .
you &apos;re still here ?
dinner is about to be served. whose seats are you in ?
the bowmans .
i found out mrs. bowman is home with the flu. score !
oh , will you unclench ? it &apos;ll be fine .
that was mr. bowman , wasn &apos;t it ?
yes , and i &apos;m pretty sure
that elderly woman with him was his mother !
what kind of man leaves his sick wife at home
to go party with mommy ? !
you can fix this. just tell them that you &apos;re at the wrong table
and then slip out the side door. right .
yes , sir , he has absolutely no--
that was the matred &apos; , wasn &apos;t it ?
yes , and he appears to be checking the guest list .
which we &apos;re not on .
okay , you can fix this .
just explain you &apos;re going to a different party
here at the club and that you got confused .
mrs. downing never has to know. right .
you need to leave ! out .
that &apos;s mrs. downing. how am i gonna fix this ?
at this point , i would just run off screaming into the night .
thank you. mm @-@ hmm .
get your hands off me .
gaby ! gaby !
poor blind bastard .
i &apos;ll meet him outside .
what ? hi , edie .
i just wanted to say i feel awful about what i said to you .
you know , that crack i made the other day ?
okay .
that &apos;s nice of you .
are you all right ?
actually , no. my cat &apos;s missing .
toby ? mm @-@ hmm .
since when ?
it &apos;s been two days , and he &apos;s never been out this long .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s fine .
yeah. well ...
could you tell dave ...
tell him i apologized ? and , uh , you and i are good , huh ?
i guess i could .
why do you want him--oh , just tell him , please .
i cannot believe you pulled a stunt like that .
what ? i was just trying to salvage
what &apos;s left of our social life .
now just let it go
and start thinking about where we &apos;re gonna move .
this is not a joke , gaby .
i work with these people .
i have to show my face tomorrow. it &apos;s humiliating .
you wanna know what &apos;s humiliating ?
waking up one day and finding out you &apos;re invisible .
now it &apos;s official. i &apos;ve lost everything .
everything ?
first our money , then my figure ,
now the last shreds of our social standing .
we haven &apos;t lost a thing
except the chance to hobnob with a bunch of unhappy snobs .
what do you mean , they &apos;re unhappy ?
they &apos;re rich ! they have jewels and cooks .
they use &quot; winter &quot; as a verb .
i rub them , gaby ,
and there is nothing that a blind masseur doesn &apos;t hear about .
trust me .
they are every bit as miserable as i was
when i was out there chasing that stuff .
we have lost nothing that matters .
we have a home , we have each other ,
we have work that supports us ,
and we have two beautiful little girls that ...
love us more than ice cream .
i &apos;ve never been happier in my life .
are you serious ?
yes ,
and the only thing that would make me happier
is for you to realize how good we &apos;ve got it .
&quot; i have never talked to such a wonderful guy ,
but i should &apos;ve told you i &apos;m already seeing somebody ... &quot;
blah , blah , blah ...
&quot; continue to trust your heart , and your dreams will follow . &quot;
wow , lynette .
best dear john letter ever .
uh ... thanks .
except you might wanna change that part
where you signed it &quot; love , m
what ? no it didnt
yeah , you did ...
right there .
you sent it ? !
oh , my god ! oh , my god !
oh , my god ! oh , my god ! oh , my god !
why didn &apos;t you say something ? ! i did !
you said it was great. way to bury the lead , tom !
tom , don &apos;t you dare !
hey , one of us needs to live to take care of the other one .
oh , god .
mind if i join you ?
okay , i know what i did ...
was unforgivable .
and i am not trying to make excuses , but ...
we used to talk all the time ,
and then one day it just stopped ,
and it killed me .
i felt like i lost you .
and then i was saraj , and i had you back ,
and we were talking again , and you were telling me things .
i wasn &apos;t telling you anything .
i was telling her .
okay .
well , for what it &apos;s worth ,
i loved our conversations ,
and i &apos;m ... going to miss them .
me , too .
orson , you &apos;re still up .
oh , i wish you could &apos;ve been there .
linda flanagan loved my food .
she said i was &quot; god &apos;s gift to the table &quot;
and that i could quote her on the book jacket .
are you all right ?
i &apos;m hungry .
it &apos;s after midnight. haven &apos;t you eaten ?
i was waiting for you .
you said you &apos;d make me pot roast .
i am so sorry. i @-@ i lost all track of time ,
and linda had so many questions about the food .
i &apos;ll make you that pot roast tomorrow , okay ? no .
i want it now .
now ?
you promised .
orson , i &apos;ve been cooking all day .
i ... i &apos;m so tired , i can barely stand up .
you really want me to make you a pot roast now ?
you promised .
toby !
where in the world did you come from , huh ?
yes , everyone appreciates a good neighbor ...
you know , the kind that helps you with the groceries ...
but doesn &apos;t ask , &quot; why is your son so moody ? &quot;
the type that delivers misplaced mail
but doesn &apos;t point out your wife seems discontented ...
the sort that offers to mow your lawn ...
but doesn &apos;t mention your husband seems cold .
but if you &apos;re not sure the man next door
is as nice as he would have you believe ...
now why would you bring me flowers ?
&apos;cause you &apos;ve got a computer ,
and i need to find out some stuff about edie &apos;s husband .
