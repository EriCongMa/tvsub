last spring , i knelt , as i do now ,
and altered both of our lives forever .
and ever since then , i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve been wondering
when i was gonna make this part official .
nicholas miller ,
will you do me the honor of being my best man ?
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re up . i &apos;ve got something important to ask you .
i &apos;m ready .
would you ...
hold on a second . i need coffee .
here &apos;s one .
thanks .
this just all feels so sudden that , uh ...
i don &apos;t know what to say .
just say yes .
well , i want to say yes .
i really do .
but i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just not there .
i think that you are there .
but i think it scares the hell out of you .
i wish that were the case . i just ...
in my heart , i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m your best man .
nick ... i need you to get there .
do you want to be my maid of honor ?
yes ! yes , yes , yes , yes !
blindsided ? ! how the heck you gonna feel blindsided ? !
we &apos;ve been best friends ever since college !
are you snickering ?
za @-@ zam !
was it worth it ?
oh , it was worth it .
would &apos;ve paid double .
all right , get up .
you stupid bastard .
come here . of course i &apos;ll be your best man !
all right !
these rings are the first
of a dozen accessories that are gonna unify the bridal party .
as you can see from my preliminary vision board ,
our wedding will borrow equally from the holy trinity
of liz taylor , jackie o and the power gays .
oh , i &apos;m scared .
you should be .
guys , look at us .
a year ago , we were spinning
around like cows in the movie twister .
now look at us .
you guys are engaged .
you &apos;re a minority owner of the bar .
i &apos;m the maid of honor who &apos;s made of honor .
that joke works better on paper .
yeah , probably .
and this guy ...
... is the cop
who freaking saved a freaking kid &apos;s life .
help !
i &apos;m stuck !
help !
thanks , officer .
call an ambulance .
i feel fine .
for me !
you know , channel 4
is calling me the carport hero .
i just ... i just really hope it sticks .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
this is ... our year .
the chinese zodiac says it &apos;s the year of the monkey .
i say it &apos;s the year of ...
us ...
it &apos;s the year ...
of us ...
it &apos;s the year of us ...
us ...
thanks so much for your help , jess .
cece has zero idea
that you &apos;re flying her mother in
for the engagement party tonight .
she is ... she is alarmingly in the dark .
maybe it &apos;s a cultural thing .
you know , we saw the british coming . india did not .
are you nervous to meet cece &apos;s mom ?
no .
cece said her mom is really excited that her
sexy little bronco has finally met a cowboy that can tame her .
paraphrasing . and i &apos;m really excited
to meet the woman that cece came out of .
not paraphrasing .
i like your confidence .
meeting big mama p is huge .
her approval means everything to cece .
mom ,
this is my new friend , jess .
20 @-@ minute playdate .
secretly , she &apos;s a romantic ,
&apos;cause she used to be a bollywood dancer
and mr. p &apos;s parents
forbid them from marrying .
hot . continue .
when they saw her perform , they were so moved ,
they gave their blessing .
dance can be so powerful sometimes .
ugh , don &apos;t i know it . that &apos;s why i booked
l.a. &apos; s premier bollywood dance troupe ,
mahotmoves gandhi .
mahotmoves gandhi .
she &apos;s gonna love you . i gotcha .
okay . i &apos;m gonna go check on the best man .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s handling whatever task you gave him
just fine .
he &apos;s so bad at everything !
look , he &apos;s just one of those rare heterosexual men
who does not have a knack for wedding planning .
i &apos;ll never understand men like that .
i can &apos;t pick up cece &apos;s mom from the airport !
it &apos;s too much pressure .
you said i only had to do the easy best man stuff .
you &apos;re picking someone up from the airport in a car .
not outer space in a canoe . it is easy , nick .
then why don &apos;t you do it ?
i can &apos;t pick her up .
tonight is one of the most important nights
of my hair &apos;s life , and i need a shampoo .
not a cut . they &apos;ll try and cut it ,
but i won &apos;t let them .
getting a day @-@ of cut would be insane .
unless , of course , julian &apos;s working .
julian won &apos;t be working though .
you keep fireworks in your car ?
what are you , a little chinese boy ?
hey , you guys ! just saying hey !
he &apos;s your carport hero , baby
carport hero , baby
he can take away your pain
stand by you forever
he can take your breath away .
stop treating me like this , okay ?
i &apos;m no different from anyone else .
officer bishop ,
it is an honor to live in your building , sir .
that &apos;s glen , too , man . glen hates everybody .
glen flips off kids .
guys , look , quit it , okay ?
ever since i became the carport hero ,
you &apos;re treating me like i &apos;m special , and i &apos;m not .
it &apos;s me . winnie the bish ! the bish with the wish !
and my wish is to have fun ! which is exactly why
i &apos;m not gonna confiscate the fireworks behind your back .
yeah , you got me , officer bishop .
you can have it .
i also want you to have this jesus wig .
you know , wigs aren &apos;t illegal .
i know .
but i think it would look awesome on you .
so do i.
put it on .
fine .
beautiful !
whoa , winston , you look so handsome .
oh , my god . it looks even better than i thought .
flight 262 from mumbai ,
your luggage is now arriving at baggage claim 2 .
yes ! yes !
take five .
so , i just got a voice mail from my mom ,
&apos;cause she is at the airport .
did you ... did you fly her in for the party ?
yes .
yeah , i did . it was supposed to be a surprise , but ...
are you so happy ? oh , excuse me .
oh , it &apos;s just ... um ...
hey , nick .
hey , jess .
guess who did it . me .
i got cece &apos;s mom . i was even on time .
oh , she &apos;s there . put her on .
really ? you can speak with her ? how ?
what are you talking about ?
no , jess ,
i @-@ i need to talk to you now .
um , okay . i got to go .
jess says hi !
do you prefer the windows down or the ac ?
wow , you look just like cece !
yeah .
it &apos;s amazing , yeah . i own it myself .
white zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only .
what is going on ?
whatever it is , it can &apos;t be that bad .
jess , i haven &apos;t told my mom that i &apos;m getting married .
okay .
okay .
it &apos;s gonna be fine , &apos; cause ...
i &apos;m your maid of honor ,
and i will be there with you tonight
every step of the way .
&apos;cause this is the year of ,
of ... oh !
oh , my god !
oh , jess ! oh ! oh !
i &apos;m fine .
don &apos;t worry about me .
the doctor said i &apos;ll be good as new in no time .
i know i don &apos;t look like somebody
who should be questioning somebody else &apos;s judgment , but ...
maybe you should have told your mom you were getting married .
i know . i &apos;m just so worried that she is not gonna like schmidt .
and then she won &apos;t give us her blessing ...
which would kill me .
oh , she &apos;ll love him when she meets him .
schmidt is not exactly what my mom had imagined for me .
you know , she wanted someone maybe not so ...
... white ?
oh , he is so white .
remember when the power went out ,
and we put him in the window to keep the planes away ?
what is schmidt gonna think when he finds out ?
we are gonna get her blessing ,
or i &apos;m not your maid of h.
those stairs may have broken my body ,
but they did not break my spirit .
and with that , i rise .
honey , you &apos;re not ... you just need to ... yeah , relax . okay .
you definitely can &apos;t go to this party .
i got to go and tell him .
i got to go tell him before she gets there .
i &apos;ll call nick , and i &apos;ll have him stall her .
okay .
i don &apos;t think i can . you have no idea
how anxious this woman is to get to the party .
no , no , no , i told you , we &apos;re not there yet .
you got to stay plugged in .
you &apos;re such a pill .
well , just take her to the mall , get her some soft serve .
be sure to save your receipts .
i &apos;ll reimburse you from the party fund .
got to go .
mrs. parikh , can you keep a secret ?
i &apos;m going to kill this soft serve nonsense .
you know what we &apos;re gonna do ?
we &apos;re gonna play laser tag !
what are you doing ? !
we &apos;re gonna play laser tag !
it &apos;s a fun american game ! it &apos;s a fun game !
groomsmen ! yeah .
ah . love each and every one of you sons of bitches .
now , who are you ?
i &apos;m groomsman number two .
big schmidt , schmidt &apos;s cousin .
i &apos;m robby , groomsman number four .
i am the ex @-@ boyfriend of the bride ,
and a weirdly close friend of the groom .
i &apos;m number five , j. cronkite valley @-@ forge .
cfo of associated strategies , llc .
i &apos;m 62 years of age , was recently widowed ,
and i believe earnestly
that if we can all work together this wedding season ,
we will get more boom @-@ boom than a tnt factory .
yeah !
thank you for your time . thank you for your time .
i have a brief statement from g3,
who could not make it here tonight .
it says , &quot; dear jess , i can &apos;t fly in for every damn party .
&quot; i will see you at ... : the wedding . &quot;

and almost killed a bunch of people-- that was me !
i &apos;m prank sinatra , baby !

because a badger prank got badgers ,
and it &apos;s dangerous as hell !
ms. parikh .
who are you ?
oh . my goodness . of course .
i must be completely unrecognizable to you
from the countless photos you must have seen .
in honor of your visit , i stood
the humble recipient of a professional shampoo .
so you &apos;re the man who &apos;s marrying my daughter ?
sure am .
no wonder she didn &apos;t tell me that she was engaged .
oh , no , then .
i &apos;m assuming she was afraid i would disapprove .
but now that you &apos;ve met me ...
i disapprove .
mm @-@ hmm . strong disapprove .
let &apos;s take a moment to applaud your daughter &apos;s instincts .
no , no , no . look , schmidt . mom .

thanks , glen . sorry to army- crawl into your home like that .
we come from a country of 400 million men .
let &apos;s say half of them are no good .
another half , very ugly .
that &apos;s still 100 million eligible men .
sure , ten percent are gay .
puts us at 90 million men .
ms. parikh , i love cece .
cut it in half again just for fun .
45 million men .
cece , when were you gonna tell her ?
i &apos;m sorry .

our custom hybrid mandap @-@ chuppah ?

you are the worst prankster in the world !
every prank you do turns out either too big ...

did you register me as a sex offender ?
... or too small .
how &apos;d this blueberry get in here ?
i don &apos;t ...
you should have saw your face !
he did not see that coming .
just like no one &apos;s gonna see what &apos;s coming tonight .
nothing should be coming tonight .
i &apos;m sorry , jess .
the fuse has already been lit .
the lion has spotted the gazelle .
the doo @-@ doo is already mid @-@ flight to the fan .
the silly hounds have been released .
i repeat the silly hounds have been released .
what did you d ... you know what , never mind .
just take me to cece and schmidt , please .
i did a prank . i did a ... oh .
i hope the scooter fits in the elevator .

i &apos;m trying to find out where to return you .
you have pepper spray ?
why didn &apos;t you use that on me ?
all right , i &apos;ll talk to you later .
well , cece &apos;s mom hates me .
like jay z , i have 99 problems .
but unlike jay z , i have zero caveats .
i know , and i &apos;m sorry .
okay ? i &apos;m sorry i screwed up my easy job .
and stop being so mean to me ,
or i swear to god i &apos;m gonna fall in love with you !
where you going ? come back .
let me make it up to you .
i know that i said i wanted the easy job .
but screw that .
i &apos;m the best man , schmidty .
i want the hard jobs .
i can handle it .
so what do we got ? what do we need ?
we &apos;re past hard at this point .
we &apos;re well into impossible .
it &apos;s an unfixable situa ...
schmidt , i did not just drive 15 miles on a gout throne
to watch you give up .
especially not ...
* in the year ... of us . *
look at yourself .
look around us .
maybe this isn &apos;t our year .
i have a plan .
and whatever it is , i &apos;m in . i got this guy &apos;s back .
don &apos;t think we actually need ...
i know , but i &apos;m in , is what i &apos;m saying .
whatever it is , i want in .
okay , whatever .
i want in .
schmidt , how important is this to you ?
have i made that clear ?
that i want to be , like , a third .
you can be in .
you &apos;re in .
you &apos;re in .
thanks .
that &apos;s all i wanted her to say .
are you willing to do whatever it takes ?
of course .
i also didn &apos;t love the tone that , like ,
&quot; i &apos;m in , but who cares that i &apos;m in ? &quot;
ladies and gentlemen ,
could i have your attention please ?
hello .
i &apos;m jessica day .
i &apos;m the maid of honor , but when i fell down the stairs ,
i wished i was made of rubber .
this one goes out to the secret romantic in the audience .
just a little reminder that love ...
conquers all .
and without further ado , mahotmoves gandhi .
follow me , follow me .
follow me !
think they &apos;re all really friends ?
you know , i mean , when the dancing day is done ?
that was great .
fantastic .
wonderful .
where &apos;d she go ?
mrs. parikh ? please , wait .
stop . look .
it was my idea .
i thought we could sway you with the power of dance .
you really think a dance is all it takes ?
mom , i know that schmidt is not what you imagined .
or what i imagined .
i never thought i would fall for
the slim @-@ hipped ghost of tom cruise .
none of us did .
quiet , chair .
but i love him .
he makes me so happy , and i &apos;m gonna marry him .
i will not give my blessing .
cece , schmidt ...
oh , god .
crunch .
shoot me .
you have my blessing .
you have my blessing , too .
mine , too .
oh , come on , not @-@ cece &apos;s mom .
that would &apos;ve been awesome .
it was a natural three .
you got to finish .
we &apos;ll get her on board .
i promise .
oh , she &apos;s gonna get hers .
no , no , winston , no .
what did you do ? no pranks .
such bad timing .
hey , mrs. parikh .
check your shoe .
tickle foot !
i put a feather in your shoe !
too small , dude .
way too small .
i &apos;ve revised my vision .
honey , without my mom &apos;s help ,
i don &apos;t think we can afford to parachute the rabbi in .
well , that &apos;s why i &apos;ve pared it down
to only the things that matter .
that &apos;s great .
we can throw a wedding on a budget .
this is our year .
we can do anything .
now , who &apos;s gonna take me to the john ?
not it !
really ?
you &apos;re the only girl here .
i can &apos;t . it hurts my back .
who keeps giving her juice ?
you &apos;re in a senility scooter ; use a diaper !
that &apos;s a good tickle .
easy , willy .
