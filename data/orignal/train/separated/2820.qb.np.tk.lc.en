like when you &apos;re in somebody else &apos;s bowling shoes ?
that &apos;s the one .
so you went to pete &apos;s .
what happened ?
why is this happening to me ?
maybe it &apos;s my wound .

it &apos;s not healed yet ?
it &apos;s oozing !
would you pass the cream ? there &apos;s the cream .
thank you very much .
tomas , this is gonna be hard , but i wanted it to come from me .

i &apos;ve been sleeping with your wife .
you &apos;re the gynecologist ?
i &apos;m trying to have a private conversation .
can i have a napkin ? could you please hand me a napkin ?

and you are no longer my friend !
we are finished ! nada ! no more !
you are a bastard for doing that !

so what were you gonna tell us ?
i have no idea .
the one with the ultimate fighting champion
what was the big news pete wanted to tell you ?
or should i say , &quot; mrs. monica becker &quot; ?
oh , keep your name . don &apos;t take his name .
he didn &apos;t ask me to marry him .
then definitely don &apos;t take his name !
he wanted to tell me he &apos;s going to compete in some ultimate ...
... fighting competition thingy .
pete ?
why ? what is it ?
i don &apos;t know exactly . it &apos;s sort of like wrestling .
but without the costumes .
and it &apos;s not fake . it &apos;s totally brutal .
it &apos;s two guys in the ring and the rules are , &quot; there are no rules &quot; !
l heard you made a great 12 @-@ year @-@ old .
lt was the best year of my life .
you can bite and pull people &apos;s hair and stuff ?
anything goes except eye @-@ gouging and fish @-@ hooking .
what &apos;s fish @-@ hooking ?
what &apos;s fish @-@ hook
thanks . that would have been hard to describe .
what is that taste ?
my hands are totally clean . i just gave the duck a bath .
thanks for the warm welcome .
it &apos;s good to have you guys on my team . i come to play . i hope you do too .
let &apos;s go out there and get them ! and remember :
there is no &quot; i &quot; in &quot; team . &quot;
yes , but there &apos;s two in &quot; martini . &quot; so , everybody , back to my office .
you ! chuckles . what &apos;s your name ?
it &apos;s bing , sir . i &apos;m sorry . i was just ....
no , no . i heard what you said . funny . i like funny .
this team &apos;s about hard work , but it &apos;s also about having fun .
good to have you aboard , bing !
that &apos;s right . ryder .
winona ryder for six .
thank you .
yeah . we have the reservations .
all right , buddy ! way to go !
dude , what are you doing ?
thank you . my boss keeps slapping my butt , and acting like it &apos;s no big deal .
what &apos;d you do about it ?
i didn &apos;t do anything . i didn &apos;t want to be the guy ...
... who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom .
i gotta tell you , i think it &apos;s okay to be that guy .
maybe it &apos;s that jock thing .
you know , how football players pat each other after touchdowns .
you know , i don &apos;t understand guys .
i mean , i would never congratulate monica on a great stew ...
... by , you know , grabbing her boob .
i know . for a really great stew , you &apos;d just ...
... stick your head in between them .
can we please go eat ?
yeah , what are we getting ?
anything but stew .
so from now on , don &apos;t give your boss a chance to get you .
don &apos;t turn your back to him .
or you could teach him a lesson , you know ?
what you do is rub something that smells really bad on your butt , right ?
then , when he goes to smack you , his hand will smell .
now , what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad ?
what if joey was president ?
can i ask you something ?
okay , you can totally say no ...
... but would it be okay with you if i set ross up on a date ?
with who ?
my friend bonnie . she always thought ross was cute ...
... and she asked if i could set it up .
but if that &apos;s not cool ....
which one is bonnie ?
you remember her from my birthday party ?
average height ...
... medium build , bald ....
that &apos;s fine .
really ? -ross and the bald girl ?
absolutely .
great ! okay ! good for you ! all right !
you are iron ! you are steel !
let me ask you , how come when i call your computer support line ...
... i have to wait an hour and a half ?
we &apos;re adding operators all the time . could we concentrate on my training ?
it &apos;s just hard when i know i have e @-@ mail i can &apos;t get .
hi , honey .
on the table . on the table , please .
so listen , my friends were telling me a little bit about ...
... this ultimate fighting thing .
it sounds really dangerous .
i don &apos;t want you to get hurt because i kind of like you .
i don &apos;t want to get hurt either . i &apos;m being smart about this .
see these guys ? they &apos;re the best trainers in the world .
and hoshi here used to be a paid assassin .
a house painter ! he used to be a house painter !
promise me you &apos;ll be careful .
i promise .
are we still on for tonight ? good . because ...
... maybe we could have a little workout of our own .
no boom @-@ boom before big fight !
how about just a boom ?
that was depressing . i just bought a pretzel ...
... from one of the kids from fame .
ready to go to the movies ? oh , this is bonnie !
this is bonnie ?
this is bonnie ? you &apos;re bonnie ?
i can show you an l.d. if you want .
oh , no . you look a lot different than the last time i saw you .
oh , yeah . well , i just started wearing bras again .
oh , that must be it .
have fun tonight .
thanks . you too .
you said she was bald .
she was bald . she &apos;s not now .
how could you not tell me she has hair ?
i don &apos;t know . i hardly ever say that about people .
oh , well this is just perfect !
well , i &apos;m sorry . i thought you said it was okay .
i said it was okay when i thought she was some weird bald chick .
that girl has got hair all over her head !
maybe ross won &apos;t like her personality .
does she have a bad personality ?
oh , no , bonnie &apos;s the best !
bing !
read your computek proposal . real home run .
barely got you that time . get over here !
come on .
oh , yeah ! good one .
that was a good one . ikeep at it , team !
what is with him ?
&quot; with him &quot; ?
you &apos;re his favorite . you &apos;re his guy !
we never get smacked .
that &apos;s not true . he smacked you once .
not on purpose . he ricocheted off you and got me .
i &apos;m telling you , i need some smacks .
i got a kid starting dartmouth .
dartmouth ? who went to dartmouth ? dartmouth sucks !
you go to dartmouth ?
no , sir .
there you go !
god , ross ! what is that ?
the ultimate fighting combo .
i saved 30 cents . plus , i get to keep the cup .
from new york city , new york ...
... appearing in his ultimate fighting championship debut ...
... he &apos;s known for his confrontational business style !
ladies and gentlemen , introducing ...
... pete becker !
i love you , pete !
and his opponent , from huntington beach , california ...
... he &apos;s a 300 @-@ pound streetfighter ...
... tank abbott !
pete ?
pete ?
that guy &apos;s pretty huge .
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ll use his strength and weight against him .
well , then that guy is in serious , serious trouble .
you go get him . let &apos;s go !
here we go , gentlemen .
are you ready ?
are you ready ? then let &apos;s get it on !
it &apos;s me .
monica .
who else would it be ?
earlier , when you were coming to , you called me fran .
can i just tell you how proud i am of you ?
it would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant , &quot; you suck ! &quot;
i thought you were nuts at first ...
... but you did it .
now you can just look back at this with no regrets .
look back ?
you &apos;re not gonna keep going ?
let me ask you a question : am i the ultimate fighting champion ?
well , no . but
i &apos;m not gonna stop until i &apos;m the ultimate fighting champion .
that guy stood on your neck until you passed out .
let me tell you a story .
when i set out to create moss 865 , do you think it happened overnight ?
no . there was moss 1 that burned down my dad &apos;s garage .
there was moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in january .
and 862 others that i learned from .
just like i learned from this fight , never to let a guy stand on my neck .
you didn &apos;t know that already ?
look , i &apos;m gonna get better .
okay ? i promise you .
just get a lot better .
fast .
one other thing .
hoshi thinks you being ringside may have affected my concentration .
that was the problem .
how long until pete &apos;s fight ?
about five minutes .
they &apos;re interviewing his opponent .
apparently , he trains by going to lran and pulling the arms off thieves .
hot dog ?
four , please .
i &apos;m really nervous .
thank you .
so how did it go with bonnie ?
oh , i gotta tell you , i wasn &apos;t expecting to like her at all .
i actually wasn &apos;t expecting to like anyone right now .
but she &apos;s really terrific .
it &apos;s too bad .
no , i &apos;m saying i liked her .
there are other fish in the sea .
i think she &apos;s great , okay ? we &apos;re going out again .
i hear you . are you capable of talking about anything else ?
which one &apos;s my turkey burger ?
the one next to my foot . sorry .
fight &apos;s starting !
we &apos;ll be right in .
so did your boss try to slap you again today ?
nine times .
i had to put on lotion .
but it &apos;ll be okay . tomorrow , i conduct an experiment .
and if all goes as planned , my butt will be smack @-@ free .
fight &apos;s over !
excuse me , doug ?
hey there , sports fan !
bing ! you got those numbers for me ?
no . i didn &apos;t do them .
you forgot ?
no , i just didn &apos;t do them .
instead , i hung out with some friends and had a couple of beers .
so i certainly don &apos;t deserve praise . verbal ...
... or otherwise .
i got tanked myself last night . pretty dicey drive home .
tappan zee bridge never looked smaller .
that &apos;s okay . you &apos;re still my number @-@ one guy ! bing !
doug !
i &apos;m a little bit uncomfortable with the way that you express yourself .
is it the swearing ? is it the constant swearing ?
because i gotta tell you , if it is , you can just kiss my ass !
it &apos;s not about the swearing . it &apos;s more about ...
... the way that you occasionally ...
... concentrate your enthusiasm ...
... on my buttocks .
don &apos;t get me wrong . i appreciate the sentiment .
it &apos;s just that i have a rather sensitive posterior .
and besides , it &apos;s making all the other guys jealous .
well , say no more . you know , it takes guts to bring this up .
bing , you &apos;re okay .
would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant ...
... or inside his shower drain ?
oh , my god .
look . it &apos;s ross and that girl .
look at that ! it &apos;s a line of ants ! they &apos;re working as a team !
right . oh , yeah . it looks like ross is breaking up with her .
i hope he lets her down easy .
look at that ! they are not breaking up ! look at them !
you know what that is ? a second date , that &apos;s what that is .
look , she just put her hand on his thigh .
that &apos;s nothing . she &apos;s very sexually aggressive .
oh , god !
it &apos;s your fault . now he loves her . he &apos;ll marry her . it &apos;s all your fault .
you said it was okay .
you said she was bald !
was ! was , was , was !
we can &apos;t let it happen . we have to do something . we have to break them up .
just go in there and shave her head ! you owe me one bald girl !
okay , first of all , breathe .
second of all , i don &apos;t get it .
aren &apos;t you the one that decided you didn &apos;t want to be with ross ?
well , isn &apos;t he your friend ? don &apos;t you want him to be happy ?
so ?
it &apos;s just , you know , i didn &apos;t expect him to be this happy so soon .
oh , no .
what ?
we killed them all !
it &apos;s not as bad as it looks . it &apos;s a precaution .
i &apos;m not supposed to move my spine .
please tell me you &apos;re stopping now .
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;d fight tonight if they &apos;d let me .
now , see this circle i &apos;m marking off here ?
this is my zone of terror .
you are insane ! you &apos;ve got to give this up !
i can &apos;t until i &apos;m the ultimate fighter .
i will do it .
the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight ...
... me or superman .
not that i could beat superman , but kids are stupid .
just sit down .
please listen to me .
you are terrible at this , okay ? you are the worst ultimate fighter ever .
ever !
i have a torn rotator cuff , a hairline fracture in my right forearm ...
... and a severely bruised adam &apos;s apple , but that really hurt .
well , then , you know what ?
i care about you too much to watch you hurt yourself like this .
so if you have to do this , you &apos;ll have to do it without me .
if you &apos;re asking me to quit ...
... then you &apos;re asking me to be someone i &apos;m not .
i &apos;ve got to do this .
then i &apos;ve gotta go .
bye .
could you leave a note ? i &apos;m on painkillers ...
... and i might not remember this tomorrow .
so , in conclusion , the lines all go up , so i &apos;m happy .
great job , team ! tomorrow at 8 : 30 .
phil , nice job ! stevens , way to go !
goldberg , you maniac !
i love you !
couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
thank you , sir .
oh , excuse me .
i forgot my briefcase , you know , by accident .
of course , you did . forgot something else too , you bastard !
well , what about you ?
you &apos;re not feeling left out , are you ?
no , not at all . that &apos;s ridiculous .
everybody else got one , and you want one too . don &apos;t you ?
yes , i do .
now , get on out of here , you !
pete becker circles the ring .
looks like he &apos;s just trying to feel him out .
bruiser is charging !
run , you crazy , rich freak !
i can &apos;t watch this .
check it out ! pete &apos;s winning !
really ? -no !
bruiser has becker on the canvas and is going for his favorite area !
wait ! if that &apos;s his favorite area , why is he being so mean to it ?
this is ironic .
your last boyfriend , richard , didn &apos;t want to have kids .
