one of the hardest lessons as a doctor
is learning to prioritize .
truck .
cabin .
spoon .
truck .
cabin .
spoon .
very good .
we &apos;re trained to do all we can to save life and limb .
but if cutting off a limb means saving a life ,
we learn to do it without hesitation .
several months ago , i asked you to remember three words .
can you tell me what they were ?
truck .
cabin .
spoon .
the three words i asked you to remember ,
what were they ?
it &apos;s not an easy lesson to learn ,
and it always comes down to one question ...
what are the stakes ?
truck .
cabin ?
and the third word ?
what do we stand to gain or lose ?
at the end of the day , we &apos;re just gamblers
trying not to bet the farm .
spoon .
spoon .
spoon .
excellent .
chief .
you paged ?
how &apos;s it going ?
well , the word &quot; spoon &quot;
has ceased to have any meaning for me ,
but i &apos;m through the first test set .
i have a few more consults today , but what &apos;s up ?
meredith ...
i would like to initiate a clinical trial .
one that would be the next major advancement
in the fight to cure type i diabetes .
and i &apos;d like you to participate .
but i am on derek &apos;s alzheimer &apos;s trial ,
so i don &apos;t think i i can do both .
just listen .
the basis of this trial was something that i found in here .
in my mother &apos;s journals ?
yes .
she was working on islet cell transplantation
when she became ill ,
trying to eliminate the need for anti @-@ rejection meds altogether .
w @-@ with her notes , drugs , and new technology ,
there &apos;s no way we can &apos;t take this the rest of the way down the field .
we ?
well , it &apos;s your mother &apos;s work .
i wouldn &apos;t feel right moving forward
if you weren &apos;t a part of it .
you should look at them both .
just think about it . it &apos;s your decision .
it &apos;s your birthright , meredith .
it &apos;s your mother &apos;s legacy to you .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a kale and apple juice smoothie .
it &apos;s time to think less about your cravings
and more about filling that baby with nutrients ,
which that has .
it also has chunks . i don &apos;t drink chunks .
i want my coffee . mark , tell the woman
i &apos;m allowed to drink one cup of regular coffee .
sure you are .
oh , w @-@ wait , mark .
are you aware that there are studies that link caffeine
with preterm labor , low birth weight , other birth defects ?
that goo looks great .
i say you stick with the goo .
okay , you two can &apos;t just dictate
what i &apos;m allowed to eat and drink .
nobody &apos;s dictating anything .
but you &apos;re pregnant now , so things have to be different .
you &apos;re gonna have to eat better and take it easier at work .
and well , if it helps , we &apos;ll give up caffeine , too .
that helps no one .
well , how about we put it to a vote ?
all in favor of callie drinking coffee , raise your hand .
all in favor of the goo .
goo it is .
it &apos;s horrible .
it &apos;s the opposite of horrible .
alzheimer &apos;s or diabetes ?
if you continue to whine about how you can &apos;t decide
which groundbreaking medical advancement to put your name on ,
i &apos;ll punch you in the ear .
well , my name &apos;s already on one of them ,
according to the chief . i mean ,
diabetes ...
... affects 240 million people worldwide .
and alzheimer &apos;s ...
... is the seventh leading cause of death .
it &apos;s &quot; sophie &apos;s choice . &quot;
it &apos;s &quot; sophie &apos;s choice . &quot;
i &apos;ve never seen that movie .
oh , you should . it &apos;s really funny .
greys , okay . how long has
your father been having abdominal pain ?
abdominal pain ?
it sounds like abdominal pain .
thatcher grey is not an easy man to get information from .
our-- our father &apos;s here in the hospital ?
yeah , i admitted him an hour ago .
you didn &apos;t know he was coming ?
well , what--what--what &apos;s wrong ?
could it be related to the liver transplant ?
of course . he &apos;s rejecting it because it &apos;s my liver .
okay , look , just do me a favor , go take a blood sample ,
and try to get some more information out of him .
i @-@ i need someone who speaks grey .
hey , stranger .
meredith has two groundbreaking clinical trials ,
and i don &apos;t have any .
okay , but you have a husband that loves you .
yeah , so does she .
then ... then i guess you &apos;re screwed .
i thought i knew all the nurses on this floor .
how did i miss you ?
i guess i &apos;m just lucky that way .
i &apos;m alex karev .
neat .
and you are ?
not telling you my name .
any reason why not ?
because , uh , i don &apos;t want to .
okay .
then how about you pass me one of those charts ?
i hear there &apos;s a turnip in the cabbage patch .
a turnip ?
gorked . brain @-@ dead .
dr. robbins and i have a baby
with a hypoplastic left heart .
the transplant coordinator--
suggested the , uh , turnip as a potential donor .
yeah .
well , now you do get to know my name .
i &apos;m dr. lucy fields .
i delivered that gorked baby .
so , uh , thanks for the heads @-@ up .
i &apos;ll talk to the transplant coordinator .
but now you need to leave .
come on . there &apos;s no reason to overreact .
really ?
well , now you &apos;re barred from the nicu .
how &apos;s that for overreacting ?
you can &apos;t do that .
want to find out ?
oh , what do we have here ?
you really don &apos;t want to know .
let me get that for you , dr. torres .
okay , randy shouse , 23 .
multiple injuries after slamming into a brick wall .
h @-@ how did you --
idiot and his idiot buddies built a human slingshot .
i wasn &apos;t supposed to hit the wall .
i was supposed to fly over the house
and la @-@ land in the pool .
but why would you do that ?
so they could film it , put it on the internet ,
and show the world just how stupid they actually are .
dude .
did you get that ?
yeah , buddy . yeah .
but why ?
because it &apos;s hilarious , that &apos;s why .
okay , randy , that must have been some kind of awesome slingshot ,
because it looks like you &apos;ve dislocated both hips .
now i &apos;m gonna need to get some x @-@ rays .
i &apos;m on it !
wow . she &apos;s perky .
mm @-@ hmm . better than stupid with a death wish .
you &apos;re sick enough
that you need to come into the hospital ,
and you don &apos;t even call me ?
the pain comes and goes . i didn &apos;t want to worry --
so you thought that you would just sneak in
and just quietly reject meredith &apos;s liver ,
not even make a fuss ?
just c @-@ calm down , please .
oh , no . i am calm . i am so calm .
i &apos;m like the calmest one .
okay , good .
because there &apos;s something else
that i should have told you .
i go to a aa couple times a week .
yes , that i know .
no , i know you know , but sometimes ,
you have to get up in front of the group
and you say your piece , and then people sometimes
come up to you afterwards and say
that they like what you said ,
and then maybe you go to
coffee with them afterward .
yeah , like a sponsor ?
no , not a sponsor . oh , how do i --
oh , there you are . sorry . i got turned around ,
and then i ended up back in the lobby .
n @-@ no , no .
mm . no , no , no , no . oh .
oh , god . what ?
i &apos;m sorry . are-- are you in pain ?
not a sponsor .
i am so sorry .
this was not the way that i wanted to meet you .
well , i didn &apos;t even know there was a you to meet .
i know . i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . i -- - okay , mr. grey -- oh , hello .
dr. bailey , this is ... danielle .
dani . hi .
yes , dani .
that &apos;s my father &apos;s girlfriend ,
whom i &apos;ve just met just now .
oh , i see .
um , nice to meet you , dani . i just have a few questions ,
and then i will let you get back to all of this .
do you really think i could be rejecting this liver ?
because dani has been amazing
helping me take care of myself .
and i &apos;m constantly taking pills .
his anti @-@ rejection meds . not , like , speed or anything .
&apos;cause that would be inappropriate .
um , when did the pain start ?
12 days ago .
sh @-@ she &apos;s good with details .
any fevers or changes in your urine or stool ?
no fevers .
but there was a ... pain incident ,
uh , last week , thursday .
a @-@ actually , you might not want to hear this part .
i &apos;m a doctor .
all right .
well , we were being intimate ...
oh , no . - and i was on top --
oh , oh , okay .
go on .
dr. avery .
it &apos;s about time i had you on my service .
thank you , dr. sloan .
i gotta say ,
i really think i have the hands for plastics .
oh , forget about your hands .
look at those cheekbones .
sir ?
you &apos;re genetically blessed .
don &apos;t think i haven &apos;t noticed .
and speaking from personal experience , i can say that
that will only help you in plastics .
that face ? better than a hundred billboards , my man .
all right , dr. sloan , i really don &apos;t feel comfortable
being judged or praised based on my looks .
oh , poor mr. green eyes .
let &apos;s not pretend being beautiful &apos;s a burden .
now come on . mrs. johnson &apos;s nose isn &apos;t gonna fix itself .
how about a little sparkle ?
there it is .
hip dislocation , fractures of his femur ,
radius , ribs , and metacarpals .
should we just , uh , go ahead and reduce those hips ?
kepner , i need you to speak differently .
i &apos;m sorry ? - it &apos;s your voice . it &apos;s a little --
just speak differently .
like with an accent or -- - never mind .
you know , how about
you get me a muffin from the cafeteria ?
get me the sugariest kind you can find , and some coffee .
wait . no .
damn it . no coffee .
okay .
no . you know what ? yes .
coffee . please .
great .
crap ! no . n @-@ n @-@ no coffee .
you sure ?
no , no coffee . just ... just -- just go .
okay .
uh , did you still want the muffin ?
yes .
okay , yes , i know that i &apos;m not dr. bailey ,
but he &apos;s my father ,
and i really need his lab results .
sorry , i can &apos;t do it .
okay , well , then maybe i &apos;ll just
let your supervisor know that
i &apos;ve been highly unsatisfied with your service today .
this isn &apos;t the mall . we don &apos;t have comment cards .
well , maybe you should .
hey . you okay ? you need me to talk to him ?
mark , no .
my day has been too messed up to have you in it , too .
son of a bitch .
we know without a doubt
that this heart is a viable option .
how ? how do we know that this is a good match ?
well , babies under a a year haven &apos;t developed
an immune system that will reject the new organ .
it makes matching a lot easier .
but we &apos;re still four weeks away from the due date .
our ob isn &apos;t even in town right now .
i &apos;m covering for dr. napolitano .
i &apos;ve got her blessing
to go ahead and do the c @-@ section today .
today ? t -- that &apos;s really --
colin , time &apos;s an issue here .
we need to inform the transplant board
as soon as possible if you want this heart .
otherwise , it &apos;s gonna go to another family .
whoa . okay . you know what ?
there are a lot of doctors in the room right now .
so why don &apos;t we give the cookes some space ?
you can have one of the nurses page us
when you &apos;ve made a decision .
what &apos;s going on ? why didn &apos;t you page me ?
turnip , karev ?
you tattled on me ?
you &apos;re so off this case .
seriously ? i have said way worse stuff than that .
yeah , not helping .
are you kidding me ? !
avery , you want to give the osteotomies a shot ?
yes , sir .
mallet , please .
you live with lexie grey now , right ?
how &apos;s she doing these days ?
okay , i guess .
okay ? she hasn &apos;t seemed upset ?
she kind of cries sometimes , but she seems okay .
now are you gonna strip the , uh , lateral cartilage here ?
crying seems fine ?
she &apos;s a girl . girls cry .
but you don &apos;t know what she &apos;s been upset about ?
not really any of my business .
what &apos;s next ?
next , i finish up here
while you go find out what &apos;s up with lexie .
sorry ?
she &apos;s upset . you &apos;re gonna find out why .
you want to be on my service , then serve .
use that avery sparkle .
dr. sloan--
i &apos;m gonna do a couple more rhinoplasties this afternoon .
you do me this solid , and i just might be persuaded
to let you take the lead on one .
ok .
oh . what are you doing ?
uh ... i looked it up ,
and those , uh , caffeine studies showed
birth defects in rats ,
and i &apos;m not a rat , so ...
tell her i &apos;m not a rat .
well , let her have--
hey , we took a vote .
yeah , well , i have to fix multiple fractures , arizona .
that &apos;s major surgery . okay ? so that totally changes
the situation , completely .
and mark &apos;s not here , so it &apos;s your vote against mine .
i need caffeine .
okay , you want caffeine that badly , calliope , fine .
you &apos;re a grown @-@ up . you can make your own decisions .
that &apos;s right . so ...
damn it .
damn it !
that is s not fair . you &apos;re not fair . ugh .
for someone who has a history of ambivalence towards motherhood ,
you got the whole guilt thing down cold .
i am entitled to an opinion .
i mean , i &apos;ve been left out of too much
of the conversation already , and i sure as hell
did not choose mark sloan to be the father .
so if i &apos;m gonna do this , then you know what ?
i &apos;m gonna have a voice .
oh , god . that &apos;s good .
holy crap . your mom was smart .
truck .
cabin . spoon .
3 @-@ for @-@ 3 .
crap . this is so good .
is it better than this ?
&apos;cause seriously , mere , you &apos;d have to
have died of alzheimer &apos;s to fail this .
i don &apos;t even know if i &apos;m doing it yet .
you have to . mother @-@ daughter surgeons cure leading killer ?
i mean , i &apos;m still jealous , and i &apos;m doing a heart transplant
on a baby that hasn &apos;t even been born yet .
will you shut up about that ?
you &apos;re the one who needs to keep his mouth shut , cabbage patch .
screw this . i &apos;ve been on this case for a month .
i &apos;m not just gonna sit here .
meredith , you have to come see dad .
oh , does he want more organs ?
he wouldn &apos;t say .
he was too busy loving up on a tattooed 20 year old .
is that upsetting you ?
you wanna talk about it ?
no .
no worries .
i have a surgery to get to .
meredith .
i can &apos;t deal with my dad .
i &apos;m too busy with my mom .
mere , let &apos;s go . i want to see
your dad making out with his tatted @-@ up fiance .
they &apos;re not engaged .
are you sure ?
meredith , please .
fine .
you &apos;re doing great , sarah .
i didn &apos;t hear her cry .
her lungs were junky . we had to intubate .
she deteriorated fast .
i &apos;ll call for an x @-@ ray and an ultrasound .
already ordered it .
well , what &apos;s her ph ? you &apos;ll need an a.b.g.--
karev , we got it .
yeah , dr. robbins , she &apos;s my patient .
not anymore .
you got something for me , avery ?
i do , actually . uh , her dad &apos;s here .
he might be rejecting his liver ,
and he brought his 20 @-@ year @-@ old girlfriend .
yeah , that &apos;ll do it .
lexie &apos;s probably going crazy .
meredith &apos;s no help when it comes to their father .
i &apos;m not gonna be lead surgeon on a rhinoplasty , am i ?
she just needs someone to talk to .
we are not closed . that is not something we do .
peanut butter cups .
what ?
she &apos;s a stress eater .
you get her eating , you get her talking .
she loves peanut butter cups .
that &apos;s&apos;s ridiculous .
tomorrow , i &apos;m doing a series of cleft palate surgeries
for the nightingales foundation pro bono .
that sort of thing might look fantastic
on the resume of someone who &apos;s
in the running for chief resident .
might ?
get some results ,
we &apos;ll talk .
ugh . get in there .
and do what ?
well , make it stop .
there &apos;s no way she &apos;s 20 . she &apos;s gotta be like 26 , 27 .
i &apos;m 27 .
gross .
uh , tiny baby heart time .
careful when you go in there , mer .
you tangle with one hell &apos;s angel ,
you tangle with the whole gang .
you coming ?
i &apos;m not going in there again .
seriously , lexie ?
i can &apos;t .
well , then i &apos;m going back to work .
meredith--
all right . hey , uh , move , please .
i &apos;m gonna page bailey .
this is what happened last time .
all right , dad , is it the same pain ?
where--where does it hurt ?
i &apos;m telling you ,
i have seen this before .
okay , well , i &apos;m sorry .
will you please let him talk ?
he can &apos;t talk .
no , it &apos;s here . ow !
all right , all right . just back up , please .
baby , it &apos;s gonna be okay . okay ? i &apos;m right here .
back up .
i need to do something .
please just tell me what i can do .
okay , back the hell up right now !
all right . all right , dad .
the blood tests indicate that your liver is fine .
is there anything at all that you &apos;ve left out ?
it &apos;s when he pees .
uh , just now and then last thursday ,
we had mexican food , and he drank all this water
because it was spicy ,
and he went to the bathroom as soon as we got home .
i was freaked out when he screamed later during the sex ,
i didn &apos;t even connect it .
uh , all right , all right . good . that helps .
so what--what do you think it could be ?
well that--it could be kidney stones or your prostate .
prostate ? are you saying he could have cancer ? he--
he can &apos;t have cancer .
that &apos;s what happens when your boyfriend &apos;s an old man .
old men get cancer .
lexie , come on .
no , but see , if you were a doctor like we are ,
you &apos;d realize that when we use the word &quot; prostate , &quot;
it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean cancer .
dr. grey--
no , see , freaking out and jumping to conclusions like a little child
isn &apos;t gonna do him any good .
i am scared , okay ?
i am terrified over here , and i &apos;ve got questions .
you &apos;re terrified ? we &apos;re his family .
i am his family , too !
no , you &apos;re not his family ! you &apos;re his midlife crisis !
lexie , lexie . that &apos;s enough . you &apos;re out of line .
no , y--fine .
lexie .
le--
uh , cancer is--is one of a hundred things it could be .
dr. bailey will run some more test just to rule it out .
it &apos;s far more likely there &apos;s another explanation for this .
are you the daughter that gave him the liver ?
i am .
thank you .
say it again for the camera .
no . no , i don &apos;t think i will .
kepner , talk to the camera
so we can get to the o.r.
in my normal voice ?
or y--
randy has multiple fractures .
the most pressing problems are his hip dislocations .
so we are going to reduce them as soon as possible
before they loose blood flow .
reduce ?
uh , pop &apos; em back into place .
oh , man .
hold on . let me , uh , let me get up on this chair
for the wide angle .
we &apos;re not gonna-- we &apos;re not gonna do it here .
he has to be sedated , and we have to fix his femur ,
so we &apos;re just gonna do everything in the o.r.
wait . what if we did the hips here ,
you know , while i &apos;m awake ?
and then i can give the thumbs @-@ up to the camera .
uh , you &apos;re really not grasping how much this will hurt .
well , it &apos;s for the art , dr. torres .
you know what ?
that is a great idea .
dr. hunt , i think that it &apos;s--
dr. torres , it is for the art .
okay .
marcus , hop on that chair . kepner support him .
okay . you guys ready ?
aah ! please stop ! stop !
stop ! turn the camera off ! stop ! oh !
turn the camera off ! marcus , turn the camera off !
that totally cheered me up .
well , art has that effect .
listen ...
i &apos;m sorry about the turnip thing .
i shouldn &apos;t have said it .
doctor to doctor , you overreacted .
that &apos;s my patient . i deserve to be in there .
you deserve it , huh ?
you know , i have a patient , too .
you want to know what happened to my patient ?
look , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s tough--
she had a 40 @-@ hour labor ,
and then the baby was stuck on an angle , wouldn &apos;t drop .
so my patient just had to push ...
and push and push .
and you want to know what you say to a woman
who &apos;s in that kind of pain ?
you say , &quot; one more , jackie .
one more , and you &apos;re gonna see that baby .
one more , and you &apos;re gonna have a beautifuful baby boy .
i know it hurts . i know it does .
but give me one more , jackie ,
and you get a baby . &quot;
that &apos;s how you get a woman to tear her own body apart .
you promise her a baby .
you make a promise ,
and she hurts herself because she trusts you .
and then ...
when the baby comes out and he &apos;s not , uh ...
he &apos;s not ...
you &apos;re the one that &apos;s gotta tell her
that you were ... mistaken .
makes me kind of lose interest
in what you deserve ...
mr. where &apos;s the cabbage patch .
oh , hey , dad &apos;s got a kidney stone .
dr. bailey &apos;s taking him up to the o.r. now .
oh , she didn &apos;t just give him a strainer ? it &apos;s gotta be huge .
yeah , well , he deserves it .
you know , i never really got it before ,
but this is how he operates .
he starts a new family , stops talking the old ones .
so he &apos;ll go off marrying dani the tatto girl ,
have six little midlife crisis babies ,
and i &apos;ll never hear from him again .
it &apos;s exactly what he did to you .
it is not exactly what he did to me .
of course it is .
lexie , my mother had an affair ,
and then took his kid across the country .
your mother died , and he was miserable ,
and he started drinking , and he destroyed his liver .
this isn &apos;t about you . he found someone who makes him happy .
just give them your blessing . let him be happy .
what are you talking about ? don &apos;t defend him .
you hate him . hate him with me .
lexie , i love you , but you have to grow up .
got a strong heartbeat .
i think she likes her new heart .
of course she does . it &apos;s delightful .
all right . let &apos;s take off the clamp , dr. yang .
why is her blood pressure so low ?
there &apos;s a very low arterial pressure wave .
all right , let &apos;s , uh , let &apos;s check it .
maybe there &apos;s a kink in the arterial line somewhere .
damn it . turn up the flow .
that aorta needs a long diagonal anastomosis .
well , that &apos;ll take at least 45 minutes .
well , we don &apos;t have that .
we &apos;ve gotta do it in 30,
otherwise we &apos;re gonna lose her . scalpel . clamp it .
start the clock .
son of a bitch .
i hate this . i hate this .
come on . come on .
what time do you have , yang ?
27 minutes .
okay . i &apos;m ready .
clamp off .
we got this .
robbins , altman , they got this .
yeah ? then why do you look sick ?
pressure wave &apos;s coming back .
oh . systolic &apos;s 57 .
60 .
64 .
82 .
oh , that &apos;s it . yes .
yes !
yes !
chief , i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m with a patient .
did you get a chance to look over the materials ?
i did . it &apos;s amazing .
well , the next step is getting the funding in place ,
and i can make two phone calls and have that by midweek .
uh , s @-@ so you &apos;re waiting for ...
uh , you .
you have to sign on as co @-@ investigator
so we can start moving forward .
chief , it &apos;s an amazing offer .
it &apos;s not an offer , meredith .
i can &apos;t offer something that doesn &apos;t belong to me .
it was your mother &apos;s work ,
and it &apos;s only right that you continue it .
i , um ... so you think that i owe it to her ?
honestly ?
i think she owes it to you .
she didn &apos;t give you a lot of love ,
but she gave you her talent and her name ...
and this .
this gift could change the course of your career .
i ... have to get back inside .
meredith ...
it might change the way you think about her .
it could be the greatest thing the both of you ever did .
how did it get to this ?
how did four seconds of internet fame
become worth breaking yourself into a million pieces ?
he did it because he thinks it &apos;s funny .
that &apos;s bull . you don &apos;t just put yourself at that kind of risk .
well , it &apos;s his decision .
his decision ?
idiots like this shouldn &apos;t be allowed to make any--
it is his body , okay ? and you dot get to say
what he can and can &apos;t do with it .
he is a person .
he getto make his own damn choices .
i am going through the worst caffeine withdrawal of my life
because someone thinks that being pregnant
means i &apos;m no longer of sound freakin &apos; mind !
you &apos;re pregnant ?
shut up ! i &apos;m not endangering my baby .
i just @-@ i just want one damn cup of coffee !
okay . kepner , go get dr. torres a cup of coffee . okay ?
run .
thank you .
mm @-@ hmm . congratulations .
oh , whatever .
just come around here and help me with his hip .
all right . one ...
two , three .
she doesn &apos;t seem so bad .
candy ?
screw you and your candy .
she &apos;s terrible .
all right .
ever notice how my sister &apos;s a jerk ?
i , um--
yeah , &quot; give them your blessing . &quot; what a bunch of crap .
you know , &quot; let him be happy &quot; ? what about me , you know ?
everybody &apos;s making these huge life decisions ,
and they &apos;re not even considering how it will affect me .
how i &apos;ll feel , you know ?
i &apos;m supposed to be such a big part of their lives ,
and yet they &apos;re leaving me out of the conversation completely .
you know , starting up new families
and springing it on me when it &apos;s already a done deal .
you know , &quot; hey , lexie . guess what .
i found a tatted @-@ up skank to be your new mommy . &quot;
&quot; hey , lexie . i &apos;m gonna have a baby .
you &apos;re just gonna have to be okay with that . &quot;
wait a second . your dad &apos;s having a baby ?
no , not my dad .
mark .
mark is having a baby .
and he didn &apos;t even ask my opinion .
he just clobbered me with it again .
and he &apos;s leaving me behind ...
again .
so we &apos;re done , you know ?
we have to be .
but i miss him .
crap .
my dad &apos;s tatted @-@ up skank isn &apos;t the bitch .
i am .
probably a good start
would be to stop calling her a tatted @-@ up skank .
right .
thanks ...
for listening .
anytime .
i banned him from the nicu this morning .
i kinda want to go in there and kick him out .
yeah , punishing karev is one of my favorite pastimes , too .
he &apos;s harsh sometimes , but he &apos;s also the guy
that gets thrown off a case and then sits in the gallery
and watches an entire surgery just to make sure
his patient &apos;s okay .
i &apos;ll teach him to be less of an ass .
but i don &apos;t have to teach him what to care .
do you even have the authority to ban someone from nicu ?
i don &apos;t know .
just in time , avery . scrub in and take the lead .
that &apos;s okay .
i just came by to tell you that you were wrong .
those , uh , peanut butter cups got me nowhere .
you &apos;re kidding .
guess you overestimated that avery sparkle , huh ?
where you goin &apos; ? scrub in .
really ?
i @-@ i @-@ i assumed , no results , no surgery .
i &apos;m not a total bastard .
you gave it your best shot . scrub in .
okay .
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s okay . take your time .
truck .
cabin .
remember the third word , mom ?
we should &apos;ve come earlier .
she has a harder time in the evenings .
she &apos;s doing fine . we &apos;re just running some tests .
it &apos;s &quot; spoon , &quot; mom .
remember , &quot; spoon &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know why we &apos;re here .
why are we here ?
it &apos;s such a little word .
can we go home now ?
okay , mom .
okay .
he &apos;s gonna be sore for a while .
you &apos;ll need to make sure he drinks plenty of water .
dr. grey .
is he okay ?
he &apos;s fine .
uh , lexie .
will you please just make sure that he calls me ?
yes , of course .
thank you .
i &apos;m almost five years sober .
we support each other ,
and ... i &apos;m good for him .
and he is really ,
really good for me .
is that a hooker on your shoulder ?
i was drunk .
okay .
there he is .
how you feeling , buddy ?
can &apos;t straighten it out any more .
ah , there &apos;s his surgeon .
you &apos;re the man , dr. hunt . how &apos;d he do ?
okay , randy , since there was a tear in your joint capsule ,
we needed to open up the hip to reduce it .
we put a rod and screws into the other femur to fix that
and reduced the other hip .
and this piece of hardware
is keeping your wrist fracture together .
that &apos;s intense .
is that , like , some sort of record or something ?
like the worst case you &apos;ve ever seen ?
um , no . no , no . the worst case i ever saw
was a guy who had an ex fix in his arm like this one ,
but he also had a gaping hole with exposed bone
that needed to be covered .
he also had a matching hole
that , uh , ripped through his back
and tore his stomach apart .
needed 11 surgeries to reconstruct his abdomen .
he survived all that ?
no . no , he didn &apos;t .
but , you know , come to think of it ,
your situation , it is actually worse .
mm @-@ hmm . how ?
well , that guy--he threw himself in front of a grenade
to save six other soldiers .
he didn &apos;t launch himself into a brick wall
so the internet could laugh at him .
turn the camera off , marcus .
chief .
you know , i had forgotten this about your mother .
she wrote everything down .
she didn &apos;t have a thought or a fragment of a thought
that didn &apos;t get scribbled in some journal .
she was compulsive . lucky for you that she did .
lucky for both of us .
no , for you .
you knew the woman who wrote them .
that &apos;s why i gave them to you .
i was happy to read them and to understand her better ,
but the woman i knew was different .
but i am starting to realize how scared she must have been .
that had to be why she was writing everything down .
she must have been so scared .
meredith , i--
so please , go ahead .
i think it &apos;s right that you continue her work .
but i really just want to cure her disease .
good night , chief .
good night .
so ...
what &apos;s your plan ?
sleep .
my plan for tonight is sleep .
i was gonna hit joe &apos;s before heading home .
you wanna come ?
i just need to crash .
yeah . no , i get that .
maybe tomorrow .
for sure . yeah .
sorry about your patient .
thanks . i &apos;m happy for yours .
hey , you want to get a--
no .
right .
we made dinner ... for you .
what is it ?
um , grilled chicken breast
and some brown rice and broccoli ...
and--is that coffee ?
yes , it is .
and here &apos;s the thing--
i get that things are gonna be different now .
and , uh , that &apos;s why i &apos;m gonna eat that chicken
even though the only thing i want right now
is a peanut butter sandwich .
great . i &apos;m really happy--
oh , i &apos;m not done .
if we &apos;re gonna do this whole &quot; everybody gets a vote &quot; thing ,
there &apos;s gonna be a new system .
we &apos;ll still each get one vote ,
but also , the baby gets a vote .
as i house the baby , i &apos;ll be speaking for him / her .
and since i &apos;ll be pushing this baby
out of a very small hole in my body ,
i &apos;ll also get an extra @-@ special vagina vote .
so that &apos;s , uh , three votes for us , two votes for you guys .
oh , we get the final say .
now i &apos;ll be using my many votes to say that once a day ,
i will have one cup of regular coffee , which is perfectly fine
according to the studies that i &apos;ve read ,
at least until i begin breaeast @-@ feeding .
now anybody want to argue with my extra @-@ special vagina vote ? .
no no , thank you .
great .
oh , we also vote that mark gives me a foot rub .
i &apos;ll go get the lotion .
okay , well , i guess that a peanut butter sandwich
is doable if you eat the broccoli .
deal .
surgery is a high @-@ stakes game .
did you decide ?
i did .
i choose you .
i &apos;m glad .
i &apos;ve been going over the data you collected today .
and so far ,
it is 100 % consistent with the pretrial phase .
which means what ?
it means that it &apos;s not not working .
oh . that &apos;s great news .
you wanna know what else is great news ?
what ?
kids won &apos;t be home for another 20 minutes .
and no matter how high the stakes
sooner or later you are just gonna have to go with your nut .
and maybe , just maybe ,
