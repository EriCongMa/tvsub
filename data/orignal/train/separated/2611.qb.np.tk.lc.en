you are samwel zuma ?
i am .
i heard you have a big mouth .
no !
service de chambre .
come !
good morning , mr. batouala .
will you be dining at the table this morning ?
in bed , i think .
very good , sir .
tigers in india have become less abundant
in recent years due to excessive hunting .
救下超过350只鸟类 猿类及猴类
the remaining big cats are now concentrated
in tiny , isolated groups ,
leading to inbreeding ,
which weakens their resistane to disease .
so nostalgic .
the charming and yet tragic naiveté ,
as if these creatures will somehow flourish
if harlan and jack can just manage
to relocate a breeding female .
the mombasa cartel .
poachers ?
not poachers , lizzy -- traffickers .
the poor devils who do the killing
are the smallest of cogs in a very large machine .
and the mombasa cartel is the worst of the lot .
they operate behind an impenetrable veil of secrecy ,
enforced by brute terror
and a rat &apos;s nest of corporate fronts --
subsidiaries of shells inside numbered accounts .
this is going to take some convincing .
the fbi &apos;s job is to protect people .
granted .
let &apos;s forget about the animals for a moment --
the wholesale extinctions , the impact on the environment .
let &apos;s just consider the human toll --
the thorough corruption of local authorities ,
political assassinations ,
the massacres of entire villages
and wildlife compounds --
eradicated for the most base of all possible motives --
profit .
hundreds of billions of dollars a year
in blood money -- human blood money .
this is important to you .
someday the creatures on that program
will be akin to unicorns and griffins --
a fairy @-@ tale bestiary written in past tense ,
and no one is lifting a finger to stop it .
why not , lizzy ?
why not us ?
i &apos;m sorry , this is a controlled class medication .
i can &apos;t refill it without a prescription .
and i told you , you &apos;re --
you &apos;re not refilling it -- you &apos;re replacing it .
the pills were stolen from my car .
you file a police report ?
yeah . yeah . of course i did .
look ... i &apos;ll get in touch with my doctor .
i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll be right back .
next .
over the last few years ,
high @-@ ranking poachers have disappeared without a trace
from the jalloh and yeboah clans ,
the bholas in india ,
and the rocha cartel in bolivia .
now , no one &apos;s taken credit yet ,
but according to reddington , the mombasa cartel
is working to corner the illegal @-@ wildlife trade .
sorry .
four days ago , a dead body washed up
south of petropavlovsk on the kamchatka peninsula --
flayed and skinned with surgical precision ,
according to the local medical examiner .
does the victim have a name ?
joseph batouala --
kenyan , part of the wanjiku cartel ,
the alleged mastermind behind the 2013 elephant massacre
at hwange national park in zimbabwe .
the park &apos;s watering holes were dosed with cyanide ,
killing 300 elephants and thousands of other animals .
and this is the work of our victim ? - victims --
high @-@ ranking officials from half a dozen other cartels
have also disappeared .
according to reddington ,
these gangs are just small fish in a very big pond .
by far , the most destructive is the mombasa cartel .
reddington . i have to take this .
they are ruthless , secretive , and highly organized .
it &apos;s estimated that the mombasa cartel
smuggles about a billion dollars in contraband per year ,
from ivory and hides to the illegal import
of exotic pets to traditional folk remedies .
remedies . for what ?
anything -- from blindness to erectile dysfunction .
for instance , in vietnam , the horn of a rhinoceros
is believed to cure cancer ,
so it commands a price of about $ 9,000 per gram .
where was batouala last seen alive ?
hotel d &apos;argent , paris .
paris .
and yet his body washes ashore on the russian coast ?
do you want to tell reddington , or should i ?
oh , matthew .
that &apos;s the best one yet .
he &apos;s -- he &apos;s beautiful .
i &apos;ve arranged drinks for you with geoff perl .
who will be joining us ? bill gates ? warren buffett ?
no , just you and geoff .
despite being the 33rd richest man on the planet
and the c.e.o. of deckard capital ,
geoff is a passionate advocate for wildlife protection .
he &apos;s also an expert on the illegal @-@ animal trade .
if anyone knows anything about the mombasa cartel ,
it &apos;ll be geoff .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m still getting past the whole
&quot; you &apos;re buddies with geoff perl &quot; thing .
we &apos;re not buddies . i don &apos;t have buddies .
geoff and i simply share a number of interests --
among them , the protection of endangered animals .
i act as a bundler for his charities .
and what does he do in return ?
nothing nefarious , i assure you .
advice , information , the occasional stock tip .
one hand washes the other .
there we go .
queen to b4 . check .
your name is judy trierweiler .
you &apos;re an activist , investigative reporter ,
researching an exposé on the mombasa cartel .
you post under the screen name &quot; elsa . &quot;
and when is this happening ?
tonight at la porte rouge ,
18th street and columbia , 10 : 00 @-@ ish .
dress down .
what is it ?
uh , trierweiler , right ?
judy trierweiler , aka &quot; elsa . &quot;
you all right ?
geoff perl . you must be elsa .
seen your posts . like your style .
a friend tells me
you want some inside dope on the mombasa cartel .
i &apos;ve had a hard time getting a toehold .
welcome to the party .
my foundation &apos;s had the mombasas in our sights
since our inception --
public enemy number one ,
the worst of the worst and very smart .
the crafty bastards at the top keep their hands clean
by financing their wet work
through a hundred shells and offshores .
never been able to crack that firewall .
if you want to give it a try --
got to warn you , though -- it could be very dangerous .
i can handle myself .
i &apos;m sure you can .
i wager you can handle just about anything .
i knew geoff would adore you .
you &apos;re a dead ringer for the last two of his three wives .
oh ? what did his first one look like ?
more like me than you , i &apos;m afraid .
geoff is a savant of sorts --
married into a small fortune , built it into deckard .
sits on the boards of half a dozen tech companies ,
owns a big piece of all of them .
then plows millions into animal @-@ related causes .
what did he have on the mombasas ?
just one access point --
lee chung , emerson @-@ concorde imports .
who are you ? why you do this ?
fbi .
we were wondering if you wouldn &apos;t mind
assisting us in an investigation we &apos;re conducting .
what kind of investigation ?
the kind of investigation where , if you don &apos;t help us out ,
i just yell , &quot; gun ! &quot; and we beat your ass to the curb .
i &apos;m unarmed .
you gonna cooperate ?
please say &quot; no . &quot;
what ?
nothing .
you were late to work again .
you seem a little edgy .
i &apos;m fine . thanks , mom .
chung &apos;s business specializes in the importation
of game meats and animal parts from endangered species .
he &apos;s willing to roll over on everyone else
but claims he doesn &apos;t know anything about the mombasa cartel .
you show him the contraband customs had tagged in his warehouse ?
yeah . and the estimated fees aram worked up .
it &apos;s a lot .
plus 112 charges pending .
and that didn &apos;t rattle him ?
whoa , oh , flag up . looks like we got another one .
pulled up this morning in a fisherman &apos;s net
in hokkaido , japan -- same m.o. -- skinned .
a local m.e. i.d. &apos; d him from the serial numbers
found on an artificial hip -- alejandro gomez , bolivian .
rocha cartel ?
according to bolivian police and wcs ,
rumors are that gomez worked for ...
the mombasa cartel . chung broke .
it turns out our original victim
was not with the wanjiku cartel .
he defected a year ago to the mombasas .
somebody &apos;s poaching the poachers .
tell him what you said .
i said you wouldn &apos;t be alone .
like they care .
she say anything ?
yeah , she &apos;s waiting now .
do you want me to go get her and let her tell you herself ?
thanks for the 24 @-@ hour reprieve .
i met with reddington yesterday .
you told him ?
i started to , but ... no , i didn &apos;t .
that &apos;s too bad . it would &apos;ve been better coming from you .
i hope you understand i don &apos;t have a choice .
neither do i.
freeze ! on the ground !
your father called .
he found another &quot; friend &quot; for matthew .
i just got back .
oh , dear lord . listen to you go on .
i &apos;m the one who does all the abductions .
i &apos;m the one who takes all the risks
while the two of you sit around and --
we &apos;re a family .
everyone does his part .
the poachers your father identifies
deserve what they get .
you should be proud to help him --
and to help your brother , too .
i know it &apos;s hard .
but you know i love you .
peter ... my rock .
hey , mister !
you forgot --
my hat . oh , my gosh .
i can &apos;t believe i forgot it . it &apos;s my favorite .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry . what &apos;s your name ?
zoe .
zoe .
thank you so much , zoe .
oh , no , really . i can &apos;t .
no , no , no . please . i insist .
no , i &apos;m good .
all right , then .
i &apos;m kenneth , by the way -- kenneth rathers .
hello , kenneth .
thank you again , zoe .
i am quite fond of this hat .
let me see .
very snappy , kenneth . later !
taking into account estimated time of death ,
i @-@ i &apos;ve programmed a simulation
illustrating point of origin
by running the tidal and ocean @-@ current data for the dates
our two floaters washed up in japan and russia .
check it out .
the orange one is gomez .
and as you can see ,
both bodies were dumped somewhere
off the coast of sitka , alaska .
sitka was the location of the animal underground network ,
a militant animal @-@ rights group .
&quot; was &quot; ?
yes .
in 1971 , their leader , timothy carlyle ,
along with six others , were tried and convicted
on five counts of homicide
for stalking and killing grizzly poachers
up at katmai national park .
i remember that case .
became a bit of a cause célèbre , as i recall .
yes , the sitka seven .
seven -- why &apos;s it always seven ?
after the bust , the whole thing imploded .
by all accounts , the rest of the group
were more or less hangers @-@ on -- flakes , useful idiots .
go deep on animal underground .
see what became of every member of the group --
arrests , activities , associates --
especially those still in sitka .
what about chung ?
cut him loose .
put a tail on him and see where he leads us .
ressler , get packed .
i want you in sitka
for face @-@ time with anyone samar turns up .
he &apos;s been on the f.b.i. &apos; s ten most wanted list for years ,
but authorities may be finally closing in
on notorious international criminal ,
raymond &quot; red &quot; reddington .
acting on an anonymous tip , police arrested a man
they say is a close associe of reddington &apos;s .
and who may be able to lead them
to the elusive concierge of crime .
was all this really necessary ?
tell you what .
how about i find someone to follow you around 24 @-@ 7
and see how you like it ?
you know as well as i
this has nothing to do with being followed .
this is about being found out .
you &apos;re hiding something .
why else risk my capture ?
ezra &apos;s not gonna talk .
i know that , but you didn &apos;t .
and now you &apos;re holding him in a cement box
under a no @-@ contact order .
congratulations , lizzy .
you &apos;ve plugged the hole , but the dam will fail ,
it &apos;s only a matter of time .
come on , buttercup .
you just know we &apos;re gonna wear this old thing out
if we keep playing it .
how about &quot; wheels on the bus &quot; ?
okay .
peter &apos;s coming tomorrow .
he &apos;s bringing a new friend for you to play with .
isn &apos;t that great ?
look at you , kris kringle !
time to get out now ,
before you shrivel up like a raisin .
my , my .
look at my big boy !
ressler .
chung disappeared this morning .
somebody shot the agent surveilling him
with a tranquilizer dart .
do you think he might have been abducted ?
possibly . we &apos;re not sure . he might have fled .
we flagged his passport .
we &apos;re tracking all international flights .
we &apos;ll keep you posted .
at this point , the closest former animal underground members
that we could find are in anchorage .
any prospects ?
outside of one arrest for possession 15 years ago ,
they look clean .
the ranch .
and make a run out to ... igaluk ranch .
it &apos;s the former location of their commune .
property was picked up at auction
after the big bust by wendigo . llc .
i &apos;ll check it out .
the two vics were skinned antemortem .
presuming sitka is the dumping site ...
they were transported alive .
you think sedated ?
no doubt , but , still , customs , security --
someone would have ...
but , plus , how did they get onto a commercial flight
without proper documentation ?
unless you don &apos;t fly commercial .
homeland security is loathe
to inconvenience the rich and powerful .
pull information on private jets
departing the same days our victims were abducted .
crosscheck tail numbers .
see if you can find a pattern .
private property .
i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t know anyone was here .
well , now you do .
there &apos;s signs posted along the road . you &apos;d best leave .
donald ressler . fbi .
you mind if i ask you some questions ?
what kind of questions ?
about the former owners , the animal underground .
you heard of them ?
yeah , a little . they &apos;re gone now .
been gone a long time .
now it &apos;s just us up here .
us ?
me . my son peter .
anyone else ?
no .
howdy .
you must be peter .
peter kincaid . and you are ?
donald ressler .
he &apos;s with the fbi .
anything you can tell me about the former owners ?
never met them .
a bunch of them went to jail , right ? long time ago .
sorry you came all the way out here for nothing .
that &apos;s okay .
thanks for the cooperation .
yep .
what do you have there ?
goat .
didn &apos;t the people who used to be here
have a bunch of goats ?
lots of people got goats .
you mind if i take a look ?
just watch your fingers . he bites .
paris -- two hours after batouala disappears ,
a chartered citation , cj3s ,
leaves a private airstrip outside the city .
sao paulo -- another citation departs 45 minutes
after alejandro gomez is abducted .
same pilots ?
well , i got two different names here ,
but both check out as bogus , so i &apos;d say yes .
he &apos;s comfortable behind the stick of a citation .
why change horses ?
right .
so i checked local airports and got a third hit .
another citation , which departed yesterday
from westchester at 5 : 12 p.m.
chung .
did they file a flight plan ?
bogus .
all over the map -- tokyo , dubai , paris .
who chartered the planes ?
three separate jets , three separate companies --
one domiciled in oslo ,
uh , the second in belgium ,
uh , the third in south africa .
but they all share a common corporate parent --
or should i say a common corporate
&quot; second uncle cousin sister once removed &quot; ?
what do you know about a company called wendigo , llc ?
wendigo .
what have you found that connects him the cartel ?
not sure . all we know is wendigo controls
chartered jets used in the abductions
and they own a piece of property in the same area
where the bodies were dumped in the ocean -- sitka , alaska .
used to be a commune for a group called animal underground .
ressler went up there to ask some questions .
he &apos;s fallen out of contact .
anchorage division &apos;s scrambling hrt ,
and samar and i are set to rendezvous with them in juneau .
in the meantime ,
if you can dig up any names behind wendigo ...
lizzy , be careful up there .
there &apos;s been a change of plans .
did you call in ?
what is happening ?
is anybody gonna come ?
what the hell is that music ?
no one &apos;s here .
they left us to die .
remember , matty ,
only the animals that are tagged .
happy hunting .
i &apos;ll be at the house with mom .
stop ! stop !
where the hell are you running ? !
where are we ? what do you know ?
nothing . i don &apos;t know anything .
like you , i just ...
how long did it take ?
to get here from the ranch -- how long did it take ?
10 , 15 minutes -- no more .
i passed a gas station on the highway east of here .
if we can get back to it ...
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
i &apos;m fine . nothing .
you looking for your pills ?
they took them . they took everything .
what are you -- a junkie ?
you &apos;re a cop .
i &apos;m not a junkie .
that what all junkies say .
i &apos;ve been trying to reach you for six hours .
you know this is when i meditate .
a man from the fbi showed up asking questions .
peter had to take him out .
what ?
he had no choice . he saw chung .
is he dead ?
well , he will be .
we gave him to matthew .
okay , listen to me .
this time can &apos;t be like the others --
no skinning , no stuffing , no evidence .
tell peter . he &apos;ll know what to do .
matthew won &apos;t like that .
i don &apos;t care if matthew likes it .
i should have tipped off the police
when he began his little hobby .
and have him locked up in some hellhole ?
he wouldn &apos;t have lasted a month , and you know it .
he &apos;s a child .
he &apos;s your child .
i know that .
tell peter to call me when it &apos;s done .
namaste , geoff .
any intelligence on who &apos;s up there ?
two confirmed --
rosemary , a.k.a &quot; skye , &quot; kincaid and her son , peter .
the woman checks out as an associate of animal underground .
yeah , a local girl -- got knocked up
by one of their members , a fella they called &quot; ace . &quot;
her son peter is an expert guide and tracker .
anybody else ?
there could be .
word is , rosie was pregnant again 40 years ago
and insisted on giving birth
up at the ranch -- refused to come in town .
social services paid her a visit about eight months in ,
tried to convince her to change her mind ...
and reported that she was no longer with child .
people have talked -- hunters and whatnot .
and there &apos;s been sightings of somebody or something else .
something ?
the rumor is it &apos;s rosie &apos;s younger son .
fbi . i need to use your phone .
someone &apos;s after me .
what is this ?
there you are -- sean salter .
you went by the name &quot; ace &quot; back then .
you left animal underground
two years before the sitka seven killings
and subsequent trials -- lucky , that .
but , then , you &apos;ve always had a talent for well @-@ timed exits .
well , it seems , ace ,
there &apos;s still some freaks up there living in the woods ,
skinning people and dumping them in the bay .
poachers -- not people ,
responsible for the decimation
of hundreds of wild and endangered species .
yes . horrific .
and if that was your endgame , i &apos;d be writing you
another sizable contribution to keep up the good work .
but that isn &apos;t the endgame , is it , geoff ?
you see , before i got involved with your foundation ,
i ran a comprehensive background check --
all your business interests , corporations --
among them , a rather innocuous shell called &quot; wendigo , llc . &quot;
everything looked fine .
shame on me .
turns out wendigo holds controlling stock
in a small but lucrative concern
called emerson @-@ concorde imports
that you recently identified to a lovely young friend of mine
as a front for the mombasa cartel .
why would i kill my own people ?
you &apos;re a businessman .
as long as you were killing off the competition ,
you took the opportunity to clear out
deadwood in your own operation .
the evidence of your guilt is convoluted but irrefutable .
i simply cannot fathom the journey ,
the moral detours necessary to change a man
who cherished all creatures great and small
into one who profits from their slaughter .
my motives have never been about profits .
i have more money than i &apos;ll ever need .
and there &apos;s been no journey , no detours .
i &apos;m the same guy i &apos;ve always been --
i &apos;m a conservationist .
and as you pointed out , i &apos;m a businessman .
i understand the law of supply and demand .
as long as the market exists -- and it will always exist --
there will be people willing to meet the demand .
it can &apos;t be stopped .
it can be controlled .
a natural monopoly .
exactly .
these cartels are completely out of control .
but through a natural monopoly ,
the supply curve can be managed .
the short @-@ term demand can be met without threatening
the long @-@ term survival of the species .
geoff ...
that was ... breathtaking ...
an operatic perversion of righteous intent .
but your strategy , no matter how noble the rhetoric ,
is betrayed and , inevitably , defined by your actions .
this isn &apos;t about conservation -- it &apos;s about consolidation .
we are what we do , ace .
what do you want ?
a list identifying
every member and operative in the mombasa cartel ,
their business entities , and distribution networks .
or ? - or i shoot you -- here , now .
hey , alejandro .
that &apos;s a real sweet song .
what do you think , joe ?
yeah . me , too .
status ?
male subject downstairs .
female -- upstairs bathroom .
already ?
i wasn &apos;t expecting --
mama .
fbi !
get that window !
freeze !
don &apos;t cry , buttercup .
everything &apos;s gonna be all right .
no !
there it is .
that &apos;s everything -- the whole cartel .
you know , 29 years ago in sierra leone ,
there was a farmer named samwel zuma
who had the audacity to identify
several low @-@ level mombasa operatives to local authorities .
the cartel massacred the entire family --
all but the youngest son .
he was sold to a local ring of flesh peddlers .
the majority of children in those circumstances
don &apos;t last more than nine months .
he survived eight years .
he was 14 when i found him --
too old , too tall , too angry and dangerous
to be of any further value .
he was left to die ,
chained to a standpipe in the basement
of a squalid brothel in nairobi --
branded , burned , barely alive .
so i took him .
made him well , saw to his education .
he graduated university
with a bachelor &apos;s degree in english literature .
he speaks four languages fluently
and can get by in a half a dozen more .
he is ...
splendid .
his name is dembe --
dembe zuma .
raymond ... don &apos;t .
that was then .
it serves no purpose to kill him now .
you see that , geoff ?
that is what a good man does .
that is what separates men like him
from men like you ...
and me .
i &apos;ve been thinking about what to do with you .
to tell you the truth , i haven &apos;t made a decision yet .
the other day was close .
i thought about telling reddington .
he &apos;d know what to do .
but the truth is , this is my responsibility ...
one way or the other .
i &apos;ve answered all your questions .
liz .
you can &apos;t hide me forever .
