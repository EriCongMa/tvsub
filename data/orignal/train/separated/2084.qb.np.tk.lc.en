that them ?

you keep asking me every two seconds .
you okay ?
you seem nervous . you all right ?
i &apos;m not n ... i &apos;m excited , okay ? i &apos;m very excited .
this is the first time
my parents are coming to see me
since i moved here , so i am excited , okay ?
and maybe slightly nervous
for having to spend seven days in a small space
with these two people , okay ?
they &apos;re both very impulsive , excitable , big personalities .
they can lose their temper at the drop of a hat .
ah . so they &apos;re nothing like you .
if you &apos;re gonna be sarcastic , you can wait in the car .
no , i &apos;m just saying the apple didn &apos;t fall far from the tree is all .
well , i didn &apos;t ask for commentary .
fine .
so if you want to be sympathetic ,
a little compassion , i &apos;ll take that ,
but the commentary i don &apos;t need .
hey , six o &apos;clock , big personality .
there &apos;s my boy .
come here .
ma .
look at you .
hey , ma .

thank you . it was very long .
what ? whoa , ma , what &apos;s with all the luggage ?
you know i always overpack .
no , i don &apos;t know that because we never went anywhere .
how would i know ?
you must be steve .
you must be mrs. williams .
aloha .
aloha .
welcome to hawaii .
you can call me clara .
clara . okay .
and mahalo .
i learned that on the plane .
that &apos;s very good . it &apos;s perfect pronunciation .
thanks .
so where &apos;s , uh ... - thank you .
where &apos;s pa , ma ? you , uh ,
stuff him in one of those big bags ?
yeah , about that , he couldn &apos;t make it this trip .
but we &apos;ll talk about that later .
what do you mean he couldn &apos;t make the trip ? what happened ?
is he okay ? what &apos;s going on ?
yeah , yeah , yeah . he &apos;s fine .
okay , so wh ... so why didn &apos;t he come ?
we &apos;ll talk about it later .
ma , just talk about it now . just tell me why he didn &apos;t come .
okay . um ...
i &apos;m leaving your father . we &apos;re getting a divorce .
okay . i &apos;m gonna ... i &apos;m gonna go somewhere else .
hey , you need a hand with those ?
all right .
what do you ... what do you mean a divorce , ma ?
a sports car ? really ?
isn &apos;t that a little obvious ?
i mean , you still have your hair , you know .
would you please focus here , ma ?
this is really not the time or the place .
i disagree . this is the time . what do you ...
what do you mean divor ... you can &apos;t get divorced .
you &apos;ve been married 40 years .
okay , 38 years and this is america .
i can get divorced whenever i want to .
ask kim kardashian .
please don &apos;t do that .
do what ?
don &apos;t try to be funny . this is serious .
please , ma .
i know this is serious .
but i &apos;ve thought about it a lot ,
and it &apos;s the decision that i &apos;ve made .
and i need you to respect that , okay ? come on .
what about here ?
too low .
too high .
a little more to the middle .
more . mo ...
wait . too much . go back .
no , that is too far .
that &apos;s it .
i &apos;m hanging it here .
no , wait , just ...
i really think it should go in the bedroom .
would you relax ?
it &apos;s just drywall .
so , did he lose his license ?
ma , please , just stop .
please . enough .
excuse me . i don &apos;t get it .
if this is your car , then why is he driving it ?
we have an arrangement , you see .
we have what ?
an arran ... no , we don &apos;t have an arrangement .
an arrangement would require my cooperation ,
which we definitely do not have . what we have is me
as a passenger in my car all the time .
he has never been good with sharing .
really ?
that &apos;s not ture .
that &apos;s not true at all . i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m very good at sharing .
but can we get back on topic , please ? now ?
about something that &apos;s important ,
this divorce and how it &apos;s coming out of nowhere .
well , not for me it &apos;s not .
don &apos;t give me a look .
hey , look , it &apos;s fine , okay ? we &apos;re family .
we can discuss this now . we don &apos;t got to wait till later .
yeah , he &apos;s also very impatient .
have you noticed that part ?
he wants what he wants and he wants it right now .
well , i wonder where i get that from .
oh , and now the mumbling starts .
he mumbles under his breath .
have you noticed that ?
it used to drive his teachers crazy and his sisters , too .
mumble , mumble . oh , speaking of which ,
i do not want you calling them about this , do you hear me ?
i &apos;m gonna tell them in person .
you do that because i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s gonna happen :
you &apos;re gonna tell them ,
and they &apos;re gonna lose their mind .
they &apos;re gonna freak out .
oh . wow.as opposed to what you &apos;re doing , right ?
i &apos;m not freaking out ,
if that &apos;s what you mean , okay ?
this is a completely legitimate response
to some very upsetting news .
you know , you &apos;re very dramatic , honey . really .
nice house .
hey , chin , hey . we catch ... we catch a case or what ?
great . no , great .
send me the address . i &apos;ll be right there .
all right , good .
i got to go.uh ... got to get to a crime scene .
lucky you .
well , it was very nice to meet you .
i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll see you again , right ?
i hope so .
oh , hey , have fun .
commander mcgarrett .
yeah .
sean hutton .
honolulu register .
we met at the governor &apos;s christmas party last year .
oh , sure , i remember . how you doing ?
good , good .
hey , listen , i can &apos;t give you a statement .
i haven &apos;t even seen the crime scene .
no , i &apos;m not here to talk about that .
i want to talk about lou grover .
what about him ?
well , i &apos;m doing a story on our new swat captain .
i wanted to see if you &apos;d go on record about him .
ah . okay , well , listen , we just started working together ,
so there &apos;s , uh , not much i can tell you , okay ?
right .
did you know he left chicago under a cloud ?
what kind of story are you writing ?
there was an incident , a hostage situation .
and from what i hear , grover screwed up
and the chicago pd buried it .
okay , well , i don &apos;t know anything about that .
yeah , i &apos;m sure you don &apos;t . &apos; cause if you did ,
you would &apos;ve told the chief of police
and then grover never would &apos;ve been hired .
yeah , maybe .
but if you &apos;re gonna go down that road , mr. hutton ,
you better make damn sure your facts are straight
or you could ruin a good man &apos;s career .
with all due respect , commander ,
i don &apos;t need you to tell me how to write a story .
okay ? and i &apos;m gonna write this story
whether you cooperate or not .
then we got nothing more to talk about .
here we go .
i &apos;ve got the rest of your body right here .
based on the facial features and bone structure ,
it appears to be an adult male .
however , an accurate age estimate is gonna be difficult to make .
any idea how long he &apos;s been in there ?
the state of mummification leads me to conclude
that the range is somewhere between five to seven months .
five to seven months .
how long have the sakatas lived here ?
they just moved in last week .
oh , i think i found our cause of death .
take a look .
a single gsw to the head .
that &apos;ll do it every time .
all right , i &apos;ve seen enough , max .
let &apos;s get him out of there .
as you wish .
who am i ?
someone who &apos;s about to get shot ?
leatherface .
oh , man . you guys are no fun at all .
easy .
guy ingram .
i recognize this guy .
well , this might be why .
kahu realty .
oh , yeah .
his face was plastered on bus benches all over the island , right ?
&quot; when you &apos;re ready to buy , call guy .
i &apos;ll be there to welcome you home &quot;
in this case , literally .
fingerprints confirm our victim is indeed guy ingram .
44 years old , single .
he moved here two years ago from the mainland .
his relatives in cleveland have been notified .
the bullet that killed him was a .22 caliber round shot
in close proximity .
i already sent it to ballistics .
all right , so ,
what else do we know about mr. ingram ?
well , i was able to determine
that the t.o.d. was six months ago .
more precisely , august 7 .
wow , you have an exact date .
that &apos;s very impressive , max .
well , i can &apos;t take full credit for that assessment .
after thoroughly going through the victim &apos;s garments ,
i was able to discover that he was in possession
of an airline ticket ,
which you can see was issued for a flight on august 7 .
right . looks like he was headed to los angeles .
i &apos;m thinking the murder prevented him from making that flight .
pop , it &apos;s me . again .
okay , please , when you get this message
or any of the other 19 messages i left you ,
please call me back .
look , whatever &apos;s going on with mom ,
it is fixable .
so call me and , uh , we will work it out , okay ?
okay . call me . bye .
* i saw the sign *
* and it opened up my mind *
* and i am happy now living without you *
* i &apos;ve left you , oh , oh , oh *
* i saw the sign *
* and it opened up my mind and i ... *
hello , sweetheart .
hi , ma .
i love your house .
oh , thank you . i think this one , uh , is a keeper .
what are you , uh ... what are you doing ?
i &apos;m making you lunch .
oh , good . i &apos;m starving . you doing the , uh ,
macaroni and ketchup sauce ?
yeah .
they serve that in prison , you know .
you loved this when you were a kid .
i know -- i was fond of eating crayons , too ,
but i gave that up .
oh , your ...
ah , ah . i got it .
i &apos;m gonna cook .
really ?
we &apos;ll make a nice ten @-@ minute sauce .
bing , bing ,
and bing . there we go .
you have some very impressive knife skills there , honey .
thank you , thank you .
so , when did you learn to cook ?
well , uh , when rachel left , i had no choice .
i was either gonna watch the food network a couple times a week ,
or grace and i were gonna eat takeout every day .
so ...
speaking of people leaving other people , ma ...
speaking of grace , what time does she get out of school ?
i &apos;m dying to see my grandbaby .
okay , ma ...
yeah ?
ah , here we go .
listen ...
yeah , here we go .
you cannot come here and tell me you &apos;re getting divorced ,
and then not explain what &apos;s going on . all right ?
so please tell me what is going on ,
because when i came home for dad &apos;s birthday ,
everything seemed fine .
apart from me crying on your shoulder
because he used our vacation fund
to buy a stupid sports car ?
okay , if it &apos;s about the money ,
about the trip , i @-@ i &apos;ll treat you guys .
i &apos;ll pay for the trip myself .
no , no , it &apos;s not about the money ,
it &apos;s not about the vacation fund--
it &apos;s the fact that your father always said
that when he retired , it would be our time .
it would be our time to travel ,
it would be our time to take dancing lessons ,
it would be ...
our time to fall in love all over again .
and he has not kept that promise .
i mean , this is the third act of my life , sweetheart .
you know ? i want it to be great .
so if i can &apos;t have our time ,
i &apos;m gonna have my time .
because i deserve that .
i &apos;m gonna set the table .
according to the airline ,
guy ingram purchased a one @-@ way ticket
to los angeles a few days before he was murdered .
okay , uh , one @-@ way , so he wasn &apos;t planning on coming back .
maybe he knew that somebody was after him
and he decided to skip town .
he wasn &apos;t going alone .
according to his itinerary ,
he purchased a second ticket , same flight , same day .
乘客姓名 盖伊 · 英格拉姆 莎莉 · 安 · 考德威尔
passenger &apos;s name was sally ann caldwell .
and the airline said that she didn &apos;t make the flight , either .
what do we know about sally ann caldwell ?
由火奴鲁鲁飞往洛杉矶 八月七日
not much . i ran her name through the local dmv , came up empty .
well , there &apos;s got to be something .
i mean , he bought her a ticket , right ?
they &apos;ve got to be connected somehow . we need to find her .
csu was able to pull some prints from the plaster behind the wall .
we checked afis , got no hits ,
but we &apos;re still running them through other databases .
also got an interesting lead
on one of ingram &apos;s coworkers .
cherie tranton .
recognize her ?
yeah .
she provided us intel on the hutchins murder .
according to the office manager ,
she and guy ingram were very competitive .
so after he supposedly left town ,
she aggressively took over all his listings .
we &apos;re talking dozens of commissions
on high @-@ end real estate transactions .
that &apos;s a lot of cash .
that &apos;s definitely motive .
and as a real estate agent ,
she had access to the crime scene .
let &apos;s see if cherie tranton &apos;s also got any carpentry skills , huh ?
copy that .
yeah . danny , what &apos;s up ?
okay , uh , in ten minutes , you were gonna call me
and tell me there &apos;s a very urgent situation
that needs my immediate attention ,
and you need me in the office right away , okay ?
can you do that , please ?
i &apos;m sorry . you want me to lie so you can ditch your mom ?
yes , i do , okay ?
this divorce thing &apos;s got my head spinning ,
and , uh , i just need some time .
i need some time alone , okay ?
so why don &apos;t you just tell her that , danny ?
well , because if i tell her i need some time alone ,
she &apos;ll say , &quot; me , too . let &apos;s go together . &quot;
that &apos;s the way she is .
can you just please do this for me , please ?
okay , fine , but next side street is on you .
really ? &apos; cause it &apos;s always on me .
okay , well , you just owe me one then .
what is it with you ?
everything is so mercenary .
you can &apos;t just do a friend a solid ?
you can &apos;t do that out of the kindness of your heart ?
daniel , the fancy lunch you made is getting cold .
i have to go . please just say yes ?
okay .
thank you . ten minutes .
captain grover .
let me guess . sean hutton .
mcgarrett already filled me in .
i got nothing to say to you .
i know all about the molina case .
and i think
it might not have been handled the way it should have been .
yeah ? well , chicago pd may beg to differ .
see , i was investigated thoroughly , and i was cleared .
well , the brass was looking out for you .
believe me , i know that happens .
yet , six months later , you quit the department anyway .
see , that &apos;s the part that i can &apos;t figure out .
you had a great thing going on there .
why come all the way out here
where you &apos;ve got no one to protect you ?
i don &apos;t need anybody to protect me ,
&apos;cause i do my job right .
then give me your side .
convince me that i &apos;m wrong about you , captain ,
and the whole story changes .
what , are we pals now , or something ?
you &apos;re gonna look out for me ?
all right .
you &apos;re not giving me a choice here .
24 hours . if i don &apos;t hear your side ,
i run what i have .
and believe me , you &apos;re not gonna like it , captain .
now , you &apos;re not threatening me now , are you , son ?
i &apos;m just telling you .
24 hours .
the ball &apos;s in your court .
honestly , you can call me any time .
i never sleep . i &apos;m like a zombie . here .
my number &apos;s right there . come back again .
bye .
aloha .
is this not the dream house ?
it has everything ,
and the owners just reduced the price .
they &apos;re super motivated to sell .
you two got kids ?
who , us ?
uh , no , we &apos;re not married .
who needs papers nowadays , right ?
all that matters is two people
who love each other need a good roof over their heads .
and this one , by the way , was just retiled .
miss tranton , we &apos;re not here about the house .
okay .
i just can &apos;t believe it .
i @-@ i thought guy moved to los angeles .
i showed that house over 50 times in the last six months .
to think that he was in there ,
in that wall the whole time .
why would someone do that to him ?
how many commissions did you cash in on
after mr. ingram disappeared ?
what are you insinuating ?
that i had something to do with his murder ?
we understand the two of you were extremely competitive .
we fought over every listing , okay ?
that is the nature of the real estate business here .
it &apos;s a small island . there &apos;s only so many big deals .
but why would i kill guy ?
he was moving to los angeles .
well , maybe he changed his mind .
maybe he decided to hang onto those pricey listings .
you are barking up the wrong tree .
okay . well , then you wouldn &apos;t mind if we took some fingerprints .
knock yourselves out .
hey , charlie , what &apos;s up ?
okay , got it . we &apos;re on our way .
so , ballistics got a hit on the slug we pulled out of ingram .
it matches a weapon used in a jewelry store heist two years ago .
hpd closed the case
and the weapon was recovered and vouchered .
if that gun is sitting in an evidence room ,
how was it used to kill our vic ?
my mother is definitely serious
about this divorce thing .
okay .
she &apos;s serious today .
danny , give her a couple days to think about it ,
you know , let it sink in ...
i &apos;m telling you , okay , she has made up her mind .
my mother is singing in my kitchen .
she &apos;s singing &quot; i saw the sign . &quot;
you know that song , &quot; i saw the sign &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know the song .
okay , well , let me explain the song to you , okay ?
it goes like this . &quot; i saw the sign .
it opened up my mind .
and now i am happy living without you . &quot;
you know the one ?
sing me a couple bars .
just the first couple ...
you sing me a couple bars .
do me a favor . you gonna bust my chops right now ?
i &apos;m trying ... - look , i don &apos;t get it , all right ? it &apos;s a song .
it &apos;s a song .
it &apos;s just a song .
it &apos;s a song that is about being happy and moving on in life .
the horror .
look , it &apos;s not just the song .
she &apos;s saying some very disturbing things .
she &apos;s talking about &quot; me time , &quot; right ?
third act of her life . it &apos;s all very unsettling
to hear from your mother , trust me .
next thing , she &apos;ll be dating .
why would you say that to me ?
well , because it &apos;s a natural ...
why would you say ...
you were getting there .
i was not getting there . i would never get there .
this is my mother we &apos;re talking about .
yeah . who , danny , if we &apos;re being honest ,
happens to be a beautiful woman .
what , she &apos;s not gonna date again ?
oh ! enough ! that &apos;s it !
no more talking about it , okay ?
fine , okay .
i should have my head examined
for coming here asking you advice in the first place .
your mother ,
she couldn &apos;t even get divorced like a normal human being .
she had to pretend she was dead to get away from your father !
what ?
take it easy .
i &apos;m supportive of my mother , okay ?
when she lets me .
uh @-@ huh .
that &apos;s , uh , just the slightest bit of revisionist history .
excuse me ?
well , i was there
when you brought her home from japan ,
and , uh , you wouldn &apos;t even look at her in the face
and you wouldn &apos;t call her &quot; mom . &quot;
yeah , because doris and i had some issues , okay ,
when she got back from japan after 20 years .
and then what happened ? i was supportive .
your mom needs you , danny .
just be there for her .
sure , i remember that case .
the owner was shot during a robbery .
we caught the guy ,
he &apos;s doing a ten @-@ year bit in halawa .
okay , and that weapon was logged into evidence ?
it went from here to the courthouse and back .
if you got a hit to that gun ,
it &apos;s gotta be a mistake .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s the case you &apos;re looking for .
it &apos;s gone .
thanks for coming , man .
of course .
i take it you met sean hutton .
oh , yeah .
yeah , i met sean hutton , all right .
he &apos;s a ... he &apos;s a man on a mission .
he &apos;s gonna put out this story whether
he gets all the facts or not .
okay , well , you gotta talk to him .
i don &apos;t even think that &apos;s gonna change his mind .
what , you &apos;re saying he &apos;s right ?
i &apos;m saying it &apos;s complicated .
back in chicago ,
i was on the department fast track .
i &apos;d gone from being a uniform
to head of swat in 15 years .
one night we get a call .
hostage situation .
guy &apos;s name is jorge molina .
and jorge was very angry with his ex @-@ wife .
she goes over to his place to pick up their two @-@ year @-@ old son
for her visitation , he locks her out of the place .
then he tells her he &apos;s got a gun .
and he &apos;s threatening the boy
and he &apos;s threatening to harm himself ,
so we come over there .
set up a perimeter .
and i get on the phone with him .
why not a hostage negotiator ?
because i knew jorge .
back when i was a uniform ,
seemed like every weekend i was over at his parents &apos; house
on a domestic call , so
i earned his trust , and , uh ...
i thought for sure he &apos;d listen to me .
jorge .
who &apos;s this ? !
this is captain grover , you remember me , right ?
oh , yeah , yeah . i remember you .
all right , jorge , listen , i know you ,
what you doing in there scaring everybody ?
man , i know you don &apos;t want to hurt nobody .
especially your baby .
she wants to take him away from me .
and i don &apos;t want to give him up .
i want to see him .
i understand , i understand that .
but i got you on that , i &apos;m gonna help you with that .
all you got to do is come outside and surrender to me .
a second later i &apos;m gonna be on the phone with cps .
i &apos;m gonna vouch for you and i &apos;m gonna tell them
you &apos;re a good guy . well ...
okay . yeah , yeah , you were always good to me and my family .
i had him , man . i had him .
to this day , i don &apos;t know what set him off .
jorge , you got to listen to me .
captain , jenkins says he has the shot .
i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t think so .
listen to me , listen to me , jorge .
look at me . look at me , i &apos;m taking off my vest .
huh ? i &apos;m taking off my gun .
the snipers radioed in and said they had a shot
through the front window .
but i made &apos; em hold off .
you want to point that gun at somebody , you point it at me .
we can take him down .
all we need is the green light .
okay ? i trust you .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m out here like this .
just need the green light , captain .
all you have to do
is walk outside
captain .
with your hands in the air .
we just need the go @-@ ahead .
and everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
i made the decision to wait .
you can trust me .
no , you &apos;re lying .
you &apos;re lying just to get me out there .
you &apos;re lying !
no , i &apos;ve always been straight with you .
just give us the green light .
anything that i &apos;ve ever
told you i &apos;m gonna do , i always do .
captain .
we can take him down .
isn &apos;t that right ? isn &apos;t that right ?
just give us the green light ,
captain .
i &apos;m always gonna be straight ...
i can &apos;t come out .
all right , come on outside with me .
i &apos;m sorry .
come on , come on .
just come out with your hands up .
it &apos;s too late ! it &apos;s too late .
all right ?
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s too late .
captain .
do we have a green light ?
no , no , no . it &apos;s not too late , son .
let us take the shot .
it &apos;s not too late .
it &apos;s too late .
captain .
it looks bad , but it &apos;s not too late .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry !
i &apos;m so sorry .
no , don &apos;t say that , son . don &apos;t say that !
i will kill him !
no , jorge ,
don &apos;t do it ! you don &apos;t want to do that .
you &apos;re not a ... no !
so i go into the house , and they &apos;re both dead .
and his little boy , christian ...
... he was lying on the floor ...
... with his blanket ...
little stuffed animal .
blood everywhere .
i hope you never see something like that , man ,
because you &apos;ll remember it for the rest of your life .
you made a call , lou . all right ?
it &apos;s not your fault , what happened .
that &apos;s what they told me !
that &apos;s what i told myself .
but i still couldn &apos;t get past the idea
that if i had just done one thing ,
just one thing different ...
that that little boy would still be alive .
chicago pd cleared me .
but i couldn &apos;t get past it .
and i &apos;m fightin &apos; with my wife ,
and i &apos;m yellin &apos; at my kids ...
the best friend i had in the world ,
i get into a little argument with him
and i end up punching the guy .
and i spent so many nights ,
late at night ,
pacing the floor in my living room ,
on my eighth beer ,
my ninth beer , my tenth beer .
and i &apos;m angry and i &apos;m trying to ...
i &apos;m counting all the people that pissed me off that day .
and i &apos;m asking , &quot; what the hell is wrong with everybody ? &quot;
well , eventually ...
... i figured out what the problem was .
and it was me .
and unless i wanted to ruin my career and wreck my marriage ,
i had to get the hell out of chicago , man .
because driving down those streets ,
every little kid i saw ...
was christian molina .
so ...
i put in for the job out here .
i figured , why not put
6,000 miles and an ocean between me and my problems ?
and then this sean hutton comes around .
and he &apos;s bringing it all right back to my front door ,
and i &apos;m gonna have to deal with this all over again .
all the guilt .
all the questions .
you &apos;ve got my full support .
all right ?
i really appreciate that , man .
that &apos;s why i come down here to talk to you .
i know you got things you &apos;re keeping inside
and you gotta get these things off your chest ,
or i swear , they &apos;re gonna press the air right out of you .
and then you &apos;re gonna end up just like m ...
you know what i &apos;m trying to say , right ?
yeah .
hello , sweetheart .
ma , i , uh ...
just got home .
thought maybe we , uh ... could have a talk .
where , uh ... where are you ?
at the hilton .
we &apos;re just hanging by the pool .
we ?
who &apos;s &quot; we &quot; ?
what are you ... what , are you on a date , ma ?
i am , actually .
with my beautiful granddaughter .
that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s completely impossible ,
because your granddaughter &apos;s in school right now .
well , i might have taken her out of school a little bit early .
early ?
yes , but in my defense , we were doing
something very educational .
we were learning how to apply foundation .
apply foundation ...
i don &apos;t know what that means .
we got makeovers .
oh , you had makeovers !
like with makeup on everybody &apos;s faces .
well , yes , that &apos;s how you usually do it .
can you do me a favor and send a picture of my daughter to me ?
right now , please ? on the telephone ?
okay . coming right up .
okay , he wants a picture .
okay , say &quot; yolo . &quot;
yolo .
you &apos;re so pretty .
thank you .
got it ?
oh , god ...
oh , relax .
no , ma , you relax .
nice retort , sweetheart .
okay , look .
um ... operation , uh , corrupt my daughter
is now officially over .
i &apos;d like you two to come home now , please , if that &apos;s okay .
thank you .
thanks for coming .
change your mind about going on record ?
no .
i &apos;m afraid not , sean .
listen , i know what happened in chicago , all right ?
and your facts may be right .
but you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re way off base about captain grover .
he &apos;s a good man , and he &apos;s a great cop .
who made the wrong call and got a little boy killed .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m surprised
by your support for him , commander .
one of the first things
that grover did when he rode into town
was file a grievance against you .
which was withdraw .
so , what ?
you @-@ you owe him a favor , now ?
no , that &apos;s not how it works .
why are you defending him ?
i don &apos;t get you .
you don &apos;t get me .
no , you don &apos;t get me .
you non @-@ operators , you sit on the sidelines
and you judge us in the field .
you have no idea what it &apos;s like .
the hard decisions we have to make every day going downrange ,
and the consequences that we have to live with forever .
are you speaking for captain grover ,
or are you speaking for yourself ?
i &apos;m speaking for anyone who &apos;s ever had to do this job .
i &apos;m also asking you ...
leave this one alone , huh ?
go ahead .
go wash your face right now .
are you mad , danno ?
no , i &apos;m not mad . do i look mad ?
go .
come on in .
i &apos;m sorry .
i just wanted to go have a little fun
with my granddaughter .
got it . it &apos;s fine .
ma ... that &apos;s fine .
here &apos;s what i don &apos;t get .
i don &apos;t get how it is that you are having fun .
it doesn &apos;t make sense to me .
i mean , you &apos;re dancing in the kitchen ,
you &apos;re singing songs ,
you &apos;re doing makeovers ,
going to the pool , having a blast .
i mean , i ... i &apos;m confused .
aren &apos;t @-@ aren &apos;t you upset ? aren &apos;t you sad ?
of course i &apos;m sad .
you think because i have
a song stuck in my head
that i &apos;m not sad ?
i don &apos;t know .
i want to cry all the time , honey .
i &apos;m sorry i took grace out of school .
it &apos;s just , when you left for work ,
i found myself extremely lonely here ,
and wandering around with nothing to do .
okay . i already said that &apos;s fine . okay .
ma , can we talk now ? please ?
ever since your father retired ,
he has a million different hobbies and @-@ and interests .
and not one of them involves being with me .
you &apos;re here with gracie ,
matt &apos;s on the run somewhere ,
the girls are busy with their own families ,
and i went from being
the busiest woman in the world ,
raising you guys , cooking , cleaning ,
couponing , pta @-@ ing ,
to having absolutely nothing but time on my hands .
all right , so maybe you need a hobby , too , you know .
no , i don &apos;t need a hobby ,
sweetheart , i need a life .
like a real life .
a life with love and romance and companionship .
please don &apos;t think that i did not try
to make this marriage work .
i never worked harder at anything in my life .
and i know this is hurting you , but ...
no , mom , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s ...
yeah . no , i know it is .
and i know that it doesn &apos;t really matter
how old you are or how much your dad and i love you ,
it &apos;s still a tough thing for you to handle ,
the thought of us being apart .
and i am so sorry for that .
okay , well , i appreciate that , mom . i do .
i apologize myself .
i obviously have not been very supportive , okay ?
but just so you know , uh ,
the hardest day of my life was not when rachel told me
that she was leaving me , okay ?
it was when we had to sit down and tell grace .
that was , that was tough ,
you know ?
and she , you know , she @-@ she @-@ she tried not to cry .
and she was , you know , trying to be big about it ,
but i know that , uh , that we were her anchor ,
just like you and pop are to me .
that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s tough thinking about losing that ,
so ...
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t be sorry .
hey . so , i was doing a little digging
on the chain of custody of our missing weapon .
where is it ?
well , i &apos;ll tell you where it &apos;s not .
melted into scrap metal ,
which is what was supposed to happen seven months ago
when the prosecuting attorney &apos;s office put through the order .
duke had no idea
because the p.a. &apos; s office misfiled the paperwork .
okay , so somewhere between the evidence room
and the metalworks , that .22 just disappeared .
and whoever got their hands on it killed guy ingram .
we cross @-@ check the serial numbers
to the police report number ,
then they &apos;re put into a bin and wheeled down to our smelter
where they &apos;re melted down at 3,100 degrees .
done and done .
well , maybe you can explain
how a weapon that was supposed to be destroyed by you ended
up being used in a homicide six months ago ?
no idea .
but here &apos;s the paperwork .
whose signature is on these receipt vouchers ?
george moku .
he &apos;s the yard boss .
how long has he worked for you ?
ever since i married his sister .
you trust your brother @-@ in @-@ law , mr. chan ?
he &apos;s family . i don &apos;t have a choice .
i &apos;ll take that as an undecided .
here &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking : your brother @-@ in @-@ law george
has a nice little side business going on .
he tags the guns as destroyed ,
and then resells them on the street as untraceable .
i don &apos;t believe this .
well , you better believe it &apos; cause it &apos;s happening .
now where do we find him ?
he &apos;s called in sick today .
let me guess . that happens every time
a shipment of weapons comes in to be destroyed .
they &apos;re all clean . untraceable .
so what do you say ? you see something you like ?
hey , what the hell &apos;s going on ? ! bruddah , are you setting us up ?
hey , i swear , there &apos;s nothing going on .
look for yourself .
don &apos;t move .
have i mentioned it &apos;s good to have you back ?
don &apos;t worry . the wound , you &apos;ll survive .
but a life sentence in halawa , that &apos;s a different story .
life ? i just repurposed those weapons
to the good folks of oahu looking to protect themselves .
you sold this .22 six months ago . i want a name .
come on , lady , i &apos;m shot here .
what the hell are you doing ? !
don &apos;t worry , george , we &apos;re not gonna let you bleed to death .
we &apos;re just gonna let it get to the point
where the damage to your arm is so bad ,
they &apos;re gonna have to amputate .
you can &apos;t do this !
you can &apos;t shoot at cops either , but you did .
if i give you a name , will you take me to the hospital ?
start talking , george .
gerard burns the defense attorney ?
the guy &apos;s made a lot of money representing
some questionable people .
doesn &apos;t make sense . why would
he buy a gun to kill guy ingram ? what &apos;s the connection ?
burns &apos; wife .
meet sally ann burns .
but we know her better as sally ann caldwell .
the name on the other plane ticket .
the reason we couldn &apos;t find her is because she hasn &apos;t used
her maiden name in over 20 years .
so guy ingram and burns &apos; wife were gonna run away together .
burns must &apos;ve found out and made sure that didn &apos;t happen .
all right , how do we get to sally ann ?
we don &apos;t .
burns reported her missing six months ago .
well , it &apos;s about time .
do you know how long i &apos;ve been sitting in this damn box ?
we &apos;re sorry to pull you off
the golf course , mr. burns .
although , it did look like you were down a few strokes .
the first rule when you &apos;re playing with clients ,
lieutenant , let &apos; em beat you .
it &apos;s a good way to win friends and influence people .
we know you bought a gun
from george moku seven months ago .
and we know you used that gun to murder guy ingram .
what the hell are you talking about ?
we know that your wife , sally , was having an affair with guy .
and now he &apos;s dead and she &apos;s missing .
you see , we got moku in custody ,
and he &apos;s signing his statement right now .
so what if i buy a gun from mr. moku ?
that gun was stolen from my home before my wife disappeared .
you know , our hpd crime scene guys don &apos;t get enough credit .
they really do amazing work .
in fact , they do such amazing work ,
that they recovered dozens of fingerprints , yes ,
from behind plaster wall where you hid ingram &apos;s body .
so , okay , counselor , you know how this works .
we take your fingerprints and we compare &apos; em
to the ones we found at the crime scene .
and my guess is that &apos;s not gonna work out for you so well .
you know ... she said there was nothing between the two of them .
i knew she was lying .
where &apos;s your wife , gerard ?
she &apos;s exactly where she should be .
what are you saying ?
she wanted to spend eternity with her lover ,
so i gave her that .
book him .
hey , you okay ?
i just wanted to come by and say thank you .
what are you talking about ?
oh , come on . stop playing .
i just talked to the guy .
he says he &apos;s gonna pull the story .
well , there you go . congratulations .
so what &apos;d it cost you ?
i just appealed to his better angels .
and when that didn &apos;t work , then what did you do ?
i told him i &apos;d owe him one .
quid pro quo .
yeah . you know ,
that &apos;s gonna come around and bite you in the ass , right ?
ah , maybe .
that &apos;s a problem for another day , though , right ?
listen , man , i , uh ,
i really appreciate you telling me about chicago .
well , perhaps someday you &apos;ll tell me why you came back home .
yeah , someday .
ma ?
ma ?
yeah ?
you should get up and go to bed .
i &apos;m watching &quot; housewives . &quot;
ah , i see .
okay , you stay here .
thank you .
sleep good .
night .
night . i love you , daniel .
love you , too , mom .
busted .
just to the end of this chapter , please ?
no @-@ no @-@ no @-@ no @-@ no .
much as i like to see you read ,
it is way past your bedtime , come on .
good night . give me the flashlight .
anybody else in here ?
i hope not .
yeah , me , too .
well , sleep cosy .
good ? yeah ?
you remember when , uh ,
when me and your mom , we sat you down and told you
we weren &apos;t gonna be married anymore ?
i &apos;m really sorry i had to put you through that .
i know it was tough .
i know it was hard for you , daddy .
hard for me ? no , what do you mean ?
how do you know anything ? you were just a little kid .
i remember after you told me ,
you went to your room , and i could hear you crying .
you know , if you , uh , if you got the time ,
i don &apos;t know , maybe one of those special hugs .
i could use it right now .
yeah , thanks .
thank you . oh , thank you for that , too .
