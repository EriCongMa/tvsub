monica ? hey , can i borrow the porsche ?
okay .
all right !
but what is it not ?
a place to entertain my lady friends .
and what else is it not ?
a place to eat spaghetti .
very good . what do you need it for anyway ?
the powerball lottery is up to 300 million ..
and they don &apos;t sell tickets here .
so you &apos;re driving up to connecticut ?
yeah , connecticut . not west virginia .
maybe i &apos;ll drive you up there . i &apos;d like to buy some tickets myself .
yeah , with chandler not getting paid , we could really use $ 300 million .
yes , because if i was at my old job , we &apos;d say , &quot; 300 million ? no , thank you . &quot;
will you get me tickets too ?
yeah , me too .
sure .
i have an idea .
why don &apos;t we all pitch in 50 bucks , we &apos;ll pool our money together ..
and then if we win , we &apos;ll split it .
that &apos;s a great idea !
no , thanks .
you don &apos;t wanna win the lottery ?
sure i do .
i also want to be king of my own country ..
and find out what happened to amelia earhart .
still on amelia earhart ?
the woman just vanished !
seriously , you don &apos;t want in on this ?
no . do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery ?
i mean , you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times .
but there &apos;s six of us , so we &apos;d only have to get struck 7 times .
i like those odds !
seriously , you guys , i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re gonna spend $ 250 on the lottery .
i mean , that &apos;s such a bunch of boo @-@ hockey .
i &apos;ll ask .
&quot; boo @-@ hockey &quot; ?
oh , we think emma &apos;s about to start talking ..
so we &apos;re trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her .
so get ready to hear a lot of boo @-@ hockey ..
gosh darn it and brother pucker .
how do you know she &apos;s gonna start talking ?
when i talk to her , i almost feel like she understands what i &apos;m saying .
kind of like joey .
what &apos;s that now ?
the.one.with.the.lottery
god , look at all these tickets . it &apos;s so exciting .
i haven &apos;t won anything since sixth grade .
pie @-@ eating contest ?
you assume because i was heavy that &apos;s the only way i could win something ?
no , i saw a picture of you covered in blueberries .
that was a good day .
yeah .
they &apos;re towing your car !
i &apos;m parked in a garage on morton .
they &apos;re towing a car .
and i am seeing spots .
ross , you don &apos;t have emma ! rachel , you don &apos;t have emma !
where &apos;s emma ? who has emma ?
joey , relax .
my mother picked her up two hours ago . you were there .
i was ?
yes , and you talked to her .
i did ?
she dropped off a casserole .
oh , yeah , the casserole lady .
did you come by to watch us win the big bucks ?
yeah . and then i figured after you win , we can all go out to the balcony ..
and see a night rainbow
with gremlins dancing on top of it .
don &apos;t touch the phone ! i &apos;ll get it !
you think he washed his hands ?
hello ?
hey , charlie , what do you know ?
what &apos;s going on ?
chandler &apos;s supposed to find out if he &apos;s getting a job at his agency .
but out of 15 interns , they &apos;re only hiring three .
tough odds .
yeah .
if only it were a sure thing
like your 24 @-@ state lottery
yeah , look who &apos;s coming around !
damn it . all right , call me when you know more .
did you get it ?
one of the slots got filled .
by you ?
sense the tone .
no , that kid nate got it .
oh , i hate that guy .
i mean , come on , kid , pull up your pants !
well , there &apos;s two spots left , right ?
yeah . i mean , i want this so much . i wanna get one .
i want my friend charlie to get one .
except i don &apos;t care about charlie .
hey , you guys .
hey !
you are not gonna believe this . i just saw my psychic ..
and she said i was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight !
i thought we could use some extra luck ..
so i brought a wishbone home from work .
a psychic and a wishbone ? guys , give someone else a chance .
all right , who wants to do it ?
can i ?
vegetarians never get to do the wishbone .
it &apos;s really not fair . just because we don &apos;t eat the meat ..
doesn &apos;t mean we don &apos;t like to play with the carcasses .
all right . rach ?
i don &apos;t want that turkey smell all over my hands .
i &apos;ll do it ! it &apos;ll get the casserole stink off of mine .
i hope i win .
well , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
you &apos;re both wishing for the same thing .
i can &apos;t tell you what i &apos;m wishing for , or else , you know , it won &apos;t come true .
right . but we know what you &apos;re wishing for .
i can &apos;t really say .
i understand .
but you &apos;re wishing for what we think , aren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m not really comfortable with these questions !
please !
just do it !
okay . one , two , three .
i won ! hey !
you know what ? i &apos;m sure your wish is gonna come true .
but , you guys , just in case , maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp .
that thing gets hot !
ross , just keep making your jokes .
how are you gonna feel if we actually do win ?
you &apos;re not gonna win .
i know the odds are against us ..
but somebody has to win , and it could be us . and then how you gonna feel ?
we &apos;re gonna be like , &quot; everybody , let &apos;s take our helicopters up to the cape . &quot;
and you &apos;re gonna be all , like , &quot; oh , i can &apos;t , guys .
i &apos;ll have to meet you up there . i gotta gas up the hyundai . &quot;
okay , i &apos;ve heard myself on tape , and i sound nothing like that .
i can see the headline now : &quot; lottery winners &apos; friend ..
filled with regret , eats own arm . &quot;
why would i eat my own arm ?
well , you wouldn &apos;t , but we own the paper . we can print whatever we want .
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna throw in 50 bucks for you .
why ?
because i know that you think ..
that the lottery is boo @-@ hockey ..
but we &apos;re all here , and we &apos;re gonna watch the numbers and have fun .
and you &apos;re my brother , and i want you to be a part of this .
you don &apos;t have to do that . i mean , i &apos;ll pay for myself .
but just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys , that &apos;s so sweet .
come here .
get a room .
so now that you &apos;re in , what are you gonna do if we win ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ll probably just invest it .
calm down .
seriously , that &apos;s your fantasy ? to invest it ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . did i say , &quot; invest it &quot; ? i meant , &quot; be cool and piss it all away . &quot;
i know ! we should pool all our money and buy the knicks !
i don &apos;t really care about the knicks .
you will when i pick you as starting forward .
you would do that ? i never get picked !
i &apos;m not sure a sports team is the way to go .
you won &apos;t let me buy the knicks ? i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re taking this away .
you &apos;re right , it has been your dream for over 15 seconds .
how long until they announce the numbers , mommy ?
i &apos;ll take this one too . &quot; mommy &quot; ?
oh , i &apos;ve gotten into the habit of calling rachel ..
&quot; mommy &quot; when we &apos;re around emma .
which i now realize we are not .
i &apos;m hoping that if she hears it enough , it &apos;ll be her first word .
although if we &apos;re gonna do that , we should probably call me &quot; daddy &quot; too .
i like that , daddy .
i was just talking about rachel .
is daddy getting angry ?
is daddy gonna spank me ?
well , that depends .
have you been a bad .. ? no , i can &apos;t .
hello ? hello ? hey , charlie . did anybody else hear ?
what ? susan got it ? how ?
oh , man , i would &apos;ve slept with him !
all right , bye .
dude , i &apos;m sorry . but hey , there &apos;s one spot left , right ?
well , charlie &apos;s gonna get that .
hey , don &apos;t say that .
you &apos;ve got just as good a chance of getting that job .
he is the boss &apos; son .
come on , lottery !
yeah !
it starts in , like , 20 minutes .
okay , here we go .
we need to sort through the tickets quickly to see if we &apos;ve won .
so does anybody have any ideas how to organize this ?
okay , how about this :
we divide them into six groups of 40 .
the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes first .
i have another idea .
i &apos;m sorry , idea time is over .
well , are all the tickets in the bowl ?
yeah .
what about the ones on the nightstand ?
there are no tickets there .
yes , there are . i just saw them a few minutes ago .
no , you didn &apos;t . you must be mistaken .
there are 20 tickets on the nightstand .
chandler , sense the tone .
well , well , well . look what mommy found .
okay , fine . i bought 20 extra tickets for me and chandler .
the psychic also said that i would be betrayed .
i can &apos;t believe this . i thought we were all in this together .
hey , you just got in five minutes ago !
three minutes ago !
i don &apos;t know why that &apos;s important .
i was with you the whole time . when did you even get those ?
when you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic .
i &apos;ll show you how .
okay . well , monica , suppose one of your special tickets wins ?
how are you gonna feel when you win and lose your friends ?
please . if i win the lottery , you guys are not gonna leave me .
someone gave me muffins last week , and i couldn &apos;t get rid of you for three days !
chandler , would you just tell her what she did was wrong ?
she &apos;s right . you shouldn &apos;t have bought tickets just for us .
let me finish .
however , it doesn &apos;t look like i &apos;m gonna get this job ..
so i can &apos;t afford to have principles . so screw you ! the tickets are ours !
there &apos;s the man i married .
all right . believe me , if you win the lottery ..
it &apos;s the last you &apos;re gonna hear from us .
fine . don &apos;t be my friends . i &apos;ll buy new friends .
yeah , and then i &apos;ll pay for their plastic surgery so they look just like you !
you know what ? i want my share of the tickets .
i want my tickets too ! and i &apos;m buying the knicks !
and steffi graf !
cool . then i want mine too ! and if i win ..
i &apos;m gonna put it all into a very low @-@ yield bond !
no . you guys , we gotta keep all the tickets together .
no . no , we should divide them up ..
and i should get extra because we used my car !
hey ! hey ! if anybody gets extra tickets , it should be me !
this whole thing was my idea !
yeah . thanks for inventing the lottery !
just give them to me , and i &apos;ll split them up !
hey , hey !
god , i can &apos;t take it anymore ! i &apos;m putting an end to this !
okay , if she jumps , i get her tickets !
wait , no , no ! hey !
if we &apos;re not doing this together , we &apos;re not doing it at all .
say goodbye to your tickets .
no ! no ! no !
do not come any closer !
can i come a little bit closer ? valuable things are getting squished .
now , what &apos;s more important , your friends or money ?
friends !
money !
friends .
hey , monica , what about your extra tickets ?
they &apos;re all in there .
even these five that i hid in my bra .
monica !
okay . good . you guys were so scared .
there is no way i was gonna dump this ..
god ! no !
i think i broke your bowl .
go ! go ! go !
what a beautiful night to be running around the street , looking for tickets .
and the wind sure made it fun .
phoebe , we lost half of them .
so what ?
monica , we have the winning ticket .
my psychic said i was gonna win , remember ?
weird your psychic didn &apos;t mention anything about the scary pigeon .
as a matter of fact , she said that &apos;s how i &apos;m going to die .
so excuse me for being a little skittish .
there &apos;s two messages . this could be from work .
oh , play them .
okay . here we go .
hello . this is the pigeon from the balcony calling to apologize .
i shouldn &apos;t have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady &apos;s hand .
it was all my fault . not hers . bye .
well , i bet that was very hard for him to do .
hey , chandler , it &apos;s charlie .
this is it .
listen , it turns out i got the last spot .
i &apos;m really sorry , man . it was a lot of fun working with you .
give me a call if you want .
gosh , i &apos; m so sorry , honey .
sorry , chandler .
it is so unfair . it &apos;s like that time they promoted saundra over me at work .
was she related to ralph lauren ?
no , she was just much better at her job than me .
you guys , the drawing &apos;s about to start .
we should call my mom &apos;s and say good night to emma ..
before she goes down .
good idea .
honey , you &apos;re being really strong about this .
i know how badly you wanted that job .
yeah , you know , i really thought i deserved it .
but let &apos;s go win the lottery . i mean , we still have a 130 chances to win , right ?
hundred and thirty @-@ one .
yeah , good night , sweetheart . i love you .
and remember , you &apos;re daddy &apos;s little girl .
phoebe &apos;s totally ruined that for me .
hi , mom . put her back on .
rach , they &apos;re announcing the numbers !
my god , i can already feel myself changing .
here are your official powerball numbers . we have 53 .
i &apos;ve got that .
we have one too !
we are on the road , people !
come on !
mom , please , i know you love your new lips , but i can barely understand you .
would you please just let me say good night to my daughter ?
and here we go . the powerball is seven .
all right , check your numbers ! make me rich .
you guys , you &apos;re not gonna believe this .
i was just saying good night to emma , and she said her first words .
what ?
well , what did she say ?
she said , &quot; gleba &quot; !
make me rich !
isn &apos;t that amazing ?
oh , yeah . no , no , no , that &apos;s great .
why aren &apos;t you more excited ?
rach , gleba is not a word .
well , of course it is .
okay . what does it mean ?
well , i don &apos;t know all the words .
you know , i &apos;m just glad i didn &apos;t miss my daughter &apos;s first word .
yes you did ! gleba is a word !
okay . use it in a sentence .
okay . emma just said , &quot; gleba . &quot;
it &apos;s not a word .
okay , fine . i &apos;m gonna look it up .
okay , great .
while you &apos;re at it , she said another word the other day .
why don &apos;t you look up :
all right . okay . okay . gleba . gleba . gleba . gleba !
here it is ! &quot; the fleshy , spore @-@ bearing inner mass of a certain fungi . &quot;
she &apos;s gonna be a scientist .
damn it . anybody got anything ?
no .
i &apos;m still looking through mine .
just double @-@ checking . no .
no . no .
no !
hello ? hold on .
it &apos;s your boss .
the &quot; i &apos;m sorry i rejected you &quot; phone call .
i &apos;m not used to getting these from guys .
hey , steve .
chandler , hi .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve heard we filled the three positions .
we felt that with your maturity and experience ..
you wouldn &apos;t be happy being someone &apos;s assistant .
i &apos;d love to be somebody &apos;s assistant . answering phones ..
getting coffee , i live for that stuff .
and i &apos;m not too mature . farts , boobies , butt cracks !
chandler , you were the strongest person in the program .
we &apos;re offering you the position of junior copywriter .
me ? that guy who just said , &quot; butt cracks &quot; ?
yes , that &apos;s right .
we &apos;re excited about the level of sophistication ..
you &apos;ll be bringing to the job .
okay . well , thanks , you won &apos;t regret it . i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
what ?
oh , yeah , i &apos;m gonna be a junior copywriter .
congratulations ! oh , sweetie , i &apos;m so proud of you .
thanks . does that mean i get the good loving tonight ?
you bet . no tv or anything .
hey , that is so great about the job .
thanks , man .
i &apos;d like to think i had something to do with it .
really ? why ?
well , before with the wishbone .
i didn &apos;t wish we would win the lottery . i wished you &apos;d get the job .
oh , yeah ?
listen , don &apos;t tell monica . she &apos;ll rip your heart right out .
well , you know what ? there was a little part of me ..
that really thought we were gonna win .
me too . so much for my dinosaur / amelia earhart theme park .
you guys ? what was the powerball number again ?
seven .
we won .
what ?
we won !
let me see ! let me see !
don &apos;t tear it !
phoebe , you don &apos;t have any of the first five numbers !
i know that , but look , we got the powerball number . we won $ 3 !
wow , you think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout ?
i don &apos;t care . i &apos;ve never won anything before . i can &apos;t believe this !
so , phoebe , what are you gonna do with your $ 3 ?
well , it &apos;s not all mine . we all get 50 cents .
you know what ? you can have mine .
me too .
me too .
me too .
well , i guess if everybody else is .
hey , guys . so i just called the powerball hot line .
can you believe it ? nobody won .
i beg to differ .
maybe nobody won the jackpot , but there was this guy in here earlier ..
and he found a ticket on the street right outside and won $ 10,000 .
again , don &apos;t blame the pretty lady .
it was not her fault . it was me , the pigeon .
