desperate housewives s07 e01
ten years ago , carlos &apos; mother died after being hit by a car
that andrew was driving .
orson packed his bags ...
you are not the woman i thought you were .
he &apos;s my son . i had no choice .
and i no longer choose to be your husband .
and bree decided to come clean .
there &apos;s something i need to tell you--
it &apos;s the kind of thing that could end our friendship .
a dying nurse made a confession ...
the people who run this hospital need to know what i did .
how do you tell parents the child they &apos;ve been raising
isn &apos;t really theirs ?
financial worries drove susan to a big decision ...
you can &apos;t sell your house .
we &apos;re not selling . we &apos;re renting .
which led to the return of a long @-@ lost neighbor .
the truth is , i used to live here .
oh , i guess everyone will be surprised to see you again .
they absolutely will .
there was a time when my husband and i were very happy .
i remember warm summer afternoons
and backyard barbecues
and laughter with friends .
our life was like some kind of suburban dream .
but the day comes when we all must wake up .
for me ,
that day came when a letter arrived .
as threats go ,
it was concise and to the point .
i did what i had to to protect my family .
my husband found out who wrote the letter .
he let her know how much this upset him .
her sister figured out what my husband had done .
so she decided to frame him for murder ...
her murder , to be more specific .
and that &apos;s when the dream that was paul young &apos;s life
became a nightmare .
years later ,
a woman was pulled over for speeding .
this woman had no identification ,
so she was arrested .
and that is how people learned that felicia tillman
was very much alive .
i see you got the suit i sent over . you like it ?
i like anything that &apos;s not orange .
well , get ready to do all sorts of shopping .
your settlement check came in .
so where you going first ?
after all these years in prison ,
i bet you &apos;re ready to party .
all i want is to go home .
what ? to your old neighborhood ?
you sound surprised .
none of your neighbors supported you during the trial .
they didn &apos;t visit while you were here .
no one would blame you if you hated them a little .
oh , i don &apos;t hate them ...
a little .
and so my husband returned to wisteria lane .
the neighbors were surprised to see him .
they hadn &apos;t thought about paul young in years .
but he had thought about them .
and he was going to make sure
they &apos;d never forget him again .
the phone call that comes in the middle of the night ...
the letter that arrives by special courier ...
the e @-@ mail marked &quot; urgent ! ... &quot;
yes , there are all sorts of ways
bad news can be delivered .
but some news is so bad ...
it must be delivered in person .
why do i have to tell them ?
you said this couple lives in your neighborhood .
trustees of the hospital feel
that makes you uniquely qualified .
and just what am i supposed to say ?
&quot; great block party .
&quot; by the way , one of our nurses
may have switched your baby at birth . try the dip . &quot;
every minute we wait ,
this hospital takes on more liability .
now get on over to ... wisteria lane
and tell those people what &apos;s going on .
i don &apos;t know how i &apos;m gonna do this .
there &apos;s only one way to deliver news like this :
remain as calm as possible .
bree ! get out here !
damn it ! why is nobody home ?
lorna , gwen ...
oh , thank god .
why , karen . what &apos;s wrong ?
paul young--he &apos;s back .
what ?
you heard me . now don &apos;t just stand there .
we gotta warn people . come on .
bree , i &apos;ve never seen you like this .
are you all right ?
i have something horrible to tell you ,
and i don &apos;t know how to say it .
well , you better think of somethin &apos; .
you &apos;re starting to freak me out .
remember that night
when carlos &apos; mother was run over by a car ?
well , i know who did it .
you what ?
it was andrew .
oh , god !
he was only 16 . i was afraid he was gonna go to jail ...
so rex and i just decided to cover it up .
oh , this is--this is bad . this is really bad .
i need to go throw up a little .
i am so sorry . and i realize i should &apos;ve told you sooner .
no ! no , no , no , you shouldn &apos;t have told me at all !
what ?
now i have to tell carlos ,
and he &apos;s going to kill andrew ,
and then he &apos;s going to have to go to prison ,
so thank you for sending my husband to prison , bree .
nice work !
i just couldn &apos;t live with the secret any longer ,
and when orson found out ,
he told me i was a horrible person .
that &apos;s why you told me ?
oh , please , we &apos;re all horrible people !
you see this ? it &apos;s yours .
they delivered it here . i kept it . horrible !
just so you know , orson was so disgusted ,
he &apos;s divorcing me .
normally , i &apos;d give you a hug ,
but right now i sorta don &apos;t give a crap !
again , very sorry .
god ! how am i gonna tell carlos ?
he is gonna be so angry !
and he &apos;ll probably find a way to blame me !
you &apos;ll never guess who &apos;s back !
mom , we don &apos;t have any clean plates .
didn &apos;t you run the dishwasher ?
we &apos;re also out of milk . you gotta go to the store .
and the dry cleaners while you &apos;re at it .
okay , everybody . look at your hands .
come on . mm @-@ hmm .
anyone not holding a baby , you &apos;re on your own .
you can wash and shop
and clean for yourselves .
my days of being the perfect mom are over .
when were those days , exactly ?
it &apos;s my uterus that &apos;s worn out , not my hearing .
so you &apos;re not gonna help with anything ?
&apos;cause this place is really starting to go to hell .
baby number five .
an entire basketball team has come out of me ,
so i &apos;m officially too exhausted to care .
the good moms enjoy doing stuff for their families .
hello ?
that &apos;s your brother preston . he &apos;s about to be beaten .
yes , he is . yes , he is .
mom , it &apos;s renee perry .
who &apos;s renee perry ?
oh , she &apos;s your mom &apos;s friend from college .
she &apos;s married to doug perry , who plays for the yankees .
and she &apos;s really rich .
how rich ?
every few years , renee flies mom to new york
for a big , fancy weekend .
and mom always comes back in a great mood .
so this might be perfect timing .
damn it to hell . she &apos;s coming here .
wh @-@ when ?
tomorrow .
why ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but that is something we can talk about
when we turn this damn place into an actual home .
okay , people , move , move , move . let &apos;s go !
come on . hey , you , too , tom .
i &apos;m holding the baby .
well , spray her with some glass cleaner
and rub her on the windows .
i don &apos;t want renee to know i live like this .
but , mom , if she &apos;s your friend ,
won &apos;t she like you no matter how you live ?
she &apos;s not that kind of friend .
you &apos;re never gonna believe who &apos;s back .
here we are .
home sweet ...
home .
so ... what do you think , buddy ?
this is where we &apos;re gonna live ?
yeah .
so are we poor ?
if you field this one ,
i &apos;ll tell him where babies come from .
no , honey , we &apos;re not poor .
we &apos;re just ...
lower middle class .
poor people wish they could live like this .
they shouldn &apos;t .
oh , sweetie .
i know this isn &apos;t what we &apos;re used to .
buddy , we &apos;re not gonna lie to you .
money is a little tighter than before ,
but that &apos;s why we &apos;re here--
so we can save up and get back to our house .
and it &apos;s not gonna take that long .
your daddy &apos;s taking on extra jobs ,
and i &apos;m still teaching , and i &apos;m gonna start selling
that really cool jewelry i &apos;ve been making .
oh , god
sweetie , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
and as long as we &apos;re together , we can survive this .
hello ?
susan !
hi , mrs. mccluskey . what &apos;s up ?
you &apos;ll never believe this . paul young is back .
what ? !
where is he ?
where do you think ? he &apos;s in the house you rented to him .
i didn &apos;t know . lee just told me it was a guy .
you didn &apos;t even ask for his name ?
he paid in advance , and he didn &apos;t have pets . i didn &apos;t care .
how is paul even out of jail ?
that maniac was serving a life sentence .
hello , ladies .
if you &apos;d like to come in for a while ,
i &apos;ll tell you the story .
come on now .
it &apos;s a good one .
felicia tillman &apos;s alive ?
why are you so surprised ?
i said that over and over again in my trial .
oh , wait . that &apos;s right .
none of you could make it to the courthouse .
look , paul--
it &apos;s okay . you were busy . i get it .
i told myself i &apos;d explain how i was framed
when you came to visit me in prison . oh , wait .
we &apos;re so sorry .
in our defense , we thought you were a cold @-@ blooded killer .
what you endured over the last ten years--
i can &apos;t even imagine it .
no , you can &apos;t .
but the good news is , i &apos;m back .
yeah , about that , um , why did you wanna come back here ?
well , why do you think ?
i missed my friends .
innocent or not , that guy still gives me the creeps .
i can &apos;t believe paul young is back on wisteria lane .
and he &apos;s using my shower .
jack !
you here for your 9 iron ? damn , i thought if i shaved ,
you &apos;d wouldn &apos;t recognize me and i could keep it .
actually , i need to talk to you and your wife .
hey , gaby !
in a minute !
you look a little pale , buddy . something wrong ?
i think we should wait for gaby .
jack , what &apos;s going on here , man ?
you &apos;re making me nervous .
let &apos;s just go inside , hmm ?
no ! this is impossible .
we still have the bracelet they put around juanita &apos;s ankle
in the hospital .
theresa pruitt was the nurse in charge of those bracelets ,
and although the hospital did not know this at the time ,
she had a drinking problem .
and eight years later , you &apos;re telling me this .
i &apos;ve spent eight years loving someone else &apos;s daughter !
again , i wanna stress that the hospital
only be latedly became--
jack , i swear to god , if you go lawyer on me ,
i will put your head through a wall !
so where is our ...
biologi--god , i don &apos;t even know what to call her .
we haven &apos;t been able to track the family down yet .
then we &apos;re not telling gaby ,
not till you find this other girl .
carlos , i have a legal responsibility here .
she has to be told .
fine ! i &apos;ll do it .
but i don &apos;t know how .
this is going to destroy her .
nope . i was wrong . preston ,
switch back with parker .
why are we doing this ?
when renee pulls up to this house ,
she is gonna see the one thing i can show off--
my beautiful , beautiful family .
what is that , a pimple ? get in the back !
honey , don &apos;t you think you &apos;re getting a little carried away ?
tom , that woman lives in a penthouse .
we had to give up meat so we could buy a laptop .
let me have this .
is that her ?
of course it is .
okay , everybody , smile for mom
and her strange and twisted friendship .
i &apos;m back , rudolfo .
please tell signor cipriani i always stay in that suite
when i visit venice , and if it &apos;s not available ,
i &apos;ll be very unhappy .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me , there &apos;s someone more important
i need to speak with .
hey , jose .
thanks for holding . look , i can &apos;t do thursday .
so--
jose , she &apos;ll call you back .
lynette , you haven &apos;t changed .
neither have you .
hi , sweetie .
oh , no , please tell me you didn &apos;t dum tom
for this handsome , young trophy husband .
it &apos;s me , renee .
i mean , i do work out , like , 3 times a week ,
so maybe that &apos;s what you &apos;re--
oh , okay .
are these your kids ?
yeah .
yes , and here
is our latest addition .
oh , she &apos;s precious .
look at you all , what a perfect little suburban picture .
well , you know , i &apos;ve been blessed .
very blessed .
i &apos;m sorry i gotta run , renee , but i &apos;m late for work .
work ? and i thought you wore that sexy tie just for me .
you like it ?
they--they say that bolder colors are coming back ,
so i thought i &apos;d ... okay .
bye .
bye .
love you .
oh , i gotta say , lynette ,
this place is adorable .
it &apos;s so ... cozy and intimate and ...
pay attention , kids .
you &apos;re learning a lot of new words for &quot; small . &quot;
oh , that &apos;s not what i meant .
i hate banging around my lonely old barn of a house .
sometimes weeks go by without me
running into a servant .
i &apos;m sure you see them on whipping day .
lynette , why so mean ?
i worked on these compliments all the way from the airport .
drive slower next time .
mom .
it &apos;s all right . we &apos;re just old friends reconnecting .
and i &apos;m being sincere . this is the way to go--
stripped down to the bare essentials .
you know , more people should live like this .
most peopledo live like this .
when you &apos;re flying in your private jet ,
you look down and go , wow , they look like ants down there ,
we &apos;re the ants .
so you have a private jet ?
well , it &apos;s not just ours . we share it with the team .
wait . so you get to hang out with the yankees ?
that &apos;s awesome .
how is doug , by the way ?
oh , he &apos;s fine , but all that stuff--
the team , the jet , the money ,
it &apos;s like a fantasy world .
this is what i yearn for . this is real .
this is ... sticky .
so you &apos;re staying in a really fancy hotel ?
well , i came straight from the airport ,
so i haven &apos;t booked a hotel yet .
oh , why don &apos;t you stay with us ?
oh , i &apos;m sure renee wouldn &apos;t want--
i would love to
are you sure ?
&apos;cause , you know , five kids , it gets stickier .
oh , i don &apos;t mind .
it &apos;d be fun .
i &apos;ve got a lot of catching up to do with my old , old friend .
by the way , i have a doctor who can get rid
of one of those &quot; olds . &quot;
all right . well , i guess i can set you up
on the sleeper sofa .
sleeper sofa ? ooh . look at me .
i &apos;m one of the ants .
hi . you own the building , right ?
i &apos;m susan delfino .
my husband mike and i are in 1b .
jiggle the handle . the toilet &apos;s fine .
oh , no , no , no .
i &apos;m just dropping off the security deposit .
sorry it &apos;s late . we &apos;ve been having some money problems .
have you ?
well , i &apos;m maxine .
come on in . i &apos;ll make you some tea .
thanks .
come on .
that is such a shame about mike &apos;s business .
and here you are , with no skills ,
trying to make ends meet .
mm . oh , i have skills .
i make my own jewelry . i made this .
can you believe it ?
i really can &apos;t .
you know , i remember when my husband sidney passed away .
his illness took every dime we had .
and i didn &apos;t know what i was gonna do .
well , it looks like you did okay .
i mean , you own the building .
yeah , well , that &apos;s because i stopped pouting .
i got off my tuchis , and i started my own business .
and now i &apos;m able to help other struggling women .
you know , they set their own hours .
they work from their own homes .
and oh , yoy , yoy , the money .
that sounds like a dream job .
i &apos;ll bet you &apos;d be real good at it .
let me show you .
are there phones involved ?
i &apos;ve been told i have an excellent phone voice .
uh , &quot; hello . can i interest you in a ... &quot;
oh , my god .
it &apos;s my web site !
va @-@ va @-@ va @-@ broom.com.
i got a 10 @-@ unit mac pro server farm
and a 1.5 @-@ meg t1 line .
you run a porn site ?
you &apos;re trying to lure me into pornography ?
oh , my god ! did you slip something into my tea ?
honey , relax .
this is strictly p.g.--
women doing housework in lingerie ,
no nudity , no sex .
so ?
what do you say ?
what do i say ?
i say ... shame !
shame on you !
these are nice , respectable girls
just like you .
deirdre &apos;s going to night school to become a nurse ,
and martha &apos;s trying to start over after a divorce .
don &apos;t they worry about people they know seeing them ?
most of our clients are overseas--
you know , europe , asia .
so if you go to kuala lumpur , wear a hat .
come on .
you said you had money problems .
here &apos;s what martha makes in a week .
unto martha for selling her dignity
to the highest bidder .
i promise , you won &apos;t do anything
i wouldn &apos;t let my own daughter do !
look for yourself ! she &apos;s on camera three !
what are you looking at ?
just some family photos .
that &apos;s you , the day you were born .
daddy ? who &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s your grandma .
i wish i had met her .
you would &apos;ve loved her .
do you think about her a lot ?
every day .
she was the light of my life ,
and that &apos;s why we named you after her ,
because i could not imagine a world
without a juanita solis in it .
do you want me to tuck her in ?
no , i &apos;ll do it . come on .
amy and i want to go to the mall tomorrow .
oh , sorry , hon . i have plans .
i could ride my bike .
by yourself ? i don &apos;t think so .
why not ?
you &apos;re too young . that &apos;s why not .
you &apos;re mean .
well , sometimes i have to be mean
&apos;cause it &apos;s my job to protect you .
what if you got hit by a bus ?
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
well , i can &apos;t take that chance .
you are my whole world .
if something happened to you , it would ruin my life .
you understand that ?
that &apos;s the last of it .
i &apos;ll put these books in the car .
pleasure meeting you , bree .
nice of your physical therapist to help with the move .
so are you gonna be okay ?
let &apos;s see . uh , i &apos;m getting a divorce .
i lost my business , and i &apos;m sitting here
trying to remember why i quit drinking .
i &apos;ve had better mondays .
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t be .
it &apos;s for the best .
we haven &apos;t been happy for a long time .
you know what you need ?
a project .
no . that &apos;s what i always do--
distract myself with meaningless busywork
as a way of avoiding my ... emotions .
i think i need to sit quietly
and think about what i &apos;m gonna do with my life .
well , whatever you do ...
i know it &apos;ll be spectacular .
good @-@ bye , bree .
hi , bree .
i &apos;ve been thinking about our conversation last night .
i just wanted to see how you were doing .
i &apos;m fine .
in fact , i took your advice .
i found myself a project .
i &apos;m surprised you agreed to see me .
i wanted to spit in your face .
i didn &apos;t realize there &apos;d be glass .
that &apos;s right . you &apos;re not used to prison .
give yourself time .
what is it now-- two to five years ?
18 months with good behavior .
you &apos;re giving me a lot of reasons
to be extremely well behaved .
maybe i can give you a few pointers on prison life .
i &apos;ve become a bit of an expert thanks to you .
hey , here &apos;s one .
it never hurts to tip the guard does your cavity search .
listen to me , you son of a bitch .
i don &apos;t care what i have to do .
i will see you behind bars again , or dead ...
whichever is easier .
here &apos;s another pointer .
they always record the conversations ,
so be careful about threatening the man you framed .
you murdered my sister .
that &apos;s a crazy , groundless accusation .
i have to go now .
i have things to do like shopping
and walking around in the open air
without a care in the world .
you know you did it .
i did .
wow , they &apos;re all so ... big .
exactly . thank you .
you &apos;re welcome ?
oh , i knew you guys would get it ,
unlike those idiots that walked
by my card table in the park .
it &apos;s not jewelry .
it &apos;s wearable art .
so ... who wants to try these earrings ?
oh , uh , i &apos;m not sure that my delicate ears
can support something so large .
how about gaby ?
she has big , strong , latino ears .
lynette , where is this friend of yours ?
we &apos;re all dying to meet her .
come on .
i need a volunteer . lynette ?
yes ! yes !
how &apos;s it feel ?
about as good as it looks , i &apos;m guessing . i &apos;ll take &apos; em .
yes !
what are you guys getting ?
i &apos;m gonna buy this ... for bree
and her strong , protestant neck .
oh , you guys are the best .
oh , hey , here she is .
okay , susan , bree , gaby ,
this is my old college roommate , renee .
hi . it is so nice to finally meet you .
lynette has talked so much about her friend frollege .
oh , yes , you know how in school
the pretty girls always hang out together ?
well , i refused to go along with that .
renee comes off a little stuck up
when you first meet her , which is a real time @-@ saver .
sit down !
so , renee , you have to tell us .
what was lynette like in college ?
uh , absolutely fearless .
she just kept wearing those parachute pants ,
lesbian rumors be damned .
yes , renee was always the one with the fashion sense .
before i met her ,
i &apos;d never even heard of gucci or prada ...
or chlamydia .
wow , you guys play rough .
no , it &apos;s just what we do . it &apos;s fun .
i tease her about being all botulism from the nose up ...
and i tease her about being all cottage cheese
from the waist down .
so , renee , we hear that you &apos;re married to doug perry ?
the baseball player ?
no surprise there .
in our sorority ,
renee was voted most likely to marry well .
and lynette was voted most likely
to succeed .
so , bree , i hear you &apos;re an amazing cook .
hang on a second. what was that ?
what ?
that ... &quot; aw . &quot;
oh , nothing .
i just didn &apos;t wanna ... make you feel bad .
about what ?
well , it-- it &apos;s just that , uh ,
i think our college friends would be surprised
to see how you ended up .
oh , i thought they were still playing .
you know , renee ,
i have had a career and raised a family .
and that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s just that we had such high hopes for you .
not like you , spending the last 15 years
sponging off a rich guy .
hey , let &apos;s stop before somebody gets hurt .
whatever i got , i got on my own .
and what have you got ?
a blouse from the &quot; i &apos;ve stopped trying &quot; collection
and a pair of earrings your kid made at camp ?
and ... somebody got hurt .
that &apos;s great. easy shots . you got more money than me .
oh , it &apos;s not about the money .
the lynette i knew never would have settled for this .
you were adventurous .
you backpacked through croatia .
you jumped onstage at a springsteen concert .
it &apos;s just hard for me to reconcile
this suburban housewife with the girl ...
who had a threesome with two of the guys
from the rugby team .
why would she do this ?
why would she jump in a private jet
and fly all the way across the country
just to dump on my life ?
two guys , huh ?
we &apos;re not talking about that anymore .
i mean , isn &apos;t her life perfect enough ?
does she really need to score bonus points
by taking me down ?
so was it one rugby guy and then the other ,
or just sort of a @-@ a scrum ?
oh , drop it , tom .
you know , i have shielded you
from some of the wilder things that i &apos;ve done ,
like that time at the amusement park--
little story i like to call &quot; &apos; d &apos; cups on the teacups . &quot;
okay , i &apos;m dropping it now .
thank you .
why are you getting so upset ?
i mean , i thought you and renee loved to zing each other .
those weren &apos;t zings .
when she made that ... &quot; aw , &quot;
she meant it . i mean , what the hell was that ?
she doesn &apos;t get to be disappointed in my life .
well , maybe you should tell her how you feel .
yeah . you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
in fact , i am going to tell her a lot more than that .
good for you . but when you get back ,
i &apos;d like to revisit a certain request i made
on my 40th birthday , which ,
in light of recent revelations ,
seems a lot more ...
okay .
what &apos;s this ?
yellow pages .
hotel is under &quot; h . &quot;
yeah , i had a feeling i hit a nerve this afternoon .
if you find my life that pathetic ,
i &apos;m going to spare you the agony of observing it .
and by the way , taxi is under &quot; t . &quot;
lynette , i don &apos;t think your life is pathetic .
maybe not , but you clearly think
yours is a whole lot better .
so if you need me to say it ,
i &apos;ll say it. you win .
you got the fabulous clothes , the penthouse apartment ,
and the rich husband .
congratulations .
doug is leaving me .
i found out he was cheating ...
with his agent &apos;s assistant .
i confronted him , told him it was her or me ,
and he chose her .
i threw some things in a bag and took off .
i didn &apos;t have a plan .
i just needed to get out of there ,
and i couldn &apos;t think of anywhere else to go .
why didn &apos;t you tell me this ?
lynette , my life is about to fall apart .
i haven &apos;t even admitted it to myself yet .
how could i tell you ?
well , of course you can stay here as long as you want .
thanks .
and to show my appreciation ,
i would like to pay for your first face @-@ lift .
that is so generous .
although now you &apos;ve had nine ,
you probably get the next one free .
hey , carlos. what can i--
i &apos;ll make this quick . i &apos;m gonna give you two options .
option one-- i sue this hospital for--
i don &apos;t know--
$ 10 million , $ 20 million ,
and i think i &apos;ll get it. that would bankrupt us .
then you &apos;re probably gonna wanna go for option two .
which is ?
you make this whole thing go away--
shred the documents ,
call off the search for the other family ,
and never , ever let gaby find out about this .
carlos , we &apos;ve sent out letters ,
hired investigators .
i don &apos;t know if this process can be stopped .
try .
and even if it could ,
this is a hell of a thing you &apos;re taking ,
keeping this secret by yourself .
what &apos;s my choice ?
if gaby knew the truth , it would kill her .
no . i can &apos;t tell her .
i can &apos;t tell him .
are you sure ?
doesn &apos;t he deserve to know
what andrew did to his mother ?
you have to understand--
carlos is so happy right now .
our marriage is the best it &apos;s ever been .
he loves his job .
the girls are turning out so beautifully .
except for this one easily ignorable blip ...
our life is perfect .
and i won &apos;t let anything change that .
pork chops for dinner .
i know it was a bit of a splurge ,
but i made up for it-- 1 @-@ ply toilet paper .
something wrong ?
the bank turned down my loan application .
without that money , i can &apos;t hire any help .
and without help ,
it &apos;s just gonna be one dinky job after another .
we &apos;ll never get outta here like that .
okay . well , we &apos;ll scrimp and save .
i won &apos;t buy pork chops anymore . i &apos;m gonna return these .
i &apos;m thinking about taking a job in alaska .
what ?
a buddy told me about it-- six months on an oil rig .
one year at the most .
i could make triple what i can earn here .
you can probably back in the house before i &apos;m even done .
mike , that is really dangerous work .
m.j. needs you here . i need you here .
no , there &apos;s gotta be another way .
you think i wanna go ?
we don &apos;t have any good options here .
give me a month before you make a decision .
i &apos;ve just got a feeling that this jewelry thing of mine
could start pulling in some serious money .
sweetheart , you &apos;re talented ,
but &quot; serious money &quot; ?
you &apos;d be surprised what some people are willing to pay for .
no nudity , no sex , and no one can ever know .
i am so glad i can help .
so what did you remove this with--a puma ?
i was anxious to get rid of it .
my soon @-@ to @-@ be ex @-@ husband
picked out most of the decor ,
and i realized i needed a fresh start .
you know , wallpaper &apos;s nice , but it &apos;s a little ...
well , it &apos;s your house , not mine .
no , keith , please .
i hired you . i wanna hear your ideas .
i would suggest that you paint this room
something , you know , bold .
oh , i like the sound of that .
perhaps a nice , deep beige .
or ... bolder .
i mean , with the size of this room and the light ,
you could go ...
scarlet red .
please don &apos;t take this the wrong way ,
but i &apos;m going to be serving dinner in this room ,
not sailors .
could you excuse me for a moment ? i &apos;ll be right back .
here you go--
the final division of assets .
just need a jill hancock from you ,
and we &apos;re all set .
uh , before i forget ,
andrew &apos;s having a dinner party on the 10th ,
and he &apos;d love for you to come .
even though we &apos;re separating ,
we both want you to feel that you &apos;re still part of the family .
i &apos;m touched . thank you , bree .
orson , don &apos;t we have plans ?
the wine tasting ?
why don &apos;t you wait for me in the van ?
as you may have gleaned ,
my relationship with judy has ... evolved .
was it evolving while you and i were still together ?
no , no , of course not .
apparently , she had feelings for me ,
but she waited a respectable amount of time
before expressing them .
it &apos;s been a week .
you know the expression &quot; the ink &apos;s not even dry &quot; ?
it &apos;s not dry !
we have separated , bree .
and the two of us spent so many years being miserable .
i just think at our age ,
we can &apos;t let an opportunity for happiness pass us by .
forget the red .
i &apos;ve got something here called moonstruck yellow
that will kick your dining room &apos;s ass .
come on . i promise . you &apos;ll love this .
with your red hair , you will look
so hot in this room .
but , you know , whatever you want .
clearly you have other options .
maybe i do .
there &apos;s my favorite realtor . thanks for coming over .
how are ya ?
bit of a pariah , thanks to you .
don &apos;t tell me the neighbors are blaminyou for my return .
of course they are .
you know , when you told me that you didn &apos;t have any pets ,
you could have mentioned
it &apos;s because they don &apos;t allow them in prison .
now , now , be nice .
i &apos;m about to throw more business your way .
oh ?
i hear that my old house is back on the market .
i &apos;d like to buy it .
because of all the wonderful memories ?
just find out what they &apos;re asking .
okay , but you just signed a one @-@ year lease on this place ,
and you &apos;re buying a house across the street .
doesn &apos;t sound like a very good plan .
oh , believe me . i &apos;ve had ten years to work on this plan .
it &apos;s a good one .
bad news travels quickly ,
and when it arrives , we have to find a way to deal with it .
if our husbands tell us they &apos;ve moved on ...
we look for projects to distract us .
if the bills start to stack up ...
we find ways to earn extra cash .
if we &apos;re told a secret too terrible to share ...
we learn to keep it to ourselves .
but we must remember the bad news that &apos;s delivered
can sometimes be good news ...
in disguise .
that the guy you were talkin &apos; about ?
the one that killed your sister ?
it certainly is .
he looks like a killer . it &apos;s a shame they let him out .
as it turns out , it &apos;s all for the best .
paul can now receive the punishment he &apos;s entitled to .
what do you mean ?
just between us girls ,
paul young will be dead within six months .
how you gonna make that happen ?
you &apos;re in here at least two years .
true , but you see ,
paul young doesn &apos;t have a friends on that street .
