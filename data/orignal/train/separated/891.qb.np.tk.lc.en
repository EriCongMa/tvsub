back in the 80 &apos;s , before you could buy music with the click of a button ,
you &apos;d go to an actual record store
to purchase your favorite cassette tapes .
we thought we &apos;d reached the height of musical technology ,
until this happened .
behold , the cd --
a disc surrounded by a case
within another , larger rectangular case .
it &apos;s a compact disc .
oh , it &apos;s so beautiful .
i can &apos;t wait to go home and throw away
my hundreds of useless cassettes .
we need to have this right now !
you ! sam goody !
that &apos;s the name of the store . my name &apos;s jared .
how much for a cd player ?
$ 900 -- plus tax .
we will never own one .
we will when i convince dad to buy us one .
and how do you plan on doing that ?
a little something i like to call &quot; barry goldberg charm . &quot;
buy us a cd player !
i don &apos;t know what that is ,
but i &apos;m sure it &apos;s unnecessary and expensive .
it &apos;s the opposite of that .
engineers in lab coats have created a musical experience
that is so crisp and clean ,
it can literally improve your hearing .
no more music crap .
first , i bought you records , then 8 @-@ tracks , then cassettes .
where does it end ?
here !
the technology ends here .
cds are so good that scientists have given up and quit .
it &apos;s all over the paper . they &apos;re unemployed .
let me take a swing at it , pal .
dad , this is crazy @-@ important . music means everything to me .
it &apos;s , like , my thing .
it &apos;s my thing , too .
big tasty needs a cd player to keep up with the changing times .
see , that &apos;s the problem with you kids --
everything is your thing !
last month , i had to buy you tap shoes
&apos;cause dance was your thing .
and before that , fashion and skiing and horseback riding .
why do i get punished
&apos;cause she can &apos;t find something she &apos;s good at ?
oh , don &apos;t get me started with you ,
with your hockey and karate and break @-@ dancing .
dad , this is different .
and so are the last hundred things . it &apos;s not happening .
oh , it &apos;ll happen when i go upstairs
and write the greatest song in the history of the world .
with a vicious rap interlude .
and when you hear my angelic song ,
you will ... weep and clap and be so moved
that you will demand that we have a cd player .
i &apos;m not an unreasonable man .
if you two write
the greatest song in the history of the world ,
i will indeed buy you a cd player .
great !
then i will ...
go write the greatest song in the world .
with a vicious rap interlude .
good luck to you .
it was april 2 , 1980 @-@ something -- my birthday .
and that meant one thing --
desperately avoiding an onslaught of love from my mom .
birthday boy sighting !
it &apos;s my little love muffin &apos;s birthday .
and how do i know ?
because i grew your body in my body .
will you stop bringing that up ? we all know where i came from .
we are gonna go all out and party hearty .
yeah , about that --
i was thinking this year , i just hit the arcade with chad .
oh , poop . it &apos;s your big day .
we &apos;ve got to do something special .
mom , i know i &apos;ve said this
every day for the past two weeks ,
but i &apos;m in middle school now ,
and birthday parties are not cool .
fine , moody judy .
you can celebrate with no family and no fanfare .
but before you go , can i at least give you my present ?
it &apos;s down in the basement .
i think you &apos;re really gonna love it .
surprise !
and there it was -- my mom went behind my back
and invited my friends over for a stupid little @-@ kid party !
what have you done ?
all my friends are gonna think this is super @-@ lame .
yo , mrs . g , digging this &quot; o &quot; dip .
and why did you invite garry ball ?
he &apos;s super @-@ cool and gets away with murder
&apos;cause his dad &apos;s the principal !
oh , nonsense .
okay , kiddos ,
i &apos;ve scored everything you &apos;re gonna need
to have a raging slumber party --
jolt cola , pixy stix , mad libs , ouija board ,
and a pen to draw on the first dorkus who falls asleep .
i &apos;m looking at you , dave sirota .
burn !
i am a funny mom .
jam on .
my friends were gonna give me hell .
this was the epitome of uncool !
dude , this is gonna be so rad .
really ?
you guys are actually stoked about a slumber party ?
slumr party ? i thought this was a sleepover .
what &apos;s the difference ?
ha ! stupid chad kremp doesn &apos;t know the difference .
someone should tell him in great detail
so he knows what to expect tonight .
slumber parties are for little kids with sleeping bags .
but at a sleepover , we break all the rules .
um , chad is wondering if you could give
some specific rules we &apos;re gonna break .
whatever we want , man .
we can dip some &apos; chaw , make some prank calls ,
light off some fireworks , sneak out , make out .
is your sister home ?
chad &apos;s now wondering if part of the sleepover
is making your host feel uncomfortable .
nothing could prepare me for what my friends had in store .
dave kim brought his great @-@ grandfather &apos;s pipe .
sirota topped that with his brother &apos;s throwing stars .
but both paled in comparison to what garry ball offered up --
a real , grown @-@ up , ice @-@ cold beer !
served warm .
when i was trying to keep my cool ,
barry and erica were trying to write
the greatest song known to man .
okay , here we go -- greatest song of all time .
let &apos;s do this .
* music *
* singin &apos; music with my mouth *
that &apos;s it ! we did it !
yeah , i think we should keep working .
let &apos;s break this down .
what are the greatest songs about ?
well , obviously you got to start with a guy in a mill .
no .
and he &apos;s working his fingers to the bone
on some type of metal thing where sparks fly .
and he &apos;s dead @-@ broke , definitely lives in jersey .
why jersey ?
t @-@ that &apos;s the heartland , where all the real people live --
and die , &apos; cause millwork is dangerous .
forget the mills . we need to think bigger .
the greatest songs are always about love ,
about loss and yearning ,
about driving all night and islands in the stream
and seconding that emotion .
love is a battlefield .
exactly !
it &apos;s a battlefield ,
and you got to crush your enemies like a ninja --
a ninja of love !
love ninja !
that &apos;s it ! we did it ! we changed the world !
* she &apos;s a love ninja *
* love ninja *
yes , yes .
now sing something
about how she snaps necks and takes no prisoners .
it &apos;s a love song . she can &apos;t be snapping necks .
but she can be breaking hearts .
or breaking the neck of the heart .
oh , my god ! oh , my god ! that &apos;s so good !
an hour later , their musical opus was ready .
okay , pops , i need to make sure
that this is the greatest song of all time before dad hears it .
just give me your honest opinion .
* well , it was just outside of jersey *
* but not in the actual state *
* donny drilled metal things in a mill *
* danger was his fate *
* but his desire burned like fire *
* for a stealthy gal named kate *
* she &apos;s a love ninja , a love ninja *
* love ninja , snapped the neck of my heart *
* she &apos;s a love ninja , nunchucked my life apart *
* roundhouse , crane kick , elbow chop *
* ninja stole my heart , and she wouldn &apos;t stop *
* bo staff , blow dart , samurai blade *
* ninja went off like a ninja grenade *
girl , you threw a smoke bomb ,
vanished with a spark
* she &apos;s more deadly than a robot shark *
* a robot shark , how sweet would that be ? *
* mechanical beast swimming out to sea *
* love ninja , a love ninja *
blah , blah , blah .
yeah , it &apos;s just a taste , but ... what do you think ?
you two are my grandkids , and i love you ,
so if you want me to say this confusing fakakta song
about ninjas and robot sharks is actually good ,
i &apos;ll say it .
great ! do that !
i &apos;m sorry . i thought i could , but i can &apos;t .
damn it !
how else are we supposed to convince dad
that music is our thing ?
can &apos;t be done .
you &apos;re dealing with a man
who has no interest in music whatsoever .
everyone likes music .
oh , my god . i think pops is right .
how can he actually not like music ?
some dads just don &apos;t .
it &apos;s more common than you think .
well , that &apos;s perfect .
dad &apos;s a blank slate .
we don &apos;t have to write the world &apos;s greatest song .
we can just sing someone else &apos;s and say that it &apos;s ours .
that &apos;s genius !
that &apos;s not genius .
genius is coming up with an idea that makes sense .
your idea &apos;s terrible .
barry , come on . we got to go steal a song .
the beer smells kind of funky .
that &apos;s the point , dude .
this is craft brew -- fancy kind , trust me .
shouldn &apos;t it say , like , &quot; schlitz &quot; or something ?
nah , it &apos;s better than real beer .
my dad brews it in the downstairs bathtub .
dave kim , you &apos;re up .
this was it .
sure , we were nervous , but it was my birthday ,
and we would become men together .
well , everyone but me .
sirota immediately booted .
cool guy garry ball wasn &apos;t far behind .
chad was next .
and finally , dave kim , who had no options left .
that first sip came up as quickly as it went down .
not the washing machine !
stop judging me !
there was no way it could get worse .
squishy !
until it did .
look who i found moseying around the balloon corral .
it &apos;s cowboy josh , and today , he &apos;s gonna --
ohhh ! sweet creamed corn !
it was either think fast
or be grounded for the rest of my life .
i think it was the &quot; o &quot; dip .
and ... grounded it was .
i &apos;d like to thank you all for coming to this meeting
on such short notice .
let me begin by saying
i &apos;m not here today as principal ball .
i &apos;m just earl , concerned parent .
understood , earl .
i know you all have some questions
about the messy incident that took place
in our basement this weekend ,
but let &apos;s agree to have an open dialogue ,
free of any finger @-@ pointing , okay ?
that said , i blame you and you and you
and -- back up -- you .
okay , okay . let &apos;s calm down .
our kids only got into one of my unfermented batches ,
so , luckily , they just drank pure mold .
oh , no !
you will not lump adam in with your band of beer sippers .
he didn &apos;t get sick , which means he never drank the mold .
oh , please -- i &apos;ve seen adam doing horseplay
when i have specifically requested no horseplay .
he &apos;s no angel .
oh , he is an angel .
he could literally sprout wings and take flight at any moment !
i know dave kim better than anyone ,
and there &apos;s no way he &apos;d ever drink a beer --
unless he was peer @-@ pressured .
don &apos;t you point at me .
from what i heard ,
your little smokey the bear brought a pipe .
my son hurt no one
and looked like an elegant ship captain .
and with that ,
the open dialogue free of finger @-@ pointing
broke down into a profanity @-@ laced free @-@ for @-@ all .
this absurdity went on for another 25 minutes .
indoor voices , everybody !
and absolutely nothing was accomplished .
now , that &apos;s enough !
it seems there is only one thing we can all agree on ,
and that is that the goldberg sleepover
was the last time our boys ever hang out .
agreed .
fine with me .
wait -- the last time ?
what does that mean ?
it means we separate our little drinking buddies
before they end up as winos on the street .
while my social life was being dismantled ,
erica and barry &apos;s plan was coming together --
steal a song and pass it off as their own .
* now that it &apos;s done *
* i hope you don &apos;t mind , i hope you don &apos;t mind *
* that i put down in words *
* words , words , adjectives and verbs *
* how wonderful life is *
* now you &apos;re in the world *
that was incredible .
yeah ?
you really like our -- our original song
that we wrote together ?
i really do .
i think we proved
that we deserve a cd player .
you mean elton john deserves a cd player .
he knows the song .
he knows the song .
you know the song ?
of course i know the song !
but you don &apos;t listen to music .
but i live on earth !
you do realize when elton john says
&quot; you can tell everybody that this is your song , &quot;
it &apos;s not actually your song , right ?
okay , so maybe we lied ,
but we did write an original masterpiece .
erica , quick -- play &quot; love ninja . &quot;
please -- no &quot; love ninja . &quot;
let &apos;s make this simple .
you &apos;re not getting a cd player .
i hereby declare this a cassette house .
so it is written .
so it is done .
you were right , pops . he &apos;ll never understand .
the man just doesn &apos;t get music .
did you ever stop to think why ?
when your dad was your age , there was no music .
&apos;cause it wasn &apos;t invented yet .
no . there was no time for music .
back then , his father gave him nothing .
your dad &apos;s only &quot; thing &quot; was raising his little brother .
maybe you should think about what he sacrificed
and give him something back .
while barry and erica were realizing the error of their ways ,
my friends and i were still being punished for ours .
hey , guys .
hello .
hi .
yo .
how was everyone &apos;s day ?
don &apos;t put us in this position , dude .
you know we can &apos;t exchange pleasantries .
well , i miss you guys .
even you , dave kim .
who &apos;s that talking ? what &apos;s happening ?
you know what ? i &apos;m not ready to lose you dudes .
i don &apos;t care what my mom thinks .
she thinks we &apos;re a band of alcoholic roughnecks
and you &apos;re a snuggly , little angel .
then it &apos;s time i show her this angel has fallen .
what angel ? what &apos;s happening ?
it was &quot; go &quot; time .
we need to talk , lady !
okay , well , before you start stomping your little buster browns ,
you need to know
i &apos;m not the one who wanted you guys to stop hanging out .
oh , please . thanks to you , i lost all of my friends .
well , maybe it was for the best .
i mean , those bad apples did ruin my angel &apos;s slumber party .
they &apos;re not bad apples . and i &apos;m no angel .
of course you are . you didn &apos;t drink the mold .
well , i was going to drink the mold .
but you drank no mold .
i &apos;ll drink the mold right now .
drink the mold , i would , and nothing would stop me .
don &apos;t you dare drink that mold !
consider this mold dranken .
cuddle bear , no .
you drank the mold !
but i &apos;m glad i did .
because now you see me for what i am --
a regular kid ...
who needs a bathroom .
while i could no longer ignore the nausea ,
erica and barry listened to pops
and decided to give back to my dad .
hey ! there &apos;s the merman !
shedding those slacks like a champ .
what the hell is that ?
that is your new cd player .
it &apos;s a marantz ta @-@ 100
with tuner , equalizer , and monster speakers .
this is for me ?
sure is .
yep .
the thing you &apos;ve been desperate to get ?
absolutely .
that is correct .
was this your idea ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t even know anymore .
actually , pops reminded us about
how much you had to sacrifice as a kid .
so we did the same .
and we traded in all the stuff you ever bought us
for this one cd player .
now we , too , know what it &apos;s like to suffer .
i sacrificed my unused stilts and abandoned aquarium ,
just like you sacrificed your whole childhood
to raise your brother .
we are the same .
of course , if you want to let us listen to it from time to time ,
we won &apos;t stop you .
but that &apos;s up to you , &apos; cause this is yours .
yeah !
unless you &apos;re not home .
then it &apos;s ours .
so , what we have here is a self @-@ gift .
a what , now ?
a self @-@ gift .
you bought it for you but gave it to me .
this was not a self @-@ gift !
fine ! if it really is mine , then you can &apos;t use it ever .
no way !
you can &apos;t do that !
what about sharing ? we need to learn life lessons .
oh , that &apos;s what this is . it &apos;s mine -- all of it .
oh , what you got playing here ?
that &apos;s my rare , imported public enemy cd !
you can &apos;t touch that . you hate rap .
not anymore -- &apos; cause it &apos;s mine .
what ? !
oh , boy . that &apos;s aggressive .
those guys are angry !
i don &apos;t know what about , and i don &apos;t care .
but i &apos;m on board !
&quot; fight the power &quot; is my jam , not yours !
well , now i fight the power !
you can &apos;t fight the power . you are the power .
no . you are .
and ... chuck d agrees .
don &apos;t you dare say chuck d &apos;s name !
oh , i &apos;ll say it .
and i &apos;ll say &quot; professor griff &quot;
and &quot; terminator ten &quot; and &quot; flavor flav . &quot;
they all agree that you &apos;re the power worth fighting !
you have no idea how much that hurts my feelings !
i am not as emotional about chuck d ,
but i am really upset about the stereo .
while my dad had intended to teach erica and barry a lesson ,
all he did was turn himself into a real public enemy .
it had been one day since i drank the mold ,
and my mom had finally accepted that i was no better
than the other beer @-@ sippers .
hello , everyone . thanks for coming .
uh , last time we were all here ,
there was a lot of finger @-@ pointing --
mostly by me .
but i just want to say
that earl &apos;s idea to keep our kids apart
is the stupidest thing he &apos;s done
since &quot; mandatory shorts day &quot; last june .
hey , there was a heat wave .
point is , i think our kids should be friends again .
and you &apos;re not worried that our band
of crazed suburban hooligans will corrupt your little angel ?
look , i realize they &apos;re not monsters .
they &apos;re just growing up .
which means they &apos;re still sweet and cute and kind .
but now they &apos;re also little sticks
that need to be watched at every turn .
why did they have to turn slumber parties into sleepovers ?
they were so adorable snuggled up in those sleeping bags .
i don &apos;t even punish garry to his room anymore .
my wife and i -- we just lock ourselves in the bedroom ,
let him have the run of the house .
growing up is so hard on them , you know ?
they need each other .
they really do .
but the truth is , we need each other , too .
we can &apos;t do this alone .
so from here on out , we &apos;re a united front .
what do you say ?
that day , our parents finally found some real common ground .
back at home , my mom decided to make things right
with her grounded son .
hey , schmoo . how you feeling ?
i &apos;m regretting my decision to drink the mold .
well , when you feel better , um ..
these are for the arcade .
thought you could have the birthday you actually wanted .
thanks , but there &apos;s no point in playing air hockey alone .
about that ...
i had a chat with the other parents .
the ban &apos;s been lifted .
but i thought those guys were bad apples .
well , you know what they say about bad apples .
they make the best pies .
that wasn &apos;t a real saying ,
but it was my mom &apos;s way of admitting
that i was gonna grow up -- whether she liked it or not .
wait .
i know i &apos;m in middle school and all ,
but could you stay and rub my upset tummy ?
you got it , angel .
* and you can tell everybody *
* this is your song *
* it may be quite simple , but now that it &apos;s done *
truth is , none of us were perfect angels .
but our parents weren &apos;t perfect , either .
that &apos;s the thing about growing up --
after a while , it &apos;s better to accept the way things are
than to stay hung up on the way things used to be .
which is why my dad decided
to give a little something back to erica and barry .
i know this was a gift for me ,
but i think you &apos;ll get more use out of it .
really ? but i thought that you said --
look , i know i got a little bit crazy .
sometimes it &apos;s hard because the two of you --
your lives are so different than the way mine was .
but truthfully , that &apos;s the way i want it .
now go ahead -- enjoy your music .
i know it &apos;s your thing .
all it took was a cd player
for my dad to stop punishing his kids for his past
and start supporting their dreams for the future .
as for my mom , she got the support she always needed
from her new group of friends .
once a month , our parents got together for a homemade stout
and to talk about the hell we put them through .
and me -- i not only got my old friends back ,
but i gained a new one .
sure , garry was cool and i was far from it ,
but together , we cooked up some memories
that would last a lifetime .
welcome to &quot; the swedish chef cooking hour . &quot;
bork , bork .
first is -- is monkey soup .
monkey -- monkey soup .
no monkey !
no monkey soup today !
no monkey soup today !
dude ! you got a discman ? !
that &apos;s unbelievable !
i know ! look .
it &apos;s so small and sleek
and fits in the palm of both hands together .
so , how is it ?
uh , it has some kinks .
it skips a lot if you run with it .
or walk . or breathe heavily .
negative thoughts also affect it .
that &apos;s nuts . you &apos;re just listening wrong .
let me try .
oh , wow . yeah , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s skipping .
just -- just hold it steady . - i can &apos;t .
god , it just keeps skipping .
try pressing it to your body .
stop skipping while i barely move !
it &apos;ll stabilize .
oh ! i got it ! ha !
the trick is to fully extend your arm
and hold it up as high as you can .
yeah , this is awesome !
oh . no . no , it &apos;s skipping again .
