aloha , football fans ,
and welcome the grudge match .
the inter @-@ island rivalry everyone &apos;s been waiting for :
the kukui kings versus the p @-@ boy &apos;s scorpion .
oh ! how &apos;d you miss that facemask call , ref ? !
he only tried to gouge the kid &apos;s eyes out ! you suck !
i &apos;m glad she &apos;s on our team .
no , she &apos;s just getting warmed up .
sorry we &apos;re late .
nice hands , brah .
hey , gracie . i &apos;m steve .
it &apos;s great to meet you finally .
your dad , he talks about you all the time .
talks about you a lot , too .
really ?
we , uh , we commiserate . it &apos;s a father @-@ daughter thing .
hi , i &apos;m kono .
hello .
and i &apos;m uncle chin .
are you a football player ?
i used to be .
i used to play quarterback for that red team .
he was a legend , too , till , uh , till i came along
and shattered all his records .
that &apos;s a really pretty tennis outfit .
yeah , i had to pick her up today at a country club .
step @-@ stan decided that she should
start taking tennis lessons .
what &apos;s wrong with tennis , danny ?
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s wrong with tennis .
it can be played on a table ,
which makes it an activity , not a sport .
you throw the ball , i catch the ball , that is a sport .
it &apos;s my duty as a father
to teach my daughter the difference .
dad , i can still hear you .
well , you &apos;re not supposed to be listening to me , huh ?
you &apos;re supposed to be paying attention ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s football . it &apos;s a sport .
dad , i &apos;m hungry .
how can you be hungry ? we ate an hour ago .
we didn &apos;t eat nachos an hour ago .
what was i thinking about ? of course , we didn &apos;t .
come on . let &apos;s go .
hey , get me some .
bye .
i mean , is this place great or what , huh ?
it &apos;s a real ballpark here .
remember yankee stadium ?
popcorn , we got corndogs .
they don &apos;t have that kind of food at country clubs , do they ?
well , they have hot dogs ,
but they don &apos;t come on a stick .
no stick ? defeats the whole purpose .
come here . come on .
excuse me . i &apos;m a police officer .
yes ?
we may have a situation here .
this is my daughter grace . i need you
to take her and your daughter into the bathroom
and wait there until i get back , all right ?
okay .
thank you . hey , come on , kid , listen to me .
this nice lady &apos;s gonna watch you for a little bit .
i want you to go with her , okay ?
daddy ...
hey , i &apos;m just gonna go make sure
there &apos;s no bad guys , that &apos;s all-- all right ?
i &apos;ll be right back . come here . i love you . go on .
okay , come on .
where are my nachos ?
hey , i &apos;m right in front of you .
got two guys headed to the field , strapped .
i think something &apos;s about to go down .
we got trouble .
kono , call hpd for backup .
hey , all right . come on , junior .
gun ! gun !
put it down ! put it down !
get out of the way !
black shirt ! runner !
i got him .
hands behind your head right now-- right now !
got him . got him . go ! go get grace !
all right , everybody , keep the peace and stay calm .
grace !
grace !
daddy ! daddy !
come here , baby .
come here .
you okay , huh ?
you okay ?
freeze !
put your hands where i can see &apos; em !
turn around slowly .
sid ?
there &apos;s no id on this victim .
see if any of the other witnesses know him .
you &apos;re a hell of a quarterback . what &apos;s your name ?
junior satelli .
junior , all right , you got lucky today .
it &apos;s just a scratch .
hey , boss , over here .
you &apos;re gonna be all right , kid .
excuse me .
this is one of the shooters .
do you recognize the art ?
it &apos;s a 14k tattoo . this guy &apos;s a triad enforcer .
the other vic is samoan .
these guys are from two different gangs .
so what are we looking at here , a gang war ?
the triads and samoans have coexisted on this island
for as long as i can remember . they never brought
their wars into the public ,
especially in front of their families .
you guys okay ?
yeah , okay . you ?
yeah . i lost my runner in the parking lot .
that is the most ridiculous thing
i have ever heard in my life .
violence follows me ? i mean ,
how do you even come up with something like that ?
no , what happened here has nothing to do with my job .
in fact , it is just the opposite , okay ?
she is safe because i am a cop .
huh ? you know , i can &apos;t ,
i can &apos;t even do this right now .
she &apos;ll be there in five minutes .
an officer &apos;s bringing her home .
yeah . good @-@ bye .
can &apos;t wait to meet your ex .
yeah , the two of you can plan my demise .
so what do we got ?
six friendlies wounded , two hostiles dead .
think it was a gang shooting .
triads and samoans .
well , if this is a gang war ,
the problem is there &apos;s only gonna be one winner .
yeah . and the losers : whoever gets in the way .
what do you want ?
where &apos;s sid ?
i haven &apos;t seen him in months .
she has your eyes .
i gotta go .
all right .
well , if you see him , tell him i &apos;m looking for him .
so i got an id on the target of our gang shooting .
his name is manu sapolu .
hpd says he &apos;s a high @-@ ranking lieutenant .
if this is a gang war , sapolu might be retaliation .
crime reduction unit says the samoans are responsible
for murders of at least seven triads in the last six months .
that &apos;s why this was so public .
the triads are sending a message they &apos;re not gonna sit back
and get taken out one @-@ by @-@ one .
hey , guys ! i got something .
been going through the cameras left behind ,
trying to id the shooters--
this is what i saw .
wait , wait , wait . go back . rewind that .
check it out .
that &apos;s junior satelli , the quarterback .
so wait a minute-- everyone &apos;s running
away from the gunshots , but this kid junior &apos;s
moving right towards it .
thought you might find that interesting ,
so i asked around .
junior &apos;s uncle is manu sapolu ,
our dead samoan .
yeah , so he &apos;s probably in the gang .
and knows who the shooters are .
emts released him .
i saw him heading to the locker room .
come on .
you know , when i was a kid ,
this island seemed like the safest place on earth .
that &apos;s the great thing about being a kid ,
you don &apos;t know any better .
you could leave your door unlocked , no one would bother you .
if people had a beef , they &apos;d settle it
with their fists , not with guns .
back home , you win a fistfight ,
you go home and you lock the doors twice ,
&apos;cause you know somebody &apos;s coming back with a gun .
yeah .
i think maybe hawaii &apos;s just catching up to the times .
maybe .
hey , there &apos;s junior .
what do you think &apos;s in the bag ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ll give you three @-@ to @-@ one
it ain &apos;t his lunch .
hey ! junior .
how &apos;s it ?
let &apos;s take a look at your lunch .
hey , hey , i didn &apos;t do nothing .
you didn &apos;t do anything yet .
we know manu sapolu &apos;s your uncle .
what do you got ?
look at that .
what are you thinking , huh ?
what are you thinking about ?
it &apos;s all my fault , man .
i asked him to come watch me play today ,
and if i wouldn &apos;t have done it , he ...
you were starting quarterback
in the biggest game of the year .
you think your uncle was gonna stay away ?
you lost someone you love today , i get that .
but putting another body in the morgue ,
you think that &apos;s gonna make you feel better ?
junior , tell us where we can find the men who shot your uncle .
i promise you we &apos;ll take &apos; em off the street .
international marketplace .
the guys that did this ...
they just started using the store trains to front their meth business .
all right .
if i see you anywhere but a football field ,
i will arrest you .
you understand ?
yes .
go home .
excuse me ?
go .
hold on , hold on . wait , whoa @-@ whoa @-@ whoa .
go .
whoa @-@ whoa @-@ whoa !
okay , let me ask you a question .
what the hell is the matter with you , huh ? !
he &apos;s just a kid .
no , he &apos;s not just a kid .
he &apos;s a kid with a gun , okay ?
what , did you want me ?
to book him , danno ?
you think that &apos;s funny ?
let me break it down for you , okay ?
kids with guns kill innocent people and cops !
right .
all right , now , that kid ,
maybe he &apos;s going to finish a math assignment ,
but more likely he &apos;s looking for another gun
so he can shoot someone !
why ? &apos; cause you conveniently just decided
to forget about the law !
he &apos;s angry because somebody came along
and killed a member of his family today .
and he feels like if he doesn &apos;t do something about it ,
nobody will .
so let &apos;s prove him wrong .
come on , we got a job to do .
there &apos;s something wrong with you , you know that , right ?
so you like to kill people on football fields , huh ?
you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of manu sapolu .
that &apos;s because these girls are like , &quot; give us some money . &quot;
go ahead , take the girls back to the house .
what the hell are you doing here ?
there &apos;s a tape of the game .
it &apos;s only a matter of time
before you &apos;re i.d. &apos; d and arrested .
what are you talking about , cuz ?
you were the one pointing the gun .
listen to me . you need to come with me right now
and talk to my people .
your people ?
you mean the drug dealers you ripped off when you were a cop .
stay away from me .
what the hell are you doing ? !
i &apos;m a cop again .
i was trying to cut you a break .
i was trying to do things a different way .
i guess i was wrong .
come on !
in here .
give me a break !
have a seat !
what &apos;s going on ?
this is sid . he was at the football game today .
he &apos;s a part of the samoan gang .
kono ? don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re working with them ?
how do you know him ?
he &apos;s our cousin .
he &apos;s our cousin .
i &apos;m also a cop .
you &apos;re a cop ?
undercover .
chin said you quit the hpd .
that would have been the easy way out .
before i took this assignment , i had the whole department
coming down on me just because i shared blood with this thief .
watch your mouth .
all right , just got off the phone with hpd .
his story checks out .
he &apos;s working with the gang unit .
they got him undercover with the samoans .
that &apos;s what i was trying to tell you .
the police department said that i quit to set up my cover .
i &apos;ve been under with the samoan gangs for 11 months .
trying to identify the major players
and collect enough evidence
to take them down on federal warrants .
what can you tell us about this gang war ?
i ain &apos;t saying another word in front of this dirty cop .
you want to believe i took money from drug raids , that &apos;s fine .
but you &apos;re going to tell us what you know .
i &apos;ll tell these two .
i ain &apos;t talking to you .
you saw sid at the football game , didn &apos;t you ?
and you let him go .
he wasn &apos;t involved in the shooting .
he was trying to get away .
you give him a pass because he &apos;s family .
they didn &apos;t do that for you .
been working my way up .
they &apos;re starting to trust me .
for the past six months ,
i was muscle for their call girl operations .
and finally starting to get in some of their security work .
from what i &apos;ve been able to put together ,
this beef with the triads was instigated by the samoans .
why ?
no idea .
but from what i been hearing ,
it &apos;s going to get a lot worse before it gets better .
we &apos;re in the business of making things better ,
so why don &apos;t you tell us where to start .
there &apos;s a repair shop over on lagoon
samoans sometimes use for deliveries .
been a lot of activity over there lately .
not sure what ... but i heard it something to do
with muscling the triads out of one of the rackets .
if you &apos;re looking for answers--
i &apos;d start there .
so this is where sid thinks the samoans are doing business .
what kind of business ? i &apos;d say chop shop ,
but i can &apos;t see anyone stealing and stripping these hoopties .
you know , i was thinking about it .
i think you should send chin home for a couple days .
law enforcement is chin &apos;s family business ,
so when he lost his badge , he lost his family .
if he wants to wear a badge ,
he has to be able to deal with things like this .
you weren &apos;t held when you were a baby , were you ?
it &apos;s called tough love , partner .
oh , and by the way , i was held .
okay ? i have photos , if you want proof .
photoshop .
so you say something ?
no .
have to give the samoans props .
sure can pack away the pies .
right ?
that &apos;s a lot of pizza .
maybe not .
look at this .
what do you see ?
i don &apos;t see anything .
exactly .
no cheese drips , no grease stains .
nothing . no crust .
doesn &apos;t that seem strange to you ?
not half as strange as it must to a man who lives on take @-@ out .
what do they deliver in these boxes is what i &apos;m saying .
okay , all right , what &apos;s that look ?
what look ?
the look-- the look you give me
when you don &apos;t tell me what you &apos;re thinking about .
next thing i know , i &apos;m getting shot at .
looking for iodine . iodine .
iodine .
look at that , mystery solved .
grab one of those boxes , put it on this table here .
right here ?
yeah .
okay , enough already . what are we doing here ?
when iodine mixes with metal , it forms binary salts .
binary salts-- all right .
is there a reason for this chemistry lesson ?
pay attention . you might learn something .
any metallic objects
that were left in those boxes ...
... will have left trace elements behind .
the iodine will bring it out in a couple of seconds .
wow .
thick crust , extra bullets , please .
yeah .
come on , i can use a good slice . let &apos;s go .
you know what ? this place actually sounds all right .
i &apos;m sure it does .
it says here they fly in the water .
that &apos;s great . yeah .
this town could use a good slice .
it &apos;s a shame we got to put them out of business .
you should try iolani &apos;s in waikiki .
they do the best ham and pineapple on the island ...
oh ! oh !
what ?
let me explain something to you , okay ?
pizza is mozz , sauce and dough .
that is it .
all right , you want to put a pepperoni on your slice
that &apos;s fine , but ham , out .
fruit , out .
okay , i don &apos;t care where we are . pizza and pineapple
do not belong in the same airspace .
i guess you feel quite strongly about this .
that &apos;s cute . did your ex get a new one , too ?
no , it &apos;s ... miserable attorney .
yes , lord vader .
is that a joke ?
yeah , over my dead body .
let me explain to you why .
she is my daughter too , okay ?
i don &apos;t care .
hey , hey ! listen to me !
you scumbag .
you low @-@ life , miserable , money @-@ suck--
hello ? hello ? !
okay . what up ?
rachel is trying to take me back to court over visitation ,
because she says that it is not safe for grace to be around me .
like the football shooting was my fault .
aw , man ...
i &apos;m sorry .
hey , you the owner ?
pie or slice , officers ?
we want to ask you a couple questions .
you mind turning that off ?
i got money on this fight .
okay . i got it .
you have no idea where you are , do you ?
well , we know we &apos;re not in new york , huh ?
from your accent i &apos;d say jersey-- west orange ?
bingo . you , too ?
yeah .
you &apos;re a long way from home .
yeah , don &apos;t remind me .
you &apos;ve been making deliveries to kamomi auto shop ?
yeah . i make a lot of deliveries to a lot of places .
i &apos;ll bet you do .
this one was a special order .
look , i just deliver the pizzas , man , you know ?
what people choose to put in the boxes afterwards ,
that &apos;s up to them .
now if you gentlemen have any more questions ...
speak to my lawyer .
hey , i tried .
i thought you were very reasonable .
your turn .
you guys have been watching too many gangster movies .
how do you figure ?
this whole death march routine .
like i &apos;m supposed to believe a couple of cops
are going to cap me and dump me in the ocean .
please .
we &apos;re not going to shoot you , joey .
whoo , that &apos;s a load off .
hey , joey , you got an &apos; aumakua ?
what &apos;d you call me ?
an &apos; aumakua .
no , what &apos;s an &apos; aum ... what &apos;s that ?
some hawaiians believe that the spirits of their ancestors
appear in other living forms .
oh , for instance , like a shark .
right ?
and that those animals , those specific animals ,
will be there to protect them in times of need .
looks like you could use
one of those &apos; aumakuas right about now , joey .
hey ... what the hell , man ?
those dolphins ? huh ?
hey , hey .
tell me those are dolphins !
hey , hey , hey , hey .
are those sharks ?
no ! no !
come on , joey .
get me out of here !
you let us know when you &apos;re ready to talk , joey .
don &apos;t leave me !
help ! hey !
don &apos;t leave me here ! hey !
hey ... wait !
get me out of here !
let me ask you a question .
are you literally insane ?
oh , relax .
it &apos;s a cage for tourists .
they &apos;re ... they &apos;re homeless galapagos sharks .
they &apos;re not man @-@ eaters .
joey doesn &apos;t know that , though .
hey , you want a beer ? yeah .
to , uh ... to joey .
help !
hey , what are you going to do about your ex , man ?
i have no idea .
gracie &apos;s my life .
if i lose her , i got no reason to be here .
i &apos;d be alone on this island .
hey ! wait !
well , you still got joey .
yeah .
hey ! hey !
we should go get him .
all right , all right .
just get me out of here !
okay . all right .
why are you running guns to the samoans ?
i got business with them .
i know you got business with &apos; em-- what kind of business ?
samoans are helping us squeeze the triads
out of their gambling operations .
we got the guns and money .
the samoans got the muscle and the local what &apos;s @-@ what .
and that &apos;s all i know . i swear . please !
who &apos;s &quot; we &quot; ?
who are you working for ?
salvo .
frank salvo ?
yeah ! yeah ! he &apos;s coming to town tomorrow .
why ?
because the guy he brokered the deal with got clipped .
you know , the guy who got shot at the football game .
salvo wants to see the operation
and sit down with the new boss of the samoan gang
and make sure everything &apos;s straight .
joey , hold up a second .
who &apos;s salvo ?
frank salvo is the head
of the salvo crime family back in jersey .
if he &apos;s the one pulling the strings ,
the real war hasn &apos;t even begun yet .
frank salvo .
suspected of a half dozen kills .
three years ago , he put a bullet
in his uncle to take over the family .
his crews do it all .
okay ? they got prostitution , loan @-@ sharking , protection ,
drugs-- you name it .
the only racket they don &apos;t have is illegal gambling
&apos;cause atlantic city gets all the action .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s setting up shop out here .
of course . honolulu just shot down legalized gambling again .
salvo knows this is an island of opportunity .
he takes over illegal gambling ,
does things his way .
let me tell you , he will spread like a virus .
okay , and since the new jersey mob doesn &apos;t like partners ,
it &apos;s only a matter of time before they cut out the samoans .
once that happens , every street from mauka to makai
will be as bloody as that football field .
well , we have to eliminate the virus .
how ?
according to joey , salvo is here for a sit @-@ down
with the new head of the samoan gang .
this guy-- tuinei . manu sapolu &apos;s underboss .
right .
tomorrow night is tuinei &apos;s big audition
to see if he can run these casinos .
we need to be on the inside ,
getting salvo on tape , spelling out the punch .
okay , how are we going to do that ?
what do you need , cuz ?
said it was urgent .
there &apos;s a rolling casino tonight .
can you get us in ?
i said i was working security detail for something .
then , will you do it ?
putting me in a tough spot , kid .
this thing goes south ,
i risk compromising my investigation .
i wouldn &apos;t be asking you to do this if i didn &apos;t think that
we had a real shot at ending this gang war .
i &apos;ll help you , but i don &apos;t want anything to do with chin ho .
that &apos;s cold , brah .
that is still family .
you think i want to feel this way ?
we were boys , me and chin .
i thought i knew him .
you do know him .
i know that what he did set me back with hpd .
i know if i &apos;m not the one volunteering for the hardest jobs
-the ones that nobody will take--
they &apos;re going to think i &apos;m dirty , too .
you think i like living in a tenement ?
away from my wife and baby almost a year .
that &apos;s what being related to chin ho did for me .
do you ever think for a second
that maybe he didn &apos;t do anything ?
that maybe he was set up ?
all that matters is what the bosses think ,
and they took his badge away .
to think anything else is career suicide .
he protected you at the football field ,
and this is how you pay him back .
he thought i was a gangbanger , and he let me go .
what kind of cop does that ?
the kind that knows how to look after his family .
i worry about you , kono .
you know those hpd guys ,
the ones that you depend on for back up ?
you think they don &apos;t know who your cousin is ?
they &apos;re wrong about him , and so are you .
he &apos;s a good man .
listen , kid .
if you want my help , you got it .
but not chin . end of story .
he &apos;s not going undercover .
everyone knows him on the island .
it &apos;s just me , mcgarrett and danny .
i can probably get you in if you don &apos;t mind serving drinks .
i don &apos;t know about the two haoles .
they clean up nice .
they can go as whales .
trust me .
detour .
i beg of you . i beg of you .
what are you doing ? turn around ! turn around !
i &apos;m in .
copy that .
i have house security online .
aloha , gentlemen .
name ?
edwards .
they &apos;re good to go .
let them in .
that guy &apos;s all yours .
very large .
we &apos;re in .
gotcha .
and you &apos;re loud and clear .
vaveni and soda , please .
what do i look like ?
try one of the ladies holding drinks .
yeah , good idea , right ?
how come i look like a waiter ,
you look like james bond ?
i don &apos;t know .
he doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s talking about .
clearly .
mind if we join you ?
ten to start .
gentlemen , salvo &apos;s on his way in
with tuinei , new samoan boss .
shall we ?
what do you think ?
think he &apos;s got an ace .
such serious men .
how about a ...
drink before business ?
whiskey , straight up .
beer in the bottle .
thank you , sweetheart .
enjoy . hope you like it .
got to come out here more often .
all right , look . now that sapolu &apos;s gone ,
my friends on the mainland are a little concerned
that you could do everything that manu said you could .
we can , and we will .
we &apos;re more motivated than ever
to take out the triads .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m afraid of .
we &apos;re not shipping out all this firepower
and cash for you to finance
some never @-@ ending gang war .
you &apos;re getting paid
to get the triads out of the gambling business
so that we can go on with our operation uncontested .
that &apos;s it .
then your money is being well spent .
you &apos;ve seen for yourself .
the rooms are up and running .
what &apos;s going on ?
these two names-- i have to take ...
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
i cleared them . they &apos;re good to go .
the boss wants to see it .
guys , i &apos;m getting a bad feeling about this .
i need to know from you that you and your people
are going to protect my investment .
what is this ?
i think you need to see this .
you know what to do .
something wrong ?
how is it that you people
have been fumbling around
on this moss @-@ covered rock for generations ,
and in two seconds , my men
find two names on that list
that don &apos;t check out ?
we &apos;ve been made .
get sid in here . he &apos;s running the gate .
i want to see him right now .
my men are handling sid .
you just find the two men that he let in here .
where did they take sid ?
salvo &apos;s got him by the pool .
he &apos;s in trouble .
i &apos;m coming in with backup now .
can i help you ? invitation only .
tell me what i want to know ,
i make it fast and painless .
that &apos;s very considerate of you .
it is when you consider the other option .
which is i put one in your gut and i watch you bleed out .
because that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s gonna happen
if you don &apos;t start talking .
now , who are those two guys you let in here ?
and are you a cop ?
get them the hell out of here !
no , we can &apos;t-- oh , oh , hey .
guys , i &apos;m really sorry . we don &apos;t want any trouble .
use the gun !
rachel , just hear me out .
all right , before you sic your lawyers on me
and try to take grace away from me ,
i want to remind you of something .
i moved 5,000 miles
so that i could see grace twice a week .
twice a week , okay ?
that is 48 hours , 52 times a year ,
for a grand total of 2,500 hours .
when you factor in sleep and school ,
i can really only count on about
400 hours of real face time each year .
and then , you know , that &apos;s only gonna shrink
when she starts making friends
and then she goes off to college .
so , ultimately , that does not leave me with a lot of time
to spend with my daughter .
not as much as i would want .
but i never complained .
i never complained ,
because every single one of those minutes
reminds me of what i am doing and why i am here .
that little girl is my life .
so i am asking you , i am begging you , rachel ,
to please , please , just be kind ...
and don &apos;t take her away from me .
that &apos;s all .
i will get miss rachel , sir .
detective williams , this is rachel &apos;s counsel .
yeah , will you put rachel on , please ?
