if all the good folks in boston
are tucked into bed ,
what are you doing awake at this hour ?
tell me what keeps you up at night .
is it love ? adventure ?
mystery ?
share your secrets with me ,
and maybe i &apos;ll share some of mine with you .
i &apos;m waiting for you .
i know you &apos;re out there .
don &apos;t be shy .
all my lines are open .
call me ...
hello ... the first call --
what do we got ?
should &apos;ve paid more attention in shop class .
thanks for stoppin &apos; .
i hope you know about engines ,
because i can &apos;t tell a gasket from ...
come in !
really ?
that &apos;s my mine .
i would not put your mail in my mouth .
by the way , bad idea letting the mailbox overflow .
it tells a burglar that you &apos;re on vacation ,
even when you &apos;re not .
what &apos;s with the catalogues ?
i don &apos;t know .
a few weeks ago , they started arriving in droves .
i was on one of those &quot; no junk mail &quot; lists ,
but apparently i have been dropped .
&quot; a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime opportunity
to explore the ecosystem of the galapagos island .
oh , the only island your father ever took me to
was castle island ,
and that was for the submarine races .
well , technically ,
castle island hasn &apos;t really been a harbor island
since it was connected to boston proper
with landfill in the 1800s .
so i can &apos;t see you could watch submarine races .
that was the point .
gross , ma .
anyway , i would like to go the galapagos island .
swim with the turtles and march with the penguins ,
whatever people do in the galapogos .
all right , mom , you let us know how that works out for you .
oh , my !
okay , those are beautiful . where did they come from ?
i don &apos;t know .
and they &apos;re not in my size .
chez katia .
chez katia ? that &apos;s strange . i haven &apos;t shopped there in ages .
sounds like a variation of the bait and switch ploy .
you know ?
chez katia is a very reputable boutique .
yes , and chez katia sends you a beautiful pair of shoes
in the wrong size .
you love them , so you will go to chez katia
and you will buy the right size .
but while you &apos;re there , mademoiselle ...
maybe you could buy all ze shoes
and give us all ze money .
well , if it is a ploy , it &apos;s going to work ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m gonna stop and exchange them
on the way to the office .
rizzoli . you know what ?
a couple of hours isn &apos;t gonna make a difference.yeah.
besides , those shoes don &apos;t match your dress .
good point .
isles .
can you get me a good shot of the
cell phone relative to the body ?
what do we got ?
not exactly the convivial greeting i was expecting .
well , a very good morning to you , sergeant korsak .
yes , it is a good morning . not so much for him .
yeah . good point .
this is todd reynolds . 32 .
night shift freight manager at rapid courier .
reported missing by his wife early this morning
when she woke up and realized he didn &apos;t make it home
from his shift .
did someone move him ?
not that i know of .
he was dead when the cops found him .
road &apos;s pretty isolated . is this on his way home ?
yeah . it &apos;s a straight shot from where he works .
no body damage to the car .
no skid marks or brake marks .
exterior &apos;s immaculate . there &apos;s no sign of an accident .
well , it &apos;s parked pretty straight ,
telling us that he probably wasn &apos;t forced off the road .
laptop and grocery bag in the front seat .
well , that bag takes up the entire backseat ,
so he was alone .
clothes are neatly folded , so nobody &apos;s rifled through it .
and there &apos;s 40 bucks in his wallet .
so it &apos;s not a robbery .
and keys are in the ignition .
no .
well , everything seems to be in order .
what made him stop ?
maybe he met someone .
could be a sexual liaison gone awry .
do you think so , mr. holmes ?
kiki suggested that i expand my vocabulary
and not use cop talk all the time .
it &apos;s a nice isolated spot for a drug transaction .
maybe he was flagged down
and then beaten to death when he helped .
maura , did you find anything ?
well , the time of death was approximately eight hours ago .
there &apos;s significant blunt force trauma
confined to the area of the head and the face .
defensive injuries ?
can &apos;t be sure until after the autopsy .
but if no one moved him ,
the only explanation for that blood spatter
is that the first blows didn &apos;t kill him .
and the small drops here indicate that the victim was
low to the ground and moving forward .
he was crawling .
and they increase in size here .
he was trying to get to his feet .
then the assailant struck him again .
that looks like blood .
hey , can we get a picture of this ?
it &apos;s unlikely that our victim reached for a handkerchief
while he was being beaten to death .
well ...
maybe we caught a break , and it belongs to our killer .
wife &apos;s name is florence .
division detectives had already notified her when i arrived .
she say anything ?
i haven &apos;t talked to her
except to get permission to search the office .
they have a son .
how old ?
10 .
all right , thanks .
mrs. reynolds ?
my name is detective jane rizzoli .
i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
i @-@ i feel like if i ...
stay here and keep watching logan ,
todd will come home .
who would want to hurt my husband ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but i will do my best to find out .
can i ask you a couple questions ?
okay .
what time did todd normally get home from work ?
around 2 : 00 .
sometimes a little later
if he &apos;s hungry and he stops for something to eat .
was he meeting someone after work ?
who would he be meeting ?
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
do you know if todd had a drug problem ?
no , detective .
todd didn &apos;t use drugs .
he barely drank .
and no , he wasn &apos;t having an affair .
how do you know for sure ?
i lost my job this year .
the bills started to pile up .
todd changed shifts for the extra hours ,
but every free moment he had , he spent with us .
there wasn &apos;t room in his day for someone else .
what was his relationship like with your son ?
they were inseparable .
peas in a pod .
do you mind if i ask him a couple questions ?
okay .
sure .
thank you .
hey , logan .
my name is jane rizzoli . i &apos;m a detective .
and i &apos;m really sorry about what happened to your dad .
you ever seen one of those up close before ?
you know why i have it ?
so people will know you &apos;re the police .
that &apos;s right .
and it also reminds me that i have a job to do ,
and that job is to help people when bad things happen to them .
you understand ?
yes .
what helps me do my job is if people talk to me .
people like you .
is there anything you wanna tell me ?
i could really use your help , logan .
a man came here two days ago .
dad looked through the peephole and sent me to my room .
he say why you had to go to your room ?
dad wanted to talk in private .
can you tell me what they said ?
will you tell my mother ?
not if i don &apos;t need to , no .
my dad didn &apos;t want her to know .
think he &apos;d want me to know ?
the man came in and was yelling a lot .
dad told him to be quiet because i was in the other room .
the man kept yelling .
and what did you do ?
i got scared and put a pillow over my ears
so i wouldn &apos;t hear the yelling anymore .
but ... but the man got madder .
dad said he was calling the police .
did he call the police ?
no .
the man left .
i heard the door slam , then it was quiet .
you did a really good job remembering all that .
thank you .
is there a reason
that your father didn &apos;t want your mother to know ?
he said it would just make her worry .
right .
did you happen to get a look at the guy at the door ?
no . i didn &apos;t .
but i &apos;ll never forget his voice .
todd &apos;s son might be able to identify his killer
by his voice .
there &apos;s a recent study that shows
that the ability to recognize a voice
diminishes with time .
almost 70 % in less than 2 weeks .
well , then we should find whoever did this quickly .
please , no dawdling , doctor .
i don &apos;t know the meaning of the word .
well , of course i know the meaning of the word .
i just meant that ...
yeah , i got it . yeah .
what &apos;s up , chang ?
i have a preliminary toxicology report .
the initial toxicology screen was negative .
and my physical examination showed no evidence
of any past substance abuse .
so he wasn &apos;t making a drug deal last night .
sexual assault ?
no indications of any recent sexual activity .
okay , what about the handkerchief ?
we just started processing the victim &apos;s clothing
for trace evidence .
the handkerchief &apos;s up next .
uh , what about the murder weapon ?
well , the initial strike was to the front of the skull . here .
yes .
i &apos;m thinking a piece of rebar .
he was struck again along the jawline near the neck ,
but as i expected , it was not fatal .
which is what we saw at the crime scene .
so the killer thought he was done . todd moved .
he hit him again ...
probably with an iron pipe .
this strike fractured the skull , resulting in death .
yes , i hear you loud and clear .
the murder weapon was long and fat and soft .
fine . fine .
the weapon was likely a metal rod ,
less than a half an inch thick .
yes , it could &apos;ve been a tire iron
or a piece of rebar or a steel pipe
or about a thousand other metal instrumentalities .
thank you . defensive wounds ?
no defensive wounds , jane . this attack was unexpected .
so either he didn &apos;t see it coming ,
or he knew his killer and wasn &apos;t afraid of him .
or her .
do you think it was a jilted lover ?
that &apos;s not what i said .
you kind of did .
thanks , chang .
i @-@ i said that . i didn &apos;t think you said that .
you said something totally different
that implied something else .
i spoke with todd &apos;s coworkers .
he was , by all accounts , a decent guy .
polite , considerate , and respectful .
we confirmed he left at the end of his shift at 2 : 00 a.m.
then he went to the all day market .
he bought yogurt and a candy bar .
receipt says 2 : 20 a.m.
it &apos;s only a few minutes from the store
to where we found his car and his body .
and there &apos;s no evidence yet of any ...
extramarital philandering .
give it to me .
but it &apos;s a gift from kiki .
and you can have it back
when you &apos;re promoted to lieutenant .
right now i need you to speak like a real cop .
as i was saying , if this guy was screwing around ,
it &apos;d be difficult to hide it in this electronic age .
if there was an affair , it &apos;ll turn up .
i also put our m.o. into n.c.i.c.
on the off chance that this was a thrill kill ,
somebody &apos;s done this before .
god , i hope not .
some random , side of the road nutbag
would really slow down our investigation .
if you use the thesaurus ,
you could come up with a nicer word than &quot; nutbag . &quot;
&quot; nutholder . &quot;
financials show their credit cards maxed out months ago .
all the charges look like household expenses .
so if he &apos;s having an affair , he &apos;s not charging it .
they took out a second mortgage six months ago .
that money &apos;s gone .
but there were two large cash deposits
into their checking account a month ago .
nobody &apos;s giving him a third mortgage .
do we know where that money came from ?
no place that files paperwork .
well , every neighborhood has the guy you go to
when the banks turn you down .
can you check around for a loan shark ?
it &apos;s like you said .
it &apos;s hard to hide anything in this electronic day and age ...
like maybe someone who was incarcerated
in a penal colony for usury .
delicious .
thank you , shauna . see you soon .
may i help you ?
yes . these shoes seem to have been sent to me by accident .
oh , my goodness . i &apos;m so sorry . these were for dr. isles .
i understand , expect i -- - i don &apos;t understand
why these went out .
they were supposed to be held here
with all her other selections .
all of her other selections ?
is that ...
it is . dr. isles has incredible taste .
i like to think so .
do you know her ?
no , i don &apos;t .
but i look forward to meeting her .
do you have this in my size ?
we do .
come see me at 4 : 00 .
don &apos;t make me come find you .
loan @-@ sharking has gotten a lot easier in the age of voice mail .
yeah . no more chasing deadbeat clients down dark alleys .
come on , guys .
do i look like someone who chases people down dark alleys ?
all right ,
in the interest of keeping a good relationship with the cops ,
i &apos;ll cooperate .
todd owed me money .
about $ 15,000 .
what does that add up to with the vig , chris ?
it &apos;s not like that .
i lend money to people the banks won &apos;t .
a gangster with a heart of gold .
you don &apos;t put money on the street
without a collection plan .
that &apos;s true . it &apos;s very true .
but there &apos;s a big difference between scaring someone
and killing them .
dead people don &apos;t pay their debts .
where were you last night ?
at home with my wife .
read it . out loud .
in the interest of keeping a good relationship with the cops .
&quot; no , i &apos;m not going to shut up
and i &apos;m not forgiving anything . &quot;
would you read the last line louder , please ?
i &apos;m not forgiving anything .
you recognize his voice , logan ?
we have to do this the right way . okay ?
we have to make sure it &apos;s the truth .
it &apos;s not him .
okay .
and the saleswoman loves her and she has interesting taste .
i mean , take this dress , for instance .
i might never have chosen it because of the flare .
well , i think you should cancel your credit cards
and report this to the police ,
which should be easy given this building is full of them .
not yet .
you know , i have been interested in the imposter phenomenon
since that paper by clance and imes .
it &apos;s fascinating how it manifests itself
in high achieving women .
well , i think the imposter has an interest
in your high credit limit .
and more than likely , she is convinced
that she is not worthy of her accomplishments .
but i am not sure why she &apos;d want to be me .
to steal your money .
well , of course i know that ,
but i do have a chance to observe her up close .
wait , what do you mean
you have a chance to observe her up close ?
you &apos;re not thinking of doing something crazy , are you ?
well , she made a reservation on my credit card
for the newbury for tomorrow .
dr. isles , i ...
i &apos;m only going to observe her .
i &apos;m gonna listen in on her conversations
and see what makes her tick .
now take a look at this .
there &apos;s blood spatter on the grille of todd &apos;s car ,
but not on the hood .
well , the void could be from the killer &apos;s body .
did you tell detective rizzoli about this identify thief ?
no , not yet .
because once i tell her ,
she &apos;s gonna get all detective @-@ y ...
and then i won &apos;t be able to observe the imposter
in its natural habitat .
she &apos;s not a gorilla in the congo .
i mean , that actually sounds safer
than what you &apos;re talking about .
i promise not to make contact .
besides , i &apos;m bringing backup .
now let &apos;s go take a look at todd &apos;s car .
chris alexander &apos;s wife said he was with her all night long .
i don &apos;t necessarily believe her , but i believe logan reynolds .
sergeant korsak ?
yeah ?
a detective guthrie from camden .
maine ?
yes , sir . maine .
he called about your n.c.i.c. request .
what &apos;s he got for us ?
all he said was he &apos;ll be traveling down here tomorrow ,
wants to come by .
i hope this isn &apos;t someone using a case
to get some good italian food in the big city .
i have traveled for less .
hello .
there is blood spatter on the underside the hood .
which means todd was attacked
while he was checking the engine .
why would he do that ? the car started at the crime scene .
yes , and when we found
that all systems were in perfect working order ,
i developed a theory .
are you going to share that theory ?
in a moment . i &apos;m waiting .
this is not the dress you wore to work this morning .
that is an interesting story that i &apos;m sure dr. isles --
would be very happy to share my theory with you .
this is my theory .
the suction from the fuel pump pulled the sock over the filter .
which blocked the gas to the engine and stalled the car .
exactly .
so todd &apos;s car was sabotaged .
well , it could &apos;ve been put in his tank when he was at work
or when he stopped at the store .
either way , all the killer had to do was follow him home
and wait for the car to stall out .
that &apos;s right .
i &apos;m gonna have nina pull up security videos
from todd &apos;s work and the store .
maybe we can get a look at whoever did it .
okay .
do we have any idea on motive ?
no , nothing yet .
come on , the black bears haven &apos;t won a conference title
since 2004 .
hey , they took b.c. , b.u. , and u.n.h. last season .
their time is coming .
yeah , but they still gotta get past northeastern .
detective rizzoli ,
this is the detective from camden , maine .
mike guthrie .
right . yeah .
thanks for coming . i &apos;m jane rizzoli .
what do you got for us ?
who the hell gave you my evidence ?
it &apos;s not . it &apos;s mine .
we &apos;re hunting the same killer .
my first case as a detective .
ruth simons , late 60s .
was found beaten to death
on the side of a pretty desolate road .
aren &apos;t all roads in maine desolate ?
only the ones that go through the towns .
looked like she pulled over , got out , and was attacked .
robbery ?
no . we ruled it out at the crime scene .
her pocketbook , money ...
hell , even her groceries weren &apos;t touched .
where &apos;d she do her shopping ?
all day market .
that &apos;s the same chain that &apos;s in our case .
didn &apos;t make sense that she &apos;d stop in such a remote place ,
so i kept looking ...
till i found this in the gas tank .
random nutholder ?
yep .
our crime lab guys
took a look at the sock and the handkerchief .
they came up empty on any dna .
i know this might be asking a lot , but ...
your crime lab is way more advanced than ours . so ...
could you get them to retest this stuff ?
uh , yeah .
frankie , can you take this stuff down to the crime lab ?
maybe they can get started on it ?
sure thing .
thank you .
this is the most optimistic i &apos;ve been in two years .
before i head back to the hotel ,
i just wanted to say thank you .
yeah . you &apos;re welcome .
and thank you .
did the handkerchief in your case
have a &quot; v &quot; cut into one side ?
i don &apos;t know . but our criminalists are the best .
if it &apos;s there , they &apos;ll find it .
man , i &apos;ve been driving like a madman for hours .
i need coffee .
the division one cafe is on the first floor .
coffee &apos;s not good , but it &apos;s cheap and it &apos;s hot .
oh , my god . i &apos;ve heard of this place ,
but i never thought i &apos;d actually eat here .
this is so much better than the galapagos islands .
well , i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s true , but i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
hello .
has dr. isles arrived yet ?
are you part of her group ?
aren &apos;t we lucky ?
everyone &apos;s at the bar .
that &apos;s her .
of course she &apos;s in couture .
oh ! no , no . i need you as my cover .
oh . okay .
i wanna document her on a video .
well , i guess she &apos;s funny .
i &apos;m funny .
of course you are , maura .
why don &apos;t we call jane now ?
no . no .
then my observations of the imposter phenomenon
would be incomplete .
let me get a little bit closer .
okay , whoa , whoa . whoa , whoa .
didn &apos;t you say that the imposter phenomenon
manifests itself in high @-@ achieving women ?
yes .
okay .
that is no high @-@ achieving woman .
that &apos;s some con artist
who happened to have your credit card number .
sit .
sit .
this field trip is not just to observe
the imposter phenomenon .
what ?
well , what else is it ?
when i saw her selections at the boutique ,
i @-@ i reviewed my credit card statement .
she made a spa and yoga combo i never would &apos;ve thought of .
she &apos;s here at the newbury ,
a place i &apos;ve always wanted to go and i never have .
she is living my life better than i am .
maura , she &apos;s a paper doll .
she hung a beautiful dress on herself ,
she added a fabulous pair of shoes ,
but none of it makes her you .
she &apos;s not smarter or better than you , maura .
you &apos;ve earned the respect and the love
from all the people in your life .
what &apos;s better than that ?
thank you . thank you , angela .
help ! someone , please help me !
oh , god !
call 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 . i &apos;m a doctor .
we need your help .
okay , let &apos;s get him down to the ground . move him gently .
it &apos;s the emergency medical service .
this is dr. maura isles .
i &apos;ve got an adult male , approximately 65 years old ,
in sudden cardiac arrest .
i &apos;m initiating c.p.r.
i understand why guthrie &apos;s so desperate for help .
he &apos;s got nothing . feels like we got nothing .
well , we didn &apos;t get anything from the security video .
i &apos;ll check with all day market ,
see if any of their employees transferred
from maine to boston .
maybe the store is the common denominator .
okay .
oh , hello .
how was your field trip with my mother ?
are the gorillas all right ?
susie confessed to me
that she told you about my identity theft .
yes , she did .
what &apos;s this ?
this is your incident report , ready for you to sign .
maura , why didn &apos;t you tell me about this ?
i just wanted to see who she was ,
maybe learn something about myself before you ...
got all detective @-@ y ?
i just knew you would not approve of my field trip .
i do not approve ,
and not just because i &apos;m a cop ,
because i &apos;m your friend .
what you did could &apos;ve been dangerous .
i took your mother .
which is dangerous in it &apos;s own way .
did you get a look at this fake dr. isles ?
no . i was too busy being the real dr. isles .
aren &apos;t you concerned about cross contamination ?
it &apos;s just they &apos;re both on the same table , and --
oh , no , i already swabbed both the handkerchiefs for d.n.a.
this is just the comparison examination .
okay .
so are they the same ?
uh , well , i can tell you that
the boston handkerchief does not have a notch cut in its side .
even i can see that .
what about the material ? is that the same ?
well , the maine handkerchief is made up of 100 % cotton fibers .
the same as ours .
uh , the thread count is 160 .
it &apos;s a pretty low @-@ end hanky .
but i don &apos;t see any evidence of organic materials
or discoloration that would indicate the presence of blood .
now that being said ...
i &apos;ve removed a small sample ...
to examine for the presence of saliva --
ohh . what the hell &apos;s going on ?
oh , no ! frankie !
okay !
got it ! yeah !
oh , my god .
oh , no .
we did our best to try to protect the evidence ,
but there was just so much water .
does water destroy d.n.a. ?
no . worse . it washes it away .
so you &apos;re telling me
that everything the water touched is contaminated ?
even if there was d.n.a. on this ,
we wouldn &apos;t be able to prove
that is didn &apos;t wash onto it from somewhere else .
i @-@ i &apos;d hate to be the one to tell guthrie that
two years of his work went down the drain -- literally .
larry , what happened ?
there was a fire in the men &apos;s room .
in the men &apos;s room ?
small trash can fire .
somebody sneaking a cigarette .
system extinguished it in 15 seconds .
i &apos;m so sorry , dr. isles .
i mean , what kinda idiot smokes a cigarette in the bathroom ?
that &apos;s a really good question , larry .
i can &apos;t believe some dumb @-@ ass
threw a lit cigarette in the trash can .
they didn &apos;t . look at this .
nobody smoked this cigarette .
they just used it to start the fire .
there has been a development in the evidence .
you were able to find something ?
not exactly . um ...
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve noticed all the commotion going on out there .
yeah . i thought that was a fire alarm test .
didn &apos;t seem to last 10 seconds .
15 seconds exactly .
um , there was a small fire in the men &apos;s room downstairs .
oh . i hope no one was hurt .
no . no , no one was hurt .
but the alarms did set off the sprinklers in the lab
while we were testing both handkerchiefs .
the evidence is ruined .
i can &apos;t believe this . damn it .
this whole case has been one roadblock after another .
i am so sorry .
i guess it &apos;s time i went back to maine .
maybe it &apos;s time to put this case behind me .
i understand , but--
ooh ! what the hell ? !
i @-@ i @-@ i am so sorry .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
what &apos;s wrong with your whole department ?
i know .
i , um ... please , at least let me pay to get those cleaned .
it -- it &apos;s the least i can do .
you think that &apos;s gonna make right what you &apos;ve done ?
it doesn &apos;t . it doesn &apos;t fix anything .
please , at least let me pay to get those cleaned .
it -- it &apos;s the least i can do .
you think that &apos;s gonna make right what you &apos;ve done ?
it doesn &apos;t . it doesn &apos;t fix anything .
that &apos;s him .
logan just i.d.ed guthrie &apos;s voice
as the guy he heard arguing with his father .
now that &apos;s not enough to put him away , but ...
well , i just found the connection between todd and mike guthrie .
they went to summer camp together 25 years ago .
so todd shows up on his porch yelling and screaming
&apos;cause he lost a badminton game 25 years ago ?
there was a reunion two weeks ago .
i tracked down one of the campers who was there .
apparently that summer ,
guthrie was teased by his cabinmates .
well , everybody gets teased at camp .
yeah , but guthrie was a bed wetter .
this guy said the teasing was pretty vicious .
then let me guess--
todd reynolds was the leader of the pack .
you got it .
guthrie was so miserable that he had to call his stepfather
to come take him home .
when the stepfather got there ,
he decided to teach guthrie a lesson .
he spanked the poor kid in front of the entire camp .
what ? !
after something like that ?
it &apos;s possible guthrie reorganized his life
so that he could never be humiliated again .
and you and i both know cops who got the badge
just so nobody could push them around anymore .
more than a few .
so what ? the -- the reunion set him off ?
maura said a guy like guthrie ,
someone who was humiliated and left powerless by an abusive stepfather
would have repressed his anger . &quot;
until the reunion triggers an explosion .
so why not fight right there ?
why wait two weeks ?
guthrie didn &apos;t go .
but at the reunion , todd told my guy
that he felt guilty about the teasings ,
said he wanted to make things right .
well , maybe he reached out to guthrie ,
and that &apos;s what lit the fuse .
if that &apos;s so , we need to track down all these cabinmates .
if he &apos;s been repressing anger for 25 years ,
he may be just getting started .
i located guthrie &apos;s ther four cabin buddies
from camp 25 years ago .
braintree , marshfield ,
wareham , and new bedford .
how about frankie ? is he still trailing guthrie ?
as far as i know .
i &apos;m tracking frankie &apos;s cell phone g.p.s. signal .
that &apos;s him there .
going north of the city .
yeah , you &apos;re right ,
and all the other cabin buddies live south of the city .
you think guthrie &apos;s going back home to maine ?
could be . maybe all he wanted to do
was destroy the evidence against him .
they &apos;re getting off the highway .
get frankie on the phone , would you ?
no service . must be in a dead zone .
where the hell is he going ?
you know , when i ran todd &apos;s phone records ,
there was a phone call to a number north of boston .
who was it to ?
dana slowey , 2012 trent avenue , revere .
any calls between slowey and guthrie ?
quite a few calls between them ,
mostly from dana to guthrie .
the last one was minutes after todd called dana .
13 domestic assault and battery charges .
three claims of child endangerment .
lost his driver &apos;s license after his fifth drunk driving conviction .
this guy &apos;s a beauty .
do you think we found the stepfather ?
given the story i heard about the stepfather showing up
at camp and making the kid &apos;s life worse ,
i &apos;m guessing that &apos;s guthrie &apos;s stepfather .
i guess guthrie finally realized
killing the other campers wasn &apos;t gonna solve his real problem .
i &apos;m gonna call jane and have her meet me at the car .
if you get through to frankie ,
bring him up to speed , would you ?
it &apos;s frankie . yeah ?
he &apos;s been sitting here for 45 minutes .
any idea why he &apos;s waiting ?
no , but keep your eyes peeled .
the stepfather lives two blocks away .
shouldn &apos;t we take him down now , then ?
all right , you got three kids coming through .
you wait &apos;ll they get past to make a move .
i can &apos;t believe we didn &apos;t check this guy &apos;s story .
it wouldn &apos;t have done much good .
i mean , guthrie just added a few phony details
to one of his own cases .
besides , when &apos;s the last time someone checked on us
when we went into another jurisdiction ?
never .
if that much .
he &apos;s moving across the street .
shit . he was waiting on the bus .
let &apos;s go and take him .
freeze !
put it down , mike !
hey , you know what ? don &apos;t worry about it .
he hasn &apos;t got the balls to shoot me .
kid &apos;s always been a pussy .
i am not a pussy . i &apos;m a cop !
you &apos;re a cop ? in maine .
who &apos;s gonna hurt you there , huh ? a big moose ?
shut up ! oh , please don &apos;t shoot me , mikey .
you think i &apos;m scared of you ?
go ahead . shoot him , mike .
hey , come on . you friggin &apos; crazy ?
yeah . shoot him .
he deserves it .
you were just mad at todd .
but this guy ? this guy deserves it . shoot him .
korsak , frankie -- they won &apos;t say a thing .
not me .
hey , come on .
knock it off .
he did nothing but bully and hurt you your entire life .
anybody would understand if you did it .
okay ?
i &apos;d understand .
why couldn &apos;t i kill him ?
what &apos;d i tell ya ?
he &apos;s a pussy . you let a girl take a gun from you ?
man , shut up or i &apos;ll shoot you myself !
let &apos;s go .
you wouldn &apos;t say anything , right ?
not a word .
it was right after i told him
that you caught the man who ...
killed todd .
he said he had a question for you .
he won &apos;t tell em what it is .
he -- he said it was personal .
it &apos;s okay .
thank you , by the way , for ...
you &apos;re welcome .
hey , bud .
your mom said you have a question for me .
is this yours ?
no .
it belonged to a friend of mine .
does he play with it ?
not anymore .
if i &apos;d told my mom about the man coming to our house ,
would my dad be alive today ?
listen to me .
nothing you did caused your father &apos;s death .
okay ?
and there is nothing you could &apos;ve done
that would &apos;ve stopped it .
but you did help us find the man who did it .
and i know that your father would be very ...
very proud of you for that .
hello ?
hey .
ta @-@ da !
what &apos;s this ?
this is the paperwork on the phony dr. isles .
she was arrested earlier this evening .
oh , where was she ? at the spa ?
no , don &apos;t tell me . she was at la manage .
she was actually , uh ,
trying to pass a stolen credit card
at darlene &apos;s wig shop .
um , believe it or not ,
she has a lengthy record of scams and stolen ids . so ...
i &apos;m so sorry that i romanticized her
and probably cost some other unfortunate person more misery .
but how did you even know who she was ?
i never saw her face .
well , actually , uh ...
taking my mother as backup was a really good idea .
you know that she wasn &apos;t gonna
let this woman get away with it scot @-@ free . so ...
i actually can &apos;t believe that she figured out
how to use the camera on her phone .
your mother is very resourceful .
yes , she is .
and that picture made the case .
the detectives were able to charge her
with a much more serious felony .
well , what &apos;s more serious than identity theft ?
making the chief medical examiner
question her life &apos;s work .
well , i think it &apos;s just a shame that this woman
can &apos;t use her powers for good .
what , her powers to steal other people &apos;s lives ?
no , not that .
you know , her gift for accessorizing , for juxtaposition .
that spa and yoga combo
was brilliant .
it was brilliant .
you could be brilliant , too ,
if you &apos;d just become a ne &apos;er @-@ do @-@ well con woman .
what &apos;s that ?
my imposter ordered some fine french wine
that she never picked up
well , wasn &apos;t she the gift that keeps on giving ?
yay . alright , but i would like to
chef &apos;s depose this wine with a pizza .
well actually , it &apos;d be more accurate to accessorize .
stop crackin &apos; me . eat the pizza !
here
what if i &apos;ll give you the pizza @-@ earrings
