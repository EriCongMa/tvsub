第三季 第九集
wisteria lane &apos;s new hero ... &lt; / i &gt;
hello ?
superhero houses are great !
turned out to be anything but . &lt; / i &gt;
orson &apos;s mother took up residence . &lt; / i &gt;
i &apos;ve decided to accept your wife &apos;s kind invitation .
you wouldn &apos;t .
mike couldn &apos;t remember ... &lt; / i &gt;
no memory ?
that &apos;s convenient .
... anything at all . &lt; / i &gt;
here &apos;s our search warrant .
we couldn &apos;t find the toolbox .
you might want to wash that wrench off .
it &apos;s got something on it .
i &apos;m just saying that
we never spend the night at your house .
yes , but your place is so warm and cozy .
it &apos;s also a disaster area .
i didn &apos;t get a chance to clean it today .
oh , here . let me .
susan mayer had never thought of herself as cinderella , &lt; / i &gt;
but then one day ...
a prince showed up ... &lt; / i &gt;
well , we can &apos;t have you sleeping in squalor , can we ?
my place it is .
... and susan realized her life
had become a fairy tale . &lt; / i &gt;
and since her prince had welcomed her into his castle , &lt; / i &gt;
she felt the least she could do was thank him . &lt; / i &gt;
again ...
and again ...
and again . &lt; / i &gt;
the next morning , however , susan discovered castles ... &lt; / i &gt;
don &apos;t run themselves . &lt; / i &gt;
all right .
but let &apos;s make it a quickie
because you are wasting water .
sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to startle you .
uh ... who are you ?
i &apos;m rupert .
i work for mr. hainsworth .
that would be the man you slept with ,
in case names weren &apos;t exchanged .
no . i &apos;m your boss &apos;s girlfriend .
surely , he mentioned me .
not that i recollect .
rupert .
good morning , boss .
i thought you were off today .
isn &apos;t your sister in town ?
that &apos;s next weekend , sir .
it &apos;s a good thing too .
otherwise , i might not have had the pleasure of
meeting your girlfriend .
susan .
yes . we met at the hospital .
why don &apos;t i fetch you a robe ?
loving that idea .
would you care for some breakfast ?
omelet , strawberry tart , brioche ?
yeah . that sounds great . you pick .
yes , susan &apos;s life had indeed &lt; / i &gt;
become a fairy tale . &lt; / i &gt;
you are aware there is a mrs. hainsworth ?
well , of course .
and what &apos;s a fairy tale ... &lt; / i &gt;
tart it is .
... without a dragon to slay ? &lt; / i &gt;
we know dangerous men walk among us . &lt; / i &gt;
what we can &apos;t be sure of is who they are
or where they hide . &lt; / i &gt;
so the most we can offer any stranger is reasonable doubt . &lt; / i &gt;
but once the doubt is gone ,
people are anything but reasonable . &lt; / i &gt;
i am telling you , our neighbor is a pedophile ,
and i expect you to do something about it .
ms. scavo , he &apos;s not listed on
any sex offender registry .
he &apos;s never had a traffic ticket .
he &apos;s a single man
with a basement full of toys !
i understand your concern ,
but we can &apos;t book a guy on possession of toys .
you don &apos;t get it . his house had this creepy vibe .
tell him , tom .
i never went down to the actual room .
okay , he wasn &apos;t in there . he doesn &apos;t know .
look , he had a wall full of pictures
of half @-@ naked boys in swimsuits .
didn &apos;t you say he was a swim coach ?
what are you , his lawyer ?
you have to admit , it &apos;s odd .
here &apos;s what &apos;s odd .
if your neighbor had something to hide ,
why &apos;d he invite you in to see all of his stuff ?
he wasn &apos;t technically home when i went inside .
so you broke in ?
the door was open .
i was bringing him a cake .
a cake ?
it was a thank @-@ you cake .
he sort of saved my life .
she didn &apos;t know he was a pedophile when she baked the actual cake .
he doesn &apos;t care the cake , tom .
why snap at me ?
i &apos;m not snapping at you .
you snapped .
i am snapping because there is a monster across the street ,
and barney fife here &apos;s making me sound like the bad guy !
i &apos;m sorry . she &apos;s been under a lot of stress ,
hasn &apos;t slept well .
you better not be apologizing for me !
gotta go .
so i &apos;ve got some fabulous news .
well , i hope it &apos;s more fabulous than this dress .
i look like something ike turner would hit .
you &apos;re gonna have to find yourself another personal shopper .
i slam one dress ,
and you quit on me ?
no , that &apos;s my news .
i &apos;m leaving the store and starting my own business .
&quot; beauty by vern . &quot; you &apos;re opening up a salon ?
god , could you get any gayer ?
it &apos;s a consulting firm for beauty pageant contestants .
and the answer &apos;s yes .
this week i &apos;m coaching girls
for the miss snowflake pageant .
it &apos;s very rewarding .
hey , you know what might be fun ?
if you come and give a talk .
give the kids some pointers .
vern . i worked the catwalks in milan and paris .
i &apos;m not gonna give makeup tips to little miss training bra .
you have been in rare bitch form .
it &apos;s been months ,
so don &apos;t blame it on your cycle .
don &apos;t call me a bitch . and stop tracking my cycle .
i told you , that freaks me out .
i &apos;m just saying , you &apos;ve been very cranky today .
what &apos;s going on ?
the divorce decree came through today .
carlos is officially out of my life .
oh , honey ...
the girls &apos; ages range eight to twelve .
we meet every thursday in the rec room of the elks lodge .
i &apos;m not doing it .
you need a project .
that &apos;s your problem , you &apos;re bored .
and you know what the cure for that is ?
helping others .
fine . i &apos;ll do it .
but i want this dress for free .
evil . you said you hated it .
and i hate helping others too ,
but i &apos;m doing that , aren &apos;t i ?
is the coast clear ?
i don &apos;t want to flash the help again .
relax . he &apos;s making breakfast .
you &apos;re more than welcome to flash me .
how long has rupert worked for you ?
oh , for years . he &apos;s practically family .
so you &apos;re that close ,
and you never told him about me ?
yes , about that ...
rupert was incredibly devoted to jane .
he &apos;s never seen me with another woman ,
let alone a frisky , naked one .
that explains why he was a little cold to me this morning .
was he ? i &apos;ll have a talk with him .
oh , no . don &apos;t do that .
that &apos;ll just make it worse .
i get it . he loved jane .
he doesn &apos;t know me .
you know , i &apos;ll just have to charm him .
warm him up a little .
well , i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll find a way .
great , 9 : 00 in the morning
and i have to put on a slinky black cocktail dress .
hey , here &apos;s an idea .
you keep some things in a drawer at my house .
would it be ok if i had one here ?
a drawer ? do you think we &apos;ll be here that often ?
your shower has six power nozzles .
with or without you , i &apos;ll be back .
well , then , by all means , let &apos;s get you a drawer .
i don &apos;t need much . one of those will do .
actually , that &apos;s not a good idea .
rupert arranges things meticulously .
you &apos;ll never win him over
if you mess with his system .
rupert ?
your timing &apos;s perfect .
not always .
susan will be needing a drawer .
a drawer , sir ?
yes . for her things .
she &apos;s going to be spending more time here .
yeah , rupe .
i hope we can be good friends ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re gonna be seeing lots more of me .
oh , madam , that hardly seems possible .
mother hodge , your food will get cold .
why , please , is there a lock on the liquor cabinet ?
because your doctor says
people taking your medication shouldn &apos;t drink ,
a warning you &apos;ve chosen to ignore
if the lipstick on the vodka bottle is any indication .
poached fish again ? i don &apos;t want this .
i want what you &apos;re all having .
well , your doctor has you on a low fat , low sodium diet .
eight meals this week ,
eight times i &apos;ve told you the same thing .
so who would like to say grace ?
allow me .
dear lord , i thank you for
this bland , indifferently prepared meal ,
and beseech you to ignite some spark of compassion
in my cold @-@ hearted daughter @-@ in @-@ law ,
that she might show some shred of mercy to me ,
her wretched captive .
amen .
mother , may i remind you ,
you asked to come here .
i didn &apos;t know i &apos;d be trading one jail for another .
at least at the home you could
bribe the orderlies to smuggle things in .
but here , nothing gets past the commandant .
i have done everything i can to
make you happy and comfortable .
what do you want from us ?
i want my freedom .
i want out of this perky little gulag
and into a house i can call my own .
and you &apos;re going to buy it for me .
i can &apos;t afford to buy you a house .
you can &apos;t afford not to .
i know a house won &apos;t be easy to swing ,
but how many more of these edward albee dinners
do you want to sit through ?
what did she mean by &quot; you can &apos;t afford not to &quot; ?
was she threatening you with something ?
yes , she &apos;s threatening to make us miserable till we cave .
look , at least see if edie has any cheap listings .
we &apos;ll be happier . my mother will be happier .
she &apos;ll take terrible care of herself
and be dead in a year .
you just stole my next argument .
ok , you &apos;ve got enough money
to pay either the phone or the cable bill , but not both .
hello ? mike ?
i &apos;m trying to help you here .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . do whatever you want .
fine . cable it is .
nobody calls you , anyway .
what do you want ?
my toilet &apos;s clogged .
i thought maybe you could fix it .
oh , wait . you can &apos;t , can you ?
because you don &apos;t have any tools .
must be tough being a plumber without tools .
why don &apos;t you people leave me the hell alone ?
jeez . you sure are hostile for a guy
who makes his living in a service industry .
it just occurred to me ,
there &apos;s no point paying the cable bill
if you &apos;re not gonna have electricity .
so ... i &apos;m thinking , pay the electricity up front
and send a check to the phone company ...
where have you been ? they &apos;re all waiting .
i &apos;m here to teach fashion .
i &apos;m fashionably late .
cute . now remember ,
these mothers have refinanced their trailers
in order to pay for this ,
so when you make your entrance ,
for god &apos;s sake , sparkle .
in addition to three vogue covers ,
you may remember her as the face of la roque cosmetics .
please welcome miss gabrielle marquez !
vern ? a moment .
is there a problem ?
yes ! what am i supposed to do with that petting zoo ?
not everyone wins the genetic lottery like you did .
these girls need help
finding the promised land of beauty and style .
please , gabrielle .
be their moses .
good comparison
because it &apos;s gonna take a miracle to turn these mutts into show dogs .
hey , girls . let &apos;s talk beauty .
what &apos;s up , brother ?
i &apos;m sorry . you are ... ?
carlos , from down the street .
we were only best friends , dude .
well , things have been a little fuzzy since the accident .
i &apos;m sorry that i hadn &apos;t come by sooner ,
but my divorce has been kicking my ass .
sorry to hear that .
anyway , i got a new condo ,
but it &apos;s getting renovated .
so i was thinking , maybe i could crash here ?
here ?
yeah .
i could help you out around the house .
free you up to focus on job one ,
getting better .
because you &apos;re tossing it to edie now , right ?
that &apos;s a real relationship killer ,
needing your lady to hoist you off the can .
how long we talking ?
couple months .
three at the most .
and of course , i can kick in for half the utilities and rent .
well , how can i say no to my best friend ?
can you do a kick @-@ flip ?
what are the blake kids
doing all the way over here ?
pam needs to keep a closer eye on them .
will you please come away from that window ?
you barely slept last night .
come on , take a nap .
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine .
hold on .
hey . what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;ve been meaning to get this back to you .
and to thank you .
rebecca and i really enjoyed the cake .
oh , good .
so ... bye .
so , what &apos;d you think of our place ?
sorry ?
i heard you were good friends with the young family .
it must &apos;ve been weird being in there with all the new furniture .
i didn &apos;t notice .
well , how about the kitchen ?
rebecca likes the color ,
but i &apos;m not so sure .
oh , sorry . never made it past the living room .
what ? come on .
you &apos;re in an empty house ,
curious about your new neighbors ,
you look around .
we all do it .
well , i don &apos;t .
well , next time you &apos;re over
i &apos;ll have to give you the tour .
great .
mr. protector man !
hey , hey . not now , parker .
i just wanted to see if i can
play his pinball machine again !
i guess there &apos;s no need for that tour .
girls , first things first .
if you can &apos;t walk , you can &apos;t win .
hit it , vern .
remember , eyes forward , shoulders back , hips square .
look left , look right , whip and walk .
yes , i &apos;m unbelievable . close your mouths .
ok , stop , stop .
what ?
my eyes were forward , my hips were square .
but where &apos;s your confidence , where &apos;s your pride ?
come on . what do i have to be proud of ?
have you guys ever seen a runway model
without the hot clothes and makeup ?
well , trust me , they &apos;re not that special .
but the one thing that they do have is attitude .
you have to believe in yourself .
and if not ,
pretend to believe in yourself , ok ?
all right .
now i want you to pretend you &apos;re on the runway .
flashbulbs are popping .
everyone &apos;s looking at you , envying you ,
and they &apos;re all thinking the same thing :
isabel horowitz is smoking hot !
go , isabel ! go !
you &apos;re doing it , isabel , you &apos;re doing it !
that &apos;s it ! keep going !
i was walking !
you were totally walking ! good job !
all right , donna , you &apos;re next .
get up there and make me hate your beauty .
now , this place is a real diamond in the rough .
a cozy little two @-@ bedroom plus den
with a highly @-@ motivated seller .
oh , look , a highly motivated cockroach .
let &apos;s try to be positive , people .
it &apos;s a fabulous location ,
just walking distance to all sorts of fun shops .
right , from here i can see
a bail bondsman and an adult bookshop .
what do you expect in your price range ,
tara ?
let &apos;s go . thank you .
wait .
i &apos;m not an impractical woman .
i know that my son &apos;s resources are ,
like his achievements , rather limited .
i want to see the rest of it .
ok .
now the lighting in the kitchen is a bit harsh .
the previous owner ...
well , let &apos;s just say
he ran some sort of home @-@ based medical business .
you cannot let her move into this neighborhood .
it &apos;s filled with junkies and whores !
we &apos;ll owe them an apology .
who cares ? she likes it .
of course she likes .
there &apos;s a 24 @-@ hour liquor store across the street .
she wants a house .
this is the best we can afford without bankrupting ourselves .
orson , what if something should happen to her ?
stop worrying about her ! worry about us .
you realize how much we &apos;ve fought since she came ?
the woman &apos;s ruined every relationship that &apos;s mattered to me ,
and she &apos;s doing it again !
oh , my god !
are you all right ?
mother !
just a little spill .
her cane hit a loose tile .
is anything broken ?
well , obviously the damn floor !
we &apos;ll need that fixed before she moves in .
are you insane ?
she obviously can &apos;t be on her own .
it &apos;s a loose tile .
i &apos;m perfectly fine .
and what if you weren &apos;t ?
what if she &apos;d broken something
and was lying here for hours ?
you are coming home with us .
bree .
and i will not hear another word on the subject .
i can &apos;t believe you bought us pizza .
well , you guys earned it .
but eat fast because we only have one hour left ,
and i want to introduce you to your new best friend ,
mr. spray tan .
you know so much cool stuff .
can &apos;t you come back another day ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
please !
you have to !
well , let me check my book .
i might have to move some stuff around ,
but i think i can swing it .
your life must be so exciting , huh ?
yeah . every day &apos;s a parade .
so , what was it like being a famous model ?
honestly , it was like any other job ,
except the pay was great ,
the clothes were couture ,
and the parties were just this side of gomorrah .
you don &apos;t know what gomorrah means , do you ?
good .
did you know kate moss ?
i invited her to a party once .
did you eat pizza with her ?
if you did , it &apos;s almost like we ate pizza with her .
honey , most models don &apos;t eat pizza .
at least not without having a finger for dessert .
gross !
i know , i never did that .
you would not believe
the horrible things they did to stay skinny .
like what ?
well , some would smoke those unfiltered french cigarettes .
but cigarettes can kill you .
but before they do , they kill your appetite .
one time , there was a girl who took too many laxatives and ...
if you &apos;re ever at the chateau milan , in room 238,
do not use the jacuzzi .
do you have to be skinny to be a model ?
well , yeah . when &apos;s the last time
you saw a fat person on a magazine cover ?
now i &apos;m gonna talk to vern about our next session .
you guys finish lunch , so we can get back to work .
hi , rupert .
i went to the mall and bought a change of clothes for the weekend ,
and while i was there i got something for you .
i thought you could wear it on your day off .
do you like it ?
very much .
it &apos;ll come in handy , should my nationality ever slip my mind .
that &apos;s good .
you ! i wanna party with you .
hey , i was thinking this afternoon
maybe we could go look for that drawer .
sorry , ma &apos;am , i &apos;m afraid i have all this silver to polish .
well , let me help you and we can talk .
there is so much i want to know about you .
who is rupert cavanaugh ?
what makes him tick ?
tell you what .
let &apos;s go find you that drawer .
isn &apos;t the master bedroom down that way ?
i realize it &apos;s a bit of a jaunt ,
but i managed to find you an entire bureau .
oh , ok . well .
you certainly didn &apos;t have to go to all that ... trouble .
is there a problem ?
no . i just ...
well , all i really needed was just a little , little drawer ,
and this is so far away and ...
what is that smell ?
oh , yes , about that .
the cat passed away in this room .
did you consider removing the body ?
well , if this isn &apos;t acceptable ,
i can look elsewhere for a drawer ,
when i have the time .
why do you have to be this way ?
and what way is that ?
listen , i know how you feel about jane .
but if you could just give me a chance .
come on , you can &apos;t possibly hate me this much . can you ?
i &apos;m done .
oh , fine . fine , fine , fine .
i don &apos;t need you to like me .
but i think you should give me just a little respect .
i am ian &apos;s girlfriend .
he &apos;s still married .
at best , you &apos;re his ... mistress .
ok . you are not allowed to call me that .
fine . what term would you prefer ?
concubine ? consort ? gold @-@ digging whore ?
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
i shouldn &apos;t have done that .
but , rupert , you have to admit ,
it &apos;s just a drawer .
those drawers are filled with jane &apos;s things .
this is her house .
you are a guest in her house ,
and a temporary one at best .
ok , you know , that is for ian to decide .
oh , he has decided .
why do you think he never told me about you ?
why did he wait so long to bring you here ?
he didn &apos;t want you in that room ...
... where he still keeps jane &apos;s things
exactly as she left them .
but i &apos;ll keep looking for that drawer .
i &apos;m going over to mike &apos;s .
i thought you were gonna mow the lawn .
i know .
it &apos;s just that i promised i &apos;d help him install a shower bar .
and ... it could take a while .
ok .
t @-@ rex . how &apos;re they hanging , brother ?
low and lazy . yeah .
hey , if lynette asks ?
i installed your shower bar today .
got it .
vern , what are you doing here ?
we need to talk .
about the girls &apos; makeup ?
i got them each their own makeup kit ,
custom @-@ tailored to match their skin tone .
and i got melina some wax .
i know she &apos;s only 11,
but those greek genes are gonna kick in any day now .
what ?
this morning mrs. hayes caught donna
with her finger down her throat
trying to barf up her toaster waffle .
really ?
and mrs. horowitz found
isabel behind their garage smoking .
she thought cigarettes would help her lose a few pounds .
where do you think she got that idea ?
those damn tobacco companies .
gabby !
oh , fine , i may have told a few stories about the old days ,
but as a warning .
i didn &apos;t say anything inappropriate for kids .
cassie warren asked her mother if she could
throw a gomorrah party .
ok , look , we have to do damage control .
i get it .
next session , i &apos;ll apologize to all the moms .
there &apos;s not gonna be a next session for you .
the moms don &apos;t want you anywhere near their daughters .
but i &apos;m helping them ! they love me !
wait , please , vern , you have to give me a chance to fix this !
it &apos;s too late , gabby .
you are now officially a bad influence .
well , see you at spin class .
mom said we couldn &apos;t leave .
i &apos;m just going out front .
what the hell is that ?
stop running the ball !
can i ask you guys something ?
what was i like before the accident ?
what do you mean ?
i mean , what kind of guy was i ?
was i happy , was i angry ?
did i ever get violent ?
you were fine .
look , i &apos;m serious .
i really need to know .
you can be honest . you &apos;re my best friend .
honestly ?
you were sort of mysterious . kept to yourself .
nobody really knew you all that well .
yeah .
and this is coming from your best friend .
yeah , yeah , yeah ! yes !
i &apos;m sorry , guys . i just ...
i guess i was really tired .
where &apos;s your brother ?
he went outside .
yeah .
ok . watch her , watch her .
i &apos;ll be back . i &apos;ll be right back .
hello ! open up , open the door !
lynette , what &apos;s the matter ?
i want my son .
he &apos;s not here .
he &apos;s not in our house , he &apos;s not in our yard .
do not jerk me around . parker !
you can &apos;t just barge into my house like this , lynette .
don &apos;t play dumb with me .
i know exactly what is down here !
where &apos;s the pinball ? all the games ?
that was a collection i was taking up for the children &apos;s hospital .
i delivered everything yesterday .
did you donate the photos too ?
parker !
what exactly is it you &apos;re accusing me of ?
don &apos;t pretend you don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m calling the police .
parker !
is there a problem ?
you &apos;re damn right there &apos;s a problem . i can &apos;t find my son .
isn &apos;t that your son ?
where have you been ?
we were at mike &apos;s . he wandered over looking for me .
what &apos;s going on ?
that was the children &apos;s hospital .
art &apos;s story checks out .
he donated all that stuff .
that proves nothing .
he knew i was on to him , he had to dump it .
honey , believe me , i am with you .
there is something fishy about this guy ,
but you got to get a grip .
you can &apos;t go barging into people &apos;s homes .
what if parker had been in there ?
but he wasn &apos;t .
and if you keep accusing this guy without proof ,
he can sue us .
listen , i &apos;ve been thinking
that after everything that you &apos;ve been through ...
please don &apos;t bring up the supermarket again .
that was a traumatic experience .
i think it &apos;s affected you more than you realize .
and maybe you need to talk to somebody about it .
like a therapist .
you &apos;re right .
i need to talk to someone .
he &apos;d gotten rid of everything .
the toys , the pictures , everything was gone .
you can &apos;t sit on this , lynette .
i know .
if something happened to someone &apos;s kid
because i kept my mouth shut ...
the thing is , i promised tom i &apos;d back off .
well , i didn &apos;t .
jane has some beautiful things .
yes , she &apos;s always had impeccable taste .
i know how it must seem to you ,
my holding on to them .
but i just couldn &apos;t bring myself to ...
i get it .
as much as i have tried to pretend that it &apos;s just you and me ,
there &apos;s three of us in this relationship .
susan , you know i adore you .
no , please listen .
the last couple of months ,
i thought we &apos;ve gotten really close ,
and i &apos;ve been loving that .
i just feel like , lately ,
there &apos;s this limit to how far you &apos;ll let me in .
well , i &apos;m trying .
it &apos;s just the more i let you into my heart ,
the more i feel i &apos;m pushing jane out , and ...
you don &apos;t have to push jane out to let me in .
of course , you &apos;re right .
do you know what i think ?
no .
that kind of compassionate wisdom deserves
an obscenely expensive meal .
ok , well , give me a minute ,
and i will change into something nice .
rupert still hasn &apos;t found you a drawer ?
no , not just yet .
well , in that case ...
ian , you don &apos;t have to do that .
if i can make room in my heart for both of you ,
i can certainly make room in my bureau .
it &apos;s just not right . your mother skipped lunch too .
she said she wasn &apos;t hungry .
can &apos;t we just revel in her absence ?
i know she &apos;s a handful ,
but she deserves some compassion .
the woman watched a dream die yesterday .
we all did .
i &apos;m taking her dinner up .
oh , it &apos;s ok . i &apos;ll do it .
no , no , i &apos;d rather do it myself .
i want to talk to her .
oh , well , i &apos;ll let her know you &apos;re coming .
mom &apos;s coming . ditch the wine .

you can kiss that codeine goodbye .
andrew brought her wine .
oh , for god &apos;s sake .
this is our house .

you &apos;re going to learn to obey a few rules .
i don &apos;t obey rules . i make them !

just watch yourself , sunny boy !
ok , look . i know you &apos;re upset ,
but don &apos;t blame orson . it &apos;s not his fault .
it &apos;s all his fault !
you think he &apos;s so wonderful .
you don &apos;t know the half of what he &apos;s done .
let &apos;s go . i can &apos;t deal with her when she &apos;s like this .
he doesn &apos;t want you to hear the truth .

can &apos;t you give me a second chance ?
why should we ?
yeah , i mean , you walk in here all clickety @-@ clack ,
perfect little miss size zero ,
thinking you &apos;re all better than us .
we all saw the look on your face when you showed up .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m better than you .
hell , i envy you .

no , it &apos;s true .
you have husbands and families
and a reason to wake up in the morning .
what do i have ? him !
teaching your kids about confidence and beauty
is the most useful thing i &apos;ve done since ...
i don &apos;t know when .
and as much as i &apos;ve helped them ,
they &apos;ve helped me so much more .
so please , i need this .
and i promise ,
no more talk about dodgy weight loss methods .
like the highly @-@ effective
non @-@ fda @-@ approved diet pill
i can get from my friends in zurich ...
... in bulk .
well , i suppose the christian thing would be to forgive her .
well , why don &apos;t you ladies talk it over
and i &apos;m gonna work on posture with the girls .
yeah ! come on .
come on , you guys , let &apos;s go !
yes !
oh , thank god .
i &apos;ve been driving around all night , looking for you .
we saw that woman at the morgue on our wedding night .
you pretended not to know her .
bree , i can explain .
no . i &apos;m done .
you don &apos;t understand what happened .
there were two women in your life before me .
one vanished , the other was killed .
that &apos;s all i need to understand .
i &apos;ve packed some of your things .
i want you out of the house .
now .
bree ... please .
i love you .
i know .
but it scares the hell out of me .
dangerous men walk among us . &lt; / i &gt;
and we can &apos;t always be sure of who they are
or what secrets they hide . &lt; / i &gt;
but once our worst suspicions are confirmed , &lt; / i &gt;
we can take action . &lt; / i &gt;
once their agendas are revealed , &lt; / i &gt;
we can take steps to protect ourselves &lt; / i &gt;
and those we love . &lt; / i &gt;
yes , dangerous men can cause great harm . &lt; / i &gt;
but sometimes the greatest danger they pose ... &lt; / i &gt;
i &apos;ll take those .
... is to themselves . &lt; / i &gt;
