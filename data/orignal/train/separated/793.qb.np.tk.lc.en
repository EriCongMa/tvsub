you idiot !
dude , my suit cost $ 200,
and mine came with socks stapled to the lapel .
not gonna tap that .
i &apos;m not gonna ,
&apos;cause ... yeah .
&apos;cause it came with it .
yeah , but it came with socks .
unacceptable !
this party was supposed to take me to the next level .
next level of what ?
don &apos;t ask , man .
in every man &apos;s life ,
there is one party that changes everything .
you don &apos;t understand .
and that is exactly why i &apos;m leaving you all behind .
so this whole time , you &apos;ve just been waiting for cooler friends ?
yes . of course .
coach , look around .
this can &apos;t be the finish line .
here she is .
whoa !
you look great !
why is schmidt dressed up ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
prince !
unbelievable !
hey , look !
i &apos;m in a limo !
i wish i had really long legs
so i could stretch &apos; em out the length of the limo .
well , have fun .
i love you .
did nick just tell me
he loved me for the first time ?
yeah .
and did i do finger guns back ?
yeah , you did .
no ...
yes .
you &apos;re gonna want to drink all of this .
hey , driver ,
we &apos;re gonna need some more champagne !
so ...
yeah ...
dude , a man never says it first , okay ?
well , it wasn &apos;t my plan to tell her ,
it just slipped out . she looked so pretty .
well , nick , is that how you feel ? i mean , do you love her ?
of course i do .
but i wasn &apos;t gonna say it like that .
i was gonna wait , winston .
you blurted it out . it &apos;s not a big deal .
that &apos;s what i always do .
i love you !
sometimes they say it back , sometimes they don &apos;t ...
i mean , it &apos;s like a numbers game .
i always do this .
i always get too intent , and then i freak girls out .
i blew it . what do i do ?
well , nick , you can &apos;t take it back .
well , that &apos;s not 100 % true .
damn ! prince &apos;s house !
not bad , prince !
you think prince has a pool ?
you think he has a drawbridge ?
we &apos;re never gonna get in .
we &apos;re not even in a limo .
uh , excuse me , we &apos;re in a ford fusion ,
the best car ever made .
it gets double the gas mileage of ...
shut up .
that &apos;s all you &apos;ve been talking about the whole drive ,
and it &apos;s weird .
you get sexual when you talk about it .
it &apos;s in your eyes . i don &apos;t like it .
double the gas mileage means you go double as far .
that means long .
shut up !
i &apos;ll let you borrow this , dude , and you &apos;ll feel it .
you &apos;ll know what i &apos;m talking ...
why don &apos;t i feel it right now ?
feel it .
oh , cowabunga !
you felt it ?
i &apos;m gonna punch you in the face .
just drive the car .
you &apos;ve never been turned on by gas mileage before ?
never .
no !
once .
when was that ?
it was a thursday , that &apos;s all i remember .
a thursday ?
yeah .
just drive the car .
i gotta go tell my girlfriend i don &apos;t love her
so she doesn &apos;t leave me .
all right .
like a normal person .
amazing .
can you believe it ?
no , i can &apos;t .
finger guns ? that was so stupid .
my brain just froze .
if the limo guy hadn &apos;t pulled away ,
i probably would &apos;ve done a lasso .
i think you were just a little scared .
scared of what ?
saying &quot; i love you &quot; ?
i say &quot; i love you &quot; all the time .
i &apos;ll say right now . i love you .
i love you !
hi , i &apos;m clayton kershaw .

so , uh , what i wanted to say is , nick miller ...

jess !
she &apos;s all right .
hey , jess , you okay ?
hi .
what happened ?
you had a panic attack and you fell down .
oh , my god ...
which is actually worse than finger guns .
i didn &apos;t think that was possible .
i think it &apos;s fair to say
that i did not handle the situation very well .
no , look , it &apos;s fine .
in fact , i want to take the whole thing back , jess .
what ?
i shouldn &apos;t have said it , it was an accident and , uh ...
yeah , so just kind of clear the air .
no ! no , nick !
this just got very awkward .

i &apos;m trying to push through !
what are you doing up there ?
be careful !
i lost my bearings !
i had to go high to avoid the spiders !
nick ...
just wait for him to finish .
i &apos;m breaching !

jess and i are gonna take a moment
to just be alone .
