i know what you &apos;ve been going through .
go to art school .
find the life that you want and don &apos;t look back .
meet the real sarah salvatore ,
stefan set me up to die ,
which resulted in days of torture .
that &apos;s when i started plotting my revenge .
i &apos;m going to make her do things she &apos;d never dream of doing
until she begs me to make her a vampire .
i don &apos;t know if you remember this ,
but liz and i are pretty close .
i need you to promise me something .
when i &apos;m gone , caroline is gonna need you
to help her move on with her life .
promise me that you will do that , stefan .
i promise .
hey , tony , i &apos;m headed home for the night .
could you do me a favor and check up on the lockwood place ?
carol called again ,
another 5 @-@ martini stalker sighting ,
oh , and some teenagers are planning a bonfire off route 13 .
no one &apos;s called to complain yet , but they will .
see you .
forbes .
i &apos;ll be right there .
hey , what happened ?
accident up at wickery bridge .
driver lost control , careened off into the water .
any other casualties ?
two .
survivors ?
one .
we found her up on the bank unconscious .
she must have crawled out of the car and passed out .
elena gilbert .
where &apos;s her brother ?
who are the casualties ?
miranda and grayson , her parents .
principal weber ,
i know that graduation isn &apos;t for a few months ,
but jeremy just got accepted into this great art school .
jeremy gilbert , i don &apos;t think so ,
not with his academic record .
what &apos;s wrong with it ?
you have a few hours ? all right .
let &apos;s start with drug use in his freshman year .
you mean the year that his parents died ?
ok . so what &apos;s the excuse for the next 3 years of woeful attendance ?
extracurricular activities ,
health and fitness , that sort of thing .
i mean , did you see how scrawny he used to be ?
no , but i do recall the 4 months where he faked his own death .
funny thing about that , he actually didn &apos;t fake it .
we went to this island off the coast of canada
in search of this cure for vampirism ,
and jeremy--
damon !
is this some sort of joke to you ?
no . look .
jeremy has had a rough time here ,
i know , but that &apos;s part of the reason why we want him to go .
yeah .
well , i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t let that happen .
so can we try this my way now ?
we already compelled him into art school .
sorry that i wanted my little brother to actually get a degree .
he will . he just won &apos;t earn it .
ok . um ...
this small @-@ town atmosphere doesn &apos;t
nurture a creative spirit like jeremy gilbert ,
and it &apos;s of your opinion
that it &apos;s high time for him to get the hell out of mystic falls .
to matt &apos;s phone , which is clearly
more important than my last day in town .
i &apos;m here , aren &apos;t i ? where &apos;s tyler ?
he broke up with his girlfriend .
he gets a free pass . look .
i want to take this shot
before alaric changes his mind about letting me drink .
this place is closed for another hour .
i &apos;m making an exception .
cheers .
cheers .
to you , brother .
i swear , jeremy ,
if i get a call from the drunk tank in santa fe--
you &apos;re gonna make your girlfriend give me an std test again ?
that cleared up , right ?
why is enzo still alive ,
and why is he calling you ?
nothing you need to worry about .
hey , it &apos;s jeremy &apos;s going @-@ away party .
whatever you want , it can wait a day .
actually , it can &apos;t .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m not sending you back to duke .
i brought duke to you .
what the hell does that--
i take it from your abrupt pause
that you either had a small stroke
or sarah walked in .
it &apos;s good news either way .
make her feel welcome , oh , and
don &apos;t go blabbing details of our little arrangement around the party .
your tongue functions much better inside your mouth .
matt .
what are you doing here ?
i got a call from the manager of this place .
he needed someone to take pictures for the website ,
and he said you mentioned me .
i mean , normally , the pictures i take are a little darker ,
but normally , i don &apos;t get paid , so thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
you want to show me around ?
yeah . yeah .
look who graduated .
he was ok with it ?
sure .
i mean , practically flunking , missed 100 days of school ,
and you can barely spell the word &quot; cat , &quot; but sure .
he was fine with you graduating early .
we helped the process along .
i &apos;m gonna get a drink .
she ok ?
she will be .
we all will .
somehow , we &apos;ll all find a way to move on without you , jeremy .
oh , hey , just did . oh , look under the cap .
i jacked a little going @-@ away present from ric &apos;s girlfriend &apos;s stash .
put it away , you idiot .
tell your sister , i &apos;ll kill you ... again .
if you really think about it ,
jeremy leaving is for the best .
i &apos;m sure everything around him reminds him of bonnie ,
and elena &apos;s always wanted to protect him from vampire drama .
granted , he is going to art school ,
where the percentage rate for a well @-@ paying job
is one of the lowest in the country ,
but i really am happy for him .
do you think you packed enough ?
the whole point of this is for my mom to live out
the rest of her time here in a relaxed and peaceful environment
surrounded by the things that she loves ,
like photo albums and board games .
&quot; the anthology of shakespeare , &quot; volumes one through 12 .
all the books that she &apos;s never gotten around to reading .
oh , hey , do you mind just--
do you mind getting that ?
oh . yeah .
sorry .
um , ok . um ...
just--
sorry .
yeah . it &apos;s ok .
got it .
why is my mom calling you ?
are you going behind my back for information ?
well , hello , stefan . what a lovely voice you have .
why are you calling him ?
you snuck out of the house this morning witht so much as a hello .
i may be a retired sheriff , but i am still a mother .
what are you up to ?
if i told you , it would ruin the surprise .
master bedroom .
at least tell me if stefan is there voluntarily
or against his will .
neither .
he &apos;s here because you asked him to look after me .
sweetheart , that &apos;s not true .
mom , i heard you talking to him in hospital .
you asked him to look after me
and make me smile and
help me move on with my life after you &apos;re gone .
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s not the only reason he &apos;s there .
mom , look . it &apos;s ok .
needed an extra set of hands , anyway .
i will call you in 3 hours with all the details .
until then , no cheating . i love you .
not to be blunt , but i think dying gets you a ticket out of work .
just saying .
how you feeling ?
like i &apos;m not gonna leave this job with unfinished business .
i have all these open cases .
well , let me see if i can help you close a couple of them .
uhh ! yeah .
this one was me .
me .
also me .
ooh , this one was stefan &apos;s .
oh , wait . no . me .
yeah .
i always had a sneaking suspicion .
what about this one ?
elena &apos;s parents .
didn &apos;t know there was an open investigation .
well , at the time , i was taking care of elena and jeremy
and i didn &apos;t want to drag them through more heartache .
then when i was finally ready to reopen the wound ,
elena had moved on ,
and you and i had become friends ,
and i worried that--
what ,
that i was involved ?
liz , no . no , i promise you .
miranda left me this message
two hours before they got in that car ,
two hours before they drove off that road for no reason .
liz , it &apos;s miranda gilbert .
i have something urgent to talk to you about .
please call me back as soon as you can .
i &apos;ll be damned .
looks like you got a good , old @-@ fashioned ,
sheriffy whodunit on your hands .
you know i &apos;m a vampire , right ,
a big sister with nearly perfect senses
who can sneak up on you without making a sound .
really sucks for you . give it .
damon gave it to me , and technically ,
it &apos;s from ric &apos;s girlfriend &apos;s stash .
well , damon is an idiot ,
and alaric conveniently disappeared .
so i can only yell at you .
yeah . ric left .
he was worried someone might recognize him
when he &apos;s supposed to be dead .
right . that hadn &apos;t occurred to me .
our lives are so weird .
that &apos;s the understatement of the century .
give me your lighter .
what , really ?
yes .
i just decided that me smoking a joint
with my little brother might be the most normal thing
that we &apos;ve done together in years .
look what i found in the--
you know , if you &apos;re gonna go for a spin ,
i suggest you get your helmet .
this is the bike that i learned to ride on .
i just didn &apos;t know my mom kept it .
it used to have these training wheels on the back with lights
that would flash every time you pedaled .
then one day , my mom took them off
and said it was time to be a big girl .
you can imagine the princess @-@ sized tantrum that followed .
oh , they have lights . i don &apos;t blame you .
yeah . so what &apos;s with all ... this .
oh , the box was loose , so i figured i would fix it .
you know that you don &apos;t have to do all this , right ?
well , actually , you could &apos;ve had some serious problems--
exposed wires , electrical fires .
no . i mean being here with me .
you know , if you have someplace else you &apos;d rather be--
i don &apos;t .
right .
you know , this would be a lot more fun if i had some--
top right @-@ hand drawer .
well , look at that .
this is why you are a terrible sheriff .
no . i &apos;m a terrible sheriff because one of my best friends
is the perp in half my open cases .
not till i finish this .
ah , suit yourself .
can i ask you something about that night ?
you saw elena , and stefan pulled her out outthe car .
yeah . stefan , always a one @-@ upper .
so you both just happened to be in town the night her parents died .
why ?
well , believe it or not , liz , i once had a mommy , too .
she died around that day .
in the years that my emotions were &quot; on , &quot;
i would stop by and leave flowers at her grave .
you never talk about her .
not much to say .
she died , old @-@ timey disease--
consumption .
why do i feel like you &apos;re leaving something out ?
tell you what .
why don &apos;t we use your investigative instincts
to solve this ?
come here . check this out .
all right .
so why were the gilberts taking wickery bridge
when old miller road was clearly 10 minutes faster ,
and why are there no skid marks at the scene of the accident ,
and why was the trunk full of luggage
as if they were going out of town ?
something did happen that night .
let me have your car .
no way in hell .
oh , come on . i &apos;m moving to a new town , starting a new life .
i need a car .
and it has to be mine ?
just compel yourself a new one .
oh , god , how many cars you think we &apos;ve destroyed ?
like , more than the average family , right ?
mom and dad &apos;s station wagon .
that &apos;s one .
that suv on my birthday .
katherine wrapped my car around a light post .
that &apos;s 3 .
they really didn &apos;t give us many fries , did they ?
yeah , they did . you just ate them all .
oh , my god , we &apos;re so busted .
dude , just click ignore .
dude , i am .
it &apos;s official .
i am the world &apos;s worst sister .
don &apos;t be stupid .
i am .
mom and dad died , and what did i do ?
i let you be jenna &apos;s problem
because i couldn &apos;t deal .
i shut you out . i shut everybody out .
but i never thought that made you a bad sister .
if anything , it was nice to have someone to go through it with .
when you got better , that &apos;s when i felt the most alone .
that wasn &apos;t your fault . you were healing . i wasn &apos;t .
what , damon ?
i &apos;m bonding with my brother .
i want to run something by you .
is there any chance you can get to the sheriff &apos;s office ?
i &apos;m not so sure it &apos;s a good idea
to be around a sheriff right now .
jeremy and i smoked your going @-@ away present .
are you stoned ?
no .
i &apos;m lightly buzzed .
ahh , ok .
well , you need some eye drops , a squirt of perfume , and half a pizza .
this is important .
ok .
i &apos;ll walk over now .
hide the evidence .
see you at home .
what is that strange smell ?
so i hear you &apos;re leaving town .
probably smart , considering you tried to kill me
and , surprise , i &apos;m still here .
so we can go moodier with the lighting if you want
or feature more patrons or menu items .
no . these are great .
i &apos;ll just send these over to my manager .
whoa , too far .
oh , my god .
totally forgot that was on there .
anyone ever tell you
you &apos;re a really good photographer ?
yeah , but obviously , i didn &apos;t take that one .
who did ? uh , whoa . never mind .
it &apos;s none of my business .
this is gonna come as a shock to you ,
but this is not a good time .
oh , this will come as a shock to you ,
but i don &apos;t care .
there &apos;s a tunnel along the river off route 13 .
it &apos;s dark , private .
i want you to bring our photographer friend there .
yeah ? what are you gonna do to her ?
take her hand , exchange pleasantries ,
standard introductory behavior .
if you want to meet her , come here .
see , that sounded like you telling me what to do .
oh , is this the part where you threaten my mom again ?
because that &apos;s brave .
yeah . you &apos;re right . that was uncalled for .
after all , what has your mum ever done to me ?
well , except that one night--
i &apos;m hanging up now .
so i went with something local .
it &apos;s more noble , right , jeremy ?
oh , trying to say something ?
it &apos;s a bit garbled with all the blood .
oh , there . he said , &quot; mmuh ... &quot;
what the hell did you do ?
nothing too serious yet .
so care to reconsider my request ?
hey , so you brought an entire crate of these .
any idea where i should store them ?
there &apos;s a cellar under the stairs .
you ok ?
do you realize that whichever book my mom reaches for
could be the last thing that she ever reads ?
&quot; jane eyre &quot; is 600 pages .
what if she doesn &apos;t finish , or , worse ,
what if she gets halfway through
and then realizes that she hates it ?
what if she wastes her final precious moments
on a terrible book ?
i just don &apos;t want to be held responsible
for ruining her last literary experience .
caroline ,
let me deal with the books .
no . no . i should do it .
i have probably read every single one of these .
i &apos;m happy to take the responsibility .
i &apos;m opening this .
thought that was for your mom .
oh , it was .
honestly , i don &apos;t remember why we took that route home ,
and i had no idea that there was luggage in the trunk .
what about the lack of skid marks ?
any reason your dad would just drive off the road
like he was trying to avoid something without braking ?
i was texting with bonnie when it happened .
embarrassing , i know .
what about the voicemail ?
i wasn &apos;t home that night .
you really think there &apos;s something up with my parents &apos; crash ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but given the way this town works , i wouldn &apos;t be surprised .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry , elena .
i know i should &apos;ve brought this up sooner ,
but in those first few weeks after your parents died , i--
no . you took care of jeremy and i.
i remember .
poor jenna was trying and failing ,
but you let us stay at your place .
you took us to school , made us dinner .
wait . you cook ?
you really tried .
i &apos;ll see if jeremy knows anything .
thanks .
yeah .
you ok ?
yep . yep . i &apos;m good .
yeah ?
i &apos;m fine .
ok .
sure . i &apos;ll follow a guy i barely know into a shady tunnel .
hey , would you rather take more pictures of potato skins ?
i thought you were into dark subject matter .
ha ! graffiti . how provocative .
this is mystic falls .
this is about as dark as it gets .
about those photos ,
my roommate took them for her art final .
i don &apos;t have a boyfriend if that &apos;s what you &apos;re wondering .
all right . we &apos;re here . where the hell are you ?
i &apos;m here . you don &apos;t see me ?
no . i can &apos;t .
take a few steps to your left . here i am .
matt !
they &apos;re running a little late .
apparently , my mom chose today to tackle
an entire career worth of cold cases .
well , they &apos;re gonna have a lot of catching up to do .
so i realize that it doesn &apos;t matter .
what doesn &apos;t matter ?
doesn &apos;t matter what book your mom reads
in her final precious moments .
doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s good or if it &apos;s terrible .
it doesn &apos;t matter because life isn &apos;t about your final moments .
it &apos;s about the moments that led up to them .
i know .
i just wanted it to be perfect , you know ?
i just wanted--
control ?
hey , look . if anyone can control death ...
it &apos;s you .
i know that she asked you to look after me .
caroline , that &apos;s not what--
i &apos;m ok with it , really .
i &apos;m glad , actually ,
because i don &apos;t know if i would be able to get through this on my own .
i &apos;m not here because your mom
asked me to look after you .
then why are you here ?
well , because you &apos;re my friend ,
because i know what it feels like to lose a mother ,
and because when you told me you hated me ,
that was pretty much the worst thing i had heard in a long time .
i think we both know i never really hated you .
one of us should probably say something .
go for it .
not that .
i called 911 .
you need to get out of here .
what the hell kind of a person just barrels
into someone and then drives off like that ?
are you ok ? what happened ? do you need help ?
i was out walking , and i heard you two .
we &apos;re waiting for the stupid ambulance ,
but he seems bad , like , really bad .
his breathing is--
i think he punctured a lung .
fix it .
what , are you , like , an emt or something ?
not exactly , sweetheart .
oh , my god , we have to do something .
look . i can help , but-- what &apos;s your name ?
sarah .
sarah ? right .
i need you to remain calm
what you &apos;re about to see is something you &apos;ve never seen before .
just promise me you &apos;ll remain calm .
i promise . just help him , please .
oh , my god .
you staying calm , luv ?
how did you just--
did you just--
there you are .
oh , my god , what happened ?
enzo &apos;s a dick is what happened .
are you kidding me ? sit down .
i &apos;m gonna kick his ass .
i don &apos;t need my big sister beating up bullies , thanks .
what &apos;d the sheriff want ?
she wanted to talk about the night
that mom and dad died .
she thinks something else happened ,
like maybe it wasn &apos;t an accident .
then what was it-- a vampire attack ,
a werewolf in the road ?
what else could we possibly go through ?
mom had called her a couple of hours before the crash .
she left an urgent message
asking her to call back .
think . do you remember anything
out of the ordinary about that night ?
what ?
i--
i used to smoke pot in my room .
mom caught me that night .
she said she was gonna have me arrested .
so she called the sheriff .
she was pretending to be all business ,
but i could hear jenna giggling outside .
it was the last time we spoke ,
fighting through a door .
that makes sense .
yeah . i &apos;ll let her know .
so the message was a joke .
miranda wanted you to bust jeremy for smoking pot .
well , what about everything else ,
i mean , the route , the skid marks ?
what about the luggage ?
there was a storm the day before .
jeremy &apos;s dad was planning a secret trip to their lake house ,
and the storm rained them out .
the storm .
yeah .
the storm that dropped a power line across old miller road ,
explaining why they took wickery bridge ,
which had a drainage issue before its renovation ,
meaning the road was probably still slick .
slick roads , no skid marks .
the storm , that was the reason .
mystery solved .
would you mind calling caroline
and telling her she can surprise me tomorrow ?
i &apos;m not really feeling up to it tonight .
absolutely .
i &apos;ll go get the car .
yeah . thanks for letting me know .
just call me if there &apos;s any other updates , ok ?
bye .
what happened ? sheriff ok ?
you weren &apos;t supposed to hear that .
damon said that she &apos;s getting worse .
i can &apos;t leave now , no way ,
not with the sheriff sick and enzo on a rampage .
it &apos;s not the right time .
no kidding , because the right time was a couple of years ago .
enzo could have killed you today ,
and the other day , liv threw you across a room ,
and let &apos;s not forget the time that you actually died .
she &apos;s right .
time to get the hell out of here .
you deserve a normal life , jer .
you deserve the life of a kid
whose only baggage is that
he lost his parents .
come on . let &apos;s get you to the airport .
actually , why don &apos;t you let me take him ?
you should go be with liz .
i &apos;ll call you when i get to the airport
and when i land .
and in a couple days ,
expect an suv @-@ sized package from me .
wait . hang on . you &apos;re giving me your car ?
just don &apos;t crash it , ok ?
ok . get in there .
nice pjs situation . you look hot .
oh , i do not have the energy
to tell you how deeply that disturbs me .
you wanted more today , didn &apos;t you ,
about the accident ?
if there had been a supernatural reason they died ,
it would &apos;ve been easier ,
would &apos;ve been a reason .
as it is , it was just an accident .
it was a stupid accident .
no . you wanted someone to blame .
i did everything right , damon .
i lived a good life .
i took care of my family .
it just--
i know .
sometimes really terrible things happen to really amazing people .
i have to admit , there is a certain amount of peace
knowing i &apos;ll be one of the only people in mystic falls
to die an ordinary death .
i &apos;m exceptionally ordinary .
i &apos;m ok with that .
caroline is anything but .
she was meant to be extraordinary ,
and she needs to know how proud i am of her .
yeah . she will .
you tell her yourself . come on .
lay down on this bed .
ok .
thank you .
for what ?
for today ,
for being here .
you know , i didn &apos;t get a chance to spend
much time with my mom before she died .
i volunteered to write the eulogy ,
and then when she actually died ,
i didn &apos;t even go to the funeral .
you want a second chance ?
write mine ...
only do me a favor-- nothing dirty .
no promises .
i &apos;ll take that drink now .
yeah ?
i &apos;ll be right back .
want rocks , or you want neat ?
liz ?
where is she ?
elizabeth forbes , what room &apos;s she in ?
caroline .
damon .
she fell asleep . i couldn &apos;t wake her up .
they said she slipped into a coma .
they said they can make her comfortable .
she &apos;s not comfortable . she &apos;s dying .
i didn &apos;t get to say goodbye .
i didn &apos;t get to say good @-@ bye to my mom .
tyler , hey , it &apos;s stefan .
you might want to head back to mystic falls .
caroline &apos;s mom isn &apos;t doing too hot .
i &apos;ll call you with updates .
what &apos;d the doctors say ?
oh , she &apos;s stable , but , you know .
how much longer ?
not long .
the hospital says she has a dnr , so--
i &apos;m gonna get some air .
i should have been with her .
you didn &apos;t know .
but i knew she was sick , and i knew it was bad .
caroline--
i &apos;m her daughter , stefan , ok ?
i was supposed to give her peace
and convince her that i would be ok
and thank her for being an amazing mom .
god , i don &apos;t ever remember the last thing that i said to her .
i was supposed to be with her in her final moment .
you still can .
airport looks packed .
yeah . long @-@ ass security line , too .
i don &apos;t want you to miss your flight .
i know you have orientation tomorrow .
look . this probably goes without saying ,
but you keep this shut till you get off the bus .
just stuff that above your seat .
this is where you &apos;re headed .
the bus will take you to a town about 30 miles north of santa fe .
now , i can &apos;t confirm if these are actual animal attacks
or something else , but it &apos;s worth looking into ...
i &apos;m on it .
and , man , you &apos;re probably gonna have to generate some art
to actually sell the story
because if elena finds out this is one big lie ,
she &apos;s not gonna just kill you ,
but she &apos;s gonna kill me , too .
yeah . elena will be fine as long as she thinks
that i &apos;m safe .
and happy .
you know , a responsible guardian would try and stop you ...
but ?
but , believe it or not , you &apos;re actually an adult now ,
and you found your purpose .
so might as well pursue it .
granted , being a vampire hunter
doesn &apos;t lend itself to a healthy social life .
yeah . it turns out , a social life
isn &apos;t as much fun as kicking vampire ass .
just don &apos;t do anything stupid , ok ?
i &apos;ll send you leads . you can follow up on them .
you already went over this .
no one needs to worry about me , ok ?
all right .
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m not gonna have e @-@ mail or anything .
just shut up . let me hug you .
i &apos;m proud of you , jeremy .
hey , do me a favor .
if bonnie ever comes back--
you will be the first person i call .
try to clear your mind .
ok .
think about your favorite memory of your mom .
i don &apos;t know . there &apos;s too many .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok . just relax .
close your eyes . open up your mind .
we &apos;re gonna live in her memories .
we can do that ?
just take her hand .
mom , i want to stop .
if you stop , you &apos;ll never learn , sweetie .
i don &apos;t want to learn .
yes , you do .
i can &apos;t do it .
just pedal .
i &apos;m gonna fall off .
i &apos;m holding you up , sweetheart .
you can &apos;t fall .
i &apos;m scared .
i want my other wheels back on .
it &apos;s working .
keep pedaling . you can do it .
don &apos;t let go , mommy .
i won &apos;t , not till you &apos;re ready .
don &apos;t let go . i &apos;m not ready .
yes , you are .
mom ...
mom ...
she &apos;s gone .
