is something on your mind ?
okay , remember when you said we &apos;d go someplace special
before my leave ends ?
yeah .
well ... was this the special place that you had in mind ?
yeah .
why ?
no reason . no , it &apos;s great .
it &apos;s great . it &apos;s great .
i just wanted to make sure . just ... yeah .
well , obviously you had some other place in mind ?
okay , well , if you want me to be honest ,
i didn &apos;t think that we would be eating breakfast
out of a box in a parking lot .
well , i think you &apos;re missing the bigger picture here .
am i ?
yeah .
yeah ?
uh @-@ huh . i mean , we &apos;re alone , right ?
yes .
we &apos;re alone , right ?
mm @-@ hmm . we &apos;re alone in the car .
and eating in the car
is part of the whole retro drive @-@ in experience
with a polynesian twist , of course . mm @-@ hmm .
okay , look , i love rainbow .
all i &apos;m saying is that sometimes a table .
waiters , too . maybe even a , a romantic setting .
how is this not romantic ?
we have great food ...
we got romantic music ...
first off ...
&apos;80s hair bands is not romantic .
and second ... we &apos;re being carjacked .
yo , keys and wallet-- hand &apos; em over !
okay , just hang on a sec .
is a picnic romantic ?
hey , haole , you deaf ? !
yes !
there &apos;s no waiters at a picnic .
how is this any different to a picnic ?
okay , steve ?
what ?
crazy guy with a gun .
give me the money or your lady &apos;s gonna watch you bleed !
you sure you want to do this ?
all right .
help ! help me ! this dude &apos;s crazy !
looks like somebody made santa &apos;s naughty list .
this genius tried to carjack me .
you sure picked the wrong car , brother .
crazy man ripped out my nose ring !
make sure you put that in evidence .
absolutely .
let me take this trash off your hands .
thanks , brother .
hey , duke .
who &apos;s the kid ?
i &apos;m not sure .
all i heard is he &apos;s a hothead .
needed some time to cool off .
come on , brother .
you know , a bobby pin works better .
you got one i could borrow ?
nah , i &apos;m fresh out .
what &apos;s your name ?
ethan awana .
so , uh ... what are you in for , ethan ?
see that broken window ?
yes .
you do that ?
yeah .
any reason in particular ?
only way i could get someone to pay attention to me .
you got my attention .
you want to tell me what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s my dad .
what about him ?
he didn &apos;t come home last night
and he &apos;s not answering his cell .
he wouldn &apos;t just leave me .
it &apos;s christmas eve .
okay .
what &apos;s your dad &apos;s name ?
bruce awana .
i think something bad happened to him .
how bad ?
really bad .
testing , one , two , three , testing ...
testing what , okay ?
it &apos;s not even in my ear yet , okay ? please ?
this is so ridiculous . this whole thing is so stupid .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m doing this .
blame it on the jets , brah .
fumbling away the game at the last possession .
all right , let me explain something to you , all right ?
the refs blew the call .
it goes down in the books as a loss
and you owe me a favor .
a favor , like helping somebody move a couch .
that &apos;s a favor .
not going to buy a helicopter wearing a wire .
it &apos;s gonna be a walk in the park , man .
check these out . sweet , huh ?
yeah , they &apos;re sweet .
i &apos;ve reviewed all the maintenance and the flight log ,
all this needs is a little
cosmetic work and my brand @-@ new logo .
this is your brand @-@ new logo ?
yep , you like it ?
no , i don &apos;t like it .
&apos;cause it &apos;s the same logo , only this time
you &apos;re wearing a yarmulke .
for your information , it &apos;s a propeller beanie .
and it &apos;s all about
maintaining your brand identity
across multiple business platforms .
but what do you know ?
you &apos;re just a cop .
all i need you to do
is bring the price of the chopper down
to 170 grand .
me ?
your plan makes zero sense . why me ?
because the seller &apos;s a white guy
and you haoles speak all the same language .
you mean english ?
yeah .
salesman at six o &apos;clock .
aloha ! name &apos;s freddy schumaker .
my friends call me &quot; fast freddy , &quot;
&apos;cause i got a need for speed ,
if you know what i mean .
all right , fast freddy , danny williams .
my friends just call me &quot; danny &quot; &quot;
danny ?
yeah .
i &apos;m not going to beat around the bush .
you got good taste .
otherwise , you would not be standing
in front of one of the most magnificent
flying machines ever built .
and by the look on your face ,
you got questions . so fire away .
ask him about the rodah .
what about the &quot; rodah ? &quot;
rodah ... oh , the rotor ! the rotor .
yeah .
this here is your standard
semi @-@ rigid main rotor
with , uh , three blades , danny .
what else can i tell you &apos; bout ?
ask him if there &apos;s any transmitting problems
with the cyclic pitch input ?
any , uh ... how &apos;s it turn ? does it turn good ?
no , don &apos;t ask him that , brah !
excuse me ?
this guy , man ... - all right ,
look , i &apos;m gonna level with you .
my friend sent me in here because he wanted to make a deal .
he was afraid you were gonna rip him off .
seriously ?
let &apos;s cut the crap . what &apos;s your best price ?
for a friend of yours ?
uh @-@ huh .
because i &apos;m in a generous mood ...
$ 200,000 .
wait , wait ...
do you hear that ?
hear what ?
that &apos;s sleigh bells .
oh . old longbeard &apos;s giving me
the thumbs up to close this deal right now .
so i &apos;m gonna give you a christmas special , danny .
i &apos;m gonna drop it to 180k
if he pays cash .
that &apos;s not gonna work , either .
well , that &apos;s too bad .
you &apos;ll have to tell your friend tough luck .
and that &apos;s a shame , too ,
oh , man .
because he must be pretty desperate to send a guy in :
who doesn &apos;t know a damn thing about helicopters .
yeah , yeah , it &apos;s true .
i don &apos;t know anything about helicopters .
but being a law enforcement officer ,
see , i do know a thing or two about tax evasion .
so what do you say , uh ,
make it an even 170
and i will forget that the whole
&quot; dropping the price for cash &quot; conversation ever happened .
what do you think ?
deal .
deal .
all right .
yes !
yeah , baby ! yeah !
what about your mom , ethan ?
she &apos;s dead .
got sick when i was three .
well , don &apos;t get all choked up about it .
we do okay .
so there &apos;s no family
on the island you can stay with ?
maybe an aunt or an uncle ?
no .
has your dad got a girlfriend , buddy ?
maybe he &apos;s dating someone ?
no .
where &apos;s your dad like to hang out after work ?
does he drink , maybe go to a bar ?
look , i know what you guys are thinking .
that my dad &apos;s a drunk or something ...
or that he ran off with some girl ,
but , nah , that ain &apos;t him .
he takes care of me .
there &apos;s no aunts , no uncles , nobody .
it &apos;s just him
and me .
this is it .
this is my dad &apos;s store .
stay in the truck .
something &apos;s wrong !
no .
nothing &apos;s wrong .
you &apos;re lying to me !
ethan ! stay in the car !
ethan !
okay , listen , i need you and chin to get up
to this general store in ka &apos;a&apos;awa .
dad ?
ethan , wait !
dad ! dad ?
is that my dad &apos;s blood ?
is it ? what happened to him ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll be in in a second .
what did they say ?
did they find my dad ?
not yet , but we &apos;re not jumping to conclusions .
i know what i saw .
it was blood .
ethan , any number of things
could have happened in there , okay ?
i want to help you guys find my dad .
okay , i &apos;ll tell you what ...
i &apos;m recruiting you as a member of the five @-@ o task force--
just until we close this case .
all right . where do we start ?
we start with a full debrief .
i want to know everything you can tell me about your father , okay ?
first i &apos;m gonna find somebody who can take you home .
you &apos;re gonna pack a bag ,
come stay with us until we find your dad .
and i can take him over there . i still have two days of leave .
okay , perfect .
i know what you guys are doing .
what are we doing ?
you just want me out of the way .
that &apos;s not true , pal .
right now , you &apos;re our best source of information .
now wait here a second .
okay .
this makes it official .
now , all you got to do
is hit this , then tap the five @-@ o tile
to get a direct line to me and my team .
so it &apos;s like the bat signal .
yeah .
that is what it is like .
it &apos;s like the bat signal and as soon as we know
something about your dad , you &apos;re our first call .
let &apos;s move .
i like this kid .
of course you do .
he &apos;s you at 13 .
hpd has not found any witnesses .
yeah , no kidding .
this part of the island no one talks to cops .
crime techs recovered a .12 gauge shotgun
from behind that row of canned goods there .
was the shotgun registered ?
no , of course not . sending it to the lab for processing .
i &apos;m thinking that weapon will be consistent with this spatter .
okay , the shooter , he takes a shot ,
dumps the gun , takes off .
the victim , well , he &apos;s alive ,
so maybe he goes and tries to get help ?
well , maybe . here &apos;s the part i don &apos;t get .
check it out .
drag marks ?
yeah .
all right , so either our shooter or somebody , uh ,
takes our victim out of here .
general store , remote location ,
makes you think this could be a robbery gone bad , right ?
then there &apos;s this .
why take the body and leave the cash ?
i miss you , too , monkey , very much .
listen , i got good news .
i am gonna keep all the presents that santa brings you
and you can have them when you come home , okay ?
all right , i love you , too .
bye .
she did this on purpose .
i swear she did it on purpose .
rachel-- she picks this week
to go visit stan in vegas , and me like an idiot ,
i say , &quot; yeah , you can take grace with you . &quot;
why would you do that ?
i don &apos;t know why
i did that . like i said , i &apos;m an idiot .
maybe i thought that a little goodwill
would go a long way in this upcoming custody hearing .
this will be the first christmas that i have not spent with grace .
i am not okay with it .
when is she coming back ?
not soon enough .
you &apos;re coming to my house .
mom &apos;s making christmas dinner .
well , she &apos;s unpacking it and reheating it .
all right , um , i appreciate it very much ,
but i do have plans .
you have plans ?
yes , i have plans . what did i just say ?
you said you have plans .
i do .
sitting on the couch
with a pizza watching miracle on 34th street--
that &apos;s not plans .
but christmas with the mcgarretts
is something you can &apos;t miss .
that &apos;s right .
yeah , i &apos;m just curious .
what do you guys do ?
you give out subscriptions to guns &amp; ammo , huh ?
grenades as stocking stuffers ?
catherine &apos;s gonna be there , too , danny .
i &apos;m gonna save a place for you at that table ; it &apos;s a done deal .
okay , as your friend .
i &apos;ll try not to kill myself .
kono ?
the lab got a hit off a print pulled from the shotgun .
the print matches a guy named moku bradford .
he &apos;s got priors .
he did an 18 @-@ month bid for aggravated assault .
sounds like the kind of guy
who would have an unregistered shotgun .
莫库 · 布拉福德屋子
that look like blood to you ?
yeah , what do you think ?
i think we &apos;re in the right place .
hold it right there . moku bradford ,
drop the shovel right now .
he &apos;s got blood on him , steve .
okay , look , we got people searching the jungle right now .
eventually , they are going to find that body .
you cooperate with us now , small chance you won &apos;t spend
the rest of your life in prison .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
really ? you come walking out of the forest
covered in blood ; you &apos;re carrying a shovel .
all right , it &apos;s pretty obvious
you just buried the guy you shot last night .
hold up . you think i shot someone ?
no , no , we don &apos;t think .
we &apos;re pretty positive .
we got your prints all over the shotgun
we found in bruce awana &apos;s store .
wait , wait , wait , wait , guys .
did something happen to bruce ?
hey , guys , over here .
here , give me that .
tell him i think we found the body .
why didn &apos;t you tell me
you had an imu dug out there .
a what ? i &apos;m sorry . what &apos;s an imu ?
it &apos;s an underground pit used to slow @-@ roast a pig .
okay , all right , uh , hold on a second .
you &apos;re making kalua pig ?
that &apos;s what you &apos;re hiding ?
that &apos;s pig juice and stuff you got on your face ?
yeah .
look , man , i &apos;ve been
sent up for hunting without a license before .
i can &apos;t afford no more fines .
all right , what about bruce ?
you know anything about his disappearance ?
i don &apos;t know nothing about that .
bruce is my friend , okay ?
i work for the dude .
how do you explain your prints
all over remington shotgun
that we found in his store ?
look , that piece belongs to bruce .
okay , but ...
but i &apos;m not saying i never
checked it out a few times .
why would bruce need a gun ?
this isn &apos;t a high @-@ crime area .
would he have any reason to fear for his safety ?
i don &apos;t know .
i figured bruce had his reasons .
but that &apos;s his business , not mine .
i &apos;m sorry about the pig juice , brah .
so , what are you guys ,
like , boyfriend and girlfriend ?
i guess you could say that .
how come you &apos;re not married ?
you sound like my mother .
coming in .
whoa , there , cowboy .
that &apos;s a lot of bbs there .
yeah , well , your boyfriend said i could help .
yes , but ... not like this .
okay .
where are your clothes ?
over there .
oh , we &apos;re gonna need a suitcase .
there &apos;s one in the basement ,
but i &apos;m good with just a shopping bag .
a shopping bag ?
i think we can do better than a shopping bag .
where &apos;s the basement ?
what are you waiting for ?
i mean , i can &apos;t go down there .
i hurt my knee playing soccer .
so ...
yeah , i &apos;ll just use a shopping bag .
yeah , you know what ?
i don &apos;t trust these stairs anyway .
they look a little old to me .
so maybe it &apos;s better you just stay up here .
yeah .
it should be on your left .
did you find a suitcase yet ?
uh , ethan , would you mind finding me a flashlight ?
it &apos;s pretty dark down here .
steve , there must be , like , 20 , 30,000 here .
i mean , it &apos;s just stashed in the suitcase .
guy with a general store on a remote part of the island--
no way he &apos;s coming up with that kind of cash .
maybe bruce got himself
wrapped up in something dirty .
and maybe that something got him killed .
cath , looks like kono &apos;s got a lead .
i &apos;ll call you back .
all right , so i got this security footage
from a local hospital after checking to see
if they had any gunshot victims
that were admitted recently .
last night , there was an anonymous drop @-@ off
at the emergency room .
there .
that &apos;s our gunshot victim .
that &apos;s not bruce awana .
no , but his dna sample matches the blood found
at the general store .
okay , who is he ?
he &apos;s a john doe that died during surgery .
a @-@ ha , so a mystery on top of a mystery .
all right , what about the driver ?
he never turns around ,
so there &apos;s no way to id him .
this is fun so far .
you having fun ?
there &apos;s more .
when i ran the plates ,
guess whose name is on the pink slip .
bruce awana .
okay , so looks like bruce is not
&quot; father of the year &quot; after all .
no .
more like our primary suspect .
gentlemen ,
even with your rudimentary understanding of pathology ,
you can probably tell by the condition of the body
that the cod was a shotgun blast .
okay , let &apos;s just put aside
your lack of social skills for one second .
how are we gonna id this guy ?
his prints and dna are not in the system .
kidneys .
okay , i &apos;ll bite .
are those crystals ?
indeed . oxalate crystals to be exact .
they were taken from the right kidney .
okay , is that it ?
should we expect a further long @-@ winded explanation ?
antifreeze poisoning .
what ?
i was foregoing your &quot; long @-@ winded explanation . &quot;
okay , so crystals formulate in the kidneys
when antifreeze is ingested .
so , what , this guy was shot and poisoned ?
that is my bottom line . additionally ...
see ? &quot; additionally &quot;
i knew it .
the term &quot; short and sweet &quot; is a meaningless phrase to you ,
obviously , but continue .
as i was saying ,
i was able to retrieve some residue
from beneath the victim &apos;s fingernails ,
and was later able to identify them as tea leaves .
chamomile or earl grey ?
neither , because they &apos;re from the tea plant .
they are indigenous to hawaii
and are traditionally utilized to make ceremonial leis , capes ,
and sometimes even cooking utensils .
i think i have an idea of what &apos;s going on here .
really ?
yeah . i think this guy was sampling his own product .
what was that , radiator fluid ?
no . moonshine .
okay , i see an albino kid playing the banjo ,
we &apos;re out of here , okay ?
excuse me .
hey , uncle .
what you thinking , bringing da kine cop to this place ?
uncle , i &apos;m a cop .
yeah , but you &apos;re family .
how many , uh , uncles you got , buddy ?
uncle choi .
hi . danny williams .
eh , don &apos;t , don &apos;t ... it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;ve been making okolehao
since chin was in diapers .
that &apos;s hawaiian for white lightning .
old family recipe .
very popular around the holidays .
the key is in root of tea leaf .
that @-@ that &apos;s good . sounds delicious .
actually , it is , but it &apos;s not for the weak of heart .
uncle ,
we &apos;re here because
we &apos;re working a homicide of a suspected bootlegger .
we found antifreeze in his system ,
and i heard that sometimes these guys
use radiators as stills .
is that true ?
amateur move .
bathtub cook .
those guys only care about ... making a dollar .
on the house .
merry christmas .
no , thank you-- um , i like eggnog this time of year ,
and , uh , voluntarily burning a hole in my stomach
is not on my bucket list , this year , anyway .
okay , we &apos;re on duty ,
so maybe next time .
but there is one more thing .
do you happen to know this guy ?
sorry .
i don &apos;t mix with the lowlifes that sell bad hooch .
i know where you can get it , though ,
if you &apos;re that desperate .
yeah , where @-@ where is that ?
word is there &apos;s a general store out in ka &apos;a&apos;awa .
okay . all right . thank you , uncle .
go easy .
all right , bruce is selling moonshine out of his store .
yeah . maybe he was in business with our john doe ,
they got into a beef and the deal goes south .
right , and bruce shoots mr. doe ,
does an er body dump , takes off .
okay . it &apos;s a good theory .
now we just got to prove it .
how &apos;s he holding up ?
uh , well , he hasn &apos;t thrown anything
through a window yet , so ...
all right , just say it .
we , uh ... we still need an id on the vic ,
and as it stands ,
ethan &apos;s our best chance of getting one .
and what makes you think he knows who our victim is ?
his dad had a side business
hustling moonshine out the back door .
okay , maybe ethan can recognize
one of his dad &apos;s business partners ,
and if he can , maybe we can get a lead
on bruce &apos;s whereabouts .
wait . just think about this for a second , steve .
you want ethan to possibly implicate
his own father in a crime .
or you could look at it
as ethan helping us id a murder vic .
and next you &apos;ll want him to testify .
that &apos;s a possibility , yeah .
but he &apos;d have to live with that for the rest of his life .
what &apos;s the alternative , cath ?
i don &apos;t like this any more than you do ,
but if this kid &apos;s dad is involved ,
he &apos;s gonna find out sooner or later , okay ?
and what are we supposed to do , keep lying to the kid ?
okay , i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll do it .
just ... let me talk to him .
okay . you sure ?
yeah , yeah . um , just give us some space , okay ?
yeah . okay .
ethan ?
you guys were talking about me ,
weren &apos;t you ?
you want a juice or something ?
uh , we got a machine in the hallway-- my treat .
you don &apos;t have to bribe me .
just ... say what you &apos;re gonna say .
okay .
we need your help .
okay ? i need you to tell me
if you recognize this man from your dad &apos;s store .
that man &apos;s dead , isn &apos;t he ?
yeah .
he was the one killed at the store .
does he look familiar ?
do you think my dad did it ?
we don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m really sorry , ethan .
my dad wouldn &apos;t do that .
he wouldn &apos;t .
i believe you .
i believe you .
can i still have a juice ?
absolutely .
i like orange .
orange ? all right .
orange it is .
i &apos;ll be right back , okay ?
damn it !
ethan !
ethan ! stop !
stop right here . this is it .
keep it .
hey , what are you doing , huh ?
pull @-@ the @-@ fire @-@ alarm- and @-@ escape trick ?
you think i don &apos;t know that ?
you said you were gonna help me .
i am helping you . we are .
help me put my dad in jail ?
how &apos;d you find me anyway ?
we traced the phone that steve gave you .
listen to me , ethan .
it &apos;s your dad that we &apos;re talking about here--
i totally get that-- but what we &apos;re trying to do ,
we &apos;re trying to get to the truth .
i know it can be painful ...
but he wouldn &apos;t hurt anyone .
nobody .
not unless they tried to hurt him .
or me .
now , that &apos;s the truth .
so help us prove that .
do you know this guy or not ?
i &apos;ve seen him before , but ...
i don &apos;t know his name .
he hangs out with the guy who lives here ,
darrin hodge .
who &apos;s darrin hodge ?
really bad guy .
my dad warned me to stay away from him .
why ?
darrin and a few of his friends
came into my dad &apos;s store to talk to him .
they started arguing .
so my dad pulled a shotgun on them ,
and told them to get the hell out .
do you remember what the argument was about ?
all right , ethan , thank you .
you &apos;ve been a big help .
danny and i ... we &apos;re gonna check this place out .
i &apos;m coming with you .
you &apos;re not coming with us .
why not ?
you know why not .
the safest place for you to be right now is anywhere but here .
then i want to go home .
i got him .
okay , fine .
if we find your dad in here , we &apos;ll take him to you .
deal .
deal .
beat it .
steve , over here !
put the gun down .
moku , put your gun down .
relax .
relax , moku . put the gun down .
you don &apos;t want to do this , buddy . put the gun down .
put it down .
where &apos;s bruce ?
you killed one of darrin hodge &apos;s crew ,
and you were covering your tracks .
no , man , i didn &apos;t kill nobody !
but you did just break in to darrin hodge &apos;s place , right ?
just so i know so i &apos;m not losing my mind .
no !
no . no ?
no .
no ?
i @-@ i mean ... yes , okay ?
but ... it &apos;s not what you think .
let me tell you what i think .
i think-- we should forget the whole &quot; jury of your peers &quot; thing ,
and dump your funky ass
in an active volcano someplace .
look , man ... i know darrin hodge . okay ?
he &apos;s my moonshine supplier .
he &apos;s your moonshine supplier ?
that &apos;s right .
so you , you were the one selling moonshine
out of the general store , not bruce awana .
yeah .
i never should &apos;ve opened my mouth to darrin
about those deliveries .
what deliveries ?
it was bruce &apos;s thing , man .
he &apos;d make these monthly deliveries
to some guy who paid him a ton of cash up front .
what guy ?
some weird ,
secretive dude , man !
h @-@ he was a recluse , like , uh , what &apos;s his name ?
howard hughes .
when darrin found out about this guy
and the cash he was paying bruce ,
i guess he just figured there was more where that came from .
okay ...
so ... you and darrin put a crew together
to roll this guy ; you guys were in on it together ...
no . no , okay , i didn &apos;t want no part of that .
like i said , man ,
bruce is good peoples .
he threw me a lifeline when nobody else would .
so when you heard that darrin might &apos;ve killed bruce ,
you went to the ranch looking for him-- with a shotgun .
that &apos;s how we do things on this part of the island , man .
we take care of our own .
that &apos;s very nice . who &apos;s this reclusive guy ?
what &apos;s his name ? what &apos;s his address ? where is he ?
i &apos;d tell you if i knew , man , but ...
bruce kept these things to himself .
so , darrin and his crew needed bruce
to lead them to mr. secret moneybags .
right .
they get to the general store ,
try to take him by force , right ?
bruce resists . there &apos;s a struggle .
one of darrin &apos;s crew gets shot , okay ?
i &apos;m thinking , we find this recluse ,
good chance we find out what happened to bruce .
hey , maybe this &apos;ll help . remember all the money
that catherine found in the basement of bruce &apos;s house ?
yeah .
well , hpd ran the serial numbers ,
and they traced the bills back
to a five @-@ year @-@ old chicago bank job .
so there &apos;s the robber : his name is stuart rizzi .
he locked all the employees in the vault ,
and walked out with two mill in cash .
so rizzi &apos;s the recluse .
he &apos;s been using bruce
to send him supplies while he lays low .
he was paying him with the money from the bank heist .
yeah , it &apos;s like his own personal amazon .
all right , kono ,
see if you can pull up a list of all ka &apos;a&apos;awa
real estate transactions made in the last five years .
easy .
i need the ones paid in cash .
all right .
three purchases .
rizzi &apos;s not gonna use his real name ,
that &apos;s obvious , so i &apos;ll cross @-@ check the buyers
with their dmv photos .
bingo . that &apos;s our man .
that &apos;s rizzi .
okay , so ,
he bought the property under an alias .
and not just any property
but a five @-@ acre compound in the middle of the valley .
let &apos;s go .
i thought i knew every inch of this island .
can &apos;t even see this place from the air .
hey , it &apos;s bruce awana &apos;s car .
someone ran a bypass on the electronic gate .
compound &apos;s been breached .
he could still be in there .
chin , cover the house .
this isn &apos;t bruce . or rizzi .
darrin hodge .
the other guy must be one of his crew .
safe to say they didn &apos;t make it out
with the money they came for , huh ?
let &apos;s move .
clear .
maybe rizzi got the jump on darrin and his boy
and fled with bruce .
sounds about right .
but fled where ?
i will raise you two candy canes ...
and a mint .
i will see
your two candy canes ...
and your mint .
what do you got ?
it &apos;s your call .
pair of nines .
three kings .

dad !
ethan , stay back !
let go of my dad !
everything &apos;s gonna be okay , ethan .
merry christmas .
my kid &apos;s got nothing to do with this .
leave him out of it .
why would i do that , bruce ?
we &apos;re all family here , aren &apos;t we ?
i mean , i trusted you .
that is , until you shot your big mouth off
about me to your pals .
i didn &apos;t say anything .
you wanted privacy ; i gave it to you .
i didn &apos;t even know who you really were until today .
i &apos;d like to believe you , bruce .
i really would .
but i don &apos;t .
you probably told them that i was worth a small fortune
and i was easy pickings .
no , hey , i didn &apos;t . i swear .
look , i &apos;m gonna make this real plain and simple for you .
you &apos;re gonna give me all the money i gave you ,
whatever &apos;s left of it .
dad !
it &apos;s all right , ethan .
nothing &apos;s gonna happen .
i &apos;m gonna give this man his money
and we &apos;ll never have to see him again .
i like the sound of that .
now where the hell &apos;s the cash ?
okay , it &apos;s over here .
in the basement .
in the basement .
let &apos;s go to the basement .
all right . easy .
catherine &apos;s not answering .
she &apos;s at the house with the kid .
i don &apos;t like it , danny .
what if rizzi showed up ?
hold on . let &apos;s just think for a second , okay ?
if rizzi is going on the run ,
he knows he needs some cash .
right .
we &apos;re all over his house ,
so he &apos;s got to go someplace else .
he &apos;s gonna go to bruce for whatever scraps he has left .
yeah , but that money is sitting on a shelf
in an hpd evidence room .
rizzi doesn &apos;t know that .
the kid goes down .
i &apos;m keeping an eye on you .
no , let @-@ let me go .
it &apos;ll only take a second .
get down the damn steps , kid !
dad . i got this .
it &apos;s okay .
give me that .

ethan . you okay ?
i &apos;m good , but ...
how &apos;s my dad ?
he &apos;s all right .

a little slow .
i got it under control .
she &apos;s right .
i &apos;m really sorry .

i love you , dad .
i love you , too .

i &apos;m gonna have to respectfully decline .
i &apos;ll give mine to chin
because i &apos;m pretty sure with you driving that thing ,
it &apos;s gonna end up in somebody &apos;s front lawn .
i think i &apos;ll ask sabrina
to accompany me on the inaugural flight .
yeah ? mile high club , buddy ?
2.8 miles to be exact . 15,000 feet is
the maximum altitude for a commercial helicopter .
