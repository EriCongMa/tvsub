Vampires and werewolves used to roam freely
until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power.
Since then, werewolves can only turn on a full moon
and vampires are weakened by the sun.
The werewolf part of the curse is sealed with a moonstone.
He told me about your ex, Katherine.
You must be Elena.
How do we look exactly alike?
The moonstone is what breaks the curse.
Sacrifice is what breaks it.
The blood of the doppelganger. You're the doppelganger.
Elijah. One of the originals.
Klaus is the real deal.
The oldest vampire in the history of time
is coming after me?
What is happening?
Why are you helping me?
I was alone when I turned.
I don't want that to happen to you.
I don't want to be saved.
Not even if it means that Klaus is gonna kill
every single person that I love.
Rosemary.
I don't want to run anymore
because I don't have anywhere else to run to.
She was just scared. She didn't mean to run.
Yes, she did. She's been running for 500 years.
Go!
I'll find a way to get you out.
No matter what happens, we'll protect her.
Promise.
That right there was the biggest mistake you've ever made.
Come on, come on.
It's Mason. Leave a message.
Mason, it's Tyler again.
Look, your cell's voicemail's full.
I need to talk to you.
It's a full moon tomorrow,
and I found your recording and I'm freaking out over here.
So, please call me back.
Please.
Help!
Now that you've got this back, what are you gonna do with it?
Right now, it's what's binding the sun and moon curse.
If I can figure out a way
to remove the spell from the stone,
the stone becomes useless.
And according to Katherine, Klaus becomes vengeful.
Maybe. If he finds out.
Bonnie, can't this wait?
Stefan is stuck in the tomb with Katherine.
We've gotta get him out.
Stefan wants me to focus on this.
Well, don't listen to him.
He thinks he's protecting me, but he's wrong.
I'm taking Stefan's side with this one.
I'm not gonna let you get used in some creepy sacrifice ritual.
What are you guys arguing about?
Not arguing about anything.
I need a coffee.
What?
Why are you on some suicide mission?
I'm trying to prevent everyone else from getting hurt.
Oh, so bringing Klaus the moonstone
so you can get yourself killed is OK?
Where are you going?
To see Stefan.
You're lying.
No, I'm not.
Really?
Tell your face.
Are you serious?
She took the moonstone.
How did you--
We tested you.
And you failed.
Klaus killed Katherine's entire family
just because she crossed him.
I can't let that happen.
What did you do?
It's for the best, Elena.
You trapped her in the house?
It's for the best. Trust me.
Elena's on a martyr tear.
It rivals your greatest hits.
You should be glad the witch and I are getting along.
I brought you this.
Care package-- candles, lanterns...
and...lunch.
Give that to me, I'm just gonna have to share it with her.
Yeah.
You know, you two are surprisingly calm
considering Klaus will hunt you down and kill you
if you mess up his little plan.
I've been dead before. I got over it.
Once we deal with this moonstone,
we're gonna figure a way to get you out.
Don't worry about me.
Just make sure Elena's safe.
Heading out?
Yeah.
Lunch at the Grill.
I've got a practice.
Then we'll probably go out after.
I'll be late.
Sorry, rude.
You have no idea who I am.
I'm Jules,
a friend of Mason's from Florida.
You must be Tyler.
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.
So, I know it's weird of me to just stop by,
but I'm trying to track down Mason.
Mason's back in Florida.
He has been for a while now.
See, uh, that's the thing.
He's not.
So now I'm playing historical society hostess
to some writer who's doing this book on small-town Virginia.
That sounds...
Lame.
Yeah.
But Carol Lockwood played the dead husband card,
said she was too busy to deal.
Plus, my sister kept most of the archives,
so, there you have it.
What's wrong?
This girl Mason knows stopped by the house.
She said he never made it back to Florida.
My mom's freaking out
and she was on the phone with your mom when I left.
We should get going.
Yeah.
You should really lock your door.
Oh, come on, pouty.
At least give me 2 points for ingenuity.
Do you think this is funny?
Yes, Elena. I find hilarity in the lengths that I have to go to,
to repeatedly save your life.
What did Stefan say about this?
He had a good laugh.
And what did he say
about Elijah still being alive?
Yeah, that.
I didn't tell him.
Why not?
Well, A--he can't do anything about it,
and B...
What I just said.
Where's Bonnie?
I though she was meeting you.
No. She's on moonstone duty
and I'm on... Elena patrol.
And who's on Tyler Lockwood and the full moon?
Vampire Barbie asked me
if she could handle it,
and I said why not? I figured if she screwed up,
he'd bite her and then I'll be rid of two of my problems.
Hold on a second. Tonight's the full moon?
Yep, but you're too absorbed
with your suicidal tendencies to notice.
What?
Sheriff Forbes has officially declared
Mason Lockwood a missing person.
What? Why?
Some girl from Florida
showed up on the Lockwoods' doorstep looking for Mason.
What girl?
I don't know.
But she's sure got everyone in a tizzy.
That's not good. Where are you?
I'm at the Grill.
I'm on my way.
Change of plans. You baby-sit.
Hey, you know, you should get out,
enjoy the sun.
Oh, wait. You can't.
Well, maybe he just, like,
stopped to go surf somewhere.
You know, isn't that Mason's whole thing?
Maybe.
This girl just seemed to think he would have called.
I'm sure he's OK.
Yeah.
Anyway...
Let's do this.
So you'll call me as soon as you hear anything?
Of course.
Oh, I didn't get to say goodbye to your son.
I'm afraid he's at the Grill with his friends.
I'll let him know.
Jules...
Let's hope for the best.
Hey, I'm here.
No one knows where Mason is. He's missing.
You were right.
Mason was lying. There's another werewolf.
His nephew.
Hey, excuse me.
Uh, crazy question.
Do you know Tyler Lockwood?
Mason's mystery woman.
Where is Mason, anyway?
Decomposing in his truck.
If you see him, let him know, please.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
So you think she's a werewolf?
Well, I hope not,
being that it's a full moon, Alaric.
But we should definitely find out.
And what is that?
Wolfsbane.
Tell me you brought the instruction manual.
Tell me you brought the wolfsbane.
Yes. Um, not an easy herb to find.
But this is it.
I have water bottles in my bag.
We can mix it in there.
Ok.
The guy at the hardware store
said this setup was rated up to 5,000 pounds.
Is that more than a werewolf can pull?
I have no idea.
Hey, Tyler.
How you doing?
Still human.
Oh, my god. You're not gonna get naked, are you?
It's elastic.
I mean, what should I wear?
I don't think it's like the Hulk
where I get to keep my pants.
I don't know what makes me more upset--
That I showed you how to channel
or that you almost killed me.
Look, I'm so sorry.
I wouldn't have done what I did
unless it was really important.
It's just that there's things that I--
I forgive you.
So much stuff.
What is that?
Is this a grimoire?
They're all grimoires.
How'd you get all these?
Well, witches from all over the world
have collected their spells in grimoires,
But over the centuries, most of them have gotten lost,
and my dad is obsessed with finding them
and making sure that our family's heritage stays intact.
These can't all be your family's.
The way he sees it, all witches are family.
We're all bonded together by a code of loyalty
to help each other.
So that's why you've been so nice to me.
That's one reason.
Listen...
Do you know how to break the bind
between a talisman and a spell?
Uh, well, that depends,
because spells are unique and very specific.
But, uh, I'm...
sure we can figure it out.
Can I have a scotch
and whatever this beautiful woman is drinking?
Oh, no, one's my limit.
Oh, come on, it's not like I'm a freak.
Just being friendly to somebody who's new in town.
Ok, if you insist.
How do you know I'm new?
Because I have never seen you here before.
And I am here every night.
Excuse me, is this guy bothering you?
I'm not bothering anybody.
Perfect. Well...
Do it elsewhere.
Don't worry, he's harmless.
You know, he's sort of the town drunk
and, you know, when we get tired of him,
We just put him in a cab
and send him back where he came from.
Please don't talk about me like I'm not here.
Why are you here?
Thank you for the drink.
So we're fasting now?
We're so pious.
How long have you actually gone without blood?
I know you get desiccation in theory, Stefan,
But in reality, it's much worse.
Your heart still beats,
struggling to pump whatever blood remains.
And when it's gone,
your veins rub together like sandpaper.
It's excruciating.
The pleasure I'll get in watching you suffer
is greater than any pain I'll ever feel.
It's stuffy,
And I've been in this dress for days.
You want to help me get out of it?
Oh, come on, Stefan,
don't be such a grump.
We're here together.
We may as well make the best out of it.
You really think Damon's in a rush to get you out?
He's got what he wants.
Elena.
Stop.
Hey. Given what's most certainly
going on out there,
I'd say you're free to do whatever you want in here.
Nobody will ever know.
Stay out of my head.
Maybe I can do eternity in here after all.
Hey. What are you doing?
Oh. Perfect timing.
What is this stuff?
Your mom's files from the historical society.
I got roped into helping Mrs. Lockwood.
And by roped, I mean very excited to participate.
Hey. I'm Elijah.
Elijah's in town doing research on Mystic Falls.
It's a pleasure.
So, you know, you're welcome to stay here
and rummage through this stuff,
or Elena and I could help you load it into your car.
Yeah, or I can get someone to pick it up tomorrow.
Also a good plan.
Thank you so much for inviting me into your home, Jenna.
And, Elena...
I hope to see you again sometime soon.
What is it?
Um, Jenna was just asking me to...
Get you to help her with the boxes.
Yeah.
That's a wise choice.
What do you want?
I think it's time you and I had a little chat.
There's a B&B down the road,
then there's a motel off of I-9,
but, you know, if you ask me,
I think it's kind of a mistake.
No frills is fine. I'm just here for the night.
Long story. Looking for my friend.
Oh. Who?
Mason Lockwood.
I know Mason.
You do?
Yeah. He's a great guy.
He's missing.
What do you mean? Like...
I mean, missing missing?
How do you know Mason?
Friends of friends.
What time is it?
It's almost 8:00.
What time does the moon crest-- or whatever?
Not for a while.
Mason's journal said the first transformation
can happen before the moon hits its apex.
Does it say how long you'll actually...
Be a wolf?
A few hours.
Maybe more.
Maybe less.
Are you sure-- are you sure you want to do that?
Yeah.
Mason said it'll diminish my strength...
So I can't break free.
Tyler.
Tyler.
Don't!
Don't! You don't!
I'm sorry.
Oh, forgive the intrusion.
I mean your family no harm.
Why did you kill those vampires
when they tried to take me?
Because I didn't want you to be taken.
Klaus is the most feared and hated
of the originals,
But those that fear him are desperate for his approval.
If word gets out that the doppelganger exists,
There'll be a line of vampires eager to take you to him,
And I can't have that.
Isn't that exactly what you're trying to do?
Let's just say that my goal is not to break the curse.
So what is your goal?
Klaus' obsessions have made him paranoid.
He's a recluse.
He trusts only those in his immediate circle.
Like you?
Not anymore.
You don't know where he is, do you?
So you're trying to use me to draw him out.
Well, to do that, I need you to stay put
and stop trying to get yourself killed.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
Well, if I wasn't being truthful, all your family would be dead
and I'd be taking you to Klous right now.
Instead,
I'm here, and I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
What kind of a deal?
Do nothing.
Do nothing, live your life,
Stop fighting.
And then, when the time is right,
You and I shall draw Klaus out together,
And I shall make certain that your friends remain unharmed.
And then what?
Then I kill him.
Just like that?
Just like that.
I'm a man of my word, Elena.
I make a deal, I keep a deal.
How are you going to be able to keep everybody safe?
You know, I notice you have a friend, Bonnie, is it?
She seems to possess the gift of magic.
I have friends with similar gifts.
You know witches.
Together we can
protect everybody that matters to you.
So do we have a deal?
I need you to do one more thing for me.
We're negotiating now?
Yeah, this is good.
This is really good. It's a clear view of the moon.
And it's private.
And anyone looks up
and they're gonna think we're insane.
Aren't we?
So, uh, what's this mysterious talisman we're unbinding?
Oh, wow. A white rock.
This is fascinating.
Hey, I know it doesn't look like much...
What's it spelled with?
Really?
Help a girl out, she still keeps secrets.
Sorry?
I'm just teasing.
Ready?
No, no.
Tyler. Tyler.
I'm burning up.
It burns!
I know. You just gotta breathe through this, OK?
I'm trying.
You should go.
Mm-mmm.
You should leave.
Not yet.
Tyler.
Tyler.
Tyler!
It hurts.
It hurts.
You know, listen, I'm really tight with the sheriff.
If there's anything I can do to help locate Mason, I will.
He's a great guy. And after his brother's funeral,
he stuck around and-- and helped his nephew and--
Tyler?
Yep.
Mason was with him the whole time.
Helped him through all that grief.
You haven't touched your drink.
You know, I'm not much of a drinker. I should get going.
Oh, come on. Look, one drink.
It'll help me sleep.
To sleep.
You fool.
You think you're clever, don't you?
What do you want with Mason lockwood?
He's my friend.
Well, I'm sorry to inform you
that you probably won't find him.
And why not?
You should leave town.
Are you threatening me?
On a full moon.
How stupid are you?
Damon, how about that second round?
I think we're done, Rick.
You think I'm afraid of you?
No, I don't. That's your vampire arrogance.
You should be.
I sniffed you out the moment you entered this bar.
Along with your pathetic wolfsbane.
See, I've been at this a long time.
And any other night of the month,
the situation would be reversed,
But tonight... is not the night to pick a fight with me.
You've been marked.
I want to help, but I don't know what to do.
There's...
There's nothing you can do.
Tyler...
Get out!
No!
Get out!
I don't want to hurt you.
No. No.
Where is she?
Let it go, Damon. Don't be stupid.
What, I'm supposed to let her just get away?
"You've been marked."
What the hell kind of wolf throw-down crap is that, anyway?
Damon, look up. Just look up.
If this werewolf stuff is true,
one bite and you're dead. One bite.
All right? Don't risk it.
Just go home, lock your doors,
and we'll deal with it in the morning.
Yeah.
It's okay.
You fight through it, okay?
Sleep.
Leave.
No.
Go! Please!
No, not yet.
Just go.
I'm right here.
And I'm not going anywhere.
I'm sorry.
Tyler!
You just can't stay away, can you?
Well, you don't answer your phone.
What do you want?
I wanted to apologize.
Just admit it. You don't have anywhere else to go.
I'm sorry about Elena.
I wasn't thinking straight. I didn't know she had a death wish.
But I called you. I tried to make it right, okay?
I'm sorry, Damon.
And I--I have nowhere else to go.
There's nothing here for you, Rose.
Well, then...
Damon!
How bad is it?
It hurts.
It's healing.
I thought a werewolf bit was fatal. I thought...
It's all right.
You're gonna be okay.
You were successful?
Of course I was.
She fell for the whole...
show and didn't suspect a thing.
Thank you, Luka.
Yeah, whatever. I'm going to sleep.
Wait.
There's one more thing Elijah needs us to do
before we lose the full moon.
Are we seriously not going to talk at all?
Oh, we could talk about how you regret
all you've done to make my life miserable.
What do you want me to say, Stefan?
That I'm sorry for everything that I've done?
Well, I'm not, OK?
It's called self-preservation.
I've been looking out for myself for 500 years.
Oh...Look where it's gotten you.
Yes, I've done terrible things.
I know that.
But I do love you, Stefan.
Even if you don't believe it.
You want me to believe you.
Show me. Do something.
Prove to me that there's something inside of you
that's actually worth trusting.
And then what?
You're still gonna hate me.
Well, maybe.
And maybe I'll see that there's still hope for you after all.
You're playing me.
Am I?
You want to find Klaus,
kill him so that you can protect your precious Elena?
Let me guess. You know where he is.
No, I don't.
But I could help you find him.
For a price, I'm sure.
Let's start with Isobel,
Elena's mother.
She was a research expert.
She found me.
You're welcome.
Elijah.
Good evening, Katerina.
Thank you for having the good sense to be frightened.
Your release has been requested.
What? By who?
The lovely Elena drives a hard bargain.
However, we reached a peaceful agreement, she and I.
Please...
come.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
I've had the spell lifted.
As for you, however,
you shall not exit until I say so.
When Klaus comes, he'll want to know exactly where you are.
You're free to go.
Elena will explain the arrangement to you.
If she keeps her word,
I'll keep mine.
Stefan, no.
Please, don't let him leave me in here.
Goodbye, Katherine.
Tyler?
Caroline?
Tyler?!
Tyler.
Oh, my God.
You're OK.
You're OK.
You made it. You didn't get out.
You're OK.
No, I'm not.
I talked to Caroline.
She said Tyler was all locked up.
So, it was Jules,
the other werewolf, the one who attacked you.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I picked a fight with her.
She was coming after me.
All's well that ends well.
You all healed?
Yeah.
See it's that way.
Rose, uh...
I'm happy that the legend was fake.
Maybe the werewolves made it up
to keep vampires away.
Lucky me.
I'm gonna stay and help you.
Help me do what?
Save Elena.
Protect Elena, all things Elena.
Really?
Why?
Because I like you.
I believe in friendship.
I happen to have a vacancy in that department,
and you can use all the friends you can get.
Just friends?
Just friends.
You sure you can do that?
I don't love men who love other women.
I think more of myself than that.
But that doesn't mean I can't be a special friend.
