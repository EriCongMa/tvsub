honey , honey , look , look .
she &apos;s doing that thing with her jaw again .
poor kid . she puts so much pressure on herself .
it &apos;s an obsessive @-@ compulsive thing .
i have read like 100 articles about it .
where does she get it from ?
yeah , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s a mystery .
i know .
alex ...
honey , hi ! hi , hi , hi .
why don &apos;t you take a little break ?
mom , the test is tomorrow morning .
i &apos;m not taking any breaks .
just a little -- oh , okay .
she does that jaw thing every six seconds .
it &apos;s like the hippopotamus at the miniature @-@ golf place .
ohh , i &apos;ve bounced so many balls off those big teeth .
it &apos;s all about the timing !
luke !
so close !
stop it , you idiot !
hey , hey , luke , go to your room .
go on !
she &apos;s got to eat .
i did it out of love .
go .
look at her with the little harmonica .
i know . she &apos;s like a little junior junior wells .
where did you buy it for her ?
i thought you got it for her .
oh , no . cam , she must have grabbed it from that store .
okay . honey ...
listen . stealing is wrong .
now , we have to go back and pay for it .
cam , it &apos;s so far away .
no , i &apos;m not going back there .
tracy ?
oh , my god . mitchell .
uh , this is -- this is cameron , my partner ...
oh . and , uh , our daughter , lily .
oh , cam , this is -- this is tracy .
oh . &quot; tracy &quot; tracy .
yes .
oh , hi .
tracy was my high @-@ school girlfriend .
yes . yes , it &apos;s true .
i had girlfriends -- quite a few , actually .
i , too , took my fair share of ladies to the hen house .
literally ,
i did take them to the hen house .
that &apos;s the only place
you could get some privacy on a farm .
really ?
what were these -- what were these girls &apos; names ?
oh , well , there was nellie forbush ...
betty rizzo ...
eliza ...
doolittle .
these are characters from musicals .
you &apos;re so gay ,
you can &apos;t even think of real girls &apos; names .
kim mcafee -- that &apos;s a real one .
&quot; bye bye birdie . &quot;
what &apos;s new ?
i got married last year .
th @-@ that &apos;s great .
how long are you in town for ?
just a couple of days . we &apos;re staying at my folks &apos; .
oh , i want to hear all about mitchell from high school .
did he have a beard ?
uh , you &apos;re looking at her .
of course i didn &apos;t know it back then .
but we should -- we should all
we should all hang out .
uh ... no .
w @-@ well , take care .
okay .
bye .
thumpety thump @-@ thump . look at frosty go !
that was weird .
well , don &apos;t worry about it . it &apos;s high school , honey .
well , actually ...
what ?
at our 10 @-@ year reunion , we got a little drunk ,
started reminiscing , one thing led to another ...
you went back ?
i @-@ i think i just wanted to see if i could .
turns out i could .
where did this happen ? !
um , in the nurse &apos;s office .
i can still hear the crinkling of the paper .
after that , i @-@ i didn &apos;t return any of her phone calls ,
and i haven &apos;t seen her since .
you naughty little girl .
well , you know , that &apos;s what happens
when you give me kahlua .
hello .
jay , guess who called .
the hoffmans .
who ?
that &apos;s right .
the ones from the hotel bar in cabo .
they &apos;re in town for the night . they want to go to dinner .
oh , hell . the boring guy and the loudmouth ?
i know . i was so excited that they called .
i don &apos;t want to see them .
i know ! so much fun !
you &apos;re with them right now , aren &apos;t you ?
yes ! ha ha .
and they can &apos;t wait to see you , too !
okay , pencils down . you &apos;re taking a break .
no , i @-@ i can &apos;t afford to take a break .
sanjay patel &apos;s not taking a break .
well , obviously , sanjay &apos;s parents don &apos;t care about him .
or &quot; her . &quot;
what is that -- &quot; sanjay &quot; ?
sanjay &apos;s the only one in class
who might do better than me ,
and i cannot let that happen .
honey , listen to yourself .
it &apos;s just not healthy .
this is my fault .
you see me achieve excellence ,
and it puts a lot of pressure on you .
what about me ?
sorry . yeah .
it puts a lot of pressure on both of you .
thanks , phil .
okay , come on . let &apos;s go have some fun !
no !
let &apos;s go !
yes !
doesn &apos;t this feel good , sweetheart ?
it &apos;s fun , right ?
honestly , i think you &apos;re overly worried about lily .
it &apos;s not like she &apos;s gonna grow up to be a thief .
and besides , at the end of the day ,
who does she learn her behavior from ?
us .
we &apos;re her role models .
like mama always said ,
our children are just miniature versions of us .
come on .
cam .
oh , come on , jay .
give me one smile .
i know you want to .
oh , come on , jay . give me one smile . i know you want to .
isn &apos;t that fun , jay ?
oh , this has been so much fun !
you know , i &apos;m surprised to hear you say that .
you &apos;ve been pretty quiet .
that &apos;s because i &apos;m a listener .
i love to listen .
it &apos;s my hobby .
listening is your hobby ?
sure .
you guys have got to come out and visit us .
seriously . we &apos;re not taking no for an answer .
yes . yes , yes .
oh , we would love to !
okay , let &apos;s slow down .
you &apos;re nice people .
we &apos;re nice people .
but let &apos;s be honest --
we &apos;ve all tried to do that thing
where we force a friendship
that isn &apos;t really there .
so why don &apos;t we just call it a day right now
and say goodbye , shake hands ,
wish each other well ?
oh , my god .
this is so uncomfortable .
no , no , but the beauty of it is
we &apos;re never gonna see each other again ,
so there &apos;s no reason to be uncomfortable .
they &apos;re staying with us tonight .
their bags are in our house .
oh , then you were right .
this is uncomfortable .
this is uncomfortable .
do you like it ?
the recipe called for a cup of water ,
but i used milk instead to make the sauce creamier .
cam , i need to tell you something .
you hate it .
cameron .
no .
you &apos;re right . i shouldn &apos;t try anything new ever .
stop it . i &apos;m trying to talk to you .
okay , today ,
when we were leaving the mall ,
i saw tracy by the fountain --
please , don &apos;t tell me you slept with her again .
did you ? you didn &apos;t . right ?
you &apos;re joking .
yeah .
okay . um ...
i don &apos;t know how to say this , or -- or if i &apos;m even right .
i &apos;m probably not .
but , um , she was with a redheaded boy ,
about 8 years old ,
which is the same number of years since we ...
no !
and she said she &apos;d only been married a year ,
and it would explain why
she was so awkward with me , and --
no .
i know . i know . it &apos;s crazy ,
but , cam , i need to find out if he &apos;s mine .
are you okay ?
yeah . yeah , well , you don &apos;t just tell your partner
you may have a baby with someone else
and expect him to go back to eating
a delicious and inventive meal
like it &apos;s nothing !
okay , cam , but even if he is mine ,
it doesn &apos;t change anything between us .
mitchell , i need to have my reaction .
jay !
they order a cab . are you happy now ?
i &apos;ll be happy when i hear a trunk close .
hey , mom . you want a drink of water ?
no , pape . not right now .
you sure ? you look thirsty .
what &apos;s with you and the water today ?
it &apos;s a dribble cup .
you can &apos;t drink from it without spilling .
i think it &apos;s going to make me very popular .
ay , pape , why do you need these things
to make you popular ?
first the walking stick ,
then the business cards .
are they gone yet ?
why did you talk to them like that ?
what ? i was just being honest .
they &apos;re boring as hell !
quiet ! they can hear you !
oh , he probably already heard me .
his hobby is listening .
jay , you don &apos;t treat people like that .
what ? i should do what you do ?
pretend to like someone you don &apos;t ?
i &apos;m doing it right now .
can i tell you something , gloria ?
when you reach a certain age ,
you want to spend what precious little time you have left
with people you actually like ,
not some bozos who glommed onto you .
tell me about it .
i &apos;ve got a clingy fifth grader i can &apos;t shake .
see , even manny knows .
i got your back , jay . thirsty ?
manny , go to sleep .
can we just please forget about this now ?
and the worst thing
is that you sold me out without warning
and made me look like a fool .
husband and wife are supposed to help each other ,
not throw each other under the bus !
i would never do that to you !
gloria -- gloria , wait !
could you get my book for me ? i left it downstairs .
there you are .
our cab is here .
i am so sorry .
not your fault . well , goodbye .
ay , wait . you left this .
oh , no , that &apos;s ... for you .
in cabo , you mentioned you were a fan
of gabriel garcía márquez .
so , we tracked him down
and got him to sign a copy
of &quot; one hundred years of solitude &quot; for you .
that &apos;s amazing .
well ...
no , no . don &apos;t go .
i really want you to spend the night here .
jay clearly doesn &apos;t .
jay doesn &apos;t know what he wants .
i don &apos;t like to tell this to people , but , uh ...
jay &apos;s mind is ... going away .
oh , my god .
no .
he &apos;s so old , some nights it &apos;s like ...
he &apos;s not even here .
gloria , honey .
that &apos;s it . we &apos;re not going anywhere .
come on .
you never came to bed .
i fell asleep in the den .
cam , we need to talk about --
mitchell , wait .
listen .
i was up all night , thinking about it .
and here &apos;s the thing .
if you would have told me 10 years ago
that i would be living with someone
and raising a beautiful baby girl ,
i would have said you were crazy .
but here we are .
and you and lily are the best things
that have ever happened to me .
so if you &apos;re telling me there &apos;s another kid ,
how can that be anything but good ?
oh , cam , that &apos;s -- that means so --
no , it &apos;s okay .
no , i need to have my reaction .
we &apos;re gonna be okay .
so what do we do now ?
i don &apos;t know . i guess i &apos;m gonna have to --
i &apos;m gonna have to call tracy
and tell her that we need to talk .
okay .
are you nervous ?
i &apos;m terrified .
yes . i mean , what &apos;s this kid gonna think of me ?
i &apos;ve been absent for the first eight years of his life .
i mean , how do you make up for time like that when --
okay , slow down .
you &apos;re spinning out .
it &apos;s probably just a false alarm .
no , you &apos;re right .
this could be my &quot; going bald &quot; scare all over again .
yeah . and we know how that turned out .
honey .
what would happen if the greatest scientists on earth
got together to mate nature &apos;s two most violent predators ?
are we talking about &quot; croctopus &quot; in 3d ?
at 2.10 .
book it !
claire and i share a true love of cheesy cinema .
um , our favorite categories
include genetically engineered animals gone wrong ...
old and young people switching bodies .
uh , tough guys taking care of babies .
any sequel three and higher .
oh , yeah .
usually get a new cast around five --
that &apos;s where the magic really happens .
hey , honey , how &apos;d your test go ?
second highest in the class .
well , that &apos;s great .
sanjay patel edged me out by 12 points .
oh , honey , who cares what she did ?
it &apos;s a he !
sanjay is a very common indian boy &apos;s name .
there are like millions of them .
sweetheart , it &apos;s still a great score .
i hope you &apos;re not beating yourself up .
i &apos;m not .
that &apos;s our girl .
sanjay &apos;s dad &apos;s a surgeon . his mom &apos;s a professor .
i can &apos;t compete with that .
i &apos;ll just have to do the best i can
with what i was given .
good for you !
we &apos;re proud of you , honey .
she &apos;s such a good kid .
yeah , she is .
did she just say she was gonna do the best
with what she was given ?
i don &apos;t know . i was still thinking about all the sanjays .
i don &apos;t know any , but i know three miltons .
she &apos;s saying we &apos;re stupid !
well , she &apos;s ... wrong .
is she ?
honey , look at how long it just took us
to figure out that she &apos;s insulting us .
are we holding our kids back ?
no . we &apos;re both bright people .
we &apos;re college graduates . we read .
i &apos;d go so far as to say
we &apos;re as intellectual and sophisticated as --
sweet ! &quot; croctopus &quot; tickets confirmed !
oh , i just think that we should offer to take manny .
maybe for a weekend . something .
hey , guys .
oh , hey , manny .
hey , manny .
where are you going ?
got a golf lesson .
my swing &apos;s a mess .
manny &apos;s coming with me .
no , you can &apos;t go downstairs now .
you &apos;ll run into the hoffmans .
actually , i want to talk to them ,
because i &apos;ve been thinking about
what you said last night ,
and i &apos;m sorry if i embarrassed you .
you &apos;re right .
you never would have done that to me .
i forgive you !
so i &apos;ll say goodbye .
no , jay .
don &apos;t do that .
first they think you like them .
then they think you don &apos;t like them .
don &apos;t confuse them .
i want to do this for you .
jay , wait !
it &apos;s okay .
ay , jay , wait !
so , hey , how -- how are you handling things ,
you know , with jay ?
what do you mean ?
honey , your mom told us
that jay &apos;s , you know ,
a little off his game .
a little ? it &apos;s hard to watch .
it must be so frustrating for him .
well , he does swear a lot .
you know , the worst is when he goes off into the woods .
oh , and when he drives --
oh , my god . look out .
i &apos;m surprised he hasn &apos;t killed anybody yet !
i &apos;m so glad you guys are still here .
i just want to say ...
sorry for last night .
it &apos;s okay .
we understand .
ay , you see ? problem is solved .
now go . you &apos;re going to be late .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with you guys .
you know , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s me .
oh , we know .
we went through the same thing with steph &apos;s father .
now i &apos;m confused .
i &apos;m steph .
uh , here , jay . i poured you a glass of orange juice .
thanks , kid .
what the hell ? what &apos;s wrong with me ? !
it &apos;s always funny .
jay , go change .
i &apos;ll be there in one second .
maybe we should get going .
well , at least let me drive you to the airport .
no , no . no , no , no .
oh , no , no , no .
we &apos;ll call a cab .
honey , do you want popcorn or anything ?
no , i &apos;m good ...
&apos;n &apos; plenty .
so hold your water
&apos;cause i &apos;ve got some &quot; twix &quot; up my sleeve .
you may be cool ,
but i &apos;m ... wine cooler .
i love us .
thank you .
well , hello , dunphy !
who is that ?
it &apos;s the patels ,
sanjay &apos;s parents .
hey . hey , how are you ?
i heard sanjay did so well on his test today .
oh , yes , we &apos;re very proud of him .
indeed .
are you here to see &quot; deux jour de la vie &quot; ?
well , we &apos;re not here to see &quot; croctopus &quot; !
forgive vish if you hear him groan .
he gets annoyed if the subtitles are mistranslated .
well , that makes &quot; deux &quot; of us .
i guess we &apos;ll ... see you in there .
all right .
you bet .
see you in there !
phil , where are you going ? !
&quot; croctopus . &quot;
honey . honey !
i think we should go see this movie .
why do i have to watch a french movie ?
i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
well , maybe alex has a point .
how can we encourage our kids
to have intellectual curiosity
when we don &apos;t have any ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s two hours of our life .
fine .
for our kids .
sometimes i hate the kids .
i know .
i &apos;m so confused .
i &apos;m not .
i love this .
you do not .
name one thing you &apos;ve liked about this .
i liked the scene with the old man on the beach .
that was a trailer for a different movie .
so he &apos;s not coming back ?
no , he &apos;s not coming back ,
and i &apos;m not coming back , either !
some of us are trying to enjoy this film .
while claire watched one of the most
highly acclaimed films of the year ,
i sat through a badly made schlockfest
with absolutely no redeeming value .
and it was awesome .
oh , my god .
it feels like i have ink on me !
sweetheart ...
what ?
oh , my god .
honey ...
i fell asleep . i missed it .
yeah , let &apos;s go home .
i can &apos;t believe i fell asleep and you left .
alex is right -- we &apos;re idiots .
claire , stop it .
look ...
our kid got the second @-@ best grade in the class .
dumb parents don &apos;t make kids that smart .
she got the best of both of us .
kind of like if you combined
the jaw strength of a crocodile
and the ink @-@ spraying capabilities of an octopus .
you &apos;d end up with something unstoppable .
but they did stop him in the end , didn &apos;t they ?
&quot; her . &quot; and she laid eggs .
croctopi .
yeah .
check out einstein over there .
well , that &apos;s just sad .
hey , vish .
you just do this .
thank you .
so , did you enjoy the film ?
not in the least .
i actually found it quite two @-@ dimensional .
well , lovely to see you .
good to see you , too .
all right . bye .
bye .
after you , doctor .
after you , professor .
mitchell , cameron .
come on in .
um , so ... w @-@ we need to talk .
about what ?
do you mind if we sit down ?
please .
um , tracy , i ... i have something to say ,
and i &apos;m afraid that if i just don &apos;t
say it all at once , i &apos;m never gonna say it .
so ...
this takes me back to prom night .
again ... sorry about that .
anyway , uh ,
i saw you yesterday across the mall after we spoke
and couldn &apos;t help but notice that you weren &apos;t alone .
uh , you were with ...
i don &apos;t even know how to put this .
his name ... is bobby .
bobby .
such a lovely name .
tracy ...
i @-@ is he ...
yes , mitchell .
he is .
oh , my god . oh -- okay .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
mitchell , you and i don &apos;t have a relationship anymore .
i called you after our little ...
visit to the nurse &apos;s room .
you never returned any of my calls .
i @-@ i was freaked out , tracy , and i --
hey , let &apos;s not rehash the past ...
... but rather , focus on the future .
yes , yes . yes , cam and i , um ,
want to know if you &apos;re open ... to us ...
getting to know bobby .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a very good idea .
okay , i understand .
no , it might be a little awkward at first ,
but i think after some time ...
we brought him a present .
for bobby ?
please , we just --
we really just want to meet him .
fine .
okay .
bobby ?
could you come out here ?
hey , honey . what &apos;s up ?
i wanted to introduce you to mitchell and cameron .
this is my husband .
hey . how ya doin &apos; ?
hey , what &apos;s up , dude ?
how ya doin &apos; ?
good .
nice to meet you .
hi . cameron .
hi , there . yeah .
so , uh , how do you know tracy ?
um , uh , how -- uh , we , um ...
mitchell took me to the prom .
the prom .
the prom .
oh , a redhead .
you really have a type , don &apos;t you ?
they got you a present ?
oh ... it &apos;s not ...
you don &apos;t need to -- - i wouldn &apos;t even --
you don &apos;t ...
&quot; li &apos;l slugger &quot; ?
i &apos;m just gonna go and let you two catch up .
&apos;sup ?
i never realized that you ever had sex with a girl
i kind of got around back then , actually .
more than one ?
please .
well , there was tracy . who else ?
uh , betty rizzo .
don &apos;t remember her .
eliza doolittle ?
nellie forbush ?
these were classmates ?
well , s @-@ s @-@ some were older .
s @-@ some were younger .
uh , liesel and gretel von trapp .
sisters , obviously -- too far ?
i &apos;m not an idiot .
you played that record night and day .
