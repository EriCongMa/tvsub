why are you telling us this ?
&apos;cause i want to .
i want to give you a heads up .
you nervous ? you need tips ?
no , i &apos;m not nervous .
just , you know , i can drive stick .
yeah , &apos; cause it seems like you &apos;re freaking out a little bit .
with this whole activity .
that &apos;s not stick , that &apos;s automatic .
that &apos;s not automatic .
another bathroom break , schmidt ?
you know , i &apos;ve been timing you all day .
seven minutes and 23 seconds .
i wonder what was going on in there .
you pooped .
can you stop timing me , please ?
it &apos;s ridiculous that you do that .
i will break you .
hey , lisa ! you were on fire last night , girl !
i &apos;m taking her job .
what did you do last night ?
everyone from the office went to jill &apos;s bachelorette party .
why don &apos;t i get invited places ?
is it because i &apos;m the only man in the office ?
&quot; man . &quot; that &apos;s adorable .
how is it ...
you know , sarah got promoted .
sarah ? with the , with the gums ?
so she &apos;s out of the ...
yeah . that corner cubicle is free .
so much kick @-@ back space .
and , you know , gina personally invited me
to her baby shower tonight .
so that corner cubicle-- that &apos;s all mine .
you like a bond villain ? you just told me your whole plan .
mr. darcy &apos;s going to love my new bonnet .
why are we here ?
you don &apos;t understand .
you &apos;ve never been cheated on before .
spencer and i never tried anything new ,
and maybe if i &apos;d been ... more erotic ...
spencer cheated on you because he &apos;s a total jerk ,
not &apos; cause you &apos;re bad in bed .
it &apos;s been six years .
everything i know about sex , i learned from spencer
or the clinton impeachment trial .
he used a cigar as a sexual aid with her in the oval office area ...
jess !
mom ? !
i &apos;m not listening to npr .
no . no whistle .
it &apos;s terrible !
uh , excusez @-@ moi .
can i try this on , please ?
oh , the starfish . you can &apos;t try that on .
health code .
i &apos;ll take it !
i hope paul &apos;s packing some coral polyps ,
&apos;cause this starfish is hungry .
starfish eat coral polyps .
just pay , jess .
so today i &apos;m gonna show you how to cut your own hair .
uh , i consider myself ...
whoa , whoa , whoa ! what the hell are you doing , nick ?
it &apos;s a haircut ! human interaction .
you &apos;re a bartender , you talk to strangers every single day .
i don &apos;t like when they touch my head , winston .
i don &apos;t like it .
go to the damn salon !
no , it &apos;s fine , okay ?
i &apos;m learning how to do it myself .
i &apos;m learning from this video .
oh ! oh , my god , man !
i was wondering why it had so many views .
let &apos;s watch it again .
what ?
you know , gina , i was just walking by and , i mean ,
i was literally pulled in here by the glow .
what do you want , schmidt ?
i was just working my tail off
at my cubicle , which , between you and me , is surrounded
by a couple of chatty cathys .
i mean , that &apos;s really their names . it &apos;s cathy s. and cathy g.
anyway , they won &apos;t shut up about a baby shower tonight
for a certain vp vp .
&quot; very pregnant vice presidente . &quot;
you &apos;re the worst . seriously , the worst .
get out .
gina , honestly , it would mean so much to me
if you would just let me come to your baby shower .
okay , fine . come to my baby shower .
i can come ? so i &apos;m invited ?
yeah .
yeah , you &apos;re invited .
all right . i saw your registry .
i &apos;m gonna get you one of those portable baby pumps .
you &apos;re just out there in every day life ,
but you &apos;re pumping yourself at the same time , you know .
just milking away . just ...
get out .
okay , i &apos;m gonna go .
why don &apos;t we meet here at 8 : 00 ?
great . okay .
uh , where &apos;s the place ?
um , i think it &apos;s in koreatown .
let me check .
ooh , exotic .
let me see here .
jess ?
what ?
sorry , uh ...
can i call you back ?
yeah .
hey , schmidt !
can i borrow your computer ?
nick ? winston ?
what ?
what ?
hey , do you have my comput ...
oh , my computer .
i have your computer .
i can see that .
hey , i got to cram for this baby shower .
can i , can i have it back ?
i &apos;ve been watching porn .
you ...
i found your red folder .
how @-@ how long you been doing that for ? are you okay ?
five and a half hours .
wow . uh , you went deep , jess .
real deep .
help me , guys .
i have 15 minutes .
teach me how to be good at sex .
i just , i have to go on this date right now
and i can &apos;t do it . i &apos;m freaking out , okay ?
i need all of you to sit in front of me
and tell me what guys like in bed , right now .
what do you want to know ?
okay .
um , when you &apos;re ...
if you &apos;re in the ...
if you &apos;re holding the ...
start over .
when you reach ...
... completion ...
yeah , that was it .
completion ?
no ! no , wait . come on . come back here .
jess , guys want to be whisked away .
they want to be enchanted .
just take your clothes off , jess .
do you think that paul watches stuff like that ?
all the time . for sure .
probably watching it right now .
really ? okay .
i put this on mute , because this girl &apos;s ...
like , pretty loud .
and , um , my main thing that i took away was ,
gosh , that young lady can
really multitask .
super normal . what she &apos;s doing .
she &apos;s a pro .
i don &apos;t know if every girl &apos;s like that , but she &apos;s a pro .
i was wondering if there are any trendy moves .
&apos;cause i &apos;ve been doing the same four for the last six years , like ...
uh , and you know , like , uh ...
that one . and i don &apos;t know .
do you think that paul would be
into , like , something like that ?
what , a little light choking ?
i &apos;m gonna bet paul is into some pretty dark stuff .
light choking , really ?
no one &apos;s doing that .
you know what , nick ,
maybe you &apos;re hooking up with the wrong kind of girl .
apparently , i &apos;m hooking up with the right girl , schmidt ,
because they don &apos;t choke me .
nick is a meat and potatoes kind of guy .
winston and i ...
don &apos;t want to be a part of this .
we &apos;re sushi .
so you guys really think you &apos;re better at sex than me .
yeah .
absolutely . what did you do after you
lost your virginity ? what did you say to me ?
don &apos;t say that right now . you &apos;re taking it out of context .
he said , &quot; winston , is it okay that
i didn &apos;t get my pants all the way off ? &quot;
that &apos;s a true story . that really happened .
i was 16 years old .
and i &apos;ve gotten a lot better .
you haven &apos;t gotten that much better . i used to listen
to you and caroline all the time in college .
it was like listening to a rescue crew
trying to communicate with a stranded miner .
&quot; are you okay ? &quot;
&quot; yeah . are you okay ? &quot;
&quot; yeah . &quot;
hey , guys ,
i don &apos;t have much time . can we get this back on track ?
i need to know what to do .
would flicking be , like , a cool thing ?
no .
no !
absolutely not .
how about role play ? do you know any voices ?
yes . i can do an old @-@ timey newscaster , like ,
&quot; hey there , son , i &apos;m gonna kick you into next tuesday , see ? &quot;
you &apos;re telling me , for the last 15 years , you &apos;ve been
thinking i &apos;m bad at sex . i &apos;m fantastic at sex .
dude , you &apos;re scared to get a haircut .
yeah , i don &apos;t like getting a haircut !
it &apos;s too intimate . what does that have to do with sex ?
okay , jess , here &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna do .
you got a question , just come to me because
i &apos;m obviously the best .
no , you &apos;re not the best .
jess , who do you think , of the three of us , is the best at sex ?
yes .
and take emotion out of it .
no one &apos;s feelings are gonna get hurt .
go with your gut .
especially , you know , nick and winston &apos;s .
no , i &apos;m not doing this .
say a name .
go with your gut .
hey ! paul !
hey , paul .
