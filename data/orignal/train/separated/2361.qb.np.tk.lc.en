you must be elena . how do we look exactly alike ?
you &apos;re a petrova doppelganger .
you &apos;re the key to breaking the curse .
the sun and the moon curse ?
klaus is the real deal .
from the first generation of vampires .
the oldest vampire in the history of time
is coming after me ?
elijah .
one of the originals . he &apos;s a legend .
i &apos;m prepared to offer you a deal .
what kind of a deal ?
you and i shall draw klaus out together
and i shall make certain
that your friends remain unharmed .
and then what ?
then i kill him .
i come bearing gifts.this is how you kill an original .
killing elijah would be a suicide mission .
you can &apos;t do it .
even with the dagger and a little white out cash ?
if you kill elijah , then i &apos;m stuck in here forever .
as long as we keep the dagger in there ,
then he stays dead .
pretty much .
how did you get out ?
i knew that i had begged you not to kill elijah ,
that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;d do .
as soon as originals die , compulsion wears off .
what did luka tell you ?
about your daughter . i know where klaus has her .
i want to help you get her back .
no !
he took my powers .
stefan , we &apos;re late for school .
let &apos;s be later .
stefan , it &apos;s school .
remember , that thing that we keep forgetting about ?
school ?
doesn &apos;t ring a bell .
stefan ! ok , 5 minutes . only for 5 minutes .
good morning , damon .
what are you doing here ? i told you to leave .
what is your problem ?
you &apos;re wearing her clothes ? like that &apos;s going to work .
you think i &apos;m katherine ?
why would you think that ? katherine &apos;s in a tomb !
isn &apos;t she ?
what the hell &apos;s going on here ?
i don &apos;t know , you tell me .
is katherine in the tomb or not ?
what are you doing ? !
how could you do this ? !
stefan , you &apos;re hurting me !
stop it , katherine !
stop what ?
it &apos;s getting really easy being you .
what is she doing here ?
when we killed elijah ,
it broke the compulsion and freed the bitch from the tomb .
how &apos;s that possible ?
he &apos;s an original .
they have all sorts of special skills .
i don &apos;t want you here . get her out of here .
you need me , elena .
you all do .
like hell .
we all want the same thing--klaus dead .
yet here you all are , running around like chickens
with their heads cut off .
i don &apos;t need your help .
and i don &apos;t want it .
and that &apos;s incredibly stupid of you .
do you know where klaus is ?
when he &apos;s coming , what he looks like ?
if you know something , say it or get out .
fine . then i &apos;ll just go to the grill
and have some lunch . maybe aunt jenna &apos;s
free for a bite .
hey , matt .
live band ?
yeah , business has been a little slow .
the grill &apos;s trying to stay afloat .
aren &apos;t we all ?
have you heard from tyler ?
not a peep . you ?
no , not since he stopped by the grill to talk
and i &apos;ve left messages on his cell phone .
he stopped by to see you ?
what did he say ?
not much , really .
i mean ... i think
to say good @-@ bye without
really saying good @-@ bye . i just didn &apos;t know .
and that &apos;s all he said ?
yeah , that &apos;s all he said , caroline .
why ? i mean , is there something you want to tell me ?
yeah ! i--
i mean , no , i--
it &apos;s just not that easy .
i don &apos;t get it . since when
have i been the one that can express himself
and you &apos;re one with a loss for words .
no , you &apos;re right , and i &apos;m sorry .
you know how i feel .
so it &apos;s your move .
just make a decision
or leave me alone .
why is she still here ?
she was free .
she wants what we want , klaus &apos;s death .
maybe this is her only chance .
or maybe she &apos;s trying to lure you and damon back into her web .
i want her gone .
so do i.
but you &apos;re right , she &apos;s staying .
shouldn &apos;t we at least try to figure out why ?
how ? all she does is lie .
look , i hate it as much as you do , but she does make a point .
we don &apos;t know anything about klaus .
she does .
right , but that doesn &apos;t mean
i want her shacking up with you .
maybe we should stay at your place tonight .
hmm , i can &apos;t . i told bonnie and caroline
that they could come over . bonnie &apos;s freaked
because she lost her powers
and caroline &apos;s having matt drama again .
it &apos;s kind of a girls &apos; night .
maybe katherine can join us .
come on .
mmm , burning flesh .
if you &apos;re trying to get the dagger back ,
you &apos;re wasting your time . he &apos;s indestructible .
no kidding .
how do you know so much about original vampires ?
spend 500 years running from one .
so when i told you my plan to kill elijah ,
why didn &apos;t you warn me
that i &apos;d die if i used a dagger on him ?
oh , there &apos;s so many rules . it &apos;s all very confusing .
did you know i would die ?
did elijah tell you his plan ?
did he have a dagger to kill klaus with ?
why are you still here ?
because you haven &apos;t forcibly removed me .
you wouldn &apos;t .
oh , i would .
damon , be smart .
i want klaus dead just as much as you do .
more .
if i wasn &apos;t be honest about helping ,
i &apos;d be long gone by now , ok ?
you can hate me .
but we want the same thing .
and you know ...
i always get what i want .
i wanted out of the tomb .
didn &apos;t matter who paid the price .
of course i knew that you &apos;d die .
she &apos;s out of the tomb ?
yeah . we &apos;re dealing with it , all right ?
just be extra careful .
she &apos;s getting a little too good at impersonating elena .
with katherine still around ,
we gotta find a way to get your powers back .
listen , i want to get the martins on our side .
i want to figure out a way for us all to work together
now that elijah &apos;s out of the picture .
it &apos;s impossible . they hate us .
it &apos;s either win them over or somebody &apos;s going to end up dead .
you think you can at least
convince them to have a civil conversation ?
i &apos;ll try .
thanks . keep me posted .
ok . i gotta get to class .
all right , i &apos;ll see ya .
come on .
elena &apos;s nowhere in sight .
i &apos;ll tell her soon . i promise .
all right .
it was bad . you know , john planted all these seeds about isobel
and now jenna knows i &apos;m lying about something .
john &apos;s going to end up dead on the kitchen floor if he &apos;s not careful .
yeah , well , easier said than done .
i gave him back his ring .
so .
look , jenna keeps asking about isobel .
you know , was she murdered ?
why haven &apos;t they found the body ?
i mean , how much longer can she stay in the dark ?
you think we should tell her the truth ?
i &apos;m saying i can &apos;t be with her and not tell her .
it &apos;s not fair to her ,
and it &apos;s not the kind of relationship i want .
not to mention it &apos;s becoming more dangerous for her not to know .
i just thought that we &apos;d at least hold off
until after we &apos;ve dealt with klaus .
you know , and even then ,
how do we tell someone what we know ?
how does someone hear that ?
look , i &apos;m sorry to put this on you .
but i feel it &apos;s your decision to make .
and whatever you decide to do , i &apos;ll respect it .
i want to be honest with her . but until then ,
jenna and i are done .
thank you for coming .
i didn &apos;t want to .
but my son made a case to hear you out .
bonnie said that you have information about elijah .
elijah &apos;s dead . i &apos;m sorry .
hear me out . we can help you .
we know that klaus has your daughter .
i &apos;m sorry about the way i had to get that information ,
but it &apos;s good that we know .
we can all work together to get her back .
how ?
i suspect that you and elijah had a plan to kill klaus .
i &apos;ll just help you carry it out .
you can trust us .
i give you my word . we all do .
what you up to ?
none of your business .
we &apos;re pouting now ?
are those the gilbert journals ?
how am i supposed to help you if you won &apos;t tell me what you &apos;re up to ?
can you tell me where a bunch of witches
were massacred in this town a couple centuries ago ?
no .
then you can &apos;t help .
if it &apos;s any consolation ,
i &apos;m glad that you &apos;re not dead .
emily bennett told me about the massacre .
it was a big deal in witch folklore .
when a witch dies violently ,
they release a mystical energy
making the place of their death with power .
i think elijah wanted to know the site of the massacre .
what was he going to do when he found it ?
i don &apos;t know .
what did papa witch and baby witch have to say ?
wasn &apos;t she gone or dead ? yeah ?
for the last time , i &apos;m here to help .
can we skip the secrets , hmm ?
elijah had no weapon to kill klaus .
but he believed that if a witch could channel enough power ...
they wouldn &apos;t need one .
like the power you get from
a spot marked with a hundred dead witches ?
we just need to find it .
but what if they can find the burial ground ?
they won &apos;t . we tried , luka , for weeks .
we don &apos;t have a back @-@ up plan , though , dad ,
and we need to be doing everything we can to save greta .
we will save her .
but elijah is the answer ,
not stefan and his brother .
those people , they &apos;re our enemies .
they need to be dealt with .
you &apos;re going to kill them ?
no .
i &apos;m going to let elijah do it .
chinese food or pizza ?
like you have to ask .
i will get it .
i &apos;ll do it .
do you believe that jonas is being sincere ?
i don &apos;t know what to believe .
i think he &apos;s at a loss . he &apos;s not sure who to trust .
join the club .
well , what are we going to do about this movie situation ?
what about &quot; the notebook &quot; ?
caroline , how many times have you seen that movie ?
that is so not the point .
well , yeah , i mean ...
what &apos;s going on ?
girls &apos; night .
how are you doing ?
you heard about my fight with rick .
he feels terrible .
is this some kind of disguised attempt to cheer me up ?
no . no , this is about us girls hanging out .
and , you know , we &apos;ll be here if you happen to want to talk ,
or ...
because i am a winner
when it comes to successful relationships .
you , too ?
you have no idea .
ok , then .
it &apos;s this whole isobel thing .
he &apos;s hiding something from me .
to play devil &apos;s advocate ,
maybe there is a great reason why he &apos;s not telling you .
maybe he is just trying to protect you .
well , that &apos;s not his call to make .
i mean , i deserve the truth . everybody does .
sometimes it &apos;s harder than that .
not if it &apos;s somebody you care about , it isn &apos;t ?
you know what we need ?
dancing . there is a band at the grill .
i &apos;m in .
in .
in .
are you sure about this ?
i mean , i would go if i could .
no . i &apos;m not strong enough to send you .
i can do this .
i &apos;ll stay anchored .
use all my energy .
if you feel weak ... dad .
i want this just as much as you .
concentrate on elijah .
picture him in your mind .
i got it .
i &apos;m in the salvatore house .
elijah &apos;s body must be there .
what do you see ?
elena and damon . they &apos;re reading .
good .
if elijah &apos;s there , you &apos;ll sense him .
stay focused .
can i help you ?
i &apos;m bored .
&quot; emily bennett was taken by the council today .
&quot; they kidnapped her from her home
&quot; and took her to the same location
her ancestors were burned a hundred years ago . &quot;
so emily died on the site of the massacre , too .
does it say where ?
nope .
you know this whole friendly , cooperative thing ?
mm @-@ hmm .
i don &apos;t buy it .
i have no reason to lie to you , damon .
lie .
i &apos;m hungry .
you &apos;re the unwanted houseguest .
go feed yourself .
well , nothing in any of those .
find anything ?
nope .
that &apos;s too bad .
yeah , bummer .
elena &apos;s fighting me .
what &apos;s wrong ?
she &apos;s stronger than me .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s not elena .
it &apos;s katherine pierce . luka . kill her .
what ? she &apos;s a vampire .
find a stake and drive it through her heart .
damon !
katherine !
what happened ?
damon ...
luka , what &apos;s going on ?
luka ! luka !
what are you doing ? !
shutting down a crazy ass psychic witch attack !
get over there and do something about it .
now !
no !
oh , my god ! luka !
luka ! i &apos;m sorry .
please .
just wake up , son .
open your eyes .
luka !
i love my boy !
i need a drink .
hey , matt .
things just got real awkward .
jenna . not tonight , ric .
tonight i have traded you for senor tequila .
yeah .
well , senor tequila &apos;s not going to
be treating you very well .
well , the two of you have a lot in common .
look , jenna , i hate that you &apos;re this upset with me .
yeah , well , it &apos;s your fault .
because whatever it is you &apos;re keeping from me ;
whatever you think i can &apos;t handle ...
you &apos;re wrong .
&apos;cause last year i was a grad student
who smoked a lot of pot
and couldn &apos;t keep a goldfish alive .
and now i &apos;m a parent ,
so i think i can handle anything , ric .
jenna ...
he said the ball &apos;s in your court .
yeah , but i can &apos;t do anything about it .
why not ?
all you do is talk about how much you care about him .
yeah , but i am still keeping so many secrets .
alaric &apos;s in the same boat with jenna .
and maybe that &apos;s our mistake .
we &apos;re trying to protect the people that we love
by keeping them out of it ,
but in the end , we &apos;re hurting them anyway .
what are you doing ?
where are you going ? what is she doing ?
hey , everybody .
let &apos;s hear it for the band !
weren &apos;t they awesome ?
this isn &apos;t going to end well .
so there &apos;s this guy .
and , uh ,
he told me to tell him how i feel about him .
like it &apos;s so easy .
um , you know ,
just &apos; cause i talk a lot doesn &apos;t mean i always know
what i &apos;m actually talking about .
ah , like now , i &apos;m feeling loopy
and i don &apos;t really know how to express myself .
i can sing .
sing
yeah ! yeah .
you know what , i &apos;m going to sing .
come on , off the stage .
you are going to let me live out my rock star fantasies ,
and you are going to be my back @-@ up .
what will it be ?
close your eyes , give me your hand ? darlin&apos;
do you feel my heart beating ?
she &apos;s good .
do you understand ? do you feel the same ?
am i only dreaming ?
is this burning
an eternal flame ?
i believe it &apos;s meant to be .
darlin &apos; i watch you when you are sleeping
you belong with me ? do you feel the same ?
am i only dreaming ?
is this burning an eternal flame ?
say my name , sun shines through the rain
oh , life , so lonely . you come and ease the pain
i don &apos;t want to lose this feeling
oh . no .
matt , i--
you killed him ! aah !
he &apos;s dead and i have no one .
and now you &apos;re about to find out exactly what that feels like .
there you go .
what the hell ? !
that &apos;s for not telling me the dagger would kill me .
next time ...
it goes in your heart .
is that how you treat someone who--
is trying to help you ?
want to help ?
start talking .
i &apos;d love to , but you &apos;re not going to like it .
try me .
fine . john gilbert and isobel want you and stefan
out of elena &apos;s life .
old news .
not the part where he offered me a deal .
he knew that killing elijah would get me out of the tomb ,
so he gave me a choice .
either i stay and help with klaus ,
or he kills stefan .
but he still tried to have me killed .
right .
that was part of the deal .
i could only save one of you .
so you chose stefan .
of course you did .
you wanted the truth , damon .
would you rather i lie ?
ahh ! oh , sorry .
sorry , elena .
you know , i really have to get back to work .
definitely .
i--i wouldn &apos;t . caroline and matt are ...
in the bathroom ? !
if they &apos;re happy ,
i &apos;m happy .
um , hey ,
speaking of happy ,
would it freak you out if i started dating your brother ?
you &apos;re into my brother ?
i know it &apos;s weird , um ,
but he &apos;s been so good and strong .
it makes me happy .
and i really can &apos;t tell what you &apos;re thinking ...
right now .
i &apos;m thinking that ...
my brother has had more pain in his life
than a hundred people &apos;s worth of pain ,
and ...
he deserves to be with someone as amazing as you .
really ?
really .
oh ! my phone .
hey , stefan , i &apos;m at the grill .
i can &apos;t hear you . hold--yeah .
where are you going ?
luka martin &apos;s dead . his father &apos;s going after elena .
i &apos;m coming with you .
no , you &apos;re not .
wait .
i don &apos;t need your help . i don &apos;t want it .
i know what we can do , damon .
you have to let me do it .
dr. martin . you ok ?
where is she ?
i don &apos;t understand .
my son is dead .
whatever it is you think you need to do ,
there &apos;s a better way .
they killed elijah and they killed luka .
and my only shot at getting my daughter back
is if i have elena .
no . no , dr. martin .
where is she ?
i don &apos;t know . i haven &apos;t seen her .
what the hell ?
the power &apos;s out .
even better .
i wish , but i should probably--whoa .
we have a problem .
what &apos;s going on ?
jonas is here and he &apos;s after elena .
oh , my god !
we have a plan , but i need to get elena out of here .
well , what can i do ?
it &apos;s time to get out of here . i have to find elena .
she &apos;s with stefan , she &apos;s ok .
no one &apos;s getting out of here until i have her .
don &apos;t do this . please don &apos;t do this .
bonnie ! hey , bonnie !
bonnie !
bonnie ! hey , bonnie .
come on . come on .
dr. martin ! i &apos;m so sorry about luka .
i never wanted that to happen ,
but ... at least let us help you get your daughter back .
only elijah can do that .
you don &apos;t need elijah .
caroline !
get away from her !
matt , no !
matt !
matt ! no !
matt ! matt !
oh ! oh , my god !
ok . uh ...
just breath , caroline , just breath .
you have to drink . please , please .
luka ...
i can &apos;t believe he &apos;s dead .
after what we did to him .
no , after what he did to you .
look , i &apos;m sorry , i know you feel bad about all of this ,
but i don &apos;t .
i couldn &apos;t do anything to help .
i was useless .
i hated it .
thank god .
it &apos;s not over yet .
what &apos;s going on ?
he &apos;ll explain .
when did you guys get home ?
a few minutes ago .
did you check the house ?
and why would we check the house ?
you &apos;re welcome .
you didn &apos;t have to kill him !
yes , we did .
get off !
how did you guys convince her to do this ?
we didn &apos;t . it was actually her idea .
wow . that &apos;s ... not good .
no . no , that &apos;s not good at all .
everything &apos;s taken care of .
i &apos;m guessing you &apos;re going to want this back .
but your pretty little outfit
is going to need a good dry clean .
you &apos;re going to have to
get her out of here before jenna gets home .
is that all you have to say to me ?
this doesn &apos;t change the way i feel about you .
i don &apos;t much like you , either , if we &apos;re going to be open .
and frankly , i &apos;d be happy to see you dead ,
but if we &apos;re going to try to take on klaus ,
we kinda need you to be alive .
so i &apos;m not a threat to you , elena .
if any of you are going to believe anything ,
believe that .
thanks for getting me home .
that was kind of crazy .
jenna , are you going to be ok ?
look , isobel is dead .
and there are things about her death
that i can &apos;t tell you ;
that aren &apos;t for me to tell .
you can be upset and hate me .
i get it .
but just know that i love you .
at least i can tell you that much .
good night , ric .
good night .
you made it home .
tonight was very weird .
tell me about it .
i &apos;m worried about you .
don &apos;t be .
no , i &apos;m serious , bonnie .
the only witch that could given you your powers back is dead ,
and ... i think you have a serious case of denial going ,
and i want you to know
that i &apos;m here for you no matter what , and ...
not that denial &apos;s the worst thing .
did you ...
when he grabbed me ...
he gave me my powers back .
and something else .
jonas wants me to kill klaus .
and did he include a how ?
yeah .
he did .
you know what i can &apos;t figure out ?
what &apos;s that ?
how the town knew emily bennett was a witch .
i mean , because according to johnathan gilbert ,
he was the only one who knew .
i know he didn &apos;t turn her in .
mmm , i should have figured as much .
oh , she was a loose end . i like mine tied up .
you know what i can &apos;t figure out ?
do i care ?
why you won &apos;t tell me where to find the site
of the witch massacre .
because i have no clue .
you knew that emily bennett
was the key to getting me out of that tomb .
and something tells me that you did everything in your power
to make sure that she was safe ,
yet you have no idea where she was killed .
who &apos;s the liar now ?
you hurt me today .
tit for tat .
you were mean .
and very rough .
and monstrous .
you deserved it .
i like this damon .
katherine .
katherine , there are six other bedrooms in this house .
go find one .
what the hell ?
i had your face ...
and all the blood . i @-@ i drank your blood .
you were dying .
my blood healed you .
what do you mean , it healed me ?
how can your blood heal me ?
because that &apos;s what vampire blood does for humans ,
and that &apos;s what i am .
i &apos;m a vampire , matt .
no .
but it &apos;s all going to be ok ,
because i am going to tell you everything ,
and you &apos;re going to understand why i had to keep it from you ,
and we &apos;re going to be fine .
we &apos;ll be fine ? !
yes , because we &apos;re together and we love each other .
vampires .
oh , my god .
vickie , oh , my god , at the hospital ,
i thought that she was tripping out .
what ?
vickie , she knew about the vampires ,
and i ...
what--what did you do ?
nothing . nothing ! matt !
i need to get out of here .
no , no , no ! i can &apos;t let you leave . i cannot let you leave .
what did you do to my sister ?
nothing ! nothing ! i swear , i swear , nothing , nothing !
what did you do ? !
nothing , matt !
you have to calm down ! matt !
are john and jeremy asleep ?
i think so .
if i go to bed right now ,
there &apos;s a chance i &apos;ll wake up hangover @-@ free .
who &apos;s that ?
hi . you must be jenna .
i &apos;m ...
elena &apos;s mother .
