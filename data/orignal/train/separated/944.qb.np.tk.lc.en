a reporter did a story on homeless teens .
my son was one of them .
oh , my god .
orson found andrew .
have i done stuff for money that i &apos;m not proud of ?
yeah , sure .
and the prodigal son returned .
mike fell into a coma .
what could be more romantic ?
i can think of something .
and susan fell into the arms of another man ...
... a bit too soon .
the day mike delfino woke from his coma ,
edie britt was the first to know .
once she was sure he was responsive ...
mike ?
... edie decided to share the good news with others .
code red ! code red !
my friend just woke up from his coma .
and that is how word began to spread .
mike &apos;s physician , dr. craig , was busy with a patient
when he first heard the news .
not long after , he called his aunt ida ,
who was busy knitting a sweater .
she told lynette scavo , who was busy watering her lawn .
and she told her husband tom ,
who was busy playing a computer game .
he then e @-@ mailed his friend carlos ,
who was busy plotting strategy with his divorce lawyer .
and carlos called his soon @-@ to @-@ be @-@ ex @-@ wife , gabrielle ,
who was busy doing the same with hers .
yes , word of mike &apos;s miraculous recovery
spread quickly throughout wisteria lane
and stopped cold everyone &apos;s busy , busy life .
everyone , that is ,
except for susan mayer ,
who was busy doing something
she would soon wish she hadn &apos;t .
edward sibley was the beloved founder of the town of fairview .
prior to that , he was best known as a bootlegger ...
... a womanizer and a horse thief .
of course , no one remembers those parts of edward &apos;s past .
luckily for him , history is designed to be rewritten .
and no one knew this better than bree hodge .
so , you &apos;re just gonna lie to people ?
i &apos;m not talking about a lie , just a polite fiction
to explain to everybody where you &apos;ve been .
we can &apos;t tell them you &apos;ve been living on
skid row sleeping in a cardboard box .
so why do i have to go to this history fair anyway ?
it &apos;s just some dumb school contest .
we all know danielle &apos;s not gonna win .
she never wins anything .
is it weird eating off plates ?
&apos;cause if you were more comfortable you could just
eat straight out of the garbage .
this is a family event and we &apos;re all gonna enjoy it together .
so danielle stop sniping and start
thinking of an alibi for your brother .
i know , we could say he joined a cult
and we had to kidnap and deprogram him .
well , that would spare the family some embarrassment .
why not throw in a killing spree , too ?
well , here &apos;s a thought . we say he was at drama camp .
it reflects andrew &apos;s interest in the performing arts ,
while giving us a private joke
to savor about the drama of his estrangement .
uh , yeah , he is always like that .
uh , guys , why can &apos;t we just tell the truth ?
i got out of line , you kicked me out ,
i lived on the street , i came back home .
we &apos;ll need a name for this drama camp .
we got ties here , people .
designer ties , two for a dollar .
do you like those barbells ?
make me an offer . i &apos;m feeling generous .
here &apos;s the customer i &apos;ve been waiting for .
carlos , i see you got my flier .
you &apos;re having a garage sale featuring menswear
and sporting equipment .
i need cash .
and you don &apos;t expect me to sell my stuff , do you ?
those are my good cuff links .
those are my cds .
oh , my god . this is my baby blanket .
my mama knitted this .
and it pains me to sell it .
it &apos;s just that my lawyer told me
what you &apos;re offering for spousal support
and i can &apos;t get by on that .
i am doing the best i can . i &apos;ve got a few deals in the pipeline .
but i &apos;m not making as much as i used to .
so i should be punished ?
attention , shoppers ! for the next 20 minutes ,
free golf club with every purchase .
gabby , i &apos;m trying to be civil .
but if you don &apos;t knock it off right now ,
the gloves are coming off .
honey , the gloves aren &apos;t just off , they &apos;re 70 % off .
get your cashmere gloves !
hey , parker . where &apos;s your uniform ?
you got your game in an hour .
no , i don &apos;t . i quit .
what ?
i hate baseball .
daddy said i don &apos;t have to play it anymore .
daddy should have checked with mommy ,
so she could have a chance to tell him
why he &apos;s wrong .
hey , you &apos;re playing .
but , mom , i suck . everybody says so .
they made up a fake position for me .
it is not fake .
there is not a team that could get along
without their backup far right fielder .
ok , come on . let &apos;s go practice .
all right , let &apos;s try it again . nice and easy .
watch the ball , hit the bat . you ready ?
you can do it . here we go .
ok , parker , i keep telling you ,
you gotta keep your eyes open .
how are you gonna hit the ball when you &apos;re doing this ?
you threw it too fast . throw slower .
if i threw any slower , we would be bowling .
hey . hey , what you guys doing ?
i &apos;ll tell you what we &apos;re not doing , quitting .
hey , buddy . did you change your mind ?
no .
lynette , i told him that he didn &apos;t have to play anymore .
he &apos;s got five more games .
he made a commitment . he &apos;s gonna see it through .
but lynette , he doesn &apos;t like it .
and if you haven &apos;t noticed , he kind of sucks .
yeah . well , that &apos;s not the point .
what message are we sending if we let him quit
whenever the going gets rough ?
it &apos;s a way to kill three hours before they eat pizza .
why are you being such a hard @-@ ass ?
it &apos;s called parenting , tom . watch and learn .
ok , p @-@ dog , this is a curve ball .
again , opening the eyes . can &apos;t stress it enough .
you sure it &apos;s ok if we stay another day ?
let &apos;s see .
what excuse did we use
when we had this conversation yesterday ?
that we work hard and we deserve to relax .
no . i believe that was last thursday &apos;s rationale .
fresh air is good for us ?
tuesday .
okay , here &apos;s one .
julie needs to spend more time bonding with her father .
brilliant !
if we keep this up , we could stay here till christmas .
sometimes when you smile like that ,
it really makes me think that ...
what ? what were you gonna say ?
it makes me think that i could love you .
i don &apos;t mean love in the swooning schoolboy sense ,
you know , fireworks exploding , bells ringing .
to me , it &apos;s about this ,
a mundane task that &apos;s suddenly a joy
because of who you &apos;re doing it with .
that &apos;s love to me .
someone to fluff while you fold ,
someone to whisper to at a boring party , to ...
do you mind ?
you &apos;re kind of drowning out the bells .
so i am .
i think i can feed myself now .
you said that yesterday
and i wound up with a cleavage full of pudding .
you heard the therapist .
it &apos;s gonna be weeks before you &apos;re up and running .
i just wanna get home , unpack .
you just let home come to you , ok ?
the whole street &apos;s dying to see you .
bree is even bakin &apos; you a peach pie .
she &apos;s the redhead , right ?
right .
husband &apos;s the doctor . rex .
rex is dead .
really ? when did that happen ?
about a year and a half ago .
what ?
yeah . you were at his funeral .
what are you talking about ?
that &apos;s not possible . i just met him right before my accident .
mike , what year is it ?
2004 . why ?
it &apos;s called retrograde memory loss .
it &apos;s caused by the swelling and frontal @-@ iobe damage .
you say he &apos;s lost two whole years ?
yeah . is that unusual ?
well , patients more typically lose several weeks .
the damage may be more severe than we thought .
do you think he &apos;ll get his memory back ?
he might . at least partially .
you could be some assistance with that .
how ?
bring him some personal belongings .
photos , letters .
he &apos;s gonna need some help to remember what he can &apos;t .
well , i &apos;m sure i could fill in a few blanks .
did i tell you that
burnham fox is looking for a new creative director ?
pr ? what makes you think i wanna work for a pr firm ?
easy hours , big paycheck , access to great parties .
yeahs . what was i thinking ?
honey , we agreed that i would chase my dream .
that ain &apos;t it .
i was just making conversation .
batter up .
is he up ?
oh , come on .
come on , parker . keep your eye on the ball .
strike one .
hey , people . he &apos;s just a kid , ok ? come on .
strike two .
hey , hey . that is not helpful .
can we takes one , parker . only takes one .
it &apos;s not your son &apos;s fault .
he &apos;s up against the best pitcher in the league .
that guy &apos;s a machine . who is that kid ?
nicky abbott . he &apos;s a neighbor of mine .
kid &apos;s got an arm like a 13 @-@ year @-@ old .
strike three . you &apos;re out .
i &apos;m gonna go buy him an ice cream .
it &apos;s ok , p @-@ dog . you &apos;re gonna get &apos; em the next inning .
so , tell me , what else do you know about this nicky kid ?
you &apos;re short 50 cents .
please . that &apos;s all i got .
hey . give the kid what he wants .
thanks . hey , aren &apos;t you parker scavo &apos;s mom ?
that &apos;s right .
come . walk with me .
so , money &apos;s a little tight , huh ?
a little .
yeah , i heard your old man &apos;s outta work .
that &apos;s gotta be tough .
yeah . they cut my allowance .
no . a kid &apos;s gotta have an allowance .
how else are you gonna buy the things you want , right ?
like that cotton candy .
that &apos;s a little piece of heaven , huh ?
hey , i got an idea .
we could help each other out .
my son &apos;s having trouble hitting the ball .
yeah , i saw that .
yeah .
ever seen one of these ?
carlos , what are you doing here ,
i mean , besides lowering my property value ?
i had a little news
i wanted to see your face when i delivered it .
i &apos;m tired of fighting , so i called my lawyer
and told him to give in to your demands for spousal support .
really ?
well , thank you .
ok , you &apos;ve seen my face . now you can beat it .
wait , there &apos;s more .
since i &apos;m gonna be giving you all that money ,
i have to cut back on some stuff ,
like the rent on my apartment .
but the good news is , according to my lawyer ,
i &apos;m completely within my rights to do this .
honey , i &apos;m home .
wait . you can &apos;t stay here .
now there &apos;s the face that i was looking for .
batter up .
strike one .
wow . that was kinda slow . his arm must be getting tired .
yeah , well , after all those fastballs .
come on , parker . you can do it .
strike two .
oh , my god !
mr. faladi , i cannot thank you enough
for getting danielle interested in history .
she has never worked so hard on a project before .
well , don &apos;t tell anyone , but she is my favorite student .
and it &apos;s so good to see that andrew &apos;s back .
where &apos;s he been all this time ?
drama camp . a very prestigious drama camp .
do i know you ?
yeah .
uh , you gave me a ride in your black sedan once .
you know , the one with the reclining seats ?
excuse me .
wasn &apos;t that dr. keck ? you know him ?
yeah . yeah . we , uh , we met at a drama camp .
oh , good lord . you mean ... ?
yeah . i , uh ... performed for him once .
are you all right ?
i &apos;ll be all right . i &apos;m fine .
howard keck ?
you sure ?
he &apos;s a very respected member of the community .
yeah , well , they all were .
what were you and andrew talking about today , at the fair ?
uh ... nothing .
i was gonna make some cocoa . would you like some ?
orson , i saw the two of you whispering
right after dr. keck ran off .
what happened ?
look , andrew asked me not to say anything ,
but i don &apos;t want there to be any secrets between us , so ...
please don &apos;t let him know i told you .
well , of course not . what is it ?
how to put this , uh ...
when andrew was on the street ,
he didn &apos;t just beg for money .
at times he ... well , he did things to earn it .
good . i mean ,
i &apos;d hate to think he had no work ethic at all .
what i mean is ,
men hired him to ...
... do things , things he wasn &apos;t very proud of .
yard work ?
afraid not .
orson , you &apos;re scaring me .
did he do something awful ?
no . no , not awful . i mean , people do it all the time .
i do it with you . i just don &apos;t pay you for it .
i think someone could use a cocoa .
look , we mustn &apos;t judge andrew .
he was desperate .
i &apos;ll never forgive myself .
it &apos;s all my fault for pushing him away .
bree , don &apos;t do that to yourself .
the important thing is he &apos;s home and safe .
how does dr. keck fit into this ?
is he treating andrew for some awful disease ?
actually , i think he was one of andrew &apos;s ... clients .
howard keck ? that &apos;s ridiculous .
he &apos;s got a wife and a daughter .
he plays on tom scavo &apos;s bowling team .
well , it &apos;s clearly not the only team he plays for .
this is a nightmare . an absolute nightmare .
please don &apos;t cut into that pie . i made it for mike .
mike ... delfino ?
yes , i left you two messages .
didn &apos;t you check your voice mail ?
he woke up from his coma .
oh , god .
who is it ? is it sharla banning ? -
i &apos;m not telling who it is .
i &apos;m just asking the question .
if you know a husband has been unfaithful ,
do you tell the wife ?
absolutely . if he is cheating , he could bring home a disease .
that &apos;s what i was thinking
and that &apos;s how bunny conners got chlamydia .
she said it was from wearing someone &apos;s bathing suit .
no , that &apos;s how she got crabs .
poor bunny , it &apos;s always something .
if not the clap , it &apos;s a botched face lift .
be that as it may , do we all agree that
i should tell this man &apos;s wife ?
i wouldn &apos;t . women always say
they wanna know if their husband is cheating
and they always resent the person who tells them .
if tom cheated , you wouldn &apos;t tell me ?
no .
but i would hire someone to beat the crap out of him .
aww . you &apos;re sweet .
bree , i &apos;m sorry .
i think you gotta follow your heart on this one .
even if it isn &apos;t the easiest thing to do .
gabby ... are you and carlos getting back together ?
why ?
uh ... would you excuse me ?
carlos , what are you doing ?
i told you i was having friends over .
i &apos;m thirsty . and this is my kitchen , too .
hey , ladies .
for god &apos;s sakes , put some pants on .
i wanted to .
but somebody threw my laundry out of the dryer
while it was wet .
don &apos;t act like you didn &apos;t deserved that .
what are you talking about ?
you peed in my shampoo . admit it .
what ?
the cap was loose and i know how your sick mind works .
really ? in that case , you should know that if i was gonna
do something like that i wouldn &apos;t do it to your shampoo .
i would do it to your mouthwash ,
soup and decaffeinated coffee .
ladies .
to answer your question ,
no , we are not getting back together .
i love this music . what &apos;s it about ?
making love . regret . cigarettes .
cigarettes ?
it &apos;s what i assume . it &apos;s french .
they write what they know .
i &apos;d love to go to france someday .
would you like to go next month ?
are you serious ?
i &apos;m going on business . come with me .
ian , i just took a week off .
i couldn &apos;t possibly justify taking another .
you &apos;ll manage .
we &apos;ve proven ourselves masters of the flimsy rationalization .
well , ok . you gotta promise me
we &apos;ll actually leave the hotel room .
it &apos;s paris , dear . you can pretty much make love anywhere .
you said you didn &apos;t get reception here .
well . the occasional signal gets through .
please don &apos;t answer .
oh , it &apos;s julie . i have to .
hello . what &apos;s up ?
i can &apos;t ...
no , can you say that again ?
the signal &apos;s really bad .
what ? oh , my god .
is something wrong ?
mike woke up .
um , julie , when did he w ...
julie ? julie ?
oh , damn it ! oh , my god .
oh , my god .
i have to go . i gotta get out of here .
yes , of course .
i think that you &apos;re sitting on my bra .
what &apos;d the coach say ?
what do you think he say ? parker &apos;s off the team .
that &apos;s not fair . it &apos;s not his fault .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
because his mother bribed an eight @-@ year @-@ old pitcher ,
who also , by the way , was kicked off of his team .
not nicky , too ?
what were you thinking ?
i was trying to repair my son &apos;s shattered self @-@ esteem .
with a 50 ?
honey , everything would have been fine
if you &apos;d just let parker quit .
well , excuse me for not wanting my son to be a quitter .
yeah , &apos; cause i guess having two in the family
would be a bit much .
whoa . where &apos;d that come from ?
you say that you support my decision to leave advertising
to follow my dream ,
but it is obvious that you resent it .
that is not true .
why do you keep dropping hints
about the job at burnham fox , huh ?
i just figured , since you &apos;re taking your time
figuring out what your dream even is ,
you might make a few bucks in the meantime .
i have a dream too . it includes keeping this house .
like i don &apos;t ...
are you fighting ?
no .
no .
it was excitement .
because we have just decided
you don &apos;t have to play baseball anymore .
isn &apos;t that great ?
but i can &apos;t stop now .
huh ?
not when i &apos;m finally getting good .
you were right , mom .
i just need a little more practice . come on . let &apos;s go practice .
see you outside .
so , what &apos;s on the next page of your parenting handbook ?
ian , can you please hurry ?
i am hurrying .
we should be on the road ten minutes ago .
it &apos;s not like checking out of a hotel .
there &apos;s doors to secure , i have to turn the gas valve off .
can &apos;t you do that stuff later ?
when ? after the place is overrun by raccoons ?
of course the joke &apos;ll be on them when it blows up .
mike is awake , he &apos;s lying there
and he &apos;s wondering where i am .
yes , i get it . you &apos;re in a hurry . just please give me a minute .
i bet you &apos;d move faster if jane were awake .
here &apos;s the picture that you took of me
in my bikini at that pool party .
you could have warned me i was showing a little nip .
oh . susan mayer . remember her ?
yeah . she &apos;s pretty .
yeah , she is sorta in this picture .
is there a date on this thing ?
the nurses said that she visited me a lot .
we were close , huh ?
you have just come out of a coma .
can we not talk about susan
till you start to regain your strength ?
why ?
oh , god . i hate to be the one telling you this .
well , if you don &apos;t want to ...
that tramp treated you like dirt .
she strung you along , she slept with other guys .
you broke up with her twice .
then why did she keep visiting me when i was out of it ?
well , she &apos;s a bit of a stalker .
i was worried that she was gonna coming here
and disconnect one of the tubes or something .
but don &apos;t worry , she &apos;s glommed onto some new guy ,
she &apos;s up in the mountains at his place with him right now .
she told the nurses that she really loved me .
that &apos;s the one thing about susan that you must never forget .
she is a liar .
you waiting to see mike delfino ?
yes . i &apos;m a ... i &apos;m a neighbor .
but he has a visitor , so i &apos;ll come back later .
don &apos;t be surprise if he doesn &apos;t recognize you .
he &apos;s suffered significant memory loss .
really ?
that &apos;s too bad .
sure you don &apos;t wanna go in ?
ms.britt &apos;s here all the time.she won &apos;t mind .
no , i &apos;ve waited this long . i can wait a bit longer .
gabby ?
hey , carlos . what &apos;s up ?
my key won &apos;t work .
that &apos;s probably because i had the locks changed .
gabby .
can &apos;t be too safe .
you never know when someone might move in on you
when you &apos;re not looking .
hello , 911 ? there &apos;s an intruder breaking into my home .
can you tell them to come armed ? i think he &apos;s mexican .
i &apos;m telling you . i &apos;m her husband .
i bought her this house . my name is on the deed .
ma &apos;am , if you &apos;re married , it &apos;s a matter of public record .
i can find out quickly .
all right . we &apos;re going through a messy divorce ,
and he moved back in on me .
and everyone knows the wife keeps the house
and the husband gets the crappy apartment .
it &apos;s the american way .
call my lawyer . this is all totally legal .
and she knows it . she &apos;s trying to get back at me .
i hear that .
you wouldn &apos;t believe
the stuff my wife pulled when we split .
you can &apos;t take sides .
police officers aren &apos;t allowed to take sides .
i pay your salary .
ted , you see that ?
this lady just assaulted me .
it was a swat . ted , does this hurt ?
get your hands off me . police brutality !
this is all my fault . why punish parker ?
sorry , mrs. scavo . rules are rules .
i can &apos;t put him back on the team .
just one more game , he &apos;ll suck ,
the other kids will taunt him .
he &apos;ll wanna quit again . see , everybody wins .
wish i could help , but ...
please .
you can &apos;t bend the rules just once ?
you know , the team could use some new batting helmets .
i &apos;ll get my checkbook .
hello , vera .
i made you some of those shortbread biscuits
that you like so much .
how sweet . can you stay for some tea ?
it &apos;s been so long . we have some catching up to do .
yes . yes , we do .
i know how painful this must be for you .
it isn &apos;t easy for me either , considering andrew &apos;s role in it .
and why have you told me this ?
because i thought you &apos;d wanna know .
why ?
so you could do something .
do you think i &apos;m an idiot ?
that i know nothing about the man
i &apos;ve lived with for 27 years ?
i &apos;ve always assumed howard had some outlet .
a friend tucked away somewhere .
i didn &apos;t know . i didn &apos;t care to know .
but thank you for painting so vivid , so indelible a picture
of my husband &apos;s activities .
i &apos;m sorry . i just felt that if it were me , i ...
you &apos;d want to know .
yes . absolutely .
then i owe you an apology .
because i &apos;ve been sitting on a little secret about your family .
actually , it &apos;s not much of a secret .
my daughter tells me
it &apos;s common knowledge among the cheerleaders .
what is ?
the fact that danielle is sleeping with her history teacher .
but where are my manners ?
i should have brought some biscuits with that .
batter up .
well , aren &apos;t we just the parents of the year ?
rooting for our son to fail
so we can weasel out of a bribery scandal .
two bribery scandals . gotta count the batting helmets .
strike one .
you konw for what &apos;s it worth ,
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re a quitter .
good .
and you don &apos;t resent me ?
no .
ok , well , maybe a little .
why ?
you get to chase your dream
while i get to spend my life in advertising .
strike two .
maybe i &apos;d like to write a book or ,
you know , start my own magazine .
then i think , &quot; i can &apos;t . i have a family to support . &quot;
and i am ok with that ... most of the time .
you know what ?
i &apos;m gonna look into that job at burnham fox .
don &apos;t you dare .
you are gonna chase your dream
and i am gonna support you 99 % of the time .
that &apos;s all i could really ask for .
how the hell did he do that ?
crap , they &apos;re cheering for him .
oh , jeez . he &apos;s never gonna quit now .
what are we gonna say to him ?
i don &apos;t know , buddy .
it looks like a pretty bad sprain .
probably gonna be out the rest of the season .
damn .
hey , but you know what ? that was one heck of a hit .
sure was .
posted your bail . we can go .
gabby ...
don &apos;t talk to me .
oh , lighten up . you were in there for maybe an hour .
the whole thing is funny and you know it .
come on , gabby .
we &apos;ve been going at each other for months now .
can we just stop ?
you know we &apos;re gonna end up back together .
wow . you are crazy .
what &apos;s crazy is throwing away the past three years .
why can &apos;t we just say what we really feel for a change ?
fine . i &apos;ll get the ball rolling . i still love you .
that &apos;s too bad . i don &apos;t love you .
yeah , right .
i don &apos;t .
and i haven &apos;t for a very long time .
that &apos;s a lie . you &apos;re just saying that to hurt me .
no . if i wanted to hurt you
i would tell you about last weekend ,
when i slept with john rowland .
carlos , what are you doing ?
carlos !
carlos !
you can &apos;t leave me out here in the middle of nowhere .
danielle , he is your history teacher
and he is 35 years old .
robert says age is just a number .
don &apos;t you dare leave .
you can &apos;t break us up . i love him and he loves me .
come on , mom .
i am so tired of feeling like
the worst mother who ever lived .
you &apos;re not . there &apos;s grandma .
i &apos;ve tried so hard to set a good example .
i &apos;ve done the best i could to
teach you kids right from wrong .
why isn &apos;t it taking ?
it took . i mean ,
we know the difference between right from wrong .
we just chose wrong .
why ?
sometimes when you push a kid really hard to go one way ,
the other way starts to look more entertaining .
you &apos;re awful .
i know . i blame shoddy parenting .
you know , we never discussed
what it was like for you while you were away .
i just want you to know , if you ever wanna talk about it ,
there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t tell me .
thanks .
not right now , ok ?
i &apos;ll pick up my bags later .
it &apos;s not my fault you weren &apos;t there .
what ?
it &apos;s not . i know what you &apos;re feeling , but ...
how could you possibly know ?
for six months
i have prayed every day for that man to wake up .
and you made me give up on him .
i did not make you .
not on purpose . but you did .
you were sweet , charming and english .
and that why when my prayers were answered ,
i was naked in someone else &apos;s arms .
this should never have happened .
you can say what you want .
say that you feel guilty . say that it was bad timing .
but don &apos;t you say that this should never have happened .
because you &apos;re the best thing
that &apos;s happened to me in years .
ian , i &apos;m sorry .
i know how you feel .
it &apos;s mike . it &apos;s my mike .
then ... then you should go .
thank you .
oh , my god . you are awake .
hi , susan .
oh , god .
it &apos;s so wonderful to hear your voice again .
they say you &apos;ve been here a lot .
yes . yes , i have .
almost every day .
i can &apos;t tell you how much i &apos;m kicking myself
for not being here when you woke up .
where were you ?
i was in the country .
but i &apos;m back now .
ok .
something wrong ? you don &apos;t seem happy to see me .
to be honest , i don &apos;t remember you .
what ?
i remember moving to fairview and meeting people .
after that , nothing .
the doctors say it &apos;s the head trauma .
but you &apos;re gonna be all right .
i &apos;m gonna help you remember .
if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;m kind of tired now .
ok .
right , you , um ... you sleep .
i &apos;ll come back tomorrow .
i &apos;d rather you didn &apos;t .
well , i &apos;ve got therapy .
maybe next week .
ok .
we all have our reasons for rewriting history .
sometimes we need to provide ourselves alibis .
drama camp was awesome .
we &apos;re talking zero supervision .
sometimes we wanna hurt someone who has hurt us .
so you can tell carlos that he can have the photo albums .
she says that they hold no sentimental value for her .
and then there are times
we just wanna spare ourselves embarrassment .
i don &apos;t know how these rumors start .
parker only quit the team &apos; cause he hurt his ankle .
of course , there are some who feel that
to rewrite history is just another way to lie .
and poor howard has to work late again tonight .
of course , he does it all for the family .
but what is history anyway ...
you say i dated susan for a long time .
do you think i was in love with her ?
... but a set of lies , agreed upon ?
i don &apos;t .
i really , really don &apos;t .
