your sources were correct , sir .
the iranian is attempting to procure
a high @-@ level @-@ intelligence package .
we believe it could lead to the answer you seek .
have it intercepted .
that may prove ... difficult .
the seller hired the courier to make the exchange .
the last time we attempted to intercept him --
i &apos;m well aware of the men and resources we lost in cairo .
perhaps this is an opportunity
to let our new ... friends at the fbi carry the water .
马萨诸塞州 波士顿 天使站酒店
i &apos;ve been ordered to include you in the oversight committee brief
on reddington next week .
cooper told me .
here &apos;s the profile i prepared on him .
have i told you yet i don &apos;t place much stock in profiling ?
and by &quot; much , &quot; i mean &quot; none . &quot;
it &apos;s never once helped me solve a case .
you know what has ?
facts .
yeah .
i also prepared a profile on you .
&quot; uptight , fueled by an inner rage ,
&quot; capable of the occasional moment of tenderness ,
&quot; which likely brings on the desire
to stay up all night watching asian porn . &quot;
not even close .
huh . how about this ?
you don &apos;t trust me .
you think i &apos;m tainted somehow -- maybe a traitor .
you resent the fact that reddington wants to
to work directly with me instead of you .
speak of the devil -- it &apos;s the devil .
what is this place ?
something of a hideaway .
it used to be home
to one of the finest american writers who ever lived --
fredrick hempstead .
never heard of him .
no , you haven &apos;t . nobody has .
dear fredrick was waiting tables
when we first met --
strange little man , built like a fireplug .
he was living here with his mother until she died .
poor fredrick couldn &apos;t afford to stay on ,
so i bought the place for him .
please .
sadly , fredrick died without ever being published ,
but this place is chock @-@ full of his work --
manuscripts , poems , unsent letters ,
and lots and lots of this .
what is that ?
no earthly idea .
some sort of distilled alcohol , i think .
there &apos;s bottles of the stuff stashed everywhere .
would you like me to pour you a few fingers ?
why am i here ?
have you ever wondered
how criminals who know they can &apos;t trust one another
are still able to conduct business with each other ?
they replace trust with fear and the threat of violence .
the next target on the blacklist
is a physical embodiment of both .
he &apos;s known as the courier ,
and his involvement in a transaction
virtually guarantees success .
once he &apos;s hired to make a delivery ,
he can &apos;t be bribed , he can &apos;t be stopped .
if either party attempts to double @-@ cross the other ,
he kills them both .
the perfect middleman for an imperfect world .
cooper &apos;s not gonna sanction a black op
against the u.p.s. driver of crime .
he will when you tell him the courier is scheduled
to deliver a package worth $ 20 million .
at that price , it could be anything
from a genetically engineered virus
to a very important person &apos;s head in a bag .
does he have a name ?
i &apos;m sure he does . i don &apos;t know it .
skip to the part where you tell me
how you expect us to find him .
i know the man he &apos;s planning on delivering the package to
an iranian spy named hamid soroush .
where are they making the exchange ?
at the winston farmer &apos;s market
in ... 2 hours and 45 minutes .
my one o &apos;clock ?
could be him .
same height , right age .
you reading me , haircut ?
stay on him .
when it rings , pick it up .
he just gave him something .
it &apos;s a cell . he &apos;s moving .
what &apos;s he saying ?
i don &apos;t know . we &apos;ve got nothing .
get someone to point a mike at this guy .
he &apos;s off .
excuse me .
can you break a $ 100 ?
i think he just made contact .
all teams start casually moving to the east side of the market .
do not spook this guy .
chang , get closer on the produce guy &apos;s face .
i think he made us .
tactical teams , you &apos;re up .
i want south side sealed off from the outside .
just made contact .
shots fired ! soroush is down !
i don &apos;t have eyes on the shooter !
all teams , move in now .
you hit ?
it &apos;s not my blood .
suspect &apos;s heading north on 6th .
i need local air and law @-@ enforcement support now .
keys ! give me the keys !
give me the damn keys !
air support on the way .
engage -- two minutes .
cut him off at the next intersection !
do it .
we &apos;re at the corner of 10th and spencer .
the courier &apos;s vehicle has been disabled .
move and you &apos;re dead .
put your other hand up .
get your hands up !
put it up now .
put your arm up now .
i can &apos;t .
put your other arm up .
oh , my god .
let &apos;s try this again .
what were you supposed to deliver ?
please . help us , and maybe we can help you .
what about that iranian spy
whose head you exploded all over my partner ?
huh ? you remember him ?
he had banking codes with a $ 20 million wire transfer
in his pocket .
you &apos;re a courier .
you were supposed to give a package to the iranian .
where &apos;s the package ? !
we found nothing at the farmer &apos;s market ,
nothing in his vehicle , nothing on him .
what was he supposed to be delivering ?
i don &apos;t know , harold .
might it be conceivable
your people actually missed something ?
you &apos;re not telling us everything .
let me put your mind at ease .
i &apos;m never telling you everything .
i did my job here .
i gave you a blacklister .
there he sits .
obviously , good cop / bad cop isn &apos;t working here ,
so let &apos;s try bad cop / worse cop .
how &apos;s the arm ?
looks painful .
where &apos;s the package ? !
smile all you want .
we &apos;re just getting started , pal .
why did he kill soroush ?
obviously , he spotted one of your agents ,
and poor soroush paid the price .
there &apos;s a knife wound in his chest ,
scars all over his body .
you know how he got them ?
that &apos;s interesting .
i always wondered if the stories were true .
i think you may need to call a doctor .
i &apos;ve read about cases like this .
your suspect has congenital anhidrosis .
it &apos;s a rare genetic disorder .
he can &apos;t feel physical pain .
that makes sense .
and the scarring ?
people with the disorder
obviously get injured more often ,
but not -- not like that .
that ...
that &apos;s something else entirely .
we &apos;re more interested in the knife wound in his chest .
we think he might have placed evidence ...
inside of it .
what evidence ?
we &apos;re not sure .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
my name ...
my name -- my name is seth -- is seth nelson .
w @-@ why are you doing this ? please .
that &apos;s the only thing on the chip taken from his chest ?
newspaper &apos;s from yesterday .
time stamp on the video file is 4 : 29 this morning .
it &apos;s a proof @-@ of @-@ life video .
the oxygen mask , the tanks --
wherever this guy is , his hours are numbered .
we didn &apos;t find a package because there wasn &apos;t one , sir .
soroush was putting up $ 20 million for this guy .
we just stopped him from delivering a ransom payment .
塞斯 · 尼尔森
we got a hit when we ran
his name and face through the dmv servers .
seth nelson -- lives in maryland with his parents ,
works tech support for a cable company .
assuming each oxygen cylinder was full ,
he has maybe 20 hours left before his air runs out .
ultrasound machine .
i want to know what other surprises
the courier has hiding inside him .
i also want to know why
anyone thinks this kid is worth $ 20 million .
he &apos;s probably worth more .
my cia sources just confirmed
he &apos;s an nsa analyst -- one of their best --
and only one of three people allowed to write and access
the security protocols and software .
if he &apos;s coerced into working for a foreign power
or criminal network , the damage would be catastrophic .
we need to make the courier talk .
there must be something he wants .
the guy &apos;s a psychopath .
luckily , we happen to have our own psychopath .
this is hilarious .
fredrick wrote to the editor of the washington post
almost every day -- thank you -- about any and every subject .
listen to this one .
&quot; dear mr. bradley , what is up with all the rabbits &quot; --
i need to know what you &apos;re not telling me about the courier .
and what do i get in return ?
my gratitude .
tell me what you &apos;ve learned about your husband .
the gun that i found in the box
is connected to an open homicide .
of whom ?
it &apos;s ... classified . i can &apos;t read the file .
i imagine you &apos;ve found ways around that particular obstacle .
i know it happened in boston last year .
i think it was a russian tourist who was murdered --
victor fokin .
you lived in new york at the time .
why would you think your husband would be in boston ?
because i was there with him .
he supposedly had a job interview ,
and we made it into a small vacation .
a few years ago , some of my associates
encountered the courier in an opium den in cairo .
he killed two of them .
if he still has a taste for the poppy ,
there &apos;s a man who may be able to help us .
you &apos;re talking about a drug dealer .
i &apos;m talking about a friend -- a philosopher
who practices an ancient ritual going back thousands of years .
there &apos;s a good chance he could be helpful
in locating the courier &apos;s safe house .
all i care about is finding seth .
call your friend .
i want the courier &apos;s safe @-@ house address .
thank you .
for what ?
for being honest with me .
in my life , i don &apos;t encounter that frequently .
got a name -- tommy phelps .
run it through the databases , see if it &apos;s even real .
you guys need to see this .
he had the iranian buyer under surveillance for several days .
and this woman , i think she &apos;s the seller --
responsible for kidnapping seth
and hiring the courier to pick up her money .
why the surveillance ?
according to reddington ,
the courier kills anyone who tries to double @-@ cross him .
he probably wanted to know where to find them
if something went wrong .
find out who this woman is .
he has five objects embedded inside him .
some are surrounded with scar tissue --
been there for years .
what objects ?
we &apos;ve only been able to identify two --
a key and another chip .
the others are just shadows .
i need a higher @-@ resolution scan to i.d. them .
take him to walter reed .
i want everything inside of him cut out .
the kid has -- what -- 14 hours of air left ?
i can tell you where he is .
in exchange for what ?
immunity .
i talk , then walk .
never gonna happen .
then the kid &apos;s dead .
i &apos;ve been trying to figure out
if there &apos;s anything in this world you care about .
how about him ?
care about your little brother -- tommy ?
from petersburg federal prison right now .
anything you want me to tell him ?
you finally find him ?
tell me about your brother --
who he works with , his contacts .
tell me about the people in his life .
there are no people in his life .
there &apos;s you .
tried to help you break out , didn &apos;t he ?
from what i understand ,
he &apos;d do anything for his little brother .
what &apos;s he moving now ?
a 26 @-@ year @-@ old m.i.t. grad .
lady , you don &apos;t understand tommy .
i know his condition prevents him from feel--
no , i mean you don &apos;t understand him .
our old man knocked us around when he needed to ,
which didn &apos;t bother tommy .
but dad hated that --
felt like he couldn &apos;t control his own son ,
and he couldn &apos;t .
so when he was 11,
dad started hosting these dogfights .
not with two dogs , but with a dog and tommy .
well , we had this barn .
people would come from miles around .
they &apos;d get drunk and make bets .
what it did to him over time ...
tommy &apos;s broken .
somewhere in his head , a switch flipped .
i wish i could help you , but ...
you know how it goes .
you &apos;re here because somebody screwed up .
the deal went sideways .
and now the buyer and seller have targets on their head ,
if they &apos;re not dead already .
her name &apos;s laurence dechambou .
she &apos;s ex @-@ french intelligence .
she now makes a handsome living selling secrets ,
mostly of a technological nature .
i really don &apos;t understand any of it .
but she &apos;s clearly stepping up on this one ,
trying to make a legacy for herself .
she owns that nightclub .
last time i was there , we had a great deal of fun ,
until she tried to strangle me with her stocking .
i &apos;ll get a warrant .
you &apos;ll have it by the time you get there .
she won &apos;t talk , and even if she did ,
what would you expect her to say ?
she may know seth &apos;s location .
she won &apos;t .
she &apos;s the only lead we have .
we arrest her and take our chances .
this is a bad idea , harold .
actually , there may be another option .
she had to hand over seth to the courier somewhere .
we find the location , we might get lucky .
there could be security @-@ cam
or atm footage of the exchange .
and we use it to track
the courier &apos;s movements last night .
that could lead to seth .
and why would she tell you that , again ?
she doesn &apos;t have to . she &apos;s still expecting her money .
we send someone in as the courier ,
tell her the exchange was a setup , the deal &apos;s off ,
she can pick up seth where she dropped him off .
and we follow her to the drop @-@ off point .
if you really want her to talk , i should meet with her .
every time you &quot; meet , &quot; someone ends up dead .
we &apos;ve gotten off to a rocky start .
you &apos;ve killed three people .
i &apos;m not perfect .
if we did this , we &apos;d be operating under the assumption
that dechambou has never met the courier face @-@ to @-@ face .
it &apos;s too risky .
he &apos;s right .
let me go . i can do this .
first sign this is going south , i want that club swarmed .
or just bend over any available piece of furniture
and let her slap you on the ass .
she loves that .
oh , my god . tom .
oh , god . he &apos;s gonna kill me .
i &apos;m so sorry .
you need to come home .
okay ? i canceled the ultrasound .
liz ?
i can &apos;t do this right now .
look , i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t care what &apos;s going on at work , okay ?
you and i need to talk .
something incredibly important came up .
i don &apos;t care ! you and i need to talk about something ,
and it &apos;s more important .
i promise we &apos;ll talk as long as you like , but later .
this is an emergen--
all teams stand by .
our man is entering the building .
here to see dechambou .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
line &apos;s over there , slick .
you need to make an example here .
you have to hurt him . that &apos;s what the courier would do .
you know , i think we got off on the wrong foot here , uh ...
isn &apos;t that her over there ?
that was hot .
you know he can hear you , right ?
yep .
hey . come with me .
let &apos;s go . come on .
would you mind excusing me for a moment ?
you injured my doorman ...
forced your way into my club .
is there a reason why i should not kill you right now ?
you kill me , you kill seth nelson .
you &apos;re --
what the hell are you doing here ?
we agreed the money was to be dropped off
at a specified location .
plans change .
no . they don &apos;t .
the only reason i employed you
was to shield me from unwanted attention ,
and now you &apos;re at my front door ?
there is no money .
the iranian was working with the fbi .
i killed him .
i &apos;ve known soroush for years .
well , if he didn &apos;t set me up ,
that leaves only one other person -- you .
and i never trusted him .
that &apos;s why i employed you .
the bastard screwed us both here .
your nsa geek is where you left him last night .
we &apos;re done . don &apos;t contact me again .
wait !
how do i know it &apos;s really you --
that i &apos;m not being set up myself ?
not my problem .
they say you can &apos;t feel pain . prove it .
we &apos;re coming in .
all teams prepare to mobilize .
first team , swarm the north doors on my --
is this what you need to see ?
you want to watch me bleed , see if i react ?
i &apos;ve already lost the only thing in this world i &apos;ve ever loved .
i have nothing in this world , except this job .
impressive .
except for one mistake .
if the iranian is dead ,
the real courier would have killed me , too ,
which makes me wonder ...
get out -- now !
... who the hell are you ?
asset compromised . hit the building .
she kidnapped seth but has no idea where he is .
yeah , well , the kid has less than eight hours of air left .
somebody had better get that courier talking .
what do you suggest ? torture him ?
he doesn &apos;t feel pain .
he does feel pain .
he &apos;s got a brother serving 15 years in petersburg --
the one thing in the world he cares about .
offer to reduce or commute his sentence
in exchange for telling us seth &apos;s location --
the life of a stranger for the life of his brother .
call the marshals . get him back here .
we &apos;ll cut him open later .
he wounded two of the marshals and killed one with a concealed knife .
he was searched multiple times .
we think he used one of the objects hidden inside him .
he was carrying around his own escape package .
prisoner transport was found abandoned
in woodbridge , virginia .
there &apos;s also a report of a stolen vehicle at the same site .
local police are searching for him now .
according to his brother , woodbridge is where he grew up .
well , seth could be there .
find him -- now .
in the meantime , see if you can
get anything out of dechambou .
she may not know where seth is now ,
but she knows where she dropped him off last night .
i have a better suggestion -- let her go .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
god , you fbi .
when this woman was working for french intelligence ,
she was on track to be you , harold .
since she &apos;s come over to my side ,
she &apos;s only gone up from there .
you really think you &apos;re gonna be able to prove
anything against her ?
we &apos;ll make something stick . it &apos;s only a matter of time .
you don &apos;t have any time .
pick her up in a week , in a month -- next time .
but right now , if you want to save that man &apos;s life ,
you need to release dechambou .
i &apos;ll make her talk .
how ?
you don &apos;t want me to answer that .
how do i know you won &apos;t use what she says
to get seth for yourself ?
you don &apos;t .
but i don &apos;t see that you have many other options left .
okay .
release her .
but if you screw me on this --
i &apos;ll consider it a bonus .
better make it a double .
if this is about that incident in paris ...
oh , we &apos;ll always have paris .
what do you want ?
so many things .
but right now , i want some information .
where is the nsa agent ?
i have no idea .
he was handed off to the courier .
yes .
and he &apos;s been compromised .
who do you think he &apos;ll blame for that ?
not me .
the iranian must have been working with the fbi .
laurence , the iranian is dead , and you &apos;re next .
you know that .
i did nothing wrong .
the world is rarely a fair place .
that &apos;s why it needs people like me .
i &apos;ll get you out of the country and guarantee your safety .
there &apos;s a private jet awaiting your arrival right now .
in exchange , you give me the location
where you dropped the kid off last night .
he &apos;s worth $ 20 million .
that $ 20 million is about to die .
this is not a negotiation .
how dare you .
i don &apos;t care who you are .
and i &apos;m not going to let you swoop in at the last minute
and profit from a mistake made by somebody i hardly know .
oh , he knows you .
he knows where you live , where you work , where you play .
he knows you better than i do ,
and i know where that lovely little freckle is .
i give you a day and a half before he finds you .
try to be brave .
wait .
i will help you .
vehicle matches the description .
i have blood here .
all teams , we have the suspect &apos;s vehicle
on the south side of --
he &apos;s outside !
freeze !
on your knees .
freeze ! turn around !
on your knees !
hands where we can see them .
check him .
he &apos;s dead .
how much time does that kid have left ?
less than 40 minutes .
4 a.m. dechambou left seth in the back of a pickup truck .
at this rest stop in manassas .
the courier took the proof @-@ of @-@ life video
at 4 : 29 a.m. -- just under 30 minutes later .
assume he spent 20 minutes minimum with seth at the site .
that would give him 10 minutes of drive time from the rest stop ,
so he has to be somewhere in this radius .
this entire area &apos;s inaccessible .
the only place with road access is here at this open area .
he has to be here .
how much air does he have left ?
30 minutes tops .
with dembe driving ,
we might make it just in time to see him die .
if we find our nsa friend
and he &apos;s still alive ,
he might prove helpful .
you want seth for your own reasons .
so should you .
he &apos;s in the dirt .
what ?
the refrigerator -- it &apos;s a coffin .
the courier buries things under his skin .
he &apos;s in the dirt -- right here .
he &apos;s not breathing .
i died once in marrakech --
2.1 / 2 minutes .
you wouldn &apos;t believe what i saw on the other side .
who -- who are you ?
the fbi -- and friends .
seth .
we called your parents .
they &apos;re gonna meet you at the hospital .
h @-@ how can i ever repay you ?
i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll think of something .
don &apos;t even think about it .
what ? the boy wishes to express gratitude .
i &apos;m merely playing my part in the ritual .
you saved that kid &apos;s life , keen .
good job .
that story you told dechambou about ...
your job being the only thing left --
that was --
i was undercover .
i said what i had to say to sell it .
agent keen , got a delivery for you .
sign here , please .
thank you .

this man , the young nsa agent--
he allowed you access to the classified networks ?
he did .
and i understand this was a one @-@ time offer .
yes .
the right question , and we could &apos;ve made the world tremble--
finally found our adversary .
why did you waste it on the girl ?
not &quot; wasted , &quot; my friend .
circumstances are far more complex than we ever imagined .
i &apos;m betting on the long play-- the future .
your future &apos;s arriving now .
funny-- all these wonderful manuscripts ,
and my favorite thing about this place
is still the view from the sofa .
i love how the light breaks through the trees .
i don &apos;t even know why i &apos;m here .
tom ?
what &apos;s going on ?
you got to see this .
sit down .
we need to talk .
that &apos;s funny .
i was just gonna say the same thing to you .
