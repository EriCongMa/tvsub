Criminal Minds S05E02
Run you can make it!
Run! Come on!
Next.
Uh Darrin Call.
Oh I don't have anything.
No no no. I've got a refill left.
Could you just-- it's call.
Can you just check that again?
I have one refill.
No no I'm sorry.
It's not--that ain't good.
That's not good. that's not--it's just--
Are you ok?
Make it stop! Just--
Make it--
I need to make it stop!
Mr. Call--
Aren't you gonna help me?!
Here--yes here. I'm sorry.
Just please-- please stop. stop.
That's not it!
That is not it!
Hey.
Hey.
I just--
I just uh--
Hey.
Relax.
It's ok.
I just--
It's ok.
Aah! God!
Oh my god!
Oh my god are you all right?
Look what you've done!
Please somebody help him!
Put the knife down now.
He's not in yet.
What?
You've been walking past hotch's office for an hour.
Emily's picking him up.
Hotch told me he was cleared to drive.
He is.
She wants to do it.
What's going on?
He's only had a month off rossi.
Technically 34 days.
And you think that's long enough?
You don't? tell him.
No thanks. I like my job.
You like him more.
What if he's got PTSD?
He was evaluated.
Come on Rossi we wrote those questions.
Hotch knows exactly how to answer them.
So what are you gonna do
Pick apart everything he does?
How long should he be gone? a year? 2?
Every day that foyet is out there hotch loses
And you know that.
You know what that makes hotch?
Distracted.
Motivated.
Derek.
He's coming back because he has to.
He needs to know we've got his back.
He knows that.
Then we don't let him forget it.
Thanks.
Does it hurt?
It really only hurts when I think about it
which is pretty much all the time.
No no no.
Get away you.
These are for Hotch.
I get shot in the leg and I don't get any cookies.
You know he's gonna hate the attention.
It's cookies not cake.
He's probably gonna pretend like nothing happened anyway.
Well it doesn't mean we have to.
I think maybe we should.
I don't roll that way.
I've been thinking about it?
The entire time I've known hotch
I don't think I've ever seen him blink.
I know.
It's weird.
Classic alpha male behavior.
Do you think he stared down Foyet?
Maybe. If it would save his life.
Do you think he stared the whole time like with each stab?
I have no idea.
Is he ok?
I wouldn't be but...
I'm a blinker.
Spence there you are.
Grab your go bag.
What's going on?
Turn on the news.
Which one?
It doesn't matter.
Just after 8:00 this morning
40-year-old darrin call
a lifelong resident of louisville
assaulted customers at the pharmacy
on the corner of main and Truxton avenues.
Eyewitnesses saw him walking east on main street
minutes after the attack.
He has not been seen since then.
We're going to Louisville.
He was wearing a blue shirt jeans
and a light-gray jacket.
Within the hour the governor has called in all sources
for a manhunt.
Despite these statewide efforts
the suspect has eluded law enforcement.
The body count is rising. 3 are confirmed dead--
including an armed bank guard
whose gun was used in the attack.
Another 2 remain in critical condition.
The assailant is still out there.
We are going back to Eric Jennings
who's been talking to residents of Louisville--
Hey.
Hey.
What do we know about this case in Kentucky?
Uh there's no connection between call and his victims.
Louisville P.D.'s covered the city
But there hasn't been any sign of him
Since he left the pharmacy.
You check his house family?
Locals are on it.
Start with his most recent history.
Find the stressor.
Uh don't move.
Ready?
Are you?
So our point person in Louisville
Is lieutenant Kevin Mitchell.
Good morning.
Good to see you.
You too.
You look well sir. thank you.
How long do you have that?
I'm not really sure. welcome back.
Thank you.
Any other attacks?
Um no not yet.
Call's proven hard to track.
He's never had a driver's license
So he's most likely still on foot.
Or public transportation.
He's not gonna take the bus.
His face is everywhere.
Has anyone found a stressor?
He just lost his job.
He's worked at a factory since 1990.
Made appliances since forever and not a single promotion.
That's a long time to be bitter.
Or he doesn't care.
Not if he's got a family to feed.
Actually he's of the hermit variety.
As far as I can tell he's got no one.
No wife no kids no parents.
Nothing to live for.
So why hasn't he killed himself yet?
Sprees usually end in suicide.
If he's got nothing to live for why hasn't he ended it?
'cause he isn't finished yet.
We know he has displaced anger.
He took it out on the first victim.
Well the stock boy represents someone. we need to know who.
Is he military?
Negative.
Well he's lashing out for a reason.
This guy's got anger endless targets and a gun
And he's just getting started.
Emily Dickinson wrote
"one need not be a chamber to be haunted.
"one need not be a house.
The brain has corridors surpassing material place."
All right.
We've got checkpoints at the state line
On both I-64 and I-65
And within a 20-mile radius of downtown.
We think he's still on foot.
It's been just under 3 hours with an average walking speed
Of 2.5 miles per hour which rounds up
To an approximate 8-mile radius.
Now we've concentrated here.
First responders started a hard-target search
Of businesses and residences within that 8 miles.
You're gonna join 'em. you know what he looks like.
Go find him.
We dug up all we could on Darrin Call.
Even went to his apartment. didn't find much.
We've got agents over there now.
Don't worry we'll fill it in.
What's your strategy?
We try to figure out where he's headed next.
huh. you got a Crystal Ball?
Most spree killers are outwardly aggressive.
We've studied call's behavior and he's defensive.
First victim--stock boy.
Boy there's nothing defensive about that.
Actually there is.
Call doesn't react until he's touched.
And that's what set him off?
Happens every time.
Contact then stab
Contact stab.
So you're saying he didn't mean to hurt these people.
He didn't go in there with a weapon.
Well now he's got 2.
I just put his face all over the news.
People are gonna stop him themselves.
How soon can we have a press conference?
The camera crews are out front.
Great. let me call hotch.
Who's that?
Our supervisor. he's at the crime scene already.
What is it about this kid?
That's what we need to figure out.
Call's apartment is 5 minutes from the pharmacy
But there's no sign
That he came here to wash off that blood.
How's he still on the street looking like that?
Maybe he's not.
Garcia said he's got nobody. where would he go?
Call gets up he makes his bed.
We're sure he wasn't military?
It looks like one neat aspect.
Maybe he was hospitalized. I'll call garcia.
Then he's probably got the same routine every day.
Except today.
He finished his cereal walked to the pharmacy
And killed 3 people.
Why?
Mr. Call was always so quiet.
He's been coming here for years.
Had he ever had a run-in with the stock boy?
John was new here. I waved him over.
I didn't know what else to do. no one else was helping.
He didn't turn violent until you gave him his prescription?
Well it wasn't his.
You handed him a bag.
It was somebody else's.
I just wanted him to calm down.
Jj's press conference is in 5 minutes.
Hotch we might have something else here.
Why didn't you give him his own medication?
Well he didn't have any refills left.
For what?
Uh alprazolam.
But uh he used to be on thiothixene.
He was on an antipsychotic?
Well that's why I wanted him to calm down.
You said he used to be. how long has he been off of them?
At least a month.
And when were you gonna tell us this?
He's armed he's delusional.
who's his doctor?
I don't remember. my computer.
Great.
I'm sorry.
Great.
Excuse us.
Hotch.
Call jj and tell her about the meds.
This is not her fault.
Morgan he's in a psychotic break. it changes everything.
You want to talk about this?
No! I want to find him. Garcia
He's been off his antipsychotic for a month.
What else did you miss?
I'm sorry sir. I didn't get his medical records yet so--
Well find them. find everything.
Yes...
Sir.
Excuse me.
I'm in a session!
I need the pills.
Darrin what's wrong?
What happened?
He had a--a knife.
Who?
It's just like in the nightmares. he--
He's doing it again.
He can't hurt you.
We talked about this.
You want to remember.
It's why you're off the pills.
You said I would get better.
You are.
Does it look like I'm better?!
Darrin. Darrin.
I gotta...make it stop.
Make it stop!
Just make it--make it... darrin...
Calm down. That's it. Just look here.
Just breathe.
Take a breath.
He was unarmed. He didn't mean to hurt anyone.
All he wanted was his medication
But he didn't get it.
He needs help.
Who's Call's doctor?
State appointed psychiatrist Charles Cipolla.
Hotch and Morgan are on their way.
Where's his office?
Camden and third.
Cipolla's not picking up.
GPS says were 5 minutes away.
Ok Rossi we're 5 out.
tell Mitchell to meet us there.
Darrin? uhh! uhh!
Darrin?
Uhh! no!
No! get it out! darrin.
No!
Darrin!
Get it out!
No get it out!
Can't get it--
I can't get it out!
I can't--gotta--
I gotta get it out!
Darrin darrin here. here.
Darrin! darrin here.
Take my shirt. just take it.
There you go that's good.
No! Don't touch him!
No! oh my god!
No! darrin no! oh my god!
All right get out of here and check the perimeter. do it now.
We're too late.
Hotch!
He cleaned up changed his clothes
Could have dyed his hair for all I know.
Call's suffering from a psychotic break.
He's not dodging us on purpose.
Oh come on.
Trust me.
If he was psychotic
Why would his doctor take him off the drugs?
Call has no history of violent behavior.
Cipolla couldn't predict that would happen.
Look at this place.
Yeah it's a mess.
no it's more than that.
Call was looking for something.
Yeah the drugs.
Doctor doesn't keep the drugs here.
Scrip pad is still on his desk.
My guess is he came here for help.
His file's missing.
Yeah baby girl what's going on?
Where's hotch? he's not answering.
He's outside. he's all right.
Are you sure?
Yeah. what's up?
A mystery.
Come on not today garcia.
I know. here's the deal.
When I missed the antipsychotics--
Listen to me. that was not your fault.
You are ever my champion sugar
But I believe it was.
Anyway when I did that I went back to the beginning
For call except there is no beginning.
Wait a minute.
Rossi.
Say that again.
What are you talking about?
Darrin call didn't exist like from 1969 to 1975.
There's no birth certificate no social security
No identity nothing until he was 6 years old.
Was he abandoned?
My least 3 favorite words strung together--
I don't know.
My guess is neither does he.
I should have seen the blinking on the video.
Well it could have been a nervous tic.
But it wasn't. it's a classic sign
Of long-term antipsychotic use and I missed it.
We all did.
Well regardless those men died.
Garcia's got something.
May 1.1975 a 6-year-old Darrin Call
Was found roaming in the middle of nowhere and was picked up
And was in state care for the first few months.
Did he tell the cops what happened?
No. because he didn't talk
Not for over a year. and once he started talking
He only knew his life as darrin call.
That's awful.
So is this. little Darrin was never claimed.
Maybe he wasn't from the area.
There wasn't a thriving missing children's network in 1975.
Call is wearing Cipolla's clothing.
You think he's lucid?
No mostly likely he's just freaked out.
Either way we should update the public.
You should be there too.
What is this?
Call's timeline.
he left louisville?
3 times.
Always came back to the same 10-block radius.
Why?
Victims are often drawn to the scene of their first trauma.
Part of him wanted to escape
The other part probably struggled to find answers.
Was he hospitalized?
Uh 1985 for 2 years.
Yeah. and again in '95 for a few months
Both at the state facility in fayette county.
You know he doesn't drive.
You think he'd walk all the way out there?
He's desperate. he'll find a way.
Well then I'll tell the sheriff in fayette.
When did he start the prescriptions Garcia?
In 1977 and it looks like he tried them all.
I've got a list.
Alphabetically alprazolam
Clonazepam diazepam--
just send it.
yes sir.
His doctor weaned him off the prescription for a reason.
Now that's a big risk so the reward must have been greater.
He needs the truth.
He took his file.
He's got some answers.
And a head start.
Well we need to catch up.
Records from child services
Has him extremely physically abused.
No signs of sexual assault.
That's a miracle.
Either way the trauma was debilitating.
Was he running from an abusive home or an abduction?
Wouldn't there be a paper trail if it were a kidnapping?
Garcia look for unsolved missing children's cases from the 1970s.
Now there was a case
In hollow creek. kids were dead though.
Found them in pieces.
when was this?
'75.
Nobody talks about it 'cause they never found the guy.
You think Call walked away from that?
It's possible.
Garcia send me everything.
Done.
Can you find the case file?
I'll do what I can.
You're it!
Come on.
Wait up!
Is there a suspect list?
It's in here somewhere.
He was known as the hollow creek killer.
3 bodies were found some never identified.
Oh god he used lime to dispose--
There's a survivor.
Call?
No a 12-year-old boy named Tommy Phillips.
Parents said he'd been missing for 2 weeks
Came back a different kid.
Of course he did.
Let's see. the family left louisville
After Tommy told police where to find the bodies.
He also said the suspect was a white man in his 30s
And drove a red pickup truck.
We need to find Tommy.
He'd be 46 now.
His parents probably changed his name
And got as far away as possible.
Garcia can find him.
Don't get your hopes up.
Garcia everything you can find
On a Tommy Phillips.
The victims had cuts.
The stock boy's blade
Is what set him off in the pharmacy.
If this is what call's been running from
It's no wonder he's blocked it out.
Since he's clean now there's no medication
To block his memories and he wants answers.
Where would he go?
To what he knows.
He doesn't know anything.
That's the problem.
He's beginning to. 1975 sterner orphanage.
It's where he became Darrin Call.
Yes?
There was a nice man here Mr. Cureton.
I need to see him.
I'm sorry he retired years ago.
Well where did he go?
I don't know. I'm sorry.
you gotta know!
He didn't just leave.
I'm sorry sir but I told you he's not here.
Come on kids homework!
Come on.
Come on.
Would you please leave? the children are coming in. please.
Come on. Come on. Straight to the books.
Right to it. Straight to the back and we'll sit down.
He's here.
He's here.
Who?
What are you talking about?
Nobody's here.
He's here.
I just--
Oh careful Ryan.
Come on you can make it!
Come on! Come on come on!
Tommy Tommy
We gotta go.
No wait--
Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!
Come on Tommy.
Somebody help!
We gotta run!
Somebody!
Thank you.
He called the boy Tommy.
Is that what set him off?
She thought it was his reflection.
Whoever hurt him years ago
Might have been the same age he is now.
He might have seen the similarity.
What about the boy?
His real name is Ryan.
She said he's quiet and submissive.
Is Morgan getting anything
Out of the other witness?
Not yet.
A minivan was stolen one block from here.
Call's never driven in his life.
You think he's still not running from us?
Which way?
Eastbound. I got roadblocks set up everywhere.
He's not getting out of this county.
You're wasting your time.
He's outnumbered.
You think he's gonna just disappear?
I think he took the boy for a reason.
I don't care why he took him.
You should.
Call's memory is no longer suppressed.
He's reinventing his past
And unless we understand how
We're not gonna find either of them.
Well I'm not gonna just sit around and speculate.
Then don't.
You don't think we should chase him either?
We need to get ahead of Call.
There's a kid missing.
They don't need the extra manpower.
Since when?
If we'd studied Foyet's initial crimes
We would have known that a survivor didn't make sense.
What does he have to do with this?
All we had to do was stop and look at Foyet's history
And we didn't
And we lost two couples and a bus full of people.
And I'm not making that mistake again.
They're gonna find us.
Where? you saw 'em? where?
Who?
Where did you seem 'em?
who?
Where did you see 'em?! where?!
Please just let me go.
I'm sorry Tommy.
Just--
We just gotta-- we gotta--
Just--ohh--we gotta--
We gotta hurry Tommy
'Cause he's gonna get us and we just--
We just gotta--uhh--
So what do we know?
There were only 4 suspects in the hollow creek case
And they're all dead.
The kids were taken in 1973 '74 and '75.
And all on the way home from school.
Different school districts.
He waited for them to be alone.
That takes patience.
He must have had time off in the afternoons.
He lived or worked near the schools.
That's a lot of doors to knock on.
You think Call's going back there?
I think there's a good chance.
I'll tell Mitchell.
Where's the secondary location?
He needed seclusion to do what he did.
Go ahead Garcia. You're on speaker.
I found Tommy. He goes by James Thomas Anderson now.
Is he local?
One county over. Address and bio are coming...now.
Thanks Garcia.
What does Darrin Call have to do with me?
We think he survived the hollow creek murders.
Nobody survived that.
You did.
There was another boy.
He was 6.
No that's not true.
We don't have time for this.
I'm telling you I was alone.
Just like now?
Excuse me?
Have you ever been married?
Any relationships? Any family?
What does that have to do with anything?
Or are you afraid you'll abandon them too?
Or was it because of your alcoholism?
I would never leave a kid.
Did he cry too much?
Was he too slow? what was it?
How could you leave a 6-year-old all alone?
I was only 12 years old.
He's been taking medications to deal with the trauma
That suppressed his memories.
That kind of amnesia is a psychological defense.
He's gonna wish he never remembered.
We know what you told the police.
We need to know about the boy.
He never talked.
Hey! hey kid.
Hey kid.
Is the old man passed out yet?
Can you reach those?
Good. good. good.
Good.
Ok. bring 'em. please.
Bring 'em here.
Go ahead you can do it.
Right there. good.
Ok.
Come on. come on!
Come here.
Grab the shovel.
Hey come here!
Quit struggling!
Come here.
Get out of there.
Come on.
Come on!
Come on you can make it!
Come on you can make it!
Come on!
Come on!
Aah! go tommy! run!
Go tommy! run!
Go tommy! run!
I'd never heard his voice before.
He told you to go.
He was a kid.
So were you.
Call wasn't in the back with you.
No he was in the cab.
He gave you water.
Got the keys.
Why wasn't he locked up?
Maybe call wasn't a victim.
Call's reflection.
Oh god.
His father was the hollow creek killer.
His own kid?
No wonder he was never claimed.
How did the father explain his son just disappeared?
Could have said he ran away.
The mother would have reported him missing.
Maybe he said the boy died.
She'd want a funeral.
What if there wasn't one?
Morgan call garcia.
Ask her to check death records
From 1969 to 1975.
for who?
for the mother.
Go tommy! run!
Go tommy run!
You think you can get away?!
Is that what you think?!
You stupid little bastard.
Have you narrowed it down?
Oh 6 years is a long time.
I need more parameters.
She lived within that 8-mile radius.
She was married. she was most likely in her twenties.
He was probably her only kid.
The husband drove a red truck.
Ok. this could be one.
Here we go doris jarvis. died in childbirth.
And let me guess-- she had a boy.
Yeah.
Baby girl I'm gonna put you on speaker.
Guys.
Ok so doris jarvis
Was married to bill jarvis.
He owned a machine shop just outside the city.
That could be the secondary location.
It closed in 1980.
He hasn't done anything since.
I guess he laid low.
He had a red pickup
Until 1976 when he bought a black one.
I know that because that's what he was driving
When he was arrested for duis.
He was locked up from '77 to '80
And I'm sending his picture now.
And that could certainly be darrin call's father.
Where's jarvis now?
In the same house. 1457 hitchens avenue.
Let's go.
...that's gonna do it.
There's no energy shortage here.
His third shot of the 1975 season.
We'd like to remind you--
You're late.
of the game of the day.
Patterson still walking around the mound.
We're not quite sure what is happening.
He's behind the count now
Three balls one strike
With a man on first and second
Here in the bottom of the eighth.
I knew you'd come home.
Lieutenant.
The kid's in there. we've got this.
Tactical teams are covering the exits.
Call needs a distraction.
He's focused on the old man.
For now. but we're gonna have to figure out
The safest way to get that kid out.
I've got a team in the back
And one on the way.
We're going to infiltrate.
You do that and someone else dies.
Either call or a child murderer--
Flip a coin.
It doesn't have to end like that.
We get a confession out of jarvis and he goes away
And call gets his answers.
No one else has to die.
Hotch.
Hotch.
Hotch!
What the hell is he doing?!
Let him go.
Rossi I'm not letting him go in there solo.
We have to trust him.
We can do this together.
Get out!
My name's Aron.
This is between us and him.
I know.
Then you leave us alone.
I know what he did to those boys.
I know about hollow creek and the cage.
And Tommy.
You know about Tommy?
Come on you can make it!
Come on! come on!
We're gonna get him back for everything that he done tommy.
Every single thing.
Let him go. Tommy doesn't need to see this.
He should die.
He should. But if you kill him
You have nothing and I thought you wanted some answers.
What's he doing?
Stalling.
He's got nothing to lose.
Go ahead Darrin ask him.
Why did you do that to those kids?
What kids?
No!
The ones that we buried. why?!
You're confused.
No! unh!
Jarvis why didn't you move?
This is my home.
You sure it's not the view?
Darrin come here.
Come take a look at this.
He sits on the porch every day and watches those kids.
He can't help himself.
You got the shot?
Negative.
Damn it.
What's he doing?
Bringing the boy out.
Let's get Hotch out of there.
That's his call.
We--we drove around in that truck.
You made your own son
Sit in front so the other boys would feel safe?
You--you kept them in cages.
I burnt their clothes.
And when you finished you'd bury them
And you made him help.
And--
Get up. Pretend you're a man.
You like little boys don't you?
But they can't be too small
'cause that would be wrong.
What was it about them? They make you feel strong
Make you feel like a man?
You shut up.
Is that a yes?
Darrin.
We're surrounded here.
The police are gonna storm in here any minute.
They will not shoot you if you are unarmed.
You need to put the gun down now.
Don't--don't--
Tell me what to do!
Uhh! don't--uhh--
Go go!
What happened?
I couldn't stop him.
It's over.
For now.
There's someone I think you should talk to.
Tommy?
I'm so sorry.
What for?
For running away.
We both ran.
Yeah but I left you behind.
He could have killed you.
He didn't.
'cause I wasn't afraid of him anymore.
You've changed everything Tommy.
You're the one that I waited for.
You're the one that saved me.
"There is no witness so dreadful
"no accuser so terrible
As the conscience that dwells in the heart of every man."
Polybius.
I know what you want to talk about.
2 months ago we wouldn't be breaking down Hotch's decisions.
There'd be no doubt.
2 months ago he had everything to live for Rossi.
Now his family's just been taken away.
How is he supposed to think about anything else?
How long is he gonna let foyet win? hmm?
I mean come on by the time we catch this guy
Hotch could be more scarred on the inside than he is the outside.
Hotch took a risk.
But we saved that boy.
He put his life at risk in there
In ways that we are never supposed to and you know it.
I'm not about to stand by and watch this man kill himself.
And you won't.
Rossi...
If Hotch is gone
Foyet's got no one else to torture. Hotch wins.
But if Hotch lives but doesn't get to watch his son grow up
Hotch loses.
You didn't have to walk me up here you know.
I know.
So you think Call's gonna be ok?
I don't know.
He got his answers.
He killed the man who haunted him.
And what else is there?
The years of torture.
Think he'll get over that?
How could he?
But at least he doesn't have to feel like he's alone anymore.
He doesn't have anyone.
He has Tommy.
He's not alone.
Get some sleep.
