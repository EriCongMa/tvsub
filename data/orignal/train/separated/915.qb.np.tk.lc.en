ah , the &apos; 80s --
a time before you could magically download music ,
and your stereo was your pride and joy .
just one problem -- tapes cost a fortune ,
so i only owned two ,
both of which were the &quot; cocktail &quot; soundtrack .
luckily , back then , there was a way to get free music .
and coming in at number 2 , chicago .
waiting for three hours to record it right off the radio .
unfortunately , in my house , that wasn &apos;t so easy .
hey , hey , barry , do you mind ? i &apos;m recording chicago .
you won &apos;t hear a thing . look at my hands .
these are the fingers of a surgeon .
not cool , funny bone ! not cool !
i &apos;m home ! the tv &apos;s mine !
dad , i &apos;m recording music .
and i &apos;m watching a very special &quot; gilligan &apos;s island &quot;
where the harlem globetrotters come to visit .
please , just give me three minutes .
i &apos;ve always loved gilligan ,
and i love meadowlark lemon .
i never thought the two of them would meet .
damn it !
can you at least try to -- - i hate you and this house .
i didn &apos;t even do anything .
oh , well , i suppose the car just dented itself .
come on , man !
like i &apos;m supposed to believe ...
... they built a basketball court on the island !
my own daughter ...
damn it !
damn it ! darn it !
that &apos;s obviously stupid .
apparently ...
yep , it seemed i would never get to enjoy the music i liked
until one company changed everything .
columbia house .
my god ! how did you get
all those tapes on a lawn mower &apos;s salary ?
they got this catalog filled with albums ,
and they just give you 12 tapes for a penny .
that deal defies all reason .
i know . i got them all --
abba to zappa .
&apos;sup , pretty eyes ?
not much , dk .
sweet tapes .
yeah .
i don &apos;t know , man .
there &apos;s , like , a bunch of legal stuff here .
dave kim doesn &apos;t read the fine print .
he lives in the moment .
tapes !
it had to be too good to be true .
so i went to the biggest con artist in my family --
my big sister .
sure , you get a bunch of tapes up front ,
but then you enter into a contract
to order more for full price .
in the end , columbia house always comes for you .
man , i bet they have like ex @-@ navy seals
to collect their money .
i think you &apos;re giving them too much credit .
point is you can &apos;t get something for free .
sure you can .
what you do is go into a store ,
take a bunch of stuff , and then just walk out .
yeah , that &apos;s called stealing .
that &apos;s called stealing .
that &apos;s what you sound like .
wait , wait .
what if i give columbia house a fake name
and take the 12 tapes ?
well , it &apos;s illegal , but very clever .
yes ! then let &apos;s do this !
as much as i would love to commit mail fraud with you ,
mom &apos;s really been on my back lately .
aw , come on . commit a felony with me .
it &apos;ll be a good bonding experience ,
or at the very least a cautionary tale .
your little brother &apos;s hardcore .
yeah , a hardcore nerd .
not anymore , erica .
face it -- now i &apos;m a certified badass .
schmoopie . &quot; muppet babies &quot; is on .
yippee !
it was march 16 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and my brother went to pick up his girlfriend , lainey .
one problem -- he had to get by her dad first .
lainey !
the scream @-@ y kid with the crazy eyebrows is here .
special night . it &apos;s our 10 @-@ month anniversary .
anniversaries are for years , not months ,
so you &apos;re celebrating nothing .
let me see your wallet .
here , take it .
$ 6 ?
where do you plan to take her tonight ?
a vending machine at a bus station ?
oh , it &apos;s fine . she usually pays .
hey , bar .
nope ! absolutely not !
shutting it down .
if that jacket hits the floor tonight , so do you .
okay , kids , have a great time .
even though barry had won the love of his life ,
it was becoming clear he had not won over her dad .
yet .
nothing like a cold one after work , am i right ?
amen to that , brother !
love me the old brew ha @-@ ha , nectar of the gods ,
foam hammer , wheat and greet , little truth water ,
golden problem solver , beer .
move over , rover .
are you telling me you drink ?
no !
you just said you love cold suds .
so which is it ? are you a lush or a liar ?
he &apos;s a moron .
i &apos;m gonna grab us a refill , mur .
you want a six pack , mickey mantle ?
why ?
i &apos;m probably being a little paranoid ,
but it kind of seems like bill hates my living guts .
hoo @-@ hoo ! he sure does !
i don &apos;t get it .
mom says i &apos;m literally a human ray of sunshine .
your mom &apos;s a nice lady ,
but she &apos;s done some real damage to you .
i need bill to be my friend .
he &apos;s like a father to lainey .
you &apos;re the boyfriend .
no dad likes the guy who &apos;s dating his daughter .
so it &apos;s not personal .
yes !
top shelf .
yeah , throw this away .
no .
i &apos;ll time you .
okay , got to beat my record .
while barry was happily distracted ,
i was focused on pulling off the biggest scam ever .
dude , what are you doing ?
i &apos;ve had a revelation .
why create one fake name and get 12 tapes ,
when you can create infinite fake names
and get all the tapes ?
are you sure this is a good idea ?
i &apos;ve thought of everything , erica .
see , columbia house has agents everywhere
looking to collect their money .
but i &apos;ll be one step ahead of them with this .
each of my phony identities
has elaborately fleshed @-@ out backstories
that i &apos;ve completely committed to memory .
optimus o &apos;prime ? really , dude ?
whose first name is optimus ?
this guy .
he &apos;s a 41 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver
who spends his long nights on the road
jamming to the soft @-@ rock stylings of chicago .
ugh , why ?
because i &apos;m playing god , erica .
meet dr. garth vaderstein .
he &apos;s got asthma and issues with his son .
he &apos;s also got an insane love of hall &amp; oates .
well , we all have hobbies .
next , meet stu voltron , age 43 .
he &apos;s a divorced veterinarian .
the only thing he loves more than animals ?
billy joel .
i think maybe you should pump the brakes
on your life of crime .
i think you should beat it , narc .
yay , tapes .
for mere pennies , i had enough soft rock
for two lifetimes .
that &apos;s a whole lot of music cassettes .
how did you get the money for all that ?
do you want to ask questions ?
or do you want a little neil diamond ?
i saw nothing .
good answer .
as i was in way over my head ,
barry was trying to make some headway with bill .
there he is .
it &apos;s happening .
he &apos;s changed his mind about me .
anthony balsamo , you old son of a gun .
where you been ? why don &apos;t you come around anymore ?
&apos;cause your beautiful daughter broke up with me .
ah , women -- who can understand them ?
hey , when am i gonna see you out on the links again ?
my buddy and i have a tee time this weekend .
you should caddy for me .
keep this duffer on the green .
look out !
i hate it when my dad talks golf with my ex .
they used to do it all the time when we dated .
your dad liked him while you two were dating ?
i thought he hated me &apos; cause i &apos;m your boyfriend .
oh , sweetie , no .
my dad hates you as , like , a person .
you being my boyfriend is just a happy coincidence .
well , don &apos;t worry .
i know a man who &apos;s got the inside track on your dad ,
and he &apos;ll be more than happy to help me .
mmmmm , yeah , uh ...
what is that ? is that a yes or a no ?
yeaaaa @-@ no ...
you &apos;re mashing yes and no together .
speak clearly in english words .
no ... yeah , uh ...
come on , dad .
you &apos;re bill &apos;s best friend . just talk to him for me .
talk ? we mostly sit in comfortable silence and drink .
you never once told him
how cool or funny or athletic i am ?
you know , it &apos;s never come up , and i don &apos;t think it ever will .
can you at least tell him how good i am
at getting all the shampoo out of my hair in the shower ?
as a favor to you , no .
did you tell him how i can palm a volleyball ?
no , &apos; cause you can &apos;t do it consistently .
tell him how good i am at all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat shrimp .
that red lobster hates me -- tell him .
no .
fine .
if you &apos;re not gonna tell him about me ,
at least tell me about him .
all i can tell you is he likes cheesesteaks and the cowboys .
that &apos;s all you know about him ?
oh ! he also likes john denver .
perfect .
who are you ? dr. doom ?
and so my brother was scheming to win over bill .
meanwhile , my mom was about to get wise to my scheme .
got a package for papa smurfenstein .
i think you &apos;ve got the wrong address .
i suppose that means there &apos;s also
no inspector gidget ?
no .
gary grayskull ?
no .
snake plotkin ?
no .
ivan drago ?
no .
john mcclaneberg ?
no .
hulk hulkerstein ?
no .
general zod ?
no .
jean claude van thunderdome ?
what &apos;s going on ?
let me guess .
you have teenagers ?
well , one of them &apos;s been using
a lot of fake names to get free tapes .
well , i think it &apos;s obvious who &apos;s responsible .
me ? !
yes , you .
who else would it be ?
kermit d . fonz ?
that &apos;s got adam written all over it .
you expect me to believe that adam did this ?
yes .
adam ?
adam .
my delicious little snuggle monster ?
yes , adam .
adam ?
he &apos;s guilty . tell her you &apos;re guilty .
why does she say these things , mama ?
i &apos;m just a little boy .
see ? he has an alibi . he &apos;s a little boy .
why do you always blame me for everything ?
just open the box and look at the tapes ,
and you &apos;ll see it wasn &apos;t me .
weird al , &quot; the songs of &apos; fraggle rock , &apos; &quot;
&quot; the best of andrew lloyd webber , &quot;
and , finally , &quot; 101 farts , volume 2 . &quot;
hope it was worth it , erica . you &apos;re grounded for a month .
no phone , no crimper .
a month with smooth hair ? are you crazy ?
tell her !
okay , fine . i @-@ it really was me .
i @-@ it was such a good deal .
i got caught in the heat of the moment .
which is also a song i got for a fraction of a penny .
shh , you don &apos;t have to lie for her anymore .
seriously ?
what ?
let mama make you a banana split .
okay ? you get nothing .
oof , tough break .
take sheila e . for your troubles .
this is ridiculous .
why do i always get blamed
for everything that goes wrong in this house ?
&apos;cause you do most of it .
you know , if mom thinks i &apos;m so bad ,
maybe it &apos;s time to show her how bad i can really be .
wait , this was you holding back ?
oh , this is not good .
tired of being labeled in an the troublemaker ,
my sister decided to live up to her name .
wow , yeah , okay .
let &apos;s do this . let &apos;s shoplift .
trust me -- it &apos;s super fun and easy .
and also the only thing that really makes me feel alive .
ooh ! fanny packs .
i mean , how much worse is shoplifting than scamming columbia house anyway ?
getting 12 tapes for a penny
is like the same thing as shoplifting .
just a tip --
maybe don &apos;t say &quot; shoplifting &quot; so much while you &apos;re shoplifting .
right , gotcha .
&apos;cause we &apos;re not shoplifting ,
which is , by the way , totally a victimless crime .
i &apos;m hearing a lot of justifying and not a lot of stealing .
catch up , girl .
yep , my sister was ready for a life of crime
just as barry was preparing to steal bill &apos;s heart .
gentlemen !
thought you might like to load up on some meat and cheese
before an active day in the hot sun .
you &apos;re a fan , right , bill ?
of geno &apos;s cheesesteaks . you bought pat &apos;s .
why not just punch me in the face ?
aren &apos;t they directly across the street from each other
with the exact same ingredients ?
go on -- punch my face . do it .
or we go to the eagles @-@ cowboys game .
50 @-@ yard line , root for america &apos;s team ?
i thought you were a diehard eagles fan .
until i discovered the cowboys ,
my other favorite team , which happens to be yours .
you &apos;re gonna turn on the eagles just like that ?
son , don &apos;t you have any spine at all ?
no . but you know what i do have ?
matching bucket hats !
why ?
oh , no .
&apos;cause you love bob denver .
you know , gilligan , from the island .
what ?
he &apos;s my favorite , too .
i don &apos;t like bob denver . i like john denver .
is there a difference ?
oh , no .
yes , one is folk icon who melts my heart .
the other is a scrawny weirdo
who couldn &apos;t close with ginger or mary ann .
i totally know the difference .
i &apos;m just busting chops .
i just got you this hat so your head won &apos;t burn .
are you calling me bald ?
no , you have a beautiful head of hair .
on the sides .
you look like a judge .
well , it &apos;s almost tee time .
come on , barry . you &apos;re gonna come with us today .
he is ?
i am ?
yeah , i invited the boy to join us .
you did ?
you did ?
yeah , barry and i play golf all the time .
it &apos;s our thing .
i &apos;ve never golfed with you , not once .
moron , i &apos;m doing you a solid .
don &apos;t blow this .
my dad did barry the rare solid .
now all barry had to do was drive it home with bill .
ah , golf . the sport of kings .
and queens -- equal rights .
i respect your foxy daughter .
no , not foxy -- she &apos;s an uggo to me .
not everyone else .
they all think she has an awesome , plump butt .
what the man ?
okay , you &apos;re trying way too hard .
i get it -- be myself .
no , don &apos;t do that either .
wild bill !
you need a caddy ?
there he is .
anthony balsamo &apos;s here ?
i can &apos;t compete with him . he &apos;s a total babe .
relax , you &apos;re playing golf with bill .
he &apos;s just the caddy .
you &apos;re right .
he &apos;s the caddy -- the guy behind the guy .
he &apos;s the one in bill &apos;s ear whispering sweet advice .
that &apos;s what i got to do .
not what i meant .
hey , pretty boy . take a lap , i got this .
just give me a sec . i &apos;ll catch up .
hey , i got a package for lucky goldberg .
gonna need your signature .
yeah , lucky &apos;s a dog .
then i don &apos;t know what to do .
please don &apos;t slam the door .
the nerve of that erica .
first she frames her brother ,
and then she ropes in our sweet little puppy .
you &apos;re not cut out for a life of crime .
you &apos;re just a cockapoo .
i ordered the tapes .
i mean , it &apos;s like that girl doesn &apos;t ever hear a word i say .
i ordered the tapes .
she &apos;s my daughter .
how come she refuses to listen to me ?
my god , woman . i ordered the damn tapes .
i saw adam do it , and i wanted in .
wait . it was you ?
with that , my mom finally realized
she did blame erica for everything ,
even when she was clearly innocent .
uh , mom ?
it &apos;s for you . erica &apos;s in mall jail .
and two seconds later , erica was back to being guilty .
i stole something else , but you &apos;re never gonna find it .
your friend &apos;s weird .
there you are .
classic erica .
you know , i actually started to think
maybe i &apos;d been too hard on you , and then you go and shoplift ?
and the worst thing is i &apos;m not even surprised .
actually , your daughter didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
i was just having her stick around
because this one is freaking me out .
it &apos;s true .
erica tried to talk me out of it , and i didn &apos;t listen .
oh , god , my stomach &apos;s in knots .
can i use the bathroom ?
this way .
accusing erica yet again didn &apos;t help matters .
luckily , my mom had a way with words .
so ...
honest mistake , you know ?
pedicures , my treat ?
you know , you made me feel like such a bad person
that i actually thought about stealing .
schmoo , i &apos;m sorry --
i don &apos;t want to hear you &apos;re sorry ever again .
no matter what i do ,
you &apos;re always gonna expect the worst from me .
you have no idea how hard that is coming from you .
no idea .
you &apos;ll never catch me , mall hog !
i feel so alive !
even though bill lewis was having the round of his life ,
my brother was having no luck breaking the ice .
being a caddy sucks .
all bill wants me to do is wash his balls and hold his bag .
it &apos;s funny but hard work .
i told you not to caddy for him .
i messed this whole thing up .
i &apos;ll never get another shot with bill .
all right . i &apos;m gonna help you .
for real ?
yeah .
but this counts as your birthday present .
hey , bill . tweaked my shoulder .
barry &apos;s gonna finish the round for me .
gonna use a driver on this one .
you &apos;re 60 yards out .
don &apos;t use my expensive driver for this chip shot .
unh @-@ unh @-@ unh @-@ unh , no talking in my backswing .
i learned that after i did it to you three times .
it was now or never .
barry would have to dig down deep inside himself
and do the impossible .
son of a bitch .
that &apos;s about right .
it &apos;s okay . i got this .
way colder than i thought .
as barry desperately flailed in that murky golf pond ,
my dad realized the kid really needed a life preserver .
starting to see why you call him moron so much .
yeah , well , the thing is
he &apos;s the sweetest moron you &apos;d ever want to meet .
and he loves your daughter --
so much that he &apos;d do anything to impress you .
i &apos;m feeling around with my feet .
it &apos;s mostly old golf balls
and something with scales that &apos;s not afraid of humans .
so , please , cut the kid some slack .
i think i drowned a little .
it was a very peaceful feeling .
i saw my old gerbil . i &apos;m going back in .
there &apos;s my baby .
i made you your favorite -- cheeseburger lasagna .
pass .
i don &apos;t want to get blamed if you burn it ,
so i &apos;ll just eat a lunchable .
but ... those are for lunch .
it &apos;s the wrong meal .
wow , you really have failed as a mother .
hey . i &apos;m the only one allowed to say that .
well , it &apos;s true .
you punished erica for something i did ,
almost turning her to a life a crime .
if that ain &apos;t failing , i don &apos;t know what is .
oh , you &apos;re right .
i want to tell her i &apos;m sorry ,
but she refuses to hear it from me .
it dawned on me that i could finally use my crime for good .
maybe there &apos;s someone else who can say it .
thanks to my scam ,
there was one tape that was worth every penny .
and it was the perfect way to say &quot; i &apos;m sorry . &quot;
honey .
go away .
i &apos;m trying to enjoy my four crackers and ham square .
look .
i don &apos;t blame for acting out after the way i treated you .
i really don &apos;t want to talk right now -- or ever .
well , you don &apos;t have to
because i found a band that &apos;ll do it for us .
sure , columbia house drove erica and my mom far apart .
but it would also bring them closer than ever .
* everybody needs a little time away *
no , not chicago .
* i heard her say *
stop doing what you &apos;re doing .
* far away from their mother *
don &apos;t make the words about you .
* hold me , schmoo *
this is a nightmare .
* it &apos;s hard for me to say i &apos;m sorry *
* i just want you to stay *
this is the worst .
* after all that we &apos;ve been through *
* i will make it up to you *
* i promise to *
* and after all that &apos;s been said and done *
* you &apos;re just the part of me i can &apos;t let go *
and with the help of one soft @-@ rock band ,
my mom was truly able to say sorry .
* couldn &apos;t stand to be kept away *
there he is . you old son of a gun .
are you talking to me ?
yeah .
hey , sweetie . can i have a minute with my caddy ?
no .
be nice .
listen .
i know i &apos;ve been hard on you , but there &apos;s a reason .
&apos;cause i &apos;m not awesome like anthony balsamo ?
no .
to tell the truth ,
i knew those other guys were just a flash in the pan .
but what you two have , it &apos;s the real deal .
you think so ?
yeah . it &apos;s ... scary .
i guess i &apos;m just not ready to lose my little girl .
but i &apos;m gonna try to be better about it .
inspired by the girl they both loved ,
bill decided to start a new chapter with barry .
as for me , i closed the book on my life of crime .
not so fun getting grounded for a month , huh ?
honestly , it &apos;s a relief . i was on a dark road .
farewell , garth vaderstein .
nice knowing you .
don &apos;t talk to him , erica . he &apos;s grounded .
you know , you could learn a thing or two from you big sister .
and my mom finally turned a new page with erica .
i really could .
made you a banana split .
you get nothing .
hey , jailbird . want to split this ?
i would like that .
growing up , we &apos;re all seen a certain way .
yes ! mark it down -- octuple bogey !
but the people you love always see you for who you really are .
he &apos;s a moron .
he really is .
and that &apos;s something worth celebrating .
this is my tapes , my other tapes .
welcome to contempo casuals .
did you find all the hot styles you were looking for today ?
what ? since when do you work here ?
i had no choice .
i &apos;m into columbia house -- deep .
they send me letters every day . i owe them hundreds .
i told you to read the fine print , dave kim .
shh ! don &apos;t say my name !
they have agents everywhere .
look , that girl checking out the stirrup pants .
she &apos;s here for me .
i don &apos;t have your money , man .
i &apos;ll get it ! just give me time !
i need more time .
