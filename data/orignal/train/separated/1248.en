We're building a rat trap.
And you're the cheese.
"Leave my friends alone. I killed Charlotte."
I didn't wanna think that's what happened.
There's gonna be a lock on that box tomorrow.
But it's not what it looks like. I promise you.
Save your lies for someone who has time to hear them.
I told Spencer it was okay if she and Caleb got together.
How did this get so complicated?
You're writing a book with the guy
you used to be in love with.
It's about his dead girlfriend.
I never stopped loving you.
If I'd just come back a few minutes earlier.
You're not real.
It wasn't my fault.
Mary Drake is a patient here.
She had a child named Charles.
Your mom and Wilden are dead.
They came back for me.
You're the only man my daughter ever loved.
I would have done anything for Charlotte.
Hanna!
Han!
"Thanks for giving me Hanna."
"You're free to go." "A.D."
How could we let this happen?
Oh, my God, poor Hanna.
Try to remember that it's what she'd want.
No, I don't know if I can live with this.
I mean, how can we bury..
There has to be another way.
There is no other way, Emily.
It was a well thought-out plan and when it ends up like this
it's called first-degree murder.
Look, Spencer is right.
Come on.
第七季第一集
Toby, you speak cops. You should do the talking.
Wait, Toby, your job is on the line here.
You sure that you wanna be a part of this?
Are you serious, Spencer? Hanna's life is on the line.
When you asked me for my help, I said I was all in. I still am.
Alright, we're wasting time. Let's go.
Guys, hold up.
Alison's not the only one seeing ghosts tonight.
Maybe she wasn't seeing ghosts at all.
Unless we're under a body-snatcher invasion
that's a real person.
When they dug up Mrs. D in my backyard
she wasn't just a little bit dead
she was rotting-corpse dead.
Whoever the hell that is, she was at the Lost Woods tonight.
If she's a part of this, she knows where Hanna is
and I will beat the truth out of her if I have to.
No, no, no, you can't just walk in there
and start throwing punches.
Just, just give me a minute. Let me find out why she's here.
And who she is or what she is.
Hi. Officer Cavanaugh.
How can I help you?
I'm the new owner of the Lost Woods Resort
and I need to report a break-in.
Hmm. I have to ask.
You're a dead ringer for a woman who used to live here.
Jessica was my sister.
She's Jessica's twin, Mary Drake.
From the Radley file.
She's Charlotte's biological mom.
So why're we still standing here?
She thinks Hanna killed her daughter.
She's A.D.
Maybe.
But she's one step ahead of us.
She just bought the Lost Woods
and she's in there filing a report about a break-in.
By us.
Damn it.
"A lie for a lie, an eye for an eye."
"The bell tolls for Hanna."
"A.D."
No! No!
Oh, my God.
Hanna.
No!
No, Hanna!
Oh, my God.
Hanna.
Toby.
Come on.
Come on.
Be careful.
Oh, my God.
Hanna.
Hanna.
Hanna.
Be careful.
Be careful.
Hanna.
This isn't happening.
She's dead.
Hanna.
Oh, my God. Hanna.
It's a mask.
What?
It isn't Hanna.
What do you mean?
Oh, my God.
What?
So where the hell's Hanna?
What's this?
You've got 24 hours to give me Charlotte's real killer
or Hanna dies.
Tick-tock, bitches.
What do we do?
Oh, my God.
Okay, so my parents are about to board
their post-election victory cruise
so we can make this place command central.
Look, we've been trying to figure out
who killed Charlotte since she died.
Do we really think that we're gonna solve
that mystery in under 24 hours?
Yes. We will because we have to.
This is the first time we've all been working together.
That's what makes it different.
That and a creepy twin.
Mary has to be A.D.
What bigger motive is there?
And she has to be working with someone.
While she was running around the woods last night
somebody else dragged Hanna out of that motel room.
Guys, Mona's right.
It's just like Ali told Hanna.
All of us working together knew what happened to her.
So all of us together can figure out
who killed Charlotte.
I'm sure each one of us has some idea about who did it.
Don't we?
Is there somebody out there?
No. Please!
Please open the door.
You can't leave me in here. I'm begging you.
Please!
"Alison."
"Alison."
"Alison."
"No name."
"Mona."
"Spencer."
"Alison."
So most of us think that Alison killed her sister.
Okay, now we need to prove she had the motive
and the opportunity to murder Charlotte.
I don't know about a motive, but she had the opportunity.
Oh, I should go. It's late.
Yeah.
Is that Alison? Looks like her car.
I think that's Charlotte.
That night we thought that it was Charlotte
but maybe it was Alison.
How do you know it wasn't Charlotte?
Charlotte wasn't wearing a red jacket that night
and she didn't drive Alison's car home.
Ali loved Charlotte.
I mean, she stayed here to take care of her.
Why would she do that just to kill her
as soon as she got out?
And th-there's no motive.
She's been on her best behavior
since she got back, but we can't pretend
the Alison who blinded Jenna never existed.
Maybe your Goody two-shoes ex became too much
for her to handle.
Maybe she snapped.
Or maybe it was self-defense.
Maybe it was Charlotte who snapped again.
We all know that she was upset
about Alison and Elliot being together.
Maybe Ali had to defend herself.
I don't care why she did it, okay?
I just, I wanna find a way to prove
that she did it so that we can get Hanna back.
Okay, well, if the person who murdered Charlotte
was wearing the red jacket,
it'll have Charlotte's blood on it.
We'll go to her house to look for it.
I'm all over Mary Drake.
I think she's the fastest route to Hanna.
I agree.
So we work together.
She said she was moving into the motel.
All roads lead to the Lost Woods Resort.
Oh, my God, Hanna.
Mona, let me see.
Oh, she looks so scared.
At least she's alive.
You guys, we have to get to her.
But where is she?
We need to find her now.
Here are the keys to Ali's house.
I'm going to Welby. And I'm not leaving without an answer.
Ali has to tell me the truth.
What the hell is in those bags?
Come on, let's go.
Hey, there's no reason for all four of us to tail her.
Look, Caleb's right. Let's head back over to the motel
and find out everything we can about Mary Drake.
Yeah, sure.
Can I borrow your keys?
Yeah.
Here.
Yeah, but you'll need another thing to push down--
Tumbler? Got it.
Oh, you've gotten a lot better at this.
Yeah, I took a tactical lock opening course at the academy.
That's impressive.
It's strange that Alison didn't know
her mother had a twin.
Elliot, almost everything
about the DiLaurentis family is strange.
How do you know that Mary is Charlotte's mom?
CeCe Drake, Mary Drake.
I just put two and two together.
Oh, this is important news.
And I'm glad you confided in me.
But I'm afraid it's not enough to help Alison.
Ali thought she was seeing dead people.
This is clear proof that she wasn't.
Emily, since the last time you saw her
my wife's condition has..
...rapidly declined.
I'm afraid she suffered a complete psychotic break.
I don't understand.
Neither do I.
But she is consumed with shame
I believe, prompted by a tragic event
that-that she feels responsible for.
Do you have any idea what she could've done
that would prompt her to have such a, a lethal dose of guilt?
No!
Doctor, it's a Code White.
No! No! No!
No! No!
Get away from me!
No! No!
No!
Books.
And more books.
These are all written in German.
I think most of these are French textbooks.
Medicine, banking, construction.
Fortgeschrittene Konzepte In Der Chemie.
Advanced concepts in chemistry.
You speak German?
I'm sort of obsessed with this language app
where they reward you with a flag
every time you reach the fluent level.
Then your little emoji boards a plane
and it flies to the country.
Sort of obsessed? How many flags do you have?
Um, French, Italian, German
and this close to flying to China.
The Art Of Cyber War.
Appliquer Principe Et Prouve.
Applied and proven principles.
If Mary Drake is A.D.,
she's a self-taught "Uber A."
And she's been to more countries than your emoji.
Mostly Europe. But she's been to Latin America too.
Oh, hey, look at this.
She flew from Heathrow to Philly a month ago.
That was right before Charlotte died.
About a week.
So she's had plenty of time to become A.D.
Okay.
We're good.
Okay.
Linen closet.
I'll check the dresser.
That's, that's a little weird.
Oh, please don't tell me that you found a toy.
It's already bad enough that I'm going
through Alison's panty drawer. I don't need to--
It's locked.
It's not here.
I can't find a key anywhere.
Did you hear that?
And in a related story,
the prime minister told BNS in an exclusive interview
that we need a proper government inquiry into all of this.
In fact, the last government ended scandals like this
the current government is in...
Uh, I just realized none of us
have had anything to eat since yesterday.
Can I bring you guys something?
Food's the last thing on my mind, Spencer.
Okay, um, well,
then I'm gonna go over the Mary Drake file again.
Maybe there's something--
Alright, great.
Bye to you too.
I've got everything that we need.
Who's she talkin' to?
I can only hear her side of the call.
I need just a few more seconds to..
No. No, no, no, no, no. No, no.
Don't hang up. Don't..
Bleach, charcoal... vinegar.
That's everything you need to cover up a murder.
What's the charcoal for?
Absorbs the smell of death.
Hey, she's still alive.
How can you be so sure?
Because they aren't gonna use that tarp after the fact.
And she's gonna lead us to Hanna.
Yeah, because she's on her way to kill her.
Please stop. Stop!
Please.
Please stop.
No. No. No. Please stop. Please!
Stop!
Stop!
She's been driving around for hours.
She's either taking a tour of the county
or she's completely lost.
Or she knows that we're following her
and she's just jerking us around.
She's turning left.
She's not leading us to Hanna.
She-she's taking us to Alison's house.
Cut the lights.
Wait, she's going to Spencer's.
是玛丽·德雷克
Are you Spencer or Melissa?
Um, I know you must be Jessica's sister.
But have we met?
A long time ago, but you wouldn't remember.
I'm Spencer.
Are your parents home?
No, they're on a cruise.
I'll check back another time.
So you know each other?
We used to have a lot in common.
Would you like to come inside?
I can make us some tea.
Yes. Yes, I would.
Herbal or leaded.
Oh, I've never been one to turn down caffeine.
Elliot's not here.
But the nurse says she's calmed down
and I can see her for a few minutes.
Well, I hope she tells you the truth
because we're running out of time.
I'm allowed to go in now. I'll call you back.
Ali?
Are you awake?
Ali, please wake up.
Hanna's in trouble.
Okay? And I need to know the truth.
The truth about Charlotte.
Did you do it?
Did you..
Did you kill her?
Oh, God, help me.
Oh, please, God, forgive me.
You and your sister look so much alike.
Almost like twins.
Yeah, people thought that a lot when we were younger.
Are you close?
Occasionally.
So when did you see my parents last?
I only asked because they never talked about you.
I know enough about your family
to know that they're excellent secret keepers.
Well, why would they keep you a secret?
You certainly are inquisitive.
I was just making conversation.
I'm sorry. Forgive me if I'm overly sensitive.
The truth is, my sister and I didn't get along.
I moved away because she..
...turned everyone against me.
My friends, my family.
She poisoned them all against me.
Why?
I was born first, and she was born jealous.
Well, may I ask why you've come back?
I mean, why now?
Because I found out she was dead.
Well, I've taken up enough of your time.
Thank you for the tea.
Yeah.
Um, so you're at the Lost Woods all by yourself?
Yes, I'm all alone.
Do you have any children?
Like I said, it's just me.
How would you know that that's where I'm staying?
Oh, it's such a small town.
My ex-boyfriend is a cop
and he told me about your break-in.
You know, you're a very lucky young woman.
I can't seem to be friends with any of my ex-lovers.
C'est la vie.
C'est la vie.
You should lock this door.
These days, you're not safe anywhere.
She looks so scared.
It's been over 36 hours since you got any sleep.
Maybe you should try and rest.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'll get a T-shirt, and I'll set the alarm.
Maybe I should go home.
Are you sure?
No, I mean,
I'm not really sure of anything.
You know, I haven't talked to Liam in days.
You and I, we haven't even talked
about what happened between us.
Was it a slip
or are we friends with benefits?
Are we even a we again?
I guess we have a lot to talk about.
Yeah, I just, I, um, feel like
I need to think about it before I can talk about it.
Okay.
Em, hey.
How did it go with Ali?
Uh, turns out they wouldn't let me in to see her.
Do you still have that key that I gave you?
Ali's?
Uh, yeah.
Are you thinking about going back there?
I'll come with you. Emily.
Um, I'll give you a call if I go.
Yeah, okay.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Again with the lies.
I'm sorry.
That was a joke.
It's just..
...someone that I care very deeply for.
And I'm starting to think that she did a very bad thing.
Now another friend is paying the price for it.
I made some lemon bars this morning.
It'll go really good with that cappuccino.
Come on.
What is she doing?
It's called pacing.
You know, I can actually appreciate your skillset
but do you always have to be such a smart-ass?
Do you always have to be so direct?
I was giving you a compliment.
Calling me names isn't complimentary.
Whatever.
You know, she's in there alone. We can take her.
And then what? We waterboard her?
Look, A.D. said we have 24 hours.
We still have six of those left.
Wait, her phone's ringing.
Oh, come on, Mary, keep talking.
Can you hear the other person?
Don't shush me.
The signal keeps dropping in and out
but it's definitely a man.
I think he has an accent. Maybe Aussie, maybe British.
What is that?
I got a lock on the caller's signal.
It's coming from a bar near Hollis called Snookers.
I'm on it.
Aria, Mary Drake is talking to a British guy
or possibly an Aussie at a bar near Hollis.
It's called Snookers. Do you know it?
Yeah, I used to go there with Ezra.
I was on my way home. I can be there in five minutes.
Be careful.
Hanna.
Oh, Spencer.
You've got this, Hanna.
You're gonna be okay.
I think I'm gonna die in here.
No, I won't let that happen.
But this is a dream.
You can't help me. You're not real, Spence.
Something real is actually existing
as a thing or occurring in fact.
I don't know what you're saying, but I'm glad that you're here.
A dream is an experience
and an experience is real.
Do you understand?
Maybe.
No.
I should've listened to you.
Spence, I think...
...this A is a lot smarter than the others.
You told them the truth, right?
Maybe it's a good thing we don't know who killed Charlotte.
'Cause I'd tell if I did.
I'm scared, Spence.
I know. I know.
There's no way out.
No, look, if A.D. Can come in and out of here
you can, too.
Think about it, Hanna.
If there is a way in, there is a way out, right?
Yeah, I guess so.
Say it.
If there is a way in, there is a way out.
You're gonna need your strength for tomorrow.
Get some sleep.
Will you stay with me?
Always.
*Hush little baby don't say a word*
*Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird*
*And if that mockingbird won't sing*
What can I get you?
Oh, I'm looking for a guy.
Um, no. He's-he's just not any guy.
He's British, maybe.
Can I get you something to drink or not?
Sure. Yeah. I'll take a beer. Thanks.
Thanks.
Hey, don't look away. I'm right here.
Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
Hey, you're doin' alright?
Doin' fine. How are you?
Good, man. Hey, where have you been?
Workin' my tail off like always.
Yeah, I hear you, man.
I don't need to know what we are tonight.
I just need to be with you.
We'll be friends forever.
That's why I love you. You're big on happy endings.
I never told you this, but you were always my favorite.
You'd look so good on top of the Eiffel Tower
wind in your hair.
You were the hardest for me to leave behind.
Ali, are you asleep?
Oh, Ali.
What did you do?
If there's a way in, there's a way out.
Mary Drake was in and out of Radley
for a significant part of her life.
She was initially institutionalized
for an incident involving the death of a child
who was under Mary's care while she was babysitting.
There were no charges ever filed
but she was forced to stay in Radley until she was 18.
And then she was readmitted several times
until she got out for good 23 years ago.
So she was the babysitter from hell?
You guys, that was Mona. Mary just left the Lost Woods.
She needs backup. Now.
Emily, what is this about?
I lied to you earlier, Aria.
I did see Ali
and I'm pretty sure she confessed to killing Charlotte.
Did you record it?
No, it all happened so fast and..
...I wasn't expecting her to say that she did it.
I was the holdout earlier.
I didn't write down Ali's name
because I didn't wanna believe that it was her.
Look, this is all great, Emily, but the clock is ticking
and it doesn't help us. We still can't prove it.
When I was staying with Ali, she told me she was packing up
some stuff to give to Goodwill.
I didn't know it would be in there.
I just had a hunch.
Before we hand it over to A.D.
can we please go over this one more time?
I love Hanna just as much as you all do.
But we're about to hand over one of our own for another.
But it's different, Em.
Hanna is innocent, Ali is not.
Look, we know that Ali is a master manipulator
but I don't believe that she's a cold-blooded killer.
Whatever happened that night, I believe
that she was protecting herself, but she still killed Charlotte.
We don't have time to debate this.
Right now, Alison is safely locked up at Welby
and Hanna's life is on the line.
We need to get that jacket to A.D.
Caleb?
He's gone.
How does he know where to go?
He took my phone.
Where are you?
We lost Mary.
It doesn't matter. I have what I need to get Hanna back.
Help!
Help! Please! Help me!
Help! Help! Please, stop!
Stop, please.
Have you heard anything?
Not yet. Radio silence.
One of us should go to Welby to check on Ali.
We did the right thing. She's in a safe place.
Yeah, Welby is locked up like Fort Knox, Em.
I know. You're right.
How are you feeling?
Maybe a little crazy?
Don't worry.
I am going to take care of you.
I'm gonna make sure you live a long life..
...rotting away in here.
I know you killed Charlotte.
Just like you, Alison
Karma can be such a bitch.
