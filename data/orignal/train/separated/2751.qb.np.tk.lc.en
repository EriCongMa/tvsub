&apos;we should do this again ! &apos;
what ? he said &apos; we should do it again &apos; , that &apos;s good , right ?
uh , no . loosely translated &apos; we should do this again&apos;
means &apos; you will never see me naked &apos; .
since when ?
since always . it &apos;s like dating language .
y &apos;know , like &apos; it &apos;s not you &apos; means &apos; it is you &apos; .
or &apos; you &apos;re such a nice guy &apos; means
&apos;i &apos;m gonna be dating leather @-@ wearing alcoholics
and complaining about them to you
or , or , y &apos;know , um , &apos; i think we should see other people &apos; means
&apos;ha , ha , i already am &apos; .
and everybody knows this ?
yeah . cushions the blow .
yeah , it &apos;s like when you &apos;re a kid ,
and your parents put your dog to sleep ,
and they tell you it went off to live on some farm .
that &apos;s funny , that , no , because ,
uh , our parents actually did , uh ,
send our dog off to live on a farm .
uh , ross .
what ? wh- hello ? the millners &apos; farm in connecticut ?
the millners ,
they had this unbelievable farm ,
and horses , and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....
oh , my god , chi chi !
&quot; so how does it feel knowing you &apos;re about to die ? &quot;
&quot; warden , in five minutes my pain will be over .
but you &apos;ll have to live with the knowledge that
you sent an honest man to die . &quot;
hey , that was really good !
yeah ? thanks ! let &apos;s keep going .
okay . &quot; so . whaddya want from me , damone , huh ? &quot;
&quot; i just wanna go back to my cell .
&apos;cause in my cell , i can smoke . &quot;
&quot; smoke away . &quot;
i think this is probably why damone smokes in his cell alone .
what ?
relax your hand ! let your wrist go .
not so much !
alright , now try taking a puff .
okay .
okay . no . give it to me .
no no no , i am not giving you a cigarette .
it &apos;s fine , it &apos;s fine .
look , do you wanna get this part , or not ? here .
all right , now .
don &apos;t think of it as a cigarette .
think of it as the thing that &apos;s been missing from your hand .
when you &apos;re holding it , you feel right . you feel complete .
y &apos;miss it ?
nah , not so much .
alright , now we smoke .
oh .. my .. god .
chandler , give me that !
no , no , no .
you &apos;ve got options .

chandler , give me the cigarette ! give me , give me .
all right you try .
thank you .
okay , how &apos;s this ?
okay , that &apos;s not bad .
all right , when you &apos;re finished , it &apos;s cool if you flick it .
you flick it , flick it , flick it .
that &apos;s good .
all right , you keep practicing .. and
and i &apos;ll go put out the sofa .
i thought it was foot size .
no , no , no . they say it &apos;s the same as the distance
from the tip of a guy &apos;s thumb to the tip of his index finger .
that &apos;s ridiculous !
can i use .. either thumb ?
i &apos;d rather go with the foot theory .
alright , don &apos;t tell me , don &apos;t tell me !
decaf cappucino for joey ..
coffee black ..
late ..
and an iced tea .
i &apos;m getting pretty good at this !
yeah . yeah , excellent .

and there &apos;s five hundred extra dollars in my account .
oh , satan &apos;s minions at work again ...
yes , &apos; cause now i have to go down there , and deal with them .
what are you talking about ? keep it !
it &apos;s not mine , i didn &apos;t earn it ,
if i kept it , it would be like stealing .
yeah , but if you spent it , it would be like shopping !
okay . okay , let &apos;s say i bought a really great pair of shoes .
do you know what i &apos;d hear , with every step i took ?
&apos;not @-@ mine . not @-@ mine . not @-@ mine.&apos;
and even if i was happy , okay , and , and skipping @-@ i &apos;d hear
&apos;not @-@ not @-@ mine , not @-@ not @-@ mine , not @-@ not @-@ mine , not @-@ not @-@ mine &apos; ...
we &apos;re with you . we got it .
okay . i &apos;d- just- i &apos;d never be able to enjoy it .
it would be like this giant karmic debt .
chandler , what &apos;re you doing ?
hey , what are you doing ?
oh ! oh , god !

come on now , they &apos;re your friends ,
they &apos;re just looking out after you .

i just wish that once , i &apos;d bring a guy home
that they actually liked .

if they never get to meet the guy .
