I never stopped loving you.
Aria, they're gonna market the hell out of this book.
It's gonna be huge.
Oh, my God, we did it.
I lied to you earlier, Aria. I did see Ali.
And I'm pretty sure she confessed to killing Charlotte.
We don't have time to debate this.
Right now, Alison is safely locked up at Welby
and Hanna's life is on the line.
I'm gonna make sure you live a long life
rotting away in here.
I know you killed Charlotte.
Stop! Please, you have to help me, please.
Are you sure about this?
Yes, I'm sure.
If someone tried to hurt you, the police...
I have to talk to my friends before I do anything.
I understand.
You're a friend of my niece, of Alison.
I never said anything about Alison.
I can tell by the way that you're looking at me.
You knew my sister Jessica, Alison's mother
so you must be a friend of Alison's.
Ali never mentioned anything about her mother having a sister.
Let alone a twin sister?
What's your name?
Hanna.
Families are very complicated things, Hanna.
Yeah, I've noticed.
Many families have secrets.
Most families, really.
And sometimes, those secrets are actual people.
Imagine that.
And that's who you are?
One of those secret people?
Not anymore.
第七季第二集
Here, Hanna.
Hanna, are you sure you don't want to go to the doctor?
I'm sure.
Hanna, I think you should.
The doctors are gonna ask questions.
And then, I'll have to lie. No doctors, no questions.
Hanna, I'm sorry, but you have to tell us
about Mary Drake picking you up.
Is she real?
I mean, is she really who she says she is?
We think so.
Yeah, she was a patient at Radley.
We found her file.
What?
She's Alison's aunt, Charlotte's biological mother.
The DiLaurentis family adopted Charlotte.
So it's her.
Mary Drake, she's been after us all along.
Someone killed her daughter
and then she shows up to get even.
Yeah, we're pretty sure she didn't show up
just to get into the resort business.
She must have been chasing me when I got out.
But why wouldn't she just run me over
instead of bringing me here?
Because we gave her exactly what she wanted.
Charlotte's killer?
We're convinced it's Alison.
We found evidence.
Spencer, can I have something stronger than coffee in here?
Yeah.
This belongs to you.
Thanks.
Oh, that's Mona.
Well, be careful in case it isn't.
马上到那里
Well, there was nobody there, just this.
"Couldn't have done it without you.
Glad we're on the same team. A.D."
It's from Lucas.
Sit down. I can do that.
I can boil my own water. Thanks.
Can I, uh, borrow you for a minute?
So are you gonna take Lucas up on his offer?
He's crazy.
He sees your potential.
Potential for what?
For what you could do if you were in charge.
Caleb, haven't you noticed?
None of us are in charge of anything around here.
Well, we can fix that.
No one's giving up on anybody.
Then what?
Suppose we get through that...
... where does that leave us?
Back to where we started?
Well, I guess it depends on how far back we wanna go.
Look, in that room at the resort
before all the lights went off
and someone pushed me down a hole, I was scared.
Me too.
But you were there.
I always felt safe around you.
Even when we weren't getting along, you made me feel safe.
Maybe that's why what happened happened...
... with us.
So you think we just went back
to what we used to be for a minute?
Yeah.
Only for a minute.
Where is Spencer?
Hey, you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Uh, I just wanted to be by myself for a minute.
I think we're all feeling a little lost right now.
I'm fine.
Do you think Ali's safe?
At Welby?
I mean, places like that are designed to keep people
from getting out, not from getting in.
Maybe we need to warn Elliott.
Well, what do you wanna tell him?
That we told someone his wife
killed her own sister who's actually her cousin?
I mean, he'd lock us up.
Spencer.
Hey, how about I take you home?
Yeah.
Okay.
Em, keep an eye on Hanna.
You feel it too?
Yeah, she's got that look.
The dollhouse look.
Bye.
Do you wanna give Jordan a call?
And tell him what?
That I got myself a little kidnapped for a while?
Maybe you just wanna hear his voice.
It's too late to call him now. I'll do it later.
Hey, aren't you tired?
Um, no, I shot past tired a long time ago.
Well, we should probably get some sleep while we can.
Yeah, I just have to finish this up for my mom.
Turns out there's way more paperwork
when you win instead of lose.
I'm really glad that Hanna's safe.
We all are.
That was so dangerous. I should've stopped her.
You know, Hanna's like an aircraft carrier.
Lot of firepower, but pretty difficult to maneuver.
Yeah, well, I guess they call ships "She" For a reason, huh?
Come to bed.
I will soon.
Hello.
Hello?
Help me.
Who is this?
Help me, Emily.
Ali?
Em, I need you.
Ali, are you alright?
Let go.
Hello.
Give me the phone.
No. No.
Ali?
No, you made a mistake. I visited her the other day.
I'm the one that brought her here.
Mrs. Rollins' visiting instructions have been changed.
Family only.
W-why did they change?
Did something happen?
All I can tell you is the only visitors
she's allowed are family members.
Is Dr. Rollins here? Can you page him, please?
Dr. Rollins is right over there.
Elliott.
Emily.
Thank you.
They won't let me in to see Ali.
Those are my instructions.
Is she alright? Has something happened?
I've decided Alison will be better off
in isolation right now.
Okay, can I just see her for a minute?
It's not in Ali's best interests or yours.
So, when can she have visitors?
As soon as I think she can, I'll call you.
I have to go. I'm sorry.
Thanks.
So how is Alison doing?
I heard she was in the hospital.
I wish people would just leave her alone.
I was just asking how she's doing.
Sorry.
So how are you?
I'm kinda tired.
Did you get the package that I sent over?
Lucas, why are you doing this for me?
I mean, you could be out
building some private spaceship or something.
The private spaceship market
is a little overcrowded at the moment.
Did you look at the papers?
There were a lot of them.
Lot of those little "sign here" stickers.
Why do you make it so hard for somebody
to do something nice for you?
Why do you resist it so much?
Look, Lucas, I think you think I'm somebody I'm not.
Everyone thinks I'm somebody I'm not.
Somebody smarter...
... braver, sharper.
But I'm not.
Yes, you are. That's the point.
Hanna, I think you want this.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have offered it.
But I do need an answer.
We need to file a business plan
or we're gonna lose the tax credit.
Look, I'm just saying, I'm not the best person
when it comes to making decisions.
Well, Hanna, not making a decision...
... that's a decision.
If you could've heard her on the phone.
Maybe she killed Charlotte, maybe she didn't.
We can't just leave her in there with no one protecting her.
Okay, well, did you tell Elliott about the call?
No, I didn't want him to know who she was calling.
So, where did you leave things with him?
He said he'll call me when she improves.
But I don't think we can wait.
Um, it's my work. I'll call them back.
What about Mary Drake?
What about her?
She's family, she has access, you know?
Should we try and use her?
Ask Mary to take us to see Ali?
Em, we think this woman might be Uber A.
You wanna ask her to help?
Okay.
Maybe it's better that we go in there with her
than let her go in by herself.
No, we can't take that chance.
I think we both saw this coming.
Apparently, one of us saw it before the other.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, so am I.
It's just coming home and seeing my friends
and everything that Ali's going through
I realize I've got a lot of unresolved things in my life
and it wouldn't be fair to you.
I think you want me to say "Thank you"
but I'm not going to.
No, I just want you to understand.
I've gotta work through these things.
It doesn't have anything to do with the book or Ezra.
It's all me.
It's just about you and me.
Yeah.
I'm sorry... I don't think you have to say that anymore.
I'm...
I got a surprise too.
It's not as big as yours, but, um...
I'm back on the book.
That's what I came here to tell you.
You're back on the book?
Yeah.
I convinced Jillian that I'd be able to prep
the manuscript faster than anyone else, and she agreed.
You're gonna edit the book?
More that I'll be a kind of creative gatekeeper.
Make sure everything goes well
and everybody stays reasonably happy.
Do we have a problem?
I don't know. Do we?
You worked hard for this.
I'd like to see you get something you've always wanted.
We're almost there, aren't we?
Yeah, almost.
Then we'll do it.
We'll make it work.
Hey, at least we can cross the finish line together.
Not just first class.
First class, front row, window, the side with the door.
Because she has to be the last one on the plane
and the first one off.
No, don't say you'll try, just do it.
I need my napkin.
Under your drink, that's my napkin.
Oh, yeah, sure.
God, don't tear it.
Sorry.
What's wrong?
You just melted a really important phone number.
That's what's wrong.
You and your sweaty glass.
Yeah.
It's okay.
See, the ink ran, but you can see
where the pen pressed into the napkin.
See? There.
Thank you.
Sorry about my sweaty glass.
It's okay.
So what do they charge you for office space around here?
I'm a really good tipper.
Long day at the office? Can I get you something to eat?
Suppose I'm meeting someone?
You're not.
How do you know that?
Well, you ordered a second drink.
If you were meeting someone
you would've nursed your first drink.
Have you been counting my drinks?
I notice details.
Interesting how your sweaty glass
just happened to land on my phone number, isn't it?
Well, that is the most interesting thing
that's happened to me all night.
We just wanna see her.
All we need is five minutes.
If you really wanna help
you'll give Alison time and space to heal.
That's what she needs
and that's what I'm going to make sure she gets.
I'm sorry if you can't understand that.
I know you're her friends
but I am her husband and her doctor.
Maybe that's not the best combination.
Meaning what?
Meaning maybe we're not the only ones
who need a little objectivity.
Well, maybe I'm not the most objective person.
Perhaps that's because I've spent the best part
of five years taking care of Ali and Charlotte.
I lack the clarity you have, being gone so long.
Alright, this isn't about who cares about Alison the most.
We all wanna see her get better.
That's what I'm trying to do.
And, yes, I have consulted other doctors
and I've spoken to Jason.
You have?
Yes.
He approves of her treatment.
What about Mary Drake?
I won't let Mary Drake visit.
I'm concerned about Ali's reaction
to someone who looks so much like her mother.
But that's Ali's aunt...
I'm going to do what's best.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
Is that the kind of diplomacy you learned in Washington?
I'm sorry, Aria,
I have a very low tolerance for condescension.
Eyes on the prize, Spencer.
We want something from him.
Yeah, and I don't think we're going to get it.
Which means that Alison stays on one side of the wall
and we're on the other side.
"She's mine now. No take backs.
No do-overs. A.D."
She's mine now?
Does that mean that A.D. is already in Welby?
What's the meaning of this?
It's a hostile takeover.
Of what?
Of you.
What makes you think it has to be hostile?
Well, I haven't exactly been the model fiancee lately
so I thought I'll put a little more effort into it.
You know, that's not supposed to be a job.
I think the idea is you're supposed to have fun.
I remember fun.
Do you?
Faintly.
You know, sometimes you turn into the most serious person
I've ever known.
Okay, I didn't come here to be insulted.
Not all the time. Just lately.
Since you've been spending time in Rosewood.
Yeah, well, it can have that effect on you.
Then why do you keep going back there?
Do you know what I wanna do?
What do you wanna do?
Do you remember that bar off Columbus where we first met?
Yes, I do.
Well, I wanna go back there
and buy you a drink.
And I wanna go back there and flirt with you
and start all over again.
Is that something that might interest you?
Elliott's not gonna help us. We have to do something.
Okay, something does not include making a deal with the devil.
Besides, you heard him, Mary cannot get in there
anymore than we can.
Okay, but what if we did it together?
If we used Mary Drake to get us in.
No, Emily, it's not happening.
Hey, look, I'm not saying that we let her in the club.
I'm not even saying that we should trust her.
But we need a way to Ali and right now
Mary Drake is the closest thing to a key that we've got.
We don't know anything about her.
You know more about her than anybody else.
You were in there, Spencer.
In Radley, before the designer cocktails and the valet parking.
You were locked in there.
You know how that feels.
And you know what that can do to a person.
Rollins talked to Jason?
That's what he said.
According to Toby, that's something
that nobody else has managed to do.
Are the police looking for Jason?
Toby is.
He needs someone to confirm Mary Drake's story.
Confirmation other than her face?
People don't seem to remember Ali's mother having a sister.
When do you meet with Liam?
4 o'clock.
Can we make this work with him?
Of course, we can make it work. I think.
At least long enough to finish the book.
I was in such a rush to get it over with
that I broke up with him before he told me
that he was back on the book.
I really complicated the situation.
All due respect, things have been complicated
for quite some time.
This book means as much to Liam as it does to us
and that's why he wants to work on it.
Yeah, it might mean as much to him
but it does not mean the same things.
I promise I will make this work.
And there's a problem with his backstory.
I just noticed it this last time through.
What-what sort of problem?
The predatory nature of his actions.
You think he comes across as predatory?
I understand the impulse, the Lolita myth.
Not the Nabokov original but the whole older man
小说《洛丽塔》的作者
inappropriately young girl idea
that's been trashed by lesser writers.
Well, we can't all be Nabokov.
Some of us can't even manage Nicholas Sparks.
Well, at least Sparks understands what a reader
can tolerate and what makes their skin crawl.
Are we looking at the same pages here?
Because they aren't that far apart in age
so I'm having a little trouble seeing what you're seeing here.
That's because he's your hero.
You're invested in justifying his actions.
You're too close to see him as he really is.
Listen, I'm just being frank here.
If-if I can't be frank, I can't help you.
We all want the best book.
Exactly.
And right now, there's this friction
between your chapters and Aria's.
Friction?
Look,
neither one of us want Aria to look foolish, right?
Like she let herself get talked into something
that she didn't want.
You mean Aria's character.
Yeah, her character.
I'm here to protect this book.
And that means protecting the authors. Both of them.
Protecting from what?
A loss of perspective. Poor judgment.
Avoidable bad choices.
That's a big responsibility.
And I take it very seriously.
Yes.
I can see that.
I-I just, I understand that I have commitments
but I have commitments here too.
Yes, and you agreed.
I will get a hard date as soon as I can.
Thank you. Bye.
Hello, Spencer.
Miss Drake.
I saw you in here, and I thought I'd ask about your friend.
About Hanna. How is she?
Uh, she's, she's alright.
Has she told you any more about what happened to her?
No. No, not much.
I have to tell you, I don't feel
especially good about the other night.
What about it?
Letting Hanna talk me into taking her to your house
instead of the police or the hospital.
So why did you?
She insisted.
Yes but you were the one who was driving the car.
You could have taken her to the police.
You could have taken her to the doctor.
You could have taken her anywhere,
but you didn't. Why?
Frankly, Spencer, my experiences with hospitals
and the police haven't always been the best.
I'm sorry, what do you mean?
I told you that my sister and I had issues.
That's true, but not really honest.
One of the most distressing things about Alison
being where she is right now is that
I have had similar experiences.
I spent time, considerable time
in Radley when it was a sanitarium.
May I ask you why?
Why you were at Radley?
I'm gonna tell you this because I want you to understand
why I'm so worried about Alison.
We were 14, my sister and I. Jessica was babysitting.
She called me to complain that the baby wouldn't stop crying.
It was the Carver baby, Teddy.
He was ten months old, and he had a cold
and he must have been miserable.
She begged me to come and help her.
I didn't want to go, but I did.
And when I got there, the baby was upstairs finally asleep.
Jessica said she had given him a bath
and he had fallen right off.
Then she asked me to stay with Teddy
so she could meet up with Matt Brooks.
Jessica left.
And when the Carvers came home, I told them that
Jessica had called me because she had a headache.
Mrs. Carver went upstairs.
Mr. Carver was giving me Jessica's money.
Mrs. Carver started to scream.
She screamed like she was on fire.
Teddy was dead.
When they found Jessica, she said
well, the baby had been fine when she left.
But you told them...
They believed Jessica.
Everybody always believed Jessica.
She was the warm one.
And that was why your parents put you in Radley.
It was that or prison.
They thought I'd be safer.
At least that's what they told me.
Are you sure?
Liam can be really passionate about writing.
What I got wasn't criticism. It was anger.
Anger at what?
At me.
And I promised to keep my side clean
but if every note session is gonna be a ten-round bout
I-I don't know what's gonna be left of this book
or of any of us.
I don't understand.
Aria, what does Liam
really know about you and me?
Well, this is the address.
I'm afraid it's gone.
No, it can't be gone.
Oh, we haven't been here in a long time.
No, it cannot be gone.
I mean, they-they can't just take it away like that.
You can't just pull out a building
like it was a bad tooth or something.
It's New York City, Hanna.
They tear things down as quickly as they put them up.
Well, this was important.
Okay, I needed this to be here right where I left it.
I was counting on it.
I mean, Jordan, this is where we first met.
And now we don't have a beginning anymore
because they tore it down.
Who do you people think you are?
What's wrong?
Tell me and I'll fix it.
I was gonna make it perfect this time.
You know, everybody gets what they want.
God, I had it all figured out and now it's ruined.
It's gone, and it'll never work now.
W-we'll just go someplace else.
They'll just tear that down too. Don't you get it?
I'm a one-woman Demolition Derby.
Okay, I can't do this to you.
What do you want?
Hanna, I would move Heaven and Earth for you?
You know that, don't you?
Yes... I do
and I am so sorry.
Hanna, come on. This can't be it.
Miss Drake?
Emily Fields.
I was at Spencer's when you dropped off Hanna.
Emily. Yes.
Are you staying here now?
No, I was just...
... thinking about this place today
and wondering what it looked like now.
Do you wanna sit down?
Yes, I think I would.
I saw they kept the big gates out in front.
Yeah, they did.
At night, boys from town used to rattle sticks on the bars.
Somebody would dare them to go to the nut house after midnight.
I thought it was pretty frightening during the day.
It was.
But sometimes you find tenderness
in the last place you'd expect.
And that's really all any of us needs to survive
is a little tenderness at the right moment.
I went to visit Ali this morning.
How is she?
They wouldn't let me in to see her.
Who wouldn't let you in?
Elliot or Dr. Rollins.
He doesn't want me to see her either.
But you-you've been talking to him about her, right?
Over the phone. Once.
Are you satisfied with how he's been taking care of her?
Oh, yes.
I suppose.
Overall. I mean, he's very professional.
Yeah.
But it does take some getting used to him
being her new husband and her doctor.
I'm the one that took Ali to Welby
and I can't help but wonder if I did the right thing.
You wanted to help.
Yeah, but I don't know if I did.
You're Ali's aunt.
Maybe if you talk to somebody at the sanitarium...
I don't know, Emily.
That would be like challenging Dr. Rollins.
Yeah, I understand.
Perhaps you and I can go to the sanitarium together.
Look, I feel bad about how we left things today.
If we don't work on this project together, it'll be another one.
Can I borrow your pen?
My pen?
To sign these papers, partner.
You're right. I want this.
And right now, I want this more than anything else.
You said that we could work together.
That we could all be adults.
I meant it when I said it.
Then what happened?
I don't know.
Reading his pages again and then sitting there
listening to him while he was talking...
He has a way with words.
I used to admire that.
You don't anymore?
No, now I am suspicious.
Of what?
It was a lot of unconnected things
that I didn't wanna connect and then they clicked
together on their own.
Your history, what you've been writing
how you've been writing it.
What changes in a room when you guys are alone together
and then somebody else walks in?
Okay, and what do all these connections mean?
I think you were seduced by your English teacher
when you were in high school.
It's not how it happened.
I just gave you a great opening to lie one more time
and you didn't take it.
Look, there is no way that I can possibly explain this to you.
Then try by telling me how you'd explain it to yourself.
Okay, I used to think what if there was a button
that I could push and all of the things
that have complicated my life would just unhappen?
I would push it, and all of the people
that shouldn't have died would still be alive.
I wouldn't have hurt anyone or disappointed them
and no one would have hurt me or lied to me
and this whole mess would just be cleaned up.
But if I push that button, I would be gone too.
I am me because of what has happened
what I've done and because of who I love.
I like that person.
That me.
Mess and all.
Emily?
You were supposed to wake me up.
It took me longer to get here than I thought it would.
I can't move.
I think something's wrong with me.
You're in the hospital.
We're gonna miss our flight.
We'll take the next one.
Ali, you called me last night.
Did I?
Yeah.
And you sounded scared.
Like you wanted help.
This is a scary place.
There's this lady that cries all night.
Am I in Radley?
No. No.
Well, that's good.
I was worried for a minute.
Mommy?
Why did you leave me?
I woke up, and there was dirt all over me
and you wouldn't help.
Why did you leave me in the ground?
It's so cold.
Alison.
You were wrong about Elliot.
He's not like what you said at all.
What about Elliot?
I didn't authorize this.
Uh, this lady is a relative...
No visitors without my permission.
Out. Everyone. Right now.
Emily, no, don't go.
Emily, no!
No!
No!
What happened to her?
She wasn't like that when she came here.
Miss Drake, I'd like a word with you.
No one's to come in.
You're not supposed to be here.
I've been calling you for two days.
Your being here is not part of the plan.
Well, neither is what you're doing to that girl.
You've gone too far.
You got what you wanted.
The money is yours.
Not yet it isn't.
Then stop wasting my time.
Listen to me.
Don't.
Hello.
Hey.
Dad's private stock.
Mm-hmm.
Yes, it is.
What's the occasion?
I got fired.
What?
By text.
"You have abused the generosity of this organization
and chosen to pursue partisan interests
over the greater good."
Well, they're wrong.
No, they're not.
I have been rather "Distracted" lately.
I'm so sorry.
Thanks.
What are you gonna do now?
I don't know, um...
Stay with my mom's transition team.
Maybe go with her to Harrisburg...
... if I can.
And what would be stopping you?
This town has its own particular gravity.
We both know that.
How's Hanna?
I haven't talked to her.
Emily said she got a text that she was going to New York.
I guess she wanted to see Jordan.
I am afraid to ask you this, but I really have to.
Did we make a mistake?
You and I?
No.
No, we didn't.
Whatever we did, it wasn't a mistake.
It-it was real.
So why are you talking about it in the past tense?
