第三季 第十四集
&quot; between two groups of people
who want to make inconsistent kinds of worlds ,
i see no remedy but force . &quot;
oliver wendell holmes .
there was a point where all i saw were feathers .
then i started swinging .
and then i hit something and heard someone fall .
could &apos;ve been somebody from my side .
in 2012 , greendale community college
was the site of the largest and longest pillow fight
in community college history .
it shaped and scarred the landscape of their campus
and forever changed the lives of those involved .
a health care administration student ,
who turned the storage room into a sanctuary for soldiers
with broken glasses and lightly grazed testicles .
a high school dropout and amateur photographer
whose borrowed camera would capture
some of the war &apos;s blurriest , most poorly framed moments .
a disgraced former lawyer
whose words would inspire tens of students
to take up pillows and fight ,
most likely to avoid an upcoming test .
a loving wife and mother who would prove to be
as skilled at kicking asses as she was at wiping them .
the dried @-@ up heir to a moist towelette empire ,
who would prove to be the dried @-@ up heir
to a moist towelette empire .
the sensitive high school quarterback
who became commander in chief of his own army .
he would later say of the war , &quot; it was awesome ,
but also , it wasn &apos;t . &quot;
and his socially dysfunctional best friend
turned bitter rival ,
an uncompromising tactical mastermind feared by all
yet unable to pay parking tickets
or know left from right
without mouthing the pledge of allegiance .
the rift in their friendship would carry their school
into a conflict lasting days ,
costing hundreds of dollars
and resulting in over 12 transfers .
there are people who say , &quot; i don &apos;t get it .
so it was a pillow fight , &quot;
to which i say ...
&quot; you weren &apos;t there . &quot;
jeffrey , you have to come mediate troy and abed .
they look up to you .
what &apos;s with the film crew ?
don &apos;t worry about that .
oh , i am worried about that .
if there &apos;s one thing i &apos;ve learned at this place ,
it &apos;s that a film crew means disaster .
okay , they are here to document
greendale &apos;s guinness record ,
which you are going to make sure we get
by talking to troy and abed right now .
this is your fault .
no , it &apos;s your fault .
this is your fault .
your fault .
your fault !
your fault !
okay , i &apos;ve got good news for both of you .
neither of you has to apologize because what you &apos;re doing
is equally ridiculous .
so here &apos;s the solution i &apos;m pitching .
i &apos;m giving you two imaginary friendship hats
that automatically make you friends again .
are we done ?
sorry , jeff , but this matter &apos;s a little more serious than that .
no , it &apos;s not .
you &apos;re children acting like grown @-@ ups .
i mean , it &apos;s fine .
but just don &apos;t pretend it &apos;s anything but that .
troy barnes and abed nadir .
friends so close , they once graced the cover
of friends weekly , a pretend magazine of their own design .
earlier that day , they begin construction
on a fort made of pillows .
its name-- new fluffytown .
its goal-- to be a newer , fluffier town than fluffytown ,
their blanket fort from the previous year .
new fluffytown don &apos;t care who you were .
you were surrounded by softness .
it &apos;s just like crawling through a hug .
well ...
i guess all hugs have to come to an end .
when an opportunity arises for a world record ,
it creates a rift .
troy wants to go for the record
using blankets for rapid expansion .
abed insists on pillows ,
declaring world records to be dumb .
troy declares the declaration lame ,
stating that thinking records are dumb is stupid .
he secedes from new fluffytown
and begins constructing blanketsburg
on the other side of the campus .
abed renames his fort pillowtown
for the sake of conceptual symmetry .
both forts expand until both are in each other &apos;s way .
study room &quot; f , &quot; 3 : 00 p.m. ,
things quickly reach their boiling point .
you stand back .
watch it , star @-@ burns .
my name is alex !
a softly lobbed , hypoallergenic sealy select
in a floral print case
collides with a load @-@ bearing broomstick ,
collapsing a queen @-@ sized section of blanket fort .
you saw that . they knocked it down !
stop , let &apos;s go !
jeffery ! jeffery , find me !
get back !
jeffery !
it was later named &quot; the study room kerfuffle . &quot;
protect everyone !
protect pillowtown !
jeffrey , you &apos;re not mediating .
ah , dean , what do you want me to say , huh ?
i mean , some conflicts are so pointless ,
they just have to play themselves out .
fine .
the legit republic of blanketsburg
says pillowtown has until midnight tonight
to surrender its territory .
the united forts of pillowtown declines the request .
it &apos;s not a request .
i &apos;m giving you an &quot; all tomato , &quot;
meaning that you give me the whole tomato or else .
or else what ?
see you at midnight .
oh , my god .
do people go to classes ?
the deadline divides friendships ,
families , even study groups .
pierce hawthorne takes troy &apos;s side ,
citing that abed is weirder and more foreign .
shirley bennett decides her allegiance
in a text message to her husband .
i &apos;ll be home late , sugar boots .
abed hurt troy &apos;s feelings by being a robot .
need to stay with my boy to make sure
britta doesn &apos;t put him on the weed .
please record forensic files .
troy appoints shirley bennett
as his second @-@ in @-@ command , at which point ,
pierce switches to abed &apos;s side .
there were those who thought that midnight might come and go ,
and nothing would happen .
well , i was in korea , and i knew the sound of crap
when it was about to hit the fan .
you know what it sounded like ?
that &apos;s right , jackson .
silence .
midnight comes , and a campus holds its breath .
i know there &apos;s a lot of blanket stackers and pillow packers out there
thinking it &apos;s going to go down tonight .
but there &apos;s a lot of us folks from the scene in between
saying , &quot; hey , we &apos;re all looking to chill out
and lay down with someone special . &quot;
this is real neil with pipes of steel ,
signing off with the smooth sounds
of daybreak .
i gotta get this on film .
i am straight trouncing spaz in go fish .
dude , what are you doing ?
don &apos;t record this .
come on !
wait , did you hear that ?
what the hell is that ?
12 : 07 a.m.
blanketsburg soldiers charge a pillow fort in the library .
the pillowtonians move quickly to defend .
there were no rules in that first battle .
you hit someone , and if they went down ,
you stop hitting them .
call that common courtesy .
then what if they get up ?
do you maybe keep hitting them till they learn to stay down ?
we call that common sense .
the battle lasts six minutes .
no territory changes hands .
blanketsburg has drawn first blood .
pillowtown will draw first blood part ii .
citizens of blanketsburg , i ask you now
to prepare for war .
and i ask garrett to please fix the microphone on my laptop .
it &apos;s doing that thing again .
the united forts of pillowtown
and the legit republic of blanketsburg
are at war ,
each side attempting to kick down and replace the other .
the unmoving line between them
is a campus @-@ wide , fleece @-@ laden strip
of pillow @-@ to @-@ pillow combat .
britta perry attempts to capture
the war &apos;s sublime indignities on film .
unfortunately for britta
and millions of photographers like her ,
just because something is in black and white
doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s good .
rules are agreed upon , but casualties are inevitable .
outside the science lab ,
at the battle of big bulletin board ,
pierce hawthorne suffers broken glasses ,
a hurt finger , and erectile dysfunction ,
which , in his words , had never happened ever before that battle .
pillows , but no sleep .
feathers , but no birds .
pajamas without children .
violence without purpose .
i saw mommy kissing exxon mobil .
amanda johnson .
poet by choice , lesbian by birth .
even jeff winger , who , before the war ,
lacked interest in it , has now found a leading role .
soldiers of blanketsburg ,
we fight not because we want war .
we fight ,
that we might gain peace !
winger &apos;s critics suggest
he merely improvised hot @-@ button patriotic dogma
in a ferris buellerian attempt to delay schoolwork .
winger decries the accusation as ,
&quot; a slanderous betrayal akin to 9 / 11 . &quot;
later after the war ,
he would refer to the theory as &quot; essentially accurate . &quot;
annie edison provides humanitarian relief for both sides .
her text conversations with jeff winger give us a glimpse
beneath the cushions of war to the lost pennies
and grody q @-@ tips of war &apos;s emotional toll .
jeff , heard from one of troy &apos;s soldiers about a speech
you gave to troops at the blanket fort .
wish this war could be over .
but proud of you for taking a stance .
text message .
annie edison .
thank you , annie .
i &apos;m proud of you too and of us all .
also with the nightmare would end .
but using what i &apos;m given to give what i can .
jeff winger .
jeff , just heard from one of abed &apos;s soldiers
that you gave an identical speech to troops at pillowtown .
wtf ? sad face .
special icon of a downward thumb .
annie , okay , you caught me .
i prefer war to homework .
how do you do that little thumb icon ?
i can &apos;t find it on my phone .
jeff winger .
jeff , you &apos;re disgusting .
troy and abed &apos;s friendship is at stake .
you can buy special icons and packages at the app store .
piece of sushi , birthday cake , stop sign , snowman , umbrella .
annie edison .
pierce hawthorne , humiliated
in the battle of big bulletin board ,
wants a chance to redeem himself .
i &apos;m working on something . look at this .
you can build this ?
you just give me the pillows .
i hope to god we &apos;ll never have to use it .
oh , me too .
rumors of hawthorne &apos;s weapon find their way to troy .
troy barnes will take no chances .
he turns to ben chang , greendale &apos;s chief of security ,
rumored to be literally psychotic ,
and who has been kept on the sidelines until this moment .
chang has recruited an army of preteen security interns
while moonlighting at a local bar mitzvah .
they were later nicknamed &quot; the changlorious basterds , &quot;
like inglourious basterds ,
but with &quot; chang &quot; instead of &quot; in . &quot;
i don &apos;t get it either .
most of the soldiers in this war
hadn &apos;t fought with a pillow in years .
these little bastards ,
pillow fighting was a way of life for them .
杀掉法西斯后割掉他们的头皮做纪念
one of the interns said they were making necklaces out of mattress tags .
this is when things get as ugly as they can get ...
战场天使
while still being a pillow fight .
crazy war , huh ?
i heard chang &apos;s kids are really ducking stuff up .
hey , check it out . i downloaded that thing .
birthday cake , birthday cake , unicorn , woman &apos;s shoe .
how &apos;s the nurse thing going ?
no response .
you guys like pillows ?
how do you like these pillows ?
the changlorious basterds have turned the war
into a chaotic sea of high @-@ thread @-@ count terror .
under advice from his top general ,
abed sees no choice but to unleash his doomsday device .
you &apos;re going to die , you little bastards !
what the heck is that ?
he is part man , part pillow ...
all carnage .
pierce hawthorne has transformed himself
into an unstoppably plush juggernaut .
guys , guys , let &apos;s retreat . go , go !
the war won &apos;t stop with first blood part ii .
it will escalate to rambo iii ,
which should really be called rambo ii : first blood part iii .
but the rambo titles never made sense .
and neither does war .
abed nadir .
facebook status update .
leonard likes this post .
why are you ignoring me ?
what &apos;s the point of talking to you ?
your words don &apos;t mean anything .
they &apos;re just things you say to get what you want .
well , that &apos;s what conversation is , annie .
people saying things to get stuff .
then maybe you should just shut up .
do you ever just ...
write stuff down in a journal , jeff ?
one you don &apos;t show people or use to get anything with ?
a place that &apos;s just for you to ...
sort out the truth ?
if i write stuff down in a hello kitty book ,
will you like me again ?
i &apos;m taking that as yes .
the war brings out the worst in people .
worse yet , troy &apos;s forces intercept an email
written by abed to his commanders ,
outlining troy &apos;s weaknesses .
troy will hold on until he is broken emotionally .
fortunately , this will not be hard .
he gets distracted by loud noises ,
the color red , smooth jazz , shiny things
food smells , music boxes , bellbottoms ,
boobs , barking dogs ,
and anyone saying , &quot; look over there ! &quot;
he &apos;s insecure about his level of intelligence .
his greatest vulnerability of all is his emotional frailty .
it &apos;s incredibly easy to make him cry .
and he &apos;s incredibly ashamed of that fact .
get away !
unfortunately , the only photographer there
to capture the scene is britta perry .
yeah , gee .
there &apos;s a good one .
pictured here lying down ,
troy &apos;s does not take abed &apos;s email lying down .
hey , dick . read your dumb email .
really enjoyed it . guess what ?
you may have been my best friend ,
but we both know i was your first friend .
and what i know but you don &apos;t know
because you have mental issues
is that you &apos;re never going to have another friend .
because--all caps--
nobody else will ever have my patience with you .
troy barnes . four @-@ part text message .
word got around these two were now hurting each other &apos;s feelings .
and i thought about what annie said ,
and then i thought about what i might do to make things right .
at 8 : 00 p.m. of the second night ,
both sides are honoring an agreed upon cease @-@ fire
so that the infantry can watch the hit tv show
ski , shoot , sing ,
a combination biathlon singing competition ,
which was no fun to watch time @-@ shifted
because then you &apos;d be the last to know who won .
during the cease @-@ fire ,
jeff summons troy and abed to a secret summit meeting .
this has to stop .
tell him .
me ? what about your email ?
you weren &apos;t supposed to see that .
you weren &apos;t supposed to think those things .
guys , look at yourselves .
you didn &apos;t used to be like this .
you were troy and abed .
things used to be easy .
he &apos;s right .
our friendship is dead .
what ?
yeah , i think we should agree right now
that whoever wins this war can stay in the apartment .
loser has to find a new place .
agreed .
uh , i wanted that to go different .
the north cafeteria ,
named after admiral william north ,
is located in the western portion of east hall ,
gateway to the western half of north hall ,
which is named not after william north ,
but for its position above the south wall .
it is the most contested and confusing battlefield
on greendale &apos;s campus ,
next to the english memorial spanish center ,
named after english memorial ,
a portuguese sailor that discovered greendale
while looking for a fountain that cured syphilis .
in a fit of hurt feelings , troy redirects most of his infantry
to the cafeteria .
they arrive at the same time
as 100 pillowtown troops .
just after dawn , the end of the war begins .
big cheddar coming !
aah ! okay , i &apos;m out .
okay i am dead .
well , that &apos;s it .
i just heard from the guinness rep .
he &apos;s not coming .
he &apos;s been fired , in what he described
as the world &apos;s biggest mistake .
i doubt that will make the next edition .
anyway , it &apos;s over .
what a colossal waste of 2.1 / 2 days .
the war has no more reason to continue ,
and yet it does between the two that began it .
they just kept fighting .
like , for hours .
come on , guys . let &apos;s wrap this up .
i don &apos;t want to .
me neither .
why not ?
this is going to be the last thing we ever do together .
we can &apos;t stop .
doesn &apos;t that kind of solve your problem ?
the realization that you like each other so much ,
you &apos;d hit each other with pillows forever ?
knowing that doesn &apos;t feel like enough anymore .
yeah . we &apos;re grown @-@ ups now .
we have grown @-@ up problems .
that &apos;s very clear .
unless ...
you use those magical friendship hats that i got for you .
we &apos;re not stupid , jeffrey .
we know you made those sarcastically .
and i will roll my eyes at both of you
when i put them on your heads because that &apos;s the way i am .
but that &apos;s not the way you have to be .
we might be interested .
okay , then .
here &apos;s your magical friendship hat , and--
jeff .
what ?
you left the magical friendship hats
at the dean &apos;s office .
of course . i &apos;ll go get them .
so jeff went out ,
and he stayed out long enough to make them believe
he had gone back to the office .
that was a nice touch .
there you go .
lucky no one grabbed them , huh ?
britta perry is there to immortalize
the moment on film ...
accidentally while trying to get a picture of the light
hitting a stack of nearby waffles .
pierce , take that off .
i can &apos;t hear you ! your cheeks are in the way .
first entry in my stupid journal .
today i had to run and get two imaginary friendship hats
from an office .
i could &apos;ve just walked around the corner
and the come back , but for some reason ,
i actually went all the way back
to where they were supposed to be .
one was crumpled up a bit . that was troy &apos;s .
the other was just a little dusty . that was abed &apos;s .
i fixed them up even though i was the only one watching
because i settled on a truth today
that &apos;s always going to be true .
i would do anything for my friends ,
which i think is how everyone in the world feels ,
which finally makes me understand war .
guys ...
i wasn &apos;t going to show this to anyone ,
but , uh , it &apos;s pretty profound .
i kind of nailed it .
if you want , i can read it in the documentary .
that is , unless you get tom hanks .
we tried to get tom hanks ,
but he &apos;s too expensive .
so we used the people involved for their own voiceover .
yeah , and i nailed that too .
why are you here at the same time as me ?
tight schedule .
hey , were you in the cape ?
no .
1 @-@ 800 @-@ 555 @-@ 0199
i &apos;ve got goosebumps .
me too . such a great story .
i was on the edge of my seat , and i was in it .
you want to know what struck me while i was watching
that marvelous documentary ?
you can &apos;t get quality programming like that
anywhere else but right here on greendale campus television .
just thinking that same thing .
you can &apos;t get
troy and abed : pillows and blankets .
or any of these other great specials ,
like craig pelton : a year in paris .
from labs to riches : the annie &apos;s boobs story
or that &apos;s enter @-@ chang @-@ ment .
folks , we know you hate these constant pledge drives .
we know you hate them . we don &apos;t love doing them .
we don &apos;t like doing them either .
i &apos;d rather be at home right now .
okay , taking a warm bath with my wife .
old brother , not doing this again .
but if you want to help us out ,
you want to help greendale campus televison stay on the air .
keep the lines on .
we are this closely to lose our
