you &apos;re late .
i know .
she &apos;s worried .
well , i &apos;m here now .
in trauma , we &apos;re concerned with one overriding question ...
... how did this happen ?
i didn &apos;t want you to see me yet .
i know .
tatiana , you look ...
so beautiful .
what was the mechanism of injury ?
how do we see past the mess and confusion of the trauma
to figure out what the damage actually is ?
infinite possibilities
put the patient on the table in front of you .
now you have to figure out -- will they live ?
will you be able to save them ?
or are they a lost cause ?
no shared assets , no children ,
and , of course , there &apos;s a solid post @-@ nuptial agreement in place .
with nothing to contest , it &apos;s just about signing the papers .
the places to initial and sign
are all clearly marked .
red tabs for initials , blue tabs for signatures .
every part of a trauma
tells a different piece of the story .
this is one of the simpler divorces
i &apos;ve seen , actually .
and until you look at
each and every injury ...
so , what are you gonna do ? you gonna sign the papers ?
we have to push , and we have to fight .
i &apos;m not sure we are worth fighting for .
... you can &apos;t see what went wrong .
at work ?
that &apos;s where you decide to do this ? !
you want to lower your voice ?
what does it matter how loud my voice is
when 35 people just saw me get served with divorce papers
in the middle of the emergency room ? !
i am sorry about that , all right ?
that was not supposed to happen .
he was supposed to talk to you after you were done with work .
it &apos;s only been four weeks . four , jackson .
is that -- that &apos;s all the counseling
you could handle before bailing ?
you said you wanted to try !
we did try .
it didn &apos;t work . it didn &apos;t get us anywhere .
we have the same exact fight over and over again ,
around in circles .
i &apos;m telling you -- it &apos;s not working .
then why are we even bothering with counseling ? !
what is the point of counseling
if you &apos;re just gonna suddenly , without even talking , just --
oh , come on . all we do is talk , april .
so , what ? you just -- you just serve me papers ?
just like that ?
do you have any idea what a slap in the face this is ?
how long ? !
how long have i been sitting on a couch
discussing my marriage
with someone who has already checked out ?
that &apos;s not what i was doing .
no , i just want to know when it happened .
when did you decide that you were done ?
she didn &apos;t say that .
yeah , she did .
when did she say that ?
she &apos;s been saying it for three weeks now .
we shouldn &apos;t be having sex .
i hardly think our sex life is our problem .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a problem .
it just -- it gets in the way .
in the way of what ?
you &apos;re just hearing what you want to hear .
i &apos;m hearing what our therapist is telling us ,
and you &apos;re not .
it &apos;s like we &apos;re sitting in on two completely different sessions .
that &apos;s just offensive .
what &apos;s offensive is you keep choosing to ignore --
i &apos;m not ignoring anything !
see ? you can &apos;t ever take responsibility .
you never apologize for anything .
i apologize all the time .
not for the things that matter .
what do i have to apologize for , jackson ?
i am here , and i &apos;m trying .
i want to make this work .
stop ! will you just -- don &apos;t touch it .
sorry .
now , remember , once we remove these bandages ,
there &apos;s gonna be some -- some redness , some swelling .
so ... did you talk to april last night ?
i did .
and ? how &apos;d it go ?
not , uh -- not exactly as i expected .
oh , god . she took it that hard ?
or she didn &apos;t because ...
you didn &apos;t ask her , did you ?
tatiana .
you &apos;re kidding me .
it &apos;s really not that simple .
sure , it is .
you just say , &quot; this isn &apos;t working for me anymore .
i &apos;m not happy . i want a divorce . &quot;
knock , knock !
well , you ready for the unveiling ?
four years &apos; hard work , avery .
well , i &apos;m just the surgeon .
tatiana &apos;s had the hardest job .
this guy . always sweet @-@ talking .
43 surgeries , 4 years ,
3 months , 1 week , and 4 days .
can &apos;t believe this is the last time
you &apos;ll be unwrapping my face .
okay .
let &apos;s do it .
wait . i &apos;m ...
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll be able to look .
hey , what kind of hack do you think i am ?
you are going to want to see this .
trust me .
how &apos;s meredith ?
she &apos;s good , considering it &apos;s her first week of recovery .
good .
what are you up to ?
you &apos;re just ...
you &apos;re so ...
remember how our therapist said that we should be more direct
with what we want ?
maybe you should be more direct with what you want .
i have an hour
until my i &amp; d case .
i &apos;m heading to the on @-@ call room ...
take a little nap .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
too bad you won &apos;t be getting any sleep .
i don &apos;t want to talk , because you know what ?
i know what you &apos;re gonna say !
you &apos;re gonna say &quot; you love me , but &quot; !
you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m going to say !
oh , i &apos;m pretty sure i do . it doesn &apos;t matter ! you don &apos;t !
fine ! fine . then just go ahead .
come -- say it .
oh , my god , jackson !
god ! please ! would you just say it ? !
you &apos;re right . i was .
i was gonna ask you for a divorce
when we went for dinner .
and then again when we stayed in for dinner ... yeah .
... and then things happened .
yeah , well , we had sex , jackson .
that &apos;s what happened . we had sex .
i was clear about this .
my mind was made up .
i knew what was best for me -- moving forward ,
no matter how hard .
i knew there were things that we couldn &apos;t repair .
i knew what i had to do .
and it &apos;s not clear for me anymore .
this -- when i look at you and i stop thinking ...
when i let myself just be with you ...
all i &apos;m saying is , i don &apos;t think
that i want what i wanted anymore .
and what i want ...
what ?
i want you .
you guys had sex . yeah , we did , too .
it &apos;s messy .
stop running away from me .
callie , you and arizona , before you guys split ,
you did the counseling thing , right ?
i mean , an hour wait for a table ?
it &apos;s ridiculous . i &apos;m hungry now .
this was such a better idea .
place looks nice .
changed some things around , huh ?
some new pillows .
i like those .
no , you don &apos;t . you hate throw pillows .
i really do .
yeah , i know .
i &apos;m sorry . you want something to drink ?
yeah .
oh , my god .
they gave us so many fortune cookies .
i love fortune cookies !
i know . i asked for extra .
i &apos;m sorry again about last night getting cut short .
i get it . it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s fine .
yeah , i know .
and ...
look at that .
amen .
thank you for waiting .
you want to know what i was praying for ?
no , that &apos;s all right .
throw pillows .
thousands of them just raining from the sky .
i do not understand their purpose .
they have so many purposes .
they don &apos;t . they just ...
they &apos;re like a pop of color .
get in the way .
i just don &apos;t understand what the ...
you , like , prop up your arms and your feet .
moving them around the house .
plus , it looks nice .
you &apos;re funny .
it &apos;s good , right ?
it &apos;s really good .
told you you &apos;d like this place .
i can &apos;t believe i never noticed it .
i probably ordered takeout every night while you were gone .
and i didn &apos;t realize this place was right around the corner .
okay .
what ?
we just sat down to eat .
i @-@ i thought we were having a nice time .
we are .
so why are you gonna ruin it by picking a fight ?
no , i &apos;m not .
i wasn &apos;t picking a fight . i was just talking chinese food .
and jordan .
and takeout .
i am not the one getting defensive .
and i am ?
look ...
i did not come here to fight tonight .
okay .
okay ?
okay .
so , why did you come here ?
throw pillows , obviously .
i saw you had a , um , nasal septum reconstruction
up on the board today . is that for tatiana ?
uh , yeah . her final surgery .
she &apos;s come such a long way . you should be so proud .
i am .
i mean , i @-@ i will be once it all kind of comes together .
i &apos;ve performed so many surgeries on her , you know ,
that her face is just this road map , you know ,
of an incredible journey that we &apos;ve been on together .
i &apos;m rambling . i &apos;ll stop .
we really should talk , though .
we are talking .
yeah , i mean ...
really talk .
about us .
obviously it &apos;s not easy , you know ?
i do think it &apos;s right .
if you &apos;re struggling this much ,
maybe that should tell you something .
maybe you should stop before you say whatever it is --
we need to talk about getting a divorce .
april ...
okay .
come on . don &apos;t --
we &apos;re not even living together .
okay , this is the first substantial conversation
we &apos;ve had in , what , months ?
well , that is your choice and not mine ,
&apos;cause i &apos;ve been here .
i &apos;ve been willing to have any conversation .
don &apos;t do that .
don &apos;t blame me .
i &apos;m not blaming you .
it &apos;s not blame . it &apos;s just fact .
i want to talk to you ,
but we &apos;re having two different conversations
&apos;cause i want to work on things and you just want to end them .
i &apos;m not being flip about any of this .
you actually believe that i &apos;m taking this lightly ?
it just seems like you are looking for an excuse
to walk away instead of putting in any of the work --
you left me !
you walked away !
you -- you ran halfway across the world ! how co--
&apos;cause i was dying , jackson !
塞缪尔 died , and i died !
until jordan , until i was able go over there and --
and what ?
you think i was somehow just fine after samuel
you don &apos;t think i was dying , too ?
no . no , okay ?
you weren &apos;t . not like me .
you were coping .
you -- you were okay .
i couldn &apos;t even ...
and then i found something .
i found something over there that i needed so badly !
and i thought that you understood that !
i wasn &apos;t coping .
i was covering .
for you . i was ...
to take care of you .
and now you &apos;re punishing me over and over
because i dared to take things into my own hands
because i recognized the spiral i was falling into ,
and i went and did something about it ?
i was putting you first .
that &apos;s what you do in a marriage !
or i guess that &apos;s not what you do .
i don &apos;t -- i took care of myself so that i would survive !
and all that does is make you angry .
look at you .
what ...
what is it , jackson ?
what -- what pisses you off so much --
that i chose to go after the thing that i needed to heal
or that the thing i needed wasn &apos;t you ?
the thing that i needed was you !
i survived .
you survived .
but i do not think we can survive this .
no , i &apos;m not getting divorced , jackson , okay ?
no one in my family has ever been divorced .
everyone in my family has .
sometimes marriages just don &apos;t work out .
it &apos;s not just the harder thing sometimes .
maybe sometimes it &apos;s healthier .
i &apos;m not giving up on us . i won &apos;t .
you already did .
my god !
stop saying that !
you take for granted
that i &apos;m just gonna wait for you ,
and wait and wait , no matter what !
but divorce is not some dirty word , april , not for me .
in fact , right now ,
it &apos;s a light at the end of a really dark tunnel .
what are you doing ?
really ?
that &apos;s what this has been to you ?
oh , i &apos;m so sorry i kept you locked away in this prison camp !
you just want to end it , huh ?
is that what you &apos;re saying ?
that &apos;s not what i said .
you just want to pretend like this -- - well , what are you saying ?
you would know if you would listen !
i am listening !
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m throwing cookies !
why ? !
because !
because why ?
i don &apos;t know !
you &apos;re being ridiculous ! stop !
i know !
stop .
i know !
what ...
what is happening to us ?
i don &apos;t ... know .
how did we get to this ?
i don &apos;t know .
how do we make it stop ?
wait .
wait .
what ?
we should ... probably not do this .
probably not -- not a good idea .
no . yeah , absolutely .
it &apos;s not a good idea .
all right .
you know what they call that ? divorce .
and it wasn &apos;t an ultimatum . i gave you a choice .
where &apos;s my maxillofacial consult ?
on the way .
g.c.s. is 9 .
pupils are asymmetric . we need to establish an airway .
what do you got ?
he fell 20 feet .
c6 @-@ 7 unstable fracture .
he &apos;s breathing on his own , but he needs a secure airway .
okay . laryngoscope , please .
wait . why are you here ?
airway . you paged me .
i thought you were going to the airport ,
flying to jordan with april .
yeah . n @-@ no .
um , yeah , i decided not to go , actually .
uh , scope , please .
is this flight 2703 to jordan ?
i need to get on that plane .
i &apos;m sorry , sir ,
but once the doors are officially closed ,
there &apos;s really noth--
please , okay ?
my wife &apos;s on that flight .
i just need to get to my wife , so if you could just --
oh , my god . that is so sweet .
so you &apos;ll open the doors ?
no .
are you kidding me right now ?
i &apos;m sorry .
there &apos;s nothing i can do .
your plane &apos;s leaving .
what ?
what the hell do you mean
that owen &apos;s not gonna be there with you ?
i &apos;m not gonna be there alone .
there &apos;s a whole unit of us .
we work together . we &apos;re -- we &apos;re friends .
i mean , we &apos;re more than that . we &apos;re like family .
we have each other &apos;s backs . we get each other .
like i don &apos;t get you , right ?
come with me . come on .
i @-@ it &apos;s not too late . i can make a couple phone calls .
no .
we always need more surgeons over there .
april , no . my answer hasn &apos;t changed .
if you could just see what it &apos;s like over there ,
the work we do .
it &apos;s important .
it &apos;s immediate . it &apos;s essential .
there &apos;s no filter .
there &apos;s no time to even ...
so often around here ,
we , like , walk through life
and get caught up with all this stuff .
there &apos;s no stuff over there .
every day , every patient has purpose .
it has meaning .
i @-@ i want you to know it the way that i know it .
and i can &apos;t just pick up and go .
i have commitments .
i have people .
who ? who ?
what people do you have here
that would prevent you from coming overseas with me ?
patients .
i mean , i &apos;m not willing
to just abandon people that depend on me .
and i am ?
kind of .
kind of , yeah .
i &apos;m still getting a lot of necrosis .
i &apos;m afraid that
the stupid paramedian forehead flap is dying -- again .
this is the second one .
i do not know why this is happening .
i harvested two blood vessels this time
just to make sure that it wouldn &apos;t --
i was so careful to avoid clotting ,
but it &apos;s still just ...
i &apos;m sorry . we &apos;ll figure this out .
this isn &apos;t your fault , you know .
maybe my face just doesn &apos;t like forehead flaps .
you will figure this out .
you always do .
it &apos;s not like we haven &apos;t had setbacks before .
yeah .
i know . it &apos;s just ...
just crappy &apos; cause this one &apos;s happening right before christmas
when your wife &apos;s off being some kind of superhero in a desert .
and , i mean ...
i was around for what happened this time last year ...
when you lost 塞缪尔 .
and i know , well ...
things have to be tough for you right now .
come on ! just give me a signal ! just ...
damn it !
come on , come on , come on , come on , come on .
come on !
do you need more anesthetic ?
no , i &apos;m okay .
i heard you were down here .
what happened , baby ?
it &apos;s nothing . it was just an accident at home .
have you heard from april ? did she call you today ?
she &apos;s busy over there , you know .
i mean , she probably doesn &apos;t even realize what day it is .
how can i help you ?
what do you need ?
you know , i could use more lidocaine with epi ,
if you wouldn &apos;t mind .
i &apos;ll find some .
god !
it is so good to be back .
april . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m not working .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m not ready to work yet .
i &apos;m gonna head in to work .
you have breakfast ?
you know , you haven &apos;t been to church in a while .
what do you say we go together ?
look at me , sweetheart .
what if we ...
try again ?
let &apos;s try for another baby .
why would you say that ?
no , i just want --
what ? !
what do you want ?
april ...
screw you .
screw you for even suggesting that .
screw you .
okay .
all right .
i &apos;ll go .
i &apos;ll just go in to work .
get off of me !
okay , just calm down . i know .
get off !
warren !
i was just marking her face for surgery .
that marker reeks ! i don &apos;t
want it near my face !
all right , guys , uh ...
she keeps trying to take off her bandages .
i &apos;m not doing this anymore ! i can &apos;t ! i &apos;m done !
all right , warren , wilson , give us a minute .
hey , tatiana , what is going on ?
what is it ?
i had a life before this !
i had a life !
then i was in the wrong place at the wrong time ,
and now my face is melted off of my face !
it &apos;s been a year and a half ,
and there &apos;s so much more to go .
so many more surgeries !
and with each one , you get better .
this is my life now --
these walls , this bed , you !
i want it back .
i want it all back to who i was before .
i know .
i know .
oh , hey . good morning .
hey , morning . morning , sir . yeah .

hey .
hey !
oh , all right . all right .

we are actually celebrating a baby .
i am pregnant .
oh , my god !
holy crap .
congratulations .
thank you !
congratulations !
thank you ! thank you !
work it out .
it &apos;s one small concession .
it &apos;s not small .
look , we are about to tell my parents
that we got married , eloped .
they wanted to be at my wedding .
they thought they were at my wedding .
i &apos;m just not comfortable with it .
i mean , you know that .
i know that you &apos;re not religious .
so why are you asking me to lead your family in prayer ?
because they &apos;re predisposed to not like you .
you &apos;re marrying a rich , handsome surgeon .
stop it . i know .
we embarrassed them .
and we will apologize for that .
sincerely , okay ?
but i &apos;m not gonna change who i am
just to get your parents to like me .
no , no , no .
no , i don &apos;t want you to change who you are .
you want me to lie .
no . come on .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s a gesture of good faith .
my gesture of good faith
is being a wonderful husband to their beautiful daughter .
it &apos;s one day .
one prayer .
not like i &apos;m asking you to go get baptized .
i &apos;m not .
their first real impression of me .
what happens after at the holidays
when i &apos;m suddenly not praying ?
well ...
are you kidding me ? you --
attention , ladies and gentlemen ...
you want this to go on for how long exactly ?
no , i just -- i just want them to like you and accept us .
well , if you respect me , they will .
jackson . please . i -- - you know what ? no .
april , this conversation &apos;s over .
excuse me ?
you knew who i was when we got married .
okay ? we talked about this .
we negotiated our whole wedding around it .
i thought that we agreed
that we would respect each other &apos;s differences .
so , yeah , for me , this conversation &apos;s over .
just over ?
yeah . i &apos;m done with it .
maybe i didn &apos;t --
maybe i didn &apos;t know who i was marrying .
really ? okay .
yeah , because you know what ?
the way that you &apos;re speaking to me right now ,
the way that you &apos;re acting , is not who i married .
yeah , i could say the same thing .
you &apos;re right , because you know what ?
we thought about it for all of like 18 hours .
what are you saying -- you wish we hadn &apos;t got married ?
no .
ladies and gentlemen , may i have your attention ?
we are now beginning our initial descent
into port columbus international airport .
please raise your tray tables
and place your seats in the upright position .
my parents are picking us up .
you want the rest of my peanuts ?
i &apos;m allergic to peanuts .
it looks like a lovely wedding .
congratulations again .
she &apos;s a really ... beautiful bride .
hey , what &apos;s wrong ? are you feeling pain ?
no . no . i &apos;m not .
it &apos;s just ...
look at me .
i &apos;m hideous .
no . do not say that .
no one will ever look at me
the way you &apos;re looking at april in these pictures .
tatiana , you &apos;re wrong .
please .
okay ? i look at you ,
and i see such incredible strength .
i see bravery .
i see humor and persistence ...
beauty .
now , these surgeries , they &apos;re gonna give you back a face ,
but don &apos;t you dare for a single moment
think that you &apos;re not already beautiful .
oh , i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re doing this .
i can .
you may now kiss .
i know you think it &apos;s silly .
well , i didn &apos;t say that .
but i &apos;m serious , okay ?
no premarital sex .
how serious ? like &quot; absolutely not &quot; serious
or &quot; i could be convinced &quot; serious ?
we will survive one more night .
speak for yourself .
if we wait ...
... our wedding night will be so amazing .
and tonight could also be ...
so amazing .
okay .
okay .
you ...
what &apos;s that ?
good night , jackson .
i &apos;m gonna go now .
good night , jackson .
you put the chain on ?
i &apos;ll see you in the morning .
all right .
forget something ?
what time ?
what about this one ?
i really have my heart set on getting married in white .
the wedding dress you &apos;re wearing is gorgeous .
i know a cleaner who can get that stain out .
yeah , thank you , but i need a new dress .
i &apos;ll see what i have in the back .
thank you . thank you .
yes , thank you . bye .
all right .
we &apos;ve got ourselves a justice of the peace .
tomorrow afternoon , he will marry us .
uh , a justice of the peace ?
okay , so , um ...
our wedding will be ...
legal . yeah .
he &apos;s got a license .
he &apos;s not an elvis or a pirate
or a cartoon character .
i @-@ i -- i had just really hoped that we &apos;d find a minister .
someone nondenominational , obviously ,
but , you know , just someone who &apos;s at least been ordained .
april , i &apos;m not religious .
no , i know , i know .
just having someone
with some sort of relationship with god marry us
is kind of important to me .
i mean , even finding this guy
wasn &apos;t easy on such short notice .
i mean , having a wedding without a lot of god talk
is kind of important to me .
i always had such , like , a clear idea
of what my wedding would look like .
want me to bring you back to the barn , or were you --
no ! stop it , jackson . no .
i just want god at my wedding .
i want him there for the most important day of my life .
well , you know that after we get married ,
i &apos;m not gonna turn into this churchgoing guy .
you know , i watch football on sundays .
you are not changing who you are ,
and i do not want you to .
but you can &apos;t expect me to change who i am , either .
how &apos;s this one ?
right idea , wrong color .
okay .
i &apos;ll make some phone calls ,
and we &apos;ll find an ordained minister .
thank you .
did you see what we just did there ?
we disagreed .
we discussed .
we compromised .
we are pretty amazing at this marriage thing .
we are .
this one ?
oh , my gosh !
oh , my gosh ! oh !
no , no , no , no , no ! don &apos;t look !
it &apos;s bad luck ! it &apos;s bad luck !
yes , yes , yes !
no , no , wait . you can &apos;t steal all my fries .
sure , i can . what &apos;s mine is yours .
what &apos;s yours is mine .
we &apos;re not married yet .
oh ! ooh ! aw , crap . sorry . crap , crap , crap . oh , no ! aah !
you know what ? no more fries for you .
it was an accident .
no , no . no more .
hey .
where are we gonna live ?
after ?
well , i was thinking ... what about my place ?
absolutely .
really ?
yeah .
it &apos;s way nicer . it &apos;s bigger . it &apos;s perfect .
great .
but i &apos;m not changing my name .
what ? avery &apos;s a great name .
so is kepner . you want to take it ?
sure .
really ?
no .
no , i &apos;m not changing my name .
okay .
i didn &apos;t expect you to , either .
that &apos;s not really a thing for me .
it &apos;s not ?
no , definitely not .
what ?
holy crap .
we did this !
we are doing this .
we &apos;re doing this .
i love you . i always have .
even the things i don &apos;t like , i love .
you &apos;re getting married ?
unless you can give me a reason not to .

tatiana flauto , 30s .

i will not leave your side .
i promise you .
okay ?
all right .
let &apos;s get mepitel and xeroform , please . oh .
jackson . hey .
it &apos;s okay . really .
i lost some -- some friends that day .
i hate sloan .
even when i &apos;m perfect , he talks to me like i &apos;m an idiot .
well , try spending a day in the e.r. with dr. major owen hunt .
that man is dark .
he is a dark , pig @-@ stabbing , scary man .
what ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
this is where reed was shot ...
where i found her .
i slipped in her blood right there .
i haven &apos;t been back here since .
there &apos;s an elevator upstairs near where charles died .
i never use it .
you -- you okay ? hey .
oh . okay .
i know . i know .
okay ? we &apos;re -- we &apos;re here .
we &apos;re okay .
i had a gun pointed at me .
i know . i know .
my life flashed before my eyes .
it -- it -- it really did . - shh . okay .
and it was so ...
boring !
i just kept thinking , &quot; i don &apos;t want to die a virgin . &quot;
you can fix that .
was that a proposition ?
no , i meant -- oh , oh !
no ! no , no , no , no . i @-@ i didn &apos;t mean --
no , i -- no .
i was -- i -- it was a joke . yeah .
i was making a totally stupid joke .
yeah , it wasn &apos;t good . yeah .
okay . i &apos;m ...
en--
what ? good luck with sloan .
well , that girl is weird .
i &apos;m a virgin . yes . so what ?
it &apos;s not something i talk about , okay ?
we all have things we don &apos;t talk about .
she thinks your husband walks on water .
cincinnati , ohio , pediatrics .
thank you .
who &apos;s next ?
uh , i &apos;ll go .
uh , charles percy , brookings , south dakota .
i want to be a trauma surgeon .
or maybe vascular .
or -- or , like , uh ...
i don &apos;t know , actually . uh ...
all right , well , you &apos;ve got a lot of time
to figure that one out .
who &apos;s next ?
uh , right here .
jackson avery , originally from boston --
oh , h @-@ h @-@ hold on . what ?
like &quot; harper avery &quot; avery ?
uh , yeah , actually .
anyway
so you &apos;re , like , born to the throne .
you know what ? i wouldn &apos;t --
do you know a catherine avery , the urologist ?
i do , actually .
are you writing this down ?
she &apos;s just , like , amazing .
are you going into urology , too ?
no . cardiothoracic all the way .
can i be done now ?
i &apos;ll go !
hi . i &apos;m april kepner .
i &apos;m from ohio ,
and i &apos;m super @-@ excited to be near the ocean ,
although i don &apos;t really know how i feel about the rain yet .
as far as specialty goes ,
i &apos;m looking for something with set hours
so that i can raise kids eventually --
two boys and a girl .
so i &apos;m thinking plastics , urology , proctology .
we talk about the mechanism of injury ...
... about where it all started .
but the truth is ...
it &apos;s sort of a myth .
we can &apos;t boil every injury down to one single blow .
this is one of the simpler divorces i &apos;ve seen , actually .
you want this ?
do you really want this ?
okay .
what hurts us is cumulative .
it happens over time .
we absorb blow after blow ...
... shock after shock , painful hit after hit .
is there anything else ?
uh , that &apos;s it . no .
okay , then .
but even then ...
even if we know exactly how we got here ...
it doesn &apos;t mean we can fix it .
too late to back out ?
are you kidding me ? oh !
timothy and i had a huge fight this morning .
it was probably my fault .
well , yeah , with that mouth , probably was .
look , you guys are gonna fight , okay ?
you &apos;ll probably have that same fight for 50 years .
but you just can &apos;t let it become bigger than the two of you .
so , in other words , marriage is hard ...
... but not as hard as getting acid thrown in your face ?
yes .
this mouth . you see ? four years of this .
and yet you still agreed to walk me down the aisle .
you kept every promise you made to me .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry about you and april .
no .
today &apos;s about you , okay ?
let &apos;s get you married .
for you .
you can &apos;t heal every wound .
and that &apos;s okay .
i have to believe it &apos;s okay .
i wasn &apos;t sure what you would be in the mood for ,
so i kind of got everything .
champagne , tequila , pinot noir --
pick your poison .
no , thanks .
what &apos;s happening ?
did you already start drinking ? are you -- are you drunk ?
what ? i &apos;m ...
hungry , maybe .
what ?
you just signed divorce papers ,
and you don &apos;t want a drink ?
what are you -- what are you , pregnant ?
what ?
april .
i have to believe that even if something
seems like it cannot be fixed ...
according to the test i took this morning ,
yeah , actually .
i think i am .
... it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s broken .
