i &apos;m thinking we put the ...
tub here that way you can take a bath
and look out the window at the trees .
but that means we have to move the sink ...
here because there &apos;s no way we can get two sinks on that wall .
okay .
okay , so do you want me to move the tub
or you want to share a sink ?
i have one opinion , and that is that
i just want a tub deep enough
that it covers my ...
knees and boobs at the same time .
yeah , i gotta go . you &apos;re useless . love you .
the dude &apos;s building you a dream house .
i can &apos;t read these stupid things .
you just don &apos;t give a crap .
i &apos;m taking baby drugs to make my uterus less hostile ,
and i don &apos;t know , it makes my eyes dry ,
and i have to squint to see ,
and i don &apos;t really care enough about the tub / sink relationship .
you should talk to that hot o.b.
you are always drumming up reasons
to talk to that hot o.b.
everyone figures doctors are the most responsible people they know .
they hold lives in their hands . they &apos;re not flakes .
they don &apos;t lose track of important details
or make stunningly bad judgment calls .
&apos;cause that would be bad , right ?
oh , look .
nice size , good @-@ looking placenta .
is that an arm ?
yep .
all good . did you schedule an amnio yet ?
we don &apos;t need an amnio .
um ... we don &apos;t ?
of course we do . we &apos;ll set it up .
why do we need an amnio ?
i can think of a hundred reasons why .
you want me to take &apos; em down one by one or all together ?
it &apos;s so nice that there are three of you .
i gotta go . don &apos;t let her shove a giant needle in your belly
before we discuss this .
it &apos;s not giant . 9 inches .
okay , so i &apos;m really sorry about this ,
but with a clinical trial , the paperwork never ends .
have there been any changes
to your memory in the last week or so ?
oh , i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t think it &apos;s worse .
went to see dr. kesten , and , uh , couldn &apos;t figure out
what floor he &apos;s on , but that &apos;s-- that &apos;s always the case .
well , that place is a maze .
did you have a problem or was that scheduled ?
no , well , he &apos;s-- he &apos;s the one who first diagnosed me ,
and i was kind of angry when he said it was alzheimer &apos;s .
i @-@ i called him a quack .
i , uh , figured i should apologize .
well , i &apos;m sure he gets that a lot .
have there been any changes in your schedule in the last week or so ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t work , and , um ...
i get lost on the way to the post office ,
so i don &apos;t do so many errands .
so how about your sleeping and your eating ?
well , we have , uh , breakfast together
before the boys leave .
right .
and lunch ...
well , i @-@ i &apos;m not home till pretty late , so i @-@ i don &apos;t know ...
half a peanut butter and banana sandwich .
well , i make one when we get home , and we share it .
okay . and , uh , what about the drugs ? any side effects ?
no .
okay .
the pink ones make you thirsty .
dry mouth . yeah .
right . right .
and water helps with that ?
yeah .
okay . very good .
ricky , big day .
bring it on .
is this your sister ?
this is my girlfriend , julia .
you &apos;re kidding . he &apos;s been talking about you for months .
i figured , if there was ever a day to take off work ,
it &apos;s when your boyfriend &apos;s getting new lungs .
smart . she waited for the real fun .
all right . let &apos;s do this .
well , your new lungs should leave portland in about two hours .
you haven &apos;t taken any of your cystic fibrosis meds
since last night , right ?
no food , no water , no drugs .
great . so we &apos;ll just do one last workup ,
and then we &apos;ll get you to the o.r.
oh , and , uh , julia , write down your number , please ,
and give it to dr. grey .
why ?
well , so we can call you when ricky &apos;s in surgery if we have any news .
when was the last time you put in an application to the f.d.a. ?
it &apos;s been a while , sir .
well , it would have to be , because if you had
any recollection of what &apos;s involved ,
then you wouldn &apos;t interrupt me
in the middle of compiling 357 pages of an application .
do you know how easy it is to lose one page out of 357 ?
it &apos;s gotta be quite easy .
they look for reasons to kill a study .
do you know what they consider a good reason ?
a missing ...
one missing page .
now you &apos;re a smart man , hunt .
you have leadership potential , management potential .
i mean , i think you shy away from that .
that may well be , sir .
i mean , you can handle a v.i.p. patient .
i mean , if you don &apos;t mention the chief of surgery ,
they won &apos;t ask for the chieief of surgery .
did you mention me ?
i think i did , sir .
now why would you do that ?
did you not know about my application ?
i think i knew , sir .
then what on earth were you thinking ?
your wife , sir . that &apos;s what i was thinking .
just when you thought you were done ,
we need more blood .
well , if there &apos;s any left , it &apos;s all yours .
well , dr. shepherd is going to come up and take a look at you ,
and if these labs are clean ,
then we &apos;re gonna move you up to the o.r. floor .
good .
hey . let &apos;s keep our fingers crossed
and hope that mom gets the good stuff , okay ?
okay .
hey , kyle . what &apos;s this on your neck ?
oh , that &apos;s just my bump . it doesn &apos;t hurt or anything .
we &apos;ve been meaning to make an appointment ,
but ... with everything th &apos;s been going on--
i &apos;m a full @-@ time job .
no , you &apos;re not , okay ? i should &apos;ve called .
well , we have doctors coming out of our ears here .
so i &apos;ll have someone come up and take a look .
it &apos;s just one less thing to worry about .
thank you .
okay .
i was in the cereal aisle ,
and i tripped on one of those big display .
fruit spreads or--or some nonsense and the whole thing .
lido and an epi , please . 5 @-@ 0 prolene .
okay . excuse me .
oh , it &apos;s a cut , mark . you don &apos;t have to show off .
you can give me a couple of band @-@ aids and be on your way .
yeah , that &apos;s not how this is gonna go .
you--you tripped on the display
or you tripped over your feet and fell into the thing or--
the chronology escapes me , richard .
i was more focused on the fact that there was jam
and--and shard glass all over my coat and my pants
and the pants of the store manager , who would not
leave me alone until he packed me away into an ambulance .
oh ! you know , this whole thg is just ridiculous !
this is twice , honey . i mean , your wrist--
it &apos;s those shoes . now they are supposed to tone your derriere ,
but i cannot feel the ground when i walk on them .
i am going to throw them away . if somebody would just give me
a couple of band @-@ a @-@ ai , i can be on my way .
you &apos;re not going anywhere .
no , if you make a big fuss about this--
mrs. webber .
i &apos;m about to put a needle in your face .
i &apos;d be extremely grateful if you &apos;d stop moving .
did they come by with the forms ?
i think i signed 200 of them .
that sounds about right . you just--
you just gave us your firstborn .
you need a drink of water , julia ?
just asthma . sorry ..
nothing brings people together like respiratory disorders .
mm . romantic .
dornase .
it &apos;s mine .
it has julia &apos;s name on it .
rick , why is she on dornase ?
i &apos;m gonna go .
wait , julia , do you-- you have cystic fibrosis ?
go .
no , wait a minute . okay .
nobody &apos;s going anywhere .
do you know how dangerous
cystic fibrosis patients are to each other ?
we know .
your disease isn &apos;t contagious to anybody
in the general population . it &apos;s not like you can &apos;t date .
you just can &apos;t-- you can &apos;t date each other .
you can infect each other with bacteria .
there &apos;s no way you can fight .
we know !
you know how many times we &apos;ve heard the warnings ?
never get closer than 3 feet
from another c.f. patient .
it &apos;s a drag . okay ? there &apos;s no question . i get it .
no , you don &apos;t .
ricky gets it . nobody else gets it .
we both tried dating . people can &apos;t handle it .
people cringe as soon as you start coughing ,
like you &apos;re gonna kill them .
this is dangerous .
depression is dangerous .
living by yourself ...
with nobody who understands you , that &apos;s dangerous .
we spent eight years making small talk
on opposite sides of a doctor &apos;s waiting room .
and one day we decided
that life with risk
is better than not really living .
we desererve to be together .
kepner , you &apos;re on peds today ?
yeah , some kid already puked on me .
okay , so one of my patient &apos;s son has a lump on his neck .
so would you just do a workup on him ,
and if it &apos;s anything , kick it up to robbins ?
fine . you owe me one .
no , i don &apos;t .
i &apos;m doing you a favor . you owe me one .
you &apos;re doing your job .
i owe you gratitude and respect .
i already had your respect .
give yang all your patients today .
i have an s.m.a. embolectomy .
well , i &apos;ll take your embolectomy .
yang can take the rest . you take my wife .
now i want my embolectomy even more than i did before .
she &apos;s fallen and ended up in my e.r. twice .
maybe it &apos;s an inner ear thing , affecting her balance ,
maybe it &apos;s a pinched nerve . i don &apos;t know .
all i know , is you &apos;re gonna run
every test that has a name .
i was looking forward to my embolectomy .
everyone &apos;s unhappy .
get in here .
you paged me ?
yeah , i need you to check my eyes .
i &apos;m not an eye guy .
i don &apos;t know how this crap works .
all right , well , i already did the chart .
i &apos;m , like , 20 / 25 , but i @-@ i @-@ i--
now i need you to look at my eyes through this thing .
maybe it &apos;s glaucoma .
hey , you could get a prescription for pot .
all right . uh , look up .
look down .
doesn &apos;t look like glaucomam .
uh , your cornea looks fine .
good .
yeah , but you still can &apos;t read the chart .
yeah , but if i squint ...
normal people don &apos;t squint . all right .
read the chart , line 8 .
no squinting .
d , c , p , i.
you &apos;re blind .
shut up .
can you even see me ?
yeah , and you look like a real moron .
i need a real eye doctor .
can you even see enough to operate ?
when i do the squinting thing , i see fine .
don &apos;t quit your day job .
yeah , well , you keep squinting like that ,
and you &apos;re gonna get crow &apos;s feet , but i &apos;m good at plastics .
you want me to do something about that ?
i &apos;ve lost too many babies in my time--
addison terminated , sloan disappeared .
i &apos;m not letting it happen again .
i don &apos;t care what kind of baby it is .
okay , you know what ? you can &apos;t be glib about this .
a special needs baby can be a very sick baby .
we could be talking about a lifetime of surgeries
and spital stays and pain .
it &apos;s not all hugging and the special olympics .
amnios come with risks , too .
one in some not @-@ insignificant number
result in miscarriage .
1 in 300 .
she &apos;s not 45 .
the down &apos;s rate isn &apos;t all that high in women her age .
can we--can we have--can we have a minute ? can i just--
there &apos;s no pulling anybody aside .
we have a relationship , mark .
part of that doesn &apos;t include you .
she &apos;s carrying my kid .
all right , if she gets a minute , then i get a minute , too .
ok , you know what ? no one gets a minute .
i have a patient . the patient gets a minute .
i &apos;ve got a friend who can &apos;t see ,
and , uh , she thinks that maybe her , uh , fertility meds--
your friend ?
you think i &apos;m making it up ?
you &apos;re looking for reasons to talk to me
because the last time we spoke ,
you asked me out , and i said no .
so now you &apos;re taking my temperature
to see if i was actually busy
or just not interested .
you can &apos;t ask me out again ,
not after what you perceived to be a rejection ,
because even though your whole rap is about confidence ,
you &apos;re about as self @-@ assured as a chihuahua .
your friend , uh , she doesn &apos;t need my help .
if she did , she &apos;d call me .
so i should just ask you out again ?
it &apos;s a lot simpler , don &apos;t you think ?
are you free for dinner ?
nope . busy .
well , at first i thought it was a benign cyst ,
but it looks like it &apos;s probably a cystic hygroma .
wow . the trarachea &apos;s starting to close off .
well , i &apos;ll move your diverticulectomy .
or maybe dr. stark has time for it .
dr. stark has time for what ?
uh , i &apos;ve got a diverticulectomy .
we &apos;re hoping that you could take it ,
&apos;cause this hygroma needs to come out right away .
oh , good lord . why did you wait so long ?
this thing is a time bomb .
we just saw the patientt for the first time today .
well , so what , the parents don &apos;t have health insurance ?
they do .
well , why didn &apos;t they get this kid to a doctor ?
kyle &apos;s mother has alzheimer &apos;s .
she was diagnosed a few months ago ,
and the father has been working like a dog
so their insurance doesn &apos;t lapse .
and kyle &apos;s taking care of his mom
as much as anyone &apos;s taking care of him .
they &apos;re just underwater right now .
yeah , all right . call protective services .
what ?
at least one of you here understood that , right ?
you can &apos;t take kyle away from his parents .
you just told me
they &apos;re not caring for their son .
they are dealing with an extraordinary set of circumstances .
this happens all the time .
that &apos;s why the state set up a whole department to deal with this .
you know , i &apos;ve got three specialists on their way
in here to look at a tumor ,
so i need this room .
dr. stark--
and you &apos;ve got a surgery y to perform ,
assuming the patient &apos;s airway is not already closed .
if it has , well , he &apos;s probably dead , and then ,
well , yeah , nobody has to call anybody , right ?
you have to call him off .
well , i don &apos;t know . we can call a social worker ,
have &apos; em go in and say hello , ask if they need any help .
it &apos;ll placate him .
no , because once you &apos;re in the system ,
it &apos;ll only get worse .
you &apos;re registered as a parent who neglects his kid .
it &apos;s over .
you have to call him off .
he &apos;s my boss .
believe me , i like it way less than you do .
this family just lost the ground under their feet .
no one likes the idea
of a 10 year old taking care of his mother
but they &apos;re doing the best they can .
maybe derek &apos;s drug helps her .
or she could get the placebo , and in 18 months ,
she doesn &apos;t even know who kyle is .
we can &apos;t let their last couple of years together
become some nightmare where they &apos;re fighting
to keep kyle in their house .
it &apos;s enough of a nightmare already .
we &apos;ll talk to him .
what , so he shoots us down .
it can &apos;t hurt to try , right ?
you need me to take your diverticulectomy
while you remove the boy &apos;s mass , right ?
my assistant knows my schedule better than me .
just check with her .
we think calling protective services is a bad idea .
oh , uh , kyle &apos;s mother may not have a lot of lucid time .
and these years are gonna be difficult ,
but it &apos;s all the family has ,
and so pulling them apart ...
do you know when protective services
pulls families apart ?
when the children are in danger .
when the children aren &apos;t in danger , they go away .
they do something else .
but they can have a knee @-@ jerk reaction
to certain circumstances ...
what , you think they &apos;re idiots ?
i am se that they are not ...
heartless wretches ?
no .
pediatric surgeons can be heartless wretches .
some would argue that i &apos;m a case in point .
but social workers , on the other hand ,
are bleeding hearts , all right ?
they &apos;re earning peanuts ,
they &apos;re doing this thankless work ,
and then they get paind as , what , home wreckers ?
for simply for stepping in
where children are being harmed .
yeah , but the boy is not being harmed .
and you &apos;re sure about that , right ? you &apos;re 100 % sure ?
no shadow of a doubt there ?
ah . that must be a nice feeling , huh ?
why don &apos;t you be a good example for your residents
and make the call ?
what are you writing ?
dr. bailey ?
i &apos;m writing about your ears .
what about them ?
there &apos;s nothing wrong with &apos; em .
well , then can i go home now ?
no , ma &apos;am .
oh , we are wasting everyone &apos;s time .
i tripped at the pharmacy . i have faulty shoes .
i should not be trying to tone my derriere .
that flavor of vanity is unbecoming
in a woman my age .
the supermarket .
excuse me ?
you tripped at the supermamarke , not the pharmacy .
whatever . the pharmacy aisle .
i ... needed some cough syrup .
you don &apos;t have a cough .
uh , can you breathe into this tube for me ?
i &apos;ve had an alcoholic husband long enough .
i know a breathalyzer when i see one .
just breathe into the tube , please .
my husband sent you in here
to test me for inner ear problems
and balance issues .
well , you don &apos;t have inner ear problems .
you don &apos;t have balance issues .
you are having accidents and you are inconsistent
with your description of the accidents .
and those behaviors are consistent with substance abuse .
so i will run a tox screen ,
i would like a list of the prescription drugs in your possession ,
and i need you to breathe into this tube .
the miscarriage rate is lower .
it &apos;s even lower with wildly talented o.b.s ,
and we have wildly talented o.b.s.
it &apos;s a risk no matter who does it .
okay , you know what ? i &apos;m trying to eat ,
which is more important than it &apos;s ever been now ,
because i &apos;m an incubator .
okay , i know what each of you thinks ,
i &apos;m weighing the options , i will decide .
you &apos;ll decide ?
yes , i &apos;m the tiebreaker .
and anyhow , i have the bigger vote .
because as we &apos;ve discussed , i vote on behalf of the baby
and on behalf of the--
vagina .
yeah .
right . that &apos;s not gonna cut it , okay ?
we &apos;re co @-@ parenting , all of us .
this isn &apos;t a joke .
it &apos;s not some cute arrangement where you humor me
and use me for babysitting when you want to see a movie .
this is my child . we &apos;re doing this together .
you don &apos;t get a bigger vote . i &apos;m a parent !
daddy &apos;s mad .
so he says we &apos;re only gonna have one sink in the bathroom ,
like he &apos;s hurting me .
i mean , why do you need two ?
well , &apos; cause men leave wads of toothpaste in the sin .
and if you have your own sink ,
you don &apos;t have to look at it , all dried and congealed
and filled with their fossilized oral bacteria .
i leave toothpaste in the sink .
are you supposed to rinse it every time you brush ?
nobody parented you . it &apos;s just to be expected .
you &apos;re really gonna move out and sell your house ?
are you gonna miss me ?
no , i &apos;m gonna miss having a cheap place to live .
you know , i have trouble seeing fine print ,
but i can still see your paws on my food .
the fact that the two of you haven &apos;t swapped
a life @-@ threatening infection already is a miracle .
so--so maybe god has a soft spot for you guys .
but once this transplant is done ,
ricky will be on immunosuppressants--
ten times more likely to get an infection .
lots of things are risky .
this is suicide .
you don &apos;t know that .
it doesn &apos;t mean anything to you .
you &apos;ve been happy .
we &apos;ve been sick our whole lives .
don &apos;t we deserve some happiness ?
you &apos;ll get it .
don &apos;t act like it &apos;s easy ,
with your gorgeous eyes and your white coat ,
it &apos;s insulting .
i won &apos;t tell you it &apos;s easy .
it &apos;s not .
but people need these lungs .
people can use these lungs for decades .
parents with small children ,
teenagers who are just starting their lives .
if the two of you stay together ,
you could destroy those lungs within months .
these lungs are a gift .
if you squander it ...
what we have is a gift .
do you love someone ?
if you do ...
you know .
it &apos;s rare
and it &apos;s a gift .
end the relationship , or you don &apos;t get the lungs .
so it &apos;s a cyst , and it &apos;s pushing on kyle &apos;s air way ,
so we should remove it as soon as possible .
but once it &apos;s out , he &apos;ll be fine .
and dr. robbins is great ..
also , a social worker may be coming by
just to talk to you and see how things have been going .
is that part of the clinical trial ?
no . it &apos;s more of a formality than anything .
yeah , thank you , but , no .
well , if-- if it &apos;s part of the experiment , we should do whatever--
no , they &apos;re worried about kyle , okay ?
it &apos;s not part of the experiment .
wh @-@ why ?
ky @-@ kyle &apos;s fine . you just said that he &apos;s--he &apos;s--
if we refuse , what happens ?
wait , wait .
wh @-@ what &apos;s wrong with kyle ?
no ,
they--they think that we &apos;re not taking care of him .
what ? i &apos;m fine . i don &apos;t need anything .
what--what are you doing ? i &apos;m not doing this .
i don &apos;t want to stay here .
allison , honey , stay in the bed .
allison , stay in the bed .
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t--
i don &apos;t want them to touch my son !
i understand , but--
i don &apos;t want this !
no , we are taking care of our son !
i don &apos;t want to be here .
i want to go home .
listen , you need this surgery . all right ?
i don &apos;t .
they &apos;re taking my son !
don &apos;t let them touch our son !
all right , but--
please ! just take me home !
she loves johnny cash .
he does this , and it ...
always calms her down .
i need an answer .
is it over ?
yeah . it &apos;s over .
okay .
okay .
you need to say good @-@ bye .
right now .
this minute ?
we need to prep you and then cut your chest open .
so , yes ...
this minute .
hey , hey , meredith .
um , what was the deal with adele webber
when you saw her a few weeks back ?
oh , she fractured her wrist .
yeah , but you ordered a head c.t.
just to be sure , and it was clear .
okay , i read the file . what i &apos;m asking for
is a more complete impression of the patient .
i myself just accused her of being either a wino or a junkie ,
and that seems not to be the case
&apos;cause the tox screen was clear and so was the breathalyzer .
so i &apos;m wondering what the hell is going on .
she fell down , and she couldn &apos;t get her story straight .
i tried to talk to the chief , and he got very angry with me
because i suggested that there was some indication of early dementia .
and he thinks , because i &apos;m on derek &apos;s study ,
that i see alzheimer &apos;s everywhere .
are you concerned ?
yeah .
did you really call the chief &apos;s wife a wino ?
my finest momen .
i am so grateful you &apos;re not trying to knock me up .
you &apos;re welcome .
the three musketeers are all freaked out
about having an amnio ,
and meredith is getting shot up every day with fertility drugs .
it is a nighghtmare , the whole thing .
and all for what ? just to sign up for ,
uh , two years of sleep deprivation and feces ?
i &apos;m so happy we &apos;re never gonna have to deal with that .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
i want the amnio .
i just--i want to have the information , whatever it is .
that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m gonna act on it . it just--
i--whatever the situation is , i want to know about it .
okay .
thank you .
well , that &apos;s it .
well , i just wanted her to think about it .
i wanted all of us to really think about it .
and you did .
there &apos;s three of us . i got out voted .
as long as my 33 % is considered
and nobody &apos;s body parts get more a vote than i do ,
that &apos;s all i can ask for .
all right , allison , the anesthetic is in .
i just need to make a slight incision ,
and we should be good to go , okay ?
all right . good .
you want to celebrate by drilling some burr holes ?
i would love to .
okay , on the black mark .
easy in , easy out .
ready ?
what &apos;s the matter ? just go ahead and start .
i can &apos;t .
can &apos;t what ?
i can &apos;t see it .
they &apos;re lying .
she &apos;s just gonna lay low for a couple of weeks ,
and then they &apos;re gonna get back together
and destroy this perfectly good pair of lungs .
she &apos;s probably still in the hospital .
you want to stop the transplant ?
it &apos;s too late . lungs are on their way .
the clock &apos;s already ticking .
maybe it &apos;ll be okay .
you know , m @-@ maybe it &apos;s not a waste .
they love each other . it--it is rare .
what if they are soul mates ?
and you &apos;re thinking about sloan again .
no . why ?
he told callie that he would be happy
to raise a special needs child . okay ?
he &apos;s a good man .
i didn &apos;t think about it when i walked away .
i just got mad and i walked .
you did think about it . you think about everything .
okay , what if i was wrong ?
you really want to be dating a guy , two women , and a baby ?
okay , well , th sounds bad .
you think ?
doctor .
yeah .
uh , i said i &apos;m never having kids ,
and you said &quot; yeah , yeah , yeah . &quot;
uh , what exactly does &quot; yeah , yeah , yeah &quot; mean ?
well , of course you don &apos;t want to have kids . you &apos;re a resident .
i felt the same when i was starting out ,
so i figured we could , uh ,
revisit this conversation down the line .
we already discussed this .
yes , but people change .
and it &apos;s possible , in a couple of years ,
you &apos;ll come around .
when have you ever known me to come around ?
the idea that your career
is the only thing that will ever matter to you
is frankly a young person &apos;s notion .
and after what you &apos;ve been through these last few months ,
i would &apos;ve thought you &apos;d have a more ...
nuanced vision of this whole thing already .
okay , so--so--so you assumed that i was gonna grow up
and that i &apos;m going to get over my childish vision of my life ?
well , that &apos;s one way to put it .
i also thought that you might find a little room
for my vision of life .
well , i &apos;ve grown up as much as i plan to .
and ... i don &apos;t come around .
dr. avery .
ready ?
yep . here i come .
okay .
got it .
got it ? great . pickups and potts scissors .
dr. grey , bring &apos; em over .
god , they &apos;re beautiful .
he wastes these ,
i swear to god , i &apos;ll kill him ..
are you still gonna love me if i &apos;m blind
or does it all go out the window
if i &apos;m not a surgeon anymore ?
it--it &apos;s not funny .
i don &apos;t know how you went into my o.r. and didn &apos;t say anything .
it wasn &apos;t intentional .
it started out as fuzziness in the morning .
and then i didn &apos;t see the big black spa
until i startestaring at allison &apos;s skull .
metzger &apos;s gonna meet you in ophthalmolo
as soon as he &apos;s out of surgery .
he could be a while , so cancel the rest of your day .
and you need to stop the fertility drugs right away .
i can &apos;t . i mean , there &apos;s two pills left in this cycle .
my egg &apos;s about to drop . i can &apos;t stop now .
yes , you can . okay , you know
all the scary side effects they list on the side of the box ?
one of them &apos;s happening to you . you need to make sure
this doesn &apos;t permanently damage your eyesight .
this cycle &apos;s over .
i had a feeling i &apos;d find you here .
the lungs are in .
so far , so good .
gonna tell her i &apos;m here ?
dr. altman ? no .
no , i &apos;m pretty sure you &apos;re gonna leave .
here &apos;s the thing ..
you &apos;re killing him .
you &apos;re taking a gun and killing him .
and there is nothing romantic about a joint suicide .
it &apos;s cruel ...
to you , to him ,
to your parents ,
and to the family that just buried someone .
those lungs are gorgeous .
you can &apos;t do this .
and it always feels like ...
there is just one person in this world to love .
and then you find somebody else .
and it just seems crazy
that you were ever worried in the first place .
you &apos;ll tell him he has to find someone ?
he really has to try , &apos; cause ...
i don &apos;t want him to be alone .
oh , hey .
allison baker
is in dr. shepherd &apos;s alzheimer &apos;s trial .
uh , she has to have follow @-@ up visits
every two weeks for the next three years .
we &apos;ll make kyle come every time .
i @-@ i will do the exam myself every two weeks .
look ...
kyle--he &apos;s not just loved , he &apos;s cherished .
i would like you to consider
putting a pin in the call to protective services .
i thought she &apos;d already made the call .
we didn &apos;t .
oh .
okay .
excuse me ?
better not stay too long . i might reconsider .
run away , dr. kepner .
she &apos;s gone ...
real . i don &apos;t know how to tell him .
well , if i had to hear something like that ,
i &apos;d want to hear it from you .
everything &apos;s clear .
good .
well , she &apos;s just got two left feet .
could be . i didn &apos;t check for that .
sir ...
something &apos;s clearly wrong .
dr. bailey ,
when you &apos;re rolling down the far side of the hill ,
things fall apart .
okay , look , if it was me ,
and my wife was suddenly accident prone
and losing track of details ,
i wouldn &apos;t ask the general surgeon
who &apos;s only been an attending for a year to check her out .
i &apos;d ask the neuro guy--
the very fancy , extremely good neurosurgeon
who happens to be studying neurological disorders ,
like alzheimer &apos;s ,
who happens to be a close friend .
that &apos;s who i &apos;d ask .
but that &apos;s just me .
i just wanted to make sure you were all right .
ricky &apos;s not , that &apos;s for sure .
i told julia that she &apos;d find somebody else .
but ... i &apos;m not sure i believed it .
she will .
yeah , well , what if he &apos;s her--
soul mate ?
you gotta be kidding me with this crap , lexie .
nobody has just one soul mate .
that &apos;d be such a dumb system .
look , ricky and julia deserve better than someone
who makes them sick .
you deserve better , too .
and there is more than one soul mate for everyone .
and someone like you ?
there &apos;d be a line out the door as soon as word got out .
oh , would you be in the line ?
yeah .
i &apos;m in the line .
i think i have veto power .
i mean , i think you don &apos;t bring a human being
into this world if one of the parties ,
like the mother , doesn &apos;t want it .
i mean , what &apos;s there left to discuss ?
all right . let me , uh , get this straight .
you &apos;ve made a decision , and i have no say . zero .
so what if i think having a family
is a huge part of what it means to be alive ?
well , then you married the wrong person .
you know , maybe you did . i mean , it was--it was hasty .
i was a p.t.s.d. wastoid , shivering on the couch . i ...
maybe we didn &apos;t think this through .
stop it .
you don &apos;t get to pull that crap with me .
we got married , not because you &apos;re a basket case ,
but because we l loved each othr and we wanted a life together .
so you don &apos;t get to threaten walking out just because i had
the gall to express an opinion that is different to yours .
you need to think about it .
you have an obligation to at least pretend
that you care what the hell i want .
oh , these are all done . there &apos;s just two more .
i &apos;d like you to join me for dinner .
come again ?
dinner .
uh , right now ?
no , i already ate .
i &apos;m just saying , some other night .
like ...
just , you know , i mean a date .
did you say you wouldn &apos;t call child services
because you wanted to go out with me ?
no . no , actually ...
i wanted to go out with you
because you convinced me not to call child services ,
and nobody has changed my mind in ... ten years .
is that a selling point ?
it cuts both ways , no doubt about it .
if i say no , will you stop giving me surgeries ?
no . come on . that &apos;s sexual harassment .
that &apos;s not my style .
look , just think it over .
if the answer &apos;s no , that &apos;s fine .
i mean , we &apos;ll probably ,
uh , have to avoid eye contact for a while ,
but i mean , we can still work together .
anyway ... think about it .
i gotta tell you ,
i was impressed with mark today .
he--he is really being an adult about all this .
i think ...
i think he &apos;s gonna be a great dad .
yeah . right ?
it &apos;ll work .
you didn &apos;t think it was ...
that impressive .
sure .
he handled it , and not like a 4 year old .
is that supposed to make me excited ?
i thought i was supposed to be
the cranky , hormonal one .
i &apos;m not cranky .
i don &apos;t get excited about mark .
i &apos;m not delighted by mark .
i love you .
and i can honestly say that i &apos;m gonna love this baby .
but mark ?
i somehow ended up agreeing to a lifetime with ...
mark-- a lifetime of decisions :
bottle or sippy cup , basketball or tap ,
dartmouth or berkeley .
christmas morning
with ... mark .
okay .
i never picked him .
and i don &apos;t hate him , but ...
i don &apos;t want a life with him .
and yet , somehow that &apos;s ... what i got .
what am i supposed to do , kick him out ?
i mean , it &apos;s his kid .
yeah , you don &apos;t need to remind me of that .
i never , ever forget that .
okay , we &apos;re gonna go down that road again .
okay , can we just be honest about the fact
that this is some kind of bi dream come true ?
i mean , you get the woman that you love
and--and the guy best friend who &apos;s also a great lay ,
and then you get a baby .
i mean , you get it all . and me ?
this is not my dream .
my dream doesn &apos;t look like this .
lexie !
lexie , are you here ?
yeah , yeah , yeah .
okay , um , stark--
stark just asked me out .
is that not the weirdest thing you &apos;ve ever heard ?
it &apos;s pretty weird . i &apos;ll give you that , yeah .
yeah , yeah , it &apos;s weird , it &apos;s weird , it &apos;s weird .
i mean , he &apos;s--he &apos;s old and mean . he &apos;s like the grinch .
the grinch asked me to dinner , and i said yes .
what ? you said yes ?
there is--there is a nice man under there .
a @-@ april .
you think it &apos;s weird .
i @-@ i do .
but i &apos;m starting to come around to it .
you know , can we talk about it later ?
yeah , o @-@ okay .
well , can i pee before i go ?
april .
what ?
go downstairs .
this is shared space .
just go downstairs !
oh , my god .
we are responsible ...
with our patients .
the problem is ...
we blow it all out at work .
in our own lives , we can &apos;t think things through .
we don &apos;t make the sound choice .
we did that all day at the hospital .
when it comes to ourselves , we &apos;ve got nothing left .
i mean , he knows i don &apos;t want kids .
and suddenly , i &apos;m ruining his vision of the future .
don &apos;t talk to me about vision .
what if i never get to operate again ?
you could be a bartender . i had a very good time .
oh , yeah . the whole five hoursrs you bartended .
free drinks .
you stole those drinks . joe didn &apos;t give you free drinks .
your eyes will clear up . they will .
uh , how &apos;s it going ?
oh , good . i &apos;m good .
uh , metzger &apos;s gonna examine you every day .
until he clears you , you don &apos;t set a foot in an o.r.
well , i can &apos;t hold a scalpel , but i can obseserve , right ?
no , you can &apos;t .
did he just bench me ?
damn .
yeah , she didn &apos;t think she needed to tell me
she couldn &apos;t see .
she figured it was , you know , not relevant .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m more mad at her
as her husband or as her attending .
you were extraneous to the process .
kinda a like cristina . she doesn &apos;t need to talk to me
about whether we &apos;re gonna have kids .
that &apos;s nice .
yeah .
not only do i not have a say ,
she doesn &apos;t even want to discuss it .
they want to hold all the cards .
i want you to imagine for a minute
what it &apos;s like trying to negotiate with two women .
two .
that &apos;s a nightmare .
at least you guys get 50 % of the vote .
i get a measly 33 % ..
i get 50 % ? with cristina , i get maybe 10 % .
meredith won &apos;t even put anything down on the table .
she doesn &apos;t want me to vote , she simply omits the information ...
leaving me with zero .
gentlemen .
chief .
want to join us ?
can i , uh , offer you a 9 @-@ iron ?
yeah , i @-@ i can &apos;t stay .
i just need to borrow shepherd for a minute .
yeah , sure . what &apos;s up , chief ?
and is it worth it ,
being responsible ?
adele was in the e.r today .
is she all right ?
yeah . she just , uh , she took a spill .
nothing serious .
but it &apos;s the second time recently .
so i had bailey work her up .
nothing comes up . c.t. , everything &apos;s clean .
but she &apos;s ...
foggy .
i need you to take a look .
&apos;cause if you take your vitamins ...
of course .
and pay your taxes
and never cut the line ,
the universe still gives you people to love ,
and then lets them slip through your fingers like water .
and then what have you got ?
