boy , do i have to urinate .
if only there were a solution to that .
seriously .
i feel like i &apos;ve got a fish tank in my pelvis .
so go to the bathroom .
i can &apos;t .
why not ?
because i &apos;m trying to decide
between getting an xbox one or a ps4 .
oh , &quot; pee . &quot; why &apos;d i say that ?
forgive me for asking a stupid question ,
but why are you being stupid ?
i &apos;m not being stupid .
i &apos;m employing the work of dutch researcher , mirjam tuk ,
who found that people with full bladders
make better decisions .
why did i pee before i decided to move in here ?
oh , how &apos;d the audition go ?
i killed it .
i was even able to cry real tears right on the spot .
oh , that &apos;s great .
i know .
next time i get pulled over for a speeding ticket ,
here come the waterworks .
here come the waterworks !
aren &apos;t you gonna ask ?
what is this , my first day ?
can i get your opinion on something that happened at work today ?
of course .
yeah , sure .
okay , well , i did something
that will either make me look like a lovable goof
or a horrible monster damned to spend eternity in hell .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s lovable .
i &apos;m gonna go with monster . what do you got ?
well , there &apos;s this lady in our office who &apos;s retiring ,
and they were passing around one of those big cards
for us to sign ...
okay .
but no one told me she was in
a horrible car accident over the weekend
and what i was signing was not a retirement card
but was actually a &quot; get well &quot; card .
i &apos;m liking my odds here .
so on the card , in the hospital ,
next to the woman who &apos;s clinging to life are the words ,
&quot; hey , vivian . you deserve this &quot; &quot;
&quot; and at least with you gone ,
no one will steal my yogurt out of the fridge . &quot;
no !
&quot; lol . smiley face . &quot;
oh , my gosh .
&quot; p.s. good luck wherever you wind up . &quot;
why didn &apos;t i put money on this ?
hey , that &apos;s my agent . if i got the part ,
it &apos;s still the second best thing i &apos;ve heard all day .
hello ?
am i a terrible person ?
no . no , it was a mistake .
am i a terrible person that it crossed my mind
that she might die and never see the card ?
now i think you &apos;re flirting with the line .
good news ?
no , i didn &apos;t get it .
i &apos;m so sorry .
you &apos;ll get offered something soon.- i kind of did .
the part in that awful horror movie i passed on
came back around .
apparently , it &apos;s mine if i want it .
are you gonna take it ?
i don &apos;t know what to do .
maybe you &apos;ll get hit by a car and die .
lol , right ?
emily , right ?
yeah ...
i @-@ i don &apos;t know if you remember me ...
from the dating web site .
your friend e @-@ mailed me because you were afraid to ,
then you tracked me down and acted like a lunatic ?
yes , rajesh koothrappali .
look , uh , i just ...
i wanted to say i &apos;m sorry .
okay ? you were , like ,
the coolest person i ever found online ,
and i got really nervous
and i @-@ i just blew it .
uh , don &apos;t worry about it .
and if it makes you feel any better ,
you &apos;re not the weirdest guy i &apos;ve met off the internet .
well , give me a chance-- you don &apos;t even know me .
all right ,
here &apos;s your chance .
wha ... really ?
thank you .
fate has given me a rare second chance ,
and i swear to vishnu i &apos;m not gonna blow it .
or normal words followed by a charming smile .
so , first there was playstation-- aka ps1--
then ps2 , ps3 and now ps4 .
and that makes sense .
you &apos;d think after xbox , there &apos;d be xbox 2 .
but no , next came xbox 360 .
and now , after 360 , comes xbox one .
why &quot; one &quot; ?
maybe that &apos;s how many seconds of thought they put into naming it .
can you get the butter , please ?
you know , however , with the xbox one ,
i can control my entire entertainment system
using voice commands .
up until now , i &apos;ve had to use leonard .
then get the other one . pass the butter .
get ... hang on .
i don &apos;t feel like you &apos;re taking this dilemma seriously .
fine , sheldon .
you have my undivided attention .
okay , now , the ps4 is
more angular and sleek @-@ looking .
no way .
yeah , well , it &apos;s true .
but the larger size of the xbox one
may keep it from overheating .
well , you wouldn &apos;t want your gaming system to overheat .
no , see ? well , you absolutely would not .
and furthermore , the xbox one
now comes with a kinect included .
included ? !
yes !
not sold separately .
although ... the ps4
uses cool new gddr5 ram ,
while the xbox one is still using the conventional ddr3 memory .
why would they still be using ddr3 ?
are they nuts ? !
see ? that &apos;s what i thought .
but then they go and throw in an esram buffer .
whoa , whoa . wait a second .
who &apos;s &quot; they &quot; ?
xbox .
you &apos;re kidding !
no , i am not !
and this esram buffer should totally bridge
the 100 @-@ gigabit @-@ per @-@ second bandwidth gap
between the two ram types .
this is a nightmare . how will you ever make a decision ?
you see ? i don &apos;t know !
what should i do ?
please pass the butter !
okay , it &apos;s not me , right ? this script is terrible .
yeah .
i had higher hopes for a movie called
serial ape @-@ ist 2 : monkey see , monkey kill .
you know , it &apos;s still possible
for you to be good in a bad movie .
okay .
&quot; sometimes i feel like i can control
the killer gorilla instinct inside of me ,
but then i see these bananas and i ...
just want to eat them and then kill people . &quot;
what am i gonna do ?
well , for starters , i wouldn &apos;t eat the bananas .
no ... come on !
this is serious .
does it at least pay well ?
less than i was making at the cheesecake factory .
what does your agent think ?
she &apos;s thinking of taking a job at the cheesecake factory .
you know what , why don &apos;t you just do it ?
you &apos;ll go have fun for a few weeks , make some money--
and who knows what it might lead to ?
okay , look , here , page 58 .
i oil @-@ wrestle an orangutan in a bikini .
just to clarify , which one of you is wearing the bikini ?
both of us .
so it &apos;s a family film .
thank you again for dinner .
you &apos;re welcome .
good night .
uh , it &apos;s date night .
aren &apos;t you , uh , forgetting something ?
oh , of course .
did i mention the ps4 controllers light up ?
no .
well , they do .
and then after coffee , we went for a walk
and she told me she always thought people from india
were exotic and mysterious .
so , with my mouth , i said ,
&quot; we &apos;re just like anybody else , &quot;
but with my eyes , i said ,
&quot; straight up , red , hop on my flying carpet . &quot;
so , you gonna see her again ?
yeah , we have plans this weekend .
and if it &apos;s a clear night ,
i &apos;m gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her .
okay , like what ? show me .
i can &apos;t do that to leonard .
this is some powerful panty @-@ dropping stuff .
you have my blessing . go for it .
okay .
penny ,
two of the brightest stars in the night sky
are altair and vega .
and it is said they were deeply in love
but forever separated
by the celestial river of the milky way .
oh , that &apos;s sad .
it is .
but once a year ,
on the seventh day of the seventh month ,
vega cries so hard
that all the magpies in the world fly up
and create a bridge with their wings
so the two lovers can be together
for a single night
of passion .
okay , that &apos;s enough .
quick poll : ps4 or xbox one ?
raj .
uh , xbox one .
penny .
huh ?
leonard .
ps4 .
wolowitz .
both great .
bernadette .
i like the wii .
thanks , grandma .
oh , my goodness .
what &apos;s up ?
i just got an e @-@ mail from my ex @-@ girlfriend lucy .
she ... misses me and wants to get together .
two women at the same time ?
nice job , playa !
really ?
was it the &quot; two women &quot; thing or the &quot; playa &quot; ?
it was the &quot; playa . &quot;
what am i supposed to do ?
how am i supposed to choose between emily and lucy ?
why do you have to choose ? date both of them .
i can &apos;t date two women at once .
zero women-- that &apos;s my sweet spot .
unless you &apos;re sleeping with one of them ,
seeing other people isn &apos;t a big deal .
but what if one of them asks me
what i was up to the night before
and i was with the other one ?
then , what , do i lie ?
yes .
yes .
what do you mean , yes ?
what do you mean , yes ?
were you seeing other women when we started dating ?
no . were you seeing other men ?
no .
were you seeing other men ?
no .
aren &apos;t you gonna ask me ?
come on , really ?
thank you so much for letting us pick your brain .
yeah , happy to help .
so , what &apos;s going on ?
well , i &apos;m having an impossible time
getting my career off the ground ,
and i got offered a role in this crappy horror movie ,
and i just don &apos;t know if i should take it .
well , i have certainly taken some jobs that i &apos;ve been embarrassed by .
i wouldn &apos;t exactly call star trek embarrassing .
i wasn &apos;t .
me , either .
so , what do you think ,
is there a professional downside to doing it ?
well , it &apos;s tricky .
you want to take projects that you &apos;re excited about ,
but sometimes you also have to pay the bills .
when you &apos;re on the set working on something
that you just know in your heart is bad--
not star trek ...
yeah , beam me up . i love it !
anyway , those jobs can be soul @-@ crushing .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m afraid of .
well , i was in stand by me when i was a kid ,
and it was a huge success .
the terrible movies i did came after that .
i mean , imagine how that feels .
sounds rough .
i &apos;m telling you , this business is brutal .
to this day , i hate going on auditions .
okay , i walk in , and i can just
feel them thinking ...
&quot; he was such a cute kid .
what happened to him ? &quot;
and then i don &apos;t get the job ,
and i can never find out why .
honestly , i get so depressed ,
there are entire weeks that i can &apos;t even get out of bed .
okay , this was helpful .
any news on your coworker who &apos;s in the hospital ?
poor thing , she was in surgery for 18 hours .
she &apos;s alive , but she &apos;s still in critical condition .
oh , no .
the one bit of good news is they put her
in a medically induced coma before she read the card .
so , you know , silver linings .
were you like this when i married you ?
don &apos;t worry about it , buddy .
okay , bye .
that was wil-- he &apos;s feeling a lot better .
apparently , he &apos;s 12 @-@ down
in the tv guide crossword puzzle .
did he help you make a decision about the movie ?
no . did you figure out
what you &apos;re gonna do about the two girls ?
as a matter of fact , i did .
i &apos;ve spent so many years living in fear ,
saying no to new experiences ,
but from now on ,
i &apos;m gonna say yes--
yes to love , yes to adventure , yes to life ;
whatever it may be , the answer &apos;s going to be yes .
he &apos;s gonna die alone , right ?
yeah .
yes .
i &apos;m proud of you , sheldon .
you know , i &apos;m proud of me , too .
i &apos;ve done all my research ,
i conducted an informal poll ,
and i &apos;ve arrived at the rock @-@ solid certainty
i &apos;ve made the right choice .
well , that &apos;s got to be a good feeling .
oh , it is .
although ...
oh , crap .
i had the same feeling when i made my dad
buy a betamax instead of a vhs .
you were just a little kid .
yeah , a little kid who picked the wrong format
to record the macneil / lehrer report .
i also was certain
that hd dvd would win out over blu @-@ ray .
how old were you then ?
old enough to know better .
you know , and now that i think about it ,
i stood in front of a case of ipods
and i bought a zune .
what &apos;s a zune ?
yeah , exactly .
it &apos;s an mp3 player
brought to us by the makers of xbox .
what ... no , what are you doing ?
no , no , pick that back up .
you know it &apos;s good . you did the research .
but what if i &apos;m wrong ?
you know what ?
how about i buy it for you ?
how about
i buy you both ?
you know i only have one slot available
in my entertainment center .
then i &apos;ll buy you a new entertainment center .
well , yeah ... okay , sure .
but which one ?
how about this ?
i &apos;ve heard that if you flip a coin ,
it will tell you how you actually feel .
because you &apos;ll either be disappointed
or excited by the outcome .
interesting .
so , heads it &apos;s ps4,
tails it &apos;s xbox one .
all right , i &apos;ll try .
what is it ?
a quarter .
could have given it back to me .
that was a choice .
you look ...
you look really pretty tonight .
thanks .
i love that jacket .
thank you . thanks , thanks .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t do this .
my ... my ex @-@ girlfriend e @-@ mailed me ,
and i &apos;m seeing her saturday ...
and i &apos;m glad you like it-- it &apos;s from j. crew .
i don &apos;t understand .
my friends told me it was okay
to see more than one person at a time ,
but it @-@ it feels like i &apos;m being deceitful .
are you getting back together with her ?
no .
i @-@ i ... i have no idea .
what would you do ?
uh , usually on first dates , i talk about music and stuff ,
but i was promised weird , so let &apos;s do this .
how serious were you two ?
well , to be honest ,
we only went on four dates ,
hugged twice , kissed once ,
and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo .
wait , so ...
a girl you never slept with sent you an e @-@ mail
and you felt so guilty about it that you had to tell me ?
yeah .
that &apos;s kind of adorable .
are you ... are you sure ?
because this is the part of the night
where i &apos;ve said something stupid and the girl usually leaves .
i &apos;m still here .
yeah , but now you make me wonder what &apos;s wrong with you .
we just met .
you don &apos;t need to tell me about other people you &apos;re seeing .
really ?
because &quot; i &apos;m dating two women &quot;
is basically the only cool thing i can say about myself .
on the one hand , the xbox one has a better camera ...
but the ps4 has a removable hard drive .
thoughts ?
i can &apos;t feel my legs .
oh ... i &apos;m sorry , guys ,
but the store closed five minutes ago .
but i haven &apos;t decided yet .
you &apos;ll have to come back tomorrow .
the registers are closed .
let &apos;s get you some food .
y @-@ you &apos;ll feel better after you eat .
okay .
what @-@ what do you want , like , thai food ?
a ... a burger ?
i don &apos;t know !
hey , look , a quarter !
how &apos;s that feel ?
great .
not like regret at all .
penny ?
we &apos;re working together !
awesome !
