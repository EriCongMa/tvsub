you &apos;re the most amazing woman i have ever met .
are you doing what i think you &apos;re doing ?
rachel elizabeth zane ...
will you marry me ?
yes .
yes ?
you want my permission to take mike
and force him to be your associate .
speak now , or forever hold your peace .
i got us something .
the perfect way to consummate our relationship .
so just wait right here . it &apos;s in the kitchen .
sure .
i can &apos;t let you do this .
you &apos;re going back where you belong .
you never cared about me .
all you care about is yourself .
louis , i &apos;m not norma .
i told you i &apos;d never let anything happen to you ,
and i won &apos;t ever .
i should go .
why ?
you know i love you , donna .
you ran away , but not before you told me you loved me .
i did that because i wanted to make you feel better .
i don &apos;t want your pity .
you need to start thinking about a new secretary .
harvey has no idea how lucky he is to have you .
i &apos;m leaving you , harvey .
you can &apos;t just quit .
i &apos;m not quitting .
i &apos;m going to work for louis .
so i told him i &apos;ll cave on the billables ,
but if he wants someone to kiss his ass all day ,
he &apos;ll have to settle for louis .
and what did he say ?
i don &apos;t know , but we got paid
and i haven &apos;t heard from him in a week .
i have to say harvey , all things considered ,
you &apos;re taking this whole donna @-@ louis thing in stride .
well , i may have my issues , but they only make me stronger .
good , because we &apos;re about to walk into a room
packed with people who think they &apos;ve got us by the balls .
well , i don &apos;t care what they think ,
cause i &apos;m gonna kill it .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s going on is i left you five messages
and you never called me back .
the meeting was over an hour ago and you weren &apos;t here .
five messages ?
please , you have to understand , i lost my secretary .
i don &apos;t give a shit . i lost my company .
no , you haven &apos;t .
we can get them back .
i can take care of it .
bullshit .
you can &apos;t even take care of yourself .
sorry , harvey . you &apos;re on your own .
and then what happens ?
and then i get up .
and how do you feel when you get up ?
i told you i don &apos;t wanna talk about how i feel .
then what are you doing here ?
you know what i &apos;m doing here .
i told you , your sleepless nights aren &apos;t going to stop
until you accept the fact that your secretary
isn &apos;t coming back .
and i told you they &apos;ll stop when she does .
so just write me another prescription
and let me get some sleep in the meantime .
it doesn &apos;t work that way .
then how does it work ?
why don &apos;t we start with you taking me
through the whole story again ?
what the hell good is that gonna do ?
you want the truth ?
i think you might have left some things out .
well , i didn &apos;t , and i &apos;m not about to
go through this whole damn thing again .
then go and find yourself another doctor .
because i &apos;m not writing a prescription for anything
without you talking to me .
i ... i can &apos;t stop staring at it .
oh , i noticed .
yeah . so will everyone else .
well , i mean , yeah , that &apos;s the point .
for everyone to realize that you &apos;re my property .
okay .
are you saying you own me now ?
oh , hell yeah , and this here
is just like a little collar for your finger .
mike , seriously ...
i know we told my parents last night ,
but i was thinking that , in terms of work ,
maybe we should keep it to ourselves for a bit .
i understand .
you do ?
sure .
you know , it &apos;s like there &apos;s this bubble around us ,
and you just don &apos;t want it to burst yet .
and you &apos;re okay with that ?
rachel , you just agreed to spend the rest of your life with me .
right now i &apos;m pretty okay with everything .
then it &apos;s settled .
we &apos;ll tell donna and that &apos;s it .
what ?
what about the bubble ? there &apos;s no donna in the bubble .
come on , there &apos;s room for donna in the bubble .
you realize i get to sleep with
whoever &apos;s in the bubble , right ?
so long as you realize that my dad &apos;s in the bubble .
donna it is .
come here . all right .
remember that thing online ?
we &apos;re doing it .
donna , what the hell are you doing ?
what does it look like i &apos;m doing ?
i &apos;m getting rid of these résumés .
no , no . oh , my god , woman , are you crazy ?
i have interviews with norma &apos;s replacements in ten minutes .
oh , that &apos;s gonna be hard considering the fact
that i canceled all your interviews .
damn it , donna ,
those were the best candidates in the city .
no , louis , the best candidate in the city
is standing right in front of you .
but you told me no .
and now i &apos;m saying yes .
this is the most amazing moment in my entire life .
good .
i &apos;ll get you a temp for a couple of weeks
and then we &apos;ll get started .
wait , i &apos;m sorry , wait .
you haven &apos;t told harvey yet ?
i told him . i just-- i have to give him two weeks .
okay , you know what , on second thought ,
as much as i appreciate the gesture ,
i think you should just stay with harvey .
what are you talking about ? this isn &apos;t a gesture .
no , look , you just--
do you remember mike almost became my associate ?
what am i talking about ? of course you do .
well then , you &apos;ll also remember that
just as mike had said yes ,
harvey swoops in
and he takes him back from me at the last second .
that isn &apos;t gonna happen .
what you don &apos;t know is that i left the room .
i went to get mike this cake that said ,
&quot; welcome to team litt . &quot;
two minutes later , i come back and there they are ,
high @-@ fiving , laughing , and then they leave .
i threw the cake out .
i cannot have that happen again with you .
louis , i told you that isn &apos;t gonna happen .
did you not just hear me ?
it took harvey two minutes to steal mike back from me .
with you , he has two weeks .
so no thank you .
donna , i need to get in touch with henderson before lunch ,
and i need to get braxton a bottle of wine .
i took care of all that .
good . thanks .
is there anything else you want to talk about ?
not that i can think of .
did you really think that if you just
acted like i changed my mind that i &apos;d change my mind ?
oh , come on , donna , louis ?
i mean , how long do you think that &apos;s going to last ?
it &apos;s gonna last however long i want it to last .
donna--
harvey , this is happening .
this is my formal notice .
but i have no intention of leaving you high and dry ,
so let &apos;s talk about finding you
someone in the next two weeks .
finding me someone ?
yes .
i already have a list of the top legal secretaries in the city .
you mean you made a list for louis
before you decided to abandon me ?
i &apos;m not abandoning you , harvey .
i &apos;m doing what &apos;s best for me .
well , as long as we &apos;re doing what &apos;s best for ourselves ,
you know what &apos;s best for me ?
ripping the band @-@ aid off .
harvey--
so why don &apos;t you clean out
your desk , walk yourself over to louis ,
and take that with you ?
this isn &apos;t how two adults who care about each other move on .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , two adults who
care about each other don &apos;t move on at all .
so , if you &apos;re gonna go , just go .
what the hell are you doing in here ?
kevin slattery &apos;s been waiting 20 minutes .
what ?
kevin slattery .
didn &apos;t donna tell you ?
no , she , um--
harvey , what &apos;s going on ?
nothing &apos;s going on .
why is kevin slattery here ?
he &apos;s looking for a new lawyer ,
and i &apos;m looking for you to close him .
why me ?
why not you ?
because everybody and their mother knows
they &apos;re going bankrupt in two weeks
and i &apos;m not a bankruptcy expert .
aren &apos;t you listening to me ?
he doesn &apos;t want to declare bankruptcy .
he wants you to fight for him .
then he &apos;s come to me on the right day .
kevin , i hear you &apos;re looking for a fight
and i understand we don &apos;t have much time .
we don &apos;t , and i just wasted half an hour waiting for you .
so , before we get to anything , you &apos;re gonna convince me
why i should go with you in the first place .
okay , we &apos;re done .
don &apos;t let the door hit you on the way out .
what ?
you heard me .
only one of us is facing bankruptcy and it isn &apos;t me .
so instead of scolding me for being late ,
you needed to be convincing me
why i should save your dying company .
so , nice to meet you .
loyalty .
what did you just say ?
i have a game @-@ changing contract that &apos;s guaranteed
to come my way in six weeks if we can show solvency .
guaranteed by who ?
my college roommate .
and you tell that to your bankers ,
word gets out it &apos;s up for bid ,
your competitors undercut you ,
and your roommate won &apos;t be able to help you anymore .
but if we make it six weeks , we &apos;re back in business .
and i guarantee we &apos;ll never leave you .
here &apos;s the thing , kevin .
i don &apos;t give a shit about a regional trucking company
that &apos;s only going to increase our billings 1 % .
i get you out of this ,
your stock &apos;s gonna go through the roof .
you want a piece .
i want 20 % .
no way .
you &apos;re the one coming to me . okay ?
80 % of something is a whole lot better than 100 % of nothing .
you gonna fight out there like you just did in here ?
this is the preseason , kevin .
i haven &apos;t even broken a sweat .
do you have a second ?
yeah , sure . what &apos;s going on ?
donna , are you shaking ?
i never should have - expected him to--
what &apos;s going on ?
you know what ? never mind . sorry .
what did you want to talk about ?
you never should &apos;ve expected who to what ?
what happened ?
i &apos;m leaving harvey .
oh , my god .
why ?
you remember when i told you you could never go back ,
and then i said i lied about that ?
turns out i was lying when i said i lied .
so you &apos;re just gonna leave ?
no , i &apos;m going to work for louis .
what ? when ?
today .
i &apos;m sorry , rachel .
you didn &apos;t come in here to talk about this .
what did you wanna talk--
no .
it &apos;s nothing .
it can wait .
you got something for me ?
when don &apos;t i ?
i redid your shitty motion to dismiss on colter .
my shitty motion ?
yeah , your precedents might as well have been
flintstone v. rubble .
listen to me , the flintstones is an iconic classic
that clearly conveys the fact--
that you &apos;re old ?
hey , you &apos;re the one
who came up with the reference .
which conveys the fact that i &apos;m smart .
wow , somebody took their confidence booster shot
this morning .
actually , i took it last night .
and by took it , i mean i asked rachel to marry me .
oh shit , i wasn &apos;t supposed to tell you that ,
but i just did .
then i won &apos;t say congratulations yet .
oh , no , you can still say it .
i can also say i need a list
of every one of slattery corp &apos;s creditors ,
and i need it yesterday .
now , why would you say that instead of congratulations ?
because we have less than two weeks
to keep them out of bankruptcy
and we can &apos;t do that without knowing every person
kevin slattery owes a nickel to .
harvey , that list is gonna be over 50 names long .
there &apos;s no way we can get to all of them in two weeks .
you know what ? instead of telling me what we can &apos;t do
and asking me for a copy of brides magazine ,
why don &apos;t you just get the damn list together ?
you told him we &apos;re engaged ?
i couldn &apos;t help myself . but i wish i hadn &apos;t told him .
harvey , what &apos;s going on with you ?
nothing &apos;s going on .
congratulations . there , i said it .
where the hell is my calendar ?
you know , i had it right here yesterday .
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ll go get donna .
no , don &apos;t get donna . i &apos;ll take care of it .
what do you mean don &apos;t get donna ?
i said i &apos;ll take care of it .
i &apos;ve got it right here .
thanks , rachel .
harvey specter &apos;s office .
no , he &apos;s not available right now .
can i take a message ?
why didn &apos;t you tell him about donna ?
because i knew rachel knew , and she &apos;d tell him ,
and then i wouldn &apos;t have to waste my time with it .
waste time or feel something ?
you think i wasn &apos;t feeling something anyway ?
and what were you feeling ?
right now , i &apos;m feeling this deposition
is never going to end .
this isn &apos;t a deposition ,
and you &apos;re not getting out of this that easily .
you know what , i &apos;m getting a little tired of your attitude .
and what attitude is that ?
the attitude where i &apos;m not gonna supply
prescription narcotics to someone
who won &apos;t tell me the truth ?
the attitude that says you know me
better than i know myself .
i never said i know you better than you know yourself .
you said i &apos;m keeping things from you .
and that &apos;s something you know just as much as i do .
oh , bullshit . i &apos;ve been telling the truth
this whole time and i haven &apos;t left out a goddamn word .
okay , harvey , if that &apos;s how you wanna play it .
i do know you better than you know yourself .
i had you pegged about four seconds
after you walked in my door ,
which is why i know you weren &apos;t just
washing your face when jessica walked in .
you were washing your face because you threw up .
and you told yourself that you were coming down with something
or you had some bad clams .
but i &apos;ll tell you what really happened .
you threw up because you had a panic attack .
and you &apos;re not coming to me
because you &apos;re having trouble sleeping .
you &apos;re coming to me because you &apos;re scared to death
that it &apos;ll happen again .
mike , can i talk to you for a minute ?
what do you wanna talk about ?
captain dickhead back there ?
look , i think maybe we should cut him a little slack .
no , i cut him some slack when he
barely acknowledged our engagement .
then i tried to get donna to help him
and he bites my head off .
what are you doing ?
donna &apos;s leaving him .
and she &apos;s going to work for louis .
what the hell happened ?
they &apos;ve been through everything together .
what could possibly--
oh , my god , they crossed the line .
it &apos;s more complicated than that .
what does that mean ?
they crossed the line years ago .
you know what ? it doesn &apos;t matter .
i don &apos;t need to no anymore . of course ...
we &apos;ll cut harvey all the slack in the world .
okay , i am going to stay late
and help him get everything in order .
hey , just keep in mind that
cutting him some slack is one thing .
doing donna &apos;s job is another .
it &apos;s just one day .
it &apos;s not gonna last forever .
how &apos;d you find me here ?
easy .
i knew after this morning , you &apos;d come in here
and your standard sandwich of commiseration .
i don &apos;t have a sandwich of commiseration--
rueben on rye , with bacon instead of russian dressing .
well @-@ done bacon .
and if it &apos;s all the same to you ,
i would prefer to eat by myself .
fine .
i just came in here to give you this .
唐娜 · 鲍尔森
you mean ...
today is the day i work for you .
oh , my god .
i can &apos;t believe it . this is really happening ?
what do we do first ?
i mean , i &apos;m so goddamn turned on right now .
i don &apos;t know . maybe we could get a jump on
some of the things that have been piling up since norma .
well , my dictaphone &apos;s at full capacity ,
it &apos;s about to burst .
well , i could help you with that .
would you ?
of course .
that &apos;s my job .
relieving the pressure on your dictaphone .
okay , you know what ? maybe we &apos;re , um ...
moving too quickly .
okay . well , how about
i just redo your calendar ,
and index every live case you have , and then get to know
every single inch of your filing system .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s moving less quickly .
culminating in that inevitable moment
when your phone finally rings
and i say those three magic words .
oh , good sweet jesus .
&quot; louis litt &apos;s office . &quot;
god damn it , woman , we &apos;re going back right now .
take care of the bill . 10 % tip .
well @-@ done bacon , my ass .
he &apos;s totally not thinking about sex right now .
tell me you found all 50 creditors .
not just all 50 . i found the one .
how do you know you found the right one ?
because i know exactly what you &apos;re gonna do .
then let me show you how i &apos;m gonna do it .
you &apos;re really gonna make them do that ?
sure am .
all of them ?
doesn &apos;t work with some of them .
north or south ?
take your pick .
well , harvey , that &apos;s brilliant .
there &apos;s only one problem . it &apos;s illegal .
let &apos; em sue us . it &apos;s civil , not criminal .
besides , we &apos;re bluffing anyway .
what if i told you i have a way to make it legal anyway ?
i &apos;d say your idea better work fast
because we &apos;re going over there in an hour .
vince sanfillipo ?
yes .
is there a reason you &apos;re not turning around ?
i like to play a little game with some of my visitors .
for example , you use evian skin cream
and sometimes you wear l &apos;air du temps .
but not today .
of course i do .
i &apos;m just one generation away from poor white trash .
and i could only dream of getting out .
getting anywhere .
getting all the way to the fbi .
a census taker tried to test me once .
i ate his liver with some fava beans
and a nice chianti .
you see a lot , doctor . but are you strong enough
to point that high @-@ powered--
quid pro quo , clarice--
all right . that &apos;s enough .
we didn &apos;t come here for a quote @-@ off .
no , you didn &apos;t .
you came here to get me to give kevin slattery more time ,
and that &apos;s never going to happen .
actually , we &apos;re here to get you to
buy up every piece of debt associated with slattery freight
and then get you to give him more time .
and why would i do that ?
why ? because you &apos;re the biggest debtholder ,
and if any of the others makes a claim ,
it &apos;ll trigger bankruptcy , and you get 50 cents
on the dollar five years from tomorrow .
you think i &apos;m gonna double down on a loser ,
because you can quote silence of the lambs ?
no , you &apos;re gonna do it
because the day we file bankruptcy ,
every truck in that fleet &apos;s going straight to canada .
and that 50 cents on the dollar just hit 25 .
but that &apos;s illegal and i will sue you
and your client into the ground .
well , it would be illegal
if we hadn &apos;t just a bought a defunct
canadian trucking company for a dollar .
bullshit !
your covenants prohibits you from doing that .
not if we do it before anyone calls in our debt .
which we did .
you &apos;re a son of a bitch .
that &apos;s exactly what i thought of myself
when i came up with the idea .
to be fair , i was the one that came up with
the defunct canadian trucking company thingy .
so ...
oh , yeah , you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re a son of a bitch , too .
oh , thanks , harvey . i appreciate that .
well , now that we agree what we are ,
the question is , what are you gonna do about it ?
what &apos;s so funny ?
i was just thinking about that nutbag .
who starts a meeting off like that ?
yeah , you got to give him credit , though .
it was pretty fun .
you think he &apos;s gonna do that bit with the creditors ?
i don &apos;t care
if he makes them put the lotion in the basket ,
as long as he buys up their debt .
or else it gets the hose again .
wait , was she a great big fat person ?
good job today , mike .
thanks .
does this mean i &apos;ve earned the right
for us to talk about the donna situation ?
there is no donna situation .
harvey , come on , i know you &apos;re not touchy @-@ feely , but--
look , there &apos;s nothing to talk about ,
because it isn &apos;t gonna last .
okay .
i got some georgio &apos;s reheating in the oven .
oh , you are my hero .
oh , i know .
i mean , who says that men can &apos;t cook ?
i think georgio &apos;s does .
that &apos;s a fair point .
so how was your test ?
whoa , it was that bad ?
you studied like crazy .
no , it &apos;s not that it was that bad .
i just ...
i didn &apos;t take it .
what do you mean you didn &apos;t take it ?
i decided to stay late and help harvey .
help harvey what ?
never mind . i know what .
something that would &apos;ve been done by donna
and should &apos;ve been done by his new secretary
except he hasn &apos;t hired one yet .
you &apos;re the one who said we should cut him as much slack
as he needs .
i meant tolerating him being a dick .
not you flunking out of school .
the last time i asked harvey for time off ,
he told me work is my law school ,
and he was right .
i &apos;m not gonna ask him for time when he needs me the most .
what ?
what ?
i was just thinking about
when i asked you to marry me ,
i said how tenacious you are .
well , i know .
it &apos;s like you should know what you &apos;re getting yourself into .
but you see what happens when you don &apos;t wear that collar
on your finger ?
stop it .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re really mine .
now , where would be the perfect place to ...
good morning , louis .
holy shit . you just scared the shit out of me .
what are you doing here so early ?
it &apos;s 8 : 15 .
well , yeah , but we worked late last night ,
and i told you to take the morning .
louis , it &apos;s day two , i &apos;m not taking anything .
oh , shoot .
i get it .
you came in early because you bought me
an expensive gift and you wanted to
surprise me by putting it on my desk .
something like that .
do you want me to go ? you can still surprise me .
never mind .
uh ... being that you &apos;re here ,
i have a prospective client coming in at 9 : 00 .
no , you don &apos;t .
what do you mean ? the asshole canceled ?
no , the asshole intentionally showed up an hour early
and i sent him home , telling him he was an hour late .
what , are you crazy ?
that was carl fields , donna .
$ 12 million in billings you let walk out the door .
no , that &apos;s 12 million in billings that &apos;s coming your way
because now he knows you &apos;re not someone to be trifled with .
no , you can &apos;t know that .
really ? because i just got off the phone
with his secretary , and they &apos;re expecting you to come by
with an engagement letter in an hour .
holy shit !
oh , shit .
what ?
what &apos;s the problem ?
i &apos;m still printing to my old printer .
what , for the engagement letter ?
donna , please , you &apos;ve done enough .
let me take care of it .
like i wouldn &apos;t notice .
there you go , little fella .
i was , i was just ...
it &apos;s fine , louis . whatever you were doing ,
it &apos;s fine .
hey , harvey ,
if there are any hard feelings with donna ...
no , louis . no hard feelings .
okay , but i just want to say , if there was ...
i said there &apos;s no hard feelings .
as a matter of fact ,
why don &apos;t you tell donna i want her to have this ?
she &apos;s leaving you .
you wanted to see me ?
that was an hour ago .
well , i just heard .
and i just heard the results
of your little strong @-@ arm tactic with mike .
you mean you heard that it worked .
oh , i know you got them to do what you wanted .
they bullied all the other creditors ,
bought off all their debt ,
and they &apos;re going to back off for eight weeks .
why do you seem pissed ?
because you left a creditor off the list .
what ? how could that happen ?
i don &apos;t know how it happened ,
but i know what it means .
we &apos;re gonna get held hostage .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
and if you can &apos;t take care of it and slattery goes bankrupt ,
you better figure out a way to keep him here .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
it means jack soloff &apos;s been going around the firm
saying you &apos;re never gonna save that company
and we don &apos;t have a plan to retain their business
when you don &apos;t .
since when do you care about what jack soloff says ?
since he &apos;s a senior partner with ambition
and you dropped the ball twice in the two days .
if you &apos;re so afraid of him , why don &apos;t you just fire him ?
i &apos;m not afraid of anybody ,
and i never said ambition was a bad thing .
jessica--
harvey ,
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on between you and donna ,
but i do know you chose not to let me in on it ,
so i &apos;m gonna let you in on this .
if you can &apos;t figure out how to get shit done
without her , i will .
how &apos;d it go with mr. fields ?
fine , but before you dislocate your arm
patting yourself on the back ,
i need you to file those before you leave today .
all of them ?
yes , all of them . that &apos;s what &quot; those &quot; means .
and then i want you to update my word perfect by the morning .
louis , i have tickets to the theater at 8 : 00 .
second day and you &apos;re already taking banking hours ?
okay , i hardly think 8 : 00 constitutes--
norma worked till midnight eight days a week
and never bunted an eye .
bunted ?
yes , bunted .
you have a problem with my words now ?
okay , louis , i don &apos;t know
if you skipped your afternoon prunie or what ,
but you &apos;re making me feel uncomfortable .
well , let &apos;s get something straight .
i &apos;m not here to make your life comfortable .
you &apos;re here to do that for me .
and the next time you print something to the wrong copier ,
get it yourself .
i gave you one job-- to find every single one
of slattery &apos;s creditors , and you screwed it up .
what are you talking about ?
you left one off the list ,
and as soon as they realize
that we bought out everyone else ,
they &apos;ll know we have a deal
and they &apos;ll call in their debt
and the whole thing will blow up .
wait a second , they haven &apos;t even called it in yet ?
no , they haven &apos;t called it in yet ,
because they &apos;re gonna wait till the last second
so they can hold us over a barrel
because you didn &apos;t do your job .
and now i gotta find some leverage on katzen financial .
i didn &apos;t miss katzen financial .
then why weren &apos;t they on the list ?
i don &apos;t know , they were on the list when i sent it--
goddamn rachel .
harvey !
katzen was the last name on that list
and the only name on that page , all right ?
the printer must have just run out of paper .
this isn &apos;t rachel &apos;s fault .
what am i supposed to tell kevin slattery ?
&quot; the reason you &apos;re losing your company
is because my associate didn &apos;t load the printer &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know , how about you tell him the truth ?
that the reason he may lose his company
is because you didn &apos;t hire a secretary .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
you know what it means .
rachel has been killing herself to take care of you ,
and we haven &apos;t said anything
because we both agreed to cut you some slack .
we ?
yeah , we ,
but i &apos;m not gonna let you come down on her
for screwing up something that wasn &apos;t her job .
her job is to do what i say ,
and you better wrap your head around that .
no , harvey you better wrap your head around the fact
that donna is gone and she is not coming back .
and i told you , it &apos;s not gonna last with her and louis .
you keep saying that ,
but all i see is donna outside louis &apos;s office
and no one outside yours .
so you better swallow your pride and ask her for help ,
or hire a new secretary , but either way ,
you &apos;re done taking it out on rachel .
hey , there , you got a minute ?
barely .
i need those two weeks you offered me before .
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s too late for that .
donna , i &apos;m drowning .
this whole thing with the slattery deal is--
i &apos;m sorry about your deal , harvey ,
but you should have thought about that before you turned me down .
so you &apos;re punishing me ?
i &apos;m not punishing you .
but i have a mountain of work , and even if i didn &apos;t ,
how do you think louis would feel if i suddenly
started working for you again ?
i don &apos;t give a shit how louis feels .
well , what about how i feel ?
which is that you &apos;re trying to undermine my decision .
how the hell am i trying to undermine your decision ?
what do you call this ?
that--that was before--
before what ? before you ran into louis ?
before you needed my help ? what ?
donna--
do you know where i found this ?
louis put it right on top of the list of secretaries
that i have been keeping for you because i still care about you ,
and you know what they both did ?
they fed right into his nightmare
that i &apos;m gonna leave him ,
which is exactly what you wanted .
do you know how hard it is for me
to swallow my pride and come over here ?
do you know how hard it is for me to say no to you ?
then don &apos;t .
i am asking you for one little thing .
no , harvey , it &apos;s not one little thing .
today it &apos;s the slattery deal ,
tomorrow &apos;s the weiss merger ,
and then the day after that ,
it will be a million other things
until you think everything is back to normal .
well , it &apos;s not . this is the new normal .
this is my desk now , and i wish i could help you , but i can &apos;t .
donna , please .
i &apos;m sorry , harvey , you &apos;re on your own .
and that &apos;s when it happened , isn &apos;t it ?
you had another one .
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
step one to making them stop is talking about it .
i couldn &apos;t think , i couldn &apos;t see , i c--
i couldn &apos;t breath .
and what did you do ?
you know what i did .
no , i know . i need you to say it .
why ?
&apos;cause the more you say it , the less power it has over you .
i made my way into the bathroom ,
and my heart was p @-@ pounding , and
my chest cracked open .
it was--it was like i was under water .
i looked at the stall , and there was ... two shoes there ,
a piece @-@ of @-@ shit brown shoe , untied , two guys laugh--
yeah , and then ?
i ran to the stall , i threw up ,
and i just waited until it was over .
and that &apos;s the night you came to see me .
yeah .
and you made up a story about having trouble sleeping
to get antianxiety medication ,
and you &apos;ve been taking a pill a day since .
yes .
busy .
louis ...
i &apos;m not leaving you .
it says , &quot; replacements for louis &quot;
right here on top , &quot; replacements for louis . &quot;
that &apos;s because that &apos;s the list i made after norma died .
then why do you still have it ?
because i was saving it for harvey .
this is for harvey ?
yes , louis , because i work for you now ,
and i &apos;d like to tell you to stop questioning
whether i &apos;m gonna change my mind ,
but we both know that &apos;s never gonna happen ,
so instead , i &apos;ll say ...
you need to talk to me about it when it does .
but i did talk to you , donna .
first , i loaded you up with work , then i yelled at you ,
and then i put the can @-@ opener on top of that list .
i mean , i can &apos;t be more direct than that .
yes , you can , louis .
because i don &apos;t want that kind of relationship anymore .
what &apos;s it for ?
what &apos;s what for ?
the can opener .
it &apos;s just a can opener , louis .
no , it &apos;s not .
harvey was sending me a message when he gave it to me .
that message wasn &apos;t meant for you .
it was meant for me .
donna , you want me to talk to you ,
but now you &apos;re not talking to me .
it was a ritual that harvey and i would do
before we went to trial .
so the message was ,
donna , you &apos;ll never have something like that with me .
no , louis , that &apos;s not what--
we should have a ritual .
let &apos;s worry about that after we win our first big case .
i was just about to offer you one of those .
jessica , if you &apos;re here to yell at me again--
i &apos;m not here to yell at you .
i &apos;m here to apologize to you .
then you can have a drink .
the truth is , there &apos;s a time for yelling
and there is a time for understanding ,
and a good partner knows the difference .
you mean a good managing partner .
no , i mean a good partner .
the night you found out donna was in trouble ,
the first thing you did was take the time ...
to have a drink with me about jeff .
so the least i could do is take the time
and understand your situation .
you mean , the fact that i don &apos;t have a secretary .
i mean that after 12 years , the woman you wouldn &apos;t
come work here without is now working for someone else .
and you want to know why .
i don &apos;t need to know why .
i need to know if you want me to undo it .
what ?
i know you and donna aren &apos;t me and jeff ,
but you are as close as two people can be
without being that .
shit , harvey , scottie leaving
didn &apos;t throw you off your game this much .
i appreciate the offer .
but as long as donna wants to work for louis ,
i am not gonna force her to work for me .
okay .
harvey , have you thought about
what &apos;s going to happen if she doesn &apos;t come back ?
she will .
wow .
wow what ?
this jessica sounds like a hell of a woman .
what does that have to do with anything ?
no , it doesn &apos;t . i @-@ i was just--
look , i don &apos;t care what you were doing .
we &apos;ve been here long enough .
hmm , we have .
but i &apos;m not gonna give you another prescription .
you said if i opened up--
i said if you didn &apos;t , i wouldn &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t say if you did , i would .
they &apos;re not the same thing .
goddamn it .
hold on , you didn &apos;t let me finish .
i &apos;m not gonna write you another prescription .
i &apos;m gonna give you these .
that &apos;s enough for another week .
you want me to come in here again .
mm , i sure do .
or you can roll the dice and spread them out ,
but you &apos;re not getting anymore without seeing me again .
one more thing .
these episodes are gonna keep happening
until you accept the fact that donna may never come back .
where the hell have you been all morning ?
what are you , my mother ?
i was at a meeting . why ?
remember when you said katzen was gonna
wait till the last second to hold us over a barrel ?
well , they didn &apos;t . they sold all of their debt
to kevin slattery &apos;s biggest competitor .
they &apos;re gonna want to put us in the ground for good .
well , then it &apos;s a good thing i figured out a way
to convince &apos; em not to .
what the hell are we still doing here ?
you tell me .
what the hell happened ?
atlantic freight is my chief rival .
if they call in the debt ,
they &apos;ll force me into bankruptcy .
if they call in the debt .
what is he talking about ?
he &apos;s talking about the fact that we just came from a meeting with them ,
and you &apos;re right .
they &apos;d love nothing more than to put you down
once and for all .
goddamn it .
but lucky for you , we told them
that if they force you into bankruptcy ,
that doesn &apos;t necessarily kill your company ,
but buying your name does .
so they own me ? that &apos;s your brilliant solution ?
no , they own the slattery trademark ,
which they think effectively puts you under ,
but they don &apos;t know what we know .
and what is that ?
that you have another contract
that doesn &apos;t care about the name of your company .
they only care about the name of the owner .
how the hell did katzen even know to sell their debt ?
because i made a mistake .
you sure as hell did !
after asking for 20 % of my company
and bragging that you could save it .
well , it turns out it , you &apos;re just an arrogant mouthpiece
that thinks he can save anything .
but you can &apos;t .
kevin , nobody hates change more than i do ,
but it &apos;s coming whether we like it or not .
and if i could save both your company and your name ,
i would , but you &apos;re right , i can &apos;t .
so take the deal , wake up tomorrow , and go to work .
hey , harvey ?
yeah .
i just want to say thanks ...
for not throwing us under the bus back there .
what do you mean ?
well , i mean , you could have told kevin slattery the truth .
that mistake was mine and rachel &apos;s .
no it wasn &apos;t .
you were right , that mistake was mine .
hey . what are you doing here so late ?
you didn &apos;t hear ?
we closed the davis brothers .
that &apos;s huge .
it is .
so i thought maybe this was the perfect time
to start our ritual .
oh , donna , listen , i &apos;ve been thinking .
i don &apos;t think we need to have a ritual .
come on . it &apos;s our first big win .
that &apos;s the same exact cake i got mike .
i know .
how did you know ?
i &apos;m donna .
you sure are .
what flavor is it ?
well , i called esther , and she said
german chocolate was your favorite .
i hate german chocolate .
which is why i got you mocha fudge .
it &apos;s perfect .
what can i do for you , harvey ?
i just wanted to see if you still had that list .
of course i do .
what &apos;s this ?
your engagement present .
come on , rachel , how long did you think
you could keep that glow a secret ?
i &apos;m glowing ?
like times square on new year &apos;s eve .
to me .
the rest of the world can &apos;t even see you
under that pile of work you took on to help harvey .
you knew about that too ?
of course i did ,
which is why you &apos;re getting this .
donna , you didn &apos;t have to--
i didn &apos;t , but harvey did .
and he won &apos;t think to get you two a gift ,
&apos;cause i was always the one
who took care of things like that , so ...
i don &apos;t know what to say .
say thank you .
thank you .
and promise me ,
no matter what is going on in my life ,
you won &apos;t feel bad about telling me all the good things in yours .
i promise .
what is this ?
a copy of brides magazine .
why is it on my desk ?
how else are you gonna pick your colors ?
colors ?
what are colors ?
how do you know what they are ?
because i &apos;m a grown man .
really ? &apos; cause you sound more like a grown woman .
that &apos;s very hurtful .
i looked everywhere for that issue .
thanks , harvey .
thank me on the way .
where are we going ?
to do what we should have done the day you got engaged .
nets game .
are you kidding ?
front row .
holy shit .
is jay @-@ z gonna be there ?
yeah , right next to me .
next to you ? wait , this my gift , hey ?
i don &apos;t care whose gift it is . i &apos;m not doing that to jay @-@ z.
oh , you know what , i &apos;ll just sit next to beyonc .
we &apos;ll call it a draw .
you know what , never mind .
i &apos;m taking rachel .
yeah , well , why don &apos;t you just give it to both of us ?
oh , wait , then who would stay here and do all your work ?
shit . was that too soon ?
oh , i &apos;m so sorry , bud . let &apos;s go !
