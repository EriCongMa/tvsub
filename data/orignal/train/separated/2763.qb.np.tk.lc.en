she &apos;ll love it .
thank you .

go with the egg , my friend .
go , go , go !
think it &apos;ll work ?
no way . it &apos;s suicide .
the one with the candy hearts
you can &apos;t do this .
do what ?
roger wants to take her out .
no ! remember why you dumped him ?
because he was creepy .
and mean . and frightening .
still , it &apos;s nice to have a date on valentine &apos;s day !
you can go out with a creep any night .
i know i do .
what are you doing tomorrow night ?
that depends on how tonight goes .
about tonight
don &apos;t you bail on me !
i said i &apos;d bring a friend for her friend .
but her friend sounds like a
pathetic mess . i know , but ....
come on . she &apos;s needy , vulnerable .
i &apos;m thinking ....
thanks .
you haven &apos;t been out with a woman since janice . you &apos;re doing this .
she said yes .
way to go , man !

can you stop yelling ? you &apos;re making me nervous and ....
i can &apos;t go when i &apos;m nervous .
i &apos;m sorry , you &apos;re right .
come on ! do it , do it !
roger was creepy , but he was nothing compared to pete .
who ?
pete the weeper .
the guy that used to cry every time we had sex ?
&quot; was it good for you ? &quot;
i &apos;d take crying any day over howard , the &quot; i win &quot; guy !
&quot; i win ! i win ! &quot;
we went out for two months . i didn &apos;t win once .
how do we end up with these jerks ?
we &apos;re some kind of magnets .
i know i am . that &apos;s why i can &apos;t wear a digital watch .
there &apos;s more beer , right ?
you know my friend who shaves her head ?
no .
i have this friend who shaves her head .
she says to break the bad boyfriend cycle ...
... you can do a cleansing ritual .
pheebs , this woman is voluntarily bald .
yeah .
we can do it tomorrow night .
it &apos;s valentine &apos;s day . it &apos;s perfect .
okay , what kind of ritual ?
we can burn the stuff they gave us .
or ... ?
or we can chant and dance around naked with sticks .
burning &apos;s good .
you know ...
... i can pick up quarters with my toes .
yeah ? good for you .
quarters or rolls of quarters ?
by the way , i cut you out of all of my pictures .
so if you want , i have a bag with just your heads .
that &apos;s okay .
you could make little puppets out of them .
and you could use them in your theater of cruelty !
we can &apos;t do that !
what ? what can &apos;t you do ?
can i talk to you for a second ? over there ?
we might be leaving now .
tell me it &apos;s you and me &quot; we . &quot;
she wants to slather my body with stuff and lick it off .
i &apos;m not even sure what slathering is !
but i definitely want to be a part of it !
okay , you cannot do this to me .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
can we have three chocolate mousses to go ?
i &apos;m out of here .
here &apos;s my credit card . dinner &apos;s on me .
i hope she throws up on you .

excuse me .
how you doing ?
so do we have the best friends , or what ?
joey &apos;s not a friend . he &apos;s ...

ross , there &apos;s someone i want you to say hi to .
he happened to call .
hi , ross . that &apos;s right , it &apos;s me ! how did you know ?
so , if dogs experience jet lag ...
... because of the seven dog years to one human year thing ...
... when a dog flies from new york to los angeles ...

that &apos;s funny !
they should be cooking the food soon .
oh , good .
who are they ?
the blond is my ex @-@ wife . the woman touching her is her ...
... close , personal friend .
they &apos;re lovers ?
lf you want to put a label on it .
anything else i should know ?
nope . that &apos;s it .
oh , and she &apos;s pregnant with my baby .
i always forget that part .
now we need sage branches and the sacramental wine .
all i had is oregano and a fresca .
that &apos;s okay !
now we need the semen of a righteous man .
if we had that , we wouldn &apos;t be doing the ritual in the first place .
can we start throwing things in ?
yeah , okay !
okay . barry &apos;s letters .
adam ritter &apos;s boxer shorts .
and i have the receipt from my dinner with ....

if you don &apos;t do it , i will .
so are you actually from new york ?
not originally . i &apos;m from
you said they &apos;d shoot it without you .
i thought they could .
the maxi @-@ pads were a piece of cake . mini @-@ pads should be that much easier .
it &apos;s valentine &apos;s day .
i know , but it &apos;s my job .
i &apos;ll try to get back as soon as i can .
i &apos;m spending most of my time teaching science ...
... which is funny because that wasn &apos;t even my major .
now , that is funny !
do you think it would be too weird if i invited carol over to join us ?
because she &apos;s alone now . and pregnant . and sad .
i guess .
are you sure ? carol !

thanks for coming over .
not at all . it &apos;s pretty much our job .
that &apos;s why we get the cool hats .
what do we got there ?
a piece of sik boxer shorts .
some greeting cards .
a half @-@ charred picture of ....
that guy &apos;s hairier than the chief !
it &apos;s a really funny story how this happened .
i was taking out the trash , and phoebe was burning incense
it &apos;s all right .
this isn &apos;t the first boyfriend bonfire we &apos;ve seen get out of control .
third one tonight .
really ?
valentine &apos;s is our busiest night of the year .
next time you &apos;re burning your ex @-@ boyfriend &apos;s stuff :
one , do it in a well @-@ ventilated area .
two , if you wanna burn his clothing , stay away from synthetic fabrics .
three , try to let go of the anger , and learn to love yourself .
i brought you something .
ls it loaded ?
oh , little candy hearts . &quot; chan and jan forever . &quot;
i had them made special .
okay , janice .
hey , janice .
there &apos;s no way to tell you this .
at least , there &apos;s no new way .
i just don &apos;t think things are gonna work out .
that &apos;s fine .
it is ?
because i know that this isn &apos;t the end .
you see , actually , it is .
no , because you won &apos;t let that happen .
don &apos;t you know it yet ?
you love me , chandler bing !
oh , no , i don &apos;t .
why do we keep ending up together ? new year &apos;s , who invited who ?
valentine &apos;s , who asked who into bed ?
i did , but
you seek me out !
something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn !
janice ! janice !
you push me away , you pull me back !
you want me . you need me .
you can &apos;t live without me . and you know it .
you just don &apos;t know you know it .
see ?
call me !
it &apos;s not true . i never called your mother a wolverine .
you did so , i swear to
how long has she been in the bathroom ?
she isn &apos;t in the bathroom . her coat &apos;s gone .
well , maybe it &apos;s cold in there .
i screwed up my first date in nine years .
that could be it .
oh , god .
you know , this is still pretty hot .
mushroom .
smile .
they won &apos;t all be like this . some might stay through dinner .
i &apos;m sorry . that &apos;s not funny .
it &apos;s just ....
you know the whole &quot; get on with your life &quot; thing ?
well , do i have to ?
i &apos;m sitting here with this cute woman ...
... and she &apos;s perfectly nice , but that ...
... that &apos;s it .
then i &apos;m here talking to you , and it &apos;s easy and it &apos;s fun .
and i don &apos;t have to ....
i know .
you know ?
here &apos;s a wacky thought .
let &apos;s say you and i give it another shot .
i know what you &apos;re gonna say . you &apos;re a lesbian .
but what do you say we just put that aside for now .
let &apos;s just stick a pin in it .
because we &apos;re great together . you can &apos;t deny it .
i &apos;ve got a ring at home that fits you .
i &apos;ve got lots of pictures with both of us in them .
and best of all , you &apos;re carrying my baby .
i mean , how perfect is that ?
ross
you keep saying that , but there &apos;s something right here . i love you .
i love you too .
but
no &quot; but . &quot;
you know that thing we put over here with the pin in it ?
it &apos;s time to take the pin out .
you &apos;ll find someone . the right woman is waiting for you .
it &apos;s easy for you to say . you found one already .
all you need is a woman who likes men , and you &apos;ll be set .
not her .
so , you guys really slide down a pole ?
absolutely .
that &apos;s so cool .
how do you get back up ?
well , we rarely have to return from a fire as quickly .
so , would you guys ....
would you like to , sometime , maybe ....
go for a drink sometime ?
sure , sounds good .
we get off at midnight . we &apos;ll pick you up then .
okay . great !
so will you bring the truck ?
i &apos;ll even let you ring the bell .
we &apos;ll see you later .
bye ! see you later !
oh , my god !
see ? there you go . the cleansing worked .
you &apos;re right . they &apos;re nice guys !
they &apos;re firemen guys !
