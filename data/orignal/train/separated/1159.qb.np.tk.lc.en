your panels came back with high levels of hgh .
human growth hormone ?
emily , if you &apos;re using a performance @-@ enhancing drug ,
it &apos;s going to show up in your tests .
can i just say how nice this is--
reaching for your hand
and not worrying about who might be watching us .
sorry to interrupt , but it &apos;s about mike .
how was the dinner party ?
it was fine , till the cops showed up to let us know that our son
had been arrested for breaking and entering .
save the date . they &apos;re getting married in six weeks .
i just spoke to your father again .
he wants you to talk to isabel .
i &apos;m not gonna be a bridesmaid .
what do you want from me ?
the truth .
what are you gonna give me ?
we &apos;ll make sure the video stays in a safe place .
should i be worried about you and this jason guy ?
no .
the truth is , i do care about you .
what is this place ?
it &apos;s jason &apos;s darkroom .
whose face is this ?
oh , my god , it &apos;s aria !
they &apos;re all aria !
why is your phone turned off ?
i was trying to reach you all night .
i &apos;m sorry . i was avoiding someone &apos;s call .
i need to talk to you about jason .
i need to talk to you about jason .
he kissed me .
aria !
i know , it was a mistake .
look , i was trying to figure out a way to tell you guys .
i totally don &apos;t know how to tell ezra .
do i even tell him ?
aria , jason had pictures of you . creepy pictures .
what ?
spencer and i found a darkroom in his woodshed .
he developed photographs of you sleeping ...
sleeping ? !
sleeping or drugged .
okay , well , i &apos;m officially terrified .
good . okay , it &apos;s about time .
and for the record , i never bought jason &apos;s whole act--
hanging around here , pretending to be concerned about at @-@ risk youth ,
using your brother to get to you .
hold on . he really did help mike .
so he could get in your house ...
... and kiss you !
wait ! what ?
you &apos;re kissing him now ?
no , he kissed me .
thanks , em , i really needed that , on top of everything else .
aria , he &apos;s dangerous .
fine .
fine . i gotta go .
did you know about this ?
i knew that they were ... connecting ,
but i promised i wouldn &apos;t say anything .
it &apos;s okay .
sometimes you have to hurt someone to help them .
the ceremony for the college fair will be held all day at the cafeteria .
so ... ready for the college fair ?
no , i &apos;m not staying .
i promised that i would pack up the rest of ian &apos;s stuff
before melissa gets home .
toby &apos;s gonna help me .
so it &apos;s a table for one .
sorry .
morning , sweetie . where &apos;s emily ?
she got up super early to go to swimming practice .
i thought she wasn &apos;t allowed to swim yet .
she &apos;s not . she sits by the pool ,
hoping someone will push her in .
she is not going to get any better doing what she &apos;s doing .
emily needs to heal , inside and out .
yeah , tell me about it .
she grinds her teeth in her sleep now .
it &apos;s like lying next to a buzz saw .
hanna , compassion .
i have it , just not in the morning .
if i could just ... find this ... thing .
here it is .
gift certificate ,
for a massage .
emily needs it more than i do . what do you think ?
all you ever gave me was a two @-@ for @-@ one at the donut hut .
which i appreciated ,
and i will give this to emily when i see her at school .
so ...
what did your father have to say ?
nothing much .
may i ?
&quot; dear hanna ,
i &apos;m so proud to call you my daughter .
to have you standing up there with me
is the best wedding gift i could imagine . &quot;
whatever .
the ceremony will only be , like , 20 minutes ,
so it &apos;s not that big of a deal .
it is a big deal .
it clearly means a lot to him that you &apos;re going .
i just think people make too much
out of weddings in general .
i mean , if it needs a tent , it &apos;s a circus .
says the girl who got up at four in the morning
to watch the royal wedding .
i had to pee .
for three hours ?
look , i know that you are thinking about me
and my feelings about all of this .
i love you for that .
but this is a day of happiness for your dad .
i want you to embrace that ,
in the same way that you would embrace it
if i found someone . okay ?
i &apos;ll try .
aren &apos;t you late for school ?
oh , it &apos;s college fair day . attendance is optional .
or not .
can i talk to you ?
hey , yeah , look . i wanted to talk to you .
why do you have those pictures of me ?
what ?
my friends said they found pictures
that you took of me sleeping .
how did you even take them ?
did you , like , climb a ladder up to my window ?
hold up . your friends are the ones who broke into my darkroom ?
so what ?
the point is , they found the photos--
photos you didn &apos;t want found .
man , i swear , this town never changes .
people would rather sneak behind your back
than ask you a direct question .
i &apos;m asking you a direct question right now--
why did you take them , and when ?
i didn &apos;t . ali did .
why would ali take pictures of me sleeping ?
got me . i don &apos;t know what goes on at slumber parties .
look , i found a roll of her film in the house , so i developed it .
okay , well , why were all the pictures missing
when my friends went back there ?
spencer said the whole darkroom was gone .
that equipment is expensive ,
so i moved it into the house until i could get a new lock .
and the prints were gone because i was having them framed .
as a gift . for you .
so ...
anything else you want to accuse me of ?
jason , you have to admit ,
this all looks really bad .
yeah .
i can see that .
anne ?
what brings you here today ?
i have a meeting with your principal .
an upcoming presentation .
how &apos;s aria ?
better , i think . thank you .
actually , i was wondering if i could talk to you
about my son , mike .
oh , okay .
he goes to school here . he &apos;s 14,
and he &apos;s just become very withdrawn--
doesn &apos;t want to go to school ,
he doesn &apos;t really come out of his room .
and he was caught breaking into a house .
did he talk to you about it ?
no , he won &apos;t talk to anybody ,
but i was hoping that he might talk to you .
well , i don &apos;t usually recommend
that siblings see the same therapist ,
but why don &apos;t i come up with a few people
who might be right for him ?
shall we get the other box from your car ?
actually , i was just thinking
we could put one down here ,
let the kids scavenge through them
like hungry pigeons .
well , you know the student body better than i do .
here .
i &apos;ll help you .
em . hey .
i wanted to give you this before i leave .
leave ? aren &apos;t we checking out booths together ?
no , you know what ? i just had to go to that stupid fitting
for my bridesmaid &apos;s dress .
what &apos;s this ?
a free massage .
my mom says you need to relax .
i am relaxed .
you can &apos;t even turn your head . use it .
anyways , i gotta go . mona &apos;s waiting for me outside .
oh , my god , that was hilarious !
i know !
are we hanging out at my house before the meet ?
i don &apos;t know . i haven &apos;t another choice .
i &apos;m there .
me too . what time ?
nine . bring breakfast . or cupcakes !
emily ?
thank you .
no problem .
everything all right ?
no .
can i help ?
i know what you &apos;re thinking .
that i couldn &apos;t possibly understand the problems
you &apos;re dealing with right now ,
but i might surprise you if you give me a chance .
just because you stopped being my patient
doesn &apos;t mean i stopped caring about you .
there are things that we ... i ...
haven &apos;t told you .
and i need to .
why don &apos;t we do this in my office ?
do you have any time after school today ?
yeah .
so , this is weird , huh ?
boxing up someone &apos;s life .
this is ian we &apos;re talking about .
i think this just became my fondest memory of him .
so , i know why i &apos;m not going to the college fair .
why aren &apos;t you there ?
&apos;cause i went last year .
you &apos;ve probably been going since middle school , right ?
well , you know the hastings motto--
&quot; why enjoy today when you could be worrying about tomorrow ? &quot;
hey , check this out .
ian &apos;s old yearbook .
wait , stop . there he is .
&quot; captain of the lacrosse team .
honors society . drama club . &quot;
yeah , he was quite the actor .
&quot; n.a.t. club &quot; ? what &apos;s that ?
never heard of it .
yeah , neither have i , and i know every club .
i came close to joining the madrigals !
let-- let me see this .
it &apos;s not in the index of clubs .
so maybe it was some kind of mistake .
okay , then , how do you explain that ?
&quot; ian-- n.a.t. forever . jason . &quot;
dilaurentis ?
&quot; jason dilaurentis . n.a.t. club . &quot;
spenc-- spencer , what is it ?
i just want to see if anyone else was a member .
garrett reynolds .
n.a.t. club .
wha-- ? ms. montgomery !
have you considered hollis college ?
they have a wonderful arts program ,
and i think you &apos;ll find the teachers are very hands @-@ on ,
and ...
aria ?
aria , wait .
what &apos;s up ? are you mad at me ?
no , i &apos;m not mad at you .
i &apos;m worried about us .
i just feel like outside forces are kind of taking over .
forces ?
people .
aria , i don &apos;t know what else to tell you
to prove that jackie &apos;s not a threat .
you know what ? you wouldn &apos;t know a threat if it sat in your lap
and made you a gin and tonic !
what does that even mean ?
it means that jackie is interested in you .
she flirts with you every single day .
i @-@ i just saw .
aria , i work with the woman .
look , i &apos;m not blaming her .
okay , it &apos;s not her fault .
we &apos;ve left ourselves open to that
because she doesn &apos;t know that you &apos;re in a relationship--
the same way that no one knows that i &apos;m in a relationship .
yeah , but it &apos;s not a problem
as long as we know .
i meant it when i said i didn &apos;t have feelings for her .
well , i meant it when i said i didn &apos;t have feelings for jason ,
but that didn &apos;t stop me from kissing him .
wait . that-- that came out entirely wrong .
i didn &apos;t kiss him ; he kissed me .
i just ... i didn &apos;t stop him .
hey , e @-@ z ,
can you get those last box of brochures out of the car ?
i don &apos;t want to leave the booth .
yeah . sure .
college will be a great experience for you .
it really helps you grow up .
really ?
you &apos;ll look back and realize just how naive you were .
so , what do you think ?
hold on . let me stop dry @-@ heaving first .
okay , it &apos;s not that bad .
kate moss would look like a water buffalo in that .
all you &apos;re missing is cud .
i don &apos;t know . i mean , if i tighten the waist
and shorten it a bit ,
i think it would actually be really cute .
seriously ? who is this hillbilly your dad is marrying ?
her name is isabel , and can you ease up ?
so her taste is a little more classic .
yeah-- classic ugly .
and you know that .
so why are you channeling pollyanna ?
polly who ?
okay , you know , it &apos;s important to my dad ,
and , i don &apos;t know , i wasn &apos;t exactly a charmer
the first time i met kate and isabel ,
and i need to make it up to them .
so if that means i &apos;m standing up there
looking like sasquatch ,
then so be it .
fine , i get it .
be nice to her if you have to , but let &apos;s face it--
your stepmom @-@ to @-@ be is a jug @-@ blowing hayseed ,
and so is her daughter kate .
hanna ?
kate ! oh , hi .
i wish i had known you were coming for a fitting .
my mom just left .
we all could have tried on our dresses together .
that &apos;s too bad . that would have been really fun .
oh , my god !
is that the new rebecca minkoff ?
i thought they were , like , totally sold out .
they are .
um , kate , this is my friend mona .
hi . pleasure .
so , what are the chances of me running into you today ?
like , one in a million ? why aren &apos;t you at school ?
exams . all my classes are ap ,
so i took mine early . how about you ?
uh , college fair .
but i &apos;m gonna pick out my college the same way i pick out my clothes--
from my catalog .
that &apos;s funny .
uh , listen , um , my older cousins and i
are meeting later at a club for some lunch .
why don &apos;t both of you join us ?
oh , we can &apos;t .
oh , i &apos;m starved !
great . i &apos;m gonna go write down the directions ,
and i will be back in a sec .
what are you doing ? you are not starved !
you just had a whole bowl of jellybeans .
they were complimentary .
we &apos;re not going .
yes , we are !
you said you needed to make nice with her .
now &apos;s your chance .
so , take your time and get comfortable .
you can lie facedown between the sheets
when you &apos;re ready .
sure .
first time ?
that obvious , huh ?
trust me , you &apos;ll love it .
you let me know if the pressure &apos;s right .
we &apos;ll start easy and see where you &apos;re tender .
i &apos;ll be back in a few minutes , okay ?
okay .
i just checked a bunch of old yearbooks .
that club isn &apos;t mentioned in any of them .
i checked too . it must be some kind of prank .
what , like seniors get away with murder ?
there &apos;s got to be an answer in all of this stuff .
i mean , jason , ian , and garrett ?
&quot; n.a.t. club &quot; ?
it &apos;s got to mean something !
what &apos;s a nice way to say someone &apos;s obsessive ?
wait a minute . check this out .
nos animadverto totus .
&quot; n.a.t. &quot;
you took latin , right ?
yeah , and i got a five on my ap ,
but i don &apos;t remember any of it .
尽收眼底
&quot; we see all . &quot;
&quot; we see all . &quot;
wait . we know that ian liked to secretly videotape
the girls of rosewood , right ?
uh ... yeah .
well , what if &quot; we see all &quot;
means that jason and garrett were in
on his dirty little game ?
but what would that mean ,
other than that they were perverts ?
it means that maybe jason killed alison
for the same reason we thought ian did :
to get back those tapes .
mind if i sit down ?
oh , come on , you &apos;re not still scared of me , are you ?
okay , are we eating hay ? because i was promised lunch .
so the plan changed .
yeah , because you had to open your big mouth
and mention your amazing summer at equestrian camp--
which , by the way , was news to me .
okay , how was i supposed to know that kate
would offer to take us riding ?
anyways , this &apos;ll be fun !
plus , okay , how much are you loving these outfits ?
i don &apos;t know .
these jodhpurs are cutting off my circulation .
i &apos;m over here ! can you grab those helmets ?
yeah . sure thing .
who &apos;s elizabeth ?
i am .
you can call her bitsy .
so , you must be &quot; marg @-@ ox . &quot;
it &apos;s margeaux . the &quot; x &quot; is silent .
so , hanna , have you ridden english before ?
oh , no , i &apos;m still learning american .
you mean western .
what ?
hanna , you &apos;re too much !
oh . ready ?
you bet .
whoa . this thing is , uh ...
bigger than i thought .
like , extinct animal big .
if you don &apos;t feel comfortable riding ,
we can always hang out another time .
oh , she &apos;ll be fine .
why don &apos;t you girls go on ahead
and we &apos;ll join you . i &apos;ll show hanna the ropes .
all right . are you sure ?
seriously , i &apos;m like the horse whisperer .
okay .
that feels great .
these are beautiful .
yeah .
i didn &apos;t know ali was so artistic .
i barely remember her even taking pictures .
it &apos;s ... strange .
still getting to know someone after they &apos;re gone .
nervous ?
it &apos;s a bad habit .
look , i know this ... isn &apos;t an excuse , but ...
my friends broke in because they &apos;ve been through a lot .
i think we &apos;re all looking for answers .
that &apos;s how i found this roll of film in the first place .
where did you find it ?
i was doing renovations in ali &apos;s room .
i pulled up her floorboard and found a box of her stuff .
what else was in the box ?
nothing special . girl stuff .
well ... then why would she hide it ?
i don &apos;t know .
hiding things became such second nature for her ,
i don &apos;t think she even knew why she was doing it half the time .
something becomes a habit , it &apos;s hard to stop , you know ?
so , um ... have you found anything else of hers ?
no . just the box .
you can take a look at it , if you want .
it &apos;s back at the house .
or you can just wait for the next break @-@ in
from your circle of friends and relatives .
should we go in there and talk to her ?
aria won &apos;t listen to anything else that i have to say about jason .
but i know who she will listen to .
huh ! can &apos;t be much further .
how &apos;s your ankle ?
that was so weird .
i &apos;ve never seen one bite before .
we lost kate &apos;s horses !
they &apos;ll find their way back . they &apos;re like big dogs .
i &apos;ve told you this before .
did you ever even go to riding camp ?
so i embellished a little bit .
look , hanna , the key to survival
of any species is adaptability .
whoa ! when there &apos;s a nuclear war ,
i guess it &apos;s going to be mona and a million cockroaches ,
because you even had me fooled .
why are you mad ?
the only reason i &apos;m even here is for you .
i &apos;ve been working it all day
to help you get in good with these girls .
who are you trying to help here-- me or yourself ?
what is that supposed to mean ?
i just couldn &apos;t help but notice that once you found out
kate was more country club than hillbilly ,
you couldn &apos;t wait to spend the day with her and her crew .
whatever .
i hope caleb comes back soon
&apos;cause ever since he left , you &apos;ve been a total crank .
ready to begin ?
what ?
my apologies . scheduling issue .
i &apos;ll tack on an extra 10 minutes .
wait . weren &apos;t you just in here ?
no .
someone was in here .
spencer , do you ... need a ride or something ?
i have to talk to you .
okay , there &apos;s something that i need to tell you ,
but ... before i tell you that , there &apos;s ...
there &apos;s something else that i need to tell you .
okay .
i know about you and aria .
excuse me ?
ezra , you don &apos;t--
i &apos;m sorry . mr. fitz .
better . thank you .
just listen to me .
aria &apos;s in danger .
呼叫 取消
uh ... actually , the box is in the woodshed .
follow me .
you coming ?
um ... no , no .
i &apos;ll just wait out here for you .
okay . i &apos;ll be back in a sec .
what a complete waste of time !
i &apos;m sorry i snapped at you .
you didn &apos;t do anything wrong . it &apos;s just ...
kate and her friends think i &apos;m totally clueless .
that &apos;s not true .
yes , it is .
every time i looked back at them ,
i got the stink @-@ eye from itsy .
bitsy .
whatever .
they both hated me .
hanna ...
maybe you &apos;re just not trying hard enough .
what ?
mona , how could you say that ?
i practically killed myself today
trying to make those girls like me .
why should i even try at all ?
if it weren &apos;t for &quot; isa @-@ hell &quot; the skank ,
my mom would be with my dad right now instead of home alone ,
so kate , her mom , and those little bitches
can go to hell , for all i care .
hanna ...
kate .
no , kate , wait .
what are you doing here ?
your mother let me in .
i thought we had an agreement ,
but you don &apos;t seem to care ...
about that anymore .
what are you talking about ?
ian &apos;s dead .
alison &apos;s murder has been solved ,
but you &apos;re still digging--
digging like the hungry terrier you always reminded me of .
great . i got it .
now , why don &apos;t you leave ?
i know toby &apos;s helping you .
i know he was going through my room .
you need to stop .
what you &apos;re doing is dangerous for you
and for toby .
you expect me to believe that you care about toby ?
i do care about him .
right . well , i know all about that , remember ?
well . i guess i &apos;ve said all i have to say .
thanks for stopping by .
and tell garrett i said hi .
what are you doing here ?
i came to get you .
spencer thought after you left the grille ...
spencer ? you talked to spencer ?
she talked to me , and she admitted that she knew about us .
she told you about us ? why would she do that ?
because your friends think this guy jason is dangerous ,
and i do too . they told me about the photos .
he had a legitimate explanation for the photos .
look , you don &apos;t have to worry . he &apos;s not a threat .
he is to me .
i don &apos;t want to lose you .
look ... we started out hiding this relationship
so we could have one ,
but if keeping it a secret is destroying it ,
then i don &apos;t want to keep it a secret anymore .
so , what are you saying ?
it &apos;s time to tell people about us ,
and i think we should start by telling your parents .
you want to start with my parents ?
yeah . i &apos;d rather they heard it from us .
i &apos;ll be right back .
okay .
you &apos;re giving this to me ?
yeah .
thanks .
so , i should ...
yeah . i know . you &apos;re unavailable .
she knows about us .
they know about us , and she &apos;s looking at yearbooks .
it &apos;s only a matter of time before they figure it out ,
if they haven &apos;t already .
what do you want me to do ?
it &apos;s time to talk to jason .
did dad call ?
i don &apos;t think so , but i just got home .
how was the college fair ?
i left early to try on the bridesmaid &apos;s dress .
oh , yeah ? how was it ?
not a great fit .
hello ?
hey , tom .
no ...
i didn &apos;t know that .
i &apos;m glad it went well .
i &apos;m sure she would love to talk to her .
kate &apos;s coming to the phone .
hanna ?
thank you so much for not saying anything .
i am so sorry ...
don &apos;t apologize .
we &apos;re practically family now .
i @-@ i just ...
actually ...
i &apos;m sorry about what happened to your horse .
oh . yeah , that &apos;s okay .
you know , training a horse is an art .
you have to work with the animal ,
bending its will until it knows you &apos;re its master ,
taking all the fight out of it
until it truly is broken .
that &apos;s how you &apos;re going to feel when i &apos;m through with you .
welcome to the family ...
sis .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a box of ali &apos;s things .
jason found it . he gave it to me .
what &apos;s in it ?
oh , as it turns out , it &apos;s just ...
a whole bunch of nothing .
what &apos;s up ?
oh , i talked to dr. sullivan today , about mike ,
and i made an appointment for him to see
somebody she suggested .
oh . good .
you liked going to see someone , right ?
yeah .
obviously , i wasn &apos;t very thrilled about going in the first place ,
but ... yeah , i actually started to look forward to it .
can you tell mike that ? &apos; cause he does not want to go .
sure .
i &apos;ll talk to him . i don &apos;t really know if he &apos;ll listen to me .
well , don &apos;t let that stop you .
i never do .
and could you maybe possibly tell him
how seeing a therapist doesn &apos;t make him a total loser ?
mom . i &apos;m on it .
okay .
i just ... i think he needs this .
yeah .
actually , there was , um , one other thing .
i feel kind of strange even bringing it up ,
but , um ...
earlier this year , there were some rumors
about mr. fitz
being involved with a student .
yeah .
and i just assumed it was gossip
because he was young ,
and clearly a lot of students
were nursing a crush on him .
but maybe i shouldn &apos;t have .
shouldn &apos;t have what ?
assumed it wasn &apos;t true .
is there something you want to tell me about mr. fitz ...
... and spencer ?
what ?
are mr. fitz and spencer ...
involved ?
what ? no ! why would you even think that ?
because i saw them talking in his car ,
and it seemed ... intimate .
well , they &apos;re not ... intimate .
but would it be so bad if they were , though ?
you said so yourself-- there &apos;s barely any age difference .
yeah , but , i mean , that &apos; s not the point .
he was her teacher , and if i found out
he abused his power like that , i &apos;d be ...
really disappointed .
yeah .
well ...
there &apos;s-- there &apos;s nothing going on between them , so ...
good .
you know , i take that back .
i &apos;d feel more than disappointed .
i &apos;d feel betrayed .
here .
small sips .
you know what the worst part is ?
if i had just looked up during that massage ,
we &apos;d know who &quot; a &quot; is .
what did the hands feel like , a guy or a girl ?
i @-@ i thought like a girl , but ...
now i don &apos;t know .
do you need to take another shower ?
no , i think five is enough .
i could use one .
i &apos;ve felt gross ever since i discovered
ian &apos;s video &apos;s might have had more than one cameraman !
that is so creepy .
what &apos;s even creepier is that one of those guys has a gun ,
and a badge .
and a relationship to jenna , who hates us ,
and hated ali even more .
so , which one is &quot; a &quot; ?
that &apos; s the thing-- ever since we realized
&quot; a &quot; made ian &apos;s death look like a suicide ,
we &apos;ve been thinking that &quot; a &quot; and the killer are the same person .
what if &quot; a &quot; is a group of people ,
all playing together for the same team ?
or the same club .
that &apos;s probably aria ,
and my guess is she has something that she wants to say to me .
if i &apos;m not back in five minutes , send a rescue team .
it &apos;s nothing .
hey . how is she ?
she &apos;s ... shaken , but she &apos;s still standing .
what was i supposed to do ?
i &apos;m not mad at you .
really ?
yeah .
good , &apos; cause i just did it because i was nervous ,
and you &apos;re-- you &apos;re really tiny ,
and i love you .
i love you too .
and besides , you going to fitz ,
it actually turned out to be a good thing .
made him step up .
really ?
