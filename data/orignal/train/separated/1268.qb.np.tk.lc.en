i was afraid you wouldn &apos;t come back .
i got scared .
but you know what ?
maybe we &apos;ll get through this .
come on . what are you doing ?
i got it .
maura , w @-@ we should use plastic .
for a christening ?
it &apos;s sparkling cider . and t.j. doesn &apos;t care .
i care . it &apos;s my first grandchild .
tommy , you &apos;re helping us clean these .
why ?
&apos;cause he &apos;s your kid .
rondo ?
vanilla . look at those legs !
bro !
hey !
&quot; bro &quot; ?
man , i was on my way to a barbecue .
brought you something for your special day .
hey , little man , you being good ?

no . got a guy , got me a good deal .
looks real , don &apos;t it ?
have i just been transported to some parallel univer--
when did you two start a bromance ?
oh , we go way back .
yeah , we met at the cafe last week .
tom @-@ tom , have fun , my man .
all right . thanks .
hey , make sure his baby mama don &apos;t mess with him .
he &apos;s a good daddy .
what , is there something going on between lydia and tommy ?
hey , as long as they share custody
over a baby they made on their first date , i don &apos;t ask .
oh , frankie !
why did you leave this mess ?
jane , it &apos;s okay .
no , it &apos;s not .
i thought you were gonna restore it for your new undercover job .
oh , there &apos;s no point .
i &apos;m not exclusive to the drug unit anymore .
they made me a &quot; floating &quot; detective .
oh , cool .
yeah . i get to try out everything . look at this .
what --
&quot; bpd cuts to affect all detectives . &quot;
it won &apos;t happen .
might .
i have to &quot; float &quot;
until some department comes up with the funds .
um , everybody , we should go .
i got the baby . i got the baby !
well , this should be awkward .
because of lydia ?
no . that &apos;s the priest that tommy ran over in the crosswalk .
well , why didn &apos;t he choose another church ?
because ma said that we owed it to father crowley
to let him baptize the ... next generation of rizzolis .
you don &apos;t think he &apos;s still mad , do you ?
oh , why would he be mad ? you just broke both his legs .
hey , i spent three years in prison .
that &apos;s plenty of penance .
you didn &apos;t talk to him , did you ?
uh , i meant to ...
god , tommy . you see why he got all the attention ?
he needed it ?
father crowley ,
thank you so much for doing this .
the parish appreciates your kind donation , angela .
hello , thomas .
you do plan to raise this child in the catholic faith ?
uh ... sure . why not ?
it &apos;s the role of the mother and father
to present the child to the church .
and who are the parents ?
we are .
we are .
oh , uh , and me .
stuart !
everyone , this is stuart .
m @-@ my friends call me &quot; strawberry . &quot;
we are not your &quot; friends . &quot;
tommy .
mr. strawberry , we are in the middle of a service .
what is this guy doing at my son &apos;s christening ?
i invited him .
he has every right to be here .
what are you doing ?
something smells .
yeah , it &apos;s probably t.j. &apos; s diaper . stop .
no , i @-@ i &apos;m smelling something else .
yeah , somethin &apos; does stink .
tommy , we &apos;re in a church .
tell her . she &apos;s the one who brought her lover .
he &apos;s my fiance .
huh ? what ?
your what ?
wh-- you cannot go up there .
okay . father , if you would just baptize this -- this little guy ,
we &apos;ll -- we &apos;ll get out of your hair .
no . not with this guy here .
place the infant over the baptismal font .
what name do you wish to give your child ?
there are human remains in there .
strawbridge .
strawbridge ? over my dead body .
you sure ?
well , i can &apos;t be sure unless i take a look , but ...
in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit ,
i -- - what a lovely service .
thank you so much . we have to go .
come on . - okay , jane , we didn &apos;t even --
ma , that &apos;s a wrap .
frankie , can you help me get everybody out of here , please ?
uh , there &apos;s a potential biological hazard
in the baptismal font .
gotcha .
okay , everybody , come on . let &apos;s go .
i knew t.j. should &apos;ve been a methodist .
i should &apos;ve picked a better mom for him .
you didn &apos;t &quot; pick &quot; me .
we got drunk and did it in my car ,
and then you on passed me on to your father . remember ?
is that why i no longer see frank sr. at mass ?
is there any way that we could
just tell our little family stories outside , please ?
i &apos;m so sorry , father .
we &apos;re usually not like this .
okay , take it slow . it &apos;s heavy .
let &apos;s get it over here .
in the baptismal font ? is nothing sacred ?
it appears to be a young female .
she looks like old shoe leather .
okay , frost , go talk to father crowley .
ask him when the last time
the water in the basin was changed .
yeah , okay .
any idea what that white powder is ?
it has the odor and texture of agricultural lime .
ag @-@ lime . i use that in my garden .
you garden ? i didn &apos;t know that , sergeant .
what do you grow ?
well , let &apos;s see , i got tomatoes , basil , kitchen herbs .
i think i &apos;ll have a really good crop of green beans this year .
oh , you know , i had great luck with french beans .
okay , farmers .
let &apos;s work on the almanac later . all right ?
why would someone put ag @-@ lime on her ?
it accelerates desiccation and masks the odor .
huh . how was she killed ?
there are ligature marks .
so she was strangled .
well , i didn &apos;t say that .
i did .
well , how long has she been dead ?
well , the ag @-@ lime is gonna make it difficult
to determine post @-@ mortem interval .
it was poured on her within an hour of her death .
okay . that helps .
says to me that she was killed in the church .
it doesn &apos;t say that to me .
well , a murderer isn &apos;t going to strangle her
and then drag her all the way in here , dump her in there ,
then run all the way back out and get the ag @-@ lime .
bet we &apos;ll find ag @-@ lime on the grounds .
what did father crowley say ?
he said ... &quot; tommy rizzoli has always been trouble . &quot;
did he say when the church was locked ?
between midnight and 4 : 00 a.m.
who has keys ?
staff , janitors , gardeners , choir ,
and anybody who uses the meeting rooms .
and 500 other parishioners .
there &apos;s an awful lot of suspects .
if we have this ag @-@ lime anywhere ,
it would be in our shed .
thank you .
mateo .
good morning , father .
hope you like petunias .
we &apos;re replanting the flower beds .
yes , of course .
hello , samuel .
hello , father .
back from britmore so soon ?
actually , we &apos;re just back on break .
britmore . that &apos;s a really good college .
he &apos;s a hard worker .
getting straight a &apos;s .
dad .
father , is everything okay up at the church ?
i saw police .
do you use ag @-@ lime on the church grounds ?
yes .
where do you keep it ? i &apos;d like to see it .
sure .
sal , open the shed , would you ?
show them the ag @-@ lime ?
yeah , okay .
right there .
you keep the shed locked ?
no . it &apos;s a church .
who &apos;s going to steal from it ?
same person who &apos;s gonna murder in one .
i &apos;ll get a sample and have the crime lab
run it against the powder on the body .
thomas edward rizzoli , what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
eating cake .
come in .
yeah , why not ?
it &apos;s not a party without t.j.
did somebody say &quot; party &quot; ?
you people need party lessons .
i &apos;m screwed . she &apos;s got a new guy .
that little ho .
pardon me ?
sorry , mrs. vanilla .
by the way , how long has mr. strawberry fellow
been in the picture ?
i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re the father . it &apos;s your job to know .
what &apos;s it matter ?
stuart &apos;s gonna take him from me .
he can &apos;t , tommy .
unmarried fathers are entitled to the same rights .
yeah , you have a custody order .
there . you see ?
well , what if ... you , like , got the papers filled out
and you &apos;re about to file them ...
you didn &apos;t file the custody papers .
thomas !
oh !
i meant to .
like you &quot; meant to &quot;
put the parking brake on the cutlass ?
what happened with the cutlass ?
it rolled through mrs. sutter &apos;s garage
and blew apart her pool .
that above @-@ ground pool sucked , anyway .
wait . if you have no rights to t.j. ,
neither do i.
i gotta go to work .
that smell in the church was a dead body .
on our first family baptism ?
wait . wait . can you and jane fix this stuart thing ?
not everything &apos;s &quot; fixable . &quot;
unbelievable .
i i don &apos;t know what to do . do you ?
beat him senseless .
okay , maura , talk to me
and detective floater here about our victim .
well , she hasn &apos;t had dental work .
okay . so we can &apos;t i.d. her with dental records .
no . and her iliac crest is fused ,
but it &apos;s recent .
she &apos;s between the ages of 17 and 22 .
did you do a vaginal exam ?
yes . she wasn &apos;t raped .
where &apos;s the magnifying thingy ?
yeah .
thank you .
what do you make of those marks ?
marks from the ligature .
quite distinctive -- symmetrical and evenly spaced .
it &apos;s not from the locket she was wearing .
chain &apos;s too thin .
you think that little girl &apos;s our victim ?
hmm . it &apos;s possible .
similar bone structure .
okay , uh , we &apos;ll go out on a limb here .
the woman with her --
so dangerous to make wild leaps --
is it her babysitter ?
you &apos;re not going to make me say that it &apos;s her mother .
i think she just did .
uh , there &apos;s something dried on her pants .
mm . i &apos;ll have susie test it .
there &apos;s a receipt in her pocket .
for what ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s faded .
thermal paper doesn &apos;t use ink . fades immediately .
i &apos;ll have the crime lab look at it .
her shirt and her pants are both off @-@ 93 apparel .
that &apos;s a pretty common brand . i @-@ i can track it , though .
yeah , do that .
oh , a tattoo .
oh , the tissue is inflamed .
it was done within eight hours of her death .
it &apos;s homemade . whoever did it used a ballpoint pen .
maybe she just got out of prison
or it &apos;s a gang tattoo .
want me to track it through the gang tattoo database ?
considering it &apos;s the only tattoo database we &apos;ve have ,
yes , please .
i live to float .
i &apos;ll scan her prints ,
but i &apos;m not optimistic unless she was arrested .
even if she was a gang @-@ banger , she has a mother .
i think this is our victim . how old does she look to you ?
seven , maybe ?
did you run her prints ?
no hits .
i &apos;ll get an x @-@ ray of her skull from dr . isles
and use this photo and do a computer age progression .
i ran a check on the sexual offenders
that live near the church -- there &apos;s a half a dozen of them .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re looking for a sexual offender .
she wasn &apos;t raped .
is this everybody with keys to the church ?
or access to them , yeah .
any of these guys have a record ?
i &apos;ll call the vatican
and see what father crowley &apos;s been up to .
he &apos;s a good suspect .
he hates everybody , especially tommy .
how was the christening ?
oh , think of your worst family holiday ,
and multiply by ten .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , jane .
well , sal perez did five years for a string of b &amp; e &apos;s .
maybe our victim caught him stealing something from the church ?
yeah , check and see if anything &apos;s missing .
oh , frankie came by . no hits on that tattoo .
he seems to be taking the new assignment pretty well .
you think this budget @-@ cut story is accurate ?
i heard it could happen .
yeah , but they &apos;re not gonna make cuts in homicide , are they ?
i don &apos;t count on anything .
mayor white laid off 250 cops in the &apos; 80s .
i was out for a year .
you were a shorty pasquale pizza boy ?
i had to pay the rent .
i keep this to remind myself to be grateful .
all right , maura &apos;s got something .
evidence of two spiral fractures --
right radius and left ulna .
so , two people held her down and broke both her arms .
that &apos;s one possible scenario .
the fractures are small .
it happened within 24 hours of her death .
that &apos;s not enough , maura .
i need to know when she died .
ag @-@ lime made that impossible .
jane , if i can &apos;t narrow down the time of death ,
you certainly can &apos;t .
strawbridge , strawberry ...
are you doing what i think you &apos;re doing ?
how did you know i &apos;m looking at porn ?
no , wait ,
i logged in as you , so dr. isles is looking at porn .
oh . what ? ! move over .
oh , i guess it &apos;s all right to be looking up stuart .
he &apos;s a home wrecker . look .
&quot; a rocking farewell to strawberry .
don &apos;t forget all the little people
as you head to the big time
at big box &apos;s headquarters in abilene &quot; ?
&quot; my new family . &quot;
he &apos;s taking t.j. to abilene .
it &apos;ll be okay , ma .
yeah , strawberry &apos;s a stable guy .
he seems nice . he &apos;s got a job .
t.j. could do worse .
tommy couldn &apos;t even fill out his papers , jane .
yeah , but he loves t.j. , frankie . and so do we .
there &apos;s only one thing we can do .
please don &apos;t suggest kidnapping to two cops .
we need to get tommy and lydia back together .
okay , but they never were &quot; together . &quot;
tommy had a one @-@ night stand and then introduced lydia --
i don &apos;t care .
i will do whatever i have to do to get my grandbaby back ,
especially since neither one of you are making any .
ma !
ma .
i know tommy likes lydia .
what , did he tell you that ?
didn &apos;t have to . she likes him , too .
that &apos;s why they act like
7th @-@ graders when they &apos;re around each other .
are you sure that &apos;s not a brain problem ?
jane .
what ?
well , what if we got the two of them together --
i mean , in the same place .
well , so , what , we &apos;re in &quot; the parent trap &quot; now ?
oh , that &apos;s a great idea .
what -- what are you doing ?
frankie .
hey , lydia . it &apos;s frankie . jane asked me to call you .
no . uh @-@ huh .
well , she feels really bad
that she wasn &apos;t able to give t.j. his present .
present ? no , i didn &apos;t get him one yet !
no , she &apos;s gonna be stuck at work all day today , so ...
it would really mean a lot if you could come by .
great !
yeah , bye .
what the hell ? where am i gonna get a present ?
just get lydia to your apartment ,
and i &apos;ll get tommy there .
that &apos;s a genius idea !
that &apos;s a terrible idea .
what , you got a better one ?
no !
that doesn &apos;t look good .
what ?
i can &apos;t take any more bad news today .
it &apos;s a letter from the brass .
they &apos;re saying there might be layoffs .
what ?
we might be &quot; reallocated &quot; ? what does that mean ?
might put us back in uniform , add 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 calls to the job .
can they do that ?
yeah .
at least yours won &apos;t suggest you take early retirement .
what about me ? last man in , first man out .
detective frost ,
you did a really nice job on the age progression ,
i would just extend the nose a little bit
and take another pass on her ears .
all right .
what &apos;s wrong ? jane .
oh , nothing .
we can &apos;t identify a dead girl ,
my nephew is moving to texas with a strawberry ,
and i might have to wear my uniform to work .
oh . well , then , this won &apos;t help .
the crime lab wasn &apos;t able to restore anything on the receipt .
can i see it ? what did you try ?
uh , a dry iron and u.v. light .
i might be able to show them an old @-@ school trick .
it &apos;s worth a try .
come on , maura . my visitor &apos;s here .
come on where ?
to your office . it &apos;s an emergency .
what kind of emergency ?
the kind where you don &apos;t ask me any questions and trust me .
i don &apos;t like that type of emergency .
i @-@ i wanted to get t.j. something special .
it &apos;s a developmental mask .
you can play a really stimulating game of peekaboo .
and research shows that it boosts i.q. by ten points .
ten whole points ?
mm @-@ hmm .
we &apos;re gonna need a lot more masks .
you &apos;re such a good aunt .
oh , well , you know , we all love t.j.
the proposal was real sudden .
but abilene has good schools ,
and t.j. will be able to have lots of dogs , and ...
strawberry will be a good dad .
mm , a good dad , like tommy ?
he &apos;ll change his diaper and sing him to sleep
and clean the spit @-@ up -- it was so sweet .
tommy is so good with that baby .
but t.j. is his son , so ...
yeah .
but we &apos;ll have a house ,
and t.j. will have brothers and sisters .
stuart wants his own kids .
&quot; his own kids &quot; ?
poor t.j.
i &apos;ve got to go .
oh , well , we wanted to throw you
a goodbye dinner before you left .
oh , yeah . that sounds nice . call me .
yeah -- we-- uh , no . uh , t @-@ tonight .
what a good idea .
oh , i can &apos;t ...
really ? oh , that &apos;s too bad ...
&apos;cause with all the budget cuts ,
tonight &apos;s my last night here .
it is ?
yes . they are transferring me ...
to guam .
whoa , all the way out by braintree ?
farther .
yeah , let &apos;s have a girls &apos; night .
yeah ? okay . yes !
yay !
uh , so , um , tonight ? 7 : 00 ?
okay .
all right .
okay .
guam ?
sergeant korsak is in the crime lab , working on the receipt .
okay . i want to get our victim &apos;s profile out to the media .
will you please help me with lydia ?
of course .
but , jane , that ring that he gave her --
it &apos;s a cubic zirconia .
the nerve !
vidal sassoon always came through for me .
moment of truth .
you did it . there &apos;s a name .
cortez bodega .
there &apos;s a date , too . friday the 28th -- two days ago .
cortez bodega is located on cortez street ,
that &apos;s across the street from the off @-@ 93 apparel factory ,
which is the same brand of clothing
that the victim was wearing .
maybe our victim worked at that factory .
that &apos;s why she was shopping at a bodega across the street .
i &apos;ll get frost and frankie . we &apos;ll check it out .
we &apos;d like to show you a computer @-@ generated photo
of what we think she looked like .
and you think she worked here ?
we do .
it looks like isabella .
that &apos;s her .
she &apos;s the daughter of one of our seamstresses .
she started working in packaging two months ago .
do you recognize this woman ?
bianca valdez ,
isabella &apos;s mother .
is she working today ?
yes .
i &apos;ll go get her .
i talked to the bodega owner . he remembers the victim .
i got the security @-@ camera video from friday .
did he remember what she bought ?
a religious candle ...
and a pregnancy kit .
oh , boy .
is it isabella ?
she &apos;s dead , isn &apos;t she ?
yes .
did your daughter go to st . evillius ?
yes .
every sunday .
she made her first communion there .
is there any reason she would &apos;ve been there friday night ?
i don &apos;t think so .
she was beautiful .
inside , too .
so smart , so sweet .
she was accepted into every college she applied to .
why didn &apos;t she go ?
look , we don &apos;t care about your status , okay ?
we care about your daughter .
she didn &apos;t get to go to college
because she couldn &apos;t take the scholarships
once they knew ...
that she was undocumented .
help us find her killer .
we need a list of her friends .
they all went off to college ...
and left her behind to work in a factory ,
like her mother .
did isabella have a boyfriend ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t think so .
um , this is our chief medical examiner , dr. maura isles .
i am terribly sorry to tell you
that your daughter was four weeks &apos; pregnant .
oh , dios ...
dios ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
can you tell us what this tattoo means ?
four corners .
the four corners gang ?
we both worked four corners drug cases .
never saw one like that .
we found the same mark on your daughter .
it &apos;s only for the chosen few --
special girls the gang leaders want for themselves .
did you know that your daughter was in a gang ?
she wasn &apos;t in a gang .
four corners took her , and they killed her .
why do you say that ?
once that mark is on you , you &apos;re their property .
they kill you if you leave before they &apos;re done with you .
ay , dios ,
my poor girl .
we &apos;re gonna do everything we can to find your daughter &apos;s killer .
i know you will .
you brought her home to me .
i asked maura to look up that tattoo in old autopsy photos ,
see if maybe there were any victims before she was the m.e.
that &apos;s a good idea .
isabella &apos;s mother said
the four corners would kill a girl who tried to leave .
isabella didn &apos;t have time to leave .
she was killed the same day they inked her .
something else happened .
jane , i think i found what you &apos;re looking for
in the archives .
frost , can you look up a cold case --
araceli ramirez ?
there might be more . i just went back through 2004 .
araceli ramirez was killed near four corners in 2004 .
all three suspects were gang members .
where are those suspects today ?
two are in prison . one dead .
isabella clocks in for work at 7 : 00 a.m.
goes to the bodega during lunch , works until 4 : 00 .
did frankie say if there was a bathroom in the bodega ?
yeah , in the back .
so , isabella takes a full hour for lunch .
maybe she takes the pregnancy test in the store bathroom .
yeah , that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .
and what does an 18 @-@ year @-@ old practicing catholic girl
with no money do when she finds out she &apos;s pregnant ?
she definitely doesn &apos;t have an abortion .
she talks to a friend .
yeah . and isabella didn &apos;t have a cellphone ,
so maybe it was a work friend .
maybe someone with ties to four corners .
let &apos;s pull employee records and run them .
frost , look for any off @-@ 93 employee who has gang affiliations .
oh , my god . it &apos;s 6 : 30 , jane .
so ?
so , at 7 : 00 , people are showing up at your apartment .
oh , my god . i totally forgot .
go . we got this .
thanks , guys !
it &apos;s so nice of you to make a homemade dinner .
yeah .
it &apos;s not a problem . i love to cook .
isn &apos;t she such a good dog ?
oh , yes , she is .
yes , you are a good doggie . oh , yes , you are .
so , how fun that you are moving to abilene .
you can go to the rodeo ,
and -- and celebrate the pioneer spirit ,
and , you know , what else are you gonna do ?
i just can &apos;t wait to fill a house
with doggies and kittens and babies .
right , jo friday ?
who &apos;s a good doggie ?
who &apos;s a good doggie ?
only you and tommy can get her to do that .
she doesn &apos;t do that for anybody else .
yeah . tommy and t.j. would , you know , play with her
and take her for walks .
it will be so sad that tommy can &apos;t do that anymore .
yeah ... that is sad .
you should hear t.j. laugh when he plays with tommy .
sad he isn &apos;t gonna have his daddy .
lydia , can you get that for me ?
i @-@ i have a neighbor returning something .
lydia .
what are you doing here ?
moving the couch .
uh , where &apos;d you want it , vanilla ?
where it is .
frankie said he &apos;d give us 200 bucks to move it .
did he ?
tommy , you should stay for dinner .
yes , you should .
and we &apos;ll help you move the couch later .
so sorry for your trouble .
oh , no -- no trouble . no trouble .
mmm . that &apos;s home cooking . mmm . that smells good .
why you gotta be like that ?
get out .
get out . - that &apos;s no -- okay . all right .
okay .
here .
sit down .
dinner will be ready soon .
get the dog .
why ?
just do it !
it will just be a couple more minutes .
oh , jo friday !
bad dog !
oh , your pot roast . jane .
she sure loves pot roast .
that &apos;s so cute .
so , maura , we should probably get some take @-@ out , right ?
yes . yeah .
okay . we &apos;ll be fast .
but you two should stay here and keep an eye on jo friday .
how come ?
well , she could choke on that pot roast .
she has a small gullet .
bye .
bye .
what are you doing ? !
what am i doing ? what are you doing ?
move .
jo friday really likes you .
okay . okay , she just said that jo friday really likes tommy .
well , that &apos;s good .
verbal compliments often serve as foreplay ,
which then lead to the release of dopamine and oxytocin .
oh , dope and oxycontin ?
they gonna have a good night .
so , that &apos;s the ring he gave you , huh ?
he just asked about her ring .
do you think he &apos;ll notice it &apos;s a cubic zirconia ?
i think he &apos;ll notice it &apos;s the size of a grain of sand .
must have cost him a whole $ 10 .
yeah , he noticed .
at least he has a job !
ohh , the big box copy boy !
well , it &apos;s better than taking money
for moving his sister &apos;s couch because she feels sorry for you !
ouch .
wow , you got that food fast .
look , i &apos;m sorry . i just --
we &apos;ll have to do this all in guam . i have to go .
that went well .
frankie helped me cross @-@ reference
the gang database and off @-@ 93 employee records .
so , did you find isabella &apos;s work friend ?
think so .
josie garcia .
a member of four corners .
she &apos;s was arrested six times for assault and battery ,
four times for drugs .
nice friend .
she worked with isabella in packing .
i &apos;m getting josie &apos;s phone records ,
see if she texted her gang buddies
to help her beat up isabella .
the substance that frankie noticed on isabella &apos;s pant leg
is red candle wax .
she bought a candle at the bodega .
we need to come up with a way to get rid of strawberry .
sounds like a conspiracy i don &apos;t want to be part of .
i &apos;m gonna grab some coffee . want any ?
no , thanks .
&quot; get rid of &quot; ?
sounds like the words of a mob boss &apos;s daughter .
which i am .
think about it -- everybody has a dark side .
we simply exploit stuart &apos;s .
really ? what &apos;s his &quot; dark side &quot; ?
did he make copies of his butt at the big box store ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s enough .
no , i know he hasn &apos;t been arrested .
oh , did a background check .
you abused your authority .
why don &apos;t you keep your voice down , all right ?
yes , i wanted to know if a grown man that goes by &quot; strawberry &quot;
was ever arrested for child abuse or urinating in public .
the only dark thing i noticed about him
were his periorbital circles .
dark circles under his eyes .
stuart has severe allergies .
okay . well , thank you .
that &apos;s very helpful , maura .
but i don &apos;t think lydia &apos;s gonna turn down a house
and medical insurance and her doggies because stuart ... has allergies .
oh , my god .
allergies !
severe allergies .
that &apos;s it ! it &apos;s --
warrant came through . i &apos;ve got josie &apos;s texts ...
okay , now we &apos;re talking .
to tito -- &quot; the 1 u like is pregnant . &quot;
it &apos;s time @-@ stamped right at her lunch .
and there &apos;s a response from this &quot; tito &quot; person .
&quot; beat her down and ink her . &quot;
what does that mean ?
you can read latin but you can &apos;t understand that ?
gang unit lists tito varela as the leader of four corners .
he &apos;s out on parole .
so , tito wanted isabella .
and josie made it her job to deliver .
sounds right .
josie texted her two friends
after she heard from tito .
&quot; ball up ink party 4 on cortez . &quot;
latin is simpler .
no , they planned to ambush isabella on cortez street ...
... until she curled up into a &quot; ball . &quot;
&quot; 4 &quot; means 4 : 00 -- right after work .
maybe tito finished her off in the church .
yeah , check and see if tito &apos;s parole
requires electronic monitoring .
yeah , he &apos;s on an ankle bracelet ...
but he didn &apos;t leave his house from friday to sunday .
so that means tito &apos;s not our killer .
let &apos;s go see josie .
is it okay if i take frankie ? he was really helpful .
yeah . he could use the practice .
take a good look , josie .
she thought you were her friend .
she was dumb , then .
dumb to tell you she was pregnant .
we didn &apos;t do that to her .
we inked her . that &apos;s all .
you did a little more than that .
you broke both of her arms .
not on purpose .
tito told you to ink her .
why ? he want a relationship with her ?
&quot; relationship &quot; ? nah .
he saw her , he wanted to bang her .
so he wasn &apos;t the father of her baby ?
no . that &apos;s why i had to tell tito .
she thought she could break away ,
didn &apos;t have to be part of four corners .
do you know who the father was ?
some college boy .
what &apos;s his name ?
i don &apos;t know .
think hard , josie .
you &apos;re still looking at murder .
what ? !
some guy she met at church .
that &apos;s all i know .
jane &apos;s told me bits and pieces about tommy &apos;s predicament .
yeah .
i can &apos;t imagine losing this little baby .
that &apos;s the mother of the girl we found in the church .
ms. valdez ?
good morning .
sergeant , i found something
in the back of my daughter &apos;s closet .
is that your baby ?
oh , gosh , no .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s my grandbaby .
i &apos;ll never have a grandchild .
could i get you something ? a cup of coffee ?
no , no . thank you .
um , sergeant , please , look inside .
i don &apos;t know what it means .
britmore college .
do you know who it belongs to ?
i might .
the church gardener &apos;s kid , samuel morales ,
goes to britmore .
running him .
no arrest record .
i &apos;ll get his phone records and his credit cards .
i &apos;ll grab jane . we &apos;ll bring him in .
samuel , we have the records right here .
you took the 6 : 00 p.m. train
from new haven to boston on friday .
you came to boston after isabella called you
on the prepaid phone you bought for her , didn &apos;t you ?
did isabella join a gang ? she start seeing somebody else ?
she make you jealous , sam ?
isabella wasn &apos;t in a gang .
she should &apos;ve gone to britmore with me .
she was brilliant .
they inked her
because she didn &apos;t want be part of four corners .
when did you see isabella &apos;s tattoo ?
in the church .
i met her there .
why did you kill her , samuel ?
my father told me that we couldn &apos;t be seen together ...
... or the four corner gang @-@ bangers
were gonna kill us both .
i left her in that church .
why did i do that ?
you left her after you strangled her ?
he said he would take care of it .
i want to talk to father crowley .
get out of here !
i want to talk to father crowley !
okay .
i think he might want to confess .
even if he does , it won &apos;t be admissable
because i can &apos;t testify .
understood , father . but
maybe he &apos;ll talk to us once he talks to you .
he &apos;s in here .
frost ! help us ! we &apos;ve got to get him down !
father , he &apos;s still alive ! call an ambulance !
hey ! someone ! ambulance !
watch his head .
come on , samuel .
come on , buddy .
he &apos;s in critical condition , but he &apos;s alive .. thanks .
what about brain damage ?
they don &apos;t think so ,
but there &apos;s a lot of damage to his larynx .
damn .
as soon as he gets out of the hospital ,
he &apos;ll be going on trial for killing his girlfriend .
why did samuel say his father wouldn &apos;t let
him and isabella be seen with gang @-@ bangers ?
frost , can you look up mateo morales ?
yeah .
his father seemed to know the gang would kill her
once a banger like tito had claimed her .
yeah . &quot; he said he &apos;d take care of it . &quot;
what did that mean ?
mateo morales , sam &apos;s father ,
was once a four corners gang member .
look at the rosary .
explains the ligature marks .
st. margaret of cortona ,
patron saint of single mothers .
isabella would have given up samuel
and taken care of their baby by herself
if she thought that &apos;d give samuel a better life .
but you knew samuel would never give up isabella , didn &apos;t you ?
you told your son you &apos;d take care of it .
he thought you meant
that you &apos;d help take care of him and his pregnant girlfriend .
instead , you wrapped that rosary around isabella &apos;s neck
and strangled that 18 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
i bet we find isabella &apos;s dna on that rosary .
she belonged to them .
she wasn &apos;t a gang member .
she was once they made her one .
i had no choice .
she was their property .
they would &apos;ve killed my son for trying to take her .
you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of isabella valdez .
it &apos;s really nice of you to babysit .
come here , baby . come here !
yeah . i didn &apos;t know how i was going to get lyds here
to my big box going @-@ away party .
copy department knows how to throw a party ,
that &apos;s for sure .
t.j. !
what &apos;s up , buddy ? oh . oh , no . i ...
i @-@ i @-@ i can &apos;t be near animals .
here you go , take that .
i got to go .
wait . y @-@ you &apos;re allergic to dogs ?
all dogs ?
take a shower .
and call me -- oh . oh . oh .
stuart .
take a shower ?
uh , well , you know , we can still babysit .
yeah , um , if you want to go somewhere , you know ,
or do something .
take advantage of the free babysitting .
well , i can &apos;t go to the big box party , so ...
we could go for a walk ?
yeah , sure .
i &apos;d like that .

yeah !
high five , baby .
you don &apos;t want to go with that weirdo strawberry . no .
what do we do if lydia chooses strawberry over pets ?
then auntie jane goes rogue again .
we need to discuss your lawless behavior .
not in front of the nephew , maura .
me . me . can i hold you ?
