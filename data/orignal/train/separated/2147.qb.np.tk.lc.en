all units , be advised .
armed robbery in progress at aloha tower marketplace .
he &apos;s done , keep moving .
come on , get in , get in .
go , go , go , go .
all units , suspects are eastbound
from the aloha tower marketplace in a gray taxi .
2 bravo , 140,
we are pursuing suspect vehicle northbound on richards street .
2 bravo , 140 , do we have a current direction of travel ?
negative .
we &apos;ve lost sight of him in the area of richards and king .
dispatch , be advised ,
we no longer have the gray taxi .
repeat , we have lost the suspects .
how do you recover from something like that ?
you don &apos;t .
cath , i need a favor .
of course .
i want you to help me find my mother .
really ?
yeah .
wait , i thought you told witness protection
that you wanted her location kept secret ,
even from you .
yeah , i did .
but that was before i found out she had a chance to kill wo fat
and she didn &apos;t do it .
what ? but i don &apos;t understand .
why would she do that ?
i don &apos;t know .
but the crime lab said she intentionally fired her weapon
into the floor when wo fat confronted her .
she didn &apos;t want him hurt .
she let him escape .
i want to know why .
and if you don &apos;t like the answer ?
well , i can handle the truth .
but this is your mother we &apos;re talking about , steve .
catherine , that &apos;s not going to prevent me from doing my job .
okay ? look , will you do it ?
will you help me ?
you &apos;ll owe me .
what &apos;s new ? add it to my tab .
don &apos;t think i won &apos;t .
mcgarrett .
yeah , i &apos;m on the way .
three armed male suspects knocked over
an art gallery .
one guy got shot as they were making off
and holed up in that store over there .
between employees and customers , we &apos;re estimating
at least a dozen hostages .
he make any demands yet ?
yeah , he says he &apos;s willing to give up
one of the hostages if we send in some medical help .
okay , if he &apos;s really badly wounded ,
it might be safer for the hostages
if we just wait him out .
yeah , i like that .
the gandhi approach : we sit back ,
let him bleed out . situation resolved .
problem with that is we need him alive , so we can flip him
for the names of his partners .
i &apos;m gonna need a vest .
vest , please .
you don &apos;t even know what my plan is yet .
that &apos;s true , but i know you , and i know that any plan you have
is going to involve me in potential serious bodily harm .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talk about this , okay ?
let &apos;s just say that over the years ,
our marriage has become predictable .
you know ...
okay ,
so what &apos;s the plan ?
well , he wants a paramedic . we &apos;re gonna give him a paramedic .
let &apos;s go .
let &apos;s go .
nice and slow .
turn around .
put your kit on the floor .
now !
make a move ,
and i put a hole in you .
mister , that wound looks pretty nasty .
i wouldn &apos;t waste time if i were you .
i &apos;d shut up if i were you .
turn around .
look , you &apos;re gonna die unless you let me help you .
what &apos;s in there ?
medical supplies .
kick it over .
freeze . freeze .
drop your weapon .
stay down .
i &apos;ll kill her , i swear to god .
maybe , but you &apos;re not gonna get out of here alive .
put it down .
get them out of here .
listen , just let her go , huh ?
back off .
you &apos;re dying . let us help .
it &apos;s not worth it , buddy .
back off , or you &apos;re gonna be wearing her blood .
what did you do ?
what did i ... i didn &apos;t do anything .
you didn &apos;t have to .
he &apos;s dead .
so , mr. strathern ,
you said the men who robbed your gallery ,
they didn &apos;t take any cash from the register .
they only wanted what was in the safe ?
that &apos;s right .
they , uh , stole some
of our more expensive lithographs .
did you recognize any of these men ?
no , no , they were wearing masks .
why do you ask ?
because if they targeted something specific in your safe ,
they could have been disgruntled employees
or business partners .
i , um , i don &apos;t have partners .
my @-@ my grandfather opened up the first shop back in 1946 .
i &apos;s been family @-@ run ever since .
okay , i &apos;m gonna need you
to do an inventory of everything that was taken .
of course . i &apos;ll have a list for you in a few hours .
you were very lucky back there , my friend .
i &apos;m sorry , lucky ?
okay , first of all , luck had nothing to do with it .
i had the situation under control .
oh , okay , well , you are something else .
that &apos;s right .
you must have known our suspect
was gonna bleed to death while threatening to kill a hostage .
you &apos;re good . you &apos;re really good .
let me ask you another question .
how much money
do i have in my wallet , kreskin ?
or should i say the amazing mcgarrett ?
you done ?
&apos;cause i want to see who &apos;s calling me .
don &apos;t you already know who &apos;s calling you ?
i do . it &apos;s max .
you &apos;re lying .
i &apos;m not lying ; i have caller i.d.
you &apos;re a fraud .
yes , max ?
got to give these art aficionados credit .
by torching the getaway car ,
they basically burned our chances
of getting dna , prints , anything .
gentlemen .
peg leg .
a peg leg is a prosthesis
often made of wood and portrayed
in pirate movies . a cane ,
such as the one i am using ,
is a mobility aid .
and ballistic trauma is not something
to be making fun of , detective williams .
i knew i should have just said hello .
what do we got , max ?
well , i haven &apos;t had the time to make
many preliminary observations .
however , i can tell you that the victim appears
to be male and mid @-@ 40s .
oh , and seeing as he looks
like something that belongs at the bottom of an ash tray ,
i &apos;m gonna say that the cause of death was ,
and this is just a guess ,
fire .
wow , &apos; cause that wasn &apos;t obnoxious at all .
i was only trying to participate in the jocularity .
you know what , max , never mind mr. negativity here .
i thought it was funny .
mahalo .
okay , so if fire didn &apos;t kill this guy , what did ?
well , in all probability ,
the gunshot wound to the rear
of the cranium was the culprit .
all right , using a taxi as a getaway vehicle .
it &apos;s the perfect way to blend into mall traffic .
it idles by the curb ; nobody asks any questions .
these guys are slick .
maybe your boy crispy here
just picked up the wrong fare .
no way , no .
the way hpd described the chase , this guy was in on it .
once he did his part , his partners double @-@ crossed him .
commander mcgarrett is correct .
our victim was no ordinary cabdriver .
how do you know ?
because this is no ordinary cab .
whoa , you &apos;re not kidding .
that &apos;s a high @-@ performance racing engine
with a full nitris system .
so this thing was just painted up to look like a taxi .
yes , with 763 horsepower , the hpd didn &apos;t have any chance .
max , i &apos;m gonna need an i.d. on this guy
as soon as possible .
you got it .
i knew you wouldn &apos;t sit still for long .
i just can &apos;t be at home right now .
two years ago i thought i lost malia forever .
it was this job that brought her back to me .
that was time i thought i &apos;d never have with her .
and will always be so grateful .
there &apos;s no need to feel sorry for me , cuz .
i &apos;ll see her again .
if there &apos;s anything ...
i know .
hey , you i.d. &apos; d our dead hostage taker from the mall .
yeah , name &apos;s george solani .
he &apos;s an ex @-@ con with priors for armed robbery and assault .
i also checked into his past associates
to see if we might get a match on our two outstanding suspects .
the trouble is , his old crime partners are deceased or already in jail .
so ... obviously he found a new crew .
yeah .
hey , you are not supposed to be here .
so i hear .
thanks for being there for me this morning .
come on , man . of course .
that &apos;s what family &apos;s for .
i love you , brah .
you all right ?
yeah .
come on . let &apos;s get to work .
all right .
what &apos;s the latest ?
all right , our gallery owner , karl strathern ,
sent me photos of the lithographs that were stolen during the heist .
did he give you an estimated value ?
$ 30,000 , retail .
30,000 ?
yeah .
anyone else find that strange ?
those guys went to a lot of trouble for 30k .
the car alone &apos;s worth more than the entire take .
why kill a cop and risk life in prison
for 30 stacks ? it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
unless he thought the lithos were originals , and worth a lot more .
okay , uh , even if these geniuses ,
uh , made a mistake and stole the cheap stuff ,
they still have to fence what they took .
true , and there can &apos;t be a
very large customer base for stolen art on the island .
yeah , that &apos;s true , but luckily we know somebody
who used to run in those circles .
hey , buddy .
i hope you &apos;re wearing sunblock .
yeah , skin cancer ?
bring it on .
my age , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you know ...
the one regret i have , having lived
on this island my whole life ...
i never learned to surf .
it &apos;s never to late to start .
tell that to my knees .
tell it to the rest of your body , too .
i &apos;m just saying .
say it to yourself , blondie .
well , you basically called yourself old when we sat down .
yeah , yeah , that &apos;s my business .
uh ... as an aging man ,
my time is at a premium .
so what brings you here ,
or did you just want to sit here
posing as garage sale bookends ?
here .
well , let me guess .
you want to know if i know this man .
do you ?
what ? this is a thing now ?
you come to me for help ?
a simple yes or no will suffice , march .
i almost got shot the last time i helped you .
i almost get shot every day . it &apos;s no fun .
i agree . listen , march ...
your help brought down a diamond smuggling ring .
yeah , according to the papers ,
those diamonds disappeared along with the killer of your suspect .
we &apos;ll find the shooter . we always do .
oh , yeah , yeah , well ...
obviously the girl was in over her head .
which brings us back to why you &apos;re here
with a picture of a dead man on your phone .
anything you tell us is confidential . you know that .
no .
i do not know this man .
enjoy the rest of your day .
we &apos;re not done .
oh , joy .
okay , did you hear about the art gallery robbery this morning ?
i was here all morning .
that was not an accusation .
huh . sorry , habit .
an art gallery was hit this morning on ala moana .
yeah ?
an hpd officer was killed .
all right , that dead guy on the phone ,
he was part of the crew that took down the score .
sounds like sloppy work to me .
was sloppy ... sloppy and stupid .
these guys went to a lot of trouble
to get their hands on $ 30,000 worth of lithographs .
does that sound strange to you ?
well , it all depends on the quality of the lithos .
if these mutts knew what they were doing ,
the art can be aged and reframed ,
and then sold as originals
to , uh , naive new money types .
okay , so if i wanted to unload something like that ,
who would i go to see to broker a deal ?
well , the only fence i know is yours truly .
and as you know , i &apos;m out of the business .
but because ...
i willing to do you two nudnicks a favor ,
and i cherish my me time ,
and hope that you &apos;ll soon disappear ,
i &apos;ll make a few inquiries .
good . thank you .
did you , uh ...
you said &quot; me time &quot; ?
yeah , i said &quot; me time . &quot;
starting now ,
it &apos;s my subtle way of saying bug off .
okay .
that was fast .
i got run .
i got a briefing with my sac in half hour .
ah , come on .
at least give me a chance to win some of my money back .
wish i could .
i &apos;ll see you back at the shop .
thanks for the early christmas bonus .
looking for someone to play with ?
seriously ?
rack &apos; em .
what are you drinking ?
whatever you &apos;re buying .
say hello to our cabdriver .
any luck identifying him ?
well , not yet , but this is fortuitous timing ,
because ... i &apos;m actually going to examine his skull right now .
why &apos;d you boil his face off , max ?
why ?
and why are you now playing laser tag with his skull ?
well , by stripping off the charred tissue ,
i &apos;m able to rebuild a computerized approximation
of the victim &apos;s face
by taking an accurate digital scan of his skull .
oh , my .
&quot; oh , my &quot; what ? you know him ?
it &apos;s tyler macnamara .
who &apos;s tyler macnamara ?
well , he &apos;s retired now , but during his heyday
he was the best stock car driver on the racing circuit .
that explains how he evaded police .
but not why he partook in the armed robbery .
the man made millions winning races and endorsements .
well , something brought him out of retirement to drive again .
all right , with the unlocked door
and the half @-@ eaten egg sandwich here on the dinning room table ,
i think it &apos;s safe to say that
macnamara left here in a hurry this morning .
all right , everybody take a room .
let &apos;s see if we can find some intel of opportunity to work off .
this place is very nice .
does not look to me like this guy was hurting for money .
you know , the background check said that
macnamara went through a divorce last year .
maybe the house is all he ended up with .
so he gets beat up by his wife in the divorce ,
she splits , takes all his cash and prizes ,
and he hits an art gallery ?
i can relate , but i &apos;m not buying it .
yeah , me neither .
macnamara &apos;s background say he have any kids ?
yeah , he &apos;s got a daughter named karen .
yeah , the kid has a bedroom upstairs .
clothes are in the closet .
okay , we need to find her .
guys , in here .
i found this on the desk .
daddy , please , do what they say .
i &apos;m so scared .
no wonder macnamara drove the getaway car .
they have his daughter .
please do what they say .
is my daughter still alive ?
at this point , we have no evidence
to lead us to believe that she is not .
when was the last time you spoke to karen ?
a couple days ago .
she was gonna spend the weekend at her father &apos;s place .
she loves the beach in front of his house .
have you noticed any changes in your daughter &apos;s life recently ?
um , changes ?
yeah , changes .
no new friends maybe ?
uh , sometimes in these cases ,
the victim will know their abductor .
karen had a new boyfriend .
okay .
i disapproved .
why ?
he was older .
he worked at an automotive shop on king street .
i just got a really bad feeling the first time i met him .
well , what &apos;s his name ?
george .
george solani ?
yes .
do you know him ?
do you think he &apos;s involved ?
we think he is .
oh , my god .
wait . you &apos;re irish ?
yeah .
no way .
this mick ...
bleeds kelly green , honey .
then what &apos;s with the trailer park drawl ?
irish by way of de kalb , illinois .
ah , home of barbed wire .
and cindy crawford .
bet you had a poster of her on your wall .
right above my bed .
no .
yeah , uh @-@ huh ... little tacky , i know ,
but , uh , i was 11 years old , you know .
there &apos;s no perv ruling on preteens .
uh , maybe not in de kalb .
and what is that supposed to mean ?
let me guess--
you lived right off main street ,
had a house with a white picket fence
and a dog named spot .
guinness , and she was a chocolate lab ,
and it was fernwood avenue , with a chain @-@ link fence ,
two blocks off of main street .
i was close .
you &apos;re pretty good at this .
so , irish from illinois
who wanted to grow up and marry cindy crawford ,
what brought you out to this little rock ?
uncle sam .
you &apos;re in the military ?
i was in the military , six years with the army ,
25th infantry division .
duty , honor , country .
hmm , and now ?
what do you do when you &apos;re not
hustling poor , innocent girls out of their paychecks ?
i work for the government .
mmm , so do i ,
or at least it feels that way
every april when i &apos;m filing my tax returns .
well , i &apos;m irish by way of de kalb , illinois .
home of barbed wire .
and cindy crawford .
let me guess--
you lived right off main street ,
had a house with a white picket fence
and a dog named spot .
guinness , and she was a chocolate lab ,
and it was fernwood avenue , with a chain @-@ link fence ,
two blocks off of main street .
i was close .
you &apos;re pretty good at this .
anything on solani ?
yeah , we pulled security video
from the auto shop that he worked at
and we found footage of him talking to two men
who fit the physical description of our suspects
from the gallery heist .
they ever turn around ?
no , these two are clearly camera shy .
yeah , but we did manage to isolate some distinctive tattoos
on the necks and forearms
to help us i.d. &apos; em .
we got a hit .
matt and tony kapule .
these guys are bad news .
all their priors are class &quot; a &quot; felonies .
do we have a current address ?
according to hpd , these two are m.i.a.
okay , so how do we find &apos; em ?
oh , the only thing you &apos;re going to find on me
is a few blood thinners .
kimo .
yeah , i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re paying these guys
by the spoken word ,
but if so , you really got a great deal with that guy .
yeah , he doesn &apos;t talk much but he listens well .
it &apos;s not every day i get a visit
from a man of your reputation and status , mr. march .
so what can i do for you , my friend ?
i got a job i need a little help with .
how many airbags you got in this boat ?
why ?
the way you &apos;re driving ,
i want as much protection as i can get .
okay , can we please focus ?
all right , i &apos;m , i &apos;m all jammed up here .
i &apos;m getting cramps .
you know , you &apos;re like the annoying little kid
in the car who keeps saying ,
&quot; we there yet , we there yet ? &quot;
patience .
well , are we there yet ?
i asked my old associate if he knew the kapule brothers .
he not only knew them .
he told me where to find &apos; em .
well , where would that be ?
sand island .
they got a warehouse there
that they use as a drop for their heists .
five @-@ o.
in here .
this one &apos;s dead .
this one &apos;s alive .
where is she ?
where is karen ?
where is karen ?
is she still alive ?
what did you do with her ?
this is chin ho kelly with five @-@ o.
where are you holding her ?
tell me now .
we need an ambulance right away .
hey , hey , do not die .
do not die on me , stay with me .
stay with me , stay with me .
where is ... ?
steve , danny .
what you got , chin ?
well , these are all the lithographs that were stolen this morning .
this is everything ?
it &apos;s everything on the gallery owner , &apos; s , list .
wait a minute , why kill the kapule brothers
and leave all the art behind ?
well , maybe they were killed buying something else .
miscreants like these tend to stack up enemies . right ?
hey , guys , you need to see this .
okay , so our vics took photos
of strathern &apos;s safe and its contents weeks ago .
check out the date stamp .
whoa , whoa , back up .
how &apos;d the kapule brothers get access to that safe to begin with ?
maybe they were working with someone on the inside .
or maybe they were the inside job .
take a look .
see that reflection ?
that &apos;s one of the brothers .
he &apos;s wearing a shirt that says pale security .
those guys install safes and security systems .
i see their trucks all over town .
okay , so that &apos;s it .
these guys pose as employees
so they can get in and case the safe .
hold on a second , widen out again .
let me see that .
okay , strathern said his safe was cleaned out , right ?
yeah , why ?
because these two pieces right here--
they were not on strathern &apos;s list of art that was stolen .
why wouldn &apos;t he report that ?
turns out these two paintings , along with half a dozen others ,
were stolen from an art dealer here
on the island back on december 7 , 1941 .
that &apos;s the day pearl harbor was attacked .
it was reported that
the thieves broke in and stole the paintings
while the owner was out helping search for survivors ,
and because of their extreme value ,
the hsi inherited the investigation .
why would strathern have these paintings in his safe ?
strathern told me that
his grandfather started the gallery in the &apos; 40s .
prior to that , there &apos;s no record
of him owning his own business .
okay , so grandpa-- he takes advantage of
one of the worst days in this country &apos;s history ,
steals these paintings among some others ,
sells a few , starts his own little dynasty .
wait a minute , you think strathern knew
where his grandfather got these pieces ?
it would certainly explain
why he &apos;s been keeping them hidden all these years .
and if that &apos;s the case ,
then strathern knows more
than he &apos;s told us about the heist .
yeah , and about the kidnapping of karen macnamara .
seriously , where does strathern think he &apos;s going ?
i think this tells us everything we need to know .
why do they always run ?
i believe it &apos;s because they are hoping
that the person chasing them
is going to end up wrapped around a telephone pole ,
which is very possible .
strathern , get out of the car .
get out .
turn around , turn around .
where &apos;s karen ?
i don &apos;t know who you &apos;re talking about .
who &apos;s karen ?
all right , turn around .
what &apos;d you do , conveniently forgot to tell us about these ?
listen to me very carefully .
unless you want to go down
for the kidnapping of karen macnamara
and the murder of her father ,
i suggest you tell us what the hell is going on right now .
look , i already told you ,
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
don &apos;t , don &apos;t do that , all right ?
do not waste our time .
okay , we already know about
your grandfather and his sticky fingers . okay ?
you don &apos;t get it , do you ?
i &apos;m the victim here .
that robbery this morning was all just a front
to extort me for money .
okay , so the kapule brothers stole those paintings ,
because they knew you would pay big money
to keep your family &apos;s secret , is that right ?
why , why did you keep those paintings , huh ?
why didn &apos;t you destroy them ?
they were a liability , evidence of a crime .
why keep them ?
those paintings were originals , priceless .
i couldn &apos;t bring myself to destroy them .
okay , so how &apos;d you get them back ?
i paid the thieves what they asked .
when ?
just now .
when just now ?
less than a half an hour ago .
that &apos;s impossible , see , because the kapule brothers--
they &apos;ve been dead for over two hours now .
who &apos;d you pay the money to ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know , i never met him before .
everything was done over the phone .
he made me wire money to an account in the caymans
before he provided me with a drop spot to pick up the paintings .
i got something .
it &apos;s just a partial ,
but based on the oil composition and layering ,
it came from the last person to touch this painting .
okay . we got a hit .
who is it ?
a guy named august march .
you know him ?
奥古斯特 · 马奇
what &apos;s this all about , mcgarrett ?
w @-@ why are you treating me like this ? huh ?
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a ballistics report .
it shows that the bullet that killed angela branson ,
who was &quot; the girl that got in over her head stealing diamonds , &quot;
do you remember her ,
matches the slugs that we pulled out of the kapule brothers .
so ?
so the same gun was used for all three murders .
i @-@ if you found out who killed that poor girl
they fished out of the harbor , good for you .
look , i &apos;m tired .
i &apos;d just like to go home now .
do me a favor , please .
okay , it was cute for a minute ,
but the whole helpless grandfather thing
is not going to work for you anymore .
hey , march , you , uh ...
you recognize this ?
no .
you should , because it belongs to you .
this gun is the gun that was used
to kill angela and the kapule brothers ,
and we found it in your apartment .
okay .
i &apos;m an old man with lots of enemies .
i needed protection .
i got that gun off the street .
i didn &apos;t have time to check on its history .
nice try .
i personally think that the , uh ,
extortion method was definitely the way to go .
i mean , why go through the trouble of
fencing a couple of high @-@ profile paintings
when you could just sell them back to the owner ?
you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m talking about .
no idea .
no idea .
any idea how your prints
ended up on the stolen artwork ?
no .
i mean , gloves .
that &apos;s what i would have done .
i mean , i figure an old pro like you would know to wear gloves .
30 years in prison made you rusty , march .
maybe it &apos;s just old age .
maybe .
i &apos;m not going back to jail .
i don &apos;t think you have a choice .
what are my options ?
i don &apos;t think you understand . you @-@ you don &apos;t have any options .
you &apos;re going back behind bars where you belong .
there are always options .
what if i took you
to where the kapule brothers hid karen ?
no , no . you &apos;re bluffing .
look at the last photo .
this is time @-@ stamped five hours ago .
tell me , karen &apos;s still alive ?
of course she is .
i &apos;ve always got an ace up my sleeve when i play poker .
all right . get up .
over there .
pull over .
i &apos;ll take you to her .
where is she ?
this way .
it &apos;s just up there to the left .
m.e. &apos; s office scooped up what was left of march .
hpd &apos;s gonna comb the area and canvas out .
we &apos;re not going to find karen out here .
oh , you call me mr. negativity ?
danny , march played us .
he led us out here knowing he was going to jump in front of that truck .
sometimes suicide is impulsive .
nothing about march was impulsive .
he was always thinking two moves ahead .
and the minute we caught him , the minute ,
he decided he was going out on his own terms .
i guess at that age ,
the road kill option is preferable to dying in prison .
at the same time , he gets to lead us on a goose chase
before he checks out . fine .
exactly .
hey , kono , you got me and danny . what &apos;s up ?
i ran a list of matt kapule &apos;s aliases ,
and i got a hit on a credit card he used two days ago to rent a car .
a red 2012 altima .
okay , the car that they stashed karen in was red .
right . so , we compared
the proof @-@ of @-@ life photo against the factory specs ,
and they &apos;re the exact same dimensions .
okay , that &apos;s got to be our car .
did we get a plate ?
yeah . hpd has birds in the air looking for it .
okay , wait a minute . that could take days .
we need to narrow this search grid ,
and we can rule out street parking , too .
i &apos;m pretty sure they wouldn &apos;t want that car getting towed .
yeah . no , steve &apos;s right .
they &apos;re gonna hide the car some place
where it &apos;ll go unnoticed for a while .
yeah , someplace people leave cars for long periods of time .
try long @-@ term parking .
i &apos;ll get hpd calling in a description
to every long @-@ term parking structure on the island .
some log license plates , some don &apos;t .
all right , good . have them start on the south end of the island
and work their way up , all right ?
okay . why ?
because march dragged us all the way up here to the pali highway .
i figured he wanted to lure us as far away from karen as possible .
you got it .
anything ?
security camera caught our altima
entering a parking structure by the airport .
is it still there ?
no record of it leaving ,
but the place is roughly five acres .
the car could be anywhere in there .
a manual search would take hours .
yeah , but our friends over at norsat are redirecting a satellite
over the lot , so if karen &apos;s still in the car ,
they &apos;ll pick her up on thermal imaging .
guys , i think we have something .
it &apos;s a body .
let &apos;s go .
all right , there it is .
she &apos;s alive .
hey . hey . you hear me ?
this is detective danny williams with five @-@ o.
we need an ambulance up here right away .
you &apos;ll be okay .
doctor says , &quot; if this is the pencil ,
then where &apos;s my thermometer ? &quot;

you &apos;ve told me that joke once a month . aloha .

in a flying death trap ?

your slogan needs some work .
what do you mean , it needs work ?
linguistically @-@ speaking , it doesn &apos;t flow .
it needs to rhyme . it can &apos;t ...
it doesn &apos;t need to rhyme .
it does !
you can &apos;t do a jingle .
yeah ?
i forgot it already .
no . you know what ?
the very first time i laid eyes on malia , was right here on this beach .
i was , uh , staying here at the hilton
while my apartment was getting repainted .
there she was .
she was riding these little ankle slappers ,
and she still managed to lose her board .
you know , i &apos;ve actually done that myself .
i found her board , of course ,
but i told her she couldn &apos;t get it back
until she agreed to go out to dinner with me .
nice . extortion .
it &apos;s a good move .
mm @-@ hmm .
it didn &apos;t quite work out , though .
she told me i could keep it .
and then , about a week later ,
i get a knock on my door from some surf shop saying
that the board is actually theirs ,
and i owe them five days rental .
that &apos;s great .
the player gets played .
yeah .
huh ?
when she heard the news , um ,
she felt pity on me , and she called me .
um ... that &apos;s ... that &apos;s ...
you hungry ?
bro , i am starving .
all right , let &apos;s go . mcgarrett &apos;s buying .
mcgarrett never buys .
i know . i just wanted to hear those words out loud .

ha , ha . more jocularity at my expense .
excuse me .
