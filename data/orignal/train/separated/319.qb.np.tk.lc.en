ah , it &apos;s like i &apos;m back in my mother &apos;s womb .
only , there &apos;s food here .
ugh , those e @-@ cigs are so stupid .
i mean , smoking real cigarettes kills you ,
but smoking fake ones makes me want to kill you .
they &apos;re not smoking . they &apos;re vaping .
uh @-@ oh . he just passed it to her .
someone &apos;s getting date vaped .
i just figured out the new phones .
now i &apos;ve got to figure out how to smoke ?
if i wanted to learn everything all over again ,
i would have had a stroke .
hey guys , sorry , but you &apos;re not allowed to do that in here .
and i &apos;m not talking about your outfits .
i &apos;ll get to those when i bring the check .
relax , it &apos;s not a cigarette .
it has a battery .
yeah , so does my vibrator , but ...
can &apos;t use that in here either .
i didn &apos;t approve that rule .
well , i think we ordered too many of our cupcake tees .
there are more unworn shirts here
than in matthew mcconaughey &apos;s closet .
hey , girls .
look at me .
i got my sunday bra on &apos; cause i just came from church .
was it my church ?
the church of latter @-@ day sluts ?
oleg and i are looking for one to get married in .
and it &apos;s got to have a wheelchair ramp
&apos;cause i &apos;ve got a lot of cousins who were born without leg bones .
i &apos;m so excited for you , sophie .
you deserve all the happiness in the world .
i mean , so do i , but that &apos;s obviously not happening .
are you done with your pity @-@ party ?
&apos;cause i got to speak to max .
max , do you want to be my maid of honor ?
i would rather be eaten alive by a rabbit .
which would take a long time and be a lot less embarrassing .
and sophie , you don &apos;t really want me to be your maid of honor .
that &apos;s right . i don &apos;t .
so why are we even talking about it ?
sophie , as honored as i am that you asked ,
it &apos;s just not really my thing , you know , man ?
is this really not your thing ?
it &apos;s nobody &apos;s thing .
you just do it &apos; cause you &apos;re supposed to ,
like bleaching your teeth or your anus .
thank god i &apos;m off the list ,
&apos;cause that bridesmaid spa day is gonna be rough .
look , i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s just , i was a maid of honor
in fifth grade when my mom married her cult leader .
and then she was my maid of honor
when i married him a week later .
so i &apos;m kind of maid @-@ of @-@ honored out .
maybe i &apos;ll get one of my old sorority sisters
to be my bridesmaid .
i &apos;m gonna go home and find out
which one is still thin enough to fly commercial .
all right , where are we gonna store all these shirts ?
it &apos;s already too crowded in here
with all the cupcakes , shame , and failure .
we &apos;ll sell some of these at the cupcake window ,
20 of these are already going
to that fancy boutique in manhattan ,
and the rest , maybe we &apos;ll get lucky
and find a gay little league team .
oh , i know !
let &apos;s get drunk .
that &apos;s your solution to everything .
seriously .
we need to just take some to that new bar
where idiots pay $ 20 for a drink .
drunk and stupid , that &apos;s our target audience .
and also , the special skills i &apos;ve listed on my resume .
so you &apos;re saying we &apos;re gonna stoop so low
as to sell t @-@ shirts out of a duffle bag in a bar ?
yeah , we &apos;re there .
how much do you think this pays ?
&apos;cause i can do that .
yes , you can .
all you need is a stepladder and boobs .
feel like the : star trek : next generation bar .
keep your eyes peeled for whoopi goldberg in a crazy hat .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m selling t @-@ shirts
out of a duffle bag in the future , too .
yeah . i fully support mixing business and pleasure .
best sex i ever had was with my boss at a panera bread .
i thought you said the best sex you ever had
was with a dude with six fingers .
same guy .
man , could he make a sandwich crazy fast .
hi . want to buy a cool tee for your girlfriend ?
let me see if my girlfriend wants a tee .
you want a tee , honey ?
hey ! hey !
not so fast .
they say &quot; cream filled &quot; on the back .
huh , boys ? anything ?
wow , gays aren &apos;t fun in the future .
jesus comes back in the future .
so what &apos;s in the bag ?
i &apos;ve never met a girl at a bar with actual baggage .
that &apos;s funny because you mean like emotional .
you &apos;re really beautiful .
you weren &apos;t nearly this hot in the book .
so can i get you ladies a drink ?
sure , you could jut change this water into wine .
can you , like , do this for me , just , like , once ?
drinks on me .
oh , lucky them .
i haven &apos;t heard i &apos;m beautiful
from a non @-@ homeless person in months .
well , with that hair , the jury &apos;s still out .
hey , can i kiss you ?
i suppose a peck wouldn &apos;t--
say what ?
i &apos;m james .
i &apos;m wet .
because my arm was sitting in water on the bar .
that was so hot , max .
i have , like , this animal attraction to him .
what animal ? the horny nerd ?
look , i &apos;ll leave . you stay and do your thing .
but we came together .
yeah , i know you guys did .
it happened , like , the second he kissed you .
i don &apos;t do this . i just met him .
look , caroline .
i haven &apos;t read the bible .
but i know that when jesus returns ,
you must follow him back to his apartment .
let go ...
let god ...
get to third base .
max , where &apos;s caroline ?
i haven &apos;t seen her all day .
but i &apos;m guessing she &apos;s in heaven .
i &apos;m here , i &apos;m here .
nope , she &apos;s in hell .
walk of shame , party of one .
girl .
gir @-@ irl !
tell me everything that happened .
leave out no details .
it was insane . i mean , like , so hot .
like the caribbean or our shower that one time .
what are you two celebrating ?
i know it isn &apos;t a job well done .
we are celebrating the release of the new :
star wars : episode vii trailer online .
seriously ?
max , we did everything .
we--
oleg , can you give us some privacy ?
what ?
i can &apos;t be in the ladies &apos; room .
i can &apos;t be in the kitchen .
so did you ...
no .
well , did you ...
no !
well , did you at least ...
oh , god , no !
well , what did you do ?
water a plant together ?
we had sex .
last night and today .
that &apos;s a big thing for me .
and , yes , it was .
yes . that was obvious in the bar .
skinny jeans are just boner x @-@ rays .
oh , no . oh , no .
what , rat in the slaw again ?
my rings .
i left them at his place .
i have to get them back .
they &apos;re half my belongings .
so just text him and say , &quot; yo , i left my rings ,
nice wiener , &quot; &quot; 100 &quot; emoji , send .
max , i can &apos;t text a guy first .
it &apos;s bad enough i have a groupon for intimacy oil .
look , worst @-@ case scenario ,
the mcrib is gone for good .
second worst @-@ case scenario ,
we can always implement the two @-@ week rule .
the two @-@ week rule ?
wait , isn &apos;t that how long you have to eat pad thai
before it becomes bad thai ?
no , you really have to read my book .
it means if he doesn &apos;t text for two weeks ,
you can break in and get your stuff .
all that fancy school and you didn &apos;t learn nothing .
two weeks and nothing .
i really thought he &apos;d text .
i also thought : grown ups 2 should have won the oscar .
still got it .
come on .
wait , before i lose the rest of my self @-@ esteem ...
tell that to the wall you &apos;re currently straddling .
let me just check my phone one more time to see if he--
nope .
self @-@ esteem gone .
i &apos;m afraid to jump .
jump , whore , jump !
i sound like my mom teaching me how to swim .
i did it . i did it .
that was , like , two feet .
i &apos;ve snorted lines longer .
all right .
just another tuesday .
going all : bling ring in jesus &apos; backyard .
改编自真实的 &quot; 好莱坞大盗案 &quot;
there . that &apos;s his bedroom window .
i know &apos; cause we had to close it , since i &apos;m kind of loud .
oh , what are you like during sex ?
what do i do if he &apos;s home ?
do you want me to kill him fast ,
or do you want him to suffer ?
and by that , i mean , do you want me to hold him
while you ask him why he didn &apos;t call ?
he &apos;s not home .
according to this instagram , he &apos;s at chipotle
talking to a guy with a parrot on his shoulder .
he had no time to pop off a text to me .
oh , it &apos;s stuck and i can &apos;t fit my boobs through there .
i can barely fit them through the holland tunnel .
fine . i &apos;m going in .
finally , having no boobs pays off .
lift my legs up .
okay , but your legs in the air
kind of got you here to begin with .
uh @-@ oh .
what oh ?
i don &apos;t remember him having a floral duvet .
or a bedside toilet .
or a dog . pull me out ! pull me out !
you &apos;ve got to read my book .
i have a whole chapter on pulling out .
no , no , no , no , no ! oh , stop licking me .
buster ? buster ?
someone &apos;s coming .
someone &apos;s coming , you &apos;re getting licked ?
maybe you are in the right apartment .
get out of my house ! get out of my house !
no , no . this is a big mistake .
ben , call the cops !
we got another crack addict here !
we don &apos;t have crack here !
we don &apos;t have crack here !
and tell your friends !
if these match the prints found at an arby &apos;s break @-@ in in &apos; 07,
it &apos;s purely coincidental .
i can &apos;t believe this is happening to me .
my life is over .
look at the camera .
i &apos;m so humiliated .
and turn to the side .
ma &apos;am , this isn &apos;t &quot; vogue : behind bars . &quot;
sorry , officer , she &apos;s a virgin .
me , myself ,
spent some time in the juvie system up in providence .
you know a family court judge named shelly ?
no .
go .
officer , hold .
thanks , but stay away during the full @-@ body cavity search .
proceed .
you think ?
so you girls broke into an old lady &apos;s house ,
got halfway through the window ,
and stole absolutely nothing .
glad i am protecting the city from you .
i mean , isis who , right ?
all right . let &apos;s go .
if he had just texted me , none of this would be happening .
i wouldn &apos;t be in prison , i &apos;d be home .
my other prison .
uh , wait , if who had texted you ?
thanks for asking .
this guy i slept with didn &apos;t text me
for two weeks after we had sex ,
and i left my rings at his place , so i--
you did the two @-@ week rule ?
yeah .
but she got the wrong apartment because , knowing her ,
her eyes were closed the whole time .
well , why didn &apos;t you say so ?
we got a two @-@ week rule over here !
stay right over here .
we &apos;ll get you out soon .
i left my billy club at the captain &apos;s house .
he &apos;s got three more days .
see ? see ?
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
we &apos;ll just chill here for an hour .
it &apos;s like an edgier lens crafters .
what am i gonna tell my father ?
a prisoned prison call ?
i can &apos;t be here .
i can &apos;t be here !
no ! no ! come back ! we were good !
dumb move .
dumber than me and the captain .
let me guess , our glasses won &apos;t be ready in an hour .
i can &apos;t believe you got us arrested in jail .
where are we going ?
i mean , besides nowhere in life .
you girls lost your get @-@ out @-@ of @-@ jail @-@ free card .
you &apos;re gonna have to get someone to bail you out .
you &apos;re going in the holding cell .
yo ! fresh meat !
sorry , i have a reputation to uphold .

yo ! she &apos;s already my bitch !
so she can &apos;t be anyone else &apos;s . sorry .

由五个不同肤色的女人担当主持 深受女性观众的喜爱
max , i can &apos;t handle this .
i can &apos;t handle this .
i couldn &apos;t even watch : the green mile .
relax . this is play @-@ jail .
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re doing real time .
just put on your game face .
i don &apos;t have a game face .
unless the game is &quot; i give up , my life is over , &quot;
then this will do .
well , do something ,
because that &apos;s about to get wiped off your face
by the bruiser covered in tattoos
making her way to us right now .
you guys signing up for the talent show ?
excuse me ?
yeah . some of us have been in here for days ,
due to prison overcrowding .
so the guards let us put on a show .
as long as nobody dies .
wow , prison has changed .
maybe i have a norman rockwell idea of prison ,
其大部分的画作都有点过于甜美乐观
but , uh , what happened to shanking a snitch in the food line ?
oh , a talent show , that &apos;s not scary at all .
you know , i won my yacht club talent show
three years in a row , in the 10 to 13 division .
that &apos;s crazy !
i &apos;m looking at 10 to 13 for grand theft auto .
where are my manners ?
i &apos;m tanaya .
i &apos;m max . this is caroline .
but you can call us by our gang names ,
white lightning and the blade .
sophie , i need you to bail me and caroline out jail .
we got charged with breaking and entering ,
which is also what caroline let a guy do to her ,
and that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
oh , jeez , max .
i mean , that &apos;s a tough call .
i mean , i don &apos;t know if i can .
yeah , it &apos;s really not my thing .
you know , man ?
i get it . i deserved that .
i said no to you , so you &apos;re saying no to me .
like the old saying , &quot; tit for bigger tat . &quot;
yeah . hmm .
all right , let &apos;s see .
uh , i would bail my maid of honor out of jail .
fine . fine .
i &apos;ll be your maid of honor .
i &apos;ll buy you penis straws ,
and those glasses where the nose is a penis .
yeah ! and the penis @-@ shaped pasta ?
i &apos;ll do it all .
i can handle the slammer ,
but caroline doesn &apos;t stand a chance .
i saw a woman looking at her
like she was a cartoon pork chop .
okay . well , i &apos;ll see you soon .
and watch your back .
oh , you know what ?
it &apos;s a ladies &apos; prison , so ...
watch your front .
is this your card ?
no .
yes !
yes , that &apos;s my card .
amazing .
okay . what &apos;d i miss ?
the magic show and the improv troupe .
they asked the audience for a word .
i said , &quot; help . &quot;
sophie &apos;s coming down with bail money ,
as soon as her turkey is out of the oven .
so 4 , 4.1 / 2 hours , depending on the stuffing .
thank god .
wait . bail for both of us , right ?
that wasn &apos;t her original offer .
but after some negotiating , we got there .
what did you have to do to--
max , you didn &apos;t agree to--
yup .
picture me in something low @-@ cut and peach .
a slutty peach .
you &apos;d do that for me ?
i &apos;m touched and shocked .
i thought you &apos;d have forgotten me , had sex with the door guard ,
and been halfway across the parking lot by now .
yeah , well , he wasn &apos;t into me , so ...
walk of shame , party of two .
girls , i heard you got locked up .
yup . we have to do 30 hours of community service .
and caroline won six minutes of privacy on the toilet
in the talent show .
well , not so private .
i had to tinkle while a woman in work boots
made heavy eye @-@ contact .
i went to prison once for
being at the wrong place at the wrong time .
meaning , i was down south .
美国南方对黑人歧视十分严重
look who &apos;s back from the big house .
every house is a big house for you , han .
watch your step , ex @-@ con ,
or i &apos;ll get them to haul you back in
for impersonating a waitress .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying this , but i missed this place .
when i was up in the pen , doing time with my girl , tanaya--
well , orange you the new black ?
so did you two have fun in ladies &apos; prison ?
and tell me , is it anything like the 17 xxx movies
i have with that title ?
okay , so i lost two of my best rings .
so i &apos;m out $ 11 .
i realized i &apos;m tougher than i thought .
i sang in prison . i had a one @-@ night stand .
i &apos;m practically johnny cash .
well , johnny no cash .
