第二十二集
hi , m &apos;lady .
i mean , uh , violet .
i miss you .
swan ?
how are you here ?
zeus-- he must have sent me back .
and this isn &apos;t going to kill you ,
it &apos;s going to end you .
no !
this is my kingdom .
to robin !
? to robin .
regina .
look , i know that there &apos;s nothing we can really say ,
but we just want you to know ...
you don &apos;t have to go through this alone .
she won &apos;t have to .
i think what my sister needs is a little time
with someone who understands what she &apos;s going through .
zelena , we &apos;re sorry .
what happened with hades , that ...
can &apos;t exactly be easy .
we &apos;ll leave you two alone .
henry .
violet .
i &apos;m sorry about robin .
thank you .
when i heard ? you went to the underworld ,
i was afraid ? i was never gonna see you again .
you were ?
me , too .
when we get to granny &apos;s ,
i think it &apos;s best if you wait outside .
aye . regina .
robin &apos;s death -- it can &apos;t be easy for her .
and seeing you back when that &apos;s not possible for him ?
fate is cruel .
it could push her over the edge .
she cursed an entire kingdom when she lost her first love .
yeah , but she &apos;s changed much since then .
i know .
but i still need to break the news about you carefully .
it &apos;s the right thing to do .
belle , since your father refused to wake you ,
i &apos;m gonna have to find another way , and i will .
it &apos;s not just you i have to worry about now .
it &apos;s our family , our unborn child .
there &apos;s only one way i can free you both .
i need more power .
i need all of it .
regina .
emma , please .
i &apos;ve already had enough people feeling sorry for me today .
i know .
i just think we should talk somewhere quiet .
it &apos;s kind of delicate .
what the hell was that ?
swan !
is everything okay ?
hook .
what the bloody hell &apos;s the pirate doing here ?
we thought we left you in the underworld .
aye , you did . but now i &apos;m back .
delicate , as always .
regina .
i &apos;m used to suffering , swan ,
and i &apos;m used ? to others getting their way .
right now , neither one of our feelings matter .
given that blast of magic ,
there &apos;s only one person not present
who &apos;s powerful enough for something like that .
gold .
he &apos;s got the olympian crystal ,
or part of it , anyway .
some of it must have survived .
i can still feel the aura from it .
yeah , you &apos;re not the only one .
he used it ? to cast a tethering spell .
tethering spell ?
what was gold attaching the crystal to ?
storybrooke &apos;s magic .
that &apos;s why he cast a spell here .
with that crystal , he can harness
all of this town &apos;s magic for his own purpose .
gold already has ? the power of all the dark ones .
why does he need more ?
to wake belle .
true love &apos;s kiss didn &apos;t work
because she doesn &apos;t want to be with him .
aye , and once the crocodile wakes belle ,
do you think he &apos;ll stop there ?
do you think he &apos;ll just
turn the bloody crystal and all of its power over to us ?
he &apos;s right . let &apos;s go get that crystal .
let &apos;s .
where should we start ?
actually , um ...
i was thinking maybe you should sit this one out .
oh , that &apos;s why you were trying to be delicate with me .
you &apos;re worried the evil queen is about to come out to play .
no , i just want what &apos;s best for you .
no , you don &apos;t .
when you &apos;re upset , we follow you to hell .
but when i &apos;m upset , i get a time @-@ out .
okay .
you &apos;re not in any state to think straight about this .
and you don &apos;t get to tell me what to do .
moms , please .
? henry , now &apos;s not the time .
maybe just take a minute to cool off and think about it .
you don &apos;t want my help . fine .
i &apos;ll fix this on my own .
kid ... go to my place and stay there .
you &apos;ll be safe , okay ?
we got this .
i mean it , henry . go right home .
henry .
what &apos;s -- what &apos;s going on ? i got your text .
it &apos;s my grandpa .
he &apos;s trying to steal storybrooke &apos;s magic .
it made me realize how bad it is .
it &apos;s always magic . always .
magic turned my mom into a dark one ,
it took away the man my other mom loved ,
and now ...
now i think it &apos;s gonna tear my parents apart .
i used to think ? there was light and dark magic ,
but it &apos;s all bad .
look around this shop .
these -- these are geppetto &apos;s parents .
this needle has put dozens of people under a curse
they can &apos;t wake from ,
and this -- an entire village is frozen in there .
it &apos;s hurt so many people .
my mother ...
that &apos;s how she died -- magic .
come with me on a road trip .
i @-@ it &apos;s like a quest , but on a bus ,
which is like a horse , but with wheels and seats .
j @-@ just -- just come with me .
what do you say ? i think i can fix this .
my father would probably kill me .
b @-@ but yes . of course i &apos;ll come .
great . great .
we &apos;ll call it &quot; operation mixtape . &quot;
there &apos;s just one more thing we &apos;re going to need .
i promised i &apos;d never use this pen
to do anything ? besides record what happens ,
but what we &apos;re about to do is for the greater good .
what &apos;s that ?
the crystal my grandpa tethered storybrooke &apos;s magic to .
wait , i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t understand . you said magic is bad .
why are we going to take it out of storybrooke ?
to destroy it .
once and for all .
so far , no sign of gold ,
which means we need to expand our search perimeter
to include the woods .
where is he ?
i told you . ? we got this . we &apos;ll find gold .
not gold . henry .
&quot; mom , there &apos;s only one way
to fix everything that &apos;s tearing us apart .
i have to destroy -- &quot; - &quot; the source of all of our problems . &quot;
i got the same text .
what does he mean ? what is the source of all of our problems ?
what is he going to destr ...
well , i think i can answer that .
the olympian crystal and all the magic tethered to it .
it would appear my grandson has outsmarted us all ,
used his authorial power
to steal the crystal right out from under my nose .
would henry even do that -- destroy magic ?
we &apos;d better hope he doesn &apos;t .
why ? what happens if henry succeeds ?
considering this town was built with magic ,
what do you think will happen ?
he would never destroy magic if he knew it could hurt us .
i &apos;ll be sure to tell him that
right before i take the crystal back .
don &apos;t you dare go near my son .
sorry , dearie , ? but he &apos;s threatening me now .
regina , where are you going ?
i just lost robin . i &apos;m not about to lose henry , too .
i know , but we have to be smart about this .
gold doesn &apos;t know where henry is any more than we do .
we ?
i don &apos;t remember inviting you to come along .
you benched me . now i bench you .
even if i knew how to find henry ?
all right , sheriff swan ...
where is he ?
you think after ? all those times he ran away ,
i wouldn &apos;t put a gps app on his phone ?
let &apos;s get to the bug . we have to catch up to him .
where &apos;s he headed ?
boston .
is it true ? magic might disappear ?
only if henry destroys the crystal .
which he won &apos;t , not with emma and regina searching for him .
yeah , but what if they don &apos;t find him in time ?
how are we gonna get back without magic ?
it won &apos;t be a problem if we send you home now .
we ?
i think you mean me , dear .
but this time , summon the portal without the twister ?
you heroes ruin all the fun .
very well .
he wasn &apos;t on the bus ?
lady , i don &apos;t know what to tell you . everyone got off .
then why does the gps tracker still say he &apos;s on it ?
because henry hid his phone under one of the seats .
he wanted us to think he came to boston .
ladies , if you don &apos;t mind , it &apos;s my lunch .
got any more bright ideas ?
regina --
well ... that &apos;s new .
how &apos;s that even possible ? we &apos;re in the land without magic .
and so is henry , with the crystal .
and all of the magic from storybrooke .
regina , if our magic works out here ,
gold &apos;s magic works out here .
we &apos;ve got to find henry before he does .
well , if he &apos;s not in boston , then where is he ?
i thought the spires of camelot were tall .
welcome to new york city .
are you sure regina won &apos;t mind us leaving without a goodbye ?
she &apos;ll understand .
robin would want him to grow up in sherwood forest .
we &apos;ll come and visit you soon , okay ?
and we &apos;ll even bring your baby sister .
for regina .
from one of my papa &apos;s arrows .
how sweet .
she &apos;ll cherish it .
that &apos;s everyone .
let &apos;s close it up .
what &apos;s happening ? !
stand back !
zelena !
it must have something to do
with magic being tied to that bloody crystal !
everyone okay ?
for now . look .
well , we &apos;re certainly not in storybrooke anymore .
? there has to be something in here that belongs to henry .
i assume you have a map somewhere in this pigsty of yours .
in the glove box .
by the way , it was your idea to go to hardee &apos;s .
give me your hand .
why ? what is that ?
what ?
worried i might make you take an eternal nap on a bus bench ?
if you want to help henry ,
you &apos;re just gonna have to trust me .
? now that there &apos;s magic in the world ...
this just might work .
and if it does , you &apos;re going to lead us right to him .
of course . new york .
i hope gold doesn &apos;t know that yet .
welcome to new york . it &apos;ll be $ 15 .
i can &apos;t imagine living here .
it &apos;s overwhelming .
i thought the same thing when i first went to camelot ,
until you showed me around .
well , i want to see this place , henry , truly ,
but -- but what does it have to do with destroying magic ?
it &apos;s got to do with my dad .
magic ? tore apart his family , too ,
when my grandpa became the dark one .
and did he want to destroy magic , too ?
the truth is , for a really long time .
no one else knows this , not even my moms .
he made me promise not to tell anyone .
it &apos;s safe with me , i promise .
see , that &apos;s why he was in new york .
he was trying to find a way to protect himself
in case his dad found him .
right , and he thought the best way of doing that
was by destroying magic .
did he ever figure it out ?
he died before he could , but i know he got close .
he kept everything he found in a journal .
it &apos;s got to be in my dad &apos;s apartment .
come on .
if this isn &apos;t storybrooke or the enchanted forest ,
then where are we ?
well , wherever we are ,
i &apos;d rather not stick around long enough to find out .
can you ... use the wand and get us back to storybrooke ?
not quite .
so we &apos;re trapped in this mysterious realm ,
wherever it is .
you can fix it , right ?
of course .
do you happen to have any duct tape ?
we &apos;re not affixing the bumper to that god @-@ awful truck of yours .
this requires the proper potions ,
none of which i have with me .
well , then we &apos;re just gonna have to go find them .
then we &apos;ll have to move quickly .
if we don &apos;t find regina and emma before henry destroys magic ,
fixing this wand won &apos;t matter .
we &apos;ll be cut off from storybrooke for good .
hold on , i hear something .
excuse me .
can you tell us what land we &apos;re in ?
no need to run !
please don &apos;t hurt me .
we just want to know what land we &apos;re in .
i &apos;m not supposed to talk to strangers .
it &apos;s okay .
you don &apos;t need to be afraid of us .
no , you don &apos;t understand .
you shouldn &apos;t be here . you have to go .
well , that &apos;s what we want to do .
we &apos;re trying to get home to our families ,
to a town called storybrooke ?
that &apos;s a s @-@ strange name .
we need magic to get back there . can you help us ?
magic ? n @-@ no , no , no . m @-@ magic is dangerous .
if i help you , i &apos;ll be punished .
punished ? by who ?
by me .
i guess now we know what that groundsman was so afraid of .
this isn &apos;t like ? any dungeon i &apos;ve ever seen .
these bars are enchanted .
magic won &apos;t get us out of here .
what about the wand ? do you still have it ?
should i be offended that he didn &apos;t frisk me ?
not that this ? is any use to us in here .
? hid it . someone &apos;s coming .
there you are .
the prisoners who attacked my groundsman .
no , no , no . we didn &apos;t attack anyone .
this is just a big misunderstanding .
we just want to know where we are .
all you need to know
is that you don &apos;t want to be here ,
and that you &apos;re the ones
who are going to be answering my questions .
like why are you really here ?
we just want to go home .
you must think me so naive .
i know you &apos;re lying .
i know who really sent you .
so tell me ...
what does the dark one want ?
you know the bloody crocodile ?
who are you ? what do you really want ?
don &apos;t lie to me .
he &apos;s too strong .
look , we get it . you &apos;re powerful .
but killing him ? isn &apos;t gonna change the truth ,
which is that we don &apos;t work for rumplestiltskin .
he &apos;s our enemy .
he &apos;s the whole reason we &apos;re here .
he tried to steal magic from our town to wake the woman he loves .
she &apos;s ...
... pregnant .
you expect me to believe that the dark one has found love ?
yes .
so whatever grudge you have against him ,
we have nothing to do with it .
let us go , and you won &apos;t have to worry about us ever again .
in my experience ,
if you really don &apos;t want to worry about something ,
you lock it into a cage --
a strong cage , like this one .
it &apos;s when you unlock the cage ...
... that &apos;s when the trouble starts .
looks like henry was here , but i don &apos;t think he was alone .
this is , uh , henry and violet &apos;s song .
they have a song ?
he really likes her . she &apos;s a nice girl .
you &apos;re just saying that because you feel bad
about ripping her heart out in camelot .
i &apos;ll like her a lot better
when i know where she &apos;s taken my son .
well , i think i might be able to figure that out .
yes . ? he has definitely been here .
he tried to wipe ? the search history clean .
luckily , i can get it back .
i won &apos;t hold my breath .
maybe there &apos;s something else in here
that can tell us where they &apos;ve gone .
did you find something ?
one of robin &apos;s books .
he must have brought it with him
from storybrooke when he came here .
i know because i gave it to him .
it &apos;s a collection of this world &apos;s
legends about robin hood .
he used to laugh ? at everything they got wrong .
what is it ? are you okay ?
it &apos;s a letter from robin to me .
he must have written it
when he was trying ? to make things work with marian .
or your sister .
so what do i do ?
you have to read it .
&quot; my dear regina , i know i shouldn &apos;t be writing this ,
but i had to let you know how proud i am of you .
you opened your heart to love and let it change you .
and no matter what separates us , i know you &apos;ll always be
the heroine woman i fell in love with -- robin . &quot;
regina ? you okay ? what did it say ?
please , emma ,
if you &apos;re gonna try to make me feel better , don &apos;t .
no , i know that i can &apos;t , and i won &apos;t .
i &apos;m ...
sorry about earlier .
i was so wrapped up worrying about how you &apos;d react to hook ,
i ...
i wasn &apos;t there for you about robin .
you want to know why i got so angry ?
because you &apos;re right .
the evil queen ...
is inside me ...
always trying to get out .
i can &apos;t expect you to get it .
well , i fought the darkness .
you know i do understand .
all due respect , but you don &apos;t .
you went up to the precipice .
but you got pulled back before it consumed you .
i was consumed .
and i have to live with it every day .
i can &apos;t imagine how that feels .
it &apos;s exhausting .
i &apos;m constantly at war with my instincts .
like with hook .
my first impulse ...
was to rip his throat out
because it &apos;s not fair that he survives and robin doesn &apos;t .
but i didn &apos;t .
because now i know that &apos;s wrong .
much as i want to give in to evil , i don &apos;t .
so i do good ...
and hate every moment of it .
you hate doing good ?
yes .
it &apos;s complicated .
i know it &apos;s right , but it always leads to loss for me .
yet i keep doing it now , and i keep suffering .
but i know the evil queen can &apos;t return , so ...
that &apos;s how it has to be .
i &apos;ll never be at peace with myself .
that &apos;s not true .
you fell in love with robin , and you were happy .
yeah , and look what happened .
i am what i am .
i did what i did .
many years ago , i had a choice .
snow white told a secret .
and i could have chosen to forgive her .
instead ...
i did terrible things .
unspeakable things .
that will always hang over me .
i &apos;ve tried to be the hero .
and you have been .
what if it doesn &apos;t matter ?
there &apos;s no redemption for me .
there &apos;s only suffering .
because now i have a curse .
the curse of knowing the difference between good and evil .
and i &apos;m caught between them .
if i revert , i lose everyone i love .
henry ...
my friends ...
everyone .
and if i go forward trying to be good ,
i have to live with my past darkness
and all its ? well @-@ deserved consequences .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i believe in you .
that &apos;s because ...
you are good .
but for me , ? it &apos;s a simple choice , really .
i &apos;d rather suffer
than see that pain ? on the people i care about .
this is my fate .
i &apos;m trapped .
he &apos;s at the midtown library .
what are they doing there ?
you want to go to the rare reading room ? really ?
well , here we are .
no one &apos;s been back here in ages .
most folks just come for the y.a. stuff .
well , good luck with your term paper .
my dad &apos;s journal said he had an appointment here .
whatever he was looking for to destroy magic
must be in this room .
start with these .
read every page and then re @-@ read it .
because whatever my dad was looking for ,
he never found it .
and you really think we can ?
we have to .
that &apos;s impossible .
henry , w @-@ what did you find ?
these books , they all look exactly like my story book .
they &apos;re magic . what are they doing in new york ?
i &apos;ve never seen ? these characters in my book .
look at this . there are so many stories .
? wait , henry , you told me
that all the stories in your book are real .
yeah .
so maybe ...
these are all real , too .
you all right ?
aye . bloody fantastic .
other than that , even in this hellish land ,
the bloody crocodile manages to get in my way .
what the devil do you think he did to that warden ?
well , with him , it could be anything .
get ready . someone &apos;s coming .
okay .
let &apos;s do this .
there you are .
what are you doing here ?
what does it look like ? i &apos;m here to help you .
help us ? last time , you wouldn &apos;t even talk to us .
that &apos;s because the warden was watching me .
i had no choice .
if you really want to help us ,
prove it -- open those bloody bars .
i can &apos;t .
his orderly , poole , keeps the key with him at all times .
i might be able to get the magic you need ...
if you &apos;ll make a promise to me first .
tell us . anything .
when you leave this place ,
promise you &apos;ll take me with you back to your home .
to storybrooke ? why ?
because i wasn &apos;t always the gardener here .
i @-@ i @-@ i was a doctor ,
b @-@ before the warden took control and ruined everything .
he -- he made me a prisoner .
look , we need magic so i can fix this wand .
i @-@ i know exactly where to go .
the hospital lab , but ...
i can &apos;t take anything
without the warden ? knowing that it &apos;s missing .
you &apos;ll have to give the pieces to me so i can fix it there .
then i &apos;ll bring them back .
please understand , ? that wand is our only way home .
okay , so why should we trust you ?
you &apos;ve met the warden .
trust me , i want to get away from him as much as you do .
this is a bad plan .
it &apos;s the only one we &apos;ve got .
now i see why my dad gave up .
there &apos;s nothing in here about destroying magic .
we came all this way for nothing .
not for nothing .
you &apos;ll figure it out .
henry !
henry , i know why your dad never finished his quest .
it &apos;s because he never visited camelot .
back in camelot ,
my tutor used to show me paintings of the holy grail .
he said it was the source of all magic .
and it looked just like that .
but the grail turned into excalibur . that can &apos;t be it .
no , the grail ? was always silver , but ...
this looks kind of like it-- it-- its twin .
and if the grail really was the beginning of all magic ...
this might be the end of it .
yeah .
stand back .
why ? what are you gonna --
you were right .
this will destroy magic .
so what do we do now ? what -- what happens next ?
whatever it is , ? it &apos;s not safe to do here .
hello , henry .
violet , get behind me .
you &apos;re not getting this .
not without a fight .
too bad you &apos;re gonna lose .
what are you doing in here ?
the w @-@ w @-@ warden wanted me to fix this .
it &apos;s a surgical instrument .
well , if that &apos;s true ,
you won &apos;t mind me asking the warden himself .
no . you can &apos;t do that .
you know he -- ? he doesn &apos;t like to be disturbed .
now , like i said ...
it &apos;s time to see the warden .
why am i here ?
sorry to disturb you .
the doctor was in his lab fixing a wand
i can only imagine ? he got from the prisoners .
and so you did this ?
the doctor was running away .
i -- i had no choice .
but you know the rules .
no one hurts dr. jekyll .
except me .
oh , what a mess .
the doctor hasn &apos;t been brave enough to come down here
for quite some time .
he must think that these prisoners can help him .
should we kill them just to be safe ?
i would be happy to do it .
oh , yes , i &apos;m sure you would be .
the fact is , if the doctor is on to something ,
this place that they told him about , this storybrooke ...
could be the answer we &apos;re looking for .
you mean it ?
you think this could be the place ?
i think that we have been trapped in this land
for far too long .
it &apos;s time that we found ourselves a home .
and so ...
i shall allow the doctor to go through with his plan ,
but i &apos;m going to make one small alteration .
the doctor isn &apos;t the only one
who will be going to this storybrooke .
we all will .
henry ! are you okay ?
mom , where &apos;s violet ?
i &apos;m right here . i &apos;m all right .
what happened to you ? to -- to both of you ?
grandpa . he has the crystal now .
henry , what were you thinking ?
why would you try to destroy magic ?
do you really have to ask me that ?
you finally ? had a chance to be happy ,
and then magic took it away from you ,
just like with daniel .
henry , the evil queen is never coming back .
you don &apos;t have to worry about me .
i don &apos;t , because my other mom is doing that for me .
you thought she was gonna go all evil queen again .
i &apos;m sorry . ? i should have trusted regina .
but you didn &apos;t !
because you know how it goes for us .
every time it looks like we could be happy ,
magic just comes in and wrecks it .
is that what you really think ?
yeah .
in case you both forgot , magic took away my dad .
and it took away violet &apos;s mom .
and i don &apos;t know what i would do
if it took away one of you .
henry . ? - don &apos;t !
just don &apos;t .
henry , what were you doing down here ?
following my dad &apos;s trail to figure out how to destroy magic .
but we didn &apos;t find anything .
it was just a waste of time .
so , what do we do now ?
&apos;cause henry &apos;s grandpa has the crystal .
well , we have to find him .
give me your hand .
is this really gonna help find him ?
this will tell us ? if he &apos;s still in new york .
why isn &apos;t it working ?
our magic , it &apos;s gone .
the crystal .
gold must have done something to it .
what the hell is he doing ?
he &apos;s not gonna give that magic back to anyone .
he &apos;s gonna keep it all for himself .
well , we &apos;re gonna have to do it the old @-@ fashioned way .
you &apos;re summoning the portal ?
is this how we get to this ...
this storybrooke ?
no , for what we &apos;re after , you need to think bigger .
then what are we doing ?
taking something
that will give us the power we need .
now , when i wake you ,
i think you &apos;ll finally understand
that everything i &apos;ve done ,
i &apos;ve done for you and our child .
and then ,
i &apos;m gonna give you what you always wanted , belle .
i &apos;m gonna show you the world .
a portal .
belle !
belle !
belle ?
belle ?
oh , no !
oh , no .
i don &apos;t understand .
how is this box gonna help us find a home ?
it &apos;s not the box that &apos;s important .
it &apos;s what &apos;s inside it .
or rather , who .
if the dark one ever wishes to see his wife again ...
... he &apos;ll have to do exactly as i say .
