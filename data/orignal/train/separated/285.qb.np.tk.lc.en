pick up ... chicken breasts .
the way i know you want it , with the bone in .
we really should hold a seminar about sexual harassment in the workplace .
why ? he &apos;s already so good at it .
i &apos;m serious . how &apos;d he like it
if we did that to him every time we ordered ?
well , let &apos;s find out .
ordering .
one pastrami .
can you do me a favor , doll @-@ face ?
make it so big and thick , you can &apos;t get your mouth around it .
can you do that for me , sweetheart ?
yes , and two matzo ball soups ,
hold the balls .
wait , i &apos;ll hold the balls ,
you just sit there and look pretty .
and a cream of ...
nope , can &apos;t . just grossed myself out .
when is it going to get dirty ?
max , come out .
if i came out , it would not be for you ,
it &apos;s be for that hot dragon tattoo girl .
welcome , board members , to the very first
financial assessment meeting of max &apos;s homemade cupcakes .
i was told there would be a cheese plate .
after five months in business ,
we &apos;re showing a profit of $ 725 .
i have to say , i &apos;m a little disappointed .
really ? &apos; cause , dude , we have so far exceeded
where i thought we &apos;d be in five months .
look , we have to find a way to make more money on the side
to put into the business .
or we could quit now , while we &apos;re a success .
what are you talking about ?
it &apos;s only gonna get worse .
or it could get better . why would you even say that ?
because it &apos;s life , and life gets worse , that &apos;s what it does .
on life &apos;s resume , under special skills it says ,
&quot; good at making things worse . &quot;
do you always go to the worst @-@ case scenario ?
yup . on my resume it says ,
&quot; good at going to the worst case scenario . &quot;
do you think you could try to be more optimistic ,
and not expect the worst all the time ?
who &apos;s that ?
more optimistic , right ?
on the other side of that door is all the money you lost ,
and then we move back into your townhouse ,
and i masturbate in your tub for a change .
it was twice , and you could have knocked .
who is it ?
detective james , nypd .
wait , don &apos;t open it ! don &apos;t open it !
oh , smoked it tuesday . open .
sorry to bother you , miss . do you live in this apartment ?
i &apos;m gonna tell you right now , officer ,
our names aren &apos;t on the lease .
we &apos;re an illegal sublet with no place else to go .
please , mercy .
sorry , officer , it &apos;s her first raid .
relax , the landlord didn &apos;t send me .
what do you know about the tenant
who lives in the apartment directly above you ?
his name is lou .
leo ?
saul ?
am i even close ?
his name &apos;s nirham chaduri .
oh , man , i wasn &apos;t even on the right continent .
is that nirham chaduri ?
been dead for two weeks . lived alone , nobody knew .
cats eat his face ?
max , could you please not be so dark ?
kittens eat his face ?
what ? i &apos;m just trying to put a more positive spin on things .
where are you going with that ?
that &apos;s my good china with huckleberry hound on it .
i &apos;m making a &quot; hello &quot; cupcake plate
for our neighbors across the hall .
oh , no , you &apos;re not .
it &apos;s weird not to know your neighbors .
no , it &apos;s weird not to know your father ,
but by the time you &apos;re four , you get over it and move on .
this is a mistake .
who knows what &apos;s lurking behind that door ?
yes , something awful ,
like nice people , who might look out for us ,
or say , &quot; hello , &quot; in the hallway when they see you .
no matter what comes out of there ,
i will not be &quot; hello @-@ ing &quot; it up in the hallway .
you got lucky . get back in here .
who is it , please ?
caroline , your next @-@ door neighbor .
hi .
uh , is this a bad time ?
not at all .
one sec .
hi .
i just wanted to introduce myself and my roommate , max .
there , and give you these cupcakes .
that is so nice .
well , it &apos;s the leash ... least ... least i can do .
well , i gotta go .
well , if we ever get a dog , we know who can walk it .
listen .
i know .
it &apos;s only been a few days ,
and somebody &apos;s already moved in upstairs .
and they are playing music !
music is coming through the floor into my ears .
i blame you for this .
when you knocked on that door across the hall ,
you might have opened a portal to hell .
there , you hear the devil music ?
i think it &apos;s the bee gees .
exactly .
and walking !
walking and music , we have to stop this right now .
it &apos;s 10 o &apos;clock , people are allowed to walk and play music .
your lack of apartment knowledge
is really starting to piss me off .
we have to show him right now not to screw us .
i need paper .
what are you doing ? i mean , besides over @-@ reacting ?
writing a threatening note .
if we don &apos;t shut this down now , next thing you know ,
someone &apos;s having an academy awards party in your living room .
is that what you want ?
strangers passing out mini oscar statues
that say , &quot; best nachos ? &quot;
&quot; i have an unregistered gun
and can shoot you through the floor &quot; ?
you &apos;re coming in really hot , max .
we &apos;re not giving him this .
it &apos;ll start a bad dynamic between us .
god , how i miss the quiet , dead indian guy .
okay , we &apos;re gonna hit and run .
oh , you mean &quot; run , &quot; literally .
shh , listen .
reading the note ,
freaking out ...
music off , problem solved .
respect ! never doubt , never doubt .
crossing the floor to the door ,
closing the door ,
coming down the stairs ,
what do we do ?
move ?
what &apos;s he look like ?
he &apos;s got his finger over the peephole .
okay , game on . back up !
this is my building , i &apos;ve got to take it back .
max , this is life ,
not call of duty : modern warfare 3 .
move .
what !
what is meaning of this horrible , horrible note ?
oh , you &apos;re not a man ?
what kind of question is this ?
do i look like a man ?
no , but you clump around up there like a man .
max , please .
did you write this horrible , horrible note ?
i did .
first day in my new home
and i &apos;m given this horrible , horrible note , with threats .
well , they &apos;re not actually threats .
&quot; i will gut you like a hog . &quot;
to be clear , i only skimmed the note .
everything was happening so fast .
listen , we &apos;ve obviously gotten off to a bad start .
please come in .
why would i want to come in with you horrible , horrible ...
ooh , cupcake land . ooh .

yes .
i visited warsaw once , i love it .
oh , &apos; cause i hate it . rats and pimps .
why have you not yet offered me cupcake ?
it &apos;s the least thing you can do , after horrible , horrible note .
oh , sure . chocolate or vanilla ?
yes .
why such sourpuss ?
sorry about that .
it &apos;s just , we work long hours at the neighborhood diner ,
and max has another job as well ,
and then she comes home and she has to make the cupcakes .
mmm . so good .
how could someone so angry
make something so sweet ?
she &apos;s not always like this .
i &apos;m usually like this , just ask the previous tenant .
oh , wait . you can &apos;t .
you know , you two girls are like these cupcakes .
one is dark and heavy and one is light and fluffy .
i prefer the fluffy one .
well , i think we &apos;ve made our point .
no music , no clumping ,
i &apos;ll shoot you through the floor , thanks for stopping by .
i &apos;m so glad we can joke with each other already .
sorry about the note , can we start ov ...
you have the chanel allure lip gloss ?
yeah .
mm , you know the chanel ?

hey , we start again .

oh , sure .
yes .
i knew it . bitch played us for cupcakes .
it &apos;s 3 : 00 a.m. why are you dressed ?
never took off my clothes , &apos; cause soldiers don &apos;t .
we have to be ready when the enemy attacks .
okay , you were right , i was wrong .
why do you have the broom ?
&apos;cause i ran out of finger bullets .
wait , you &apos;re gonna fall .
i can &apos;t believe we have a broom .
all this time i &apos;ve been sweeping with an us weekly .
i knew this would happen , but i didn &apos;t say anything ,
&apos;cause you were all , &quot; max is the worst @-@ case scenario . &quot;
well , we showed weakness and now , look .
and by &quot; we , &quot; i mean &quot; you . &quot;
deal with this , cupcake thief !
yeah , one more time , and hard .
okay , now she broke our house . we &apos;re in a war .
she wants a piece of me , she &apos;s gonna get it .
where are my heels ?
i mean , who did she think i am ?
someone she can just buy off with a tube of chanel ?
well , your legs did kind of snap back
over your head pretty quick when she offered it .
i thought you were man with pizza .
you have a porch swing in there .
you have an electric cigarette .
what is it you two girls want ?
uh , i forgot .
just so thrown by the swing and the everything .
oh , you &apos;re taking advantage of us
by still playing that music after we talked .
you two are harshing my marshmallow .
so i &apos;m gonna have to call my friend the landlord tomorrow
and tell him about the horrible , horrible note .
oh , my god , she &apos;s a hooker .
i &apos;ve been using a hooker &apos;s lip gloss .
she &apos;s not a hooker .
oh , good .
she &apos;s too old , she &apos;s a madame .
you &apos;ve been using an old hooker &apos;s lip gloss .
max , look , my lip .
is this something ? i feel like i &apos;m getting one .
for the last time , you cannot get a herpes breakout
通常在感染后2到10日爆发
in under ten hours .
you &apos;re right , now i &apos;m jumping to the worst @-@ case scenario .
maybe her lip gloss wasn &apos;t a herpes breeding ground .
maybe she &apos;s not a prostitute .
maybe those young girls weren &apos;t being held there against their will .
yeah , maybe she just has sleepovers
with women on swings in the their nighties .
you know , like people do .
welcome to williamsburg diner .
how many in your party ?
what kind of question is this ?
one , i am my own party .
i take booth .
now , now , who is that over there ?
our new upstairs neighbor .
earl , does she look like a prostitute to you ?
well , i don &apos;t like to judge a book by its cover ,
but if she was a book ,
she &apos;d be the kind that other books pay for sex .
sophie just came in , earl thinks she &apos;s a hooker ,
and now my lip is feeling very courtney love .
i invited her here for a free meal ,
we have to make this work out for us .
last night , she threatened to call her &quot; friend , &quot; the landlord ,
and that can never happen .
we &apos;re illegal tenants ,
and i &apos;d rather have a noisy roof over my head than no roof .
let me do the talking .
you &apos;re too upset , and you might say something insulting .
like what ? &quot; hi , thanks for the lip gloss
and the series of uncomfortable conversations
with every lover i &apos;ll have for the rest of my life . &quot;
you don &apos;t need to tell them ,
they &apos;ll figure it out eventually .
hi , thanks for coming in .
i like the uniforms .
you fill out the front nicely ,
and you with no boobs , short @-@ short skirts .
smart girls .
uh , we just wanted to offer you a free dinner ,
as our way of apologizing .
so are you ready to order ?
what kind of question is this ?
did you see this horrible , horrible menu ?
we can &apos;t have nice conversation here .
tomorrow i take you to nice place , my treat .
oh , you don &apos;t have to do that .
no , no , i , too , want to apologize .
you know , after you two left the other night ,
some of my girls said that i was harsh on you .
your girls ?
yes , all those girls work for me .
excuse me , i have to go to the ladies &apos; room right now
and look at my lips .
thank you so much for inviting us .
are you enjoying that beluga ?
mmm , so much . thank you .
i haven &apos;t had caviar in forever . mmm .
legs over your head much ?
so , sourpuss , you don &apos;t like caviar ?
no , i &apos;m more of a cheeseburger kind of girl .
this place is busy .
the waiters must make a fortune .
oh , yeah , 300 , 350 a night .
what do you girls make ?
60 to 80 on a good night .
and how do you expect you will accomplish cupcake business
on money like this ?
well , we &apos;re just starting out .
yes , but at this rate , it will take forever .
you know , i , too , have big dream .
i am building summer house by lake in poland .
you want to see ?
oh , you have pictures ?
no , i have house .
this is model from the architect .
and i take it everywhere i am , to remember where i &apos;m going .
it &apos;s cool .
see , girls like you should be making more money .
maybe you could consider coming to work for me .
sophie !
thank you for sending girl to my apartment yesterday .
oh , did she do the job ?
oh , like no one ever before .
down on all fours , under , over ,
under again . oh !
well , my girls don &apos;t leave until you &apos;re satisfied .
maybe she can come two times a week .
she can come whenever you want her to come .
are these two of your girls ?
well , we were just discussing that .
well , this one here looks like she can take a lot .
uh , thanks ?
my friend yanni is at the bar .
since his divorce , he &apos;s in great need of your service .
prosze .
oh , yes .
uh , excuse me , and , um , don &apos;t touch my house .
i can &apos;t believe she would actually consider
asking us to be prostitutes .
i know .
i mean , me , i get ,
but you , i don &apos;t see it .
you heard the guy , i look like i could &quot; take a lot . &quot;
max , it &apos;s not funny .
isn &apos;t it bad enough i may have gotten herpes
from her chanel gloss ?
of course we &apos;re not gonna do it ,
but come on , you &apos;d be a terrible hooker .
thank you , i would be a terrible hooker .
i have a heart , and soul , and dreams ,
and want to fall in love and have a family .
oh , just say it , you &apos;re bad in bed .
let &apos;s get out of here .
i mean , really , who does she think i am ?
someone who would just sell myself to have nice things ?
let me just suck down a little more of this , and we &apos;re off .
if we walk out of here now ,
we can just keep walking to the homeless shelter .
well , i &apos;d rather be homeless than a hooker .
here she comes . sit down !
let &apos;s thank her and politely decline .
okay , back to what we were discussing .
uh , thanks .
we appreciate the offer , but we are going to pass .
so you don &apos;t want to accomplish your dream ?
well , uh , i &apos;m not exactly sure those two things line up ,
but thanks .
i thought you were smart girls .
we are smart girls ,
and smart girls don &apos;t have to sell their bodies
to accomplish their goals .
not that there &apos;s anything wrong with that .
it works for you , but us ?
well , she &apos;s bad in bed and i have a sourpuss .
what guy wants to pay for that ?
you think i am prostitute ?
no , everyone has swings with girls in pajamas .
my business card .
home cleaning service .
she runs a cleaning company .

讲波兰姑娘苏菲在纳粹集中营中的故事
you realize what this means ?
we insulted a hard @-@ working woman
who was trying to help us attain our goal ?
yes .
and i don &apos;t have herpes !
i should have listened to you .
meeting neighbors is a big mistake .
and meeting neighbors and calling them a prostitute ?
bigger mistake .
plus , we have to kick in 60 for the check .
what can we possibly say to her ?
that we &apos;re sorry , and please keep playing the bee gees
day or night as loud as she wants .
not a good idea to be smiling right now .
i &apos;m just so happy i don &apos;t have herpes .
hi , is this a bad time ?
yes . yes , i &apos;m in the middle of having sex for money
with every man in brooklyn .
what do you horrible , horrible girls want ?
here , you left part of your dream on the table .
and we want to apologize .
i &apos;m new at this whole being neighborly thing .
what does the fluffy one have to say ?
thank you for being so generous ,
and for offering to help us make more money
to accomplish our dream .
and this is supposed to make me feel better ?
you called me prostitute .
actually , it &apos;s kind of a compliment
that we thought you were stunning enough
that men would pay to have sex with you .
this is true .
come on in .
saturday night fever is my favorite movie .
look at him . he &apos;s so sexy .
he &apos;s not that cute , kind of oily .
