this money has been sitting here since 1998,
not doing anybody any good .
i want to get ralphie something nice .
yeah , a few thousand should do .
uh , you heard me whistling there , right ?
that indicates innocence .

give me a dollar and i &apos;ll stop .
i don &apos;t got a dollar .
do you want to practice your speech on me ?
no need , honey .
same speech i give every year .
the opening joke about lenny &apos;s grandma always kills .
you can &apos;t joke about her--
they just put her on life support .
what ? ! no ! she &apos;s the linchpin !
it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay .
everyone is terrified of public speaking .
but just in case ,
i &apos;ll defrost a failure ham .
you don &apos;t have faith in me ! i have savers .
if i get heckled , i &apos;ll say , &quot; get a half @-@ life ! &quot;

i &apos;m a failure .

now release the real hounds .
it &apos;s a pretty good seminar this year .
dad , what &apos;s wrong ? did your speech go badly ?
how do you know something &apos;s wrong ?
you &apos;re drinking from a can of corn .
我们天堂见
aw , dad , do you know barbra streisand
once forgot the words to a song
and didn &apos;t perform in public again for nearly three decades ?
yeah , but she still had james brolin to cuddle .
so , on a scale of ten to ten , how &apos;d you do ?
drip drop , you flop .

oh , the city cleaned them up and made them comics .
cool !
homie , you &apos;re gonna chuckle your blues away .
this is the best kind of comedy .

74 degrees west longitude .
ah , yes , new york city . now we need a relationship
for me and cathy here .
loveless marriage !
okay , i heard loveless marriage .
these guys are pros .
all they did was ask for two premises .
that &apos;s two more than you &apos;ve asked for .
oh , boy .
all right , all we need now is an object .
anyone .
fear of public speaking
sorry , didn &apos;t hear that .

okay , okay , okay , um ... fear of public speaking .
well , that &apos;s not really an object ,
but we &apos;ll make it work .
new york city , loveless marriage ,
fear of public speaking .

maybe they can teach me .
i don &apos;t know that they &apos;re interested in that .

that &apos;s kind of expensive .
couldn &apos;t people just form their own groups for free ?
and scene .
即兴表演课

improv class ?

this is it .
i feel my mind exploding with premises .
so many ideas ,
but how do i turn them into comedy ?
homer , could @-@ could you stay with us , please ?
i don &apos;t know how .
the secret is to lose yourself
and become , say , a suicidal auctioneer .
i could not possibly imagine what such a person would say .
well , just remember , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s not you .
don &apos;t you get it ? the secret to life
has been right in front of you .

明日安排 : 蟑螂检查 照常营业
i &apos;ve got to hand it to you , dad .
you went from fear of public speaking
to starting your own improv troupe .
improv is exciting ,
but totally safe .
like driving a helicopter on the ground .
um , that &apos;s not safe .
don &apos;t deny the premise .
that &apos;s anti @-@ improv .
note for new character , &quot; auntie improv . &quot;
may i hear a suggestion ?
people , don &apos;t freak out ,
but the improv critic from the springfield shopper
is in the audience .
steve thurlson ?
no , thurlson is their improv reporter .
grant hood is their improv critic .
then who &apos;s jennifer whitehead ?
oh , she writes improv think pieces .
you know , trends , big picture stuff .
who does the top ten list
at end @-@ of @-@ year &quot; best of improv &quot; issue ?
they each write their own .
oh , yeah .
i forgot about that . that &apos;s true .
hi , everybody .
we are &quot; premises , premises . &quot;
yes , it says on google that there are 5,012 improv groups
with that name .

and a type of person that might be there .
someone with confidence .

uh , who was that directed at ?
bart !
pass the gravy , please .
dad ! dad !
the springfield fringe festival just invited us to perform .
huh ? what &apos;s a &quot; fringe festival &quot; ?
my guess would be it &apos;s a three @-@ day series of performances
by alternative comedy and music acts ,
including , but not limited to ,
improv , stand @-@ up , light circus work and ironic burlesque .
we &apos;re gonna be on the main stage on closing night !
this is going in my log .
yay !
more crab for me .
there &apos;s no crab !
aw , marge , don &apos;t take it to heart .
kids are ungrateful , that &apos;s their job .
you can cheer up watching me at the fringe festival .
good for you .
the main stage , closing night , all eyes on you .
wh @-@ wh @-@ wh @-@ what ... what are you saying ?
oh , she &apos;s making me nervous again .
but now i &apos;m a trained comedy amateur .
no one can get in my head .
marge simpson ,
you don &apos;t want to accidentally undermine him like last time .
oh , thank god he doesn &apos;t know what i &apos;m thinking .
i know exactly what she &apos;s thinking .
that if i mess this up , i &apos;ll be worse off than ever .
he does know .
she knows i know !
homer ?
aw , what ?
焦急的苗浩斯正在等待

yeah !
hash browns might be a little burnt .

your mother can &apos;t resist an apology
that comes straight from the heart ...
of this box .
艺穗节

hey , reverend .
why didn &apos;t the dinosaurs make it on noah &apos;s ark ?
ooh , i give up .
because they didn &apos;t exist .
dad , this festival encourages experimentation .
even failure .
oh , what if i don &apos;t fail ?
desperate times call for desperate measures .
i am getting a helium balloon .
that makes anyone funny .
be right back !
homer , are you okay ?
you look exactly like barbara streisand did in 1967 .
i can &apos;t think of anything funny .
homer , homer , relax , you &apos;re a riot .
remember how funny you was when you was the confident cajun ?
look , just let me feed you the prompt .
wait , you mean cheat at improv ?
what would del close say ?
he would say , &quot; do like moe says , and shut the hell up . &quot;
who &apos;s del close ?
only the author of the best book i intend to read someday .
homer , the cemeteries are filled with people
who didn &apos;t cheat at improv .
okay , let &apos;s go over what you &apos;re gonna call out one more time .
ethnicity , cajun .
location , back alley .
good , good .
the back alley cajun bit .
dad !
are you cheating by planting suggestions ?
maybe .
have you learned nothing from owning an unread copy
of truth in comedy ?
it &apos;s either that or quit the show .
you can &apos;t let your troupe down .
they need your space work ,
your strong choices ,
and scene @-@ building skills .
hey , lay off your dad , huh ?
everything that &apos;s supposedly spontaneous
has already been planned , okay ?
reality shows , uh , lip @-@ sync singing , even ...
awards shows .

b @-@ b @-@ b @-@ but they have scheduling conflicts .
