I'm already number one on her hit list.
If Alison finds out I'm siding with you guys,
I'm afraid to think of how far she'd go to stop me.
You think that Alison's "A"?
Hello.
If I try to tell Mike that Mona isn't what he's looking for...
You won't be able to separate them with a crowbar.
I'm Mrs. Grunwald.
Ali was calling Grunwald
because she believed that she could help her.
What kind of help could you give her?
I have a gift of insight.
What's wrong?
My parents want me to come to California after Christmas.
This letter proves Alison knew Bethany.
It could create enough reasonable doubt to clear Spencer.
The investigation is ongoing,
although we did not find a body.
The amount of blood in the house would indicate
that the victim's wounds were fatal.
Mona Vanderwaal was murdered.
They know that thing's empty, right?
It's a casket and it still weighs a ton.
Mona's mom put keepsakes in it.
Stuffed animals, photo albums,
old retainer.
It's called a cenotaph.
They have them for soldiers whose bodies are never found.
Never say never, Spence.
It's been over three months, Han,
no body, no murder weapon.
And no arrest.
Well, present company excluded.
Let's not forget I'm still an alleged murderer.
Hey, don't lose faith, okay?
That letter Bethany sent Ali could still make a difference.
No, not if Holbrook has anything to say about it.
We should've told Tanner about him and Ali months ago.
Tanner won't believe it
coming from you or anyone else.
She's gonna have to figure it out on her own.
I'm gonna go and get the car.
Okay.
What the hell is she doing here?
Showing up to your victim's funeral?
Classy.
You guys, we have to get her out of here.
Mrs. Vanderwaal?
I came to pay my respects.
And to tell you, one more time,
that I had nothing to do with your--
Then where is my daughter?
Where is her body?
It's okay.
Come with me.
Mrs. Vanderwaal?
I put a load in the dishwasher.
Do you need any help folding the chairs?
No. Thank you, Hanna.
Is there anything that you need?
No, it's all right.
Then I think I'll go.
I'm sorry about what happened at the service.
It was just her...
Alison, alive.
People understand.
It's like Mona was lost at sea.
I accept that she's dead.
My daughter is dead.
But where is she?
An empty casket... what was I thinking?
I think that you were trying to find a way to say goodbye.
We all are.
And that funeral probably helped a lot of people.
I hope it helped someone.
I'll just go fold those chairs before I go.
Hanna.
I want you to take care of this.
How are you doing?
I heard what happened at the church.
It was so ghastly.
Hanna stopped Mona's mom,
but we all wanted to stuff Ali into that empty coffin.
I should have been there.
No, really, we wanted to do it on our own.
Mom's not here.
Well, I know.
She called me, asked me to come by.
Why? What happened?
Bethany Young's parents have petitioned the court
to have your bail revoked.
Okay.
They've been trying to do that for months.
Yes, but this time, it may work.
Why?
They unsealed your indictment today.
We finally know why you were arrested.
It's an open file.
I didn't break any rules looking at it.
What you're looking for isn't there. It's here.
The grounds for Spencer Hastings' arrest warrant.
That was unsealed today.
What convinced the judge
was a statement from a witness.
Someone who saw Spencer Hastings
in the DiLaurentis backyard with a girl,
a blonde dressed in Alison's clothes,
the night that Bethany was buried in that yard.
Who was the witness?
Jessica DiLaurentis.
Mrs. DiLaurentis saw Spencer
in the backyard and told the police?
Where's the statement been for two years?
Where it has been is deliberately hidden
in the files of the officer
who took the statement, Darren Wilden.
We found it just before Thanksgiving.
Wilden had suppressed it.
He may have buried the statement,
but Mrs. D. was still alive.
What stopped her from telling someone else?
Why do you think she didn't?
Wilden was crooked.
He told somebody about the statement,
somebody who'd want it to go away,
and they paid him to keep Mrs. DiLaurentis quiet.
How do you suppose he could do that?
Well, Bethany was a patient at Radley.
Mrs. DiLaurentis was on the board.
She had an affair with Bethany's father.
That's probably where they met.
It always seems to lead back to Radley, doesn't it?
Where's your partner?
Oh, Detective Holbrook?
He's out on temporary assignment.
Once it's all done, this will all be bookshelves.
Oh, looks good...
in a "has to get really messy
before it gets clean" kind of way.
Yeah. Well, I appreciate your optimism.
But I think you need to get your eyes checked.
Have you heard from Oberlin?
No.
No, I haven't yet.
Maybe tomorrow.
Have you heard from Mike since the funeral?
I kind of lost track of him
after the slap heard around the world.
Why?
I'm just wondering how he's doing.
Mona was a lot of complicated things
to a lot of different people,
but she was just one thing to Mike.
He loved her...
and I was the one who tried to screw it up,
twice.
He doesn't want to talk to me about her.
I could try.
I could say that I need help with my bookshelves.
You do need help with your bookshelves.
See, it's a win-win.
Did you finish packing?
Yes.
I thought three months,
I'd get used to the idea of you leaving...
but I haven't.
Neither have I.
You'll miss graduation.
My parents say that's just a technicality.
And prom.
That was a technicality I was looking forward to.
Maybe if we talked to your parents one more time.
They can't hear anything.
I have enough credits to leave early
and that's all that counts.
They want me someplace safe.
California has earthquakes.
I pointed that out.
It didn't work though.
I'll take you to the airport.
My parents will take me. You don't have to do that.
I don't have to, I want to.
What?
I heard a song the other day.
Old song.
The girl says, "Your eyes.
It's a day's work just to look into them."
So you stayed with Mona's mom
after the others left.
Yeah. We cleaned up,
and she told me how she wished
she'd have done more when Mona told her about Alison.
Oh, God, I wanted to crawl under a rug.
We pushed her to help us.
Look, Mona was on Ali's radar long before that.
I still felt awful.
Any luck with that?
I know why Mona wasn't afraid to let me keep it.
It is completely encrypted and secured
unlike anything I've ever seen.
The only thing I know for sure
is that there are chunks of that hard drive
that I'm completely locked out of.
Well, if she went to all that trouble,
there must be something important in there.
I'm not giving up.
My ego's at stake now.
What do you think Ali did with Mona's body?
Ali's the only one with that information.
I don't see her making that public knowledge.
Maybe there's somebody else who knows,
or somebody that could find out.
Who?
Mrs. Grunwald.
Not a good idea.
But she's a psychic. A real psychic.
She's not some card flipper at the carnival.
She has a real gift and we both know it.
You can't mess around with that stuff.
Believe me.
Well, then, who else do we ask?
She saved Ali when Mrs. D. planted her.
She knows all of us,
and she seems to like us in some
disturbing, creepy sort of way.
It is not like Lo-Jack. Okay?
You cannot just call her up and ask where's the body.
And even if she could tell you,
how are you going to explain to Mrs. Vanderwaal
where you got the information, or the police?
Hanna, I know how you feel about Mona's mom,
but calling Grunwald is not going to help anybody.
Bad news?
You don't have to do that.
Do what?
Run from me.
Be afraid.
If you want me to believe you're not
who I think you are, you will leave us all alone.
God, it's like you went to sleep one night
and forgot who I am.
I know exactly who you are, "A."
Stop saying that.
Why should I?
You're "A."
You stole the game from Mona
and then you killed her because she had proof.
And you killed Bethany
because you were jealous of a mental patient.
That's how crazy you are.
Listen to me, Aria.
My parents is talking to the judges right now.
It could be today, it could be tomorrow.
I mean, my mom is at the courthouse,
she's trying to fight it, but...
Spencer, that's crazy, okay.
They can't just revoke your bail.
Well, we have to do something.
What? We found a letter from Bethany
explaining the matching clothes, explaining everything,
and Holbrook is doing whatever he can to get it thrown out,
to make sure that it looks like I forged the whole thing.
But Mona found out that Ali hit Bethany
with that shovel and was murdered for it.
So if we can prove that Ali killed Mona,
the cops will realize that these two crimes are connected,
that one motivated the other, that you are innocent.
If it were easy to prove that Ali's a murderer,
wouldn't we have done that already?
If Mona can find proof, so can we.
I mean, it's got to be somewhere, right?
How's Caleb doing with her laptop?
He's not giving up, but he's not getting anywhere either.
Guys, as long as Ali has an alibi, she's untouchable.
So then we tear down her alibi.
Her dad won't budge.
I'm not talking about her dad.
Hey, I didn't see you at the cemetery yesterday.
Did you leave early?
I guess.
You did.
Okay.
Any reason?
It wasn't a real funeral.
No?
No body, no funeral.
Does that make you upset?
I'm just...
I'm trying to get a sense of how this all makes you feel.
You look up how to talk to me online or something?
I feel like I don't want to talk to you
about my dead girlfriend.
I just wasn't sure you thought she was actually gone.
No one loses that much blood and lives to tell the story.
You aren't acting like you've lost someone.
How would you like me to act?
You want me to cry my eyes out?
Bang my fists on the wall? She's gone.
That's it. People leave. People die.
It's the only sure thing there is in this world.
你最后的亲吻永远是最甜美的
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for remembering me.
You're hard to forget.
I take that as a compliment.
There's no one in there. It's empty.
I know.
Well, how is it you think I can help you?
I want you to help me find the body of the girl
that's supposed to be in that box.
We think that Alison killed her.
How do you expect me to find her?
Little Bungee.
Bungee?
That's his name.
How did you know that?
Kitchen's that way if you want to look for your mom's
whatever-it-was.
Muffin tray.
She swears she left it here.
Ali's not home.
Yeah, I know.
You two are never in the same place
at the same time these days.
That a trick question?
No.
No, it's just a regular statement.
What do you want, Spencer?
I want to know why you're protecting her.
The cops found traces of Mona's DNA in Ali's trunk.
But it's not enough to arrest her,
not when you're providing her with an alibi.
Your dad, I understand.
But you--
It was Thanksgiving, Spencer.
You're the only one who finds it hard to believe
we were all together that day.
Jason, I know that you--
Em, you find those muffins yet?
Uh, no, not yet.
At some point that day,
she got in her car and she left the house,
and she didn't come back for a long time.
I know she's your sister, but so am I.
She set me up, Jason.
I'm gonna go to jail because of her.
Somebody's dead because of her.
They're the ones that are asking you to lie
and all I want is the truth.
Please.
Gates and walls,
dams and barriers.
How can you live in such a psychically
constipated environment?
I eat a lot of fiber.
Secrets are one thing,
but secrets that carry over into death,
are very toxic.
It makes it hard to see clearly.
I see,
but as through a glass darkly.
Did Alison kill Mona?
你最后的亲吻永远是最甜美的
Each one hated the other...
because each one feared the other,
because...
each one knew something about the other.
Where's Mona?
She isn't in Rosewood. She's in the dark.
She is not having an easy passing.
Betrayal.
Betrayal and loss.
Her soul is caught, bound.
She is surrounded by earth
and insects and cold.
There is no peace, only fear.
Well, that was a bust.
Spencer.
No, Em, just, you should go, okay?
Go, be with Paige,
because at least one of us
deserves a good last day in Rosewood.
What is that?
I stole Ali's hairbrush.
Why would you do that?
Let's just say the cops were to do another sweep of Mona's house.
Sure, Ali has an alibi
but how strong can it be
when Ali's DNA is found at the crime scene?
Emily, no. First of all, you can't just tell the cops
to go back and look again.
And second of all,
creating false evidence is an actual crime.
Spencer, you're being charged with actual murder.
Jason, what are you doing here?
I came by to pick up some files for the office.
They were up in that closet with all Dad's family photos.
You know you have three full baby albums?
Guess, how many I've got.
Remember this?
It was a good day.
No, it wasn't.
Dad forgot his wallet.
We were fighting the whole time.
It took eight shots
before we finally got one of us all smiling.
I guess I remember it differently.
You always had a knack for that.
Remembering things differently, you and Dad.
I wish I had that.
I really do.
You had him wrapped around your finger from day one.
Spencer talked to you, didn't she?
Yeah, she did, and Emily.
And they're right, Ali.
You went somewhere on Thanksgiving day.
Then you came back and barely said a word.
Where did you go, Ali?
Really.
I'm being framed, Jason.
Spencer, Emily, Aria, Hanna...
they're all working together.
They wish I'd never come back and now they want me gone.
You have to believe me.
I did not kill Mona.
Well, must be nice to have your own place.
It's my mom's name on the lease.
She's helping me out for a while, so.
Here.
I didn't know how you took it,
but there's cream and sugar in the bag.
Thanks.
What's all this?
Decryption software.
It's searching for any existing patterns
that may have been used to encrypt Mona's data.
We find the pattern, we unlock the files.
Sounds fancy.
Yeah, well, the problem is that
Mona isn't using any known patterns.
She made them all up.
I've been running decryption software for months with no luck.
So all this hacking stuff,
does it like work on websites too?
You trying out for anonymous or something?
No, of course not.
Aria, your Sudoku prowess doesn't exactly qualify you
to help out with this kind of stuff.
You know that.
So why are you here?
Okay. Three months ago, I applied to six colleges,
and I didn't get into Brown.
That's fine.
It was kind of a stretch, but Oberlin?
I mean, I nailed that interview.
So you want me to break into Oberlin's database
and find out why you got rejected?
Yeah, I need to know if it's me or if it's "A."
All right. Take a seat.
What am I supposed to do with all this?
Give a man a fish, he only eats for a day.
All right, Caleb, look, if you don't want to help...
Okay, teach me.
Do you know how long Mona's mom is gonna be gone?
I don't know. We have to act fast.
God, the last time I was here...
We were stepping over Mona's blood.
Okay. So the police have already searched,
so we have to think of places that they might have missed,
or places that the hair could have moved since then.
Okay.
Bingo.
You guys tell Mona's mom
that she's got cameras in her molding.
Why does it have to be me?
Because she likes you.
If you suggest the police
should take another look, she'll listen.
Just tell her that Mona said something about cameras,
and how she was scared.
What makes you sure it was Mona's camera?
Because if her mother knew it was there,
she would have told the police.
Why can't you ask Toby?
I mean, he's just joined the police force.
Do you want me to tell him that I found it
while I was trying to plant evidence?
You guys, I have to take a step back
from the Mona of it all, I really do.
Hanna, that blood we saw inside Mona's front door,
that camera was pointed right at it.
Okay, it must have seen what happened.
I've decided what to do.
I'm going to set up a fund,
to buy books for the children's library.
And inside each book there will be a card
with a picture of Mona,
explaining that the book is a gift from her.
I think that's a really nice idea.
Mona loved to read.
For a long time, I think it was all she had.
Hanna, do you want to borrow that?
I can't read this.
You should.
Henry James understood girls.
This is more of a Spencer Hastings type book.
You're smarter than Spencer Hastings.
I am not.
You are.
You just pretend like you aren't.
It's another way to hide.
Haven't I taught you anything?
You don't have to hide from anyone anymore.
Let other people hide from you for a change.
Hanna?
Would you like to keep that book?
Thank you.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said,
about Mona being afraid,
and I remember her telling me
that she wanted to set up cameras
to keep an eye on things.
Cameras?
Do you think that she would have done something like that?
Hello?
Mike?
Ezra?
我 没问题 10点到
No.
No! No!
Don't do this to me.
Please.
Alison! Ali.
Ali. Ali.
Stop!
Hello, Alison.
Hello, Mrs. Grunwald.
I was visiting someone in town.
How fortunate to run into you like this.
It's pretty amazing.
I'm not going to ask you how you are.
When people say that,
they really don't want an honest answer, do they?
They just ask so you'll say "Fine,"
and they don't have to deal with you anymore.
Precisely.
If people meeting casually
told each other how they really felt,
the streets would be awash with tears.
However, I am sorry for your loss.
I have to be somewhere, Mrs. Grunwald.
As do we all.
Nice to see you.
Same here.
You are in my thoughts and prayers, Alison.
Thank you.
Mrs. Vanderwaal asked us to search the house again,
and we found this.
There were three cameras.
This is the only relevant one.
Mona put them in herself.
The batteries ran down months ago,
but they were working on Thanksgiving.
Is there anything about the attacker
that in any way is familiar to you?
Do you recognize anything about that person?
It could be my sister.
It could be Alison.
How could it be your sister if Alison was with you
and your father when the incident occurred?
Because she wasn't with us.
That was a lie.
You're saying that Alison wasn't with you
when Mona Vanderwaal was killed?
That's right.
Thank you, Mr. DiLaurentis.
Does Ezra know what happened?
No, and I'm going to keep it that way.
Are you sure it was Ali who attacked you and took the computer?
Who else could it be?
That's not what I asked.
Yes, I'm sure.
What is it?
It's Paige.
I wanted to take her to the airport, but she has to leave now.
Oh, maybe that's what you should do.
No, we have to do this together.
Can you at least try to stall them?
Get out of my way.
Now!
You killed Mona, Ali.
We're not letting you get away.
"A" set me up.
You're letting "A" win.
Shut up, Ali.
Who's going to protect you when I'm gone?
If you do this,
you'll all be next.
Move!
Now!
Hands above your head.
Ladies, move.
Turn around slowly.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Alison DiLaurentis, you are under arrest
for the murder of Mona Vanderwaal.
Turn around.
You found my phone.
Yeah.
Can I talk to you for a second?
I'm starving. Can we do this later?
Alison's been arrested...
for Mona's murder.
Okay.
Okay? That's your response?
Just sit down, please.
Here's the thing.
I'm afraid to know what you know.
Mona knew a lot of things,
about me, a lot of things about my friends.
You know, this time I thought that it was you
that was afraid to talk to me, but really I...
I think that it was me who was afraid to talk to you.
But if Ali's behind bars...
maybe that means that we don't have to be afraid anymore.
I know you hated Mona.
Maybe for good reason, maybe not.
But now you're just like the rest of them...
pretending she was a saint when you didn't even know her.
You know what that's like,
listening to a bunch of people memorialize someone they don't even know?
You think if people said how great she was to her face,
none of this would've ever happened?
I'm sick of being told
how sweet and smart and nice she was.
She wasn't nice.
Anyone can be nice.
There will never be anyone like her.
Ever.
But do you think that maybe sometime you could tell me about her?
The Mona you knew?
The real Mona.
Okay.
I'm gonna see if Dad needs help with dinner.
This is a free boarding announcement for Flight 89B, Rome.
We are now inviting passengers with small children
and any passengers requiring special assistance
to begin boarding at this time.
Please have your boarding pass and identification ready.
Regular boarding will begin in approximately...
Oh, God, you're here.
You changed your mind.
The airline changed my gate. My flight's boarding now.
How did you get past security?
I bought a $69 ticket to Atlantic City.
Paige, you don't have to go.
They arrested Alison for killing Mona.
She's in jail.
She won't stay there.
Yes, she will.
Tell your parents, they have to let you stay.
It's safe now.
Emily, I have to go.
Listen to me, you don't.
Yes, I do.
I've thought about this for months, and I do.
Why?
First, because my parents want me to.
Okay. Well, we can fight that.
I don't want to fight anymore.
I'm tired of fighting.
I've used so much energy fighting and being afraid,
I'm worried I'm not gonna have anything left to just live.
You know what I mean.
Yeah. I guess I do.
So maybe this isn't such a bad idea.
You know, it's a terrible idea.
What if we decide to pretend it's a good idea?
This is the final boarding announcement
for Flight 214 to San Francisco.
All ticketed passengers,
please make your way to the gate.
Please don't go.
I have to.
Okay, well, take another flight.
It's not going to be any easier tomorrow.
This isn't fair.
Maybe not, but right now,
this is what's supposed to happen to us.
Spencer.
I wanted to tell you this in person.
We have been reviewing all of the evidence,
and we now believe that Mona Vanderwaal
was not Alison's first victim.
Bethany Young?
The DA is dropping the charges against you.
The police think Alison set you up.
Oh, my God.
It's over, Spencer.
It's all over.
For a minute, I thought
I'd just get on the plane to Atlantic City
and fly away, but I didn't.
I've been to Atlantic City, you made the right choice.
You know, Paige was wrong.
She should have stayed.
I don't think she was wrong. She got out.
We should all think about getting out of here.
To Atlantic City?
I just said that...
No, no, not to Atlantic City, to anywhere.
I mean, Ali's in jail,
nobody thinks I killed anybody.
Nothing's keeping us here anymore.
After we graduate, we can go wherever we want to.
Ali kept us in this town like we were magnetized.
That's over.
The spell is broken.
We've all got college applications out.
So it's not too late.
If we can achieve escape velocity,
we can have a chance at our own actual lives.
No gates, no dams, no barriers.
An actual life.
Is that the carnival at St. Bridgette's?
It's so beautiful.
No, no, I don't accept this.
Alison is "A," and Alison is in jail.
Oh, my God.
They don't allow fireworks in prison.
No, no, this has to be something
that she set up before they got her, right?
That's what it has to be.
