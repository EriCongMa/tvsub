uh , excuse me , miss .
you lost ?
uh , no .
i was actually wondering how much .
how old are you ?
i &apos;m 18 .
w @-@ wait . i have money .
do you have a car ?
i took a bus .
all right .
hope you like doing it standing up .
i--i wouldn &apos;t know . you &apos;re my--you &apos;re my first .
i &apos;ll be gentle .
money .
ok .
you see my hips ?
see my hips ? you swing right through , nice and easy .
all right , come on . you give it a try .
it was just a ride to the airport .
this wasn &apos;t exactly what i had in mind
when i said i owed you one .
hey , you act like this is torture .
you know , there are people who think this is fun .
believe it or not , most of my childhood sports memories
aren &apos;t altogether pleasant .
reid , it &apos;s just one game .
we need a body . you might not even have to play .
perfect . can we go now ?
reid .
just humor me ?
take the bat and get up there and give it a try .
get up there .
you &apos;re gonna like this , kid . i promise .
see it in here . just relax .
here we go .
ok , ok . first try .
keep your eye on the ball .
gravity plus drag coefficient plus magnus--
i see what you &apos;re saying .
if i can adjust the velocity of my swing--
no , what i &apos;m saying is get out of your head .
just feel it .
feel it . feel it .
don &apos;t think . just feel it .
just feel . don &apos;t think , just feel .
here it comes .
reid , that &apos;s not feeling it .
i &apos;m feeling like an idiot .
well , today &apos;s your lucky day .
we just got a case .
yes .
thank god .
last night in miami , the body of amanda lopez
was found in an alley .
she had been brutally beaten and suffocated .
23 years old , originally from tampa ,
ran away from her foster home when she was 16 years old .
runaway , prostitute . she couldn &apos;t be more high risk .
and there was evidence of sexual assault , a lot of it .
occupational hazard .
no way to tell if our unsub is responsible for that .
beating and suffocation .
so , he &apos;s a sadist .
a lot of violence . were there any other victims ?
uh , actually , yes , but not the human variety .
in the last month , 6 puppies have been
suffocated and beaten , and thank god there are no photos ,
because i draw the line at dead dogs .
we sure it &apos;s the same guy ?
identical dna samples were found at all the crime scenes ,
but no match in the codis database .
该系统包括犯罪现场收集到的不明来历dna
even if there was a match , it might not give us an i.d ..
that sure is a lot of rage . i wonder why he &apos;s so angry .
it &apos;s about the power . suffocation takes work .
he likes it up close and personal .
this unsub &apos;s just graduated from animals to human victims .
we need to stop him before he goes serial .
wheels up in 30 .
我看到了
what are you watching ?
jeez , mom , you ever hear of knocking ?
who was that screaming ?
it just some stupid youtube video . what do you want ?
i just came to see if you wanted some breakfast .
i &apos;m fine .
uh , please leave me alone ?
ok .
&quot; better than a thousand days of diligent study
is one day with a great teacher . &quot;
japanese proverb .
amanda lopez has no next of kin
and no one reported her missing .
she was an easy target .
the unsub probably hoped for that .
the animals were all killed
in a relatively small geographical radius ,
in a mostly middle @-@ class suburban area .
but amanda &apos;s body was found the other side of town
in miami &apos;s skid row .
so he left his comfort zone to kill his first human .
a choice he probably made out of necessity .
it &apos;s hard to find easy targets
in middle @-@ class residential areas .
he may be young . typically you see violence to animals
in children and teens .
but the jump to humans is usually made in their mid @-@ 20s .
mm @-@ mmm . thomas dillon started killing at 39 .
joseph duncan was 43 ?
usually .
well , either way , this guy &apos;s moving fast .
his animal kills were only days apart .
he enjoys it . and now that he &apos;s gotten a taste for humans ,
he &apos;s gonna need another fix soon .
dave , you and blake go to the m.e ..
morgan and reid to the crime scenes .
jj , you &apos;re with me .
agent hotchner .
detective ogilvie , nice to meet you .
this is agent jareau .
detective .
right this way .
thank you .
when i first saw what this guy was doing ,
i wanted to call you weeks ago ,
but brass didn &apos;t think that dogs was worth the trouble .
got you set up in here .
here &apos;s the list of pet owners you asked for .
thank you .
is there anything else i can get you ?
no , i think we &apos;re good for now , thanks .
whatever you need . we &apos;re here to help .
you know , looking at the offense cluster ,
there &apos;s a pretty good chance he could live ,
right in this area .
or it could just be his hunting grounds .
i don &apos;t know . i mean , look at where he killed all the animals .
you could walk between each spot ,
but then he goes way up here
to get amanda lopez .
there &apos;s a ... busline that runs straight through
both neighrhrhoods .
and she was killed only a couple of blocks
from one of the stops .
all right , so maybe he doesn &apos;t have access to a vehicle .
that would give us an abbreviated distance to crime value .
so he starts with dogs in his own neighborhood ,
then when he works up the courage ,
he hops on the bus
and finds his first human victim .
garcia &apos;s compiling a list of known violent offenders in the area .
her jaw , orbital bones
were fractured in several places .
and he did it with his bare hands .
i wouldn &apos;t be surprised if he broke one of them .
see here .
he started the beating with his right
and he finished with his left .
no defensive wounds .
he caught her by surprise in a blitz attack .
this took anger and stamina .
he &apos;s in shape or on drugs .
or in shape and on drugs .
the actual cause of death-- suffocation .
so he beats her into submission
and then suffocates her with the bag .
we also found alcohol in her system .
she was fairly lit when he killed her .
well , it helps that she &apos;s , what , barely 100 pounds ?
easier to subdue .
i don &apos;t think he was a very big guy himself .
you can tell by the bruising .
he &apos;s got small hands .
all that rage . and even with his animal victims .
he must be getting off on the violence .
so , he &apos;s a sexual sadist .
a young , inexperienced one .
he &apos;s disorganized , sloppy .
and he killed and dumped her in a high @-@ traffic area .
he &apos;s too impulsive to be an older guy .
he &apos;s lucky , too .
that alley &apos;s near a major thoroughfare .
it &apos;s a miracle nobody saw anything .
uh , excuse me , hollie .
i think--i think i may need to go home .
i &apos;m not feeling so good .
there &apos;s no one to cover your shift , toby .
can &apos;t you do it ?
and work another double ?
sure . it &apos;s what i live for .
so what &apos;s wrong with you ?
i ... puked this morning .
i think i have the chills now .
it feels like the flu . i just--
i mean , i hope i &apos;m not contagious .
fine . go .
the last dog was found in these bushes over here .
the other dogs were found in a similar park not far away .
except for the one found
in an alley about a mile from here .
hey , reid .
you remember those days ?
mm , not really .
well , where did you hang out as a teenager ?
library , chemistry lab , library--
no , no , no , no , no . i &apos;m talking about normal ,
non @-@ genius teenage type of stuff .
malls , coffee shops ,
parks .
we passed a mall and two coffee shops on the way here .
and a high school , too .
that would explain why the unsub &apos;s so impulsive .
he might still be an adolescent .
mm ! i thought you &apos;d never call .
my ears are hungry .
your voice is like food .
well , i need your help , sweetness .
yes , yes . your wish is my command .
i need you to widen your search
for violent offenders in the area to juveniles .
mm , searching for bad boys . it &apos;s my specialty .
i &apos;ll hit you with a list asap .
thank you , angel .
that &apos;s all you &apos;ve got is &quot; hey &quot; ?
you mad at me ?
mad at you ? why would i be mad at you , toby ?
you do something wrong ?
get in the car .
get in the damn car .
what do you got to say for yourself ?
i got your texts . i &apos;m sorry . all right ?
we &apos;ve been over this .
you know how bad that could have been ?
yeah , i--look , i was nervous ,
i freaked out . i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t really know what happened .
it wasn &apos;t like i thought it was gonna be .
i &apos;m sorry .
they say it &apos;s never as good as your first time .
the truth is ...
first time sucks .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing .
you &apos;re fumbling around .
it &apos;s awkward .
it does get better .
i promise .
all right .
you know what ?
i might have just the thing to make you feel better .
i didn &apos;t even know the bureau had a softball team .
since when do you play ?
since morgan drafted me .
really ? why ?
don &apos;t let the skinny geek thing fool you .
i know the good doctor &apos;s deceptively athletic .
oh , it &apos;s deceptive , all right .
blake , what did you find out ?
none of the pet owners had much .
each of their dogs just disappeared from their yard .
but he did get into their yards unnoticed ,
so that means he stalked them and knew their patterns .
what about the list of juvenile offenders garcia sent us ?
local p.d. &apos; s checking out a few names that caught my eye .
excuse me . agent hotchner ,
another woman &apos;s body was just found .
that was quick .
ok . i got it .
her name is vicky thomas .
22 @-@ year @-@ old prostitute .
originally out of daytona beach .
and she &apos;s got a 2 @-@ year @-@ old son .
victimology matches .
so does the plastic bag .
guys , this is a residential area , not frequented by prostitutes .
he didn &apos;t kill her here , he just dumped her .
he didn &apos;t beat her either . she took a blow to the head .
bite marks . pretty rare m.o ..
he didn &apos;t do that to the other victim .
and look at her . she &apos;s filthy .
he must have rolled her around in all this trash .
probably a forensic countermeasure
used to degrade the crime scene .
and the victim .
ok , so he beats and suffocates his first victim
and just dumps her .
but this one he clocks over the head ,
bites her , but he covers his tracks .
that &apos;s a huge shift in m.o. you think he &apos;s evolving ?
well , that &apos;s a pretty rapid evolution .
it might not even be the same guy .
well , it can &apos;t be a copycat .
the story literally just made the news .
yeah , and what about the plastic bag ?
he used that on both victims .
yeah , but nothing about the second kill
says young or impulsive .
he thought this one through .
guys , what if we &apos;re dealing with a team ?
if there are two of them , they &apos;re feeding off each other .
this could turn into a spree real soon .
hey there .
how you doin &apos; ?
i &apos;m good , baby . how are you ?
oh , i had a hard day at work .
i &apos;m just looking for a little fun .
how much ?
depends on what you want .
i want it all .
200 .
sold .
get in .
so what &apos;s your name ?
shawna .
shawna . that &apos;s a pretty name .
sit back and relax and enjoy the ride .
you don &apos;t want to make me use this .
not so tight . not so tight .
you want to make this part last .
the trick is you want to give her a good scare .
that way she does whatever you say .
isn &apos;t that right , shawna ?
you &apos;re gonna do whatever we tell you , aren &apos;t you ?
yeah .
jogger ran by this morning .
said his dog went crazy .
they &apos;re not bothering about hiding the bodies .
not worried about being connected to their victims .
arrogant .
what do we know about her ?
name is shawna radford .
21 @-@ year @-@ old prostitute .
some of my guys have seen her around .
she doesn &apos;t trick anywhere near here .
there &apos;s no apparent bite marks .
she &apos;s got a lot of swelling and bruising .
she obviously took a blow to the forehead .
looks like it could have been a hammer .
so why do they even need the bag ?
suffocation &apos;s a form of torture .
and they enjoy watching her suffer .
it &apos;s also become something of a signature .
in this case , it &apos;s part m.o. , part ritual .
and this combines elements of the first and second murders .
the first time was violent and sloppy .
no planning , no forensic countermeasures .
just a lot of rage .
the second murder was more sophisticated .
if this is a team , one of them
might be much younger than the other .
which means the older
unsub is probably the more dominant partner .
he &apos;s teaching him .
the first kill was committed by the younger unsub .
it was exactly that , his very first .
so he probably did it alone .
so what does that make the second kill ?
a demonstration .
and this one &apos;s about perfecting their m.o. together .
when can i take this thing off ?
this is a surprise . why do you want to ruin it ?
i-- &apos; cause i don &apos;t like surprises .
we are ... here .
you know , when we started this whole thing ,
i wasn &apos;t sure , i just--
you know , i didn &apos;t know if you had it in you .
thanks a lot ?
last couple nights ,
i mean , you &apos;ve come a long way .
i &apos;m proud of you , toby .
i really am .
go ahead . take that thing off .
ok .
ta @-@ daa !
this is your surprise ?
it &apos;s graduation day , my man .
come on .
based on victim type and kill zone dynamics ,
we believe that we &apos;re looking for two white males ,
one significantly older than the other .
the younger unsub we believe is an adolescent .
he probably lives in the area ,
so odds are he &apos;s a student at a local high school .
we think the older unsub is in his late 30s to early 40s .
now , he &apos;s sophisticated ,
so he probably has violent criminal experience .
so you should be looking at ex @-@ cons ,
and we can &apos;t rule out people who &apos;ve had law enforcement training .
the older one had access to teenagers ,
but somehow he didn &apos;t stick out .
which means he most likely lives or works near an area
where young people congregate .
like a school , church , or a community center .
now , he &apos;s also charismatic ,
the type of guy that a teen would easily trust .
maybe a teacher or a coach .
no . no , no , no .
it &apos;s lightweight , cheap . it won &apos;t last .
now , this one--
look , it &apos;s a little more expensive , but it &apos;s worth it .
much like the d.c. snipers ,
john allen muhammad and lee boyd malvo ,
造成当地巨大恐慌
this is a mentor / mentee relationship ,
where the old one is attempting to teach the younger one
to become a better killer .
this dynamic is rare , but the symbiotic nature
of their mutual desires actually
strengthens their affinity for one another .
there &apos;s a chance they &apos;re related .
we should consider a father and son team ,
brothers , or possibly an uncle and nephew .
but even if there is no biological connection ,
this relationship has all the hallmarks of their kind of bond .
the younger one &apos;s probably looking for a father figure ,
trying to fill some emotional void .
no fuss , no muss .
you have your fun and johnny law &apos;s none the wiser .
they prey on prostitutes ,
so put the word on the street
to any of the working girls you may know .
yeah , i like this one .
that &apos;s a $ 100 titanium framing hammer .
beautiful ...
easily traced .
now , this one ,
this is your garden variety $ 5.00.16 @-@ ouncer with a steel head .
sold at a hundred stores everywhere .
this is the one you want .
and their pace is relentless .
given their combined appetites and the player @-@ coach dynamic ,
these two are especially dangerous .
thank you very much .
all right , let &apos;s hit it , people .
what have you got , garcia ?
sir , i am afraid i have come up dry .
a lot of weird stuff happens in south florida .
i found a few hammer attacks ,
a shocking number of biting attacks ,
but only one or the other , no combo platters .
all right , go back another 10 years .
and look nationwide .
our older unsub must have a criminal past .
that m.o. is too specific to
just be popping up this late in his life .
you got it . back in a flash .
all right , thanks , garcia .
hey . i ruled out most of the kids on that offender list ,
but there is one that i &apos;m having brought in .
his name is jose aguilar .
he moved to miami right around the time
the animal murders started .
kicked out of two schools in orlando for bullying .
broke one kid &apos;s nose .
gave the other a concussion .
but that &apos;s not why i want to talk to him .
he made a visit to the e.r. ,
right after being attacked by a guy with a hammer .
the kid refused to make an official police report .
apparently he hates cops .
keep me posted .
jose , appreciate you coming in , man .
like i had a choice .
why am i here ?
look , it &apos;s all good , all right ?
we just want to ask you a few questions .
i didn &apos;t do anything . i don &apos;t know anything . we done ?
kid , i get it . the neighborhood i grew up in ,
we hated five @-@ 0 , too .
oh , so you can relate .
we &apos;re not those kind of cops , man .
oh , whatever .
i think i can relate .
i doubt that .
because when you look at me ,
you jump to a particular set of conclusions .
it &apos;s human nature to make assumptions based on appearances .
it &apos;s an outdated primal instinct
born of our need to quickly assess our surroundings .
of course , in this modern era ,
those assumptions tend to be very wrong
and ... often quite hurtful .
it happens to me a lot ,
and i bet that happens to you all the time .
i swear i didn &apos;t do anything .
we believe you . we just
want to know what you wouldn &apos;t tell the cops
about the man that attacked you with the hammer .
i don &apos;t remember much .
you want to try something interesting ?
this may sound crazy ,
but close your eyes and concentrate .
i think you &apos;d be surprised
to see how much you can remember if you try .
all right .
do you remember what you were doing that day before the attack ?
just went to school .
what was the weather like ?
hot .
hey . sorry i &apos;m a little late .
an hour &apos;s more than a little .
i said i was sorry .
you &apos;ve been late almost every day for the past two weeks .
i &apos;ve been really busy with school and stuff .
i &apos;ll do better .
toby , i have to let you go .
what ?
i warned you a bunch of times about being late .
i--
i &apos;m sorry .
then there was that thing with the puppies .
that wasn &apos;t my fault .
look , it &apos;s my job to manage this place ,
and i can &apos;t do my job if you can &apos;t do yours .
hollie , hollie , please .
you should go clean out your locker .
sorry .
and what were you doing just before the attack ?
walking home from school .
i cut through the park &apos; cause i had to take a leak .
then i heard this barking .
then i saw this kid
and he was beating on this dog .
it pissed me off . i like dogs .
so i jumped the kid , started beating his ass ,
and the dog ran away .
the next thing i know , i get hit in the back with something hard .
it hurt like a bitch .
i look up and see some dude with a hammer .
he popped me one more time in the arm before i took off .
did you know the kid who was beating the dog ?
some white kid . never seen him .
he doesn &apos;t go to my school .
what about the guy with the hammer ?
he was white , too , but older .
could you describe him to a sketch artist ?
the older dude--
no , it happened too fast .
but the kid ...
i think so .
good night .
see you tomorrow .
so jose rolls up on the younger unsub while he &apos;s doing his thing .
but the older unsub just happens to be there to come to his rescue ?
or the older one was already there watching .
that attack happened months ago ,
so they &apos;ve known each other at least that long .
why would a grown man in his 40s
connect with a teenager ?
easily explained if they &apos;re related .
or if their relationship is sexual .
well , if they were related or having sex ,
there would probably be more of a connection
and there might not be such a big disparity in their m.o.s.
the dominant partner might not even allow the submissive
to participate in the kill .
if he &apos;s mentoring him , maybe it &apos;s because he wants to give back
or leave some kind of legacy .
well , like in most cases ,
the dominant one probably initiated the contact .
you think he sought the younger one out .
that &apos;s usually how it goes .
it takes talent to see talent .
when and where they met is gonna be the key .
it &apos;s only a matter of time before their partnership dissolves .
in an student / teacher dynamic there comes a day
when the student no longer needs the teacher .
calm down , ok ?
calm down !
all right , hang on a second , i &apos;m gonna put you on speaker .
go ahead , baby girl . what you got ?
ask and you shall receive .
i widened my search , got a hit .
one rudi stein .
had an affinity for hammering and chewing on hookers in new york .
convicted in &apos; 89 .
had a massive stroke right there in the sing sing prison yard ,
died last july .
that m.o. is too similar to
what we &apos;ve seen not to be related .
but the timeline doesn &apos;t fit .
stein got locked up over 20 years ago .
what if the mentor got mentored himself ?
so you think stein mentored our older unsub ?
then the unsub learned his skills in prison .
there &apos;s a reason they call it crime u .
if the guy who took the time to mentor him suddenly died ,
it could have triggered his need to pay it forward .
garcia , i need everything you &apos;ve got on rudi stein--
cellmates , relatives , known associates ,
and anything you can find .
will do . stay tuned . i &apos;m out .
toby . what are you doing here , man ?
like my new ride ?
what are you talking about ? you don &apos;t even have a driver &apos;s license .
come check out the back .
shut up ! remember what i told you .
nice , huh ? just like you showed me .
she &apos;ll do whatever i say .
what the hell are you doing , man ?
dude , it &apos;s hollie .
your boss ?
yeah .
and you brought her here ?
yeah . we can take her out on the boat like the others .
are you out of your mind ?
you watch the news ? the fbi &apos;s in town .
bitch fired me today .
how many times have we been over this ?
never somebody you know
and never where you live .
is this her car ?
yeah .
oh , my god !
go ahead , garcia .
sir , i &apos;ve got something . from 2002 to 2006,
rudi stein shared a work detail
with a david roy turner .
he &apos;s a miami resident .
now , it must have been a match made in heaven ,
because they remained pen pals after turner was released .
what was turner in for ?
he assaulted an underage male prostitute .
so , he has a preference for younger boys .
it explains why he chose a teenage apprentice .
you got an address ?
uh , yeah , i already sent them .
i got a home and two work addresses .
turner works as a groundskeeper for the miami @-@ dade parks and rec ,
and he &apos;s also a part @-@ time bartender .
morgan , blake , and reid , take the residence .
the rest of us will take the work address .
it &apos;s clear !
clear .
clear .
there &apos;s nobody here .
hi , papi chulo . what &apos;s up ?
hey , good @-@ lookin &apos; , i got
david roy turner &apos;s laptop in front of me .
can you pull everything off of it ?
in my sleep . power it up . let &apos;s go .
get her inside .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m gonna get the boat ready .
it &apos;ll be sweet .
sweet ? no . no , no .
sweet is what you get when you do things right .
work is what you get when you do things wrong .
and this is all wrong .
why are you being such a bitch about this ?
&apos;cause you broke every rule in the book , toby ,
and we went over the book .
now get her inside before you really piss me off .
you at least gonna help me carry her ?
you made your bed , lie in it .
hey , morgan , look at this stuff .
two different closets filled with this stuff ,
all unopened and unused .
no dog lives here .
i don &apos;t see a bowl or a crate or a leash , nothing .
everything was purchased from hal &apos;s pet shop .
i found these under his bed .
haven &apos;t gone through every one ,
but they go back to 2006 .
well , that &apos;s the year turner was released from prison .
could be a habit he picked up inside .
loves sports . he &apos;s into leisure and travel .
and he is a big fan of murder .
it &apos;s not random .
there &apos;s individual sections for each case .
it gets better .
this guy was tracking the animal murders .
yep . every one of them .
hey , guys .
that looks like the boy from the composite sketch .
whoever the kid is , turner &apos;s obsessed with him .
hey , mama . tell me something good .
well , i cleaned out this nutbag &apos;s laptop .
the guy was a torture porn connoisseur .
the dude makes rick james seem amish .
i also looked at his emails and social networks .
he &apos;s been in touch a lot with a toby whitewood ,
and by a lot , i mean a couple , 3 times a day for the last year .
well , what do you got on whitewood ?
he &apos;s a 15 @-@ year @-@ old sophomore at mckinley high school .
his parents divorced two years ago .
he lives with his mom claire .
that &apos;s about it . he &apos;s squeaky clean .
garcia , what about employment or volunteer activities ?
pause . he works part @-@ time at hal &apos;s pet shop .
you got a picture of the kid ?
sent .
garcia , that &apos;s him . you got an address ?
yep . work address has been sent to you .
home address is actually closer to hotch .
thanks .
that explains how he got close to toby .
somehow he figured out who was committing the animal murders ,
he stalked him at his job
and eventually earned his trust .
at least help me get her on the boat ?
no , i &apos;ll do it . you , uh , you clean the car .
use the supplies in that locker .
and when i say clean , i mean spic and span .
but then we can take her out on the boat .
we are not gonna do anything .
i &apos;m gonna take her out on the boat . i &apos;m gonna get rid of her .
and you are gonna get rid of that car .
what ? ! that &apos;s not fair . she &apos;s mine .
no . no , no , no .
the second you brought her over to my house ,
she became mine .
now go .
did you not hear me ?
you know , you don &apos;t tell me what to do . you &apos;re not my father .
no . your father bailed on you and your mom
&apos;cause he couldn &apos;t deal .
me , i &apos;m the guy that got you through it .
don &apos;t act like you did me some big favor .
i know exactly what you wanted , perv .
what &apos;s that , tobe ?
you think that i don &apos;t see the way you look at me ?
i &apos;m not stupid , you know .
i should have trusted my gut . you don &apos;t have it in you .
you &apos;re nothing but a sad little loser .
you &apos;re an old ex @-@ con that likes hanging out with kids ,
and ... i &apos;m the loser ?
you &apos;re wasting my time .
get out of here .
come on , pretty girl .
claire whitewood ?
yes .
we &apos;re with the fbi . we &apos;re looking for toby .
he &apos;s not here .
you know where he is ?
i haven &apos;t seen him since this morning .
what did he do ?
yeah , go ahead , garcia . what do you got ?
two things .
one-- david roy turner &apos;s father nate ,
he was a boat mechanic . he owned a repair shop .
he died 12 years ago , but according to public records ,
it &apos;s still in his name .
yes , i just sent you the address .
yeah , i got it . hang on , guys .
what was the second thing , garcia ?
the second thing is ,
is that the manager at the pet store
where toby works at was just reported missing by her fiance ,
and her name is hollie riggio .
if toby had anything to do with the girl &apos;s disappearance ,
then his victim preference is changing .
or the prostitutes were just practice
for the girl he really wanted .
you know , the old guy was right .
taking my time to see that look in your eyes is worth it .
you see , in here ,
i &apos;m the boss .
you know about being the boss , don &apos;t you ?
get away from me !
no . no , no .
come on .
no ! no ! no--
stop it .
i taught you everything .
oh , i can &apos;t-- my god , i can &apos;t believe this is happening .
it &apos;s like we &apos;re cursed or something .
i know this is a lot ,
and we &apos;re here to help you however we can .
is there anything i can get you ?
3 years ago ,
toby and his 17 @-@ year @-@ old sister were carjacked .
the assailant took them to a remote location
where he repeatedly raped toby &apos;s sister
and then bludgeoned her to death .
but he let toby live .
his mother just told us that toby confessed
to not screaming or running
because he actually liked watching .
he said it aroused him .
it was a single @-@ event imprint . that was his trigger .
then we &apos;re dealing with two psychopaths .
and if they &apos;re both at the boathouse location ,
then neither one of them &apos;s going to go quietly .
here .
oh , please .
it &apos;s ok .
oh , please , just let me go , please .
he &apos;s gone now .
it &apos;s ok . he &apos;s just a--
he &apos;s just a hard @-@ headed little kid .
he didn &apos;t know better .
i guess that reflects poorly on me .
um ... i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s just , uh ...
ah , ok .
but he did tell me what a bitch you were to him .
and despite what you just saw ,
i cared very deeply for that boy .
no ...
so ...

with the mouth sewn shut .

&quot; is not just to share your own riches ,
but to reveal to him his own . &quot;
