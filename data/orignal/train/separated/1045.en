Neal.
Ellen.
You and your father.
My mom told me he was dead.
But you told me the truth.
He was a dirty cop... And he's not dead.
Ms. Parker, you were Neal's father's partner.
That's it, isn't it?
Agent Burke, I'm in WITSEC for a good reason.
These marshals are here to take Neal Caffrey into custody
He'll work for me in D.C. permanently.
You broke the rules.
I go back to work,
and you're placed under review and reassigned?
I'm sure it's only temporary.
It's the evidence warehouse, and it's the best I could do.
The marshals are shipping me off in a few weeks.
Everything I grew up believing was wrong,
and I ran before I got to hear the full story.
I want to know who he was.
When my dad went away, Ellen looked after me.
You grew up in witness protection.
I was 3 when the marshals took us away.
What happened?
We found a gun with his prints on it.
He killed a cop?
It was a long time ago.
I need to know who I am.
Agent Patterson.
Watching you, Caffrey.
Always good to see you, sir.
Patterson's not the only one keeping an eye on me.
Black-market prosthetics off a raid on the docks.
Counterfeit eyeballs -- very Rat Pack.
Hmm?
Sammy Davis Jr. had a glass eye.
We got to get you back to White Collar.
Oh, tell me about it. What's in the bag?
Oh, I made a detour on my way to the bank
to pick you up Manhattan's best sandwich.
Why did you go to the bank?
You don't want to know where I got the sandwich?
Marginally less interesting.
First FBI check since I got back.
Put it in my rainy-day account.
Rainy-day account?
Well, with what I get paid, all I can afford is an umbrella.
Cute.
Good morning.
What can I do for you?
How did you leave things with Sara?
Non sequitur. Why?
Look behind you.
I'm an insurance investigator with sterling-bosch.
I'm here to see Agent Burke.
Sara.
Neal. How was your island adventure?
You know, it was kind of like rum punch.
Seemed like a good idea at the time un--
Until the hangover?
Yeah.
Yeah. Hi, Peter.
Sara. What brings you down here?
I'm working the Covington settlement.
Grant Covington-- hedge funder we targeted
during the sweep on insider trading last year.
We were getting close until he died.
Scuba diving in the Hamptons.
Forfeiture Units seized all illegal gains,
and we closed the case.
Well, I'm cleaning it up on our end.
His death was ruled accidental, so...
The young widow gets the insurance money.
How much?
$50 million.
Unless I can prove she doesn't deserve it.
Now, the NYPD ruled her out as a suspect, but--
You think Sophie Covington pulled one over on everyone?
Well, you're the connoisseur on crimes of persuasion.
That's what I want you to tell me.
And you're the expert on the case.
Now, there's a memorial at 1:00
marking the anniversary of Covington's death.
Who's up for a stakeout?
Neal has errands to run,
but that doesn't mean you can't pick my brain
over Manhattan's best sandwich.
Then I'll take over.
Fill in.
Fill in.
Thank you.
60 minutes, Burke.
Great.
Well, the paparazzi are still interested.
A 21-gun salute-- that's what his will said.
Mmm, nice to see a year after his death,
Covington's ego lives on.
Mmm, that is a good sandwich.
Now that the death certificate's been issued,
Sophie's giving Covington his elaborate sendoff.
Maybe for the second time.
Think she made sure that dive was his last?
Well, she certainly had a lot to gain from his death.
That's Wilson Mailer, Covington's hedge-fund partner.
Suspected he was dirty, too, but nothing stuck.
Ohh, she didn't like that.
That's a familiar touch for a married man.
Oh, Covington's rocky marriage was all over the gossip rags
when we were investigating them.
El leaves them in the bathroom.
Well, perhaps that's why Sophie's so reclusive.
This is the first time I've had eyes on her
outside of a boardroom.
He's keeping his distance.
Yeah.
He's too far away to be a curious bystander
and too subtle to be paparazzi.
Neal, you've hardly said a word.
Are you sure you're up for this?
Ellen agreed to help me look into my father
before she disappears into WITSEC again.
It's now or never. There she is.
Hello.
How are you?
Good.
Good.
After all this time,
I thought you two should know each other.
You must be Mozzie.
Charmed.
Is it safe for you out here?
Oh, as far as anyone's concerned, I'm, uh, long gone.
Uh, wild guess-- both of them are named marshal.
Before I leave town,
I think it's time you met my old friend Sam.
I contacted him after we talked last.
Sam? Did he know my father?
He did. He's a cop -- undercover for a long time.
A hard guy to get hold of.
What was going on in my department was bigger than your dad.
Sam was helping me get evidence on... the others.
Others?
When your dad confessed, you, your mom, and I
were thrown into WITSEC,
And there was no time to look for answers.
Work with Sam. Maybe you'll find what I wanted to,
That he wasn't a bad guy.
I just want to know the truth.
You want to help me finish planting?
I would love to, but I got to get back to work.
I, on the other hand, am known
for my work with Yamadori bonsai.
That's true.
Oh, forget-me-nots-- a fitting au revoir.
Look after her, okay?
I will.
I'll see you soon.
You're a dear.
Thank you again.
Let me get you some gloves.
Oh, sure.
Our delicate hands are roughly the same size.
We're at the southeast corner by the monument.
Neal?
Yep.
He scorched a lot of earth
when he left for his island adventure.
A little smoke damage here, but I wasn't totally unprepared.
You knew he was gonna run?
Something I've learned--
things get stolen, and people go away.
Most of the time, you don't get them back.
Detail, attention!
Pull and hold.
Wonder if he got a permit for that.
Make ready! Aim!
Sophie's leaving before it's over.
Fire!
Not quite the grieving widow.
Make ready!
Aim! Fire!
Make ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Make ready!
Aim! Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
I think you just saved my life.
You could be right. You okay?
Sophie, over here!
Wait up, Sophie!
I have to go. I have to go.
Hey! Wait a second!
This way, ma'am. Come on.
Sophie, excuse me!
Stay back!
Hey, you all right? What happened?
Somebody tried to grab Sophie.
Looks like your insurance-fraud case
just turned attempted kidnapping.
Well, you can add theft to that list.
She stole my hat.
第四季第四集
Something didn't seem alright
so we get out of the car.
I saw Neal start to run, got there as fast as I could,
But the guy was gone.
It was a faded blue, grayish van,
no plates.
That's all I saw.
Reporters captured a few photos of Caffrey's hat,
but nothing we can use.
It all happened too fast. Thanks, Peter.
Yep.
You'll be back.
Shouting down at us like Alexander the Great.
I see myself more as a Caesar.
You say Roman. I say Greek.
Burke, what are you doing here?
Just gave Diana my statement.
The Covington widow.
Kidnappings are usually personal.
Okay, all right.
We should send somebody...
Caffrey, give us a minute, please.
...out there who knows every--
Peter, justice is still reviewing your case.
Covington is an active investigation.
You need to back off.
I was lead on that investigation for a year.
I know.
I could consult outside my hours at the evidence warehouse.
No investigating, no field work.
Tap me like a geyser.
I'll make a call as long as you keep it to that.
You said you were gonna make a call.
You want me to do it right now?
I'd appreciate that.
Why were you leaving the memorial?
I was overwhelmed.
My driver had the car waiting around the corner.
Who runs after nearly being kidnapped?
Someone who feels like they're being chased.
Figures you'd side with the fleeing suspect.
You know, the thing about fleeing suspects is,
they can't say goodbye... to anyone.
Well, that's on the "Lam 101."
You know why I had to run.
I do.
And just so you know,
The world did not stop spinning without you.
Miss Covington, I know it's been a rough day,
but we do want to help you.
Do you?
When the FBI investigated my husband,
my life was turned inside out.
After he died, that wretched insurance investigator
all but accused me of murder.
Think she's talking about you?
I've heard worse.
We're all just trying to do our jobs here.
You'll have to excuse me,
but I've had my fill of law-enforcement types.
Hey, don't you need to get back to evidence?
Convinced the brass to let me consult on all things Covington.
They made you a consultant?
Do you have a radius?
I have a badge.
One last question --
What is the nature of your relationship with Will Mailer?
You do not get to ask me about my personal life.
Ooh, touchy subject. Can I see that?
Any more questions, you can contact my lawyer.
And call off your tail. I'm sick of being followed.
We don't have surveillance on her.
Neither does Sterling-Bosch.
That guy we saw lurking around the memorial --
He's got to be involved.
Sophie's done with the FBI.
Oh, but I bet she would talk with
the dashing stranger
that saved her life.
Yeah, I could find out what's really going on
between her and Mailer.
If someone is tailing her, we can get a look.
What are you thinking?
Come with me.
Okay.
All right, you sure she won't recognize you
from your investigation into her husband?
We never met in person.
All right, set me up.
I hope this wasn't too disruptive.
Oh, it's not a problem. I'm just happy I could help out.
It's you.
You okay?
I was just giving my statement to Agent Burke here.
Yes, thank you for your time,
Mr...Armstrong.
Uh, Neal.
Well, at least now I know your name.
Yeah. Neal Armstrong.
Like the astronaut.
One small step for man.
Sophie Covington.
Nice to meet you.
I don't know how to thank you for what you did.
If there's ever anything that I can do,
just please let me know.
Actually, there is.
Can I get my hat back?
I don't have it here.
We could meet for coffee or...
This is my address. Come by around 4:00.
And I'll have it waiting for you.
All right.
If I can help you in any way, please give me a call.
He's one of the good guys.
Are you --
One more thing to discuss with Agent Burke.
See you at 4:00.
Bye.
Neal Armstrong?
Well, uh, arms, arms --
All those prosthetics in the evidence warehouse.
A-at least it's better than Neal Handleman.
No, it's not. I like Neal Handleman.
I should have gone with Eyes-enhauer.
That would have been good.
This is Mr. Mailer.
Just here to pick up my hat.
Ah, the knight in shining armor.
More of a right place, right time kind of thing.
Mr. Armstrong, it's good to see you.
Call me Neal, please.
Neal, it's good to see you.
Goodbye, Will.
Hope I'm not interrupting.
I didn't realize you'd have a friend over.
Will's not a friend.
He was my husband's business partner.
So, tell me, Neal,
are you a professional kidnapping interventionist or...
No, I'm an entrepreneur.
I've done well over the years,
and I enjoy finding worthy causes to give back to.
I used to teach public school. I -- after I met Grant,
I started a charity for art programs.
The more I made, the more I gave away,
which was just something else for us to fight about.
You have a beautiful home.
Thank you. I spend a lot of time here.
The media attention, it's just --
Why you took my hat.
Yes, that's why I took your hat.
Hmm, vintage.
I almost hate to give it back.
Oh, nice.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Speaking of vintage, um...
Would you like a glass of wine or...
I'd love one.
Okay.
I backpacked the Costa Brava after college.
This Rioja reminds me of it.
To spanish wine.
To hats.
So, how does this count as consulting?
Confirming I.D.
That's the same guy I saw at the memorial.
You know, I feel like I'm being followed.
Yeah, we're tailing your tail.
Lose him so we can follow him home.
You're asking me to give up trade secrets?
Call your patent lawyer.
Just a minute.
One second.
Gun! FBI! FBI!
Don't hurt me!
Calm down, or you're gonna hurt yourself!
Okay, okay.
Freddy Slavkin.
What were you doing at the covington memorial today?
Someone hire you to grab Sophie?
Didn't get the job done,
so you thought they were coming after you?
What? No. No, no, no.
So you usually answer the door like that?
I thought I was dealing with disgruntled husbands.
You don't strike me as the romantic type. Explain.
I'm a P.I. I work infidelity cases.
A lot of what I find tends to make people want to kill me.
Who hired you to tail sophie?
You pulled a weapon on a federal agent.
You are way past client confidentiality.
Woman named Poppy Mailer.
Mailer's wife.
She hired you to find out
if he's having an affair with Sophie Covington.
Is he?
Uh, spent six months trying to confirm,
but so far zip.
Mrs. Mailer's obsessed.
She wants to know everything about Sophie.
Who comes, who goes -- she wants it all.
You take any photos today?
Th-they're in the printer.
I haven't gone through them yet.
Old-school.
You got a shot of the kidnapper.
Good thing we're collecting evidence today.
I need everything you have on Sophie Covington.
O-over there.
All that and no proof of an affair,
and she still keeps you on retainer.
Me and her psychic.
Sophie Covington -- what is she like?
From what I saw,
she's not into murder, money, or Mailer.
So she's not the gold-digging,
social-climbing husband murderer that I read about?
No. I think she's lonely.
Well, she's not a shopper, but Mailer is.
Handbags, jewelry, flowers.
Big spender for a guy who's low on money.
Mailer's cellphone --
he calls Sophie, but she doesn't call back.
All right, these are Sophie's movements at the memorial.
Sophie gets there. Mailer's waiting.
He touches her. She pulls away. She leaves.
I don't see Mailer anywhere over here.
He's in the earlier shots but not the later ones.
Because he's our kidnapper.
From Freddy's file,
same red stripe on the glove.
All right, not definitive,
but what if Mailer and Covington
ran their insider-trading scheme together?
FBI's closing in,
so Mailer pins it all on Covington.
Sabotaged his diving equipment and kills him.
But he realizes Sophie's gonna get the insurance payout,
so he seduces her.
She's not having it.
He decides to grab her at the memorial. Why?
He could force her to
transfer the money to an offshore account.
Pay her own ransom.
It's basically a white-collar mugging.
Sophie wouldn't have gotten out of that van alive.
Mailer was at her place today.
If we're right, he's gonna try again.
Sophie likes you.
If Mailer thinks someone else is going to steal that fortune
before he does--
No, no, no.
I'm not that guy. I can't con a widow.
You can if it's to save her.
We force Mailer to act, and we nail him.
Well, how do we convince him that we're an item?
Freddy.
Good.
Freddy takes incriminating photos of you and Sophie.
Mrs. Mailer will not be able to resist using those
to turn the screws on her husband.
Come on. It's what we pay you the rainy-day bucks for.
Come on, information.
I told you, he's unique.
So is Bob Saget. That tells me nothing.
Mozzie invited me over to play cards.
That explains the marshals trying to blend in out front.
Ellen has so little time left in the city,
I thought she should spend it with friends.
That's awfully charitable of you for a weekday.
Well, I do have ulterior motives.
I want to know more about you as a child.
I'm not talking.
Come on, give me something.
He forged his school I.D.
He, uh, conned the bullies out of their milk money.
Wore ties to preschool.
No ties, but there was always a little con man in him.
I knew that.
Talent like his is born. It's not made.
Come on, a "For instance."
Okay, Neal loved school,
but his mother wasn't, uh --
Punctual. She was a mess.
She never got me to school on time.
So, first, he broke in and adjusted the school clock
so that class started 30 minutes later.
Mind you, this was when he was in second grade.
Okay, that could not have worked.
No, it didn't. So then he tried barricading the roads
and rerouting the school bus to run past his house.
That actually worked for a few days.
Then he got smart
and started forging his own city bus passes.
I was never late again.
Ooh, speaking of,
I can't keep my shining knights waiting.
I should go.
Great to see you.
I'll let you know when I hear from sam, hmm?
Okay.
Bye-bye, Ellen.
Bye, Mozzie. Thanks for letting me win.
See you soon.
Thanks, Moz.
Ah, she's a nice lady.
She's really gonna miss New York.
We all do. It's a hard city to leave.
Now, you came in with a suit-induced frown.
Can I help?
Peter wants me to con a widow.
Well, widows fall into two categories --
the bereaved and the relieved.
Which kind does he have you duping?
The kind with the $50-million bull's-eye on her back.
Sophie Covington?
Is she the killer?
No, she's not.
And I need to convince a P.I.
that she and I are romantically involved.
Well, that shouldn't be too hard, cheekbones.
Don't ever call me that again.
I want you to tell the P.I. who I am,
who I've always been.
A con man?
Exactly.
While you do what?
Mr. Armstrong.
Tony.
Neal.
Hey. What are you doing here?
Oh, all that talk of Spain last night
reminded me of Cadaqués --
rocky beaches, artists' colonies,
best seafood I ever had.
That is a paella pan.
How would you like to go to the costa brava
without leaving the house?
Fellow ornithologist.
What kind of bird you watching?
The kind that steals nest eggs and flies south real fast.
Man's got something on his mind besides the hat.
"Maltese falcon."
All true.
So, what were you doing in Cadaqués?
Just passing through on my way from France.
Found the Dali Museum very challenging.
All right. Hope you're hungry.
Best halal cart in the city.
Want?
I'll take your word for it.
You know, your guy just started coming around.
Oh, probably smells the greenbacks.
You may have heard of him --
Nick Halden, George Devore...
Neal Armstrong.
Con man.
Oh, world class.
This is really nice.
It's one of my favorites.
No, I mean this -- staying in, making lunch.
Never did that when I was married.
Your husband wasn't into cooking?
Turns out we actually didn't have that much in common.
I admit I jumped in without looking,
but you make a choice and --
And suddenly, you're living a life
you never thought you'd have.
Been there -- a couple times.
This the gala for your charity?
Yeah.
I was gonna go, donate the insurance settlement.
All of it?
I don't feel right having it,
but I'm not ready to go back out there,
so I'll just send a check.
You know, not long ago, I took off for a while.
Thought a break from New York was what I needed.
And then a friend helped me find a way to get my life back.
Wasn't easy, but...
It was worth it.
I should go.
Can you walk me out?
Sure.
Guess this is goodbye?
Guess it is.
Okay.
Bye, Sophie.
Bye.
Forget something?
Oh, it looks better on you,
but I should probably hang on to it.
Yeah.
All right.
All right.
Must have been a hell of a paella.
Yeah, I went for the hug. Sophie upped it to a kiss.
Yeah, and you couldn't deny the kiss
'cause you were working.
Whatever it takes to get the job done.
Good hustle.
Thank you.
Where'd you get these?
Envelope on my doorstep,
along with an invoice for five hours of P.I. work
to be paid in cash.
Honest day's work for Moz.
Yeah, for a change.
Did you set up an auto alert on mailer's bank account?
Poppy withdraws anything more than 100 bucks,
Will Mailer gets a text message.
And?
Worked like a charm.
We set up surveillance in Freddy's building.
She took out money. He got curious and followed her.
This gets good.
Poppy, what the hell is going on?
You followed me?!
You are going through money like water!
Why don't you take a look at this, Will?
Your whore has found herself another man.
You put a P.I. on Sophie?
How long has this been going on?
Long enough to know what a bastard I married.
You know what the best part is?
Hat man is after her money.
Looks like Moz earned his pay.
Mm-hmm, when he gets me his social-security number.
Hello?
Sophie, hi.
I think we've found our widow of opportunity.
Get it? Dropped the "N."
Mm, that...
Sophie invited Caffrey to escort her to the gala.
It's already hit the websites. Mailer will know.
If Mailer's plan is to grab Sophie,
This is his chance.
We'll have agents at all points of entry --
Perimeter surrounding the building, outside her house.
If Mailer makes a move, we're ready.
We'll track you in the limo via cell signal.
All right, gear up. Head out.
Jones, take off Caffrey's anklet.
Where's Peter?
Evidence. Nothing left to consult on.
He should be here. - Don't worry, Caffrey --
I'll be there to keep an eye on you.
Ever tell you how much I hate that van?
Everyone in position.
Eyes on Mailer. Call it in.
That man is not happy.
Well, the van will do that to you.
Caffrey better be on his best behavior.
Caffrey's on route.
Sorry I kept you waiting.
Don't worry about it. You look beautiful.
Tony, how are we doing for time?
Oh, we should be all right, Miss Covington.
What's wrong? You seem distracted.
I'm admiring Tony's watch.
That the new Fathom 20?
It is.
Pricy.
Was it worth it?
I think so.
You think I'd look good with a watch like Tony's?
I'm not sure it would suit you?
But you don't really know me, do you?
Why do you think we met?
I don't know -- happy coincidence.
Or rescuing you turned out to be the perfect way in.
In? What are you talking about?
When I was at your place,
you told me you felt bad about having all that money.
I wanted to help. So I took it off your hands.
You took it?
Your banking information wasn't hard to find.
You stole $50 million from her?
Yeah, there it goes.
Just put $50 million into my rainy-day account.
You were gonna give it away.
Tony, call the police.
Tony doesn't work for you anymore.
That watch means Tony can be bought.
He knows how to follow the money.
Maybe he wants to come work for me.
She's got a party to get to.
Let her out.
By the time you call that FBI Agent Burke,
we'll be long gone.
No one's making any calls.
I'm sorry, Miss Covington.
Give me your phone and get out -- now.
What are you...?
You make me sick!
Was any of it real?
Go.
I need your phone, too.
You have the money?
I said I did.
That was a bad idea.
We'll see about that.
Stop staring at me.
Help me get through this, we can go home to the wives.
Scale of worst evidence you've handled,
how bad is this?
Oh, it's nothing.
The snakes -- that was bad.
I hate snakes.
Peter Burke.
Agent Burke, this is Sophie Covington.
Sophie, you all right?
You said to call you if I needed help.
I need help.
The man that saved my life --
Neal?
He stole my money.
Is that a personal call?
Where is he now?
He's with Tony, my driver.
They -- they forced me out of my car,
and he took my phone.
All right, Sophie, this is very important.
What exactly did Neal say to you?
He said he put my husband's life-insurance money
into his rainy-day account.
He said that -- rainy-day account?
He said that by the time I called you,
he'd be long gone.
He mentioned me by name?
That's how I remembered you'd given me your card.
He said he took $50 million,
but I don't have that much money.
Sophie, you're gonna be okay.
Stay where you are.
Where are you going?
Burke, where are you going?
One step out that door, I write you up.
It goes on your record.
Burke, where are you going?
To cross the line.
Saw a picture of you with Sophie Covington.
You move fast.
Why not? She's a nice girl.
With a lot of money. You screwed me.
Twice.
But today, you forgot your lucky hat.
You don't need luck when you got a plan.
Time to tell me who the hell you really are.
My name's Neal Caffrey.
I'm the best thing that ever happened to you.
Caffrey's signal's still not up.
Pull traffic cams for all routes
from the Covington residence.
Right away, sir.
Hey, Peter! What are you doing?
You weren't authorized to...
Neal is in trouble.
What the hell's going on?
Are you tracking his phone?
Well, the signal dropped. We're working on it.
This op's gone off the rails. Mailer's not coming.
He paid off Sophie's driver.
She and Caffrey both got grabbed?
Yeah, but Neal managed to get her out of the car.
Sophie called me. She's safe,
but he's on his own.
Any idea where he is?
No, but I think I know how to get him out of there.
This way.
I thought it'd be best if you filled her in.
All yours.
Sophie...
Neal works for the FBI.
We sent him undercover to protect you.
He said that he siphoned the life-insurance money from you,
but he didn't.
Then why would he say that?
To get you out of the car.
He figured out Tony had been paid off to abduct you.
Paid off by who?
Wilson Mailer tried to kidnap you.
He's after the insurance payout.
Oh, my god.
I got here as fast as I could.
How do we get Caffrey out of there?
He passed me a message through Sophie.
We need to put the entire insurance settlement
in Neal's bank account.
$25 million from each of you.
Sure you got that message right?
Yeah. I know Neal.
Sara, I'm sure you can get authorization for that.
You want 15%?
It's a good deal.
For you.
Better deal for me is kill you and keep all of it.
I can't transfer the money if I'm dead.
You kill me, you've got a body to get rid of.
I've been seen with Sophie.
She thinks I stole the money.
I'm your face man.
You believe in luck, you can push yours,
or you pay me enough money to disappear,
and it's a win-win.
What keeps you from turning me in?
May I?
Think a guy with a wanted poster is gonna go to the law?
So, your plan is to put $50 million
into the personal bank account of a con man
who recently fled to a remote island
with no extradition?
So that he can transfer it to a financial genius
who will have made every effort
to make sure that we can't trace it.
Yep.
It's your money, ladies.
He saved my life. I'm in.
He must have a plan.
10%, and you have a deal.
I can work with that.
Do the transfer.
Sara, in or out?
Okay.
I'm in, too.
Okay.
All right, Tony's paid off,
I'm not saying anything,
and you're a much richer man than I am.
It's a pleasure doing business with someone
who sets the bar so high.
Means something coming from you.
I got to ask-- Grant Covington--
How did you pull that off?
Oxygen tank?
Switched out the regulator valve.
Just like that, nothing left behind.
If it weren't for that P.I.
and his photos, I wouldn't have to run.
You've seen them, right?
There are none of you?
Nothing left behind.
Guess you really are a lucky man.
Think I could get my phone back?
We should have heard from him by now.
Yeah.
Neal?
Well, the good news is, I'm alive.
That is good news.
Wait, is there bad news?
Depends on whether you're a "glass half full"
or a "glass half empty" kind of person.
You lost half the money?
Or a glass 10% full.
Mailer has 90%?!
Sometimes in life, you have to cut a deal.
Any other good news?
Yeah.
Mailer's headed to Freddy's to destroy the evidence.
We don't have much time.
I send you, it's both our asses on the line.
Yeah.
Neal, I'm on my way.
FBI!
Show me your hands. Drop the weapon.
Nice gloves. They look familiar.
It's kind of warm out there for those, isn't it?
Yeah, it's a beautiful day.
Turn around.
Wilson Mailer, you're under arrest.
Good thing we were behind that door.
Guy who lives here would have shot you.
Sophie, the things I said in the limo--
You don't need to apologize.
Listen, you asked me if any of it was real.
A lot of it was.
You saved my life.
And made you some paella.
And you saved my life again.
Thank you... Neal Armstrong.
Neal Armstrong-- definitely not real.
Yeah, kind of figured.
Sure made for a great story, though.
We made the window
for forensics to track the bank transfer.
Money's been recovered,
and it looks like they can prove
Mailer tampered with Covington's regulator.
We can also get him on murder.
Handed you an inch,
you sprinted to the finish line.
Caffrey did the same thing.
The two of you...
Careful, Peter.
I don't want you to wake up one day
and not recognize yourself.
They made a decision?
"It is our recommendation that he be reinstated
as special agent in charge
of the Manhattan White Collar Division."
"Effective immediately."
Congratulations, honey.
Thanks.
Congrats, Peter.
It'll be good to have you back in the office.
And we're not just saying that
because we get to hand Caffrey back to you.
Well, I wouldn't be here if it weren't for all of you.
You make me look good.
To Peter Burke.
The man we all wish we could be more like.
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!
Let me get over here.
Shake my boss's hand. Yeah.
Team's back together the way it should be.
Refill?
Yes, lots to celebrate.
Peter's back.
Sophie's safe.
And you're mad at me.
Come on. Truth.
Oh, Neal, I was.
You had a right.
After everything you did for me, I--
Neal, it's not about you.
That's very mature.
I told you about Emily.
Your sister.
One day, I'm yelling at her for borrowing my clothes,
and the next--
She ran away.
You leaving like that-- it opened up some old wounds.
You know, she's out there somewhere.
I just wish I knew where.
You deserve to know.
Don't we all?
Ellen!
No! I'm family! I'm family!
I'm family!
They found me.
Who? Who did this to you?
Trust Sam.
All right, she's in respiratory arrest! We got to go!
I want to come with you.
Let us do our job, okay?
