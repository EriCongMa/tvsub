katie !

yeah .
yeah ?
he &apos;s the coolest ever .
he &apos;s what ?
the coolest ever .
coolest ever ?
you know , a less secure father might take that personally .
i always considered myself to be
the coolest ever .
no ? okay , i guess i &apos;m wrong . go ahead .
come in !
uncle matt ?
who &apos;s the greatest uncle in the whole wide world ?
uncle matt !
is this for me ?
no . this is for your dad .
hurricane matty strikes again . huh ?
hey . what &apos;d i tell you about spoiling her ?
i am not spoiling her .
you &apos;re not ?
no .
okay . a little bit .
come here , i love you . been too long , huh ?
hasn &apos;t been that long .
no , it actually has .
my going @-@ away party was a year ago .
no , you have not been out here for a year .
i know , it feels like ten .
i can &apos;t believe that you came
all the way to hawaii .
yeah . well ...
she &apos;s worth it .
how &apos;s things with rachel ?
they are , uh ...
they &apos;re getting better .
we actually have conversations , and i don &apos;t feel like
a blood vessel &apos;s gonna explode out of my neck , so that &apos;s good .
progress .
yeah , absolutely .
so ? why the , uh , why the sudden visit ?
you &apos;re on business , right ?
what do you mean ? what , a guy can &apos;t drop in on his bro ?
no . a guy can drop in on his bro , but not you , okay ?
&apos;cause last time you dropped in on me ,
you crashed dad &apos;s car into a tree .
let the iroc go , danny . okay ? i came here to have fun .
proof . right here .
we are going to swim with dolphins ,
we are going to feed sharks ,
hot air ballooning .
this place has everything .
yeah , they got everything .
i mean , they got tsunamis ,
they got giant centipedes ...
you know what your problem is ? your issue ?
lack of adventurous spirit .
you &apos;re a spoilsport ! am i right , gracie ?
yeah .
hold on a second .
alright ? now we need all this today .
sounds like fun .
when ? okay .
guys , i got bad news .
i gotta go to work . grace , gotta take you back to mom , okay ?
wait a second . she can hang with me .
you &apos;re gonna babysit ?
yeah .
we can hang out for the day ,
and then we &apos;ll meet you for dinner .
what do you think , gracie ?
all right . but listen , no funny stuff .
no trouble , okay ?
i won &apos;t .
i know you won &apos;t . i &apos;m talking to him .
all right . come on .
i &apos;ll see you guys later . stay out of trouble .
we need to cause trouble , right now . yes .
i heard that .
chin .
hey , listen , i think we need to expand the grid search
to a half @-@ mile radius .
what did you find ?
the end of the zip line here , it &apos;s all charred ,
and there &apos;s a , uh ... a residue , a film , all over it .
you think it was an explosive ?
yeah , i do .
could &apos;ve been a shape charge that went high order .
i also found evidence of an electronic trigger .
probably short @-@ wave .
somebody blew the zip line out , chin ,
and they had to have been close by to do it .
okay . i &apos;ll see what i can find .
we know this is hard , but ...
can you tell us about the phone call ?
it was an unknown number .
he had a thin , raspy voice .
didn &apos;t recognize it .
he knew i was a judge .
he called me &quot; your honor . &quot;
i think he was watching us .
one minute katie was waving good @-@ bye ...
then the next ...
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;ve got to excuse me .
single father , one kid .
yeah . he just lost the only family he had .
do you think the daughter was a target , or just ...
collateral damage ?
no , i think from the phone call
the father was definitely the target .
i think the killer was taunting him .
he knew his name , his number , exactly where he &apos;d be .
definitely premeditated .
i want a full protective detail on the judge , 24 / 7 .
for all we know , this whack job &apos;s not done .
so i found these tire tracks
in an area that &apos;s usually off limits to vehicles .
they &apos;re recent , and they &apos;re well within sight of the platform .
you get a hit from the hpd database ?
yeah .
according to the size , depth ,
and tread pattern , it looks like our suspect
was driving a late @-@ model suv or a light pickup .
once we get a suspect , we can pull a match .
okay , danny .
any luck tracing the phone call to the judge ?
no , the phone &apos;s a burner . completely untraceable .
but , uh , the hpd bomb squad
they checked out the fragments that you found ,
and they said it &apos;s from an rf receiver
usually found in walkie @-@ talkies or remote @-@ controlled cars .
they &apos;re doing chemical analysis on the explosives right now .
kono , what do you got ?
i &apos;ve been trying to get a hold of the judge &apos;s threat file ,
but the deputy prosecutor &apos;s been in court all day .
threat file ?
the prosecutor &apos;s office
has a team of investigators whose sole job is to keep track
of any written or verbal threats against the bench .
basically , just weed out the whack jobs , right ?
so depending on how heavy the threat ,
they either do or do not pass it on to the feds .
so what we &apos;re looking for right now is someone
who matches our killer &apos;s profile so far :
male , violent , history with explosives ,
and an axe to grind .
makes sense . with cops , judges ,
anyone who puts away hardened criminals ,
suspect pool &apos;s going to be pretty deep .
okay , so if we &apos;re focusing on violent felony cases
the judge has presided over , how deep is this pool
that we &apos;re talking about ?
okay . uh , we need to whittle this down .
in the meantime , let &apos;s make sure judge kamalei &apos;s
personal security detail has a picture of every one of these guys .
when this killer comes back for the judge ,
we &apos;re going to be ready .
yeah . all right . thanks , chin .
hpd is in place . the judge is secure .
kono and i are going to go see deputy prosecutor chen tomorrow ,
try to narrow down our suspects .
we &apos;ll take all the help we can get .
you know , i really appreciate this escort through the hilton .
i &apos;m just stopping in to pick up grace .
it &apos;s no big deal . besides , i want to meet your brother .
well , be warned .
mr. wall street has quite a personality .
runs in the family , huh ?
disorder . personality dis ... order .
hey , rach . what are you doing here ?
mmm , it &apos;s nice to see you , too , daniel .
i invited her . come on , it &apos;s been a long time
since we &apos;ve had a family meal .
it &apos;ll be just like old times .

he did not !
not every time .
okay , danny , tell them about the time at the zoo .
again with the ... every time with the zoo .
okay ? you were ... he was causing a disturbance .
you handcuffed me to the monkey cages .
hey , i ... i was doing my job .
danny , you were nine ! what are you talking about ?
they were plastic handcuffs . just so you know .
so you were a cop back then ?
oh , yeah . my parents would say , you know ,
&quot; where &apos;s , uh , where &apos;s your brother ? &quot; danny would say ,
&quot; guess we lost him . &quot;
you are horrible , daniel .
oh , i always would come back for you , didn &apos;t i ?
you know what , take my hand .
didn &apos;t i , huh ?
that is true .
if you remembered where you left me .
i love you .
look at this ... look at this little cutie @-@ patootie .
oh , my gosh . i know , she is so tired .
she drank several , several sodas .
i don &apos;t know how she &apos;s asleep .
see these two guys over rachel &apos;s right shoulder ?
goofy aloha shirt and cheap shoes ?
yeah .
look like feds , huh ?
they watching us ?
i don &apos;t know .
guy on the right walked out of my brother &apos;s room
in a waiter outfit earlier today .
really ?
yeah .
looks like they &apos;re getting up .
what do you want to do ?
say hello ?
i think we should say hello .
hey , uh , we &apos;ll be right back .
all right .
one second .
okay .
gentlemen. special agent edward kipton .
this is special agent adam markowitz .
fbi . we know .
what do you want with my brother ?
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s an active investigation .
you know how it is .
oh , okay .
um , listen , we have , on this island , what is called ...
what does the government call it ?
it &apos;s called full immunity and means .
full immunity and means .
so ...
i &apos;ll give her a call .
just do yourself a favor , okay , and just tell me
why you &apos;re following my brother . we don &apos;t have to do all this .
governor jameson please .
right , you have the governor on speed dial ?
exactly .
hello , governor .
yes , ma &apos;am .
no , i &apos;m standing with a couple of fbi agents here
who are refusing to share information about a case .
why are you smiling ? he &apos;s not kidding .
he did this to me .
no . yes , ma &apos;am . no , we tried . mm @-@ hmm .
yes , ma &apos;am .
it &apos;s for you .
okay .
who is this ?
yeah , right . it &apos;s good .
my name ? kipton . edward kipton .
yes . yes , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;m terribly sorry . of course .
of course .
now , answer the man &apos;s question .
matthew williams is the focus of a federal investigation .
he &apos;s being accused of defrauding his investors
out of millions of dollars .
whoa . defrauding ?
no , no , no , that &apos;s impossible .
not according to the sec
and the dozen forensic accountants
they have going through his books .
okay , well , you and you and the sec
are all wrong , okay ?
my brother runs a hedge fund .
and contrary to the talking heads on television ,
that does not make him a thief , you understand ?
we &apos;re not here to argue .
our job is to make sure
that your brother doesn &apos;t take his vacation overseas
before the indictment comes down .
so ...
indictment ?
... if you hear anything about his travel plans ,
i &apos;d appreciate it if you &apos;d give us a call , okay ?
and , danny , if you say anything to your brother ,
we will prosecute you for obstruction .
i &apos;m sure you will .
see if your fairy godmother can get you out of that .
listen to me . i know my kid brother , okay .
he &apos;s a lot of things , but he is not a criminal .
okay , okay .
maybe he was set up .
yeah , maybe .
listen to me , all right ,
let me tell you something about my brother , okay ?
when rachel and i split up , all right ,
i took a room at a motel right down the block ,
because i wanted to be close to grace .
this two @-@ star dump .
my brother-- every single night ,
he would come over with a six @-@ pack of beer
and all the time in the world .
never once , not one time ,
did i catch him looking at his watch , okay ?
he just sat there talk to me every single night .
he &apos;d fall asleep sitting up in a chair .
wake up the next morning , go straight to work .
every day , okay , for six months he did this .
for six months
he talked me off the ledge , all right ?
i &apos;m telling you , i would not have gotten through that
if it wasn &apos;t for him , okay ?
he didn &apos;t do this .
okay . all right , fine .
you ... you got to talk to him .
yeah . i just don &apos;t think that this is a one @-@ time conversation .
that &apos;s fine .
listen , you talk to him , take all the time you need .
family &apos;s first , right ?
there he is .
steve , i &apos;d like you to meet deputy prosecutor jim chen .
steve mcgarrett . how do you do ?
thanks for meeting me like this .
i &apos;m just on my way to a lunch .
no , no problem .
i appreciate it .
listen , did you get a chance to pull
judge kamalei &apos;s threat file ?
it &apos;s all here .
kamalei &apos;s known as a hanging judge .
put away a lot of violent offenders .
not many get back out on the street .
anyone on here stand out ?
several .
but if i were a betting man ,
i &apos;d say drew parisi fits the m.o.
how so ?
arson conviction .
after his ex dumped him ,
parisi rigged her house to burn down .
i &apos;m sorry , you said he rigged her house ?
this guy has technical skills ?
not only that , jim said apparently this guy was so pissed
when the verdict was delivered ,
he attacked the judge in open court .
it took a bailiff and two armed officers to restrain him .
and he just got paroled ?
three weeks ago .
only in america .
yeah , only in america .
you know his parole officer ?
already spoke to him .
parisi is staying at an old girlfriend &apos;s place in wahiawa .
hey , stop by the house on sunday .
your mother would love to see you .
will do . see you then .
hello .
very sweet .
a lunch with your son .
you must love him very much .
who is this ?
but a pat on the back ?
you should have given him a hug .
please ,
don &apos;t do this .
i hope you said good @-@ bye .
five @-@ o !
show me your hands ! show me your hands !
kyle !
get out of the car !
hey . what did he say about the call ?
same as kamalei .
unknown number , male voice .
&quot; hope you said good @-@ bye . &quot;
you okay ?
yeah , i will be once we find this scumbag .
well , we know it &apos;s not parisi .
no , we were right there with him
at the exact time the bomb went off .
that &apos;s right , and if it was detonated by a remote trigger ,
then the bomber had to have been close by .
right .
is that a piece of the rf receiver ?
yeah , it is . this one &apos;s largely intact ,
and we got a partial serial number right there .
nice . i &apos;ll run it down ,
see if we can find out where it came from .
all right .
hey , how goes the canvass ?
good . got a lot of foot traffic .
tourists taking photos .
so i collected all their cameras and cell phones ,
see what we get .
well , one thing &apos;s for sure .
this isn &apos;t just about judge kamalei anymore .
that &apos;s right .
if we want to figure out who this bomber is ,
we have to look at cases involving kamalei and chen .
my question is , if it &apos;s about revenge ,
why not go after them ?
why target their kids ?
i understand .
yes .
i &apos;m going to see you in a little bit .
yeah . i got to go . i @-@ i &apos;ve got to go .
what &apos;s happening ?
hey . um , i wasn &apos;t expecting to see you for a little bit .
i &apos;m sorry . a guy can &apos;t drop in on his brother ?
i see what you did there-- clever .
thank you .
what are you doing , business ?
uh , that ? uh , new client .
lives up on the north shore .
i thought you were on vacation .
i am . this , uh , this just came up .
who &apos;s , uh ...
who &apos;s this new client ?
uh , clients of mine mentioned my name to him .
he &apos;s , uh , he &apos;s got nine figures .
made a small fortune through the family business .
so now he &apos;s looking for some tax shelter ideas .
what is his family business ?
a little of everything--
shipping , utilities , real estate stuff .
it &apos;s just a coincidence he &apos;s here in hawaii ?
what &apos;s with the third degree , magnum ?
are you looking to poach my client ?
yeah , i &apos;m trying to poach your client .
i &apos;m checking on my little brother &apos;s career .
is that all right ?
checking up on me-- i like that .
apparently , this guy &apos;s on a schedule .
he needs to meet right now , so ...
can we hang later ?
yeah , whatever you need .
all right .
you all right ?
i &apos;m in hawaii , with my big brother .
i &apos;ll see you in a little bit .
all right .
i cross @-@ referenced judge kamalei &apos;s threat file
with cases both he and chen had in common ,
focusing on violent offenders and parolees .
okay , any matches ?
no .
so i started focusing on the cameras
and cell phones i collected from the crime scene .
all right , so several tourists took photos
just before or after the explosion .
all from different angles .
okay , so what you &apos;re saying is
the killer might actually be in here somewhere ?
exactly .
from the size of the tires ,
we &apos;re looking for an suv .
what &apos;s that right there ?
blow that up , kono . put it up here for me .
the wheel wells are all muddy .
what about the treads ?
the tires are a match to
the treads found near the zip line platform .
did you get a clear shot of the plates ?
no . but hey , what &apos;s that ?
that could be a rental tag .
okay , contact every rental company on the island .
i want the name of anybody driving a rental
that make , model and color , okay ?
all right , you got it .
danny , everything okay with your brother ?
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s fine .
i think i &apos;m going to be a little while , though .
why ? what are you going to do ?
i got it . don &apos;t worry about it . it &apos;s nothing .
uh , okay , i know what nothing means , so ...
nothing means nothing , steven , okay ? i &apos;m fine .
okay , you know what , stop , don &apos;t go anywhere .
i &apos;m going to be there soon .
i tracked down this serial number .
it &apos;s to a circuit board for a remote control airplane .
a t @-@ 9 sabrecat .
i hear you &apos;re one of the only shops
on the island that sell &apos; em , yeah ?
yeah .
sell any lately ?
guy came looking to buy last week .
oh , yeah . what he look like ?
haole .
dark hair , goatee .
he was dressed full @-@ on paniolo style ,
boots and everything .
definitely no local .
how you know that ?
the tan lines ,
the clothes .
this cowboy-- he buy any of them ?
three of them .
three ?
yep .
paid in cash .
and get this-- the remote control to that plane
has a range of a thousand feet .
those tire tracks i found near the zip line platform
are well within that .
well , then it looks like we have one less target .
okay , would you please slow down .
you &apos;re getting too close .
danny , relax . he doesn &apos;t know this truck .
that &apos;s a good point .
stop . he &apos;s pulling into that driveway .
yeah , hello . is this waioleka charters ?
yes , thank you .
this is clarence clemons from matthew williams &apos; office .
i &apos;m just calling to check on his itinerary .
no listing ? okay .
hey , could you guys just tell me one more time ,
where do you fly out of ?
kaleola airport .
thank you very much .
this is so sick that i &apos;m doing this .
hands up .
spread your legs .
matthew ...
come . come in .
good to see you .
we have much business to discuss .
what happened ?
you lose the signal ?
yeah . he said he was going to a business meeting .
who pats you down before a business meeting , hmm ?
someone who doesn &apos;t want to get caught .
who is responsible for this suntan lotion job here ?
you missed a huge spot on your nose , monkey .
i didn &apos;t know you were joining us .
sorry , man . slipped my mind .
how did your meeting go ?
really great , yeah . guy wanted
to park $ 30 mil in some tax @-@ free munis .
i &apos;m like , &quot; really ? well , bonds are dead money right now . &quot;
$ 30 mil ? that &apos;s impressive .
what can i say ? i &apos;m good at my job .
time for a swim .
what is it that you do , exactly ?
you just help the rich get out of paying their taxes or what ?
in all fairness , i &apos;d like to get everybody
out of their taxes , not just the rich .
you know , people don &apos;t pay taxes , then cops don &apos;t get paid ,
firefighters like pop .
you ever think about that ?
man , i &apos;m kidding .
come on ! relax ! it &apos;s the beach .
uncle matt !
fish !
where is that fish ? ! let me see it !
i &apos;m coming to get it !
right here ?
and what was that all about ?
what was what all about ?
i assume you &apos;ve heard
the term &quot; passive @-@ aggressive &quot; ?
i wasn &apos;t being passive @-@ aggressive .
no , you were being aggressive @-@ aggressive .
the question is why ?
i don &apos;t know . he just gets under my skin sometimes .
daniel , you can &apos;t lie to me . what &apos;s wrong ?
all right , i &apos;m gonna tell you something .
i need you to keep it between us , okay ?
okay ?
the other night when steve and i left dinner ,
the fbi was watching us .
they &apos;re after matt .
what ?
they claim he &apos;s been scamming his clients
out of their life savings .
apparently , an indictment is on its way .
do you believe he &apos;s guilty ?
i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;m waiting for a callback
from a buddy at the sec .
what does matt have to say about all of this ?
i have not spoken to him about it .
daniel ...
what do you want me to do , rachel ? what do i do ?
it &apos;s an active federal investigation . i &apos;m a cop .
he &apos;s your brother .
wave . wave to them .
hey , i &apos;ll tell you , man .
remember that time at the , uh ... oh , the stone pony ?
we snuck in to see bruce .
and that weird bouncer with the three chicks ?
you want a beer ?
no , i &apos;m good .
hey , i want to , uh ...
i want to talk to you about something .
sit down for a second .
it &apos;s about rachel , isn &apos;t it ?
i knew you still loved her .
i knew by the way
that you looked at her at dinner last night .
i know you .
it &apos;s not about rachel .
so i &apos;m just gonna ask you once ...
and i want you to tell me the truth .
what &apos;s going on with you ?
nothing . why ?
why ? because i spoke to a friend at the sec .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about your indictment .
matt ,
you &apos;ve been stealing money from your clients , huh ?
danny , that ... that &apos;s insane , okay ?
it &apos;s just ... doesn &apos;t even ... - don &apos;t lie to me .
i &apos;m not lying !
listen to me !
who do you think you &apos;re talking to , huh ? !
you think you &apos;re talking to one of your dopey clients ? !
i &apos;m your brother ! you don &apos;t lie to me !
what do you want to hear , that i took the money ?
fine . i took the money .
what were you thinking about ?
you do something that stupid , you think about mom ?
you think about dad ?
you think about our sisters ?
i know .
you know they &apos;re gonna come knocking at mom &apos;s door ?
calling her in the middle of the night asking for statements ?
i know , okay ? i made a mistake .
is that what you &apos;ve been waiting for ?
what , you think i get a kick out of this ?
i enjoy this ?
i think that you like to be the guy that everybody thinks
does everything right , but we both know that you made mistakes .
why ? why ?
that &apos;s all i want to know . why ?
i lost $ 58 million in one day .
and i had to cover it .
so i took some money from my other clients &apos; accounts .
i fixed statements .
i was hoping that if i could cover my tracks ,
that no one would be the wiser ,
and then one lie led to another
and then the next one and the next .
why didn &apos;t you come to me ?
you &apos;re a cop .
i knew that you would ...
i &apos;m your brother . i would have helped you .
i thought about turning myself in ,
then i just couldn &apos;t .
why &apos;d you come to hawaii ?
to cut another deal ,
and try to buy my way out ,
but , uh ... it fell through .
okay .
okay , here &apos;s what ...
okay , we &apos;re getting on a plane together
and we &apos;re going back to new york , okay ?
you &apos;re gonna talk to the fbi ,
you &apos;re gonna talk to the sec
and you &apos;re going to cop to everything ,
you understand ?
i &apos;ll go to jail .
yeah , you &apos;re probably gonna go to jail .
minimum @-@ security .
all right , we &apos;re gonna get you a good lawyer .
all right , i &apos;m personally gonna talk
to the district attorney , and i &apos;m gonna be there with you
and we &apos;re gonna get through this together .
this is gonna kill mom and dad .
okay , listen to me .
um , we got a long road ahead .
we &apos;re going back home . i want you to pack a bag .
i &apos;ll be back in a couple of hours .
i cross @-@ checked red suv rentals with cases
that involved both kamalei and chen , and i got a hit .
travis roan , age 49 , current resident of cheyenne , wyoming .
no local address .
and he used to work on a demo team .
so he knows his way around a construction site .
and he spent seven years
in the wyoming state pen for aggravated assault .
okay , but wyoming ? i don &apos;t understand .
was he tried here ?
no , but his son was .
thomas roan .
yeah . 20 years old .
got 18 months for a dui ,
then got stabbed in a mess hall fight .
died in prison ten days ago .
oh , man .
and kamalei and chen put him there , right ?
this guy &apos;s looking for payback for his dead son .
so i pulled thomas &apos; case and i spoke to the judge
trying to figure out our last potential target .
maybe an arresting officer , a key witness .
but all judge kamalei can remember about the case
was the flood of appeals that came after his verdict .
who filed the appeals ?
thomas &apos; mom .
court paperwork shows a local address for her .
maybe she can help us find travis roan .
i can &apos;t believe it .
oh , my god , those poor children .
do you know where travis is right now ?
back in wyoming , i thought .
he was only in town for thomas &apos; funeral .
we &apos;re very sorry to hear about what happened to your son .
thomas couldn &apos;t wait to leave cheyenne .
said this place was like paradise .
then first semester , he got pulled over for a dui .
the judge and that prosecutor had to make an example of him .
what do you mean by that ?
it was the third dui that week
right in the heart of waikiki .
it didn &apos;t help that thomas was underage and hit a fancy car .
so instead of probation or getting his license revoked ...
he got 18 months .
i tried to appeal ,
moved down here to do so .
how did your ex @-@ husband take that ?
hard . they wouldn &apos;t even let him visit his son .
former felons aren &apos;t allowed .
thomas was only 13 when his father went away to rawlins .
they wrote letters and such , but they hadn &apos;t seen
each other since .
ma &apos;am , did travis ever ...
did he ever make any threats or maybe mention anybody else
that he blamed for thomas &apos; death ?
no .
no , the only thing he kept saying at the funeral was
he never got to say good @-@ bye .
mrs. roan , this is very important .
we need to know where travis was staying .
we &apos;re clear .
he was just here .
the sink &apos;s still wet , looks like he shaved .
i got a photo and letters from thomas to his dad .
chin , i got the kits .
the last remote is gone .
we &apos;re running out of time .
hold on , i got something here . these letters ...
roan &apos;s blaming someone named &quot; meachum . &quot;
says , &quot; she sold me out .
she convinced me to take the deal . &quot;
that &apos;s his lawyer .
public defender .
right .
our next target .
pi &apos;ikoi middle school ?
yeah , i &apos;m , like , two minutes away from there . why ?
because that &apos;s where our suspect is headed .
he &apos;s after brian meachum , the public defender &apos;s kid .
all right . you got an id on this guy ?
yeah , the guy &apos;s name is travis roan .
he &apos;s driving a red suv , it &apos;s a rental .
i &apos;m sending you a picture right now .
danny , listen to me , okay ?
get a visual on this guy , and then proceed
with extreme caution . he is highly unstable ,
and he &apos;s carrying explosives .
looking for this , mr. meachum ?
yeah .
found it by the gym .
somebody must be messing with you .
thanks .
you be careful , now .
your homework .
always remember to double @-@ check it .
right . thanks again .
kono , any luck reaching diana meachum ?
no , straight to voice mail .
but dmv database shows she &apos;s driving a beige minivan ,
license plate : charlie , bravo ,
zero , three , two , five .
okay , got it . listen , remember that transmitter
is only good for a thousand feet , okay ?
you locate the meachums ,
roan can &apos;t be far away , so be careful .
why do you always set your phone on vibrate ?
it &apos;s a little embarrassing when it goes off in court .
maybe you should answer it .
this is diana .
mrs. meachum .
this is lieutenant commander steve mcgarrett from five @-@ o.
you &apos;re in danger right now .
you need to get out of your car ,
and move away , right away .
brian , get out of the car right now .
don &apos;t touch anything .
get out . just go . go .
get the meachums .
steve , over here .
five @-@ o , hands where i can see them .
hey . i need you to step out of the car slowly , all right ?
that boy ...
he &apos;s only 13 years old .
just like thomas was when i last saw him .
just like thomas .
now he &apos;s gone .
he &apos;s gone .
i lost him .
i lost him .
i lost him .
get out of the car , out , out , out , out . now .
get down on the ground .
hands behind your back .
i gotta go pick up my brother .
he was going to run .
can you believe that ?
charter company got back to me with the flight manifest ,
and he used our third @-@ grade gym teacher &apos;s name
to book the flight .
he was going to skip out first thing in the morning .
sorry , man .
yeah , me , too .
let me give you guys a ride to the airport .
nah , you don &apos;t have to do that .
come on . come on , we &apos;ll talk in the truck .
he &apos;s not here .
where the hell did he go ?
five @-@ o !
hey , hey , hey ! stand down . stand down .
where the hell is he ? hmm ? what &apos;d you say to him ?
what &apos;s going on ?
what are you talking about ?
well , we lost the tail on your brother .
phone &apos;s dead , he switched cars , and when we got
to the meet , there was no one there .
he tipped them off before the deal ever went down .
stop . stop , okay ? i have no idea
what you &apos;re saying to me right now . you understand ?
what meet ? what deal ? what are you talking about ?
come here .
the footage is courtesy of the dea .
guy in the black shirt is pedro fuentes ,
accountant for the third most powerful cartel in columbia .
and your brother ... is making a deal
to launder his drug money .
how much can you handle ?
ten ?
ten million should be fine .
once i get it in and out of singapore .
and the meet was supposed to go down today .
you had no idea ?
we had it all set up .
we were gonna take them all down as soon as we saw the money .
yeah , except sometime today , your brother changed the plan .
and now they &apos;ve all gone under .
if you have any idea where your brother is ,
you need to tell us right now , detective .
i have no clue .
you understand me ?
what ?
you gotta tell him .
you ... you gotta tell him .
i gotta tell him what ?
tell him what you told me .
his brother &apos;s got plans to leave the island .
mcgarrett , you know where williams is ?
yeah , i do . he &apos;s got a boat
near kawela bay , on the north shore , okay ?
