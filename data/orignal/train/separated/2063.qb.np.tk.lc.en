prison ruined clifford &apos;s life .
and if you had been our lawyer ,
he never would have been convicted in the first place .
what do you want ?
you do two years in prison ,
and i won &apos;t go after any of your friends .
it &apos;s the only sure way to put this to bed
and make sure that the only person
who is hurt by it is me .
what about me ?
all i did was love you .
i &apos;m not gonna rat them out .
i &apos;m not asking you to .
i &apos;m just asking you to have faith in yourself .
don &apos;t fall on your sword again .
we might not win .
you don &apos;t always have to be the hero .
i &apos;m not doing it to be the hero .
then why the hell are you doing it ?
i would never send my friends to prison .
they find me guilty ,
they &apos;re gonna send my friends to prison anyways .
the jury came back . we have an hour .
where &apos;s mike ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m ready to take your deal .
which one ?
so just to be clear ,
this is the one you want to go with .
you go to prison for two years , your friends go free ,
and no crying about it once it &apos;s done .
one stipulation .
i &apos;m not reducing your jail time by one minute .
that &apos;s not it .
i want you to write in that once we sign ,
you can &apos;t renegotiate with harvey .
oh , i get it .
you &apos;re afraid i &apos;m gonna use this
to get him to take the bullet for you .
i &apos;m not afraid of you trying to do that ,
because i know you will .
so , either put it in , or we go to verdict .
and just remember , like you said to me ,
tick tock .
what did you do ?
i did what i had to do .
i pled guilty .
bullshit .
you didn &apos;t plead anything .
harvey , look at me .
it was my crime .
it was my choice to make ,
and i made it .
it &apos;s done .
well , i &apos;m gonna unmake it ,
because the judge hasn &apos;t ratified it yet ,
and until she does , nothing is done .
harvey , stop .
no , you listen to me .
if you think i &apos;m gonna let you do this ,
you &apos;re out of your goddamn mind .
do what , mike ?
what did you do ?
i took the two years .
no , no , you didn &apos;t .
rachel , rachel , please .
i don &apos;t accept that .
please listen .
it was the only way that i could--
no , it wasn &apos;t the only way .
you told me that you &apos;d wait for the verdict ,
and i begged you to have faith in yourself ,
and you told me that you would .
that was before i begged diaz to take a deal
that would rat out his friend ,
and he didn &apos;t listen to me--
wait a second . you &apos;re throwing away
the next two years of our lives
for something that some criminal said ?
just stop . listen to me .
hold on .
harvey said he wasn &apos;t gonna let this happen .
he went to see the judge , didn &apos;t he ?
it doesn &apos;t matter . he can &apos;t stop it .
why not ?
because it &apos;s not up to him .
it &apos;s up to me , and i &apos;ve made my decision .
rachel , where are you going ?
anywhere else .
because if you &apos;re gonna rob us
of the next two years of our lives ,
i am not gonna stand here and watch you do it .
ms. gibbs , i don &apos;t appreciate being kept waiting
once the jury has informed us they &apos;ve reached a verdict .
i &apos;m sorry , your honor .
mr. ross and i were finalizing a plea agreement .
i &apos;m sorry too , your honor ,
but they haven &apos;t finalized shit .
what did you just say in my courtroom ?
you heard what i said .
my chambers , right now .
rachel , i heard the jury is back .
i came down to hear the verdict .
there &apos;s not gonna be a verdict ,
so you can turn right around ,
because mike took a deal to spend two years in prison .
oh , my god .
and they &apos;re in there right now
signing off on it .
and i don &apos;t know what to do .
okay , i &apos;ll tell you what you need to do .
you need to go back inside ,
and you need to be there for him .
i &apos;m not gonna go back inside and be there for him .
why not ?
because he told me that he wasn &apos;t going to do this .
he told me that it was on the table ,
and i begged him not to take it ,
and he promised me that he wouldn &apos;t .
rachel , last night harvey came to me
wanting to do the same thing ,
and i begged him to have faith in that jury .
and harvey kept his word .
but he might not have ,
and i told myself that if he changed his mind ,
i would have to forgive him .
then donna , you &apos;re a better woman than i am ,
because mike is my heart ,
and right now i feel like someone is ripping my heart
out of my chest , and that someone--
that someone &apos;s him .
your honor , i don &apos;t give a shit about that deal .
she took advantage of my client .
she coerced him , and you have the power to stop it .
i &apos;ve had enough of your language , mr. specter .
it wasn &apos;t coercion .
it was negotiated by a competent attorney .
it &apos;s rock solid , and there &apos;s no basis to stop it .
he &apos;s not a competent attorney .
he &apos;s cutting a deal to plead guilty to fraud .
you want to cut a different deal with me ? i &apos;m all ears .
yeah , the only problem with that
is you can &apos;t sign a different deal ,
because you already signed your rights to that away .
god damn it , mike , don &apos;t do this .
we can go to verdict .
don &apos;t give me that .
you weren &apos;t racing over to her office
to tell her that the jury was back .
you were going to jump on the grenade ,
and i beat you to it .
now i told you it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s done .
are you absolutely sure , mr. ross ?
i am , your honor .
then , mr. ross , you have 72 hours
to report to danbury federal prison .
第五季 第十六集
give it to me straight .
what happened ?
mike pled guilty , and in exchange ,
they can &apos;t go after you , harvey , louis , or any of us .
shit .
for someone who just found out
she &apos;s not going to prison , you don &apos;t seem happy .
i was never worried about going to prison , donna .
what are you worried about ?
losing my firm .
now that mike pled guilty , every case he ever touched
has &quot; lawsuit &quot; written all over it .
so what are we gonna do ?
i &apos;ll tell you what we &apos;re going to do .
we &apos;re gonna restructure this firm ,
and we &apos;re gonna do it before the lawsuits even start .
get me louis .
michael .
gloria , what are you doing here ?
i came here to be with you for the verdict ,
but they told me you made a deal .
i did .
michael , there &apos;s no way the lord would have
put me through two innocent men going away .
but mrs. danner , i &apos;m not innocent ,
and i did what they accused me of .
i &apos;m not stupid , michael .
i didn &apos;t mean you went to law school .
i meant you are innocent in your heart ,
and now you &apos;ve chosen to go to a place
filled with men who aren &apos;t .
i don &apos;t think you understand .
i &apos;m going to a white @-@ collar prison .
there &apos;s no such thing as a white @-@ collar prison
once they close those doors .
you need to hear me .
gloria , look , i know that you are trying to help ,
but i took responsibility for what i did ,
and i &apos;m gonna live with it .
but right now , i need to go spend time with the woman i love
and make things right ,
so i &apos;m sorry , but you have to excuse me .
robert , i got your message .
i rushed right over .
what happened to rachel ?
i &apos;ll tell you what happened .
mike ross is going to jail ,
my daughter is heartbroken ,
and harvey and jessica are getting off scot @-@ free .
wait a second . if you lured me down here
because you wanted a punching bag ,
i can tell you right now , that &apos;s not gonna happen .
well , let me tell you what is gonna happen .
it &apos;s about to be open season on every case
that mike ross ever put his good @-@ for @-@ nothing name on ,
and once that happens ,
it &apos;s just a matter of time
until every one of your attorneys tries to leave .
i see what this is .
you want to use me to start an avalanche
that will bury harvey and jessica .
guess what ?
i &apos;m not gonna do it .
then you &apos;re a bigger fool than i thought ,
because i &apos;m gonna find someone that will .
good luck with that , because we have a noncompete .
not anymore , you don &apos;t .
bullshit . you &apos;re bluffing .
then why don &apos;t you go and ask your ex @-@ associate katrina ?
because she &apos;s the one that gave me
the way around it in the first place .
harvey , i heard about mike .
i am so sorry .
well , you can stop being sorry
and get me the name of that jury foreman .
harvey , you can &apos;t get a mistrial .
it &apos;s too late . mike cut a deal .
i don &apos;t need legal advice , donna .
i need the name and address of that foreman .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
it &apos;s not breaking the law anymore , donna .
it &apos;s just a favor .
i &apos;m not gonna ruin his life .
i just need to ask him a goddamn question .
well , i &apos;m not gonna do that until you tell me
what that question is .
donna ...
mike just threw his whole life away ,
and there &apos;s nothing i can do about it ,
and the only way that i can accept it
is if i find out what that verdict was gonna be .
i &apos;ll get you the name .
robert zane just told me
he can take away our noncompete .
i need you to tell me right now how he &apos;s gonna do that .
nice to see you too , louis .
can i offer you a prunie ?
no , i don &apos;t need a damn prunie .
i need you to tell me what he &apos;s up to .
louis , i &apos;m here now ,
and the reason i &apos;m here
is that i got fired for helping you ,
and even though you promised to bring me back
once you were named partner ,
you didn &apos;t .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
i wanted to bring you back , katrina , more than anything .
don &apos;t give me that , louis .
i covered for you after sheila dumped you .
i helped you poach versalife .
i even forged government documents for you .
okay , katrina , i wanted to bring you back ,
i couldn &apos;t protect you--
from what ?
from finding out mike ross is a fraud ?
yeah , i did the math , louis ,
and you couldn &apos;t have protected me from it ,
but you could use it to get your name on the door ,
couldn &apos;t you ?
are you gonna look me in the eye and tell me that isn &apos;t true ?
it &apos;s true .
well , i appreciate your honesty .
since you were honest with me , i &apos;ll be honest with you .
i can &apos;t help you .
are you okay ?
no .
rachel ...
i just don &apos;t understand , mike .
you told me you &apos;d wait for the verdict .
i know .
rachel , listen to me , all right ?
i didn &apos;t do this to hurt you .
i did it because it &apos;s who i am .
i know that .
then why are you holding it against me ?
because i can &apos;t stand the thought of losing you .
you &apos;re not gonna lose me .
yes , i am , mike , for two years .
and it could have been seven .
it could have been zero .
they took--
why couldn &apos;t you just wait for the verdict ?
because i have to live with myself
for the rest of my life .
i made a decision , and i ...
i can &apos;t go back in time and change it .
but we are here right now , all right ?
we have--we have three days left .
i &apos;m gonna have to take one of those days for myself ...
because you promised me that you would have faith in yourself .
and you didn &apos;t .
you remember me ?
how could i not ?
i listened to you for the better part of two weeks .
then i &apos;ll get right to it .
i need a favor .
you got a truck needs fixing ?
i want to know what that verdict was gonna be .
no , you don &apos;t .
yeah , i do .
what difference does it make ?
it makes all the difference in the world .
then i &apos;ll tell you ,
&apos;cause i &apos;ve been dying to tell somebody ,
&apos;cause it was &quot; 12 angry men &quot; in there ,
and i was the one .
yeah , that &apos;s right .
one by one , i put that jury on my back
and we did the right thing .
what &apos;s the right thing ?
you think i don &apos;t know what &apos;s what ?
that kid didn &apos;t go to law school .
you know it , i know it ,
everybody in the goddamn room knew it .
it was guilty .
i didn &apos;t say that .
that woman didn &apos;t make her case ,
and i &apos;m not letting my country &apos;s justice system
go to shit on my watch .
say it .
not guilty .
they told us you guys cut some kind of deal .
guess you should have had a little more faith in the system .
mr. specter ?
mr. specter .
mrs. danner , what can i do for you ?
i tried to talk to michael , but he wouldn &apos;t listen .
talk to him about what ?
about what &apos;s gonna happen to him inside that prison .
mrs. danner , i appreciate you coming down here ,
but i can &apos;t talk about this right now .
i don &apos;t care .
you &apos;re gonna listen to what i have to say ,
because i saw what prison did to my son , mr. specter .
michael needs to know
what his first day is gonna be like ,
who to make friends with ,
what guards to stay away from ,
because it &apos;s the guards that are the worst .
you think i don &apos;t know all that ?
then do something to toughen up that boy .
i told you , i can &apos;t talk about this right now .
go ahead .
walk away .
but you owe me .
because you may have gotten him out ,
but you &apos;re also the one who put him in that hellhole
in the first place .
louis , where the hell have you been ?
we have a problem .
you think i don &apos;t know that ?
i need you to bifurcate the firm
into two entities , and i need you to do it now .
i know what you &apos;re thinking .
if we insulate our clients , we can hold on to our lawyers ,
but that won &apos;t help .
why the hell not ?
because robert zane has a way to
bust our noncompete .
god damn it .
he finds somebody to jump ship ,
it &apos;ll be a stampede for the exits .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to tell you .
all right , then forget about splitting the firm
and work on figuring out what the hell he &apos;s up to ,
or there won &apos;t be a firm left to split .
i need to talk to you .
i can &apos;t , mike , not now .
harvey , i need to know if you think
i did the right thing taking that plea .
god damn it , you ask me that now ?
rachel can &apos;t get past the fact
that i didn &apos;t wait for the verdict to come in .
it &apos;s tearing her up , and that &apos;s tearing me up .
mike--
harvey , i know that you are pissed
that i made a deal before you ,
but i need you to tell me that i made the right call .
you did .
how can you be sure ?
because i went to see the foreman ,
and he told me the verdict was guilty .
what ?
look , the idea of you going to prison was killing me ,
and i couldn &apos;t let it go unless i knew .
but now you can .
i still wish you would have let me take the hit instead of you ,
but yeah , i can .
go home , mike .
get whatever time left you have with rachel .
it &apos;s gonna be easier now .
i never thought the word &quot; guilty &quot; would do that .
are you all right ?
i &apos;m fine .
can i get you anything ?
yeah .
clear your schedule for the rest of the day .
i need you to get me everything there is to get from mike &apos;s trial .
harvey , i don &apos;t understand .
you said if you talked to that foreman ,
you would be able to make peace with this .
i don &apos;t care what i said .
and he said that mike was guilty ,
and mike accepted those consequences .
he didn &apos;t say mike was guilty .
he said he was goddamn innocent .
oh , my god .
he &apos;s going away for nothing .
no , donna , he &apos;s not going away at all .
what do you need me to do ?
i need you to get me
everything we have on that trial ,
because i &apos;m gonna figure out a way
to invalidate that goddamn deal .
jessica , do you have a minute ?
i &apos;m really busy right now , jack .
i &apos;m afraid this can &apos;t wait .
i &apos;m officially giving you my letter of resignation .
let me guess .
robert zane made you an offer .
he did ,
and as much as i didn &apos;t want to take it ,
i have to .
oh , you have to ?
you begged me for a second chance
and a third and a fourth ,
and i gave them all to you ,
and now he &apos;s using you to destroy us .
we &apos;re already destroyed .
you just don &apos;t want to accept it .
no , this is a setback .
i &apos;m sorry .
jack .
i think you &apos;re forgetting about that folder you gave me ,
the one with the little legal indiscretion
daniel hardman had on you .
let &apos;s not soft @-@ pedal it , jessica .
it wasn &apos;t an indiscretion . it was a flat @-@ out crime .
and the problem with you using it is ,
you &apos;ll be announcing to the world
yet another crime happened under your watch ,
and you did nothing to stop it .
and whatever clients were willing to stay with you before
won &apos;t be willing to anymore .
i think i &apos;m gonna miss this the most .
miss what ?
coming home to you .
rachel , i know i should have told you what i was gonna do
before i made that deal ,
but i didn &apos;t know i was gonna do it ,
and i had , like , three seconds to make a decision .
and those three seconds took away two whole years .
actually , gave us back five .
what are you talking about ?
harvey found the jury foreman .
they were gonna find me guilty .
and we only had three days , and i took away one of them .
hey , it &apos;s okay .
rachel , i don &apos;t care .
as long as we &apos;re good .
i don &apos;t want us to just be good .
i want us to be one .
i want to be your wife before you go .
i want to be your husband .
okay , i got us some coffees and--
donna , what the hell ? this isn &apos;t everything .
what do you mean , this isn &apos;t everything ?
i mean , she had to have filed motions
and subpoenas and discovery ,
and all this shit is nothing .
harvey , these boxes are--
what ?
this is his class ranking that he wasn &apos;t on .
this is his transcript .
this is his yearbook .
where are the things that we can attack procedurally ?
they &apos;re over there .
then why haven &apos;t you gone through them ?
because that &apos;s not what i do .
then what in god &apos;s name are you doing in here ?
i &apos;m supporting you , harvey , and right now ,
i &apos;m gonna do that by giving you some space .
if you think you can waltz into my firm
and take my lawyers ,
you must be out of your damn mind .
let me guess , you &apos;re suing me for inducement .
you bet your ass i am .
you induced jack soloff into breaking his noncompete .
you don &apos;t have a noncompete with jack soloff or anyone else .
i heard you tried that empty threat with louis ,
but it &apos;s not gonna work with me .
if it is empty ,
then so is your morals clause and your bylaws ,
which states that if a named partner
participates in a crime , any partner is free to go .
and conspiracy to commit fraud is a goddamn crime .
you can &apos;t prove we knew about mike ross .
well , let me suggest that you ask louis litt
about his conversation with katrina bennett this morning .
i got you , jessica ,
and if you want to come after me
for hiring jack , or anyone for hiring anyone ,
you may not go to jail ,
but the world is gonna know what you did .
why are you doing this , robert ?
i don &apos;t give a shit about you hiring a fraud , jessica ,
but you never came to me with it
once he started dating rachel .
how could i have known i could have trusted you
not to come after my firm ?
that picture on robert &apos;s desk
is how you could have known , jessica .
now if you &apos;ll excuse us , we have tickets for the theater .
sorry about before , donna .
it &apos;s okay , harvey . i understand .
and i &apos;ve been thinking we &apos;re going about this all wrong .
what do you mean ?
i mean appealing something based on legal minutiae
isn &apos;t what you do .
and what exactly is it that i do ?
you get people to do things they don &apos;t want to
by giving them something else .
donna , i can &apos;t do that with gibbs ,
because what she really wants is me ,
and mike won &apos;t let me .
and what if you give her something bigger ?
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about liberty rail .
no .
harvey , if we &apos;re willing to let me be prosecuted
for what i did , then you can give gibbs
people who committed murder and get mike off the hook .
two for one .
donna , i am not trading you for mike .
period .
then what are we gonna do ?
we &apos;re gonna give gibbs her murderers
without giving you up at all .
louis , tell me right now .
did you admit to katrina bennett
that you knew about mike ross ?
the morals clause .
god damn it .
jessica , she already knew .
her knowing and you flat @-@ out confessing
aren &apos;t the same thing .
it doesn &apos;t matter . she can &apos;t prove it .
louis , don &apos;t you get it ?
katrina bennett was your protégé .
all that underhanded shit that you do ,
she learned all of it .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying that she recorded you ,
and if that tape ever sees the light of day ,
any partner who wants can walk out that door
and take their clients with them .
no , they can &apos;t .
where are you going ?
to the file room .
you &apos;re right , jessica .
katrina was my protégé ,
and she knows all my dirty laundry ,
but i also know hers .
let me take care of it .
i don &apos;t think so .
after the way we ended things last time ,
it &apos;s the least i can do .
what do you want , harvey ?
i want liberty rail .
well , that &apos;s never gonna happen ,
and you need to let that shit go .
what i need is to trade that shit for mike ross &apos;s freedom .
what the hell are you talking about ?
you give me liberty rail ,
i &apos;ll give you five of my best clients .
there &apos;s no way jessica pearson allows that to happen .
it &apos;s not her call .
they &apos;re my clients .
well , i don &apos;t care ,
because i &apos;m not breaking privilege
and risking my entire career in exchange for five clients .
what &apos;s it gonna take ?
you want my price ?
i want to go shopping at pearson specter litt .
exclusive access to hire anyone i want ,
from paralegals to senior partners and their clients ,
for the next month .
you &apos;d be gutting the firm .
do i look like i care ?
there is no way jessica accepts this ,
and you know it .
what i know is , people will do anything
if they &apos;re desperate enough .
and if you &apos;re in here doing this ,
then you &apos;re desperate to save mike ross .
michael , if you &apos;re here to see robert ,
he &apos;s already gone .
i &apos;m not here to see robert .
i &apos;m here to see you .
well , i &apos;d rather you go .
laura , please .
please what , michael ?
robert and i were ready to embrace
the man who was going to marry our daughter ,
and it turns out , that man is a liar .
and now you &apos;re here to get me to convince my husband
to go to your wedding ?
it &apos;s not just my wedding .
it &apos;s also rachel &apos;s .
and i can talk to robert until i &apos;m blue in the face .
he will never forgive you .
he doesn &apos;t need to forgive me , all right ?
he just needs to be there for his daughter .
he &apos;s not gonna do that .
why not ?
because you &apos;re ruining her life .
look , laura , i know that i made a horrible mistake .
i &apos;m going away for two years ,
when i could have gotten out of it by turning in my friends .
rachel knows that &apos;s the kind of man that i am .
that &apos;s why she wants to spend the rest of her life with me .
now all @-@ all i am asking you is that you help robert see that .
i know my husband .
what you &apos;re asking is impossible ,
and i don &apos;t expect you to understand that ,
because you &apos;ve never been the father of a daughter .
but i &apos;ll try .
i don &apos;t understand .
of course you don &apos;t ,
because you &apos;ve also never been the mother of a daughter .
louis .
what are you doing here ?
why &apos;d you do it ?
do what ?
don &apos;t be coy with me , katrina .
it &apos;s one thing to share our bylaws ,
but i know you recorded me , and i want to know why .
i did it because it put my name on the map with robert zane .
if you don &apos;t destroy that recording ,
it &apos;s gonna put your name on the map somewhere else .
this is a copy of the document i forged for you .
yeah , the one you reminded me of yesterday ,
the same one that i &apos;m gonna give to the sec
if you don &apos;t back off .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
you can still come work with us .
no , i can &apos;t , and even if i wanted to ,
i can &apos;t trust you anymore .
that &apos;s not fair .
if it wasn &apos;t me , it would &apos;ve been somebody else .
but it was you , katrina .
my own protégé stabbing me in the back ?
i was just trying to make a name for myself .
and i just wanted my name on the wall ,
but let me tell you something .
if there &apos;s one thing that i have learned ,
it &apos;s not worth being willing to do anything
to make a name for yourself .
jessica , i need to talk to you .
harvey , before you ask whatever you &apos;re about to ask ,
i &apos;m not in the mood .
well , that &apos;s not gonna cut it .
i need you to waive our noncompetes for evan smith .
is this a joke ?
it &apos;s the only way to keep mike out of prison .
there is no way to keep mike out of prison .
yes , there is .
we give evan people who already want to go ,
and i give anita gibbs murderers in exchange for mike .
and i &apos;ve just spent the last 24 hours
fighting to keep our noncompetes .
jessica .
no .
he cut a deal to save this firm .
he cut a deal to keep us from going to prison ,
and you know it .
you know , i don &apos;t give a shit
what he thought when he made that deal .
he was gonna be found innocent .
what ?
i went to see the foreman .
the verdict was gonna be not guilty .
then let me see your deal with gibbs .
i don &apos;t have it yet .
are you crazy ?
you &apos;re asking me to decimate my firm
for a deal you don &apos;t even know she &apos;ll take ?
i &apos;ll make her take the deal .
you don &apos;t know that .
yes , i do .
jessica , we have a chance to save mike
and let the people who want to go , go .
and what if it doesn &apos;t work and we lose everything ?
then we do .
jessica , harvey &apos;s right .
mike &apos;s family .
even if we lose half the firm , if we don &apos;t try to save him ,
who are we ?
make the deal .
da ..
where is he ?
he &apos;s not here .
well , that &apos;s too bad
because i came here to talk to him ,
even though he didn &apos;t have the balls to talk to me .
he wasn &apos;t afraid to talk to you .
he went to mom because i asked him to .
oh , okay .
okay , let &apos;s down to this .
you marry him , and that man ruins your life .
how , dad ?
we &apos;re gonna get through the next two years and then--
and then what ?
because you &apos;re sure as shit not gonna be a lawyer .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about you graduating ,
and then you &apos;re gonna stand before
the character and fitness committee of the bar .
and the last time i checked ,
marrying a man that defrauded them
isn &apos;t gonna get you in .
okay , and by the time that happens ,
he will have served his time , and we will have paid his debt .
what the hell difference does that make ?
the difference is
that &apos;s what our justice system is all about ,
and standing behind the man that you love
is the definition of character and fitness .
okay , you tell them that ,
and they &apos;re gonna tell you and your felon husband
to go to hell .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
oh , yes it is , god damn it !
these are vindictive and protective people ,
and he make them look like fools .
this isn &apos;t about me not becoming a lawyer
or him ruining my life
or any of this other bullshit that you &apos;re in here saying .
this is because he pulled one over on you .
he can &apos;t be trusted !
dad , i &apos;m sorry that i kept this from you ,
but he didn &apos;t keep it from me ,
and i &apos;m telling you i can trust him .
and how can i trust you ?
well , if you can &apos;t ,
then maybe you shouldn &apos;t come to the wedding .
well , that about sums it up .
i &apos;m proud of you , michael .
it &apos;s not easy to resist the temptation
to make a deal that saves yourself .
well , as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
i did make a deal that saves myself .
but i didn &apos;t just come here to make you proud .
i came to ask a favor .
name it .
rachel and i want to get married before i go .
i know it &apos;s not supposed to happen
for another couple of months but--
you don &apos;t have that kind of time .
look , i promise it &apos;s not gonna be too much trouble .
we &apos;re not gonna invite too many people .
i &apos;d be honored , michael .
thank you , father .
michael , since you &apos;re not inviting many people ,
we don &apos;t have to do it in here .
we could always do it in the small chapel .
i appreciate that , father ,
but my mom and dad weren &apos;t married in the small chapel .
okay , you &apos;re here .
what &apos;s so important i had to
reschedule an arraignment to meet with you ?
because that arraignment wasn &apos;t gonna lead to you
putting corporate murderers behind bars .
let me guess .
you got a hold of some incriminating documents ,
and you want me to prosecute these people
in exchange for keeping mike ross out of jail .
murder for fraud , straight up .
not interested .
listen to me .
compared to this , what mike ross did
barely constitutes spitting on a sidewalk .
i know that .
then what the hell is wrong with you ?
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s wrong with me .
you .
you &apos;ve been bending the rules
since the day you were born ,
and i &apos;m not letting you get away with it anymore .
are you kidding me ?
you bent rules up and down this entire case .
except the difference between you and me is ,
i &apos;m bending them to get justice .
putting these people away is justice .
then give them to me anyway .
that &apos;s right .
you &apos;ve been keeping this case in your back pocket
waiting for a rainy day ,
because that &apos;s what you do .
so maybe the next time you have a chance
to put away murderers , you &apos;ll do it
instead of saving it up for a chit down the road .
you hate me that much ?
i don &apos;t hate you , but you did this ,
and you can try to get out of it ,
but what you can &apos;t do anymore is deny you did it .
i &apos;m not trying to get out of this .
i &apos;d take the punishment for him .
you had plenty of chances to do that ,
but you waited until it was too late .
now , you want to keep mike out of prison ?
you have to convince him to let you take his place .
what are you doing here ?
harvey , i want to talk to you .
good , because i want to talk to you .
i want you to be my best man .
what ?
rachel and i want to get married .
you &apos;re less than a day from prison ,
and you &apos;re thinking about dresses and flowers ?
harvey--
you know what ?
i &apos;ll be your best man on one condition .
that ship has sailed .
the hell it has .
we can still call gibbs .
i am not calling gibbs .
get it through your head .
this is on me .
no , you get it through your head .
i am not letting you go to prison
for a crime that i committed .
well , i &apos;m not letting you go
when you were gonna be found innocent .
what did you say ?
that &apos;s right , i lied .
the verdict was not guilty .
no , i don &apos;t believe you .
then call the goddamn guy .
why the hell would you lie to me ?
because the truth would have broken you .
oh , except now you want to break me ?
because it &apos;s the only way you &apos;re gonna let me do this .
you think putting a ring on rachel &apos;s finger
is gonna make everything go away ?
you know what , harvey ?
you want to come to my wedding , you let me know .
you want to go to prison ?
rule number one : never turn your back on anyone .
i know what you &apos;re doing , and it &apos;s not gonna work .
i &apos;m not trying to take your place anymore .
i &apos;m trying to get you ready
like gloria danner asked me to .
harvey--
because you &apos;re weak .
i am not weak .
yeah , well , hit me .
no .
hit me .
harvey , stop it .
listen .
no , you listen to me .
you think you &apos;re not weak ?
you &apos;re only doing this
because you feel guilty , all right ?
louis litt
got you in a headlock .
but i am not gonna
hit you just because ...
tess &apos;s husband kicked your ass .
you can &apos;t handle the fact--
logan sanders hooked up with rachel .
stop right now .
what do you think he &apos;s gonna
do with her the second you get ...
is that what you want ? that i hate you ,
and that you made me do this ?
i &apos;m gonna lose everything because of you !
mike , please .
let &apos;s call gibbs .
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t , harvey .
i can &apos;t .
what are you doing ?
sometimes i like to come and just watch .
see how far you &apos;ve come ?
oh , something like that .
gibbs didn &apos;t take the deal , jessica .
i &apos;m sorry , i was wrong .
no , louis , you were right .
he &apos;s family , and we had to try .
and whoever &apos;s left ,
we &apos;ll be stronger ,
even if we &apos;re smaller .
i &apos;m sorry , mike .
i shouldn &apos;t have told you the truth about the verdict .
i probably shouldn &apos;t have hit you all those times .
it &apos;s okay .
makes me feel better knowing you have it in you .
i got to go .
i got to ask rachel to marry me .
i thought you were already getting married .
there &apos;s something i got to tell her first .
you come here to gloat ?
because tonight is not the night .
no , robert .
i came here to make peace .
you were right .
i should have come to you , and i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t ,
and i will regret that for the rest of my life .
but i understand rachel is getting married tomorrow ,
and i &apos;m telling you , if you &apos;re not there for her ,
you will regret it for the rest of yours .
rachel ?
i &apos;m in the bedroom .
don &apos;t come in .
why ? what &apos;s wrong ?
no , nothing &apos;s wrong .
i @-@ i have my dress on .
rachel , come on , please .
there are about a million things with this wedding
that aren &apos;t going as planned ,
and i &apos;m fine with that ,
but i &apos;m not gonna jinx it by having you
see me in my dress .
rachel , i was wrong about the verdict .
harvey lied to me .
they were gonna find me not guilty .
rachel , please open the door .
why are you telling me this right now ?
because you only wanted to get married
after you found out i was guilty ,
and i didn &apos;t want to start our life out
with another secret .
you were right .
i should have had faith in myself ,
and i didn &apos;t .
if you don &apos;t want to do this now ,
i understand .
we can do it when i get out .
in my mind , you are out ,
and no one knows what &apos;s gonna happen
after they get married .
they just know what &apos;s gonna happen
the day that they do .
and the day we &apos;re getting married is tomorrow .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever seen a more beautiful bride .
that &apos;s good , because i have never seen
a more beautiful maid of honor .
so i don &apos;t want to bother you ,
but i just wanted to come in and give you a little bit
of an early wedding present .
donna , you don &apos;t have to do that .
your mom and dad are here .
thank you .
oh , don &apos;t thank me . thank jessica .
um ... i &apos;m gonna go and put my necklace on
before i make my mascara run .
okay , i &apos;ll just be outside .
no , no , please , i would , um ...
i &apos;d rather you stay .
okay .
donna , can i talk to rachel for a second ?
mike , you can &apos;t .
you can &apos;t see her before the ceremony .
donna , please .
okay , donna , can you just help me put--
mike , you can &apos;t see me in my dress .
rachel , we can &apos;t do this .
what ?
i just walked in and i saw your parents .
they &apos;re here because they have to be ,
not because they want to be .
mike--
it wasn &apos;t just the look on your father &apos;s face .
it &apos;s the look on your mother &apos;s .
they think i &apos;m taking away your future .
you are my future .
i am not saying that i don &apos;t want to get married .
i &apos;m just saying that if for some reason
i was responsible for taking away your dream ...
that you &apos;d never be able to live with yourself .
you go finish law school , okay ?
and you pass the bar , and you become a lawyer ,
and then ... in two years when i get out ,
if you still want to marry me ...
oh , i will .
of course i will .
how &apos;d you know ?
i knew , and there &apos;s no way
i &apos;m letting you do this alone .
they &apos;re all gone .
it &apos;s not your fault , harvey .
i made my case .
i convinced you to hire me .
i was the one that made the call .
you were .
but it doesn &apos;t matter .
&apos;cause even knowing how it all turned out ...
i &apos;d do it again .
i guess i would too ,
&apos;cause i never thought in a million years
i &apos;d meet someone dumb enough
to be willing to go to prison for me .
i mean , donna always said
you were looking for another you .
i guess you found one .
i guess it &apos;s time to get busy living
and get busy dying .
well , that &apos;s goddamn right .
watch your back in there , mike .
i will .
