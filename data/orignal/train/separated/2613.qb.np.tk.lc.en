no !
we can &apos;t leave him alive .
please go . i &apos;ll finish it .
this is between us .
do it quickly . i &apos;ll be waiting outside .
hey ! what happened to you ?
i went out front , and you were gone .
there were police . is it done ?
yes . he &apos;s dead .
call ellie .
hello ?
hey , it &apos;s me .
it &apos;s about tom . it &apos;s urgent .
i could lose my license for this , go to jail .
you owe me .
why aren &apos;t we at a hospital ? he could die !
he cannot die .
i &apos;m gonna need supplies , proper tools .
steven , hey . it &apos;s me . uh , listen , uh ... your boat .
is it still sitting empty or did you find a buyer ?
he &apos;s lost too much blood .
you &apos;re a fed .
and he is responsible for meera &apos;s death .
you were her c.i. , and you told me
that if i found the man responsible --
i thought you were gonna arrest him .
i will . i just need you to babysit for a little while
until i get some info .
let &apos;s get this straight .
i did not save you because i care .
i saved you because you have intel on berlin .
i want a name .
oh , you bitch .
oh , i don &apos;t know , tom .
from where i &apos;m sitting , you look like the bitch to me .
why you ? have you spied on others ?
is this what you do ?
yes . no . i don &apos;t remember .
i want a name . what bank ?
monarch douglas in warsaw .
it &apos;s where berlin keeps his money .
what about accounts , names of shell companies ?
did you murder jolene parker ?
what do you know about reddington ?
i don &apos;t know .
what do you know about reddington ?
i told you i don &apos;t know !
what do you know about reddington ? !
stop asking me ! i don &apos;t know !
when is this all over , when you are convinced
that i have nothing left to offer , what then ?
i asked you a question . gina zanetakos .
because you know when this is over ,
you &apos;re gonna have to kill me , right ?
how often did you communicate with berlin , his associates ?
tell me about the guests at our wedding .
if you want ellie to look at that infection ,
you &apos;re gonna have to answer my question .
i need a doctor !
i need a name !
what about the adoption ?
we were married .
isn &apos;t that what married people do ?
you know , all this time ,
you never asked me if i ever really loved you .
because i know the answer .
i don &apos;t think you do .
you told me if i gave you berlin that you would let me go .
but i knew the second that you brought me down here
that you had no intention of letting me leave .
so here &apos;s the deal , liz .
you &apos;re gonna do whatever you &apos;re gonna do .
you always have .
just do me one favor .
look me in the eyes when you do it .
your daughter told me your name is milos kirchhoff .
all these years , mr. kirchhoff ,
you &apos;ve believed with the blackest of hearts
that i murdered your daughter .
and yet here she is .
the story was wrong , milos .
please enlighten me .
what were you told and who did the telling ?
it was in &apos; 91 .
the soviet union was falling apart .
a small group of us --
members of the politburo , the military ,
kgb , stasi --
had a plan to push back the progressives ,
to stem the tide .
we were meeting and discussing strategy when a ...
bomb ...
the kursk bombing .
15 men were killed
and with them , our resistance .
rumors began that the americans were involved .
one name emerged .
yours .
you came after my daughter .
you exposed her as a dissident .
she went to jail .
after that , my loyalty was questioned .
i was exiled to the gulag ,
where , one by one ,
her bones were sent to me .
you fled .
you must have had help . who ?
there was a man .
he said he could protect me from ...
from you .
what was his name ?
i never met him . i don &apos;t know .
his people -- they called him &quot; the decembrist . &quot;
please .
that &apos;s all i know .
you killed my friends .
you destroyed my life once . isn &apos;t that enough ?
at some point , i may call , ask for your assistance .
about what ?
the decembrist .
we can &apos;t let him walk out of here .
we agreed when this was over , i &apos;d arrest him .
that was four months ago .
if you turn him now , you &apos;re gonna go to jail .
we both will .
i am not a murderer .
neither am i.
look , you don &apos;t have to be the one to do it .
there are people .
but he can &apos;t walk out of here alive .
close that door . keep him quiet .
easy ! harbor master .
all right .
i &apos;m gonna need to see some kind of i.d.
put the gun down .
put the gun down !
we ... got a call --
reports that someone &apos;s been trespassing .
yeah . that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
fbi . we &apos;re searching for two fugitives
escaped from cumberland last night .
i cleared the boat ,
but they &apos;re said to be in the area and armed .
my office wasn &apos;t contacted .
bureau would have reached out ,
but homeland &apos;s running point .
go figure . if you do see anything ...
be careful .
yeah , you , too .
dembe . where is he ?
you &apos;re working with berlin ?
i need to talk to you
about a bombing in the soviet union --
kursk , 1991 .
fella won &apos;t talk !
keep pushing him .
i &apos;m telling you !
he &apos;s more scared of talking than he is of dying !
keep pushing .
i &apos;m gonna need lunch !
tuna on rye ! coleslaw if they have it !
what the hell is going on ? !
we &apos;re shaking a few trees .
there &apos;s been a development .
it seems berlin is merely a pawn
who &apos;s been tragically manipulated .
manipulated by who ?
that &apos;s what brimley &apos;s trying to ascertain .
berlin killed meera , he put tom in my life ,
and every time you have a chance to stop him , you let him go .
berlin will be held accountable for his actions
after i acquire the name of the man who set him against me ,
a man they call the decembrist .
if you want to find the one ultimately responsible
for gutting harold cooper and killing meera malik ,
i suggest you help me find him .
the man we &apos;re looking for is known as the decembrist .
his acts are said to have contributed
to the end of communism in eastern europe .
how is he connected to berlin ?
he tried to assassinate him during a meeting in kursk
and faked his daughter &apos;s death .
berlin &apos;s been hunting reddington , hunting us ,
and now reddington wants to help berlin get revenge ?
kursk -- that bombing --
the men who were killed that day
were leaders of the soviet old guard .
you really think we should be helping these two settle scores ?
our goal is to take down berlin .
if that means solving a terrorism case along the way ,
i &apos;m fine with that .
i &apos;ll contact the fsb .
they won &apos;t help .
the bombing was considered an act of patriotism .
that &apos;s why they never pursued it .
pull the russian reports , the crime @-@ lab data .
i want our own analysis .
they have the bomber &apos;s dna ?
yes . the russian crime lab
reported finding epithelial cells
on the lip of a coffee tin found in the debris .
how do you know it was the bomber &apos;s dna ?
didn &apos;t anyone else like coffee ?
uh , the reports i.d. &apos; d the explosive device as semtex --
same explosives a bomber used to down pan am 103
by hiding the explosives --
in a coffee tin . our guy copied that ?
they have a name ?
only a dna profile , which was useless 20 years ago
before they had a database to run it against .
but today ...
you found the decembrist .
kiryl morozov .
20 years ago , he was a low @-@ level kgb operative .
and today ?
one of the most powerful men in russia .
someone there ?
okay .
oh , thank god .
please .
kiryl morozov
is one of putin &apos;s most trusted advisers .
the man runs the finance ministry .
and we have reason to believe he &apos;s responsible
for the 1991 bombing in kursk that left --
12 people dead . in russia .
the fbi investigates crimes
that happen in america or against americans .
reddington won &apos;t give us berlin
until we give him morozov .
at the very least ,
we should go there and question the man .
i &apos;m not sending you to moscow
to interrogate a high @-@ ranking russian official
about an act of terror he may or may not have committed
25 years ago .
if reddington gets to morozov first , god knows --
harold , that &apos;s an order .
that &apos;s it ?
you &apos;re just gonna stand down on this ?
you heard her .
my hands are tied .
but reddington has anonymous sources .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll get that name somehow .
won &apos;t he , agent keen ?
yes , sir . i &apos;m sure he will .
tell me you have a name .
i do , but this can &apos;t come back on the task force .
are we clear ?
hold on . i &apos;ll be right back .
what ? everything okay ?
no , everything &apos;s not okay . we got a situation here .
uh , hey . i &apos;m sorry . i got to go .
lizzy , what &apos;s going on ?
the decembrist --
his real name is kiryl morozov .
something &apos;s wrong .
kiryl morozov .
i got a name .
so it &apos;s done ?
no .
what are you proposing ?
a trip to moscow .
i went out for a smoke , and he was here .
what the hell ? !
homeboy had a gun .
are you out of your mind ? !
it was him or me .
he &apos;s got blood on him .
what did you do ? how are we supposed to --
if he doesn &apos;t answer that ,
someone is gonna come looking for him .
okay . here &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .
we &apos;re gonna let him go .
we &apos;re gonna move tom .
let him go ? he &apos;s gonna talk .
so let him talk .
he says anything , it &apos;s his word against mine .
and he &apos;s an informant .
look , lady . this is obviously official business .
i can look the other way .
you got to kill him . - no ! please ! listen . listen --
look , if you let this guy go , he &apos;s going to the cops .
when he does , we are all going to jail ,
starting with you ,
for torture , kidnapping , wrongful imprisonment --
take your pick , sweetheart .
you got to kill him .
no . i can fix this .
i have a storage unit . we &apos;ll wait till it gets dark .
we &apos;ll keep him here temporarily until we can find ano-- no !
it &apos;s better this way . let him do it .
get off me ! get your hands off me !
tom , no !
tom , stop !
next one goes in your chest !
tom , let him go !
i think maybe you should call mr. kaplan .
kiryl morozov is paranoid and well @-@ protected .
he has no clear weakness for women or drink .
however , like any politician , he does have an unending need
to hide his ill @-@ gotten gains .
the diamonds .
which he buys and sells
through your broker at mercury city tower in moscow .
there was a friendly
and rather convenient diamond heist this morning .
when morozov learns the broker has been hit ,
he &apos;ll insist on a meeting to assess his exposure .
when he does , we &apos;ll be there waiting .
milos , focus .
i &apos;ve made morozov millions ,
and he &apos;s the one who set all this in motion ?
milos , the meeting at mercury tower --
when it happens ,
it &apos;ll happen fast before the m.u.r. arrives .
my people will be ready .
i am retribution .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
kursk .
milos ?
the bombing , my daughter -- all of it brings us here .
i did what i was told .
you &apos;re not the decembrist .
it was the american . it was him .
they gave the order !
what people ?
i can &apos;t say .
who is the decembrist ?
fitch .
his name is alan fitch .
milos , this you cannot do .
give me one reason .
because he &apos;s mine .
yours ?
he gave the orders , discredited you ,
and you want to protect him ?
this is not for you to do .
but i will .
alan fitch is dead .
call the florist .
the joint chiefs want another forward base .
that will only happen if we can convince islamabad .
which is unlikely .
it will happen
if we tether it to foreign military investment .
alan ?
sir , will you make the call ?
a little early in the day , don &apos;t you think , ray ?
i &apos;m still on moscow time .
just got back from calling on an old friend of yours --
kiryl morozov .
you met with the russian finance minister ?
to what end ?
to his end , as it turned out .
drink ?
the finance minister of russia is dead .
if a single word -- a whisper of this gets out ,
if anyone even suspects we sanctioned it --
i didn &apos;t sanction anything .
damn it , harold .
your team discovers morozov
was behind the kursk bombing ,
and 18 hours later , he &apos;s dead ?
reddington is behind this !
reddington called an hour ago .
he believes alan fitch &apos;s life is in danger .
did reddington bother to tell you why
berlin is suddenly interested in killing alan fitch ?
he believes he &apos;s the one who orchestrated the kursk bombing .
are you accusing the assistant director of national intelligence
of being a terrorist ?
we need to bring him in .
alan fitch is not your concern .
i &apos;ll contact the secretary of homeland security
and have the situation handled .
ray , will you listen ?
we had an agreement .
yes .
i don &apos;t go after you , you don &apos;t come after me .
i know the terms , ray .
but berlin predates it .
you ordered the bombing in kursk .
then you pinned it on me .
you blamed me for killing his daughter .
some years ago , a copy of this photo
was left on the corpse of an associate of mine .
taking it as a warning ,
i traced the girl to a man they call the stewmaker .
he told me a story about the girl .
she was sent to him by a man she &apos;d never met .
she was in trouble , needed to disappear ,
so he took her photo , put it in a locket ,
and sent it to her father .
all those years spent searching for the man
who supposedly murdered his daughter ,
and it was you .
you sat here in this very room
and pretended you had no idea who berlin was
or why he was coming for me .
he was coming , alan , because you sent him .
i sent a lot of guys .
you and i were not on the best of terms at the time .
and since you &apos;re playing the innocent victim in all this ,
let me remind you --
you stole some very damaging information about us
when you disappeared .
you violated our agreement .
no .
i honored it .
i got the others to hold off ,
but milos kirchhoff , berlin ,
whatever the hell name he &apos;s using ...
he chewed through the leash .
i couldn &apos;t stop him .
well , now your dog is tracking a new scent -- yours .
and there &apos;s nothing i can do about that , alan .
i have my people looking for him ,
but berlin has gone into the wind .
and he &apos;s coming for you .
you have no allies in my group .
without me to protect you , they &apos;ll take you down
and they &apos;ll let the chips fall where they may .
so this is as much your problem as it is mine .
sir , o.d.n.i. has credible intel
that there might be an attempt on your life .
what did they say ?
still waiting to hear .
they want to move you to fort mcnair
to do a full briefing .
deputy fitch , homeland security .
we need you to come with us .
guardian &apos;s en route . delivery on schedule .
our office has notified the university .
contact the d.c. field office .
get me an update on any eyewitnesses , satellite footage .
alan fitch &apos;s abduction must be on mossad &apos;s radar .
reach out to your people in tel aviv .
and you -- talk to him .
elizabeth , we need to talk . now .
tom .
what ?
you told me tom is dead . he &apos;s not .
who told you he &apos;s alive ?
i &apos;m disappointed you haven &apos;t felt
that you could trust me enough to tell me this .
look , okay , i lied .
but i only kept it a secret
because i know you want him dead .
no , you kept it a secret
because you didn &apos;t want to admit to yourself
that you still love him ,
that even after everything he has done ,
after how horribly he treated you ,
you still can &apos;t let him go .
so ... you &apos;re playing house .
i &apos;ve been using him as a source ,
and he &apos;s been incredibly valuable .
normally , any intelligence you could gather from tom keen
would be yesterday &apos;s news .
but berlin has gone to ground ,
and is likely dependent on former assets he used
when your husband was in his employ .
so it seems tom may be of some value after all .
i need to know everything he can tell you
about berlin &apos;s former safe houses , former contacts .
all that matters is finding alan fitch .
this ends now .
i already gave you berlin .
i told you where to find him .
yes . and he disappeared .
i did everything i could ... from in here .
forget it . i already told you --
and i told you it &apos;s the only way .
take a look , liz . this is a problem .
and time is not on your side .
i need information , not advice .
we both know that you are in over your head .
you are not equipped for this , liz ,
because you are not a killer .
it &apos;s why i &apos;m still alive
and why you &apos;ve got a corpse lying there
that you have done nothing with .
and your bodyguard , the one that you shot --
where do you think he is right now ?
he &apos;s getting a gun , liz ,
so he can come back here and kill me
and then probably kill you , too .
now , i told you -- there is a way out of this .
i can give you berlin ,
and all you have to do ...
is let me go .
gosh , he &apos;s a popular guy .
i bet somebody &apos;s gonna miss him .
berlin .
orenburg six .
scorpio .
that function is no longer valid .
wait , wait , listen .
tell him tom keen wants to talk .
liz , why would you do this ?
i mean , you &apos;re risking everything .
to find berlin .
you &apos;re a federal agent harboring a fugitive .
i mean , worse than that -- you &apos;re keeping him captive .
500 cops are out there looking for fitch right now ,
and we &apos;re gonna find him because of this .
i thought you were dead .
i need you to bring me in .
no .
listen to me .
i can help you .
well , time has passed . plans have changed .
i know you have fitch .
i know everything they know about you and your operation ,
and you &apos;re gonna want to hear it ,
but i &apos;m not telling you anything until you bring me in .
whether he leads us to fitch or not ,
i got to take him in .
are you hearing me ?
you had to know when you told me
that this is where it was gonna go .
i -- liz , i can &apos;t be part of this .
he &apos;s an informant , like reddington .
the difference is you &apos;re not in love with reddington .
i got an address .
where ?
where ? what difference does it make where ?
what ? you &apos;re gonna follow his lead
to someplace he says berlin is hiding ?
no . there could be 50 guys waiting .
that &apos;s stupid .
hey , shut up . i wasn &apos;t asking you .
you want berlin or not ?
there &apos;s no way i &apos;m gonna let you go in there .
this is a setup , an ambush .
what are you , her boyfriend ?
what address ?
3952 spalding street , apartment 24 .
hey , pal . i &apos;m coming for you .
good luck with that .
i think we have a problem .
clear it out . let &apos;s go . clear out . clear out .
looks like we &apos;re dealing with a plastic explosive --
c4 , approximately 2 kilos .
sir , the blasting cap &apos;s wired to a receiver .
we found our detonator .
this thing can be detonated remotely .
we need to jam the frequencies in case this nut job
tries to set it off and blow us to hell .
then you &apos;re gonna disarm it ?
we have a vehicle for controlled detonation .
it should be big enough to accommodate mr. fitch and one of my men .
once he &apos;s contained , then we can attempt
to disassemble and disarm the device .
well , how long is that thing gonna take to get here ?
half @-@ hour minimum ,
unless you &apos;ve got another r.f. resistant armored box that fits two .
actually , i think it fits four .
we managed to gain access to the internals ,
trying to circumvent the keypad .
here &apos;s what we got so far .
the semtex runs along the circumference of the collar ,
as you can see .
encased within that ,
approximately 14 inches of solid core wire
connected to a microprocessor
which , among other things , creates a closed circuit .
so if you cut the collar off ,
you interrupt the circuit and ... bang ?
then how do we disable it ?
cautiously .
we need to chip through the semtex
to see exactly what &apos;s underneath ,
make sure there aren &apos;t any redundant circuits or backups .
and you can do that without triggering that thing ?
we &apos;ll find out , won &apos;t we ?
look , i know i disobeyed a direct --
you found him . that &apos;s all that matters .
fill me in .
we got played , keen . i mean , look at it .
berlin &apos;s gone . tom &apos;s free .
he brought us fitch .
berlin handed us fitch on a silver platter
after he had a bomb strapped to his neck .
look , i &apos;ve been thinking about what i said in the car , and --
don &apos;t worry about it , ressler . i &apos;ll tell cooper .
i understand you &apos;re responsible for finding fitch .
about the source ...
yeah ?
does he have information about berlin ?
yes , we believe he does .
i don &apos;t care if your source is confidential
or what promises you &apos;ve made him .
i want him here , i want him interrogated ,
and i want his name .
you must be kidding .
do i sound like i &apos;m kidding ?
it &apos;s reddington .
her source is reddington .
please excuse my intrusion .
i &apos;m curious .
your father --
i assume he &apos;s been trying to reach you .
has he called ?
i thought as much .
sir , the device has a secondary detonator
built in as a safeguard .
what kind of safeguard ?
a timer .
we think it was activated
when the receiver broke radio contact .
how long do you have ?
it &apos;s unclear .
we can see the timing circuit , but there &apos;s no display .
it could be a minute . it could be an hour .
you &apos;re not hungry ?
it &apos;s fine .
let &apos;s get you something else .
whatever you like .
i can tell them to go .
no . i &apos;m the one who should go . i ...
no , no . they make you uncomfortable ?
i &apos;m glad you called .
you &apos;re scared .
i am , too .
i don &apos;t know how to talk to someone ...
like you .
i really should go .
no . please don &apos;t .
i know you have your life .
i have no place there . i know .
but i just want you to stay a little longer .
hello , milos .
thank you , my dear .
passports , tickets , and my eternal gratitude .
the bomb .
i need to know how to stop the bomb .
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s the wrong answer .
i &apos;m telling you i don &apos;t ...
think harder .
what &apos;s your name , son ?
what ?
your name . what -- what is it ?
sir , i need to be as still as possible .
any movement , the vibrations of your voice ...
do you have a wife , kids ?
that &apos;s what makes it the hardest --
a wife and kids .
i &apos;ve been in the intelligence field a long time now .
on my orders , 763 men and women have died
in service to their country .
and there wasn &apos;t a grieving wife or mother or husband
i didn &apos;t either call or visit personally .
thank them for their sacrifice .
that &apos;s what makes it the hardest --
the families .
you can &apos;t disarm it , can you ?
sir , i asked you to be as still as possible .
763 .
that &apos;s more than enough .
i &apos;m not gonna make it 764 .
what &apos;s your name ?
mike .
my name &apos;s mike .
go home , mike .
you &apos;ve done everything you can .
harold , i know you &apos;re listening .
tell ray i need to see him .
what a long , strange trip it &apos;s been , alan .
listen to me , ray .
i don &apos;t know how much time we have ,
so you need to pay attention .
i &apos;ve been able to hold everyone off ,
convince them that it &apos;s in their best interests to let you live .
but people aren &apos;t as scared as they once were .
some aren &apos;t so sure you even have it .
do you have it , ray ?
do you have the fulcrum ?
they &apos;re gonna demand proof .
i can &apos;t stop this thing , alan .
i tried .
i can &apos;t .
my death will trigger a series of events .
the moderates are already outnumbered .
the closer we get to 2017,
the more radicalized they &apos;ll become .
talk to mitchum and hobbs .
they might be persuaded .
jasper sides with the chinese --
all right . listen to me , ray . this is critical .
i have a safe . get to it .
the combination --
8 @-@ 30 @-@ 44 .
remember that . say it back .
8 @-@ 30 @-@ 44 .
8 @-@ 30 @-@ 44 .
margaret &apos;s birthday .
you &apos;ve had a wonderful life together , alan .
51 years last month .
the safe .
the safe .
it &apos;s in st. petersburg
in the wall on the second floor of --
untie him .
thank you .
na zdorov &apos;e .
na zdorov &apos;e .
i remember the parades from when i was a young boy ,
standing by my father ,
seeing those trucks that went by
with the rockets and cannons .
beautiful .
and all those men marching as one ,
saluting at me as one .
our soldiers , our nation .
yuri gargarin was the first man in space .
we were so proud .
your gentleman friend with the earring
said he moved the body .
mr. kaplan is with him now .
we &apos;re trying to contain the situation .
you should have come to me .
i didn &apos;t need to .
look around you , lizzy .
we found fitch because of tom .
it wasn &apos;t worth it --
not if the cost was you ,
here in this ...
filth .
i couldn &apos;t do it .
i told you i could kill tom ,
but ... after you left , i just ...
♬ look up to the sky and leave this world behind you ♬
after all the lies and everything he did to me ,
i told myself i was using him ,
that i was finally in control .
when you love someone , you have no control .
that &apos;s what love is --
being powerless .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with me .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with you .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with you .
♬ but can you move and shake ♬
♬ are you a dead man or a fake ♬
♬ are you a dead man or a fake ♬
♬ are you a dead man or a fake ♬
do you have it ?
♬ see this world around you ♬
♬ there will be no hesitation ♬
♬ there will be no hesitation ♬
♬ but can you move and shake ♬
you are never to see her again .
♬ are you a dead man or a fake ♬
yeah . i got it .
i don &apos;t think you do .
look at me .
you are never to see her again .
you know , for what it &apos;s worth ,
i spent four months on that ship chained up ...
and i never told her about us .
not one word .
