hi , it &apos;s been 20 minutes . have you decided ?
uh , we still need more time ,
can you come back ?
sure .
and i &apos;m back .
come on guys you &apos;re not buying a house .
everything sucks .
pick the thing that sucks the least , and put it in you mouth .
max , everyone keeps telling me
they can &apos;t decide , it &apos;s like a support group for bi @-@ sexuals .
something very magical about to happen ...
please let it be the rapture . i need a day off .
活着的基督徒被送到天上与基督同在
in two minutes , something very hip is happening .
if you have a camera ,
make sure the flash is on .
why is he speaking like that ?
wait a minute .
no one &apos;s ordering .
people keep checking the time on their phones .
everyone &apos;s wearing matching new balance sneakers .
flash mob !
透过互联网或者短信 相约在指定地点同时做出特定动作
oh , hell , no !
caroline , earl , code red !
i couldn &apos;t stop disco ,
but i &apos;ll be damned if any more of that crap gets by me .
why is flash mob over ?
flash mobs were over a year ago .
nobody told han !
i want so bad to be hip .
start by never saying that again .
hello ?
max , phone !
no !
what are you doing ?
never answer the wall phone !
what ? why ?
only two people call the wall ...
collection agencies and the landlord ,
looking for the original tenant whose name is on the lease !
hang up . quick !
too late .
i &apos;ve got to man up and face it .
hello ?
this is what collection agency ?
no , my granddaughter max is not here .
she died .
on her deathbed , she said it was the stress
of being constantly harassed by creditors .
that &apos;s juvenile .
give me the phone .
hi . so sorry about that .
what &apos;s the issue exactly ?
well , i &apos;m sure she has every intention ...
well , you &apos;re a doody head .
never answer the wall .
but what are you gonna do about it ?
you can &apos;t just keep lying to collection agencies .
you have to pay your bills .
i have a system .
i pay everyone five dollars a week ...
just enough to keep them from freaking out .
it &apos;s the methadone @-@ clinic banking system .
that is a complete waste of money .
five dollars won &apos;t even cover the interest you &apos;re accruing .
what &apos;s the interest rate on your credit card ?
don &apos;t know , but my interest rate in the conversation is zero .
max , how could you not know that ?
that &apos;s one of the first things my father taught me about finance .
where ... at embezzle u. ?
max , i interned at merrill lynch .
let me help you with this . it &apos;s the least i can do .
i had nowhere to go . you took me in .
let me repay my debt to you by helping with your debt
to everyone in the world , apparently .
if you keep talking ,
i &apos;m going to merrill lynch myself .
i &apos;m one of those people
who gets off on untangling big , complicated messes .
and since you won &apos;t let me do your hair ,
let me do your bills .
you want to do my bills ?
here &apos;s my portfolio .
and , uh , if you find chocolate sprinkles in there ,
they &apos;re not chocolate ...
or sprinkles .
okay .
i &apos;ve divided your bills into three categories ...
&quot; impossible , &quot;
&quot; next to impossible , &quot;
and &quot; how the hell did that happen ? &quot;
and i &apos;ve divided my roommate into three categories ...
&quot; annoying , &quot;
&quot; super annoying , &quot;
and &quot; how the hell did that happen ? &quot;
i &apos;m closing kitchen in ten minutes .
i cannot stay later .
i have date with new woman in my life .
she &apos;s very special to me .
i think she may be the one .
you are both welcome to come watch us have sex .
just putting it out there .
just put it back in there .
i &apos;m so excited , i don &apos;t even know where to start .
drumroll , please .
no ? okay .
oh , interesting .
here we have a bill from the pet castle ,
yet you don &apos;t have a pet , and you &apos;ve never been to a castle ...
oh , except white castle .
you used a credit card at white castle ?
yep . that was good weed .
and the pet thing was &apos; cause i found a stray
and had to have her cleaned up
before i could get anyone to take her .
that would also explain the charge for neutering .
nah , actually , that was for me .
can &apos;t have any more of these coming out .
do you really think it &apos;s fiscally smart to be taking in strays ?
good point .
move out tonight .
what is this ... a student loan ?
oh , my god . max , you went to college ?
that wasn &apos;t a judgment . it was just shocking ...
kind of like seeing a baby smoke on the internet .
i love that kid .
max , a student loan is the worst bill you can ignore .
it can never be expunged .
we &apos;re breaking out &quot; expunged &quot; on a weeknight ?
you can &apos;t run away from this bill .
i can run away from anything .
i &apos;m on my fifth identity .
it &apos;s just like that but underwater !
guys !
sorry , we &apos;re just closing , guys .
i &apos;ll take them , max . we need the ...
uh , sit anywhere .
what was that roadrunner move you just pulled ?
there &apos;s still a smoke outline of your body
hanging in the air out there .
did wile e. coyote just come in the diner ?
no , but my ex @-@ boyfriend did .
meep , meep .
why is william in brooklyn ?
why is william in this diner ?
why is every inbred rich guy named william ?
i don &apos;t want to see him .
max , close the door .
i don &apos;t want him to come in here .
yeah , &apos; cause that happens all the time .
customers come in the front door
and make a beeline through the kitchen
to see if there &apos;s a waitress hiding in the walk @-@ in freezer .

&apos;cause i can give you a run for your money .
i don &apos;t have any money .
well , with a body like that , you don &apos;t need any .
oh ! ba @-@ bam !

or is that what you do
so the check gets paid by richie rich ?
hold on . who said i was rich ?

and never call or text or email ?
seriously .
you wouldn &apos;t know what to do with a good girl if you had one .
but you &apos;re not a good girl . that &apos;s why i want your number .
so how about it ?
we &apos;re closed .
your sign says &quot; open till 2 : 00 . &quot;

what did i ever do to you ?
you didn &apos;t mention me , did you ?
ugh , no . i just gave him ...
just get to the end . do you hate him ?
i hate him .
that was the weirdest thing , seeing him come in here .
no , the weirdest thing is coming in here right now .
why no ?
girl at urban outfitters said it was hip .
you look like a lesbian i made out with once on a dare .
han , you &apos;re adorable exactly as you are .
why are you trying to be hip ?
to meet girls .
it &apos;s not that bad in here .
i thought my first trip to a laundromat
would be a lot more depressing .
six years we spent together ,
and now he won &apos;t even look at me .
oh , not the bag .
i just looked at his bag ... now yours ?
max , it &apos;s driving me crazy .
what did you major in in college ?
i majored in changing topics .
so what did you ever see in your ex ,
the lost winklevoss twin ?
we &apos;re not talking about william .
we &apos;re talking about your bills .
well , i &apos;m talking about your bill !
oh , face !
max ... we &apos;re trying to start a cupcake business .
and i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m about to say this
but with my father &apos;s financial baggage ,
you &apos;re our best chance for credit .
listen , everybody &apos;s broke in their 20s .
and everybody hides from stuff .
you run into freezers .
i practice ignorance and blackout drinking .
what &apos;s happening right now ?
hola , dudarinos .
the laundromat &apos;s closing early .
we &apos;ve rented it out for our &apos; 80s pop @-@ up disco party .
bobby .
shouldn &apos;t it be called an &quot; &apos; 80s pop @-@ up lame hipster
will do anything to be ironic and lame &quot; party ?
&quot; lame &quot; ?
don &apos;t think so .
what ?
vicki from small wonder is coming ?
embarrassed to be you right now .
unless you chicks have 75 disco @-@ lovin &apos; bucks ,
be gone in ten minutes ,
or my man here will throw you out .
don &apos;t let his tube top fool you .
bobby is mad wiry .
i &apos;m wiry .
small wonder ?
is that the show on tlc
about the little @-@ people magicians ?
no .
it &apos;s an &apos; 80s sitcom about this little girl robot
who lives with a loving family .
a girl robot ?
that &apos;s totally unbelievable .
no , that &apos;s totally awesome !
the unbelievable part is the loving family .
i love vicki .
she had no emotions and was empty inside .
my role model ! we &apos;re staying .
$ 75 ? to do what ...
stand here and dance next to ...
guy @-@ girl and girl @-@ guy over there ?
come on , chestnut ,
go poo @-@ poo near the hipsters .
hey , how cool would it be
if we could get chess to go poo on a hipster ?
how can all of those people have $ 75
just to dance at a laundromat ?
i &apos;ve been doing my roots with white @-@ out ?
hipsters in williamsburg will pay for anything
if it makes them feel like they &apos;re in on something new
no one else knows about .
all you need &apos;s a gimmick .
dudes !
can we ride your horse ?
sure . 100 bucks .
okay . i got to go to the atm .
wait . stay right there . we &apos;ll be right back .
oh , my god .
max , we are literally looking our gift horse in the mouth .
we have something that &apos;s better than an &apos; 80s disco party .
we have a horse .
if we throw a big enough party ,
charge hipsters for horse rides ,
we could pay off your student loan !
you &apos;d whore out chestnut like that ?
don &apos;t you have to get him hooked on heroin first ?
max , i &apos;ve got this .
i &apos;m a brilliant event planner .
my sweet 16 was off the chain ...
penthouse party , pink and black theme .
alanis morissette sang songs from jagged little pill .
《 小碎药丸 》 是其最成功的专辑
on my 16th birthday ,
my mom took too many jagged little pills ,
and i had to drive her to the emergency room
to get her stomach pumped .
was your childhood based on the novel push by sapphire ?
i wish !
the theme is &apos; 90s horse party .
it &apos;s exactly the kind of hip event you &apos;re dying to be a part of .
it would happen after closing ,
so it won &apos;t affect business .
and all the horse rides will take place out back .
so no damage will come to the diner .
but why would i say yes to giving up my diner
for no cash return ?
you might get laid .
great !
the &apos; 90s horse party is happening on thursday .
fantastic . any other questions ?
yes .
what exactly is possibility
of percentage of me ...
getting laid ?
all i can say is ,
with the cute &apos; 90s @-@ themed @-@ clothing incentive
and the trivia contest ,
lots of cute hipster girls will be here looking to ...
get laid !
i will go now and start to research
american trivia facts about the 1990s .
you realize we &apos;re gonna have to give him something ...
like flash a little boob , something .
i feel like han &apos;s more of an ass man .
good point ... &apos; cause his head is right there .
oleg , what &apos;s up ?
not enjoying the &apos; 90s horse party ?
i thought you said &quot; &apos; 90s whores party . &quot;
now i &apos;m wearing girdle and deodorant for no reason .
quite a turnout , max .
reminds me of the after @-@ hours clubs i used to go to ,
you know , if all the cool cats shooting dope
were replaced by sad , white fools sipping light beer .
look !
i did research and make myself a 1990s trivia t @-@ shirt .
&quot; talk to the hand &quot; 字面是跟手 / 憨说话 其实是 &quot; 懒得理你 &quot;
&quot; talk to the han . &quot;
get it ?
&quot; talk to the han ! &quot;
that actually is cool .
i am hoping it will help me ...
get laid ?
care to purchase a tamagotchi
or a 90210 @-@ reo cupcake ?
we came here wanting to hate on you chicks hard .
but that horse you got out back is mad cool .
you bested us , party beast .
and to that , i doff my cap .
how much are the cupcakes ?
$ 10 each .
ooh , i doff my cap again , my lady .
max , look at all this .
we &apos;re a success !
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s not a success ...
the plan to get han some action .
look at him over there .
that &apos;s so sad .
i know .
go over there and give him a &quot; han &quot; job .
william !
meep , meep .
you realize this is a freezer , not a panic room , right ?
just go out there
and tear his smug , white ass a new one .
i can &apos;t face him , max .
why ? he &apos;s the one who didn &apos;t call you .
i can &apos;t face him because i &apos;m a waitress .
last time he saw me ,
i was a billionaire in a townhouse .
now i &apos;m a waitress in a walk @-@ in freezer .
so , when you were laying around on your trust fund ,
doing nothing every day ,
having other people scrub your toilet ,
you could hold your head up high ?
but now that you support yourself
by earning your own money , that &apos;s somehow shameful ?
who cares what he thinks ?
he is the guy who just paid $ 100 to party with a horse .
he &apos;s the loser , not you .
really ? &apos; cause he &apos;s out there having fun ,
and i &apos;m in here ,
hugging a tub of expired blue cheese .
look ...
you see that wad of cash in your hand ?
you earned that .
slap that wad in your palm a few times !
feel its power .
that &apos;s all you got ?
come on , really squeeze that wad !
feels good in your hands , right ?
feels pretty good .
yeah .
now slap it and say , &quot; this is my wad ! &quot;
this is my wad .
this is my wad !
this is my wad !
go out there .
i &apos;m going out there !
as soon as the ladies calm down .
are you kidding ?
show him what he &apos;s missing . let &apos; em pop , playa !
where are you , you rich poseur ?
listen up !
that was meant exclusively for one specific rich poseur .
all you other rich poseurs ,
just continue with the &apos; 90s !
where is he ? do you see him ?
uh , no . he was right over there .
he &apos;s gone .
i don &apos;t get to shove this in his face .
it would &apos;ve been nice to put my wad
in his face for a change .
oh , speaking of wads , look over there .
he &apos;s such a little pimp .
are you okay ?
yeah . actually , i am .
i guess i didn &apos;t need to go over there
and make some big , dramatic speech ,
telling him that even though i &apos;m a waitress ,
i &apos;m better than him .
i know that now . thank you .
and when i see him one day in the future ,
i &apos;ll be happy to tell him that .
he just came out of the men &apos;s room .
let &apos;s get out of here !
what ? i thought you wanted to talk to him !
i said , &quot; the future . &quot; this is the &apos; 90s .
let &apos;s get out of here . run !
feels good running away from your bill , huh ?
so great .
see , that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been saying .
well , at least you don &apos;t have to run from your student loan bill .
we can pay that off
and still have $ 50 for the cupcake fund .
i hate that college won .
didn &apos;t you get anything out of it ?
you mean , besides mono
and an art teacher whose idea of finger @-@ painting
常在青少年间通过唾液传染的疾病
was a little more &quot; finger &quot; than &quot; painting &quot; ?
art teacher ?
max , was that your major ... art ?
keep your eyes on the road . you &apos;re driving .
i just thought for , like , a second ,
i could maybe illustrate children &apos;s books .
max , that &apos;s so sweet .
you &apos;re not like vicki at all .
max , look . han !
aw , our little somethin &apos; -somethin&apos;
got him a little somethin &apos; -somethin &apos; !
i doff my cap , milady !
