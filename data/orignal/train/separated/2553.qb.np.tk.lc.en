wow , an indoor water park .
hopefully , this will put the final nail in the coffin
of lakes and rivers .
well , as a mother , i ...
we all know you &apos;re a mother .
as a mother , i like that wherever i look ,
i can see a lifeguard .
i &apos;m finding nemo !
i saw heaven !
my head !
mom ! bart got my hair wet ,
and i wasn &apos;t ready to get it wet yet !
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re going in the kiddie pool .
oh . i &apos;ve had baths that were more exciting . baths !
oh , my god , a plastic ring .
out of my way , you little twerps !
i want that ring .
hey , uh , do you have any waterslides
for the gentleman of leisurely proportions ?
right this way , sir .
this park specializes in extra @-@ wide
double @-@ reinforced tubing for the modern american fatso .
oh , well .
cola wars veteran coming through !
i &apos;m exercising !
awesome .
milhouse , how long you been waiting in line ?
you mean you didn &apos;t use the app last week
to get your slammin &apos; salmon line number ?
what are you , amish ?
all right , time to thin out the herd .
attention , bathers ,
this is water park president cal a. bunga .
do not panic , but the pools are infested
with those tiny fish that swim up your wiener .
get out of the way !
again , do not panic .
if you think a wiener fish has entered your dingus ,
the only cure is to roll around naked in the snow .
uh , lou , i need a big favor from you .
oh , man . i ... they don &apos;t train you for this at the academy .
well , they should .
yes !
oh , dear god ! bio breach !
that poor raccoon !
isn &apos;t anyone gonna do anything ?
he committed nature &apos;s greatest crime : coming inside .
no heartbeat .
finally , a chance to use my online cpr training .
one , two , three , four , five .
one , two , three , four , five .
lisa has a boyfriend !
lisa has a boyfriend !
oh , a boyfriend ?
and raccoons are such good providers .
come on , come on .
you have so much more trash to eat .
steal one more breath , noble bandit .
it worked . i saved you .
my first rescue .
and my first real kiss .
she &apos;d have chosen me if i was wearing a real bathing suit .
for once , a life saved at a springfield water park ,
where a quick @-@ thinking second grader
performed emergency cpr on a drowning nuisance animal ,
while dozens of unheroic onlookers just stood around .
where was channel six news ?
filming gas pumps and their ever @-@ changing prices .
which accomplishes what ? i don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s eight minutes left .
uh , did we do gas prices ?
yes !
we saw you on the picture radio .
they chyroned your name .
they described you as &quot; local girl . &quot;
hubba , hubba .
they sure got that right .
lisa , it looks like you &apos;re the perfect student
to look after nibbles the hamster here during spring break .
i &apos;d take him with me ,
but i &apos;m doing jell @-@ o shots with former students .
this spring break , i &apos;m gonna go wild with responsibility !
my dad &apos;s spending spring break in a cage , too .
and for saving that raccoon , i got the opposite of teasing .
i bet the germans have a word for it ,
like , uh , gerstronkenplatzen or something .
i wish the germans had a word for this terrible traffic .
and so ends the moment being about me .
what &apos;s going on , chief ?
oh , nasty car crash .
can &apos;t let traffic through
until the cleanup crew mops up this mess .
which is a problem ,
because they &apos;re stuck in traffic behind you .
okay , who did that ? !
we need to get home .
i left my father @-@ in @-@ law on the sofa .
he &apos;s got to be turned .
yeah , well , that ain &apos;t gonna happen .
not unless you clean up this accident scene .
actually , seriously , could you do that ?
hmm , i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m one of those people who doesn &apos;t like
being traumatized by horrifying sights .
marge , do you know why i became a cop ?
if you do , could you tell me ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s really dangerous .
b @-@ but these crime scene cleanups , they &apos;re totally safe .
all the bad people are dead or , uh , at large .
so give it a shot .
please . please , mom .
oh , all right .
there you go . spick and span .
wow , you even made the homeless guy look nice .
yeah , still crazy though .
you know , marge , uh , you ever want some fast extra cash ,
we are always looking for crime scene cleaner @-@ uppers .
you know what they say : crime always pays .
plus , you can keep any money you find ,
and any jewelry that isn &apos;t monogrammed .

hello , little girl .
oh , does your hamster have tyzzer &apos;s disease ?
that would &apos;ve been interesting ,
but i swabbed him for tyzzer &apos;s and it came up negative .
my . you certainly know a lot about animals .
that &apos;s just it , i do .
i saved a raccoon &apos;s life the other day .
it was the best feeling i &apos;ve ever had .
is there any way i could work in your office ?
i mean , as an intern or anything ?
oh , do you know how many people walk in here every day
looking for just such a thing ?
a lot , i bet .
no , it &apos;s never happened .
grab a clean smock and follow me .
oh , okay !
i can &apos;t find a clean smock .
then your first job is to clean the smocks .
i &apos;m ready , dr. budgie .
oh , it &apos;s a shame to ruin such a clean smock ,
but , uh , let &apos;s go .
this is heaven .
you got to help me , doc .
my pet ferret has lost its terrible stink !
well , that won &apos;t do .
let me have a go at jump @-@ starting the old stink gland .
lisa , my dear , can you restrain the ferret ?
it would be my honor .
clear !
we have stink lines !
well done , lisa .
heaven !
all right , veggie kibble for daisy here .
chairman meow is having surgery tomorrow ,
so only liquid for you .
and no more food for you , mr. snake ,
until you finish shedding your skin .
oh . you have .
dr. budgie , i &apos;m really enjoying cleaning out these cages .
no , really , i am , but are there any jobs that are more exciting ?
absolutely .
you can hobble these crickets .
we have a hungry chameleon who &apos;s slowing down with age ,
but he still loves the thrill of the hunt .
mm . anything more life or deathy ?
i could take the animals &apos; temperature .
i know what that means , and i am up for it .
oh , lisa , slow down .
do you know how many awkward courses i had to take
before they let me put my arm inside a horse ?
i understand .
i just feel like i could be doing more .
oh , you remind me of a certain young man
growing up in stratfordshire @-@ on @-@ corningwell .
he , too , was impatient .
always thinking he could do more .
was that you ?
no . if that was me , i would have said &quot; me . &quot;
this eager beaver had to leave veterinary school
and become-- ugh-- a people doctor .
and with the 27th pick of the 14th round
of the nhl draft , the phoenix coyotes select ...
lubochuck , lubochuck , lubochuck , lubochuck .
... cédric bélanger .
but lubochuck .
homie , i think we need a new ceiling fan .
the old one doesn &apos;t seem safe .
it &apos;s fine . and it saves us money on haircuts .
not bad ,
but i miss the social aspects of the barbershop .
the st. louis blues are now on the clock .
lubochuck , lubochuck , lubochuck , lubochuck .
springfield pd .
pd ... police department !
ha ! i just got that .
chief , chief , this is marge simpson .
i think i &apos;d like to do some of those crime scene cleanups .
oh , great , great .
hey , i got a job for you right here .
uh , murder @-@ suicide .
or possibly a suicide @-@ murder .
just bring a mop and your imagination .
hey , it can &apos;t be worse than what i &apos;ve seen .
homer , i told you not to eat chili out of the colander !
uh , it &apos;s pronounced &quot; calendar . &quot;
what &apos;s the matter , little guy ?
you haven &apos;t touched your berries .
do you need aphids for flavor ?
aphids .
lisa , could you come here for a moment ?
at last .
i &apos;m trying to give this saint bernard a shot ,
but my hands are a little shaky .
i had an extra gallon of tea for lunch .
oh , my .
if i hold him , do you think
you could attend to the matter of the needle ?
of course !
careful , careful .
a single millimeter either way
would not make much of a difference .
huh . why am i not feeling
the same rush i did with the raccoon ?
there it is !
be careful , mrs. s.
i &apos;ve never seen an angel @-@ dust @-@ for @-@ guns swap go so wrong .
hey , a mess is a mess .
let me start with this filthy crime scene tape .
yarr , is the doctor in , miss ?
little goldie here is listing hard to starboard .
i fear he may have tangled with the wrong plastic diver .
hmm . could be fin rot .
oh , no , not the big f.
do what you must . i &apos;ll say my good @-@ byes .
you were more wife to me than any woman i ever knew .
captain , the diagnosis of fin rot
is not the death sentence it used to be .
a couple drops of medicine in the water , and he &apos;ll be fine .
yarr , that &apos;s amazing !
eh , i &apos;ve just got one more little problem .
he , uh ... he ate me car keys .
hurry , doc ! his lungs are full of seltzer !
homie ? notice anything ?
um , are you having an affair ?
what ? no .
i bought a new ceiling fan . huh ?
ooh , i thought the air felt a little more lively .
but where did you get the money ?
actually , i made a little extra by cleaning up crime scenes .
what ? poor marge .
i heard that can really mess you ...
oh , baby , that cool air is sweet !
... up .
are you sure you &apos;re not living a waking nightmare ?
no . not one little bit .
and i get the police discount on cleaning supplies .
i can finally clean grampa &apos;s dentures .
yeah , i got popcorn in there from kramer vs. kramer .
i was rooting for kramer ,
but was dismayed when kramer finally won .
that &apos;s a twist i didn &apos;t see kramer .
happy birthday , martin . where &apos;s the gift table ?
right over there , my friend .
some zoo . where are the rental strollers ?
actually , it &apos;s not so bad .
the animals are healthy .
a couple of paddock scrapes , but nothing overly concerning .
oh , knock it off . you &apos;re not a vet .
you &apos;re a glorified cage scrubber .
dr. budgie depends upon me !
i have felt the cold breath of kennel cough in my face .
i have seen tabbies that were more tick than cat .
i know why the caged dog scoots .
so when your lizard loses its tail ,
you &apos;re gonna need me to tell you it &apos;s gonna grow back .
want some peanuts , mr. elephant ?
uh , it &apos;s a goat , not an elephant ,
and those are shrimp , not peanuts .
and that goat is allergic to shrimp !
your breath smells like &quot; don &apos;t drink that . &quot;
milhouse , give me your epipen !
you &apos;re not a professional .
i am a self @-@ selected unpaid veterinary intern .
now let me practice my craft !
hey , he &apos;s as good as new .
look at him play with the kids !
see , bart ? life or death .
i make the choice .
okay , time to cut the cake .
that &apos;s my patient .
guess what , sweetie .
i &apos;m wearing my snuggle socks .
they &apos;re compression socks from your heart surgery .
all the same ...
i &apos;m not in the mood .
what ? ! you &apos;ve never said that before !
i &apos;ve thought it three times .
each time was after a burrito @-@ eating contest .
but i won !
what &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s just that seeing you , lying down ,
reminds me of this bloated corpse i had to clean up today .
hey , i look damn good for someone who eats the crap i do .
maybe we should just go to sleep .
i wasn &apos;t done with my drink .
would you like my itty @-@ bitty booze light ?
i &apos;ve never seen him like this . he &apos;s so listless .
who &apos;s lost the urge to kill ?
who &apos;s lost the urge to kill ?
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s wrong with him : you .
what ? me ? !
this dog is badly behind on his shots .
he &apos;s displaying the symptoms of early onset parvo .
i &apos;m confiscating your dog .
and , you , get out !
smithers , i &apos;ve been shamed .
prepare a thimble of ice cream .
some people don &apos;t deserve to own pets .
and you get to decide who ?
don &apos;t fold your arms at me .
lis , look at yourself .
you &apos;ve become so arrogant , you &apos;ve forgotten who you are .
and even worse , you &apos;ve forgotten nibbles !
nibbles !
my pet ! my responsibility !
my homework !
matted hair , dry tongue ...
is this true , lisa ?
did you let this happen to a creature in your care ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m so , so sorry .
pet hamsters need to be played with regularly ,
or they feel abandoned .
and that can lead to stress polyps on the heart .
the heart is the seat of love , lisa .
if you &apos;d gone to veterinary school , you &apos;d know that .
i &apos;ve got no choice but to operate .
and i need your help .
you still want me to help you after i was so arrogant ?
lisa , arrogance is what made the british empire .
then lost it .
then pretended it didn &apos;t happen .
well , we &apos;ve done all we can .
the next 24 hours will be crucial .
oh , he &apos;s gone .
no , no , no .
he can &apos;t be dead !
he can &apos;t !
i thought we could save every animal if we just cared enough .
okay , marge , sweetie , look at this one .
see , marge ?
the baby laughs every time the toaster pops .
it is pretty hysterical .
that &apos;s nice .
nice ? something in you is dead , marge ,
and that &apos;s one crime scene you can &apos;t clean up .
and all for a fan .
a stupid ceiling fan that ...
oh , man , that &apos;s refreshing .
i want my marge back .
hello ? what is it , boy ?
i see .
fine , marge .
you sit here , watch your boob tube , have a beer .
that &apos;s not how homer simpson does things .
i have to go help lisa !
lisa ?
wait ! wait , i &apos;m coming with you .
no answer .
i guess we got to do this ourselves .
oh , geez .
all right , get some paper towels , boys .
lisa .
oh , mom , he trusted me as only a hamster can !
if there &apos;s one thing i &apos;ll always clean up ,
it &apos;s my baby &apos;s tears .
you would &apos;ve never let anything
i should &apos;ve
happen to him .
been here for you .
i was too busy being dead inside ...
wherever he went ,
i hope they have hamster balls .
... doing i don &apos;t know what !
but i &apos;m here now , and i &apos;ll never leave .
well , i &apos;ll be .
lisa &apos;s learning about death helped marge feel again .
yes , a perfect dovetail .
thank you for curing walter pigeon here .
i can &apos;t afford to pay you ,
but i can give you front row seats to my magic show .
the theme is boxing .
sounds marvelous .
oh , yeah , no . come on , it is .
