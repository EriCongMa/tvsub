i must say , penny , this is great fun .
glad you &apos;re enjoying yourself .
until i met you and bernadette , my trips to the bathroom
had been entirely focused on elimination .
now they have a delightful social aspect .
amy , you must &apos;ve been in the bathroom
with other women before .
of course i have .
but they were strangers and seemed off @-@ put
when i engaged in friendly stall @-@ to @-@ stall chit @-@ chat .
some women don &apos;t like to get chummy
when their panties are down .
you okay in there , bestie ?
i &apos;m fine ...
the reason i ask is that many people
experience bladder shyness ;
the inability to pass uri ...
yeah , i said i &apos;m fine . stop talking to me .
she always this crabby when she urinates ?
we &apos;re really not that close .
screw it . i &apos;ll go later .
and i &apos;ll be right by your side .
did i tell you priya invited
me and howard to have dinner with her and leonard ?
oh , that &apos;s nice .
no , it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s a strategic maneuver .
leonard &apos;s new girlfriend is testing bernadette &apos;s loyalty
to you and the group .
that bitch is crafty .
you think ?
of course .
how does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests ?
by going after its weakest member .
well , what makes me the weakest member ?
your trusting nature coupled with your teeny @-@ tiny body .
you wouldn &apos;t last a minute on the serengeti .
okay , amy , you &apos;re being silly .
i &apos;m not concerned about who hangs out with who .
and i certainly don &apos;t have a problem
with leonard &apos;s new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup .
ooh , these are cute .
of course if i buy them ,
i &apos;ll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple .
it doesn &apos;t matter . i &apos;m going to tell her we can &apos;t make it .
oh , no . you &lt; i &gt; have &lt; / i &gt; to go .
i don &apos;t understand .
i thought i was a teeny @-@ tiny wildebeest .
you are-- with hair that smells like strawberries .
and we &apos;re going to use that to our advantage .
wait . what are you talking about ?
by accepting the invitation , bernadette becomes
a double agent inside the enemy camp .
she could ferret out priya &apos;s tactics ,
identify her weaknesses
and feed her false information , such as :
leonard &apos;s no stranger to back @-@ alley cockfights .
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m not a very good liar .
they kind of whup that out of you in catholic school .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll teach you .
i did two years of cub scouts
before they found out i was a girl .
okay , i don &apos;t know you people .
i &apos;m just an innocent woman wondering
if this shoe store will take my texaco card .
how do you feel about concealing a recording device
in the cleavage of your ample bosom ?
i don &apos;t want anything in my ample bosom .
come on , strawberries . take one for the team .
okay , see you later .
good news .
i finally have a handle on my idea for three @-@ person chess .
that is good news . bye .
uh , do you know how i solved
the balanced center combat @-@ area problem ?
five words :
transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation .
that ... that &apos;s brilliant .
it &apos;s what i do .
but wait , there &apos;s more .
i also invented two new chess pieces .
the serpent ... and the old woman .
okay , now i have to ask . what do they do ?
when the serpent slithers to an opposing player &apos;s piece ,
that piece is considered poisoned
and will die after two more moves .
all right .
unless ... it gets to the old woman in time ,
in which case she sucks out the poison ,
turning her into the grand empress :
a piece combining the power
of the knight , queen and serpent .
elegant .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s simple .
okay , well , i look forward to playing with you .
and ...
and what ?
and a third person .
it &apos;s three @-@ person chess .
i must say , ever since you started
having regular intercourse , your mind has lost its keen edge .
you should reflect on that .
excuse me , but einstein had a pretty busy sex life .
yes , and he never unified gravity with the other forces .
if he hadn &apos;t been such a hound dog ,
we &apos;d all have time machines .
got it . bye .
you know i &apos;m right .
i think he &apos;s getting worse .
oh , my metatarsal are barking .
you okay ? yeah , yeah .
i &apos;m just breaking in some new shoes .
very pretty .
thank you .
did you know that women wear high heels
to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent ?
hadn &apos;t really thought about it .
look .
uh , sure . very ... prominent .
please , leonard , don &apos;t leer ,
you have a girlfriend .
sorry .
so , are you off to dinner
with priya , howard and bernadette ?
yeah . how did you know ?
i heard it at the mall ,
when i was shopping with my girlfriends ,
&apos;cause , you know , that &apos;s kind of my life now .
have a good night .
try not to ogle my caboose as i walk away .
hey , raj , will you be joining us for dinner ?
the lonely guy and the two happy couples ?
i &apos;d rather get a prostate exam
from a leper who walks away with nine fingers .
oh , would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself ?
i have to feel sorry for myself .
i &apos;m the only one who cares .
just like i &apos;m the only one who &apos;ll have sex with me .
really ? in front of your sister ?
we shared a room growing up .
this is not news to me .
excuse me . i &apos;m going to go wander the streets alone .
invisible , unwanted and unloved .
a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart .
i forgot my windbreaker . it &apos;chilly .
i don &apos;t understand . is this a way to break in new shoes ?
no . once these puppies touch the ground
they &apos;re mine , and i &apos;ll have to wear them
walking up and down hollywood boulevard
in order to pay them off .
pretty , pretty , pretty .
good news : the wildebeest is in the curry .
the what ?
bernadette is with priya and leonard .
message received .
commence operation &quot; priya wouldn &apos;t wanna be @-@ ya . &quot;
hey . seriously ?
didn &apos;t you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school ?
i wish . a clique requires friends .
i didn &apos;t have any .
none ?
i used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room
and eat with the janitor .
it was nice until his wife called me a &lt; i &gt; puta &lt; / i &gt;
and made me stop .
hang on .
it &apos;s the wildebeest .
priya just made a snide comment about your acting career .
w @-@ what the hell did she say ?
she thinks it &apos;s cool you &apos;re following your dream ,
no matter what .
that bitch !
how do you want to handle it ?
um , okay .
tell bernadette to tell priya that
i &apos;m on my way to prague
to shoot a movie with angelina jolie .
got it .
is it going to be in 3 @-@ d ?
what ? i don &apos;t know . it doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;m gonna say 3 @-@ d.
that &apos;ll let her know the studio has faith in it .
you &apos;re kidding . 3 @-@ d ?
that &apos;s what i hear .
then the studio must have real faith in it .
wonder why she didn &apos;t &lt; i &gt; tell &lt; / i &gt; me .
have you been spending time with your ex @-@ girlfriend ?
no ...
then why are you surprised she didn &apos;t tell you ?
well , it &apos;s not as much &quot; surprised &quot; as ...
you know ... uh ... the other thing .
what other thing ?
well , if you ... uh ...
i don &apos;t ... oh ...
what &apos;s the word i &apos;m looking for ?
i &apos;m not going to help you . this is hilarious .
she &apos;s also dating an astronaut .
wow . that &apos;s very impressive .
yeah . but leonard &apos;s impressive , too .
thank you .
&quot; befuddled . &quot;
the word i was looking for was &quot; befuddled . &quot;
knight to old woman ...
six @-@ and @-@ a @-@ third .
brilliant move .
thank you .
will the two of you excuse me ?
i need a hug .
sorry , i have company .
come on , sheldon , open the door .
i don &apos;t want to hug you .
i don &apos;t want to hug you , either .
i was just feeling blue .
blue , as in depressed .
well , not so much depressed as lonely .
i don &apos;t know what color lonely is .
what ?
red is angry ;
yellow is frightened ;
green is jealous ; and blue is depressed .
perhaps we can assign a color to lonely .
nothing rhymes with orange . it &apos;s probably lonely .
all right . come in .
you look positively orange with loneliness .
no , i don &apos;t see that catching on at all .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m working on my three @-@ person chess game .
oh , cool . can i play ?
it &apos;s three @-@ person chess .
did you bring a friend ?
no .
then as a mental exercise i invite you
to figure out why the two of us
can &apos;t play three @-@ person chess .
can you believe this guy ?
social protocol does , however ,
require me to bring you a hot beverage
in your time of need .
no , thank you . i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s not optional .
we &apos;re out of tea . i hope you like bouillon .
i , uh , i guess you &apos;re probably wondering
what &apos;s got me down .
actually , i was wondering
if i could add a third new chess piece .
how do you think people would feel about prince joey--
the king &apos;s feeble @-@ minded but well @-@ meaning cousin ?
i &apos;m going to be 30 years old ,
and i have no one in my life to love me .
i &apos;m such a basket case , i can &apos;t even talk to a woman
without having alcohol in my body .
the fun thing about prince joey
is every time he moves , there &apos;s a one @-@ in @-@ five chance
he &apos;ll kill himself .
sheldon , listen to me .
i have a big decision to make , and i &apos;m scared .
yellow . go ahead .
a friend at the school of pharmacology
gave me these new pills they &apos;re testing .
he says it &apos;s the next big thing
for social anxiety disorder .
fascinating . what &apos;s in it ?
i &apos;m not sure .
some sort of beta @-@ blocker attached to a molecule
extracted from the urine of cows .
i like cows .
that &apos;s not the point .
it was its own point . go on .
i &apos;m a scientist .
my ability to think is my bread and butter .
i &apos;m afraid if i take this , i might lose
that special , unique something
that makes me so successful in my field .
rajesh , i &apos;ve had the privilege
of working alongside you for many years .
my recommendation is that
you gobble these up like tic tacs .
okay , i &apos;m still trying to work this out .
how did penny meet an astronaut ?
i don &apos;t know .
the regular way people meet astronauts .
most of those guys live in texas .
obviously , this one doesn &apos;t .
okay .
leonard lives here . priya &apos;s from india .
people meet , howard . god !
fine .
you &apos;ve met lots of astronauts ,
and i &apos;ve never grilled you about that .
i &apos;d thank you to extend me the same courtesy .
i &apos;m not grilling you ; i was just curious .
i still can &apos;t get over the fact that she got a big movie part .
not that i care what my ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s up to , &apos; cause i don &apos;t .
maybe that &apos;s where she met the astronaut , all right ?
i &apos;m sorry . what would an astronaut be doing
working on a movie ?
he &apos;s a consultant .
i thought the movie was about 18th @-@ century vienna .
he can &apos;t have a hobby ? !
excuse me , i have to pee .
or is that implausible , as well ? !
it &apos;s nice to have another couple to hang with , isn &apos;t it ?
all right , guys , you have to go back .
i can &apos;t afford you .
no , don &apos;t send us away ; we love you .
i love you , too , but you cost more than my rent .
but , penny , you look so good in us .
damn it , the shoes are right .
good golly , penny , your whimsy is boundless .
what do you got for me , wildebeest ?
i think they &apos;re on to me .
the story &apos;s starting to fall apart .
calm down . everything &apos;s going to be okay .
we may have to kill her .
bernadette , i &apos;m putting you on speakerphone .
where are you now ?
in the bathroom .
oh , look at this ,
another one of our classic bathroom gabfests .
what &apos;s the problem ?
they &apos;re just asking me
all sorts of questions i can &apos;t answer .
just change the subject .
i suppose i could get them back to talking about leonard
going to india to meet priya &apos;s parents .
what ? !
they said something about going there this summer .
what , are they getting engaged ?
i don &apos;t know . i was too busy covering my heinie
on amy &apos;s stupid astronaut story !
what astronaut story ?
you texted me penny &apos;s dating an astronaut .
i texted &quot; architect . &quot; that &apos;s amusing .
auto @-@ correct must &apos;ve changed it .
yeah , it &apos;s hysterical .
all right , look , just forget about the astronaut .
architect . where would you have met an astronaut ?
look , just find out what &apos;s up with this trip to india .
i don &apos;t want to do this anymore !
don &apos;t you quit on us !
bernie , you okay ?
it was an architect !
thank you for coming with me , sheldon .
you &apos;re a good friend .
i &apos;m glad you think so .
that &apos;s what i strive to emulate .
okay , let &apos;s see if this drug works .
can i help you ?
forgive me for staring , but you &apos;re very beautiful .
thank you .
that &apos;s a great accent . where are you from ?
india .
oh , cool . i &apos;ve always wanted to go there .
it &apos;s a beautiful country . you &apos;d love it .
may i join you ?
uh , okay , sure . why not ?
my name is dr. rajesh koothrappali ,
and this is my friend dr. sheldon cooper .
there &apos;s no need to interact with me .
i &apos;m just here to observe .
what &apos;s he observing ?
we &apos;re scientists . we observe everything .
here , go buy yourself a scone .
all right .
and what is your name ?
angela .
oh , derived from the word &quot; angel . &quot; appropriate .
you &apos;re cute .
i &apos;d like to buy a scone .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , we &apos;re out .
we have muffins .
they sound delicious ,
but this money is earmarked for scones .
what are you doing ? !
oh , just getting comfortable .
so how long have you lived in los angeles ?
i ...
they were out of scones .
sheldon , i &apos;m talking to someone .
you &apos;re being rude .
i &apos;ll bet you &apos;re an actress .
if not , you should be .
you have a very expressive face .
oh , my god .
wait , where are you going ?
we were doing so well .
she never even got to see my penis .
who wants some more coffee ?
thanks , yeah .
sure .
let me help you .
nice to see that the gals are getting along .
&quot; gals &quot; ?
who are you , fred flintstone ?
this trip to india sounds fun .
yeah , i think it will be .
are you concerned your parents might not approve of leonard ?
a little .
they &apos;re very old @-@ fashioned .
well , i wouldn &apos;t worry about it .
it &apos;s not like you guys are getting engaged , right ?
oh , god , no . we &apos;re not there yet .
not engaged . very interesting .
i have to tinkle .
you &apos;ve been in there a lot tonight . are you okay ?
yes . are you writing a book ?
why are you getting upset ?
i &apos;m not upset . maybe you &apos;re upset .
what &apos;s up with you ?
bernadette ?
i can &apos;t do this anymore !
i &apos;m a good girl !
i went to catholic school !
okay , well , it &apos;s getting late .
this was terrific .
you win .
bernie ?
i think the word you &apos;re looking for is &quot; befuddled . &quot;
my catapult flings my bishop
to howard &apos;s queen &apos;s gorilla two .
nice .
okay , rook to transporter pad .
and he comes out at ...
... leonard &apos;s queen &apos;s bishop five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ third .
check on leonard .
hang on .
when is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart ?
when it &apos;s done charging .
or you land on the time machine .
obviously .
beekeeper to king 12 .
i capture your pope and release the swarm .
checkmate on sheldon .
i knew i should &apos;ve given my pope the jet pack .
