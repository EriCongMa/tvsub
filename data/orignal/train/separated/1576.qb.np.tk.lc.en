no , he &apos;s a musician too . classical .
well , maybe you &apos;re just a little too buttoned up .
dude , you gotta come jam with us sometime .
just think about it .
yeah , i know who you are .
you &apos;re robert quinn .
as soon as i saw you i knew .
you &apos;re my daughter . i brought you this .
just read it when you have the time .
dear callie , my name is sophia .
i &apos;m your sister . i would really , really like to meet you .
and i hope you wanna meet me too .
i &apos;m sorry . you were way better than her .
she only made the team because she &apos;s latin .
they have to have diversity .
no , i like how independent you are .
i just feel like sometimes
it &apos;s kinda like you &apos;re dating yourself .
like it doesn &apos;t even matter whether i &apos;m here or not .
well , congrats . it doesn &apos;t anymore .
emma , emma .
i know it &apos;s not true ,
but my dad won &apos;t let me sleep over at your house
because he thinks you &apos;re gay .
oh , i &apos;ve got some people
coming over to play in the garage again tonight .
is that still cool ?
yeah , of course . how &apos;s it going ?
good . we &apos;re still trying to find our rhythm .
what &apos;s the matter ?
nothing . the girls on the dance team .
they keep posted pics of them hanging out together without me .
how come they didn &apos;t invite me ?
maybe because you &apos;re e @-@ stalking them ?
i am not !
mariana , please ...
would you please help your siblings here ?
when do we get to hear something ?
uh ... i don &apos;t think inviting my moms to band practice
is the best idea this early in the creative process ,
but i &apos;ll let you know when the single drops ?
i see . you know what ? he doesn &apos;t think that we are cool enough .
i will have you know that your mother
and i used to listen to rock and roll all the time .
oh yeah ? like who ?
like springsteen and rem and ...
right .
bananarama .
i can &apos;t believe you just said that .
i &apos;ll have you know that i went to a nirvana concert , once .
so , why &apos;d you stop ? listening , i mean .
just ... remember we used to have dance parties all the time ?
i don &apos;t know . guess we just ... got busy .
so what &apos;s the deal with this weekend ?
are you guys still doing on your babymoon thing ?
actually , your grandmother had a shuffle in her conference plans
and she &apos;s not gonna be able to come and stay with you guys .
yeah , so , i think the babymoon &apos;s gonna have to wait .
what &apos;s a babymoon ?
it &apos;s kind of like a honeymoon
only instead of going away after you get married ,
you go away after you get pregnant .
before the baby comes and there &apos;s
no more time for fun , or travel , or romance .
um , i think you guys should go anyway .
we &apos;re old enough to stay alone for one night .
that &apos;s a very nice offer , sweetie , thank you .
but i don &apos;t think so .
you know , we could put brandon and callie in charge , honey .
we could ... uh , i don &apos;t ... um ...
i don &apos;t know that ...
honey , we need this .
it &apos;s just for one night .
* honey , drop the melodrama *
* tonight and do something crazy *
* all right *
* won &apos;t you come my way ? won &apos;t you come my way ? *
* all i see is your face ... *
what &apos;s going on ? lou , hold up .
uh , nothing , i &apos;m sorry .
i wonder if lou &apos;s coming on a little strong in the choruses .
i &apos;m sorry ?
well , it &apos;s just that we &apos;re all in mezzo forte in that section ,
and i was wondering if maybe you should just follow us ?
follow you ?
yeah ,
i mean , you don &apos;t wanna give it all away from the top , right ?
you gotta start with some pianos ...
pianos ?
yeah . piano means softly , plain .
gee , my favorite kind of rock and roll , soft and plain .
maybe he has a point , lou .
yeah , and maybe i know how to sing my songs . in my band .
ok , fine .
tomorrow night &apos;s open mic at groundspace .
i will put the word out to a few friends ,
and we can let them weigh in .
i actually can &apos;t do tomorrow night ,
my moms are out of town and i &apos;m kind of in charge .
ok , so we &apos;ll just do it here .
well , i can &apos;t just have people over .
shocker .
ok , yeah , sure . but only a few people .
you &apos;re the one in charge .
one , two , three , four ...
hey , wait up .
where you been ? i was looking for you at lunch .
is this about what my dad said ?
because , you know , i don &apos;t care if you &apos;re ... you know .
if that &apos;s what you are .
are you ?
what , gay ? you can say it ,
it &apos;s not a bad word .
but why do i have to be anything ?
what do you mean ?
why does everybody go around
labeling people all the time , putting us in boxes ?
i don &apos;t get it .
no , you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
i won &apos;t do that anymore .
and what about your dad ? he doesn &apos;t want us hanging out , right ?
he doesn &apos;t have to know .
yeah ...
i don &apos;t want to be anybody &apos;s secret .
tell your dad i said it was nice knowing ya .
演唱者 unwed teenage mothers

her name &apos;s sophia .
she is fourteen and she wants to meet me .
holy hell ...
what did jude think ?
haven &apos;t told him .
i don &apos;t know how he &apos;s gonna ... take it .
what about stef and lena ?
you tell them ? not yet .
well , how about i take your mind off of it tonight ?
you &apos;re sweet , um ... i can &apos;t .
i have to be home , like , right after school .
stef and lena are going away for the night ,
so they left me and brandon in charge .
can i come over ?
no guests allowed . i &apos;m sorry .
hey girls , change of plans ,
party at mariana &apos;s tonight !
awesome !
uh ... sorry .
where &apos;d you hear that mariana was throwing a party ?
from her .
let the babymoon begin .
what ?
uh , i don &apos;t know . just seems a little small , don &apos;t you think ?
doesn &apos;t feel a little claustrophobic to you ?
we should &apos;ve asked for the upgrade .
how much room do we need ?
all right , we should call the kids , i think .
honey , you just called them from the car .
what ...
the whole point of us being here is so we can unplug .
i &apos;m unplugged , i &apos;m unplugged .
no , no , no ! wait !
what ?
do you have any idea how expensive that is ? !
did you know that some hotels charge if you just open up the fridge .
seriously ?
how about i go to the grocery store that &apos;s just up the road
and i &apos;ll grab us some snacks and some water
i &apos;m sure that dana &apos;s gift didn &apos;t include incidentals
and we can &apos;t afford to splurge right now .
what ?
i guess this wouldn &apos;t be the best time to tell you
about the couples massage i ordered ?
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s fine .
sounds good . can i get you anything in particular ?
stef .
it &apos;s fine . i want to . i want to .
it &apos;ll give me a chance to call the kids .
and i &apos;ll get the little crackery thingys that you love .
just ... i &apos;ll be back before you know it .
you just ... you sit there and relax .
you told people we were having a party tonight ?
don &apos;t look at me ... it was brandon &apos;s idea .
what ? why would brandon be telling people we &apos;re having a party ?
ok , it &apos;s not a party . i &apos;m just inviting a few people over
to , you know , hear the band practice .
no . you heard moms . we &apos;re not supposed to have any people over .
hey , all i did was invite the dance girls .
who are inviting people , who are probably inviting people ...
well , that &apos;s not my fault .
i don &apos;t care who &apos;s fault it is ,
but you both have to call them all and cancel .
no . last i checked , i don &apos;t take orders from you .
well , stef and lena left me in charge .
so ...
no .
they left us both in charge .
exactly , which is why we should both ...
you know , it &apos;s our babymoon , too , you guys !
there &apos;s gonna be a baby .
which means this is the
last time our moms are ever go away again .
do you hear what i &apos;m saying ? ever . again .
which means that this is our only chance to have a party .
we &apos;re having a party ?
no !
come on , you guys , seriously .
you guys wanna get in more trouble ?
we only get in trouble if we get caught .
so , we don &apos;t get caught .
i &apos;m not gonna have any part of this .
stef and lena said that
nobody comes inside the house except for us .
so , nobody is going to step inside this house .
ok . we &apos;ll have the party in the backyard then .
fine . but if you get caught , that &apos;s on you .
jude and i are gonna follow the rules , right ?
fine .
ok .
who &apos;re you calling ?
uh , wyatt .
if we &apos;re going to be keeping people out of the house ,
we &apos;re gonna need help .
isn &apos;t that breaking the rules ?
no , it &apos;s ...
sometimes you gotta break the rules to keep them .
in that case , can i ask maddie to come ? you know , to help .
yes , we &apos;re fine , mom .
we actually just ordered some pizzas for dinner tonight .
so ... callie ?
oh , you know , she &apos;s , uh , holdin &apos; down the fort .
so while everyone &apos;s throwing down out there ,
we &apos;re just gonna hole up in here ?
yep . that &apos;s the plan .
gotcha . but if i were to step outside , you know ,
for a little bit , that would be ... ?
not cool . you &apos;re only here because you &apos;re my bouncer .
security . yeah , i didn &apos;t call you over so you could have fun .
yeah . no risk in that .
look , i &apos;m not taking any chances , ok ?
remember how destroyed
your house got after the foreclosure party ?
yeah , but that was kinda the point .
i feel like i just walked into the house that boring built .
you need something ? kinda busy .
uh , what are people supposed to do when they need to use the bathroom ?
guess that &apos;s your problem , isn &apos;t it ?
ok . so , people are just gonna
pee all over moms &apos; flowers , is that what you want ?
no . what i want is to prevent this house ... our house
from being , i don &apos;t know , vandalized .
vandalized ? don &apos;t you think you &apos;re over @-@ reacting a little bit ?
people get drunk and things get destroyed , brandon .
god , when did you become so anal ?
when did you become such an ass ?
ok , um ... a suggestion .
what if you let people use the bathroom just off the kitchen ?
i &apos;m just trying to help .
ok . but one at a time .
and we are going to monitor it all night .
we are ?
mm @-@ hmm .
it was your idea . or are we not trying to help anymore ?
fine . if that &apos;s how you guys want to spend your night .
sounds like a plan .
what ?
i &apos;ve never seen you two act like that before .
like what ?
brother and sister .
thanks for letting chelsea come .
my parents wouldn &apos;t let me come alone .
can i see your dog ? i love dogs .
oh . um , we don &apos;t have a dog .
callie thinks it &apos;ll keep people out of our moms &apos; bedroom ,
just in case they get inside the house .
so ... is connor coming ?
no . he &apos;s at his dad &apos;s for the weekend . why ?
do you like him ?
i don &apos;t .
shut up !
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m the only one
with a crush on someone in our class ...
oh , my god . i &apos;m gonna kill you . come on .
so , where you from ?
serbia .
ahh . nice .
how long have you been in this country ?
uh , about ten years .
yeah ? what made you come to america ?
you have family here ?
i did . but i came to start my own .
wow , that &apos;s very brave of you . do you have kids ?
yes , one . you ?
five .
this is the first night that they are staying home alone .
wow . so is this a girl &apos;s getaway from your husbands , then ?
uh , actually , we &apos;re a couple .
hence the couple &apos;s massage ?
nice .
hey , ladies !
what &apos;s with all the signs ? are we not allowed in the house ?
oh . we just had the floors redone , actually .
so , no one can walk on them .
besides , it &apos;s so nice out .
it &apos;s kinda chilly , actually .
are there , like , outdoor heaters or anything ?
no . but some of the seniors did bring beer .
so listen , hayley &apos;s douche of a boyfriend dumped her this afternoon ,
so she &apos;s super vulnerable right now .
oh , my god , that &apos;s terrible .
is there anything i can do ?
no . we just need to keep an eye on her .
make sure she doesn &apos;t drink too much .
we can &apos;t have her breaking the code of excellence tonight .
the code of what ?
right , i forgot .
since we haven &apos;t really hung out socially before ,
you should know , we have a few rules .
ok ...
we all stick to a one drink maximum .
we don &apos;t dress like sluts . we don &apos;t hook up with randoms .
and if there &apos;s dancing , we don &apos;t use any of our patent moves ,
those are exclusive to the team .
and if anybody breaks the code , they &apos;re kicked off .
but thanks for having us over !
hey , uh , where is she ?
you don &apos;t think she &apos;d , like , bail on us , do you ?
nah , it &apos;s just lou ... this is how she rolls . she &apos;ll be here .
hey , man . can i have a sip ?
what the ... ?
what &apos;s wrong with you ? !
get outta here . go .
yeah , toilet won &apos;t flush .
great . and thank you for telling us that after you used it .
you &apos;re welcome !
well , don &apos;t let anyone in . i &apos;m gonna go get a plunger .
hey . is jude here ?
um , upstairs . hurry . hurry !
see , this is why i didn &apos;t want anyone using the bathroom .
nope .
i take it back , that is why .
ok , that brings the count to two hand @-@ holds ,
three kisses , one butt @-@ grab ,
and one &quot; so deep it looked like he was gonna eat her head &quot; make out .
ok , i &apos;m bored . this is worse than when my dad watches golf .
oh . i don &apos;t know ... that ping pong game looked kinda funny .
well , maybe we should play a game , too .
i could be into that .
oh , uh , ok . i &apos;ll go check the game closet ?
what about ... spin the bottle ?
um ... we don &apos;t have a bottle .
there &apos;s an app for that .
well , there are only three of us .
what are you ... ?
i told my dad i wanted to come over .
and he said it was ok ?
i didn &apos;t ask him if it was ok .
so , you guys are having a party ?
we are ... now that there are four of us .
sorry . i didn &apos;t see anyone was in here .
have you seen a cooler anywhere ?
hey , are you ok ?
my boyfriend and i broke up .
seriously ? that sucks .
for what it &apos;s worth
my girlfriend just broke up with me too , so ...
i get it .
emma ?
well , that was dumb of her .
you &apos;re hot .
i could say the same about you .
so , why did this idiot break up with you ?
he said it &apos;s because i was too needy .
but , honestly ?
i think it &apos;s just because he wanted to hook up with older girls .
he &apos;s in college .
what about you ?
well , we weren &apos;t really a good match . so ...
i probably look like such a mess right now .
is my mascara running ?
a little .
will you get it ?
here .
uh , toilet &apos;s out of order .
what about our bathroom ?
no . no one goes upstairs .
what about if i like just pee in the kitchen sink ?
i mean ... sure ?
all right , fine . five minutes but just her , ok ? no one else .
hey ! no , no , no . take it outside !
ok , so you have to kiss whoever the bottle points to .
those are the rules . maddie , you &apos;re first .
are you ready ?
yeah .
ok , who &apos;s next ! jude ?
um , sure , just ... gimme two secs ?
oh ! sorry , i didn &apos;t know anyone was in here .
it &apos;s ok . you gotta go ? it &apos;s all yours .
what &apos;s ... going on ?
i don &apos;t think your friend &apos;s feeling very well .
hey ! off the swing !
it &apos;s not a playground !
where &apos;s kaitlyn ?
um ... she already came down .
you didn &apos;t see her ?
no .
hmm . that &apos;s weird .
wait here .
i like this ride !
yeah , well , ride &apos;s over .
come on , we gotta go downstairs .
aw , you &apos;re no fun .
yep . been hearing that all night . come on .
let &apos;s go .
ok .
wait .
what ?
wait , wait , wait .
no , no , no , no , no .
hey , they &apos;ve got lesbian porn .
how does breakfast on tiffany sound ?
that sounds horrifying .
oh , come on , it &apos;ll help get us in the mood .
please . no bigger turn off
than two straight girls in stilettos pretending for men ,
that they &apos;re hot for each other .
give me a break .
ok .
so how was your massage ? was it good ?
it was pretty good .
yeah ? cool .
how about you , how was your interview with inka ?
my what ?
you seemed more interested in her life story
than anything i &apos;ve had to say lately .
i was just making conversation .
during a couples massage ?
yeah , well , as soon as she heard we were
a couple &apos;a lesbians that shut her up , didn &apos;t it ?
where are you going ?
i &apos;m gonna take a bath .
i &apos;m so sorry . i had no idea how drunk she was .
just tell her friends that she came with to take her home .
i can &apos;t do that . none of the girls on the dance team
can see her like this , she can get kicked off the team .
why ?
because of the code .
code ?
yeah , the code . you &apos;re not allowed ...
actually , i don &apos;t care . just tell wyatt to take her home .
ok , come on .
i &apos;m looking for my son , connor .
are jude &apos;s parents even here ?
oh yeah , yeah . they &apos;re ... they &apos;re out back .
well , is connor here ?
you know , i don &apos;t know .
well , you mind letting me go take a look around ?
what &apos;s happening ?
stay .
connor &apos;s dad is here !
wait , why would connor &apos;s dad be here ?
connor &apos;s not here .
ok , connor , your turn .
we don &apos;t have to kiss , do we ?
well , those are the rules .
fine .
no , this is dumb .
we should stop .
no , it &apos;s cool .
let &apos;s just do it .
connor , your dad &apos;s here !
oh , my god , he cannot find me here .
why not ?
i snuck out .
i &apos;ve actually only been up here a couple of times ,
so i can &apos;t ...
where &apos;s connor ?
i don &apos;t know .
i thought he wasn &apos;t allowed to come over .
i &apos;m just hanging with my girls .
hey , where have you been ? this was your idea .
and in case you &apos;ve forgotten , i &apos;m risking my ass to do this .
cool it , beethoven . we &apos;ll start in a minute .
contrary to what you might think ,
you &apos;re not talented enough to make people wait .
really ?
well , contrary to what you might think ,
you &apos;re not a member of this band
and we don &apos;t need you or your big fat classical ego .
well , then why are we even doing this ?
you know what , we &apos;re not . peace .
ok . you need to get everybody out of the house now .
how am i supposed to do that , callie ?
i can &apos;t just ...
play .
ok . that &apos;s why they &apos;re all here , isn &apos;t it ?
so if you start playing they will come outside and listen .
well , lou just bailed , so i ...
so play without her , ok ? but play something ,
or i swear i &apos;ll call the police and shut this party down myself !
mind if i join you ?
listen , i thought about what you said and ...
you &apos;re right .
we should watch breakfast on tiffany .
you know what , i think ...
we should just go home .
all right , what &apos;s wrong ?
we need to connect .
i am trying .
no , you &apos;re not .
what do you want me to do ?
i want you to talk to me .
about something other than money or the kids .
why don &apos;t you talk to me ?
because half the time i really don &apos;t think you &apos;re listening .
so , when i don &apos;t talk , it &apos;s my fault .
and when you don &apos;t talk it &apos;s my fault , too .
i get it . it &apos;s all on me .
i &apos;m the one failing in this relationship .
i didn &apos;t say that .
well , that &apos;s how it feels .
ok , back downstairs . now !
go .
all right .
come on , let &apos;s go .
whatever . we &apos;ll party down ...
yeah .
hey , i thought you left .
that &apos;s what brandon said anyway .
brandon .
he always been such a pompous ass ?
you know , he acts like he &apos;s doing us some big frickin &apos; favor .
guess all these ...
ribbons and trophies have really gone to his head ?
brandon &apos;s not pompous .
so he &apos;s just an ass ?
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m surprised this didn &apos;t go to his head .
he was brilliant . like , really , majorly brilliant .
he even got into the junior symphony .
was brilliant ?
yeah , he ... got beaten up .
his hand was shattered and he lost all this .
he &apos;ll never play classical piano again ,
not like he used to .
brandon &apos;s not doing you a favor . you &apos;re doing him one .
hey , has anyone seen kaitlyn ?
anyone ?
sing something already !
dude , do you sing ?
i do , but ...
unless you want , like , a sonata , i kinda only know one song .
play it , we &apos;ll follow .

but you probably want to go home anyway ?
so we can just pack up ...
no , no , no , no , no , no .
no , look , they are obviously still alive , right ?
and if they &apos;re having a party ,
we will certainly find out about it soon enough .
in the meantime , why don &apos;t we have one of our own ?

kick off our shoes . oh , oh . just like that .
and we &apos;ll dance ... what ?
our son basically signed us up for aarp this morning .
so we can either roll with it , or we can dance .
come on .
so ? was it &quot; excellent , &quot; like you wanted ?
meh ... not really .
i spent the whole night cleaning up after everyone .
i felt like such a mom .
the dance girls ?
yeah . i just ... i don &apos;t get it .
kaitlyn made this huge deal about all these rules they had .
and then no one seemed to care
when they basically broke every single one of them .
and if i hadn &apos;t been babysitting them the whole night ,
i could &apos;ve actually had a good time .
maybe i could &apos;ve broken a rule or two myself .
that &apos;s a bad idea .
their rules , whatever they are ,
they still apply to you , because of who you are .
why , because i &apos;m latina ?
no , because you &apos;re not like those girls ,
and you never will be .
don &apos;t you know that ?
so connor snuck out , huh ?
well , his dad seemed pretty mad .
um . yeah , his ... dad doesn &apos;t really like me .
why not ?
what are we gonna tell moms ?
um , maybe a bird flew through the window ?
what , like a pterodactyl ?
no , they &apos;re gonna know that we had a party .
i could fix it .
i worked last summer in construction .
plating a window &apos;s not that hard .
all we gotta do is get the glass first @-@ thing in the morning .
then i can just pop it in and glaze it .
glaze it ?
i &apos;m not just a bouncer , you know .
how can i help ?
you got a broom and dustpan ?
so ... listen , i &apos;m sorry you had to be , like , the gestapo tonight .
i never should have ...
sucks being the responsible one .
yeah . tell me about it .
it was worth it , though .
getting to hear you play again .
that first song .
i know that &apos;s , like , ours .
the only reason i played it was because ...
because it &apos;s good .
and you knew they &apos;d love it . and they did .
you don &apos;t have to say that .
i know . brandon , you &apos;re really good .
and , with you , that band could really be something .
thanks .
for being such a good ...
sister .
they &apos;re here , everyone .
come on , they &apos;re here .
welcome back !
well , hey , what &apos;s going on ?
nothing . we all just wanted to be
here when you got home , that &apos;s all .
yeah , we missed you !
aw , we missed you too , munchkin .
lemme take this .
well , isn &apos;t that nice .
so how was it ? what &apos;d you do ? was it romantic ?
actually , it was .
we started ...
whoa , whoa , whoa . we don &apos;t wanna hear about it .
we haven &apos;t even said anything .
ok , so , what about you guys ? how was your night ?
uh , uneventful .
it was super mell ...
