i &apos;m home !
my dad was the least complicated guy on the planet .
his first order of business was to always be comfortable .
that meant parking his pants at the door .
his hobbies included sleeping in his chair ...
... watching &quot; fantasy island ... &quot;
oh , don &apos;t worry , boss .
... sleeping in his chair ...
... yelling at the phillies ...
what is that pitch ? !
... and sleeping in his chair .
even his parenting style was simple
and always involved choice vocab words .
hey , you morons . stop being morons .
unreal . i raised a moron .
why you got to be a moron all the time ?
he wasn &apos;t a complicated guy or , frankly , even that interesting .
but every once in a while ,
he was accidentally reveal something about himself
that would make you feel like you didn &apos;t know him at all .
all right , all fixed .
wow ! where did you learn how to do that ?
army .
what ? did you say &quot; army &quot; ?
dad , is this you and lou reed ?
yeah , we , uh , waited tables together .
what ? tell me more .
eh , it was a whole thing .
wait ! come back ! i want to know you !
pull up ! pull up !
you &apos;re gonna crash the plane .
i was in a plane crash once .
nap time .
yep , some people glorify the past ,
but not my dad .
to him , it &apos;s like it never even happened .
oh , my god , murray , you &apos;re not gonna believe it .
i just got off the phone with your old high school .
your record has been broken .
whoa , wait . dad had a record in high school ?
what kind of record ?
chili ! he loves chili .
it &apos;s something to do with chili .
true , but that &apos;s not it .
your dad set the record for most free throws in a row
at central high .
like , in basketball ? w @-@ what are you talking about ?
what can i say ? we won state .
uh , i hit 79 free throws in a row .
uh , what do you want from me ?
murray , the high school wants you to go back
so they can honor you at the game saturday night .
we get to stay downtown ,
and there &apos;s gonna be a banquet .
a banquet ? !
that &apos;s the fanciest of all food parties !
i know ! it &apos;s a very big deal .
here &apos;s the thing about that . pass .
no pass .
pass !
i already told them you &apos;d be there.- why would you do that ?
you know i don &apos;t have an interest in things .
is this for real ?
i mean , we &apos;ve never even seen you touch a basketball .
yeah , i mean , i can &apos;t believe this .
it &apos;s one of my dreams to play in the nba ,
and you never once mentioned it ?
didn &apos;t see how it was relevant .
oh , it &apos;s relevant .
what you gonna do ? what you gonna do ?
what you gonna do ? what you gonna do ?
not much more than what i &apos;m doing right now .
i want you to show me what you got , free @-@ throw king !
are we , uh , done here yet ?
no ! you were clearly some type of popular high school god .
tell me what it was like .
i don &apos;t know . i , uh , dated a lot of girls .
i went to parties .
i got elected class president a few times .
lunch lady gave me free jell @-@ o .
eh , the usual .
not usual . that &apos;s the opposite of my life .
the lunch lady said
i look like the warlord who burnt down her village .
i &apos;m going in .
no , wait , wait ! come on !
i thought you were gonna give me some pointers .
unless you want me to give you some .
how about from way downtown ?
hope you brought an umbrella ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s about to rain some 3s !
swish , baby !
fundamentals !
intangibles !
unselfish !
basketball !
and that &apos;s how you do it .
&apos;sup , lexy bloom ?
ready to break the seal on this new yearbook , or what ?
uh , sure .
this year , barry left an entire page blank
for the one signature he cared about --
his dream girl , lexy bloom .
&quot; have a bitchin &apos; summer , gustav &quot; ?
i &apos;m not the swedish exchange student !
i &apos;m speaking english to you !
swing and a miss .
aw , you love her , and she thinks you &apos;re from sweden .
i &apos;ve spent all year trying to make a name for myself ,
and lexy bloom still doesn &apos;t know who i am .
she &apos;s so lucky .
if only there was a way to , like , have a casual get @-@ together
with the coolest kids from school ,
like , at our house ,
but without the formal , sit @-@ down dinner .
i think you &apos;re describing a party .
oh , my god . i have the greatest idea .
i &apos;m gonna throw a party .
mom and dad are staying downtown saturday night .
i &apos;ll invite the whole school !
whoa , hold on .
uh , i want you to think about this -- - high @-@ school friends !
this saturday night ,
i &apos;m inviting you to the best party
in the history of william penn academy ,
thrown by yours truly !
we love you , gustav !
no ! i &apos;m barry goldberg !
doesn &apos;t matter ! party at my place !
for the next few days ,
barry spread the word all over school .
it was gonna be a wild rager ,
and nobody was more excited than me .
oh , man . my first high @-@ school party
with r @-@ rated language and adult situations .
this is my &quot; risky business . &quot;
damn right !
there &apos;s gonna be dancing , fistfights ,
pizzas on record players ,
hot cheerleaders jumping from the roof into the pool .
we don &apos;t have a pool .
don &apos;t we ?
blow this up .
sweet !
i &apos;m gonna go grab my inhaler and get started .
okay !
i got twister and ashtrays .
what time &apos;s this party kicking off ?
whoa , wait . you &apos;re okay with this ?
uh , look , i @-@ i don &apos;t condone lying to your parents ,
but i &apos;ve been tracking your highs and lows this year .
and frankly , you need this .
awesome !
only thing left is to make sure
mom and dad leave without suspecting a thing .
okay , love bugs .
pops is in charge while we &apos;re away for the evening .
have fun .
no fun here .
we &apos;re just gonna sit here bored to death
waiting for you to come home .
oh , well , in that case , throw on some shoes and join us !
i insist .
then it &apos;s settled . we &apos;re coming .
what are you doing ?
panicking .
okay , if the kids come with us , i &apos;m staying home .
great ! stay .
what &apos;s wrong with you ? !
the more the merrier .
you &apos;re a stupid , stupid boy .
y @-@ you two just go . i &apos;ll hold down the fort .
all right .
dinner &apos;s in the fridge .
that was a close one .
we make a good team , guys .
ladies and gentlemen ...
while barry couldn &apos;t wait to start his epic night ,
my dad was still indifferent about his ...
... captain of the 1961 state championship team
murray goldberg !
... until this happened .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s wrong with these people ?
nothing -- they love you , murray .
for my dad , the past was the past .
he never wanted to be
one of those guys always recounting his glory days .
but for one shining moment , he decided to embrace it .
let &apos;s go , beavers ! let &apos;s go !
chomp , chomp , chomp !
my dad hadn &apos;t picked up a basketball in years .
but by the end of the first half ,
he was ready to suit up .
that &apos;s how we do it , beavers !
yeah !
just want to take a quick moment
to welcome back murray goldberg .
in honor of his 25 @-@ year @-@ old record ,
we &apos;d like to present him
with a ball signed by the entire team .
murray , come on down .
hey , hot stuff !
thank you . thank you very much .
shoot the ball ! shoot the ball ! shoot the ball !
shoot the ball ! shoot the ball !
shoot the ball ! shoot the ball !
really ? what are you doing ?
shoot the ball ! shoot the ball !
that &apos;s my husband !
the moment my dad stepped to that line ,
he realized he was still that kid from high school --
an athlete , a legend , a champion .
and then , he did this .
got it !
you suck , old man !
in his defense , that was a very common shooting style
back in the day .
but as the chant of &quot; air ball &quot; rang through the gym ,
it only confirmed to my dad
that he didn &apos;t belong on that court .
he belonged in front of the tv in his underpants .
but this wasn &apos;t the most embarrassing display of the evening .
that belonged to my brother &apos;s epic party .
it was 9 : 00,
and the only people that showed up were me ,
roger mcfadden , who brought bugles ,
and gustav , the foreign @-@ exchange student .
later . i &apos;m going out .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
look -- look what &apos;s happening in there .
it &apos;s a pure sausage fest .
the bugles are for hot chicks only !
you &apos;re a popular girl . invite some of your friends over .
the poor guy needs this .
shut up , gustav !
it &apos;s called being fashionably late .
fine . i &apos;ll call a couple of my friends .
thank you .
nowadays , all it would take is a tweet .
but back then , one phone call worked just as well .
i thought you said &quot; a couple of friends . &quot;
all i did was call lainey .
you wanted barry to have fun , right ?
look at the guy . he is the man .
welcome to casa de barry , ladies !
looking good . nice pants , random dude .
told you i &apos;d rock .
is the party like a rap video , or what ?
move over , aunt rose &apos;s 50th .
this is the hottest party this dining room &apos;s ever seen .
holy crap . it &apos;s lexy bloom .
she came !
she &apos;s here !
what are you waiting for , man ?
chiclet me .
whoa , girl .
i see you found the v.i.p. section .
what makes this the v.i.p. section ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m here .
anything you want , i &apos;ll make it happen .
fruit roll @-@ ups ? bagel bites ?
flintstone vitamins ?
the world &apos;s your oyster , baby .
see ?
we just gave your weird little brother
the best night of his life .
whoo ! the party has arrived !
you go to school with him ?
i do not .
and we &apos;re out of hand .
who wants to take a shower ?
by 10 : 00 , barry &apos;s party was blowing up ...
but not as much as my sister .
hey ! stop ! you &apos;re spilling everywhere !
you !
stop making out in my dad &apos;s chair !
he lives there !
what the hell ? ! that &apos;s my mom &apos;s !
why are you wearing that ?
oh , it &apos;s a sweater party .
that &apos;s not a thing .
and i put a sign on the stairs that said &quot; off limits . &quot;
ah , yeah , that piece of yarn broke ,
so we all just kind of ... helped ourselves .
&quot; we &quot; ?
off ! everyone take it off !
yes ! it &apos;s happening ! take it off !
adam , go upstairs !
well , the sign says it &apos;s off limits .
the yarn is broken . upstairs .
i said &quot; upstairs &quot; !
okay . this is officially nuts .
you need to put an end to this .
me ? ! you &apos;re the adult !
i &apos;m the cool grandpa . i can &apos;t be the bummer .
you be the bummer .
uh , there &apos;s a pizza on the record player .
it &apos;s bad for the needle .
you people are disgusting !
what the hell are you doing ? !
it &apos;s a sweater party .
that &apos;s not a thing !
stop encouraging this . you need to shut it down .
shut it down ?
no way ! this is my party .
and i say we rage on until the crack of dawn ! !
yeah !
well , i say we each pick up one piece of trash and leave !
boo !
smile all you want . that &apos;s it .
i &apos;m calling the hotel where mom and dad are staying .
i see what this is .
you &apos;re jealous
&apos;cause i &apos;ve thrown the greatest party of all time .
look around . it &apos;s not your party .
these are all my friends .
yo , ari .
whose party is this ?
erica &apos;s throwing a going @-@ away party for the swedish dude .
it doesn &apos;t matter . lexy bloom &apos;s here .
she came to see me .
oh , did she ?
barry , wait .
i didn &apos;t mean to --
that did not go well .
no , it did not .
why are you so mad at me ?
i saw the look on your face .
you were thrilled to be back out there on that court .
you know why i don &apos;t talk about the past ?
i &apos;m gonna tell you .
because it was great .
i was class president . i was a basketball star .
i was a hero .
and now i &apos;m just none of those things .
have you ever tried shooting the ball this way ?
it was a very common shooting style !
turns out , my dad wasn &apos;t the only one kicking himself .
barry &apos;s big chance
to become a legend and win over lexy bloom
had literally been kissed goodbye .
what &apos;s shaking , gustav ?
i wish i was gustav .
except for that weird fish lunch he always brings .
so , why you out here , missing your own party ?
well , it has come to my attention
that this is erica &apos;s party ,
and i &apos;m just a big , giant , invisible bag of suck .
oh , come on . you &apos;re not invisible .
you &apos;re barry goldberg , the guy who freaked out
on the lunch lady because they ran out of pudding .
why is that the only thing anyone ever remembers about me ?
hey , they promised pudding . they had no pudding .
it was a dark day .
look , i know you feel like this year was a bust ,
but you did a ton of cool stuff --
karate in the talent show .
you &apos;re on the wrestling team .
you did that rap video
about stone cold groovin &apos; on a ferris wheel .
you like my rap ?
it &apos;s hilarious .
wait , that &apos;s what you were going for , right ?
yeah !
how do you know so much stuff about me ?
your sister &apos;s my best friend .
i &apos;ve known you my whole life ,
and i can honestly say there &apos;s ...
no one like you .
thanks .
who knew my sister &apos;s wild , bad @-@ influence best friend
would be the one to remind my brother that he was special
in his own bizarre , barry kind of way ?
now stop pouting
and come show erica &apos;s friends whose party it really is .
for the first time in ages ,
things were looking up for my big bro .
it didn &apos;t last long .
oh , god !
oh , balls !
everybody try and clean up a little bit !
i @-@ i &apos;m going to bed ! everyone , run !
as barry watched my parents get out of that car ,
he knew there was only one thing to do --
freak out .
mom ! dad !
why are you home ?
you &apos;re supposed to be at the hotel !
there was a banquet ! who skips a banquet ? !
a party ? !
i don &apos;t even like my own kids ,
let alone a house full of other people &apos;s !
murray ! oh , my god . they &apos;re wearing my sweaters !
no ! those aren &apos;t yours !
it &apos;s a look that &apos;s happening ! watch mtv !
yeah , i &apos;m sure all the young boys
are wearing leopard sweaters .
hey ! that &apos;s my leopard !
okay , fine . clearly , you &apos;re gonna kill me , and --
yes ! yes , i am !
do it , murray . do it with your hands .
just hear me out , please .
i &apos;m nothing like you , dad .
i don &apos;t dominate in high school .
i don &apos;t hold sports records .
people only know me &apos; cause i get angry at pudding .
listen , you &apos;ve had your glory days ,
and they sounded awesome .
but this , in there ,
this is the best i &apos;m ever gonna do .
oh , boopie . that &apos;s so sad .
but you are in so much trouble .
but ... aww .
i &apos;m begging you . this is my moment .
all i &apos;m asking for
is seven more hours of nonstop partying .
absolutely not .
you got 10 minutes .
seriously ?
yeah , but do me a favor .
make this a night you &apos;ll always remember .
you are the greatest father on this planet .
as my brother desperately sprinted off
for his 10 minutes of glory ,
my dad realized he could still be a hero
to someone who actually mattered .
awful parenting choice .
just awful .
you &apos;ve seen him run . he needs this .
this was it -- barry &apos;s year was coming to a close ,
and it all came down to 10 magical minutes .
he knew there was only one way to leave his mark .
that was on the dance floor .
he may have been a far cry from michael jackson .
but in that moment , he sure felt like him .
it wasn &apos;t just barry &apos;s enthusiasm
that brought the crowd together .
it was his giant &apos; 80s boom box
blasting out the anthem of our youth .
and it sounded like this .
oh , we &apos;re halfway there
whoa , livin &apos; on a prayer
take my hand
we &apos;ll make it , i swear
whoa , livin &apos; on a prayer
who is that guy ?
that &apos;s barry goldbg . this is his party .
dude , lexy bloom &apos;s looking over here .
what do i do ?
i &apos;m gonna help you out . you ready to make her jealous ?
make her what ?
what are you doing ?
ow ! i don &apos;t know ! what are you doing ?
this is the greatest night of my life !
times up ! get the hell out of my house !
and leave my sweaters !
naturally , my brother was grounded for the entire summer .
and you get to take all my sweaters to the dry cleaners .
but sometimes ,
those magic moments are worth it .
i &apos;m very upset . you have a lot of nerve , young man .
it was a night he &apos;d carry with him forever ,
a night no one could take away .
for one brief moment ,
barry goldberg was a legend .
y @-@ you want to hear about , uh , how i met lou reed ?
uh , yeah .
okay . it was 1965 ...
sure , my dad would always be the kind of guy
who loved his tv and his la @-@ z @-@ boy .
but after that fateful night ,
he found it easier to open up a bit more .
swish , baby !
okay , by my count ,
you &apos;ve missed the last 22 shots .
just do it my way once .
fine .
swish , baby !
new shooting style !
and , even crazier ,
barry got my dad , the free @-@ throw king ...
... back on the court for some actual pointers .
intangibles !
it didn &apos;t help much .
oh , honey .
you &apos;re delicious no matter how bad you are .
oh , damn it , barry !
when it comes to my childhood ,
i may not always remember ...
... exactly when something happened ,
or exactly who was there .
but i do know that it was 1980 @-@ something
and it was awesome .
stop videotaping ! get out ! mom !
stop ! i swear ...
death blow . death blow .
you &apos;re aggravating me , you little bastard !
he &apos;s aggravating me , the little bastard !
why are you hitting yourself , huh ?
what did your face ever do to you ?
open up .
no ! no ! no ! no ! no !
no . no . no . no .
my god . this house is going nuts .
this house is going nuts .
i am optimus prime ,
and i am a good guy , and i will kick your butt !
who &apos;s there ?
get dressed now !
get dressed now .
and this is it .
aah ! that hurt ! aah !
whoa , what a night .
what &apos;s up ? you got any o.j. ?
i &apos;m sorry , what the hell are you doing here ?
ah , i passed out in the basement during the party .
take off my sweater and get out .
what &apos;s in it for me ?
nothing . it &apos;s my sweater .
fine .
show me your boobs .
no !
then give me $ 1 million .
no .
i &apos;d very much like to revisit the boob conversation .
i feel like we &apos;ve done this once before .
did it end in boobs ?
no .
tell me something .
when was the last time you had a balanced breakfast ?
every day .
protein from beef jerky , energy from frosting .
sweetie , sit down . i &apos;m gonna make you some food .
you &apos;re gonna eat it .
then you &apos;re gonna take off my sweater and get the hell out .
morning , barry .
