who wants the last dumpling ?
ooh , me !
penny , a moment .
we just had thai food .
in that culture , the last morsel is called
the &quot; greng jai &quot; piece , and it is reserved for
the most important and valued member of the group .
thank you all for this high honor .
i &apos;ve seen pictures of your mother , keep eating .
all right , honey , if we &apos;re gonna make the movie , we should go .
this may be hard for you to hear ,
but when i say &quot; honey , &quot; i mean my fiance .
yeah , well , now it means her .
it &apos;s okay if he wants to come .
fine . but next time , we get a sitter .
all right , i got to go to work .
i &apos;ll walk down with you .
wait .
which is closer to the new train store in monrovia ,
the movie theater or the cheesecake factory ?
neither of them are close .
oh , well , then i guess it doesn &apos;t matter
which one of you drives me .
let &apos;s play a fun guessing game
to see who gets to take me .
all right , this four @-@ letter word describes either
a printer &apos;s type size or a compulsion to eat dirt .
okay , i &apos;m not driving him .
penny , don &apos;t give up , you can get this .
aren &apos;t you going with sheldon ?
no , i have no interest in model trains ,
stores that sell them , nor their heartbreaking clientele .
well , i have some work to do , so ...
i can &apos;t imagine that would disturb me .
carry on .
okay .
wouldn &apos;t you be more comfortable at home ?
not really , no .
all righty then .
guess i &apos;ll just get started .
leonard , please . i don &apos;t need the running commentary .
amy ?
yo .
you okay ?
oh , sure .
i thought you were reading .
i was .
now i &apos;m thinking about what i read .
you all right , leonard ?
you seem very uncomfortable .
i @-@ i &apos;m fine .
should i go ?
i &apos;ve been told sometimes i overstay my welcome .
wha ... who told you that ?
well , most recently my gynecologist .
well , you stay as long as you &apos;d like .
i &apos;m glad to hear you say that ,
because i &apos;m having a wonderful time .
i said the same thing to my gynecologist .
what are you going to get at the train store , sheldon ?
oh , i &apos;m not buying anything .
they &apos;re having a lecture .
&quot; h @-@ o gauge railroading .
half the size of o @-@ gauge , but twice the fun . &quot;
very controversial topic .
which side do you come down on ?
i &apos;ll let you know after tonight .
unlike some people , i &apos;m going in with an open mind .
who am i kidding ?
of course we all know it &apos;s o @-@ gauge or no gauge .
can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains ?
that &apos;s pretty big talk for a man
with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother &apos;s house .
first of all , they &apos;re not tricks , they &apos;re illusions .
and ...
secondly , when we get married , they &apos;re all going up
in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes .
why would i keep clothes at your mother &apos;s house ?
well , don &apos;t think of it that way .
once we move in , it &apos;ll be our house .
is she moving out ?
why would she move out ?
it &apos;s her house .
hang on .
you seriously think i &apos;m going to live with your mother ?
howard , i think i can help here .
yes , bernadette , that &apos;s exactly what he thinks .
why not ?
it &apos;s a great house , plenty of room ,
and if we have kids , mom &apos;s there to help .
you know , when she tells &quot; the three little pigs &quot; story ,
she actually has hair on her chinny @-@ chin @-@ chin .
i &apos;m not gonna live with your mother .
not now , not ever .
wow , someone obviously has some mommy issues .
raj , take me home .
don &apos;t listen to her . go to the movie theater .
take me home now .
movie theater !
okay , everybody calm down .
there is a simple solution here .
raj , take me to the train store ,
and then i don &apos;t care what you people do .
how was your shower ?
it was good , good .
just out of curiosity , what time do you usually go to bed ?
oh , i &apos;m up all night .
i &apos;m like a possum .
boy , you were not liked in high school , were you ?
not really .
is that my yearbook ?
&quot; dear leonard , you &apos;re really good at science .
maybe one day you &apos;ll come up
with a cure for being a dork . &quot;
well , it wasn &apos;t spray @-@ painting a lightning bolt
on my briefcase , i can tell you that .
if it makes you feel any better ,
the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother .
&quot; dear amy ,
self @-@ respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun .
love , mom . &quot;
well , you can add jerry &apos;s junction
to the list of train stores
sheldon cooper will never set foot in again .
rough night , casey jones ?
you don &apos;t know the half of it .
it was billed as a lively give @-@ and @-@ take
on the merits of model train sizes .
but it was actually a setup to intimidate
weak @-@ minded spineless rubes into buying h @-@ o starter sets .
what &apos;s in the bag ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
but it &apos;s not a spine , i &apos;ll tell you that .
well , i had a delightful evening , leonard .
we should do this again sometime .
ah , sure . that &apos;d be nice .
glad to hear it .
i need someone to accompany me to the wedding
of dr. moranelli and dr. gustufson this friday .
they &apos;re kind of the brad and angelina
of the primatology department .
wouldn &apos;t you rather bring sheldon ?
i would , but the last wedding we went to was a disaster .
he behaved like a child the entire time .
not my fault .
you said there &apos;d be other scientists there my age .
doesn &apos;t matter . you &apos;re out , he &apos;s in .
no date to the prom ,
two dates to a wedding .
hmm , how times change .
ha @-@ ha , you have to go to a wedding .
i &apos;ll get it !
could you get it ? !
i just said i &apos;m getting it !
fine , i &apos;ll get it !
i got it !
i don &apos;t want to fight .
i was just surprised when you sprung
the whole living @-@ with @-@ your @-@ mom stuff on me .
yeah , well , i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t run it by you first .
i don &apos;t know who you &apos;re talking to ,
but in or out !
we don &apos;t need bugs !
the bugs only come here
because you &apos;re their queen !
listen , how about this .
before we make any kind of decision
about where we live , we have a trial run .
stay here for a weekend , see what it &apos;s like .
and your mom would be okay with that ?
sure she would .
ma , do you mind if bernadette stays here this weekend ? !
hey , if she &apos;s willing to give the milk away for free ,
who am i to say no ? !
see ? she &apos;s good with it .
frankly , after all your sleepovers
with the little brown boy , a girl is a big relief !
all these years , i &apos;ve been so wrong .
the tinier the train , the more concentrated the fun .
you &apos;re a brain scientist .
can you explain to me why a brilliant man
likes playing with toy trains ?
not without cutting his head open , no .
how about making my eyes like cleopatra ?
really ? for a wedding ?
perhaps you &apos;re right .
my cheekbones and beckoning pelvis
already have a certain &quot; hello sailor &quot; quality to them .
ready .
so handsome .
like james bond .
he &apos;s better than james bond , because he &apos;s tinier .
i got you this to give to me .
oh , sweetie , guests don &apos;t normally
wear corsages to a wedding .
that &apos;s more of a prom thing .
i never went to my prom .
my mom paid my cousin to take me ,
but he just used the money to buy drugs .
put the corsage on her .
amy , this is for you .
when you &apos;re done copping a feel , that goes on my wrist .
all aboard !
it &apos;s official .
i &apos;m an h @-@ o trainiac .
so , dinner went nice .
yeah . yeah , i guess .
does your mother always cut your meat for you ?
only when it &apos;s fatty .
well , don &apos;t be jealous , babe .
someday you &apos;ll get to cut it for me .
bernadette !
i found the extra head for the waterpik if you want to use it !
i &apos;m okay , mrs. wolowitz .
you sure ? !
i just squirted half a brisket outta my teeth !
hey , ma , how about a little privacy ? !
oh , i know what that means !
hubba @-@ hubba !
oh , god .
relax , it &apos;ll be fine .
okay .
let me know when you &apos;re done canoodling !
mommy needs a foot rub !
would you like to dance ?
no , thank you .
i &apos;m really not much of a dancer .
you &apos;re not exactly winning any trophies
as a conversationalist , either .
i &apos;m sorry .
the bride and groom seem happy .
why shouldn &apos;t they be ?
they have a feverish night of
socially @-@ approved copulation ahead of them .
in some cultures , we &apos;d stand outside of their bedroom
cheering as they achieved orgasm .
that sounds like a late night ,
and i have work in the morning , so ...
leonard , you may not have noticed ,
but i am being a delight here .
and you &apos;re not holding up your end of the evening .
oh , sorry . this wedding just reminds me
of my kinda @-@ sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away .
i have a kinda @-@ sorta boyfriend who &apos;s playing with a model train right now ,
you don &apos;t hear me bitching about it .
leonard , a word of advice-- moody self @-@ obsession
is only attractive in men who can play guitar
and are considerably taller than you .
i &apos;m not moody .
i &apos;m fun .
you have any evidence to support that statement ?
well , hey , i &apos;m just as much fun as you are .
really ? are you willing to draw a mustache on your finger
as a conversational icebreaker ?
i am .
okay , fine , what do you suggest ?
we just had a lovely meal ,
the band ... is on fire ...
and you &apos;re sitting next to a beautiful woman
wearing whorish makeup .
why don &apos;t we head out on the dance floor
and see if i can sweat through these dress shields .
once again , i @-@ i &apos;m really not much of a dancer .
don &apos;t worry ...
i &apos;ll lead .
( &quot; the chicken dance &quot; playing )
howard ?
ready for bed ?
no . i need to brush my teeth , but your mother &apos;s
been in the bathroom for , like , an hour . oh .
yeah , she sometimes has problems doing her business . hang on .
ma , give up !
tonight &apos;s not your night !
you don &apos;t know that ! i just sat down !
come on , take a break !
bernadette needs to brush her teeth !
she can come in and brush her teeth !
i &apos;m not embarrassed !
problem solved .
no , it &apos;s not . i &apos;m not going in there .
oh , come on , honey .
she &apos;s just sitting in there reading a magazine .
you can &apos;t see anything .
i go in all the time .
ha ! the eagle has landed !
and we have splashdown .
wait here , i &apos;m gonna go light a candle .
and then we make passionate love .
there we go , last floor .
i just can &apos;t figure out what happened .
i put my left leg in , i took my left leg out ,
i put my left leg in , and something just snapped .
the hokey pokey is a young man &apos;s game .
i did have a great time .
thank you for reminding me
it &apos;s okay to have fun once in a while .
you &apos;re welcome .
and also for breaking the head off the ice swan
so i could hold it against my pulled groin .
i excel at spatial reasoning ,
and i had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck
would cradle your genitals nicely .
well , okay . again , thank you .
and again , you &apos;re welcome .
want to come in , have a cup of tea ?
no , thanks . i &apos;m gonna head home .
&apos;kay . well , good night .
good night .
ames , hi . how was the wedding ?
great . until i accidentally made leonard fall in love with me .
come in , let &apos;s talk .
do you want a glass of wine ?
wine is one of the reasons i &apos;m in this fix .
that and this dang pelvis .
okay , i &apos;m sorry , what exactly happened ?
the inevitable--
he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend ,
while i was charming , supportive
and , let &apos;s face it , in this dress ,
the perfect combination of madonna and whore .
oh , god , did he make a move on you ?
no , but it &apos;s only a matter of time .
how could i have not seen this coming ?
now i &apos;m gonna have to break the little sad sack &apos;s heart .
yeah , i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be okay .
oh , penny , much as i would treasure knowing that
the two of us had been defiled by the same man ,
leonard just doesn &apos;t get my motor running .
so , um , what are you gonna do ?
do you want me to talk to leonard , let him down easy ?
no . i &apos;ll let him have tonight .
then in the morning ,
i &apos;ll send him an e @-@ mail letting him know
this body is never gonna be his wonderland .
i mean , frankly , you &apos;ve got a better shot than he does .
leonard .
check it out .
i bought an n @-@ gauge locomotive .
half the size of h @-@ o.
look , it fits in my mouth .
sounds like you had a &lt; i &gt; great &lt; / i &gt; night .
i did .
how was yours ?
not bad .
i had a lot more fun with amy than i thought i would .
what exactly do you mean by that ?
well , it turns out she really knows
how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time .
although , truth be told , my groin &apos;s a little worse for wear .
why did you do that ?
to send a message : she is not for you .
what ?
not for you !
good morning , handsome .
morning , mom .
it &apos;s me .
yes , it is , and you &apos;re so pretty in the morning .
your mom and i made you breakfast .
so you guys are getting along ?
yeah , i guess .
we &apos;re very different people , howard ,
so communication &apos;s a little tricky .
does he like the pancakes ? !
he didn &apos;t try them yet !
is there any butter ?
it &apos;s butter @-@ flavored syrup .
so , what &apos;s the word ? !
he wants butter !
it &apos;s butter @-@ flavored syrup !
i just told him that !
i don &apos;t need any butter .
if you want butter , i &apos;ll get you butter .
