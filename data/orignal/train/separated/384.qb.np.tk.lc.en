over 68 million americans
leave the safety of our borders every year .
if danger strikes ,
the fbi &apos;s international response team
is called into action .
&quot; let the world change you ,
and you change the world . &quot;
what is that , gandhi ?
che guevara .
definitely not gandhi .
i guess that makes sense , considering we &apos;re in cuba .
i &apos;m rodrigo .
cuban ?
no , from miami .
i &apos;m natalie .
mind if i join ?
what are we drinking to ?
how about getting myself back to havana in one piece tonight ?
cheers .
havana &apos;s easy .
just make a left at the end of the block
and follow the signs to circuito norte road .
you know your way around .
cuba &apos;s my home .
you needed a ride , you should have asked .
i didn &apos;t know when you were leaving .
do you mind ?
not at all .
hey , buddy .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m not a cab .
he &apos;s with me .
cuba &apos;s like a time capsule .
i think i &apos;ve wanted to go there half my life .
it is the ultimate geographic tease ,
only 90 miles from the coast , yet totally out of reach .
never snuck in through mexico ?
took a flight from canada ?
ah , that would be illegal , so no .
not even for a cigar ? you &apos;re missing out .
there really is a difference .
how would you even know ?
the last time i checked the embargo , it &apos;s still on .
hey , i got a guy .
all right , i talked to mateo cruz earlier ,
and he wanted to remind us that this is the first time
the u.s. and cuban authorities will be formally cooperating
since the cuban revolution .
the white house has made it clear
that working with the cubans on this is a priority .
so , the i.r.t. is setting precedent on this one ?
yes . however , despite the softening
of our relationship with the cuban government ,
i want to remind everyone that cuba has been a police state
for the past 50 years .
things don &apos;t change that quickly .
both the military and the police
have been used to absolute control .
i don &apos;t know how they &apos;ll react to us arriving in country ,
so i want everyone to be cautious and careful
in our approach to working with them .
and add to that , the fact that technology
is at least 50 years behind .
there &apos;s no ibis ,
no codis ,
and telecommunications are spotty at best .
yeah , the only consistent cell service
is in havana or close to a town ,
and it &apos;s incredibly slow , and nothing &apos;s secure .
well , good thing i brought those sat phones .
hola , mis compadres .
now , i wish i had more info ,
but our ambassador tells me that the cuban police
are being stingy with the details .
now , of course , he is a diplomat ,
so he didn &apos;t say the word &quot; stingy . &quot;
he said that they were &quot; diligently working on it . &quot;
our embassy in havana is still under construction ,
so we &apos;re to report to the havana police department
as soon as we land and defer to the cubans in all areas .
where &apos;s the ambassador ?
working out of a hotel room in havana .
he &apos;ll come to us if he needs to .
so , our victim , rodrigo fernandez , 27,
a cuban @-@ american chef from miami ,
was found shot to death on circuito norte road
outside the town of camajuaní
about three hours outside of havana .
now , rodrigo rented a car which is now missing
and presumed stolen .
what kind of a car ?
a 1956 chevy with a peugeot engine .
ah , a frankenstein .
a what ?
it &apos;s the original hybrid .
it has the body of a classic american car ,
only with an updated engine .
it &apos;s considered to be one
of cuba &apos;s biggest natural resources .
owners are waiting for the embargo to drop
so they can sell them to american collectors
and make a huge fortune .
and this natural resource may have been too tempting .
maybe we &apos;re dealing with a simple carjacking .
i &apos;m assuming there &apos;s no lo @-@ jack or gps in the car ?
your assumption is correct .
so , our unsub is on the move
in a country that can &apos;t keep up .
hola .
hola .
can i see that ?
claro .
gracias .
why do you have that flag ?
america is good .
no .
with america , there is no future .
第一季 第十一集
&quot; beautiful in the midst is misery ,
capable of loving in the face of afflictions and trails ,
man finds his greatess , his fullest measure ,
only in the kindom of this world . &quot;
alejo carpentier
totalitarian governments always have
the coziest police departments , don &apos;t you think ?
now , i just got off the phone with rodrigo &apos;s brother ,
danny fernandez .
he &apos;s a cop down in miami .
rodrigo arrived in havana three days ago .
now , his brother tells me he was in camajuní .
to visit his grandparents &apos; graves .
and as a cuban @-@ american ,
he may have felt like he already fit in .
would have given him a false sense of security .
and that made him an easier target .
hello .
and welcome to cuba .
capitán cedro pena ,
and i have good news .
the case is solved .
we found who killed the american .
that was quick .
the suspect was driving the american &apos;s car .
we caught him at his job ,
and he &apos;s already confessed to the murder .
he will be dealt with by the end of the week .
by dealt with , you mean ?
the firing squad .
i &apos;d like to speak with the accused .
why ? you think we made a mistake ?
just 10 minutes .
look , we &apos;d like to do everything by the book , you understand .
if we don &apos;t ,
rodrigo &apos;s family may keep asking questions .
they could go to the press ,
and that would be very embarrassing
for both our countries .
my men are holding him nearby . i will take you to them .
i &apos;d also like to send my team to the crime scene
and to the morgue to examine rodrigo &apos;s body .
i will arrange for your escorts .
waste your time .
habla inglés ?
sí .
good , sit down . sit down .
what &apos;s your name ?
javier .
is that what your mother calls you ?
no , she call me boo and owl .
because of the glasses ?
yes .
who cares about his nickname ?
he needs to establish javier &apos;s baseline
so he can see what he looks like when he &apos;s telling the truth .
that way when the questions change ,
agent garrett will be able to tell if he &apos;s lying .
so , you like baseball ?
of course , i &apos;m cuban .
why did you kill rodrigo fernandez ?
i didn &apos;t ! i mean , i kill ...
still think he did the crime ?
maybe he &apos;s a good liar .
actually , he &apos;s a very bad liar .
javier , let me tell you what i think happened .
you &apos;re headed here to work when , somehow ,
you come upon a nice car . i don &apos;t know where .
maybe it &apos;s on the side of the road , and nobody &apos;s in it .
a car like that is worth a lot of money ,
so i can see how you seeing it just sitting there ,
you may have taken it .
yes , yes . that is what happened .
i found the car , and the keys were in it .
there was no gas , but i filled it up and drove away .
you didn &apos;t notice the blood inside ?
i tried to clean it up .
i just wanted the car .
‭ now he &apos;s telling the truth .
it resonates with his baseline emotional status ,
just like when he was talking about his nickname .
he took the car , but that &apos;s all .
this is nonsense . he confessed .
mr. pena ,
i believe that he felt compelled to admit to the crime .
you think i beat him ?
there &apos;s no evidence of that .
i just believe that he &apos;s innocent .
capitán , we just believe there &apos;s more to the case .
that &apos;s all .
and we &apos;d like your help to figure it out .
do you like that car ? &apos; 57 edsel .
yeah , it &apos;s pretty nice .
yes , americans like our cars .
they like that they &apos;re old .
but i like newer cars
like a 1970 dodge charger .
you mean like vin diesel ?
ride or die .
i didn &apos;t know &quot; the fast and the furious &quot;
made it all the way to cuba .
yes , my cousin sends me dvds from florida .
all right , so this is where rodrigo &apos;s body was found , right ?
yes , right here .
okay .
if these walls could talk .
i bet they &apos;re listening .
should we go back to the jet ?
no , the point is to work with the cubans on this ,
even if they don &apos;t want to .
or if they &apos;re too afraid to .
cuban government likes to keep a close eye on everybody ,
including the police .
everybody &apos;s terrified of the military .
true .
the police are scary enough .
they didn &apos;t even have to beat javier into a confession .
just the threat of bringing him in was enough .
at least cedro &apos;s trying .
he already turned over the crime @-@ scene photos
and rodrigo &apos;s personal effects .
simmons . yeah ?
yeah , the road is packed with hitchhikers .
i &apos;m thinking that &apos;s how our unsub might have made contact .
rodrigo may have given his killer a ride .
hitchhiking is state sanctioned in cuba .
rodrigo may have wanted to seem helpful .
more like a native .
the cuban cop i &apos;m with said he did a canvass ,
and nobody saw anything .
that &apos;s not surprising .
cuban people aren &apos;t fond of talking to cuban cops .
try it again , this time alone .
got it .
it &apos;s a little early , huh ?
it was found on rodrigo &apos;s body .
mezcal .
that &apos;s unusual , considering this is rum country .
that could be something .
if this did belong to rodrigo ,
why wouldn &apos;t the unsub just have left it in the car ,
tossed it outside ?
this bottle looks like it was displayed .
rodrigo &apos;s crime scene was staged .
but why ?
blood looks to be at least 24 hours old ,
the keys are still in the ignition , it &apos;s out of gas .
the same was rodrigo &apos;s chevy .
if the blood is 24 hours old ,
whatever happened to the fairlane
happened before rodrigo was killed .
my man , alejandro , he ran the plates .
it &apos;s a rental car , but it was rented out of santiago de cuba .
that &apos;s on the other end of the island .
get down there and find out who rented it
and what happened to them .
based on the amount of blood ,
we may be looking at another murder .
i &apos;m on it .
there &apos;s another body in a bodega in tarafa
near camajuaní where rodrigo was found .
three bodies .
i told him not to go .
you knew it was dangerous , and you went ,
and you bought him a ticket , anyway .
cuba has changed , even the u.s. government thinks so .
her mother wanted rodrigo to go .
she told me right before she died .
you shouldn &apos;t have listened .
look , i know this is hard ,
but i need to ask you about rodrigo .
is he the type to pick up a hitchhiker ?
no .
he was always the quiet type ,
not into chatting with strangers .
unless she was a pretty girl .
no matter what he was doing , if he liked a girl ,
he &apos;d take the time .
it &apos;s not like he was a creep or anything .
it &apos;s just , girls loved him .
is that what you think happened , a hitchhiker ?
we &apos;re not sure yet .
i should be down there .
mr. fernandez ,
the situation is complicated enough .
we &apos;re figuring out the best way to work with the cubans
for the first time in a long time ,
so please ,
just trust my team to do their job .
looks like a .45 , same as rodrigo .
i think the same person did both crimes .
it &apos;s the same caliber weapon .
both bodies were posed ,
and camajuní , where rodrigo was found ,
is just down the road .
only this man was killed less than eight hours ago ,
while javier was in custody .
i &apos;ll see to his release .
well , the first thing i noticed
was the american flag stuffed in his mouth .
dust void
where the flag was hanging before the unsub took it off .
look at the bloody smudges .
notice the feathering on the edges ?
lip marks , bloody kisses ?
the unsub wet their fingers in the blood ,
used it as lipstick , and kissed him on the face .
more messages , taunts .
why no mezcal bottle this time ?
i don &apos;t know ... yet .
look at this .
&quot; bless your heart . &quot;
our unsub speaks english .
&quot; bless your heart &quot; is not just english .
it &apos;s an american idiom .
our unsub is american .
my country &apos; tis of thee .
sweet land of liberty .
of thee i sing .
land where my fathers died .
preliminary findings for rodrigo fernandez ,
c.o.d. is pretty clear .
bullet trashed his pulmonary artery .
i found a pool of blood in the lap area of his pants .
suggests rodrigo was shot when he was sitting down
and bled out before he was dumped .
right .
and the entry wound makes me think
that the shooter was sitting right next to him .
so , he did pick up a hitchhiker ?
that &apos;s a good bet .
the only odd thing is the angle of the wound track .
rodrigo was twisting to the right when he was shot ,
like he was looking behind him .
i would be looking at the person with the gun .
maybe there was something scarier behind him .
like someone else .
rodrigo &apos;s family told monty that he &apos;d only be inclined
to pick up a female hitchhiker ,
so what if he did that ,
but then somebody else joined in the backseat ?
he turns around to see a man ,
but the woman shoots him instead ?
so , we &apos;re looking for two unsubs ?
both american ?
i &apos;m not sure .
yeah ?
i just left santiago de cuba ,
and i found out who rented your fairlane .
an american named victor foster .
you were right , jack .
he &apos;s dead .
the police found him 36 hours ago .
he was shot in the head and left by the side of the road .
the local cops are e @-@ mailing you the crime @-@ scene photos .
another dead american .
how come we didn &apos;t know about this ?
well , victor &apos;s an ex @-@ pat
who &apos;d been living in venezuela for years .
he works for an energy company .
he was in cuba on business .
his wife never contacted anybody in the states .
victor , rodrigo .
seems like our unsubs are targeting americans .
no , the clerk in tarafa was cuban .
but had an american flag hanging on his wall ,
which the unsub shoved into his mouth .
right , possibly suggesting the clerk
should eat his love of america .
well , it would explain why &quot; bless your heart &quot;
was left at the last crime scene .
it &apos;s an idiom from the american south
where politeness is paramount ,
which can lead to colloquial phrases
with double meanings .
&quot; bless your heart &quot; is a prime example .
it can be loving .
or patronizing .
the unsubs could be suggesting that the clerk
was stupid or naive for supporting the u.s.
so , we have two unsubs ,
at least one of whom is american
targeting americans and american sympathizers in cuba .
why ?
was there anything else missing from victor &apos;s body ?
money ?
yeah , victor had a license to carry a gun --
.45 , nowhere to be found .
they got the gun .
okay , so let &apos;s run this out .
36 hours ago ,
our unsubs shot victor in santiago de cuba .
they dumped his body , stole his fairlane and his gun .
yeah , then they drove down to camajuaní ,
where they ran out of gas .
unsubs were targeting rodrigo
because he was an american ,
and they needed his chevy .
so , they killed rodrigo and dumped his body
and kept going to tarafa .
they ran out of gas and abandoned the chevy .
right . and that &apos;s where cedro &apos;s first suspect , javier ,
picked it up .
so , our unsubs are moving across cuba
from the southeast to the northwest .
yeah , they &apos;re moving fast .
cuba &apos;s 700 miles long .
they covered almost two @-@ thirds
of it in the past 36 hours .
we need to tell cedro to set up roadblocks .
we have spree killers on our hands .
so , this is victor foster .
another message .
yeah , that freaked the cops out .
green apple .
santiago , camajuaní , tarafa ,
crushed worm , bloody lips .
that -- that apple is not green .
it &apos;s unripe .
we believe we have two killers -- one male , one female .
unknown subjects , unsubs , as we call them ,
who &apos;ve been leaving signatures at the crime scenes .
a signature is a ritual
not necessary to the crime ,
but something the unsub does for emotional satisfaction .
and we believe that the signatures the unsubs
have left at the crime scenes
point to famous quotes from che guevara .
for example , &quot; revolutions don &apos;t just drop like an apple .
sometimes they need to be forced . &quot;
that &apos;s the unripe apple
that was found forced into victor &apos;s mouth .
and that mezcal bottle ,
it didn &apos;t belong to rodrigo .
it belonged to the unsubs .
in fact , it had nothing to do with the mezcal .
it was the crushed worm left inside it .
as che said regarding the cuban revolution , &quot; in fact ,
if christ himself stood in my way ,
i likely , che ,
would not hesitate to squish him like a worm . &quot;
the bloody kisses on the clerk &apos;s face ,
that could be about one of che &apos;s most famous quotes ,
&quot; at the risk of seeming ridiculous ,
let me say that the true revolutionary
is guided by a great feeling of love . &quot;
and all of the crime scenes have taken a very specific route
from santiago to camajuaní to tarafa .
they &apos;re following che &apos;s revolutionary road .
the path he took when he liberated cuba .
yes , the unsubs most likely see themselves
as revolutionaries in their own right .
using che &apos;s words , following his journey .
it only validates their actions .
che @-@ related signatures combined with a narrow timeframe
suggests that we &apos;re dealing with ideologically driven
spree killers .
cubans are doing this ?
no , we believe they &apos;re americans .
can you i.d. them ?
not yet .
over 50,000 americans have entered cuba
since it became legal .
and that &apos;s only through official channels .
based on the fact that they target americans
or american sympathizers ,
we believe that the unsubs &apos; connection to che
is because of his anti @-@ american rhetoric .
and if our theory is correct ,
the unsubs are gonna end up in santa clara .
where che won the revolution .
with a massacre .
i will alert the authorities in santa clara .
mae , call simmons .
tell him to meet us there .
yeah .
why would americans do this ?
kill people and pretend to be che ?
that &apos;s hard to say .
che is perceived differently
by different people around the world .
yeah , he &apos;s a hero to the cuban government ,
saving cuba from
the capitalistic batista regime .
and to the american hipsters wearing a t @-@ shirt ,
he &apos;s a symbol of general rebellion , &quot; say no to the man . &quot;
a hero to the oppressed .
that &apos;s one of the great propaganda campaigns of all time .
turning castro &apos;s thug into a hero ,
the man responsible for torturing and killing thousands
of innocent civilians under the cover of the revolution .
cubans are still terrified to speak out against him .
the butcher of la cabaña .
and our unsub &apos;s inspiration .
we need to find &apos; em . now .
&quot; there are two adversaries ,
this tiny champion of the caribbean
and the immense imperialist hyena . &quot;
babe , you need sleep .
sleep ? no . there &apos;s no time for sleep .
i just th--
no , no ,
you think this is a joke , don &apos;t you ?
don &apos;t you ?
just get out .
get out !
i &apos;m not going anywhere !
it &apos;s always been you and me , nat ,
and it always will be .
you want me gone ?
you make me gone .
don &apos;t go .
please .
don &apos;t go .
don &apos;t .
don &apos;t go .
&quot; one has to go grow hard
but without ever losing tenderness . &quot;
the santa clara police are expecting us .
you can all ride with me .
sir , this is jack garrett from the fbi .
this is general gabriela nestor díaz .
good to meet you .
&quot; the revolution begins . &quot;
where did you get this ?
it was delivered to &quot; granma . &quot;
the state @-@ run newspaper .
the captions are in spanish .
the suspects are trying to communicate with the cubans .
they want the newspaper to publish the photos .
they &apos;re looking for a wider audience for their message .
no , these americans will never receive the glory
they seek by mocking che .
these unsubs are killing to draw attention .
it &apos;s hysteria .
sir , the americans --
your team is to go back to your plane .
when we catch the american killers , we will let you know .
&quot; many call me an adventurer ,
and that i am only one of a different sort .
one of those who ... &quot;
... &quot; risks his skin
to prove his platitudes . &quot;
just one picture , come on ,
it &apos;s friggin &apos; che .
yeah , i know .
what &apos;s the problem , man ? you don &apos;t like communists ?
god , how american .
no , i don &apos;t like narcissistic psychopaths .
this is one part of the tour i wish we &apos;d skipped .
come on , let &apos;s get a mojito .
&quot; if you tremble with indignation at every injustice ,
then you are a comrade of mine . &quot;
mr. ambassador .
i was told that you and your team
would be working with the cubans ,
not antagonizing them .
i &apos;m not antagonizing them .
i &apos;m working this case the way i &apos;d work any other .
the police are interested in our help , i can tell .
yes , but the military is not happy .
which isn &apos;t surprising ,
considering the history between our two countries .
i expected this , didn &apos;t you ?
i need you to tread carefully .
and i need to do my job ,
but instead , i &apos;m standing here
while two killers are on the loose .
the cuban government feels your loyalties are split ,
that you &apos;re using che &apos;s legacy
to deflect attention from the fact that the unsubs are american
so you can protect them .
did you tell them they were wrong ?
yes ?
got it .
there &apos;s another victim in santa clara .
díaz wants to talk with you .
that place must have been wired .
the military show up right after we discover the che connection ?
this government is used to absolute control ,
so right now ,
it &apos;s all about protecting che &apos;s image .
even more than solving the crime .
hey , man .
hola , simmons .
this is for you .
it came off the photo from the american killer .
we don &apos;t have a database with american fingerprints ,
but you do .
does cedro know about this ?
it was his idea .
ride or die ... partner .
what will the killers do now ?
is my team back on the case ?
i see no reason for that .
hey , guys . good news .
i got a hit on that fingerprint .
natalie knox , 25,
from mobile , alabama .
she worked at a children &apos;s daycare center ,
so they kept her fingerprints on file .
she &apos;s traveling with nick jamison ,
26 , also from mobile .
when did they arrive in cuba ?
so far , no official record of that .
could have come in before the border opened .
what do we know about them ?
nick jamison was raised by his father .
his mother abandoned both of them when he was 5 .
according to school records ,
he started acting out shortly after .
diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder by age 10 .
surprising he hasn &apos;t been arrested before this .
yeah . according to his d @-@ plus average ,
it &apos;s surprising he graduated from high school .
but he did , and that &apos;s where he met natalie sophomore year .
they &apos;ve been together a while .
looks like natalie didn &apos;t have the greatest life , either .
mother was in and out of jail for drug use ,
and she was married three times --
her third husband was a prison guard .
yeah , according to a police report ,
natalie accused him of raping her when she was 9 .
her mother says that natalie was lying ,
and the case was dropped .
both nick and natalie have been
taking care of themselves since they were children .
explains why they &apos;re so close .
they &apos;ve been fulfilling each other &apos;s paternal / maternal roles .
anything to suggest that either of them considers
themselves a revolutionary or anti @-@ capitalist ?
not really .
they &apos;ve been struggling financially ,
living hand to mouth .
she was a bartender in the states ,
and he was a mechanic .
why cuba ?
well , it &apos;s cheaper .
no creditors , that &apos;d be attractive to them .
no , it could be a more direct connection to that .
i spoke to natalie &apos;s mother
who said that she had a cuban neighbor named nona gutierrez .
now , natalie and nona were close ,
and she used to talk about how much she missed cuba .
why did nona move to the states ?
according to her asylum application ,
both her parents were killed by the batista regime in 1954 .
well , if the batista regime killed her parents ,
she would see che as a hero .
and if she imprinted that on natalie ,
that would explain her skewed perception of che --
seeing him as a protector of the cuban people .
hey , jack .
we &apos;re back in action .
so , we can leave the jet ?
the latest killing changed nestor &apos;s mind .
that and cedro .
what &apos;d he say ?
that we all needed to work together .
because if we didn &apos;t ,
the families of the victims may go to the american press ,
and that could be embarrassing for both our countries .
cedro &apos;s a quick study .
pick you up in 5 .
we did a canvass , pero --
yeah , we didn &apos;t find much .
the victim is austin morrison , american .
he was here with a british friend , simon kotner .
they were down here at the tomb earlier .
they came here looking for a bar .
simon never saw the shooter .
makes sense , considering austin was shot in the back .
not like our other victims .
right , and there were no obvious
che related messages on the body .
that suggests they &apos;re devolving , abandoning their signature .
it could be bloodlust taking over .
well , if the dynamic is shifting between the two of them ,
we &apos;re probably looking at an unequal pairing ,
where one is dominant , and one is submissive .
and the dom decided it &apos;s time for the sub to kill .
that would explain the attack from behind .
the sub is either afraid or not fully committed .
maybe they &apos;re not doing it for the same reason .
nothing on the radio . nobody .
nobody is listening .
propaganda is vital .
it is the heart of our struggle .
why won &apos;t you listen ? !
nat , stop !
i told you .
i told you what he was doing .
why didn &apos;t you listen ?
baby , it &apos;s me .
why doesn &apos;t anyone ever hear me ?
let &apos;s give &apos; em something they can &apos;t ignore .
well , you were right .
i have nick and natalie entering cuba illegally
via mexico two years ago .
now , six months ago ,
they renounced their american citizenship .
they consider themselves cuban .
ah , but there is more .
i got a hit on a flagged american passport .
stan williams missed his return flight
from havana to dallas four days ago .
he was found beaten half to death
in an alley in havana .
did he contact u.s. or cuban authorities
about the attack ?
neither , but a witness did give a detailed description
to the cuban police .
it seems that a white male attacked stan first ,
then a woman joined in .
she was yelling at him in english .
it could be nick and natalie .
based on the chronology , this could have been
their first attempt at attacking an american .
he may only be alive because they didn &apos;t have the gun yet .
mae , go see if he can talk .
if he can i.d. nick and natalie ,
we may have our first real witness .
and what brought you to cuba ?
my buddy was having a 30th birthday party .
and do you have any idea why these two attacked you ?
people are nuts .
so , they just approached you and started hitting you ?
all i remember is the guy , then i must have blacked out .
did they want anything ?
money ?
so , what happened ?
it &apos;s fuzzy . i &apos;d been drinking .
stan , what are you not telling me ?
you &apos;re deflecting my questions ,
and you have been vague in all of your answers .
it was the girl .
what was her name , natalie ?
she was the bartender .
she was coming onto me to get a bigger tip .
that &apos;s all -- a tease .
they make you think that they want it ,
but when we make a move --
come on .
did you rape her , stan ?
nick saw you ?
is that what happened ?
i &apos;m gonna kill you ! i &apos;m gonna kill you !
kill you ! let go of me !
let go ! let go ! let go !
natalie was trying to make a life for herself ,
escape the situation back home .
she thought she &apos;d be safe here .
until she was raped by an american .
she conflated stan &apos;s aggression
onto that of her american stepfather .
and the trauma pushed her into a disassociative state .
she &apos;s suffering from ptsd .
she &apos;s turning every american she meets into a surrogate .
killing them to release her rage .
while using che &apos;s trail
as a message to the cuban people --
a warning against americans .
so natalie is the dominant one .
so , nick &apos;s just going along with it ?
i know he &apos;s unstable , but there &apos;s no evidence
to suggest that he was a cold @-@ blooded killer before .
i think natalie &apos;s rape
was pivotal to him , as well .
her psychotic and emotional breakdown
would feel like an abandonment to him .
the american killers have been busy .
where were these sent ?
state @-@ run newspapers and television stations .
specificity of time , the amount of pictures .
she &apos;s escalating .
she &apos;s frustrated .
her photos aren &apos;t being published .
it &apos;s taking her back to when nobody
would listen to her about her stepfather &apos;s abuse .
where did che go after the revolution ?
la cabaña , the prison .
since santa clara ,
all the che monuments have been on lockdown ,
so showing up there now would be like suicide .
yeah , but natalie doesn &apos;t want to die .
she just wants to be heard .
and the cuban press is ignoring her .
where is the foreign press stationed in cuba ?
well , there &apos;s no official office for them ,
but they usually spend their evenings at the bar
at the hotel nacional ,
looking for stories .
natalie &apos;s about to give them one .
you ready , natalie ?
that place may be where the press hangs out ,
but it &apos;s also filled with tourists .
they could be planning a massacre .
we may have a better chance of appealing to nick , the sub .
we &apos;re heading into a fluid situation .
nick may not have been a killer before ,
but he &apos;ll do anything for natalie .
you move , you die !
so , we got press in here , right ? !
right ? !
start recording .
natalie wants protection and action from nick .
yeah , but now that nick has killed for her ,
she may cede control to him .
as che said ,
&quot; while envisioning the destruction of imperialism ,
it is necessary to identify its head . &quot;
listen to her .
&quot; its head , which is no other
than the united states of america . &quot;
che warned you ,
and your country , our country , let them back in .
and look what they did to me !
look what they did to me !
natalie knox !
i &apos;m jack garrett with the fbi .
the fbi ?
that &apos;s right .
i &apos;m here to tell you that we &apos;re listening .
all of us .
god , they &apos;re listening .
they heard us !
we did it , nicky .
we did it .
they &apos;re listening .
we did it !
natalie ? no one &apos;s gonna hurt you again .
damn right , including you !
nick , i know you love her ,
so save her and save yourself and drop the gun .
maybe he &apos;s right .
natalie , are you kidding ?
he &apos;s the cops .
they &apos;re gonna take you away from me .
baby , we &apos;ve killed people .
we had to make them listen .
you have , natalie .
we all believe you .
shut up !
stop talking to her !
natalie , look at me . baby , look at me .
look at me . look at me .
it &apos;s always been you and me , baby .
always , and it always will be .
it &apos;s over , nick .
i &apos;m tired , nicky .
i &apos;m so tired .
put down the gun !
&quot; we must not let these harsh times
destroy the warmth in our hearts . &quot;
nick , don &apos;t !
stan williams is being indicted
for the rape of natalie knox .
good .
he &apos;s asking to be extradited .
well , he can ask .
is this how all american law enforcement get around ?
well , only when you cross international datelines .
thank you for your help , all of you .
it was our pleasure .
it &apos;s an invitation to join the fbi national academy
should you like to .
it &apos;s a 10 @-@ week intensive held at quantico .
it teaches our profiling techniques
to law @-@ enforcement officers all around the world .
we &apos;d be honored if you joined .
i will see you in virginia .
