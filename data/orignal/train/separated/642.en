Let's get down to business,
provided I can be sure you're an ally.
An intriguing offer.
You've got a deal.
What's going on?
Jack. I'm sorry.
I'm taking you home to L.A., okay?
My lawyer sent over our business contract.
Why does this say that you plan to own 70% of the company?
Any other investor would ask for much more.
Maybe I should find out for myself.
I know someone who can help you.
Who?
My brother.
My father is grooming me
to take over the Lemarchal Empire.
We'll make a great team, Daniel.
This table is the last thing my father and I worked on.
"Oscar Chapman."
Who is that?
Chapman worked for Lemarchal Media in '93.
Died in a car accident.
Another dead end.
Hey, Nolan. What?
Oscar Chapman faked his own death.
Then we better pray we can find him.
And they're off!
Victory can never be achieved alone.
Allegiances must be forged to overcome superior forces --
some born from a shared goal,
others out of desperate need.
But for a union to succeed,
one must determine if an ally is truly a friend...
...or merely an enemy in disguise.
You came.
I'm surprised.
As was I when I received your invitation.
It's been a while since we last spoke.
I was beginning to think you lost interest in what I had to say.
I always want to hear the thoughts of beautiful women.
Especially ones with secrets on the Graysons.
Conrad's landed some impressive blows against you.
I assume you want me to help clip his wings?
You said you possess leverage on him?
I'll pay a lot for it.
Well, it's an attractive offer,
considering my current financial state.
But surely you have other avenues you can pursue.
None with your access.
Well, that's funny,
seeing as your new partner was married to him for over 20 years.
Which means you're playing me.
Tell Victoria, "Nice try."
Hmm, what do you know, I won.
I'm past security
and almost at the Lemarchal records room.
I trust your meeting with Pascal was fruitful.
As I suspected, Victoria is using him to spy on me.
While you used him for our own purpose.
The plans were right.
The most secure rooms in the Lemarchal building
are activated by Pascal's print.
Well, then, I've got what you need.
发送
Nolan's program just finished lifting it.
I'm transmitting now.
I'm in.
Let's just hope there's something in here
that proves Oscar Chapman is alive.
Javier!
Wake up!
Checking to see if I snuck out?
I said I wouldn't.
No. I trust you.
But can we just talk about what happened the other day?
Come on, pal.
I think I've earned five minutes.
Okay.
We'll talk later.
That was a close one.
Do you think he knows I'm here?
And what's he gonna do?
Ground me?
Well, he's obviously trying to guilt you into signing with him.
You still want me to go with your brother, don't you?
Look, I told you.
Even if I am pissed at Nolan, I can't do that.
It would crush him.
Daniel can make things happen that Nolan can't.
Well, I sort of have my eye on a different Grayson.
And she has hers on
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you.
Hey, just talk to him.
And trust me.
If it's that important to you, okay.
Set it up.
So, I'm reeling this kid in...
It's only a matter of time before I close him.
What exactly does this mystery program do
that is so valuable?
Well, Charlotte got me a copy. Here,
see for yourself.
It's an aggregate of your digital footprint.
Basically, it analyzes all your online habits,
so it can direct anyone to your likes, needs, and desires.
What?
I'm not joking.
Ask yourself something. Test it.
Uh, okay.
Okay, Margaux,
what shoes do I want this season?
Jerome C. Rousseau gold animal peep toe pumps.
Oh, my god. She's right.
Of course she is. She's you.
Hey, that Javier is a genius.
Are you sure you want to bring this to my father?
Look. We want to work together, right?
But your father's not gonna let me
as long as my last name's Grayson.
Unless, you bring him something like this.
And a deal like this
changes us from spectators...
to owners.
Well, hello, there, Victoria.
Emily, what an unpleasant surprise.
I highly doubt that, considering the little chat
that you arranged between me and your new paramour.
Oh, I see that your imagination is as vivid as ever.
I would love to stay and chat,
but I have less boring people to talk to.
What the hell are you doing here?
You agreed to stay away.
Relax. This isn't about you.
I'm in town to receive the Green American Award
for my innovation in green technology.
I'm surprised you didn't know.
You used to be so plugged in.
Look at you, trying to prove
you're not the same pathetic lapdog
who followed Conrad around the office.
What do you think these people would think
if they knew how the Great Luke Gilliam acquired his wealth?
You're really gonna bring that up?
Pull yourself together, Victoria.
You were just as responsible for what happened.
Don't pretend otherwise.
It was supposed to be you, not David.
Well, unlike him, I didn't let Conrad stab me in the back.
He tried to frame me the second he got in over his head,
but I was happy he did it,
because at that moment, I learned the greatest lesson of all --
screw the other guy.
Careful, Luke,
or your return to the Hamptons just might be your downfall.
I'd hate to meet that threat,
with the evidence I've been holding onto all these years.
Use it!
Nothing would make me happier
than to see you and Conrad take each other down.
You need to learn to let the past go.
After all, we got away with it, scot-free.
His name is Luke Gilliam.
He was Grayson Global's biggest earner.
Rumor was he illegally manipulated energy markets,
which Conrad used to inflate profits.
That made him the logical choice
to take the fall for laundering terrorist money.
I mean, he was certainly an easier sell than your father.
When that plan failed, the Graysons had no choice.
But I don't understand how you missed Gilliam before.
My father never wrote about him in his journals.
He quit before the company was tied to the bombing.
So, he just took his cut and ran?
He used his payout to start a natural gas company.
He's in town to accept an award for his...
environmentally safe techniques.
You have your doubts.
It's more than that.
He has evidence about Fight 197,
and I'm going to get it from him.
What about you?
Did you find anything in Oscar Chapman's personnel file?
No, no. Nothing -- well, nothing concrete.
He grew up in New York,
was transferred to London around the time of the bombing.
If Mason was right and Oscar faked his own death,
then he may have returned home to hide.
I wish I could help you.
You stay focused.
Get that evidence.
You're gonna need this later.
We want bigger. We have to wow him.
And masculine colors -- red, orange, blue.
Nothing too soft.
Oh, I got nothing for you.
Jack! You're back!
Yeah. I flew in this morning.
Thanks.
It's pretty crazy around here.
Yeah. I'm just about to close a very big deal with Daniel.
Did you have a good time in L.A.?
Well, it wasn't really that kind of trip.
My mom was dealing with some pretty heavy stuff.
Oh, sure.
No, I'm sorry.
Margaux, can you look at this?
Excuse us. Excuse us.
Margaux...
I get that what you're working on is really important.
But...
I was gone for over a week, and we didn't talk once.
What's going on?
My father asked me to take over his business.
Not just "Voulez" -- all of it.
Well, we clearly have a lot of stuff to catch up on.
We need to make time for each other, Margaux.
How about tonight? Hmm?
I get a sitter, we turn off our phones,
and we try to get back on the same page.
Uh, yes.
Yes. But tonight is impossible.
I promise, once the deal is done,
I'm all yours.
Your hydrangeas are dead.
Time was you cared for them
like they were gifts from Chloris herself.
And you've never shown any interest in botany.
So what do you really want, Conrad?
Well, Hamptons gossip is buzzing
about your confrontation with Luke Gilliam.
We're divorced,
and you forfeited any right to question my actions.
Oh, you're right.
I'm merely here to protect my interests.
I paid Luke handsomely for his silence.
And I'd hate for you to
derail that armistice with your irrational behavior.
I couldn't be happier to leave all that behind
now that I have true happiness on the horizon.
With Pascal?
I regret to inform you that your latest romantic facade
isn't built on a foundation of honesty and trust.
Why don't you ask him about his role in the conspiracy
that doomed your beloved David Clarke.
Going somewhere?
My parole officer called.
Probably wants to know
why I haven't found gainful employment.
Maybe you could come with, huh? Explain why?
Why don't we just clear the air?
We couldn't make a deal. It's fine.
You got to where you are by looking out for your own interests.
No, I got to where I am because someone believed in me.
Oh, you mean David Clarke, the terrorist.
You know what, despite what the rest of the world thinks,
he was a great man.
Do you know something that I don't?
Yeah, smartass, I do.
He saw in me what I see in you...
angry hacker,
chip on his shoulder.
You have got the brilliance,
but you also have the potential to go down the wrong path.
You mean like letting a terrorist bankroll you?
That's what they called me when we first met.
I got to go. Just...
...think about what I said.
Yeah. I will.
Nolan's got a lead on chapman. I'm off to the city to meet him now.
How long will you be?
Why?
Do you need help on your end?
Nah, don't worry.
I'll figure something out.
I hope you find what you're looking for.
Okay. Bye.
Hey, you're back.
Yeah.
Is this a bad time?
No. Not at all. Come on in.
How's Stevie?
The Graysons really hurt her.
Jack, I'm so sorry.
I know.
I guess that's why I came.
I needed to see someone who gets it.
So, this is your new target?
Yes.
Luke gilliam.
He runs a clean gas company, but it's a sham.
The chemicals he uses are toxic.
They get into the water, poison the ground.
And let me guess ...
his wells don't end up in towns like the Hamptons.
And these people don't have the means to fight back.
This guy has been untouchable.
He has evidence of Conrad's role in the bombing.
I'm meeting with him tomorrow.
So, getting to this guy
will help you take down the graysons?
Yeah.
You know, maybe there's something that you could do to help.
Really?
Look, you know I don't like you involved in any of this ...
But I am,
especially after what happened to my mom.
I'm all in.
Let's do this.
Why exactly am I waiting here?
You can't have a stakeout without takeout.
Do you have a lead on Oscar Chapman or not?
What? Chapman lives there?
No. But a woman named Brenda Evans does.
She emptied out Oscar Chapman's bank account
with a bunch of fake I.D.S 20 years ago.
So, either this woman stole from chapman,
or she's working with him.
Exactly.
Which makes her
our best bet at finding him.
Why the Aiden Face? This is good news.
I thought things were better after your trip home.
Well, with my mother, yes, but, then again,
she didn't plant a bomb on a plane
that killed over 200 people, now, did she, Nolan?
Aiden, we don't know the whole truth.
I mean, he tried to talk to a reporter, right?
What, to sell his story, rewrite history?
I mean, which one of those
is meant to make me feel better, eh, Nolan?
He wasn't David Clarke. He was a coward.
Hello?
Is something wrong?
I spoke with Conrad.
Is it true?
Did you profit off of David's death?
I don't have to explain myself.
I don't want to, and I don't have to.
You damn well better explain yourself now.
I need to know the truth.
I carried this guilt for 20 years
and every time I looked at Conrad,
I was forced to remember the choice I had to make.
And now he tells me that you're part of it.
I can't live like this.
Stop it.
Will you stop?!
Stop it!
Damn you!
Conrad wants this.
Don't give him that power.
He's trying to drive us apart. Don't you see?
I was brought as an investor.
I had nothing to do with it.
A reporter wanted to reveal the story about David.
That would have badly exposed Conrad.
And I knew if Conrad went down, he'd take you with him.
So, I silenced the story.
Because I love you.
I always loved you.
Conrad will keep coming at us...
unless we stop him.
I know.
There is something I could do,
but it's not without risk.
To be honest, Miss Thorne,
I'm surprised you're looking for a job.
But my divorce left me struggling.
You were screwed by the Graysons.
Trust me, I know how they operate.
That's right. You worked for Conrad.
Well, I would love to be a part of what you're doing now.
I have served on many boards in the green sector,
and maybe I could help smooth over some of the problems
you're having with environmentalists.
They're eco-terrorists.
Oh, no, I've spent a fortune defending myself.
Believe me, I'm the victim here.
You're full of crap.
I got family that lives near one of your wells.
The ground is poisoned. People can't drink the water.
This is what I'm talking about.
How do you live with yourself?
I carry these around to show people like you.
This is the compound my company uses
to extract gas from the ground.
And this is how dangerous it is.
So, I think what we've learned here
is that you don't know what you're talking about.
You've got an answer for everything, don't you?
Excuse me, but you're wrong.
Mr. Gilliam has won every single case ever brought against him.
That's 30 trials in 12 states,
so maybe you should dig a little deeper
than liberal propaganda before you attack someone's character.
I'm sorry for jumping in.
But...I'm a big proponent of doing your research.
And I'm impressed.
I'd like you to come to the awards tomorrow.
The locals seem restless,
and I could use someone like you in my corner.
Well, there's nowhere I'd rather be.
We're so pleased you could come.
And without your monitor.
Yeah, I'm a little confused.
I was supposed to be on house arrest
for another six months.
Yeah, yeah, I called in a few favors
and got the terms of your parole changed.
What did I tell you about my brother?
Listen, Havier, it's no secret
why we wanted you to come in today.
you represent a new frontier in media technology.
And we have the resources to launch
both you and your product at the same time.
Javier, we can make you a star.
This can change your life, Javier.
This is amazing.
I'm blown away, guys.
Seriously. I just --
I know. You made a promise to Nolan.
Yes.
And your loyalty is honorable.
But this is a business decision,
and you must consider all your options.
Why don't you think about it on your test drive?
This is a key to a Mclaren.
How did you know that's my favorite car?
I asked your program.
Oh, of course you did.
Why don't you go see what she can do, huh? Yeah.
Hell, yeah!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Have fun.
Brenda Evans?
Yes?
We'd like to ask you a few questions
About Oscar Chapman.
My god, you're Oscar Chapman.
I-I didn't realize who you both were.
I thought you were here to kill me.
I-I'm very sorry, Mr. Ross.
It's no problem.
I always found the use of both arms redundant.
How did you find me?
We have our ways...
Brenda?
I'm only her when I leave home.
The people I'm hiding from have never stopped looking for me.
So, I guess it's no surprise
that Trevor Mathis' son didn't stop, either.
How do you know my father?
I'd just moved to London,
and he came to me with the story of a lifetime.
Why you and not the police?
Well, he didn't know who he could trust.
He had already been lied to once
when they told him that they'd...
They'd free your sister if he planted that bomb.
But I don't understand. Why would he let all those people die?
Your father had no idea what he planted on that plane.
They told him it was diamonds.
When we met, he carried so much shame.
Having to hide that from you and your mother consumed him.
He was desperate to make things right.
Then why kill himself?
I'm sorry.
Your father was murdered.
He had every intention of facing what he did.
But Mr. Lemarchal had other ideas.
Yeah, the second I gave Pascal that-that story,
I knew I'd made a mistake.
And, so, I-I called your dad,
and I told him to collect everything he could
and to meet me, but he never showed.
And when I heard about that suicide,
I knew Pascal had staged that whole thing.
He killed your father.
We need you to come forward, Mr. Chapman.
We can help you get your life back.
Your real life.
But only if you stop hiding.
Please...
Help me finish my father's fight.
I'll do whatever you need.
This room is, uh...
It's bigger than the apartment building that I grew up in.
Oh, not there!
That would be like breaking 50 mirrors.
I do not care.
I feel invincible with you by my side.
Does that mean you'll sign?
I can't betray Nolan.
We're more than just friends.
We...
We're brothers.
You only knew him behind bars.
But out here, he'll do whatever it takes to win.
That's why he stuck you with that crappy deal.
Look, I'm sure he's gonna change it.
He wants to take your ideas and shove you in the background.
You can either be next to Nolan Ross,
or you can be the next Nolan Ross.
Chapman's agreed to help us.
That's great.
Well, we've made some good progress, too.
So take your time.
And, Aiden...
I'm happy for you.
So, he's, uh, back in the picture?
Well, it's complicated.
Say no more.
I know all about complicated.
So, I'm assuming this isn't what Gilliam uses in his mines.
It's a mixture of saline and gelatin.
So he's lying to everyone.
Well, you can use that, right?
What's on here?
His undoing.
I had a feeling you'd be stopping by.
If memory serves,
Armagnac is your elixir of choice for a broken heart.
You know, I wish I could say that I was sorry,
but we both know few sounds are sweeter
than the crumbling of your fellow man.
I have everything handled.
There won't be any fallout.
Just stay calm, and it'll all be fine.
Do you recall our chats from 1993?
So, that's what you have on me.
You recorded our conversations.
About the bomb, David...
Every word.
You're on those tapes, too.
But I control what the world hears...
Which means...
I control you.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I am.
'Cause, uh...
I know a little bit about unresolved father issues
And, uh, how it feels to get past them.
How about a hug, big guy?
Or not.
I assume your diligence with that new deal
has something to do with the boy Charlotte brought home.
I have to say, Daniel, I don't like you using your sister.
Oh, I'm not. She does what she wants.
And I actually think she likes him.
He's a felon.
Then he should fit right in.
I noticed these lying around.
Isn't this the guy you had the dust-up with at the track?
What's his story?
Luke Gilliam used to work with your father.
Was he involved with the, uh...?
I have a major deal about to close.
Tell me nothing is about to blow back on this family.
Oh, Luke won't be a problem.
How can you be so sure?
Because I brought him here.
That fight was just for show.
Who do you think nominated him
for that absurd award he's receiving?
What are you up to?
I'm merely testing a theory.
Oh, so, this is about Emily?
And your maneuver to steal Nolan's protoce? Isn't?
Happy hunting.
Awards are a platform to help us spread our message.
Excuse me.
Emily, glad you could make it.
Oh, I wouldn't miss it.
Listen, I've been getting a lot of tweets from our local nature nuts.
Can you run interference in case things take a turn?
Absolutely.
Just stick to your presentation. That'll shut them up.
Oh, nothing ever stops people with an agenda.
Victoria?
I don't believe it.
Once cameras arrive,
of course you put aside your righteous indignation.
hypocrisy is alive and well and living in the Hamptons.
Well, we've finally hit upon a subject on which you're an expert.
Oh, you're not on the guest list, Vicki,
but I'm sure we can drum up something for you...in the back.
I wasn't expecting to see you here, Victoria.
Well, I can only hope it comes as a terrible disappointment to you.
Looky. Looky.
This came from my lawyers.
And I think...
you will be happy with the changes.
But I wanted to fix the bugs in the source code,
and I can't find it in the cloud. Did you move it?
Where's your monitor?
My parole officer took it off.
Daniel Grayson called in a favor.
That's why my clone is not on the server.
I didn't think it would be right for you to keep working on it.
Javier, listen to me.
This program -- it's not ready.
You -- you're not ready.
You cannot go into business with these people.
And it is not even up for debate!
It never is with you, is it?!
It's always gonna be what Nolan Ross wants.
Daniel and Margaux -- they are looking out for me.
You will regret this.
No one plays me.
Oh, but you've already been played.
Before I take my leave,
I'd like to address the activists out there
who question my integrity.
I want them to know I run the cleanest, safest,
greenest company on the planet,
not because it's good business,
but because I truly love our beautiful mother we call earth.
And if I can put these chemicals in her,
you can be damn sure
they're safe enough to put in me.
Oh, no.
Mr. Gilliam, are you all right?
I need a doctor now.
I thought you said the formula was safe.
It's not, you idiot!
Mr. Lemarchal, I beg of you --
Do you know what your problem always was?
You were too good a reporter.
Environmental activists
welcome the revelations caught on camera
that confirm the rumors that have hounded Luke Gilliam for years.
The once celebrated Gilliam Natural Gas Company --
Luke Gilliam...
we have unfinished business.
What the...?
You did this to me.
I could have died!
The drug I used was harmless.
I need you alive.
What do you want with me?
The leverage that you have on Conrad Grayson.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Look at where you are.
Do you really want to lie to me?
Why would I give that up to you?
Because if you don't,
I will make every day of your life hell.
I will make you pay for all of the people that you've hurt --
both now and in the past.
And that's not a threat.
It's a promise.
I'll give you what you want.
But, please, leave me alone.
Margaux?
Nolan called me.
Yeah.
Well, I guess he must be upset.
So, you did screw him over.
No. Daniel and I made a better offer.
It wasn't about money for Nolan.
He wanted to help that kid, but Daniel
wants to use him like he uses everyone
including you.
Are we really doing this again?
I know that you think Daniel is your friend,
but trust me, he's not.
He gets off on doing this to us, and I wish you could see that.
I've worked all my life to get here,
and it's finally happening.
I wish you could see that.
I can't,
not when my friends end up your collateral damage.
Jack...
Jack, don't leave like this.
Please.
I love you, Margaux, but right now, I can't be around you.
So, I, uh, I got you something.
A Bentley?
Think of it as a finder's fee for delivering Javier.
No, I didn't do this for a car.
I just want what's best for Javier.
Okay, well, give it back, then.
No way!
I'm sorry.
Did I interrupt?
Are you out of your mind?
No.
But you must be for pissing off a genius.
Wow. I knew you were a loser.
I didn't know you were a sore one.
Ah, you may have infected Margaux and this one,
but I won't let you do the same to Javier.
I just want you to understand --
this is...
war.
Mr. Mathis?
Surprised?
Surely you must know I keep track of all the pieces on the board.
What do you want?
That's not the right question.
It's what you want --
Pascal Lemarchal.
I assume your return on the heels of his arrival
was no coincidence.
You've learned the truth about him.
Well, why don't you tell me?
You seem enlightened on these things.
While you, on the other hand, are fumbling through the dark.
I'm afraid Pascal has already paid a visit to Mr. Chapman.
He's cleaning house,
and you're next unless I run interference for you.
And why would you do that?
Well, because he has something I want,
and I believe you can get it.
Go to hell.
You will find that it's better to make an ally of me
than an enemy, Mr. Mathis.
Is this guy going to be a problem?
No, in the end, he'll do what I want, Mr. Marino...
Just as Pascal did,
once we alerted him to the whereabouts of Mr. Chapman.
Luke Gilliam had the money transfers from the terrorists.
It proves that Conrad was the original contact.
So, this -- this is all the evidence you need?
No, this only proves Conrad's involvement.
I mean, I-it doesn't clear my father's name,
but I'm getting close.
Look, I'm glad that
you stopped that guy from hurting other people,
but watch out for yourself, too.
Deal.
All right, well, I got to get back to Carl.
Oh, and good luck on the big move with Margaux.
Actually, I'm not so sure that's going to happen anymore.
What?
In fact, I don't, uh...
I don't think we're gonna make it.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah. I am.
Good night.
Good night.
Alliances can reunite old friends in the most unexpected of ways...
...by testing the bonds that are the strongest of all.
They can lead to the greatest of victories...
...or to your ultimate defeat.
None of this was chance.
It was Emily.
1992年高管集体度假
Imagine hiding your life away.
All this time, I thought she was waging war on our family,
but this goes much farther.
It's revenge...
...for David.
