we had some girls come into our tent
and we ended up making out with them .
what is your goal here , timothy ?
to turn the student body against the administration ? !
i &apos;ve been fired .
this is our school .
if we don &apos;t like something about it ,
we have to do something to change it .
my foster parents know i narced on them .
think they &apos;re gonna welcome me back with open arms ?
where &apos;s your friend ?
she ran away .
flintwood has one of the best athletic programs in the country .
my moms couldn &apos;t afford it .
i &apos;m offering you a scholarship .
they told me i can get 11 years for kidnapping .
i &apos;m not gonna let that happen .
you don &apos;t have control !
robert does , &apos; cause i &apos;m gonna live with him .
i can &apos;t even look stef and lina in the face right now .
i swore that i would never lie to them again .
why don &apos;t you just tell them ?
do you wanna go to jail ?
because that &apos;s what would happen .
i would be taking you and brandon down with me .
you can &apos;t tell anyone . and stef , she &apos;s a police officer .
she can &apos;t protect you , not without risking her own career .
i think i should go live with robert .
if this is what you truly want , we &apos;ll stand beside you .
so how soon ?
well , there &apos;s paperwork to be done , i don &apos;t know ...
probably ... a few days ?
how could you just let her do this ?
sweetheart , we need to respect and support callie &apos;s decision .
we &apos;re still a family .
families live together .
are you sure about this ?
you won &apos;t change your mind ?
i can &apos;t . i told the judge .
it &apos;s not , uh ...
it &apos;s not because of ...
no . brandon , no . it &apos;s ...
i &apos;m just really tired of fighting .
and , it &apos;s not like i &apos;m not gonna be around a lot , still .
yeah , i mean i hope so .
well , good night .
hey , are you awake ?
well , just in case , i just want you to know i &apos;m sorry .
hello ?
hey , it &apos;s me .
daphne ? where are you ?
i &apos;m at girls united .
isn &apos;t it kinda late ?
look , i can &apos;t talk .
i just wanted you to know , i told the police about tasha .
that i took her .
daphne ...
and that i did it alone .
so you and brandon don &apos;t have to worry .
why aren &apos;t you in juvie ?
rita made it so i could stay at girls united , until my hearing .
why did you ...
so you don &apos;t have to go live with robert .
it &apos;s over . you &apos;re safe .
look , i gotta go .
daphne ...
why aren &apos;t you dressed ?
i &apos;m not going to school .
are you sick ?
no .
does this have to do with callie ?
no , this doesn &apos;t have anything to do with callie .
there are other things going on in my life , you know .
i &apos;m protesting .
in case you &apos;ve forgot , you fired my favorite teacher yesterday .
i didn &apos;t ... you are going to school .
no , i &apos;m not . and it &apos;s not just me .
it &apos;s the whole sophomore class .
you are the daughter of the vice principal ...
and a member of the student council .
but because you are my mother i will tell you ,
we &apos;re organizing a rally for monday .
and we &apos;re hoping for media coverage .
you want something else for breakfast , love ?
uh , no , thanks . i &apos;m fine .
so i hear you have a girlfriend now .
what &apos;s her name ? trina ?
taylor . and she &apos;s not my girlfriend .
well , apparently the twins aren &apos;t going to school today .
oh , yeah , me either . the juniors are protesting , too .
protesting what ?
that mom fired timothy .
i ... can i talk to you for a second , please ?
what are we gonna do ?
i &apos;m not sure what we can do .
i need your support here .
and you have it .
but they &apos;re a little too big to carry out the front door .
i mean , i could arrest them for truancy ...
this isn &apos;t funny .
look , it &apos;s one day .
and trust me , they &apos;re gonna be so bored by the end of it
they &apos;re gonna be dying to go back to school on monday .
bored ? with their computers and their phones and their video ...
... games .
but how are we supposed to do our homework ?
you have got pencils and paper and text books , don &apos;t you ?
i &apos;ll be taking your phones as well , please .
i could take you off the family plan anytime i want .
what ? mom ! what if we need to get in touch with you ?
use the home phone .
what if we &apos;re not home ?
oh , no . you are staying home from school , you are staying home .
um , you do realize this means we can &apos;t record our shows , right ?
not helping . did you get the wireless router ?
yeah , it &apos;s right there .
you &apos;re taking the internet ?
you can &apos;t do that !
yeah , i &apos;m pretty sure this is like unconstitutional .
you &apos;re obstructing our attempt to organize , mama .
you can still call your comrades on the land @-@ line .
yeah , like we know anyone &apos;s number .
i &apos;m not trying to shut down your protest ,
just your entertainment .
be careful !
just take it easy .
what ?
we &apos;ve got our whole lives in there .
enjoy your day off .
hey , here . let me help you with that .
ok .
i &apos;m the one that took tasha .
and i &apos;m the one &apos;s that &apos;s gotta pay for it .
all you and brandon did was help me take her back .
stef don &apos;t have to report that .
i &apos;d still have to tell them everything .
and i &apos;d be getting brandon in trouble and he &apos;s got the tour ...
so you &apos;re gonna go live with robert
so brandon can play a few gigs in some dive bars ?
girl , that &apos;s just like stupid .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
the judge isn &apos;t going to let me change my mind now , all right ?
it &apos;s too late .
daph , hey ... callie ?
what are you doing here ?
come here , i got a surprise for you .
come on .
look who who &apos;s back at girls united .
word .
yes !
a little love . little love .
more than half the sophomores
and a good two @-@ thirds of the juniors
either called in &quot; sick &quot; or just didn &apos;t show .
they &apos;re calling us dictatorial and monocratic online .
at least they know some big words .
thanks to timothy ... in part .
listen , i &apos;ve also had quite a few calls
from parents and a few board members .
do you think we made a mistake firing timothy ?
well , technically i fired him .
and i certainly understand why .
you had every reason to be upset , but ...
you think i was wrong ?
i think you asked him to teach more non @-@ fiction and ,
yes , he was being an ass , but a complying ass .
if this were a business and an employee was that insubordinate ...
this is not a business .
in an academia we encourage debate
and opinions that may differ from the administration &apos;s .
this is anchor beach , not harvard , lena .
and what this school needs to get out of debt ,
is strong leadership , which it has not had .
we ... we can &apos;t lead if the students have control .
so i need you to send an email
letting them and their parents know
if they are absent on monday
without a legitimate excuse , they &apos;ll be suspended .
suspended ? isn &apos;t that a little bit extreme ?
it &apos;s not open for debate .
either you send it , or i will .
you &apos;ll get used to it .
i just pretend like
i &apos;m watching a super boring documentary about , like ,
the mating rituals of meerkats .
and then it &apos;s like they &apos;re not even here .
have any of you guys been to the fair yet ?
it &apos;s the last weekend .
i was thinking we could all go tomorrow ?
we &apos;re going to the pier , but you guys should totally go .
the fair sounds fun . we can go to the pier anytime .
i can &apos;t . i have plans with family .
what about sunday ?
perfect . then we can still go to the pier .
all weekend . we &apos;re going camping .
didn &apos;t you just go camping ?
we &apos;re going again .
sorry .
so you gotta go live with your birth dad ? dang .
what &apos;s up with you ?
just glad to be outta juvie . it &apos;s messed up in there .
girl &apos;s busting on each other like dudes .
is becka still in , or ... ?
nah , they got her in some drug rehab last i heard .
but gabi &apos;s back in .
she is ?
she said she &apos;s seen kiara .
where ?
south east . on el cajon .
damn .
what ?
that ain &apos;t a street you wanna be on .
why ? what goes on there ?
what , am i interrupting something ?
carmen , feet , please . what &apos;re we talking about ?
gabi saw kiara .
on el cajon .
working ?
what &apos;s she doing , selling drugs ?
worse .
tory ...
tony , gwynn .
played right field for the padres .
i didn &apos;t know you were into sports .
i &apos;m not , really . but my grandfather was .
he gave it to me , before he died , so ...
what do you think it &apos;s worth ?
i &apos;m not sure .
look it up online .
well , um , my mom sort of , uh ...
took the internet away .
you know , to make sure we &apos;re not having any fun .
there are other ways to have fun .
and that &apos;s probably why you asked me over .
well , she didn &apos;t say we had to stay home alone .
seriously . maybe you could sell it for enough to go on the tour .
yeah , well , my other mom would probably kill me
and i don &apos;t know , it kinda feels ...
disrespectful , i guess , to my grandfather .
it &apos;s not like he &apos;ll ever know .
unless you think he &apos;s looking down on you from heaven ?
well , i don &apos;t know about heaven ,
but i think they can maybe see us .
so , do you think he &apos;s watching us now ?
i sort of hope not .
and talk about a buzz kill .
we can do this everyday , on tour .
just saying ...
stop talking .
we have to do something .
we &apos;re not in the business of chasing after runaways , ok ?
we &apos;re not the police . this is not a prison .
if kiara wants to turn her life around ,
she &apos;s gonna have to turn herself in .
and if she does , maybe i can convince the judge
to allow her to come back here .
she only ran way because she was in a messed up foster home
and they were going to send her back there .
she didn &apos;t have a choice .
we always have a choice , you know that .
sometimes the choice sucks ,
but is she really in a better place now on the streets ,
selling herself ? i don &apos;t think so .
maybe if she knew that there was a new girls united ?
maybe . and maybe not .
but it is not our job to save kiara .
excuse me , ladies .
so , i was thinking , maybe next time ...
mm , you think there &apos;s going to be a next time ?
well , i kind of hope so .
not even gonna ask . bye .
ok , bye .
call me .
if you &apos;re lucky .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m trying to hack my reader , so i can get onto facebook .
why are you holding them like that ?
so i can pick up mr. nesbit &apos;s wi @-@ fi .
if you were an old man , what would your password be ?
one , two , three , four .
well , i don &apos;t know .
go next door and ask for it then .
i would if he was home .
where does a retired man go all day ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe there &apos;s a sale on christmas decorations .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i just realized that callie won &apos;t be with us
for christmas next year .
it &apos;s fine , i mean , she &apos;ll still be over a lot .
it &apos;s not like she &apos;s leaving the country .
yeah , but it &apos;s not the same as living under the same roof ,
seeing each other every day . that &apos;s what makes you a family .
hey , we &apos;ll still be a family ,
even when we all go to college in a couple years .
exactly .
we &apos;re all gonna be gone . this is all we &apos;ve got .
i just ...
i &apos;m not ready for things to change yet .
yeah .
hey , you ready ?
i am .
but it looks like we &apos;re gonna have some company .
connor &apos;s father called
and asked if he could spend the night tonight .
why ?
because he &apos;s out of town on business and his flight got canceled .
hey , it &apos;ll be fun .
we &apos;ll order some pizza , i &apos;ll bake some cookies .
ok ?
yeah .
ok . uh , i &apos;ve got to drop something off .
i &apos;ll meet you guys at the car .
ok .
what happened to your family camping trip ?
free for dinner ?
uh ... yeah .
so what about idyllwild ? where are you with that ?
i guess kind of nowhere .
i don &apos;t know . i really wanna go on tour .
oh , yeah ?
yeah , i don &apos;t know . i wanna have some adventure .
and i &apos;m actually really into the music we &apos;re playing .
plus you &apos;re really into that girl too , right ?
you guys getting serious ?
i , uh ... i guess so . yeah .
what ? what &apos;s that smirk ?
nothing , i just ...
we had a good day today .
i see .
what ? don &apos;t give me that patented safe sex speech ...
i wasn &apos;t going to . all right , maybe i was .
so , what , that &apos;s the reason
you &apos;re all gung @-@ ho on the tour and all that ?
no ! no , i swear .
i think it &apos;d be kind of , i don &apos;t know , like , life @-@ changing .
problem is , i still don &apos;t have the money , but ...
well , your mom &apos;s pretty adamant
about you guys staying in motels , so ...
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna be able to change her mind on that one .
no , i mean , that wasn &apos;t what i was asking .
i was wondering , um ...
if you think mom would freak
if i sold that autographed baseball
that grandpa gave me .
the tony gwynn ?
yeah , i don &apos;t know . i looked it up online .
if i sold it , i would basically be able to cover the whole tour .
but , you know , i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t wanna be disrespectful to grandpa &apos;s memory either .
that &apos;s a tough one , brandon .
so you think it &apos;d be wrong ?
i think it &apos;s your baseball .
and it &apos;s not like grandpa gave it to you with any conditions .
and i &apos;m not into sports , you know .
and ...
i know !
don &apos;t you think he &apos;d want me to use it
for something i really am into ?
you know , something i really want ?
that was not an email , that was an act of oppression .
all we want is the chance to be heard .
and how is it you saw this act of oppression
with no access to the internet ?
we got online using mr. nesbit &apos;s wi @-@ fi .
you can pick it up in certain areas of the house .
like the front porch .
would you shush !
the front porch is technically part of the house .
never said it wasn &apos;t .
and what exactly did you get online with ?
mariana hacked our readers .
what part of &quot; shush &quot; don &apos;t not understand ?
oh , i did not know you could do that .
me either .
you can if you know how .
i gotta say , it &apos;s pretty impressive .
right ? you &apos;re like a cute steve jobs .
ok , all right . can we please just change the subject ?
we have a dinner guest here and i &apos;m sure he &apos;s bored to tears .
i &apos;m not bored .
having dinner with just me and my dad ? that &apos;s boring .
well , that &apos;s the nice part about being in a big family .
don &apos;t know why anyone would wanna give that up .
mariana .
it &apos;s fine .
well , connor , it is very nice to have you .
it &apos;s been a long time since you &apos;ve spent the night .
not long enough .
i got an idea .
why don &apos;t you sleep in the tent in the backyard ?
and you guys can pretend like you &apos;re camping .
so now that connor &apos;s dad assumes that jude is straight ,
it &apos;s suddenly ok for his son to spend the night ?
i didn &apos;t know what to say .
he was in a bind and i was on the spot .
it &apos;s not that connor isn &apos;t welcome ...
i just can &apos;t fight another battle today .
you think jude &apos;s ok with it ?
nah ...
they have been hanging out a lot more .
yeah , in groups .
i think he &apos;s just happy to have his best friend back .
do you think jude has a crush on connor ?
oh , i don &apos;t even think jude &apos;s sure about his sexuality .
he &apos;s questioning it , which i don &apos;t think he would do
if he was straight .
he was straight ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess kids are freer to question things these days .
you know , i just ...
when i was 13 , i had a crush on my best friend .
she dressed like madonna , you know ,
the leather jacket , the bracelets ... ooh !
she was the bomb ! but , uh ,
we were inseparable until she got a boyfriend
and i was utterly heart @-@ broken .
madonna ?
i was more of a whitney girl .
so how do you know that connor doesn &apos;t have a crush on jude ?
really ? connor doesn &apos;t seem gay to me .
well , no one ever seems to think i seem gay .
oh . unlike me , i guess .
well , the cop uniform doesn &apos;t exactly help .
well , i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m going to have to arrest you then .
for what ?
for profiling .
and for perpetuating sexual stereotypes .
ahh , you &apos;re gonna have to cuff me first .
oh , you &apos;d like that , wouldn &apos;t you ?
what ?
you really think this is what callie wants ?
she says it is .
and we &apos;re just supposed to take her at her word ?
i don &apos;t ...
oh , just i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re losing her .
hey , thanks for the pajamas .
thank jesus .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s very happy i &apos;m here .
he &apos;s cool .
are you still going to the pier tomorrow ?
nah . my dad &apos;s not gonna be back until late ,
so i &apos;m supposed to just hang here &apos; til he picks me up .
if that &apos;s ok ?
sure .
what are you playing ?
star wars : commander .
but i can &apos;t beat the krayt dragon .
you gotta use your stormtroopers to lure him out .
then you just hit it with your other troops .
here , can i show you ?
see here ? this is the fastest way to get to level up .
see these , no more of these troops ,
we have to bring in some of these guys over here .
and they will distract him .
yeah , you also gotta send troops over there , too .
nice ! good job !
yes ! we got it !
finally .
on to the next one .
yeah .
what &apos;s up ?
someone saw kiara on el cajon .
they said she &apos;s , working as a prostitute .
oh yeah ? who &apos;s they ?
a friend of daphne &apos;s . or someone she knows , i guess .
well , that &apos;s a pretty rough part of town .
rita said that there &apos;s nothing that we can do .
you talked to rita ?
daphne did , yeah .
well , i guess i could talk to some vice cops ,
and ask them to keep an eye out ,
but short of her getting arrested ...
couldn &apos;t we go looking for her ?
no . absolutely not .
you most certainly cannot . that &apos;s a horrible part of town .
it &apos;s not just prostitution , there &apos;s a major gang presence ,
and kiara &apos;s not ...
the girls working there are not working for themselves .
they have pimps , who have them brainwashed and on drugs .
and the girl that you would
find down on el cajon is not the kiara you know .
so please , promise me that
you will not go down there looking for her .
i won &apos;t . i promise .
still not used to you wearing those .
forget steve jobs ,
you &apos;re like a cute clark kent .
are you ever gonna speak to me again , or ... ?
mariana , i &apos;m sorry that you &apos;re upset ...
aren &apos;t you upset ?
of course i &apos;m upset . you &apos;re like my sister .
i thought i was your sister . and what about jude ?
ok , mariana , not everything is about you , ok ?
and your coding and your dance team
and your frickin &apos; abandonment issues , ok ?
there are some things i just can &apos;t explain to you .
and i need you to get it , this isn &apos;t easy for me .
and just not make me feel any worse than i already do .
i &apos;m sorry .
i just ...
i &apos;m gonna miss you .
i &apos;m gonna miss you , too .
yo , baby .
kiara .
kiara , come on . let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go .
my car is parked right there .
we gotta get out of here , honey , but we gotta go now .
let &apos;s go . come on .
rita ...
you got people who care about you , i care about you .
you know you &apos;re better than this . come on !
come on ...
i said i don &apos;t do bitches !
get outta my face before i cut you !
we got a problem ?
i told her i ain &apos;t no dyke !
no , we don &apos;t . i thought i knew ...
i don &apos;t know you , bitch .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , you are sorry .
get outta here .
ok .
ok .
nice catch .
go back . double play . go again .
three in a row .
i &apos;m sorry .
very funny .
oh , sorry ! that was an accident .
oh yeah ?
no . no ! go away .
nope . no , get away .
ok , ok .
ok , i give up !
what are you doing ?
sorry , daria just texted me .
she wants to know if we wanna come over .
do you ?
i mean , what else is there to do ?
you should go then , if you want to .
no , it &apos;s fine , we don &apos;t have to .
whatever , just go .
i decided i don &apos;t want to go to boarding school anymore .
why ?
i &apos;m not ready to leave home .
ok .
are you sure you don &apos;t want to hear the guy out ?
no .
does this have something to do with your sister ?
jesus .
i can &apos;t leave her , mom .
she &apos;s already freaking out about callie .
if she finds out you and mom aren &apos;t adopting ana &apos;s baby ,
she &apos;ll have a meltdown . it &apos;s like she &apos;s losing two sisters .
and then if i go away ... i can &apos;t do that to her .
it &apos;s not your job to look after mariana .
look , mom , i don &apos;t want to go .
just cancel it , please ?
ok . i will talk to mom .
we &apos;ve got to stop meeting like this .
look , i &apos;m sorry .
ok ? i ...
it &apos;s my first month on the job
and i &apos;ve got students staging a walkout .
i felt less pressure managing multi @-@ million dollar businesses .
it &apos;s a hard job .
and that &apos;s why i need your help .
hi , i &apos;m dan cruz .
i &apos;m here to meet with jesus .
well , no one &apos;s here ...
except , a bunch of my guy friends on the football team .
well , we had an appointment .
you had an appointment ? with jesus ?
yeah , i &apos;m a recruiter with flintwood academy .
we &apos;re interested in offering your brother a scholarship .
an academic scholarship ?
well , no . yes .
we &apos;re also recruiting for wrestling .
well , maybe they forgot ?
well , you can give them my card .
they can call to reschedule .
ok .
wait .
where is this school ?
colorado .
see ya .
here the kids out .
let them have their say , even if it isn &apos;t the final one .
it makes them feel respected and who doesn &apos;t need that ?
ok . we &apos;ll hear them out .
as long as they show up for school on monday .
that sounds fair to me .
now if i could only get my own kids to listen to reason .
what happened ?
well , if you promise not to tell anyone ...
when they refused to go to school yesterday ,
i ... i may have packed up all their electronics , including the dvr ,
and rolled it out the front door in a suitcase .
that &apos;s gotta be hard being their mom and their vice principal .
especially when i &apos;m not doing a great job at either .
before you came to anchor beach , right before ,
i was , i was five months pregnant and i lost the baby .
lena , i &apos;m so sorry .
yeah , it &apos;s been hard , i &apos;m not gonna lie .
of course .
and now , our twins &apos; birth mom is pregnant ,
and she &apos;s asked stef and me to adopt her baby .
and i feel terrible because
just a few months ago i wanted one so badly .
so how do i explain to my daughter ,
who really wants us to bring this baby into the family
that ... now i don &apos;t want to .
it &apos;s her half @-@ sister .
i just feel like i &apos;m being really selfish .
i had a miscarriage .
i was only a few months in , but if somebody had asked me
to adopt a baby just a little while later ...
i wouldn &apos;t have been ready .
you need time to grieve , and ...
it &apos;s not your fault .
thank you .
that helps .
and i &apos;m sorry about your ...
oh , thanks .
and , since we &apos;re sharing ,
i guess you should know ...
... timothy was our donor .
i texted daria back
and i told her i &apos;m just gonna stay here .
it &apos;s not nice to lead people on .
ok , well , i &apos;m not .
come on .
stop it .
are you ok ?
i didn &apos;t ... i didn &apos;t mean to kick you that hard .
why &apos;d you kick me at all ?
you kissed me , remember ? in the tent ?
and then at the movie theater , you held my hand .
and now , all day you &apos;ve been ...
i just ... i don &apos;t get this .
i don &apos;t get you .
are you ok ?
come with me .
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re mad , i &apos;m not going .
i &apos;m mad because you didn &apos;t tell me .
i didn &apos;t tell you , because i &apos;m not going .
why not ?
because i &apos;m not ready to leave home .
i looked it up on line .
it &apos;s a really good college prep school .
i mean , it &apos;s military ,
but i can see you getting into the whole gi joe thing .
and there &apos;s no girls , which is good .
not for me .
yes , for you .
well , wait , do you want me to go ?
no .
ok , well i &apos;m not .
but i think you should .
why ?
because i see how hard it is for you ,
at school and there &apos;s so much going on around here ,
you know , distractions and stuff , and ...
and they want you , which is super cool .
and ...
... i want what &apos;s best for you ,
even if it &apos;s hard ... for me .
yes !
just tell her to stay away .
why don &apos;t you tell her ?
i don &apos;t need nobody trying to save me . i got it good right now .
what , selling yourself on the street ?
i know what you &apos;re doing . how is that good ?
i don &apos;t need you judging me .
ok , ok ! i &apos;m not judging you . i &apos;m really not .
i &apos;m just ... really scared for you .
you don &apos;t gotta be .
i finally got a roof over my head and someone who cares about me .
and there ain &apos;t no way in hell i &apos;m going back in the system !
we &apos;re like a family .
what are you ... a family ?
what about girls united ? rita &apos;s got a new house now .
and carmen and daphne are there .
and rita said if you turn yourself in ...
they &apos;ll take me back to juvie .
yeah , for a few days .
but rita &apos;s gonna call the judge and have you placed with her .
ok ? that &apos;s probably what she was trying to tell you last night .
you won &apos;t ever have to go to another foster home .
you can live at girls united until you &apos;re eighteen .
go to school , get a diploma .
you can become a social worker , like you wanted ,
and work with kids .
and i will see you all the time .
me and rita and daphne , we are your family .
please , kiara . i can &apos;t do this without you .
i spit in her face .
do you think she &apos;d still want me , after that ?
oh , rita &apos;s pretty tough . i guarantee she &apos;s took worse .
ok .
i &apos;ll turn myself in .
but , i gotta go to my place , get some of my stuff .
no , they &apos;ll just take it from you in juvie .
not if you keep it for me .
it &apos;s just stuff .
no , it ain &apos;t .
james bought me some nice clothes
and shoes and a diamond necklace .
you think he &apos;s just gonna let you take it all and leave ?
he ain &apos;t around during the day . how you think i &apos;m here now ?
you know how it is , you &apos;ve been in the system .
i never get to keep nothing .
every time they moved me to a new foster house ,
they &apos;d take my stuff away , or they make me leave it behind .
and i ain &apos;t doing that again .
nobody ever bought me nice things .
ok , i &apos;m going with you .
callie ...
no , i &apos;m not letting you go there alone .
my shift &apos;s almost over . just wait here , ok ?
i mean it . wait here .
ok ?
ok .
well , i can &apos;t believe someone bought it , b. that &apos;s great !
yeah , so all i have to do now is ship it to the buyer ...
... but then i figured , why waste the postage , right ?
i know your address , dad .
i thought they shipped through the website .
you can &apos;t afford this .
hey , it &apos;s an investment , right ?
i mean , it &apos;s value &apos;s just gonna keep going up and ...
... this way it stays in the family .
so you think it was wrong for me to sell it .
no , i don &apos;t think it was wrong .
i just think ...
i don &apos;t know , brandon ,
i just thought maybe one day you &apos;ll regret it and then ,
well , you can buy it back from me , for more than i paid .
think of it as a loan , with collateral .
thanks , dad .
you ready ?
so we have to take the southeast bus , right ?
yeah .
ok .
i called him .
sorry .
no , kiara ...
let go of me !
no , i &apos;m not ... you &apos;re just scared , kiara ...
you don &apos;t wanna mess with him .
i &apos;m not gonna let you do this ! i &apos;m not .
you wanna get yourself beat the hell up ?
callie , just let me go !
i couldn &apos;t let you go back there . i &apos;m sorry .
please , don &apos;t give up on yourself .
come on .
come on .
come on , let &apos;s go .
listen to me , it &apos;s ok .
you did the right thing . i &apos;m proud of you for calling me , love .
don &apos;t be proud of me .
ok , what &apos;s going on ?
you need to talk to me and you need to talk to me now .
now .
i did something wrong and i couldn &apos;t tell you .
ok . what ? why ?
because , i was afraid .
afraid of what ? afraid we were gonna get mad
afraid you &apos;d get in trouble ?
both , i guess . i ...
i just thought ...
i was afraid because i lied , again .
and because i didn &apos;t come to you again .
and because i messed up again .
i thought that maybe
that would mean that you wouldn &apos;t want me anymore .
like you would just finally give up on me .
and is this why you &apos;re going to live with robert ?
i just i thought that if i left on my own ,
it wouldn &apos;t hurt as much as if you told me to go ,
but it does ! it hurts so much !
ok , listen ...
hon , look at me !
nothing you can do is gonna make us not want you .
you hear me ? nothing .
nothing , baby .
ok .
nothing . come here .
come here .
do you hate me ?
i &apos;m glad you told them .
what if they don &apos;t let you go ?
i would give up the tour
and just about anything else for you to be a part of this family .
don &apos;t you get that by now ?
i just ...
i wish you &apos;d told them before ...
i know .
it &apos;ll be easier going to live with robert ,
knowing i don &apos;t have to lie about it .
i know what you did . callie told us everything .
and if you ever tell her to lie to us again , i swear ...
look , i was just doing what i thought was best for my daughter ...
your daughter ?
yes . my daughter .
it &apos;s over .
all right ? the judge has decided .
we &apos;ll see about that .
you &apos;re just wasting your time , stef . you &apos;re too late .
well , i &apos;m not going down without a fight ...
