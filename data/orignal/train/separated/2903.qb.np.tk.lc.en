thanks for coming by .
we wanted to bounce some ideas off of you about the wedding ceremony .
what &apos;s the matter ? are you okay ?
it &apos;s just ...
monica said , &quot; wedding . &quot;
we thought one of you could read something .
i would love to read a poem .
do you think you could get through a poem ?
a short one .
okay , so ross will be doing the reading .
okay , yeah , i guess i can do that too .
too ?
i kind of have something else planned for you guys .
do you mind telling us what it is ?
sorry .
i &apos;m kind of keeping this one on the q . t.
whatever it is , i hope it involves winking .
hey .
hey .
i talked to one of the dool writers ...
what is dool ?
days of our lives .
you &apos;re not gonna believe it . my character is coming out of his coma !
that &apos;s wonderful .
wow , joey .
and not only that , i &apos;m getting a new brain !
so great things are happening at work and in your personal life .
you &apos;re getting a new brain ?
they &apos;re killing off one of the characters on the show ...
... and her brain is being transplanted into my body .
what ? a brain transplant ?
yes , it &apos;s a highly controversial procedure .
it &apos;s ridiculous .
it &apos;s ridiculous that you haven &apos;t had sex in three and a half months .
it &apos;s winter . there are fewer people on the street .
who are they killing off ?
cecilia monroe . she plays jessica lockhart .
no !
she &apos;s my favorite character on dool .
nice .
she is so good at throwing drinks in people &apos;s faces .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever seen her finish a beverage .
the way she slaps people . wouldn &apos;t you love to do that ?
don &apos;t do it .
cecilia monroe , what a great actress .
tell me about it .
and she &apos;s been on the show forever .
it &apos;s gonna be really hard to fill her shoes .
help me out here .
when you come out of the brain transplant ...
... you are going to be her ?
yes , but in drake ramoray &apos;s body .
why is this so hard for you to get ? i thought you were a scientist .
the one with joey &apos;s new brain
rach , so that guy there ...
... straight or gay ?
well , i &apos;d have to say gay .
yeah ? why ?
mainly because he &apos;s kissing that other guy .
oh , no , not that guy there . that guy right there .
oh , yeah , he &apos;s too cute to be straight .
knockers will help us figure it out .
all right , straight .
and not subtle .
he left his cell phone .
we could hand it to gunther to put it in lost and found .
or we could use it to call china , see how those guys are doing .
what if he calls his own cell phone and i answer ...
... and we start talking and we fell in love ?
wouldrt that be a great story ?
kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age .
that does sound great . i &apos;m gonna get the phone .
what ? wait . why do you get the story ?
i haven &apos;t been out on a date in so long .
phoebe , you had a date three days ago .
that wasn &apos;t a date . that was friends getting together and having sex .
okay . great . i get the phone .
no way . you just broke up with tag a week ago .
yeah , and until now , i didn &apos;t think i would love again .
nice try .
wait .
how do we fairly decide who gets the phone ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe we could ...
aha ! too slow !
aha ! too cocky .
i &apos;m dating him . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
yes , there is .
what are you going to do , kill him ? like you did charles ?
that was an accident .
and so were you .
well , at least i &apos;m not a murderer .
oh , my baby .
cut !
that was a great scene . that slap looked so real . how do you do that ?
oh , just years of experience .
can i get some ice here ? !
i just wanted to say how wonderful i think you are .
you &apos;re not the fan who &apos;s dying , are you ?
i &apos;m supposed to meet and hug a fan who &apos;s dying .
but that &apos;s not suppose to be until later .
i &apos;m joey tribbiani . we did a scene together yesterday .
i &apos;m the guy in the coma .
oh , that was a real person ?
since i &apos;m getting your brain when you leave the show ...
... i was wondering if ...
i &apos;m leaving the show ?
why ? did you hear something ?
who told you that ?
one of the writers .
which writer ? was it bald or was it tall ?
you know , it doesn &apos;t matter , because it is not true .
okay .
and if it were true , how dare you come to me and ask me for tips ...
... about a character i &apos;ve played for 20 years !
miss monroe ... oh , there you go .
no , phoebe , you cannot get the phone that way . that &apos;s not fair .
okay , look , i have an idea .
why don &apos;t we see what kind of numbers he has on his speed dial ...
... and then whoever has more in common with him gets the phone .
or we can decide by whoever &apos;s name is closer to the word &quot; phone . &quot;
i don &apos;t think so .
fine . but i bet you &apos;d be singing a different tune if we were fighting over a ratchet .
first name on the speed dial is &quot; mom . &quot;
oh . i lost my mom to suicide .
no way . you can &apos;t use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin .
did i use that already today ? i &apos;m sorry .
well , now , see , this isn &apos;t telling us anything .
&quot; joe . carlos . yoga . ben ... &quot;
wait . i do yoga . that &apos;s one for me .
oh , all right . oh , so close . if only it said , &quot; yogurt . &quot;
&quot; peter luger . &quot; that &apos;s a steak house .
okay , fine . meat @-@ eater . fine , that &apos;s one for you .
oh , i win . he &apos;s got barneys on his speed dial .
you don &apos;t know it &apos;s barneys the store .
that could be his friend &apos;s house or a bar ...
who has barneys the store on their speed dial ?
his new girlfriend .
what is that ?
i think it &apos;s the dying cat parade .
sounds like it &apos;s coming from across the street .
oh , my god .
what ?
the thing that ross was gonna do at our wedding ?
he was hanging out with me and said , &quot; you &apos;re half scottish , right ? &quot;
no .
yes !
no . there is no way . it cannot be ross .
unbelievable . why is your family scottish ?
why is your family ross ?
he cannot play at our wedding . everyone will leave .
it &apos;ll be like when he rapped at my bat mitzvah .
we can &apos;t just tell him no . he &apos;s probably been practicing forever . he &apos;ll be crushed .
maybe there &apos;s a way we can tell him without hurting his feelings .
i mean , come on . that is just noise !
it &apos;s not even a song .
wait . if you listen very carefully ...
... i think it &apos;s &quot; celebration &quot; by kool and the gang .
hi . how are you ?
good .
remember when we were in the coffeehouse ...
... we decided i was gonna keep the cute guy &apos;s phone ?
i was gonna keep it in my purse so if it rang , i could just pick it up ?
do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone ?
now you lost me .
you stole the phone .
no , i didn &apos;t .
you &apos;re saying that if i called it , it wouldn &apos;t ring ?
no .
okay .
but while you dial , let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag .
oh , it does work .
phoebe .
that is a different phone .
oh , is it ? hello . yes , hi , is rachel there ?
yes , she is . just one moment , please . it &apos;s for me !
that is damning evidence .
oh , my god . i bet that &apos;s him .
my digital fairy tale &apos;s about to begin .
i wonder how it should be ? should i be , &quot; hello &quot; ?
or should i be , &quot; hi ! it &apos;s ra ... &quot; ?
would you stop doing that ?
hello ? yes , i &apos;m the one who found your phone .
phoebe , you can &apos;t ...
i &apos;m on a call .
yeah , you can pick it up tonight . say , 8 : 30 ?
at my apartment .
it &apos;s 5 morton street , apartment 14 .
and then maybe , you know , after , we can grab a bite to eat or whatever .
okay . okay , i &apos;ll see you then . bye .
you do know that i will be here when he comes over .
how will you know what time to come over ?
you just said it .
well , i was kind of hoping that i would just be alone .
you know , to think about my mom and her suicide .
oh , phoebe !
what ? that &apos;s the first time today .
so you like the nachos , huh ?
myself , i &apos;m partial to ...
i &apos;m 16 .
see you in 2003 .
you &apos;re right . they are writing me out of the show .
they don &apos;t know exactly when it &apos;s going to happen , but soon ...
... and then that &apos;s it .
i &apos;m so sorry . if it was up to me , you would never leave the show .
yeah , thanks .
i mean it .
i can &apos;t believe they &apos;d do this to you . and to your fans .
they &apos;re gonna be devastated . heartbroken . they love you so much .
oh , you &apos;re right .
thank you .
what &apos;s your name again ?
joey .
thank you .
that is so sweet .
excuse me .
it wasn &apos;t my decision .
i &apos;m having a conversation here .
you were saying .
look , the only reason i came up to you before ...
... is because , well ...
... l &apos;m really nervous about being you .
if you could help me capture the essence of the character , you know .
help me keep jessica alive . please ?
all right , joey , i &apos;ll help you .
not because i owe it to this stupid show ...
... but because i owe it to jessica .
oh , that &apos;s great . thank you so much .
you &apos;re so welcome .
i &apos;ve been watching some tapes . how &apos;s this ?
jessica lockhart will never step foot in this place again !
never !
is that supposed to be me ?
yeah .
but jessica doesn &apos;t have an english accent .
i can do an english accent ?
that baby &apos;s going on my resume .
well , i feel like a snack .
do you want some shortbread ? it &apos;s scottish , like you are .
oh , no , thanks . i don &apos;t like anything from my scottish heritage .
what ?
well , it &apos;s just that my entire family was run out of scotland by ...
... vikings .
anyway , lots of bad memories .
it sounds to me like your family &apos;s ready to rediscover its scottish roots .
no . no , they &apos;re not .
they &apos;re still very angry .
but , you know , chandler &apos;s also half @-@ swedish .
you know what the swedish people are famous for ?
sitting down and being quiet .
yeah , but the scottish history is so much ...
you can &apos;t play bagpipes at the wedding !
how did you know about that ?
we heard you play from your apartment .
were you the ones who called the cops ?
that &apos;s not really important right now .
what is important is , while we appreciate the gesture ...
... we just don &apos;t feel that bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding .
why not ?
because we hate them .
come on , that &apos;s not fair . you haven &apos;t even heard me play .
we have heard you play .
no , you &apos;ve heard me practice .
just give me a chance to perform for you , then decide whatever you want .
i &apos;m not gonna tell you what song i &apos;m gonna play either .
let &apos;s just say when it &apos;s over ...
... l &apos;ll bet there &apos;ll be a wee bit of celebration .
the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence .
so when jessica enters a room , for instance ...
... she owns everything ...
... and every person in that room .
you try it .
okay .
all right !
no . he already knows that he owns everything in the room .
he &apos;s not finding it out for the first time .
so try it again .
okay .
he &apos;s not angry at the room either .
try it again . he owns it . he owns the room .
it is his . he owns , owns , owns the room ! he owns it !
it &apos;s a little weird , but it &apos;s getting better .
i &apos;m gonna miss this woman so much . i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do .
it &apos;s been 20 years of my life .
hey , hey . maybe this is a good thing .
it &apos;ll give you a chance to shake things up . play different characters .
you &apos;re so talented .
i am , i am .
but i don &apos;t know . you know ...
... an actor of a certain age , it &apos;s not that easy .
that &apos;s not true . look at angela lansbur ... angelina jolie .
probably should &apos;ve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in ...
... but i just got so comfy here and ...
i turned down some amazing work .
like what ?
well , let &apos;s just say if i &apos;d left 15 years ago ...
... the landscape of mexican cinema would be very different today .
wow .
but , well , now ... now &apos;s a different time for me .
oh , hey , come on . don &apos;t do this .
let me tell you something , okay ?
when i watch you do a scene , i &apos;m thinking , &quot; boy , she is a great actress . &quot;
but i &apos;m also thinking , &quot; she is hot . &quot;
you think i &apos;m hot ?
you own the room .
we should probably get the ...
oh , yeah . yeah , we should get ...
so when jessica kisses a man ...
... she usually puts ...
... both her hands on the man &apos;s face .
i notice that . is that because she &apos;s so passionate ?
no , it &apos;s because that way the camera only sees her .
you want to try it ?
yeah , okay .
that was good . that was really good .
but i think that maybe your hands are just a little off . they should be right ...
hey , hey !
who is it ?
it &apos;s tom . i &apos;m here to pick up the phone .
why do you get to answer the door ?
why shouldn &apos;t i ?
because it &apos;s my apartment .
then i get to give him the cell phone .
okay . good luck explaining all the calls to china .
hi .
wow , how long were we arguing for ?
you &apos;re not the man who left the phone .
no , that &apos;s my assistant .
is he coming ?
no .
could you give us one second ?
sure .
we &apos;ll be right back , sir .
what do we do ?
i don &apos;t know .
can you believe this ?
we were waiting for a hot guy , and then an even hotter one shows up .
i know .
what ?
they just don &apos;t make them like that anymore , you know ?
no , they do , but you just have to wait .
rachel , listen ...
... if you let me have him , then i will really owe you one .
all right .
all right , i will let you have him .
but you owe me . you owe me big .
yeah . you &apos;re such a great friend .
which one of you lovely ladies am i taking to dinner ?
oh , that &apos;d be me , sir .
after you .
oh , thank you .
nice .
well , you certainly own that room .
actually , i rent the whole place . i just got what you meant . thank you .
hi .
hey .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
oh , jessica lockhart ! in my apartment !
i am such a huge fan . i am such a huge fan .
it &apos;s nice to know ...
monica !
that &apos;s my roommate , rachel .
that explains all the womers underwear .
sure .
oh , my god , it &apos;s true !
oh , my god , you are so amazing .
can i just ask you to do me just one favor ?
certainly .
would you slap me right here in the face ?
i &apos;d love to , but my lawyer said i can &apos;t do that anymore .
god , you seem really , really nice .
okay , bye @-@ bye .
i mean , not fake at all like most famous people .
all right , here we go .
no , wait . just one more thing .
you &apos;re a stupid bitch .
i really can &apos;t slap you .
you are so beautiful .
so nice to meet you .
my god , you &apos;re great .
thanks for stopping by .
i am so sorry about that .
oh , no .
being adored , i &apos;m used to it . don &apos;t worry about it .
oh , my god .
what ?
they sent me today &apos;s script . they never send me the script .
they don &apos;t ?
i &apos;m just in a coma .
this must mean i have lines .
how does it happen ?
you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence .
a what ? jessica hates horses .
after this , she &apos;s not gonna be crazy about electricity either .
now , remember , you have to imagine me in a kilt .
i can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks .
you wanna start telling secrets ?
no .
now , remember ...
... l &apos;m still learning .
one , two , three , four !
you know the song . sing along .
so ?
no .
no .
loosening the saddle on mother &apos;s horse was brilliant , fredrick .
and the electric fence , inspired .
thank you , sweetheart .
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s really gone .
look around you . all of this is ours .
i don &apos;t think so .
who are you ?
what &apos;s the matter , dina ?
don &apos;t you recognize your own ...
... mother ?
cut ! that was great , everybody . thank you .
that was so wonderful !
i think that you &apos;re a better jessica than i ever was .
oh , no .
of course not , but you were good .
thanks .
good news . i got another job .
great . hey , all right ! what is it ?
a film in guadalajara .
the airport ?
no , that &apos;s laguardia .
this is mexico .
oh , wow .
well , how long will you be gone ?
eight months .
that &apos;s a really long time .
yeah , but you could come and visit .
i bet that you could own a few places down there .
oh , you know , i should probably buy a place in the city first .
and i just got what you meant . that is ...
that &apos;s a tricky one .
it &apos;s tricky .
joey , i really want to thank you .
you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful .
good luck .
