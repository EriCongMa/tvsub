say you &apos;re in the o.r ...
repairing a vena cava ,
when suddenly , everything goes to hell ...
i think we should practice our statements to the judge .
i think you should stop worrying about it and relax .
i could help you with that .
derek , we have 36 hours before we have to
convince a judge that we &apos;re zola &apos;s parents .
we are zola &apos;s parents .
but they don &apos;t know that .
and for all they know , we ...
hate children .
we feed cute little kittens to a dog
we keep in the backyard .
meredith .
i &apos;m just saying , they don &apos;t know us .
all we have to do is just stand up there
and speak from the heart .
that &apos;s all the convincing they &apos;ll need .
okay ?
okay .
so you cut this , suture that ...
and soon that crappy situation is a thing of the past .
hey .
i missed you this morning . is everything okay ?
yeah . i just wanted to get a run in before work .
okay . well , uh , i gotta get upstairs
if i &apos;m gonna beat shepherd to rounds ,
so i &apos;ll see you later ?
too bad you can &apos;t meet all of life &apos;s challenges
with a surgical scalpel .
yeah .

dr. bailey ,
i &apos;ve been going over this islet cell data .
and i think that-- dr. bailey ?
are we not going to the mouse lab today ? because i--
we &apos;ve got bigger things to worry about than mice , grey .
like , um ...
guinea pigs ?
are your feet as quick as your wit ?
move &apos; em .
ooh , sorry , karev .
i &apos;m gonna need your esophageal atresia .
what ?
oh , and you have a pyloric stenosis .
i might need that one , too .
what are you--why ?
well , &apos; cause we have a prospective peds fellow
coming in today ,
and she &apos;s being courted by all the big guns--
u.s.c , johns hopkins , c.h.o.p.--
and--and hunt asked me to help to make sure
she got the red @-@ carpet tour ,
and that includes scrubbing in on a couple of surgeries .
wait .
you &apos;re already meeting people for the fellowship ?
well , it &apos;s a little early ,
but when someone with polly preston &apos;s resume
wants to observe in your hospital , you make time .
justine , these three bubble @-@ like spots .
those are your aneurysms .
j @-@ j @-@ just a second .
um , sorry .
i didn &apos;t hear a word . say again .
ah . my aneurysms .
horrible things .
what are they doing now , growing ?
is that why the god @-@ awful headaches ?
one has sprung a leak .
great .
go ahead . say it .
say &quot; i told you so . &quot;
he &apos;s been warning me about this for years ,
and i have been avoiding this surgery .
fine .
okay .
but it &apos;s gonna have to wait until i &apos;m done with my book .
dr. grey , what are the possible consequences
of not fixing a warning leak ?
stroke , hemorrhage , death .
dr. grey , what are the possible consequences
for a botched clip ?
stroke , hemorrhage , death .
so i &apos;m dead , and my book &apos;s not finished .
i can &apos;t do that to my readers .
i just need to find a way to get kate to the bridge
where she &apos;s supposed to meet nathan
before she &apos;s pulled back in time .
after that , i &apos;m all yours .
justine--
yeah , between your voice and my leaky aneurysm ,
i &apos;m having a bitch of a time focusing , so ...
could you ...
please ?
when i say this is a very important patient ,
i mean , she is very important to me .
i do not like it , but i have a very full schedule today ,
and you will have to be my proxy .
no one touches this patient but you .
you will run every test i ask for .
you will report every result back to me personally .
this woman has lost a husband and a son in this hospital .
i will not have another o &apos;malley lost under this roof .
o &apos;malley ? george &apos;s mother is our v.i.p. ?
meredith grey .
as promised .
it &apos;s been so long .
oh , you come over here and give me a hug .
this is so freaking cool .
i bet it never occurred to you
to put this on your wish list .
how &apos;s that coming , by the way ?
why ? do you need it today ?
because i can &apos;t-- um , i &apos;m not done .
you do get that this is supposed to be fun , right ?
right . i need more time .
um , do you mind , um , just ...
moving more to your left , please ?
your husband &apos;s in the gallery .
i know .
henry &apos;s been begging for a ride @-@ along .
i figured , if you &apos;re gonna observe a surgery ,
this is the one you want to see .
how are we doing , dr. park ?
just a few more minutes ,
and my guy down at u.c.l.a.
will have the heart he &apos;s been waiting on for over a year .
okay .
let &apos;s roll .
got it .
make sure that connection is secure .
this tube connects directly to the aorta .
that &apos;s right , and this tube removes waste .
got it .
dr. park , your hospital &apos;s on the line .
look at that .
she &apos;s about to catch a flight to l.a.
and not even know she left the body .
damn it .
what is it ?
my guy arrested .
they weren &apos;t able to resuscitate .
he &apos;s dead ?
damn it .
it &apos;s all dressed up , and no place to go .
here . let me get it .
it says here you &apos;ve had surgery three weeks ago
at seattle pre. for a gallbladder removal ?
i &apos;ve gone back there a couple of times ,
and they always tell me i &apos;m fine and send me back home .
uh , bring me a 20 @-@ gauge just in case ,
and benzoin .
and , you know , it &apos;s freezing in here .
have someone take a look at that thermostat .
yes , doctor .
i &apos;m going to palpate your abdomen ,
and you let me know if you feel any discomfort , okay ?
the boys insisted i do my surgery somewhere else ,
after what happened here with harold and ...
and georgie .
she &apos;s got some midepigastric tenderness .
we should check that gallbladder .
uh , have you been experiencing any fevers at all , louise ?
any pain , uh , vomiting ?
yes , actually , i have .
mrs. o &apos;malley , those aren &apos;t good things .
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just that ... look at you .
you know how proud it makes me to have you as my doctor ?
thank you .
grey , let &apos;s get a c.t. , c.b.c. , lytes ,
and a liver panel ,
and let &apos;s get another couple of blankets .
i kept hearing georgie &apos;s voice saying ,
&quot; mom , get a second opinion .
go to seattle grace . they &apos;ll take care of you . &quot;
we will , louise .
we &apos;re gonna take very good care of you .
a doctor .
you &apos;re all grown up .
looks like columbia &apos;s got a good match
who &apos;s already consented .
we &apos;re contacting them now to arrange pick @-@ up ,
but it will be hours before they arrive .
in the meantime , her vitals need to be monitored
and lactate levels checked hourly .
okay , so i &apos;ll find an intern to babysit .
oh , i , uh , i &apos;m not leaving her with an intern .
you &apos;re not serious .
dr. yang , this is a beating heart in a box .
i &apos;m very serious .
and you need more time
to finish your wish list anyway .
right ?
page if you need me .
shepherd , i can &apos;t approve this .
i &apos;m not asking your approval .
i &apos;m giving you a heads @-@ up , as a courtesy .
ah , i have to be at a board meeting .
well , don &apos;t let me hold you up .
yikes . these are intense .
are these patients of yours ?
they will be .
i went looking for patients
who were told &quot; no &quot; by every doctor they &apos;ve seen .
so what are you gonna do ?
tell them &quot; yes . &quot;
tell them i will do my best .
it &apos;s not just me . it &apos;s you , too .
you ready ?
me ?
i ...
y @-@ yes , of course .
what &apos;s this ?
justine campbell &apos;s , a.m.a. forms .
she &apos;s leaving against medical advice so--
oh , so you &apos;re not ready .
what ? why ?
yes . we &apos;re saying yes .
if you can &apos;t get her to say yes
to a simple surgery that will save her life ,
how do you expect to tackle that ?
tear those up .
get her to say yes , and i &apos;ll let you jump on one of these .
okay ? what do you say ?
yes .
damn right .
come on . tell me i &apos;m paranoid or something .
you &apos;re paranoid .
thank you .
although , she did throw a softball at his girlfriend .
i know . screw this .
you know , i can &apos;t be around sloan today . i ...
just take me off plastics , just for the day .
i gotta clear my head .
i am not gonna rearrange the whole surgical schedule
just &apos; cause you &apos;re having girl problems .
just suck it up .
you guys ever hear of a polly preston ?
chief resident at the brigham ?
she &apos;s only my number one peer role model .
you &apos;re a freak , and i hate you .
what are you working on today , karev ?
a fat lot of nothing now . why ?
how would you feel about a nerve graft ?
i would feel great about a nerve graft .
fine .
thank you .
the pain &apos;s getting worse ?
does it look like it &apos;s getting better ?
i know what can really help .
what ?
clipping your aneurysm .
cute .
look , i &apos;m sure if you call your publishers
and you tell them , they &apos;ll extend the deadline .
it is not about a deadline .
it &apos;s about my readers out there ,
who are waiting for me to finish a series
that they have been following for ten years .
you &apos;re really that popular ?
you really know how to kick a girl in the ego , don &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
we don &apos;t get a lot of time to read around here .
what about your family ?
i @-@ i mean , i &apos;m--i &apos;m sure that they wouldn &apos;t want--
do you see any family sitting with me , dr. grey ?
i &apos;m a writer .
my characters are my family ,
and i care about them .
and i &apos;ve managed to make a lot of other people
care about them as well .
yes , i want to give my readers closure .
but kate and nathan and alexander ,
i owe them closure .
and i &apos;m the only one who can give it to &apos; em .
i &apos;m just trying to help you .
you want to help me ?
yeah .

altman is offering to track down
surgeries i want to perform .

oh , no . this is--
thanks .
let &apos;s see what we got here .
yang , what &apos;s wrong with you ?

get creative .
i mean , i mean , look--look at that .
okay .

i &apos;ll see you later ...
dr. torres .
imagine my surprise ...
when i check out the schedule expecting to see
jackson avery &apos;s name on it ,
only to find he &apos;s been replaced by alex karev .
we &apos;ve been preparing this nerve graft for weeks .
i know .
i mean , it &apos;s just you and me .
the plastics posse ...
kicking surgical ass and taking names .
the plastics posse ?
ah , just something i &apos;m trying out .
look , dr. sloan , the thing is ,
i gotta get this paper in by 7 : 00 tonight
or i am screwed .
it &apos;s just bad timing .
wait .
you &apos;re missing a rock @-@ star nerve graft for a paper ?
i know . it &apos;s fifth year .
you know ? i can &apos;t slack off now , right ?
oh , hey , dr. torres .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i panicked .
i didn &apos;t mean to introduce you as dr. robbins .
but i guess i didn &apos;t know how to say ,
&quot; hey , guess what , mama o &apos;malley ,
i &apos;m into girls now , and , uh , oh ,
and this is my wife . &quot;
you know ?
polly .
yes , dr. robbins .
i &apos;m gonna need a minute .
sure thing .
i &apos;m gonna go take a look at your nuclear protein machines .
okay .
peds prospect polly ?
yep .
oh , i &apos;m doing so well today .
i get it . it &apos;s okay .
wait . really ?
&apos;cause you seemed kind of pissed .
really ? i thought i was being funny .
oh , well , then you suck at jokes .
oh . hey , look , coming out is important .
it &apos;s everything .
with your family and your friends ,
i &apos;d kick your ass if you tried to hide me from them .
but coming out to your dead ex @-@ husband &apos;s super catholic mom ?
not necessary . i mean , not for you .
and certainly not for me . so it &apos;s okay .
thank you .
okay . i &apos;m gonna go , find polly
&apos;cause i have no idea
where we &apos;d keep the nuclear protein machines .
excuse me .
sloan will not shut up about you .
i wouldn &apos;t have taken the surgery
if i knew i was breaking up the plastics posse .
he &apos;s using that in public now ?
what ? you &apos;re lucky .
i wish i had an attending
who had my back like sloan &apos;s got yours .
excuse me .
hey , no cuts .
oh , sorry . i just gotta get back to my patient .
oh , my god . you guys should read this .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s amazing .
oh , wait .
is that one of those books about the time @-@ traveling chick ?
yeah , every other mom in peds has got one in her purse .
&apos;cause they &apos;re awesome .
i mean , one minute , kate is running through 1890s paris ,
with this pickpocket that she loves but can &apos;t trust ,
and the next thing she knows , she &apos;s being pulled across time ,
dodging nazis with this adorable american g.i.
it &apos;s like &lt; i &gt; slaughterhouse five &lt; / i &gt; , but totally hot .
&apos;cause that &apos;s what vonnegut &apos;s missing , hotness .
okay , i gotta go .
come on . let &apos;s eat somewhere else .
it &apos;s kind of soothing ,
like sitting in front of a fishtank .
it &apos;s not a fishtank .
it &apos;s a key .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
ask webber .
he came in here , trashing my wish list ,
and told me heart @-@ in @-@ a @-@ box was the key to fixing it .
well , i &apos;ll tell you something , she &apos;s not talking .
heart @-@ in @-@ a @-@ box , what should i put on my wish list ?
heart @-@ in @-@ a @-@ box , what should i put on my sandwich ?
see ? nothing .
heart @-@ in @-@ a @-@ box , what &apos;s wrong with george &apos;s mom ?
who &apos;s george ?
he used to work here . he died .
whoa . who died ?
george .
and we &apos;re talking about that creep because ?
alex , you &apos;re an ass .
his mom &apos;s in the hospital .
wow . o &apos;malley .
i haven &apos;t thought about him in--
why would you ?
alex .
oh , come on . don &apos;t act like you stay up nights
writing poetry about the guy .
remember when you gave him syphilis ?
how ...
what ?
remember heart @-@ in @-@ an @-@ elevator ?
heart @-@ in @-@ an @-@ elevator .
i should put that on my list .
george made you look like such a chump .
george was the heart @-@ in @-@ the @-@ elevator guy ?
i heard about that . that sounded badass .
were you there ?
i just wanted to eat my freakin &apos; lunch . that &apos;s all .
wait . wait .
everyone , shut up .
heart @-@ in @-@ a @-@ box ,
heart @-@ in @-@ an @-@ elevator ?
it works .
it totally works .
webber is a genius .
heart @-@ in @-@ a @-@ box is starting to creep me out .
don &apos;t talk about her that way .
kate looked at alexander
with pity more than anything .
&quot; fine , &quot; she said .
&quot; go . go wherever the hell you want ,
but first , you &apos;re gonna apologize . &quot;
why ?
why what ?
why is he apologizing ?
alexander ?
because he stole the ring that nathan gave her
in book two .
what ? nathan gave her a ring .
yes , he did , in book two .
does alexander know that
nathan gave it to her ?
no , dr. grey , he is a thief .
if a thief sees a ring , he &apos;s gonna take it .
but he promised that he was going to change .
dr. grey .
what ?
i &apos;m doing what you told me to do .
i told you to get her to the o.r ..
you &apos;re hosting a book club .
she won &apos;t go into an o.r. until she finishes her book .
i &apos;m helping her finish .
and how long will that take ?
you can &apos;t rush the creative process .
grey , i asked you for preliminary tests
and hourly reports .
what part of that did you interpret as ,
&quot; also , if you find the time ,
please shove a scope down
mrs. o &apos;malley &apos;s throat &quot; ?
her endoscopic ultrasound
showed a 16 @-@ milimeter dilation of the common duct .
i also did not ask for an endoscopic ultrasound .
see ? why can &apos;t you just do
the things that i ask you to do ?
oh , look . there .
see ? she &apos;s got inflammation
and scar tissue around the remnant cystic duct .
she &apos;s gonna need surgery .
wonderful . you just proved that
your former colleague &apos;s mother
had a botched surgery at another hospital--
a hospital that she only went to
because we let her down
so shamefully in the past .
i just don &apos;t know why you &apos;re celebrating .
i &apos;m not celebrating--
just go prep her for surgery .
or is that too much to ask ?
you were amazing in there .
i mean , from where i was standing ,
it looked like you pretty much rebuilt that guy &apos;s heart .
what do you call that again ?
a modified fontan procedure .
ah , after dr. fontan ?
i can only assume .
well , i can only assume that dr. fontan
never looked as hot doing his own procedure ...
as my wife just did .
what happens in here ?
so the surgeons at seattle pres .
left a length of cystic duct
inside of you when they operated .
that &apos;s what &apos;s causing your problems .
so we &apos;re gonna take that out .
do you have any questions ?
i saw a ring .
excuse me ?
on callie &apos;s finger
when we ran into her earlier .
did she get remarried ?
she did .
a few months ago , actually .
aw . oh , good .
do you think--is she happy ? oh , i hope she &apos;s happy .
she seems happy .
do you have any questions about your surgery ?
i raised a bunch of boys .
it was so nice to finally have a daughter .
i miss her , all of you , really .
george &apos;s friends .
oh , you were so important to him ,
to me .
well , you &apos;re doing exactly what george would be doing--
being in charge .
oh , you &apos;ll be doing my surgery , won &apos;t you , dear ?
all by yourself .
if you &apos;re uncomfortable , i--
oh , no . no , don &apos;t be silly .
george said you were the best .
i &apos;m comfortable .
i &apos;m more than comfortable . i &apos;m--i &apos;m ready .
let &apos;s--let &apos;s do this . let &apos;s cut me open .
i &apos;m gonna need the hand back for the surgery .
avery .
we &apos;re about to get to the hypoglossal nerve .
why don &apos;t you come down here and get a closer look ?
i &apos;d just get in the way .
i can see fine from here .
you &apos;re a fool , avery .
sitting in the gallery
when you should be grafting nerves ?
you &apos;re lost .
adrift .
you know what you need ?
no , sir . i don &apos;t .
you need to see heart @-@ in @-@ a @-@ box .
yeah , i &apos;ve seen it .
maybe you looked at it .
but if you really saw it ,
you &apos;d be down in that o.r. right now .
see it , avery .
see heart @-@ in @-@ a @-@ box .
any idea what &apos;s going on with avery ?
he seems so distant .
you want me to put a note in his locker ?
what &apos;s that ?
you want me to suture in the graft ?
no , i &apos;ll handle that .
hey , what did you find ?
oh , there were retained stones
blocking her cystic duct remnant .
oh , okay . well , that &apos;s not super serious .
she should be okay , right ?
yeah , she &apos;ll be fine .
okay , good . thanks . yeah .
oh , uh , she knows you &apos;re married .
what ?
how ? h @-@ how did she find--
she saw your ring this morning .
she asked me , and all i said is that you were happy .
it &apos;s not your place to say anything .
she &apos;s going into surgery , and she &apos;s scared ,
and she &apos;s alone and she misses you .
i know it &apos;s complicated ,
but i don &apos;t think it would be a bad thing if you were there
to hold her hand when she woke up .
hey , you got a second ?
wait just one second .
i &apos;m a little worried about avery .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m this close to getting this .
we had a real connection , you know ?
okay .
well , we were having such a good time together ,
and suddenly he &apos;s avoiding me .
he &apos;s cold and ... distant .
well , you &apos;re afraid
you &apos;re about to have your heart broken by him .
kind of .
derek , you know me .
i never gave a crap about teaching in my life .
but lately , i like the idea of passing it on .
and i , you know , i just-- i want to see him do well .
maybe i just need to back off .
ah , hunt . just in time .
mark is afraid that avery is gonna break up with him .
can this just stay between you and me ?
i &apos;d prefer that .
uh , shepherd , about these cases--
i know what you &apos;re gonna say .
you &apos;re worried about the hospital &apos;s mortality rate going up .
see , that &apos;s the worst part about being chief .
you have to say no to everybody , and they hate you for it .
and you say no enough ,
you &apos;re gonna hate yourself ,
which is why i &apos;m not gonna watch you go through this .
i have a consult .
if you love someone , set them free .
if they come back ...
i &apos;m gonna punch you .
hey , let me ask you something .
no .
i gotta say , i &apos;m a big fan of what happens in this room .
mm . every day should be ...
bring @-@ your @-@ husband @-@ to @-@ work day .
listen , i &apos;ve had this idea .
i felt silly even considering it .
like , &quot; really ?
y @-@ you think that &apos;s something you &apos;re gonna do ? &quot;
but now , though , i &apos;m thinking i really want to do it .
i want to go back to school .
oh , okay . i mean ...
i mean , that &apos;s not silly .
adults go back to school all the time .
medical school .
wow .
i mean ...
wow .
yeah .
hey , what time is it ?
we got another surgery to get to .
come on . up and at &apos; em .
kate couldn &apos;t keep it to herself any longer .
she took him by the hand
and looked deep into those ocean blue eyes .
&quot; i have figured out why i travel through time , nathan .
i have figured it out , and now i know how i can stop it . &quot;
oh , my god .
&quot; i can choose where to be , when to be .
and i have . i have chosen . &quot;
oh , my god . yes .
nathan pulled her into his arms and held on tightly .
kate whispered against his chest ,
&quot; i &apos;m sorry . i am so , so sorry . &quot;
wait . what ?
she &apos;d never know if he heard her .
when she opened her eyes ,
nathan was gone .
she was in paris .
it was time to look for alexander .
what ?
she chooses alexander ?
no !
no way . it ha-- it has to be nathan .
it &apos;s not nathan .
but he &apos;s--he &apos;s so handsome and good .
and--and alexander--
is her soul mate .
he doesn &apos;t even have a soul .
i mean , he &apos;s a criminal .
they--they--they don &apos;t even want the same things .
they make each other miserable .
dr. grey , i cannot betray my characters--
you &apos;re the writer .
you can make them do whatever you want .
and--and picking nathan ,
that is the right thing to do .
ohh .
you hate it . no , i @-@ i know .
no , no . you hate it .
oh , god .
okay , page shepherd . now .
i think her aneurysm blew .
suction .
oh , damn . it &apos;s a big bleed .
if you had spent less time taking dictation ,
we could &apos;ve avoided this .
did she at least finish the book ?
no ,
but she did tell me how it &apos;s gonna end .
it &apos;s so stupid .
she--she &apos;s written this incredible story
with these amazing characters ,
and then she just blows it .
wow . you &apos;re 15 right now .
it &apos;s criminal , what she &apos;s doing .
and--and when she wakes up ,
i &apos;m gonna tell her that .
or maybe it &apos;s none of your business .
it &apos;s the same thing that you are doing
with these hopeless cases .
you know , you think that you can change
the way the patient &apos;s story is gonna end .
and if you think that ,
then you &apos;re at least obligated to try .
so i gotta try , right ?
yes .
you double @-@ checked her labs and scans ?
yes , of course .
i just don &apos;t want any surprises once i &apos;m in there .
actually , she thought i &apos;d be performing her surgery .
oh , i &apos;m not comfortable with that .
i can do a septoplasty . you taught me a septoplasty .
i thought i taught you a lot of things .
now i &apos;m thinking , i must not be much of a teacher at all .
i &apos;m going to court tomorrow ...
to prove to a judge that &apos;s never met me that i &apos;m a good person ,
a fit mother .
i want my kid back so badly ,
i &apos;m racking my brain for anything
that &apos;ll make him see me that way .
i want to dress the part , so i &apos;m thinking my navy dress .
but there &apos;s a button missing , and it shows too much cleavage .
my charcoal pants have a hole in the ass .
i &apos;ve got one shot at this .
i &apos;m useless ...
and frustrated .
but i know how to do an e.r.c.p. ,
and i know when to double @-@ check labs .
and i know how to do a septoplasty .
i &apos;m not useless here .
fine . do the surgery .
off @-@ pump coronary bypass .
no .
en bloc transplant ,
heart and both lungs .
yes .
i don &apos;t get it .
i mean , webber talks about this thing
like it &apos;s a magic 8 ball .
it &apos;s a heart ...
in a box .
okay , when you take an organ out for transplant ,
what do you do ?
put it on ice .
yeah , you put it on ice
and run to place it in the recipient &apos;s body ,
and then you wait and hope
for this cold , dead heart
to warm up and come back to life , right ?
but she--
she ?
she has never stopped beating .
she &apos;s never stopped being warm ,
never stopped living .
sure , it &apos;s pretty--
it &apos;s a friggin &apos; miracle .
okay ? you &apos;re standing before a miracle .
and once you realize that ,
she &apos;ll change your perspective .
okay , here &apos;s what i do .
i look at an item on my list ,
i look at heart @-@ in @-@ a @-@ box .
and if that surgery on my list
isn &apos;t half as cool as heart @-@ in @-@ a @-@ box ,
then it is not worth my time .
she lets you know what &apos;s most important to you .
that &apos;s what heart @-@ in @-@ a @-@ box does .
and she &apos;s nice to talk ...
shh .
shut up . shut up .
what do you think about the university of washington ?
um , i &apos;m not sure .
it &apos;s not like harvard or stanford . it feels--
i don &apos;t know . it feels doable .
doable ?
okay , i @-@ i--i &apos;m sorry , but ...
medical school isn &apos;t something that you--you--you--
you just decide to do .
really ? how did it happen for you ?
the lady of the lake appeared with a gilded scalpel
and anointed you a med student ?
ha ha .
i &apos;m actually being serious right now .
i mean , how is my decision to go to med school
any different than yours ?
first of all , i was 19 .
all right , great . so i &apos;m old . what else ?
uh , i don &apos;t know .
um , have you taken your three years of prerequisites ?
uh , how about the m @-@ cat ?
no , i have not , but i do have a college degree .
i may have been a baseball player ,
but i think i remember how to study .
okay , that still doesn &apos;t account for
the four years of actual med school .
and--and if you decide to go completely crazy
and you want to try to become a surgeon ,
that &apos;s five years of residency ,
a fellowship--
no , i never s--
i never said i wanted to be a surgeon .
there are plenty of other ways to use a medical education .
okay , fine .
fine .
i love the way things are right now .
i really do .
and i don &apos;t want to spend ten years
married to a med student .
no . you &apos;d just rather i followed you around ,
looking cute .
okay , you know what ?
you--you know that that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying .
i was gonna die .
my disease was going to kill me .
and then i met you .
you came into my life ,
and suddenly i have insurance ,
i have a wife ,
i have a life expectancy beyond the next three months .
sue me if i don &apos;t want to waste any of it .
henry ,
i-- just--
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;ll see you at home .
okay , probe passes easily through the common duct .
one more biopsy , and i think we &apos;re ready to close .
dr. bailey , is there something wrong ?
did i miss something ?
this woman worked so hard
to raise her son , and then ...
one day , he just threw himself in front of a bus .
i mean , yeah , yeah , he did it to save someone else , but ...
you work and work ,
trying to teach your kids to do the right thing ,
and--and you want to be so proud of them
when they stand up for what they believe is right .
but watching them destroy themselves ...
in order to do it , to do what you taught them ,
it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s just maddening .
you . you are maddening .
he was my favorite ...
george o &apos;malley .
he was ...
my favorite .
i know .
he was the good one .
so i &apos;m going to put in a t @-@ tube .
wear a sweater set .
um , people have , uh ,
preconceived notions about surgeons .
they think we &apos;re cold ,
intimidating , egotistical .
a sweater set says you &apos;re warm , motherly .
if it was me , i &apos;d wear a sweater set .
thank you .
hey . you paged ?
i , uh , i can &apos;t get outta here yet .
i gotta follow up with my patient ,
make sure she &apos;s in her right frame of mind .
yeah .
you okay ?
yeah , i just ... i missed a surgery today that ...
that &apos;s not true .
i avoided a surgery today ,
one i wanted to do for weeks .
because of this thing with you and mark .
there is nothing between me and mark .
yeah , i &apos;ve been trying really , really hard to believe that .
but there is a thing .
and it &apos;s not going anywhere anytime soon .
and this new thing with me and plastics ?
that &apos;s not going away either .
something &apos;s gotta budge .
so i have to walk away ...
from you ... for me .
so ...
you &apos;re picking mark ?
i &apos;ve spent way too much time
sabotaging my own career , lex .
yeah ...
i &apos;m picking mark .
can you ...
can you tell me i shouldn &apos;t ?
heard a helicopter touched down on the roof .
let them come .
you were right .
she was the key .
now this is a fine list .
thank you , sir .
you made a list , too ?
i was inspired .
oh , oh , i wish ... i @-@ i want to put this on my list .
if one of those comes in ,
we &apos;ll have to see who gets to it first .
okay .
okay .
hi .
we &apos;re the procurement team from columbia .
she &apos;s all yours .
heart @-@ in @-@ a @-@ box .
hot diggity .
how are you feeling ?
like a woman who just had brain surgery .
fair enough . can you tell me your name ?
justine ... campbell .
and what &apos;s today &apos;s date ?
i never know the date . ask me something else .
why can &apos;t kate choose nathan ?
she &apos;s going to .
i mean , you just feel like you have a moral obligation to ...
wait , really ?
yeah . for now .
i had a dream while i was under , and i figured out
how to stretch the series out two or three more books .
so ... for now ,
she &apos;ll get to see what it feels like to be with nathan .
so ... what ?
they &apos;re gonna be together for a few books ,
and then she &apos;s gonna choose alexander ?
yeah , probably .
what is wrong with you ?
i mean , why do you hate nathan so much ?
i don &apos;t hate nathan .
i love him ,
probably as much as you apparently do .
he &apos;s kind and funny
and incredibly honest .
it &apos;s kate .
she doesn &apos;t love him .
she should .
i know .
it &apos;s not fair .
i know .
but it makes for a really , really good read .
hey .
hey .
come here .
do you want to work on the book a little bit more ?
will that make you feel better ?
okay .
callie .
hey .
meredith said the surgery went great .
oh . yeah .
i like girls .
uh ... as in ... romantically .
it turns out , i like girls .
uh , women .
and i met the most amazing woman .
do @-@ do you remember dr . robbins from this morning ?
yeah , we got married , and , uh ,
oh , no , but before that , we , um ...
we got in an accident , a car accident ,
a really bad accident , and , uh , i almost died .
but i didn &apos;t , and , uh , sofia ...
neither did sofia , our @-@ our baby ...
our perfect , beautiful baby .
and i &apos;m , um ...
i &apos;m ...
screwing all this up .
look , i ...
i know this is a lot .
and i @-@ and i understand .
um , and if this is too much for you to handle ,
believe me ...
my own mother practically disowned me ,
so i understand .
oh , god . i &apos;m making you cry .
please don &apos;t cry .
you have a baby ?
i @-@ i do .
do you have any pictures ?
you want to see &apos; em ?
are you kidding ?
okay .
oh .
oh , she &apos;s beautiful .
thank you .
that man just booked a flight from wichita .
you want to tell him no , i &apos;ll give you his number .
you can tell him yourself .
i &apos;m not worried about
the hospital &apos;s mortality rates , derek .
mm . i &apos;m worried about you .
you &apos;ve had a lot of losses this year ,
and i am concerned that you &apos;re lining yourself up for more .
you &apos;re worried about my reputation .
well , there is that .
i don &apos;t have a reputation anymore .
see , i was gonna be the guy who cured alzheimer &apos;s .
now i am blacklisted by the fda ,
so i don &apos;t have to worry about that anymore .
i get to choose what i worry about .
and i choose them .
i feel i can change their story .
i owe it to them to at least try .
that &apos;s ...
pretty damned arrogant , don &apos;t you think ?
well , i have a reputation for arrogance .
could i have a cabernet ?
actually , make that a scotch and soda .
okay .
you know what ? forget the soda .
hi , it &apos;s me .
turns out today was a bust .
she kept going on about this guy
who helped these kids in africa .
and i was like , &quot; have you seen my three articles ? &quot;
but apparently , this guy raps puppies ,
so who cares about me ?
anyway , my plane lands at 10 : 00,
so wait up .
i &apos;m gonna be drunk .
and i &apos;m gonna cry .
just warning you .
i have to catch a plane .
keep the change . thanks .
avery , wait up .
oh , right , dr. sloan .
you need to talk to me .
i am sorry about today ...
no , i &apos;m sorry .
it was my ...
no , you don &apos;t have anything to be sorry about .
no , i think i should apologize to you for ...
no , it wasn &apos;t you .
it was me . i have been ...
i just think we had some ...
i don &apos;t want to screw things up .
okay , i &apos;m gonna talk , then you talk , okay ?
okay .
i want to be your teacher .
i want to be your student .
i have a cranial vault reconstruction tomorrow .
i will be there .
good .
good .
great .
i guess the ...
plastics posse is back in action .
kicking surgical ass and taking names .
oh . just ... all right .
just do that . yeah .
great .
okay .
all right .
drive safe .
it &apos;s a little bit horrifying
just how quickly everything can fall to crap .
o &apos;malley wasn &apos;t a creep , okay ?
if he were here now , he &apos;d be kicking all of our asses .
he would &apos;ve slapped chief resident right out of kepner &apos;s hand .
i just don &apos;t like thinking about him
because then i have to think about izzie ,
and then i get all sad and sappy and ...
i totally miss the chance to nail hot , drunk chicks
who spent the day thinking about how i &apos;m awesome
which i should be all about .
george is dead , and izzie is gone ,
and we &apos;re all different .
we &apos;re different .
sometimes it takes a huge loss
to remind you of what you care about the most .
sometimes you find yourself becoming stronger as a result ,
wiser , better equipped to deal with
the next big disaster that comes along .
hey .
that was our first real fight .
you okay ?
okay , okay , okay , okay . it &apos;s okay .
okay . you &apos;re gonna be okay .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
sometimes ...
look at me .
you &apos;re gonna be okay .
but not always .
