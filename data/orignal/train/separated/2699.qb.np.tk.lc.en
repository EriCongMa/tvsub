a patient of yours .
gloria trillo .

why not ? she &apos;s smart , she &apos;s sexy , she &apos;s italian .
italian ?
you stick to your own kind , you know .

maybe she reminds me of you .
okay .
how ?
smart . sexy . she &apos;s italian .
she &apos;s actually nothing like you .
well ...
... maybe a little .
who else ?
you both got great legs .
keep joking .

it &apos;s your fault we met .
the scheduling mix @-@ up ?
point is , she makes me happy .
does she seem happy to you ?
when she &apos;s with me . and you know what ? so am i.
is lying to carmela in therapy the best thing for your panic attacks ?
things are good between us , you said so .
it &apos;s predicated on a lie .
predicate it on my ass , what &apos;s the difference ? i &apos;m content , i &apos;m relaxed .
bottom line is , i &apos;m a better husband and father .
you wanna know the truth , as much as i love my wife ...
