no hello ?
hi .
this is all just an elaborate plan to get me alone , isn &apos;t it ?
you found me out .
we &apos;re redoing the floors .
it &apos;s her .
you &apos;ll have to turn off cell phones and beepers .
they expect me on call .
we &apos;ll be 20 minutes at the most .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re doing this .
we could still turn back .
i love you .
we &apos;re redoing the floors .
okay , i &apos;ll start .
due to agency @-@ wide budget cuts , the fbi has
to be very selective with its federal witness protection monies .
you have our proffer .
yes . uh , very elegantly put .
unfortunately , for my purposes , i &apos;ll need more specificity .
jack arkin is
part of a joint task force with the cook county sheriff &apos;s office .
he witnessed and was pressured to participate in illegal activities
by other members of his drug task force .
some of these activities crossed state lines .
he is willing to help the fbi bring these corrupt cops to justice ...
and save his own ass .
okay , maybe this was a mistake .
all right , all right .
i understand internal affairs is investigating this task force .
why don &apos;t i just let them do their work ?
because the state &apos;s attorney wants to be reelected .
he &apos;s not gonna let an investigation
of his pet project become an embarrassment .
and what about the people in this room who could benefit
from such an embarrassment ?
i &apos;ll step out .
no . the arkins came to you ; it &apos;s your case .
if you wouldn &apos;t mind ,
mrs. florrick , i think it &apos;s better to avoid any appearance of a conflict .
giada . alicia , right ?
yes . are you waiting for someone ?
yeah , will . they told me i could wait down here .
oh . uh , he &apos;ll be a while .
oh , that &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re a friend from college , right ?
of will &apos;s ? yes .
depaul , third year .
oh , you &apos;re in law school .
he talks a lot about you ; almost makes me jealous .
don &apos;t be .
j. k.
just kidding .
nice meeting you .
that &apos;s hunter .
he set up the drop house for the stash .
that &apos;s brad .
he stashes the meth .
and , uh , foley , he moves the guns .
you have proof ?
and where &apos;s this ?
mr. arkin , at some risk to his own life ,
took photos of the task force &apos;s drop house ,
and he will gladly share the location upon receipt of an immunity deal .
you said there were other corrupt cops involved , mr. arkin .
if you could study these photos from these other busts .
i don &apos;t know his name , but ... him ,
him ...
... and him .
him ?
yeah .
okay . i &apos;ll need a week to brief my superiors ,
and then we can work out the details .
you &apos;re late .
yep .
you &apos;re unhappy .
no .
i &apos;m drinking .
tony , you know this stuff you &apos;re slipping me ,
crime reports and evidence ?
you ever worry about getting caught ?
getting caught ?
slipping you things ?
no !
no . why ?
just part of doing business .
yeah . i mean , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s for a friend .
some things you do for a friend .
i feel like you &apos;re having this conversation with yourself , and ...
and i &apos;m just listening in .
no , i &apos;m just ... i &apos;m just figuring you out , that &apos;s all .
no , the only problem was that jackie got a pinata .
so we all went outside in the middle of a rainstorm .
and swinging bats at a pinata .
okay , where was i ? why haven &apos;t i heard about this ?
oh , and grandma was worried about us using baseball bats .
so she made everyone use these little wooden spoons .
my wild and wacky family .
you &apos;re stuck with us .
for your first free meal , you choose obbie &apos;s ?
ray .
ray ernesto , hey !
honey , this is ray ernesto ,
and he works for the mayor &apos;s office .
my children .
hi , kids .
just wanted to say that rich is a big fan , pete , always has been ,
and he &apos;d love to show his support .
i &apos;d love it ,
but tell me you gotta leave that dinosaur , tolins &amp; brauer ,
come talk to my wife about her firm .
oh , that &apos;s right , you &apos;re at , um ...
lockhart / gardner .
yeah , we just might look you over .
oh , pete , uh ...
&quot; pe @-@ pete &quot; ?
keep eating .
yeah .
&quot; pete &quot; ?
so what &apos;d he say ?
he said that , uh ,
childs &apos; days are numbered .
wow , you &apos;re big @-@ time now .
i &apos;m just the flavor of the week .
he &apos;ll be telling the same thing to childs tomorrow .
anything else i can get you ?
uh , no , we &apos;re good . thank you
so do you like it ?
do i like what ?
stuff , politics .
um , i don &apos;t know .
i like what it can do .
i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s work .
hello .
no , thanks .
i &apos;m sorry ...
no dessert .
what &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s my client .
00 , officer down at 373 elmer driver .
hey , lady , stop !
... 00 , officer down .
all available units reporting to ...
hey , kalinda , you can &apos;t be here .
what happened ?
out .
out , and i &apos;ll tell you .
dispatch , we got an officer down .
jack arkin &apos;s down . i repeat , jack arkin ...
we raided this meth house , and the shot came out of nowhere .
top of the stairs .
meth dealer named gorman .
we &apos;d been following him around for six months .
traded fire , we took him down .
why was jack through the door alone ?
he wasn &apos;t through the door alone . we were there .
just not fast enough , right ?
you excuse me for a second ?
i &apos;m sorry , are you really blaming me for this leak ?
within 24 hours of our proffer , our client was dead .
yes , and we &apos;re very saddened ,
but we can still get these corrupt cops off the street .
by giving you the stash location ?
unfortunately , he never gave the location to us .
okay .
let &apos;s just chalk this up as a bad first date .
i &apos;m sorry to ask you this now ,
but you know our firm wants to file suit against cook county
and the city of chicago for wrongful death ?
yeah , they phoned .
i just don &apos;t want anyone to think i &apos;m profiting from this .
we worry internal affairs will bury this
&apos;cause it &apos;s embarrassing to the state &apos;s attorney .
give us a chance to investigate it .
by bringing a lawsuit ?
yeah .
so you think i should do this ?
i think bureaucracies are often prompted to action by the threat of money .
the task force was targeting meth labs .
their story is that arkin came through the door first ,
and then was shot by a meth dealer , randy gorman .
arkin ended up on his back here .
then the rest of the task force returned fire , killing gorman .
but there &apos;s an inconsistency .
lab found jack &apos;s blood mixed with his saliva
exactly two feet from the body here .
suggesting ?
that he fell face @-@ first onto the landing ,
then someone flipped him over onto his back .
it was staged .
we &apos;ll need ballistics .
i &apos;m on it .
okay , so our story is this :
the task force discovered jack was gonna testify ,
killed gorman ,
then used gorman &apos;s gun to kill jack .
yeah .
let &apos;s finish this off in depositions .
cook county won &apos;t want this in the press .
you &apos;re hot on this .
i &apos;m friends with a lot of cops .
the bad ones hurt the good ones .
so , this is a crusade ?
it &apos;s a job .
and a job i &apos;ll do well .
notice i &apos;m here as an invited guest
now that i &apos;m a client of your firm .
yes .
welcome .
do you mind if i &apos;m blunt , mrs. florrick ?
always a pleasure .
i brought my business here . i didn &apos;t have to .
do you mind if i &apos;m blunt , mr. gold ?
you brought your business here because we &apos;re a good firm .
and let &apos;s both agree on one thing right now--
there &apos;s a statute of limitations on playing that card .
fair enough .
this is mimi collins ,
a 24 @-@ year @-@ old art student at whitley .
two years ago , she was raped and brutally beaten
by her ex @-@ boyfriend , a michael placedo .
well , if this is a criminal matter ,
mr. gold , you can take it upstairs .
no . it &apos;s more of an allegory .
placedo was sentenced to 20 years in prison
by the state &apos;s attorney at the time-- your husband .
mimi collins went back to college ,
a happy , healthy coed with nothing to fear .
somehow , i feel this will end badly .
glenn childs , in a general review of your husband &apos;s cases ,
argued that placedo be released with time served .
that is mimi collins &apos; body--
found two weeks ago in a chicago landfill .
looks like your first ad campaign .
it would be ...
if it weren &apos;t for the fact that peter has decided to wait four years to run .
really ?
he said that at dinner with you and the kids ,
he was worried about the &quot; seductive allure of power . &quot;
mr. gold ,
who does the &quot; seductive allure of power &quot; sound like to you ?
that &apos;s right .
the good pastor , isaiah .
i need you to talk to him .
he thinks he &apos;s trying to restore your marriage .
tell him you don &apos;t need that .
always good to see you , mr. gold .
peter can &apos;t win without you .
you know that .
peter only wins with your good housekeeping seal of approval .
voters need to see you together
up on that stage holding hands .
good @-@ bye , mr. gold .
mr. gorman got off three rapid shots
on the task force lead man , your client , mr. arkin .
all hit their target-- center , two high , one low .
and this matches the crime scene ?
no . my stairwell &apos;s two steps taller .
i &apos;ve adjusted by lowering the c @-@ stand .
now , mr. arkin fell as he was firing here on the landing ,
while another member of the task force
rushed in and fired three shots from here .
you all right ?
yes .
what does it say about me that i find this exhilarating ?
you &apos;re human .
and are we saying that the task force
then planted a drop gun on mr. gorman , or , uh ... or was it his ?
it was his .
well , so how did this ...
i mean , are you saying ...
you &apos;re saying it happened the way the police said ?
yes .
it wasn &apos;t staged ?
that &apos;s correct .
and the ...
and the blood and saliva stain ?
you don &apos;t think mr. arkin was flipped over onto his back ?
no . my guess is that , in the extremity of the moment ,
one of mr. arkin &apos;s partners
turned him on his back to check his vitals ,
and they failed to report this during the investigation .
you seem to accord the police a great deal of honesty .
i do .
and you brought me out here to , what ?
your firm asked me to examine the evidence .
well , we &apos;ve asked you that before , and you just said no .
that &apos;s true .
it &apos;s because of my feelings for you
that i &apos;ve shown you this .
i won &apos;t bill you for the effort .
your feelings for me ?
i was approached by the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
to argue against our lawsuit ?
yes .
i declined .
i think you should do what you want , kurt .
i think you should testify for the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
i wouldn &apos;t hesitate to argue against you .
let me think about it .
i &apos;ll go get my purse .
yo ...
so , here we are .
dinner .
and i &apos;m treating .
damn right , you are .
i ran into alicia florrick .
uh @-@ huh . where ?
at the office . she seems nice .
yes , and a very talented lawyer .
i &apos;m sure .
i felt like i was intruding .
you felt like you were intruding ?
i don &apos;t understand that .
i felt like i was getting checked out by someone who had skin in the game .
senorita cabrini .
he likes you .
i &apos;m so glad .
you want me to translate ?
i understood every word .
so , do you come here a lot ?
my dad does .
your dad ? who @-@ who &apos;s your dad ?
if i tell you , you , uh , promise not to freak out ?
okay , not only do you have to tell me now ,
but nothing could top that introduction .
ernesto cabrini .
i don &apos;t know who that ...
wait , i do know who that is .
he &apos;s the fourth richest man in europe , right ?
third , not that we &apos;re counting .
so , men freak out about that ?
only the ones who are uncomfortable
with their own masculinity . yeah .
si , senor .
what &apos;s your most expensive bottle of wine ?
so , there &apos;s no pressure in this .
it &apos;s just a deposition .
they &apos;re polite and uncomplicated .
they &apos;re just going to want basic information .
no one &apos;s trying to score points .
thank you .
that &apos;s good . all right , good .
cary , everything all right ?
alicia . hi . how are you ?
um ... i &apos;m fine .
how are you ?
i &apos;m good , too .
are you ...
do you have a meeting with will ?
no .
did you talk to reception ?
no . i &apos;m here for you .
for me ?
yes , the deposition .
i &apos;m working with glenn childs now .
hi .
how much money did your husband make last year ?
uh ... last year ?
uh , i don &apos;t know .
my guess would be $ 55,000 .
and is it true that you took a vacation in antigua last february ?
yes .
do you remember how much it cost ?
no .
$ 8,545 and change .
that , ma &apos;am , is over 15 % of your husband &apos;s yearly salary .
i work , too .
yeah , part @-@ time as a nurse .
that &apos;s an additional 23 grand a year .
just to save you time ,
cary , we would stipulate
to mr. arkin &apos;s involvement in the task force &apos;s corruption .
yes .
thank you , mrs. florrick .
i know that you would stipulate , but i &apos;m looking to itemize .
now , let &apos;s turn to your domestic dispute charges against your husband .
cute of the state &apos;s attorney .
shows some unexpected wit .
cary &apos;s a good lawyer .
you think we made the wrong decision ?
not necessarily .
let &apos;s see how well he does against us .
what &apos;s cary doing here ?
working for the opposition .
smart .
he &apos;s drawing blood , too .
look , i have some thoughts about finding this secret stash .
good . that could help us with a settlement .
keep us informed .
mr. daley called .
said he wanted to call peter before ,
but he was too busy .
i knew exactly what he ...
would you excuse me a second ?
looking for a miss ...
mr. , uh ... what was it again ?
goldman ?
gold .
mrs. florrick , hello .
i thought you might be able to help me with a little problem .
well , this isn &apos;t really the place .
yes . unfortunately , this is a time @-@ sensitive matter regarding your son .
peter is questioning
whether to wait four years before running .
no , he &apos;s not .
i &apos;m sorry-- he is .
and if we don &apos;t file by the end of the week ,
we &apos;ll be forced to wait four years .
you &apos;re not lying ?
no .
sorry-- i wish i were .
pastor isaiah talked to him .
who introduced him to this pastor ?
i did , but not with that intention .
mr. gold , there is one thing you need to know about my son .
he is easily moved .
you need to prescreen the people who see him .
and i will talk to this man .
plan on making the announcement by the end of the week .
thank you .
are you good , mr. gold ?
am i good ?
uh , i &apos;m the best , ma &apos;am .
i will need you to be .
shalom .
objection .
plaintiff &apos;s counsel has an ongoing relationship with the expert witness .
that seems more like a reason you shouldn &apos;t hire him
than i shouldn &apos;t question him .
i &apos;m preserving my objection for trial .
mr. mcveigh ,
on tuesday last , did you conduct an experiment
duplicating the april 16th officer shooting ?
i did .
and this experiment was conducted at your farm ?
it was .
in your barn ?
yes .
and this experiment led to
your conclusion that the police investigation was accurate ?
that &apos;s correct .
are you familiar with the fbi standards for ballistic investigation ?
i am .
was this investigation in your barn in accordance with those standards ?
in most respects .
so , in some respects , it wasn &apos;t ?
that would follow .
so that would be a yes ?
you are correct .
the assailant &apos;s firearm was lowered through the use of a c @-@ stand ?
yes .
and the fbi standards caution
that a c @-@ stand is not a steady base for a firearm ?
i believe that &apos;s correct .
you believe ?
yes , i believe .
well , then let &apos;s move on .
in what other ways do your home @-@ spun
investigative methods clash with fbi standards ?
do you need a minute , mr. mcveigh ?
i &apos;m sorry .
what are you looking for ?
these cell phone photos leave a date and time .
there .
saturday , march 13 .
how does that help you ?
do you have your credit card bills ?
i need to get into a storage locker .
see how much fun it is being a fed .
24 @-@ hour court orders .
thank you .
thanks .
here we go .
who you calling ?
lockhart / gardner .
something on your mind ?
let me see your phone .
why ?
i want to see who you &apos;re phoning .
no .
why ?
because i don &apos;t like to be questioned .
mr. arkin said there were three other corrupt cops ,
so we immediately put them under surveillance .
this is you with a detective anthony burton
two hours after our proffer ,
one hour before mr. arkin was murdered .
and here you are ...
ten minutes later in his car .
so ?
so , kalinda ...
there were only five of us in that room for that proffer ,
and one of us leaked .
oh , so that &apos;s why these photos are so important .
this one of me in the car .
&apos;cause it shows me ... leaking .
it shows you in a compromised position .
with a man .
with a corrupt cop .
and yet i phoned you to tell you about the stash , didn &apos;t i ?
which i wouldn &apos;t do if i were compromised .
true ?
i guess i could just be confused .
good job , kalinda .
anything you can find to tie it to the task force would help .
are you all right ?
you sound like you &apos;ve been running .
okay .
something special ?
just an $ 8,000 bottle of wine .
a what ?
an $ 8,000 bottle of wine .
so you &apos;re a kept man these days , eh ?
i &apos;m working on it .
you just said the opposite .
no , i did not , ma &apos;am .
then i don &apos;t understand .
well , i can &apos;t help you with that .
look , we found your stash location .
you saw the police investigative report .
you saw the crime scene photos .
so how did mr. arkin &apos;s saliva end up
on the landing two feet away from his body ?
why don &apos;t we take a break .
no , i think we &apos;re fine .
do you have an answer , mr. hunter ?
you say you didn &apos;t touch the body .
so how did he end up on his back ?
i want to confer with counsel .
if that &apos;ll help you get to the truth ,
sure .
okay , no problem .
mr. hunter would like to adjust his testimony .
adjust ?
let &apos;s adjust .
i did move jack arkin &apos;s body .
and why did you do that , sir ?
jack was shot and fell face forward .
i , then , after firing upon and killing mr. gorman ,
proceeded to turn jack over onto his back
because he was wearing a wire , trying to nail us .
where is this wire ?
we gave it to internal affairs .
this wire will be supplied to you
at the end of the business day today .
and guess what , lady ?
that wire that was supposed to catch us--
it shows this thing went down exactly the way we said .
so i &apos;ll be waiting for your apology .
you know what i would do if i were you , alicia ?
i &apos;d prepare for a season of losing .
so they &apos;re saying this supports their version of events .
i hate to say it , but i think it does .
no , doesn &apos;t matter if it supports it .
what do you mean ?
look at the incident report .
gorman was lying in wait , gun in hands .
and within seconds of arkin coming through the door ,
gorman was firing .
so it was a setup ?
well , the task force knew
arkin was the first one through the door .
they didn &apos;t need to kill arkin .
they just needed gorman to do it .
okay , wrongful death is wrongful death .
so let &apos;s look at gorman .
did someone contact him ? check phone records--
any acquaintance in common with hunter .
please forgive the lateness , people .
we &apos;ll get started .
just come right in .
there you go .
and grab a seat , make yourselves at ... at home .
there you go . there you go .
mrs. florrick .
pastor isaiah .
how are you ?
hello .
what can i do for you ?
you can leave my son alone .
won &apos;t you come in ?
you say you &apos;re a man of god ;
then stop making him feel this way .
what way is that , ma &apos;am ?
like he &apos;s a bad man .
he is a bad man .
i &apos;m a bad man . even you , mrs. florrick .
who do you think you are ?
you think you know people ?
you just use the same words with everyone .
y @-@ you just say &quot; god . &quot;
and you think you can make people feel bad about themselves .
mrs. florrick , your son approached me .
he asked advice from me .
i will continue to offer that advice .
and i will do everything in my power to stop you .
you don &apos;t know my son .
this is a phase . you are a phase .
then we &apos;ll see .
no , you &apos;ll see .
he &apos;s running , this year .
he &apos;s my blood , and i don &apos;t know what your god does ,
but it doesn &apos;t match that .
dinner .
we &apos;re never getting out .
let &apos;s do it .
the first time we met ?
it was a pool party , wasn &apos;t it ?
indoctrination-- or what do they call it ?
orientation .
yeah , it was a midnight pool party .
about a hundred law students trying to impress each other .
did you swim ?
no , i was too shy .
you were the one doing cannonballs .
god , that is so embarrassing .
it wasn &apos;t at the time .
so ... what did you think of me ?
ah ... no .
what ?
dangerous conversation .
well , now you have to tell me .
come on , i &apos;ll tell you what i thought of you .
so giada seems sweet .
there &apos;s a segue .
yes , she is sweet .
and third year at depaul .
yeah , she &apos;s just getting her retainer out .
so is it always gonna be this way , between us ?
i want to say yes ,
but i want to know what you mean .
just ... talking .
being casual and ...
blunt ?
i like myself around you , alicia .
i don &apos;t like myself around a lot of people .
you do .
it &apos;s an act .
it &apos;s perfected over a millennium .
don &apos;t answer it .
it &apos;s just life again .
yes , and that &apos;s why i have to .
hello .
kalinda , what &apos;s up ?
no , i &apos;m just with will .
no .
okay , i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll meet you there .
kalinda got the dealer gorman &apos;s phone records .
the night of the shooting ,
he had two calls from a hank lydell .
hank lydell ? who &apos;s hank lydell ?
no idea .
kalinda checked , no priors .
i &apos;m gonna meet her there .
okay .
nice dinner .
it was worth the wait .
we always have options , alicia .
i &apos;m just saying .
we have no idea who hank lydell is ?
or why he was urgently phoning a meth dealer
an hour before he killed a cop .
it doesn &apos;t look like an addict &apos;s house .
i don &apos;t think there is a look to an addict &apos;s house .
what were you doing with will ?
having dinner .
thank you for waiting .
mr. lydell is right this way .
that &apos;s very unlikely .
hank has some good days ,
but his arthritis keeps him from dialing the phone .
and you &apos;ve never heard him talk about a man named gorman ?
no .
who else has access to the phone ?
here ? any of us .
us ?
nursing care .
hank has 24 @-@ hour nursing care .
i have the graveyard shift .
is there anyway to find out who was the nurse on duty
the night of the killing , april 15th ?
that was ... trish .
trish arkin .
did i say something wrong ?
no . it &apos;s just that &apos;s the wife of the deceased .
so our client did it ?
she apparently warned the meth dealer
that her husband was coming to arrest him .
how did she even know him ?
apparently through the husband .
and the rest of the task force ?
innocent .
well , we don &apos;t know that for sure .
but it does look like it was just arkin
who was stashing the weapons and the drugs .
he realized internal affairs was looking into him ,
so he thought he would make a deal and turn on his partners .
and trish ?
she was a battered woman ;
didn &apos;t want to enter witness relocation with her husband .
well , that explains the leak .
when we counted who was in the room , we didn &apos;t count the wife .
yep .
and you want to hear an even greater irony ?
cook county wants to avoid embarrassment .
they just made us an offer to drop the case .
how much ?
a half a million .
so trish gets her husband killed , blames the police
and makes a cool half mill .
are we taking it ?
well , i don &apos;t think we can get them any higher .
no , i mean , are we taking anything ?
she &apos;s guilty , and she &apos;ll get off .
she &apos;s our client .
it &apos;s our job .
and at what point is our job wrong ?
when it fails our client .
so let &apos;s advise our client to ... to accept the offer .
so i seem to be a suspect .
apparently , internal affairs is looking into
my connection with the arkin shooting .
yeah , i heard .
this stuff seems to be coming from your lawsuit .
that &apos;s right .
so why all the questions
about what i do for friends ?
what , you thought i did it ?
yeah .
go to hell .
what ?
what ? !
nothing . i just , um ...
i &apos;m sorry .
what is this ?
who really tipped off gorman .
one , two . mic check , testing ...
so , is this just an exoneration victory lap
or is he going to announce ?
gail , you &apos;ll find out in one hour .
oh , come on .
mrs. florrick going to be on stage with him ?
excuse me .
this is gold .
i don &apos;t know .
they &apos;re not going to leave us alone-- the press .
you &apos;re right .
you know , i was reading about these murals in sienna .
and one of them showed good government .
people happy .
buildings going up .
courts making good decisions .
and on the opposite wall was bad government .
it was the same people , but they were ...
they were unhappy ,
the courts were making bad decisions .
it occurred to me
that it only works if people step up ...
if you make the sacrifice .
look , i was just an okay state &apos;s attorney ,
nothing special .
but i want to be a great one .
and i can &apos;t do it without you .
i don &apos;t want the kids involved .
they won &apos;t be .
and i want to work .
i want you to work .
a little more than a year ago ,
i stood at this podium
and apologized to the public and to my family
about a personal failure .
i made a very bad mistake .
i betrayed my marital vows .
hello . will ?
alicia , hi .
where are you ?
peter &apos;s press conference .
is everything all right ?
yes .
i was just thinking-- i don &apos;t want to go through life
and think something didn &apos;t happen just because i didn &apos;t make myself clear .
i can &apos;t hear you .
i said i want to make something clear .
hold on .
all those charges were dropped .
that puts me back where i belong .
okay , i just need to say it .
we &apos;ve been up and down , back and forth ,
and i look at you , alicia , and i think that ...
will ...
no , i just need to say this .
no .
show me the plan .
the what ?
the plan .
i get the romance .
i need a plan .
not everything needs a plan .
everything that matters does .
i have two kids that mean the world to me .
i have the press .
they &apos;re just waiting for a whiff of a new scandal .
and i have a husband .
justice is what this job should be about .
so if you want to cut through all that noise ,
then show me a plan .
poetry is easy . it &apos;s the parent @-@ teacher conferences that are hard .
alicia , come on .
i have to go now .
come on .
i ... okay .
now i realize that i cannot do this alone .
with your support ,
i hope to become the state &apos;s attorney of cook county once again .
it won &apos;t be easy , but it &apos;s necessary .
you &apos;re going to make my life harder .
change it we can , change it we must ,
because chicago once again needs a change .
because chicago once again needs a new beginning .
i believe i am that change ,
and i believe that i am that new beginning .
thank you for listening .
alicia .
