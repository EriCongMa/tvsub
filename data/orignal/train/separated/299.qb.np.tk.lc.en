max , that car has been parked outside for a week now .
do you think they &apos;re selling drugs ?
let me rephrase that .
are they selling drugs to you ?
no . they &apos;re not buying , either .
hi . we have a new mochaccino cupcake .
oh , no . no , no , no . that car &apos;s not with us .
well , that &apos;s the third customer that didn &apos;t stop
because of that rap car .
to be fair , this place wasn &apos;t walmart on black friday
before the car showed up .
i &apos;m gonna go ask it to move .
cool .
i &apos;ll tell your horse you died brave .
stupid , but brave .
at least take this pan ,
and cover the part you wanna get shot in the least .
hi . can i talk to you for a second ?
i need to see your head at all times .
first of all ,
they &apos;re obsessed with me .
second of all ,
i handled it .
have i been shot ?
well , i did it . i saved the neighborhood .
you had a car towed .
you didn &apos;t burn down the bed bath &amp; beyond .
it wasn &apos;t the blue one with the tinted windows ,
aka , the murder car ?
aka , the murder car ?
tell me that &apos;s the name of the make and model ,
like , &quot; the toyota murder &quot; &quot;
are you sure you &apos;re not thinking of the honda stabbing ?
caroline , some guy stopped by asking for you
with a festive bandana and a teardrop tattoo .
a festive bandana and a teardrop tattoo--
are you sure it wasn &apos;t my mother ?
he said he wanted to talk to you about his car ,
so i gave him your number .
han !
i thought he was your friend .
i don &apos;t have friends with tattoos .
i don &apos;t even have friends with split ends .
you gave a stranger my number .
your number , your e @-@ mail , and your address .
what ? you &apos;re a busy girl .
i didn &apos;t know the best way for him to reach you .
oh , my god . max , am i in trouble ?
pick @-@ up , dead meat .
what does that mean ?
it means it &apos;s never a good idea to have
a car with tinted windows towed .
that &apos;s rule number one .
i thought rule number one was ,
&quot; always wipe front to back . &quot;
max , i &apos;m worried .
me too .
i thought it was back to front .
what &apos;s up , nat king cool ?
and , my brother from a jewish mother .
hey , my daddy that just smoked a fatty .
oh , look , max , it &apos;s your boyfriend .
he &apos;s not my boyfriend . we just made out .
i make out with people all the time .
i made out with a guy in the diner last week .
that wasn &apos;t making out .
he was choking , and you gave him mouth @-@ to @-@ mouth .
yeah , but it led to sex . go away .
hey , max , i came in to ask you something .
they &apos;re natural , and they hurt my back .
i also wanted to know
if you want to hang tomorrow night .
we could watch tv with our shirts off .
maybe .
and i &apos;ll buy you some dinner if you put out .
ooh , so like a date .
i &apos;m willing to throw $ 10 , $ 15 at this thing .
you want to throw $ 15 at my thing ?
great .
i usually charge $ 5 .
you came all the way here to ask me out ?
i &apos;m old @-@ fashioned .
plus , i dropped my phone in the toilet .
see ya tomorrow .
okay .
now go . i have a job to not do .
okay .
go , idiot .
okay , dummy .
okay , han , i can &apos;t hold you up anymore .
max , i think i just saw the murder car go by ,
out the bathroom window .
what exactly did you see ?
a car .
no , seriously , i think it followed me home .
well , three years ago , you followed me home ,
so we &apos;re even .
there you go , nancy .
okay , i &apos;m off on my date .
you can &apos;t leave me here alone .
there &apos;s a murder car out there .
relax . no one is after you .
oh , really ?
what about the person who yelled ,
&quot; watch yo back , bitch &quot; when we were walking home ?
that was me , to that girl scout .
if you tell someone you &apos;re carrying thin mints ,
you best be carrying thin mints .
max , you &apos;re coming back tonight , right ?
i &apos;m kind of afraid .
i &apos;ve never been here alone at night .
if you don &apos;t want to be alone , why don &apos;t you call han ?
very funny .
i did . han &apos;s busy .
he &apos;s going to a country square dance on second life .
it &apos;s an online game ,
but he says it &apos;s more of a lifestyle .
don &apos;t you have to have a first life
to have a second life ?
max , please stay .
call deke and cancel ,
or else you might come home to find me in a pool of blood .
oh , i always wanted a pool .
oh , no , it &apos;s them , here to kill me .
it couldn &apos;t be .
i haven &apos;t paid them all the money yet .
oh , hi , girls .
you know , i just came from the dentist &apos;s office .
did you know that michael jackson died ?
oh , and farrah fawcett too ?
oh , no , i &apos;ve got to sit down .
well , since you &apos;re here ,
do you want to stay and have a girls &apos; night ?
oh , that &apos;s sounds like fun .
it &apos;s just me and you . max has a date .
and caroline &apos;s afraid to be alone .
well , if you don &apos;t want to be alone ,
then why do you act the way you do ?
i got to go meet deke .
we are going out to get wasted ,
hopefully to the point of blowing chunks on each other &apos;s shoes .
but imagine it a little less romantic than it sounds .
well , caroline , it &apos;s just me and you .
i know . i thought it &apos;d be fun if--
well , we tried .
good night .
don &apos;t go .
dangerous people are after me .
you know , in poland , when the cossacks came ,
we would boil water
and then throw it in their faces
and then make soup .
anyway , have a good one . wait .
hello ?
rula ? yes .
no , i have absolutely nothing to do tonight .
well , nancy , looks like it &apos;s just you and me .
yep , you and me and this magazine from 2009 .
ah , 2009--
the last year i had anything .
let &apos;s see , nancy .
what are we gonna read here ?
&quot; new york city more dangerous than ever . &quot;
okay , that &apos;s it . we &apos;re done .
that &apos;s just a horn , right ?
or is it a signal ?
no offense , nancy ,
but we really need a dog in this situation .
oh , guess what .
we happen to be in my neighborhood .
oh , you are smooth .
also , you aggressively steered me here
and stopped at a bodega to buy me condoms .
so you want to come back to my place , and ...
brown chicken brown cow ?
brown chicken what ?
后来常被用来表示发情淫荡
you know , &quot; bowm chica wowm wowm , &quot; but i made it ...
brown chicken , brown cow .
so you thought of that in your head ,
and your brain was like , &quot; that &apos;s okay to say &quot; ?
no , my brain was like , &quot; don &apos;t say it ,
don &apos;t say it , don &apos;t say it , don &apos;t say it &quot;
and then it was ...
brown chicken , brown cow .
well , this is me .
what do you want me to say--
&quot; congratulations . you live in a building &quot; ?
no , that would be lame . i don &apos;t live in a building .
i live here .
where ? all i see is a dumpster .
yeah , it &apos;s my apartment .
i converted it , and i live inside .
it &apos;s totally green .
i mean , it &apos;s horrible for the environment ,
but it &apos;s the color green .
oh , you &apos;re not kidding .
you live in a dumpster ?
this is usually the part where the girl says
she has to be up early tomorrow
or call the police .
so do you have to go ?
yeah .
i have to go inside the freakin &apos; cool dumpster .
and if you think it &apos;s cool now , watch this .
my dumpster &apos;s a grower , not a shower .
holy crap . this is amazing .
you have a sink in here and a stove .
is it heated in here , or did you teach the rats
to shovel coal into the engine ?
yes , but there &apos;s also solar panels on the roof .
and a microwave
and a bathroom right here .
you have a microwave next to your toilet ?
you &apos;re a genius !
that &apos;s the smartest way to eat a burrito .
i think of everything .
and if you don &apos;t like your neighbors ,
you push your house to a new street .
or you could just kill them
and throw their bodies in here .
added bonus--no rent .
and the chinese restaurant next door
always tosses their garbage on my roof .
free delivery , yo .
you don &apos;t have to tell me .
i read all about this place in &quot; dumpster living . &quot;
i &apos;ll take it .
all right , but it comes with a very handsome
stuffed animal of a man with hair that gets him
followed by security at macy &apos;s .
i &apos;m not just saying this &apos; cause you live in a dumpster ,
but i &apos;ll take some ...
brown chicken , brown cow right now .
so what was your first time having sex in a dumpster like ?
a lot like the other times i &apos;ve had sex in a dumpster .
next time i &apos;m gonna be naked .
next time i won &apos;t be wearing this hat .
i hope you don &apos;t mind .
i sleep like this .
aah ! get off me .
oh , so nice to have a live body under me for a change .
stop ! you &apos;re crushing me !
this is really nice .
yeah , it is .
i got to go .
you got to go ?
yeah , i live , uh , all the way over by the diner .
plus , i got to pull these boots on .
and i got a horse and a cat ,
possibly a dead roommate , so ...
right . you got to be up early .
yeah , but not like that .
it &apos;s just , like--
where &apos;s the door handle ?
is it the coffee pot ?
i can &apos;t get out .
i &apos;m used to climbing out of these things .
ah , it &apos;s right here .
oh . sure you don &apos;t want to stay ?
chinese restaurant just delivered .
there &apos;s that horn again .
there is no way this is not about us .
max , it &apos;s me again .
why do you even have a phone
if you &apos;re not gonna pick it up ?
and also , you are a grown lady .
why is your outgoing message a fart ?
and i am sure you &apos;re in the middle of
having very silly sex ,
but it is a nightmare around here .
chestnut , nancy , and i are all convinced
that the murder car is still circling
and about to take us all out .
so self @-@ involved .
this water is taking forever to boil .
the best i could do now is offer the killers
warm tea before they dismember me .
that &apos;d be funny if you got jokes .
okay , guys , here &apos;s the plan .
if they come in that door , we go out this door .
if they come in that door , chestnut , you block them ,
and , nancy , you go for their eyes .
you know what ? let &apos;s just say our good @-@ byes now .
boil , boil , boil .
no time !
whoever you are , i have a pot of pretty hot water !
what is all this junk ?
my legs ! my beautiful legs !
i burned my toe cleavage .
and it &apos;s the only cleavage i have .
if it helps , your toes do look bigger .
thank god i have these flip @-@ flops
i used to wear in your shower before i gave up .
yes , hi , i have a complete emergency .
my legs are burned .
okay , i hear you .
i &apos;ll put you right behind the guy whose legs just came off .
thank you . i appreciate that .
see , i just got burned with pretty hot water ,
and i wear a lot of peep @-@ toe shoes .
insurance provider ?
i &apos;d like to use my obamacare .
oh , obamacare ? why didn &apos;t you say so ?
come right in .
what is the problem ?
we &apos;re all entitled to obamacare .
that &apos;s what that rachel maddow guy said .
而其网站注册的技术问题至今未能完全解决 所以未能全民推行
i &apos;ll need more information than that .
password , malia ?
you clowns need to figure out your insurance information
and come back to me in about two hours
when i &apos;m on my sofa ,
drinking whiskey out of a coffee mug .
max , let &apos;s just sit .
they have to take us , by law .
i know because i used to complain about that .
max , can you take that flu season pamphlet
and fan my feet ?
no .
i &apos;m not touching anything in here ,
&apos;cause i was never vaccinated ...
or loved .
who is it ?
it &apos;s deke .
you &apos;re not gonna answer it ?
no , right now , i am very concerned about your legs .
aw . you &apos;re lying .
what happened between you and deke ?
why did you even come home tonight ?
was the sex bad ?
did you hit him ?
no , the sex was fine .
actually , it was better than fine .
it was great and i wanted to stay .
so ... ?
so i left immediately .
max , don &apos;t take this the wrong way ,
but it sounds like you found someone
who finally makes you happy
and you &apos;re trying to ruin it .
oh , that &apos;s what this feeling is .
well , i got to get rid of it .
why ?
i wasn &apos;t raised to be happy .
i was raised to believe canned meat is as good as it gets .
earl , i spilled hot water on my feet .
you can &apos;t imagine how much pain i &apos;m in .
well , i kicked heroin in a 7 / 11 bathroom
for three days .
but sorry about your burnt tootsies though .
caroline , sorry i didn &apos;t text you back .
i would &apos;ve come over last night ,
but my second life wife had a baby .
i just can &apos;t believe you had
fake sex nine months ago and didn &apos;t tell anyone .
excuse me .
i &apos;m looking for a skinny blonde that works here .
uh ... she died .
she right over there .
ooh , she came back to life !
hallelujah !
hey , i got something for you .
no !
it &apos;s a mix tape .
no !
i made it for you .
i &apos;m sorry my brother threw that cupcake at you .
he &apos;s gluten @-@ free and upset about it .
so can i take you out sometime ?
uh ... uh , very sweet , and you seem great ,
but i &apos;m already in a relationship
with a guy in a red bandana .
no worries . just thought i &apos;d ask .
what did you just do ?
you never say no to a guy with tinted windows .
that &apos;s rule number two .
well , his number &apos;s on here . i can always call him back .
then we can both be in relationships
we don &apos;t want to be in .
relationship ?
deke .
you &apos;re gonna see him at pastry school tomorrow .
he &apos;s gonna wanna know .
guys never wanna know .
in fact , they are dying not to know .
max , why &apos;d you leave last night ?
i wanna know .
i mean , you were all like , &quot; wham @-@ bam , thank you , man . &quot;
and yeah , my brain was like , &quot; don &apos;t say it ,
don &apos;t say it , don &apos;t say it , don &apos;t say it , &quot;
but i said it .
what &apos;s going on ?
uh ... the sex was bad .
what about the scratches on my back ?
i was trying to get away .
i &apos;ll just leave you two alone .
i &apos;ll just be over here , looking at my mix tape .
oh , track one , &quot; make it nasty . &quot;
you &apos;re right , max .
the sex was bad , really bad .
and it was worse when we did it the second time .
and that third time was a disaster .
i mean , i only lasted 47 minutes , and you screamed .
okay , walking away has to be
less painful than hearing this .
no , stay , caroline . we &apos;ll go outside .
max , come with me for a second .
i wanna show you something .
just whip it out here .
you wouldn &apos;t be the first guy to do that tonight .
nor will he be the last .
okay , what do you wanna show me ?
is that your dumpster ?
look , you said you couldn &apos;t stay over
because you lived all the way over by the diner ,
so i moved it here to figure out
what your next excuse would be .
um , i &apos;m racist .
yeah , me too . white girls are a hassle .
what else ?
you have a bird on your shirt .
you love it .
i do .
what else ?
i got nothin &apos; .
good .
so what do you say
you stop being such a stupid face ,
and get your sweet dumper
into my dumpster right now ,
where a brown chicken and a brown cow
are waiting patiently for you .
look .
if you want me in that dumpster ,
you &apos;ll have to get me there the traditional way .
duct tape my wrists ,
throw a bag over my head , and toss me in .
awful , huh ?
so bad .
want to do it again later ,
and then sleep over tonight , and then do it again ?
sure .
are we ever gonna do it naked ?
yeah , when you move into a place
big enough for me to take my pants off .
look , i got to warn you .
i don &apos;t know how to be happy .
then why do you have that big smile on your face ?
i &apos;m faking it .
why is it shaking ? are we still having sex ?
thank you , sir . enjoy your cupcake .
max ?
don &apos;t tow us . this is deke &apos;s house .
he lives in a dumpster ?
yeah , but on purpose .
but you &apos;re coming home tonight , right ?
max , max !
han ?
han , what are you doing tonight ?
