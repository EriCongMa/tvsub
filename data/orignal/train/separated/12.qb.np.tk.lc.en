第五季 第二十一集
paisley group already leads the other fortune 500 companies
in the global and industry trend toward consumer use of green products ,
while providing competitive advantages
in efficacy and safety .
now , this doesn &apos;t mean ...
not now . not ever .
ah ... sounds like our protestor friends agree with us .
now is not the time for brunch .
all right . in short ,
the merger of our two great companies
will ensure our competitive edge .
but more important ,
for the pension funds you manage ;
it &apos;ll mean a greater return on your investments .
now ... are there any questions ?
yeah . mr. paisley .
how much domestic workforce
would you anticipate shedding as a result of this merger ?
you sound like one of the protestors out there .
regrettably , it could be as much as 20 percent stateside .
we &apos;re gonna hope to hold to that line .
what about the wrongful termination suit
by your former cfo ?
well , i &apos;m not stupid .
i &apos;ll leave that to my lawyer .
yes . we &apos;re confident that this suit has no merit ...
he &apos;s claiming he was fired because he was gay .
yes . he &apos;s claiming that .
kyle musset was fired for cause .
he was attempting to sell trade secrets to a competitor ...
if the suit drags on ...
it could hang over the stock price .
well , we &apos;re in negotiations now and we &apos;re confident
that this suit will set ...
down with corporate imperialism !
didn &apos;t i tell you this was gonna be fun ?
mr. canning , hello .
alicia &apos;s just a few minutes behind you .
so , this is what a start @-@ up looks like .
yep . 35 employees . seven partners .
$ 21 million in yearly billing .
another $ 5 million and you &apos;ll be able to
afford doors for your conference room .
it &apos;s a design choice .
yeah , the design choice
that lets other people listen in on your meetings .
lindsay , can you get my sweater from m ... ?
oh . mr. canning .
we ready to put this to bed ?
yeah . i &apos;m ready for court , uh ...
i think we just honor our trial date tomorrow .
my goodness , what happened to you ?
or is that , uh , another design choice ?
excuse me .
it was a mishap .
we , uh , considered your client &apos;s latest demands ...
and , um , our top offering is $ 150,000 .
we &apos;ll take our chances in court .
good . that was quick .
good to see you .
he was fired because he was gay .
how &apos;s that gonna go over with your fund managers ?
like extortion . you &apos;re lucky to get $ 150,000 .
$ 200,000 .
no . $ 140,000 .
you have changed .
yes . i have .
i liked the old alicia better .
the $ 200,000 alicia ?
all right , fine . i &apos;ll talk to my client ,
you talk to your ... corporate overlord and then , uh ...
in the meantime , get that cleaned up ,
cause , it &apos;s gonna leave a stain .
yeah . thanks .
finn . what &apos;s up ?
hey . alicia , i &apos;m sorry , am i early ?
for ?
eli .
we have a meeting about the governor &apos;s announcement .
oh , my god . i &apos;m so sorry . i completely forgot .
you okay ?
oh , yeah . someone hit me with a pie .
it &apos;s a long story .
good news . great news .
where can we talk ? how about your desk ?
i got an early copy .
comes out tonight and it couldn &apos;t be more perfect .
eli , what is it ?
oh , alicia , maybe you shouldn &apos;t look .
it &apos;s the report on the jeffrey grant shooting .
no , i &apos;m fine , eli . what &apos;s it say ?
well , it clears finn of any wrongdoing ...
what happened to your ...
pie . what &apos;s it say , eli ?
it clears finn of any responsibility
for the shooting and lays the blame firmly
at the feet of the state &apos;s attorney .
that &apos;s good .
it &apos;s great . how &apos;d you get pie on you ?
so , peter will reference it in his public endorsement ?
yes . now here &apos;s the thing--
this is the most dangerous time for you .
because castro will try to strike back .
he &apos;ll try and undercut this report by exposing something on you .
well , that &apos;s good , there is nothing on me .
your sister &apos;s overdose ,
your wife &apos;s miscarriage .
what &apos;s wrong with my wife &apos;s miscarriage ?
you divorced her after the miscarriage ...
eli .
why don &apos;t we do this another time ?
i didn &apos;t divorce her .
oh , come on , you don &apos;t understand .
this is not about the facts .
it &apos;s what the facts can be made to look like .
what do you need , eli ?
castro is gonna try and get in touch with you
with whatever he has-- a photo , a xerox ,
something from your past . bring it to me .
whatever it is , it &apos;ll make you angry ,
but bring it to me . okay ?
okay .
good .
i &apos;m gonna go .
i still can &apos;t get used to this place .
you need more walls .
well , he &apos;s a barrel of laughs .
yes , he takes his job very seriously .
and there &apos;s no one better at it .
look , i @-@ i &apos;d advise against court .
i just ... - ... has happened 14 separate times .
and that should prove causation .
who &apos;s that in with diane ?
some lady .
she doesn &apos;t like men .
no , i mean who are the people ?
the people . in there ?
yes .
i don &apos;t know .
what do i call you ? is it , uh ,
crippled or handicapped or ... what &apos;s that other word ?
what do you call me ?
yeah .
uh , how about louis ?
no , when i &apos;m talking to other people ,
what do i call you ?
challenged .
hmm ? isn &apos;t that the word-- challenged ?
do you like that ?
yes .
... we &apos;ll serve kael pepper ... - diane .
do you ... do you need me ?
no .
mr. canning .
hello , i &apos;m rayna hecht .
well , ms. hecht , from hecht &amp; tascioni ?
you run a tight little shop over there .
thank you , we try .
so , what do we got going ?
class action . kael pepper .
oh , that was ... that was terrible .
uh , i didn &apos;t know we signed it .
uh , rayna asked us to be co @-@ counsel .
my goodness . good luck .
terrible thing .
all those children .
is there something wrong ?
office politics .
oh , i know that tune .
so , i know it will be difficult talking about the illnesses ,
but the stories that you &apos;ve told us ,
you &apos;ll have to repeat .
kalinda .
something is going on in that little head of his .
could you find out ?
canning ?
yes . he came in here ,
heard about the kael pepper class action ,
and then rushed off .
i &apos;ll find out .
good things come to those who wait ? well , i guess ...
$ 140,000 .
i don &apos;t know why we have to pay him a cent-- he &apos;s a thief .
because we have a court date set for tomorrow
if we don &apos;t settle this . mr. paisley ,
the merger &apos;s worth $ 3.7 billion .
$ 140,000 is nothing .
it &apos;s a lot of money .
to me , yeah .
to you , it &apos;s what you made while you were sitting here .
i like that sweater .
thanks .
send me your cleaning bill .
agree to pay $ 140,000 and i &apos;ll pay the cleaning bill .
mr. paisley , we &apos;re ready for you .
you know what i like about you , alicia ?
i have no idea .
you don &apos;t take this stuff too seriously .
you and me together on the barricades , huh ?
hold off the hordes .
$ 140,000 ?
pay &apos; em off .
don &apos;t even want to think about it again .
it &apos;s called &quot; merger insanity . &quot;
the new wave of big ticket deals sweeping the biotech industry .
and the newest merger has an old , respected name at the helm .
james paisley .
hi there .
we &apos;ll be joined by mr. paisley shortly ...
geez , kalinda , don &apos;t startle me like that .
do you have a minute ?
for you , all the time in the world .
what &apos;s wrong with the kael pepper class action ?
i don &apos;t know . is there something wrong
with the kael pepper class action ?
louis .
now , this relationship here--the one between us--
is only gonna work if we &apos;re gonna be up front with each other .
diane has asked me to find out
why you have a problem with her class action .
now , i could investigate ...
as you did with my health issues .
or ...
we could be adults .
just ask questions and talk .
i &apos;m in the process of signing kael pepper labs .
now , we can &apos;t represent both the company
and the people who are suing the company .
true .
so i have to figure out a way to ...
just ... wait . just a sec . ... mr. james paisley .
i understand there was a bit of drama
at your presentation to the top pension fund managers .
oh , you mean the pie incident .
wait , turn it up .
someone from the protest infiltrated your meeting
and hit you with a pie .
not even a very tasty pie , i might add .
and was this to protest the fact that this merger
would be sending jobs overseas .
honestly , steven , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s about .
i don &apos;t know what these people want .
i &apos;m standing in my board room ,
people downstairs handcuffing themselves to the receptionist &apos;s desk ,
honking horns , not letting us out of the building .
i felt like , uh ...
anne frank , hiding from the nazis .
no , no .
well , that &apos;s a bit extreme , isn &apos;t it ?
not really . i feel this country &apos;s turned on its head .
曾就 「 世界新闻报 」 电话窃听事件发表大胆言论
tom perkins may have put it inelegantly ,
but he wasn &apos;t that far wrong .
don &apos;t say it . don &apos;t say it .
go for it , go for it , say it .
the one percent is the new hunted minority in this country .
not unlike the jews in nazi germany .
goal !
don &apos;t call him now , he &apos;ll just know you &apos;re on the run
and he &apos;ll up the price .
we have to risk it .
as soon as he sees this , he &apos;s gonna want to go to court .
it doesn &apos;t change the facts .
it taints the jury pool .
i wonder how long i should make her wait .
hi . he saw the interview .
kalinda ?
yeah , he watched the whole interview . hang on .
that was really crappy .
i know .
hey , alicia ,
uh , we &apos;re gonna take our chances in court .
your case is weak .
yeah , we both know it &apos;s not about the case anymore .
it &apos;s about jury selection and ,
uh , it &apos;s gonna be over before you can say , &quot; ladies and gentlemen of the jury . &quot;
we &apos;ll go up to $ 200,000 .
nope , it &apos;s now $ 3 million .
then we &apos;ll see you in court .
that &apos;s my line .
thanks for seeing me on such short notice , peter .
jim .
so .
what can i do for you ?
it &apos;s about the state &apos;s attorney race and finn polmar .
well , i figured as much .
are you referring to the attorney general &apos;s report ?
apparently the worst @-@ kept secret in illinois .
i did approve the charges .
i thought they were justified .
but i certainly never put a gun in jeffrey grant &apos;s hand .
i think the voters will see that .
well , great . great .
okay , so , it was good talking to you .
it &apos;s finn polmar
coming out of your wife &apos;s apartment building .
that &apos;s really pathetic , jim .
i didn &apos;t take the picture , peter .
it &apos;s from a surveillance camera .
yeah , well , i think you &apos;ll see that i was there , also .
two months ago .
my wife was representing finn ...
against you , i believe .
this is from two weeks ago .
i &apos;m not gonna use it , peter ,
but it will come out .
finn will be asked about it .
your wife will be asked about it .
you &apos;ll be asked about it .
how do you think it will look
that you endorsed your wife &apos;s lover ?
i know it &apos;s hard ...
seriously ?
that &apos;s your ... ?
well , it was good talking to you .
have a good day , jim .
so , how are we with the endorsement ?
want me to polish it ?
no .
but you &apos;re fine with it ?
who told us about him ?
who told us about finn ?
yes .
i did .
so you convinced finn to run ?
no . i think alicia did .
why ?
let &apos;s wait on the endorsement .
w @-@ why ?
i just don &apos;t want to make a big thing of it .
uh , peter , just so you know ,
you have already endorsed him .
you just haven &apos;t appeared with him .
yeah , i know . but let &apos;s hold off on it , okay ?
we got a problem .
i know .
kael pepper and my class action .
we can only represent one of &apos; em .
yes . the one that was signed first . kalinda .
the class action ...
geez , you @-@ you pop out of nowhere .
the class action was signed yesterday at 3 : 00 .
you signed kael pepper at 5 : 00 .
no , i signed him at 2 : 00 . i submitted it at 5 : 00 .
kael pepper only approached you because of our suit .
they want this to be a conflict of interest .
no , they approached us because we &apos;re good lawyers ,
and they bring $ 8 million in yearly business .
their facility polluted the ground water .
they poisoned those kids .
that &apos;s debatable .
no , it isn &apos;t .
diane , if you represent only the innocent ,
you &apos;ll go quickly out of business .
i got to get to court .
tell kael pepper thank you ,
but no thank you .
you know , let &apos;s bring it
to the executive committee .
you pitch , i &apos;ll pitch , and we &apos;ll let the firm decide .
i got to go . boo .
are you jewish ?
am i jewish ? yeah . why ?
i need you to sit second chair .
on what ?
do you care ?
the voir dire process is a very important one ,
because it enables the court
and the lawyers to determine whether or not
each of you would be appropriate jurors
for this particular case .
canning &apos;s right .
this trial is over in voir dire .
you had in your employment contract
that we only need a majority to prevail ,
so , we just need seven .
whoever gets the first seven jurors
has the upper hand in negotiations .
this isn &apos;t about going to trial .
this is about getting seven jurors .
it could be the difference between
a $ 200,000 settlement and $ 8.5 million .
what do i do ?
look wise , and ...
every time i touch my nose , you whisper in my ear .
very well , then . let &apos;s begin .
ms. economus , in your capacity as a human resources manager ,
do you have access to what other people make ?
i mean , salary ?
yes , i do .
and does it rankle you sometimes
how much more executives get paid than other employees ?
the ceo of your company , for example .
how much more does that person make
than the average , say , claims adjuster ?
i mean , 500 times ?
your honor , objection .
your honor , i believe mr. canning is trying
to prejudice our jury against our client
by using out @-@ of @-@ court statements .
yes , mr. canning , i saw the news coverage
of mr. paisley &apos;s comments , and i am inclined to agree .
your honor , i &apos;m merely trying to determine
whether this juror can fairly judge a man
who makes thousands of times what she ...
oh , so you &apos;re worried about jurors being fair to our client ?
okay . i &apos;m ruling
that any out @-@ of @-@ court statements having to do with class
or economic differences are irrelevant .
now step back .
ms. economus , how much of a reader are you ?
much of a reader ?
well , i guess as much as anybody else .
though i read a lot in college .
have you ever read diary of anne frank ?
your honor ! objection !
mr. canning , i warned you
not to continue with the irrelevant questions .
with irrelevant economic questions , your honor .
this was not ...
you sure ?
yes , uh , your honor , we &apos;d like to amend our suit
to include claim of religious discrimination .
on what grounds ?
mrs. florrick , that &apos;s my job .
my client , mr. musset ,
has jewish ancestry on his father &apos;s side .
and mr. paisley &apos;s insensitive remarks last night
about anne frank and her
tragic ordeal serves to illustrate the anti @-@ semitism .
no , i don &apos;t believe this . your honor ?
no , no .
religious discrimination is a recognized cause of action .
you may think it &apos;s a facade ,
and i may agree with you ,
but that &apos;s what a trial is for .
very well , mr. canning .
you can ask your questions after lunch .
nice work , howard .
you need to talk to paisley .
i &apos;m not going to apologize .
they &apos;re using it to get the jury they want .
yes , but i told the truth .
that being surrounded by protestors was like anne frank ?
i was being hyperbolic .
then apologize for that .
no . alicia , you &apos;re trying
to get me to apologize for the nazi reference
so people will think i &apos;m apologizing for the whole thing .
mr. paisley , you said that
the one percent were like jews in germany .
no . i said tom perkins made a good point .
you know who called me this morning ?
neil gross from chumhum .
said , &quot; thank you .
&quot; it &apos;s about time somebody told the truth . &quot;
mr. paisley , can i have you meet someone ?
it &apos;ll only take a minute .
i &apos;m not gonna change my mind .
mr. fishbein , you can come on in .
where is this putz ?
mr. paisley , i would like you to meet mr. fishbein .
so , you think you have it the same
as the jews of nazi germany ?
i &apos;m gonna let you two talk for a minute .
hey , finn . what &apos;s up ?
hey . i was , uh , just wondering if you knew
why they were delaying the announcement .
no . are we delaying the announcement ?
my office just got a call from eli .
did something change ?
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t know .
did you call eli ?
yes . he &apos;s not returning my calls .
okay , let me see what i can find out .
no , i think it &apos;s just a temporary delay .
you think ?
yes . we &apos;re trying to schedule it for another day .
what &apos;s going on , eli ?
peter won &apos;t sign off on the speech .
he asked me who brought finn to his attention-- you or me .
i did .
i know . look , let me call you back if i find out more , okay ?
peter ?
oh . sorry .
no , no , no , no , no , it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s fine . come on in .
eli , do you know lauren ?
she &apos;s one of our interns .
i haven &apos;t had the pleasure .
i get your coffee every morning , mr. gold .
lauren has started a blog . &quot; ex ...
journalism major &quot; ?
&quot; journalism major in exile . &quot;
ah . anyway , she was hoping
to get an interview with me .
just a human interest piece . you know ,
like , what makes you tick , all that .
yeah . i like it .
so , let &apos;s put it on the schedule .
mm . thank you , mr. florrick .
governor florrick .
governor florrick .
thank you .
oh , by the way ,
don &apos;t worry .
it &apos;s not too red .
what &apos;s not too red ?
her lipstick .
you can go , you stay .
what &apos;s your name ?
lauren .
take a step back .
what ?
take one step back .
you are now 50 feet from the governor &apos;s office .
don &apos;t ever cross this line again .
you are not to talk to the governor .
you &apos;re not to look at the governor .
if the governor talks to you ,
you will smile , nod , and say you &apos;re needed in polling
on the third floor .
i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
you asked him if your lipstick was red enough .
just for future reference , that &apos;s wrong .
he complimented me on it .
lauren ,
do you want your job ?
50 feet .
this line . get it ?
yes .
good .
i just want to express my sincere regret
for my unfortunate choice of words yesterday .
good job . how &apos;d you do it ?
mr. fishbein , the holocaust survivor .
... obviously comparing myself ,
or anyone to anne frank was extreme and ill @-@ considered ,
and i want to apologize to anyone
who may have been offended by my insensitivity ...
yup , alicia got to him .
what ?
i understand you &apos;ve come on tonight
after meeting with a holocaust survivor .
yes , and i will say that it was an enlightening experience .
but he understood that these were the words
of a self @-@ educated man who was struggling for a metaphor .
that &apos;s all .
good , good .
he also understood my frustration with the protestors .
no .
you mean , the backlash against the one percent .
is that what i am ?
i always thought i was a guy just trying to make a living .
stop talking !
and your &quot; frustration , &quot; as you put it , is with those who don &apos;t ?
look , a man has to pull his weight .
this is america ,
and there &apos;s a reason for this being the greatest country in the world .
we reward winners .
this is not italy or greece .
we do not reward the lazy .
oh , dear god . someone just throw a blanket over him .
do we have any greeks or italians on the jury ?
so , what do you think of tom perkins&apos;
suggestion that voting rights should be tied to tax brackets ?
well , i probably shouldn &apos;t say this ...
oh , say it , say it .
... but i think there &apos;s some merit to it .
well , we just lost juror number four ...
and juror number two ...
and possibly two others . want me to talk to paisley this time ?
no , i will .
don &apos;t babysit me , eli .
don &apos;t ... - i am an adult .
if i want lauren to avoid my office ,
i will tell her myself .
are we talking about that intern ?
yes , we &apos;re talking about that intern .
i will handle my own life .
i don &apos;t need you to be making decisions for me .
peter ,
you are a politician with a reputation .
you can either put that
behind you or ... - i will not be ...
i will not be contained in a bubble .
i have to be with people ; that &apos;s who i am .
okay , if this were a normal conversation ,
i would now make fun of you for saying that
&quot; lauren the intern &quot; is people .
&apos;cause i can find you
people in the supermarket or the shop &apos; n save .
but this doesn &apos;t seem to be a normal conversation ,
so what the hell &apos;s going on ?
nothing &apos;s going on .
i &apos;m just tired of being cooped up .
so plan your vacation with alicia .
no .
oh , come on , peter , you deserve it .
let me call her .
no . no .
please .
why not ?
well , alicia and i ...
peter ... peter ...
it &apos;s okay .
alicia .
do you have time to talk for a minute ?
no , i @-@ i &apos;m coming over .
mom , do we really have to do this right now ?
come on , it &apos;ll only take five minutes .
come on , your grandma wants a picture of you .
i &apos;ll get it .
oh , it &apos;s probably eli .
great . more people to come make fun of me .
hey . mom &apos;s in here .
you look great .
all right , that &apos;s enough .
no , no , no . i need a picture . over here .
come over here .
what &apos;s up , eli ?
nothing much .
just need a few minutes .
zach . grace .
hi .
you sound so formal .
no . i &apos;m just ... - be happy .
be happy .
watching a family ...
... be a family .
okay , okay .
wait up , wait up .
want some ?
uh , n @-@ no .
so , what do we need to discuss away from the kids ?
peter and you .
okay .
shoot .
what &apos;s going on with peter and you ?
why ?
because i get the sense that there &apos;s something going on .
did peter say something ?
no . peter specifically did not say something .
then why are you asking ?
because i care .
what ? i do care .
even if only on the most cynical level ,
but i want peter to stay in office .
then ask peter .
is this about will dying ?
this is about everything .
i &apos;m just tired , eli .
i &apos;m just done .
you &apos;re getting a divorce ?
no .
then what ?
we &apos;re staying together , but that &apos;s it .
whatever peter does ...
i don &apos;t want the kids to find out .
oh , my ... god .
i can &apos;t believe ... this is crazy .
i have to go hem a robe .
it was good seeing you , eli .
alicia , you &apos;re hurting-- that &apos;s all .
i &apos;ve been watching you over the last year with peter .
you love him .
and if you don &apos;t , he loves you .
not buying what you &apos;re selling , nate .
well , fine . just make it fast .
you need me ?
what &apos;s he offering you ?
who ?
canning . to vote his way against my class action .
nothing . we share a philosophy , that &apos;s all .
money trumps everything ?
well , it is why we &apos;re in business , isn &apos;t it ?
fine . two words : rayna hecht .
the rainmaker ?
she brought me this class action .
it &apos;s important to her .
important enough to bring her here ?
she told me she &apos;s finding life with tascioni a bit , uh ...
too constricting .
and you can deliver ?
i &apos;m giving my final presentation
to the executive committee in two days .
rayna will present as well .
well , if it &apos;s true , i &apos;m all yours .
your honor ,
we have no objections to seating mr. rizzardi--
he seems like he &apos;d make a great juror .
your honor , we &apos;d like to exercise
one of our peremptory challenges .
for what ? why ? what &apos;s wrong with him ?
nothing &apos;s wrong with him .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re exercising our peremptory challenge .
it &apos;s because he &apos;s italian , isn &apos;t it ?
it is our right ...
that &apos;s enough !
mr. rizzardi , you &apos;re excused .
he &apos;s still up by two jurors .
unless we can disqualify one .
your honor ,
may we approach again ?
faster the better . come on .
your honor , my apologies , but i believe that
one of mr. canning &apos;s ... i mean ,
one of the jurors that &apos;s already been seated may have been biased
by my client &apos;s most recent comments .
your honor , this is outrageous .
we &apos;ve already agreed on each one of these jurors .
outrageous , we say .
yes , your honor ,
but if a statement has been made
in the press that would render
one of them incapable of being fair and unbiased ,
well , it &apos;s like mr. canning said :
we all want a fair jury .
so , ms. economus , you heard my client
mr. paisley &apos;s latest comments ?
no .
i mean , i didn &apos;t hear them directly--
a girlfriend of mine
mentioned something about it .
i see . so ,
as a greek person , how did you feel
about his comments about greece as a country ?
this is ridiculous .
i &apos;m from skokie .
yes , but your heritage is greek , isn &apos;t it ?
well , sure . both sides .
so , uh , you must have been offended
when mr. paisley said that if america starts rewarding losers
instead of winners ,
we &apos;ll end up like greece .
uh , y @-@ you know , now that you mention it , yeah ,
it was very offensive .
you have an agreement ?
you and alicia ?
you talked with my wife ?
i did . that &apos;s why the intern ?
eli , i don &apos;t pry into your life .
i don &apos;t have a life ; your life is my life .
then let me live .
so no divorce ?
and you and alicia can do whatever you want
as long as no one knows ?
is that what she told you ?
just so you know , peter , i have worked before
with politicians who have made arrangements
to keep their extramarital activities from becoming public .
it doesn &apos;t work ; it will always come out .
doesn &apos;t matter who-- an intern ,
a donor , your biggest fan ...
they all want to talk .
they &apos;ll promise not to ,
but they will ... talk .
yeah .
and sometimes things come out when they don &apos;t talk .
where &apos;d this come from ?
what was that , peter ?
let &apos;s not discuss it .
we &apos;ve got work to do .
ah , alicia .
do you have some greeks and italians for me to meet ?
you &apos;re going to issue a statement
saying that you &apos;re giving a million dollars to charity ,
and that you do not believe voting should be
tied with a person &apos;s tax bracket .
what if i don &apos;t believe that ?
you think i should have less of a vote than you ?
well , i don &apos;t know ; how much do you make ?
mr. paisley , i know you .
i know you like to think of yourself as blunt and direct .
but this isn &apos;t just blunt .
no , you don &apos;t know me .
you think this is hubris .
i built a business from nothing .
in &apos; 99 , i lost it in the tech bust .
and i built it up again .
from nothing .
you &apos;re not poor now , mr. paisley .
neither are you .
i &apos;ve seen your bills .
you may choose to disguise it
in all these earthy surroundings , but ...
you are the one percent .
did you know my company is developing
a gene that will prolong a person &apos;s life ?
we are ....
the one percent .
then what are you worried about ?
you &apos;re winning .
you have a lot of things , mr. paisley--
why do you feel so cornered ?
because there are more people who want than people who have .
read ayn rand .
oh , dear god .
have you read her books ? they &apos;re awful .
well , they weren &apos;t meant to be moby @-@ dick ,
they were meant to make you think .
a guy bombs a building , the rich go out on strike--
i @-@ it &apos;s a 12 @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s view of the world .
it &apos;s like basing your philosophy on the books of john grisham .
you should reread them .
mr. paisley ,
you &apos;ve always told me that you are a bottom @-@ line kind of guy .
i am .
so here &apos;s the bottom line . we &apos;re losing jury members .
and the fund managers are getting nervous .
if it continues ,
they may not support this merger .
and what &apos;s worse , you &apos;re in a media death spiral .
no matter what you say , you will never get a fair interpretation .
you have to put out a statement .
another apology .
no . a statement .
we &apos;ll hire a pr firm ,
using a focus group to find the right words .
as long as i don &apos;t have to answer questions again .
you won &apos;t .
and as long as you do it for me .
i &apos;ll be right back .
we &apos;re seeing a lot of each other , eli .
are you sleeping with finn polmar ?
ask me another question .
i don &apos;t have any other questions .
then go to hell .
there is a photo of finn leaving your apartment .
where ?
outside your apartment .
no . where &apos;s the photo ?
peter had it .
now , i have some worries here .
peter , you , finn .
the politics of all three .
castro .
yeah .
this is the reply we were waiting for .
the state &apos;s attorney did not send it to finn .
he sent it to peter .
i did not sleep with finn .
he came to my apartment the morning of his appearance
before the integrity panel
so we could get our strategy lined up , that &apos;s all .
i am sorry for asking .
that &apos;s okay .
we seem to share everything these days .
don &apos;t .
i have to .
odd choice .
hello ? yes .
yes , that &apos;s great .
10 : 00 a.m. is fine .
okay . thank you .
tell ms. hecht we &apos;re looking forward to it .
sorry .
i can turn it off now .
you &apos;re meeting with rayna hecht ?
kalinda , we &apos;re not doing this anymore .
hello . you &apos;ve reached the voice mail for rayna hecht .
please leave a message .
rayna . uh , diane lockhart .
i was expecting you here at , uh , noon , and it &apos;s now 1 : 30 .
i hope nothing &apos;s wrong .
please call me .
what time was her meeting with florrick @-@ agos ?
10 : 00 a.m.
thank you , kalinda .
she &apos;s not coming , is she ?
i don &apos;t know .
is she still in play ?
diane ?
i understand .
let &apos;s get this over with .
it &apos;s not what you think .
you talked to alicia ?
i did , and it is not what you think .
and what do i think ?
that alicia &apos;s sleeping with finn . she &apos;s not .
she represented him during castro &apos;s witch hunt ,
and on the day of his hearing ,
she was running late , because she was ...
mourning ... will .
exhausted .
so finn went over there to meet with her . that &apos;s all .
okay .
thanks .
peter ...
no , no , no . really , thanks . i get it .
okay , and how many of you like option number two ?
and we have a winner .
have you ever focus @-@ grouped an apology before ?
no . a marriage proposal once .
oh , you &apos;re kidding me .
he was a comic book writer .
he was terrible with women . it was david lee &apos;s idea .
they liked number two .
oh , great , the one he didn &apos;t like .
he doesn &apos;t get to vote .
and , uh , two people
suggested &quot; backed into a corner &quot; instead of pushed .
no . &quot; pushed &quot; is better .
&quot; backed &quot; is to passive .
okay , what &apos;s the final version ?
&quot; anyone who knows me knows i &apos;ve have a tendency
&quot; to bristle when pushed into a corner .
i end up saying things that i not only regret ... &quot;
but truly do not believe .
my comments were thoughtless ,
and i &apos;m sorry if i offended anyone .
more to the point-- and i want to be clear--
it &apos;s no one &apos;s fault if they are poor .
and you feel that was a sincere apology , mrs. florrick ?
yes , i do . i believe that mr. paisley &apos;s feelings were summed up
by the words he spoke today .
words that he has lived by his entire life .
not by the few sentences he spoke two days ago .
well , you &apos;re a paid flack . don &apos;t you have to say that ?
i &apos;m his lawyer , steve .
donald . i &apos;m the other one .
my apologies , donald .
in my own experience , mr. paisley is a sincere man
who spoke today from his heart .
but let &apos;s be honest .
the poor aren &apos;t the only ones he &apos;s disparaged .
isn &apos;t he being sued for firing someone who &apos;s gay ?
that is not true , don .
actually , this is don . don keats .
steven is the black guy to my right .
um ... my apologies .
i don &apos;t have a monitor here .
why don &apos;t i just stop using names ?
sure . that &apos;s easiest for you .
there wasn &apos;t a monitor in the room !
i couldn &apos;t see them !
you don &apos;t have to convince me .
yeah , but they &apos;re making me out to look like a racist .
hello .
oh , boy .
mr. paisley ?
i think you should be working up an apology , alicia .
thank you , ms. bouchard .
your honor , we &apos;re fine with this juror .
ms. bouchard , you are empanelled .
and that , amazingly ,
completes our selection process .
we &apos;ll take a short recess .
thank you .
okay , she puts us over the top seven to five .
uh , i don &apos;t think so .
well , i &apos;m afraid by my count , that makes us deadlocked .
six @-@ six .
what do you propose , mr. canning ?
$ 5 million .
i think mr. paisley will find it cheap in the long run .
hey , have you seen the news ?
oh , god , what now ?
no , no , no , it &apos;s good .
the state attorney general &apos;s office today
expanded its pharmaceutical investigation
to include kael pepper laboratories ,
a multinational company that &apos;s been accused
of price gouging patients in the distribution
of their aids medication reyacept .
what @-@ what am i supposed to see ?
just watch .
no comment , no comment .
thank you .
oh , that &apos;s good .
very clever , but it &apos;s not gonna work .
what won &apos;t ?
juror number seven .
you think because he &apos;s gay
he &apos;ll hate that i represent a firm that was accused
of price gouging aids medication ,
but you forget he occupied wall street for six straight weeks .
he slept in a cardboard box on the sidewalk ,
and that &apos;s what he cares about .
he &apos;s gay .
hmm , i didn &apos;t know that .
that &apos;s not the juror you should worry about , mr. canning .
it &apos;s juror number five ,
joanne honig .
you don &apos;t remember ?
her son died last year .
aids .
it &apos;s a tragedy .
$ 2 million .
$ 500,000 .
$ 1 million and it &apos;s a drop in the bucket .
and besides , none of us knows for sure
what any of these jurors are gonna do anyway , do we ?
it &apos;s a deal , mr. canning , but stick to it this time .
diane ,
i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s gonna work out .
i don &apos;t understand .
i have concerns .
what concerns ?
just things i &apos;m hearing .
such as ?
such as ...
that you &apos;re having trouble putting will &apos;s death behind you .
that you &apos;re stepping away from the day @-@ to @-@ day management of the firm .
you &apos;re losing clients .
none of that is true .
lyle pollard ?
i withdrew from that case to avoid suborning perjury .
you would &apos;ve done the same ,
and where are you hearing all of this ?
i &apos;d rather not say .
was it florrick @-@ agos ?
is that where you &apos;re going ?
i don &apos;t know where i &apos;m going yet .
i &apos;m sorry .
i wish it could &apos;ve worked out , diane .
i &apos;d like you to keep the class action .
you don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;ve lost the class action .
without you , i didn &apos;t have the votes .
what votes ?
it doesn &apos;t matter now .
if you would like , i will , uh ,
help you find new counsel .
diane ...
i am sorry .
why &apos;d you do it ?
diane .
why did i ... what are we talking about ?
you want to make a play for rayna hecht ,
by all means , have a meeting and make your pitch ,
but to denigrate me ,
to spread lies about my dedication to my firm !
diane !
we had a meeting scheduled with rayna .
i mean , she was here , but the meeting never happened .
she left .
she left ?
yes .
she got a call from canning , and then she left .
i just assumed that she made up her mind to go with you .
canning poisoned the well
at his own firm .
so you &apos;re being marginalized
by the partnership at lockhart / gardner ?
well , i know what that &apos;s like .
diane ,
if there &apos;s anything we can do ...
alicia , this is not our fight .
cary ...
no .
he &apos;s right .
you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s my fight .
not now , eli .
do you need anything else , sir ?
