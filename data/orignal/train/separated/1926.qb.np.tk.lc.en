&quot; fear &quot;
today &apos;s forecast -- hey , mid 70s !
unseasonably warm and clear in the pacific northwest .
it &apos;s gonna be a great day , seattle !
he doesn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s an idiot .
for all he knows ,
it could be the worst day of his life .
why is that on ?
oh ! um , i wanted to see the weather .
i have to fly today .
you &apos;ve been saying that for two weeks .
well , only because link mcneil kept getting close
to getting a heart .
i really wanted to see that through .
i can &apos;t put off zurich anymore .
there is a staff meeting on monday ,
and if i &apos;m not there , it &apos;ll be a terrible first impression ,
and i &apos;ll lose control before i start .
so ...
this is goodbye then ?
last night wasn &apos;t enough ?
no . no .
come on . owen , no , no . you made me late already .
no . meredith made you late .
you were out drinking till 2 : 00 in the morning .
well , &apos; cause that was our big goodbye .
oh , we are not having a big goodbye here .
i -- i &apos;m gonna be at the hospital later
to check on my last conduit kid .
we have a big goodbye here , and then i &apos;ll see you there ,
and i &apos;ll feel all ... &quot; duh , bye , again . &quot;
no , no , no , no , no . i @-@ i @-@ i got to go . i got to go .
you know how people say ,
&quot; who knows ? i could get hit by a bus tomorrow &quot; ?
that seems pretty farfetched ...
oh , crap . oh , crap ! oh , no ! my phone is dead !
... until you have a friend who got hit by a bus .
and i need a european charger . - cristina --
oh , no , now i have to go to the stupid mall !
i &apos;ll see you later .
the point is , we never know what kind of day is coming .
how is everybody ?
ah , so , zozo &apos;s in her room getting dressed ,
and this little guy just pooped , so there &apos;s that .
how was your flight ? - rough , but -- mwah !
we have a place to live in d.c.
we got the townhouse in foggy bottom .
we got it ? !
we close in a month .
i just need you to sign the paperwork .
what is today ? is today tuesday ?
today is thursday .
oh , good . then amy &apos;s got my surgeries .
i can sleep in all day .
okay ,
but first , that guy has a foggy bottom ,
and i can take a look at these tonight .
hey , you want to look at the brochure again
and remind yourself how much you love it ?
hmm . oh , it &apos;s pretty !
it &apos;s the freaking batmobile is what it is .
it &apos;s either this or a boat .
everybody at the practice has a boat .
are you really a boat guy ?
how should i know ? i never had a boat .
mm . ooh !
are you looking to buy a road @-@ penis ?
it &apos;s that or a boat .
oh , no , you don &apos;t seem like a boat guy .
what are you here for ?
my first anoplasty .
wow . is lebackes grooming you ?
are you gonna be dr. junior butthole ?
oh , no ! that &apos;s what they &apos;ll call you .
i won &apos;t hear them &apos; cause i &apos;ll be squealing away in this .
congratulations , lil &apos; butthole .
thanks .
any thought on who will fill
the three empty seats on the board ?
uh , it &apos;s only one seat , actually .
shepherd and grey will keep their seats .
they &apos;ll telecommute from d.c. for meetings .
yang says she won &apos;t have time .
i think she just wants a clean break .
so that just leaves her seat open .
morning , gentlemen .
you &apos;ll be happy to know
that former bubble boy braden morris
had his first follow @-@ up with his pediatrician .
he is healthy as a horse .
uh , i have a consult , if you &apos;ll excuse me .
ah , you can stay . you should --
what &apos;s up ?
disappointing news , actually .
the foundation cut our budget ,
so we are unable to continue funding your genome lab .
oh , well , who &apos;s gonna fund it , then ?
we &apos;re shutting it down actually .
it &apos;s simply not producing the results that other projects --
did you not just hear what i said ?
i @-@ i gave an immunodeficient child
deactivated h.i.v. and saved him !
and almost got the hospital sued in the process .
and almost lost your license and landed in jail .
so is that really where you want to plant your flag ?
yes !
and so should you !
hey , two years ago ,
i was wiping your butt and changing your diaper ,
and now you want to do this to me ?
n @-@ no , no . i @-@ i will not stand for it .
it &apos;s budgetary , and it &apos;s done .
won &apos;t stand for it !
hey , have you talked to leah ?
oh . yeah .
she &apos;s still on her couch ,
still depressed , eating everything .
has she said what she &apos;s gonna do ?
won &apos;t even talk about it -- catatonic .
what are you doing ?
just finished an aneurysm clip with dr. shepherd .
shepherd or shepherdess ?
shepherdess .
&quot; shepherdess &quot; ? really ?
uh , sorry . it &apos;s just very confusing .
i kind of like it -- shepherdess .
oh , well , before , it was just &quot; shepherd &apos;s little sister . &quot;
edwards , do you like working on neuro ?
don &apos;t ever say that to me again .
i e @-@ mailed dr. yang twice about the conduit babies ,
and her only response was , &quot; not your problem . &quot;
i &apos;m the head of cardio . i &apos;m her boss .
and the way that she talks to me sometimes --
look , dr. pierce , i --
&quot; maggie . &quot; &quot; margaret . &quot;
&quot; maggie &quot; is fine .
dr. yang will be coming in later today
for a final checkup with her conduit baby
before she -- - and then she &apos;s leaving ?
for good ?
yes , yes , she will be gone by the end of the day .
is that it ?
yes . i have a patient in pre @-@ op .
it &apos;s that way .
i &apos;m getting it .
chief .
can i talk to you ?
you are .
privately ?
um , do you have a minute to go into , like , a trauma room ?
spit it out , kepner .
i &apos;m pregnant .
i know it &apos;s sudden and it &apos;s soon ,
and i know it makes your life hell ,
but i will work until it falls out of me .
kepners are built to have babies , sir .
w @-@ we &apos;ve dropped them in fields .
kepner , i &apos;m happy for you .
i &apos;m thrilled .
congratulations .
thank you .
it was earlier than we thought ,
but my mom always says that if you wait
for the perfect time to have a baby ,
then you &apos;ll just die ...
if you &apos;re just joining us ...
childless .
we have breaking news ...
turn that up .
... of an enormous explosion .
it happened only minutes ago at seattle &apos;s mall of the woods .
we are getting reports of massive fatalities
oh , my gosh ! explosion !
and scores of people injured .
oh , my gosh !
officials have not yet determined ...
page all available surgeons .
clear the e.r.
bring them to me .
discharge all patients who can be .
cancel all elective surgeries .
admits -- let &apos;s get them upstairs .
i want a security lockdown on this floor .
i want all available beds and gurneys down here .
call blood services .
i want all the o @-@ neg they have .
the concern right now --
and what we &apos;re all wondering is --
is this an act of terrorism ?
第十季第24集 大结局
&quot; fear &quot;
so it &apos;s chemical ?
i &apos;m not saying that .
some patients are presenting with blisters and rashes ,
but the cause is not yet known .
this could be nothing ,
but we are taking proper decontamination precautions .
the main message here
is that we are fully equipped to treat the injured .
if you &apos;re coming to the hospital to look for a loved one ,
if , uh ... if you &apos;ve , uh -- if you &apos;ve lost someone , then ...
please stay clear of the emergency entrance .
come straight to the main entrance .
thank you .
one more question !
chief hunt ?
ray pelletier , homeland security .
there are some patients we need to talk to .
follow me .
okay , take this one to trauma four now .
kepner , how are we ?
good . we &apos;ve taken in over 30 injured .
more on the way .
triage areas are laid out --
reds here , yellows here ,
greens in the hallway .

with steady turnover .

neuro &apos;s in four , and cardio is in five .
who &apos;s in the cardio o.r. ?
pierce , the new cardio chief .
okay , you guys , uh ,
kepner needs help with triage downstairs .
karev , you see yang this morning ?
no . wasn &apos;t she with you ?
yeah , she said something about going to the mall .
you got to be freaking kidding me .
we don &apos;t worry until we &apos;re sure
we have something to worry about ,
but if you see her , you let me know , okay ?
don &apos;t tell mer !
yeah .
your airway looks good .
this cut will need to be stitched up .

so , you said you &apos;re 31 weeks pregnant , leanne ?

homestretch , huh ?
i &apos;m actually expecting a baby , too .

it &apos;s their baby .
we will do what we can .
a @-@ and they &apos;re a super @-@ nice couple ,

i &apos;ll see when i get in there .
make a path , people ! coming through !

apparently , i &apos;m going to be a grandmother .
webber , we need to open another o.r.

i &apos;ll start throwing patients at you .
uh , on my way .
it &apos;s a weekday , right ?

nicky &apos;s gone , mike . it &apos;s just me and you .

what was in your friend &apos;s backpack ?
mike !
his eardrums are ruptured . he may not be able to hear you .
okay , he &apos;s coming with me . get his clothes .
you can &apos;t take him anywhere . we have to watch him .
you said he isn &apos;t badly injured , right ?
what i said was , so far , his work @-@ up has been negative ,
but internal @-@ blast injuries
take a while -- okay , so , you &apos;re saying
he was likely very close to the blast ?
no , what i &apos;m saying is
right next to it ?
was he -- was he running --
we need some help in here !
you got it , doctor . he &apos;s okay .
he &apos;s tachycardic .
abdomen &apos;s rigid .
we got to get him to the o.r. right away .
ma &apos;am , we don &apos;t know if this is over yet .
if he dies on your table before i question him ,
we have nothing left .
and if he isn &apos;t the guy , you have a dead civilian
on your hands whose care you obstructed .
move !
ma &apos;am , please !
it &apos;s &quot; doctor . &quot; you &apos;re the boss out there .
i &apos;m the boss in here . get out of my way .

sudden loss of vitals with penetrating injury to the chest .
you &apos;re gonna have to open him up .
shouldn &apos;t you do it ?
no , you &apos;re there . you got it . go for it .
oh , my god .
what ?
i was gonna go to the mall .
diane , officials are seeking to question these men
seen entering the mall minutes before the explosion occurred .
of course , the biggest question is ,
&quot; could there be more attacks on the way ? &quot;
that &apos;s right .
i @-@ in fact , some people are wondering
if this could be a terrorist strategy --
to send victims to the hospital
and then target the hospital itself .
alana , should you even be there ?
i know , right ? it &apos;s an intensely dangerous situation .
what did she just say ?
turn that tv off !
no , no , i did work here like two weeks ago .
no , she &apos;s okay . let her through .
what can i do ?
uh , yellows , reds , and greens in the hallway .
assess and treat what you can .
okay , but i don &apos;t -- i @-@ i don &apos;t have privileges .
i can &apos;t operate
whatever needs to be done , do it .
and if you see a 10 @-@ year @-@ old boy with brown hair ,
brown eyes , and braces , come find me .
let &apos;s go ! let &apos;s go !
coming through !
let &apos;s go ! next ! him ?
he &apos;s got peritonitis , probably from a perf in the bowel .
head c.t. shows a probable tbi .
i called neuro for a consult .
okay .
okay -- oh , bailey , dhs wants to speak with him .
he &apos;s a possible suspect .
so , uh , you page me when you finish .
got it .
transradial amputation --
below the elbow , at least .
why would they hit a shopping mall ?
there &apos;s nothing there .
except people -- regular people .
they want to scare us .
it &apos;s the scariest thing we can think of .
has that rash shown up on any of our doctors yet ?
not yet , which is good . it means it might not be airborne .
the news said they might be targeting hospitals now --
oh , edwards , shut your mouth , please .
i &apos;m just saying .
oh , did her water just break ?
the baby &apos;s in distress .
late decels on the fetal heart monitor .
we need o.b. down here , stat !
and page dr. robbins .
tell her we might be delivering a premie in here .
what are you doing here ? i thought you had a big meeting .
they blew up seattle , mer . i can &apos;t leave .
you should . no one has a beef with switzerland .
so , we &apos;re going to d.c.
um , we sign papers on the townhouse tonight .
it &apos;s nice . it &apos;s gonna be good .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m happy for you . people do this .
are you ? happy for me ?
i got to go to the o.r.
alex gave a kid an emergency thoracotomy .
watch my finger .
i can &apos;t see out of it . is it gone ?
no , no , it &apos;s definitely there .
it &apos;s orbital compartment syndrome .
glove me .
hey . are you okay ?
you have a little blood behind your eye ,
and i &apos;m gonna release that .
this is gonna sting a little .
okay .
now look at his finger .
okay .
okay .
now open for me .
i &apos;m starting to see something .
i can see .
thank you !
thank you so much .
you got it .
ross ! i need you in the o.r. !
hey ! does that kid have braces ?
hey , hey , listen . yang , i just got a call from unos .
they &apos;ve been trying to reach you .
oh , my phone is dead .
a heart &apos;s become available that &apos;s a match for link mcneil .
now ?
we tell them to do it at seattle pres , right ,
because there &apos;s no -- - no , no , no , send it here .
no , i @-@ i @-@ i got to do it here . tell the mcneils to come .
byron , what can you tell us ?
what have you learned at the hospital ?
right , diane , there &apos;s concern now
that the skin reactions on patients we &apos;re hearing about
could possibly be caused by radiation from a so @-@ called dirty bomb .
damn it .
and the fear is it might not be as easily treatable
as an attack from chemicals , as we previously thought ,
but the fact is -- - the fact is , you don &apos;t know .
oh , uh , here &apos;s the chief of surgery .
you are lying to them now .
you are saying anthrax . you are saying radiation .
nobody else is .
the fact is we don &apos;t know how bad this is , okay ?
so stop wondering out loud , report what you know ,
and stop scaring people for no reason .
what -- i mean , who let you in here ? !
get out . stop . turn off the camera .
well , we seem to have lost byron there .
tensions seem to be running pretty high ,
as one would expect in such a dangerous situation .
stay with us for complete coverage .
we will be right back .
i &apos;m ready . where &apos;s the o.b. ?
no show , but i prepped her for them .
decels are really frequent .
you need to get that baby out of there now .
well , where the hell &apos;s the o.b. ?
the baby &apos;s down to 60 beats per minute .
all right , avery , you &apos;re gonna help me .
50 beats and sustained .
i need a 10 blade .
okay , hang on , sweetie . let &apos;s get you out of there .
she &apos;ll want a stapler .
we &apos;ve isolated the hilum -- stapler .
how are you gonna cope with it ?
with what ?
the boredom .
making buttholes will be your whole career .
how will you not stick your head in the oven ?
screw you . i &apos;ll cry about it on my boat .
get a reload ready .
yeah , right , you just saw a kid ,
knew he had a hemothorax , reached in , and fixed it .
you know , you &apos;re never gonna do that again .
saving kids with ping @-@ pong balls
or making an end stoma with an appendix -- stapler .
how did you even know i did that ?
you think i wasn &apos;t paying attention
to you proving me wrong ?
i mean , i thought you were competent --
well , no .
when you got here , i thought you were an imbecile ,
but you got competent , like a decent handyman .
but eventually , i had to accept that you were good --
good hands , and you think fast , act faster .
i mean , you &apos;ll never be as good as me ,
but you &apos;re very , very good .
okay , let &apos;s , uh , get ready for the leak test .
irrigation ? thank you , shane .
and you &apos;re putting all that talent in a drawer .
so maybe you are an imbecile .
oh , god , what a relief . i &apos;m still right .
dr. yang , did you schedule
a pediatric heart transplant to come here today ?
oh , hey , yes . uh , good . are the mcneils here ?
why ? why would you think that we could do --
don &apos;t worry about it . he &apos;s not your problem .
it is my department , and i &apos;ll decide
what should be sent out to other hosp--
i &apos;m a little busy here ,
so can you just tell me where i can do the transplant ?
i &apos;ve just finished in o.r. three .
you can do your transplant in there .
great ! uh , can you , uh , see if link mcneil is here yet ?
and , um , prep him for me ? thank you .
i &apos;m gonna miss you .
seriously , though . link mcneil-- today ?
i just need something to feel finished .
shane can close for me .
are you sure you want him to close this kid ?
i taught shane how to close .
there won &apos;t even be a scar , will there , shane ?
nope .
mnh @-@ mnh .
suction .
avery , i &apos;m cutting the uterus , so pull up on those clamps .
got it .
okay , now reach in here and pull away from me .
you got to -- you got to pull harder .
tug it , avery ! okay , yeah . there . there .
oh . oh . okay .
all right , i got it .
clamp and cut the cord .
okay .
all right , you got her .
okay . you &apos;re okay .
okay . all right .
you &apos;re okay .
i got you .
i got you .
how long till we can have him ?
i have to get him to recovery to make sure he &apos;s okay .
doctor , i don &apos;t think you understand
the nature of what &apos;s happening here !
do you want him healthy enough to answer your questions ?
yeah .
right .
thank you for your time .
wait . what just happened ?
situation &apos;s changed . he &apos;s no longer a subject of interest .
that &apos;s all i can tell you .
but what about him ?
don &apos;t you think you owe him an apology ?
doctor , you have a very tough job keeping people alive .
i do , too .
dry @-@ cleaning fluid ?
the cdc report says
that &apos;s what &apos;s causing the patients &apos; blisters .
there was a big dry cleaner at the mall .
victims were laying in puddles of the stuff .
prolonged skin exposure can cause rashes .
so it wasn &apos;t a chemical attack ? it was just a bomb ?
dr. hunt , you &apos;ll want to see this .
and we will be bringing you more information
as it becomes available .
we repeat now--
investigators have determined at this hour
that the mall of the woods blast
was caused by a gas @-@ main explosion .
officials say they found no evidence of foul play
and that fears of a terrorist threat were unfounded .
thank you , jesus .
seattle power officials say
the gas main ran directly ...
yep .
all right , chief , what &apos;s next ?
how does this change what we &apos;re doing ?
it changes nothing , kepner .
there was still an explosion .
the wounded are still wounded , and people are still lost .
hey . i think i found your brown @-@ haired kid .
ross and karev were taking him into surgery ,
and he &apos;s just on his way out .
oh , thank god .
i @-@ i need to go tell his parents .
go .
dr. hunt .
sabine , what are you doing here ?
uh , they told us there &apos;s a heart for link .
today ? they told you to come here ?
i know , but dr. yang told us to come right over .
you spoke to her ? you spoke to dr. yang ?
yes . she told us to come .
s @-@ should we go somewhere else ?
i know that there &apos;s so many people here that need help --
no , no , no , no . uh , link is gonna be fine .
everyone &apos;s gonna be fine .
come with me . i &apos;ll help you find her .
dr. hunt ! we need you here , stat !
they dug her out . coded twice in the field .
penetrating trauma to the abdomen .
okay , we need take her straight up .
let &apos;s call ahead , and let &apos;s clear an o.r.
oh , um , take mrs. mcneil . help her find dr. yang .
and , murphy ? thank you for coming in .
he &apos;s still intubated .
he &apos;s had his left lung removed ,
but dr. yang says he &apos;ll recover just fine .
that &apos;s-- that &apos;s not him .
that &apos;s-- that &apos;s not our son .
four by fours .
four by fours .
april , where do you keep the four by fours ?
oh , hi . you &apos;re here . hi .
what &apos;s wrong ?
it was a shopping mall .
didn &apos;t you hear ? it wasn &apos;t terrorists .
but that &apos;s what we thought .
we live in a world
where that is the first thought that crosses our minds .
i don &apos;t think i can do it .
i don &apos;t think i can raise a child
in a world where they could die going to buy new shoes .
i remember when i was 10 years old ,
sitting in a restaurant with my father , getting waffles .
i loved waffles .
i didn &apos;t like eggs -- still don &apos;t .
this was 1960 , in texas , in a town so small
it probably has forgotten its own name by now .
and i remember
some ignorant young men telling us to leave ,
dumping my father &apos;s food in his lap ,
throwing hot coffee on him .
was i scared ? yes .
i begged him to take me out of there .
do you know what he said to me ?
what ?
&quot; not until after you finish your eggs , young lady . &quot;
what -- what did they do ? what happened ?
nothing .
they went on to bother somebody else .
he wasn &apos;t afraid , so they didn &apos;t have any power .
april , there &apos;s always gonna be stupid people .
there &apos;s always gonna be accidents .
but that &apos;s not what defeats you .
it &apos;s the fear .
now , if you had told me on that day in 1960
that i would have the job that i have today ,
the child that i have ,
i would have laughed till i cried .
it seemed beyond impossible .
but this is the way the world changes , sweetheart --
good people raising their babies right .
now , come on . where are the four by fours ?
we got things to do .
we got work to do !
did more come in ?
no , it &apos;s slowing down . what are you still doing here ?
what time is your flight ?
i can &apos;t leave , meredith . they just bombed seattle .
no , they didn &apos;t . no one did .
it was an accident -- gas main .
so , no different than a train derailment
or a ferry @-@ boat crash , so you can go .
when i heard it was the mall ,
you know what i thought of ?
i thought about the time that callie and i played hookey
and we bought all the furniture for the firehouse .
what time is your plane ?
two hours .
but link mcneil has got a heart , and i have to do that first .
no , the new head of cardio can do that .
you don &apos;t have the time .

what -- - so there &apos;s that .
meredith !
you have been stalling for two weeks .
you know what ? i have to --
i have to finish something here .
nothing feels finished . none of it feels finished .
owen and i ...
we split ... over something that hasn &apos;t even happened .
and we never even split up .
and y--
you and i are not finished .
george is dead , and izzie is gone ,
and it is supposed to be you and me and alex .
and now nothing is finished .
i am not finished .
you don &apos;t feel finished
because this isn &apos;t the end for you .
there is no finish line .
there is no end point .
you just have to go .
i know . i know .
i know , a @-@ and i &apos;m -- and i keep trying to ,
but i don &apos;t know how to ... just do it .
you got to help me , mer .

derek .
goodbye .
goodbye .

not for a while .
it &apos;s not fair .
webber was wrong . maybe you just need to --
really , shane ?
i hung on his every word all year .
all of us did .
he &apos;s the greatest teacher i have ever had ,
so maybe if it were someone else saying this ,
i wouldn &apos;t believe them , but webber ?
i got to find what i &apos;m good at .
and i will .
you will . good luck .
everything &apos;s okay .
what happened ?
there was an explosion .
but it &apos;s over , and you &apos;re fine , okay ?
you &apos;re gonna be just fine .
the patient in bed four is awake .
thank you .
i would have thought , you know ,
now that you &apos;re minister of education or whatever
that you could tell the stupid board --
i don &apos;t control the budget , bailey .
w @-@ well , did you at least fight for me to keep my lab ?
no , i did not .
now , when it came time this morning
to decide who would staff the o.r.s ,
who had the stamina and the talent
to run patient after patient , it was a no @-@ brainer .
i mean , some people belong behind a microscope ,
but you don &apos;t . you are a surgeon , bailey .
it is what i trained you to be .
and anything else would be a waste of your time .
and before you continue trashing the board ,
you ought to know that yang is leaving a seat open ,
and i &apos;m recommending you ,
which the board will agree is also a no @-@ brainer .
w @-@ well , that &apos;s --
dr. bailey , um , dr. webber , i @-@ i just wanted to s--
she doesn &apos;t have time for long goodbyes .
she has a plane to catch . - no , mer --
well , you should go , then .
yeah , don &apos;t stand around here talking .
go , be a surgeon . that &apos;s what we trained you for .
can i come with you ?
shane , not now .
i &apos;m not kidding . take me to switzerland .
i can help you .
you &apos;re in the middle of your residency .
and my teacher is leaving , the one i want to learn from ,
to go do the work i want to be a part of .
i want to be in charge of my education ,
and i choose you .
you can say no ,
but i will badger you until you say yes .
yes .
i quit .
respectfully . and thank you for everything .

no , no , i @-@ i didn &apos;t lose a single one .
that &apos;s why i feel bad -- &apos; cause i feel so good .
this is the thing , meredith .
this is what it feels like .
it feels like --
candy . but with blood .
only so much better . and derek --
i mean , i was still in his shadow ,
but i didn &apos;t even care .
and the only thing that would have made it better
was if his shadow was gone , so you guys can go .
have fun . be happy .
what the heck ?
cristina , what are you doing here ?
i can &apos;t go .
yes , you can !
we have to finish .
you &apos;re gonna miss your -- - we have to dance it out .

and don &apos;t let owen get all dark and twisty . take care of him .
and alex -- take care of alex .
he needs to be mocked at least once a day ,
or he &apos;ll be insufferable .
don &apos;t get on any little , tiny planes that can crash ,
or stick your hand in a body cavity
that has a bomb in it ,
or offer your life to a gunman !
don &apos;t do that .
don &apos;t be a hero .
you &apos;re my person .
i need you alive .

* it &apos;s love that leaves and breaks *
* the seal of always thinking you would be *
they &apos;re asleep .

meredith , you &apos;ll talk to her tomorrow .

no , it &apos;s not ...
i don &apos;t think i can sign this .
sorry , i know you &apos;re wiped ,
but i need to have those on the plane by 7 : 00 .
no , i don &apos;t ...
i think i need to stay here .
dr. torres ?
um , the baby &apos;s parents are here ,
and they were wondering if leanne was up to ...
yes , yes , please , yes .
yeah ? okay . yeah , come in .
hey , leanne .
are you okay ?
is she okay ?
do you guys love her ? is she all right ?
she &apos;s beautiful . she &apos;s perfect .
thank you .
we &apos;re so glad you &apos;re okay .
are you okay ?
yeah . that &apos;s just -- it &apos;s really sweet .
it &apos;s really amazing .
i wonder why they wanted a surrogate .
i wonder if -- i wonder if she couldn &apos;t --
she really helped them .
she really likes them .
that &apos;s really amazing , right ?
guess what . i delivered a baby today .
and the good news is ,
if the o.b. doesn &apos;t show up for ours , then i get --
our baby will be fine .
he &apos;ll be fine ...
or she will be &apos; cause she &apos;ll have us .
hey , of course she will .
you know , my mom always says
that &apos;s how the world changes .
good people raising their babies right .
wait , is that -- is that a thing ?
i thought that was just my mom .
i love you .
it went perfectly .
link &apos;s heart is responding well , and so is he .
thank you . thank you so much .
my pleasure .
now , i know from dr. yang
that you &apos;ve heard the whole anti @-@ rejection spiel before ...
ooh ! i don &apos;t want to get too excited .
yang &apos;s body isn &apos;t even cold yet , but --
no , you can -- you can be excited .
you got a place on the board !
i will make policy , not just hear it .
i will make changes .
you can keep your genome lab .
we can have a genome theme park .
and ...
it &apos;s just ...
what ?
webber picked me .
boy , get in there deep , deep , deep .
oh , yeah , i got you . i got you .
what -- what is this ?
what is --
it &apos;s from yang .
alex , what ?
it &apos;s cristina &apos;s shares in the hospital .
she &apos;s leaving them to me .
what ?
she left me her seat on the board .
can she do that ?
i don &apos;t know .
she did .
i took the job !
and you were supposed to be stepping back .
you said , &quot; take this year and make it count .
and i &apos;ll make sure you can do it . &quot; and you lied !
sorry . i lied .
it &apos;s a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime opportunity .
so , you got this thing , and i gave up that piece .
and i found a way to make it work
with my job , my kids , and my research
with less help from you , and i did it .
you &apos;re not a victim .
i &apos;m killing myself just as much as you are .
and then you wanted more pieces and more pieces .
i &apos;m flying back and forth across the country.twice a week ...
and now this is just too much .
so i can spend time with my kids .... and be a good father .
you can &apos;t just drag us away ...
so i can come live in your shadow .
&quot; shadow &quot; ? you have a job .
you &apos;re gonna be working at james madison .
right , that &apos;s how my father got his first job here .
they wanted my mom ,
so she had to call the university and pull some strings
and find something for thatcher to do .
it &apos;s called a trailing spouse .
this is not like that .
this is exactly that .
and it &apos;s not what i signed up for .
you know what ? you &apos;re -- you &apos;re being selfish .
i have to be , derek , because you believe
that your career is more important than mine .
at this moment in time , it is !
no , not at this moment -- always .
you will always be that hot @-@ shot surgeon ,
and i will always be that young intern who fell in love with you .
if that &apos;s how you see yourself , that &apos;s your problem .
i can &apos;t do anything about that .
that is not how i see myself . that is the issue here .
d.c. -- you can do your surgeries ,
you can do your research , you can do the portal veins .
there is nothing you can do here that you can &apos;t do there .
but i don &apos;t want to !
we &apos;re not just talking about my job , derek .
we &apos;re talking about my life .
i grew up here . i made my family here .
i helped to rebuild the hospital here
that has my sister &apos;s name on it ,
my mother &apos;s name , my name .
i live here . my life is here .
i don &apos;t want to leave .
whenever we think we know the future ...
even for a second ...
it changes .
dr. pierce . rough day , huh ?
seven traumas ,
two of which had right ventricular perfs ,
topped off with a pediatric heart transplant .
other than that , how you settling in ?
it has been the weirdest two weeks of my life .
i don &apos;t know anyone . no one knows me .
i haven &apos;t had one conversation that wasn &apos;t related to work .
you know me now .
no .
god , i sound like a kid crying at camp .
no , it &apos;s not -- it &apos;s not that .
it &apos;s ... something else .
i was adopted .
two years ago , i looked up my birth mom .
i had to go to the court for the records .
she &apos;s dead now , so i could only get her name .
but she was amazing .
she was a surgeon here .
her name is all over this hospital .
that &apos;s not why i took the job .
i mean , it &apos;s a little bit why i interviewed ,
but it &apos;s just ... so weird .
w @-@ what was her name ?
your birth mother .
ellis grey .
did you know her ?
sometimes the future changes quickly and completely ...
and we &apos;re left only with the choice of what to do next .
you &apos;re asking me to choose between this job ...
and my family ?
i am simply saying i am not going anywhere .
i am staying here .
we can choose to be afraid of it ...
to stand there , trembling ...
not moving ,
assuming the worst that can happen .
or we step forward ...
yes ?
dr. yang ?
they &apos;re all ready for you .
into the unknown ...
let &apos;s do it .
心胸外科主任医师
and assume it will be brilliant .
