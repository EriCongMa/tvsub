night .
no .
middle of the phone . i got it .
get it .
oh ! my arm &apos;s asleep ! my arm &apos;s asleep !
get the phone .
phil , get the phone .
that &apos;s me . hello ! hi .
yes , this is she .
who is it ?
okay . oh , god .
tell me what &apos;s happening here !
haley has been arrested .
what ?
phone ! phone . i bet that &apos;s mama .
i was just dreaming it was raining chickens !
mitchell , answer the phone !
look what i am doing . look what i am doing , huh ?
hello ?
hey , mitchell .
i &apos;m sorry to wake you up , but haley got arrested .
oh , god . haley got arrested .
that explains the chickens .
it does . it adds up .
what &apos;s she get arrested for ?
oh , she got caught drinking at some party .
look , could you drive up to the college with us ?
i think we &apos;re gonna need a lawyer .
yes , of course .
and cam and lily can come over and stay with alex and luke .
i &apos;ll guard them with my life .
i hate to bother him .
no , no , don &apos;t be silly . he &apos;s happy to do it .
okay , we &apos;ll be over in a little bit .
oh , i get it .
when you told claire i would come over and watch the kids ,
she was resistant
because she doesn &apos;t trust my parenting skills .
no . don &apos;t be silly . she just didn &apos;t want to put you out .
she &apos;s got a daughter behind bars
and she &apos;s got the nerve to say i &apos;m a bad parent ?
you didn &apos;t defend me .
because she didn &apos;t say anything .
why are you protecting her ?
why is no one protecting me ?
no .
ay ! answer ! answer !
this better be good .
haley got arrested for drinking .
we gotta go bail her out .
do you still have a connection to that judge upstate ?
he died .
ay ! who died ?
an old friend of mine .
ay , jay , i &apos;m so sorry .
he died five years ago .
then why are they calling us in the middle of the night
to wake us up ? !
nobody died . haley &apos;s in jail .
okay . that makes more sense .
claire has to go bail her out .
okay . give me that .
claire , listen to me--
take a lot of cash .
and when you flash it to the police ,
do not speak about it .
let the eyes do all the talking , okay ?
i heard the phone . who died ?
jay &apos;s friend .
oh , jay , i &apos;m so sorry .
okay . i can &apos;t do this again .
it &apos;s breakfast
it &apos;s breakfast time
it &apos;s breaky breaky time
uncle cam . i thought i heard your voice .
what are you doing here ? where are my parents ?
well , the school called , and your sister won a big award .
nice try . the only person
who would believe that would be haley .
she &apos;s in jail .
jail ?
lily , what did i say ?
that it was only a matter of time .
okay , no . didn &apos;t say that .
okay , so here &apos;s the truth .
your sister was caught drinking .
but it &apos;s no big deal .
your parents are there taking care of it right now .
so ...
this is so awesome !
i hope she hits the weights
so she &apos;s totally ripped when she gets out .
okay . let &apos;s change the subject .
have a seat . have some breakfast .
see if there &apos;s anything on that plate you like a lot .
is this bacon ?
of course it is , silly .
been on a little bit of a health kick lately ,
so i took a vegan cooking class ,
and my new thing is &quot; fakon . &quot;
it &apos;s like real bacon .
except for the look , the texture , and the taste .
maybe the store @-@ bought kind .
but i make my own , so it &apos;s not even real fakon .
it &apos;s faux @-@ fakon . &quot; faux @-@ kon . &quot;
it &apos;s faux @-@ kon disgusting .
you can &apos;t tell the difference .
and guess which one &apos;s the real one ?
that one .
that one .
still that one .
this is the best bacon i &apos;ve ever had .
oh , well .
i can &apos;t wait to tell your uncle , mitchell that you love it .
why would uncle mitch care ?
because , my dear ,
that bacon you &apos;re eating isn &apos;t bacon at all ,
no , no , no .
it &apos;s made entirely of soy .
luke &apos;s allergic to soy !
his throat closes ! he can &apos;t breathe !
hello ?
never mind !
okay , okay .
we have to , uh , get you to the , uh , hospital !
lily ! come on , baby .
okay , luke ! put the fakon down !
i &apos;m using it to scratch my throat !
okay . okay . let &apos;s go . come on .
go .
cam ? c @-@ cam ?
that was weird .
hey , claire , do you wanna pick it up a little bit ?
since when do you drive at speed limit ?
my daughter has been arrested for drinking .
i would like her to sit in jail and think about that .
as a matter of fact , i might stop
and do a little outlet shopping .
who wants a pair of last year &apos;s sunglasses , huh ?
honey ...
try to relax .
i don &apos;t feel like relaxing , phil !
she has been in college for six weeks .
yeah , and everyone goes a little crazy at first .
i remember one night freshman year ,
a bunch of us on the frisbee golf team
got a case of zima . enough zaid .
more than enough .
i &apos;m not gonna lie .
sometimes it bothers me how calm phil is under pressure .
it &apos;s like ...
like i &apos;m the one who &apos;s overreacting .
that &apos;s good . let it out . it &apos;s g--
i &apos;m going to kill you .
jay , do you have some time today ?
we need to go and pick out a stroller .
just get whatever you want .
i mean , it &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna do anyway .
what i want is a husband
who likes to go shopping for a stroller with me .
if you had a husband who liked picking out strollers ,
you wouldn &apos;t be having a baby .
so who wants to come with me
to the spoken word festival this evening ?
i only have two tickets ,
so somebody &apos;s gonna be disappointed .
i think it &apos;s gonna be you .
ay , manny , i would go with you , but i &apos;m so tired .
you just woke up . how are you tired ?
maybe because i &apos;m turning food into a human !
jay will take you .
sorry , i would love to go to the spoken word festival ,
but i &apos;m already going to the
i &apos;d @-@ rather- blow @-@ my @-@ brains @-@ out jamboree .
i can &apos;t believe this .
i &apos;m living in a cultural wasteland .
with a heated pool .
manny , vamos . you &apos;re gonna be late for school .
oh , jeez .
hello , dede .
good morning , jay . namaste .
let &apos;s not do this .
oh , fine , silly .
i &apos;m on my way to a retreat in ojai ,
and since i &apos;m passing through town ,
i thought i &apos;d pick up that photo album .
you know , it &apos;s really not a good time .
oh , please .
all right . i &apos;ll meet you on the street .
drive by slow with the window open .
i was dreading dede finding out that gloria &apos;s pregnant .
it &apos;s one thing dede &apos;s hung on to ,
that she &apos;s the mother of my kids .
and considering their history ...
i @-@ i wanna ...
rip your head off !
what ?
no ! please stop it ! whoa !
eh ? no ! dede !
i wasn &apos;t exactly looking forward to round four ,
especially now that gloria &apos;s a bigger , slower target .
i &apos;d normally be having breakfast right now .
hi , dad .
hey , claire . any updates ?
not yet , but we &apos;re almost there .
last time you were over at the house ,
you were looking at that photo album .
what &apos;d you do with it ?
oh , dad , that was me .
i think i put it on the shelf behind the bar .
what are you doing there ?
they asked me to come along
in case they needed a lawyer .
shouldn &apos;t they have a real lawyer ?
oh , god . should we ?
i am a real lawyer , people .
environmental law is a thing .
don &apos;t get all sensitive on me .
i mean someone who doesn &apos;t defend pandas .
yeah , dad , &apos; cause that &apos;s what i do .
i @-@ i defend pandas in court .
that &apos;s adorable .
you know what i &apos;m talking about .
haley needs somebody who knows criminal law ,
like perry mason .
okay , so i &apos;m not a real lawyer , but perry mason is ?
oh , hell .
hello , dede . how &apos;re you doing ?
oh , mostly fine .
i have something called a telescoping uterus .
long story .
aw , jeez .
out of my way !
out of my way !
i can &apos;t breathe !
this boy can &apos;t breathe .
he &apos;s having a severe allergic reaction .
no . you &apos;re squeezing me .
he needs medicine . his throat is closing up .
okay . hold on .
we have an allergic reaction .
a young boy . obstructed breathing .
what happened ?
well , somebody gave him some soy bacon ...
that was so good , he couldn &apos;t tell the difference .
mitchell , i can &apos;t talk right now .
cam , it &apos;s claire . my phone died .
i just wanted to make sure the kids got to school okay .
oh , yeah , of course they did . why wouldn &apos;t they have ?
i hear we got a boy who can &apos;t breathe ?
right here .
what was that ?
oh , i &apos;m just watching an original lifetime movie
called &quot; the boy who can &apos;t breathe . &quot;
that sounded like alex .
nope . just amanda bynes . okay , gotta go .
cam . cam ?
that &apos;s weird .
can you believe how many waffle places we passed ?
i can &apos;t believe how much dad belittles me .
what were there ? five ? six ?
i edited the law review .
i passed the bar on my first try .
i have a briefcase .
i &apos;m counting them on the way back .
can we focus ?
uh , hi . we &apos;re here for haley dunphy .
i &apos;m mitchell pritchett . i &apos;m miss dunphy &apos;s attorney .
she won &apos;t be needing a lawyer today .
oh , i think i &apos;ll be the judge of that .
i &apos;d like to confer with my client now . thank you .
all you have to do is post bail , and she &apos;s all yours .
really ? oh . that--that &apos;s fantastic .
sir , i am in no mood
to defend my daughter today , believe me .
okay .
but do you think it is the best use of resources
to lock up college kids who &apos;ve had a few drinks ?
ma &apos;am , your daughter was charged with resisting arrest
and assaulting a police officer .
what ?
you probably should have called a real lawyer ,
&apos;cause i don &apos;t ... i &apos;m not ...
look , this has gotta be some kind of mistake .
our daughter &apos;s tiny .
there &apos;s no way she assaulted anyone .
insulted , maybe .
was--was the cop wearing white socks and dark shoes ?
&apos;cause that really sets her off .
maybe you should watch this .
stop !
put your hands where i can see &apos; em !
okay . now that &apos;s very blurry footage .
how can we be sure that that &apos;s haley ?
don &apos;t you move .
don &apos;t hurt me ! i &apos;m just a student !
i &apos;m haley dunphy !
so hot .
hot in here .
how long is this gonna take ?
i should be in school . i &apos;m missing biology right now .
you &apos;re in a hospital . just step out into the hallway .
listen to the nurses and doctors talk .
you &apos;ll learn more about science and humanity here
than you would in a classroom in an entire semester .
attention !
if there &apos;s a yogurt in the fridge that says &quot; theresa , &quot;
then only theresa gets to eat it !
drama . soak it in .
oh , good god .
okay , luke ,
the opening is supposed to be in the back .
no way . i don &apos;t want people to see my butt .
do i have to get another shot ?
are you going to cry again ?
should she be here ?
okay . you know what ?
nobody &apos;s getting any more shots .
we just have to wait for the swelling to go down .
all right ? i &apos;m gonna go check on a little paperwork .
i &apos;ll be right back .
but if it doesn &apos;t go down ,
that leg might have to come off .
sweet . take them both .
then i could get some of those blade legs
and finally be able to dunk .
how you feeling , champ ?
what do we got here ?
the patient presents bronchial inflammation ,
dermal pruritus , and minor angioedema .
who can tell me the cause ?
it &apos;s an allergic reaction to soy .
very good .
the rest of you have a lot to learn . let &apos;s keep moving .
stay with luke .
what is taking so long ?
well , in my experience , these things can take time .
so ... settle in . this--this could be a while .
there she is .
damn it .
oh , thank god .
you &apos;re okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine , mom .
oh ! what the hell were you thinking ?
what happened ?
it &apos;s not a big deal , okay ?
there was a party , and people were drinking ...
so the police showed up ,
and everybody ran , so i did , too .
and i started climbing down this fire escape ...
and then i heard a cop yell to put your hands up ,
so i did and i fell ... onto him .
you could have been killed .
haley , you &apos;re supposed to be an adult .
how could you do something so childish ...
okay , okay , okay , okay .
and so stupid ?
let &apos;s calm down . we &apos;re all a little tired and cranky .
best thing we can do right now
is get out of here , go get some waffles--
i don &apos;t want waffles , phil , okay ?
i &apos;m upset and i want to deal with this .
all right , i got some bad news here .
um , this afternoon ,
haley has to appear before a disciplinary board ,
which will decide whether or not she gets kicked out of school .
what ?
oh , wait . wait , no . i got that wrong .
oh , no , i got it right !
yes ! score . one for me .
it &apos;s what it sounds like .
it literally telescopes .
you see , what happens is ...
dede , i hate to rush this ,
but i &apos;m late for a meeting .
and it &apos;s been great seeing you , but can i walk you out ?
okay . sure .
ay , jay , it &apos;s so weird .
the moment i came through the door ,
the baby started kicking like crazy ,
like it &apos;s trying to claw its way out of me .
bruja !
oh , my god .
what is she doing here ?
you &apos;re going to have a baby ?
i don &apos;t believe it .
uh , dede , don &apos;t get all crazy about this .
what &apos;s happening ?
her brain . it snapped .
oh ! you &apos;re going to be a father again at your age .
and here you were thinking
you would just sail off into the sunset
with your beautiful young wife ,
not a care in the world .
this is fantastic !
i think my uterus just fixed itself .
don &apos;t ask .
oh no . who lives like this ?
when i had a dorm room , it was ...
oh--it was spotless .
can we just agree that girls are dirtier than boys ?
what should we do ?
well , i &apos;d like to start
by picking up some of these clothes . then--
i meant about the hearing , felix .
do we have a game plan ?
i think the best thing we can do is
walk in there as a family
and let them know we support haley no matter what .
at this rate , we are going to be supporting haley
for the rest of our lives .
okay . oh , i ...
i just sat on half a peach , so i--no .
i can &apos;t do this . i &apos;m--i &apos;m waiting outside .
disgusting .
what are you wearing ?
what ? what &apos;s wrong with it ?
honey , you are fighting for your future
in front of a disciplinary committee ,
not entertaining the secret service .
in &quot; legally blonde , &quot; elle won her case
because she was true to herself and dressed cute .
haley , this is real life ,
not an excellent movie .
honey , just put on something else ,
and take down the makeup .
why are you guys acting like this is my fault ?
everybody was drinking , everybody ran .
i just got caught .
if anything , i &apos;m the victim here .
what ? ! just stop-- just stop talking , haley .
you &apos;re not the victim here . you &apos;re the one who screwed up !
you made one bad decision after another ,
and now you &apos;re about to blow everything
your mother and i worked so hard to give you .
and the worst thing is , you don &apos;t seem to care .
we all got up at 3 : 00 a.m. this morning
to bail you out of jail !
we haven &apos;t eaten a thing ,
and you know what i haven &apos;t heard from you yet ?
&quot; i &apos;m sorry , mom . i screwed up , dad .
please forgive me . &quot;
now put on some real clothes .
we &apos;ll see you at the hearing . do not be late !
come on .
where are you going ?
to get that man a waffle .
there . there . did you feel it kicking ?
oh , yes ! oh , i remember those .
yeah , claire kicked me as soon as she grew legs ,
and she didn &apos;t stop until she was 4 .
not manny .
he was so calm ,
i think that he was reading in there .
this is beautiful .
look at you two , having a conversation like old friends .
well , it &apos;s easier to talk to her when she &apos;s not choking me .
i &apos;m sorry .
i went through a bad patch there
when i was trying to find the right balance with my meds .
i recently discovered my cat frances
buried in the backyard .
i &apos;m just praying that she died first .
maybe you can dogsit for the shoe @-@ eater one day .
oh , well , she is a ... funny @-@ looking thing .
don &apos;t listen to them . you &apos;re beautiful .
turns out gloria being pregnant
somehow made dede think of her as less trophy , more human .
and all the animosity she had for gloria
just wafted up in the air ...
i hope you &apos;re hiring a nanny ,
because this one won &apos;t lift a finger .
and landed right on top of me .
i don &apos;t remember him changing a single diaper .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
you can &apos;t even remember killing your cat .
oh , i don &apos;t think i did .
but i &apos;m sure that you never changed any diapers .
it &apos;s just that you were better at it than i was .
oh , so i guess i was better at late @-@ night feedings
and cleaning spit @-@ up , too .
you know what ?
he wouldn &apos;t help me pick up a stroller
or a blanket or a bouncy chair .
oh , well , i had to get that stuff on my own .
he was just useless .
you poor thing .
makes all sense now why you became so crazy .
right ?
listen to me , jay pritchett .
if you don &apos;t change your useless ways ,
you &apos;re gonna make me crazy , too !
like dede !
gloria . gloria .
i just love our little visits .
mom , i &apos;m home !
oh , hi , manny .
dede . how are you ?
good .
dede . it &apos;s me .
how are you really ?
i &apos;m on a better path .
it &apos;s a journey .
thank you for asking , manny .
and thank you for your letters .
it &apos;s a lost art .
no one puts pen to paper anymore .
haley dunphy ?
yes , that &apos;s me .
i &apos;m dean miller with admissions .
this is professor williams .
hi .
and this is our student representative ,
aidan feldman .
nice to meet you .
seriously ?
we sit next to each other in econ .
oh , right .
don &apos;t .
it insults both of us .
mostly me .
move it along , aidan .
this is a disciplinary hearing , not jdate .
you are charged with public drunkenness ,
resisting arrest , and assaulting a police officer ,
all of which obviously violate our school &apos;s code of conduct .
sir , if i may speak on behalf of my client ...
who are you ?
i &apos;m mitchell pritchett ,
i &apos;m miss dunphy &apos;s attorney .
we require students to speak for themselves .
there are no attorneys allowed . you shouldn &apos;t even be here .
what if i just sat in this chair and i was really super quiet
and i just listen ?
i &apos;ll allow it .
knock it off , aidan .
miss dunphy , is there anything
you would like to say in your defense ?
actually , i have no defense .
i was drinking . i am underage .
i ran from the police .
and even though it was an accident , i injured an officer .
i am very , very sorry .
i &apos;ve made a lot of bad decisions since i &apos;ve been here ,
and it &apos;s time i take some responsibility .
like sometimes in the dining hall ,
i slip my pinky under the scale when they weigh my salad .
also , i &apos;ve missed more morning classes than i &apos;ve been to .
i don &apos;t know what the policy is on dating t.a.s ,
but i think i broke it .
twice .
oh , man .
oh , and if we &apos;re gonna be completely honest ,
on my application to get in here ,
i lied about the fact that i was--
uh , objection !
on what grounds ?
oh , he gets to say it ? ! he gets to--
miss dunphy , miss dunphy ,
we appreciate your ... candor .
is there anything else you &apos;d like to add ?
go , wildcats ?
oh , boy .
that &apos;s not even our mascot .
what does this do ?
i don &apos;t know , but thanks obama , you &apos;re paying for it .
hey . you &apos;re looking a lot better . how you feeling ?
better than kidney stones over there .
yeah , you know what ? now that you &apos;re doing better ,
i think i should call your mom and tell her what happened .
you know , i know it was a bit of a rough ride in the beginning ,
but the important thing is , is i handled it .
and everybody &apos;s okay .
what happened to her ?
hello ?
she passed out watching a c @-@ section .
cam ?
never mind !
what are you looking for ?
nothing ! i am making a lot of noise because i &apos;m angry !
gloria , i &apos;m gonna help you with the baby .
i am not young like with manny .
i am tired already ,
and it &apos;s gonna get harder from here !
i can &apos;t do this on my own ,
and you did this to me ,
so you &apos;re going to be here this time !
back then , we were living paycheck to paycheck .
the reason i wasn &apos;t around is i was working all the time .
believe me , dede wasn &apos;t the only one having sleepless nights .
but now it &apos;s different .
now i can help you with everything .
really ?
let &apos;s start right now .
i like that one .
which one ?
that silver stroller .
no , we &apos;re going to get the green one .
great . what &apos;s next ?
how about i pick out the wrong crib ?
how you doing , alex ?
i &apos;m fine , except for the crushing blow
of knowing i &apos;ll never be a doctor .
or have a baby .
i wonder what &apos;s going on with haley .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve been so petty about your mom judging my parenting ,
i haven &apos;t even thought about what she &apos;s going through today .
i feel awful . you know what ? i should call her .
what are you talking about ? mom thinks you &apos;re a great parent .
she does ?
yeah , she just thinks you can &apos;t bake .
hello ?
never mind .
making a child is the easy part .
the hard part is everything that comes after .
keeping them safe ...
well , you can tell your mother that my scones
are appropriately crunchy on the outside
while delightfully dense on the ins--
saw that . saw it .
making sacrifices for them ...
hey , kid .
i &apos;ll take you to that poetry reading thing tonight .
actually , dede and i were just talking .
she &apos;s a huge fan of spoken word ...
and i would love to escort him .
please .
go .
and standing by them , even when they let you down .
i really am sorry .
we appreciate that .
it &apos;s good that you stepped up today .
yeah . sometimes it &apos;s healthy to get a fresh start .
i can &apos;t believe this . what am i gonna do ?
well , they said you could reapply next year .
in the meantime , you &apos;re gonna get a job
and you &apos;re gonna take some classes .
well , i &apos;m gonna buckle down and get a lot more serious .
good for you .
yeah .
where are my keys ?
oh , they &apos;re right there on the makeup table .
oh , honey ...
that &apos;s a desk .
oh , my god . what are you doing here ?
i got kicked out .
so go ahead , make your jokes . get it out of your system .
no , that &apos;s horrible . i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;ll be fine . i &apos;m sure of it .
thank you .
ew , what did you do to my room ? !
well , it &apos;s not exactly your room . it &apos;s--it &apos;s mine .
this goes . this goes . i hate that .
this is ugly .
haley , stop !
mom !
mom !
what is this ? a solar system ?
it &apos;s molecules .
they &apos;re nerdy balls .
alex , don &apos;t fight with her .
she might have a shiv .
we cool ?
