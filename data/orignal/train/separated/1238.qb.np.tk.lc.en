oh , my god , ali &apos;s with charles .
cece ?
they never understood how much i loved you .
you were like , my very own living doll .
cece is charles ?
does she think we came between her and ali ?
is that what this has all been about ?
sara ?
cece , please don &apos;t do this .
damn it .
don &apos;t do this !
you &apos;ve spent your whole life
trying to get back to your family .
no !
game over .
i heard that sara got released from the hospital today .
what happened to sara that night wasn &apos;t our fault .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re actually leaving .
how lucky am i to have something
that makes saying goodbye so hard .
what brilliant scholar said that ?
winnie the pooh .
don &apos;t look at me , i &apos;m ready to hang a sign , &quot; bitch can see . &quot;
this is about betrayal ?
it &apos;s not about betrayal , spencer .
it &apos;s about revenge .
he knows we &apos;re lying .
so stop pining for the fjords and carpe hottie !
i know it &apos;s over .
i know that .
and yes .
i know the dead girl who isn &apos;t dead anymore .
&quot; when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
&quot; i summon up remembrance of things past ,
&quot; i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought ,
&quot; and with old woes new wail my dear time &apos;s waste :
&quot; then can i drown an eye , unused to flow ,
&quot; for precious friends hid in death &apos;s dateless night ,
&quot; and weep afresh love &apos;s long since canceled woe ,
&quot; and moan the expense of many a vanished sight .. &quot;
i &apos;m sorry . uh , i got a little lost .
tomorrow , you get to read to me .
dr. rollins , did we have an appointment ?
i thought i &apos;d let you know in person .
the judge set a date for the hearing ?
yes .
thank you .
don &apos;t thank me yet .
it &apos;s happening in four days .
four days ?
it was four days , or six months .
alison ?
i want to enclose something in the court notifications .
i can take care of that .
thank you .
alison , i have to remind you
the court can compel your friends to come
but they may not be sympathetic to the cause .
you don &apos;t know them the way i do .
&quot; there isn &apos;t much time , but i wanted you to see
&quot; these words on paper and not a screen .
&quot; i wanted to know you were touching
something i touched , that we were connected . &quot;
all set ?
以斯拉 · 费兹
&quot; we &apos;ve been through things no other friends have experienced .
&quot; we understand each other better than
&quot; anyone else in the world . &quot;
hi .
thanks for watching her .
we had a nice long talk .
&quot; but all that connects us to someone else .
&quot; someone i love . someone who needs me .
&quot; i know you &apos;re coming back to rosewood
&quot; to speak to the court about charlotte being released .
&quot; i &apos;m asking for five minutes with you .
&quot; five minutes to explain .
&quot; five minutes that can change the whole world . &quot;
do you think they &apos;ll come ?
of course they &apos;ll come .
it &apos;s been a long time .
do you think they &apos;re still upset with me ?
i will bring you home , charlotte .
i promise .
spencer , aria , hanna , emily .
i need you . please .
all my love , alison .
guess who ?
oh , my gosh .
ah ! god , i missed you .
i missed you too .
oh , get a room . ew !
we &apos;ll need a pretty big room . hi !
any hints about the fall collection ?
my non @-@ disclosure agreement is eight pages long .
claudia would literally chase me down the runway
with an axe if i let anything slip .
let me see this .
it looked bigger when you posted it .
so i suppose we &apos;re gonna need our passports
to attend the wedding .
well , we &apos;re talking to several host nations .
but italy is a strong contender .
i met a nice italian girl one time .
no wonder it took you a year longer to finish college .
how &apos;s the salk institute ?
uh , good . i &apos;m still trying to find my way around .
all that great louis kahn architecture .
i want a tour .
they &apos;re not doing tours right now , but ..
how &apos;s liam ?
liam is adorable .
but he hates when i tell people that .
who is spencer seeing ?
spencer is too busy to see anybody .
wait , what about the ambassador &apos;s son ?
regime change .
so this court thing , are we going to be under oath ?
no oath , it &apos;s just about how we feel
about charlotte getting out .
no , tell the truth .
it is about &quot; a &quot; getting out .
five &quot; a &quot; -free years .
you have to admit , that felt good .
i mean , a lot has happened , good , bad and ugly ,
but all of it was uncontaminated by &quot; a. &quot;
and now &quot; a &quot; wants to go home .
what are we gonna do ?
we drop off our bags and we go meet ali at 4 o &apos;clock
and listen to what she has to say .
so how long can you stay ?
i don &apos;t know . the hearing &apos;s tomorrow .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here , but
i wish you didn &apos;t have to do this .
how about we focus on the that fact i &apos;m here ?
right .
how &apos;s greg ?
we &apos;re taking a little break .
why ?
em , it was just time for a break .
i thought you liked him .
let &apos;s talk about that over tea , okay ?
wow , this is really amazing .
thank you .
seriously , you would never know that
this used to be a nut house .
okay , we prefer the european definition
of &quot; sanitarium , &quot; when talking about this historic structure .
well , it looks beautiful . you did a really good job .
thanks .
didn &apos;t it sort of creep you out though ?
we evicted all the ghosts , hanna .
soon people will forget what this place was
and we &apos;ll just be remembered only for our exquisite brunch .
my mother , the exorcist .
i was hoping you &apos;d bring jordan with you .
yeah , uh , next time .
i &apos;ve been trying to get you back here
to see the place since we opened .
i know , but i &apos;ve been busy .
paris took forever .
but when alison calls ..
it isn &apos;t alison , mom . it &apos;s the court .
it &apos;s still alison .
she &apos;s been petitioning the court to get charlotte
out of the hospital since the day she was locked up .
you don &apos;t owe alison a thing .
after what that person did to you--
mom , i know what she did to me .
and i know exactly what i &apos;m gonna say to the judge .
liam wanted you to have this .
the james tiptree short stories you were talking about .
is he trying to impress me ?
yes .
well , he &apos;s off to a very good start .
he wants to know when you &apos;re coming back to boston .
not until the semester &apos;s over .
how long are you staying ?
i just have to see how it goes .
so what did you think of the new radley ?
haven &apos;t seen it yet , but i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll get down there .
i thought that &apos;s where you were
meeting hanna and the other girls .
no , we met at the brew . old habits .
the brew ?
yeah , that &apos;s right . why ?
did you see ezra there ?
he &apos;s back .
he still owns the place , and i heard that
he &apos;s moved into the apartment upstairs .
i thought he was still in south america .
no , apparently , he got sick and they sent him home .
i haven &apos;t talked to him , but i &apos;ve seen him in town .
did you know the girl ?
nicole ?
i met her once .
a long time ago . before they left .
fifteen dead or missing .
they were down there building houses .
that &apos;s not supposed to be controversial .
have you talked to him ?
no , i wrote him a letter when nicole ...
when it happened , but i never heard back from him .
hastings for state senate . the clear , true voice .
i &apos;m veronica hastings
and i approve this message .
the flag &apos;s a really nice touch .
i never would have thought of it .
don &apos;t be cynical , spencer .
where &apos;s dad ?
in harrisburg , raising money .
the family that campaigns together , stays together .
your father is a champion arm twister
and we need the cash .
it &apos;s an off @-@ year special election ,
winning might come down to if it rains that day
and people decide to stay home .
oh , now who &apos;s being cynical ?
it &apos;s your fault i &apos;m doing this .
you got involved in government first . you inspired me .
i watch the government , i keep it honest . that &apos;s what i do .
sweetheart , you work for a lobbyist .
no , we are not lobbyists .
we work with grassroots political organizations
to advance progressive legislation .
you &apos;re a lobbyist ..
and your mother is going to be a state senator .
i &apos;m so proud of you .
your bosses are very angry with me .
they &apos;re not angry .
they gave me an advance on the second book .
they know what happened in south america .
they understand .
well , then they &apos;re ahead of me
because i don &apos;t understand any of it .
i don &apos;t understand how a girl that i met in this shop
who never hurt anybody , can be dragged off
by half @-@ baked revolutionaries ,
and no one can seem to find her .
so , if you understand that , explain it to me .
you go somewhere to help , it shouldn &apos;t cost you your life .
i &apos;m sorry . sorry .
when did you get here ?
uh , just a couple of hours ago .
this is really impressive .
i , i , uh , i just wanted to see if i could do it .
how &apos;s it going ?
ah , it &apos;s harder than i thought .
i curse a lot . it &apos;s very therapeutic .
how &apos;s washington ?
um , i curse a lot . it &apos;s very therapeutic .
uh , caleb said he saw you there .
oh , yeah ? you guys talk ?
uh , now and then .
we went , uh , we went fishing last summer .
seriously ?
yeah .
we &apos;re the brotherhood of ex @-@ boyfriends .
we gotta stick together .
so , you in town for your mom &apos;s campaign ?
no , uh , i got a request from the state of pennsylvania .
they would like my opinion on something .
ali &apos;s trying to get charlotte out of the hospital .
yeah . we &apos;re here to talk to the court .
we ?
aria , em , hanna , and me .
all of you in one place at one time .
when &apos;s the last time that happened in rosewood ?
long time .
when alison flashes the bat signal--
it &apos;s not like that , you know , we &apos;re still friends
and we &apos;re not just , &quot; let &apos;s go see a movie and have dinner &quot;
kinda friends , but the &quot; i saved your life , now you save mine &quot;
kinda friends .
you know . you were there .
how long are you gonna be here for ?
well , the hearing &apos;s tomorrow .
and then , and then i don &apos;t really know .
can i ... buy you a dinner before you leave ?
yeah . sure , we can do that .
um , i , i should go though . i &apos;m supposed to be meeting ali .
and i &apos;m already late . so , i &apos;ll call you , okay .
still the same number ?
same number .
cool .
toby ,
who are you building the house for ?
what makes you think i &apos;m building it for somebody ?
because i know you .
charlotte is getting the help
she never had when she was little .
five years of treatment , undoing all the damage .
i visit her , i spend time with her .
she even stayed at my house for a weekend last christmas .
they let her out ?
it was a supervised visit .
so charlotte is all better now .
what does this have to do with us ?
at the hearing tomorrow , the judge will decide
if she should be released .
and they want to hear from people who were involved .
victim statements .
statements of support .
statements that she isn &apos;t a threat to anybody .
that you guys are not afraid of her anymore .
there is no reason to be afraid .
you know her .
you heard her story . we all went through this together .
yes , we did .
we have the scars to prove it too .
you &apos;re asking us to give a get @-@ out @-@ of @-@ jail @-@ free card
to someone who tried to kill us .
she &apos;s in a hospital , hanna . she &apos;s not in jail .
she &apos;s lucky .
and we &apos;re lucky to be alive .
that &apos;s why your statements would mean so much .
who else is speaking ?
mona demanded to be heard .
she &apos;s going to talk to the judge about
the dollhouse , and being tortured .
what about sara harvey ?
what about her ?
well , suppose we do talk to the judge ..
they march in sara harvey .
she gives a few choice words about
what happened to her that night at radley ?
she &apos;s not allowed to testify because of how
her criminal charges were resolved .
why isn &apos;t jason here ?
he doesn &apos;t agree with dr. rollins and me .
okay , you realize what you &apos;re asking us to do .
you want us to forgive charlotte .
i don &apos;t care if you forgive her .
i &apos;m asking you to give me my only chance at a real family .
alison , we &apos;re here to say how we feel
and you &apos;re asking us to lie .
please , do this .
do this for me .
pretty please ?
with sugar on top ?
what ?
that &apos;s what you say on a playground to exact a favor .
we &apos;re not on the playground anymore , alison .
we haven &apos;t been for a long time .
please ?
i am not one of those candidates who runs for office
telling you how much i hate the government
and wanna take it apart .
like you , i understand that the size of the problem
dictates the size of the solution needed .
if being honest and truthful is so damn purifying ..
why do i feel like the bottom of somebody &apos;s shoe ?
government is big enough to do .
our courts are not the enemy of freedom .
look , they have the reports .
okay , they know what charlotte did to us when she was &quot; a. &quot;
we don &apos;t need to talk about that .
all we &apos;ve to say is that we &apos;re not afraid of her .
that &apos;s all ali wants .
then we get the hell out of here .
is it the truth ? that we &apos;re not afraid ?
maybe it is . i mean , look at us .
we did get away . we won .
maybe we didn &apos;t kill the dragon , but we definitely tamed it .
um , i &apos;ll be right back .
no one feels safe where anyone can be victimized .
your mom &apos;s doing well in the polls
for such an untested candidate .
hi , mona .
i waved at you at the kennedy center reception .
you didn &apos;t see me .
i &apos;m sorry .
look at us , all this time
and we both end up in the same business .
um , not really .
we both sell policy .
different kinds of policy .
do you still have nightmares ?
i do .
three shrinks and a whole lot of prescriptions
but i still have bad dreams .
how about you ?
now , i &apos;d like to introduce one of the reasons
why i &apos;m running for office .
my daughter , spencer hastings .
don &apos;t miss your cue .
spencer and i just ... went out of sync .
it happens .
i @-@ i @-@ i like this town , but everywhere she went
it was like she saw something that she wanted to forget .
i wouldn &apos;t have pictured you and ali to be the ones to stay .
different reasons , same results .
you got your degree , didn &apos;t you ?
took a while , mostly nights , but i got it .
didn &apos;t do much good this year .
got passed over for promotion .
college wasn &apos;t what i thought it was gonna be .
i look at aria , spencer , and even hanna
it all seemed to click for them .
not for you ?
no .
i had a hard time .
when my dad died , i just couldn &apos;t see a point to it .
to the college ?
to anything .
my family has always had a missing part .
what &apos;s missing is my sister charlotte .
past five years i &apos;ve gotten to know
come to love this missing part of my family .
and now , i wanna bring my sister home .
i &apos;m sure that you &apos;ve read all of the documents
about who charlotte is , and what she &apos;s done to us .
those are just reports .
one thing that i &apos;ve learned from all of this is that
people are not always the things that they do .
charlotte dilaurentis poses no threat to me .
i was angry for a long time .
but now , every morning i wake up ..
i drink coffee , and i walk outside .
it &apos;s either sunny or it &apos;s raining , but there i am .
i &apos;m free .
i don &apos;t see why charlotte shouldn &apos;t have the same chance
to get caught in the rain as i do .
no , i &apos;m not afraid of her .
my dad taught me that fear is natural .
it &apos;s a good instinct .
he also said that you can decide
what you &apos;re going to be afraid of .
i decided i &apos;m not afraid of charlotte dilaurentis .
alison and dr. rollins have told us
how well charlotte &apos;s been doing .
how rapidly she &apos;s been able to integrate herself
into the general hospital population .
they feel strongly that--
i &apos;m sorry .
miss montgomery .
sorry .
they feel strongly ..
that now is the right time for charlotte--
miss montgomery , i &apos;ve read the same reports that you have .
well , the doctors--
the doctors can speak for themselves .
you &apos;re here to tell me if you &apos;d feel safe
should charlotte dilaurentis leave the hospital .
miss montgomery ?
no .
no , i would not feel safe .
i was on the redline
going to braintree ..
and the train stopped in the tunnel
between the stations .
the power went out and , and it was dark .
no , not dark . it was black .
and i was back in every box
in every dark tight place that
&quot; a &quot; ever put me in , and i couldn &apos;t breathe .
then i heard a girl crying .
good . i thought somebody else is scared out of her mind .
then ... the power came back on
and every single person on that train
was staring at me .
because i was the girl that was crying .
i don &apos;t want charlotte released .
ever .
here comes the last nail in the coffin .
i thought i could do this , but i can &apos;t .
i &apos;ve been listening to my friends
how they &apos;ve managed to forgive charlotte .
i wish i could hate her , but i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t , because i know what she went through .
i was in radley sanitarium .
i was there for months .
charlotte was there for years , and years .
being in that place is what twisted her all out of shape .
let her out .
let her go home .
that &apos;s all any of us want .
is to have a home .
i &apos;m sorry .
are you okay with this ?
it &apos;s a little bit strange .
we can go somewhere else , when they get here .
no , if you &apos;re gonna chase away the demons
you have to go to where the demons are .
you know who i thought was gonna walk into that hearing room ?
who ?
sara harvey .
they said that she wouldn &apos;t be there .
or what if she did show up ?
we tell our little white lies , and in she walks .
&quot; these bitches are lying , your honor . &quot;
&quot; wanna know what they &apos;re really like ? &quot;
&quot; let me show you what they did to me . &quot;
and she shows everybody .
艾莉
so , that &apos;s that .
&quot; the judge says charlotte can go home . &quot;
&quot; thanks for your help , ali . &quot;
did you guys see ?
we saw .
everyone , say hello to the only honest woman in town .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , we &apos;re sorry .
you &apos;re small , but you are mighty .
you put us all to shame .
alright , everyone turn your phones off .
not silent , not vibrate , off .
i can &apos;t turn my phone all the way off .
spencer , one of the lifesaving pieces of information
i &apos;ve learned , is that these things
actually have an off button .
do it , spencer .
okay !
the coven of the sacred cocktails is now in session .
you know , if you didn &apos;t know what this place was
you &apos;d never know what this place was .
said the real estate agent showing you
around &quot; the house on haunted hill . &quot;
i miss your faces .
you guys have such excellent faces .
thank you .
or we should plan on seeing each other more often .
yes , but not here .
ugh , we can make a list of beautiful cities
and go to each one of them .
and that can get expensive .
paris , rome
madrid , rio .
we can party in every one of them .
and ali and charlotte can sit in that big , ugly house
and they can bake cookies .
you &apos;d think a place like this , they &apos;d have ... special drinks .
what kind of special drinks ?
we &apos;re sitting in a bar , in what used to be a squirrel factory .
but no , like , an electroshock margarita ?
manic depressive mai tai ?
you guys are seriously lacking in any good taste .
that &apos;s why i love you so much .
i love each one of you .
spencer loves us .
so i heard .
hey , uh , can we get another bipolar martini
for my friend over here ?
last call in rosewood .
can we just go someplace and dance ?
that &apos;s why god invented the mini @-@ bar , em .
we can go back to my suite .
&apos;tis but the crank of the evening .
hey , don &apos;t .
my mom runs this joint .
you guys wanna hear something funny ?
i &apos;d love to hear something funny .
i thought it wouldn &apos;t matter what we said to the judge ..
because i thought they would never let her out .
i thought that we could just lie for ali
one more time and it wouldn &apos;t matter .
but it did .
they let &quot; a &quot; out .
wouldn &apos;t it just be the biggest cosmic joke ever
if charlotte gets to live happily ever after ?
if she can do it , so can we .
a toast to charlotte .
to charlotte .
to charlotte .
why can &apos;t they make quiet ice cubes ?
here , hydrate .
thanks .
are you going to see toby ?
i already did .
he &apos;s building a house .
he &apos;s building a house ?
with tools ?
by himself ?
yup .
yeah . wow , indeed .
all i got was a chair , and some lucky girl
is gonna get an entire house .
sit . stay .
she &apos;s not a poodle .
hello .
hanna , it &apos;s me .
hi , ali .
did charlotte come to your hotel room last night ?
mm , no she didn &apos;t , what &apos;s wrong ?
i don &apos;t know where she is .
you don &apos;t know where charlotte is ?
dr. rollins brought her home last night .
we talked for hours , she was so happy and grateful .
we went to bed , and this morning she was gone .
all of her stuff is here but she isn &apos;t .
dr. rollins wants me to call the police .
yeah , you should .
can you call the others and come over ?
yeah , i will , but , ali , don &apos;t wait .
call the police .
please hurry .
charlotte was there when they went to sleep
and now she &apos;s gone .
the sexton found her .
he got here for morning service , he saw the door had been forced .
checked the building , went to the bell tower
and saw the open shutter and looked down .
do we know what time this happened ?
sprinklers are on a timer , grass under the body is wet
but her clothes are dry .
puts it between 3 a.m. and first light .
are you sure about the identification ?
hospital id card , and i saw her face .
it &apos;s charlotte dilaurentis .
stay with her until she falls asleep .
i will .
are you alright ?
if i thought there was any chance
of charlotte taking her own life , i ..
i @-@ i never would &apos;ve let her leave the hospital .
sorry , um , i thought that you were room service .
i &apos;m afraid not .
spencer called me .
she told me what happened .
spencer called you ?
yeah , i saw her in washington .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m actually thinking about working for her outfit .
i was with her when she got the letter .
can i come in ?
yeah .
thanks .
why are you here ?
sorry , um ..
it &apos;s been a very wrong day
and i didn &apos;t expect you to show up on my doorstep
or anywhere else .
yeah , uh , spencer told me about charlotte
and , um ... i don &apos;t know .
maybe it was a conditioned reflex
but ... i thought i could help .
well , i &apos;m glad to know that your reflexes still work .
you okay ?
well , we came here to help ali
and charlotte killed herself .
we could &apos;ve just kept our mouths shut
and she would still be
in a nice , safe hospital .
instead , we have another funeral to get through .
yeah .
i thought i might stick around for that .
well , my mom can set you up with a room here , if you want .
uh , no , that &apos;s okay , actually , um
i &apos;m staying in spencer &apos;s barn .
so how &apos;ve you been ?
i &apos;ve been okay .
are you still in new york ?
yeah , i travel a lot more for the collection .
still a roadie for a bunch of dresses .
that &apos;s me .
yeah .
well , if you need anything
you know where to find me .
right .
why didn &apos;t you call me before you came over ?
i wasn &apos;t sure that you would let me in .
why wouldn &apos;t i let you in ?
we &apos;re still friends , aren &apos;t we ?
yeah .
of course we are .
then i &apos;ll talk to you later .
how was it ?
complicated .
yeah .
that &apos;s why i wanted to stay down here .
thanks for calling me .
i appreciate it .
i &apos;m really glad that you &apos;re here .
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s kinda strange
what they did to this place , huh ?
yeah , i think it &apos;s like cultural amnesia .
yeah , well , people get do @-@ overs
why shouldn &apos;t buildings ?
this isn &apos;t happening .
i &apos;m gonna bring the car .
okay .
what is she doing here ?
making sure that charlotte &apos;s really dead .
really , most sincerely dead .
let &apos;s go .
hello .
lorenzo .
how are you ?
alright .
under the circumstances .
i was wondering what your plans are
for the next couple of days .
if you &apos;re gonna stay in rosewood .
why ?
it &apos;d make it easier if you stayed .
make what easier ?
we have the autopsy report on charlotte dilaurentis .
charlotte was dead when she was thrown from the bell tower .
thrown ?
she was murdered ?
the death &apos;s been ruled a homicide , yeah .
you &apos;ll get a call .
was someone waiting for charlotte
to get released so they can kill her ?
don &apos;t go there .
spencer , we &apos;ve lived there for a long time .
it &apos;s not like it &apos;s a long commute .
i wanna go home .
