oh , hey , you guys ?
i couldn &apos;t get a reservation for the night of my birthday ..
so we &apos;ll have to do dinner thursday night .
thursday ? but that &apos;s halloween .
so ?
it &apos;s just spooky , that &apos;s all .
so , is mike coming to dinner ?
no . it &apos;s my first birthday with a boyfriend , and he has to work .
i &apos;d get mad at him , but i think it &apos;s too soon to show my true colors .
i would make the reservation for five . one of us has to stay with emma .
which one of us should go to dinner ?
rachel !
actually , i was thinking maybe both of us could go .
oh , yeah
thanks . i &apos;ll put a lot of extra thought into your gift .
all right , so great , we can all go now .
that is fun ! hey ! you know what ?
we all haven &apos;t been together , the six of us , in such a long time .
what are you talking about ? we &apos;re together now .
mon ? chandler &apos;s not here .
oh , dear god .
the.one.with.phoebes.birthday.dinner
hello . it &apos;s nice to see our team together for the first time .
now , before we get started , are there any questions ?
yes . ken , is it ?
that &apos;s right .
is it true the reason you &apos;re in tulsa is , you fell asleep in a meeting ..
and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to ?
well , don &apos;t believe everything you hear , ken .
but yeah , that &apos;s true .
all right , let &apos;s get started by taking a look at last quarter &apos;s figures .
claudia , aren &apos;t you supposed to blow smoke up the boss &apos;s ass ?
i &apos;m sorry . does the smoke bother you ?
no . i smoked for years . then i quit .
right now , i can &apos;t remember why .
you &apos;re not allowed to smoke in this office , right ?
yes , in oklahoma
it &apos;s legal to smoke in offices with 15 people or less .
would you like one ?
would joey like two pizzas ?
you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m talking about .
all right , look . i don &apos;t smoke anymore .
but if the rest of you want to light up , go ahead , it &apos;s fine .
so , you all smoke , then ?
you know , it &apos;s almost rude that i &apos;m not smoking .
that &apos;s not true . if you don &apos;t want ..
ken , please !
no , i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t smoke . if i smoke , my wife would kill me .
i &apos;m sorry , but isn &apos;t your wife back in new york ?
i &apos;ve always liked you , ken .
trick or treat .
hey .
and &quot; treat &quot; it is .
wow . so glad i changed .
i almost wore my threadbare robe that can &apos;t contain my breasts .
this is not what i &apos;m wearing . i &apos;m ovulating ..
and chandler &apos;s gonna be home . so , i thought we would try before dinner .
oh , i thought we &apos;d all go over together .
all right , i &apos;ll just meet you there at dinner .
unless , i mean , if it helps , i could stay and watch .
no !
well , i didn &apos;t want to anyway .
you know , just thought i &apos;d be polite and offer .
wait , does this mean you &apos;ll be late ?
we haven &apos;t seen each other in over a week .
we &apos;ll probably be the first ones there .
okay . see you there . happy humping .
hey . well , hey !
wow , somebody smoked out here ?
my god , don &apos;t people know you &apos;re not allowed to smoke in public spaces ?
actually , in oklahoma smoking &apos;s legal in offices with fewer than 15 people .
oh , you smoked .
no . i just happen to know a lot of trivia about smoking in different states .
for example , in hawaii , cigarettes are called lei @-@ lana @-@ lukus .
oh , chandler , you stink of cigarettes !
do you think monica will smell it ?
are you kidding ? that woman has the nose of a bloodhound .
and the breasts of a greek goddess .
phoebe ?
i &apos;m gonna go .
okay . something to cover the smell .
oven cleaner .
unscented .
welcome home .
i &apos;ve missed you .
you want to join me in the bedroom ?
no , thanks , i &apos;m good .
okay . so you want to play it that way , do you ?
well , you know what , actually , i just got off a plane ..
so i &apos;m feeling gross . i should take a shower .
come here , you don &apos;t need a shower .
all right , the truth is ..
i soiled myself during some turbulence .
what do i smell ? i smell smoke .
did you smoke ?
yes . but i just had one .
two .
two tiny cigarettes . okay , five .
a pack . two pack .. a carton .
three big fat cartons in two days !
but it &apos;s over . i &apos;ve made a decision , i &apos;m not gonna smoke anymore .
well , those are for you .
all right . well , we &apos;ll just see you when you get here . bye .
oh , that was my mom . she &apos;s stuck in terrible traffic .
that is now the third sign that i should not leave emma .
what are the other two ?
well , the first one is , i don &apos;t want to .
and second one , i &apos;m not going .
i know this is the first time we &apos;re leaving the baby .
i know how hard it is for you . but ..
but everything &apos;s gonna be fine . i mean , my mom is gonna be with her .
she &apos;s great with kids .
she is ?
yeah .
what about monica ?
you only hear monica &apos;s side of that . okay , that little fatso was a terror !
i just don &apos;t think i can do it .
know what ? you can and you should .
really , it will be good for you .
in fact , you know what ?
go ahead to the restaurant , and i will wait for my mom ..
and then i &apos;ll meet you there . no , no , really , you should go . go out .
really , the world is your oyster . kick up your heels . paint the town red !
you need to learn some new slang .
i &apos;m serious . come on , you should go .
here . no , just go .
well ..
no , no ! you know what ?
you &apos;re not getting back in there ! the baby &apos;s fine . now , scram !
yeah , hit the bricks !
tell your story walking !
i was just going to say that i left my keys .
holy moley , are we in a pickle now !
where is everyone ? they &apos;re 40 minutes late .
i know .
i &apos;m starving .
i knew we were coming here tonight . i ate nothing all day .
what about me ? i only had one lunch today .
so , are we expecting the rest of our party shortly ?
yes , they are expected presently . yeah .
their arrival is in the offing .
right . we have a table for two available .
perhaps you &apos;d ..
no , they &apos;re coming .
we &apos;re waiting right here .
joseph !
one needn &apos;t worry . they shan &apos;t be long .
it &apos;s just that we do have some large parties waiting .
oh , one really does have a stick up one &apos;s ass , doesn &apos;t one ?
why would you start smoking again ? it &apos;s so bad for you .
it &apos;s only been two days . that &apos;s not enough time to ..
that &apos;s totally unrelated .
how can you smoke in this day and age ? have you not seen that ad ?
where the little kid walks through grandpa ? it &apos;s chilling !
i messed up . it was a meeting . everybody was smoking .
so what ? don &apos;t you have any willpower ?
willpower ? i &apos;ve watched home movies of you eating ding dongs ..
without taking the tinfoil off !
you said that was sexy !
okay , look , can we just drop this ? i &apos;m not gonna smoke again .
that &apos;s right , because i forbid you to smoke again .
you forbid me ?
i &apos;ve flown a long way to see my loving wife .
is she here , by the way ?
chandler , don &apos;t joke with me . okay ? i &apos;m very , very upset right now .
is this the most upset you could be ?
i think so .
well , then i might as well ..
do this .
not really sure what to do now .
i &apos;ll tell you what we &apos;re gonna do .
we &apos;re already late for phoebe &apos;s birthday dinner .
so you &apos;re going to put out that cigarette ..
we &apos;re gonna put this fight on hold , and go have sex .
fine . what ?
what , do you have cigarettes in your ears ?
sex ! this is the last day i &apos;m ovulating . if we don &apos;t do it ..
we &apos;re gonna have to wait until next month !
you &apos;re serious ?
oh , yeah !
all right , fine , i &apos;ll do it , but no talking !
and no cuddling .
and no kissing your neck .
oh , good ! i hate it when you do that !
and lots of kissing your neck !
okay , well , the super &apos;s not home .
but my mother &apos;s gonna be here , and she has the key .
i can &apos;t wait that long . you have to do something . knock that door down !
i would , but i bruise like a peach .
besides , you know , everything &apos;s gonna be fine . the baby &apos;s sleeping .
what if she jumps out of the bassinet ?
can &apos;t hold her head up , but jumped .
oh , my god ! i left the water running !
you did not leave the water running . please , pull yourself together , okay ?
well , did i leave the stove on ?
you haven &apos;t cooked since 1996 .
is the window open ? if the window &apos;s open a bird could fly in and ..
my god , you know what ? i think you &apos;re right .
listen .
what ? what ?
a pigeon . no . no , wait , no . an eagle flew in !
landed on the stove and caught fire !
the baby , seeing this , jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird &apos;s aid .
the eagle , however , misconstrues this as an act of aggression ..
and grabs the baby in its talon .
meanwhile , the faucet fills the apartment with water .
baby and bird , still ablaze , are locked in a death grip ..
swirling around the whirlpool that fills the apartment !
boy , are you gonna be sorry if that &apos;s true .
hello .
hi .
it &apos;s been an hour .
the maitre d &apos; asked if you &apos;d reconsider switching to a smaller table .
maybe we should just eat now .
you can &apos;t order until the entire party &apos;s arrived . restaurant policy .
well , how about this ? another table leaves , right ..
but there &apos;s still some food left on their plates .
okay , what &apos;s the restaurant &apos;s policy about people eating that ?
it &apos;s frowned upon .
but it happens .
all right , i got to go to the bathroom .
you can &apos;t go .
no , no , no . i can &apos;t hold this table on my own .
if they ask me to move , i &apos;ll cave .
well , if you ask me to stay , i &apos;ll pee .
good evening , miss .
miss ?
miss ? miss ?
okay , fine , i &apos;ll move . all right . you don &apos;t have to manhandle me .
where ?
okay .
thank you . wow .
will you stop staring at us now ?
that depends . will your friend stop drinking olive oil directly from the bottle ?
probably not .
finally . you guys made it .
phoebe , who the hell .. ?
what is taking you so long , come on , let &apos;s get it over with !
in a minute , sweet cakes .
spend more time with the tie ! that will make a baby .
look , i can &apos;t do this . i can &apos;t make love to you while we &apos;re fighting this way .
oh , sure . now you &apos;re mr. sensitivity .
but when you wanted to have sex after my uncle &apos;s funeral ..
that was a celebration of life !
all right , i &apos;m not gonna do this .
is this the way you want our baby to be conceived ?
no , you &apos;re right .
we shouldn &apos;t do it like this .
for what it &apos;s worth , i &apos;m sorry .
i shouldn &apos;t have come down on you so hard about the smoking .
so you had a few cigarettes . it &apos;s not the end of the world .
really ?
yeah .
you are incredible .
and listen , i &apos;m not gonna smoke again .
and if i do , i promise i will hide it so much better from you .
want to ?
let &apos;s celebrate life !
okay !
oh , god .
oh , thank god you &apos;re okay .
i &apos;m sorry we left . mommy will never leave you again .
never , ever , ever again .
great . so let &apos;s get going .
i mean it . after what just happened , i &apos;m never leaving her again .
i understand . separation is hard .
one time i was about to leave ross to go to the beauty parlor .
and he got so upset he took off all his clothes ..
tucked his willy between his legs ..
and cried out , &quot; mommy , i &apos;m a girl . take me with you . &quot;
somehow , over time , it got easier to be apart from you .
you are welcome .
you know what ? let &apos;s not talk .
what ?
i am still so mad at you for smoking !
but you said you forgave me .
it was just a couple of cigarettes , no big deal .
i was ovulating and you said you wouldn &apos;t have sex if we were fighting .
you tricked me to get me into bed ?
that &apos;s right . i got mine .
i feel so used .
well , i guess they &apos;re not coming . you want to just order ?
thank you .
waiter ? all right , this is gonna go fast , so try to keep up .
risotto with shaved truffles and the rib steak ..
with the golden chanterelles and the bordelaise sauce ..
unless any of that stuff i just said means &quot; snails . &quot;
it does not .
tomato tart , and which of the pastas would you recommend ?
oh , well they &apos;re both exquisite ..
both it is . thank you .
now , let &apos;s go , baby . it &apos;s food time . bring it , bitch .
sorry about that .
it &apos;s quite all right .
oh , can i make a special request ?
can you bring everything as it &apos;s ready ?
appetizers , entrees , we don &apos;t care .
hey !
i &apos;ll wait to put your order in .
what did i ever do to you ?
nothing , bitch .
you guys are over an hour late .
what happened to you two ?
so sorry .
we got locked out of the apartment .
that &apos;s a great story . can i eat it ?
and then rachel wasn &apos;t sure she could leave the baby .
it wasn &apos;t easy , but it &apos;s your birthday and i did what i had to do .
and that &apos;s judy over there at the bar with emma ?
this is for the best . i &apos;m not distracted , worrying about emma ..
how she &apos;s doing at home , and i &apos;m gonna be completely here with you .
oh , she spit up . she spit up .
what ?
judy ? she spit .. judy , look alive , judy !
thank you .
thanks .
oh , everything looks delicious .
what should i have ? what should i have ?
never hit a woman . never hit a woman .
i know what you mean , this menu &apos;s incredible .
ross bruises like a peach . he bruises like a peach .
okay , i &apos;ll have the fig salad and the duck .
i &apos;ll have the soup and the salmon .
remember , whatever comes up first , okay ?
hurry ..
happy birthday !
son of a bitch !
where have you been ?
well , we had a little fight .
i would never lie to get someone into bed .
you used to tell girls you were a kennedy .
thanks .
thanks . wow .
a little tight , isn &apos;t it ? why didn &apos;t you get a bigger table ?
you had a big table but they made you move .
shut up , monica .
oh , well , i suppose that chandler will have the smoked duck .
and i suppose that monica will have the manipulative shrew .
how did i miss that ?
i &apos;ll give you another minute .
what , where you going ?
he said she wanted the shrew !
rach , come on , emma &apos;s fine .
you &apos;re turning into an obsessive mother , okay ? you need to stop .
you ever hear the story about when ross &apos; mom went to the beauty salon ?
you mean the willy story ?
they already know it .
we &apos;ve been waiting for you for a long time .
you should order .
that &apos;s okay .
i told the waiter what they want .
why would you do that ?
chandler , control your woman .
okay , well .. everybody has ordered .
i would like to start the celebration and make a toast to phoebe .
she dropped her sock .
what ?
no . no , emma dropped her sock .
how do you know that ?
she &apos;s over there .
mom &apos;s with her .
mom &apos;s here ?
i wanted to have lunch with her today . she told me she was out of town .
she still has not noticed that the baby &apos;s sock is on the ground .
it &apos;s a good toast .
look , will you please get her attention ?
mommy ?
mother .
oh , for god &apos;s sake , judy , pick up the sock !
pick up the sock ! pick up the sock !
i &apos;m sorry , was that rude ?
did my little outburst ..
blunt the hideousness that is this evening ?
look , i know you have a lot going on ..
but all i wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday .
and you are all so late , and you didn &apos;t even have the courtesy to call .
well , it &apos;s too late now .
phoebe , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s us .
oh , well , this is .. this is not over ! hello ?
i feel terrible .
we should &apos;ve been strong and left emma at home .
&quot; we &quot; ?
there are some adult willy stories they don &apos;t know .
we should &apos;ve been stronger .
what is going on with you two ?
well , you see , i &apos;m ovulating .
oh , yeah , that &apos;s what she says .
maybe you &apos;re not ovulating . maybe it &apos;s a clever ruse to get me into bed .
yeah , smokey , that &apos;s what it was . i just can &apos;t get enough .
you &apos;re not gonna believe this .
she tricked me into having sex with her .
so ? you got to have sex , right ?
what &apos;s the matter with me ? why am i such a girl ?
okay . that was mike .
oh , phoebe , honey , we are so sorry .
you are totally right . we are here 100 percent ..
and we love you , and we are ready to start your birthday celebration .
you guys , that means the world to me .
okay , i &apos;m gonna take off .
what ?
i love you guys too , but , mike got off work early .
wait .
i &apos;m not the .. i &apos;m not the kind of girl that just ditches her friends ..
to be with her boyfriend .
you know what ? i am .
bye , guys . judy ! bye .
if phoebe &apos;s gone , can we take emma home ?
that &apos;s a good idea . our babysitter just pounded another chardonnay .
bye , you guys .
bye .
see you . well , i guess it &apos;s just us .
so , i &apos;m probably still ovulating . do you want to give it another try ?
all right .
so , you &apos;ve never had sex with a kennedy , have you ?
actually , richard was a kennedy on his mother &apos;s side .
why did you break up with that guy ?
you &apos;re gonna go do it ?
we don &apos;t have much time .
once the egg descends into the fallopian tube ..
oh , wait , oh , get out of here !
i sincerely hope the rest of your party is returning .
no , just me . all alone .
dinner for six for one .
well , you boys are about to see something really special .
how was everything ?
excellent .
the shrew , in particular , was exquisite .
i hope you &apos;ve got some room left .
joey . joey .
