if you love my sister , you won &apos;t do this !
is this some kind of a joke ?
what do you mean ?
there &apos;s nobody in there .
if we want anne to believe us ,
a picture &apos;s worth a thousand words .
oh , i see you found the guest bedroom .
would you like to take a look at the master ?
we got off the phone with your therapist .
she is recommending you spend some time apart .
are you telling me that i can &apos;t see my friends ?
are you ... ?
samara .
i go to sheridan prep .
did your friend tell you ?
yeah . s @-@ sorry .
they extended your dad &apos;s assignment .
he wants us to come to texas .
you mean for a visit ?
for a year .
make sure she gets this .
i know about the letter .
you had no right to make that decision for me .
you know what , i barely remember jason .
we didn &apos;t know him .
he was just ali &apos;s older brother down the hall .
anyone could have sent that , spence .
it could just be some kook
trying to mess with melissa .
it &apos;s not safe ? i can &apos;t tell you ?
i can &apos;t tell you what ?
where he is .
ian is dead .
there &apos;s only one way to know for sure .
&quot; how do i know this is you ? &quot;
it &apos;s him !
ian &apos;s alive .
did things just get incredibly worse ?
i can &apos;t believe this . ian &apos;s dead .
zombie &apos;s don &apos;t text !
he is alive somewhere .
spence
i have to get this phone
home before melissa realizes that it &apos;s gone .
okay , you put it back , and then what do we do ?
do we call the cops ?
oh , yeah , because that always works out so well for us .
why is ian texting melissa ?
and why is melissa answering him ?
is she ?
i mean , we don &apos;t know how long this has been going on .
spencer , look , you &apos;ve gotta find out
what ian told melissa .
you &apos;re the only one who can find out what he wants .
and where he is .
let &apos;s get out of here !
let &apos;s finish this in the morning , okay ?
i &apos;m cold , damp and scared .
we can talk at school .
we can &apos;t talk at school , remember ?
the four of us are supposed to be having &quot; separate time . &quot;
doctor &apos;s orders .
what are we supposed to do , not talk to each other ?
we &apos;re in the same classes .
we just have to play it cool .
it &apos;s jason .
did he move back in ?
what is all that ?
that &apos;s all that stuff that those people left on my curb
when ali went missing .
those tributes .
maya said her family kept those things
when they moved in .
they didn &apos;t have the heart to throw them out .
apparently jason &apos;s moved on .
what &apos;s he doing back in that house ?
mum , you don &apos;t believe in this therapy stuff ,
so why do i have to put up with it ?
because most of life consists of putting up with something .
wow . what a positive outlook .
that &apos;s gonna have a terrific impact
on my future development .
could we not talk any more until we &apos;ve had coffee ?
and why did you have to turn
on the &quot; hanna in trouble &quot; bat @-@ signal and call dad ?
i didn &apos;t . when daughters show up in news stories
about a vanishing corpse ,
fathers check in .
well , he can check in , but why does he have to come here ?
he &apos;s worried about you .
he is . i heard it when he called .
last time he came
he sprang a fiance and a step @-@ daughter on us .
wonder what we &apos;ll get this trip .
well , he sent you that nice plant
when you were in the hospital .
it died , remember .
you still have the pot .
you can &apos;t take away my phone .
i &apos;m not taking it away . you can use it all you want .
it &apos;s just when you get home from school
you gotta leave it on the dining room table .
you want to call someone , call from downstairs .
so you &apos;ll know if i &apos;m trying to talk to
aria , spencer and hanna ?
you know what ? it &apos;s a project .
you get to experience life
the way it was before we had anything other than landlines .
are we gonna start milking our own cows
and using kerosene lamps , too ?
look , emily , i know this is hard ,
but it &apos;s not mean .
i think this is a good idea .
you better start thinking about packing .
so the real estate people will know there isn &apos;t anyone living hereas
when they tramp through our house ?
actually , no more tramping .
we have a family who wants to lease the place for a year .
what do you mean , &quot; gone &quot; ?
i mean gone . blank . zeroed out .
somebody got in here and erased the whole drive .
who ?
the real estate agent &apos;s been bringing people in here all the time .
the laptop &apos;s been sitting on my desk .
are you saying that &quot; a &quot; just walked in
and wiped your drive ?
what am i talking about ? of course they did .
it &apos;s gone , spence .
all the videos of ian are gone .
yeah , except for the one ian had when he fell .
look , we &apos;re gonna talk at school , okay ?
how ?
we &apos;ll figure it out .
hey . you got out early this morning . where &apos;d you go ?
is everything okay ?
so far .
they want me to rest as much as i can .
you didn &apos;t have to go alone .
i would have gone with you .
next time .
um , any more appointments today ?
no . i &apos;m staying home .
are you gonna be back before mom and dad leave ?
that &apos;s the plan .
i could stay home if you wanted me to .
answer your phone , take messages .
no , um ... i want my phone .
in case the police call about ian .
thanks .
aria , can i see you for a second ?
your last day is friday .
day after tomorrow .
thanks for the warning .
it &apos;s ... not a warning .
all of a sudden i feel like you &apos;re picking apart
everything i say with a pair of tweezers .
no , i just ... want to make sure
that i &apos;m not misunderstanding anything .
such as ?
such as what i can really expect
once you pack up that desk .
i think i &apos;ve been very clear about that .
yeah . i know that &apos;s what you think .
i &apos;m just not so sure .
well , we &apos;re not gonna figure this out before the next bell .
you need to come by the apartment so we can talk .
i can &apos;t tonight .
tomorrow .
okay .
hey , big a ! wait up .
so , that was a bombshell , wasn &apos;t it ?
did you see it coming about him leaving ?
no .
listen , if i bend some arms ,
we could get him a gift .
and i thought you could pick it out .
why me ?
well , you know him better .
from the play .
right .
uh , sure .
i &apos;ll pick something up .
primo . i &apos;ll shake people down .
i love doin &apos; that .
um , there is this one other
really small thing i wanted to talk to you about .
anything between you and hanna ,
you &apos;re gonna have to work out on your own .
can &apos;t you just say something to her ?
mona ,
hanna and i aren &apos;t really hanging out right now .
why ? did something happen ?
did something happen ?
don &apos;t you read the papers or listen to the news ?
no .
ali &apos;s killer ?
oh . right .
you lying to the cops .
oh , we didn &apos;t lie to the cops .
people think that we did , but we didn &apos;t .
so now our parents are
thinking that we just shouldn &apos;t hang out as much .
oh . that &apos;s so unfair .
so i &apos;ll get the gift for mr. fitz ,
but i can &apos;t help you with hanna .
that &apos;s okay .
i &apos;ll come up with something .
so the videos are gone ?
totally gone .
that was our only evidence .
well , we don &apos;t have it anymore .
has ian sent melissa any more messages ?
i don &apos;t know .
she &apos;s not leaving her phone sitting around .
what about jason ? why is he back ?
and what is he doing in that house ?
maybe he &apos;s just looking for closure or something .
okay , new rule : no one can say the word &quot; closure . &quot;
ever .
dr. sullivan says it all the time .
i rest my case .
han .
what ?
i don &apos;t think we should sit together .
we always sit together .
we have to make it look like we &apos;re going along with this .
looking like we &apos;re doing it is the same thing as doing it .
it means we &apos;re wrong .
and we &apos;re not wrong ; we &apos;re right .
are we ? we don &apos;t even really know what happened .
how can we be sure if we &apos;re even right ?
that &apos;s even more reason to stick together .
you &apos;re here .
i had to get some papers from the office .
you &apos;re coming back to school ?
i haven &apos;t changed my mind .
this is about getting a g.e.d. on my own .
look , i &apos;m the one who looks guilty , not you .
you can come back if you want to .
the thing is , don &apos;t want to .
you &apos;re the one looking forward to class reunions , not me .
besides , i got a job .
check it out .
they needed somebody full @-@ time ,
and i &apos;ll be learning from the best .
i mean , sweeney put up half the houses in this town .
how are your parents about this ?
my family is the reason why i &apos;m doing it .
the sooner i &apos;ve got some money the sooner i &apos;m out of there .
for good .
out of rosewood ?
well , that depends .
on what ?
different things .
well , name three .
i can only think of one right now .
wow , you were at one with the water . that was amazing .
i did okay .
okay enough to win .
yeah , but i was off my personal time .
so , you want to grab something to eat ?
i would ,
but i promised my mom i &apos;d help her pack .
okay , how about tomorrow night ?
tomorrow ?
yeah . something to eat , maybe see a movie .
what , you don &apos;t like movies ?
no , i even like the black and white ones .
but i &apos;m moving , samara .
i don &apos;t want to start anything that i can &apos;t finish .
okay , well , um ... it is just a movie ,
so if you don &apos;t want a big commitment ,
we won &apos;t get the large popcorn .
or am i misreading things ?
no . you &apos;re not .
let &apos;s do tomorrow .
excuse me , emily ?
yes ?
hi . coach fulton said i could say hello .
my name &apos;s ken raymond , i &apos;m out here from danby .
danby u ?
yeah .
we like to check in with the talent
that &apos;s getting ready for college
and make sure that they &apos;re thinking about us .
i don &apos;t know a swimmer who isn &apos;t thinking about danby .
good . well , i &apos;d like to talk to you about our program .
so call me .
maybe we can sit down tomorrow .
okay .
great . looking forward to it .
somebody just got scouted .
no , he ... just wants to talk .
yeah , first a little talk , and then a scholarship .
you okay ?
i shouldn &apos;t read that .
they don &apos;t know anything , but they keep writing .
you want to split one of these ?
yes , i do .
who are these for ?
what makes you think they &apos;re for anybody ?
you &apos;re moving them from the box to a plate
so you can pass them off as homemade .
don &apos;t worry . i know how to keep a secret .
uh , they &apos;re for jason dilaurentis .
why ?
well , he &apos;s back , you know ?
he &apos;s just down the lane .
i thought i &apos;d be neighborly .
they were friends , weren &apos;t they ? jason and ian ?
jason ... wasn &apos;t somebody you could depend on .
did ian say that ?
i &apos;m just making conversation .
then ask me about the weather .
or the deficit . or gas prices .
you want to help ? then don &apos;t ask me about ian .
do you ...
uh ... you like this therapist ?
would it make any difference if i didn &apos;t ?
what do you think ?
i &apos;ve only talked to her on the phone .
spencer &apos;s mother put the whole thing together .
and you &apos;re okay with that ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s doing any harm ,
and right now i don &apos;t have a plan b .
okay . well , i have a plan b .
why don &apos;t we just tell everyone to mind their own business ?
let &apos;s just play this out and see what happens .
these are my friends ,
the most important people in my life right now ,
and they &apos;re trying to break us apart .
tell him !
don &apos;t put your mother on the spot like that .
hanna , this is not a good cop / bad cop situation .
we &apos;ll take it a step at a time ,
and if we have to make adjustments along the way ,
then we can do that .
you want us to email you about that ?
how about we do it face @-@ to @-@ face ?
i thought i &apos;d stay around for a couple of days .
can i go now ?
yes .
it &apos;s good to see you again , hanna .
that sound brings back memories .
were you planning to stay in town before she said that ?
yes . yes , i was .
is that gonna cause any problems for you with ... other people ?
nothin &apos; i can &apos;t handle .
well ... thanks for backing me up .
i &apos;m gonna take my lead from you on this .
i came here to help .
you want a glass of wine ?
unless you want me to make you a martini ?
i think wine tonight .
hey , emily , have you been into
your dad &apos;s side of the garage lately ?
the lockers ? no .
because one of them was open
and we &apos;re missing some winter gear ,
the camp stove ...
no , i haven &apos;t been in there .
jean watson said
that they had some stuff missing in their garage as well .
somebody broke into our garage ?
did they get into the house ? was anything else missing ?
you know what , don &apos;t ... don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ll call the police .
and did you forget something after school ?
thank you .
hey . what you doin &apos; , buddy ?
get out of here !
hello , spencer .
sorry . i saw that you were back ,
i thought i &apos;d try to beat the welcome wagon .
ah , thanks . that &apos;s great .
are your parents coming back ?
no .
it &apos;s just gonna be me for the time being .
i heard what happened . are you okay ?
i &apos;m working on it .
so you know what &apos;s been going on ?
just what i get from the news .
the cops in this town don &apos;t really talk to me .
i &apos;m the brother of a murder victim ,
but mostly they see me as a big pain in the ass .
i ask too many questions .
is that why you &apos;re back ? the questions ?
maybe i can help .
okay .
the bell tower .
what about it ?
i heard that you told the police
that ian confessed to killing ali .
is that what happened ?
that &apos;s being referred to as my &quot; version &quot; of events .
the police think ian ran away ,
but not because of your sister .
did he confess ?
yeah , i think he did .
you think he did ?
well , he wanted people to believe that i killed her .
and how did you do it , according to ian ?
i pushed her . she fell .
and it was an accident .
jason , i &apos;m sorry .
i know that you and ian were once close ...
did he say he killed her ?
that &apos;s what he meant .
that &apos;s what he meant , that &apos;s what you think .
did ian say , &quot; i killed alison &quot; ?
not those words .
not those words ?
no !
it &apos;s getting late , and ...
i &apos;ve got a lot to do inside .
can i help ?
you already have . good night .
good night .
alison ! alison , hey !
damn it , alison , come here !
come here ! hey ! stop messin &apos; with my stuff !
you and the powerpuff girls
just stay out of my room !
what are you afraid i &apos;d find in there ?
look , just stop messin &apos; with people .
no challenge with you and your little stoner buddies .
all you need is something shiny on a piece of string .
watch him , ladies .
he &apos;s got trouble with door knobs .
what &apos;s wrong with jason ?
he just thinks i stole one of his japanese cartoon porn books .
did you ?
of course i did .
aren &apos;t you afraid he &apos;s gonna rip apart your room ?
wouldn &apos;t do him any good .
i have hiding places all over the house .
in the yard , too .
when i hide something , it stays hid .
until i want it found .
that &apos;s why your secrets are all so safe with me .
emily , you &apos;re the kind of student danby would love to have .
you also fit the profile for scholarship help .
so you think i could get a scholarship ?
i think you &apos;re in good shape .
but your coach said that you were leaving the district .
that worries me .
i mean , rosewood &apos;s rated so high ,
anywhere else you go is gonna be a step down .
that could be a problem . do you know when you &apos;re moving ?
that &apos;s not definite .
oh , the coach said tha ...
there was some talk about it ,
but i &apos;m gonna finish school here .
glad to hear it .
continuity &apos;s important to you right now .
i know .
toby ?
mr. sweeney let me go .
it was your first day .
the owner of the house saw me on the crew
and told mr. sweeney they &apos;d
cancel the job if he didn &apos;t get rid of me .
why ?
they &apos;ve got a daughter .
they didn &apos;t want me in the house ,
so mr. sweeney paid me off for the week .
he can not do that !
forget it , spencer .
it &apos;s just how this town works .
get in .
tell you what , let &apos;s ... let &apos;s talk later .
this was your idea .
i know . and i promise i will be there . but ...
this is the head of the department .
but you knew that you had to talk to him
when you asked me to come over .
yes , but i didn &apos;t know that they only spoke in paragraphs .
look , i will get out of here , i will be there ,
we will talk .
one second . sorry .
wait for me .
please .
aria ?
okay .
i &apos;ll wait .
be there soon .
mr. raymond said
i was the kind of student they want .
i mean , he just about promised me a full scholarship .
but he said he couldn &apos;t do it if i moved ,
if i ended up at another school in a different program .
if i stay here and graduate from rosewood ,
i could have everything i want at danby .
but if we move , it &apos;s all gonna fall apart .
this is a lot to think about , emily .
but you are thinking about it ?
well , we gotta talk to your dad ,
but i think he &apos;d agree this would be a reason to stay .
but ... this family &apos;s not doing anything
based on one conversation with one scout , okay ?
we can &apos;t just do this on promises .
we need some kind of a commitment from the university .
no problem . i &apos;ll talk to mr. raymond .
how did it go with ezra ?
oh , he &apos;s not here yet .
he &apos;s at hollis , stuck in a meeting .
how long have you been waiting ?
over an hour .
look , that &apos;s why i was calling , spence .
how long should i wait ?
why are you asking me ?
because you &apos;ve got this great internal clock .
like you always know exactly
how long to wait for a boy to call you ,
when to ask your parents for something ,
how quickly you should make up with somebody ...
you are the master of time .
um , can i call you back later ?
sure .
sorry . bye .
can you get out ?
um ... yeah .
let me just get my coat .
hey , hanna , it &apos;s mona .
i &apos;ve been trying your phone a lot .
call me . please , i miss you .
bye .
something wrong with your phone ?
no .
you want some help with that ?
nope .
look , i know it &apos;s tough
not seeing your friends .
but it &apos;s a good idea , under the circumstances .
do you notice
how i never see you except when i &apos;m in trouble ?
do you think that &apos;s significant ?
i mean , should i bring it up in therapy ?
i &apos;m sorry it seems that way .
no , don &apos;t apologize ,
because it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
so don &apos;t .
does mean something .
maybe to you , but not to me .
why not ?
when you and mom broke up ,
you told me that
even though you were getting a divorce
it didn &apos;t mean i wasn &apos;t always going to be your daughter ...
and now ...
you &apos;re getting a whole new family .
you lied to me , so i don &apos;t trust you .
nobody ever made a mistake on purpose , hanna .
you always think you &apos;re doing what &apos;s best ...
at least that &apos;s what you tell yourself after the fact .
the thing i can &apos;t explain , the thing i can &apos;t forgive ,
is talking myself into leaving you behind .
it &apos;s amazing how much damage can be done
when you have nothing but good intentions .
all i need is a letter
just something in writing ,
and i won &apos;t have to move .
i can finish at rosewood .
and you think you can get that from the scout ?
absolutely .
that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s beyond great .
i feel like i can breathe again .
what is it ?
you went somewhere just now . what was it ?
nothing . i &apos;m fine .
did you come here with someone ?
maya .
do you want to go someplace else ?
no . no , i &apos;m fine , really .
if you &apos;re okay .
i don &apos;t know .
ghosts of first girlfriends make tough competition .
what ... sort of competition would i be looking at ?
i mean , for the sake of argument .
well , i don &apos;t kiss and tell , but i had a maya .
everybody has a maya .
if they &apos;re lucky .
who was she ?
her name was marianne ginari .
sophomore english ,
one row over , two seats down .
she always wore her hair up ,
and i kept looking at the back of her neck .
what happened ?
we had a study date one night ,
and she let her hair down .
are you alone ,
or is noel kahn lurking around here somewhere ?
all by my lonesome .
so , are you going out with noel , or was that just a one @-@ off ?
well , he &apos;s a major get .
now he even has some bad boy cred .
well , you know , there &apos;s bad , and then there &apos;s bad .
i would just be careful around him .
so , you want me to be careful ?
like it would make a difference to you ?
look , i guess i understand why you did what you did .
you must have thought you were doing me a favor .
really , truly i did .
could we just forget about it ?
okay .
so , does this mean that you , like , forgive me ?
yeah ... i forgive you .
no one &apos;s ever forgiven me before .
it feels all , i don &apos;t know , spiritual or something .
sit with me ?
so , have you , like , talked to caleb ?
you don &apos;t ask me about caleb
and i won &apos;t ask you about noel .
okay .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i &apos;m telling you now .
you should have told me
the minute you found out he was texting her .
why ? what could you have done ?
i &apos;d have done something .
what ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , welcome to my world .
it &apos;s not so bad from up here .
just looks like a town .
that &apos;s all it is .
more than that .
it &apos;s like one of those
collective mind creatures in the movies .
one with a really long memory .
it &apos;s not a monster .
it &apos;s got monsters in it .
you know that . so do i.
i &apos;ll do what you want me to .
you want me to tell the police
that ian &apos;s been texting melissa ?
remind me--
when was the last time the cops did either of us any good ?
so ?
so ...
spence ?
spence !
spencer , are you here ?
spencer !
i &apos;ve called the police ,
everything looks all right upstairs .
are you sure you &apos;re okay ?
yeah .
my dignity broke the fall .
aria ...
hey . are you sure that you &apos;re okay ?
yeah . yeah , i @-@ i &apos;m fine .
the fact that &quot; a &quot; can just ...
break into our houses .
sometimes i think that &apos;s the worst part of this .
emily said that somebody broke into their garage
and stole some camping gear .
and her mom said that
there &apos;s been a whole bunch of break @-@ ins around town .
what would &quot; a &quot; want with camping gear ?
you tell me .
what if it &apos;s not &quot; a &quot; ?
who else would it be ?
somebody who knew what was on emily &apos;s computer .
somebody who needs camping gear and survival stuff ,
somebody who &apos;s on the run .
ian ?
we thought that &quot; a &quot; wiped emily &apos;s hard drive
because that &apos;s the kind of thing that &quot; a &quot; would do ,
but ian is the only other person who would want those videos destroyed .
do you think that that was ian upstairs ?
i don &apos;t know .
melissa &apos;s out in the barn .
what would he want in the house ?
you ?
that &apos;s great .
my mom &apos;s really excited .
she just wants a letter to show my dad .
a letter .
you know , explaining the whole offer .
i &apos;d be happy to talk to your mom and dad ,
but we were discussing what could happen--
i can &apos;t offer you anything in writing .
you said if i kept up my grades and times
and graduated rosewood ,
i could get into danby on a scholarship .
you &apos;re a very strong contender .
i &apos;d need more than that for my parents .
i need some sort of commitment .
i can write down something saying
that we &apos;re interested in you ,
but i can &apos;t make promises .
so all i can get is a &quot; maybe &quot; letter ?
that &apos;s what i can do now .
okay . thank you .
we &apos;ll talk soon .
thank you .
wasn &apos;t expecting this .
to be honest , most of what &apos;s happened to me here
i didn &apos;t expect .
i didn &apos;t expect to connect with you the way that i have .
i never expected to feel this kind of loss over leaving you .
stop me when this gets too maudlin ,
but i &apos;m not going to forget you .
i will remember your voices ,
your questions , your ... faces .
i cherish the time that i &apos;ve spent here ,
and i &apos;m more grateful than i even know how to say .
there &apos;s a quote by joseph campbell ,
and it goes ...
&quot; you must give up the life you had planned
in order to have the life that is waiting for you . &quot;
i thought i knew what that meant .
i didn &apos;t .
till i met you .
well , there it is .
oh ! oh . always read . have a good life .
we love you , mr. fitz .
good luck .
thanks , mr. fitz .
doris .
thanks , mr. fitz .
ezra .
hey . sorry i &apos;m late .
didn &apos;t notice .
you want something to eat ?
i &apos;m okay .
did you get outside today ?
not in this weather . i never left the house .
it was in the pocket of her raincoat .
and her raincoat was wet . so were her boots .
she lied to you about being out ?
well , she didn &apos;t go far . i checked the driveway ,
and it was dry under her car ,
so it hadn &apos;t been moved all day .
who would she want to show this to ?
i can only think of one person who would care .
ian .
if she didn &apos;t take the car , that means he must be close .
