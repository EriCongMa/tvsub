this is russell borchert , computer genius ,
anti @-@ deodorant activist , and millionaire .
he was rich for having invented the 9 @-@ track cassette ,
which the 8 @-@ track industry paid to keep quiet .
he funneled that wealth into a computer school called greendale ,
where he obsessively pursued a new project ,
a machine that can process feelings .
he apparently used nothing but gold to assemble his circuitry ,
believing it to be a better conductor of human emotion .
it was a weird time . the bionic woman won an emmy .
rumors spread about his relationship with computers ,
and one day , he disappeared ,
hence the legend that he died of the first computer virus .
the city bought the campus , and life went on .
his body was never found , nor was his immense wealth .
some people said he hid his money
using a portal to another dimension .
those people were on lsd .
everyone else said
he had a secret vault in his office .
well , where &apos;s his office ?
good question .
we found this confession
written by greendale &apos;s first dean .
&quot; to protect the student health and the school &apos;s reputation ,
&quot; i have sealed off the computer department
and removed the stairwell to that entire section . &quot;
a section that remains on this campus somewhere ,
its secrets untouched ,
including quite possibly borchert &apos;s millions .
if we found it ,
we could buy it from the city before subway .
then i could really go nuts with this place .
this is the kind of adventure i usually have to force upon us ,
and here it is , falling into our laps .
we &apos;re like the goonies ,
except our story tracks logically
and has a chance of holding up to objective critical scrutiny .
can you please stop that ?
sorry .
here are your blueprints . sorry it took so long .
you can &apos;t fight city hall .
apparently you can . that &apos;s why it took so long .
well , i &apos;ll be damned . would you look at that ?
it &apos;s so clear now .
the entire school is shaped like a penis .
no , that .
it says right here that this stairway leads to sublevel three .
is that where the teachers &apos; lounge is ?
what the hell does your penis look like ?
obviously a cluster of buildings ,
so let &apos;s all have a big laugh at the freak .
the missing stairwell would be in this area .
keep your eyes peeled .
i don &apos;t know why , but serial killers and people that
hide treasure always leave weird little clues .
check it out .
look at the bottle held by the school &apos;s
first and least acceptable mascot ,
big chief drunky .
x marks the spot , baby .
maybe you shouldn &apos;t be-- okay .
shirley , will you lock the door ?
okay .
there you go .
it &apos;s just a bunch of wires .
exactly what they want us to think .
oh , my god .
wait , wait , wait .
the sparks may be spelling out the next clue .
is duncan okay ?
he &apos;ll live ,
but his food &apos;s gonna taste like burnt aluminum for a while .
it &apos;s pronounced &quot; al @-@ u @-@ minium . &quot;
see , he &apos;s fine .
okay , guys , stop it now .
nobody wants to admit its over ,
but come on .
oh , look , it &apos;s jeff winger , fun police ,
here to pull over our smiles
&apos;cause our mouths have tinted windows .
britta and i are getting married .
what ?
married ?
well , you &apos;re gonna need way more doves than this .
what does this look like ,
an hour @-@ long episode of the office ?
there &apos;s pick @-@ axing and electric zapping .
don &apos;t even acknowledge it . we are not acknowledging this .
you guys are ridiculous together .
we &apos;re ridiculous ? what do you call this ?
secret trapdoor !
booyah .
who &apos;s got rope ?
i &apos;m offended by that question .
this is richie and carl from the school board .
that &apos;s right . we got names .
open this door now .
wait , i know where the keys are .
you hear that ?
when we get there , you &apos;re gonna be in big trouble .
here they are . here they are .
which one is it ?
well , it &apos;s never the first one ,
so we can cancel this one out .
come on .
i guess now this is the first one ,
so it should be the next one .
oh , damn .
you know what ?
i got it . get out of the way .
richie , be careful .
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ve been drinking .
oh , hello . would you like some tea ?
the tea is swell .
do you think they ...
shh .
i think--
shh .
oh , come on , shh .
shh .
you know it &apos;s just as loud as--
everybody , shut up !
guys , i think this is the lost section of greendale .
nobody &apos;s been in here since the &apos; 70s .
how do you know ?
because the debate team topic is &quot; who &apos;s hotter ,
后者曾参演冯小刚的 「 大腕 」
elliot gould or donald sutherland ? &quot;
donald sutherland .
scary .
oh , relax .
if it &apos;s anything like a regular dungeon ,
it &apos;s only as dangerous as whoever invited you .
abed , if there &apos;s killer robots down here ,
you &apos;ll tell them we &apos;re on your side , right ?
yes , but we won &apos;t know them from ordinary robots
until they kill us .
so what do we do now ?
split up .
leave no &apos; 70s reference unturned .
this decade &apos;s a little out of my wheelhouse .
pet rock ... leave no pet rock unturned .
here , let me lead . my light &apos;s better .
your light &apos;s better ?
you &apos;re that insecure that your light has to be better ?
shut up .
you shut up .
anything in there ?
just spider webs and beanbag chairs .
oh , don &apos;t cry .
the importance of lumbar support hadn &apos;t ...
it &apos;s not that .
it &apos;s just even if we do save greendale ,
which greendale will we be saving ?
first pierce dies . then troy leaves .
now people are ... - getting married ?
annie , look , i don &apos;t know people ,
but i know tv .
when characters feel like the show they &apos;re on is ending ,
their instinct is to spin off into something safer ,
in jeff and britta &apos;s case ,
something that would last six episodes
and have a lot of bickering about tweezers and gluten ,
starring them and an equally waspy
brunette couple with a title like better with my worse half
or awfully wedded or tying the not ,
but &quot; knot &quot; is spelt without a k ,
or hot topics couple people problems ...
abed .
and every episode , you get ...
abed . abed , stop developing .
sorry .
the point is , this show , annie ,
it isn &apos;t just their show .
this is our show , and it &apos;s not over .
and the sooner we find that treasure ,
the faster the jeff @-@ britta pilot falls apart .
got it . thank you , abed .
you &apos;re welcome .
i have a girlfriend .
what ?
you were about to start a kiss lean .
i was not .
fine .
let &apos;s go find treasure .
did you find anything ?
no .
we &apos;ve searched every crevice of this place ,
and the only treasures we &apos;ve found are this cb radio ,
these basketball cards with white people on them ,
and this little rocket launcher from some action figure .
seems like an odd place for a dead end , though .
could be a secret door .
maybe the jukebox is the key to it .
just remember , it &apos;s okay if we fail .
right , jeff ?
that &apos;s right .
agh , try every button .
just try every single button ever .
are you all right ?
no ! i was dying !
try track 127 .
right .
because 127 in binary code would be a palindrome .
because the song title is open the door by the secret doors .
open the door
yeah
we got to open the door
and the door is opening
you &apos;re the playing the song that opens the door
we recorded this song for when you open the door
specially timed to the duration
of the opening process
borchert &apos;s secret lab .
that &apos;s the machine borchert was working on in the film .
borchert &apos;s gold .
we need to get this upstairs .
save greendale .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re russell borchert , aren &apos;t you ?
hey , i &apos;m gonna peel off some band @-@ aids here .
dennis hopper is dead ,
tv shows give no time for theme songs anymore ,
and woody allen did the voice of a cartoon ant .
jeff !
sorry , i lose track of how big i &apos;m getting .
i don &apos;t .
you vandalized private property .
you nearly destroy the school
when it &apos;s finally about to make a profit ?
you guys are the worst ,
with your stupid paintballs and your freeze tags .
hot lava .
that was hot lava ?
dumb .
tell us where the others went .
guys , guys .
what do you want to do ?
what should we do ?
well , what can we do ?
okay .
i &apos;m gonna need you guys to stay back
and never tell anyone about what you saw here today .
you &apos;re special , richie . your mind is special .
you know it works differently from other kids &apos; minds .
richie &apos;s a freak
richie &apos;s a freak
thank you .
i know where they went .
they climbed out a window to the roof ,
hopped on a hang glider ,
and flew it across town to that greek restaurant ,
papa cristo &apos;s ?
i robbed your brain . i robbed it .
hey , guys , we found a hatch in the floor
underneath the vending machine .
i think they went down inside it .
was there a hang glider ?
you &apos;re gonna find out--
you &apos;re gonna find a hang glider down there .
that much i know .
so anyway , i sealed myself up down here
with 50 years of food , 50 years of toilet paper ,
and 50 years of cocaine ,
which i somehow ran out of after about 10 years .
wow , the &apos; 80s happened down here too .
yeah .
hey , what are you doing with raquel ?
russell , we &apos;re on a bit of a deadline ,
and to put it bluntly , we need your gold .
raquel !
uh , guys , little help--
she just needs a little more time .
sir , raquel has taken the best years of your life
and a dozen of your not @-@ so @-@ good .
if she hasn &apos;t given anything back ,
it might be time to move on .
stop . you guys , what are we doing ?
saving greendale .
from what ?
we were driven down here by sellouts with crappy values .
since when do human beings decide
which dreams are worthwhile ?
look at him . he &apos;s one of us .
we have to respect each other enough
to let each other want what we want ,
no matter how transparently self @-@ destructive
or empty our desires may be .
if it was money that you guys wanted ,
why didn &apos;t you say so ?
you can just have my leftover cash
that &apos;s under the desk over there .
yeah , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s worth much up there .
those are gerald ford dollars .
how many ?
eh , couple of million .
back in the &apos; 70s , that was worth millions .
hey , i &apos;ve got an idea .
how about you people leave me alone
and i hereby grant that to greendale ?
what ?
glad to hear it .
get back . this pickle &apos;s a magnet .
whoa , whoa .
i &apos;ll wipe her out , man .
don &apos;t you dare use that pickle--
get over there with them .
you have no legal claim to that money .
take it up with subway in about an hour
after close of escrow .
hey , chang , you &apos;ve become a bad guy again ?
there &apos;s a lot more to it than that , britta .
wait , i &apos;m not wearing a mask ?
okay , there &apos;s no more to it . i think i &apos;m just mentally ill .
all right , just stay back . all right ?
no , don &apos;t .
no !
yeah , sweet mama .
the door is closing
faster than it opens .
for dramatic effect
hang in there .
raquel is the main operating system .
she controls the door , the lights ,
the shower probably , everything ,
and now she &apos;s dead .
so we &apos;re trapped in here forever .
or just until we run out of food and water .
at least we &apos;ll have each other .
till death do us part .
you know what ? you guys can have my food and water .
come on , raquel . come on .
baby . come on .
oh , thank god .
her emotional components are still on @-@ line .
emotional components ?
i have accomplished things down here
you couldn &apos;t even possibly imagine .
here , let me show you .
ah , right there ! that was it .
that was it . did you see it ?
don &apos;t you see ? this computer responds to feelings .
when i started greendale , it was for ordinary people
to be able to access technology .
wait , you started greendale .
do you have that in writing anywhere ?
i don &apos;t know . somewhere with all that crap over there .
but without an emotional component ,
computers would strip us of all humanity
and create a society
with emotionless eggheads at the top
and idiots with feelings at the bottom ,
and i refuse to let that happen , and that &apos;s why i &apos;ve spent--
what ? what is that ?
it &apos;s a video of a kitten .
and why are those people arguing about it ?
and what &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s an emoticon .
that person wants to indicate happiness
but can &apos;t convey it with language ,
so they misuse punctuation to form a smile .
that is so ...
stupid .
only an idiot would think of this .
idiots won ,
which means my work down here is done .
good , because according to what i &apos;m seeing ,
if we can get you up there right now ,
subway won &apos;t be buying this school .
what ?
what ?
uh , yeah , but it &apos;s gonna take a few hours
to get that door open ,
because raquel &apos;s logic circuits--
bleh , not good .
you said her emotional components work .
well , in theory ,
a blast of human passion
could shock the mainframe into a cold start ,
but that &apos;s only if somebody in this room
has feelings stronger than i get when i rub my nipples ,
so good luck with that , folks .
give me that .
everybody over there . turn around .
turn around now .
you &apos;re here to save me , aren &apos;t you ?
let &apos;s get out of here and never look back .
jeff , in case you ever have to remember me ,
can i give you some options for voice @-@ over quotes ?
shut up , abed .
milady .
milord .
what did you do ?
don &apos;t worry about it . let &apos;s go .
the city of greendale is proud
to be selling the school of greendale to subway .
this brings to an end several years
of horrible management by dean craig isidore pelton .
not to throw anyone under the bus ,
but he &apos;d be the one .
and by my watch ,
it is about time to sign these documents
and make it official .
objection !
i teach law at greendale ,
so believe me , i don &apos;t know much about law ,
but i do know a contract violation when i see one .
this is a legitimate transaction
where a city is selling a school to a restaurant .
it happens somewhere every day .
oh , the city can sell the school all it wants ,
but according to his contract with the city ,
the school &apos;s original founder retains the privilege of consultation
on all future scholastic endeavors taking place here .
so subway sandwich university ,
meet your new vice dean , russell borchert .
hi , i guess we &apos;re gonna be partners .
i understand there &apos;s some internet
where i can make my inner thoughts public .
it seems like greendale the city
and greendale the school have some stuff to sort out ,
and subway doesn &apos;t-- doesn &apos;t do conflict .
we do good food at good prices .
we are but simple sandwich artists
who want the world to eat fresh .
eat fresh !
subway , ho !
did we just save greendale ?
did we just save greendale ?
no , no , you did not .
you moved dirt around greendale &apos;s grave .
your school is still bankrupt , it is still unmarketable ,
and it is still on the permanent chopping block
of anyone who has any say in its future .
yeah ?
well , around here , we call that wednesday .
hey , after i was electrocuted ,
didn &apos;t you two say you were gonna get married ?
doesn &apos;t electrocuted technically mean killed ?
do you always have to correct people like that ?
do you always have to police correcting ?
that &apos;s it . the marriage is off .
i think you mean the wedding is off .
yeah !
hey , hey .
hey , i got to say ,
you held up well under that interrogation .
i &apos;m gonna tell you something
that i &apos;d like to stay between us .
i was thinking about a hang glider .
none of this conflict truly matters .
the only owners of this land are the arapaho .
would it offend you if i asked you
to train me in the use of certain powers ?
sorry , carl . you deserve better .
chang , you get it .
how would you like a job on the school board ?
okay .
your first job is to deliver this
to the city bursar &apos;s office .
on it .
hi , yes , i &apos;d like to replace all my teeth with diamonds .
we live to fight another day .
speaking of days , i never got a chance to wish you
a happy birthday or halloween or christmas
or any specific calendar event .
well , maybe next year .
definitely .
we &apos;ll definitely be back next year .
if not , it &apos;ll be because an asteroid
has destroyed all human civilization ,
and that &apos;s canon .
what ? what are you--
nothing .
am i thinking what you &apos;re thinking ?
penny for your thoughts .
intensive karen .
mr. egypt .
celebrity beat @-@ off .
captain cook .
depends on what fails .
