damon &apos;s gone !
i want you to compel me to forget that
i ever loved him .
who is damon salvatore ?
he was a monster .
where the hell are we ?
1994 .
we &apos;re never getting out .
there &apos;s someone else here .
to get home , we &apos;ll harness the power of the eclipse
using a mystical relic .
it &apos;s called an ascendant .
you &apos;re doing that thing again .
what thing ?
oh , the thing where you &apos;re a bitch
because you like somebody .
that &apos;s my girlfriend ivy .
somebody killed her last night right in front of me .
ivy .
your friend enzo made me drink his blood ,
and now i &apos;m just so thirsty .
vampires murdered my wife .
and i &apos;m gonna get him to name all his vampire buddies .
hello ?
tripp cook .
just wanted to thank you for turning over that vampire enzo to me .
he &apos;s been very helpful .
enzo ? i thought , um--
i thought you were supposed to kill him .
oh , i will
eventually once i know everything he does .
so what has he told you ?
sounds like the vampire problem
in mystic falls isn &apos;t as bad as i thought .
i mean , if he had any names , he &apos;d have given them up .
lord knows i &apos;ve done plenty of things to get him to talk .
well , that &apos;s good to hear .
yeah . seems like it &apos;s moved on to savannah .
i &apos;ve sent some of my guys down there .
they &apos;re gonna check it out , see what they find .
thanks for the , uh , heads @-@ up .
founding families
got to stick together , right ?
absolutely .
ivy ?
you redecorated .
i should probably tell you i killed your boss dean .
i woke up when he was burying me in the woods .
i drank every drop of his blood ,
but it wasn &apos;t enough .
yeah . i know the feeling .
then why weren &apos;t you helping me ?
i &apos;m trying to help you .
two blood bags and a lesson on sunlight ?
thanks a million .
listen . i have to get you out of savannah .
i am dead because of you ,
because you lied to me about who you were ,
because your friend enzo turned me into something
straight out of &quot; buffy the vampire slayer . &quot;
ivy , calm down . when you &apos;re a vampire ,
your emotions are heightened .
you think ? ! look at me !
i used to be a decent person .
i got good grades , i when home for christmas ,
i had a fricking etsy store !
ivy , please .
and now i am a killer ,
and all i am gonna do is kill more and more ,
and it &apos;s all your fault .
stefan ? what are you--
i need a favor .
what are you doing ,
and what is with this trunk ?
hang on .
oh , my god !
where i am i ? what did you do ?
ivy ? how did this happen ?
enzo turned her .
then stefan broke my neck ,
and i woke up in a trunk .
right . so i need a little bit of help .
no .
no . no , no .
just watch her for a little while
while i get luke to make her a daylight ring .
show her the ropes , teach her some control , please .
no , no . this is not my mess .
please .
this is your mess .
a mess that wouldn &apos;t have happened if you had just left me alone .
i can hear you , you know ?
i can hear everything , like , perfectly .
do i need to remind you that there is a vampire hunter
lurking around ?
he &apos;s not here . he &apos;s in savannah ,
which is why we &apos;re not .
you know the real tragedy in all this ?
i read &quot; he &apos;s just not that into you , &quot; and--
shut up !
look . tripp cook has somehow decided
to become the eastern seaboard &apos;s self @-@ proclaimed vampire hunter .
none of us are safe if we can &apos;t control ourselves .
if anybody can teach her , it &apos;s you .
yeah ? well , you don &apos;t have to flatter me because i already know that .
all right ? so just a couple of hours ,
and then you &apos;ll never have to deal with me again .
is that what you think i want ?
i don &apos;t know . you tell me .
ok .
when do we eat ?
&quot; homecoming . &quot;
all right . by a show of hands ,
who knows the supernatural origin of tonight &apos;s homecoming party ?
a civil war soldier nathan whitmore
horribly disfigured throughout countless battles
somehow survived them all just so he could get home
to the woman he loved ,
and when he finally got home to his farm ,
he found her in bed with his brother ,
and did what any sane man would do--
he murdered his brother in cold blood
and then chased the love of his life
out into the cornfields .
i got to run some gear over to the football stadium later .
if you want , i could pick you up after ,
and we could go together .
you mean , like a date ?
because definitely not .
but the legend goes ...
that lady whitmore is out on this night
every year dressed in white ,
covered in her lover &apos;s blood ,
running through the cornfields ,
screaming for her life .
and the moral of the story is ?
do not fall in love ,
especially with your brother &apos;s girl .
all right , kids . you have a fun night tonight .
be safe .
you know , that cautionary tale
would have had more of an impact on me about two weeks ago .
damon may be gone , but i can still find
pleasure in judging his life choices .
speaking of which , have you changed your mind
about me compelling you to forget about him yet ?
why do you say , &quot; yet , &quot; as if i &apos;m gonna wake up one day
and realize that my life is over
if i don &apos;t have the traumatic memories of loving a serial killer ?
had to ask .
you know , maybe you &apos;re right .
maybe i am making a huge mistake ,
or maybe i got a very valuable piece of advice
from myself about how to be happy
and i intend on taking it .
am i gonna see you at the party tonight ?
you know , i &apos;m waiting on the mixer
for thirtysomething vampires just back from the dead .
less of a crowd .
come on , ric .
you are like one hoodie and 3 missed haircuts
away from becoming professor shane .
i am perfectly content staying at home ,
letting my hair grow out .
you &apos;re hiding .
you &apos;re becoming a self @-@ loathing vampire hermit .
tell you what . you &apos;ve been given the chance to start over .
take it . be happy .
i am happy ... ish .
exactly . i &apos;ll see you at 8 : 00
but not in that t @-@ shirt . you &apos;ve worn it twice this week .
there you are . good .
are you going out tonight ?
on the friday of homecoming weekend ?
no . i &apos;m studying .
sarcasm . what an unexpected response .
i think you should come to the corn maze with me .
a corn maze ?
will dorothy and toto be joining us ?
hilarious .
you know , there &apos;s an actual sientific word
for why people go to these invents .
and what &apos;s that ?
fun .
do you feel like having some with me ?
that depends . are you gonna try
and set me up with any more of your friends ?
that depends .
are you gonna kiss me out of the blue again ?
not when you say it like that .
i got to go . more people to invite .
you &apos;re inviting multiple people to be your date tonight .
i &apos;m inviting multiple people to join in on the fun .
as for who my date will be ,
well , that depends on you .
you &apos;re in a good mood
for the first time this decade .
stop that .
because i have a hot date with my girl tonight .
yeah , assuming kai &apos;s telling the truth .
i &apos;m thinking dinner and a movie .
you know what ? screw the dinner and a movie .
skip straight to the good part .
yeah . and assuming i can do the spell ,
which i won &apos;t know until i see it .
whatever happened to hope , bon ?
remember when i was all like , &quot; boo , grr , &quot;
and you were all &quot; hooray , hooray .
we &apos;re getting out of here ! &quot;
look . i want to go home more than anything ,
but kai &apos;s a sociopath .
who &apos;s to say he won &apos;t screw us over ?
me . i say because i will kill kai
and anyone who comes in the way of me going home .
i heard my name .
all good i hope .
the eclipse will happen directly overhead
in perfect alignment with the gemini constellation .
you need to dig into the tunnels below us .
we &apos;ll do the spell there .
why ?
have you never portal jumped through an eclipse before ?
ok . look . the light of the eclipse
will shine down and activate the ascendant .
you spout a little witchy woo , and then poof !
anyone standing in the circle of light
holding the ascendant goes home .
by witchy woo , i assume you mean the spell .
let me see it .
when the time comes .
where are you going ?
into town . i need to gather some important supplies .
well , what do you think ?
i think you &apos;re wearing my dress ,
and you must be deaf
because i already said the party &apos;s not happening .
so you &apos;d rather be locked in a dorm room with a newbie vampire ?
no . i would rather be at the party
just like i &apos;d rather have friends
who didn &apos;t ignore me for months
and then use me when they need help .
just realized why stefan brought me here to learn control .
do yourself a favor . unwind .
just admit you have a thing for him .
excuse me ?
i saw the way you looked at him that night you came over for dinner .
you practically cut his food for him .
you know , my relationship with stefan is strictly ... complicated , ok ?
aren &apos;t you supposed to be practicing your vamping or something ?
done . see ? i &apos;m fine .
you already put your number into my phone
as my emergency vampire contact .
i know i burn in the sun ,
we covered compulsion and snatch , eat , erase .
look . it &apos;s getting dark . let &apos;s go party .
you can teach me how to eat someone without killing them .
stefan will be here very soon ,
and then you can do whatever you want with him .
can we at least play a board game
or do something non @-@ vampire related .
finally a good idea .
what kind of game do you want to play ?
i don &apos;t know . scrabble .
i have tournament , classic ,
and travel @-@ sized .
what &apos;s dr. laughlin doing here ?
looking hot .
i thought the lab coat was permanently attached .
i invited her .
it &apos;s kind of a setup ,
only neither party knows about it .
come on .
time to get your kansas on .
stefan , hey . this is the third message
alerting you that your psychotic little she @-@ vamp
has gone awol ,
and if you hadn &apos;t noticed , it &apos;s dark outside ,
so every dead sorority girl tonight is officially on you .
grading on the curve , huh ?
you know , this barely makes a dent .
can &apos;t fault me for trying , though .
you want some ?
no . i just came here to get one of these from luke .
let me guess .
you played the &quot; damon is dead , and it &apos;s all your fault &quot; card .
what do you want , stefan ?
enzo turned a vampire when he and caroline found me .
you mean your girlfriend from savannah .
the one you falsely led me to believe
was a witch who knew how to help damon and bonnie ?
her name &apos;s ivy .
i was hoping you can compel her to get a handle on things ,
get somewhere far away from me ,
live a good life .
are you asking me to help you with a breakup ?
i &apos;m just asking you to give her a fresh start .
you mean give you a fresh start .
sorry , stefan . it &apos;s not that easy .
well , it was when you compelled elena to forget about damon .
well , you forgot about him first , pal .
he was my brother .
yeah , and he was my best friend .
why don &apos;t you get out of my face
before i compel you to be the guy i used to know instead ?
you scared me .
really ? that wasn &apos;t scary ,
but this is .
there . i snatched , i ate ,
now erase .
erase what ?
what the hell are you doing to me ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t think i did it right ,
and i &apos;m still hungry .
oh , my god . i am totally gonna kill you .
you should go , run . seriously .
i suck at this .
you know there &apos;s a very probable chance you &apos;re digging your own grave
and not bothered .
looks like i got back just in time .
zima , grunge ,
every alex rodriguez rookie card in demand ,
and a pager . really ?
555 @-@ hiya @-@ kai . no way i &apos;m giving those digits up .
these were the important supplies you had to get ?
look . the future sound great , all right ?
i &apos;m superexcited about the internet ,
but 1994 has been my home for most of my life .
i &apos;d hate to get homesick .
so let &apos;s get down there .
no .
we are not going anywhere
until you show me the spell .
ok .
are we literally not going anywhere ?
fine . you don &apos;t want to show me the spell ,
then you can do it yourself .
you want my magic .
take it .
she &apos;s being brave .
i &apos;m serious , kai . this was your big threat , wasn &apos;t it ?
if i do the spell and let us out of here ,
you &apos;ll just take my magic , leave me for dead ,
and do the spell yourself .
so go ahead .
take all of it .
don &apos;t mind if i do .
bonnie ?
it &apos;s ok . he won &apos;t kill me .
doesn &apos;t look like that from here .
bonnie .
guys .
stop !
he doesn &apos;t know the spell ,
which means we don &apos;t need him .
motus .
no ! no !
bonnie !
great work , bonnie .
i think i recognize this scarecrow .
you &apos;ve said that about every scarecrow .
ok . well , then we are officially lost .
actually , it &apos;s 2 lefts and 3 rights .
i pulled up a satellite image of this maze before i came .
competitive type . got it .
question is , am i your type ?
honestly , no ,
but people can change , right ?
what ?
you &apos;re still hung up on your ex .
overly ambitious premed student , desperate to become a doctor
so she can prove to the guy who dumped her
that he messed up big time .
actually , he died .
or that .
sorry . i thought stefan was--
no .
yikes .
yeah .
it &apos;s ok , it &apos;s ok .
his name was damon ,
but tonight isn &apos;t about him .
it &apos;s about you and me .
not cool !
professor bourbon .
perfect timing .
imagine you see a lot worse in e.r.
everything i see there is natural ,
gross but natural .
zombies , ghosts , the undead not cool .
good to know .
you haven &apos;t seen elena around here , have you ?
she basically blackmailed me into coming tonight .
let me guess . she told you to get out of the classroom ,
live a little ?
we &apos;re being set up . ok .
now why don &apos;t you be a gentleman
and get me the hell out of here
because we are way too old for this party ,
and i need a drink stat .
i thought you were a germaphobe .
i &apos;ll make an exception .
see ? i told you it would be fun .
speak of the devil .
oh , god .
oh , no .
help .
somebody help us over here , please !
i don &apos;t know . i can &apos;t find him .
elena !
elena , get over there .
oh , god . oh , my god .
h @-@ how bad is it ?
ok . i got this .
i &apos;m not sure there &apos;s anything you can do .
i &apos;ll do everything that i can .
just go see if you can help someone else , all right ?
come on . go .
listen to me .
you dove out of the way just in time .
you were very lucky .
now get out of here and take as many people as you can , ok ?
come on .
tyler ?
i was driving the truck , elena .
what ?
this guy ran right in front of me ,
and he &apos;s hurt bad .
if he dies ,
i &apos;m a werewolf all over again , ok ?
i need you to get here . we &apos;re in a ditch .
i don &apos;t know where , but i need you here now ,
so please hurry .
tyler , you don &apos;t understand .
you drove right through the maze .
there are injured people everywhere .
what the hell am i supposed to do ?
just--listen . just hang on .
um , make sure that you keep him awake .
assess his injuries while i go find jo and alaric .
you &apos;re bleeding .
i &apos;m fine .
no , you &apos;re not . let me see .
wait . what the hell ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s my blood .
oh . ok . that &apos;s gonna make things more difficult .
i really think i should get you out of here .
no . that &apos;s not an option .
you look pale . does blood make you squeamish ?
yeah . something like that .
don &apos;t worry . you &apos;ll get used to it .
call 911 , follow me .
ok .
thank god !
you lost her ?
oh , so you decide to listen to your messages a million hours later ?
no . i didn &apos;t lose her .
she snapped my neck .
what the hell took you so long ?
i got caught up .
you got caught up , doing what ?
driving halfway out of town .
you were leaving ?
i slid ivy &apos;s daylight ring under your front door .
no ! i don &apos;t care about some stupid ring , stefan .
were you seriously about to dump
your vampire ex @-@ girlfriend onto my lap
and then just skip town ?
god , who are you right now ?
i &apos;m someone who &apos;s trying to start over ,
and then suddenly , you and enzo show up ,
and now i have hunters on my trail
and a brand @-@ new vampire who wants to kill me
and everyone else in her path ,
and that &apos;s not how someone starts of , caroline .
you know what the worst part about all of this is ?
is about a month ago , i wished that damon would come back
because i knew if that happened
that i &apos;d get you back , too ,
but right now , all i want is for you
to just get back in your car and go .
where are you ?
i did a really bad thing .
oh , you mean , break my neck ? yeah . i noticed .
ok . two bad things . look . i &apos;m sorry .
tell me exactly where you are and stay put ,
and i &apos;ll come get you .
can you stop and let me concentrate ?
on the bright side ,
this stuff &apos;s not so bad .
it &apos;s fruity and fizzy .
damon , i &apos;m working on something .
on the not so bright side is your intelligence
because you took the only chance
of us getting out of here and turned him into a giant ...
douchekabob .
think about it , damon .
what prison gives an inmate a key ?
is that a trick question ,
or is this stuff actually starting to kick in ?
i think the gemini coven used a bennett spell to create this place .
what if that &apos;s why my grams sent me here ?
this is the face i make when i don &apos;t understand you .
you know , the last thing my grams said to me was to stay strong .
what if that was her way of telling me
i have the power to get out ?
i have the ascendant ,
a massive celestial event to draw from ,
plus a burning desire to get away from you .
that &apos;s why kai wouldn &apos;t kill me .
he needed a bennett .
i was his only way out of here .
whoa . where are you going ?
home .
you coming ?
what happened ?
i hit this kid in the road .
it wasn &apos;t my fault .
it was an accident .
yeah , but that &apos;s a good thing , right ?
you know what i mean .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
if he dies , i &apos;m ...
call elena .
ambulances are on the way .
good . get over here . i need your hands .
ok .
put your fingers right here .
that should stop the bleeding .
i can look at the rest of him .
are you doing ok ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
just keep your finger on that femoral artery .
ok .
his pulse is still dropping .
this isn &apos;t your first rodeo ?
enlisted in the army right out of med school .
family stuff . just had to get away .
dr. laughlin , my friend tyler , he &apos;s in trouble ,
and its sounds really bad ,
and i don &apos;t know where he is .
call me jo . put him on speaker .
ok .
tyler , can you hear me ?
i don &apos;t know what to do .
i think he &apos;s losing consciousness .
need you to answer my questions as accurately as you can .
is there blood ?
tons .
is it still flowing ? is he bleeding now ?
no . i -- it looks like it stopped .
is there any coming out of his nose or his mouth ?
yes .
what color is it ?
is it red , or is it black ?
it &apos;s black .
it &apos;s really freaking black .
what do we do ?
take his hand .
now what ?
just try and keep him comfortable .
won &apos;t be long now .
it &apos;s time , damon .
all right . let &apos;s get awkward .
like this ?
yep .
i &apos;m sure there are about a billion people you &apos;re rather be here with .
not exactly .
let &apos;s go -- ohh !
forgetting someone ?
did you really think i hadn &apos;t tried to kill myself before ?
because i had , lots of times ,
lots of ways .
grab that , and the next arrow goes in her heart .
your choice .
i got you .
no ! ohh !
damon ! no !
come on , come on , come on . you &apos;ve got to live .
come on , man . you can &apos;t die !
stop ! tyler , stop !
just stop , ok ?
there &apos;s nothing you can do .
i killed him .
no , you didn &apos;t .
yes , i did , liv .
everything we &apos;ve tried to do to keep me from this ,
and all it took was one guy running out into the road .
what are you doing ?
liv , liv , stop !
what the hell are you doing ?
you didn &apos;t kill him , tyler .
i did .
hey . the ambulances have arrived .
jo said to let the paramedics take it from here .
i don &apos;t think she can wait .
her windpipe , it &apos;s--
deviated is the medical term .
screwed is more like it .
either way , she &apos;s not getting enough air .
liam , i can help .
good . stabilize her head while i trache her .
have you ever done this before ?
practiced on a grapefruit . didn &apos;t end well .
no , liam . that &apos;s not what i meant .
i can actually ...
it worked .
you actually did it .
don &apos;t sound so surprised .
bonnie , get out of here .
i &apos;m not gonna make it .
but you are . motus .
don &apos;t !
no .
no !
how you feeling ?
you really want to know ?
because i &apos;m hopped up on pain meds
and just obnoxious enough to tell you .
i &apos;ll take my chances .
i think you &apos;re great .
you &apos;re brave , funny ,
not to mention maybe the most attractive man i &apos;ve ever seen ,
and i feel completely comfortable telling you this
because i &apos;m old enough to know what i want .
and call me crazy , but i think i was meant to know you .
this is the part where you say something
or kiss me
or run for the hills .
yeah .
i think you &apos;re amazing ,
brilliant ,
and one of the sexiest women i have ever met ,
and i would love to believe that you and i
were meant to be
because i would love to believe there was a plan for me
other than this life that i am living right now .
but tonight was a disaster .
you thought i was boring
and a borderline alcoholic ,
and because you don &apos;t know me ,
not the real me anyway ,
you don &apos;t want to kiss me ,
and you absolutely want me to run for the hills .
you &apos;re right .
tonight was a literal disaster ,
and you &apos;re definitely an alcoholic ...
but you &apos;re far from boring , ric .
where are you ? i have been standing here for a hundred years .
don &apos;t exaggerate .
i &apos;m almost there .
need any help ?
i heard about the , uh , big campus accident on my scanner .
i heard someone got hurt or something .
i &apos;m fine .
actually , you &apos;re bleeding .
you might be in shock .
please just go .
i don &apos;t think--
come here .
ok .
so that girl dressed like lady whitmore ,
i was ready to give up on her ,
and you were able to save her . how ?
i don &apos;t know . beginner &apos;s luck ?
elena , she should have died .
and she didn &apos;t .
there are crazy , mysterious things in the world ,
i mean , some things science can &apos;t explain .
name one .
ok . um ...
why does a baby take its first breath ?
a reflex . the fluid in a newborn &apos;s lungs are--
i thought kissing me was a fate worse then death .
you asked me what my type is .
you were a hero tonight ,
an absolutely jaw @-@ dropping and out @-@ of @-@ this @-@ world hero .
that &apos;s my type .
we &apos;re closed .
i talked to elena .
still closed .
she said everyone else lived .
you don &apos;t want to talk about what happened ?
i &apos;ve got nothing to say .
you killed someone tonight .
you can &apos;t just pretend that didn &apos;t happen .
watch me .
liv .
liv .
he was dead .
there was nothing you could have done to save him ,
so you saved me instead .
you saved me .
i can never repay you for that .
all i can do is promise you
that i won &apos;t waste it .
yep .
this is happenning .
i &apos;m gonna talk out loud to a ...
a crypt filled with my dead family .
everyone but you , damon .
because wherever you are ,
it &apos;s not here .
i got to say ...
i &apos;m not doing so great without you .
i keep trying to start over ,
but ...
i can &apos;t get anywhere ...
because i &apos;m lost , brother .
i &apos;m lost .
so what ? gone a couple of months ,
you think it &apos;s ok to waste a perfectly good bottle of bourbon ?
damon ?
yep .
in the flesh .
how can i see you right now ?
because i &apos;m not dead , stefan .
i mean , this stuff &apos;s good , but it &apos;s not
&quot; i see dead people &quot; good .
it &apos;s a hell of a long story , brother ,
but i &apos;m back .
i &apos;m back .
yeah .
i &apos;m back .
