marge , baby , i &apos;m out the door .

because sometimes people say they &apos;re out the door
when they really haven &apos;t left yet .
those people are horrible , horrible liars .

simpson , not so fast .
小心驶得万年船
hold up one end of this poster .
now use it to conceal this .
excellent .
now , let me just crank up the plumb bob
to determine the vertical .
with this mechanical marvel ,
we &apos;ll have this poster level in under three hours .
ooh , and for a little excitement ,
how about a plumb bob song ?
all right . um ...
* one must never , never *
* never rush *
* the plumb bob *
* slow is the way *
* the only way to go *
* clear your schedule *
* before you use the plumb bob *
* yes , the plumb bob *
* is mighty , mighty *
* mighty *
* slow *
maggie &apos;s had her bath ,
dinner &apos;s on the stove .
dare i pop a cork ?
give me a spin , marge . you &apos;re so deft .
not like ... him .
mom . mom !
my costume for the science play is all wrong !
you said you were a seahorse .
a male seahorse .
with a pouch .
males have pouches ?
male seahorse &apos;s nurturing is one of the wonders of the world .
you said you read the script .
bart gave me a synopsis .
oh , boy .
oh , now what ?
eat your carrot and pea medley .
mom , i &apos;ll clean that up for you .
oh , thank god , some help .
where &apos;s the mop ?
in the mop closet .
where &apos;s the bucket ?
under the mop .
other closet .
there &apos;s stuff in front of it .
let me help .
hey , there &apos;s wood underneath this linoleum .
oh ! just go play outside .
outside ? your loss .
只准单身荷兰人进入
i do not get what kids see in these places .
it &apos;s the genie of the sub .
genie ? i wish .
you get a lamp and a carpet ,
which is more than i &apos;ve got in here .
hmm , didn &apos;t know this place was filled with such losers .
hey , martin .
bartholomew !
this playground has safely stimulated my imagination .
what the hell are you talking about ?
martin .
who &apos;s your new friend ?
mother , don &apos;t blow this for me .
fine , i &apos;ll just go sit and talk to his mother .
where is she ?
i &apos;m here by myself .
but i have a safety number .
moe &apos;s tavern . homer ain &apos;t here .
and for once , that &apos;s the truth .
simpson , are you here unsupervised ?
yeah . and so what ?
i &apos;d lose the attitude , &quot; sylvester alone . &quot;
finally , a laugh out of lou .
son , kids aren &apos;t allowed on their own anymore .
now , who said you could come here ?
my mom .
always the mom .
she &apos;s got needles .
what did bart do now ?
i was playing nicely in the park .
bart , how could you ... what ?
your children need to be supervised .
take her away , boys .
if you take me away , then who &apos;s gonna watch my kids ?
you should &apos;ve thought of that
before we showed up unannounced .
what , marge ?
you &apos;re being arrested ?
i &apos;m afraid so , mr. simpson .
a mother at the park saw something she disapproved of .
and luckily for your son , she overreacted .
i , uh ... i get carsick in the front .
our top story , a springfield mother
has been arrested for an outrageous &quot; negligée . &quot;
the ...
sorry , i &apos;m being told it &apos;s negligence .
which is very boring .
judge , i don &apos;t understand .
when i was a kid , we used to go out and play
and not come home until dark .
i see .
bailiff , incarcerate marge simpsons &apos; mother .
thanks for ratting me out , marge
with all due respect , judge ,
this is wackadoodle .
nobody cares about their kids more than i do .
liar .
marge is right , your honor .
my e @-@ mail password is &quot; bad dad . &quot;
yeah , judge .
if you want to know who should be in jail ,
he weighs 240 and smells like onions .
it is not within the purview of this court
to determine how fat and smelly your father may be .
mrs. simpsons , 90 days .
this is kafkaesque .
kafkaesque !
i &apos;ve got my eye on you .
now it &apos;s orwellian .
我们的无期徒刑又多了四年
hey , kitties .
you got a new ball of yarn .
oh , that guard is awfully slammy .
newbies on top .
oh . where &apos;s the ladder ?
have you been claimed yet ?
claimed ?
by one of the book clubs .
yeah , we read a little , dig a little ,
read a little , dig a little ,
kiss a little , dig a little .
homer , i think you &apos;re supposed to cook sausage .
what &apos;s the point ?
well , hi there , homer .
i know a time like this is when a man really needs his neighbor .
yeah , well , thanks for the check @-@ in .
well , this is more than a check @-@ in .
it &apos;s a chance to do good for us boys in the hood !
just call us nwa ,
&quot; neighbors with appetizers . &quot;
i really am the richest man in town .
not rich in money ,
but in what really matters : pity .
and what happened to marge is a wake up call for us all .
there &apos;s no greater crime than half @-@ assed parenting .
kirk , where &apos;s milhouse ?
on the leash , baby . on the leash .
he &apos;s too far .
retract . retract !
why &apos;d you pull me back ?
some new kids were just about to give me a chance .
don &apos;t try anything new , son .
i could &apos;ve married a woman who didn &apos;t look exactly like me .
but that would &apos;ve been crazy .
hey , newbie .
nobody touches the new james patterson
until solar reads it first .
she wants you to pick it up .
you scared , huh ?
anybody else want a taste of blue thunder ?
uh , i do . yeah .
now , if you ladies recall what this place
is supposed to be for ...
smokin &apos; weed ?
reading !
dad , if this is what they send
when mom goes to jail ,
just imagine what happens when you kick the bucket .
oh , man , that &apos;s gonna be so awesome .
dad , dad ! you &apos;re eating a teddy bear !
that &apos;s my stomach &apos;s problem .
okay , homer , i just changed all the linens ,
diapered the dog for modesty ,
and replaced the batteries in the smoke detectors ,
which were all bad .
one was just a candy dish with a red light painted on .
was there any candy in it ?
there is now .
oh , flanders .
it turns out there &apos;s a good side to you after all .
well , sir , maybe i know a little bit about what it &apos;s like
to lose the lady of the house .
oh , i think i heard a dryer ding .
thank you , mr. flanders .
tell your boys i want to hang .
flanders is great .
i &apos;ve always said that .
but we can &apos;t forget your mother .
oh , my first prison flower .
can it be ? am i starting to like it in here ?
exercise time !
i never have time to exercise .
is this a prison or a spa ?
it &apos;s a prison .
hey , uh , are there any more chocolate chip muffins ?
sorry , dad . the only ones left have caraway seeds .
oh . i miss your mother so much .
shockingly , these gift baskets
haven &apos;t solved anything .
wait , dad . that one that looks like blueberry
actually has m &amp; m &apos;s .
oh . oh , thank god . everything &apos;s okay .
but for how long ?
mom , i really , really miss you .
also , i have a field trip form
that needs to be signed for school .
i think if i mail it to you at the prison
it &apos;s still easier than getting it from dad .
i want to talk to mom .
can you send me a shiv for show and tell ?
preferably with blood on it .
hey , give me the phone .
are my blue pants done at the prison laundry ?
remember to sign my form .
shiv with blood .
press my pants .
the electric chair .
and then he thought it was the electric chair .
8 : 00 . lights out .
really ? 8 : 00 ? i get to go to bed ?
i don &apos;t have to clean a sink full of dishes ,
or write a paragraph
with topic sentence for homer ?
aw , you &apos;re tired too .
everyone goes to sleep so easily here .
marge , your positivity is contagious .
i &apos;m starting to believe i really will show everyone .
simpson , you got a visitor .
oh , gee , now ? it &apos;s a shame to go inside .
okay , let &apos;s move in the body now .
marge , i got great news .
we hired the one good lawyer in town .
yes , mrs. simpson , i got you off on a technicality .
since your husband never filed for a birth certificate ,
bart isn &apos;t legally your son .
how about that ?
why aren &apos;t you saying anything , marge ?
you &apos;re free . free .
now , it &apos;s not the world you remember .
the girl at the coffee place that left ?
came back .
so you &apos;ll have that to get used to .
i &apos;m free ?
oh , and just in time .
bart &apos;s claiming he &apos;s in another dimension ,
but i think he &apos;s just hiding in the closet .
i had 90 days .
i was promised 90 days .
now you have to give me more time .
oh , you don &apos;t .
i can &apos;t go to another school meeting .
i can &apos;t !
everyone just asks about their own kid .
hey , you like shopping ?
&apos;cause you just bought yourself two more months .
sorry , homie . i can &apos;t go back yet .
just tell me where the soap for the dishwasher goes
and how do i ...
marge would rather stay in prison than come home to me .
i have to reexamine my entire life .
yeah , maybe you can start by not bringing your kids to the bar .
yeah , it &apos;s kind of funny-- homer takes his kids to a saloon ,
but marge is in jail for being a bad parent .
i guess somebody up there likes me .
do you like him ?
uh , not really , no .
i &apos;ve got to change , show marge i can help around the house .
more than just turning up the tv when she vacuums .
i &apos;ve got to become the perfect homemaker .
oh , i was doing so great ,
but it turned out i was a secret alcoholic .
yeah , good thing it &apos;s just your imagination .
oh , yeah .
when we said we &apos;d take turns watching all the kids ,
i never thought it would be my turn .
why did i get the choke chain ?
go around this side of the tree .
this side of the tree . this side of the tree !
no , ralph . no !
hi , mr. bobcat .
you &apos;re in charge , boy .
now , listen , bobcat .
are you as sick as i am of having grown @-@ ups
everywhere you go ?
i say we sneak off to the park and have fun by ourselves .
great idea . i &apos;ll text my mom .
my jitterbug senior phone !
jitterbug call center .
if you &apos;ve fallen and need assistance , press one .
if you &apos;re lonely and want to talk , press disconnect .
oh , i really miss my family .
i thought they were letting you out .
i just wasn &apos;t ready for the outside .
i didn &apos;t realize how much i needed a break .
but maybe not a prison break .
prison break ? prison break ! yeah !
all right , all our parents
think we &apos;re playing after @-@ school rugby with willie .
what ... where &apos;s me scrum ?
time for unsupervised play !
i &apos;m going down the hot slide in shorts .
i &apos;m gonna freckle .
i &apos;m gonna ride the hobbyhorse english style .
finally-- kids having fun the way they were meant to .
it just proves that danger is not the rule ,
but the exception .
tornado !
this is kent brockman covering two of the biggest stories
of the year : a tornado and a prison break ,
while i report safely from the channel six emmy watch bunker .
arnie pye , what &apos;s the situation ?
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m about to die , kent .
and worst of all is the fact that your voice
is the last one i &apos;ll ever hear ,
you pompous snow monkey !
homer , what are you doing here ?
i had to do whatever it takes to get you to leave .
so i dressed up as a prison guard .
now i &apos;d better not blow my cover .
get back . get back .
okay , a little forward .
now back ! back ! back !
now forward .
and back ! back ! back !
it &apos;s very sweet that you came for me .
i know things won &apos;t always be perfect-- --
but they &apos;ll be better than fighting off prison inmates
in a tornado .
i believe you .
and i want to go home .
come on , man . take the shot .
no , i can &apos;t . i &apos;ll fire a warning shot at her hair .
oh , she uses too much product .
don &apos;t worry . all the kids are accounted for
except for , uh ... raife waggum .
well , i have a sad call to make .
huh . busy .
bart , would you like some extra bacon ?
sure would , mom .
okay , but you owe me .
sorry , sorry , force of habit .
it &apos;s okay , mom . whatever you want , just glad you &apos;re back .
geez , ever since i got sprung from the hoosegow ,
you kids have been kind of clingy .
no , mom , we &apos;re just really glad to have you back .
and we &apos;re not nuts or anything ,
but please don &apos;t let the refrigerator door block my view of you .
hmm , i need some spices from the pantry .
i &apos;m coming , too .
oh , you &apos;re pathetic .
let me in .
now , kids , give your mother a little peace and ...
i want to say two things :
i love you guys and we &apos;re out of peanut butter .
