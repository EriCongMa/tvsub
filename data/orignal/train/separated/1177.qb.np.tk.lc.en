for us making it to senior year .
not all of us made it .
can you see , or not ?
no .
the surgery didn &apos;t ...
no , it didn &apos;t .
garrett reynolds , you &apos;re under arrest .
for what ?
the murder of alison dilaurentis .
is miss rivers available ?
how did you get my number ?
hey . everything okay ?
i need a lawyer ,
and your mom &apos;s one of the best in the state .
i &apos;m not going to help you .
i think i remember leaving your house ,
and the next thing i know , i &apos;m here .
you guys , this is a set @-@ up . it &apos;s not &quot; a. &quot;
mona is drooling in her bed at a nut hospital .
we don &apos;t know that for sure .
i &apos;ve been visiting her .
what ? !
&quot; mona played with dolls-- i play with body parts . &quot;
&quot; game on , bitches . &quot;
&quot; a. &quot;
the author goes to great lengths to establish hedda gabler
as a strong , proud woman ,
someone who could never live
with the threat of being blackmailed .
but hedda was pushed to take a desperate action .
and while she may have seen it as brave ,
we see it as tragic .
what might really be tragic
is if some of you don &apos;t start taking some notes .
sorry . senior year is not all about skipping classes
and dancing for the security cameras at walmart .
that &apos;s what your weekends are for .
you might also want to research some of his other plays
and see how they were received at that time ...
emily , is everything all right ?
c @-@ can i be excused ?
emily--
what &apos;s going on ?
no , no . just come on .
em , what &apos;s the matter ? talk to us .
what is that ?
are those teeth ?
please just get rid of it .
are they alison &apos;s ?
my god , i can &apos;t breathe .
it wasn &apos;t enough to steal her bones ,
now we &apos;re gonna get pieces of her delivered to us ?
guys , these probably aren &apos;t even human .
they &apos;re totally human !
how do you know ?
because i worked at a dentist &apos;s office spencer .
for two days , answering phones .
yeah , and there were teeth everywhere .
even the friggin &apos; bathroom key was shaped like a cuspid .
guys , real or not ,
this &quot; a &quot; is working overtime to frame us .
first the call to emily from spencer &apos;s phone ,
then the cemetery photo , and now ...
it &apos;s all my fault .
em , stop .
no . that whole night is like a black hole .
i still can &apos;t figure out how i got to ali &apos;s grave .
we need to give this to the police .
we can &apos;t . we already lied to them about the lake house .
yeah . that was a huge mistake .
we keep digging ourselves in deeper .
burning those photos was one thing--
these are teeth . okay ?
we should at least tell our parents .
tell them what ?
we have no idea what this &quot; a &quot; knows .
are you ready to explain
every lie we &apos;ve ever told since ali died ?
you don &apos;t have to protect me , okay ?
i can take the blame for all of this .
emily , stop .
you &apos;re not in this by yourself .
yeah , but you know what , if you could remember something else
from that black hole besides an old car ,
that &apos;d be nice .
hanna .
i &apos;m just saying , it &apos;d be helpful .
ok , can we please just get rid of that ?
we can &apos;t toss this . this is evidence .
look . i &apos;ll put it in my locker until we figure out what to do .
like your locker is safe from &quot; a &quot; ?
just give it to me .
i &apos;ll put it in my purse--
hanna .
look . i will get it .
no , wait !
you can &apos;t just dive in there .
these things have sensors .
excuse me ?
you just have to be really careful .
well , if you would like to ...
no .
i can &apos;t believe that we lost it .
it wasn &apos;t like we were gonna hand it over to the cops .
i wanted to .
we could have found out who sent it to us .
there were fingerprints on that necklace .
yeah , mine .
hanna , you have to go back to radley .
what ?
you need to make mona talk .
spencer &apos;s right .
mona has never been working alone ,
and she &apos;s probably still giving people orders .
find out who else has seen her .
you know what ? you guys just ripped me a new one
last week for visiting her .
now you want me to go back there with cupcakes ?
if we want answers , maybe we should be focusing on garrett .
i will go back to garrett ,
if you will work on mona .
will you go today ? after school ?
has anyone spoken to her since school started ?
no . i still think it &apos;s really shady
that she didn &apos;t get back the first day of school .
it &apos;s no shadier than lucas strolling around
on saturday at four in the morning .
well , maybe that &apos;s their witching hour .
wait ! so now we think they &apos;re definitely connected ?
jenna and lucas ?
em , you saw them talking back to
black swan person at the masquerade party .
mona could have an entire outfield playing for her .
hey , watch it .
here you go , man .
that &apos;s okay , jenna , .
don &apos;t worry about it.- is it just me ,
or she is blinder than she was last year ?
hey . still working on this ?
yeah , but i can fix it .
the school should be paying you .
a lot .
what &apos;s up ? you okay ?
um , i do have to meet my mom after school .
she wants me to help pick out an outfit
for this bank thingie ,
so can we do dinner tomorrow night instead ?
yeah . tomorrow night &apos;s fine .
great . well , see you later , sweetie .
your mom thinks i &apos;m a basket case .
my mom loves you , em .
she knows everything that you &apos;ve been through .
can she spread the love around the faculty lounge ?
i have to take four make @-@ up exams
or they &apos;re gonna make me repeat eleventh grade .
they can &apos;t hold you back .
yes , they can .
i was absent all of april .
you &apos;re gonna get through this .
maybe .
you just need a study partner . a tutor .
wait ! why don &apos;t you just call ezra ?
if your first make @-@ up test is english , he could be your tutor .
awkward .
no , it &apos;s not .
aria , i can &apos;t think of him as &quot; mr. fitz &quot; anymore .
okay ? i &apos;ve seen his underwear drawer .
those were his socks .
why would his socks have a flap in the middle ?
i &apos;m texting you his number .
aria , i don &apos;t--
he &apos;s not teaching right now , and it &apos;s killing him .
seriously , you &apos;d be helping each other out .
who is that ?
meredith .
wait . that &apos;s your dad &apos;s meredith ?
that &apos;s the skank you and ali caught lip @-@ locking in the car ?
if my mom sees her here ... what &apos;s she doing here ?
excuse me .
are you looking for someone ?
hello , aria . i forgot you were still a student here .
yeah , i am . what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m applying for an open teaching position .
oh , don &apos;t worry , hon . i won &apos;t put you down as a reference .
i don &apos;t get it .
why would she want to work at a school
where she &apos;s gonna bump into my mother every single day ?
and why should my mom have to go through this ?
she &apos;s been divorced for , like , 20 minutes .
aria , breathe . meredith applied for the job ,
it doesn &apos;t mean she got it .
there &apos;s no reason to tell your mom .
seriously , though , who is giving that woman a reference--my dad ?
ooh , yeah , i wouldn &apos;t tell him either .
why ? you think he has something to do with this ?
i didn &apos;t say that , i just think you &apos;re still
walking on bit of scorched earth when it comes to us ,
and if you put him on the defensive--
he &apos;s not in that place anymore .
then why am i dropping you off three blocks from your house ?
because he &apos;s still in that place .
i hate this . i hate having to sneak around
and avoid saying your name ...
it &apos;s like we &apos;re going backwards .
one battle at a time .
we just had a nice dinner-- with your mom . okay ?
let &apos;s celebrate what is working .
it &apos;s emily . has she called you yet ?
no .
why haven &apos;t you called ezra yet ?
call him now . he &apos;s free .
emily &apos;s gonna be calling you .
i might not answer .
ezra , she &apos;s sinking .
please ?
so , um ...
did you talk to your mom ?
no .
i need you to give me a better reason .
other than being innocent ?
look , you said you knew who dug up ali &apos;s grave .
how do i know that the person didn &apos;t just do that for you ?
i didn &apos;t touch your friend maya , and i didn &apos;t kill alison ,
and guess what , what was snatched from her grave that night
would have actually proved it .
how ?
is your mom defending me or not ?
why would she or anyone
else in this town believe that you &apos;re innocent ?
spencer ,
somebody you know well has you completely fooled .
people lie , but ...
medical records don &apos;t .
whose medical records ?
who are you talking about ? alison ?
jenna &apos;s ?
wait .
are you talking about jenna ?
so it turns out that ...
takes that frizzy @-@ haired girl who dates the quarterback .
you know , the one who transferred from ohio ?
well , noel kahn thinks this dude is a genius
because he can burp the star @-@ spangled banner .
have you ... heard from noel ?
does he ever come visit you ?
has anyone ... been to visit you besides me ?
you know what , mona ? if i told the police
that you mowed me down with your car ,
you would not be here getting a
slice of peach pie every day to wash down your meds .
you &apos;d be sharing a jail cell with someone calling you &quot; peach pie &quot;
while you braid her back hair !
god , mona , you owe me !
all right ? you have made my life a nightmare ! you owe me !
what &apos;s going on ?
this visit &apos;s over . now .
hey there .
can i get you a cup of coffee ?
no , i &apos;m okay . thanks , mr . fitz .
you can call me ezra .
no , i can &apos;t .
but i can try .
have a seat .
so ... aria mentioned
you &apos;re taking the english make @-@ up exam this thursday .
yeah , and then chem and history next week ,
and spanish after that .
great . well , i &apos;m glad we can
start with a language i actually speak ... in .
but not always so well . did you like the novel ?
yeah , it was okay .
ending was kind of sad .
emily , um ...
i &apos;m so sorry about maya .
we don &apos;t have to talk about that .
no . i know .
but it &apos;s just , i-- i wanted you to know that .
i &apos;m just ... sorry .
your friend mona deserves to be drawn and quartered .
and given what she &apos;s done , i understand you want to punish her .
that &apos;s not why i came here .
i just lost it .
i &apos;ve done worse .
i once threw a bowl of soup
across the room when visiting my dad .
in a place much like this . worse .
your dad was in the nut house ?
for years .
he checked out of my life when i was ten ,
traded our family room for the chaos inside his head .
he made your friend down the hall seem downright chatty .
she won &apos;t even apologize .
then you have to accept that , hanna .
you &apos;ve lost someone whom you trusted .
and then you might be grieving for the mona
you didn &apos;t know as much as for the one you did .
i &apos;m getting really tired of losing people .
and this is particularly
hard because mona &apos;s right in front of you .
in clinical terms , we call it &quot; ambiguous loss . &quot;
what ?
there &apos;s been a death , but it doesn &apos;t involve a body .
like when a soldier goes missing ,
or a relative slips into dementia .
they &apos;re gone , but yet , still here .
here .
where did jenna go when music camp ended ?
did your parents pick her up ?
i have no idea . why ?
well , that camp ended on august 23rd .
i looked it up online .
did she just stay up in the poconos ?
honestly , i don &apos;t know .
i was packing up my stuff before she even went to camp .
just eating breakfast there was weird .
how come ?
my parents were treating jenna like one of her snow @-@ globes .
after the surgery didn &apos;t work ,
it was like they thought
she &apos;d crack if they asked the wrong question .
come here .
you &apos;re a little tense .
yeah . i was born that way .
maybe i can help .
spencer ?
yeah ! in here !
hello , toby .
hey , mrs. hastings ,
how &apos;s it goin &apos; ?
i &apos;ve had better days .
did your sister call ? i &apos;ve left three messages for her .
uh , no , is melissa okay ?
i don &apos;t think &quot; okay &quot; really applies in her situation , does it ?
will you be joining us for dinner , toby ?
uh ... well , i was--
sure .
it was weird , but we got past it .
so you &apos;re calling him &quot; ezra &quot; or &quot; mr. fitz &quot; ?
neither . it &apos;s a lot easier not to call him anything .
oh . that &apos;s what your dad does , right , aria ?
just about .
this whole &quot; don &apos;t ask , don &apos;t tell &quot; thing is not working .
i did that with my mom forever .
but she finally came around .
by the time i brought samara over ,
they were bonding over arts and crafts .
i don &apos;t think my dad is gonna be scrapbookin &apos; with ezra anytime soon .
what &apos;s that ?
is that yours ?
what &apos;s going on ? whose is that ?
do you want to save your parents &apos; marriage , or not ?
i don &apos;t even know what we &apos;re looking for .
if my dad said that meredith &apos;s history , i believe him .
oh , grow up . they probably do it on that couch . daily .
do you smell cheap perfume ?
ali , there are other students that come in here , okay ?
yeah , and how many of them like to roll around and sweat on his couch ?
is that someone coming ?
which student does this belong to ?
you found that in his couch ?
honey , i &apos;m sure she &apos;s shed a lot more than that .
probably find her panties in the mini @-@ fridge .
oh . so they have been spending quality time together .
i hear break @-@ up sex is the best .
why would he lie ? he told me that he ended it .
maybe he did , sweetie . but people make up .
they backslide .
aria , if you really want to get rid of this bitch ,
you &apos;re gonna have to help daddy figure out what she really is--
a vindictive , homewrecking bunny @-@ boiler .
don &apos;t look now , but mere @-@ death is having a meltdown .
蠢猪
how come you never told us about that ?
why would i ?
i felt like complete crap by the time i got home ,
and i made alison promise to never tell a soul .
so why is it in your locker ?
you &apos;ve been hiding it this whole time ?
no . no . it &apos;s just that you guys ...
don &apos;t you remember when ali &apos;s mom called us before her funeral
and she asked all of us if we each wanted to put something ....
a keepsake in her casket ?
and that &apos;s what you put in there ?
so real teeth or not ,
that was definitely stolen from ali &apos;s grave .
so next , cite an example of the author uses symbolism .
emily ?
i &apos;m sorry , what was the question ?
wharton &apos;s use of symbolism ?
the cat .
from the broken dish .
emily ...
you know this material ,
and you &apos;ve been in high @-@ pressure situations before .
when you were swimming , you thrived on them , right ?
so how did you prepare for a race ?
what did you do minutes before you jumped in that pool ?
um , i ... listened to music .
then that &apos;s what you &apos;ll do before you take these exams .
everything you need to know is already in your head .
你过来吗 -以斯拉
aria ? is that you ?
jenna .
i thought i recognized the ringtone .
i was going to call you tonight .
why ?
i lost my accompanist for next week &apos;s assembly ,
and i thought of asking you to play with me .
i &apos;m a little rusty .
oh , it &apos;s an easy piece .
just a couple of rehearsals and we &apos;d be good to go .
so you want to come over tomorrow ?
i &apos;d really love to , jenna ,
but i &apos;m helping my dad with this project he &apos;s doing , and--
he &apos;s actually waving at me
from across the street , so i really gotta go .
she invited you to that house ?
what &apos;d you say ?
i said no freaking way . to myself .
but to her i just said that i was busy .
did you ever find a note ?
are we sure that earring came from &quot; a &quot; ?
i &apos;d be a lot more sure
if you could squeeze something out of mona .
please tell me that you &apos;re going back there , han .
are you ?
uh , i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ll call you back .
hey . took long enough .
they messed up . gave our order to someone else .
didn &apos;t you get my text ?
uh , no . i was on the phone with aria .
i &apos;m starving .
me too .
you got somewhere else you need to be ?
no . no .
of course not .
ask whoever that is to call you back , please .
i-- i won &apos;t answer it .
everything okay ?
no . clearly it &apos;s not if my
daughter &apos;s making secret trips to the county jail .
there &apos;s still a lot of things that i don &apos;t understand .
yeah , me too , like why would you have anything to do with
a man who &apos;s accused of murdering two teenage girls ?
mom , emily is really hurting ,
and i just wanted some answers .
did this happen to maya because she knew too much ?
did the d.a. &apos; s office send you there to ask that question ?
i didn &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m guessing it &apos;ll be answered at his trial .
why are you talking to me like
i &apos;m a hostile witness ?
maya was my friend , too .
this is a dangerous man , spencer .
he wouldn &apos;t be locked up if
there weren &apos;t damaging evidence against him .
don &apos;t you ever go there again .
so is rosewood safe now
that one dangerous man is locked up ?
because garret was already in jail when ali &apos;s grave was dug up .
if you &apos;re implying that he &apos;s got helpful friends on the outside ,
that &apos;s even more of a reason not to see him .
people might think that &apos;s you .
don &apos;t you ever go there again .
am i clear ?
i thought you were starved .
guess i &apos;m not .
okay , where do you need to be right now ?
hanna , we stopped lying to each other a long time ago ,
didn &apos;t we ?
i was thinking of visiting mona at radley .
why now ? just curious .
it &apos;s complicated .
no , it &apos;s more than complicated . it is completely whacked .
look , she is my best friend in tenth grade .
yeah , and she threw you a few poisoned apples in the eleventh .
i don &apos;t expect you to understand , all right ? i know you hate her .
i feel sorry for her , okay ?
but not enough to send her a get well card .
caleb-- i don &apos;t care if she
spends the rest of her life in a paper gown
making ash trays and pooping in a stall without a door
as long as she can &apos;t get anywhere near you , or hurt you--
it hurt me to see her like this , okay ?
i &apos;m having an ambiguous loss .
you &apos;re what ?
that &apos;s what it &apos;s called . someone dies but they &apos;re still here .
where did you pick that up ?
i googled it , okay ?
i &apos;m not gonna have this fight .
fine . i &apos;ll go with you .
what ?
to radley .
i &apos;ll drive you there .
by the time we get there visiting hours will be over .
then we &apos;ll go tomorrow .
why would you do that ?
because i love you .
and i don &apos;t want us sneaking around each other .
否则我就派人去告诉警察 晚安 -a
dad ?
can i talk to you ?
yeah . what &apos;s wrong ?
will you sit down ? i-- i need to tell you something .
i know that your office was trashed a couple years ago .
and i know that i &apos;m not supposed to know that
because you thought that it was meredith who did it .
but it wasn &apos;t her , it was me .
why are you telling me this now ?
did seeing meredith yesterday bring this on ?
i guess . maybe .
do you have any idea how close i came to calling the police ?
i thought she wanted to hurt my family .
she already had .
so i did it .
i said a lot of harsh things to her at the time .
and now you &apos;re telling me that i accused her of something that ...
you did .
we both owe her an apology .
and i &apos;m not doing that for you .
you ready ?
okay , guys , you have 45 minutes .
i &apos;ll give you a five @-@ minute warning before i collect the tests .
good luck .
so ... this won &apos;t be long .
if you need me , i &apos;ll be right here , okay ?
hey , mona .
i &apos;m back .
i didn &apos;t come here to throw any more chairs .
i just ...
wanted to return the favor .
i brought the good stuff .
how did you get your hands on these ?
nobody was home . i found them in jenna &apos;s bathroom .
so what are they ? they &apos;re eye drops ?
the doctor prescribed the first bottle to jenna
last spring after the surgery .
so ?
thank you .
thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
check out the expiration date on the other bottle .
if the surgery didn &apos;t work ,
why is she still renewing that prescription ?
wait . what are you saying ? you think jenna can see ?
emily ?
are you okay ?
five minutes , guys .
okay , time is up .
emily ... it &apos;s not a take @-@ home test .
oh , right . sorry .
did you need more time ?
no , i &apos;m done .
emily , wait .
did you study for this ?
yeah , i did . but i--
i did the best i could . i really have to go .
hello .
hi .
do you want to sit ?
i &apos;d ... really rather not do this here , if that &apos;s okay .
well , here is where we are .
sit .
look , i-- i know that this is ancient history ,
but i just needed to clarify something .
after i found out about you and my dad , i was really upset .
and i broke into his office--
you don &apos;t have to recount all the gory details .
i spoke to your father this morning .
i remember his threats on my voicemail like it was yesterday .
right .
well , i &apos;m sorry .
thank you .
maybe i &apos;ll hear that from your father tomorrow , too .
you &apos;re seeing him ?
we made lunch plans .
and i guess i have you to thank for that .
is there something else you want to say ?
yeah .
i didn &apos;t go to his office with the intention of stealing anything ,
i just took the earrings because--
wait .
go back . earrings ?
i don &apos;t have the other one ,
but as soon as i find it i &apos;ll make sure that you get it .
what made you think this belonged to me ?
that &apos;s not my earring .
can i help you ?
yeah , i &apos;m just here to visit garrett reynolds .
he &apos;s meeting with his lawyer . it could be a while .
oh . may i wait ?
suit yourself .
thank you .
can you give me a list of all previous visitors , please ?
thanks .
no , no , no . i want something compiled for the last five months .
i &apos;ll need a little time to put that together .
okay . tomorrow ?
yeah , tomorrow works .
okay , thanks .
pardon me . you &apos;re with hanna ?
i &apos;m dr. kingston . hanna knows me as wren .
and you are ?
caleb .
her boyfriend .
very good . so you decided to join her this time .
yeah .
yeah , hanna pretty much does whatever she wants ,
so i figured i would get onboard .
indeed . well , from what i &apos;ve gathered ,
coming here has been a great source of conflict for her .
she &apos;s spoken to you about this ?
she has . we talked about patience and compassion .
it seems like the other day was a bit of a turning point for her .
she &apos;s just starting to come to terms with
all the anger that &apos;s tied to ambiguous loss .
well , then , best press on .
but please give hanna my best . nice meeting you .
yeah . same here .
what was my mother doing here ?
sorry . i can &apos;t talk .
my new attorney made me promise .
what-- what are you saying ?
is my mother your lawyer now ?
no . there &apos;s-- there &apos;s no way--
i never even asked her to help you .
i couldn &apos;t , she still thinks you &apos;re guilty .
what did you say that made her change her mind ?
i gotta go .
wait .
what about jenna , though ? could you at least tell me--
i &apos;m done .
okay , so the lighting in here sucks .
but at least you &apos;re starting to look like someone i recognize .
look , mona ,
i didn &apos;t come here to play beauty shop .
i came here because i know there is a person still in there .
i know you &apos;ve been hurt , but so have i.
and i still am .
trust me , you &apos;re not the first person to hurt me , mona .
and you &apos;re certainly not the last .
you &apos;re getting them again , aren &apos;t you ?
the texts .
hey , hanna . the nurse said that visiting hours are over .
um , yeah , can you , uh , can you give me a minute ?
just tell the nurse that i have to pack up .
mona , what texts are you talking about ?
what texts are you talking about ?
mona .
hanna , come on .
we &apos;re not done with this .
okay ? do you hear me ?
i &apos;m coming back , mona .
ella .
sorry to disturb you . do you have a minute ?
sure .
but if this is about aria--
it &apos;s emily .
what about her ?
well , i saw her after the makeup exam yesterday ,
and she was ... distraught .
she thought she did poorly .
i don &apos;t know if aria &apos;s motioned it ,
but i &apos;ve been helping her prep for these exams , and--
what is your question ?
i just wanted to know how she did .
she did ... fine .
there &apos;s a lot riding on this for her .
now , maybe if she could take it again--
there &apos;s no need for her to take it again , ezra .
i understand what she &apos;s gone through .
emily did very well .
we &apos;re all rooting for her to succeed .
great .
that &apos;s all she said ?
isn &apos;t that enough ?
no . that is not enough .
you have to go back to radley , han . alone .
it &apos;s not so easy . caleb is all over me .
i don &apos;t need to know that .
well , caleb &apos;s not finding dug @-@ up jewelry in his locker .
whose earring did ali find in my dad &apos;s couch ?
one question at a time .
you &apos;re not gonna ask your mom
why she &apos;s suddenly defending garrett ?
i mean , seriously , spencer , what is that ?
he probably told her it &apos;s time to lock jenna up .
she was driving that night , guys . i remembered . clearly .
em , we believe you , okay ?
but honestly , i don &apos;t think
that you remember anything clearly from that night .
when we picked you up you kept calling me &quot; arlene . &quot;
guys , she can see .
she &apos;s probably on mona &apos;s payroll .
mona does not have any cash . they won &apos;t even let her have floss .
okay , let &apos;s just do this at lunch .
i can &apos;t be late again .
i &apos;ll be right back .
i just need to rinse my water bottle .
jenna &apos;s coming in here .
where &apos;s the earring ?
