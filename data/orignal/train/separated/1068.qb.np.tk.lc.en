curtis hagen was granted early release from prison today .
the mosconi codex .
you want me to risk jail for a little light reading ?
special agent david siegel .
you must be my new handler .
must be .
does the name teddy winters mean anything to you ?
they found me .
well , we kept you out of prison .
yeah , it cost me everything .
the codex .
this relationship is working wonderfully .
when does it end ?
when i get what i want .
we &apos;ll find out who did this , neal .
i promise .
david siegel .
found on the corner of linden and central in bushwick .
cause of death was a gunshot wound to the sternum .
he bled out instantly .
we retrieved a shell casing from the scene .
9 @-@ millimeter caliber round from a smith &amp; wesson 39 series .
this image was taken from a traffic cam in the area .
the subject is still unidentifiable .
15 days have passed ,
and we are no closer to figuring out who did this and why .
the working theory stands that agent siegel was a victim
of an indiscriminate mugging gone wrong .
his wallet and firearm are still missing .
our division has dedicated all of its resources
to this investigation .
but the truth is we had caseloads beforehand ,
and those caseloads still need to be resolved .
so the joint operation center will remain in this building ,
and a team of agents will continue to pursue all leads .
the remainder of you will resume your active assignments .
the best way we can honor david siegel
is by doing our jobs .
counseling remains available to anyone who still needs to talk .
that &apos;s all .
you okay ?
yeah . i am . what &apos;s going on ?
you got any updates on caffrey &apos;s status ?
his house arrest is still in effect .
yeah , well , he can &apos;t stay there forever
if you &apos;re gonna use him .
he needs a handler .
ah , bonsoir .
what &apos;s with the bathrobe ?
the water pressure &apos;s weak in the guest room .
i needed to borrow your shower .
how much longer are you staying here ?
just until i get myself on some financially secure footing .
okay if i air dry on the terrace ?
no , moz . tell me how i can help .
big brother burned through all of my resources .
no safe houses , no capital .
what &apos;s worse , the federal bureau of invasion
has confined you to this impenetrable dog pound .
it &apos;s my apartment .
a sublimely spacious cell .
does that make you my cellmate ?
i prefer the term &quot; mis @-@ incarcerated . &quot;
that sounds like you just won a prison pageant .
a , i could . b , i &apos;ll think of a better term .
still working on the codex ?
i &apos;m trying to keep my mind occupied .
and it &apos;s not working .
i can &apos;t stop thinking about siegel .
can &apos;t stop wondering if it was my fault in any way .
if hagen somehow--
stop right there .
the body was found in bushwick .
that &apos;s where hagen and i met a few hours earlier .
it &apos;s not a coincidence .
coincidence is fate &apos;s favorite tool .
you &apos;re condemning yourself
because there &apos;s no one else to blame .
i can &apos;t do anything while i &apos;m stuck here .
i &apos;d be better off with a new handler
or even thrown back in prison .
the suit will never let that happen .
new assignment ?
the department needs a few wins right now .
is that why you called me in ?
we &apos;re going back to work .
we ?
oh , peter , thank you , but you don &apos;t have to do that for me .
i &apos;m asac .
i make decisions around here , and i &apos;ve decided
that i &apos;m going to actively pursue investigations .
that &apos;s what we do .
where do we start ?
accounting scam .
can we start over ?
you don &apos;t get to choose . i choose .
our first case should be a good one .
this is a good one .
now , look here ...
i just fell asleep .
don &apos;t grab me . i &apos;m cooperating .
well , calm down , or i &apos;m gonna throw you in cuffs .
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
guy strolled into the lobby two minutes ago .
said he needs to talk to the fbi .
found this on him .
i need to confess to a crime .
looks like it is gonna be a good one .
nate griffith . in and out of lockup since &apos; 98 .
liked to knock off banks for a while there , didn &apos;t you ?
that was a long time ago , okay ?
i had dues to pay , and i paid &apos; em .
i &apos;ve been trying to do right by my family ever since .
your family .
i &apos;ve got a son .
andrew . he &apos;s-- he &apos;s seven .
why don &apos;t you walk me through this ?
okay , okay .
so i &apos;d heard about this securities vault in manhattan
that supposedly had 2 million in cash in it .
who told you about it ?
just heard . i don &apos;t know .
look , the more you withhold ...
i &apos;m not trying to , i swear .
what &apos;s the name of the company ?
it &apos;s kaplan securities .
so i @-@ i figured out how to bypass the lock system
in the rear of the building .
i just went straight to the vault , and i cleaned it out .
what did you use to crack the vault ?
i think i had the combination .
you think ?
look , i &apos;m telling you the truth .
all right , look , you gotta understand ,
this whole thing-- it &apos;s like some sort of bad dream .
it &apos;s only coming back to me in bits and pieces .
but all i know is that i couldn &apos;t stop .
where was the rest of that money ?
it &apos;s--it &apos;s in grand central in a locker , um--
in number 941 .
combination .
yeah , see , this isn &apos;t a game .
with your priors , you &apos;re looking at ten years .
i know that .
look , an hour ago , i was walking to grand central
to get the rest of the cash , and i just--
i kept thinking about what i &apos;d done ,
how i &apos;d broken that promise
to myself and my family .
and then bam--i get hit by this cab , outta nowhere .
that &apos;s how i got this .
look , it was a wake @-@ up call .
i cannot set a good example for my son
if all i &apos;m gonna do is relapse .
we found those in griffith &apos;s bag--could explain his behavior .
he &apos;s got a pill for every color of the rainbow .
xanax , valium , ativan ...
heavy doses too ,
all authorized by the same psychiatrist .
dr. mara summers .
here . drink this .
thanks .
you don &apos;t seem like those other guys .
that &apos;s &apos; cause i &apos;m not .
in fact , i used to be a lot like you .
you robbed banks ?
i did a lot of things .
the point is i was able to turn myself around
just like you &apos;re trying to do . you can be straight with me .
is there anything else you remember ?
i know you &apos;re trying to help me ,
but i honestly can &apos;t , mr. caffrey .
don &apos;t ever call me mr. caffrey .
it &apos;s neal . come on .
all right , keep looking . update me in 20 .
i sent a team to check the lockers at grand central .
there &apos;s nothing there .
this gets stranger by the minute .
i don &apos;t like it .
really ?
guy walks into the f.b.i with stacks of cash
and begs you to cuff him .
i &apos;d think that was your catnip .
i don &apos;t have catnip .
oh , everybody has catnip .
yeah ? what &apos;s yours ?
real housewives .
can &apos;t get enough .
money has griffith &apos;s prints all over it .
we &apos;re running the serial numbers .
what do you have ?
texture feels funny in the top @-@ left corner of every bill .
i &apos;m gonna need a closer look .
marked bills .
cash could &apos;ve been used in a controlled buy or payoff .
or it &apos;s from another score .
yeah , is it possible our guy stole money
that was already stolen ?
i think neal and i should check out that vault .
f.b.i , here to see the manager .
that &apos;s him there .
familiarize yourself with the database
starting with the client roster on your desktop .
after that , i want you to categorize
this month &apos;s financial packages by date and time .
are you getting all of this ?
yes , sir .
good . back to your desk , then .
apologies , gentlemen .
it &apos;s his first day . how can i help you ?
special agent peter burke ,
and this is my coworker neal caffrey .
how you doing ?
we &apos;re here about the break @-@ in that happened last week .
break @-@ in ?
this morning a known felon walked into our offices
to confess to emptying the contents of vault number four .
oh , impossible .
none of our clients have reported anything missing ,
and i assure you our security is top @-@ notch .
actually , you could use an upgrade .
the u.l. approval on your vaults is class i.
that means they can be breached in 30 minutes or less .
i mean , you need the right cutting wheel
and carbide drill , of course .
my advice , go class iii .
could i see the vault ?
uh , we &apos;re very protective
about our clients &apos; possessions and anonymity .
without a warrant ,
this is all the info i can give you .
feel free to call if you have further questions .
gentlemen .
well , if the cash in the vault was illegally obtained ,
it makes sense that whoever owns it
wouldn &apos;t want to report it missing .
unless they want to go to prison too .
but this is all speculative .
it &apos;s not good enough for a warrant .
louis !
if we can &apos;t get a look at the vault ,
maybe we can find out who owns it .
louis !
thank you .
what &apos;s the play ?
well , kaplan securities is going to have
more than one new employee today .
you still have that brochure ?
yeah .
thanks .
okay .
watch your fingers .
peter ...
you &apos;ve done this before .
instant glue .
well , it &apos;ll do in a pinch .
you frighten me .
actually , you &apos;re usually the frightening one .
you have any pictures in your wallet ?
can i help you ?
eric roberts . i &apos;m your supervisor .
mr. epstein didn &apos;t say anything about you .
i have to call and--
what , you and mr. epstein
are the only employees here ?
look , i know you have those financial packages to work on ,
but this man takes precedence .
mr. wilcox is a premier importer and exporter
up and down the east coast ,
and he &apos;d like to open an account .
he would .
that means start @-@ up papers .
that isn &apos;t protocol . we have a system .
you better make this work .
very good , mr. wilcox .
i &apos;ve been here for five years ,
you &apos;ve been here for five seconds .
start up paperwork .
third office , down the hall , left @-@ hand side .
of course . of course . i &apos;ll be right back .
all right . vault number four .
keep a lookout .
yeah .
technically i should get a court order
to go through that computer .
well , good thing your c.i. doesn &apos;t need one .
neal .
there are 250 clients in this database .
narrowing it down by vault number .
i found it .
vault number four .
that &apos;s strange .
it &apos;s not registered to a person .
to what , then ?
to a corporation . niteowl holdings .
thank you .
thank you very much , sir .
that &apos;s good enough . go .
louis !
it &apos;s a dummy corp .
someone is using niteowl as a front .
whoever griffith stole from covered their identity nicely .
gentlemen , i got a lead on those marked bills .
two months ago , a manhattan mutual truck was cleaned out .
now it &apos;s the bank &apos;s policy to mark all currency
in case any kind of theft occurs .
nypd had a suspect , just couldn &apos;t nail him .
shane jacoby . priors for assault .
and likely ceo of niteowl holdings .
so griffith and jacoby don &apos;t know each other ,
but they &apos;re linked . how ?
i might &apos;ve found that link .
shane jacoby received a court @-@ ordered treatment
from a psychiatrist who prescribed griffith his meds .
dr. mara summers .
there are five common stages to icd ,
beginning with the impulse and ending with guilt or lack thereof .
it is that final--
this is an interesting area of expertise .
yeah , i can see why griffith went to her .
i found the patient who experiences guilt
from his actions is most likely to fall back
into the original destructive pattern .
this is generally the case with the bulk of reformed criminals
i &apos;ve worked with in my studies .
more on that in tomorrow &apos;s lecture .
thank you all for coming .
she &apos;s got clients prone to commit crimes ,
and she &apos;s got access to their heads .
she could be manipulating them .
or she could just be doing her job .
only one way to find out .
excellent , thank you .
thank you .
dr. summers .
i &apos;m sorry , you are ...
my name &apos;s neal caffrey .
i &apos;m a convicted felon , and i need your help .
your work and research on icd is impressive , to say the least .
i have a predilection for its study .
oh , dr. summers , this is the man i told you about , peter .
my parole officer .
how long have you been keeping an eye on mr. caffrey ?
eternally , some might say .
i have to be honest .
most of my work with reformed criminals is pro bono .
right now i simply don &apos;t have time
to take on any new patients .
oh , i &apos;m not asking you for a free session .
i &apos;m expensive .
won &apos;t be a problem .
peter , would you mind briefly
giving dr. summers my resume ?
briefly ? right .
well , neal &apos;s been convicted of bond forgery .
he &apos;s also been implicated in over four dozen
works of counterfeit art .
and there &apos;s also the fact that he &apos;s still a suspect
in several ongoing high @-@ profile federal investigations .
for what , exactly ?
pick something .
bottom line , money may not be a problem for a guy like me .
i didn &apos;t hear that .
my office , 1 : 00 p.m. tomorrow .
i look forward to working with you .
nice job .
two criminals , same psychiatrist .
i think she &apos;s looking after herself more than her clientele .
it &apos;s possible she had a patient
steal from another patient ,
but it &apos;s the how of all this that bothers me .
you can &apos;t put the idea of a heist in someone &apos;s head
without them knowing about it .
peter , it &apos;s not that odd .
think of a number between one and ten .
no , i hate it when you do this .
just think of a number .
two , three , four , five , whatever .
you got it ?
yup .
now say it out loud in your head .
&quot; seven , seven , seven , &quot; for example .
i know what you &apos;re doing . it &apos;s not seven , neal .
no , it &apos;s nine .
okay , how did you do that ?
before i asked you to think of a number ,
i used the word &quot; odd &quot; in a sentence .
so naturally , you &apos;ll choose an odd number .
then ?
then i made your mind
subtly cross off options by saying
&quot; two , three , four , five &quot; and &quot; seven &quot; aloud .
which leaves the numbers one and nine .
and nobody chooses one because it &apos;s too obvious .
nine is more obscure , so that &apos;s what you go with .
that &apos;s good . okay , but the point of all this .
in less than 20 seconds ,
i got you to the number i wanted .
now think of griffith and summers .
with that much time and influence ,
she could make him do anything she wanted .
this guy &apos;s innocent .
i need more , neal .
when you &apos;re with summers , find something tangible
that links her or griffith to jacoby &apos;s cash .
what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;ve got shane jacoby &apos;s work address .
i &apos;m gonna go down there and see if i can find a connection
between him and niteowl holdings .
neal , be careful .
i do not want this therapist getting inside your head .
please . i &apos;m a wall .
really ?
tell me , what kind of change
are you looking to make with your life ?
i guess i &apos;m looking for some normalcy .
thank you .
and what if that &apos;s not possible ?
that doesn &apos;t sound very encouraging .
i &apos;m not here to encourage you .
i &apos;m here to help you discover
the truth about yourself , so you can accept it .
i have to accept that i can &apos;t be normal ?
you &apos;re too interesting to be normal .
what makes me so interesting ?
your pathological assumption that you need to be
the smartest person in the room at all times .
maybe you &apos;re the one assuming things .
according to all these diplomas on your wall ,
you &apos;re a lot smarter than me , but then again ,
those are just papers , not people .
do you think you &apos;re good with people ?
no more than you .
it &apos;s my job .
mine too .
you have an aggressive approach .
and you &apos;re already withholding .
but that &apos;s natural .
we need to know one another better to build trust .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m being honest ?
not yet .
but you will be .
in time .
mr. jacoby !
peter burke , fbi .
what do you want ?
i &apos;d like to talk to you
regarding your vault at kaplan security .
don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
okay , let &apos;s try that again .
where were you on september 4th of this year ?
nypd tried to pin that truck on me .
they had nothing . same as you .
all right , all right , calm down .
i don &apos;t like accusations .
well , then you shouldn &apos;t be a criminal .
i especially don &apos;t like that accusation .
it &apos;s not an accusation . it &apos;s a fact .
read your rap sheet . aggravated assault .
you busted the nose of a security guard
and three of his fingers .
that &apos;s not who i am anymore .
tell me about niteowl holdings .
never heard of that either .
you &apos;re talking to the wrong guy , agent burke .
well , that &apos;s doubtful , but one more question .
how did those court @-@ ordered
anger management sessions go
with dr. mara summers ?
either take me in on something , or let me get on with my day .
nice hat .
you went to brooklyn residential high .
what sport did you play ?
all state in wrestling . are we done ?
mm , not quite ,
but you can get on with your day now , mr. jacoby .
oh , you know that vault that was in kaplan security ,
the one with the $ 2 million cash in it ?
it &apos;s all gone now .
but you knew that .
or you didn &apos;t know that .
well , now you do . have a good day .
job .
confined .
jealousy .
weak .
money .
prop .
women .
hope .
peter .
worthy .
theft .
capable .
caught .
oops .
you make something from that ?
it &apos;s too early to diagnose .
but you &apos;ve got something .
your answers are unique in summation .
i assure you i can handle it , doctor .
your behavior is sociopathic .
i &apos;m sorry ?
you work on perception , the perception of others .
how you think they &apos;ll feel .
this influences your actions and thoughts
more so than your own emotions .
deceit and manipulation are the essential characteristics
of the disorder-- you excel at both .
deceit and manipulation are generalities
that can apply to anyone who lies ,
and everyone lies , including you , dr. summers .
that may be true ,
but not everyone believes their own lies .
why would i delude myself ?
because you don &apos;t want anyone to see your vulnerabilities .
i don &apos;t strike you as confident .
confident people admit to their flaws .
you don &apos;t .
instead you smile a lot .
you &apos;re confident . what are your flaws ?
i can be aggressive , like you pointed out earlier .
i also pick at my nails when i get nervous .
nobody &apos;s perfect .
precisely .
the harder a person fights to be perfect ,
the more he suppresses his true nature .
i &apos;m--
i &apos;m reformed .
are you ?
just because a person starts doing good things
doesn &apos;t mean he wants to stop doing bad things .
of course not .
because everyone has done something bad
at some point in their life , even you .
this is not about me .
i thought confident people could admit to their flaws .
you &apos;re redirecting ...
so are you .
because you &apos;re uncomfortable .
you don &apos;t think that i can change .
i &apos;m asking if you really want to .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t feel well .
like i said , try to relax .
i have a few more questions for you .
what &apos;s happening ?
we &apos;re using a new form of therapy .
you drugged me .
i &apos;m helping you .
i &apos;m helping you .
what i want is for you to simply tell me the truth
about who you are , what you really do ,
and why you &apos;re really here .
i am ready to begin when you are .
neal ?
you okay ?
what happened ?
we began to practice hypnotherapy technique .
you were out for quite some time .
you had trouble waking .
are you sure ?
perhaps you could use something to eat
or a glass of water .
no , i should go .
would you like me to call you a cab ?
no . no .
i &apos;m fine .
peter .
got this from brooklyn residential &apos;s archives .
the year jacoby graduated .
that &apos;s him .
that &apos;s the team that won all state . the owls .
i remembered the mascot when i saw his hat .
championship year for the owls ,
led by team captain shane jacoby .
known for his aggressive takedowns
and late @-@ night practices ,
earning him the nickname the night owl .
and there is our link to niteowl holdings .
call nypd , have our nostalgic friend brought in .
sounds good .
summers is onto me .
what are you talking about ? how ?
i don &apos;t know , but she dosed me with something .
she got me to talk , i can &apos;t even remember what i said to her .
i passed out .
do you know what it was ?
no , i have no idea .
she must &apos;ve slipped it into my water .
okay , we &apos;re gonna get you a tox screen asap .
peter , if that &apos;s the case ,
we have enough to arrest summers right now .
if we bring her in now , there &apos;s a good chance we won &apos;t
find the money she stole . griffith won &apos;t be cleared .
griffith . that &apos;s how she made you .
yeah , i saw dr. summers again .
and you told her i was an fbi agent .
yeah , and he was a consultant .
what are you up to ?
nothing .
look , i didn &apos;t know you were investigating her .
how could i have known ?
look , i had to talk to someone after everything that happened .
jacoby &apos;s not at his residence or any known location .
looks like he went off @-@ grid .
we &apos;re gonna have to track him down .
look , i @-@ i didn &apos;t mean for any of this to happen .
look , you did the right thing coming here .
only after the fact .
what if i can &apos;t change ?
what if i can &apos;t be anything more than ...
a criminal ?
good night , cinderella .
what ?
oh , it &apos;s a drug . good night , cinderella .
it &apos;s most likely what summers spiked your drink with .
very popular with the working girls of rio .
i &apos;ve heard stories .
you &apos;ve heard them or have them ?
what &apos;s the difference ?
the difference is you &apos;ve been using my towels .
what did you put in my fridge ?
oh , i made some hongeo .
can you please unmake it ?
it &apos;s a delicacy .
it &apos;s rotted korean skate fish .
fantastic with , um , kimchi and rice wine .
i thought you &apos;d like some .
all right , if you are gonna live here ,
you can no longer cook here .
jealous of my refined palate ?
i am surprised that one even exists .
good night , cinderella . you were saying .
oh , it &apos;s a combination of ghb ,
ketamine , and flunitrazepam .
the girls give it to their johns ,
and then they do whatever they want while under the influence .
empty out their bank accounts ,
hand them the keys to their car .
next day , most guys don &apos;t recall anything happening .
they just chalk it up to having too much fun .
and you think summers knows about this ?
well , anything &apos;s possible with pharmacology .
she &apos;s a psychiatrist .
she does have a degree in the field .
she &apos;s working with so many so @-@ called criminals ,
she could &apos;ve picked up a trick or two .
i need to find out what i told her .
i could &apos;ve told her everything .
and not just about this case .
what if i said something about hagen ?
or siegel ?
there &apos;s a way to find out .
r.m.t.
recovered memory therapy .
what do you know about it ?
it &apos;s simple .
i drink too much wine , i forget things .
in order to remember them , i drink more wine .
i &apos;m sure you do .
to recover a memory , it &apos;s often most effective
to recreate the conditions one was experiencing
at the time of that memory &apos;s loss .
so what you &apos;re saying
is i need to go back down the rabbit hole ?
look , even if i were gonna consider this ,
would you be able to find this stuff on the street ?
no , of course not .
i &apos;d have to make it for you .
you &apos;re sure this is the exact combination that summers used ?
pretty sure .
one of the few certainties in life
is that persons of certainty should certainly be avoided .
that does not make me feel better .
okay , i made a few modifications .
i added a mild stimulant
to prolong your vision quest .
great .
the more time you spend awake in this altered state ,
the better our chances of success .
and there are no lasting effects .
no , in fact you &apos;ll be
in complete control of your faculties ,
thanks to my added potassium stimulant .
as long as i wake up when it &apos;s over .
neal , you &apos;ll be fine .
i am your sherpa guide .
your spirit animal
for this fantastic voyage you &apos;re about to embark upon .
trust me . this is the solution .
boa noite cinderela .
remember the office .
the shapes , the textures , the view .
dr. summers is sitting across from you .
she &apos;s waiting for you to lose your inhibitions .
what is she saying ?
i &apos;m ready to begin when you are .
take a deep breath , and stay calm .
you won &apos;t remember what you tell me once the narcotic wears off .
did she ask you any questions ?
yeah , she wanted--
she wanted to--
what does the f.b.i know ?
everything .
what can the f.b.i prove ?
nothing .
did you ask her any questions ?
you stole the two million . why ?
for the same reason you steal .
because it was there .
this isn &apos;t gonna work .
i can &apos;t think straight .
that &apos;s exactly the point .
think circular .
no , i mean summers .
she was right . i &apos;m not reformed .
i mean , i like doing the things i do .
you know , i like working with peter ,
i like working with the f.b.i.
okay , that &apos;s simply the drugs talking .
but i also like working against &apos; em .
i like doing things i shouldn &apos;t , and i don &apos;t feel guilty ,
i don &apos;t feel remorse , i don &apos;t feel anything except--
okay , too much stimulant .
maybe you should take some of the solution too .
yeah , it could help you remember .
remember what ?
who you are .
what are you doing here , moz ?
you should be out on the streets rebuilding yourself .
you are smart , you are resourceful .
you can do anything without a height requirement .
it isn &apos;t so easy .
has big brother really finally just cornered you into defeat ?
i &apos;m gonna get a pen and write some of this down for research .
go .
okay , we should take it fr--
oh , no .
burkes .
neal .
what are you doing here ?
no .
i just came to get some stuff off my chest .
i was in seventh grade , i didn &apos;t know any better ,
but the money was sticking out of her purse ,
and boop , mine .
it was the same thing with the garrido self @-@ portrait in belize .
i mean , i wasn &apos;t taking that out of a purse .
it was more like a highly secured wing
of a central american antiquities center .
am i talking too much ?
is he okay ?
i have no idea .
i am conducting an experiment .
i am trying to remember
what i said to summers when i was under--
it &apos;s hot in here .
what did you do ?
i talked to mozzie , and he gave me a solution ,
and i drank that solution .
i don &apos;t understand .
he drugged himself in some ridiculous experiment
to recreate what he said to the psychiatrist .
neal , are you hungry ?
you look like you could use something to eat .
i &apos;m actually not hungry right now ,
but if you have any of those fantastic game hens you make ,
maybe later .
oh , no meat loaf , though . i &apos;m not a fan .
honey , could you excuse us for a minute ?
yeah .
neal .
do you know what happened to siegel ?
you &apos;re not answering my question . siegel .
i don &apos;t know what happened , and--
what aren &apos;t you telling me , neal ?
oh , good .
for the love of thoreau ,
you can &apos;t simply wander off into the woods like that .
hey , moz .
what &apos;re you doing in my house ?
he ran away like an impudent child
chasing after an untethered balloon .
what happened ?
we tried something , and it worked .
he was starting to remember parts of the conversation
when summers had him under .
but you only have about 15 minutes left , at best .
then he &apos;s gonna want nap time .
all right , let &apos;s do this .
neal .
take a deep breath .
close your eyes .
yeah .
just try to remember where you left off .
what does the f.b.i know ?
summers asked me what the fbi knew .
she realized we have nothing .
what did she ask next ?
she asked about ...
griffith .
will the fbi prosecute ?
they will soon .
that &apos;s good , neal .
stay focused .
after that , she stood up .
where did she go ?
to make a phone call .
who did she call ?
i saw the number she dialed .
it was a 212 area code .
three fives ...
0 , 1 ...
two more digits , neal .
0 , 1 ...
8 , 4 .
nice work .
let &apos;s find out who she called .
this is jacoby . leave a message .
she called shane jacoby .
neal , we &apos;re gonna have to--
grab you a blanket .
i &apos;ll take him .
what , are you gonna carry him ?
i &apos;ll have you know i &apos;ve been doing a lot of wrist curls .
you &apos;ve done plenty . i &apos;ll take care of him .
jones .
i want to see griffith tomorrow ,
and i &apos;m gonna need you to come with me .
now &apos;s not really a good time .
make time .
you don &apos;t know shane jacoby .
i told you guys , no , i don &apos;t .
well , he may know about you .
summers made contact with him yesterday .
i &apos;ve told you everything that i can .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m really sorry , guys , but you &apos;re gonna have to leave .
i have to pick up my kid from school .
just had to follow up on this .
we &apos;re doing everything we can to figure out what &apos;s going on here .
you don &apos;t waste our time ,
mr. griffith , we won &apos;t waste yours .
i &apos;m telling you the truth .
i believe you .
and i know that you have to see your kid ,
so we &apos;ll be on our way .
but if anything should come up ,
you make sure you call us . you got it ?
yeah , yeah . got it .
we &apos;ll be in touch .
all right , they &apos;re gone .
daddy , what &apos;s happening ?
it &apos;s okay , buddy .
back up .
yeah , he &apos;ll be okay .
as soon as you tell me where you stashed my two million .
otherwise ...
otherwise what ?
you put your hands in the air , and let go of that kid now .
peter , you good ?
yeah , i &apos;m good .
get him outta here .
remember when i said we weren &apos;t done ?
now we &apos;re done .
all right , the first time out ,
summers manipulates griffith to steal from jacoby .
then she turns it around .
she steers jacoby towards griffith .
well , it makes sense on her part .
jacoby tries to kill griffith , lands himself in jail ,
and she walks with the money .
there &apos;s still no physical evidence pointing toward summers .
only psychological manipulation .
what &apos;s our best option ?
find the money , which is probably well hidden .
or get a confession out of summers ,
which is all the more unlikely .
not necessarily .
there &apos;s always a solution .
i &apos;m glad to see you &apos;re feeling better .
i got a new perspective on things .
tell me about that .
well , i can admit that
i don &apos;t know if i can control my natural impulses .
but that lack of control doesn &apos;t make me feel helpless .
how does it make you feel , then ?
free .
so you admit you still like to commit criminal acts .
i &apos;m gonna commit one right now , as a matter of fact .
where &apos;s the money ?
the money you had griffith steal .
you can play dumb all you want , doctor , but it won &apos;t last long .
the drugs will take effect soon .
that &apos;s not possible .
i removed the water bottles and poured it myself .
you &apos;d be surprised how easy it is to reseal a plastic lid .
are you picking your fingernails , doctor ?
cause that would mean you &apos;re nervous .
are you nervous ?
you can &apos;t do this to me .
tell me where the money is .
the fbi will never find it .
no , they won &apos;t .
i am a criminal , after all .
you helped me realize that , so thank you , doctor .
all i need from you ...
is a confession .
i &apos;m ready to begin when you are .
dr. mara summers , you &apos;re under arrest
for theft , possession of illegal narcotics ,
and malpractice .
on the basis of what ?
your confession .
i knew shane jacoby stole that money .
idiot may as well have had &quot; guilty &quot; tattooed across his forehead .
i followed him to the vault where he hid the cash .
this isn &apos;t legal . you drugged me .
i think you mean you accidentally drugged yourself .
we &apos;re gonna do a tox screen on you
that &apos;s probably gonna match the unprescribed cocktail
you dosed neal with at his session .
and in trying to drug me again ,
peter &apos;s going with the theory
that you made the mistake of switching bottles ,
inadvertently harming yourself .
that sounds about right . take her .
ma &apos;am .
you do understand
you &apos;ll never be anything more than what you are .
but at least i &apos;m free ,
which is more than i can say for you .
come with me .
so that &apos;s it ? i &apos;m in the clear ?
the bureau is not pressing any charges
due to the psychological duress you were under at the time .
thank you .
thank you .
yeah , of course .
no , no , thank you for showing me
that guys like us can be more than what we were .
good luck .
seems like he &apos;s feeling better .
yeah . how about you ?
how does it feel to close a case again ?
i &apos;m not so sure the case is closed .
summers cracked and told us where she hid the two million dollars .
but when we went to retrieve it , it wasn &apos;t there .
hmm , good thing we got a confession .
you &apos;re telling me i can have this ?
consider it an apology for all the things i said the other night .
they were things i needed to hear .
it &apos;s time to rebuild the empire , my friend .
word of caution . the bills are marked .
i can get 50 percent on the dollar . still a pretty good haul .
i figured it wouldn &apos;t be a problem .
this is illegally obtained contraband
from one of your very own suit &apos;s federal investigations .
so why &apos;d you take it ?
because it was there .
one day i &apos;ll find the right words ,
and they will be simple .
kerouac .
yeah .
can &apos;t get much simpler than that .
not for guys like us .
guys like us ? you coming back to the life ?
so what &apos;s your first plan of action ?
change the state of play .
i &apos;ve been serving too many masters .
i &apos;m through being everyone &apos;s puppet .
hagen , the fbi ...
which strings , exactly , do you plan on cutting ?
when the time comes ... all of them .
