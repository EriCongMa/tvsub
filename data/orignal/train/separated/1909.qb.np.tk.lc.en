&quot; i bet it stung &quot;
here &apos;s what i learned my first day at medical school :
think long and hard before choosing to become a surgeon .
it takes 100 % commitment .
this is killing me .
i need coffee .
four days back to work , and i &apos;m ready to end it all .
i don &apos;t even know how we survive four days .
coffee &apos;s on !
that &apos;s how .
you have to be on your &quot; a &quot; game
every single time you walk into that o.r.
when patients are lying on your table
completely at your mercy ,
they need to know that when you make that first cut ...
you know what you &apos;re doing .
no other specialty requires the time , the focus ,
the complete dedication ...
except maybe being a mom .
okay , so daddy is gonna drop you off at day care ,
and i am going to pick you up , okay ?
then we &apos;ll have a princess tea party
at the end of the day .
okay , ladies , let &apos;s go .
wow . we &apos;re good at this .
oh , pump !
yeah .
oh !
okay . mwah !
mwah .
maybe we &apos;re too good at this .
james evans , 57 , post @-@ op day 6
from an emergent tricuspid valve replacement
due to endocarditis .
hey , could you change it to &quot; jimmy &quot; ?
and go ahead and fix the age , while you &apos;re at it ,
to something in the 40s .
deep breath .
is that thing you put in there still working ?
i think you &apos;re good .
the new valve should last 10 to 15 years .
dr. wilson &apos;s going to do
a treadmill stress echocardiogram just to be thorough .
thanks , doc .
anything to get me out of this dress .
okay .
oh . u.n.o.s. has a possible match
on one of my transplant patients .
uh , page me with his results .
okay .
looking at your dad &apos;s chart ?
he &apos;s not my dad .
that &apos;s why i took my mom &apos;s last name .
so there &apos;s nothing connecting me to the guy .
he &apos;s funny .
yeah ?
you should talk to him . tell him who you are .
maybe he &apos;s changed . you &apos;ve changed .
the last time i saw his face ,
i was punching him so hard , i could have killed him .
i &apos;m just afraid i &apos;ll pick up where i left off .
hey !
you &apos;re doing a heart / liver on samantha calder ?
yep .
i saw her before i went on leave .
i &apos;m the one who diagnosed
the familial hypercholesterolemia .
oh , well , you were right .
so let me take the liver .
really ?
yeah , really .
why didn &apos;t you think of me in the first place ?
i guess i thought you were easing back in ?
i don &apos;t ease back in . i jump in the deep end .
i swim .
all right .
uh , well , have you read the cleveland article
on simultaneous heart / liver transplants under c.p.b. ?
i have not . is it different from a regular heart / liver ?
i will read it .
hey , you &apos;re doing a heart / liver ?
yeah . uh , but i don &apos;t need you .
you paged me .
you stole my liver ?
uh ... come on . i deserve this .
i &apos;ve been on the bench for months .
you deserve nothing .
i named my son after you .
you can &apos;t be mad at me .
your son is the devil &apos;s spawn .
he drinks the milk of a liver thief !
morning , dr. kepner ,
dr. robbins .
mm . hi .
coffee ? i thought you could use it
before your big surgery with dr. shepherd .
that &apos;s ... nice .
what did i do ?
something nice , apparently . i didn &apos;t get a coffee .
no .
no . i think i actually did something really , really bad .
i think that i brought her back to my apartment
the night of the gala .
you think ?
i don &apos;t know . i was drunk .
i barely remember even getting home .
and then i have a vague memory of her in my kitchen .
and now she &apos;s being really friendly .
did i flirt with her that night ?
uh , all i remember
is waking up in my bathtub with my spanx still on .
oh , well , at least we know you &apos;re good .
hey , um , some mortgage slips for the apartment came .
okay .
you &apos;re welcome .
you want me to thank you for giving me
the mortgage slips to my apartment
that you &apos;re living in ?
listen , if you want me to move out , just say so .
i don &apos;t want to live in the apartment
that i shared with my cheating wife .
i gotta go . thanks !
i think i overslept .
what do you think ?
of ?
my shirt ?
yes .
you &apos;re introducing me to your mother .
i need to make a good impression ,
so i am going for ,
&quot; yes , i am an intern dating your son
who is a fellow and a member of the board and an avery .
but before you write me off as a gold digger ,
you need to know i am a kick @-@ ass surgeon ,
and your son is lucky to be dating me . &quot;
that is a lot of pressure to put on a shirt .
oh , it &apos;s not working alone .
there &apos;s a lip gloss in my locker that &apos;ll assist .
oh , yeah .
well , she is gonna love you .
mm . not -- not here . hmm ?
what ?
stop . we &apos;re not those people .
oh , i know . yeah .
banana bread .
i &apos;m starving ... mmm .
help yourself .
i was too busy feeding my family breakfast
and getting my sister wife &apos;s breast pump packed
to feed myself this morning . so ...
you have a sister wife ?
derek and meredith and i are in a relationship .
i used to dance in my underwear .
and i thought i &apos;d get back to that when i left arizona .
instead i walked right into &quot; big love . &quot;
i rebounded to the mcdreamys .
hmm , hang glider trauma ?
yeah .
where did you get this ? it &apos;s amazing .
it &apos;s good , right ?
emma made it .
fetal surgeon emma from the gala ?
oh , my god . you &apos;re rebounding , too .
what have we got ?
her name is reese woods , 22 .
hang gliding over tiger mountain ,
b.p. &apos; s 100 / 70 , open tibia fracture ,
and complains about abdominal pain .
can i say , &quot; i told you so , &quot; now , reese ?
who &apos;s this ?
oh , that &apos;s donna . she &apos;s the sister .
although she acts like she &apos;s my mother .
i am not doing this again .
i &apos;m not watching you try to kill yourself .
it &apos;s just a little break . don &apos;t be so mad .
okay , this isn &apos;t bone . this is a rod .
when did you have this rod put in ?
this march . she broke it heli @-@ skiing in new zealand .
she &apos;s also broken , uh , both forearms ,
lost a kidney , dislocated her shoulder .
wow , you really do have a death wish , huh ?
i guess i &apos;m just making up for lost time .
i &apos;m seeing a lot of free fluid in morrison &apos;s pouch .
we &apos;re gonna need to get her up to c.t. stat .
okay , now show catherine your party trick , sir .
oh ! oh , he &apos;s acting all too cool for school right now .
but yesterday , when he made it to the chair ,
he was smiling from ear @-@ to @-@ ear .
okay , okay . okay .
you are doing so well !
i think you &apos;ll be doing laps by next week .
excuse me , sir . your , uh , drain output has been a little low ,
and we were told to come by to strip your j.p.
we can come back later if this isn &apos;t a good time .
well , i actually wanted to talk with dr. bailey .
so right now is a great time .
i need a hand to get back in bed .
well , what are you two waiting for ? help the man !
oh , yeah .
of course .
okay .
i was expecting more .
but he couldn &apos;t sit up two days ago .
he &apos;s depressed .
have you considered antidepressants ?
of course i have .
and he refuses . he says he &apos;s fine , and he is .
he needs time , support ,
and more pillows if he &apos;s ever gonna be able to sit up comfortably .
i &apos;m gonna go get those .
miranda ... i &apos;m so sorry .
you &apos;ve done so much , and i am grateful .
i &apos;m here to help . so let me .
all right .
pillows .
oh , my god !
hi .
jackson ... where are your manners ?
mom , this is stephanie edwards .
steph , this is my mom .
dear , would you mind handing me the pillows
from the top bunk ?
okay .
i don &apos;t think she liked my shirt .
ma , hold on .
you are aware that you &apos;re on the board of this hospital ,
as well as an avery .
you don &apos;t know what i went through
to get these pillows .
meant to lock the door .
good morning , sir . how are you feeling today ?
he &apos;s a mess .
who taped this i.v. ?
it &apos;s fine .
maybe it was edwards .
her mind &apos;s obviously not on patient care .
that is not fair , mom .
this is not me being a prude .
i like sex just as much as the next person .
oh , god , please .
but there is a time and there &apos;s a place .
he said he meant to lock the door .
you be quiet .
where are your compression socks ?
they went to get another pair .
maybe they got distracted by edwards &apos; breasts .
and i &apos;m out .
i &apos;m just looking out for you .
hey , sam .
dr. grey ... where &apos;s your baby belly ?
it turned into a baby boy .
congratulations .
i would show you a picture , but he &apos;s so cute ,
you may have another heart attack .
she &apos;s had a bunch of them .
not recently , though .
i think the yoga music helps .
absolutely .
he hates the music .
i loved it ...
for the first few months .
well , now that we &apos;re getting you a new heart and liver ,
you can flip out like the rest of us .
and have a baby , like dr. grey .
or be a ground @-@ breaking surgeon , like dr. yang .
i &apos;m a surgeon , too .
oh , yeah . of course .
dr. grey does it all .
it &apos;s so impressive .
i don &apos;t know how you handle everything .
i don &apos;t know either sometimes .
what ?
did you want to examine the patient ?
hello , mr. samuels . i &apos;m dr. edwards .
it says here you haven &apos;t been able to urinate
since yesterday .
let &apos;s take a look .
uh , it &apos;s no wonder you can &apos;t urinate .
your penis is quite swollen .
i think i got a bug bite .
that &apos;s a big bug bite .
it &apos;s ... more of a bee sting than a bug bite .
still pretty swollen for a bee sting .
do you have a history of allergies ?
it wasn &apos;t really one bee . it was several .
well , what &apos;s several ?
i don &apos;t know ...
25 ? 30 ?
30 bees ?
i know . it &apos;s crazy , right ?
but see , it was saturday ,
and we have this hammock in the backyard .
and i thought i &apos;d make some lunch .
so i took my pants off and ...
made a honey sandwich .
wh--a honey sandwich ?
peanut butter and honey sandwich .
&apos;cause who eats a honey sandwich , right ?
right .
and i was eating the honey sandwich .
and i fell asleep . and i guess i got some honey on ...
myself .
and the bees caught the scent .
okay .
well , i &apos;m gonna get you a dose of i.v. benadryl
and a steroid .
and then we &apos;re gonna get you a catheter so you can pee .
dr. edwards .
would it make a difference if it were hornets ?
the patient is a 14 @-@ year @-@ old male ...
all right , one second . excuse me .
fourth day back , and i &apos;m already scrubbing in
on a heart / liver transplant with cristina .
well , fantastic !
yeah .
can you pick up the kids this afternoon ?
i would , but i have to entertain all of them .
they &apos;re visiting neurosurgeons
watching my a.v.m.
q &amp; a after .
i promised zola a princess tea party .
have callie do tea .
it was supposed to be me , or in a pinch , you .
it &apos;s so she knows that
she hasn &apos;t been replaced in our hearts
by a new baby brother or by a multi @-@ organ transplant .
it &apos;s an over @-@ determined tea party .
i &apos;ll talk to callie .
i didn &apos;t realize i &apos;d have to work this hard
to get out of here .
five more minutes .
i lost out on three gigs since i &apos;ve been in here .
if i can play tonight ,
maybe this trip won &apos;t be a total wash .
do you have any family or anyone i can call
to come pick you up ?
no , i &apos;m good .
how about i make a call to a rehab clinic ?
don &apos;t you worry about me , darlin &apos; .
i know i had some junk in my system when i came in here ,
but i &apos;m a recreational user .
your left arm , right arm , and the backs of both your knees
tell a different story .
it took my half an hour to find a usable vein on you .
i know what you &apos;re gonna do when you leave here .
i &apos;ve got people i can call . i got family .
i don &apos;t think you do . or maybe you did ,
but i think that you &apos;re on your own now .
well , you know all about me , don &apos;t you ?
i know that we have you on methadone right now ,
which is a big step towards recovery .
let &apos;s just try to keep it going somewhere--
kid , i play blues guitar .
i &apos;m not christina aguilera .
i can &apos;t afford those places , not the good ones .
let me make some calls for you , please .
boy ...
you are as persistent as you are annoying .
you can walk as fast as you want ,
but you &apos;re not going anywhere .
neither am i.
what is wrong with callie ? she still hasn &apos;t called me back .
ah , the recovery team texted ,
two minutes until they open the donor .
hey , ross ?
could you run down to the e.r.
and ask torres if she can pick up the kids today ?
sure , but i have to get this blood to the lab--
and remind her about the princess tea party .
it has to be today .
well , that &apos;s pretty cool .
the tea party ? yeah .
i mean , it &apos;s just apple juice and cookies ,
but she &apos;s excited about it .
not the tea party .
you and me doing ground @-@ breaking surgery--
that was the idea when we started .
yeah . it &apos;s pretty cool .
do you need to go pump ?
no , i &apos;m fine .
you &apos;re holding your boobs .
but we &apos;re having a moment . i don &apos;t want to spoil it .
mer ... your boobs are exploding . go pump .
thank you .
so she might lose the kidney ?
whoa , whoa , whoa , let &apos;s--
let &apos;s not jump ahead .
no , please .
worst @-@ case scenario . i like to be prepared .
well , the worst @-@ case scenario is she needs a kidney .
so we start to look for a donor .
okay . well , that &apos;s me .
i &apos;m her donor .
so you &apos;ve been through this before ?
oh , yeah . yeah . take your pick ...
bone marrow , blood , uh , liver ,
anything you can think of , i &apos;ve given .
what &apos;s mine is hers .
except i haven &apos;t given a kidney yet . so ...
yay !
sounds like she &apos;s extremely accident @-@ prone ,
even for a daredevil .
no . all the parachuting and stuff--
it started when she went into remission .
my sister was diagnosed with aplastic anemia when she was 2 .
well , that must have been hard .
it was lucky that you were a match .
oh , it wasn &apos;t luck .
i &apos;m a donor baby .
you &apos;re her younger sister .
yeah .
my parents only had me to save her .
how did that happen ?
it &apos;s a long story .
can you see any access to get the catheter in ?
no , it &apos;s too swollen .
it looks like it was mauled by a pissed off badger .
you should have seen it before the i.v. benadryl kicked in .
we need to get someone from urology down here now .
don &apos;t you think i tried ? there &apos;s an emergency ,
and the on @-@ call guy is 20 minutes away .
dr. wilson , it feels like i might explode .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s gonna last 20 minutes .
dr. avery , i &apos;m--
darling , save your breath .
there is nothing you can say after this morning
to get in my good graces .
i have a giant penis .
no , not me . i don &apos;t have a gi--
i &apos;m a girl . uh ... i have a patient ,
and he has a giant penis .
it &apos;s the biggest one i &apos;ve ever seen , and i &apos;ve seen a lot of ...
you make me nervous . i need a consult .
better go take a look .
this rod caused a lot of bleeding .
we &apos;re gonna be here a while .
i hope you don &apos;t have plans with your girlfriend , hunt .
she &apos;s not my girlfriend .
she baked you banana bread
and brought it to you at work . you &apos;re practically engaged .
matthew brought me breakfast burritos ,
and now we &apos;re getting married .
just saying .
damn it . the superior pole of this kidney
is almost completely avulsed ,
and the pedicle is gonna need some repair .
you think the sister &apos;s prepared to consider donation ?
she can &apos;t seem to say no .
dr. torres ?
hmm ?
dr. grey is going into surgery .
she wants to know if you can pick up her kids at 3 : 00 .
she said to mention promising zola a princess tea party ?
tell her i &apos;ll be out of here by ... 6 : 00 .
so she can &apos;t say no .
oh , my god . you &apos;re right . i need to get a life .
you know what ? maybe i should kick arizona out
and move back into my place .
but she needs the elevator .
and it &apos;s right across the street from the hospital ,
which is perfect for her .
we drank three bottles of champagne and puked .
it bonds you .
mm @-@ hmm .
plus it &apos;s already been retrofitted
to be handicap @-@ accessible .
kepner--
i &apos;m shutting up .
no , no . look at the kidney .
we &apos;re gonna need some laps and a vascular clamp .
kepner , get the 4 @-@ 0 prolene stitch .
of course , now my mom &apos;s convinced that stephanie
is some kind of gold digger , trying to use sex
to nab herself an avery .
dude , you and your rich boy problems .
you know what the worst part is ?
i think she actually likes stephanie .
well , so then you need to tell your mom that .
stand up for your girl .
that wouldn &apos;t work . she &apos;d just hate her even more .
so what are you gonna do ?
nothing .
you know , it &apos;s like walking into a hornet &apos;s nest .
you know , you gotta stay still . let the whole frenzy die down .
how you doin &apos; with that coffee , karev ?
you wanna make the damn coffee ?
be my guest . it &apos;s a freakin &apos; crap machine .
what &apos;s wrong with him ?
beats me .
alex just broke the coffee machine .
you &apos;re dead to me .
dr. yang just got a call from--oh , god . i &apos;m sorry .
oh , shane , all my parts are covered .
you can turn around .
i &apos;m fine looking at the wall .
oh ! um , organs are good .
let &apos;s go tell samantha .
she &apos;s lactating .
i need 10 minutes . i have 4 more ounces to go .
uh , okay . page me when you &apos;re done .
oh , dr . torres is in surgery .
she can &apos;t get the kids until 6 : 00 at the earliest .
6 : 00 is too late for a tea party .
tea time is at 4 : 00 .
do you want me to tell that to dr. torres ?
no , it &apos;s just that i promised .
just forget it . forget it .
there will be other tea parties .
well , this is how it starts .
i make a promise . i break it .
ten years later , i &apos;m my mother ,
and zola &apos;s snorting oxy behind the school .
nice .
you know , it goes faster when you do both sides at the same time .
how about i quiz you ?
i thought you hated me .
i do .
so hook up the pump before i change my mind .
dr. robbins discovered the spinal a.v.m.
when the patient was 12 . it has since grown .
we are going to use a far lateral retroperitoneal--
excuse me .
yes .
you suggested a posterior approach ?
why go anteriorly ?
did i say that ?
well , i also said the segway was gonna hit big , but , uh ...
anyway , that-- that theory has been elaborated .
excuse me .
sorry . pardon me .
who knew dr . shepherd was such a big shot ?
what are you doing here ?
you told me to scrub in .
the night of the gala ? at your house , remember ?
oh , yeah . that night was so fun .
yeah . don &apos;t worry . i won &apos;t tell anyone what happened .
hey , um ... it &apos;s a little tight in here .
uh , you could probably be more useful
managing patients on the floor .
oh . yeah . you &apos;re probably right .
okay , sweet girl , just one more .
that &apos;s it . shh ... shh , shh .
stop .
stop what ?
doing that-- making that dog face .
it &apos;s puppy dog eyes , and i &apos;m not .
these are my regular eyes .
what do you want ?
your dad passed his stress test .
yang told me to discharge him .
good .
say it .
i never had a father .
i made up , like , 15 versions of one--
a college professor who would read to me ,
a plumber who snuck me into movies .
like , three doctors , one who would take me
to feed the ducks in boston commons .
i want to cry when i think about it ,
and i made it up . i wanted one so badly .
alex , you have a father .
i know , and he &apos;s a dirtbag ,
and i didn &apos;t make that up .
just discharge him .
then , uh , he woke up , and hornets were stinging him .
just on his penis ? accidentally ?
um ... yeah ?
young man , did you put your penis in a hornet &apos;s nest ?
no .
maybe .
yes !
get another 50 of fentanyl for the pain .
when there &apos;s no access for a catheter ,
you need to go directly into the bladder .
any intern should know that .
let &apos;s just pray we &apos;re not too late .
what happens if we are ?
hey , something just happened .
i @-@ i feel like i don &apos;t have to pee anymore .
that .
the bladder bursts . there &apos;s a moment of relief and then--
book an o.r.
get dr. hunt to extend me privileges .
i am going to the o.r.
one of your fine young residents
just let a man &apos;s bladder explode .
which resident ?
the one who was so busy shaking her tail in front of my son .
oh , edwards isn &apos;t dumb .
you &apos;re right .
she &apos;s strategic . jackson is dumb .
catherine--
i &apos;m going to go and salvage this patient &apos;s manhood .
but when i come back ,
i want to have a serious conversation with you
about coming home with me .
sorry . i came to see if your drain output picked up
after we stripped it , but ...
i can come back later .
you &apos;re not progressing very quickly here .
they &apos;re all in love with you , and afraid of you .
so they &apos;re coddling you . it &apos;s very sweet ,
but ultimately a disservice .
you need to push yourself .
you need someone to push you .
this is a long road , and the slower you go down it ,
the poorer your chances are .
i love you , but i will not coddle you .
i never learned how .
come here .
just think about it . please ?
you &apos;re a goddess .
i know .
this is grey .
dr. grey ...
it &apos;s karen at the day care center .
zola took a spill off the slide ,
and she nicked the side of her head .
she &apos;s probably going to need a few stitches .
is she able to stand ?
did she ever lose consciousness ?
what happened ?
i &apos;m a teacher ...
she cut her head open .
well , go . i &apos;ll tell yang .
okay .
so tell cristina
to go ahead and talk to samantha without me ,
and i will meet her in the o.r.
okay .
poor baby .
all right . i got a quick consult on a stevens johnson syndrome ,
and then i &apos;ll be right in to check in on my mother &apos;s penis .
i mean , the patient &apos;s penis that my mom asked me to consult on .
why couldn &apos;t she have been a hand specialist or ears or something ?
does it really have to be you and me and your mom
all staring at a penis ?
it is not that loaded for her .
okay , it &apos;s her work . she loves it .
just ask her questions and make it medical .
she &apos;ll probably forget about me and you .
honestly , she probably already forgot .
how nice to see the two of you together again ,
and all dressed this time .
i did it ... &apos; cause i &apos;m amazing .
wait . what are you doing ?
i &apos;m discharged , right ?
oh , no . we &apos;re keeping you here overnight
&apos;cause i got you 28 days at somerville
starting tomorrow . it &apos;s a good center .
strong program , great people ,
and they said that they would waive the fees for you .
i appreciate it .
that &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s all set up .
and they &apos;re gonna come get you tomorrow--
why are you doing this ? what is your deal here ?
i mean , you pull your strings
for every itinerate junkie musician that shows up ?
you said that you would go if i set it up .
you said that you would go .
no , see , i never said that .
that &apos;s against my policy . that &apos;s how you screw up .
you tell someone you &apos;re gonna do something ,
you set &apos; em up for disappointment .
that &apos;s how you lose your home ...
your family . make your children hate you .
look , you &apos;re a sweet kid ,
and i don &apos;t even know you .
but i don &apos;t want to let you down , too .
all right ?
&apos;cause you &apos;d never let me hear the end of it , you damn nag .
jimmy , if you keep going the way that you are going--
i appreciate your concern ...
more than i can say .
just take care now .
you can help .
oh , my god .
he &apos;s leaving ,
and he &apos;s miserable ,
and he &apos;s full of regret about you .
and you &apos;re angry . and you &apos;ve always been angry .
and i think this could help you , too .
and i think it &apos;s your last chance
because he &apos;s gonna go and use again ,
and he &apos;s gonna die .
look , don &apos;t talk to me about this again .
all right ? ever .
oh , how &apos;s zola ?
oh , she &apos;ll be fine .
once grey gets down there , she &apos;ll stitch her up ,
and be back in time to scrub in .
it &apos;s happening again !
oh , she &apos;s desatting .
uh , i &apos;m gonna intubate .
push 5 of versed and
100 of succinylcholine .
what happened ?
she &apos;s gone into heart failure again .
check on the organs and book an o.r.
we &apos;re bring her down as soon as she &apos;s intubated .
okay , got that closed up .
now let me see . did i miss anything else ?
i don &apos;t see anything .
that &apos;s what &apos;s called a rhetorical question , my dear .
all right , let &apos;s take a look at this penis , shall we ?
uh , dr. avery , can you elaborate
on some of your more interesting cases ?
i &apos;m fascinated by all things penile .
yes , i saw evidence of that earlier this morning .
how &apos;s it looking , dear ?
well , it &apos;s possible he &apos;s gonna need a skin graft ,
but nothing i can &apos;t fix .
yeah , he &apos;ll be able to stick it in a hornet &apos;s nest ,
an ant hill , a tarantula &apos;s ...
wherever they live .
well , i find that men often put their penises
in places that they don &apos;t belong .
suction , dear , come on .
okay , supergirl .
that &apos;s the only ouch @-@ y part .
now you &apos;re not gonna feel anything at all .
you are so brave . i &apos;m so proud of you .
my patient &apos;s going into the o.r.
when ?
right now .
it wasn &apos;t supposed to be for another hour at least .
well , go ahead .
i &apos;ll have jenna come in and hold her .
doesn &apos;t that sound a little ellis grey to you
to leave my kid to go to surgery
while she &apos;s getting stitches ?
you &apos;re a good mom , mer .
take it from me . i had crap parents .
i know the difference .
besides , she &apos;s not gonna be alone .
she &apos;s gonna be with me ,
who she loves more than her own parents .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m doing this .
yeah . can you send jenna in here ?
look , don &apos;t cry , or she will .
the general surgeons weren &apos;t able to repair
your sister &apos;s kidney , so ... we &apos;re gonna
let &apos;s just cut to the chase .
eventually , she &apos;s going to need a kidney .
right ?
okay .
well , here i am .
open the toolbox .
take whatever she needs .
hey , look , this doesn &apos;t have to happen right now .
okay , sh @-@ she &apos;ll be on dialysis until we find a donor .
you don &apos;t need to be spare parts for your sister anymore .
here &apos;s what i need .
i need a boyfriend ...
and a job ...
and a caribbean cruise ...
and i would like to learn to ride a bike ,
because i never learned to ride one when i was little .
i couldn &apos;t get injured
&apos;cause reese might need some body part .
and i &apos;d love to not be
spare parts for my sister anymore ,
but can i do that ?
can i say no ?
yes , you can say no . it &apos;s your life .
you know , you should ride that bike .
go on that cruise . get a boyfriend .
dance in your underwear .
yeah , you can say no .
i can say no .
yeah , it feels good , right ?
i can say no !
you can say no !
no ! no ! no !
oh , sweetie .
i &apos;m his wife . i was out of town .
what happened ?
well , he ... came in with quite a few stings
in his groin area . and ...
oh , no .
he didn &apos;t .
he stuck his penis in that hornet &apos;s nest , didn &apos;t he ?
you knew ? how ?
i saw a nest on the eaves as i left .
i knew i should have had it removed .
so ... this is something he &apos;s done before ?
he &apos;s someone who ...
likes a little pain with his pleasure .
any kind of sting , really .
bee , ant ...
i &apos;m sure he was ashamed .
that &apos;s why it took him so long to come in .
i don &apos;t understand it either .
but it &apos;s just one thing .
there are 500 things about him ...
that are so much more interesting .
that is not possible .
i &apos;m here .
what &apos;s she doing here ?
she &apos;s doing the liver .
i &apos;m doing the liver .
she needed two staples .
i actually left her in the hands of jenna-- that nurse
that-- i don &apos;t care about zola .
i &apos;m thinking about the patient .
whoa , dial it back for a second .
does she have a concussion ?
no , she &apos;s fine . are you ?
you &apos;re gonna be worried about that
and a hundred other things besides my patient and my liver .
she is my patient ,
and she was my patient before--
did you finish reading the article on performing
simultaneous transplants completely under c.p.b. ?
dr. bailey knows the procedure .
dr. bailey is scrubbing in on mpatient .
sorry .
probably should have checked back earlier .
your ... white blood cell count is elevated .
i &apos;d like to start you on antibiotics .
why do i need antibiotics ?
because there &apos;s a left shift ?
you need to examine me
to find out what &apos;s causing the elevation .
murphy ...
i don &apos;t want to be coddled or pussy @-@ footed around .
no offense . it makes you a bad doctor
and me a sicker patient . so buck up ,
lift my gown and give me a proper hands @-@ on exam .
yes , sir .
it ... feels distended .
okay , what does that tell you ?
there could be fluid buildup . okay .
you &apos;re checking the drain ?
there &apos;s no output .
okay , what else ?
you have epigastric tenderness , increased w.b.c. ,
and little to no drain output ,
which means you have a ...
symptomatic pancreatic leak . okay .
which also means i &apos;m in a great deal of pain .
now you need to try and unclog the drain
with a fogarty catheter so this doesn &apos;t happen again !
god .
there &apos;s the bossy richard i know and love .
they &apos;re gonna learn how to look me in the eye
and explain to me what they &apos;re doing
so i understand .
when i ask a question , they &apos;re going to answer it .
they &apos;re gonna figure out why my pancreas
still requires a drain .
so i ... take it
you &apos;re not coming home with me .
these fools need me , catherine .
what if i need you , too ?
come here .
you got me .
i &apos;m right here .
going back to the tribe ?
after i grab sofia . how about you ?
seeing your not @-@ girlfriend ?
that was the plan ,
but i &apos;m going to talk to the hang glider &apos;s sister .
she decided to donate a kidney after all .
take it easy , pal .
how &apos;d it go ?
her initial labs look good .
she &apos;s headed down to the cardiac i.c.u.
if you want--
you stole that surgery from me .
i &apos;m sorry .
i really wish you could have been in there with me .
i worked my ass off to do that surgery with you ,
and you stole it from me . that was low--
meredith , you were unprepared , you were unfocused ,
and you were late .
i didn &apos;t steal that surgery from you .
i rescued that surgery from you .
i--
because you couldn &apos;t do it .
i understand that you believe you are god &apos;s gift to medicine ,
but i am every bit as talented and competent
a surgeon as you are .
no ... you &apos;re not .
i &apos;m sorry ...
but you &apos;re not .
and that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s okay .
you have different priorities now .
you cut back on your clinical hours ,
you log in less time in the o.r.
i mean , you don &apos;t do research , and i get it .
i mean , you have zola and baby bailey , and--
and you want to be a good mom .
i don &apos;t believe you .
you are saying that i can &apos;t be a good surgeon and a mom .
of course not . bailey is a mom , and she--
i mean , she was fantastic in there today .
then what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying ...
i &apos;m s--okay . bailey never let up .
okay , she , like , lives here .
callie never let up .
ellis grey never let up .
and i know you don &apos;t want to be your mother .
i &apos;m saying ...
i &apos;m saying ...
you and i started running down the same road
at the same time ,
and at a certain point you let up .
you slow down .
and don &apos;t say that i don &apos;t support that , because i do .
you made your choices , and they are valid choices .
but don &apos;t pretend they don &apos;t affect your skills .
you ... are a very good surgeon . it &apos;s ...
we &apos;re in different places now .
and that &apos;s ...
okay .
i mean , they were huge . they were hard to hold .
yeah ?
yeah , they kind of hooked like that .
you see those people down there ?
those are the top 12 neurosurgeons in the world ,
and they need a drink .
you got it .
i am going to need my place back .
look , i feel bad about kicking you out ,
but i need to stop taking care of other people .
i took care of you for a year .
i picked you up off the bathroom floor .
i took your abuse .
but you &apos;re not sick anymore .
now you &apos;re just someone who cheated ,
and you did that to yourself . so ...
i &apos;m sorry , but i need my life back .
i need me back , and i need to do it tonight ,
or i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ll change my mind . so ...
i will have an intern pack up your stuff
and bring it to the hospital tomorrow .
you can stay at my place .
okay , you know what ?
okay . just-- just tell me ,
what did i do ? what did we do ?
&apos;cause clearly something happened after the gala ,
and whatever it was ... i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t--
oh , my god .
i can &apos;t believe you don &apos;t remember .
i was drunk , and you &apos;re pretty--
we hung out .
after i put you in the cab ,
i called to see if you and kepner made it home .
and you didn &apos;t answer , so i went to check .
and good thing , because you were passed out
on the hallway floor .
i helped you inside ...
and you insisted on having a dance party .
we made the most amazing grilled cheese sandwiches
and ate them while we watched the films
of dr. shepherd doing the spinal a.v.m.--
which he did today--
which is when you asked me to be there .
it was the first time i felt like
i found someone around here who got me .
do you really not remember any of it ?
i vaguely remember the grilled cheese .
let &apos;s go back to the part where you said i was pretty .
that part ?
excuse me , dr. avery . do you have a minute ?
i &apos;m meeting my son , edwards . it &apos;s been a long day .
i just think that we probably got off on the wrong foot .
your feet were not the issue , dear .
i know how it looked .
i &apos;m quite sure you don &apos;t .
no , i really do .
i was having a quickie with your son in the on @-@ call room .
and it suggests i have no self respect .
i suggests that i , like much of my generation ,
don &apos;t understand that where we choose to have sex .
says a lot about what we think of ourselves .
and a lot of the work you did to break down barriers
for women--and in particular , women of color--
was a whole lot of wasted fort .
i picked a shirt to wear today
because i knew i &apos;d be meeting you--
a really respectable one .
meeting jackson &apos;s mother meant something to me .
i care about him .
and the shirt coming off in the on @-@ call room--
that was really , like , a joke about people
who have sex in on @-@ call rooms .
and that &apos;s the only thing you &apos;re gonna think of
when you think of me now .
there are 500 other things about me
that are so much more interesting than that .
well , i will also think about the fact
that you didn &apos;t put in a catheter
until the man &apos;s bladder--
okay .
in all fairness ,
i wasn &apos;t getting all the information i needed to diagnose .
when in doubt ,
assume they put it someplace unimaginable and move on .
i was just leaving .
well , what &apos;s your hurry ? i &apos;m buying .
so ...
sleep tight .
what if your focus splits ?
what if you can &apos;t be all in ?
are you left with nothing at all ?
maybe you just need to find a different path .
how &apos;s zola ?
karev filled me in . said she was a real champ .
she didn &apos;t get her princess tea party .
wait . i thought callie was gonna do that .
callie has moved out ,
and she was supposed to do the food shopping .
so now there &apos;s no food .
zola has two stitches in her head
and had cereal for dinner ,
and the house is a mess
because i couldn &apos;t get the baby to sleep .
and she didn &apos;t get her princess tea party .
why are you yelling at me ? i had a big surgery .
so did i !
but you didn &apos;t answer your phone .
she cut her head , and you didn &apos;t answer your phone .
so i had to go comfort her , which means that
i didn &apos;t get to do my surgery--
a heart / liver transplant .
those never happen ,
and i didn &apos;t get to do it .
i &apos;m sorry , but that is not my fault .
it is your fault because you didn &apos;t answer your phone !
i was in a surgery .
i shouldn &apos;t have to choose between being a good mother
and being a good surgeon .
i never asked you to do that .
never have i asked you to do that .
here &apos;s what &apos;s horrifying--
what if you can &apos;t give a hundred percent ?
maybe you just need to go back to the beginning ...
