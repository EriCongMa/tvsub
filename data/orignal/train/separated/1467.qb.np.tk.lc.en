haley , hurry up !
you don &apos;t have much time , and i made chocolate chip pancakes .
mom , i &apos;m not 12 .
dibs on hers .
honey , you excited about your first day ?
you know what ? i really am .
there &apos;s something about going to work
that makes you feel like you &apos;re ...
i don &apos;t know , worth something .
no offense , mom .
listen ... i wanna give you some advice .
do it fast . she &apos;s gonna be late .
work hard .
keep your eye on the ball .
stay focused .
never ... check it out !
cam in overalls !
mitchell sent me the same text !
why &quot; look what you &apos;ve done &quot; ?
oh , because cam is helping me out
with that baseball field ,
and mitchell hates it when he gets all farmed up .
his turn @-@ offs are farm , fizbo ,
and , worst of all , farmbo .
howdy , life pardner !
well , i gotta go . don &apos;t wanna be late for my first--
oh , my god ! why didn &apos;t you guys tell me the time ? !
so what do you think ? can we turn this into a baseball field ?
oh , yeah . no problem .
you know , back on the farm ,
i once turned an acre of corn into a snowflake @-@ shaped maze .
it &apos;d still be there if our neighbor billy bob sheinberg
hadn &apos;t seen it from his crop duster
and said it looked like a swastika .
so how good &apos;s luke &apos;s team anyway ?
well , you may have seen them on youtube
under &quot; boy stuck in batting helmet &quot;
or &quot; pitcher beans self . &quot;
but a few of them went through puberty early this year , so ...
they say it &apos;s because of hormones in our milk .
but whatever it is , they really jacked up .
luke and manny &apos;s team tied for the final spot in the playoffs ,
but since nobody was expecting it ,
all the fields were booked .
the other team wanted to settle with a coin flip .
we said &quot; rock paper scissors . &quot; that &apos;s when talks broke down .
so what do you do when you can &apos;t find a field ?
you build one .
and we got the last laugh ,
&apos;cause guess what i found there ?
rocks , paper , and scissors .
i see home plate up here .
mm @-@ hmm .
i see pitcher &apos;s mound in here ,
and i see little boys &apos; dreams coming true everywhere .
i found a dead snake !
it &apos;s perfect .
not dead ! not dead !
i &apos;m gonna be mother of the year .
and this is our dining room , where we eat .
and this is our kitchen , where we also eat .
who are you talking to ?
it looks like you lost your tour .
or your mind .
the baby .
shorty &apos;s girlfriend darlene send it to me .
she said it &apos;s for prenatal bonding .
i love it . we took a tour of the house .
we took a look at all my shoes .
come on , jay . say something to the baby .
darlene &apos;s an idiot .
oh , yeah , beautiful .
your first words to our baby--
&quot; darlene is an idiot . &quot;
this is stupid . the baby &apos;s only 2 inches away .
he doesn &apos;t need speakers blasting at him .
like in restaurants nowadays
where you can &apos;t even hear yourself think .
ah , you &apos;re gonna do whatever you want . why do i bother ?
get used to that . sometimes you just gotta let him go .
then he eats some sherbet and falls asleep .
okay , i &apos;ll chalk the field with this bad boy .
and while you &apos;re doing that , i will get the bases .
we make such a good team .
why does your friend have a chalker ?
oh , he used it to propose to a skywriter .
oh , ma &apos;am ? ma &apos;am , do you need help with that ?
oh , yes . please .
is this your house ?
i &apos;m moving in with my son .
he &apos;s rich .
phone by the toilet rich .
all right , so have you lived here a long time ?
i moved here in &apos; 62 to be an actress .
i had one line in a &quot; rockford files . &quot;
&quot; he went out the back . , &quot;
who went out the back ?
that was you .
well , you &apos;re all set here .
you &apos;re not interested in the place , are you ?
oh , no , thank you .
yes--yes , we are .
yes . yes , we are .
come on .
okay .
you gotta keep your eyes open .
it &apos;s not natural when a ball is hurtling at your face .
will you choke up a little ?
probably when they play the national anthem .
no , move your hands up the bat .
&quot; when they play the national anthem . &quot;
i had a perfect record--
22 games , and i hadn &apos;t played a single inning .
then the mccoy twins &apos; grandma dies ,
and suddenly i &apos;m starting at right field .
what does that even mean ? is it the same as stage right ?
all right , ready ? nice and easy .
i haven &apos;t even thrown it yet .
then it &apos;s your fault . i &apos;m doing my part .
forget it . we need to do something different .
let &apos;s change your stance .
try leaning in .
further .
now close your eyes .
ah ! perfect ! you think you can do that every time ?
what , get hit on purpose ?
if you wanna get on base and be a hero .
some men are born into greatness .
others have it chucked at their face .
yes !
okay , mrs. brooks , thank you very much .
we &apos;ll be in touch very soon .
say it one more time .
he went out the back .
oh , love it ! love it !
brava ! brava !
bye @-@ bye !
what do you think , phil ?
well , i have to admit , it &apos;s a steal .
yes ! yes ! i told you !
and you said gil thorpe makes a killing flipping houses .
yeah , he brags about it all the time .
every time he makes a sale ,
he calls himself &quot; flipper &quot;
and walks around making this dolphin sound . like ...
how does he do it ? i hate him so much .
okay , look , if the four of us go in on this together ,
we can minimize the risk .
or if none of us do it ,
we can eliminate the risk altogether
because none of you know anything about flipping houses .
okay , well , we already have it figured out .
i &apos;m gonna be the designer ...
because i know about colors and shapes .
yeah , so does lily .
i &apos;m gonna be the contractor .
and i &apos;m gonna be the astronaut . oh , this is fun . phil , you go .
mitchell , i am serious .
i have overseen lots of projects in our home .
i oversaw the remodel of our bathroom .
under budget . right , phil ?
yeah . i was a little disappointed we didn &apos;t go for
the butt @-@ washing toilet , but otherwise ...
you can wash your own butt for free .
well , that &apos;s not the same , is it ?
this is all fun to talk about .
it is , but i don &apos;t think that you understand
what--what this could really entail . and--
okay , there it is . mitchell just said &quot; no , &quot; so we &apos;re done .
surprise , surprise .
listen , we &apos;ll talk about this at home , okay ?
don &apos;t give up .
phil , you think it &apos;s a good idea , right ?
totally .
yes . and you know we can handle it , right ?
i think you guys can handle anything .
and you go talk to him . you &apos;re a professional .
he respects you .
okay . give us some space . i &apos;ll go talk him into it .
all right .
all right ?
okay .
okay .
listen ...
there &apos;s no way we &apos;re letting them do this .
i know , right ?
they are not equipped to take this on .
we might as well flush all our savings
down my boring old toilet .
oh , you are really bitter about that .
it &apos;s the one thing i asked for . don &apos;t sit on your sunglasses .
sorry , guys .
whoops . just to be clear , though .
under no circumstances are we letting them do this ?
i am totally with you .
okay , you stay here . i &apos;ll go break the bad news .
sorry , guys . not gonna happen .
yeah , well , maybe if--
i would drop it .
it &apos;s not worth the fight . come on , claire .
the faster we leave , the less it &apos;s gonna hurt .
hop in . yep .
why does it have to be like this ?
i don &apos;t know . he &apos;s your brother . buckled up ? good .
no ! no ! no , no , i see what you &apos;re doing !
he doesn &apos;t want this either !
little radio ?
sure .
phil ! claire !
come on !
it &apos;s such a shame
because i know we would do a great job on that house .
totally .
if gil thorpe can do it , i can do it , right ?
please !
please . gil thorpe has decades of experience
and infallible instincts .
as much as we &apos;d all like to believe otherwise ,
i did not marry gil thorpe .
can you imagine that ?
god , we &apos;d sell a lot of houses .
oh ! great .
mitchell .
oh , you know what , claire ?
you gotta cool down or you &apos;re just gonna make this worse .
why don &apos;t you go get the coffees ?
and i &apos;ll deal with him .
well , okay , what are you gonna say to him ?
i &apos;m just gonna talk to him man @-@ to @-@ man .
right .
okay .
hello ?
claire , phil doesn &apos;t want the house either , all right ?
he &apos;s letting me take the fall . he &apos;s a liar .
and a clever one .
ugh ! how long do you think you can keep this from her ?
all right ? i &apos;m gonna talk to her eventually .
well , as long as we &apos;re swapping stories ,
maybe i &apos;ll tell cam
what happened to the sweater he knit for you .
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t ! i can &apos;t !
i can &apos;t do it ! i can &apos;t take this stupid thing anymore !
it was stolen out of the car . do you understand me ?
got it .
that is low .
i know . don &apos;t be mad at me .
that said , i suggest you lose this number .
i &apos;m not proud of what i did ,
but i &apos;m not comfortable squashing people &apos;s dreams .
i am a cheerleader .
i &apos;m the guy on top of the pyramid shouting ,
&quot; go , dreams , go ! &quot;
you know what &apos;s not a cheer ?
&quot; two , four , six , eight ,
you are going to fail at this
and lose everything we &apos;ve worked for , claire !
* hush , little baby , *
* don &apos;t say a word . *
* papa &apos;s going to buy you a mockingbird . *
* and if that mockingbird won &apos;t sing , *
* papa &apos;s gonna buy you a diamond ring . *
papa &apos;d buy ten diamond rings
to get that mockingbird to shut the hell up .
but i wasn &apos;t gonna tell gloria she was a terrible singer .
that &apos;s just taking a bath with a toaster .
still , the thought of
that poor little thing stuck in there like a hostage ,
listening to that racket days on end ...
i just couldn &apos;t take it .
* and if that billy goat won &apos;t push , *
* papa &apos;s gonna get every le-- *
i &apos;ll tell you what papa &apos;s gonna do .
he &apos;s gonna take a turn on that mic .
oh ! really ?
yeah , i &apos;ve been thinking ,
if it &apos;s a chance to bond , i should take it .
ay , jay , that &apos;s great .
i think that the sound of my voice
shouldn &apos;t be the only thing that the baby should hear .
same page .
breaker , breaker , big jay .
baby , what &apos;s your 20 ? over .
ay , that &apos;s so cute .
you sound like smokey and the bandito .
go on . go on .
hi , kid . this is your dad jay pritchett .
uh , we &apos;re all pretty excited to meet you .
just a heads @-@ up--
i might be a few years older than you &apos;re expecting .
but on the plus side , we &apos;re very comfortable .
what &apos;s that ? nothin &apos; ?
tough womb .
what are you doing in there ? you sleepin &apos; ?
* are you sleeping ? *
ah ! ah ! ah !
* are you-- *
ah ! still daddy &apos;s turn .
dumb--dumb rock !
are you cryin &apos; ?
no .
no . i just can &apos;t get this rock to budge .
okay , what did we learn from &quot; a league of their own &quot; ?
no crying in baseball .
no . that madonna &apos;s a lousy actress ,
and so are you .
what &apos;s really going on ?
okay .
you know , over the last couple of months ,
i &apos;ve applied for , like , five different jobs .
i didn &apos;t know that .
no . i didn &apos;t tell anyone ,
because i didn &apos;t get them , cam .
i went to college , you know ?
and ... i just wanna be able to contribute to my kids &apos; education .
and i wanna be able to buy my husband a present ...
with my own money .
hey , you &apos;re preaching to the choir director .
it &apos;s actually why i became a choir director .
you became a part @-@ time teacher in a public school for money ?
i make more than you do .
i mean , before parking . but ...
look , i &apos;m sorry mitchell killed our house dream .
you know , now especially that i know you wanted to use the money
for such noble reasons .
yeah .
and also ...
there was this pair of boots .
there &apos;s always a pair of boots .
mitchell , do you know what i &apos;ve realized ?
that some thoughts are better left unexpressed ?
no . that in this relationship ,
i &apos;m the gas pedal , and you &apos;re the brakes .
okay , wait . wait . wait . wait . wait .
last week , you said that
you were the painting and i was the frame .
that &apos;s if we were artwork .
this is if we were a car .
i know what part you &apos;d be if we were a horse .
excuse me ?
hmm ?
claire and i bring you this great opportunity ,
and you stop it cold .
i guess that &apos;s what brakes do .
you know what brakes also do ?
they keep you from driving off cliffs .
maybe they &apos;re not cliffs . maybe they &apos;re ramps ,
ready to launch us into new , exciting vistas .
i am not the only one against this whole house thing .
phil doesn &apos;t want it either .
you keep saying that ,
but i find that very , very hard to believe .
phil supports claire .
phil is a cheerleader .
why can &apos;t you be more like phil ?
and then it hit me .
i could be exactly like phil .
i could pretend to be on board ,
forcing the cheerleader to be the bad guy .
i know it &apos;s underhanded ,
but that &apos;s the way i throw .
mitchell ?
you--you know what ?
you &apos;ve convinced me .
if--if you and claire and especially phil
are into this , then i &apos;m on board .
what ? seriously ? !
yes ! 100 % .
in fact , why don &apos;t you call claire and phil
right now and tell them ?
okay . it was the ramp thing , wasn &apos;t it ?
you know , i felt really good about it .
what ?
are you serious ? that &apos;s fantastic !
oh ! i gotta tell phil . i &apos;ll call you right back .
what &apos;s--what &apos;s up ?
mitchell changed his mind .
he &apos;s all for it . we &apos;re flipping a house !
yeah .
yeah !
well , hello , phil .
to what do i owe this pleasure ?
cut the crap .
you wanna play chicken ? chicken &apos;s my middle name .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i &apos;m just being supportive of my partner and my sister ,
both of whom i love very much .
how do you sleep at night ?
soundly , knowing you &apos;ll do the right thing .
so how about it , phil ?
you gonna stop this train ? &apos; cause these brakes are out .
oh . and i suggest you lose this number .
mitchell ?
mitchell ? !
yeah , i was pretty ticked off
that mitchell double @-@ crossed my double @-@ cross .
and then he stopped taking my calls ,
and so i sent him the following carefully worded text ...
&quot; u suck . &quot;
i could tell phil felt pretty hurt
and betrayed , so i responded .
&quot; how r u gonna cheerlead your way out of this one , buffy ? &quot;
&quot; we both know this house thing is a disaster . &quot;
&quot; then say something , or i will .
i don &apos;t care if you tell cam ... &quot;
&quot; i threw out that hideous sweater ? ! &quot;
i spent months knitting that hideous sweater .
yeah .
w--how are we seeing this ?
they &apos;re using the group text from yesterday .
they have no idea these are even coming to me .
okay .
oh . here &apos;s another one .
&quot; we need to shut this house thing down
without them knowing it &apos;s us &quot; ? !
oh ! well ...
&quot; 2 late . &quot;
no , that--that &apos;s bad .
claire , i am so sorry .
i know i should &apos;ve been more honest with you , but i--
no , phil .
you know what really kills me ?
is you didn &apos;t believe in me , and you believe in everything !
you know , i knew that sweater wasn &apos;t stolen .
and here i pick blue yarn to match your eyes ,
but i should &apos;ve picked black to match your heart .
although you look amazing in black . damn you .
come on .
... &quot; leaving 17 dead and thousands without power . &quot;
ay , jay , please !
it &apos;s bad that the baby listens to such terrible things .
he &apos;s heard worse .
jay , do you know a good 1 @-@ hour dry cleaner ?
and i don &apos;t mean the &quot; must be in by 10 : 00,
only on weekdays , you need a coupon &quot; kind .
i mean a hard 1 @-@ hour .
this conversation feels like a hard one hour .
and what do you need it cleaned for ? it &apos;s spotless .
there &apos;s mustard here from reuben &apos;s reuben .
that &apos;s what happens when
you put a narcissist in charge of snack day .
okay , it &apos;s my turn again .
baby , it &apos;s your mother again .
i &apos;m--
gloria ?
why don &apos;t we give him a break ?
he probably needs a minute
because he just learned about a deadly tornado .
okay , stop calling him a he .
what if he &apos;s a she , and you &apos;re making her upset ?
i told you . that &apos;s just the shorthand i &apos;m using .
don &apos;t jump down my throat every time i &apos;m
ay , yes ,
because you always
what are you doing ?
do you really want your unborn baby
to hear you fighting like this ?
studies show it &apos;s unhealthy
for a fetus to be exposed to a stressful environment .
studies ? you &apos;re 13 . read a comic book .
what time does your game start ?
i have to be there at 3 : 00 for hitting practice .
batting practice .
not for me .
jay , i don &apos;t want our baby to think
that it &apos;s coming into an unhappy home .
let &apos;s promise that we &apos;re never ever going to fight in front of him .
no fighting in front of the baby .
okay , good .
* twinkle , twinkle *
* little lamb *
gloria , stop it ! stop it . no more singing .
why ?
because you stink .
you &apos;re a terrible singer .
come on . let &apos;s get some lunch .
how dare do you say that i am ...
i know ! ay , no , no , no .
no fighting in front of the baby . we just made a deal .
yeah , but that &apos;s not fair
because i am always in front of the baby !
gloria , you &apos;re as close to perfect as woman gets .
nothing wrong with one tiny , little flaw .
yours is when you start to sing ,
is sounds like something got stuck in the vacuum cleaner .
that &apos;s--you &apos;re just--
no , no , no .
that is just your stupid , stupid opinion , jay .
but i am very angry at you ,
and i am gonna make a list
of all the things that i am going to scream at you
as soon as this baby &apos;s out of me .
i didn &apos;t think it all the way through .
oh , hello , mitch .
uh , you got claire flowers ?
yes . i had a little bit of a rough night .
yeah , you and me both .
daddy slept in my room last night .
here , give me some of those .
what ? no .
you got me into this .
hey , stop ! you &apos;re breaking them !
i need--i &apos;m not going to cam empty @-@ handed !
phil , let go of the ...
hold still !
claire and cam did all this ?
a week ago , that was all junk .
it &apos;s amazing .
i mean , there &apos;s that little bump in the middle .
but other than that ...
even if one of those boys had hit five home runs ,
the biggest star on that field was claire .
that &apos;s the funny thing about marriage .
you fall in love with this ...
extraordinary person ,
and over time , they begin to seem ordinary .
i think it &apos;s all the nagging .
wow . this ...
this is incredible .
you literally saw a diamond in the rough .
yeah , but i take on a lot of projects no one else is willing to .
i deserve that .
i was an idiot for doubting you .
please , honey , forgive me .
how could i not ,
when you give me this bouquet of crumpled flowers ?
mitchell did that !
mitchell again ?
ask lily !
hey , cam .
hey .
here you--okay . well ...
oh , wow . broken and mangled ...
just like my heart .
cam , i &apos;m sorry for not supporting you .
what about the sweater ?
that &apos;s unforgivable .
i mean , you put all that time and work into it ,
and i just toss it out the car window .
tossed it out the car window ? !
i &apos;m forgetting how much you knew .
you know what , guys ? honestly , i ...
i think we should do it . i think we should go for the house .
really ?
okay , but careful , honey .
don &apos;t say something if you don &apos;t mean it .
no , i do mean it . i think you two will do a fantastic job .
you know , i do , too . i &apos;m on board .
on board for what ?
oh , well , the four of us , uh , might go in on a house .
claire and i fix it up and flip it .
that &apos;s the worst idea i ever heard .
you guys know nothing about construction .
you &apos;ll make all sorts of mistakes ,
you &apos;ll turn on each other , you &apos;ll stop talking ,
and suddenly i &apos;m doing two dinners a week instead of one
because you can &apos;t be in the same room .
family and business doesn &apos;t mix .
ah , you &apos;re gonna do whatever you want . why do i bother ?
is he right ?
y @-@ you know dad . i mean , he &apos;s a pessimist .
i want us to get that house .
i do . but i don &apos;t want us to fight .
we &apos;re not gonna fight .
of course not .
probably .
i don &apos;t know . will we ?
maybe we just take a beat and think about it .
yeah . i @-@ i guess that couldn &apos;t hurt .
yeah .
you guys mean the world to us .
i don &apos;t want to jeopardize that over a house .
we feel the same way .
i know .
i just wanna say i know we &apos;d do a good job , though .
hello ?
and i feel so--
it &apos;s mrs. brooks , the lady with the house .
actually , it &apos;s good that you called .
what ?
what happened ?
gil thorpe just made her an offer .
we did it !
we bought a house .
it &apos;s gonna be ... great !
what could go wrong ? nothing .
sometimes i don &apos;t understand people .
they do crazy things for the dumbest reasons .
i &apos;m going to march out there and swing as hard as i can .
and if every sports movie is correct ,
i &apos;m going to smack that ball ,
and everyone will chant my name as i round the bases .
by the way ,
it is always counterclockwise , or do i get to choose ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s gonna matter .
they convince themselves it &apos;ll all work out ...
please rise for the national anthem .
i &apos;m gonna show you who can sing .
gloria .
oh , this is gonna be rough .
despite all the evidence to the contrary .
oh say can you see ?
by the dawn &apos;s early light ?
which i guess isn &apos;t so bad .
and the rocket &apos;s red glare !
all i &apos;m saying is ,
i hope to god you don &apos;t have your mother &apos;s singing voice .
but , man , i hope you get her self @-@ confidence .
try to get some sleep .
i &apos;ll talk to you in the morning .
2 outs , bottom of the sixth . tied at 4 .
this is it , folks .
the whole game comes down to this .
manny delgado 0 for 3 on the day .
gloria , your thoughts ?
i think he &apos;s going to hit the home run .
please , god , give me one .
manny , stand up straight !
but bend your knees .
widen your stance !
would you please let me just--
take your base !
you did it ! you got it , manny !
i did it ?
no , no , no , no ! not that way ! go this way !
oh , why do i bother ? he &apos;s gonna do what he wants .
