morning .
morning .
sleep okay ?
mm @-@ hmm . great .
hey , can i ask you something ?
sure .
last night , me wanting to try that stuff out
of the kama sutra ,
was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive ?
yeah , just because you &apos;re in bed with an indian woman ,
you think that gives you permission
to use crazy positions from an ancient indian love manual ?
hey , if you can find a book called
weird sex with white boys , i &apos;d be okay with that .
no , no , you have such beautiful eyes .
have you ever thought about getting contacts ?
i tried in the seventh grade .
i could never get used to them .
oh , that &apos;s too bad .
yeah , if i had contacts i would have been
the coolest debate club president
ever to be stuffed into his own cello case .
if you had them on now ,
you could see what we &apos;re going to do next .
th @-@ that &apos;s okay . i can infer from context .
hey , raj , wanna see a new magic trick i &apos;ve been working on ?
howard , if i may interject here
with a piece of friendly advice .
is working on magic tricks
really how you want to spend your time ?
granted , you &apos;re just an engineer , but ...
that doesn &apos;t mean you might not someday build a geegaw
or a thingamabob that may get you a &quot; thank you &quot;
in someone else &apos;s nobel prize acceptance speech .
is the trick making him disappear ?
sure , let &apos;s see it .
here , shuffle these .
okay .
now spread them out on the table face down .
pick one , look at it .
okay .
now remember your card , put it back in the deck .
is it any wonder he doesn &apos;t have a doctorate ?
remind me , what &apos;s your birthday ?
october sixth .
okay , october is the tenth month .
so ten-- one plus zero is one , plus six is seven .
turn over the seventh card .
how about that !
is that your card ?
yes , it is . very cool !
it &apos;s not cool .
it &apos;s a childish trick designed
to confuse and intrigue simpletons .
how &apos;d you do it ?
a magician never reveals his secrets .
but surely a future nobel prize winner can figure it out .
fine .
give me a second .
you ever notice when he thinks real hard , it smells like bacon ?
oh , hey !
sorry ! oop !
sorry ! pardon me !
oh , i &apos;m so sorry !
oh , that was my fault .
check it out .
i just got contacts .
one , two ,
three , four , five .
no way .
that &apos;s your card , right ?
seven of clubs !
that is amazing !
it &apos;s not amazing .
all magic tricks are merely a combination
of manipulation and misdirection
with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet .
oh , really ? so how did i do it ?
i don &apos;t care how you did it .
i have more important things to think about .
clearly , the cards are marked .
i thought you had more important things to think about .
i do . you just happened
to have caught me on a break .
oh , let me see those cards .
big deal . not knowing
is part of the fun .
&quot; not knowing is part of the fun . &quot;
was that the motto of your community college ?
hey , guys , what do you think ?
priya took me clothes shopping .
hey , you look great .
good for you , priya .
i could never get that stupid hoodie off him
when we were ...
well , you look great .
thank you .
let &apos;s go hang everything up .
yeah , good .
new contacts .
i should have done this years ago .
so you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis ?
i &apos;m not going out with him .
he can sleep with whoever he wants .
yeah , i was talking to raj .
oopsy .
this deck is rigged in some fashion .
fine . get another deck
and i &apos;ll do the trick with that .
so you &apos;re saying this is a regulation deck ?
i &apos;m saying believe in magic , you muggle .
you know , well , i &apos;m happy leonard &apos;s found someone .
not that anybody asked .
how many &lt; i &gt; star trek &lt; / i &gt; uniforms do you have ?
just two :
everyday and dress .
listen , we need to talk about something .
oh , my god , you &apos;re breaking up with me !
why would you take me out shopping
and then break up with me ? that is so cruel !
leonard , i &apos;m not breaking up with you .
oh , okay .
so , what &apos;s up ?
it &apos;s a little weird ,
your ex @-@ girlfriend hanging out here all the time .
i know .
i usually never see my ex @-@ girlfriends ,
unless their hard drives crash .
i &apos;m just saying , how would you feel
if i was hanging out with my ex @-@ boyfriend ?
um , not great , i guess .
but penny and i are just friends .
i don &apos;t care .
this is a woman you have slept with .
if you want her around ,
then i have to wonder if maybe you &apos;re not ready to move on .
no , no @-@ no @-@ no , i &apos;m ready !
i gave up the gift of sight for you .
if that &apos;s not moving on , what is ?
you need to cut the cord with penny .
oh ... okay .
you don &apos;t sound very confident .
no , no , i &apos;m confident .
its not like i &apos;m unfamiliar with the &quot; get lost &quot; conversation .
although , this will be the first time i &apos;ll be the one saying it .
thank you .
i appreciate it .
sure .
oh , god , you smell so good .
of course , that could just be
my other senses getting stronger .
hypothetically , if i had access
to a lieutenant uhura uniform , would you wear it ?
leonard , it &apos;s a source of great pain to me and my family
that my brother has that outfit in his wardrobe .
can we not discuss it ?
i &apos;m sorry . never mind .
and was your card the jack of diamonds ?
oh , unbelievable !
know how he did it yet ?
aw , he has the same look my little nephew gets
when he can &apos;t figure out how i got his nose .
you know , i have some remedial magic tricks
that might be more your speed .
like , ooh , look !
the pencil &apos;s rubber !
hey , i think i know how you did the card trick .
oh , please , if i don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s axiomatic .
come here .
you &apos;re right .
not too bad for someone
who doesn &apos;t know what &quot; axiomatic &quot; means .
what happened with the contacts ?
one of them &apos;s upstairs .
the other one sort of slipped back into my skull .
hey , is that one of the new shirts priya got you ?
yeah .
you don &apos;t wanna wash that .
no ?
no , that &apos;s silk .
seriously , what would you do without me ?
yeah .
you know , i gotta tell you , i think
you got a real winner with priya .
yeah , me , too .
she seems really sweet .
believe me , you do not want to take that for granted .
there are a lot of bitches out there .
yeah , bitches are the worst .
all right , i &apos;ll see you later .
uh , penny , there &apos;s something i have to tell you .
what ?
okay , uh , how do i put this ?
um ... are you familiar with darwin &apos;s observation
of the finches in the galapagos islands ?
did they make a movie about it ?
no .
then no .
all right , well , anyway , darwin observed that when two groups
of finches competed over the same food source ,
eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape
so they could feed on something else .
okay .
so what do you think we can learn from that behavior
that we can apply to our own lives ?
uh , a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush ?
sure , that has birds in it .
it &apos;s fun talking to you , leonard ; i always learn stuff .
i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m gonna count that .
do you really have to wear that in bed ?
yeah . the doctor didn &apos;t want me to rub my eye during the night .
it was either this or one of those giant neck cones .
so did you get to talk to penny ?
oh , yes . indeed , i did .
and ?
she completely understood everything i said .
case closed .
was she upset ?
maybe , but that &apos;s not my problem .
she &apos;s not my girlfriend , you are .
i hope you weren &apos;t cruel to her .
is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die ,
or is that just nature &apos;s way ?
leonard ? leonard ? leonard ?
what ? !
i think i figured out wolowitz &apos;s magic trick ,
and i need you to pick a card .
i am not opening that door , sheldon !
as you wish .
pick a card , put it back ,
and prepare to be amazed .
did you pick one ?
yep .
is this your card ?
nope .
drat .
is this your card ?
no .
i &apos;ll be right back .
pick a card , sheldon .
now look at it , and put it back in the deck .
now do you remember your card ?
of course i do , i have an eidetic memory .
my apologies .
now shuffle the cards .
shuffling .
wait here .
processing image , cross @-@ referencing ...
whatcha doin &apos; ?
i &apos;m reverse engineering wolowitz &apos;s magic trick .
what &apos;s up with the infrared cameras ?
i &apos;m measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards
to determine which one &apos;s been touched .
by the way ,
if you hope to have children ,
i suggest you switch from briefs to boxers .
your testicles look a tad warm .
holy crap , are you connected
to the oak ridge national laboratory ?
yes . i &apos;m using their cray supercomputer
to analyze shuffling patterns .
sheldon , that computer is used for national defense .
hacking into it is a federal crime .
relax , we &apos;re not under attack right now .
okay , i &apos;m leaving before the black helicopters get here .
and is this my card ?
rats !
i wonder if howard used a radioactive tracer .
where am i going to find uranium @-@ 235 this time of night ?
come on , craigslist .
is it racist that i took you to an indian restaurant ?
it &apos;s okay , i like indian food .
or as you probably call it back home , &quot; food . &quot;
why didn &apos;t you wear your contacts ?
don &apos;t you like them ?
no , no , i do .
it &apos;s just i knew i was having curry tonight
and i only want one part of my body to burn at a time .
you know ...
... my company offered me a position here in los angeles .
does that mean you &apos;d relocate here permanently ?
maybe . what do you think ?
i love it .
that &apos;s great !
hi !
hi ! just hang on .
small world .
you did talk to her , didn &apos;t you ?
of course , i did . i talked and talked and talked .
hey ! look at leonard in his fancy @-@ ass grownup clothes .
way to go , priya . for once , he doesn &apos;t look
like a mannequin in the boys &apos; department .
hey , did he
tell you i saved the silk shirt ?
no , he did not .
he was gonna throw it in the washing machine
with his spiderman underwear .
that &apos;s our lenny , huh ?
yes , that &apos;s our lenny .
so how &apos;s the food here ?
oh , wow , that is really , really good .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . you guys are on a date .
we can hang out anytime . have fun .
bye . good night .
oh , that &apos;s , hot , hot , hot , hot !
whoo ! i really sneaks up on ya , huh ?
all right , i gotta go .
it is pretty spicy .
oh , i &apos;ve been meaning to tell you ,
i figured out your magic trick .
really ?
oh , yes .
in fact , i improved upon it .
i &apos;d love to see that .
how about you , raj ?
beefaroni &lt; i &gt; and &lt; / i &gt; a show ?
how do you turn that down ?
all right .
pick a card .
okay .
bippity @-@ boppity @-@ boo .
what &apos;s with the wand and the beep ?
the wand is called showmanship ,
and the beep is none of your business .
oh ! excuse me .
i &apos;m getting a text message
completely unrelated to this magic trick .
oh , look , my dry cleaning &apos;s ready .
and your card was the five of spades .
ta @-@ da .
these cards have barcodes on them .
the wand is a reader .
it &apos;s transmitting to your phone .
i said , &quot; ta @-@ da . &quot;
show &apos;s over .
that &apos;s pathetic .
let me show you how a real magician does it .
raj , take a card .
don &apos;t let me see it .
okay .
three of clubs .
son of a gun ,
you &apos;re blowing my mind !
bippity @-@ boppity @-@ boo @-@ yah !
that does it . i &apos;m getting uranium .
you ever gonna tell him ?
maybe . when it stops being fun .
so never .
oh , hey , i was just on my way to work .
oh , okay , its not important .
it can wait .
no , it &apos;s all right . walk me down .
so , what &apos;s up ?
uh , i kind of have a problem
i was hoping you could help me with .
sure , anything .
move out .
what ?
not far .
hey , if you ever wanna start a family ,
la canada has some great schools .
okay , i &apos;m not moving anywhere .
what the hell is this all about ?
why does it have to be about anything ?
can &apos;t a fella ask his buddy to relocate ,
no questions asked ?
oh , for god &apos;s sake , leonard ,
this is about priya , isn &apos;t it ?
she doesn &apos;t want me hanging out with you .
yes . there , i said it .
okay , look .
i happen to like your girlfriend .
and she likes you .
no , she doesn &apos;t .
not really , no .
it doesn &apos;t matter . look , i promise from now on
i will keep my distance from you .
well , now , hold on .
what kind of distance are we talking about ?
because we are neighbors .
i mean , i can hear the toilet flush in your apartment .
you can hear my toilet flush ?
i don &apos;t listen for it , but it &apos;s nice to know
everything &apos;s okay with your plumbing .
the building &apos;s plumbing .
leonard , i get it .
you &apos;re in a new relationship now .
and i &apos;m happy for you .
so why don &apos;t we just shake hands and part friends ?
well , now hold on .
how about this ?
how about we still hang out , but on the down @-@ low ?
are you really that kind of guy ?
no .
i actually felt kinda silly just saying &quot; on the down @-@ low . &quot;
good @-@ bye , leonard .
penny , wait .
damn contacts .
incoming .
hi !
hey !
hello .
why so glum , chum ?
apparently , you can &apos;t hack into a government supercomputer
and then try to buy uranium
without the department of homeland security tattling
to your mother .
oh , that &apos;s too bad .
figure out the magic trick yet ?
figure out the magic trick yet ?
want me to tell you how to do it ?
no .
i &apos;ll show you one more time .
raj ?
hang on .
this time do it with me ,
so i can make sure there &apos;s no monkey business .
all right .
two of hearts .
i hate you .
