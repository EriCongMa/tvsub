daddy .
when i was a child ,
my father was framed for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
amanda .
daddy .
before he died .
who are you ?
nolan ross .
friend of your father &apos;s .
he wanted you to have something .
he left road map for revenge
that led me to the people who destroyed our lifes .
and that is queen victoria .
that &apos;s victoria &apos;s privileged spawn .
i &apos;m daniel .
emily .
jack porter is still carrying a torch for little amanda clarke .
sometimes , the innocent get hurt .
sammy !
amanda clarke no longer exists .
but one by one , the guilty will pay .
you could &apos;ve had anyone ,
and you knew she was my closest friend .
lydia has asked me to announce
that this will be her final weekend in the hamptons .
nothing ever goes exactly as you expect .
it &apos;s your engagement party .
and mistakes are life and death .
mom !
collateral damage is inescapable .
daniel !
go , daniel !
daniel , you have it . you &apos;re almost there .
go , daniel !
go , daniel !
you got it , daniel !
come on , daniel !
go , go , go ! go , daniel !
go , daniel ! go , daniel !
go , daniel ! you have it ! you &apos;re almost there !
take it home !
and he missed it .
... for hampton bay .
that &apos;s gotta hurt .
emily .
what are you doing over here ?
this area is strictly for the commoners .
i like the view .
mm . so i see .
don &apos;t think i didn &apos;t spot you flirting with daniel grayson
at the yacht party last week .
what can i say ?
he &apos;s charming .
he &apos;s dangerous .
come on .
now i assume you have been studying
the hamptons group on my facebook page .
why , is there gonna be a test ?
every bloody day .
welcome to the v.i.p. tent .
for you .
so tell me , who is here ?
oh , come on . white one ?
mm . you must remember him .
nolan ross-- from the memorial day party .
perennial pain in the ass ?
gold star .
and that charmer chatting him up
is bill harmon ,
head of wall street &apos;s most profitable hedge fund .
you &apos;d have to have nolan &apos;s kind of money
for him to even look at you .
ah , and of course ,
situated comfortably in the royalty section ,
we have conrad grayson and ...
her majesty .
class dismissed .
i need to do a little networking .
you &apos;ll be okay , right ?
yeah , of course . yeah . go .
uncle bill !
uncle bill !
hello , birthday girl .
dad , uncle bill &apos;s here .
look what i have here .
happy birthday .
oh ! what &apos;s his name ?
uh , that is up to you .
what &apos;s he look like ?
like a sammy .
sammy . okay .
well , then sammy it is .
thanks , daddy .
david , i gotta talk to you .
yeah , what is it ?
it &apos;s about grayson .
well , it &apos;s so nice to see you .
nice to see you .
declan .
little help , please .
the tables aren &apos;t gonna bus themselves .
i &apos;m on break .
yeah , break &apos;s over . let &apos;s keep the tables turning .
you should have thought of that
before you fired half the staff last week .
don &apos;t be a smart @-@ ass .
stowaway . carl speaking .
yeah , i got the notice .
no , don &apos;t bother . i know what i gotta do .
close up after lunch
and take inventory on everything we got .
what &apos;s going on , dad ?
dad ?
what &apos;s , uh , his problem ?
we &apos;re closing up early .
oh , sweet .
no , declan .
not sweet .
yo . that mean i could borrow the boat ?
whose boat , charlotte ?
a friend &apos;s .
i thought we had all the same friends .
yeah , well , i &apos;m sick of the same .
i want different .
i can do different .
love different .
come on , daniel ! stay on him !
go , daniel !
that &apos;s it , daniel ! go ! that &apos;s it ! you &apos;re on him !
you &apos;re on him , daniel ! go !
another goal for harris .
your boy &apos;s not looking too good out there today , grayson .
mm . it &apos;s not even halftime .
there &apos;s still plenty of game left .
care to back that up with a wager ?
i stopped playing games with you
when i fired you 18 years ago .
i &apos;d say that particular game
worked out pretty well for both of us .
but if you don &apos;t want to throw any more money away
on that son of yours , i can understand .
the only thing you seem to understand , mr. harmon ,
is how to ruin a perfectly good afternoon .
just having a little fun , vic .
tell you what , i &apos;ll even the playing field .
put your money where your mouth is on daniel ,
and i &apos;ll take back the 5 points you &apos;re already down .
i &apos;ll take that bet .
hello again , mr. and mrs. grayson .
ah , ms. thorne . what a pleasant surprise .
you remember emily .
of course , yeah . the girl next door .
oh , not for much longer , i &apos;m afraid .
i understand that lydia and michael &apos;s house
is in multiple offers .
actually , one of those offers is mine .
oh . well , we &apos;re gonna keep our fingers crossed for you .
thanks , but i went in strong .
my realtor is expecting good news .
gotta like a girl who goes after what she wants .
bill harmon .
emily thorne .
you watch your money around this one , young lady .
he &apos;ll take you for every penny if he can .
well , i know a good bet when i see one .
and the first half comes to a close .
we welcome everyone out onto the field
for the traditional stomping of the divots .
ladies and gentlemen , boys and girls ...
and stomp those divots .
i think i &apos;m in the mood to stomp a few divots .
what &apos;s your hurry , party planner ?
nolan , there must be a hundred women here
who would love to play your little games .
i , however , am not one of them .
excuse me .
hello .
hey , it &apos;s jack .
listen , i thought we had a deal on my boat .
other buyers are starting to line up .
ah , the art of the deal .
tell you what ,
i &apos;ll have my business manager
wire whatever you &apos;re asking into your little bank ,
and then we can do the title transfer ,
and blah , blah , blah , whenever it &apos;s convenient .
it &apos;s convenient today .
aye , aye , captain .
see you soon .
you know nolan ross ?
yes , we &apos;ve been close for a long time .
a bit of an odd bird , that one .
i wouldn &apos;t guess he had any real friends at all ,
much less one as lovely as you .
nolan knows when people look at him ,
they see dollar signs ,
so he &apos;s built up a few defense mechanisms .
it &apos;s hard to know who to trust when it comes to money .
couldn &apos;t agree more . so who do you trust ?
with my money ?
myself since 2008 .
i &apos;ve been sitting in cash and short @-@ term bonds
wondering when that second shoe &apos;s gonna drop .
my fund actually made money in 2008 .
really ? well , what do you have , a crystal ball ?
and a magic hat .
bit of free advice ?
the other shoe &apos;s not gonna drop anytime soon .
you should consider getting back into the market .
never said i wasn &apos;t considering .
well , then you and i have a lot to discuss .
call my office .
we &apos;ll set a lunch when you &apos;re ready .
loser pays .
always .
another shocking turn
in the david clarke treason trial came today
as financial advisor bill harmon took the stand
with searing testimony
against his longtime friend and colleague , david carke .
harmon is just one in a long line
of grayson global employees
to detail clarke &apos;s involvement
in the deadly terrorist attack .
easy , girl .
what &apos;s going on with you today ?
off to a rough start , huh ?
i was hoping you wouldn &apos;t be here to see this .
sorry to disappoint you .
if it helps , i made a bet that you &apos;d win .
definitely does not help .
you know , you &apos;re making it
very difficult for me to impress you .
i &apos;m already impressed .
beautiful pony .
thoroughbred mix , about 7 years old ?
you &apos;ve spent some time around horses .
yeah , i was the captain of the equestrian club
my semester in barcelona .
now who &apos;s impressing who ?
would you like to go out sometime ?
riding ?
yeah . riding or ...
just dinner .
win the match , and it &apos;s yes to both .
and if i lose ?
then we &apos;ll see .
come on ...
it looks like you could use a cool drink .
it might take something
a little stronger than lemonade today .
thanks for meeting me , frank .
what were you able to find out ?
about your pretty little neighbor ?
filthy rich and squeaky clean as far as i can tell .
her daddy was a wealthy expat .
gave her enough to bounce around the globe ,
collecting degrees and doing good deeds .
no romantic scandals or divorces ?
nothing stateside .
there &apos;s a few stones left unturned .
i don &apos;t expect much .
why are you so interested in this girl anyway ?
because she &apos;s interested in my son .
need i remind you what happened
with that cocktail waitress
daniel fell for last summer ?
no . i was the one who cleaned up that mess .
i can promise you ,
emily thorne is no cocktail waitress .
i &apos;m not interested in what she &apos;s not .
i want to know who she is .
well , then perhaps you should go straight to the source ...
ask her yourself .
frank , did you know ?
about conrad and lydia .
i &apos;m head of your husband &apos;s security .
of course i knew .
but you kept it a secret from me anyway .
it &apos;s my job to keep secrets .
you of all people should appreciate that .
go , daniel !
come on now !
grayson comes back down the field .
attaboy , daniel !
a super @-@ shot . goal !
wow . there &apos;s some really nice detail here , porter .
i restored every inch of her myself .
well , now that i own her ,
you want to tell me
why you named her &quot; amanda &quot; ?
just a girl i knew once .
that &apos;s it ?
that &apos;s it .
take good care of her , man .
i &apos;d love to . just need someone
to show me the ropes .
wait , wait , wait . you don &apos;t know how to sail ?
i was thinking we might make another arrangement .
unbelievable , man .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m not gonna teach you how to captain my own boat .
oh , well , actually , i &apos;d rather leave
the whole captain thing to you .
what i want is ...
someone to hang out with this summer ,
like ...
gilligan and the skipper ,
except this little buddy
can get you on some killer guest lists .
you &apos;re serious .
why would i want to hang out with you ?
&apos;cause you don &apos;t want to see the &quot; amanda &quot;
on the bottom of the ocean .
go sit down .
hello . anyone in there ?
just a second .
hey . it &apos;s charlotte .
declan .
hey .
everybody .
i hope it &apos;s okay , i brought a few friends .
yeah , i just--
boat &apos;s not big enough ?
the boat &apos;s plenty big .
i &apos;m declan .
i &apos;m charlotte &apos;s boyfriend .
where are all your customers ?
shut down early .
health inspector ?
inventory .
great . then no one oughta miss this .
adam , put that back .
unless , um ...
you think we can get away with it .
you kidding ? i practically run this place .
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s still rum and diet , right , charlotte ?
right .
oh , no . no . you gotta be kidding me .
what &apos;s wrong ?
the boat &apos;s gone .
what do you mean , gone ? like stolen ?
i don &apos;t know . it should be here .
my brother said he was going to the bank .
come on , man . pick up .
what a joke .
we &apos;re wasting our time .
you coming ?
sorry .
&quot; my dear amanda ,
the worst betrayals always come
from the ones we trust the most .
if i &apos;m at all culpable for what happened to us ,
it &apos;s because i gave away my trust too easily . &quot;
it &apos;s a good age . not a worry in the world .
well , she &apos;s growing up without a mom .
that &apos;s a worry .
last i checked ,
you were working on a plan to change that with victoria .
what &apos;s going on , bill ?
i &apos;m in trouble , david .
you remember the greenville merger ?
yeah , you made a killing on that .
i had a mole on the board of directors .
my god , bill .
tell me you &apos;re joking .
i knew that merger was coming .
the s.e.c. gets ahold of this ,
you &apos;re going to jail , bill .
grayson &apos;s security seized my database this morning .
frank called me .
grayson wants to cut a deal .
what kind of deal ?
any kind of deal he wants .
grayson &apos;s holding all the cards .
you and david clarke worked closely together .
did you consider yourself friends ?
i thought we were , yes .
and when did that change ?
when i discovered that he had been using
inside information to make illegal trades .
after i turned him in ,
i found out he &apos;d been laundering money as well .
and what was the name of the organization
you believe david clarke was laundering money for ?
americon initiative .
the same americon initiative
that claimed the responsibility
of blowing up flight 197 last summer ?
yes .
hello ?
is this emily ?
yes , it is .
emily , this is victoria grayson .
i took a chance and dialed the number
i had for lydia &apos;s old landline .
i hope i haven &apos;t disturbed you .
no , not at all .
i wanted to invite you over to the house tomorrow for tea .
is that something you think you might be able to do ?
yes , that sounds lovely .
good . i think it &apos;s time you and i get to know each other
a little bit better .
i &apos;m looking forward to it .
till then .
if you invest your money with grayson ,
you &apos;re definitely gonna see a return . that &apos;s a guarantee .
i came up through the ranks there ,
so i know how they work .
grayson &apos;s gone soft over the years .
i still believe in making big trades when it &apos;s warranted .
valerie thomas ,
emily thorne .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
so bottom line--
you &apos;re young ,
you &apos;re sitting on a huge pile of lazy assets .
now is the time you should be taking
some calculated risks .
i &apos;m not afraid of taking risks , mr. harmon .
i just need to know that you &apos;re not rolling the dice blind .
still need proof of that crystal ball , huh ?
for your eyes only .
these are real returns of our top @-@ tier investors
of the last five years .
now that &apos;s double @-@ digit gains across the board .
this ...
could be you .
that &apos;s incredible .
can i get a copy ?
a good magician never reveals his secrets .
we provide the highest level of confidentiality to our clients .
it &apos;s vital to the health of the hedge .
a courtesy you can also expect
should you decide to come aboard .
well ...
you &apos;ve given me a lot to think about .
ms. davis .
thanks for picking me up
on the street corner like a prostitute .
yeah , all right . don &apos;t send anyone through
for the next half @-@ hour , sharon .
well , i &apos;ll return calls when i &apos;m back at the office .
so you do still return calls ?
lydia , i understand , you &apos;re upset .
i &apos;m not upset .
i &apos;m ruined .
what &apos;s this ?
michael &apos;s attorney presented these to the judge .
and they triggered the fidelity clause in our prenup .
i get nothing .
the beach house , my jewelry ,
the damn dog ...
everything is gone .
i am sorry , lydia .
really , i @-@ i am , but ...
what can i do about it ?
you can write me a check .
a big one .
this is emily .
emily , it &apos;s karen
with kellar house real estate .
i &apos;m afraid i have some bad news .
the beach house sold to someone else .
what ?
who ?
where the hell you been all day ?
there &apos;s a ton of work to do around here .
you really screwed me , you know that ?
i promised a girl i &apos;d take her sailing .
yeah , that &apos;s why i asked if i could borrow the boat .
okay . well , i &apos;m sorry
i couldn &apos;t accommodate your joyride .
you &apos;ll just have to find another way to impress her .
what is your problem ?
you and dad have been acting like such tools lately .
are you really that blind to what &apos;s going on ?
dad &apos;s broke .
i sold the boat
to keep this albatross going .
is that true ?
cancel that transaction .
it &apos;s too late , pop .
the bank already applied the sale to your loan .
th @-@ then we &apos;ll buy it back .
with what ?
all of our assets are right here in this room .
dad , i &apos;m trying to save this place for you .
nobody asked you to do that , jack !
i &apos;m the captain of this family , not you .
jack , i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t know .
well ...
now you do .
拒绝接听
hello , jack .
i &apos;m trying to book my next sailing expedition .
but you are making it very difficult .
i told you , if you got in my way ,
i would take you down .
you stole my house .
if i hadn &apos;t , victoria would have .
she outbid you with a cash offer this morning .
how could you have possibly known that ?
&apos;cause i hacked the realtor &apos;s computer .
i &apos;ve been tracking the sale all week .
victoria outbid you ,
so i outbid her .
why is it so important
for you to be a part of this ?
when i met your dad ,
i &apos;d already been laughed out of every boardroom
in new york .
i was an mit misfit
with a vision that nobody got but him .
the only reason nolcorp exists
is because your father gave me cash from his personal account
to develop it .
and that &apos;s because he believed in me .
i want the deed to the house .
it &apos;s already in your name .
consider it a ...
birthday gift
for amanda .
tomorrow is the big day , isn &apos;t it ?
daniel mentioned that you were captain
of an equestrian team in barcelona .
uh , yes , just for a semester .
oh . when was that , exactly ?
2005 .
why do you ask ?
i rode steeplechase
when i was in boarding school at montpelier .
i &apos;m curious what else we have in common .
what are some of your other interests ?
history for one .
i &apos;m practically obsessed with it .
funny .
at my yacht party , you were more
concerned with current events it seemed .
art conservation
is another one of my passions .
that &apos;s why i joined new york &apos;s landmark preservation society .
my father always said
that our past defines who we are .
i would say our choices are what define us .
maybe for the lucky .
but sometimes in life , we &apos;re not always given a choice .
emily ?
hi .
hi . what &apos;s going on ?
well , your mother invited me over for tea .
daniel , for god sake , pull yourself together .
you &apos;re a sweaty brute .
my apologies .
had i known my mother had summoned you ,
i &apos;d have looked at least 50 % less brutish .
no , it &apos;s fine .
i should get going , really .
i have to work out some issues with my realtor .
things got a little aggressive ...
in our bidding war today .
oh , i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
will you be on the hunt for a fallback rental ,
or are you headed back to the city ?
actually , as of this e @-@ mail ,
i &apos;ve just become the official new owner
of the beach house .
that &apos;s great news . congratulations .
thank you .
now how about i make good on that date
and take you out to celebrate ?
that sounds great . how about tomorrow ?
yeah , tomorrow &apos;s perfect . i know just the place .
come on . i &apos;ll walk you out .
thank you so much for tea , mrs. grayson .
i can &apos;t tell you how much i &apos;ve enjoyed this .
oh , man .
i wish i could &apos;ve seen the look on victoria &apos;s face .
and don &apos;t say it was priceless ,
because that was bought and paid for , baby .
i &apos;ll get you your money back .
no , no , no , keep it .
we &apos;ll write it off as an initiation fee
into our little club .
it &apos;s not a club , nolan .
and we are not partners . do you understand me ?
yeah , sure .
call it whatever you want .
i &apos;m just happy to be here ....
coach .
bill harmon ?
what do you need me to do ?
you just did it . now go .
i must say , it was a nice surprise ,
hearing from you again so quickly .
what can i say ? you made a great case .
and you made a great decision .
i will personally see to it that your portfolio
reflects all the effort and wisdom
that went into building my company .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m counting on .
where your money is , my money is .
you want to make an adjustment in how you &apos;re leveraged ,
i &apos;ll talk you through it .
and if , for any special reason ,
you want to go big on a particular stock ,
i &apos;ll make sure it &apos;s worth your while .
actually , now that you mention it ,
what can you tell me about allcom cellular ?
chinese smart phone manufacturer .
not really huge in the global market ,
but i wouldn &apos;t count &apos; em out down the road .
why ?
i want to get in with them , today .
today .
any particular reason ?
little bird may have whispered something .
thank you .
i &apos;ll wire the funds this afternoon ,
and we can deal with the whole
portfolio transfer next week .
sounds good .
hey , pop . you doing all right ?
the bottle was half @-@ empty when i started .
okay . well , i &apos;ll be sure to make note of that in the inventory .
a young man shouldn &apos;t have to give up on his dreams
because his old man can &apos;t run a business .
i haven &apos;t given up on anything , dad .
and neither should you .
you know , when your mother left ,
it all went to hell , didn &apos;t it ?
you must be so ashamed of me .
dad , i &apos;m not ... ashamed of you .
i &apos;m proud of you .
you &apos;ve kept this place afloat against all odds .
we &apos;re gonna make it through this .
we &apos;re gonna come out on top , like we always have .
you know what ? you &apos;re right .
tomorrow will be better .
you bet it will .
i was just thinking about tonight .
oh , yeah ? what were you thinking ?
how do you feel about surprises ?
tonight ? pretty good .
great , then i won &apos;t say anymore .
i &apos;ll pick you up at 6 : 00 .
how should i dress ?
surprise me .
does she suspect anything ?
not a thing .
in other financial news ,
wall street is buzzing with rumors
that allcom cellular is now a front @-@ runner
for an exclusive contract with innovative chip maker nolcorp .
nolan ross , the notoriously cagey
c.e.o ... and founder has promised ...
emily , bill harmon .
listen , that little bird that whispered allcom ...
it wouldn &apos;t happen to be the gentleman i saw you
hugging outside the cafe this morning ?
well , i &apos;m not saying that it was and i &apos;m not saying that it wasn &apos;t ,
but what i will say ... is that i trust that little bird enough
to double my position .
that &apos;s all i need to know .
we &apos;re going all in on allcom .
get the big dogs in it .
you &apos;re sure ?
yeah . yeah , make the trade .
everyone in on allcom , people .
buy up everything they &apos;re selling .
everything , now .
... a fortune 500 company
with nolan being named one of the richest men in the world .
he &apos;s known for a brazen attitude
and a take @-@ no @-@ prisoners leadership style ,
and nolcorp and ross continue
to push the boundaries of cellular technology .
we take you now , live , to nolan ross
and that announcement , as promised .
listen to this , valerie .
greetings , earthlings .
nolan ross here with what was supposed to
be a surprise announcement about the future of nolcorp ,
but someone somewhere has a big mouth .
i can now confirm that the allcom rumors
came from a woefully misguided employee .
allcom is dead to me
and will not be receiving the contract .
what ? no .
instead , i &apos;ve decided to offer our humble services ...
no .
to allcom &apos;s soon @-@ to @-@ be chief competitor , unitech .
well , there you have it .
expect unitech to open huge tomorrow ,
and for those of you who bet big on allcom cellular ,
get ready to cover some equally heavy losses .
everybody , listen up .
if you value your jobs , keep your mouths shut .
as far as our investors are concerned ,
it &apos;s just another sunshiny day .
word of this leaks , we &apos;re finished .
hello , this is valerie calling from bill harmon &apos;s office .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve got some bad news
regarding a major stock loss today
and its immediate effect on your portfolio .
please call the office as soon as you can .
i have the information you requested on emily thorne .
well , what is this , a big &quot; i told you so &quot; ?
it was going to be
until i printed out a roster of active board members
of the new york landmark preservation society .
this is a roll call from february .
and there &apos;s emily , just like she said .
and there &apos;s michael davis .
lydia &apos;s husband ?
you remember the rumor that
michael was sleeping with a young lady this spring ?
here &apos;s another roll call from march .
neither are present .
coincidence ?
it &apos;s leaked .
all our investors are pulling out .
we &apos;re finished .
how do you want to deal with what &apos;s happening downstairs ?
who &apos;s downstairs ?
everyone .
ten well whiskey ,
and then , uh , we got eight gin ,
12 rum .
we &apos;re close .
it &apos;s nolan !
oh , thanks .
what &apos;s up , nolan ?
what &apos;s up is , you never return my calls .
i &apos;ve been a little busy .
doesn &apos;t look like it .
ah , hey , sport .
you &apos;re the guy who bought the boat .
proud new papa .
you know he only sold it to you
to pay off the lien on my dad &apos;s bar ?
no . i did not know that .
so you being around right now
probably isn &apos;t the best thing for him .
i get that a lot .
still closed , nolan .
yeah , i know .
hey , so ...
what &apos;s say you and i hit up
a little party i caught wind of tonight ?
i &apos;m sorry , gilligan . w @-@ we &apos;re done hanging out .
well , what if i said
i &apos;d give you your boat back at the end of the season ?
what &apos;s he talking about ?
wait , wait , wait .
you &apos;re--you &apos;re saying that if i pretend to be your friend ,
you &apos;ll give me my boat back , free and clear ?
well , see , it &apos;d be better if you didn &apos;t ... have to pretend ,
but , uh , that &apos;s the gist ,
um , plus , all the cool parties .
oh , he &apos;s in .
dec--
what ? that &apos;s a hell of a deal .
come on , and if anyone could use a night off , it &apos;s you .
i got it handled here .
he &apos;s got it handled .
yeah .
how come we never go to your house ?
adam , stop .
you &apos;re all sticky and sandy .
so let &apos;s go rinse off .
we &apos;re supposed to be on a break , remember ?
and whose bad idea was that ?
charlotte , is that you ?
adam , go .
go .
please go .
okay . okay .
what is it , mom ?

i hope my mother wasn &apos;t too hard on you the other day .
i don &apos;t scare too easily .
does she interrogate all of your dates ?
yeah .
my mom &apos;s not really a hands @-@ off kind of person .
well , at least she got rid of her lie detector .
kidding . she &apos;ll never get rid of that thing .
hope you &apos;re not planning on becoming a comedian .
maybe in my next life .
my future is pretty well mapped out this time around .
one more year at harvard business ,
then it &apos;s straight to the boardroom .
wouldn &apos;t be surprised if my dad
already has an office picked out for me .
that sounds ...
i know how it sounds .
what about your parents ?
mom , um ...
caring , smart ,
and my dad , just very ... special .
lovely people .
so i shouldn &apos;t expect an interrogation ?
they passed away when i was a kid .
car crash .
i &apos;m so sorry .
do you have any brothers or sisters ?
just me .
well , you and that beautiful beach house .
maybe you can set down some roots of your own now .
yeah , maybe .
want to come by for the tour ?
i &apos;m ready when you are .
so how does it feel to know you &apos;ll be
spending the night in your own home ?
it &apos;s kind of hard to describe , actually .
i had a really good time tonight .
me , too .
sam .
sammy .
no , no , no . no , no . come on .
sorry .
we early or are we late ?
surprise !
welcome to the hamptons , emily .

i &apos;m so sorry , ems .
&quot; how to ruin a perfect first date , &quot;
by ashley davenport .
no , no , this is great .
it &apos;s just , i &apos;m not big on surprises .
lesson learned .
whatever you do , don &apos;t take it out on daniel .
i practically had to force him into doing this .
speaking of surprises , i am pretty sure
that dog was not on the guest list .
oh , no , no . sammy .
and neither is the hottie that he came with .
surprise .
what do you think you &apos;re doing , bringing jack here ?
jack and i are friends .
you don &apos;t have friends .
neither one of us can afford them . you know that .
speak for yourself .
you betrayed me .
i thought we had an understanding .
oh , so did i.
i know it was you who went to the press .
i just can &apos;t understand why you &apos;d leak the wrong info
when you had access to the nolcorp memos .
you knew i was going with unitech .
yes , but bill harmon didn &apos;t .
he bet big on allcom .
$ 2 billion of his funds &apos; assets
down the drain .
after a financially fatal move in the market today ,
harmon investments founder
bill harmon was swarmed by a mob
of angry investors outside of his office ...
this evening ,
we expect the imminent collapse of harmon investments
and major personal losses for har--
he &apos;s ruined .
right there .
what can i do for you guys ?
you can stay away from charlotte for starters .
come on !
emily thorne .
i swear to god , i &apos;m not stalking you .
though i &apos;m not sure the same could be said for my dog .
congratulations on the ...
on the house .
thank you .
i hope you &apos;re not planning on aring it down
and building yourself something like that .
oh , no . no , not at all .
this ... this house stays exactly the same .
good .
it &apos;s nice to know there &apos;s somebody else out there
with an appreciation for--for history .
this place sure has a lot of it .
anyway , um ...
i &apos;ll let you get back to your party .
if you see nolan ,
just let him know i split .
yeah , no problem .
it &apos;s nice to see you again .
sammy .
now who are you gonna stay away from ?
i @-@ i can &apos;t ...
what &apos;s that ? i can &apos;t hear you ?
your mother .
you &apos;re a dead man .
get outta here . come on . let &apos;s get outta here .
go ! go ! go !
stay on your own side of the economy ,
you little dock rat .
hey ! get away from him !
hey , dec.
dec , who are those guys ?
no one .
let me help you up .
you &apos;re drunk .
oh , and you &apos;re beat to hell .
but they &apos;ll get what &apos;s comin &apos; to them .
yeah , i know .
yeah , they &apos;ll get girls and they &apos;ll get cars ,
they &apos;ll get more money than they can spend .
you know what i &apos;m gonna get ? crap .
&apos;cause i &apos;m a loser , dad , just like you .
declan , listen ...
victoria , it &apos;s frank .
i found an anomaly in emily thorne &apos;s public record .
what kind of anomaly ?
from ages 16 to 18,
it &apos;s like she didn &apos;t exist .
every piece of information you &apos;d expect to find on her
was sealed by the court .
i want you to start following her .
i want to know everywhere she goes .
i want to know everyone she sees .
something &apos;s not right here . i can feel it .
bye , emily .
bye .
&quot; where we love is home--
home that our feet may leave , but not our hearts . &quot;
oliver wendell holmes .
maybe i should &apos;ve been a poet .
well , maybe you still can be .
good night .
good night .
trust is a difficult thing ,
whether it &apos;s finding the right people to trust ...
or trusting the right people will do the wrong thing .
dad !
oh , god .
no , no .
no , no , dad .
oh , god . no , no .
no , no .
declan !
jack , what do i do ?
call 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
okay .
go !
we need help .
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know . he &apos;s not breathing .
but trusting your heart ...
is the riskiest thing of all .
i only have a few minutes .
bill harmon knows about us .
i think he &apos;s gonna tell conrad .
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand . how did this happen ?
i trusted the wrong person .
in the end ,
the only person we can truly trust
is ourself .
happy birthday , amanda .
we &apos;re close .
it &apos;s nolan !
oh , thanks .
what &apos;s up , nolan ?
what &apos;s up is , you never return my calls .
i &apos;ve been a little busy .
doesn &apos;t look like it .
ah , hey , sport .
you &apos;re the guy who bought the boat .
proud new papa .
you know he only sold it to you
to pay off the lien on my dad &apos;s bar ?
no . i did not know that .
so you being around right now
probably isn &apos;t the best thing for him .
i get that a lot .
still closed , nolan .
yeah , i know .
hey , so ...
