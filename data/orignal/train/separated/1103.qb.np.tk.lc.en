the mri confirmed pra partial tear of pretty the rotator cuff .
what about swimming ?
there &apos;s a possibility of surgery .
the outcome is unpredictable .
so ? unpredictable can be good .
itthe gun-- at least i think it is .
that gun was used to kill detective wilden ,
and your mother &apos;s fingerprints are on the bullets .
we entered a plea of not guilty ,
but the judge refused to grant bail .
i &apos;m gonna confess to killing detective wilden .
you &apos;re gonna help me .
suppose i &apos;m the one who actually set up your mother .
who are you ?
beckett frye .
why are you here ?
discovery in the marin case .
do you know what &apos;s in there ?
that is about wilden and radley and toby &apos;s mom .
what did the doctor say about your eyes ?
i &apos;ll have good days and bad days .
on your darkest days you know i &apos;ll be here for you .
i &apos;m not a saint .
just because a man has been ordained ...
if you &apos;re scared and you need help ,
i &apos;m here for you , without any complications .
i &apos;d like to speak to a detective .
mona vanderwaal is at the police station .
she just walked in and confessed to killing wilden .
why did you kill detective wilden ?
i already told you . it was self @-@ defense .
then tell me about it again .
he grabbed me .
he was gonna kill me . i fought back .
and you pulled out a gun and shot him three times .
no . for the fifth time , i shot him twice .
what did you hear wilden say at the halloween party ?
he was worried that garrett was gonna tell the truth
about what happened the night alison died .
garrett was killed on the train ,
so why didn &apos;t you go to the police ?
i was afraid i was gonna get into trouble .
i had snuck out of radley that night .
you snuck out of a mental institution .
many times .
look ...
wilden was obsessed with
trying to pin alison &apos;s murder on my friends .
so you tried to blackmail him .
yes .
but it didn &apos;t work .
once he realized i knew he killed garrett ,
he became enraged .
and he wouldn &apos;t let go .
he left me with no choice .
i had to kill him .
you could have gotten away with this .
why confess now ?
i can &apos;t let my best friend &apos;s mom
go down for a murder she didn &apos;t commit .
i &apos;ll be right back .
hey . where were you ?
i went back to the station to see what i could find out .
and ?
apparently after we left last night ,
mona made a full confession .
did you girls put her up to this
thinking it would somehow help ashley ?
of course not .
mon , we would never do anything that stupid .
i knew mona was devious , but this is beyond anything
i ever thought she was capable of .
what makes you so sure that she didn &apos;t do it ?
things she said in her confession
contradict some of the evidence .
do you have any idea why mona would do this ?
no . no , honest .
i hope not ,
because if you girls are involved in any way ,
it will really hurt your mother &apos;s case .
please tell me you had nothing to do with this .
hanan was planning of doing what ?
why didn &apos;t she tell us of all this last night ?
i don &apos;t--
no . no , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m still here .
i &apos;m on my way , spence , i just--
i had to say bye to jake .
well , after everything that happened last night ,
i didn &apos;t want to stay alone .
my dad &apos;s still in syracuse .
what ? no .
he slept on my couch .
see you soon .
hey . was that about mona ?
oh . no , there &apos;s ... still no update .
that was spencer . i have to go meet her .
now ?
i thought we could grab some breakfast at the grille .
you know , i &apos;d really love to ,
but she &apos;s helping me cram for this history test , so ...
okay . well , can &apos;t do anything without a little caffeine , right ?
we could stop by the brew on your way over .
my treat .
okay , you slept on my couch . it &apos;s my treat .
i don &apos;t know what to think .
well , i totally believe mona could have done it .
hello ? she ran hanna over with a car .
i just can &apos;t help but feel
that mona &apos;s gonna somehow drag us into this .
can we take a mona break for like two seconds
and talk about your birthday ?
it &apos;s not until tomorrow .
who knows , by then i could be wearing an orange jumpsuit .
well , then we need to make tonight extra @-@ special .
i got the key to my aunt &apos;s lake house .
how about a quite night , just the two of us ?
what &apos;s this ?
an early birthday gift .
dominic trains a lot of division one swimmers .
yeah , and a few gold medalists , too .
i made an appointment for you
to meet with him in philly this afternoon .
today ? why ?
because i want you to know what your options are .
paige , i have an injury . i can &apos;t swim .
right now . but no one said you could never swim again .
or that you have to go to college next year .
my mom and i are looking at three colleges next weekend .
state schools that you don &apos;t really want to go to .
or ...
you could take a year off .
and train . and spend the next four years doing what you love
with the person that you love .
you &apos;ll meet with him , right ?
yeah .
thanks .
so , uh , is your dad coming home tonight ?
i just--i just want to make sure you &apos;re not home alone again .
uh , yeah , he gets back in this afternoon .
we &apos;re gonna have a family movie night tonight .
i wanted you to be the first to know i got into grad school .
i &apos;m finally gonna get my masters in education .
great .
yeah , it &apos;s not columbia teachers college ,
but it &apos;s still a really great program
and they offered me a stipend
if i teach one class .
thanks .
all right , well , i should probably go .
but thank you much again for last night .
anytime .
uh , bye .
i mean , university of washington is in the top ten .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry , did you say university of washington ?
yeah .
as in seattle , washington ?
yeah . i know it &apos;s not ideal .
well , ideal would be in this area code .
it &apos;s the only school that offered me money .
you &apos;re still gonna see malcolm , ezra ,
just not every day .
you mean not most days .
you &apos;ll have the summers off , and he &apos;ll have breaks too .
i need to do this . it &apos;s important for my future .
and malcolm &apos;s .
nobody confesses to a murder they didn &apos;t commit .
i think mona was just trying to help .
you send care packages
with fresh soap and new underwear if you want to help ;
you don &apos;t volunteer to spend your life in prison .
whatever mona was trying to do ,
she certainly got judge reilly &apos;s attention .
what do you mean ?
i just received an email .
not only are you not being transferred ,
but mona &apos;s confession created enough doubt
that she &apos;s finally agreed to set bail for you .
they--they dropped the charges ?
no , not unless they find something
to corroborate her confession .
so the trial is still moving forward .
as of now , yes . but at least you can wait for it
from your own home .
there is one more thing .
since wilden was a police officer ,
the bail is set higher than usual .
how high ?
a million dollars .
so that &apos;s the full tour .
the pool is amazing .
i mean , your facilities are really outstanding .
five minutes . then i want you changed and hitting the weights .
there &apos;s no slackin &apos; here .
i can see that .
everyone &apos;s in great shape .
please .
so your friend mentioned you were thinking of
holding off college for a year to train .
uh , i &apos;m considering it .
please , have a seat .
let me tell you a little about how i run things .
we work out six days a week .
four hours in the pool , one hour of weight training .
i also monitor what you eat , drink , and how much you sleep .
have i scared you yet ?
no . no , i &apos;ve worked really hard the last four years ,
both with the team and on my own .
that &apos;s great , but there &apos;s a big difference
between being a top high school swimmer
and a championship swimmer .
i know the difference .
let &apos;s have a look at your recruiting video .
dad , i know it &apos;s a lot of money ,
but you only have to put up ten percent of the million dollars .
you &apos;ve seen where she is ! we can &apos;t leave her in there !
well , try harder .
hanna ?
you all right ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
i left you a few messages .
yeah , i know .
it &apos;s just with everything going on ...
of course . i understand .
i think about your mom all the time .
i mean , i wish there was something i could do to help her .
she acts like she can handle being in there .
but i know she &apos;s trying to put up a front to protect me .
she &apos;s a strong woman , hanna . she &apos;ll get through this .
well , i don &apos;t know if i will .
they can leave her in there forever ,
and it doesn &apos;t look like my dad &apos;s
gonna come up with a hundred grand anytime soon .
what do you need that kind of money for ?
it &apos;s what she needs to post bail .
caleb &apos;s trying to sell his car ,
but it &apos;s not gonna be nearly enough .
you need to have faith things will work out .
okay ?
i don &apos;t need faith .
i need money .
how long are you gonna be gone for ?
shouldn &apos;t take me more
than four or five days to find an apartment .
i already have a few leads .
maybe malcolm could stay here with me .
that way he doesn &apos;t miss any school .
i &apos;m looking at tickets for a saturday ,
so it &apos;ll only be a day or two .
i &apos;d really prefer if he didn &apos;t miss any .
i &apos;ll drop him off here on my way to the airport .
thank you .
have you talked to him about moving yet ?
not yet .
it &apos;s not gonna be easy for him , leaving rosewood .
he &apos;s really comfortable here .
he &apos;s a really tough kid . he &apos;ll adapt .
you &apos;re gonna be so busy with school ,
and he &apos;s not gonna know anybody out there .
he &apos;s good at making new friends .
he could always stay here with me .
i mean , i have more free time than you .
i &apos;m not gonna leave my son behind , ezra .
he needs to be with his mother .
and it &apos;s equally important for him to spend time with his father .
yes , but i &apos;m the one who &apos;s
been there for him for the past seven years .
and whose fault is that ?
you know , i think it &apos;s best malcolm comes with me next weekend .
i &apos;ll talk to his teachers ,
make sure he doesn &apos;t miss any assignments .
hanna &apos;s convinced mona did all this
as a way to right all the wrongs .
when has mona ever done anything
out of the goodness of her heart ?
what heart ?
she told the police that we bullied her once .
she could do it again .
what , like we forced her to confess ?
yeah .
and she still has that picture that &quot; a &quot; sent
of the four of us standing outside of wilden &apos;s car that night .
yeah , but mona was there , too .
not according to the picture .
check it out .
you took this ?
yeah , i took it at a meet last year .
she &apos;s gonna love it .
okay , we should go .
i told paige we &apos;d be at her aunt &apos;s house in like 20 minutes .
with everything that &apos;s going on ,
i still don &apos;t understand why she &apos;s throwing this party .
emily &apos;s been living like a refugee for days now .
i think paige just thought she at least deserved a piece of cake .
shana , they know i &apos;m hiding something .
if the cops really thought that ,
you &apos;d still be there answering questions .
i should have told them about alison .
it &apos;s too dangerous .
it &apos;s too dangerous not to say anything at this point !
just give me a little more time to figure out where she is .
i don &apos;t have much time left .
i &apos;m not leaving your side
until i take you back to philly in the morning . okay ?
this &apos;ll all be over soon .
promise .
your mother has a guardian angel .
my bail was posted anonymously .
i guess that &apos;s how your dad got around isabelle .
well , at least he did it .
okay , so what do you want to do first ?
you wanna take a bath ? do you wanna eat ?
i got all your favorites .
what &apos;s that ?
that ...
tracks where i am .
every second of the day .
it &apos;ll beep like that once in a while
when it links to the satellite , but you &apos;ll get used to it .
yeah . i assure you it &apos;s not something i &apos;m gonna get used to .
just remember , you can &apos;t leave the house
unless it &apos;s for a court date or a medical appointment .
you think this thing will detect a sip of chardonnay ?
that thing will detect a whif of chardonnay .
look , i know that these rules are upsetting ,
but it &apos;s better than the alternative , right ?
this is true .
veronica , thank you for everything .
you &apos;re welcome .
try to relax , get some sleep .
i &apos;ll call you tomorrow , okay ?
okay .
should we call dad and thank him ?
after we eat .
i haven &apos;t had a decent meal in days .
you didn &apos;t get a tattoo while you were in there , did you ?
you &apos;re pulling too much water .
and that flip toe is too far from the wall .
i won this race . it was actually my best time all season .
you &apos;ve got some bad habits
and your technique could use some improvement .
but you got a lot of potential .
if you &apos;re willing to commit , i can help you .
really ?
yes .
but we need to start right away .
we &apos;re already behind .
yeah , just as soon as my shoulder heals .
heals ?
paige didn &apos;t tell you ?
i tore my rotator cuff a few weeks ago .
i might need surgery .
emily , with an injury like that , i wouldn &apos;t put you in the pool
for at least six months .
that &apos;s even if you don &apos;t have surgery .
but you can still help me , right ?
after losing that much time ,
i can &apos;t promise that
you &apos;ll be ready for next year &apos;s scholarships .
oh . what do you think the odds are ?
slim .
at best .
emily , i &apos;m sorry .
had your friend told me how serious the injury was ,
i could have saved you the trip down here .
yeah .
am i crazy , or did it sound
like jenna was saying she knows alison &apos;s alive ?
that or she knows who killed her .
either way , this could lead to &quot; a &quot;
and who &apos;s setting up hanna &apos;s mom .
yeah , but jenna &apos;s not just gonna tell us .
well , she might if we could pry her away from shana .
jenna &apos;s really vulnerable right now ,
and not just because she &apos;s losing her sight again .
how does that even happen , anyway ?
one minute you have it , the next minute , poof , it &apos;s gone ?
well , toby said that that
operation has a really low success rate ,
so apparently she &apos;s one of the unfortunate ones .
hey , has toby had any luck in new york ?
he traced that number back to an empty apartment ,
and the landlord said that it was rented out to a girl .
he wouldn &apos;t give the name , but he did give a forwarding address .
to where ?
a p.o. box in philly .
he &apos;s on his way back from new york right now .
guys , em &apos;s gonna be here at 6 : 30 .
we gotta hurry up .
oh , did you invite the whole swim team ?
yeah . but don &apos;t worry , shana won &apos;t show up .
i made it clear she was unwelcome .
could you call her and make it unclear ?
we kind of need her to come .
why ?
because until tomorrow morning ,
wherever shana goes , jenna goes .
so sorry to bother you at home with this .
don &apos;t be . i understand how upsetting this is .
now , i know a lot of family lawyers , but greg is the best .
do you think i have a chance ?
it &apos;s not my area of expertise ,
but i know it won &apos;t be easy .
why is that ?
for one , you haven &apos;t been involved in your son &apos;s life
until recently .
that &apos;s because i didn &apos;t know he existed until recently .
and two , you aren &apos;t listed
as the father on his birth certificate .
so what are you saying ,
that i don &apos;t have any rights ?
not until you establish paternity .
but greg can help you with that .
can he help me prevent maggie from moving to seattle ?
it &apos;s possible ... but it &apos;ll be a battle .
one that will take time and money
and be an emotional strain on you and maggie .
are you sure you want to pursue this ?
i &apos;m sure .
no , no , they &apos;re not here yet ,
but i &apos;ll text you when they show up , okay ?
and give your mom a &quot; welcome home &quot; hug for me . bye .
where &apos;s spencer ?
um , i don &apos;t know .
last time i saw her she was trying to stop tommy hayes
from power @-@ dipping the guacamole .
help me get everybody hidden ?
emily just texted she &apos;ll be here in a minute .
yeah , of course . okay , you guys , let &apos;s go hide .
she &apos;s almost here . everybody . we get back .
okay , guys .
she &apos;s here . everybody get ready .
somebody get the lights .
hey , birthday girl .
everything okay ?
why did you lie to dominic ?
surprise ! ! !
hi ! happy birthday !
hey , paige , i thought you might want to know
that bridget woo is in your kitchen .
she &apos;s trying to make a bong out of your aunt &apos;s teapot .
so , did you know paige was gonna plan all this ?
no . she &apos;s been full of surprises lately .
yeah , well i &apos;ve got another one for you .
jenna &apos;s back , and she &apos;s knocking into walls .
ted . hi .
hi .
how did you know i was home ?
word travels fast in rosewood .
i just wanted to stop by , welcome you back .
you brought pie .
thank you .
i tried visiting you , but they wouldn &apos;t let me in .
they were honoring my request . i didn &apos;t want to see anyone .
i was ashamed .
you shouldn &apos;t be .
you didn &apos;t deserve to go through this .
the thought of you being in there is ...
look , i know you have a lot of catching up to do with hanna ,
but when you settle in , i &apos;d love to take you to dinner .
it &apos;ll have to be in my kitchen .
how do you like my new accessory ?
anything looks good on you .
do you want to stay for some pie ?
sure .
paige said that coach fulton was gonna be here .
i have to show my face . i need to stay on her good side .
it was hard enough coming back to this town in the first place ,
and now i have to be around them ?
and me .
i &apos;ll be with you the whole time .
we &apos;ll be in and out .
hey . are you okay ?
yeah .
no .
jake &apos;s here .
i lied to him about what i was doing tonight .
ooh . well , where is he ?
he &apos;s over there with that blond with giraffe legs .
i don &apos;t even recognize her . who that ?
she &apos;s on the swim team .
they certainly look cozy .
yeah , she &apos;s trying real hard .
clearly he &apos;s enjoying it . look at him .
why don &apos;t you go over there and talk to him ?
what ? and interrupt the flirt fest ? no .
um , are you forgetting that he spent last night on your couch ?
yeah , but he came to the party with her .
i thought you weren &apos;t that into him .
i &apos;m not .
they &apos;re here .
why didn &apos;t you tell dominic i was injured ?
i wanted to make sure he &apos;d see you .
you know ...
for a minute there i actually thought
maybe this could happen for me .
maybe things could go back to the way they were .
if he won &apos;t train you , we can find someone who will .
he &apos;ll train me .
he just doesn &apos;t think i &apos;ll be ready in time to get a scholarship .
we can get another opinion .
why are you pushing this so much ?
i know how badly you want to swim .
or you mean how badly you want me to swim ?
what do you think is gonna happen
if i don &apos;t go to stanford with you ?
three thousand miles is a long way .
four years is a long time .
a lot can happen .
we have to face facts .
we &apos;re not gonna be together next year .
is your coach here ?
not yet .
wow , look who &apos;s back in town .
it &apos;s nice to see you , jenna .
aria . spencer .
are you having problems with your eyes again ?
i see everything that i need to .
is there something you guys want ?
yeah , we &apos;re getting the team together for a photo for emily .
so can you come outside ?
when everyone else is there , we &apos;ll come out .
okay .
cool .
you keep an eye on them and i &apos;ll get everybody outside .
okay .
well , if you must know ...
hey , dad . i don &apos;t know if you got my earlier text ,
but i just want to thank you again for helping mom .
so call me back when you get this .
i love you . bye .
i &apos;ve been calling you all day . are you okay ?
i will be .
i can &apos;t believe they let you go .
they need proof , hanna , before they can arrest me .
people make false confessions all the time .
mona , why did you do this ?
sorry , i can &apos;t chat .
i &apos;m not supposed to be on the phone .
i just wanted to make sure your mom got out on bail .
yeah . yeah , she &apos;s home , but ...
you &apos;re welcome .
jake .
family movie night , huh ?
look , ya know ,
with everything that &apos;s going on ,
i totally spaced about emily &apos;s party .
yeah , all right . you don &apos;t have to lie .
no , i didn &apos;t lie .
it &apos;s not like you had to invite me . we &apos;re not dating .
it completely slipped my mind . honestly .
so ... who &apos;s barbarella over there ?
name &apos;s kim .
she &apos;s pretty .
if you &apos;re into the tall , statuesque model type .
you okay ?
yeah . i &apos;m perfect .
looks like the two of you have been having a great time together .
wait . so you don &apos;t want me to go the party with you ,
but you don &apos;t want me to go with anyone else ?
i didn &apos;t say that . you &apos;re not jealous ?
why would i be ? we &apos;re not dating .
yeah , right .
we &apos;re just friends .
i ... need to go find spencer .
yeah , i ...
should get back to kim .
there &apos;s a lot of people who came to see you here tonight .
think you can back inside
and at least pretend to have a good time ?
yeah . i can do that .
we &apos;ve been here for over half an hour .
can we please leave ?
i haven &apos;t seen coach yet .
your teammates can tell her that you stopped by . please ?
please .
yeah .
okay . let &apos;s go .
jenna . i need to talk to you before you leave .
alone .
about what ?
alison .
jenna , let &apos;s go .
i heard you talking about her at school today .
you were spying on us ?
we &apos;re out of here .
jenna , wait .
look , i know exactly how you feel about me ,
but ali was best friend ,
so if you know anything about her ,
you have to tell me .
i don &apos;t have to tell you anything .
time for cake !
jenna , wait !
that was delicious . did you make that yourself ?
with some divine intervention . belmont bakery .
you wash , i &apos;ll dry ?
you know , i &apos;m actually looking forward to doing both .
i should get going . let you get some rest .
well , before you do , i think i owe you an explanation .
you don &apos;t owe me anything .
i want to explain .
wilden and i had a history .
i did some things i &apos;m not proud of .
things ... he knew about , and he ...
he tried to use them to hurt me and hanna .
he was a corrupt cop , ashley .
i saw him ... the night he was murdered .
we had an argument .
i know you didn &apos;t kill him .
no , i didn &apos;t . but--
i could have .
everyone has their limits .
can i drop off dinner for you and hanna tomorrow night ?
only if you stay and eat with us .
it &apos;s a date .
okay .
oh . um , just do me a favor .
don &apos;t run . i &apos;ve got a lot riding on you .
hey , have you seen spencer ?
yeah , she went outside to look for jenna .
i &apos;ll come with you .
okay .
spencer ?
hi .
hey .
are you headin &apos; out already ?
yeah . gotta get up early tomorrow .
where &apos;s kim ?
inside . saying goodbye to a couple of people .
she &apos;ll be out in a minute .
awesome .
oh , my god !
what is it ?
spencer ! ! !
oh , my god !
jenna .
jenna ! oh , my god !
i thought she was inside !
what happened ?
yeah , go inside !
get a phone !
she &apos;s not breathing !
somebody call 911 !
she can barely see . there &apos;s no way
she &apos;d walked all the way to the lake on her own .
did somebody push her in ?
i think somebody hit her first .
there was blood on the back of her head .
what ? is she gonna be okay ?
what hospital did they take her to ?
i gotta go . i &apos;ll call you in the morning .
hey . who you talkin &apos; to so late ?
oh . i was just wishing emily happy birthday .
listen , i just got off the phone with your father .
i thought you should know : he didn &apos;t put up the bail money .
it was ted .
ted .
wow . he must ... really like you
to put up that kind of money .
i guess so .
so what &apos;s gonna happen next ?
we can think about that tomorrow .
i still can &apos;t believe
you were the one who saved jenna marshall .
who would do this to her ?
we don &apos;t know anyone did for sure .
she had a gash on the back of her head , paige .
she could have fallen in , hit her head on a rock .
i think someone wanted to make sure
we didn &apos;t find out what she knows about alison .
thanks for coming over .
thanks .
i keep thinking if emily had pulled that girl out
just a couple of seconds later ,
she probably wouldn &apos;t be here .
i knew your life was complicated ,
but i didn &apos;t know it was anything like this .
i &apos;ve had a long history with mona and jenna .
if i explained everything ,
we &apos;d be here till i graduated .
i &apos;m starting to see why you &apos;re so on edge all the time .
i feel safe when i &apos;m with you , though .
and i &apos;m sorry if i ruined your night or anything .
kim &apos;s just a friend , aria .
look , i was really glad when you stayed over , and ...
yeah , i was pretty jealous tonight .
i @-@ i just--i don &apos;t see how i
can involve anyone else in my life right now ,
it &apos;s like i &apos;m either spinning in circles
or i &apos;m in a constant state of free @-@ fall .
maybe you can let someone else help you navigate for a while .
see what happens .
okay , yeah .
maybe i could .
ya know , and see what happens .
so on a scale from one to ten ,
how jealous were you tonight ?
emily .
em , are you asleep ?
hey . have you seen toby ?
he &apos;s with his parents , talking to the doctor .
i &apos;m waiting to see her . she &apos;s still not conscious .
hey . who did this to her ?
all i know is nothing good
every comes from being around you four .
please . shana--
you could be next .
or me .
was it ali ?
alison ? she &apos;s dead .
well , then who jenna so afraid of ?
shana !
cece drake .
