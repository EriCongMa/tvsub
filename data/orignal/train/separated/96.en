Previously on The Good Wife...
Neil Gross.
I'm CEO of Chumhum.
Chumhum is a worldwide company,
like Yahoo, Google, Facebook;
they do business in Canada, Mexico, China.
Peter Florrick has offered me
the vacated Illinois Supreme Court seat
if he wins the governorship.
I'm in.
With Agos/Florrick?
Florrick/Agos.
Look, we can't keep skulking around.
We have to cut the cord at some point.
People want to wait for bonuses.
Our client, Mr. Marwat,
was a translator in Afghanistan.
His daughter was dying from dysentery.
I brought him medicine, that's all.
I took it to his home in Badula Qulp.
Hi.
Hey, it's me.
I can't believe Jim. He was acting so weird.
I know. What's all that Middle Eastern stuff
he was talking about?
Have you seen Team America?
It's so cool. I saw it last night.
"Dinka Dinka Jihad Jihad Dinka..."
How about when they say "Weapons..."
I should probably be there about ten, 15 minutes.
This sewer kind of smells.
It smells like sarin gas or something like that.
So I'm thinking...
Yeah, I went to Taliban down the street.
The cover charge is just outrageous. I mean...
So, I'm doing a Chumhum search on Al-Qaeda,
and I started thinking, you think this puts me on a list...

Diane Lockhart
Hey, I need a translation.
I need a translation.
Is it a new call?
No, it's two years old.
Then send it downstairs.
They mentioned one of the Lockhart/Gardner lawyers.
It's two years old.
Some of us are working present-day here, okay?
I understand, but I think...
Well, next time. I'm sure...
I can't believe he said that.
What's wrong, David?
The fourth-years have stopped.
They've stopped texting each other.
That's good news, isn't it?
No. It means they've been warned.
Please. I have an appointment with the governor,
and Will is here.
You wanted to read their texts and there are no texts.
Take good news as good news.
The absence of bad news is not good news.
Okay, David, I have to go.
Hey, Alicia, where are you?
I think in reception.
It's big. Where am I going?
I'm coming to you.
$25 a square foot?
I know.
You like it?
I think it's... A real law firm.
Yeah.
Let me show you your office, it's right here.
No, no, it's over here.
Funny.
Oh, hey, everyone, thank Alicia for the heads-up on the phones.
Bought burners for everybody.
Only use the company phones for Lockhart/Gardner calls.
It's... Will.
Hey. Shh. Quiet down.
Hey, Will.
Alicia, we have a scheduling problem here. Where are you?
Lunch.
When can you get back?
Diane's heading out to a meeting on her judgeship,
and I can't take the Chumhum meeting,
Neil Gross hates me.
I thought Cary was taking that meeting.
He is. It's just... they want a partner there, too.
Mr. Gross has expressed some concern
about Cary being up to the job.
We just want the best.
Sure, I'll be there.
Bye.
What was that?
Will... wants me in the Chumhum meeting.
Why?
He wants a partner there.
Cary, you're sure Chumhum is coming with us when we leave?
Yeah. Why? What did he say?
Nothing. I just...
Due diligence.
If Chumhum doesn't come with us,
we don't have a firm.
I know.
We're fine, Alicia.
I'm in touch with Neil Gross every day.
Don't worry, he's coming.
All I want to do is speak the truth,
and I want to tell our users how little
my company's cooperated with these NSA subpoenas.
We know, and we're going...
Oh, and the NSA has asked us
over and over to provide user information
from our social networking sites.
Over and over and over--
I can't tell you how much we've pushed back.
Actually, yes, I know, Barney,
I can't tell you how much we've pushed back,
because according to this gag order, if I do tell you,
I will spend the next five years in prison.
Could we get a copy of that, sir?
My users think I have sent every text
and personal e-mail over to the United States Government.
This gag order prevents me from denying it,
so what do I do?
Well, first good thing you did is come to us.
Good. I'm a good boy. So now what?
Sue them.
Sue who?
The National Security Agency.
Sue them for what?
Anything.
The whole point is to look like they're gagging you,
that you are the injured party.
Sue them with anything. Great.
That gains more billable hours for you,
and for me gains nothing.
Sue them for prior restraint.
What does that mean?
Well, the government can't ban the expression
of an idea prior to its publication.
That's exactly what they're doing here--
stopping you from speaking with this gag order.
You have the same rights as The New York Times.
And it'll also help if we can get
other social networking sites on board--
Yahoo, Google, Sleuthway.
They're all in town for TechWeek.
We get them to sign on to an amicus brief
in support of your claim.
Okay. Good. Do it.
Excellent job.
Thank you.
Hey, Kalinda.
We need help on this Chumhum case.
We're suing the NSA.
Okay, what do you need from me?
Well, TechWeek is in town...
Hey. They're suing us.
What?
The law firm, Lockhart/Gardner,
they're suing us.
You and me?
No. The NSA.
Yeah, take that one to the Systems Admin.
Check out the link I just sent you.
You have $1.3 million.
Now, many advisors would suggest stocks.
Uh, I tend to advise interest-bearing bonds.
My second husband always advised against bonds.
Really? And how long were you married to him?
Have you ever been married, Mr. Liebenbaum?
Uh, I have not.
But, then, I have an excuse: I'm selfish.
You know what you are, Mr. Liebenbaum?
Hmm?
You're a carnivore.
You're a jungle cat.
Well, it's a dangerous place here on the savannah.
The cat survives.
Mom. Hi.
Oh, hi, darling. How are you?
Good, Mom. I...
What are you doing here?
David and I are running off together.
Ha-ha. We're estate planning.
I was advising bonds.
Ah. Uh, Mom, could you come by my office...
Um, h-hold on.
I'll be right back.
Can you talk? We have a problem.
Not yet. Hold on.
Okay, what's the problem?
We don't have the office space.
What do you mean? We put down earnest money.
I know. And the bank loan was supposed to come through
to make up the difference,
but the bank wanted to talk to our current employers.
Will and Diane?
Yeah. And we couldn't let them talk to them.
Uh, Mom, I'll be right out.
No, I'll just wait here. Go ahead.
How did that happen?
I don't know. John made some assumptions.
But now we need $140,000,
or we're out the earnest money.
The $60,000 we already put down?
Yeah. It sucks.
Mom.
It's better by the door.
So now we need to get the full amount.
Cary... I don't have $140,000.
Do you have any way to get it?
This is really wrong, Cary.
I put up $10,000 of my own money
for that earnest money.
I know. I did, too...
Hey. We're up.
It's the Marwat warrant.
FISA court warrant 30-879.
Danny Marwat.
He's an Arab-American translator
who worked for the military
until he was accused of collaborating with the Taliban.
He hired the law firm
Lockhart/Gardner to defend him.
So that's why we're following all these lawyers?
Just two lawyers:
Alicia Florrick and Diane Lockhart.
And we've only gone back two years in the bit bucket.
So we have a warrant for this person of interest, Marwat,
he hires two lawyers and we've
been listening to their calls for two years.
I don't see the problem.
Well, these lawyers also represent Chumhum.
Yeah. This firm's all over the map.
The problem is, they're suing us.
These lawyers are?
Yeah. But not for Marwat.
For Chumhum.
Okay, don't do that again.
So, you want to know whether...
does our warrant restrict listening to a law firm
in active litigation with us for a non-terroristic action?
Sometimes I can't tell if you're the stupidest people
in the world or the smartest.
We're the smartest.
Okay, I'll check with counsel,
and in the meantime, if anyone refers to this Chumhum suit,
mark it down as a possible omit.
Thank you, sir.
We respect you greatly, sir.
Hey, have any of these lawyers done anything illegal?
Not yet.
I mean, not glaringly yet.
Uh, the one lawyer, Florrick,
her husband's about to be governor of Illinois.
What?
Yeah, in about a month.
Alicia's wondering what to wear to the inaugural.
All right, keep an eye on this.
We can direct Justice to illegality these days.
Maybe this case can prove its worth in another way.
Any illegality?
Any illegality.
By the governor?
By anyone.
You're the smartest people in the world,
don't limit yourselves.
Real hostile energy.
Well, I've wrapped
a three-iron around a tree many a time, so...
So... do you think you can get behind this, Chief Justice?
This?
Diane Lockhart's nomination
for the Supreme Court seat.
We'd like to announce tonight. If that's possible.
How did you like my gift, Mr. Governor-elect?
"Fiat Justitia Ruat Caelum"
The engraved gavel. He loved it.
It was supposed to be back here today, sir.
We are having it mounted.
Yeah, I'm gonna hang it on the wall there.
Words to live by.
"Fiat Justitia Ruat Caelum."
"Let justice be done though the heavens fall"
It's beautiful.
Okay, so, Diane Lockhart?
We'd like you to attend a press conference tonight.
Diane Lockhart is a perfectly charming woman
with an unobjectionably appropriate resume,
who, when I met her,
took every opportunity to defend
her perfectly corrupt legal partner.
And you'd like her to...?
Explain herself.
Publicly.
I want to know why her firm
still represents Chicago's top drug dealer.
I want to know
how she disagrees with her disbarred partner.
I want what you want, sir.
"Fiat Justitia Ruat.."
Oh, this is such idiotic crap.
You don't want her because you're a sexist old fool.
Eli!
And you are a rude backroom huckster.
But that is irrelevant to this.
Chief Justice,
Diane Lockhart is my choice.
It is so good to see you, sir.
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.
How nice to...
Chief Justice...
No, no, no, don't get up.
What do you want to do?
Well, we can't lose him.
It'll cost us too much politically.
I'll tell Diane we're delaying.
See if you can give him what he wants, for God's sakes.
Done.
What about this gift? This gavel?
Have you lost it?
No.
It's probably in the gift room with the other 900 presents.
I'll make sure it's out here the next time you see him.
Mounted.
Mm-hmm.
It's a gold-plated gavel
given to the governor by the chief justice, with Latin on it.
Mr. Gold, remember Damian the intern?
No.
The one in the Hawaiian shirt?
Oh, yes, the one I fired.
What?
Well, he was in here, in the gift room,
and I'm just guessing...
He took it?
I just checked on Clarkswap, and look.
890美元
Call him, arrange a meeting.
Don't say who it is.
Just say I'm interested, and I want to inspect it.
So any word from Google?
No.
Yahoo?
No.
Facebook?
No.
Is this 20 questions, Kalinda?
No.
So... Sleuthway, Patric Edelstein?
Yes.
Ah.
Edelstein will support our amicus brief?
No.
Kalinda... what do you have?
Clearly you have something,
because I can see the file under your arm.
When are you leaving?
To start our own firm?
Soon. Why?
Well, you're putting me in an awkward position.
It's not my intent.
You intend on taking Neil Gross
and Chumhum with you as clients, right?
You're improving your position
at the expense of Lockhart/Gardner.
No.
I'm doing my job as a lawyer at Lockhart/Gardner.
Kalinda, what do you have?
Something for Lockhart/Gardner,
not Agos & Associates.
Kalinda, this is a Lockhart/Gardner case.
Any money derived from it stays at Lockhart/Gardner,
so whatever you have helps Lockhart/Gardner.
You have to change your strategy.
Yes, yes.
I heard your argument,
and I was mightily impressed, but no.
Prior restraint doesn't apply here.
The Second Circuit has ruled
that NSA subpoenas are legal,
and gag orders are required for national security.
That ruling wasn't precedential, Your Honor.
Oh, yes, it was, and you want to know why?
Because I just said so.
So, if there's no other business before this court...
Just-- excuse me,
Your Honor, just one more matter.
What might...? I know you.
You were just in here last week.
Yes.
Good to see you again.
Lovely to see you.
What, you're the only lawyer in town?
No. We just had so much fun last time,
we thought we'd do it again.
Actually, Counselor,
I'm the one who makes the jokes here, not you.
Apologies, Your Honor.
Your Honor,
we'd like to change our suit to one of selective enforcement.
Your Honor, is the plaintiff really accusing
the United States of selectively enforcing its gag order?
We are, and we'd like to call a witness.
Tingles, Counselor... tingles.
Patric Edelstein.
I'm CEO of the social networking site Sleuthway.
And you were just served a subpoena at TechWeek today?
Yes.
Thank you, Neil.
Uh, what is the size of Sleuthway, Mr. Edelstein?
The size?
900 million users, and growing.
And you have been served with FISA warrants
to grant access to your users' e-mails
and chatting functions, isn't that...
Objection, Your Honor. All discussions of
hypothetical FISA court warrants are,
in fact, classified and cannot be discussed here.
As Kafkaesque as that sounds, I will sustain.
Have you ever
been served with a gag order regarding the NSA's requests--
sorry-- hypothetical requests for access to users' data?
No.
Thank you, sir.
Sorry.
That was just preamble.
We can do so much with technology,
and yet, when I was served with a warrant, I caved.
We gave the NSA e-mails, data, phone calls.
Not that many. Less than a hundred.
But still, we gave it to them.
Rip into him.
Definitely.
So that was you, right?
Yes.
And you were discussing the extent
of your cooperation with the NSA?
Do you mind voicing your answer?
Yes, I was.
And did you receive
a cease and desist letter from the NSA after that talk?
No.
Were you warned of your gag order
either before or after that talk?
No.
Were there NSA recruiters in the audience of that talk?
Okay, okay, okay.
I get it.
Selective enforcement.
And I'm prone to let this suit go forward,
unless the government has something up its sleeve.
We request a recess, Your Honor.
Of course you do.
What time did you say?
3 o'clock. He's late.
You're not gonna make a scene, are you, Mr. Gold?
No, I'm gonna get my gavel back
and scare the hell out of Mr. Hawaiian Shirt.
I'm not gonna...
What? What's wrong?
Oh, Mr. Gold. Hello.
I should have known.
I'm not as fast as I used to be.
Oh. I see.
You're my Clarkswap contact.
You can go now, Deborah.
She seems a little young for you, Mr. Gold.
So, Zach took the gavel home,
you stole it, and now you're selling it?
No. I am selling it, for $890.
I found it at the flea market under a stack of old pottery.
It's amazing
what you can find at the flea market these days.
And it's just a coincidence
you found the gavel belonging to the father of your boyfriend?
Zach's not my boyfriend.
I'm in college now.
I don't really have time for high school seniors.
Becca, I work for the governor now.
I'm his chief of staff.
Congratulations.
You can't steal from the governor.
You'll be arrested.
Excuse me, Mr. Gold.
That'll be $890.
Oh, no, no, dear Becca.
My gift to you is you not being arrested.
No, Mr. Gold.
Only one of us is taking something they haven't paid for.
Excuse me, officer?
Hello.
Yeah?
Could you help me out?
I-I'm a student here,
and this man is trying to take one of my father's antiques,
and he won't pay me for it.
Are you serious?
Officer, uh, my name is Eli Gold...
Sir, are you a student here?
Peter and I have a problem, Alicia.
And it's going to become my problem, Eli?
Uh, I mean, yes.
It's about Zach's girlfriend, Becca.
Hey, Frick and Frack, let's go.
And so, our question is,
does this lawsuit change anything,
or can we continue our surveillance?
Last time a person of interest
contacted these lawyers was two years ago?
You mean Danny Marwat? Yes.
And you're a two-hop warrant?
Yup. We can go from Marwat to his lawyer
to his lawyer's contacts, that's all.
And this has taken you to the governor-elect of Illinois?
Well, yeah, but we're not actively pursuing him.
Doesn't matter.
You're going into the governor's mansion,
you need a more recent terrorist connection.
Get it to me in 36 hours,
and we'll take it to the FISA court.
Wait, wait. That's not why we brought this to you.
It was about the lawsuit.
I don't have any issue with the lawsuit.
My issue is taking a two-hop programmatic warrant into
the governor's mansion.
Thank Edward Snowden.
Everybody's cracking down now.
Why do you guys care?
Move on to one of your other cases.
I don't know. We were getting interested.
Well, then find a more recent terrorist connection.
Okay, here we are.
We're back together. What do you have, Bobby?
Bobby? Bobby, I intend to move this suit forward,
unless you guys got something.
We do, Your Honor.
We request a very brief SCIF.
Uh, excuse me, Your Honor.
A what?
Scif. S-c-I-f.
Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility.
For the communication of classified information.
This is really necessary, Counselor?
It is, Your Honor.
The matter is quite sensitive.
Okay.
I have no choice but to move this into the courthouse's SCIF.
Uh, excuse me, Your Honor.
Plaintiff's counsel doesn't have
security clearance for this SCIF.
Excuse me?
The data to be imparted is highly classified,
and it requires a security clearance
only available to His Honor.
Your Honor, the AUSA cannot just determine who can...
Your Honor, this is ridiculous! This is not a FISA court!
Okay, okay, okay!
I know you're outraged, but he's right.
You don't have security clearance.
You have to wait in court.
We have a problem you can help us with.
We need you to do a Chicago Law interview tomorrow.
An interview?
Really? On, uh, what subject?
Your work here.
Putting your career in perspective.
Your excitement at being considered for the judgeship.
The interviewer is Mandy Post.
She's good.
She won't sabotage you.
Why do I feel another shoe is about to drop?
You need to put the past behind you, Diane.
And how do I do that?
There will be questions about Will.
His disbarment.
Is this from the chief justice?
Yes.
He won't stand behind my nomination
unless I declare my antipathy to Will?
No.
Not to Will. To his past behavior.
Oh.
Eli, has... any other nominee
ever been asked to disavow his or her past?
Not that I know of.
And what happens if I don't?
Peter really needs you to get the chief justice on your side.
So I trash Will or I'm not nominated?
No.
Trash his past.
Oh, of course.
This is insane. We can't just...
After a discussion in SCIF with AUSA Hortense,
I rule...
for the government.
Uh, excuse me, Your Honor, that's crazy.
You haven't even heard our rebuttal.
What rebuttal?
You weren't even privy to the government's argument.
That's because we were left out here.
All right, now listen to me.
If you are arguing, Mrs. Florrick,
that this is absurd, I'll agree with you.
But if you are arguing that this is illegal, unfortunately
you are wrong.
Lawsuit based on selective enforcement is denied.
Court is adjourned.
I'm pissed.
Good. Use it.
I just don't understand.
You said you didn't want to see anyone.
Nisa, listen to me. I'm not seeing Becca.
You have to stop calling.
Who's Nisa?
Zach's old girlfriend.
Oh, that cute little black girl. I liked her.
You're not supposed to say "Black."
It's "African-American."
But I guess she's Somalian, so I don't know.
Somalian? Wow.
What are you guys doing?
We bought clothes. Some very, very pretty clothes.
Mom's not gonna like that.
Oh, sure she is.
She wore this kind of thing in high school.
Except it had rips in it.
Her father said it looked like a young man's rape fantasy.
Wouldn't let her wear it.
But she found a way.
How'd she find a way?
She put them in my car and changed on the way to school.
Now, makeup. You're gonna want to wear more than you should.
What happened to Christian Grace?
Thought you were religious.
I'm just getting stuff for school.
Now, now. Jesus has no problem with Grace looking her best.
That's what Jesus believed in.
Here.
That's Nisa.
I'm letting it ring.
Is anyone answering the phone?
It's Nisa; we're letting it ring.
Oh, hey, Mom. How was shopping?
Oh, so much fun.
Grace got three dresses.
You know she wears a uniform; she doesn't need dresses.
Well, she does for dances.
Am I going to approve of these?
They're perfectly appropriate evening attire for a young lady.
I'm gonna start drinking.
Pour me one, too.
Hey, Cary.
Any thoughts on Chumhum?
Not yet.
But thanks so much. This is... this is incredible.
Uh, what's incredible?
Your check.
My check?
That I wrote for the $60,000 contribution?
No, your check for $140,000.
We got the offices, and you will get
first out with interest from all the other partners.
Cary, I didn't give you a check.
You did. Yeah, the envelope, it's from you.
Okay, what-what's the name on the check?
It's a... A trust. Ivy Road Trust.
Alicia.
Where do you keep your earrings?
Look, I heard you on the phone, and I wanted to help.
But, Mom, that's a lot of money.
Oh, I know it is. It's my money, I want to spend it.
But you're... This is crazy.
Yeah, consider it a loan.
If you pay me back in six months, I won't come after you.
Mom... what's this about?
Why does everything have to be about something?
Can't someone just be nice?
Okay, if it makes you feel better,
you have to have dinner with me.
I've met someone.
Who?
Michael Barnwright. Very nice widower.
Retired.
He used to race dogs.
Okay, good. Dinner.
Okay, next adventure.
Mom, I'm not seeing Becca.
Look, it's about the governor's mansion.
People are going to want things from you.
And not even big things.
Little things like this gavel.
Why does everybody think I'm seeing Becca?
I haven't seen her since she went off to college.
Mom, I told her that I never wanted to see her again.
Then how did she get Dad's gavel from the apartment?
What's wrong with this blush?
That is not even blush.
That is grandma blush.
Throw it away.
For your skin, you need a skin illuminator.
Obviously, you are aware of the rumors
floating around that you are next in line
for State Supreme Court.
If I had a dollar for every time I've been rumored for something.
But right now, I'm just trying to run my law practice.
Coming out of bankruptcy helped.
Yes, definitely.
It wasn't just bankruptcy, was it?
I mean, you were also dealing with the suspension of a name partner.
Yes, um...
that was a... tough period for us.
But we got through it.
And you kept Will Gardner's name on the letterhead.
Was there ever any thought to taking it off?
I, um... I won't say the question never came up,
but, um... here we are.
You don't sound thrilled about it.
Wasn't it almost disbarment?
Will Gardner's suspension, I mean.
I'm probably not the best person to ask about that.
So you don't harbor any resentment at your partner
for almost single-handedly destroying your firm?
Our firm.
Correction. Your firm.
Will Gardner single-handedly
won five of this firm's top awards.
He's the reason we survived bankruptcy.
By bending the law?
By using it.
By understanding its limits and its complications.
And by using everything he can, within the law,
to win cases.
Really?
Yes.
Oh, wait.
I didn't even turn this on.
Silly me.
Shall we start over again?
Okay, now what?
My West Coast lawyers are suggesting
that it was mistake to try this
in the Midwest from your offices.
Your West Coast lawyers are saying this?
Really?
Oh, what do you think, Ben?
This kid thinks he can take you.
The Seventh Circuit is very sympathetic to business issues.
And it was our mistake
to take a constitutional argument to them.
When you lose with the Constitution, try money.
Okay. And how do we do that?
Interference with prospective economic gain, Your Honor.
Really?
The government is interfering with
Mr. Gross's economic gain by...?
Ruining his company's good name with his customers.
Your Honor, the Federal Tort Claims Act...
Specifically allows for suits for damages against the government.
Not if the government employees in question
were acting in a discretionary capacity.
Then produce someone from the NSA, so we can ask them
if they were acting in a discretionary capacity.
Got you there, Bobby.
Your Honor, I have to request we go back into the SCIF.
Mm, no, no, Counselor.
This isn't about national security; this is about money.
What damages is Chumhum claiming?
$3 billion.
What?
That's the amount of stock value Chumhum has lost
due to its forced association with the NSA.
Okay.
We'll hear testimony tomorrow.
Hey, Mom.
Where's your date?
He isn't coming.
Margarita?
Is everything all right?
No.
He's going back to his wife.
I thought you said he was a widower.
He was.
I guess she didn't die.
Oh, come on. Have a margarita. Let's get drunk.
Maybe your good mood will rub off on me.
Oh, Mom, I'm so sorry.
No, no, no.
The worst thing in the world is to have someone feel sorry for you.
You remember that?
I used to do that to you when you were five.
I know. And I didn't understand it then.
You know what I don't understand about you?
Why I ever divorced your father?
No. I mean... yeah.
But we'll save that for another time.
You never liked me as a kid.
I mean, you like my kids now, but...
but you never really liked me.
I liked you.
No.
We never did anything together.
I think you liked Owen.
And I was a likable kid.
People liked me.
God... if we could just start over,
do everything just all over again from the beginning.
Me, too. I think we'd be better at it now.
Don't make me cry.
I'm the one who should be crying. I'm alone.
Oh, Mom. Oh...
Okay. Okay.
That's enough.
So you blame the NSA for losing you 20% of your user base?
Yes.
And there was no other reason for the loss of so many users?
Not in such sizable amounts.
And on what date did you see the beginning of this...
"Sizable" Loss of users?
Well, I would trace it to the Edward Snowden leak around June 10.
Thank you, Mr. Gross. No further questions.
I'd like to call Simon Fishbein.
Simon Fishbein?
Who's that, your podiatrist?
I'm Simon Fishbein.
Oh, yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
Nice to meet you. Would you please join us?
You were once a user
of Mr. Gross's networking site, Mr. Fishbein?
I was. It was a good way of keeping up with my grandkids.
Ten grandkids and three great-grandkids.
Each generation is having fewer and fewer kids.
Have you noticed?
Oh, I have, sir.
But you quit Chumhum?
Why is that, Mr. Fishbein?
They allowed Holocaust deniers to organize on their site.
And why is that a problem for you?
Well...
Let the record reflect that Mr. Fishbein has just exhibited
a numbered tattoo from Auschwitz.
Now, you're not the only camp survivor to be offended
by these Holocaust denier pages, are you?
No, there's a group of us. We meet every month at Manny's.
We sent a letter to this putz here, Gross.
Your parents should be ashamed of you.
Mr. Fishbein, I'm sorry, but it's free speech.
We don't take down objectionable content...
You forced a breast-feeding support group to take down
a page that had instructional photographs...
There's no cross-talk.
So, did anything come of your writing Mr. Gross?
We got a nice letter back--
they spelled my name wrong.
But they didn't take down the pages.
So we contacted the Zionist Defense Council,
and they organized a boycott.
And when was that boycott organized?
June 10.
The same day Mr. Gross pointed to his losing users.
So we can't really be sure why users are leaving Chumhum.
Objection. Counselor is testifying.
All right, I'll give it to you. Have fun with it.
Sustained.
Thoughts?
I don't understand.
I didn't do it.
Oh, that part I understand.
What I don't understand is why.
She kept fishing.
It was like she wanted me to sell Will out.
Yes, people fish because the fish are biting.
Everyone knows about Will's troubles.
He's my partner.
We built this firm together.
I mean, that means something.
I hope it means everything,
because that's what you've traded it for.
I want to be on the court, Eli, of course I do,
but I can't betray Will, not like that.
Hardly matters now.
What's done is done.
Where are you going?
To put together a short list for the Supreme Court.
North Korea?
Yeah. Apparently, the U.S. Government
is investigating Neil Gross because he had a meeting
with some North Korean nationals in Seoul last year.
And how do we know this?
One of Robyn's contacts at the Treasury.
So that's why he's being singled out
and not Edelstein or any of the others?
Looks like that.
The man never ceases to amaze me.
It was a pro-democracy group.
North Korean dissidents, they wanted us to help them
with, uh, equipment-- cell phones, encryption software.
Civilians or government officials?
Some of both. Why?
Because if they were government officials,
they can get you under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
You know, it was the good guys I was talking to,
the ones who were against Kim Jong-un.
Maybe you can argue that in court.
What is your problem?
Clearly, I don't have one.
I was trying to help the North Koreans until they backed out.
Why'd they back out?
'Cause they were afraid of the NSA,
the same as everybody else.
Did you give them this technology for free?
At-at cost.
But they were supposed to pay you?
Yeah. Why?
Because if they were supposed to pay you,
then you have damages.
Sorry.
David, can this wait? I'm in a meeting.
It's about your mother, you tell me.
I'm concerned about her.
I know, it surprises me, too.
I think she's making investment decisions
without understanding the consequences.
What do you mean?
Well, I got off the phone with her broker just now.
She wrote a check for $140,000,
and he doesn't know what it's about.
You wouldn't have any idea what it's about?
No idea.
Because I looked up the check online.
As her advisor, I have access to her account.
It was written out
to a Threshold Commercial Realty here in Chicago.
She's probably making an investment.
I told her real estate is a bad idea.
Well... she's coming in in a minute. We'll talk.
Uh, she's coming in today?
Yes, in a few minutes.
Come on, Mom.
Mom. Where are you?
I'm in the car; coming to your offices to see David.
Yes. David's gonna ask you about the check you wrote for me,
and I need you to tell him that it's an investment.
It is an investment.
No. But it can't be an investment for me.
You can't...
Hey, did you find something?
I don't know.
Another terrorist connection?
I went back to the metadata.
Forget it. I already did; there's nothing there.
No, no. This is from yesterday.
12 calls from
a Hamas sympathizer on the BOLO list.
You're kidding.
To who, Diane Lockhart?
No. Alicia Florrick.
It must be a client.
No. 12 calls to her home.
Left messages on her machine.
A Somali national.
What is that?
It's, uh, Taiwanese porn.
Real sick stuff.
Teo Dalmar.
He's a financial supporter of the Muharib Muslim.
What was his call about?
I don't know.
Sounds like...
crying?
Any further witnesses, Mrs. Florrick?
Actually, Your Honor,
we ask to be heard in a SCIF.
You ask to be heard in a SCIF?
Yes. We have information of a delicate matter
that may prejudice our client with the government.
Objection, Your Honor. The SCIF exists
to protect the government, not...
The people, Mr. Hortense?
Well, yes, Your Honor.
Whatever protections
the government enjoys, people should enjoy as well,
don't you think, Mr. Hortense?
Overruled.
North Korean dissidents?
Freedom fighters, Your Honor.
Due to their association with the NSA,
Chumhum has lost the contract
to supply these freedom fighters with cell phones.
And other technologies.
That's why we asked to be heard in here, Your Honor.
Since Mr. Gross had the temerity
to question the NSA's gag order,
we were afraid the government may seize on any excuse to prosecute him.
Even his attempts to spread democracy in North Korea.
Mm, heaven forfend.
So just how much was this technology contract worth?
With the freedom fighters?
Yes.
It's $14,000, Your Honor.
$14,000?
Yeah.
That's not quite as impressive as $3 billion.
We would argue the nature of this intrusion into our liberties...
Save it, Mrs. Florrick.
We both know it's not about our liberties,
and it's not about the money, either.
It's about the publicity value of Neil Gross
standing up to the NSA.
Okay, let's get going. I've made my decision,
and no one is gonna like it.
$140,000?
I know.
It was a spontaneous investment.
I'm kooky that way.
It's a suite of offices?
Yes.
A very beautiful suite of offices.
When I saw it, I just had to have it.
You did?
Yeah. Gorgeous.
It's just that the commercial real estate market is so depressed,
it's not the best time.
Well... you know how I am.
I'm just a real girl with money.
Well, I can call the realtor and get out of it;
we'll put the money toward a stronger investment...
No, no, no. I'm good.
I mean, once I'm committed, I'm committed.
That's me.
A-Are you sure? Veronica, it's a lot of money...
David.
Don't do this.
It's my money.
I invested it.
I'm good.
Okay?
Okay.
So, appreciating the government's legitimate
national security concerns, I'm gonna find
that the NSA's gag order should remain in place.
However,
appreciating the legitimate
free enterprise concerns of Mr. Gross,
I also find that Chumhum has been damaged
in the amount of... $14,000.
Uh, $14,000?
Mm-hmm. That's what I said, Bobby.
$14,000. You better call the General Accounting Office;
it may take them a while
to raise that kind of cash. One more thing.
At the request of Chumhum's counsel,
I'm going to place a gag order on any and all
discussion of damages. You got it?
I'm sorry, Your Honor, wh-what's the point of that?
I'm very happy
to report that I've just come back from federal court,
where my legal team won a major victory for Chumhum
against these intrusions on all of our privacy rights by the NSA!
Yes.
Now, um...
due to, uh... this gag order,
I am not at liberty to discuss the terms of the judgment,
but suffice to say...
we are pretty happy today.
Thank you!
Hello. Alicia Florrick.
Alicia, it's Neil Gross.
Just wanted to thank you all.
You did a great job.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Gross.
Would you like me to get Cary for you?
No, no, no, it's all right.
I'm just heading to the airport.
Um, I want to make sure...
Is everything all right?
Yes.
We have permission to expand the scope.
The Danny Marwat warrant?
Yes. Though we're more concerned
about the 12 calls you discovered
to the Alicia Florrick voice mail.
We didn't catch that.
So we want to expand the warrant to a three-hop.
Three? Really?
Yes. The proximity to the governor-elect
is our concern.
We need to keep an eye on that. Anything you find,
kick it up to Mr. Froines and to myself.
Good job.
Good catch, both of you.
Thank you so much for coming by again, Chief Justice.
Certainly, Eli.
What do you need?
Peter would like you to reconsider.
He would?
Reconsider what?
Your... hesitation to the Diane Lockhart nomination.
Well, I'm not hesitant, Eli.
I am concerned.
Peter would like you to stop... being concerned.
I'm not sure how that happens unless Ms. Lockhart is...
Mr. Governor-elect.
Virgil.
You're gonna have to reconsider.
Mr. Governor-elect...
No, Virgil.
You're going to have to reconsider.
Sir, I have strong concerns.
Well, then you'll have to keep those concerns to yourself.
I know you think this is about you.
But it's not.
It's about my choice.
And I'm going to make my choice, whether you like it or not.
Diane Lockhart's office.
Mr. Gold, hello.
Actually, Diane is in a meeting at the moment.
Would you like to leave a message?
Yes. Tell her she does not
have to give the interview again.
Everything's fine.
Thank you, Diane.
Great interview.
No problem.
