Good morning everybody.
Hey.
Hi Jeff.
I brought bagels.
Oh I'd love a bagel.
Be a perfect beginning for my first day of billiards class.
Oh did you pick a special outfit
so you can look sexy shooting pool?
Shirley I have no idea what you are talkin' about.
13.
Ah great so much for "baggels."
So much for what?
The baggels. You dropped them on the floor.
Uh they're called bagels.
Uh I lived in New York Troy.
I know what a baggel is.
What the hell is wrong with you?
What?
You say bagel wrong.
I say it the same as you.
Say it again.
Baggel.
Look can we just keep studying?
We're on page 258.
What "padge" was that?
Two "five-ty" eight.
Check this out.
Oh it's a drawing of Abed with...
hearts all around it.
Strictly speaking Troy
the Bible condemns this level of friendship.
I didn't draw that.
I bought that book used.
It must have been whoever had it last.
Obviously it's a girl who has a crush on Abed.
This is so romantic.
It's just like the "Notebook" except
instead of alzheimer's Abed has--
someone who likes him.
Well whoever she is she's fat.
These thick pencil lines are drawn with a heavy hand.
We gotta find this person for Abed.
Unless it's a boy then we have to find him for Jesus.
But either way this is going to be fun.
Adios.
Adios.
Adios.
Adios.
Guys!
Class is over.
I'm trying to get you to leave.
Oh.
Oh...cool.
Pick that up.
Senor Chang?
We're trying to figure out
whose Spanish book this was before Troy's.
Jenny Adams.
Oh.
Oh come on.
If all Chinese were psychic you would have started
using birth control centuries ago.
Her name's in the front of the book morons.
Yay! He's right.
Them I understand but how did you not think of that?
I may have been thrown off
by Britta's pronunciation of the word "bagel."
How do you pronounce bagel?
I don't.
Come on.
Baggel.
Ugh! You're the worst.
So...
We have a name.
Jenny Adams.
Cool.
See? It's a fat girl's name.
Might as well be "Gravy Jones."
Pierce it doesn't matter what she looks like.
This will be great for Abed.
It will?
Aren't you excited about talking to her?
I wasn't planning on it.
What?
Guys come on. You heard Abed.
He's not interested. Drop it.
Jeff you need to mind your own business.
And Abed you need to get with this girl immediately
if not sooner.
Yeah?
Abed for guys like you
this kind of opportunity only comes around
Once in a li-- while.
It's important to date in college Abed.
It's a time of freedom and exploration
a time when a simple pillow fight between two innocent girls
could turn into a steamy night of unbridled lust.
Britta knows all about it.
Okay cool.
So you guys are gonna "Can't buy me love" me right?
We're gonna what you?
You're gonna "Can't buy me love" me.
You know transform me from zero to hero geek to chic.
Oh he wants us to "Love don't cost a thing" him.
Oh.
"Can't buy me love" was the remake for white audiences.
That's so uncomfortable when they do that.
I can't believe it doesn't insult them.
All right nobody here
is "Can't buy me love"-ing
or "Love don't cost a thing"-ing anyone.
Because we've all seen enough "Afterschool specials..."
"Fat Albert..."
to know that Abed only needs to be himself.
Sure glad there are no old people here.
This conversation would probably be total gibberish to them.
Jeff's unprecedentedly right about this.
Abed when we find this girl
you're gonna approach her just the way you are
because that's good enough.
Yeah and then you can take her to a nice deli
and treat her to a baggel.
Hey nice shooting. Good clean strokes.
Thanks.
Form a line please!
My name is Coach Bogner.
Welcome to the art of pool
which is a phys. ed. class.
Which means...
that you all have to wear the proper equipment at all times!
So suit up.
See you back on the felt in five.
You're gonna look like an ass in those.
Shut up Leonard.
I talked to your son on family day.
I know all about your gambling.
Touche.
All right everybody just hang out and be casual.
My sources tell me that Jenny Adams
is the blonde who's reading right over there.
Whoa! That's her?
She's pretty!
Wh-which is not a surprise at all Abed.
Okay Abed we're gonna be here for moral support.
Just go over there and do your thing.
Okay.
Remember be yourself.
Got it.
Great.
Cool.
Abed...
Yeah?
What are you doing?
I'm being myself.
Go be yourself by Jenny.
But I wouldn't go over there.
How do you know that?
A lifetime of observation mostly.
Well do you think there's a version of yourself
that might go over there?
Absolutely.
Could you be him?
Okay.
What the hell was that?
A different version of me.
I think it was a vampire.
All right if this is gonna turn ugly
I can't be here-- I'm a two-striker.
No Pierce please.
Hang on.
Abed will you excuse us please?
Yeah.
Look I know that we're all good people
and good people believe that people should be themselves.
But if Abed is himself he's gonna die alone.
And if we let him be someone else without our help--
Be right back.
I'm out of here.
You're not in uniform.
Yeah about that.
We seriously have to wear shorts to play pool?
If you play in this class it's regulation.
Regulation pool or regulation you?
Do you have something against playing pool
with a full range of motion and optimal comfort?
I'm comfortable in my own clothes.
I bet you are.
I'm sorry?
I said I bet you're comfortable
dressed like a model instead of an athlete
sippin' martinis and smokin' instead of keeping your game on the table!
Hey listen man.
You're implying I'm some sort of pool poser
because I don't want to wear a bathing suit.
You're the weird one.
That's weird.
Not me.
Nobody plays pool like that.
Yeah well what do you call this?
I call that your personal business okay?
And I call this class
the desecration of America's coolest sport.
Yeah ah see? Right there. Ah! "Coolest sport"!
Okay I want everybody to know what's going on here.
This hipster is dropping this class.
Because he cares more about what he looks like
than how he's playing.
Oh please.
You're the one with the rules about clothes.
And by the way I could kick your ass all over that table.
Oh is that a challenge?
Huh? Because if you play me in pool
You play me in shorts!
And if you can't do that
Well my point's already made.
I-I-I don't have anything to prove to you.
You're stupid.
This is stupid!
Pool in shorts is stupid!
Vanity thy name is...
His name.
It's the first day. I didn't catch it.
Okay Abed.
We know that normally you wouldn't approach a girl.
But if you don't learn how you won't get Jenny.
Yeah and you got two days.
Then I'm going after her.
Oh! Pierce.
What? I'm incentivizing him.
Also if she's into Abed let's face it
anybody could hit that.
I understand--I need to change who I am to someone more likable.
No no no no sweetie it's not about changing.
It's about learning.
Learning to change?
No no it's...
Good grief!
Clear the chickens off the runway.
I'll be the bad guy.
Yes Abed you need to be someone else.
Someone who eventually gets a girlfriend.
Because I can't think of anything more frightening
than a half-Polish half-Arab virgin in his 30s.
One way or the other
that story ends with an explosion.
Let's try a practice run.
All right Annie you sit here okay?
And be a girl.
Abed you take a run at her.
Let's see what you got.
Okay.
What are you reading?
"Pride and Prejudice."
So you're familiar with two sins.
How about a third?
I don't think we're allowed to smoke in here.
Then you picked the wrong outfit.
Didn't you?
Abed what are you doing?
Don Draper from "Mad Men." What'd you think?
Weird.
Awesome.
Put your tongue in her ear.
I liked it.
Don't be him.
He cheats on his wife.
Be somebody nice like Mike Brady.
He always had that housekeeper throwing herself at him
and he never made a move on her.
Don't be Mike Brady. Mike Brady's not sexy.
You should be like Jo from "Facts of Life."
But you know the dude version.
I knew it.
You should be like Calvin.
His best friend was a tiger.
He always went on dope adventures.
If anything stood in his way he just peed on it.
Calvin Coolidge?
No you guys Don Draper was clearly the sexiest.
What are you guys doing?
They're teaching me how to be someone else.
Oh for god's sake. What did I tell you guys?
Oh for god's sakes everybody do whatever you want!
Leave each other alone!
Whoa! That's a good Jeff. How'd you do that?
10% Dick Van Dyke 20% Sam Malone
40% Zach Braff from "Scrubs"
and 30% Hilary Swank in "Boys Don't Cry."
Zach Braff?
Sorry.
Abed what if you just did Jeff for Jenny?
Uh and your point is?
Look I don't want any part of this.
And I can't believe that you're still doing it
after I already explained the obvious lessons
smacking you in the face.
Hey why aren't you in billiards class?
Because I don't look cool in shorts!
Whoa. okay.
'Cause I'm not cool in shorts!
Just like him.
That was really good.
I don't want to spoil the ending but uh...
Pride ends up with prejudice.
That's funny.
I know. Stick with me and you'll get a laugh or two.
That's the Abed guarantee.
I feel like I've seen you before.
It's working.
I know.
I get that a lot from art students.
I'm told I have a face made for sketching.
I'd rather think it was made for kissing.
How 'bout for punching?
What are you doing hitting on my girlfriend ugly?
This is awkward.
Oh my god.
It's a white Abed.
I-I-I--it's like Abed but employable.
Let's do this huh boss?
Let's go slumdog.
And one last lost and found announcement
Jeff Winger I've been informed by Coach Bogner
that you left your panties in his pool class.
So better pick those up.
When is he gonna stop doing that?
Do you know that he called me a hipster?
Hipster! I mean do hipsters walk around
wearing $300 jeans from Italy?
Can we please talk about Abed?
Thanks to us his heart's been broken.
Well I hate to say that I told you so.
So I'll shout it through cupped hands
I told you so!
We were only trying to help.
Oh come on. Who are we kidding?
Jeff's right-- Abed was happy being Abed
till we had to sully his mind with thoughts of love
and romance...and vaginas.
Those are the big three. That's what they call them.
Poor Abed he's probably too sad to get out of bed this morning.
Hi.
Abed.
About yesterday...
Oh yeah.
You guys must be pretty upset.
Why would we be upset?
Well I know how important it was for you that I get a girlfriend.
So when Jenny went off with white Abed
it must have really hurt.
Ah it did.
White Abed?
Jenny's boyfriend is a white guy that's almost identical to Abed.
Name is Joey and that's why the sketch was in Troy's book.
So does that make Abed "Brown Joey"?
If you want to get racist about it.
Abed you know we just want you to be happy right?
Yeah I know. Everybody wants me to be happy.
Everybody wants to help me.
But usually when they find out they can't
they get frustrated and stop talking to me.
Or they trick me into buying them ice cream
and then shove me into a clothes dryer.
Which I didn't want to happen with you guys
so I wanted to make sure that you felt like you can help me.
The truth is lots of girls like me
because let's face it I'm pretty adorable.
And my aloofness unconsciously reminds them of their fathers so...
I'm more used to them approaching me.
So we didn't damage your self-esteem or anything?
Britta I got self-esteem falling out of my butt.
That's why I was willing to change for you guys.
Because when you really know who you are and what you like about yourself
changing for other people isn't such a big deal.
Abed...
You're a god.
If you'll all excuse me...
I have a man to beat in pool while wearing shorts.
Nice.
Is that code for going number one or number two?
Abed you've inspired me too.
People can mock me all they want.
I don't care how I say the word "baggel."
"baggel."
She said "baggel."
Would you like another one?
"baggel."
Hey nice cross corner Leonard.
Totally.
I'd like to see Jeff Winger try that shot
without the benefit of his stylish clothing.
Oh would you?
Jeff Winger.
Shouldn't you be at a "Urban Outfitters"?
I'll go there later if I feel like it.
But first I have to hand someone
their tightly polyester-swaddled ass
in a game of pool.
Burn.
Now do you want to talk about clothes like a girl?
Or use tapered sticks to hit balls
around a cushioned table... like a man?
Balls like a man.
Rack 'em!
I'll break.
Why? 'Cause it looks cool?
I don't know.
You tell me.
Get out of the way.
Yeah let me just clean this side of the table off here all right?
Okay there you go. See that? There you go.
Oh yeah. yeah. What do you think of that?
See you haven't learned anything!
Except how to look cool playing pool in shorts!
You're wrong man.
I'm just having a good time because I love playin' pool.
Liar!
You think you look cool.
Yeah?
Well how cool is this?
Stop projecting your obsession with clothes onto me
as an excuse for when I beat you in a game of real pool!
Oh you wanna play real pool huh?
I'll play real pool.
Now who doesn't care how they look?
Me!
Shouldn't you be stopping this?
Soon soon.
Just...gathering evidence.
Three to one against Winger. Who's on?
Yes!
Oh god!
You know what Jeff?
One of us is about to win this game.
But years from now when the story's retold
all they're gonna remember
is one of us loved clothes.
And the other loved... the game.
Look at me. Look at me!
You beat me.
From now on you play pool dressed however you choose.
I choose shorts.
I choose shorts!
Shorts!
You son of a bitch.
You magnificent son of a bitch!
That was awesome.
Let me get in here.
Oh! Okay you're sweaty. All right all right.
Nice game.
Thanks.
Look I-I hope this doesn't sound too... forward but um...
Could you introduce me to your friend?
You know what? I-I know that guy's m.o.
And I think it's better if you introduce yourself.
Okay.
Hi.
Hi.
Courtney.
Abed.
Man...why couldn't I be brown Joey?
Hey Abed.
Hey Troy.
Here's the Spanish book I borrowed.
Thank you. Did you finally get your own book?
Something like that.
Wait a second.
It's okay. Let's have cookies.
okay.
My cousin's funeral is today.
Oh is that-- that was today?
I knew there was some reason I couldn't do this today!
