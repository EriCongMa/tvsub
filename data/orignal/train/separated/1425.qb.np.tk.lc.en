it &apos;s easy for you to ignore
because you have the old @-@ man hearing .
but manny and i -- we have the young ears .
i don &apos;t get how one dog keeps you awake
when you grew up sleeping through
cockfights and revolutions .
mm @-@ hmm . very funny , jay .
manny hasn &apos;t been able to sleep in weeks .
it &apos;s screwing his brain for school .
and it doesn &apos;t stop .
it goes on and on and on and on and on and on
and on and on and on .
yes , that could be annoying .
that &apos;s it . i &apos;m going over there .
gloria , now , don &apos;t go starting something

that &apos;s all she &apos;s gonna want to do anyway .

in demand .
you &apos;re like jimmy buffett tickets
to these hybrid @-@ driving , straight white folks .
i hear that , girl .
yeah .
i &apos;m coming !
where the hell is the dog ?
who is it ?
it &apos;s our neighbor .
the dog is gone .
maybe it ran away .
it was chained to a tree .
maybe your wife took it .
according to my credit card , my wife is in europe ,
searching for the world &apos;s most expensive hotel .
then what do you want from us ?
you come over complaining about the dog
and the next day it &apos;s gone ?
you tell me .
i &apos;ll tell -- -how dare you ?
you come to our house , you ring our bell many times ,
and you accuse us of taking your dog .
you should go home .
we &apos;re not done here .
yes , we are .
what did you do ?
you don &apos;t want to know .
gloria &apos;s grandfather and uncles were butchers ,
so she &apos;s always had a certain comfort level
when it comes to ... killing .
one time , we had this rat ...
what ? first you smash it ,
then you cut the head off .
it was like nothing to her .
i go to church now .
she left the head out there
to send a message to the other rats .
hey .
hi , honey .
how was your day at work ?
amazing . mwah .
great . what happened ?
instead of wasting my lunch hour surfing the web ,
checking football stats ,
i put on some mellow music ,
and i meditated .
wow . for how long ?
i have no idea . i just woke up 20 minutes ago .
hey , mom .
i need a bar of soap and a black marker for an art project .
okay . well , the marker &apos;s over there ,
and the soap is under the sink .
isn &apos;t it great how much time you have
now that you &apos;re not wasting it online ?
oh , my god . is this what you always sound like ?
look what i built , dad . dunphy towers .
200 condos , a happy family in every one .
way to go , buddy .
i got to hand it to you , honey .
24 hours without video games ,
he &apos;s already contributing to society .
die ! die !
to be fair , he &apos;s using his imagination .
there &apos;s no fire escapes !
they cut corners !
i &apos;ll cut your corners !
hello ?
oh , hi . luke , honey , it &apos;s for you .
hi , griffin . how are you ?
yeah , he &apos;s right here . hold on .
hey , griffin .
oh , my god !
what happened ?
there &apos;s a parasailing @-@ donkey video on youtube .
oh , my god !
wait , luke . what about the contest ?
i quit .
i &apos;m not made of stone , you know .
uhh ! i can &apos;t believe it .
i got a &quot; b &quot; on my paper .
good for you .
yeah .
no , it would be good for you .
it &apos;s terrible for me .
thanks to your moldy encyclopedias ,
my take on mitosis was completely out of date .
they don &apos;t even call it protoplasm anymore .
it &apos;s cytoplasm .
well , you could have asked one of us .
now you &apos;re making jokes ?
i &apos;m not making a joke .
really ?
what &apos;s the difference between a gamete and a zygote ?
don &apos;t fall for it , claire .
she &apos;s just making up words .
that &apos;s it .
i need the internet .
i &apos;m out of your stupid contest .
and then there were three .
she &apos;s kind of scary .
we &apos;re not buying her a car .
hey , buddy , what you reading ?
&quot; the old man and the sea . &quot;
you like it ?
i like that hemingway gets to the point .
you read a lot of his stuff ?
that was a hint , jay .
oh , okay .
i want to ask you something ...
between you and me .
you want to know if i think my mom
did something to that dog .
yeah .
sit .
don &apos;t most kids drink soda ?
who knows what they do ?
so , your mom .
jay , i &apos;ve learned a few things in my 12 years .
don &apos;t skimp on linens ,
don &apos;t compliment a teacher on her figure ,
and when it comes to my mom ,
never ask questions i don &apos;t want the answers to .
i don &apos;t buy it . sensitive kid like you .
i think you want to know every bit as much as i do .
you &apos;re wrong .
then why is your hand shaking ?
this is my fifth one of these today .
i may have a problem .
okay . that &apos;s enough .
no , no , no , 4 : 00 tomorrow is fine .
yeah , my life partner and i will see you then .
thank -- thank you .
since when do you call me your life partner ?
since a spot opened up at billingsley academy .
but i liked wagon wheel . it had all the duckies .
and it reminded me of where i went in missouri .
cam , everyone goes to billingsley for a reason --
it &apos;s the harvard of preschools .
she &apos;s not even 2 years old yet .
she doesn &apos;t need the harvard of preschools .
she needs finger painting and duckies .
i &apos;m begging you to please just say &quot; ducks . &quot;
hello ?
great news . wagon wheel loved you .
you &apos;re in .
oh .
wagon wheel wants us .
oh , yes !
okay . well , that &apos;s great and everything ,
but actually we have an appointment tomorrow
at billingsley .
really ?
yeah , apparently we are in very high demand .
oh , well , just so you know , i don &apos;t think wagon wheel
is gonna hold a place for you .
well , i think we &apos;re gonna take our chance .
take our chance ? that sounds chancy .
you know , mitchell ,
you were the one who called me in a panic .
you were the one who needed me to get you in .
i &apos;m sorry , claire .
i didn &apos;t mean to put you out .
but let &apos;s not get too dramatic here .
you wrote an e @-@ mail .
it wasn &apos;t an e @-@ mail .
it was a phone call from a land line .
what did you do ?
what &apos;s best for lily .
did you ?
cam , this is the first time that being gay
is a competitive advantage .
they &apos;re choosing teams for gym class ,
and we &apos;re finally getting picked first .
i always got picked first .
i could throw a dodgeball through a piece of plywood .
but i see your point .
don &apos;t sneak up on me like that .
what are you doing out here ?
you got in my head about my mom .
is that the rat shovel ?
yeah .
are you checking it for signs of dog ?
i was going to .
well , let &apos;s do this quick .
if she catches us ,
we &apos;re as dead as that dog probably is .
what are you doing here ?
nothing .
why are you looking at that shovel ?
do you think someone
did something with that shovel , manny ?
he thinks you killed the dog .
you little rat .
don &apos;t call me a rat !
she kills rats !
you really think that i would kill a dog ?
well , what was i supposed to think ?
i don &apos;t know .
how about i didn &apos;t kill a dog ?
just tell me what you did with it .
he &apos;s in a better place .
that &apos;s what people say when something &apos;s dead .
okay , fine .
i took him to a farm
where he has plenty of room to run .
that &apos;s the second thing people say when something &apos;s dead .
my hairdresser &apos;s brother has three kids .
they live in the country .
they were so happy to have the dog
that they gave me a jar of pickles .
is that also what they say when something is dead ?
really ?
look . look how happy they are ,
instead of him being tied to a tree outside
with no one to talk to .
why didn &apos;t you just tell me this in the first place ?
like you would be okay with me stealing a dog ?
no .
exactly .
that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t tell you .
now the dog is happy , manny can sleep ,
and we have pickles .
okay , it worked out this time ,
but don &apos;t forget that stealing is against the law .
now , maybe in colombia .
ah , here we go ,
because in colombia we trip over goats
and we kill people in the street .
do you know how offensive that is ?
like we are peruvians !
the contest was hard .
reservations .
even though we had sworn off the internet ,
the rest of the world hadn &apos;t .
orlando .
domestic .
representative .
representative !
representative ! representative !
you &apos;ve got mail .
really , claire ?
you don &apos;t understand .
i was trying to deal with our plane tickets
to visit your family .
please stop . you &apos;re just embarrassing yourself .
well , it looks like it &apos;s just you and me , old man .
bring it .
and finally , here we are back at the office .
if you two would like to take a seat ,
i will let mr. plympton know that you &apos;re here .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
this place is amazing !
i told you .
it &apos;s like hogwarts !
the ladybug sanctuary .
oh , my gosh . the little cobblestones .

do you think they &apos;re gonna let us in ?
cam , relax .

i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s going on .
i win .
nobody gets a car , i dump tom brady ,
and our long amish nightmare is over .
i can &apos;t believe you thought
you were gonna put one over on us .
i can &apos;t believe
that he &apos;s actually already on the internet .
believe it , girl .
so , you &apos;re actually online right now ?
yep .
well , then i hate to break it to you , daddy ,
but you lose .
what ?

and colored it in with a marker .
phil , she carved a telephone out of a bar of soap .
i can &apos;t believe it ! i &apos;m getting a car !
holy crap . we &apos;ve been shawshanked .
sorry about the delay .
i was going over the plans for our new dance studio .

um , well , i --
while my white @-@ man name is tucker ,
i am 1 / 16 cherokee .
ready for child to soar like eagle .
oh , god .
so , what are you saying ?
you &apos;re not getting a car .
but i won .
yes , but we never thought you would .
so ?
so , congratulations on your victory .
nobody can ever take that away from you .
so true . mm @-@ hmm .
but i spent two days in my room
talking to a bar of soap .
it &apos;s not fair .
it &apos;s totally not fair .
we &apos;re outraged .
bad parenting .
but we had a deal .
which , in hindsight , was utter nonsense .
hey .
we hated billingsley .
the place is so stupid . ugh !
you blew the interview , didn &apos;t you ?
lesbians .
in a wheelchair .
oh .
you still mad at me ?
you tell me .
what is this ?
i &apos;ve been thinking if you said as much about america
as i said about colombia , i &apos;d be plenty ticked off .
doesn &apos;t make up for everything , but ...
a trip to colombia ?
i want to see your village , learn your culture .
i love you .
i &apos;m sure i &apos;m gonna love where you come from .
aw , jay . thank you , thank you , thank you .
no way he &apos;s going to my village .
i was in two car accidents when i was living there .
both times i hit a goat .
one was hurt pretty bad .
but it was a good thing i had a shovel in the trunk .
the tribe builter fortold that
though i lay with fire @-@ haired man ,
the giving hawk would bring us baby
with her skin the color of sweet corn ,
which my people call maize .
please stop .
well , um ...
knowledge is her sustenance ,
like so much maize --
which , you &apos;ll remember , means &quot; corn . &quot;
