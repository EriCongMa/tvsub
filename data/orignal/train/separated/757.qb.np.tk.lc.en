第一季 第十一集
your sheets are so soft .
they &apos;re actually been in family for almost 40 years .
if these old things could talk , huh ?
ew .
i was just trying to paint a picture .
read the room .
sheez .
hey , julia .
hey .
it &apos;s so fun having another girl around here .
there are tampons hidden all over the apartment .
ah ! damp towel ! damp !
here we go ...
it &apos;s like a really big wet @-@ nap .
ah . i feel like i &apos;m being licked by a golden retriever .
look at this bathroom .
there should not be two girls in this bathroom .
you &apos;re too humid . you make everything damp .
80 % of the products in here are yours .
blah , blah , blah , yawn , yes .
i use sculpting chutney .
once i &apos;m done with my chutney , back in the row it goes .
hair everywhere ...
the multicolored rubber bands .
i &apos;m fine with it . it &apos;s all okay with me .
but a damp towel is where i draw the line .
sorry , so what are your thoughts on damp towel
oh , you &apos;d better watch it , nick &apos;s overnight guest .
julia .
i know your name .
are you flexing , right now ?
no .
hey . so , i &apos;m gonna just get ready in your room .
sure . feeling a little weird and uncomfortable in here ?
hey , julia , i &apos;ll see you later tonight .
yeah . see you later .
she &apos;s helping me get out of a traffic ticket .
jess , are you seriously using the girl i &apos;m sleeping with
for free legal advice ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry , the girl you &apos;re sleeping with ?
i mean , you can &apos;t call her your girlfriend ?
we &apos;re not labeling it .
oh , you &apos;re not labeling it ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re too sophisticated .
don &apos;t do your &quot; sophisticated guy . &quot;
that &apos;s now how a sophisticated man dances .
how does a sophisticated man dance ?
i &apos;m too sophisticated
i don &apos;t believe in labeling .
you gotta get laid , man .
you gotta get laid , man .
yeah , i need to get laid .
this is bad .
get out of here .
you know , maybe i should call shelby .
i haven &apos;t seen her since i got back from latvia .
we did have an amazing time together .
whoo ! that was amazing .
yeah .
all right , bye .
i &apos;m gonna call her .
yeah , over in latvia
they had this fermented milk stuff that they drink .
whole country runs on the stuff . called ( bleats )
( bleats ) was definitely one of my biggest endorsements .
i mean , i have a lot of endorsements ,
but that was probably my biggest endorsement
amongst other endorsements that i had .
wow .
so , um ... your place or mine ?
what are we laughing at ?
how much i &apos;m not going home with you tonight .
you show up after two years , out of the blue ,
and all you do is talk about yourself .
you don &apos;t even let me get a word in edgewise .
why did you agree to let me take you out for drinks ?
winston , you took me out for a drink
at the place where i work !
here &apos;s your bill .
thanks for the water .
man , i told you to get yourself whatever you wanted .
you chose water .
have a seat .
okay .
let me get you a blanket .
why would i want a blanket right now ?
just to get toasty .
would you like a cookie , or a cupcake ? i made them .
oh , no . i &apos;m okay . i &apos;m not really a dessert person .
i just don &apos;t eat it , usually .
okay . okay .
i &apos;m just gonna put this ,
like , right here .
i don &apos;t ... okay . just ...
why don &apos;t you just take me through
what happened with the ticket ?
okay .
they got a photo of you ?
at the scene of the crime
is this it ?
yeah .
okay .
hmm . this may actually be kind of hard to argue with .
well , there &apos;s actually more there than meets the eye .
um , there was a bird-- he &apos;s not in the shot--
but he was injured ,
and he couldn &apos;t get out of the road , and so i braked ,
and then i had to accelerate out of the intersection .
you missed your first court date on this .
my ex @-@ boyfriend failed to send it to me
before the court date ,
because he doesn &apos;t believe in mail ,
which has to do with his thoughts on government spending .
now it &apos;s an $ 800 fine .
that &apos;s why i need , like , a really awesome lawyer , like you .
so ... can you help me ?
i mean , i can try . you never know .
a judge might buy into this whole thing , so ...
what &quot; whole thing &quot; ?
your whole thing .
with the cupcakes , and the braking for birds ,
and ... bluebirds come and help me dress in the morning .
oh , i didn &apos;t know i was doing a thing .
it &apos;s a great thing . i mean , the big ,
beautiful eyes , like a scared baby .
i &apos;m sure that gets you out of all kinds of stuff .
yeah . yeah , except my peripheral vision &apos;s , like , almost too good .
hey , so ...
living here , it &apos;s probably fun , right ?
yeah .
there are , like , lots of girls
coming in and out of this place ?
schmidt &apos;s like ellis island in the 1800s .
he accepts everyone .
yeah , and ... winston and nick ...
i probably shouldn &apos;t ...
oh , yeah . well , you don &apos;t have to ...
plead the fifth !
no , that &apos;s not what ...
objection !
nick , hey !
hey , julia !
you want to hang out in your room ?
sure .
jess , if you &apos;ll excuse us ,
julia &apos;s about to be very disappointed .
okay , so i will look at this stuff some more ,
i @-@ i &apos;ll call some people , see what i can do .
here &apos;s your blankie back .
power blazer .
what &apos;s going on with the ticket ?
she has a problem with me , nick .
okay ? she doesn &apos;t like me .
what are you talking about ?
you don &apos;t understand , &apos; cause you &apos;re a guy .
she does not have a problem with you . she &apos;s just ...
nick , your girlfriend &apos;s not a dessert person .
she said you have &quot; a whole thing &quot; ?
i &apos;m sorry , she doesn &apos;t like desserts ?
where is she right now ?
look , i think i know what she meant .
i mean , you do like girly stuff .
i mean , it kind of freaked me out at first .
when i met you , you were wearing a hat made of ribbons .
my ribbon hat . i love that hat .
screw her . and i &apos;m gonna wear that ribbon hat .
go get it , right now .
be right back .
there she is .
nick , where is this bitch ?
gonna smack that lawyer learning right out of her mouth .
okay , this is getting excessive , guys .
she &apos;s actually helping her get out of a ticket .
by being condescending and judgmental ?
what did she say ?
just drop it , nick .
okay , what did julia do wrong ?
it &apos;s just how girls fight sometimes .
there &apos;s a lot unsaid .
like one time , a girl said to me ,
&quot; jess , you rock a lot of polka dots . &quot;
how did she say it ?
&quot; jess , you rock a lot of polka dots . &quot;
that is diabolical .
i &apos;m really sorry .
and it ruined our friendship .
i mean , i couldn &apos;t get over the polka dot incident .
warning ! spoiler alert .
somebody unplugged my dehumidifier
to plug in their flatiron .
i will be putting my dehumidifier , and my towel ,
in my room , where nothing ever gets wet .
all right , you know what , jess ?
julia &apos;s one of those girls where she doesn &apos;t have ,
like , a lot of girl friends .
because she thinks like a guy .
she doesn &apos;t play mind games .
so blind !
look , all i know is she &apos;s totally up front with me .
no subtext , no codes .
oh . okay . so did she come right out and ask you
if you were seeing other girls ?
because ... she asked me .
she did ?
you didn &apos;t know that ?
&apos;cause i thought you guys were so up front with one another .
i thought you guys told each other everything .
yeah .
she told him she didn &apos;t want to label it .
i mean , that &apos;s a classic move ,
even in the lesbian community .
what are we talking about ?
did you just hear the phrase &quot; lesbian community &quot;
and come running out of your room ?
i did . uh ...
question , for you .
this community you speak of ,
do the ladies look , uh ...
more like this one or , you know ...
kind of nickish ?
shut up , schmidt .
i did date a woman who looked a lot like nick .
you did . felicia .
why can &apos;t you just admit that she &apos;s your girlfriend ?
i know , i just thought it was uncomplicated ,
and now i &apos;m freaking out .
i &apos;m not good at being a boyfriend .
i &apos;m good at being that guy
that you find yourself spending more and more time with
until you meet your husband .
all right . so , so far , nick miller &apos;s list of fears is
sharks , tap water , real relationships .
and blueberries .
barkeep . get this man a drink .
ladies , he hasn &apos;t had sex in four months .
come and get it , ladies .
i seriously hate you , schmidt .
why ?
it didn &apos;t go well with shelby ?
i gotta say , i thought it would be easy .
you know ? maybe ...
maybe i don &apos;t have game . maybe i never had game .
maybe it &apos;s always been about basketball .
yeah , you don &apos;t have any game .
it &apos;s always been because you play basketball .
are you seriously just realizing that you don &apos;t have game ?
what is your secret , man ? how do normal guys get girls ?
let &apos;s not say &quot; normal . &quot; just ,
you know , say what it is-- &quot; average . &quot;
you &apos;ve had the most game , out of any of us .
because for years now ,
you &apos;ve been working with absolutely nothing .
he makes a good point .
okay . i &apos;ve been working with nothing .
zilch .
you &apos;re right , i &apos;ve got nothing .
except this .
oh , my god .
miller ! no cocktail !
sorry , julio .
julia ! hey , julia !
hey .
oh , you guys are using names ?
that &apos;s not too labelly for you ?
jules .
thought i &apos;d drop by and say hello .
oh , i didn &apos;t know we were doing drop @-@ bys .
here &apos;s a scenario that paid sexual dividends ,
particularly in the asian markets ,
and i think , jess , you can back me up on this .
inform her that you &apos;re an aerialist
for the cirque du soleleil .
winston , just ask questions ,
pay attention to her , listen to her ,
don &apos;t listen to him .
oh , believe me , i don &apos;t take advice from schmidt .
never have , never will . ever .
so jess told me what you asked her yesterday .
what ?
that you asked if i was sleeping with other people .
that is not even ... i ... what ?
i don &apos;t want to play games .
that &apos;s not what happened , okay ?
i just said something to her ,
because i was feeling kind of guilty ,
because i &apos;m , uh ....
i &apos;m dating other people , and i just , you know ...
wanted to see if you were also dating other people .
you &apos;re dating other people ?
yeah , yeah .
no . no , i &apos;m seeing other people , too .
good . good .
i &apos;m having sex all the time . i &apos;m like a mailman .
except instead of mail , it &apos;s hot sex that i deliver .
i &apos;ve had to start carrying , like ,
athletic shoes in my purse ,
&apos;cause i have to sprint from one sexual encounter to another .
can &apos;t wear heels .
well , i &apos;m having sex right now .
under the bar .
and she &apos;s on top .
so figure that out .
was that her ?
yeah .
well , great .
then we &apos;re both doing the exact same thing .
and we &apos;re on the same page .
kudos for not putting labels on things .
that is exactly what i want .
it &apos;s my dream .
just going to go to the bathroom really quickly .
okay .
great .
hey . julia ?
are you serious ?
did nick say some stuff to you ?
because i &apos;m really sorry , and i want to explain ...
why would you tell him that i said that ?
do you know what that makes me look like ?
i see what you &apos;re doing .
i know that i &apos;m the mean lawyer girl
who wears suits and works too much
and you ... you &apos;re the really fun teacher girl
with all the colorful skirts and you bake things .
and eventually , nick is going to come running to you
and you &apos;ll tuck him in under his blankie and ...
what is it with you and the blankie thing ?
i never said the word blankie .
i don &apos;t talk like teddy ruxpin .
if i acted the way that you act when i was at work ,
nobody would listen to me .
well , if i acted like you at work ,
my students would turn in
really weird , dark dioramas , so ...
i don &apos;t like you .
and i don &apos;t want to be your friend , so ...
fine .
can you leave , please ?
because ...
i am about to start crying ,
and you are the last person
that i want to cry in front of .
i want to cry , too , and ...
where am i supposed to cry ?
you can &apos;t monopolize the bathroom crying space .
please go .
what are you doing , jess ?
get out !
i &apos;m sorry .
winston , what are you doing ?
i am coming here to listen to you .
should i interrupt to tell you that ...
probably not . so ,
how were you tell me about your life and how &apos;s everything ?
winston , what am i supposed to do ?
i was a booty call for two years ,
and then i was nothing for two years .
you show up bragging after all this time
like nothing has changed .
what do you want me to think ?
that i &apos;m an idiot .
and you know what ?
you &apos;re right , and i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just that since i &apos;ve stopped playing ball ,
i realize i &apos;m not that good at this .
and , quite frankly , you are way out of my league .
that is clear now .
but ... i do hope this is not the last time i see you ,
but whatever you want , i &apos;m cool with .
i got to get back to work .
yeah .
yeah , i &apos;ll help you .
see ?
i &apos;m the manager .
oh , you &apos;re the manager ?
yeah .
wow , that &apos;s amazing .
it &apos;s okay .
case 73 .
mr. sandoval .
i see you have dressed for the occasion .
you didn &apos;t have to come .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re very busy .
i said that i would be here ,
so i &apos;m here .
don &apos;t worry . i think i can handle it .
let &apos;s just get this over with so we can get out of here .
your honor .
your honor .
your honor .
these are the facts , your honor .
your honor .
case 74-- jessica day .
yes , sir . yes , i &apos;m present , sir .
okay , listen . you just have to enter the plea yourself ,
all right , and then i &apos;ll do the rest .
okay , okay . i got it , all right ?
so you know , all you have to do is say ...
i got it ! thank you .
okay . okay .
how do you plead ?
guilty .
what ?
great . pay your fine upstairs .
well , i guess we &apos;re never going to know
if the bird defense works .
such a bummer , too .
with this poor at my office .
okay . hey !
i got something to say to you , man .
what ?
i brake for birds .
i rock a lot of polka dots .
i have touched glitter in the last 24 hours .
i spend my entire day talking to children .
and i find it fundamentally strange
that you &apos;re not a dessert person .
that &apos;s just weird , and it freaks me out .
and i &apos;m sorry i don &apos;t talk like murphy brown .
and i hate your pantsuit .
i wish it had ribbons on it or something
to make it just lightly cuter .
and that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m not smart
and tough and strong .
okay .
and i know you like nick ,
and i &apos;m not trying to interfere ,
but you should just talk to him about it .
are you done ?
i am almost done .
i &apos;m about to go and pay this $ 800 fine ,
and my checks have baby farm animals on them , bitch .
that &apos;s the wrong way .
you moved .
you remember my old place ?
the place in the hood ?
it was hood @-@ adjacent .
whatever .
so , um ... so this was nice .
yeah , it was .
you want to know what i want to do now ?
what ?
take you on a real date .
why don &apos;t you call me ?
good night , winston .
winston , what &apos;s happening ?
yeah , good night .
what is wrong with you , man ?
you got no game . that was so stupid .
hey ! anyone !
my towel !
can someone please get my towel ?
it &apos;s in my room next to my irish walking cape .
the ... the bigger towel .
not ... do not touch the small one .
okay , i left my towel in my room .
nobody look .
nobody look , yo .
we don &apos;t want to .
nobody look .
seriously , no ... no one &apos;s looking ?
all right , forget it .
aah ! damn it !
see , he &apos;s a natural blond .
what shape is that supposed to be shaved into ?
think he &apos;s trying to force perspective .
very funny . i got to get something off my chest .
no , schmidt , there is an apron
right over there-- go cover yourself .
you are jewish .
you &apos;re making me gayer .
are you going to go on , like , a big wet towel rant ?
no . this is now a sex rant .
to wit ,
six months ago , i thought
getting a girl roommate would mean sex all the time--
definitely with her friends and probably with her .
are there women here ?
yeah , sure , more than ever .
but you-- not going to happen .
you , i will never give up .
and you ... well , you sample from the gumbo pot .
i am in a damp bathroom
full of naked women every day , and i hate it .
it &apos;s like a nightmare . i &apos;m in a ...
watermelon @-@ themed apron with a ...
a tampon ?
why would you need this for cooking ?
i just had an idea .
why don &apos;t we hang our towels on towel bars instead of hooks ,
and that &apos;ll make them dryer ?
that is the ...
that is ... that is a great idea .
quick question for you .
as a lesbian gynecologist ,
perhaps , one of these days , the two of us
could sit down and talk about osi .
what is osi ?
our shared interest .
schmidt , clothe yourself !
all right , all right .
it was just a suggestion .
hey .
hi .
nick &apos;s not here .
that &apos;s okay .
uh , because i came here to ...
well , i kind of came
because i @-@ i thought it would be good if you and i ...
hey , jess , my hands are actually stuck
in the yarn because ...
i didn &apos;t realize that you had people over . sorry .
no , it &apos;s just ... crochet time .
yeah .
nick &apos;s not here right now .
no , i know .
thanks .
i &apos;ll just come back later .
hey , julia .
do you want to crochet with us ?
i mean , growing up was brutal .
i went to an all @-@ girls school .
the worst-- girls can be so mean to each other .
yeah , cece and i hid in the bathroom for four years .
this is ... this is really nice , guys .
thank you for letting me join in .
it &apos;s totally relaxing .
except that i don &apos;t know why ,
if i put the fox through the cave ,
it doesn &apos;t ... the yarn is broken .
i don &apos;t know
why this is not turning into ...
what you making ?
a hat .
if you &apos;re making a hat for a baby , it is done .
yeah .
hey , julia .
what are you doing here ?
could i talk to you for a second ?
okay .
hey , julia .
stop .
no , there &apos;s something that i need to say to you .
all right . then go ahead .
okay .
okay .
i &apos;m going to say it .
okay , i ...
just say it .
all right . i @-@ i wanted to say that ...
i don &apos;t want to date anybody else .
i just want to date you .
well , that &apos;s what i was going to say to you .
really ?
yeah .
so , then ... so , then , what does that mean ?
you &apos;re , like , my boyfriend now ?
i &apos;m not really into labels .
yeah , all right .
boyfriend .
that &apos;s so lame .
you &apos;re totally going to ...
carry my books home from school .
i will if you wear my leatherman jacket .
it &apos;s &quot; letterman &quot; jacket .
no , i &apos;m pretty sure
it &apos;s a leatherman jacket .
you letter ...
the leather sleeves that the football guys wear ?
i &apos;m right . i &apos;m right .
i &apos;m glad you pitched a fit ,
because my towel is very dry .
i didn &apos;t pitch a fit . i just ...
damp !
damn it !
everybody-- bathroom now !
what &apos;s up , dad ?
what , schmidt ?
is someone playing a joke on me ?
honestly , why is my towel still damp ?
cause it &apos;s not your towel ; it &apos;s my towel , schmidt .
no , it &apos;s not your towel . your towel is the red one .
i &apos;ll tell you this , pal .
i &apos;ve never used that .
i do use that one every single day .
oh , god .
this towel &apos;s so warm and fluffy .
it &apos;s like it &apos;s been in the sun forever .
this means you two have been drying your junk
with the same towel .
intimate .
are you out of your mind ? !
what do you mean , am i ...
how do you think this is your towel ? do you even wash it ?
no , i don &apos;t wash the towel ; the towel washes me .
who washes a towel ?
you never wash ... ?
you wash your towel ?
you never wash the towel ?
what am i going to do ?
wash the shower next ? wash a bar of soap ?
you got to think here , pal .
i &apos;m furious right now .
i get out of the damn shower , i &apos;m clean as a damn baby ,
and i use the towel .
let me ask you this .
have you been wearing my underpants ?
sometimes , yeah . who cares ?
you guys don &apos;t wear each other &apos;s underpants ?
