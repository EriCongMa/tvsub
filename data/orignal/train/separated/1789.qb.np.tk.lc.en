dad , this is sheldon &apos;s mother , mary .
how do you do ?
nice to meet you .
and , of course , mom .
hello , my hateful shrew .
hello to you , you wrinkled old bastard .
hey , i just got an e @-@ mail from the u.s. air force .
i &apos;m just afraid if i respond ,
then they &apos;ll know i got it .
oh , dude .
the minute you opened that e @-@ mail ,
they knew you got it .
i mean , they &apos;re probably looking at you
through the camera right now .
oh , god .
i think someone &apos;s following us .
uh , turn left here and see if he turns with us .
why is he turning here ? the restaurant &apos;s the other way .
i don &apos;t know . he uses that traffic app .
maybe there &apos;s an accident .
oh , so follow him .
oh , no !
leonard , if you don &apos;t mind ,
i think i &apos;m a little tired .
i &apos;m gonna call it a night .
sure , dad .
i &apos;m a little tuckered out myself .
well , i will see you all in the morning .
would you like to share a cab ?
that would be fine .
where are you staying ?
i &apos;m at the westin .
well , so am i.
could i interest you in a nightcap ?
i think that you could .
leonard ?
leonard ?
what ?
you realize you and i could become brothers .
we &apos;re not gonna be brothers .
we &apos;re not gonna be stepbrothers .
go to sleep .
i hope you &apos;re right .
&apos;cause a grown man living with his brother
and his brother &apos;s wife is weird .
go to sleep .
okay .
do you think your father &apos;s doing unspeakable things
to my mother ?
no .
are you saying that
because the things are unspeakable ?
your parents are old .
anything unspeakable was finished by 9 : 30 .
go to sleep .
very well .
i &apos;m sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward .
god , i thought my brother fresh out of jail
was gonna make everyone uncomfortable ,
but now this ...
hey , if you want me to sleep
you &apos;re gonna have to stop talking .
okay , i &apos;m gonna go pick up my family .
like an hour and half , two hours , depending on traffic .
yeah , drive safe .
oh , hey , and do yourself a favor , all right ?
when beverly gets here , do not bring up last night .
all right ? as far as you &apos;re concerned ,
you don &apos;t know anything ,
you didn &apos;t see anything .
i want you just to play dumb .
it was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example .
what ?
hi . okay , hey there , i got-- i &apos;m sorry , i got to go now .
penny , wait .
why ?
i wanted to thank you for going through all the trouble
of planning a second wedding ceremony for me ,
but unfortunately i cannot attend .
well , why ? what &apos;s wrong ?
wha-- are we still doing the dumb thing ?
okay , why , what &apos;s wrong ?
i just cannot stay here
while your father goes out of his way to humiliate me .
oh , golly , however did he humiliate you ?
stop it , sheldon .
do i say &quot; stop what ? &quot; or just throw in the towel ?
i don &apos;t see why i should have to watch your father
parade around with some bible @-@ thumping bumpkin .
oh , excuse me , that is my mother you &apos;re talking about ,
however accurately .
okay , beverly ,
aren &apos;t you overreacting a little ?
all we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap .
and turned their phones off .
not helping , buddy .
mother , penny and i really want you to be part of this .
please stay .
yeah , plus if you leave ,
alfred will know he got under your skin .
well , we can &apos;t have that .
you know , also , if they did have coitus ,
we &apos;ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist .
it is funny when you think about it .
maybe to you .
you didn &apos;t get a $ 500 traffic ticket .
because you were driving like a lunatic .
hey , if thinking secret government agents
are chasing you makes you a lunatic , then ...
yeah , okay .
oh , i &apos;ll get it .
it didn &apos;t help that you couldn &apos;t walk a straight line
when the cop pulled you over .
i have performance anxiety .
you of all people should know that .
hello .
i &apos;m looking for howard wolowitz .
howard wolowitz ?
i have the right address , don &apos;t i ?
address ?
is he here ?
um ... no .
do you know where i can find him ?
may i ask what this is about ?
no , you may not .
very well .
have him call me .
okay .
raj , who &apos;s at the door ?
that &apos;s not him .
oh , i can &apos;t wait for you to meet everyone .
i told them all about you .
like what ?
do they know about your brother ?
uh , not everything , just , like , the jail and drugs part .
why would you do that ?
what ?
the world doesn &apos;t need to know our problems .
well , mom , i &apos;m sorry , but ...
hey , look , they got walgreens here , too .
you really think it &apos;s helpful to change the subject , wyatt ?
just trying to make this a happy trip , dear .
well , quit it !
so , uh , randall , can &apos;t believe after all these years
you finally get to visit me in california .
well , good thing i was a nonviolent offender ,
otherwise i couldn &apos;t have left the state .
all right , that &apos;s enough jail talk .
penny knows where i was ; she sent me cigarettes .
you sent your brother cigarettes ?
he was cooking and selling crystal meth , susan ,
i think we can let the cigarettes slide .
stop trying to be the cool dad ;
you have a shirt with our cat &apos;s picture on it .
anyway , we &apos;re here , slugger .
that &apos;s great , now they know where i live .
what are you talking about ?
they &apos;ve always known where you live .
yeah , if you want to go off the grid ,
you have to move out of your mother &apos;s house .
can we take a moment to discuss
that i just lied to the government for you ?
yeah .
i would not have done that for you .
howard , please just call the man , see what he wants .
all right , all right .
hey , make sure you tell him that
you weren &apos;t home when he came by
and that your indian friend gave you the message
the moment you stepped through the door .
yes , hello .
uh , this is howard wolowitz
for colonel richard williams .
oh , i take it back , don &apos;t mention me .
hi , colonel williams , how can i help you ?
what ? oh , uh , yes , he is from india .
no , i don &apos;t know his immigration status .
relax , i &apos;m still on hold !
speaking .
okay , sure , i can meet with you on thursday .
caltech is fine .
yeah , and may i ask what this is about ?
i may not ?
that &apos;s what he said to me .
here you are , mother .
thank you .
i &apos;m glad you decided to stay .
it &apos;s gonna be special for penny and me to share this with you .
i can &apos;t wait for this day to be over .
yeah , special , like that .
that &apos;s them .
please don &apos;t make things any more awkward than they already are .
all right , so less or equally awkward , got it .
hey , guys , come on in .
oh , thank you .
good morning .
morning .
hello .
how is everyone today ?
good , and you ?
good , good .
good .
i &apos;m good , too .
good .
so , did you defile my mother or not ?
sheldon !
you &apos;re being rude .
if i may , i can assure you ,
your mother and i did nothing more
than share a cab and a conversation .
did that conversation include the phrase
&quot; your genitals are a joy to behold &quot; ?
that &apos;s enough !
look , i promise you , neither i ,
nor anyone , has ever said that .
you don &apos;t know his girlfriend very well .
or what a joy it is to behold my genitals .
all right , you guys , uh , get settled in ,
then we &apos;ll go across the hall and say hi to everyone .
you know , it &apos;s hard to believe i &apos;ve never met leonard .
well , he probably buys his illegal drugs
from a local vendor .
not funny , wyatt .
i thought it was really funny .
thanks .
well , fine , if everyone wants to make jokes about our problems ,
then i can , too .
knock , knock . who &apos;s there ?
our family is an embarrassment .
that &apos;s not much of a joke .
okay .
listen , mom , i know you &apos;re nervous , but i promise you ,
no one is gonna judge you or this family .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just we &apos;re meeting leonard &apos;s parents for the first time ,
and @-@ and they &apos;re academics and @-@ and intellectuals ,
and i don &apos;t want them thinking we &apos;re white trash .
well , what color trash do you think they &apos;ll believe ?
how could you think that i would spend the night
with a man i just met ?
a man named jesus
convinced you to build a church in africa .
you &apos;re kind of a sucker .
well , nothing happened , right ?
i @-@ it &apos;s over .
until we get married a third time ,
you guys will never have to see each other again .
well , you know , actually that &apos;s not the case .
mary may visit me in new york .
and he &apos;s never been to texas .
maybe we meet halfway .
what ? in the chattahoochee national forest in georgia ?
i can &apos;t be the only one that knows that &apos;s halfway .
you &apos;re not seriously going to visit each other .
and why wouldn &apos;t we ?
oh , please , you &apos;re just saying this to antagonize me .
not at all .
mary happens to be a wonderful woman .
and if it antagonizes you , tothat &apos;s just a bonus .
mary , i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re in the middle of this .
no , no , nothing to be sorry about .
i genuinely like your father .
what ? but he &apos;s a mediocre academic .
and according to beverly , his sexual prowess is subpar .
he &apos;s basically leonard with a bigger prostate .
are you saying that my dad &apos;s not good enough for your mom ?
yes , while also getting in a solid dig at you .
pretty efficient , huh ?
this is ridiculous . i @-@ i &apos;m going across the hall .
but why should you get to go
and leave me here with your bickering parents ?
fine , then you go !
well , i don &apos;t want to stay here with her . i &apos;ll go .
i &apos;ll go with you .
that still leaves me here with him .
hang on , hang on !
we &apos;re smart , we can figure this out .
okay , so ... mary and beverly can &apos;t be together .
uh , alfred and beverly can &apos;t be together .
leonard and i can &apos;t be together .
now , i could be with alfred ...
but i don &apos;t like his face .
oh , here ! i &apos;ve got it !
who &apos;s ready for a wedding ?
great , now i have to start all over .
so how &apos;s the world of pharmaceuticals treating you ?
pretty good . i actually just got assigned
a much better territory .
see what happens when you work hard ?
hey , she just sells drugs . i had to make &apos; em .
okay , that &apos;s enough .
no more drug talk for the rest of this trip .
i &apos;ll drink to that .
haven &apos;t you had enough ?
penny drinks more than i do .
well , i learned from the best .
very nice , wyatt .
and you wonder why this one turned out the way he did .
you see what i &apos;ve gotta put up with !
what you &apos;ve gotta put up with ?
why did you have to go to jail ?
it &apos;s called getting caught , mother !
hello !
hey , there he is ! hey !
oh , leonard ! it &apos;s so nice to see you again !
oh , you , too !
hey , everyone , this is my mother , beverly .
hello.- hi .
we are not white trash !
are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle ?
yes , i am .
i &apos;m just feeling a little guilty
about all the trouble i &apos;ve caused .
oh , so am i.
you made god sad today , mom .
sheldon , they haven &apos;t done anything wrong .
i think it &apos;s nice they &apos;re hitting it off .
well , that &apos;s still no reason to rush into anything .
look at us .
we took things remarkably slow .
you and i , we didn &apos;t even hold hands for two years .
it was a lot hotter than it sounds .
you &apos;re a patient young lady .
hey , hey ! she &apos;s mine !
take a cold shower , grandpa !
why wouldn &apos;t that colonel say what the meeting &apos;s about ?
it has to be bad news .
calm down , okay ? try not to think about it .
that &apos;s really stupid advice .
you know that hurts my feelings .
calm down , try not to think about it .
okay .
why do i bother talking to you ?
oh , come on . what &apos;s the worst that could come of this meeting ?
i don &apos;t know . they take the invention away ,
and i get nothing ?
okay , that &apos;s not so bad .
you know what happened to the scientists
that worked on the manhattan project ?
the government forced them to move to the desert .
they had to live in secret ,
and when oppenheimer objected
to what they made him do ,
they destroyed his reputation .
what &apos;s the point of that story ?
i just read a book about oppenheimer ,
seemed like a chance to show off .
there he is !
there &apos;s my happy hebraic homeboy .
yeah , that &apos;s the smile i &apos;m gonna remember
when you &apos;re living in the desert and i &apos;m living with your wife .
so , what do you do for a living ?
mommy , you want to take this one ?
um , randall &apos;s in between jobs .
and court appearances .
it &apos;s nice to meet the woman
who raised this fine young man .
i &apos;m looking forward to meeting his father .
prepare to be disappointed .
and he can &apos;t wait to meet you , too .
can i get anyone a drink ?
well , i could use another beer .
you &apos;re done .
he &apos;s done .
hey ! is everyone getting to know each other ?
not at all !
nice to see you again , dr. hofstadter .
i &apos;m , uh , leonard &apos;s friend , stuart .
nice to see you , too .
hi , i &apos;m stuart .
ooh , i &apos;m alfred . leonard &apos;s father .
oh ! oh , hi .
uh , i &apos;m sorry , did you two want to sit together ?
no .
no .
i was wondering why the front row was available .
okay , i think we &apos;re ready .
why do people cry at weddings ?
they &apos;re practicing for what &apos;s coming later .
thank you for cleaning yourself up for your sister &apos;s wedding .
thank you for my new teeth .
welcome to the family , leonard .
don &apos;t lend your new brother @-@ in @-@ law money .
we &apos;re here today to celebrate love .
sigh louder , no one heard you .
really , i can move .
not just leonard and penny &apos;s love ,
but the love we have for them , as well as each other .
speaking of love ,
stds among the elderly are skyrocketing .
love is patient ,
but it &apos;s not gonna put up with all the side chatter ,
so let &apos;s knock it off !
at least she &apos;s yelling at someone else for a change .
howard !
okay , i understand everyone &apos;s a little tense today ,
so i am just gonna get to the important stuff .
leonard , standing here with you
in front of our family and friends
is bringing up a lot of feelings .
like what a good idea it was to elope the first time .
but also how incredibly happy you make me .
thank you for marrying me .
hopefully for the last time .
penny ...
as a scientist ,
my job is to figure out why things happen .
but i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll ever understand
how someone like me
could get to be with someone like you .
you know ... maybe ... i don &apos;t need to understand it ,
i just need to be grateful .
i love you , penny .
anybody have anything snarky to say about that ?
didn &apos;t think so .
i &apos;d like to say something .
beverly ,
i know that we don &apos;t bring out the best in each other .
but something wonderful did come from our relationship :
that young man right there .
i couldn &apos;t agree more .
that &apos;s beautiful .
thank you . all right , let &apos;s continue .
yeah , excuse me , i need to say something
to someone pretty special , and ...
i just can &apos;t wait any longer .
it &apos;s happening .
leonard ...
you and i have our ups and downs .
but i have always considered you my family .
even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating
like wrinkly old rabbits .
i don &apos;t always show it ,
but you are of great importance to me .
both of you .
thank you .
okay .
i now pronounce you husband and wife .
and weird other husband who came with the apartment .
thank you for taking us to the airport .
hey , i &apos;m just thrilled we &apos;re all getting along for a minute .
yeah , me , too .
beverly , i &apos;m sorry if i upset you .
water under the bridge , alfred .
leonard , why don &apos;t you get into the carpool lane ?
well , that &apos;s a solid line . he can &apos;t cross it .
that &apos;s okay . i can make it over .
no , no , let &apos;s plod along .
it &apos;ll make your father feel more comfortable .
what makes me comfortable is knowing i don &apos;t have to
wake up tomorrow morning and see your sour face .
do the world a favor and don &apos;t wake up tomorrow morning .
that was almost a minute .
there &apos;s a lot of traffic . are we gonna be okay ?
you &apos;ll be at the airport an hour before your flight .
good . thank you .
plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy .
hey . i will not have you be disrespectful to me .
yes , ma &apos;am .
sheldon , your mother &apos;s an attractive woman .
you need to get used to the fact
that men are gonna be interested in her .
and you need to drive the car and mind your business .
i will not have you be disrespectful to me .
what-- you &apos;re not my mother .
don &apos;t you be disrespectful to her !
yes , ma &apos;am .
you &apos;ll get there , you &apos;ve just got to put some zing on it .
penny , i don &apos;t know what i was worried about .
your friends are just lovely .
oh , thanks , mom .
although that sheldon is a bit peculiar .
is he ? i never noticed .
he reminds me of that turkey we had
who drowned looking up at the rain .
cops , cops , be cool !
