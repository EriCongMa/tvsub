春田小学舞会
why do i have to go to some stupid dance ?
it makes just standing around with your friends
feel like you &apos;re a loser .
bart , some of your biggest heroes are dancers .
krusty was on dancing with the stars
until a panel of experts determined he wasn &apos;t a star .
dad , help me .
son , for the rest of your life ,
you &apos;re going to go to all sorts of horrible events
just to spend time with girls .
dances , stores , your wedding .
you don &apos;t like those things ?
oh , no . no , no , honey .
i love everything you force me to do .
and sometimes if you do all that ,
you get a very special night .
and what does that get you ?
hopefully , not a you .

your puberty has started !
who the hell are you ?
i am the puberty demon .
for a thousand lifetimes of man ,
i have been going through changes i don &apos;t understand .
you can join me if you just take her hand .
i &apos;d certainly like to help a demon , but i ...
do it . enter the world of body spray ,
wiry hairs and wondering what boobs feel like .
do you know ?

bart simpson .
this is for you .
i &apos;ll meet you outside .
hey , look .
it &apos;s someone who does stuff .
the bullies &apos; natural enemy .
nice dancing , bart.
hey , knock it off !
you &apos;re a real leotard .
that works on two levels .
yeah . just like the old springfield galleria .
do what you want to me . just don &apos;t touch the trophy .
yeah , right .
hi .
this is for you .
let me give you a life lesson .
this isn &apos;t your fault .
but it &apos;s the end of us forever .
oh , uh , hey ... hey , cassidy .
ugh .
sweetie , what happened ?
bullies broke my trophy .
oh , don &apos;t worry .
when you grow up , you &apos;re gonna have a hell of a career .
oh , wait , you &apos;re not the girl .
you &apos;re gonna have a hell of a career .
thank you .
bullying is wrong , and i &apos;m going to work to change it .
if i can get them to open up another register at kroger &apos;s ,
i can do something about this .
wha ... marge , we don &apos;t have kroger &apos;s money .
completing our long @-@ overdue
apologies to the witches and their families .
our final new business is a proposal from marge simpson .
ladies and gentlemen , i &apos;m about to show you
the world &apos;s filthiest word .
oh , boy , i can &apos;t wait to see this word .
you know , i thought you were gonna say
now , midge , uh , thanks for coming and alls , but , uh ,
since frontier days , we &apos;ve needed bullies to steal land
from indians and , uh , uh , punch locusts .
but not anymore .
let &apos;s push bullying to the ground and make it cry
and point and laugh at it .
yeah , yeah ! absolutely !
let &apos;s pass this legislation
without any discussion whatsoever .
so moved . all in favor ?
316 , 317,
318 , 319 to one .
who didn &apos;t vote for it ?
i didn &apos;t .
you better freaking vote for it ,
or we &apos;ll bust your face , you little troll .
the anti @-@ bullying law has passed without objection .
hey , simpson . come over and get your christmas socking .
by the unregulated power
vested in us by the hastily passed bully law ,
you &apos;re under arrest . take &apos; em away , boys .
yeah , grab that hat .
boys , i predict you &apos;re gonna have clear sledding
from here on out . uh , except on those sleds .
uh , i &apos;m gonna need &apos; em as evidence .
uh , is that a candy cane , milhouse ?
&apos;cause , uh , yeah . that @-@ that &apos;s also evidence .
uh , yes , kent , the law gives us broad authority here .
we &apos;re not just going after your garden @-@ variety nurple purpler .
no , no . we &apos;re also arresting adult bullies .
the long @-@ trouser crowd .
and let me tell you , arresting people
who don &apos;t think they &apos;re criminals-- it &apos;s , uh ...
it &apos;s a hell of a lot easier .
all you worthless writers ever do
is stare into your phones .
why don &apos;t you text me some freaking jokes ?
a tv star criticizing his writers .
what has this world come to ?
another bully for your collection , boys .
i need some prison jokes . quick .
how about &quot; orange is the new blecch &quot; ?
beautiful .
uh , yeah . a car just cut me off .
license jdb 653 .
he &apos;s a bully .
oh , and the guy that filled my soda
gave me mostly ice . bully .
mostly ice . dear god .
i &apos;ll never grow a tough enough skin for this job .
excuse me , this is madness .
the ice costs me more than the soda .
do you realize this ?
what hath mom wrought ?
the police are arresting basically anyone they want to .
lisa , you got to learn to trust your government .
that &apos;s what i do .
daddy , can we make cocoa ?
boys , i &apos;m afraid mr. simpson ...
borrowed our mix and our mugs .
why don &apos;t you ask for things back ?
are you being bullied ?
now , boys , i &apos;m just turning the other cheek , like jesus .
do you think he was bullied ?
come on , guys . give it back .
oh ... forgive them , father .
i raised a wuss .
dear lord ,
please demonstrate unto us
uncle homer &apos;s not a jerk .
see you in hell , old bed .
oh , come on , chief . why am i in here ?
you &apos;re a workplace bully .
chief , i put my name on my lunch
because you are always eating it .
bully ! bully ! bully !
springfield pd . chief speaking .
hello ? we &apos;d like to report a bully .
wow . this bully &apos;s going down !
ooh , i wonder who this could be !
homer simpson , i &apos;m here to charge you
with multiple counts of bullying your neighbor , ned flanders .
what the ... ? ! oh , i never dreamed
that a law i had abused could be applied to me !
all right , time for the perp walk .
walk ? but i just watered up the slip &apos;n slide .
i have no comment at this time !
i sentence you to 90 days treatment
in our new biff stiffler bully reeducation center .
is it a school ?
more like a prison .
thank god .
welcome , friends .
welcome . welcome . no need for names .
well , there are need for names ,
or there &apos;d be billions of people
walking around without knowing each other ,
but i meant here .
i know what you &apos;re going through
because i &apos;m a recovering bully myself .
i was bullied for years and years .
i tried to solve it in a way that i don &apos;t suggest .
i shot a man .
but that didn &apos;t fix it .
it fixed it for him . he died .
but i then went to a lot of training .
i went into the army , and i was punished ,
and they told me i got over it .
i don &apos;t feel it , but i &apos;m told i got over it ,
and i have something on the wall
that says i do .
time for step one on the path to empathy , you maggots .
can i do yard work like the kids ?
your work is internal .
you mean like vacuuming ?
did you really think i meant vacuuming ?
when i said &quot; internal , &quot; your brain went
to something inside your house like vacuuming ?
is that what you thought ?
do you know that &apos;s why that dyson is a billionaire ?
something is wrong with you when you think vacuuming .
i &apos;m talking about inside your head .
in your head !
oh , it &apos;s so boring in there .
oh , is it ?
and i thought it might be like the louvre .
now , no more talking !
i know how this works .
you find the toughest one , you crack that person ,
and the rest of you fall in line .
you &apos;ll never crack me .
ah , you &apos;re probably right .
just like you never heard your mother say ,
&quot; i love you . &quot;
there &apos;s not enough tissue in the world for what i &apos;m feeling !
there , there .
the first six tissues are free .
the rest you pay for .
use the first two again .
they don &apos;t seem very wet .
every bully
is woven from the colorful thread
known as humiliation .
gary , who humiliated you ?
my father was a psychologist .
he was a big believer in the methods of b.f. skinner !
i had to go through a hamster maze to get to my breakfast .
which way is love , daddy ?
which way is love ?
he made me go through a maze .
breakthrough .
just sit down , gary .
have the free potato chips .
you , we &apos;ll just heavily medicate .
i &apos;m sorry , there &apos;s no other hope .
give me your money .
oh , beautiful .
you &apos;re just proving my point .
what about you , homer ?
why do you hate this ... flanders ?
well , he thinks he &apos;s so perfect , with his organized garage
and his barbecue grill that never has crud on it .
that &apos;s very good . keep exploring .
i &apos;m already hating him a little bit .
kids who love him and rub his back .
and he &apos;s got enough extra hair for a mustache !
all i got are archie and wicket here .
i &apos;m so bald .
deeper . you &apos;ve got to go deeper !
i &apos;m so bald .
deeper ! and if you think i mean on the ground ,
i &apos;m going to punch you !
why do you hate flanders ?
oh , everybody hates flanders .
no , just you .
that &apos;s right .
great guy .
he ain &apos;t no chooch .
homer , you &apos;ve got to find the answer to this .
it &apos;s been bothering you your whole life .
also , it &apos;s five to 11 : 00 .
i have ten more people before noon !
oh , can you just tell me the answer ?
if i told you the answer ,
then you would not have discovered it for yourself .
did you see that , uh , indiana jones movie ?
did anybody tell him where that thing was ?
does this guy know ?
only you know !
all right .
i hate ned flanders because ...
... because he &apos;s better than me in every way !
i think we have a breakthrough .
i was gonna say that , too .
i used to be a jerk .
i never cared whose feelings i hurt as long as it got a laugh .
i took a thumb when a pinky would do .
but we have learned our lesson , so i hereby promise ...
i promise .
i promise .
te prometo .
we all promise .
to be a better human being .
better human being .
ugh ! once again , people .
all to be a better human being .
better being .
does he have to be in this ?
well , surprisingly , that was our best take .
uh , question : what will this video be used for ?
oh , in schools , by police groups .
cnn . they &apos;re doing a lot of things now
that have nothing to do with news .
this is great . nothing america likes better
than someone who screws up , goes away for a little while ,
then comes back and tells everyone
how to live their lives .
oh , i forgot to include remorse .
oh , it &apos;s okay .
when it kicks in , it &apos;ll be a thousand times worse .
what happened to me ?
my mother told me she loved me .
maybe i couldn &apos;t hear her
because my hand was over her mouth .
let yourself out , please .
and here to throw out the first pitch ,
reformed bully homer simpson .
and the pitch hits the umpire ,
but it &apos;s not an umpire at all .
it &apos;s a returning serviceman from iraq .
and the crowd goes wild .
you &apos;re a hero .
no , you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re the hero . i ...
no , no , you &apos;re wrong . you &apos;re the hero .
i ... no , i just ...
i &apos;m not .
i @-@ i just have a little ptsd .
no , if you see a hero ,
you &apos;re looking into a mirror , man , because you &apos;re the hero .
why is mr. simpson a hero ?
well , i suppose it &apos;s because
he used to be bad and now he &apos;s good .
jenny , the costington &apos;s float contains 10,001 flowers ,
and work started the day after last year &apos;s parade finished .
you say that every year ,
and it &apos;s just not true .
well , there you go again .
daddy , maybe someday you &apos;ll be a hero
like mr. simpson .
he &apos;s a hero , all right .
a hero sandwich full of baloney .
huh . i almost said that in front of the boys !
time i gave that homer a real tongue bath !
ooh . glad i didn &apos;t say that , either .
uh @-@ huh ! uh , wait .
what do you want me to do with this ?
how about writing , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , ned &quot; ?
what are you doing here ?
homer , sorry is not just
the most exciting board game ever devised .
it &apos;s a word i need to hear from you .
fine . sorry . we good ?
no , we &apos;re not good !
you really think one little &quot; sorry &quot; makes up for years of ,
&quot; stupid , stupid , stupid , stupid flanders &quot; ?
i &apos;m starting to think you don &apos;t want an autograph .
this is what i want .
i want you to understand how you make me feel .
homer simpson ,
you made me less of a man in my sons &apos; eyes .
now do you feel remorse ?
oh , my god . i &apos;m a monster .
wait ! you can &apos;t go !
i need your forgiveness !
you can &apos;t push a guy around forever , dad .
you better take a long , fat look in the mirror .
i know .
oh , driveway ! oh !
i crawled here on my knees , all the way from my house ,
to ask for your forgiveness .
well , sir , i appreciate that , but i don &apos;t bend that easily .
well , i &apos;m gonna wait right here on my knees
till you change your mind .
okily @-@ dokily .
on my knees !
mm @-@ hmm . i hear you .
not too comfortable .
nor should it be .
i think he &apos;s suffered enough , daddy .
and he seems to be sinking .
we &apos;re losing him .
&quot; and when you stand praying ,
&quot; if you hold anything against anyone , forgive him ,
so that your father in heaven may forgive you your sins . &quot;
that &apos;s from that ribbon book .
yes , it is , homer .
and i forgive you , transgressoreeno .
now , ned , why don &apos;t you join us for an all @-@ is @-@ forgiven brunch ?
oh , can i make my famous mimosa ?
a little sparkling water and a glass full of regular water ?
stu ... pendous , flanders .
hey , miss drizzle !
otto ! otto !
how many tabs did you take ?
i took a whole sheet of hello kitties !
oh , otto ! that will have
a most deleterious effect on your brain .
the cerebrum , the cerebellum , the medulla .
but why am i telling you about it
when we can visit the inside of your head ?
bus , do your stuff !
aah ! get it out ! get it out !
mr. foreman ?
mr. foreman , please wake up !
aah ! who murdered who again ?
