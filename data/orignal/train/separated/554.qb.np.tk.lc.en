hey , get out of my chair , or i &apos;ll have you disbarred .
oh , wait . that already happened .
cash .
tango .
my old partner in my new firm .
does it get any better ?
not unless you leave .
still got it .
so a little birdie told me
you &apos;re graduating kiddie college .
you must be excited to get that lollipop .
hey . it &apos;s a sticker .
ha . i know you &apos;re busy , not , so allow me to whip it out .
come work with me .
you &apos;ll be a full partner , six figures ,
corner office , three secretaries .
what &apos;s that ? not enough money ?
i &apos;ll double it . bam , done .
that &apos;s how we negotiate . lunch ?
wow . i drive a hard bargain .
but , mark , aren &apos;t you worried i &apos;m a little out of practice ?
the only cases i &apos;ve tried lately are about sandwiches and yams .
please , you were a better lawyer
when you weren &apos;t a lawyer
than most lawyers i know .
it &apos;s still in you .
i &apos;ll give it some thought .
just shake my hand , idiot . it &apos;s simple .
i like simple .
take a look around , winger .
this is your new old life .
i don &apos;t get it .
we just had christmas , and now it &apos;s warm outside .
of course it is , dummy .
we just finished fall @-@ spring semester .
bring on summer @-@ winter .
i can &apos;t wait .
my final film school class is just called opinions .
professor taylor is scheduled to teach ,
but i have a rebuttal .
lucky .
i transferred to forensics late
and got the worst classes .
skull fragment collection , advanced advanced decomp ,
and intro to senselessness were all full .
i still have a year of ac repair left .
i passed all my classes ,
so now i just do yoga
while the teachers write down my wisdoms .
wait a minute . jeff passed history .
he &apos;s graduating early .
i &apos;m totally unprepared to deal with this .
no , annie , please , don &apos;t ...
well , it &apos;s official . it &apos;s on a banner .
congratulations , jeffrey .
you worked hard not to work hard to earn that degree .
yeah , you took so many blow @-@ off classes
and pointless electives .
what did you end up majoring in ?
education .
you had to win , didn &apos;t you ?
when i was inches from the finish line .
pierce , you have so many credits ,
they have grand @-@ credits .
just graduate already .
when &apos;s the graduation ceremony ?
never . it &apos;s community college .
you just send in some papers and they stop charging you .
it &apos;s moving , in its own way .
so this is it ?
a banner and some soda troy forgot to bring ?
no .
as far as graduations go , it &apos;s boring but grounded .
i was hoping for more .
can we at least walk with you to the dean &apos;s office ?
what , now ? no .
i was just ... i was going to mail it in next week ,
or , you know , whenever .
don &apos;t be silly .
we started as a study group ,
we &apos;ll finish as a study group .
all for one , and one dude we can all leave behind .
everybody , go quickly .
go .
go , go , go , go , go , go .
all right , mr. winger . et al . britta .
emotions are running high ,
so i will keep this tight and short .
you always do .
i see you have all the necessary paperwork .
necessary ? you asked for proof of inseam .
ah , jeffrey .
i &apos;m going to miss our playful ,
&quot; get a room already &quot; banter .
oh , dean .
i can come back .
no , i can do this .
just need to sign the old john dean @-@ cock
and you will be graduated .
so this is it ?
i , uh ... i expected a little more pageantry .
i &apos;m listening .
annie &apos;s right .
we should throw a party to mark the occasion .
a small one .
the teensiest .
just close friends , a small cake ...
maybe some flowers , an archway ...
a string quartet .
ooh , he could wear a suit .
starting to sound like a wedding .
not a wedding .
just your average , low @-@ key diploma signing ,
to which you &apos;re all cordially invited tomorrow afternoon .
tomorrow ?
is that enough time to plan a whole wedding ?
absolutely .
i &apos;ll get my book .
listen , i can &apos;t do a big party .
it &apos;s too much .
oh , i see what &apos;s going on here .
this is about you getting cold feet about graduating .
i &apos;ve been looking forward to graduation
since freshman registration .
i already got a job lined up
at my old partner &apos;s firm .
well , then , let them eat cake .
it &apos;s just , i &apos;m worried that the group might not be able
to handle it , you know , emotionally .
everyone wants you to graduate , jeff .
well , what about abed ?
i mean , the stress of me leaving might send him spiraling .
come on , give him some more credit .
he &apos;s really progressed since he opened up to my therapizing .
do you remember last year , when he wouldn &apos;t stop
talking about that &quot; darkest timeline &quot; thing ?
the one where i lost my arm ?
and pierce died , and annie went insane ,
and he blamed it all on you throwing some dice .
he has not brought that up in months .
you &apos;re right , britta .
i just need to give abed a chance .
then it &apos;s settled .
the six of us will take astronomy next semester .
so now you &apos;re leaving me out .
no , we &apos;re leaving jeff out .
so i &apos;m not even the one who gets left out anymore .
everything &apos;s jeff , jeff ...
jeff .
this seat taken ?
so everyone still excited about the big shindig ?
totally .
i was worried about the wedding @-@ graduation mash up ,
but it &apos;s testing really well with women .
oh , well , that &apos;s a load off .
hey , we should probably figure out
who &apos;s bringing the soda now , right ?
just so there &apos;s not another hang up .
i brought it . i @-@ i just drank it all .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;ve got it covered .
no , no , no . you &apos;ve already done so much .
besides , i think i have a fun and fair way
to decide which of the six of us will bring the soda .
we &apos;ll roll for it .
it didn &apos;t land on a number .
that probably means nothing .
or it means everything .
let &apos;s hope not .
you know what , i &apos;ll bring the soda .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;ll make sure there aren &apos;t any more hang @-@ ups .
must i bear this cross forever ?
i was hoping for more .
catherine ?
do not even tell me you dropped that cake .
parasites .
hey . what &apos;s going on ?
why are you trying to avoid graduating ?
i wish i knew .
i think it &apos;s because you &apos;re scared
to take this law job with your old partner .
but don &apos;t let that stop you from graduating .
take the job , don &apos;t take the job .
either way , your friends are always going
to be here to support you .
good to know .
see you at graduation .
and they call us the worst .
took you long enough .
hey , nobody said you had to travel naked .
oh . you brought the good one .
you hold that , i &apos;ll do the sleeve .
wait for the click . there ...
ah . good .
middle finger works great now .
it &apos;s worse than i thought .
they made lame jeff too lame to leave greendale .
he &apos;s got to take that job .
but how do we make him do that ?
by turning the study group against him
so he &apos;ll run screaming from this rancid cocoon
into the welcoming arms of darkness .
how hard is that to understand ?
it &apos;s not .
i just like when you talk down to me like a child .
oh ! jeff .
it &apos;s bad luck to see the graduation
before the graduation .
i had to talk to you .
today is bringing up so many emotions .
it &apos;s a lot to take in .
i &apos;m not making you feel nervous about graduating , am i ?
well , you are making me feel something .
and it &apos;s not about graduating .
i &apos;m saying i &apos;m hot for you .
me ?
is this for real ?
is my beating heart for real ?
oh , annie .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s the beautiful decorations ,
or the impending floral archway ,
but there &apos;s something about this that feels so right .
it &apos;s the perfect moment to remember you by .
remember me by ?
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
exactly . you &apos;re going nowhere .
i &apos;m about to return to my cool , adult , lawyer life ,
and you &apos;re going to be stuck here , playing high school .
why are you saying this ?
so you face the facts .
once i graduate , i &apos;m gone .
winger , streaking on your last day of school ?
respect .
oh , so i got the save the date for your graduation .
should i bring a date , or try to hook up there ?
i &apos;m not going to your stupid graduation , jerk .
i can &apos;t believe you said those things to me .
what things ?
don &apos;t play dumb . you want to leave ? leave .
see if i care .
what did you do ?
i have no earthly idea .
look up there .
hello , abed .
hello , evil jeff .
what ? how did you ...
i may not be good with facial expressions ,
but i know an evil doppelganger when i see one .
plus your arm makes a noise every time you move it .
silence .
are you here to kill jeff ?
oh , you non @-@ evils are so naive .
i &apos;m here to save jeff
from the smothering teat of his study group .
is that a paintball gun ?
you wish .
cool .
wait . cold .
how did i get to the dean &apos;s office ?
out of my chair , monkey .
the darkest timeline .
annie .
um , okay , let &apos;s start with &quot; huh ? &quot;
jeff , i &apos;m sorry . i made it all up .
i &apos;ve been so upset about you graduating
that i &apos;ve gone a little crazy , emotionally .
oh , good . i thought i was losing my mind .
make it up to you with a hug ?
this breakfast sandwich cart is such a great idea .
it &apos;s never too early for shirley ...
to make a boatload off of hung over college kids .
speaking of great idea having , hear me out .
it &apos;s called &quot; the troy @-@ jan horse . &quot;
it goes bread , lettuce , ham , ham , bacon , chocolate ...
oh , how you doing , the graduate ?
just stopping by to hand out some un @-@ vites to my graduation .
here &apos;s one for the desperate housewife
who spends more time with her pathetic business
than with her family .
and you .
if you call a sandwich a &quot; troy @-@ jan horse , &quot;
people are going to think there &apos;s horse in it .
oh , my dreams .
whatever , losers . see you never .
where &apos;s abed ?
is anyone here ?
hello , abed . welcome to our home .
hello , evil abed .
it &apos;s just abed now .
after we met , i abandoned my evil goal
to focus on brightening my own timeline instead .
do you live here alone ?
yes .
evil troy moved out when i gave up the cause .
now he only listens to evil jeff ,
who sort of took over this year , villain @-@ wise .
jeff left greendale and became a scummy lawyer again ,
but the more evil he got ,
the more he became tortured by the idea
that there &apos;s still a good jeff out there , being good somewhere .
that &apos;s why he forced me to show him
how to travel between timelines .
my god . this is so cool .
i know . you have no idea
how long i &apos;ve been waiting to talk to you about it .
kind of a superman iii meets that star trek episode
meets season three of the cape .
the cape was cancelled .
not here .
they retooled it for cable , and it &apos;s awesome .
want to see it ?
desperately .
but i need to get back to my timeline and stop evil jeff .
so i came to the only person who could help me ... me .
i &apos;ll get you home , abed .
but first , you &apos;ll need some supplies .
everyone must be running late .
here , jeffrey . you &apos;re graduated .
take your precious diploma and just go .
i cannot believe the hurtful things
you said to me in my office .
i &apos;ll have you know
that wanting a little pageantry in your life
isn &apos;t a crime or a lifestyle choice .
okay , annie , something definitely weird is happening .
no one &apos;s here , the dean is mad at me ,
and he is never mad at me , and ...
a third reason .
congratulations , jeff .
don &apos;t worry about the study group .
you can talk to them later .
why don &apos;t you and i go celebrate
someplace private and boozy ?
annie , why are you acting like
a mistress in a lifetime movie ?
you &apos;re funny .
oh , sweetheart , you dropped your phone earlier .
you &apos;ve got a voicemail from a guy named mark ?
you should call him .
not now .
i have to find the others and figure this out .
crap . we &apos;re losing him .
what ?
what ?
who are you ?
you are me ?
but how ?
but how ?
enough of the pleasantries .
i &apos;ve come from the darkest timeline
to make sure you take that job .
it &apos;s essential to our future .
you want it , idiot , so take it .
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;ve spent almost four years here ,
growing and changing and making dioramas .
i &apos;m not that guy anymore .
you &apos;re wrong .
greendale may have dulled your killer instinct ,
but trust me , it &apos;s still in you .
it &apos;s time to leave this place and reclaim your proper life .
no . not without my study group .
now who &apos;s in a lifetime movie ?
then i &apos;ll be rid of you another way .
friendship !
cold .
well , the subtle approach failed .
what &apos;s next ? explain it slowly .
need some help ?
let &apos;s burn this mother down .
jeff must be graduating about now
i wonder if anyone &apos;s there .
doubt he cares .
pierce won &apos;t even respond to my texts .
i wonder what terrible things jeff said about him .
i &apos;ve got some guesses .
let me finish .
look , i know this may sound crazy ,
and more than a little convenient ,
but whatever i said to you , it wasn &apos;t me .
it was evil jeff .
come on .
something happened when i rolled that dice .
something terrible .
something only nerds can understand .
you have to believe me .
they &apos;re coming for us .
no .
we &apos;re coming for them .
abed , where have you been ?
the darkest timeline .
you guys never believe me , so this time ,
i brought proof , the doppeldeaner .
abed brought me here to prove to all of you ...
actually , i figured that these paintball warping guns
would convince you .
listen up , people .
we &apos;ve got an inter @-@ dimensional battle on our hands .
our evil counterparts are waging a war ,
and it &apos;s either us or us .
all right .
let &apos;s light up these dark suckers .
okay , everyone . stay sharp .
if you see yourself , warp on sight .
i &apos;d like to warp myself to a dairy @-@ free mudslide .
that &apos;s just vodka , shirley .
i know what it is .
pierce ?
we thought you were dead .
hell , no .
after i got shot , i faked my death
to teach you all a lesson .
lesson about what ?
who can remember ? it was more than a year ago .
and yet , here you all are ,
planning an invasion without me .
again , we thought you were dead .
listen , i @-@ i can help you guys beat the lame study group .
just tell me how this works .
fine .
it &apos;s complicated , but basically ,
the first person to shoot themselves wins .
winner .
well , that bow tied itself .
dang , i got hair dye on my coat .
dang , it &apos;s spreading .
damn it , britta .
did you shoot yourself too ?
every time .
don &apos;t talk to her like that .
every time .
we &apos;re here . scatter .
get help .
can &apos;t hide forever , lame annie .
just let me shoot you .
you &apos;ll love the darkest timeline .
we &apos;re sleeping with jeff there .
what ? we are ?
all the time .
and he loves it .
nobody sleeps with jeff .
not even me .
i &apos;ve been counting bullets .
one of us is out .
is it you ?
yes .
why would you tell me that ?
to sound intimidating .
oh ! almost worked .
ballin &apos; .
okay . only evil jeff is left .
you &apos;ve got to take him out .
why don &apos;t i just give him what he wants ?
what ? you can &apos;t give up now .
why not ?
because it &apos;s not real .
look around , jeff .
haven &apos;t you noticed the vending machines
are full of meats and hard @-@ boiled eggs ?
or that all the background students
are attractive women ?
hi .
yeah .
this is a world you &apos;ve created in your own mind .
the real battle is within .
you &apos;re afraid to graduate because you think
greendale has changed you too much .
so part of you wants evil jeff to win ,
because then you could go backwards
and pretend you &apos;re the same guy you were four years ago .
but you &apos;re not . you &apos;re stronger .
you &apos;re better . you have friends .
no , screw that . you have a family .
wait .
if this is all in my mind ,
then i don &apos;t really need to fight him .
don &apos;t logic this one away from me .
we finally figured out a way to make paintball cool again .
hey , handsome .
on second thought ,
who needs to roll a dime ?
and who cares if we have soda ?
as long as you guys are with me ,
i have everything i need to graduate .
yeah . forget soda .
friends , greendalians , human beings ,
we are gathered here today to honor
that sacred and eternal bond
between a student and his dean .
neither time nor distance nor screening one &apos;s calls
could ever sever what nature herself has ordained .
when two men are drawn ...
i &apos;ll take it from here , craig .
fair enough . i was reaching .
three and a half years ago , when i came to greendale ,
i met six very important people .
ooh . burn on britta .
sorry , seven .
and meeting these people changed my life .
yep .
i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i don &apos;t know what to say .
yeah , okay .
whatever .
i &apos;m so used to being the guy
who can talk his way out of anything ,
but what do you say when you don &apos;t want a way out ?
what you all have done for me is indescribable .
it &apos;s unbelievable .
and my love for you is immeasurable ,
even when you split it seven ways .
well said , jeffrey .
if anyone here should have just cause
why jeffrey tobias winger should not be graduated ,
speak now or forever ...
pierce .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
i &apos;m ready to graduate .
yeah ?
well , i &apos;m ready to graduate first .
seems oddly appropriate .
congratulations , pierce .
perfect .
so what &apos;s next for jeffrey winger ?
i &apos;m thinking i might look into some small local firms .
i &apos;m going to use my big mouth to help the little guy .
plus , if i stay in town ,
i can pop by any time i want .
you know , just to settle any group arguments
about who misses me the most .
what do you think ?
to jeff .
to jeffrey .
troy and abed in the morning .
welcome back .
we &apos;ve got a jam @-@ packed show , so let &apos;s get started .
today , as always ,
we &apos;ll be visited once again
by greendale &apos;s king and supreme lord master ,
dean chang .
looks like he &apos;ll be talking about squash this time .
oh , i &apos;m super excited for that .
and not only because it &apos;s mandatory .
but first , we &apos;ll take a spin around the timeline map
and find out what &apos;s happening in the universes
that parallel ours .
thanks , us .
i &apos;m standing here in timeline five ,
where things are pretty much normal .
normal ?
troy , people are on fire in nairobi .
you call that normal ?
i &apos;ve become much more conscious of world issues
since troy and i decided to give our baby an african name .
isn &apos;t that right , chewbacca ?
it means , &quot; he who hunts bounties . &quot;
back to you .
wow , it sounds like things are really heating up in nairobi .
that &apos;s nothing compared to the fire in our studio audience .
hey , idiots .
how many times have i told you ,
the show doesn &apos;t really exist .
no one &apos;s watching .
duh @-@ doy . we know .
yeah , we &apos;re just messing around .
see you at lunch , evil jeff .
see you at lunch .
troy and abed in the morning .
第四季第十三集 &#91; 本季完 &#93; 感谢与你一路相伴 再见
