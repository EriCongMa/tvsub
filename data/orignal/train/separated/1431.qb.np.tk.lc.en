morning .
hey .
you sleep all right ?
no , you ?
say no , phil .
of course no .
i missed you up there .
last night , i know i got kind of carried away --
no , no , no . you don &apos;t need to apologize .
i don &apos;t think that i was apologi--
you were right to be mad .
sometimes i just feel like i have to scream
to let you know how upset i am ,
but you get it now , right ?
i ... do .
not .
no idea whatsoever .
ohh , if i knew , but ...
no .
good .
so let &apos;s pretend the whole thing never happened .
what were we even fighting about , huh ?
what the heck happened in here ?
the raccoon get through the dog door again ?
yep . the raccoon got in ,
and your mom fought it off with the fire extinguisher .
you &apos;re a mess !
are you okay ?
careful , buddy . not today .
i think you look beautiful .
save it .
one time i forgot to get gloria a birthday present ,
and i paid for it .
another time i remembered , but she didn &apos;t like the gift .
i paid for that .
so you &apos;d think when i remember to buy her a gift
and she loves it ,
i wouldn &apos;t have to pay for it , right ?
just call me angel of the morning , angel
just touch my cheek before you leave me , baby
oh , hey , good .
grab the other end of this and help me get it out of here .
i have to start setting up the chairs for tonight .
oh , tonight ? what &apos;s tonight ?
are you kidding me ?
this is what i &apos;m talking about mitchell .
you never listen when i --
it &apos;s a fundraiser for the friends
of the third street overpass music society .
two harpists are performing ,
and you &apos;re anxious &apos; cause andrew ,
your nemesis from the steering committee ,
ran the event last year ,
and you want to upstage him .
i was kidding .
cam has it in his head
that i don &apos;t listen to him , but i do .
do you , mitchell ? do you ?
the doctor called and said
lily &apos;s rash is just dry skin .
i &apos;m so relieved .
what did i just say ?
you act like you listen to every single thing that i say ,
but you don &apos;t .
don &apos;t i , mitchell ?
hey , i &apos;m going to the store today .
do you need me to pick anything up for you ?
razor blades , saline solution , black socks ,
and the new issue of vanity fair .
wow . i don &apos;t even remember asking for all that .
thank you .
don &apos;t i ?
how &apos;d this thing come off , anyway ?
well , i was cooking dinner , and --
right .
and the raccoon just walked in the --
and i already had the door open .
right . - which i @-@ i had already had ahold of the --
why don &apos;t you two go work on your story and come back ?

oh , yeah . cam hired luke
to help out with the benefit tonight .
hey , you know what ? i can &apos;t fix this thing .
what ? i need that . i use it every day .
okay , phil , what do you say ?
you want to take a trip to the mall with me ?
i ... do .
not ,
if i can possibly avoid it .
claire has this little ... habit ...
at the mall , where sh--
i can &apos;t even talk about it .
jay , come on !
i want to go home
because you said you were going to film me doing the
karaoke so i can send it to colombia to my mother .
claire , um , about the mall ?
i was actually gonna run out
and get my hair cut this afternoon .
well , hang on here .
why don &apos;t i run claire down the mall ,
and you give phil a haircut ?
you &apos;re always talking about
how you miss working at the salon .
i guess i could .
i do jay . why can &apos;t i do you ?
you ... can do me .
okay , let &apos;s get this party started .
you know that song ?
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go ! we &apos;re wasting time !
o @-@ okay , okay .
yeah .
you know it ?
i think i do .
so , that was andrew ,
who practically choked telling me
that no one had called in their regrets
for the event tonight .
it is gonna be a full house .
oh , that must feel great !
oh , i never thought i would enjoy having an arch enemy . oh .
but i do , mitchell . i do . hmm .
hey , lily , what you got there ?
i do feel bad for those peta folks .
their event &apos;s tonight , too .
that &apos;s why i had you mail the invitations so long ago .
i shouldn &apos;t laugh .
i do feel bad for those little peta animals .
i really do .
what are you doing ?
nothing . she was , uh --
she was , uh , sucking her thumb again .
yes , i put cam &apos;s invites in my car
to take them to the post office
and then threw my gym bag on top of them
and completely forgot they existed .
ohh , i feel terrible .
haven &apos;t been to the gym in six weeks .
and i ruined cam &apos;s event .
hello , miss hartwick .
uh , cam and i are hosting
a little event tonight , and --
yes , yes .
no , i am aware that there is also a peta event ,
and -- ohh .
who are you talking to ?
i &apos;m in the shower !
luke , how are those chairs coming ?
come in .
i think you should come in come in .
oh , now i &apos;m worried about the flow .
the eyes should go to the harps , not the backs of chairs .
are you gonna get upset
and starting eating all the appetizers again ?
it is amazing what you notice and what you don &apos;t notice .
please handle that . i need to think .
come on , luke .
hi , there . your father home ?
i think so . why ?
oh , oh ! the wait staff .
please , luke , show them to the kitchen , please .
knock knock .
oh . hello , andrew .
nice chair backs .
i just thought you could use this .
it &apos;s the sign @-@ in book for my event last year .
let just turn to the blank pages ,
which should be ...
oh . no . it &apos;s full .
oh , well , thank you for thinking of us ,
but shouldn &apos;t you be getting back home to donald ?
that is the name of your cat , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;ll see you at 7 : 00 .
drive safely .
what did i tell you ?
she &apos;s even worse than you said .
hold still !
you can &apos;t move like that .
it &apos;s like cutting the hair of a cuckoo bird .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just a little tense today .
i knew it . something happened .
because when somebody works in a salon ,
they know when someone needs to talk .
actually , you might be able to help me with this one .
claire and i got into a huge fight last night ...
... and i &apos;m not even sure what it was about .
was that why you didn &apos;t want to go to the mall with her ?
no , that was ... more about a weird ...
mall habit claire has .
oh , my god ! that &apos;s good !
oh , oh ! go low , go low .
go low , go low . oh ! oh !
oh , my god !
dad ! dad !
you got to get one of these ! oh !
it is impressive how much haley &apos;s earning .
she &apos;s over $ 500 already .
that &apos;s a lot of cheddar .
why &apos;s everyone acting
like she &apos;s the first 17 @-@ year @-@ old to have a job ?
in other cultures , she &apos;d have two kids already ,
and they &apos;d have jobs .
you know , i stopped by the restaurant a couple times ,
and she wasn &apos;t there .
when ?
uh , i don &apos;t remember .
i was at the mall for a movie .
think ! i need details !
okay , it was a romantic comedy
my now ex @-@ friend reuben recommended --
not about the movie ! what day ? ! focus !
okay , uh , it was tuesday ,
but i also ate there again on saturday ,
and she wasn &apos;t there then , either .
oh , my god .
i bet she doesn &apos;t even work there .
well , then , where &apos;s all this money coming from ?
do you notice how every single night
is just under $ 60 ?
grandpa gave her $ 60 for her birthday .
she &apos;s just hanging around the mall all day ,
flashing the same cash every night ,
and fooling my parents into buying her a car .
hey , dad !
can we eat at haley &apos;s restaurant tonight ? !
hey , there &apos;s a good idea !
great . i &apos;ll text her .
oh , god , no !
oh , god , yes !
oh ! oh , god , yes !
oh , get after it !
amazing .
i &apos;m going for 15 more on me .
i think you got what you needed from that .
oh . okay . thank you .
you know , maybe you do need to talk about this fight .
with phil ?
how could you not know what she was mad about ?
because she didn &apos;t tell me . she just freaked out .
i cannot believe you , phil !
how could you ? !
what is happening ? what -- what did i do ?
are you serious ?
you are ! you don &apos;t know .
we &apos;ve had this conversation a hundred times .
you know -- no , no .
i &apos;m not -- i &apos;m not doing this again .
you tell me what you did .
was it -- - &quot; was it -- &quot;
no , phil .
no . no , no , no . no !
i &apos;m going to get some air .
claire .
claire !
no ! don &apos;t follow me .
happy valen @-@ birth @-@ iversary !
storming off --
right out of yr mom &apos;s playbook .
where &apos;d you go ?
well , as it turns out , not very far .
damn it .
phil !
phil , you moron , stop it !
it &apos;s me , you idiot !
i &apos;m sorry !
what are you doing ? !
i &apos;m sorry !
i thought you were a raccoon !
you thought i was a raccoon !
because people look so much like raccoons .
oh , look .
there &apos;s one now !
no , claire , no ! claire !
wait a minute .
not even crazy woman go crazy for no reason .
what happened before the broccoli ?
that &apos;s just it -- it came out of the blue .
i walked in the door ,
we &apos;re having a conversation about nothing .
hey , honey .
sorry i got stuck at the office .
how was your day ?
it was good .
although you know what ?
what ?
debbie stood me up for lunch .
rude , right ?
no . she called .
i didn &apos;t get a message .
yeah . you did .
i left you one .
it &apos;s right ... there .
that &apos;s it !
how is she supposed to see this ?
if you give me a message this tiny ,
i kill you .
but that &apos;s not when she got mad .
also , i talked to the insurance company
about that little accident that &quot; wasn &apos;t your fault &quot;
because the brakes weren &apos;t &quot; working right . &quot;
and that &apos;s not gonna cost us as much money as i thought ,
so that &apos;s good .
that &apos;s it !
you insult a woman &apos;s driving ,
and you use the &quot; air bunnies . &quot;
you do that to me , and i kill you .
i hear you ,
but the screaming still hadn &apos;t started yet .
so , i &apos;m having lunch with skip woosnum , right ?
boy , can that guy go on and on .
tangent after tangent .
by the way , turned me on to the greatest thing --
wedge salad -- you gotta try it .
anyhoo ...
guess who &apos;s sitting at the table next to us .
my old girlfriend carla .
we &apos;re gonna grab coffee .
she lost a ton of weight .
how stupid are you ?
you tell me that you &apos;re seeing an old girlfriend , and i --
kill me , i know .
but she still hadn &apos;t snapped yet .
i almost forgot .
i picked up the broccoli you asked for .
cauliflower .
can &apos;t believe i did that again .
i cannot believe you , phil !
you didn &apos;t do one thing wrong .
you do everything wrong !
i don &apos;even know why she talks to you .
she said she was okay .
no . no woman is okay with this .
we don &apos;t forget .
we wait .
and then , when you least expect it ,
we make you pay .
chin up !
up !
so you had a meltdown over that .
i did , because ever since i met him ,
i &apos;ve been trying to get phil to try a wedge salad .
the minute that skip woosnum ,
whom he doesn &apos;t even like , suggests it ,
phil thinks it &apos;s the greatest thing ever ,
and he does this with everything .
he does it with books , with movies , with tv .
he listens to everybody &apos;s opinion but mine ,
and it drives me crazy .
you two seemed fine this morning .
well , we were because we talked about it ,
which , by the way ,
if you want this whole karaoke thing with gloria to go away ,
that &apos;s what you need to do .
that &apos;s easier said than done .
well , since when do you shy away from confrontation ,
mr. tough talk , mr. straight shooter ?
getting a little soft , grandpa ?
you know , when you get a massage ,
you sound like a tijuana prostitute .
luke , phone .
friends of the third street --
is that mitchell ? what &apos;s taking him ?
no , it &apos;s not mitchell . it &apos;s ...
i don &apos;t understand his name .
hello ?
oh , hi , longinus . listen ,
did you get my message ?
about the chiavari chairs --
i want you to bring them when you come .
what do you mean you &apos;re not -- not coming ?
well , that &apos;s not possible .
mitch -- mitch mailed them weeks ago .
what about pepper ? did he get his ?
and michael ?
and steven and stefan ?
and bob ?
i have to go .
get me your uncle mitchell .
i don &apos;t know his number .
it went to voicemail .
of course it did .
keep trying him until you get him .
it &apos;s one button .
just ... redial .
hey , really great event tonight
benefiting the music society -- musicians like you .
uncle cam for uncle mitchell .
how could you , mitchell ? !
honestly ! give me that .
you want to hear the guest list for night ?
so far it &apos;s anger , betrayal , terror , and sadness .
congratulations , mitchell , you packed the house !
cam , i am so sorry .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m gonna fix it . i &apos;ll make a big donation .
that &apos;s not gonna keep them
from kicking me off the steering committee !
when andrew walks in here
and sees a room full of empty chairs --
you know he &apos;s not really your archenemy .
that &apos;s sort of a made @-@ up thing .
fix it !
hi ! you came !
hi !
of course we did . we wanted to see you work .
we &apos;re so proud of you , sweetheart .
yeah , we &apos;re all proud . so where &apos;s our table ?
actually , bad news .
we totally booked .
we have a ton of reservations .
yeah , one &apos;s ours . i called .
here it is !
uh , so , your table is right here .
oh , honey , would you mind getting us a couple drinks ?
i would love an iced tea .
same , please .
i &apos;ll have a mango @-@ kiwi smoothie ,
yogurt instead of ice cream , and make it low @-@ fat .
i want to look good when i &apos;m riding in your new car .
honey , i got to say ,
i like this haircut .
hey , we &apos;re all just playing for second in this family .
were you all done here ?
uh , actually , no .
um , i will have more iced tea ,
another iced tea ,
and a mango @-@ kiwi smoothie ,
all ice cream .
i &apos;m pregnant .
well , this is nice .
me , my gals ,
and my beautiful , beautiful wife .
just so you know , i rescheduled with carla .
i penciled her in for the 12th ...
of never .
that &apos;s too bad .
i was kind of looking forwd to hearing about that one .
by the way ,
no one called for you while you were out .
thank you ?
i just want to make sure you get any messages
from any friends who might call , which none of them did .
isn &apos;t it weird that haley &apos;s the only one here
not wearing a name tag ?
if your mother had a name tag ,
it would say &quot; good driver . &quot;
phil -- - here you go .
i want to hear the specials .
uh , we &apos;re out of specials .
what were they ?
popular , which you wouldn &apos;t understand .
well , what could be better
than drinks with a beautiful woman ?
and every beautiful woman deserves flowers .
cauliflowers .
okay . what &apos;s going on ? is this about last night ?
yeah , i just want you to know how important to me you are .
sweetie , i know that . i know that .
i still feel bad about , you know
what i ... did .
listen to me .
you and i are fine .
okay ?
i &apos;m just really hungry .
okay ?
okay .
okay .
all right !
what looks good ?
oh , gosh .
ooh , here &apos;s something that jumps right off the page .
uh @-@ huh . i tried this yesterday ,
thanks to my good friend skip woosnum .
claire , do yourself a favor
and join me in a wedge salad .
you have got to be kidding me !
just try it . you will thank me .
did you learn nothing from last night ?
it was about the salad ?
i have been recommending wedge salads to you ,
amongst other things , for years ,
and you never listen to me .
and then some idiot suggests it ,
and you can &apos;t wait to try a wedge salad ? !
it makes me feel like i don &apos;t matter .
thanks a lot , dad !
mom &apos;s little outburst just got me fired !
okay , i got to talk to your mom .
you comfort your sister .
she never worked here !
so , mitchell called you , too .
i take it you haven &apos;t had your conversation with gloria yet ?
it &apos;s getting worse .
she sang all the way here .
we passed two cars --
the dogs stuck their heads back inside the window .
what are we gonna do ?
i could start a fire .
no .
keep that in your back pocket .
i want to show you something .
let me guess .
it &apos;s a copy of &quot; the book thief &quot;
that i begged you to read ,
but you wouldn &apos;t until your dental hygienist
said it changed her life .
remember this ?
uh @-@ huh .
it &apos;s the first thanksgiving i spent with your family .
god , i hated that ponytail .
i know .
you said it made me look like a wimpy bouncer ,
so i cut it off .
just like i lost the feathered earring ...
and the van with the beanbag chairs .
and i changed my forestry major .
i get it , phil . i get it .
i am the controlling witch
that made you give up everything fun in your l--
no . no .
you &apos;re the witch who saved me .
look . look at this picture .
now look at this guy .
you can &apos;t tell me your opinion doesn &apos;t matter .
you changed me for the better in a hundred different ways .
yeah , i @-@ i might miss a book or a salad
here and there , but ...
i &apos;ve got claire all over me .
you &apos;re about to .
that &apos;s the worst sound in the world .
is it ?
friends , uh , family , uh , board members --
&quot; bored &quot; is right .
i know we were all looking forward
to hearing the beautiful stylings of harp attack ,
but there has , unfortunately , been a slight --
don &apos;t start yet !
delay ,
and the program will start in a few minutes , on time .
uh , so , please , everyone take their seats .
thank you .
oh , my god , you did it !
sort of .
i know this isn &apos;t what you were hoping for ,
but i need to do a better job of listening to you .
no , no , you did the best you could ,
and , plus , this is double what andrew had last year
for &quot; cello submarine . &quot;
thank you .
oh -- how are you sitting at a harp
and not scoring this moment ? ladies !
you can &apos;t have a successful marriage
without being a good listener .
sometimes it takes a little work ...
i just wonder what they &apos;re gonna do
with their lives , you know ?
i just wonder how they can actually , you know ,
ever find their true calling with a harp .
... sometimes it takes a lot of work ...
harps !
... and sometimes it &apos;s just excruciating .
jay , come . i work out another song .
gloria .
gloria .
no !
no , no , no , no , no , no , no !
i can &apos;t take it anymore !
okay ? it &apos;s not singing , it &apos;s screaming .
mom , i love you , but for the love of god ,
destroy that thing before it destroys this family !
coward !
i think you sound great ,
but if it bothers e kid ...
coward !
oh danny boy
the pipes , the pipes are calling
from glen to glen , and down the mountain side
the summer &apos;s gone , and all the roses ...
you keep this up ,
