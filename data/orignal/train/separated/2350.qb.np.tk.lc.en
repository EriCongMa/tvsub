for over a century , i have lived in secret .
until now .
i know the risk , but i have to know her .
what are you ?
i &apos;m a vampire .
tell me about your ex , katherine .
you must be elena .
how do we look exactly alike ?
the lockwoods are werewolves .
tell me what triggers the curse !
you have to kill somebody !
paralyzed from the waist down .
and dead .
matt failed . i can &apos;t .
tyler , what &apos;s happening ?
get away ! get away !
what &apos;s happening ? !
we were stupid , sneaking around , thinking we weren &apos;t gonna get caught .
but it &apos;s over .
you need me . elena &apos;s in danger .
she &apos;s the doppelganger . she needs to be protected .
then i &apos;ll protect her .
please , damon .
where is she ?
in the trunk . i did exactly what you said .
good . put her in the back .
thank you for your help .
is there anything else ?
one more thing . come closer . please .
closer .
yo , elena !
so , sarah attacks tyler , and he pushed her away ,
and she tripped , and she fell , and she hit her head .
does matt remember anything ?
mmm , he thinks he blacked out .
mmm . but i think--
i think they were both compelled by katherine .
that &apos;s why i covered for tyler and said it was an accident .
yeah , i don &apos;t understand that . the guy &apos;s a tool .
well , gee , duh .
tyle &apos;s getting blamed for sarah &apos;s death
just opens up questions that he can &apos;t answer .
and do you really think it &apos;s a good idea
for him to tell his mom he &apos;s a werewolf ?
well , no .
and that werewolf road leads straight to vampire boulevard .
i thought i was thinking fast on my feet .
where &apos;s your mom ?
leading the search party for aimee bradley .
they haven &apos;t found her body yet .
oh , teens today and their underage drinking . tragic .
wait . did you see tyler &apos;s eyes turn yellow ?
more gold with amber highlights .
can he turn into a wolf now ?
only on a full moon ,
but now he has increased strength and who knows what else .
i wonder what mason told him .
does he know about us ?
hey . what &apos;d you tell him ?
nothing , really .
i--i don &apos;t think he knows much of anything .
he seemed really freaked out , and honestly ...
i felt kinda bad for him .
he &apos;s gotta know something .
all right . i &apos;ll ask him .
no , you won &apos;t , caroline .
he cannot know about us .
a bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire .
so don &apos;t be his friend . do you understand me ?
i understand .
i &apos;m late for school .
right .
if you want to drop the hint to your mom ,
aimee &apos;s body is at the bottom of the ravine with a cracked spine .
might save your mom some time .
hey , jeremy .
look , elena &apos;s gotta let me know if i &apos;m supposed to cover for her .
i mean , jenna &apos;s cool with the two of you , but you guys are pushing it .
what are you talking about ?
you and elena .
look , i &apos;m glad you guys are back together ,
but if she &apos;s gonna sleep ove ...
wait , wait .
hold on a minute . we &apos;re not back together .
wait . she didn &apos;t-- she didn &apos;t stay at your place last night ?
no . i mean , i saw her at the party , but that was it .
she didn &apos;t sleep over .
&apos;cause her bed hadn &apos;t been slept in ,
and mrs. lockwood said that her car was still in the driveway .
where is she , then ?
please .
what do you want ?
shh .
please , i &apos;m hurt .
i know .
uhh . just a taste .
aah ! aah !
trevor !
control yourself .
buzz kill .
what do you want with me ?
my god , you look just like her .
but i &apos;m not . please , whatever you want--
be quiet .
but i &apos;m not katherine .
my name is elena gilbert . you don &apos;t have to do this .
i know who you are . i said be quiet .
what do you want ?
i want you to be quiet .
this has katherine written all over it .
katherine &apos;s in the tomb .
trust me . i &apos;m the one that shut her in .
did you ?
did i what , stefan ?
well , i know the hold that katherine has on you .
she &apos;s in the tomb .
period . end of story .
but she did say something to me right before i shut her in .
i thought she was lying .
what did she say ?
elena &apos;s in danger .
what , and you didn &apos;t think you should ask her to elaborate ?
everything she says is a lie .
how am i supposed to know if she &apos;s gonna start spouting off the truth ?
we have to go talk to her .
no , no . let me tell you how that &apos;s gonna go .
we &apos;re gonna go ask her for help .
she &apos;s gonna negotiate her release ,
which we &apos;re gonna be dumb enough to give her ,
and then she &apos;s gonna get out and kill us .
that &apos;s exactly what she wants .
i don &apos;t really care .
bad idea , stefan .
it &apos;s elena .
caroline .
hey . how are you doing ?
not good .
how &apos;s your mom ?
my mom said that she was pretty freaked out
about everything that happened with sarah .
how did you know ?
what do you mean ?
about me .
how did you know ?
know what ? that you were upset ?
i thought i was doing a good thing by covering for you .
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m talking about .
look , it was an accident .
ok ? and i &apos;ve gotta run .
just please don &apos;t blame yourself .
how &apos;s it go ?
still pass out .
you didn &apos;t touch her , did you ?
give me some credit .
so you called him ?
no , il called one of his contacts .
you know how this works .
look , did you or did you not get the message to elijah ?
they say he got it .
wonderful . and what ?
so , that &apos;s it , trevor .
he either got it , or he didn &apos;t .
we just have to wait .
look , it &apos;s not too late .
we can leave her here .
we don &apos;t have to go through with this .
i &apos;m sick of running .
yeah ? well , running keeps us from dying .
elijah is old school .
if he accepts our deal , we &apos;re free .
you !
there &apos;s nothing around here for miles .
if you think you &apos;re getting out of this house ,
you &apos;re tragically wrong . understand ?
who &apos;s elijah ?
he &apos;s your worst nightmare .
i can &apos;t undo the tomb spell , stefan ,
even if i wanted to .
it took both me and my grams to do it the first time .
all right , but i can open the door , though , right ?
i could talk to her ?
yeah , but damon &apos;s right .
she &apos;s not gonna tell you anything ,
not without something in return .
i know . but , bonnie , i have to do something .
i have no idea who has elena .
i have no idea where she is .
what if there was another way to find her ?
how does this work ?
i &apos;ll use your blood to draw the energy for the tracking spell .
you &apos;re blood @-@ related . it &apos;ll make the connection stronger .
all right , alaric said we gotta clear out of here within 10 minutes .
i got weapons . he stocked me up .
are you ready ?
there .
she &apos;s there .
that &apos;s 300 miles away .
no , bonnie , we need a more exact location than that .
that &apos;s as close as i can get .
we can map it an aerial view .
it &apos;ll show us what &apos;s around there ,
help us narrow down the area .
perfect .
call me with whatever you find .
no , no .
i &apos;m coming with you .
no , jeremy , you &apos;re not .
i &apos;m not gonna just sit here . what if she &apos;s hurt , ok ?
or worse ? what if she &apos;s ...
she &apos;s not . you two go back to your house just in case .
i &apos;m gonna call you the minute i find her .
but you can &apos;t do this alone .
he &apos;s not . let &apos;s go .
you &apos;re coming with me ?
it &apos;s elena .
du , what the hell was that ? where did that come from ?
how did you do that ?
hi , tyler . where you goin &apos; ?
come on , man . do what we got , play the game .
hey . um , are ... you ok ?
you lied to me earlier . why ?
look . tyler ...
i think that you misunderstood me at the party .
i get it . it was very traumatic .
you &apos;re lying .
nope . but i &apos;m late .
how did you ...
you &apos;re stronger than me ?
please . that was nothing .
listen , if you know something , you gotta tell me ,
because i can &apos;t handle this .
i &apos;m sorry , tyler ,
but i think that you &apos;re still in shock over sarah dying .
and it &apos;s understandable .
alaric sure ikes his weapons .
what the hell is that ?
well , it &apos;s a vervain bomb or grenade launch
or something like that .
weird .
hey , how much further is it ?
about 80 miles .
who do you think took her ?
someone from katherine &apos;s past .
she said she was running from someone .
maybe they got the wrong girl .
thank you for helping me .
can we not do the whole road @-@ trip bonding thing ?
the clich of it all makes me itch .
oh , come on , damon .
we both know that you being in this car
has absolutely nothing to do with me , anyway .
the elephant in the room lets out a mighty roar .
well , it doesn &apos;t have to be an elephant .
let &apos;s talk about it .
there &apos;s nothing to talk about .
that &apos;s not true . sure there is .
let &apos;s get it out . i mean , are you in this car
because you want to help your little brother save a girl that he loves ,
or is it .. is it because you love her , too ? hmm ?
i mean , come on . express yourself .
i happen to like road @-@ trip bonding .
keep it up , stefan . i can step out of helping as easily as i stepped in .
nope . see , that &apos;s the beauty of it .
you can &apos;t .
alaric just left with jenna .
he &apos;s getting her out of the house for a while
so she doesn &apos;t ask questions about elena .
look , i pulled this up based on that spot on the map .
there &apos;s nothing for miles except for this old house .
did you send it to stefan ?
yeah .
i hate sitting here , waiting like this .
she &apos;s gonna be fine .
you don &apos;t know that .
no , i don &apos;t .
what are you doing ?
i have something else i want to try .
i don &apos;t get it .
i need a candle . grab elena &apos;s hairbrush .
ok , yeah .
what &apos;s all this stuff for ?
i know it &apos;s crazy ,
but i might be able to get her a message .
bonnie ?
bonnie .
bonnie . bonnie !
bonnie .
bonnie .
bonnie !
bonnie ! bonnie !
why am i here ?
you keep asking me these questions
like i &apos;m gonna answer them .
why won &apos;t you ?
that &apos;s another one .
you got me .
ok ? it &apos;s not like i can go anywhere .
the least you can do is tell me what you want with me .
i personally want nothing .
i &apos;m just a delivery service .
delivery to who ? elijah ?
ah heh . 2 points to the eavesdropper .
who is he ?
is he a vampire ?
he &apos;s one of the vampires , the originals .
what do you mean , the originals ?
again with the questions . haven &apos;t the salvatores
been teaching you your vampire history ?
so , you know stefan and damon .
i know of them . a hundred years back ,
a friend of mine tried to set me up with stefan .
she said he was one of the good ones .
i &apos;m more of a sucker for the bad boys , though ,
but i digress .
who are the originals ?
trevor and i have been running for 500 years .
we &apos;re tired . we want it over .
we &apos;re using you to negotiate ourselves out of an old mess .
but why me ?
because you &apos;re a petrova doppelganger .
you &apos;re the key to breaking the curse .
curse ?
the sun and the moon curse ?
ohh . you do know your history .
what do you mean i &apos;m the key ?
the moonstone is what breaks the curse .
no . the moonstone is what binds the curse .
sacrifice is what breaks it .
sacrifice ?
the blood of the doppelganger .
you &apos;re the doppelganger .
aka , in order to break the curse ,
you &apos;re the one that has to die .
mom ?
what are you doing here ?
i know .
breaking and entering the sheriff &apos;s house ?
that move will win you an award .
go ahead . keep dodging .
keep changing the subject .
but i know .
you &apos;re just like me . aren &apos;t you ?
no .
keep it up , but i &apos;m not buying it .
i saw how strong you were .
i &apos;m not leaving here until you tell me the truth .
tyler ...
you &apos;re a werewolf . say it .
what ?
stop lying .
i &apos;m not lying .
say it !
i &apos;m not a werewolf . ok ?
tell me more .
captivity has made her pushy , eh ?
what do you want to know , doppelicious ?
who are you running from ?
the originals .
yeah , she said that . what does that mean ?
the first family--
the old world-- rose and i pissed &apos; em off .
correction-- i pissed them off .
rose had my back . and for over half a millennium ,
they &apos;ve wanted us dead .
what did you do ?
he made the same mistake countless others did .
he trusted katerina petrova .
katherine .
the one and only-- the first petrova doppelganger .
i helped her escape her fate .
and now i &apos;ve-- sorry , we &apos;ve-- been marked ever since .
which is why we &apos;re not gonna make the same mistake again .
here . drink this .
thanks .
what happened ? you scared the hell out of me .
it &apos;s nothing .
it wasn &apos;t nothing , bonnie .
i &apos;ve been doing a lot of magic lately .
it wears me down .
when i &apos;m worn down , i take a nap .
you were-- you were unconscious .
witchcraft has its limits .
if i push too hard , it pushes back .
how do you know all this ?
it &apos;s all in here .
it &apos;s like a reminder that i &apos;m not invincible .
please ...
don &apos;t--don &apos;t tell anyone .
why not ? because it &apos;s a weakness ,
and i don &apos;t want certain people to know that .
by certain people , you mean damon .
i mean anyone that could hurt me .
i won &apos;t tell anyone , ok ? i promise .
it &apos;s hard , you know ?
my grams is gone , and my dad ,
he doesn &apos;t want to know about what i am .
he hasn &apos;t since my mom left .
i &apos;m all alone in this .
that &apos;s how i feel a lot of the time ,
alone .
uh , you--you think that worked ?
i have no idea .
we &apos;re gettin &apos; close .
jeremy said there &apos;s an access road just past mile marker 6 .
if you want some , just ask .
i want some .
aw , that &apos;s so sweet .
gonna be all big and strong to save your girl .
well , don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ve got your back . you &apos;ll be fine .
i &apos;m not joking .
i been drinking a little every day ,
slowly increasing my intake and building up my strength .
does elena know you &apos;re drinking blood ?
i &apos;ve been drinking hers .
how romantic .
since we &apos;re road @-@ trip bonding ,
remember the days when all you lived for was blood ,
you were the guy who would rip someone apart just for the fun of it ?
you mean when i was more like you ?
yes , stefan . exactly .
back when you put blood into me so i could be a big , bad vampire .
wonder if elena would be so quick
to open her veins to that guy ?
by the way , what happened to that guy ?
he was a hoot .
guess he found something else to live for .
he &apos;s here .
this was a mistake .
no , i told you i would get us out of this .
you have to trust me .
no ! he wants me dead , rose !
he wants her more .
i can &apos;t do this . you give her to him , he &apos;ll have mercy on you ,
but i need to get out of here .
hey . what are we ?
we &apos;re family .
forever .
you &apos;re scared .
stay here with her
and don &apos;t make a sound .
rosemary .
is there somewhere we can talk ?
yes .
in here .
you h @-@ have to forgive the house .
oh , no . what &apos;s a little dirt ?
i completely understand .
so tell me , what is it that gives you the courage to call me ?
i wanted my freedom .
i &apos;m tired of running .
you &apos;re in a position to grant me that .
i have complete authority to grant pardon to you and your little pet .
what is his name these days ? trevor .
if i so see fit .
katerina petrova ?
i &apos;m listening .
she didn &apos;t burn in the church in 1864 .
continue .
she survived .
where is she ?
you don &apos;t seem surprised by this .
oh , when you called and invited me into this armpit of civilization ,
which is a mere 3 hours from the town we know as mystic falls ,
i surmised it had everything to do with katerina .
do you have her in your possession ?
no .
i have better ,
i have her doppelganger .
that &apos;s impossible .
her family line ended with her .
i know that for a fact .
the facts are wrong .
well , show her to me .
elijah , you &apos;re a man of honor .
you &apos;re to be trusted ,
but i want to hear you say it again .
you have my word that i will pardon you .
follow me .
human .
it &apos;s impossible .
hello there .
house should be just beyond those trees .
wait . now , i &apos;ve got a little more experience
than you do with this sort of thing .
so what &apos;s your point ?
my point is whoever has elena is probably
who was after katherine in 1864 and before that .
and ?
and it puts them at 500 years old and strong .
are you sure you wanna do this ?
yeah , i &apos;m certain i wanna do it .
&apos;cause we go in that house , we might not come back out .
all right . then i won &apos;t come out .
so noble , stefan .
i can &apos;t think of a better reason to die .
but go on and stay here .
i &apos;ll totally understand .
well , we have a long journey ahead of us .
we should be going .
please , don &apos;t let him take me .
one last piece of business .
then we &apos;re done .
i &apos;ve waited so long for this day , elijah .
i &apos;m truly very sorry .
oh , no , your apology &apos;s not necessary .
yes . yes , it is .
you trusted me with katerina ...
and i failed you .
oh , yes , you are the guilty one ,
and rose aided you because she was loyal to you .
that , i honor .
where was your loyalty ?
i beg your forgiveness .
so granted .
you ...
don &apos;t , rose ...
now that you are free .
come .
no , what about the moonstone ?
what do you know about the moonstone ?
i know that you need it ,
and i know where it is .
yes .
i can help you get it .
tell me where it is .
it doesn &apos;t work that way .
are you negotiating with me ?
it &apos;s the first i &apos;ve heard of it .
what is this vervain doing around your neck ?
tell me where the moonstone is .
in the tomb underneath the church ruins .
what is it doing there ?
it &apos;s with katherine .
interesting .
what is that ?
i don &apos;t know .
who else is in this house ?
i don &apos;t know .
move !
rose .
i don &apos;t know who it is .
up here .
down here .
excuse me .
to whom it may concern ,
you &apos;re making a great mistake
if you think that you can beat me .
you can &apos;t .
you hear that ?
i repeat--
you cannot beat me .
so i want the girl
on the count of 3,
or heads will roll .
do we understand each other ?
i &apos;ll come with you .
just please don &apos;t hurt my friends .
they just wanted to help me out .
what game are you playing with me ?
just let her go .
hey , come here . are you hurt ? you ok ?
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
elena ? !
are you ok ?
i &apos;m ok .
i &apos;m ok .
i got your message .
where &apos;s elena ?
she &apos;s home .
and you &apos;re here why ?
because she wanted to be with jeremy .
here .
thanks .
listen , uh , what rose told elena about the curse ...
i know . we &apos;ll keep her safe .
you know the only way we &apos;re gonna be able to do that is
if we &apos;re not fighting each other .
we let katherine come between us .
we let that happen with elena ,
we &apos;re not gonna be able to protect her .
yes , stefan .
heard it all before .
damon .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry .
about what ?
for being the guy who made you turn 145 years ago .
enough , stef . it &apos;s late .
we don &apos;t need to rehash that .
you know what ? i &apos;ve never said it out loud .
i guess i just need to say it , and you need to hear it .
i &apos;m sorry .
what i did was selfish .
i didn &apos;t want to be alone .
guess i just needed my brother .
you know what ? this sounds crazy ,
but alcohol helps .
or at least it helps me .
you know , with all that inside jittery stuff .
i &apos;m hot .
it &apos;s like my skin is on fire .
really ?
i never had any of that .
guess wolves are different .
at the beginning , i was very , very emotional .
everything was heightened .
i have that .
how can you be a vampire ?
how can you be a werewolf ?
who else is like you ?
just me .
it &apos;s a really long story .
we can share another time .
uh , how many other werewolves are there ?
just me .
and my uncle mason ,
but he left town .
look , tyler ...
you can &apos;t tell anyone , ok ?
not about you , not about me .
no one will understand .
i know .
i want to tell you about my mom and yours
and the founding families and the council ,
but i need you to promise me no one will find out about us .
this is life and death , tyler .
i have no one else to tell .
i &apos;m sorry about earlier .
it &apos;s just-- i &apos;m alone with this .
it &apos;s gonna happen to me .
on the next full moon , i &apos;m gonna turn ,
and i won &apos;t be able to stop it .
i &apos;m scared .
tyler .
no , it &apos;s all right .
who &apos;s there ?
i &apos;m not here to hurt you .
why are you here ?
lexi once told me that you &apos;re one of the good ones .
you knew lexi ?
trevor was my best friend .
for 500 years , i have lived with one person ,
and he &apos;s gone .
and i don &apos;t wanna run anymore ,
because i don &apos;t have anybwhere else to run to .
well , i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t help you .
i don &apos;t need your help ,
but i think you need mine .
elijah may be dead , but this isn &apos;t over .
what do you mean it &apos;s not over ?
it isn &apos;t over .
the originals , they &apos;ll come for her .
they have to .
they &apos;re doing it for him .
for who ?
klaus .
cute pjs .
i &apos;m tired , damon .
brought you this .
i thought that was gone .
thank you .
please give it back .
i just have to say something .
why do you have to say it with my necklace ?
well ...
because what i &apos;m about to say is ...
probably the most selfish thing i &apos;ve ever said in my life .
damon , don &apos;t go there .
no . i just have to say it once .
you just need to hear it .
i love you , elena .
and it &apos;s because i love you that ...
i can &apos;t be selfish with you ...
why you can &apos;t know this .
i don &apos;t deserve you ...
but my brother does .
god , i wish you didn &apos;t have to forget this .
