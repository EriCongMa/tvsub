We cover up injuries...
with tape and gauze...
Have you seen Dr. Avery?
Upstairs in the lab.
...to protect the injury,
to prevent infection,
to save the patient from further suffering.
The hard part comes when you have to rip the bandage off...
...because that can hurt like hell.
How's it going?
Pretty good.
What's up?
Nothing. Have you talked to April?
No.
Why?
Nothing.
I just wanted to see how you guys were doing.
Have a good night.
She knows.
Knows?
April knows.
What?
Doesn't she?
Who told her, Karev?
I'm not sure h-- well, she told Karev.
Or he figured it out.
No, I mean, I-I told Karev.
I just asked him to keep it to himself.
What, keep it to himself? What are you talking about?
That I'm seeing people. That I'm dating.
That I went on a date.
So, April knows, huh?
That you're seeing other people.
Does April know?
No!
N-- She doesn't.
She doesn't know anything about that.
So then what are you talking about?
Nothing.
I w-- I was -- Nothing.
All this is just so weird and new.
I mean, I just really don't want April
to get her feelings hurt here, okay?
So just do me a favor.
Keep it to yourself. Be great.
April's pregnant.
April's pregnant.
Yeah.
Why are you telling me this?
Jackson, can we --
Why is she telling me this?
Did she happen to say where we were eating?
I think it's a steakhouse.
Yeah, unless you're not -- if you don't.
No, no. Fine.
Love a good T-bone.
Yeah.
Yes.
May-- Maybe we should call her.
Oh, it's Mag-- Dr. Pierce.
Have to cancel -- - called into big transplant.
Really sorry, but you two should still go.
Smiley face.
You know, truth be told, I'm a little tired.
Me too.
Rain check?
Rain check.
Okay.
Okay.
Good.
Okay.
So, what do you say?
Dr. Grey, would you like to go out with me?
I have said "No" to nicer faces.
Great, then this should be easy.
Yeah, it should.
Good, you're still here.
We've got a transplant on deck.
Karev was...
Sorry.
It's fine.
Hi. Will Thorpe.
You're Thorpe.
I mean, hello.
Maggie Pierce.
Tell Alex I'll be right there.
Okay. All right, I'll see you later.
Bye.
Or not.
Okay. All right. Bye.
So you've been talking about me.
That's not necessarily a good thing.
You haven't given me an answer.
Drinks.
Tomorrow.
Unless, of course, I change my mind.
When were you gonna tell me?
Now. Right now.
I was coming up to tell you now.
I'm supposed to believe that?
Yes! I can't believe that Arizona would say --
When did you know? How far along are you, April?
I'm 12 weeks.
12 weeks.
I was coming to tell you --
When did you know? Did you know before the divorce?
Did you know before we signed those papers?
April? I - - Yes. I...
Yes, I did.
I knew before.
Why? Why would you do --
I have to -- I have to go.
No, you don't.
I am being paged to the ER.
So give it to Grey or Hunt or literally anybody,
but you're not gonna walk away from this right now.
I can't.
I want to talk about this, Jackson.
I know we need to talk about this,
but now is not a good time.
Don't you walk away.
Okay?
I cannot talk about this right now.
You should get a dog. You seem like a dog guy.
I live in a trailer.
Yeah, that's something we can talk about.
You don't like my trailer?
No, sure, I also like grown-up houses.
Listen, I was thinking we could have dinner tomorrow?
It's my birthday, and I can't think of anyone else
I'd rather celebrate with, so...
Tomorrow's your birthday?
No, no. It's next week,
so you still have time to buy my gift,
but I was thinking we could, you know,
kick things off with dinner.
Do you like lobster?
Love lobster.
You know how to cook lobster?
Sure, you just boil a pot of water and --
Yeah, see. You're already losing me.
Crap. Incoming.
Tomorrow night, then.
Lobster.
Birthday lobster, which you are cooking.
That's become obvious.
We'll start with Kelsey's double lung transplant first,
and then, assuming the procedure goes well,
we'll go ahead and do the liver and pancreas.
And it has to be all at once?
Her CF has compromised her lungs, liver, and pancreas.
Replace any one of those organs now,
and the others are just gonna break down.
I know it seems overwhelming.
The surgery's long and extensive,
but this is our best shot.
I don't want to do it.
Sweetie, please.
Kelsey, you know how important this is.
I don't care. I don't want to do it.
I hear you. It's a bummer, though.
This donor is a perfect match -- one in a million.
You know, if we do this now,
you can make your Spring Formal.
Didn't you say what's his name ask you?
Sam? Or Steve? Or...
Parker.
Well, I guess Parker can find someone else.
I don't want to go if I can only sit and watch and be pitied.
What, are you kidding me? With these lungs?
They're gonna have to drag you off that dance floor.
Really?
Really.
So, Dr. Karev, how do we proceed?
What's the first step?
Is that the kid Alex paged us about?
Yep. Triple organ transplant.
Lungs, liver, pancreas -- the trifecta.
It's gonna be a long night.
I better text the sitter.
So, not that it's any of my business...
It's not.
He asked me out.
It's not a big deal.
So you said no?
You said yes?
Kind of.
Maybe.
It's drinks.
Good. You're free. You awake?
Yeah, I'm good.
This is good.
Can we not?
You're ready.
I thought I wasn't ready with DeLuca,
but now that it's out in the open, it's good.
What's good?
Thorpe, the military doctor.
He asked Mer out. She said yes.
She said yes to buy time.
She'll blow him off later. She'll cancel.
You didn't see this guy.
I don't have to.
I know Mer.
I know Mer, too.
I am Mer. Mer's right here.
I said yes. I'm going.
This is good.
Blake, activate the MTP.
We're gonna need blood, lots of it.
On it.
All right, patient's 10 minutes out, people.
Let's move.
April, I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.
I thought that I was --
I really don't give a crap what you thought.
Listen, I was with you before.
I lived through that with you, with Jackson,
and I just was trying to help somehow
so that maybe this time it could be different.
Sorry, you were there? You lived through that?
Um, no. No, Arizona.
That was me and that was Jackson.
We lived that nightmare, and I refuse to live it again.
And you know what? It is different this time,
because this time I am choosing to have faith
in a good outcome for this baby
until God himself tells me otherwise,
and Jackson ca-- Keps.
I will deal with this myself,
the way I want to, when I want to.
I know. I'm sorry, April. I thought --
Don't. Don't think about me.
Don't talk to me. Don't even look at me, okay?
And I believe in this stuff,
so understand how much I mean it
when I tell you go to hell.
What, you didn't tell him?
Come on. Keps, what were you thinking?
Shut up.
Well, of course he had a right to know.
Shut up. - I'm just saying --
Hey, I'm just saying he's justified.
All right? I'd be pissed, too.
I'd be really pissed.
28-year-old female,
fell over a hundred feet while rock climbing.
GCS 12, intubated, multiple extremity fractures.
Vitals are -- - Tess. Tess.
Her name is Tess.
You want to watch him, too. Mild signs of dehydration.
I'm okay. Just help Tess, please.
All right, Tess. We got you, okay?
You stay with us, all right? Stay with us.
Volumes and total lung capacity are perfect.
Replantation is technically easier on the right,
so we will do that side first.
Thank you for coming back in.
You really think I'd miss out on a triple organ transplant?
Oh, sorry.
Um, can you make sure that they have bypass on standby,
and, um, tell the blood bank to have six units on hold.
Okay.
Why aren't you at dinner?
We postponed. It was really weird.
It's not weird.
Dinner for two with Weber?
It's weird.
It's what you wanted. Out in the open.
If I'm gonna have dinner with your dad, you should be there, too.
I know. I'm sorry. I just got pulled into this.
You know, it's actually gonna be really cool.
Do you want to scrub in?
Yeah.
I've got Wilson and Cross scrubbing in now,
but I could switch things up.
No, no, no. See, don't do that.
We haven't even started yet.
If Cross is your intern, let him do it.
I'll -- I'll see you tomorrow.
No, no, no, no, no. I can get you both in there.
You can take turns holding retractors or something.
Don't you want to see this?
Why?
Got to wake up.
Just got called into a triple organ transplant.
Long night.
Callie?
I have a thing...
tomorrow night.
Uh, more, please.
Drinks with a guy.
You're getting back on the horse!
That's -- ooh, is it the, uh, is is the Thorpe horse?
Please tell me it's the Thorpe horse,
because that is a hot horse.
That is -- that is Secretariat.
No one's getting on a horse.
It is gonna be weird.
Well, at first it'll be a little weird,
but not bad weird, and, Mer, it's good.
Just getting back out there, it's...
it will be good.
Thanks.
If it's bad, it's still good, you know?
I mean, it's like trying to remember how to ice skate.
A couple minutes, you're like, "Whoa, oh, crap.
What -- What am I doing?"
But then -- then you remember how it works
and then it's like,
"Oh, yeah. Yeah, I can do this."
"Oh, I like this.
Ooh, ooh, I'm good at this.
It's skating time, my friend.
Push and glide. Push and glide.
You know"?
I'm more of a roller girl, myself.
She's hypoxic on 100%.
Okay, she's gonna need another tube on the right.
It's all right, Tess. I'm right here.
Blake, can you get that?
On it.
Sir, Michael, you need to leave the room.
We need room to work.
Don't worry, baby. I'm not gonna leave you, okay?
I love you. I love you. I love you so much.
BP's dropping.
What's happening?
Free fluid in the belly and she's still hypotensive
after multiple units of blood and plasma.
We got to get her up.
Blake, when you're done there,
we need to get her ready for transport.
No, no, no. I can't leave her.
Your daughter suffered severe injuries from the fall.
We're doing everything we can.
Is that her?
Oh, my God. Tess.
Another set of hands up in the OR?
I'll be right there.
I love you, Tess. I love you so much.
Michael. We told you.
We told you not to take her on that mountain.
Why are you always taking her on those damn mountains?
Uh, is there a place,
uh, where I can wait for her during surgery?
We all want to wait.
I'll take you all somewhere more private.
All right. None of us knew this was happening tonight,
and we're all tired, so let's be smart.
We have three organs from the donor
being transplanted into the recipient.
There'll be long stretches where not everyone is needed.
Take that time to nap, eat, hydrate.
Don't come into my OR at less than 100%.
Kelsey is prepped and ready.
All right.
Start time -- 23:58.
10 blade.
So we'll be up next, Cross.
Where's he taking you? Did he say?
Let it go.
You still haven't canceled that yet?
What part of "Let it go" is confusing? Lap pads.
I guess there's still time.
This is gonna be a very long night
if you two keep hounding me about this.
Wilson, don't you have anything to talk about?
Her engagement ring is still in the drawer in her bedside table.
Engagement...ring?
Steph, when was the last time you had sex?
All right.
If you're gonna ditch the guy, you better do it soon.
God, will you shut it?
You shut it.
Both of you shut it. Balfour.
And I have three children at home,
so don't think for a second
I don't know you two are making faces right now.
Settle in.
So, is there no directive in place?
Her fiance knows what she wants.
They spend their spare time dangling from cliffs.
Of course they talked about it.
But he doesn't have any rights, legally.
He's not her husband.
Just hoping to call it an early day
if we don't have to save this girl?
Guys. Malleable.
It'd be nice to know what the patient wants.
Well, we don't, so maybe we don't just give up yet.
I never said anything about giving up.
Guys, come on.
Right angle.
Here you go.
Another.
Where are we?
Should we scrub in?
We just started the first lung.
You're early.
Way early.
I'd say she still has a few more hours, right?
Plenty of time for you to go take a shower,
get a change of clothes, take a disco nap, groom.
Cancel plans that aren't gonna happen.
Or stay.
I mean, this is a triple organ transplant.
I wouldn't nap through this.
Exactly. I'm here. I might as well jump in.
Go on. Scoot.
You take some "Me" Time.
We will page you when you're up.
You are being ridiculous.
Okay, would you stop?
What?
She needs this. This is good.
I know that.
So stop being the harbinger of doom about it.
Stop being all "Whoo-yay" about it.
What are we talking about?
You just stop.
Alex, I have to be positive,
because if I'm not, you're gonna make her change her mind.
No, you are. Trust me.
If she feels trapped, she's gonna bolt.
Don't make a big deal out of this.
It's a big enough deal already.
I know it is.
You got to make her feel like she has an escape hatch
or she's gonna run for the hills.
Yeah, she will if you don't shut your dumb mouth.
You're dumb.
Go update Kelsey's parents.
We figure five hours for the lungs,
seven hours for the liver and the pancreas,
so there's time.
For?
Edwards, where do we keep the razor kits?
You know we have a shower, right?
Yeah. I'm on a clock.
This is an emergency leg shave.
It's not a big deal. It's just drinks.
What are you gonna wear?
Uh, sports bra and granny panties, apparently,
or whatever is in my locker from yesterday.
Why am I even doing this? This is just -- it's stupid.
You know, I brought a top with me today.
It's that one that you like.
It's the -- it's kind of see-through, and some heels.
Actually, they're your heels that I stole from you.
Sorry.
You stole my shoes?
The black ones you said
were too slutty for a mother of three.
Plus, they pinch a little,
but they are so worth it.
So worth it.
I'll leave everything out for you.
Thank you.
You didn't have to do that.
I know.
Hey, there you are.
Um, I got a message from Kayla's mom
about a sleepover with Sofia next week?
Sure. Yeah. It's fine with me.
Okay, great.
Is there something else?
No.
No.
You sure?
I, um...
I did something bad, I think...
when I was trying so hard to do something good.
I thought that I was --
I was being a good friend
and, I swear, I was.
I was -- I was right.
What was right?
April's pregnant.
And she refused to tell Jackson.
So...
So I did.
What?
And she's so angry with me right now.
Well...
I mean, I did the right thing, right?
No, honey. No.
But he's the other parent.
If April's keeping things from him...
Still. Still, no. ...- about the baby.
About the baby's future and the baby's health.
Doesn't matter.
Without him.
No, it still doesn't matter.
Yes, it does.
No, Arizona!
No. Just no.
Okay, so...
What if it had been us?
I mean, what if we'd been trying,
and then suddenly I was pregnant right
when we split up.
I mean, wouldn't you -- wouldn't you want to know that?
Well, yes. Yes, of course.
But from you.
Not from someone else.
I'm sorry. You screwed this one up big time.
W-Why aren't you down there?
I was on the procurement.
Why aren't you down there?
Don't you have an all-access or pass now?
Chief of cardio?
So smart.
But a guy who looks like you can get anyone.
There's no way I'm gonna land an attending.
A resident, maybe.
I mean, Wilson is like Ahhhhhh
But she's with Karev.
Blake likes ladies.
Edwards maybe,
she's hot and she's tight with Shepherd,
so that wouldn't hurt either.
Do you think I have a chance there?
No.
No.
Well, I got to hand it to you, dude.
You should go.
'Cause I'm about to nut punch you.
Small intestine and right colon excised.
Bring this to Path, please.
She's gonna need a TPN when she's more stable.
Dr. Kepner. Dr. Avery's wondering how long you'll be.
Tell him as long as I need to.
Everything all right?
I...
It's fine.
Medium clips.
April.
She said it was fine.
Pressure's dropping again.
Pupils are dilated. Non-responsive.
Crap.
Global ischemia from the hypotension?
Traumatic brain injury?
What difference does it make?
Her brain's been deprived of oxygen.
There's no coming back from this point.
Cabbage patch.
Damn it.
Blake, step in and finish creating the colostomy.
You comfortable with doing one?
Uh, yeah. Sure.
Then I'd like you to close up the fascia with running PDS.
Me? Okay. Why are you leaving?
'Cause there's nothing left to do.
Patient is too far gone.
But it's not every day you get to practice on living flesh,
so perfect your colostomy technique.
I'll call Shepherd for a neuro eval.
Man, she's not getting off that vent.
So wrong. It's not fair.
I'll let you know when Shepherd's done,
then we can go talk to Tess' family.
Robbins? You told Robbins and you didn't tell me?
I don't -- I don't have time for this right now, okay?
You've taken more than enough time, don't you think?
The time was before I signed the friggin' divorce papers.
What's going on there?
Jackson. I'm not doing this.
Not here. Not now.
Well, excuse me.
Is there a more convenient time for me to catch you lying to me?
Jackson!
You don't think a pregnancy
would have factored into my decision
to move forward with the divorce?
I knew it would, but you didn't want to stay with me.
You think I want you to stay for my baby...
Our baby.
and have you hating me for the rest of my life?
Well, you got a pretty good jump on that, didn't you?
Wow. That -- yeah. That didn't take any time at all.
All right. That's enough.
No, you know what? It's fine. Screw this.
You want to play the martyr here?
You want to pretend you're doing this alone?
Go for it.
Knock yourself out.
It's your deal, April. You win.
I'm out. I'm done.
I said enough.
What are you doing here? I told you I would page you.
There's still a ton of time before you need to be here.
I'm here. Let me help.
Fine. Jump in.
No. No. Not fine. No jumping.
Maggie, you got to let it go.
I can't let it go.
You told me your train had stopped running,
and tonight, one is coming into the station,
and that is a big deal.
I can't pretend like it's not.
Wilson.
Yes.
Go the attendings lounge, get my phone,
go into my contacts, find William Thorpe,
please text him and let him know
that tonight's plans have been canceled.
Meredith, no! Wait, Meredith --
My passcode is 1008.
Now it's really over. So let it go.
Pickups.
See what you did?
This is your fault.
Please, I just -- I-I just need a minute, okay?
Why didn't you tell me?
Because, um, I-I didn't want to tell anyone...
especially you.
I didn't want you to -- I feel like I'm just --
I'm screwing everything up,
and all I'm trying to do is protect this baby
and it's -- it's all screwed up.
Every-- everything is all screwed up.
April, April.
April, you're having a baby.
Yeah.
It's not screwed up.
It's...
It's a miracle.
Yes, it is.
Yes.
Thank you.
Bailey?
Can I ask you something?
You just did.
Well, um, I...
I did something, and I don't --
Yeah, I heard.
Oh. Well, great.
Yeah, you shared confidential medical information
without permission,
breaking multiple state and federal privacy laws.
You did it to a fellow doctor,
under this roof, in my hospital.
Speaking as your boss, that's a firing offense.
And speaking to me as my friend?
I mean, I can see where you thought
you were doing what was right.
Yes! Yes, I was.
That doesn't make it right.
Yeah, I-I-I'm fresh out of words of wisdom for you.
Okay.
I got all day.
I told you it's not your business.
Well, it is when you brawl on the O.R. Floor of my hospital.
I don't need your help!
Stop telling yourself that I need your help.
I don't. You're not my father.
I know I'm not.
But who is?
I don't see him around here, do you?
That the man you want to be?
You're having a child.
Maybe it's not the way you wanted.
Maybe it's not when.
All right, so you found out late.
I found out decades late.
What's important is now you know.
It's happening...
and you need to step up.
That's what matters.
Unfortunately, in surgery,
we discovered your daughter's injuries
were more catastrophic than we realized
and her brain function has virtually ceased.
Your daughter has virtually no brain activity.
I am so sorry.
Oh, my God.
But I saw her.
Her heart is pumping.
She's still breathing.
She's alive.
The ventilator is breathing for her.
She can't breathe on her own
or feed herself or use the bathroom.
She's using catheters and ostomies
and will likely need those indefinitely.
From this point on,
she will require round-the-clock professional care,
probably for the rest of her life.
Or until she gets better.
I'm sorry?
She'll need the care until she gets better,
until she wakes up - and she can leave the hospital.
Do we know when that might be?
When Tess could leave here?
Eventually, she would be moved
to a long-term acute care facility
where she would live for the rest of her --
Well, we can -- we can get you some brochures
if that's what you decide.
Or if you decide to withdraw care.
Oh, Tess.
I understand that this is difficult,
and you should take some time to talk this over.
That won't be necessary.
We understand the circumstances.
We want you to do everything that you can to save our daughter.
No! This is not what she'd want.
She could wake up.
I mean, people wake up from comas all the time.
Um, I'm sorry, but in Tess' case, that's highly unlikely.
She told me what she wants. More than once.
Please, she would not want to live like this.
What is wrong with you?
This isn't your decision to make, Michael.
If this had happened two months from now, it would be.
We would've been married.
Will you get him out of here?
Lines are out.
Almost done?
Anastomoses look terrific on both sides.
No bleeding or leaks.
Sats look great.
Yeah, nice work.
Well, uh, that does it for me,
unless you need me to stay and help... in any way.
I'll close. You can go.
Scalpel.
So, what's wrong with the guy?
Huh?
Thorpe.
What's his deal?
Nothing. He's fine.
Callie said he was a jerk that night at Bauer.
That's not true.
Said he almost killed the surgery.
Scissors.
10 blade.
He was just trying to protect his patient.
So he was throwing a tantrum like a toddler.
Shut up.
He's nice... and he's funny.
Mm, so he's just butt-ugly.
Yes. He is butt-ugly.
Yeah, well.
It's hard first time out after somebody important.
First girl after Izzie left? It was pretty messy.
You feel like you belong to somebody else,
like you're cheating, you know?
I mean, you're not, but man, sure feels that way.
I never had a wife die, but...
I've had a few "First time afters," Mer.
There's always something after... eventually.
We lose people and then we find new ones.
It's how it works.
I guess.
Oh, I know.
Look, if you're not into him, who cares?
But if you are, it's okay.
Okay?
Okay.
Plus, it's gonna be weird no matter what,
so you might as well get it over with.
Suction.
Yeah, she should be awake soon.
Looks like she's gonna make that big dance.
No more coughing and wheezing?
Well, the new organs don't carry the CF gene.
Once she's off the vent,
chances are good you'll never see her on one again.
Thank you.
She's gonna stay on that ventilator... forever?
Unless something changes, yes.
Her parents will hate me forever
for taking her up that mountain.
She'll hate me - for bringing her back down.
This place looks nice.
Lovely views.
And who knows?
She could be up and walking again this time next year.
You never know.
Don't give up hope, right?
God bless you, Dr. Riggs.
"Don't give up hope," Huh?
Well, that's all they have now, right?
You changed your tune. You wanted to give up all day.
No, I did not. I wanted to do what the patient wanted.
Oh, and you got to let this go.
Oh, what's that?
If you're still feeling guilty after all this time,
that's your deal.
Stop taking it out on me.
Guilty? What have I got to feel guilty about?
Oh, you think it's all my fault, but I never quit.
You did.
You let Megan go.
You stopped looking.
I didn't. I stayed behind.
I stayed. I looked. I searched, and I prayed.
Because you got her killed!
We don't know that. You decided it.
You made a decision that she was dead.
You came back here, you started over,
and you forgot about her.
You shut your mouth.
That's why you hate that I'm here,
'cause I remind you of what you did,
that you gave up on her.
I swear to God --
People here don't even know you had a sister.
That's sick, mate.
You need to hate someone?
Look in a mirror.
You had a tough day.
You heard, too?
I think everybody's heard by now.
Right.
I don't know what to do.
I want to make it right.
I mean, I have to make it right somehow,
but I don't know what to do.
I don't -- I don't know how to fix it.
You did something indefensible.
Right.
So maybe, um...
maybe I go to her again and apologize.
The only thing that you can do right now
is accept what you did was wrong.
And the only thing you can do to fix it is...
to wait.
Just give it time...
...and maybe April will forgive you.
Maybe she won't...
but you -- that is not up to you.
How's the, uh, how's the transplant going?
Huge success. Come on. I'll tell you all about it.
Actually, um, I think I'm gonna stay here tonight.
I got early rounds in the morning
and kind of want to just study.
Come over. I'll help you study.
I don't want help.
Okay.
I don't want special treatment,
and I don't want to miss out on things,
but that's already happening.
And I don't want to make awkward small talk with Dr. Webber.
You are the one - who wanted us to go public.
I know.
I know.
I'm just gonna study, all right?
Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Uh, I'm glad you called me back.
Well, I shouldn't have. I'm way too tired for drinks.
I just got out of a 17-hour surgery.
I probably shouldn't even drive home
until I've crashed here for a while, so...
So how about I take you home?
Um...you're skipping a bunch of steps, don't you think?
Yeah, how about I give you a ride home
so that you can crash in your own bed?
I don't mind.
Look, I know what 17 hours straight feels like.
I'm not worried about the drinks.
I'll take you out some other time.
Hey! Happy birthday!
Owen! Come on.
I'm holding a box of creepy, squirming lobsters.
You gonna let me in?
Just a sec.
Am I...early?
Uh, no, no, no, no, no. We're all good.
I was just gonna -- uh, come in.
Come on.
Looks like you already started the party.
No, no. - I might've screwed up a little.
I forgot that we were...
I'll just put these in the fridge, I guess.
Yes, I-I-I can put some water on.
It'll just take a minute to boil.
I...had a long day,
and Riggs is...
Riggs is what?
Nothing, it's just --
Don't listen to him.
Let's try this another time.
No, no, no. No.
No, let's do it.
No, let's not, Owen.
Amelia. - I'm just -- I'm gonna go.
It's fine. I'm fine.
Amelia, don't go. I'm sorry.
I just had a couple of beers.
Who is it?
It's me.
Hey, I-I just wanted to apologize.
I reacted badly today, and...
we're having a baby...
who does not deserve to have us arguing over it.
That's what I was trying to avoid.
I get that.
Sort of. I mean, - I'm -- I'm trying to get that.
We can figure this out.
All right?
Yeah.
Look, I just -- I honestly -- I didn't --
I waited to tell you because last time...
...last time tore us apart.
Literally.
Neither one of us could help the other
and everyone got hurt, and I just didn't want that...
for you or me.
I just -- I wanted to wait until I knew
that everything was okay,
and I'm -- I am -- I am really sorry.
Okay? I'm sorry.
You wanted to wait until it was too late?
Right? Until you were too far along to do anything about it.
I'm sorry. Do what, exactly?
I don't know -- - not put us through this again,
or a baby, for that matter.
I mean, I'd have to hold him while he dies.
Maybe have some options.
Um, that is not an option for me and you know that.
What about me?
What about my option --
You don't count here.
I don-- I'm the father.
Yes, you are. Yes.
You're the father when there's a baby.
But right now, you have no choice in this.
It's my body, my baby.
April.
You are not my husband.
You have no rights here.
It hurts to tear that bandage off.
We don't want to see what's underneath.
But maybe it's not the fear of the pain that holds us back.
I was worried about the duodenal segment getting ischemic.
Mm. Yeah, what'd you do?
Mm. I placed stents at the SMA
and the celiac anastomoses,
just to be on the safe side.
Smart.
Ketchup?
More ketchup?
I love my ketchup.
I did a portal reconstruction once --
good guy, had no idea he drank a fifth a day
until I tried to cut into his liver.
You know, it's shoe leather.
That makes it so hard.
Yeah.
Napkin.
I almost stopped drinking right then.
Almost.
Yeah.
I don't want to see my liver.
I don't want to see it, either.
Maybe we're really afraid
to see if the wound underneath is still open...
I should go up.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
You know what I did do that was funny?
I used an interposition aortic conduit
to supply the pancreatic graft.
Huh. How did -- How did you do that?
...or if it might actually be healing.
