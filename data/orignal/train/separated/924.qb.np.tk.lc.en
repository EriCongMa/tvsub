every kid who grew up in philly in the &apos; 80s
was obsessed with the sixers , especially my brother barry .
basketball was his life .
where &apos;s he gonna go ? is he gonna go left ?
is he gonna go right ? hook !
oh , and he passes to himself off the backboard .
ah ! didn &apos;t count .
didn &apos;t count .
he &apos;s on fire .
you &apos;re bruising the plums .
what do you think i &apos;m made of , fresh produce ?
it was his passion .
dr. j rejects him !
barry !
he was obsessed . it never stopped .
get that outta here !
he backs him down . he backs him down .
it was hard to live with .
you gotta get low !
you gotta want it . you can &apos;t come in here soft .
gotta pee !
move ! i drank a big gulp !
my brother had one dream-- going pro .
three ... two ... one !
at the buzzer !
there was more time left on the clock !
he was misinformed !
then he found a way to make his dream a reality .
mom , dad , i have huge news .
if you &apos;d follow me outside to the hoop ?
no .
here &apos;s good .
what if i told you one day
there &apos;d be a piece of technology
that can guarantee i play professional basketball ?
well , that day has come .
the reebok pump .
a cushion of air around the foot
that literally allows you to defy the laws of gravity .
and the amazing part ? it &apos;s only $ 175 .
don &apos;t say no .
no .
honey , i &apos;ve got a pair of reeboks upstairs you can have .
oh , really ?
can i please borrow your beige mom sneakers ?
listen ! my dream is to be a basketball superstar ,
not a nurse !
well , here &apos;s the thing about your dream--
it &apos;s stupid .
you have the money .
just get your pants and give it to me .
barry , your father &apos;s pants are not a bank .
money comes from hard work , you moron .
you really want those shoes ,
come down to the store and work for &apos; em .
fine !
but when i get to the nba ,
and you want my autograph ,
i &apos;m signing it , &quot; worst wishes ... barry . &quot;
it was october 5 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and while barry pursued his nba dream ,
i pursued a dream of my own--
seeing the movie &quot; poltergeist . &quot;
please , please . i &apos;ll do the dishes .
no ! you &apos;re not seeing that ghost movie .
it &apos;s too scary for you .
come on ! it &apos;s re @-@ released at the dollar theater .
a dollar ! you love a bargain .
forget it !
barbara fishman &apos;s neighbor &apos;s nephew saw that movie .
three days later , he had a terror stroke .
a terror stroke ?
that &apos;s not even a thing !
you can see this movie .
&quot; the great mouse detective &quot; ?
he &apos;s got a little magnifying glass .
ooh , take pops . he loves talking animals .
and here is a little extra money for something sweet .
now how about a little somethin &apos; sweet for me ?
mom , do we have to do this every morning ?
it &apos;s been four days since i &apos;ve gotten a huggie .
i &apos;m jonesin &apos; . i need my fix .
what are you doing ? what is this ?
you wanted a hug .
who hugs like that ? at least put some arm into it .
this is what i got .
go .
even though my mom was being denied
the affection she wanted ,
i wasn &apos;t about to be denied &quot; poltergeist . &quot;
thanks again for bringing me .
of course .
popcorn , milk duds , a mouse detective--
what &apos;s not to like ?
the mouse stuff comes at the end--
after the ghosts .
i felt awful for lying ,
but how scary could the movie really be ?
turns out , it was scary !
really scary !
really , really scary !
where the was the mouse ? !
okay , so you got your love seats over there ,
uh , sectionals over there .
that &apos;s a divan .
hey , vic , say hello to my son .
what ? little baby barry ?
get outta here !
that &apos;s a good @-@ looking kid there , mur .
he must get it from his mom !
where does vic jr. get it from , carl down at the loading dock ?
oh , man , come on !
that &apos;s part of the job . we bust balls .
yeah , vic . you sad old loser .
hey , what ?
you know what ? he &apos;s new . he &apos;s new .
let &apos;s just get to work .
all right .
so this is what we do all day ?
it &apos;s pretty cool .
no , no , no , no .
this is what i do all day , okay ?
you sweep .
and then you move some furniture ,
and you sweep around that .
i &apos;ll see you for lunch .
ah . i see what you &apos;re trying to do .
you &apos;re trying to break me .
well , you can &apos;t break me , old man .
i &apos;ll sweep your floor , and you know why ?
&apos;cause nobody gets to the nba without a struggle .
struggle away .
vic ? a little help here ?
hell , no .
sure , i knew &quot; poltergeist &quot; was just a movie ...
but when night came , it seemed pretty freakin &apos; real !
i just can &apos;t stop thinking about that movie .
it &apos;s really gone to my head , pops .
aw , buddy . it &apos;s all make @-@ believe .
it &apos;s not .
ghosts are real .
they &apos;re what keep the ghostbusters employed .
you got nothing to be afraid of .
now go get some rest .
okay . good night .
in my head , i knew pops was right ,
but the rest of me was not gonna take any chances .
desperate times called for desperate measures .
mom ? i have a tummy ache .
oh , sweetie . do you need to make ?
no ! but ...
can i sleep here tonight ?
yeah , sure .
i had given in .
for one night , my mom would get the snuggles
she so desperately craved .
and then morning came .
how &apos;s the tum @-@ tum ?
i @-@ it &apos;s fine . i &apos;m fine .
i gotta go .
see ya !
okay .
oh , adam , you forgot your jacket .
don &apos;t need it !
&quot; poltergeist &quot; ?
i told him not to see that movie . unbelievable !
he &apos;s scared .
that &apos;s why he wants snuggies .
hey , if you &apos;re looking for some snuggies , i--
you &apos;re not going to that party .
you never let me do ... anything !
that &apos;s when my mom realized
she had found the ticket to all the snuggies
she could ever want .
mom ?
you didn &apos;t put this clown here , did you ?
yes , adam .
after running errands , cooking dinner ,
and cleaning the house , i had lots of time
to futz around with a clown .
okay , okay . jeez .
mom ? i have a tummy ache !
little did i know the scariest thing in this house
was lying right next to me .
after a grueling week of manual labor ,
the day barry had been waiting for had arrived--
payday .
$ 33.27 ?
is this some sick joke ?
you &apos;re just busting balls , huh ?
this is a joke paycheck .
i wish i was busting balls .
welcome to the real world .
i know i made more than this . why is it so low ?
taxes !
you got federal , state , social security , f.i.c.a.
what are you talking about ? those aren &apos;t real things .
did you ever go to school ?
taxes ? those are totally real things .
just let me become a salesman .
i can make more if i work on commission .
you ? you &apos;re not ready .
there &apos;s a customer right there .
just let me go sell him the pink couch ?
it &apos;s a salmon love seat .
it &apos;s been there for five years .
it &apos;s un @-@ sellable .
i &apos;m gonna move him over to the sectionals .
you stay over here and continue your fine broom work .
sir , just so you know ,
we have financing .
bad credit , no credit ... no problem .
thanks . i &apos;m not gonna make any final decisions today , so ...
today is not a day for final decisions .
i &apos;m with you . take your time .
what are you doing ?
sorry . i had a phone call .
i didn &apos;t hear the phone ring .
oh , it rang . it was ron jaworski .
said he wants this couch .
ron jaworski ? the eagles quarterback ?
dude .
dude !
dude !
dude .
dude ?
dude . he literally just called .
i want this couch .
mm ... no can do .
ronnie j. just put this on reserve .
what if i pay cash ?
murray ?
you know what ? i &apos;ll handle big ron .
you , sir , have got yourself a deal .
thank you .
no doubt about it . barry was a natural .
meanwhile , i was still dealing with the supernatural .
mom ...
oh ! what &apos;s this about ?
tummy ache .
okay .
why don &apos;t you , uh , run upstairs ,
and i &apos;ll be there in a minute , okay ?
it &apos;s fine .
you scared me . that &apos;s not cool .
not cool , huh ? why &apos;d you take the remote outside ?
it &apos;s not what you think .
i think you &apos;re scaring adam so he &apos;ll give you hugs .
it might be what you think .
but is that so wrong ?
yes , it &apos;s wrong ! very , very wrong .
well , it would have never come to this
if i didn &apos;t have to beg for affection
from my own children .
here we go .
i used to walk through that door ,
and you would all come running and jump into my arms .
and then you stopped . and barry stopped .
adam &apos;s all i have left . and if he stops ,
no one &apos;s ever gonna hug me again .
you know i &apos;m gonna have to tell adam , right ?
don &apos;t !
just one more night of snugs , and i &apos;ll never do it again .
i promise .
i suppose i could forget the whole thing if ...
you let me stay out insanely late this weekend .
deal .
really ?
please . like you were gonna come home
when i wanted anyway ?
true .
i feel good about this .
my mother wasn &apos;t the only one feeling good .
over the next week , barry proved himself to be ...
not only a great salesman ,
but a real visionary .
mix the duck sauce with the hot mustard
and dip your egg roll in it .
that &apos;s crazy ! who does that ?
just do it . you &apos;ll like it , you big baby .
i don &apos;t like it .
i love it !
hey , barry , there &apos;s a woman on the phone
who said that you set aside two nightstands for her ?
yep . and set aside a one @-@ night stand for your wife .
wha--
just busting balls .
it &apos;s what we do .
come on . that &apos;s what we do .
i &apos;m home !
nobody bother me !
but my dad began to notice
that success was changing barry ,
and not all for the good .
that &apos;s the stuff .
what the hell are you doing ?
get out of my chair , go outside , play basketball .
or something .
ah , screw basketball .
it was a stupid dream . you were right .
but furniture ? that &apos;s where it &apos;s at .
oh , look at you !
you &apos;re a mini murray !
chip off the old block .
he really was ,
and my dad suddenly realized he didn &apos;t like it one bit .
so he decided to handle it the only way he knew how .
you &apos;re fired .
what ? why ?
it &apos;s not working out .
yes , it is . it &apos;s working out awesome .
you just can &apos;t randomly fire me .
i mean , you have to have cause .
okay . it &apos;s &apos; cause you &apos;re a moron .
no . this is not happening .
in fact , i fire you . that &apos;s right , you &apos;re fired .
y @-@ you don &apos;t have to go .
no . no , no , no .
you guys leave and come to my store instead .
he doesn &apos;t have a store .
oh , yes , i do have a store .
i &apos;m opening one right across the street .
he &apos;s not opening across the street .
i just did !
no , you didn &apos;t .
and ron jaworski &apos;s really gonna go there ...
you don &apos;t know ron jaworski .
and people are gonna treat each other nicely .
it &apos;s gonna be a friendly working environment !
who &apos;s coming with me , huh ?
you ! vic ,
i &apos;m doubling your salary . you work for me now .
wait , for real ?
for real , for real .
no , he &apos;s not going with you .
toodle @-@ oo !
his store sounds nice .
his store isn &apos;t real !
my dad was hoping
by the time he got home from work ,
the barry incident would have blown over .
but in our house , things just blowup .
you fired your own son ?
oh , boy .
damn right he fired me .
and you know why ? &apos; cause he &apos;s jealous .
that &apos;s right . i sold the pink couch .
and for a brief moment ,
you got to see what a good furniture salesman looks like .
this . yeah . soak it in .
okay . we &apos;re done yelling . let &apos;s all just calm down .
oh , i &apos;m done .
i &apos;m done with you , i &apos;m done with the store ,
and i &apos;m done with furniture ... forever !
what does that even mean ?
i reject all furniture !
i &apos;m going up to my room and getting rid of everything .
i &apos;ll never be comfortable again .
what are you doing ?
rejecting all furniture .
what are you doing ?
there &apos;s a ghost in the tv .
that &apos;s just stupid .
thanks for sleeping over , pops .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t come sooner , kiddo .
no man should have to
bunk up with his mom for a week .
no man .
but what happens when you leave ?
you can &apos;t protect me forever .
but this watch sure can .
my grandpa irv gave me this
just before i shipped off to france ,
and he told me as long as i kept it with me ,
nothing bad would happen , and he was right .
thanks . i feel better already .
what the hell is that ?
it came from inside the trunk .
evil !
beverly , what are you doing ?
it keeps coming back !
there &apos;s gotta be a rational explanation for this .
of course there is !
my toy chest is a portal to hell !
aha ! that &apos;s the explanation !
m @-@ my walkie @-@ talkie ?
you !
what &apos;s the matter , pooh ?
don &apos;t you &quot; pooh &quot; me .
don &apos;t you &quot; pooh &quot; him .
there is a monster in this house , and it &apos;s you .
you &apos;re the monster .
if that &apos;s what you really think of me ,
then i have failed as a mother .
well , you lied , too .
i told you not to see that movie ,
and you did it anyway .
and you shouldn &apos;t have let him see something so scary .
not my fault .
that movie was wildly mis @-@ titled .
there was neither a mouse nor a detective .
i hope you enjoyed the hugs while they lasted ,
&apos;cause i got news for you , woman .
as of this moment , i &apos;ll never snug you again .
ever !
after a week of being scared by my own mother ,
what i just said terrified her to the core .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m losing sleep
over that damn kid .
adam &apos;s never forgiving me ,
but you could still patch things up with barry .
just hire him back .
i can &apos;t !
the last thing i want is that kid peddling furniture
for the rest of his life .
i want more for him .
why didn &apos;t you tell him that ?
eh , he ... he knows .
murray .
fine !
fine .
we &apos;re bad parents , aren &apos;t we ?
we &apos;re not great , that &apos;s for sure .
but who really is ?
well ...
ah . the blond people down the block .
the ones with all the bikes .
they &apos;re making it work .
oh . at least we have each other .
yeah , you can &apos;t scare me away .
here .
i know you love bill murray
and you wanted to see &quot; stripes &quot;
and i wouldn &apos;t let you .
um ... it &apos;s playing at the dollar theater .
not interested .
i hear they show boobs .
how many ?
i &apos;m sorry i scared you .
but you were so warm and snuggy , and ...
i miss it .
i just need a hug , and when i don &apos;t get it ,
i do bad things .
fine .
one hug ... a week .
one a day , monday through friday , weekends off .
every other day , two seconds max .
five seconds .
three and a half seconds . that &apos;s my final offer .
deal .
that one &apos;s free .
what ?
go away . not talking to you .
that &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll do the talking .
why ? did mom send you here ?
of course she did .
all right . uh ... when i was your age ,
my dad-- he wasn &apos;t around much .
i had nobody looking out for me .
so i had no direction .
boy , if i hadn &apos;t met your mother ,
i don &apos;t know where i &apos;d be today .
and then pops gave me a job at the store ,
and , uh , suddenly i &apos;m a guy
with a family and a future .
what i &apos;m trying to say is
for me , selling furniture was--was a big deal .
but i want more for you .
no .
no ... way .
the reebok pumps ? for real ?
i thought you said my dream was stupid .
yeah , well , you &apos;re just the moron to pull it off .
oh , my goodness !
thank god he can sell furniture .
welcome to my house .
ain &apos;t no one gonna stop barry .
swish , baby !
swish , baby !
lefty . lefty .
swish , baby !
