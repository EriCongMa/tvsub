第六季 第三集
no , that &apos;s not what he said .
no , it &apos;s not .
because it isn &apos;t .
no , i ...
look ...
no . listen , i have to go .
you can sit .
mr. agos ... a @-@ gos ?
agos .
agos .
mr. agos , i am your pretrial service officer ,
joy grubick .
you &apos;ve been released on bond awaiting trial
and your release has come with certain conditions .
my job is to see to it that you live up to those conditions
and to report to the court on your compliance .
do you understand ?
i do .
in my supervisory capacity ,
i will regularly meet with you , your lawyer , your employer ,
and other collateral witnesses to ascertain your fitness
for continued bond release . hmm ?
you are currently employed ?
i am .
i @-@ i don &apos;t see any entry
for direct supervisory employer here .
yeah , i don &apos;t really have an employer .
i &apos;m a partner at my law firm .
i need a name .
alicia florrick . my other partner .
you need any information on drug or alcohol treatment programs
while subject to release ?
no .
have you used any controlled substances
since your release ?
no .
have you partaken of any alcoholic beverages ?
mm , no ... a beer .
one beer ?
yes .
and ...
when did you consume this beer ?
uh , after my release .
there was a celebration with a few coworkers .
mm ... was this at a bar ?
no , at my apartment .
you said this was a celebration with a few people .
and who were they ?
you want to know their names ?
yes .
actually , it was probably just one .
i need a name .
kalinda . sharma .
let me see your hand .
although you are not explicitly forbidden alcohol ,
we would advise against any triggers for abuse .
i understand .
how are you handling your release , mr. agos ?
how am i handling it ?
fine , i guess . i wasn &apos;t in that long .
any disagreements at work ?
we need more space . i can &apos;t bring my clients here .
we &apos;re already overextended . we can &apos;t just ...
all right , everyone stop .
no , everything went well .
well , how &apos;s your employer handling your return ?
alicia ?
that is the heart and soul of lockhart / gardner .
we took their six top department heads .
why are you screwing this u ...
she handled it very well .
a condition of your bail is that you
inform your clients of your current status .
have you done so , either by letter or in person ?
yes , in person .
and what did you say ?
two weeks ago i was arrested for transporting
$ 1.3 million in heroin .
um ... obviously , i didn &apos;t do it .
in fact , we think that the state &apos;s attorney brought these charges
because cary is such an effective advocate .
i still plan to be involved with all my cases ,
but we also have other attorneys who are willing to step in
we don &apos;t want any interruption in your service .
we want to keep you as a client .
so what do you think , mr. clay ?
and did you lose any clients after informing them of your status ?
yeah , a few .
how many ?
four .
and who have you retained ?
cary ,
i had some issues in my youth .
stole a car .
went for a joyride , crashed into some barbed wire .
i was in jail for four months .
that &apos;s where i turned my life around .
forgiveness isn &apos;t just a nicety to me ,
it &apos;s my life .
so , yes , i want you to stay on my case .
thank you . thank you , ed .
dean ?
mr. pratt .
dean levine @-@ wilkins . good to meet you .
nice to meet you .
dean and i will argue in court ,
but purely under cary &apos;s supervision .
good .
yes , i know you have to get back to court .
mr. agos , let me give you some advice .
i do this because i care .
i know it doesn &apos;t sound like it ,
but that &apos;s just the way i talk .
you can &apos;t live life the way you used to .
you can &apos;t just have a beer .
you can &apos;t just associate with your old friends .
you need to treat this seriously
or you will end up behind bars again .
you understand ?
i think i do .
good .
see you next week .
what is this , mr. pratt ?
it &apos;s a seed .
a seed .
a seed with a genetic protective shell ?
yes . our scientists call it a full metal jacket .
a full metal jacket .
objection . we all heard , including his honor .
again , the defense attorney is abusing his objections .
you &apos;re objecting to my objections ?
you know what you &apos;re doing ...
stop it , everybody stop !
the objection is overruled .
let &apos;s go , mr. schmidt .
i mean , mr .... you .
thank you , your honor .
mr. pratt , you &apos;re a farmer yourself , aren &apos;t you ?
i am . my dad , too . four generations .
and that &apos;s why you started the company ?
yes . we wanted to create a seed
that could genetically withstand whatever nature threw at it .
okay , so how much did it cost to develop this seed ?
this seed here ?
$ 400 million .
$ 400 million .
well , then why are you suing mr. keller ?
he &apos;s a farmer just like yourself , isn &apos;t he ?
patent infringement .
we received a tip he was brown @-@ bagging .
i &apos;m sorry-- brown @-@ bagging ?
uh , saving and replanting seeds from his harvest .
okay , the supreme court held in j.e.m. ag supply v. pioneer
that saving patented seeds is illegal ?
it &apos;s my own seed .
on my own land .
your honor .
he &apos;s simply stating the obvious .
he can state the obvious when you &apos;re questioning him ...
mr. levine @-@ wilkins has yet to even establish ...
shut up !
we &apos;re taking a five @-@ minute recess .
alicia , watch it with ed .
i don &apos;t think he likes all the fighting .
it &apos;s just bluster .
i know that , but he doesn &apos;t .
mr. pratt , do you have a monopoly on seed distribution
in kane county , illinois ?
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;d call it a monopoly .
my seeds are very popular .
isn &apos;t my client the only farmer in kane
who doesn &apos;t use your seeds ?
yes , i think that &apos;s right .
and that makes him a target ?
objection , your honor . argumentative .
sustained . move on , mr. schmidt .
thank you . i have here a chart
from the national weather service .
can you tell me what it shows ?
wind speed and wind direction .
good . now , every farm surrounding mr. keller &apos;s land
uses your seeds ,
so isn &apos;t it possible that these high winds
blew your patented seeds onto my client &apos;s field ?
objection . calls for speculation .
if mr. schmidt wants to question a meteorologist ,
then bring in a meteorologist .
sustained . move on , mr. schmidt .
i have some good news .
and some bad news ?
no , just ... good news .
you &apos;re so tense .
the state &apos;s attorney lost its witness against you .
what ?
the confidential informant on bishop &apos;s crew--
the one wearing the wire .
he was the cornerstone of the case .
and they lost him .
how did they lose him ?
i have no idea .
he just went missing .
he was scared of testifying .
but without him , the state &apos;s attorney has no case .
it &apos;s not over yet .
the asa is asking for a continuance at 2 : 00 .
but i @-@ i do think the judge will dismiss .
so don &apos;t lose hope .
did bishop get to him ?
the c.i.-- did bishop get to him ?
oh , i don &apos;t think he knew about him .
anyway , i &apos;ve got to go .
i &apos;ll see you at 2 : 00 .
thank you , diane .
you said they had a c.i. with a wire .
yeah .
i think that &apos;s gonna take care of itself .
it &apos;s because you know you have no case .
i see you &apos;ve forgotten the rules of questioning !
you three get so excited about winning arguments ,
you forget the point !
mrs. florrick .
thank you , your honor .
mrs. toms , is that man over there a customer
at your feed and seed store ?
yes , ma &apos;am . he bought our non @-@ gmo seeds .
he wasn &apos;t anti @-@ gmo or anything , just ...
he said he didn &apos;t want to pay big prices .
and did he stop buying these seeds in 2012 ?
yeah . he told my husband ...
objection , your honor . hearsay .
804 exception , your honor .
declarant is unavailable .
mrs. toms &apos; husband is deceased .
that doesn &apos;t make any difference .
wait . wait .
mrs. toms , did mr. keller ever discuss with you directly
why he stopped buying seeds ?
no .
then i sustain the objection .
your honor , this is ridiculous .
what &apos;s ridiculous is mrs. florrick
not being able to accept a loss ...
hey ! shut up !
did you call ?
my wife did . she has time .
good .
we &apos;re gonna have to tell them . the lawyers ?
it &apos;s just better to give them a foregone conclusion .
what foregone conclusion ?
cary ... this isn &apos;t working for us .
what isn &apos;t ?
the trial .
sir , you should be talking to your own lawyer .
that &apos;s the problem .
it &apos;s about the lawyers , not us .
wendell is my neighbor .
i have a disagreement with him ,
not with you all .
my wife just called an arbitrator .
he can start with us immediately .
well , ed , arbitration is exactly like court .
just as binding , just as ...
this is different .
welcome to binding christian arbitration .
my name is del paul .
mr. pratt and mr. keller have requested this forum
because they believe there is a better way
than the adversarial approach of blame and denial .
it &apos;s called the matthew process .
and yes , lawyers , that is a real thing .
jesus tells us : if your brother sins ,
go and point out his fault , just between the two of you .
and if he doesn &apos;t listen , take one or two others along
so that every matter may be established
by the testimony of two or three witnesses .
so , why don &apos;t we begin ?
let us pray .
lord , we thank you for this day ,
and we thank you for these professionals
who just want to see justice done .
mr. pratt , do you have a monopoly on seed distribution
in kane county , illinois ?
well , i don &apos;t know if i &apos;d call it a monopoly .
my seeds are very popular .
isn &apos;t my client the only farmer
in kane who doesn &apos;t use your seeds ?
yes , i think that &apos;s right .
and that makes him a target ?
objection . argumentative . come on .
go ahead , you can answer .
uh , sorry , sir , but the question was inflammatory .
no . i think he can handle it . go ahead .
wendell is only a target in the sense that
if people take my seed without paying ,
i would go out of business .
i have here a chart from the national weather service .
can you tell me what it shows ?
wind speed , wind direction .
isn &apos;t it possible
these high winds blew your patented seed onto my client &apos;s field ?
objection . calls for speculation .
if you want to question a meteorologist , mr. schmidt , do so .
del .
i &apos;m feeling a little attacked here .
look , every answer will only get us closer to the truth .
so , let &apos;s just answer honestly .
okay , your honor ... uh , del ,
that is an improper question .
it seems proper to me .
not for a layman , or a non @-@ meteorologist .
but mr. pratt must have an opinion . we all do .
so , let &apos;s just hear his .
well , sure , it &apos;s possible .
it &apos;s possible high winds blew your seed onto my client &apos;s land ?
sure .
well , if that &apos;s true ,
isn &apos;t it possible this seed on his land is just ...
part of god &apos;s plan ?
without their confidential informant , your honor ,
the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office has no case .
we have a recording of the defendant perpetrating this crime .
allegedly perpetrating .
and my client has a sixth amendment right
to confront his accuser .
which presupposes that trey wagner is our only witness .
is he ?
no .
ah , here &apos;s the accused now .
come join us in the lovely bond court .
my apologies , your honor . i was in court on another matter .
the fact that the asa has requested a delay in preliminary
suggests that he has no evidence
other than this one witness .
i &apos;m afraid that ms. lockhart has been misinformed about our motion .
we &apos;re not asking for a delay in preliminary .
we &apos;re asking for revocation of bail .
your honor , this is ... what has mr. agos
ever done to warrant revocation of bail ?
the day that mr. agos was released from holding ,
the primary witness against him , trey wagner , disappeared .
that is completely irrelevant .
we have evidence mr. agos intimidated the witness .
what evidence ?
a report from his pretrial services officer
that he met with kalinda sharma after his release .
kalinda sharma then approached trey wagner .
your honor , this is attack by supposition .
which is why we need a revocation of bail hearing .
mr. agos has already
been through a source of funds hearing .
now the county wants a revocation of bail hearing ?
this is ... this is kafka in action .
the longer i live , the more i realize
that everything is kafka in action .
i will hear arguments on tuesday .
thank you , your honor .
next .
they &apos;re gonna get me one way or another .
well , that &apos;s not what he said .
no , it isn &apos;t .
no , no , that &apos;s not what he said .
no , he didn &apos;t say that .
uh ... no . look , i have to go . good @-@ bye .
hi . my name is joy grubick ,
and i &apos;m the pretrial service officer for cary agos .
and as such , it is my job to write a report to the court
on cary &apos;s compliances with , uh , his bond obligations .
looks like you already did that .
i &apos;m sorry ?
you already did that .
the court is holding a revocation of bail hearing
based on your report .
no , no , no .
that was based on my notes .
ah . well , that &apos;s a comfort .
you &apos;re mr. agos &apos; employer ?
no , i &apos;m his partner .
well , yes , but , for my report , i need to declare an employer .
well , that &apos;s too bad , because he doesn &apos;t have an employer .
okay .
and how has cary been doing at work , mrs . florrick ?
we took their six top department heads .
why are you fighting me on this ?
because this is b.s.
they are not ours !
they want to change ...
well . he &apos;s doing well .
good .
i understand he was in court yesterday and today .
yesterday , but not today .
and afterwards , after court ?
alicia , do you have a minute ?
what &apos;s up ?
we heard you were staffing your campaign office .
you ... no . where did you hear that ?
a reporter called me for comment .
she asked if i had a position on your campaign .
i didn &apos;t even know there was a campaign to have an opinion about .
yes ?
you want to hear what happened afterwards , right ?
yes , after court .
the state &apos;s attorney met with me .
i see . was cary agos with you ?
no . mr. castro just came to see me .
well , then it &apos;s not important . we can move on .
you don &apos;t want to hear about mr. castro threatening cary ?
i &apos;m not threatening cary .
it sounds like you did .
no .
i &apos;m saying , cary &apos;s case will go away
if he testifies against bishop .
that &apos;s what we call plea bargaining .
mr. castro , you don &apos;t come to cary , who &apos;s in the next room .
you don &apos;t come to his lawyer , diane lockhart . you come to me .
who are you really threatening here ?
i really don &apos;t need to hear all this .
you don &apos;t want to hear about
the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s threats ?
they &apos;re not relevant to my report .
but i &apos;m not finished yet .
are you asking whether this has anything to do with your campaign ?
let &apos;s just be clear , mr. castro .
you &apos;re making a connection between cary agos &apos; prosecution
and your campaign for state &apos;s attorney .
no . i &apos;m doing the opposite .
i &apos;m saying cary &apos;s prosecution has nothing to do with politics .
but ...
here we go .
well , it won &apos;t look good for your campaign , will it ?
your partner being in prison .
you want to repeat that , mr. castro ?
no ... but ...
i will say this .
it &apos;s a bad idea to run , alicia .
very few saints survive oppo research .
i &apos;m not running .
i &apos;m gonna stop you right there .
you don &apos;t want to hear more ?
no , it &apos;s just that that &apos;s all the time we have .
but thank you .
and good luck .
with ?
with your campaign .
i heard about it on the drive in .
it was on morning edition .
eli , what ... ?
i know . i heard the morning edition thing , too .
i had nothing to do with it .
they said i opened a campaign office .
no , they quoted a blog saying you opened a campaign office .
but you haven &apos;t , so the quote is wrong .
mr. gold , mrs. florrick is here to see you .
thank you , nora . your precognitive powers amaze me .
tell them it &apos;s wrong .
what ?
tell them i &apos;m not running .
no . you just feed the fire if you tell them things .
no . i feed the fire . you feed them on background .
okay , talk to steve inskeep at the fund @-@ raiser tomorrow .
what ? no . who ?
from morning edition .
he &apos;ll be at the fund @-@ raiser tomorrow night . did you forget ?
no . when ?
7 : 00 p.m. talk to him .
it &apos;s the only way to nip this in the bud .
i have to get to church .
good . atheism doesn &apos;t play anyway .
congratulations ,
ms. state &apos;s attorney .
actually , no , it &apos;s all wrong . i &apos;m not running .
really ? did you hear morning edition ?
they got it wrong . i &apos;m not running .
cary , do you have a second ?
how was your p.s.o. interview ?
good . or i don &apos;t know . i had a bit of an edge .
but i &apos;m not so sure that &apos;s a bad thing .
well , thank you , and i &apos;ve been thinking .
this @-@ this rule change in arbitration
isn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing , either .
what are you thinking ?
mrs. toms , is that man over there a customer at your seed store ?
he is . wendell bought our non @-@ gmo seeds .
he wasn &apos;t anti @-@ gmo or anything . just ...
gmo ? uh , what &apos;s that ?
genetically @-@ modified organism .
wendell said he just didn &apos;t want to pay big prices .
good .
and did he stop buying seeds at your store in 2012 ?
yeah . he told my husband that he ...
objection , your honor .
del . hearsay .
and , uh , rule 804 does not apply here .
mrs. toms is a widow ,
and a christian woman who has something to share , so ...
isn &apos;t that right , mrs. toms ?
so , shouldn &apos;t she be allowed to speak honestly and forthrightly ?
well , first of all , you don &apos;t need to gild the lily .
second of all , she hasn &apos;t said anything yet .
yes , but , del ,
i know what she will say .
she has no firsthand knowledge of the events
she &apos;s being asked to give testimony for .
mrs. toms , have you been telling the truth here today ?
i have .
then you may answer the question .
del ?
mr. schmidt ,
i know this may seem foreign to you ,
but you have to trust the process .
mrs. toms , what did your departed husband tell you ?
that wendell said he didn &apos;t need to buy seed from us anymore
because he &quot; hit the mother lode . &quot;
and by &quot; hitting the mother lode , &quot;
you believe that mr. keller was taking and planting mr. pratt &apos;s seeds ?
yeah . why else would he not need our seed anymore ?
uh , can i break in here ?
why don &apos;t we ask him ?
what ?
why don &apos;t we ask wendell ?
he &apos;s sitting right here . i &apos;m staring right at him .
why don &apos;t we just ask him ?
your honor ...
del , he hasn &apos;t been sworn in .
yes , but we &apos;ve been trusting mrs. toms .
why don &apos;t we just trust wendell ?
mr. keller ,
have you been planting these seeds of mr. pratt &apos;s ?
del , i &apos;m going to instruct my client not to answer .
no . guys ... see ...
that &apos;s not how this works-- the matthew process .
just answer the question , just tell the truth .
do i replant seed ? sure .
always have , always will .
ed &apos;s seeds ? i don &apos;t know .
is it possible some of ed &apos;s seed got onto my land
and i replanted them ? sure .
okay , well , uh , del ,
i congratulate our defendant on his honesty ,
but that &apos;s our whole suit .
he admitted his complicity .
no .
did you intend to plant these seeds , wendell ?
it doesn &apos;t matter if he intended to .
intent is irrelevant to patent law .
he just admitted ...
but intent is relevant here .
1 samuel 16 : 7 .
&quot; god sees not as man sees ,
for man looks at the outward appearance ;
but god looks at the heart &quot; &quot;
come on . he just admitted to breaking the law .
no , he admitted to not being conscious of breaking the law .
grace ?
do you have a minute ?
yeah .
&quot; my conscience is clear , but that does not make me innocent .
it is the lord who judges me . &quot;
so ... doesn &apos;t that mean ...
that you can sin and not even know it ?
i guess .
so intent is irrelevant to guilt .
yeah , but that &apos;s only one verse .
yeah , but that &apos;s all i need . i &apos;m just looking for a precedent .
that &apos;s called prooftexting , mom . you can &apos;t do that .
you have to look at what the whole bible says .
but aren &apos;t all the verses considered true ?
well , yeah , but you can &apos;t pick and choose .
i &apos;m a lawyer . that &apos;s what i do .
so you really believe all this , grace ?
the tower of babel ? noah &apos;s ark ? everything ?
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s all historically accurate .
but ...
i think it can be true in another way .
what other way ?
well , you know , like poetry .
it can still be true even if it &apos;s not accurate .
look ,
if i wanted you to remember that god created everything ,
i &apos;d probably tell you a story about it happening in seven days .
like , that doesn &apos;t actually mean that it happened in seven days .
it just means that i wanted you to remember
that god created everything .
did you just ... make all that up ?
yeah , why ?
well , it sounds ... smart .
well , thanks for being surprised .
oh , my gosh .
okay . so i can use the first quote .
what is it ?
1 corinthians .
and he &apos;ll come back at me with 1 samuel 16 : 7 .
what can i use ?
romans .
&quot; i would not have known what sin was
had it not been for the law &quot; &quot;
right , good . the law . yeah .
oh , and look at his translation .
um , i think it &apos;s american standard version .
compare it to , uh , the revised standard .
&quot; if a person sins and does something
the lord has commanded not to do ,
even if he doesn &apos;t know it , he is still guilty .
he is responsible for his sin &quot; &quot;
leviticus ?
chapter 5 , verse 17 .
i think it &apos;s pretty clear , del .
intent is not essential to sin .
do you know what the penalty for that was , alicia ,
in leviticus 5 ?
the burnt offering of a male sheep .
are you suggesting mr. keller burn a sheep ?
&apos;cause we could arrange that .
i see you &apos;ve both done your homework .
del , i would argue that new testament commands hold sway
over old testament commands , just as christ came to fulfill the law .
not to abolish it .
yeah , that &apos;s matthew 5 : 17 .
1 corinthians 4 : &quot; my conscience is clear ,
but that does not make me innocent . &quot;
thank you . it &apos;s good to see you &apos;ve all
become biblical scholars overnight .
but i would agree .
i may have been a little hasty yesterday .
clearly the scriptures are not as easy to unpack as i would like .
i &apos;d like to reflect on this ,
pray on it ,
and i &apos;ll return with my decision .
detective prima , what are we ... what are we looking at here ?
that &apos;s trey wagner , our confidential informant
in lemond bishop &apos;s gang .
your former confidential informant ?
yes , unfortunately , yes .
and these photos were taken ...
a week ago .
the same night that mr. agos was released .
here is another photo of trey . and who is he with ?
that &apos;s kalinda sharma , an investigator working for mr. agos &apos; firm .
look forward . no emotion .
and what happened after this photograph was taken , detective ?
trey wagner disappeared . we have reason to believe
that ms. sharma passed along a message from mr. agos ...
objection . rank speculation .
sustained .
so trey wagner was a witness against mr. agos ?
that &apos;s right .
tell me , do you know , was it a condition of his bail that
he not contact any of the witnesses ?
it was .
thank you , detective .
mrs. wagner , your husband is a confidential informant
for the chicago police department , is that correct ?
i &apos;ve been told that now . i didn &apos;t know before .
and when is the last time that you saw your husband , mrs. wagner ?
seven days ago . july 1 .
can you describe the last time you saw him ?
he came home around midnight .
he was scared .
he said someone was gonna kill him .
and how did he know that ?
some indian woman told him .
don &apos;t turn around . don &apos;t do anything .
thank you , mrs. wagner . your honor ,
kalinda sharma met cary agos the night
that he was released from holding .
20 minutes after that , trey wagner was warned by an indian woman ,
that he should be afraid for his life .
kalinda ...
i can &apos;t suborn perjury ,
so i &apos;m not gonna ask what you did or who you met with ...
i think that &apos;s smart .
but i think it would be good if there were a way
to impeach stacie wagner &apos;s testimony .
i agree .
i &apos;m not worried about suborning perjury .
did you threaten trey wagner ?
no .
you told bishop he was the c.i. ?
you don &apos;t want to know , cary .
and then you warned trey that bishop was coming after him ,
and that &apos;s why he took off .
i have to go .
i didn &apos;t know you were religious .
i almost became a priest .
really ? when ?
right out of high school .
why didn &apos;t you ?
to kill a mockingbird .
yeah . that book created a lot of lawyers .
yeah , i realized i wanted justice in this world , not the next .
you ?
i don &apos;t know what i want .
mrs. florrick , hello .
my name is joss acker .
hi , i &apos;m frank seddio .
before you completely staff up your campaign office ,
i &apos;m a member of the black caucus ...
i think we met last year . i was in the audience at your speech .
actually , actually , gentlemen , i &apos;m not running ,
and i have a reception to get to ,
so ...
african @-@ americans have been completely ignored
in campaign staffing for years now , mrs. florrick ...
the governor said you would say that .
and i really want you to know ...
wait . what ?
diversity hires , ma &apos;am .
no , what did you say about the governor ?
my husband ?
yes , he sent me to see you .
he ...
wait , mrs. florrick , please ... mrs. florrick ,
i think you have a real opportunity ...
alicia , good .
i need you to not talk about your campaign .
oh , god , there is no campaign .
exactly , i need you not to talk about it .
where &apos;s peter ?
other side of the stage . why ?
have you seen peter ?
oh , my god .
oh , no , but thank you . i &apos;m gloria steinem .
yes . i know . uh , alicia florrick .
i know that and , also , i know that your husband
is already speaking . they just introduced him .
but i hear you &apos;re going to run
for state &apos;s attorney . that &apos;s great .
oh , uh , no , it &apos;s , um , a little ...
that was a little premature .
why ?
because i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m ...
not sure if i &apos;m running .
and why aren &apos;t you sure ?
well , i &apos;m a bit overwhelmed at the moment . you know-- life , work .
okay , but show me the woman who isn &apos;t overwhelmed .
that is true , yes , but this is ... i &apos;m ...
it wasn &apos;t my idea .
my @-@ my husband &apos;s , um , chief of staff--he asked me to run .
would you do a good job ? you would .
well , that &apos;s not ... that @-@ that &apos;s not the point .
no , i think it is the point . i think if you would
do a good job , you should run .
people respect you . and you could make a difference .
we need more good women to run .
now please welcome feminist icon gloria steinem .
alicia , it was great talking to you ,
but i &apos;m serious . do run .
it &apos;s very nice talking to you , alicia .
you could make it all the way to the supreme court , alicia .
you &apos;re that amazing .
thank you all . after much reflection and prayer
and returning to scripture with an open heart ,
i realized that i was wrong .
knowledge of sin is to some extent irrelevant .
so i will hear arguments now
on the fact of ed &apos;s seeds being planted on wendell &apos;s land ,
not just the intent .
del , we maintain our objection .
i understand .
so ...
you may call your next witness ,
alicia , dean , cary .
derek voss . i am a forensic botanist .
mr. pratt hired me to do a field study
on plants containing his seed &apos;s genetic marker .
after testing mr. keller &apos;s , uh , fields , what did you find ?
i found that his fields went from an acceptable six percent ,
uh , of mr. pratt &apos;s seeds to 89 % in one year .
can that be explained by , uh , blow @-@ in ?
no ,
it &apos;s my conclusion that he &apos;s saving and replanting seeds .
thank you .
del , i &apos;ll be frank .
this is bad science .
we need an independent test using
top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line dna sequencers .
and how long would that take ?
two months .
oh , come on , that is a delaying tactic , del .
you know this is untrue , wendell .
you &apos;ve been replanting my seeds .
with the herbicide you were using ,
you would have killed off everything except our plants .
you know that .
excuse me , don &apos;t talk to my client , sir .
no , let them talk .
no , del ,
please instruct mr. pratt this is not a free @-@ for @-@ all .
no . i agree--
it &apos;s time for the two of them to talk it out .
wendell , i know you don &apos;t live with your head in the sand .
you &apos;re a good man .
a good steward of the earth .
just tell the truth .
wendell , shall we take a break ?
no .
i &apos;ve been replanting your seeds .
i know it &apos;s against the law ,
but it &apos;s a rotten law .
i had no choice .
your seeds were taking over my land .
you control over 90 % of the market , ed .
you control the food .
when you control the food ,
you control the people .
i &apos;m sorry , del .
i lied earlier .
i knew what i was doing .
i lied before god .
and i &apos;m sorry .
thank you , wendell . thank you for sharing that .
del .
we thank wendell for his honesty .
but , again : that makes this case simpler .
yes , it does .
wendell , since you &apos;ve admitted to the infringement ,
i have no choice but to find ...
del , excuse me .
i submit the admission is moot .
what ?
he just ...
why ?
there can be no infringement because ...
the patenting of life is an affront to god .
are you kidding me ?
they &apos;re messing with nature . the bible says
god &apos;s creation is good .
what about weeds ? are weeds good ?
because our client knows how to get rid of weeds ,
and your client likes that .
our client has spent $ 400 million
on r &amp; d for a product that is feeding the world .
dean , they own one gene .
no , what &apos;s ridiculous is mrs. florrick not being able to ...
what &apos;s ridiculous is that you don &apos;t allow me to finish questioning ...
look , i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll pay you for the seeds i used ,
and i guess i &apos;m your customer .
but i &apos;d appreciate a discount .
i think that &apos;s a good idea .
they own one gene in one seed . they don &apos;t own the plant .
they don &apos;t own the sun .
&quot; render unto caesar
what is caesar &apos;s and unto god god &apos;s ...
what is god &apos;s . &quot;
now you &apos;re just quoting random bible verses .
are you good ?
yeah . you ?
thanks .
we settled it .
who is that , mrs. wagner ?
the man you &apos;re kissing .
it &apos;s not your husband , is it ? it &apos;s not trey ?
was that a no , ma &apos;am ?
that was a no .
thank you .
we were able to i.d. him as ellison mcfarlane .
is he your boyfriend , mrs. wagner ?
objection , your honor . relevance .
your honor , mr. mcfarlane &apos;s rap sheet is extensive .
assault and battery , armed robbery , possession .
he is a dangerous man , with whom mrs. wagner has been carrying on
an affair for over a year .
she wanted a new life . she wanted trey gone .
that &apos;s not true .
objection , your honor .
this is pure conjecture with no basis in fact .
yep , you &apos;re right , mr. polmar .
then again , i &apos;m not sure how much fact you &apos;ve got either .
i will rule tomorrow . in the meantime , mr. agos ,
try showing up on time , and stay close to home .
next .
so no money ?
yep .
well , at least they &apos;re friends .
good working with you .
you , too .
do you still believe in god ?
do i ? yeah .
you ?
no .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m genetically built to believe in god .
i didn &apos;t think i was either .
until i was .
alicia , do you have a minute ?
talk to you later , alicia .
who &apos;s that ?
a new partner . i was just heading home , eli .
this will only take a minute .
peter needs to endorse tomorrow for state &apos;s attorney ,
and i &apos;m putting together a list of the top contenders .
i can &apos;t put your name on that list , is that right ?
that &apos;s right .
do you have any other suggestions ?
harold lutz .
no , we asked him .
diane lockhart .
same . she said no .
well , who else is peter considering ?
there was only one name .
well , i &apos;m not running .
i know .
he knows . that &apos;s not the name .
it &apos;s not ? what @-@ what &apos;s the name ?
james castro .
oh , come on , eli .
he &apos;s not endorsing ...
castro is a bad man .
yes ,
and peter will grit his teeth and do it .
james castro &apos;s the only one who can win ,
and peter needs to back a winner .
nice try .
what ?
trying to psych me into saying yes .
no , alicia , not everything is about you .
peter is endorsing castro .
he is a bad man , but sometimes the world needs bad men .
unless you have another name .
no .
you .
okay , thanks .
if i think of another name , i &apos;ll let you know .
yeah . by tomorrow . peter needs to endorse tomorrow .
otherwise it looks like he &apos;s following the crowd .
alicia ,
i &apos;m tired . i need you to take over for me .
... never say such a thing . i don &apos;t know why he &apos;d say that .
i never heard him say such a thing .
no , i @-@ i did ...
i have to go .
did you have any questions , ms. grubick ?
yes .
let me see .
as i said , i &apos;m cary agos &apos; pretrial services officer ,
and i just had a few questions for you as his lawyer
before i submitted my report to the court .
that is why i &apos;m here .
i understand you fired mr. agos a year ago .
yes , at his old firm . my old firm .
and , actually , that wasn &apos;t the first time you fired him , was it ?
no . once before .
so ... how secure is his job right now ?
very .
my job is less secure than his .
but it &apos;s my understanding he &apos;s lost many of his clients .
well , some of his clients .
and that has not become an issue ?
that &apos;s the issue . i have to impress clients .
you don &apos;t .
whose name &apos;s on the letterhead ?
okay , wait , wait .
no , no issue at all .
and there &apos;s no tension between cary and his coworkers ?
three years ago
i could have had my name on the letterhead .
cary , let &apos;s just listen , okay ?
all right , we need to expand .
i mean , this is a charming space , but our clients are used to more .
your clients ?
i only say &quot; our clients &quot; because they &apos;re more in danger
of leaving for lockhart / gardner .
so what do we do ? we have nowhere to go .
uh , the floor above us has just become available ,
so i propose we @-@ we build up .
hmm , it is my understanding that mr. agos &apos; bond
has come from his workplace , your workplace .
that is true .
it &apos;s a lot of money .
is there any chance the bond would be rescinded
due to financial issues or any other reasons ?
can we afford it ? the second floor ?
well , dean and i talked ,
and we would be willing to finance the first year &apos;s rent
via a personal loan to the firm .
really ?
in exchange for the loan , uh ,
we would like an executive committee
comprised of three partners from florrick @-@ agos
and three partners from lockhart / gardner .
no , the bond is secure .
okay .
is there anything else you want to tell me ?
no .
all right , then .
thank you .
this has not been an easy decision .
on the one hand , the defense has presented a reasonable
alternate theory to trey wagner &apos;s disappearance ,
but they haven &apos;t backed it up with evidence .
the prosecution , meanwhile , has a great deal of evidence ,
but nothing that leads one
directly to the conclusion that they would like .
i am left with a tie .
so i &apos;ve asked the defendant &apos;s pretrial services officer to weigh in ,
and i &apos;d like her recommendation on the record .
oh , god . i &apos;m screwed .
do you have a recommendation for the court ?
i do .
please .
in my sessions with mr. agos and , uh , collateral witnesses ,
i saw a man who is terrified of going back to jail .
he was a deputy state &apos;s attorney ,
and , uh , there are prisoners inside who he put there ,
so that makes him a flight risk .
uh ... but i also saw a man
who is fighting for his business ,
determined to get his life back .
it is my opinion he knew enough of the risks to not intimidate
or order the intimidation of any witness .
i have concluded that mr. agos
has not broken any of the conditions of his bond .
thank you , mrs. grubick .
you may step down . so there you have it .
mr. agos , you will remain free on bail .
next .
you have something to say to me ?
no .
i doubt that . men always have something to say .
no . after i put your partner away for 15 years ,
then i &apos;ll have something to say .
if you &apos;re still in office .
oh , so ... that &apos;s why you &apos;re running ,
to get your partner off the hook .
or so you can keep your client ,
lemond bishop , out of jail .
or because your lover was gunned down in one of my courts .
that &apos;s the rumor , anyway .
will gardner was your lover .
you blame me for his death ,
and that &apos;s why you &apos;re running .
retribution .
anything else ?
what do you want ?
no .
get it all off your chest .
oh , i have a lot on my chest .
i &apos;ll save it for the campaign .
talk to you .
alicia .
how are you ?
if i ran ... what &apos;s the plan ?
