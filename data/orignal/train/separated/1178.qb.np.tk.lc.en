oh , careful , em , they &apos;re already pretty strong .
i &apos;ve gotten really good at this .
forget it .
she was driving that night , guys . i remembered .
you have to promise not to tell .
that you can see ?
i am still a target . you owe it to me .
all of you !
my mom was in a car accident .
she felt like someone was trying to run her off the road .
are you emily fields ?
yes .
i &apos;m maya &apos;s cousin nate .
what was my mother doing here ?
i can &apos;t talk .
my new attorney made me promise .
it &apos;s lucas . what is he doing out so late ? shh !
there &apos;s no more &quot; a , &quot; so why are you lying to me now ?
i feel like i only exist in half of your life .
i &apos;m done , hanna .
what do you think mona said to wilden ?
if she knows that we were at ali &apos;s grave that night--
we would be in jail right now .
i thought hanna was joining us for dinner .
hanna hasn &apos;t eaten since tuesday .
should we grab a pizza and go over there ?
no , unless the topping is caleb .
if you guys want to to see her , can you just go without me ?
i already feel bad enough that i convinced her to tell caleb .
with or without you she was backed into a corner .
this &quot; a &quot; does not feel like a high school girl playing games .
ok , well , if you figure out those rules ,
can you tell the rest of us ?
you know what ? i &apos;m not really hungry .
me either .
my stomach &apos;s in a knot .
so &apos;s my neck .
i haven &apos;t been able to brush the back of my head in , like , a year and a half .
spence , don &apos;t let wilden freak you out .
ok , if the police really knew that we were lying about the lake house--
not just the lake house .
what about the negatives of that picture ,
ali &apos;s missing body , all the things we buried with her--
any of that could get us arrested .
it &apos;s my neck again .
are they going to jenna &apos;s ?
garrett &apos;s .
well , who else lives in his house besides his parents ?
i don &apos;t think they &apos;ve been outside since he was arrested .
having a son in jail for two murders
might keep you indoors .
that &apos;s his mom . that &apos;s mrs. reynolds .
you guys .
what ? what is it ? what ?
what ?
there , over there .
there was a hoodie watching .
what are you saying ?
you think &quot; a &quot; was out here watching us ?
are you sure ?
why , why would &quot; a &quot; care about garrett &apos;s mother ?
maybe &quot; a &quot; wanted her out of the house .
here &apos;s your bright @-@ eye .
oh . thank you .
and the world &apos;s biggest bear claw .
what &apos;s in here ?
they had that turkey baguette on the menu that you love .
you got me two of them .
and ... roasted veggies and pickles .
pickles come with .
ah . well , let me--
oh , no . it &apos;s my treat .
what ? you &apos;ll have something for later .
okay , you have one lime in your fridge . one .
and it &apos;s growing fur .
thank you , i appreciate it ,
but you don &apos;t have to feed me .
i have my savings , my tutoring gigs--
i &apos;m fine . really .
it &apos;s just a turkey--
it &apos;s not necessary .
i have to get going . i have an interview at 8 : 30 .
hello ? still want a ride ?
yeah .
please , just give me back my stuff !
paige ?
hey , emily . what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;ve been meaning to call you .
you have ? why ?
i was wondering if you were free tomorrow night .
for ?
i got tickets to see the katy perry movie .
hanna &apos;s a big fan , but turns out she has other stuff going on .
boy stuff .
come on , a behind @-@ the @-@ scenes look at miss &quot; firework . &quot;
don &apos;t you want to know what makes her sizzle ?
it &apos;ll be fun . you in ?
i guess .
i haven &apos;t heard from you since--
i know . i &apos;ve had a ton of makeup tests to do ,
and senior year &apos;s been kicking my butt .
if you don &apos;t want to go--
no , i do .
that &apos;s not it .
i just thought you were avoiding me .
i wasn &apos;t avoiding you .
m @-@ maybe i was , but not intentionally .
i &apos;ve just been going through a lot
and needed to figure some stuff out .
okay . let &apos;s do it .
fresh start , right ?
yeah .
you said tomorrow night ?
you haven &apos;t heard ?
she had more surgery before school .
she can see again .
i &apos;m happy for her . it &apos;s pretty amazing .
mrs. welch was slobbering all over her in the parking lot .
text me deets about katy perry .
see you tomorrow .
congratulations .
thanks .
hey , what are you still doing here ?
what are you still doing here ?
i &apos;m the mother . i get an answer first .
i don &apos;t feel well .
have you heard from caleb ?
do we know how his mother is ?
i would if he &apos;d respond to my texts .
listen , i know you two left things unresolved .
it &apos;s resolved . he left me .
hanna , that &apos;s just for right now .
okay ? you don &apos;t know what the future might hold .
but the future &apos;s not gonna hold much of anything
if you don &apos;t get an education . you need to go to school .
do you have plans tomorrow ?
uh ... yeah .
i &apos;m going to listen to every sad song i &apos;ve ever downloaded , on repeat .
my boss volunteered the bank staff to help out
at a rummage sale at the church .
we &apos;re still short a couple of people .
oh , no , please don &apos;t .
it &apos;ll be fun .
you can help sort the clothes .
you love clothes .
new clothes .
really ?
fine . send me to church .
hanna .
gonna go to school wearing that ?
whatever .
right .
what happened to keeping a low profile ?
staying blind because she &apos;s a target ?
look at her . how can you miss her ?
she &apos;s been gliding around
school all day like a thanksgiving float .
we should say something to her .
no . wait .
did you get aria &apos;s text about lucas
and the photo studio ?
yeah . what was that about ?
aria says that she knows the photographer who owns the studio ,
and it &apos;s on the same block
where she and hanna saw lucas on that night .
so now we think lucas
took the photos in the graveyard ?
well , maybe , but then why was he pounding to get in there ?
i can &apos;t think about this now . i have a calculus test .
wait , em . there &apos;s something else .
my mom left her tablet out on the table this morning .
what is this ?
they &apos;re letting garrett out .
to see his mother . it &apos;s called compassionate furlough .
what has he done to deserve compassion ?
she &apos;s probably really sick .
so basically they &apos;re giving him a get @-@ out @-@ of @-@ jail @-@ free card ?
this just might be his last time to say goodbye to her .
at least he gets a chance .
do you want to talk about this later ?
what &apos;s there to talk about ?
we have no power-- who cares what we think ?
i do .
what if &quot; a &quot; put garrett &apos;s mom in the hospital
to get garrett out of jail ?
maybe the plan is to meet
up with the person who &apos;s really helping him .
it would explain what aria saw hiding in the shadows last night .
em , mona might not be the only person
in rosewood who owns a black hoodie .
don &apos;t look . she &apos;s coming over here .
who ?
the float . she &apos;s carrying something . envelopes .
what &apos;s in them ?
anthrax .
hi . here &apos;s one for you , and one for you .
i haven &apos;t seen aria or hanna .
can i trust that you &apos;ll pass them on ?
what is this ?
oh , they &apos;re invitations . it &apos;s my birthday .
and you recovered just in time .
the doctors say it &apos;s a positive outcome .
no . what the hell is this jenna ?
i thought you needed protection . we had a deal .
well , this is the new deal :
i feel a lot safer when i &apos;m in charge of what happens to me .
hope to see you at the party .
can you take a pot of decaf over to the alcove ?
oh , and please tell me you &apos;re free tomorrow night .
why ?
the guest list keeps expanding ,
so might need you to work this birthday party .
well , i can &apos;t , because i &apos;m on the guest list .
oh . that &apos;s perfect . you &apos;re already gonna be here anyway .
how often do you get paid to go to a party ?
but i wasn &apos;t gonna come because i have other plans .
well , they better include showing up here and keeping your job .
i thought i put the quinceanera photos in this book .
i need a sherpa .
oh . thanks , emily . have you met laurel ?
she &apos;s taking the pictures at my party .
laurel tuchman , this is emily fields .
we are ... friends from school .
cool . listen , i &apos;m sorry for the mess ,
i always take up extra space .
oh , no , no . any more caffeine and my hair will straighten itself .
this is decaf .
oh , well , then pour away .
emily , would you mind just closing the curtain a little bit ?
the light is still too much .
sure .
normally i would have had my assistant send all this over ,
but i just got rid of him .
note to self : don &apos;t hire a thief .
what happened ?
well , it &apos;s a long story .
he was stealing supplies , developing his own work .
then he had the nerve to come back
and demand i give him his negatives .
i told him , &quot; listen , anything you left ,
it belongs to me until you pay me what you owe me . &quot;
you know what &apos;s going on , right ?
they &apos;re letting garrett out .
he &apos;s gonna be free , walking down the street .
not really . he &apos;ll be handcuffed , nate .
there &apos;ll be a guard with him--
since the court is gonna be so generous ,
how about they grant me permission to ...
nate , stop .
why aren &apos;t you angry ?
i was . i am .
look , i know he took away someone we both love ,
but he &apos;s about to lose someone he loves , too .
so what ?
he doesn &apos;t deserve to see the sky or breathe fresh air again .
i know . i &apos;m with you on this , okay ?
but you have to let things play out the way they &apos;re meant to be .
i &apos;m on the clock , i have to get back to work .
can you just hang out here for a bit ?
you bought him groceries ?
it was not groceries . it was two sandwiches .
and believe me , i &apos;m still paying for it .
you should have seen the look he gave me .
well , he &apos;s your boyfriend , aria , he &apos;s not a baby squirrel .
just trying to do the right thing .
totally wrong .
i &apos;ve been there , done that .
every time you baby @-@ squirrel ezra
you &apos;re taking away his nuts .
you did not just say that .
i did . but i don &apos;t think that i meant to .
is that emily ?
ezra .
did he find his nuts ?
he just got an invitation to jenna &apos;s birthday party .
wait . now fitz is invited ?
yeah . apparently jenna wants to see her favorite teacher
for the first time .
what the hell is she up to ?
spencer , how are you able to write a paper during all this ?
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m breaking and entering into my mom &apos;s email account .
why ?
because i want to see what time garrett &apos;s being released .
you want to stand outside the hospital and protest ?
no . i want to be inside , so i can see who he &apos;s really visiting .
and my guess is that face is gonna be a lot easier to read
under hospital lights than a street lamp .
okay , great . thanks .
they said we could use the katy perry movie
tickets next weekend instead .
i &apos;m so embarrassed .
i invite you to do something , and then i cancel .
i &apos;m sure it will be just as fun in seven days .
besides , i get to see you tomorrow night anyway .
yeah . wearing this .
you bought a clip @-@ on tie ?
kevin said the birthday girl was set on a certain look .
fourth grade student council ?
i &apos;m not even sure how this works .
can i help ?
this is harder than it looks .
you know what , this is too short .
i have a real tie that i wore to a costume party .
can you check that cabinet and see if it &apos;s in there ?
sure .
so , were you surprised that jenna invited you to this ?
kind of . we &apos;re not exactly chummy .
we were lab partners once , but she sorta scared me .
is this yours ?
what ?
careful , em . they &apos;re already pretty strong .
oh , yeah . i-- i forgot that was in there .
it &apos;s nice .
it &apos;s a mistake .
i meant to toss it ,
but i was afraid my mom would find it in the garbage .
there &apos;s still something in it .
paige ,
if you want it , it &apos;s yours .
really . i &apos;m done with that .
you sure you don &apos;t need a lift ? it &apos;s not out of the way .
no , i &apos;m good . i still have a few things to take care of here .
i will see you tomorrow .
hmm . must be great to say that and mean it .
take care .
thanks .
that &apos;s beautiful .
thanks .
are you an architecture student ?
we &apos;ll see . maybe someday .
do you ever ... draw people ?
i have .
but , uh , they tend to look more like buildings .
well , i &apos;m impressed .
well , where is my invitation ? i want to at least see it .
are you coming from yoga ?
no , home .
why are you dressed like that ?
because , spencer ,
i &apos;m too depressed to work a zipper , all right ? get over it .
who &apos;s she talking to ?
emily , who apparently has to work jenna &apos;s party .
seriously ?
well , i can beat that .
i have to spend my saturday night
sorting out velour track suits at church .
why ? my mom found out that i cut school ,
and now she signed me up for a triple shift .
if you thought i was depressed before ...
it gets weirder .
what &apos;s up ?
hey , han , how are you feeling ?
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve seen you in sweats--
she can &apos;t work a zipper .
just move on . what did emily say ?
so , paige is invited to the party too ,
and now laurel tuchman is shooting it .
laura tucks @-@ what ?
laurel tuchman .
the photographer that i took a class from last summer .
go on .
well , emily may have overheard
why lucas was banging on that door .
laurel fired her assistant
because he was using the studio to develop his own prints .
and now he wants the negatives .
where are you going with this ?
to an open grave that he took pictures of .
and you think lucas dug it up by himself ?
the kid can barely lift his chemistry book .
well , he &apos;s tall enough to reach the pedals on a backhoe .
let &apos;s just stay with jenna , all right ?
that &apos;s who emily remembers driving that car that night .
why can &apos;t she be it ?
they can all be it .
spencer &apos;s right .
why is garrett being released the same night of jenna &apos;s party ?
exactly . what is the purpose of this party ?
is it really to celebrate jenna &apos;s birthday ,
or is it just to get us all in the same room
so she can drop a vat of pig &apos;s blood on us ?
she &apos;s not dropping anything on me .
i won &apos;t be there . no one will .
who wants to go to that stupid party anyways ?
me .
wioh , am i done ?
you &apos;ve been here barely an hour .
that can &apos;t be true .
just think of it as the school day you missed .
have you eaten anything ?
no .
that bra over there kind of put me off my feed .
they just put some food out . i &apos;ll see what i can find you .
i can &apos;t vouch for the egg salad ,
but the peanut butter cookie : four stars .
hmm . thanks for the tip .
here .
thanks .
you on your way out ?
i finished my shift earlier .
i just came back to check on my daughter .
who &apos;s your daughter ?
hanna marin . she &apos;s sorting clothes .
oh , right . yeah . she &apos;s a terrific worker .
um , maybe i &apos;m thinking of somebody else .
yeah , maybe i am too .
you &apos;re with the group from the bank , right ?
i am .
yeah , this is an important cause for my boss .
we volunteer every year .
well , we &apos;re grateful to have as many hands as possible .
i &apos;m still new here , so just trying to get acquainted .
well , you &apos;re name @-@ tag says &quot; volunteer coordinator . &quot;
that &apos;s more than acquainted ; that &apos;s committed ... ted .
jumpin &apos; in with both feet , i guess .
good way to meet people ... ashley .
so is splitting a cookie with a stranger .
we &apos;re not strangers-- we split a cookie .
what does that make us if we split another ?
married ?
not yet , but i will .
if i can just bump into her , i will get some answers
about what lucas was really doing in that studio .
spence , i gotta go .
what are you doing ?
you leave my lime alone .
i was just going to pet it .
you could do that ,
or we could head over to new hope and hang out before dinner .
we &apos;re going to dinner in new hope ?
yeah , is that a problem ?
no ... no .
i just thought that we would go
somewhere around here so we could stop by jenna &apos;s party .
i thought i mentioned that to you .
you did , but i-- i didn &apos;t think you were serious .
i don &apos;t have to go to that party , and neither do you .
i know i don &apos;t , but i &apos;d like to .
really ? given your history with her ?
that &apos;s exactly what it is : history .
you were the first one to say that , anyway .
look , it &apos;s incredible what she &apos;s gone through ,
and if she wants to include me--us--
it &apos;s the least we can do to be there .
that &apos;s it . i can &apos;t wait .
wait for what ?
this .
open it .
they don &apos;t make these cameras anymore ,
and it &apos;s kind of indestructible , so it probably still works .
but--
but nothing .
you &apos;re welcome .
thank you .
come on . let &apos;s go to a party .
okay , so he &apos;s finally chosen some flowers ,
which are hideous and tacky and mostly carnations ,
but there &apos;s not really much selection around here .
is he handcuffed at least ?
yeah . and he has two guards with him .
hold on .
what &apos;s happening ?
he &apos;s writing a note for the flowers .
why would he be doing that ?
so she &apos;ll know who they &apos;re from .
his mom is in a coma . she &apos;s not doing a lot of reading .
i gotta go .
fine .
uh , i &apos;ll call you later . bye , dad .
i get it .
he &apos;s despicable and he &apos;s hurt people who were close to you .
but his mother &apos;s dying . that &apos;s her son .
so two guards weren &apos;t enough ? they had to send you too ?
i &apos;ve still got a missing body to find .
it &apos;s my job , not yours .
what are you looking for ?
i &apos;m just here to pick up the ... test results
of my field hockey physical .
you know what ? you used to be a much better liar .
nice tie .
thanks . i can &apos;t wait to take it off .
when you do , can you wrap it for me ?
i forgot to bring a gift .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
i wanted to make sure this night wasn &apos;t a complete bust for you .
who &apos;s that ?
nate .
m @-@ maya &apos;s cousin .
i &apos;ll take that .
i &apos;ll be right back .
you &apos;ve been here a while . you want to take a break ?
can i be done ?
you could , but if you &apos;re taking that jacket with you ...
oh . no , i was gonna buy that .
here . do i pay you ? i only have a twenty .
i &apos;ll get your receipt .
wait . um , do you know where this last box of clothes came from ?
i don &apos;t .
why ? does it matter ?
no . i was just curious .
em , call me . i &apos;m still at the church ,
and i just found--
i thought that you and spencer got rid of all of your clothes--
the gray jacket from that night ?
it just came out of a donation box . why is it here ?
nate . what are you--
i was hoping you were gonna be working tonight .
were you invited to this ?
last minute invitation .
i met jenna here yesterday afternoon .
i figure it was either come to this or sit in my empty apartment
and punch holes in the wall .
truth is , i don &apos;t know how long i &apos;ll stay .
i &apos;m not in the mood to party .
but i gotta say , she &apos;s pretty intriguing .
why ? what did she tell you ?
enough to get me to buy a new shirt .
i want to know more .
no , you don &apos;t .
what does that mean ?
nothing .
i should probably pass these around before they dry out .
what are those ?
dried out .
hi ! you made it .
i was ... flattered for the invitation .
we both were .
happy birthday .
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t mean to stare .
i &apos;m just still adjusting and trying to match faces in reality
to the ones that i saw in my head .
no , it must be overwhelming .
is that laurel tuchman ?
she &apos;s the photographer i took a class from last summer .
she &apos;s amazing .
i didn &apos;t want to leave it to amateurs .
i wanted someone who could record every single moment .
i &apos;m gonna go say hi . i &apos;ll be right back .
laurel ?
hey , aria .
this girl &apos;s got some classy friends . how ya doin &apos; ?
i &apos;m good . yeah , i &apos;m still taking pictures .
actually , my boyfriend , he just
gave me this vintage camera . it &apos;s a rolleiflex .
god , nice boyfriend . when i was i high school ,
i couldn &apos;t afford a pinhole and a light bulb .
oh , he &apos;s not in high school .
are those expensive ?
honey , if it works , he must have dropped a precious penny on it .
listen , i &apos;d love to stay and chat , but i gotta keep snapping .
i &apos;m flying solo .
are you here alone without an assistant ?
don &apos;t ask .
i &apos;m in the market if you know anyone who &apos;s interested .
i &apos;m interested .
really ?
yeah . well , call me on monday . hopefully by then
i &apos;ll have gotten rid of what &apos;s left of the old one .
is he still there ?
well , just his camera bag .
i &apos;m holding it hostage till
he gets mommy and daddy to write me a check .
hey ! need some help ?
i wish , but you can &apos;t .
my manager sees me hanging , he &apos;ll freak out .
he wasn &apos;t upset you were hanging out with maya &apos;s cousin ?
nate ?
no , we weren &apos;t hanging out .
we were just--
it &apos;s complicated .
hi , paige .
hi .
what &apos;s up ?
nothing . we &apos;ll talk later .
you know , i &apos;m leaving .
i shouldn &apos;t really be back here anyway .
it &apos;s a no @-@ friend zone .
what are you looking for ?
laurel &apos;s equipment . she said it was back here .
yeah , it &apos;s right there .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ? !
i &apos;m getting into her studio tonight .
方便的时候给我电话
toby . hey , what are you doing here ?
your parents were on their way out . they let me in .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i thought that by getting my own place above the brew
that i could escape my screwed @-@ up family .
right . and it does not help
when they throw birthday parties right below you .
do your parents expect you to make an appearance
at this coming @-@ out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ dark party ?
they can expect all they want .
i &apos;ll wait for the she &apos;s @-@ leaving @-@ rosewood party .
i &apos;m gonna throw you that party .
are you okay with me barging in like this ?
i mean , did you have plans ?
i , um , i did , actually .
i just have this really big french test coming up .
i have to read that massive book .
which means that you should totally stay .
good . that &apos;s what i was hoping you &apos;d say .
toby .
how is it possible that you and i are the only two people
that know that jenna was faking for so long ?
i think most people want to buy into a happy ending .
yeah , but your parents-- how did she fool them ?
i mean , they were living in the same house .
did they just not notice that she was able to see ?
did she sleep with her sunglasses on ?
she told my parents a few weeks ago
that she started seeing
shadows over the summer , and then blurry figures .
and they just bought that she
didn &apos;t mention this in her letters home from camp ?
she said she was scared--
scared that it might suddenly go back to darkness
and she &apos;d have to live with everyone pitying her even more .
it &apos;s so weird .
what ?
that the most honest person i know has to share parents
with the most deceitful person in this town .
can we not discuss that person ?
hey , where have you been ?
bathroom . everything okay ?
you kind of ditched me back there .
with jenna . so can we go ?
no . i don &apos;t want to be rude .
jenna can see now ,
she &apos;ll know we left before the cake .
we are not staying for cake . we have a dinner reservation .
just a couple more minutes .
emily had to tell me something .
can you wait one second ?
what are you doing ? !
looking for a coconut .
these vanilla ones are gross .
would you please stop ?
i &apos;m gonna stop till i find a coconut .
paige . can i get you some coffee ?
is she drunk ?
no , i &apos;m not drunk , i &apos;m hungry .
and your cupcakes taste like old pennies .
paige , you and i--
oh . really ?
finally , you have time for me ?
all right , let &apos;s dance . let &apos;s dance .
i can &apos;t dance right now . i &apos;m working .
fine . i &apos;ll dance by myself .
are you okay ?
are you okay ? oh , my gosh .
can somebody get some ice , please ?
everybody back up .
are you okay ? don &apos;t move . be careful .
is she one of your friends ?
yes .
we should get her out of here .
okay , come on .
hannah .
hey . where &apos;s paige ?
getting stitches . um , this is nate ,
maya &apos;s cousin .
hi .
hey .
nate , would you mind getting us some coffee ?
they said it was gonna be a while .
yeah .
thanks .
i thought spencer was here .
she was .
she bumped into wilden and he scared her off .
this was at the church ?
is it yours ?
mine had a rip in the pocket that i sewed with a pink--
thread .
this is mine .
well , it hasn &apos;t been anywhere near a fire .
how did this get to the rummage sale ?
that can &apos;t be a coincidence .
spencer was right -- this &quot; a &quot; definitely has an agenda .
when did you take it off that night ?
because you didn &apos;t have it on at the graveyard , emily .
when we found you you were shivering .
i know i wore it to spencer &apos;s house . that &apos;s all i remember .
did you have it in jenna &apos;s car ?
did you leave it there ?
because if she &apos;s our pal now ,
why didn &apos;t she just give it back to you ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe ...
maybe jenna wasn &apos;t the only person i saw that night .
it &apos;s my mom .
i &apos;ve got to get back to the church
or i &apos;ll be sorting old pantyhose for the rest of my life .
hey . where &apos;s your friend ?
uh , she had to go meet her mom .
forgot to ask how you take it .
put cream in both of them .
thanks .
oh . can i help you ?
oh . yeah , i @-@ i was just looking for emily .
she took her friend to the hospital ,
and left me holding all of the cupcakes .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;s gonna be back .
i &apos;m not .
excuse me .
aria . what is going on ?
uh ... someone said that they just put out some stuffed mushrooms .
i don &apos;t want a mushroom . i want a dinner .
i know . and we will leave soon .
are we hanging out here because
you don &apos;t want to have this meal ?
i can afford to take you dinner , aria .
it &apos;s not necessary . you just bought me an expensive camera .
what does that have to do with it ?
you &apos;re spending money that you don &apos;t have .
i do have it .
i chose the restaurant in new hope because i wanted to celebrate .
celebrate what ?
the job i got today .
you got that editing job ? why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i thought it &apos;d be nicer at a private table
where we &apos;re not surrounded by people with silly hats .
oh , crap !
everything okay ?
it &apos;s all wet !
i don &apos;t have one dry memory card !
who &apos;s been using my equipment as a coaster ? !
i could run to your studio and grab you a couple more .
i can &apos;t ask you to do that .
you &apos;re not asking , i &apos;m offering . where are your keys ?
you &apos;re a doll . and you &apos;re officially hired .
tell her to take the job .
okay . her studio &apos;s down the street , and we &apos;ll be right back .
i &apos;ll call the restaurant and cancel the reservation .
no , don &apos;t . please .
just call them up , ask them to hold it for a little bit longer .
i will be right back .

lucas .
i need to get inside .
uh , studio &apos;s closed .
leave the door open and walk away .
i can &apos;t do that .
then drop the keys and let me find them .
lucas , get out of my way .
aria .
lucas . what &apos;s going on ?
is everything okay here ?
did you get what you needed ?
mind if i ask you a question ?
is paige just a friend , or something more ?
we dated for a while .
was that before maya , or after ?
it was kind of in between .
i &apos;ll be right back .
you get my text ?
why do you think i &apos;m here ? let &apos;s go upstairs .
no , i can &apos;t .
nate &apos;s here and paige is coming out any moment .
but if wilden left
that probably means garrett left too .
and we have to see what &apos;s on the card he stuck in those flowers .
hey ! garrett !
no ! nate , stop !
hey ! get off me !
let me go !
get off !
you didn &apos;t have to stay .
i wanted to . you were in there for a long time .
they gave me a few stitches , and they wanted to run a test .
why ?
i told the doctor how little i had to drink ,
and he wanted to do a tox screen .
turns out i wasn &apos;t messed up from the alcohol .
what do you mean ?
there were traces of milizopam in my system .
it &apos;s a sleeping pill .
the doctor asked if i set my cup down at any point
or drank from someone else &apos;s .
honestly , who knows ?
it &apos;s such a blur . i don &apos;t remember anything .
i need to call my parents .
my dad &apos;s gonna want to talk to the doctor .
here .
i don &apos;t want that on me when they get here .

are you home yet ?
i &apos;m still at ezra &apos;s . he &apos;s in the shower .
call me when you get home .
that might be a while .
why ? what &apos;s going on ?
well , i basically ditched him at jenna &apos;s party ,
so i &apos;m trying to smooth the waters .
have you looked at the negatives yet ?
i &apos;m doing it now . it &apos;s my first chance .
what are you typing ?
i &apos;m looking up milizopam .
is paige gonna be okay ?
she &apos;ll be fine until she realizes the drugs came from my flask .
it looks like these first two rolls are just yearbook stuff .
&quot; milizopam . a strong sedative prescribed for sleep disorders .
also used to subdue aggressive patients and inmates . &quot;
go on .
there &apos;s a list of side effects when mixed with alcohol .
top of the list , memory loss .
you were totally screwed with .
was that flask ever out of your sight that night ?
it was probably in there before i got to spencer &apos;s .
yeah , but why just you ? why weren &apos;t we all drugged ?
maybe that was the plan , aria .
lucky i wasn &apos;t in the mood to share that night .
em ...
does it say anything about what those pills look like ?
&quot; light blue and oval @-@ shaped . &quot;
with the letters m @-@ z @-@ m on them ?
yeah . how &apos;d you know ?
i &apos;m holding three of them ...
and they were in lucas &apos;s camera bag .
