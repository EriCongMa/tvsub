funny enough , uh , i crushed it .
i crushed it all day today , and then i crushed it some more .
and then it asked me what i was doing ,
and i told it that i was crushing it .
that &apos;s what i do on a daily basis , jess .
you used to inspire me .
i mean , not specifically--
because i find teaching to be icky-- but , you know ,
in a vague kind of &quot; look at that go @-@ getter in a ...
in a brightly colored sweater &quot; kind of way .
what happened to the inspiring , visor @-@ less jess ?
hey , maybe that &apos;s her .
hey , we just moved in across the hall .
i &apos;m chaz .
this is fife , sutton and brorie .
what &apos;s up ? schmidt .
any @-@ turds , just wanted to give you a heads up
that we &apos;re having some people over to hang tonight
and it might get a little loud .
i like where your head is at .
we &apos;re gonna be there with bells on .
dolla @-@ dolla bells , y &apos;all .
well , it &apos;s just going to be a bunch of young people .
so ...
hi . i live here , too .
what are you names ? schmidt !
so , when he said ,
&quot; it &apos;s just going to be a bunch of young people , &quot;
well , he must have meant , &quot; you , &quot;
meaning me , fellow young person ,
&quot; you &apos;ll feel right at home .
and you two walking corpses , stay away . &quot;
you &apos;re six months younger than me , schmidt .
you &apos;re a corpse for sure .
behold .
this actuarial table stops at age 99 .
but if you track my current trajectory ,
i &apos;m clearly gonna live till i &apos;m 123 years old , so ...
hello , robot sex .
is this accurate ?
no , no , no , winston , i spend $ 49.95 a month
on a subscription to an inaccurate
real @-@ time actuarial service .
then i think i may have died four years ago .
oh , yeah ? that sucks .
&quot; african @-@ american male , life expectancy : 67 years &quot; ?
sounds about right .
&quot; minus one year if you frequently question
your career choice . &quot; check .
&quot; minus one year if your chosen field offers
few opportunities for advancement . &quot;
check and double check .
i like getting older .
i feel like i &apos;m finally aging into my personality .
keep this crap out of my yard !
and turn that nonsense down !
they never did get that frisbee back .
i used that frisbee as a dish .
seriously ?
i used it for pistachios in my room .
not only am i the youngest person in this loft ,
i &apos;m also the most successful .
oh ! shut up , schmidt .
are you honestly measuring yourself like a little boy ?
i &apos;m sorry that you &apos;re not growing any more like me .
and apparently , i &apos;m gonna be growing forever .
i &apos;m like a jewish peter pan . petya pan .
petter pan . pesach pan .
why don &apos;t you take it down a notch
before this old man takes you outside
and makes you pick a switch ?
i &apos;m like snow leopard .
you guys are like dos .
and as your elder , can i give you a little advice , schmidt ?
can we talk for a sec ?
sure , yes , yes .
&apos;cause you &apos;ve kind of gotten under my skin a little bit .
shoot , gran torino .
i &apos;m gonna die so soon .
do you think that the neighbors will want , like ,
four individual casseroles
or , like , one large party @-@ size casserole ?

you missed an unreal hang last night .
unreal with a capital &quot; uh . &quot;
really ?
those kids with the found furniture
and no tv because it &apos;s cool ?
it &apos;s a different world over there .
a world where it &apos;s okay to only have a part @-@ time job .
a world where it &apos;s okay that i &apos;m still finding myself .
a world where i have not one , but two catchphrases .
$ 500 .
how rude !
how rude !
just take it !
they think i made those up .
there &apos;s just one tiny hitch .
it &apos;s very awkward , and i don &apos;t know how to say it ...
they hate schmidt .
so much . how did you know ?
if i had a dollar for everybody i couldn &apos;t hang out with
because they hated schmidt , i &apos;d be rich .
like , fill my gas tank all the way up rich .
he was all over the map .
he spent 20 minutes talking about aioli .
don &apos;t worry about it . i &apos;m on it .
what do you mean , you &apos;re on it ?
you &apos;re gonna prank him , aren &apos;t you ? i @-@ i knew it !
i knew it ! you &apos;re gonna prank him .
hey , can i help you ? i &apos;m really good with pranks ?
you may not help with the pranks .
why not , man ? i &apos;m the best with the pranks , man .
they call me &quot; prank sinatra . &quot;
no , you call you prank sinatra .
oh , come ... &apos; cause i am .
winston , you &apos;re the worst at pranks in the whole world .
no , i &apos;m not .
yes , you are !
you either go way too small ...
let &apos;s pour a little juice near her shoe .
... or you go way too big .
hey , let &apos;s hit her in the throat with a ski .
you don &apos;t have a pranking sweet spot .
speaking of ...
are you limping ?
my hip is achy .
i wonder if it &apos;s your shoes .
did you try different shoes ?
i try on four different pairs of shoes
with every outfit , rain or shine . you know that .
what did you do ?
well , he could try on 100 different pairs .
it &apos;s not going to matter .
the left heel is an eighth of an inch shorter
on every single pair .
this is so crazy , nick .
oh , my god , you know what we should do ?
we should take those shavings ,
and then sprinkle them by his car .
let me just get this clear .
take the little bit of dust
yeah , &apos; cause ...
and go outside and put it near his car ?
yes .
that &apos;s not a prank .
yes , it is .
that &apos;s just kind of littering .
his whole ride to work ,
okay , you &apos;re done .
he &apos;d be thinking , like , &quot; what ? &quot;
so we &apos;re pranking him
so he thinks while we &apos;re not around , &quot; what ? &quot;
it &apos;s too small .
you &apos;ve got to go bigger than that .
well , anyway ,
i got to fill this up with pee .
ew ! why ?
so i can pour it all over schmidt &apos;s bed
and make him think he &apos;s incontinent .
that &apos;s disgusting , nick .
hey , sometimes up close , art is ugly .
i got an idea .
instead of urine , we use acid .
and put it on his face !
all right ?
jess , do these pants seem long to you ?
nick picked them up from the dry cleaner for me today ,
and i don &apos;t know , i swear they seem longer .
i think your pants look fine .

um , they hate you .
that &apos;s crazy .
it is crazy ... how much they hate you .
watch . every time you say something ,
they &apos;re gonna change the subject immediately .

man , i &apos;ve never seen you work this hard at anything , ever .
that &apos;s because i care so much .
i set an alarm for 5 : 00 a.m.
so i could switch schmidt &apos;s fiber pills with placebos .
damn it , i want to care about something
as much as you care about ruining schmidt &apos;s life .
and where have you been all night , young lady ?
jumping around to your hippity @-@ hop ?
taking your drug pills and smoking your hash stick ?
i &apos;m actually asking-- i &apos;m not doing a thing right here .
those guys are so much fun .

for 48 hours , so i &apos;m gonna just sleep off an ass @-@ ton of quinoa .
no , there &apos;s no time for sleep ! guys , here &apos;s what we got to do .
we got to find the passion that we have in life ,
and we got to hold on to it .
you &apos;re so right .
just like--
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying this--
just like nick miller .

it &apos;s blasting , schmidt ! jess is trying to sleep !
you can hear this ?
uh , yes .
well , you know what , you were right .
they hate me , and i know why they hate me , too .
it &apos;s because i &apos;m old , and they &apos;re the future of humanity ,
a pan @-@ ethnic , pan @-@ sexual hive mind ,
and they want nothing to do with me .
they &apos;re not that great , schmidt .
last night , chaz and sutton
got in a fight .
a lovers &apos; quarrel ?
sutton and chaz are not a couple .
chaz is with fife ; brorie &apos;s with , uh ...
the other broad .

brorie , sutton and fife are in a triad ,
and chaz is a floater .
they &apos;re poly @-@ amorous ? damn it !

you &apos;re not old .
then how do you explain this ?
use your legs , buddy .
let me show you something .
gonna hurt your back .
look at this-- i &apos;m freaking shrinking !
i took a photo of the wall , shrunk it down ,
made a copy at an architect &apos;s office .
from there , it was just your basic spackle @-@ and @-@ silkscreen job .
i don &apos;t care , but ... yay .
it &apos;s a weird life , but it &apos;s where i &apos;m at right now .
okay .
jess ... this is the hardest thing i &apos;ve ever had to say .
please help me be cool .
say that one more time .
oh . visor @-@ wearing jess ,
will you please help me be cool ?
okay , listen up ,
i got 3.5 years to live .
i can &apos;t be an assistant any more .
i don &apos;t want to die . i want to work .
honestly , i want to work here .
but i got to follow my passion ,
much like a running back would want
when given the ball ,
and in the game of life ,
this job is the pigskin .
and damn it , i &apos;m in the red zone !
and in summation , i feel ...
very good about what i just said .
hopefully , you do , too .
who wants to start an arcade fire ?
schmidt .
what ?
what are you doing ?
this is not the outfit we talked about .
what ? rock and roll .
you way overshot it .
look at that . i &apos;m being ironic .
that &apos;s not ironic ; that &apos;s just a bad pun .
and what are you doing here ?
your arms are hot , but your neck is cold ?
hey , look at me .
if you guys keep a tight core ,
you can ... your burpees can look like this , too .
when &apos;s the olympics ? right , guys ?
i &apos;m gonna set a pr tonight .
well , you know , he &apos;s not ... he &apos;s not ...
parkour .
you got beer on her , man .

don &apos;t worry , my mom can throw that dress in
with my laundry next time she &apos;s here .
sorry . your mom does your laundry ?
washer @-@ dryer kind of freaks me out , you know ?
it &apos;s just , like , eh ...
on the noise .
okay , you know what ? it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll wash it myself .
all right .
thank you , though .
she &apos;s so iconoclastic and modern .
and she even got our dishwasher to work .
i remember .
you know ,
i mean , i just ... it wasn &apos;t that big a deal .
it was just ... i just ... i just turned it on .
there was a button that said &quot; on . &quot;
it &apos;s weird how the dishwasher just lives under the counter .
how come there &apos;s no dish @-@ dryer ?
or un @-@ washer .
oh , my god , you guys , are we the dish un @-@ washers ?
why don &apos;t we just move to prague ?
i need to focus on my art .
you can totally focus on your art in prague .
if we move to prague ,
should i paint my nails black again ?
hey , you guys , um ...
i can &apos;t hang out with you any more .
why not ?
because ...
our entire relationship &apos;s built on a lie .
jess , what are you talking about ?
i did not make up ...
jess , please don &apos;t ...
i have to introduce you to a ...
don &apos;t do it .
little , adorable african @-@ american nerd .
don &apos;t press the button . don &apos;t ...
jess , why would you do this to us ?
who &apos;s &quot; steve urclee &quot; ?
jess , what the hell was that ?
you were supposed to teach me how to be cool .
you did a terrible job . look what i &apos;m wearing .
you didn &apos;t listen to anything i said !
i told you to stop trying so hard .
i will never stop trying .
i don &apos;t care if i have to do a billion burpees .
that is how you crush-- you never give up .
that is the difference between me and you , jess .
is that what you think ? you think i just gave up ?
well ...
i was fired , schmidt .
do you think i wanted to stop teaching ?
that &apos;s why i liked hanging out with those kids--
&apos;cause they weren &apos;t judging me all the time
for not crushing it .
okay ...
do you think that i want to work
at the casserole shanty ?
do you know what the people i work with call it ?
the ass @-@ erole shanty .
just don &apos;t stop teaching .
i mean , there &apos;s got to be something .
i don &apos;t know , driver &apos;s ed , cpr ...
a smile class .
my life sucks so much right now .
but at least i &apos;m not 23 .
at least i own a trash can .
at least i can legally rent a car .
at least i don &apos;t live in a loft with three other ...
but you live with us .
but i live you with guys .
jess ?
we don &apos;t care if you stole your catchphrase
from some low @-@ budget web series .
we still want to hang out .
don &apos;t trust your government , kids .
oh , my god , it &apos;s the old man from the stairs .
i thought he died .
let &apos;s get out of here before his robe opens .
he &apos;s gonna get his old on you !
get out while you can !
hey , hey , charles ,
the decrepit thing that just walked by ,
now , that is old , okay ?
and you can hate him for being old ,
but you cannot hate me .
we don &apos;t hate you for being old .
we hate you &apos; cause you &apos;re a viciously unbearable ass @-@ head .
seriously ?
that &apos;s ... come here , that &apos;s ...
get off ! ass @-@ head !
ass @-@ head ! yeah !
i &apos;m not gonna drink it all .
guys ,
i ... am an ass @-@ head .
they don &apos;t hate me because i &apos;m old .
they hate me because of my personality .
i can totally change my personality .
congratulations , schmidt , that is ... that &apos;s weird news .
ladies and gentlemen ,
you are looking at a brand @-@ new man .
a man who has proved
so capable of talking about so little for so long ...
is now the producer of his very own sports talk show .
no way !
what ? !
that &apos;s right . that &apos;s right .
yeah , baby !
it &apos;s halftime in america !

thank you , thank you , thank you .
2 : 35 to 5 : 35 a.m.
boom ! prime time for truckers !
that &apos;s awesome . he &apos;s got something .
yes .
in other news , i just spent three days
trying to impress people who don &apos;t own bed frames .
well , if it makes you feel any better ,
i spent the last three days
pouring urine on a grown man &apos;s sheets .
can you imagine how much we would get done
if we just focused our energy
onto something a little bit more worthwhile ?
not to mention the money we would save .
i know .
wait , what money ?
i mean , i &apos;ve been running the numbers on this ,
but , you know , i think i spent ...
you know , $ 1,200 to $ 1,300 .
what ? !
on these pranks , yeah .
what ? !
and i was under- budget , so ...
under @-@ budget ?
what , you think fake contact lenses are free ?
they are not , sister .
nick , you don &apos;t have that kind of money .
i know i don &apos;t .
where are you gonna get that from ?
doesn &apos;t matter . i had to prank schmidt .
and i did .
holy crap .
i need a real job .
yeah , you do .
don &apos;t you ever prank me !
of course . you got it .
you &apos;ll never see it coming .
this is like the end of a horror movie .
or the beginning of a pranking movie .
there are no pranking movies .
yet . get out of here .
you &apos;ll never see it coming .
this prescription is blurry .
hi , schmidt .
is that you in tailored , grown @-@ up clothing ?
yeah . mama &apos;s gonna ride this blazer
all the way to a tutoring job .
thank goodness .
i almost thought i was gonna have to loan you money .
well , i said tutoring job , not venture capitalist .
proud of you nonetheless .
thanks .
what the hell ?
okay . all right , nick , very funny .
quite the prankster you are .
i &apos;m gonna hit your ass with a ski !
