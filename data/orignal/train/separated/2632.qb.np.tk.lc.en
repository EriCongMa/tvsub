you &apos;re gonna need it .
it &apos;s me . i &apos;m back .
how was chicago ?
oh , god , you know .
all these conferences are such a waste of time .
you -- how was your day ?
how was work ?
fine ... except for carlton .
again ?
he keeps leering at me -- gives me the creeps .
well , he &apos;s your boss .
sooner or later , you have to report him to h.r.
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re back .
i have a surprise for you .
you &apos;re giving me a drawer ?
only if you want it .
i mean , if it &apos;s too soon ...
i just thought it might be nice .

what you &apos;re asking me to do ...
i appreciate that you turned yourself in .
you came back for me .
liz , i &apos;m in danger . i need the passports .
i can &apos;t . i just can &apos;t .
liz , please !
turning myself in to save you saved me .
and not because the judge let me go .
i &apos;ve been running since i was 14 .
it &apos;s all i &apos;ve known .
and in that moment , when the judge let me go ,
i thought , &quot; maybe there &apos;s a world
where i don &apos;t have to run , where i could just ... &quot;
these germans want me dead -- my handler , too .
so , please , i need your help .
i need the passports .
they &apos;re not just passports .
you put them in a box under the floor in our home .
they represent everything i &apos;m trying to forget .
i know . i wouldn &apos;t ask unless it was important .
they &apos;re locked up in evidence .
that &apos;s exactly why they should still be clean .
i &apos;m not gonna walk into evidence and steal them for you .
why would i do that ?
you want me gone ?
do this , and you &apos;ll never see me again .
you need to leave .
go . now .
no .
get out .
i was out , remember ?
you &apos;re the one who brought me back in .
get out .
perhaps i haven &apos;t made myself clear .
i came home , and tom was here .
he &apos;s back in your life .
he is not in my life .
i understand what it &apos;s like
to be drawn to something that is unhealthy ,
to a part of yourself that you are afraid of .
but i want you to remember what your life really was with him ,
and imagine all that it could be without him .
i don &apos;t have to imagine .
good .
because i have a case .
toshiro osaka -- a japanese entrepreneur indicted in 2009
and knifed to death by an aggrieved business partner .
miles chapman -- he was gunned down in algiers
while avoiding extradition for insider trading .
lester charles conway -- his ponzi scheme was so massive ,
he &apos;s now serving up to 30 years .
their crimes cost hundreds of people their life savings --
pensions gone , homes in foreclosure ,
families torn apart .
why would i feel bad for them ? they &apos;re criminals .
according to reddington , they &apos;re innocent --
framed after months , sometimes years of planning
by a woman with a deep @-@ seated hatred for the 1 % .
she doesn &apos;t just take their money ,
she takes their reputations , their freedom ,
sometimes their lives .
her latest mark was declan salinger ,
a flamboyant venture capitalist who specialized in biotech .
he was found last night in a hotel bathtub ,
needle on the floor , dead from an apparent overdose .
his personal laptop was taken into evidence .
csi uncovered corporate withdrawals
in excess of $ 27 million .
navabi , go see salinger &apos;s wife .
ressler , keen , the man in prison -- talk to him .
if he was framed , i want to know how .
we spoke to your attorneys , mr. conway .
you claim to have been framed
by a woman named claudia sanchez .
or whatever her name really was .
she made everything up .
she make up the ponzi scheme ?
the $ 128 million you stole from your clients
to fund your lifestyle -- the ranch , the private jets --
look , i &apos;ve told this story a hundred times .
we were sleeping together .
she had access to everything -- my phone , computer , passwords .
if you don &apos;t believe me --
we want to believe you . we do .
tell us what happened .
she was a seasonal worker at the ranch --
undocumented , one of many .
my wife had no idea .
the affair lasted exactly six months .
then one day , she just disappears .
three days later , i &apos;m arrested .
well , they also found a packed bag in your car ,
and your passport , and a plane ticket to beijing .
she planted it all .
that woman -- she was diabolical .
from the fingerprints on the suitcase
to the airline ticket she purchased using my computer --
she got into my life .
abby issa .
but that was nothing .
the way she moved the money , her knowledge of how it worked ,
issuing false statements , creating shell companies .
i hired the best defense money could buy ,
and after they looked at the evidence against me ,
they recommended i cop a plea .
beretta 21a bobcat .
packs a nasty bite .
if i ever have to use it ,
that &apos;s exactly what i want it to do .
i pled guilty to a crime i didn &apos;t commit .
that &apos;s how good she was .
and the money she took ,
most of it belonged to my clients --
teachers , doctors , pension plans .
over 278 people lost everything because of some ... ghost .
never went to trial , but your lawyers --
you said that they gathered a lot of evidence .
we need to see it .
hello , roger .
the director called for a vote .
when ?
tomorrow .
i &apos;ve been quietly lobbying on your behalf .
i appreciate that .
no , you don &apos;t . you expect it .
where do things stand ?
i &apos;ve spoken to mitchum . he &apos;s with us .
that means brazil and south korea are , as well .
that likely positions jasper as the deciding vote .
if we can &apos;t secure his vote ,
the director will have a majority to act against you .
then jasper will have to be persuaded .
these are powerful men .
they don &apos;t respond to threats .
no .
with powerful men , one must appeal to their vanity .
listen to me , red .
the fulcrum -- if you have it ,
if you can prove you have it , do it now .
your life depends on it .
set the meeting .
mrs. salinger had a private detective follow her husband
and his assorted mistresses for two months ,
but he found nothing on this particular woman --
partial prints , burner phones ,
inconclusive selfies taken from the victim &apos;s phone .
conway &apos;s lawyers did three months of discovery
before copping a plea ,
and all they got were payroll records from his ranch
and a lot of fake green cards and social security numbers .
the lawyers interviewed as much staff they could find ,
but no one could or would positively i.d.
the woman conway alleges framed him .
two different cases , two sets of professional investigators ,
and this woman didn &apos;t leave a trace .
guys , check it out .
the detectives and the lawyers
may not have found anything conclusive on their own ,
but if you put the photos they found together ...
... our ghost has a face .
okay , so , i have this friend , osborne , in the forensics lab --
freaking osborne .
aram .
right . so , i scanned over 40 partial prints
conway &apos;s investigators found at his ranch ,
another 53 partials found
by mrs. salinger &apos;s private detective .
i fired them off to osborne .
he is a wizard with whorls , loops , and arches .
he managed to stitch together three partials
into a gorgeous , crystal @-@ clear left thumbprint .
ran it through afis , and bang .
her name is vanessa anne cruz .
36 years old .
last known address --
her mother &apos;s place in edison , new jersey .
get there . now .
abby ?
drink it .
take off your clothes .
abby ?
abby !
who the hell are you ? !
andy , from the front desk .
uh , she gave me 20 bucks and told me this key belongs to you .
aida hernandez ?
special agent donald ressler , special agent keen .
we &apos;re trying to locate your daughter , vanessa cruz .
my daughter ?
she &apos;s dead .
it &apos;s my fault .
vanessa never really had a good male role model .
her father was a creep ,
so i wasn &apos;t surprised when she married one .
wash , rinse , repeat .
excuse me ?
some women make the same mistakes with men
over and over again .
hernando was a young broker --
worked at a big firm .
turns out , he was a real crook .
he was doing insider trading , and when they caught him ,
he jumped off the george washington bridge .
and what happened to vanessa ?
oh , she thought they set him up .
she adored him till the end .
never questioned his innocence .
i tried to reason with her , but ...
take your time .
they found her folded clothing at rockaway beach .
they never found a body , but i know she was dead .
she &apos;d never abandon me .
she looked after you ?
she was such a beautiful person --
never a thought of herself , always of others .
and since she &apos;s been gone ?
vanessa made sure i &apos;d be well taken care of .
how did she do that ?
she had an insurance policy .
i kept up with the mortgage and made ends meet .
do you still have the policy ?
i never saw the policy .
but i have a letter that came with the check .
i &apos;m sure i can find that .
it turns out it &apos;s a fake .
what is ?
the entire company .
minnetonka bankers health &amp; life was incorporated in 2006 .
in nine years , the only policy it issued
was to cruz &apos;s mother .
it &apos;s a shelf corporation .
you mean &quot; shell &quot; corporation ?
no . &quot; shelf , &quot; with an &quot; f. &quot;
criminals file incorporation papers .
they pay all the fees . it &apos;s totally legitimate .
then then they put them on the shelf for years ,
sometimes decades .
they pay the minimum corporate tax ,
build up a credit rating , comply with filings
to create an established , creditworthy business
that can be used to launder all kinds of transactions .
including phony insurance payments .
guys ?
it looks like this isn &apos;t the only way
vanessa cruz has used shelf companies .
at least six other victims were all accused
of funneling money through shelf corporations
they say they didn &apos;t know existed .
samar , you said these corps are being sold to criminals .
if we could find the person who sold them to cruz ...
then we might find cruz .
i need you to put me in touch
with someone who brokers shelf corporations .
good . i need the fulcrum .
our ghost has a name -- vanessa cruz .
if i can find the person who brokered her --
agent keen , i &apos;m loathe to play &quot; tit for tat , &quot;
but unfortunately , due to present circumstances ,
i must insist on the fulcrum .
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s become
an immediate matter of life and death .
i know how much it means to you .
i don &apos;t think you do .
and you know how much it means to me
to know what part i play in all of this .
but you told me it &apos;s a blackmail file ,
and i &apos;m a federal agent .
i can &apos;t just hand over information to you
that might give you leverage over people who ,
for all i know , run our government .
those people launched a missile strike on the factory
to kill us in order to keep their secret a secret .
this is about tom , isn &apos;t it ?
no .
this is simply about me trying to survive .
i &apos;m perfectly happy to put you in touch with someone who deals in shelf corporations ,
but i need the fulcrum .
think about it , lizzy .
sorry , man . sorry .
yeah ?
it &apos;s me .
i need your help .
the case i &apos;m working on -- our perp funneled money
through a shelf corporation
called minnetonka bankers health &amp; life .
now , i &apos;m sure you must know
people who provide these types of services to people like --
to people like me ?
yes , to people like you .
isn &apos;t reddington your c.i. ?
why isn &apos;t he here ?
is he still upset about last night ?
i told you , if you help me with this case ,
i would get you those passports .
my relationship with reddington is not up for discussion .
what we need to talk about is the case .
now , these are two other shelf corps our unsub set up .
andrusia industries , middle leaf properties ...
are these supposed to mean something to me ?
all three of those shelf corps are named after minnesota lakes .
when i was sifting through your lies ,
i found the shelf corp where you had the money parked
berlin was paying you --
owasso inc , also a minnesota lake .
all right , i &apos;ll talk to my contact ,
see what i can come up with .
no , i &apos;ll talk to your contact .
how about we go together ?
what &apos;s so urgent ?
i wanted to talk to you about raymond reddington .
the vote &apos;s not until tomorrow afternoon .
the vote &apos;s all but taken -- not officially ,
but i &apos;ve spent the last six hours
speaking with all the major players .
you &apos;re back @-@ channeling ?
you &apos;re damn right .
if reddington has the fulcrum ,
his death triggers a protocol for release .
we will be exposed .
and why am i here ?
you &apos;re the swing vote , kenneth .
you &apos;re the one that will make this decision .
you know i lean towards the director .
why should i change that position now ?
because , mr. jasper , you strike me as a man
who would prefer to pitch rather than catch .
what the hell have you done ?
just ... hear him out .
that &apos;s all i ask .
roger is quite right .
the director &apos;s latest stratagem is hubris .
it has very little to do with me
and everything to do with the consolidation of his power .
if he succeeds ,
you &apos;ll become nothing more than his trusted servant .
he needs to go . he will go .
tomorrow , after the meeting ,
after you win this vote with everything
that your head and your heart tell you are true .
you &apos;re talking about assassination .
yes , mr. jasper .
ambition &apos;s debt must be paid .
&quot; julius caesar &quot; ?
one of my favorites --
the play , not so much the man .
the man was a bit full of himself .
he did have a brilliant military mind ,
but he couldn &apos;t smell a plot to save his life .
intentional pun .
and why is that ?
pride .
the subtlest and yet most deadly of the seven sins .
like the director , he couldn &apos;t be saved .
and which part do you play in all this ?
cassius ?
oh , no . i &apos;m the rubicon .
you simply need to determine
which side of history you want to end up on .
who are you , mr. jasper ?
a subordinate who remained slavishly obedient to his master ,
or the presumptive leader of an organization
that will be far more powerful than it has ever been ?
diamond drive properties .
oh , my god .
billy !
come here , you .
how you doing ?
ziggy , this is liz .
liz , this is ziggy .
what brings you two here ?
big favor . my friend here was a gull in a con game ,
and she lost a lot of money .
that &apos;s too bad , baby .
turns out , she was hustled by one of your clients .
you know better than this .
i know . i know . but i need an address .
look , the people we work for are serious ,
and if we don &apos;t get that money back ...
you his woman ?
i &apos;m more like his ... ball and chain .
yeah .
so , what do you say ? can you help us ? please ?
how about a thank you ?
ressler , i &apos;ve got a mailing address for cruz .
clear .
clear .
clear .
agent ressler ?
i &apos;ve got dozens of files , photos , dossiers .
i mean , she &apos;s going through their trash , hacking their networks .
i mean , listen to this .
copies of declan dalinger &apos;s bank statements ,
medical records .
there &apos;s even surveillance photos
and every book and video he &apos;s ordered for three years .
hang on . did you say dozens of files ?
this goes way beyond the names mr. reddington gave us .
i &apos;m looking at people she &apos;s framed ,
people she &apos;s thinking of framing .
aram , you wouldn &apos;t believe this place .
hair , threads , lint , bits of carpet , cigarette butts .
all collected , categorized , and filed
under each victim &apos;s name .
trace evidence to be planted at crime scenes .
drew roberts .
he was one of cruz &apos;s victims .
he worked at oakside investments .
and ?
that was the firm that employed cruz &apos;s dead husband .
aram , i might have an idea what this is all about .
you know , i &apos;m no worse than your buddy reddington .
he &apos;s not my buddy . and you are worse .
you don &apos;t get it .
even after all this time , reddington ...
is dangerous , and he is playing you .
i think he &apos;s more dangerous than you give him credit for .
but he has a moral code .
i don &apos;t like it , but at least i know what it is ,
and it does not include lying to me .
whatever you say .
you want to know what i &apos;m gonna do ?
no .
i &apos;m gonna buy a boat .
a boat ?
a diving boat .
gonna run it down to micronesia ,
open up a charter business .
you ever heard of chuuk lagoon ?
it &apos;s an old japanese naval base down in the south pacific .
february 7 , 1944,
sank 12 warships , 32 support vessels ,
and now they &apos;re just lying at the bottom of the ocean .
it &apos;s a diver &apos;s paradise .
you don &apos;t even know how to swim .
i know .
but i can learn .
sorry i &apos;m late .
i did it . i talked to an attorney .
about carlton ?
yes . and i think i have a case ,
that i should file a claim with h.r. for sexual harassment .
you did the right thing .
well , this only happened because you gave me the courage .
thank you .
we &apos;re gonna celebrate .
i &apos;ll book a room at the wolverton ,
and we &apos;re just gonna order room service
and watch movies all night .
i love you .
abby --
no . i mean it .
i know that we said
we weren &apos;t gonna get super serious ,
but i can &apos;t help it .
i love you .
what is it ?
i love you , too .
well , i &apos;m assuming you don &apos;t want me to walk you to your door .
thank you .
hey , can i ask you something ?
do you think it &apos;s possible ...
for someone like me
to start over ,
to become something else ?
isn &apos;t that what you do for a living ?
yeah .
but , you know what i mean .
can you be honest ?
you have to be honest .
tom .
our entire marriage , everything that happened --
our fights , the baby ...
your laugh .
it couldn &apos;t have all been pretend .
you &apos;re not that good an actor .
that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t ...
see it ,
because ...
so much of it was real .
you are my greatest failure as a profiler .
you &apos;re my greatest success .
you made me feel ... for a moment ...
like i had a life ... and that somebody cared .
so , this is me being honest .
can you be honest about the passports ?
the passports ?
they &apos;re real -- government issue .
where &apos;d you get them ?
berlin had a guy .
i guess not .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
i can &apos;t .
not about this .
that &apos;s not how the truth works .
you don &apos;t get to pick and choose .
not if you want to learn how to swim .
it &apos;s gonna be a nice boat .
what was that ?
that was goodbye .
that won &apos;t be necessary .
mr. hobbs here is one of the good guys .
how are faye and the boys ?
you know , i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve seen them since dylan &apos;s wedding .
they &apos;re fine .
mark and his wife just had a baby girl .
grandfather . well , it suits you well .
wisdom of the ages and all .
where is everybody ? i thought i was late .
the vote &apos;s already been taken .
roger .
roger , roger , roger .
i always treated you with respect .
we may not have seen eye to eye ,
but i always heard you out .
look , i don &apos;t know what he &apos;s been telling you --
i brought you in .
i know .
i was your sponsor .
yes .
look , i told him that reddington ...
reddington did not make you !
we made you !
have you forgotten what this organization has done for you ?
government contracts ?
silverstone ? r &amp; d grants ?
we put you in the game , and you betray us ?
you betray me ?
i treated you like family .
i supported you .
then just hear me out .
there is a car waiting for you outside .
you are going to the airport .
please .
you are leaving the country tonight .
you are not to call your family ,
and you are never coming back .
it &apos;s not about money .
it &apos;s about revenge .
aram , can you put up all the files ?
hernando cruz jumped off that bridge
after being accused of insider trading .
he purchased 10,000 shares of stock in rudman pharmaceuticals
one day before it got approval from the fda
to market a new cancer drug .
that stock doubled overnight .
toshiro osaka , our japanese entrepreneur
when hernando cruz made the trade ,
osaka was the cfo at rudman pharmaceuticals .
miles chapman -- he was the regulator who approved the drug .
and drew roberts was cruz &apos;s co @-@ worker
who oversaw all of the trades .
you think they were in on it with the husband ?
i &apos;m saying maybe the husband wasn &apos;t in on it at all .
maybe they set him up .
it makes sense .
vanessa cruz is a frame @-@ up artist .
maybe she got the idea from seeing how easy it was
for these people to frame her husband .
wait . the evidence you found in cruz &apos;s loft suggests
she &apos;s been targeting dozens of victims .
all one @-@ percenters
people who personify the same greed
that cost her husband his life .
assuming that she &apos;s going after everyone
who was involved in framing her husband ,
the question is , who &apos;s left ?
i don &apos;t know , but i do know someone who can tell us .
before you made your fortune in the private sector ,
you worked for the division of corporate finance at the s.e.c.
yeah , so ?
did you look at the research i gave you ?
tell us about hernando cruz .
did you find anything ?
hernando cruz .
he was a trader for oakside investments in 2008 .
he killed himself after you were about to open
an investigation into him for insider trading .
so ? what does that have to do with ...
i thought you were looking for the woman who set me up .
it was his wife who set you up , and now we know why --
along with toshiro osaka ,
miles chapman , and drew roberts .
tell us about hernando cruz .
he didn &apos;t jump off that bridge , did he , lester ?
don &apos;t look so depressed .
today &apos;s your lucky day . we found out who framed you .
cruz .
it was his wife ?
maybe we can help you .
maybe you can talk to us ,
and maybe we can make a deal .
it was 2007 , before the crash --
height of subprime mortgages , bundling ,
things that really hurt people .
but this ... it was a victimless crime .
we had every angle covered --
the trading floor , the regulatory agencies .
you made the s.e.c. look the other way .
i want a lawyer .
no , no , no .
what you want is a deal ,
and the only way you &apos;re gonna get that
is if you keep talking .
so ... talk .
everyone was going to look the other way ,
except that kid , cruz .
he found out , went to his boss .
we tried to keep him quiet , but he refused .
he was too idealistic .
so you were a part of a conspiracy ,
and when cruz tried to go against you ,
he was murdered -- thrown off a bridge
to keep him from blowing the whistle .
that &apos;s when you framed him ,
which is why she framed you .
when i knew her , she was nobody , a ranch hand .
how did she g--
if cruz went to his boss , like you said ,
why was it never reported ?
because his boss was in on it .
what was his name ?
mason carlton , thundridge capital .
cruz has taken revenge on everyone but this guy .
find him , aram .
房间号617
i called carlton &apos;s office , and nobody &apos;s picking up .
his cell is going straight to voicemail .
but get this -- i accessed his cell records ,
and i found a ton of inappropriate messages with his assistant .
her name is abby issa .
either this girl is having an affair with her boss ...
or he &apos;s being catfished .
you said she was his assistant ?
which means she &apos;d have the keys to the kingdom --
passwords , financials , credit cards .
there &apos;s a hit on mason carlton &apos;s amex .
he reserved a room for tonight at the wolverton hotel .
hello ?
abby ?
how long have you been here ?
hello , mr. carlton .
who the hell are you ?
hernando cruz .
surely you remember him --
the young day trader
you and your colleagues framed and murdered .
there were six of you ...
pigs .
too good to work ,
too refined and elegant to sweat .
so you and all the other useless , greedy pigs
instead gorge yourselves ,
grow fat on the sweat of the other 99 % .
so ...
little piggy ...
i will tell you how this is going to work .
you and abby have been having an affair .
there &apos;s a digital paper trail of texts and pictures .
your fingerprints and dna are in her apartment .
you reserved this room .
i &apos;ve arranged it so the police will believe
you &apos;ve been to her apartment ,
just like i &apos;ve arranged for them to believe
abby discovered you were embezzling from your firm
and was gonna blackmail you
unless ... you pay her to keep quiet .
they &apos;ll confirm she &apos;d gone to a lawyer ,
prepared a sexual @-@ harassment lawsuit ,
which she threatened you with ,
so you shot her
with the gun she bought to protect herself
before turning it on yourself .
abby ...
she has such a big heart .
she &apos;s so innocent , so ... unsuspecting ...
just like ...
but this is the only way .
you have to pay for what you did .
hey . i &apos;m here .
sorry i &apos;m late .
what is this ?
hello , this is security calling .
i have a gentleman and a lady from the fbi here
who &apos;d like to have a word with mr. carlton .
i &apos;m sorry , abby .
i &apos;m so sorry .
follow me , please .
hands where i can see them .
hands in the air !
she said she made a mistake .
she said she made a horrible mistake .
radio security ! have them lock down the hotel !
and call an ambulance !
ressler !
you wanted to see me ?
i thought you should know ...
mason carlton &apos;s gonna be charged
in the murder of hernando cruz .
we lost her .
yes . and we will find her .
what matters now is that the innocent people she framed
are gonna be set free .
this here ...
and you there ?
you have no idea how happy that makes me .
i wonder what his angle is .
sir ?
reddington . why give us this case ?
thank you .
what &apos;s his interest in this cruz woman ?
mrs. cruz , my employer is a longtime admirer of yours .
who are you ?
he understands your gambit has run its course .
the fbi knows what you &apos;re up to .
they &apos;re looking for you now ,
which means you have one of two choices --
run and hide , or accept his help .
what help ?
and who &apos;s this ... employer ?
i got your message .
what is this place ?
reddington .
tom , what are you still doing here ?
i &apos;ve been thinking about what you said ...
about needing to tell you the truth .
so i &apos;m gonna tell you the truth .
i don &apos;t understand .
the passports ...
the passports came from reddington .
liz , there &apos;s more .
it &apos;s me . it &apos;s done .
i &apos;m listening .
the vote went your way .
the director wasn &apos;t very happy , but a vote &apos;s a vote .
and hobbs ?
he wants to meet .
yes , i &apos;m quite sure he would have .
but he can &apos;t , can he ?
what are you talking about ?
hobbs was to contact me after the vote was cast .
he didn &apos;t , which means he &apos;s dead ,
which means you betrayed him -- betrayed me .
that &apos;s not true .
he specifically asked that the three of us should meet
so that we can discuss the future .
you need to run , jasper .
run like the prairie wind , because i &apos;m coming for you .
and when i find you ,
i &apos;m going to cut out that forked tongue of yours
and deliver it to the director myself .
it &apos;s time to go away , dembe .

who is a lifelong habitual , pathological liar .
