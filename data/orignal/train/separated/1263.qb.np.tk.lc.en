oh . oh , god . oh , oh , no !
oh , god . please .
you have to do it .
no , no !
i cannot believe i let you talk me into wearing heels ...
and buying a purse .
a convertible satchel .
maura , is there something you want to tell me ?
angela .
my mother &apos;s too old to have a baby .
i &apos;m a very young grandmother , though .
you don &apos;t have a grandchild .
i &apos;m throwing a little baby shower for lydia .
lydia ?
i hope it &apos;s okay .
no , that &apos;s not okay .
i &apos;m not asking you .
sure , yeah .
what ?
jane , come help me put this swing together .
and , you know , all your girlfriends who have children
gave me all their used baby stuff .
ma , lydia &apos;s a stranger , okay ?
she ran into your car .
the only thing you know about her
is that she &apos;s a bad driver .
she needs help . she &apos;s a sweet girl .
her mother should be doing this .
she was raised by a single mother , and she &apos;s just ...
not reliable .
why are you lowering your voice ?
what , is she in the guest house ?
where is she registered ?
&quot; where is she registered ? &quot; moochers &quot; r &quot; us .
angela ?
oh , no . she can &apos;t come in here now .
hello , lydia !
hi . i -- i was wondering if you could do --
wondering what ?
oh . sorry . i was just leaving .
hmm . jane rizzoli .
met you when you were passed out on maura &apos;s couch .
oh . right .
i remember you two .
hi .
is your gestational diabetes under control ?
i guess -- i mean ,
except when my sugars are high or low .
i mean , when they &apos;re out of whack , i get , like ,
moody and stuff , sweat and dizzy .
love to hear more . work .
rizzoli .
dr. isles .
all right , i &apos;m on my way .
yes , i &apos;ll be there as soon as i can .
that is so sad that people have to get murdered .
yes , it is .
well , off to work .
i &apos;m going to work , too .
yeah , lydia got a big job
at the penny saver discount bazaar .
yeah , i &apos;m , like , an assistant to , like ,
this cashier @-@ in @-@ training .
wow , like , this big . congrats .
come on .
you know , this business with lydia has got to stop .
then let &apos;s tell your mother .
oh , yeah , let &apos;s tell my mother
that the bun in lydia &apos;s oven
was either put there by my father or my brother , tommy .
jane , have you heard ?
no , what ? what &apos;s wrong with frankie ?
the victim was a friend of his .
what ? who ? who is it ?
it &apos;s shane .
shane finnegan ?
it &apos;s shane .
he &apos;s a leader of a pretty famous boy band --
the channel street boys .
frankie grew up with him .
oh , no .
how many times was he shot ?
shooter fired five times , hit him four times .
entry wounds in each thigh -- right shoulder and forehead .
fifth bullet was fired into the ground .
copper shrapnel embedded in the zygomatic arch and orbital margin .
copper shards are from the bullets &apos; casing .
what the hell was he doing down here in the combat zone ?
might have been down here to score drugs .
no way .
maura , the sores on his lips --
could those be from a crack pipe ?
i &apos;ll have to take tissue samples .
come on , frankie , he was using again .
he was clean . he went through rehab .
he wouldn &apos;t be the first to fall out of rehab .
okay , all right .
look , you should not be working this case .
oh , i have to .
then ... go search the perimeter , all right ?
go look for the gun . go on .
come on , bud . come on , i &apos;ll go with you .
poor frankie .
he &apos;s never lost anybody close to him before .
i think this could be cocaine hydrochloride in a freebase form .
somebody shot him four times over crack ?
first two shots came from there .
two shots to the legs -- shooter didn &apos;t want him running .
who does that belong to ?
registered to shane .
maybe he drove a crappy car down here so he wasn &apos;t recognized ?
yeah .
all right , let &apos;s get it back to headquarters ,
get it processed .
thanks .
god , what a shame . god .
i &apos;m so sorry , jane .
all right , uh ...
i got to go break it to his brothers
before they read about it on twitter ,
tell mom .
god -- she loved that kid .
shane , uh ... shane was a star .
channel street boys are never gonna ride like that again .
i &apos;m so sorry .
thanks , jane .
where were you after the concert ?
uh , doing a live webcast for the fans .
it was our last show before the world tour .
maybe you could show us .
yo ! yo , yo ! what up , southies !
so , shane -- he never showed up
to this live webcast ?
no .
we waited for him , but then we had to start .
it &apos;s time @-@ stamped .
this was right after the concert ?
yeah .
any idea why your brother never showed up ?
when he &apos;s using ,
that &apos;s all he can think about .
the band stops mattering .
we -- we stop mattering .
and then we find him
and peel him off some crackhead &apos;s floor .
you think somebody killed him over drugs ?
we &apos;ll know more
when we get the tox screen back .
when was the last time you saw your father ?
you know , it &apos;s been a while .
their father , ryan finnegan ,
was their manager .
yeah , that is a nice way of saying
that that abusive bastard made us sing for our supper .
stole all our money
until we were old enough to get him thrown in jail .
that ... was the last time we saw dad .
you think he had something to do with this ?
maybe .
okay . i &apos;m sorry , guys .
come here .
i &apos;m glad it &apos;s you doing this .
get whoever did this , okay , jane ?
i will .
i love that song .
sorry .
i &apos;d never heard of channel street boys before .
how &apos;s your mother ?
bawling .
i &apos;m so sorry .
yeah . me too .
well , what &apos;d you find ?
well , he has a very pretty face .
teen idols often have these symmetrical features
and , um , distinguished brow .
yeah , he was even prettier in life .
he was so sweet and soulful .
there are fibers embedded in the shrapnel wounds .
maybe from the hoodie ?
i have to run some tests .
run some tests , right . okay .
his father made him the meal ticket of the family .
they went from a cold @-@ water
flat to stardom .
just like that .
did frankie and shane stay friends ?
no .
i mean , frankie would , you know ,
see him whenever the band played in boston ,
but i think frankie knew shane
was into drugs , so ...
hmm , probably a dopamine dysfunction .
it &apos;s associated with substance @-@ related disorders ,
particularly with people who become celebrities as children or teenagers .
i thought fame was the drug .
tox screen results are back .
thanks .
hmm .
what &apos;s the &quot; hmm &quot; for ?
shane didn &apos;t have any drugs in his system .
well , that &apos;s probably why he was down there buying more crack .
no , i had susie take hair samples .
he hasn &apos;t had drugs in his system for at least six months .
well , that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
then what was he doing down there ?
oh , ma .
why isn &apos;t frankie back yet ?
he &apos;s still at the crime scene looking for the gun .
well , at least he has something to do .
yeah .
why , honey ?
why would someone kill shane ?
we don &apos;t know , ma .
you know , his brothers told me that you were the girl
in their song , &quot; pure boston beauty . &quot;
what ? me ?
yeah .
yeah , well , shane had the biggest crush on you .
he was like my little brother .
you told him once he could sing , remember ?
yeah .
frankie and him wanted to start a band .
good thing frankie kept his day job .
anything ?
i got to go . they just brought shane &apos;s car in .
hey , will you come to lydia &apos;s shower ?
oh , come on , ma ! that &apos;s so not fair .
life &apos;s short . please .
she needs the influence of strong women .
i don &apos;t know ...
it would make me so happy if you came .
you know , i &apos;m gonna text her and tell her that you &apos;re coming .
what ? no , ma !
excuse me .
can we get some help ?
one sec .
could you just finish this text to lydia ?
i &apos;m not seeing any blood .
we will
if we don &apos;t talk to lydia .
well , how are we going to get her alone ?
we &apos;re meeting her at the dirty robber in two hours .
what do you mean &quot; we &quot; ?
i sent her a text from ma &apos;s phone ,
and she thinks ma &apos;s gonna be there .
you did what ? !
i can &apos;t be a part of this .
oh , you are so a part of this . where is she registered ?
i was trying to be polite .
okay , well , you be &quot; polite &quot; cop , and i &apos;ll be
&quot; i &apos;ll beat your face in if you tell my mother
you slept with her husband and her son &quot; cop .
okay ?
found something .
that &apos;s shane &apos;s backstage pass .
found his car keys , too .
that &apos;s weird .
well ... frost , pop the trunk .
ooh , nice piece of luggage .
now , why would he leave his cellphone ?
whose body was found in an area known for drug transactions .
sources say the troubled singer ,
who shot to stardom with his brothers ,
struggled with addiction to crack cocaine ...
poor shane . he can &apos;t even die in peace .
... even after a long stay in a rehab center --
all five shell casings came from the same weapon .
would be nice to find that gun .
any luck tracking down their father ?
nope .
ryan finnegan did his time , did his probation .
last address was a halfway house --
no credit cards , no driver &apos;s license , nothing .
oh , hey , look . here comes inspector gadget .
what are you doing ?
he &apos;s opening a radioshack .
i &apos;m working on shane &apos;s cellphone .
you found shane &apos;s last text message .
yeah , but it was to an unregistered pay @-@ as @-@ you @-@ go phone .
so , what does it say ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
this phone &apos;s really sophisticated .
it &apos;s a 3 @-@ d block array with non @-@ pattern rotation .
why does a boy @-@ band star need military @-@ spec security ?
wow . i &apos;m impressed .
i read ...
tom clancy novels .
tom does his research .
well , with the tabloids hacking into celebrity cellphones
these days , it makes sense .
so , push your decrypter button , inspector .
here goes ...
yes .
that doesn &apos;t look good .
that did not just happen .
maybe if i back @-@ fish the instruction set .
maybe you should have backed it up
before you started playing with it .
shane embedded a self @-@ destruct worm in the phone &apos;s base code .
that doesn &apos;t sound good .
the phone &apos;s programmed to wipe out its memory
if anyone attempts to access it .
but you can retrieve shane &apos;s last text , right ?
no .
no , it &apos;s gone ... forever .
come on , maura , think .
there &apos;s got to be a way to get those texts back .
i told you -- there isn &apos;t .
would you like some quinoa , kale , and yam ?
sure , when i &apos;m a contestant on &quot; survivor . &quot;
oh , thank goodness .
look , frankie brought us some mad dog 20 / 20
to go with our yams .
i found it .
you found the gun !
yeah .
it was in a storm drain a block and a half north .
it &apos;s only like a mile and a half , so i thought i &apos;d just run .
frankie , this is huge .
yeah .
oh , you know , you &apos;re -- you &apos;re sweating all over maura &apos;s stuff .
oh , sorry .
all right ,
take that straight to the crime lab ,
okay , and fill out the paperwork .
okay .
nice job .
yeah .
that &apos;s great .
oh , my -- oh , crap . come on .
&quot; come on &quot; where ?
we -- we got to go face the lydia music .
oh , come on -- you know , i don &apos;t like confrontations .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re the good cop .
oh , right , and you &apos;re the &quot; beat your face in &quot; cop .
correct .
look at that -- punctual , too .
pregnancy brain -- a woman &apos;s brain @-@ cell volume
decreases in the third trimester .
well , lydia can &apos;t really afford to lose any more brain cells .
you know what the scariest part is
about lydia and my father ?
imagining them having sex ?
no !
trying to figure out what it is he saw in her .
well , studies show that many men
prefer to date less intelligent women .
but why ?
well , you and i have our own lives , big jobs .
you know , we don &apos;t make men our priority ,
but women like lydia do .
i ran out of gas on sudbury street .
what , you walked ?
uh @-@ huh . can i sit down ? oh , my feet are killing me .
right here .
okay .
so , where &apos;s your mom ?
drink some water .
dehydration isn &apos;t good for pregnant women .
okay .
neither is being a slut .
oh , i don &apos;t like ice -- too cold .
yes ... ice is cold .
uh , lydia , listen --
okay , the reason that we wanted to talk to you --
i don &apos;t know .
we haven &apos;t told you yet .
i don &apos;t know who the father is .
i mean , is that why you wanted to talk to me ?
but it &apos;s either your father &apos;s baby or tommy &apos;s , so ...
oh , my god .
i ... thought you knew .
you thought i knew ?
well , jane , you did know .
i did not know . i do not know ...
how do you not know ?
well , me and tommy were just having fun , hanging out
and then he introduced me to frank
and , i mean , frank was so nice --
okay , can you just please get to the part
where you know which one ... did that .
well , that &apos;s just it ...
i -- i don &apos;t know .
of course you don &apos;t .
i have to come clean with angela .
no !
no !
she &apos;s the nicest , best mother ever .
that &apos;s why i wanted to bump into her .
what , you meant to rear @-@ end her car ?
oh , no , that part was just an accident .
but frank said --
please stop calling him &quot; frank . &quot;
well , your dad said
go back to &quot; frank . &quot;
um , well , he said that angela was the best mom .
i want to learn from her .
learn what ? frank left her .
he left me , too ...
... when i told him i was pregnant .
here you go . here you go .
thank you .
well , i should go .
i have to get lamaze .
wait , you can &apos;t go to birthing classes by yourself .
i &apos;m gonna drive you .
okay , well , have fun .
breath deep , in and out , all right . okay . bye @-@ bye .
jane .
what ? !
oh , no , maura . i am not going .
to distract your partner from pain ,
talk about one of the best moments of your lives together .
so , lydia , what do you like to do ?
oh , you mean , like , hobbies ?
well , i don &apos;t really have any .
take your mind to a beautiful and peaceful place .
well , where do you like to go ?
the beach ? the mountains ?
the mall !
i like the one in wrentham -- no sales tax .
fine . um , let &apos;s pretend you &apos;re in wrentham .
what am i doing ?
lydia , um , have you thought about , you know , getting --
getting some tests done to figure out who the father is ?
no , it &apos;s not important .
uh , i mean , i think it &apos;s good to know .
i don &apos;t .
visualize that happy place .
cool . i &apos;m at the mall .
i &apos;m in hotdog haven .
i love their outfits .
yes .
yes , the bright colorful ones with the hats ,
like &quot; cat in the hat . &quot; that &apos;s cute .
maura .
and now a contraction begins .
sit behind your partner and massage her back .
you know , um , after the baby is born ,
you could -- you could have a paternity test .
no .
i want to do a water birth .
okay , listen to me .
i don &apos;t want you telling my mother what you did .
it could really hurt her , all right ?
um , can you massage me just a little bit lower ?
but i don &apos;t feel it &apos;s right not to tell her .
what , now you got a conscience
after you slept with half my family ?
lydia . think .
no , lydia , don &apos;t strain yourself .
i don &apos;t want my mother to know about this , all right ?
okay .
okay , i won &apos;t tell her .
did you sleep here ?
i didn &apos;t sleep .
what are you hiding ?
you can see when jane gets here .
look what i found in my closet .
shane even signed it .
guess what i found .
shane &apos;s last text .
you found it &apos; cause you lost it .
shut up .
i thought the phone &apos;s memory was destroyed .
it was ,
but they had cameras shooting the entire concert .
i went through all the footage .
shane &apos;s last text ...
frost , you &apos;re a genius .
a genius wouldn &apos;t have killed the phone in the first place .
are you ever gonna let me live this down ?
hell , no .
okay .
if i enhance the image ...
&quot; i &apos;m free . let &apos;s do it . &quot;
it sounds like a booty call .
texting for booty ?
technology is killing romance .
well , if you learned how to text ,
you might have a little more luck with your booty calls .
i can show you how .
all shane would have found in the combat zone is prostitutes .
i guess it &apos;s possible ...
unless he didn &apos;t want to be recognized .
maybe he was meeting someone in one of those motels down there .
they &apos;re pretty sleazy .
half @-@ day rates for druggies and working girls .
maura &apos;s got something .
come on , frost .
jane may be onto something .
let &apos;s go shake down some motel managers --
see what falls out .
there are no prints on the weapon ,
but there was a minute concentration of dried blood
on the upper @-@ back area of the grip .
wow . okay , so it &apos;s amateur hour .
meaning ?
uh , it &apos;s a classic newbie injury .
i saw it a couple times at the academy .
if you use an improper grip ,
the slide will slice that flap of skin
right between your thumb and your trigger finger .
the interdigital webbing .
we used to call it a &quot; wenis . &quot;
i like that -- wenis .
hard to forget since it rhymes with pe--
maura .
oh , thank you , senior criminalist chang .
we &apos;ll take it from here .
so , can you run the dna panels
on the &quot; wenis blood &quot; as fast as possible , doctor ?
frost .
jane , do you know if shane knew anyone named jamie rellis ?
jamie rellis ?
yeah , that &apos;s a character in &quot; friends with benefits . &quot;
why are you talking about romantic comedies
with detective frost ?
must be a pseudonym .
someone checked herself into the hancock street motel
right before shane &apos;s concert ,
hasn &apos;t been out of the room since .
we &apos;re about to go in .
how long has that sign been up ?
i don &apos;t know .
open the door .
i shouldn &apos;t be doing this , you
now .
there &apos;s someone on the bed .
miss ?
clear .
better get dr. isles down here .
this one &apos;s not coming back .
it &apos;s gia lemond .
what , the famous pop singer ?
she can &apos;t be that famous . i &apos;ve never heard of her .
her upper and lower lip have second @-@ degree burns .
from a crack pipe -- looks like an overdose .
well , let &apos;s not leap to conclusions , sergeant .
yes , sergeant , please , stop the leaping .
i &apos;m looking at some online gossip sites .
gia and shane knew each other
same rehab program .
i think i know
why gia offed herself with a crack pipe .
again , we don &apos;t know
if this is an overdose or a suicide .
what ? gia and shane were lovers ?
dr. isles , you just leapt to a conclusion .
i did not .
&quot; gia and shane were lovers ? &quot; -- question mark .
i &apos;ll go round up the security footage from outside the motel .
you probably need some help .
oh , come on .
you guys aren &apos;t afraid of a little female towel @-@ snapping , are you ?
oh , yes , we are .
maybe gia and shane were crack buddies , you know ?
that would explain what shane was doing in the combat zone .
hey , got something
that &apos;s t.k. &quot; the killer &quot; womack and his posse .
right outside the motel where we found gia .
down the street from where shane was murdered .
t.k. is a music manager .
he managed both gia and shane &apos;s band .
what if gia and shane were meeting at the motel
to smoke crack ?
t.k. follows them -- after all ,
he can &apos;t make any money
if his stars are crackheads .
yeah . -look at this --
t.k. goes in the motel at 12 : 15,
and he comes out at 12 : 30 .
let &apos;s bring him in ,
check his dna against the blood on the gun slide .
let me know when you got him .
where you going ?
i got to stop a snitch from squealing .
i hope jane comes .
that &apos;s her favorite food .
hmm , she likes bacon chocolate ?
yeah . i hope we get to play some baby @-@ shower games .
well , how many people are coming ?
you , uh , me , lydia , and jane -- i hope .
so , four total . - mm @-@ hmm .
jane .
hello .
look who i found .
ah , you have no idea how much i needed to
welcome this baby into the world right now .
honey , what &apos;s the matter ?
my baby won &apos;t have a daddy .
oh , you &apos;re better off without that creep .
he dumped you because you &apos;re pregnant .
he dumped me when i told him the baby might be tommy &apos;s .
what ?
tommy ? tommy who ?
uh ... tommy rizzoli .
you &apos;re carrying tommy &apos;s baby ?
oh , no .
uh , ma ...
frank dumped me .
frank rizzoli ?
frank rizzoli , my husband ?
oh , god . ma ...
did you know ? - just let me explain --
explain what ?
that you lied to me ?
we simply avoided referencing a specific set of facts .
you knew , too ?
that was my husband .
he was the father of my children ,
and you come into my house , into my family ,
and you ask me for my help after all you &apos;ve done ?
i &apos;m sorry .
ma , listen .
ma , please .
ma , listen to me , okay ?
dad did a terrible thing , okay ?
i just -- i didn &apos;t know how to tell you .
i didn &apos;t know how to tell you . i &apos;m sorry .
i was , uh , mrs. rizzoli for 35 years .
i ... i was frank &apos;s wife , and ...
and now ... i &apos;m not anybody anymore .
no , come on .
don &apos;t touch me !
ma , please . ma , please !
is this where your mother lives ?
yeah .
great . let &apos;s get your stuff out of the car .
i &apos;m sorry if i caused any trouble .
if you caused any trouble ?
i had no idea how roomy this cargo area is ,
did you , jane ?
yeah , the backseat &apos;s really comfortable , too .
oh , good .
yeah , fantastic . where do you want all these gifts ?
do you have the baby &apos;s room set up ?
i want to know if there &apos;s indoor plumbing .
is that you , lydia ?
yeah . hi , mom .
what are you doing here ?
i rented out your room .
can i have it back ?
you &apos;re gonna have to share it with jed .
okay .
who &apos;s jed ?
no wonder she preferred my mother .
oh , jane .
oh , what , maura ?
what , huh ? what are you gonna do ?
you &apos;re gonna go share your room with lydia and jed ,
dump on my mother some more ?
no , lydia &apos;s made her grown @-@ up choices .
and i got to go . frost and korsak are talking to a suspect .
oh ! don &apos;t throw it !
okay , i got it . i got it , i got it .
know anything about this ?
i had business with gia .
we talked , i left ,
and the bitch must have killed herself .
you were her manager .
and how &apos;d you feel about her smoking crack ?
it was pretty stupid , but it was her life .
look at her .
must have bugged you to see shane go in to smoke with gia .
he &apos;d been clean . what &apos;d you do ?
shoot him in the legs so you could talk to him ?
blast one next to his head ?
make him plead for his life ?
no , man . shane was my boy .
he was worth a whole hell of a lot more to me alive than dead .
check it -- i want my lawyers now .
how many do you have ?
a gang .
hey , yo , i ain &apos;t staying in here .
just make yourself at home
until your gang of lawyers gets here .
shane was one hell of a philanthropist .
he donated to a lot of children &apos;s charities
and relief agencies .
well , told you he was a good guy .
really good guy ,
especially because he didn &apos;t have much money .
what ? no , no , no , the band made millions .
they were broke . i &apos;m looking at their financials .
thanks to good old dad .
and then t.k. stepped in .
no wonder shane started smoking crack again .
t.k. was just as bad as their father .
well , no . no , they got lucky .
there was one little clause in their new contract .
they kept &quot; merchandising rights ,
online fan memberships , and premium chats . &quot;
hmm , that &apos;s where all the money is now .
so , they were about to get rich ,
t.k. was about to be left behind .
is this mr. t.k. &quot; the killer &quot; a caucasian man ?
no . why ?
because these are the dna results ,
and the blood on the gun slide belongs to a white male .
so that means ryan finnegan still looks good for this .
motive could be revenge -- the boys put him behind bars .
then why not go after all three of them ?
shane was that band .
ryan put all the pressure on him ,
but how the hell we gonna find him ?
oh , even if he was on skid row somewhere ,
he has to collect social security .
i tried that . he listed a p.o. box .
yeah , but there &apos;s a cellphone number .
the billing address is the same p.o. box .
well , maybe you can call mr. finnegan
and ask him to come down to the police station .
oh , good idea , maura .
&quot; hello , mr. finnegan .
we think you murdered your son .
can you just come on down here and tell us how you did it ? &quot;
does it make you feel better to mock me ?
kind of .
sorry .
i &apos;m frustrated .
it &apos;s okay .
we could stake out his p.o. box .
what , for two weeks ?
that &apos;s when he gets his next social security check .
wait a minute . i got an idea .
hello , mr. finnegan ?
that was my idea .
not this part .
yes , i &apos;m calling from bric insurance .
uh , we need to verify a receipt of
a large check we sent to you .
your ... your son , shane , named you as a beneficiary
on a large life @-@ insurance policy that we issued .
ryan finnegan ?
yes .
hello , mr. finnegan .
jane ?
jane rizzoli ?
what are you doing here ?
arresting you for murder .
i &apos;m telling you , i didn &apos;t kill my son .
i love my boys .
you love the money they made .
and then , one day , they grew up ,
and , suddenly , it was a fair fight .
and i &apos;ll bet you didn &apos;t like that .
we &apos;re gonna do a cheek swab so we can compare your dna
to blood found on the murder weapon .
go ahead .
i didn &apos;t kill shane .
i wouldn &apos;t kill my boy .
well , then , let &apos;s hope it &apos;s not your blood on that gun .
jane , you know me .
yeah , i sure do .
how &apos;s she doing ?
not good .
take it before she comes back from the bathroom .
don &apos;t tell her that you knew about lydia .
you can &apos;t take all the heat .
yes , i can .
just take care of her , all right ?
hey , you &apos;re a really good person .
no , i &apos;m not . i lied to her , frankie .
you were trying to protect her .
you should have seen her face .
janie ...
did mr. finnegan do it ?
i don &apos;t know , but ...
frankie , where &apos;d you go ?
hey , ma .
hi , jane .
hey , maura .
hey , frankie .
we suck , maura .
i know .
uh , listen , i know what those lesions were
on shane &apos;s lips and mouth .
well , thank god i &apos;d already lost my appetite .
he was taking proguanil and chloroquine .
they &apos;re anti @-@ malarial medications .
what , he was headed to a mosquito @-@ infested area ?
that doesn &apos;t make any sense . they were off to europe .
&quot; i &apos;m free . &quot; unless ...
gia .
maura , can you check to see
if gia had the same drugs in her system ,
and then meet me upstairs ?
yeah .
shane and gia were booked on a flight to port @-@ au @-@ prince .
they were together .
shane was texting gia ,
&quot; i &apos;m free . let &apos;s do it . &quot;
he was quitting the band . they were running away together .
gia was taking the anti @-@ malarial medication , too .
&apos;cause they were going to haiti ,
probably to do concerts
or raise money for relief efforts .
uh , gia &apos;s hair sample results ..
she &apos;d been drug free for at least six months .
well , they met in rehab .
she probably o.d.
when she heard that shane had been murdered .
the blood comparison tests came back , too .
the blood in the gun slide isn &apos;t ryan finnegan &apos;s .
but ?
i found variable tandem repeats in the dna test .
the blood on the gun is similar .
but has a different mitochondrial dna .
so it &apos;s a familial match ?
that means it &apos;s one of his brothers .
but they were doing a live webcast when he was shot .
well , the theoretical risk of a coincidental match
is 1 in 100 billion .
there are seven billion people on this planet .
our shooter is one of shane &apos;s brothers .
ronan and liam were streaming a live webcast .
it could &apos;t in two places at the same time .
not unless they &apos;re electrons ,
as max planck &apos;s quantum theory proves .
they used a cheap program
called streamblast pro to do their webcast .
everything looks correct ,
but look at the auto @-@ update in the default setting .
yeah , it &apos;s an old version of streamblast pro .
that &apos;s not possible .
streamblast pro automatically updates ,
and it updated the program three days ago .
it &apos;s possible ,
if this live webcast was shot two weeks ago .
yeah , but why would one of the brothers want to kill him ?
shane was quitting the band .
a week after mca died ,
the beastie boys &apos; sales went up 949 % .
t.k. said shane was worth more alive than dead ,
but not to his brothers .
the fiber in shane &apos;s shrapnel wounds is denim .
frost , can you show me
what ronan and liam were wearing
in their final concert ?
only ronan &apos;s wearing jeans .
took a good shot to shoot shane twice in the legs
from 20 feet away .
jane .
yeah .
ronan has a hunting license .
okay , so , if ronan can shoot , why the wenis ?
that &apos;s right , because you said only amateurs get a --
a wenis .
yeah , i did . i think i know what happened .
i got to take frankie . he needs to see this through .
* maybe someday i &apos;ll tell you *
* when i &apos;m a star in the band , yeah . *
* this song is about you . *
* and you &apos;ll - *
sorry , guys .
any news ?
let &apos;s take five .
yeah , we got some news .
we &apos;re rehearsing to shoot a tribute to shane .
it &apos;ll mean so much to the fans .
oh , it &apos;ll mean a lot to you , too .
yeah , 25 bucks a pop times a few millions fans .
it should more than make up for the canceled tour .
you said you had news ?
yeah , you two made a pact to kill shane , didn &apos;t you ?
what are you talking about ?
you shot him first , ronan .
take it !
what ? no .
and you fired into the ground
because you couldn &apos;t bring yourself to shoot him .
oh , god , please !
but you had ronan there , to encourage you .
do it !
but you &apos;d never fired a gun before ,
so the slide cut your hand .
oh , god .
the shot that killed him came from you .
that was pretty cold to shoot your little brother in the head .
those are your favorite jeans , right ?
i mean , they &apos;re tiny , little holes --
you probably wouldn &apos;t notice .
what are you talking about ?
when liam fired into the ground ,
shrapnel from the bullet went through those jeans
and embedded the fibers into shane &apos;s face .
now put your damn hands behind your back !
you , too . come on !
come on . let &apos;s go .
do you have anything that has fat in it ?
i have some yummy honey @-@ smoked tempeh bacon in there .
no , i want something that &apos;ll clog my arteries .
what are you doing here ?
she wants me to help her move , jane .
what ?
i &apos;m gonna go move in with my cousin , theresa .
angela , please don &apos;t .
i knew about lydia , too , ma .
i know .
you and jane always shared everything , and i --
i understand that you were all trying to protect me , but --
ma , i &apos;m so sorry .
but can you understand
that i can &apos;t have my children think i &apos;m pitiful .
ma , dad is the one who &apos;s pitiful .
you didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
we did . dad did . okay ?
we -- we all admire you . don &apos;t you understand that ?
admire me ?
for what ? i -- i lost my marriage , i lost my house .
i live in your best friend &apos;s guest house .
i @-@ i work in a cafe ?
i admire you because you picked yourself up
when you could have just laid on the floor .
no , i admire you for the person that you &apos;ve always been .
you &apos;re optimistic and warm and loving and strong .
ma , you &apos;re still strong .
okay , you &apos;re an example to all of us .
hey . hey , hey . she &apos;s right .
okay ?
i always wanted a mother like you .
oh , maura .
you &apos;re great kids , you know that ?
oh , ma .
because of you , ma -- because of you .
i never really liked theresa .
she doesn &apos;t clean her bathrooms .
i love you so much .
all right .
okay , the group hugging -- i can &apos;t do it .
