methinks the lady doth protest too much .
listen , renaissance fair ,
why don &apos;t you be a good wench and clean up your counter ?
until the cupcake business takes off ,
i &apos;m just gonna have to find a temp job online .
can i close this window that says &quot; mexican painkillers &quot; ?
yeah , yeah , but , uh , bookmark it first .
here we are . craigslist . okay .
how does this job sound ?
disgusting and depraved .
you didn &apos;t even hear it yet .
did i not hear &quot; craigslist &quot; ?
oh . here &apos;s something easy i could do .
a professional organizer .
you &apos;re not a professional organizer .
you &apos;re barely a professional waitress .
i am a genius at organizing things
and getting them out of the way .
i recently lost all my money and the promise of a bright future ,
and i &apos;ve organized that into a file in my head
labeled &quot; do not open until you are stronger . &quot;
if i can handle that for myself ,
i can certainly handle a stranger &apos;s light filing .
if i had known all that craziness was going on in your head ,
i would have ordered you some mexican pain killers .
or the peruvian . they &apos;re stronger ,
but sometimes they make you lose control of your hands .
thought that was an ibuprofen .
what is johnny doing here at 3 : 00 a.m. ?
thought it was a rapist or something .
rapists don &apos;t knock and wave .
and if they looked like that , we wouldn &apos;t call them rapists .
we &apos;d call them ...
johnny !
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m here to talk to you guys
about the church of latter day saints .
and i have to pee . can i use your bathroom ?
no problem . don &apos;t forget to tip the bathroom attendant .
what &apos;s up , caroline ?
just trying to find a day job
where i won &apos;t get handcuffed to a radiator .
on craigslist ?
this is so romantic .
jumping over the back wall
to drop down and see you in the middle of the night ?
it &apos;s very romeo and juliet .
it is very romeo and juliet .
he has to pee , and i &apos;m the nearest toilet .
please . that &apos;s just an excuse .
the man defaces buildings .
and what ? he draws the line at peeing on them ?
he came by here to see you .
pull your hair back . it &apos;s kind of in your face .
pull yourself back . you &apos;re kind of in my face .
thanks , guys .
i was tagging a building nearby ,
and while i was on the roof
i saw that your light was on ,
so i thought i &apos;d stop in and say hey .
hey .
so , johnny ,
you just saw our light on from the roof nearby ?
interesting .
do you always look down when you &apos;re up that high ?
not really .
interesting .
flying solo tonight . my lookout guy went into rehab .
it &apos;s kind of a pain .
it &apos;s really a two @-@ person operation .
ugh , such a bummer when people can &apos;t handle their heroin .
hey , max , what are you doing tomorrow night after work ?
any desire to be my lookout guy ?
i might have some desire to be your lookout guy ,
but as far as the &quot; guy &quot; part of &quot; lookout guy &quot; goes ,
full disclosure ...
what , you don &apos;t have a penis ?
oh , i have one .
in a drawer in my bedroom .
if the cops come tomorrow ,
i will run like a girl .
okay . so pick you up at the diner at 2 : 00 ?
cool .
cool .
cool .
and then romeo left . so romantic .
all the weeks of flirting and game playing
have finally led to this-
you two on a late @-@ night roof rendezvous .
hey , genius organizer ,
why don &apos;t you put all that garbage in a file labeled
出演过爱情烂片 《 一夜大肚 》 《 27套礼服 》 《 丑陋的真相 》
&quot; i &apos;ve seen too many katherine heigl movies &quot; ?
i &apos;m just saying , he likes you .
he likes you with his penis .
there . 3f .
all right . you &apos;re here .
goodbye . go organize .
no , i said you have to wait until i open the door
and check out if it &apos;s safe .
it &apos;s my day off . you &apos;re the one with the job .
and you &apos;re the one who freaked me out so much
about going into a stranger &apos;s apartment .
what did i say that was so bad ?
you told me he &apos;d cut off my face
and wear it as a party hat .
i said ... &quot; probably . &quot;
probably cut off your face .
nothing bad is gonna happen to you , okay ?
okay .
it &apos;s a safe @-@ enough looking building , right ?
yes .
look , they have those hallway trash chutes .
that &apos;s probably how he &apos;ll get rid of your faceless body !
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m fine . go .
caroline &apos;s second job . so proud .
call me if you freak out or anything .
how am i gonna call you without a face ?
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m not gonna call you .
hello , it &apos;s caroline , the professional organizer .
hello ? someone called for an organizer ?
hello ?
oh , no . oh , hell no .
max , come back !
hurry up . this is so exciting !
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m not going back in there .
he &apos;s a hoarder . a hoarder .
it &apos;s a bad reality show .
hey , that is a great reality show .
but it &apos;s not good reality reality .
the only thing i love more than hoarders
are people who are too fat to fit through doors .
tell me the hoarder has to grease his sides to get through the door .
you won &apos;t have to get me a birthday present .
are you kidding me ?
are you kidding me ?
they should charge admission for this .
it &apos;s hoarders 3d - the experience .
it &apos;s like going to an imax .
it &apos;s my max !
save yourself . go on without me .
oh , god .
what is that pile over there ?
it &apos;s hard to tell what is what .
it &apos;s either an old shag carpet
or a mass grave of dead muppets .
no way . let &apos;s get out of here .
we still have our faces . why would we leave ?
and besides , you need this money .
look around .
there might be stuff here they don &apos;t want
that we can sell on ebay .
look . you know someone &apos;s gonna
want a fish tank full of doll heads .
yeah , someone with a fish tank full of doll bodies .
last year i owned a yacht named the caroliner ,
and now i &apos;m considering selling doll heads on ebay .
i &apos;ll be organizing that thought in a file in my head
labeled &quot; don &apos;t open ever . &quot;
okay .
there &apos;s a heavy clown presence in this room .
it &apos;s unsettling , and i &apos;m obsessed with it .
i want both more and less of the clowns .
um , hello ? anyone here ?
oh , hey , i &apos;m over here .
i &apos;m sorry . where ?
by the papers .
which papers ?
the papers near the papers .
oh , my god . i love this !
um , hi . caroline ? we spoke yesterday .
there &apos;s a lot more to organize here
than you led me to believe on the phone ,
so we &apos;re gonna have to renegotiate our price .
it &apos;s not that bad .
not that bad ?
i was hired to organized some papers ,
not clean up katrina .
what &apos;s he look like ?
please tell me he needs to be buried in a piano box .
i don &apos;t know . i can &apos;t see him through the truck .
it &apos;s an rv , and it &apos;s a collectible .
it &apos;s where i keep my raisins .
so how much more , then ?
um , a hundred a day . for both of us .
and we get to keep the horse head made out of soda cans .
why would we want that ?
we don &apos;t . it &apos;s for chestnut .
every horse wants a friend made out of cans .
you got a deal .
okay . we &apos;ll get to work then .
okay . let &apos;s not get overwhelmed .
we &apos;ll take it one step at a time .
let &apos;s start small .
happy birthday to me .
whoo , max . well , look at you .
starting the night at the end of the night .
this is the first time i &apos;ve seen you
out of the prison uniform .
you look beautiful .
oh , earl , let &apos;s get married .
what are you staring at ? it &apos;s just clothes .
max , you look like a lady .
tonight when i dream of having sex with you , as always ,
this time i will ask you to stay .
max , you look perfect for your date .
it &apos;s not a date .
it is .
no , it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s booty call .
there is a fresh , white billboard .
i &apos;m climbing it with my friend , and we &apos;re putting up his artwork .
booty call on billboard .
if it &apos;s after 2 : 30,
call is for the dirty .
what &apos;s that from ?
引用原书 《 你想去的地方 》
dr. seuss &apos; &quot; oh , the places you &apos;ll put it in &quot; ?
okay , boys , break it up .
go about your business . nothing to see .
max .
max and johnny &apos;s first date . so proud .
it &apos;s not a date .
be home at 11 : 00 ...
a.m.
uh , max , you got protection ?
no , i &apos;ve got it .
me too .
no , sorry .
that is pack of gum .
can we take these masks off now ?
whoo . it is hot up in that bunny .
are we wearing these
so no one &apos;ll be able to pick us out of a lineup ?
yeah , that .
and i always wanted to see a rat with big boobs .
well , here he is .
all right . now for the most crucial part of the art process ,
beer break .
that makes sense .
been here four minutes .
gentleman .
look over there . you can see manhattan .
oh , yeah .
she &apos;s a bitch .
always shoving her stuff in your face .
you can never have it .
yeah .
i &apos;d never want to live in manhattan .
&apos;cause you can &apos;t afford it ?
yeah .
she is beautiful , though .
yeah , she is .
well , we should get back to work .
bunny &apos;s gotta hop .
how many more times do you need to hear it ?
he didn &apos;t kiss me .
maybe it wasn &apos;t the right time .
overlooking the new york skyline ,
a hundred feet in the air , bathed in moonlight ?
yeah , that &apos;s a crappy time .
maybe he didn &apos;t want to make a move
because he doesn &apos;t know you like him .
i leaned in . i leaned for a kiss .
maybe you had a breath situation .
what did you eat ? what had you eaten ?
nothing .
okay , but sometimes when you don &apos;t eat , it &apos;s worse ,
because you start to grind up your feelings .
then you get stomach breath .
i wouldn &apos;t kiss ryan gosling with stomach breath .
yes , you would .
yes , i would .
i &apos;m finally making progress on the papers .
美国第32位总统 死于1945年
oh , no , fdr died of polio .
oh , look . they cured polio .
jackpot . this place is a freakin &apos; cat factory .
and they &apos;re alive . how refreshing .
there &apos;s , like , 45 kittens in this box ,
and i think one of these kittens just had kittens .
kittens having kittens .
hey , douglas , we found some kittens .
those are not my kittens .
okay . what about this mountain of butterfinger wrappers ?
those are my wrappers .
i need those .
i haven &apos;t even seen him yet . i love this show .
douglas , if you &apos;re comfortable with me
selling all this sort @-@ of @-@ valuable stuff on ebay ,
why do you need to keep a box full of butterfinger wrappers ?
i don &apos;t want to think about it !
see , max ?
this is what happens when you don &apos;t deal with your feelings .
you start collecting butterfinger wrappers ,
and next thing you know you &apos;re an old lady in a rest home ,
and you &apos;re thinking &quot; why didn &apos;t he kiss me ? &quot;
why didn &apos;t he kiss me ?
i don &apos;t know .
why didn &apos;t you kiss him ?
you obviously like him , right ?
max , stop hoarding your feelings .
just admit that you like him .
i like him .
okay , good .
there &apos;s one box of butterfinger wrappers gone .
what ?
douglas , it &apos;s a metaphor .
so next time you see him , why don &apos;t you just kiss him ?
i don &apos;t know if i can kiss him first .
just kiss him already !
wait , there &apos;s another person in here ?
butt out , mother .
those are my kittens , young lady .
hold up . he &apos;s hoarding another hoarder in here ?
awesome .
i can &apos;t believe you put
the platypus foot rest in the trash .
on ebay we could get at least three to six dollars for it .
i &apos;m gonna tell you this one more time .
it &apos;s a possum , and it died at least three to six years ago .
oh , my god . there &apos;s johnny .
this is a katherine heigl movie .
what are you guys doing in this neighborhood ?
oh , hello . sorry to interrupt you ,
but what the hell &apos;s going on here ?
this is , uh ...
i &apos;m cashandra , his girlfriend .
who are you ?
i &apos;m max , and , um , that &apos;s how i say hi to everyone .
i &apos;m incredibly friendly .
she &apos;s so friendly .
here &apos;s table ten , earl .
are you okay , max ?
rumor has it that you had your heart broken .
i didn &apos;t have my heart broken .
and that &apos;s why i don &apos;t listen to rumors .
max , i want to announce i have ended my bromance
with your boyfriend , johnny .
i hate the player as well as the game .
never was my boyfriend .
i would like to offer myself for rebound sex .
or , if not , i can just beat the crap out of him .
caroline , did you have to tell everyone ?
i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m not keeping that up in my head .
i &apos;m not going butterfingers .
i can &apos;t believe he has a girlfriend .
are you happy now ?
you got me to admit that i like him ,
and then you got me to kiss him .
and then i kissed his beautiful girlfriend ,
who is black and british ,
the two cool things i can never be .
i &apos;m sorry , but he led you on .
oh , did he ?
i think you and douglas &apos; mother led me on .
this is not my fault .
he &apos;s the one who &apos;s hoarding women .
hi .
yeah , you must be to come back in here .
can we talk ?
pick up , max .
table three , table nine .
table 69 .
not a good time .
max , look ...
johnny , stop .
you don &apos;t need to &quot; max , look &quot; me .
it &apos;s cool . you never led me on .
you never put your hands on me .
you never even kissed me .
food !
hey , better make sure he doesn &apos;t have a girlfriend
who &apos;s beautiful , black , and british .
max , look , i wanted to kiss you .
i want to kiss you .
i just didn &apos;t want to be the guy who did it
when he &apos;s with someone else .
look , max , i didn &apos;t know you were gonna come into my life .
i didn &apos;t know i was gonna have these feelings for you ,
but all of a sudden it &apos;s &quot; max &quot; all the time in my head .
cassandra and i have or @-@ or had something ,
and there is or was love there ,
and @-@ and i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m supposed to do
with all my feelings for you .
johnny , i just spent two days
wading through someone else &apos;s garbage ,
and quite frankly , i don &apos;t have the time or the energy
to go through all the clowns and candy wrappers you &apos;ve got
going on up in there .
and the next time you invite someone
to a booty call on a billboard ...
it wasn &apos;t a booty call .
i think everyone knows
if it &apos;s after 2 : 30 , the call is for the dirty .
and p.s. , we &apos;ve known each other six months ,
and you never told me you had a girlfriend .
you should have worn the rat mask .
and that &apos;s all she wrote .
silver lining time ?
we didn &apos;t have to change
douglas and his mother &apos;s diapers ?
we made $ 240 for the cupcake business
selling all that crap on ebay .
yup . i made some money , and all i lost was my mind .
want to hear something you don &apos;t want to hear ?
i think what johnny said to you was beautiful .
you think a squirrel holding an acorn is beautiful .
he didn &apos;t touch you or kiss you
because he didn &apos;t want to start a relationship
with you out of a lie .
you know what ? you &apos;re right .
you &apos;ve been right all along .
it is like romeo and juliet .
and now i &apos;m gonna go home and kill myself .
i don &apos;t think romance is in the cards for me .
i give guys blue balls , not broken hearts .
oh , my god . don &apos;t kill yourself yet , juliet .
i definitely think romance is in your cards .
that &apos;s not me .
that &apos;s not his girlfriend .
come on , will you at least admit that that &apos;s you
and that he put it up there because he wanted you to see it ?
and that &apos;s actually incredibly romantic .
oh , yeah . that &apos;s the most romantic picture
of a guy who might be kissing someone
who might look like me ,
but he didn &apos;t because he has a hot british girlfriend
who seems like kind of a bitch ,
but is kind of cooler than i will ever be .
i dare you to organize that thought .
there &apos;s no one cooler than you .
you &apos;re 200 feet tall .
yeah , and a bird just took a crap on me .
come on .
come on .
