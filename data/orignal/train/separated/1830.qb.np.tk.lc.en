the best gift i ever got
was for christmas when i was 10 ...
my very first suture kit .
i used it until my fingers bled ,
and then i tried to use it to stitch up my fingers .
thank you for meeting me .
you &apos;re the chief of surgery . if you page , i &apos;m here .
it put me on the path to becoming a surgeon .
i want to say something .
i need to say something ...
about what happened the other night .
i @-@ i need you to know it wasn &apos;t ...
well , it isn &apos;t what you think .
oh . i don &apos;t think anything
about your personal life , sir .
i had a problem ... a long time ago .
i was diagnosed with alcoholism .
or i diagnosed myself .
and i didn &apos;t take a drink for almost 20 years .
but i think it was a misdiagnosis .
i &apos;m not saying my drinking wasn &apos;t bad , because it was .
but there is such a thing as ...
situational depression .
and i think that &apos;s what i was suffering from ,
and it escalated my drinking .
situational depression ?
your mother .
yes .
well , she escalated my drinking , too , so ...
have you told anyone what you saw ?
i mean , have you told derek ?
no .
no .
well ... since i took a step back from surgery ,
i &apos;ve had some time to really look at our residents .
and your work ...
your raw talent ... is extraordinary .
a lot like your mother &apos;s .
and since i have some time ..
some extra time ...
maybe you would like a mentor .
maybe i could teach you some things .
have you ever done a 2 @-@ layered , continuous suture for an anastomosis ?
my point is , sometimes the best gifts
come in really surprising packages .
no .
take a seat .
you &apos;re about to .
wait .
oh , it &apos;s teddy . ah , i love it when it &apos;s teddy .
okay .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s strange that he &apos;s mentor
and still not talking to me ?
since the merger , it is impossible to get o.r.time.
and who is responsible for that
that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying . i need all the help i can get .
and i am saying , he is using you to get to me .
he is not .
then why now ? why are you suddenly seeing so much of him ?
i &apos;m done talking about this .
if you want to stay mad , stay mad .
but i &apos;m just gonna be here kissing you .
oh , my god .
that is the biggest pseudoaneurysm i &apos;ve ever seen .
it &apos;s at the suture of the transplant ,
the new heart is dying . damn it .
poor guy that brought her in
i think they were on their third date .
it doesn &apos;t even look like a heart anymore .
that &apos;s because it is not .
it &apos;s a chunk of useless flesh that has to come out right now .
are you taking the heart out ?
what are you gonna replace it with ?
i don &apos;t know . we &apos;re gonna have to figure it out as we go .
节日病
okay , wait . let me get this straight .
you removed her heart ?
yes .
a @-@ and she can live that way ?
like--like what , like a @-@ a vampire ?
usually you &apos;d connect a ventricular assist device to the heart ,
but since she doesn &apos;t have a heart ...
dr. altman attached two , um , devices to her blood vessels .
now this machine now pumps the blood through her body ,
which is basically , um , a miracle .
i really like her . uh , i like her a lot .
but we &apos;ve only had four dates .
i &apos;m supposed to have thanksgiving
with my family , you know ?
she was gonna join us .
and now she &apos;s like a ...
she can really live without a heart ?
if you don &apos;t want to stay , we have a great nursing staff ,
great doctors .
she &apos;ll be in good hands .
no . you know , she doesn &apos;t even have a family .
and if it was me , i would want somebody here .
so ... i &apos;ll stay .
okay .
tucker and little tuck are both fine .
yeah , i know .
i &apos;m sorry i have to work today and on christmas this year .
yeah . uh , tucker and i were hoping to bring him home
to visit you .
mom , um , i have to go .
happy thanksgiving , mom .
you didn &apos;t tell your parents about the divorce ?
how long can you keep that a secret ?
when you started dating women ,
how long did you keep that secret from your family ?
okay .
when did the bleeding start ?
this morning . he &apos;s had this before .
i just ... i &apos;ve never seen a nosebleed go on like this .
there &apos;s blood on timmy , mom .
mr. and mrs. jacobsen , can i see you ?
go ahead . we &apos;ll be fine .
nicholas has what is called an arteriovenous malformation .
it &apos;s a cluster of tangled blood vessels in his brain .
it &apos;s what &apos;s causing the bleeding .
in order to stop the bleeding ,
y @-@ y @-@ you mean like brain surgery or ...
i &apos;ll do everything i can to protect the brain tissue
and minimize damage .
i &apos;m sorry . i know it &apos;s scary .
but we have to go in right away .
excuse me .
i &apos;m looking for dr. mark sloan .
um , you see the dude who was burned ...
trying to deep fry a turkey ?
sloan &apos;s the guy making him scream like a girl .
no !
dr. sloan ?
hi .
um , so this is a little weird ,
but , um ... my name is sloan reilly .
and , uh , my mom &apos;s samantha reilly .
pretty sure you &apos;re my dad .
how &apos;s it , uh , how &apos;s it going in here ?
great .
fine .
okay .
so have we broached the question of a paternity test ?
&apos;cause i brought supplies .
she &apos;s 18 .
that &apos;s not very much younger than me .
well , it &apos;s not that shocking actually .
i mean , the way mark got around before he met you ,
there could be a gaggle of sloans .
sloan jones . sloan smith . sloan sloan .
mean .
ah , damn it .
son of a bitch .
i can &apos;t access the feeders .
so ... what does that mean ?
it means i can &apos;t get at it .
i can do a temporary fix ,
but once he starts bleeding again , which he will ,
there won &apos;t be anything we can do .
so we &apos;re just gonna ...
send him home to die ?
happy thanksgiving , jacobsen family .
nice day .
little chilly .
yeah .
it &apos;s brisk , though . it &apos;s not cold .
right .
look , teddy ...
no . i ... i know .
i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t understand .
you--you said that--that he would die without the surgery .
and now you &apos;re telling us we &apos;re
supposed to just take him home ?
right . well , i &apos;ve stopped the bleeding temporarily .
but the only way to remove the a.v.m. safely
is through the sinus .
well , why don &apos;t you do that ?
because there are no instruments
that can maneuver through a nasal cavity this small
and get the appropriate angles .
why not ?
who does that ? who invents those things
mark ...
now might be the good place for you to say something
out loud .
dude , are you , like , high or something ?
sloan .
yeah .
yes ?
mark , i need you on something .
i have a daughter , derek .
an 18 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
i am too young to have an 18 year old .
it &apos;s a nail in my coffin .
it &apos;s like death has come to call .
ok . can we put in your existential crisis for a minute ?
no . that &apos;s why they &apos;re called the crisis
look , dr. robbins and i have a 6 year old
with an inoperable a.v.m.
we need your help to make it operable .
this is the best thanksgiving ever .
no obnoxious relatives .
no stupid traditions .
no going around the table and saying
what you &apos;re grateful for . yeah
i think we should the opposite
talk about what we &apos;re not grateful for .
the merger .
the mercy westers .
they &apos;re like the plague .
i mean , stealing all of our surgeries
eating all that pie in the nurses &apos; station .
you &apos;re doing that wrong .
i am not .
you are . can i show you ?
private lessons with the chief ...
man , those daddy issues are working for you .
i don &apos;t have daddy issues . he is teaching me
you &apos;re his bitch .
well , in that case , you &apos;re teddy &apos;s bitch .
maybe that &apos;s my problem .
i &apos;m nobody &apos;s bitch .
oh , well , you were izzie &apos;s bitch .
you &apos;re the bitch .
you know what ? it &apos;s thanksgiving . well ...
can we just have no name @-@ calling ?
yeah . please .
whatever . just show me that stitch again .
welcome
happy thanksgiving . i want wine
i do
no , you don &apos;t ...
hey , everybody
well , the results are in
it turns out sloan was right about her parentage
i am her dad
so here &apos;s another thing to be thankful for
lexie ?
sloan here is ...
gonna move in with us for a little while
oh , my god
now just--just ease up .
let the suture do the work for you .
you know , it &apos;s like a dance .
you know , you let the needle be the man ,
let it take the lead ,
and let your hand just follow .
look at that . i haven &apos;t seen skill like that since ...
since your mother .
that woman ... she could dance .
you should make up with derek .
it &apos;s christmas . it &apos;s time .
you need to take perpendicular bites
about a millimeter apart .
how &apos;s it feel ?
still tingling ?
oh , it &apos;s fine .
i pretty much have full sensation .
great . good .
so ...
have you , uh ...
i mean , uh , you think you could ask her
how long she &apos;s planning to stay ?
mark , it &apos;s been a month ,
and you &apos;ve exchanged three sentences with her .
two of them were , &quot; pass the cereal . &quot;
in the spirit of the holiday ,
maybe you can ask her yourself .
she &apos;s pretty easy to like once you get to know her .
really ?
no . she &apos;s a vapid , vapid girl ,
but she &apos;s your daughter , okay ? so--so try .
okay ? try--try to be her dad .
go .
what are you looking at , you old perv ?
dad !
merry christmas .
mm. uh ...
uh , your mother sent me .
uh @-@ oh . you heard .
your cousin said something
to her husband in front of your niece ,
who said something to your younger niece ,
who said something to your mother .
i @-@ i was planning to put a tree up , i just ...
where is tucker
he &apos;s back east with tucker &apos;s family .
he was with me for thanksgiving .
so it &apos;s true .
you are getting a divorce .
it &apos;s weird .
no heartbeat .
i used to climb mountains , you know ?
one time i did the inca trail .
it &apos;s four mountains in three days .
the second day there &apos;s this climb .
it &apos;s eight hours straight .
and you are so tired ,
and the air is so thin , you don &apos;t even talk .
all you do is climb .
and it &apos;s just you and your breathing
and your heartbeat pounding in your ears .
it &apos;s just hard getting used to no heartbeat .
and i &apos;m getting tired .
really tired .
i know .
you know what ? you just need to hang on till new year &apos;s eve .
there &apos;s a lot of drunk drivers , a lot of brain death .
it &apos;s an organ @-@ palooza .
kelsey , you just gotta hang on , okay ?
you &apos;ll hike again , you know ?
we &apos;ll hike together .
it &apos;s such a beautiful world outside of this hospital .
it &apos;s snowy and quiet ... cold ...
and perfect .
so , you know , you just gotta make it until new year &apos;s eve .
i need to go outside .
what ?
what ?
i might die. we all know that .
i might die really soon .
but snow is my favorite thing in the whole wide world .
it &apos;s my favorite thing .
please .
please , okay ?
i &apos;m sorry , but
we can do that .
we can do that .
i want to bolt. i want to quit .
i want to ... go back to new york
or i don &apos;t know arkansas
somewhere no one can come looking for me .
i don &apos;t know how to talk to her. i ...
and i don &apos;t know what she wants from me .
it &apos;s the guilt , you know ?
it &apos;s like every time i look at her , it just ...
the guilt is like a punch in the gut every day .
well , you shouldn &apos;t feel guilty. you didn &apos;t know .
i did know .
i knew when her mom got pregnant .
she told me .
i gave her a couple hundred bucks
and i left town , and i never saw her again .
you know , i figured she got an abortion. hoped .
but i did know .
well , you &apos;re a different guy now .
you &apos;re not 18 anymore. you &apos;ve grown @-@ up .
you &apos;re capable of better .
nicholas is back in the e.r. he &apos;s got a nosebleed , bad .
i &apos;ve been trying to stop it for an hour .
we can &apos;t operate .
all right , well , then i &apos;ll admit him and keep transfusing
until the equipment &apos;s done , which is gonna be soon , i hope ?
um , hello . are you bailey &apos;s--
or i mean , miranda &apos;s dad ?
william bailey. uh , you can call me bill .
okay. hi , bill .
i &apos;m callie torres. i &apos;m a @-@ a friend of bailey &apos;s .
she mentioned that she snuck you in here .
said i should come say hi. so
what &apos;s that she &apos;s doing on there
oh , that &apos;s a hernia repair .
we get a lot of hernias at christmas .
lots of people lifting trees or heavy gifts
or santa bags .
it &apos;s--oh , we get a lot of broken bones , too ,
&apos;cause of the weather .
oh , i had this , uh , this guy earlier .
he got an electric shock from some christmas lights .
the shock was so big that it broke both of his wrists .
yeah. anyway , i &apos;m dating women and--
uh , i &apos;m sorry ?
oh , i &apos;m , uh ... i &apos;ve recently started dating women .
and my family had a really hard time accepting that ,
but , you know , we worked through it .
bailey said that you &apos;re having a hard time with her divorce ,
which i totally understand .
but i ... i j
i wanted to say that
she didn &apos;t come to that decision lightly .
and she &apos;s a good person , and ...
merry christmas .
did hunt ever tell you about the time
that he made snow ?
no .
his guys were feeling the holidays pretty bad ,
so hunt orders one of those snow makers on christmas eve .
he tries to get the thing going ,
but the minute that the snow hit the sand , it melts .
so hunt blindfolded his guys
and made them put their faces right up to the snowblower .
there was this one kid from minnesota .
he actually cried .
he said it felt exactly like christmas at home .
ooh , hunt .
hunt &apos;s so delicious when he &apos;s tending to bloody soldiers .
love me some hunt .
shut up .
so how was the view ?
i have been a proud father .
your whole life , i have been a proud father .
your mother and i sat in the front row
of every dance class , every oboe recital ,
and we cheered .
we sat in the front row of every graduation .
i was always the first one on my feet
and the loudest one in the crowd .
i have been ... a proud father .
and today , miranda , i @-@ i s @-@ sat in the gallery ,
and i watched you repair some fat man &apos;s hernia .
and for the first time in my life ,
i felt ashamed of you .
this is what you do on christmas ?
for this , you traded your husband ?
for this , you traded your child &apos;s family ?
so you could work all day
and go home alone on christmas
to an empty house without even a tree .
i have been a proud father ...
miranda .
but i would be a bad father today
if i didn &apos;t look you in the eye
and tell you that you have made a terrible mistake .
you broke your family .
you set your son up to fail .
and the child i raised ...
huh , she was raised better than that .
well , that &apos;s something you don &apos;t see every day .
she could cold . the monitor could short out .
teddy &apos;s a brilliant surgeon ,
but i @-@ i don &apos;t get how she made this call .
i get it . it &apos;s patient care .
and teddy &apos;s always been a sucker for christmas .
oh , my god . kelsey !
from your x @-@ rays and c.t. ,
it looks like part of your bowel has died .
it--it &apos;s a side effect of your poor circulation .
it &apos;s why you collapsed .
but just ... fix her , okay ?
she can &apos;t have come this far to ...
just fix her .
we &apos;re gonna need to repair this as soon as possible .
the more time we wait , the more bowel dies .
yeah , but how ?
she &apos;s septic , hypotensive , and she has no heart .
her pressure &apos;s too low for general anesthesia .
she won &apos;t survive .
then ... we won &apos;t put her under general .
and this goes through the nose to the base of the skull ,
and then i drill the bone off .
well , what happens once you drill the holes ?
we put mini staple clips on the vessels .
with what instrument ?
we don &apos;t have it. not yet .
but we will. we will .
we &apos;re , uh , still trying to figure out how to build it ,
but we &apos;re on it .
uh ... i would like
an invitation to your home for christmas dinner .
i know it &apos;s very late for me to be asking for such an invitation ,
given that it is , in fact , christmas day .
however , i have a very worried father ,
and if i don &apos;t look like i have some sort of life ,
he &apos;ll never leave .
i have a bowel infarction to repair , and then after that ,
i &apos;ll be free to come to your home .
sounds fine .
oh , absolutely .
thank you .
the chief just cut off the funding for our equipment .
what ?
what ?
we &apos;re way over budget ,
and nicholas is running out of time .
we want our bonuses to go towardssorry
part of time for nicholas and jacobsen .
sorry , you can &apos;t do that .
no , but it &apos;ll be like a donation .
they &apos;re our bonuses .
there are no bonuses . that &apos;s what he &apos;s trying to say .
there are no bonuses this year . i &apos;m sorry .
merry christmas .
i &apos;ll write a check . how much ?
i &apos;ll split it with you .
thank you .
i have a teenager . what if she wants to go to college ?
have you met her ?
fine , i &apos;m in .
thank you . i &apos;ll get back to you with numbers .
uh , shep .
chief .
i &apos;m sorry i tried to fire you .
and in the spirit of the holidays , i was , uh ...
sorry .
i really can &apos;t stay
but , baby , it &apos;s cold outside
i &apos;ve got to go &apos; way
but , baby , it &apos;s cold outside
this evening has been
been
so very nice
hopin &apos; you would drop in
i &apos;ll hold your hands
they &apos;re like ice
my mother will start to worry
hey , beautiful , what &apos;s your hurry ?
my father will be pacing the floor
listen to the fire roar
so really , i &apos;d better scurry
well , maybe just a half a drink more ...
you &apos;re not serious . you got him a snow globe of seattle ?
what ? he likes seattle .
i gave you 50 bucks . where &apos;s my change ?
mark ... your kids are bickering .
have you talked to her yet ?
i &apos;m workin &apos; on it .
your sister &apos;s got a ready @-@ made family there .
well , don &apos;t worry . she didn &apos;t forget about you .
she invited you , right ?
he &apos;s drinking ... isn &apos;t he ?
richard .
he &apos;s off the wagon .
well , he &apos;s drinking eggnog. it &apos;s christmas .
everybody drinks eggnog at christmas .
mm , some people do . recovering alcoholics don &apos;t .
he &apos;s not an alcoholic .
that was a misdiagnosis .
is that what he &apos;s telling you ?
meredith , he is a surgeon and he is drinking ,
and he is an alcoholic .
that could quickly become catastrophic .
were you drinking when i was a kid ,
when you left me with my mother and got another family
and never looked back ?
no .
no , i didn &apos;t start drinking till much later .
well , then we can &apos;t blame the world &apos;s evils
on alcohol , can we ?
oh , yeah .
it hurts .
i know .
surgery with only a local anesthetic is not ideal .
hang in there .
mm. okay , okay .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
i &apos;m here with you , all right ?
hey , hey. hey , no tears . no tears at christmas .
no , there &apos;s only , uh ,
lights and , um , snowmen ...
and songs .
oh , the weather outside is frightful
but the fire is so delightful . come on now .
but since we &apos;ve no place to go
karev .
no , thanks .
sing , yang .
oh , no . i don &apos;t-- um , i &apos;m jewish .
hey , don &apos;t play the race card with me .
sing or get off my service .
let it snow , let it snow , let it snow
it doesn &apos;t show signs of stopping
and i &apos;ve brought some corn for popping
you , too , karev .
the lights are turned way down low
let it snow , let it snow , let it snow
the house looks beautiful , mer .
thank you .
callie ?
working .
oh , that &apos;s too bad .
here , you want some stuffing ?
thanks .
that &apos;s all , thank you .
oh , how-- how &apos;d kelsey do ?
uh , well .
who &apos;s kelsey ?
a girl with no heart .
i had to do a laparoscopic bowel repair
while the poor thing was awake on the table .
miranda , mind your manners .
even if surgery is your whole life , it doesn &apos;t mean
you have to talk about bowels at the dinner table .
my child is healthy .
excuse me ?
he may not be with me tonight , but he &apos;s healthy ...
i didn &apos;t say he--
and he &apos;s well @-@ loved .
he &apos;s a well @-@ loved boy . and he &apos;s a happy boy .
and staying in an unhappy marriage--
now is not the time or the place--
staying in an unhappy marriage ,
a marriage that i &apos;ve outgrown ,
a marriage full of ultimatums and numbness and resentment--
miranda
that is not the kind of life
i want to model for my child .
that is not what i want him to believe
married love is .
look , i know what &apos;s possible .
i know what &apos;s out there for me
because you taught me well .
you and mom showed me what true love looks like .
so i chose not to settle , and i &apos;m happier for it ,
even if i &apos;m alone at christmas .
my child is healthy , and i &apos;m happy .
and , you know , part of my happiness is
the fact that i got to repair a woman &apos;s bowel
and save her life today .
and that &apos;s god &apos;s work ,
which makes this appropriate christmas dinner conversation .
i &apos;m happy .
and my child is healthy .
and that &apos;s enough for me today , dad .
that &apos;s enough .
uh , green beans , anyone ?
thank you .
thanks .
okay . here i would advise a one @-@ hand tie .
um , okay. uh , why don &apos;t i talk and you operate ?
good .
last night was my last drink .
the shaking will stop soon .
good. good for you .
that doesn &apos;t mean i have to quit drinking tequila , does it ?
&apos;cause i really like tequila .
it &apos;s new year &apos;s eve .
i know .
she shows no signs of leaving--
no suitcase packed , nothing .
talk to her right now , or no more sex for you .
so ... what you reading ?
i can tell you don &apos;t really like me ,
and , um , your girlfriend &apos;s , like , totally freaked out by me
&apos;cause i &apos;m kinda , like , hotter than her .
but i &apos;m pregnant . yeah .
i &apos;m having a baby , and , um ,
that &apos;s why i dropped out of school
and that &apos;s why my mom kicked me out .
look ... i know you don &apos;t owe me anything ...
but i can tell you guys are about to kick me out ...
and i ... i ...
i don &apos;t have anywhere else to go .
it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re gonna be okay .
he &apos;s in hypovolemic shock . he &apos;s lost too much blood .
and i didn &apos;t want to have to do this , but we &apos;re gonna
have to put a tube down his throat to help him breathe .
nicholas
we need to tube him right now .
don &apos;t tube him .
bag him till we get to the o.r. ?
the o.r. ?
we finished the instruments .
we did ?
yeah , we &apos;re gonna operate .
i just need you to sign a consent form .
pretty dramatic timing , dr. shepherd .
i like to make an entrance .
it &apos;s okay .
her kidneys are shutting down .
we need to find a donor . we needed to find one yesterday .
it &apos;s new year &apos;s eve , dr. yang .
you said i just had to make it to new year &apos;s eve .
drunks all over the roads . so yeah .
tonight &apos;s are best shot .
oh , how &apos;s it handling ?
it could bend a little more gently .
don &apos;t get all critical . the thing cost me a fortune .
i could use one more day to practice . okay .
inserting the clip applier .
why don &apos;t you try torquing it a little
to get a different angle ?
there you go .
okay . there it is .
okay .
got it . that &apos;s the last clip .
oh , my god !
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re done here .
nice work. beautiful .
oh , my god. you did it .
amazing .
hang on . look at the clock .
and that &apos;s , uh , seven , six ...
five , four ...
three , two , one .
happy new year !
happy new year .
happy new year . happy new year .
i &apos;m just gonna take a listen .
it looks like we &apos;re hitting the final wave .
i need to talk to you .
yeah , well , i &apos;m headed to the - what is wrong with you ? - you .
me ?
yeah , you. you come over here ...
why did you tell me this now ?
why do you even care ?
you didn &apos;t say a thing , all those times , all those years
so why now ?
i don &apos;t know .
you don &apos;t know ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know .
what does it matter to you ? you never felt the same way for me .
of course i did !
of course i did .
i had all those feelings for you , teddy , for years ,
but you never gave me anything .
you were engaged .
you were e ..
you never gave me one damn hint ! you idiot .
i have loved you forever .
i have loved you when i was coupled up .
i have loved you when i was single .
i have loved you every second of every day .
teddy ...
i love you . i &apos;m in love with you .
i &apos;m in love with cristina .
you paged me ?
uh , i just confirmed , uh , brain death
on an 18 @-@ year @-@ old female
involved in a head @-@ on m.v.c. earlier this evening .
she &apos;s a match for kelsey .
so i called n.o.s.
and they gave me the go @-@ ahead for a directed donation .
now dr. bailey will do the organ recovery
and i set up all two for kelsey .
that is why new year &apos;s eve is my favorite holiday .
stop it .
this is not a celebration . come here .
no .
no , no , no , not my baby .
please not my daughter. oh , my ... i can &apos;t ...
this is not a celebration .
no , no , no , you can &apos;t ...
oh , no .
your kidney &apos;s have stabilized ,
and your vitals are stable , and ...
everything looks great .
feel .
awesome , huh ?
um , i can only really feel your boob , so ...
you want to feel ?
uh , no. but i will listen .
oh , my god. what are you doing ?
oh , my god. what are you doing ?
i know it &apos;s only been a couple of months .
and four dates . it &apos;s technically been four dates .
you amaze me ... every day .
and we went through a war together .
we went through this together , and we came out the otherside .
and i think ...
if we can get through this , we can get through anything .
so marry me. please .
yes . of course .
i &apos;m ...
insensitive sometimes .
but i &apos;m not oblivious .
and i don &apos;t want you to , uh , to be with me
because you feel like you owe me something because ...
i mean , you two went through war to ..
i with you .
i &apos;m with you because i want to be .
i &apos;m with you because i love you .
are you sure ?
every day , we get to give the gift of life .
it can painful , it can be terrifying ...
but in the end , it &apos;s worth it ...
every time .
we all have the opportunity to give .
maybe the gifts are not as dramatic
as what happens in the operating room .
uh ... so how was new year &apos;s eve at tucker &apos;s ?
oh , it was fine .
i kissed my grandson at midnight east coast time ,
and i tucked him into bed .
okay. uh , so you &apos;re headed home today ?
mom &apos;s picking you up at the airport ?
yeah .
i , uh ...
tucked you in every night of your childhood .
爸
i tucked you in and i kissed you goodnight .
and i checked under the bed for bad guys .
and you went and grew up and got yourself a divorce ...
and didn &apos;t bother to tell me .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t know how to ... explain .
i didn &apos;t want to disappoint you .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t want to be judged .
i &apos;m your father .
can you imagine if little tuck grew up and got a divorce
and didn &apos;t tell you ?
then i &apos;m sorry , dad .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m so sorry .
maybe the gift is to try and make a simple apology .
i &apos;m ... never judging you .
i &apos;m worrying about you .
your mother and i worry about you .
that &apos;s all .
little tuck ,
he &apos;s a real spitfire , isn &apos;t he ?
he is .
he sure is .
he doesn &apos;t seem too much worse for wear .
maybe it &apos;s to understand another person &apos;s point of view .
hi. i &apos;m sorry that i paged you .
he &apos;s pretty public here ,
and i know what that could do , you know , to his career .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t know what else to do .
maybe it &apos;s to hold a secret for a friend .
the joy , supposedly , is in the giving .
meredith .
happy new year .
she is my star pupil , joe .
my little star .
and i &apos;m so proud of her .
i am very proud .
she will be a brilliant surgeon ...
brilliant ...
just like her mother .
so when the joy is gone ...
get dr. drey a drink , joe. tequila .
when the giving starts to feel more like a burden ...
that &apos;s when you stop .
and , um ... i will-- i &apos;ll have another club soda .
but if you &apos;re like most people i know ...
and it &apos;s on me--on me .
you give till it hurts ...
and then you give some more .
