watching tv-- cool .

where do you think you &apos;re going ?
that charger belongs to all of us .
nowhere .
oh , really ?
because it looks like you &apos;re going
to your room to charge
when it &apos;s not your turn .
you know the rules , dumb @-@ dumb .
charger stays in a neutral room .
why do we only have one charger anyway ?
it was supposed to bring us closer together .
hey , look , another charger .

they are such idiots .
i don &apos;t know why i do this .
the charger doesn &apos;t even fit on my phone .
i have , like , six chargers in my room .
i just do this for fun .
it &apos;s funny .
well , here we are by ourselves .
what should we do ?
uh , definitely not make out .
definitely not .
your hand &apos;s on my boob .
yeah .
and it &apos;s weird .
maybe it &apos;s less weird because i know
that it &apos;s weird-- i &apos;m calling it out .
doesn &apos;t make it less weird .
right on .
so you &apos;re an upper @-@ boob guy .
that &apos;s the most underrated part of the boob .

can i ask you a question ?
please .
what &apos;s going on here ?
yeah .
what are we ... ?
we , us ?
what are we doing ? yeah .
we are roommates ,
who have made out a couple of times ,
and are attracted to each other .
and really good friends .
yeah .
and sometimes
genuinely kind of hate each other .
and sometimes ...
touch each other &apos;s boobs .
little bit better ...
not helping .
little bit worse ?
yeah .
第二季 第二十一集
would you describe this as a sexual act ?
i would describe that as the pledge of allegiance ,
which can be sexual . why ?
because this is what i got from nick .
just out of the blue .
no reason .
our relationship &apos;s so confusing .
but this is nick we &apos;re talking about .
he &apos;s never gonna tell me how he feels .
it &apos;s always gonna be weird .
and i have to stop expecting for it to ...
change . what ?
you realize your hand is still on your boob , right ?
i can &apos;t explain it , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s , like , really calming me down .
i mean , the sexual tension has been off the charts .
it &apos;s like the wild west .
no laws .
whiskey for a nickel .
whores caked in mud .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
you &apos;re always there when i need you , tran .
thank you .
i &apos;m glad you got no life .
i &apos;m joking . would you settle down ?
my father just died .
i don &apos;t know , life &apos;s short , huh ?
it just kind of ...
i got to start doing things , tran .
making moves , grown @-@ up moves .
i don &apos;t know , i want things .
i want to , like , mow a lawn ,
you know , my lawn , in dark socks .
what &apos;s my move with jess ?
what would you do ?
of course you would , you dirty dog .
well , in reality , tran ,
what would do if you were me ?
a date ?
what if that &apos;s not what she wants ?
what if she ... oh !
what if she ... ?
all right , you &apos;re right-- no second @-@ guessing .
i got to be confident , i &apos;ve got to be clear .
women like that .
all right , i just got to say ...
jessica ,
you are a beautiful woman ,
and my life has not been the same since i met you .
and it would mean the world to me
if you would , uh ...
go on a date with me .
hey , nick .
jess ...
... ica .
dirty j , dr. day , my toilet sister .
so , food ?
you want to get food later ?
i &apos;m gonna get dressed now .
okay , bye .
did you put the charger in the bathroom ?
the most neutral room in the loft .
yeah , well ,
i moved it to the kitchen .
the kitchen ?
hey , guys .
nick , what &apos;s more neutral ?
the awesome bathroom or the stupid , stupid kitchen ?
i have a lot of thoughts on this , but first ,
schmidt , i have a favor .
it &apos;s about my clothes .
burn them , burn them all .
no , no , no , no , no , i have a date tonight , and ,
you know , there &apos;s a lot of women who sleep with you ,
and i can &apos;t figure out why , so maybe it &apos;s about clothes ,
and maybe ...
are you asking me
if i &apos;ll help you pick out clothing
so you can seduce a woman ?
i was .
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s only all i &apos;ve been wanting
for the past ten years , nick .
yes , that is how you wrap a son of a bitch in wool .
now , if somebody asks you who you &apos;re wearing tonight ,
what do you say ?
i don &apos;t want to do that .
do it , bro .
i don &apos;t want to do that .
do it .
i &apos;m wearing schmidt .
yeah . yeah , you are .
and neckscape by winston .
oh ... whoa , who is that handsome devil ?
okay , now , here &apos;s some things you want to hide about yourself
on tonight &apos;s date , okay ?
definitely , yeah .
that you &apos;re cheap , you &apos;re a heavy drinker ,
you &apos;re broke and you have a problem with anger .
your car is horrible .
so go ahead and take my new foscapay .
what &apos;s a foscapay ?
uh , ford escape .
i &apos;m still work @-@ shopping nicknames .
by the way , who &apos;s the girl ?
who &apos;s the girl ?
who &apos;s the girl ?
yeah .
uh , what &apos;s her name ?
it &apos;s , uh , yeah , it &apos;s , uh ...
her name is , uh , obviously yolanda .
her last name is winston .
i should go .
oh , i love latino girls .
yolanda winston .
schmidt , that &apos;s a fake name .
yeah , but why would he lie about ...
oh , my god .
jess ...
nick is a male escort .
probably not a ...
jess , man .
yeah .
do you realize what it means
if jess and nick become a couple ?
nick is our glue , man . you know , without him ,
it just doesn &apos;t work-- it never has .
see what i mean ? he &apos;s awesome , man .
this is my , one of my best friends , too .
i &apos;m gonna use the bathroom .
nick ...
nick ...
all of our stories start and end with nick .
what if nick decides he &apos;s gonna leave us ?
well , you know what we have to do , right ?
we &apos;re gonna track jess down
and kill her with this knife .
we have to sabotage the date .
or we do your thing .
let &apos;s do your thing .
hey , jess .
hey .
what are you doing over there by the hot dogs ?
you gave me the address ,
i just assumed we were eating at the hot dog stand .
no ...
why are you wearing a suit ?
did you just apply for a loan or something ?
no , i &apos;m , uh ...
i &apos;m wearing schmidt .
you &apos;re wear ... you &apos;re wearing what ?
i &apos;m wearing schmidt , uh ...
winston shaved my face .
weird .
well , come on , let &apos;s get some dinner .
come on , i got a reservation . come on .
what ?
hi there , sir . i &apos;m afraid ... uh ,
you apparently didn &apos;t see the crosswalk was over there .
oh , let &apos;s not sweat the small stuff , officer .
i &apos;m walking across the street .
afraid i &apos;m gonna have to write you up for jaywalking .
stay calm , make tiny fists with your toes .
i &apos;m really sorry about this .
jess , i &apos;m not upset .
this man is merely doing his job .
you were right , i was wrong .
here you go , sir .
thank you , officer .
$ 340 ? !
yeah , i know it &apos;s a lot .
they raised it last year , i think .
have a good night , ma &apos;am .
all right , just scram .
you too , sir .
dinner ?
okay .
okay .
after you .
thank you .
very lovely .
what an establishment .
it &apos;s my favorite in the city .
right on time .
keep it coming .
hey , nick , can i ask you a question ?
what &apos;s on your mind ?
well , i &apos;m just asking if ... if this is a date .
what do you mean , &quot; is this a date ? &quot;
i &apos;m just ... i &apos;m asking you if this is a date .
it seems like a date .
you &apos;ve been thinking it &apos;s a date this whole time ?
i &apos;m just asking you .
how embarrassing for you .
no , for me , it &apos;s just hanging out in a suit ,
getting champagne with my friend .
i think we &apos;re ready to order .
i have an idea-
i &apos;m gonna have the bartender send over two tropical cocktails .
jess will be all , &quot; why , thank you . &quot;
nick will be all ,
&quot; grandpa didn &apos;t get a face full of japanese bullets
just so you could drink a melted popsicle . &quot;
or ...
we could break into a zoo ,
steal a bear ,
then we shoot that bear full of hep c ,
and then we release that bear in the restaurant
right when they order dessert .
winston , you &apos;re terrible at pranks .
i get that .
you don &apos;t think just a bear alone in a restaurant is enough ?
you know who would know what to do ?
i do know who would know what to do .
nick .
nick .
we can &apos;t call him , right ?
they have , uh , brussels sprouts with pancetta .
that &apos;s a fancy name for bacon .
hold the brussels sprouts . am i right ?
everybody loves bacon , jess-- new topic .
you know , um ... if this were a date ...
yeah , but it wasn &apos;t , jess ...
but , i mean , if it were ...
it wasn &apos;t a ...
and it &apos;s probably good
because your ex @-@ boyfriend just walked into the restaurant .
who ?
the only man we both loved .
russell .
hi , so this is why you dumped me , huh ?
oh , well ...
no ...
just kidding .
i &apos;m glad to see this is finally happening .
nothing &apos;s happening , so ...
nothing &apos;s happening
because i was never told it was happening ,
so if a happening happens
and you don &apos;t know that it happened ,
did it happen , you know ?
right on .
um , hey , enjoy my lucky table .
i &apos;m brandy .
you know what ?
can we just forget about this date ,
or not @-@ date , and ...
maybe start over
and go get a drink at the bar as friends ?
drinking to forget ?
that &apos;s my sweet spot .
let &apos;s do that .
okay .
these clothes are so uncomfortable .
glad to get it off . in there .
you ready to drink with a friend ?
i am , jess .
yes .
let &apos;s do this .
why isn &apos;t the crosswalk here ?
just let it out .
just let it out .
this is where people
want to cross , sir .
we don &apos;t need our table .
we &apos;re sitting at the bar . not a date .
your table &apos;s all yours-- not on a date .
i think we &apos;re doing too much brainstorming
and not enough good old @-@ fashioned remembering .
what &apos;s the worst thing that you &apos;ve ever experienced on a date ?
* i will be your father figure *
* put your tiny hand in mine *
* i will be your preacher teacher *
* anything you have in mind *
* i will be your father figure *
* i have had enough of crime *
* i will be the one who loves you *
* till the end of time *
