&quot; this is why we fight &quot;
there is a procedure to treat epilepsy
that involves surgically severing the connection
between the left and right brain .
the goal is to block signals that cause seizures .
a packet ?
we &apos;re gonna convince these people
to give us $ 175 million with a packet ?
it &apos;s a nice packet .
mer , owen stopped calling .
if this doesn &apos;t work ,
he &apos;ll never speak to me again .
once we buy the hospital , the sneaking around stops .
and once owen finds out what we did ,
he &apos;s gonna be the happiest of all .
derek is completely convin--
the problem is ,
this also cuts off the brain &apos;s ability
to communicate with itself .
hey .
hi .
good morning .
the left side has no idea what the right side is up to .
the patient may experience problems
with coordination ...
memory , speech .
okay , really ?
it &apos;s been a week .
what the hell is going on ?
you walk out , no warning ,
and now the hospital &apos;s falling apart .
yesterday a bunch of nurses walked .
we lost lab techs , support staff .
what ?
i mean , if you wanted to screw the pegasus deal , success ,
high five .
but now people are saying that without a buyer ,
the whole place could go belly @-@ up in a month .
what are you trying to do ?
we--
cristina .
fine . whatever .
it &apos;s a drastic solution that &apos;s only considered
when all other options have failed ,
because once a surgeon makes that cut ,
there &apos;s no going back .
shane , have you seen the chief ?
yeah , he &apos;s right over ...
i &apos;m too young to be this tired .
at least we still have jobs .
stop saying that . hospitals don &apos;t just close .
right ?
chief , the o.r. &apos; s are overbooked .
seven more nurses didn &apos;t show up for their shift today .
too many surgeries , not enough staff .
um , do me a favor .
go back up there and see what can be pushed .
dr. bailey , you look nice . new suit ?
old suit .
been in the back of my closet since my last job interview ,
somewhere around y2k .
you &apos;re going on interviews ?
this place is a sinking ship .
this place is not sinking .
we &apos;re having some trouble , but we &apos;re gonna fix this .
cahill &apos;s convinced pegasus to come back to the table .
she &apos;s having that meeting right now ,
and she &apos;s going to make this sale .
everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
whatever you say , cap &apos;n .
bailey , please .
they &apos;re reevaluating their offer
based on all of these walkouts .
we can &apos;t afford to lose another surgeon ,
most of all you .
me ?
you &apos;re the heart of this hospital ,
the spirit .
you set the tone that others can aspire to .
this place can &apos;t function without you .
right , brooks ?
what ?
yes . right .
fine .
you better be right .
&apos;cause if this boat goes under
and i don &apos;t have a life jacket ,
i &apos;m coming looking for you ,
fists swinging .
and i &apos;m short , so my punches land low .
i think dr. webber &apos;s having a stroke .
you need to go .
where ?
don &apos;t care . just go . go now .
she &apos;s pretty .
mom .
how was breakfast ?
ah , informative .
if what richard tells me is true ,
it &apos;s time for you to come to boston .
what have you done ?
okay , now just wait a second .
i &apos;ve seen the kind of garbage
that goes on in a pegasus hospital .
if your options are either working for them
or this hospital shutting down altogether--
catherine ,
okay , this hospital is not shutting down .
in uncertain times ,
men like jackson and myself have to stand tall .
we can &apos;t pack up and flee at the first sign of trouble .
a man who does not bend to the winds of change
is a man that you can be proud of .
that &apos;s poetic .
i &apos;m just sayin &apos; , let &apos;s slow down
and see how this all shakes out .
i don &apos;t think--
mom , i agree with dr. webber ,
with--with richard .
i can &apos;t say that i like this at all .
you can push it a day .
it &apos;s a tumor surgery on a little kid .
right , but is he &quot; dying today &quot; sick
or &quot; can &apos;t play soccer but still hanging on &quot; sick ?
i &apos;ll see myself out .
you take bobby brinn in for his pre @-@ op scans yet ?
oh , no , not yet .
what about julie chang &apos;s labs ?
just about to do that .
are you pissed at me ?
what ?
i blew you off last night , and you &apos;re pissed at me .
i &apos;m pissed because i have 85 million things to worry about
since robbins walked out .
you hanging out with your boyfriend isn &apos;t one of &apos; em .
i shoulda gone to hopkins when i had the chance .
i &apos;ll get those labs .
okay , so this time , i &apos;ll do the peds and trauma stuff first .
and then i will go into the neuro .
okay , can somebody else do the closing ?
i @-@ i was awful last time we practiced .
no , you were fine .
we really want to end on my flop sweats ?
derek , you do the closing .
i &apos;m sorry . it should be just a few more minutes .
can i get you any water or coffee ?
no , no , i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine .
coffee .
and a bagel or something .
i &apos;m starving .
this meeting was supposed to start half an hour ago .
okay , he &apos;s a billionaire .
one of his minutes is worth 40 of ours .
i can &apos;t believe we got this meeting in the first place .
yeah , nice job , stan .
i really believe julian crest is our guy .
he made all his money in late @-@ stage internet mobile .
medical tech is the one area he doesn &apos;t have a foothold .
your focus on applied research ,
it &apos;s right up his alley .
yeah , well , someone should buy him a watch .
who are you calling ?
heather brooks .
mousy .
wait . what are you doing ?
what happened to not talking to anyone ?
i left patients behind . she &apos;s keeping an eye on them .
i haven &apos;t said anything to her .
i &apos;m giving her advice .
we &apos;re all set if you &apos;ll follow me .
oh , okay .
leave it .
i am not the heart of the hospital .
i &apos;m a chump who didn &apos;t quit when she had the chance .
now i &apos;m stuck cleaning up the mess .
brooks , you gonna answer that phone ?
sorry .
oh , it &apos;s my mom .
she &apos;s going through a rough patch .
less about your mom .
right . okay . uh , melissa keyser , 28 years old .
she &apos;s a former patient of dr. grey &apos;s .
she &apos;s been on dialysis but has exhausted all viable veins
and is now septic .
which means she &apos;s done . ha .
dr. grey left me a hopeless patient .
of course she did .
may as well have left me a pillow to smother her with .
are you the doctor ?
my mom won &apos;t wake up .
dr. granville to recovery .
you &apos;re lurking .
you blame me ?
i did it . they &apos;re in .
the deal closes at 8 : 00 a.m. tomorrow .
seattle grace mercy west will officially
be a pegasus horizons hospital .
i can &apos;t--that &apos;s-- really ?
i told you i was good at this .
there are just a few things to iron out ,
so i &apos;ll find you when we &apos;re done .
okay , well , i have-- i have a surgery ,
but i could--i could come in right--
no , go , go . be a doctor . i &apos;ll find you .
okay . hey , alana ?
thank you .
you are investing in an institution ,
a reputation , a legacy .
but seattle grace mercy west hospital
is worth more than its past .
our plan is to build on that reputation ,
to make seattle grace a place where medical innovation
is developed and delivered to the patients who need it .
that is our plan .
that is the future of seattle grace .
and we invite you to be a part of it .
neat .
we &apos;ll , uh , let you know .
i thought you were taking us to julian crest ,
not his day care center .
you don &apos;t just walk in
and talk to a guy like julian crest .
there are hoops to jump through .
those junior execs like us ,
they pass us up to his business development guys .
we impress them , then we see the man himself .
oh . will they do this before or after their naptime ?
you were golden in there .
there &apos;s no way you don &apos;t make it to the next level .
i &apos;m telling you , any second now
this phone is gonna ring .
really , any second now .
yes , i understand .
what are they saying ?
yes , yes , yes . i understand .
understand ? what do you understand ?
thank you . thank you very much for your time .
you guys , you were kind of rude .
well , what did they freaking say ?
i &apos;m sorry . you got the meting .
yes .
brooks .
brooks ,
what &apos;s the story ?
i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m on bailey &apos;s service today ,
and she is not your biggest fan .
okay .
melissa keyser &apos;s in septic shock .
her last systolic was in the 70s ,
but bailey &apos;s not ready to throw in the towel yet .
which is why i &apos;ve been trying to reach you .
so i found this article on surgeons
crafting artificial arteries ...
for patients with exhausted vessels .
brooks , what are you doing in here with the lights off ?
gotta go , mom .
bye .
dr. bailey , here is the work @-@ up .
maybe we really do need to look into that smothering pillow .
you know ...
i actually think i read an article
about artificial arteries for patients
with exhausted vessels .
really ? tell me more .
i don &apos;t remember more .
well , then find me that article .
angry avery returns .
what ?
your face .
you get all mad and your eyebrows do that thing .
it &apos;s cute .
it &apos;s my mom .
she &apos;s been on me for years to come back to boston
and take a leadership role in the harper avery foundation .
and now she is ringing that bell again--
that loud , very loud bell .
you &apos;re leaving ?
no . i work here .
did you prep mrs. preston
for the rhinoplasty ?
that &apos;s been pushed .
leah says dr. hunt &apos;s canceling all non @-@ emergent surgeries .
i actually thought that &apos;s what angry avery--
that &apos;s the fifth time this week .
i never thought i &apos;d say this ,
but maybe my mom has a point .
okay , bobby .
so here &apos;s the plan--
what i &apos;m gonna do
is i &apos;m gonna make a small incision
right about here .
then i &apos;m gonna take phil
and i &apos;m gonna stuff him in a bag .
and i &apos;m gonna chop him into a tiny million little pieces .
and then i &apos;m gonna yank him right outta there .
and adios , phil .
hear that , phil ?
you &apos;re going down .
phil &apos;s his tumor .
he was 6 when we found out about the mass .
bobby heard &quot; man , &quot;
which , you know , kind of made it easier to talk about .
there &apos;s this evil little man inside of him .
dr. karev ,
can i keep phil &apos;s head ?
when i &apos;m done grinding up phil ,
there &apos;s not gonna be a head left to keep .
that &apos;s so gross .
just admit it , dr. hunt .
my gut &apos;s a mess because you screwed up .
adhesions are unfortunately a normal complication of this--
how can four surgeries in two years be normal ?
you &apos;re supposed to be in there clearing out my scar tissue .
instead you keep making more .
sorry i &apos;m late . i had to do ... lots .
and now you &apos;re gonna let tardy marty
dig around in me , too ?
why do i keep coming back to this chop shop ?
because today we &apos;re trying something new ,
something we only do with high @-@ risk patients .
which you certainly seem to be .
pick up on that , did you ?
andy , this is going to work .
what happens if i get up and walk outta here right now ?
the blockages caused by your scar tissue will stay blocked ,
and then you die .
well ...
you could &apos;ve led with that .
uh , something i can do for you , avery ?
i don &apos;t know . is there ?
what ?
i think you know something .
i know many things .
the kind of things to get a man talking
about winds of change
and standing firm ,
even though it feels like the ground
is about to crumble out from under me ?
a week ago , i came across torres , yang ,
robbins , shepherd , and grey
all having some kind of powwow .
when i asked them what they were up to ,
they slammed the door in my face
like i was diane keaton at the end of &quot; the godfather . &quot;
hour later , they resigned .
that sound at all suspicious to you ?
sir , something tells me you used to watch
a lot of &quot; unsolved mysteries . &quot;
i solved three of &apos; em .
this would restore seattle grace mercy west
as the region &apos;s leader in adult and pediatric trauma medicine .
dr. shepherd ?
yeah , we &apos;ll lead the way in neuroscience--
a dedicated research institute
for the advances of brain mapping ,
with applications to the treatment of alzheimer &apos;s
and parkinson &apos;s disease--
may i stop you for a second ?
we would love to see a little bit more
on the financials--
income statements , profit projections ,
cash flow ...
your allocation of revenue--
perspective payment for ms @-@ drgs
versus capitation income ?
we &apos;ve got all that ...
yep . right here . got it .
marketing , customer retention plans--
is there a trend study here ?
yep . one second .
i &apos;m just running it by mr. crest .
mr. crest apologizes ,
but he &apos;s leaving this evening for dubai .
oh . okay .
dubai .
but ... he can make 15 minutes for you this afternoon .
great .
thank you .
that &apos;s good .
alana .
i didn &apos;t expect it to happen this quickly ,
but i also didn &apos;t expect it to happen this way .
i know .
the board just needs to review their counteroffer and accept .
i called an emergency meeting in an hour .
i would like you to be there when i tell them .
have you told dr. hunt yet ?
that pegasus is buying his hospital for parts ,
liquidating its assets , laying off its staff ?
i just haven &apos;t figured out how .
it isn &apos;t pretty , but we needed a deal .
and it &apos;s a deal .
brooks ? what &apos;s going on ?
is it bailey ?
uh , it &apos;s my fault . it &apos;s my fault .
everybody &apos;s gonna lose their jobs
&apos;cause i had a stupid idea .
oh , no , no , don &apos;t .
nobody is gonna lose their jobs .
everybody is . brooks heard it straight from cahill .
the hospital is liquidating .
the deal is closing tomorrow morning .
does owen know ?
she didn &apos;t say .
all right , so crest is our last meeting ,
and it &apos;s our only chance .
in two hours .
oh , no pressure or anything .
okay .
well , if we only get 15 minutes ,
then we need to make the most of them , so--
right .
right , right . we can &apos;t just sit on our thumbs
and let &apos; em read stan &apos;s boring crap .
no offense .
none taken . it &apos;s interesting to me .
we need to know all of this boring crap , too .
all right , so we need to be able to answer
every single question he could ask .
okay , well , let &apos;s divide it up .
stan , give us all the boring crap you have .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
it &apos;s true . cahill said--
brooks ...
okay . y @-@ you--you just can &apos;t say anything to anyone else .
something like this , it &apos;s ...
people panic . it &apos;s too ...
it &apos;s too big .
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
this morning , you called this place a sinking ship .
no , that &apos;s different .
i never--never thought it would actually sink .
you keep your mouth shut , you hear me ?
they are stripping us for parts
like a busted ass truck .
what , and we &apos;re just supposed to believe that
because you got a kicky little haircut ?
and also because it &apos;s true .
ugh . i &apos;m gonna be sick .
and i have a surgery .
i &apos;m gonna be sick in my final surgery .
this is not how i wanted to go out .
jackson might be going to boston .
i mean , i don &apos;t know . maybe i--
stop right there .
i know this is really bad , but don &apos;t be that girl .
what girl ?
that girl who follows her boyfriend across country
like a puppy dog .
i am not that girl .
they were just awarded millions of dollars .
i &apos;d quit my job , too .
no , you wouldn &apos;t , and neither would they .
they &apos;re not that kind of people .
oh , that &apos;s bull .
they &apos;re exactly that kind of people .
they &apos;re only out for themselves .
they &apos;re probably pooling their money together
for some private practice or something .
i don &apos;t buy it .
you want to start a restaurant , you don &apos;t use your own money .
and they have no reason to keep that a secret .
i should gone to freakin &apos; hopkins .
yeah , that was a bad move .
what do you think &apos;s going on over there ?
you guys , we cannot say anything .
news like this will just make people panic .
yeah , no kidding .
i &apos;m panicking .
exactly , so don &apos;t say anything .
don &apos;t say anything about what ?
you heard .
your intern .
damn that girl . i ...
could just grab her by the hair ...
what &apos;s that ?
oh , i &apos;m ...
giving a patient an artificial artery
so that she can stay on dialysis .
keep her alive long enough
to get the kidney she &apos;s been waiting on .
sounds like fun .
want to scrub in ?
might be our last chance .
one more for the road .
i thought i &apos;d be chief of surgery someday .
you shouldn &apos;t spread that kind of rumor .
it &apos;s not a rumor .
i heard it from brooks . she heard it from--
that is a textbook rumor .
and it &apos;s not true . just ask hunt . he &apos;ll tell you .
he &apos;d never confirm something like that to an intern .
you ask him .
it &apos;s not my rumor .
hey . we ready to roll ?
as an academic medical center ,
we are currently at 411 beds .
but once we &apos;re restored
to a level i trauma center , that number will raise to 500 .
right , increasing revenue streams
for both acute and long @-@ term care .
pause .
whoa , whoa , whoa . this is in chinese .
literally in chinese .
tell simon i need these in english before i go back in there .
and have alyse cancel my tee time at canterwood .
right away .
sorry . go .
yeah , we &apos;re all very--
did--did sandy take my luggage already ?
i need my charger thingy .
so we &apos;re passionate about patient care
and medical advancement .
we want to be the premier hospital in the u.s.
for both .
your bags are at sea @-@ tac already .
should we bring them back ?
no , that &apos;s silly .
not you . you &apos;re great . keep going .
all right , we would comprise the managing board ,
and with you being the primary shareholder , you could--
whoa , whoa , whoa , wait . stop . go back .
i thought you were looking for an outright buyer .
you want to run this ?
we do .
but we all trained and worked there .
yeah , we know the place better than anyone .
we &apos;ve invested ourselves--
yes . invested yourselves . i love that .
you have totally done that .
the shepherd method of viral glioblastoma treatment--
dr. grey , your name was on that , too , right ?
it was .
you wrote the book on , uh ,
scaffold @-@ free cartilage fabrication .
first in your class at smith , berkeley , and stanford .
and tim kenner at hopkins won &apos;t shut up about you .
oh , well , um , clearly , you &apos;ve done your homework .
yeah , i did .
what i found is , there &apos;s not a manager in the bunch .
no administrative leadership experience .
you gotta have someone who can keep the lights on .
dr. shepherd was the chief of surgery .
yeah , for about ten minutes .
then you stepped down , own volition , no reason given .
what my gut tells me is , you didn &apos;t like it .
surgeons like surgery .
i know when i find something i don &apos;t like doing ,
i don &apos;t do it well .
they &apos;re ready for you .
sorry . i have three meetings before i get on a plane .
thank you all so much for coming to me with this .
i respect your passion .
i share it .
but i &apos;m not feeling this .
get someone on your team
with some real administrative experience ,
and we can talk .
this is what i &apos;ve been saying .
we have the experience .
well , he doesn &apos;t think so . so we &apos;re--
don &apos;t . don &apos;t do that . don &apos;t do that , okay ?
there &apos;s still something we can do .
what can we do ?
he wants experience . let &apos;s get richard .
what about the guy who &apos;s chief now ?
well , we can &apos;t tell owen .
what the hell difference does it make now ?
we need him .
all right , so if we get richard and owen , then what ?
do we get another meeting ?
crest is leaving for dubai tonight .
well , then we do it before he leaves .
uh , okay . well , we can &apos;t all march into the hospital .
well , i &apos;ll go . i &apos;ll go get richard .
okay .
brooks , if that &apos;s your mother on the line , so help me ...
dr. webber , dr. grey is in the waiting area for you .
it &apos;s urgent .
meredith grey ?
um , brooks , come over here and assist dr . bailey , please .
wait . you &apos;re not actually going .
i &apos;m sorry , bailey . hurry .
what else ?
what else can meredith grey possibly take from me today ?
she gave us this fix .
what &apos;s that ?
she gave us this fix .
she doesn &apos;t even work here anymore ,
and she &apos;s still out there trying to help her patients .
uh , what the hell are you doing sharing patient details
with someone who doesn &apos;t even work here ?
she cares .
oh , she cares ?
now don &apos;t you tell me about caring .
i &apos;m the heart of this damn hospital !
all right , these adhesion barriers we &apos;re placing
should keep the tissue separate while it heals .
you said &quot; should &quot; ,
but you told andy that they would for sure .
right , with a guy like andy ,
you tell him the best version of the story .
so what happens if it doesn &apos;t work ? ross .
well , if it doesn &apos;t work , then we come back in six months
and we try again .
but we won &apos;t be here in six months .
ross heard a stupid rumor
that the hospital is shutting down ,
and now he &apos;s apparently having a breakdown .
all right , everyone , i shouldn &apos;t be telling you this .
it is still in the works ,
but pegasus is buying this hospital .
and nobody is going anywhere .
you &apos;re lying .
he wouldn &apos;t lie--
yes , he would . he just told us that he would .
only this isn &apos;t telling the best version of the story .
it &apos;s a flat @-@ out lie .
what are you talking about ?
don &apos;t pretend like you don &apos;t know .
pegasus is buying the hospital so they can liquidate it .
we &apos;re all losing our jobs .
would you just tell him it &apos;s not true ?
it is not . who said that ?
cahill .
it &apos;s okay . uh , i got this .
he lied then he walked away .
he didn &apos;t lie , ross .
he didn &apos;t know .
have fun in the bag , jerk face .
morcellator , please .
that &apos;s gnarly .
yeah , bobby would love this .
we could record the live feed .
he could rewatch the carnage . share it with his friends .
nah . he &apos;d be expecting arms and eyeballs and crap .
finding out the truth would break his freaky little heart ...
about santa claus
and how people get sick and let you down ,
and everything just falls apart .
till then he can believe whatever the hell he wants .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
i mean , i &apos;m a grown @-@ up
and i was still a little disappointed
we didn &apos;t find arms and eyes in there .
all right , here we go .
oh , sick .
well , that &apos;s a very interesting offer , sir .
but i wouldn &apos;t be comfortable with ...
really ?
that &apos;s a--really ?
i was able to do some rearranging
and get avery &apos;s rhinoplasty back on the board .
he &apos;s on the phone with the boston chief of plastic surgery .
jo was right . you &apos;re that girl .
i know .
we &apos;re all about to lose our jobs ,
and all i can think about is the fact
that i &apos;m gonna have to stop sleeping with him .
i &apos;m so gross .
come on . the sex can &apos;t be that good .
look at him .
really ?
i &apos;m gonna go talk to him .
every step you take
is a giant leap backward for womankind .
there goes the right to vote .
roe vs. wade .
cut it out .
besides , you &apos;re just as bad .
you were hung up on karev for weeks .
yeah , but you don &apos;t want to be like me .
you hate me .
thanks .
and i don &apos;t hate you .
yeah , you do .
what are you doing here ?
i have to talk to you .
oh , now you want to talk ?
you &apos;re about a week late . i need to find cahill .
you have to listen .
owen , is it true ,
they &apos;re selling the hospital for scrap ?
this is the deal you made ?
this is the deal you made--
you , shepherd , and all of you--
when you walked out on me , when you lied to me !
we &apos;re trying to buy the hospital .
so we &apos;ve been looking for an outside investor ,
trying to get the money together , but we &apos;ve hit a wall .
i &apos;m good for $ 3 million .
no , richard . we don &apos;t want--
no , i just have to move some things around .
it &apos;ll be everything i have , but i am in .
no , we don &apos;t need your money . we need your experience .
we need you .
i mean , we &apos;ll take your money , too ,
if it comes down to it , but--
how much do you need ?
$ 175 million .
that &apos;s pretty good .
it &apos;s not really funny , is it ?
no .
so we only walked out to stall the sale to pegasus .
and it &apos;s not over .
we have an investor .
we just need you and webber to get him on board ,
now , before the pegasus deal closes .
you couldn &apos;t tell me this ?
why couldn &apos;t you just tell me this ?
i could &apos;ve fought for you . i could &apos;ve fought with you .
i &apos;m sorry .
i wanted to tell you . i wanted to .
but they said you signed nondisclosures .
and if anyone found out you were involved
in a competing bid ,
they could sue you ,
or if they were pissed enough , jail you .
please trust me . i @-@ i ...
i was trying to protect you .
you don &apos;t need to protect me .
wait , wait , wait . where are you going ?
the board .
if they think we can save this place ,
it could buy you some time .
you can &apos;t take that chance .
cristina , you need to trust me , too .
boston then ?
no . not boston .
my mom wouldn &apos;t want to win that way anyway .
but it &apos;s probably time
to start thinking about someplace else .
what about you ? where are you headed ?
i ... don &apos;t know yet .
well , you never know .
we could end up somewhere near each other .
that wouldn &apos;t be the worst thing in the world .
yeah . sure .
suction , please .
hey , buddy .
they got him .
they kicked phil &apos;s butt straight to the curb .
i wish you coulda seen the look on his face
when i pulled his eyeballs right out of his stupid head .
oh , dude . it was so nasty .
there were brains and hair everywhere .
don &apos;t forget the intestines .
how could i ?
they got all tangled up in my tools
like spaghetti .
we had to take a break just to get rid of all the goo .
what else ?
excuse me .
you okay ?
you faking ?
joke &apos;s on you .
there aren &apos;t gonna be that many more surgeries
for you to con out of me .
you &apos;re gonna be fine . there are other programs .
not like this one .
not with a teacher like you ...
who shows me
cool tumor @-@ in @-@ a @-@ bag surgeries
and thinks it &apos;s fun to talk to little kids
about guts and stuff .
you know , i , uh ...
i barely saw you this week ,
and it sucked .
i &apos;ll find another job . whatever .
i , uh , but i don &apos;t want to never see you again .
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m okay . i &apos;m good .
thank god stephanie wasn &apos;t here to see this .
section 15,
allocation of equipment , basically states that
all of seattle grace mercy west medical devices ,
radiology equipment , etcetera ,
will be distributed between pegasus &apos; existing facilities
at their discretion-- dr. hunt .
you can &apos;t take this deal .
dr. hunt , can we step outside ?
dr. hunt , i &apos;m sorry .
it isn &apos;t what you want .
it isn &apos;t what any of us want , but it is the deal we have .
no , it isn &apos;t . i have another buyer .
i &apos;m sorry . i told you . he &apos;s not available .
rita , i &apos;m right here .
hey , guys .
this is the leadership you asked for--richard webber .
pleasure .
pleasure .
richard was seattle grace &apos;s chief of surgery for 12 years .
um , can we have a moment to talk to you ?
i have to be on a plane in 20 .
can you guys ride with me ?
that &apos;s fine , yeah .
i only have room for two of you .
not fair .
so what do we do now ?
we go pick them up .
it is a solid capital investor
with a team of surgeon consultants
led by richard webber ,
derek shepherd , dr. torres , robbins ...
a group of disgruntled employees .
grey , yang , and myself .
well , where are they , then ?
they can formally present their offer to you tomorrow
if you hold off on this sale to pegasus .
no , you can &apos;t do that .
you can &apos;t make pegasus wait--
you all have a choice here .
you can either be responsible for consigning
this world @-@ class hospital to the scrap heap ...
there &apos;s no choice .
or ...
it &apos;s not a deal .
or you can partner with the doctors
who made this place what it was
and see what it can be .
the pegasus deal went away once .
if it goes away again , you have nothing--
no severance packages ,
no paying off creditors .
you can &apos;t make payroll next week .
nothing .
all we need is one day .
one day .
do you see them ?
there .
do they look happy ?
i can &apos;t tell .
sad ?
i can &apos;t tell .
i got them to wait .
the board is gonna wait for one more day .
you can make your pitch .
i did it .
we didn &apos;t .
crest met with richard , liked him ,
liked all of us ,
then he said no .
said he just wasn &apos;t feeling it .
so it &apos;s over .
it &apos;s over .
dr. kepner ?
andy &apos;s awake .
he &apos;s got some questions ,
and i couldn &apos;t track down dr. hunt .
okay . i will be right there .
i just needed some air .
can i ask you something ?
you want to know how something like this could happen ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess i @-@ i have to believe
that everything happens for a reason .
it &apos;s all part of some ... plan ,
and you &apos;re supposed to learn something .
you lose a patient
because you forget to check their airway ,
you don &apos;t make that mistake again .
you--you fail your boards
&apos;cause you &apos;re too busy sleeping with your best friend ,
maybe you stop doing that .
the hospital you call home shuts down ,
just when you &apos;re finally starting to feel ...
like you &apos;ve got your life together ...
actually , i was gonna ask for a letter of recommendation .
but i could probably ask someone else .
that might be best .
go on home , brooks . i &apos;ll take it from here .
if it &apos;s all the same , dr. bailey ,
i &apos;d prefer to stay .
suit yourself .
what &apos;s wrong with your face ?
you &apos;re right .
you are the heart of the hospital .
i was , brooks .
was .
we &apos;re not buying a house .
hmm . well , we &apos;re not buying a hospital .
we could buy a house ...
or build one .
we don &apos;t even know where we &apos;re gonna be in six months .
so we build it in chicago or miami ,
or new york .
we have each other ,
and we have a beautiful baby so ...
we can go wherever we want .
probably want to sell mark &apos;s place , right ?
probab @-@ probably .
we don &apos;t have to move yet , do we ?
no .
not yet .
vermouth ?
that &apos;ll have to do .
oh , and now you &apos;re stealing my freakin &apos; booze .
it &apos;s just vermouth .
shut up .
you don &apos;t get to make stupid little jokes .
we had a good thing going , all of us .
and now people are losing their jobs ,
and it &apos;s your fault .
we were trying to buy the stupid hospital .
we were trying to help ,
and we screwed up .
i &apos;m sorry .
40 @-@ year @-@ old scotch . a patient gave it to me .
now you &apos;re gonna sit down ,
and you &apos;re gonna freakin &apos; talk to me .
oh , derek , it &apos;s over . enough . you have to stop .
yeah , i know .
ross asked me to write a letter of recommendation ,
and i &apos;m gonna do them for each of the interns .
did you do one for heather brooks ?
who ?
mousy .
oh , no . not yet .
i will .
they were trying to buy the hospital themselves .
they ... they just needed more money .
they couldn &apos;t get it in time .
well , what are you gonna do now ?
well , i heard boston &apos;s awfully nice .
that thought has crossed my mind a time or two .
i just didn &apos;t want to be pushy .
that hardly sounds like you .
i poured so much of my life into seattle grace .
always seemed like a foregone conclusion
that i &apos;d end my career there , and i just ...
i &apos;m not ready to retire yet .
i never thought it would be gone before i was .
how much money did they need ?
what are you guys ...
folks !
you are right on time .
come on .
mom , come on . what is happening ?
have a seat . i &apos;m about to tell you .
there &apos;s a reason surgeons are willing to roll the dice
on a risky , go @-@ for @-@ broke ,
point @-@ of @-@ no @-@ return surgery
with potentially devastating consequences .
ladies and gentlemen ,
dr. webber &apos;s brought to my attention the fact
that all of you have been looking for an investor
to partner with you in purchasing
seattle grace mercy west hospital .
it is my pleasure to tell you
that the harper avery foundation would like very much
to take you up on that offer .
what ?
we have only one condition . only one .
since the foundation will be putting up
the majority of the funds ,
we would like a representative of our choosing
to sit on your board of directors .
my dears , we only have a couple of hours to make this bid .
do you want to do this thing or not ?
yes . of course .
okay , yes . yeah .
sometimes ...
it works .
wait , you woke up me at the crack of dawn
to tell me you &apos;re coming to seattle to be my boss ?
that doesn &apos;t-- oh , no , no , sweetheart . you misunderstood .
the foundation is electing you as our representative .
we &apos;re the majority shareholder .
that means you are in charge .
wait . what ?
now give your mama a kiss , jackson .
she just bought you a hospital .
