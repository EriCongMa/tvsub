Arthur Gibson, 52.
Worked as a sells manager for industrial machinery manufacturer.
Married?
No. Divorced.
Next. We need someone at our table.
Deborah Barber, 38.
Next.
Why?
Not sympathetic enough.
Really?
Is there a weight limit on sympathy?
Uh, Maureen Fenton.
Housewife. Divorced and remarried.
One daughter, 18.
How did she do it?
Handgun.
Killed her husband, then herself.
What's the daughter look like?
She signed on to the class action?
One of the first.
How will she do on the stand?
Good.
Then that's our test case.
Make sure she wears the cross.
But I thought Mr. Yates was doing it.
We thought so, too, but he got cold feet.
We know this is very last minute, Caitlin,
but we think MRG Pharmaceuticals is ready to settle.
We just need a strong test case to motivate them.
If I lose, the others can't sue, right?
Well, they can sue, but it will be harder.
But I'll have to be on the stand?
It's a good case, Caitlin. Really good.
And we need to make sure
they never make an antidepressant like that again.
Sometimes I wonder if God forgives her, you know?
I have these nightmares of Mom not in heaven.
Your mom didn't do this, Caitlin. The pills did.
You need to remember that.
I know.
Thank you.
Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light...
Of course, she has perfect pitch.
And this is bad, how?
It's at the end.
She gives ten percent to her church.
She works at a food kitchen once a month.
And she volunteers at her kids' school.
Private school?
No, public.
She lives frugally, quietly.
There were no complaints from neighbors, staff, or coworkers.
So she's a saint?
For Chicago or the world?
There are no saints.
The smaller the sin, the larger you have to make the magnifying glass.
There.
That's her husband.
Yeah, he's white, we know.
This is not the South.
With some issues, everywhere's the South.
I'll think about it.
She's good. No paper trail.
Keeps her distance from the machine.
No money I could find.
Nothing to get a foothold.
Hmm. My staff wants me to go after the miscegenation vote.
Her white husband.
Oh, yeah.
In some neighborhoods, that works.
I could work up some flyers.
What else?
I'm looking into some clinic visits.
There might be an abortion.
What? Did she film it?
No. We're still checking it out.
I am in a meeting.
You're not gonna like this.
I was tracking a "Q and A" That Wendy did up at Albany Park.
You know, getting some shots of people waiting,
trying to put together an idiot supporter montage.
Whoo! Wendy!
So what do you guys like about her?
She just makes a lot of sense.
You know, it-it's different.
With Obama now, politics is cool again.
No. No, no, no.
What's the case?
No case.
It's the folder I stole from your car.
Ah. Yeah.
After you trashed it.
So you, uh... you finding a lot in there?
Some.
You take a lot of notes.
Hey, do you know, uh, what I-LeGaL is?
It's the Illinois Lesbian & Gay Law Association.
They just rated Chicago law firms on their diversity
in hiring gays and lesbians, and transgenders and... whatever.
Anyway, Lockhart/Gardner & Bond did not do well,
even though I know for a fact that we have gay associates
who just aren't acknowledging that they're gay.
Now, in this day and age,
why would someone not be up-front about their sexual orientation?
Are you coming out?
You know the theory that I work under?
No.
It's better not to keep secrets
'cause then people don't go looking.
All right.
Hello.
Hi. It's me.
Yeah.
Uh, we need to talk.
No, I agree that's fantastic.
Okay.
MRG Pharmaceuticals just fired their team this weekend.
Alicia!
What, their jury consultants?
Their everything.
Our opponents just fired their lawyers;
they're going with a firm from New York.
They're scrambling.
Who did they get?
We don't know yet; we're trying to find out.
It's probably Bernstein, Meyers.
They won that asbestos suit last year.
Bring them on. They'll look like an army against us.
We'll have three women at the plaintiff's table;
they'll have a half-dozen out-of-towners.
It'll be David and Goliath writ large,
so I want you to handle voir dire.
Me?
Yes. Are you ready?
I am. Yes.
Um, Diane, as your jury consultant...
Don't worry, if they're bringing in New York,
we need to play up our recognizability in Chicago.
The New Yorkers will object, but let them.
They'll look like killjoys.
Diane, um... I just need a minute.
And a cup of coffee.
Okay. Don't be late.
You'll be good.
$30 to 40 million--
this could turn everything around for the firm.
Not to put too much pressure on you.
Can I have a regular coffee, please.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
Doors are heavy.
Yeah.
What?
Oh. My bus pass.
I must have dropped it.
I keep my ID with it.
I must have dropped it by the coffee cart.
Would you mind?
Yeah. Sure.
By the coffee cart?
Yeah, I think... I mean, I was by the bench for a minute,
but I think it's by the coffee cart.
Thank you so much.
What are we waiting on, Ms. Lockhart?
Uh, my co-counsel is just outside, Your Honor.
She is handling voir dire
and she should be here any moment.
Is the defense ready for voir dire?
Certainly, Your Honor.
Then let's go.
Mr. Canning.
Good morning.
First of all, I want to thank you for your service.
And I probably need to explain a few things.
What were you doing?
I'm sorry. There was a...
Good morning, Mrs. Florrick.
I hope you don't mind we, uh, started without you.
Now, uh, before I ask you just a few questions,
I- I think I probably owe you an explanation.
I suffer from a condition, tardive dyskinesia.
Which is really, it's just a funny word
for a neurological disorder.
And it makes me do this...
And... this. And...
But, uh...
if you just look at me long enough, you get used to it.
So, um... you know, feel free to look, and I-I won't mind.
Now the good news is... these pills.
I- I, um, take these every few hours,
and- and they don't make the symptoms disappear completely,
but they do diminish...
Objection.
Approach the bench.
Your Honor, defense counsel is using voir dire to argue his case.
You'll have to explain that to me.
This whole case hinges on a drug--
whether in fact an antidepressant drug your client manufactured
made people want to kill themselves.
Your Honor, I'm simply trying to make sure
that my symptoms won't be a distraction.
Part of my voir dire is to discover who will have problems
with my condition, and who will not.
Makes sense to me, Mrs. Florrick.
Overruled.
As I was saying, I don't want my symptoms to be a distraction,
but I have to tell you that they do intensify
when I become perplexed,
and I'm-I'm just, I'm really transparent that way.
So, for example, I don't want you to be distracted
when my opponents are questioning...
Objection.
So, are we going to have a trial at some point?
Your Honor, Mr. Canning is trying, yet again, to taint this jury.
How? I was helping you this time.
I just don't want my movements to be a distraction.
No, sir, you were guaranteeing that the jury
will be watching you throughout our testimony to see how you react.
My God, the cynicism here is breathtaking.
Have you thought maybe you might have a problem with disabled people?
Your Honor!
All right, all right. Mr. Canning,
let's try to keep the pained outrage to a minimum here.
I'm sorry, Your Honor. It's just a sore point with me.
Mrs. Florrick, I understand your point,
but I think Mr. Canning needs to inoculate the jury to his...
What is the proper word?
Condition.
Condition.
So again, overruled.
Did you have any luck finding my bus pass?
'Cause my driver might need it if the limo won't start.
Okay, we just turned into Goliath.
Hey, Johnny, you got a fast one?
I need to get out of here by 3:00.
Thanks. Oh, yeah. Of course it's the dog.
As usual...
Hey, Donna.
What's up?
You're talking to somebody.
I'm talking to somebody?
I'm talking to a lot of people.
Somebody from my office.
An investigator named Blake?
"Indecent exposure. Public masturbation."
Look. I need you to stop talking.
Kalinda. Four months,
and this is what you come to talk to me about?
How are you?
Oh, yeah.
Humanitarian of the Year.
Mr. Bay. Are any of you Mr. Bay?
Mr. Bay? I'm Donna.
I'm from the Public Defender's Office.
I'm here to defend you on charges of indecency,
masturbating in a public park.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
Are you masturbating right now?
Don't do that.
Get your hands out of your pockets, don't say a word.
Who do you have for us today, Ms. Seabrook?
An innocent man, Your Honor.
I'm sure.
Mr. Raymond Bay, an upstanding citizen,
who was arrested in Berger Park with his hands in his pockets,
supposedly making, as the arrest report states,
"The motions of masturbation."
But as we all know, the weather
along the shore last night was unseasonably cold.
Mr. Bay was doing nothing more than what any of us would do,
which was warming his shivering,
and therefore, shaking hands in his pockets.
Let this one go, Counselor.
Time served.
Next!
You're welcome.
You could make a lot of money at a big firm.
Why? When I meet so many interesting people here.
Everything's fine.
I didn't talk to anybody.
I didn't tell anybody your secrets.
And if this guy approaches me...
Blake.
I won't tell him how heartless you can be,
how insensitive,
how self-preservation is your number one concern,
and after four months,
you can barely say hello.
I won't tell him any of that, okay?
My sense is, we got the jury we wanted,
but the...
handicap of the opposing counsel has undercut
my earlier assumptions.
Meaning?
He's co-opted our jury.
I don't get it.
He's... handicapped?
And he's using it.
He's making the pharmaceutical company look like the good guy.
But the medical testimony will prove otherwise.
We still have a slam-dunk here.
Yeah, we're acting like we're the ones on the run here.
Talk to the doctors,
get them ready for some tough cross.
I'm trying to figure out...
how to broach this one.
Okay.
Why don't you give me a subject line?
Grace, your daughter.
She attended a Wendy Scott-Carr speech,
and spoke out for her.
We have it on tape.
But not for public consumption.
One of our trackers caught it.
One of our trackers?
Yes. I have to keeps tabs.
Well, what did she say?
Oh, Wendy's makes so much sense.
How there's so much corruption here.
I think she meant Chicago.
How much she likes her. I'm paraphrasing, but succinctly.
Okay, I will talk to her.
Thank you.
And I'm sorry to have to bring this to you.
I promise, next time, I'll bring something good.
Elvatyl is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
And this is the antidepressant drug manufactured by the defendant?
Yes.
It controls depression by stopping the brain
from reabsorbing serotonin.
I see. Now, let me ask you this.
In your latest clinical trial,
you found that people taking Elvatyl were three times as likely...
Sorry.
They were three times as likely to commit suicide
as those taking sugar pills.
Is that correct?
Yes, it is.
Uh, it appears that the serotonin transporter gene 5-HTT
increases the synaptic serotonin levels.
And how would you describe that in layman's term?
In layman's terms?
Well, as a threshold matter,
the mechanism for SSRI inhibition
is poorly understood.
Think of it as a train switchyard,
and the SSRI is the conductor,
with the track the absorption rate,
and the 5-HTT gene as the coal.
Thank you. No further questions.
Mr. Canning.
Thank you.
Doctor...
talk to me about sex.
About sex?
Yeah.
This stuff you're talking about-- this, uh, SSRL...
SSRI.
"I."
Um, how does it affect a person's sex life?
Well, I'm not sure I understand the question.
Well, if... for example, if there were feelings of jealousy,
this drug would intensify them, correct?
Yes, I suppose so.
But it couldn't create jealousy out of nowhere.
I mean, there would have to be a reason
for such jealousy to exist.
Objection. Beyond the scope.
Sustained.
Guess we can dodge that question for the moment.
All right, Doctor.
Getting back to SSRL's effect on a person's sex life...
Get lost.
So what is it?
The abortion?
No.
But I know why she was going to the doctor.
Breast augmentation.
You're kidding me.
No.
Four visits over two months.
So Mother Teresa got breast implants.
Does that humanize her or not?
I would say not.
I would say you're right.
She cares about the poor, and yet...
How much did she spend?
Over two months...
$19,000.
It's Clinton's haircut.
No, it's better than Clinton's haircut.
And yet...
What?
The candidate.
He won't go there.
Since when did you care where the candidate wanted to go?
Give me that.
What do you want, Eli?
You can just go to hell.
Uh-huh. And what have I done now?
That was ours. Go find your own.
Eli, you're blathering.
I'm just warning you-- stay the hell away!
Okay, I'm going now.
What does that do?
He's a Childs plant.
Mm-hmm. I've known for a week.
Just waiting for a chance to use.
So, go have him make a Xerox.
That's what I like about you, Eli.
Sorry.
Um, my mom was great.
And there was this change that came over her
after she started taking it.
Elvatyl?
Yeah. The doctor prescribed it.
I was going away to college, and my mom...
you know, empty nest syndrome.
Could you describe the change?
Within a day, she became more depressed.
She couldn't sleep.
She had nightmares that made her scream.
It was horrible.
Hello.
Your stepdad had just started a new job. Is that right?
Yes. Um, at Thurrell Interiors.
He designed furniture?
Yes. Couches and fold-out beds.
And he worked in a department with all women?
Yeah. Why?
Oh, no reason. I just...
I want to be clear on the facts. That's all.
11 employees-- all women--
and your stepdad.
Yes. He liked his job.
He spend some late nights there, did he?
At his work? I guess.
They were trying to get out the spring catalogue.
Well, what I'm saying is, actually...
This is a list of items the police vouchered
when they arrived at your mom's house.
I want you to do me a favor.
I want you to read for me item number seven.
"A gym bag"
"A bloody gym bag," It says.
And that was your stepdad's.
Uh, could... could you read for me item seven-B?
"Women's panties, black."
Ah, that's good.
And-and what does it say in the parentheses here?
"Small."
"Small." That's good.
Well, let me take that.
Caitlin, what size was your mom?
What size?
You mean, like, clothing?
Yeah.
I guess... a 12?
12... 12 would be large,
not... not the size of these panties.
It's all right.
You don't have to answer.
I - I do have to ask you this question, though.
Is it true that your mom and your stepdad
argued over a woman at work?
No.
A woman he was in love with?
Objection. No foundation.
Sustained.
Who was much younger and prettier than your mom?
Objection.
Mr. Canning, that's enough.
My apologies, Your Honor.
I have no further questions.
And, uh, I'm sorry for your loss.
We need to regroup.
So how are we doing today?
Your office is... small.
Yes. Small, but pure.
So, in the third year, do you get a window?
Should I shut the door?
No. No, it's bad enough they think
I'm going to flip back to the defense.
So what's up? What do you need?
Why do you think I need anything?
Because you're Kalinda.
My, uh... my usual sources have dried up here,
and... sorry.
I thought maybe you could help.
It's a personal matter.
It's a new investigator from Baltimore--
Blake Calamar.
Blake Calamar.
Yeah.
All right.
And what do I get in return?
Well, what do you want?
Who was she?
The woman who ran out of court?
An intern at Canning's firm.
Damn, if we could undercut Canning by subpoenaing her...
That's playing on his battlefield.
We need to pull him onto ours.
Ours is the medicine.
The problem with the medicine is it's boring.
But it's still the truth.
And the truth is boring.
He's got soap opera, and we've got genetic science.
That's always been our case.
No, that's our facts.
Our case is what we do with those facts.
And right now, our case is failing Caitlin.
We need to make medicine sexy.
Yep.
A lie always beats the truth.
Can adapt; it doesn't have to be consistent.
So we need to give the truth the drama of a lie.
Increased libido.
One of the side effects of Elvatyl
is it has a potential increased libido in women.
Good.
We need to meet our last expert witness.
Who is it?
I'm sorry, you want me to say what?
One of the side effects you noticed
was an increased desire for sex in public places.
Th... That's ludicrous.
It's in your study, Doctor.
No, it isn't.
Subject 18--
she mentioned it in her trial interview.
She was merely mentioning that as an aside.
Our trial interviewer quickly brought her back to point.
Yes, that was unfortunate.
We also want you to discuss the increased desire
for oral and anal intercourse
mentioned by Subject 35.
Ms. Lockhart, this is...
It's what we need, Doctor.
It's what Caitlin needs to win.
Well, I'm not a clown.
I'm not a performing circus animal.
I'm a man of science.
Suit yourself, Dr. Lawton.
But you've only fulfilled half your contract,
and we'll be stopping payment
as soon as you board that elevator.
Thank you, Doctor.
Did you happen to videotape any of your animal trials?
Your most violent ones?
I just wanted to hear her speak.
That's all.
And I want you to hear her speak,
but you did more than that.
You spoke to someone.
How do you know?
Someone videotaped you.
Who?
Are you angry at Dad?
No.
Somebody asked me a question, and I answered them.
It's a free country.
Yes, thank you, Grace.
You know this will hurt Dad.
Mom, she's really good. She really is.
Yes, and if you were her daughter, you could talk about that.
So I just can't say what I think?
You can say what you think here at home.
But just not to other people.
When you're 18.
I know you think I'm being unfair.
But when you're older,
and you do something I disagree with,
I won't tell it to other people.
I will tell it to you first.
Mom, it's politics. It's different.
No, this is family; it's not different.
Then, so, if I disagree with something Dad did,
I should just tell him?
What do you disagree with?
*Wendy Scott-Carr went to town*
*Just to buy a boob job*
*Stuck some tissues in her bra*
*And called it...*
*A personal matter, completely irrelevant to my job.*
*Wendy Scott-Carr's double-D...*
*Wendy is fantastic*
*Wendy cares for all the poor*
*But Wendy now is plastic*
Where did you find this?
Online.
So it could be anyone.
It could be the other campaign.
Is it?
That is why the 5-hydroxytryptamine gene
is a monoamine neurotransmitter.
Uh, thank you.
Now, in your clinical trials,
what did you find unusual about this surplus of tryptophan?
Well, oddly, in some subjects, it made them desire anal sex.
Anal sex? Really?
Was that surprising?
Yes.
And also, in one subject,
it caused an increased interest in exhibitionist sex.
Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.
The defendant's case is built on the premise that
Mrs. Fenton was jealous of her husband because he was having an affair.
We intend to show that Elvatyl
in fact encouraged sexual activity,
which could lead the jury to deduce
that the Fentons' sexual relationship was healthy...
We'll stipulate that Elvatyl causes increased libido, Your Honor.
Thank you, we'd like to argue our own case.
Overruled.
So, uh, Doctor,
by exhibitionist sex, you mean
sex in public places, like gas stations and shopping malls?
Oh, yes.
And in one instance, a public park.
Really?
And this was after injecting
white rats with minimal doses of Elvatyl?
Yes, we wanted to see the impact of
the 5-HT2C receptors on dopamine-producing cells.
You sure you couldn't find any place darker?
You want to go?
What?
You want to go?!
No.
I just want to make sure you feel anonymous enough.
You broke my heart.
Not intentionally.
Well, that's a relief.
Donna, I'm not...
I'm not domestic.
You think that's what I wanted?
Yeah, I do.
You're just trying to keep me in line.
What do you mean?
You phone me so I won't talk to your guy, Blake.
Can't I be multitasking?
I can't do this again.
Hurts too much.
Then don't think about it.
Look, it's just now, and we're just here.
And tomorrow we'll be someplace else.
And that's tomorrow.
I don't work that way.
All right, that-that's enough.
Mr. Canning, this is a very late addition to the witness list.
Yes, Your Honor, that's true.
But, as you know, I myself was a late addition to this case,
and, given my condition, I can be...
Oh, come on.
Oh, that's right. Mrs. Florrick gets offended when I bring that up.
I only talked to this therapist last night, Your Honor.
This isn't just any therapist, Your Honor.
This is the late Mrs. Fenton's therapist,
and, as such, any conversations they had are subject
to patient/therapist confidentiality.
But Mrs. Fenton is dead.
That doesn't matter.
The right remains intact after death.
In Illinois, yes, but not in Wisconsin.
Dr. Booth moved his practice to Wisconsin in 2009;
he continued to counsel Mrs. Fenton
both telephonically and in person.
This is outrageous.
You can't decide things differently based on geography.
Uh, actually, you can, counselor.
The therapist's notes and testimony regarding any post-2009 sessions
will be allowed.
Anything before that is disallowed.
So you were seeing Mrs. Fenton a week before
she shot herself and her husband?
Yes, I'm very sorry to say.
She was a very lovely woman.
I'm so very sorry, Caitlin.
And what did she discuss with you at that time, Dr. Booth?
Well, uh, many, many things, of course.
But, uh, she was very jealous
in the last month of her too short life.
Jealous?
Of her husband?
Yes.
She thought he was sleeping with somebody.
Did she say who she suspected him of sleeping with?
She thought he was sleeping with her daughter.
That'd be the plaintiff,
Caitlin Fenton?
Yes. But of course, this was just her suspicion.
That doesn't mean there was actually any reason to suspect.
Of course.
But did she give a reason for her suspicion?
Well, again, I would very much like to caution here:
this is merely what she said.
But she found underwear
among her husband's effects.
And did she say who the underwear belonged to?
Yes. Her daughter.
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.
So it's true, what the therapist said?
No. I mean,
my stepdad was...
I am so sorry.
He came into my room and he took my underwear. Once.
It wasn't a big deal,
but I told him to stop.
He said he would.
He pleaded with me not to tell my mom.
I am so sorry.
So there were no sexual relations?
No.
My mom came in, and she accused me of tempting him.
This is after she started taking the pills.
And that's why I was moving out.
I didn't want to be the test case.
I really didn't want to be.
Don't worry,
we'll make this work.
What are you doing now?
Anything you want, Mr. Gardner.
I need something on a Dr. Randall Booth,
a therapist in Wisconsin.
Anything specific?
Everything specific.
We need to kneecap him.
Whatever you can find.
Whatever we can use in court.
Okay, I'm on it.
Kalinda has been snooping around about me.
Don't worry about it.
If you say so.
*Wendy Scott-Carr's double-D...*
*Wendy is fantastic*
You know, it is pretty catchy.
*Wendy cares for all the poor*
*But Wendy now is plastic*
So no one is taking credit for this video yet,
but how are you dealing with all of it?
Well, it's difficult,
but I think that's just modern politics.
Is there perhaps, though, a good point to be made here?
I mean, you have shot up in the polls.
And you've done it as this friend of the downtrodden.
And yet, here we see you getting cosmetic surgery.
Were you concerned about your looks?
No.
About a year ago, I was diagnosed with stage-2 breast cancer.
Not even my best friends knew about it.
And, um, I had to undergo a double mastectomy.
I'm well now.
I know there was the option to live without reconstruction...
Anybody linking to the Wendy cartoon, stop now!
Stop!
I'm sorry for taking so long to respond to these allegations,
but it really is a personal matter.
And I just wish we would return to the issues.
So what have you got?
Oh, Kalinda, there you are.
You're working late.
Yeah, just trying to get a drug dealer off the streets.
Someone I'm sure Lockhart/Gardner
will be representing tomorrow.
Yep. I can feel the moral gravity pulling me in.
So, you called?
Blake Calamar.
Yeah?
It's an interesting read.
Do you want to share?
In Baltimore he was working two jobs,
but I guess you'd identify there.
The only problem was his second job--
it was protecting MS-13.
Yep.
When he wasn't protecting Bond & Associate interests,
he was out protecting Baltimore's biggest meth gang.
How do you know that?
He was arrested, never charged.
Bond got him off.
Oh, no.
That's official state's attorney business.
Got a lovely little viper nest going on over there.
If I were you, I'd be careful.
Thanks.
All I can say is my involvement with this Wendy cartoon
has become a distraction from the real issues in this campaign.
A toast to a fallen comrade.
...Childs had nothing to do...
It could have been us.
He had no knowledge of my involvement.
Not a bad day's work, huh?
Come on, Eli.
It's just you and me here.
You pointed the press toward him.
I was asked a simple question by a reporter
and I chose to answer it honestly.
And so I apologize to Wendy Scott-Carr
and to Glenn Childs.
Effective today, I tender my resignation from his campaign.
Thank you.
This announcement from Patrick Sturges is the latest...
Hey, Dad.
Dad?
And you were a patient of Dr. Randall Booth's
before he moved to Wisconsin?
Yes.
Your Honor, we must object again.
And we must overrule again, Mr. Canning.
Now, do you know the reason why Dr. Booth moved to Wisconsin?
The reason?
Well, I guess it was me.
You?
Can you explain?
Well, Dr. Booth, he...
I was his patient and he slept with me.
I threatened to bring charges
so he... well, he decided to move.
Who found her?
The witness her?
Yeah.
Blake did.
And do you have an opinion about Dr. Booth's veracity?
Objection, Your Honor.
Sustained.
Nothing further, Your Honor.
Your Honor,
it would be our preference to recall Dr. Randall Booth to the stand,
however it's come to our attention
that he's been hospitalized after a burglary attempt at his office.
We ask for a continuance
until we can recall this essential witness.
Denied. Is there anything else, Mr. Canning?
We ask for a five minute recess
so we can discuss a settlement with plaintiff's counsel.
Granted. We're in recess until 4:10 P.M.
So he said, "What do we need to end this right now?"
I love it when they say "We."
This is during the five minute recess?
Yeah, the clock was ticking.
So I said very simply,
as though it were the most natural thing in the world,
"You want to settle the whole class action? $40 million."
I thought he was going to come back at ten.
He comes in at 30.
Little did he know we'd take 20.
So we settle at 35!
$35 million.
Of which we get to keep $7 million.
We buy another floor of offices.
Two floors, with a gym.
Why do I seem happier than you?
Because you won.
The firm is solvent.
You make it sound so end-of-the-year boring.
This is big.
It is.
So smile.
No, Kalinda, a genuine smile.
Look, there's Blake.
Oh, I get it.
It's because he found the witness and you didn't.
Yeah, that's it.
Hey, look, Blake's got a date.
I've got to see what kind of woman dates Blake. Come on.
Hi, Blake.
Hey.
Hey.
Hi.
Oh, that's right, I think you two know each other.
Oh, no, I don't think we do. I'm Alicia.
No, he means me. Hi, Donna.
Kalinda. I was just heading home from work when Blake dropped by
and asked if I wanted to come.
So you work with Kalinda?
I do. And how do you two know each other?
Um, from the state attorney's office.
You're pretty.
Thank you.
If I wore heels like that,
I would tip over.
Donna, could we have a moment please?
Your jacket-- I like it.
Thank-thank you.
A moment?
Sure. Let's have a moment.
Hey, good job today.
Yeah, I was pretty bitchin'.
She's so not your type.
Donna, you're so off base.
Really? How far off base am I?
What's going on?
Are you trying to get back at me?
Oh, you mean Blake.
That's right, you did say something about a Blake.
I didn't even make the connection.
Look, I'm taking you home.
No, you're not.
You're not connected to me anymore,
and I'm not connected to you.
Thanks.
Mr. Canning.
Mrs. Florrick.
Are you looking for Diane?
I am. We have a few details to work out.
You fought well, sir.
Yes, yes, I did.
Better luck next time.
Why are we laughing?
Well, because we're funny.
Mrs. Florrick, you think you were my equal in that courtroom,
but you were new math,
I was, uh, advanced trigonometry.
Well, too bad trigonometry lost.
I didn't lose.
Lockhart/Gardner stumbled their way into a $90 million class action.
MRG Pharmaceuticals asked me to lower you down to $50 million.
I landed you at 35.
I'm going home with a bonus of $1.3 million and stock options.
That's not losing.
But, hey, it's been fun,
and maybe I'll see you again sometime.
We can mix it up in court.
