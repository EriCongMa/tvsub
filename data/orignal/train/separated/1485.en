Gloria, honey!
I'm ready whenever you are!
We should hurry. The reservation's at 7:00.
Claire, where are you?
Okay, see you in two.
What are you doing?
I'm striking a seductive pose for your mother.
Gross. But I like the suit. Is that new?
Oh, yeah.
Now that his honey gots her own money,
daddy went and snagged hisself some new threads, girl.
Hands down, your funniest voice.
Bordering on the offensive.
Listen, I'm a realtor,
and I work a lot with families,
so normally, I dial the sexy back to five,
but Claire's been working very hard lately.
So tonight...
Stick around if you want to see
your mom's tongue fall out of her mouth.
Not unless you want to see my lunch fall out of mine.
Oh, I'm sorry I am late.
Traffic was horrible.
Sounds like someone could use a tall drink of water.
Yeah, right. Water.
Luke, what did I tell you about
leaning back on that thing?
I don't know. "Don't"?
Honey, what are you still doing here?
You're supposed to be babysitting Joe.
Yeah, but I have to drop off Alex to watch Lily first,
and she's still not ready.
She can't be concerned about her looks, right?
I can hear you!
I'm kidding.
I'm just saying,
it'd be sad to think she actually tries.
Heard that, too!
It was a joke!
Man, do big ears actually hear better?
Oh, my God, just stop talking.
Okay, girls.
It's time for you guys to hit the road.
Okay, bye.
Oh, yeah, bye.
Bye.
Why aren't you going with them?
He wanted to stay home.
I said it was okay.
By himself?
It's fine.
If he's old enough to watch "The Walking Dead" with me...
He's not.
then he's old enough
to stay home alone.
He's not.
Claire, he's not a little boy anymore.
I'm fine.
See how deep his voice is?
Are you okay?!
Oh, this is Haley.
"Be there in 5. Alex took ducking forever."
Oh, it's fine. You know what?
We have to pick the "Save the date" card.
I'm at a loss.
Can we just do it tomorrow?
I hate the way my dad looks at us when we're late,
like we're two silly queens
blasting disco music,
primping, losing track of time.
Wow, it gets really busy in that head, huh?
Okay, quick. Which one do you like?
Uh, that one.
Really?
I think you picked too quick.
No, I didn't. I really like that one.
I really like this one.
Well, then, why did you ducking ask me?
Fine, goes with yours.
Well, if that's the one you really like.
Can you just get ready?
Yeah. Lily, hit it.
On it!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
I've never seen you so excited about a restaurant.
I've waited six weeks for this reservation.
They have an Australian Wagyu beef
that's supposed to change your life.
In the way heart disease changes your life?
Because you're a pillar of health.
They only feed this cow alfalfa, barley, and red wine,
and some chef hand-picks each cut,
dry ages it 35 days
before cooking it to a perfect medium-rare,
all for me.
Doesn't the wine make the cow drunk?
It's not "The Far Dide." The cow doesn't drive anywhere.
Gloria!
Let's go!
You know she's not here, right?
What?
She's having her hair blown out.
That's a thing?
That I pay for?
Gloria's always late.
Then I get mad and tell her to hurry.
We yell, and it just takes longer.
So I promised myself, no matter how late she is,
just to take some deep breaths and stay calm.
That's the only thing I learned in lamaze class
because we were always late.
Hi! Everybody's running like crazy tonight.
I took San Vicente thinking that I was gonna save some time,
but then they're working on the sewer.
So I went around Montana,
down Moreno.
But then there's that dip in the road.
I always forget about that dip in the road.
I hit it so hard that I spilled the coffee all over the car.
Did I tell you who I had coffee with?
I think Luke is scared to be left in the house alone,
and he's just pretending to be brave for you.
Honey, he's 14.
We left Alex alone when she was 10.
We didn't leave her. We forgot her.
And when we got home, she was fine.
Physically.
Plus, she's still friends with
that sweet 911 operator.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
Making sure Luke knows
what to do in case of emergency.
Of course he does.
Someone's at the door!
Luke, it's just your mom testing you.
Don't worry, mom.
If I hear that while you're gone,
I won't answer.
I'll just hide where no one can find me.
Cam, come on, let's go.
Two seconds.
I thought that being with a man
meant that I wouldn't have to wait around like this.
I feel cheated. I do.
Let's play dolls.
Actually, I want to read you one of my favorite books.
It's called "Little Women," and it's about four sisters
who overcome poverty and the patriarchy...
Nope! Dolls.
This is Ashley. She's a wife.
Well, I hope that's not the only thing that defines her.
Does she have a career?
Nope, she shops. Where's Haley?
How come it takes me five minutes to get ready,
and you take forever?
Oh, please. I could get ready in five minutes, too,
if I dressed like --
You did it again.
Not changing.
Fasten your seatbelts.
It's going to be a crazy night.
No, honey, it's gonna be a bumpy night.
Remember, you can't have two dads
and make that mistake.
Bumpy night.
Okay, so how often does this happen?
Too often.
Men just don't have that many options.
I can't tell you the number of times
I've walked by a women's boutique
and just thought, "What I would do
to have that many choices."
Don't ever say that again.
I don't like any part of it.
All right, one of us has to change.
We look like twin toddlers at church.
Yeah, tell me about it.
And this place we're going is supposed to be super hip.
We're probably gonna run into someone.
And come on. I don't have that many outfits.
My clothes take up exactly one-quarter of the closet.
That's not fair. My clothes are bigger than yours.
All right, I hate to play this card,
but I was dressed first. So...
Oh, that is silly.
Lily, it's time to play "Who wore it best?"
No, I'm not doing this again. I can't.
Fine. Alex.
Uh, I don't know.
Boys' clothes aren't really my thing.
Really?
I don't get it.
Doesn't the wine get the cow drunk?
Thank you.
Honest to God.
Have neither of you seen a cow?
They're huge.
I bet tequila would do it quicker.
It's not the goal to get the cow drunk.
You got to be kidding me.
Manny, see why your mother's taking so long.
And don't tell her I sent you.
Mom! Hurry!
Don't yell. I could have yelled.
Then why didn't you?
Because I didn't want to yell.
I want you to go.
Why can't you go?
Why can't you do what I ask?
I'm trying to do something new here!
Stop yelling, Jay! I'm ready!
Oh, geez.
Haley, Manny knows where all the baby stuff is,
and if Joe won't go to bed,
just put on Gladys Knight
and bounce him around a little bit.
Oh, you still do that?
I loved when you did that with us.
How about that?
Somebody in this family remembers a nice thing I did.
I remember something nice you did.
You bought me this dress yesterday when you were working.
How do I look?
Gorgeous. Let's go!
You didn't even look at me. Haley.
Well, "A," your hair looks amazing,
like you just got off a horse.
That's exactly what I was going for.
But if I had one thought...
No! No thoughts.
...are those for sure the best earrings?
They seem to be kind of getting lost.
I have the same color in a bigger size.
How much bigger?
Like a meter.
A meter? That's like a foot.
Actually, it's like a yard.
Oh, sorry -- it's like a millimeter.
You mean a centimeter.
All this math. Just show me.
Gloria!
What?
I think the new earrings
are really gonna tie your whole outfit together.
You're so sweet!
Wow. That was very mature of you.
Yeah, well, I'm a lot older now
than when she started getting dressed.
So this sound...
...that's the doorbell.
That other sound was the smoke alarm.
Got it.
Okay, and if you're hungry, don't order a pizza.
They don't screen those delivery guys.
Half of them are ex-cons.
Stop it. You're gonna scare him. It's gonna be fine.
But if you do choke, you've gotta throw yourself
against the back of a chair to get the food out.
He'll just drink stuff.
Nothing from under the sink.
Even if it's lemony?
I'm just messing with you.
In case of fire, go low and get out.
In case of earthquake --
Wait. You think there could be an earthquake?
The last time we had one, that big cabinet fell on me.
No, it didn't.
It did?!
Let's go.
Bye, honey, we love you.
Do you have the keys?
We're gonna check in. I promise!
Uhh, what's going on?
New suit?
This old thing?
Yes, it is.
I got it at this hipster place downtown.
You like it?
It's tight.
Well, the salesman said it was the style,
and he looked like a Mumford and Son,
so I think he'd know.
Mm, let's go.
Slow down, Flo Jo.
You know what? We don't have time for this.
I'll just change.
Well, now I feel bad. Let's both just change.
That's the fair thing to do.
Okay, fine. But quickly, pLemony Snicketlease.
I don't know.
It's blue.
Yeah, this one's so yellow.
Oh, you know what?
I have a stain on this one. I can't wear it.
Oh, paisley, yeah. I don't know.
Are you kidding me right now?!
What?
I know this trick, Cam.
You take forever to pick out an outfit,
knowing very well that I'll say, "Let's just go,"
because we're late.
Meantime, you get credit for offering to change
while I'm the one who actually does.
As usual.
Excuse me.
Are you accusing me of manipulating you to get my way?
Actually...
Because that's what my mother used to accuse me of,
and I got to say
that that brings up a lot of stuff with me.
You're crying without tears.
Give me a minute.
"'Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,'
"Grumbled Jo.
'it's so dreadful to be poor,' sighed --"
Stop! I hate this.
Can I put makeup on you?
Why does everyone ask me that?
Let's just have a good time tonight, all right?
I'm not mad.
Okay, good.
And you do look super-duper handsome in that.
Don't even.
I'm gonna grab a water for the road.
Yeah, get me a soda.
Okay, Alex. Thank you so much.
Have a fun night.
Honey, we love you.
Here you go.
All right. Thank you.
Okay, and remember, no eating in the living room.
Aah! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
What did you do? What did you do?!
Come on! You can't possibly think --
You shook this can
so you could wear the outfit that I wanted to wear?
That is exactly what I think!
That is insane.
You saw me take it from the refrigerator
and bring it to you.
Did I?
Or were you out of my sight for the two seconds
that it took you to get from the refrigerator to here,
which would have given you exactly the right amount of time
to shake the can?
Nice theory, Nancy Grace, but I'm not that petty.
Okay, you two. Did you see anything?
Just pretend you're coloring.
Okay, what are you doing?
I'm trying to reach the mirror.
I got something in my eye.
Hi, you've reached the Dunphys.
Why isn't Luke picking up?
It's hard to reach the phone
when you're tied up by a recently paroled pizza guy.
Ha ha. You're very funny.
What are you doing?
I know it sounds weird.
Call it mother's intuition,
but I just have this feeling that something is wrong.
Fine, do what you want,
but I've just about had it up to --
higher than here with this.
Die, pizza man!
Stop! Stop!
Oh. Sorry, mom.
Told you he could take care of himself.
Move.
Why does she do this?
We're gonna lose our table.
She knows how important it is to me to be on time.
This is torture.
I think you've lost perspective, Jay.
You know what I would give to wait around
for a woman like that?
Reel it in, creepy.
That's your mother up there.
Sorry, sorry.
Once I changed the earrings, I had to change the shoes.
And then I tried on one of Gloria's old dresses,
which made me feel like a 10-year-old boy.
Ay, your body's beautiful.
I agree.
Take it outside the family.
Okay, we ready to go?
Wait. I have the wrong lipstick.
Oh! That's it! I've had it!
Just one minute!
Nothing takes a minute with you.
We're leaving right now.
I don't care what you have to do.
It's bad enough you're being rude to me,
but you're being rude
to the people sitting there waiting for us!
Sorry, you're the first to arrive,
and we can't seat you till everyone's here.
I hope you're happy!
Where the hell is everybody?
Yes, I hate waiting like this.
Do you?
Just because everybody else is late
doesn't make it okay for us to be late.
I can't get ready fast with all the yelling!
I wasn't yelling.
You see, you're doing it again!
Gloria, you do this every single time.
If you know how long it takes you to get ready,
why don't you start earlier?
I have my reasons.
I would love to know them.
You're going to be mean.
I promise I won't be.
I like to make an entrance.
What's that, now?
I like the part where I go in,
and everybody's waiting for me,
and they say,
"Gloria, you look so pretty,
and that dress is so beautiful."
Is that so bad?
I don't love it.
Oh, this room is so nice.
I know. It's almost as gorgeous as -- you monster!
What? Oh, this?
Well, you know, you couldn't wear it,
so I figured, what's the harm?
Mm. Okay, you know what? I will go over there,
and I will be as socially magnetic as I always am.
We will put this on the back burner,
but underneath, I want you to know, I am fuming.
Hey, Jay, where's Gloria?
She's -- she was there a second --
There are my boys!
Gloria, you look so pretty.
That dress is so beautiful.
You got to be kidding me.
You let him watch those scary shows with you,
and then we leave him home alone at night.
Of course he's gonna arm himself.
He was fine until you gave him your "50 Ways to Die" speech.
What was the one about the welcome mat?
They are highly flammable.
For seven to ten people a year,
they may as well say, "Welcome to the morgue."
You know what? Drop it.
I don't want to fight in public.
It's embarrassing.
Fine.
Hi, how are you?
Good evening. Good.
Oh, my leg's asleep!
My leg's asleep! Okay, thank you.
Sir, if the rest of your party doesn't arrive soon,
we have to give up your table.
Any minute.
Again, dad, sorry we're late.
Yeah, you know, Mitchell put on some music,
and we were primping and dancing around,
and I guess, well, we just lost track of time.
Actually, dad, what happened
was Cam was practicing this trick
where he pretends to be accommodating
and then magically gets his way.
There they are.
We need a second.
Oh, Cam, no.
Where are you guys going?
Can't talk. Too mad.
Oh, God.
Hi, dad.
Where's Gloria?
She -- for the love of --
There you are!
Oh, my goodness! That dress!
Gloria, holy mackerel.
We're so sorry we're late.
We had to drop Luke off at your place.
Phil wanted him to stay home alone, but he got scared.
Man, I can't wait to get some food
in my mouth and yours.
Poor Haley.
What is she going to do with all those boys?
*I'll be with him*
*I know you will*
*On that midnight train to Georgia*
*Leaving on the midnight train to Georgia*
You know what?
I resent the implication that I always get my way.
Really? The "Save the date" cards.
For our wedding?
Oh. So, it is still our wedding.
I wasn't sure I was even invited
because you keep asking for my opinion
and then doing the exact opposite.
That's one thing.
What about the music?
I think our love deserves a band, not a D.J.
The tablecloths.
They make sneakers out of that fabric.
You won't let me pick one thing, and you want to know why?
Because I have better taste than you.
I was gonna say because you're a control freak.
And how can you think that I have bad taste?
We chose the exact same outfit.
Did we?
I wore fun loafers.
You wore sensible oxfords.
Your collar's buttoned down.
Mine's a more current widespread.
And I chose a bold pocket square
to bring out the stripe in the shirt,
all of which you wouldn't have thought of.
Because, well, I've already said.
You don't like my oxfords?
I'm sorry. I'm being harsh.
They're fine.
Thank you.
For a small-town detective.
Okay, look. I can't help myself. I did it again.
So, I-I don't love them.
But I do love you.
And I don't want you to feel left out.
Okay. Then let me have a say in planning our wedding.
That's what we agreed to.
You will, and you should, and I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Can you just do one thing for me?
Sure.
Just be honest, and I'll let this go forever.
Did you shake that can?
No.
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
See, Phil?
They don't let Manny stay home alone.
Why do you think Haley's there?
Actually, we let Manny stay home all the time,
and sometimes, he makes cupcakes,
which I could use one right about now --
or a potato.
Haley's there to take care of Joe.
Are you sure, guys?
'cause Claire's always right about everything
all the time, forever and ever.
Thank god. Here they are.
Fiona, we're all here.
Actually, dad, we could use a moment.
I'm going to eat my hand.
"Jo immediately sat up,
"put her hands in her pockets, and began to whistle.
"Don't, Jo. It's so boyish."
"That's why I do it."
"I detest rude, unladylike girls."
"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits."
Okay, this stinks. I give up.
Thank god.
Want to see your hair?
Lily, that's actually good.
Can you really do makeup?
Stay there.
Is it really too much to ask that you consult me
before you make such a big decision?
Claire, when you went back to work,
you asked me to take the reins.
So I think you need to trust me now.
Do you really think I'd put Luke in a dangerous situation?
He's my favorite, which I did not just say.
If anything happens to him...
It won't.
If you haven't noticed, I'm pretty good at this,
as hard as it is for you to pay me a compliment.
Where is that coming from?
Well, do you like this suit?
I wouldn't know
because all you said was, "It's tight,"
and not in a cool black way.
Wait, a-are you trying to say
that you squeezed yourself in that for me?
Yes.
You've been a little distracted at work,
so I wanted to look nice for you.
Oh, honey.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
You're right.
Luke probably would have been fine,
and I am having a hard time letting go.
And if there's one person in the world I trust, it is you.
And?
And...you look hot in that suit.
When we get home later...
Okay, you're actually gonna need to stop.
This suit can't get any tighter.
Hey, we're back.
Nobody goes anywhere.
Everybody hold hands, and we go right to the table.
Fiona?
Actually, we just gave away your table.
I'm sorry, but I did warn you about this.
Listen to me, Fiorina.
This man has been waiting
to eat in this restaurant for months!
We were all selfish, and we made him late.
And maybe I got a little crazy,
but I'm gonna think about that later.
But he has done nothing wrong!
So we're not gonna leave this place
until he eats that drunk cow
that he can't shut up his mouth about!
Why you haven't moved?
Last night, I had the greatest meal I've ever had,
and it never would have happened
if Gloria hadn't got us kicked out
of that snooty restaurant.
Tacos.
Tacos.
I need a taco.
Yes.
Taco truck!
That is delicious.
No, but seriously, who looks better?
I don't know if it was the six scotches I drank
waiting for everybody,
or the fact that I hadn't eaten anything since breakfast...
or the moment Phil's suit finally gave up.
They even played my favorite song.
*He's leaving*
*Leaving*
*On that midnight train to Georgia*
*Leaving on the midnight train*
*Said he's going back to find*
*Going back to find*
*the simpler place and time*
*Oh, yes, he is*
*And I'll be with him*
*Yes, he will*
*On that midnight train to Georgia*
A train I'd never make
unless I told Gloria it left at 11:00.
*I'd rather live in his world*
*than live without him in mine*
Here you go.
I didn't know what you wanted to drink,
so I just got you this soda.
That's fine. Thank you.
Cam, what did you do?
I did exactly what you did
because I know you so well.
I didn't shake the soda.
Then you have nothing to worry about,
so go ahead and open it.
I shook it, okay?
I shook the soda. I shook it up!
Are you happy?
It was petty and stupid and awful.
I'm sorry.
