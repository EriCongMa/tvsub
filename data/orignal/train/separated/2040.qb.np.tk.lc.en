mike ross never went to law school .
i knew it , and i hired him anyway .
i still can &apos;t stay , harvey .
i know .
i just want to stop lying to the people i love .
this makes it look like forstman &apos;s payment never
went to any offshore accounts .
that &apos;s forgery .
which is less of a crime than what you did .
i had no choice !
bullshit , you had no choice !
you could &apos;ve said no at any goddamn point along the way .
one thing is for sure .
when all this is over , i &apos;m gonna fire the shit out of you .
i went to robert zane
and i asked him to give louis a job .
you want to see if i can break my partnership agreement ?
if you can &apos;t do that ,
what the hell good are you ?
louis won &apos;t be going to zane ,
and neither will you .
i &apos;m here to ask you to take louis anyway .
and why would i do that ?
if you do it , i &apos;ll owe you one .
mike ross doesn &apos;t forget anything .
see , the reason he didn &apos;t recognize this
was because he didn &apos;t go to harvard .
you &apos;ve been lying to me since the day mike ross arrived .
i am your friend , louis .
no , you &apos;re not .
and don &apos;t you ever say that to me again .
so you might as well spit it out .
you asked me what i wanted once before and i told you .
and then you tole me i couldn &apos;t have it .
pearson .
specter
litt .
want to tell me what was so important
i had to get back here ?
he knows .
i know what you &apos;re thinking .
why didn &apos;t donna tell you ?
i &apos;ll tell you why .
because as my first official act as name as name partner ,
i told her not to .
what ?
you heard me .
you can look at her as long as you want .
she can &apos;t help you .
because my name &apos;s going up there first thing tomorrow .
no , it isn &apos;t .
yes , it is .
but it won &apos;t be tomorrow .
i &apos;m not waiting just so you can--
louis , i have to sell this to the senior partners .
i can &apos;t just slap your name up there one morning .
you did it for him .
i didn &apos;t resign the week before .
i don &apos;t care .
louis .
that &apos;s enough .
this is going to take time ,
and while it does , you &apos;re going to keep this to yourself .
bullshit . you &apos;re just trying to buy time so you can get out of this .
i &apos;m not trying to buy anything .
we have an agreement , and this is for your own good .
well , for your own good ,
you better remember what i &apos;ll do if this takes too long .
please tell me you had no other choice .
you know damn well i didn &apos;t .
no , i don &apos;t .
that &apos;s because you didn &apos;t see him .
all he &apos;s ever thought about since the day he was born
was getting this .
so if i have to choose between giving it to him
and going to jail--
he really threatened that ?
he didn &apos;t just threaten it .
he was going to do it .
and what are we going to do ?
we &apos;re going to take it .
we give him this , it is never gonna end .
harvey , before you say another word to me ,
i want you to think about the fact
that i just ate a big bowl of shit
because you brought that kid into my house .
and i had to take it ,
so you &apos;re going to take it .
harvey .
you don &apos;t need to say it .
yeah , i do .
louis came looking for you , and i didn &apos;t know what to do .
he was gonna call sheila and tell her everything .
i &apos;d never seen him like that before .
donna , this is not on you .
yes , it is .
he pressed me , and i broke .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because he already knew .
how can you know that ?
because i know louis , and i know you .
and he couldn &apos;t have broken you
unless he knew the truth already .
so this is not your fault ,
and i never want to hear you say that again .
i should &apos;ve at least warned you before you got here .
all that would have done was antagonize him even more
because he would &apos;ve known you did it .
you did everything you could &apos;ve done .
okay .
we have to tell mike .
no , we don &apos;t . not now .
harvey .
look , i &apos;ll tell him in the morning .
we just had a huge win ,
and i am not in the mood to ruin his night .
louis .
what are you doing here ?
they didn &apos;t tell you .
tell me what ?
jessica made me name partner .
but , uh--
but ? but ?
but what ?
i resigned in shame ?
well , that &apos;s all changed , and it &apos;s all because of you .
remember this ?
no , you don &apos;t ,
because you can &apos;t remember something you never knew .
cool to the end .
well , it doesn &apos;t matter , because donna told me .
and harvey .
and jessica .
when i told them that i knew you were a fraud ,
did they run from you like you were the plague .
what do you want ?
i already got what i wanted from you .
name partner .
you must want something else .
otherwise , you wouldn &apos;t be here .
see , that &apos;s what i love about you , mike .
almost always a step ahead .
what i want from you
is to know that you &apos;re dead at my law firm .
you can &apos;t fire me .
why would i fire you when i can break you ?
you see , i &apos;m going to bury you under a mountain of shit so big
you &apos;re going to be begging me to take it off .
and all you have to do is say two simple words--
the same two words that you let me say
to harvey and jessica .
&quot; i resign . &quot;
louis .
what are you doing here ?
leaving .
that way i don &apos;t have to look at either one of you two liars .
oh , my god , he knows .
he doesn &apos;t just know .
he &apos;s a name partner .
you know .
yeah , i know .
and a little heads up would &apos;ve been nice .
i wanted to give you the night .
well , the night kind of got blown up
when louis showed up at my apartment
and said he was gonna break me .
what do you want from me , mike ?
i want to know how you let him become name partner .
would you rather we let him go to the police ?
come on . i don &apos;t believe that louis would actually go to the police .
he would because jessica said he would .
so if you &apos;re here to say
that we can figure some way out of it ,
that &apos;s not going to happen .
he knows , and it &apos;s done .
did you hear what i said ?
louis came to my apartment filled with rage ,
and he told me he was making it
his personal mission to break me .
then you make it your mission not to let him .
harvey , he &apos;s name partner .
did i ever tell you the story about the gym ?
i &apos;m not really in the mood for a story right now .
then you &apos;re going to hear it anyway .
when i was a kid , my father put me in boxing camp .
middle of summer , 90 degrees .
every day after sparring in that ,
they &apos;d make you do 100 laps and 50 pull @-@ ups .
they &apos;d push you until you either threw up
or passed out or both .
anyone could leave at any point .
all you had to do was quit .
and let me guess , you didn &apos;t quit .
i quit every goddamn day .
i just never said it out loud .
because no way was i gonna give them
the satisfaction of breaking me .
so i guess it &apos;s time for me to drop down and give louis 20 .
i think it &apos;s gonna be a little more than 20 , buddy .
i see you noticed i scraped your little associate title away .
you scraped it away ?
yeah , just like i &apos;m gonna scrape you away ,
starting with these .
oh , louis , go ahead .
give me all of the shittiest cases that you can find ,
but i &apos;m telling you ,
it &apos;s not gonna break me .
you overestimate yourself .
did you think when i said i was going to bury you in shit ,
i meant legal work ?
no , no , no .
you &apos;re not a lawyer ,
which means you must be a paralegal ,
and that &apos;s exactly the kind of work you &apos;re gonna be doing .
louis , you can &apos;t do this .
everyone out there thinks of me as a lawyer .
and two days ago , they thought of me
as someone who used to work here .
look at us now .
oh , and if you &apos;re thinking of crying to harvey .
that would be a major mistake ,
because this is between you and me .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m here because i know you &apos;re angry
and you &apos;re feeling betrayed , but i am not gonna let you
throw our friendship away .
i can &apos;t throw away something
that never existed in the first place .
louis--
donna , we &apos;re not friends .
we were never friends , because it was all based on a lie .
so you think my giving you this
and every other nice thing that i ever did for you
was just to keep you from finding out about mike ?
no , i don &apos;t .
but i do think if you had the chance
to take back all those nice things you did
in exchange for me never finding out about your little secret ,
you &apos;d do it in a heartbeat .
you want a chance to tell me the truth ?
go ahead . tell me the truth right now .
and that answers my question .
you know what , louis ?
it was a bullshit question
designed to do nothing but make me feel like shit .
mission accomplished .
and now i &apos;m gonna tell you what i told mike .
you &apos;re dead to me .
okay .
you want to hate me ? hate me .
you want to hate mike ? hate mike .
but everybody at this firm can &apos;t be dead to you ,
because sooner or later , you &apos;re going to need someone .
thank you , donna ,
but that someone isn &apos;t going to be you .
donna said you wanted to see me .
no , i didn &apos;t want to see you ,
i needed to see you .
i know you &apos;re under a lot of stress ,
but that was a one @-@ time thing .
i don &apos;t need you to do that to me .
louis has already done it .
what are you talking about ?
look at this .
he &apos;s buried me in paralegal work .
okay , that &apos;s bullshit . he can &apos;t treat you like that .
rachel , i don &apos;t care how he treats me , all right ?
i can take it until he gets over this .
but look at these deadlines .
there &apos;s no way i can get all of this work done
on time without your help .
i will do whatever you need , but , mike ,
he is not going to get over it until you make him get over it .
rachel , please--
mike .
the day after what happened in here happened ,
i shut you out .
but then , a week later , you came to my door ,
and you said you weren &apos;t gonna let me go without a fight .
that is not the same .
i wanted you to fall in love with me .
i was already in love with you , and you knew it .
yeah , well , louis is a lot of things ,
but he &apos;s not in love with me .
he used to be .
you just have to make him remember that .
okay , the first thing we need to do
is finish all of this work .
okay .
unless , of course , that offer still stands .
i don &apos;t recall making an offer .
you did say whatever i need .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
and then you said never take no for an answer , so ...
lock the doors .
are you serious--
take yes for an answer .
i &apos;m locking the door .
louis , you sounded urgent on the phone .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s going on .
i &apos;m back at pearson specter .
what ?
i don &apos;t understand .
let me explain it to you .
i just became name partner .
louis , this is amazing .
i &apos;m so happy for you .
okay , well , you can keep being happy for me ,
but you better start being happy for you ,
because i &apos;m bringing you back .
what ? i--oh .
katrina amanda bennett ,
will you be my associate ?
louis marlowe litt ,
i will be your associate .
again .
you &apos;ve just made me the happiest attorney on earth .
when do we consummate our new preexisting relationship ?
as soon as my new position is official .
wait , why isn &apos;t it official ?
i can &apos;t tell you that .
louis , i think i &apos;ve more than proven you can trust me .
oh , are you kidding me ?
you &apos;re the only one i can trust .
it &apos;s not that . it &apos;s just--
okay , louis , you don &apos;t need to tell me .
but if you won &apos;t tell me , and they won &apos;t tell the world ,
something &apos;s wrong .
katrina , i know what i &apos;m doing .
and jessica knows what she &apos;s doing ,
which is playing you for a fool .
harvey , i was just gonna call you .
i &apos;ll save you the trouble .
we &apos;re bringing louis litt back to the firm .
that doesn &apos;t matter .
because that call was to tell you
i &apos;m hiring him , and you owe me .
bullshit .
you calling me a liar ?
i &apos;m not calling you anything ,
but you are calling sylvia out there a liar .
oh , no , no , sylvia wouldn &apos;t tell you shit .
wrong .
one compliment about her hair ,
and she told me you gave louis the bad news an hour ago .
see you around , robert .
harvey , one more thing .
you do still owe me that favor .
what kind of math are you doing ?
the kind of math that says jessica pearson
hiring louis litt back adds up to shady .
if that &apos;s all you &apos;ve got , you can collect your favor
when the clock strikes kiss my ass ,
because partners leave firms and come back all the time .
maybe , but they don &apos;t come back with their name on the wall .
ah , i &apos;m guessing he wasn &apos;t supposed to tell me that .
but he did , and louis litt is not name partner material ,
which means he must have something on you .
so unless you want me going around town
flapping my big mouth that something isn &apos;t right in your kitchen ,
you &apos;re gonna make good on that favor .
sylvia didn &apos;t slip up at all , did she ?
no , she didn &apos;t .
you have your girl friday ; i have mine .
but you can still tell her how nice her hair looks
on the way out .
i &apos;ll be in touch .
oh , you &apos;re tapping out already ?
i thought you &apos;d have a lot more backbone than that .
i &apos;m not tapping out .
i finished all of the work ...
which i expected to be done an hour ago .
come on , louis , you didn &apos;t expect it to be done at all .
just like you didn &apos;t expect this .
what the hell is that ?
it &apos;s a gift certificate .
what , are you trying to bribe me now ?
it &apos;s not a bribe , it &apos;s a reminder .
look , the gift certificate is from peter &apos;s steak house ,
the place that you and i saved together .
and after we saved it ,
you told me that we had something in common .
yeah , i don &apos;t give a shit .
yes , you do ,
because what we had in common
was a love of the law .
you told me that when you asked me
to be your associate , louis , and i am still the same person .
and if i found out a woman i had something in common with
was actually a man , i wouldn &apos;t keep seeing her .
okay , what i did is not at all the same thing .
no , it &apos;s worse .
you say you love the law so much ,
but every single case you &apos;ve ever touched is tainted .
so you get exposed , peter &apos;s gets bulldozed .
it wouldn &apos;t even be there to get bulldozed
if you and i hadn &apos;t worked together .
all right , genius . you want to work together ?
you love the law so much ?
you &apos;re gonna memorize every case that i &apos;ve ever done .
louis .
no , get to work ,
and use that magnificent memory of yours
for something more than
bullshitting your way through life .
we have a problem .
unless it &apos;s urgent , i don &apos;t have the time .
louis is telling people .
what people ?
for starters , robert zane .
why the hell is louis even talking to robert zane ?
i asked him to hire louis after we took back versalife .
and you didn &apos;t think to tell me that after last night ?
i was handling it .
from what i can tell , you handled it like shit .
so this is my fault ?
well , it sure as hell isn &apos;t mine .
you know what , jessica , i &apos;m not the one
who wanted to fire louis ,
and i &apos;m not the one who wanted to deny him clients .
i did that because of his performance as an attorney .
you antagonized him for years for your own pleasure .
tell yourself whatever you want .
you handed out your share of abuse .
tell yourself whatever you want .
you &apos;re the one who hired a fraud and gave louis leverage .
and i told you louis would get worse ,
and you said i had to take it .
well , i don &apos;t care whose fault it is ,
he is getting worse , and i &apos;m not gonna take it .
oh , yes , you are .
you &apos;re going to take it ,
and you &apos;re gonna do it with a smile on your face
until i say otherwise .
and what the hell are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m going to clean up this mess once and for all .
what do you mean , you don &apos;t have diamond @-@ encrusted business cards ?
fine , what about the embossed ivory ?
okay , great , well , how much would 10,000 of those run me ?
money &apos;s no object .
what , are you crazy ? i &apos;m not paying that much .
unless it comes with a reach @-@ around .
which , by the way , i &apos;m still not paying that much .
elite printing , my ass .
i give you one simple instruction ...
to keep your mouth shut ... and you couldn &apos;t even do that .
um , okay , did you make an appointment with norma ?
what ?
to see me .
did you check with my secretary , norma ?
cut the shit , louis . i &apos;m not in the mood .
well , get in the mood , because i hold all the cards .
and those cards are getting you your name on the wall ,
but you need to keep this to yourself .
why ?
so you can figure out a way to screw me ?
i gave you my word .
well , no disrespect , jessica , but your word means shit .
so if you want me to stop telling people ,
you better start telling people yourself .
i told you , in good time .
and i just told you i don &apos;t give a shit .
so i suggest you call a meeting with the senior partners .
those meetings are on thursdays .
well , consider today thursday .
i told you , i have yet to figure out how to sell it .
you want to sell it ? i &apos;ll tell you how to sell it .
you and harvey do it together ,
you do it like you mean it . and you do it now .
got it ? good .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve all heard rumors
about why we called this meeting ,
but that &apos;s because it &apos;s hard to keep good news quiet .
we &apos;ll be making this official later this week
but we &apos;re here to announce our newest name partner ,
louis litt .
thank you , jessica .
harvey .
some of you may be wondering how this happened .
there &apos;s a simple explanation ,
and all it requires is for me to admit something .
i made a mistake .
i never should have accepted louis &apos;s resignation ,
because not only is he a billing machine
and a damn good attorney ,
he has personally gotten me out of more than one jam ,
and there &apos;s no one i &apos;d rather have my name next to
than my friend louis litt .
thank you , harvey .
even though it &apos;s &quot; not official , &quot; i already feel like
my name &apos;s been up there as long as yours .
and i definitely feel like
it &apos;s gonna be up there for a long , long time .
a lot of good that did .
leave it to louis to take his big moment like a dick .
harvey , calm down .
calm down ?
i just did exactly what he wanted ,
and he acted like a dick , and he &apos;s not gonna stop .
he &apos;s not gonna stop because you didn &apos;t do what he wanted .
jessica , i just got up there and kissed his ass
in front of the entire partnership
and pretended to like it .
exactly .
pretended .
oh , you want me to actually like it ?
i want you to make him feel accepted .
jessica .
harvey , what louis wants is to be accepted .
and like it or not , the person
he wants that from the most is you .
so you &apos;re gonna go to him , you &apos;re gonna make nice ,
and that &apos;s how we &apos;re gonna put all of this to bed .
you want to tell me what the hell that was ?
if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i &apos;m gonna let jessica handle this conversation .
i have to go kill myself .
jeff , i can &apos;t do this right now .
should i make an appointment ?
because the partners may have bought that fairy tale
about louis &apos;s triumphant return , but they don &apos;t know what i know .
what exactly is that ?
that louis committed a crime ,
and then he resigned five seconds
before you were about to fire him .
and now he &apos;s not only back , he &apos;s name partner .
i reconsidered , which , as managing partner ,
i am entitled to do .
and as someone with a brain , i &apos;m entitled
to come to the conclusion that louis has something on you .
jeff , you said you didn &apos;t want me to lie to you anymore ,
and i &apos;m trying like hell not to .
and that &apos;s the same thing as lying to me .
no , it &apos;s not .
oh , you are one hell of a lawyer .
so are you , which is why you &apos;re here .
so i &apos;ll come clean .
i can &apos;t tell you the truth about this ,
and that &apos;s as honest as i can be with you right now .
can you handle that ?
i can handle it for now .
but i won &apos;t handle it forever .
louis , what are you doing here ?
i noticed you haven &apos;t congratulated me yet ,
so i wanted to give you a chance to make up for it .
right , congratulations . we &apos;re all so happy for you .
is that what you wanted ?
seemed a little disingenuous .
then let me be clear .
i don &apos;t mean a word of it .
you really want to talk that way to a new name partner ?
i &apos;m talking to you that way
because you threatened to throw the man that i love in jail
to become that name partner .
so , you know what , louis ,
i &apos;m sorry that i didn &apos;t bake you a cake .
that &apos;s too bad .
you didn &apos;t do anything for me ,
but i got something for you .
doc review .
filings to be done in triplicate .
paralegal work , since you like doing it so much .
you know i don &apos;t like doing it at all .
you helped your boyfriend with his work .
you didn &apos;t think i &apos;d figure that out ?
you know what ? i don &apos;t care .
you have no authority over me .
i &apos;m harvey &apos;s associate .
yeah , but i run the associates .
therefore , i run you .
i know what you &apos;re doing .
but do you know what you &apos;re doing ?
not only do you live with a fraud ,
you &apos;re just like him--
pretending to be a lawyer when you &apos;re not .
i &apos;m not pretending to be anything .
i am in law school .
are you really gonna make it through ?
you could barely handle the lsats .
you couldn &apos;t get into harvard .
as a matter of fact , your boyfriend may be a fraud ,
but he &apos;s a better lawyer than you &apos;ll ever be .
you have no idea what kind of lawyer i &apos;m gonna be .
don &apos;t i ?
you learned from the best liars around , rachel
harvey , mike ,
your father .
yeah , i know exactly the kind of lawyer you &apos;re gonna be .
but until that day , this kind of work
is all you &apos;re good for .
so you like marinated meat ?
oh , yum .
okay , wait , but which one do you make ?
kansas city or memphis style ?
oh , hell , when it comes to ribs ,
i make &apos; em every which way i can .
i am now officially starving .
harvey .
please have a seat .
don &apos;t let my law firm get in the way of your coffee klatch .
oh , now , now , don &apos;t blame donna here .
i told her you and i had some unfinished business .
already ?
what , did you pick something out of your generic favor file ?
i &apos;ve never done anything generic in my life .
this favor is tailor @-@ made for you .
it &apos;s very specific and very personal .
we &apos;re in a little dispute with another firm .
i need you to get them to back off of it .
why can &apos;t you do it yourself ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t know the lawyer on the other side .
you do . good luck .
what the hell is he talking about ?
it &apos;s scottie .
aw , shit .
i know .
scottie doesn &apos;t do favors like this ,
and i don &apos;t have any leverage on her .
yeah , you do .
you &apos;re just not gonna like using it .
hey , there you are .
look , i just finished memorizing all of louis &apos;s cases ,
and i had an idea i wanted to run by--
rachel , what happened ?
nothing happened .
what did louis do ?
it &apos;s nothing .
he found out that i helped you ,
and now he &apos;s giving me paralegal work ,
and i was a little upset , but now i &apos;m okay .
you weren &apos;t just a little upset .
you were crying ,
and a little paralegal work wouldn &apos;t do that .
it is not important .
and you know what ? i had it coming .
you had it coming ?
what are you-- rachel , what did he do ?
mike , i was the one that told you to make up with him .
rachel .
i helped you with the work .
what did he do ?
and you know what ?
i lied to him as much as you did .
what did he do ?
it &apos;s not what he did , it &apos;s what he said .
what did he say ?
mike , i &apos;m a big girl ,
and i can take care of louis .
this isn &apos;t about you ,
this is about me and him ,
and i &apos;m gonna make him remember that .
you piece of shit .
you said this was between me and you .
it is between me and you .
no , it stopped being between me and you
the second you went to rachel .
you put her between us
the second you went to her to help you .
god , are you insane ?
rachel has never been anything but kind to you .
i can &apos;t even count the amount of times
that she defended you .
and now , she tries to help me just a little bit ,
and you rip her to pieces .
no , that &apos;s not the help i &apos;m talking about , fraud .
then what the hell are you talking about ?
you went to her to help you lie to me about who you are ,
and like the good little lackey that she is ,
she came to me and lied to my face .
she did it to protect me , louis .
well , good for you ,
but when i found out about it ,
i felt like shit for the 180th time .
so i just went to her and did the same thing .
you know , louis , i &apos;ve just been memorizing
all of your old arguments .
i was actually gonna try and come in here
and use one of them to change your mind about me .
it won &apos;t work .
oh , i know .
because while i am the same person that i was before ,
you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m not the same person .
i used to be a man of my word ,
but you people taught me that doesn &apos;t mean a thing .
so when i told you
it was between me and you , i lied .
i found your weak spot ,
and you know what i &apos;m gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna keep hammering on her
until you break .
jessica .
please , if it can wait , i &apos;ve had a long day ,
and i need to go home .
too bad .
you &apos;re staying here
and drafting louis litt &apos;s new partnership agreement .
so now you &apos;re piling on too now ?
i &apos;m not piling on .
i am giving you this because it &apos;s non @-@ billable work
and the only reason it exists is because of you .
this again ?
excuse me ?
you heard me .
i &apos;ve seen this movie before .
and the reason it keeps rerunning
is because every time i think i &apos;m done with you ,
you and your dirty little secret rear your ugly heads .
you know what , jessica ?
i have had it up to here
with you saying that this is my dirty little secret .
you could have fired me when you found out , and you didn &apos;t .
no , you decided to keep me around
because you were more concerned
with beating daniel hardman and keeping your power .
and then you kept me around
because you didn &apos;t want to lose harvey .
and then you wanted to use my secret to beat harvey ,
and then again and again and again .
so please , jessica , why don &apos;t you tell me ,
when the hell does this become your dirty little secret ?
this seat taken ?
hi .
hey .
since your message was so cryptic ,
i &apos;m assuming this is about business .
i need a favor .
hey , scottie .
how are you ?
how have you been since you left ?
i heard that you took some time off .
where did you land ?
i need you to settle your case against robert zane .
and why would i do that ?
because i owe him one .
harvey , i &apos;m just getting back on my feet at a new firm .
this case is winnable .
the firm knows that it is because i told them it is .
i settle , i look like shit .
i know that , but you came to me once
to take it easy on you with folsom foods--
because you said if i was ever in trouble personally--
i am in trouble personally .
what the hell is personal about robert zane ?
you don &apos;t do this for me ,
zane &apos;s going to put it together about mike ross .
you selfish son of a bitch .
you said you told me that
because you didn &apos;t want to keep lying to the people you love .
i didn &apos;t want to .
and now you come to me trading on the fact
that i know to get you out of a jam
for doing something stupid and selfish
that drove a wedge between us
before we ever even had a chance .
i told you the truth .
after it was too late .
scottie .
i loved you .
i loved you ,
and you let some stupid secret that i would never tell anyone
come between us because you couldn &apos;t trust me with it .
you &apos;re right , scottie .
i don &apos;t have a leg to stand on .
but if you don &apos;t do this for me , i am in trouble .
i &apos;m going to recommend we settle with robert zane .
thank you .
but to be clear ,
you get to ask me this once .
and i never want to hear the name mike ross again .
scottie--
once .
you wanted it to be official .
there it is , louis .
it &apos;s official .
so that &apos;s it ?
people are just gonna walk in here tomorrow morning
like it &apos;s any other day and see it or maybe not see it ?
what were you expecting ?
a ceremony and a brass band ?
we don &apos;t do that .
well , i &apos;m name partner , and i say we do now .
excuse me ?
you heard me .
i want pomp and circumstance in the form of an unveiling .
i &apos;m going home , louis .
i &apos;m not spending the rest of the night
emailing invitations to an unveiling .
you &apos;re going home ?
well , then i &apos;ll send them out myself .
because tomorrow ...
this is happening .
4 p.m. sharp .
i have a meeting at 4 : 00 .
then reschedule it .
you don &apos;t want me to reschedule .
what you want is to know you &apos;ve earned that .
i have earned it ,
but i want you to know it .
okay , here it is .
you got your name up there by finding leverage
and using it to strong @-@ arm me into doing something
that i never would have done .
see , i knew you--
let me finish .
it was a stone @-@ cold move ,
and it &apos;s exactly what harvey would have done .
now , if that doesn &apos;t tell you that you &apos;ve earned it ,
then i don &apos;t know what will .
you still want me to reschedule my meeting ?
yes , i do .
fine . i &apos;ll be there .
you and harvey .
of course , louis .
we &apos;re your partners .
jesus , you look like shit .
what &apos;s going on ?
between drafting louis &apos;s partnership agreement
for jessica and louis &apos;s never @-@ ending onslaught ,
i didn &apos;t get any sleep .
well , splash some water on your face ,
&apos;cause we have to go to his debutante ball
and look like we give a shit .
no . i &apos;m not going .
what do you mean you &apos;re not going ?
now is not the time to poke the bear .
it &apos;s too late .
the bear is an asshole ,
and he &apos;s not just taking it out on me anymore .
he &apos;s taking it out on rachel .
what ?
yeah , he made it clear that he found the weak spot
that &apos;s going to get to me , and he &apos;s gonna
keep pressing it and pressing it until i can &apos;t take it anymore .
mike , you are not ringing that bell .
you &apos;re damn right i &apos;m not ringing that bell .
but if i have to go raise a glass to that son of a bitch ,
i &apos;m gonna end up smashing it over his head .
come with me .
what are you going to do ?
enough is enough .
harvey . you &apos;re just in time .
jessica &apos;s on her way down with the partnership agreement .
you here to be my witness ?
he &apos;s here to keep me from ripping your face off .
oh , i see . now that big brother &apos;s here--
okay , that &apos;s enough .
louis , you got everything you wanted ,
and you are done taking it out on him ,
because no matter what you do , i &apos;m not letting him quit .
then i &apos;ll just fire him .
you can &apos;t .
i can , and i will ,
because jessica would rather he be fired
than you all go to jail .
no one &apos;s going to jail .
see ? she knows what &apos;s what .
i sign the agreement , he &apos;s done ,
and then i bring katrina back as my associate .
and that &apos;s not going to happen .
what are you talking about ?
louis , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ve made your last dictate to me
as name partner .
i &apos;m not gonna let you take this away from me .
i &apos;m not taking anything away from you .
you are still name partner .
right after you sign this .
i added a little something extra after you finished drafting it .
this says i &apos;m coconspirator to hiring a fraud .
you are .
you became one
the second you used him to get your name on the door .
i know i &apos;m not a real lawyer ,
but that sounds like he is to me .
i am a real lawyer .
he is .
i &apos;m not signing it .
louis , here &apos;s the thing .
i told you not to tell anybody about this ,
and then you went and you shouted it to robert zane ,
and then you made me tell the partners .
and the capper is , there are about a hundred people
waiting to greet you
after the unveiling you arranged ,
which won &apos;t happen if you don &apos;t sign that .
i could still go to the police .
yeah , you could , but you won &apos;t .
&apos;cause you used that little secret
to get where you are right now .
it was the only bullet in your chamber ,
and i am taking your gun away .
you set me up .
you set yourself up ,
just like you did with charles forstman .
and what i learned from him
was once you get something that you want ,
you will do whatever it takes to keep it .
so why don &apos;t you go ahead and sign
so we can get out to your goddamn party .
you know , it &apos;s funny .
we &apos;ve never had a ceremony when we &apos;ve changed names before ,
but louis litt had the audacity to convene us all here today .
and as it turns out ,
his first decision as name partner is brilliant ,
because a ceremony like this gives us a chance
to reevaluate where we &apos;ve been and where we &apos;re going .
perhaps you had a disagreement with a colleague ,
or there &apos;s some other issue that &apos;s been on your mind .
the point is , with a new name comes a new beginning .
for me , i &apos;m hoping we can see this as a chance
to wipe the slate clean .
with that said ,
here &apos;s to our newest name partner , louis litt .
nice speech .
let &apos;s hope it takes .
it &apos;s got a better chance of taking
now that you made him sign the agreement .
that it does .
speaking of which ,
when exactly did you know you were gonna do that ?
about 15 seconds after donna told me he knew .
and you didn &apos;t feel the need to bring me in on that plan ?
i felt the exact opposite .
what are you talking about ?
harvey , louis wanted to see you suffer .
if i had told you , you would have had to fake it ,
and you &apos;re a shitty actor .
excuse me , but i can act .
no , everybody thinks they can act , harvey .
the fact of the matter is , well , you &apos;re just a pretty face .
you think i &apos;m pretty ?
pretty stupid .
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s actually up there .
this firm is changing names more than prince .
who ?
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
purple rain .
raspberry beret .
i &apos;m kidding .
i almost had to reevaluate our entire relationship .
after you were gonna go and beat louis up for me ?
i doubt that .
mike , thank you .
it just seemed right .
after all , you stood up to louis for me .
and i almost got pummeled for it .
that took guts .
and that &apos;s why i love you .
i love you too .
i wanted to tell you that you were right .
i started this whole thing by hiring mike .
it &apos;s my fault .
thank you .
but i &apos;ve been on board long enough ,
and it &apos;s time i accepted the fact
that it &apos;s my secret too .
so where do we go from here ?
we fight like hell to protect it .
no cake ?
what are you doing here , jessica ?
i know you &apos;re tired of waiting for an explanation ,
so i &apos;m here to give you one .
you &apos;ve given me explanations before .
i want the truth .
are you ready for the truth ?
because it &apos;s not pretty .
there &apos;s only one way to find out .
it seems like forever ago ,
but it wasn &apos;t that long ago at all .
daniel hardman embezzled money from the firm ,
and i covered it up .
now , make no mistake ,
i found about it , i confronted him ,
and i eventually made him pay it all back .
but i did cover it up .
from the partners , from the police , from everyone .
i even adjusted our books to hide the crime .
and being a bloodhound about these things , louis found out
and used it as leverage to come back .
as name partner .
as name partner .
why couldn &apos;t you trust me with that before ?
because i didn &apos;t know how you &apos;d react ,
and i didn &apos;t want to risk losing everything i had .
jessica ,
your secret is safe with me .
you &apos;re late .
but i come bearing gifts .
that doesn &apos;t look like cannoli .
it &apos;s better than cannoli , dad .
it &apos;s the resume of your new associate .
if this is harvey &apos;s way of trying to make up for the fact
that i didn &apos;t hire louis--
this isn &apos;t from harvey . it &apos;s from me .
and you &apos;re going to do this for me ,
and i am not going to owe you a thing .
this is what they &apos;re teaching you at columbia ?
because that &apos;s not how favors work .
i know how favors work .
you do this , and then you want something from me someday .
but by then you &apos;re going to understand that right now
i &apos;m the one doing you a favor ,
because katrina bennett is an amazing lawyer .
i was wrong about you .
you &apos;re not like your mother .
you &apos;re like your father .
come on .
oh , that &apos;s good .
that was a good one .
that was a good one .
sounds just like me , baby girl .
i had you fooled , huh ?
you did .
now let me show you how a lawyer cooks .
what do you want ?
i just thought you &apos;d want this .
the associates saved it for you .
no , they didn &apos;t .
you saved it for me
because you want to pretend to be my friend again .
louis , didn &apos;t you hear jessica &apos;s speech ?
this is our chance wipe the slate clean .
i did hear her speech ,
and i know that she sent you here to say that to me .
no one sent me here .
i &apos;m here because i want to be here .
you see , that &apos;s sweet .
but how can i ever believe a word you say ?
i want to know if you ever thought once
to tell me the truth about mike .
no , i didn &apos;t .
of course you didn &apos;t .
because we &apos;re not friends .
you &apos;re wrong .
we are friends ,
but my professional loyalty to harvey comes above that ,
which is why i never told anyone--
jessica , rachel , anyone .
so put yourself in my position and ask yourself ,
what you would have done ?
i want you to tell me something else .
yes . anything .
you ever sleep with harvey ?
wait . what ?
it &apos;s not a professional question .
it &apos;s a personal question .
can you put our so @-@ called friendship high enough
to answer that one honestly ?
louis--
because it &apos;s the only thing i can think of
to know if i can even begin to trust you again .
once .
that &apos;s my way of wiping the slate clean .
you can accept it or not .
