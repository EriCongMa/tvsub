my father was an innocent man ,
destroyed by powerful people .
the graysons are behind this , and they &apos;re gonna pay .
i &apos;ve dedicated my life to avenging his death .
eventually , someone &apos;s gonna find you out .
and i won &apos;t stop until they &apos;ve all paid the price .
i pronounce you man and wife .
i suspect you &apos;re about as pregnant as i am .
this photo proves that
you &apos;ve been targeting my family and my son for years .
good @-@ bye , victoria .
two minutes and then fire .
i heard everything . you set me up .
why did you tell me i was gonna be a father ? !
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , my god . where &apos;s emily ?
she should &apos;ve beat me to the beach ten minutes ago .
emily thorne is still missing at sea .
former governor grayson and his immediately family
are being questioned by authorities
at the hamptons coast guard facility .
now few details are known at this point ,
格雷森家族海边危机
but what has been confirmed is
socialite emily thorne has disappeared
during her honeymoon cruise with publisher daniel grayson .
now a grayson family spokesperson says
all parties are cooperating fully with authorities .
and so far , there is no word yet on suspects or a motive .
oh , my god . nolan , what happened ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
i just found out .
oh , god . nolan , i &apos;m so sorry .
what can i do to help ?
i don &apos;t know .
uh , i &apos;m gonna go find victoria .
i &apos;ll call if i get any--any information .
uh , keep in touch ?
yeah , i will .
okay . all right .
here &apos;s to you , ems ,
and well @-@ laid plans .
no !
i had emily &apos;s signal for a moment . now it &apos;s gone .
i thought you said
you could track her anywhere on the planet ?
the transmitter may have been broken in the fall .
i have to go find her .
hold on . the currents could have taken her anywhere .
do you understand that ?
you saw her dress ! she was shot twice !
and she &apos;ll need to treat her wounds ,
so she &apos;ll go to the channel marker ,
because we left an emergency case there .
i don &apos;t understand how this could &apos;ve happened .
emily plans for every last detail .
i thought we &apos;d prepared for all the variables ,
but it turns out we were lying to ourselves
in order to meet that damn deadline of hers .
it &apos;s all my fault .
no . it &apos;s mine .
what are you talking about ?
i gave her that deadline .
i told her that if she didn &apos;t finish this ,
i would expose who she really was .
what ?
i just wanted her to stop .
it &apos;s her . she &apos;s got it working again .
go to ross , tell him what happened .
you wait for me there . i may need both of you .
go !
i was governor of this state ,
so don &apos;t tell me what can &apos;t be done .
i want more choppers in the air , and i want them now .
okay .
we &apos;re gonna find emily , charlotte .
i &apos;m using all the resources at my disposal .
you know , i don &apos;t get it .
someone close to us shot emily .
i know exactly where you were , and daniel .
but mom ?
just let the police do their jobs .
all right , sweetheart ?
i hate to ask , mr. grayson ,
but i need to establish your whereabouts
at the time of the shooting .
he was with his family .
we were watching a wedding video in the main cabin .
i @-@ i &apos;d be much obliged
if you could offer this young man a moment alone .
we &apos;re gonna find her , son .
my photographer and i were covering the honeymoon
for &quot; voulez . &quot;
we were in the main room with the family
when the captain sounded the alarm .
and who was with you at that time ?
i don &apos;t know . there was so much confusion .
uh , but perhaps these might help .
they &apos;re photos of the event .
hundreds of them .
am i free to go now ?
yes , ms. lemarchal .
uh , but please don &apos;t speak of this investigation with anyone .
no , no . of course .
and why weren &apos;t you listed
on the official manifest , ms. davis ?
i was a late addition .
conrad .
can you tell this overblown hall monitor
that i was sitting with you when emily was shot ?
i can confirm her statement .
but thanks for your diligence , officer .
i had hoped that lying to the authorities
was not gonna be a component of this relationship .
do you mind sharing where you actually were ?
i didn &apos;t do this , conrad . honestly .
i was waiting for you in our cabin .
but since no one can confirm that ,
i didn &apos;t want to risk telling that to the police .
we finally have a second chance at a life together .
i don &apos;t want anything getting in the way of that .
neither do i.
we found shell casings on the deck , mrs. grayson .
that means somebody onboard shot your daughter @-@ in @-@ law .
and yet , i can &apos;t seem to get you to tell me
exactly where you were when all this happened .
i don &apos;t appreciate your tone , detective .
well , i &apos;m sorry , mrs. grayson .
but when a witness refuses to cooperate ,
my antenna goes up .
i am not the shooter .
let &apos;s leave it at that and move on .
all right .
let &apos;s discuss the public feuds you &apos;ve had with the victim .
not without my lawyer .
i need to get you to a hospital .
don &apos;t take me back .
let &apos;s just go .
like we wanted to .
if i don &apos;t get you help , you &apos;re going to die .
do you understand ?
i just want ...
i wanna be with you .
okay . okay .
emily . em .
emily , you stay with me .
emily ?
oh , god .
mayday ! mayday ! mayday !
everything fell apart .
aiden said that victoria even knew about the fake pregnancy .
so victoria shot her ?
she couldn &apos;t have .
he drugged her and brought her below deck .
well , then who did this ?
we &apos;re gonna find out . emily &apos;s alive .
she &apos;s at suffolk memorial .
i found her on a boat . she was in shock .
so i didn &apos;t have much time ,
but i made sure that the captain discovered her .
you didn &apos;t bring her in ?
i couldn &apos;t take the risk .
our connection would &apos;ve been revealed ,
and emily would &apos;ve been exposed .
you can &apos;t toy with her life like that .
your plan is over . let it go !
who the hell are you to lecture me ? !
you were the one who drove her to this .
so why don &apos;t we focus on how we can help her ?
because if she survives ,
she is still in danger , maybe now so more than ever .
he &apos;s right .
once the graysons find out she &apos;s alive ,
they &apos;ll--they &apos;ll panic .
they &apos;ll spin some cover story to protect themselves .
or they &apos;ll finish the job .
not on my watch . i &apos;m gonna get some answers .
how you gonna get past the graysons ?
they &apos;ll turn that hospital into a fortress .
then it &apos;s a good thing that i paid for half of it .
you wanna help emily ?
go talk to that girlfriend of yours .
she was there .
find out what happened .
mom ?
i &apos;ve been trying to get to you for over an hour .
what the hell is going on here ?
oh , my god .
i &apos;ve become an official person of interest .
and judging by the look on my attorney &apos;s face ,
i have every reason to be concerned .
is there ...
something you wanna tell me ?
if there is , you know , i can handle it .
no , i didn &apos;t do it , patrick .
but after learning the truth about emily , oh , i wanted to .
what truth ?
she has been targeting my family for years .
she even faked her pregnancy to trap daniel into marriage .
i confronted her . she admitted it .
but you should &apos;ve seen the look on her face ,
as if she were taunting me .
why would she come after you like that ?
i have no idea .
it &apos;s like an obsession .
i shouldn &apos;t have left you last night .
do not punish yourself .
you &apos;re the only person i can truly trust .
and i need you now more than ever .
well , then come here .
sit down , please .
we &apos;re gonna prove that you &apos;re innocent .
i don &apos;t know how .
i &apos;m in terrible trouble .
i was with emily just before she was shot .
and then what happened ?
i don &apos;t know . i , uh ...
i ...
blacked out .
and then i woke up in the stateroom .
i have no idea how i got there .
you gotta tell the police that .
a story that sounds like delusional ravings
of a woman who &apos;s trying to prove she &apos;s innocent ?
no , patrick .
my only hope is that this never surfaces .
daniel , i need you to focus .
sorry .
we were talking about your mother .
can you tell me about her problems with emily ?
what has that got to do with anything ?
well , i think it &apos;s safe to say they don &apos;t ... get along .
my mother didn &apos;t shoot her .
lydia davis claims
victoria was upset with emily right before the attack .
something about a photograph ?
lydia avis is one step above a call girl .
her word means nothing .
well , if i only took the word of respectable people ,
i &apos;d never solve a case .
detective , you have a second ?
vessel ... with the coast guard .
thanks .
they found your wife .
is she , uh ...
yes , she &apos;s alive .
emily &apos;s a very lucky woman .
she suffered massive blood loss
from the gunshots to the abdomen ,
and she sustained a cranial injury
from the impact of the water .
there &apos;s been some bleeding on the parietal lobe ,
which we &apos;ll monitor , but she &apos;ll pull through .
what about the baby ?
i think it would be best if i talk with mr. grayson alone .
come on , charlotte .
mrs. grayson ,
i &apos;m afraid the police have insisted
that you not be allowed access to the patient .
daniel , we &apos;ll be at the house if you need us .
daniel , i &apos;m afraid i have troubling news .
blood tests show your wife was ...
never pregnant .
i &apos;d like to keep this private .
mr. ross , you may as well to turn around right now .
this is a family matter .
emily is my family ,
and i &apos;m gonna make damn sure that yours doesn &apos;t harm her .
how dare you speak to me that way ,
after what you &apos;ve been up to .
what has daniel ever done to you ?
do you get off causing innocent people pain ?
i will let you know if i meet anyone innocent .
so in the meantime , i &apos;m gonna go see emily .
you have no legal right .
without a family representative ,
you may not go beyond those doors ,
no matter how many wings you &apos;ve named after yourself .
well , let &apos;s ...
see what your son has to say about that .
look , nolan , it &apos;s best if you just go .
i thought that we said
that we weren &apos;t gonna let the women in our lives
get in the way of what we have ?
so just help me . please .
you didn &apos;t go to the city last night .
you were with him .
i told you these people couldn &apos;t be trusted .
how could you ? ! oh , how could you ?
mom .
get out of here .
go .
where ...
where am i ?
you &apos;re in the hospital .
why ?
what happened ?
you don &apos;t know ?
what you remember ?
nothing .
i don &apos;t remember ... anything .
please , tell me ...
who am i ?
i should &apos;ve come with you .
yeah , believe me ,
there was no getting past either of them .
i had no choice but to pull the ejector seat .
now we have no way in .
do really think that i didn &apos;t have a backup plan ?
welcome to suffolk memorial &apos;s internal server .
i left a smartphone behind to create a makeshift hot spot .
now i have access to the patient files .
well done . where &apos;s emily &apos;s ?
she &apos;s stabilized ,
but those bullets really did some internal damage .
oh , no .
&quot; transient global amnesia &quot; ?
aiden , that &apos;s major cerebral trauma .
she &apos;s surrounded by the enemy .
she &apos;s faking her condition to buy herself time .
yeah , it does sound like my ems .
she just gave us the opportunity to move her out of there .
to where ?
i know a safe house where she can get medical attention
away from the graysons .
now can you access the other hospital computer systems ?
you give me enough time ,
and i will make the toilets flush in morse code .
margaux .
oh , i &apos;m glad to see you .
i got your messages .
you okay ?
uh , yeah . i &apos;m fine .
i am so sorry about emily .
what happened out there ?
i wish i knew . i saw nothing .
i was in the main room .
and all the graysons claim to have been there , too .
someone &apos;s lying .
are these ...
are these copies of the pictures you gave to the police ?
no , i hid these from them .
they &apos;re the ones taken at the time emily was shot .
after what you told me about conrad ,
i couldn &apos;t risk it .
it &apos;s a good move .
well , if conrad is guilty ,
he &apos;s done an excellent job of hiding it .
look . he &apos;s in photo after photo at the time of the shooting .
this means he had someone else pull the trigger .
or maybe he didn &apos;t do it .
the press think it &apos;s victoria .
she truly hates emily .
and she &apos;s not in any of those photographs .
she &apos;s not the only one missing from these pictures .
you &apos;ve spent more time out in this hall
than in there with her .
well , she needs her rest .
even if she were awake ,
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;d say .
don &apos;t beat yourself up , daniel .
none of this is your fault .
i checked on sara .
she &apos;s okay .
and don &apos;t worry . emily will get better .
she will pull through .
i know the police talked to you about mom .
they asked me , too .
well , she--she &apos;s innocent , charlotte .
i don &apos;t think she is .
no one does .
i never knew how uncomfortable this chair was .
when i showed you that picture , victoria ,
i simply wanted you to know the truth about emily .
i never expected for you to shoot her .
you &apos;re out of your depth , lydia .
you always have been .
cross me again , and watch what happens to you .
ooh . your confidence is woefully misplaced , victoria .
you lack an alibi to substantiate your claims .
and hiding from your lawyer
instead of offering anything plausible reeks of guilt .
i &apos;m really enjoy remodeling grayson manor .
i always thought this room could use a splash of color .
you like that ? huh ?
no ?
get out of my house !
you &apos;re certainly behaving like someone incapable of murder .
but i do look forward
to your performance on the stand , my dear .
i &apos;ve always enjoyed a good farce .
ross , i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m going in .
i just finished looping the security cameras .
you can now move through the hospital undetected .
there &apos;s one more thing i need you to bring with you to the safe house .
engagement ring , perhaps ?
yeah , few steps ahead of you , mathis .
figured you wanna put that little trinket
back on her finger .
i &apos;ll stand by
until you are in position on emily &apos;s floor .
we need to talk .
actually , i don &apos;t think we do .
see , i needed your help today .
but instead , you decided to check back into the bates motel .
and you know what , patrick ?
frankly , i &apos;m not into mama &apos;s boys .
w @-@ well , let &apos;s continue to talk about you , nolan .
you manipulated me , and you did it just to get what you wanted .
you &apos;re no different than emily .
so now you &apos;re going to attack a woman
that is fighting for her life in a hospital bed ?
that &apos;s classy .
oh , please ! let &apos;s stop , all right ?
she &apos;s not as innocent as you make her out to be , nolan !
and quite frankly , neither are you .
you know what , man ?
i should &apos;ve bailed the minute i found out
you bribed my ex @-@ wife to get dirt on me .
well , don &apos;t let me stop you now .
all right , mathis .
let &apos;s do this .
i &apos;m in .
there &apos;s an ambulance waiting for us downstairs .
i &apos;ve arranged for medical attention
to meet us at the safe house .
please don &apos;t hurt me .
who are you ?
emily ?
emily ? em , what are you doing ?
help me !
somebody !
there was a man .
he wanted to take me out of here .
he went out the window .
no . it &apos;s okay .
it was just a nightmare .
no .
you &apos;re all right .
you &apos;re okay .
what &apos;s ... what &apos;s wrong ?
we tried to get emily out .
it , uh ...
it didn &apos;t go well .
she didn &apos;t recognize me .
all i saw in her eyes was fear .
it &apos;s bad .
there &apos;s ... brain swelling .
it &apos;s neurological damage , but ...
i did some research ,
and her diagnosis is as psychological
as it is physiological .
so what are you saying ? that it &apos;s not just from her injuries ?
her mind shut down .
it &apos;s a defense to deal with the trauma .
emily needs someone
to just make an emotional connection with her ,
so she feels safe to be ... well , ems again .
ross , i was--i was with her .
that doesn &apos;t work .
yeah , well , you went in guns hot .
emily wasn &apos;t exactly primed to find her happy place .
getting past the graysons won &apos;t be easy .
but , jack ...
maybe you can go talk to charlotte .
no .
i did this to her .
i pushed emily , and now she &apos;s ...
she &apos;s like this .
seeing me may only make things worse .
this is evidence that margaux found .
i thought you should have a copy .
take care of her .
just let him go .
what is the matter with you two ? !
emily needs us !
look , for all we know , someone is biding their time ,
waiting to finish the job !
you &apos;re right .
what is our next move ?
there &apos;s some things i need to do alone .
mom .
daniel .
oh , i &apos;m so grateful you &apos;re here .
you understand that these accusations against me
are untrue ?
they say you &apos;re gonna be arrested .
well , i &apos;ll endure .
but i promise you , nothing is as it seems .
i know .
i know everything .
you &apos;ve been right about emily from the start .
i did it .
i shot her .
you overheard us on the deck .
i just got a call about sara .
she tried to kill herself .
i couldn &apos;t breathe . i went outside .
that &apos;s when i heard you both .
i didn &apos;t go up there to hurt her .
i was just so angry .
daniel , where did the gun come from ?
i i don &apos;t remember . i was drunk .
the gun was there . i @-@ i picked it up , and--and it ...
now they &apos;re blaming you .
and i know we &apos;ve had our problems ,
but i am not gonna let you go down for my crime .
daniel , you have to understand that emily set you up .
for all we know , she put the gun there .
she is a monster .
i will not allow you to sacrifice yourself
for her cruelty .
no , mom .
daniel , please .
no . no .
my life isn &apos;t your problem to fix .
now i &apos;m getting a lawyer .
and tomorrow , i &apos;m turning myself in , and this will all be over .
no .
victoria .
i &apos;m surprised to see you .
coming here in the middle of this media firestorm
may not be the smartest thing to do ,
but ...
i need an ally .
and i couldn &apos;t help but notice
that you &apos;ve yet to take a public stance on my guilt .
i like to know all the details of a story before i tell it .
jack told you what conrad did to his family ?
yes .
how did you know ?
i didn &apos;t .
but jack is a man of principle ,
and i would think that he would want you to know the truth ,
given your long @-@ standing history with my family .
i was shocked to hear what conrad is capable of .
i think he &apos;s trying to frame me .
you want more than an ally , victoria .
you want an objective party to help prove your innocence .
and expose conrad &apos;s guilt .
you were there , margaux ,
and yet , you don &apos;t seem to buy the police &apos;s theory .
is there something you &apos;re not sharing ?
these are copies of photos taken moments after emily was shot .
each guest claims to have been in the main room .
lydia .
she &apos;s not here .
which means she lied to the police .
you look so beautiful .
it was a like a real @-@ life fairy tale .
you &apos;ve gotta remember something .
i don &apos;t .
i know you will .
you &apos;re my inspiration , emily .
i &apos;ve always relied on your strength to get me through tough times .
i just wish i knew where you got it from .
my father .
you remember him ?
yes .
that &apos;s good , emily .
what &apos;s his name ? tell me .
david .
his name is david clarke .
these were taken in the yacht &apos;s main cabin
moments after the shooting .
lydia &apos;s nowhere to be seen ,
which contradicts her official statement .
oh . if you &apos;re trying to frame her ,
i assure you , your plan is as foolhardy as it is desperate .
oh , i won &apos;t be framing lydia .
you will .
well , now you can add &quot; delusional &quot; to the list .
why would i consent to that ?
to protect daniel .
he shot emily .
that &apos;s absurd .
why would he ?
because she is a sick and venomous liar
who toyed with his emotions .
she broke him , conrad .
and when he finally learned the truth about her ,
he lashed out .
my god .
you &apos;re serious .
as serious as daniel &apos;s desire to protect me .
he will confess unless we act .
and we cannot let him throw his life away
for that vicious woman .
which leaves us one course of action .
lydia goes .
it &apos;s a terrible feeling , betraying someone you love .
i &apos;m so pleased that you finally get
to experience the sensation yourself .
hey . i thought you &apos;d be getting carl by now .
so did i.
but now i &apos;m not so sure .
this thing with emily has really ...
it &apos;s really gotten to me .
yeah . me , too .
i &apos;ve been trying to help her ,
but the weirdest thing just happened .
what ?
emily said she remembered her father .
and when i asked what his name was ,
she said , &quot; david clarke . &quot;
well , she--i mean , she probably ...
saw you and then got mixed up , you know ?
maybe .
she seemed so sure of it .
it freaked me out .
charlotte , um ,
i think it might help if i see emily .
look , she &apos;s obviously confused .
i think i can help her remember that she &apos;s emily thorne
and not ...
someone else .
there you are .
i know everything that &apos;s happened has been a nightmare .
but i feel safe knowing that we &apos;re handling it together .
what &apos;s wrong ?
we &apos;ve been exposed .
i have to revise my statement to the police .
they &apos;ll know i was lying .
yeah , well , lydia , i have no choice .
i mean , i &apos;m facing an obstruction of justice charge .
conrad , we &apos;re talking about my life .
our life .
i haven &apos;t done anything wrong .
i need your help .
well , and i &apos;m gonna be there for you .
oh , come on . what do you have to be concerned about ?
after all , you &apos;re -- you &apos;re innocent , right ?
all you have to do is trust me .
that &apos;s what you said to david clarke .
oh , come on . this is an entirely different situation .
don &apos;t you think ?
i &apos;m gonna look after you .
so don &apos;t do anything rash .
and stay here ,
i know where to find you .
i &apos;ll get that for you .
thank you .
my pleasure .
it &apos;s done .
she &apos;s gone .
that &apos;s an interesting tattoo .
what does it mean ?
i &apos;m not sure .
i saw you earlier .
what &apos;s your name ?
excuse me . could you give us some privacy , please ?
sure .
emily ,
meet jack .
a statewide search is on for lydia davis ,
now the prime suspect in the brutal shooting of emily grayson .
police report the socialite was last seen
leaving an exclusive east hamptons inn earlier today .
so do you have any idea what you &apos;ve cost me ?
daniel , i just allowed myself to believe
that life could be something other than gray and cold .
and i was forced to sacrifice all of it to protect you .
well , i didn &apos;t ask you to .
i was handling it myself .
you were ?
what , by admitting that you shot your wife ?
how very noble for you .
it &apos;s more than you would &apos;ve ever done .
have you lost your damn mind ?
i just offered you freedom at my expense ,
and you made it with reprobation ?
okay . all right , fine .
but if that &apos;s the case ,
the next time you find yourself in need of salvation ,
may i suggest that you drop to your knees and you pray ?
because from here on , your only hope
will be divine intervention from the heavenly father himself
because your earthly father is finished with you !
you don &apos;t think i &apos;ve sacrificed ? !
all i have ever done is sacrifice for everyone !
and i have lost the one person who meant anything to me ,
who never lied to me , who loved me .
sara ? well , there &apos;s no accounting for taste .
you say one more thing about her . i beg of you .
oh , you wanna take this out on me ?
you better think again ,
because i am this close to showing you
what i &apos;m truly capable of .
do it , &apos; cause i &apos;ve got nothing left to lose .
what are you doing here , niko ?
well , when i heard what happened to emily thorne ,
the news didn &apos;t mention anything about you .
so i came to make sure you &apos;re okay .
well , i had to go radio silence . you knew that .
and why are you treating emily ?
that &apos;s too risky for you .
i &apos;m the best doctor you know .
i saved your life when you got shot . didn &apos;t i ?
yes .
and for that , i owe you a debt .
which i plan on collecting .
and i thought that instead of trying to find you ,
it &apos;d be easier to just stay close to emily
and hope you showed up .
well , you shouldn &apos;t have come .
well , i &apos;m here ,
so use me .
fine .
you stay close to emily .
but whatever you do--
don &apos;t trust the graysons .
i know . i remember .
do yoremember what i told you ?
yes .
nothing &apos;s changed .
you &apos;re getting rid of it ?
it &apos;s been tarnished ,
and thus lost its unique appeal .
i &apos;m sorry for letting you down .
i can &apos;t tell you how to live your life , patrick ,
or who to live it with .
do what makes you happy .
i know what you &apos;re doing .
someone hurts you , and you run .
that &apos;s your m.o. , right ?
i &apos;m not gonna let you push me away .
no , i told you before , we &apos;re a team .
so i &apos;m staying right here .
and together , we &apos;re gonna take down everyone who ever wronged you--
conrad , emily , and nolan .
he keeps this , um , box
locked up behind the painting that he took from you .
uh , it &apos;s got this design etched on the side of it .
two infinity symbols . they &apos;re linked together .
i swear i &apos;ve seen it before .
was it something like this ?
it was exactly like that .
there &apos;s something so familiar about you .
well , we &apos;ve known each other for a very long time .
sort of .
there &apos;s kind of a big gap there .
what happened ?
i literally have no idea how to answer that question .
i hate this .
i @-@ i feel so helpless .
if it &apos;s any consolation ,
you are the strongest person i have ever known .
people keep saying things like that .
i don &apos;t feel it .
trust me .
you are the toughest ,
most annoyingly bullheaded person on the planet .
emily , i &apos;ll admit that there have been times i ...
never wanted to see you again .
but ...
then you left me this .
what is it ?
it belonged to my wife .
amanda .
she was wearing it when she died .
and you were there .
i know you don &apos;t remember this , but we had a big fight about it .
we &apos;ve ... had a lot of fights this summer , actually .
that &apos;s my fault . i ...
i &apos;ve been holding on to all that pain and ...
and anger , and putting it on you .
it &apos;s not fair .
i &apos;m so sorry .
that &apos;s what i wanted to say on the beach .
come back to us , emily thorne .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m so sorry .
don &apos;t be .
