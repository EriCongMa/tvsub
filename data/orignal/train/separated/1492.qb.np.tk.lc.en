cake ! cake ! cake !
alex might be a little bit fragile after last night ,
so let &apos;s try to be sensitive .
oh , believe me -- i am going to be
nothing but nice to alex from now on .
if she snaps and goes on a rampage ,
who do you think she &apos;s coming for first ?
she &apos;s not going on a rampage .
i bet she &apos;d let me live . she likes me .
i &apos;m just gonna say it -- i never trusted her .
oh , everybody just be normal .
we &apos;re gonna treat her exactly the way we usually do .
and there she is .
hi , pretty girl .
how &apos;d you sleep ?
fine .
your hair looks super @-@ soft , al .
and is that a great new sweater ? love !
dad , can you hand me the butter knife ?
no !
haley , luke , upstairs , please .
thank you .
thanks .
so , about my meltdown .
who ?
what meltdown ?
i want to see a therapist . i did some research .
dr. gregory clark -- highly recommended ,
specializes in teenagers , and is covered by our insurance .
i booked a double session with him today .
and since you guys have the open house ,
i will be taking the bus .
okay .
that sounds good .
she &apos;s like a self @-@ cleaning oven .
check it out .
i &apos;m rockin &apos; the old school for the open house today .
i &apos;m gonna put the &quot; fizz &quot; back in &quot; phys ed . &quot;
i love it -- all of it .
really ?
yeah .
because i want to make a good impression today .
i want to be the teacher all the parents are talking about .
well , that explains the socks .
what ?
there &apos;s a caste system at school --
academic teachers at the top , gym teachers at the bottom .
it &apos;s offensive and disrespectful .
they treat us like we &apos;re lunch ladies .
hey , there , neighbor .
it &apos;s asher , right ?
yeah .
um , i just wanted to let you know --
i think there might be something
wrong with your air conditioner .
oh , really ?
yeah , i mean , it just seems to be running a lot ,
even when it &apos;s , uh , kind of cool outside .
no , no .
um , my partner runs a little hot .
not as hot as our planet .
sorry . i don &apos;t mean to be that guy .
it &apos;s just , um , we &apos;re all in this together .
yeah , i drive a prius , so ...
and that &apos;s a nice little gesture .
my car runs on reclaimed cooking oil .
i have some literature , if you want it .
that &apos;s okay . save the paper .
i haven &apos;t printed anything since 2004 .
i was gonna e @-@ mail you .
on your power @-@ hungry computer ?
my entire house is solar @-@ powered .
i sell energy back to the grid
and use that money to save polar bears .
i &apos;m an environmental lawyer ,
so , you know , i &apos;m pretty green .
so is your lawn .
i went drought @-@ tolerant --
succulents , indigenous plants , rock garden .
my other daddy says your yard looks like a litter box .
she &apos;s a cute kid .
i remember when she was in disposable diapers .
are you ready ?
yeah .
why do you look like that when i look like this ?
my friends say it &apos;s because of your money .
no , i &apos;m just saying why is she all dressed up
for a school open house ?
i want to impress manny &apos;s history teacher .
i want manny to go to washington , d.c.
yeah , junior congress .
only one kid in the whole grade gets picked to go .
i think i can make a difference .
regular congress can &apos;t even make a difference .
don &apos;t worry , manny . i have it covered .
you just go and enjoy your date .
i have a date . it &apos;s no big deal .
d @-@ don &apos;t make a whole thing about it .
what did i do with my car keys ?
i mean , we &apos;re just friends now ,
but i have a good feeling .
i know -- don &apos;t get ahead of myself .
every time i put them down .
what is her name ?
either zoe or piper .
how can you be going on a date and you don &apos;t know her name ?
this is where it gets interesting .
i seriously doubt that .
a few days ago , we almost let a girl come between us .
who is she ?
the new girl .
she &apos;s pretty .
super @-@ pretty .
dibs .
what ? ! n @-@ no . you can &apos;t call dibs .
she &apos;s a human being with feelings ,
not the front seat .
then a miracle happened .
twins -- each as pretty as the other .
it &apos;s funny -- luke and i don &apos;t usually
go for the same kind of girl .
yeah . i like to describe my type as &quot; gettable . &quot;
what are you doing , tucker ?
oh , hey , principal brown .
do you know how other teachers drone on and on
to parents with their boring lectures ?
well , i thought i would go another way .
oh . well , i don &apos;t like the sound of that at all .
i think you will .
i &apos;m gonna spice things up with a spirited game of dodgeball .
oh , no . no , no , no , no , no .
okay , before you say &quot; no ... &quot;
i already said &quot; no . &quot;
... let me show you my whole bit .
howdy , folks .
my name &apos;s tucker .
i &apos;m the sheriff of dodge ... ball .
&quot; laugh , laugh , laugh . &quot;
and then --
no , no &quot; then . &quot; no .
have you seen the shape some of these folks are in ?
we don &apos;t need a parent dropping dead in here .
look , this is the &quot; dolphin den . &quot;
i am not renaming it
the harvey k. mandelbaum memorial gym .
but i was gonna divide everybody up into
the hatfield and mccoys .
just no dodgeball .
hello , mr. ingram .
i am gloria delgado @-@ pritchett ,
manny &apos;s mother .
yes , of course .
i just wanted to thank you so much .
he thinks the world of you .
you know , as a child of an immigrant ,
he can look at the world with such a fresh perspective .
and talking about fresh ,
i brought you some empanadas .
subtle .
hey , phil . where &apos;s claire ?
oh , she &apos;s going to alex &apos;s classes .
i &apos;m doing luke &apos;s .
i &apos;m surprised to see you here .
isn &apos;t your team playing today ?
yeah . gloria made me come .
i think i &apos;m recording the game ,
but , you know , you can never know .
the last time , i got six hours of bravo .
and who knows ?
maybe manny &apos;s going to be the first latino president .
hello , mr. ingram .
dr. donna duncan ,
wesley &apos;s mom .
just brought you a little thank @-@ you
for being his absolute favorite teacher ever .
those cupcakes are so white .
thank you .
dr. donna duncan .
i &apos;m gloria .
we &apos;ve met several times .
oh , of course .
mario &apos;s mom .
manny .
and how is he fitting in now ? better ?
anyway ...
here she is .
you brought a flask to an open house ?
you want some ? it &apos;s scotch .
no . put it away .
don &apos;t be such a goody @-@ goody .
taste it . it &apos;s older than you are .
i don &apos;t want any scotch .
well , just smell it .
fine .
mr. dunphy , is that a flask ?
no . it is . it i--
uh , i was -- it &apos;s his .
no , it &apos;s not .
for the record , no alcohol is allowed on school premises .
for god &apos;s sake , phil ,
it &apos;s 2 : 00 in the afternoon .
so , alex , tell me why you &apos;re here .
i had a little meltdown last night ,
and i &apos;m afraid it &apos;ll happen again .
but , this time , in the middle of the s.a.t or something .
why do you think you melted down ?
i &apos;m stressed .
it &apos;s my junior year .
part of me feels like
the limbic system in my brain &apos;s a bit off .
that &apos;s a thing , right ? i did some research .
you know i charge the same
even if you diagnose yourself ?
i &apos;m just trying to move this along .
i have a lot to do .
well , uh , this is a process .
you know , it takes some time .
what -- what are you thinking ?
nothing .
no , no . go ahead . tell me .
that maybe you &apos;re not up for this .
i mean , no offense .
you &apos;re just a lot older than you look on your website .
did you even have s.a.t.s when you were in high school
or asian kids ?
oh , no. no , no , no .
but there were other things i worried about --
spanish inquisition ,
sailing off the edge of the world ,
learning how to understand fire .
sorry .
you mind if we try something ?
what ?
just do me a favor .
take a deep breath .
great .
now ... what &apos;s on your mind ?
well ... i just remembered that i forgot
to charge my computer before i left
and that i have to get new index cards before monday .
hopefully they don &apos;t run out of the blue ones ,
because , for some reason , those help me study better .
maybe it &apos;s because they &apos;re easier to read
or maybe my prescription &apos;s getting worse .
i should probably make an appointment with the eye doctor .
also , should i get a job this summer
or would an internship look better on my application ?
and what is up with hillary ?
is she going to run or not ?
i mean , i feel like she &apos;d totally understand
the feeling of being overwhelmed ,
but also like you &apos;re not doing enough at the same time .
hey , nina , how &apos;s sanjay ?
oh , great . thanks .
he &apos;s just dealing with the s.a.t.s and the a.c.t.s.
and that merit scholarship application
everyone &apos;s so stressed about .
what -- what application ?
let &apos;s begin by talking about the a.p. physics test ,
which , as you know , takes place on ...
may 21st .
with luke and haley ,
i &apos;m on top of everything because they aren &apos;t .
but alex is so self @-@ sufficient ,
i just sort of put it in cruise control .
i &apos;ve fallen asleep at the wheel ,
and now my little genius is covered in cake .
now , a list of practice tests i recommend
the students take before then
3a , 4c , 12a through &quot; f , &quot;
18d , 19a , 23c ,
24g , 25h , 26a ...
meanwhile , a great artist like bob dylan
would get voted off in the first round , which --
if you wet the end ,
it will stick to his face .
you &apos;re a genius .
piper , that &apos;s rude .
you know , manny , in chorus ,
we sing &quot; blowin &apos; in the wind . &quot;
now that &apos;s blowin &apos; in the wind .
you &apos;re funny , luke .
manny and i need to use the restroom .
we do ?
you &apos;ve got to switch with me .
what ? no , we can &apos;t do that .
they &apos;re twins . they &apos;ll never notice .
you realize we &apos;re not twins , right ?
special dollhouse delivery for lily !
it &apos;s here , it &apos;s here !
i think you &apos;re going to love it .
i spent so many hours playing with this when i was your age .
yeah , me too .
hey , quick , turn off your car .
why ? it &apos;s in park , i think .
i have a judgey green neighbor .
he had the nerve to come over here
and tell me that i &apos;m not green enough .
shut up ! you &apos;re super @-@ green .
thank you . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m recycling a dollhouse .
i even recycled a child .
didn &apos;t you win some award ?
yes , yes .
the state bar association award for sustained excellence
in the field of environmental ...
yeah , yeah , yeah . that &apos;s the one .
... law . there was one word left .
you didn &apos;t have to cut me off .
dollhouse , please .
okay . yeah , in a minute .
you know what you should do ?
march right over there
and wave that trophy in his stupid eco face .
no . you think ?
yes . those people are so annoying .
there &apos;s this girl at my school
who was all over me about my boots &apos; cause they &apos;re leather .
meanwhile , she &apos;s wearing crocs ,
like those aren &apos;t endangered .
you know what ? i am gonna do that .
show him to out @-@ green me .
okay . oh , no .
oh , no .
all right , those are blowing into his yard .
that is -- okay , that &apos;s definitely gonna hurt my case .
uh , you pick these up .
i &apos;m gonna go get the trophy . lily , help her .
i heard that &quot; recycled child &quot; comment .
thanks to your little flask ,
now the teacher thinks i &apos;m a burnout .
football game .
football game !
what are you doing ?
you can do this now .
i saw it in a commercial .
not with that phone .
you might as well say it into your wallet .
come on . we &apos;re gonna be late for math .
i &apos;m not going to any more boring classes .
you &apos;re just gonna cut ?
no , i &apos;m just not gonna go because i &apos;m in my 60s .
teacher &apos;s lounge .
they got a tv in here .
we can &apos;t go in the teacher &apos;s lounge .
why not ?
um , it &apos;s for teachers only .
you &apos;re a teacher .
right now , you &apos;re teaching me how to be a little bitch .
jay , don &apos;t . jay .
jay !
so , when do you think you &apos;ll be making your decision ?
oh , sometime in the next week or so .
oh , take your time . it would be rude to rush you .
not as rude as interrupting two people
in the middle of a conversation .
well , actually , i &apos;ll go .
i &apos;m gonna go grab some coffee .
good idea because those cupcakes look very dry .
okay . this is unbelievable .
they just gave me four books on applying to top colleges .
when am i gonna have time to read all this ?
oh , my gosh . i &apos;m so sorry .
i didn &apos;t see you there . come on , girls .
oh , she &apos;s so mean .
everybody sees me .
who was that ?
dr. dooda dada .
she thinks that she can flirt her son all the way to washington ,
but i &apos;m gonna take her down .
i would love to chat , but i got to get to a.p. calc .
physical education is a critical part of every school day .
as we develop the mind , so we must the body .
this begins with good nutrition , uh , physical activity ,
sportsmanship , and attention to personal hygiene .
no , please , please , please don &apos;t go .
i know this is boring , but this isn &apos;t my idea .
i wanted to play a spirited game of dodgeball , but --
that sounds fun . i &apos;ll play dodgeball .
i &apos;ll play , too .
anything &apos;s got to be better than this .
oh , well , you know what ?
we &apos;re really not supposed to , but you know what ?
hey , guys , listen to this . my name &apos;s cam .
i &apos;m the sheriff of dodge ... ball .
okay , you guys are the hatfields .
you are the mccoys .
mr. mandelbaum , i &apos;d like you to stay seated .
you &apos;re gonna be our referee .
all right , everybody , let &apos;s dodgeball !
dodgeball was a smash .
dr. donna and gloria were like two assassins
just picking off their victims one by one .
okay , last two dodgeballers .
are you ready ?
yes .
are you ready ?
yes !
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m going to kill you !
gloria , gloria , gloria , don &apos;t !
ow ! my eye ! i don &apos;t understand you !
so , you like theater ,
and you just put this fake thumb in our fries .
yep .
i &apos;m gonna go out on a limb here
and say we &apos;re with the wrong people .
let &apos;s just switch dates and get this party started .
what ? we don &apos;t want to switch .
yeah . i &apos;m not attracted to you .
and i &apos;m not attracted to you .
wait a minute .
we like all the same things , but you don &apos;t think i &apos;m cute ?
i &apos;ve got a thing for latin men .
i like &apos; em dumb .
ugh . well , that &apos;s just offensive .
and shallow .
just because we &apos;re guys doesn &apos;t mean we don &apos;t have feelings .
yeah . i don &apos;t feel good about this .
it makes me feel ...
bad .
come on , luke . let &apos;s get out of here .
our parents aren &apos;t home .
if you want , we &apos;ll make out with you .
i &apos;m not proud of what happened next .
i am .
he &apos;s not home .
how &apos;s the cleanup going ?
well , i think i got most of them .
you &apos;ve been at this a while .
how come you only have like eight peanuts ?
instead of carrying them around ,
i made a huge pile right over th--
again ? !
geez . they &apos;re everywhere .
oh , god . no ! bird !
aah ! oh , no !
oh , no ! no , no , no , no , no !
oh , no ! what is that smell ? !
it smells like french fries !
it &apos;s biodiesel . can you plug it up ?
oh , what ? with what ? popcorn ?
oh , geez . oh , god .
no ! my boots ! this is a disaster !
save the seals !
what -- what -- what -- what the hell ?
what did you do ?
uh , i won a green award .
that &apos;s what .
you think you can get this thing to work ?
hey , you &apos;re supposed to be the lookout .
what if somebody walks in ?
gee , they &apos;ll call my parents .
hey ! look ! you did it !
yeah , it &apos;s not that big of a deal .
listen , i &apos;m gonna get back to class .
before you go , let me ask you a question .
how do you know how to do all this stuff ?
back in high school , i was in the a.v. club .
we did all kinds of crazy things .
one year , we hid a microphone in the gym .
we could totally hear everything that was going on at prom .
i used to make fun of guys like you .
this is pretty cool .
really ?
you think this is cool ...
first down ! all right .
best open house ever .
it &apos;s all gravy when you &apos;re in the a.v.
admit it -- doesn &apos;t it feel good
to break a few rules ,
take a walk on the wild side ?
you &apos;re welcome .
no , you &apos;re welcome .
i &apos;m the one who set this whole thing up .
let &apos;s just say we make a good team .
to us .
there he goes . there he goes .
come on , come on ! come on !
come on ! yeah !
i &apos;ve been like this for as long as i can remember .
can you give me an example ?
well , when i was little ,
i was in a spelling team at school
and i really wanted to win .
i don &apos;t know why . there was no prize .
no one cared .
my parents didn &apos;t even know i was in it .
i just felt this weight on my shoulders ,
like if i lost , i &apos;d ... i don &apos;t know .
i just had to win .
and did you ?
yep . know what the winning word was ?
responsibility .
is that what you feel ?
a responsibility to win all the time ?
to always be the best ?
that &apos;s one way to put it .
and this responsibility -- where does it come from ?
i &apos;m not sure . it &apos;s just ... there .
so it &apos;s an internal pressure .
kind of .
i mean , once you start overachieving ,
people expect things from you .
like what people ?
you know , the world ...
teachers , parents , other kids .
it &apos;s not all internal .
don &apos;t get me wrong .
i like the way i &apos;m wired .
it &apos;s what &apos;s going to get me into a good school .
it &apos;s what makes me who i am .
and how is that -- being who you are ?
i don &apos;t know .
mostly good .
a little exhausting .
sometimes hard .
i guess there &apos;s your answer .
it &apos;s hard being me .
tell me a little more about your family .
they &apos;re pretty normal , i guess .
i &apos;m not like any of them ,
but that doesn &apos;t really bother me .
ever ?
only when they say things like &quot; alex , you study too much &quot;
or &quot; don &apos;t freak out &quot; or &quot; go do something fun . &quot;
so , your siblings--
they don &apos;t experience the same pressures you do .
oh , god , no . they don &apos;t care about school .
hmm . why do you think that is ?
i mean , you all grew up in the same house
with the same parents , yet you &apos;re the only one
who feels this enormous pressure
to achieve at such a high level .
why do we even have to talk about my family ?
they don &apos;t have anything to do with this .
they don &apos;t get me .
how &apos;s that feel ?
i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re a smart girl .
try a little harder .
i said i don &apos;t know .
i feel ...
kind of alone .
i realize our juniors are busy with sats , so as a rule ,
i only give two hours of homework a night .
two hours ?
our students are highly advanced .
it &apos;s nothing they can &apos;t handle .
you know , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m sure they can .
it &apos;s just that if they have two hours in this class
and they have an hour for a.p. bio
and an hour and a half for , um , advanced lit
and-- hang on one second .
let me just do this on the board ,
&apos;cause then it &apos;s-- um , we got 2 and 1 and 1.5
and then another , uh , hour and a half
for a.p. history-- gives us ...
it &apos;s 6 .
yes !
nina , i was getting there .
thank you ! thank you so much !
if i could just have a second to think
without all the tippy @-@ tappy typing .
6 .
well , i hope you &apos;re happy .
you &apos;ve ruined dodgeball for everyone .
she was the one who threw that ball in my face .
only because you threw yourself at mr. ingram .
okay , ladies , please .
can &apos;t you see what &apos;s going on here ?
you both just want what &apos;s best for your kids .
i need to get this trip for wesley .
i &apos;m tired of him being so mad at me all the time .
why is he mad ?
oh , he blames me for the divorce .
his father will always be the hero .
it &apos;s hard to blame someone who &apos;s never there .
now , can &apos;t you relate to that ?
it will get better .
kids always figure out who &apos;s really there for them .
again , we &apos;re very sorry about the projector .
i &apos;ll send a check on monday .
hi , honey .
i got in trouble .
whatever she did , add it to my tab .
all right , let &apos;s do this .
no . no , no , no .
not you two , just you . come on , sheriff .
oh , hey , honey . how did it go ?
good . and i made another session for next week .
how was the open house ?
wow . so intense .
i had no idea the kind of pressure you &apos;re under .
honey , i was just you for two hours .
i could barely hold it together .
i don &apos;t know how you don &apos;t have a meltdown every day .
i ...
oh , honey .
sweetie , what ? did i say something ?
yes .
thank you .
okay .
okay .
okay .
again , i am so sorry .
i @-@ i guess , in retrospect , it was a little crazy
that i wanted to show you my state bar association award .
stop .
and it &apos;s possible i come on a little too strong .
no . no , no .
i like to think that i &apos;m greener than i am ,
but maybe i just want the credit
without doing all the hard work that you do .
well , you &apos;re right-- it is hard ,
but , you know , it &apos;s also alienating .
you know , no one wants to be friends with me .
i @-@ i can &apos;t tell you the last time
i had people over for dinner ,
which is probably a good thing .
you know , with solar power ,
it takes four days to roast a chicken .
really ?
if you want it cooked all the way through , yeah .
you know i had salmonella three times ?
if you want to come over to our house for dinner ,
we kind of owe you .
you can play with my dollhouse .
yeah ?
does it made from sustainable materials ?
