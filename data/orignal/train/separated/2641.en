All units be advised...
Possible sighting, eyewitness report.
Alleged suspect seen entering a silver Chevy minivan,
D.C. plate number Charlie, Romeo, 7...
It'll be fine.
When was the sighting?
12 minutes ago.
Perimeter?
Potomac to Eastern Ave, Western to Southern Ave.
Full lockdown -- airports, trains, busses.
They're not going anywhere.
They?
Unconfirmed reports suggest
the suspect's with someone -- a man.
Is it true what they say?
What?
That she was your partner?
♬She came♬
♬Blood in the streets in the town of Chicago♬
What?
For the record, I believe Agent Keen is innocent.
What did you find?
Suspect's name is Special Agent Elizabeth Keen.
She was my partner, but as of today,
she's a fugitive wanted in connection
with the murder of 14 C.I.A. agents, a U.S. senator,
and the Attorney General of the United States.
They'll set a perimeter.
Yes.
Capitol Police, Park Police, M.P.D.C..
We'll never make it out of the city.
No. That's why we're not gonna even try.
We believe she may have an accomplice.
The most elusive fugitive in the history of the Bureau,
Raymond Reddington.
I want every camera in this city looking for these two.
Every Twitter feed, every Instagram account,
every Reddit thread.
They get out of this city, we're gonna be hunting ghosts.
Let's move...now.
We've identified a silver Chevy van moving north on 395.
You got a visual on the suspects?
No.
The vehicle was picked up by the N.S.A. satellite.
They confirm the plates.
Have they passed through the 3rd street tunnel?
Two minutes out. I dispatched a chopper.
Okay, we got a sighting, 395 north.
I want M.P.D.C. to run a traffic break
and barricade all exits off the 3rd street tunnel.
Seal it up.
You'll need to put that on.
Okay, chopper feed is live.
We have a visual.
Confirm we have a tail team in place
and that all exits are blocked south of 3rd.
You agree with me, right?
About Agent Keen?
Notify H.R.T and get a negotiator on site
in case they take hostages.
♬Blood in the streets♬
This is Eagle 1.
I've got a visual on the suspects entering the tunnel now.
Is the team in place?
Unit 64 entering the tunnel.
Eagle 1 coming around.
We have eyes on the exit.
What do you see?
Nothing yet. Where is my tail car?
Andreen? Andreen, do you have a visual?
Negative.
Something's not right.
Back it up to when they entered the tunnel.
They went in, they haven't come out.
I don't know what to tell you.
There's no silver van in this tunnel.
They can't just disappear.
Well, it is Mr. Reddington.
Pull up the exit footage.
♬Blood in the streets, it's up to my knees♬
There's the exit footage.
♬Blood in the streets in the town of Chicago♬
Hold on, back that up.
♬Blood on the rise, it's following me♬
Stop. There.
Son of a bitch.
Clean it and torch it.
Give my regards to Chichi.
第三季第一集
第38号
Where's Charlene?
I ordered them to take these off.
Where is my wife?
Read Charlene's statement.
Is it true what Tom Connolly did to you?
He made me think I was dying.
Ordered a phony clinical trial that made me believe
he was my only hope
so the Cabal could manipulate me.
If I were you, I'd want him dead.
You think I had something to do with it?
It doesn't matter what I think.
That I helped Agent Keen kill the Attorney General.
I begged her not to do it. I ordered her not to.
Why?
Because Connolly had a plan to bring down everyone.
Not just Elizabeth, but Samar, Aram...
you.
All that matters is that Keen's a fugitive,
and I'm gonna bring her in.
You're not holding Charlene
because she leaked classified information to a reporter.
You're holding her because it gives you leverage with me.
Does it?
I told Agent Keen to run.
You want to know if I'm complicit?
I told her to run.
You're in charge now, Agent Ressler.
And being in charge means you have to decide
what to do with information like that.
Now, let my wife go.
Who's this?
My sister Tiffany.
Tiffany lives in Denver.
I did until last month.
Her husband passed.
She needed to get out.
Red, you know me.
I'm sorry for your loss, Tiffany.
What is this place?
This is where we wait for the Troll Farmer.
The who?
We're getting a little ahead of ourselves.
He won't be ready for at least a week.
Ready for what?
Actually, a week may be nice.
I'll finally get the time to catch up
on some back issues of "Bassmaster."
♬Bye, bye, baby bunting♬
♬Daddy's gone a-hunting♬
♬Bye, bye ba--♬
♬Hunting to get a little rabbit skin♬
♬To put his baby bunting♬
Put her down. Who are you?
What a lovely child.
She is the perfect little angel, aren't we, Elle?
Put her down.
Such fragile creatures, these tiny humans.
Skull's like... eggshells.
Who's her favorite friend?
Should we take along Mr. Panda or Mr. Dinosaur?
What do you want?
I want your father. I'll text instructions.
Mr. Panda, I think.
Update now to our top story, even as authorities allege
Agent Keen committed these acts of terror on behalf of Russia,
various papers are reporting that Russia is not responsible.
Now, according to leaked documents,
one of the alleged leaders of this organization
is the CIA's director...
You released the contents of the Fulcrum to the press.
...just moments ago came forward
to address these reports.
Good afternoon. My name is Peter Kotsiopulos,‬
and I am the CIA's director of national clandestine services.
In the 65 years since this division has been created,
the director's identity
has never been revealed during his tenure.
But today, the President has agreed
to let me speak openly to you so that I may address
the irresponsible accusations
that not only seek to defame me,
but are harmful to our national security.
Did you expect him to just come forward?
...part of a conspiracy are preposterous.
I wasn't sure what to expect.
They are based upon information
provided by Raymond Reddington,
a traitor to our country and a fugitive
who is helping ex-FBI Special Agent
Elizabeth Keen avoid arrest.
The daughter of a notorious KGB spy,
Keen is a wanted terrorist.
My accusers are criminals,
the subject of one of the largest manhunts ever conducted.
Who are you going to believe is telling the truth?
If I didn't know any better, I'd believe him.
But you do know better.
They're gonna believe I'm a Russian spy.
My mother was a Russian spy.
It doesn't matter that I never knew her.
It's the perfect story.
I'm the perfect patsy.
We have to be patient.
Patient?
Do you have any idea the kind of resources
they're throwing at us right now, the manpower?
This city -- - This city is impossible to get out of now.
We have no chance of crossing
the perimeter they've established.
But Washington D.C. cannot sustain a siege.
The economy, the government, one week, two at the most,
and the city will be back to normal.
That's when we travel.
People will go on believing I'm a terrorist.
Check the surveillance feeds
from the hotel where Connolly was shot.
We already have.
Check again.
I want to know exactly what role Cooper played.
DCFD is responding
to a vehicle fire in Columbia Heights.
It looks like the transport vehicle
used by Mr. Reddington's people.
Any signs of Keen or Reddington?
Nope. We'll try and recover
the VIN numbers on the transport
and any vehicles it may have been carrying,
but right now, the fire's too hot,
so it looks like they got away.
Which is, you know, terrible news.
None of us want to be in this position, but we are.
Our job is to catch them.
So, I need you to look me in the eye
and tell me that you can do that.
I can.
Yes.
If you can look me in the eye
and promise me Agent Keen
will get a fair hearing if we do.
I can try.
Come on, that's not good enough.
It's the best I can do.
Let me know as soon as you find out anything on Cooper.
What a jerk.
Sorry.
He's simply gathering the facts.
Yeah, well, there's only one fact about Mr. Cooper that matters --
he's a decent man.
D.C. Field Office just called.
They got a tip on Keen's whereabouts.
Mateus, I didn't expect to see you here.
Peter.
You said Mr. Reddington
did not have the Fulcrum in his possession.
You said it was a bluff.
A ploy.
You were wrong.
And now our plans have been sorely compromised.
Our plans? They're my plans.
They were.
Now they're nothing.
I would advise you to think very carefully
before you use that tone with me ever again.
I pine for the days when conquered generals
had the sense and good taste to fall on their swords.
Now they hold press conferences,
negotiate advances for their memoirs
while the rest of us clean up their messes.
I'm not leaving this to others.
I have every agency within homeland
working around the clock
to find Reddington and Keen.
I don't think you understand, Peter.
I'm here because people in our organization
have lost confidence in you, in your methods.
There's a history here, so I take no joy in telling you
that you're dancing on the edge of a razor blade,
and that every breath that you draw is at our discretion.
This reminds me of Sok Pich.
We were navigating the backwaters in Western Cambodia
hoping to steal some sapphires from a mine foreman.
Got as far as Pailin when the monsoon struck.
Took shelter in a root cellar of all places.
I've never seen so much rain.
Winds like a monarch gone mad.
All we could do was hunker down and wait it out.
But Sok...he just made a run for the village.
So, there I was soaking wet, alone.
Three days of absolute misery.
And then on the fourth day,
I was overcome
by this incredible feeling of... peace.
Something about being hidden there underground
while the rest of the world was being torn apart outside.
This isn't making me feel better.
You have every right to be afraid.
Just don't let it control you.
Poor Sok learned that the hard way.
What happened to him?
He died.
Didn't get six steps before the wind
blew a blade of lemongrass into his skull.
You're in a storm, Lizzy.
You need to find the peace below the winds.
Do you know who that woman is?
Told you it doesn't matter.
She's a terrorist!
Tiff, listen!
If you say a word, if you so much as whisper this to --
What have you done?
Red, I-I can control this.
Your phone.
You've reached the Federal Bureau of Investigation's
major case contact center.
What did you tell them?
You can go screw yourself, pal, okay?
My husband was a soldier.
He died fighting for this country, trying to protect us
from people like her!
Tiff, shut the hell up!
You and I are finished.
What's going on?
We're leaving.
Within seconds, agents are gonna breach this building.
They're gonna want to speak to you
because you called in the tip.
Get rid of them, or your brother dies.
Downstairs.
FBI! FBI!
Hands! Hands!
Show me your hands.
Raymond Reddington and Elizabeth Keen.
You need to tell me where they are right now.
Fugitives? The one -- the one's on TV?
Tiffany Lepman, right?
Yeah. You think they're here?
We got an anonymous tip from your phone
saying they were here.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I haven't called anyone.
Harboring a fugitive is a felony.
You lie to me again, you're going to jail.
Where are they?
I don't know.
Second floor clear!
Look, if I knew something, I'd say.
I'm not gonna lie to the FBI.
Sir, we're all clear.
Aram.
Tip call that came in, call her back.
Double-check the information.
Thank you for your time.
Look, I told you, if I knew anything, I --
Cuff her!
Look at the floor.
Keen, I know you're down there.
Look, there's two ways this ends.
You come up hands raised or we come down guns raised.
Your call.
Hands!
FBI! FBI!
Show me your hands!
On the ground!
Where are they?
No.
Seems a bit indiscrete.
Porsche Carrera.
Two-seater suggests no family.
Price tag indicates he's wealthy enough to live alone,
maybe a girlfriend.
If he's here, it's likely his apartment is empty.
The address will be on the registration
in the glove compartment.
Daddy.
What did he look like?
Black, he was tall.
What did he say he wants?
You.
He says he wants my father.
Papi, he was holding her, and then he --
Isabella, look at me.
Isabella, I will find her.
I will get her back.
You said the plan was to wait,
搜捕仍在继续
that it was impossible to cross the perimeter.
Waiting was an option when we had somewhere to wait.
Now we don't.
We need to contact the Troll Farmer.
But I don't know who that is.
The Troll F--
What do you think?
The Troll Farmer uses social media
to conduct highly coordinated disinformation campaigns
on behalf of governments, lobbyists,
corporations, crime syndicates,
and on occasion, a humble fugitive.
He's mastered the art of information warfare
by creating events, virtual hoaxes
designed to piggyback on real public anxiety.
He activates hundreds of fake accounts
to post thousands of tweets, creating the appearance of,
say, a terrorist attack in Paris
that served as cover for an art heist.
He doctors screenshots from news outlets
to report an Ebola outbreak in Atlanta
in order to drive up the stock of a drug company
developing a cure.
The Troll Farmer is much more than a rumor monger.
The events he creates appear to be real
and provoke a very real response.
Smoke manufactured
to draw the cameras away from the real fire.
She was blonde.
My mother.
That picture in your apartment -- she was blonde.
I look like her, don't I?
We are out of time.
Is she alive?
Hello.
Raymond, Elizabeth, and you are?
Martha.
Martha.
Please -- please don't hurt me.
No, no, no, no.
We're not gonna hurt you, Martha.
We are, however, going to take your cellphone
and lock you in the bathroom, okay?
Okay.
I must say, your hair,
the way it frames your face is very becoming.
Gracias.
De nada.
I reviewed every witness statement
and the surveillance from the hotel.
There's nothing to indicate that Cooper was complicit
in Connolly's death or in Liz's escape.
Thank God.
He wasn't complicit, but you were.
You asked me to see if Cooper helped Liz.
He had two opportunities to do that --
in the hotel where Connolly was shot
and here in the war room where she escaped.
She got out by cutting the power.
We found a traffic camera
that shows her exiting the building at 11:22.
Yeah, from the service corridor
where I found her phone.
Cameras came back online in the war room at 11:23.
That's 60 seconds only you can account for.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I think you let her go.
I think this way that you're acting, this anger,
it's because you think it's your fault.
You trusted her
and she turned around and murdered the Attorney General.
I'm angry because our country was attacked.
We're all angry.
But I know there's something you're not telling me,
and whatever it is, whatever instinct is keeping you
from admitting the truth, I don't trust it.
What are you doing here?
I'm not supposed to see you for another seven days.
There's been a change of plans.
I don't change plans.
Not for you, not for anybody.
This is him? This is the Troll Farmer?
Perhaps I should've told you he doesn't like that name.
I need a week.
You've got an hour.
We're out of time, Chang.
You need to get us out of the city today.
The understanding was
that you were going to stay underground for a week.
That was the contract.
I've had you on retainer for over three years.
Your content providers have all my pertinent files.
You're not the problem, Mr. Reddington.
My programmers are scrambling to build content for your plus one.
She's the wrinkle here.
Today.
Oh, my God. You're...
They said I would be doubling.
They were gonna take pictures,
but I had no idea it was...you.
Who are you?
I guess I'm you.
Elizabeth Keen, right?
Is he here, too?
Reddington? Are you with him now?
I don't mean to pry, but how does it feel?
How does what feel?
To be a fugitive.
3rd street tunnel is still shut down.
News teams, camera crews, choppers overhead.
Anywhere near Capitol Hill,
the Mall, Union Station will be flooded with cameras, too.
Capitol Hill is no fly.
We might be able to use that to our advantage.
What about tunnels under Dupont Circle?
Be a good escape route.
We don't want to contend with Capitol police.
What do we know about the perimeter?
How close can we get?
City is blanketed with traffic cameras and CCTV.
Very few blind spots.
Okay, okay. Talk to me about liabilities.
Twitter, Snapchat, Reddit.
I want addresses, hotspots where a sighting
is most likely to blow up on social.
Give us about a 20% chance of pulling this off.
Chin up, Chang.
Believe in yourself and others will, too.
What is that, another one of your dumbass literary quotes?
Fortune cookie.
You had them and they got away?
Chased them out of hiding.
Reddington had a plan, now he doesn't.
It's a win.
Terror alert has been elevated to severe.
There is no win in that.
Perimeter's 200 blocks.
We're turning over 10 blocks an hour.
Won't be long now.
I've had to brief the White House.
They know you were Keen's partner.
That's an advantage.
I agree.
That's why I've risked my career to back you.
Don't make me regret doing that.
Spoke with Main Justice.
Charlene's being released.
No charges are gonna be filed at this time.
Thank you.
And you're being released, pending further investigation.
Apparently Justice wasn't informed
that I advised Agent Keen to run.
Apparently not.
Glad to know you don't think I was complicit.
I do think you were complicit.
Why didn't you say anything?
'Cause they didn't ask.
Besides, I'm complicit, too.
When Keen, uh...when she broke out of interrogation,
I caught up to her.
I could've stopped her.
I mean, I should've stopped her, but I didn't.
I let her go.
Because I did, the Attorney General is dead.
That's a blessing.
A blessing? Murder?
That's something Reddington would say, not you.
You made a decision based on instinct.
You should trust that.
My job isn't to trust my gut.
My job is to uphold the law.
I intend to do that.
When I was a little girl,
I used to imagine that my mother was a prima ballerina
who danced for Kings and Queens
in London and Paris.
And she only left me with Sam
until she could come home again
and sweep me away.
I never would've imagined.
What happened to her?
My mother.
There was a time in my life when I was quite sure
I knew exactly what happened to Katarina Rostova.
But after all these years, I'm not sure
I have any real sense of how or...
why she disappeared.
Everyone talks as if she was a terrible person.
Was she?
Okay, we're as ready as we're gonna be.
Either you'll be free within the hour
or you'll be arrested and tried for treason.
Think we got something.
Picked it up online. Twitter photo.
Posted it two minutes ago,
taken in the Shaw neighborhood at 9th and Q.
Area's controlled by the 18th Street Gang.
If they're there, it's for protection.
Call vice. I want the location of all known safe houses.
Roll all units. This ends now.
FBI!
FBI!
Against the wall!
I got your girl.
I swear I'll kill her.
I'm not playing with you.
All clear. They're not here.
You hear me, cop? I said I got your girl.
Vans are here.
Vans? We're splitting up?
Yes.
Why?
Because it doubles the odds
that one of us will make it out to clear your name.
I'll fulfill the contract,
but after this, no more, you hear me?
You, this, too much of a liability.
Ready?
Yeah.
You're crazy, old man.
You have no idea.
You didn't have a shot. You could have missed.
Yeah, but I didn't.
You were lucky. I was lucky you were lucky.
I said before I didn't trust your instincts.
Now they scare me.
Okay, I've got something. A call to the tip line.
A CCTV feed and three tweets all indicating
Mr. Reddington and Agent Keen are moving north/northwest
on Foxhall Road past reservoir.
Roll a SWAT team over to Georgetown Foxhall Road.
Hang on, I have a sighting in Adams Morgan.
Wait, wait, no. What?
Aram, talk to me.
Okay, MSNBC's home page
just uploaded video of them at Michigan Park.
Hold on, this can't be right.
What? - All right, my screen -- my screen's blowing up here.
I've got them in Brookmont,
but the tip line has them in Palisades.
What the hell is going on?
I have no idea.
I've got them in five different parts of the city
all at the same time.
Well, that's interesting because CNN
is quoting the head of the Criminal Division saying
they've been captured in Kalorama Heights.
Wait, is that true?
Of course it's not true.
I'm the head of the Criminal Division.
Aram.
Dispatch rolling units to all these sightings.
Uh, yes, rolling all available agencies.
Uh, Mr. Reddington and Agent Keen
can't be in all of these places,
but they must be in one of them.
Or maybe they're not.
That's what Reddington wants us to think.
He wants us to divert all our manpower to the south.
It's a diversion.
Redirect all the units to the checkpoints
along the northern perimeter.
That's where they're gonna be.
Thought I heard on the radio
they caught the two you're looking for.
All units be advised, suspects are in custody.
Repeat, suspects are in custody.
All units please stand down.
We got a problem.
Give me your phone.
Lizzy.
They know.
Where are you?
I made it through, but you won't.
You have to turn back right now.
Turn back where? There's nowhere --
What are you doing?
Getting you out of here.
Where are you going?
Lizzy, listen to me. Take a breath.
You can do this.
What? What am I gonna do?
I'm outside the perimeter,
and I won't be able to get back to you in time,
so you're on your own.
You need to find a place to hide,
someplace where they cannot get to you.
I can't.
Katarina Rostova was the cleverest,
most resourceful woman I have ever known.
What are you saying?
No matter how dark the moment,
she could always find her way through.
She was a Russian spy who I never knew.
No, you didn't.
But that doesn't mean your mother is gone.
I see her in you every day.
She's as much a part of you as the air you breathe.
I can't do this.
You can.
You must.
2650 Wisconsin Avenue.
No. Lizzy, no, no, no.
It's the only chance I've got.
2650 Wisconsin Avenue. Get there now.
Where is she?
Kudos, Donald. I'm impressed.
What do you want?
To give you a blacklister.
I'll pass.
The diversion that allowed me to slip past your perimeter,
the man who orchestrated that cooked it up in under an hour.
He's an illusionist essential to criminals such as myself,
and I am giving him to you.
Where's Keen?
You said you got past the perimeter.
You wouldn't be calling unless she didn't.
No, she didn't.
But I'm not telling you
anything you don't know already, Donald.
I'm sure by now you found the vehicle
that was transporting her.
So, that's what this is about?
You knowing that I'll find her
and giving me a blacklister in exchange for when I do.
No. It's not a trade or a bribe
or an offer of payment in kind
to entice you to look away.
I admire your probity too much for that.
So, what do you want?
'Cause you only give to get.
All I want is your word as a man of honor.
My word.
You know Elizabeth.
You know she's not a Russian spy
or a traitor or a terrorist.
You know that's not who she is.
Doesn't matter what I know.
If you catch her, it will.
It will matter a great deal.
What you know about her,
what you feel about her could make all the difference.
So, my offer.
One blacklister in exchange for your word
that you will give her the benefit of every doubt.
Can you do that, Donald?
Can you give me your word?
Yes.
His name is Bo Chang.
65 East Goethe.
Bo Chang. Got it.
Hey, Reddington.
I will find you.
You know, as my father used to say to me,
just because you've been bumped up
to first chair in the orchestra
doesn't mean you can compose a symphony.
Hello?
Open the door.
Dear, your daughter's life depends on it.
Oh, my God!
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't touch her. Not yet.
Take a picture of her with your phone.
What?
Take a picture of your daughter
and send it to this number, please.
Chop, chop.
Very good, dear.
Thank you for your cooperation.
You returned her. Why?
Because your reputation precedes you, Mr. Zuma.
There was no doubt...
you would do whatever was necessary
to affect your granddaughter's release.
You...
are a man of your word.
Give me one reason why I should not kill you.
Because if you do kill me,
then your granddaughter will not receive
the antidote to the time-released nerve agent
we introduced into her digestive track.
And inside of... three weeks,
will suffer an agonizing death.
What do you want?
I want you...
to breathe...
very deeply.

I'm a Russian agent.
I work for the FSB,
