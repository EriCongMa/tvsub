toby &apos;s fiancee kind of left this .
and i kinda sort of didn &apos;t give it back right away .
i wouldn &apos;t want people to think you stole somebody &apos;s phone .
somebody whose mother is running against your mother .
that would be awkward .
i &apos;m broke . i &apos;m donating my eggs .
this isn &apos;t going to hurt a bit .
you &apos;ve been my rock . thank you .
you &apos;re here to tell me if you &apos;d feel safe
should charlotte dilaurentis leave the hospital .
there &apos;s a line of girls just waiting to take your place .
let them .
what do you wanna do ?
can we just keep driving ?
where did you go that night after you left aria ?
get out !
i &apos;ve got to get in there and get that golf club
before sara tries to frame my dad .
i haven &apos;t broken into a place since my dorm room .
aria , sara &apos;s staying here because this was charlotte &apos;s
old room when she was a patient at radley .
aria ?
i &apos;m not used to having an audience .
well , if you were experiencing performance anxiety
i was completely unaware of it .
i thought places like this only existed in old movies .
how &apos;d you find it ?
well , i searched for &quot; romantic &quot;
and , then &quot; tacky . &quot;
you feeling better ?
much better .
would you like some more budget champagne ?
not now . let &apos;s give these cupids something to remember .
look at this .
now i know where charlotte learned all those
special little skills she had .
all this dust and the doorknob &apos;s clean .
spencer , stay close .
why is this hallway so narrow ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s not a real hallway .
it &apos;s been walled off .
and this whole section of the sanitarium
sealed like something in a poe story .
so what , you @-@ you think they put the wall up ,
when they turned this place into a hotel ?
well , the sanitarium must have done it .
why ?
well , to avoid having to explain things like that
little motivational experiment back there .
buildings can have secrets , too , just like people .
so the hotel doesn &apos;t know this exists ?
i bet it &apos;s not on any of the blueprints .
but sara knew .
yeah .
how do you suppose that happened ?
long , quiet chats with charlotte ?
come on . let &apos;s go back the way we came .
spencer , the file cabinet .
what about it ?
no dust .
are we still in pennsylvania ?
yeah , we &apos;re behind the radley someplace .
well , this explains how sara got in and out
of her room to mess with us .
why go to so much trouble just to sneak out of a hotel room ?
maybe the sneaking &apos;s only part of it .
you &apos;re still really good at this .
i &apos;ve had a lot of practice .
we found a hole in the hotel .
what , you what ?
a hole , in the wall in sara &apos;s closet , in her room at the radley .
that &apos;s how she &apos;s been coming and going all this time without
walking in front of those pesky cameras in the lobby .
hold on , hold on . okay ?
i &apos;ve been working with the data from yvonne &apos;s cell phone .
you found something ?
it was buried deep in the server .
i looked , but i didn &apos;t touch .
what is it ?
it &apos;s the opposition research file on your mom .
these are my mom &apos;s medical records .
how did they have these ?
look at the corners , the folds .
this isn &apos;t a scan , somebody photographed this with a phone .
this is not research . this is an invasion of privacy .
uh , this is exactly what &apos;s wrong with american politics .
this is completely illegal , and--
spencer .
spencer .
did you know your mom was sick ?
yeah .
she was .
she was a long time ago .
you better look .
肿瘤科
breast @-@ conserving surgery .
blood panels clear .
prognosis , cautiously optimistic .
this report is dated eight months ago .
my guess is that the phillips campaign is gonna leak this .
they &apos;re gonna make it seem like
your mom &apos;s been keeping it secret ,
and that she &apos;s not healthy enough to serve .
she never told me anything about this .
i don &apos;t understand why the state police are getting involved .
there &apos;s a history here , dr. rollins .
several jurisdictions were involved .
they said that , charlotte &apos;s death ..
... she struggled .
her wounds indicate that she fought back .
what exactly were those wounds ?
anything you have to say to me
you can say in front of dr. rollins .
before her body was thrown from the bell tower
she was struck along the cervical spine
with some kind of metal rod .
rectangular at the end and hollow .
how do you know the shape ?
it made an impression .
a cut in the skin of her neck .
alison , have you ever heard of a restaurant
called the two crows ?
i don &apos;t think so .
what about it ?
the night charlotte came home , the night she was murdered
someone used the landline from
the two crows to call this house .
nobody called here .
the call went through .
it lasted more than three minutes .
there weren &apos;t any calls .
were you here all night ?
no .
then it could have come after you left .
there &apos;s only one landline and that rings down here .
if you didn &apos;t answer it and dr. rollins was gone
then it must have been charlotte who picked up the phone
and talked to someone for three minutes .
a hole in the closet ?
yeah , it led to all of this space underneath .
whole parts of radley that had been sealed off .
parts from when charlotte was there .
should we tell hanna &apos;s mom ?
no .
if we tell mrs. marin , she &apos;ll throw sara out
lock , stock and ladder .
this way we know about her escape hatch
but she doesn &apos;t know that we know .
maybe i really did see her in the clinic .
have you checked in with them
to make sure everything &apos;s okay ?
yeah . i ... i &apos;m gonna go over there as soon as they open .
guys , we need to tell ali .
tell alison what ?
she was with me at the clinic .
and she needs to know about that .
she needs to know about sara .
okay , if we do tell alison
we have to be ready for her to turn right around
and go talk to the police about it .
maybe that should happen .
maybe this is a new problem
and we &apos;re getting stuck in old thinking .
secrets are getting toxic again .
i don &apos;t know , just keep on trying to get in touch with hanna .
i have to go meet my mom at headquarters .
okay .
do you want me to come with you ?
honestly , no . i wanna do this myself .
are you absolutely sure ?
yeah . i &apos;ll be alright .
or i will be as soon as i know .
okay .
hi .
liam .
hey .
hi .
oh , my god .
wait . what are you doing here ?
that was it for the welcome ?
no , no , no . is something wrong ?
no , no . all is good .
i wouldn &apos;t come all this way with bad news .
hey .
em .
this is liam .
yeah . i know , we met .
sort of . on the computer .
nice to meet you in person .
um , i &apos;ll give you a call as soon as i know .
okay .
so , what &apos;s up ?
you and i need to talk about ezra fitz .
and the book .
morning , spencer .
hey . uh ..
i was hoping i could talk to my mom for a second .
sure , i &apos;ll look the other way if you can get her
after she finishes the phone call .
okay .
oh , and , uh , tell melissa
i can &apos;t reimburse her without a flight number .
if she can &apos;t find the boarding pass
tell her to look for the luggage tag .
sure .
thanks .
yeah .
you &apos;re welcome . bye @-@ bye .
you were just gone this morning .
i know .
yeah , i looked at my phone and added up the events ,
and realized i was heading towards a 27 @-@ hour day .
you were talking to gill ?
yeah .
tell him not to worry .
worry about what ?
about the poll numbers coming out today .
he thinks they &apos;re gonna be soft .
well , are you worried ?
uh , it &apos;s not on my schedule , so i guess i &apos;m not .
i know this is the hard part
but after the election comes the fun , right ?
right .
alright .
family bonding time is over
we have our radio interview in two minutes .
okay .
best of luck !
thanks , honey .
later .
later .
bye .
so , explain this to me .
yes , these are the main talking points .
i did a little pre @-@ screening .
okay , he &apos;s not gonna ask that .
no , no , no !
抱歉 由于出现故障 今日预约取消
emily .
hey .
you &apos;re closed ?
we had an accident last night , a malfunction .
what kind of a malfunction ?
our one of the freezer units failed .
we lost everything in the unit .
i &apos;m sorry , but it was the unit with your donated eggs .
it wasn &apos;t just me , was it ?
we &apos;re cross @-@ checking
but there are something like 30 clients involved .
thirty people ?
there are backups
and the backups have backups but everything failed .
the power was cut , the alarms ..
everything .
i have to get back .
we &apos;re still making calls .
jordan ?
jordan ?
hey , did you order breakfast ?
someone left this tray outside .
where were you ?
went down stairs to make some calls
and use the wifi without waking you .
sorry , i should &apos;ve left a note .
well , don &apos;t do that , don &apos;t leave
without telling me where you &apos;re going .
hanna , are you okay ?
yes , i &apos;m fine , we just ... we have to go .
where would we be going ? &apos;
back to rosewood .
okay , i @-@ i &apos;ll call the driver we &apos;ll get out of here .
have some breakfast .
i didn &apos;t order any .
oh , it &apos;s must be on the house then .
&apos;when did it start again ? &apos;
after charlotte &apos;s funeral .
after sara came back .
look , ali , whoever this person is ..
... they think we know who killed your sister .
do you have any idea who could have done it ?
i know that charlotte hurt a lot of people but ..
... for someone to kill her ..
no , ali , whoever &apos;s threatening us now , wh ..
whoever &apos;s stealing emily &apos;s eggs
and sending us pictures of golf clubs
that person didn &apos;t kill charlotte .
they want revenge for what happened to her .
what golf club ?
the murder weapon was a golf club .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
what detective tanner described was a hollow piece of metal
cut with a rectangle at the end .
are we getting punked ?
the picture , the golf club .
maybe this is some kinda of joke ?
i don &apos;t think it could be a joke .
i mean , sara doesn &apos;t have any sense of humor left .
guys ... have either of you
heard of a restaurant called the two crows ?
but you are in touch with them ?
yeah , it &apos;s a one way communication .
the point is our boss is excited
and it would be a good thing for us to keep her that way .
has he sent you more pages ?
yeah .
can i see them ?
i thought if i came here i could read them
without you having to put them on the internet .
yeah . yeah .
i &apos;ll show you the pages .
great .
julian had some notes about tom .
i wanted to head off any problems .
what kind of notes ?
i was just actually looking forward to it .
i &apos;m sorry , em .
i know you weren &apos;t gonna keep them anyway
but i &apos;m still sorry .
i keep thinking about all those other women and couples .
you know , someone would do that just to steal my eggs .
well , first off , i think that you should stay here .
you have enough to deal with with having to ..
... keep up the shields with your mother .
yeah , i think , that &apos;s an excellent idea .
when i was driving back into town , i ..
... past that &quot; welcome to rosewood &quot; sign
and i kept thinking ..
... why did we come back and why can &apos;t we stay away from here ?
what does this creep want from us ?
they want us to lead them to the charlotte &apos;s killer .
why us ?
because we wanted charlotte dead .
i mean , think about it .
all the people who could &apos;ve killed charlotte
they might have done it because they thought
that &apos;s what we wanted .
what kind of nut would think that ?
the kind who would hold my eggs for ransom .
and destroy a freezer full of potential babies
just to get them .
hello , spencer .
what happens if i just ask you something straight out ?
try it and see .
did you tell yvonne to leave her phone at lunch ?
yes .
to prove to her that she shouldn &apos;t trust me .
that &apos;s what i told her .
yeah , but then you never told her that i took it .
no .
because that &apos;s not really why you set it up .
you wanted me to have it , you wanted me to find something .
that sounds very elaborate .
yes , but this way it wouldn &apos;t look
like you &apos;re passing me campaign information ?
you could have plausible deniability
if i ever actually found something .
i &apos;m sorry ..
... about your mother , spencer .
i &apos;m praying that she &apos;ll be alright .
why did you go through all this trouble ?
because it &apos;s wrong ..
... what they wanna do .
the campaign &apos;s gonna leak the report .
it &apos;ll look like your mother is unworthy of the public trust .
does yvonne know ?
i &apos;m sure she doesn &apos;t .
i doubt her mother knows .
plausible deniability .
right .
oh , my god , spence , are you ..
you didn &apos;t know your mother was sick ?
i &apos;m so sorry , i @-@ i thought that you must--
thank you , mona .
what the clinic tell about the accident ?
mechanical failure .
she believes that ?
what do you mean does she believe it ?
well , the way we rushed back here , i wondered if ..
... maybe she thought it was more than that .
because she &apos;s a woman pumped with hormones ?
because of the things she &apos;s been through
with you and your friends in the past .
okay , so she &apos;s not hormonal
she &apos;s paranoid , is that what you mean ?
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m not doing very well in this conversation .
you started it .
because i &apos;m worried about you .
look , i &apos;ve had a rough couple of days , okay ?
hanna , i &apos;ve never seen you wound so tight .
i buried someone who made my life hell for years .
i &apos;m now being questioned in her murder .
i lost my job--
bad things happen all the time .
conspiracies are harder to come by .
someone tried to hurt you .
and they went to amazingly complex lengths to do that .
that person is dead .
if you keep looking for things in the shadows i guarantee you
you &apos;re gonna start seeing them .
come back to new york with me .
i can &apos;t .
emily needs me .
yeah ?
what does hanna need ?
what do you think ?
what &apos;s that doctorow quote ?
good writing doesn &apos;t tell you it &apos;s raining ,
it lets you feel what it &apos;s like to be rained upon .
you like it ?
yeah , it &apos;s beautiful .
you said that julian had notes .
well , nothing that can &apos;t be addressed .
sometimes there &apos;s a shift in language .
conflicting voices .
you &apos;re former teacher &apos;s a terrific writer .
gives me a rush reading his stuff in manuscript .
same sort of rush i get when i read your writing .
well , he was my teacher .
you wrote this .
not all of it , but big parts of it .
i @-@ i might have cleaned up the syntax .
you put in the man with the straw hat .
the one we saw at logan .
god , you were with me .
mm @-@ hmm .
i got a funny feeling after i read the second chapter .
i thought i &apos;d better take a look .
this is even more you .
is ezra fitz here in rosewood ?
maybe a little incapacitated ?
no . he &apos;s not here .
does he know what you &apos;re doing ?
and what , exactly , do you think you &apos;re doing ?
do you believe her ?
i think it &apos;s the truth .
it might be the truth , but do you believe mona ?
do you believe why she did this ?
i don &apos;t think anybody knows why mona does anything ,
including mona .
but there &apos;s the file , that &apos;s the reality .
what did your mom say ?
i don &apos;t know , i couldn &apos;t ... i couldn &apos;t even talk to her .
look , you are already in the phillips &apos; computer .
can &apos;t you just corrupt the file ? can you erase the report ?
they can &apos;t say anything because they shouldn &apos;t
have it in the first place .
spencer , right now , i &apos;m a fly on the wall .
the minute that i do anything , like , delete a file ,
red lights go off everywhere .
i am breaking the law just by being in there .
you know what she has to do , right ?
your mom has to go public with this .
she has to get in front of the story before
the other side leaks it .
it &apos;s her secret , not mine .
well , one way or another ,
it &apos;s not gonna be a secret much longer .
汉娜
i never intended to actually start writing it .
i just wanted to keep julian interested .
well , you did that .
is ezra gonna be in big trouble over this ?
how come you &apos;re not asking if you &apos;re gonna be in trouble ?
well , i just took that for granted .
there &apos;s a fine line between trouble and high adventure .
i think you should finish the chapter .
if he &apos;s not back by then , we &apos;ll figure something out .
he &apos;ll be back .
i think you &apos;re right , he &apos;ll probably be back .
but when he does , you &apos;ll have to explain
all this creative writing you &apos;ve been doing and why .
how do you think he &apos;s gonna feel about that ?
i poked the bear and the bear stole emily &apos;s eggs .
we poked the bear together .
so , it is our fault .
what happened to emily ?
no . bullies don &apos;t need an excuse .
they &apos;re just bullies .
i bet that a was planning this as soon as they found
out what emily was up to .
you said &quot; a. &quot;
i mean , what do you want me to call it , waldo ?
it &apos;s not &quot; a. &quot; i mean , it &apos;s not the same person .
it &apos;s just a letter , a symbol .
you know , it &apos;s like an algebra problem .
solve this equation for a.
yeah . i can &apos;t tell you how much algebra comes up
in my everyday life .
it &apos;s not the same person , but they want the same thing .
they wanna make you miserable .
but this time , you are smarter
and you &apos;re stronger .
and you know that you can beat this
because you &apos;ve done it before .
when did you go all micro @-@ brew ?
couple of years ago . mostly because of toby .
we kept threatening to open a brewery .
well , maybe you will .
maybe .
things have changed though .
personal dynamics are different .
yeah , i guess so .
if you have to go ..
yeah , actually
there are some things i need to take care of , so ..
oh , no , no , no . it &apos;s good .
next time .
next time .
who &apos;s your friend ?
uh , this is harvey .
he really likes your hors d &apos;oeuvres .
well , he better , they cost enough .
i don &apos;t think sybil likes me very much .
who &apos;s sybil ?
your new boss .
her name is celeste .
i called her sybil .
probably why she doesn &apos;t like me .
she looks like a sybil , though .
all the designers that you work for look like sybils .
i can &apos;t keep track .
i thought that you wanted to come here .
i &apos;ve been buried in work for three weeks .
i wanted to be with you .
then come back inside .
so ..
do you wanna go to the hamptons next weekend ?
the hamptons are just another part of manhattan
except it takes three hours to get there .
what do you want ?
what do you want ?
i want to be in a place where we don &apos;t have to
ask each other what we want .
i wanna go back to just ... sort of knowing
what the other person wanted .
yeah .
where was that place exactly ?
ladies and gentlemen , the mind behind the collection .
it &apos;s fine . go ahead .
i got stuff i need to finish , anyway .
are you sure ?
yeah . sure .
will i see you at the apartment ?
where else would i go ?
don &apos;t turn into a sybil .
you can drink coffee this late and it won &apos;t keep you awake ?
it &apos;s tea .
can i talk to you for a minute ?
i wanna thank you and the others
for staying in town , helping with the investigation .
we didn &apos;t have much choice .
i know you &apos;ve all got your own lives , things to do
and staying in rosewood has got to be a sacrifice .
it certainly is for me .
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re strangers here .
no , it &apos;s not .
so , what do you think of the old town ?
has it changed much ?
in some ways , yes . in other ways , not so much .
i &apos;ll tell you one way it &apos;s different .
what happened to charlotte dilaurentis
that is the first homicide we have had here in five years .
all that time you and your friends weren &apos;t here ,
no murders .
but when everybody gets together ..
... i just think that &apos;s a very interesting statistic ,
don &apos;t you ?
i don &apos;t know about statistics .
i just know that alison deserves some answers .
i &apos;m glad you feel that way .
so , if i have to take steps to keep all interested parties
here in rosewood till this is resolved ,
i know you &apos;ll understand .
don &apos;t let your tea get cold .
going down ?
i have a message for you and all of those little monas
running around inside your head .
if i find out that you &apos;re messing with spencer in any way ,
shape or form , i will personally take you apart .
just out of curiosity ...
who kisses better , hanna , spencer or me ?
watch your step .
and ... i turned around and it was just charlotte and me .
my dad didn &apos;t want anything to do with us .
jason was at the carissimi group .
we were alone ..
... until elliott started taking care of charlotte .
dr. rollins saved charlotte &apos;s soul ..
... and you fell in love with him .
at first , i thought it was gratitude ..
... but it wasn &apos;t .
and then i realized it was mutual .
and it was also inappropriate
because he was your sister &apos;s doctor .
in one way charlotte and i are alike .
we put a lot of energy
into being people no one could love .
like we were trying to prove something .
and then someone looks at you ..
.. and sees you , and it &apos;s alright .
i don &apos;t wanna keep it a secret anymore .
i &apos;m tired of secrets .
ali ..
... there &apos;s no time .
it &apos;s late , i &apos;m sorry .
no , no !
i mean there &apos;s never enough time .
hi . yes , gil .
uh , i &apos;m here . give me the numbers .
okay .
yeah , that could &apos;ve been better .
uh @-@ huh ? what does it look like county @-@ by @-@ county ?
okay .
when am i doing drive time scranton ?
who is driving in scranton at 5 a.m. ?
no , just , uh , give me a call ten minutes before .
thanks . bye .
the numbers haven &apos;t moved in a week .
i swear it &apos;s gonna come down to the 15 remaining
undecided voters .
well , i will hunt them down for you
one at a time .
will you take them to the polling place ?
i will carry them on my back if necessary .
mom .
i &apos;m worried about you .
don &apos;t be . we &apos;re gonna win this thing .
i know . i &apos;m not worried about the election .
i &apos;m worried about you .
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
i hope so .
you know what i wish ?
what do you wish ?
i wish i would have done this 20 years ago .
ten even .
all that time i wasted suing people ..
getting property easements ..
well , you &apos;re doing it now .
yes , i am doing it right now .
and you &apos;re gonna win .
yes , i am .
and now you need to go to sleep .
well , pretty soon .
i love you .
i love you too .
oh , honey , uh , gil wants the
the flight number off of melissa &apos;s bag .
it &apos;s in the barn .
okay , goodnight .
i should have you that i was gonna talk to spencer .
i was just afraid that you would try and stop me .
how did it feel , telling her about us ?
it helped .
helped ?
it helped me make up my mind about us .
things are moving very quickly .
i think there &apos;s an argument to be made
for keeping it the way it is .
for now .
i guess we could do that .
but then we &apos;re gonna be having this conversation in ..
a month ..
or a year .
and i don &apos;t think i can take that .
i know it &apos;s been difficult , but ..
i wanna protect you .
you don &apos;t have to protect me from rumors .
they can &apos;t hurt me .
not anymore .
but if you &apos;re afraid for yourself ...
well , that &apos;s ..
that &apos;s something else .
what do you want , alison ?
i want something very complicated .
i want you to take me to a movie .
i want you to hold my hand in a restaurant .
we should &apos;ve waited for spencer .
no , we have to get there before sara has a chance
to take emily &apos;s eggs out of the mini @-@ bar .
i don &apos;t think she shoved them in there
with those $ 7 orange juice .
god , my mom thought she got rid of all the radley ghosts .
wait till she finds out about this .
she &apos;ll be down here with a jackhammer .
what was that ?
do you think that &apos;s sara ?
maybe she needs a hand .
i want to see for myself .
and i thought maybe there was an old freezer or something down there .
there &apos;s nothing . no electricity , no nothing .
why didn &apos;t you tell us ? we could &apos;ve gone with you .
i wanted to go alone , in case i found them .
the desk clerk said nobody &apos;s seen sara harvey
since she left the hotel last night .
where is she ?
i don &apos;t know , probably in some other hole somewhere .
i &apos;m sorry about grabbing your boob , em .
don &apos;t worry about it . i just have to face it .
one way or another , my eggs are gone .
look , emily , you have the money .
use it . finish school .
that &apos;s what you wanted .
that &apos;s why you put yourself through this .
yeah , hanan &apos;s right .
what happened was terrible
but you &apos;re not responsible .
bullies don &apos;t need excuses .
you can always donate them again .
just remember to keep some for yourself .
yeah , i just wanna be with someone when that happens .
and so far my relationships have all been challenging .
well , you will have kids ,
you will have kids , spencer will have kids ,
i will have kids , and we will all have beautiful babies .
more visualizations ?
absolutely .
just wait till you see what i &apos;ve planned for our playdates .
you know i was thinking ...
... maybe the other side won &apos;t use it .
maybe they &apos;ll have an attack of conscience
and , uh , take the high road .
well , there &apos;s never any traffic up there .
how &apos;s your mom ?
she &apos;s tired .
but she &apos;s happy .
she &apos;s really happy .
and how about you ?
you need anything ?
i need you to go get a glass
&apos;cause your girlfriend &apos;s drinking all by herself
and it &apos;s real sad .
that i can do .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , i ... should be honored
that you thought i would kill someone for you .
ezra , i was afraid . alright ?
i @-@ i felt all of this just starting over again .
it was terrible .
look , the night charlotte was killed
after i left you , i ..
... i wanted to tell you where i went
but i was asked not to .
by who ?
by your dad .
and your mom .
i saw them in town ..
... and they ... didn &apos;t want you to know
that they were getting close to getting back together
so they asked me not to tell you .
