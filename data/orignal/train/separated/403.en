W.S. Gilbert wrote "it's love that makes the world go 'round."
And if it's true then the world spun a little faster with Haley in it.
Haley was my best friend since we were in high school.
We certainly had our struggles
But if there's one thing we agreed on unconditionally
It was our love and commitment to our son Jack.
Haley's love for Jack was joyous and fierce.
That fierceness is why she isn't here today.
A mother's love is an unrivaled force of nature.
And we can all learn much from the way Haley lived her life.
Haley's death causes each of us to stop
And take stock of our lives.
To measure who we are
And what we've become.
I don't have all those answers for myself
But I know who Haley was.
She was the woman who died
Protecting the child we brought into this world together.
And I will make sure that Jack grows up
Knowing who his mother was and how she loved and protected him
And how much I loved her.
If Haley were with us today
She would ask us not to mourn her death
But to celebrate her life.
She would tell us...
She would tell us to love our families unconditionally...
And to hold them close
Because in the end they are all that matter.
I met Haley at the tryouts
Of our high school's production of "The Pirates of Penzance."
I found our copy of the play
And was looking through it the other night
And I came upon a passage that seemed...
Appropriate for this moment.
"oh dry the glistening tear
"that dews that martial cheek.
"thy loving children hear
"in them thy comfort seek.
"with sympathetic care
"their arms around thee creep
"for oh they cannot bear
To see their father weep."
Ok you can go ahead.
Blow mommy a kiss.
If there's anything I can do...
Thank you.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Thank you Gina.
Thank you for coming.
I think you could use some air.
Jack's ok.
I saw him with his cousins.
Ok.
Jessica would you make sure that Jack gets something to eat?
Sure.
And I'll be right back. Thanks.
What do we do?
There's nothing we can do.
We just gotta wait him out.
You think he'll ever come back?
Would you?
He'll come back.
I just don't know what he's gonna look like when he does.
We just need to be there for him when he's ready.
You know I broke my promise to Haley.
What promise?
I told her that I would catch Foyet
And that I'd... spend the rest of my life making it up to her.
You still can.
You saved Jack.
You know I may have the tools to do this job
But I don't know if I have the tools to help my son.
You have to ask yourself
What kind of father you want to be.
And when you figure that out...
Then you'll know what to do.
I meant what I said today.
Things have changed.
And I need to do what's best for Jack.
You will.
They can't be calling us in not tonight.
I'm on it.
We can't go.
We have to.
I'll get Rossi.
Talk to Strauss tell her to send another team.
There's no other team available.
Nashville's calling us in.
Second body in 2 weeks both killed on consecutive Friday nights.
They realize they're up against the clock
And they're hoping we might find something they didn't.
Guys.
I'm sorry but we just got called in.
We have to go.
Call me if you need anything.
Take care of your son.
Thanks.
You gonna be ok?
I'll see you when you get back.
"where we love is home--
"home that our feet may leave
But not our hearts."
Oliver Wendell Holmes.
Two women dead in two weeks
Both killed in their own homes
And no sign of forced entry.
Floors were covered in rose petals.
Quite the romantic.
Evidence of sexual assault?
None.
Both women were last seen leaving their offices on a Friday
And never showed up to work on a Monday.
It's Thursday. Why are we only being called in now?
The second body was only found yesterday.
There may be a socio-economic pattern emerging.
The first victim Bethany Heminger
Lived in Belle Meade Melissa Johnson in Brentwood.
Both are affluent neighborhoods.
Yet there was nothing missing from either home.
What did these women do for a living?
Bethany was a defense attorney Melissa a corporate executive.
Two brunettes with similar features
In high-powered professions? That's not a coincidence.
These women most likely represent someone he knows.
All right so we need to figure out where this unsub is
meeting his victims and how he's gaining access to their homes.
And if he's staying on pattern
Most likely this guy has picked out his next target.
We should check gardeners
Housekeeping staff pool attendants floral shops
See if anyone worked both homes.
Start working up a paper trail Garcia.
Find out where these women were in the days leading up to each murder.
Like a genie in a bottle--poof!
All right. Prentiss you and I
Are gonna go check out the Johnson crime scene.
Rossi you and Reid talk to the coroner
Start working up victimology.
JJ talk to the families and staff
And find a connection we can use.
I understand that all of our thoughts are with Hotch.
But right now I need us all to focus on this case.
We have less than a day before this unsub will strike again.
Let's finish this thing fast.
You must be the FBI.
Landon Kaminski.
Agent Jareau. We spoke on the phone.
Yeah it's nice to meet you.
The mayor's on my ass.
Two prominent women killed on my watch
And everyone knows we're bracing for a third.
Well let's hope that doesn't happen.
Where would you like us to set up?
In here.
I'm gonna need to issue a statement with the press.
Every woman in Nashville needs to know
There's a serial killer on the loose.
We need them taking preventative measures
To avoid becoming his next target.
The mayor thinks we should be as specific as possible.
Every woman detective.
His first 2 victims may be from the same social class
But if we isolate victimology this soon
It may cause him to go outside of his own comfort zone
And then he'll be even harder to track.
Better to stress hypervigilance
And shut down his victim pool completely
Don't you think?
Yes ma'am.
Well the house has a security system
But her friends say that she only used it when she traveled out of town.
He killed the dog
Hid it in a storage container in the garage.
She probably thought he was protection enough.
That was her first mistake.
She had all the precautions to avoid home invasion
She just didn't use them properly.
These are the prints that match the other crime scene.
It looks like he didn't hesitate to get them everywhere.
Which typically would indicate that he's disorganized.
This crime scene screams of organization.
The roses
The dog.
He was a stranger to these women.
He didn't talk his way in he was laying in wait.
And he knew his prints wouldn't show up in the system.
He had no priors which means he was smart
And most likely educated.
This guy knew exactly what he was doing
And he made sure he had enough time to do it.
So he knew when she'd leave the house
And when she'd return.
He's stalking them.
It's only the victim's prints on the exterior doorknobs.
Nothing on the windows the garage wasn't forced.
So how did he get in?
Defensive wounds on both women.
More so on the latest victim.
She fought back the hardest.
No ligature marks. They weren't bound.
So how does he keep them from running out?
Maybe he blocked the escape route
Or maybe the threat of a knife was enough.
I might be able to answer that.
The stab wounds weren't the only injuries.
What do you mean?
Melissa Johnson had a concussion.
Bethany Heminger a broken rib.
An initial assault to prove his dominance
Make sure they're too scared to try and escape.
Something else you should see.
Both their stomach contents were the same.
Chicken broccoli pasta salad
and red wine.
He's playing out a fantasy.
One he has to control.
He sets the scene with flower petals and wine
And then he cooks for them.
Their last supper.
So he cooked and he cleaned up after himself.
Why did he leave the petal trail?
It's gotta mean something our guy.
He's not just reliving a fantasy
He's repeating it.
It's the same routine the same meal.
It's not just routine
It's proper etiquette.
What?
Take a look at this.
There's a handprint
In the center back of this chair right here.
He pulled this chair out for himself.
Over here there are handprints on either side of the chair.
He pulled this chair out for her
Poured her wine...
And even cleaned up after the meal was done.
But up he something changed.
Then he drew her a bath.
And this is where Melissa johnson was murdered.
This is where the fantasy ended.
Because she broke it?
I would.
What do you mean?
Well after the initial assault downstairs
Fine I'm scared
But I'm still looking for another chance to escape.
Dinner wine dishes.
I'm not in any immediate danger
So I can take my time wait for the right moment.
I do what he says because I don't want him to hurt me again.
But once he gets me in here
I am at my most vulnerable.
So fear takes over and she fights back.
Because if she doesn't...
Home is where you're supposed to feel safe.
Nobody deserves to have that taken away.
That's it!
All right right in there!
Hey buddy it time for pjs.
Can I watch one more time?
I'm waiting for mommy.
All right ready to make a wish.
Ok. 1...
3. Blow 'em out!
Nice job!
Ok. Happy birthday.
Say hi daddy.
Hi daddy.
Let's give him a big kiss.
I miss her too.
Can I sleep in your room again?
Sure
Ok come on.
Find anything?
Several people had access to each home.
Housekeeper gardener pool cleaner dog walker
each with their own key and an alibi match.
Any cross-over?
None.
We even vetted delivery people
an utility workers.
Garcia do you have anything?
There's no hits on the prints at all
but I did what sir Derek there asked
and I created a paper trail.
There's no cross-over between the two victims themselves
in the wee leading up to their murders
But they did run in similar circles.
How do you mean?
They both have country club memberships
though to different clubs.
They went to upscale restaurants
private concert venues posh hotels.
They enjoyed a high-class highfalutin lifestyle
an expensive one.
A lifestyle he'd fit right into.
This guy is educated intelligent proper.
He's a downright gentleman.
The rose petals sent a pretty specific message.
He's romancing them whether they want it or not.
He's got the social skills to back it up.
Hey Garcia take a look at dating services
and social networking sites.
Look for working professionals
and privileged elite.
Check check and checkers.
Back in a smidgen.
We need more.
Have we figured out how he's getting into these homes?
No sign of forced entry anywhere.
Yet he's still gaining access to their homes
long before the victims ever get home from work.
I mean this guy needs time to cook
and set up his scene.
He's either got a key or he can move through walls.
We need fresh eyes.
All right listen up.
I want everybody to go back to the hotel
and try to get some rest. We're gonna have
to pick this up again in the morning.
We're giving up?
No. We're gonna take a break.
We have to give the profile at morning roll
and none of us has slept since the funeral.
Once Garcia can get us a paper trail
then we can expand our canvass.
Till then there's really not a lot we can do.
Would you please turn the music off?
But it's your favorite song.
How do you know that?
It's the most played song on your ipod.
No! No! stop!
Stop it.
You're ruining it.
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.
Ease. I'll do whatever you want.
I've put a lot of time and effort
into making this a special night.
Is it too much to ask for a little appreciation?
I'm sorry.
I won't do it again.
Please.
I'll do whatever you want.
That's ok.
I forgive you.
A little misunderstanding right?
Yes. That's right.
I'll just forget all about this.
Yes please.
Now...
I think it's time for your bath.
ok Jack listen
I want you to figure out
where you want to put all your toys ok?
Ok daddy.
Alright sweet boy.
Chief Strauss I appreciate your coming to me.
Oh of course. This isn't a time
for you to be away from your son.
Come in.
Jack can you say hello to Chief Strauss?
Hi Jack.
Hi.
Have a seat.
So how are you holding up?
I'm ok.
And how's Jack?
He's coping.
I don't think he fully understands
everything that's going on.
Oh right well how could he?
You said that there was something
You wanted to discuss with me?
Yes I do.
This's retirement.
I've talked with the director.
Given the circumstances
There's no reason you should have to return to the bureau.
We can offer you full pension and benefits.
Are saying that you want me to leave the BAU?
Well obviously that's your choice
but I'm offering you a way out.
Agent Morgan's promotion
was temporary
but he's exceeded our expectations
and I'm confident that I could make it permanent
if you decide to step down.
The team would be together
and you could be with your son.
And when would you like a decision?
I thought I would be leave with one.
What's your hesitation?
I would just like to weigh all of my options.
Whatever you need.
We believe our unsub is already with his next victim.
If he matches pattern she'll be a successful woman
Probably brunette early 30s to mid-40s.
She'll be at home in Nashville's upper echelon.
This means that he fits in. He drives the right car
He wears the right clothes he's highly intelligent.
He probably comes from a place of status.
This guy's sociable and he's endearing.
You would never suspect that
this man is capable of murder.
But he will do whatever it takes
To protect the fantasy that he's trying to relive.
It's this fantasy which fuels his drive.
He's recreating a romantic evening
And repeating it with each of his victims.
He most likely recently had a relationship
taken away from him.
So look at men who have lost loved ones
or have gone through a messy divorce.
But like bundy
These women are representations of that first loss.
Bundy picked victims who had similar features
To the woman that abandoned him
And we believe that our unsub is doing the exact same thing.
These women were confident successful and strong
And they fought back.
Which means he has the ability
To overpower them fairly easily.
He believes or fantasizes
He's in a relationship with these woman.
No matter how fleeting the initial interaction is
It's everything to him.
An invitation.
Our technical analyst has compiled a list of locations
That the victims visited prior to their death.
These are high-class establishments.
We're going to want to visit the same places.
So look for men who fit the profile
But also women who match victimology.
If somebody's been paying a little too
much attention to them talk to them.
Get a read then jot their name down
So that we can check them out.
All right folks pick up your
canvassing assignments and get to work.
Thank you.
The rain's supposed to clear up today.
It's gonna be in the high 50s.
What do you want to do today?
There are a lot of good movies playing at the green hills mall.
You want to go see something?
Why don't we stay inside today?
Maybe watch a dvd.
I want to go on a real date joe.
I thought...
After we made love last night
You'd realize how much you mean to me.
Don't you trust me joe?
Who's that?
I have no idea.
Erika?
Honey it's me!
You home?
Got a surprise for me baby?
Erika?
Grant help!
Why do you have a key?
Run!
Get upstairs! go go go go go!
Grant! grant!
Why--do--you--have--a--key?!
No! grant! aah!
No! grant! no!
Hey erika sweetie...
Why did he have a key?
Why did he have a key?
House belongs to an erika silverman
Project director in an international design firm.
We're assuming the male victim
Is her boyfriend grant franklin.
Male victim?
Mm-hmm. They're both pretty beat up.
We'll need dental records for a positive I.D.
Who called it in?
Ups guy. Needed her to sign for a package
The door was wide open. We got him out back.
Jj talk to him.
Where's erika silverman's body?
He changed his m.O.
Multiple stab wounds to the face and neck.
Classic overkill.
And evidence that she had sex before she died.
Forced or consensual?
No evidence of sexual assault.
She played along.
She had sex with the the unsub
Because she thought it would keep her alive.
So why didn't it?
This kill is personal angry.
She didn't give him everything that he wanted.
What else does he want?
The dinner dishes are washed but the breakfast plates aren't.
He didn't clean up this time.
The boyfriend must have surprised him and disrupted his routine.
I don't know I'd say he came pretty close to finishing it.
It looks like they watched a movie had an early breakfast.
She was with him all night.
Hey garcia.
Bad news buttercup.
Great. What is it?
No payoff on the social networking sites
And this erika silverman person
Does not leave a breadcrumb-like trail.
Aside from a couple of online purchases
And some automatic debits she hasn't
used her credit card all week.
All right. Thanks.
Hey. So garcia couldn't find anything about erika silverman's
Whereabouts over the past week.
No stores no restaurants nothing.
There may actually be another way
To figure out where she's been.
Do we know where any of the victims' cars are?
As far as I know they're in impound.
We need access to all 4 of them.
4?
We should also get grant franklin's car.
He may have driven erika somewhere where she met the unsub.
There has to be something in the victimology.
If grant franklin hadn't come home when he did
Erika would probably still be alive.
So how did the unsub miss him?
It says he was out of town last week
Visiting family in indianapolis.
Still the violence of those kills
Indicates he knew both victims.
'cause the longer victims are with the killer
The more desperate the attack.
The unsub stabbed erika silverman 17 times in the face
Grant franklin 34 times to the face and genitals.
It makes sense. The more he perfects his routine
The more invested he becomes.
Detective kaminski have your men had any luck
Canvassing the victims' last known whereabouts?
None. I'm thinking of pulling them off for the night.
That's a mistake.
Why is that? The vic's dead.
If he sticks to the pattern
We've got another week before he strikes again.
Because he's never gotten this far before.
He's desperate to play out his fantasy.
A man like this isn't gonna stick to any timetable.
He's gonna try to finish this tonight.
Jj we need you on the news.
Narrow victimology. Let people know
that he's out there right now.
I'm on it.
We still don't know where he's finding his victims.
But we do know that erika silverman
Lived in green hills.
That's 3 points and we finally have
Our geographical comfort zone.
It's a good bet the unsub lives somewhere in this area
In this area
And Erika is our key to figuring out
Where they met.
Oh man pancakes for dinner.
Is there anything better?
No no there are not.
Hey Jack who are these guys?
This is you and this is the bad guy.
They're fighting.
Who wins Jack?
Daddy. No one beats daddy.
Hey Jack.
Aunt Jessica's almost got dinner ready.
I forgot what do we do before we eat?
Wash our hands.
Good job.
Come on.
He built those himself. I hope it's ok.
Of course.
Listen I really appreciate your coming over.
All your help and support it's been great.
He's my nephew and you're my family.
I'll be here as much as you want.
The bureau has offered me retirement.
What did you tell them?
You know Jack needs me now more than ever.
That means being here full-time.
After Haley and I were apart he didn't have very much
And that was hard
But I knew that at least he had his mom
And right now he really needs his dad.
Of course he does Aaron.
We both know you and Haley didn't separate
Beuse you stopped loving each other.
Your job just got in the way.
Your team needed you
And despite this offer I doubt that's changed.
Maybe you don't need to retire.
What if I stayed with Jack
When you had to be away?
Jessica I appreciate that...
Please...
It would mean a lot to me
If you'd let me help you out with Jack.
For Haley.
Garcia's got something.
I'm a girl genius 'cause this is what I did
I took the travel logs from the GPS systems
Overlaid their routes againts the geographical profile
To reveal what the paper trail could not.
Which was?
Well Erika Silverman is the only victim
Who didn't visit a private club
A concert or go to a fancy restaurant
In the days leading upon her death
She did spend a couple of hours
At cheekwood botanical gardens on Tuesday.
Garcia did either of the other victims go to the park?
No.
I don't know if it's relevant then.
It is when her navigation system
Reads in a straight line.
To work back home to work back home.
I don't think she ever left her house.
She even had her groceries delivered.
What was she doing on Tuesday?
Let's find out.
Where is everybody?
Well JJ and Reid are checking on a lead
And Prentiss is reconvencing with detective Kaminski.
Good. Then we can talk.
Rossi
It's his team.
I'm not gonna stand on the way of that.
It might not come to that.
What do you mean?
Strauss offered him retirement.
He'll never accept it.
Don't be so sure.
This job cost him his wife.
It cost him that a long time ago.
Which is why he won't let it cost him his son.
What do you think he'll do?
It doesn't matter what I think.
What matters is
Whether you'll be willing to step down
If he comes back.
Or step up if he doesn't.
I'm gonna do whatever Hotch needs me to do.
He's lost enough.
Hey Rossi.
You mind coming here for a second I want to throw something at you.
We profiled that
Our unsub recently experienced a loss as well.
A loved one.
Probably a brunette who ran in the same circles as his victims.
Right.
What if love wasn't the only loss?
I mean we assumed that because our unsub
Could so easily navigate our victims' upscale world
That he most likely shared the same
Financial resources as his victims.
Because of his upbringing his sophisticated behavior.
But that behavior is ingrained in him.
It's habit.
It something he would have learned as a child
Not as an adult.
If he didn't have financial independence
But were still trying to keep up his social status
He'd be hemorrhaging funds.
We've been looking at this the wrong way Rossi.
We vetted the maids the gardeners the pool cleaners
Anyone who had access to the houses
But who else might go unnoticed
In a privileged society?
Garcia here.
Garcia check employee records
At each of the venues the victims visited
In the week prior to their death.
Look for men spending beyond their means.
A guy who's racked up a lot of debt Garcia.
Look at cars wardrobes
Something that does not fit their current income level.
A scholarship-funded private school education maybe.
As you can see
The park attracts a variety of patrons.
Older couples walkers tour groups.
We'll hold an occasional wedding
Or concert series on our upper lawn.
Did you have any events here past Tuesday?
Tuesday. Oh we had a corporate fund-raiser
Between 4:00 and 7:00.
That's when Erika Sliverman was here.
An event up here would be a hard sell
For women in heels
Well most of our private events hire valets
To drive the cars down to the base of the park
So they don't have to hike it up the hill.
Who has access to your keys
But goes unseen?
And your GPS.
Dealerships program your home address into the navigation system
Before your car even leaves the lot.
He had turn by turn directions straight to her front door
And the keys to get him inside.
Thank you...
Joe.
Please state your desired destination.
Take me home.
Culpepper valet company handled the
Fund-raiser on Tuesday and...
The same company had contracts
With the hotel lounge thany heminger frequented
And the country club Melissa Johnson was a member at.
That's our connection. JJ get Rossi
And prentiss to pick up the owner.
Right away.
All right baby girl talk to me.
I need employee records and a list of venues
That culpepper contracted out to this weekend.
Oh sug check your email.
It hit your inbox 60 seconds ago.
Thanks Penelope.
All right Culpepper contracted out to 3 venues
This weekend 2 today.
We might be able to catch this guy in action.
Unless he's already with another victim.
The man we're looking for
Would have been assigned to cheekwood park on tuesday.
Hold on let me uh pull the roster.
Ok we had 6 guys at that site on that day.
He would have had very few if any disciplinary citings.
He's proper.
He appears to have had a gentlemanly upbringing.
He's a romantic. He would have talked about women
And love frequently.
He might have just ended a long-term relationship
Or lost someone close to him.
Belser. Joe Belser.
Him and his girl they broke up.
When was that?
A few weeks ago. They were engaged.
Do you know what happened?
He was head over heels in love with her.
And she was sleeping with the best man.
The manager said Belser picked up a shift
At the vonner street lounge.
Yeah we're headed there right now.
Ok. SWAT's gonna meet us at belser's apartment.
Garcia did you find anything else on belser?
Ok. He attended southern charleston preparatory academy
On scholarship his parents died in a boating accident
6 years ago.
Belser lost his inheritance in the stock market
And since then he has been racking up debt
Faster than he can pay it off.
He was engaged to society magazine editor Rose Smith
Until 6 weeks ago...
When it was called off.
And the chapel was already paid for.
So he spent his entire savings trying
To live in the world of his fiancee.
She was his lifeline the society he'd grown up in.
Only to have her leave him and wind up penniless.
Hey Garcia I don't suppose Belser's car
Has a lo-jack system on it does it
No. No such luck boy wonder.
Need potential victims' names.
Ok. We'll get back to you.
FBI! Open up!
Joe Belser FBI!
If you're in there identify yourself!
It's clear here.
Clear.
Hey uh I think I found the meaning of the rose petals.
Look at these.
Garage door openers?
Universal garage door openers.
This solves the problem of having to copy the key.
Some drivers are smart enough to use a valet key
But no one thinks to take a garage door opener with them.
That's how he got into Melissa Johnson's house.
We only found prints on the interior garage door.
We thought it was from he moved the dog into the garage.
People rarely think to lock a door
That lies beyond another locked door.
Reid. He's not here.
A beautiful brunette
Late 30s early 40s.
She would have been driving a high-class suv or sedan.
She only buys high-end.
No?
Thank you.
Vip?
Definitely.
Let me check the register logs.
This is a list of all of our customers
Who made charges in our vip section tonight.
They have their own attendant.
15 names. Only 6 were women.
Garcia we need you.
Whatcha got?
All right 6 names used credit cards
At the Vonner street lounge in the past 3 hours.
Jennifer Ketelson Kiegan Murphy
Heather Aldridge Meg Natraj
Ann herron and katie gotshall.
Ok I'm cross-referencing the geographical profile
With financial records.
Oh these 3 look good
And one a brunette.
Her name is Ann Herron.
She lives at 431 Pyle street.
We got him.
Sweetheart.
Stop! No!
No no!
We are going to be happy together.
No!
Don't you want this to work out?
Answer me!
No!
Annie!
I'm trying to make this a magical night!
No!
No!
You ruined this!
FBI! Put it down!
It's ok. You're gonna be ok.
Fantasy's over.
Is that what you did to them?
You hit them to shut them up and then forced them
To play along with your sick delusion?
I love them.
You're finally gonna meet your soul mate Joe.
In prison.
Only you're not gonna be able to push him around
The way you did those women.
And when he comes for you
In the middle of the night
When you're least expecting it
You do me a favor.
Play along.
How is she?
She's strong. She'll make it.
But you don't survive something like that without scars.
Scars remind us where we've been.
They don't have to dictate where we're going.
I had a feeling I'd find you here.
Have you told her yet?
Told her what?
That you're coming back to the team.
That fighting the bad guys is who you are.
I don't have to tell her.
She already knows.
"what lies behind us and what lies before us
Are tiny matters compared what lies within us."
