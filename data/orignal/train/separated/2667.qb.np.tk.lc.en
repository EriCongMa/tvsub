there was a time when italian people didn &apos;t have a lot of options .
you mean like mario cuomo ?
sorry .
i put food on the table .
my father was in it , my uncle was in it .

the chapter on buddhism is spectacular .

could i impose on you to tell him ...
... i need to reschedule monday &apos;s appointment ? i &apos;m down with the flu .
does he have your number ?
let me give it to you .
i lost my pencil , up his ass .
i &apos;ll tell him you called .
why does he have to lie ?
why couldn &apos;t he tell me his therapist is a woman ?
maybe he did tell you , and you didn &apos;t hear him .
why wouldn &apos;t he tell me , unless he &apos;s screwing her ?
carmela , please .
i thought he was changing .
i thought therapy would help clear up the fucking freak show in his head .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re wrong about them .
therapy is a start . it &apos;s a good start .
but , yes , it doesn &apos;t fix the soul .
he &apos;ll need help from other sources to repair that .
then you talk to him ! you help him !
but , well , there you go .
i mean , will he listen ?
he must be a very unhappy man .
he &apos;s unhappy ? ! sleep is my number one ... ah , shit !
why go into it ?
mommy !
yes , bear ?
would you put me to bed ? i &apos;m scared .
sure , honey , hold on .
i thought she was sleeping .

really ?
different picture .
oh , totally .
you talking to me , pilate ?
you must be talking to me . i don &apos;t see nobody else here ...
... except barabbas , here . &quot;
you know what &apos;s remarkable ?
if you take everything jesus ever said , add it up ...
... it amounts to two hours of talk .
no !
i heard the same thing about the beatles .
except if you add up all their songs , it comes to 10 hours .
yes .
it wasn &apos;t just what christ said , it was his deeds .
see , that &apos;s my question .
i understand what he did , but a lot of what he said , i don &apos;t get .
like , &quot; the sun rises on the just and the unjust alike ? &quot; why ?
because , christ was saying that we &apos;re all ...
whores will go to heaven before the righteous ?
that &apos;s not right .
father , we got some major contradictions here .
it &apos;s about love . see it that way .
what does that mean ?
it means ...
... hopefully someday we will learn to tolerate ...
... accept and forgive those that are different .
change through love .
i better get going .
where you going ? you just got here .
it &apos;s getting late .
well , it &apos;s pouring rain out .
i know you love the dvd player . i got remains of the day .
see , do i know you ?
anything with emma thompson .
i didn &apos;t know you looked .

to take in through the eyes a beautiful woman ...
... is that different than a sunset ? a douglas fir ?
or any of god &apos;s handiwork ?
hey , fred .
tanky , what do you say ?
you gonna give away homemade cheese this year ?
for what they get for cream , i don &apos;t know .
tank , anybody been looking for me or asking any questions about me ?
big guy , new york sounding ?
is there a problem ?
no . dipshit hit me with his boat while i was tubing on caribou lake .
claims it was my fault .
if he shows up , do you want me to call ?
yeah , i wouldn &apos;t mind . do that , thanks .
no one &apos;s asking for you , fred .
all right , vitus . thanks .
hello , rat .
please leave me alone .
why won &apos;t you show me your book ?
this is my private time . you &apos;re invading it .
oh , is that so ?
i &apos;m invading your private time , am i ?
yes .
what &apos;s in that book ? come on , let me see .
or are you protecting me , is that what you &apos;re doing ?
would i be shocked ?
would it ruin my character ?
let me see it .
father , turn it off . i can &apos;t handle it .
what ? what is it ?
oh , father , i &apos;m a terrible person .
oh , no . you &apos;re a wonderful woman .
it &apos;s been building in me . i need to get it out .
there &apos;s so much in me , i ...
i want to ...
carmela , if i can help , please .
how ?
how long since you last confessed ?
i , uh ....
if you &apos;d like , i can do this .
you mean here ? now ?
the whole world is god &apos;s house . he hears and sees everything .
forgive me , father , for i have sinned .
it has been four weeks since my last confession ... what am i talking about ?
that &apos;s a lie .
i haven &apos;t truly confessed in 20 years .
go on .
i have forsaken ...
... what is right for what is easy .
allowing what i know is evil in my house .
allowing my children ... oh , my god , my sweet children , to be a part of it .
because i wanted things for them .
wanted a better life . good schools .
i wanted this house .
i wanted money in my hands , money to buy anything i ever wanted .
i &apos;m so ashamed .
my husband ....
i think he has committed horrible acts .
i think he has ... you know all about him , father phil .
i &apos;ve said nothing . i &apos;ve done nothing about it .
i got a bad feeling .
it &apos;s a matter of time before god compensates me ...
... with outrage for my sins .
all right , come on .
oh , tequila breath .
sorry , dad .
it &apos;s all right . just hang on to me .
throw up on that dress , i &apos;ll have to tell mom .
this guy was giving me tequila shooters .
oh , god , everything is spinning .
you &apos;re not mad , are you ?
a little bit .
where are the keys ?
i gave them to you .
supposed to be .
i love you , dad .
i know .
you must truly repent .
genuinely and honestly .
in the future you must renounce these actions , and god will absolve you .
i don &apos;t know , father . i &apos;ll try .
but i still love him .
i believe he can be a good man .
then you help change him into a better man .
then you will have done good in god &apos;s eyes .
you should take communion .
why do you have that ?
unfortunately i had to say mass for someone in intensive care .
lord , i am not worthy to receive thee .
but just say the word ....
and i will be healed .
this is the body of christ . it was broken for you .
this is the blood of christ .
it was shed for you .
accept the spirit of christ , our lord and savior .
amen .
in the name of the father , the son and the holy spirit . amen .
dad ?
i booked a seat on a boston flight . tomorrow , 4 : 00 .
best i could get .
don &apos;t come .
i &apos;ll make sure you &apos;re gone before it happens .
we won &apos;t ever meet .
this is my thing .
i am your soldier . this is my duty like we &apos;re always talking about .
the way this went down ...
... this is my call . i &apos;ll vouch for this myself .
clipping a rat puts me a cunt @-@ hair away from being made .
he might &apos;ve recognized me at the gas station . he could lam .
you stay put . end of discussion .
why are you using the pay phone ?
these walls are like paper .
please don &apos;t lie to me .
go back to bed .
lying down made me throw up .
hello .
oh , hi , honey .
oh , yeah . was it fun ?
oh , good .

i &apos;m home !
carmela .
i don &apos;t know where to begin .

you took an oath and you broke it .
i could have killed you outside the motel .
your daughter was drunk .
i was in the parking lot .
i didn &apos;t do it because of her . i told myself :
it &apos;s just a coincidence ...
... he &apos;s taking her to college .
with wiseguys ...
... the hustle never ends .
if you &apos;d shot me , your life would have been over .
please . i &apos;m begging you .
jimmy says hello from hell !

the motel didn &apos;t have the watch . i went to the restaurant .
i had to wait for them to open .
the restaurant had your watch ?
i took it off in the bathroom while i washed my hands .
you ready ? you &apos;ll be late for bowdoin .
