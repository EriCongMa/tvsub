i just spoke with him , he &apos;s supposed to meet with me here .
oh , yeah , bill , one of his cases ...
well , a kid in one of his foster homes od &apos;d ,
so he had to rush to the hospital .
oh my god .
yeah , it &apos;s terrible .
i take it he told you about callie ?
yes .
yes , well , it seems that she &apos;s been having
a few issues with male authority figures , of late .
which is ...
that &apos;s why he thought of us .
right .
so , she got into a fight with her foster father ?
and damaged some of his property ,
which is how she landed here in juvie .
damaged his property .
uh ... wow . david ...
bill and i have known each other for a very long time ,
and he &apos;s been a friend of the
family ever since he placed the twins with us ,
but i cannot bring someone violent into my house .
i &apos;ve got my own kids to think about .
no , this was just a one time thing .
listen , it &apos;ll only just be for a few weeks .
oh my goodness .
when the kids get out , some
of the other inmates get jealous and pick fights .
one second . one second ?
but ...
callie ? callie , hi .
i &apos;m david , i work with bill at child protective services .
um ... where &apos;s jude ? do you know where he is ?
i don &apos;t know ...
i need to speak to him .
where &apos;s bill ? why isn &apos;t bill here ?
we &apos;ll have to talk about that later .
i just , i don &apos;t understand why i can &apos;t talk to jude .
that &apos;s enough . i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
callie , this is lena .
lena , callie .
i guess i could take her to one of the group homes .
it &apos;s just for a few weeks , right ?
ok .
so , mariana and jesus were in the foster program , too .
they came to us about eight years ago ,
and we formally adopted them five years ago .
foster system sucks .
jesus ...
he &apos;s right . it kind of does .
ok .

callie &apos;s kind of had a rough day .
so , how about we cool it with the third degree ?

yeah , it &apos;s right through there . you &apos;ll see it .
so ... where &apos;d she come from ?
i , i talked to bill
from child protective services , you remember him ?
to talk to him about something and he ...
you know , he was in a bind with callie .
and he needed some place for her to stay .
she &apos;s had a rough time lately , so ,
i really need you guys to be extra nice to her .
please ?
what were you talking to bill about ?
guess .
all right , so i was going to wait till everyone was home
to talk to you guys about this . have a seat .
i was calling to find out
when we could set up a meeting with your birth mom .
i thought you would be more excited .
this is kind of all you &apos;ve been
talking about for the last six months .
yeah . yeah , i know .
i did , just ... i don &apos;t think so .
did jesus talk you out of this ?
just because he doesn &apos;t want to go ... - don &apos;t look at me .
no , i just ... changed my mind is all .
ok , so did you guys do your homework ?
what ? why you gotta look at me like that ?
just &apos; cause you get straight a &apos;s and you don &apos;t have to study ?
jesus , everyone has their strengths .
hey . hey , guys .

if you call your mom ,
she &apos;s going to look in
the system and find all of these complaints
that my foster father made against me .
you &apos;re going to get me sent back to juvie ,
and jude is going to be stuck in that house .
i gotta go .

wearing one of his ex @-@ wife &apos;s dresses .
started beating the crap out of him .
seriously ? he hit him ?
yeah . i mean , he used to hit me all the time ,
but , you know , whatever .
but , when i saw him going after jude ...
i just ... well , i tried to stop him ,
but he kicked me in the stomach .
so , i went outside , grabbed a baseball bat ,
beat the hell out of his precious trans am .
the cops came . he told them that i went crazy ,
and he was defending himself .
nobody seemed to care much about my side of the story .
hey sweetheart .
you ok ?
i just ... i don &apos;t feel so good . my stomach hurts .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m going to be able to go to brandon &apos;s thing tonight .

no , i just ... i think i just ate something bad .
i really need to lie down .
ok . well , yeah , go lie down and we &apos;ll see how you feel later .
hey , so , what &apos;s going on with mariana ?
what do you mean ?
um , why is she pretending to be sick ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe she &apos;s actually sick ?
or it could be that time of the ...
if you say &quot; time of the month , &quot;
i &apos;m going to sign you up
for a women &apos;s health workshop at my ob @-@ gyn .
don &apos;t ever say that in a house full of women .

i just ... something &apos;s up with the twins .
meaning ?
well , mariana &apos;s pretending to be sick .
uh @-@ huh , stomach ache ?
and jesus is all clammed up .
he &apos;s not saying something .
do you think it &apos;s about ana ? do you think ...
maybe i &apos;m putting too much pressure on mariana ?
absolutely not . i think she has just changed her mind .
they &apos;re not ready yet . really , it &apos;s ok .
you keep me sane .
i don &apos;t know how ...
... sane you &apos;re going to feel
after you hear what happened at work today .
now that vasquez is leaving , you &apos;re never going to guess
who roberts is partnering me up with .
who ?
mike .
apparently , he asked for me .
oh please , do not go all non @-@ verbal on me .
it is not a big deal , honey .
it &apos;s really not . it &apos;s ...
now who &apos;s all clammed up .
come on , honey . it &apos;s mike .
it &apos;s just mike .
it &apos;s just mike .
hey mike .
you guys ready ?
brandon , your dad &apos;s here !
it &apos;s time for your competition !
he &apos;ll be down in a second . i think he &apos;s nervous .
brandon ?
so , i hear you and stef are going to be back on the beat together .
stef says you asked for her .
i did . look , it was either me or a rookie .
i was never comfortable when she was working with vasquez , i ...
look , i just feel better knowing i &apos;m around . ok ?
and we got the kids to think about .
thanks .
i mean , as a feminist ,
i &apos;m totally offended and everything , but ...
... as her wife , you know , thanks .
yeah , just don &apos;t tell stef i said that .
god , where &apos;s that kid ?
brandon , shake a leg ! we &apos;re going to do this thing !
hey mike , you clean up nicely .
stef .
hey , why aren &apos;t you changed ?
hey , he &apos;s not here .
what ?
yeah , they didn &apos;t walk home with us .
i just thought he was showing her around .
her who ? her , callie , her ?
that &apos;s not like him .
he knows he has the music thing tonight .
i know it &apos;s not .
i don &apos;t know who this girl is ,
or why you guys feel like you have to
take in strays like some damn homeless shelter .
so , where the hell are they ?
he &apos;s not answering . i &apos;m going to try talya .
look , i &apos;m sure he &apos;s fine .
he probably thought we were going to meet him at the contest .
why don &apos;t i just head over there and check it out ?
hey , have you seen brandon ?
wait a minute , wait a minute .
i had this app installed on all of our phones
yes ?
that one kept losing his .
ok . she says the last time she saw him ,
he was talking to callie after seventh period .
maybe he &apos;s right . maybe we &apos;re just overreacting .
if we &apos;re overreacting , what are they doing in san ysidro ?
what ?
are they going to tijuana ?
i &apos;m going to kill him .
this is exactly what i was worried about .
let &apos;s go .
i &apos;ll drive .
hey , brandon and callie are missing .

i was just asking .
well , ask brandon or callie .
excuse me , i &apos;ve got to go .
is that how you got all that money ?
you selling my pills ?
no .
&apos;cause i know sure as hell
you didn &apos;t get all that money from mom .
or maybe you did ? maybe we should ask her .

you could go to jail for that .
what do you need all that money for anyway ?
i &apos;ve been talking to ana .
ana ?
our ... birth mom ?
she got back in town last month . i found her online .

sticking their noses all up in my business , ok ?
they wouldn &apos;t get it . ana needs some money ... i just ...
you &apos;re giving her money ? for what ? why ?
see , i knew you wouldn &apos;t understand .
understand ?
you want me to understand why this woman is not our mom ?
she left her two kids so she can run off with a dumb ass
and screw who ever she wanted .
she abandoned us . she left us .
well , she came back .
