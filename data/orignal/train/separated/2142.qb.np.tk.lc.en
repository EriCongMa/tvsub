i have a completely unscientific theory
that the ability to put the week behind you
is directly related to how much alcohol you consume .
is that right ?
what are you drinking ?
very powerful ... club soda .
club soda &apos;s not part of my theory .
two belvederes on the rocks .
i &apos;m allison .
i &apos;m david .
and , uh , i &apos;m also meeting someone .
then i &apos;ll stay just long enough to make her jealous .
thank you .
to your theory .
tom matthews . lieutenant commander steve mcgarrett
and detective danny williams from five @-@ o.
tom is running security on the foreign aid summit .
all right . what do we know about this victim ?
his name is david atwater .
he was a diplomatic service agent
assigned to general pak &apos;s advance team .
general pak is arriving today from sandimar
for the aid signing .
and a lot of people do not want general pak here .
yeah , from what i &apos;ve seen on the news ,
a lot of people don &apos;t want him alive .
atwater was on the trail of one of these people .
he called tom just a few hours before his death ,
saying that he had information about an assassination plot .
why didn &apos;t he give details over the phone ?
said we had to meet .
we were scheduled to do that at the hotel bar last night .
atwater didn &apos;t show .
i went to his room and found his body .
so you got the call and you found the body ?
if you want to waste what little time we have investigating me ,
detective williams , go ahead .
i &apos;ll be in my office . gentlemen .
whatever the threat assessment was , it &apos;s now changed .
why don &apos;t we just postpone the general &apos;s trip ?
it is critical that general pak attend the summit , mcgarrett .
that &apos;s why the governor has you on this .
you are to find atwater &apos;s killer
and assist in protecting general pak
and his family when they arrive .
i &apos;m sorry , did you say &quot; assist &quot; ? who am i assisting ?
uh , this is ...
no way !
what &apos;s up , bullfrog ?
smooth dog .
been a while .
it &apos;s been a long time , man .
uh , nick ,
nick served under me in the seals .
and three years in the &apos; stan .
the &apos; stan ? what is the &apos; stan ?
afghanistan .
nick , this is my partner danny williams .
how you doing ?
good . how are you ?
i figured you &apos;d reenlist until your mandatory .
when did you get out ?
two years ago .
i got my own shop now .
after last night &apos;s security breach ,
the sandimar government decided
to beef up their protective detail .
they hired nick &apos;s firm
to protect general pak and his family .
of course they did .
wow . so you got genocide , ethnic cleansing .
it &apos;s a great client you got .
well , you know , my team and i
are here to do a job , just like you .
no , no , not @-@ not just like me .
see , i &apos;m a cop . i don &apos;t get to choose who i protect .
you do , and you choose this animal , and i &apos;m sure
our pay grades , our rates
are a little different .
okay , enough .
just ... i mean ...
enough .
i &apos;m going to do a dry run ,
map out the a.o. and check for choke points .
all right . what are you saying ?
excuse me , can you translate , smooth dog ?
a.o. is the area of operation ,
all the areas we need to put on full lockdown--
general pak &apos;s route from the airport to the summit site .
choke points are areas where
the motorcade could get slowed or ambushed .
okay , okay , i got an idea .
if you guys are gonna keep talking like this ,
maybe we get a dictionary .
all right , i &apos;m sorry about him .
it &apos;s good to see you .
i &apos;ll call you later .
all right . all right . hey .
what , are you jealous ?
no .
it was jealousy .
no !
you don &apos;t like him , do you ?
what gave it away ?
you didn &apos;t like me at first , either .
let me explain something to you :
i will never like that cheeseball .
okay , i get that you were built without a censor button ,
but if we have to go to guns on this case ,
you &apos;re going to be happy that he &apos;s on our side .
okay , if we have to go to guns on this case ,
happy is not one of the emotions i will be expressing ,
okay ?
a guy gets murdered
right before he &apos;s about to blow the top off of
an assassination plot .
killer thinks that now
nothing &apos;s standing in his way .
yeah , except us .
no foreign dignitary has ever been killed on u.s. soil ,
and general pak is not about to be the first .
okay , kid ,
walk me through it .
carotid was severed .
arterial spray on the wall .
good . what else ?
okay , no forced entry .
no signs of a struggle .
by the looks of it ,
i &apos;d say agent atwater invited his killer in .
also got a shoe print .
about a size six .
spiked heel .
looks like our killer was female .
maika &apos;i loa , rookie .
that &apos;s them in the top corner .
oh , look , she bought him a drink .
you never had that happen ?
once . niagara falls .
oh . can you forward the tape , please ?
tell me something : why would a trained agent ,
even off @-@ duty , hook up with a random woman
while he &apos;s on assignment ?
i don &apos;t know .
lonely people do stupid things .
can you follow them ?
here they are in the elevator , and ...
here they are in the hallway .
check it out . i mean ,
the camera never gets a full shot of her face .
she knows all the blind spots .
our girl did her homework .
wait a minute . go back , go back . rewind the tape five seconds .
and zoom in .
look at that ... his hand &apos;s shaking .
yeah , it &apos;s performance anxiety .
also niagara falls .
can you rewind the tape back to the bar ?
wait , wait , wait , go back , go back , go back .
zoom in .
look at that .
she dropped something in his drink .
that &apos;s a roofie .
no , in small quantities , ghb is an aphrodisiac .
that would explain
the animal kingdom behavior in the hallway .
yeah , it would also explain him skipping a meeting
that he set about an impending assassination attempt .
here &apos;s a question ,
anything about this case bother you ?
everything about this case bothers me .
i mean , why not kill the general in sandimar ?
well , if it was me ,
i &apos;d want to hit the general where his security detail is weakest ,
and in sandimar , he &apos;s surrounded by an army .
i mean , the general never leaves sandimar ,
so if they don &apos;t get him here ,
they don &apos;t get him .
which means we have to find atwater &apos;s killer
before that happens .
what is that ?
what &apos;s what ?
that .
that is a picture of grace .
no , not that . that .
oh , that &apos;s a visual aid .
just a reminder of a better place .
a visual aid ?
yeah .
danny , this is a postcard of new jersey .
i know exactly what it is , i bought it all right ?
what , you want to hear me say it ? i &apos;m not afraid to say it .
i miss home . i &apos;m a little homesick , okay ?
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay to be homesick .
i miss sal &apos;s steak house .
i miss frankie &apos;s . i miss manny &apos;s .
do you realize how much of your life revolves around food ?
do you realize how much your life
revolves around armed conflict ?
let me ask you a question .
where do people from new jersey vacation ?
um , i don &apos;t know .
i @-@ i would imagine they vacation
all over the place .
okay . and you &apos;re ...
you &apos;re aware the fact that perhaps many people
from new jersey vacation here in hawaii ?
i &apos;m sure some misguided people do , sure , yeah .
okay , good . and how many hawaiians do
you think vacation in new jersey ?
i don &apos;t know .
i can help you with that answer if you want .
the answer is zero , danny ,
because nobody here , except you
wants to be there , okay ?
because aside from a couple of great singers ,
new jersey doesn &apos;t exactly scream ...
whoa , a few great singers ?
sinatra , springsteen ...
right .
a few great sing ... jonathan bon jovi .
i &apos;m sorry , bon jovi ?
absolutely bon jovi .
you serious ?
he &apos;s right up there . &quot; you give love a bad name , &quot;
&quot; wanted dead or alive , &quot;
now you &apos;re giving me song titles .
i love it .
i &apos;m giving you classic song titles .
look , all i &apos;m saying is , it &apos;s cool with me
if you want to have a photo of grace , okay ,
but any other additions and decorations to the interior
of this vehicle should be treated like a wiretap
request where you need my authorization .
you can ride in the trunk if you don &apos;t like it .
i &apos;ll get real jersey up in this piece .
look at this .
general pak &apos;s got a fan club .
this makes me so sick .
we might have to take a bullet for this guy .
if we do our job right ,
that &apos;s not going to happen .
even if we get her , i mean ,
what are the chances she &apos;s working alone ?
not only are we going to find her , we &apos;re going to find her ,
and then we &apos;re going to squeeze her to flip on her partners .
yeah , well , i just want you to know something .
when i took an oath to protect people ,
general pak is not who i had in mind .
me , either .
we pulled a partial print
off the &quot; do not disturb &quot; sign she touched .
everything else appeared to be wiped down .
we ran it . no hits in the system yet , though .
what &apos;s all this ?
well , you mentioned on the phone that you didn &apos;t have
a clean , full shot of the assassin &apos;s face ,
so i built one .
i pulled two different camera stills off the security footage .
this left full profile is from the bar ,
and this right profile
is when they exited the elevator .
i grabbed bits and pieces from other shots
and added them to the two base images
and created a composite .
wow . nice work .
the guy built a face .
okay , listen .
add the prints you pulled and circulate this picture to hpd ,
ncic , fbi , interpol
and airport and marina securities .
kono , keep digging into general pak &apos;s background .
i want to know if he has any enemies at home
who may want to target him here .
we also need a list of protestors that were
at the summit that hpd has on a watch list for making threats .
i &apos;ll do that .
just remember , general pak has a lot of people who hate him ,
so don &apos;t confuse making a threat with being one .
forget the cranks and focus on the people
who actually have the means to pull something like this off .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m going to go back
to the summit , review site protection with taylor .
call me if you get anything .
you got it .
chin , what &apos;s up ?
a parking valet at the hotel recognized that woman
from the picture i composited .
he says he remembers her
not only because she was uniquely beautiful ,
but also because she pulled up in a battered old ford taurus ,
slipped him $ 50 and asked him to keep it out front .
according to him , it was an interesting paradox .
okay , tell me you got a plate .
yeah , i did .
hotel logs plates whenever a car checks in .
it &apos;s for insurance purposes .
i &apos;m heading to the house now with hpd backup .
perfect . i &apos;ll meet you there .
cordon off the neighborhood .
set a perimeter around the house .
what &apos;s the address ?
i want her alive .
yes , sir .
clear .
clear .
be aware : suspects may be holding civilians hostage .
house is secure , but you should see this .
looks like enough firepower to take out the general .
and his entire army .
guys , in the garage .
that &apos;s the woman who owns this house .
used dishes in the sink .
two weeks &apos; worth of uncollected mail .
medical examiner thinks that &apos;s how long
the body &apos;s been dead , but he &apos;s got to wait
for it to defrost before he can do the autopsy .
so , our suspect kills the woman , takes her identity
and uses her house as a base of operations .
yeah .
hi . this is margaret .
i &apos;m not home right now .
leave me a message after the beep .
hey , mom . it &apos;s stephanie .
we just got back from spain .
wait till you see the photos .
call me . love you . bye .
call back and make the family notification .
hey , danny just called . he &apos;s at hpd .
he just got a hit on a protest organizer
you &apos;re going to want to take a look at .
his name is nae shan .
former member of general pak &apos;s army .
defected to thailand , and then he came here .
he &apos;s been photographed
at several protests against general pak .
and hpd has him on multiple arrests ,
including weapons sales .
you think this guy might be responsible
for the arsenal in the next room ?
i think whoever &apos;s behind this has to have local help .
let &apos;s go say hello .
watch the door . he comes your way ,
don &apos;t let him get past you .
you got it .
got eyes on him . he &apos;s headed your way .
hey , what &apos;s up , nae shan ?
you got a sec ?
hey ! hey ! kono !
nae shan .
officer kono kalakaua . how you doing today ?
why did you run ?
i don &apos;t like police .
that &apos;s original .
i &apos;m going to ask you questions .
you &apos;re going to give me answers .
if you lie to me , i &apos;m going to throw
you and your family in an ins holding tank ,
and then i &apos;m going to deport you back to sandimar .
you understand ?
good .
you &apos;re a person of interest
in an assassination plot against general pak .
you think i want to kill general pak ?
i want to see him brought before an international court of justice .
i want to see him humiliated .
death is too easy for general pak .
he must admit what he did .
what did he do to you ?
general pak &apos;s soldiers came in the morning
when we were working in the fields .
they set fire to our houses , our crops .
they burned everything .
they shot two young men
because they said they were guerrillas .
they were just boys .
when we tried to run , but they rounded us up
and forced us to walk across a field .
they blindfolded the machine gunners .
it was a game to them .
they did not even aim . they just pulled the triggers .
the officers laughed .
i watched as my oldest son and my sister ...
i cannot close my eyes without seeing .
now , those of us who were able
to walk clear went into the jungle , toward the border .
we walked for ten days with no food for the children ,
no medicine for the injured .
many died .
and we were not the only village .
there were many .
a million people living in the jungle like animals .
i hate general pak , but i am no murderer .
what did she just say ?
she wants to know why the police
are protecting a monster like general pak .
she asked how a man can do that
and still call himself a man .
what is it with you ? what do you do ?
you attract conflict ?
i &apos;ve been gone for two hours ,
and you have conducted two raids .
what do you got planned for lunch ?
did you run nae shan &apos;s alibi ?
yeah , he &apos;s clean . he checks out .
what is ... what ... what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m running additional background on agent atwater .
something doesn &apos;t make sense .
okay , just please stop for a second .
now , we have a room full of guns .
all right , we need to be looking for the people
that were hired to fire them ,
not investigating their murder victim ,
who &apos;s a decorated agent with a spotless record .
so tell me ... how does your decorated agent
know about this assassination plot ?
i don &apos;t know , okay ?
same way we would ... an investigation , an informant .
no . matthews said that nobody
on the detail authorized an investigation .
and if it was an informant ,
why didn &apos;t he download matthews on the first call ?
why demand a face @-@ to @-@ face ?
i don &apos;t know ... because he didn &apos;t want to relay
that kind of information over the phone . all right ?
atwater said that he wanted to meet matthews alone .
all right , maybe he was going to report
a threat inside the protective detail .
maybe it was someone he knew , maybe a friend .
all right , or maybe atwater was the inside man ...
part of the team behind this room full of guns
that are going to be used for the assassination .
we have zero evidence connecting atwater to this plot .
but why kill him ?
he &apos;s not running the detail .
he didn &apos;t set the route .
i mean , atwater is an advance man .
what made agent david atwater so dangerous to these people
that they had him killed
before general pak arrived ?
wait a minute . hold on . this hurts my head .
all right , if you &apos;re right and atwater was compromised ,
the only reason that he would call matthews ...
... is to come clean , turn himself in .
kill him before he can reveal the how and where .
you &apos;re good .
i know .
no luck with the assassin &apos;s photo canvass .
no hits at the airport or marinas yet .
prints from the hotel room
match prints from the dead woman &apos;s home .
it &apos;s the same killer .
and we also got a hit from the interpol red notice .
cia .
it &apos;s a locked nfn file-- national security .
even you don &apos;t have the clearance required to view it .
oh , good . so the killer &apos;s cia ?
ex @-@ cia would be my bet .
so does anyone know anyone that can open a locked cia file ?
i might .
nick , we ran the assassin &apos;s prints
and composite through the databases and got a hit .
got a hit at langley .
langley ?
how long was she with the company ?
we don &apos;t know anything about her .
i mean , it &apos;s a locked file .
but , uh , was kinda hoping you could help .
a locked file goes all the way to the top ,
but i may know someone that can unlock it .
i &apos;ll make a call .
come here for a second .
i mean , it must be really nice
having friends that can open a top secret cia black file .
yeah , it is .
i &apos;m sorry . is there a question ?
what do you want to know ?
who is that guy ?
before he worked private security ,
nick was special activities division .
special activities ? what kind of special activities did he do ?
sad is the military arm of the cia .
oh , really ?
i thought you guys were navy seals ?
when you have certain specialties ,
you can be recruited into different units as needed .
are you gonna answer any one of my questions ?
what do you want to know ?
what was his specialty ?
it &apos;s classified information , danny .
okay . what was your specialty ?
i can &apos;t tell you that either .
okay , please , you have done this before . where was that ?
when exactly was that ?
i worked the other side .
the other side &apos;s a sniper rifle .
was that your specialty ?
her name is erica raines .
she was with the company for nine years .
recruited right out of college .
a virtual ghost in the community .
she &apos;s a mechanic and a very good one .
a mechanic ?
an assassin .
mechanic .
okay , look. can you just do me a favor and just stop ?
all right ?
from now on , the company is the cia . right ?
the mechanic is the assassin , and please ,
let &apos;s stop referring to what you people do as &quot; the community . &quot;
you &apos;re not a community .
the amish people , they have a community .
let &apos;s just say what things are , please ?
she specialized in seducing her targets and killing &apos; em .
she had an op go bad in jordan ,
went off the grid for two years .
next time she appeared on the agency &apos;s radar she was a gun
for hire with no loyalty to any government or organization .
oh , good , maybe we can hire her to kill herself .
we got a hit on our picture canvass .
she &apos;s been spotted at aloha tower
buying a ticket for josephine cruise lines .
okay , so she &apos;s trying to escape to another island .
and fly out from there .
we need her alive .
she &apos;s our only link to whoever &apos;s behind this assassination plot .
i got her . i got her .
show me your hands !
show me your hands .
she &apos;s dead .
let me ask you a question :
what kind of an animal brings his wife and his kid to a place
where he knows people are trying to kill him ?
the kind that loves a good photo op .
yeah . he wants people to see him as a father and husband ,
not a mass murderer .
hey , did you get anything off the assassin &apos;s phone ?
no . hpd &apos;s scrubbing it now .
all right , look sharp .
are you sure ?
what &apos;s up ?
mcgarrett .
the phone dump on the assassin &apos;s cell phone just came back .
after she murdered agent atwater ,
she dialed nick taylor .
taylor ?
mike , the next right .
sir ?
take the next right !
we &apos;re compromised .
get ready .
go , go , go , go !
steve , give him to me and no one else gets hurt .
not gonna happen .
chin , take out the engine !
guys , get in the car ! come on ! let &apos;s go !
you okay ?
let &apos;s go !
she bad ?
she &apos;ll live .
drive ! drive ! drive ! drive ! go !
hey , what are we doing here ?
this is the closest and safest place i know .
we &apos;re gonna hole up here until hpd swat arrives .
taylor ever been here ?
never .
all right , kono , there &apos;s a first @-@ aid kit in the kitchen .
get it and do what you can .
okay .
danny , secure the back door .
hey , look , everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
this is steve mcgarrett , five @-@ o.
i got shots fired .
multiple agents down at scene : mokulua drive .
send hpd swat to 2727 piikoi street .
inform all hpd officers that nick taylor is the target .
yeah , he &apos;s armed . he &apos;s extremely dangerous .
won &apos;t be long .
you saved my life .
your team saved my family . why ?
it &apos;s my job .
do me a favor , stand over there .
hey , what &apos;s your name ?
tun .
tun . i like that name .
hey , tun , can i tell you a secret ?
i &apos;m scared , too .
you have a gun .
why are you scared ?
just &apos; cause i have a gun
doesn &apos;t mean i don &apos;t get scared .
my father would be angry with me .
i am not being a strong man .
hey , when all those people started shooting ,
you didn &apos;t even cry .
and you never left your mommy &apos;s side .
you made sure she was safe .
that makes you
a very strong man , tun .
i &apos;m gonna be right over there .
if you need anything , you let me know , okay ?
okay .
help will be here , soon .
why do you think i brought my family here ?
i don &apos;t know .
because you &apos;re a mass murderer ? who cares ?
my family &apos;s here because i &apos;m seeking political asylum .
that &apos;s why you couldn &apos;t postpone the trip .
that &apos;s why everybody &apos;s trying to kill you .
let me get this straight .
so you commit all these horrible , horrible crimes ,
and then you come over to the united states , and you say ,
&quot; hey , i &apos;d like to make a deal now . please . &quot;
i &apos;m going to testify at the u.n.
against a military junta and my chairman .
i am going to admit to the world
what i &apos;ve done and pay for the crimes i &apos;ve committed .
well , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s good , man .
you should &apos;ve told us , okay ?
somebody should have told us .
the information was too dangerous .
that information is more dangerous if i don &apos;t have it !
my entire team could have been killed .
not to mention your family .
my testimony will end the war !
the suffering .
you save me , and my family ,
and you save a country .
it &apos;s hpd .
those aren &apos;t cops !
danny , get away from the door .
get away from the door !
back off . back off .
where are the police ?
where is help ? where &apos;s help ?
help &apos;s not coming .
how the hell did they know we &apos;re here ?
my cell phone is dead .
same . internet , too .
everything &apos;s dead .
i got full bars .
wait a minute .
taylor &apos;s killed your signals , and he &apos;s cloned mine .
what ?
he &apos;s cloned my cell phone .
before , i wasn &apos;t talking to 911 operators ,
i was talking to his team .
hpd has no idea where we are .
i told you that i hated that guy .
danny , take the upstairs .
chin , get the gas can off the bench in the shed .
general , bring your family .
no matter what happens , no matter what you hear ,
you stay in this room , you understand ?
yes .
let &apos;s go .
kono , find me some rags .
i &apos;m going to head up with danny .
go .
agent atwater ...
was working with us for months .
he was fully prepared
to kill the general for money , but ...
he drew the line at his wife and child .
i don &apos;t share that conflict .
how about you , steve ?
you son of a bitch .
are you really prepared to sacrifice your entire team
and a woman and child , for a corrupt general
who &apos;s killed thousands of innocent people ?
i fought beside you , nick .
for years .
we were friends .
that &apos;s the only reason you &apos;re still alive .
give me the general and no one else has to get hurt .
that &apos;s not going to happen .
well , then , everyone in that house is dead .
what happened to you , nick ?
i killed for god and country for years .
i figured it was about time i got paid for it .
$ 9 million to keep pak from testifying .
i &apos;ll cut you in , steve .
all you got to do is put a bullet in him .
you know what ? i &apos;ll put a bullet in you first . how &apos;s that ?
well , i &apos;m glad to see civilian life
hasn &apos;t dulled your sense of humor .
you trained me , remember ?
i know your moves .
why don &apos;t you come down here .
i &apos;ll show you a couple of moves you missed .
should have taken the deal .
by the way , that &apos;s a nasty cut on your eye .
he &apos;s to the north , maybe 300 meters .
stay down . he &apos;s not going to miss again .
they &apos;re almost at the door .
this &apos;ll slow them down .
go , kono , go !
i &apos;m out .
here they come !
definitely the fall that killed him .
yeah . definitely .
you stay here .
hpd &apos;s here .
chin . kono .
go check on the general and his family .
you have got to start doing a better job
of picking your friends .
tell me about . i picked you , didn &apos;t i ?
yeah .
general .
i will accept whatever punishment
the international court hands down for my crimes .
today is the first day my son is proud of his father .
thank you .
you okay ?
yeah .
i should &apos;ve known .
no , you shouldn &apos;t have . how could you have known ?
you knew .
no , no , no . i suspected . there &apos;s a big difference .
and the view is a lot different from where i was standing .
this guy taylor was your friend .
he used that to his advantage .
but this is really , really good news .
i mean , you are a human being .
which is good news to me , because i had no idea .
well ... you got good instincts , partner .
longboards on me ?
absolutely .
can i see your wallet , please ?
well , last time you offered to buy me a drink ,
you conveniently left your wallet
and i got stuck for the ...
you don &apos;t have your wallet , do you ?
