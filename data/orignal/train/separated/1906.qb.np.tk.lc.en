the waiting can kill you .
you make a decision ,
and then the world has to turn .
the consequences unfold ...
out of your hands .
there &apos;s only one thing that seems clear ...
in those quiet moments while you wait .
whatever you chose was wrong .
you think he put you in his will ?
no .
next of kin .
maybe you get the house .
i have a house .
well , you can give me his house . i mean , i could use a house .
he &apos;s not my father .
i &apos;ve been telling him this for years .
he just feels guilty
because he busted up my parents &apos; marriage .
that &apos;s not my problem .
it is now .
yeah , i mean , sticking me with his end of life care--
doesn &apos;t ask , doesn &apos;t give me an out--
that &apos;s real love .
well , it sounds like family to me .
maybe he is your father . banged your mom enough .
alex .
did they know each other before you were born ?
they met when i was 3 .
mm @-@ hmm . yeah . that &apos;s what they told you .
i gotta get back to the e.r.
ow . oh , no , no . let me get it .
this is yang .
and how about brooks ?
i know . i &apos;m fine .
hey , look . i need to run to my nec fasc surgery .
he &apos;s in cardiogenic shock .
no .
bailey feels like there &apos;s likely some internal necrosis .
so she took him up to the o.r.
with this kind of cardiac compromise ?
yeah--and she--
unh @-@ unh . she--mom . mom ?
look ...
i need hunt in here .
i can try to--
now !
ready ? go . two , three ...
bowels are completely clean .
should we recheck the pelvis ?
i have , four times .
what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing--
cutting open a man in cardiogenic shock
with nothing on his c.t. ?
there &apos;s dead tissue somewhere inside him .
i &apos;d like to find it before it kills him .
he can &apos;t handle this stress
until his cardiac status is stabilized !
get him off that table !
lap pad , please .
dr. hunt !
dr. avery , i &apos;m gonna have to ask you
to keep it down while we &apos;re doing our work .
huh , there &apos;s a surprise for you .
pressure &apos;s dropping . is his dopamine maxed out ?
yeah , it &apos;s at 20 .
close the patient !
come on . where are you ?
dr. hunt ! brooks is crashing .
bailey , he &apos;s having runs of v @-@ tach .
close ... him ... up !
closing .
can you get by without me ?
just go .
hey , how &apos;s it going with brooks ?
hey , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
you gotta drink the juice , man .
you give us half your blood and head back to the pile ,
you &apos;re gonna pass out .
heather didn &apos;t make it .
come on .
i &apos;m gonna give the interns the rest of the night off .
can you give me a hand if there &apos;s anything they drop ?
of course .
i &apos;m so sorry about heather .
yeah .
dr. hunt , lydia &apos;s desatting ,
decreased breath sounds on the left .
wha--
sharpie lady .
oh . should i throw in a chest tube ?
dr. yang is gonna take over that case .
why ? i can handle a chest tube .
oh , my god .
i got a woman with necrotizing fasciitis ,
and the interns aren &apos;t operating .
so can you--
of course .
well , she &apos;s already on the table ,
and the anesthesiologists are lining her up .
be ready in ten .
okay . hey ...
it &apos;s just terrible .
jackson .
oh , hey . i &apos;m sorry .
and what about richard ?
still critical ,
but his pressure stabilized once bailey closed .
so bailey closed because his vitals tanked ,
or because catherine avery was in the gallery screaming ?
oh , derek .
you heard about brooks ?
i can &apos;t believe it .
can we have a conversation ?
not now .
i know you &apos;re mad .
and telling everyone-- i guess ...
i deserved that .
but we could just--
i said not now .
hey , it &apos;s right behind me !
are you headed back out ?
be careful , okay ?
it was avery , right ?
he &apos;s the guy that you ...
i get it . he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy .
practically runs the hospital .
matthew--
and i proposed to you in front of a hundred people .
i didn &apos;t really give you the opportunity to say &quot; no . &quot;
so ...
did you want to say &quot; no &quot; ?
callie ?
callie ?
callie ? !
we got the clot out ,
but there was just so much swelling .
couldn &apos;t get it to stop .
did you tell the family ?
yeah , i had someone call her mom when we found her
and tell her that she was injured .
she &apos;s coming down from someplace in oregon .
i just didn &apos;t want to tell her
when she was still on the road .
okay , so you need to go to the day care
and pick up zola because she &apos;s gonna think
we had a baby and forgot about her .
i &apos;ll call the babysitter and tell her
to meet you at the house in an hour .
and you should tell the interns
to hang out and wait till heather &apos;s mom arrives .
give me the baby .
okay .
i know .
that is a lot of blood .
should i book an o.r. ?
no , not yet .
we &apos;ll monitor her for the next couple of hours
and then decide .
my--my house .
ma &apos;am , you &apos;ve lost quite a lot of blood .
you should rest .
i @-@ i wouldn &apos;t worry about the house right now .
you can &apos;t scream at my doctors when there is
an open body on the table .
i can &apos;t believe you let her talk you into
a boondoggle like that .
dr. avery , if you have any issues with--
does he know why you cut open a man in severe cardiac distress
just so you could poke around and see what &apos;s going on ?
we looked at all of the options .
tell him .
you tell him you feel guilty
because the last thing richard webber heard from you
is that he &apos;s a drunk who ruined your life ,
after all he &apos;s done for you .
we talk on the phone for an hour every night .
it came up .
you feel bad , go find a priest .
but do not try to fix it with a hail mary .
that very well may kill the man !
i want acces to his charts ... right now .
i &apos;ll be back in about an hour .
heather &apos;s mother won &apos;t probably be here yet ,
but if she is , uh , someone stay with her
until i get back .
we don &apos;t tell her , do we ?
no , i will .
just think of some good heather stories .
once she knows ,
she &apos;s gonna want to know that she died among friends .
who &apos;s gonna wait ?
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t . she &apos;ll see it in my face .
what the hell is his problem ? it &apos;s not like they were friends .
i am not waiting with her alone .
i &apos;m not either .
okay . nobody goes . we all wait .
now go find shane and tell him we &apos;re doing this together .
what are you , my mother ? you find him .
yes , yes , yes .
hey .
hey , can you watch her for a minute ?
yeah .
i need to get my laptop .
come here .
what &apos;s going on ?
my wife &apos;s an s @-@ l @-@ u @-@ t .
sofia and i are spending the night at a hotel .
and then what ?
i don &apos;t know . okay , i &apos;ll be right back .
we &apos;re gonna let her stay at a hotel ?
so is this the woman
whose fiance is also a firefighter ,
but they couldn &apos;t find him for a while ?
yep .
forceps .
wow , this wound is really deep .
to get good margins , we &apos;re gonna have to--
i got it .
you are one sleepy girl .
i &apos;m gonna get you to bed right now .
i was gonna go to a hotel .
but mer said i should come here .
well , i guess i should have read those five text messages .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry . sofia &apos;s asleep in zola &apos;s bed--
and i @-@ i can move her . she--
she probably won &apos;t wake up .
yeah , okay .
catherine may be right . i mean , it &apos;s possible
i &apos;m too close to this to see it clearly .
am i supposed to be seeing this clearly ?
well , yang was advocating for a more conservative approach .
i guess that &apos;s what we go with .
catherine &apos;s reviewing his chart--
labs , i don &apos;t know .
if she wants to make the decisions ,
then maybe she should .
here you go .
thanks .
hey , how is she doing ?
well , i @-@ i put in the chest tube .
one of her broken ribs sliced into her lung .
so , i mean , she put out a lot of blood .
we &apos;re watching her .
okay .
how are you ?
fabulous .
yeah .
what ?
nothing .
what ?
i @-@ i just ...
i wish i had known it was gonna be
the last time you and i were together .
i would have done things a little differently .
well , was the last time bad ?
no , the last time was wednesday ,
when we knocked that plate off the counter ,
and i spent half the night pulling shards of glass
out of your foot .
that was not the last time .
it was ?
not our best work .
well , that &apos;s awful .
after the kind of run we had ...
it &apos;s just a shame .
shameful .
everyone i love either cheats on me or dies .
callie ...
or cheats on me and dies .
george did both .
arizona &apos;s not gonna die .
yeah , that doesn &apos;t make me feel any better .
ugh . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m drinking all your wine .
you should be drinking all your wine
after what you went through tonight with heather and ...
and richard , oh , my god !
why is everything so horrible ?
please , it &apos;s okay . go ahead .
it &apos;s all yours .
okay .
i &apos;ll open another bottle .
just page her !
i can &apos;t page someone 911 without the name of the patient--
andrea .
when dr. torres calls in , she &apos;ll expect to know who--
no , there &apos;s no patient . just page her .
we can &apos;t page 911 without a patient emergency .
look at me . does it look like this is not an emergency ?
hey , hey ! what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i need you to page callie 911 .
why ?
because she took off with my baby ,
and i don &apos;t know where ,
and when i call her , she doesn &apos;t pick up .
all right , did she ...
no , just do it !
so we were able to remove all of the necrotic tissue ,
but the labs suggest
that your organs are beginning to fail .
well , is there anything that you can do ?
well , we &apos;re giving you some powerful antibiotics .
and we &apos;re hoping that that stops the process .
but ...
but i might not make it .
we are going to do everything that we possibly can .
bri ...
we want to get married now .
right now no matter what happens ,
we want to be married .
we need a chaplain .
hey , bailey .
arizona is in the lobby
screaming at nurses .
why ?
&apos;cause she has no idea where callie is ...
or the baby .
oh , well , you need to tell her they &apos;re at my house .
callie &apos;s not a battered woman .
we &apos;re not harboring her until she gets a restraining order .
she just wants some space .
but you don &apos;t think arizona &apos;s called her ,
like , 300 times ?
if callie wanted her to know where she was ,
she &apos;d have-- she &apos;d have told her .
you think it &apos;s okay that arizona
doesn &apos;t know where her baby is ?
she &apos;s sofia &apos;s mom , too .
they &apos;re both our friends .
you know , we shouldn &apos;t take sides .
it &apos;s not taking sides to tell arizona where her kid is .
oh , you think that &apos;s how it &apos;s gonna go ?
what happened to your hair ?
she wasn &apos;t funny funny , but she was weird funny .
we &apos;re not saying that to her mom .
remember when she swallowed that marble ?
we could talk about that .
her mom knows she swallowed a marble , idiot .
you know what ?
when you have a better idea , you let me know .
you were her roommate .
how do you not have a single nice story about her ?
she took my white sweater and returned it pink .
she left the apartment without waking me up
when we both had rounds , which she knew about and said ,
&quot; i didn &apos;t want to bother you . you looked so peaceful . &quot;
she &apos;d drink all the milk
and return the empty carton back in the fridge .
then why are you all red @-@ eyed and puffy ?
we weren &apos;t soul mates .
it doesn &apos;t mean i wanted her dead .
what &apos;s going on with the baby ?
oh , nothing . he &apos;s fine .
they have him in the nursery .
oh . oh . i thought--
i thought something happened .
no , no .
i paged you because i wanted to let you know
that callie and sofia are going to stay at my place tonight .
i think she just needs some space .
she needs to cool off . and ... i know
you &apos;re not gonna go run over there or anything ,
but i just thought you would like to know
that she and the baby are--
arizona .
arizona ? !
is &quot; i told you so &quot; inappropriate ?
shut it .
come on . what about ... hassan ?
he &apos;s out at the pile , too ?
you realize they can &apos;t all be out at the damn pile .
no , i don &apos;t care what religion they are .
just give me somebody--anybody that can officiate this--
yeah , as a member of the board , i &apos;m gonna say
you want to stay away from phrases like ,
&quot; even a catholic . &quot;
all right , uh , just call me back .
how is richard ?
hanging by a thread . thank you very much .
you gonna scream at me , too , now ?
i heard you already had a go at hunt and bailey .
i just wanna know what in god &apos;s name
was going on through your head--
stop !
you are terrified . i get that .
you love him .
and you are as scared as you have ever been .
marching through this hospital
telling everybody they are incompetent
is not gonna fix that situation .
we are all doing our best .
and we are gonna take good care of him .
and we ... are gonna take good care of you .
okay ?
as soon as he &apos;s stable ...
as soon as the storm passes ,
i &apos;m going to move him to another hospital .
i &apos;m gonna do a thoracotomy on lydia .
just waiting for an o.r. to open up .
okay .
so thanks for ... before .
&quot; thanks &quot; ?
are you gonna send a card on pretty stationery ?
i &apos;m just glad ...
that we &apos;ve given each other a better last memory .
what ?
i don &apos;t know .
if we &apos;d really thought it through ,
then for the last time we &apos;d have--
what ?
is he in there ?
i can &apos;t see anything .
keep your voices down . she &apos;s sleeping .
no , she &apos;s not .
oh . sorry , um ,
we were just looking for dr. shepherd .
he &apos;s not here .
he &apos;ll be back . he went to take zola home .
what do you need ?
he asked us to come up with something nice to say
about heather to her mom for after she knows .
we &apos;re having trouble coming up with
something that &apos;s appropriate .
we were thinking if we looked at
some of the cases she worked on with dr. shepherd ,
we could talk about those .
her mother is not gonna give a crap
about her glioblastoma .
she wants to hear about how you loved her
and how she was like your family .
nothing ?
doesn &apos;t have to be deep .
when my friend george died , i told his mother a story
about how he stole us all jell @-@ o cups .
and then he dropped them all over the floor
and made a huge mess .
and then he tried to clean it up
with those blue bed pads , which only made it worse
because , of course , those blue bed pads
aren &apos;t absorbent at all .
it &apos;s not a sonnet , but it made her smile .
and then she went back to crying .
okay .
asleep ?
what do you think ?
my mother &apos;s planning on moving richard to another hospital .
what ?
i know .
i know you weren &apos;t sure about how to handle
richard &apos;s medical decisions , but i &apos;m just telling you ,
you turn the reins over to her ,
that &apos;s exactly what she &apos;s gonna do with them .
okay ... get me a wheelchair .
you just had a splenectomy and a child .
i &apos;m not putting you in a wheelchair .
jackson , just get me a wheelchair .
there are no chaplains anywhere in the building .
everyone is out dealing with storm victims .
we have storm victims right here .
what--chaplains are supposed to stay here !
anybody seen my patient brian ?
firefighter , busted ribs ...
yeah , he &apos;s getting married .
not without a chaplain , he &apos;s not .
well , i can go online and get certified by
that place on the internet , but me and weddings ,
today-- i don &apos;t think that i &apos;m the best choice .
the damn firefighters keep taking off--injured .
if you see any of them ,
tell them to stay in their damn beds .
kepner .
what ?
get me a wheelchair .
april !
i don &apos;t think we can be friends .
really ?
this will keep happening .
i ...
really wanted to be able to work with you .
yeah , of course .
but if we ...
you know , talk on the phone or ...
grab lunch ...
just because i &apos;m the one
who said it was time ...
doesn &apos;t mean this is easy for me .
i know .
this is not easy for me .
what do you really believe
is the best course of treatment ?
it &apos;s not that simple .
yes , it is .
you always taught us , when you know , you know .
i think there is something in there ,
and no matter how much it stresses his heart ,
i think letting it get worse is worse .
hi . this is dr. grey .
i need to book an o.r. for an exploratory laparotomy .
surgeon is bailey .
patient is webber .
they &apos;re opening him up again .
yep . don &apos;t say anything .
i &apos;m not .
she thought it was a stupid idea the first time
and even more stupid the second time .
you &apos;re the one who has to decide
what richard would want . wouldn &apos;t want to be you .
thanks .
but to be clear ,
when you &apos;re making these decisions for me ,
give my heart at least 24 hours to recover
before you cut me stem to stern .
you just couldn &apos;t hold it in , could you ?
wait , she &apos;s your health care proxy ?
i get to make the decisions for everyone .
not qwen ?
no .
who &apos;s yours ?
i never filled out the forms .
i had the papers back when it was gonna be izzie .
that was a bad plan .
that was all a bad plan .
why do you think i never turned them in ?
mer could be yours , too .
you think i make the wrong decisions all the time .
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re selling me to him .
will you stop being so insecure ?
just because i disagree with you
doesn &apos;t mean i don &apos;t respect what you think .
i can hold more than one point of view in my mind .
i am mature .
i don &apos;t believe you .
you can be mine .
health care proxy ? really ?
i mean , mer &apos;s got enough to take care of .
you want extraordinary measures
or should i just unplug you ?
use your judgment .
sharpie lady &apos;s ready .
mom !
you knew they were taking him back into the o.r. ?
right , now you can &apos;t march in there and shut &apos; em down .
the hell i can &apos;t .
he didn &apos;t choose you to make his decisions .
he chose meredith .
how &apos;s the e.r. ?
quiet for a while .
but we got a couple of ambulances on their way in--
people they pulled out of the pile .
can i come ?
no , no . you &apos;re supposed to be working .
i don &apos;t need the night out .
we &apos;re supposed to be sitting around
telling heather stories .
turns out we &apos;re not a very tight group .
you think you &apos;re not .
but when it all hits the fan ...
you &apos;ll be glad you have &apos; em .
someone just died . shouldn &apos;t this be the time ?
come on .
you &apos;re not gonna go cry to them when we break up ...
and you have to move your trash bag full of crap
out of my house ?
okay , one--
i never leave more than a change of underwear
and a toothbrush in anyone else &apos;s house .
that &apos;s smart .
and two--i will have dumped your sorry ass ,
so i &apos;m not gonna be crying .
i &apos;m just gonna feel bad
that i made it so you can never love again .
oh , yeah . it &apos;s gonna be ugly .
but see ...
i &apos;ve got mer and cristina .
i can cry to them .
when the next guy after me breaks your heart ...
i &apos;m gonna want my bitches .
voila ! this--it &apos;ll help .
brian and sasha ...
your commitment
to each other is an inspiration .
your love , your devotion-- it &apos;s unwavering .
you aren &apos;t swayed by anything
that life puts in your path .
when people talk about marriage ,
this is exactly what they oughta have in mind .
i can &apos;t believe i yelled at a woman
who clawed dying victims out of the mud
and triaged them with her bleeding little hands .
super tacky .
i think i &apos;m the worst person i &apos;ve ever met .
shut up .
it speaks .
it wants more booze .
all right .
all right , we all have to focus .
heather .
she was a fine , upstanding citizen
with limitless potential .
you say that to my mom when i &apos;m dead ,
and she &apos;s gonna know you &apos;re lying .
my mom will believe it .
you can say it when i &apos;m dead .
write it down &apos; cause i &apos;m gonna forget .
that i was a nice person ?
how is it that we spend this much time together
and we don &apos;t really know anything about each other ?
so tell us something we don &apos;t know .
about me ?
don &apos;t be shy .
what ?
i can &apos;t .
you guys are gonna hate me more than you already do .
no , we won &apos;t .
circle of trust .
my mom knew mark sloan .
the one who died ?
they , like , dated a hundred years ago or something .
and he kind of helped me get into the program .
what ? !
i knew it .
i knew you didn &apos;t make it in here on your own .
you are such an evil cow .
whatever .
at least i got in here on my own merit .
what happened to the circle of trust ?
i was a street kid .
foster homes , lived in my car .
you were not .
hand to god .
really ? do you know how to pickpocket ?
no . i wasn &apos;t oliver twist .
could you teach me how to shoplift ?
no !
it &apos;ll help me in the o.r. calm hands under pressure .
you couldn &apos;t handle it .
you could .
thank you .
i ... went through college on a cheerleading scholarship .
what ? !
no !
yes .
that is my child !
okay , so i can screw some whore on shore leave ,
but this is over the line ?
i could have called the police on you--
okay , and now she &apos;s your baby .
i had to talk you into even considering having a child .
and i had to talk you into marriage .
yeah , because i knew it would be a mistake .
and you know what ? it was .
you cannot take a baby and just disappear ...
look at the stars and the sky light .
yeah ? yeah , should we go ups--
let &apos;s go to the swing . should we go to the swing ?
okay . go to the swing .
go to the swing . let &apos;s go to the swing .
we are excited , united ...
and here to win the fight .
we &apos;re here to meet you , defeat you ...
we dominate tonight !
tigers ...
tigers ...
tigers .
tigers .
tigers .
excuse me ,
somebody said you might be able to help me
find my daughter
heather brooks .
we have run this bowel four times now ,
and there is nothing there .
i don &apos;t know how much longer we can keep at this .
come on .
i know you &apos;re in there .
owen .
oh , my god .
the pancreas . look at that .
that &apos;s all necrotic tissue hiding underneath .
get her some forceps , please .
and--and a 15 @-@ blade .
here you go , doctor .
somebody call meredith grey up in maternity .
on it .
tell her , &quot; when you know , you know &quot; !
it was a beautiful wedding .
what you said--
can we not ?
why are you snapping at me all day ?
i &apos;m not snapping .
yeah , you are .
i &apos;m sorry i asked the question .
it obviously made you really uncomfortable ,
and i guess that &apos;s my answer .
there &apos;s no need to beat a dead horse .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s supposed to look like , you know .
i mean , they can &apos;t even imagine not being together .
do you see the difference between that
and &quot; i think i &apos;ll marry this guy ,
or maybe i &apos;ll marry that guy ,
who i banged in a bathroom
because i flipped out over my boards ,
but when he was into me , i couldn &apos;t handle it .
but suddenly , when he almost dies ,
i can &apos;t live without him . &quot;
that is so unfair !
it &apos;s what happened !
you didn &apos;t want me when i was okay--
when i wanted you .
no , you just want me now
because you are in something that is real ...
and that--
that scares the crap out of you .
marry this guy because you want to make a life with him ,
or don &apos;t , and move on .
but none of this has to do with me .
no , this is ...
entirely about you .
i &apos;m very sorry about how i spoke to you yesterday .
with the storm and everything , and we &apos;re all just ...
your house ...
it didn &apos;t make it , did it ?
i &apos;m sorry .
you saved a lot of people triaging like you did .
were you a doctor or something ?
no , i &apos;ve just lived on the side of the mountain
for a long time . it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s not our first storm .
an ex @-@ marine showed me how to do it ...
our first mudslide .
oh , i can &apos;t believe i have to build that house again .
maybe you should find someplace else .
no . we &apos;re a few houses on the side of a mountain ,
and we take care of each other .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;d find new friends .
no one else would have me .
she was really good .
fast hands .
one time ...
we &apos;d all been working all night ,
and we were starving ,
and she went to where they make the food trays
for the patients ,
and she stole jell @-@ o cups for all of us .
and they fell all over the floor .
she tried to use one of those blue hospital pads
to clean it up , but it just made it worse .
got everywhere .
jo told heather that
she swiped an apple from a grocery store
when she was a kid .
and heather asked her to teach her how to shoplift .
she thought it would improve her surgical technique .
you must have been close .
april , i really don &apos;t have time for this .
please just-- just ... please .
i want to accept your proposal ...
in private ,
without anybody pressuring me to say &quot; yes . &quot;
and i want to do it in front of god .
actually--actually , no , you know what ? no .
i @-@ i &apos;m not accepting your proposal ,
i am proposing to you .
i want to be your wife .
i think you need to think some stuff out .
i did .
okay .
yes , it was jackson .
and ... yes , i @-@ i have feelings for him .
he &apos;s always gonna be a part of my life .
and that gets confusing sometimes ,
especially when he &apos;s
pulling babies out of burning buses .
but ...
i ... i @-@ i &apos;m not good at this .
i--this is all new to me .
okay , i was never the girl that got picked at the dance .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m not good at it ,
and i &apos;m indecisive
because i see eight sides of everything .
and that &apos;s what you &apos;re picking when you pick me .
and you may not want that .
i thought maybe nobody would ever want that .
april--
but i ... i want you .
i want to marry you .
so will you marry me ?
sofia is downstairs in the day care .
i &apos;m sorry i called you a baby @-@ snatcher .
i was upset ,
and i shouldn &apos;t have spoken to you like that .
you were just trying to cool off ,
and that was the right thing to do--
sofia and i will be staying at mer &apos;s again tonight .
that &apos;ll be two nights with me .
you can take her the following two nights .
and we &apos;ll switch off like that
until we can figure out a real schedule .
well , how long is-- is this gonna be going on ?
i don &apos;t know .
dr. ben warren ,
this is your wife .
sorry ... i keep missing you . it &apos;s--
it &apos;s been ...
something happened with richard--
a health situation .
i got involved in that .
he &apos;s still unconscious .
i don &apos;t know how he &apos;s going to ...
but he &apos;s alive .
heather &apos;s uncle just arrived .
he &apos;s with her mom , and her brother &apos;s on his way .
thank you for staying with her .
go home . get some rest .
you need to tell your guys
to stop going out to the damn pile if they &apos;re injured .
i keep patching up the same damn guys .
i could tell &apos; em , but it &apos;s not gonna make any difference .
they can &apos;t just sit around .
it ... makes them nuts .
all right , try harder !
where &apos;s the rig ?
you okay ? you sure ?
okay . out back .
hey , sir ?

what are you doing ?
we &apos;re his people . we have to go .
uh , actually , no , we don &apos;t . we &apos;re
not trained--
sharpie lady helped .
sharpie lady almost got herself killed .
we have to go .
i don &apos;t know what the deal is with him and heather .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s their weird competition thing .
or maybe they were having secret sex in the bathrooms .
i don &apos;t care . whatever it is ,
shane hasn &apos;t said a single word since she died ,
and we &apos;re what he has . we &apos;re what we have .
maybe we get through this program normal .
or maybe we end up cranky , work @-@ obsessed people
who live on the side of a mountain
and have no family or children ,
and we only have each other
because no one else can stand us .
what is she talking--
get up !
e @-@ everything okay ?
yeah . yeah , uh ,
meredith just wants me to hang out at her house .
zola needs some attention .
and derek is pretty wiped out .
callie and sofia are there , so ...
is there anything i can do ? i mean , i could , uh ...
good night .
yeah .
zola is asleep .
all right , little miss ...
in five minutes , it &apos;s your turn .
to be clear , i am happy to do the dishes ,
but there is no universe in which i generate dinner .
all right , we &apos;ll figure it out .
mac and cheese .
oh , no , we had that last night .
well , and it was good . right ? it was good .
oh , thank you .
i &apos;m sorry to bother everybody .
no , it &apos;s okay .
can i see her for just a minute ?
you saw her this afternoon . you can get her tomorrow night .
i know .
but cou--
you can see her when it &apos;s your night .
i could , uh ... i could just take her on the--
on the front porch for a minute ,
and i &apos;m not gonna take her .
do you have any idea how confusing this is for her ?
yeah , i realize that .
well , you know what ?
she &apos;s supposed to be in bed right now .
how am i supposed to get her to sleep
with you coming and going ?
five minutes .
are you kidding me ?
she shows up here with this act ,
and you &apos;re just gonna take her side ?
callie--
it &apos;s an act .
callie , look at me .
i &apos;m your friend .
five minutes .
come here , sofia .
come here , baby . okay . yeah .
whee ! come on , baby .
we just want to survive the storm .
i missed you so much .
we pray ,
&quot; please , god , just get me to the other side . &quot;
we never imagine what it &apos;ll be like when we get there .
i love you so much .
and i miss you every second .
&apos;cause you &apos;re my girl .
what if when the storm passes , nothing &apos;s left ?
i always said i could handle anything .
i was wrong .
i was wrong about a lot of things .
i think there &apos;s no harm in getting another opinion .
was i or was i not correct ?
why does that make you feel so threatened ?
you know , i &apos;m another opinion , and i have to tip my hat .
dr. bailey called it .
nobody said it wasn &apos;t good to deal with the pancreas ,
but he is still clearly unstable .
he hasn &apos;t regained consciousness--
none of that is unusual .
i would like to bring in another person--
somebody that could tell us
i will make the decision .
you &apos;ve said what you think , and then you said it again .
and i will take that under advisement .
dr. grey--
he picked you to be his girlfriend .
and we &apos;re all very happy about that .
but he picked me to be his family .
and you walked away from that responsibility
the second that--
no one said i would be good at it .
and he knew that . but he picked me anyway .
i &apos;m the family .
meredith .
please , don &apos;t get involved .
