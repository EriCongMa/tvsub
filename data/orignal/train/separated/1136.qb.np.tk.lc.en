i &apos;m not ashamed of who i am , but i used to be ,
and if we have to hide like this all the time ,
i &apos;m gonna start to feel that way again .
the lying , the sneaking around--
i feel like a teenager .
yeah . it &apos;s fun , isn &apos;t it ?
i found this in the basement .
just go . and don &apos;t come back .
welcome home , honey .
wow .
i understand why you &apos;re so fond of mr. fitz .
he takes such a personal interest in his students .
where have you been ?
with caleb .
we camped out .
i figured out what the message means .
it wasn &apos;t b @-@ a @-@ d , it was the number 2 @-@ 1 @-@ 4 .
does that number mean anything to you ?
it could be anything .
we have to figure it out , for both our sakes .
you can stay here for a short time , in the guest room .
thank you .
i did it for hanna , not you .
i can &apos;t do this anymore .
it &apos;s over . i &apos;m out .
we &apos;re trying to help you ,
but you need to start being completely honest with us .
the police are waiting in the living room .
they know you lied to them .
what &apos;s going on in there ?
&quot; spencer hastings now a person of interest ...
in my death .
&apos;a . &apos; &quot;
i feel like whole parts of my brain have shut down .
i used to love algebra , or at least i understood it .
and now it &apos;s a mess .
well , it can get really abstract .
yeah , but that &apos;s what i liked about it .
you know ? x &apos;s , y &apos;s , z &apos;s-- none of it real .
i could deal with that .
you just isolate the x factor .
and now i feel like i &apos;m the x factor .
honey , where were you ?
we stopped along the way at emily &apos;s .
now , don &apos;t worry ,
i was expecting this .
it &apos;s mostly about intimidation ,
so i want you to stay calm .
stay calm about what ?
they served a search warrant .
a search warrant ?
for where ? for what ?
the house , the barn , your room--
my room ?
spencer , don &apos;t interfere .
honey .
make them get out .
i can &apos;t .
you &apos;re a person of interest in a murder investigation .
they &apos;re just doing their job .
in an especially ham @-@ fisted way .
what are they looking for ?
things that connect you to alison ...
and what happened to her .
you mean they just came in
and started going through her things ?
let me call you back , em .
okay , bye .
good morning .
good morning .
hey , uh , listen , your mom called .
she &apos;s gonna be swinging by for coffee ,
see if you guys want a lift to school .
she &apos;s coming for coffee ?
yeah , that &apos;s right .
so the kitchen table exists in another dimension
where that already happened ?
i heard the door slam .
was that mom , or was that somebody else ?
uh , no . no , that was , uh , your mom .
so she was already here this morning .
why does she have to leave and fake coming back ?
because she wasn &apos;t just here this morning ,
she was here last night .
mom was here all night ?
listen , when your brother comes down ,
we &apos;re gonna talk about this .
wait . you snuck mom into your room last night ?
technically , you cannot sneak into your own house .
oh . i &apos;m gonna remember that .
did your dad tell you i called ?
i was just around the corner
so i thought i &apos;d take you to school .
um , we &apos;re busted .
you slept here last night ?
uh , it just sort of happened .
so ...
you guys , you &apos;re-- you &apos;re getting back together ?
we don &apos;t know .
no--we &apos;re trying to figure that out .
you don &apos;t look surprised .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
nothing &apos;s wrong .
we were just talking about
how things might change around here .
i don &apos;t need any more of that .
no , your mom means ...
maybe change back .
we &apos;re thinking about trying something .
you coming back ?
well , i mean , that &apos;s something that we need to discuss as a family .
well , how about dinner ?
mike and i could make you guys dinner .
what do you think ?
sounds good .
yeah , sounds good .
are you going to school ?
okay . later .
what happened ?
the police were at spencer &apos;s house .
they had a search warrant .
well , what are they looking for ?
salt ?
no , thanks .
so , you said the cops were at spencer &apos;s house ?
good morning .
morning .
okay , caleb ,
the second floor is all yours .
i &apos;ll grab a shower .
fried eggs , burned butter--
the kitchen hasn &apos;t smelled like this in a long time .
well , it &apos;s a good smell . i like it .
just don &apos;t let him make you late to school .
i won &apos;t . he can finish this on the way .
see you tonight .
okay .
it &apos;s so pretty , hanna .
when did he give it to you ?
he hasn &apos;t given it to me , not yet . i found it .
and i wasn &apos;t looking for it , but i found it ,
and i took a picture , and then i just put it back .
why an owl ?
it &apos;s symbolic .
of what ?
of our first night
in the tent .
we heard owls .
swooping down to carry off their prey ?
you cannot stop the romance .
owls and tents and s &apos;mores
are all part of that night--
every perfect minute of it .
have you two had another opportunity ?
not since he went in the guest room ,
but we do have plans .
apples and spice ?
yeah , it &apos;s really good for you .
healthy , which is nice .
when did that start to happen ?
yeah ? that &apos;s awesome . are you captain ?
yeah .
nice . me too .
oh , em . don &apos;t worry about it . it &apos;s totally cool .
i mean , the breakup was way messy ,
but sean &apos;s a good guy .
i mean , he should be happy .
everybody should be as happy as i am .
you know , maybe i should
practice my surprise face when he gives it to me .
hey . are you okay ?
yeah , we didn &apos;t think you were coming in today .
i have to be someplace other than my house .
are the cops still there ?
they came and went .
they actually took things ?
not so much .
my mom says they did it just to shake me up .
what &apos;d they take ?
um , things from my jewelry box ,
stuff from my closet , a couple of pairs of shoes--
wait . not the tory burches .
hanna .
no , sneakers .
they wanted my laptop , but my mom said no ,
it wasn &apos;t in the search warrant and they couldn &apos;t have it .
look , you guys should know that there &apos;s a chance
that they might try to pull this on you .
search our rooms ?
my mom says it &apos;s a possibility . i &apos;m so sorry .
no-- it &apos;s not your fault .
yeah . we know who &apos;s responsible for this .
i should have known that that trophy was some kind of trap .
it &apos;s like i can hear &quot; a &quot; laughing in my head .
does &quot; a &quot; sound like jenna ?
it &apos;s my mom .
she wants me to come home .
walk me out , okay ?
sure .
aria , come on .
just a second .
这一秒 爱你 -艾瑞亚
这一秒 爱你 -艾瑞亚
hey , emily , got a second ?
i have to get all the way over to the annex .
can i walk you ?
sure .
i just want to ask you something .
okay .
you &apos;re teammates with paige mccullers , right ?
right .
is she seeing anybody ?
cause i like her , she &apos;s fun ,
but i don &apos;t want anything complicated right now .
i don &apos;t know , sean .
paige isn &apos;t really my friend .
oh . oh , i get it . i shouldn &apos;t be asking you .
you &apos;re hanna &apos;s friend . i &apos;m way out of line .
no , sean , that &apos;s okay .
hanna saw you at the table with paige .
she said you &apos;ve got every right to be happy .
she said that ?
i think she meant it .
as for paige , we swim on the same team ,
but i don &apos;t know her that well .
gotcha . thanks .
so tell me , how long have you known about your father and me ?
you told us this morning .
i guess i just sort of had a feeling something was up .
and are you okay with that ?
yeah , i &apos;m beyond okay .
as long as it &apos;s what you and dad want .
well , this part really isn &apos;t about us .
it &apos;s about you and your brother .
we miss you . i miss you .
and i wish you could come home .
hold that thought .
and by the way , it &apos;s my experience
that you should always check before you press &quot; send . &quot;
i don &apos;t think you meant this for me .
mom . that-- that was a mistake .
i know .
hey , i &apos;m just happy that through all of this
you can still think about boys .
so who is it ?
somebody i know ?
no , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s just somebody .
really ? it doesn &apos;t seem like just somebody .
so , what color are these amazing eyes ?
i think i &apos;m gonna have to start looking in the hallways
to see if i can guess who it is .
don &apos;t .
couple of more slips like that text
and i &apos;ll know all about him .
no more slips . promise .
well , that &apos;s too bad .
i was looking forward to finding out more .
it &apos;s private right now .
okay ?
poof . deleted . all gone .
it &apos;s just everybody &apos;s entitled to privacy .
if you and dad can have secrets , why can &apos;t i ?
god , i &apos;m glad to see you .
you &apos;ve got a cop car across from your house .
where ? i didn &apos;t see it .
detectives .
trust me , i know every stock sedan in town .
they used to rotate in front of my house .
what &apos;s going on ?
the police searched my house .
they took things from my room .
i &apos;m a person of interest .
what do they think you did ?
i think they think that ...
they think that i--
they think you hurt alison ?
that &apos;s crazy .
well , it &apos;s good to hear somebody else say that .
you got any coffee made ?
yeah , always .
paper cups ?
why paper cups ?
you &apos;re going to take coffee
to those cops watching your house .
why am i going to do that ?
so they &apos;ll know you know they &apos;re out there
and you &apos;re not afraid of them .
yeah , but i am kind of afraid .
they don &apos;t know that .
toby ..
the car that you saw
alison get in the night that she was killed--
i never saw the driver . i told you .
i think the driver was ian .
you tell the cops what you think ?
yeah , i told them .
and now i &apos;m the little girl who cried ian .
they think you lied to them .
big deal . people lie to the cops all the time .
it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s a lot of things that
add up to make me look really suspicious .
maybe you should keep away from me .
people cross the street when they see me coming ,
and they think you &apos;re trying to frame your brother @-@ in @-@ law .
who else are we gonna hang out with ?
i , uh , i saw you talking to sean the other day .
yeah . he &apos;s nice .
nice .
he makes me laugh .
i know it might be kind of weird ,
you being friends with hanna and hanna being his ex .
that &apos;s not really the weird part , is it ?
sean asked me about you .
he wanted to know if you were seeing anybody .
what &apos;d you tell him ?
i told him as far as i knew you weren &apos;t .
i think he wanted me to talk him up with you .
and i &apos;m pretty sure he &apos;s gonna ask you out .
he has .
and what &apos;d you say ?
i said yes .
it &apos;s not really a date .
we &apos;re going with a bunch of other people .
no big .
yeah .
you &apos;re nervous about this dinner .
yeah , i guess i am .
well , the important thing is
we &apos;ll get past all the sneaking around ,
which , by the way , we were not that clever ,
because aria knew .
what ? when ?
i don &apos;t know , but she did .
she ends up with all of our secrets .
and now she wants one of her own .
what do you mean ?
some new romance .
i found out about it accidentally ,
and i teased her , which apparently was the wrong thing to do .
who &apos;s the boy ?
i don &apos;t know .
she wants to keep it a secret for now ,
which i completely understand .
is it somebody at school ?
probably .
aren &apos;t you interested in who she &apos;s dating ?
of course i am .
and when she &apos;s ready , she &apos;ll tell us .
what ? what is that look ?
it &apos;s the look of somebody who just had to pick up his daughter
after she &apos;d been questioned by the police .
and you had the same look .
she didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
i &apos;m just saying we need
to be a little bit more diligent about this .
yes , but diligent doesn &apos;t mean grilling her
about every text she sends to a boy .
we have to trust her .
well , it &apos;s not aria i don &apos;t trust .
it &apos;s the rest of the world .
you know what i mean .
i think i do .
just hold onto this stuff for me , okay ?
you didn &apos;t mention ezra &apos;s name in the text , did you ?
no , no . but what if i had ?
i mean , if i had made one wrong detail in that text ,
my mom would have figured it out
and everything would have blown up-- forever .
fresh manicures and tiny keyboards--
a deadly combination .
our first coffee together .
the night that he read his short story .
okay , i &apos;ll give you a catalogue later .
just ... put this stuff in your locker .
don &apos;t worry .
thanks .
hey , stop . listen--
look at this way-- we both made a mistake .
no , i can &apos;t do it tonight .
i know what i said , but it &apos;s different now .
first of all , i don &apos;t think she &apos;s who you say she is .
don &apos;t call her that .
no . i can &apos;t do it tonight .
because i say so .
because i &apos;m living in her house and you keep calling--
it &apos;s gotta stop .
okay , fine . later .
later .
you got it wrong .
we heard what we heard , hanna .
no , you heard what you heard ,
but you got it wrong .
he was talking to another girl ,
and there was a lot of history . you could tell .
what happened to being all happy for hanna ?
where &apos;d all that go ?
hanna , we want you to be happy--
then you shouldn &apos;t tell me this , because it &apos;s not true .
not after we ...
you just-- you heard wrong .
he could have been on the
phone with his foster parents or something ,
or his social worker . you don &apos;t know .
okay , maybe we didn &apos;t hear it right .
hanna , we heard what caleb said ,
and you have to know the truth .
i think he &apos;s with someone else and hasn &apos;t told you .
no , caleb has told me everything ,
and i told him everything .
not everything , but i told him all about me .
and what you &apos;re saying , it &apos;s not him .
it can &apos;t be .
okay , guys , maybe we are being a little bit paranoid .
you know , with all that &apos;s going on ,
we &apos;re looking at things too closely ,
we &apos;re getting these details , but can &apos;t see the big picture .
guys .
caleb &apos;s not picking up .
she &apos;s gonna send him a text .
what the hell is going on ?
either it &apos;s exactly what it looks like ,
which is bad enough , or it &apos;s something worse .
couldn &apos;t it just be two pendants that look alike ?
dream on .
if caleb hurts hanna , he &apos;s a dead man .
not literally . i mean--
i gotta go .
impressive ! sean ackard .
score for paige .
he asked me , and i thought it would be fun .
i thought he was gonna hibernate for the rest of the year ,
but you dragged him out of the cave .
nice work .
passing her information ?
what kind of information ?
what was on the flash drive ?
i couldn &apos;t see , but it could have been anything .
anything ?
anything from hanna &apos;s computer , i guess .
caleb the hacker .
is that who toby heard jenna talking to
when she wrote down the number ?
wait . 2 @-@ 1 @-@ 4 has to do with caleb ?
you know what you &apos;re saying , right ?
that jenna plus caleb equals &quot; a. &quot;
no ! he can &apos;t be doing this .
whatever it is , it can &apos;t be this . and it can &apos;t be her .
hanna , no one wants this to be true .
has he called you back ?
not yet .
and nobody &apos;s seen him in school since this morning .
you don &apos;t know what this would mean if it &apos;s true .
hanna , we do know .
wait . hanna--
wait . spence , don &apos;t .
拜托了 -汉娜
two ...
one ...
four .
money ?
you did this for money ?
she knew i was a hacker . she asked me about her phone .
the phone you couldn &apos;t crack , was that a lie too ?
jenna found out that i did work on emily &apos;s phone .
she offered me cash to make myself available to you and listen .
i thought it was just some
generic bitchiness with all the pretty girls .
why shouldn &apos;t i make a couple of bucks ?
you are such a creep .
wait .
then she started asking questions ,
questions that i didn &apos;t like .
and by then ...
other things were happening ... with you and me .
you were spying on me the whole time .
no , not the whole time .
you gave her your locker combination !
that &apos;s how she gave me the flash drive .
what was on it when she got it back ?
junk .
she thinks it &apos;s the log off your cell phone , but it &apos;s not .
no--
don &apos;t touch me .
poor hanna .
i &apos;m sorry .
why ? you didn &apos;t do anything .
i &apos;m part of what happened to her--
what &apos;s happening to all of you .
it &apos;s the other way around , toby .
we happened to you .
what &apos;s it like to run away ?
cold .
didn &apos;t you ever run away ?
once . i think i was seven .
my sister and i had an argument over something ,
and my parents took melissa &apos;s side .
what were you fighting about ?
some great injustice i can &apos;t remember now .
but they sided with her ,
so i made a tuna salad sandwich ,
and i ran away .
and where did you go ?
the movies .
it was something animated .
there was a princess , and everybody was singing .
then i got lonely .
and i ate my tuna salad sandwich
and i came home .
were your parents worried ?
they hadn &apos;t even noticed i was gone .
do me a favor .
what ?
if you ever get the urge to run away again ...
call me first , okay ?
okay .
byron ...
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m not doing anything .
if she finds out you &apos;re spying on her ,
she &apos;ll be furious .
i &apos;m not spying .
i &apos;m just standing in our daughter &apos;s bedroom .
we agreed long ago that we weren &apos;t gonna be
those parents that poke and pry .
yeah , but what about those parents who worry ?
and what if something happened to her ? how would you feel ?
that &apos;s not fair .
life isn &apos;t fair .
if she &apos;s keeping secrets ,
it &apos;s because she learned it from us .
meaning what ?
meaning exactly what i said .
if there are parts of her life that she wants private ,
it &apos;s because we taught her to do that .
you mean i did .
i don &apos;t want to talk about that .
yeah , but it &apos;s still there , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah . it is .
i thought we were past that .
we &apos;re not past it .
we &apos;re trying to find a way around it ,
but we really haven &apos;t dealt with it .
okay , fine . can we just
keep this about aria and this unknown boy ?
can we do that ?
i don &apos;t know , can we ?
is that really what this argument is all about ?
i &apos;m not arguing .
byron , you can &apos;t even agree with me
that we are fighting .
we &apos;re n--
hey , mike .
did you just get home ?
i called her . she didn &apos;t pick up .
did she talk to you ?
radio silence .
poor hanna .
why do you think jenna told caleb to go after her ?
because she was the one who wasn &apos;t seeing anybody .
target of convenience .
i should just pick a boy , someone nice ,
and just tell my mom that that &apos;s who i was texting .
that &apos;d be the simple solution .
there &apos;s nothing simple about lying .
i didn &apos;t mean it like that . i meant lying in general .
okay . if you say so .
you &apos;ve got a good shot at having the search warrant thrown out .
judge enwright is a notorious rubber stamp ,
and he probably didn &apos;t even read it .
so whatever they find , we can get tossed out .
why are they searching my room ?
what makes me so special ?
police thinking is like water .
it runs downhill and travels the path of least resistence .
so when they found out that you and ian were once involved ,
you went to the top of their list .
i could never hurt alison .
she made me furious sometimes , but ...
but i would never hurt her .
honey , i know you didn &apos;t do what they think you did .
you couldn &apos;t . we &apos;re gonna get this behind us ,
and then we &apos;re gonna figure out a way to move ahead--
all of us , as a family .
come downstairs ?
in a little while .
where were you all morning ?
walking .
just walking .
so it &apos;s true ?
yeah . it &apos;s all true .
where &apos;s spencer ?
oh , she stayed home .
come on .
hanna .
i just want to talk to her .
hello ?
yes ?
this is hanna .
in case you couldn &apos;t guess .
what did you do to mom and dad ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
they were getting along , and i came home
and find them fighting in your room .
about what ?
about some boy they don &apos;t like .
dump him . or just say you &apos;ll dump him .
it &apos;s not that simple .
lie to them , okay ?
you used to do it all the time .
tell them what they want to know ,
even if you have to make it up .
hey , it &apos;s gonna be okay , all right ?
we &apos;re gonna go downstairs , we &apos;re gonna have dinner ,
we &apos;re gonna talk about mom coming back ,
and everything &apos;s gonna go back to normal .
okay ?
it better .
change of plans .
your mom has called . she &apos;s , uh , not feeling well .
is she sick ?
no , she &apos;s just not up to it tonight .
we &apos;ll do it another time . soon .
come on . everything smells so great .
i can &apos;t wait to see what you guys came up with .
you know , they were worried about you .
they thought you might have run away .
thank you for your concern .
i think i &apos;d understand if you did , though .
you know , run away .
you know what i don &apos;t need , ian ?
i don &apos;t need your understanding .
well , we &apos;re family . we should act like one .
family protects itself .
i thought you had to protect melissa
and your bundle of joy .
i do .
and i will .
but right now there &apos;s still
a window of protection left open for you .
we just need to be honest with each other .
you want to help me run away , don &apos;t you ?
oh , that would be great for you .
&quot; she ran away , she must be guilty . &quot;
if i disappeared , that would
just clean up everything for you , wouldn &apos;t it ?
time &apos;s running out for you , spencer .
you should take the help that &apos;s offered-- wherever it comes from .
because when they arrest you ...
it &apos;ll be too late .
nice room .
thanks .
window seat . i always wanted a room with one of those .
you had your date with sean ?
yeah .
that &apos;s where i was tonight .
how &apos;d it go ?
great .
good . he &apos;s a nice guy .
yeah , it went okay .
good .
yeah .
until he kissed me .
he took me home and kissed me goodnight .
and ...
i don &apos;t know ,
the date , the whole night , just felt
phony all of a sudden ,
like it wasn &apos;t me--
it was somebody i was watching , but not me .
he went home , and i texted you .
sean &apos;s a nice guy ,
and if he &apos;s interested in you as more than a friend ,
you have to be honest with him .
you &apos;re saying i should dump him ?
i &apos;m saying you shouldn &apos;t lead him on ,
you have to be honest .
that is so easy for you to say .
you &apos;re fearless .
i am so not fearless .
you came out .
i didn &apos;t come out of the closet .
i fell out-- on my face .
but i &apos;m out .
and whatever else happens ,
i don &apos;t have to worry about it anymore .
if i say it out loud ...
if i say ...
&quot; i &apos;m gay ... &quot;
the whole world is gonna change .
yeah . it will .
you want to hear something funny ?
i would love to hear something funny .
when i was trying to talk myself into being interested in boys ,
i would look for guys like you .
like me how ?
the kind that would pull me up on stage and get me to sing .
because i would never do that on my own .
hanna ?
yeah ?
caleb &apos;s things are gone from the guest room .
he left .
can i come in ?
not right now ,
i &apos;m gonna take a bath .
i &apos;m sorry , honey . it &apos;s me .
did you just get home ?
yeah .
is everything okay ?
i was right .
we &apos;ve got a shot at having the search warrant thrown out .
that &apos;s good .
yeah , that &apos;s good ,
but there was nothing for them to find .
they did find something .
what do you mean ?
i got this back channel .
they found some fibers ,
some threads caught in a bracelet .
that name bracelet of yours .
the one alison gave us ?
the threads match the sweater
that they found in toby &apos;s closet ,
the one with the blood stains .
i have to ask you-- did you have that sweater ?
did you plant it in toby &apos;s house ?
no !
that &apos;s the sweater alison was wearing the night she died .
how could i have that sweater ?
i guess the theory is that she gave it to you that night ,
or you took it from her .
i took it from her ?
you mean like after she--
inside their minds , it makes sense .
what about in your mind ? what do you think ?
i think someone &apos;s going to a
great deal of trouble to make you look guilty .
mom .
it &apos;s okay .
