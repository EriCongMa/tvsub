this is really hard because i still love you .
if you &apos;re ever not feeling this ,
then just be honest with me .
&apos;cause i &apos;d rather be hurt than surprised .
i &apos;m not really sure i &apos;m into guys .
i mean , i &apos;ve never even kissed a girl , so how would i know ?
arbiter is responsible for the death of jack .
and i &apos;ve just learned that justina marks works for arbiter .
do you realize what you &apos;ve just done ?
i don &apos;t care .
you will .
is it true you made these false allegations
because she found out you were having sex
with your foster brother ?
we &apos;re gonna fight this .
i can &apos;t sue her .
we absolutely can .
we can &apos;t because it &apos;s true .
oh , my god .
please tell me that i am misunderstanding this , callie .
when did this happen ?
idyllwild .
it was only once . i thought i couldn &apos;t get adopted .
why would you ...
honey , honey , just ...
i know that there were complications , callie ,
but why wouldn &apos;t you think you were getting adopted ?
um , remember when rita was accused of hitting carmen ?
well , i got her to admit that she was lying
and i recorded it .
when i told her i wasn &apos;t going to let her get away with it ,
she told me that if i ruined her life that she would ruin mine .
okay , so wait , what does this have to do
with you getting adopted ?
carmen knew that i was seeing brandon
while i was at gu .
wait , after the restraining order ?
so when i thought that rita was going to lose her license
and her career and everything ,
i sent her the recording of what carmen had said ,
我需要和你谈谈
and i figured that
that meant carmen was going to blow up my adoption
by telling my social workers everything brandon and i had done ,
and i figured if for whatever reason she didn &apos;t ,
that for sure ...
rita would .
wait a minute , rita knew ?
don &apos;t get mad at rita . she thought everything was over .
yeah , like we did .
she just wanted me to have a family .
so what are the different types of potential energy ?
mat ?
um , there &apos;s chemical , gravitational , mechanical ,
and , um ...
there &apos;s one more .
nuclear .
nice of you to join us , mr. stratos .
and what &apos;s an everyday example of potential energy at work ?
i &apos;ll give you a hint ... it was covered in the chapter .
anyone know the answer ?
is it true jude kissed you ?
who said that ?
well , i mean , he did it at your locker ,
so , like , everyone saw it .
so what if he did ?
isn &apos;t he gay ?
it really isn &apos;t any of your business , daria .
what about connor ?
what about connor ?
he lives in la .
are you okay ?
no , i &apos;m not . i &apos;m very much not okay .
yeah , well , i got that .
is there anything i can do ?
are you back together with lexi ?
no . i mean , we talked about it , but , you know ...
good .
you want to have sex ?
mariana ?
hey , uh , is nick okay ?
is he here ? i texted him , but he hasn &apos;t answered me .
well , he was late during first period and he seemed kind of off .
like , really off .
i gotta run .
don &apos;t ... don &apos;t do that .
all right , i &apos;m sorry , man .
i &apos;m just messing with you , jeez .
yeah .
i ... i think mariana is looking for you .
oh , yeah ? yeah , i &apos;m looking for her too .
uh , hey , are you ... are you sick or something ?
no , why ?
just checking .
you &apos;re a good friend .
oh , yeah ? thanks , man .
how would you like to do your good friend a little favor ?
why didn &apos;t you tell us ?
i didn &apos;t want to destroy the family .
as soon as we found out that i could get adopted ,
we stopped everything right away .
we haven &apos;t done anything since .
we are family now .
that &apos;s the only reason you let us go through with it ?
because you didn &apos;t want to destroy the family , callie ?
no . no , of course not .
i love you both and i want you to be my moms .
i can &apos;t believe this was going on
all this time right under our noses .
how did we not know this was happening ?
stef .
it &apos;s not the time . it &apos;s not the time .
we love you too , callie .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s just a lot to wrap our heads around .
if we had told you , what would you have done ?
hey , you got a sec ?
mike , what are you doing here ?
is nick stratos in school today ?
uh ... i don &apos;t ...
let me check .
why ? is everything okay ?
uh , there was a fire at his dad &apos;s warehouse .
what ?
he &apos;s not in class .
what happened ?
looks like arson .
are you okay ? you don &apos;t look so good .
are you feeling okay ?
look , um , i &apos;m so , so sorry
that you saw mat and me in the garage .
i know what you &apos;re thinking ,
but i swear , that &apos;s not what &apos;s going on .
i &apos;m gonna tell you everything , okay ?
everything .
okay .
mat wrote me a note
telling me that he still loved me .
at least , that &apos;s what he says . i never got it .
i think zoey must have
taken it out of my bag at rehearsal or something .
anyway , he told me about it
and he asked me to get back together with him .
but ... i told him no .
no , i did .
because i &apos;m with you now and i really like you .
and what you saw in the garage ,
that was just us saying goodbye . i swear .
that &apos;s not what it looked like .
i know .
but that &apos;s the truth . honest to god .
yeah , sure . sure it is . you know what ?
you &apos;re just telling me all this
because you guys want to use the warehouse for your show .
no , that &apos;s not ... i don &apos;t even care about the stupid show .
you said ... you said you weren &apos;t going to surprise me .
i know . i know , and i &apos;m sorry . but that &apos;s not ...
hey , shouldn &apos;t you two be in class ?
oh , um ... i &apos;m sorry . we were just ...
yeah , i can see that . let &apos;s go .
can &apos;t we just have ...
no .
let &apos;s go now .
okay , wait , so you think nick did it ?
well , we &apos;d like to talk to him about it .
wait .
yes ? okay . no , i &apos;ll be right there .
apparently , mr. stratos is here ,
demanding to speak to us .
mr. stratos ? want to come on in ?
mike was just telling us about your warehouse .
that &apos;s awful . i &apos;m so sorry .
oh , you &apos;re gonna be when i sue you .
uh , why ... why would you sue us ?
i never gave permission for the school to use it
to put on that play . so you &apos;re liable .
yes , you did . we spoke on the phone .
i spoke with someone on the phone . nick connected us .
wasn &apos;t me , &apos; cause i didn &apos;t speak with anyone .
now get nick in here . i want to talk to him .
he &apos;s not here . he didn &apos;t come to school today .
then what &apos;s his car doing here ? it &apos;s right out front .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing , love . what do you need ?
i wanted to talk to mama .
about what ?
i saw nick and he was ...
you saw nick ?
here at school ?
he seemed really weird .
okay , come with me .
callie , would you go back to class ? we &apos;ll talk later .
看 &quot; 寄养发现 &quot; 了吗 很多人在说你和布兰登的坏话
well , i just saw nick and he seemed super weird .
so i take it you &apos;re the girl ...
the one who &apos;s been messing with my son .
mariana , this is nick &apos;s father ,
mr. stratos .
oh , hi .
what do you mean , &quot; super weird &quot; ?
um , well , he was just ...
it &apos;s important you tell us everything that happened .
okay . well , nick was upset
because he thought that mat and i were getting back together .
we &apos;re not , but he didn &apos;t want to believe me .
oh , come on .
you have been playing my son and he finally figured it out .
okay ... okay .
of course he &apos;s upset .
no , it ... it was more than that .
he ... he seemed off .
off in what way , mariana ?
i don &apos;t know , why ?
what happened ? did nick do something ?
n @-@ not that we know of , but there was a fire at the warehouse ...
and we just ... we don &apos;t ...
you think nick did it ?
hey , i just confirmed , he &apos;s not in class and no one &apos;s seen him .
then where the hell is he ?
i swear to god , you people are incompetent .
why don &apos;t we go and see if nick &apos;s car is here , shall we ?
his car was right there !
so the kids just come and go as they please ?
mariana , why don &apos;t you go back to class , okay ?
uh , mr. stratos , d @-@ do you think ...
do you think that nick would , uh , hurt himself or anyone else ?
what are you asking me ?
does he have access to any weapons ?
weapons ?
do you keep a gun in the house ?
i have a gun .
yes . i have a carry permit .
but i keep it locked in the car .
okay , do you think that we could check it
and make sure that it &apos;s still there ?
we don &apos;t need to .
humor me .
there &apos;s no point in ...
so let &apos;s give nick a call again , find out where he is .
get down ... everybody down . stop the car now !
turn off the engine !
come out with your hands in the air !
whoa ! this is a little bit over the top for cutting a class .
okay . what are you doing in nick &apos;s car ?
i ... i just borrowed it so i could take emma out .
in the middle of the school day ? nice , jesus !
so nick is here ? nick &apos;s on campus ?
look , it &apos;s not his fault .
i &apos;m the one who asked him to borrow the car .
nick &apos;s got a gun . as far as we know , he is here .
yeah .
we &apos;ve got to lockdown this school now .
let &apos;s get everyone in the office .

i repeat ...
you two get into a classroom , right now !

i repeat , this is not a drill .
this is a code blue . code blue .
code blue , this is a code blue . this is not a drill .
i repeat , this is not a drill .
what does &quot; code blue &quot; mean ?
it means someone has a gun on campus .
maybe if i &apos;m lucky , i &apos;ll get shot
so i don &apos;t have to see moms .
brandon , what a stupid thing to say .
code blue , this is a code blue .
are you okay ?
yeah . yeah ... i @-@ i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m just a sub , so i &apos;ve never been through anything like this .

everyone , we have to stay quiet and do what i say .
i need this table in front of this door right now .
stack the stools on the table .

wait , we don &apos;t open the door for anyone .
let me in , please .
it &apos;s mariana ... mariana foster .
mariana . we have to let her in .

excuse me , i got one of those calls ...
a robocall saying the school is going on lockdown ?
yes , that &apos;s right .
what is going on ?
um , listen , there is no need to panic ,
but we have reason to believe that there might be someone
on campus with a gun .
wait , wait . wait , excuse me . i want to take my son home now .
i understand , but that &apos;s not possible .
the best thing for you and for your son
is for you to go to the designated meeting area and wait there .
i am not leaving here without my son .
listen , i know this is scary .
it &apos;s scary .
it is . my kids are in there too .
we have a job to do and
it is not safe for you to be here right now .
officer johnston , please .
he &apos;s going to escort you to the meeting area .
and please wait .
but we have to ...
it &apos;s going to be fine .
talk to our kids and ...
it &apos;s going to be fine , i promise you .
thank you for your cooperation .
it will be fine .
this is ridiculous .
everything is going to be okay .
all right ? i promise you .
you &apos;re good . i got you .
you &apos;re okay .
i &apos;m going to be right back , okay ?
okay . good girl .
why are they asking about nick ?
the warehouse burned down .
what ?
with all the sets and everything .
i heard when i was in the office .
i &apos;m really sorry .
maybe they think nick &apos;s , like , lost it or something .
i never found mariana . i assume she got back to her class .
are all the kids accounted for ?
uh , not yet .
but we haven &apos;t gotten roll call back from all the classes yet .
we have emma and jesus here , of course .
and jude is in his class .
but we still haven &apos;t heard anything back
about mariana , callie , or brandon .
what is taking so long ?
well , we have a sub in one class ,
so it might just take a little longer .
don &apos;t worry .
what ? what ?
sorry . sorry , i just ...
this is what happens when i get nervous .
emma , come on . &apos; kay ? take a deep breath .
it &apos;s okay . we &apos;re going to be fine .
i just can &apos;t believe this is all because of nick .
did he seem upset
when you saw him this morning ?
yeah .
yeah , i guess he was kind of acting strange .
he thanked me for being a good friend .
well , you are a good friend .
but it wasn &apos;t like that .
the way he was talking ,
it was more heavy .
like he was going away for a long time .
or like ...
like he was going to do something to himself ?
hey , buddy , it &apos;s your dad . please call me .
don &apos;t do anything stupid .
please .
we should get roll done .
here .
miranda collins ?
abby wheeler ?
dean kudrow ?
leo james ?
matthew johnson ?
stephen evans ?
你在吗
hey , turn that off .
you &apos;re gonna get us killed .
what are you doing ?
whenever i get scared or whatever ,
i do the sign of the cross on my hand .
it makes me feel better ,
like i &apos;m talking to god , or ...
i know , it &apos;s dumb .
no . i don &apos;t think so .
just like that .
so ... you and robby ?
yeah , me and robby .
we &apos;re talking about the same guy here , right ?
wrestling robby , not ...
yeah , him .
with the ... the hairy arms ?
yeah .
ugh , they were so hairy .
when he would put his arms around me , he would tickle my ears .
how long were you guys together ?
couple months .
i think you &apos;re better off anyway .
i didn &apos;t see you guys together .
apparently , he didn &apos;t either .
yeah , well , you deserve a lot more
than some knucklehead who cheats on you .
okay , we got the last roll from the sub &apos;s room .
and it looks like brandon and callie are in there .
wait , i thought the sub was doing junior high ?
yeah , they must &apos;ve gotten pulled in during the lockdown .
thank god . looks like they &apos;re the ones
taking the roll and sending the emails .
let me see .
okay .
凯丽 布兰登 你们还好吧
发生什么事情了 一切都还好吗

i &apos;m gonna go find her . let me go .
listen to me , i know you &apos;re scared .
get off of me !
i know you &apos;re scared . but nobody &apos;s going out there
to be target practice for somebody with a gun .
i know it &apos;s not what you want to hear right now ,
but you are not leaving this room .
maybe she &apos;s hiding out somewhere .
unless she &apos;s with nick ?
stef , we have all of the kids
except mariana .
move that perimeter back !
what the hell is taking so long ?
i mean , seriously , why aren &apos;t they telling us anything ?
quiet .
you know what ?
we &apos;re all just ... we &apos;re just sitting ducks .
shut up . okay ? you &apos;re scaring them .
you guys ? there &apos;s something wrong with stasia .
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
