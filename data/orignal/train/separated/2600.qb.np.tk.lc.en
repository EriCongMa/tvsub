i am not here to hurt you , liz .
i &apos;m one of the good guys .
reddington -- he is not who you think he is .
i need to tell lizzy .
i can &apos;t let you do that .
she deserves the truth .
i don &apos;t understand , ray .
i thought we had an arrangement .
the people i represent , they &apos;re ...
they &apos;re nervous .
the key in the lamp -- i know you found it .
take it to radford bank , box number 3929 .
goodbye , liz .
you are headed to stepanska , yes ?
you speak english .
i am english , sir . i hope you don &apos;t mind .
um , i read somewhere that you also speak the language .
makes life a little easier for me .
of course .
not a lot of englishmen driving in prague .
little hot in here , hmm ?
you mind turning on the air ?
yes , sir .
and there &apos;s some bottled water back there , if you &apos;d like .
oh , yeah .
mr. emil dusek , a member of parliament here in prague ,
埃米尔 · 杜谢克因涉嫌谋杀男妓被捕
has been arrested .
our sources tell us that mr. dusek is a suspect
in an ongoing murder investigation .
he was found in a young man &apos;s apartment .
that man was a known male escort
who police believe was strangled to death .
let me be clear .
i am completely innocent of these charges
and look forward to an opportunity to clear my name .
however , i have chosen to withdraw from the senate
to concentrate on my defense .
no more questions .
niko ! my goodness !
red ! welcome !
the house is yours until i return .
my flight is in three hours .
look at you . you &apos;re wasting away .
down 37 pounds .
all from swimming ?
yes -- swimming .
and bread . i cut out bread entirely .
i was a lifeguard my junior year in high school .
had to give mouth @-@ to @-@ mouth to mrs. beerman .
she belched up a lung full of corned beef and chlorine .
i haven &apos;t been in a pool since .
i &apos;m sorry -- weren &apos;t you in the navy ?
enough . to business .
what happened in prague -- losing emil dusek --
is very concerning .
what happened in prague is unfortunate ,
but how it happened is of more concern .
i believe it &apos;s a frame .
dusek was targeted .
targeted by whom ?
the kingmaker .
you &apos;re saying he was retained to eliminate dusek
as a way of weakening our interests ?
yes .
what i don &apos;t know is who retained him .
you do know .
you may not have a name , but , red ,
this was done by the same mysterious enemy
who has been plaguing you for months .
prague is just one example .
someone has devoted a great deal of time and energy
to depreciate your business .
watch your tone .
it &apos;s not my tone , red .
people are talking .
your friends are talking -- whispering .
i don &apos;t have any friends .
whoever this unseen enemy is ,
they don &apos;t think he &apos;s after us .
they think he &apos;s after you .
for now , they remain loyal , but they won &apos;t forever .
these &quot; friends &quot; you mention ,
the ones whispering in the shadows --
tell them from me --
&quot; shut the hell up . &quot;
st. adrian &apos;s hospital ?
this is where your father died .
sam .
it &apos;s the same building . i checked like four times .
where did you get this ?
at least tell me this -- do you trust the source ?
no .
doesn &apos;t prove reddington was there the day sam died .
if reddington did fly all the way to nebraska
just to talk to my dad before he died ,
there must have been something he wanted .
well , is it possible they were friends ,
he was just paying his respects ?
since when does reddington have friends ?
you gonna ask him about it ?
not until i know whether the photo &apos;s real .
jamie , tell your people i &apos;ll have an answer
by the end of the week ,
but whether or not we do business ,
i &apos;m keeping all the samples .
lizzy . perfect timing . say hello to jamie .
hello .
where &apos;s tom ?
what a delightful man --
scrupulous mind for business , sharp as a tack .
red , where is tom ?
he &apos;s in new york .
not to worry . my people are watching .
please excuse the house .
my host spends a tremendous amount of money
on all the wrong things .
what the hell is that ?
cannabis .
jamie &apos;s trying to form a huge consortium of farms
and warehouses outside denver
and having a little trouble securing the financing ,
so i would be the bank .
i &apos;d offer you an edible , but we have work to do .
the kingmaker .
i &apos;ve never met the man ,
but i recently lost a great deal of time and money
to his ... talents .
he &apos;s single @-@ handedly responsible for the rise and fall
of some of the world &apos;s most pivotal politicians and statesmen .
he &apos;s , what , some kind of political strategist ?
he &apos;s raised opposition research to an art form .
he arranges scandals , exploits proclivities ,
assassinates when necessary .
i don &apos;t know how he chooses his clients ,
but they say he grooms them from an early age --
the right universities ,
mentors , even spouses .
and when they &apos;re ready to run ,
he does whatever it takes to assure their victory .
he &apos;s causing trouble for some politician in your pocket ,
and now you want the fbi to arrest him ?
yes . please .
and thank you .
my sources say he left prague within the last 12 hours
on a flight to the united states .
the average hotel @-@ room bed can be riddled with anywhere
between 100,000 and 2 million dust mites , bedbugs ...
fecal matter , urine , semen ,
methicillin @-@ resistant staphylococcus aureus .
that bacteria alone
kills more than 15,000 americans per year .
i will not be joining them .
these cases -- you often ask for something in return .
now i &apos;m asking .
tom --
i want to know his every move .
the kingmaker is on his way , lizzy ,
and whatever he intends to touch will turn very nasty .
almost 10 years ago now ,
i promised you such a day would come .
it will be the first of many on this grand journey of yours .
so , how far down is that ?
25 feet .
it has to be convincing .
well , it &apos;s gonna be really convincing if we end up dead .
like all objects ,
a vehicle in free fall will accelerate
at a rate of 9.8 meters per second , squared .
at 6,180 pounds , your car will generate
an impact force of 557.2 kilonewtons --
well below the nhtsa thresholds for a front @-@ end collision .
how will it happen ?
the less you know , the better .
the life you &apos;ve requested is a bold one , patrick --
full of bold choices , like this one .
it would be a shame to learn ,
after all this time , that you never really had it in you .
if you wish to remain my client ,
you will be on this bridge at exactly 4 : 00 p.m.
if you do not , then i wish you and yours
the loveliest of ordinary lives .
i &apos;ll be here .
yes .
you won &apos;t be for long .
reddington &apos;s intel had our suspect travel from prague
to the united states sometime in the past 12 hours .
there were six flights during this time period .
we &apos;ve pulled the passenger manifests
and applied the profile you developed --
a foreign national , male , 35 to 65 years of age ,
traveling alone in first class .
that narrowed the list down to 47 passengers .
of those , 40 were on business .
we were able to confirm their identities and itineraries
with their respective corporations ,
which leaves seven potentials .
six of which checked in to the hotels they had listed
on their immigration forms .
one did not .
you &apos;re looking at the kingmaker .
paul fredrick smithson .
got to assume that &apos;s an alias .
where did they land ?
jfk 4 : 52 p.m.
and get this --
we pulled the credit card that our suspect used
to purchase his plane ticket into the united states .
45 minutes ago , that card was used
to book a hotel room in manhattan .
what hotel ?
the st. rose in midtown .
federal agents ! hands where i can see them .
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s a case of stolen identity .
he cloned his credit card and passport ,
and he &apos;s a salesman who travels frequently .
for all we know , this guy &apos;s not even in new york anymore .
this could have just been his entry point .
have you lost your mind ?
what i &apos;ve lost is the luxury of time , alan .
i don &apos;t have a week to wait around
for your minions to pass my request up the food chain .
this is out @-@ of @-@ bounds , ray .
as much as i appreciate a good sports matephor ,
what i &apos;ve come to discuss requires
a somewhat more dramatic analogy .
i &apos;m under attack and have been for some time --
my interests , my allies .
someone has targeted my key infrastructure ,
and the truth is , i &apos;m bleeding .
why should i even consider involving myself in your mess ?
because my enemy is your enemy .
we co @-@ exist , ray .
surely our last interaction proved that we &apos;re not friends .
don &apos;t overestimate the nature of our relationship .
by my estimation , we not only co @-@ exist --
we depend on each other to survive .
what i possess would lay waste to you and your alliance .
yes , and should that information ever become public ,
there would be no reason for us not to kill you on the spot .
i have no intention of making it public .
but this enemy of mine , if he prevails --
and , in so doing ,
finds himself in possession of that information --
he may very well choose not to be so ... discreet .
you &apos;re already involved in this mess , alan ,
and if i lose control of the information ,
you may be exposed .
and if i die , it triggers my own protocol for release .
i don &apos;t respond well to threats .
i &apos;m not here to threaten you .
i &apos;m here to see if we can work together .
so , how is everything , guys ?
good .
yeah ?
delicious .
all right .
hey , i &apos;m so glad you took the day .
you &apos;ve been working so hard .
come here .
love you .
i love you .
where you going ?
it &apos;s faster going through lancaster .
yeah , yeah , i @-@ i thought we &apos;d , uh ,
take the bridge , drive along the river .
you know , maybe we get out , maddy can feed the ducks .
sounds great .
he &apos;s coming your way .
yes .
once again , you are looking at cellphone footage
taken by a pedestrian near the causeway bridge .
patrick chandler , a state assemblyman ,
was involved in a collision
that forced his car over the side rail --
a terrifying hit @-@ and @-@ run .
the assemblyman and his family
were taken to a nearby hospital ,
where doctors were unable to resuscitate mrs. chandler .
this is a tragic loss for the new york state lawmaker .
keep it right here on this news channel for all the late @-@ brea--
you think he did this ?
some freshman politician
is suddenly thrust into the spotlight ,
his selfless heroism on full display .
i suspect assemblyman patrick chandler &apos;s poll numbers
are about to go through the roof .
it just reeks of the kingmaker .
i just watched a man give cpr to his dying wife ,
and you &apos;re telling me it was a media stunt ?
yes .
go out to the bridge .
perhaps you can figure out why there aren &apos;t any tire marks .
it just doesn &apos;t make any sense . chandler &apos;s a boy scout ,
president of the high school student council ,
chairman of the young entrepreneurs society at princeton .
he also did a term in the county legislature
before becoming the youngest assemblyman
in all of new york &apos;s 150 districts .
this guy &apos;s been groomed .
he was just elected 10 months ago .
his term is two years .
wait . so he &apos;s not even running for anything ?
so , what are we saying -- he risked his child &apos;s life
and murdered his wife ... for what ?
well , he also risked his own life .
listen to this .
&quot; allison is my everything , my moral center .
she makes me a better man . &quot;
sorry . husbands lie to their wives .
i have no problem believing
this guy is capable of just about anything .
all right , so , wind this up
and get over to that accident site .
agent keen .
i got that surveillance footage you subpoenaed .
what exactly are we looking for ?
reddington .
whoa . hold on .
mr. reddington .
bingo .
4 : 37 in the afternoon .
my father died at 5 : 30 .
red left one hour before .
hey , keen , you ready ?
okay , so , what &apos;s the deal ?
chandler drove up from the south .
no . no , not with the case .
something &apos;s wrong ,
and it &apos;s not just reddington being at that hospital .
you and tom having problems ?
look , you &apos;re not the first one to deal with this .
you know , people wake up and realize
their husband or wife isn &apos;t everything they hoped for .
we had a fight .
he left the house .
i don &apos;t even know where he went .
he &apos;ll be back .
it &apos;s not over . you know that .
so ... why from the south ?
why was chandler even on this bridge at all ?
his house and his office are both in werther county ,
which is the opposite direction .
he planned to be here .
and red was right .
the accident @-@ investigation squad didn &apos;t find any skid marks
leading up to the drop @-@ off point .
chandler didn &apos;t even try to stop .
eh , he &apos;ll say he didn &apos;t have time .
or maybe the plan was to go over the side .
what about the other vehicle that hit him ?
the driver loses control and never slams on the brakes ?
nah , he needed speed
enough to drive chandler &apos;s car through that railing .
as crazy as it seems , it did work .
i mean , this chandler guy is everywhere --
every news show , talk show .
let &apos;s go pay new york &apos;s newest hero a visit .
look , i need to get back to the hospital .
my daughter &apos;s still there .
i &apos;ve already spoken with the patrol guys .
we know you spoke to patrol ,
but we &apos;re not with the nypd . we &apos;re with the fbi .
the fbi ? i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
well , actually , we were hoping
you could help us understand a few things .
like why you and your family
were crossing the causeway bridge from the south .
you don &apos;t live in that direction . where were you headed ?
nowhere . um , we just stopped to get some ice cream ,
then decided to take a drive .
it was your idea ?
yes . uh , actually , no .
uh ... look , i &apos;m not sure .
it might have been my daughter &apos;s .
it must be difficult to see her so traumatized .
she &apos;s heartbroken .
her mother was everything to her .
she was everything to us both .
i &apos;m sorry for your family &apos;s loss .
we understand your wife suffered a concussion .
that &apos;s how she drowned ?
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m really ready to talk about all this .
we &apos;re just looking for the facts .
i understand that ,
but we &apos;re gonna have to do this some other time .
right now i need to be with my daughter .
hey , hold on .
text me the address .
we got something .
the 911 calls all give the same i.d.
for the vehicle that hit chandler .
let me guess -- a van .
a utility van with signage for a destination plumbing .
it &apos;s a one @-@ man shop owned by an arturo ruiz .
it seems we have a problem .
yeah . you &apos;re damn right we do .
you were supposed to stay .
you were supposed to give the police a statement
that it was an accident .
it doesn &apos;t look like an accident , arturo ,
if you flee the scene .
you kidding me right now ?
there were witnesses on that bridge .
do you really think the police aren &apos;t going to find you ?
it &apos;s only a matter of time before they &apos;re standing here
treating you like a suspect ,
not like a man who lost control of his vehicle .
i have to say ...
i &apos;m really quite upset .
you lied to me . you told me he &apos;d be alone .
you didn &apos;t say that a woman and a child would be in the car .
what difference does that make ?
that woman died .
i &apos;m the one who has to live with this .
no , arturo .
you don &apos;t .
all right , everyone .
first , my thanks for making time on such short notice .
we have serious business to discuss .
your message said you were approached by reddington .
you would think he &apos;d be less interested in talking
after your last ... conversation .
i agree .
so if he &apos;s making contact ,
it &apos;s only because he thinks it &apos;s absolutely necessary .
what does he want ?
our assistance .
his business is under attack .
someone -- someone with skill and resources
is conducting a highly advanced ,
globally coordinated assault on his interests .
they don &apos;t seem satisfied to just kill him .
this enemy of his seems to want him to lose everything .
i like the sound of that .
don &apos;t be so sure .
if reddington has nothing to lose ,
then there &apos;s no reason
for him to hold this evidence he has against us at bay .
and if he dies ...
this enemy -- what do we know about him ?
and more importantly , what does he know about us ?
we know very little about him , but that &apos;s not surprising ,
because reddington himself doesn &apos;t know .
as for what this enemy knows about us ,
so far , we believe nothing .
but if we want to keep it that way ,
we may have to get involved .
for this enemy to elude reddington , despite reddington &apos;s skill ,
i believe it may be an error to make such a dangerous man our enemy .
and if he exposes us ?
if that possibility becomes real ,
we will have to respond as we have in the past --
to protect our alliance .
with all due respect ,
since you don &apos;t speak for all of us ,
we should put it to a vote and then see where we stand .
hello ? mr. ruiz ?
you &apos;ve reached destination plumbing .
our business hours are from 7 : 00 a.m. to 5 : 00 p.m. ,
monday through friday .
if this is an emergency ,
arturo ruiz . federal agent .
please call our 24 @-@ hour hotline at 212 --
that &apos;s far enough .
take a seat just there .
we must be quite careful now .
my wife ...
yes . you did your very best to try and save her .
it was heroic , in fact .
this business of mine --
it &apos;s an art , not a science .
i &apos;m sorry , patrick . truly , i am .
but try to see objectively
that this works completely to your advantage .
you &apos;re not only a hero now ,
but the world is mourning with you .
never underestimate the power of public sympathy .
the fbi came to see me .
about what ?
i don &apos;t know .
they were asking me a lot
of questions about why i was on the bridge .
i think we should stop -- just for now .
no , stopping now defeats the purpose of what we &apos;ve just done .
we must capitalize on this momentum ,
or it will dissipate .
no .
now we move to the next phase .
the kingmaker killed ruiz to tie up loose ends .
problem is , we &apos;ll never be able to prove it .
m.e. report says it could be suicide ,
but it &apos;s not conclusive .
there &apos;s only trace amounts of gunshot residue
on the right hand .
the stippling &apos;s inconsistent with a contact wound .
on the other hand , suicide is consistent
with someone who just ran an entire family off a bridge .
i also pulled his phone records .
it primarily shows service calls on his business line .
primarily ?
three days ago , ruiz received a call
from a phone booth off 11th and lincoln .
i told you -- there &apos;s nothing here .
if the kingmaker chose that pay phone
of all the phones in the city , there &apos;s a reason .
which is ?
le claire &apos;s pawn shop .
mr. gibbons .
of course , mr. gibbons .
right this way .
thank you .
mr. gibbons . welcome back .
would you like to check your coat ?
no , thank you .
smells like decadence and vice .
the ohlbaum philly , please .
make it two .
what is -- who are these people ?
exactly .
the kingmaker -- he was here ?
that guy over there --
don &apos;t look .
okay . with the hair .
is he why we &apos;re here ?
no .
he won the gold medal for the clean and jerk for belarus --
258 kilograms .
magnificent drinker , smokes like a chimney .
well , hold it , at least . wave it around .
at least look like someone who wants to be here .
the owner will make his rounds soon enough .
my father died of lung cancer .
forgive me .
should we go ?
no .
you sure ?
let &apos;s wait for the owner .
you once said the reason you were here
was because of my father .
what &apos;s this about , lizzy ?
did the two of you know each other ?
don &apos;t tell me you were friends . you don &apos;t have friends .
i knew your father , and he knew me .
is that why you were in his hospital room the day he died ?
i talked to you on the phone that day .
you never mentioned you were there .
no , i didn &apos;t .
there was something he wanted to tell me .
i could tell by his voice the last time we spoke .
but he didn &apos;t .
was that because of you ?
you were at my father &apos;s bedside the day he died .
i &apos;ve been with you almost every day since .
you &apos;ve said nothing -- not a word .
the two of you obviously knew one another ,
but he never mentioned you .
why ?
how did you know each other ?
why were you there ?
i went to see sam before he died .
i said goodbye .
charles .
good to see you again , my friend .
bless you , charles . you are my friend .
natalie here is under the impression i don &apos;t have any .
listen , charles , i need to know
whether this gentleman has been in recently .
oh , i &apos;m not in the business of revealing my clientele ,
but ... considering mali ...
oh , my god ! mali !
the tiniest lady on earth .
what a marvel .
the things she could do .
on her head .
that &apos;s right -- on her head !
i wish you could have met her .
anyway , about your inquiry ,
he was here for dinner a few evenings ago .
mr. king .
how perfectly on the nose .
did he happen to leave a telephone number
when he made his reservation ?
no , but he was complaining
about the heat register at the brixton .
clear .
room &apos;s clean .
what in the hell is this ?
okay , that &apos;s the last one .
yeah , okay , got it .
what are we looking at ?
looks like a private residence .
and comparing the blueprints to the photos ,
i &apos;d say these two places are one and the same .
and the second and third photo i sent you
appear to be alarm codes and wiring schematics .
it &apos;s a breaching plan .
i think you might have found our suspect &apos;s next target .
i want to know who that house belongs to .
wait .
can you blow up that lower @-@ left photo ?
what do you see ?
there in that window . aram ?
one second . let &apos;s get the -- get the fuzzies out .
okay .
v &amp; m security .
can you pull up the alarm codes for the house ?
hold on .
according to v &amp; m &apos;s database ,
the system is registered to an albert r. mitchell .
the u.s. senator ?
the next target , but why ?
because when a senator dies in office ,
it triggers a special election .
and guess who the perfect front @-@ runner would be
to fill the vacancy .
representative patrick chandler .
get out there and place mitchell in protective custody -- now .
get senator mitchell on the line
and alert the property &apos;s security office .
what &apos;s happening ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m calling the police .
there &apos;s no signal .
get in the bathroom and lock the door .
where are you going ?
to check out the house .
get in the bathroom , jeanie -- please .
i can &apos;t get senator mitchell on the line .
we were able to trace the banking information
found in royce &apos;s hotel to accounts linked to chandler .
the payments go back to 2007 .
they &apos;ve been planning this thing for years .
look , take anything you want and go .
no , i &apos;m not interested in your valuables , senator .
who are you ?
it doesn &apos;t matter who i am .
it only matters who they &apos;ll think i was .
the papers will say that it was a burglary gone wrong .
your top @-@ notch security system alerted you to the intruder .
naturally , you went for your weapon ,
only to learn , as so many gun owners tragically do ,
that you &apos;re far more likely
to have that very weapon used against you .
look , i &apos;ll give you anything .
what do you want ?
i want you to vacate your senate seat .
what ... are you talking about ?
submit your resignation .
okay .
sure . whatever you say .
i can do it tomorrow .
unfortunately , on second thought ,
i don &apos;t think i can trust the word of a politician .
i &apos;ll go around the back .
i &apos;ll call it in . i &apos;m up .
i &apos;ve been sitting here for almost 20 minutes .
yeah .
i can &apos;t remember the last time --
ray , before you say what you &apos;re about to say ,
i was told not to come here at all .
you &apos;re feeling disrespected ,
but the fact that i even walked in here
is proof that the opposite is true .
i take it you spoke with your colleagues .
we &apos;re out , ray .
that &apos;s a mistake .
yeah , so you said .
and if the evidence in my possession is compromised ?
we &apos;re big boys . we can do our own risk assessment .
look , for what it &apos;s worth , i voted to step in ,
but others were ...
not as forward @-@ thinking .
the chinese delegation .
there are some among us
who think we should have killed you outright ,
called your bluff about whether or not
you actually have this ...
alleged evidence .
and that would be another mistake .
you know me considerably better
than either of us would like to admit .
i will win this war .
this enemy of mine will lose .
even with you and your shortsighted brethren
watching safely from a distant hill .
why ?
because as bad as you may think i am ,
as far as you think i &apos;m willing to go
to protect that which i hold most dear ,
you can &apos;t possibly fathom
how deep that well of mine truly goes .
you think you &apos;ve come here simply to say
that you can &apos;t help me ,
but all you &apos;ve done is ensure that when this is all over ,
i won &apos;t be able to help you .
when the day inevitably comes
that i settle up with your little alliance ,
it will be you , alan , alone in the dark .
agent keen for you .
what have you got , lizzy ?
the kingmaker .
you have him ?
he was targeting senator mitchell
so that chandler could take his seat .
lizzy , listen to me very closely .
i need you to hold him for me .
10 minutes with him -- that &apos;s all i need .
why ?
there &apos;s a politician in prague .
the kingmaker was hired to take him out of play .
i need to know who commissioned that .
that &apos;s not going to be possible .
it &apos;s the entire reason i brought you this case .
the kingmaker is dead .
red ?
red ?
mr. chandler ! mr. chandler !
will you stop working ...
mr. chandler ? mr. chandler ?
mr. chandler , what happened ?
do you have a few minutes , mr. chandler ,
to answer a couple of questions for us ?
what about the accident ?
mr. chandler , how are you feeling ?
when will you be returning to work ?
our thoughts and prayers
go out to senator mitchell and his family .
i &apos;m pleased to hear he &apos;s stable ,
and i hope he makes a full recovery .
patrick chandler .
yeah ?
you &apos;re under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder .
just smile for the cameras .
aram .
hey . uh , i know you &apos;re , uh , super @-@ busy ,
but there &apos;s something you said that &apos;s been bothering me .
mr. reddington left the hospital at 4 : 37 p.m.
you said your father died almost an hour later ?
right . my father died around 5 : 30 p.m.
what are you getting at ?
i asked the hospital to send over their internal report
taken by the active nurse on duty
at the time of your father &apos;s death .
your father was found by the hospital staff at 5 : 30 p.m. ,
but the medical examiner estimated he died
a little less than an hour before he was found .
when reddington was in the room .
he was there when my father died .
give us a moment .
lizzy , i have an update for you
on the movements of your husband .
apparently , tom has --
were you in the hospital room when he died ?
did you kill my father ?
did you kill him ?
yes .
i was right .
there was something he wanted to tell me before he died ,
and you didn &apos;t want me to know .
it &apos;s not quite that simple .
go to hell .
i don &apos;t expect you to understand .
understand ? !
how could i possibly understand
when you take someone i love away from me
and then try to justify it ? !
listen to me .
i &apos;ve been friends with sam
for all of yours and most of my life .
he was dying .
every part of his body was failing .
he was impatient for it to end .
he &apos;d asked to be disconnected from all the machines .
he was in pain ... and suffering .
and he wasn &apos;t thinking clearly .
if he were ,
he would never have chosen to tell you any of it .
it wasn &apos;t his choice to make .
we said goodbye ...
and i put him out of his misery .
we &apos;re done .
i &apos;m done .
this ends right now .
god , you &apos;re a monster .
i didn &apos;t know where else to go .
