mystic falls ... i was born here .
this is my home .
and mine .
and mine ..
for centuries , supernatural creatures have lived among us .
they were vampires , werewolves , doppelgangers ...
witches .
and even hybrids .
she needs human blood , stefan . from the vein .
if she kills someone , she will crumble .
shouldn &apos;t you be in mystic falls killing vampires ?
anybody gets in my way-- they &apos;re dead .
do i have your attention ?
then let &apos;s talk about vampires .
run as fast as you can .
why are you protecting him ?
klaus will kill anyone who knows !
connor &apos;s tattoo is the key to a cure for elena .
stay the hell away from my brother !
you said you were going to protect jeremy !
i killed someone .
can &apos;t sleep ?
you know ...
it makes sense .
guilty conscience .
you &apos;re not here . i &apos;m ...
i &apos;ve got to be dreaming .
then how do you know that i &apos;m not here ?
because you &apos;re ...
go on . say it .
because you &apos;re dead .
yes .
i am .
was that the first time that you &apos;ve taken a human life ?
you &apos;re a ghost .
it &apos;s got to be-- you &apos;re a ghost .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s what &apos;s happening right now .
je--jeremy .
jeremy !
you &apos;re a ghost .
you &apos;re haunting me . you &apos;re a ghost .
you &apos;re haunting me .
can a ghost do this ?
oh , my god !
jer ! jer !
jer ! jer ! no , no , no !
no . no , jer !
jeremy !
i can &apos;t believe this happened .
what--what am i going to say to him ?
thanks for not ditching the family ring
after it drove ric crazy ?
you should have called stefan .
i don &apos;t want to talk to him .
he &apos;s been lying to me , and hiding things from me .
he compelled jeremy to forget god knows what .
in all fairness , i mean ,
i think you killing him kind of trumps that .
i mean , you should have called stefan .
i don &apos;t trust him right now , damon .
p.s.--i called stefan .
what happened ? why didn &apos;t you call me ?
i just--i need to go upstairs and shower .
clean all the blood off my hands .
welcome back . how you feeling ?
what happened ?
long story . buy the e @-@ book .
elena ?
listen , i know you &apos;re still upset about yesterday ,
and i get it . believe me .
but just ... let me help you .
i don &apos;t want your help right now , stefan .
but you &apos;ll accept damon &apos;s ?
don &apos;t make this about damon !
you &apos;ve been working with klaus doing
god knows what , and don &apos;t insult me by trying to deny it .
listen , it &apos;s not what you think , ok ?
i don &apos;t know what to think .
but i do know that i don &apos;t want to talk to you
and i don &apos;t really want to be around you right now .
look , please , just--
no .
this is my brother &apos;s blood on my hands , stefan .
i stabbed him in the neck last night ,
so forgive me if i &apos;m not in the mood to listen you
try to talk your way out of this .
you &apos;re still going ?
i drank enough last night .
and then i slept , which is what you guys should have done .
we &apos;re just paying our respects to dean .
that &apos;s great , chris , but would you pay them at a bar instead ?
don &apos;t be mad .
we &apos;re celebrating our fallen hybrid friend .
don &apos;t let me interrupt .
i didn &apos;t know you were here .
clearly .
thought i &apos;d just pop &apos; round
to celebrate dean &apos;s successful retrieval
of the vampire hunter .
yet when i arrived ,
i learned that not only was dean unsuccessful ,
but that elena killed the hunter .
maybe if you had let dean use force on connor
instead of sending him in on a suicide mission ...
maybe you should mind your business , wolf girl .
what do you care if connor &apos;s dead , anyway ?
i have my reasons .
they have ceased to matter .
cheers .
brought your stuff . old laptop , your jersey ,
the charm bracelet .
car ...
this isn &apos;t a good time .
just take it .
caroline .
by the break @-@ up drama unfolding before me ,
i assume you &apos;ve met haley .
all right , come on , let &apos;s go .
let &apos;s leave them alone .
your talents are needed elsewhere .
for what ?
i think you &apos;ve got more important things to deal with , mate .
do you think he bought it ?
hell , i bought it .
thanks for the head &apos;s up that he was here , haley .
you girls are good liars .
where &apos;d jeremy go ?
school . bonnie has him volunteering
for some occult exhibit .
or maybe he didn &apos;t want to linger in a house
where his sister just jammed a knife in his neck .
it &apos;s klaus .
ooh , time to face the music ,
pay the piper , dance with the devil .
you know , i &apos;m glad you find this amusing .
if he finds out i told you about the cure ,
he &apos;ll kill both of us .
quit avoiding him . you &apos;re being shady .
shady people get outed .
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
well , i can &apos;t imagine why , what with you ruining
all my plans for a hybrid @-@ filled future .
well , it wouldn &apos;t happened if you hadn &apos;t sworn me to secrecy .
life &apos;s full of ifs , stefan .
let &apos;s extenuate the positives , shall we ?
the hunter was one of five . we &apos;ll find another .
it may take centuries ,
but we &apos;ve got nothing but time , right ?
you &apos;re using your calm voice today . who &apos;s getting killed ?
not you , if that &apos;s what you &apos;re worried about .
but i am concerned about your beloved .
have the hallucinations started yet ?
what do you know about that ?
i &apos;ll tell you . where you are ?
i &apos;m at her house .
how convenient .
so am i.
you know , this would all be a lot more civilized
if i was just invited inside .
bad enough i &apos;m out here talking to you .
what do you know ?
i killed the original five hunters , remember ?
when one kills a hunter ,
there &apos;s a bit of a consequence .
what kind of consequence ?
hunters were spelled by witches to kill vampires .
if you prevent one from fulfilling his destiny ,
then he &apos;ll take you down with him .
what do you mean ? connor &apos;s dead .
i mean , connor &apos;s death won &apos;t prevent him
from making elena his final vampire kill .
she &apos;ll need to come with me now .
i &apos;ll lock her up ;
keep her away from any sharp , wooden objects .
she &apos;s not going anywhere with you .
but if we leave her alone ,
she &apos;ll take her own life before the day is out .
she &apos;s stronger than that .
is she ?
believe me , it &apos;s for her own good .
would you like some ?
you seem to enjoy it when you drink from me .
i wasn &apos;t myself .
i was angry .
were you yourself when you snapped my neck
with your bare hands ?
you staked me !
&apos;cause you &apos;re a monster and you deserve to die .
admit it .
no !
damon ...
decomposition starts in the first 24 hours .
i &apos;m rotting in an unmarked grave because of you .
no !
what &apos;s wrong ?
elena !
elena !
hey , do you see anything on my hand ?
what if i told you i saw the beginning of a mark like connor &apos;s ?
are you serious ?
it showed up after he died .
he told me that i was a potential ;
that that &apos;s why i could see his mark .
so what does that make you , like the next chosen one
or something ?
hey , guys .
hey , april .
way to let her do the heavy lifting .
i found her wandering the hallways with this .
just teasing . i &apos;m the guy
who wrangles all the freaky stuff ,
atticus shane . please , call me shane , i beg you .
thank you guys for helping , i really appreciate it .
y &apos;all get free admission to my free exhibit .
why does he look so familiar ?
no idea .
hey , um , have you guys seen rebekah ?
she said she was going to
help me look into what caused the explosion
at my dad &apos;s farm , and then she just ...
disappeared , yeah , i know .
you lost her ? !
well , &quot; lost &quot;
is a very strong word .
we just technically don &apos;t know where she is .
i &apos;m more worried about
what klaus said about this hunter &apos;s curse .
how does klaus even know about this ?
how does klaus know anything ?
the guy &apos;s like a billion year &apos;s old .
he said it was a witch &apos;s curse .
you know if i could do anything to help , i would , but i--
but nothing . wave your magic wand , hocus pocus ,
be gone , hunter , ghostess , whatever .
the spirits won &apos;t let me do the magic
i need to break the curse .
but i can ask shane for help .
he knows everything about everything .
great . you two do your thing .
where you going ?
to get her back .
let go of me !
certainly .
i apologize for the lack of windows .
it &apos;s to preserve the art .
and , of course ,
to prevent you from taking off your daylight ring
and burning yourself to death in the sun .
i &apos;m not going to kill myself . i would never do that .
oh , but you &apos;ll want to .
i did .
problem is , i &apos;m immortal .
you went through this ?
yes , i did .
for 52 years , four months and nine days .
i was tormented ...
in my dreams .
my every waking moment .
relentless , never @-@ ending torture .
it was the only period of my life when i actually felt time .
so you knew that this would happen if connor died .
that &apos;s why you got involved .
did stefan know , too ?
all he knew was that the hunter had to be kept alive .
you should have listened
to him when he said he had it covered , love .
what else does stefan know ?
well , that &apos;s one of life &apos;s little mysteries , isn &apos;t it ?
how did you make it stop ?
i didn &apos;t .
eventually it just stopped .
the hallucinations tend to appear
in strange forms .
don &apos;t say i didn &apos;t warn you .
he &apos;s got elena . i need tyler to get the other hybrids away
so i can get her out .
i know i &apos;m probably asking the impossible , but ...
actually ...
you &apos;re not .
haley is the one that helped me break the sire bond .
she showed me what to do . how to help .
when she showed up here , i thought it was just coincidence .
but it turns out she &apos;s been helping one of them .
her friend chris .
and she came to help us
get the rest of them out from under klaus .
so ...
are you telling me that chris isn &apos;t sired anymore ?
that &apos;s exactly what he &apos;s telling you .
clothes , toothbrush .
klaus said you &apos;re going to be here
until he figures out where to put you .
just please go away .
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m going to be with you forever .
a constant reminder of what you &apos;ve become .
so tell me .
how did it feel to drain the life out of me ?
it was horrible .
it was the worst thing that i &apos;ve ever done .
you &apos;re lying .
no , i &apos;m not .
yes , you are . tell the truth .
i am telling the truth .
you &apos;re lying .
fine ! i liked it . i loved the taste of your blood .
are you happy ?
i &apos;m not happy , elena .
i &apos;m dead .
did you know i had a family ?
a brother ?
parents .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m really sorry .
i &apos;m really sorry .
are you sorry about your parents ?
it &apos;s your fault they died .
don &apos;t .
they ran off wickery bridge with you in the car ,
but they weren &apos;t supposed to be there , were they ?
they died because of you .
you know i &apos;m not going to stop
until you &apos;ve taken your last miserable breath .
i &apos;m not going to let you do this to me .
then get rid of me .
kill yourself .
you never wanted to be a vampire in the first place .
now look at what you &apos;ve become .
you &apos;re a monster .
and you deserve to die .
you don &apos;t want to listen to me ?
fine .
then how about you and i have a little chat .
katherine ?
did you miss me ?
you &apos;re looking at what people believe to be
the world &apos;s first tombstone .
this item was donated to whitmore college last month .
oh , i just remembered how i know him .
through my dad .
that guy knew your dad ?
yeah . he taught a theology seminar at whitmore last year .
... belonged to a very powerful witch .
a witch so powerful , in fact ,
that silas--that was his name--
created a spell that would grant him ... immortality .
now legend says that silas did the spell
with the help of a lady witch
who loved him , a woman named qetsiyah .
sadly for qetsiyah , silas wanted
to give immortality to another woman .
so qetsiyah killed her and buried silas alive ,
leaving him powerless , immortal , and alone .
this might actually be the origin story
of hell hath no fury like a woman scorned .
you got this ?
yeah . i &apos;ll bring him to you .
now it &apos;s said that
silas wants to rise again .
regain his power .
wreak havoc on the world .
maybe we should be afraid .
or maybe it &apos;s all a bunch of crap
and that &apos;s just an old rock .
all right , listen , enjoy exploring the exhibit .
i &apos;ll be around to answer any questions .
thank you for coming .
hey . you made it .
nice cautionary tale .
qetsiyah sounds like a bad ass .
nothing compared to silas .
don &apos;t you ever stop crying ?
poor elena , always the victim .
except now you &apos;re a killer .
what does stefan think of the new you ?
shut up .
the girl he fell in love with is gone , you know .
you &apos;re like me now . maybe worse .
i made a mistake . i can do better .
no . you can &apos;t .
you &apos;re a vampire . you &apos;ll kill again .
it &apos;ll change you , and it &apos;ll keep changing you
until you &apos;re just like me .
i am nothing like you .
i was you before you even existed .
and when stefan knew the real me ...
he hated me .
now he &apos;s going to hate you , too .
well , at least you still have damon .
shut up !
you &apos;re missing all the adventure , pal .
shane , this is my friend damon .
he &apos;s kind of an expert on this stuff , too .
i audited your class . it &apos;s very enlightening .
that &apos;s right , i remember you .
what &apos;s your specialty ?
the origin of the species .
oh , i think darwin would arm wrestle you for that distinction .
not that species .
you &apos;re into the monster stuff .
all right , awesome .
i was kind of hoping that you might have
stumbled upon this at some point ... maybe .
this is the hunter &apos;s mark . where did you get this ?
came to me in a dream .
you know anything about the hunter &apos;s curse ?
why , you got a dead hunter in the trunk
of your car or something ?
metaphorically speaking .
legend says that if a hunter
is killed by that which it hunts ,
then that person
will be cursed to walk the earth and torment them till ...
until ...
until a new hunter &apos;s awakened
and their legacy &apos;s passed on .
they &apos;re called &quot; potentials . &quot;
listen , i have a bunch of research on it ,
why don &apos;t i go grab it for you .
that would be great . hey , thanks .
how are we supposed to find a potential hunter ?
yeah , about that ...
little gilbert .
your services are needed .
thanks for meeting us .
yeah , well , make it fast . klaus will be back soon .
no , he won &apos;t .
place looks pretty good
considering your hybrid got blown up in it .
caroline .
to what do i owe the pleasure ?
i want you to give elena back .
they sent you to sweet talk me .
well , good form , but i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t do it .
why not ?
she needs my help .
look , i &apos;m not going to burden you with the gory details .
i know you have enough on your plate already .
that &apos;s none of your business , actually .
yes , well , just know that if tyler was still sired to me ,
he never would have hurt you .
i wouldn &apos;t have let him .
can i at least offer you a drink ?
yeah .
thanks .
all you need to do is give me access to elena
and i &apos;ll take it from there .
please , man .
help us , and then you can disappear . you &apos;ll be free .
yeah , until klaus sends one of his other hybrids after me .
haley and i got your back .
we &apos;ll make sure nothing happens .
you were such a good girl when you were a human .
always willing to sacrifice yourself for your friends .
except , weren &apos;t they usually the ones that ended up getting hurt ?
i never wanted that .
bonnie lost her grams because of you .
her mom almost turned into a vampire because of you .
you know , she probably secretly hates you .
did you ever think of that ?
i bet she &apos;d be relieved if you were gone .
i &apos;m not going to kill myself .
why not ? your very existence
brings people nothing but pain .
i mean , maybe it was worth it when you were worth it .
but you &apos;re nothing now .
you &apos;re a monster , elena . you deserve to die .
klaus said you two have to go to tyler .
why ?
something about his girl caroline .
i &apos;ll take over here .
elena .
no !
no , no , no .
hey , it &apos;s me .
no , stay ... stay away from me .
let me help you .
no , elena , stop !
how did i not know any of this stuff about jeremy ?
the witch who loses her powers
get left out of the important conversations .
is everything ok ? ! is it elena ?
we figured out how to help her .
you need to kill a vampire .
oh , great . give me a stake . i &apos;ll kill damon right now .
easy , van helsing . we &apos;ll get you one .
don &apos;t worry .
before you do this ,
you need to know what you &apos;re getting yourself into .
you can rest easy , brother .
we figured out how to solve our little elena problem .
yeah , well ,
now we have a bigger one . i lost her .
what ? again ?
she &apos;s in bad shape .
i tried to help her , but she attacked me .
listen , you go find her , all right ?
talk her down . she &apos;ll listen to you .
just tell me what i need to do to end this .
so here &apos;s the thing .
i didn &apos;t just come here
to try to get you to release elena .
you don &apos;t say .
i came here to distract you
so that stefan could go to your house and break her out ,
which he did . and don &apos;t get mad ,
but then he lost her .
klaus !
caroline .
you &apos;re beautiful ,
but if you don &apos;t stop talking , i will kill you .
they figured out how to stop the hallucinations .
ok .
you have 10 seconds to tell me .
i was ready to die !
you &apos;re a monster .
you &apos;ll kill again .
i can &apos;t be a vampire !
are you ready to die yet ?
you know it &apos;s your only way out of this .
you can &apos;t take back what you did .
it can never be undone .
you &apos;re a monster and you deserve to die .
it &apos;s ok , sweetie .
mom ?
i know what you &apos;re going through .
and it &apos;s ok .
this bridge is ...
where your life should have ended .
not just once , but twice .
you were ready to die , remember ?
i don &apos;t know what to do .
yes , you do , honey .
you know exactly what to do .
that &apos;s right .
the sun will come up and this will all be over .
it &apos;s the right thing to do , elena .
you know it is .
admit it .
because i &apos;m a monster .
and i deserve to die .
i can &apos;t do this .
i can &apos;t leave jeremy .
jeremy is better off without you .
don &apos;t you see that ?
but mom , he won &apos;t have anyone !
he &apos;ll have you .
you &apos;ll be a ghost who helps him ,
not a monster who hurts him .
you &apos;re--you &apos;re right .
i ...
i ...
i &apos;m sorry .
mommy , i didn &apos;t mean to disappoint you .
you didn &apos;t .
you were everything i ever wanted you to be .
but you died .
and you were supposed to stay dead .
elena .
damon ?
how--how did you find me ?
didn &apos;t take a genius to figure it out .
the third time &apos;s a charm ?
you were right , damon .
vampires kill people .
and stefan was right , too .
i can &apos;t live with myself .
look at you .
being all glass is half empty .
let &apos;s just go talk about this before you do something stupid .
ok ?
the sun will be up soon .
it &apos;s almost over .
where &apos;s your ring ?
where &apos;s your ring , elena ?
you &apos;re doing a good thing , chris .
yeah , well , let &apos;s see how
fast a good thing could get me out of town .
call me when you &apos;re safe , ok ?
yeah .
going somewhere ?
when i said don &apos;t let her out of your sight ,
what did you think i meant ?
it &apos;s not his fault !
it &apos;s mine . i was distracting him .
it &apos;s my fault she got away !
and maybe you should be the one to die for it .
no one has to die !
did i not say mind your business ? !
tyler &apos;s covering for me .
i &apos;m the one that let her go .
haley ...
no . you want someone dead ,
go ahead . kill me .
i &apos;d rather die anyway then end up as one
of your sired little bitches .
don &apos;t tempt me , little wolf .
your existence is to serve me .
to please me .
do you understand ?
i &apos;m sorry . i won &apos;t fail you again .
no . you won &apos;t .
get out of here .
no !
jeremy ? !
we need to get you inside .
it &apos;s almost time .
what you &apos;re going through is a curse .
we know how to break it , we just have to get you inside !
don &apos;t let him stop you .
i know you want to .
but you can &apos;t .
don &apos;t .
damn it , elena !
what the hell , man ? !
i &apos;m sorry .
he &apos;s gone .
it &apos;s ok .
damon ?
fished it out of the river for you .
little tip--
vampires hate to swim .
how you feeling ?
my head &apos;s clear .
i can remember everything ,
but not like i lived it .
like it was a really bad dream .
you saved me .
thank you .
well , you know what they say about teenage suicide .
don &apos;t do it .
i just can &apos;t believe that i almost--
you weren &apos;t yourself .
yeah , but if it wasn &apos;t for you ...
i &apos;m about to take a very ...
high and annoying road
and tell you something .
because i know that you think stefan &apos;s been lying to you .
which , yeah . he has .
but this ... rough patch
that you two have been going through ,
it &apos;s not what you think .
everything that he &apos;s been doing , he &apos;s been doing for you .
to help you .
and after he kills me for telling you this ,
i want you to throw my ashes
off of wickery bridge , ok ?
there may be a way out of this for you , elena .
there may be a cure .
tyler .
it &apos;s just us .
paying our respects to chris .
tyler ... we didn &apos;t have a choice .
i told him we had his back .
i told him if he helped us ,
he &apos;d be free .
we needed to help our friend .
yeah , we helped our friend by handing over another friend .
chris wasn &apos;t--
chris was a friend ,
caroline . he &apos;s like me .
he &apos;s part of my pack .
all he wanted to do was be unsired by that disgusting
piece of ...
how did you even get klaus
to agree to give up one of his hybrids ?
i agreed to go on a date with him .
i just thought that it might
help keep up the ruse between you and haley .
what the hell is going on ?
nothing .
nothing at all .
just celebrating the life of a fallen hybrid friend .
bourbon .
make that two .
still saving a spot for mr. saltzman , huh ?
i &apos;d say i &apos;m in the market for a new drinking buddy .
you &apos;re not qualified .
i know that you don &apos;t like me .
but i dug up some stuff about the explosion
at the young farm that i kind of need to tell someone about .
so april mentioned
that her dad knew that professor shane guy .
which wouldn &apos;t be creepy ,
except he had all that info about the hunter &apos;s curse .
and we live in a town where , you know , anybody
who knows stuff is creepy until proven otherwise .
you &apos;re on the verge of impressing me . drive it home .
i got the sheriff to dig up the pastor &apos;s phone records .
turns out , he made like a call a day
to the same number the last month he was alive .
and on the day the council got blown up at the farm ,
he called it ten times .
the office of professor atticus shane .
did your , uh , did your friend damon ...
did he get everything he was looking for in my files ?
yeah . thanks .
i , um ...
i have to ask , how do you know all this stuff ?
bonnie ...
i have been around the world ten times over .
i &apos;ve studied every supernatural creature known to man .
and for the record ,
witches are hands down the most powerful ,
so i &apos;m in your corner all the way ,
i &apos;m your biggest ally .
but let me just say one thing .
when your new hunter , and i know you have one ...
when he completes his mark ,
you &apos;re going to want to come to me .
&apos;cause i &apos;m going to be the only one who can help .
trust me on that , ok ?
the only one .
i &apos;m sorry that i stabbed you .
no , it &apos;s all right .
i probably deserved it .
so , um ...
damon told me that he clued you in .
you didn &apos;t kill him , did you ?
nah , screw the lies and the secrets .
we all want the same thing .
we just have to work together for it .
stefan ...
why did you send damon
to come look for me instead of you ?
i sent him because lately ...
it seems like he &apos;s able to get through to you
in ways that i can &apos;t .
you listen to him .
you trust him .
even when you can &apos;t trust me .
i didn &apos;t mean to not ...
come on , elena .
i mean , after everything that we &apos;ve been through ...
you can admit it .
you have been so strong for me .
helping me .
fighting for that girl that chose you .
the girl that i was when i died on the bridge .
and i love you so much for wanting to find this cure ,
because i &apos;d like nothing more than to get her back .
because the ... the girl that she &apos;s become ...
that ...
that i &apos;ve become ,
is different .
somehow .
darker . i ...
who i am , what i want ...
what you want ?
or ... who you want ?
something &apos;s changed ...
between damon and me .
much more than it ever used to be .
it &apos;s like ...
it &apos;s like everything that i felt for him
before i was a vampire ...
it &apos;s been magnified .
your feelings for him have been magnified .
i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t want to lie to you .
you know , before , when i was the , uh--
the ripper ...
i understood why you cared for him .
