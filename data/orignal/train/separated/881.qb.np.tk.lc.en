growing up , we all have our embarrassing secrets .
* well , i guess it would be nice *
* if i could touch your body *
* i know not everybody *
* has got a body like you , ohh *
mine was that i loved george michael
and i wanted to dance exactly like him .
yep , this was the kind of secret
i didn &apos;t want to tell anyone --
even my best friend , emmy mirsky ,
and we told each other everything .
so , what &apos;s it gonna be , muscles ?
it &apos;s the biggest decision of my life .
just let me think .
what &apos;s to think about ?
brian mcmann made it pretty darn clear .
do you like him ? yes or no ?
can &apos;t i just write in a third box that says &quot; maybe &quot; ?
you &apos;ve been in love with him since first grade .
i &apos;m checking &quot; yes . &quot;
no
okay .
i &apos;m gonna tell you the hugest secret on the planet ,
but you have to swear on our friendship
you won &apos;t ever tell anyone .
okay . i swear on our friendship .
i kissed rob butchenhart behind the gym during the fire drill .
no way !
i &apos;ve spun quite the web .
all right . i &apos;m gonna tell you a secret .
but you got to swear on our friendship ,
under penalty of death , that you won &apos;t ever tell anyone .
done .
i pulled that fire alarm .
what ? ! why ? !
i sat in pudding at lunch .
i didn &apos;t want anyone to misinterpret the situation .
i got something to tell you ,
but you have to swear on our friendship you won &apos;t get mad .
i swear .
i put that pudding cup on your chair .
damn it ! now i can &apos;t get mad .
stupid friendship swear .
you know what ? i &apos;m marking &quot; yes . &quot;
w-- no !
you may wonder -- if we told
all this embarrassing stuff to each other ,
why would i keep my awesome moves a secret ?
this is why .
snuggle monster !
i can &apos;t believe you broke your arm dancing .
it was either that or when mom jumped on me .
i &apos;m so psyched .
this severe compound fracture is my ticket to popularity .
nerd &apos;s right . everybody loves the kid in the cast .
yeah , until everybody finds out how he broke it .
why ?
what &apos;s wrong with a lonely boy in his room videotaping himself
shaking his groove thang to george michael ?
yeah , i hear it now .
just come up with a good lie -- something cool .
got it !
you were van @-@ surfing like stiles from &quot; teen wolf &quot; !
idiot , we don &apos;t have a van .
no , wait -- something about ninjas !
no , wait -- sharks . ninja sharks !
just keep it simple .
say you broke it skateboarding or something .
i &apos;m telling you -- ninja ... sharks .
erica was right -- keep it cool and simple .
and i knew just the thing .
that year , robert zemeckis ,
director of &quot; back to the future ii , &quot;
gave an interview where he admitted
that hoverboards were , in fact , real .
they &apos;ve been around for years .
it &apos;s just that parents &apos; groups
have not let toy manufacturers make them .
but we got our hands on some .
thanks to mr. zemeckis ,
i had a cover story anyone would believe .
hoverboard .
i was on a hoverboard !
it was december 3rd , 1980 @-@ something ,
and just like every night ,
my mom was working her fingers to the bone to make us dinner .
she whisked , balled , and breaded ,
customizing each plate to our tastes .
extra meat sauce .
no meat sauce .
just meat sauce .
and for all the hard work ,
this was the thanks she &apos;d always get .
jello again ?
i hate this stuff .
barf .
excuse me !
i have been slaving over a hot stove all day .
do you know how many meals in a row
i &apos;ve cooked for you people ?
53,000 .
that can &apos;t be right .
thank your mother .
thank you .
ohh . that &apos;s not why i do it .
it &apos;s exactly why she did it .
i mean , sure , my feet ache ,
and i &apos;ve done permanent damage to my arches
and probably ruined a very lucrative dance career ,
but i think it &apos;s worth it .
my dad didn &apos;t normally get involved ,
but when it came to food , he was full of ideas .
you know what , bevy ? i think you should take tomorrow off .
what &apos;s that ?
yeah , a new restaurant opened up around the corner .
it &apos;s called china garden .
chinese food ? never had it , so i don &apos;t like it .
yep , the &apos; 80s was a simpler time ,
when your small town only had four restaurants --
the bar and grill , the sandwich place ,
the other sandwich place ,
and bennigan &apos;s --
which was also a sandwich place .
come on . it looks good .
there &apos;s a happy dragon on the sign patting his full tummy .
you know , dave kim &apos;s parents own that place .
oh ! maybe we can get some free french fries !
hey , stupid .
it &apos;s chinese fries .
well , i &apos;m sold .
let dave kim &apos;s mom deal with
you ungrateful animals for the night .
but there was one thing my mom didn &apos;t count on --
chinese food is the greatest thing ever !
holy balls !
they put pork inside of a pancake --
right inside !
i feel like i &apos;m crying a little .
flavor is literally exploding through the crispy skin ,
right into my taste buds !
it &apos;s a little greasy for my palate .
said my insanely jealous mom .
everybody enjoying the food so far ?
oh , my god , yes .
we &apos;re gonna come tomorrow night
and every other night for the rest of our lives .
dave kim is a very lucky boy .
in that moment , beverly goldberg saw
another mom get something she &apos;d never got before --
true appreciation .
moo shu ?
oh , that was my fault .
um well , it &apos;s ruined now .
i guess that means we should go , huh ?
ah , don &apos;t sweat it .
we &apos;ll get another one of those .
and i &apos;ll tell you what --
a refill on this delicious , exotic tea .
that &apos;s duck sauce .
that is good .
while my mom was feeling overshadowed by pork dumplings ,
i was the center of attention , thanks to my latest injury .
so , how &apos;d you break your arm , klutz ?
i fell off a hoverboard . no biggie .
hey , i heard they &apos;re serving square pizza for lunch . who &apos;s in ?
whoa . wait . you were on a hoverboard ?
as in a flying skateboard ?
we all know what a hoverboard is , dave kim .
this putz .
so , pizza !
wait . are you serious right now ?
true story -- i was walking through the mall ,
and a scientist walked up to me , a real doc brown type ,
and he asked if i wanted to be in a select group of kids
to test hoverboard technology .
yeah , i call bullcrap .
tell us what really happened .
i was losing them .
i either had to expose myself as a dancing loser
or pull out the big guns .
they may not believe me , but you will .
i swear on our friendship .
it happened , people . he floated on air .
wait . now you believe him ?
you can &apos;t lie on a friendship swear .
it &apos;s the rules .
are you kidding me ? ! a hoverboard ?
you were supposed to say something real , like skiing .
well , that &apos;s just crazy .
no one would believe that i can ski .
okay , relax .
every kid tells that one giant lie that gets away from them .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
yes , it is !
if emmy finds out i lied on our friendship ,
she &apos;ll hate me forever .
want my advice , kiddo ?
lie your ass off .
what ? ! you &apos;re supposed to be my role model and moral compass .
we &apos;re talking about muscles mirsky , here .
she &apos;s a groovy dame and a hell of a best friend ,
and we got to do whatever it takes
to save this friendship .
but how ? i &apos;m in too deep .
lucky for you , i &apos;m an expert liar ,
and i &apos;ll teach you because you &apos;re the coolest , smartest ,
most capable brother a girl could ever have .
really ?
no .
but now you see how good i am .
w @-@ what is all this ?
this -- this ... smells .
look , you guys just loved that chinese food so much ,
i figured , why ever go back there
when i can make it all right here ?
i present to you ... beverly &apos;s chinese palace .
you sure you know what you &apos;re doing ?
yeah , chinese food seems kind of complicated .
well , maybe for a less @-@ experienced chef .
that ketchup ?
it &apos;s just a base .
you don &apos;t understand cooking .
okay , all i have to do
is put this block of frozen broccoli
into the boiling @-@ hot grease , and ...
okay .
beverly &apos;s chinese palace is officially closed .
but i can still whip up some of my shrimp parm .
who wants shrimp parm ? huh ?
shrimp parm ? shrimp parm ? shrimp parm ?
shrimp parm !
shrimp parm ! !
last call .
by the end of the week , we had been to china garden 5 times ,
and my mom had had enough .
excuse me .
hi . i don &apos;t know if you remember me .
i &apos;m beverly goldberg .
yes , of course -- you &apos;re the mom who i thought
worked at the school &apos; cause she &apos;s there so much .
i &apos;m involved , yes .
uh , but today , i have a teeny , tiny favor .
i need you to ban my family
from eating here for life , mm &apos;kay ?
but they &apos;re great customers .
we have a dish named after that one --
&quot; big tasty pork . &quot;
it &apos;s fried pork with regular pork on top .
he would love that , yes .
uh , look , let &apos;s talk mother @-@ to @-@ mother , here .
you have kids . you know that dinner is special family time .
i &apos;m sorry , but it &apos;s not my fault
that your family likes my food better than yours .
listen ...
i didn &apos;t come here looking for a war ,
but i didn &apos;t come here to turn one down , either .
i &apos;m not scared of you .
oh , you will be .
watch your back , dave kim &apos;s mom .
at school , i had laid down a thick pile of bullcrap ,
and there was only one person
with the skills to shovel me out .
okay , time to learn america &apos;s greatest art form --
lying .
a liar is , if nothing else , a salesman .
you got to sell your lie ,
and to do that , you got to believe it .
now , tell me a lie .
i &apos;m a fish .
just do the hoverboard thing .
i ... rode a hoverboard .
horrible ! you have like 10 tells !
no eye contact , you &apos;re fidgeting ,
and you smell like fear .
that might be the cast . it &apos;s gotten super @-@ stinky .
smell .
no ! focus !
the number @-@ one rule to lying is to never , ever back down .
just keep lying until you come out the other side .
other side -- got it .
now , look me in the eye and make me believe it .
i rode a hoverboard .
again .
i rode a hoverboard .
again .
i rode a hoverboard .
again .
i rode a hoverboard ! !
okay .
odd thing to say when we &apos;re talking about mitochondria ,
but , uh , since you brought it up ,
i feel obligated as your science teacher
to inform you all that hoverboards aren &apos;t real .
well , that &apos;s your opinion .
no , that &apos;s the opinion of gravity .
it &apos;s a gray area .
couldn &apos;t be clearer .
well , we can agree to disagree .
no , we can &apos;t .
hold up . are you calling adam a big , fat liar ?
with all due respect to mr. goldberg ...
100 % , yes .
well , you &apos;re a 100 % dook .
principal &apos;s office -- now .
worth it !
as for the rest of you ,
science is based on empirical evidence ,
so unless mr. goldberg here can provide some ,
i will implore you all not to believe a word he says .
i have a video .
you have a video ?
you have a video ?
i said &quot; principal &apos;s office &quot; !
in your face ! he &apos;s got a video !
if that &apos;s true , then everything i know about science would be wrong
and reality as we know it would shatter .
dogs would fly .
i would be dating claudia schiffer !
so ... we cool ?
oh , yeah . we cool .
so cool that if you show that video in class ,
i &apos;ll give everyone in here an &quot; a. &quot;
how was school , poopie ?
worst day ever .
hey , can i curl up in a ball on the way back while you drive ?
aww , schmoo , what &apos;s wrong ?
you can tell mama anyth--
oh , is that dave kim ?
dave kim ! dave kim !
what are you doing ? !
let &apos;s invite him over for dinner .
i don &apos;t want to invite him over for dinner !
just lay down in the way back and be sad , okay ?
dave kim ! adam wants to invite you over for dinner , dave kim !
no , no , no , no , no . no , no , no . drive , drive , drive !
dave kim ! please be our guest at our home tonight !
if you want to come over , just get in the backseat now .
drive !
dave kim !
well ! if it isn &apos;t dave kim &apos;s mom .
funny you should drop on by .
you called me to pick up my son .
did i ?
well , yes , he &apos;s here ,
just going to town on my shrimp parm .
he loves my cooking .
maybe even more than yours .
mom , you got to try this .
it &apos;s both fishy and cheesy .
you can &apos;t put cheese on seafood !
it breaks every culinary law !
i &apos;ll put cheese on anything .
anything .
you can &apos;t cheese anything .
i once cheesed a slice of watermelon .
that &apos;s disgusting .
or is it delicious ?
this is delicious .
enjoy .
i told him to come back tomorrow night with his sister .
jenny , is it ? sweet girl .
she &apos;s gonna love my mac- &apos; n &apos; -cheese meatballs .
that &apos;s right .
i &apos;ll combine an entree and side into a super @-@ dish .
i don &apos;t give a ...
you don &apos;t want to take me on , lady .
this is one food war you can &apos;t win .
oh , i &apos;ll win .
shrimps will be cheesed , tummies will be stuffed ,
and your kids will be begging to come here
during special family @-@ dinner time .
so , what &apos;s it gonna be ?
i &apos;m sorry , gentlemen . we can &apos;t serve you here .
you &apos;re talking to those two , right ?
i don &apos;t understand .
why are we on the wall , like a bunch of criminals ?
yeah ! i need my big tasty pork !
please ! it &apos;s my birthright !
let &apos;s just say ...
some mothers love their family so much , it &apos;s scary .
beverly .
while my dad was heading back to deal with my mom ,
i was heading back to the future !
unfortunately , in my version ,
the future looked kind of crappy .
yippee !
here i am ,
testing out the world &apos;s first actual hover--
it &apos;s squishing my parts .
cut . i can see the rope . this looks shoddy .
you think ?
you said to keep lying till i get to the other side .
when do i get to the other side ?
just shut up and hover !
god .
oh . yeah . there . just like that . yep .
that actually looks not that crappy .
damn it .
cut ! someone &apos;s in the shot .
i can &apos;t see ! spin me around !
oh ! spin me back !
are you kidding me ? !
emmy , i can explain .
here are your get @-@ well cookies .
come back !
emmy ! wait !
i don &apos;t want to talk to you .
just let me explain .
no .
i stood up for you .
i got an in @-@ school suspension and grounded for a month .
but even worse --
i told a bunch of people hoverboards are real !
trust me , the truth is too embarrassing .
you would &apos;ve lied , too .
not to you .
i &apos;m sorry , okay .
but ... it &apos;s me .
you can &apos;t hate your best friend .
that &apos;s the thing .
you &apos;re not just a friend .
you &apos;re like ... my brother .
and if i can &apos;t count on you ...
then i have nobody .
and just like that ,
my best friend hovered out of my life .
bev ! you &apos;ve got a lot of nerve !
we &apos;re grown men . you cannot control us .
don &apos;t be silly . of course i can .
fine ! you can !
but the one freedom we have is food ,
and you can &apos;t take that away from us .
i won &apos;t let you !
let &apos;s discuss it over dinner .
sit down .
i made cheeseburger meatloaf .
behold my mom &apos;s secret weapon .
it was cheese . it was meat . it was loaf .
and it was spectacular .
no ! the woman &apos;s just trying to use your hunger to control you .
just a little taste .
no taste !
can we at least munch some of the topping ?
no ! we &apos;re never eating her food again .
well , china garden &apos;s not an option ,
so where else you gonna go ?
we &apos;ll go to bamboo palace downtown .
come on , guys ! let &apos;s go !
you &apos;d never drive into the city during rush hour .
oh , i will for this .
well , then i &apos;ll have you banned from there , too --
banned from chinatown entirely .
then we &apos;ll switch to indian food .
your stomach can &apos;t handle the spices .
then we &apos;ll get sushi !
raw fish ? you don &apos;t even like raw carrots .
then we &apos;ll get thailand food !
that &apos;s right -- food from wherever that is !
why are you working so hard to take this away from me ?
take what away from you ?
you &apos;re acting crazy ! it &apos;s just dinner !
not to me !
you all have your other things going on --
your work , your school , your hypersexual lifestyle .
hey .
for me , this kitchen , these meals --
it &apos;s all i &apos;ve got .
it &apos;s the only thing i still do that makes me feel needed .
so , yeah , maybe that makes me crazy ,
but cooking for my family means everything to me .
emmy had found out that i &apos;d never rode a hoverboard .
it was only a matter of time
before the rest of the class learned the truth .
there was no way out .
i have a way out .
it &apos;s too late .
i don &apos;t have time to come up with a whole new web of lies .
that &apos;s why i did it for you .
i got lainey to steal this from her dad &apos;s sketchy law office .
non disclosure agreement ?
just say that the scientist from the mall made you sign it
and you legally can &apos;t show your hoverboard video .
class has started , mr. goldberg .
we &apos;re all waiting for you to take us into the future .
ohhh ! oh , i &apos;m hovering !
so , i know everyone was excited to see that video
of me hoverboarding ,
but i @-@ i can &apos;t show it .
you know what ? instead , i &apos;ll show you this .
this is how i really broke my arm .
* i guess it would be nice *
* if i could touch your body *
* i know not everybody *
* has got a body like you *
oh , man !
i wanted that easy &quot; a , &quot; but this is so much better .
well , sorry , pal . i was rooting for you .
no , you weren &apos;t .
that &apos;s right .
&apos;cause i always root for science .
emmy !
so ... now you know the truth .
changes nothing .
all you did was expose yourself as a wham ! fan .
technically , it &apos;s george michael &apos;s solo effort .
but ... probably not your point .
um , so , it &apos;s friday night .
see you at the treehouse ?
dude , what part of this don &apos;t you get ?
no , i get it .
but you said it yourself -- we &apos;re more than just friends .
we &apos;re family .
and in my family , we fight , scream ,
and make horrible mistakes that go way too far .
but an hour later , we &apos;re fine .
that &apos;s what it means to be a goldberg ,
and , like it or not , you &apos;re one of us .
if you &apos;re looking for food ,
i got your ban lifted at china garden .
enjoy your exotic new lives .
bevy , we thought all about what you said ,
and we &apos;re sorry .
how could you ever think this family doesn &apos;t need you ?
i mean , look at us !
we &apos;re a mess !
we &apos;d be living under a rock if it wasn &apos;t for you .
well , you got a point there .
we appreciate what you do for us .
and dad didn &apos;t even tell me to say that .
thank you -- honestly .
now , what do you say we have some real dinner ?
and with that , a new goldberg tradition began --
our friday @-@ night dinner at china garden .
big tasty pork -- on the house .
we &apos;re glad you &apos;re back .
hey , c @-@ calm down . all right , good .
hey , klutz .
so ... you don &apos;t hate me ?
after showing that tape ,
you &apos;re gonna need all the friends you can get .
just ... don &apos;t ever lie to me again .
i swear it on our friendship .
so , how &apos;s the cast ?
oh , it &apos;s so itchy .
it &apos;s driving me crazy .
i have skinny fingers . let me see if i can help .
that &apos;s just tickling me .
that &apos;s the thing about family .
you fight , you yell , but in the end ,
there &apos;s no one you &apos;d rather share chinese with .
emmy , there are some people in your life right now
that you sort of have these kind of crushes on .
now , out of all these people ,
is there anyone you particularly like the most ?
do i have to say this on film ?
well , i mean , it &apos;s not gonna --
no one &apos;s gonna see it or anything .
uh , i don &apos;t -- i &apos;m not sure i can trust you with that .
oh , you can trust me .
i &apos;m telling you , notre dame &apos;s gonna go all the way this year .
what , to some random bowl game ?
there &apos;s never gonna be a true national champion
until we have a playoff system .
that &apos;s a good idea . they should do that .
i was kidding !
they &apos;re never gonna do that !
what are you getting so excited ?
because you &apos;re aggravating me !
stop aggravating him and come have dinner .
erica !
turn off the music and get down here !
* and when that love comes down *
* without devotion *
* well , it takes a strong man , baby *
* but i &apos;m showin &apos; you the door *
* &apos; cause i gotta have -- *
i have faith .
what are you doing here ? !
your mom &apos;s making seafood pizza . i can &apos;t miss that .
i swear to god , you better not tell a soul about this .
oh , no , no . this one &apos;s just for dave kim .
i &apos;m serious . you tell no one .
of course . i swear on our friendship .
what friendship ?
so , it &apos;s more than that ?
get out !
