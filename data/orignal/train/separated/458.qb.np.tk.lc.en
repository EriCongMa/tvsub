all that remains
mom , your pearls , really ?
oh , i think they &apos;re nice .
just try them .
wow , look at you !
you &apos;re so pretty , sera .
isn &apos;t she , dad ?
just like her mom .
oh , stop .
let me do it .
ok .
all right , you got it ?
yeah .
all right , here you go .
if this guy touches you , he &apos;s dead .
i &apos;m serious .
dad .
just please don &apos;t say that to him .
stop embarrassing her , bruce .
i want to go to homecoming .
soon enough , little one .
i am not so little .
911 . what &apos;s your emergency ?
oh , god .
hello ? what &apos;s your emergency ?
is anyone there ? hello ?
sir ?
they &apos;re gone . my girls are gone .
i need your help .
when you say girls , do you mean your daughters ?
yes .
all right , i need you to stay on the line , sir .
please confirm where you &apos;re calling from .
1721 hillcrest drive .
this can &apos;t be happening .
what &apos;s your name , sir ?
bruce . bruce morrison .
how old are your daughters , mr. morrison ?
13 and 17 .
when was the last time you saw them ?
they went to bed around 9 : 30 .
no , wait . it was monday .
sera has a study group , so it was more like 10 : 00 .
sir , today is wednesday .
you haven &apos;t seen them since monday ?
no . no , that can &apos;t be right .
i &apos;m sorry , sir , but it is .
today is wednesday .
no .
the police have been alerted , sir , and they &apos;re on their way .
that call came in an hour ago .
how does a single father
lose his teenage daughters for 36 hours ?
he doesn &apos;t .
his girls are gone .
he doesn &apos;t blame anyone .
and he doesn &apos;t use any buzzwords
first responders are trained to hear .
he never says missing , abducted , runaway .
maybe that &apos;s what they did , though . maybe they ran away .
there &apos;s no history of that .
the likelihood of a stranger abduction
in a neighborhood like this is rare .
i &apos;ve counted 7 turns from the entrance to their driveway .
no one just stumbled onto the house .
and where &apos;s the mother ?
could this be a parental child abduction ?
uh , doubtful . exactly one year ago today he made this call .
911 . please state your emergency .
my wife is gone .
confirm where are you calling from .
1721 hillcrest drive .
she &apos;d also been missing for two days
before he contacted authorities , and she &apos;s never been found .
this man is either the victim of a serial offender
or he is one .
please tell me this guy &apos;s in custody .
the salisbury police are at his home
and they &apos;ve been there since the call came in .
there are hard copies and tablet copies
of both case files on the plane .
it &apos;s a short flight to the eastern shore .
there &apos;ll be more when you land .
&quot; love never dies a natural death .
it dies of blindness and errors and betrayals .
it dies of weariness , of witherings , of tarnishings . &quot;
anais nin .
bruce and judy morrison
were well liked and active in the community .
all signs point to them living a quiet life .
he &apos;s a writer and a professor ,
and it looks like she got into real estate a few years ago .
&apos;02 , before the market crashed .
well , 10 years later judy had an affair with a co @-@ worker ,
a jeff godwin ?
that was discovered in the investigation
but never made it in the papers .
bruce morrison was a prime suspect ,
but they never found any evidence
and the affair wasn &apos;t deemed enough of a motive .
the university &apos;s put him on sabbatical since then .
he &apos;s been writing forever , and he &apos;s been teaching since 1985 .
transcript says he was grief @-@ stricken
and couldn &apos;t handle the pressure .
not many people could .
the odds of this event striking the same family
on the same day must be a billion to one .
close enough .
judy inherited money from her family
and it &apos;s in a trust for the girls .
ah , jeez , please tell me
he did not get rid of his wife for money .
bank records indicate he hasn &apos;t touched the funds ,
despite the depleting supplemental income from the university .
yeah , but it could be a combo platter .
revenge and profit .
his wife cheated and he retaliated in anger .
that might not be a surprise , but that doesn &apos;t explain
why he would harm his own children .
the oldest daughter sera had a 4.0 gpa ,
but she didn &apos;t apply to a single college back east .
she accepted a stanford early admission .
maybe her father saw going that far away as a form of betrayal .
the second one in a year .
first his wife of 27 years fools around
and then probably threatens to end the marriage .
a year later , the daughter can &apos;t wait to leave .
abandonment could be the common denominator .
there is another possibility .
maybe bruce morrison didn &apos;t do it .
the family have any enemies ?
the only person that might fit that would be jeff godwin .
looks like he had a pretty solid alibi
the night judy went missing .
he was wining and dining his own wife
at a local restaurant .
so the only viable suspect back then
was the same one we have now .
all the answers are in that house .
marty friedman . thanks for making the trip .
we got search and rescue combing the woods
and the choptank and wicomico rivers .
we &apos;re dredging all the way from here to the chesapeake .
i &apos;m not letting this guy get away with it again .
has he said why he took a day to call ?
claims he doesn &apos;t remember .
he &apos;s been glued to his computer .
maybe he needs new material for a novel .
we &apos;ll work alongside your team if that &apos;s all right .
whatever you need .
everybody take a room .
mr. morrison ,
i &apos;m aaron hotchner from the fbi .
my team &apos;s here to help gather information to find your children .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
but shouldn &apos;t you be out there looking for my girls ?
we have to start where they were last seen .
i know you think i did this .
they all do .
sir , we &apos;re not here to accuse you .
we want to find your daughters .
well , so do i.
so if someone calls with a ransom demand ,
do you have the means to trace the call ?
no one &apos;s calling .
we &apos;ll have our analyst set up what we call a trap and trace
back at quantico.- thanks .
i &apos;m told you have sera &apos;s phone .
it &apos;s on the dining room table .
and katie &apos;s phone ?
i looked for it in her room . i couldn &apos;t find it .
i &apos;ve made some flyers .
detective , would it be possible
for one of your officers to help get them out ?
that &apos;s a good idea .
it looks like katie stayed in a lot .
she has a schedule of when she was gonna try new recipes .
she seems like a really sweet girl .
her charger &apos;s here but the phone is not .
maybe it &apos;s with her ?
yeah , i &apos;ll have garcia track it .
it &apos;ll only work if it &apos;s on , though .
it &apos;s worth a try .
if the girls had access to a phone and they were ok ,
they would have called for help by now .
nothing in the past year since her mom disappeared .
it looks like she kept it all bottled up .
except when she was assigned to write .
there &apos;s a lot of papers in here from her creative writing class .
her dad &apos;s a writer and english professor .
maybe she was trying to get his attention .
what is it ?
are most high school seniors this neat ?
trash is empty . bed &apos;s perfectly made .
so is that what he did for two days ,
clean the house ?
we let the housekeeper go
when i was forced to take a sabbatical last year .
are you angry about that ?
angry ? i don &apos;t have the energy for that anymore .
how are you keeping up with everything ?
the girls and i do the best we can .
judy liked an orderly house ,
and i keep hoping that she &apos;ll walk back through that door .
you just did laundry but only your clothes .
i was wondering , did you do that
before or after you called 911 ?
i did it when i woke up in the morning ,
before i knew the girls were missing .
mr. morrison , you understand that we can only help you
if you tell us everything that happened .
katie was asleep when sera came home late .
she said that she drove slow because of the rain .
that &apos;s all i remember .
oh , and i was watching basketball .
and then ?
i went to bed , i guess .
it &apos;s happened before .
i can &apos;t explain it ,
but the next thing i know , it &apos;s morning .
and i could feel that something was wrong .
sera , you &apos;re late !
katie , sera , your alarm &apos;s going off .
did you oversleep ?
girls !
girls !
sera .
girls ?
katie ?
girls !
katie ! sera !
911 . what &apos;s your emergency ?
oh , my god .
hello ? what &apos;s your emergency ?
is anyone there ? hello ? sir ?
they &apos;re gone . my girls are gone .
i need your help .
i just--i can &apos;t stand here and do nothing .
i have judy &apos;s sister coming in .
we have to find the girls .
how much longer do you need to be standing here .
shouldn &apos;t we be out there looking ?
hello .
hi , karen .
no , nothing yet .
all right , thanks .
so , he does own a 12 @-@ gauge shotgun .
the police catalogued it a year ago .
but ballistics proved
that it hadn &apos;t been fired in years .
where is it now ?
he claims he doesn &apos;t know , but i &apos;m not finished .
he also bought a used .38
just after judy &apos;s disappearance ,
and now he claims he doesn &apos;t know where that is either .
well , if he used it , it might explain
why he threw his clothes in the wash this morning .
so the clothes would be compromised .
he did sleep in here , though .
we should have these sheets tested for gunshot residue .
excuse me . uh , excuse me .
will you bag the sheets , please ?
there &apos;s some muddy boots by the back door .
we should test those , too .
well , it appears he still sleeps on his side of the bed .
look at that .
his wife &apos;s things haven &apos;t been cleaned out .
maybe he really is in mourning .
our analyst is checking phone logs .
we did the same last year ,
but it &apos;s like judy morrison just vanished .
i couldn &apos;t even find her phone or appointment book
to see who her last meetings were with .
take a look at this .
when does recycling get picked up ?
monday mornings .
so these are new .
last year he said he was in recovery
but had fallen off the wagon because of judy &apos;s affair .
he hasn &apos;t mentioned this at all .
i always thought he was drinking more than he admitted .
wondered if he was popping pills , too ,
but we could never find any evidence .
well , let &apos;s go ask him .
mr. morrison ,
did the girls leave often without you knowing ?
no . look , i &apos;ve told you everything .
i gotta ask you ,
are two bottles of bourbon a normal monday night ?
it wasn &apos;t really two .
there was only a little bit left in the first one .
it was a rough day .
monday was the year anniversary of when judy went missing .
you think we don &apos;t know that ?
there haven &apos;t been many days this year
when i haven &apos;t been very aware of your wife having gone missing .
what happened monday ?
did it all come rushing back and you just snapped ?
no . i was sad and i drank too much
because i miss my wife .
honestly , bourbon doesn &apos;t help much .
it helped you lose an entire day from what i can tell .
why don &apos;t we head upstairs .
detective .
look , i understand that you &apos;re frustrated ,
but you &apos;re not helping yourself taking it out on him .
i thought this guy was dirty a year ago ,
and now it &apos;s happened again .
there are no bodies , no evidence ,
no nothing but my gut and 25 years of police work .
hey , baby girl .
have you found them yet ?
i &apos;m about to join the search .
good . ok . i don &apos;t know the location of katie &apos;s cell ,
which means the battery &apos;s dead , but i pulled phone records
for both the girls , and holy cannoli ,
they text more than i do .
more sera than katie , but still ...
anything suspicious ?
it looks like just friendly , rapid @-@ fire repeat numbers ,
probably all known contacts .
uh , last activity was monday at 9 : 55 p.m.
well , that matches the dad &apos;s story .
i &apos;m wading through the most used numbers first .
i will hit you back when i know who &apos;s who .
i &apos;m hanging up hard , like the strength of my love .
she had a lot of hobbies before she started selling real estate .
yeah , family projects .
devoted mom .
you ready , reid ?
yeah .
excuse me .
do you mind if i ask you a question .
he killed them , too , did he ?
sorry ?
did that son of a bitch hurt his daughters ?
sir , how well do you know the family ?
they moved in when we did .
my wife always liked his wife .
and you and mr. morrison ?
got nothing in common with that drunk .
told me he was gonna shoot my dog .
i used to let my girls , you know , roam around the yard here .
they &apos;d bark occasionally , but never too long .
and then one night that idiot comes out ,
hammered ,
and he tells me that he can &apos;t work
because my dog &apos;s yapping .
and then he says he wouldn &apos;t be surprised
if one of them was found dead .
the man is nuts .
the morrison girls were last seen monday night .
did you see them at all ?
no . but morrison sounded drunk and belligerent again .
it was about 10 : 00 .
he didn &apos;t tell you that , did he ?
were both cars home ?
well , i &apos;m not spying on the guy or anything ,
but we were out here a little later .
i noticed his car was gone .
then when i turned &quot; letterman &quot; off ,
it was back .
why did you stop going to your meetings ?
i was two years sober .
then judy has this affair .
i guess i needed something , so i started drinking again .
what would you do ?
your daughters testified that you and judy had had a fight
the night that she disappeared .
that &apos;s right . so ?
and a neighbor heard an argument here on monday night .
who told you that , chip gordon ?
he &apos;s a lonely old man .
and since when is having an argument with teenagers
against the law ? it doesn &apos;t mean i hurt them .
did you ?
no !
yeah , morgan , what do you got ?
how much does the alcohol abuse account for the time lost ?
i don &apos;t know .
it doesn &apos;t mean that i hurt my daughters .
where are katie and sera ?
i don &apos;t know !
hotch .
sera could be close !
i want teams working a 5 @-@ mile radius !
keep working upstream !
get those dogs working !
5 miles down !
we found katie &apos;s body in the reeds .
it &apos;s near , uh ...
katie , katie ...
so what do you think ?
i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s sober , so this is raw emotion .
he lost his legs when hotch told him .
the tears could be guilt as much as grief .
because that &apos;s what we &apos;re supposed to do
when given that news .
i don &apos;t mean to sound so cynical ,
but the man writes fiction .
any sign of sera ?
maybe she &apos;s still out there .
doubtful , unless she &apos;s found shelter .
it &apos;s supposed to be in the 20s tonight .
now that we &apos;ve got katie &apos;s body ,
we should run scenarios for what really happened on monday night .
that was the lab . bruce definitely fired a gun at some point .
there &apos;s residue on the sheets and on the boots .
we need to get him to the station .
biotic decomposition is slower in the winter months ,
and since her body wasn &apos;t immersed in the river ,
it wasn &apos;t deteriorated ,
so i can tell you a little more than i thought .
sorry .
i knew katie .
she and my daughter were in class together .
we &apos;re sorry .
me , too .
she was killed between 24 and 48 hours ago .
cod is blunt force trauma to the squama of the occipital bone .
like from the butt of a gun ?
that &apos;s possible .
so she was found near the river but she didn &apos;t drown ?
no fluid in her lungs .
the water was only a method of disposal .
her nails have traces of skin packed under them .
so we need to look for defensive wounds on her father .
mr. morrison , i need to ask you to roll up your sleeves .
what ?
please .
i saw these in the shower this morning when i woke up .
i have no idea how i got them .
did they happen during the fight ?
it wasn &apos;t a fight . it was just parenting .
did the detective tell you about jeff godwin ?
you should talk to him .
he still coaches sera &apos;s soccer team ,
even though it &apos;s ridiculous .
every time i ask you a question ,
you have this habit of deflecting attention onto someone else .
all of her latest writing assignments are very dark .
yeah , i saw those , too .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s part of her mom &apos;s absence .
well , she &apos;s had her fair share of suffering .
all right , so you think she &apos;s alive .
yeah , i have to .
if losing her mother didn &apos;t change everything ...
i know losing her sister certainly will .
i didn &apos;t know .
how old were you when your sister died ?
11 .
she was 17 .
go ahead , garcia .
i think i may have found something creepy .
there &apos;s a bunch of text messages between sera
and a number that i have traced back to jeff godwin .
why would your missing mother &apos;s ex @-@ lover stay in touch ?
more than a little inappropriate .
and here &apos;s a text from j.g.
please tell me there was nothing strange
going on between him and the daughter .
it seems more fatherly . listen to this .
&quot; it &apos;s gonna be ok . you just have to stay strong .
is he encouraging her to leave ?
or for her to face her father in some way ?
well , what about the texts on monday ?
there aren &apos;t any .
the latest were from sunday night .
no , no , no , yes , there are . i &apos;m looking at the phone records .
there &apos;s texts between them on monday between 5 : 23 and 5 : 56 p.m.
weird .
yeah .
hey , blake .
morgan , we need you to find jeff godwin .
uh , he just walked in .
he did ?
says he heard we found katie
and he &apos;s worried about sera .
he also texted sera the night she went missing
and then deleted the texts .
it looks like they texted a lot .
really ?
mr. godwin , why did you feel it was appropriate
to regularly text a 17 @-@ year @-@ old girl ?
i &apos;ve know those girls for a long time ,
way before anything happened between me and their mother .
look , i coach sera .
you didn &apos;t think to request a different team ,
given the circumstances ?
no . my daughter plays on the team .
look , sera reached out to me monday night .
god knows she needs a father figure .
maybe the man her mother had an affair with
might not be the best person to offer that .
look , i just came in here because i heard about katie
and i was worried about sera . don &apos;t treat me like a criminal .
sera deleted texts that the two of you shared
the same day she disappeared .
hey , wait , ok . they &apos;re all here .
we agreed to meet in the parking lot
of a convenience store on route 113 .
read them . go ahead .
is this a regular thing for you ?
well , we &apos;ve met there a couple times recently ,
when she was really scared
about what was happening with her and her dad .
what was happening ?
bruce gets really violent when he drinks ,
and it &apos;s been getting worse .
sera had every reason to be terrified .
i mean , look what happened .
is everyone there ?
um , this call came in on monday .
it was made on katie &apos;s cell , which is still mia .
the only 800 number she called
was to a local abuse hotline .
she called there a few times in the last couple of months .
my name is katie morrison . i called last week .
yes , katie , i remember you .
he &apos;s at it again . he &apos;s just going crazy .
he &apos;s really drunk .
katie , are you safe ?
yes . hold on .
hi , it &apos;s sera . we &apos;re ok . i can handle this .
who are they taking to ?
girls , open the door !
i don &apos;t understand .
katie , open the door .
just stop now !
i said open the door !
it &apos;s a lay @-@ up .
off the rim ...
have you even talked to katie today ?
shh ...
are you serious , dad ?
you are such a pathetic father .
get out of my way !
girls , open the door !
katie ?
open the door .
i said open the door !
i said open the door !
oh , my god .
what a pathetic little crybaby .
ugh . i was always right about you , huh ?
so you got old brucie in a cage , huh ?
you think that &apos;s gonna help ?
it &apos;s only gonna make him hide longer .
what do you want to know ?
i &apos;m gonna have to tell you &apos; cause the baby &apos;s got his pacifier .
where &apos;s sera ?
she &apos;s learning a lesson .
what did you do to them ?
what did you do to them ?
i scared them , that &apos;s all . they needed it .
why ?
because they &apos;re spoiled , ungrateful little bitches
who walk all over him any chance they get .
what happened to to bruce ?
he &apos;s hiding , of course .
see ...
when he can &apos;t handle it , i save his ass .
bruce &apos;s problem is ,
he can &apos;t handle anything .
i give you a psychopath , but dual personality ?
if that &apos;s true , where was that guy a year ago ?
these conditions have triggers .
his accelerated drinking could have agitated it .
with all due respect , i don &apos;t buy it .
the guys knows he &apos;s dead meat
and this is an easy way to cop an insanity plea .
i hear you , but we need to see if he &apos;s got markers
for a dissociative identity disorder .
you do what you need to do . i think it &apos;s a waste of time .
so bruce said katie baked cookies monday night .
we found them in the kitchen , so that &apos;s true .
and two of sera &apos;s friends confirmed
she never made it to her study group .
that &apos;s because jeff godwin was in the parking lot
with her from 8 : 15 to 9 : 30 .
and the girls called the hotline at 9 : 58 .
detective , have your officers found either gun ?
no , but we &apos;ve increased the search ,
given where katie &apos;s body was found .
we &apos;ve got residue , but we don &apos;t know
which gun or where it is now .
look , whoever that was in there
said he wanted to scare them , not hurt them .
katie was beaten over the head in the middle of nowhere .
you &apos;re right . the alter could have lost his temper ,
or it could have just been a horrible accident .
but getting the girls out of the house was planned .
he said he wanted to scare them and had a gun to do it .
and then he drove them somewhere .
bruce &apos;s car had the same mud on the driver &apos;s side floor
that he had on his boots , but there wasn &apos;t any in the backseat .
so 3 people drove somewhere ,
but only he came back .
and the dna coming back from katie &apos;s nails
will tell us what we already know--
that bruce morrison did this .
so can i arrest him now ?
detective , you have sufficient evidence to make the arrest ,
but we still don &apos;t have sera .
give us an hour and maybe he &apos;ll tell us where she is .
it &apos;s your call , but he could still help us .
ok . one hour .
what happened ?
what do you remember ?
you played me some tape of the girls ,
and then i don &apos;t know .
when did your blackouts start ?
in grad school .
there was a lot of pressure and i &apos;d drink .
i feel like i &apos;m losing my mind .
i couldn &apos;t do that .
please tell me i didn &apos;t do that .
there &apos;s no way for us to confirm a d.i.d. diagnosis yet ,
but we do know that he has chronic alcoholism ,
which can and has gone hand in hand with it .
the interesting thing is , his liver and pancreas
wouldn &apos;t have survived 30 years of that kind of abuse ,
so there must have been years where he &apos;s gotten help .
he was in a program .
it would have to be more than that . garcia ,
has he ever been on medication to help curb his drinking ?
all i &apos;ve got is a yearly physical and that is it .
d.i.d. usually stems from a history of sexual abuse .
ok , well , i &apos;ve got nothing like that .
all i have known bruce morrison
is that his mother died when he was 10 ...
there &apos;s your abandonment issue .
and he was raised by a single alcoholic father ,
and there &apos;s no evidence of any prescriptions .
they look like the perfect family ,
but she would have had to
know about his drinking when they got married .
so you &apos;re saying she helped manage him
and kept his problem a secret .
maybe she was the one that got the prescription .
garcia , can you run her medical history ?
yeah . hold on ...
ok . disulfiram .
am i saying that right ? it &apos;s for chronic alcoholism .
she had a 90 @-@ day supply delivered 4 times a year
for as long as i can tell .
and it stopped coming a few months ago .
it makes you just feel nauseous if you drink alcohol .
but she isn &apos;t the one who had a drinking problem . he is .
garcia , who canceled it ?
please hold while i dig .
could that be the trigger ?
he goes after his daughters now that he &apos;s off his meds ?
that instability could work for us .
hey , i--i didn &apos;t--
hey , i didn &apos;t agree to this .
well , we &apos;re looking for sera ,
and you &apos;re the last ones to see her alive .
look , like i told your guy here ,
i had nothing to do with this . and sera &apos;s afraid of him .
do you want to tell us about your relationship with sera ?
i don &apos;t have one .
well , that &apos;s strange .
why do you text her all the time , then ?
jeff , it &apos;s not that big of a leap .
you couldn &apos;t have judy anymore , so you thought ...
why not ? sera looks just like her mom .
stop ! back up ! back up !
i &apos;m gonna kill that son of a bitch !
get him out ! get him out now .
easy !
judy was gonna leave my boy for that scumbag .
what &apos;s your name ?
what &apos;s your name ?
i &apos;m jennifer .
your turn .
my name is johnny and i need a cigarette , jennifer .
well , i might be able to help you out there .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re stressed .
oh , i &apos;m not .
i just want a smoke .
johnny , come on .
i know these teenage girls stress you out ,
no matter what you say .
i mean , how do you deal with it ?
do you like to , um ...
go out and shoot something ?
sometimes .
but i don &apos;t get much chance to do that .
oh , i thought you did have a chance recently .
i think you did .
now , you know , i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m just curious .
and then i &apos;ll go get you that cigarette .
i like you , jennifer .
so ...
you took the girls somewhere to scare them .
somewhere quiet
and isolated ...
near the water ?
i didn &apos;t do anything but scare &apos; em .
of course not .
do you have a place by the river ?
pretty and smart .
it &apos;s not my place .
it &apos;s not anybody &apos;s place anymore .
i &apos;ve taken them out there before , but this time ,
i got their attention .
sera !
sera ! sera !
sera !
sera !
sera !
sera !
here &apos;s a shotgun blast .
katie &apos;s phone . it &apos;s dead .
sera could still be out there somewhere .
we gotta keep looking .
morgan , stop , stop .
sera ?
sera , we &apos;re with the fbi .
it &apos;s ok .
put the gun down .
sera , i know you don &apos;t feel like talking ,
but if you think you can , there &apos;s some things i need to know ,
and i can &apos;t ask anyone else but you .
he killed my mother , too , didn &apos;t he ?
it &apos;s hard to say
unless we find her body .
i want to talk to him . would that be ok ?
of course .
will you come with me ?
let &apos;s get you warmed up first , ok ?
there you go .
are you a mom ?
mine used to wrap me in this quilt
that she made before i was born .
she said she always knew it would be for her little girl .
i miss her .
i &apos;m so sorry .
dad , you need help .
did i do that ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
what can i do ?
they say that if you just tell them where mom is
that this will all just be--
but i don &apos;t know . you know i don &apos;t know .
she didn &apos;t just disappear , dad .
oh , god , you killed her , didn &apos;t you ?
no . no , i didn &apos;t .
how am i supposed to believe you ?
this . this is what you &apos;ve done .
you have hurt us all for a long time .
no , don &apos;t , sera . don &apos;t go .
sera ...
the detective said my aunt was coming . which one ?
karen . she &apos;s driving in from charleston .
are you cold ?
a little bit . the thermostat &apos;s right there .
it should warm up soon .
think you &apos;ll be able to sleep ?
yeah , i want a shower first .
um , sure you &apos;re gonna be ok up there ?
yeah , i &apos;ll be fine .
um , i could make us some tea .
that &apos;d be really nice . thanks .
一切都好吗 -不确定
what &apos;s wrong ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m not sure .
she &apos;s just ... too casual
and almost cold since we got here .
it could be the shock .
i know , but she &apos;s composed at the same time .
she has not mentioned katie to me , even once , since we got here .
i couldn &apos;t walk into my house after my sister died ,
let alone walk past her room .
well , what do you think , jj , sera pulled it off ?
i certainly think it may be a possibility .
it &apos;s a very detailed plan .
what , she knew about her father &apos;s condition
and took advantage of it ?
she set up character witnesses like jeff godwin
to back up her fear .
sera !
she even got her little sister to make calls to a hotline .
he &apos;s at it again . he &apos;s just going crazy .
she manipulated us from the minute we found her .
her writing suggested no empathy
and no real emotional connection to family .
psychopathic tendencies .
her wounds are more than superficial ,
but they could be self @-@ inflicted , right , jj ?
honey , i know . mommy is sorry that she &apos;s not home tonight , ok ?
but amy &apos;s there with you
and i promise i will be home as soon as i can .
you ok ? i didn &apos;t hear the shower .
yeah . i just wanted my tea .
oh , um , i was gonna bring it to you , but it should be ready .
uh , yeah , i &apos;m still here .
we &apos;ll be right there . stay on the phone .
mommy &apos;s gotta go .
i want hotch to see the video of sera .
garcia , did you ever find out who canceled his prescription ?
uh , it turns out to cancel one of those lifelong prescriptions ,
you actually have to put it in writing ,
and according to the company records ,
it was canceled by an s. morrison .
why did you have to come down here ?
we &apos;ve been looking for that .
it &apos;s an old house . i know the best hiding places .
but you , what do you think you know ?
you put everything that went missing with your mother
inside this box .
1999 .
maybe my dad did it .
no . now , you chose this box
because it &apos;s the year katie was born
and everything changed .
she was your little sister .
katie ruined everything and my mother let her .
your mother loved you .
well , she loved katie more .
i should have cried for katie .
i guess there &apos;s some things i just can &apos;t fake .
you won &apos;t do it .
you need to back up-- now .
i can say my trauma kicked in .
ptsd .
i saw you with the gun and i didn &apos;t know what else to do .
you thought of everything .
sera , put the gun down .
no , no , you don &apos;t understand .
she has a gun . she was going to hurt me .
no . no , sera , it &apos;s ok .
listen to me .
i understand .
it &apos;s ok , sera .
she wasn &apos;t gonna hurt you .
i know . you &apos;ve been through enough .
all right ? i get it .
sera , you &apos;re safe now .
ok . thank you .
thank you .
what are you doing ? !
you &apos;re a smart girl , sera . figure it out .
no , stop it ! i swear , please !
no , i swear to you , she was trying to hurt me !
please stop . please , let me go .
let me go . no , you don &apos;t understand . please listen .
