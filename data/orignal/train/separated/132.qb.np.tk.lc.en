第七季 第十二集
it shouldn &apos;t be primarily about pro bono .
look , i &apos;m at alicia &apos;s door . i &apos;ll ask her .
alicia florrick ?
this is 603 . she &apos;s in 903 .
three floors up .
sorry .
dui .
wrong floor . up . three floors .
903 . you want 903 .
this is 603 . see ? 603 .
six . that &apos;s three numbers less than nine .
oh , hello .
do you work for mrs. florrick ?
no . although sometimes i feel like it .
this is not her law firm . this is my home .
see how pretty it is ? they rearranged the panel
on the elevator so the six is below the nine .
could you please tell your client friends to learn to read ?
are you here to see alicia florrick ?
yep .
a music case .
is this her door ?
yep .
oh , good . it &apos;s you .
dear god , what is up with that bitch downstairs ?
rowby .
i know , right ?
it &apos;s been centuries , huh ?
look at you , working from home .
you &apos;re like an artist now .
you look great .
i totally agree .
i guess that &apos;s what happens
when you start working for yourself .
i got a kid now .
little josh .
congratulations .
thanks . and , uh ...
i could use some legal help .
* good morning , magic sunshine *
* it &apos;s a brand @-@ new day *
* i see you peeking through my curtains *
* come in and stay , stay , go bananas ... *
good song , rowby .
thanks . it &apos;s my kid &apos;s birthday par ...
oh , that &apos;s him . little josh .
he &apos;s a total clown . he likes to imitate everyone .
* but then again i might *
* wake up and start my day with magic sunshine ... *
you &apos;re good , rowby .
i am good .
so what &apos;s the problem ?
i got this letter from g.f.c records .
that &apos;s your label ?
yeah . well , my former label , yeah .
they say the song &apos;s theirs ?
yeah .
that &apos;s the part i don &apos;t get . i wrote it .
i mean , i wrote that song .
ever since the whole &quot; thicky trick &quot; thing ,
i keep track of stuff .
are you still under contract with them ?
no , i finished that contract , like , last year .
so i don &apos;t understand .
have you recorded this song ?
no , i just play it
at kids &apos; birthday parties , but that video is online
and it &apos;s gone viral .
s @-@ small viral , but viral .
i &apos;ll be right back .
mrs. dosek .
mrs. florrick . i don &apos;t mean to be rude ,
but this is a residential building ,
and you &apos;re conducting business here .
yes , i &apos;ll put a sign up in the elevator , mrs. dosek .
okay , that &apos;s not gonna make a difference .
here . your daughter &apos;s report card .
it &apos;s open .
yes . i thought it was addressed to me .
she got two bs and three cs .
it &apos;s weird . i went to the wrong floor .
i think it &apos;s the way they changed the numbers in the elevator .
i &apos;ll make it all good , mrs. dosek .
thank you . good @-@ bye . cary ?
so , am i late ?
for ?
for rowby .
his new song .
how did you know ?
he came by lockhart / agos .
i suggested it might be more up your alley ,
but he wanted both of us .
cary , it &apos;s a kids &apos; song .
yeah , with over a million views on youtube
and with other labels wanting to buy it .
sorry i &apos;m late .
i just came from a nasty encounter ,
so i might have some wine .
that sounds good . uh , what encounter ?
oh , just some woman yelled at me .
so how &apos;s the job search going ?
it &apos;s good , actually .
in fact , i wanted to thank you for offering to advise ,
but i got a job .
really ? fantastic . where ?
uh , oddly , at the firm i was complaining about .
lockhart / agos / lee .
i just left there a month ago .
why &apos;d you leave ?
oh , the next shiny thing .
alicia florrick . now i &apos;m not sure .
that &apos;s where i just got yelled at .
really ?
she said that ?
yes .
so she might come back ?
she didn &apos;t say that .
she just said she wasn &apos;t thrilled to be going to a law firm
in someone &apos;s apartment .
you have to apologize .
for what ?
for arguing a pro @-@ life position .
i wasn &apos;t arguing a pro @-@ life position .
diane , no one can understand what you were doing .
if saying &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; gets us back in the door
of a $ 4 @-@ million @-@ a @-@ year client , why wouldn &apos;t you ?
because i &apos;m not sorry .
do you want me to step out ?
no . will she meet with us ? yes .
i don &apos;t know . i was speaking highly of you .
how diverse you are here .
we should bring the cripple to the next meeting .
oh , my god .
what ? the lawyer in the wheelchair .
i know what you &apos;re saying .
will you call her ?
it &apos;s not really my account .
get her back in the door , and we &apos;ll talk .
well , look who &apos;s here to survey the spoils .
just seeing how you &apos;re doing .
our polling was off .
i know .
way off .
was that you , too ?
no .
i really thought we were gonna go on to new hampshire .
i know .
peter did , too .
but you didn &apos;t ?
you had me tempted .
your optimism was infectious .
well ...
you going on to sanders ?
no .
congressional races . they &apos;re more fun .
you staying ?
yeah . peter &apos;s got to get back into governing .
well , i have some advice for you , if you don &apos;t mind .
i &apos;d never mind .
peter &apos;s in trouble .
i don &apos;t know from where , i don &apos;t know who .
but a governor who returns home after a loss
has a target on his back .
someone &apos;s gonna take a shot at him .
who ?
i don &apos;t know .
watch out for friends .
and on that sinister note ,
good @-@ bye , eli .
good @-@ bye , ruth .
i wish ...
i had been better to you .
i wish you had been , too .
who are you ?
uh , lucca quinn . i work with alicia .
doing what ?
lawyering .
are you rowby ?
yeah .
i have to tell you something .
i think i love you .
no , i &apos;m not kidding .
like , i &apos;m serious . like , i ... it &apos;s crazy .
do you always decide things this fast ?
uh ... yeah .
hey , can ... can i play some music for you ?
&apos;cause i think that &apos;s the only chance i got .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
we &apos;re about to start negotiations .
you want to sit down ?
yeah .
um ... seriously , though , can i just say that ,
like , i ... i never do this .
but you ... are the most beautiful human being
i have ever seen , like , in my life .
thank you .
it &apos;s crazy .
i think we have company .
oh , hello .
we &apos;re back facing each other .
andrea stevens .
and you have some beautiful name , don &apos;t you ?
lucca quinn .
lucca .
yes .
and you &apos;ve done something different with your hair ,
haven &apos;t you ?
no .
yes . yes , in the front , the bangs .
i love it .
should i just give you guys some space ?
rowby canton , always fun to hear from the artist .
i &apos;m just gonna set myself up right over here , all right ?
okay .
good morning , everyone .
um , i just want to say that my client , damon ,
has great respect for your talent , rowby .
is that why he cut me loose ?
i cut you loose because ...
i don &apos;t think we need to go over the gory details .
we respect you , rowby ,
and that &apos;s why we sent you
a cease and desist letter .
your youtube video must come down ,
and we ask that you no longer record the song
&quot; good morning magic sunshine &quot;
until you acquire our permission .
our client appreciates all your respect , andrea ,
um , but we respectfully reject your cease and desist .
our client is the sole owner of the song he composed .
unfortunately , that isn &apos;t true .
as you can see from this contract ,
rowby owes us another album .
but i signed a two @-@ album deal ,
and i gave you two albums .
i rejected the second one .
damon . one sec .
mr. stryk wants our artists to be happy ,
so he &apos;ll offer , uh ... $ 1,500
for rowby to record a studio version .
$ 1,500 ? seriously ?
seriously .
oh , i would rather keep playing birthday parties .
and you know what ? you &apos;re very good .
i have a daughter of my own .
adopted from china last year .
and she loves it .
but , again , it &apos;s our song .
and we have to warn you , rowby ,
that , um , we &apos;ll be pulling your video off @-@ line .
no , you won &apos;t . you can &apos;t do that .
yeah , actually , i just did .
can she do that ?
if we assert a copyright interest ,
we can unilaterally remove infringing videos .
you can &apos;t assert a copyright ...
thank you , bea ,
for giving us a second chance .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing .
but i am here to listen .
david lee . i hope you remember me .
i &apos;m a real fan of yours .
i told diane and david
that you might be having some difficulty
with the lack of infrastructure at florrick / quinn .
yes .
but i &apos;m not sure if i &apos;m ready to come back here .
well , we would love to tell you ...
&quot; how &quot; ?
yes , why don &apos;t you come into diane &apos;s office ,
yes , good idea .
and we can talk ?
i have a call to make first .
in the office ! just ... just right here .
... happy with that .
what &apos;s wrong ? what are they doing here ?
g.f.c records ?
no , alicia and her partner .
i told you . we &apos;re on this case together .
are you trying to sabotage us ?
not in our conference room , cary .
we have bea wilson here .
she &apos;s thinking of leaving them .
i didn &apos;t know that .
well , get them out of here .
all right , all right ! excuse me .
thank you for your attention , everyone . damon ?
look , we really wanted to settle this here ,
but you &apos;ve given us no choice .
we are suing your client .
for what ?
breach of contract . $ 3.1 million in damages .
three point what ?
look at your contract , buddy .
what part of my contract ?
it &apos;s their costs .
costs ? oh , oh , it &apos;s $ 3.1 million in costs ?
promotional , touring ...
they didn &apos;t promote my album .
... cd packaging and breakage .
almost everything was online .
i mean , i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t remember
negotiating any of this stuff .
you probably didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s all pretty boiler @-@ plate .
it &apos;s designed to maximize their profits ,
keep their artists indebted .
well , it &apos;s working .
now what ? i mean , i @-@ i can &apos;t afford $ 3.1 million .
it &apos;s ridiculous .
can you guys represent me ?
well , we would have to talk about our fee .
well , what if ... what if i just paid you back
with a percentage of the song ?
if you get it back .
&quot; if &quot; ?
it &apos;s not about us .
it &apos;s about work .
i &apos;m working as the chief of staff for peter now--again--
and i wanted to talk to you about the future .
potential political problems .
not just ...
hi , mrs. dosek . how are you ?
fine . can you give this to your mother ?
uh , yes . what is it ?
it &apos;s from the homeowners &apos; association . it &apos;s an eviction notice .
excuse me ?
your mother is running a business out of her home .
no , she isn &apos;t .
you know , just tell ... you tell them
that i &apos;ll see &apos; em in court .
excuse me .
that &apos;s just a friend of the family .
your mother has one week to respond
before we commence eviction proceedings .
i like this office . why are you leaving it ?
come on , i need the chair .
no , i think you should stay here .
it keeps you humble .
come on , i don &apos;t have time to play .
wow , you &apos;re sour .
see ? it &apos;s so impersonal in here .
if you want the small office , you can take it .
really ?
really ? i should take the small office ?
i can have the job ?
what job ?
the job you &apos;re offering me .
i am not offering you a job .
there is no job . can you see i &apos;m busy ?
dad , i need a job . i need to finance my art .
what art ?
the art of living . come on .
i can &apos;t help you . ask someone else .
ask alicia .
yeah , alicia . she probably needs someone .
her firm just took on a lot of clients .
it &apos;s not a bad idea .
odd .
you know , you &apos;re not as fun as you used to be , dad ,
something &apos;s off with you .
it &apos;s called fatherhood .
the fact of the matter is that
rowby canton isn &apos;t a freedom fighter .
he &apos;s a man under contract
who wishes he weren &apos;t .
but mr. canton says
he delivered you a second album , didn &apos;t he ?
yes , but what he delivered was ...
unacceptable .
can i say something ? because that is ...
really offensive .
no . unfortunately not , mr. canton .
point of personal privilege .
yes . i &apos;m guessing that you saw that in a movie , sir .
that doesn &apos;t work here .
please continue .
thank you , your honor .
mr. stryk .
there were no crowd @-@ pleasers , there were no hooks ,
there was nothing i could even repackage to any other artist .
i already reposted it .
how did you do that ?
i thought they had it excluded .
mirror @-@ reversed it .
the classic way to get around their detection software .
how long before you think they figure it out ?
i have produced
over 200 of them .
and what mr. canton handed me was ... not a hit .
your honor , i know it &apos;s hard for artists like rowby ,
who tend to work from an emotional place ,
to understand all the ins and outs ...
objection , your honor .
counsel is testifying .
no , i &apos;m just trying to be compassionate , but ...
i &apos;ll hold my tongue .
i seem to have touched on a sensitive area .
mr. stryk .
you keep talking about hit records ,
but rowby wasn &apos;t contractually obligated to deliver a hit album .
that &apos;s true .
he was obligated to deliver an album
that was &quot; substantially similar
in quality and genre to artist &apos;s initial album . &quot;
is that true , too ?
it is .
no further questions , your honor .
ms. stevens , anything ?
yes . thank you , your honor .
was mr. canton &apos;s second album
&quot; substantially similar in quality and genre &quot; to his first ?
no , it was not .
why not ?
because his first album wasn &apos;t substantially bad .
objection . prejudicial .
sustained .
yeah . sustained .
mr. canton , i &apos;m extending you a little rope
because i find you entertaining .
don &apos;t push it .
i &apos;m sorry , your honor .
andrea , the video &apos;s back up .
wow , you have a bitch of a neighbor downstairs .
yeah , i know . she &apos;s not happy with us .
may i help you ?
marissa .
remember ? eli &apos;s funny daughter .
i &apos;m here to see your mom .
oh , she &apos;ll be back from court in , like , a minute .
can i wait ?
oh , and the bitch gave me this .
she &apos;s trying to evict us .
homeowners &apos; association ?
yeah .
we &apos;re not supposed to have a home office .
does anybody have a home office ?
in the building ?
yeah , i think so . why ?
you should check .
all these homeowners &apos; association people think
they &apos;re above the law .
usually they &apos;re just as corrupt .
how do i check ?
sit down in the lobby .
wait for a ups man or a fedex man to come ,
then follow him up to the floor .
whoever gets the most packages , they have the home offices .
i know . it &apos;s my dad &apos;s genes .
very sneaky .
hey , mom , we &apos;re in here .
marissa , hi .
hi .
i &apos;m back in your life again .
so where were you ? were you back in israel ?
no , san francisco .
no reason . someone bet me .
i need a job .
okay .
and i wanted to give you first shot at hiring me .
thank you , uh , but i don &apos;t need anyone now .
dad said you were taking on all these new clients .
eli told you that ?
yeah . he said you might need someone .
no , i &apos;m good .
okay . will you keep me in mind if things change ?
sure , but i don &apos;t think they will .
okay .
is everything all right ?
yes . i just don &apos;t ...
tell eli to stop it .
stop what ?
marissa , visit me because you want to ,
not because your dad wants you to .
i did because i wanted to .
well , i have to get back to court .
good seeing you again , marissa .
same here .
morris weiner ,
phd . i hold the pederson chair
of musicology at bridgeton .
doctor , what is pop music ?
a genre of popular music
based in rock and roll of the &apos; 50s and &apos; 60s .
and how would you recognize a pop song ?
through its hooks .
pop songs are all full of hooks .
there &apos;s one in the intro ,
another in the chorus ,
there &apos;s another in the bridge .
and what do you mean by &quot; hook &quot; ?
it &apos;s a short , catchy , repeated riff .
it &apos;s an earworm .
and that &apos;s all there is to it ? the hooks ?
no , uh , pop songs also tend to be nonharmonic
with pronounced timbrel dissonance .
four @-@ bar phrasing , a beat @-@ per @-@ minute range
between 72 and 85 .
so you &apos;re saying that rowby canton &apos;s
new album didn &apos;t have most of these hallmarks ?
i &apos;m saying it had none of them . listen .
* i saw a light i &apos;d never seen before *
yes , yes , you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s not as catchy , is it ?
i keep trying to tap my foot , but ...
this was not substantially similar to his first album .
thank you . no further questions .
&quot; bohemian rhapsody . &quot;
the song by queen . you &apos;re familiar with it ?
of course .
and you call that good ?
right ? a pop hit ?
well ...
i would .
well , yeah , it @-@ it is . it &apos;s a pop hit .
could you point out where the hooks are ?
well , you know , not all pop songs are identical .
oh . well , can i read back your testimony from a few minutes ago ?
&quot; pop songs are all full of hooks . &quot;
oh , lucca , i love you .
would you like to correct your testimony , sir ?
not all pop songs are identical . most are identical .
yeah ...
uh , sorry . i @-@ i don &apos;t think we caught that .
right into your microphone there .
yes , not all pop songs .
and could you tell us where the four @-@ bar phrases are
and the chorus and the verse ?
well , that &apos;s difficult to distinguish .
and the 72 to 85 beats @-@ per @-@ minute range-- where &apos;s that ?
yeah , but again , &quot; bohemian rhapsody &quot; is an unusual case .
as is rowby &apos;s song . thank you .
mm . that last little bit wasn &apos;t really a question , was it ?
yeah , let me see if i can confine
my redirect to questions .
mr. canton &apos;s contract said
&quot; substantially similar in quality and genre . &quot;
what genre was his first album ?
as i &apos;ve said , it was pop .
and ...
what is ... this ?
* i saw the light ... *
it @-@ it &apos;s not pop .
thank you . and i love &quot; bohemian rhapsody , &quot; too .
kermit corriel .
i taught music at juilliard .
you also have a doctorate in musicology from juilliard ?
well , yeah , but who goes around advertising that ?
this guy is awesome .
would you agree that rowby &apos;s second album
is not in the same pop genre as his first album ?
i don &apos;t think i &apos;d agree with any part of that .
his first album wasn &apos;t exactly 100 % pop .
and i don &apos;t think his second album &apos;s all that different .
can you explain ?
well , yeah , i mean , genres aren &apos;t fixed , right ?
they ebb and flow over time .
and then there &apos;s this give and take between genres .
like , rowby &apos;s first album was pop ,
but it also had country and folk tendencies , too .
and his second album ?
well , that pushes deeper into country .
you can hear that in the intro .
and then it pushes further into folk
with the verse , and then in the chorus ,
i mean , look , it &apos;s pretty clear that it &apos;s indie pop .
so , is this the same or different than &quot; thicky trick &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know ... it @-@ it @-@ it &apos;s both , man .
rowby &apos;s an artist .
he &apos;s exploring .
both those songs are written by the same person ,
but they &apos;re not identical .
and no album should be identical .
like picasso , right ? you see him going through
his blue period or his crystal period .
thank you .
okay , this is all fascinating ,
but there &apos;s nothing that i &apos;ve heard
that convinces me that there &apos;s anything close
to objective truth here , so i have to defer
to the good faith efforts
made by mr. canton to fulfill his contract .
yes , your honor , you ...
are awesome , thank you .
your honor , uh , we seek lead to argue
that the song was written during the term of his contract .
what ?
you do ?
then why did we go through this exercise ?
i &apos;m so sorry , your honor ,
but this was just brought to our attention .
this is another video that mr. canton
posted online .
* good morning , magic sunshine *
* it &apos;s a brand @-@ new day ... *
very nice .
what am i looking for ?
the time code stamp .
chummyvideo stamps the posting time of all videos .
see , this video was posted at 11 : 42 pm. on november 30 .
rowby canton &apos;s contract didn &apos;t expire
until midnight on that date , your honor .
therefore , he wrote the song while still under contract .
what &apos;s going on with you and alicia ?
nothing .
can we not do this now ?
no , we &apos;re doing this now , dad .
you got mom pregnant , so we &apos;re doing this now .
what did alicia say ?
she said , &quot; tell eli to stop it . &quot;
stop what ?
that &apos;s what i asked . she didn &apos;t say .
she made it sound like she didn &apos;t have to say .
alicia and i are having some ... issues .
are you sleeping with her ?
oh , my god , no !
no .
are you wanting to ?
what ? no .
it &apos;s nothing like that .
then what is it ?
six years ago , alicia got a voice mail
from ... a friend ,
someone who was in love with her .
will ?
yes . how do you know that ?
i have eyes .
and he said that he loved her ,
and i was worried about alicia getting this voice mail
in the middle of a campaign , so ...
i erased it .
and i felt bad about it , and so i told her .
when ?
a week ago .
and that &apos;s it .
so he called her and said , &quot; i love you , &quot; and you erased it ?
and now will &apos;s gone , and it &apos;s something
she can never make right .
yes .
i &apos;m not proud of it .
that &apos;s why i told her .
god , it &apos;s like a soap opera here when i &apos;m gone .
and now she &apos;s gonna think i &apos;m trying to get back
into her good graces by sending you over there .
she won &apos;t talk to you ?
no .
you think that &apos;ll change ?
no .
have you tried ...
yes , yes .
everything .
what are you doing ?
i don &apos;t know . i have to think about it .
just @-@ just don &apos;t do anything , okay ?
this is my thing .
all right . bye .
you &apos;re gonna do something , aren &apos;t you ? marissa .
andrea stevens
has subpoenaed your computer and your phone ,
so we need to know :
did you write &quot; good morning magic sunshine &quot;
while you were under contract for g.f.c ?
no .
chummyvideo time @-@ stamps every posting ,
and we &apos;ve confirmed you posted the song
11 : 42 pm on the 30th ,
which means the contract was still valid .
wait .
where is chummyvideo centered ?
what do you mean ?
well , it &apos;s california ,
right ? it &apos;s a california company .
that &apos;s right . that &apos;s right .
lucca , that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s totally right !
are you saying the time zone made a difference ?
yes , i posted the video
11 : 42 pm .
pacific time , which means ...
1 : 42 a.m. chicago time .
yeah , which means the contract &apos;s expired .
yeah , but you wrote the song in that short of a time ?
yes , that &apos;s how all of my songs come .
trust me when i say i know when the damn contract ended .
and the minute the clock struck midnight , i celebrated .
i had people over to my house .
unfortunately , i woke up my son ,
and i tried to get him to go back to sleep ,
and when it didn &apos;t work ,
i wrote &quot; good morning magic sunshine . &quot;
you improvised it on video ?
yeah , it &apos;s pretty cool , right ?
i keep telling you guys ,
it &apos;s just a song i wrote for my kid .
i would really like to buy you a drink .
why ?
because you are awesome .
how long have you been married , rowby ?
i &apos;ve never been married .
i wrote you a song .
so who was holding the camera ?
what camera ?
when you were playing for your son ?
you were playing the guitar , your son was in bed ,
and someone was holding the camera .
who was that ?
we &apos;re divorced .
she wanted a two @-@ car garage ,
and ... i couldn &apos;t give it to her .
true story .
you &apos;re like a bond girl .
i like artists ,
but i lose interest in them real quick .
you want to go home ?
sure . i have a babysitter .
is your home an artist &apos;s hovel ?
yes , but tomorrow &apos;s cleaning day .
my apartment .
just for an hour .
then you &apos;ll go home .
i proise .
it was just , like ... boom !
it wasn &apos;t there , and then all of a sudden , it was there .
it was , uh , like , this @-@ this , um , like , creative orgasm .
like a burst of creativity .
yes , like a ... yes .
and i just , i sat there ,
and i just watched the clock
until my contract expired ,
and then i was like , bang , bang , bang , bang , bang , bang .
and i wrote , like , eight songs , one after another , like , boom .
and is that common to be able to generate a good ,
quality song in such a short amount of time ?
the song &quot; yesterday , &quot; mccartney woke up
with that in his head .
thank you . mr. canton , do you mind if i ask ,
how long did it take you to write
the eight songs for your second album ?
i don &apos;t know . years ?
two years , actually .
so it took two years for eight songs ,
and then , let &apos;s see , two hours for the next eight ?
i was just under a lot of pressure to write the first eight songs .
my goodness , that must be quite a bit of pressure for you .
objection , your honor .
i withdraw that . it &apos;s not a big point .
so can you help me understand
this note you left on your subpoenaed smartphone ?
it &apos;s a lyric from &quot; good morning magic sunshine . &quot;
it says , &quot; make me warm and toasty
while i lay here warm and cozy , &quot;
and it &apos;s dated 23 days before the end of your record contract .
uh , i wrote that down , but that &apos;s not a lyric .
i &apos;m pretty sure it is .
no , it ended up as a lyric .
it &apos;s just , it &apos;s something that my son said .
like , he said something totally cute and awesome ,
and i wrote it down .
which , according to the terms of your deal with g.f.c records ,
constitutes work product
created within the term of your contract .
you &apos;re claiming that you own the copyright to that line ?
absolutely .
that &apos;s absurd on its face .
they don &apos;t own everything his kid says
just because he wrote it down .
i didn &apos;t say &quot; everything . &quot;
well , that &apos;s ... are you seriously ... ?
i mean , his son ... his son ...
his son , your honor ,
his son , josh &apos;s quote was not work product .
your honor , it was inspiration .
&quot; inspiration &quot; isn &apos;t a legal term .
it &apos;s an artistic conceit .
because rowby is an artist .
an artist under contract .
but rowby &apos;s contract does not negate the creative process .
he wrote something down that was meaningful to him ,
not knowing it would make its way into a song .
but it did , quite directly .
josh &apos;s quote was the first step in a songwriting process
that mr. canton began while still under a deal with g.f.c.
think about what she &apos;s saying , your honor .
a.a. milne based christopher robin on his son ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean
he started writing winnie @-@ the @-@ pooh
the day he became a father .
bob dylan didn &apos;t start writing
&quot; tangled up in blue &quot;
on the day of his marriage even though that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
those were general inspirations ;
this is a specific line .
no , it became a specific line .
moreover , the existence of this note undercuts
mr. canton &apos;s claim that he wrote
&quot; good morning magic sunshine &quot; in less than a day .
the act of observing the world is not the same as composing .
enough , please .
um , your cynicism is , i &apos;m sure , warranted ,
given your business , miss stevens ,
but i @-@ i must agree with the defendant here .
observing the world is not the same as composing .
i don &apos;t think any of us want to slide down that slippery slope .
case dismissed .
did we ... did we just win ?
you won .
we won ? !
yes .
we did it .
and i &apos;m constantly signing for her packages ,
and not for her personally ; for her business .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry , but i understood
that mrs. florrick would be present for today &apos;s meeting .
uh , mrs. florrick is otherwise disposed at the moment ,
but as an employee of florrick / quinn ,
i can answer any questions you might have .
aren &apos;t you her daughter ?
yes . i &apos;m also an employee .
oh , so you admit
that she is running a business from her apartment .
yes .
well , that &apos;s against hoa regulations .
is it ?
yes , it is . now ...
well , then why isn &apos;t mr. tipton being questioned ?
i don &apos;t follow .
mr. graham tipton .
he runs a business out of his apartment on the sixth floor .
why isn &apos;t he ... ?
i do not .
well , you &apos;re a day trader , aren &apos;t you ?
you work out of your apartment ?
i work from home .
that &apos;s different than running a business out of my apartment .
but your loan @-@ out company ,
graham is awesome , inc . ,
lists this building as its address ,
and your business receives its mail here .
are you always available to sign for it ?
no , but ...
okay , look , we are not on trial here .
the regulations also prohibit subletting ,
but mrs. dosek rents a spare bedroom
in her apartment to her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
well , that &apos;s my mother @-@ in @-@ law . there &apos;s an exemption for family .
actually , there isn &apos;t .
then there &apos;s mr. loring on the eighth floor ,
who frequently hosts high @-@ priced call girls .
okay , okay , maybe we should just
table this discussion for the moment .
i think that &apos;d be good .
my mother &apos;s a great lawyer .
she usually stands up well for herself .
* cause i don &apos;t want to look back and wonder *
* what if i &apos;d called your name *
* so won &apos;t you tell me , lucca ... *
oh , no .
i &apos;m singing my heart out .
how can you answer a text ?
you &apos;re being sued .
again ?
the label is suing you for copyright infringement .
of what ?
another kids &apos; song they own .
&quot; moony moonikins . &quot;
$ 2.8 million in damages .
my god .
the law just gives so many people ways to be mean .
you gonna protect me ?
doing my best .
so let &apos;s talk about &quot; moony moonikins . &quot; you &apos;ve heard it ?
oh , yeah , of course .
you &apos;ve even played it in your children &apos;s sets .
i usually open my sets with it .
it &apos;s , like , every kid &apos;s favorite song .
yeah , my adopted daughter from china , she just adores it .
uh , tell me , how did this work ?
did you just decide to change it a bit
and then put your name on it , or ... ?
no , look , if there &apos;s any similarities
between the two songs , it &apos;s &apos; cause they &apos;re both kids songs .
you know , when you &apos;re working with kids
with a shorter attention span ,
and there &apos;s no sex , drugs , and rock and roll ,
you &apos;re somewhat narrowing your sandbox .
yet other people have managed to do that
and not plagiarize , so ...
objection .
sustained .
think i made my point , your honor .
your witness .
rowby ,
can you show us how you composed &quot; good morning magic sunshine &quot; ?
objection , your honor .
no , i &apos;d like to see this .
uh , so this is superscribe .
i play notes on the keyboard , and then they just populate
into sheet music in real time .
uh , could you please , uh , play a little
of &quot; good morning magic sunshine &quot; ?
sure .
acoustics are actually pretty good in here .
you guys should rent it out for gigs .
thank you .
now can you play &quot; moony moonikins &quot; ?
yeah .
it &apos;s catchy , right ?
does no one have kids ?
guilty . adopted daughter from china .
could you please superimpose the two songs you just played ?
if they &apos;re similar , they should overlap .
as you can see , your honor ,
these two songs are nothing alike .
objection , your honor , he just left out the performance elements--
the kazoo , the squeaky toy , the xylophone ,
the shakers , the clapping ...
because none of that is legally copyrightable .
with music , what you can copyright
is the actual sound recording or the composition .
any similarities here are the kind that are not legally protected .
what do you say to that , ms. stevens ?
take this four @-@ note run from &quot; magic sunshine . &quot;
and this four @-@ note run from &quot; moony . &quot;
now look .
they &apos;re virtually identical .
so you see major similarities .
micro @-@ segments are exactly the same .
thank you .
if you looked at micro @-@ segments
in a lot of children &apos;s songs ,
wouldn &apos;t there be many major similarities ?
no .
for example ,
isn &apos;t the theme from spongebob squarepants
similar to the sea chantey &quot; blow the man down &quot; ?
i @-@ i &apos;m not familiar with the theme song you &apos;re talking about .
what about the opening percussion riffs
in the supremes &apos; version of &quot; you can &apos;t hurry love &quot;
and iggy pop &apos;s &quot; lust for life &quot; ? aren &apos;t they identical ?
you know , i ... i &apos;m not prepared to say that .
well , what about the chorus riff in boston &apos;s &quot; more than a feeling &quot;
and &quot; louie louie &quot; by the kingsmen ?
objection , your honor . this is not name that tune .
this is getting a bit ridiculous .
and that &apos;s our point .
when you break a song down into small enough components ,
you &apos;ll always find similarities .
don &apos;t break them down , then , your honor .
just listen to them together .
okay , okay , i &apos;ve heard enough .
i will take this under advisement .
we &apos;ll reconvene for my decision this afternoon .
i found myself wrong about this firm ,
so i gave it a second chance .
she gave me a second chance .
you say bea wilson is returning ?
yes .
uh , she &apos;s thinking of returning .
she wasn &apos;t thrilled with having
a law firm that works out of an apartment building .
my god .
there &apos;s this horrible woman there .
yes ,
alicia can be quite trying .
i don &apos;t think she means ...
let me just close this .
you know this could go either way , right ?
let &apos;s settle .
what have you got ?
we can &apos;t break our contracts .
it would set a bad precedent ,
but we could give rowby a few points .
a few ? seriously ?
where &apos;s rowby ?
maybe he should hear this .
we &apos;re late .
it &apos;s okay .
they can &apos;t start without us .
ms. dunne ?
how are you ?
good . just going .
i see that .
you &apos;re dropping by the office tomorrow , right ?
right .
you okay ?
that &apos;s one of our new clients .
so ?
what &apos;s she doing here ?
they &apos;re stealing our clients .
you should &apos;ve seen her .
she looked so guilty .
yes , alicia florrick for lila dunne , please .
i see .
when will she be back in ?
they screwed us .
thank you .
who else could they be going after ?
we haven &apos;t seen bea wilson in a while .
she was supposed to call yesterday .
that would be bad .
and cary .
cary &apos;s been screwing us the whole time .
alicia florrick .
okay . we &apos;re on our way .
judge page , she &apos;s made a decision .
you go .
i &apos;m gonna stay here and call our clients .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
hey , man .
andrea has another offer .
go to hell .
excuse me ?
all rise .
* good morning , magic sunshine *
* it &apos;s a brand @-@ new day ... *
she likes it . she likes me .
okay , this is what i know .
&quot; good morning , magic sunshine &quot; is a good song .
and i don &apos;t even have kids .
but when you start to chop it up ,
deconstruct it , you stop hearing it .
and that &apos;s not how you &apos;re supposed to listen to music .
when i &apos;m just experiencing these songs
and not analyzing them ,
they sound the same .
they simply have too much in common
for this to be a coincidence .
so ...
based on the evidence presented ,
i concluded , mr. canton ,
you stole that song .
summary judgment for the plaintiff .
but , bea , just give us a chance .
the advantage to working with a small firm is dedication .
we don &apos;t split our duties .
okay . i &apos;ll await your call .
can i help , mom ?
make any calls ?
no , i &apos;m good .
no , seriously ,
i &apos;m done with all my homework .
okay , then we should talk .
is it one of those talks ?
yes . i &apos;m afraid it is .
you know how much i love you , right ?
and how much i appreciate
everything you &apos;re doing here ,
for the firm , for me .
mom , if it &apos;s about my grades , i can bring them up .
i promise you .
you need to stop working at florrick &amp; quinn .
you &apos;re firing me ?
yes , i am .
but that &apos;s not fair .
i &apos;ve been doing such a good job .
yes , you have .
you have been doing an amazing job .
too amazing , in fact .
so you &apos;re firing me for doing too good a job ?
that has to be illegal .
grace ,
you need to start focusing on your future , not mine .
mom , you need me .
yes , as a daughter ,
i so , so do .
but as a mother--
as your mother--
i need to be taking care of you ,
not the reverse .
do you understand what i &apos;m saying ?
i understand .
you want me to butt out of your life .
no .
my business .
mom , you can &apos;t fire me and hug me at the same time .
oh , yes , i can .
are you sad ?
well , kind of .
i don &apos;t like losing .
yeah , me neither .
* &apos; cause , lucca *
* when you &apos;re near me *
* all is plain to see *
* that , lucca *
* all that matters *
* is you with me *
that &apos;s wonderful .
thanks .
sell it .
to who ?
to anyone .
yeah ?
change the name , though .
whoa , where you going ?
back to real life .
what was this ?
so , you screwed us .
you mean did we try to poach the clients you poached from us ?
did you ?
yes .
great . congratulations .
they said no .
we can &apos;t get ahold of our clients .
yeah , because they &apos;re saying no to you , too .
what does that mean ?
they want you as lawyers ,
but they want our infrastructure .
and if they can &apos;t have both ,
they &apos;re gonna keep looking .
how do you know that ?
they said it .
so why are you here ?
come back to lockhart &amp; agos .
no .
why not ?
you fired me .
and i &apos;ve never worked there .
we want you back .
and we want you to come with her .
diane does ?
well , she understands the situation .
thank you , but i &apos;m not interested .
if you change your mind ...
i won &apos;t . thank you .
bye .
shall we at least discuss this ?
okay .
we &apos;re working out of your apartment .
we still have 70 % duis .
we &apos;re barely making ends meet .
and we may have just lost our top four clients .
and we don &apos;t have to answer to anyone .
because no one else wants us .
do you want to go and work for a big firm ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe .
well , i can &apos;t .
so what do we do ?
oh , dear god .
you have to forgive my dad .
marissa .
i &apos;m not here for him . i &apos;m here for me .
hi .
hi . i &apos;ll leave you to it .
did i interrupt something ?
yes .
my dad cares about you , alicia .
he only confessed to you what he did
because he was torn up about it .
he never had to confess .
you wouldn &apos;t have known .
no one would &apos;ve known .
but he cares about you .
and my dad doesn &apos;t care about many people .
yes , he did wrong , but let him apologize .
let him ...
what ?
you &apos;re looking at me like you want to tell me something .
get lost ? go to hell ?
no .
then what ?
i hurt .
i &apos;m sorry .
it hurt me .
he knows that .
then he can &apos;t expect anything more of me .
it would be unfair for him to expect anything more .
then let me say something .
something very small .
call him up and say , &quot; you &apos;re forgiven .
&quot; i need some time to not deal with you ,
「 but you &apos;re forgiven . &quot;
i can &apos;t .
please ?
marissa , i ...
no .
