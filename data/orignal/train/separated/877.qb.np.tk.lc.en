growing up , my mom was many things ,
but cool was definitely not one of them .
she would seriously leave the house like that .
you &apos;re not seriously gonna leave the house like that , are you ?
of course not .
she was an absolute stickler for her uncool rules ...
curfew is 11 : 00 .
it &apos;s 11 : 04 .
even the way she worried about us was uncool .
do you know what could happen in four minutes ?
you could drown , choke , eat poison berries .
and if any of that happens , then i have failed as a mother .
but the most uncool thing of all
was how much our mom loved us .
i made these people -- me .
i made them with my body .
there &apos;s this one now .
hey , erica , it &apos;s your mom .
erica , it &apos;s your mother !
hi , erica and erica &apos;s friends !
oh , my god . mom , what are you wearing ?
isn &apos;t this adorable ?
that kiosk uses technology to put memories on a t @-@ shirt .
it &apos;s totally cool .
oh , jill , look . there &apos;s your mom , too . louise !
louise rubin -- the cool mom .
there &apos;s always one -- hip youthful ,
and wouldn &apos;t be caught dead in a shirt with her kids &apos; faces on it .
yep , she was the anti @-@ beverly .
oh , look what you &apos;ve got on .
what are the chances , huh ?
are you here to celebrate choctoberfest at the fudge emporium , too ?
nope . just hanging with the girls .
which girls ?
these girls . we just did our nails .
so , you drove them here and had to wait in the car
while they enjoyed themselves , huh ?
mom , she &apos;s hanging with us , okay ?
we &apos;re here to get the new madonna album .
don &apos;t you just love -- - wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
when you said you were going to the mall with your friend louise ,
i thought that meant a girl from your class ,
not mrs. rubin .
ugh , i don &apos;t want them to call me that .
it makes me feel like such a mom , you know ?
ohh , pfft . yeah .
that &apos;s why i like erica &apos;s friends to call me bev .
sounds good , bev .
don &apos;t like it . go back .
okay , this was fun . see you at dinner ?
yep . got to fix some din @-@ din .
chicken &apos;s not gonna pot @-@ pie itself ,
know what i &apos;m sayin &apos; ?
cool . nice catching up , bev .
okay , see you on the fliflop !
the nerve of that woman ,
cold chillin &apos; with my daughter at the mall .
erica should be cold chillin &apos; with me , not her !
what are you talking about ?
you cold chill with erica all the time .
no .
i only feed her soup when she &apos;s sick
and give her boric @-@ acid drops when she &apos;s got pinkeye .
i &apos;m in the trenches doing the important , boring stuff .
but when it comes time for fun ,
well , she heads straight to louise rubin .
wait . we &apos;re talking about louise rubin here ?
oh , she &apos;s the coolest .
what ?
yeah !
she &apos;ll cut the top off her shirt
just to show her shoulder .
well , i can do that .
see ? i &apos;m just as cool as the next mom .
w @-@ what are you doing ?
i &apos;m trying to expose my shoulder !
poop . i just stretched it out .
stop stretching your sweater .
okay .
stop !
well , i got to stretch my sweater out
so i can show my shoulder .
why won &apos;t you stop ? !
i don &apos;t know why you can &apos;t stop , but you need to stop !
it was october 22 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and i was spending the night with my apple ii plus .
it had a whopping 16k of ram ,
dot matrix printer , 32 @-@ bit color graphics ,
and badass , thrill @-@ a @-@ minute video games
like &quot; oregon trail . &quot;
balls !
while i spent time with my computer ,
barry was hanging with his new crew of dudes .
they called themselves the &quot; jenkin town posse ... &quot;
jtp ! jtp !
... jtp for short .
they were older , cooler , and lived on the edge .
there was jeff schwartz , the madman ....
potato chips on a sandwich ? i &apos;m crazy !
... andy cogan , the ladies man
who never let his height get in the way .
can a brother get a steppin &apos; stool ?
... and &quot; naked rob , &quot;
one of those dudes who loved getting nude .
this tank top &apos;s chafing me . i got to take it off .
don &apos;t ! come on .
yo . what you wild cats up to tonight ?
whatever it is , you know it &apos;ll involve some ladies !
how many ladies ?
so many it &apos;s gonna be crazy !
oh , man . how crazy ?
so crazy someone may get in @-@ jured !
yo , baby ! it &apos;s on , baby !

you know how our school &apos;s always trying
to get their hands on germantown high mascot ?

w @-@ well , i mean , not yet .
but once we do it , we &apos;ll be kings of the school .
jtp ! jtp !
jtp ! jtp !
jtp !
dude ...
you can &apos;t say &quot; jtp &quot; unless you &apos;re in the jtp .
a man could only dream .
jtp out !
to the jtp , i was just a nerd obsessed with computers .
that all changed the day &quot; porky &apos;s ii &quot; was sold out
and they were forced to see &quot; wargames , &quot;
a movie about a kid who hacks his way
to better grades and almost blows up the world .
suddenly , they all realized that computer were awesome !
dude ! i just saw the best movie ever !
&quot; wargames . &quot;
all this time , i thought computers
were for lazy @-@ eyed losers like you ,
but they &apos;re actually badass .
thank you ?
can you do any of that stuff ?
i can make you a really sweet banner .
i have print shop .
can you start a global thermonuclear war on this thing ?
probably .
don &apos;t do it ! there is no winner .
what else ?
but what about hacking the school ?
can you change my grades ?
well , i would if i was in the jtp .
uh , it &apos;ll take some convincing &apos; cause the guys
all think you suck , but ... i &apos;ll make it happen .
welcome to the jenkin town posse .
while i was one step closer to coolness ,
my mom was about to take 50 steps back .
stop , stop .
&apos;sup , ladies ?
why are you dressed like a giant doily ?
just expressing myself like our gal madonna .
mom , that &apos;s &quot; el &quot; debarge . he &apos;s a dude .
and since when do you like madonna , anyway ?
oh , since i heard her rockin &apos; song about staying a virgin .
it &apos;s very cool to wait .
is that my sixth @-@ grade tutu ?
mom , why -- what are you doing with your hips ?
stop it with your hips .
why are you moving your hips like that ?
mom ? okay .
no , mom , stop .
well , i just want to hang out with my girls , right ?
um , what do you say we , uh ,
read some teen magazines and gossip about boys ?
i &apos;ll go first .
i like murray . you go , lainey .
uh , you smudged your beauty mark all over your upper lip .
okay , you need to go . come on .
what ?
you let louise rubin hang out . why not the bevernator ?
i &apos;m fun , too !
of course you are , just not hang @-@ out fun --
more like a &quot; i have a freckle and i need you
to tell me if it &apos;s worth being looked at
by a dermatologist &quot; kind of fun .
every freckle is worth being looked at by a dermatologist .
why don &apos;t you schedule an appointment for next weekend ?
we can hang @-@ out then , okay ?
yeah .
madonna was a bust ,
so my mom went to plan &quot; b &quot; -- dermatology .
no , i can &apos;t wait six weeks to see dr. krogen !
he &apos;s the last chance i have to bond with my daughter .
please don &apos;t take this away from me !
i &apos;m begging you !
this sad display made the impossible happen --
my dad got off his ass .
good news -- your gonna hang with your mom tomorrow .
no freaking way .
oh , yes freaking way .
or else all the things i don &apos;t care about ,
i &apos;m gonna start having strong opinions on ,
like your allowance -- gone !
no !
curfew ? 6 : 00 p.m.
what ?
skirt length ?
no skirts !
what ?
just pants with pleats .
not the pleats .
pleats a plenty .
your mom is upstairs hurting , and i can &apos;t bear to watch it .
so what &apos;s it gonna be ?
as my sister was facing a night with my mom ,
i was facing the reality
of what hacking was in the &apos; 80s ...
... impossible .
this phone is sick or something .
hang up ! i @-@ i &apos;m trying to hack !
this is a nightmare .
i mean , i &apos;m starting to think a major motion picture
has lied to me about the capabilities of home computers .
o @-@ okay , relax . how can i help ?
you can &apos;t ! i &apos;ll never be in the jtp !
come on , adam . you &apos;re a great kid .
those guys will learn to love you
if you just be yourself .
wait . learning .
that &apos;s it ! you &apos;re a genius !
really ?
i @-@ i just said some pat things to make you feel better ,
but i &apos;ll take it .
if barry and his friends wanted me to hack ,
that was exactly what i &apos;d do -- hack their brains .
access granted . we &apos;re in .
yes ! sweet ! awesome !
okay , in order for me to hack your grades ,
i &apos;ll need to go in
and input all the data that &apos;ll be on your test .
wait , why would you have to do that if --
no time to argue !
jeff schwartz , which significant
historical event occurred in october , 1929 ?
the stock market crashed .
naked rob , verify .
he &apos;s right . he &apos;s right .
uh , it ended the jazz age and began the great depression .
andy cogan , what did president roosevelt
call his program to jump @-@ start the economy ?
the new deal , enacted in 1933 .
okay , open your books to chapter 2 .
go , go , go !
let &apos;s hack .
no , naked rob &apos;s right . it was plessy vs. ferguson .
so awesome we didn &apos;t have to learn this crap for the test .
yeah . yeah .
they weren &apos;t a smart crew , but now they were my crew .
wow . that is a cauldron of cheese .
i read about it in tiger beat .
they say &quot; fondue equals fun @-@ due ! &quot;
do they ?
so , let &apos;s go wild , huh ?
hot , hot , hot ! hot !
excuse me ?
i &apos;d like to report some unsafe cheese .
what if someone tried to feed that to an infant or a dog ?
mom , look who it is ! what a coincidence !
erica , mrs. goldberg , what are you guys doing here ?
just hangin &apos; ,
not in like a mother @-@ daughter way ,
but more of like in a girlfriends way .
isn &apos;t that cool ?
totally .
speaking of cool , we &apos;re gonna go volunteer
at the soup kitchen for extra credit .
wait a minute , erica .
don &apos;t you need some extra credit ?
thanks for looking out , jill . you &apos;re such a good friend .
wow . extra credit .
you should definitely do that .
say , what &apos;s the name of this soup kitchen ?
helping hands , uh ... feeding needy mens
and ... a lady who is also hungry .
we should go .
yeah .
you tried to ditch me ?
my own daughter ?
yes !
the only reason i &apos;m here is because dad forced me .
well , i &apos;ll tell you what , buttercup --
as of now , i &apos;m ditching you .
what ? you can &apos;t ditch me .
oh , you &apos;ve been ditched .
uh , no .
i &apos;m the ditcher here , not you .
well , the ditch got switched .
i will not be ditched .
the ditch is done .
the moment had finally come .
the jtp had accepted me into their fold .
it was time to see how the other half lived .
brain freeze ! we &apos;re insane !
yeah .
turns out , the other half lived like a bunch of idiots .
dude , that hurt so bad . that was awesome .
yeah ?
yeah .
no , man !
your feet and hands should be in sync .
go ! go ! naked rob doing what he do !
yeah !
guys , i just found a toaster in the trash can .
sweet ! let me throw it up in the air !
yes !
it &apos;s more broken now !
madman schwartz strikes again !
the guys promised me girls and stolen mascots ,
but all i got was 6 % dumber .
hey , dad .
bevy ?
i thought you &apos;d be elbow deep in some hot cheese by now .
erica cannot even cold chill with me for a single night .
be honest with me --
am i the lamest person on the planet ?
uh ... let &apos;s get you a drink .
ray .
relax , bevy .
you don &apos;t need to be cool . that &apos;s what you got me for .
but i want to be . teach me to be cool , daddy ?
no can do . you either got it , or you don &apos;t .
&apos;sup , baby ?
but , hey , that doesn &apos;t mean that you can &apos;t have a good time .
well , i &apos;ve been trying to have a good time all day ,
which is why i ate all the cheese ...
which is sitting like a rock , by the way .
well , that &apos;s your problem , honey -- you try too hard .
you want fun ? well , buckle up , old man .
pops was right -- it was time for beverly goldberg
to care less and drink more .
... or just stick to daiquiris .
that was fun .
dude ! you &apos;re our hero !
what ? why ?
because the hacking worked !
we just found out we got b &apos;s on our history test .
it &apos;s awesome !
we got a bio test on monday . let &apos;s get hacking .
i &apos;d love to help , but this game doesn &apos;t have a saving function .
if i quit now , i @-@ i &apos;d lose my place .
then lose your stupid place .
oh , my god !
how clueless can you guys be ?
shut up and hack for your posse !
hacking isn &apos;t real .
what ? ! then how did we get b &apos;s ?
&apos;cause i actually tricked you boneheads into studying .
you taught us ? that &apos;s so messed up , dude .
yeah , we trusted you and you lied to us
like senator mccarthy lied to congress
about the threat of communism in 1953 .
and , oh , my god , why do i know this ? !
we were right about you , man . you &apos;re just a nerd .
i &apos;m a nerd ? well , what about you putzes ?
all you guys do is hang around in a parking lot
hiding from girls .
i mean , the craziest thing that happened
was jeff schwartz ate a hoagie !
in 20 seconds ! like a madman !
he ate dinner , barry . he ate dinner !
you take that back !
that &apos;s it .
we &apos;re kicking you both out of the jtp forever .
what ? ! why me ? !
uh , because he &apos;s your brother
and he just shined a light on us
that makes us question everything !
you can &apos;t kick me out . i &apos;m the founding member .
yeah , and now you &apos;re banned , like how the volstead act
banned alcohol from the country in 1919 .
it &apos;s 1920 , bro .
good catch , bro .
jtp out .
thanks a lot !
while barry went to bed angry at me ,
my sister was wide awake and about to learn
what it felt like to be a worried , uncool mother .
where have you been ? !
i &apos;ve been worried sick about you !
do you have any idea what time it is ? !
yes . it &apos;s time to boogie .
o @-@ okay , honey , you &apos;ve done enough boogie for one night .
oh , my god . she &apos;s drunk .
you are such a bad influence .
come on . be cool about this .
it is not my job to be cool .
you are not hanging out with her again . understood ?
wait , this is important . this is important .
what ?
i love you , too , mommy .
okay , you can handle it from here .
i got a meter running .
okay , she is a train wreck .
please do not leave me alone with her .
your mother &apos;s taken care of you your whole life .
the least you can do is take care of her for one night .
yeah ! and you know what else ?
mom , i want waffles .
mom , waffles .
mom , waffles .
mom , waffles , mom , waffles , mom , waffles .
hey , get away !
i just got her down .
i got you covered in here , big guy !
&quot; i am sor &quot; ?
it &apos;s supposed to say &quot; sorry . &quot;
i ran out of ink , and even this took me an hour to print .
i made waffles .
your apology &apos;s not accepted ! you made me lose my crew !
okay , so maybe we weren &apos;t the coolest ,
and madman jeff schwartz isn &apos;t that crazy ,
and naked rob &apos;s got real problems ,
but i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve never had close friends before .
then you just got to make it up to them .
how ? !
we do the one thing the jtp never had the guts to do --
steal the germantown mascot .
radical !
class started five minutes ago .
here you go , my good man .
hall pass .
get to class .
slow down ! you &apos;re making it nervous !
this is awesome !
not awome !
i thought you were stealing a costume ,
not a real freaking falcon !
oh , crap !
good morning , sunshine .
feel as good as you look ?
i am so sorry about last night .
i hope i didn &apos;t do anything too embarrassing .
well , you cried and said &quot; i love you &quot; a lot ,
so no different from normal .
what was i thinking ?
you were thinking that i &apos;m awful for trying to ditch you .
no . you &apos;re wonderful .
you took care of your mom all night long .
hey , that was just for one night ,
and i wanted to die .
somehow , you do it every day for all of us ,
and that &apos;s actually pretty cool .
i love you so much .
are you still drunk ?
just buzzed .
but every &quot; i love you &quot; is for real .
dude , goldberg stole the germantown high mascot .
couldn &apos;t have done it alone , ari .
this was the work of the jtp .
yes !
jtp , jtp , jtp ... !
yep , with a little help from me and apple ii plus ,
barry was back in the jtp .
why do they make him wear this stupid bird hat anyway ?
jtp ! jtp !
he &apos;ll come back .
that &apos;s the thing about family .
they may not be the coolest cats on the planet ,
but they &apos;re always there to take care of you
when you need them most .
hey , what you up to ?
mom got a new toaster .
thought i &apos;d maybe call the jtp .
and we &apos;d have some fun .
cool .
actually , you know what would be even more fun ?
if just you and me broke it together .
just us ? are you serious ?
as serious as truman was about the taft @-@ hartley act .
here .
friends may come and go , but when it comes to family ,
they &apos;ll always be there , watching over you .
number one , dad . he &apos;s number one .
you &apos;re stewed , buttwad . that &apos;s from &quot; weird science . &quot;
so we can look back in a hundred years from now
and say , &quot; hey , we had a great life . &quot;
jtp , jtp !
you know , i like little houses and big trees . that &apos;s --
guess what . i went back to the photo kiosk at the mall .
and i scored you all some pretty sweet stuff .
for murray ,
a tie so we can be with you all day long at work .
i think you &apos;re missing the point of work .
for adam , a pillow with my face
so i can give you snuggies all night long .
yes . i &apos;ll sleep easy now .
for barry , a big , tasty hat for your big , tasty head .
nice !
and finally , erica .
i know you &apos;re all cool and would never wear any of this stuff ,
so i just got you cash .
oh , my god , i love you !
what the hell is this ?
bev bucks . you trade them for kisses .
no .
first one &apos;s free .
take it back .
first one &apos;s free !
i don &apos;t want it . i don &apos;t -- - kissy , kissy , kissy !
