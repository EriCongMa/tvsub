hey , i &apos;m having dinner with my dad tomorrow night . do you wanna come ?
sure , yeah . he &apos;s kind of sexy .
oh , no , i &apos;ll be there too .
so we &apos;ll come up with some kind of signal . if it &apos;s going well , you can take off .
no , i just need you there for support . i haven &apos;t told him that i &apos;m pregnant yet .
oh . why not ?
because i know he &apos;s gonna flip out , and i hate it when he &apos;s angry .
rachel , this is all so &quot; papa don &apos;t preach . &quot;
no , phoeb , wait . he &apos;s a scary guy . i mean , one time he caught me smoking .
he said if he ever saw me doing that again , he &apos;d make me eat the entire pack .
wow . well , i will be there .
gosh , i &apos;m not gonna let that man make you eat your baby !
hey , who is that guy ? i think i know him .
no , you don &apos;t .
oh , my god ! monica , he &apos;s the stripper from your bachelorette party !
her what ?
your secret bachelorette party .
you had a bachelorette party ?
she untied his g @-@ string with her teeth .
somebody stop me !
we weren &apos;t having bachelor , bachelorette parties . we agreed that it &apos;s a silly tradition .
it &apos;s a grand tradition !
i &apos;m sorry . they surprised me . there was nothing i could do .
well , you could &apos;ve untied it with your hands .
this is so unfair . the one thing i wanted was to throw my best friend a bachelor party ..
but i wasn &apos;t allowed . all we got was a stupid steak dinner .
you went home with the waitress .
yeah , that was a pretty good night .
i can &apos;t believe you didn &apos;t tell me .
you know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty .
i knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass .
the.one.with.the.stripper
i &apos;ll order everyone the moroccan chicken .
oh , i don &apos;t eat meat .
it &apos;s chicken !
i don &apos;t eat that either .
i never understand you lesbians .
so , baby , tell me , what &apos;s new with you ?
well , actually ..
your &apos; 74 lafite , sir .
i ordered the &apos; 75 . that &apos;s a magnificent wine . the &apos; 74 is sewage !
why would you bring me sewage ?
is that a hard question ? are you an idiot ? is that why you &apos;re a waiter ?
this is why i told the manager i wouldn &apos;t wait on you .
oh , come on . don &apos;t be such a baby .
in case you didn &apos;t notice , that is a scary man .
he &apos;s right , though . the &apos; 74 is absolute piss .
this was such a huge mistake . i can &apos;t tell him , phoebe . i can &apos;t .
rachel ..
i &apos;m gonna wait a couple of years , and then the baby will tell him
why ? so he can get mad at the baby ?
hey , that is the baby &apos;s problem .
everything okay with the waiter ?
i have no idea . i went to the bathroom .
so , sweetie , you were starting to tell me what is new with you .
i got tivo .
what &apos;s tivo ?
it &apos;s slang for &quot; pregnant . &quot;
phoebe
well , what were you thinking asking me to come ?
are you really pregnant ?
well , yes and no .
except , not no .
so to sum it up , yeah .
who is the father ? oh , no . please don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s her .
no , it &apos;s ross . it &apos;s ross . you like ross .
daddy , i hope you &apos;re okay with all of this .
think about it . this is a good thing . this is your first grandchild !
you &apos;re gonna be a poppy !
that &apos;s true . i &apos;m a poppy !
i &apos;m gonna be a poppy !
so when is the wedding ?
the who ?
the wedding . there &apos;s going to be a wedding .
young lady , don &apos;t you sit there and tell me my first grandchild is gonna be a bastard !
tell me there &apos;s gonna be a wedding !
february 2nd !
it was cool seeing you lecture today .
thanks . although it kind of seemed like you were falling asleep .
no , i had my eyes closed so i could concentrate and , you know , take it all in .
yeah , a lot of my students do that .
i &apos;ve got to get going .
okay , i &apos;ll see you tonight ?
thanks for showing me your semiprecious @-@ stone collection . it &apos;s amazing .
my god , you must be good in bed .
so you and mona , it &apos;s been a while now . how &apos;s it going ?
it &apos;s good . it &apos;s going good .
i mean , we get along great . she &apos;s so ..
hot ?
i was gonna say sweet , but yeah !
she &apos;s okay with the baby ?
i haven &apos;t actually told her yet . i don &apos;t wanna scare her off .
you have to be honest . otherwise , you may think you &apos;re going down the same path ..
but you &apos;re really going down different ones .
i &apos;m gonna take that book and i &apos;m gonna beat you to death with it .
oh , my god , you are gonna love me so much .
oh , good . because so far in this marriage , i just like you a lot .
all right . i felt bad about the bachelorette party thing ..
so tonight you &apos;re gonna have a bachelor party .
i got this number from this guy at work and i hired a stripper to come dance for you .
am i going in the wife hall of fame or what ?
honey , that &apos;s crazy . i don &apos;t want a stripper .
will you let the lady talk ?
come on , it &apos;ll be fun . it &apos;ll make me feel so much better .
i got you party hats and porn .
throw in my father making out with the magician ..
and it &apos;s just like my 14th birthday all over again .
look , i appreciate it , but it &apos;s a little creepy . i &apos;m not a bachelor anymore .
don &apos;t think of it as a bachelor party . think of it as a two @-@ month anniversary present .
sure . one year is paper , but two months is lap dance .
please , i feel so bad . just watch the hot woman get naked !
fine , but i &apos;m only doing this for you .
yeah !
and joey .
thank you . who else do you wanna invite ?
ross and joey is embarrassing enough .
actually , sorry , i can &apos;t even make it . i &apos;m seeing mona tonight .
who would cancel an actual date just to go to a fake bachelor party ?
i &apos;m sorry . i gotta cancel tonight , baby .
i &apos;m sorry i won &apos;t make it to your imaginary wedding , but i &apos;m busy that day .
i already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah .
i know , i know . i panicked .
i didn &apos;t want him to start yelling at me like i was some &apos; 74 latour .
it &apos;s lafite .
the &apos; 74 latour is actually drinking quite nicely .
all right , here he comes . i &apos;m gonna tell him . i &apos;m gonna be strong .
i just called a friend of mine .
i think i may be able to book the plaza on short notice .
really ?
the plaza ?
oh , daddy !
right . daddy , i need to talk to you .
what is it , sweetie ?
there &apos;s not gonna be a wedding . ross and i aren &apos;t getting married .
i &apos;m sorry , daddy .
i don &apos;t believe this !
daddy , stay calm , please .
how do you expect me to stay calm ?
this is unacceptable , rachel . and i wanna know why !
is it because that punk won &apos;t marry you ?
is that it ?
yes . he says i &apos;m damaged goods .
you nervous about getting married ?
what are you doing ?
let &apos;s pretend it &apos;s a real bachelor party , before your wedding . it &apos;ll be more fun .
all right . i can &apos;t believe tomorrow &apos;s the big day .
how &apos;s it feel knowing you &apos;re never gonna be with another woman ?
knowing you &apos;re gonna have to wake up to the same face every day ..
until you finally have the sweet release of death .
you &apos;re right . this is more fun .
that &apos;s her ! okay , come on !
which one of you lucky boys is chandler ?
that &apos;s me !
that &apos;s me .
joey tribbiani . big fan .
is that a bedroom ?
yeah , right over there .
all right . whenever you &apos;re ready .
that was weird .
why would she go in the bedroom ?
i &apos;m waiting .
so she &apos;s a ..
yeah , that &apos;s one naked hooker .
i love your place . where is this guy from ?
that &apos;s an 18th @-@ century lndian artifact from calcutta .
oh . wow .
so you &apos;re more than just dinosaurs .
so much more .
oh , my god ! i am so sorry !
forget it . it &apos;s from pier 1 .
sorry .
you think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her ?
i &apos;m gonna kill you !
you know , this is actually not a great time for me .
so come on . explain yourself , geller .
first , you get my rachel pregnant .
you got rachel pregnant ?
who did ?
you did !
yes , i did , but it was a one @-@ night thing . it meant nothing .
oh ? really ? that &apos;s what my daughter means to you , nothing ?
no , sir . she means a lot to me . i care .. i love rachel .
what ?
but not that way .
i &apos;m not in love with her . i love her like a friend .
that &apos;s how you treat a friend , get her in trouble and refuse to marry her ?
hey , i offered to marry her . but i didn &apos;t want to .
well , why not ? so you could spend your time with this tramp ?
tramp ?
i &apos;m sorry . dr. green , mona . mona , dr. green .
i can &apos;t believe there is a naked hooker in there !
maybe she &apos;s a hooker and a stripper ..
but she got confused about what to do .
could be . i mean , technically , she did strip . we just missed it .
ma &apos;am ?
are you also a stripper ?
no , but i can pretend to strip . but that &apos;s gonna cost extra .
okay , here &apos;s the extras : handcuffs , spanking ..
maybe monica &apos;s playing a joke on you .
getting her own husband a hooker . that &apos;s pretty funny .
that is funny . maybe for my birthday she &apos;ll murder someone .
i &apos;ll bet ross was in on it too . i mean , he was &quot; conveniently &quot; busy .
do you mind if i smoke in here ?
actually , i &apos;d rather ..
yeah , go ahead . we &apos;re gonna have to burn that room down anyway .
how could you have kept all this from me ?
i was going to tell you , but ..
you figure you &apos;d get what you wanted , then you &apos;d dump her like you did rachel .
hey , i did not dump rachel . nor are we still together .
can i .. ?
why don &apos;t we just let the machine get that .
hey , ross , it &apos;s joey . there &apos;s a hooker over here ..
and we thought maybe you &apos;d know something about it .
no ! no ! no !
no !
i need to lie down .
hey , guys , can i talk to you for a minute ?
listen , again , i want to urge you to push the duck special ..
because if they don &apos;t eat the duck , you &apos;re going to , and it &apos;s not very good .
tonight &apos;s the night of the big bachelor party ?
thanks for giving me that girl &apos;s number .
no problem . say , who &apos;s the party for ?
for my husband .
you hired your husband a hooker ?
she &apos;s a stripper .
no , she &apos;s a hooker .
is that what they call strippers sometimes ?
when they &apos;re hookers .
oh , my god . stu , i can &apos;t believe you did this .
now , you &apos;re sure she &apos;s a hooker ?
it &apos;s either that , or she &apos;s just the best , most expensive date i ever had .
maybe she meant to get you a hooker .
why would she do that ?
maybe she wants you to learn something .
is there anything you &apos;re really bad at , you know , sexually ?
this is the worst bachelor party ever .
what &apos;s taking you boys so long ?
in a minute !
&quot; in a minute &quot; ? what &apos;s gonna happen in a minute ?
all right . maybe you should ask her to leave .
why me ?
hey , it &apos;s your bachelor party .
which is why you should do it .
i don &apos;t want to . you do it .
all right . rock , paper , scissors for who has to tell the whore to leave .
what ?
i miss this .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;ve actually done this before .
no , i miss hanging out with you .
we still hang out .
not like we used to .
remember ? you and me , we used to be inseparable .
you know , now it &apos;s like things are different .
well , you know , things are different . i &apos;m married now .
and , hey , don &apos;t get me wrong , i am so happy for you guys .
i just miss hanging out . just us , you know ?
yeah , i miss that too .
i &apos;ll tell you what . from now on , we &apos;ll make time to hang out .
you got it . come here .
oh , god .
listen , i am this close to robbing you guys .
she &apos;s a hooker ! she &apos;s a hooker ! she &apos;s a ..
hi . we spoke on the phone .
so your dad dropped by .
he &apos;s a pleasant man .
oh , no .
i better go .
just over here . i don &apos;t wanna miss the fight .
ross , i am so sorry .
i promise , i will straighten this out with him tomorrow , in person .
or via e @-@ mail .
i don &apos;t care about your dad . i care about mona . she was there and she &apos;s freaked out !
okay , i &apos;ll fix that too . what &apos;s her e @-@ mail address ?
all right , i promise , i &apos;ll fix this . i swear . i &apos;ll talk to her .
okay . thank you .
that &apos;s it ? you call that a fight ?
&quot; we were on a break ! &quot; &quot; no , we weren &apos;t ! &quot; what happened to you two ?
thank you so much for coming back over .
oh , good . you &apos;re here .
and i was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable .
no , mona , just hear me out .
first of all , i am so sorry about my father yelling at you .
but i heard that you held your own . you have to tell me how you did that .
focus .
okay .
yes , ross and i used to date .
and yes , we are gonna have a baby .
but we are definitely not getting back together .
how can i be sure of that ?
because we drove each other crazy .
he was possessive , he was jealous . he could never just let the little things go .
trying to date this woman .
none of that compared to how kind and gentle ..
and thoughtful he is .
you probably shouldn &apos;t touch me .
i don &apos;t wanna get in the middle of something so complicated .
i get it , but , mona , what relationship is not complicated ?
we all have our baggage . you must too .
why else would you still be single ?
i &apos;m so gonna leave right now .
should i leave this open ?
i &apos;m not sure yet . why didn &apos;t you just tell me about all this ?
because what &apos;s going on has nothing to do with how i feel about you .
you still should have told me .
i know , and i was going to ..
but i thought it was better that you heard it from rachel &apos;s father .
i made a mistake ..
but it &apos;s only because i really , really like you . really .
okay . i guess you can close the door now .
forgot my purse . oh , you guys made up .
he &apos;s a good kisser , isn &apos;t he ? i &apos;m going !
i swear i didn &apos;t know she was a hooker .
did you let her smoke in here ?
her ass @-@ print is still on your grandmother &apos;s quilt . really want to talk about smoking ?
you know what , i &apos;m gonna make this up to you .
i promised you a stripper ..
and you &apos;re gonna get a stripper .
monica , wait .
what ?
carry on .
these tennis shoes are so tight .
i think i &apos;ll take them off .
could you not narrate ?
gotcha , sailor .
just because you &apos;re not in love with the guy ..
you told your dad the truth .
about an hour ago .
wanna go see a movie ?
yes .
bye , dad .
it &apos;s unacceptable ! what the hell does love have to do with it ?
there are more important things than love .
you have to think about the baby .
you have to think about the consequences of your decisions !
hey , i do think about the consequences of my decisions !
well , what gives you the right to .. ?
go to hell !
