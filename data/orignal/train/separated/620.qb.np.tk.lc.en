第五季 第七集
in a land of myth and a time of magic ,
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young man .
his name ... merlin .
well , this is nice , isn &apos;t it ?
just the two of us .
well , three of us .
merlin ? merlin doesn &apos;t count .
i don &apos;t count .
i &apos;m not here , i &apos;m not actually speaking right now .
aren &apos;t you impressed that i remembered our anniversary ?
but you didn &apos;t remember . i reminded you over a month ago .
yes ... but i remembered that it was today ...
today .
actually , i did .
shut up , merlin !
i did !
arthur !
you &apos;re very fortunate , sire .
a fall like that , you could have broken your neck .
have the men who attacked us been questioned ?
i &apos;m sorry , sire , their wounds were fatal .
we were unable to learn anything from them .
we know one thing -
it can &apos;t have been a coincidence they were there .
sire .
we recovered your saddle from the forest trail .
the girth has been unpicked and re @-@ stitched .
it was designed to break , sire .
it appears , merlin , on this single , solitary occasion ...
you may be right .
afternoon , sir knights .
horses shod and watered as requested .
you are tyr seward ?
i am , sir gwaine .
you know i am .
stable hand to the king ?
that is my honour , yes .
is the king not pleased with my work ?
have i done something wrong ?
you are gelda seward , mother of tyr seward ?
yes ?
and you live here with your son ?
is he in some kind of trouble ?
he &apos;s been arrested on suspicion of treason .
no ! no , that can &apos;t be , you &apos;ve made a mistake !
my tyr &apos;s as loyal to the king as you are !
here .
the thread we found at the boy &apos;s home
matches that used to sabotage your saddle , sire .
who put you up to this , tyr ?
no @-@ one .
no @-@ one &apos;s put me up to anything , sire .
are you saying you acted alone ?
you had no help , no accomplice ?
i don &apos;t know anything about these things you &apos;re talking about .
i &apos;ve done nothing , sire ,
save look after your horse and tack like i always do .
the evidence is staring you in the face .
you can &apos;t deny it .
sire ...
i swear on my mother &apos;s life ...
just give me their name .
why protect them ?
they can &apos;t help you now . just give me their name .
i have no name .
there &apos;s no name to give .
then you leave me no choice .
though it saddens me greatly to do so ,
i must charge you with treason .
is there anything further ...
you &apos;d like to say ?
you &apos;re my king , sire .
i &apos;d never do anything to hurt you . never .
tyr seward ,
by the power vested in me i hereby sentence you to death .
how long have you known tyr ?
he &apos;s been in my service since he was a boy .
do you really think him capable of this treason ?
what i think is irrelevant - the facts speak for themselves .
arthur , to sentence him to death ...
the law is the law , merlin , whether i like it or not .
why would tyr want arthur dead ? it makes no sense .
perhaps he harboured some grudge , some festering resentment .
what grudge could he bear ?
he loved his work , he was deeply proud of it .
and arthur respected him , i know he did .
he always treated him fairly and well .
merlin , it &apos;s not always possible to know
what &apos;s in the mind of another man .
maybe so , but arthur was right about one thing .
tyr could not have done this alone , someone else is involved .
and , unless we find out who they are ,
what &apos;s to stop them from trying it again ?
arthur .
i know you were fond of tyr , but you had no choice .
he was guilty .
tyr seward is a simple man .
he can &apos;t have planned this assassination himself .
well , i know that &apos;s what you &apos;d like to think . we all would .
but , hard as it is to accept , even a great and honourable king
has enemies within his walls .
very often the last person you would suspect .
tyr is just such a person .
no , you &apos;re right .
i suppose experience should have taught me that by now .
the important thing is he didn &apos;t succeed .
i &apos;ve already lost my brother , i couldn &apos;t bear to lose you , too .
i &apos;m here , guinevere .
i always will be .
i &apos;ll never leave you , i promise you that .
thought you might like some food .
cooking &apos;s not gaius &apos;s strong point , as you know .
well , least it &apos;s not the turnip stew !
thank you , merlin .
i &apos;d like to help you , tyr , if i can .
you heard the king .
no @-@ one can help me now .
i know you , tyr .
whatever you did , i don &apos;t believe you meant any harm .
i didn &apos;t do anything . on my honour , i didn &apos;t .
but something happened , didn &apos;t it ?
no ...
tyr , please .
i know you &apos;re not to blame , just tell me what happened .
no ! they &apos;ll ...
who ?
this was a few days back .
one of the horses came down with colic
so i had to sleep in the stable to watch over him ...
go on , it &apos;s all right .
that night , i was woke up by a sound .
there was someone there , going over the king &apos;s saddle .
i knew it wasn &apos;t right .
i tried to get away and warn someone ...
but they saw me .
they told me if i so much as whispered a word of what i &apos;d seen ...
.. they &apos;d take my mother .
they &apos;d take her ...
and they &apos;d cut her throat .
who was it ?
i can &apos;t !
tyr , please , tell me .
this is the only chance you have .
you &apos;ll be hanged if you don &apos;t ...
and they &apos;ll kill my mother if i do .
tyr ...
.. i can help you .
no .
if it means me dying instead of her , then so be it .
i &apos;d rather die .
you went to the cells to see tyr ?
yes .
we &apos;ve been over this before , we know what he said .
the evidence doesn &apos;t lie .
no @-@ one denies the crime , sire ,
but the only part that tyr played was to see it done .
he told you this ?
five minutes ago .
then who was it ?
he won &apos;t say , he &apos;s too frightened . they threatened him .
i must speak with him , at once .
arthur , surely it can wait ?
gaius told you to rest , let your injuries heal .
i &apos;ll be fine , guinevere .
i just want to hear what he has to say .
and you shall .
but tyr &apos;s said all he &apos;s willing to say for now .
he &apos;s clearly frightened and unsure of what to do - don &apos;t push him .
let him think it over
and maybe after a night in the cells he &apos;ll be prepared to say more .
as always , guinevere ...
you &apos;re right .
have you noticed anything about gwen of late ?
nothing unusual . why ?
i &apos;m not sure exactly .
something she &apos;s said ? something she &apos;s done ?
no . it &apos;s nothing in particular .
it just seems to me that ever since she returned from the dark tower
she hasn &apos;t been quite herself .
well , is that so surprising ? she lost her only brother .
elyan was all the family she had .
and grief changes people , merlin .
i know that . i do , but ...
besides , we can only guess at what morgana put her though .
that &apos;s what worries me .
tyr .
what are you doing here ?
nothing to worry about . i just want to talk .
i &apos;ve said nothing !
come closer .
we don &apos;t want to be heard , do we ?
i &apos;ve told no names .
i &apos;ve not mentioned you to anyone .
i believe you .
my mother &apos;s safe ? you &apos;ve not harmed her ?
your mother is alive and well . she &apos;s not the problem .
you are .
me ?
you see , tyr , it &apos;s not what you haven &apos;t said .
it &apos;s what you may yet say .
don &apos;t ...
understand ?
the blade punctured his heart .
he suffered very little , i &apos;m glad to say .
you &apos;ve spoken to the night patrols ?
they saw nothing unusual , sire .
what about the guards ? why didn &apos;t they raise the alarm ?
sire . we found this in a grate in the guard @-@ room .
clary wort . a powerful soporific , sire .
i &apos;ve been a fool .
i should have spoken to him when i had the chance .
arthur ...
what ?
whoever did this was no stranger to camelot .
they knew the citadel inside out .
guinevere .
the plan failed . arthur lives .
does he suspect you ?
not yet .
but the stable hand saw me .
he was going to tell them everything .
was ?
you have some good news then .
i did what had to be done .
with tyr gone you have to find someone else to take the fall .
when arthur dies you have to be beyond all suspicion .
you must have the support of the knights -
only with their allegiance will your path to the throne be clear .
but what good is all this ?
arthur &apos;s still alive .
for now .
by tonight you &apos;ll have everything you need to finish the job .
arthur &apos;s doubled the guard , there are patrols night and day .
i can &apos;t risk leaving ...
gwen , gwen .
it is i that will come to you .
go !
gwen ?
i &apos;ve been looking for you everywhere .
arthur &apos;s been beside himself with worry .
well , there was no need to worry ,
i was just walking in the meadow .
since elyan died ...
sometimes i just need time to myself .
i understand , but you should be careful .
a patrol was attacked in the woods only an hour ago .
oh , i had no idea .
thank you , merlin .
i &apos;ll be more careful next time .
no broken bones , i &apos;m glad to say .
anything else you remember ?
nothing . one minute i was pursuing them through the trees .
the next i was flat on the ground .
you &apos;re sure it was sorcery ?
without a doubt . powerful , too .
morgana ?
it &apos;s possible .
but why was she there ?
maybe she was meeting someone .
why would she come so close to the citadel ?
maybe she had to . maybe
whoever she was meeting was here in camelot .
well , until we have more to go on this is idle speculation .
gaius , merlin - see what you can find in the woods .
perhaps there &apos;s something we overlooked .
i &apos;ll go with them .
you &apos;ll do no such thing . you &apos;ll rest , gwaine .
physician &apos;s orders .
i don &apos;t think this is over .
what do you mean ?
whoever &apos;s responsible the attack on arthur &apos;s life ,
what &apos;s to stop them from trying again ?
they haven &apos;t a chance , the citadel &apos;s on full alert .
every entrance , every exit &apos;s being watched.trust me ,
arthur &apos;s safe as long as he remains in camelot .
that &apos;s just it , what if he &apos;s not safe here ?
what if camelot &apos;s the most dangerous place that he could be ?
who could have had access to the stables ,
who could have known the layout of the cells ?
who knew that tyr would do anything to protect his mother ?
you need to stay close to arthur ,
and do whatever you can to protect him .
you have my word on it , merlin .
who are you ?
it matters not who i am ,
but what i want and whether you can give it to me .
and what it is that you want ?
a tincture . with the power to kill .
not just to kill ,
but to do so slowly and with the utmost pain .
very particular , what you seek .
it has a very particular purpose .
well ?
do you possess such a thing ?
i do .
here .
what are they ?
valerian . two drops will render the victim unconscious .
and henbane . a single drop administered through the ear .
their death will be as ...
prolonged and as unpleasant as could be wished for .
these are ... uncommon things .
hard to come by , hard to prepare ...
very generous , my lady , more than enough to buy my wares .
but not my silence .
arthur , are you all right ?
what if merlin &apos;s right ?
what if morgana did attack the patrol ?
morgana ?
she wants me dead .
what better way of achieving that
than conspiring with an ally within camelot ?
an ally who she couldn &apos;t risk meeting within these walls ?
who ?
whoever killed tyr .
but that doesn &apos;t make sense .
if you &apos;re the target , why kill tyr ?
to protect their identity .
perhaps .
tyr &apos;s killer had an intimate knowledge of the palace .
whoever they were , they must be known to me ,
and they must be here as we speak .
if what you say is true , they must be found quickly .
and if they &apos;re not and strike again ?
i will not let that happen .
i would lay down my life to protect you .
you &apos;ll find them , arthur . you and i together .
gaius !
yes , that &apos;s certainly not natural .
it was morgana , i &apos;m sure of it .
are you sure we &apos;re in the right place ?
gwaine said he spotted them somewhere around here .
there . on that branch .
it &apos;s not much to go on , is it ?
raw imported silk .
traders ask a small fortune for it .
whoever that belongs to is extremely wealthy .
what is that ? some kind of embroidery ?
indeed . woven threads of silver and gold .
only those of the highest rank can afford such a thing .
merlin ? where are you going now ?
merlin ?
would you care to explain exactly what it is you &apos;re doing ?
i was just checking for holes .
holes ?
yes . that &apos;s where the hand goes .
granted . but look ...
that , i believe , is where the other hand goes .
right . i &apos;m just saying that you can &apos;t be too careful .
a lady &apos;s modesty is at stake , after all .
is it now ? merlin , i would strongly recommend
you start showing a little less interest in guinevere &apos;s clothing
and a little more interest in mine .
i think i prefer gwen &apos;s .
i &apos;m going to do everything in my power
to try and forget you ever just said that .
i suggest you do the same .
just a few drops will ease your troubles , my dear .
do you understand ?
yes .
come on .
are you prepared ?
have you found someone to take the fall ?
don &apos;t worry . i have someone in mind .
guinevere . i was beginning to wonder where you were .
sorry , i had some business to attend to in town .
i hope you have an appetite .
mmm . and a thirst .
what took you into town ?
oh , just delivering supplies to those most in need .
your kindness never ceases to amaze me .
keep your grubby hands off of my dumplings !
you know , now that i think of it ,
we never got to have our little celebration , did we ?
yes , why was that ?
to us .
all the evidence suggeststhat the king has been poisoned .
you &apos;re certain , gaius ?
quite certain .
the sweating , the corruption of the skin ,
the traces of tincture around the ear .
they all point to the use of henbane .
is there no hope ?
the poison is a deadly one , my lady .
there may be a way to arrest its course but i cannot guarantee it .
one thing i know for certain . whoever did this lives among us .
whoever did this has betrayed us all .
someone who is free to roam this citadel as they please ,
someone who has access to the king &apos;s stables ,
the king &apos;s prison ...
.. even the king &apos;s food .
there is only one i know of ...
merlin .
how is arthur ?
there is no change .
i know how you must feel - about merlin .
you must believe me when i say how sorry i am .
but the evidence against him is overwhelming .
you did what you had to do , guinevere .
you had no choice .
i understand that .
thank you .
is there no hope , gaius ? none at all ?
i will not lie to you .
arthur &apos;s time is nearly upon him .
but until the king draws his last breath ,
there is always hope .
you were right , merlin . whatever morgana did in the dark tower ,
she &apos;s taken control over gwen and used her to get to arthur .
can you save him ?
the poison is too strong , too virulent .
your magic is his only hope .
you need to get me out of here somehow .
you promised you &apos;d never leave me , arthur . you promised .
he is our strength , our heart .
how can i live without him ?
how can any of us live without him ?
because we must .
my lady . if arthur is to die , we will lose more than that .
the kingdom will lose its king .
while arthur lives , there is still a king of camelot .
but when the time comes ,
and it will surely come soon ,
we need to be prepared .
if we do not have a leader
and a guide ...
.. camelot and all the kingdom will be vulnerable .
everything arthur worked so hard to achieve will be threatened .
but who could wear his crown ?
he has no family to succeed him .
and who among us is ... worthy of such a thing ?
you are , my lady .
me ?
you are as close to family as arthur has .
no @-@ one can deny your wisdom , your compassion and your loyalty .
i am certain that were arthur able to make this decision ,
he would choose you .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
i realise that this is a great responsibility
but you will not be alone .
i guarantee you , myself and all the knights will stand by you .
now and forever .
thank you , leon .
i am lucky indeed to have such friends .
who are you ?
what kind of a damn fool question is that ?
i am who i am and i am who i was and i am who i will always be .
that &apos;s no answer .
what other answer is there ?
it &apos;s the only answer worth giving .
what are you doing here ?
incredible .
you follow one idiot question with another .
i &apos;m visiting the cells , as you perfectly well know .
no , you &apos;re not . not unless we say so , you &apos;re not .
but you already said so . only ten minutes ago you said so .
you said so and i did so !
no , we didn &apos;t .
what on earth is wrong with you ?
something interesting in your tea , is there ?
it &apos;s hardly any wonder your prisoners are being murdered
if you can &apos;t even remember
who you &apos;re letting in and who you &apos;re letting out . you let me in !
and i thank you for that .
and now , apparently , i have to let myself out . ah !
goodbye !
you ! what are you doing in my kitchen ?
nothing .
nothing means mischief in my book .
you &apos;ve been reading the wrong book .
and mischief means theft .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
and theft means my pies .
your pies ?
why on earth would anyone want to steal your godforsaken pies ?
my pies are the talk of camelot !
oh , yes , indeed they are .
a crust like rusted iron ,
a filling like last year &apos;s horse dung ,
and the smell , oh , yes , just like the guardhouse &apos;s latrine !
no @-@ one insults my pies and gets away with it !
oh , i &apos;m sorry ! should i speak instead of your poisonous flans ?
like vomit curdling in the noonday sun !
or your dumplings !
the king himself likened them
to freshly @-@ lain frogspawn wrapped in pig &apos;s snot !
what would you know about
the king and my dumplings ?
oh , good grief .
should have done that years ago .
you there !
you ! halt !
there ! this way !
he &apos;s gone . we &apos;ve lost him !
inform the men we have an intruder .
put the citadel on high alert .
that was no wind . that was sorcery .
light the braziers !
search the courtyard !
are you all right ?
yes .
you haven &apos;t seen anything ?
heard anything ?
nothing . why ?
there &apos;s an intruder within our walls .
here ? in the citadel ?
yes , my lady .
we last saw them in the main square , then lost sight of them .
my lady , you may be in danger .
gwaine will take you to the guest chambers .
he &apos;ll ensure no harm comes to you there .
why would anyone wish me harm ?
you are to be our leader , gwen . you are camelot &apos;s future .
do you imagine our enemies don &apos;t want you dead ?
i can &apos;t leave arthur , not now .
gwen , i promise ,
if there is any change , i &apos;ll fetch you at once .
gaius is right . come , my lady .
you &apos;re not safe here .
how on earth did you get in here ?
don &apos;t even ask .
how is he ?
his heart has nearly stopped .
i fear he &apos;s close to death .
the sickness is so deep in him .
i don &apos;t know if i have the power to bring him back .
you can do this , merlin .
ic the thurhaele
thinu licsar
mid thamsundorcraeft
thaere ealdan ae !
gaius ...
merlin ...
well done , merlin ! well done .
you &apos;d better get back to the cells before you &apos;re missed .
there are guards on every floor and stairwell . how can i get back down ?
the same way you came up , obviously .
obviously ...
morning , merlin .
if you &apos;ve got a moment , the king would like a word .
merlin !
this is one of the two ...
possibly three moments in my life
where i &apos;ve actually been glad to see you .
that &apos;s my thoughts exactly , sire .
how &apos;re you feeling ?
like death . well , death warmed up , at least .
i can imagine .
it seems like we &apos;ve both been through something of an ordeal .
it wasn &apos;t so bad , really .
once you get used to the eternal night and the rats ,
the mouldy pillows , living with a bucket of your own ...
merlin .
i &apos;m sorry about what happened to you . truly .
as soon as i heard , i told them
it couldn &apos;t have been you who poisoned me .
i had the cook confirm your alibi .
thank you .
i also told them you simply weren &apos;t bright enough
to organise an assassination attempt .
that &apos;s very thoughtful .
you &apos;re welcome .
arthur ...
there is something i need to talk to you about .
sorry , merlin ,
another time . they &apos;re waiting for me in the council chambers .
thanks to guinevere , some new evidence has come to light .
the queen found these vials in my chambers .
they bear , as you can see , a distinctive mark .
thanks to her tireless efforts , she has been able to trace them .
this is your mark , is it not ?
it is my mark , yes .
and what does this vial contain ?
it ... it &apos;s valerian , sire .
what does it do ?
it renders the subject unconscious .
this one ?
henbane .
it &apos;s a poison , my lord .
a lethal poison .
and it is only thanks to the great skill of my physician
that i am still alive .
i &apos;m sorry , my lord . i supplied it , i confess .
but i did not know it was intended for you .
in truth , i was ... too afraid to ask .
too afraid to ask who ?
she who ... procured it .
and did you recognise this woman ?
well , i cannot say for certain but i believed it to be morgana pendragon .
because of the queen &apos;s diligence , the truth has been uncovered .
each and every one of us owes her a great debt .
long live the queen .
long live the queen !
long live the queen !
long live the queen !
long live the queen !
long live the queen !
long live the queen !
long live the queen !
long live the queen ...
you &apos;re not happy with your husband ?
i &apos;d be happy if he died tomorrow .
