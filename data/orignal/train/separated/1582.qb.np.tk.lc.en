i can &apos;t !
what &apos;s wrong ?
we tried to have sex ,
i freaked out , like a panic attack .
i was raped . yeah .
that guy who ... ?
i thought i put it behind me but i still have some stuff
i have to work through .
take as long as you need .
lena gonna be ok ?
yeah , now , but she lost the baby .
you &apos;re just so good ,
you make the rest of us look bad .
well , there &apos;s nothing i can do about that .
well , i mean , you could try to blend in .
this is a dance team .
what ? should i dye my hair ?
we got a letter from ana .
she wants to see the twins to make amends .
oh , wow . what did you do ?
i called mike and i told him
that she &apos;s never coming anywhere
near our kids ever again .
good .
girls ! everyone out ! out of the house !
where &apos;s becca ? becca ? !
got her . clear away !
she is gonna be ok .
i seriously have like nothing to wear .
and mat won &apos;t tell me where we &apos;re going
so i don &apos;t know what to wear !
too big bird ?
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re not big anything .
more tweety bird .
ha @-@ ha . seriously .
i need something like , sexy but not too sexy ,
soft but not easy ,
that says i &apos;m a girl ,
but don &apos;t treat me like one .
right , so you &apos;re looking for really pretty armor ?
no . i just ...
mat can be a little confrontational .
ok , a lot confrontational .
i mean , the boy feels the need to say everything he thinks .
so i wanna be pretty but protected .
attractive , just not vulnerable .
yeah . like you .
you want some syrup for that , bud ?
since when do you work sundays ?
i &apos;m escorting a funeral .
since mama and jude aren &apos;t gonna be back until tomorrow ,
i thought i &apos;d pick up a little off @-@ duty security work .
unless you don &apos;t want me to go .
that fire was pretty intense . i can cancel , you know .
no , no . i have therapy anyway . i &apos;m fine .
ok . you sure ?
yeah , i &apos;m just happy everyone got out safe .
yeah .
where &apos;s everybody now ? all the girls , i mean ?
they went back to juvie ,
until they can find a new place , if they can find place .
what does that mean ?
well , i guess there aren &apos;t many landlords
who wanna rent to a group home , so ...
well , i &apos;m sure they &apos;ll find something .
rita doesn &apos;t strike me
as the type of person who &apos;d gives up easily .
so what time is the funeral gonna be over ?
as long as it takes to get the guy in the ground ,
i guess , why ? planning another party ?
what do you mean ?
i was just asking . i have a big paper i &apos;m writing .
it &apos;d be easier to have no one here to distract me .
well i have a music thing with lou downtown ,
so i won &apos;t be here .
oh yeah ? why don &apos;t you ...
maybe you could take callie with you .
oh no , i don &apos;t wanna crash your thing .
it &apos;s not a thing . we &apos;re just hanging . you should come .
really ?
yeah . i could pick you up after therapy .
um , ok , well i &apos;ll think about it .
i &apos;ll call you after i &apos;m done .
ok .
hey miss thing . nice jacket .
cute , right ? thank you .
like i had a choice .
when are mama and jude coming home ?
at least they &apos;re nice to me .
oh , poor baby .
they &apos;ll be back tomorrow .
how &apos;s she doing ?
uh , she &apos;s doing ... she &apos;s doing all right , i think .
yeah , it &apos;s been good for her being out in nature ,
you know , getting a little time off , a little time away .
we all have to be extra sweet to her when she gets back .
losing a baby , is ...
... it &apos;s one of the hardest things you can possibly go through .
all right , i gotta go .
oh , hey , b , will you drop this off at your dad &apos;s on your way out ?
um ... can &apos;t you ?
yes i can but i asked you to .
thank you .
all right , my babies , i &apos;ll see you later .
all right .
how &apos;s your dad doing , after the breakup ?
it &apos;s so weird . didn &apos;t dani just move in ? what happened ?
um , i don &apos;t know . he &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s none of our business .
sorry i should called . mom asked me to ...
oh , thanks .
no problem .
i &apos;d make you come in and have breakfast ,
but i &apos;m heading out in a minute .
it &apos;s cool . i have stuff to do anyway .
ok . i &apos;ll see you soon ?
yeah , sure .
i &apos;m sorry about that .
i just ... i &apos;m not ready to get into this , with him .
no , don &apos;t worry about it .
i wasn &apos;t really ready to face him either .
guess i can add him to my amends list .
he &apos;s already at the top of mine .
you ... wanna read the next part ?
sure .
&quot; we have a list of all persons we have harmed
and to whom we are willing to make amends .
we made it when we took inventory .
we subjected ourselves to a drastic self @-@ appraisal .
now we go out to our fellows and repair the damage
done in the past . &quot;
so why all the secrecy ?
what kind of music festival is this ?
is it like a rave ?
an underground warehouse death @-@ metal battle of the bands ?
yup . i &apos;m totally bringing you to &apos; the seven levels of hell ,
a sound experience that will explode your eardrums ! &apos;
i &apos;m kidding .
look .
nice .
so when did these panic attacks start ?
well , i &apos;ve been seeing wyatt for a while now .
and we decided we wanted to have sex .
ok . is that something you feel like you &apos;re ready for ?
with wyatt , i mean ?
i do . i did , anyway .
but when we tried , i freaked out .
i couldn &apos;t breathe and i pushed him off of me .
it &apos;s been happening a few times a week since .
i even thought i saw liam the other day , at work .
i think ...
do you think it &apos;s him , liam ?
you mean , do i think the rape is the cause of the panic attacks ?
maybe .
but things like that
generally start closer to the time of the event .
do you trust wyatt ?
yeah , completely .
but you also thought you could trust liam , right ?
and you were wrong .
so how can you trust your own judgment ?
you think i can &apos;t trust my judgment ?
no . i think you think you can &apos;t .
especially when it comes to
making yourself so vulnerable to another person .
i think if you trusted yourself .
i wouldn &apos;t have panicked with wyatt .
i think it &apos;s a possibility .
so , what am i supposed to do ?
did you see any signs
that liam wasn &apos;t who he pretended to be ?
um , i guess , yeah .
people show us who they are , what they &apos;re capable of ,
if we &apos;re paying attention , listening to our gut ,
that &apos;s how we learn to trust ourselves ,
by trusting we will act on our instincts
to keep ourselves safe .
you say you trust wyatt completely
so trust your instincts .
until he gives you a reason not to .
sorry , we almost there .
where are you taking me ?
i &apos;m not telling you .
that &apos;s kinda the point of the blindfold .
fine .
what is this ?
this is where we , you know , the first time .
it &apos;ll be like our first date all over again .
you mean our first hookup ?
by the way , we haven &apos;t even had a real first date .
is this all you think i am ?
some girl to get naked with in your garage ?
no ! no . this is romantic . look flower petals .
i ... picked these myself .
so this is it , huh ?
your plan for our big &quot; special date ? &quot;
sex on a nasty old couch ?
no ! no , this is , um , this is just part one .
i just wanted to spend some time alone together
&apos;cause no one &apos;s home .
then i was gonna take you out .
where ?
hello ?
oh , god . just wait .
hello ?
hi , hayley . how are ya ?
mom , i thought you were supposed to be working that funeral ?
i can see that that &apos;s what you thought .
but , well , they had to cancel .
someone forgot to dig the grave .
so ... what &apos;s up ?
just hanging out .
uh @-@ huh , well , you know the rules :
no hanging out with girls behind closed doors .
that &apos;s not fair . what if i was gay ?
are you ? gay ?
no , but ...
point taken .
then i guess there &apos;s no hanging out with anyone behind closed doors ,
that includes garage doors too .
all right , we were on our way out , anyway .
i see . and what about that big paper that you had to work on ?
i &apos;ll finish it tonight . you ready ?
i &apos;ll just finish blowing out these candles for you ,
bit of a fire hazard there , jesus .
hey .
sorry to crash .
no worries . the more , the merrier .
well , thank you . um , i &apos;m glad you say that , actually .
hey . good to see ya .
you know lou , right ?
yeah we met at your party .
so what is this ?
some kinda mexican street festival ?
seems cool .
yeah , there &apos;s a main stage over there
and they usually play some pretty great music .
nice .
cool . well , um , why don &apos;t we meet up with you there later ?
wyatt and i are gonna have a chow @-@ down .
we are ?
mm @-@ hmm , yeah , we &apos;re both gonna eat one item from every food stall ,
and the first person to say &quot; uncle , &quot; has to pay for it all .
wait , so you think you &apos;re gonna out eat me ?
no , i know i &apos;m gonna out @-@ eat you .
ok , it &apos;s on , girl .
how about we start with a little spicy corn ,
ok .
to line the stomach ?
yeah , how about it ? let &apos;s do it .
we &apos;re not doing that , right ?
no .
ok , all right , cool . let &apos;s go this way .
all right .
my grandfather used to bring me here every year .
he &apos;s a musician . he loves latin music .
you like her ?
who ?
frida kahlo .
i dunno . i mean , she could stand to tweeze a little .
wait , you &apos;ve never heard of frida kahlo ?
no . why ? because i &apos;m a mexican ?
no because she &apos;s like a cultural icon .
yeah , a mexican cultural icon .
yeah , but no , she &apos;s kind of international ?
well i didn &apos;t really grow up in a latino home , so ...
no , that &apos;s not what i meant .
is something wrong ?
no .
wyatt ?
wyatt ?
you ok ?
yeah .
not exactly , no .
ok , well , why not ?
um , i &apos;ve been having these panic attacks ,
ever since we tried to ...
really ?
it &apos;s not your fault at all .
um ... i &apos;m just trying to ...
i &apos;m supposed to practice trusting myself .
i know that sounds dumb but it &apos;s actually harder than you think .
anyway , i didn &apos;t really wanna come here today
&apos;cause the crowds and everything .
but i know that one of the things i can trust is you , so ...
i &apos;m right here .
i was just getting these .
for you , my lady .
nerd .
unless you &apos;re full ?
i mean , we can stop , anytime you want .
all you &apos;ve gotta do is say the word .
no , no , i &apos;m starving .
you &apos;re starving , huh ?
mm @-@ hm .
you &apos;ll definitely enjoy this meatball then .
yeah , cheers . mm @-@ hm .
cheers .
mmmm . delicious .
right ?
tamale ? unless you &apos;ve had enough .
baby , we are just getting started .
i &apos;m really glad you called .
me , too .
hey , liam . i &apos;m hungry , man . let &apos;s go .
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re getting the day off , you deserve it .
it &apos;ll be good for you , a little quiet time to yourself .
not really sure what i &apos;m gonna do with myself .
you don &apos;t have to do anything . why not just ... be ?
i &apos;m serious .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been so great about this trip .
all this time out in the woods has really let me connect ,
you know , with ... this .
ok , earth mother . i got it .
we &apos;re both grieving , honey .
yeah . i know . i &apos;m ok .
ok . maybe you could ,
i dunno , meditate or something ?
i mean it .
i know you do . that &apos;s what scares me .
i will try it , sweetheart . thank you . i love you .
i love you , too .
水管漏水怎么修
oh my god , this is so cool .
how did you know about this ?
i told you , i wanted to do something that &apos;s really special ,
so i did a bunch of research on all the cool events
that were happening this weekend .
i &apos;m sorry i doubted you . i &apos;m very impressed .
and hungry .
yeah ? let &apos;s go get you a taco .
you know what ? i read the best tacos are actually over here .
wow you did do your research .
thank you .
you like this ?
hear that rhythm line ? it &apos;s so intricate .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a guitarro . yeah .
a guitarro .
it &apos;s like a bass . but so much more .
it &apos;s totally the backbone of the band .
what ?
nothing . i just didn &apos;t realize
you were into all these different kinds of music .
you &apos;re full of surprises .
there &apos;s more where that came from .
and of course jesus and sweet mariana .
&quot; taking money from her to buy drugs
was probably the worst thing i ever did . &quot;
i mean , how am i supposed to make amends to those two ?
what &apos;d your sponsor say ? &quot; staying sober &apos;s a good start . &quot;
i get it . i feel the same way about brandon .
yeah , you didn &apos;t abandon your son .
no . not literally .
but i did it in all kinds of other ways .
i mean , the relationship with dani ...
i shoulda never started that so soon after i got sober .
i had brandon living here with me .
i shoulda made him a priority , instead of ...
and it goes all the way back .
after the divorce , i shoulda fought for custody .
or at least partial custody .
but the truth is , i didn &apos;t think i could handle it .
and it &apos;s a lot harder to drink
all the time with a little kid running around .
i managed . with two of &apos; em .
to drink , use coke , use crystal ,
some heroin .
it doesn &apos;t even matter
stef and lena are never gonna let me see them again .
they made that perfectly clear .
it &apos;s too bad .
i think it &apos;s a mistake , not just for you .
what would you say to them ?
i mean , if you could ?
this is really hard .
you know what ? we did a lot of work today .
you ... wanna take a break ?
yeah .
yeah .
best in town . well , that &apos;s what they say , anyway .
thanks .
callie .
what &apos;re you doing here ?
oh , we tagged along with brandon and lou .
they &apos;re here , too ? where are they ?
oh , i don &apos;t know we split up with them a little while ago .
we &apos;re gonna meet them later though for the concert .
oh yay ! we &apos;ll join you .
hey , you know what i think we need ?
i think we need some dulce de leche , something sweet .
yeah , no , i think that &apos;s exactly what we need .
hey , but no puking ! puking &apos;s against the rules !
i don &apos;t wanna be one to toot my own horn .
generally , i prefer you to do that .
but since you &apos;re not here , i guess i &apos;m going to have
to indulge in a little self @-@ congratulation .
check out that pipe !
look at that ! no more leaky pipe !
no more emptying the bowl into the toilet anymore .
how hot is that pipe , huh ? how hot is that pipe ?
and how hot is your mama , huh ?
in her hot tool belt ? in her hot tool belt ?
using power tools , oh , yeah , fixing things .
look at that pipe . look at that pipe .
oh , crap !
oh , crap !
that &apos;s intense .
you should get one .
one : i &apos;m not 18 and two : i &apos;d like to live to be 18,
which i don &apos;t think would happen
if my moms found out i got one of those .
you don &apos;t have to be 18,
for the record , not at a place like this .
really ?
nice . what is it ?
it &apos;s a triple spiral . it &apos;s the wiccan symbol of feminine power .
i &apos;ve got another one , but i can &apos;t really show it to you here .
uh , what time does stuff start on the main stage ?
so you &apos;re not into me ? is that what &apos;s happening ?
because it &apos;s either that or you &apos;re completely oblivious ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure you &apos;re not that stupid .
no , i ...
i mean , i basically just offered to let you see me naked .
i &apos;m not oblivious , ok , and i &apos;m not stupid . i &apos;m just ...
you &apos;re not over callie ?
no .
not into me ?
no .
then what ?
hey , brandon , liam &apos;s here .
what ?
liam &apos;s here !
what ... ? hang on , wyatt ?
i gotta go .
who &apos;s liam ?
he &apos;s this guy who ... i &apos;ll tell you later , all right ?
wyatt ? hey , slow down . what are you doing ?
i saw him over there . i lost him .
you were following him ?
yeah . i don &apos;t want callie to see him .
then let &apos;s grab callie and get outta here .
no why should callie be the one who has to leave ?
hey , dude , think about this . this is not a good idea .
hey , the concert &apos;s about to start , do you think we could ...
you guys go ahead , yeah , i &apos;m sure wyatt &apos;s just gonna be a second .
i &apos;ll meet you there . save us a seat though .
ok . hurry .
uh , can we stop by the ladies room on our way ?
pardon me .
sorry . excuse me .
whoa ! what are you guys doing here ?
i told you i was coming here this morning .
never mind . damn it . i gotta go .
so you did a bunch of research , huh ?
was that just stealing your brother &apos;s idea ,
or was there more to it than that ?
so really you just wanted to use me ? for sex ?
no . no . that &apos;s not it at all . i like you . i really like you .
you know , there are plenty of guys out there
that would treat me like this .
i thought you were different .
i am , i really am different .
i mean it . what do i have to do to prove it to you ?
so you wanna make sure it &apos;s in there as close as you can get it .
and give it a whack .
i shouldn &apos;t say &quot; whack . &quot;
i mean , tap it , very gently .
well , look who &apos;s here ? hey , mike !
ana and i ...
we &apos;re working the program together .
i got 60 days , 60 days clean .
i wrote stef and lena . i wrote your moms .
i told them i wanted to see you , and jesus
just to tell you how sorry i am .
i can &apos;t . i don &apos;t wanna ... i can &apos;t do this ...
whoa whoa , let &apos;s just go somewhere and talk , ok ?
why ? so she can lie to me again ?
no . no .
hey , mariana !
mariana ? hey ! hey !
what &apos;s going on ? are you ok ?
no , i &apos;m not . why did you bring me here ?
is it because i &apos;m not latin enough ?
is it because i dyed my hair ? why ?
no , i brought you here because i love it .
i wanted to share it with you .
oh , because i &apos;m mexican ? if i were korean ,
would you take me to koreatown ?
if i wanted good barbecue , yeah .
ok , i don &apos;t get it , are you offended
that i brought you to a festival
that actually celebrates your culture ?
i mean , it &apos;s not like i made you wear a sombrero
and do tequila shots .
well , i &apos;m sorry , this isn &apos;t my culture .
didn &apos;t you show me a picture of your quinceanera ?
that was just a party .
look , i grew up with stef and lena .
i didn &apos;t eat churros , or dance flamenco ...
flamenco &apos;s not mexican .
don &apos;t do that ! see ? this is what i mean !
this isn &apos;t me . i don &apos;t have any connection to any of this !
i don &apos;t feel anything !
well , you clearly feel something .
why are you yelling at me ?
is this about that woman ? who was that ?
hey , liam .
you need to get the hell out of here .
callie is here . i don &apos;t want her seeing you .
so for once in your life ,
do the right thing and get the hell outta here .
why don &apos;t you get out ?
man , haven &apos;t you put her through enough ?
what about what she put me through ? huh ?
what are you talking about ?
accusing me like she did ,
dragging me into court , in front of my parents
and the whole freaking world .
so what , you &apos;re saying you didn &apos;t rape her ?
yeah , that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .
i had sex with her , but trust me , she wanted it .
hey ! hey ! wyatt , stop ! stop !
come on ! hey , break it up !
hey , that &apos;s enough !
want me to call the cops ?
no .
ok , folks , move on .
show &apos;s over .
well , that was something .
that guy , he , um ...
... did some bad stuff to callie .
and you just had to jump in to defend her .
i &apos;m kidding . i &apos;m sure you had your reasons .
you &apos;re pretty rock @-@ n @-@ roll , foster .
i mean , you &apos;re an idiot , but ... come on .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just kind of in a bad place right now . i can &apos;t .
it &apos;s not you , ok ?
and it &apos;s not callie .
it &apos;s me .
i promise . i &apos;m sorry .
let &apos;s get outta here .
callie ! hey !
what ? what did i do ?
i was just trying to protect you .
i know .
then what did i do wrong ?
that &apos;s not the kind of protection i want , wyatt .
i told you , ok ? i needed you today .
i needed you . to be with me .
i told myself that i could trust you but i guess i was wrong .
you know how i feel about violence ,
or do you not remember me screaming at you
the last time that you picked a fight with liam .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re having this fight again .
i was ...
i was just trying to take care of you , callie .
well , maybe you don &apos;t know how to do that .
oh , god !
hey honey .
i &apos;m just calling to say that i got you video .
i sent it ?
yeah , i called the plumber . he &apos;s on the way .
ok , thank you .
hey , are you ok ?
i miss the baby .
we didn &apos;t even know her and i miss her so much .
i know , me too .
thanks for the heads up .
what the hell happened ?
that hurts .
it &apos;s supposed to hurt .
what are you doin &apos; , getting in fights , anyway ?
your hand just got better ...
i know , i know . i was trying to stop it , honest .
but ...
... once i saw liam , i got so mad , i ...
i couldn &apos;t .
who you really mad at , b ? liam ?
sure , maybe .
he deserves some anger , but i gotta say ,
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s really what this was about .
i think you &apos;re mad at me .
and i think you &apos;re mad at yourself .
i want you to forgive yourself for what happened with dani .
and i want you to forgive me for
bringing her into our lives in the first place .
i &apos;m so sorry , dad .
i know you are .
i &apos;m sorry , too .
you can &apos;t avoid hurting the people you love .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s just what happens .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s family .
but i got a feeling we &apos;re gonna be
making amends to each other for the rest of our lives .
the only thing that matters is we keep doing it .
no , that can &apos;t have been fun , seeing liam .
you all right , my love ?
and wyatt , how is he ?
um , a little bruised but he &apos;ll be fine .
i get that he was just trying to protect me , but another fight ?
what good is that gonna do anyone , you know ?
you &apos;re so amazing , you know that ? you come here .
you and me , we &apos;re a lot alike .
we think we gotta be strong , tough ,
think we gotta get on with things and ...
you know , sometimes you do
and sometimes ...
sometimes , you just gotta let yourself fall apart .
and there &apos;s no shame in that . not even a little .
mariana , is that you ?
nope , it &apos;s just me .
oh . where you been all day ?
just out with hayley .
have you talked with your sister ?
mariana ? no , why ?
i &apos;ll talk to you about it later .
ok . i should get back to that paper i was working on .
yeah , you should . you been talking about that all day .
what am i gonna do with him ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know either .
i don &apos;t hate being latin .
i mean , how could you ?
i just ...
ana &apos;s the only connection i have to being mexican , you know ?
and i hate her so much .
if you knew half of what she &apos;s done to my family ...
i just think today , you know , seeing all of this ,
it just reminded me of her ,
the part of me that makes me feel so awful about myself .
i &apos;m sorry i was such a bitch today .
no .
remember when i told you how my dad left when i was six ?
well , my mom always used to tell us
it had nothing to do with us ,
that he was a total mess with a ton of problems .
but even so ,
i still can &apos;t believe he &apos;s never called ,
he &apos;s never come by ,
not even to make sure we were alive , you know ?
i shouldn &apos;t care but ...
... i just think if ...
... if i could hear him say i &apos;m sorry ...
... just once , that would be something , you know ?
hey . how was it ?
good . it was good .
mike stopped by and he said that he ran into you .
and he was with ana .
did she really send you a letter ,
asking if she could see us ?
she did .
well i want to .
see her .
