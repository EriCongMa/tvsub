oh , you know , monica &apos;s gonna freak if every box isn &apos;t labeled .
you &apos;re right , yeah . okay ..
&quot; box of crap . &quot;
it &apos;s so wild . when monica and chandler come back , they are gonna have a baby .
a baby !
i know .
wait . ross doesn &apos;t know the baby &apos;s coming .
should we call and tell him ?
i don &apos;t know . rachel &apos;s still there yelling at him .
poor guy . i would not wanna be him right now .
wait . wait . should we be doing this ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s probably not a really good idea .
yeah , probably not .
well , that never stopped us before .
no , sir !
the.last.one
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re gonna be parents soon .
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s three weeks early .
i love that our baby is prompt .
okay . all right , what room did the nurse say erica was in ?
702 .
okay .
come on , baby .
come on . you can do this .
get this damn thing out of me !
well , these are for you .
did you see the size of the thing that was coming out of that woman ?
i couldn &apos;t tell who was giving birth to who .
hi .
hey . how &apos;s it going ?
it &apos;s okay . the doctor says it &apos;ll still be a while .
how do you feel ?
well , it hurts sometimes .
not too bad yet , though . it &apos;s a little scary .
oh , i know . but , honey , you &apos;re gonna be fine .
tell that to the lady in 702 with the toddler coming out of her .
i think that kid was wearing a shirt .
you &apos;re gonna be fine , though .
hey .
go back to sleep . i have to go home .
oh , god . this was amazing .
it really was .
you &apos;ve learned some new moves .
yeah , well , this guy at work gave me sex for dummies as a joke .
who &apos;s laughing now ?
i am .
breathe . breathe . breathe .
okay . good .
next time , can i say &quot; breathe &quot; ?
no . last time , you said it like dracula , and it scared her .
do you want some more ice chips ?
no , i &apos;m okay .
all right . i &apos;ll be right back .
where you going ?
to use the bathroom .
you can &apos;t leave me alone with her .
what ?
this is exactly the kind of social situation ..
that i am not comfortable with .
what kind of social situation are you comfortable with ?
it &apos;s just that we &apos;ve never spent any time , you know , alone together .
you &apos;ll be fine . you won &apos;t , but i &apos;ll be back in two minutes .
okay .
so any plans for the summer ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe church camp .
may not want to mention this .
so you ever wonder which is worse ?
you know , going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts ?
what ?
oh , it &apos;s just interesting .
because no one will ever know because no one can experience both .
one of life &apos;s great unanswerable questions .
who knows ? maybe there &apos;s something even more painful than those things .
like this .
come in .
morning .
hey .
what &apos;s that ?
oh , it &apos;s my housewarming present for monica and chandler .
that &apos;s a baby chick and duck .
and i named them chick jr. and duck jr .
i did not see that coming .
they &apos;ll love it at that new house . it has that big backyard .
when they &apos;re old , they &apos;ll go to that farm ..
that chandler took the other chick and duck to .
yes .
yeah .
it &apos;s a shame people can &apos;t visit there .
that is the rule though .
guess what . you &apos;re almost an uncle .
what ?
erica went into labor . monica and chandler are at the hospital right now .
oh , my god !
i have a feeling it &apos;s gonna be a girl .
phoebe , you were sure ben was gonna be a girl .
have you seen him throw a ball ?
is rachel here ?
i think she &apos;s still asleep .
how did it go with you guys last night ? she seemed pretty pissed at you .
we worked things out .
what &apos;s that smile ? did something happen with you two ?
hey , i &apos;m not one to kiss and tell .
but i &apos;m also not one to have sex and shut up . we totally did it .
oh , my god . you and rachel ?
i know , it &apos;s pretty great .
so , what does that mean ?
are you guys getting back together ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
we didn &apos;t really get to talk .
but do you want to get back together ?
i don &apos;t know .
it was incredible . i mean , it just felt so right .
when i was holding her , i mean , i never wanted to let her go .
know what ? yeah , i do . i want to be together .
so is she still going to paris ?
wow , i hadn &apos;t thought of that . i hope not .
this is , like , the best day ever . ever . you guys might get back together .
monica and chandler get their baby . there are chicks and ducks ..
in the world again .
i feel like i &apos;m in a musical .
morning .
guess you &apos;ll never know how it ends .
hey .
hi .
hi . how &apos;d you sleep ?
good . you ?
good .
i &apos;ll bet you did .
would you guys mind giving us a minute ?
sure . just keep an eye on the chick and duck .
chick and the duck ? didn &apos;t they die .. ?
dive . yeah , they dove . headfirst into fun on the farm .
so ..
morning .
you too .
last night was just wonderful .
oh , it really was .
i woke up today with the biggest smile .
i know , me too . it was ..
you know , it was one of those things you think is never going to happen .
and then it does , and it &apos;s everything you want it to be .
i know . it was just ..
it &apos;s just the perfect way to say goodbye .
just a little bit more , honey .
oh , man , this hurts !
is it really that bad ?
i think it &apos;s time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse .
the baby &apos;s head is crowning .
oh , my god ! that is the most beautiful top of a head i have ever seen .
chandler , you have to see this .
i &apos;m okay .
you don &apos;t want to miss this . this is the birth of your child .
it &apos;s the miracle of life .
all right .
wow , that is one disgusting miracle .
start pushing . here we go .
here come the shoulders .
it &apos;s a boy .
is he okay ?
he &apos;s just fine .
you did it .
it &apos;s a baby .
a beautiful little baby . and some other stuff i &apos;m gonna pretend i don &apos;t see .
would you like to cut the umbilical cord ?
okay .
well , that &apos;s spongy .
hey , handsome .
i &apos;ll love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you .
we are so lucky .
i know .
he has your eyes .
i mean , i know that &apos;s not possible , but he does .
we &apos;ll just get him cleaned up a bit .
oh , my god , he &apos;s beautiful .
thank you so much .
i &apos;m really happy for you guys .
how do you feel ?
i &apos;m tired .
you don &apos;t have that much time to relax . the other one will be along in a minute .
i &apos;m sorry , who should be along in a what , now ?
the next baby should be along in a minute .
we only ordered one .
you know it &apos;s twins , right ?
oh , yeah .
these are the faces of two people in the know .
i can &apos;t believe you didn &apos;t know it &apos;s twins . this has never happened before .
well , gosh . that makes me feel so special and good .
did you know it was twins ?
it &apos;s here in the paperwork we got from the clinic .
did anybody tell you ?
i don &apos;t think so .
they did mention two heartbeats , but i thought it was just mine and the baby &apos;s .
they said , &quot; both heartbeats are strong . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s good , because i &apos;m having a baby . &quot;
this is unbelievable .
twins actually run in my family .
interesting .
can i see you for a second ?
what do we do ?
what do you mean , &quot; what do we do ? &quot;
twins !
twins !
chandler , you &apos;re panicking .
join me , won &apos;t you ?
what do you say we keep one and then just have an option on the other one ?
we can &apos;t split them up .
why not ?
we could give each of them half a medallion .
and then years later , they &apos;ll find each other ..
and be reunited . i mean , that &apos;s a great day for everybody .
what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible ?
what if they &apos;re not ? what if it &apos;s adopted by a king ?
yeah . because i hear the king is looking to adopt .
monica , we are not ready to have two babies .
that doesn &apos;t matter . we have waited so long for this .
i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s two babies . i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s three babies .
i don &apos;t care if the entire cast of eight is enough comes out of there .
we are taking them home because they are our children .
okay .
okay .
okay !
okay .
it looks like we &apos;re about ready over here . come on , erica .
start pushing again now .
here she comes .
she ? it &apos;s a girl ?
yeah .
well , now we have one of each .
and that &apos;s enough .
and then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye .
oh , my god . what did you say ?
nothing . what do you say to that ?
you &apos;ve got to tell her how you feel .
no way .
well , you can &apos;t just give up .
is that what a dinosaur would do ?
what ?
i &apos;m just trying to speak your language .
ross , rachel doesn &apos;t know that you even wanna get back together .
if she did , she might feel differently . she might not even go .
you really think so ?
i &apos;m telling you !
oh , this is the part of the musical where there &apos;d be a good , convincing song .
hi .
can &apos;t a girl finish a song around here ?
hey .
hi . i dropped emma off at my mom &apos;s .
okay .
you &apos;re not taking her tonight ?
we decided i &apos;d set up , then my mom would bring emma to paris on sunday .
eight @-@ hour flight with a baby . good luck , mom .
you kidding ? eight hours with my mom talking about atkins . good luck , emma .
all right . you know what ? you &apos;re right . i should at least tell her how i feel .
ross . wait , wait .
what ? what ?
could you get me a muffin ?
rachel ?
yeah ?
i know you &apos;re leaving tonight , but i just have to tell you .
i love you .
now , i don &apos;t know if that changes your plans at all .
but i thought you should know .
gunther .
i love you too . probably not in the same way .
but i do . and when i &apos;m in a cafe having coffee ..
or i see a man with hair brighter than the sun ..
i &apos;ll think of you .
bye , you guys .
bye .
oh , my god !
unbelievable .
hey , you know what might help ?
i &apos;m not getting you a muffin !
do you think they recognize each other from in there ?
maybe . unless they &apos;re like people who &apos;ve lived in apartments ..
next to each other for years , then one day they &apos;re pushed through a vagina ..
and they meet .
we &apos;re going to take erica to recovery now .
there &apos;s something that we wanted to tell you .
we decided to name the girl baby erica .
oh , my god , that &apos;s just like my name !
son of a gun , it is .
anyway , i &apos;m gonna go get some rest .
i &apos;m really glad i picked you guys . you &apos;re gonna make great parents .
even chandler .
okay , well , bye .
bye .
we &apos;ll call you .
okay .
have fun at church camp .
look at these little bunnies .
i know .
you ready to trade ?
okay .
okay .
okay . let &apos;s see .
we could trade later .
yeah , i &apos;m good .
hey , what are you working on ?
a &quot; welcome home &quot; sign for the baby .
how sweet ! oh , is that the baby ?
no , i sat in the paint .
hey .
so did you talk to rachel ?
no . and i &apos;m not going to .
what ?
why not ?
she &apos;s just gonna shoot me down .
you saw what happened with gunther . that did not look like fun .
how can you compare yourself to gunther ?
i mean , sure , he &apos;s sexy in a more obvious way .
you have a relationship with her . you slept together last night .
yeah , and she still wants to go . it &apos;s pretty clear where she is .
i know what you mean . i mean , sometimes ..
joe .
damn it !
if i were gonna tell her , i don &apos;t have to do it now .
okay ? i &apos;ll be seeing her again . we &apos;ve got time .
no , you don &apos;t . she &apos;s going to paris ! she is going to meet somebody .
do you know how many hot guys there are in paris ? it &apos;s a city of gunthers .
hey .
hey .
what do you have there ?
oh , i made a little something .
if i had more time to work on it , it &apos;d be better , but ..
oh , my god , you did that yourself ?
honey , that &apos;s gorgeous .
you know , the baby can &apos;t read , mike .
hi . the car service just got here . i can &apos;t believe they &apos;re not home yet !
i have to catch my stupid plane . i want to see the baby .
monica just called from the cab . she said they should be here any minute .
apparently , there &apos;s some big surprise .
yeah , did she sound happy about it ?
because my friend ethel &apos;s baby was born with a teeny @-@ tiny beard .
welcome home .
oh , my god .
oh , my gosh .
hey .
hey .
hey , so , what is the big surprise ?
oh , my god !
how did this .. ?
okay , awkward question . the hospital knows you took two , right ?
yes . it &apos;s twins .
oh , my .. they are so cute .
now , what kinds are they ?
this is a boy . and that &apos;s a girl .
her name is erica .
hey , that pregnant girl &apos;s name was erica .
yeah . it &apos;s a shame you two didn &apos;t get to spend more time together .
yeah , and we named the boy jack , after dad .
he &apos;s gonna be so happy .
jack bing . i love that .
it sounds like a &apos; 40s newspaper guy . you know , &quot; jack bing , morning gazette .
i &apos;m gonna blow this story wide open . &quot;
oh , my gosh .
so beautiful .
i want one .
oh , yeah ? well , tell me which one . i &apos;ll try to slip it in my coat .
seriously . i mean , you want to make one of those ?
one ? how about a whole bunch ?
really ?
yeah . we can teach them to sing , and we could be like the von trapp family .
only without the nazis . although that sounds kind of dull .
i can &apos;t believe this . if i don &apos;t leave now , i &apos;m gonna miss my plane .
i &apos;m so glad you got to see the babies .
me too .
i &apos;m just sorry i &apos;m not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this .
all right . oh , i can &apos;t say goodbye to you guys again .
i love you all so much .
love you .
we love you .
call us when you get there .
i will . ross , come here .
i just want you to know ..
last night ..
i &apos;ll never forget it .
neither will i.
all right . now i really have to go .
okay , au revoir .
they &apos;re gonna really hate me over there .
so you just let her go ?
yeah .
hey , maybe that &apos;s for the best .
yeah ?
yeah . you know , you just .. look , you gotta ..
you gotta think about last night the way she does .
okay ? you know , maybe ..
maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye .
they slept together ?
i was with you .
now she &apos;ll never know how he feels .
maybe that &apos;s okay , you know ?
maybe it is better this way .
i mean , now .. now you can move on .
i mean , you &apos;ve been trying to for so long .
maybe now that you &apos;re on different continents ..
right ?
maybe now you can actually do it , you know .
you can finally get over her .
yeah , that &apos;s true .
except ..
i don &apos;t want to get over her .
what ?
i don &apos;t . i want to be with her .
really ?
yeah . i &apos;m going to go after her .
yeah , you are !
wait ! wait ! get your coat ! get your coat !
my coat .
this is so cool !
i have no idea what &apos;s going on , but i am excited !
what do you think she &apos;s gonna say ?
i don &apos;t know .
even if she shoots me down , at least i won &apos;t spend my life wondering ..
what would have happened . where is my coat ?
you didn &apos;t bring one ! my cab &apos;s downstairs . i &apos;ll drive you to the airport .
wish me luck .
hurry !
good luck !
oh , my god .
ross is going after rachel . and you guys have babies .
this is , like , the best day ever !
why is there an ass @-@ shaped paint stain on my couch ?
she asked you a question , mike .
you really think we &apos;ll make it in time ?
hey , i didn &apos;t have my license taken away because i drive carefully .
there &apos;s no seat belts !
that &apos;s okay . if we hit anything ..
the engine will explode , so it &apos;s better if you &apos;re thrown from the car .
all right , all right . let &apos;s do this .
okay !
hey !
80th and east end .
no . i don &apos;t take passengers .
the law makes you accept any fare .
you don &apos;t understand . this cab isn &apos;t real .

you should have thought of that before you got in !
tollbooth .
what ?
tollbooth !

for your housewarming gift , i got you a baby chick and a baby duck .
really ? you got us a chick and a duck ?
oh , great . just what you want for a new house with infants . bird feces !
but they must &apos;ve jumped off the table . now they &apos;re gone !
don &apos;t worry , we &apos;ll find them .
actually , i &apos;m gonna go check on the twins .
oh , god ! what did i just step on ?
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s just an egg roll .
you stepped on my egg roll ? !
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t know to look for chinese food on the floor .
just put it on a plate and leave .
okay . let &apos;s find these birds .
all right .
wait , wait . you hear that ?
they &apos;re in the table !
well , that can &apos;t be good .
we gotta get them out of there !
how ?
maybe we can lure them out . you know any birdcalls ?
oh , tons . i &apos;m quite the woodsman .
well , maybe we can just tip the table a little .
joey , wait ! the ball !
so , what do we do ?
maybe we can open this up somehow .
okay .
no . it &apos;s all glued together .
does that mean we have to bust it open ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe .
oh , my god .
i know . it &apos;s .. it &apos;s the foosball table .
all right , you know what ? we don &apos;t have a choice .
it &apos;s like i would have said in that sci @-@ fi movie if i &apos;d have gotten the part .
those are our men in there , and we have to get them out ..
even if i have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life ..
my time machine .
did that movie ever get made ?
it did not .
ross , where are you going ?
to talk to rachel .
isn &apos;t that why we took a ride in the death cab ?
you &apos;re walking up to her at the gate ?
have you never chased anyone through the airport before ?
not since my cop show got canceled .
you have to get a ticket to get past security .
what ? we &apos;re never gonna make it .
not with that attitude . now , haul ass !
okay , if you could all walk slower , that &apos;d be great .
madame , your passport , please .

i am not doing this over the phone .
you don &apos;t have any other choice .
hello ?
rachel . oh , good .
by the way , did you just get on the plane ?
yeah .
we would have caught her ..
if we were at the right airport .
rachel , hang on .
no . no . no .
phoebe , is everything okay ?
actually , no . no . you have to get off the plane .
what ? why ?
i have this feeling that ..
something &apos;s wrong with it . something is wrong with the left phalange .
oh , honey , i &apos;m sure there &apos;s nothing wrong with the plane .
look , i have to go . i love you , and l will call you the minute i get to paris .
what was that ?
oh , that was just my crazy friend .
she told me to get off the plane because she had a &quot; feeling &quot; that there ..
was something wrong with the left phalange .
okay . that doesn &apos;t sound good .
oh , i wouldn &apos;t worry about it .
she comes up with this stuff , and she &apos;s almost never right .
but she is sometimes .
well ..
what are you doing ?
i can &apos;t take this plane now .
excuse me , sir . where are you going ?
i have to get off this plane .
her friend has a feeling something &apos;s wrong with the left phalange .
could i get some peanuts ?
what &apos;s wrong with the plane ?
there &apos;s nothing wrong .
the left phalange .
there &apos;s no &quot; phalange . &quot;
oh , my god . this plane doesn &apos;t even have a phalange .
i &apos;m not flying on it .
please sit down .
what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;re getting off . there is no phalange !
this is ridiculous . i ..
yeah , okay .
all right . my job here is done .
that was impressive .
yeah . you didn &apos;t even use the tools for most of it .
yeah , they were just slowing me down .
all right . i gotta get back to the babies . see you girls later .
sorry about the table , man .
yeah .
you gonna buy a new one ?
probably not . no .
i don &apos;t know how much i &apos;m gonna want to play after you go .
at least we got these little guys out .
yeah .
we were worried about you .
i guess i better get used to things crapping in my hand , huh ?
i &apos;m gonna miss these little guys .
it was nice having birds around again .
hey , you know what ? maybe we should keep them here with you .
what ?
yeah . we got a lot going on right now .
and plus , here , they &apos;d have their own room .
i could get a goose !
you know , i think you &apos;re set with the poultry .
thanks , man . you hear that , you guys ?
you &apos;re gonna get to stay here . and it &apos;s good ..
you know , because ..
because now you have a reason to come visit .
i think there may be another reason .
so ..
awkward hug or lame cool @-@ guy handshake ?
yeah , well , you know , lame cool @-@ guy handshake .
ma &apos;am , i assure you , the plane is fine .
and you fixed the phalange ?
yes . the phalange &apos;s fixed .
in fact , we &apos;ve put a whole lot of extra phalanges onboard , just in case .
where is she ?

look around , you guys . this was your first home .
and it was a happy place , filled with love and laughter .
but more important , because of rent control , it was a frigging steal .

oh , yeah . that &apos;s true .
i haven &apos;t .
what about that summer during college that you lived with grandma ..
and you tried to make it as a dancer ?
