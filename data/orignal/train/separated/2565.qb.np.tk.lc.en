07 a.m. examiner hatch .
subject -- elizabeth scott keen .
here we go .
before monday of last week ,
did you have , or have you ever had ,
personal contact with raymond reddington ?
no .
did reddington notify you
before he surrendered himself to the fbi ?
no .
have you ever been convicted of a crime ?
convicted ? not yet .
please answer &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no . &quot;
have you ever been convicted of a crime ?
you &apos;re wasting valuable time .
does elizabeth keen know why you surrendered yourself ?
he &apos;s telling our people he wants immunity ,
that he &apos;s willing to cooperate , give us names .
what names ?
he &apos;s got a list ,
alleges he can deliver us high @-@ value criminal targets
if the justice department grants him immunity .
what &apos;s his legal status ?
the man sold secrets to the hofstad network , to the syrians .
he &apos;s not getting immunity .
talk to me about containment .
who knows we &apos;ve got him ?
including us in this room ... a total of 26 people .
remember , he &apos;s been off the grid for over 20 years .
yet he seems to know things even you don &apos;t .
about this , uh , elizabeth keen --
says her father has some kind of criminal record ?
yes .
before monday of last week ,
did you have , or have you ever had ,
personal contact with elizabeth keen ?
no .
he &apos;s lying .
does raymond reddington know ,
or has he ever known , your husband ?
his name &apos;s tom keen . school teacher , 4th grade .
he &apos;s currently in a medically induced coma ,
was nearly killed last week during an altercation
on a case keen was working .
he gonna survive ?
the situation is uncertain .
you &apos;re confident that the husband &apos;s
not involved with reddington ?
no .
the truth is we don &apos;t have any idea
who reddington may be involved with .
then why should we trust him ?
you &apos;re asking the wrong questions .
i &apos;m trying to help you with a matter of some urgency .
it &apos;s your choice whether you listen to me or not ,
but there will be an incident at 11 : 00 this morning
at the decatur industrial park .
i would send ambulances .
we need to move quickly .
he &apos;s a prisoner .
he has no legal position to negotiate from .
charge him under the patriot act .
see what he has to say then .
he &apos;ll only speak with keen .
it &apos;s not up to him . we decide who he speaks --
i don &apos;t think you understand
how delicately the situation needs to be handled .
reddington has brokered some of the most comprehensive
international criminal activity in the past 20 years .
he has access to targets we don &apos;t even know exist .
now , he &apos;s telling us there may be some kind of an event
about to happen at the decatur industrial park .
i don &apos;t think you understand .
you don &apos;t run the criminal division of main justice . i do .
the attorney general is not going to accept a deal .
reddington is a criminal ,
and we &apos;re gonna take credit for catching him .
our office will lay out the charges .
i hope you understand that from time t--
there is ... no ... deal .
am i clear ?
yes .
and have you been truthful
to the best of your knowledge ?
so , what do we got ?
swept the entire yard .
got multiple teams working the property , k @-@ 9 units .
nothing . i mean , look around .
i got two city blocks of hiding places ,
and i don &apos;t even know what the hell
i &apos;m supposed to be looking for .
i need more information . what &apos;s the specific tip ?
who did it come from ?
we got an informant who &apos;s dicking us around .
says we &apos;re gonna need rescue units here at 11 : 00 .
it &apos;s already 11 : 20 .
give it another 20 minutes and wrap it up .
i want bomb squads , medics . i want everybody out .
we &apos;ve got a problem .
a passenger train just blew through .
come again ? what was that ?
i said you have a passenger train
coming in your direction .
it &apos;s over speed .
clear the area . get everyone out .
clear ! clear out !
get your men out of here ! clear !
those things i found under the floor ,
they &apos;re not yours , right ?
he put them there --
the gun and the passports .
tell me reddington did this , and not ...
i wish you were here so you could explain yourself .
60 people have been confirmed dead
and dozens injured after a passenger train derailed
this morning at the decatur industrial park .
60 people are dead because of you .
60 people are dead
because you don &apos;t return my calls , harold .
if you want to save lives and catch the bad guys ,
pay attention .
they &apos;re not going to make your deal .
that &apos;s unfortunate .
the next name on my list is an absolute snake .
the train . how did you know ?
i know lots of things . but the train i didn &apos;t .
i knew the time , the place ,
but the train was a big surprise .
we &apos;ve ruled out terrorism .
look at the list of casualties , harold .
you &apos;ll find some councilwoman from albany .
apparently she &apos;s been tangling
with some rather cunning , powerful people .
you &apos;re saying the derailment was an assassination ?
i &apos;m not saying anything ...
unless it &apos;s to elizabeth keen .
tell me about the train wreck .
if you had any idea how far i &apos;ve traveled
to see you again , lizzy .
my name &apos;s &quot; liz , &quot; not &quot; lizzy . &quot;
to you , i &apos;m agent keen .
now , i &apos;ve heard all your demands ,
but i don &apos;t think you &apos;ve heard mine ,
so let me tell you how this is gonna work .
i ask the questions , you answer them .
screw with me , and i walk .
understood ?
how is tom ?
they &apos;re never gonna give you immunity .
not a chance .
oh , i think they will .
otherwise , what am i doing here ?
i &apos;m perfectly happy to go back to the boat .
tell me about the train wreck .
what would you like to know ?
everything .
the train accident was no accident . you know that .
but what you don &apos;t know is the man behind it ...
is quite prolific .
he &apos;s responsible for a slew
of other premeditated killings
just like this one , disguised as accidents .
shall i go on ?
a building collapses in moscow ,
a ferry capsizes on the brahmaputra river .
these are the events we &apos;ve come to expect
on the evening news .
but in truth , there &apos;s always more to the story .
hidden between the facts and figures ,
the victims and the heroes , there &apos;s always a murder .
the work of a man who disguises his killings
in the headlines of everyday tragedies .
what proof do you have ?
his work is difficult to detect ,
but the victims are there .
an appellate court judge in ohio ,
a french diplomat who dies in a plane crash .
look closer . the pattern will emerge .
over the last seven years ,
more than 3,000 innocent civilians have died ,
all collateral victims
as a result of this man &apos;s unique methods .
in the 20 @-@ odd years
i &apos;ve been working my side of the tracks ,
i have not encountered another contractor
who &apos;s had as significant an impact
on the civilian population as he .
he &apos;s rivaled only by governments and terrorist organizations .
and you &apos;ve never heard of him .
i have it on good authority
that his next contract will take him to new york .
this is not an opportunity to ponder or deliberate ,
because once he &apos;s done , he &apos;s gone .
this guy have a name ?
they call him &quot; the freelancer . &quot;
and how do we find him ?
you don &apos;t find him . i do .
what , are you two pen pals ?
you guys send each other , uh , coded e @-@ mails ?
i don &apos;t have e @-@ mail or a phone
or ... an address .
i prefer to handle my business face @-@ to @-@ face .
you &apos;ve met him .
once .
i brokered a few jobs .
he works through an intermediary .
he might be for sale .
perhaps i should set a meeting .
maybe you should .
you should come .
just the two of us -- no wires ,
no clumsy agents in the bushes .
you want me to make an introduction ,
you need to trust me with my source .
ah ! what fun ! you &apos;ll need a dress .
and where would this meeting be ?
montreal .
what do you know about the passports ?
what passports ?
you know what i &apos;m talking about .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , you put them there .
put what , lizzy ?
the box . the money and the gun . the passports .
who else have you told ?
what ? nobody .
have you told cooper ?
no .
i want you to shadow reddington to montreal .
contact our people in the royal canadian mounted police .
i want complete surveillance .
take them both down -- reddington and his liaison .
if you go to the police , they &apos;ll file charges .
if the gun &apos;s not registered , it &apos;s a felony .
the passports are 25 years each .
on the other hand ,
if you confront him , what good does that do ?
he &apos;ll deny everything ,
and you &apos;ll continue to doubt him .
either way , it &apos;s ...
an impossible situation .
before we do this , let me be clear --
i &apos;m not here to socialize .
i have no interest in having dinner with you ,
nor do we have the time .
we meet your contact .
we get the name of the freelancer &apos;s next victim ,
and we go . understood ?
i agree with you completely ,
but it is a restaurant , and it is dinnertime .
so , what does this liaison look like ?
let &apos;s not get ahead of ourselves .
bonsoir . ca va ?
anyone asks ,
you &apos;re my girlfriend from ann arbor .
absolutely not .
fine . you can be my daughter .
bonsoir .
what would you like to drink ?
i &apos;ll have wine . chardonnay ?
s &apos;il vous plait , pour madame ,
un cocktail de l &apos;aviation .
this one . here . bring that up .
running facial recognition now .
no hits off the database yet .
oh , this isn &apos;t what i ordered .
merci .
to the future .
aviation cocktail .
it &apos;s from the &apos; 20s .
tastes like spring , doesn &apos;t it ?
tell me about your job .
the profiling .
i &apos;m fascinated .
how close to the truth do you think you can really get ?
where &apos;s your contact ?
tell me my profile .
why would i do that ?
you &apos;ve heard the debriefs .
you &apos;ve read ressler &apos;s book reports .
i so want to know how you ... see things .
you &apos;re a loner . you keep your distance .
you travel freely through foreign lands .
you &apos;re rootless .
you &apos;re very comfortable here with your glass of scotch ,
but you &apos;re just as comfortable sleeping in a cave with rebels
or sharing dinner in some hole @-@ in @-@ the @-@ wall noodle shop .
your closest friends are strangers .
you understand that tight bonds can make you vulnerable ,
so you &apos;re careful not to have any .
and that &apos;s why you &apos;re so conflicted about me .
you need me .
and you hate that about yourself ,
because it makes you vulnerable .
tell me about your husband .
does he know you as well as you know him ?
your contact is late .
does he know about you as a child ?
it &apos;s been 35 minutes .
does he know about the fire ?
why am i so important to you ?
did you know my parents ?
i asked you a question .
oui , monsieur ?
s &apos;il vous plait , apportez @-@ nous une bouteille
quatre vingt deux chateau latour .
bonsoir .
are you gonna keep trying to impress me
with your knowledge of french wine ,
or are you gonna answer my question ?
what if i were to tell you ...
that all the things you &apos;ve come to believe about yourself
are a lie ?
please excuse me for a moment .

what the hell was that ? you sold him out .
you let him go .
i let him go ? ! who notified rcmp ? !
you compromised an asset .
he &apos;s number 4 on the most wanted list , keen .
what did you expect ? !
and now he &apos;s gone because of you !
hey , there , guys .
you planned this ! you knew he would never show !
take a breath , agent ressler .
you think i &apos;m gonna fly all the way to montreal
for the cheese cart ?
my contact was the first person i saw
when i walked into the place .
i told you he would help , and he did .
the coat @-@ check attendant .
i left payment in my hat .
in exchange , he left a photo
of the assassin &apos;s next victim .
floriana campo .
the human @-@ rights activist ?
there you have it --
a solid lead delivered exactly as promised .
find floriana campo ,
you find the freelancer .
not bad for a day &apos;s work . let &apos;s celebrate .
hey , donald . how &apos; bout that cheese cart ?
floriana campo ?
donald ressler . elizabeth keen . fbi .
we need to have a word with you .
we have reason to believe someone &apos;s planning
an assassination attempt on your life .
tonight &apos;s fundraiser needs to be canceled .
oh , it can &apos;t be canceled .
it &apos;s a donor event , and i have my own security .
it &apos;s too risky .
we can &apos;t guarantee your safety .
nobody can guarantee my safety .
i have many enemies -- traffickers , cartels .
we know what they did to your husband ,
what you &apos;ve gone through .
your work , it &apos;s been an inspiration .
i wrote my senior thesis on your time in kuala lumpur .
i was going through a very bad time .
and in some ways , i think you helped me through it .
do you have children , agent keen ?
uh , elizabeth .
and ... if all goes well ...
there is no work more meaningful than being a mother .
i didn &apos;t have kids of my own . this is my one regret .
but these girls that i &apos;m trying to protect ,
they are my family .
tonight is for them . i won &apos;t cancel .
look , we can &apos;t force you to accept our protection ,
but we need your help to find the man contracted to kill you .
to identify him , to capture him ,
we need you to cooperate -- you &apos;re our only link .
will you help us ?
she spent 15 years with the u.n. ,
stationed primarily in eastern europe
with small stints in north africa .
in 2000 , she helped pass
the trafficking victims protection act .
since that time ,
her nonprofit has raised over $ 35 million
in her campaign to eliminate human and sex trafficking
around the globe .
three years ago , her husband was murdered
by the eberhardt cartel .
eberhardt is the most ruthless
human @-@ trafficking cartel in europe .
2008 , their founder was killed leaving a power vacuum .
to this day , nobody knows who &apos;s actually running the outfit .
what we do know is that he &apos;s merciless .
murdered rival cartel leaders to expand his reach .
survivors tell stories of torture and forced addiction .
he killed floriana campo &apos;s husband ,
and he most likely hired the freelancer to kill her .
we &apos;re doing everything we can to disrupt the freelancer &apos;s plan .
we &apos;ve changed schedules , travel routes .
and you &apos;ve moved tomorrow night &apos;s event ?
yes , based on what we know about the freelancer ,
he takes months to plan these attacks .
if he had something planned for tomorrow ,
he &apos;s gonna need to pass through our security
in order to pull it off .
what good does that do if nobody knows what he looks like ?
i need your help .
you said you &apos;ve seen this guy once .
we &apos;re compiling photos of the people who are scheduled
to attend the event tomorrow , and --
please understand
i want more than anything to help you .
it &apos;s the reason why i &apos;m here .
but i won &apos;t say another word
until the terms of my deal are met .
i &apos;m so sorry to bother you with these trivial details ,
but it &apos;s a simple yes or no .
no .
his lawyers drafted this ?
no . he did .
reddington represents himself in legal matters .
a darpa @-@ tested , fully encrypted , 8 @-@ millimeter tag ?
i don &apos;t even know what that is .
it &apos;s a tracking device .
and what &apos;s this about his &quot; private security detail &quot; ?
he &apos;s given us a list of five names , wants us to pick two .
which are the two least offensive ?
ex @-@ freedom fighter from south sudan .
sources indicate he &apos;s reddington &apos;s former bodyguard ,
goes by the name of &quot; dembe . &quot;
does dembe have a last name ?
no , ma &apos;am . just dembe .
like prince or madonna .
the second is luli zeng . phd in economics from stanford .
dodged federal prison twice .
s.e.c. says she &apos;s untouchable .
we think she &apos;s moving reddington &apos;s money .
how would i justify this ?
you don &apos;t . it &apos;s off the books .
and he &apos;s what --
our informant , slowly working his way towards immunity ?
which he &apos;s never going to get .
we have a chance to catch a mass murderer .
one condition -- you bring in somebody i know and trust .
meera malik , c.i.a.
she can help navigate international waters .
fine .
one day , you and i will be talking about this moment
in front of a senate hearing .
god help us .
you got your deal . our turn now .
compiled a list of the attendees for tonight &apos;s event .
is this really the right approach ?
hey . i &apos;m right here . talk to me .
honestly , is this how the fbi does things --
comb through the invitation list ?
this guy didn &apos;t rsvp .
i &apos;ve seen the man .
if he shows up tonight ,
if you &apos;re going to have any hope of identifying him ,
you need to put me in that room .
so , you want to go to the party ?
oh , i thought you &apos;d never ask .
dembe .
luli , my dear .
raymond .
watch yourself with her , donald .
she hates men , and cops most of all .
you , i don &apos;t know .
meera malik .
you look like the c.i.a.
oh , yeah ? what &apos;s the c.i.a. look like ?
attractive but treacherous .
i guess we &apos;ll find out .
this is gonna be a gas .
♬ is everybody ready ? ♬
♬ yeah ! yeah ! yeah ! yeah ! ♬
♬ latin boogaloo is here ♬
♬ original brooklyn funk is in town ♬
♬ coming to you straight from the big apple ♬
so you know , the way this works ,
we don &apos;t typically drink on the job .
no , thank you .
your 7 o &apos;clock ?
no .
where &apos;s that woman with the mushroom puffs ?
you okay ?
oh , yes . i &apos;m fine . a wonderful evening .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i just got word that a shipment we were trying to track
has gone missing .
shipment ?
girls , more than 60 of them .
where ? there must be something the bureau can do .
oh , it &apos;s too late . they &apos;re gone .
ladies and gentlemen , if i may have your attention .
my name is anya kedrov .
i &apos;ve been asked to say a few words .
i spent three years of my life in a 9&apos;x9 &apos; room .
living in hell , forcibly addicted .
for all i survived , i still carry a daily reminder .
the people who took me , the eberhardt cartel ,
they brand their servants by carving their symbol
into the flesh on our backs .
but as bad as i had it ,
there is always someone who had it worse .
truth is , it &apos;s only through acknowledging
and claiming these experiences that we can really put a face
on the crime that is human sex trafficking .
tonight , i &apos;d simply like to say thank you .
thank you , floriana .
oh , thank you , anya .
and thank you for coming tonight .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve noticed we &apos;re not at the met .
we had to relocate for security reasons .
each one of you could have stayed home ,
succumbed to fear .
but you didn &apos;t .
you came . you &apos;re here .
you , i , anya stand here in solidarity ...
... with the people who cannot be here with us ...
yet .
it &apos;s him .
what ?
the waiter .
the freelancer .
clear the area .
now .
stop ! fbi !
federal agent !
clear the pool area !
it &apos;s the waiter ! he &apos;s heading towards the stairs !
stop !
watch out !
close the door !
we &apos;re heading east !
i repeat , heading east on 59th !
he &apos;s heading across town toward 63rd !
fbi . out of the car .
i &apos;m heading in your direction . give me an update .
200 west 57th . he &apos;s gonna be coming out the back .
my leg .
i need an ambulance .
well , i need names .
tell me about the eberhardt cartel .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
who &apos;s in charge of the cartel ?
who hired you to take out campo ?
sweep the floor . lock it down .
we &apos;re all clear inside .
he asked you a question .
i can &apos;t .
last time . who hired you ?
no !
my friend here is with the f.b.i.
i &apos;m from the c.i.a. you know the difference , don &apos;t you ?
now , we haven &apos;t got much time
because you have a compound fracture
and you &apos;re bleeding internally ,
so we &apos;re going to expedite things .
i can &apos;t .
a name .
reddington .
he hired me .
thank you .
for everything .
don &apos;t leave your suite .
it was reddington . he hired the freelancer .
what ? no . how could he ?
the coat @-@ check attendant . think about it .
the coat check didn &apos;t leave the picture in red &apos;s hat .
red left it for him .
he was signaling the hit .
why ?
couldn &apos;t get close enough to do it himself .
i have my own security .
so , you want to go to the party ?
oh , i thought you &apos;d never ask .
it &apos;s him , the waiter .
pointing out the freelancer was a diversion .
he wanted us to empty that party .
he wanted to get her alone .
how did you get in here ?
where &apos;s my security ?
your security is occupied .
this is because of you .
the threats , the fbi .
the fbi works for me now .
why are you doing this , raymond ?
i offered to make you a partner .
my people came to you about the shipping routes .
you turned us down .
i &apos;ve never liked you .
you never liked me
because you &apos;re a wanted man living in the shadows ,
and i am not .
i run my business ,
and i &apos;m being wined and dined by the city &apos;s elite .
i don &apos;t know how you do it--
the duplicity .
how does the devil in you contend with the angel ?
i would have kicked her out years ago .
you can learn a thing or two from me , raymond .
i &apos;m going to kiss that sweet ,
young fbi agent on the cheek and say , &quot; good night , &quot;
and then go down to docks
and pick up my next shipment of girls .
hey ! where &apos;s my agents ? !
get out of my way .
oh , elizabeth ! thank god you &apos;re here !
this is the man . he &apos;s the one who wants me dead .
you hired the freelancer . to do what ?
was it the champagne ? what &apos;s the headline gonna read ?
&quot; italian dog born with two heads . &quot;
no ?
how about &quot; humanitarian , exposed as fraud , commits suicide &quot; ?
what have you done ?
i didn &apos;t do anything .
i think the assassin may have slipped her a lethal cocktail
of the same barbiturates she uses to drug her children .
what are you saying ?
she &apos;s not the woman you think she is .
you &apos;re a liar .
who &apos;s lying , floriana ?
shut up , raymond !
ooh , that was a mistake .
you know him ?
everybody knows this son of a bitch !
i need a medic !
you don &apos;t need a medic . i have the antidote right here .
give it to me !
i &apos;d be happy to ,
as soon as she admits the truth .
give it to me now ! she &apos;s not breathing !
tell her the truth , floriana .
this will help you breathe .
madam campo doesn &apos;t free children from slavery .
she imprisons them .
i don &apos;t believe you .
don &apos;t be so naive .
floriana campo is the largest distributor
of enslaved children in the eastern hemisphere .
her foundation is a front to launder the profits
of the eberhardt cartel , which she runs .
she &apos;s been eliminating the competition .
good god . the woman had her own husband murdered .
give me the antidote .
all you have to do is tell her , floriana .
a simple nod will suffice .
what is with you in hotel rooms
and pens in people &apos;s necks ?
what &apos;s happening ?
looks like she &apos;s dying .
definitely dying .
you look tired .
go home . get some sleep .
unless you &apos;re avoiding your home .
what would you have done if the antidote had worked on time ?
it would have exposed you as our informant .
there was no antidote .
we &apos;ve confirmed that floriana campo
was running a fortune through the kowloon bank .
you were right .
the woman ran the eberhardt cartel .
based on the information you gave us ,
we were able to intercept the shipment and rescue the girls .
she preyed on the weak and the innocent
while dressed in the wings of a savior .
i detested everything about her .
i had no idea .
i mean , i just ...
i should have known .
we never really know anyone , do we ?
what are you gonna do , lizzy ?
about this situation with tom ?
it seems you have two options .
either you turn him in or confront him .
or perhaps there &apos;s a third option .

tell us a little about elizabeth .
elizabeth ? uh , to me , she &apos;s always just been lizzy .
uh , i remember the first time she brought up adoption
before we ever thought about coming to see you guys .
she was-- she was so nervous .
she tried to cook dinner , which was a complete disaster ,
because she &apos;s , uh , not the best cook .
i think it was around my third bite of cold spaghetti ,
she just started to cry .
i , uh-- i don &apos;t know .
i think she was afraid of disappointing me .
but she looked me in the eye , a @-@ and she told me the truth--
that she didn &apos;t want to have a biological child ,
not with so many children in need of a loving family .
she wanted to adopt .
it was important to her .
in that moment , i just ...
i @-@ i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever loved her more .
she &apos;s-- she &apos;s gonna be a great mom .
i mean , she really is .
i know that .
