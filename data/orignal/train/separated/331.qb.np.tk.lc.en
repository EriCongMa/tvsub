max , the guy is coming right now .
that &apos;s the first time anyone &apos;s ever
been polite enough to announce that to me .
yeah , hilarious , sex is messy .
now hurry !
let &apos;s get these cupcakes to the window before that guy gets here ,
and when he does , max ,
don &apos;t turn around .
why ?
you know why .
and here we are on the much traveled bedford street
right in the very heart of historic williamsburg .
this guy is so boring .
he &apos;s like a roofy with a little flag .
during the 1830s , german and austrian capitalists
established their businesses
here in historic williamsburg brooklyn .
and , in honor of those german and austrian founding fathers ,
here we have our williamsburg beer @-@ batter cupcake .
oof @-@ yah , beer batter ! it &apos;s good !
wow , you &apos;re pushing harder than i was
after i ate that whole brick of cheese .
soon , docks , shipyards , refineries , mills ,
and other booming businesses opened
along the growing waterfront .
businesses just like max &apos;s homemade cupcakes .
see , made in williamsburg .
only 12.95 , 100 % cotton .
and i &apos;m guessing cotton oof @-@ ya , ees good !
actually , i was referencing booming williamsburg businesses .
this is one of those small williamsburg businesses
that won &apos;t be here much longer .
follow me .
oh , sir , no ,
a free dessert comes with your end @-@ of @-@ tour meal
at the ye olde williamsburg watering hole restaurant .
don &apos;t waste your euros .
how dare he tell those people our business won &apos;t be here .
i haven &apos;t been this speechless since the first time
i saw your toe nails .
who cares what he thinks ?
we had such a good month , i had enough cash
to buy my own box of s &apos;mores pop @-@ tarts ,
a goal i &apos;ve had since i was 11 .
my other goal was making it to 12 .
by the way , you heard i referenced
the pop @-@ tarts as &quot; my own box , &quot; right ?
max , i &apos;m not interested in your box .
well , not for another ten years when we &apos;re still single .
i can &apos;t believe that tour guide
is telling people that our cupcake business is gonna fail .
i mean , it &apos;s one thing for you , me ,
and time out new york to say it , but ...
i just hate that tour guy .
i hate that tour guy too !
han , oh , my god !
it took us five years ,
but we finally have something in common .
that &apos;s not true . aren &apos;t you both an a @-@ cup ?
can you believe he &apos;s telling his entire tour
that our cupcake business is gonna fail ?
just to play devil &apos;s advocate ,
maybe he has the most basic understanding of supply and demand .
han , don &apos;t blow this ,
it might be our only connection ever .
who the hell does that dickweed think he is ?
exactly .
and i hate him because that tour never eats in here .
he just keeps pushing his stupid
ye olde williamsburg watering hole .
i don &apos;t want to hear anymore about that guy &apos;s hole !
until ten years from now when you &apos;re still single .
hey , everybody !
well , it happened .
ryan seacrest came out ?
oh , max , don &apos;t be silly .
no , i &apos;m pretty sure that happened a couple of years ago .
my biggest dream has come true .
kentucky fried chicken now comes
with free hair extensions ?
okay , my second biggest dream .
i &apos;m pregnant .
oh , no , everyone just thinks that
after they &apos;d had the chicken parmesan here .
it &apos;s not official . i haven &apos;t peed on a stick yet ,
but my boobs are really , really sore .
that could be my handy @-@ work , baby .
well , we &apos;re about to find out in a minute
&apos;cause i &apos;m about to go pee like a race whore .
sophie , the phrase is &quot; race horse . &quot;
uh , not in poland .
see , i got a whole bunch of these things
&apos;cause , uh , my aim isn &apos;t very good .
yeah , i have what the doctors call
&quot; a forked stream . &quot;
well , whichever of those you don &apos;t use , i &apos;ll take .
it &apos;ll be nice not to throw myself down a flight of stairs
every time i have a hunch .
oh , all right , well .
wish me luck , girls .
oh , wait up , sophie !
i &apos;ll hold the stick under you while you urinate .
oleg , you &apos;re gonna make a great father .
is it even possible for sophie to have a baby ?
i mean , didn &apos;t that window close around the same time
blockbuster video did ?
well , we don &apos;t know how old she is .
sophie &apos;s ageless , like a unicorn
or ... anderson cooper .
caroline , i found a city website
where we can complain about that tour guide .
why , what &apos;d he do to you ?
confuse you with a historic williamsburg fire hydrant ?
up top !
um , things have changed .
i &apos;m kind of all about the han and me connection right now .
sorry , max , you &apos;re out .
han , complaining online doesn &apos;t work .
true , if it did , they would have replaced
my faulty legos by now .
i say we gotta find him and knock some sense into him .
i &apos;m in .
that &apos;s the first time han has ever said that to a woman .
all right , can i just come ?
that tour guide keeps going on and on
into his mic in front of that bunch of euro trash .
it &apos;s like madonna on tour .
forget this ye olde williamsburg place .
those people should be having desserts at my diner !
yeah , if they wanted ye olde desserts ,
they should have come to us .
we &apos;ve got lady fingers so old , they have arthritis .
ooh , okay , here he comes . get ready !
oh , who am i kidding ? i can &apos;t do this !
i &apos;m not a violent person , and full disclosure ,
this is a nerf bat .
sorry , caroline , i hope this doesn &apos;t affect
our budding friendship / you never know ,
possible romance .
never gonna happen .
okay , han &apos;s dead to me . it &apos;s back to me and you .
thank god . those couple of hours were hell .
for me too .
hi , we need to talk to you .
i &apos;m caroline from max &apos;s homemade cupcakes .
oh , yeah , right .
i didn &apos;t recognize you without ...
the worst german accent i ever heard .
and you are ?
dannon .
like the yogurt ?
it &apos;s a family name .
listen , yoplait .
i personally don &apos;t give a crap what you think ,
but you bad @-@ mouthing our business
is upsetting my girl here .
you got that , activia ?
look , girls , i &apos;m not just talking about your business .
all the businesses on that block are gonna close .
it &apos;s getting plowed for an imax theatre .
oh , my god .
i know .
another max is getting plowed on our block ?
morning .
i can &apos;t believe they &apos;re replacing us with an imax .
that subway psychic told me
my business would skyrocket .
i guess this also means
i won &apos;t be a contestant on &quot; the voice . &quot;
that psychic had food all down her blouse .
she couldn &apos;t predict her mouth opening ,
let alone your life .
i &apos;m e @-@ mailing all the neighborhood business owners
to attend an emergency meeting tonight at the diner .
i &apos;ve contacted pretty much everyone
except that medical marijuana store .
you know , joint custody .
i &apos;ll call them . they &apos;re on my speed dial .
♪ pop my tarts pop my tarts ♪
♪ pop @-@ tarts , pop @-@ tarts , pop @-@ tarts ♪
♪ a boppa @-@ boppa boppa @-@ tarts- ♪
yes , it was me . i stress ate them .

personal pop @-@ tarts .

of course , i &apos;ve been dreaming about them my whole life .
i can &apos;t believe you ate the last of my s &apos;mores pop @-@ tarts .
fine , i &apos;ll go out and buy you another box
with the money i was saving for a wet n wild lip liner .
well , we know that &apos;s not opportunity knocking .
he lost my address when i moved in here .
hi , girls .
i &apos;m out of sugar ,
and can one of you read my morning pee stick ?
i can &apos;t read this little window thing
and i lost my cheaters and oleg &apos;s not upstairs .
so you lot both your cheaters .
yeah , see max ?
that kind of joke is no longer funny
now that we &apos;re gonna be parents .
so no more that !
it &apos;s just not my morning .
caroline , why don &apos;t you read it ?
might be nice to hear some good news
come out of your sad mouth for a change .
oh , just take it .
i &apos;m pretty sure i got the worst of it .
okay , now everybody hold hands and get ready to cry
&apos;cause i feel really , really , really pregnant .
it &apos;s negative .
you &apos;re negative !
sophie , i understand you &apos;re disappointed ,
but maybe you should manage your expectations .
oh , man i really thought i was pregnant .
i mean , my period &apos;s real late .
how late is late ?
hashtag , just asking for a friend .
well , i don &apos;t know .
six months ?
a year , tops .
well , i mean , at your age ...
oh , careful now .
don &apos;t be too dead to get my new pop @-@ tarts .

bedford methadone and drug clinic ?
常用作治疗毒瘾替代药

we &apos;ll just wait for one more business to arrive before we start .
oh , and thank you all for coming .
oh , and thank you
for closing the diner tonight for this meeting .
oh , we &apos;re not closed .
nope , this is a busy thursday for us .
oh , hi , are you here for the meeting ?
yeah , we &apos;re smiley time daycare .
well , if sophie has a baby ,
i think we found our nanny .
okay , tonight &apos;s call to arms
is really about each and every one of us
and our dreams .
small businesses are and have always been
the backbone of williamsburg .
but this is about so much more than business .
let me help .
i took a class in motivational speaking .
well motivate your ass back down .
i got this .
do you ? you &apos;re losing this crowd
faster than i &apos;m going to lose my diner .
he &apos;s right , move it along .
you make that boring crock guy
look like a sweeps episode of &quot; empire . &quot;
that was just my opening .
and your closing . thanks , caroline .
yes , i said yes , folks .
yes , we are all businesses ,
but we are one hell of a lot more than that !
impressive . it &apos;s like tony robbins
and a pine nut had a baby .
we are a family ,
and the only way @-@ the only way out of this crap
is each other .
can i get a &quot; what @-@ what ? &quot;
what @-@ what !
can i get a high @-@ five ?
high @-@ five !
all right ! high @-@ five !
i &apos;m so jealous .
i &apos;ve been dying to do that for years .
and tomorrow , we need you ,
and i mean every one of you ,
to join my diner family at that public hearing
down at the brooklyn courthouse
and we are going to tell them
they can keep their stinking buyout money .
yeah !
there isn &apos;t enough money in the world
to buyout our leases .
yeah .
han , i don &apos;t-
wait , they want to buy us out ?
not 20,000 , not 30,000--
dollars ? i could live in india .
i wouldn &apos;t have to sell these dumb crystals anymore .
but we are a family !
yeah , we &apos;re a family .
might just be us tomorrow .
with the addition of the imax ,
i predict that the net worth
of this now dilapidated group of businesses
will at least quadruple .
and commissioner , you don &apos;t know me ,
but when it comes to finance ,
when it comes to most things really ,
i &apos;m very hands on .
and also a douche .
we &apos;ll take a break and then hear arguments from the opposing side .
max , i &apos;m gonna ask you a serious question
and i want the truth .
is it , &quot; can you smell that onion bagel on my breath , &quot;
&apos;cause yes .
do you think our business dream
is as far @-@ fetched as sophie &apos;s baby dream ?
you know sophie &apos;s right there , right ?
don &apos;t get her mad .
i once saw her open up a can of paint with her knees .
i mean , aren &apos;t all dreams kind of crazy ?
isn &apos;t that why they &apos;re called dreams ,
&apos;cause they &apos;re not real ?
at some point , you have to wake up and pee , right ?
sometimes five times a night .
well , at least you won &apos;t have to listen to that annoying
tour guide &apos;s speech twice a day anymore .
right , if you look to your left ,
you &apos;ll see a failing cupcake shop
with two completely deluded shop owners .
in fact , the only redeeming feature
in this waste of architecture are the historic tiffany windows
right next to those two bitches .
wait , what about the windows ?
he says that ? i totally missed that ?
yeah , because you &apos;re too busy sprechen the cupcakes .
oh , my god , those tiffany windows
might be old enough to qualify us
as a historic landmark building .
oh , oh , my god , i &apos;ll be right back .
where are you going ?
down to the city archives .
i need proof that those windows are legit .
if i &apos;m not back when it &apos;s our turn to speak ,
stall them . fill time .
just go on an on talking about nothing .
got it . pretend i &apos;m you .
but you would need a miracle to find that proof in time .
psst , max , you got a tampon ?
i just got my period .
either that , or i &apos;ve been shot .
sophie can still have a baby !
see , miracles can happen !
the woman is right there .
and like i &apos;ve already said twice , your honor ,
i &apos;ve worked at that diner since 1989,
so , peace out .
she &apos;s still not back . keep going .
your honor , i &apos;ve been working at that diner
since 1989 .
i think we &apos;ve heard everything this gentlemen
has to say about the building in question ,
including , for some reason ,
of his brief affair with comedian nipsy russell &apos;s wife .
she was from brooklyn !
i thought it was pertinent , your honor .
if there are no other witnesses--
han , go , go , go , go .
no , i already blew this once .
finally , you admit you blew something
when i can &apos;t enjoy it .
oleg , you go .
i can &apos;t . the judge knows me
from a sort of &quot; eyes wide shut &quot; situation .
you go .
no , nothing good ever happened to me in a courtroom .
every single time , they just gave me back to my mother .
i &apos;ll go .
yeah , i &apos;ve got something to say .
you &apos;re a lady judge .
you got any midol ?
well , if there are no further witnesses ...
damn it , yo !
i guess i have something to say .
wonderful .
carmella , we just lost our lunch table .
nice model you got there ,
except imaxs are supposed to be big .
that &apos;s kind of the point .
miss , if you don &apos;t have anything pertinent--
stop , you can &apos;t tear our building down !
so excited , i feel like i &apos;m in &quot; legally blonde . &quot;
those tiffany windows are over 100 years old ,
making it a historic , landmark building .
do you have documented proof of this ?
yes , i do , your honor .
so dramatic . i &apos;m loving it .
living , breathing , boring proof .
your honor , this gentlemen is an expert
on historic williamsburg .
dannon , tell them about the windows .
first say it .
say it in the eyes of the court , or no deal .
i will never do a german accent again .
the building &apos;s windows were created by tiffany studios
in a playful fish motif for the original williamsburg fish market ,
opened at that location in june , 1901 .
well , that qualifies as a landmark .
yes !
yah , dis is vuunderbar !
well , i never promised you anything .
how do you like that , max ?
these cute little fishies from the fish market
saved our business and the diner .
it &apos;s weird i &apos;d wind up working in a former fish market .
dannon told me the market was also a front for a whore house .
yeah , that &apos;s more like it .
now i have a serious question for you
and i want you to tell me the truth .
would it have been smarter for us
to take whatever of that buyout money
we would have forced han to give us and quit ?
probably .
but max , i &apos;ve wanted my own business since i was little .
it &apos;s purely emotional .
i can &apos;t really explain it .
i can . it &apos;s your ppt .
your personal pop @-@ tart .
it is . it &apos;s my ppt .
then i totally get it .
yeah , you do , max . you always do .
well , girls , it &apos;s official .
you &apos;re still short ?
we won !
the entire neighborhood has just been notified
there is no imax buyout .
yep , and they do not look happy .
here they come .
hey , you !
yeah , you !
open up ! they have sticks !
can &apos;t leave him out there , can we ?
aah ! oh , god !
