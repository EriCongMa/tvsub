1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 !
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 !
come on . come on , baby , breathe !
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 !
come on , breathe ! come on , i &apos;m not losing you .
ambulance is on its way . come on , stay with me .
there &apos;s no pulse .
hey , you ok , buddy ? you all right ?
good . ok .
get back in there . go on . good job .
good morning .
how was your weekend ?
good . jack had 2 soccer games yesterday .
they win ?
oh , we don &apos;t keep score in jack &apos;s age group .
that bad , huh ?
yeah .
and now they &apos;ve asked me to coach .
you &apos;re kidding .
why &apos;d they ask you ?
focus .
don &apos;t doubt that .
you can &apos;t get half the parents to look up from their phones
during the game . at least i participate .
it &apos;s not like you &apos;re too busy .
let &apos;s get started .
yes .
unidentified young woman
plunged off a roadside cliff
in lake worth , north carolina .
that is 200 miles outside of raleigh .
most of the people who live there are retired
or have moved there for a slower pace
and now work in the tourism industry .
this woman survived ?
yes . local sheriff found her .
no one her age was missing from the town ?
nope .
so why do they need us ?
here &apos;s the thing--
3 years ago , some coyotes found the torso
of a jane doe in the woods nearby .
she sustained similar injuries .
both women had stab wounds
all over their bodies from various weapons .
new girl &apos;s fingerprints didn &apos;t lead anywhere .
her wounds haven &apos;t scarred .
he probably didn &apos;t have her for very long .
she &apos;s got dirt on her clothes and under her nails .
she &apos;d been raped repeatedly and tortured .
sadists usually restrain their victims
on their own turf , don &apos;t they ?
that &apos;s right . it means he &apos;s from lake worth
and didn &apos;t mean for her to get away .
she probably saw an opportunity to flee and she took it .
if the unsub has a torture chamber in the area ,
he &apos;s not gonna leave it empty for long . let &apos;s go .
agathon said ,
&quot; of this alone even god is deprived--
&quot; the power of making things that are past
never to have been . &quot;
doctor &apos;s report says our critical victim &apos;s
in her late teens .
just like the first jane doe .
no one from town is missing , which mean he most likely
picks his victims up outside lake worth .
the 2008 jane doe was found in the woods over here ,
and the most recent victim
was found on the south side of the lake
heading out of town .
so the unsub most likely
holds them somewhere in between .
how long do we think he held his new victim ?
the bruises are still green ,
which means they &apos;re no more than 8 days old .
her body &apos;s dehydrated ,
suggesting he wants to keep them weak .
but he underestimated her . when she had the chance she ran .
is it possible the 2008 jane doe was his first victim ?
80 % of sexual sadists have a dozen or more victims
in their past . they lead normal lives
and eventually develop god complexes .
they usually have a ruse that helps them
abduct the victims as well .
garcia &apos;s looking for missing persons
in the neighboring states .
good . dave , you , reid and i will go to the hospital ,
see if we can talk to the victim .
seaver and i will hit the crime scene .
good .
what are her injuries ?
the fall caused a c @-@ 4 spinal fracture ,
paralyzing her from the neck down .
she had an enormous amount of internal bleeding
and an elevated heavy metal count in her blood .
what , uh , what is he doing ?
he &apos;s profiling her .
we have an unconscious jane doe ,
yet we can still learn a lot about who she is
by studying her body .
this wasn &apos;t a high @-@ risk victim
like a drug addict or a prostitute .
orthodontic works shows she was cared for ,
most likely from a middle @-@ class family .
tan lines are fading , which means she &apos;s probably
from a warm climate or spent a lot of time outdoors ,
probably playing sports . shin splits on the right leg
further supports the theory that she &apos;s an athlete ,
which means if she escaped from her captor ,
she could have run for miles .
what about the patterns in her wounds ?
i &apos;m not sure what he used to cut her with ,
but it definitely wasn &apos;t a knife .
dr. boyd , she &apos;s opened her eyes .
i &apos;ve been on the job for about 2 weeks .
did you think it was a sadist back then ?
most definitely .
we opened an investigation in &apos; 08,
but it quickly became a cold case .
well , the new girl must have surprised you .
oh , when we found her body on the road ,
i thought the two cases were related ,
so i called you guys .
you must have seen this kind of thing in philly .
that &apos;s exactly why i left .
i thought here i &apos;d be ticketing tourists
or citing locals for growing pot .
but never this .
what do you think she was running from ?
well , there &apos;s nothing but acres and acres of forest up there .
the dogs picked up her scent going this way .
that &apos;s towards town ?
yeah , but her scent soon tapered off .
all right , why don &apos;t we go this way .
why ?
if the unsub knew ane doe escaped ,
he may have taken forensic countermeasures
to make us think that she headed in the opposite direction .
i &apos;m dr. spencer reid from the fbi .
can you tell me your name ?
can you tell me who did this to you ?
he hurt ...
who hurt ?
he has ...
mercy .
mercy .
who is &quot; he &quot; ?
doctor , her stats are dropping .
it &apos;s intracranial bleed . call the o.r.
reid .
bp 62 over 43 .
defib .
no pulse .
clear !
move her gown .
&quot; he has mercy &quot; ?
that &apos;s what it sounded like ,
our unsub must be a master manipulator
to have her thinking that .
he probably didn &apos;t have her for more than a week ,
but she learned to adapt .
do you smell that ?
yeah .
ammonia .
guys .
oh , god .
it reminds me of elizabeth smart and jaycee dugard .
their captors forced them to play out their fantasies
and they obliged to stay alive .
yeah , morgan .
yeah , hotch . you gotta get down here .
there &apos;s something you gotta see .
what did you find ?
first we started smelling ammonia and then we came across this .
how many bodies ?
that shallow grave was empty .
you think our victim was in it ?
it looked fresh .
so he probably took her down to be buried .
and that &apos;s when she escaped .
forensics thinks some of these graves may be up to 10 years old .
got another one !
what the hell ? jeez .
garcia needs to check missing persons cases
going back at least 10 years .
garcia said 8 teenage girls have gone missing
from the carolinas in the past decade .
the hospitalized jane doe was blond .
3 of the 8 are blondes .
what about the recent missing person reports ?
nothing came up .
i &apos;m going to put you on speaker , garcia .
so , your girl wonder just got a call from raleigh p.d.
who heard we were looking for a missing person .
it turns out that shreveport police found an abandoned car today
that is registered to a mr. and mrs. linda and don owens
of raleigh , north carolina .
what &apos;s that got to do with this ?
ok , this is why this is important .
it turns out mr. and mrs. owens let their daughter ,
who goes to north carolina college ,
borrow their car so that her and her best friend
could drive to tampa for spring break .
but they never made it there .
what are the girls &apos; names ?
angela proctor and marcy owens .
both are 19 years old .
are they blond ?
marcy is , angela &apos;s a brunette .
do you have photographs ?
yeah . that &apos;s why i &apos;ve already sent them to your phones .
if the girl in the hospital is angela ,
she probably wasn &apos;t saying &quot; he has mercy , &quot;
she was saying , &quot; he has marcy . &quot;
dad , can i come out ?
honey , daddy &apos;s really busy right now .
i have to use the bathroom .
i &apos;m making you a gift . hurry up .
where &apos;s angela ?
you &apos;re all alone now .
so this guy dyed angela &apos;s hair ?
it &apos;s not unusual for an unsub
to manipulate his victim to fit his fantasy .
and you don &apos;t think he &apos;s killed marcy ?
hopefully she fits his delusion
and he &apos;s continuing to play it out with her .
it &apos;s imperative we alert the community .
well , you do what you gotta do .
when this gets out , it &apos;s gonna kill tourism .
my only concern right now is for the girl .
the lab confirmed that the 3 graves
contained blond women in their late teens .
so the unsub does have a type .
he was probably hurt by one or in love with one .
sexual sadists have rage , and based on angela &apos;s wounds ,
my money &apos;s on hurt .
you know , raleigh &apos;s 4 hours away .
that &apos;s quite a distance to go to abduct the girls .
well , he must feel comfortable in that area .
where &apos;s our list of locals with sexual records ?
here .
speak and be heard , my superfriends .
garcia , check to see if any of our suspects with sexual offenses
had any priors outside of lake worth .
sam edmann . he was booked
in &apos; 65 for ... fondling his girlfriend &apos;s 6 @-@ year @-@ old son .
more recent .
mark hillman was busted in 2009
for flashing a girl .
flashing doesn &apos;t really say sexual sadist .
right , right . ok , what about--eew--
marcus talbot .
he was nabbed for peeping into holes in the walls
in the girls bathroom at the art institute 15 years ago .
what does he do now ?
he is ...
oh , jeez , really ?
people do not do their homework .
he is currently the art teacher
at the high school at lake worth where you guys are right now .
he spends a lot of time with teenage girls .
seaver , stay here and wait for the parents .
reid and morgan , go to talbot &apos;s house .
dave and i will go to the school .
the goal is not to change your subjects ,
but for the subjects to change the photographer .
what do you think this picture is saying ?
yeah , morgan .
hotch , it &apos;s him .
i just found a small ncc sweatshirt with blood on it
hidden in the shed .
there &apos;s no sign of the girl , though .
if the eyes are the windows into the soul ,
what is she thinking ?
was she asked a question
just as the picture was taken ?
is she happy ?
sad ?
scared ?
mr. talbot , may i see you for a second ?
think about your answers .
i &apos;ll be right back .
marcus talbot ?
yes .
you &apos;re under arrest
for the kidnappings of angela proctor ,
and marcy owens .
what ? !
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will
you &apos;re making a mistake !
be used against you in a court of law .
you &apos;re making a mistake !
it &apos;s only been an hour and there are people outside already .
the beauty of a small town .
i assume talbot &apos;s not married ?
guys like talbot are loners .
they like to operate without a spouse
looking over their shoulder .
don &apos;t we all .
how &apos;s it going , reid ?
i don &apos;t think he had marcy or angela here .
maybe he has a secondary location .
you know , trophy or not , it &apos;s pretty careless
to keep angela &apos;s clothes .
he &apos;s plagued by a fear of chaos
and obsesses over any disorder .
well , welcome to 1992 .
yeah , music &apos;s his only entertainment .
he doesn &apos;t have a tv or a computer .
just your type , isn &apos;t she ?
you can &apos;t just hold me here .
i did not kidnap those girls .
i love kids .
i mean , i &apos;m a teacher .
and , uh , speaking of which ,
i have another class starting in an hour .
yeah , well , class is canceled .
then i want my phone call .
the phones are down .
what are you gonna do to me ?
what am i gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna wait !
until you tell me where that other girl is .
sheriff .
excuse me , may i have a word with you , please ?
if talbot has her , it &apos;s critical the way we talk to him .
i &apos;ve broken tougher scumbags than this perv .
i &apos;m sure you have .
but we found a burial site ,
so this is no longer just about marcy and angela .
so you don &apos;t want me in there ?
no , not now .
unbelievable .
i don &apos;t get it .
you got angela &apos;s parents in there ?
they &apos;re devastated .
ok , stay with them . i &apos;m gonna go talk to marcy &apos;s parents .
ok .
thanks .
i don &apos;t know this girl or the other one .
how many times do i have to tell you that ?
this is angela proctor . she &apos;s dead .
and the other one is marcy owens .
now , it makes sense that you wouldn &apos;t know their names .
i swear to you , i didn &apos;t kidnap them .
you know , the other thing i &apos;ve learned about you guys ,
it &apos;s never just one secret .
wow , this guy &apos;s old school . he shoots on film .
he &apos;s too controlling to let anyone else develop it .
looks like angela proctor wasn &apos;t his only secret .
what have you got ?
it looks like this guy talbot had another hobby .
the girls in these photos can &apos;t be more than 16 years old .
photos .
morgan , how many are there ?
i &apos;m thinking 30 , 40 .
54 .
excuse me . that &apos;s 54 .
they &apos;re my students .
first you put a hole in the girls bathroom wall ,
and now this ?
i don &apos;t even take the pictures . they do .
you think that matters ?
you know , at first the pictures are enough .
but then those urges come back .
you have to touch one .
and that &apos;s why you took marcy and angela .
it isn &apos;t like that .
i don &apos;t hurt those girls .
i teach them .
i would never hurt them .
i love them .
you love taking pictures of them .
it &apos;s a hobby .
it &apos;s a ruse !
you prey on the vulnerability of young women .
you take them alone into your house , alone in the dark .
you have them all to yourself .
that &apos;s not true .
now , you tell me where marcy is right now ,
and as much as i hate it , i &apos;ll make things easier for you .
i told you , i don &apos;t know her .
i have to pee so bad !
hurry up , angela .
hurry up !
you girls having car trouble ?
ah , it &apos;s just nature calling .
we &apos;re fine , thanks .
marcy owens ?
help me !
somebody help me !
we &apos;ve been coming here every summer
for the last 10 years .
is this where this freak first saw marcy ?
when was the last time you spoke to marcy ?
she texted me a few times during the trip .
but you didn &apos;t actually speak to her ?
uh , it &apos;s her first year in college .
it &apos;s not unusual that we go for a couple of days without talking .
i understand .
earlier in the trip ,
she uses text abbreviations ,
but later on she spells out
some of the same words she abbreviated .
you think he was texting us ,
pretending he was the girls in tampa ?
probably .
my god .
so this guy sees marcy here on a family vacation ,
then follows her to school ?
who does that ?
he &apos;s a resident of lake worth with a history in raleigh ,
but chances are he met the girls here .
marcy .
he met marcy .
angela &apos;s never been here .
we saw what he did to her body .
do you think he did that to her every day ?
we &apos;re not sure , ma &apos;am .
i am so sorry .
when you vacationed in lake worth in the past ,
did marcy every ever go to summer camp ?
uh , a few times ,
at the community center .
do you know if she ever took a photography class
with a man named marcus talbot ?
yeah .
she loved it .
do you know if they were ever alone together ?
why are you asking ?
is he a suspect ?
he &apos;s someone we &apos;re talking to .
do you know if she was alone with him ?
we don &apos;t know . she was gone all day .
he held the class at his house .
his darkroom was there .
it was ?
marcy was in your summer camp in 2006 .
ok . she was 14 . she took it again for the next 4 summers .
students like me .
come on , talbot , you groomed her !
you just couldn &apos;t wait anymore !
if you &apos;re telling me she was in my house , i believe you ,
but i didn &apos;t touch her . i didn &apos;t do it .
what ? !
hey , rossi , i think the dog just found something else here .
well , this just doesn &apos;t look very good for you , talbot .
i want my damn lawyer .
this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
the grave &apos;s fresh .
he either dug it quickly because he knew we were coming--
or somebody else did .
we just found that burial site
that was off the property .
the guy uses countermeasures .
here &apos;s there &apos;s just evidence lying all around .
reid , he wouldn &apos;t operate like this .
someone &apos;s framing talbot .
yeah , but who ?
how are you ?
oh , god .
it was so busy at the restaurant today .
are you happy to see me , rose ?
i could nail talbot right now on physical evidence alone .
but it doesn &apos;t fit the unsub &apos;s actual behavior .
this guy uses forensic countermeasures .
he doesn &apos;t leave evidence all over the place .
our unsub &apos;s attempting to frame talbot .
when angela got away , he probably panicked .
and he thought he could pin it on him .
he must have known marcy had a connection
to talbot &apos;s photography class .
and that talbot has a proclivity towards girls that age .
we &apos;re on the right track . we &apos;re looking for somebody
with a similar story to talbot .
he &apos;s a resident of lake worth even if he &apos;s not a native .
and it &apos;s likely he has ties to other parts of the state .
he &apos;s running away from something .
our unsub must have own talbot had a secret
because he has one , too .
yeah , but how do we find it ?
talbot &apos;s got a lawyer on the way .
if i don &apos;t book him now , he walks .
then the longer we can keep talbot in custody ,
the better chance we have of finding marcy .
and if he &apos;s released ?
the unsub will do whatever he needs to do to survive .
and we lose marcy .
seaver , go to the owens &apos; cottage ,
see if you can take a look at marcy
through the unsub &apos;s eyes .
ok .
angela &apos;s autopsy is almost finished .
reid , look at the report when it comes in .
dave , you and morgan stay on talbot .
he knows who this guy is even if he &apos;s not aware of it .
please !
i &apos;m not done yet , rosie .
please , no .
i don &apos;t get this .
first you were grilling me about kidnapping and murder ,
and now you want me to help you .
someone had access to your house that saw what i saw .
i don &apos;t have to help you .
you humiliated me for nothing .
i thought you cared about the girls .
i do .
then start talking .
we want the names of everyone who &apos;s stepped foot in your house
in the last 5 months .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
what is it , rosie ?
why are you doing this , dad ?
i have a mom and a dad
who are probably worried about me .
it &apos;s ok , rosie .
things are gonna get better .
i &apos;m not rose .
i &apos;m marcy owens from raleigh , north carolina .
rosie .
i told you not to lie .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
ok .
ok . it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s ok .
marcy wore a lot of ncc stuff .
she practically lived in it .
she advertised where she was going to school .
is that how he knew where to find her ?
we don &apos;t know that yet .
add barbara shuller
and ben holtzman .
they all developed their film at your place ?
i &apos;m the only gig in town .
everyone &apos;s gone digital .
who else has access to your darkroom ?
repairmen ? a friend ?
we bought this place when marcy was 10 .
one for every year ?
there &apos;s an art festival every summer .
that &apos;s where she gets most of this stuff .
i &apos;m sorry , i just don &apos;t know how this is going to help .
knowing your routines can be very useful .
what else did you do ?
sometimes we go to church .
marcy loves to sing .
was she in the choir ?
she &apos;s amazing . everyone was in awe
when she got up and did her solo .
ok , so i cross @-@ checked morgan &apos;s list
of people who may have seen talbot &apos;s darkroom
with church membership . i &apos;ve got 5 matches .
you run backgrounds ? sure did .
none of them have records .
i found something that might be helpful .
autopsy report revealed fragments of glass
in some of angela &apos;s wounds .
were they able to identify the blades used ?
only that there were a number of them .
the doctor mentioned she had heavy metals in her blood .
yeah . the highest one being lead .
well , add that to the unique patterns
of her wounds and the glass in her cuts ,
maybe this guy worked with stained glass .
talbot had stained glass in his front door .
the owens had stained glass window chimes in their condo .
lead fumes can get into your system
during the soldering process .
what ? my second wife was crafty .
garcia , anybody on the list
work with stained glass ?
yeah . robert bremmer .
bremmer . talbot said he met him only once .
well , mr. bremmer &apos;s been a member
of the church for 16 years .
he travels all over the state doing craft fairs .
he also owns the rose cafe .
bingo , strange man voice .
it looks like he &apos;s from wilkesboro .
he moved there to lake worth in &apos; 91
after his wife and stepdaughter
were killed in a car accident .
was he a suspe ?
there &apos;s no record of that , but ...
wait till you see the picture .
they look a lot alike .
where &apos;s the restaurant ?
real close .
excuse me , is robert bremmer here ?
yeah . robert ?
robert ?
that &apos;s weird . he was just here .
he &apos;s gone .
rosie !
it &apos;s time .
time for what ?
it &apos;s time to leave .
i have a plan . listen .
i have a plan .
and we will be together forever . ok ?
all right .
where are we going ?
let &apos;s move .
what do you mean by forever ?
let &apos;s go ! move it !
move . move , move !
good girl . yeah .
that a girl .
so here &apos;s the deal .
robert bremmer married a woman
who had a daughter from a previous relationship
who was 10 years old named rose .
now , this woman was super mentally unstable .
she goes into the hospital for depression .
when she does , the only
person watching rose is her stepdad robert
and he is accused of abusing her .
that &apos;s why women with daughters seldom remarry .
they fear men will prey on their young .
so the wife is released from the hospital ,
the first thing she does
is try to leave robert with her daughter ,
but every time she tries that , he tracks them down .
the mom is so out of her head
that in some sort of act of desperation
she takes her life and the life of her daughter rose .
according to police records ,
she drove her car right into a lake
somewhere around wilkesboro .
hey , hotch .
yeah ?
these chimes are just like the ones i saw
at the owens condo .
sheriff .
all clear down here .
he &apos;s not inside .
he &apos;s executing his end game .
how do you know ?
it &apos;s taken him 20 years to find a replacement .
this time he &apos;s gonna die with her .
in the lake . let &apos;s go .
garcia , i need the make and model of bremmer &apos;s car .
sending it now .
what are we doing ?
where are you taking me ?
we can all be together now , rose .
i know mommy &apos;s missed you ,
and she would love to see you .
morgan , you head towards the south end of the bridge .
we &apos;re coming in from the west .
no , no , no , no .
don &apos;t you say a word .
it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s ok . shh .
it &apos;s ok .
we &apos;re almost there , rose .
what &apos;s up , ted ?
sorry , henry . we gotta check everyone .
that &apos;s his car .
call hotch .
hotch , we have a visual on bremmer
at the lake worth roadblock .
robert bremmer , get out of the car !
i won &apos;t let them take you from me , rose .
i won &apos;t let them take you .
no , dad , don &apos;t !
stop !
help me !
hotch , he &apos;s on the move . head him off . head him off !
no !
she &apos;s got no pulse .
come on , i &apos;m not losing you . come on !
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ...
1 , 2 , 3 ...
1 , 2 ...
2 , 3 , 4 ...
come on , stay with me .
1 , 2 , 3 ...
1 , 2 , 3 ...
come on .
come on !
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 .
you &apos;re gonna be ok .
appreciate it , thank you .
best of luck to you , sheriff .
thank you .
time to go .
