i really appreciate it . thank you .
whatcha reading ?
&quot; the hulk ... vs . wolverine . &quot;
i &apos;m ava . i think i &apos;ve seen you around school .
you &apos;re in ms. blanchard &apos;s class , right ?
almost ready , ava ?
mm , this is my brother nicholas .
come on . let &apos;s go .
you wanna come out ?
sure .
where the hell do you think you &apos;re going ?
open up your bag .
what ?
don &apos;t think i didn &apos;t see you rob me . open your bag .
but i didn &apos;t take anything .
and a liar , too .
that &apos;s why you were talking to me .
so your brother could put that stuff in there .
henry , i &apos;m shocked .
and you two-- just who do you think you are ?
a fine specimen .
the wood it provides
will keep our family &apos;s hearth warm this winter .
can &apos;t i have an ax ?
you did say you wanted me here so i could help .
that i did .
so here &apos;s your task--
take the cart .
go fill it with kindling . the drier the better .
okay .
and have your brother accompany you .
okay .
come on .
wait .
take this .
your compass ?
so you don &apos;t get lost .
a family always needs to be able to find one another .
okay . go .
be safe .
it &apos;s getting late . we should go .
give it back . come on , gretel .
give it back .
no , hansel . we need to get back to father .
fine .
follow me .
this is where we left him .
so why isn &apos;t he here ?
father ?
father !
father !
father ?
father !
get up .
what are you doing in my forest ?
i &apos;m sorry , madam mayor ,
but your son was shoplifting .
were you ?
look for yourself .
my son doesn &apos;t eat candy ,
and he knows better than to steal .
it was obviously those two .
we &apos;re going .
henry . what happened ?
ms. swan , must i remind you that genetics mean nothing ?
you &apos;re not his mother , and it &apos;s all taken care of .
i &apos;m here because i &apos;m the sheriff .
oh , that &apos;s right .
go on . do your job .
take care of those miscreants .
did you call their parents ?
uh , the number they gave me was ... disconnected .
did you guys give mr. clark a fake number ?
then why is it disconnected ?
&apos;cause our parents couldn &apos;t pay the bill .
you guys were just trying to help out , huh ?
please . please don &apos;t arrest us .
it &apos;ll just make things worse for our parents .
please forgive us .
we didn &apos;t mean to bother you . we just ...
well , we just lost our father .
two helpless children ,
lost and alone ,
the family torn asunder .
such a sad and moving story .
guards .
seize them .
hansel , run !
running from me is foolish .
foolish .
but also brave .
and that bravery ...
may just have saved you and your family &apos;s lives .
you &apos;re--you &apos;re letting us go ?
oh , i &apos;m doing so much more than that .
i &apos;m going to find your father .
you are ?
why ?
because you two are going to do something for me .
and then ...
you &apos;ll take us home ?
this it ?
please . no .
if our parents see you , they &apos;ll be so embarrassed .
did henry tell you about my superpower ?
we just met him .
i have the ability to tell when anyone is lying .
so tell me the truth .
money problems aside , is everything okay at home ?
yeah , we &apos;re great .
can we go ?
all right .
she &apos;s gone .
we &apos;re good .
why &apos;d you guys lie to me ?
where are your parents ?
we don &apos;t have any .
do you know them ? do they go to your school ?
i &apos;ve seen them , but ...
i had no idea . none of us did .
ava and nicolas zimmer
said their mother was a woman named dorrie zimmer .
she died a few years ago .
no one seems to know her or remember her .
and the father ?
there isn &apos;t one--at least not one that they know .
what does , uh , what does social services say ?
you didn &apos;t report them .
i report them , i can &apos;t help them .
they go into the system .
the system that &apos;s supposed to help .
yeah , says the woman who wasn &apos;t in it for 16 years .
do you know what happens ?
they get thrown into homes where they are a meal ticket .
nothing more .
these families get paid for these kids ,
and as soon as they &apos;re too much work ,
they get tossed out and it all starts over again .
but they &apos;re not all like that .
all the ones i was in .
what , we &apos;re just gonna adopt them ?
i want to look for their father .
they don &apos;t know him .
he may not know they exist .
and you think if he knows he &apos;ll want them ?
i don &apos;t know .
but what i do know
is it &apos;s hard enough finding foster families
to take one kid that isn &apos;t theirs , let alone two .
it &apos;s their best shot or--
we &apos;re gonna be separated ?
no .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
please .
please don &apos;t let it .
excuse me .
mr ... kry @-@ zowksi ?
it &apos;s kryzyszkowski .
everyone calls me &quot; k. &quot;
mr. k. , i am sheriff swan .
i &apos;m hoping to look at the birth certificates
of nicholas and ava zimmer .
well , just , uh , fill out this form ...
in triplicate .
okay .
i &apos;m so sorry .
those documents have been recently removed .
by who ?
don &apos;t worry , ms. swan . you can relax .
i &apos;ve contacted social services .
turns out these kids are on their own .
they need help .
which is exactly what i &apos;m trying to do .
i &apos;m trying to find their father .
he doesn &apos;t exist .
he has to .
住址 未知 国籍 未知
well , of course , biologically , he exists ,
but there &apos;s no record of him ,
which means we have no choice .
these children need a home
so they will be put into the foster system .
storybrooke has a foster system ?
no , but i &apos;ve contacted the state .
maine &apos;s group homes , unfortunately , are filled ,
but they &apos;ve put us in touch with two homes in boston--
a boy &apos;s home and a girl &apos;s .
they &apos;re separating them ?
i don &apos;t like it either ,
but we &apos;ve got no choice .
you need to have them in boston tonight .
me ?
well , you wanted to be sheriff .
this is what sheriffs do .
yes , you &apos;re taking them .
no . i promised them they wouldn &apos;t be separated .
well , then perhaps you should stop
making promises you can &apos;t keep .
these children need a home .
i &apos;m just trying to find the best one .
what is that ?
my father &apos;s compass .
he gave it to me so i could find him ,
but now it &apos;s broken .
when are you gonna tell us where we &apos;re going ?
this is close enough .
close enough to what ?
the home of the blind witch .
that doesn &apos;t sound good .
she has something of mine ,
and i need you to get it back .
what is it ?
something i need
to defeat a very wicked and powerful enemy .
it &apos;s kept in a black leather satchel
inside her house .
well , why don &apos;t you get it yourself ?
how come you need us ?
because the house is protected by magic .
i can &apos;t enter .
but luckily , the spell doesn &apos;t work on children .
you &apos;ll have to wait here until nightfall .
and then ...
once the witch is asleep ...
you can sneak in .
and if we do this ,
you promise you &apos;ll find our father ?
oh , indeed i will .
but there &apos;s one more thing--
the witch &apos;s house is ...
unique ,
and because of this ,
you have to take special precaution once you &apos;re inside .
like what ?
no matter what you do ,
no matter how you &apos;re tempted ...
don &apos;t ...
eat ...
anything .
any luck ?
no .
i know who they are .
a brother and sister ,
lost ,
no parents .
hansel and gretel .
anything in there about the dad ?
just that he abandoned them .
great .
sounds like a familiar story .
whoever this guy is , he could be in laos by now .
no , he &apos;s here .
just how do you know that ?
&apos;cause no one leaves storybrooke .
no one comes here .
no one goes .
it &apos;s just the way it is .
i came here .
because you &apos;re special .
you &apos;re the first stranger here ever .
right . i forgot .
well , if he &apos;s around here anywhere , i &apos;m gonna find him .
can you tell me about him ?
i don &apos;t know anything yet .
not their father .
mine .
i told you about your parents .
now you &apos;re even living with your mom .
mary margaret isn &apos;t--
she &apos;s ...
never mind .
please ?
i was pretty young .
i &apos;d just gotten out of the foster system ,
and the only job i could get was
at this 24 @-@ hour diner just off the interstate .
and , um ...
your dad was training to be a fireman .
he always got the worst shifts , so he &apos;d come in
and order coffee and pie and sit at the counter
and always complained that we didn &apos;t sell pumpkin pie ,
but he always came back the next night anyway .
did you get married ?
oh , no . nothing like that .
we just--we hung out a few times outside of work .
and ...
life happened .
his got better and mine got worse , and ...
i got in some trouble .
when you went to jail .
yeah .
and before i went , i ...
i found out i was pregnant with you .
and ... i tried to contact him .
and i found out ...
that he died
saving a family from a burning apartment building .
so you think i &apos;m a savior , henry ?
he was .
your father was a real hero .
do you have anything of his ?
something you can remember him by ?
something i could see ?
i ...
i don &apos;t .
henry ...
i &apos;m sorry . i gotta go .
i may know how to find this guy .
i want to show you guys something .
here .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s my baby blanket .
it &apos;s something i &apos;ve held on to my whole life .
it &apos;s the only thing that i have from ...
from my parents .
i spent a lot of time
with a lot of kids in your situation ,
and all of them ...
all of us ...
we held on to stuff .
i want to find your father ,
but i need your help .
is there anything of his you &apos;ve held on to ?
i might have something .
but if i give it to you ,
you &apos;ll make sure we stay together , right ?
right .
a compass ?
our mom kept it .
she said it was our dad &apos;s .
thank you .
did you find them ?
who ?
your parents .
not yet .
but i &apos;m gonna find yours .
shh .
how can you be sure she &apos;s sleeping ?
i can &apos;t . and remember what the queen said .
not even a lick .
you &apos;re right .
look .
and there &apos;s the satchel .
what do you think &apos;s inside it ?
does it matter ?
all that matters is getting it to the queen
so she can find father .
no !
i smell dinner .
emma .
how lovely to see you .
i &apos;m flattered you &apos;d take time out of your busy schedule for me .
what can i do for you , sheriff ?
i &apos;m looking for information on this old compass .
any idea where it could &apos;ve come from ?
well , well .
look at the detail .
you know , this is crystal ,
this jeweled setting ?
despite the rather unfortunate shape this it &apos;s in ,
this is actually a very unusual piece .
the person who owned this obviously had great taste .
and where would someone like that buy it ?
right here , of course .
you know it ?
indeed . a piece like this is difficult to forget .
do you happen to remember who bought it ?
well , i &apos;m good with names , ms. swan ,
but maybe not that good .
however , as luck would have it ,
i do keep quite extensive records ...
and ...
yes .
here we are .
what &apos;s your price ?
forgiveness .
how about tolerance ?
well , that &apos;s a start .
the compass was purchased by a mr. michael tillman .
anything else ?
just a name ,
but i generally find that &apos;s all one needs .
good luck with your investigation .
not possible .
actually , it is .
i &apos;m sorry . look , dorrie-- she wasn &apos;t my , um ...
it was just once .
sometimes that &apos;s all it takes .
i met her when i was camping ...
and we , um ...
no .
it &apos;s not possible . i don &apos;t have twins .
yes , you do .
you have twins that have been homeless
ever since their mother passed away .
you have twins who have been living in an abandoned house
because they don &apos;t want to be separated from each other .
and twins who are about to be shipped off to boston
unless you step up and take responsibility for them .
ow . look ...
i can barely manage this garage .
i can &apos;t manage two kids .
and why are you so sure they &apos;re mine ?
besides the timing ?
have you ever seen this ?
i lost this .
let me guess--12 years and 9 months ago ?
i know it &apos;s a lot . believe me , i know .
a month ago , a kid showed up on my doorstep .
i gave up for adoption , asking for help with ... something .
and i ended up moving here , for him .
i heard about that . it &apos;s the mayor &apos;s son .
but ... staying in town is ...
it &apos;s a lot different than taking them in .
i don &apos;t have my kid because i don &apos;t have a choice .
you do .
those kids did not ask to be brought into this world .
you brought them into this world . you and their mother .
and they need you .
and if you choose not to take them ,
you are gonna have to answer for that every day of your life .
and sooner or later , when they find you--
because believe me , they will find you ...
you &apos;re gonna have to answer to them .
i &apos;m really sorry . i am .
i don &apos;t know anything about being a dad .
if it &apos;s a good home you &apos;re looking for ,
it &apos;s not with me .
hello ?
hey , it &apos;s me .
i need you to come outside right away .
is everything okay ?
don &apos;t say anything in front of the kids , but no , it &apos;s not .
he doesn &apos;t want the kids .
and you don &apos;t want to tell them ?
i can &apos;t , because all i &apos;ll be telling them
is that the false hope i gave them is exactly that .
the truth can be painful , emma , but it can also be cathartic .
i agree on the painful part .
well , hey , look , you told henry the truth-- that his father &apos;s dead--
and he &apos;s handling it great .
i didn &apos;t tell him the truth .
what ?
henry &apos;s father was no hero ,
and trust me , he does not need to know the real story .
maybe we can hide the kids ,
just until we can find a family for them--
someone to take care of them .
yes , hiding the 12 year olds is a good plan .
you have a better idea ?
or maybe there isn &apos;t an idea .
maybe you just have--
sheriff ?
shouldn &apos;t you be on the interstate ?
what are you doing here ?
seeing to it that you do your job .
you know you don &apos;t need to check up on me .
i know what i have to do .
really ?
because those kids are supposed to be in boston tonight .
where are you ?
yes .
nice and tender .
a succulent roast you &apos;ll make .
quick ! she &apos;s gonna cook me !
we gotta do something quick !
stay calm .
when she opens the cage to get you , don &apos;t try to fight .
then while she &apos;s carrying you to the oven ,
grab the key that &apos;s in her pocket
and toss it to me through the bars .
she &apos;s coming . she &apos;s coming .
i can &apos;t do it . i &apos;m gonna die !
gravy or butter ?
what shall it be ?
come with me , little boy .
gravy or butter ?
gravy ...
or butter ? !
how shall i baste you ?
butter it is .
time to cook .
quick , gretel ! lock her in !
let me out !
let me out ! you come back right now !
let me out !
you &apos;ll pay for this !
let me out !
i would &apos;ve gone gravy .
my dear children .
were you successful in your task ?
yes , your majesty .
though we were almost made into dinner .
oh , how barbaric .
now ...
if i could have my satchel .
i &apos;ve waited a very long time for this .
let &apos;s hope you didn &apos;t let me down .
you did it .
yeah , we did .
you &apos;ve got a strong heart , girl .
you remind me of myself at your age .
we did all that ...
for an apple ?
oh , trust me , dear boy , this is not just an apple .
it &apos;s a weapon .
a weapon for a very particular and devious enemy ,
one who &apos;s still under the illusion ...
that she &apos;s safe .
whatever your plan is ,
we did what you asked .
now you have to keep your promise and find our father .
of course .
to reunite your family ,
so you can live happily ever after .
you were left alone in the woods .
you deserve better than
a father who would abandon you ,
but he &apos;s all we have .
perhaps he doesn &apos;t have to be .
what do you mean ?
you and your brother have impressed me .
you aren &apos;t the first boy or girl that i &apos;ve sent into that
sticky , sweet house ,
but you are the first to emerge .
and as a reward ,
i &apos;ve decided to invite the two of you to live with me ,
here .
you mean that we get to live in a castle ?
yes .
you would have your own rooms , of course ,
personal carriages and valets , too .
all of your dreams could come true .
no .
we want our father back .
he would never abandon us .
and even if he did ,
we would never want to live with someone as terrible as you .
is that so ?
yes .
we &apos;re going to find him , with or without your help .
and when we do , we &apos;re going to prove you wrong .
we &apos;ll see about that .
gretel , what &apos;s happening ?
come on .
it &apos;s gonna be--
here .
i &apos;m sorry ,
but we gotta go .
let &apos;s go , henry .
no . you can &apos;t take them .
they can &apos;t leave storybrooke , emma .
they can &apos;t .
something bad will happen .
something bad has already happened .
you &apos;ve gotta be kidding me .
what happened ? what &apos;s wrong ?
engine stalled .
who are you calling ?
help .
now she &apos;s cavorting with dwarves ?
when did that happen ?
your majesty , the prisoner you requested is here .
bring him in .
i demand to be released .
my children are in that forest
that you took me from--alone .
they could be in great danger .
yes , i know all about your children .
that compass you gave sweet little gretel--
well , i &apos;m afraid it didn &apos;t help her find you though , now did it ?
what have you done with them ?
you tell me where they are !
gone .
i told them you abandoned them ,
leaving nothing but a compass to find their way .
but i didn &apos;t bring you here to answer your questions .
you &apos;re here to answer mine .
i offered your children everything ,
whatever their hearts desired ,
and they still chose uncertainty
because of their blind faith in you .
tell me why .
why did your children refuse me ?
because we &apos;re a family .
and family always finds one another .
release him .
you &apos;re letting me go ?
you can all be together as a family ...
as soon as you all find one another .
hansel , wake up .
hansel .
she let us go .
i &apos;m scared .
don &apos;t be .
everything &apos;ll be fine .
nicholas , look .
those are them ?
those are them .
and your car ? it &apos;s fine ?
i just wanted you to see &apos; em .
just once .
i didn &apos;t think i could do it either .
i gave up henry &apos; cause i wanted to give him his best shot .
when i saw that he didn &apos;t have it ,
i couldn &apos;t leave .
i was just as scared , more probably .
but once i saw him , got to know him ...
i couldn &apos;t go back .
you &apos;re taking them ?
to boston ?
i don &apos;t have to .
no .
you don &apos;t .
what happened ?
their dad ?
he showed up .
changed his mind .
changed his mind ?
just like that ?
he might have had a little nudge .
they found their father .
that &apos;s great .
i wonder what that would be like .
maybe you &apos;ll find out .
you can &apos;t give up .
i don &apos;t know .
i kinda think giving up might be the best plan .
i think i need to let go .
no , you don &apos;t .
really ...
if they wanted to know me ,
they wouldn &apos;t make it so hard to look .
maybe .
but maybe there &apos;s other reasons .
maybe there is an explanation .
if there is , it &apos;s something crazy--
something even crazier than henry &apos;s theory .
yeah , what &apos;s henry &apos;s theory ?
that my parents put me in a magical wardrobe
and sent me to this world to save them .
and who does he think they are ?
for one ...
you .
me ?
well , snow white .
snow white has a kid .
apparently , that book you gave him--
not exactly the stories in the most traditional sense .
i have a kid .
you &apos;d think i &apos;d remember that .
yeah , you &apos;d think .
you do kind of have my chin .
i think i need to go get some air .
i &apos;m gonna go think .
if you &apos;re gonna be back late , i can wait to eat with you .
no , don &apos;t do that .
i &apos;ll leave you leftovers .
what a pretty blanket .
thanks .
good night .
无良父母依旧无线索
um , what &apos;s that ?
just an old file . what &apos;s up ?
pumpkin pie .
i ... i thought you &apos;d like some .
it was pumpkin , right ?
right .
henry ...
about your father ...
yeah ?
i &apos;m glad i told you .
me , too .
gimme that .
what you did with ava and nicholas--
you really are changing things .
is this storybrooke ?
yeah .
any place to get a room around here ?
uh , you &apos;re staying ?
that &apos;s the plan .
just looking for a bed .
granny &apos;s bed and breakfast is just up the road .
another two blocks .
thank you .
hey . i didn &apos;t catch your name .
that &apos;s &apos; cause i didn &apos;t give it .
i thought you said strangers don &apos;t come to storybrooke .
they don &apos;t .
