my class , no running .
let &apos;s form one straight line .
i wish ...
okay , kids , everyone in line
on the count of three .
one , two , three !
michael b. ,
i &apos;m surprised i have to tell you twice .
let &apos;s go .
but , miss johnson , the statue is bleeding .
my class , everyone here -- now !
well , i think it would be cleaner if you just ...
i think it would be cleaner if you don &apos;t make me hurt you .
oh , go back to your autopsy cave .
i can &apos;t wait to see his face when he sees his new desk .
now , are you certain that frankie has this in the sack ?
in the bag , maura .
cavanaugh said it &apos;s
between him and someone from another unit ,
so it &apos;s got to be frankie .
are you giving him the chogokin doll ?
action figure .
yeah .
make him feel good on his first day .
he needs a proper welcome .
we superglued your desk drawers your first day .
yeah .
yeah , they still stick .
oh , there &apos;s lieutenant cavanaugh .
frankie &apos;s in a suit .
somebody &apos;s getting promoted .
please let it be good news .
morning .
you know , it &apos;s a big deal when we promote someone
to the homicide squad .
today , that honor goes to somebody who &apos;s been out there ,
putting their life on the line for a number of years .
please say hello to detective riley cooper .
congratulations .
sergeant detective vince korsak .
welcome .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry we met under such
weird circumstances .
yeah . me , too .
welcome aboard .
thank you .
homicide &apos;s been a dream of mine for a long time .
really ? was part of that dream playing us both for fools ?
hey , i &apos;m sorry .
no , frost .
you never worked undercover . it &apos;s not easy .
oh , so that makes it okay that you used us
to get information so you could get the promotion ?
frankie , i &apos;m so sorry .
no . c &apos;est la vie .
oh , you &apos;re smart .
now , i &apos;ll give you that .
it &apos;s not the best way to introduce yourself to us .
yeah , i know .
so , you knew who i was when you moved across the hall ?
i was living in a u.c. pad .
stuff went down .
i feel safer living near another cop .
excuse me .
rizzoli .
detective cooper ?
yeah .
get familiar with these open cases .
okay .
welcome to homicide .
we got a possible body dump near grant museum of fine arts .
jane , give riley your open cases .
i spent a year setting up that final bust .
i couldn &apos;t afford to let anyone know who i was .
i understand .
the part i &apos;m having trouble with
is the part where you led on my partner and my brother .
i actually like &apos; em -- both of them .
good .
then you &apos;ll figure out a way to make it right .
frankie has a right to be upset .
she did earn it .
i mean , she &apos;s been a detective in the drug unit for five years .
disappointment is a dangerous emotion if
it isn &apos;t processed .
i &apos;d just hate to see him set himself up for a life of misery .
no , that &apos;s ridiculous .
well , read the research .
and i &apos;m worried about your mother , too .
she &apos;s knitting .
oh , yes . that is worrisome .
i think it &apos;s a baby blanket .
the yarn is a 50 @-@ 50 cotton @-@ acrylic blend .
okay , yes . now we do have a problem .
all units , be on the lookout for a woman
who is so desperate to be a grandmother ,
she &apos;s knitting a blanket for the baby of lydia ,
the slut who slept with her ex @-@ husband
and her youngest son .
she &apos;s worried about what kind of future that baby &apos;s gonna have .
and i &apos;m not ?
lydia could barely tie her own shoes .
easy , there .
let &apos;s turn her .
what , did you pull something ?
i smell something -- decomposition .
let &apos;s tilt her sideways first .
i cannot believe you can smell decomp in bronze .
well , it &apos;s a heavy particulate odor
detectable by some animals for miles .
looks like the venus de milo .
i &apos;ve been to the louvre , dr. snob .
no ! oh !
it &apos;s not bronze . it &apos;s plaster .
she &apos;s very cool .
a dead woman masquerading as a statue is cool ?
no , the body -- it &apos;s cold ,
and it &apos;s exhibiting signs of delayed decomposition .
so , she was frozen ?
no , likely kept in cold storage .
so , &quot; refrigerated , &quot; not &quot; frozen . &quot; got that ?
the difference between 32 and 33 degrees is enormous , jane .
museum was updating their electrical system .
no power to the cameras .
so , no security footage ?
what about the maintenance crew ?
the last guy here says
he fished trash out of the water
just before he left at 7 : 00 .
she wasn &apos;t there yet .
whoever killed her went to an awful lot of trouble
and took a huge risk .
okay , i think it sucks .
ma , you &apos;re like a truck driver
since you started working here .
yeah , whatever .
i &apos;m sorry , frankie .
however , i think it &apos;s an excellent opportunity
to start , you know ,
practicing recovering from disappointment --
not now , maura .
no , it &apos;s fine . i don &apos;t care .
i care .
what a deceptive little bitch .
ma !
okay . riley was already a detective .
you mean a professional liar ?
she went out with me and frost
to get information on the homicide squad .
i think you should protest .
ma , come on . what &apos;s he gonna do ,
walk around with a sign ?
that could actually increase feelings of disappointment .
look ...
all right , you got to strap &apos; em on ,
take this like a cop , okay ?
frankie , come on .
you &apos;ll get your turn .
no , i won &apos;t .
i &apos;m gonna be taking 911 calls for the rest of my life .
aw , frankie , come on .
oh , my god . what is he doing here ?
good question .
isn &apos;t he the really handsome guy you used to go out with ?
the one that never called again ?
maura , just who i was looking
oh , sorry .
that guy seems a little down .
maybe i should give him a copy of my book .
&quot; release your inner
winner and win . &quot;
yeah .
nice photo .
oh , thank you .
it &apos;s on the best sellers list .
congratulations .
thank you .
detective , we should get started on the autopsy .
yes .
uh , oh , can i -- can i just talk to you for a second ?
i &apos;ve been traveling , promoting my book .
i @-@ i should &apos;ve called or at least sent an e @-@ mail .
yeah , you should &apos;ve .
ma .
i &apos;m having a book signing today .
it &apos;s right down the street .
it &apos;d mean so much to me if you could come .
i can &apos;t .
and excuse me . we do need to get back to work .
oh , it is going to be a long day .
i &apos;m fine .
no , you &apos;re not .
you like that idiot .
oh , shh ! i do not .
oh , please . you so do , too .
he disappears for three months ,
and now i &apos;m supposed to just drop everything
to be a groupie at his book signing ?
i think you &apos;d make a good groupie .
&quot; oh , dennis .
will you release my inner winner ? &quot;
that &apos;s good . you should go .
how about i release my inner bitch ?
any guy who spends that much time grooming
is not someone you want to share a bathroom with .
did you notice
the cruella de vil streak in her hair ?
hypopigmentation .
she &apos;s got track marks on her neck .
it &apos;s a long @-@ term junkie
if she &apos;s using the jugular vein .
how long was she kept in cold storage
before she was turned into a statue ?
i could narrow it down to between two to six months .
oh , yes . gee , that is narrow .
can &apos;t you find some freezer fuzz to help out ?
you could store a body
right above freezing temperatures indefinitely .
it took dennis three months
to take me out of cold storage .
maura , let that jerk go .
i am trying .
she appears to be in her 50s .
cause of death was asphyxiation .
no dental care for decades .
so we can &apos;t identify her with dental records .
and without hands --
uh , yes . thank you , maura .
yes , no fingers , no fingerprints .
yes .
i , uh -- i checked vicap
i found four unsolved murders of prostitutes
in minneapolis ,
st. paul ,
jacksonville ,
and st. louis ,
all strangled .
were any of them put in cold storage before they were dumped ?
no , but look at this .
all of them had their arms cut off
and all were encased in plaster .
did any of them have
the deep cuts in their face like this one ?
no .
so , this one was more personal .
we &apos;re looking for a serial killer .
forensic psychiatry research indicates
that most serial killers are men --
with overwhelming hostility and rage toward women ,
often their mothers .
and displaying his &quot; work &quot; means he has a massive ego .
he wants recognition .
frost , where were the other four women found ?
two playgrounds , a t @-@ ball field ,
and in front of a daycare center .
all locations used by kids .
and the four other women were prostitutes .
maybe that &apos;s where we start with our victim .
you ever work bay village ?
yeah . what do you need ?
can you take that around ,
see if anybody recognizes her ?
yeah .
thanks .
make her work the open cases . i &apos;ll go .
that &apos;s a good idea , frost .
detective frost is gonna go with you .
what ?
riley &apos;s a homicide detective now .
you make it work .
fine . i am a professional .
good . take frankie with you .
remind him he &apos;s a professional , too .
you got any pants ?
in my car . why ?
a skirt won &apos;t help you in homicide .
how &apos;s it going ?
fantastic . she &apos;s fitting right in .
you know , the head of the drug unit showed me her record .
pretty impressive .
she got long @-@ term undercover ,
and she got big scores because of her work .
yeah . i mean , she deserves the spot .
i don &apos;t have a problem with her .
well , i &apos;m glad to hear that , rizzoli .
you know , she has almost as much potential as you did .
but i &apos;m never gonna see another jane rizzoli .
thank you , sir .
you think cavanaugh was saying
that frankie isn &apos;t gonna get his gold badge ?
maura ?
maura ?
ow ! what was that for ?
i hate to be ignored .
dennis ignored me for three months .
oh , my god .
like , he didn &apos;t even text ?
really ? you want to know busy ?
like , i &apos;m supposed to be solving a serial murder .
i have never once had an inner monologue like that .
okay .
trace report is back .
the plaster is a common type used in construction .
i also found these burns on the soles of our victim &apos;s feet .
so , the killer put out his cigarettes .
likely inflicted perimortem .
so , he tortured her while he was killing her .
what else ?
delivered one child via cesarean section ,
then had a tubal @-@ ligation procedure .
healed scar tissue indicates it was 30 to 40 years ago .
so , i &apos;m guessing she didn &apos;t want a house full of kids .
okay , let &apos;s go . it starts in 15 minutes .
what starts ?
the book signing .
the one you &apos;re not going to ?
i changed my mind .
i didn &apos;t .
the lab results are gonna take about 30 minutes ,
and i haven &apos;t had a lunch break in three years .
i &apos;m not spending a lunch hour that i never take
listening to dennis &quot; i love myself &quot; rockmond .
that sounds like a character from &quot; the flintstones . &quot;
hi , i &apos;m dennis rockmond .
maura .
maura !
what ?
hey , man , did you ...
did i what -- sleep with her ?
why ? did you ?
nothing here .
so , detective , what &apos;s your next move ?
i &apos;m just a lowly uniform .
and i &apos;ve never been undercover .
what should we do , detective ?
you could start by growing up .
this from a woman
who practically showed us her nipples at &quot; hello . &quot;
detective frost , how old is the victim ?
50s , maybe .
could be why no one recognizes her .
oh , i can &apos;t keep up with all this complicated detective talk .
excuse me .
do you recognize her ?
oh , sure . that &apos;s cruella .
cruella ?
yeah . evil @-@ ass cruella .
i know &apos; cause she had that little skunk streak
right here .
looking up &quot; cruella &quot; in the alias file .
listen , rose , when did you last see cruella ?
oh , beats me . that was one evil heifer .
be yellin &apos; at me from across the street .
&quot; hey , ho ! i got your tricks !
what you gonna do about it ? &quot;
did , uh , cruella have any regulars ?
oh , child , she was lucky to make enough
just to feed that fix of hers .
got a name -- rachel dugan , 54 years old .
you sure you can &apos;t remember the last time you saw her ?
oh , yeah .
i saw her &apos; bout three months ago .
i remember because i had just bought this wig here .
it &apos;s kind of shedding .
but , uh , how you like it ?
so , here i am --
perfect childhood , loving parents ,
failing out of college and blaming the world .
he &apos;s a very dynamic speaker .
i don &apos;t like him .
when the person that i needed to look at was myself ...
well , how can you say that ?
maura , he didn &apos;t even bother to e @-@ mail you .
but he had speaking engagements .
... i took responsibility for my life ...
but why don &apos;t you like him ?
... and i found ...
i don &apos;t like his hair .
or his teeth .
so , i want to thank you all
for your own commitment to releasing your inner winner .
thank you guys for coming .
thank you .
don &apos;t forget -- your inner bitch .
maura , i &apos;m so glad you came .
ah , detective .
oh , no . not a hugger , remember ?
oh , that &apos;s right .
uh , listen , will you have coffee with me ?
i &apos;ll just sign a few books , and then we &apos;ll be out of here .
please , please , please ?
oh , gosh , maura .
i &apos;m just desperate to get back to our case .
aren &apos;t you ?
um , yes .
thank you . i can &apos;t .
okay .
great talk . good luck with the book sales .
maura , come on .
it was good to see you .
you , too .
what is it ?
we &apos;ve got another body dump .
ride &apos;s been closed for repairs .
911 caller saw the thing spinning and called it in .
okay . can somebody turn off this merry @-@ go @-@ round ?
carousel .
1926 spillman eng / looff original .
extremely fine , hand @-@ carved horses .
yeah , with an extremely un @-@ fine ,
hand @-@ carved corpse riding it .
listen , i got uniforms holding &apos; em back ,
but the media are going nuts .
can you blame &apos; em ?
dead women inside statues
is a hell of a lot sexier than a city council meeting .
well , we got to manage this .
we &apos;re working it as hard as we can , sir .
a killer who takes this kind of risk
is gonna be hard to stop .
jane , you &apos;ve got to see this .
what , another power outage with the security cameras ?
no . this guy is smart .
the i.q. of most serial killers
falls between 105 and 120 points .
well , this guy is ted bundy .
look what he did with the security cameras .
he took out the cameras with a laser pointer .
crap . there goes my fishing trip .
six dismembered bodies ,
all dumped in places that cater to children .
this is ego , jane .
he wants us to know these statues .
these dead women are his creations .
what is it ? what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . it just reminds me of hoyt .
jane , he &apos;s dead .
but he trained two apprentices .
there could be another one out there .
my head went there , too , jane .
okay , frost .
can you see if there were any persons of interest
on those other cases with a tie to hoyt ?
on it .
same cause of death -- asphyxiation .
was this one refrigerated ?
nope . death occurred in the last 24 hours .
cigarette burns .
yes . i &apos;ve noted them .
she recently stopped lactating .
she just had a baby ?
second victim &apos;s tox screen came back .
this one &apos;s positive for heroin , too .
thanks .
i found evidence of scar tissue
indicating excessive sexual activity .
so , another junkie prostitute ?
maybe we &apos;re looking for a trucker .
could the first body have been kept in a refrigerated truck ?
it &apos;s possible .
i just find it interesting that the majority of serial killers
aren &apos;t reclusive social misfits or monsters .
i find it terrifying .
i think the guy that shovels your driveway is a serial killer .
you do ?
no , but i don &apos;t know
if even i could tell that he was .
okay . i &apos;m gonna go show this around .
what , now ? it &apos;s 9 : 00 at night .
yeah , well , i can &apos;t go home
knowing this animal is out there .
jane ...
yeah ?
did you notice that i didn &apos;t mention dennis ?
yes , you did .
thank you .
we &apos;re striking out in bay village .
i texted rondo .
he &apos;s always in the combat zone .
maybe he can help us .
how &apos;s it going with riley ?
oh , me and frankie are holding steady with the grudge .
that &apos;s productive .
vanilla !
you see that ?
you ring , i come runnin &apos; .
oh , you workin &apos; with the brother ?
yes , she is . hey , rondo .
we think she works combat zone . you ever seen her ?
oh , yeah , sure . that &apos;s chrissy .
can you give us anything more --
a nickname , maybe ?
i think ... i think she goes by ...
uh ... i think she goes by ...
rainbow .
she services the , uh , hardcore johns .
you know the names of any of her johns ?
nah , nah . they ain &apos;t too friendly .
jane , i think i got her . christine sullivan .
wait , wait , wait , wait . that &apos;s my homey .
she &apos;ll be able to tell us .
kitty !
come on .
hey , kitty , hey .
these are my friends .
somebody killed one of the girls in the zone .
oh , no ! poor rainbow !
um , did she have regulars ?
sure . lots of &apos; em .
did somebody choke her ?
how &apos;d you know that ?
it was bear . had to be .
who &apos;s bear ?
he pays you extra if you let him choke you .
rainbow needed to feed that habit . she &apos;d do anything .
can you give us a description ?
white ? black ?
a white guy .
did you see his vehicle ?
he drives a blue pickup .
did you ever see anything in the back of the truck ?
tools and things . i think he does construction .
construction .
plaster , frost .
okay . thanks , rondo . thank you , kitty .
so , let &apos;s put a bolo out .
we &apos;ll check construction sites tomorrow .
i haven &apos;t been training this bonsai .
it &apos;s getting too big .
oh , you should try knitting . it &apos;s very soothing .
unless you &apos;re knitting it for a baby
that could be your husband &apos;s love child
or your first grandchild .
oh , angela , i &apos;m so sorry .
i wish i could just walk away .
but that baby didn &apos;t have anything to do with
how he or she got made .
are you expecting someone ?
it might be amazon .
i ordered some more of this soft yarn .
they deliver late .
dennis .
hi .
i know it &apos;s late . i couldn &apos;t sleep .
i need to tell you something .
okay . come in .
oh . hello .
hey .
hi . good night .
uh ... it &apos;s for you .
thank you .
well , you know , the day you saved me --
literally brought me back to life
on that autopsy table -- all i planned to do was thank you .
you did thank me .
and i &apos;m a doctor , dennis , so you don &apos;t owe me anything .
i know . it &apos;s -- it &apos;s not that . it &apos;s ...
look , it &apos;s --
my parents , they have the perfect marriage --
30 years and they &apos;re still in love .
they &apos;re soulmates .
why are you telling me this ?
i was so knocked over by you that -- that i got afraid .
and i jumped on a plane . i buried myself in work .
i tried everything not to think about you .
you did ?
yeah . i did .
i want what my parents have ,
and i never thought that i &apos;d find it .
but ...
with you ...
... it feels possible .
well , you either got a lot of sleep ,
or you did some sleeping that didn &apos;t involve sleeping .
dennis stopped by . mm @-@ hmm .
but i didn &apos;t sleep with him . i haven &apos;t slept with him .
the last time , it was because , um , well , i hadn &apos;t made my bed .
what stopped you this time ? what , visible dust bunnies ?
good . keep playing hard @-@ to @-@ get .
okay , they picked up our suspect and his vehicle .
todd brown , nicknamed &quot; bear . &quot;
oh , i always wanted a good nickname .
what &apos;s wrong with &quot; poindexter &quot; ?
the same thing that &apos;s wrong with &quot; roly @-@ poly &quot; rizzoli .
maura !
all right , well , come on .
i need you to observe mr. bear .
what ? i have work to do downstairs .
please ?
you &apos;re the one with the degree in forensic psychiatry .
no , i did one clinical rotation in behavioral neuroscience .
that &apos;s one more than me .
we need to determine if this guy is our serial killer .
i should examine him in a medical setting .
get in !
you can &apos;t do this -- arrest me and seize my truck !
i think we just did . sit down .
make yourself comfortable .
we &apos;ve got a little time while our team tears your truck apart .
i got to tell you , mr. brown , we really admire your work .
don &apos;t show me dead hookers .
i didn &apos;t say they were hookers .
we have a witness who &apos;s
seen you with this hooker , christine sullivan .
so ? i &apos;ve been with a lot of hookers ,
and i &apos;m not looking at their faces .
besides , i got back problems .
i can &apos;t even lift my own toolbox right now .
i &apos;m not out there cutting up hookers .
excuse me while i consult with my colleague .
what do you think ?
well , he seems to be rationalizing maladaptive behavior .
what does that mean ?
well , psychopaths have a sparse emotional life .
he doesn &apos;t appear to be a psychopath .
his emotions feel genuine .
he threw construction tools at the officers who arrested him .
i mean , that says he &apos;s easily provoked and violent .
ask him about his nickname .
okay .
where &apos;d you get the nickname &quot; bear ? &quot;
when i was a kid , i looked really cuddly and chubby .
and when some kid called me &quot; bear , &quot;
i beat the living crap out of him .
name stuck .
okay , bear .
we &apos;re charging you with assault with a deadly weapon .
what ? !
the trowel that you threw at the two officers ?
that &apos;s against the law .
we found plaster of paris in the back of his truck .
we have hookers who can testify he choked them .
we need to know if he has any connection to charles hoyt .
hoyt liked to have other nut jobs kill for him .
plus , brown was in the military .
i &apos;m gonna run his records .
i &apos;ll check credit cards .
maybe we can tie him to cities where we had body dumps .
jane , what is it ?
uh , looks like a letter from the killer .
&quot; dear boss , do you like my work ?
make sure you don &apos;t give the wrong sculptor credit .
i &apos;m about to sculpt my finest piece of work . &quot;
we got another body .
what ? where ?
the zoo .
oh , i can see the headlines now --
&quot; medical examiner sniffs out clues . &quot;
heavy particulate odor .
there is definitely a body inside .
that is why we &apos;re here .
you &apos;re not gonna believe this .
he took out the security cameras again .
how the hell is he doing this right under our noses ?
what is it , frost ?
i just got an e @-@ mail from a st. paul homicide detective
working their dismembered prostitute case .
and ? any connection to hoyt ?
his name is frederick stone .
you &apos;re scaring me , frost . cut to the chase .
frederick stone once shared a cell with charles hoyt .
i &apos;m not seeing any bruising
to indicate that this victim fought back .
same as the other two --
probably because they were nodding out on heroin .
maybe she was , too .
here &apos;s the tox screen on the third victim .
thanks .
not heroin .
but she tested positive for very high levels of cocaine .
well , that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
cocaine would make her agitated ,
so why wouldn &apos;t she fight back ?
unless she was given a sedative .
susie , run a wider panel .
check for sedatives .
latent checked . trace checked . dna lab checked .
there &apos;s nothing on the letter or the envelope .
told you he was smart .
that &apos;s why we have seven bodies .
maura , there has to be a way to figure out
how long cruella was in cold storage .
two to six months is -- is a pretty big window .
well , there &apos;s no traces of mold ,
which indicate that she was kept in a controlled environment
at exactly 33 degrees .
so , the window could actually be much larger --
several weeks to many months .
did you make it larger
because i said i hated dennis &apos; hair ?
no .
possibly .
hives .
serves you right .
so , maybe frederick killed cruella ,
stuck her in a refrigerator , and then went on a killing spree .
one per city till he got back to boston ?
this does seem like home .
what ?
what is it ?
can you guys keep this moving ?
something &apos;s up with my mother .
relax . breathe .
oh , it hurts !
jane ! help ! i think lydia is going into labor .
a maternity ward &apos;s a great place to have a baby .
you want me to call your mom , have her meet you there ?
no , no , no . she hates kids , especially babies .
and there is no way i am going to a hospital .
she already sent away a team of paramedics .
i left a message for tommy to tell him to get over here .
it &apos;s his baby . he has to know .
what if it &apos;s dad &apos;s ?
oh , he tore up his parent card
when he slept with someone younger than us .
i want my baby to be born with his family .
okay , we need to get her to a hospital .
oh , no . i am an adult .
you cannot make me go there if i don &apos;t want to .
this is not your family .
why did you come here ?
it &apos;s my baby &apos;s family , and you &apos;re such good people .
my little baby didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
frankie , you pulled me off a car @-@ washing job .
what &apos;s the emergency ? you lose your handcuffs ?
lydia ?
tommy ?
uh , hey . uh , good to see you .
oh , my gosh .
false alarm .
oh , mrs. rizzoli , do you think you could forgive me ?
i &apos;d love a hamburger .
oh , me , too .
okay . i &apos;m a little conflicted here , okay ?
you had intimate relationships
with both tommy and my creep of an ex @-@ husband ,
and you never bothered to tell me
who you were when we met ?
oh , i can see why you don &apos;t want to get her a burger ,
but what did i do ?
that !
i didn &apos;t do that .
did i do that ?
maybe .
i &apos;m really sorry , mrs. rizzoli , you know ?
but now that i &apos;m bringing a new life into this world ,
i &apos;m gonna turn over a new leaf .
and what about you , thomas ?
well , i &apos;m definitely wearing condoms from now on .
okay , as a sign of goodwill ,
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m gonna make you both burgers .
but nobody is gonna call me &quot; grandma &quot;
until i know who the father of that baby is .
what ?
so , what &apos;s the plan now , dad ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe i could get a job painting houses .
he &apos;s totally ready to become a father .
wait , whoa , whoa . where are you going ?
i &apos;m sorry , frankie .
i got three dead women , okay ?
i &apos;m going back to my case .
no . jane . jane !
maura ?
oh , my god .
you scared me .
i am so sorry .
i @-@ i -- it &apos;s probably not okay
that i came through the back , is it ?
well , now that you have , why did you ?
well , it &apos;s my birthday .
happy birthday .
and i @-@ i needed to come here today .
i wanted to relive the highest and the lowest parts of my year .
this is , uh -- this is where they wheeled me in .
you &apos;d been declared dead .
yeah .
if it wasn &apos;t for you , i &apos;d be in the ground .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sure you probably can &apos;t , but ...
but what ?
i would give anything to celebrate my birthday with you .
uh , well , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m actually waiting on some results .
birthday dinner ?
wow . yes . that
that would be -- that would be incredible .
got an i.d. on the third victim --
21 @-@ year @-@ old debbie rowlings .
prostitute ?
yeah . she was also arrested for child endangerment .
her newborn was taken from her a few weeks ago .
another new mother .
frost , did the other four victims all have children ?
yeah . looks like it .
so , our killer deeply resents mothers .
all the drop locations are symbolic to him
and seem like a big &quot; &apos; f &apos; you &quot; to mothers and children .
why cut off their arms and pose them like statues ?
well , the venus de milo is aphrodite ,
the goddess of love and beauty .
it says here the arms broke off
and the draping &apos;s supposed to make her more sensual and erotic .
so , in our killer &apos;s mind ,
she &apos;s some crazy mixed @-@ up symbol of love and eroticism .
all right .
come on in .
thank you .
what a gorgeous space .
the one thing i hate about my job
is having to be gone from here .
you have a private elevator .
yeah , sorry we had to take the stairs .
i have to get it repaired . oh , careful .
wouldn &apos;t want you falling three stories .
so , how old are you today ?
36 .
yeah , my mom called me this morning to remind me .
she always calls me first thing and sings me &quot; happy birthday . &quot;
that &apos;s very sweet .
yeah . i couldn &apos;t ask for a better mother .
cheers .
cheers .
thanks .
jane , good news .
frederick stone turned up .
where ?
arrested two nights ago in denver on a d.u.i.
still there . couldn &apos;t post bail .
so , he &apos;s not our killer .
nope . and todd brown isn &apos;t our killer .
okay .
all of our victims had really young children
except for rachel dugan , a.k.a. cruella ,
who &apos;s much older than everybody else .
what do we know about her kid ?
think it was a son .
yeah , right here -- mark dugan .
he &apos;d be 36 now .
what happened to him ?
says he was taken away from her
after repeated episodes of abuse .
she ever burn him with cigarettes ?
yeah .
on the soles of his feet .
we need to find him .
he was made a ward of the state when he was 5 .
keep digging , guys .

aw , come o-- find anything on mark dugan ?
should we do something ?
babies are born every day .
we got a serial killer on the loose . you turn around .
i don &apos;t need you passing out .
what &apos;d you find on dugan ?
you want to talk --
you want to talk about that right now ?
what ?
she &apos;s between contractions . talk fast .
well , he bounced around from foster home to foster home .
lots of abuse . he ran away at 8
and found his working @-@ girl , drug @-@ addicted mother .
she abused him some more
before she dragged him back to another foster home .
whoa ! everything okay ?
yeah . fine .
uh , okay .
one of the senior criminalists was looking for you .
tox results are back on the third victim .
do you have them ?
nobody knows me down there .
i &apos;ll see you upstairs .
okay .
come on . i &apos;ll introduce you to everybody .
don &apos;t you want to know if it &apos;s a boy or a girl ?
why don &apos;t you text me when you find out who the father is ?
come on , pop . let &apos;s go .
go where ?
so , i try to make sure that i can be here
whenever dr. isles does an autopsy .
maura ?
hello , detective .
i have the results on the additional tox screen .
oh , great . thanks .
uh , this is detective cooper .
she just joined homicide .
where &apos;s dr. isles ?
oh , i @-@ i think she stepped out
to have dinner with mr. rockmond .
dennis ? hmm .
you found inderal in the third victim &apos;s system ?
oh , no .
what is it ?
inderal was used as a sedative
so the killer could kill our third victim .
dennis rockmond nearly died of an inderal overdose .
i still don &apos;t understand .
and ... he sculpted this hand for maura .
riley , get all units
to dennis rockmond &apos;s address .
frost , get korsak ! meet me outside -- now !
classic art idealized the human form ,
but artists often didn &apos;t understand key aspects ,
like the layering of intercostal muscles .
you do .
i take tremendous pride in everything i do .
that &apos;s probably why
you &apos;re such a wonderful public speaker .
come here . let me show you my work .
dugan , get your hands off of her !
maura , you okay ?
what are you doing ?
look behind you , maura .
you see that pedestal , maura ?
don &apos;t shoot . he &apos;ll cut her throat .
see that ? oh , that &apos;s where i do my real work .
you were gonna be my next creation .
i was gonna honor you .
just like my mother , you gave me life .
you must think you &apos;re real smart , huh , detective ?
no , no , no . no . we &apos;re just lucky .
you &apos;re much smarter than us .
you &apos;re damn right .
not even the genius dr. isles could keep up with me .
please , please !
are you begging me , huh ? keep begging .
god , i like it when they beg .
oh , my god !
no , no , wait , wait , wait ! look , look , look .
we &apos;re all in your hands , okay ?
we &apos;re all in your hands .
you find my mother &apos;s hand ?
yeah .
you understand why i had to take both of them , right ?
so she couldn &apos;t hurt you anymore .
i left my creations at all the places
that i wanted to go with my mommy .
wait ! w @-@ w @-@ wait !
why hurt maura ? come on .
because her healing hands brought me back to this earth !
that &apos;s why !
oh , my god !
and now mothers maybe will finally listen --
treat your kids right .
because you never know who they &apos;ll grow up to be .
oh , my god !
no !
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
how could i not know ?
no . come on . listen .
he evaded four different jurisdictions , okay ?
including us . okay ?
you said it yourself --
they &apos;re not all reclusive monsters , okay ?
you couldn &apos;t have known . you couldn &apos;t have known .
oh , god . i should &apos;ve known .
you haven &apos;t said a word in over an hour , maura .
i &apos;m just trying to process the worst day of my life .
stop beating yourself up , maura .
we all met him .
none of us spotted him .
you know , the best behavioral psychiatrists in the world
will tell you that serial killers get away with it
because they appear so normal .
ugh . why couldn &apos;t you two do something else for a living ?
i thought about being a ballerina .
yes , you did .
and you were so good at the fouette .
and then i wanted to be a goalie in the nhl .
oh , that must be my yarn .
my god , woman .
how much yarn do you need for a baby blanket ?
and speaking of babies , i guess i &apos;ll have to ask girl or boy ?
is it the yarn ?
it &apos;s lydia &apos;s baby .
she left him on the doorstep .
