to our best and final score .
you almost killed me , mozzie .
what do you want , keller ?
this is your last chance to cut me in on your treasure .
remember , i did ask nicely .
now i &apos;m gonna have to make you give me what i want .
neal , it &apos;s time for you to make a choice .
do you want to leave ?
no .
you &apos;re fooling yourself
if you think this is who you really are .
i &apos;ve seen the treasure .
yeah , your boy caffrey &apos;s got it .
and you want it .
you gonna help me or what ?
why would i help you ?
how about you go home
and relax and think about it ?
peter .
he took my wife .
peter ...
swat &apos;s been deployed throughout new york ,
and hrt &apos;s on standby .
we &apos;ve got aerial , ground , marine , electronic surveillance
all up .
checkpoints are everywhere .
we &apos;ll find her , peter .
do we know what keller wants ?
neal .
you have the treasure .
i didn &apos;t steal it , okay ?
you son of a bitch !
i don &apos;t care . you have it .
keller knows .
you &apos;re gonna give it to him
so that i can get my wife back .
yes . whatever you need .
it &apos;s him .
agent burke .
if you &apos;re smart -- and we both know you are --
you &apos;ll keep the fbi off this call .
i am fbi .
no . now you &apos;re just a man who wants his wife back .
let me talk to her .
and why would i let you do that ?
i want to hear her voice .
be careful , mrs. burke .
no passing messages , okay ?
hi , hon .
hi , hon .
you all right ?
yeah , i @-@ i &apos;m okay .
they haven &apos;t hurt me .
i miss you .
i miss you , too .
will you make sure satchmo &apos;s okay ?
you know how is if he hasn &apos;t eaten .
hey . talk time &apos;s over .
i &apos;ll fix this , el .
el ?
you two kids are tugging on my heartstrings here .
so nice to see a married couple
showing love after all this time .
i &apos;d hate to come between that .
so let her go .
i will .
as soon as you hold up your end of it .
the moment i have caffrey &apos;s treasure , she &apos;s all yours .
you have 12 hours .
what &apos;d she say ?
she could have said anything ,
and she asked me about satchmo .
he looks fine .
i know .
think she was passing a code ?
oh , there is it .
oh , i love my wife .
right .
good boy , satchmo .
jones !
good boy .
yeah ?
satchmo bit one of our kidnappers .
there &apos;s blood under satchmo &apos;s chin .
okay , we &apos;ll get a blood kit and run a dna test .
put word out to pharmacies and hospitals
to keep an eye out for anybody with a dog bite .
thanks .
all right .
let &apos;s go , boy .
take me to the treasure .
you &apos;re not gonna tell the bureau about keller ?
not yet .
he knows our playbook better than we do .
let jones and diana focus on finding elizabeth .
we &apos;ll deal with keller .
i drive past this building every morning .
the treasure &apos;s in here ?
i didn &apos;t ask for it .
you could have walked away .
you &apos;re right . i could have .
i didn &apos;t .
and i should be paying for it , not elizabeth .
you &apos;re going to pay for it . right now .
where is it ?
it was here .
peter , it was all here .
oh , god .
he already moved it .
who &apos;s &quot; he &quot; ? he ? mozzie ?
of course it was mozzie . you call him .
i tried .
look , he &apos;s not talking to me . we had a falling out .
what , you couldn &apos;t agree on what island to buy ?
i didn &apos;t think he &apos;d move it this fast .
where &apos;d he take it ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t .
it &apos;s elizabeth .
no lies . i don &apos;t know .
damn it , neal !
mozzie could be anywhere in the world .
we have less than 12 hours to find him .
peter .
we &apos;re gonna get her back .
and we start by finding mozzie .
any luck in finding mozzie ?
no . he &apos;s gone completely to ground .
he &apos;s canceled his emails , his cellphones .
you find anyththing ?
nope . his safe houses are abandoned .
monday through sunday ?
empty .
he probably left the city .
what were you two arguing about ?
mozzie wanted to leave new york .
i didn &apos;t .
why not ?
you .
elizabeth .
sara .
the view out that window .
stepping off the elevator monday morning .
all of it .
i have a life here .
what about mozzie ?
well , he didn &apos;t like to admit it , but , yeah ...
this is his home .
i ran every alias you gave me .
he hasn &apos;t boarded a plane or a boat .
that means he &apos;s thinking it over .
where ?
he wants seclusion .
there &apos;s got to be a way to reach him .
there is .
one way .
i &apos;m looking for estelle .
strange place to find a woman , don &apos;t you think ?
she &apos;s not a woman , but you already know that .
all right . who are you ?
friend of mozzie &apos;s .
i need to get a message to him .
blue eyes . tailored suit .
he told me you might come .
he said to send you away .
cher ami .
during world war i , the lost battalion
was surrounded by german soldiers in the battle of argonne .
every carrier pigeon they sent out for help was killed .
cher ami was their last one .
the lost battalion watched him get shot down .
all hope was lost .
but somehow ,
he took flight again and reached his destination .
saved 200 lives .
and was awarded the croix de guerre .
cher ami means &quot; dear friend . &quot;
mozzie &apos;s dear friend needs him now .
he doesn &apos;t know it ,
but another life needs to be saved .
hey , estelle .
it &apos;s been a long time .
i never knew where you flew to ,
but i think i do now .
mozzie always said
you were the best homer in the city .
we need you .
morning .
thought you could use a fresh cup .
thanks , jones .
dna results came back on the blood from satchmo .
it wasn &apos;t keller &apos;s .
leonard grant .
grant has a history of unpredictable violence .
he has a long rap sheet , including kidnapping .
looks like the kind of guy keller would love .
exactly .
we &apos;re looking into his former contacts now ,
tracing his financial history .
good .
boss , is there anything i can do for you ?
oh ... exactly what you &apos;re doing .
there isn &apos;t anyone i trust more
to spearhead this than you and jones .
what about caffrey ?
he has the treasure , doesn &apos;t he ?
that &apos;s what keller &apos;s after ,
and you &apos;re working that angle .
the less you know , the better right now .
thanks , diana .
okay .
oh , estelle . you &apos;re early .
please ... don &apos;t hurt me .
t @-@ they &apos;ll give you what you want .
they better ,
&apos;cause i got lots of debts to pay ...
especially to the russians ,
so hopefully this will clear them all
in one fell swoop .
besides , the art doesn &apos;t belong to neal anyway .
he &apos;s just the most recent person to steal it .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re taking it .
you are , huh ?
why do you say that ?
neal betrayed my husband , lied to him .
he doesn &apos;t deserve any of it .
wow , you &apos;re good , mrs. b.
i &apos;ll give you that .
no eye contact , identifying with your captor .
i mean , you haven &apos;t even used my name .
everything from the fbi kidnapping playbook , huh ?
the only problem is ...
your husband already knows who i am .
that &apos;s true .
and he and neal are going to kick your ass .
well , listen , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re trying to figure out
how to escape from here ,
so let me make this nice and easy .
this door is your only way in and out .
not even neal could pick this lock .
if i were you ,
my second choice would be this here fire escape .
so unless you have a drill kit hidden in your blouse ,
this is where you &apos;re staying .
but just to make sure --
hey , grant !
i believe you two met earlier , right ?
i &apos;d shake your hand , but ...
so while i &apos;m out meeting your husband ,
grant here will be keeping an eye on you .
how long you gonna be gone ?
what ?
my hand is really starting to hurt .
it &apos;s a scratch .
goodbye , elizabeth burke .
shoot her in the foot if she tries anything .
i want to be prepared if we can &apos;t find mozzie .
what if we tell keller the truth ?
he will think we were stalling .
and he &apos;ll take it out on elizabeth .
maybe we should let the fbi know what keller wants .
they won &apos;t negotiate with kidnappers ,
and i want them focusing on finding el .
well , we don &apos;t have to worry about finding mozzie .
let &apos;s get him up here now .
for once , words fail me .
they can &apos;t possibly convey how sorry i am .
this was keller &apos;s big move . i should have seen this coming .
do you have the treasure ?
yep .
good .
wait ! y @-@ you can &apos;t give it to him .
no , no . once he has it , there &apos;s no reason --
once he has it ,
there &apos;s no reason to keep her alive !
he didn &apos;t even hesitate to kill el .
he &apos;s right , okay ?
but now we have the treasure as a bargaining chip .
el &apos;s only chance ,
my only guarantee that she &apos;ll be safe
is if the fbi finds her .
we &apos;re running out of time , peter .
we need to buy more time .
yeah , but keller &apos;s smart enough to read a stall .
then the three of us have to be smarter than him .
we &apos;ve been playing by keller &apos;s rules .
let &apos;s change the game .
thought you &apos;d be sipping mai tais on a beach by now .
after all that happened ,
i thought some introspection was in order .
i decided to follow in the footsteps of thoreau .
found yourself a nice pond and lived off the land ?
admit it . it &apos;s a hard city to leave .
she &apos;s a stubborn mistress .
go through grant &apos;s accounts .
look for anything that may be a safe house .
this is my fault .
no , it &apos;s mine .
i was the one who took the treasure in the first place .
keller kidnapped elizabeth . you didn &apos;t .
remember that .
what &apos;d the fbi say ?
they have a lead , but they need more time .
we can &apos;t stall the exchange .
peter , if we do , there &apos;s no telling
what keller would do to elizabeth .
where are you keeping the treasure ?
to a secure facility i set up with some associates .
what if we stalled keller
without appearing to stall him ?
well , it &apos;d have to be something out of our control .
keller &apos;s not an easy one to con .
yeah , he &apos;d have to think we were operating in good faith .
we &apos;re gonna have to show him the treasure .
i have an idea .
we &apos;ll need a well @-@ timed call to the police
and a criminal we have no concrete ties to --
someone you wouldn &apos;t mind ratting out .
i know just the rat .
mozzie , i must say ,
after what happened in atlanta ,
i &apos;m surprised to hear from you .
yeah , well , desperation makes for strange bedfellows .
um , can i talk to you without your shadow ?
simon .
look , i have a two @-@ man job that needs to be done today .
i need someone who can crack the best security .
what is the job ?
it &apos;s a benefactor @-@ specified target .
i just picked up the package on the way here .
wait a minute . so you haven &apos;t actually opened it ?
no , i was running late --
so you don &apos;t actually know what the job is ?
i &apos;m sure everything &apos;s in here .
i &apos;ve worked for this guy before .
he &apos;s legit .
i believe you .
oh , come on , rufus .
we both have a chance to make some serious cash here .
well , since you actually don &apos;t know what the job is ,
i guess that i &apos;m gonna be the one
making the serious scratch , and simon , too .
thanks for your help , mate .
damn you , rufus !
how &apos;s your heart rate ?
what ?
if it &apos;s infected , your heart rate will increase .
it &apos;s a scratch .
mm . you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re fine .
unless you start sweating .
and if that happens ?
well , it &apos;s probably blood poisoning .
very common in dog bites .
but you don &apos;t have to believe me .
you can look it up on your phone .
you picturing yourself shooting keller right now ?
no . i don &apos;t want to shoot him .
i want to smash in his face repeatedly .
i &apos;m currently sticking bamboo under his fingernails .
you are one for the classics .
you guys talking about me ?
&apos;cause my ears are burning .
my wife better be safe .
i like to see the passion , burke .
it shows me you &apos;re motivated .
look , she &apos;s fine .
as long as i call in every half hour ,
she &apos;ll stay that way .
is your dog off his leash ?
no anklet .
good boy .
so the treasure &apos;s here ?
it don &apos;t look like much , mozzie .
that &apos;s precisely the point .
what is this place ?
it &apos;s a storage space for honorable thieves --
the kind who wouldn &apos;t steal from other thieves .
no such thing , sweetheart .
must have been hard for you , caffrey , huh ?
lying to your friend &apos;s face
about having the treasure all this time ?
we can do this without the commentary .
you &apos;ve always been good
at lying to those closest to you .
right , moz ?
welcome to container 10 ...
sweetheart .
this is it .
the score of a lifetime .
what do we have here ?
napoleon brought that back from his egypt expedition .
it was in his private collection .
yeah ?
now it &apos;s in mine .
i mean , all this time , caffrey ,
you haven &apos;t been able to see it in person ,
and now you &apos;re gonna have to watch me take it away .
cops ? are you kidding me ?
you think i was bluffing , burke ?
no .
your wife is dead in five minutes if i don &apos;t make that call .
and i &apos;m not gonna be able to do that
with cuffs around my wrists .
this wasn &apos;t us , keller .
well , we can &apos;t get caught here . let &apos;s go .
police !
go ahead .
there should be two in the back !
you two , freeze !
we found these guys breaking into this shipping container .
officer , we weren &apos;t breaking in .
not at all . we own this .
do you also own the printing press
and the counterfeit $ 20s inside ?
he owns it . i &apos;ve never seen it .
you dragged me into this .
all right .
shut up !
i think we should check out the rest of the containers .
i &apos;ll get you .
you guys did this .
you think i would play games
with my wife &apos;s life on the line ?
this wasn &apos;t us .
so , what , this is just some random misfortune ?
we made a deal , keller .
you have the treasure , release my wife .
i don &apos;t have anything , burke .
the cops do .
they &apos;re setting up a perimeter ,
which means they &apos;ll open every container .
well , the police will need warrants to get into them .
that should buy us some time .
for what ?
the three of you do what you do best -- steal it .
not the three of us .
the four of us .
i &apos;m an fbi agent .
today , you &apos;re one of us .
boys , we &apos;re gonna steal back our stolen treasure .
no beer .
caffrey , you &apos;re a terrible host .
that &apos;s &apos; cause i don &apos;t want you here to begin with .
oh , i know .
before i disappear with all your ill @-@ gotten goods ,
i wanted to see where you &apos;ve been holed up .
man , oh , man , you &apos;ve been slumming it .
can we focus ?
the treasure &apos;s in container 10 .
10 , huh ?
&quot; x &quot; marks the spot . you get it ?
police made their arrest here .
this container was already open ,
so they were able to search it .
they filed for warrants for every other container .
those should take a day .
which means we got to move the treasure fast , huh ?
for his wife &apos;s sake .
all right , here &apos;s the police perimeter .
there &apos;s one guard post out front to let people in and out .
there &apos;s a shift change at lunch .
every half hour , the police will only be stationed
outside the building .
that &apos;s our window .
standard police procedure
is they check every hour , on the hour .
so , we subdue the guards
and then we drive the truck in -- boom .
and how do you plan to subdue the cops ?
a bullet in each head .
no . no killing .
in fact , no guns at all .
oh , peter , peter , peter . can i call you peter ?
now that we &apos;re working together and all , huh ?
the cops would have seen our faces , peter .
dead men don &apos;t talk .
i will not let anyone die on this .
that &apos;s not up for debate .
all right , relax . no guns .
it &apos;s probably for the best , huh ?
the little guy &apos;s tried to kill me once already .
yeah , is there anyone in this room
you haven &apos;t tried to kill ?
you .
yet .
but it &apos;s starting to cross my mind , mozzie .
so , how do you suggest we get in ?
fbi received this an hour ago .
the police are asking to borrow cargo trucks
from other branches of the government .
this is our in .
all right , i mean ,
we can get through the perimeter with that , but
they &apos;re not gonna let us run around unsupervised .
but they &apos;ll leave what appears to be an empty truck unmolested .
barcelona , 2001 , huh ?
that &apos;s what you &apos;re thinking , isn &apos;t it ?
it was madrid . but , yeah .
you should have seen it . caffrey was amazing , right ?
we were scamming this coin
let &apos;s stay on task .
you and moz will con the truck past the cops .
once the truck is alone ,
peter and i will emerge
from our hiding place and grab the treasure .
you and peter ?
nice try , kid .
it &apos;ll be you and i stowing away together .
it will be like old times .
that isn &apos;t for debate .
look , i &apos;ve moved the treasure twice .
it needs a big truck .
national guard has some that would work .
i can get us one .
this is gonna be fun , huh ?
who &apos;s excited ? you ?
anyone ?
why didn &apos;t you leave ?
i mean , i know i asked you this before ,
but you had the treasure --
why -- why stay in new york ?
you &apos;ve seen what i have here .
why would i go ?
because everyone you know found out you betrayed them .
you know , there &apos;s a reason why
our kind doesn &apos;t stay anywhere too long , caffrey .
it &apos;s in our nature to deceive .
you &apos;ve been living on the run .
how &apos;s that going for you ?
it &apos;s stressful . i &apos;m not gonna lie .
you know what ?
with this treasure , i can pay off the russians .
disappear somewhere nice .
you &apos;re gonna wish you never had it .
all it brings is trouble .
what do you mean by that ?
the treasure &apos;s cursed ?
it &apos;s a monkey &apos;s paw , huh ?
look what &apos;s happened to everyone who &apos;s gone after it .
maybe you &apos;re just making the wrong kind of wishes .
we &apos;ve got 48 hours
while the truck &apos;s sent in for maintenance .
i procured us some uniforms .
aw , you are gonna look adorable in this , mozzie , huh ?
it &apos;s a shame i removed that price from your head .
eh , put it back on .
you &apos;ll make a great human shield .
time to check in with your missus .
any update ?
jones is working an angle .
it &apos;s a long shot ,
but every hour we buy
gets them closer to finding elizabeth .
we won &apos;t be able to stall again .
if they don &apos;t find her soon ...
we &apos;ll have to go through with the break @-@ in .
the safe house was a decoy .
keller &apos;s playing with us .
what ?
cherry blossoms .
clear the table .
okay , so , listen up .
erts found faint traces of cherry @-@ blossom pollen
on one of the shoe prints at the crime scene .
the pollen we found was of a variety called fugenzo .
now , according to parks and rec ,
only one place has that specific type .
there &apos;s a damn good chance elizabeth can be found
somewhere in this radius .
hit the streets . go door @-@ to @-@ door .
whatever it takes . let &apos;s go .
i could write it for you , if it helps .
don &apos;t talk to me . i &apos;m fine .
if keller comes back late ,
you could always learn to be a lefty .
and you can learn to walk with one foot .
look , it &apos;s new york city .
there &apos;s a pharmacy on every corner .
but without antibiotics ...
i &apos;ll be right back .
don &apos;t move .
where would i go ?
are you okay ?
fine .
you know , the first thing i learned
about the life of a con is that in order to survive ,
you have to look out for yourself .
then why are you here ?
survival is overrated .
and i find myself reminded
that an unshared life is not living .
so you &apos;re saying you care ?
about mrs. suit .
and ...
remind you of the good old days , buddy ?
you &apos;re using all the oxygen .
you see , after that last time ,
we were sneaking out of somewhere
because you got caught in bed with that princess .
i didn &apos;t get caught in bed with her .
they found me on the ledge outside her window .
i remember seeing you standing there
with nothing but a solid @-@ gold tray covering your junk .
i was the one that got you down from there
before they started shooting at you .
you had my back then .
like i said , &quot; the good old days . &quot;
they were .
what happened to you , keller ?
i could ask the same thing to you , neal .
i could ask the same thing to you .
you &apos;ll have to turn around .
this area &apos;s off @-@ limits .
uh , that &apos;s precisely why we &apos;re here .
you got the paperwork ? - yeah .
hey , you
you put out an order for trucks , so we brought you a truck .
i haven &apos;t seen this .
until i see this come through proper channels ,
you &apos;re not coming in .
you &apos;re holding the orders in your hand right now .
sorry , buddy . turn the truck around .
fine .
then this truck is your responsibility .
give me the plans .
why ?
give me the plans .
you see this &quot; x &quot; ?
this truck needs to be parked right on it .
is burke showing that cop our plan ?
look , i &apos;m sure he &apos;s got it under control .
the truck now is your problem .
he &apos;s crazy . i respect that .
yes , it is .
this &quot; x. &quot;
park the truck on it now .
and what if i don &apos;t ?
oh , it &apos;s your ass , not ours .
thanks for your help .
okay , so now
they &apos;ve got our truck and our plans to break in ?
yeah .
what happens if they don &apos;t drive it in ?
they will .
come on . drive it in .
nicely played , suit .
all right , let &apos;s get to the rendezvous point .
all right , we must be there .
the truck hasn &apos;t moved in a while .
it &apos;s five after . everyone should be at lunch .
all right . we got 55 minutes to load everything up .
what is it ?
apparently , they skipped lunch .
we have plainclothes searching the radius , boss ,
we have cellphone interceptors picking up all nearby calls ,
and we have agents on the roofs , scanning the crowd .
good work , diana . - let me talk to him .
peter .
that storage facility you had me looking into ?
yeah ?
whatever they found there , it &apos;s important enough
that they have the 22nd precinct doing double shifts .
that mean working through lunch ?
i guess so .
jones , we need to find her now .
every second counts .
we got a problem .
this is some kind of double @-@ cross .
not everything is an angle , keller .
we should &apos;ve brought guns .
yeah , &apos; cause that would &apos;ve worked out well .
just like old times .
excuse me .
are you the sergeant in charge ? - i am .
good . glad you guys could make it .
look , we got to load container 10 into the truck .
well , our orders are
to wait for the warrant to come in for container 2 .
you &apos;re 22nd precinct , right ? - that &apos;s us .
then you &apos;re here to help us load container 10 .
no , we were told that the warrant for that
wouldn &apos;t be in till the end of the day .
nah , it came through 20 minutes ago .
come on . we &apos;ll show you . we already been there .
now , look , there &apos;s 17 wood boxes that need to be hauled out .
yeah , makes you wonder what &apos;s inside them , right ?
yeah , don &apos;t it ?
but i got told if i looked ,
i &apos;d be working dispatch for a year .
are you sure this is right ?
if not , then why would i have the key ? - yeah .
a bunch of neo @-@ nazis ?
above my pay grade .
how many boxes does that look like , huh ?
it looks like 17 to me .
everybody , change of plans !
we &apos;re emptying this container out .
all right , they &apos;re all yours .
but i need to see the warrant , of course .
of course . we &apos;ll get them to you in a bit .
i got to see it now . you know , procedures and all .
sure .
come with me .
heaviest to the back , if you can .
i hope you understand ,
but things just have to be done a certain way .
yeah , rules are rules . i get it .
where are we going ?
sergeant !
no , no , it &apos;s no trouble at all .
he &apos;s right here , sir .
it &apos;s the d.a. &apos; s office .
they want to touch base with you .
sergeant brubaker .
sergeant , this is the district attorney &apos;s aide .
how can i help clear things up ?
what part of &quot; no killing &quot; do you keep forgetting ?
finding a dead body can take hours .
this lie can fall apart any second .
peter will take care of it .
you really have gone native , haven &apos;t you ?
got it .
it &apos;s all good , gents . thank you .
thank you , sir .
take it easy .
no , you walk in front of me .
we got a hit on the accomplice &apos;s account .
it was used at a pharmacy three blocks away --
rubbing alcohol , antibacterials , and bandages .
sounds like a guy worried about a dog bite .
everybody spread out . he &apos;s in the vicinity .
all right . thanks a lot , guys . appreciate the help .
hey , the beers are on me , right ?
you ready ? - yep . i think we &apos;re good to --
thanks , hon .
okay , i don &apos;t know how the hell you got out of there , but --
my hand !
go ahead .
drop it .
neal &apos;s not picking up . i think something went wrong .
neal ?
disappointed ?
el .
she &apos;s okay ?
i &apos;m safe .
oh , thank god .
they caught the guy holding me .
are you all right ?
i am now . where are you ?
uh , 23rd and 3rd . they &apos;re taking me home .
where &apos;s keller ?
he &apos;s with neal .
i can &apos;t get ahold of him .
go get him .
el .

oh , way ahead of you , suit .
i &apos;ve already mapped out potential escape routes .
from this point , it &apos;s 2.4 miles to the docks
and 16.1 to teterboro .
all right . you take the air , i &apos;ll take the sea ,
and the bureau will back us up on both .
i &apos;m gonna need to get in one of these cars .
oh , already done .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .

first rule of a fight --
always go for the weak spot .
easy there , burke , huh ?
i got the wife . remember that .

&quot; not anymore &quot; ? what are you , bluffing me ?
call your guy .
tell him he can get a great slice of pizza
right at the corner of 23rd and 3rd .
don &apos;t matter ...

and again and again .
did we really get elizabeth ?
we did .
how &apos;d you make that shot ?
long story .
you okay ?
yeah . you ?
what now ?
keller needs to go away forever ,
and to make that happen , i need to give a full confession .
that means prison .
a lot of it .
i know .
i &apos;ll turn myself in tomorrow morning .
that should give you a 12 @-@ hour head start .
the treasure &apos;s gone .
do you think you can survive without it ?
i always have a contingency plan .
if you want a happy ending ,
it depends on where you stop the story .
i think our story stops here .
and ...
ends well .
till the next chapter .
till the next chapter .
good morning , neal .
morning .
how &apos;s elizabeth ?
she &apos;s well , considering .
i know what i &apos;ve done .
and i know what i need to do to take keller down .
i &apos;m ready to make a full confession .
you know what that will mean .
i do .
are you sure ?
you &apos;re willing to give up everything ?
yeah .
i &apos;m glad to hear that .
but before you go any further , i want to show you something .
peter , please .
i need to get this out now .
watch .
what is this ?
keller &apos;s interrogation from last night .
i stole the treasure .
and i was the one that burned down the warehouse
and took it from vincent adler .
adler didn &apos;t deserve it .
it belongs to the people of russia .
i take full responsibility .
i alone recovered this priceless artwork ...
... that was so nearly lost to history .
he took credit for it .
yep .
why ?
he said he &apos;d give a full confession
as long as it was in front of the russian authorities .
the treasure was originally pillaged
from the russian museums .
and now keller claimed that he stole it to save it ,
return it to the motherland .
the russian mob wanted him dead .
yeah , and now they &apos;re helping pay for his legal defense .
son of a bitch .
as far as anyone is concerned ,
he &apos;s the one who recovered the treasure of a lifetime .
not you . not mozzie .
doesn &apos;t bother you ?
no .
it doesn &apos;t .
i know what you were prepared to do .
and it means a lot that you were willing to do it .
what happens now ?
peter . you &apos;re gonna want to see this .
diana .
trust me .
what is it ?
this is a letter from the u.s. probation office .
it is to inform you that a hearing has been scheduled
concerning your probation .
because of your outstanding service ,
including recovering the treasure
and catching keller ,
the u.s. probation office is convening a hearing
to discuss the commutation of your sentence .
what does that mean ?
it means no anklet .
no nothing .
