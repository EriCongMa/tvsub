please , please , please , please .
okay , what is this ?
we &apos;re making sure i &apos;m tall enough
to ride all the rides at disneyland .
without having to spike up my hair .
buddy ...
we are good to go .
sweet !
i have been waiting for this day
ever since the doctor pointed
to the ultrasound of your mom &apos;s womb and said ,
&quot; either that &apos;s a fifth limb ,
or you got a boy . &quot;
okay , no . gross .
all right ... i want everybody to eat a lot at home
because &quot; the happiest place on earth &quot;
is also home to the most expensive churro on earth .
come on . this is gonna be awesome .
who doesn &apos;t love a day at disneyland ?
can &apos;t you and mom go without me ?
you &apos;re the kid . i think we need you to get in .
well , it couldn &apos;t come on a worst day .
the technology sector is tanking .
we &apos;re doing a stock market project in school ,
and today &apos;s the last day .
we all get a thousand fake dollars to invest ,
and as the market closed yesterday ,
i &apos;m in the lead .
i may not be the tallest or the most athletic ,
but someday i will be the richest ,
which is good because the ladies love that ,
and i &apos;ve grown accustomed to a certain lifestyle .
do you really wants girls who only want you for your money ?
i &apos;d like to have that option .
manny , put the stock away and put your ears on .
mom , i don &apos;t think you have to wear one of these .
be a kid ! put them on !
really ? those shoes ?
what ?
do you know how much walking you have to do at disneyland ?
why do you think they have so many fat people on scooters ?
i like wearing the high heels . i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s just like that jacket you refuse to bring
when i say , &quot; take a jacket . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t tell me what to do ! i &apos;m fine ! &quot;
huh ? and you &apos;re not fine .
you &apos;re cold and shivering ,
and i look like the jerk who won &apos;t give his wife a jacket ,
so i do , and then i &apos;m cold and shivering ,
and i brought a jacket .
are you done with your boring jacket story ?
because we &apos;re going to hit traffic .
tell you one thing . i &apos;m not gonna give you my shoes .
ah ! that must be ethan .
who &apos;s ethan ?
didn &apos;t i tell you ?
my friend bethenny &apos;s nephew is coming with us today .
he moved to town to go to college .
he &apos;s very nice , very smart , big hockey player .
i know what you &apos;re doing .
really ? she was so subtle .
haley has a thing for bad boys ,
which was so me .
clearly .
so if she &apos;s going to be leaving the nest soon ,
we &apos;d prefer it was not on the back of a motorcycle .
my college roommate had a motorcycle .
man , i had some good times on the back of that thing .
i can &apos;t believe you did this .
i &apos;m not gonna babysit bethenny &apos;s nephew . alex can have him .
okay , i don &apos;t need your rejects .
hi , ethan ! i &apos;m so glad you could make it .
thanks for inviting me .
sure .
hi . i &apos;m al--
my 14 @-@ year @-@ old sister . ethan , was it ?
yeah .
第三季 第二十二集
and that &apos;s my grandpa and his wife gloria
and her son manny .
wow . you guys have a big family .
big family .
she likes him !
yeah , who wouldn &apos;t ?
where &apos;d you find him , a tommy hilfiger catalog ?
he got a 2200 on his s.a.t.s.
and those eyes ...
okay , did you get him for haley or for you ?
mitchell .
you know , i haven &apos;t been here since dad brought us when we were kids .
ohh , yeah . remember ? you cried in the abraham lincoln thing .
hey , he &apos;s a great president ,
and it was the first robot i ever saw .
when claire and mitchell were young ,
their mom and i were gonna take them to disneyland .
but that morning , dede and i got in this huge fight
over something or other-- surprise , surprise--
and i ended up taking them on my own .
claire &apos;s biggest fear was running into the evil queen .
my biggest fear was that i married her .
okay , people over 46 inches ,
first stop--indiana jones !
have fun on the teacups , lily .
okay , let &apos;s do this .
oh , okay , wait just a second here , everybody .
all right .
is that a leash ?
no , it &apos;s a child safety tether . this way , sweetie .
it--it &apos;s a leash .
don &apos;t--don &apos;t judge us .
go on .
we have a runner .
lily is going through a phase--
at least ... oh , we hope it &apos;s a phase .
she bolts every chance she gets .
lily !
lily !
lily !
so we had no choice
to put her on a child safety tether .
it &apos;s a leash .
and we did have a choice .
lily , sweetie , don &apos;t pull .
lily , heel !
dad .
if i &apos;d had known you guys were gonna do this ,
i &apos;d have brought stella .
it was cam &apos;s idea .
so much for the united front .
i &apos;ll have you know , despite all your jokes , lily enjoys it .
okay , sweetie , you &apos;re not helping . you &apos;re not helping .
oh , my god . oh , my god . you guys , is that dylan ?
what ?
oh , jeez .
dylan ? !
uh , what are you ... i didn &apos;t even know you were in town .
either did i ...
know you were in town .
this town . anaheim .
i thought you were still in wyoming .
i was , uh ...
but , um ...
oh , shoot .
you know , i , uh , gotta meet up with some friends
and i &apos;m ... really late .
it was nice to see you , haley ,
and everybody .
and dude i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m ethan . it &apos;s nice to meet you .
and polite dude i don &apos;t know .
did haley used to date that guy or something ?
yep . you date her , that &apos;s the club you &apos;re joining . mm .
of course he would still look amazing .
does he ? i hadn &apos;t noticed .
did you know that ethan plays the trumpet ?
no great surprise with those lips of his , huh ?
coo @-@ coo @-@ ca @-@ choo , mrs. robinson .
okay , buddy , moment of truth .
yes !
this is gonna be so awesome ! yeah !
in 45 minutes , this is gonna be so awesome !
look , reuben ,
i have some underperformers i have to unload ,
and i don &apos;t have access to a computer .
log in as moneydelgado--
manny !
by all means , reuben ,
go get a popsicle while the nikkei closes .
i wanna be a pauper .
mom , my stocks just took a dive .
your phone is about to take a dive .
come on ! where do we want to go next ?
oh ! ethan and i want to try the haunted mansion .
there is no you and ethan .
let &apos;s go to the jungle cruise . it &apos;s right there .
why ? tired of walking in those heels ?
no . you tired of being with a hot wife ?
well , well , well . what do you know ?
another caring parent with a child safety tether .
see ? we &apos;re not the only people who use them .
hi ! aren &apos;t they adorable ?
oh , and look at your cutie !
oh , well , yes . she just wanted to say hi .
oh . sorry . they &apos;re a little feisty today .
oh ! no problem . she &apos;s friendly .
rex , gentle .
oh , his--his name &apos;s rex , huh ?
yeah .
oh , okay . lily , no , sweetie . lily , um ...
oh . sorry . he--he just gets excited .
oh , yeah , no--oh , no problem .
lily , stop moving , sweetie . stop moving .
okay , you got this .
okay . okay . good girl ! good girl ! sorry .
you know what the fight with dede was about ?
i taped a football game over an episode of &quot; dallas . &quot;
who bails on a family trip to disneyland
over something like that ?
ironically , dallas was playing in the game .
and i remember pointing that out to her ,
and then i remember
a video cassette flying at my head .
you do not play the cello .
i do . even geekier--i &apos;m good .
okay , answer me this--
i will answer you this .
why do people carry cellos around ?
you know , people aren &apos;t expected to lug a piano around .
what &apos;s the cutoff ?
i know , right ? like , go where the cello is .
oh , look at this . i think i &apos;ve inadvertently
set up my 14 @-@ year @-@ old with a college boy .
the boy was your doing ?
yes . yes , and he was perfect ,
and haley was into him until ,
of course , we ran into dylan .
i mean , come on , dad . what are the odds of that happening ?
it &apos;s a small world .
yes , it is .
you see what i did there ?
i did .
&apos;cause it &apos;s a ride .
i got it . got it , dad . i got it .
it &apos;s so frustrating because ...
i know i can &apos;t run haley &apos;s life for her ,
but if she would let me , i would be so good at it .
right , &apos; cause parents always know what &apos;s best for their kids .
you remember that nice girl at the office
i tried to fix mitch up with ?
no offense , dad , but i think i probably have
a better sense of what my kids need than you did .
i think it &apos;s cute you think that .
mom !
it was so awesome !
the jeep was jerking around ...
and--and there was a lot of sharp turns and big drops .
it just kept going .
wow . you okay ?
great . why wouldn &apos;t i be ?
because you &apos;re kinda leaning on me .
well , isn &apos;t that what a marriage is ?
ohh . oh , alex , stop touching him .
oh . you look like hell .
i &apos;m feeling a little dizzy .
i think that ride did something to me .
the fluid in your inner ear is thickening .
that &apos;s what happens when you get old .
it is ?
yeah , you can &apos;t take the motion .
i gotta pop a dramamine to get in my swivel chair .
that is not it . i &apos;m king of the roller coasters .
i think i just put
too big of a whipped cream smile on my pancake this morning .
you guys wanna go on matterhorn ?
luke , i think me and your dad are gonna sit this one out ,
maybe get one them big pickles .
no ! you &apos;re gonna have to eat that pickle on your own , jay .
i still got a few good years left .
luke , wait up !
i &apos;ll race you there !
i &apos;m good . i &apos;m good .
okay , everybody &apos;s looking at us .
i haven &apos;t been judged by this many people
since i forgot my canvas bags at whole foods .
yeah , well , maybe they &apos;re staring
because we have what they want .
whoa ! oh , a pet daughter . &apos; cause that ...
you know , i don &apos;t care what people think .
if i thought it would keep my daughter safe ,
i would have a kangaroo pouch sewn into my midriff .
that &apos;s gonna work out really well for you as a single parent .
okay , we just got a glare from mr. socks @-@ with @-@ sandals .
all right , that &apos;s it .
lily , i &apos;m gonna take off this leash .
i think it &apos;s a mistake .
but i don &apos;t want you to run away ,
&apos;cause that would be very , very unsafe ,
and if we lost you ,
you &apos;d be very scared , and we &apos;d be very sad . okay ?
okay .
all right .
see , cam ? you treat her like a human being
and she acts like one .
chip &apos; n dale !
oh , great . now she &apos;s chasing squirrels . lily !
honey , come on !
lily ! lily !
hey ! how was splash mountain ?
it was great ! maybe we go again .
no , thanks . there was no reception in there .
you know how many bars i had ? zip @-@ a @-@ dee @-@ doo @-@ dah .
reuben , talk to me !
must be nice to get out of those shoes for a minute .
i don &apos;t know what you talking about .
nothing . i &apos;m just making conversation .
hey . check it out .
i bought one of those souvenir photos
with you and manny on the ride .
boy , it looks like you &apos;re having a good time .
wait a minute . what &apos;s that in your hand ?
are those shoes ?
i &apos;m not even sure that that is us , jay .
why are you walking around in pain ?
just admit the shoes were a bad idea .
i am not in pain .
i just didn &apos;t want my favorite walking shoes to get wet there .
okay , my bad .
well , we &apos;ve gotta meet everybody in tomorrowland ,
so we &apos;d better get movin&apos;
&apos;cause it &apos;s all the way on the other side of the park .
i &apos;m fine .
you just try to keep up with us .
i can &apos;t take this .
dad , throw your hands up ! it &apos;s fun !
oh , yeah , it is fun !
reuben , if you heard about that stock at a birthday party ,
it &apos;s already too late .
gloria !
gloria , sit down for a second .
i &apos;m fine , jay .
please ?
look ...
you may not be in pain ...
okay .
but i &apos;m in pain just thinking you &apos;re in pain .
so humor me for one minute .
what are those ?
there wasn &apos;t a big selection at the bibbidi bobbidi boutique .
are you crazy ?
i cannot walk around in public with these ...
things . they &apos;re so yellow and so ugly .
and ... and they &apos;re so softy
and so comfortable .
jay , what is this ?
thank you for going shopping for me .
thank you for worrying about my feet .
thank you for giving me your jacket when i &apos;m cold .
you &apos;re such a good man , jay .
thank you . mmm .
i didn &apos;t expect you to be so ...
so nice .
why are you so surprised ?
now please don &apos;t go all latin on me when i say this .
is it possible
you get angry from time to time
because you &apos;re always wearing ...
uncomfortable shoes ?
maybe .
can you get me a couple of more ?
maybe they have purple ?
whatever you want , honey .
all i &apos;m saying is ,
it seemed like you were pretty into ethan
until dylan showed up .
don &apos;t get me wrong . ethan &apos;s nice , but he &apos;s no dylan .
maybe that &apos;s a good thing ?
why ? because dylan &apos;s a free spirit ?
he &apos;s too edgy for you ?
he plays by his own rules ?
oh , my god .
what ?
i beg of you to turn around
and experience with me the greatest moment of my life .
your rebel boyfriend &apos;s a dapper dan .
maybe that &apos;s not him .
dylan !
uh , uh , sorry .
sorry . um ...
it certainly seems like him .
oh , my god . he looked like
those old pictures of dad from high school .
so anyway , i &apos;ve really been into street art lately .
oh , there &apos;s a really great exhibit downtown . i &apos;ll take you .
oh , on what , your razor scooter ?
mom wants you .
i @-@ i @-@ i ...
ethan ! i &apos;ve been looking all over for you !
i remember i was on pirates of the caribbean ,
and this whole fight with dede was really eating at me .
and there was this angry animatronic wench
with a rolling pin , chasing some poor pirate around .
they were on a track , running in circles ,
so he could never get away from her .
and i remember thinking ,
i can &apos;t save you , buddy ,
but i &apos;m getting off this ride .
... and--and we were going around a corner ,
and i was screaming and i swallowed a bug .
oh , being tail is everything that i dreamed it would be .
what should we do next ?
sit down .
where we gonna sit down ?
the ground . here , this is good right here . oh !
are you okay , dad ?
no , i &apos;m not okay .
i hate to tell you this ,
but these rides are killing me .
b @-@ but you &apos;re the king of roller coasters .
i know !
something happens when you get older .
guess you can &apos;t take it .
one of my favorite things in the world
is doing stupid fun stuff with you ,
like pogo stick basketball
or trying to get a swing to go all the way around .
next time , we should sit on a fire extinguisher .
yes , or a bottle of coke and some mentos .
honestly , though , the way i &apos;m feeling right now ,
i don &apos;t know if there &apos;s gonna be a next time .
dad , we can always find cool stuff to do .
even if you &apos;re old and in a wheelchair ,
i &apos;ll take you to the mall
and push you as fast as you wanna go .
really ?
you &apos;d do that ?
heck , yeah .
and we &apos;ll pop some wheelies , too .
that sounds fun .
and i &apos;ll take you to the top of a huge hill and just let go .
okay , we &apos;ll nail down the specifics later ,
but that ... that &apos;s really nice .
so do you still wanna talk or--
no , go . ride space mountain .
uh , at the end , when they take a picture ,
do something hilarious for both of us .
you &apos;re gonna die .
when you see it , not &apos; cause you &apos;re old .
lily ! lily , stop !
dad ! dad , grab her !
hey , i gotcha , you little monkey !
thank you .
hey , cam , i got her .
we &apos;re in fantasyland . where are you ?
okay , it &apos;s toontown ,
not toonton .
you &apos;ve been watching too much pbs .
thank you .
all right , honey , come here .
i don &apos;t like this thing .
yeah ?
well , i don &apos;t like running like a crazy person
through downton disney--
downtown disney .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
well , the leash is not the answer . you want my help ?
yes , please !
&apos;cause i can fix this for you in about two minutes .
come on , baby girl . come with me .
we &apos;ll be right back .
okay .
where we going ? oh , this way ?
manny , you don &apos;t sound very happy
for a kid that is flying an elephant .
i lost to durkas . it &apos;s not fair .
he wanted to buy ibm because he thought it was funny to say .
well , i &apos;m glad that you lost .
fake money has changed you .
where is the manny that used to stop to smell the roses ?
he took a bath on a solar start @-@ up in san jose .
you have been so busy burying your face in your phone
that you barely said hello to your family ,
you gave winnie the pooh the cold shoulder ,
and you haven &apos;t even noticed
that pretty girl in the blue elephant
that has been smiling at you .
not my type , but still it &apos;s nice to be noticed .
you see what happens
when you &apos;re not burying your head in business ?
you &apos;re right . i &apos;ll try to be more present .
what the heck &apos;s on your feet ?
they &apos;re slippers ! they &apos;re like pillows .
attagirl .
you &apos;re welcome .
look . your dad got her baby high heels ,
which we said we were never gonna let her wear .
i love &apos; em .
you look gorgeous , sweetie .
oh , my gosh . you felt people judged us before ?
wait till they meet little miss anaheim .
who cares ? look at her . she can barely move .
thank you , dad .
you know what ? she &apos;s got pretty good gams for a 3 @-@ year @-@ old .
cheese !
got it . thanks , little john .
thank you !
ooh , they have corn dogs .
we gotta get one before we go back . they are legendary .
i &apos;ll be right back .
okay .
haley !
it &apos;s me . dylan .
i &apos;m in the bear suit . i borrowed it to talk to you .
why are you dancing like that ?
this is what little john does . maybe .
i don &apos;t know what movie this dude is from .
i &apos;m not even supposed to be talking to you .
well , i &apos;m not talking to you .
no , you can talk .
i know , but i &apos;m mad .
you came back to town and didn &apos;t even call me .
i was embarrassed .
i lost my job at the dude ranch ,
and i wanted to get my act together first .
but the four dweebs on a bike act ?
hey , the dapper dans are a main street tradition
since 1959 .
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
i still love her , ethan .
okay , how do you know my name ?
it &apos;s dylan .
look , i don &apos;t wanna harsh your day ,
but i never stopped loving haley and i never will !
i @-@ is this some sort of joke ?
do i look like i &apos;m joking ?
dylan , let &apos;s not do this now .
it has to be now . i &apos;ve got a parade at 3 : 00 .
hey , seriously , dude , back off .
okay , that was my face .
and you &apos;re the one who needs to back off .
you ...
okay . this thing &apos;s kinda heavy .
i can &apos;t get up .
ethan ? ethan , what is going on ? what are you doing ?
uh , hi , mrs. dunphy .
help me up .
no .
if i could get up , i would--uhh !
come on , lily sweetie . keep up , honey .
come on .
phil , you don &apos;t look like you &apos;re doing very well .
maybe because i officially became an old man
back there at thunder mountain .
oh , my goodness . you are burning up .
you might have the flu .
a bunch of guys at work had the flu ,
and we all drink orange juice out of the same carton .
we should get cups .
luke , did you hear that ? ! i have the flu !
glad we didn &apos;t share that pickle .
hey , everybody .
oh , hey , hey , guys . where &apos;s ethan ?
oh , he &apos;s staying . he ran into some friends .
but dylan got fired , so ...
don &apos;t freak out . we have to give him a ride home .
and we &apos;re back together .
hey , no one goes home till we hit the lincoln thing .
yawn .
don &apos;t even try to fight it .
yeah , he made us go when we were kids .
come on , people ! it &apos;s a robotic president !
what &apos;s not to love ?
a robotic president ?
so my plan was , drive claire and mitchell home ,
put them to bed ,
pour myself a big tumbler of scotch ,
and tell dede it was over .
but on the way out , we made one last stop .
if destruction be our lot ,
we are ourselves
must be its author and finisher .
as a nation of free men ,
we must live through all times ...
i don &apos;t know what happened .
maybe it &apos;s what robot lincoln said about a man &apos;s duty
or keeping the union together .
maybe i just chickened out .
but i realized that staying with my kids
was more important than leaving my wife .
now that &apos;s not the right decision for everyone ,
but it was the right decision for me .
and in that faith ,
let us , to the end ,
dare to do our duty
as we understand it .
so i stuck it out until they were grown ...
jay , you want to join me in the jacuzzi ?
and the universe rewarded me .
here we go !
hey , dad , roller coast fist bump .
what was that ?
is this gonna be so awesome !
close your eyes . it make it more fun .
