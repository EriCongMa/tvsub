gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i raided lily &apos;s medicine cabinet .
she sometimes gets headaches .
that &apos;s a hell of a headache .
i think we need a second opinion .
even if you do go with another doctor ,
i &apos;m gonna stick around .
aren &apos;t you blair waldorf ?
we haven &apos;t read about you on
&quot; gossip girl &quot; in forever .
you read &quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
of course . everyone at columbia does .
i called your cell to explain everything .
i even left a message with jenny .
she &apos;s lying . i never talked to her .
just get out .
there &apos;s only one spot for transfer students , and i didn &apos;t get it .
it was me . i got the spot .
why weren &apos;t you honest with me ?
what , like you were honest with me , going behind my back
to apply for the one thing i wanted more than anything ?
the reason i couldn &apos;t talk to you earlier --
it &apos;s not about my dad . it was about my mom .
she &apos;s sick , and i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen .
it &apos;s not working exactly as i &apos;d hoped .
i need you to write lily another prescription .
i doubt the authorities
would be pleased to know what you &apos;ve been doing .
it &apos;s said that we &apos;re all strapped to fortune &apos;s wheel ...
nowhere is this truer than the ever @-@ changing landscape of love .
as one couple enjoys an upswing ...
another is plunged downwards .
but top or bottom , don &apos;t get too comfortable ,
because the one thing you can rely on
is that the wheel will keep on turning .
all right , i &apos;m heading to my mom &apos;s for breakfast .
hey , hey , hey . you &apos;re coming in late and leaving early all week .
i &apos;m starting to feel cheap .
oh , i &apos;m sorry i haven &apos;t been around much lately .
just with everything going so well with my dad--
hey , serena , no worries .
okay ?
look , i love being your crash pad ,
but , you know , maybe you &apos;d feel better if you moved back in
with your mom while she &apos;s getting her treatment .
and have to see jenny &apos;s lying face first thing in the morning ?
no , thank you .
that is not the same girl chuck came home with last night .
has he , uh , come to talk to lily yet ?
do you want me to talk to him ?
no , i already tried , but thank you .
i &apos;m gonna come to your lacrosse game after brunch .
judge away . shame turns me on .
hey , man , she &apos;s going to lily &apos;s for brunch .
maybe a stack of waffles will help your hangover ?
i find the cause is the best cure .
i gotta go . so i will see you later at the library ,
and i &apos;m sorry about before
with the tisch catalog .
it &apos;s fine .
dan , i don &apos;t know how to do this .
we &apos;ve been tiptoeing around each other for days .
look , we &apos;re -- we &apos;re two artists in a relationship ,
and sometimes we &apos;re gonna be competing for the same things ,
so , all right , we &apos;re-- we &apos;re--we &apos;re smart people .
let &apos;s come up with ... some rules ,
a list of topics that are off @-@ limits .
isn &apos;t that what got us in trouble with tisch ?
no , no . this will be different ,
because we &apos;ll know ... what we don &apos;t know .
hey , listen to me . i &apos;m quoting donald rumsfeld .
okay , until the sting of tisch has worn off ,
i @-@ i don &apos;t think we should talk about classes .
like , if--if you &apos;re taking playwriting with sam shepard ,
it may hurt my heart ,
but if you take intro to mime ,
i need to know everything .
i want to be with you when you buy your leotard and your beret .
playwriting competitions--
i think we can go out for the same ones ,
but we can &apos;t read each other &apos;s submissions .
and looking forward , i guess it &apos;s the same thing
with internships and jobs .
so the only things we can talk about openly
are--are politics ,
&quot; jersey shore ... &quot;
and where we want to eat ... which reminds me , i actually ,
um , i need to get ready .
i &apos;m gonna be late for breakfast at my dad &apos;s .
are you sure you don &apos;t want to come ?
no , i &apos;m sorry . i , uh , i have something .
oh , oh , is it something related to our list ?
actually , yeah .
well , thank you for not sharing .
see ? i can &apos;t believe how much easier that is .
ooh ! another sext session with your new b.f. ?
okay , i &apos;d hardly call elliot a boyfriend .
between me spending all my time with my mom
and him being in every club in school ,
we haven &apos;t even been on a first date .
hey . still using cooking as therapy ?
yeah .
ooh . excuse me .
sorry .
good morning , everyone . oh , look at all of this food .
it &apos;s obscene .
you okay ? how are you feeling ?
can i get you something ?
please , everyone , relax . what i need is
tor the people who love me to treat me like they always do .
has anybody heard from chuck ?
yeah , uh , he &apos;s--he &apos;s sorry he couldn &apos;t make it .
charles has the right idea .
if he were here , then i &apos;d really worry .
anyway , one thing i &apos;ll say about william &apos;s treatment ...
is that i have not lost my appetite . i want waffles .
music to my ears .
dad .
what &apos;s he doing here ?
i invited him .
looks great , lily . really great .
so i hope you &apos;ll all join me
for this doctors without borders gala tomorrow at columbia .
i must admit , i feel a bit silly about the whole thing .
clearly , columbia &apos;s run out of alumni to honor ,
if the best they could come up with is ... me .
false humility--check .
i &apos;ll be there .
i hope you don &apos;t mind . i invited nate and blair .
i really want them to get to know you .
terrific . i &apos;d be honored .
well , rufus and i would love to come .
why don &apos;t you grab a plate ? help yourself .
what ? he left when i was 2 .
the man &apos;s a total stranger to me .
you have to at least give him a chance .
no , i don &apos;t .
okay , everyone .
let &apos;s sit down and enjoy this wonderful food .
dad , here . sit here . rufus , scoot over , please .
please .
thank you .
blair , what &apos;s up ?
i thought i &apos;d come and watch your lacrosse game .
so if you could make sure that there &apos;s a seat for me in v.i.p. ,
preferably next to an injured cute player ,
but not one on scholarship .
since when do you care about lacrosse ?
since i desperately needed to get away from n.y.u.
everyone &apos;s planning their living arrangements for next year .
it &apos;s so depressing .
i thought your friends asked you to live with them .
in a postwar building
on a street that &apos;s not even numbered . it &apos;s lettered .
and its big selling point is that it &apos;s above a falafel stand .
all right , listen , i gotta go .
there &apos;s no v.i.p. area ,
but there &apos;s a nice set of bleachers .
blair ? you probably don &apos;t remember us ,
but we met you at your mom &apos;s fashion show .
yeah , of course .
hair band girl . i never forget a good accessory .
we &apos;re celebrating .
we just got the most amazing apartment ever .
you would totally approve-- prewar , doorman ,
and the best part--fauchon is supposedly opening up next door .
can i ask you something ?
what do you think about falafel ?
ew . isn &apos;t that the kind of food paralegals eat ?
i never thought i &apos;d see blair waldorf
on the upper west side .
unless ... oh , my god .
are you transferring to columbia ? i hope so .
n.y.u. is so beneath you .
i @-@ it &apos;s true !
i &apos;m a columbia girl now .
as you should be .
yay !
you know , the last time i was invited
to a ceremony in my honor , i had to slaughter a chicken .
well , at least you &apos;ve been honored .
i &apos;ve--i &apos;ve never been honored ,
i did win a contest once at boarding school ,
and i think there was a plaque ,
but i &apos;m not sure that really counts .
what kind of contest ?
it was for drinking hot chocolate at the winter fair .
i had a buddy that went to exeter ,
and the stories he tells would make keith richards blush .
yeah , i wasn &apos;t really into the party scene .
i was there more for the academics .
it sounds like you &apos;ve made some great choices , serena .
i &apos;m glad . the bad ones have a way of ... following you .
you know , i &apos;ve never heard that hot chocolate story .
yeah , well , there are a lot of stories you haven &apos;t heard .
true , but i did hear this one .
my ex @-@ boyfriend went to boarding school with serena ,
and he tells a great one about her and this teacher one night
at a bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast--
jenny .
although i &apos;m sure they were just studying .
you know , like she says , she was all about the academics .
i have an announcement , everyone .
i &apos;ve decided i &apos;m moving back in .
that way , i can be here with you , mom .
and it &apos;ll just be really great to be back in my old room again .
don &apos;t worry , jenny . we &apos;ll-- we &apos;ll find a place for you .
well , that &apos;s great ,
because i &apos;m moving in , too .
downstairs . i was waiting to tell you
until the board approved my sublet tomorrow .
but i &apos;m very excited .
all my family together under one roof again .
better watch out , humphreys .
they say love makes a family , but on the upper east side ,
everyone knows it &apos;s real estate .
hey , dad , i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m running so late .
can you save me a waffle ?
always .
i &apos;ll put one in the oven for you .
how &apos;s lily ?
she &apos;s great .
and you ? how you holding up ? i mean , it must be weird .
lily &apos;s ex @-@ husband is now her doctor .
it was at first . but the fact is ,
he &apos;s just her doctor now . i &apos;m her husband .
by the way , vanessa can &apos;t make it .
said she had to be somewhere .
oh , right . the , internship at cnn .
they called me as one of the references she listed .
ah . yeah , i @-@ i wouldn &apos;t know . she and i are
keeping our creative lives separate right now .
you might wanna discuss this one ,
since it involves her going to haiti for three months .
you know what , dad ?
i think i &apos;m gonna have to cancel that waffle .
okay .
all right . see you .
i know this gala tomorrow night seems boring ,
but i thought , if there &apos;s a girl you like ,
perhaps you &apos;d like to invite her .
actually , i &apos;m gay .
so if i was going , which i &apos;m not ,
then my date would be a guy named elliot .
that &apos;s cool .
bring elliot . i &apos;d love to meet him--
please stop acting like
you and i have any kind of relationship .
you &apos;re right .
i have a lot to make up for .
i &apos;m sorry .
the window for that closed somewhere
between my 12th birthday and ,
my suicide attempt .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m fine now .
going through all that without a father made me realize
that i don &apos;t need one .
i understand that i &apos;ve lost the right
to be a father to you , but ...
if there &apos;s any way that we can get to know each other ...
on your terms ...
serena may want a relationship with you ,
but i don &apos;t .
serena , stop it ! you can &apos;t do that .
the room was on loan , and i &apos;m taking it back .
and i don &apos;t care if i did leave it in the closet .
borrowing without asking is stealing ,
jenny .
dad , tell her to stop !
serena , please . i think it &apos;s great
that you &apos;re moving back in , but this is jenny &apos;s room now .
all her things are here . you can stay in chuck &apos;s old room .
no way . that room is haunted by chuck &apos;s depravity .
jenny can take it . i &apos;m sure it wouldn &apos;t bother you .
okay , what--what &apos;s going on with you two ?
nothing .
fine . whatever . serena can have her old room back .
all right , that &apos;s ridiculous .
serena , i &apos;ll have laryssa make up chuck &apos;s bed for you .
i &apos;m confident that there &apos;s no depravity
that brand @-@ new e. braun sheets can &apos;t erase .
how many problems does jenny have to cause
before you realize she &apos;s the problem ?
hey . thanks for meeting me here .
the library started ...
did you
apply for a documentary internship in haiti ?
yeah .
the producer just called . i ... i got the job .
when were you planning on telling me about this ?
this morning ,
and then you put internships on the &quot; do not discuss &quot; list ,
and i panicked .
why ? why ?
this is not about competing for something .
this is ... this is about our relationship .
but both of those have been so tied up in each other ,
and this job is a huge deal for me , dan .
but you can &apos;t pretend like you going away for three months
is not gonna affect us .
i think i didn &apos;t wanna face that .
it was just so much easier when we were just friends
and we could talk about things .
all right , is ... is that what you want , then ?
you wanna go back to just friends ?
i don &apos;t know .
anyway ,
uh , serena might be a little upset .
well , you were right . she can stay in charles &apos; room .
it &apos;s getting crowded around here .
no kidding . throw in your ex @-@ husband ,
and now we &apos;re a nancy meyers movie .
i hope you don &apos;t mind . i know it &apos;s awkward .
well , i mean , it is a little unusual , don &apos;t you think ,
for a doctor to move in to his patient &apos;s building ?
well , not if he &apos;s the father of the patient &apos;s children .
what are you getting at ?
is it possible that ...
will &apos;s also trying to get close to you ?
absolutely not .
i &apos;m the one that told william to stay away
if he couldn &apos;t make good
on the promises he made to the children .
and i &apos;m sorry if this is uncomfortable for you .
but if william wants to move in to be closer to the kids ,
i &apos;m not gonna stand in his way .
holland ? hi , it &apos;s rufus .
i have a favor to ask .
... and the social scene at n.y.u. was criminal .
ten freshmen , a keg
and a tub of hummus on a card table isn &apos;t a party .
it &apos;s a tragedy .
blair waldorf just got a text .
it &apos;s like watching lady gaga set fire to a piano !
who &apos;s it from ?
serena .
apparently , jenny humphrey is claiming squatter &apos;s rights
on her old room . it &apos;s disgusting .
oh , my god .
jenny can &apos;t do that to serena van der woodsen .
so what &apos;s the plan of attack ?
it &apos;s between serena and jenny .
anyway , i &apos;ve had some recent bad luck
getting involved in real estate disputes .
so i was thinking warren @-@ tricomi mani / pedis ?
i told you . it doesn &apos;t matter if she transfers .
blair waldorf was over
the minute she became a student at n.y.u.
are you third personing me ?
i third person people , not you !
exactly .
you &apos;re blair waldorf ... fashion icon , queen b.
and probably the future president of the united states .
or chanel .
jenny humphrey just kicked serena van der woodsen
out of her room , and you &apos;re not gonna do anything ?
i would . i just don &apos;t have any dirt on jenny right now .
ahem . i do .
jenny and her boyfriend sold my boyfriend adderall
a couple of months ago . lose the judge @-@ face , zoe .
he took a very heavy course load this semester .
jenny humphrey , drug dealer .
i can work with that .
we hear blair waldorf &apos;s headed for a comeback .
but if she wants to keep her fans happy ...
send .
she better keep serving up the hits .
sleep well ?
don &apos;t even , serena .
i can &apos;t believe you posted on &quot; gossip girl &quot;
that i &apos;m a drug dealer .
i didn &apos;t post anything .
fine . maybe you didn &apos;t send the actual e @-@ mail ,
but everyone knows you have blair do your dirty work .
i can &apos;t help what blair does .
and you are the one who played pablo escobar
to underage preppy pill poppers .
my dad and i were finally in a good place
after a really , really bad patch .
and if he finds this out ,
it &apos;ll destroy everything .
well , maybe rufus should know
that his daughter is dealing drugs .
after all , you thought my father should know
all my adventures at boarding school .
fine . maybe i shouldn &apos;t have said anything ,
but maybe you shouldn &apos;t be lying to your dad .
are you really lecturing me
about lying to a parent ?
my dad knows who i am ,
but you &apos;re building a relationship with yours
that &apos;s a complete lie .
i can &apos;t believe that you are willing to destroy
my relationship with my father because you &apos;re too scared
that yours won &apos;t love you for who you really are .
you were right . we need to make these decisions together .
but the truth is , consulting with someone else
doesn &apos;t come easily to me .
i get it .
vanessa , i totally support you going .
thank you , but i &apos;m not taking the internship .
i &apos;d rather lose the job than lose you .
you &apos;re not gonna lose me if you go to haiti .
we &apos;re ... we &apos;re ... we &apos;re gonna find a way to make this work .
all right ? but you gotta go .
i don &apos;t want to , and we both know
it &apos;s better for our relationship if i stayed .
i mean , three months is too long , and ...
i just wanna be with you .
are you sure ?
you &apos;re ... you &apos;re making this decision for you ?
not me ? not ... not ... not even us ?
uh ... okay .
let &apos;s find a way to celebrate tonight , then ... a fun way .
we could , uh ... let &apos;s see . you want to sneak 40s
into the midnight showing of &quot; the lost weekend &quot;
at film forum ? yeah . - actually , i &apos;m supposed to have drinks
with the woman from cnn , and i owe it to her
to tell her my decision face to face .
okay . all right . well , uh , tomorrow night , then .
absolutely .
blair . hey .
you never made it to my lacrosse game yesterday .
what are you doing ?
i could ask you the same question .
does serena know you &apos;re trying to pull off plaid ?
seriously , blair , i expected chuck
to go back to his old habits after your breakup ,
but i &apos;d actually thought
you &apos;d grown up a little .
whatever do you mean ?
blair waldorf on the upper west side
two days in a row ? it pretty much looks like
you &apos;re pretending to be a columbia student ,
and not that i care much about what jenny humphrey does these days ,
but i saw that smackdown on &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
she was dealing drugs . it &apos;s called an intervention .
it &apos;s called you going back to plotting and conniving ,
okay , and that &apos;s the waldorf equivalent
of chuck going around ,
sleeping with every call girl in the city
and avoiding any kind of emotional contact .
okay . so i &apos;m pretending to be a student here .
but it &apos;s only because i &apos;m living a nightmare .
i &apos;m trapped at n.y.u. ,
and-- and it &apos;s too late to transfer .
so what &apos;s wrong with cheering myself up with a little denial
and a &quot; gossip girl &quot; blast or two ?
nothing , i guess , but you can always make it right
with whoever you take down online .
and who knows if chuck &apos;s even gonna have time
to do that with lily or not ?
morning , sunshine .
i &apos;ve got the dom &apos; 95 , your favorite .
no , thank you .
and i much prefer roederer nowadays .
oh , i apologize . nadine left behind some of her intimates .
she must have wanted an excuse to come back .
or maybe she just left in a hurry .
if you &apos;re here to mock me , i &apos;m not in the mood ...
unless you have some punishment in mind .
we &apos;ve broken up , chuck ,
and frankly , i don &apos;t care what you do .
but i can &apos;t sit by and just watch you avoid lily .
i &apos;m actually quite busy with work .
well , you had time for nadine .
trust me , she was work .
and i promise you , lily is not sitting around ,
wondering when she &apos;s going to hear from chuck bass .
justify not seeing lily all you want .
you and i both know what this is .
you &apos;ve lost bart ,
elizabeth betrayed you ,
and the thought of losing lily terrifies you .
please .
spare me your n.y.u. freshman psych analysis .
perhaps if you were at an ivy ,
you &apos;d have better insight .
spotted -- b. claiming to be a co @-@ ed at columbia ,
when everyone knows she &apos;s a zero at n.y.u.
poor b.
first she lost chuck and now her dignity .
&quot; gossip girl &quot; blast ?
no , it &apos;s nothing .
look , chuck ,
sleep with every nadine in town for all i care ,
but don &apos;t close your heart to lily .
you and i both know that in the end ,
the person you &apos;ll end up hurting the most is you .
amalia , it &apos;s blair .
are you still waiting on me to sign the lease ?
well , tell the girls it &apos;s a yes .
i &apos;ll take the apartment .
you make your bed , you lie in it , b.
too bad yours is in the east village .
hey . were you able to convince your brother to come tonight ?
no . and please don &apos;t act like you care .
i &apos;m sorry ?
i just got off the phone with my dad .
apparently , someone didn &apos;t want him living in the building ,
so they gave him a bad recommendation , and it worked .
the board didn &apos;t approve him .
you &apos;re behind this , right ?
i am .
how could you do that ?
i don &apos;t expect you to understand , serena ,
but i felt like it was the right thing to do .
look , i know you and my father used to hate each other ,
but that was a long time ago .
you are the only one still having this fight .
he has moved on .
is everything okay ?
rufus went to the board and blocked dad from getting the apartment .
serena , that &apos;s absurd .
rufus would never do something like that .
i would , to protect my marriage .
i don &apos;t trust william &apos;s intention ,
and i don &apos;t want him living under my roof .
rufus , you &apos;re being completely paranoid .
at first he tried he tried to isolate you from your family ,
and now he &apos;s moving into the building to get closer to you .
i told you , he &apos;s moving in to be close to the children .
all i see here is jealousy run amok .
mom , come on . we should go .
lil--
rufus , it &apos;s probably best if you don &apos;t come tonight .
what are you two doing here ?
this is an alumni event .
columbia puts aside a bunch of tickets for students .
we &apos;d invite you to join , but they were very explicit--
no fake students allowed .
if you &apos;ll excuse me a moment ,
i should go say hello to a few old colleagues .
i &apos;ll be right back .
don &apos;t rush .
do i want to know what you had to promise him to get him to come ?
no , it wasn &apos;t me .
it &apos;s not like he even listens to me ,
and he probably just ran out of girls to have sex with .
i , uh , want to apologize .
my absence has been inexcusable .
well , i know my situation brings up a lot of issues for you .
you &apos;ve had to deal with so much loss .
but i &apos;m not gonna lose you .
i &apos;m here for you ,
every step of the way .
you , uh , you look good , lily .
in fact , you look better than good . you look great .
thank you . i feel great .
so you had better be prepared
for a lifetime of family brunches ,
because i &apos;m not going anywhere .
i bailed on the columbia gala .
i was kind of in the mood
for watching a pretentious movie i don &apos;t understand with you and vanessa .
no vanessa , but pretentious movie ? check .
look , not that i &apos;m not thrilled to expose you
to the joys of russian cinema , but does this visit of yours
have anything to do with the &quot; gossip girl &quot; blast ?
is it true ?
are you dealing ?
i was ,
when i was dating damien , yeah .
but , no , not anymore .
this could so easily get back to dad .
i @-@ i think it &apos;d be better if he heard it from you .
are you insane ?
i @-@ i mean , you and i both know that &apos;s a suicide mission .
if you want him to have faith in you , jenny ,
maybe you need to have a little faith in him .
yeah , all right .
i &apos;ll go see if i can dig out a dress from my old closet .
maybe i can catch him at the gala--you know ,
big crowd , lots of witnesses .
oh . uh , is everything okay with you and vanessa ?
yeah . yeah , well , at least i think it is .
it &apos;s been hard to say lately .
maybe you need to have a little faith , too .
it &apos;s great to see you again .
you , too .
what a pleasure .
good to see you .
good to see you , bob .
dad , um , do you have a second ?
i want to talk to you about something .
sure . please sit .
you know , the contest that i won at boarding school ...
it was for drinking ... absinthe ,
and that was probably one of my--my tamer nights .
the truth is i @-@ i &apos;ve had a pretty wild past ,
and i &apos;ve been a part of more than one scandal .
serena , i don &apos;t care about any of that .
i know . i guess i was just ...
scared that ... once mom gets better ,
you ... you may not wanna stick around
if you knew the real me .
honey , i want nothing more
than to be a part of all of your lives again .
i &apos;m trying to figure out how big a role i can play
without stepping on anybody &apos;s toes .
yeah .
you know , i love rufus ...
but you &apos;re my dad .
he &apos;s not .
aw , serena finally has
the perfect relationship with her daddy .
but will her dream come true be rufus &apos; worst nightmare ?
here we are .
thank you .
oh , of course .
the theme of this evening seems to be torture .
you &apos;re not a fan of , uh , university galas ?
quite the opposite . i &apos;m in my natural habitat .
it &apos;s torture because it &apos;s at columbia .
and by some cruel twist of fate , i go to n.y.u.
it &apos;s like being locked out of lanvin
on the day they get fall in .
sorry , i don &apos;t mean to ramble on .
i &apos;m blair waldorf .
wait . i know that name .
you read &quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
no , i read college applications .
i work in the admissions office at columbia .
i was just looking at your application today .
i &apos;m sorry ?
look , it &apos;s , um , it &apos;s not our policy to do this ,
but e @-@ mails go out tomorrow , and you &apos;re standing right here ,
so welcome to columbia , blair waldorf .
champagne , please .
whoa . are you okay ? you got crazy eyes .
i think i just became a columbia student ... for real .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense . i @-@ i never applied .
oh , my god .
i cannot believe he actually did it .
months ago , chuck joked about applying for you .
he said you had too much pride to admit n.y.u. was a mistake .
looks like he actually did something right for once .
congratulations .
oh , thanks .
you &apos;re not at the gala ?
yeah . i thought it &apos;d be best for everybody if i didn &apos;t go .
i see my father is still working his magic .
it &apos;s not all him .
yes , it is . it &apos;s just that no one else sees it .
you make my mom happier than all of her ex @-@ husbands combined .
it should be you with her tonight ,
not some guy who pulled a disappearing act .
well , i am already in the tux .
elliot , what are you doing here ?
your father invited me ?
he said he didn &apos;t think you had plans tonight .
not me .
i hope that &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay to be mad at him , eric ,
but it &apos;s okay to let him try to make it right , too .
all right . i &apos;m heading out . wish me luck .
you don &apos;t need it . you &apos;re the only one for her .
after dr. van der woodsen organized
the response to the polio outbreak in india ,
he moved on to somalia ,
where he served as a field coordinator in huddur .
while there , he oversaw everything
from shrapnel wounds to cancer to chronic illness .
rufus . i &apos;m surprised to see you here , of all places .
holland , if you &apos;ll excuse me .
i &apos;ll catch up with you later . i need to talk to lily .
rufus , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m sorry about today . i don &apos;t want will to come between us .
i don &apos;t give a damn who lives where .
i just want to be with you .
... improving access to primary health care
to remote villages .
he has done all of this
while continuing to build his reputation
as a leader in the progressive treatments of cancer .
lily looks amazing , doesn &apos;t she ?
i mean , being sick hasn &apos;t slowed her down at all .
yeah , she is the picture of health .
... invaluable member of our team .
ladies and gentlemen ,
dr. william van der woodsen .
thank you . thank you , dean . thank you .
i had another speech prepared for you this evening ,
but then my beautiful daughter serena came to me ,
and she was so honest and brave ,
that it made me realize that , uh ,
i need to be honest , too .
i made many personal sacrifices to be a doctor ,
but i never quite realized until now that ...
the greatest sacrifice of all
was my family .
so the most important thing that i can say here tonight
is not to all of you ,
but , uh , to them .
i made the biggest mistake of my life walking out on you ,
and i promise to do everything in my power
to make it up to you , to make it right again ,
because i love you .
my , oh , my .
did dr. van der woodsen
just make a public pass at rufus &apos; wife ?
looks like this doctor without borders needs a few boundaries .
well , i guess you were right about william ,
but it doesn &apos;t matter how he feels about me ,
because i don &apos;t love him . i love you , rufus .
i know you &apos;re comfortable with him , lil ,
but i &apos;m not .
i need you to find another doctor .
look , i understand why you don &apos;t trust him ,
but surely , you trust me .
look , i don &apos;t want to fight with you , rufus .
okay , we &apos;ll put it aside till tomorrow .
let &apos;s get you home .
you know what ?
right now , more than anything ,
i just need a quiet night , alone .
lily .
please , just for tonight ,
i need you to sleep at the loft .
lily .
jenny humphrey .
uh , yeah ?
you bitch . you told me you were selling me oxy ,
but those pills were antibiotics .
yeah , i didn &apos;t get high . i got a yeast infection .
dad . look , i can explain .
i came here to tell you .
jenny , please save your breath .
like i &apos;m gonna believe a word out of your mouth .
get your things and come with me .
we &apos;re going home ... to brooklyn .
what did you want to talk about that couldn &apos;t wait ?
the producer from cnn just flew into town ,
and i &apos;m gonna meet her for drinks in 20 minutes .
i want you to take the internship .
come on , dan .
i don &apos;t want us
to be making decisions based on fear . all right ?
so whatever happens , we &apos;ll figure it out .
thank you .
i , uh ...
got you some stationery ,
so we can write some handwritten letters to each other
while you &apos;re away .
that is so romantic .
maybe if we become famous writers one day ,
they &apos;ll publish &apos; em after we die ,
like sartre and de beauvoir .
maybe , but don &apos;t let that stop you
from writing some of the dirty stuff . just a little bit .
i &apos;m gonna miss you so much .
not , uh , not if you don &apos;t go . you &apos;re gonna be late .
you don &apos;t want to be late to meet your new boss .
get out of here .
thank you .
oh , hey , holland .
hey . have you seen your mother ?
no . i think she left .
oh .
is everything okay ?
if dr. van der woodsen loves your mother
as much as he said he did in that speech ,
then maybe there &apos;s something
she should know about rufus .
listen carefully , s.
holland has a tale to tell .
apparently , her upstairs neighbor
has been coming downstairs .
good night .
good night .
take care . good to see you .
good to see you . bye .
dad !
serena , i thought you left .
is everything okay ?
not really , no .
i heard what you said in your speech ,
and if you want to fight for mom , then you should do it .
hi .
i think you girls got some misinformation .
i will be attending columbia in the fall .
oh . well , that &apos;s awesome .
we have an extra room in the apartment .
maybe you wanna move in with us ?
no . i don &apos;t live with the help .
oh , and you wanted to see
a blair waldorf takedown ?
well , cross me again ,
and you &apos;ll experience one firsthand .
hello ?
hey , it &apos;s jenny .
i want to talk to you about lily .
obviously , i &apos;m not a doctor ,
and it &apos;s kind of a long story how i know this ,
but there &apos;s something weird about her medicine .
elliot &apos;s the perfect mix of smart and fun .
he speaks three languages ,
but he has a subscription to &quot; people &quot; magazine .
hey . i invited dad over for some hot chocolate .
i @-@ i hope that &apos;s okay .
if it &apos;s a bad idea , i can--
no , it &apos;s okay .
william , join us .
hey , rufus .
it &apos;s serena .
hi . is your mom there ?
um ...
yeah , she--she &apos;s here .
she &apos;s just really tired right now .
i &apos;ll let her know you called .
they say that family are
the people who will always take you in .
but what if instead , they shut the door ?
i was just telling mom about my date with elliot .
we had a great time . thank you .
oh , who was that ?
oh , it was just blair .
or even worse ,
let someone else take your place ?
what do you say , serena ? who &apos;s your daddy ?
