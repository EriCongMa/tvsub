oh , my god , no !
emily .
i said , this is our last session .
it doesn &apos;t have to be good @-@ bye .
my door is always open .
thank you .
but , um , i--i feel good .
you know ? ready .
how are your nails ?
3 days , no biting .
are you sleeping ?
i am . uh , it &apos;s been
two weeks , i think , since the last dream .
they may not have gone away completely .
correct me if i &apos;m wrong .
you never had a chance to mourn your own death , did you ?
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t understand the question .
as part of protecting your identity , your team had to bury you .
they lost someone they loved .
maybe you did , too .
think about it .
i will .
so houston p.d. needs our
boots on the ground for the piano man case .
serial rapist ?
a case we consulted on about 8 months ago .
12 victims over 5 years .
he crosses racial and social lines , ages , too .
power assertive ?
knocks them out with a date rape drug
and binds them with piano wire .
they wake up with no memory of the assault
or how they got the permanent scar the wire leaves .
so he &apos;s branding his victims . how does he dose them ?
houston p.d. still isn &apos;t sure ,
&apos;cause , you know , date rape drugs metabolize quickly ,
and he &apos;s keeping them for 12 hours .
so why are they calling us in now ?
because of these most recent attacks .
this piece of work has elevated sick and twisted
to a whole new dimension . cases in point--
brittany anderson filed a report after she woke up
outside the restaurant she was abducted from ,
and vanessa campbell was just reported missing .
wait , those were victims 2 and 5 , weren &apos;t they ?
yes . he &apos;s going back and attacking survivors a second time .
vanessa was grabbed from her house ?
he &apos;s changing him m.o. from what we studied .
he &apos;s upping his game .
well , we know he stalks them .
but public venue abduction , he has the power .
home invasion , he &apos;s on their turf .
so he &apos;s betting he can gain control
before they get to a phone or a gun .
the question is why . what is he getting
from revisiting old victims ?
it seems careless for someone who &apos;s been so controlled up to now .
what is this on the floor ?
uh , that--oh , god-- that is
the contents of vanessa campbell &apos;s stomach ,
which she ralphed up .
and in the glass ?
according to the police report ,
it is salt and water .
homemade emetic .
e @-@ what what ?
quick and dirty cocktail , meant to induce vomiting .
vanessa campbell and her husband moved to a new address .
they &apos;ve put locks on the doors .
they took precautions . she even knew what to do
if she was dosed again , and it still wasn &apos;t enough .
that &apos;s what he gets out of it .
their fear . he wants them to know that no matter what ,
he can still get to them .
&quot; we do not suffer from the shock of our trauma ,
but we make out of it just what suits our purposes . &quot;
alfred adler .
i &apos;m sorry . i thought you said 10 : 30 .
i did . for you . have a seat .
i received dr. merill &apos;s evaluation .
i just wanted to review it with you .
here ?
i get tired of being profiled
through my office window .
well , what is there to discuss ?
she gave me a clean bill of health .
&quot; patient shows no hesitation tackling difficult goals
&quot; as part of reintegrating into her life .
she has reached out to her mother . &quot;
i &apos;m going to .
and has started a romantic relationship with a man named sergio .
now , i don &apos;t care if you lie to your therapist .
all i care about is how your behavior affects your job .
i don &apos;t think it has .
you &apos;ve been overcompensating .
how have i ...
you rushed to repair your relationship with morgan .
you &apos;ve become an emotional sounding board for reid and rossi .
that &apos;s being a good friend .
you offered me parenting advice .
ok , so maybe i have been working a little bit harder
to regain people &apos;s trust . is that such a bad thing ?
no .
it only is if you use it
to avoid dealing with what you went through .
but i &apos;m not .
i chose to come back here .
why ? because i care about the people i work with ?
yes . but also because it &apos;s clean .
i know who the good guys and the bad guys are .
i don &apos;t have to worry about screwing someone over
to make a case .
ok . i want you to make a deal with me .
you &apos;re gonna go weeks , months even , feeling fine .
and then you &apos;re gonna have a bad day .
just let me know when you do .
and that &apos;s it ?
that &apos;s it .
deal .
sergio ?
he is the perfect man .
he doesn &apos;t hog the covers , and he poops in a box .
i just got the breakdown of vanessa campbell &apos;s vomit ,
and there &apos;s no trace of rohypnol of ghb .
date rape drugs are fast , but not that fast .
however he &apos;s dosing them , it &apos;s not through their stomachs .
chief , have you been able to contact all the victims ?
the ones that we could find .
some moved . and some wouldn &apos;t take our call .
but then the press got ahold of it ,
and the women started to contact us .
3 more victims admitted they &apos;d been re @-@ assaulted .
80 % of women who are raped never report it .
understandable they didn &apos;t want to report it a second time .
still no dna .
but what we do have is a partial fingerprint
from victim number one &apos;s glasses , regina lampert .
but we can &apos;t match it to the second assaults
because the forensic evidence has been destroyed
due to delayed disclosure .
that &apos;s how he &apos;s getting away with it .
he &apos;s banking on their silence .
so , then what did you do after the attack ?
i changed everything about myself .
my hair color , my clothes , my apartment .
i took self @-@ defense classes .
i &apos;m an orange belt .
and i carry pepper spray and a whistle .
and that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t call the police .
who &apos;s gonna buy that this happened to me twice ?
we do .
yeah , &apos; cause you &apos;re nice .
nobody believes a slut who cries wolf .
we want to go back to the second attack .
it sounds like you were
trying to restore some normalcy to your life .
my husband told me that i was at the mall .
i don &apos;t remember much .
i completely blacked out .
both times . just ...
gone .
diane .
are we almost done ?
or can we at least take a smoke break ?
i &apos;m dying here .
you can &apos;t smoke in here , but there &apos;s an area outside .
thank god .
do you guys have a light ?
did you start smoking before the assaults or after ?
before . why ?
yes , vanessa smokes .
what does it matter ?
it might explain how the unsub is drugging these women .
the media has done a very good job of warning people
to watch their drinks so that
bars are no longer a fertile hunting ground ,
but cigarette smokers aren &apos;t as careful .
they might ask to have a cigarette from a stranger
or have their pack swapped
out of their purse when they put it down
and then unknowingly inhale pcp or scopolamine ,
both of which mimic the effects of date rape drugs .
she hid them in her purse .
she didn &apos;t think i knew .
she cracked the windows so i wouldn &apos;t smell it when i got home .
if the unsub stalked her from the backyard ,
he &apos;d have a good view when she lit up .
he also took out the window with something like a center punch .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a spring @-@ loaded device used to punch divots into metal .
it also breaks glass .
no cigarettes . he must have taken them with him
to hide the evidence .
you know , it might not be all he &apos;s trying to hide .
mr. campbell , was this on when you came home ?
the police told me not to touch anything .
you sure got a lot of mp @-@ 3s on here .
was it playing one of them ?
no . why ?
well , the media center keeps a history
of the last 20 songs played ,
but it looks like somebody erased it .
it wasn &apos;t me .
ok , i can &apos;t tell you who deleted that playback list ,
but i can tell you exactly when the log was cleared .
7 : 43 p.m.
why erase a history of someone else &apos;s music ?
because he didn &apos;t erase someone else &apos;s music .
at 7 : 36 he loaded an mp @-@ 3 via usb drive ,
played it , and promptly deleted it .
cleared the history so he could cover up his tracks .
the unsub brought his own music to an abduction ?
yes , he did ,
and that is creepy .
fortunately , whatever is imported onto this computer
is downloaded to the home network ,
so , ladies and gentlemen , the mystery song of mr. gruesome is ...
that &apos;s specific .
that &apos;s another reason to call him the piano man .
turn it off .
please .
does this song mean something to you or your wife ?
vanessa hates it .
how come ?
i don &apos;t know .
she doesn &apos;t know .
but every time it came on the radio , she &apos;d burst into tears .
so the unsub just happened
to play it the night he came after her .
can i play ?
hey , you got table 4 ready for me ?
great .
12 is generous .
looks like somebody &apos;s making a car payment .
not tonight , ok ?
oh , come on . who doesn &apos;t love this song ?
me .
i don &apos;t .
ok .
sorry .
songs ?
i know it &apos;s kind of a strange question ,
but are there any that trigger an emotional outburst ?
a song that didn &apos;t bother you before the assault .
&quot; maybe i &apos;m amazed . &quot;
i used to love that song .
ok , great . good . we done ?
not quite . um ,
your comment about the slut who cries wolf .
it made us wonder if there
was something else you wanted to tell us .
did you lose consciousness ?
i blacked out . i--
diana , you &apos;re safe here . whatever it is--
i just don &apos;t remember anything .
&quot; lady in red , &quot; &quot; up where we belong , &quot; &quot; glory of love . &quot;
each victim has her own piano ballad .
you know , considering the
survivors lose consciousness during the rape ,
we think this functions as the unsub &apos;s signature .
he most likely plays the songs repeatedly during the assault ,
resulting in a pavlovian response
when they hear it later , sort of a subconscious rape trigger .
the night of vanessa campbell &apos;s abduction ,
that signature became part of his torture .
why these songs ? what do they say about him ?
go ahead , morgan ?
we just found vanessa campbell &apos;s body .
he didn &apos;t even bother hiding it .
how long has she been dead ?
maybe 5 hours .
he &apos;s never killed before . are we sure it &apos;s our unsub ?
he used a piano wire as a garrote .
i &apos;m not seeing my keys .
i can &apos;t find anything in this bag .
normally the waitress has to pour me into a cab ,
not the other way around .
oh , really ?
well , this is me .
i &apos;m , um , i &apos;m the suv . i &apos;m sorry .
listen , i know we just met .
i can &apos;t , uh , i can &apos;t let you drive like this .
ah ... drive ? i &apos;m sleeping in this bitch .
don &apos;t be silly .
uh , lock your doors .
a lot of--a lot of creeps out there . ok ?
ok .
well ... good night .
good night .
you have a cigarette ?
yes , i do .
just , uh , don &apos;t tell my wife .
i promised her i &apos;d quit .
ok . yeah .
it &apos;ll be our little secret .
ok .
you know , i never knew why i hated that song so much .
but tonight ...
you helped me figure it out .
i--i did , huh ?
yeah , you did .
that &apos;s the song you played when you raped me .
what ?
i was hoping you &apos;d come back .
tissue inflammation is consistent
with inhalation of some sort of drug .
i can &apos;t tell what yet .
and the ligature marks ?
same as before .
new wounds on top of old scares .
no sexual assault , though . possibly because
she regained consciousness at some point
and fought back .
she doesn &apos;t show any signs of defensive wounds .
no , but i did fish this out of her trachea .
neoprene .
from a glove .
my best guess is she bit him .
not enough to break the skin , unfortunately .
an exam glove ?
most likely .
actually , it &apos;s a surgical glove .
a little bit thicker than an exam glove .
if he was wearing neoprene , it means he has an allergy to latex .
i &apos;ll have garcia check hospital records .
what the hell ?
he @-@ help !
somebody help me !
hello ? !
hello ? ! is there somebody there ?
do you recognize this outfit ?
i wore it the night we met .
i don &apos;t remember exactly ,
but friends heard me say i was going outside for a smoke .
who are you ?
you really don &apos;t remember ?
no . uh , l @-@ last night , we met last night .
that &apos;s ok .
because i remember you .
pieces of you , anyway .
i guess because i was your first ,
you didn &apos;t know how to drug me right ,
and i kept coming to .
what are you talking about ?
i remember how you were panting behind your mask ,
and how your sweat
dripped on my skin .
but most of all ...
ok , this is a misunderstanding .
i remember that song .
so first he evolves to revictimizing these women .
then he evolves again to killing them .
the story &apos;s in the press . he knows we &apos;re hunting him .
the murders , like the gloves , are a countermeasure .
right . he &apos;s a rapist first and foremost .
that &apos;s his primary motivation .
so then why not rape vanessa campbell for the second time ?
he lost control when she fought back .
he couldn &apos;t risk her identifying him .
ok , maybe that &apos;s his new primary motivation .
he wants to stay hidden .
but look at all the details we &apos;ve learned about him already .
the victims could have more clues to his identity
locked away in their subconscious .
so he kills them before we can unlock it .
go ahead , garcia .
sir , i have struck out on surgeons .
in fact , none of the survivors
saw the same two healthcare professionals
or went to the same hospitals .
but then , i asked myself ,
what would ssa hotchner do ?
and i imagined myself in a really good suit ,
and i widened my search .
what did you find out ?
i found an orderly whose name is herman scobie ,
who rotates shifts at 3 different hospitals .
the same hospitals the victims go to ?
yes , indeed they are . and according to the hospital networks ,
accessed their insurance months after the attacks .
that &apos;s how he finds the victims a second time .
we should talk to him .
diana .
he killed vanessa ?
yes .
he could be after any one of us now , right ?
is this because of what i played last night ?
wait , stop ! no ! wait .
it &apos;s a stupid , cheesy song .
i only learned it so i could serenade my wife
when i asked her to marry me .
you can &apos;t even lie convincingly .
it &apos;s not a lie .
you sang &quot; total eclipse of the heart &quot; to your wife ?
it &apos;s kind of a crap song to propose to .
but it wasn &apos;t .
that--that &apos;s not what i played last night .
you &apos;re confused . ok ?
look , i can , uh , i can prove it to you .
there are certain things that you notice
when you &apos;re a lifelong smoker .
i could tell that it tasted funny ,
so i crushed it .
i guess i got enough , because i was out , but ...
i wasn &apos;t out out , you know ?
because you didn &apos;t inhale as much as the other victims .
all right ? ok .
this is what i played last night .
it &apos;s the same song .
no , it &apos;s not .
listen . listen .
it is the same song .
it &apos;s the same . what , do you think i can &apos;t hear that ?
no ! no !
it &apos;s the same song !
wait , stop .
it was--it was written by the same guy .
that &apos;s why it sounds like it &apos;s the same song .
prove it . how do they go ?
i woke up ...
in his van .
he wore a mask .
i never saw his face .
but there were other things ,
things that were different from what you described .
things he did ?
things he didn &apos;t do .
he didn &apos;t tie me up .
and there wasn &apos;t a song .
he talked to me , but there wasn &apos;t a song .
do you remember what he said ?
no .
when he was done , he bashed my head into the floor of his van .
fbi !
out the back !
what are you doing ? what is---- what is this ?
sometimes in my dreams ...
i can still hear his voice .
ok . ok . ok . ok .
this one goes ...
and i know
 just how to whisper
right ?
and the other one goes ...
turn around
bright eyes
you see ?
thank you .
why you running ?
why do you come to my house waving guns around ?
because we &apos;re looking for a rapist and a killer .
you know anyone like that ?
not me .
morgan .
neoprene .
that is you .
i know you &apos;re him .
you see , you didn &apos;t just play that song over and over again
when you ravaged me 5 years ago .
you sang it .
the same way you sang it right now .
that--that &apos;s your proof ?
it &apos;s all i need .
you got the wrong guy . you &apos;re making a mistake .
oh ! for god &apos;s sake ! it &apos;s not me !
i &apos;m not the guy !
yeah . it &apos;s you .
oh , my god !
you know , according to wikipedia ,
you &apos;ve got 48 hours before gangrene sets in .
less if i starve you .
so , uh ... you want a sandwich or something ?
what &apos;s the point ?
you &apos;ve already decided who i am .
um , the point is you &apos;ve ruined my life ,
and i want to make you take responsibility for that .
i never did anything to you you didn &apos;t want .
what ?
do you see this ?
this made my mother cry in the examination room
when the police took photos of it .
and these , here .
these made my father ask me
if i had too much to drink that night .
and ...
this one .
this one was so deep that my fiance decided
that he could never touch me again .
now , is that what you really think ,
that i wanted this ?
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m talking about .
you mixed me up .
just like you did the songs .
where &apos;s my lawyer ?
we called him .
he &apos;s on his way . i &apos;ll tell you what--
i &apos;m gonna let him fill you in on the piano man investigation .
on the what ?
the piano man .
you might have read about him .
a little .
what , you think i &apos;m him ?
no .
at least i don &apos;t .
the problem is , the way you treat some of your dates
is a little similar to this guy .
now , i &apos;m not judging .
some guys like it rough .
in fact ...
never mind .
no , go ahead .
no , i can &apos;t .
maybe you already did .
most of the people here
aren &apos;t as understanding as i am .
so , between us ,
did you ever get a little too rough ?
heat of the moment ?
never .
never ?
never .
what about those naughty girls who came back for seconds ?
what about them ?
they &apos;re the ones screeching the loudest .
what i need from you is a reason to kick them to the curb .
look at the notches on their bedpost .
you think they &apos;re innocent ?
that &apos;s a good one .
besides , nobody believes a slut
who cries wolf .
right ?
i &apos;m gonna quote you on that .
that--that--that was just something i told myself
after the second time . how did he--
your brain remembers details
no matter how hard you try to forget it .
it &apos;s just like the song .
it &apos;s him .
we got a positive i.d.
we &apos;ll arraign him .
we &apos;re not done . we &apos;re gonna stay and help the d.a.
build an airtight case .
gonna be tough if most of the victims can &apos;t identify him .
that &apos;s why we use his signature against him .
we establish a link between each of the victims and her song .
how does that work , exactly ?
are we gonna enter his song library into evidence ?
if it &apos;s relevant , yes .
we &apos;ll categorize every piece of music he owns ,
every mp3 , cd , old cassettes , everything .
and we establish these songs
were important to him and we go at him again .
he &apos;s lawyering up .
he raped 12 women and he killed one .
we &apos;re gonna make every charge stick .
hello .
what ?
i know .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s great .
um , listen , can i call you back ?
ok .
... confirmed that an arrest has been made in the piano man case .
the suspect &apos;s name has not been released yet ,
but a spokesman for the houston police has confirmed
he is in custody and could be arraigned as early as this evening .
what did you mean ?
what did i mix up ?
we &apos;ve met before .
just not the way you remember .
evanescence . linkin park .
and nickelback .
so herman scobie &apos;s into that nu @-@ metal goth stuff .
yeah , and his tramp stamp probably spells out &quot; massengill . &quot;
this guy doesn &apos;t even have any rage against the machine .
i rock .
how old were you
when you started listening to that band ?
uh , i was probably a teenager . why ?
14 is when we start to make our own musical choices .
our cognitive development evolves at that age
and we start to form our own cultural identity .
we stop listening to the music that our parents put on
and we start listening to the music that our friends listen to .
and those musical experiences imprint on us .
our hormonal surges as teenagers
may make the choices seem more personal and passionate .
and later on in life we
might experiment with other musical selections ,
but no music ever impacts us
as much as that which we listen to at age 14 .
herman scobie &apos;s what , 30 ?
if that .
ok , so mid- to late nineties is when he started
to take music seriously , stuff like this .
and the piano man &apos;s songs were all early eighties .
which means the signature doesn &apos;t fit .
herman scobie &apos;s too young to be the piano man .
i used to go to this bar , the golden gun . you know it ?
i &apos;ve been to lots of bars .
this one was special .
they had a happy hour every wednesday night .
and every wednesday night i &apos;d be there .
and every wednesday night i &apos;d notice this woman .
long blond hair , horn @-@ rimmed glasses .
every week she &apos;d let a different guy pick her up .
it was like a deal .
she could come back but he couldn &apos;t .
you remember the bar now ?
yeah .
yeah .
one night , she was so trashed ,
i couldn &apos;t understand what she was saying .
it was &quot; your place . &quot;
and when we got there ,
she told me ...
not to ask her about them .
that &apos;s when i saw the scars .
the next morning she was gone .
i kept my side of the bargain .
i never went back .
but i wondered about her .
who she was .
what happened to her .
now i see these same scars on my wrist ...
and i have my answer , don &apos;t i ?
you think you know me ?
i know who you are , regina .
how can herman scobie not be the piano man ?
we &apos;ve got the medical gloves , the medical records he pulled .
the taunt he said to diana mitchell he repeated to us .
scobie definitely assaulted diana the second time .
he &apos;s probably re @-@ victimizing all of the survivors .
but apply the profile to herman scobie
and look at what &apos;s different .
there &apos;s no piano wire and there &apos;s no song played .
you think there are two unsubs , the piano man and a copycat ?
a copycat studies the original unsub in order to learn .
herman scobie &apos;s a doppelganger .
he &apos;s trying to pass himself off as the piano man .
why ?
convenience , maybe .
if he assaults the piano man &apos;s survivors ,
they &apos;re less likely to reach out to the police .
and if they do , women claim it was the piano man .
no one thinks to look at hospital orderlies .
so who killed vanessa campbell ,
the piano man or scobie ?
it &apos;s a lay @-@ up . same neoprene
glove in her throat as we found in scobie &apos;s van .
there &apos;s something odd about that , too , though .
if vanessa campbell swallowed this ,
it would be scarred by digestive acids .
even if it got caught in her trachea as he choked her out ,
gastric reflux would be evident , but there isn &apos;t any .
so the unsub placed that in her throat postmortem .
which unsub ?
he used the piano wire , he played the song ,
it must have been the piano man .
so he plants a piece of evidence to frame scobie .
ok , let me get this straight .
the piano man is trying to convince us
that scobie is responsible for all of these crimes .
and if these two have studied each other this closely ,
then scobie is the key to finding the piano man .
his lawyer &apos;s here . scobie &apos;s not gonna talk to us .
he will when he finds out he &apos;s been set up .
my client has nothing to say .
good . we &apos;d rather he listen , anyway .
you &apos;re going away for rape .
the question is whether you &apos;ll let your competition
hang vanessa campbell &apos;s murder on you as well .
i didn &apos;t kill her .
i didn &apos;t even touch her . - herman .
from what you &apos;ve told us ,
we know exactly what you think of these women .
you don &apos;t need to kill them .
they &apos;re not worth that much effort to you .
but the piano man can &apos;t take that risk .
when he &apos;d heard what you &apos;d done , he killed vanessa campbell .
he went back to an old victim ,
just like you ,
but then placed a piece of neoprene down her throat .
does that sound like an accident ?
he &apos;s setting you up .
i need to discuss this with my client .
no , he talks to us now or he takes his chances with a jury .
what do you want to know ?
who is he ?
i never met him .
i just read about what he did
in the hospital records .
a weird thing , though .
what ?
i had two chicks picked out to do next .
i was gonna start with vanessa , but ...
he got to her first .
who was the other one ?
regina lampert .
regina ?
what are you doing ?
regina , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m begging you ,
i &apos;ve lost a lot of blood .
i need to go to the hospital .
regina ?
no ...
ok , guys , regina lampert is not answering her phone ,
and i found something hinky on her ,
which i &apos;m sending to your tablets .
all right , garcia , what are we looking at ?
it &apos;s surveillance video
from the bar that regina lampert works at .
do you see the guy she &apos;s talking to ?
playing the piano . he &apos;s taunting her .
she knows it , too . look at her body language .
watch what happens when i fast @-@ forward to closing time .
she seems to warm up to him .
and then watch this .
garcia , freeze it right there .
look at her face . no , she doesn &apos;t .
she &apos;s set herself up as bait .
credit card says that the guy at the piano
is hamilton bartholomew . this is what i know--
his wife just filed a missing persons report on him this morning .
she directed me to some job he just applied for ,
so i did a background check
from that where they did his fingerprints .
all right , garcia , pull regina lampert &apos;s rape kit
and cross @-@ reference the prints found and see if you get a match .
we need to get to her house .
sending her address into your gps .
godspeed .
garcia , did she pick up ?
no , but we did get a 911 call from her house
and it is freaking weird .
911 operator . what &apos;s your emergency ?
hello ?
my name is hamilton bartholomew .
i &apos;m being held captive by a lunatic !
she took the piano man captive ?
unless he &apos;s not the piano man . i mean , think about it .
would the piano man call us to rescue him ?
she could be shooting at the wrong guy .
garcia , keep trying the house .
it &apos;s the lab . they &apos;ve run the fingerprints .
hello ?
fbi !
i got him ! i caught him !
this is the piano man .
no , i &apos;m not . this woman &apos;s crazy .
regina , look at me .
look at me . drop the gun , ok ?
please don &apos;t let her kill me .
i have waited 5 years for this .
we ran the rape kit , regina .
the fingerprint the police got off your glasses .
do you remember ? we compared it to hamilton &apos;s .
it didn &apos;t match .
that &apos;s impossible .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s him .
that &apos;s him .
if you pull that trigger ,
you &apos;re gonna kill an innocent man .
but ... but ...
drop the gun .
but ...
it &apos;s ...
can you walk ? - yeah . yeah . i can walk .
i have to put these on you . do you understand ?
this is for both of our safety .
hamilton bartholomew ,
you &apos;re under arrest for the rapes of 12 women
and the murder of vanessa campbell .
i was told that you would only give your statement to me .
why didn &apos;t you let me pull the trigger ?
because you would be in prison .
as opposed to where i am right now ?
i mean , while he gets a lawyer
and a fair trial .
he will never see the light of day , ever .
can you guarantee that ?
you know , when they talk about victims
getting revictimized by the system ,
they mean you .
i know it &apos;s hard--
no , you don &apos;t .
you have no idea what it &apos;s like ...
when the monster from your nightmares comes back for you .
wait--
look , i &apos;m here as a courtesy .
something happened to you
do you want to give me your statement or not ?
what did you do to him , huh ?
did you arrest him like a good fbi agent ?
or did you kill him ?
i didn &apos;t pull the trigger .
still ,
your monster &apos;s dead .
i have to live with mine .
that &apos;s my statement .
&quot; all the art of living lies in a fine mingling
of letting go and holding on . &quot;
henry ellis .
