but i tell you what-- there are parts of my butt
only a tub can clean .
ew , but okay !
okay , here &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do ,
so the guys don &apos;t know .
we &apos;re gonna split the 400 bucks for the tub .
then we can hide it on the roof
and install it in the middle of the night , and then
we can just pretend like you did it without our permission .
or we could just ...
say that you wanted a tub , too .
how about we just keep this a jess and winston thing ?
hey , cece , you okay ?

and he hasn &apos;t said anything to me since .
so terrible .
i just , i can &apos;t even ...
i mean that &apos;s ... but i mean ...
