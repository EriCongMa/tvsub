the.one.with.the.pediatrician
here you go , rach .

you know what ? i &apos;m not even sure i can have caffeine .

just to be sure , i &apos;m gonna call dr. wiener .
every time ?
you don &apos;t have to call him whenever you have a question , okay ?
trust me . i know this .
all right . i trust you .
i can see you dialing . i don &apos;t understand why ..
i &apos;m on the phone ! dr. wiener ?
it &apos;s so weird seeing ross and rachel with a baby . it &apos;s just so grownup .
i know , yeah .
i feel like we &apos;re all growing up .
a person named &quot; wiener . &quot; god , that kills me
look at you all grownup .
well , actually , you know what ?
i am , you know ?
well , that whole thing with rachel made me realize ..
that maybe i &apos;m ready for a more serious relationship , you know ?
like , i &apos;d like to meet a
nice , mature , commitment @-@ minded lady .
and looks aren &apos;t as important as ..
nah , she &apos;s gotta be hot .
you know , i might know somebody .
how about you set me up with someone , and we double @-@ date ?
i can do that . yeah . how &apos;s friday ?
done !
all right .
good , really ? okay , let &apos;s see .
all right .
you know who &apos;s great ? sandy poopack .
&quot; poopack &quot; ?
yeah . all right . well , that rules out lana titwyler .
i &apos;ve got good news .
you got out of the whole tulsa thing ?
okay , i have news .
you don &apos;t have to move to tulsa . you can stay here and keep your job .
that &apos;s great ! how ?
my boss and i worked out a deal where i &apos;m in tulsa four days a week .
so the other three , i can be here with you .
so you &apos;re gonna be gone four days a week ?
no .
i &apos;m sorry , are you just used to saying that ?
no . i can &apos;t be away from you for that long .
really ?
yeah , you &apos;re my husband .
i won &apos;t live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year .
that &apos;s fast math . we could use you in tulsa .
thanks for trying to figure out a way , but if you go to tulsa , i go with you .
you said that without gagging .
i know !
well , excuse me ?
oh , yeah ? well , up yours too !
who the hell was that ?
dr. wiener .
rach , you can &apos;t call people at 3 : 00 in the morning .
you know what ? you sound just like his wife .
was there anything even wrong with emma ?
yes , of course there is ! okay ? i &apos;m not insane .
what was it ?
hiccups .
i told you , you can &apos;t call him every time any little thing comes up .
well , not anymore i can &apos;t . he fired us !
can you believe that ?
i could believe it if he came here and hit you over the head with a copy of highlights .
what are we gonna do ? we have to find a pediatrician .
wait , monica said that when you guys were growing up ..
you liked your doctor . what was his name ?
dr. gettleman ?
yeah , no , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
in fact , i think he &apos;s dead .
why does everything happen to me ?
i promise , first thing tomorrow , we &apos;ll find another doctor .
but i gotta get up early , and i &apos;m not feeling well .
you &apos;re not feeling well ? what do you have ? rubella ?
because don &apos;t go near emma , she has not had that shot .
you know , come to think of it , it does feel rubella @-@ like .
wiener !
wiener ! wiener ! wiener !
rachel !
great ! now he &apos;s gonna know it was me !
and the kung pao chicken .
utensils and plates for one .
and can you read the order back to me ?
great .
yeah . okay , thanks . bye .
so how is this for our big double date tonight ?
oh , my god .
great . just the reaction i was hoping for .
yeah , so you found someone for me ? you didn &apos;t forget ?
of course not . and you &apos;ll love mary ellen .
she &apos;s really smart and cute and funny and ..
i can &apos;t tell you how i know this , but she is not opposed to threesomes .
all right .
so tell me something about my guy .
no .
come on , give me something . what &apos;s his name ?
i &apos;m not sure i understand the question .
what do they call him ?
mike .
mike . okay , what &apos;s his last name ?
damn it ! is there no mystery left in romance anymore ? !
we &apos;ll see you and mike at the restaurant in a couple hours .
all right , great . see you . bye @-@ bye .
why &apos;d i have to say mike ? i don &apos;t know a mike ! why couldn &apos;t i have said .. ?
there &apos;s no guys in there !
so this is being a parent , huh ?
i think i can handle this .
too intense . too intense .
well , i did it .
i told my crew at the restaurant i &apos;m heading off to tulsa .
oh , yeah ? how &apos;d they take it .
pretty well . yeah .
they were brave little soldiers .
did their best to be stoic .
some of them even high @-@ fived each other to mask their pain .
it &apos;s impossible to find a good doctor . how do you know the good ones ..
from the ones who &apos;ll push their penis against your knee ?
excuse me ?
i know what she &apos;s talking about .
you probably also had the piano teacher with the wandering hands .
well , we &apos;ve gotta find a new pediatrician .
ross was getting sick last night , and emma may have caught it .
why don &apos;t you see dr. gettleman ?
ross said he died .
he didn &apos;t die . i just saw his daughter last week .
she said he was fine . her , on the other hand , botched botox .
great . well then , i &apos;m gonna take emma to see him .
i wonder why ross said that he died ?
maybe he confused him with his childhood therapist .
he saw a therapist ?
he used to have a recurring nightmare . it freaked him out .
wow , what was it ?
that i was going to eat him .
mike !
yeah ?
okay .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m doing this with you .
although i did just end a nine @-@ year relationship ..
so i should be open to taking some risks .
that &apos;s good . get all that boring stuff out now .
everything is gonna be fine . follow my lead , okay ?
all you have to do is pretend to be mike .
i am mike .
attaboy .
here they come .
i &apos;m phoebe .
phoebe . mike . how you doing ?
nice to meet you .
joey , this is mary ellen jenkins .
so , mike , how do you and joey know each other , anyway ?
how do joey and i know each other ?
if i had a nickel for every time somebody &apos;s asked me that .
from school .
we met in college .
i mean high school .
you guys go way back , then . so , what are you up to these days ?
well , i &apos;m a lawyer .
mike , attorney at law !
actually , i just gave up my practice .
what ?
that &apos;s the kind of thing you usually run by me .
i want to play piano professionally . if i don &apos;t do this now , i never will .
great . i like that better than the lawyer thing .
which is why i waited until now to introduce you to mike .
you thought he was still a lawyer .
no , that &apos;s not what i meant . let &apos;s get you a cocktail .
what are you doing ?
looking for restaurant jobs for you in tulsa .
that &apos;s so sweet . did you find anything ?
slim pickins .
nothing , huh ?
no . slim pickins . it &apos;s a barbecue joint .
they &apos;re looking for a cook . actually , &quot; cook &quot; may be a bit of a stretch .
they &apos;re looking for somebody to shovel mesquite .
&quot; slim pickins &quot; ? that is so cheesy .
well , so cheesy also has an opening .
honey , that &apos;s okay . i know this woman , nancy ..
who &apos;s a restaurant biz headhunter . she may know something .
can i say how much i appreciate you coming with me ?
when we get to tulsa , i am taking you for a great dinner at slim pickins .
so cheesy ?
whole hog ?
it &apos;s gonna be tough to keep kosher in tulsa .
hi , nancy ? hi , it &apos;s monica geller .
i &apos;m good . listen , i &apos;m looking for a job in tulsa .
yeah , well , my husband &apos;s been relocated .
because i love him .
no , i don &apos;t want a job in new york .
javu &apos;s looking ? oh , my god !
he asked for me personally ? oh , my god !
wow , this is really , really flattering .
but i &apos;m moving to tulsa .
so , just , if you would tell javu ..
i &apos;ll take it !
my name &apos;s rachel greene . i have an appointment for emma .
dr. gettleman is finishing up with a patient . he &apos;ll be out shortly .
i think you just have a cold . it &apos;s definitely not strep .
thanks , doctor .
would you like a lollipop ?
do you even have to ask ?
he is alive !
it &apos;s so surprising that you and joey have known each other for so long ..
and i &apos;ve never heard about you .
that &apos;s because we had a bit of a falling out .
mike hit my mom with a car .
no , i didn &apos;t .
that &apos;s okay . i have forgiven you .
now we &apos;re friends again , and everything &apos;s great .
well , wait . is your mom okay ?
please , we &apos;re trying to have a conversation .
you &apos;re a lot nicer on days of our lives .
days of our lives ! that &apos;s why you look so familiar !
what ?
what ?
what ?
do you not know each other ?
of course we do . he &apos;s playing a game we used to play in high school .
we pretend we don &apos;t know each other . we played all kinds of games .
you remember that one where i punch you in the face for not being cool ?
let me ask you something : how many sisters does joey have ?
six .
no , he doesn &apos;t . he has seven .
what are you doing ? i said seven !
joey , why did you set me up with a stranger ?
because i forgot about our date . i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m sorry too . and just to be clear , i didn &apos;t hit his mother with a car .
although i &apos;d like to be hit by one right now .
yeah , no problem .
you are unbelievable . i spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you .
mary ellen is really smart and cute and loose .
hey
who are you kidding ?
you find some guy off the street for me ?
god , this is humiliating !
i &apos;m so sorry . if you don &apos;t like this guy , i can find you a better one .
mike ? mike ?
i &apos;m out of here .
it was nice meeting you .
you &apos;re leaving too ?
i &apos;ll stay if you can tell me my name .
have a good night .
we leave tomorrow , and you still have a lot to pack .
you &apos;re right .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t go .
what ?
so nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant , javu ?
but it &apos;s just a little outside of tulsa .
well , how far outside ?
manhattan ?
and you &apos;re thinking of taking it ?
before , you said that being with me was more important than any job .
but i guess now it &apos;s old job , me , new job .
i &apos;m gonna miss this hand !
i know this is a lot to ask ..
but , my god , this is a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime opportunity .
what happened to &quot; you can &apos;t live without me four days a week &quot; ?
well , if you really think about it , i mean , four days is not that long .
i see you monday before you go to work ..
and thursday when you get back ..
and i always work late on tuesdays , so really if you think about it ..
it &apos;s really just one day .
and well , if we can &apos;t make it one day , we got real problems , my friend .
i think you should take the job .
really ?
i know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey .
that &apos;s the nicest thing anybody &apos;s ever said to me .
it &apos;s your dream job . i can &apos;t make you pass it up .
besides , i &apos;m proud of you .
you are ?
yeah .
and when i get to tulsa and people say , &quot; where &apos;s the missus .. &quot;
i &apos;ll tell them she &apos;s a chef at javu .
and then , when they stare at me blankly ..
i &apos;ll make some offensive tulsa joke , and thus , begin my isolation .
how was the pediatrician ?
i really liked him .
yeah , yeah . it was really , really , really good .
you promised not to say anything .
i know .
ross still sees his pediatrician !
i don &apos;t care .
are you serious ? you still see dr. gettleman ?
he is a brilliant diagnostician !
diagnostician or boo @-@ boo fixer ?
seriously , you gotta go to an appropriate doctor .
and not an orthodontist ..
not a gynecologist ..
and not a veterinarian ..
why ? i know it &apos;s a little weird , but he is a great doctor , okay ?
he knows my medical history .
and every time i go in there , he makes a big deal .
you know , &quot; look , it &apos;s my favorite patient . &quot;
does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your tushy ?
i seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college .
that was not a security blanket . that was a wall hanging .
it didn &apos;t spend much time on the wall !
excuse me .
hi . i was hoping to run into you . can we talk ?
sure .
yeah . there &apos;s someone i want you to meet .
this is my best friend from high school .
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t think i know you .
how hard was that ?
look , i &apos;m sorry , really . i &apos;m so embarrassed .
please .
really , i &apos;m a pretty nice guy . just ask my parole officer .
apparently , i &apos;m not a funny guy .
well , why did you go along with that ?
because i was told that i &apos;d get a free dinner , which i didn &apos;t .
and that i &apos;d meet a pretty girl , which i did .
that &apos;s true .
well , is anything you told me about yourself true ?
my name is mike . and i do play piano .
prove it .
there isn &apos;t a piano here .
that wouldn &apos;t stand in the way of a true pianist .
okay .
you are really good .
i play a little guitar myself .
really ? that &apos;s great .
what kind of music do you play ?
like acoustic , folksy stuff , you know ?
but right now i &apos;m working on a couple lron maiden covers .
do you think that , maybe , sometime , i could ..
it &apos;s okay . go ahead , ask me out .
okay . you think , maybe , sometime i could take you out ?
you just caught me off guard .
yeah , that would be nice .
look at this ! my two best friends !
excuse me . i don &apos;t mean to be a jerk ..
but the baby with the rash came in after me .
the doctor will be right with you , sir .
i hear you ..
but do you have any harder puzzles ?
mommy , i can &apos;t find waldo .
what page are you on ?
what , the circus ? he &apos;s behind the elephant .
wow . so your child &apos;s a big fan of the waldo books too ?
yeah , that &apos;s how i know .
i &apos;m ross , by the way .
hi , i &apos;m sally .
so no ring . can i assume you &apos;re also a single parent ?
i am a single parent .
it &apos;s hard , isn &apos;t it ?
there &apos;s no time for a social life . where are you gonna meet someone ?
well ..
mommy , i can &apos;t ..
sea shore ? row boat .
let &apos;s say , i don &apos;t know , you met someone in the pediatrician &apos;s office .
rossie ? we &apos;re ready for you .
yeah ..
come on , ross jr . it &apos;s time to go in .
mommy .
mommy , what &apos;s wrong with that man ?
hey , i helped you find waldo !
good , you haven &apos;t left yet .
where have you been ?
i got held up at dr. gettleman &apos;s office .
there was some guy that freaked everybody out .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m going back there .
you got here just in time . i really have to go , buddy .
oh , man .
promise to call me when you land ?
of course i will . i love you .
i love you too .

what &apos;s the matter , joe ?
i &apos;m mad at you for leaving .
you know , you &apos;re nothing but a big leaver .
a big leaver with a stupid suitcase .
any chance you &apos;re trying to pick a fight to make all of this easier ?
dude , you see right through me !
okay , well .. bye , mon .
bye , ross . rachel .
bye , emma .

i love you so much .
i know that too .
