carlos &apos; niece arrived
we want you to be part of this family ,
but you will obey our rules .
lynette and tom got big news .
we &apos;re gonna have another baby .
twins
you would actually send your wife to prison ?
my wife--no . my ex @-@ wife--you bet .
orson resorted to blackmail .
i think you &apos;re the most fascinating woman
that i have ever met .
and karl made his move .
katherine &apos;s marriage to mike ...
that woman i was with -- tell her i had to go .
it &apos;s an emergency .
... was put on hold .
you guys are in danger . get out of that car .
get away from dave .
and when the dust settled , wedding bells rang
for someone .
the veil was made from the finest silk .
the garter was trimmed with handmade lace .
the shoes were designed by the top couturier in milan .
the bride wanted only the best for her wedding day
because she was about to marry
the best man in the world ...
for the second time .
how do you feel ?
like the worse person in the world .
don &apos;t do this to yourself .
katherine is never gonna forgive me for this .
mom , this is your day .
you and mike were meant to be together .
wish me luck .
then by the power vested in me ,
i now pronounce you
husband and wife .
you may kiss the bride .
yes , the bride wanted the best wedding money could buy
but as she left the altar , it suddenly occurred to her ...
sorry i &apos;m late . did i miss anything ?
she should &apos;ve spent more on security .
it &apos;s not hard to find sin in the suburbs .
just look behind closed doors .
that &apos;s where you &apos;ll find your neighbors
cheating on their taxes ...
and drinking too much vodka ...
and stealing their father &apos;s magazines .
yes , the suburbs are filled with sinners ,
some of who occasionally ... repent .
we can &apos;t do this .
it &apos;s adultery .
luckily , we &apos;re both adults .
mmm. stop ! i &apos;m married .
yes , to a man who &apos;s blackmailing you .
don &apos;t you think making love to your divorce lawyer
would be a nifty way to get back at him ?
oh , karl . no . no !
what now ?
if i &apos;m gonna break a commandment ,
i don &apos;t want it to be for a quickie on this couch .
who said quickie ? i &apos;ve got 40 minutes before my 10 : 00 .
and thou shalt get sweaty .
i wanna do this . i do . but not here .
i need to feel special .
but you are special .
are you saying
you &apos;ve never made love to another woman on this couch ?
not a special woman .
okay . all right .
i get it . i get it .
i want this to be nice for you . i &apos;ll find us a hotel .
call me later when you &apos;ve set something up .
done .
and just so we &apos;re clear , this visit was not billable .
morning . i &apos;m late for school . i don &apos;t have time for breakfast .
at least take a muffin .
thank you , uncle carlos .
kind of warm for a sweatshirt , isn &apos;t it ?
oh , it gets really cold in the classroom .
mm. stop .
lift it up .
gaby .
girls who spend an hour on makeup
do not wear baggy sweatshirts . lift it .
well , that oughta heat up the classroom .
go and change .
gaby , what is your problem ?
all the girls in my class dress like this .
that &apos;s why your school nurse is an obstetrician .
wear something else .
fine . i &apos;ll borrow one of your tops .
it might be exciting for it to go someplace
besides the supermarket .
oh , snap !
hey , you i can hit .
do you see what i have to put up with ?
it was just a shirt .
yeah ?
and when she came home past curfew ,
it was just 40 minutes .
and when she took money from my purse ,
it was just $ 5 .
why do you always make excuses for her ?
she &apos;s had a sad life .
her mom &apos;s in jail . her dad walked out .
yeah , yeah ,
she &apos;s one dead dog away from a country song .
i don &apos;t care .
maybe she would calm down
if she felt a little more secure here .
i &apos;m not signing those papers .
we need to be her legal guardians .
and look after her for the next two years ? no .
until i see a change in her behavior ,
i &apos;m keeping all my options open .
is this better ?
yes . very nice . thank you .
stop .
mmm . what do i smell ?
despair . mortality . paralyzing fear .
oh . i thought it was waffles .
do you realize that
when these twins finish high school ,
i &apos;ll be in my 60s ?
no .
no , you &apos;ll be in your , uh ...
at their graduation ,
i will be the crazy old lady with oatmeal on her chin .
look , i know this wasn &apos;t planned ,
but we--we can do this .
i mean , we had a lot of fun raising the first four kids .
but we were done , tom .
we were across the finish line .
no more diapers .
no more strained carrots .
no more reading stupid &quot; goodnight , moon &quot; !
lynette--
and with preston going to europe ,
we even had one moving out !
we will never be done
if we birth two every time one moves out !
that &apos;s just math !
eight and half months to go .
yay .
are you all right ?
you know what &apos;s funny ?
i was never able to picture us old together ,
sitting on the porch , gray hair .
i tried ,
but i could never see it .
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , katherine , you don &apos;t have to--
mike , please .
i don &apos;t need another reminder of you .
so ... how &apos;d it go ? how was she ?
she was ... okay .
&quot; okay &quot; ? what does that mean ?
i mean , did you tell her everything ?
did you tell her we &apos;re getting married ?
yeah . i think she &apos;s trying to take the high road .
the high road ?
um , as in , &quot; i wish you and susan the best &quot; ?
or the high road as in , &quot; when i cut susan &apos;s brake line ,
she &apos;ll careen off the high road &quot; ?
well , she knows it &apos;s over ,
and she &apos;s dealing with it .
mm , that must have been really hard for you .
yeah , it was .
but now that she knows , it &apos;ll be easier when you talk to her .
me talk to her ?
uh , why ? why ? why ?
i--you &apos;re the one who was dating her ,
i &apos;m--i just ... i don &apos;t ...
i think we &apos;re good now .
honey , you &apos;re gonna have to deal with her at some point .
fine . yes , i will . i will .
um , just , uh , not today , &apos; cause today julie &apos;s coming home
and , uh ... you know , i wanna get her settled in .
so ... what about tomorrow ?
ooh , that &apos;s not good either ,
&apos;cause julie and i are gonna pick out my wedding dress .
you live right across the street from her .
you can &apos;t avoid her for the next 50 years .
well , not 50 .
just till she &apos;s too old to throw things .
don &apos;t worry about it .
i think katherine &apos;s really gonna surprise you .
all of the windows are triple pane energy efficient .
oh , and i should mention the hardwood floors were
completely redone recently . black walnut .
it &apos;sice .
so do you have any questions for me ?
nah , i think you pretty much got it covered .
really ? check me out !
i &apos;m--i &apos;m new at this . i just got my broker &apos;s license last week .
congratulations .
it &apos;s a pretty nice house for your first listing .
i got really lucky . the woman who handled
the properties in the neighborhood--
she slammed her car into a pole
and got fried by a power line .
like i said , congrats .
uh , mrs. bolen &apos;s been awfully quiet .
so what do you think ?
me ? i &apos;m thinkin &apos; you &apos;re full of crap .
i &apos;m sorry ?
well , the fact that we can afford this place
says to something is wrong with it .
so , uh , start talkin &apos; .
mold ? termites ? leaky roof ?
honestly , i have told you everything that i know .
sure , you could play it like that .
but if we do buy this place
and it turns into a money pit ,
i &apos;m gonna need to take my anger out on someone .
like maybe the realtor who made a big deal
out of telling us he lives right across the street ?
okay , well , i don &apos;t know
that this is actually considered a flaw ,
but a while ago , uh , the lady who was living here--
she was apparently going through kind of a tough time ,
and long story short , she committed suicide .
shot herself ...
in--in the head .
in this room .
that &apos;s it ?
well , yeah .
we &apos;ll take it .
really ? oh , that is so ... that is--
okay , i &apos;ll just--i &apos;ll just get the paperwork .
it &apos;s a nice place .
i think we could be happy here .
right , danny ?
why are you asking me ?
i didn &apos;t want to move here .
oh , honey .
whose fault was that ?
julie ! look at you !
欢迎收看
oh , angie , these are incredible .
what do you call &apos; em again ?
pizzelles . come on , eat up . i made six dozen .
my grandmother &apos;s recipes were always for 30 people .
trust me , she &apos;d fatten you four up in a week .
these go straight to your ass .
okay . i &apos;m sorry . do you guys not say &quot; ass &quot; ?
sure , we do .
come on , bree . show her .
so , uh , susan tells me
that your son is about to start college .
mm @-@ hmm . we &apos;re just dealing with some paperwork ,
but he should be startin &apos; sometime next week .
oh , i thought he was already in class .
uh , he asked julie to tutor him in math .
really ?
oh , that must be katherine .
i &apos;ll get it .
katherine ? y @-@ you didn &apos;t say katherine was coming .
she &apos;s just dropping something off .
what &apos;s the matter ? you &apos;ve seen her since this mike thing .
oh , yeah ... sorta . your voice just got very high .
your voice just got very high .
you have talked to her , haven &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m ... going to .
i &apos;ve just been so busy with all the wedding plans .
yeah , i wouldn &apos;t open with that .
i &apos;m just dropping off the menu
for the davenport anniversary party .
you finished that ? already ? it &apos;s three months away .
well , i have a lot of free time on my hands these days .
hello , susan .
hi , katherine .
how--how are you doing ?
haven &apos;t seen you in a while .
well , i &apos;ve been ...
using the back door a lot more lately .
katherine , your buttons ...
i don &apos;t know where my head is anymore .
whoa . was it just me
or was that the most awkward moment ever ?
you bet your sweet ass it was .
hon , could you get me a glass of water , please ?
you got it .
thanks .
it &apos;s our first .
yeah , i got that .
how about you ?
four at home , two on the way .
oh , big family . you &apos;re so blessed .
i just can &apos;t imagine anything better than being a mommy .
really ?
i mean , i know it &apos;s a lot of work ,
but luckily my husband plans to be really hands @-@ on .
yeah . that &apos;s not gonna happen .
pardon ?
oh , he &apos;ll be there at first ,
maybe even change a diaper or two
until the novelty wears off .
but those 4 : 00 a.m. feeding
he said he &apos;d help out with ? forget it .
oh , you don &apos;t know my johnny . he &apos;s different .
does he have boobs ?
no .
then you &apos;re the only bar in town .
that baby can scream into a bullhorn ,
and johnny won &apos;t budge .
o @-@ okay .
thanks .
i &apos;m not done .
you see this ?
you &apos;ll never wear a bikini again .
but you &apos;ve had four kids ,
and you look good .
you haven &apos;t seen me naked .
my stomach looks like spanish stucco .
and my breasts resemble two balloons
you &apos;d find behind the couch a week after the party .
most women say this is the greatest experience of theirife .
most women are liars .
my mother was liar ,
and her mother was a liar , and your mother is a liar .
it &apos;s a lie every generation tells the next
so they can get grandchildren .
please stop talking to me .
no , you need to hear this. you have to be prepared .
your children will hit you and steal from your purse .
your husband will begin
to buy your birthday presents at the car wash
and the kicker-- for the rest of yo life ,
there will be so many moments when you feel lonely ,
but you will never be alone .
they were out of water.is juice okay ?
hormones .
get used to it .
i cannot believe we are finally going to do this .
you &apos;re not an easy woman to pin down ,
but i sure am going tonjoy trying .
what ?
this is not what i was expecting .
hey , i think i look pretty good for my age .
not you , karl. the room .
it &apos;s filthy and hideous .
well , i took you to a nice hotel last week ,
and we had to leave &apos; cause you saw someone you knew .
who we gonna run into here ?
well , certainly not a cleaning lady .
okay , so it &apos;s a little dusty .
but trust me , once i get started , you &apos;ll never even notice .
my god , those sheets !
what &apos;s wrong with them ?
they &apos;re discolored , threadbare
and reek of industrial bleach .
you give me five minutes , they &apos;ll reek of us .
karl , i &apos;m not gonna lie on that revolting sheet ,
wondering how many junkies have died on it .
what do you want me to do about it ?
ooh , egyptian cotton !
these are pretty , aren &apos;t they ?
great. love &apos; em. let &apos;s go .
it doesn &apos;t help when you say that about every single set .
bree , an hour ago , i was half naked .
now , i am sheet shopping .
forgive me if i &apos;m an easy sell .
i &apos;m just not sure this colour will match the carpet .
i &apos;ll get them in blue .
i &apos;ll tell you what they &apos;ll match then .
fine , i &apos;ll take these .
now , we just neet to stop for some flowers .
flowers ?
i just want this affair to be nice .
you know , you don &apos;t want this affair to be nice .
you don &apos;t want it at all .
don &apos;t be silly .
of course i do .
you may think you do .
but i have been chasing you two weeks .
and you &apos;ve down nothing but throw up roadblocks .
&quot; not tonight . &quot;
&quot; not this hotel . &quot;
&quot; not those sheets . &quot;
karl
if you think i &apos;ve been leading you on , you &apos;re wrong .
bree , it &apos;s not your fault .
it &apos;s just who you are .
you &apos;re a good girl , never breaks the rules
no matter how miserable it makes her .
i thought a little karl time might brighten your day .
but there &apos;s not much i can do for someone
who &apos;d rather be good .
than happy .
can i help you ?
i &apos;ve got a delivery for susan mayer .
but she &apos;s not home .
do you mind signing for her ?
oh. that must be her gown .
of course i &apos;ll take it .
we do things like this for each other all the time .
in fact , just last month ,
she took in something of mine .
oh , god .
oh , god. oh , god. oh , god .
um , katherine , it &apos;s me .
i @-@ i &apos;ve just come over to pick up my ...
hello , susan .
okay , i did not see that coming .
it &apos;s just so beautiful .
i couldn &apos;t resist .
thank you for taking such good care of it .
but i should probably go now ,
so if you just wanna slip it off and ...
oh , wait . i have to check on my sauce .
sauce ?
doesn &apos;t that smell good ?
it smells done .
why don &apos;t you step away from the pot ?
oh , no. the secret is you have to keep stirring .
you know ,
i really love this fabric .
it feels so expensive .
it is .
that &apos;s why they had it all protected with that
acid @-@ free tissue paper and plastic garment bag .
maybe ...
i should give you some of this sauce to take to mike .
he used to love my sauce .
of course ,
he used to love me , too .
okay , enough with the sauce .
i want my dress back now .
of course . i &apos;m sorry .
can you please unzip me ?
it really is a beautiful dress .
katherine was actually wearing the dress ?
yes
stop blocking my light. keep blotting .
ugh ! mom , relax. we got all the spots .
no , i still see flecks of red .
it &apos;s your third wedding .
an all @-@ white dress is gonna be a stretch anyway .
do me a favor .
save the &quot; my mom &apos;s a slut &quot; jokes for the toast .
you think i should go talk to her again ?
what ? why ?
well , she &apos;s obviouy hurting more than i thought .
excuse me ,
she kidnapped my wedding dress
and held a pot of sauce to its head !
how could you possibly defend her ?
i &apos;m not defending her .
i &apos;m just a little concerned. aren &apos;t you ?
no ! i mean ...
yes , i was .
but at this point , i &apos;m a little sick of her .
do you know that
when i told people that i &apos;m getting married ,
no one says congratulations .
they all say , &quot; oh , my god. is katherine okay ?
how &apos;s katherine ? &quot;
does no one remember that you were with me first ?
she stole my leftovers. does nobody remember that ?
did she just refer me to be leftovers ?
my point is that i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
you and i have a child ,
and i am just tired of feeling like the other woman .
scary part is , of the two women you could marry ,
that &apos;s the stable one .
thanks for taking me to the store .
i promised roy i &apos;d make him meatloaf .
oh , i think it &apos;s sweet that
you found a male companion at this stage in your life .
roy &apos;s no companion. the man has seen paris .
that &apos;s right . i &apos;m back in the saddle .
it started one night when roy asked
if my bathtub was big enough for two--
hey ! you want me to crash the car ? &apos; cause i will .
hey , aunt gaby .
need your car washed ?
oh ! i &apos;m aunt gaby now ?
let me guess. you want something .
well , there is a party tomorrow night ...
really ? !
okay , you can go .
seriously ?
well , if you can make an effort around here ,
then i guess i can , too. just be home by 10 : 00 .
yeah , that &apos;s the thing .
the party doesn &apos;t start till 11 : 00 .
what kind of party start at 11 : 00 ?
this new dance club is opening downtown ,
and it is , like , the hottest thing ever .
everybody &apos;s going .
not everybody .
it &apos;s a school night , and you know the rules .
but thank you for washing the car .
well , she &apos;s quite the charmer .
do you see what i &apos;m dealing with ?
i mean , carlos and i basically took her off the street .
you &apos;d think she &apos;d be grateful. but every day is a battle .
i don &apos;t know how to get through to her .
teenage girls--they &apos;re the best reason for not having kids .
thank god roy had a vasectomy .
so based on the data given for this population ,
and using the standard deviation formula ,
what do you think this variable is ?
would you like to go to a movie sometime ?
it &apos;s not like it would be a date or anything .
we &apos;re friends , right ?
friends go to movies all the time .
i don &apos;t know if you know that .
did you know that ?
i did know that .
okay .
really ?
that &apos;s great .
hey , julie. nice to see you again .
danny , do me a favor and take the trash out , will ya ?
uh ... can i do it a little later ?
uh , yeah. yeah , you could ,
but i think you &apos;re gonna do it right now .
hey , thanks for doing that .
doing what ?
not shooting him down .
i know he &apos;s probably not your type .
no , i like him. he &apos;s nice .
yeah , yeah . clearly not in your league .
i &apos;m sorry you have to work late , sweetie .
don &apos;t worry about us. everything is fine here .
good night , ana .
oh ! sorry .
ana paid me $ 5 .
ooh ! hey , muscles . i need a lift .
ooh ! hey ! hands ! hands ! hands !
um , excuse me !
sorry to interrupt. but can i have your attention , please ?
okay. hi. my niece is somewhere in this building .
she &apos;s got brown hair , gold leggings , a cream top ...
which she took from my closet .
so if you could just look around and point her out ...
no , hey , hey , this is important , okay ? she &apos;s only 16 .
and she came here
even though she knew she wasn &apos;t supposed to .
either you find my niece ,
or i will call the cops with their drug @-@ sniffing dogs .
found her over here !
here she is ! stop . put me down .
somebody ...
get your hands off me . let me down .
god , what are you doing ?
thank you , everybody .
put the music back on .
i told you not to mess with me .
i cannot keep doing this , ana .
or what ? you &apos;re gonna throw me out ?
fine .
you &apos;d actually be doing me a favor .
i can take care of myself .
you &apos;re 16 . how exactly are you gonna make money ?
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m gonna be a model .
a model ?
yeah .
you know , people tell me that i &apos;m pretty enough .
i @-@ i will just--i &apos;ll go to paris or new york ,
and i will get discovered .
and i will be rich and famous ,
and no one will ever tell me what to do again .
and you really think it &apos;s that easy to become a model ?
it was for you .
what , you left home when you were only 15 .
no , i left because i had to . my stepfather was ...
not a nice man .
my mother didn &apos;t care about me .
my father left when i was 3,
and my mother &apos;s be in and out of prison ever since .
i can beat you at this game .
this is not a game , ana ! this is your life .
you can &apos;t scare me , all right ?
and i don &apos;t stay where i &apos;m not wanted .
oh , don &apos;t give me that .
we feed you. we put a roof over your head .
and you &apos;re also keeping all your options open .
i heard .
oh , good , you &apos;re back .
the girls haven &apos;t made a peep .
gaby ?
no more options .
i am now officially your guardian .
so ... what ?
i &apos;m supposed to hug you now ?
no , you &apos;re not gonna want to hug me ,
because from here on out ,
i am gonna be watching you like a hawk .
i wanna know where you are going ,
who you are going with ,
and when you are coming home .
and i &apos;m gonna keep you from ruining that life
you are so anxious to start living .
you are so mean .
yeah .
and i wish ...
i wish ...
someone had been this mean to me when i was your age .
danny , look , it &apos;s complicated .
no , it &apos;s really simple , julie .
you only care about yourself .
please let me explain !
go to hell .
katherine said you were here .
and i thought , since you were already in church ,
we might see the pastor
and schedule some counseling sessions .
i don &apos;t need counseling , orson . i need a divorce .
don &apos;t tell me we don &apos;t need counseling .
you &apos;ve been sleeping in the guest room for weeks .
it &apos;s not right .
i agree ,
and if you had an ounce of chivalry ,
you &apos;d have given me the master .
you might think that with holding sex
will make me give up on us .
but i can be very patient .
you do realize in prison ,
i went three whole years without any sex .
no , but thank you for clearing up a question
i never quite knew how to ask .
bree , eight years ago ,
we stood at an altar like this ,
and we made a vow before god to love each other .
do you think i haven &apos;t struggled with this ?
i &apos;ve struggled with this in ways
you can &apos;t even begin to imagine .
then let me help you . i can make you happy again .
how ? by blackmailing me ?
i &apos;m not your wife anymore , orson . i &apos;m your captive .
don &apos;t you feel any remorse at all over that ?
of course i do ,
but sometimes guilt
is a small price to pay for happiness .
there it is . baby number one .
oh , my god . it was so worth cutting class to hear this .
and ... there &apos;s number two . good , strong heartbeats .
isn &apos;t that great , lynette ?
yeah . terrific .
i &apos;ll ...
get the nurse , have her come clean you up .
thank you .
so what &apos;s with you ?
what ?
that was an amazing moment ,
and you just sat there like y @-@ you didn &apos;t even care .
i &apos;m just tired .
look , i know this has been a shock ,
and i &apos;m trying to give you time , but it &apos;s been three months .
when are you gonna start
getting excited about our kids ?
what ?
i don &apos;t love them .
lynette .
please . don &apos;t look at me that way .
if i can &apos;t talk to you about this , then i am in big trouble .
you &apos;re just upset because ... this wasn &apos;t planned .
none of them were planned ,
but i loved each of our kids
the moment i knew they were coming .
it &apos;s different this time .
i don &apos;t love these babies .
stop saying that .
when you hold them in your arms ,
you will care about these kids .
just as much as the others .
okay .
the wedding
i think i left something in the car . i &apos;ll see you inside .
bree .
orson will drink too much today ,
like he always does at weddings .
he &apos;ll be asleep by 9 : 00 .
meet me at the shangrila motel at 9 : 30 .
and you won &apos;t bail on me again ?
i booked the room last night .
i &apos;ve already changed the sheets and cleaned the bathroom .
kiss me .
what happened to the good girl ?
she decided guilt &apos;s a small price to pay for happiness .
frankly , i think it looked better on me .
katherine .
what are you doing here ?
you may have noticed that i &apos;ve been out of sorts lately ,
and i just couldn &apos;t understand why .
i mean , sure , i was dumped by the love of my life ,
but it was more than that .
and then it hit me . my friend--
who was sort of responsible for my world imploding--
never bothered to cross the street to see how i was doing .
didn &apos;t have the ... decency to apologize .
i am very , very--
no , not here. out there .
in the hallway ?
in your ceremony .
everybody in town knows you humiliated me .
i think i deserve a public apology .
in the middle of my wedding ?
i found the perfect spot , right here .
after the reading of ecclesiastes . and right before
&quot; we &apos;ve only just begun . &quot;
i am not doing that .
yes , you will ,
or i will create a scene so ugly
your guests will still be talking about it
on your golden anniversary .
okay .
but i am not happy about this .
aw. try to smile anyway .
nobody likes a grumpy bride .
why don &apos;t we just get this over with ?
would you mind getting my gloves ?
they &apos;re in the garment bag .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just until after the ceremony .
susan !
and from this day forward ,
you shall be each other &apos;s home .
you shall be each other &apos;s sanctuary .
susan , let me out !
with this ring ,

and if you don &apos;t , so help me god ,
i will drag you out of this church myself .
i &apos;m sorry. i ...
i @-@ i just wanted ...
i &apos;ll go .
katherine , wait .
hello , everybody .
i just wanna say something .
oh , we don &apos;t need this on the veo .
when mike asked me to marry him ... again ,
it was one of the happiest days of my life .
but for someone else ,
it was the day her whole world fell apart .
and i have to admit , i ...
i didn &apos;t care .
in that moment , i was a selfish person ,
and i chose my happiness .
but i want you all to know
that i am truly sorry for changing her path .
and i hope
that katherine mayfair finds happiness
and can find it in her heart to forgive me ...
and be my friend again .
i hope that helped .
honestly ...
it didn &apos;t .
where the hell is danny ?
he left the wedding two hours ago and he &apos;s not in his room .
he &apos;ll be home soon .
you know , what has gotten into that kid ?
he &apos;s staying out late , pickin &apos; fights with girls in public .
he knows better than that .
he &apos;s a teenager .
well , go look for him .
we can &apos;t afford to make waves here .
everyone has to think we are nice , normal people .
yeah .
it &apos;s not hard to find sin in the suburbs .
just look behind closed doors ,
and you &apos;ll find your neighbors
cheating on their husbands ....
maternity clothes
resenting their children ...
plotting against their friends .
but as much as we like to talk about
the sinful things people do ...
we forget there is a difference between sin ... and evil .
sadly , there &apos;s always someone willing to come along
