Torez to Command!
Torez to Command!
I've got trespassers down by the site!
I repeat
trespassers down by the site! I'm in pursuit!
Help me. Help me!
I think I broke my leg.
Please, I-I need a hospital.
Ah, no! No, please!
Where is she? I don't see her.
She said she's gonna text
right when she lands,
so I'm waiting for the text, you see?
What?
Nothing.
What do you mean, "Nothing"?
Do I look like a goof? Is this too much?
Maybe a little bit.
A little bit?
You should have said something in the car.
Look, Gabby's been gone nine months-- I figure
I'd do something nice but I look like an idiot.
It's too much. You're right.
Hello. Welcome to Hawaii. Got you some flowers.
Aloha.
Thanks.
Aloha. Thank you. That's right.
Some balloons for you, sir. Enjoy.
Oh, thanks, dude.
Chocolates for you.
Welcome to Hawaii.
Mahalo.
Thank you. I feel better now.
All right, this is her. This is her.
And, um...
What is it?
It's a...
change of plans, monkey. She's not coming.
Why not?
Because, uh, she got more work
to do in Morocco, I guess.
I'm sorry, Danno.
You're what? You're sorry? What do you mean, you're sorry?
Listen, I got you, so I don't need anything else.
I got the prettiest lady in Hawaii, all right?
Come here.
Welcome to paradise, huh?
Is that her?
No, it's work, monkey. Come on.
She give you a reason?
A reason why she's staying in Morocco
or why she stood me up at the airport?
Either.
She got offered a fellowship,
she decided to take it.
I guess she didn't want to hurt my feelings.
I mean, I-I-I sort of thought that
we had something nice going,
but if I cannot compete with sandstorms and artifacts,
I guess it was time to reevaluate anyway, right?
So the victim's name is Chad Torez.
He's a security guard with Kalaunu Construction.
They're out here doing a geological survey
in connection with the light rail.
According to a supervisor,
Torez was out on patrol last night
when he radioed in a report about some trespassers.
Based on some footprints,
it looks like he was chasing them down,
he fell into the hole,
and the suspects circled back and shot him.
HPD just found some fresh tire tracks
about a hundred yards over.
They're getting casts. But it's weird.
I spoke to the foreman and he said
these holes weren't here a couple of days ago.
In fact, his crew hadn't actually started working yet.
I'm guessing that
the holes didn't dig themselves.
Could've been our perps.
I think I might know what they were looking for.
What is that?
Given the absence of a middle phalange,
I believe it's a skeletal remain of a human thumb.
Wait a minute. There's another body in this hole?
That is correct.
Although, clearly it's been removed.
Okay, well, if this was a a grave...
what about all these other holes?
There were 11 holes-- each one appears
to have contained one body.
My chemical analysis of the decomposition fluids
within the soil suggest
the bodies have been in there from anytime between
six months to 18 years.
All right, so somebody's been using this field
as their own personal graveyard going on two decades.
Assuming it's our suspects,
I'm guessing they heard about the light rail coming through,
figured they better move these bodies
before a construction team dug 'em up, right?
What about IDs?
Let's start with Jim Henley.
He was a longshoreman
who went missing seven years ago.
I dug a little deeper, though, and it turns out
he was also a confidential informant.
Informing on who?
The Yakuza.
Then there's also Ken Nagoya, Stacy Ford,
both of whom were eyewitnesses in separate homicide cases
against two Yakuza members.
Both of them disappeared
before they were able to testify.
Still waiting for IDs on the rest,
but at this point, I'd say it's a safe bet that
they were all on a Yakuza hit list.
So this field was a body dump.
There've been rumors for years
that the Yakuza had one somewhere on the island.
Looks like we found it.
Cath, what's going on?
Hey, um, do you have a moment?
Yeah, sure. Give me a sec, will you, guys?
All right.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine.
Um, listen, do you remember Kevin Hobbs
from the Naval Academy?
Yeah. Linebacker for the Mids.
What about him?
Well, he's with the FBI now.
He gave me a ring earlier 'cause he knows
that I have a direct line to you.
Okay.
And, um...
Catherine, what's wrong? What?
Listen, Steve, he told me something
off the record that I think you really need to know.
All right, we need a list of all
known Yakuza on the island.
All right, I'll talk to the FBI.
Kono, maybe you should talk to Adam,
see if he knows anything about this field.
Yeah, of course.
Hey, uh, Danny, I gotta take care of something.
Just call me if you get any traction on the case, all right?
Whoa, whoa, ho. What was that?
You left a smoke trail.
It's nothing.
Oh, it's nothing.
Are we gonna do that game now?
Listen, Danny, it's probably better
if you don't know this one.
No, see, this is where I strongly disagree.
Okay, would you stop, please? Stop.
Last month the FBI's Computer Forensics Unit caught somebody
hacking into the National Fingerprint Database.
Now, it took them some time,
but they think they finally have a suspect.
So what? Why are you acting goofy because of that?
Because the suspect is my mother.
Okay, apparently she covered her tracks pretty well,
but now the Feds have been able to trace
an IP back to a Wi-Fi hotspot
and they can place Doris there around the time of the hack.
Okay, do you have any idea why she's doing this?
I have no idea.
All I know is the Feds are closing in.
I gotta go see her right now.
Hey, honey, what are you doing here?
We need to talk.
Really? 'Cause I was just on my way out.
Oh, yeah?
Some place that has free Wi-Fi maybe?
Because if you're planning on hacking into
another highly secured government database,
you should try to make sure
you don't get caught on camera.
You got nothing to say?
Okay, for what it's worth, I did the FBI a favor.
I identified their weak spots.
Mom, do you have any idea how serious this is?
You're looking at jail time here.
Oh, come on. This is circumstantial. It's nothing.
Can you hear yourself right now?
Okay, at least let me explain.
This should be good.
Over coffee. Come on. Let's just sit down
and talk this through, please?
Can we go?
What was that? Somebody's here?
No one's here. Can we just...?
Who is here?
I have to go.
Steve, just wait, Steve!
Commander.
Steve.
What the hell is going on?
Okay, no more lies, no more games.
Just tell me what's going on.
Okay.
I was looking into who stole the microfiche,
and Mick and Wade have been helping.
That's why you hacked the FBI?
Yeah, I pulled a print from the break-in.
I needed an ID, and I... I didn't want
to get you involved.
Okay, who's your suspect?
Give me a name.
I'll have 'em picked up in ten minutes.
You can't.
And why is that?
Because they still have the microfiche.
You move in now, you'll blow any chance I have
of stealing it back.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
What happened to you, mom?
What happened to the woman who used to make fried baloney sandwiches
and was on the PTA
and who showed me how to paddle an outrigger,
and used to teach me magic tricks?
I mean, where'd you go?!
You think I want to be doing this?
Honey, I'm trying to start over,
but I can't until I know we're safe.
You know without that microfiche we're vulnerable.
I have to get it back. I will get it back.
I think you're right.
What's going on?
Three more IDs came back.
I followed up on all three cases
and it turns out that
Michael Noshimuri was a suspect in two of them.
Was he in charged?
No. Um,
he was questioned, but because they never found a body,
nothing ever stuck.
So, listen, um, I think that 'cause of your relationship
with Adam, you should probably sit this one out.
Chin and I will talk to Michael
and we'll also talk to Adam if we have to.
Okay.
Michael Noshimuri.
Detective Williams, Chin Ho Kelly.
We got to talk to you.
I'll be with you in a minute.
Not gonna help the guy up?
Chin Ho Kelly?
My brother's tapping your cousin, right?
Guess that makes us practically related, right?
You better watch your mouth.
So what can I do for you boys?
You just come here to watch me sweat?
Oh, no, no, no, no, we, uh...
we want to ask you a couple questions.
You, um, recognize these guys?
Hey, right here, pay attention.
You recognize these guys?
No.
No?
You know, why don't you take another look?
We know you were questioned by HPD
when both of them disappeared.
Oh, yeah.
It's all coming back to me now.
I was wrongfully accused and I was cleared.
No, no, no, no, you weren't, you weren't cleared.
They never found a body so we couldn't press charges.
Is that why you're here, because you found the bodies?
You know we didn't find no bodies.
No, what we found was that last night two guys
dug them up, so that they would never be discovered.
And this relates to me how?
I'm gonna get to that, uh...
Where were you last night?
Seriously?
Yeah, seriously.
I was at home.
Anybody who can vouch for that?
555-0198.
Leo Bates.
Who is that?
Oh, wait, let me guess.
That's a number of your ex-con buddy who's gonna say
he was with you even if he wasn't, right?
No, that's my lawyer.
You got any more questions, ask him.
We're done here.
All right, uh, we'll make it simple.
We know that you're involved in this, okay?
You should say hi to Kono for me.
And if you got any more cousins like that,
you should send them my way.
Oh, no, no, no, go easy.
I'm right here.
Okay, you're right here, everybody's right here,
we're all right here.
All right, listen to me.
Uh, you ever disrespect my friend like that again,
I'm gonna let him come back here and bust
your pretty face up, okay?
The prints I ran through the FBI database belong to this man.
James Austin.
He's ex-military, dishonorably discharged.
What's his interest with the microfiche?
No interest.
He was just a hired gun.
Hired by who?
Tyler Cain.
We were at the CIA together.
After that he opened a private military company,
supplying mercs to every dictator with a checkbook.
But now he's about to be appointed
Director of National Intelligence,
which requires senate confirmation.
Okay, so let me guess.
While Cain was with the agency,
he did some things that the senate wouldn't approve of,
and the only real evidence of that is in the microfiche.
Exactly.
It begs a question.
Why doesn't he destroy the microfiche?
Why's he holding on to it?
Same reason Doris held onto it for so many years.
Leverage.
A lot of ex-operatives could get burned by what's on there.
Cain could use that to his advantage.
All right, you said you know where it is.
First Honolulu Tower.
Cain keeps it in a safe in his office on the 16th floor.
But getting it back won't be easy.
The building is highly secure.
There are at least ten armed guards stationed
inside around the clock.
Aloha. Here to check your fire extinguishers.
There are cameras...
at every entrance.
Okay, there you go, sir.
Thank you.
In every hallway.
And every stairwell.
And every elevator.
And then there's the key cards.
There's not a single door or entrance
in the entire building that doesn't require one.
No, no.
No, no, I don't want you to sell for less than one point four.
Yeah, if you talked to them, that would be the...
Oh, I am, I am so...
terribly sorry.
That was entirely my fault.
That's quite all right.
Please forgive me.
I was on a long-distance call to Europe and I...
My name is Heidi.
Heidi. Listen, Heidi, here you go.
Oh, thank you.
Uh, could I take you to lunch?
Yeah, that would be great actually.
Thank you.
Geez, flirt much?
I only have eyes for you, darling.
Okay, what about the safe?
Well, that was a little harder.
Uh, the safe is voice-activated.
But with time and patience,
we were able to record Cain's voice
and cobble together his pass-phrase.
Honey,
I'm telling you, we've got this so covered.
Look, you guys have done your homework,
all right, but once you're inside
something's gonna happen that you didn't plan on.
Okay, you know that.
And one mistake with this
level of security could be deadly.
I'm sorry, but this isn't a mission.
It's a suicide pact.
Oh, please.
Was he always this negative?
He doesn't get it from me.
This is crazy.
You know what people your age are doing?
They're not planning covert ops, okay?
They-they're in book clubs.
You know what they do at nighttime?
Book club?
They play bridge at night.
And besides, you two,
you should not be enabling her.
Thank you for your input, Steven,
but this is happening.
You want to stop us-- arrest us.
Otherwise we're going in, tonight.
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry if I scared you.
There was a crisis and I had to go
to Japan at the last minute.
Right.
So, how did it go?
Should be okay.
But it's just business.
I'm sure you don't want to hear about it.
You met with Riku Sato.
Why wouldn't I want to hear about that?
What are you...?
You were spying on me?
No, Adam, I was worried about you.
I hadn't heard from you in days.
So I came here and you were gone.
And then two Yakuza showed up.
What did they want?
They didn't say, but they were armed.
Adam, would you tell me what's going on?
Why are you being so secretive?
And why are you meeting with a man like Sato?
What's going on is...
I'm trying to cut my family's last ties to the Yakuza.
Really? 'Cause that's not what it looks like.
I know, believe me, I know how this looks.
And I don't blame you for being suspicious, but...
I can't talk about it, okay?
Adam...
You're just, you're just gonna have to trust me!
You want me to trust you?
You're gonna have to give me something.
Okay.
What?
What do you know about a field off of H2
where the Yakuza's been hiding bodies?
Nothing. Why?
You know nothing about someone digging it up?
No, I've never even heard of this place.
What's this about?
Adam, just look me in the eye and tell me
what you know about it.
I know nothing about it.
I swear.
You believe me, right?
Yeah.
Yeah?
It's Adam, we need to talk.
What's the problem?
I just got a visit from Five-O.
Two hours.
I'll call you with a location.
Hey, Fong, uh, it's Kono.
Remember that, uh, that phone you helped me clone?
It just made an outgoing call.
I need you to ping that number right away.
Thank you.
Five-O, drop your weapons.
Hands in the air.
Don't even think about it.
Drop the weapon.
10-15. Officer down.
10-15...
Chin? - Hey.
How's Kono?
She's gonna be okay.
No vital organs were hit.
But when she gets back on her feet,
I'm gonna kill her.
What were you thinking?
I'm sorry, Steve.
You're s...?
What were you doing going in here without any back up?
I was running down a lead.
What lead? Where'd you get a lead from?
I got it from Adam.
Kono...
Sorry, Commander,
we're gonna have to take her to the hospital now.
All right, I'll go with her, then head back to HQ.
You all right?
I'll be good.
Good.
All right, so HPD ID'd the two guys
that shot it out with Kono as Yakuza hit men.
Okay, what else we got?
Both had nine millimeters, same caliber as the shell casings
we found at the body dump.
And out the back, we got tire tracks
that might be a match as well.
So these were the same guys
who killed Chad Torez.
Check this out.
And here are our missing vics.
I'm thinking the barrels of sand...
they were waiting for the sun to go down
so they could dump the bodies in the ocean.
Right, but these guys are still just foot soldiers.
They're taking orders from somebody else.
Yeah, Michael Noshimuri.
We will get him. Maybe not today, but we'll get him.
Hey, Max.
Afternoon, Commander. Detective.
Uh, please forgive me for being rude,
but perhaps we can skip our customary repartee?
As you can see, I have quite a bit of work to do.
Yeah, we'll get out of your way.
Good luck.
Yeah?
What, uh... what's going on with Doris?
It's not good.
It turns out she lied to me about more than
just hacking into the FBI database.
Ah. You more upset about that, or...
the fact that she's in trouble?
Look, look, all right, look, it's none of my business.
All right?
But whatever she did... so what? Right?
She's your mother,
and she's in trouble, you gotta help her.
Right?
If you're going to try to talk me out of going again,
you can just leave.
I'm not.
I'm going with you.
No. No, honey there is no way I'm gonna let you do this.
Mom, somebody's got to watch your back.
This guy Cain isn't somebody you want to mess with.
I've got Mick and Wade, I'll be fine.
Listen...
Three retirees launching a covert op?
How do you think that's gonna go down?
No. No, no, you can't risk it.
Steve, you've got too much to lose.
Your job, your whole life here. No.
Just listen to me.
Forget all that, okay?
I lost you once before.
I'm not gonna lose you again.
I'm going with you.
Night, Mr. Cain.
Cain just left for the evening.
I'm going in.
Rope, rope, rope.
Go, go, go!
Okay, McGarretts, the elevators are mine.
You're good to go.
Eat up, sistah.
Most people don't know this,
but shrimp got healing power.
It's a super-food.
Shrimp is the new "Motzo" ball soup.
It's "Matzo." Matzo ball.
Whatever.
Okay, well, healthy or not,
it's still way better than the hospital food, so thanks.
So what's, uh, going on with our case?
Well, Max is processing the remains you found.
Hopefully, he pulls some slugs that we can match ballistics to.
But right now
the only thing you need to worry about is getting healthy.
Well, I appreciate the concern, cuz,
but I'm gonna be okay.
The doctor said I was lucky, and, um,
I should be able to get out of here in a few days.
And if you do, it's because of the shrimp.
Yeah, most likely. Um...
We're gonna let you get some rest and we'll see you later.
Let's get out of here.
All right. Thanks for coming by.
All right. See you soon.
Okay.
I hope this wasn't some attempt to get out of dinner with me.
Adam... how did you, uh...
Chin Ho called.
He told me what happened.
Kono... I'm sorry.
I feel like this is all my fault.
What are you talking about?
I need to tell you something.
After you came to see me,
I called some people.
I was trying to find out about that field you mentioned.
You see... I think Michael's involved.
I should've told you.
Maybe if I had...
you would've held off, and...
I thought I was protecting you, but I was wrong.
I was wrong,
and I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Hey, it's okay.
What is it?
Adam, there's something I have to tell you.
Excuse me.
It's time for your CT scan.
Don't leave, okay?
I'll be right back.
All right. I'm not going anywhere.
We need to talk.
Okay.
Mom, you all right?
Yeah, I'm good.
Hey, Mick,
we're at Cain's floor.
We clear?
Hold up.
The guards are watching their monitors. Stand by.
I want you to watch very carefully.
What are you doing?
Come on, are you watching?
No. Mom, no.
Come on... Just watch.
Just... Mom, please. I'm not nine anymore.
You're never too old for magic.
Just watch carefully.
One trick, okay?
Okay? Ready?
Watching?
Ready? Blow.
I'm not gonna blow.
Magic... magic breath.
I'm not gonna blow magic breath.
You're gonna breath.
How'd you do... how'd you do that?
What's this? What's this?
Mick.
We've got an elevator coming up the shaft.
I know, I know.
Mick.
Mick, can we move into the hallway?
Negative-- I've still got one guard at the desk.
Mick, do something!
I'm trying, I'm trying.
Okay, you're all clear.
Go, go, go.
OK.
Come on, let's go.
My name is Tyler Cain.
This is my voice.
Verify me.
Is that it?
Yeah, let's get out of here.
What the hell is that?
Must've triggered a hidden sensor. Let's go.
Mick, kill all camera feeds to the guard's desk.
On it. Wade, how's our exit?
Blown-- two guards with automatic weapons on the roof.
Hey you, stop!
Mick, what's happening? Mick?
You've got guards on 9, 11 and 14.
Get to the 12th floor.
There's a window washer platform
outside the northeast corner office.
Go!
We're not gonna make it.
You're right, go.
I'm gonna cover you.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna cover you. Go, go.
Steve!
Mick!
Mick, I need another way out of here.
OK. Freight elevator, kid.
I'll drop you on three.
There's an outdoor plaza.
The stairs will lead right down to street level.
Freeze!
Got one of them...
Stop! Freeze!
Freeze!
Hold it right where you are.
Steve, we got a problem.
Hands in the air.
It's your mom.
Mick?
What's happening?
They got her, Steve.
Mick?
Mick, where are you?
Outside.
Sorry, kid, I had to bail.
They were moving in.
Any idea where they're holding her?
No, but Cain just got back.
He's heading in now-- you got to get out of there.
Nah, I can't do that, Mick.
Steve, listen to me.
Doris made it very clear.
The op gets blown, we walk.
Hey, she's my mother, all right?
I'm not leaving her.
Doris McGarrett.
Been a long time.
Not long enough.
Somewhat disappointing.
The Doris McGarrett I knew wouldn't have screwed up
an op this bad.
You're looking a little rough around the edges yourself, Tyler.
I didn't find the microfiche,
but she did have this, Mr. Cain.
Well, whoever you are, I know you can hear me.
It seems that we each have something that the other wants.
So let's keep it simple.
Let's say five minutes, my office.
One second over, she dies.
Mick, Mick.
You give them that microfiche,
you are both dead.
How do you want to play it?
All right, go check it out.
Drop your weapon.
What are you gonna do?
Put it down!
All right, all right, easy, easy.
Now, let's just take it easy there.
Yeah, I was gonna call the police
but I see they've already arrived.
It's Commander McGarrett, isn't it?
Head of Five-O?
Put it down.
Geez, Doris, you involved your son in this?
It was my choice.
He never listens to his mother.
Well, I don't know what your game is here, kid,
but you got three seconds
to produce the microfiche.
Open it.
Unroll it, please.
Now hand it over.
You hand my mother over.
Okay, let's try this again.
You hand it over, I let her go.
Don't trust him, Steve.
What are you gonna do, hmm?
You gonna watch her die, son?
I think you're out of moves.
No, you're wrong.
You didn't want anybody to see what was on there anyway, right?
Now nobody ever will.
Congratulations, sir.
You're gonna get your senate confirmation,
and you're gonna get your big job.
But that's all you're gonna get.
The thing is, Mr. Cain,
people know we're here.
People know we're here,
and if we don't walk out of here,
they're gonna know what happened.
And you're going to get nothing.
It's your call.
All right, go.
Get the hell out of here.
Before I change my mind.
Come on, let's go.
Go on!
Let's go.
Wade, ready for pickup in 60 seconds.
Copy that.
You okay?
Do you realize what you just did?
Wha...?
You see that?
All those magic tricks you showed me as a kid--
you thought I wasn't paying attention.
You're welcome.
Son, let's go home.
You know, I never figured you the type to geek out on magic.
You of all people...
well, I guess at the end of the day it makes sense, you know?
Magic and secrets, they go together.
What's your point?
No, no, no, no point.
I just, uh, makes me wonder
what-what else I don't know about you.
It's Gabby.
Take the call, answer it.
You don't want to talk to her?
No, she probably just wants to, uh, apologize again
about how poorly she treated me, about her bad behavior.
Bad behavior?
You're just gonna punish her?
Hey, Max, what's up?
What's up, buddy?
Um, last night I pulled a slug
out of one of the bodies recovered from the warehouse.
I sent it off to ballistics and
20 minutes ago it got a hit.
Okay.
