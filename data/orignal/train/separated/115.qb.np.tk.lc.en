第六季 第十四集
son of a bitch !
we &apos;re being evicted .
how is that even possible ?
&quot; if the leaseholder is unable &quot; to be physically on the premises ,
&quot; said obligation may be fulfilled by his or her proxy . &quot;
say hello to his or her proxy .
we can &apos;t coordinate ,
but you can get to me through my associate .
about what ?
your pac .
the pac that i set up in support of you .
cough suppressant , nasal spray ,
decongestant , vitamin c.
if you don &apos;t like cherry flavor , there &apos;s orange .
let &apos;s see .
here . oh , no , wait , that &apos;s tropical .
i &apos;ll go back and get orange .
i don &apos;t have a cold . you know that .
yeah , but it &apos;s prophylactic .
okay , how we doing ?
let &apos;s hear the voice .
i &apos;m alicia florrick ,
and i &apos;d like your endorsement .
it &apos;s not that bad .
it &apos;s kind of cute , actually .
i called them .
they still want to do the interview today .
good . i &apos;m fine .
okay , i &apos;ll be back to pick you up in three hours
and take you over there . rest your voice .
is , um , prady &apos;s interview online ?
yes , and don &apos;t worry about it .
which means i should worry about it .
no . stop talking .
just listen .
do you want me to make you some tea ?
i &apos;ll make you some tea .
no , no , i &apos;m fine . guys .
i just have been giving too many speeches .
look , we &apos;re entering the home stretch .
we &apos;re a week away from election day ,
and you and prady are neck and neck .
so this interview today , it &apos;s everything .
you have a great bedside manner .
&quot; don &apos;t worry about it , but if you screw this up , everyone will die . &quot;
if you get the editorial board &apos;s endorsement ,
traditionally speaking , that &apos;s two points in the polls .
now , you need it and he needs it .
so whoever gets it wins ,
you understand ? don &apos;t talk .
she understands .
here &apos;s the thing . it &apos;s a conservative paper .
it &apos;s an old democratic machine .
that works in your favor . they like peter .
so sell them on the whole stand @-@ by @-@ your @-@ man stuff
and be tough on crime .
are they gonna ask about zach ?
about the abortion ?
they might . if they do ,
just give them the angry mom thing .
my angry mom thing ?
don &apos;t talk .
just nod .
we &apos;re leaving now .
rest your voice , don &apos;t take any calls .
matter of fact , let me take that .
i &apos;m fine .
no , you &apos;re not . i &apos;m turning it off .
rest your voice . stay here for the next three hours .
don &apos;t think about anything else . i will be back to pick you up .
marissa , it &apos;s time to leave .
call me if you need anything . you &apos;ll be great .
and don &apos;t take the nighttime stuff
before the interview or you &apos;ll be loopy .
i don &apos;t have a cold .
we &apos;re going now .
thank you for doing this , mr. prady .
thank you for having me .
i @-@ i , it &apos;s a , it &apos;s good to finally get down
to the substance of this campaign .
actually , who had a lot to do with my thinking about the ,
uh , the s.a. office was alicia florrick .
that you &apos;ll have to explain .
my campaign manager is not gonna be happy .
uh , i &apos;m supposed to say &quot; opponent , &quot;
not her name , but , uh ,
somehow i think you won &apos;t be tricked by that .
we might be .
well , alicia thinks the problems
with the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office are small .
better management , more expertise .
i believe they are large issues .
a racist infrastructure ,
a militari ...
frank prady said
you believe the issues in the s.a. &apos; s office
are small and manageable . is that true ?
well , even manageable issues aren &apos;t small .
they do need to be managed .
and the good thing about manageable issues
is that i can be held accountable .
if i don &apos;t bring in more hate crime prosecutions
in my first hundred days ,
fire me .
what does that even mean , &quot; fire you &quot; ?
how can they fire you ? you &apos;re already in office .
it &apos;s not about practicality , it &apos;s about sounding good .
i know it makes good copy if i criticize my opponent ,
but i won &apos;t do it .
okay . how about her husband ?
how much time do we have ?
no , no , no .
you &apos;re not as funny or as likable as mr. prady ,
are you , mrs. florrick ?
well , i think i &apos;m likable .
but more importantly , i &apos;m passionate .
that makes it sound like you &apos;re acknowledging you &apos;re not likable .
no , she &apos;s trying to turn a negative into a positive .
are you acknowledging you &apos;re not funny or likable ?
no , i &apos;m just saying that likability
is not a key component to the job .
frank prady has been a reporter for the last five ...
we said we wouldn &apos;t smear each other .
likability is not a key component to the job .
i &apos;ve spent the last five years working full @-@ time as a lawyer .
i haven &apos;t had time to finesse my onscreen presence .
good , elegant .
don &apos;t forget ,
it &apos;s a conservative newspaper .
so , let &apos;s turn to your home life .
how about your son , zach ?
did he get an abortion with his 15 @-@ year @-@ old girlfriend ?
why do you still freeze up at that ?
it &apos;s a question you &apos;ll be asked .
she &apos;s not still freezing up at it .
this is the first time she &apos;s been asked it .
it &apos;s not even the first time she &apos;s been asked it ,
because we &apos;re just in her imagination thinking about ...
i &apos;m fine , mom .
you don &apos;t have to worry about me .
hello , mr. canning .
alicia ?
you okay ? you sound sick .
no , i &apos;m just resting my voice .
okay , good .
well , i &apos;ll do all the talking .
i @-@ i want to settle this lawsuit between us .
i @-@ i &apos;m not well ,
and @-@ and i don &apos;t want to leave this earth
with this hanging over our heads .
mr. canning , you &apos;ve been leaving this earth
for three months now .
so excuse my incredulity .
i &apos;m suing your firm for wrongful eviction .
it &apos;s a $ 12 million suit ,
but for old times &apos; sake , alicia ,
i &apos;m willing to settle for $ 4 million .
really ? so that &apos;ll only cost me
$ 500,000 out of pocket ?
well , it &apos;s better than $ 2 million out of pocket .
it &apos;s a nuisance suit , mr. canning .
you were evicted ; get over it .
i was wrongfully evicted ,
and i just don &apos;t think you want to be in depositions
during your last week of the campaign .
you won &apos;t look good being deposed
by a deathly ill man .
you &apos;re amazing , mr. canning .
you &apos;re supposedly in the last few weeks of your life ,
and you would rather be battling me
than home with your family .
i can do both .
call me by 6 : 00 p.m. today with your counteroffer ,
or i &apos;ll see you in depositions tomorrow .
depositions that won &apos;t look good in the press .
you don &apos;t have a case , mr. canning .
come on , alicia .
you &apos;re a chess player .
think it through .
this one i &apos;ll win .
this office was mine to sublet to whomever i wanted .
i chose to evict mr. canning and his firm
so that i could occupy it myself .
diane was no longer a tenant in the building .
it was illegal for her to evict our firm .
it &apos;s true i wasn &apos;t a tenant ,
but my proxy was .
howard lyman had office space .
yes , but howard lyman was hired for fraudulent reasons
explicitly to @-@ to evict me .
and that &apos;s a wrongful eviction .
howard lyman was not diane &apos;s proxy
because at the time of the eviction ,
she had no signed agreement with him .
october 18 .
that was the day howard signed his partnership agreement .
two weeks after i was evicted .
howard could not have been diane &apos;s proxy
because at the time , he was still a partner of mine .
霍华德 · 莱曼不是合伙人
good morning , everyone .
how are we doing ?
ooh , bagels .
i didn &apos;t need a written contract .
i had an oral agreement with diane .
that &apos;s how i became her proxy .
queen takes your bishop , mr. canning .
not really .
但是我们有霍华德
what were the particulars
of your oral agreement , mr. lyman ?
um ... what ?
what were the particulars of your oral agreement
with diane lockhart ?
you know , that i become a partner .
you understand
that an oral agreement isn &apos;t valid
unless both parties understand the terms .
so , did you understand the terms ?
sure .
and what were they ?
rook to queen four .
hi , i &apos;m david lee , family law .
you used to work as mr. canning &apos;s partner ,
didn &apos;t you , mr. lee ?
yes . hello , mr. canning .
hi .
and now ,
you work for florrick , agos &amp; lockhart .
yes .
and once mr. lyman came to you and canning
and told you he was leaving ,
did you try to outbid for his services ?
we did .
in other words ,
you understood his oral agreement to be genuine .
we did .
that &apos;s all we need .
howard doesn &apos;t need to understand the particulars
of his contract .
you did .
mr. canning , hello .
i have an answer for you now
on your suit , if you want .
well , now you &apos;re sounding confident , alicia .
you were right to tell me to game it through .
because ...
yes ?
i &apos;m gonna call you back .
uh , mr. canning .
i have to deal with something here .
oh , absolutely . take your time , alicia .
i @-@ i want you to be perfectly comfortable
with your decision .
hello ?
yeah . i think we have a problem
with our wrongful eviction suit .
yeah , what &apos;s that ?
are all the partners on the hook
if we pay canning ?
yeah .
even david lee ?
no .
he joined the partnership afterwards .
you think there &apos;s a problem there ?
yes .
can you find out if david lee
has been in touch with canning ?
sure .
are you okay ? you sound like you have a cold .
it &apos;s just laryngitis .
oh , that &apos;s my call waiting .
can you get back to me in the next hour or so ?
sure .
hello .
it &apos;s me . w @-@ why is your phone on ?
why are you calling me ?
uh ... we have a problem .
uh , there &apos;s this blog called court scene .
and they &apos;re reporting something
that may end up in your interview .
and you need to answer it .
about zach ?
no . about bishop .
apparently there &apos;s a wiretap
where he &apos;s supposedly saying ,
&quot; don &apos;t worry about getting arrested .
i just bought the next state &apos;s attorney . &quot;
did you hear what i said ?
i did .
alicia , this is ... devastating .
you said &quot; supposedly saying &quot; there was a wiretap .
was there or not ?
well , it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s real ; the rumor is the reality .
you need to respond .
how can i answer if i don &apos;t know
if it &apos;s true or not ?
i &apos;ll work up a response .
you just turn your phone off and focus , okay ?
yeah , this is really helping .
mrs. florrick
are you in league with lemond bishop ,
the top drug dealer in town ?
damn .
don &apos;t worry about an arrest .
i just bought the next state &apos;s attorney .
don &apos;t worry about an arrest .
i just bought the next state &apos;s attorney .
although i guess she won &apos;t be in office for six months .
don &apos;t worry about an arrest .
i just bought the next state &apos;s attorney .
although i guess she won &apos;t be in office for six months .
you know what ?
she might lose to her opponent .
you want me to respond to a rumor of a wiretap ?
yes .
it doesn &apos;t even make sense .
i &apos;m neck and neck with prady .
even if i do win ,
i won &apos;t take office for another six months .
you &apos;re acknowledging the premise of the question !
only because it &apos;s a stupid question .
no , it &apos;s not . it &apos;s a likely question .
hello .
you &apos;re right . there are 22 calls
between david lee and canning over the last week .
that &apos;s why canning is so confident .
he &apos;s got david lee on his side .
yeah , look . i have diane and cary here , hold on .
so , you think david lee &apos;s gonna testify against us ?
i think canning &apos;s counting on it .
that &apos;s how he &apos;ll win his wrongful eviction .
do you have a cold , alicia ?
no , just laryngitis .
even if he wins on wrongful eviction ,
all he should get is what he &apos;s out on rent for the week .
right , that can &apos;t be more than $ 30,000 .
we undercut him on damages .
canning called me with an offer of $ 4 million .
why did he call you ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe he thought i would want to settle .
because of your campaign ?
yes .
are you wanting to settle ?
no . not at $ 4 million .
good , so we use the depositions to undercut the damages .
are you coming in later ?
no . i @-@ i have an interview . i &apos;ll be in tomorrow .
okay , rest your voice , alicia .
what do you want me to do ?
divest yourself of the pac .
why ?
because it &apos;s hurting me .
no . what &apos;s hurting you
is you being here in my kitchen .
what do you want me to do ?
divest yourself of alicia &apos;s pac .
why ?
because it &apos;s hurting her .
it &apos;s going to hurt her twice as much
if i pull my money now .
it &apos;ll look like a reaction to these rumors .
you want alicia to win , right ? you want ...
kalinda .
i &apos;ve been thinking about you .
and i &apos;ve been thinking about you .
we don &apos;t talk this way , and you know it .
$ 4 million is not punitive .
it &apos;s actual .
you &apos;re telling us you have $ 12 million
in actual damages from your eviction ?
yes . i lost my top client .
that &apos;s $ 12 million in annual earnings .
you didn &apos;t lose your client because we evicted you .
we were in the middle of a crucial settlement conference
and we had nowhere to meet .
oh , come on .
come on what ?
if you want me to do something ,
i could put in a statement
supporting frank prady .
excuse me ?
i could put out a statement
in support of frank prady .
what would that do ?
i didn &apos;t say on the wiretap
which state &apos;s attorney i had bought .
you want to imply it &apos;s frank prady ?
no . i just want to muddy the waters .
i had a top client who fired us
the week of our eviction .
a top client who &apos;d been with me for years .
which client is that ?
solis securities .
we can &apos;t be held
responsible for the whims of a client .
this is an affidavit from the ceo of solis
claiming it was our delay in handling the settlement conference
that led to our ouster .
mr. canning , you said you lost
your top client solis securities due to your eviction ?
that &apos;s correct .
solis securities left you and joined which firm ?
brooks , spelling &amp; myers .
a firm of equal size , equal equity
and also one without an office space .
what ?
yes .
they were going through a move of their own
at the same time as yours .
so , why would solis securities leave you
and join another firm that was homeless ?
i don &apos;t know . why would they leave ?
why would a firm that &apos;s been with me for a decade
just suddenly turn around and leave ?
i like to take a nap at lunchtime .
but my pants , they get , you know ,
so sweaty , so , uh , i remove them .
uh , just at lunchtime .
you &apos;re kidding .
and the ceo of solis
happened upon you over lunch .
yeah , but ... i explained .
think he understood .
and one week later ,
solis securities decided to leave the firm .
so , again
you have nothing to do with lemond bishop ?
that &apos;s correct .
ever since we fired him as a client .
okay , moving on .
well , you can &apos;t just leave it like that .
she &apos;s a crafty one .
you have to ask her a question with no out .
and what might that be ?
to your knowledge , mrs. florrick ,
has lemond bishop ,
the top drug dealer in chicago ,
ever contributed any money to your campaign
or pac supporting your campaign ?
first of all , i have no coordination ...
that &apos;s not the question .
it &apos;s a yes or no answer .
to your knowledge ,
has lemond bishop contributed
to your campaign or pac ?
no .
you can &apos;t tell them you &apos;re knowingly taking money
from the top drug dealer in town .
but i am knowingly taking money
from the top drug dealer in town .
no , you &apos;re not .
i am . he told me .
maybe they won &apos;t ask the question .
where is this rumor even coming from anyway ?
some stupid little web site .
what was it called ?
what do you want in a credit card ?
no rotating categories ?
no signups to earn cash rewards ?
earning unlimited 1.5 % cash back
on every purchase every day ?
返现1.5 %
zero percent intro apr on purchases
until september of 2015 ?
you &apos;ve got it .
what do you want in a credit card ?
everything .
what do you want in a credit card ?
will ?
i &apos;m not here .
it sounds like you .
marissa , have you been out here the whole time ?
it hasn &apos;t been the whole time . just half an hour .
in case you needed anything .
where you going ? out .
i need some fresh air .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
i need to focus . i can &apos;t focus in there .
i &apos;ll come with you .
no , no . i @-@ i &apos;ll be okay .
i just need ten minutes of fresh air .
it &apos;s cold out there .
i &apos;ll be okay .
are you really okay ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t know . i think .
i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll see you .
damn it .
hi , jon .
you &apos;re out walking , alicia .
marissa said you &apos;re out walking .
i just need to clear my head .
you &apos;re getting worked up about the interview .
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
no , it isn &apos;t .
i did know bishop put money in my pac .
look , here &apos;s the thing
this might not even come up in the interview .
they &apos;re gonna ask me a question
i can &apos;t answer &quot; no &quot; to .
and what is that ?
to my knowledge ,
did bishop give money to me or my pac ?
watch where you &apos;re going !
oh , my god .
what ? and why can &apos;t you answer no ?
jon ... it &apos;s true .
bishop told me directly he was giving money to my pac .
he was forming my pac .
but you don &apos;t know that he did it .
jon ... !
you &apos;re a lawyer . answer to what you know , right ?
you don &apos;t actually know that bishop gave money to your pac .
you just know that he said he would .
in fact , you can &apos;t know
that bishop gave money to your pac ,
because that would be coordinating with your pac ,
and coordinating with your pac is against the law .
oh , my god .
excuse me ? what ?
you said , &quot; oh , my god . &quot;
no ... no , i just , um ...
i just had a thought .
alicia , remember what i told you ?
no .
questions are for dopes .
oh . right .
this is one of those questions .
it &apos;s not being sophist to answer it with some ...
specificity .
okay . let me think on it .
good . go home , clear your head ,
don &apos;t think about anything else .
see you in two hours .
okay . bye .
why is it all right for you but not for me ?
will ?
alicia .
i &apos;ve missed you .
i miss you , will .
i know .
i &apos;ve been away .
just for a little while .
but i &apos;m back .
oh , god ...
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing .
everything &apos;s falling apart .
you &apos;re strong .
you &apos;ll hold it together .
you &apos;ve never ... talked like that before .
i know .
you &apos;re not really here , are you ?
主爱你 不要放弃他
不是放弃 是不信了
不是放弃 是不信了
不是放弃 是不信了
hello .
hi , grace , it &apos;s mom .
mom , where are you ?
all your stuff &apos;s on the table .
i know , i just had to get out for a minute .
um , i think i &apos;m getting your texts .
yeah , that happens when zach updates the software .
we share an account .
what text did you get ?
something from evan .
yeah ?
just ignore that .
okay .
is everything all right ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
what about with you ? you sound terrible .
no , i just have laryngitis .
okay .
i &apos;ll see you when you get back .
solis securities fired me
because my health is in decline
and , therefore , my work was not at its best .
and my inadequate performance came about
because i spent two furious weeks looking for office space .
my health was negatively impacted
by the fact that you all threw me out in the street--
a @-@ a @-@ a man dying of liver disease .
your liver failure seems to come and go whenever you need it to .
is that a question ?
yes , actually , it is .
i &apos;m appalled at you , mrs. florrick--
questioning my health .
especially with you running for office .
you &apos;re being deposed . you &apos;re under oath .
so ...
let &apos;s take this seriously .
is your liver failing ?
it &apos;s my kidney , and , yes , it &apos;s failing .
the last time i saw you , you had a kidney transplant .
what happened ?
it failed .
and how long did the doctors say you had to live ?
two months , if i &apos;m lucky .
more , if i can find another kidney .
so why are you here , spending your time , suing us ?
the same reason you &apos;re fighting with me .
i mean , it &apos;s what we do .
i don &apos;t believe you .
obviously , because you &apos;d have more compassion , if you did .
you use compassion like it &apos;s a currency , mr. canning .
don &apos;t attack me like this !
i &apos;m not attacking you !
this isn &apos;t gonna look good .
it &apos;s not me ! it &apos;s the music !
why are you still angry at me ?
you know you &apos;ll have to pay me off .
would it make you happy if i do ?
yes , it will .
why ?
you &apos;ll have lost something and i &apos;ll have won .
and that &apos;s the whole point ?
yes .
what did you think it was ?
i don &apos;t know .
i thought i did .
that &apos;s your phone .
oh , hi , alicia . it &apos;s cary and diane .
hi .
i &apos;ve given it a lot of thought .
i think we need to pay canning .
not all of it , but some of it ,
because he could use his illness to hurt us .
yeah , we thought the same thing , but ...
then something happened here .
canning canceled the depositions for tomorrow .
why ? he wants to stall .
no , he &apos;s in the hospital .
what ? !
i just talked to him an hour ago !
yeah . it just happened .
what happened ?
all we know is that he fainted .
but i think you would agree we should hold off
on any negotiations or offer ,
even if out of respect .
what hospital is he at ?
his wife was calling from harbor ,
but i don &apos;t think he &apos;s up for negotiations .
sounds pretty serious .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;ll call you back .
what difference does it make ?
i &apos;m probably in a coma or something .
you &apos;d do it for me .
what ? come to your hospital ?
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
if i was dying ?
no .
i don &apos;t believe you .
i &apos;m more consistent than you , alicia .
your husband is sleeping now , mrs. canning .
it &apos;s a touch @-@ and @-@ go situation ,
but we &apos;ll be monitoring ...
to your knowledge , mrs. florrick ,
has lemond bishop contributed money to your campaign
or pacs supporting your campaign ?
no .
you &apos;re sure ?
yes . not to my knowledge .
主爱你 不要放弃他
不是放弃 是不信了
why are you done ?
why shouldn &apos;t i be done ?
well , i don &apos;t know .
i ... i thought it mattered to you .
it did matter to me .
now it doesn &apos;t .
that happens . i thought you &apos;d be happy .
it &apos;s good news .
she &apos;s stopped believing in fairy tales .
i know .
so what &apos;s the problem ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe there is no problem .
the problem isn &apos;t language .
people rejoice when somebody finds jesus ,
even though it &apos;s false .
but we lack language for rejoicing
when someone finds the truth .
who are you again ?
richard dawkins .
renowned atheist
and the best @-@ selling author of &apos; the god delusion &apos; ?
the same .
hey , mom .
what are you doing ?
sniffing glue .
i felt a kick .
see , that &apos;s offensive .
there &apos;s no reason grace suddenly becomes pregnant
and starts sniffing glue .
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s due to loss of religion .
yes , you are .
but an atheist can act just as ethically as a christian ,
maybe even more so . we deal in the truth .
look at all those priests who raped small boys .
i &apos;m not saying christianity makes them do that ,
but it certainly doesn &apos;t seem to stop them .
there is no ethical standard without the absolute of god .
everything else slides without it .
that is just not true .
we can choose to live by the golden rule .
it honors men and women more if they choose to do right .
and not worry about some santa claus @-@ like figure
who punishes and rewards based on us doing right .
yeah , but what about zach ?
do you really want grace to turn out like zach ?
why am i being used as an example of what not to do ?
i &apos;m at georgetown .
daddy &apos;s sleeping right now ,
but he &apos;s okay .
we &apos;ll see him tomorrow .
daddy loves you both .
so what is this ? an intervention ?
no , i just wanted you to be able to discuss it with someone .
why not you ?
why not what me ?
why can &apos;t i discuss it with you ?
because i don &apos;t believe in what you do .
i know , so why can &apos;t i be more like you ?
uh , you don &apos;t want to be like your mom .
wait , why not ?
because of your interview .
you &apos;re planning to lie .
it &apos;s not lying .
why isn &apos;t it lying ?
because i can &apos;t answer the question
without coordinating with my pac .
and the other thing ... that jon said .
uh , you mean the jon you &apos;re planning to sleep with .
no .
yes .
but why is that bad ?
because you &apos;re married .
peter and i have an agreement .
you know , i am really sick of you guys
playing into this &quot; good girl &quot; thing .
making me feel guilty .
he slept with kalinda .
he slept with ramona .
he screwed hookers .
then tell the truth .
i am .
no , at your interview .
if i do that , i won &apos;t get elected .
how do you know that ?
to your knowledge , mrs. florrick ,
has lemond bishop contributed money to your campaign
or pacs supporting your campaign ?
yes .
yes , he did ?
the top drug dealer in town did ?
yes , i had no control of what he did .
bishop told me that he was financing my pac .
we &apos;re very impressed , mrs. florrick .
we &apos;re used to the canned answers of politicians ,
the casual lies ,
but you &apos;ve been very brave in here today by telling the truth .
so we &apos;re gonna give you our endorsement .
really ?
that was very brave of you , mom .
one doesn &apos;t need god to act ethically .
well , enjoy your hug .
&apos;cause that &apos;s not really how it &apos;s gonna go , and you know it .
uh @-@ oh .
what ?
buzzfeed --
&quot; is alicia florrick in league with a drug dealer ? &quot;
there &apos;s one on politico , too .
&quot; does florrick have a secret agreement with lemond bishop
to go lightly on drug arrests ? &quot;
alicia , hello .
mrs. canning , i &apos;m so sorry .
simone .
simone .
i &apos;m so sorry . how is he ?
he &apos;s , uh , not good .
they don &apos;t think he &apos;s gonna make it through the night .
oh , i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
i spoke to him earlier today--
he sounded so strong .
yeah , i know , he wanted to go to work .
thank you for coming .
you know , he has all these other lawyer friends ,
and not a single one came today .
i &apos;m sorry .
do you want to see him ?
do i ... ?
is he conscious ?
no .
no , but it &apos;ll make a difference .
he wanted me to go see you if anything went wrong .
he asked me to visit you .
that &apos;s louis .
always caring for other people .
yes .
he just looks so weak .
thank you .
i &apos;m gonna let you go , okay ?
is there anything i can do ?
anything -- food or anything .
you can pray for him .
pray for him ?
pray he lives through the night .
hypocrite .
okay .
grace , hi .
how are you ?
good . what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing , um ...
i &apos;m coming home in a minute .
can you just tell mr. elfman if he gets there
that i &apos;ll be home soon ?
okay .
and , um ...
one more thing .
what ?
can i ask you to pray for me ?
what ?
why ?
there &apos;s a friend in the hospital .
he asked me to pray for him , but i just ... i @-@ i can &apos;t .
why not ?
because i @-@ i don &apos;t believe in it .
the way you do .
is that all right ?
yeah .
how &apos;s your voice ?
good .
yeah , it sounds good .
good thing you went out .
i just made you some tea with lemon .
your mom &apos;s getting ready .
i &apos;m not trying to replace you .
what ?
i just said that , you know , in case you were worried .
you look pretty .
thanks .
was it wrong to ask you to pray ?
no , but you can , too .
but it wouldn &apos;t mean anything .
it wouldn &apos;t mean anything coming from me , either , would it ?
i promised someone i &apos;d pray for them ,
and then i realized it would be hypocritical coming from me
but not from you .
why did you promise ?
politeness ?
are you losing your faith , grace ?
no .
i don &apos;t know .
i just ...
it comes and goes .
i hope i don &apos;t influence you not to believe .
i don &apos;t want that .
i &apos;m glad you found something .
even if it &apos;s something that you don &apos;t believe ?
yes .
good luck on your interview .
do you know what you &apos;re gonna say ?
i think i do .
i love you .
that &apos;s mr. elfman .
time to go .
i &apos;ll be right there .
i &apos;m sorry .
are you ?
yes .
you &apos;ve reached zach &apos;s voice mail .
i &apos;m in class right now or sleeping it off-- leave a ...
hello ?
it doesn &apos;t make any sense to tell them
what you know about bishop .
even if it &apos;s the truth ?
well , here &apos;s the thing--
the truth isn &apos;t &quot; this happened &quot; or &quot; that happened , &quot;
the truth to me is about doing good .
and the only way to put yourself in a position to do good
is by getting elected .
that &apos;s the greater truth .
and if you don &apos;t get elected ,
somebody else is gonna take that position ,
and they &apos;re gonna do bad things with it .
how do you know that i can do better things than prady ?
because i ... have talked with you .
and been with you .
and i believe in you .
no , truth is just truth .
telling the truth , being truthful--
sometimes words have to mean what they say ,
or @-@ or else they &apos;ll just mean whatever you want .
if i tell you i won &apos;t steal your car ,
but then i steal your car
because i define &quot; steal &quot; in a different way than you do ,
then how can we all be civilized together ?
but we &apos;re not voting for a saint .
we &apos;re voting for a prosecutor .
thank you , st. alicia .
telling the truth is ...
it seems like the bare minimum for both jobs .
would you lie if you were state &apos;s attorney ?
no , i wouldn &apos;t .
then i don &apos;t think you should win .
good @-@ bye , will .
so don &apos;t say anything about bishop , okay ?
you can &apos;t coordinate with the pac .
that way you had no knowledge
of who &apos;s contributed to it and who hasn &apos;t .
okay ?
okay .
okay .
i &apos;ll be out here .
good luck .
thanks .
your voice sounds better .
i &apos;m finding it .
mrs. florrick , hello .
we &apos;re ready for you .
i &apos;m ready , too .
nice to meet you .
