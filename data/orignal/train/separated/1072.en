The Mosconi Codex.
You're gonna steal it for me.
When does it end?
You left him bleeding on the sidewalk.
I didn't kill the dude.
I pulled that badge and gun out of the trash, I swear.
Summers told us where she hid the $2 million,
but it wasn't there.
A chiropractor's office?
It'll look the part.
Agent Gruetzner. We've been expecting you.
Any reason he'd slip away to come here?
Neal always has a reason.
If this book is a puzzle,
maybe these are the pieces.
This stained glass window
could be right here in Manhattan.
This is where Neal was standing.
For 20 minutes,
after which he went straight home,
according to his anklet.
From this intersection, you could scout a museum,
two banks, and a gallery,
not to mention all the residential targets.
Peter, I made some calls.
There was no suspicious activity reported.
Not unless you count Neal Caffrey being here.
You think I'm overreacting?
No, I just think we might consider the possibility
that Caffrey was just picking up some groceries.
Long walk for a loaf of bread.
Okay.
So what was he doing there?
First, there was the missing cash,
then the FBI pen at the chiropractor's office,
and now this street corner.
So what do you think it all adds up to?
That's the problem.
I can't see how it all connects.
I'm missing something.
See if any cameras in the area picked up anything.
Will do.
Listen, I also ran the card
that you found in Siegel's badge.
Talked to the real estate company.
No one knew what "Cooper 3?" meant.
I looked through Siegel's old case files,
friends and family back in Chicago.
Hell, I even looked on Google.
No hits. Sorry.
Listen, I hate to ask you this,
but you don't think Caffrey knows anything
that he's not telling us, do you?
About Siegel?
Yeah.
I don't.
All right.
Checked black market code words,
drop locations, C.I. names.
Mozzie even tried to tie it to D.B. Cooper.
Nothing.
Maybe it's an FBI agent grasping at straws.
We both know your instincts are rarely wrong.
Well, for now, we've got a stolen shipping crate
that demands our attention.
Grabbed from Canadian customs this morning
by a fraudulent trucking company.
The driver ran. No sign of him yet.
Must be some exotic Canadian contraband
to get you out of the office.
Oh, this is well worth a stretch of my legs.
Don't tell me.
It's diamonds from the Diavik mine in the northwest territories.
Maybe it's maple syrup.
You joke, but the great canadian maple syrup heist
was worth 18 million.
You'd need a bigger crate though.
And a lot of pancakes.
Special Agent Burke. Go ahead.
It's like Christmas morning.
No, it's not a gift. This is stolen property.
I know the line gets blurry for you.
Based on the size of the box and the country of origin,
my best guess is a sculpture from Emanuel Hahn,
Canadian artist, circa 1918.
Oh, this is better than Christmas.
This is a dinosaur egg.
Even now you kind of expect it to crack open, don't you?
I really don't.
A fossilized egg doesn't capture your imagination?
Well, the value of it does.
Hello? Excuse me.
I'm Dr. Khatri.
I'm one of the curators of the Natural History Museum.
Agent Peter Burke.
You're the one who found my egg.
Well, he can't take all the credit.
And where's the mother?
What do you mean?
There was a second shipment containing the mother.
What kind of mother?
A Tyrannosaurus rex.
You're saying there's a Tyrannosaurus rex
lost somewhere in New York city?
Tyrannosaurus rex was being shipped simultaneously
on a different truck.
No sign of it anywhere.
Hunting a T-rex.
Seven-year-old me would be going crazy.
Adult you isn't exactly serene.
I can't wait to see it in person
when it's reunited with its egg.
Mozzie used to create fake fossils
and bury them at dig sites.
Used to?
It's been a couple months.
The alternate history of the earth according to Mozzie.
That's terrifying.
I'm just saying, the black market is rife
with fake fossils like this.
Do we know the egg is real?
Khatri ran an acid test and authenticated it.
Well, people with way too much money and no subtlety
do love to put them in their office
as a display of power.
Yeah, what bigger display than a T-rex and its egg?
Whoever the buyer is,
it's clear they want the entire set.
Valuable alone, invaluable together.
It's like having Queen Mary's diamond riviere
without the La Peregrina pearl.
Jones is working on a list of suspects.
I gotta get home. What are your plans tonight?
I'm just gonna relax at home.
Do a little light reading.
I'm really happy that you called.
I found something, and I brought something.
Yeah, I should've mentioned...
Agent Gruetzner will be joining us.
Hello.
A rare book expert and a wine connoisseur.
Oh, California zin.
Well, there's no shame in having one specialty.
You said you found something?
Uh... Yes.
Yes, I did.
So I was looking into the stained glass window,
and I stumbled across this.
Oh! Mosconi's grave site.
Uh, yes.
Just look down here at the bottom.
It's a masonic compass.
So he was a mason.
I should have noticed it sooner.
I mean, this is why he put the chapter 13
into the Codex.
13 is considered a sacred number for the brotherhood.
He was sending a message to the other masons.
The Codex could lead us anywhere.
I mean, masons have their hands in everything.
Finance, government, art.
Untimely death.
Look at the date on the gravestone.
April 17, 1887.
That's the same month he finished the window.
That must have been his final work.
Do you think that he was killed
because of all of this?
If that's so,
The stained glass could tell us why.
Well, thanks for everything. We'll take it from here.
Okay, I'll leave you to it.
Yes, thank you for coming over and for the wine.
Sure.
Dinner on Wednesday without the chaperone?
Of course, Agent Caffrey.
I look forward to working with you more
on all of this.
What?
I got it under control.
Well, I hate to report the obvious news,
but the last thing you are right now is under control.
Luckily, you have a guardian angel
looking over you.
This is less angel and more stalker.
I vetted her,
A cursory audit.
Financials, education, daily schedule.
She keeps a tight routine, speaks three languages,
studied two years in France.
Here, just keep it. Just in case.
T-rex and her egg were owned legally
by a man in Toronto for 50 years.
He kept it in his family room
until he died three months ago.
That's a hell of a pet to get your kids.
Big pooper scooper.
He dictated that, upon his death,
it be donated to the museum.
I'm guessing someone tried to persuade the estate
to sell it instead.
Lots of someones.
Who do we like?
Well, there's a number of people
who pursued it very aggressively.
Lots of escalating offers.
And a lot of suspicious people making them.
Anyone only try once?
Yeah, there were two single bids.
I mean, one was a lowball offer,
but then there's this guy.
He made a single high-priced offer, then nothing.
Brett Forsythe, corporate raider,
made millions from hostile takeovers.
I've heard of him.
He led a takeover of a company called Aegis last year.
That's the kind of guy
who knows when someone's not gonna sell,
and his only option is to take what he wants.
I'm gonna pay him a visit.
I'm sorry, Mr. Forsythe is unavailable at the moment.
Of course he is.
Well, if you could tell him
that Agent Burke of the FBI,
White Collar division,
would like to speak with him.
I can wait here as long as it takes.
I'm sure these guys would love to keep me company.
That's probably her boss
telling her that I can see him now.
When you took over Aegis,
the board didn't know you'd stolen their company
until you walked through the door
and fired all of them.
That was my legal right, Agent Burke.
It was.
And then you sold off pieces of the company one by one,
made a great profit.
Lost a lot of jobs.
The Feds questioned me about the Aegis takeover a month ago.
It was all aboveboard.
I know.
Why are you here?
Is that a Velociraptor skull?
Yeah.
I should sell it.
Thanks to Jurassic Park,
everyone thinks they're an expert on them.
Except the movie got everything wrong.
Velociraptors were
most likely feathered,
based on the quill knobs
found by paleontologists.
And the film made them much larger,
more like the size of a Deinonychus.
That's true.
Velociraptors were closer to the size of a chicken.
Still, one mean-looking chicken.
And very dangerous.
Are you a collector?
Oh, on a government salary?
I'd barely be able to afford an ankle joint.
How'd you get it?
There are many legal ways to purchase fossils, agent.
True.
Many illegal ways as well.
That why you're here?
To question the legality of my Velociraptor?
No, I'm hunting something bigger.
A T-rex.
Thought you said you weren't a collector.
It's not for me.
It was supposed to go to a museum
but didn't make it there.
Agent Burke, even if I stole a Tyrannosaurus rex,
which I did not,
what would I do with it?
It's not like I could just put it on display.
That's a good point.
But what a thing to have.
You think he has an actual skeleton in his closet?
I don't know what he's hiding in there,
but there was a large open space
right underneath the Raptor skull.
Well, he stalled when you got there.
That gave him time to move it.
So chances are it's illegal.
Is that what takes you so long
to come to the door when I knock?
You think I'm hiding illicit goods under my bed?
I think you're hiding something.
But I don't have enough for a warrant
to search Forsythe's office.
You should stake it out, see what happens.
Especially around 6:00 p.m.
I'll keep an eye out for anything suspicious.
You said the empty space was near the Raptor skull?
Yeah, right underneath.
It's not empty anymore.
Now there's a mean-looking club there.
Looks pre-Columbian.
Forsythe must have moved it back after I left.
As long as I'm here,
I should see what else he's hiding.
No, get the picture, and get out.
The trick with sliding locks
is they leave a smudge that can tell you what the code is.
This does not sound like you getting out.
The key is guessing where it starts and where it ends.
Is he right or left-handed?
Right. Why?
Right-handed people
instinctively draw counterclockwise.
I told you to get out.
Forsythe has a whole lab back here.
Microscopes, test tubes,
all kinds of forensic equipment.
Forsythe came back.
Almost done.
Did you set off an alarm?
Peter, that's hurtful.
Either way, he's headed your way.
All right, leaving now.
Where are you?
Where are you?
It's called a macuahuitl.
"Macua-neenle."
No, "macua-heetle."
"Macua-heednum."
No, "macua-heetle."
I said that.
Okay, either way, your hunch is right.
It was stolen from a pre-Columbian exhibit
here in new york.
I guess Forsythe does some business
in the black market after all.
Yeah, but get this. It was stolen eight years ago.
Statute of limitations is up.
Forsythe's a smart guy.
He knows we can't get him on it.
Sure, he didn't want to raise
a red flag in front of a bull.
Not when he's hiding something bigger.
For a job as big as a T-rex,
he'd wanna use somebody he can trust,
somebody he'd used before.
Any suspects in the macuahuitl theft?
There were no arrests, but there were three suspects.
One's in jail.
One recently questioned in Prague.
Then there's this guy, Michael Holt.
Suspected in four other robberies along the east coast.
He doesn't stay in one place very long.
No, but even a master thief needs time to unload
a 40-foot prehistoric skeleton.
Either way, we've got a narrow window
before he leaves town.
Track him down.
Before we do,
you wanna know why Caffrey
was standing on that street corner?
Yeah, I do.
What do you have?
Not what. It's who.
I got this off a security camera from across the street.
She looks familiar.
Her name's Rebecca Lowe.
Yeah, the woman we brought in
from the Gershon heist a while back.
What's Neal doing with her?
You know, I was talking to El,
she has a friend she'd like to set you up with.
Does this friend know that I come with a rap sheet?
Interested?
Tell Elizabeth thank you, but I'm not looking right now.
Well, it's been a while since Sara,
and I thought you might wanna get back out there.
Not that it's difficult for you.
You'd be surprised.
Anyone I date, I have to lie to
or wonder why she's interested in a felon.
No luck at all?
Yeah, Jones?
Where to?
Yeah.
Okay, thanks.
Holt's gone.
Jones checked his credit cards.
He bought a plane ticket out of the country.
The only reason I'd buy a plane ticket under my name
with my credit card is if I wanted someone
to think I'd left the country.
The airline confirmed that he got on the plane.
The airline confirmed someone with Holt's ticket got on the plane.
You know that time you thought I was in Monaco?
Don't tell me
that I had interpol scouring the streets for nothing.
Bought a first-class ticket under my name
and checked in for my flight.
Once I got to the gate,
I looked for someone traveling alone with a carry-on.
If someone checks a bag
and doesn't get on the plane,
the flight doesn't take off.
So I offer them my ticket,
which of course they're gonna take.
Because no sane person facing a 3,000-mile trip
is gonna say no to a seat in first class.
And they don't suspect an ulterior motive?
Not everyone is as naturally suspicious as you, Peter.
My nature has developed
from years of tracking your suspicious behavior.
So this unsuspecting stranger
gets your ticket, gets on the plane.
And Neal Caffrey is on his way to Monaco,
while the real Neal Caffrey
slips out of the gate unnoticed.
I can't believe you never knew that.
Cameras caught Michael Holt
scoping out their security system.
He's still after that egg.
He thinks it's at the museum.
Catching Holt in the act
is our best shot at tracking down that stolen T-rex.
I'll put surveillance teams
outside the museum around the clock.
Keep me posted.
All right.
Well, I guess someone else enjoyed that first-class ticket.
So.
Holt had 1/2 million good reasons to stay.
How did you know what Forsythe was gonna pay Holt?
I found a briefcase full of cash in his back room.
And you opened it?
See, this is the reason I have a suspicious nature.
I'm gonna count every penny of it.
I don't blame you. You should.
It was a rough estimate though,
it's a round number.
Hey, hon.
Yeah.
How'd you like to go on a double date tonight?
With Trey and Sheila?
Neal.
Does he know we're coming?
He doesn't know we're coming.
He's been sneaking around with this woman,
And I think he's up to something.
Or maybe he's having a nice meal with a nice girl.
There's no reason for Neal to keep this from me.
What do I care if he's going on a date with a girl?
Clearly you care quite a bit.
Nah, there's more to it than this.
A lot of things Neal has been doing don't add up,
and my gut tells me she's at the center of it.
Now according to his anklet,
they're at the Clifton.
You know I've always wanted to go to the Clifton.
Really?
You think this is a good idea?
I do.
Thought you might like this.
The wine is lovely.
And it reminds me of this summer that I spent in France studying.
I actually think I've been to this vineyard.
Really?
Really.
Did you have the FBI run a background check on me?
The FBI had nothing to do with this dinner.
I promise.
You know, you never told me
why you became an FBI agent.
I assume it wasn't only to pick up women.
How does an art lover become an FBI agent?
It's a long story.
I spend my life studying ancient texts.
I don't mind long stories.
I want this dinner to be about you and me, okay?
We don't need to talk about work.
All right.
I really do like this place.
And the wine and the codex.
And the kiss.
I liked that part too.
You know, you-- you don't have to do all this
just to get my help on the case.
Do you really think I would do that?
No.
What kind of guy do you think I am?
I don't know. You're an FBI agent.
Yeah.
If it's too complicated, I'll understand.
Are you trying to give me a way out?
Apparently without much subtlety.
No.
I don't want one.
Do you?
No.
Neal?
Peter, what are you doing here?
Elizabeth has been dying to try this place out.
Hi, I'm Peter, Neal's boss.
We've met. I'm Rebecca.
You almost arrested me.
Oh, right. Sorry about that.
No, it's-- wait, I thought your boss was...
And this is Elizabeth, Peter's lovely wife.
It's so nice to meet you.
I'm really sorry for interrupting.
Oh, nonsense.
No secrets between friends, right?
Course not.
I didn't know that you two had been in touch
since the investigation.
You guys met on a case?
Oh, yeah, you know.
How sometimes your personal and professional lives
just crash into each other without any notice.
It's actually how Peter and I met.
Yeah, agency resources were involved from what I recall.
It was completely aboveboard.
Actually, we were just talking
about how Neal became an FBI agent.
Yeah, but it's a long story.
I know I'd love to hear that story.
Um, I'm gonna go check and see if we can get a table.
Would you like to go with me?
Maybe let the boys chat?
Of course.
See you in a little bit.
What are you doing here?
Did you follow me here?
You have until they come back
to explain why she thinks you're an FBI agent,
or I'm telling her the truth.
We met on a case.
I told her I work for the FBI.
She assumed I was an agent.
And you didn't correct her, did you?
I didn't see any reason to.
Because you're impersonating a federal officer.
I suppose technically--
No, not technically. You are.
The pen, the chiropractor's office.
This is all to convince her of this story.
You're--
You like her, don't you?
Lying is a funny way of showing it.
She doesn't look at me like a criminal, okay?
She looks at me
the way El looks at you.
I don't want to ruin that.
Neal, you have lovely friends.
Oh, aren't they great?
We are gonna get out of your hair right now.
We got a table. Come on, let's go.
Sure.
You two have lots to talk about.
Excuse me one minute.
This is Agent Burke.
It's Dr. Khatri.
Someone's here.
I don't recognize him.
All right, remain calm, doctor.
We have agents in the museum.
No, I'm not there.
I took the egg to my lab to run a CAT scan.
Hang up and find someplace safe.
We'll be there soon.
Neal, we have to go.
Dr. Khatri's in trouble.
NYPD is on the way, but we're closer.
We're running out of time!
You better tell me where it is!
What, you think I'm playing games?
I'll never give it to you.
It's Holt.
I'm not gonna ask again.
If we go in with guns drawn, he might shoot her.
Khatri's not giving up that egg.
We gotta come up with something,
or she's gonna get herself killed.
Where the hell is the egg?
Where is the mother? What have you done with her?
It's just an egg. Tell me where it is.
It's so much more than that.
It is a child that needs to be with its mother,
and I'll be damned if I'll ever give it up to you.
Have it your way.
Doctor, do you have the isotopic results--
Hold it right there.
I don't want any trouble, okay?
Where is the damn egg?
I'll show you.
No, you can't give it to him.
I'm not taking a bullet for a fossil, all right?
Follow me.
Right through here.
Get off of me!
Give me a hand.
Not every thief who brings their own handcuffs.
Very thoughtful of you.
Holt confirmed that Forsythe hired him
for the fossil heist.
So why are you not doing
an "about to get the dinosaur" happy dance?
Because he doesn't know where the dinosaur is located.
And if we arrest Forsythe now,
there's no guarantee we'll get the T-rex back.
And our evidence is largely circumstantial.
I want hard proof.
You want the dinosaur.
Damn right I do.
Dr. Khatri will be happy to hear that.
Just got off with the hospital.
She's fine,
just a little shaken up.
There's only one chip we can play right now.
The egg.
We can plant a tracker on it.
I bet he'll stash it with the T-rex fossils.
Follow him, make a clean arrest.
I don't wanna put the egg in play.
It's too valuable, too important.
Lucky for us,
we know someone with a history of forging fossils.
Dr. Khatri gave me fragments
of real calcite shell and sedimentary rock.
I'll sculpt the core from alabaster.
Adhesives?
Already mixed.
We should get started.
I assume you don't mean the royal we?
A correct assumption.
The hydrochloric acid is reacting perfectly
with the calcium carbonate in the shell.
We made a baby dinosaur, Moz.
Ah, like father, like forged embryo.
Each with his own anklet.
At least Peter won't be able to follow this tracker to Rebecca.
Oh, have you spoken to her since your ill-fated dinner?
I warned you, Neal.
You, business, and women.
Unholy trinity, I get it.
Well, you can be grateful
that the suit didn't expose your agent nom de guerre.
Well, I am.
What happens when Peter digs deeper?
Could find out about the Codex.
Yeah, or Hagen.
Cause for concern.
Keep in mind, to make an end is to make a beginning.
You think I should end it with her?
That was T.S. Eliot.
But if Rebecca is on big brother's radar,
the timing could be right.
All right, do we have a game plan for the church yet?
I'm working on it.
But to steal the stained glass window
will be difficult with so many witnesses.
Well, that's a problem that can wait a day.
Indeed.
Today we revive the cretaceous period.
Tomorrow we steal a window
that could be connected to a bedlamite's tome.
C'est la vie.
C'est la vie.
Not bad.
I was gonna give it to you after this,
but if you don't think it's very good--
"Not bad" doesn't mean "Not good."
It doesn't mean "Good."
I'll give it to someone who can appreciate it.
No, this is FBI property. I can take it if I want.
Okay, the tracker's live.
When Forsythe moves the egg, we'll be right behind him.
Neal, tell us about your cover.
John Mcdowell. Accomplice to Michael Holt.
Here to deliver the egg.
Because the FBI is looking into Holt, and he's laying low.
Which was confirmed by Holt
when he called Forsythe to set up the meeting.
We'll have ears on you the whole time.
With a forgery like this, you should be out quickly.
With half million in cash.
The FBI is investigating holt?
Should I worry?
Nah, it's just one agent shaking every tree he can find
to see what falls out.
He doesn't have anything.
But to be safe, I'm here instead of Holt.
Hey, if you don't want the egg anymore,
I'm sure I can unload it somewhere else.
No, no, no, no. It's fine.
I wanna see it.
Uh-uh. No, it's not yours yet.
Not till you pay me.
You're getting ahead of yourself.
I need to authenticate it first.
Let's get a move on.
Ticktock.
Calcite levels and pebble texture appear appropriate.
I assume that's good news.
Oh, it very much is.
Then I think this is the part where you pay me.
I will.
After one last test.
Can't tell you how many times
two-bit hustlers have tried to rip me off
with fake artifacts.
Which is where the CAT scan comes in handy.
He won't see an embryo on a CAT scan.
But he will see the tracker.
The scan will take about ten minutes.
So settle in.
Look, I didn't think this was gonna be an all-day thing. Okay?
You worried the scan won't work?
No, I just don't understand what this thing is gonna show you
that all the other tests didn't.
It'll show me what's inside.
Or what isn't.
We need to pull Neal out of there.
Wait, Dr. Khatri should have a CAT scan of the egg.
I'll call to see if she can send one to us.
You ever heard of a macuahuitl?
It's the weapon you're holding in your hands right now.
What else can you tell me about this weapon, John?
Anything about this one in particular?
I stole it for you eight years ago
with Holt right here in New York.
You're holding it wrong.
You mind?
The early macuahuitl handle is 2 inches wider at the top.
Hold it like this.
Better grip means a faster swing.
More control.
You're right.
You know, I've stolen a lot of things,
but I've rarely taken anything just to have it.
You should try it sometime.
We should be at the embryo any moment now.
Yeah?
Why is he here?
Fine.
I'll be right there.
Who's here?
That FBI agent. Still shaking his trees.
Don't worry, I'll get rid of him.
Mr. Forsythe, thanks for seeing me.
I won't take up much of your time.
Michael Holt, he's our prime suspect
in the fossil shipment theft.
What's it got to do with me?
I was wondering if maybe he approached you on buying them.
Well, if he contacts me, you'll be my first call.
All I wanted to hear.
Then you'll be on your way.
You know, even though their name means "Speedy thief,"
they say that the Velociraptor wasn't particularly fast.
That's true.
And that it was dumb.
Yeah, not much room for a brain in there, I guess.
One slow, dumb chicken with big teeth.
Don't touch the skull.
How do you keep them glued in there?
Epoxy or Tacky?
Agent Burke, don't--
Guess you should've used superglue.
Is that all?
Mm-hmm.
Sorry I broke your dinosaur.
Well, look at that.
Money's in the briefcase.
Pleasure doing business with you.
The things people do when they think no one's watching.
Like following your friend to a first date
and crashing it?
Come on.
Let's show Forsythe how the FBI handles natural selection.
You just think of that one?
Yeah, on the way over.
What the hell are you doing here?
I thought about what you said.
I figured out what I wanna take.
How'd you follow me?
That little guy told me where you were.
Or at least a GPS tracker we put inside it did.
Let's go.
Open it up.
Okay, that definitely captures my imagination.
You know, it's not too late for you to be a paleontologist.
Some things are better enjoyed from a distance.
Oh, like grand larceny.
Are all of your hobbies illegal?
I like chess.
You hustled chess in Union Square.
Agent Burke.
Mr. Caffrey, follow me.
You need to see this.
Here she is.
She's...
majestic.
This mother and child reunion
was only possible because of you two.
The museum is in your debt.
I know someone who would love a year-round pass.
Agent Burke, you have VIP status here.
Our doors are always open.
Peter Burke, VIP. We should get you a badge.
Quiet. Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.
Come by the house for dinner tonight.
El's cooking Branzino.
Branzino, look at you.
I can be fancy.
Thanks for the invitation, but--
It's not an invitation.
So it's an order?
7 p.m.
Don't be late, Agent Caffrey.
Bad news.
Another amazing meal.
Well, it should be. It's your recipe.
Should've thrown it on a barbecue.
Never let him be sous chef.
He's actually very good on the barbecue.
So...Rebecca.
Yeah, Rebecca.
What do you wanna know?
Have you told her everything?
Everything?
Why you're working for the FBI?
Why you're wearing an anklet?
Has she seen it?
Okay, I was waiting for the right time.
There's no right time, Neal.
What do you think happens if I tell her the truth?
The more time passes,
the more the truth will hurt.
If you really want this to work,
tell her now.
Pray she'll accept it.
You agree?
If you really care about Rebecca,
she deserves to know the real you.
Okay, if Peter had told you something like this
when you first met, would you have accepted it?
Honestly, Neal, I-- I don't know.
But I'd want the choice to decide.
And so will Rebecca.
It's a risk you should take.
I don't wanna ask why you have that thing.
Mm, it was there for the taking.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Byron always said the city spoke to him.
I can relate to that.
You're a lot like him.
How did you feel when he told you he was a criminal?
It hurt.
But I loved him.
And it didn't matter what he was.
It only mattered who he was.
I wish I could separate the two.
Well, you'll learn with time.
Just a second.
Hey. Find something new?
Yeah.
Great.
No.
I was gonna lie, pretend I found something,
but I just wanted to come see you.
Whatever this is between us,
I...I don't want it to stop.
I don't either.
Yeah?
But there's something you should know about me.
Okay.
I'm not an FBI agent.
I'm a criminal informant.
I was convicted of bond forgery
and served part of a four-year sentence
before I became a C.I.
I'm--I don't understand.
I've been to your office.
I've been working with your boss, Agent Gruetzner.
Yeah, he's not my boss.
My real boss is Peter Burke,
who you met at dinner.
That office was just a setup
to get your help with the codex.
You set up a fake office all so you could lie to me?
Are you even researching the codex?
I am.
Just not for the FBI.
Rebecca.
Why would you do this to me?
I needed your help, all right?
And I--
I didn't expect this.
I didn't expect us.
Is there anything else I should know?
Thank you.
I think I was just--
June!
Neal!
I was just chatting with this wonderful man,
Mr...
You can call me "Curtis."
Curtis. It's a lovely name.
Thank you.
Well, I think...
I'll just be running along.
You stay away from her, Hagen.
Quite the life you've built.
Hate to see things fall apart over one little window.
That's right, I know that the codex leads to the window.
Isn't it lucky you were already planning to steal it for me?
That was what you were planning, wasn't it?
Of course.
Good.
That would be best for everyone.
