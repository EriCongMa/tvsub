they found ali &apos;s body .
i &apos;m still here , bitches .
and i know everything .
alison .
she is alive and i can prove it .
alison is alive ?
surprise .
the cash , passport and plane ticket ,
you need to leave for the airport in an hour .
until i know who &quot; a &quot; is , i can &apos;t come home .
let &quot; a &quot; think you &apos;re dead .
mona played me like a fool .
she got exactly what she wanted .
ezra &apos;s still looking for me , aria .
he thinks that if he saves me , he &apos;ll win you back .
if you &apos;re looking to make a deal ...
i know who killed that girl ,
the one you thought was alison dilaurentis .
ali , run !
hey , hey , i know who you are .
no .
i &apos;m sorry .
his pulse is getting weaker .
hey , let me go , please .
i heard a gunshot and i ran up to the roof .
but when i got there , he was lying on the ground .
aria , we cannot do anything to help him right now .
if they think you know anything about this ,
you &apos;re gonna spend the entire night
answering questions at the police station .
you &apos;re never gonna get to the hospital .
spencer &apos;s right .
we &apos;ll find out where they &apos;re taking him and we &apos;ll get you there .
folks , could you step back please ?
priority one . mid @-@ 20s , male .
single gsw to the abdomen .
last pulse was 142 . systolic 80 .
he &apos;s herniating . get him to the or .
you know what to say , right ?
don &apos;t stay on the line a second longer than you have to .
it &apos;s the strongest one they had .
are you sure you want to do this ?
ezra just saved my life .
and he probably saved yours , too .
hanna &apos;s right .
there &apos;s no way my mom made that jump .
she &apos;s not &quot; a. &quot; but ezra knows who is .
look , em , the plan was to get ali out of town tonight ,
but now that we know that &quot; a &apos;s &quot; after ezra ...
i get that &quot; a &quot; wants to shut ezra up ,
okay , but ali &apos;s still a target .
can &apos;t we think of another way to do this ?
if ezra ...
when ezra pulls through ,
he &apos;s going to tell us who &quot; a &quot; is ,
and this thing is finally gonna be over .
hi , the guy who just got shot
at bank and hudson is ezra fitz .
yeah , i think that you should send a cop
to the hospital because i saw what happened ,
and i don &apos;t think this was a random thing .
well , yeah , but he might not be safe
so you better go fast .
are they sending somebody ?
yeah , i heard her typing .
look , they &apos;re probably on their way .
are we sure that we want to split up ?
a wise commander takes measures
to always let his opponent react
to the wrong set of circumstances .
and in 400 bc--
okay , spencer , we get it . we &apos;re decoys .
we don &apos;t need a history lesson .
there &apos;s no art to this war , spencer .
you &apos;ve read sun tzu ?
okay , let &apos;s go .
wait .
just in case .
we &apos;ll give you 10 minutes , okay ,
and then we &apos;re making the call .
em , come on .
look , if you want to get to the hospital before them ,
we have to go now .
we know that &quot; a &quot; is always one step ahead of us .
yeah .
maybe he , she , it , bitch is .
but you have to remember that
ali &apos;s been hiding in plain sight for two years .
she can handle herself .
and if &quot; a &quot; sees us there first ,
then this could work .
thank you for checking in , ashley .
nobody &apos;s getting any sleep here tonight ,
so don &apos;t hesitate to call if you hear from hanna .
of course . we &apos;ll do the same .
bye .
all this time spencer knew alison was alive ?
i don &apos;t want to believe that ,
because if that &apos;s true ,
i have no idea who your sister is .
the photograph that detective holbrook showed me
of the girls with alison was taken a month ago .
i want to think that that was the first time they saw her ,
because it makes sense ,
that &apos;s when it all started again .
the pills ?
the pills and the lying .
it was just like last time spencer was out of control .
it &apos;s so like ali to do this to her .
honey , we don &apos;t know anything about
where alison &apos;s been or what she &apos;s gone through .
i &apos;m trying to reserve judgment .
mom , alison was at the center of every mess
that spencer got into .
she &apos;s a walking time bomb ,
but it &apos;s never ali who blows up .
it &apos;s everything and everyone else around her .
i understand running away .
but to let your friends and family think you &apos;re dead ?
i really thought it was alison in that grave .
we all did .
but i saw that picture
and she &apos;s very much alive .
i &apos;m not crying for alison .
there is another family missing their daughter .
and she really is dead .
the police will find out who that girl is .
it &apos;s just a matter of time .
mom ...
there &apos;s something you need to know .
i don &apos;t understand how ezra found us .
maybe he didn &apos;t find us .
i think he was following &quot; a. &quot;
and &quot; a &quot; was following us .
this is what you were always so afraid of .
that we &apos;d lead &quot; a &quot; to you .
aria , you know why ezra &apos;s still looking for me .
it &apos;s &apos; cause he wants to win you back .
does he have a chance ?
ali , i can &apos;t think about that right now .
i don &apos;t even know if he &apos;s alive .
i wanted to tell you in person
that cece drake escaped police custody tonight .
we found officer maple unconscious
on a road outside of town .
so far we have not been able
to locate cece or his patrol car .
i don &apos;t understand why you came here to tell us this .
cece knows that alison is alive
and i think she knows where the girls are .
if she &apos;s mixed up in this ,
your daughter could be in more danger than ever .
so if there &apos;s anything
that you haven &apos;t told me ...
we &apos;ve told you everything that we know .
police have also widened their search
for the four missing rosewood teens
who they believe are in philadelphia
with alison dilaurentis .
the youth went missing two years ago
and is thought to have been brutally murdered---
this changes everything .
there &apos;s a ton of debris in here .
i need hands .
he &apos;s losing too much blood .
clamp that artery .
now !
okay .
i &apos;m doing my part , mr. fitz .
you got to do yours .
don &apos;t die on me .
this way .
let &apos;s go .
okay , now what do we do ?
we wait .
hi , we are looking for a patient
that was just admitted , ezra fitz ?
i hate this .
let &apos;s just hope it works .
alison dilaurentis ,
please report to the emergency room .
alison dilaurentis report to the emergency room .
事情发生了 听领导指示
okay , you better get out of here .
stairs !
want to play ?
it &apos;s over .
no . it &apos;s not .
did you really think we &apos;d let ali
leave that hospital alone ?
we paged alison so you &apos;d know she was there .
i guess you don &apos;t read sun tzu , bitch .
are you sure that &apos;s &quot; a &quot; ?
maybe i &apos;m &quot; a &quot; !
or maybe it &apos;s one of them .
maybe i &apos;m &quot; a. &quot;
nypd break it up .
all right , folks , we need you to disperse now .
&quot; a &quot; was one step ahead of us .
at least we got &quot; a &quot; away from ezra .
let &apos;s get out of here .
mrs. fitzgerald .
we &apos;ve successfully removed the bullet
but arterial damage is extensive .
yes , that &apos;s right .
yes .
you need to stay on top of this .
we &apos;re mobilizing .
they &apos;re not in philadelphia ...
they &apos;re in new york .
you said there &apos;d be more people here .
they &apos;re coming .
you scared me .
i can &apos;t keep this a secret anymore .
i want to tell holbrook the truth .
when spencer finds out ,
she &apos;ll have a reason to come home .
your mother can never know what you told me .
this is holbrook .
a detective from the nypd is on the line .
put him through .
we &apos;ve got a lot going on here tonight .
what can i help you with ?
why would a shooting in new york involve us ?
okay , i &apos;ll look into him and get back to you .
thank you .
教师 玫瑰镇高中
i &apos;m sorry you lost that bitch ,
but you did get &quot; a &quot; out of here .
is ezra out of surgery ?
i heard them tell ezra &apos;s mom
that the bullet traveled up and hit ...
she &apos;s getting on a plane , but she &apos;s in sydney .
and there &apos;s nobody here for him but me .
do you want us to come there ?
no .
no , so far i &apos;m blending in ,
but i think with the five of us ,
it might be waving a red flag .
once he &apos;s out of surgery ,
it &apos;s still gonna take him a few hours to wake up .
we need to find somewhere to go .
call us as soon as you hear anything .
i will .
guys , promise me you &apos;ll be safe .
don &apos;t worry about us , aria .
we &apos;ll be okay . we promise .
bye .
if &quot; a &quot; can &apos;t get to ezra ,
you &apos;re the available target tonight .
yeah , em &apos;s right .
i mean , we can &apos;t just stand out here
in the street like sitting ...
ducks .
i know a place we can go .
come on .
if you wanted to impress someone with a &quot; wow &quot; moment ,
this would definitely be how you &apos;d do it .
he didn &apos;t bring me here to impress me .
this was kind of his special place .
so you know somebody who works here ?
uh , yeah , a friend of the family .
well , when you said that you were gonna take me to the theater ,
i thought you meant to see a play .
are you disappointed ?
i get it .
get what ?
it &apos;s hard to explain .
try me .
god , imagine being up here ,
with all those people out there who love you .
i think that &apos;s called adoration , not love .
i could be an actress .
could be ?
well , i hate to break it to you
but you already are .
the way you tell your stories with such conviction .
i think you &apos;ve convinced yourself
that half of them are true .
well , if you can &apos;t convince yourself ,
why should anyone else believe you ?
you really are my holly golightly .
who ?
are you sure we &apos;re allowed to be here ?
who &apos;s there ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry , mr. fitzgerald .
my apologies .
i was just locking up on my way out .
no , don &apos;t worry about it , bill .
have a good night .
okay , good night .
mr. fitzgerald ?
that &apos;s when i realized ezra was a rich boy
pretending to be a poor boy .
i actually liked him more for that .
not because he didn &apos;t want the money ,
but because he totally had me fooled .
i actually thought that was an asset back then .
this is a real gun .
hanna !
so you think we &apos;ll be okay here until morning ?
i &apos;ve stayed over a few times .
they don &apos;t open up the place until noon .
what was that ?
spencer &apos;s stomach .
sorry , i haven &apos;t had anything to eat
since a petit four at the bridal show .
come on , let &apos;s raid the concession stand .
you think that it &apos;s still gonna be stocked ?
spence , we need to get you some food .
i &apos;m literally at the point where i cannot think .
well , i guess nutty chews can count as a protein
and gummy bears as a fruit .
i don &apos;t care , i was so hungry
i was about to eat the foam out of those seat cushions .
i saw that episode .
me , too .
that lady went through three couches in a year .
what show is this ?
freaky foodies .
have you seen it ?
spencer &apos;s obsessed .
what and you &apos;re not ?
we watched that entire marathon together .
oh , my god , remember that guy who ate the dryer sheets ?
ew , that was so gross .
i need to find a better place to make a call .
who do you need to talk to ?
i have a few friends that are gonna be worried
now that the police know i &apos;m alive .
they &apos;ve risked a lot to help me ,
i just need to let them know that i &apos;m okay .
i &apos;ll be right back .
hello .
yeah , it &apos;s me .
shana ?
ali sent me to make sure you &apos;re okay .
look , i get that you &apos;re her loyal companion ,
but i don &apos;t need a watchdog .
you don &apos;t have to like me , aria .
but i made a promise , so i &apos;m staying .
can i get you something ?
no . thanks .
you look exhausted .
don &apos;t worry .
if you fall asleep , i &apos;ll wake you up
if there &apos;s any news .
i &apos;m fine .
is it just me or does it already feel like
she &apos;s shutting us out again ?
what ?
she can hear you .
she &apos;s sleeping .
she &apos;s ali .
she &apos;s sleeping .
thanks , han .
it makes sense that ali had people helping her .
you know , if it were us , we &apos;d want her to call .
we &apos;d want to know that she was okay .
that &apos;s the thing , em . it is us .
we &apos;re the ones who are risking everything to help her .
it &apos;s not some random do @-@ gooders
that she &apos;s met along the way .
we just have to wait it out a few more hours .
once ezra tells us who &quot; a &quot; is ,
this will finally be over .
from your lips to god &apos;s ears .
when did you become religious ?
my mom &apos;s dating a preacher , remember ?
can you imagine what life would be like without &quot; a &quot; ?
when was the last time you guys had a hobby ?
never .
i wouldn &apos;t mind taking up a sport though .
which one ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve always liked spencer &apos;s field hockey skirt .
you can totally have it .
what about you , spence ?
i wouldn &apos;t want to go back to the person
that i was before .
all i cared about was winning .
and now i just really want to be happy .
how did you find me ?
well , we don &apos;t just look alike .
we think alike , too .
you took a big risk coming here .
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
alison , you asked for my help in ravenswood .
now i need yours .
斯宾塞 · 海斯汀和玫瑰镇高中教员
so fitz is a fitzgerald .
are you sure this is gonna work ?
it has to .
i don &apos;t have another choice .
we should be okay if we do this today .
the cops are still looking in philadelphia .
you having second thoughts ?
no .
i just realized this might be the last time i see you .
don &apos;t be so dramatic , ali .
you know us .
we always find a way back to each other .
is this the part where you guys kiss ?
had to ask .
you better get going .
thank you .
you &apos;d do the same for me .
is ezra fitz out of surgery ?
he &apos;s in recovery .
what are you doing ?
you said that you &apos;d wake me up .
he &apos;s still unconscious , but he &apos;s stable .
ezra ?
help !
help !
help ! we need some help in here !
hurry !
code blue , we need 123 .
where have you been ?
em , please don &apos;t wake up the others .
we &apos;re all in this together , ali .
at least that &apos;s what we thought .
there are some things
you don &apos;t need to know about , em .
okay ?
it &apos;s better that way .
that &apos;s not a good enough answer .
come on .
some of you may know each other ,
some of you may not .
but i picked you
because we all have one thing
in common ,
and that &apos;s alison dilaurentis .
when alison was here , i wasn &apos;t mona .
i was loser mona .
who were you , lucas ?
hermie .
how about you , paige ?
i can say it if you don &apos;t want to .
she called you pigskin .
i was pus face .
i was newt .
lez .
whore .
but you weren &apos;t those people .
that &apos;s just what she called you .
not who you are .
sticks and stones , mona .
i &apos;m not afraid of her anymore .
well , maybe you should be .
she &apos;s not even back yet , and she found a way
to break up you and emily .
there &apos;s no way
ali &apos;s gonna let you guys be a couple .
exactly what is it you want us to do ?
i want us to stick together .
there &apos;s strength in numbers .
the bigger we are , the harder she falls .
i don &apos;t think i want to be a part of this .
i can &apos;t protect you if you &apos;re not with us .
we don &apos;t have much time .
ezra was paying cece for information .
that &apos;s why she was in ravenswood .
so she wasn &apos;t ever really red coat ?
no , i asked her to wear that hoping that
she would distract &quot; a &quot; so i could turn off the saw .
&quot; a &quot; put you in that box . not cece .
she helped me save your life .
why does this have to be a secret ?
why can &apos;t you tell the other girls ?
cece killed a cop , em ,
and part of why she did that was for me .
look , if she gets busted boarding that plane ,
my face is on the passport .
that makes me an accessory .
and now you know about it .
that makes you one , too .
you guys have done so much for me .
you do not need to go out on a limb for cece .
i will take the fall for it alone
if it comes to it .
hey , aria &apos;s on the phone , but we can &apos;t hear her .
tell her to call the house line .
ezra made it through surgery ,
but i haven &apos;t been able to--
damn it .
hello , can you hear me ?
hello ?
alison ?
what is it ?
the nypd needs to send somebody
to the fitzgerald theater on west 44th street .
i think we have a 10 @-@ 20 on alison dilaurentis .
oh , pick up .
come on , guys . pick up .
you &apos;re gonna be okay .
what is it ?
did you recognize the voice ?
no .
okay .
we can &apos;t wait for ezra to tell us who &quot; a &quot; is .
we have to get you to the airport .
you can still use that passport
and that ticket that noel gave you , right ?
i don &apos;t have it anymore .
what ?
i gave away my get out of town free card
to someone who needed it more than i did .
ali , who needs more help than you do right now ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
it does to us .
look , ali , either you trust us or you don &apos;t .
no more secrets , ali .
you were wrong before .
they didn &apos;t keep us together .
we can argue about this in the cab .
okay ? let &apos;s grab our stuff and go .
come on .
but we have to hurry .
who &apos;s out there ?
couldn &apos;t have picked a better place
to end your story .
shana ?
shana ?
i thought i locked you all together at the lodge .
but i guess you were late to the party , alison .
so much for fighting fire with fire .
put the gun down , shana .
get back , spencer .
get back .
i trusted you , shana .
you once told me the only way to trust
someone was to not ask too many questions .
and then you sent me to rosewood to ask questions .
move .
shana .
why--
why would you turn on me like this ?
i got so many answers from all the people you hurt .
your own mother was afraid of you .
get back !
ali &apos;s made mistakes ,
okay , shana , but what makes you better ?
you &apos;re sick , shana .
like mona was , but we can get you help .
i &apos;m not mona . this isn &apos;t a game .
so what is it ?
justice .
for who ?
jenna .
you fell in love with her .
you have no idea who she is .
we never meant--
get back or i &apos;ll blow your head off !
what did you call it once , ali ?
a happy accident ?
jenna doesn &apos;t love you , shana .
she &apos;s playing you .
that &apos;s what she does .
no , that &apos;s what you do .
so what ?
she &apos;s the mastermind and you &apos;re her henchman ?
jenna doesn &apos;t even know i &apos;m here .
and she &apos;ll never know .
and once i &apos;m done with you ,
she can finally get back to her life .
hey , shana !
she &apos;s dead .
you did what you had to do , okay ?
spencer &apos;s right .
she would have killed all of us .
it really is over .
it &apos;s over .
yeah .
let &apos;s go home .
we can &apos;t just leave her here .
there &apos;s been an accident .
enjoy your flight , sir .
welcome aboard , miss darkbloom .
merci .
