howard wolowitz .
hey , howard . dave roeger here at nasa .
we need to talk about your upcoming mission .
yes , yes , i &apos;ve been doing my push @-@ ups .
i &apos;m still stuck at nine , but ...
... that &apos;s going all the way down with no one holding me .
that &apos;s great , uh , but that &apos;s not why i called .
we &apos;ve run into a bit of a snafu .
your soyuz capsule failed the pressurization test ,
so bottom line , mission &apos;s been scrubbed .
you &apos;re kidding . so what does that mean ?
boy , i got to tell you ,
i &apos;m really disappointed .
this was my dream ever since i was a little kid .
okay , well , uh , thanks for the call .
yep , you , too .
yes ! thank you !
i &apos;m not gonna die in space !
i &apos;m gonna die the way god intended ,
in my late 50s , with a heart full of pastrami .
i &apos;m going to need a larger shirt .
this one &apos;s a little tight under the arms .
okay .
do you think maybe it &apos;s tight
because you &apos;re wearing long underwear ?
yes , of course that &apos;s why it &apos;s tight .
all right , let me rephrase the question .
why are you wearing long underwear ?
you &apos;re kidding .
shouldn &apos;t the question be : why &lt; i &gt; aren &apos;t &lt; / i &gt; you ?
no , it should be : why are you ?
leonard , these rental tuxedos have been
worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers .
i don &apos;t like my own sweat touching my skin ,
how do you think i feel about theirs ?
why don &apos;t you slip this on ?
said the hangman offering a noose .
well , that wasn &apos;t as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes ,
but it was right up there .
well , that &apos;s it .
my orders have been rescinded .
i am officially &quot; no go &quot; to space .
i &apos;m sorry , howard , but i got to tell you ,
i &apos;m a little relieved you &apos;re not going .
why ?
come on , you were gonna go up in a rocket
designed in the 1960s by the russians .
yeah , so ?
when was the last time you were at best buy
and you heard someone say , &quot; ooh , check out this blu @-@ ray player ,
it must be good , it was built in russia &quot; ?
well , their technology isn &apos;t that bad .
when you come back to earth in a soyuz capsule ,
you free @-@ fall from space at 500 miles per hour ,
and the only thing that slows you down
is a little parachute that pops out
right before you crash into the ground .
and the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds
美国六十年代经典卡通片 《 飞鼠洛基冒险记 》 的主角
who were unable to capture rocky and bullwinkle .
all right , well , whatever .
i wasn &apos;t worried .
you weren &apos;t ?
let me explain the difference between you and me .
you watch &lt; i &gt; star trek &lt; / i &gt;
i live it .
oh , please . i don &apos;t remember the episode of &lt; i &gt; star trek &lt; / i &gt;
where the guy never goes to space
and brags about it in a tuxedo store .
make all the jokes you want ,
but there &apos;s only one of us here brave enough
to almost do what i almost did .
ah , much better .
you must be burning up .
a little . but not more than your urethras will be
after whatever &apos;s in those pants swims up them .
i cut quite the dashing , yet hygienic figure , don &apos;t i ?
i look like the flash about to get married .
oh ! a tissue ! a tissue !
oh , good lord !
uh , where &apos;s he going ?
he keeps emergency purell in the car .
keys ! keys ! keys !
hey , you .
before i come in ,
you should know , i have gas .
for the record , not your worst opening line .
check it out . it &apos;s the gas i use
in my free @-@ electron laser to support high voltages .
but it also has an interesting secondary use .
here . breathe this in .
b @-@ before i do it ,
if you &apos;re a cop you have to tell me , right ?
just try it .
okay .
what &apos;s it supposed to ...
oh , my god , that &apos;s so freaky !
you &apos;re a mean one
mr. grinch .
okay . me , me , me . ready ?
leonard , i am your father .
i have never been more attracted to a woman
who sounds like a man in my life .
hey ... you know how we &apos;ve been ...
taking things slow ?
well , i &apos;ve been thinking , and ...
maybe i &apos;m ready to ...
take things a little ... faster .
oh , great .
and i promise , after waiting four months ,
fast is what you &apos;re gonna get .
you know , just @-@ just one thing .
look , we &apos;re in a really great place right now ,
and i don &apos;t want to do anything
that will make stuff all weird again .
so we won &apos;t let it get weird .
okay . oh , and just a heads @-@ up ...
mm , since the last time you saw me naked ,
i got a cookie monster tattoo .
the acceptable response &quot; s when you see it
are &quot; awesome &quot; or nothing .
what about ...
cookies !
amy ?
amy ?
amy ?
7 : 00 , right on time .
it &apos;s not an accident .
i waited outside your door for 20 minutes .
well , dinner &apos;s almost ready .
i must say ,
i was surprised you chose to spend
our date night in your apartment .
as i mentioned ,
the pasadena city council is debating longer crosswalk times ,
and later , the lego store is having a midnight madness sale .
you ask anyone , that &apos;s a hot date .
tempting choices , but i have something special
planned for tonight .
what can be more special than
having an adequate amount of time to cross the street
on your way to buy a tiny lego indiana jones ?
with our friends moving forward in their relationships ,
i &apos;ve decided that we should make progress in ours as well .
oh , dear lord .
two years ago , we didn &apos;t even know each other ,
and now i &apos;m in your apartment after dark .
how much faster can this thing go ?
i had a feeling you &apos;d be reluctant ,
which is why i &apos;m going to dip
into my neurobiological bag of tricks .
oh , you brain monkeys kill me . dip away .
i have devised an experiment
that i believe will increase your feelings for me
in an accelerated time frame .
and how do you propose to do that ?
uh , hope you &apos;re not thinking
about some sort of lsd thought control .
because there &apos;s only one mind @-@ expanding drug that this man enjoys ,
and that &apos;s called school .
human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up .
in your case , to your mother , superheroes , et cetera .
i &apos;m going to attempt an experiment that
will get you to transfer those feelings to me .
well , seems what &apos;s on the menu tonight
is malarkey with a big side of poppycock .
we &apos;ll see .
let &apos;s start with a little romantic dinner music , shall we ?
super mario bros.theme ?
yes .
i see what you &apos;re doing .
you &apos;re attempting to build on the work of ebbinghaus
证实了记忆是基于联想
by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game--
admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood ...
... but it won &apos;t work .
fine . there &apos;s no reason we still can &apos;t have a lovely dinner .
why don &apos;t you have a seat .
may i offer you something to drink ?
you know i don &apos;t drink .
not even ...
strawberry quik ?
i love strawberry quik .
it &apos;s my favorite pink fluid ,
narrowly beating out pepto @-@ bismol .
oh , i know .
i think it will go nicely
with what i have prepared ...
for dinner .
spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it !
just like your mommy used to make .
oh ... yummy , yummy !
we should do this more often .
uh @-@ oh .
i &apos;m sorry . i did ,
i crossed a line . i didn &apos;t mean to !
who says something like that right in the middle of sex ? !
i don &apos;t know , it just came out .
people say weird things during sex all the time .
okay , well , they sure as hell don &apos;t say that .
it was the heat of the moment .
no ,
the heat of the moment is , &quot; ooh , yeah , just like that , &quot;
not &quot; will you marry me ? &quot;
i &apos;m sorry .
just @-@ just give me another chance .
why , so you can crawl under the covers and go ,
&quot; hey , baby , want to go look for houses
in neighborhoods with good schools ? &quot;
again , i &apos;m sorry .
you know , with howard and bernadette getting married ,
i got caught up in a little wedding fever .
i take it back .
you can &apos;t take something like that back .
i mean , what are we even supposed to do now ?
okay , at some point , we &apos;ll look back
and this is going to be a funny story .
why don &apos;t we just start doing that now ?
you &apos;re kidding .
no .
hey , do you remember ...
... that time when i proposed to you in bed ?
and you were all , like , &quot; what are &lt; i &gt; you &lt; / i &gt; doing ? &quot;
that was so funny .
so funny .
it &apos;s not funny .
give it a minute .
is that a little smile i see there ?
i should go .
hey , i was thinking .
for our first dance at the wedding ,
what if we learn the final number from &lt; i &gt; dirty dancing ? &lt; / i &gt;
you &apos;re kidding .
no ,
come on .
how cool would that be ?
me running into your arms ...
you lifting me up into the air .
oh , you &apos;re in a good mood .
yeah , well , why wouldn &apos;t i be ?
you know , i &apos;m marrying the girl of my dreams ,
and i finally got my mother to agree
not to come on our honeymoon .
oh , hang on .
oh , it &apos;s nasa .
wolowitz .
oh ! hi , dave . what &apos;s up ?
no kidding . really ?
well , that &apos;s ... great news .
great , great news .
all right , i &apos;ll watch my e @-@ mail for the details .
okay , talk soon .
what &apos;s so great ?
it looks like i &apos;m going into space after all .
oh , howie , that &apos;s wonderful !
uh @-@ huh , wonderful .
what happened ? i thought they canceled your mission .
th @-@ they did .
but nasa really wants my telescope up on the space station ,
so they &apos;re putting me on an earlier launch .
when ?
a ... week from friday .
what ? we &apos;re getting married that sunday .
you &apos;re right !
i @-@ i can &apos;t go to space .
i have to get married ,
and no one can say that &apos;s not a good reason .
i &apos;ll call him back .
wait . i don &apos;t want to be the one who stands in your way .
well , too bad , you already did . it &apos;s a done deal .
oh , well . but i forgive you .
no . that &apos;s not how i want to start our marriage ,
killing your dream ?
we &apos;ll have the wedding when you get back .
but wh @-@ what about all the plans and the guests ?
we &apos;ll call them .
although my dad &apos;s gonna go a little nutso
over losing his deposits .
you &apos;re right , he is !
your dad &apos;s gonna be furious .
there &apos;s no way he &apos;s gonna let us postpone this wedding .
well , we tried .
i &apos;ll talk to him .
he won &apos;t say no to his little girl .
no ! i @-@ i should talk to him ,
man to man .
but , howie , my dad can be a bully .
he &apos;s gonna make you cancel your space flight .
we can only hope ...
that he doesn &apos;t .
bishop to queen four ,
level two .
check .
sheldon ...
knight takes bishop .
you all right ?
i &apos;m fine .
are you ?
you left your queen exposed from above ,
you trapped your knight in the corner ,
and you keep sighing and saying , &quot; why me ? &quot;
very well .
can i ask you a question about women ?
we got you that book last year .
wasn &apos;t everything in there ?
no , i &apos;m having a relationship problem with amy .
and by the way , that book gave me nightmares .
well , if it makes you feel any better ,
i screwed things up pretty good with penny .
look at us , leonard ...
engaging in the social convention of
men bellyaching about their ol &apos; ladies .
i guess we are .
so , what &apos;s going on ?
believe it or not ,
amy has embarked on a campaign
to increase my feelings for her
by making me happy .
i &apos;m sorry , that must be very difficult for you .
it &apos;s awful .
this morning , she arranged for me
to be an amtrak junior conductor for the day .
it @-@ it &apos;s usually only open to children .
she got them to make an exception .
shame on her .
they let me blow the whistle , leonard .
she &apos;s good .
i know . and it gets worse .
her efforts are causing me
to have affectionate feelings for her
at inappropriate times .
you mean , like in bed or in the shower ?
no !
would you please stop referencing that infernal book ?
for example , this morning ,
i was calculating the random motion
of virtual particles in a vacuum ,
when suddenly the particles morphed
into an image of amy &apos;s dandruff ...
... gently cascading down onto her pale ,
slightly hunched shoulders .
what has that vixen done to me , leonard ?
and how do i make it stop ?
well , if you had a physical relationship ,
i &apos;d say propose during sex .
turns out that &apos;s a real mood killer .
i assume we &apos;re talking about you now ?
yeah .
so , that &apos;s how this works ?
i complain , and then you complain ,
and no one offers any solutions ?
pretty much .
well , no wonder the women are winning .
mr. rostenkowski , are you busy ?
oh , just looking at some old pictures . come on in .
family pictures , or ... ?
h @-@ holy crap , that &apos;s a dead person .
last murder case before i retired .
how many bodies do you see there ?
careful ,
it &apos;s a trick question .
i &apos;m not sure .
nah , you &apos;ll never get it .
it &apos;s a fraction .
how about that .
anyway , sir ,
i need to talk to you about something .
walnut ?
no , thank you .
i &apos;m allergic .
oh , sure .
my partner used to have that .
he &apos;s dead now .
from nuts ?
nah , his wife shot him .
but she was nuts , so in a way ...
nice story .
anyway ,
the reason i wanted to talk to you is
nasa has moved up my launch to the international space station .
yeah , so ?
so ...
the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter .
now , i know what you &apos;re going to say--
i made a commitment to bernadette and to your family
and i &apos;ve got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here
and demanding that we postpone this thing .
well , message heard and understood .
mission canceled . thank you .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m sorry .
may i be excused ?
no , you may not .
let me tell you something .
when i first met you ...
you just gonna stand there ?
i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t know , is this going to ...
well , i should sit ...
may i be seat ... well , i &apos;ll just sit .
when i first met you ,
i didn &apos;t like you .
i &apos;m aware of that , sir .
but then you and i had some time together .
it did not get better .
right , right .
that silly beatle haircut
and ... you riding around on a red vespa ,
and you &apos;re still living at home with your mother .
to be honest , i thought bernadette chose you
to punish me .
but then i heard about your astronaut thing ,
and i realized
i judged you too fast .
maybe you are the right guy for my little girl .
oh , i am . and just so you know ,
i &apos;d still be an astronaut , even if i didn &apos;t go to space .
i &apos;ve got an i.d. card and a nasa golf shirt .
no , no , you got to go .
you can &apos;t turn down an opportunity like this .
b @-@ but what about the wedding
and all the money you put down for the reception ?
you let me worry about that .
you go up to that space station ,
and you make me proud .
um , okay .
you got a problem with that ?
all right , look , i &apos;m gonna level with you .
i &apos;m terrified about going into space .
what if i don &apos;t make it back ?
it &apos;s gonna be okay , son .
you really think so ?
of course .
a pretty girl like bernadette ...
she &apos;ll find a new guy .
off to work ?
yeah .
have a nice night .
okay , you , too .
penny , just , wait .
i &apos;ve been thinking about what i said
when we were in bed the other night .
yeah , i &apos;ve been thinking about it , too .
i noticed you never answered me .
you &apos;re right .
no .
uh , follow @-@ up . are we still dating ?
yep .
is it still weird &apos; cause i proposed ?
yep .
i have a couple more quick questions .
do you want to call me from the car ?
no !
think i played that pretty well .
hello , leonard .
what are you doing ?
we &apos;re playing doctor .
&lt; i &gt; star trek &lt; / i &gt; style .
i &apos;m in hell , leonard .
