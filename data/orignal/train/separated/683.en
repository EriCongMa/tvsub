They're running drugs through the bar, Jack.
We found narcotics and a handgun
hidden in the bilge.
Declan Porter, you're under arrest.
No. Wait! Wait! Stop. It's mine.
Marco and I are in talks
to find him a position within the company.
After what he did?
It's just smart business. Right, Nolan?
So it's official. He'she new C.E.O.
My son is very much in love with you.
Persuade him to drop his interest in Grayson Global,
And I will stand behind you every step of the way.
Your ex-fiancee just broke up with me.
A fake up?
I'd say Daniel's already thinking... make up.
That's the idea.
You realize I'm three moves away from snapping your neck?
If you do that, how will you ever reunite with your sister?
If I have to play nice with Daniel for a little while,
then it's a small price to pay.
They say the best-laid plans
often go awry.
Because no matter how detailed the preparation...
A plan will always have a weak point.
And there will always be those looking to exploit it.
To doom a plan to failure,
and the perpetrator along with it.
Where you been?
Thinking.
About the kiss.
Look, I'm sorry that you had to see that,
But it didn't mean anything.
I'm sure it did to Daniel.
You know, you asked me to trust you.
Well, you need to trust me, too.
You can't just disappear
when things get a little bit uncomfortable.
Like it or not, Daniel is the best remaining link
to the people who destroyed our families.
I didn't come here last night
to keep tabs on you and Daniel.
I came to tell you
that Helen Crowley made contact with me.
Or more accurately,
she allowed me to make contact with her.
The initiative knows who you are?
Not entirely.
Takeda's security measures seem to have held up.
They don't appear to know anything about you
or our deeper connection.
What did she want from you?
My complicity.
She... told me that Colleen was still alive.
Did she offer you proof?
No.
Then there's no reason to believe them.
They will say anything to manipulate you.
I understand that, but... look,
if--if she thinks I'm under their thumb, then--
then we've got a direct line to the initiative,
which doesn't involve you falling back in with Daniel.
Can you still contact her?
No.
Said she's gonna contact me.
Then we need to draw her out.
Your 9:00 AM-- Emily Thorne--is here.
Thank you, Grace. Send her in.
Good morning.
Morning.
I'm sorry. Was that not...
No, it's, uh--
I just thought after last night, we--
We did kiss, right? I-I didn't dream that?
Yes, and it was--it was great.
I just, um...
I just want to make sure that whatever's happening here,
that, you know, we're taking it slowly.
Yeah.
Yeah, probably a good idea.
I actually came here to talk to you
about a children's charity that I've been working with
Since 2008.
Okay. Tell me about it.
Basically, the organization assists kids in danger
of slipping through the foster care system.
If you meant what you said
about rehabilitating Grayson Global's image,
I'd like to invite your top-tier investors
to our annual wine auction.
Excuse me. This came for you.
Hand delivered with a note marked "Urgent."
Stonehaven united solutions. Who sent this?
Helen Crowley. She's holding on line two.
I gotta take this.
Um, Grace, can you give Ms. Thorne
my confidential client list?
Sure. Okay.
Thank you.
Can I call you later?
Yes. Please do.
I'll be right back with that list.
Um, Grace, do you mind if I use your phone?
Mine's out of battery.
Sure. Just dial 9 to get out.
Thank you so much.
Helen.
Hello, Daniel.
Do you have the Stonehaven prospectus in front of you?
Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.
The question is, why?
Consider it a gift.
This time next quarter,
that company is poised to triple its revenues,
only they don't know it yet.
Oh, but you do?
Why else would I recommend you acquire it?
Have the same killer instinct you showed
in assimilating Nolcorp
before someone else beats you to it.
Speaking of, have you followed up
on our previous discussion?
I did. Your hunch was right.
There are some gaps in Nolcorp's early r&d.
Ms. Thorne, here's our client list.
Yes, I will be by this afternoon
to check the flower arrangements.
Okay. Thanks.
Here you go. Hope it's helpful.
Thank you.
Victoria.
I think I have some information for you.
So you're saying the cops are the ones
who tipped off Nate and Kenny?
It's the only explanation.
They knew the police were coming,
so they moved all the drugs onto the boat to set me up.
And I played right into their hands.
I'm calling Emily for bail money.
I don't want her involved in this.
Fine. Nolan, then.
You're not spending another night here.
I don't want to drag any of our friends
into this mess, okay?
Jack, this is no time to be stubborn.
Whoever gets us the bail money
will get it back.
No prosecutor's gonna believe for one second
those drugs belong to you.
And if they trace the registration to the gun,
they're gonna find out--
that it was used to kill Kenny and Nate's father
six years ago.
And it belonged to my dad.
So, um...
this whole setup is what,
payback for what happened to their father?
You can't do
anything against the Ryans.
They will hurt you
or Declan...
or Carl.
Amanda, promise me.
Enjoy, Conrad. They're imported straight from Cuba.
That's very kind of you,
but completely unnecessary.
Yes.
Jason?
Oh, what a delight.
Victoria, it's been too long.
What brings you out to the Hamptons?
Good sportsmanship.
It appears my 20-year rivalry with your husband
has come to an end.
Uh, Jason brought by a box of cubans
to commemorate my retirement.
Is that what they call corporate exile these days?
Oh, trust me.
I'm only too happy to be done with the private sector.
And what does the public sector promise,
a run for office?
Perhaps.
Just when I thought
I had the biggest ego in the tristate area.
I'm sorry.
Conrad, may I have a word alone with you?
Gladly.
Jason, please excuse us.
I know. I know. The man is an ogre.
That's what I get for opening my own door.
I could care less
about your petty rivalry with Jason Prosser.
I am concerned with Helen Crowley.
Apparently, she directed our son to acquire a company
called Stonehaven United Solutions.
Does that mean anything to you?
Stonehaven is a disaster recovery firm, if memory serves.
This, dear, is what the Initiative does.
They influence upheaval and then profit in the aftermath.
Aftermath of what,
another flight 197?
How did you happen upon this little morsel?
While you're busy debating your bid for political office,
I have been securing alliances
close to Daniel
that will help ensure the future of this family.
And if you're not going to do anything
to thwart these devils, I will.
And how do you intend to do that?
Sabotage.
第二季第十一集
Thank you for the Stonehaven tip, Emily.
Of course. Is it significant?
It's hard to say just yet.
But to that end,
I'm not sure how including Daniel
in your upcoming charity auction would convince him
to abandon his post at Grayson Global.
I know. I'm afraid that was in the works
before we had our conversation,
and it's hard to turn a ship on a dime.
Ah, well, c'est la guerre.
As long as you're going through with it,
might I suggest that you invite Jason Prosser to the event?
Jason Prosser of Prosser Wealth Funds?
Oh, you know of him?
Of course, but isn't he one of Grayson Global's
biggest competitors?
Yes.
Men like Conrad and Jason
judge their manhood by the size of their wallets.
And it's always been my experience
that the most lucrative charity auctions
are the ones that pit
two corporate egos against each other.
With your permission,
I'm sure I could get Jason to attend.
Permission granted.
Declan. Amanda.
I'm guessing by the faces,
our boy Jack's still in the penalty box.
Thanks to you setting him up.
I mean, what the hell do you guys want?
Can we just get it out?
Hey, settle down, kid.
You want out? That's simple.
You just sell us the rest of the bar.
In fact, uh, that should cover it right there.
Hey, this is our home, you son of a bitch.
We're not going anywhere.
Declan, easy.
You probably need your big bro's signature
to make it official anyway, so I tell you what--
Why don't you get back to us in about, mm,
10 to 15 years when he gets out, okay?
He's just shooting his mouth off.
He does that.
When he's not planting drugs or guns
on our boat, you mean?
Don't play innocent with me.
Take my advice, okay?
Go along to get along.
I don't want any more trouble for you guys.
I think you know what you can do with your advice, Kenny.
I read through the tech report you provided
of everything Nolcorp has in development.
Impressive, right?
Incomplete, actually.
There were significant resources allocated
between 2004 and 2006 to a project
that's vanished from the books.
Something called Carrion.
Look, Daniel, not all our R&D yields viable products.
Well, whatever it did yield could be sold off
to recoup our losses.
Unless you're hiding something from me.
I'm not hiding anything from you.
But it has always been my rule
to keep failed development in house.
Well, everything we do incorporates bits and pieces--
Well, there are new rules now, Nolan,
full disclosure being one of them.
Now I want a report
detailing all of your abandoned development,
and I want it by the end of the week.
What was that about?
My guess?
Extreme daddy issues.
Had enough time away?
I've been thinking,
and... I was never qualified
to be your C.F.O. in the first place,
so I don't care about losing my position.
But I care about you.
And if you'll have me,
I'd like to come back to work.
Padma...
You're smart.
There are so many better opportunities out there.
Unless those opportunities
have an office down the hall with you in it,
I'm not interested.
Okay. You're hired.
Again.
Hired to what capacity exactly?
You know, let's not get all territorial.
I'm sure we can find room for our former C.F.O.
We found room for you, didn't we?
Of course.
We'll figure something out.
Welcome. Welcome back.
He's not happy.
Neither am I.
I don't have a date for
Emily's charity wine auction tomorrow night.
Any ideas?
Conrad.
Ms. Davenport. Well, I knew you had moxie,
but showing your face back here so soon,
if I weren't so intrigued, I'd be shocked.
I'm here to protect an investment.
And what investment would that be?
My time whilst in your family's employ.
I believe I may still be owed a few dividends.
Blackmail.
Of course.
Is there anything that isn't beneath you?
I don't want hush money.
The truth is, it would be unwise for me
to start over in a place
where my ability to hold any number of secrets
might not be as valued as it is in the Grayson fold.
Oh, well, in case you hadn't noticed,
my traitorous son now sits atop my former throne,
in no small part to your assistance.
So as it stands,
I'm hardly in a position
to rehire you in your former capacity.
We can look at this either of two ways.
I know where the bodies are buried,
proverbial and otherwise.
I've been privy to all manner of chicanery,
from fictional kidnappings to inflated investor returns.
And the other way, Ms. Davenport?
Quite simply, I am good at what I do.
And whilst your family breathes,
there will be a demand for my talents.
You do realize you're asking to reenter Victoria's orbit.
Well, as per my terms,
all of which are nonnegotiable,
the dragon lady is yours to wrangle.
Well, serendipity prevails...
Ms. Davenport.
You see, these talents you speak of
make you particularly well-suited
to assist in my next endeavor.
So we have a deal?
You might call it that.
Well done.
The net worth on this guest list
exceeds the G.D.P. of most small countries.
Well, I don't like to take "No" for an answer.
That makes the two of us.
There is, however, one client of yours
that I'm having trouble nailing down--
Um... Helen Crowley.
Aiden mentioned something about meeting her
at one of your investor luncheons this summer.
You invited Aiden?
No. I invited Aiden's boss.
Aiden R.S.V.P.'d.
But if he's willing to contribute to the cause,
I can't say no.
Daniel grayson.
Ms. Crowley,
Hello.
Evening, Daniel.
I, uh, I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
No, not at all.
Just dinner with my colleague Emily Thorne.
She's a consultant for our philanthropic concerns.
Uh, in fact, she'd love a word with you if that's okay.
Helen, you're on with Emily.
So nice to meet you.
And you, too, ms. Crowley.
Listen, I know how valuable your time is, so...
I'll get right to it.
I'm hosting a charity wine auction tomorrow night.
Well, I imagine Daniel's told you
that I'm a-a very private person.
I don't make a habit of going to parties.
Oh, well, I was hoping you would make an exception.
You see, our charity supports foster kids
who have aged out of the system.
They have nowhere to go, no guidance.
It can be a really scary time for them.
And... well, the more deep pockets in attendance,
The better it reflects on daniel as the new C.E.O.
I like the way you think.
Perhaps I can put in an appearance.
Terrific.
I'll put you on the V.I.P. List.
If all your consultants are this tenacious, Daniel,
I predict good things for your future.
Go back to your meeting. I'll call later.
Very impressive, Ms. Thorne.
I had a curious conversation
with Daniel Grayson recently.
He was inquiring...
about our early software development.
That seems like a standard inquiry.
He just wants to assure fiscal transparency.
Oh, I think it was more calculated than that.
He was inquiring about Carrion.
There's no way he could've happened upon that information, so...
somebody must have tipped him off.
And you think it was me?
You were the one that dusted carrion off and put her on my desk.
I did that to remind you
of the greatness you're capable of.
Nolan, I'm trying to--
to rebuild the trust you once had in me,
not destroy it.
Look, I wanna...
believe you, Marco.
I do.
But, uh, you can see why that might be difficult.
Okay, I'll tell you what I see.
Right before daniel comes snooping around,
a certain girl conveniently shows back up into your life?
You know, I seem to remember you coming back into my life
in exactly the same fashion.
The only difference being that I lost my whole company
to Grayson Global the day you did.
And you know how sorry I am about that.
Look, at some point,
we are gonna have to put this behind us.
Did I tell you how beautiful you look in that dress?
Twice, actually.
Well, what can I say?
Some things are worth repeating.
Master Grayson.
Jason Prosser, what a surprise.
Nice to see you, Daniel.
And congrats on the Nolcorp coup.
Aggressive play.
Your old man never could've put that deal to bed so quickly.
Don't be so sure.
Whatever acumen I have for the job
I owe to my father.
He was my mentor.
And now he's not even an employee.
Who is this lovely lady?
Emily thorne.
Uh, I'm so happy you could make it, Mr. Prosser.
I'm sorry. I-I thought you two knew each other.
Actually, your mother invited me this evening.
And you better have brought your checkbook.
Victoria, aren't you a vision?
Ah, among other things.
Hello, you two.
I have to say how happy it makes me to see you together again.
Jason, you'll be pleased to know
that I had the bar stocked
with the oldest japanese whiskey known to mankind.
Come.
What was that about?
The rivalry between my dad and Prosser is legendary.
She probably invited him here
to embarrass me on the auction block.
I'm gonna get a refill.
Looks like "Faux-mance: Part Deux" is a runaway success.
How's your other boyfriend handling it?
As well as can be expected.
Oh, look at you, all gussied up like 007, again.
So what do you got for us today, Q.?
Well, per moneypenny's request,
I've taken the building's utility network wireless.
This NolPad controls all its system.
Mood lighting, anyone?
Perfect. Good to have you on the team.
I'm gonna find out what's keeping my date.
So... you think Helen's gonna make an appearance?
No question.
I'm convinced she has daniel's office wired.
She'll come because she's curious.
Curious about what?
You.
I led her to believe that
you're the one that suggested that she come tonight.
Right.
Aiden,are you ready for this?
You seem distracted.
Anything but. On with the show.
They want the bar,Jack.
And Nate offered $1.
Not for a million dollars are they getting the bar from us.
I know. That's what I said, but...
you know,what I can't figure out
is why they want it so bad in the first place.
It's time you knew the truth.
And declan won't answer my phone calls.
It's as if I did something wrong.
Did I do something wrong?
This isn't about you.
Declan's just trying to keep you safe.
From the Ryan brothers?
They're the ones behind everything
that's been happening at the Stowaway,
from Matt Duncan getting beaten half to death
to Jack being framed for drug trafficking.
Well,what can we do?
Go to your parents.
My parents? Why?
If the Ryan brothers want money,
I've got plenty of my own.
It isn't about money.
It's about power and influence.
Your mother's on record saying
she'd do anything for me.
My mother isn't exactly known for living up to her word.
My father,on the other hand, owes me big-time.
$50,000. Going once.
Twice. Sold.
Congratulations to Aiden Mathis of Takeda industries.
Uh,thank you. And let me assure you that Mr. Takeda
will be enjoying this bottle personally.
Thank you.
And now for our final item of tonight's auction--
The belle of the ball-a 1945 chateau d'huet.
We'll start the bidding off at a modest $10,000.
$10,000. Thank you. Do I have $20,000?
Thank you. Who will give me $25,000?
Do I have $25,000?
$25,000. $50,000? Do I hear $50,000?
We have a bid for $50,000.
Do I hear $60,000?
$100,000.
$100,000 from Mr. Grayson.
Do I hear $150,000? $150,000?
You haven't lost your nerve,have you,Jason?
The economy's not that bad.
Do I hear $150,000?
$200,000.
$200,000 from Mr. Prosser.
Hell,make it half a mil.
And I don't even drink wine.
$500,000 from Mr. Ross.
Do I hear $600,000?
$600,000.
$700,000.
$750,000.
$750,000. Do I hear $800,000?
$800,000. Thank you. Do I hear $850,000?
$850,000.
$850,000.
Do I hear--
$1 million.
$1 million from Mr. Grayson.
Is anyone willing to go higher?
A million going once.
Going twice.
Sold to Mr. Daniel Grayson. Congratulations.
Mr. Grayson,congratulations.
Thank you.
That was great.
Thank you so much.
Did you just invite me here to make your boy seem less...
boyish in front of his investors?
No, Jason.
I invited you here because I enjoy your company.
Well,if that's true,
perhaps we could continue this conversation
somewhere a little more private.
Well,then. Let's have another round.
But the terrace is private enough.
Daniel.
Helen,you made it.
Sorry I'm late.
Is the auction...
it's finished.
You missed a good show.
Bidding got quite spirited towards the end there.
Oh,what a shame. I did so want to contribute.
I'm sorry. Have you two met?
Aiden Mathis,Helen Crowley.
Aiden...
Mathis.
Oh,pleasure.
Oh,excuse me. I think it's time to pay the piper.
Yes.
I was hoping you'd make an appearance.
Really? Hope is so inactive.
And it seems to me you went to great lengths
to get me here tonight--
Employing Daniel's ex-fiancee to reach me on your behalf.
Oh,the tangled web we weave,Mr. Mathis.
I just want to see my sister.
Well,we'll talk later.
Then I'm at your service.
What do you suppose those two are chatting about?
Think Aiden's starting to hedge his bets?
That's a very good question.
1-0-0-0-0-0-0.
I never thought giving away a million bucks
could feel so good.
I assume your charity accepts simple donations as well.
How kind of you.
You must be Emily.
Helen Crowley.
Helen.
How wonderful to finally put a face to the name.
It sure is.
Though I am sorry to say,I was just on my way out.
Oh,well,you mustn't leave empty-handed.
Let me find you a bottle of wine.
No,I don't drink. It clouds my judgment.
Well... Thank you for your generosity.
I should probably go
settle up with the caterers and the vintners.
It might take a little while so--
How--how about a drink later,just you and me?
Sure.
Lovely to meet you,Helen.
You,too,Emily.
So I vetted Stonehaven United,
and I'm not bullish on their financials.
Well,like this,I know it's a worthy cause.
My recommendation stands.
Daniel... Indecision is a sign of weakness in a leader,
and you need to be better than
your father in every facet.
You buy that company now so you don't regret it later.
Good night.
You're asking me to seriously question
the integrity of a police investigation
based on the word of the accused and the mother of his child?
Daddy,you of all people should understand.
You've been framed just like Jack.
Uh,the difference being,
I was 100% certain of my innocence.
Now if Declan would like a safe harbor
until this storm passes,
He's more than welcome to stay here.
But as for your baby daddy, Ms. Clarke,
I hope you can respect
that I have to act more prudently with regard
to the influence my name affords me.
Your wife publicly welcomed me into your family.
I nearly died in this house and I didn't ask for anything.
Oh, no, you did attempt to extort a rather large chunk of money
in exchange for your father's diary.
Did you not?
Let me be frank here.
I don't like that your return has drawn Charlotte
into an orbit of drugs,crime,and the threat of violence.
So I would appreciate it if, going forward,
you would keep your distance from us.
That's not gonna be a problem.
Good.
I must say that Clarke girl is a lost cause.
Did you hear any of that?
Enough to know that if you're seriously considering
a career shift towards politics,
then you're missing an enormous opportunity.
Nolan.
Padma. Hey,I was just headed out.
Sorry. I know I'm late.
I would've been here earlier
if Marco hadn't thrown a bunch of work at me.
Strong move. Why the face?
I'm sure it's nothing, but earlier tonight,
I overheard Marco on the phone with Daniel Grayson.
They were talking about someone named Carrie Ann something.
The way he was talking gave me this paranoid thought
that he and Daniel might be trying
to bring in hand-picked personnel to undermine you,
Padma,I-I really--I want to talk to you about this,
but,uh,I am in the middle of... a deal.
Can you meet me back at the office in an hour?
Okay,but I...
Thanks.
You look beautiful!
Permission to come aboard?
Charlotte, I'm sorry.
I should've called you back. I just...
It's okay.
I know you were just trying to keep me out of danger.
Now it's my turn to return the favor.
Amanda told you about the Ryans?
Listen,my dad said you can come stay at our house
until this whole mess is resolved.
I gotta stay put.
I got to. No one is coming in here
and just ripping away everything my dad worked so hard to give us.
And,hey,if Jack and I are going down,
it's not gonna be without one hell of a fight.
How much for the 9 millimeter?
All yours for $350.
This is worth five times that,at least.
My lucky day.
Room for one more?
I'm more than a little
curious how it is you know so much about me.
Well,other than your rampage against Dmitri Bladov,
we know very little.
You pulled quite the vanishing act in the ensuing years.
Try the phone.
It's dead.
Yeah, no reception.
Do you hear that?
Get down on the floor. Now.
What can I say, Vic?
I hate to lose. Always have.
You did outbid Conrad for
that beautiful Aston Martin a few years ago.
Yes, but at the time,
I was coveting something far more beautiful.
Truth is, I meant to impress you tonight.
Unfortunately,
Grayson Global's brash new C. E. O.
proved a more formidable opponent than I was prepared for.
Oh, well, get used to it.
With the takeover of Nolcorp,
Daniel's developed deep pockets and a big ego.
And soon, he's going to be adding a new feather in the company cap
with the acquisition of Stonehaven United.
Stonehaven? Interesting.
Oh,my God.
Jason, that's not public knowledge. Loose lips.
Victoria,please. It's already forgotten.
The only thing on my mind this evening is you.
Well, I have to make the long ride home.
Don't tell me I'm gonna lose you,too.
On the contrary.
You're still very much in the race.
I want M&A together first thing.
The target is Stonehaven United Solutions.
What is your interest in Stonehaven United?
Don't say anything.
As long as you know what they need to know,
they won't kill you.
Bad advice.
Next time the chamber will be loaded.
Who hired you to spy on Daniel Grayson?
Go to hell.
Wrong answer.
Let's get this party started.
What do you want?
To give you a chance...
which is more than you deserve.
Oh, yeah? A chance to what?
To get outta here before you bleed.
Either you and your brother pack it up and leave tonight...
Or what,hmm?
Or you're gonna wish you'd taken me up on my offer.
Amanda. I've been calling you.
Excuse us.
Yeah.
Ashley,what are you doing here?
Jack's upstairs. He's waiting for you.
Jack.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Oh, baby.
What happened?
Mr. Grayson here made some kind of deal with the court.
They dropped the charges?
No. Uh,my co-chair on the,uh,
on the liberty project is friendly with the judge,
So I just called in a favor.
And I asked the judge to set a lenient bail.
What made you change your mind?
Oh, well, I don't know. You know, as a citizen of some influence,
I felt it was my duty to clean up police corruption
and drug trafficking in my own backyard.
And as a father, I was concerned about my daughter...
and her sister.
Cut the crap. What's in it for you?
Amanda.
No, no, no. That's all right.
She has every right to be suspicious about my motives.
And, yes, Ms. Clarke,
I came to my senses and realized
that your predicament is my opportunity.
Mr. Grayson has decided to run for public office,
and I suggested that helping you
and cleaning up police corruption in Montauk
would be beneficial towards restoring his public profile.
That is, of course, if you'll accept my help
and my apology.
Can we get a couple minutes?
Of course. Yeah.
Take all the time you need.
The only way to leave here alive is to cooperate.
You're wasting your time.
Cooperate, and they'll kill you.
Fine. You first.
You okay?
Yeah.
Quickly. Let's go.
Wait.
No, now!
Brava.
Well, let's see if she buys it.
We need to split up. Do you have a car nearby?
Uh, not far.
Who were those guys?
I have my suspicions.
Good-bye, Mr. Mathis.
You guys are back early.
What, your big date flame out?
Better question--
What are you doing here so late?
This is when I get my best work done.
Oh, would that be your work... or Daniel's?
Okay. This again.
Nolan, what--what do I have to say to you?
What--what can I do?
You can stop embarrassing yourself.
Every move that you've made since you've come back
has been about undermining me.
What have you been telling him?
The truth, a concept that...
continues to elude you.
Check my E-mails.
Check my E-mails. Check every last communication I have made
since I started working here again.
Don't mind if I do.
And since you would've never run it through standard E-mail...
It would have to be a ghost.
Not unlike this one, sent to Daniel's personal E-mail.
"Subject--missing R&D.
"N. R. will deny it ever existed.
Don't take no for an answer. "
It's the ghosts that get you.
Nolan, look, I swear to you, I did not-- I did not write that.
Look...
Get out. Forever.
You're making a very big mistake.
How'd we do?
Brilliant.
It was Oscar-worthy.
Helen's on the hook?
Well, I'm still alive, aren't I?
Look, we should,um... we should celebrate.
Oh, Aiden, I would love to, but...
I'm expecting company.
Emily, if--if our plan tonight worked,
you shouldn't have to keep up this charade with Daniel.
Well, if it works.
Until we know for sure, we stay the course.
And don't worry. I'll control the situation with Daniel.
Fair enough.
Every plan has a fatal flaw.
Emily?
Sometimes it's the heart...
How about a $1-million nightcap?
even in those who are supposed to be the most careful.
But a careful nature doesn't always ensure success.
When a plan is built on an unstable foundation...
failure is not only a possibility,
it's a certainty.
I can't believe you're opening this with me.
Ah, live for the moment, right?
Besides, you're worth it.
What shall we toast to?
Taking it slow and drinking it quickly.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, it's gone bad.
Oh, my goodness.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, what the hell? It's for a good cause.
Aiden.
Excuse me.
I think I can guess what you're doing here.
Yeah, I saw the lights were on.
Uh, I thought I'd fetch my things.
Daniel.
Aiden.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
No, not really. Um, it's fine.
Here.
Here.
I'll, uh, just take it that that's everything, then.
It is. Trust me.
Okay. Night.
Sorry.
No, I should--I should get going, too.
Thank you for the wine, really.
That was a lovely gesture.
Yeah. Maybe we should quit while we're behind...
for now.
Yes.
It's me.
I have an update.
I have confirmation Nolan Ross
is hiding the Carrion program somewhere inside the company.
Good. We're counting on you.
