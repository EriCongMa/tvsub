so , pheebs , i was just at this bachelorette party ...
... and they had a cake that was in the shape of a man &apos;s ...
... thing @-@ a @-@ ding @-@ ding .
and i was wondering , what would you have thought of that ?
offensive or amusing ?
i &apos;m not sure . monica , what do you think ?
sounds kind of tacky .
damn it .
i &apos;ll see if they can cancel it . if not , maybe they can put eyes on the &quot; hoojies ... &quot;
... and we &apos;ll just say it &apos;s just some sort of weird elephant .
guys , you won &apos;t believe this !
i just talked to my agent ...
oh , my god !
i &apos;m sorry . too soon . you go .
i got nominated for days of our lives !
good for you !
congratulations !
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re nominated for an emmy !
soap opera digest award ?
nope . i &apos;m up for a &quot; soapie . &quot;
is that something you &apos;re making up ?
no , no , no , it &apos;s real ! and it has been , since 1998 .
okay , they said they won &apos;t cancel the cake ...
... but i was thinking we could write &quot; nasa &quot; on the side ...
and then give it to ross .
okay . yeah .
hey , rach ! i &apos;m up for a soapie !
oh , my god !
oh , my god ! that &apos;s the third most prestigious soap opera award there is !
thank you ! i guess we know who i &apos;ll take to the awards !
don &apos;t kid about that ! will all the stars be there ?
many are scheduled to appear .
i can &apos;t go . i &apos;ll be too nervous !
i &apos;ll go .
you &apos;re getting married . this is all i have .
we should celebrate .
yes ! and we will get you a cake ...
... in the shape of a microphone .
with two tennis balls .
the one with joey &apos;s award
ernest muhlbrat hypothesized that the velociraptor , when threatened ...
... would expand its collar and emit a high @-@ pitched noise ...
... to frighten off predators .
mr. lewis ?
what kind of noise ?
just a high @-@ pitched , intimidating noise .
but like how ?
well , we don &apos;t know for sure .
but in my head , it sounded something like this :
of course , this is just conjecture .
okay . that &apos;s all for today .
mr. morse , can i see you for a moment ?
yes , sir ?
i need to talk to you about your midterm exam .
i &apos;m afraid i had to fail you .
why ?
well , you need 60 % to pass .
what did i get ?
seven .
that &apos;s not so good .
no , no , it &apos;s not . what happened , ned ?
maybe you can cut me some slack . i &apos;m sort of in love .
i &apos;m sorry , but that &apos;s really not my problem .
i &apos;m in love with you .
that brings me in the loop a little .
that &apos;s why i did so bad on this test . i &apos;m having a hard time concentrating .
when you &apos;re up there and you &apos;re teaching ...
... and your face gets all serious ...
you look so good . when you wear that tight little turtleneck sweater ...
i &apos;m your teacher . i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re a student .
and i like women .
in spite of what may be written on the backs of these chairs .
that guy at the counter &apos;s totally checking you out .
really ?
oh , my god , he &apos;s really cute !
go for it .
phoebe , i &apos;m engaged .
i &apos;m saying , get his number , just in case .
but if chandler &apos;s in an accident and can &apos;t perform sexually ...
... he &apos;d want you to take a lover to satisfy needs he &apos;d no longer fulfill .
can i just tell you something ?
i &apos;m very flattered , but i &apos;m engaged .
this is kind of embarrassing .
i actually came over to talk to your friend .
you should be embarrassed .
i thought you knew i looked at you .
i did , but that was really fun .
&quot; the winner is ... joey tribbiani ! &quot;
&quot; i honestly never expected this .
i didn &apos;t prepare a speech .
i &apos;d like to thank my parents , who &apos;ve always been there for me .
also like to thank my friends , chandler , monica , phoebe , rachel ... &quot;
i &apos;m fourth ?
jeez !
look at you with your maple syrup award !
maybe you don &apos;t tell anyone about this ?
no big deal . i do that with my shampoo bottle .
really ?
yeah .
what award are you practicing for ?
grammy .
for best new artist .
the soapies people called today . i also get to present an award .
so you &apos;ll get on stage even if you don &apos;t win .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;ll win ?
of course i do .
but favorite returning character ? that &apos;s a tough category .
you &apos;re up against the guy who survived his own cremation .
no , i know i might not win . but it &apos;s just ...
i &apos;ve never been nominated . i want it so much .
you &apos;ll probably get it .
but you should start practicing your &quot; gracious @-@ loser &quot; face .
when the cameras are on you , you want to look disappointed .
but also that your colleague deserved to win . like :
you know ?
you practice losing the grammys too ?
no , at the grammys , i always win .
hey , mon . this woman only had two bites of her steak .
want me to wrap it up for your dog ?
oh , yeah .
what &apos;s your dog &apos;s name again ?
joey .
hey !
how &apos;d your date go with jake ?
great . we couldn &apos;t keep our eyes off each other .
every once in a while , he &apos;d lean over , stroke my hair , then touch my neck .
stop it . you &apos;re getting me all tingly .
all i could think of was , is he gonna kiss me ?
did he ?
i &apos;m a lady . i don &apos;t kiss and tell .
but this hickey speaks for itself .
okay , i got it . i got it .
i like him so much , i feel like i &apos;ve had 10 drinks today .
i &apos;ve only had six .
i haven &apos;t had that feeling since i first went out with chandler .
i &apos;ll never have that feeling again .
you sound like a guy .
no , a guy would say , &quot; i &apos;ll never get to sleep with anyone else . &quot;
i &apos;ll never sleep with anyone else !
are you just realizing this now ?
no . maybe . yes !
i &apos;m so busy planning the wedding , i forgot about what i &apos;ll give up .
i &apos;ll never have a first kiss again .
you &apos;ll have a last kiss .
can i ask you something ? has a guy ever had a crush on you ?
is that why you wanted to tie my tie ?
a kid in my class said he &apos;s in love with me .
whoa !
whoa , what ?
ross has a boyfriend !
i do not have a boyfriend .
there &apos;s a guy in one of my classes who has a crush on me .
really ?
yeah .
last year , elizabeth , now this kid ...
what is it ? am i giving out some kind of ...
... sexy @-@ professor vibe ?
not right now .
the point is , my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm .
now i feel bad for the kid .
i had a crush on a teacher once , and it was so hard .
i couldn &apos;t concentrate . i blushed every time he looked at me .
you remember what it &apos;s like to be 19 and in love .
i can cut him some slack .
yeah .
how &apos;d you get over that teacher ?
i didn &apos;t . i got under him .
problem solved .
bye , phoebe .
okay , bye .
all right . bye .
bye .
bye !
bye !
i &apos;ll miss you !
i &apos;ll miss you too !
we said goodbye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love .
it &apos;s okay . you don &apos;t have to tiptoe around me .
i &apos;ve thought about it . you know what ?
i &apos;m okay , not having that new @-@ relationship feeling .
i miss you already !
i miss you too !
that &apos;s great , but i wouldn &apos;t trade what i have for that .
i &apos;ll be with chandler the rest of my life . that makes me happy .
come sit down . we &apos;re talking about how our relationship &apos;s deep ...
... and meaningful . it is , don &apos;t you think ?
oh , totally .
pull my finger .
okay , everybody , we &apos;re back in 30 .
where have you been ? they &apos;re about to give out my award .
oh , well , i was in the bathroom , and susan lucci came out of a stall ...
... and she had toilet paper on her shoe , so i took it .
favorite returning male ...
this is my category !
got your speech ?
got my speech .
got your gracious @-@ loser face ?
try to remember , if you win , you have to hug me .
can i squeeze your ass ?
on tv ?
yeah !
they say you can &apos;t go home again ...
... but these four exceptional actors have proven that this is not always the case .
in the favorite returning male character category , the nominees are :
john wheeler from general hospital .
gavin graham from the young and the restless .
duncan harrington from passions .
and joey tribbiani from days of our lives .
and the soapie goes to :
gavin graham from the young and the restless .
what the ... ? !
presenting the favorite supporting actress award :
joey tribbiani from days of our lives .
any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award ...
... deserves to take it home . unfortunately , only one can .
the nominees for favorite supporting actress are :
from passions , erin goff .
from one life to live , mary lauren bishop . all my children , sarah renee .
and from days of our lives , jessica ashley .
and the winner is :
jessica ashley from days of our lives .
unfortunately , jessica couldn &apos;t be with us tonight ...
... so i &apos;ll accept this award on her behalf .
and i &apos;m sure that jessica ...
... wants to thank my parents ...
... who always believed in me .
she &apos;d also like to thank my friends :
chandler , monica , ross , phoebe and rachel ...
... who &apos;s sitting right there .
why &apos;d we rush out so fast ?
i was this close to getting luke and laura to sign susan lucci &apos;s toilet paper .
we had to get out of there because ... look what i won !
oh , my god . you stole her award !
no , no , no . i &apos;m accepting it on her behalf .
i don &apos;t think you know what &quot; behalf &quot; means .
sure i do . it &apos;s a verb . as in &quot; i be half it &quot; !
you &apos;ve got to take this back .
i should &apos;ve won . i really wanted it .
she didn &apos;t care enough to come to the thing . it could also be a grammy .
no , joey .
no one saw me take it . there &apos;s a whole table of them .
do you want an award you didn &apos;t win ?
no , i want an award i did win . but nobody &apos;s given me any of those !
if i put it up , when people come over , they &apos;ll see it ...
... and think i won it .
joey , it says &quot; best supporting actress . &quot;
i can scratch that right off .
this is wrong . you have to take it back .
you don &apos;t want to win an award this way.you &apos;re very talented .
someday you &apos;ll win one of these for real and that one will mean something .
oh , all right .
all right ? thank you .
i &apos;ll take it back tomorrow .
thank you .
if i can &apos;t have it , you can &apos;t have it !
professor geller ?
yes , mr. lewis ? how can i help you ?
i know i didn &apos;t do well on my midterms and stuff .
but i was hoping you could change my grade .
and why , exactly , would i do that ?
because i &apos;m in love with you .
what ?
yeah . i &apos;m all in love with you and stuff .
so could you change my grade ?
no !
why not ? you changed ned &apos;s grade .
that &apos;s different . because he was actually in love with me .
no , he &apos;s not ! he &apos;s totally yanking your chain .
he &apos;s done this with three other teachers .
what ?
he &apos;s got a girlfriend .
i can &apos;t believe someone would do that for a grade .
i know .
it &apos;s awful .
i love you .
all right .
what ? it &apos;s true .
oh , god ... okay .
oh , you love me ? you love me ?
all right , fine . you love me so much , come over here and give me a kiss .
you got an 80 ! you didn &apos;t even fail ! have some self @-@ respect !
have you seen chandler ?
no , why ?
i keep thinking about all the things i won &apos;t have .
it &apos;s freaking me out . i don &apos;t know what to do .
don &apos;t sweat it .
chandler &apos;s not around , so get it out of your system . that guy &apos;s cute .
come on , i &apos;m serious .
i &apos;ve got to talk to him about this .
that &apos;s the last thing you want to do .
why ?
because you &apos;re marrying him !
you gotta help me out here .
i &apos;ve never been engaged . i &apos;ve never really been married .
i can only tell you what my mother told me .
when you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship ...
... don &apos;t communicate them to your husband .
i &apos;m not supposed to share my doubts and fears ...
... with the guy i &apos;m spending the rest of my life with ?
that is correct . yes .
you &apos;re supposed to put all that stuff in a little box in your mind ...
... and lock it up .
your mother told you this ?
yes .
the woman who married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13 ?
oh , my god , you &apos;re right .
tell chandler . hurry , before it &apos;s too late !
wait ! does this also mean that putting out doesn &apos;t get you love ?
i &apos;m gonna meet jessica ashley !
wait , wait .
rach , please be cool , okay ? i work with this woman .
okay , i &apos;m totally cool .
come in .
hey , jessica .
hey , jess .
this is my friend rachel .
hi .
what &apos;s up ?
here &apos;s your soapie . i accepted it for you .
oh , my god . i won ? do you have any idea what this means ?
you &apos;re not gonna put it on your shelf or anything ?
no , i try to save that for real awards . now if you &apos;ll excuse me ?
take it back ?
absolutely .
yeah , you do !
honey ? as we get closer to the wedding ...
... is there anything you &apos;d like to share ?
okay . i think the centerpieces are too big .
you &apos;re wrong . the centerpieces are fine .
do you ever get scared at all ?
kind of . they &apos;re really big .
doesrt it freak you out that you &apos;ll never be with anybody new again ?
what ?
i love you so much .
sometimes it bothers me that i &apos;ll never have that feeling .
when you first meet someone ...
... and it &apos;s new and exciting . you know that rush ?
no , when i first meet somebody ...
... it &apos;s mostly panic , anxiety and a great deal of sweating .
okay . but you &apos;re a guy .
arert you freaked out that you &apos;ll never sleep with anybody else ?
sleeping with somebody , no .
anxiety , panic and , i &apos;m afraid , even more sweating .
even with me ?
i was dangerously dehydrated the first six months of our relationship .
for me , the rush is knowing that we &apos;ll be together the rest of our lives .
really ?
well , yeah .
knowing you &apos;re having these thoughts , we &apos;re back to panic , anxiety and ...
... l &apos;ll definitely need some kind of sports drink .
come here . oh , you don &apos;t have to worry .
besides , you know what ? i &apos;ll have a lot of new things with you .
the first time we buy a house . our first kid . our first grandkid .
water . water . water .
mr. morse ? can i speak to you for a moment ?
that was a great lecture today . did you get a little haircut ?
yeah , yeah . do you like it ? do you love it ?
i want you to know i &apos;m changing your grade back .
what ? why ?
i know what you &apos;re trying to pull here . it won &apos;t work .
i &apos;m not trying to pull anything . look , i love you , dude .
i &apos;m not even gonna talk about this . this little &quot; thing &quot; is over .
i know you have a girlfriend . and i know about the other professors .
how do you think that makes me feel ? you used me !
you don &apos;t love me and you never did !
professor winston . professor frederickson .
i &apos;ll be right with you .
don &apos;t make this worse and i &apos;ll give you a &quot; c. &quot; shall we ?
i &apos;ll be out in a second .
&quot; it &apos;s just so unexpected !
