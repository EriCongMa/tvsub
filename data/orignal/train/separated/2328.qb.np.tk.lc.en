for over a cecentury , i &apos;ve living in secret until now .
i know the risk , but i have to know her .
elena , she &apos;s a dead ringer for katherine .
hello , brother .
damon .
there &apos;s nothin &apos; about that logan guy
i killed in here .
someone &apos;s coverin &apos; it up .
it &apos;s a small circle , founding families ,
few city officials .
i of course will do anything i can to help .
alaric saltzman .
i &apos;m your new history teacher .
that &apos;s a cool ring .
thanks . it was my father &apos;s .
i have to leave . too many people have died .
i can &apos;t be a part of your life anymore .
don &apos;t go , stefan .
good bye , elena .
you know what ? i &apos;m not gonna invite you in .
some other time , then .
i was dumped .
yeah , well , logan &apos;s a jerk .
hello , jenna .
logan .
aren &apos;t you gonna invite me in ?
why are you here , logan ?
i missed you .
i was out of town .
yeah . i got that e @-@ mail .
you got an e @-@ mail ?
you didn &apos;t send an e @-@ mail ?
i can explain . juit in , and
i &apos;ll tell you everything .
i &apos;m not gonna invite you in . forget it .
come on , jenna . it &apos;s me .
the answer &apos;s no .
i know you .
you &apos;re always one step from a maybe ,
a tiny nudge to yes .
heh . you just pointed out that i have no self @-@ control .
clever strategy .
evening .
you &apos;re that guy from the news , logan fell .
i watch you every night .
well , i used to . i mean , you &apos;ve been missing from my tv .
i took some time off .
i noticed .
i &apos;m daphne .
hey , you know somethin &apos; , daphne ?
no. what ?
the vampire diaries s01e10
&quot; i live in fear . &quot;
&quot; it consumes me .
&quot; in the early evening when i see the sun begin to fade ,
&quot; the fear comes , &quot;
&quot; because i know that the night brings death . &quot;
jeremy &apos;s got his sketch pad out .
you &apos;re kidding .
nope , but don &apos;t say a word .
the minute we encourage him , he &apos;ll put it away .
psychology major . check that .
you and stefan ?
update ?
he knows how i feel and where i stand ,
and i know where he stands , but it doesn &apos;t matter .
he &apos;s leaving , moving away .
where &apos;s he going ?
i &apos;ve stopped asking questions . the answers get scary .
yours leaves . mine returns .
logan ?
he &apos;s back .
i didn &apos;t let him past the front door .
hope you slammed it in his face .
ah , medium slam .
3 @-@ strike rule , jenna .
you &apos;re not even allowed to watch the news .
exactly . no more logan &quot; scum &quot; fell .
so any idea of where you &apos;ll go ?
i don &apos;t know . london , maybe . see some friends .
you don &apos;t have any friends , damon .
you &apos;re right , stefan . i only have you , so ...
where are we goin &apos; ?
&quot; we &quot; are not going anywhere .
i &apos;m gonna live my life as far away from you as possible .
but we &apos;re a team .
we could travel the world together .
we could try out for &quot; the amazing race . &quot;
hmm . that &apos;s funny .
seriously , where are you goin &apos; ?
&apos;cause we &apos;re not staying in this town .
i &apos;m here to see damon .
uh , sure . ok .
sheriff .
what a surprise .
sorry to bother you , but we need to talk .
come in .
um , i hope you understand the secrecy .
stefan doesn &apos;t know about this yet .
i &apos;d like to keep it that way .
of course. kids are too young to be brought into this .
so , what do you need ?
there &apos;s been another attack--
a female victim , her throat torn out ,
completely drained of blood .
it fits the pattern .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t understand .
i thought we solved that problem when i ...
staked the blonde one .
i &apos;m thinking she must have turned someone
or multiple someones . i don &apos;t know .
the story for the town is another animal attack ,
but i &apos;m not sure how long we can keep lying to them .
the council &apos;s in an uproar .
we thought we were past this .
so , uh , what do we do ?
you &apos;re the only one who &apos;s ever taken on a vampire .
we were hoping you could tell us .
and then the ballet dancer and the krumper did the salsa .
well , i was awake for that part .
well , i don &apos;t know when you fell asleep .
um , did you see the celine dion
waltz about cancer ?
those always make me cry .
yeah . and then the loud judge kept screamin &apos; ,
and i couldn &apos;t take it , so i turned it off .
i sat through &quot; family guy , &quot; so you owed me .
did i miss something ?
they &apos;ve been hanging out .
kind of weird , don &apos;t you think ?
she needs someone nice like him ,
as opposed to a homicidal vampire like damon .
yeah . how are you doing with all that ?
i &apos;m freaked out .
damon attacked me . i could be dead right now .
but i &apos;m also grateful .
what ? to stefan .
he saved my life , and ...
have you seen him ?
not since he told me was leaving .
for all i know , he &apos;s already gone .
he wouldn &apos;t leave without saying good @-@ bye .
yes , he would .
he thinks he &apos;s protecting me .
clean break and all that .
so what are you gonna do ?
what am i supposed to do ?
i already begged him not to go .
if i ask again , i &apos;m being selfish .
it is what it is .
well , maybe it &apos;s for the best .
what ? why ?
i mean , what kind of future could you have had with him ,
even if he stayed ?
did you just ...
no , i swear .
thank you for stopping by .
let me know what you come up with .
absolutely .
what is wrong with you ? you killed somebody ?
get off of me .
a--don &apos;t touch me .
b--if i had , i wouldn &apos;t have been so obvious about it .
c--there &apos;s another vampire in town .
that &apos;s impossible .
obviously not .
then who could it be ?
ah , what do we care ?
we &apos;re leavin &apos; anyway , right ?
no , i can &apos;t leave now , and you know that .
how are we supposed to find this person ?
let the adults handle this , stefan .
see you later , ok ?
bye .
bye .
we need to talk .
so what &apos;s up with you and forbes ?
nothin &apos;s up .
i saw you two in the hall today .
don &apos;t even try and deny it , bro .
you &apos;re tappin &apos; that .
no , it &apos;s not like that .
never is till you become &quot; we people . &quot;
&quot; we people &quot; ?
&quot; we &apos;ll never miss a game . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t like the color red . &quot;
we hung out , like , twice .
like i said , &quot; we . &quot;
so you have no idea who it could be ?
none .
but it must be somebody new ,
because leaving a body like that ,
they &apos;re either sloppy ,
or they &apos;re trying to send a message .
and you &apos;re sure it &apos;s not damon .
well , i &apos;m never sure about damon ,
but he &apos;s been trying to keep a low profile lately ,
so it just doesn &apos;t make any sense to me .
so what are you gonna do ?
damon &apos;s tracking them right now .
look , i promised you the truth ,
so i wanted to tell you .
i want you to be careful .
when i saw you , i ...
thought you were coming to say goodbye .
not yet .
hey , what do you think ?
creepy .
found this old journal in dad &apos;s stuff--
jonathan gilbert from the 1800s .
he &apos;s kind of a freak show . he wrote about demons
and all these people getting slaughtered and--
yeah , he was a writer-- short stories , horror stuff .
oh , he wrote fiction ?
figured he was just a lunatic or a drunk .
well , he was a gilbert ,
probably a little bit of both .
so what do i do now ?
just wait . i &apos;ll be there in a minute .
can you hurry ? i have things to do .
you could give me that .
so why did you need me to do this ?
because i interfere with the signal .
can i go now ?
this has blown , like , half of my day .
you do that .
get in your car . go home .
forget i asked you to do this .
ok . bye now .
bye .
i have tons of these wooden bullets
so nothin &apos; funky .
you don &apos;t wanna do this . trust me .
that &apos;s what you get .
for what ?
you made me like this .
i killed you . i didn &apos;t turn you .
see , i know what you and your brother are .
i &apos;ve been watchin &apos; the two of you .
i knew you &apos;d show up here
and i &apos;m glad you did
cause i have some questions .
me first . who turned you ?
how should i know ?
last thing i remember is i &apos;m about to stake your brother ,
and then you grabbed me . that &apos;s it .
until i wake up in the ground
behind a used @-@ car dealership on highway 4 .
somebody buried me .
it happens . ow .
you bit me .
damn it .
it had to be you .
you have to have vampire blood in your system when you die .
i didn &apos;t do that .
some other vampire found you ,
gave you their blood .
who ?
that &apos;s what i wanna know .
dude , it &apos;s not like the welcome wagon
was waiting with a bundt cake and a handbook .
it &apos;s been a learn @-@ as @-@ you @-@ go process .
you know , one minute ,
i &apos;m a small @-@ town on @-@ the @-@ rise news guy ,
and next thing i know , i can &apos;t get into my house ,
because my foot won &apos; go through the door .
you have to be invited in .
i know . i live alone .
ah. heh heh . that sucks .
so now i &apos;m at the ramada watchin &apos; pay @-@ per @-@ view all day ,
eating everything in sight ,
including housekeeping .
it could be worse .
all i can think about is blood and killing people .
i can &apos;t stop killing people .
i keep killing . heh heh .
and i like it .
i &apos;m conflicted .
welcome to the club .
wait a minute .
cops only found one body .
i left one . i was tired .
but i &apos;ve been hidin &apos; the rest of the other bodies .
they &apos;re right back there .
you &apos;re kidding .
they &apos;re just pilin &apos; up .
so what do we know ?
nothing new to report yet .
my highly reliable deputies are all on alert ,
but if you feel the need to be more proactive ,
by all means , grab a stake and have at it .
what extra precautions can we take ?
for right now
there &apos;s nowhere safer than a crowded public place ,
and for once , mayor , we actually know where our kids are .
what do you want ?
hey. uh , just surprised to see you here .
art usually implies culture ,
and culture implies , well , not you .
go to hell .
still wanna be an astronaut ?
i can &apos;t believe you remember that .
i can remember the tinfoil that you wore on your head .
i was 8 .
how are you doing ?
i &apos;ve had it easier .
you ?
uh , i heard some things .
so it &apos;s true that you and stefan ...
yeah , it is .
what about you ...
matt donovan ?
i heard about caroline .
aw , man , not you , too .
we &apos;re friends .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
no ?
no .
why am i so overly emotional ?
all i can think about is my ex @-@ girlfriend .
i wanna be with her and bite her and stuff .
well , you probably love her .
anything you felt before will be magnified now .
you &apos;re gonna have to learn how to control that .
what about walkin &apos; in the sun ?
i &apos;m a morning person .
you can walk in the sun , which , by the way ,
is pretty cool .
council &apos;d never suspect you .
it &apos;s not in the journals .
the journals ?
yeah , the founding fathers ,
they passed down journals to their kids .
come on , man . you gotta tell me .
how can you walk around in the sun ?
who turned you ?
how do you walk in the sun ?
who turned you ?
you know , i &apos;ve been really nice so far ,
but i will kill you .
then you &apos;ll never know .
you &apos;re not answering my question .
you first .
seems we &apos;re at a bit of an impasse then , doesn &apos;t it ?
i have things to do , people to kill .
guess i &apos;ll be needing a little head start .
ahh . damn it .
i &apos;m guessing you &apos;re not here to
plan the path for your future .
you &apos;re looking out for me .
hope that &apos;s ok .
you know , i wanted to be a doctor
before everything happened , but , uh ,
then i couldn &apos;t , cause ...
the blood .
yeah .
i &apos;ve dabbled in a bunch of different things , though .
didn &apos;t love anything enough to stick to it ?
no , i--i loved it all .
i just--i had to move on before
anybody could notice that i wasn &apos;t getting any older .
how long before that would happen ?
few years , usually .
sometimes shorter .
and you always left .
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
so what about-- what about you ?
what are your , uh , plans for the future ?
i don &apos;t wanna talk about my future , stefan ,
because everything you &apos;re saying is making it perfectly clear
that you &apos;re not gonna be in it .
elena , it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t wanna in it .
you can &apos;t , i get it .
i heard you the first me and the second time ,
and i appreciate you looking out for me ,
but , please , if you &apos;re gonna leave , then just go .
hide me .
what &apos;s going on ?
the scum fell has landed .
logan &apos;s here .
wait . logan fell ?
stefan , what &apos;s going on ?
jenna , are you dodging me ?
it &apos;s a form of self @-@ preservation .
um , elena , why don &apos;t you and jenna go somewhere else .
let &apos;s go .
what are you doin &apos; here ?
you know , your brother asked me the same thing .
in fact , why don &apos;t we
just skip past all that &quot; who turned me &quot; stuff
and get the answer that i want ?
how can i turn into a daywalker ?
damon and i are the only 2 that i know of .
but you &apos;re both very cagey on the how ,
which tells me that there is a way .
you know , in case you hadn &apos;t noticed
i &apos;m quite the celebrity in this town .
it would be very , very easy for me to expose you .
you wanna know how you can walk around in the sun ?
i do .
you can &apos;t .
don &apos;t ever threaten me again .
when logan came to the house , what did he say ?
fake flattery . stupid , dimpled grin . puppy dog eyes .
i &apos;m serious , jenna .
how did he act ? what did he say ?
he was the usual logan , was charming ,
little more manic than usual .
he kept trying to convince me to let him in .
what ?
ok , listen to me very carefully .
do not , under any circumstances ,
talk to him again . i &apos;m serious , jenna , like , ever .
hey . elena .
jenna .
hi , mr. saltzman .
yeah , i was hopin &apos; to , uh , see you tonight .
career night is the new bowling .
ok. um , excuse me .
logan fell &apos;s a vampire ,
and when i find him again ,
i am gonna destroy him limb by limb .
what happened ? you ok ?
no . i &apos;m not ok . i was ambushed .
i was shot . now i &apos;m vengeful .
just gotta find him .
well , there &apos;s no need . he &apos;s here at the school .
you &apos;re kidding me .
why the hell is he there ?
he &apos;s workin &apos; the crowd .
well , i &apos;ll be right there .
so anything you &apos;d like to share ?
what are you doin &apos; ?
following my future .
there it is
broadcast journalism ?
yes . broadcast journalism .
why are you looking at me like that ?
you don &apos;t even read the paper .
liz .
logan .
what are you gonna do , stake me ?
bury me in another shallow grave ?
what would the e @-@ mail say this time ?
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
you bitch .
i died for you , for this town .
you &apos;ve known me since i was 6,
and you swept me under the rug like dirt .
you knew what you were getting into .
i was one of you .
and now you &apos;re one of them .
watch your back , sheriff .
get a backup team to the school immediately .
keep it within the circle . it &apos;s a v5 .
i didn &apos;t know you drew .
it &apos;s an elective .
&apos;cause it &apos;s good stuff . you like graphics ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s , uh-- that &apos;s kind of my thing .
whoa. whoa . what are you doin &apos; ?
well , it &apos;s just something else we have in common .
and what &apos;s the other thing ? vicki ?
let &apos;s hang out because we did the same chick ?
go be friends with one of the many other guys that she screwed .
there &apos;s no shortage of &apos; em .
all right , work it out , tough guy .
you two , follow me .
excuse me , mayor .
where are you takin &apos; &apos; em ?
i &apos;m gonna talk to &apos; em .
all fights should end in handshakes , don &apos;t you think ?
bonnie , where are you ? i &apos;m ready to go .
i &apos;ll be outside .
hey , damsel in distress .
need a ride ?
oh , my god . logan fell , channel 9 , is that you ?
i used to baby @-@ sit you , caroline forbes . don &apos;t mock me .
well , i was supposed to go home with bonnie ,
but i can &apos;t find her .
it &apos;s not a problem , really .
it &apos;s on my way .
ok .
you know , this is fate .
and why is that ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m interested in broadcast journalism .
so can i ask you a couple questions ?
anything you want .
first , buckle up .
ok
have you seen logan fell , the news guy ?
yeah . he just gave caroline a ride home .
stay here .
ok .
let &apos;s get this out of your system .
go ahead . fight .
you want us to what ?
i &apos;m not gonna fight him , dad .
i don &apos;t think so , sir .
you don &apos;t fight in there like pansies .
you take it outside , fight your battl like men , and move on .
best lesson my dad taught me .
so let &apos;s settle it .
fight .
come on , dad .
it &apos;s not gonna happen .
i said fight !
whoa . what &apos;s goin &apos; on out here ?
just lettin &apos; these 2 kids work it out .
we &apos;re good here , go back inside .
i don &apos;t wanna go back inside .
what i want is an answer to my question .
what &apos;s goin &apos; on out here ?
who do you think you &apos;re talking to ?
do i look like a student ?
no , you look like a full @-@ grown alpha @-@ male douche bag .
you don &apos;t talk to me like that .
i can have your job like this .
how you do that .
then it &apos;ll be you and me
in this parking lot working things out .
you cool with that ?
you just marked yourself .
ok .
you all right ?
where are you ?
your daughter has expressed an interesting journalism .
i think it &apos;s important to foster young minds .
what do you want ?
the satisfaction of turning your daughter into a vampire .
payback &apos;s a bitch , isn &apos;t it ?
get her out of here .
logan , what happened ? ! logan !
sheriff . hey @-@ it &apos;s damon .
where &apos;s caroline ?
she &apos;s ok . i @-@ i &apos;m on elm street .
gonna try this one more time .
who turned you ?
i told you i don &apos;t know .
this tire iron here could take your head clean off .
is that your final answer ?
how can you side with them ?
i don &apos;t side with anyone .
you pissed me off , i want you dead .
who turned you ?
i don &apos;t know !
oh , well . you &apos;re screwed .
wait , wait ! i know .
you &apos;re lying .
you think you &apos;re the only one that wants to get
in that tomb underneath the old church ?
if you are lying to me , i will end you .
i am not lying . there &apos;s another way to break the spell .
we can help you .
meet me at the old church .
take me down . make it look real .
make it look real .
where is she ?
she &apos;s ok .
oh , god .
my brother &apos;s taken her ho .
i &apos;m sorry , sheriff .
i just wasn &apos;t strong enough .
caroline ?
she &apos;s ok . i took her home .
she was shaken up , but all she knows
is logan attacked her . nothing else .
where &apos;s logan ?
damon &apos;s dealing with it .
as in ...
you saw what happened today , right ?
i mean , you understand why we can &apos;t ...
be together ? you see it ?
yeah , i &apos;m starting to see a lot of things , stefan .
come on . i &apos;ll , uh--
i &apos;ll give you a ride .
uh , i can get home .
i know .
all right . that &apos;d be nice .
what do you want ?
i don &apos;t know .
i , uh--i thought that was weird with your dad ,
what did he
is he like that all the time ? is that--
is that what you gotta go through ?
man , i--i get it .
i get it .
what &apos;s your problem ?
look , i don &apos;t need your pity .
seriously , you don &apos;t have to be like this .
you don &apos;t .
just go .
what &apos;s your problem , man ?
i don &apos;t know , ok .
i don &apos;t know .
what i said before about you leaving , it was harsh .
no , no . you--you had every right .
you asked me what i wanted my future to be .
i wanted to be a writer .
my mom sort of pushed me into that direction
from the time i was able to read .
she supported me , encouraged me ,
bought me my first journal ,
and then she died .
and i can &apos;t see myself being a writer anymore .
that was something that we shared .
i know that you think that you brought
all of this bad stuff into my life ,
but my life already had it .
i was buried in it .
this is different .
it doesn &apos;t make it any less painful .
i know that it &apos;s-- that it &apos;s hard to understand ...
but i &apos;m doing this for you .
no .
you don &apos;t get to make that decision for me .
if you walk away , it &apos;s for you , because i know what i want .
stefan , i love you .
don &apos;t .
elena , i can &apos;t .
yes , you can .
don &apos;t hide from me .
who are you ? a friend of jenna &apos;s .
jenna sent you ?
i came on my own .
ah . i get it .
well , buddy , i know you think this makes you brave ,
but actually it makes you pretty stupid .
either way , here i am .
what do you want ?
ah , jenna &apos;s a good person . she deserves the best .
i &apos;m here to make sure she gets it .
was that supposed to be a threat ?
couldn &apos;t you throw a punch ?
maybe provoke me a little ?
i &apos;m not a violent guy by design .
well , you &apos;re not a very smart one , either .
how &apos;s that ?
cause you have no idea who you &apos;re talking to .
i need a ride .
sure .
look , i like caroline .
she &apos;s got this thing , this way about her ,
and i like her , ok ?
and i &apos;m not gonna defend it or apologize about it .
ok .
so stop your little bromance bitch act .
ok .
yeah .
i &apos;ll be right there .
i &apos;ve never been in your room before .
well , hasn &apos;t changed much over the years .
do you leave everything here when you come and go ?
it &apos;s the only place that has remained constant .
this room holds every memory
that i ever thought was important enough to hold on to .
a lot of memories .
yeah .
you thirsty or anything ?
a little . you ?
i &apos;m fine .
let me get you something to drink , ok ?
ok .
hello .
i just wanted to say thank you .
i don &apos;t know how you did it .
uh , not following .
we found logan &apos;s body out by the old fell warehouse .
it &apos;s been disposed of .
he was hoarding bodies , innocent victims .
what ?
this town owes you so much .
so do i.
