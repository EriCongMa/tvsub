watch out !
we have one choice here .
make it look like rollins skipped town .
what happened with hanna , it was confusing .
but that &apos;s all it was . a moment of confusion .
i just need more time .
i judged you too quickly .
why don &apos;t we start over ? let &apos;s get dinner this week .
i &apos;m marco .
i &apos;m leaving .
you &apos;ve written a really beautiful love story for nicole .
i can finally hear her name now
without trying to ... put my fist through a wall .
if we just stay calm and stick to the plan , we &apos;ll be fine .
this is about containment , and right now
everyone who knows about rollins is sitting in this car .
and by the time the police realize that he &apos;s missing
he &apos;ll be halfway towards philly .
i thought i could go back in there , but i can &apos;t .
everyone is counting on us .
you promise you &apos;ll come back for me .
we find the burner phone , we find elliot &apos;s accomplice .
it &apos;s mary drake . who else could it possibly be ?
hi , archer . it &apos;s jenna .
emily , hey , i thought you might want to stop by ali &apos;s
on your way to hollis .
they &apos;re releasing her this morning .
and i look kinda conspicuous standing here alone .
i still feel horrible
that i ever believed that she did it .
okay , she just got here , so call her , text her or just come by .
hi , we tried to get you out .
it &apos;s okay .
i figured it out .
is that jason ?
nope , jason couldn &apos;t make it .
okay , so who ..
a casserole ?
aria , what a thoughtful gesture . thank you .
just , uh , little something in case
alison doesn &apos;t wanna cook dinner .
well , we have to ask you around , you know
sometime soon to repay the kindness .
but for now ..
... alison needs her rest .
i could use the company .
well , that &apos;s what you have me for .
you &apos;re staying here ?
doctor &apos;s orders .
terms of my release .
aunt mary
do you mind if we have a moment ?
of course .
what the hell is she doing here ?
after what happened with elliot
welby &apos;s concerned that i &apos;ll sue
so they &apos;re doing an internal investigation and ..
... she &apos;s gonna be staying with me
until a social worker can review my case .
she was helping him
in zombie make @-@ up .
i had to get out of there somehow .
and it &apos;s easier to keep an eye on her here .
what &apos;s going on with jenna ?
do we know why she was calling elliot ?
mona &apos;s got his burner phone .
she &apos;s been digging around , but we haven &apos;t heard--
ladies , i &apos;m sorry
but i really must insist .
ali ... do you want me to stay ?
she &apos;s just gonna keep acting like a demented den @-@ mother
if you &apos;re here .
leave me alone with her . i &apos;ll get some answers
and i &apos;ll check in later .
i don &apos;t like this .
trust me ... neither do i.
第七季第五集
elliot contacted me in london .
he told me about charlotte .
that she survived
only to be murdered .
and that nearly shattered me , having my baby given back to me
in the same moment she was taken away .
elliot seemed to share in my grief .
could i get a glass of water ?
elliot and i had charlotte in common too .
he sucked me in in the same way .
what i don &apos;t understand
is how you could agree to help a stranger
drive another person insane .
rollins was clever
manipulative
and i was ... so vulnerable .
as we consoled one another , he began to share his suspicions .
that i killed charlotte .
i did nothing but try and help her .
i didn &apos;t know you , alison
and my experiences with your mother made it easy for me
to believe you were cut from the same cloth .
and that &apos;s why you thought i deserved to die ?
i never agreed to that .
he told me that charlotte wanted me to have her money
and that for me was justice but ..
he wanted vengeance .
i tried to talk him out of it
but he was intent on taking an eye for an eye .
and now i regret ever believing a thing he told me .
alison , i hope that my telling the truth
will earn your forgiveness .
i have so little family left . i never should have ..
do we know anything else about who he really is ?
the police know that elliot rollins is a fake identity
that he wasn &apos;t even a real doctor .
they &apos;re still investigating .
well , it &apos;s been quite an emotional morning .
i could use a lie down .
which way is the guestroom , please ?
it &apos;s upstairs , at the end of the hall .
it &apos;s an old mattress .
i hope you don &apos;t find it too uncomfortable .
i &apos;ve slept on worse .
if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll go upstairs now .
morning .
you &apos;re one of those morning people , aren &apos;t you ?
coffee is a nice touch .
it &apos;s my way of saying sorry
that i talked your ear off
and kept you up all night .
no , i liked getting to know you more .
i talked until you fell asleep .
heh , guess i missed my chance for a goodnight kiss .
here .
for future reference
i usually talk like that when i &apos;m nervous
and when i &apos;m waiting for somebody to make the first move .
anything important ?
no .
just my friends wanting to meet up in the morning before i can ..
oh , my god !
what ?
oh , no .
what ?
my test started ten minutes ago .
okay , what do you need ?
just take your time finish your coffee
spare key &apos;s in that bowl
and just lock up before you leave , okay ?
bye .
oh ! what a surprise . i wasn &apos;t expecting you .
yeah , i just needed a quiet place to work .
how was your trip ?
good ..
productive .
are you in the middle of a thought
or can i come give you a proper hello ?
hello .
i missed you .
i missed you too
something happened while i was away .
what do you mean ?
i needed to get out of town to concentrate on liam &apos;s notes
but i spent a night in new york .
i went to see nicole &apos;s parents .
i wanted them to know about us and
they needed to know that i &apos;m moving forward with my life .
yeah . what did they say ?
they were happy for me .
i never understood why they were so worried about me .
they were the ones who lost their daughter .
they didn &apos;t want you to be alone .
yeah .
i just didn &apos;t know if it would make you uncomfortable .
no , i &apos;m glad you went .
i &apos;m sure that meant a lot to them .
and it felt wrong keeping a secret from you .
so can you take a break
tell me what i missed while i was away ?
nothing much , really .
正在进行考试
no , i know , i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m so late but ..
okay .
oh , no .
attention all available units .
backup requested at malvern station
15 north warren avenue .
11 @-@ 24 with possible 10 @-@ 57 .
10 @-@ 57 肇事逃逸
does that mean they found rollins &apos; car ?
yeah , an 11 @-@ 24 is an abandoned vehicle
and that other code is for missing persons .
yeah , except he &apos;s not missing .
well , that &apos;s the way they &apos;re playing it .
did you see that article buried in the back of the paper ?
the cops are withholding details .
does that mean we &apos;re screwed ?
no , actually . it means that they think
that he &apos;s alive and on the run .
which means that they &apos;re putting together the pieces
exactly how we want them to .
just keep your head down .
everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
what are you working on ?
um , business plan lucas wants by tomorrow .
it &apos;s aria .
she said mona found something
on elliot &apos;s burner phone .
there &apos;s a location besides the car
where rollins used this phone a lot .
well , did she say where it was ?
no , i guess it &apos;s hard to trace .
mona said that it might take a while .
okay , what else ?
well , she recovered his deleted text
and ... found this .
wait a minute , so rollins knew that
ali didn &apos;t kill charlotte .
he sent that the night he took alison out of welby .
okay , if this text means what i think it means ..
he wasn &apos;t taking alison somewhere to kill her .
i thought we were the ones who helped
convince him ali did it .
do we know who he sent this to ?
no , there &apos;s no names in the contact list
and mona thinks that that number probably belongs
to another burner phone .
i mean , how much do wanna bet that
that number belongs to jenna ?
why would jenna actually care who killed charlotte ?
i don &apos;t know .
how did he know that ali didn &apos;t do it ?
i ... don &apos;t know .
and he can &apos;t tell us now , can he ?
i would &apos;ve been there this morning , but i overslept .
late night .
shift at the bar ?
no , i had a date .
didn &apos;t know you were seeing anyone .
yeah , it &apos;s new .
okay , 23 wexford street , apartment 109 ?
we &apos;re supposed to recognize that ?
i thought maybe ali would .
mona said that &apos;s where rollins used his burner .
maybe , but that &apos;s not where he lived .
he rented a guest cottage in town .
old stone carriage house somebody converted .
i thought it was so romantic .
so ... rollins had a burner phone
and a burner apartment ?
nothing he told me was true .
not where he lived , what his name was , where he was from .
ali , rollins wasn &apos;t trying to kill you that night .
at least , we don &apos;t think so anymore .
that doesn &apos;t make him any less of an ass .
we don &apos;t know who he was texting , do we ?
i vote jenna .
she is definitely a liar .
my guess is mary drake .
according to her story , she bailed when things got ..
... murdery .
and you believe mary ?
believe her , maybe .
trust her ... not yet .
maybe we should go to this ... burner apartment .
you know , maybe then we could find out who he was texting .
yeah , and who this person is
that thought i killed charlotte .
great idea but we can &apos;t .
hanna said it sounds like the police found the car
so maybe they &apos;ve already figured out who rollins really is .
well , so then we need to get there before they do .
no , aria &apos;s right .
if the cops find out , they could tie us
to his disappearance .
so we do nothing .
it &apos;s too risky , em .
god , all those lies i told
you think i would &apos;ve seen elliot coming from a mile away .
ezra .
hello ?
nicole , is that you ?
hello ?
there is no explanation that i can think of for a ghost
with an international calling plan .
what is that sound ?
practicing my pisco sour .
i can &apos;t get my egg whites to froth .
why don &apos;t you just come over .
we &apos;ll day drink until you calm down .
that &apos;s actually not a bad idea .
no , just tell me what to do .
aria , nicole is dead , okay .
they had a funeral for her . the case is officially closed .
and you obviously can &apos;t tell ezra .
what good would it do ?
you know , the same thing happened
about three months after my dad died .
did you freak out ?
no . but my mom did .
she sent out boxes of clothing and things to my cousin .
he was in a flood and lost almost everything .
my dad &apos;s phone ended up in one of the boxes
and ... without thinking about it
my cousin used my dad &apos;s phone to call my mom .
and it looked like your dad was calling her .
i &apos;ll delete the call .
i think it &apos;s for the best .
bye .
晚点再谢我 忘恩负义的贱人 -ad
hey , spence .
i &apos;m sorry . i really hate to bug you with this
but i &apos;ve been trying to find caleb .
he hasn &apos;t been returning messages or calls
for the past couple of days .
are you at the state park ?
yeah .
did you drive to the parking lot at the laura campground ?
that &apos;s the one that caleb likes .
yeah , i tried there , and i tried the trail hut
that ends at the falls and the bait and tackle shop too .
well , you can try the ranger station .
i mean , he &apos;d have to have a day pass if he &apos;s camping there .
hanna ?
do you see this ?
she &apos;s still here .
yeah , follow her .
we have no idea why she &apos;s back in town
or why she called rollins &apos; phone .
if she really was working with rollins
we can &apos;t risk jenna figuring out that we &apos;re on to her .
she can &apos;t see you following her .
it &apos;s not like she has working eyes in the back of her head .
i &apos;m talking about the cops .
me acting normal doesn &apos;t include
tiptoeing around behind a girl with a big white cane .
i think i have another way to check up on jenna .
ranger station , go .
i &apos;ll call you if i find anything .
okay , thank you .
thank me later , ungrateful bitch .
alright , can we day drink , just a little ?
right now , we &apos;re thinking , not drinking .
well , there &apos;s something bugging me about this text .
you know , why would a.d. do me any favors ?
i don &apos;t know , and i don &apos;t even wanna think about
what you &apos;re gonna have to do to repay the debt .
i &apos;m not gonna wait around for a.d. to twist my arm with this .
em ..
okay , i @-@ i really don &apos;t think you should do that .
is it jenna ?
no , it &apos;s just a number .
&quot; the usual spot . &quot; where the hell is that ?
there &apos;s only one place i can think of .
the burner apartment .
what if the cops show up ?
well , hopefully , we &apos;ll find out who is helping rollins first .
whether it &apos;s mary drake or jenna marshall .
if we have something to hand over to the cops
there &apos;s no more a.d.
how are we supposed to get in ?
seatbelts first , question &apos;s later--
hey , i was just thinking about you .
hey , sabrina .
aria , right ?
yeah . hey .
um , nice to see you , again .
um , well , you guys are going somewhere , i don &apos;t wanna keep--
no , it &apos;s fine . we &apos;re ..
okay . uh , i was just wondering how your test went ?
it was good . great .
okay .
uh , well , i have some deliveries to make .
our guy didn &apos;t show so ..
okay .
sorry , that was really awkward .
oh , come on . we need to get there first .
did elliot leave this mess for you ?
i can help you tidy up .
where is it ?
you tell me what it is you &apos;re after
i can help you find it .
you know what i &apos;m after .
you helped him take it , and now it &apos;s all gone .
he double @-@ crossed me .
what are you talking about ?
that lying bastard was just greedy .
are you sure that he took everything ?
checkings , savings , joint accounts
my safety deposit boxes
and my shares at the carissimi group .
it &apos;s all gone !
okay , okay .
he must have used his power of attorney
to empty the accounts and escaped
but ... the police will find him .
you &apos;ll get your money back .
what if they don &apos;t find him ?
alison , i &apos;m so terribly sorry .
just tell me what it is
that you want me to do , and i &apos;ll do it .
i wanna make this right .
i can &apos;t sleep in here .
i &apos;d like to file a missing persons report .
official or off the record ?
help me , toby wan kenobi . you &apos;re my only hope .
i &apos;m sorry . it was a terrible joke .
i don &apos;t even know why ..
that means he &apos;s staying with you .
no , but you know where he is .
caleb just needs some time to think .
okay . he &apos;ll reach out to you when he &apos;s ready .
this is messy . i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t ..
sorry you got pulled into it .
he &apos;s my friend ... so are you .
if you want , i can tell him that you stopped by and--
no ! no , no , no . thank you though .
um , i should , i should go . i was just ..
excuse me .
sorry .
hi there .
have you guys met ?
no . i don &apos;t think we have .
okay . um , spencer hastings , this is detective marco furey .
he is my new supervisor on the rollins case .
it &apos;s nice to meet you .
yes , you as well .
uh , well , i &apos;m sure you guys have a lot of work to do
so i will let you get to it .
right over here in the ..
this doesn &apos;t fit ..
jenna . what a treat ?
alison ? i thought you were in the hospital .
so you came to my house .
to find out how you were doing .
i figured you wouldn &apos;t wanna see me
but i didn &apos;t think there was any harm in ..
... asking your husband .
elliot doesn &apos;t live here anymore .
did something happen ?
you tell me .
you seem to know a lot about what &apos;s happening
in my private life .
how do you and elliot know each other ?
um ... this was a mistake .
your mistake was trying to convince him
that i killed charlotte .
you haven &apos;t been well , alison .
i think you &apos;re confused .
am i ?
the next time you call archer
tell him i said to go to hell !
maybe he &apos;s already there .
do you think $ 20 was enough to keep the manager quiet ?
i slipped him a number two .
well , number two , imperial garden .
i hope he likes moo @-@ shu ..
what a dump .
it &apos;s like rollins was two different people .
yeah , or someone else was living here .
well , whoever it is is a slob .
the sink is disgusting .
hey , help me pull down the murphy bed .
it &apos;s stuck .
oh , my god !
it &apos;s a head . it &apos;s a head . it &apos;s a head .
whose head ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t wanna know . i can &apos;t look at that .
em . no , don &apos;t touch it .
oh , it &apos;s not real .
the fall broke the face off .
who keeps a fake head stuffed under their pillow ?
someone pretending to be darren wilden .
&apos;what can i get you ? &apos;
john collins , rocks , extra sour .
&apos;sure thing.&apos;
&apos;is this seat taken ? &apos;
the bar looks pretty empty to ... me .
i &apos;m sorry .
here , let me help you .
thank you .
you &apos;re sara harvey , aren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m jenna marshall .
i think a few of the girls you know
are a few of the girls i know .
what an unfortunate thing for us to have in common ?
well , the unfortunate things make us who we are .
can i buy you a drink ?
only if you &apos;ll have one with me .
are you a sour girl ?
well , i can be .
bartender , she &apos;ll have the same .
four cherries , please .
&apos;coming right up.&apos;
are you putting your hands in there ?
you &apos;re the one sitting on the bed .
there &apos;s something at the bottom .
what is that ?
elliot wasn &apos;t a slob . this mess was a cover .
you &apos;re not gonna believe what happened
while you were gone .
aria and emily found out that rollins has a secret apartment .
they didn &apos;t go there , did they ?
they set a trap for jenna .
well , get this , i used my mom &apos;s password
to get in the radley reservation system .
jenna just extended her stay .
here ?
she was supposed to check out this morning
but i guess something changed her mind .
things happen , hanna .
i mean , people change their plans .
remember when we were only supposed to come back
for a couple of days , and we ended up
in this fricking nightmare that &apos;s kept us trapped here .
i &apos;m sorry .
so no luck at the ranger station ?
can we please not talk about caleb .
spence , i don &apos;t wanna be the one who messed this up .. ... for either of you .
so ... what can i do ? how can i fix this ?
maybe you can start by figuring out
why you &apos;re wearing one guy &apos;s ring
when you might have feelings for another .
passports with no photos , a couple of plane tickets .
it &apos;s like rollins had an exit strategy in place
for him and someone else .
what &apos;s in that book ?
it &apos;s a ledger . couple of things .
for a big doctor , his handwriting is super legible .
&apos;and he kept very detailed records.&apos;
cash payments to m.d. and j.m.
mary drake and jenna marshall .
he was paying them cash , but for what ?
i don &apos;t know . there @-@ there &apos;s no reference here to a.d.
where did you find that ?
over there on the seat cushion .
pretty sure mice lived in there .
also , i found his personal library .
&quot; archer dunhill . &quot;
a.d.
&apos;open up ! rosewood pd . open up.&apos;
i know you &apos;re in there .
toby .
you wanna tell me why you &apos;re here ?
alison found a slip of paper
with this address on it at her house .
so we told her that we would check it out .
do you have this slip of paper ?
we left it with her .
you guys haven &apos;t been anywhere near malvern station lately , have you ?
no . why ?
we found rollins &apos; car .
a receipt for six months advance rent on this place
was in the glove box .
this guy &apos;s on the run . he &apos;s dangerous .
what if he &apos;d been hiding out here ?
listen , my new boss is waiting to hear from me .
when he does , he &apos;s gonna come by here
with a couple of detectives .
he &apos;s gonna comb through this place .
you can &apos;t be here .
did you touch anything ?
you got five minutes before i call it in .
i didn &apos;t hear you leave ?
oh , i took a walk around the neighborhood after i ate .
there &apos;s a ... particular shade of blue in the evening sky .
it settles me .
have you eaten ? i could heat up some of your friend &apos;s casserole .
the song you were humming .
my mom used to sing that to me as a lullaby .
&quot; little sparrow . &quot;
your mom and i used to fall asleep to that song .
your grandmother used to sing it to us .
it came to mind while i was out walking .
i don &apos;t know what brought that up .
though i suppose when i think about the lyrics--
there &apos;s not a lot of birds out at night .
this song is about love , alison .
about men ... and lies .
all you maidens hede my warning
never trust the hearts of men .
they will crush you like a sparrow .
leaving you to never mend .
i obviously wasn &apos;t paying attention .
kind of explains a lot .
i &apos;ve made those same mistakes myself one time or another .
alright . i may read a little before bed .
goodnight .
goodnight .
good evening . this is detective marco furey
from the rosewood police department .
detective furey ?
you &apos;ve been assigned to lead the investigation ?
i thought it was time we met .
thank you for coming in , mrs. rollins .
uh , dilaurentis , please .
right . i &apos;m sorry . please have a seat .
we got a call from your bank &apos;s branch manager .
i , um , i told them to let me handle that .
well , the amount of money in question
requires mandatory reporting .
i can only help if you let me .
i wasn &apos;t trying to make things difficult .
i just ..
i was surprised .
i understand . he put you through hell .
and i &apos;m sure the news at the bank today
was a little overwhelming .
but it did help us work up a theory .
and we think that your husband targeted you for your money .
it seems that he was passing himself off as a dr. rollins
ever since charlotte dilaurentis was admitted to welby .
all of it , just so that he could ...
after you were incapacitated
in the psychiatric facility , he took off .
an after @-@ hours ticket kiosk at the malvern station
recorded rollins &apos; purchase of a train ticket .
and now we know what happened when he got off that train .
oh , um , where do you , you think he is ?
elliot rollins was last seen in baltimore .
seen ?
oh , a credit card under his assumed name was used to rent a car .
driver was then later captured on a traffic cam
heading west on interstate 70 .
but i &apos;m still waiting for a positive id from the rental agent .
i mean , he could be anywhere by now .
well , we shared his plate information and description
with the local authorities and highway patrol
as far west as denver .
miss dilaurentis
this guy , he &apos;s turned your entire life upside down .
i won &apos;t stop until we find him .
and two red eyes and one of those lattes with soy . thanks .
hey , can i interrupt ?
hey , uh , yeah .
i know i said i would call
but i thought i better do this in person .
yeah .
listen ,
when i saw you earlier today--
i was a complete weirdo . i get it .
you don &apos;t have to have the talk .
no , sabrina , i was in a rush--
really , there is ... zero obligation .
it was just a date .
it was a first date . i mean , it was good--
okay , look , look , look . i &apos;m not here to have &quot; the talk . &quot;
i wanted to ask you out again .
oh . okay .
um , yeah , that is ..
this is much better than a call .
i &apos;m free on saturday .
great .
thanks .
that &apos;s a lot of coffee . late night study session ?
i heard you were finishing up college at hollis .
how did you hear that ?
toby mentioned it .
must feel good to come home and finish what you started .
i should get back to the hotel .
goodnight .
rollins stole from you ?
i &apos;m completely broke . he took everything .
this just keep getting worse .
guys , we deliberately pointed the cops towards philly .
that &apos;s where this trail was supposed to end .
so this means ..
somebody knows . somebody knows what i did .
henna , you &apos;re not alone in this .
i &apos;m gonna be sick .
god , when she panics like that , i can &apos;t even think .
sorry .
i &apos;ll just .. i &apos;ll put it on vibrate .
is mary drake behind this ?
is she trying to let the cops know
that the whole trail we set up was fake ? &apos;
i honestly don &apos;t think so .
i mean , she &apos;s been at the hospital
the past few days helping me get out .
i don &apos;t think she had time to go to baltimore .
what about sara and jenna ?
i mean , who even knew that sara harvey was still in town .
maybe sara is keeping an eye on us for jenna .
that could be why she &apos;s been here all this time .
it &apos;s too strange to be a coincidence .
the two people with the biggest ax
to grind against us are @-@ are teaming up
to chop our alibi to bits .
we &apos;d know for sure it was them if someone had showed up
at the apartment today .
yeah . well , toby &apos;s squad car probably scared them away .
okay . i didn &apos;t tell you guys earlier
but i really screwed up today .
jenna showed up at the house asking for elliot
and now i think she knows that we &apos;re on to her .
thanks to me , she knows about the burner phone
and i &apos;m pretty sure she can figure out
that he wouldn &apos;t just give it to us without a fight .
you guys , um , it &apos;s ezra .
something happened today .
i have to go .
right now , aria ?
i &apos;m sorry . yeah . i have to go .
it &apos;s fine .
但我在上面找不到一点证据 -ad
ezra !
ezra !
you look--
confused .
oh , i was gonna say beautiful .
what &apos;s going on ?
well , i &apos;m gonna talk
um , for a little bit at least
and then you &apos;re going to listen .
then it &apos;ll be your turn to talk .
you told me once a long time ago
that you couldn &apos;t ... imagine your life without me
and i told you that i wanted you in mine
and that we would , we would figure something out .
and then we spent years apart , a world apart .
five years later when you walked in the door
after all that time
it felt like , it felt like the last flat stretch of track
of a roller @-@ coaster ride ..
... right before it comes to a stop
where your stomach &apos;s flipping out and your knees are weak
but you can ... breathe again .
that &apos;s when i knew ..
... i want you in my life , aria , for the rest of my life .
i don &apos;t ever wanna let you go .
ezra .
wait , i have ... just one more thing to say .
aria marie montgomery ..
... will you marry me ?
this has to be our last round .
so a toast to friends new and old .
who &apos;s the extra for ?
babes and booze .
it &apos;s like you were expecting me .
noel kahn
did you miss me ?
