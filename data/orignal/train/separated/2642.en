华盛顿特区
I do apologize for keeping you waiting.
Mikhail Kozlov.
Are you the embassy intelligence chief?
We are not here to discuss my curriculum vitae, Agent Keen,
only to ascertain why you are here
and what you hope to accomplish
nowthat the F.B.I. has surrounded the embassy.
I am not here to speak to a pawn without adequate clearance.
Nor are we here to harbor foreign agents of the F.B.I.,
Agent Keen.
My name is Masha Rostova.
I am a deep cover operative
for the Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti.
I have successfully completed my mission
and am hereby seeking asylum.
I would appreciate an immediate and private audience
with your chief intelligence officer.
Звони.
I need to speak to whoever's in command of security,
and I need to do it now.
You understand?
Ressler.
I just got off the line with Reven Wright.
Did we get the go-ahead?
The State Department has requested
that the Russians bring her out.
Requested?
Nobody would be making a request if it was Bin Laden in there.
On U.S. soil? We'd be blasting our way in.
The Russian Embassy isn't U.S. soil.
That fence is a border.
Crossing it is tantamount to armed invasion.
It's literally an act of war.
I know, but look around.
The war's already started.
Agent Keen.
Or do you prefer "Rostova"?
第三季第二集
第80号
Connie, leave it.
Patience, golubushka. Duty calls.
Oh, Connie.
What a delightful nod to tradition.
I can't tell you how nostalgic it is
to see a Russian bureaucrat demonstrating
such a time-honored absence of work ethic.
Connie? Is someone here?
No, darling.
Keep the shower running. I'll be right in.
I bought us a toy.
She's much prettier than she looks
sitting behind the news anchor desk.
Get out.
Plus, she's married to a ranking member
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Only fair, I suppose, given the black book military aid
he's allocated to Crimea.
Reciprocity's a bitch, right Connie?
You screw the bear, the bear screws back.
Batteries Not Included.
By all means, do call in the troops.
What with your government's implication
in the O.R.E.A. bombing
and assassinations of the sitting senator
and the attorney general of the United States,
how much harm could a weekly game of water wiggle
between their ambassador and a senator's wife cause?
Barely a blip in the news cycle.
Though, I doubt the Kremlin
will be nearly as jejune as I am.
What do you want?
That's the spirit, Connie. Service with a smile.
The reason your underlings are so rudely interrupting
your weekly tryst is because Elizabeth Keen
turned herself in to your embassy
and has identified herself
as a deep cover F.S.B. agent in distress.
That's absurd.
Yes, quite.
Nevertheless, she's currently demanding diplomatic immunity.
And I want real-time reports of everything--
everything that occurs inside that building,
especially the names of every drone
in the decision loop between here and Moscow.
That won't present a problem, will it, Connie?
Duty calls, comrade.
Who are you?
Alexander Raskovich,
F.S.B. chief intelligence agent for Washington, D.C.,
which makes me senior intelligence agent
for the entire Western Hemisphere.
I am intimately acquainted with
every single Russian intelligence asset
in North and South America,
active and inactive.
And you, dear, are not one of them.
Which begs a question --
Why are you masquerading as such
when you and I both know you are no such thing?
I came here to protect myself, to get your help
because our interests are aligned.
Your country and I have been blamed for crimes
we did not commit.
It was committed by a global consortium
known in some quarters as the Cabal.
What are their objectives?
To reignite the cold war
between Russia and the United States.
And to what end?
I will tell you everything that I know
after I've been guaranteed, in writing,
diplomatic immunity.
How do I know that you're not working for the Cabal?
How do I know that you're not here posing as a victim
to gain safe passage away from the F.B.I.?
The Russian assassin, the one known as Karakurt.
Never heard of him.
He's been turned.
The Cabal framed me.
Who better than the daughter of a K.G.B. agent?
Katarina Rostova.
A K.G.B. agent was turned, but it wasn't me.
It was Karakurt. He's gone.
Check, and when you've confirmed he's missing,
draw up my immunity agreement.
Did we get the breach order?
Negative.
The Russians are denying the State Department's request.
They're not going to turn her in.
Is the White House involved? Are they gonna make the call?
We've been ordered to stand down.
They're harboring a terrorist.
The State Department has been very clear.
They want this handled diplomatically.
Hold your positions.
My superiors are willing to hear you out.
If they believe you, they will do what they can to help.
But not here.
You're being transferred to Moscow for debriefing.
Don't you see that's playing right into the Cabal's narrative?
The minute I leave U.S. soil,
my government will interpret that as a defection.
I have delivered a decision.
Choose, Agent Keen --
Moscow,
or you can take your chances with your compatriots outside.
Вы верены?
Да.
Да, я подожду.
Where's my wedding ring?
Bedside table, behind the Ben Wa balls.
You.
Me?
And I was so riveted... by her interview
with those identical triplets from Milwaukee.
Спасибо.
Agent Keen is leaving the embassy.
She's been arrested?
The Kremlin has ordered her transfer to Moscow.
Who in the Kremlin?
It was authorized by the Federal Tariff Service,
of all things.
Vitsin.
Удачи.
The package is in transit.
Excellent.
See Agent Keen to the airport.
Our people on the plane will take it from there.
Ressler.
Ressler, don't.
If you're gonna tell me that diplomatic vehicles
have the same protection as the embassy --
You know they do.
As long as she's inside that car,
she's on Russian soil. You can't touch her.
I can't let her go.
Ressler.
I know you're angry. So am I.
But how we feel is not important.
Taking her into custody is.
We are doing everything we can.
Are we? Really?
Within the law, yes, really.
Ressler.
Donald, you cannot let Agent Keen leave the embassy.
Oh, you want a favor?
How 'bout you come down here and ask him personally?
Her life depends on it.
'Cause I'd be more inclined to help if I had you in cuffs.
You cannot let her leave.
You're preaching to the choir 'cause she's already gone.
I received direct confirmation from the Russian ambassador
that Agent Keen's transfer was authorized
by a high-level apparatchik in the Federal Tariff Service,
a man named Vladimir Vitsin.
Vitsin?
Yes, the same man who signed the paperwork
facilitating Karakurt's entry into the United States.
He's an operative for the Cabal.
Any move he makes is in service to their agenda.
They're not transporting Agent Keen to Moscow for debriefing.
The second she gets on that plane --
She's dead.
You need to stop that convoy.
Keen.
"1-4-2-5 Peabody."
It's the best I could do. Full pension and benefits.
If I resign.
Yes, effective immediately.
In return, all charges against you will be dropped.
Agent Keen -- have you found her?
I can't discuss that with you.
Have you found Karakurt?
He's the terrorist, not her.
I took your case as far as the White House.
I talked to Laurel Hitchen. She's a friend.
She had to pull a lot of strings to get you this deal.
I appreciate what you've done, Reven. I do.
But -- - These are serious charges, Harold.
You could go to jail. Take the deal.
For you and for Charlene. Take it and move on.
If you accept the terms, Harold,
they'll drop the investigation.
If you refuse to play ball, pending the outcome,
you'll be reassigned, paper pushing at the C.J.I.S.,
cubicle, potted plant --
a dead end, Harold.
You're better than that.
Yes, I am.
You really want to do this?
No. What I wanna do is help.
You think I'm stupid, Carly?
You don't think I know what's going on?
What are you looking at, old man?
You all right?
No, I'm not all right.
Ressler tried to kill me.
Seeking asylum with the Russians was a dangerous decision.
I was out of options.
At least I would've been secure in Moscow right now.
If by "secure" you mean "dead," then yes, absolutely.
Ressler wasn't trying to kill you.
He was trying to save you.
The convoy was compromised.
You want? We got a few specials.
The best item on the menu is the pecan pie, right, Chui?
Family recipe.
I'll just have coffee, thanks.
You know him? We're safe here?
You threw yourself in the hands of the Cabal
the moment you got on that vehicle.
The only question was whether they'd kill you
before or after you entered Russian airspace.
Clayton, you're hurting me.
No.
You deaf, old man?
I told you to mind your own business.
Turn around, bitch.
Clayton...
Oh, here we go.
Carly...
What the hell? You lookin' to get yourself killed?
You haven't the slightest clue
how to speak to a woman, have you?
Now, my friend there and I
are having a very important discussion.
So you just sit tight, enjoy your muffin,
and if I hear you say anything
other than "Please" or "Thank you" to Carly,
I'm gonna drag you into the men's room
and wash your mouth out with soap.
And if that doesn't work,
I'll cut your filthy tongue out with that butter knife.
Is that clear enough for you?
Agent Ressler,
what part of "Stand down" don't you understand?
I was ordered to let Keen go and I did.
I wasn't ordered to let her die.
The transport was compromised.
Says who?
Reddington.
You spoke to him?
Yeah, he called.
Said the Cabal had hijacked Keen.
You countermanded a direct order
and attacked a diplomatic transport
on the word of one fugitive
in order to save the life of another?
And I'm willing to resign from the task force
if the intel that Reddington gave us is wrong.
The driver has been hospitalized.
As soon as he can be questioned,
we can confirm Reddington's information.
Okay, we've got a sighting.
Del Rio diner, 1425 Peabody Street.
Come on, pull it together.
An M.P.D.C. cruiser just pulled up out back.
What are you...
Behind the car!
All right.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain calm and take your seats.
Clayton.
Now what?
Now...I apologize.
I am terribly sorry for the inconvenience,
but it appears we'll all be taking an extended lunch.
However, if you remain calm and do exactly as I say,
I promise you'll leave here with a rip-roaring story
to tell your friends and families.
Bon appétit.
Dear, would you mind answering that phone?
No doubt it's for me.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I disturb you?
They said you were sedated.
Well, you know what they say?
Can't keep a good man down.
Unfortunately, It's only a matter of time
before the FBI pays you a visit
and we can't have that.
Because you, are what commonly referred to as...
a loose end.
Now, you should take heart,
because if the Russians are furious now,
imagine how irate they'll be
when they learn that there's been another fatality
as a result of Agent Ressler's attack on your convoy.
If it's any consolation,
your heroic devotion to our cause
has earned you my most sincere respect.
Godspeed, sir.
Godspeed.
What do you got?
Cut the power to the building, commandeered the phone lines.
Both suspects are still inside.
Both suspects?
Agent Keen and Raymond Reddington.
Keen.
We believe so, but he's got the hostages
positioned as human shields.
Can't get a clear view inside.
Well, then, let's find out.
What are you doing?
Hold fire.
Keen!
Keen!
Agent Ressler, excellent. Do you have a pen?
Because I'm ready to dictate a list of my demands.
I owe you, Keen.
You saved my life back at that convoy.
Now let me return the favor.
Come out before this gets bad.
It's already gone bad, and you're making it worse.
If you wanna repay me, do what Reddington says
before somebody else gets hurt.
That's not gonna happen, and you know it.
The scene's locked down.
Nowhere to go, and you got zero leverage
because I know you.
I know what you're capable of,
and you're not gonna hurt these people.
She won't, but I will. Ready?
My demands are as follows...
One, I want the immediate restoration of power
to this building.
Two, an armored vehicle to transport us
safely and unmolested
from this door to a runway of my choosing.
Three, bring me Marvin Gerard.
You have 90 minutes.
That's it?
After that, a hostage dies every half-hour.
That's it, Agent Ressler.
Marvin Gerard.
Graduated magna cum laude from Harvard
where, at the tender age of 31,
he was appointed the third youngest full professor
in the institution's history.
He served as a prosecutor for three years,
State of New York.
Later, he joined his father-in-law's
criminal defense firm as a full partner.
He was on the short list for an appointment
to the federal bench
when his marriage to the boss's daughter hit the skids.
Serves a year for attempting to kidnap their son,
gets disbarred.
Currently, he's incarcerated for 7 to 10
in the Cumberland F.C.I.
Although he's been disbarred, Gerard acts as shadow counsel
to some of the biggest players in the criminal underworld --
politicians, C.E.O.s...
and one Raymond Reddington.
Marvin Gerard?
Who are you? What am I doing here?
I'm Special Agent Samar Navabi.
You've been briefed?
Rousted out of bed, cavity-searched,
shackled, transported like livestock? Yes.
Briefed? No.
One of your former clients
is holding 17 civilians hostage in that diner.
He's demanded that we bring you here.
Which one?
Raymond Reddington.
I have nothing to do with this.
I don't know what he wants from me.
I am not going in here.
Well, you are going in.
If you can please disrobe.
Like hell!
Call my lawyer.
Who is your O.I.C.?
That would be me.
Gentlemen, help Mr. Gerard out of his, uh, jumpsuit.
This will never work.
If he asks me,
I'm gonna have to tell him that I'm wearing a wire.
It will be unethical for me to lie to my client.
Let the record reflect that I am complying under duress
and that my fourth amendment right to privacy
is being violated.
As is my right not to be nauseated.
Per Reddington's demands.
Unbelievable.
I'll get that, dear.
The first table over there.
This is not working.
Lizzy, please.
Take a seat.
I'll have Chui bring you a piece of pie.
I promise you'll thank me.
Cut it out. A lawyer?
How is that gonna help us with this?
Lawyers find an exploit loopholes.
It's what makes them so loathsome.
And Marvin Gerard...
is the most loathsome of them all.
That's what makes him so invaluable.
Speak of the devil.
Hello, Marvin.
My parole hearing is next week.
Christmas came early.
You think this is a gift?
They'll probably tack on five more years
just seeing you breathe in my direction.
Are you wired?
Of course I'm wired.
I told them not to bother.
I told you not to bother.
Elizabeth, Marvin Gerard,
criminal attorney...
One down.
Not necessarily in that order.
Finally.
I am in the presence of greatness.
You're the one.
You're the one who made him throw away his freedom.
Good God, Marv, let it go.
What? You asked for my advice.
I was simply giving you, as a friend,
a heads up regarding my plans.
You were a wonderful attorney.
And you were a terrible client.
Two.
Not that you're interested,
but, uh...
I just got engaged.
Becky Weinberg.
Becky from the old firm? The paralegal.
Oh, my God. You old dog.
Getting older by the minute.
You just extended my engagement about a decade with this stunt.
Now I'm never gonna make parole.
Becky and I -- she's not gonna wait around.
All right, Counselor, let's get down to business.
I have a situation that requires your undivided attention.
No, it doesn't. Turn yourselves in.
Marvin, hear me out. You don't have all the facts.
No? But I have eyes.
And I can see that you're in here, and they are out there.
And now you're gonna start in with me about how,
with you, there's always more than meets the eye.
No, stop!
Elizabeth!
Stop!
That's enough!
You broke his ribs.
Sounds like his lung is punctured.
You're hurting him.
That's the only way to stop the swelling.
What do you care?
I didn't want anybody to get hurt.
Really? Seemed to me like you wanted to hurt him bad.
She didn't have a choice.
What if he'd gotten her gun? What then, Carly?
Do you think any of us would be safer if he were armed?
You think you'd be safe?
What is he working on? A plea agreement?
Why else bring a lawyer in here other than to cut a deal?
If you think for one second that I am interested...
There will be no deal.
Then why go to all the trouble to bring him in here?
Doesn't make any sense.
Marvin Gerard was one of the most respected
defense attorneys on the Eastern Seaboard.
Perfect wife, perfect job, perfect, all of it...
Save for his son Timothy.
Quiet boy.
Fell in with some bad eggs, it seems.
Disciplinary issues, troubles at school, drug abuse.
Timothy was getting a steady supply of amphetamines
from his mother's shrink -- Ritalin, Adderall.
She constantly bullied the boy.
Marvin and his wife separated.
He fought for custody,
contacted police, social services.
But his wife was the princess in a very prominent
and powerful legal dynasty, so no action was ever taken.
Timothy remained in her sole custody.
Her abuse worsened.
Convinced he had no other option,
Marvin kidnapped the boy.
They tracked him down, of course.
Returned the child to his mother.
Marvin was disbarred, convicted, and incarcerated.
And what happened to his son?
A year later, Timothy hung himself.
He was 15.
Snipers in position for cover.
Teams make simultaneous entries here and here.
Flashbangs and smoke.
Secure and contain the scenario.
Counter minimal risk of collateral damage.
We're all set on my mark.
He can't do that, can he? Can you do that?
No. We don't have eyes inside.
Even a minimal risk of collateral damage is too much.
We wait.
Reddington's not gonna hurt anybody in that building.
Keen won't let him.
Same girl who shot the Attorney General?
That was different.
She's in over her head.
It's probably why they got spotted.
It wasn't her that was spotted.
Anonymous tip came in on Reddington, not Keen.
Get me that 9-1-1 call.
Raymond.
Did you read this?
Yes. It's the voice transcripts we recovered from the Fulcrum.
No, I didn't ask you if you recognize it.
I asked you if you read it --
Specifically section 39c, pages 216 to 217,
lines 5 through 19.
Here.
This can't be right.
God, no. It's all kinds of wrong.
This is a perilously fast run down a slippery road.
Granted, you'd have to hit all green lights, but...
Yeah, we could make it work.
He -- he can't breathe! Somebody help him!
No, not you! Get away from him!
His chest cavity is filling with blood.
His lungs are gonna collapse
if we don't get him medical attention
in the next 20 to 30 minutes tops.
Fine.
He'll be in Agent Ressler's capable care by then.
We're leaving.
Leaving?
Attention, everyone.
We're done here,
so if you could all be so kind as to gather up your belongings
and step into the kitchen.
Except you two. You stay right there.
Lucinda?
Chui, be a pal.
Wrap up two slices of that delicious pecan pie.
I spent five years tracking Reddington
and can count on one hand the number of times
we got a credible sighting.
I found the 9-1-1 call.
Wait a second.
I'm very disappointed, Donald.
I would've expected you of all people
would've understood that when I make a demand, it's just that.
Stalling is not tolerated.
We're doing the best we can, all right?
Why isn't the power back on?
Where's my armored vehicle?
We're working on it.
Work harder.
If the power isn't back in 60 seconds,
I'm gonna start shooting people.
Your time starts now.
Give him the power.
He's bluffing.
I can't take that chance.
Restore the power.
Counselor?
The least of your many talents, my friend.
He just looked right at me. It's him. It's Reddington.
That's Reddington.
He called the tip in on himself.
This whole thing, he wanted us to --
Breach! Breach now!
Okay, everyone, let's pack it up.
I'm sorry you have to burn this operation
on our account, Chui. It was a beautiful thing.
If only it lasted.
They'll be packed and long gone
before the F.B.I. ever gets down here.
This way.
Let's go! Go!
Kitchen! Kitchen!
They're not here.
Hell.
Get these people out of here.
They didn't just disappear. There's gotta be a way out.
Break down every wall if you have to.
Find them.
This is a bad situation, Red.
They will hunt me, and they will find me.
And when they do, do you know where I am going?
In a hole.
Do you like Tahiti?
Solitary. 23 hours a day.
There will be no parole
and no chance of seeing Becky again, that's for sure.
You're a free man, Marvin.
Instead of facing a notoriously unpredictable parole board
and the showering with the boys,
you'll be unwinding on a small banana plantation
I have outside of Papeete.
Becky.
Get in the car, Marvin.
Have a Mai Tai, soak up some sun
because I'll be contacting you soon, and when I do,
I want this plan of yours to be thoroughly mapped out.
We only have one shot at this.
I'll be in touch.
Make sure you have Heia air dry your sheets!
You'll sleep like a baby!
This whole thing, the diner,
it wasn't a hostage situation. It was a jail break.
Yes.
We're not gonna be able to fight our way out of this, Lizzy.
We're gonna have to think our way out.
You really think he can help?
I do.
Where do we go from here?
The owner's gone, the lawyer's gone,
and Red and Liz are gone.
Why would he go to all this trouble,
risk everything, just to free Marvin Gerard?
Put the word out.
They're in the wind, and we're back to square one.
You have no idea what I've offered Chui
to divulge the secret of this recipe.
He won't say.
I suspect it has something to do with how he beats his eggs.
I cannot stop thinking about that man from the diner...
I wonder if he uses a whisk.
His wife, the way she looked at me.
No one's ever looked at me like that before.
How do you do it?
Do what?
How do you deal with people looking at you that way?
The fear?
How do you go on knowing that people are terrified of you?
From as early as I can remember,
I dreamed of someday being captain of a ship.
To be out there on the ocean in the middle of the night,
navigating by the stars.
I always thought it would be the greatest life on earth.
The people you're talking about...
the ones who think they know you...
they really don't know anything about you at all.
I've never told anyone that before.
About a life at sea.
Why didn't you do it?
You went into Naval Intelligence instead.
It was the Cold War. There were spies to run.
The Cabal-- they blamed you for something you hadn't done.
Sailors have been navigating by the stars...
for thousands of years.
Odysseus spent a decade at war...
曾参加特洛伊战争
but his biggest battle was finding his way home.
I think you would've made a terrific captain.
I don't know.
You can't do every silly thing you want to in life.
You have to make your choices.
You have to try to be happy with them.
I think we've done pretty well.
I'm not saying it's easy to ignore
the way people look at you.
But I hope you can find some solace
in the fact that when I look at you...
♬I'll light the fire♬
♬You place the flowers♬
♬In the vase that you bought♬
♬Today♬

Your granddaughter got the antidote.
Now it's your turn.
We lost your boss,
and no one seems to know where he's gone.
But I have the sneaking suspicion...
that you do.
So...
where is Raymond Reddington?
We need to talk.
