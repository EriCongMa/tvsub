thought it was gonna be a good day .
mr. gregory had this way of making everyone feel good ,
even when we were painting over graffiti .
should be good to go .
give it a good stir first , okay ?
okay .
dante .
closest thing i ever had to a father .
bring that ladder over here .
okay , mr. gregory . want me to set it up ?
yeah .
but little t ...
he didn &apos;t like what mr. gregory stood for .
just like that ...
no !
... mr. gregory was gone .
is terrance jones ,
the man you know as little t ,
who you saw shoot elmore gregory ?
yeah , that &apos;s him .
can you describe the gun used in the shooting ?
it was a mac @-@ 10 , all black @-@ like , with a big barrel .
bad @-@ ass gun .
isn &apos;t it true that you were focused on the weapon ,
focused on saving yourself ?
yeah , but -- - so focused ,
you couldn &apos;t possibly see the shooter
because you were only looking at the gun .
isn &apos;t that true , mr. moore ?
trust me . the defense attorney will be worse .
answer the question , dante ,
just like we practiced .
i saw terrance jones kill elmore gregory .
it was little t.
good job . that &apos;s all you have to do tomorrow .
i think we &apos;re ready for trial .
good , &apos; cause i &apos;m starving .
meet you outside .
come on . let &apos;s get you to the hotel and get you fed .
just be yourself on the stand tomorrow , okay , dante ?
that &apos;s all you got to do .
you &apos;ll be there with me ?
the whole time .
come on .
i want to thank you for being the only guy
with the guts to stand up to little t.
i &apos;m standing up for mr. gregory .
it will be very intimidating
when you see terrance jones in the courtroom .
i &apos;m buggin &apos; a little .
little t &apos;s homies are looking for me .
oh , don &apos;t worry about it , all right ?
they &apos;re not gonna find you .
um , this is officer jermaine walker ,
and he will be outside your hotel room all night .
how you doing ? i &apos;ll make sure nothing happens .
you have my word .
all right .
see you tomorrow . order a steak .
no , no , no , no . don &apos;t .
i &apos;m concerned about promise , reward , and inducement .
the defense attorney could come after us
if we give him anything -- you know that .
you can &apos;t lock him in a room
and not give him food .
just keep it modest .
order a steak , all right , but a cheap one .
and watch a movie .
for real ?
yeah .
keep it clean , right ?
see you in the morning .
yeah . okay .
&quot; reward and inducement &quot; ?
like dante &apos;s gonna risk his life
to testify for a free steak ?
valerie delgado is a great prosecutor .
i know , i know . the best there is .
she &apos;s never lost a murder trial .
but ?
just wish she &apos;d lighten up a little bit .
valerie delgado says your witness is prepped .
yeah , i think he &apos;s good to go , sir .
keep up the good work .
we all want this guy .
i &apos;ve been waiting for this day for a long time .
little t is responsible for at least 15 murders .
remember when we almost got him with the drive @-@ by
of the grandmother and the 8 @-@ year @-@ old kid ?
that witness &quot; disappeared &quot;
when terrance jones was charged .
since then , no one has come forward
until dante stepped up .
so , how does a white female cop
get the confidence of a black kid from the hood ?
i have mad skills .
no .
korsak &apos;s the one that got us his fingerprints on the weapon .
no big deal .
yes , it is !
you &apos;re the one who found the c.i.
who told us that the gun was still in little t &apos;s car .
yeah , we caught a few breaks on this one .
i want to look professional on the stand . which one ?
hmm . what &apos;s that music i &apos;m hearing ?
what music ?
oh , it &apos;s your ties , singing disco songs .
all right , armani . what would you wear ?
let &apos;s see .
uh , where &apos;s the other one ?
the other one ?
this is two @-@ for @-@ one from the gentleman &apos;s warehouse , right ?
god , you know what ?
go away , please .
he &apos;s right . i got no sense of style .
oh , come on . he &apos;s just messing with you .
here . wear this one .
goes nice with your eyes .
thank you .
you are taking forever . come on .
you haven &apos;t touched your mulberry leaves
or the wheatgrass .
bass , you love your opuntia cactus pads !
oh ! oh , my god .
you scared me .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i just wanted to watch something on your plasma .
oh . you &apos;re a bill o &apos;reilly fan ?
he has the most beautiful irish blue eyes .
i @-@ i hope you don &apos;t mind ,
but the tv in the guest house just doesn &apos;t do them justice .
well , they look like contacts .
no !
yeah , paris hilton wears them , too .
i didn &apos;t think you read tabloids .
oh , no . i read that in ophthalmological monthjournal .
yeah . of course .
so , why is the sound off ?
oh . mr. o &apos;reilly &apos;s very bright but a little opinionated .
and he gets on my nerves when i listen to him .
well , neurological studies show
that listening to someone you disagree with
helps stimulate the brain .
oh , i &apos;m stimulated watching him .
oh , turn it up !
this is why i &apos;m watching .
elmore gregory was one of the good guys --
a young father of two
who stood up to drug dealers and paid with his life .
here he is on &quot; the factor &quot; two years ago .
i say put your xbox down ,
get your paint rollers and your courage ,
and stand up to these drug dealers ...
that &apos;s jane &apos;s case .
i know .
bill o &apos;reilly &apos;s in town to cover it .
isn &apos;t it exciting ?
this man , rerrance &quot; little t &quot; jones ,
goes on trial tomorrow .
boston homicide detectives apparently have an eyewitness
who is prepared to identify jones
as the killer of a good man , a patriot ...
why is your door unlocked ?
hey , ma -- okay , i couldn &apos;t find any sour patch ,
so you got to settle with gummi bears .
it &apos;s good .
no . no , no , no , no , no . turn that crap off , ma .
uh , ane , o &apos;reilly is doing --
off , all right ?
we all know you &apos;re in love with b.o.
don &apos;t call him that .
off !
too bad , since he &apos;s doing the whole show on your case .
what ?
but since you &apos;re not interested --
wait . no . turn it back on .
ma , turn it back on !
now tomorrow
the trial of terrance jones begins ,
look , it &apos;s you !
and we will be there .
boston police say he &apos;s a suspect
in at least 15 other murders .
now homicide detectives finally have jones
right where they want him --
facing a jury for killing a man who stood up to him .
let &apos;s hope there will finally be justice
for this father of two
who wasn &apos;t afraid to speak up for what &apos;s right .
wow . wouldn &apos;t that be something ?
yes , it would .
hey , ma , can you make me some eggs ?
sure !
thank you .
i can &apos;t believe she has the hots for bill o &apos;reilly .
&quot; his irish blue eyes &quot; ?
vomit .
well , studies show that men with great earning potential
are still the most desirable mate .
she &apos;s too old to mate .
rizzoli !
at least that stops her from falling for stanley .
how many times i got to tell you ?
the jelly doughnuts don &apos;t go here .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , mr . stanley .
look at this mess .
you got strawberry jelly on the sprinkles .
oh , that &apos;s a problem .
stanley has obsessive @-@ compulsive disorder .
the two doughnuts making contact is very upsetting for him .
good .
rizzoli .
all right , we &apos;ll be right there .
gang @-@ related shooting . let &apos;s go .
what do we got ?
victim &apos;s male , african @-@ american , early 20s .
gang affiliation ?
no one &apos;s talking .
some things never change .
oh , god . no .
jane , who is it ?
oh , god .
it &apos;s dante , my witness .
how did he get here ? there was a guard right outside his hotel door .
frost is checking it out .
little t ordered this hit from jail .
how &apos;d they find him ?
i talked him into this , korsak .
you &apos;re not responsible for this .
yeah , i am .
rigor indicates he &apos;s been dead about eight hours .
so he was killed last night .
one gunshot wound to the back of the head .
it &apos;s a close contact , execution style .
hey . i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here . you believe this ?
what i can &apos;t believe is how you let this happen .
oh ! nobody let this happen .
lividity suggests he &apos;s been lying here six to eight hours .
yeah , and yet nobody thought to call it in .
i don &apos;t see any blood or brain matter .
he wasn &apos;t killed here .
i want an internal affairs investigation
into that officer you put on the hotel room .
really ? you think that &apos;s the most important thing right now ?
dante &apos;s dead , valerie .
you vouched for that officer , jane .
if we &apos;re getting technical ,
his safety was her responsibility .
let &apos;s not play the blame game .
i just want to find out who did this .
his wallet &apos;s still here .
did you see his phone ?
no .
i &apos;ll get a subpoena going for his phone records .
right . i want to take a look at
that hotel room myself and talk to walker .
go . i &apos;ll handle this .
can you handle her ?
the guy with three ex @-@ wives ? psh !
that &apos;s what i thought .
okay .
i looked at the surveillance tape .
he &apos;s telling the truth .
how is that possible ?
walker never left his post .
dante never left the room .
front desk says no calls on the room phone ,
no card @-@ key activity on the door , just room service .
did we check the room @-@ service guy ?
clean .
what time was it when you last saw dante ?
look , he was fine .
i saw him when they brought his dinner .
what time was it ?
it was 8 : 53 p.m.
look , i come from the same project .
i know what it took
for him to stand up to someone like little t.
jermaine , it &apos;s okay . nobody &apos;s blaming you for this .
he barely touched his burger .
he was starving . he hadn &apos;t eaten all day .
something big must have interrupted him .
or someone called him on his cellphone .
he was a foster kid . he bounced from home to home .
no family . so who ?
maybe a friend he trusted .
who lured him to his death .
no signs of a struggle .
jermaine , did you open the window ?
it was hot when we came into the room .
dante opened it .
excuse me . can you dust the sill for me ?
look at the way the prints are facing .
looks like the prints are facing outward ,
like he was hanging from the window .
hmm . you think he climbed out ?
i don &apos;t know , jane . it &apos;s two stories .
it &apos;s a long drop .
do you see any other way for him to get out of here ?
what the hell made him bolt ?
what does the loss of your witness do to your case ?
it &apos;s not good , but we &apos;ve still got
the gun with terrance jones &apos; prints ,
and i &apos;ve never lost a murder trial .
wow , that &apos;s impressive .
oh , crap . i &apos;ve got a flat .
wouldn &apos;t be surprised if a gangbanger slashed my tire .
damn .
oh , no . it wasn &apos;t slashed .
looks like you ran over a roofing nail .
the last time i called peppy road service ,
it took them like four peppy hours .
i &apos;ll be here all day .
i &apos;ll change it for you .
no . what ? you don &apos;t have to do that . it &apos;s fine .
no , no . it &apos;s okay .
just need to get the right footwear for the job .
you sure you don &apos;t want my help ?
no , thank you , sergeant .
i like to keep my skill set fresh .
i feel bad , watching you do it all by yourself .
don &apos;t . she &apos;s faster than peppy .
it &apos;s a dicey neighborhood .
you want me to wait around with you ?
she can take care of herself .
no , it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;ll see you back at headquarters .
he really thinks we &apos;re incompetent .
no , he doesn &apos;t .
he &apos;s just , uh , protective .
why is it men always think that women ,
we don &apos;t know what the hell we &apos;re doing ?
actually , there are exciting advances
in brain mapping and genetic research
that prove some stereotypes are true .
really ? what , like men are better drivers ?
yes . actually , probably due to testosterone .
seems they have an advantage in spatial ability .
okay , don &apos;t tell my colleagues that , please .
all right . there you go .
you can drive on the spare ,
but you should get a new tire .
let me ask you -- what &apos;s science have to say
about the chances of a woman who can &apos;t change her own tire
becoming the next d.a. ?
excellent .
the prints from the window sill belong to dante .
you started the autopsy ?
just about to .
oh , yuck .
it &apos;s delgado , asking me again , for the 400th time ,
if i &apos;ve filed a 1920 .
i thought i &apos;d memorized all your cop talk .
you know , &quot; code 10 . &quot; that &apos;s lunch .
and &quot; i &apos;m off for a personal . &quot;
that &apos;s when you have to do number two .
stop .
1920 is the internal @-@ affairs complaint form ...
... which i &apos;m not filing ,
because walker had nothing to do with this .
you know , she &apos;s very nice if you approach her in the right way .
yeah , i thought so , too ,
but now i think grizzly bears are nicer .
ursus horribilis .
grizzly bear . it &apos;s a remarkably bad @-@ tempered creature .
it &apos;s ursus delgado .
again .
more like ursus americanus . black bears .
but they rarely attack
unless they &apos;ve had a bad berry year .
but when they do , watch out .
so delgado had a bad berry year ?
she wants to be the d.a. ,
so she has to be tough .
oh , and i was gonna vote for her ,
but if she doesn &apos;t quit calling me ,
she can forget it .
hi , honey ! did you hear the great news ?
north korea has a new leader ?
no . bill o &apos;reilly &apos;s having a book signing tonight .
wow . can &apos;t wait .
but mr. stanley won &apos;t let me leave .
jane , maybe you could , um , take me later
and badge me to the front of the line ?
have frankie take you .
take you where ?
yeah .
it could be payback for
all the metallica concerts he made you take him to .
you &apos;re right . i nearly forgot .
i couldn &apos;t hear for three days after that last one .
noise @-@ induced hearing loss .
exposure to noise levels over 85 decibels can cause damage .
i missed the beginning of this conversation .
what the hell are we talking about ?
bill o &apos;reilly is having a book signing ,
and ma wants you to take her
so you can badge her to the front of the line .
oh . no . have fun .
so ...
how much clout does the m.e. have in this town ?
oh , look at the time !
we have so much work to do .
i &apos;ll take you .
you will ? !
no , maura . mnh @-@ mnh @-@ mnh @-@ mnh .
oh . bring your badge .
i look forward to it .
yes !
the last book signing i went to
was &quot; organ pathology essentials . &quot;
and you didn &apos;t invite me ?
diameter of the entry wound is 9.1 millimeters .
puts the bullet in the .38 @-@ caliber family .
cheap gun one of little t &apos;s underlings
wouldn &apos;t mind tossing .
can you help me with his shirt ?
yeah , sure .
he just wanted to be like elmore gregory , you know ?
stand up to the bad guy ,
make the world a better place .
&quot; destiny . &quot;
a predetermined course of events .
which led him here .
god , what a waste .
this could be peat moss on the bottom of his shoe .
i &apos;ll have the crime lab analyze it .
you &apos;re not gonna find any of that
in the projects or at the hotel .
that could tell us where he was killed .
yeah .
oh , hello . and how are you ?
maura , you &apos;re talking to a shoe .
crushed husk of arthropod larvae
embedded in his tread .
and an exoskeleton .
so ? you found a cockroach .
i &apos;ll alert the media .
they &apos;re all over the place at the franklin street projects .
don &apos;t assume it &apos;s a cockroach .
there are thousands of different arthropods .
i &apos;ll consult a forensic entomologist .
he should be able to i.d. the species .
oh , crap . i got to get to court .
without my witness .
at least you still have the murder weapon .
yeah . we &apos;ll get him , maura .
at this time , your honor ,
the defense requests a motion to dismiss .
what ? he can &apos;t do that .
on what grounds , your honor ?
the prosecution can &apos;t prove its case .
they can no longer produce their witness .
yeah , because your client killed him !
hey , i didn &apos;t kill no one .
shh , shh . shh , shh .
they &apos;re trying to frame me is what they &apos;re trying to do .
mr. wooster , if you don &apos;t silence your client ,
i will have him removed .
defense has a good point , counselor .
your witness is dead .
we plan to present the murder weapon
with the defendant &apos;s prints on it , your honor .
fruit of the poisonous tree , your honor .
motion to suppress .
no , he can &apos;t do that .
that &apos;s so ridiculous .
that weapon was lawfully seized
by virtue of a search warrant , your honor .
the defense can show that warrant was issued based upon
a false statement by sergeant detective korsak .
what ? !
that &apos;s enough , detective .
please explain , ms. delgado .
sergeant korsak stated
he got the information from a person
known to the commonwealth .
he will be able to produce
his confidential informant to the court .
sergeant korsak ?
are you prepared to produce your informant ?
no , your honor .
you have two days to think this over , sergeant .
produce your informant ,
or this case is dismissed .
court is adjourned .
can &apos;t pin no murder on me .
you better produce your c.i. ,
or that smug asshole is gonna walk .
i can &apos;t , jane .
i can &apos;t .
i have no idea where he is .
i haven &apos;t talked to him
since we investigated gregory &apos;s murder .
you &apos;ll find him .
he lived off the grid .
i don &apos;t even think i had a phone number for him .
i &apos;m gonna hit the street .
it &apos;s the only chance i have of finding him .
you want company ?
no . stay here and work dante &apos;s murder .
what ?
unh @-@ unh . korsak did not make up his informant .
didn &apos;t say that .
you didn &apos;t have to .
your raised eyebrow said it for you .
don &apos;t tell me it hasn &apos;t crossed your mind .
korsak was my partner for years .
there is no way he would break the rules .
even for a dirtbag like little t ?
korsak &apos;s been after him since he came up to homicide .
he finally gets a chance to put him away .
would you blame him for breaking the rules ?
no . and neither would you ,
but the justice system would .
i &apos;m gonna go see if maura has anything .
how &apos;s it going ?
i &apos;m teaching frankie about the post @-@ mortem interval
based on ... stomach contents .
everybody &apos;s talking about it .
his stomach contents ?
i &apos;d do it , too -- fabricate a c.i.
to take down little t .
oh , hey . korsak did not make up an informant ,
and if you want to work in homicide ,
you don &apos;t ever let anybody hear you talking like that .
all right ?
okay . okay . sorry .
bad news . undigested iceberg lettuce .
oh , gosh . i have to sit down . that terrible news .
it is ?
no .
that &apos;s just maura news .
good news -- undigested ground beef .
i can &apos;t tell what grade it is .
yippee . can you tell what market it came from ?
i &apos;m ignoring you .
sesame seeds , white bread ...
all undigested .
wait . dante &apos;s food was undige ,
that is interesting news .
why ?
hamburger typically takes two hours to digest .
means he died less than two hours after he ate ?
very good .
thin , white coating on his tongue .
it could be oral thrush .
fabulous find . no , thank you .
it &apos;s minty .
since when is oral thrush minty ?
it isn &apos;t .
i suspect this may turn out to be residue from a breath mint .
but we didn &apos;t find any breath mints in dante &apos;s things .
which means what , frankie ?
he had bad breath ?
think .
all right ?
dante hadn &apos;t eaten all day ,
he didn &apos;t finish his burger ,
so why does he pop a breath mint
right before he &apos;s killed ?
so , the question is , who gave it to him ?
yes , and where was he that he felt
comfortable enough to suck on a mint ?
maybe dante was meeting a chick .
a chick ?
he might be right .
i mean , what else or who else could have lured him
out of the safety of that hotel room ?
well , he had no family , no girlfriend ,
nobody in his life for little t to intimidate .
little t &apos;s crew used a girl .
that is genius , frankie .
how do we solve murders without you ?
are you this rude to all your colleagues ?
korsak , any luck ?
i &apos;m working on it .
oh . got dante &apos;s cellphone records .
last incoming call -- 8 : 55 .
two minutes after room service dropped his burger off .
it &apos;s from a burn phone .
can &apos;t you trace it ?
no . it &apos;s all the rage with the gangbangers .
all right . well , any other calls ?
what &apos;s this one at 8 : 30 ?
oh ! and there it is again .
there it is again . he called it a lot .
it comes back to relita washington .
address is in the franklin street projects .
gee , that sure looks like a chick .
i &apos;m waiting for an apology .
have a seat . you &apos;ll be waiting a long time .
again with the rude remarks .
that &apos;s someone i &apos;d pop a breath mint for .
relita .
yes ?
i &apos;m detective rizzoli . this is detective frost .
can we come in ?
do you know a dante moore ?
who ?
i don &apos;t know who you &apos;re talking about .
well , maybe destiny does .
we need to talk .
we kept it a secret . we had to .
dante was too afraid little t would find out .
he was a good guy , dante .
he loved our baby so much .
you know , that &apos;s why he was testifying .
he said he didn &apos;t want our daughter growing up
in a world ruled by fear , you know ?
when was the last time you spoke to dante ?
yesterday after he got to the hotel .
he said he was scared ,
but there was a cop who was on the door watching him .
were you supposed to meet him last night ?
no . no way .
no , he wasn &apos;t leaving that hotel room .
he was too afraid little t &apos;s boys would be looking for him .
he wasn &apos;t going nowhere ,
especially near the projects .
do you know of anyone he might have talked to ,
anyone who could have convinced him to leave ?
the only one he really trusted was you .
i wish he &apos;d trusted me enough
to tell me about you and destiny .
why ? maybe we &apos;d be dead , then , too .
nobody could protect him from little t .
we &apos;re gonna get him , okay ? we will .
little t &apos;s gonna be free , like he always is .
that &apos;s not true , all right ?
we won &apos;t let that happen .
i won &apos;t let that happen .
104 .
i mean , what if we don &apos;t get in ?
oh , we &apos;ll get in .
it &apos;s really a prestigious thing
to be the chief medical examiner
of the commonwealth of massachusetts .
thank you .
can i see your badge ?
this would definitely mean an autograph from mr. o &apos;reilly .
you just have to ... show ... the guy ...
wait . no , no , no , no . no , no , no .
i heard he &apos;s gonna stop signing soon .
what ?
oh , no ! maura , come on .
okay . okay . come on .
get in the back of the line .
commonwealth business .
this is my , uh , coworker .
i can &apos;t believe it . it &apos;s him !
hey , you pinheads . you can &apos;t cut .
we &apos;re patriots on official business , mister .
hi . what &apos;s your name ?
her adrenal glands are over @-@ producing adrenaline .
it dilates the blood vessels and makes it hard to talk .
fascinating . what &apos;s her name ?
angela . angela rizzoli .
thank you , madeline .
with two z &apos;s .
is this beautiful young lady your daughter ?
yes . this is madeline .
oh , i have a daughter , too . her name is jane .
detective jane rizzoli ?
yes , of -- of course you know her .
you &apos;re covering her case .
i &apos;d love to get her on &quot; the factor . &quot;
oh , i &apos;m sure she would love to be your guest .
excellent .
let me give you her cellphone number .
angela .
it &apos;s 617 ...
no .
555 ...
30 ...
excuse me .
here &apos;s what doesn &apos;t make sense --
dante told relita he &apos;s staying put .
then he gets a call from a burn phone ,
and he jumps out a window .
rizzoli .
oh ! very funny .
who &apos;s that ?
said it was bill o &apos;reilly .
for the love of pete .
you call me again ,
i &apos;ll arrest you for harassing a police officer .
i said forget it !
i &apos;d love to , sergeant , but if i &quot; forget it , &quot;
a murderer walks .
how about you do what you &apos;ve been ordered to do ?
that doesn &apos;t sound good .
okay , read my lips --
i don &apos;t know where my c.i. is .
is that clear enough for you ?
hey , show some respect , sergeant .
ms. delgado &apos;s just trying to do her job ,
which is more than i can say for you .
the judge has ordered you to present the informant .
i want his name , and i want it now .
vince , you got to give her the name ,
even if you don &apos;t know where he is .
no . all the judge said was &quot; bring him to court . &quot;
i can &apos;t .
we call it a &quot; confidential informant &quot; for a reason !
where &apos;s your paperwork for this c.i. ?
oh , my god .
you did make him up , didn &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s not the judge you have to worry about now , sergeant .
it &apos;s me . i &apos;ll see you go to prison for this .
either give me a name or give me your badge .
boston homicide detectives unlocked the jail door
and let a drug @-@ dealing murderer back out onto the street .
that &apos;s an outrage .
and it makes me wonder ,
are they corrupt , too ?
oh , my god .
the cops get their young witness , dante moore ,
murdered while in their custody .
but that &apos;s not all .
sources now tell me sergeant detective vince korsak ,
lead investigator on the case ,
even fabricated a confidential informant .
so it looks like not only is their case gone ...
please turn it off .
... but respect for the entire boston --
i want to be alone .
too bad .
i know how long you &apos;ve wanted little t.
vince , we all know that .
everything o &apos;reily said about me is true .
it just ...
isn &apos;t the truth .
what do you mean ?
nothing .
i &apos;ve known you a long time , vince korsak .
and i know you &apos;re holding something back .
you know where your c.i. is .
you &apos;ve known the entire time .
you can &apos;t go down for this , vince .
we &apos;ve already lost one witness .
i can &apos;t guarantee his safety .
think about the safety of all the dantes
and all the elmore gregorys in the world .
15 murders little t is responsible for .
15 .
tell me the name of your c.i.
please .
i can &apos;t .
i don &apos;t agree with you ,
but i respect what you &apos;re doing .
come on . i &apos;ll take you home .
leave me alone , jane .
okay .
what are you doing ?
he &apos;s not going down for this -- not on my watch .
korsak &apos;s too careful .
even if the c.i. does exist ,
you said cavanaugh couldn &apos;t find a name in his file .
well , here &apos;s what we know --
the informant is listed as
&quot; a person known to the commonwealth . &quot;
that means the informant is not a criminal .
so his c.i. didn &apos;t give up the location of the gun
in exchange for a reduced sentence .
so that leaves money , payback , or ...
a person doing a good deed .
go up against little t and tell a cop
where the murder weapon is ?
that &apos;s a hell of a good deed .
he interviewed hundreds of people .
yeah .
so ... exclude any name with an address ...
or a follow @-@ up interview .
not following you .
korsak &apos;s protecting this informant .
that means , the only thing we &apos;re gonna find
is a name , all by itself --
that &apos;ll be the giveaway .
and that &apos;s the name of the informant .
you have mad skills .
frost , i got it .
i got a name .
you sure ?
damn , i think you &apos;re right .
where you going ?
to convince the c.i. to do the right thing .
not without backup .
little t &apos;s already back in charge here .
the elevators are out .
he &apos;s saying this is his turf .
yo , sister five @-@ o .
what you comin &apos; up here for ? to be my shortie ?
step away , punk @-@ ass bitch !
&quot; bitch &quot; was a nice touch .
wasn &apos;t too much ?
no , no , no . it was nice . i liked it .
okay .
never tell korsak this , but ...
i always admired the guy .
because he &apos;d rather lose everything that he &apos;s worked for
than take a chance that somebody &apos;d hurt his c.i. ?
yeah .
hi , relita .
can we come in ?
my head feels like an anvil dropped on it .
this better be good .
it is .
what the hell ?
your confidential informant
doesn &apos;t really look like a &quot; he , &quot; korsak .
hi , sergeant .
you don &apos;t have to do this , relita .
relita understands that dante sacrificed his life
so his daughter wouldn &apos;t have to grow up
around the same violence that he did .
detective rizzoli told me what you were willing to do .
i have to do this .
for you , for dante .
but mostly for destiny .
thank you .
thank detective rizzoli .
i wouldn &apos;t have come forward without her .
i forgot some files i need to pick up at work .
there are two uniforms outside the apartment .
don &apos;t take your eyes off her .
i &apos;ll see you at the hearing at 2 : 00 ?
yeah .
did you tell delgado ?
no .
i saved that for you .
hello , stanley .
hello , rizzoli .
that &apos;s nice . have you two become friends ?
mm @-@ hmm . watch this .
stanley .
the ketchup top is making contact
with the napkin dispenser .
what are you doing ? don &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m not sorry .
detective rizzoli ?
yeah ?
you hung up on me .
i did ?
that was really you ?
both times .
how did you get my number ?
you need to come on &quot; the factor , &quot;
talk about the story -- it &apos;s important .
i &apos;ve got nothing to say to you . you , either .
i respect police work more than any other profession .
oh , yeah . i can tell by the hatchet job you did on my partner .
if we made a mistake ,
come on the program , set the record straight .
i don &apos;t think you should , jane .
you can be a very mean man .
you weren &apos;t very nice to barney frank .
although i did think it was rude when he called you boorish .
appreciate it .
oh . i &apos;m sorry . this is urgent . it &apos;s about arthropods .
my grandfather , john o &apos;reilly --
member of the nypd in the 1930s .
i still have his billy club .
well , keep it away from your detractors .
jane .
yeah .
i got to show you something important .
okay .
if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have murders to solve .
detective , elmore gregory was a great man .
no one wants to see terrance jones get away with his murder .
come on the program .
maybe somebody will see it ,
come forward with information .
it could help .
no , thanks .
i &apos;m sorry i called you mean .
you &apos;re not nearly as awful in person .
thank you .
i know a really nice italian restaurant
in the north end , and i get off early today .
i cannot believe she just said that .
the foremost expert in forensic entomology
identified the larva on dante &apos;s shoe .
what am i looking at ?
the asian longhorn beetle .
it &apos;s an exotic pest .
do you realize what a big break this is ?
no , but i didn &apos;t spend my life playing with bug larva .
there has been a recent infestation of the asian longhorn .
please don &apos;t tell me that they &apos;re marching to my apartment .
they &apos;re only found in this one area -- loyalist park .
wait , are you saying that dante
could have been killed in this park ?
oh , no -- i &apos;m only able to conclusively say
that dante &apos;s shoes were in loyalist park
the night he was murdered .
okay , you know what ?
you are officially ridiculous .
his shoes didn &apos;t go there by themselves . come on , maura !
even you have to admit this looks like blood .
it is a reddish @-@ brown substance consistent with blood .
big concession . thank you very much .
okay . what about this ?
this brain matter right here .
it appears to be human tissue .
i think we just found the spot where dante was killed .
jane .
yes ?
found some fresh tire tracks .
okay . can you make a cast of the tire impressions ?
copy that . i &apos;ll get csru on it .
jane , it &apos;s a right rear tire .
can you tell me the manufacturer ?
road ready .
well , that &apos;s not gonna help . it &apos;s too common .
this impression -- it &apos;s from a nail .
and it &apos;s from a roofing nail .
you have a funny look on your face .
i feel a little bit sick .
i recognize this tire tread .
where &apos;s ms. washington ?
i don &apos;t have much time to prep her .
she &apos;s changing her baby &apos;s diaper .
well , tell her to leave the baby and come with me .
you didn &apos;t change your spare tire .
i &apos;ve been a little busy .
but that is your car , isn &apos;t it , counselor ?
what are they doing ?
why are they in my car ?
your flat tire .
we found the same tire tread
in the place where dante was murdered .
it &apos;s like finding a fingerprint .
oh , hey . korsak .
that &apos;s a .38 revolver , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah . .38 .
stupid to leave it in your car .
you learn that from little t ?
okay , i , um ...
i will testify against mr. jones .
he &apos;s the one who set this whole thing up .
that &apos;s who you want .
what did you say to dante on the burned phone
to get him to jump two stories ?
i told him ...
i told him , um ,
the officer outside his door was -- was dirty .
and i drove him to the woods .
and you shot him .
please . please . please , i will give you little t.
you won &apos;t ever get him without me .
i went through your case files .
you &apos;ve never lost a case .
nobody &apos;s that good , counselor .
unless they have terrance jones in their pocket .
he gave you everything you needed to win those cases --
witnesses , evidence , anybody you needed to disappear .
and all you had to do was bag any case against him .
put your hands behind your back .
you are under arrest for the murder of dante moore .
we have a deal !
there &apos;s not gonna be any deal .
you cannot bring him down unless i testify !
we don &apos;t need you . we &apos;ve got my c.i.
i want a lawyer .
i hope you know someone who &apos;s better at it than you are .
you sure you don &apos;t want a little hair of the dog ?
no , my head &apos;s still pounding .
valerie delgado , the assistant district attorney
who was arrested today for the murder of dante moore ,
will be arraigned tomorrow ,
all thanks to the work of two of boston &apos;s finest ,
detective jane rizzoli
and sergeant detective vincent korsak .
he &apos;s really very nice .
you &apos;ll remember these two
initially arrested drug dealer terrance jones ...
look , everybody ! that &apos;s my daughter , jane !
... who is accused of murdering
community activist elmore gregory .
a new prosecutor has been assigned to the case .
in the meantime ...
o &apos;reilly &apos;s really not that bad .
my mother , on the other hand ...
are you telling me you like him ?
wha -- i am so gonna tell your mother .
tell me what ?
that you need a new hangout .
did you get your badge back ?
yeah .
nice .
you know , uh , angela really likes badges .
she does ?
i do .
don &apos;t you call them &quot; badge bunnies &quot; ?
i guess that makes me one .
oh , my god . i cannot believe --
do you even know what that means ?
thank you , maura . thank you very , very much .
what ? what did i do ?
you know , i think you just bruised
my extensor hallucis longus .
good .
i don &apos;t even know what that is .
what ?
