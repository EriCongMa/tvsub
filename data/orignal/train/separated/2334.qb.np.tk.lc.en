for over a century , i have lived in secret
until now . i know the risk .
but i have to know her .
there &apos;s a tomb underneath the church .
a spell sealed katherine in that tomb , protecting her .
i &apos;m gonna bring her back .
she &apos;s not there !
you saved everyone in the church ?
we &apos;ve taken up residence in a farmhouse just outside of town .
all 25 vampires ?
some .
i hate this house . i didn &apos;t stay locked up for 145 years
to end up locked up here .
so , where &apos;s bethanne ?
she won &apos;t be coming back .
my wife iisabelle spent her life
researching paranormal activity in this area .
what have you done to my wife ?
i turned her .
maybe there is such a thing as vampires .
they &apos;re just different from the way we always thought they were .
you got a problem with blood , anna ?
i knew this girl vicki .
she was attacked by an animal , a bite to the neck .
and then i saw your face .
why would you confront me about it ?
because maybe it &apos;s true about vicki .
and also because i want you to turn me .
i love storms .
is that a vampire thing ?
&apos;cause i read vampires don &apos;t like running water .
it &apos;s only dracula .
he was a complete wuss .
never showered . very smelly .
seriously ?
first rule about vampires ...
don &apos;t believe anything you read .
you gotta tell me more . i gotta know .
no , you don &apos;t .
&apos;cause you &apos;re not gonna be one .
come on , you can &apos;t keep saying &quot; no &quot; to me .
look , i &apos;m not gonna turn someone
who learned everything he knows about vampires from netflix .
that &apos;s not true , and you know it .
why do you even want this ?
give me one good reason .
&apos;cause i ...
hmm . let me know when you can finish that sentence .
hey , you &apos;re still up .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
looks like the there &apos;s a big storm rolling in .
can you help make sure all the windows are closed ?
yeah . yeah . sure .
we &apos;re running low on blood .
you might wanna send anna to the hospital to get some more .
i &apos;ll send her out for some tomorrow .
maybe i could go with her .
if the storm keeps it dark enough ,
i might be able to go out during the day , no sun and all .
i &apos;m afraid not .
not after your stunt at the salvatore house tonight .
he and his brother deserved it .
and where did that get you ?
your girlfriend bethanne is dead .
and you have no one to blame but yourself .
we cannot live our lives about revenge .
we have to have better control of our emotions .
i understand , miss pearl .
i just wish i knew what you were up to .
i &apos;m going to make an exploratory visit into town tomorrow
to assess who &apos;s under the influence of vervain and who isn &apos;t .
anna tells me that the players haven &apos;t changed much .
it &apos;s still the lockwoods , the forbes , the fells ...
we should kill every last one of them .
we are smarter than that , frederick .
these people are not our enemies .
we don &apos;t hold grudges and resentments .
we &apos;ll get our town back .
we just have to have patience .
you heard her .
no revenge .
patience .
self @-@ control .
she seems to have it all figured out , doesn &apos;t she ?
i say we go to pearl &apos;s , bust down the door ,
and annihilate the idiot that attacked us last night .
and then what ?
we turn to the rest of that house of vampires
and say , &quot; oops . sorry ? &quot;
i can &apos;t believe you made a deal with her .
it was more like a helpful exchange of information .
and it was not exactly like i had a choice . she &apos;s ...
scary .
besides , she &apos;s gonna help me get katherine back .
of course she is .
damon gets what he wants , as usual .
no matter who he hurts in the process .
you don &apos;t have to be snarky about it .
i woke up this morning
to learn that all the vampires have been released from the tomb .
i &apos;ve earned snarky .
how long are you going to blame me
for turning your birth mother into a vampire ?
i &apos;m not blaming you , damon .
i &apos;ve accepted the fact that you &apos;re a self @-@ serving psychopath
with no redeeming qualities .
this isn &apos;t being very productive .
we &apos;re figure out a way to deal with pearl and the vampires . yeah ?
i &apos;m sorry . he just makes me so cranky .
i know . he makes everybody cranky .
so , what are we going to do ?
damon and i are gonna handle everything , i promise .
well , what about me ?
i can &apos;t just sit here and do nothing .
that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re gonna do ,
because that &apos;s what going to keep you safe .
which means nothing
if you &apos;re not safe , too .
what do you mean ? i &apos;m perfectly safe .
i have damon , the self @-@ serving psychopath on my side .
well , that &apos;s comforting .
ok . we have some time .
i &apos;m not meeting my mom until later .
wait . does your mom know you &apos;re a ...
the fact that you would even think it &apos;s possible
to keep something like that a secret from your own family
is just further proof that you &apos;re not ready .
&quot; not ready &quot; is a step up from &quot; no . &quot;
and a million steps down from &quot; maybe . &quot;
i like your bracelet .
thanks . my sister got it for me .
can i see it ?
yeah . yeah .
your sister doesn &apos;t know you &apos;re hanging out with me , does she ?
no . no . but i don &apos;t see why it would be a problem .
it &apos;s not like she knows what you are .
i &apos;d rather keep it our little secret .
you know , why don &apos;t you ... why don &apos;t you keep this ?
why would you give this to me ?
because . you like it . and i like you .
you only like me because of what you want from me .
no . i ... i like you .
you know , you should wear it .
it looks better on you anyway .
i yelled at my mom last night .
you know , i feel like the parent yelling at the screwed @-@ up kid .
maybe she needed to hear it .
yeah , but just ... i worry that if i push too hard ,
then she will take off again .
cause that &apos;s her m.o.
just like vicki ,
who i haven &apos;t heard from since she left .
well , you can &apos;t control your mom , matt ,
any more than you can control your sister .
i wish that she would just try a little . you know ?
if she would just try to try , that &apos;d be ok .
maybe she &apos;ll surprise you .
people have a tendency to do that .
i should go before the roads get even worse from the storm .
yeah . are you sure you should be driving right now ?
i have to . it &apos;s my dad &apos;s boyfriend &apos;s daughter &apos;s birthday .
we have a non @-@ traditional traditional ritual .
well , buckle up . don &apos;t speed .
stay off your cell phone .
and call me when you get there .
got it . anything else ?
yes .
bye .
bye .
hunting party ?
that guy did a number on me last night when he stabbed me .
i gotta get my strength back up .
i &apos;ve got 2 liters of soccer mom in the fridge .
no ?
we &apos;ll talk when i get back ?
all right . give my regards to the squirrels .
you &apos;re ignorinme me
the 6 missed calls ? sorry . my phone is dead .
is stefan here ?
no .
why ?
something wrong ?
he went out to the woods and didn &apos;t come back .
i can &apos;t get him on his phone .
i figured he was here with you .
it &apos;s going straight to voicemail .
where could he be ?
you &apos;re not going to like what i &apos;m thinking .
pearl ! open this door .
i swear to god i &apos;ll bust through and rip your head off .
pearl &apos;s not home .
hmm . beautiful weather .
not a ray of sun in the sky .
where &apos;s my brother ?
billy .
you &apos;re dead .
whoa . i &apos;m sorry .
you haven &apos;t been invited in .
miss gibbons ?
yes , frederick honey ?
never let this bad man in .
i &apos;ll never let him in .
145 years left starving in a tomb ,
thanks to katherine &apos;s infatuation with you and your brother .
first few weeks ,
every single nerve in your body screams with fire .
the kind of pain that can drive a person mad .
i thought your brother might &apos;ve wanted to get a taste of that
before i killed him . billy .
you have a nice day .
what happened ? where is he ?
they have him . i can &apos;t get in .
why not ?
because the woman that owns the house
is compelled to not let me in .
i can get in .
you &apos;re not going in there .
i &apos;m going !
you &apos;re not going there .
why are they doing this ? what do they want with him ?
revenge . they want revenge .
we gotta do something .
i know .
we can &apos;t let them hurt him . we gotta get him out of there .
i know . elena , i know .
but i don &apos;t know how to get him out .
vervain on the ropes .
that &apos;s gotta sting .
speaking of ...
this isn &apos;t right !
he killed bethanne .
one of us , harper .
and don &apos;t you think for a second
he wouldn &apos;t kill you if he had the chance .
pearl says we &apos;re not here for revenge , right ?
i say that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re here for .
starting with this .
and then his brother .
and anyone else that gets in our way .
this isn &apos;t right !
you &apos;re gonna want to let go of me !
miss pearl will be home soon .
miss pearl is no longer in charge .
tie him up ! and then stake him .
well , don &apos;t you look ... alive ?
you can &apos;t hurt me .
oh , i can hurt you , all right .
mr. saltzman .
we need your help .
stefan &apos;s in the house .
damon &apos;s a vampire . he can &apos;t get in . we need you .
i would go , but ...
your life is valuable .
yours , on the other hand ...
stefan told me about your ring .
what about it ?
let me recap ...
you tried to kill me . i defended myself .
you died .
then according to my brother ,
your ring brought you back to life .
am i leaving anything out ?
yeah . the part where i try and kill you again .
only this time , i don &apos;t miss .
mr. saltzman . please .
it &apos;s stefan .
i &apos;m sorry , elena . but it &apos;s not my problem .
that &apos;s a shame .
because the woman in charge of the crowd
can help you find your wife .
you &apos;re lying .
am i ?
why don &apos;t you ask her yourself ?
coward .
come on , elena .
all right ! wait .
i &apos;ll go .
so , i have an answer .
to what ?
why you should turn me .
we &apos;re back to that ?
look , i wake up every day , and i feel ok ,
but there &apos;s something missing .
like a ... like a hole .
some people , they fit ... in life , or whatever .
i ... i don &apos;t .
so , you want a pity @-@ turn ?
i don &apos;t think so .
you should turn me because i don &apos;t have anything else .
do you even know why we turn other people ?
it &apos;s not to give someone a one @-@ way ticket out of loner @-@ hood . ok ?
one--we need someone to do our dirty work .
two , revenge .
three , boredom ... but , you know , that never turns out well .
and then there &apos;s the obvious one .
you love someone so much that you would do anything
to spend all of eternity with them .
ahem . i &apos;m sorry , but you don &apos;t fit any of those categories yet .
so , yeah . just make sure your thesis is clear ,
and she &apos;ll love it .
see you later .
mom , hey .
did you get everything ?
the blood @-@ bank was understaffed because of the rain .
i was in and out .
who &apos;s that you were talking to ?
a friend from the library .
let &apos;s get home .
hey , you &apos;re not going out in that , are ya ?
the roads are dangerous . route 5 is completely flooded .
we &apos;ll make do .
mayor lockwood , we have your table ready .
great .
mayor ... lockwood , is it ?
i suppose it is treacherous outside .
my name is pearl .
this is my daughter anna .
we &apos;ve just recently moved to town .
welcome . richard lockwood .
this is my son tyler .
please ... please , join us .
it would be a pleasure .
be more creepy , dad .
not like your son is standing right here .
grow up . elections are coming .
she &apos;s a constituent . and a rich one , from the looks of it .
you can tell all that by looking at her ass ?
awesome . i &apos;m gonna go shoot some pool .
teacher by day , vampire hunter by night .
i &apos;ve you to thank for that .
what are these ?
those are tranquilizer darts filled with vervain .
just get me in . i &apos;ll get stefan out .
that &apos;s your plan ? you &apos;re just gonna take them all on yourself ?
well , i &apos;ll be a little stealthier than that , hopefully .
whoa . what are you doing ?
i &apos;m going with you guys .
no . no . no . no . no way .
you need me . i &apos;ll get in .
you could distract them , and then i &apos;ll get stefan out .
you &apos;ll get yourself killed . you &apos;re not going in there .
i &apos;m going .
so , when you get me in , get out as quickly as you can .
i know how to sneak around where they can &apos;t hear me .
you &apos;ll basically just be in the way .
damon , now is not the time to be the lone ranger .
fine . elena , you can drive the getaway car .
you &apos;re not going in the house .
you can &apos;t stop me . it &apos;s stefan we &apos;re talking about here .
you don &apos;t understand .
oh , i understand . i understand .
he &apos;s the reason you live .
his love lifts you up where you belong . i get it .
can you not joke around for 2 seconds ?
i can &apos;t protect you , elena .
i don &apos;t know how many vampires there are in there .
that &apos;s how long it takes you to get your head ripped off .
i have to be able to get in and get out .
i can &apos;t be distracted with your safety .
or this will end up a bloodbath that none of us walk away from
including stefan .
i know .
i get it .
i understand .
if we &apos;re gonna go , let &apos;s go .
where are you ? i can barely hear you .
i was supposed to go to my dad &apos;s , but route 5 closed down .
now i &apos;m detoured on some random backwoods path to hell .
well , you shouldn &apos;t be talking while you &apos;re driving .
i know , right ?
i need one of those bluetooth thingies .
look , you &apos;re breaking up .
just turn around and go back the same way you came .
and watch the road . ok ?
ok .
god .
oh , good , someone &apos;s home .
uh , could i use your phone ?
my--my car broke down a few miles up the road .
this was the first house i saw .
well , lucky you .
yeah . lucky me .
it &apos;s no trouble , is it ?
not the slightest .
great . whew .
hey , man , i really appreciate it .
it &apos;s rough out there .
billy , show our visitor where the phone is in the kitchen .
and get me something to drink .
yeah . sure thing .
hey , miss gibbons , this guy wants to use your phone .
oh , sure , honey . it &apos;s right there .
thanks .
what &apos;s happening ?
i &apos;m really sorry . but you &apos;re gonna need to invite
a friend of mine inside .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . he &apos;s not allowed in the house .
i know that . but you gotta make an exception .
get her out of the house . now !
miss gibbons , tell me the truth .
are you married ?
no .
parents , children , anyone else who lives on this property ?
no . it &apos;s just me .
no ? good .
you were supposed to compel her .
it doesn &apos;t work that ...
she was human .
and i &apos;m not ! so , i don &apos;t care .
now , get out of here . get rid of the body !
i &apos;m in the process of obtaining some property .
i understand that your family
is the largest property owner in town .
well , yes we are .
dating all the way back to the town &apos;s original charter .
your family came into a lot of new property in 1864 .
you know your history .
it &apos;s a passion of mine .
guy &apos;s not even subtle about it .
who is that ?
it &apos;s not my mother .
i &apos;m sorry , mayor .
do you know that boy over there ?
that &apos;s jeremy gilbert .
you don &apos;t say .
billy , what &apos;s the holdup ? !
damn it , elena !
billy , jacob , get back in here !
are you insane ?
jeremy gilbert ?
is that what you &apos;ve been up to ?
he &apos;s my friend . what &apos;s the big deal ?
his family is the reason
i was stuck in a tomb for over a century .
that doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;ll make the same choices .
i want you to stop seeing him .
i &apos;ve been on my own for a long time , mother .
i can make my own decisions .
then stop acting like a child !
as soon as jeremy finds
out what you really are , he will turn on you .
he already knows .
what did you just say ?
jeremy knows .
he likes it . and he likes me .
thank you .
for trying to help me .
they just needed somebody to blame ,
someone to punish .
elena ...
you shouldn &apos;t be here ...
she was supposed to stay in the car .
unh ! no . no . no . not him .
whatever . let &apos;s get you down .
there &apos;s vervain on the ropes .
elena , pull that .
all right , let &apos;s go . clothes on .
wait .

well , sit down . you might wanna order pizza .
i &apos;m out of practice .
mmm . mystery casserole . yum .
yeah . some people aren &apos;t meant for the kitchen .
what ?
uh , i know it &apos;s been rough .
but i &apos;m gonna try .

it was a lie , wasn &apos;t it ?
yep .
stop !
what &apos;s going on here ?
what did you do ?
me ?
your merry little band of vampires
spent the day torturing my brother .
trust me . the parties responsible for this will be dealt with .
our little arrangement
doesn &apos;t work unless you learn to contrl them
this wasn &apos;t supposed to happen .
well , it did .
if i had a good side ...
not a way to get on it .
stefan !
how are you doing ?
i &apos;m ok .
the wounds have mostly healed .
good .
elena ...
yeah ?
what you did today ,
coming to help me ...
you could have been killed .
i know .
and what i did , i &apos;m sorry that ...
i &apos;m sorry that you had to see it .
i &apos;ve just never ...
you were like this other person .
and it &apos;s my fault . i made you ...
no . no . no . no .
you didn &apos;t make me do anything .
you were saving my life .
and i was saving yours .
everything &apos;s gonna be ok .
hey , jer ...
what ... what &apos;s going on ?
oh , no .
i made you some coffee .
thanks .
are you ...

i just , uh ...
i need to be alone right now .

she &apos;s the reason you wanted to turn .
you wanted to be with her .
