criminal minds s07e01
when do i leave ?
the end of the week .
they can &apos;t just take you away .
it &apos;s done .
you want me to raise your son
so he can have your life ?
he needs a mother .
i can &apos;t do this .
go to your father .
that corner right there , that &apos;s where he died ,
and that &apos;s where i &apos;m gonna kill you .
there &apos;s something you don &apos;t know
about those photos .
god , so they took pictures of them being shot ?
look at the fingernails .
oh , my god .
just because i held a gun to him
doesn &apos;t mean i shot him .
i staged his death .
he &apos;s alive ? !
no , no , no . no , emily .
stay with me . come on , stay with me .
where &apos;s the medic ? !
she never made it off the table .
i didn &apos;t get a chance to say good @-@ bye .
yeah , sometimes i feel like i want to quit my job
and spend my time chasing
down the son of a bitch who killed emily .
you &apos;re damn right i &apos;m angry .
the bureau is facing a lot of changes .
over the next few weeks each of you is going to be asked
if you &apos;d like to stay with the unit .
why wouldn &apos;t we ?
there are other options for you out there .
you &apos;ve given some thought to what we discussed ?
i &apos;m coming back .
and how long have you been back with the bureau ?
3.1 / 2 months , sir .
a lot has happened since then .
sabbaticals , transfers , reassignments .
four of you remained in the unit ?
agents rossi , morgan , and i were there
with our technical analyst penelope garcia .
hmm . you had 14 cases in that time .
17 , sir .
oh , yes . in 14 weeks .
that &apos;s impressive .
thank you .
but what &apos;s more impressive
is the fact that you were reinstated , promoted ,
and suspended in that short time .
i believe that &apos;s a record , agent jareau .
why aren &apos;t we in there ?
they &apos;re just trying to intimidate us .
well , that &apos;s not about to happen .
i &apos;m not ok with this .
you may not even be a witness .
sir , i &apos;m not worried about me .
don &apos;t they have anything better to do than--
baby girl , this is just what they do .
anything ?
it doesn &apos;t look good .
how long is she gonna be in there ?
two days ?
that &apos;s correct .
how can an investigation be active
for just two days when the gathering of intel took months ?
there &apos;s surveillance and hundreds of man @-@ hours to prove it .
yes , that &apos;s true , but--
how often do you spend months on a case , agent ?
we don &apos;t , but this one was--
personal ?
different .
it required a lot of detail .
if this was too big for your team ,
why wasn &apos;t it a joint taskforce ?
we didn &apos;t have time , sir .
once the subject was confirmed ,
we had to act quickly .
i &apos;ve got the shot , agent .
don &apos;t take the shot ! don &apos;t shoot !
i got him !
want to kill me yourself , agent ?
do you realize what you &apos;ve done ?
yes . we put an international criminal
with terrorist connections in federal custody .
you may consider that a victory ,
but you used government funds for a personal vendetta ,
never called homeland security ,
and now 6 people , including two of your agents ,
are dead .
queen elizabeth i said ,
&quot; the past cannot be cured . &quot;
interpol , europol , the cia .
no one could locate ian doyle ,
except agent morgan .
well , it wasn &apos;t easy .
doyle disappeared underground .
it looks like agent morgan spent the first few months
following doyle &apos;s arms @-@ dealing contacts but came up empty .
so , how did he find him ?
after hitting dead ends in that world ,
agent morgan put himself in doyle &apos;s shoes
and knew that he would be looking for his son , declan .
ok , emily needed to get declan a new identity .
so she must have used someone she trusted .
all right , well , that &apos;s a short list ,
but it &apos;s probably not even written down .
even if it was , she &apos;s had contacts all over the world .
oh , tell me about it . two columns--
domestic and imports .
you guys seen spence ?
he &apos;s at the firing range .
again ?
ever since prentiss died , he ...
right .
did you guys just get a new case ?
it &apos;s just an old one .
do you want some fresh eyes ?
not just yet .
ok .
um , well , let me know .
shouldn &apos;t we tell her ?
garcia , this has been a long shot for 6 months .
why get her hopes up ?
what about hotch ?
he knows i &apos;m doing this .
he does ?
not technically ,
but he knows i &apos;m not about to let doyle roam free .
does he know we &apos;re looking for declan ?
i just figured i &apos;d call him when i have something to report .
ok .
but it feels weird not sharing .
baby girl .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
i know .
did you trust agent jareau ?
i did .
but don &apos;t anymore .
i didn &apos;t say that .
you left her out but involved penelope garcia ,
whom you trust .
that is not why .
isn &apos;t it ?
her specific skills were very helpful .
for your vendetta .
for justice .
you don &apos;t believe in the system .
ian doyle wasn &apos;t at the top of
anyone &apos;s list , senator .
except yours .
i &apos;m thinking domestic contacts .
em was already in the states
when she faked declan &apos;s death , so ...
her associates must be in boston ?
no , garcia , she would have covered her tracks better than that .
all right , why did prentiss join the bau ?
to have a normal life .
she could have gone anywhere with her skill set ,
but she chose d.c.
maybe to be close to her mom ?
no . no way . that was just by default .
garcia , she did all of this to protect a child .
right . so you &apos;re saying she came here
just so she could be close to the kid .
and if she did , she probably had people
she could trust living right here .
right . so domestic contacts .
there are surprising few in our nation &apos;s capital .
one of which is dead . ben corelli .
he was a forger .
doyle killed him and prentiss &apos; friend .
he worked out of his apartment , remember ?
yeah . and we processed his belongings .
thanks .
this would have been a heck of a lot easier
had he gone digital .
garcia , there &apos;s an art to all of this .
this guy was meticulous .
definite control freak .
yet he &apos;s dead . he couldn &apos;t control that .
there can &apos;t be a lot of ids for children .
actually , you would be surprised .
ok , wait a minute .
didn &apos;t prentiss live in reston , virginia , for a while ?
yeah . before we knew her ,
she rented a big house in a cul @-@ de @-@ sac .
ok , why would she live way out there ?
to be close to declan .
who had blond hair and blue eyes .
well , i &apos;m sure they &apos;ve changed his hair color by now .
yeah , but you can &apos;t change those cerulean blues .
ok , here &apos;s the nanny .
garcia , she still lives in virginia .
here &apos;s all i got . declan &apos;s going to a boarding school
in stafford county . his nanny lives 5 minutes from campus .
all signs point to a really well @-@ adjusted kid .
he &apos;s an honor student . he &apos;s playing lacrosse .
he &apos;s winning science fairs . it looks like he &apos;s got the life
emily wanted him to have .
you watched declan for two months .
i knew if i could find him ,
it was only a matter of time before doyle did .
around @-@ the @-@ clock surveillance requires constant presence .
when i wasn &apos;t in the field , i was there .
and when you were on a case ?
i set up pole cameras for surveillance .
under what authority , agent ?
senator , i needed to protect this child
because i knew doyle would find him eventually .
and what was the plan once you found ian doyle ?
lock down security on his son
and then move in on doyle .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
it &apos;s him . i &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s him .
it &apos;s blurry and , you know , he &apos;s not like posing for the camera
or anything like that , but you said he &apos;d come
and it &apos;s been a while and now he &apos;s here and--
garcia , garcia , calm down . let me take a look .
that &apos;s when agent morgan initiated the assault on ian doyle .
what ? no , it doesn &apos;t work that way , sir .
agent morgan called hotch--
excuse me , our unit chief .
who was on temporary duty .
i imagine he wasn &apos;t easy to find .
when the team downsized ,
he was assigned to lead an investigative taskforce .
hotchner .
hey , it &apos;s me .
how &apos;s it going out there ?
you know , long days ,
some territorial issues to work out .
nothing surprising . how &apos;s everything there ?
hotch , we found declan doyle .
what ?
listen , i knew that finding the kid
was the only way i could find doyle , hotch .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , man .
is declan safe ?
yeah , he is for now .
i &apos;ve had surveillance at his house and his school
for a few weeks .
morgan , i didn &apos;t authorize this .
i know you didn &apos;t , hotch , but listen to me .
i think doyle may have found declan , too .
all right , i &apos;m coming back .
you want me to wait ?
morgan , it could be a trap .
you make sure you have eyes on doyle .
and if it is him ?
then you take the shot .
you got any movement ?
negative . no movement detected .
that &apos;s all hotch said ?
take the shot ?
yeah , but he &apos;s pissed .
hey , spence .
i can &apos;t find him .
what do you mean , you can &apos;t find him ?
the headmistress said declan got sick and went home .
ok , uh , call for backup and get to the house .
we &apos;re already here .
you see the agents ?
their car &apos;s out front .
the lights are off .
i &apos;ll call you back .
what--reid !
i &apos;ll check the back . you take the hallway .
must be the nanny .
3 bodies and no kid .
doyle &apos;s got him .
the squad car that went by got doyle &apos;s attention .
you see that ? i &apos;ve got movement .
he &apos;s in there .
we had to move quickly .
agent hotchner said if we have the shot ...
take it .
he &apos;s going to the roof .
jj , cover the back stairs .
spence . what do you mean , he &apos;s gone ?
i &apos;ve got the shot , agent .
don &apos;t take the shot ! don &apos;t shoot ! i got him !
want to kill me yourself , agent ?
why didn &apos;t you let him take the shot , agent ?
because a bullet to ian doyle &apos;s brain
would have ended his life too easily ?
you wanted him to suffer .
he deserved the same beating he gave prentiss ,
but i did not unleash that on him , senator .
no , you didn &apos;t .
instead , your actions put an innocent child &apos;s life on the line .
have you ever been in the field ?
i have .
but i &apos;m not the one on trial , agent .
then maybe you can imagine
what it was like for agent morgan
to find emily prentiss dying ...
at the hands of ian doyle .
now ask yourself ...
was it wrong for him to want
to take that man out ?
forgotten where i &apos;ve been , agent ?
places far worse than this .
doyle , where &apos;s declan ?
don &apos;t play dumb .
you found him a month before i did .
he &apos;s living in that lovely little house
our friend set up for him .
i should have found him sooner .
finally remembered she likes cul @-@ de @-@ sacs .
where is declan right now ?
you expect me to believe
you had nothing to do with his abduction ?
and you expect me to believe this isn &apos;t part of the strategy ?
you tell me my son is missing
when i know he was safe a few hours ago ?
you &apos;ll have to get more creative .
listen to me , you son of a bitch .
i am not playing games with you .
if you care about anybody other than yourself ,
you &apos;ll give me a list of who would have done this .
why would anyone take declan ?
you tell me .
no one even knows he exists .
someone does .
because when we followed you to that little rat trap ,
somebody took him from his house .
somebody else was watching you , doyle . now tell me who .
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t .
your son is missing .
so think .
i don &apos;t know .
how long has agent morgan been looking for doyle ?
the night he killed prentiss in boston .
he refused to believe doyle just vanished .
he &apos;s been investigating doyle for 7 months ?
why , are you surprised ?
he seems genuine .
well , of course he does .
he &apos;s a master manipulator .
see his carotid ?
his heart started racing when morgan told him about declan .
the tightness in his forehead ,
his darting eyes , are signs of real concern .
well , if he didn &apos;t take his son , then who did ?
damn it .
rossi , it &apos;s me . i just see one ninja @-@ like guy .
you sure ?
and just clipped the camera . i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t worry , garcia . you were busy looking for doyle .
she didn &apos;t see a team on the footage .
this was well @-@ organized . one could have cut the camera
while the other started in here .
so they cut off the power ,
but no signs of forced entry .
so how do you overpower two armed agents ?
a male and a female .
maybe whoever did this posed as the next shift ?
makes sense . everything about them seems efficient .
except they took the time to shove her in the closet .
so it &apos;s personal and professional .
only declan and the caregiver live here ,
so whose stuff is this ?
40 long .
you still think doyle &apos;s behind this ?
he &apos;s capable of a lot of things ,
but being two places at once isn &apos;t one of them .
doyle , i &apos;m gonna ask you one last time ...
who hates you enough to take him ?
how long has it been ?
6 hours .
you &apos;ve had your time to find him .
now let me have mine .
that &apos;s not about to happen .
he didn &apos;t do it .
no .
what the hell is going on here ?
what ?
nothing .
has aaron landed ?
he &apos;s on his way .
good .
welcome back , sir .
thank you . what have you got ?
got a top @-@ 10 list of doyle &apos;s enemies .
anybody recently in the states ?
richard gerace &apos;s been here a few weeks .
he &apos;s a low @-@ level gun @-@ runner who angrily crossed paths with doyle .
i caught an image of him
on the surveillance camera at declan &apos;s house ,
confirmed it was him through a scar on his neck .
all right . get me everything you can on gerace .
yeah . what i just told you is everything i &apos;ve got .
well , that &apos;s a good look .
how was the desert ?
hot .
you seen jack yet ?
no . jessica took him to hershey park for the weekend .
well , he &apos;ll love that beard .
yeah , we skyped every day .
he &apos;s not a fan .
doyle , do you consider richard gerace an enemy ?
i don &apos;t consider him at all .
tell me about him .
gave him a nasty scar in belfast 20 years ago .
hasn &apos;t been my problem since .
whose problem was he ?
she won &apos;t help .
why not ?
because i killed her .
he was referring to agent prentiss ?
that &apos;s correct , sir .
the government spent 17,400 on her funeral
and another 642,000 on medical expenses .
but this is no surprise to you .
hey . got your message .
it &apos;s time .
why ? morgan may be able to break doyle without her .
declan tried to make a call . she &apos;s on the way .
all right . i &apos;ll get morgan .
i &apos;ll tell the others .
you get anywhere with doyle ?
doyle doesn &apos;t think gerace has the guts to take him on .
but that &apos;s definitely gerace on the tape .
welcome back .
thanks . everybody have a seat .
why ?
what &apos;s going on ? everything all right ?
7 months ago i made a decision that affected this team .
as you all know , emily had
lost a lot of blood after her fight with doyle .
but the doctors were able to stabilize her .
and she was airlifted from
boston to bethesda under a covert exfiltration .
her identity was strictly need @-@ to @-@ know .
and she stayed there until she was well enough to travel .
she was reassigned to paris
where she was given several identities ,
none of which we had access to for her security .
she &apos;s alive ?
but we buried her .
as i said , i take full responsibility for the decision .
if anyone has any issues , they should be directed toward me .
any issues ?
yeah , i got issues .
oh , my god .
at least you &apos;ve got her back .
did we ?
i am so sorry .
i really am .
not a day went by that i didn &apos;t want to ...
really , i--
you didn &apos;t deserve that .
and i &apos;m so sorry .
there &apos;s so much i want to tell you guys ,
and i will . i promise . but right now
i really need to know what &apos;s going on with declan .
emily , was there a man living at the house ?
yes . my friend tom koehler .
he was raising declan as his own .
where is he ?
i never saw him
go in or out of that house .
he was on assignment overseas .
but he &apos;s all right ?
yes . he &apos;s on his way back now .
he got a call from declan , he called me ,
and when i landed , hotch told me that you had doyle in custody .
and because of tom &apos;s line of work ,
that &apos;s why you enrolled declan in a boarding school .
i made sure that he , louise , and i were the only ones
allowed to take him off campus .
louise took him home last night because he was sick .
food poisoning .
yeah , a few of the kids had it , apparently .
so whoever did this got to him on campus .
they knew they only had one chance .
current suspect is richard gerace .
he &apos;s the most recent arrival into the states .
we &apos;ve been tracking his
progress through the city , but we came up empty .
but we know it &apos;s him because he has the scar .
that doesn &apos;t make sense . gerace gave up on doyle a long time ago .
he said you were the only one who knew gerace .
which is why i &apos;m pretty sure he doesn &apos;t have the balls
to pull this off .
there was no forced entry at the house ?
i had two agents working security .
we think gerace and his partner
posed as the next shift ,
and one of the agents was a woman .
she &apos;s the alpha .
so we &apos;re looking for a woman who &apos;s getting back at doyle .
and our suspect list just got a whole lot longer .
doyle had relations with all of these ladies ?
most .
hey , can you shoot these
into the roundtable room for me ?
anything you say , visitor prentiss .
thanks .
so you &apos;re actually back .
they &apos;ve been looking for your replacement ,
and rossi called me .
that &apos;s great .
how &apos;s will with the long hours again ?
long story .
i haven &apos;t seen ashley .
oh , well , she transferred to andi swann &apos;s unit .
good for her .
so , how , uh , angry is the team ?
they &apos;re in shock .
of course .
thank you .
it is really good to see you .
these women are associates of doyle &apos;s
who may have crossed paths with gerace .
anyone have a deeper personal connection with doyle ?
whoever took declan showed a lot of rage at the nanny .
she had been with doyle since before declan was born .
the nanny represents a caregiver , a mother figure .
who is declan &apos;s mother ?
doyle told me she was dead .
of course .
which one is declan &apos;s mom ?
chloe donaghy . but she had nothing to do with this .
how do you know ?
did you kill her , too ?
because she tried to kill declan before he was ever born .
do you know who i am ?
no .
i &apos;m your mum .
she brought tainted cupcakes to the boarding school
and just walked right in .
oh , that is creepy .
we thought doyle was bad . check her out .
yeah , she ran an international prostitution ring
before moving on to chemicals .
distribution and trafficking ,
manufacturing , possession , weapons charges ?
went away for 3 years .
that &apos;s it ?
she hardly seems like the mothering type .
why would she take declan ?
it isn &apos;t love .
who were her contacts in the states ?
whoever they are , they &apos;re as good as dead .
she works her people , sucks &apos; em dry , and then ...
moves on .
she never wanted declan . why would she take him ?
this is about you , ian .
you just told me you kept her a prisoner for 9 months .
7 .
7 .
did louise help deliver declan ?
yes .
that &apos;s called revenge , ian .
chloe didn &apos;t just forget about what you put her through .
she would rather have been dead than to have my baby .
what as i supposed to do ?
chaining her to a bed wasn &apos;t the answer .
she received a lot of money for her troubles .
that was torture , ian .
and you don &apos;t think she spent years
figuring out how to do the same to you ?
she took the only thing you love .
what else would she and gerace have to gain from taking declan ?
money .
that &apos;s all she ever cared about .
i need a list of everyone
with the kind of money they &apos;re looking for ,
and anyone else who wants to hurt you .
forgetting the international ties for a minute ,
what would these unsubs do ?
you know , statistically the abduction
of a child by its mother , no matter the psychological
disposition of said mother , would be one of low risk to child .
she &apos;s got plenty of connections . she could go underground .
is there anywhere in the u.s.
where chloe and doyle had a history ?
no . but they do have a lot of ties in europe .
doyle came up with associates of chloe &apos;s
who have healthy bank accounts .
he thinks it &apos;s a trade ? for what , weapons ? drugs ?
garcia , run these names .
see if any have local connections .
yeah . what else should i be looking for , you guys ?
secluded properties .
a legitimate business that requires international
bank accounts and trade .
it could be mundane . they survive under the radar .
garcia , start with irish backgrounds .
this type of feud could go back generations .
it looks like the doyles and the mcdermotts have a thing .
what kind of thing ?
ian doyle murdered jimmy mcdermott ,
but his younger brother lachlan
owns an import company .
do they ship internationally ?
you know it . he has 3 warehouses ,
once of which is slated to be demolished .
where ?
inner harbor , baltimore .
let &apos;s go .
i trust you called the baltimore city police .
no , sir .
certainly the harbor police .
no , sir .
why didn &apos;t you ?
the last i checked , it takes and hour
to drive from headquarters to baltimore .
and i see your phones were working .
he &apos;s gone .
over here !
doyle said chloe would clean house .
so what the hell is she doing now ?
she &apos;s getting out of the country .
gerace was dead weight .
she thinks she &apos;s gonna get more for the kid without him .
yeah .
declan &apos;s disappeared .
they had him at the warehouse , but now they &apos;re gone .
your ex is working with lachlan mcdermott .
how would he leave the country ?
i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s got endless funds . you &apos;ll never stop him .
he hates you , doesn &apos;t he ?
more than you do .
then i think we should give him what he really wants .
you .
you &apos;re the one who suggested ian doyle be released .
i am .
and you &apos;re the only agent who has not requested
reinstatement to the unit .
was the decision to release ian doyle a personal one ?
a young boy &apos;s life was at stake .
i ran the probability of his survival and it wasn &apos;t good .
if you want to punish me for taking a risk ,
then i encourage you to do that ,
but do not put the rest of my team on trial
for something that i suggested .
calm down , agent .
this is calm , and it &apos;s doctor .
no , we are not letting him out of here , reid .
emily , i will chain myself to him if i have to .
he &apos;ll find a way to escape .
no , he won &apos;t , and we &apos;re running out of time .
if we find mcdermott now , we have a chance to save declan .
the united states government
is not in the business of trading captives .
new york city , july 2010,
referred to as the spy swap . igor--
that &apos;s enough .
you can &apos;t just change the rules , sir .
and you just can &apos;t break them .
is strauss still there ?
she is .
we need full support .
doyle said mcdermott &apos;s family imported weapons
to a private airfield in maryland .
close ?
largo .
all right , send me the coordinates .
i fully understand that , ma &apos;am ,
but i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s only a matter of minutes
before they leave the country with him .
but what makes you think
they won &apos;t take off with doyle and his son ?
we won &apos;t let that happen .
you can &apos;t guarantee that .
i am certain that without this move ,
there is a very good chance
that little boy is going to die .
the team &apos;s already on their way , aren &apos;t they ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
down there .
he looks just like his father .
it makes me sick .
so what are you gonna do with him ?
i didn &apos;t think you cared .
i don &apos;t .
you were supposed to get me doyle .
what can i say ? the feds beat me to it .
he &apos;ll have to do . as long as the kid &apos;s alive ,
doyle will find a way to get to him .
unless he gets killed in custody .
you played gerace . you &apos;re not gonna play me , too .
i don &apos;t know what this is .
lachlan mcdermott and chloe donaghy , this is fbi .
you called the feds ?
why would i do that ?
we know you have declan .
to ensure his safety we would like to trade .
we will give you ian doyle
and you send us the boy .
this--this was not our deal .
not , but it just got interesting .
you &apos;re not leaving .
get over there , boy .
bring doyle here !
i want him here on his knees !
hotch , are we really gonna do this ?
no one leaves here .
you bastard .
how &apos;s it feeling ?
it &apos;s your bloody time now , isn &apos;t it ?
now hand him over .
gun !
i remember you .
sorry , son .
this team took many unprecedented risks .
none were approved .
the diog has rules ,
and you chose to ignore every last one .
that &apos;s blatant disrespect to the bureau
and to authority of law in general .
what i find interesting
is that you are the experts in behavior
but find nothing wrong with yours .
may i ?
the journey was not traditional ,
but this team neutralized 4 international criminals
and saved the life of a young boy in the process .
you started a war with ian doyle years ago
that this team and the u.s. government had to finish .
the rest of you are dismissed .
agent prentiss , we &apos;re not done .
i never thought we &apos;d be taking one of these down .
i already tried . it &apos;s screwed in .
you &apos;re kidding me .
i got this .
perfect .
i also have sergio .
oh , i knew you would .
i need visitation rights .
he &apos;s a love , isn &apos;t he ?
yeah , he &apos;s takes after his mom .
morgan .
i know what you &apos;ve been through .
i understand that you &apos;re angry ,
but i hope that you understand
that this is not about you ... or me .
this was about saving emily .
we need to talk .
the committee made it clear
they will not support a rogue team .
agent prentiss convinced them you were not that .
they will be watching you closely .
so i suggest you play by their rules .
so we &apos;re ok ?
suspension is lifted for everyone .
thank you , ma &apos;am .
there may be more paperwork , considering your ...
situation ,
but the team is lucky to have you ,
if you &apos;re interested .
may i think about it ?
of course .
i &apos;m in .
i have a stack of cases on my desk .
i &apos;m happy to pass them all off to you .
i &apos;ll pick them up in the morning .
emily , uh ...
what did you tell them ?
the only people i know who could accomplish that mission
just walked out .
they do their jobs with integrity ,
and most importantly , they honor their oath .
&quot; i will support and defend
&quot; the constitution of the united states of america
&quot; against all enemies ,
&quot; foreign and domestic .
&quot; i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same ,
&quot; that i take this obligation freely ,
&quot; without any mental reservation
&quot; or purpose of evasion .
&quot; that i will well and faithfully
&quot; discharge the duties of the office
&quot; on which i am about to enter ,
