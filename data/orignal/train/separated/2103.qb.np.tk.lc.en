this is not a hike , steven .
your dad used to bring you up here when you were a kid ?
every year .
yeah , well , that will explain a lot .
you can bring grace up here when she gets a bit older .
grace wants to go get a manicure and a pedicure , okay ?
she &apos;s not interested in
going to look at old graffiti on rocks , okay ?
this is basically child abuse .
they &apos;re called &quot; petroglyphs , &quot; danny .
they &apos;re called &quot; petroglyphs . &quot;
that is a fancy name for graffiti etched in rocks , okay ?
you know what ? i remember the first time
i beat my father to the summit .
i remember like it was yesterday .
all due respect , what &apos;s wrong with
an old @-@ fashioned baseball game , steve , huh ?
i &apos;ve never been to a professional baseball game .
that doesn &apos;t surprise me at all .
i mean , how could ... ? forget about it .
you know what ? to each his own .
we had the yankees ; you and your old man had a ...
i don &apos;t know what .
deep @-@ sea demolition classes or something .
stop talking for a second .
look at this view .
this view , this has not changed one bit since i was a kid .
everything else has changed ,
but not this .
you know what ? i , um ,
i found another one of those envelopes
on my doorstep yesterday morning .
it had an old matchbook in it .
used to be in my father &apos;s toolbox .
you think it &apos;s from wo fat ?
i don &apos;t know .
what does kaye think ?
kaye thinks wo fat &apos;s playing a game with me .
i don &apos;t understand . what kind of game , huh ?
like he &apos;s trying to get you to believe
that your father was a dirty cop or something .
let me tell you something . my father was such a good man
and he was a great cop ,
and whatever case he was working on before he was killed ,
i &apos;m gonna find out what that was .
it still doesn &apos;t explain why someone &apos;s
sending that case evidence back to you .
maybe someone &apos;s trying to lead me to wo fat .
maybe wo fat &apos;s trying lure you .
come on .
all right .
this is it .
the ancient hawaiians called this
&quot; k &apos;i&apos;i pohaku . &quot; it means &quot; images in the stone . &quot;
this one right here , this is honu .
it &apos;s a turtle .
yeah , that &apos;s a turtle .
what about this guy right here ? what &apos;s this ?
these are symbols of the hunt .
it &apos;s pretty cool , huh ?
better than a yankee &apos;s game ?
it &apos;s not even close to as good as a yankee &apos;s game ,
but it &apos;s nice .
danny , danny , there &apos;s someone down there !
i &apos;m going down there .
he could still be alive .
is he all right ?
he &apos;s dead !
he &apos;s got a gunshot wound through and though .
there &apos;s very little blood .
all right , look , there &apos;s no action up here .
no signs of struggle . somebody dumped him .
it &apos;s gotta be from a plane or helicopter .
step back . let me take a picture .
all right , come on . let &apos;s go .
we &apos;ll go for a little hike ,
call the crime scene unit . come on .
i need you to take up the slack as i climb , all right ?
all right , take that slack , danny .
go easy .
take your time .

steve !
steve ! steve !
steve ! hey , steve !
steve !
hey , steve , don &apos;t move , all right ? !

i &apos;m good . i &apos;m good .
danny , i think my arm &apos;s broken .
can you send that rope down ?
it &apos;s snagged on a branch .
all right , look , i &apos;m gonna call for help .
no , there &apos;s no cell service here .
but there is at the summit .
you need to climb up
and call in a medevac team , all right ?
all right , don &apos;t move , all right ?
hey , danny , throw my pack down before you go .
all right , i got it , i got it .
hey , listen to me . do not move .
be careful up there . it &apos;s really steep .
all right .
uh , gunshot wound , small- caliber , through @-@ and @-@ through .
wait .
there &apos;s fish scales in the exit wound .
how long ?
i can &apos;t promise , but i &apos;ll try .
hey , gonna order some loko moko from ono lau @-@ lau .
you in ?
it &apos;s auntie mele .
they called the hospice .
her kidney &apos;s shutting down .
she &apos;s asking to see everyone tonight .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s a good idea for me to go by there now .
look , if you &apos;re worried what uncle keako will think , don &apos;t .
he &apos;s the one who called .
he did ?
he made me promise to bring you by the house tonight .
you forget he &apos;s a cop .
he knows you &apos;ve been coming by to see her when he &apos;s not there .
hey , i thought you were supposed to be on a hike with mcgarrett .
steve fell . he &apos;s hurt .
whoa . what ? how bad ?
i don &apos;t know how bad . i &apos;m not a doctor .
but i think he broke his arm .
where are you ?
you know what ? forget it .
triangulating your coordinates off the cell phone signal .
all right , listen , we need a rescue team
as soon as possible .
i &apos;ll contact army evac . stand by .
let me use your phone .
okay .
all right , i &apos;ve got your location .
okay , listen , we need a crime scene unit , too ,
as soon as possible .
we found a body .
whoa , wait .
i thought you said this is a rescue mission .
what &apos;s a body doing way up there ?
i don &apos;t know what a body &apos;s doing way up here .
the guy doesn &apos;t look like a hiker ,
mid @-@ 50s , work clothes .
i &apos;m gonna send you a picture . hold on .
all right , i got him . i &apos;ll run it through the system
and see if i can get an i.d.
evac choppers on it &apos;s way .
all right , i &apos;m heading back .
hey , did you get reception ?
yeah . army evac &apos;s on its way .
i don &apos;t think we have time , all right ?
these clouds , they look bad .
if it starts raining ,
this place is gonna turn into a big mudslide .
all right ,
i &apos;m gonna come down untangle the rope ,
and i &apos;m gonna bring it to you , all right ?
hey , take it easy , all right ?
hey , easy , easy . hey !
i &apos;m not gonna catch your ass if you fall .
i &apos;d rather you not catch me if i fall , okay ?
got it .
all right .
need another doughnut .
army evac &apos;s here .
this is rescue chopper one .
commander mcgarrett . we &apos;re gonna get you out of here , sir .
hey , danny .
thanks , brother .
hey , how &apos;s steve ?
he shattered his forearm
and picked up some nasty gashes from the fall .
steve is fine .
that was a hell of a place to find a body .
yeah . that far out , whoever dumped it there
probably never wanted it to be found .
probably figured the wild boars would vanish it .
okay . we got an id on our vic ?
yeah . his name is jack leung .
53 years old . he has a fishing boat license
in his name that he works with his son sean .
fishing boat . okay .
that would explain this .
what is that ?
this is fish scales that steve found around the gunshot wound .
all right , well , if they were found around the gunshot wound ,
maybe they were transferred pre @-@ body dump .
from his boat ?
okay , i know this sounds ridiculous ,
but if we can identify these scales , then we get close
to our primary crime scene .
friend of mine &apos;s an ichthyologist
at the university . maybe he can identify them .
okay , uh ...
this guy &apos;s in our system .
what was he arrested for ?
all right , so according to his record ,
jack leung was a law @-@ abiding citizen until
three days ago , when he was charged
for assaulting another fishing boat captain ,
down at the docks .
booking sheet lists
a slip down in honolulu harbor .
leung &apos;s fight club partner ,
sal groves . leung assaulted him
with a gaffing pole . and get this :
he &apos;s a licensed helicopter pilot .
he could &apos;ve used it to dispose of the body .
oh , okay . let &apos;s go talk to sal ,
see if he knows why leung ended up in the jungle .
okay ?
so sal &apos;s boat should be right down there .
all right , kono , i want you to leung &apos;s son sean .
we &apos;ll go deal with sal , all right ?
all right , so we just went through the loop .
now , this is the tricky part .
we &apos;re going to go around it five times , okay ?
just like that .
officer kono kalakaua .
are you sean leung ?
yes .
hey , brian .
i want you to go down in the hold
and do this ten more times . okay ?
okay . go below . good boy .
i take it you &apos;re not here to check for my permits .
i &apos;m afraid not .
i &apos;m sorry to inform you that ...
your father
was found dead this morning .
how ?
he was shot .
his body was recovered in the mountains north of here .
oh , my god .
why would someone do this ?
we don &apos;t know .
when was the last time you saw him ?
yesterday .
he took the boat out for a short run ,
and got in some nice fish that i took to market .
did you notice anything that was out of the ordinary ?
yeah .
i found my laptop on .
uh ... the only reason i noticed
is &apos; cause i check the weather first thing .
my pops was old school .
no cell phone , no computers .
the only surfing he did was on a long board .
what can you tell me about the altercation
your father had a couple days ago with sal groves ?
he wouldn &apos;t tell me .
my father didn &apos;t want me to get involved .
said he was taking care of it .
there &apos;s our boy .
sal groves , five @-@ o !
cut your engines !
he &apos;s running . come on !
hands up , ahab .
do it !
now !
all right .
thank you .
so why don &apos;t you save us a little time
and tell us why you decided to go for a little jog .
&apos;cause i love cops so much .
you know , i @-@ i @-@ i told him , when i was thinking this .
i know why you were running .
so why don &apos;t you just sit here
and ponder your love for law enforcement ,
while he goes and searches your boat .
you can &apos;t search the boat without a warrant .
really ? what are you ... watch .
hey ! you can &apos;t do that !
what are you doing ?
just shut up and pay attention to this , okay ?
what &apos;s that got to do with anything ?
this has got to do with a lot .
see , &apos; cause we found this guy dead this morning , okay ?
when we ran him through the system ,
your name came up .
what , you guys had a little beef ?
guy attacked me .
ah oh ! got something , danny .
we got a fresh catch .
a fresh catch of crystal meth .
and i think it &apos;s a new @-@ fangled fishing pole .
that &apos;s not mine !
&quot; it &apos;s not mine ! it &apos;s not mine . &quot;
whose is it , then ? what , it just fell into your net ?
listen . don &apos;t you know how these drug busts go ?
you give up the big fish-- and you will give up the big fish--
oh , and-- by the way-- your lawyer will 100 % tell you
that that &apos;s the play .
the dealer comes after you ,
chops you up into little pieces of poke
and feeds you to the sand sharks .
circle of life , babe .
but if you want to talk with us a little bit , cooperate ,
maybe we take these guys down before they find you .
okay .
okay .
okay .
all right . leung , he wouldn &apos;t go along .
go along with what ?
what we had going here .
you know , with the economy in the crapper ,
you gotta kind of improvise if you want to get paid .
so you just pick up loads
that just happen to fall off container ships ?
something like that .
okay , keep going .
and these guys we were dealing with ,
they didn &apos;t like that leung wasn &apos;t into it .
so , they said it was all or nothing ,
i had to get him in , or else they were going to
take their business someplace else .
so you had to get him-- so you shot him ?
no !
no .
guy was a pain in the ass , but i didn &apos;t kill him .
so what &apos;d you do ?
you talk it through over tea and scones ?
i went and met with him .
and i might &apos;ve brought a baseball bat ,
and he might &apos;ve fell on it a couple times ,
but that is all you &apos;re going to put on me .
so leung finds out about the drugs
and threatens to go to the police .
no .
he just didn &apos;t want his kid involved .
all right .
we &apos;re going to run this gun .
and we &apos;re going to find out
if it matches the one that killed leung .
and in the meantime ...
you and i are going to take a little walk .
hi . i &apos;m still waiting to hear back from ballistics
on the gun we found on sal &apos;s boat ,
but without a slug , it &apos;s gonna be tough .
you think he did it ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know .
i mean , his gps and his fuel logs
put him 50 miles out to sea
at the time of our victim &apos;s death .
but he has a chopper , though , right ?
no , he does not have a chopper .
the bank now has a chopper . he lost it a month ago .
you get anything off of our victim leung &apos;s computer ?
oh , yeah . the browser history shows
an article on the jordan rutherford case .
jordan rutherford is ...
okay , well ...
two months ago ,
jordan rutherford was accused
of strangling vicki hailama ,
a 19 @-@ year @-@ old college girl on spring break .
yes , i remember .
hpd &apos;s still looking for this guy .
jordan rutherford disappeared the day he became a suspect .
it was just like he vanished into thin air .
no one &apos;s seen him since .
the parents of vicki hailama made a plea today
for jordan rutherford to turn himself in .
authorities have so far been
unable to bring the murder suspect to justice .
okay . all right . so what &apos;s the connection to leung ?
this is the last thing he was
looking at the night he was killed .
maybe he couldn &apos;t sleep , and he was just surfing .
yeah , &apos; cause that &apos;s entertaining .
i mean , when i can &apos;t sleep , i watch old hockey fights
on youtube . what &apos;s up ?
those fish scales you brought back
that were inside the gunshot wound ?
they came off an etelis carbunculus .
locals call it ehu .
they &apos;re pretty rare around here these days .
in fact , according to a fish dealer ,
only one load of them was sold today .
okay . who sold it ?
it came off of leung &apos;s boat .
okay , good .
so , this guy gets killed on his own boat ,
and our number one suspect , sal ,
is off catching tuna fish at the time of death ?
unless we have any evidence that shows otherwise ,
and a search of leung &apos;s boat turned up nothing .
maybe not .
through the dealer , i was able
to track the fish to that new restaurant , morimoto .
i was thinking that maybe our killer left some evidence on it .
on the fish ? really ? you &apos;re kidding .
hello ?
yeah .
okay .
uncle said auntie mele &apos;s not going to make it through the night .
okay .
bro , we got to go .
go ahead .
mcgarrett &apos;s on his way back . we &apos;ll go see about the fish .
go on .
kono .
uncle .
um , she &apos;s in the bedroom .
she &apos;s heavily sedated , but ...
she &apos;ll be glad to see you .
i &apos;m so glad you came , chin .
it &apos;s good to see you , auntie .
kono ?
i &apos;m here , auntie .
promise me
you &apos;ll look after uncle after i &apos;m gone .
i promise .
i need to talk to you .
i &apos;ll be right back , okay ?
it &apos;s up to you
to make this thing between chin ho and your uncle right .
this is in the past .
you know , this is how we discuss this .
he won &apos;t even talk to me about it .
everything was fine between them
until i got sick ...
and then chin was dismissed
from the force .
do you think those two things are related ?
i &apos;m afraid to ask .
i will help you through this again .
i made up my mind !
why would you want to take it on for yourself ?
right here , boss !
where &apos;s the wheelchair and the cute nurse ?
funny .
what &apos;s all this ?
sorry , brah .
big sale on ice .
they had a sale on ice .
mean sale .
uh @-@ huh . i &apos;m sure glad you stopped for ice .
mahaloes for picking me up , brother .
any time , brother .
auntie knows .
knows what ?
that this thing between you and uncle has
something to do with you being kicked off the force .
is that what you two spent your time talking about ?
look , i heard you two arguing about money .
yeah , well , you heard wrong .
it was nothing .
i &apos;m thinking it was uncle who took
the money from the asset forfeiture locker ,
and you &apos;re the one who took the fall ,
but what i haven &apos;t figure out yet is why .
you know what , kono ? just drop it , okay ?
look , don &apos;t lie to me , chin !
not now !
am i right or am i not ? !
okay .
auntie got sick and needed a kidney .
but you know how hard it is to get on the donor list
for a transplant here in the islands , right ?
yeah , but she got a kidney .
she did , but she didn &apos;t get it the way that uncle said .
auntie would have died waiting on that list .
but uncle knew some people in china
who could get her one on the black market .
the thing is , nobody in our family has that kind of money .
did you know he was going to take it ?
no . uncle did what he had to do .
you could have said something .
why did you take the fall ?
you lost your badge .
what was i supposed to do ?
tell ia what really happened and watch uncle go to jail ?
you &apos;re a cop .
you &apos;re supposed to tell the truth .
sometimes things aren &apos;t so simple , kono .
i promised uncle
that auntie would be shielded from all of this .
i kept my promise .
when auntie passes , you &apos;re gonna tell the truth .
that &apos;s what uncle wants , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah , but what good is it gonna do ?
i finally found a home here with five @-@ o , kono .
whatever happened , happened .
where &apos;s the chef ?
sumimasen .
stop the music , please .
yeah . steve mcgarrett .
hi , steve .
this is detective danny williams . five @-@ o.
i &apos;m just testing my new karaoke machine .
oh . had it flown over from japan .
it &apos;s special .
it &apos;s nice .
you like karaoke ?
yes , i do .
you have a lovely voice .
i don &apos;t know .
uh , we @-@ we spoke to your fish dealer this morning .
yes ?
and he said that you purchased , well , fish .
ehu . yes , yes . ehu , yes .
can we see the catch ?
yes , i take you .
thank you . arigoto .
here you are .
this is mine-- of today .
hey , buddy , after you .
it &apos;s all you , babe . i can &apos;t get my cast wet .
that &apos;s low .
that &apos;s really low .
what exactly are we looking for ?
we &apos;ll know when we find it , so be thorough .
oh , be thorough . okay .
yeah , be thorough . check every fish , danny .
oh , okay .
all the fish in the box .
you &apos;re going to pay for this ,
100 % .
looks like a fish .
beautiful .
when you know it . another big , red fish .
nice size .
nice size , yeah .
we got a fish , we got another fish .
look at this fish .
this is a special fish , huh ?
that &apos;s a bullet hole .
yeah . you see , either
they got an interesting new way to catch fish ,
or we just found our ballistics evidence .
mushroomed . small caliber .
i bet it went into the fish
after it went through our victim .
i &apos;ll get it to the lab .
arigato .
okay .
hey , boss , how is it ?
good to have you back in one piece .
well , kono , it &apos;s good to be back in one piece .
phew ! what &apos;s that smell ?
oh , that &apos;s the sashimi special .
mm . yeah . danny went home to change his shirt .
i heard you guys lucked out at morimoto &apos;s .
we did . uh , we recovered a fired round from a .38 .
the same caliber as sal groves &apos; gun .
ballistics is running it through now . what do you got ?
all right , the lab just sent this over .
they found traces
of jet fuel on our vic &apos;s shoes ,
clothing and skin .
jet fuel . okay , he could have come
into contact with that when his body was dumped .
yeah , but , uh , the skin absorption rate suggests
that leung came into contact with it hours before his death .
oh . hey , wait a minute .
why is a fish boat captain handling jet fuel anyway ?
yeah , it &apos;s not just any jet fuel .
this stuff is a new biofuel .
there &apos;s only one airstrip on the island that uses it .
and the lab traced it back to
high blue jet charters .
the web site says they fly everywhere .
even over remote locations where you can dump a body ?
even over those .
right .
yeah , i recognize him .
it &apos;s , uh , jack leung .
worked the graveyard shift , refueling , routine maintenance .
wait a minute . he worked here ?
yeah . said he wanted to pick up some extra money .
hard worker .
always talking about his son , their fishing boat .
said times were tough on the docks .
okay , did he work last night ?
yeah , sure did . it &apos;s our busy season .
something wrong ?
yeah , something &apos;s wrong .
we found his body
in the jungle this morning .
so , we know that he came in contact with
a special kind of jet fuel several hours before his death .
like i said , he was our main gas @-@ and @-@ go guy last night .
okay . did anything out of the ordinary happen last night ?
yeah , he wanted to use the computer in the office .
something about a flight manifest .
why would he want to see a flight manifest ?
sometimes the guys-- they get curious
about the folks using the strip .
just last week , warren buffett comes through .
but you know , the ground crew--
they &apos;re more interested in rock stars , athletes .
do you remember the plane by any chance ?
no , but we didn &apos;t have any vips come through last night .
all right , can we take a look at his locker ?
yeah , it &apos;s just inside , to the left .
look what i found-- flight manifest .
that he wasn &apos;t supposed to have .
okay , the jet is owned by a lotus leaf holding company .
one @-@ way charter to hong kong .
one passenger , and there &apos;s no name .
it had to be important .
i mean , went through all the trouble of stealing it .
all right , leung goes fishing , okay ?
then he comes , he works the nightshift here ,
and he sees something .
then he comes home , and he gets killed on his own boat .
question is , what did he see that got him killed ?
lotus leaf holding company-- several companies
folded into one .
looks like an import outfit .
real estate holdings , as well .
okay , uh , bring up the incorporation paperwork
and find me a primary .
donald rutherford .
wait a minute . you think he &apos;s any relation
to jordan rutherford , the spring break strangler ?
he &apos;s his father .
okay .
wasn &apos;t leung looking up
the rutherford case right before he was murdered ?
yeah , he was .
he was , right ?
yeah .
ballistics just got a hit on that .38
you pulled out of the fish .
it wasn &apos;t from sal groves &apos; gun , but
they did get a hit . the slug came
from a gun sold at ace gun &amp; rifle .
the owner &apos;s an ex @-@ cop who registers
a ballistics profile of every gun that he sells .
guess who the buyer was .
donald rutherford .
yeah .
but why would he want to kill leung ?
i think i know why .
the flight manifest
that we pulled out of leung &apos;s locker--
it said , one passenger , right ?
yeah , but that couldn &apos;t have been donald rutherford .
that flight took off hours before leung was killed .
yeah , that &apos;s because it wasn &apos;t donald rutherford on that plane .
it was jordan rutherford .
right .
so leung witnessed donald rutherford helping his son
escape from the island .
exactly .
okay , daddy wants to keep the secret ,
so he follows leung back to the boat ,
he kills him , secret safe .
not anymore .
not anymore .
can i help you ?
mr. rutherford , steve mcgarrett from five @-@ o.
we &apos;d like a word .
i &apos;ll be right down .
okay .
you think he &apos;s running ?
yeah , i do .
donald rutherford ?
donald rutherford ?
go .
this door &apos;s locked .
okay .
the window &apos;s are all shut . he &apos;s still in here .
all right , i &apos;m gonna call a k @-@ 9 unit .
no , no , wait . i &apos;ve got a better idea .
just wait here .
come on , come on , where are you ?
he &apos;s in the floor .
the son of a bitch is in the floor .
donald rutherford ,
put the gun down right now .
i &apos;m not gonna do that .
you know why we &apos;re here ?
i &apos;m not a stupid man .
okay ,
you were trying to protect your son .
okay , i get that .
you don &apos;t get anything .
you have no idea what it &apos;s like
to see your boy &apos;s name dragged through the papers ...
hunted .
let me ask you a question .
how long you think you were gonna hide him down here , huh ?
you were just doing what any good father would do , all right ?
okay ... okay ,
you see this ?
i &apos;m gonna put my weapon away , okay ?
don &apos;t shoot me , now .
you shoot me , he &apos;s gonna shoot you , and it &apos;ll be a big mess .
the guy you shot , his name was jack leung .
hey . leung ,
he took that other job so that he could take care of his son .
what happened , did jack catch you trying to smuggle your son
out of the country , is that what happened ?
he knew .
after weeks of hiding my son and trying to get him out ,
i wasn &apos;t gonna let that man mess things up .
jordan &apos;s all i have .
he &apos;s not some monster .
well ... he killed that girl .
her name was vicki hailama .
he made a mistake , a stupid mistake--
and he should pay with his whole life ?
&quot; stupid mistake &quot; ?
no , he strangled that girl .
he strangled her because she
wouldn &apos;t go up to his hotel room ,
and then he dumped her body in the ocean .
it &apos;s not a stupid mistake-- that &apos;s what your son did .
well , he &apos;s safe now .
and if you think i &apos;m gonna tell you
where he is , you &apos;re wrong-- dead wrong .
this your son ?
don &apos;t you touch that .
i don &apos;t understand what my father
was doing working at that airstrip .
he was doing it to help you pay for the boat .
he never said anything .
i knew he wanted me to take over the boat ,
but i would have made it on my own .
not with what was going on here .
that &apos;s why he took the job at the airstrip--
to help you ... and your family .
your father saw jordan rutherford ,
and he knew he was wanted for murder .
so donald rutherford followed him here ?
because of what your father did ,
jordan rutherford &apos;s been picked up by hong kong police .
he &apos;s being extradited to stand trial for murder .
we &apos;re going to his favorite spot
