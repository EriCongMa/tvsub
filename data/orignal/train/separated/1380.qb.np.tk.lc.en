dickwad who bought this triumph should try going to the gym
to bulk up instead of asking you to modify it for power .
i ain &apos;t modifying anything .
i &apos;m tearing it apart and putting it back together .
charging him 400 bucks .
sweet gear set .
yeah , this drive belt is pretty smooth , too .
you should convince your guy it &apos;s not his kind of ride .
sells it back to you cheap .
my nephew needs a new bike .
you mother --
ah , the spicy mustard .
i thought angela was gonna choke .
oh , where are you guys ?
that street fair in newton .
yeah , where was i ?
on a stakeout ?
have you talked to agent davies ?
no . not yet .
aw ! that &apos;s a great picture of frankie . look at that .
where was this ?
we tried to get into a celtics game ,
but we couldn &apos;t get tickets .
so we just sat outside and ate pizza .
i didn &apos;t do this .
no , i think you were going through receipts
to identify a witness .
ah , the yacht races !
i &apos;m not in that one , am i ?
i didn &apos;t even ask you to go .
maura !
i just ...
i thought we were supposed to be pictures
to put in my home pictures that ,
in theory , reflect my life experience .
and i did . i found that picture of our trip from l.a.
one .
okay . and i am sure ...
i &apos;m gonna -- i &apos;m gonna f-- i &apos;m gonna keep looking .
and i did tell angela to go through her pictures ,
so i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll bring some by .
what ?
oh , this ? you mean keep reading this ?
i don &apos;t know . is it that awful ?
no . it &apos;s great .
you &apos;re just saying that because you &apos;re my friend .
no , i would -- i would totally read this book .
i would --i would read it if there were more of it .
is there more of it ?
well , no . that &apos;s it . one chapter .
but you really like it ?
yeah . i really do .
isles .
rizzoli .
what was that for ?
i &apos;m taking a picture of us
reading the first chapter of your best @-@ seller .
you know , a picture that i &apos;m actually in .
yeah .
the sway bar bushing on my sidecar needs to be looked at .
maybe i should bring it here .
i &apos;d wait till they get new mechanics .
feels like an execution to me .
killer was pretty close with a shotgun .
so this guy takes one to the chest .
the other guy tries to make a run for it ,
gets hit in the back .
uniforms found a loaded handgun on that shelf .
neither of them made a move to get it , though ,
which means they knew the killer and didn &apos;t suspect any danger ,
or he was really quiet and snuck up on &apos; em .
light @-@ footed .
or he flew .
you thinking a fairy ?
they are the natural enemy of a biker .
well , i think you &apos;re spot on
with your cause of death , sergeant .
but i &apos;m not so sure i believe in
your tinker bell theory , detective .
too small to carry the gun ?
no , there &apos;s just no pixie dust on our crime scene .
you know what ? looks like a lipstick smudge .
if the killer was a girlfriend ,
maybe that explains how she got so close without them reacting .
well , i &apos;m not ready to give up on my fairy theory yet .
this is a weird place for fingerprints .
okay , i &apos;m ready .
rest of the guns are on their way .
the first load is laid out for your examination .
thank you .
so if the serial numbers have been removed ,
we may be able to pull some up chemically .
make sure the techs check the metal for ridges .
sure . will do .
hello , mister ... leo .
and according to his right pectoral ,
his mother &apos;s name was gladys .
it &apos;s hard not to see these tattoos as premature obituaries .
mm , archeologists now theorize that the earliest tattoos
may have been therapeutic ,
an attempt to alleviate pain , perhaps .
i &apos;m sure he got a lot of comfort from that one --
&quot; if it don &apos;t roar , it don &apos;t soar . &quot;
well , i didn &apos;t say that was the current thinking .
okay , so i will start the autopsy ,
and you process the lipstick .
there &apos;s a possibility that there &apos;s a foreign dna
in that sample .
unless he was wearing it and didn &apos;t like the color .
so a guy who was out walking his dog last night
says he saw a woman running from the repair shop
about the time of the shooting .
he get a good look at her ?
no . it was dark and he just saw someone running .
he says he thinks it was a woman because she ran like a girl .
did he see a gun ?
no .
so he might &apos;ve seen someone exercising .
yep . you two got anything ?
both our vics rode with the lords of thunder .
leo was top dog , and grimm was his lieutenant .
according to organized crime ,
the l.o.t. has been doing business with some albanians .
well , the albanians buying the guns or selling them ?
selling , i think .
maybe our bikers found a cheaper source and reneged on the deal ?
kelly wagner .
okay .
that &apos;s a dna match for lipstick we found on the biker .
okay , she was in foster care .
yeah , a pretty steady work history .
known associate of the lords of thunder .
short sheet . nonviolent crimes only .
double homicide seems like a bit of a stretch .
so maybe she &apos;s the witness .
you got an address ?
nothing current , but she does have an ebt card .
she uses it almost exclusively in dorchester ,
including ... 20 minutes ago .
i &apos;ll get jane . you two get in a car .
send her picture to uniforms in the area .
if she &apos;s a witness to a double homicide ,
we need to find her before the killer does .
okay , thank you .
i &apos;ve got nothing .
jane and korsak finished .
they &apos;re moving a few blocks over .
excuse me , ma &apos;am .
bpd . we &apos;re looking for this woman .
do you know her ? have you seen her recently ?
no .
can you take a closer look ? it &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know her . sorry .
put it down !
put it down !
thanks , nina .
coral blush .
same shade of lipstick we found smudged on leo danner .
a smudge that happens to have your dna in it .
we also have an eyewitness that saw a woman leaving the scene
of leo and grimm &apos;s murder .
easy enough to set up a lineup ,
let the witness identify you .
look , i understand your instinct to stay silent ,
but if you are the shooter , we &apos;ll prove it .
the d.a. will go a lot easier on you if you cooperate .
yeah , if you &apos;re an innocent witness ,
someone out there is gonna want you dead .
we can keep that from happening .
associating with the lords of thunder
is a violation of your parole for possession .
we &apos;ll just send you downtown till you decided
to change your mind and talk to us .
you can &apos;t do that .
then talk to us .
i &apos;ve got nothing to say .
call us if you change your mind .
okay , if i scramble all these ,
how long do you think it would take you
to put them back together ?
well , i wouldn &apos;t bother because the ones without
evidentiary value are destined for the crusher .
which means at least one of them has evidentiary value .
yes , but just one .
so as you &apos;d expect ,
the serial numbers were filed down .
but all the guns were wiped clean , which is unusual ,
but we were able to pull a single partial print .
which is not enough for court .
but it is enough to identify a suspect .
endrit amiti .
american @-@ albanian .
well , he &apos;s been arrested enough times ,
but none of the charges have stuck .
you know what ?
this will be great for your book .
you &apos;re writing a book ?
yes , she is .
i &apos;ve just written one chapter .
oh . and am i in it ?
i could be a dashing scottish medical examiner &apos;s assistant .
yeah !
if that doesn &apos;t scream &quot; best @-@ seller , &quot;
i don &apos;t know what does .
you -- you will be in the acknowledgments .
right .
well , just don &apos;t make me english .
i &apos;ll never live it down .
oh , my god . please make him english .
please , please , please make him english !
put it down !
put it down !
put it down !
how &apos;s your head ?
doc says my melon &apos;s a @-@ ok .
wanna grab lunch ? i &apos;m craving indian .
no .
you okay ?
i &apos;m worried ...
about that kelly wagner takedown .
i @-@ i feel like ...
i wasn &apos;t completely in control .
no , that &apos;s not true .
my finger was on the trigger .
i didn &apos;t need to have my finger on the trigger .
i shouldn &apos;t have -- - you didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
what if i shot her ?
you didn &apos;t .
i don &apos;t think we should go in the field together .
you are overreacting .
telling me my feelings aren &apos;t valid
doesn &apos;t make me feel any better .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i didn &apos;t --
i &apos;ll talk to you later .
what the feds tell us is that you and your friends
are the most dangerous criminals on the east coast .
is that supposed to be some kind of compliment ?
they say that you play by new rules ,
basically no rules at all .
&quot; give us what we want or die philosophy &quot; is what they say .
one would not have many friends if one lived a life like that .
these your friends ?
who are these people ?
we found your fingerprint on a gun in one of their shops .
we &apos;re not buying that you don &apos;t know them .
are you implying that i am part of some kind
of criminal enterprise ?
no , no , we &apos;re saying that .
we &apos;re saying that you killed these two men
because they made you angry or they ...
cut in line in front of you at starbucks .
i have done nothing .
well , we &apos;re gonna hold you on an illegal firearms charge
while we check that out .
you would be wise --
oh , shut up .
talk to you after you &apos;ve been processed .
we interviewed most of the bikers who aren &apos;t currently in jail .
stonewalled by one and all .
&quot; the code &quot; is holding .
if there &apos;s any vengeance to be had ,
they &apos;re planning on getting it themselves .
okay , what about the albanians ?
well , they &apos;re trickier to track down ,
but we &apos;re working our way through the list .
well , endrit amiti &apos;s warrant
should be ready within the hour .
as much of a jackass of epic proportions that i think he is ,
i believed him when he said he didn &apos;t kill leo and grimm .
and what about kelly wagner ?
did we find anything else background @-@ wise ?
her last known address was near the shop .
neighbor said she moved away six months ago .
ebt card fits the same timeline ,
as does a job she picked up at a bar in dorchester .
okay , what about this ?
new job , better neighborhood ,
maybe she wants a better life , leo didn &apos;t wanna let her go .
she could &apos;ve moved further away .
shooting him seems excessive .
i know . you &apos;re right . i hate my theory .
just got off the phone with the warden
at the suffolk county jail .
someone got to kelly already ?
no , he has a jailhouse snitch
who says kelly &apos;s trying to hire a hit man .
she just went in six hours ago .
she &apos;s desperate ,
which tells me she &apos;s probably our witness .
she &apos;s scared for her safety , and she &apos;s trying to get
to the killer before he gets to her .
i &apos;ll bet we figure out who her target is , we wrap up this case .
she &apos;s not gonna talk to us . so what do we do ?
maybe i get myself arrested .
because prisons are dangerous ,
studies show that inmates become hypervigilant
about signs of threat .
so a tough veneer projects a threat of violence ,
which keeps other inmates at bay .
so you think i should put on a tough veneer ?
oh , you have a tough veneer .
maybe even have tough under veneer .
i &apos;m suggesting you keep it .
okay , so how far up the neck do you wanna go ?
well , i don &apos;t know . how long does this fruit stuff stay on ?
it &apos;s not actually a fruit .
it &apos;s the ink made out of an extract of fruit .
maura ...
it &apos;s the genipa americana .
so a week or two depending on how quickly you exfoliate .
i don &apos;t know how quickly i exfoliate .
all right , so let &apos;s say two weeks .
not the face .
okay .
your cover &apos;s set .
hey .
federal d.o.c. has existing aliases for operations like this .
you are lisa caro .
you &apos;re being brought in for an extradition hearing .
i hate the name lisa .
relax . you &apos;ll only have it for a couple of days .
that &apos;s as long as i &apos;m gonna let you stay in suffolk .
i can stay in there as long as i need to .
no , you can &apos;t . it &apos;s not safe . that &apos;s a good @-@ looking tattoo .
oh , thank you .
the warden is moving any inmates
that might have possibly intersected with you .
arrested by bpd homicide ,
relatives arrested by homicide ,
any women who went to high school with you ,
grew up in your neighborhood .
well , that could be a lot .
can you not ?
well , how about the relatives of police personnel ?
good question . i &apos;ll confirm .
the snitch who gave us the tip is also being moved .
she may get suspicious when you show up so soon after the tip
and be willing to settle that suspicion for a pack of smokes .
all right .
oh , you can &apos;t believe the photos that i found .
hey , ma .
what &apos;s going on ?
why are you getting such an enormous tattoo ?
jane ?
yeah , uh ...
okay . um , you know what ?
ma , can i , uh , talk to you ? just in here for a minute ?
please ?
everything &apos;s fine , okay ? um ...
jane , what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m going undercover .
where ?
the county jail .
oh , my lord .
ma , it &apos;s just to find information . that &apos;s all .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
it &apos;s a double homicide .
i &apos;m trying to stop somebody else from being killed .
okay , i support you in that . but this is too much .
ma , it &apos;s my --
don &apos;t say it ! don &apos;t say &quot; job . &quot;
say &quot; christmas , &quot; say &quot; frog . &quot;
yeah , that doesn &apos;t really make any sense , ma . &quot; it &apos;s my frog &quot; --
shut up , jane .
first korsak &apos;s wedding , ron and my breakup .
there are consequences for the rest of us .
ma ...
isn &apos;t being a cop enough ?
now you have to be a cop
that puts herself with a bunch of criminals ?
korsak and maura would never let anything happen .
i know that .
and you &apos;ll probably be fine .
then you &apos;ll come home , and we &apos;ll --
we &apos;ll all pretend it &apos;s normal
to think about what you &apos;d look like in a casket .
i bet you &apos;d look great .
ma .
you got something off the clothes from endrit &apos;s apartment ?
oh . yes , i do .
blood splatter consistent with a gunshot and a pair of shoes .
although the blood doesn &apos;t belong to either of our victims .
well , that &apos;s a twist i didn &apos;t see coming .
the soles of the shoes also had commercial soap
and laundry detergent on them .
so i was thinking a murderer in a laundromat ?
thanks . i &apos;ll check it out .
yeah . oh , hey .
um , i won a @-@ a raffle the other day
and i got this gift certificate
for a restaurant on the east side .
i was thinking the three of us could go sometime ?
oh . right .
you guys are a great couple .
you really bring out the best in each other .
i &apos;ll , uh , check and ...
okay .
put you in wagner &apos;s dorm ,
a couple beds down from her so it &apos;s not too obvious .
there are only two guards who know your status .
we &apos;ll work 12 @-@ hour shifts for as long as you &apos;re here .
we &apos;re thinking two days tops .
probably smart .
the tats are nice , but probably won &apos;t take long
for someone to smell you &apos;re a cop , and mess you up .
you make going to jail sound very unappealing .
now we need a safe word or a phrase
so we know you &apos;ll want to be extracted .
pick something you &apos;ll remember if you &apos;re scared or stressed .
not too common that you &apos;d accidentally use it
in a regular prison conversation .
walrus .
i had a cat named walrus .
i thought you hated cats .
walrus is why .
there &apos;s only so much we can do without drawing
the wrong sort of attention your way , okay ?
yeah . yeah , okay .
you &apos;re just trying to figure out who kelly wagner wants dead
so we can solve the biker murder .
that &apos;s all we need .
check on ma , all right ?
i will .
you be careful ...
or your mother won &apos;t be the only one who wants to smack you .
thanks .
just eggs .
take a biscuit . they &apos;re good .
very good .
no , thanks .
i &apos;m not kidding . it &apos;s the only thing worth eating .
nothing personal .
i &apos;ll have hers .
thanks .
it &apos;s better if you don &apos;t watch people .
i agree .
how long you gonna be here ?
i &apos;ve got three months left on six .
grand theft . jewelry .
my whole career .
first time i ever got caught .
what &apos;d you do ?
you know what ? they say i killed somebody .
and maybe i did or maybe i didn &apos;t ,
but i &apos;m willing to kill you and stay here if it &apos;ll shut you up .
so korsak and frankie looked into it .
turns out there was an unsolved homicide involving a victim
who was stuffed into a dryer at a laundromat .
did it match the same chemicals that we found on endrit &apos;s shoes ?
exact same product profile .
endrit made this mistake .
he might have made others .
call upstairs and get the case files on any unsolved homicides
that fit this profile .
what profile ?
well , somebody stuffs you in a dryer ,
they &apos;re looking to make a point .
it &apos;s not about the victim . he &apos;s already dead .
it &apos;s about the people who know the victim or who know you .
so theatrical murders ?
it &apos;s one way to put it .
you got it .
hi , angela .
hey , have you heard anything ?
no . no , but i don &apos;t know that we will .
yeah , unless there &apos;s a problem .
there &apos;s not going to be a problem .
come on , we have to trust jane to take care of herself .
yeah , right .
you know , i remember when she was little , about 5 @-@ ish .
i was looking out the -- the kitchen window .
she was climbing up this stupid little tree that
that could barely hold a bird .
it was hard ,
but i made myself stand there ,
hoping that she &apos;d realize it wasn &apos;t safe .
what happened ?
she slipped . fell about 10 feet .
by the time i ran out to the backyard ,
she was chasing frankie
and tommy down the side of the house .
am i always going to be this scared ?
i was just looking for someone to talk to .
yeah , okay .
you &apos;d rather it not be you .
no offense .
god , this place sucks .
what kind of jewelry ?
excuse me ?
what kind of jewelry did you steal ?
the shiny kind .
i &apos;m telling you for your own good ,
you really need to stay out of other people &apos;s business .
hey , i got gum -- - i have no money .
i got cigarettes . you gotta need something , girl .
what &apos;s your problem , you shit @-@ brained little turd ?
oh , i bet you say that to everybody .
hey , don &apos;t you walk away from me .
back off !
what &apos;s going on ?
nothin &apos; .
absolutely nothin &apos; .
oh , you , too ?
skinny bitch .
thanks .
she doesn &apos;t like to talk .
well , i @-@ i appreciate the help .
i &apos;m only here for another day , and i didn &apos;t mean to help .
three unsolved murders in the last two years
with interesting disposal characteristics --
hung from a lamppost , tied to the front of a truck ,
those qualify as theatrical .
we &apos;re trying to see if we can tie endrit &apos;s crew to any of these .
have you found anything to tie him to the bikers &apos; murders ?
no .
maybe the albanians had nothing to do with these killings .
mm , too early to draw that conclusion .
but hung from a lamppost was killed with a shotgun .
that &apos;s the same as our biker murders .
what is it ?
oh . just these two victims , they , uh ,
both have industrial chemicals in their clothes ,
not laundry chemicals but ...
no , but acids , alkalines , solvents .
the kind of things used in illegal activities .
drug manufacture , bombs .
yes .
so what if that &apos;s the unifying thread of our murders ?
industrial chemicals ? sale of , theft of .
we &apos;ll start trying to make those links . thanks .
korsak , have you heard from jane ?
no .
let me know when you do .
i will .
frankie .
so i &apos;ve been thinking about what you said ,
and i have a question .
if it had been the same situation
and jane had been the one on the ground ,
what would you have done ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll tell you -- the same thing .
you didn &apos;t shoot anybody . you protected me ,
just ...
just like you wish you could &apos;ve protected marcus .
you were just doing your job ,
and maybe in the midst of it , you realized that ...
you can really feel again
after a long time of being too scared to do that .
you didn &apos;t shoot anyone .
i didn &apos;t die .
so don &apos;t pull away , okay ?
you gotta pee , do it somewhere else .
oh , come on .
no , you come on .
you know what ? you &apos;re too pretty for me to mess up .
how &apos; bout we be friends ?
get off me , man .
what , cowboy ? there &apos;s nothing to see here .
what ?
there a problem here ?
no , uh ...
there was some water . they slipped .
get these women into the infirmary .
let &apos;s take you , too .
what ? no , i &apos;m fine .
what about her ?
beats the shit out of me . i don &apos;t know .
let &apos;s get &apos; em up , get &apos; em out of here .
dr. isles .
you are receiving a call
from an inmate at suffolk county jail .
please press 1 to accept it .
jane .
hey . i @-@ i couldn &apos;t reach vince .
are you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
do you need anything ?
can you come home ?
what &apos;s the holdup on my hearing ?
what ?
sorry . um , no ...
and no .
okay , uh ...
uh , just , you know ,
i &apos;d like to get cleared , get the hell out of here , you know ?
all right , this is like a bad game show .
but i get it . you can &apos;t talk freely .
so i will tell you what we know .
okay , good .
it looks like we can tie the albanians
to a number of open investigations .
but we haven &apos;t been able to tie them to the biker murders .
okay . what about my girl ?
kelly ?
yeah .
we haven &apos;t found anything new .
all right , well , then i guess i &apos;ll have to work it out on my own .
be careful . be really careful , jane . we &apos;re all --
your call limit has been reached
and this connection is being terminated .
... really worried about you .
so you said you &apos;re not gonna be here very long ?
my hearing &apos;s tomorrow .
charges get dropped . case falls apart . i &apos;m a free woman .
you looking for work ?
yeah , i &apos;m always looking to better myself .
&apos;cause i have something .
well , spit it out , sweetheart .
i need someone ...
taken care of .
you shittin &apos; me ?
no .
i &apos;ve got $ 10,000 .
i can get it to you once it &apos;s done .
how hard &apos;s the job ?
he goes by snake .
his real name is jeff morgan .
he &apos;s with the lords of thunder .
what did he do ?
you want the job or not ?
i &apos;ll think about it .
you know , i really liked my cat .
you did ?
his name was walrus .
hey , i got your text .
i didn &apos;t wanna wake all of you up .
and i really , really needed a shower .
and ...
i called ma a few times . she hasn &apos;t picked up yet .
it &apos;s early .
that &apos;s quite a bruise .
it &apos;s nothing .
it will be in a couple of weeks , but right now ,
it &apos;s a pretty nice bruise .
yes , it is .
your mom will call you back .
she &apos;s probably just ... relieved that you &apos;re okay
and she needs a minute .
yes , i &apos;m sure that &apos;s it .
well , it &apos;s hard to worry about our loved ones .
we always want to protect them .
you &apos;ve certainly done plenty of that .
i have .
so did you get what you needed ?
i did .
i have to get to work .
but we didn &apos;t finish our coffee .
i know . come on . come on , come on !
oh , gosh .
get the jacket . jacket , jacket , jacket ! come on !
all right .
wow , that &apos;s a big tattoo .
i know . i &apos;m kinda starting to like it .
um , when you were digging into kelly &apos;s family ,
did you find anything ?
nope .
her parents died when she was in her teens .
she was in foster homes until she aged out of the system .
i think we missed something . can you look again ?
okay .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you &apos;re trying to kill him . i just wanna know why .
what the hell ?
you did all this just to --
kelly , we &apos;re just trying to help .
shit . you don &apos;t know what you &apos;ve done .
okay , fine . then tell us .
come on , you putting a hit out on snake ?
that had zero chance of success . you know that .
and if you were just trying to protect yourself ,
you could &apos;ve ratted him out a lot sooner .
but you weren &apos;t trying to protect yourself ,
were you , kelly ?
you were trying to protect your half @-@ sister , marley .
we &apos;d do anything to protect our family , wouldn &apos;t we ?
especially when they can &apos;t protect themselves .
she was there , wasn &apos;t she ?
she &apos;s the one who saw snake kill leo and grimm .
yes .
and now because of me , she &apos;s probably dead , too .
did you find her ?
no .
i took her out of that awful foster home she was in .
you know , i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i ...
i should &apos;ve gotten her out of boston .
and marley was sure that it was snake ?
she definitely said , &quot; snake hurt leo . &quot;
i told her to meet me at our safe spot .
and i was out getting extra supplies
when you guys grabbed me .
why have an exit strategy ?
for something like this .
she was my responsibility .
what was she supposed to do if you didn &apos;t show up ?
after three days , she knows to go to the police .
well , she hasn &apos;t called , and she &apos;s not at the safe spot .
which means either snake got her
or she left &apos; cause she thought she was supposed to .
why would she think that ?
oh , my god .
was my cellphone at my apartment ?
no .
no .
snake probably found it when he was looking for her .
her name isn &apos;t in it ,
but eventually he &apos;d figure out what number &apos;s hers .
all right , uh , write her number down , okay ?
and -- and maybe we &apos;ll get lucky and find it .
okay ?
jane .
is she okay ?
is she okay ?
hi , doggy . what &apos;s your name ?
her name &apos;s daisy .
hi , daisy . hi . you &apos;re so cute .
kelly !
i &apos;m so happy to see you .
thanks for letting me borrow your dog .
no problem . i &apos;m okay . are you okay ?
it &apos;s pretty simple .
