i hear you and joshua are going out with ross and emily .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
i think you &apos;re handling that really well .
&quot; handling it &quot; ? there &apos;s nothing to handle .
maybe i &apos;d have a problem with this if it wasn &apos;t for me and joshua .
they &apos;re not going to get married anyway .
they rushed into this thing so fast , it &apos;s ridiculous !
they &apos;ll be engaged for like what ? a year ?
one of them will realize what they &apos;ve done ... and call it off .
you &apos;ll be dancing at my wedding before you dance at theirs .
you know , i don &apos;t dance at weddings .
why not ? weddings are a great place to meet women .
when i dance , i look like this .
hey , man .
what are you doing four weeks from today ?
nothing .
nothing .
i am ...
... free .
because we &apos;re getting married in a month .
what ?
yes .
in a month ?
you mean 30 days ?
yeah .
from now ?
that &apos;s great !
she always wanted to get married where her parents did ...
... but it &apos;s getting torn down .
i know it &apos;s crazy , but everything &apos;s been so crazy ...
... and it just feels right .
hey , that &apos;s the day after i start menstruating !
this isn &apos;t mine .
hey , rachel . -hi .
what &apos;s up ?
your voice sounded all squeaky on the phone .
nothing . i just wanted to see you .
see you and hug you .
see you .... great !
sit .
you okay ?
i &apos;m more than okay . i am really , really happy .
want to know why ?
do l ?
because i am really happy about us .
i think we are so on the right track .
i think we are working . i think we are clicking .
you know ?
yeah , sure , sure.we &apos;re clicking .
if there was just one little area where ... i think we need to work on , i would think
... it &apos;s that we &apos;re just not crazy enough .
i got to say , i &apos;m not too sure i agree with that .
you know , yeah , you &apos;re right.we have our fun . yeah ?
i mean , like crazy ! you know ?
are you gonna put on that cheerleader outfit again ?
no . you wish .
all right .
this is going to sound , you know , a little hasty .
but just go with me .
what if we got married ?
what ?
oh , i know . it &apos;s so totally like ...
... &quot; whoa , can we do this ? &quot; you know ?
but it just feels right . don &apos;t you think it does ?
i mean , it just feels right . don &apos;t you ... ?
rachel ... you &apos;re ... a real ... special lady .
but my divorce isn &apos;t final yet ... and we &apos;ve been on four dates .
so i &apos;m thinking : no ...
... but ... thanks .

sir ?
yes , he did.all right . we &apos;ll call you in a few minutes .

i &apos;m chandler .
i &apos;m marjorie .
do you mind if i sit ?

so what are you in for ? i talk in my sleep .
what a coincidence ! i listen in my sleep .
so why don &apos;t you give me your number ?
are you ready ?
i got it ! mine !
congratulations !
thank you !
my turn , my turn !
okay , ready ?
that was a terrible throw !
i won &apos;t throw it right to you . that &apos;s not real .
look at me . my big concern is what &apos;s real ?
oh , my god ! we &apos;re really sad , aren &apos;t we ?
yeah , i think we are .
this isn &apos;t even my dress .
at least you didn &apos;t rent yours from a store called &quot; it &apos;s not too late . &quot;
i &apos;m changing out of this .
me , too .
in half an hour ? me , too .
all right , now throw it straight this time .
i &apos;m getting married !
i hate my regular clothes now .
i look down and i know ... this won &apos;t be the most special day of my life .
i mean , it was kind of fun for a while ...
... but didn &apos;t you feel kind of silly ? i guess .
oh , my god !
you &apos;re such a cheater !
hello , little ones .
so , is joey going to stop snoring ?
yep !
and a beautiful woman agreed to go out with me .
joey wanted to ask her out , but , you know , she picked me .
how &apos;d that happen ?
because i &apos;m cooler .
no , seriously .
she &apos;s the kind of girl .... joey was unconscious .
hey , you guys ! what &apos;s happening ?
oh , my god ! what is that ?
they gave it to me at the sleep clinic ... and it &apos;s going to help me not to snore .
well , are you asleep right now , joe ? you don &apos;t have to wear it unless you are .
i know i don &apos;t have to .
it tastes good .
plus , you look cool .
hope i didn &apos;t stretch emily &apos;s dress .
your butt &apos;s not that much bigger than her &apos;s .
i just called joshua.how &apos;d it go ?
i did my best to convince him that i &apos;m not ... some crazy girl who &apos;s dying to get married .
and i &apos;m going through a hard time .
what &apos;d he say ? his answering machine was very understanding .
i feel blue .
i bet you anything he &apos;ll call you again .
yeah , maybe . but , you know , i don &apos;t think i even care .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s the one i &apos;m sad about .
i know i said i &apos;m totally okay with ross getting married .
but as it turns out ... i don &apos;t think i &apos;m handling it all that well .
yeah , maybe .
and i &apos;m just trying to figure out why.any luck ?
you know how ross and i have always been on @-@ again , off @-@ again ?
i guess i just figured , somewhere down the road ... we would be on again.again.
you know what ? i think we all did .
i got us reservations for sunday night.how about ernie &apos;s at 9 : 00 ?
well , you &apos;d better make it for three .
i don &apos;t know if we &apos;re going to be hungry at three .
three people.joshua &apos;s not going to be there .
what happened ? well , i think he broke up with me .
no . why ?
apparently , he scares easy .
rachel , i &apos;m sorry.it &apos;s okay .
sometimes things don &apos;t work out the way you thought they would .
come here .
don &apos;t you have to go pick up emily ?
are you okay ?
yeah . i got my girls .
awful
hey , you know what might cheer you up ? what ?
i got to tell you ... this really does put me in a better mood .
i wish there was a job where i could wear this all the time .
maybe someday there will be .
chandler &apos;s coming by to borrow candles for his big date .
rachel , don &apos;t get it ! he &apos;ll see us !
the groom cannot see the bride .
i &apos;m not going to marry chandler.not after this !
okay guys , just relax .
i do !
i got to go .
oh my god joshua
yeah , well , that ought to do it .
food &apos;s here . fair enough .
fifteen @-@ minute warning.late.
dude , i am trying to sleep !
