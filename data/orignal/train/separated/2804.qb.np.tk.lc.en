here you go , pheebs .
who wants one of my special home @-@ baked brownies ?
i &apos;ll have one .
that &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m not having one .
no , no . it &apos;s just my tooth .
all right .
i &apos;ll have one .
so you need a dentist ? i &apos;ve got a good one .
thanks . i have a good one too . i just can &apos;t see him .
see , that is the problem with invisible dentists .
lt &apos;s very unsettling to see all those metal tools just flying around .
why can &apos;t you go to him ?
because every time i go to the dentist , somebody dies .
that &apos;s so weird . every time i go to the dentist ...
... i look down the hygienist &apos;s blouse .
what ?
first it was my aunt mary .
and then there was john , my mailman .
and then my cowboy friend , albino bob .
and all these people actually died ?
yes . while i was in the chair .
that &apos;s why i take care of my teeth . it &apos;s not about oral hygiene .
i floss to save lives .
come on , you didn &apos;t kill anybody .
these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist .
it &apos;s just a coincidence .
tell that to them . oh , you can &apos;t ! they &apos;re dead !
the one with the giant poking device
thanks , gunther .
can i get a napkin too ?
oh , like you don &apos;t already have everything .
you &apos;re in pain . would you just go to the dentist ? just go .
fine . but if you &apos;re my next victim ...
... don &apos;t come back as a poltergeist who sucks me into the tv set .
i promise .
although , don &apos;t feel like you can &apos;t visit .
hey , is chandler here ?
no . no , he &apos;s not .
you guys , joey just saw janice kissing her ex @-@ husband .
what ?
what are you gonna do ? how are you gonna tell chandler ?
i was thinking about that . i think the best way would be ...
... to not .
joey , if you know about this , you have to tell him .
it &apos;ll kill him . it &apos;ll just kill him .
wait till i go to the dentist . maybe i &apos;ll kill him .
i think naked guy &apos;s using a hammock . it &apos;s like a play @-@ doh fat factory .
i &apos;m going to the dentist . so listen ...
... just be on the lookout for anything that you could fall into ...
... or that can fall on you ...
... or ....
all right , just look out !
and i also just want to ....
i just want to tell you all that ....
i have a problem . i have to go into work for a few hours .
some kids messed up the homo sapien display .
what did they do ?
they painted over the word &quot; sapien , &quot; for one thing .
then they rearranged the figures . let &apos;s just leave it at that .
do you want me to watch ben for you ?
that &apos;s what i was gonna ask . thank you .
wait , hello ! what about me ?
you . you want to watch ben ?
that would be great ! i just asked monica ...
... because i know how empty her life is .
i got a science question .
if the homo sapiens were , in fact , &quot; homo &quot; sapiens ...
... is that why they &apos;re extinct ?
joey , homo sapiens are people .
hey , i &apos;m not judging .
look , benny ! spoon !
spoon !
come on . all right , you know what ? i think he &apos;s bored .
here . you wanna play the airplane game ?
you wanna show rachel ? come here .
you wanna do something fun ? okay .
you &apos;re so brave . you &apos;re so brave ! yes , you are .
you &apos;re so brave . -you &apos;re okay .
he &apos;s fine . let &apos;s just put him down .
come here , babe . yes , you &apos;re such a good boy .
how could you do that to him ? ! ross trusted me ! what &apos;s he gonna say ?
nothing , because we &apos;re not telling him .
we &apos;re not ?
no .
all right , i like that .
so we &apos;re okay . we &apos;re okay , aren &apos;t we ?
no , we &apos;re not okay . there &apos;s a bump .
what bump ?
oh , my god ! well , push it in ! push it in !
i cannot push it in !
okay , we &apos;re gonna need a distraction .
that &apos;s it .
i got it !
the second ross walks in ...
... take him to your bedroom and do whatever you do ...
... that makes him go &quot; rheeeee ! &quot;
or ...
... we could put a hat on his head .
a hat ! yes ! we need a hat ! where are we gonna find a tiny little hat ?
i &apos;ll get rainy day bear !
because he &apos;ll know what to do ?
oh , my god . you &apos;re a genius !
it &apos;s kind of sewn on .
give it . give it .
it &apos;s just like a bloodbath in here today !
hey , hold on a second . hold on a second .
do you think these pearls are nice ?
i &apos;d prefer a mountain bike .
janice &apos;s birthday &apos;s coming . i wanna get her something special .
come in here with me .
wait !
you wanna get her something special ? get her flowers .
get her candy . get her gum . girls love gum .
that &apos;s a good idea . &quot; dear janice : have a hubba @-@ bubba birthday . &quot;
i &apos;d like to get her something serious .
you want something serious .
you know what you should do ? you should get her one of those ...
... barium enemas .
those are dead serious .
and you know she &apos;ll never get one for herself .
look , i &apos;m gonna go in here . and you don &apos;t buy me anything , ever !
you can &apos;t ! you can &apos;t . you can &apos;t buy her pearls .
you just can &apos;t , you can &apos;t , you can &apos;t !
why not ?
oh , god .
here &apos;s the thing .
this is the thing . okay , the thing is
what is the thing ?
i went down to the mattress king &apos;s showroom ...
... and i saw janice kissing her ex @-@ husband .
what ?
they were in his office .
she wouldn &apos;t do that . she &apos;s with me .
i &apos;m telling you , i saw it .
well , you &apos;re wrong . you &apos;re wrong .
i &apos;m not wrong .
i wish i was .
i &apos;m sorry .
bet that barium enema doesn &apos;t sound so bad now .
it makes more sense as an ensemble . and it takes the focus off the hat .
oh ! you &apos;re alive ! you &apos;re alive !
i promised you no one would die , didn &apos;t l ?
we &apos;ll see about that . can i use your phone to call everyone i know ?

monica bang !
okay , i heard that .
did he just say , &quot; monica bang &quot; ?
oh , my god ! he &apos;s gonna rat me out !
monica bang !
sweetie , you need to stop saying that now .
it &apos;s no big deal . it &apos;s not even worth mentioning .

see ? watch this .
monica bang ! everybody bang !
ben bang !
rachel bang !
bang , rachel ! bang !
oh , isn &apos;t it fun ?
look at that !
we all do it !
okay , i &apos;m stopping now .

you know , if it &apos;s not a headboard , it &apos;s just not worth it .
how &apos;s my bing @-@ a @-@ ling ?
i don &apos;t know .
you tell me .
anything you want to tell me ?
because if you .... you should
you would tell me .
why are your eyes so wide ?
you tell me .
maybe it &apos;s because i was just fooling around with my ex .
oh , no . that was you !
oh , my god !
all right !
how did you know ?
joey told me . he saw you two kissing .
in the park ?
no . in his office . how many kisses were there ?
just those two !

why was there kissing ? there should be no kissing !
oh , i &apos;m sorry , honey . i &apos;m so , so ....
i &apos;m so , so sorry . i just ....
what happened was l .... i can &apos;t breathe .
can you get me a bag or something ?
here . here .
it &apos;s the receipt .
i &apos;ll take it .
look , i &apos;ve got to know .
are you finished with me ?
are you finished with him ?
do you still love him ?
do you still love me ?
all right , look ...
... i &apos;m gonna need an actual answer here , okay ?
so which is it ?
him or me ?
i don &apos;t know .
okay , if you &apos;re alive , you answer your phone !
okay , ben , i won &apos;t tell your daddy that you had ice cream before dinner ...
... if you won &apos;t tell him about our little bonking incident .
number one , i don &apos;t think ben understands the concept of bribery .
and number two , i
what ?
you said &quot; number two . &quot;
i also said &quot; number one . &quot;
i know .
hey , everyone !
how &apos;s my little boy ?
he &apos;s perfect . aren &apos;t you , ben ?
he &apos;s never been better .
what did you do , take him whaling ?
monica .
oh , my god ! he just said your name ! that &apos;s great ! good job , ben !
monica bang !
that &apos;s right .
that &apos;s what i &apos;d sound like if i exploded .
the curse is broken ! i called everybody i know ...
... and everyone is alive !
ugly naked guy looks awfully still .
my god , i killed another one !
the curse is getting stronger too , to bring down something that big .
maybe he &apos;s just taking a nap .
i &apos;m telling you , he hasn &apos;t moved since this morning .
we should call somebody .
tell them the naked guy we stare at isn &apos;t moving ?
we &apos;ve got to find out if he &apos;s alive .
how are we gonna do that ? there &apos;s no way .
well , there is one way .
his window &apos;s open . i say ...
... we poke him .
you know how we save all those chopsticks ...
... for no reason when we get chinese food ?
well , now we got a reason .
what ?
we &apos;re fashioning a very long poking device .
all right .
hey , what &apos;s the matter ?
i talked to janice .
oh , my god . is she going back to him ?
she doesn &apos;t know .
says she loves us both .
i woke up this morning , i was in love .
i was happy !
it serves me right for buying that 12 @-@ pack of condoms .
and now i can &apos;t even return them , because she choked on the receipt !
what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
you know ? what would you do ?
it doesn &apos;t matter what i &apos;d do .
come on . come on . tell me .
all right ...
... you probably won &apos;t want to hear this ...
... but if it was me , and this is just me ...
... i &apos;d bow out .
what ?
what are you talking about ?
they have a kid together ...
... you know ?
they &apos;re , like , a family .
and if , i don &apos;t know ...
... if there &apos;s a chance they can make that work ...
... i wouldn &apos;t want to be the guy who stood in the way .
you okay ?
you wanna come poke a nude guy ?
well , he &apos;s finally asleep .
about that bump on his head ....
are you sure it &apos;s a new bump ?
no offense , but i &apos;ve always thought of ben as a fairly bumpy @-@ headed child .
it &apos;s okay if he bumps his head . kids bump their heads all the time .
it was your first time babysitting . you did your best .
i did !
i know .
you just have to watch them all the time .
i did ! i watched ! i watched !
i watched monica bang his head against that thing !
monica did it ?
did you notice anything weird about ben today ?
no , why ?
i was just playing with him , and we were doing the &quot; alphabet song ... &quot;
... which he &apos;s good at . but he left out &quot; e &quot; and &quot; f. &quot;
it &apos;s like they just , i don &apos;t know , fell out of his head .
really ?
oh , and also , he &apos;s walking ...
... kind of funny .
it &apos;s like his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg .
yeah , he &apos;s in there , just ....
oh , my god ! i wrecked your baby !
i hope it &apos;s still funny when you &apos;re in hell .
you jerk !
you know how much i love that kid !
monica bang ! monica bang !
i &apos;ll get the hat .
i have something to tell you .
and i want you to let me get through it ...
... because ...
... it &apos;s not gonna be easy .
i think you should go back with gary .
i don &apos;t want to be the guy that breaks up a family .
you know , when my parents split up , it was because of that guy .
whenever i &apos;d see him , i &apos;d always think ...
... &quot; you &apos;re the reason . you are why they &apos;re not together . &quot;
and i hated that guy .
and it didn &apos;t matter how nice he was or how happy he made my dad .
it &apos;s the right thing to do .
you &apos;re right .
oh , god . but before i can say goodbye ...
... there &apos;s something i really need you to know .
the way i feel about you ...
... it &apos;s like i finally understand ...
... what lionel ritchie &apos;s been singing about .
you know ? i mean , what we have ...
... it &apos;s like movie love .
you &apos;re my soul mate .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re not gonna spend the rest of our lives together .
then don &apos;t leave me .
what ?
forget what i said ! i was babbling ! pick me !
no , you were right ! i gotta give my marriage another chance .
no , you don &apos;t !
i say you have to give your divorce another chance !
sweetie , you should not have to settle for just half my heart .
l &apos;ll settle for half your heart.l &apos;ll settle for a quarter .
l &apos;ll settle for a little , tiny--a ventricle .
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t go .
no , i gotta go .
honey . honey .
people are looking .
i don &apos;t care .
i don &apos;t care !
yeah , okay .
i &apos;m leaving now .
you can &apos;t leave ! i have your shoe !
goodbye , chandler bing .
rachel has those in burgundy .
remember , something this big and long will be very difficult to maneuver .
fortunately , i have experience in that area .
what are you , 1.2 today ?
can we please focus here ? a naked man &apos;s life hangs in the balance .
i &apos;m telling you , he &apos;s dead .
what we &apos;re about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick !
all right , ladies and gentlemen , let &apos;s poke .
steady .
steady .
okay , a little higher .
careful of the angle .
okay , okay . we &apos;re approaching the window .
thread the needle . thread the needle .
he &apos;s alive ! he &apos;s alive !
and yet we &apos;re still poking him .
okay , retract the device ! retract the device !
he does not look happy .
now he &apos;s showing us his poking device .
hey , that &apos;s never gonna make it all the way over here , buddy !
i &apos;ll hold you close in my arms
i can &apos;t resist your charms
and love
love
i &apos;ll be a fool for you
i &apos;m sure
you know i don &apos;t mind
oh , you know i don &apos;t mind
yes
you mean the world to me
oh , i know i know
i &apos;ve found i &apos;ve found
in you
my endless love
