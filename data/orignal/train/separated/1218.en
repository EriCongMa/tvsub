If Holbrook's helping Alison,
then she probably convinced him that she's the victim.
Alison, please!
I want you to meet somebody.
Talia Sandoval, Emily Fields.
Your mom told my mom that I could rent your guesthouse.
I'm Jonny Raymond.
I can't vouch for the egg salad,
but the peanut butter cookie, four stars.
Listen to this! Don't you understand you're making it worse?
There are things that I can't know about--
Surprise, surprise.
Who do you think it was? Holbrook?
I can write a better letter.
Talmadge recently hired Jackie Molina
as an admissions officer.
As in your ex Jackie, who hates my guts?
Jackie read it. It worked.
What are you gonna tell us Ezra?
跟一个年纪比我大的人纠缠不清
Toby was on a search at Mona's property,
and found a bloody knife.
Where's the knife? Is it in there?
Wait. So the knife you and Caleb found was covered in blood?
What, Mona's blood?
Yeah, and any of our prints could have been on it.
Thank God you got rid of it.
Do we think Holbrook planted it?
Well, you vouched for him.
You still think he's a good guy?
I'm not so sure anymore.
I bailed on my college visit
to go track down Holbrook's dad.
And that whole family emergency thing is a lie.
I mean, Holbrook could still be around.
He could have planted it.
You should have called us last night, Hanna.
As soon as you got home.
Well, it was late.
Wait a second.
So if Alison's "A" and Holbrook's on her side,
they could pin Mona's murder on us, couldn't they?
I don't know. I have to get home.
Em, do you want me to drop that off in the mail on my way?
I'm good. I'll go later.
If it's something you're having trouble letting go of,
we can do it for you.
This is not holding on.
This is strictly here's your stuff. I promise.
I found, like, three pairs of her swim goggles,
and some of her CDs in my car.
Are you still going for spring break?
I thought that Paige asked for some space.
She did, so I'm not.
My shift's about to start.
I'm out, too.
Cute shirt, by the way.
Have I borrowed that?
Probably not.
Well, maybe I should.
Can I get a refill? I didn't sleep last night.
Aria, I was here all night.
Holbrook didn't come to the party.
There's no way he could have left you that bookmark.
All right, well, somebody did.
And I've really got to find another college to apply to
before Ezra finds out how I got into Talmadge.
How much?
Just take it.
No, I've already lied to Ezra.
I don't want to steal, too.
Even if it is just a cup of coffee.
Okay, then. Fifty cents.
Since when?
New brew, new prices.
Here.
New register. What's going on?
What?
Aria, this is the letter you wrote to Jackie.
Make it stop.
I'm trying.
What does it say?
"This kind of lie will stay on your permanent record. A."
Hanna? Is that you?
Yeah.
You're home.
Oh, hey, Ted. How was Peru?
Good.
Put a new roof on a chapel,
built a playground for our sponsor school,
dreamed about your mother's waffles.
You know they eat guinea pigs?
Hmm. Wacky.
You didn't hear me come home last night?
Didn't hear me call either.
Tried to warn you I was coming back early.
I had a long week at work.
Must have slept like a rock last night.
Waffles are done.
Looks like it's a nice day out.
Do you want to eat on the patio?
Yeah, sure.
So why did you come back early?
I thought the college had events planned for Saturday and Sunday.
I had a migraine.
Why were you gone when I woke up this morning?
Ted wanted to come over for breakfast.
I was getting syrup.
So you weren't avoiding me?
No, I was under the impression you would be gone all weekend.
You left because of a headache?
Wait, are you mad that I bailed
or that I walked in on your wild college weekend?
Look, whatever you think you saw--
Mom, I know what I saw.
And I just don't understand why.
Could we just talk about it?
Hanna, take this orange juice outside, please.
Mom.
Orange juice, Hanna. Please.
Careful. Cup's hot.
Nice foam, but if you start at the top
and work your way down at the bottom.
I'm pretty sure I can figure it out.
Thanks, though.
I'm in your territory.
I'll just give you your space.
Is everything okay with you two?
Yeah.
Just... defining job duties.
Do you want me to say anything?
No. It's okay, we'll work it out.
Hey. Can we--
I'm so sorry, this is the contractor.
I've been trying to get a hold of him all day.
I'll be right back.
It's because you disappeared for three days on another job.
And I'll tell you what.
When you get back to me,
it better be with a refund check.
I'm sorry.
You know the shelves that I put in with Mike?
This guy is trying to charge me for the installation.
Sorry, can I do something to help?
No, no, it's all right.
Um. Look, Ezra--
Oh, did you have fun last night?
I think Bob Milsom really liked you.
And I know that he could speak on your behalf
to the admission staff at Vassar.
It's one phone call.
Yeah, yeah, that would be great--
I'm so sorry.
This joker. I have to take this.
Hello?
Oh, you can't find the copy of the invoice.
Why don't I send you mine?
Aren't you gonna open them?
I don't need to open them. I already know what they say.
Three acceptance letters.
You don't seem excited.
Come on, the University of Hawaii.
Listen, I know I shouldn't have stormed off like that last night...
This is not about you storming off, okay?
This is about me needing to put zinc on my nose
for the next four years,
and people wearing flip-flops to class.
A lot of people would love to go to school in Hawaii.
Well, I love Brick and Ivy and
wool pea coats.
I don't even want to go to these schools.
I just applied to them because they're far away from here.
But you applied to schools you don't want to go to?
Just to get far away from Rosewood?
After what happened with Mona,
we all decided that it would be smart
to get as far away from Alison as possible.
God, how is she still deciding where I go and what I do?
She's behind bars,
and I still cannot get far enough away from her.
New Mexico? Montana?
Let's say that I do go to the University of Hawaii.
She'll be here. In jail.
Right.
And she was able to plant a murder weapon
in Mona's backyard for you to find.
You didn't think she can book a plane ticket?
We don't know--
Look, you don't know, okay?
We are pretty sure that she has help.
Well, none of us will ever know that for sure, will we?
Hey, Jonny.
Hi.
I'm a little early.
That's fine. Keys?
And here's deposit, first and last.
A lot of it, not all of it,
it's mostly fives and ones.
I'll make sure that my mom gets this.
Toby, this is Jonny, this is Toby.
Jonny's gonna be living in the barn.
Welcome to the neighborhood.
I should probably get going to work.
Yeah. Bye.
Thanks.
So. Your boyfriend's a cop?
Yeah, he wasn't always.
Em, come here.
I just got a message.
"Stop looking for me. I'm tired of hiding.
Grille at noon. H." As in Holbrook?
You are not meeting him by yourself.
Why? It's in the middle of town in the middle of the day.
And I don't think this is an "A" trap.
I can handle this alone.
The least I can do is just hear him out.
If Holbrook's tired of dishing out Alison's revenge,
I might not have to tell Ezra about that letter.
Here we go.
Hammer.
Let me know if you need anything else.
Cool.
Where's your garbage?
Right there.
Are you transferring?
'Cause Hollis is kind of on the opposite side of town.
That's good to know, but I'm not.
I mean, I might.
I haven't decided yet.
I've been traveling, mostly.
I can make you a sandwich.
That'd be great.
No ham, though.
Ham's got a sketchy texture.
I'm not grocery shopping. These are art supplies.
For color. Coffee grounds. Score.
Do you make your own paint?
When I need to.
Especially after a deposit first and last months' rent.
Were you in Italy?
About a month. How did you...
We studied the Renaissance,
and I did a project on Botticelli.
So I made my own tempera paints from scratch.
I'd love to hear about your trip.
I've always wanted to go to Italy.
I'll make you a deal.
I'll give you a travelogue if you let me borrow an egg.
Yeah, deal.
I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna need to-- to go.
I'll get you the egg later.
Sure. I'll see ya.
10:48 激活
Yeah, Aria got the same text.
We're at Caleb's, we're trying to figure it out.
Okay, Em, I'll call you when we're done.
All right, so obviously ghosts don't have fingers.
So how was Mona sending us texts?
Not a ghost. An alert.
Sent automatically by a security company.
Mona put some kind of LoJack on her laptop before she died.
Someone must have gotten through the encryption, set off an alarm.
Yeah, there were a bunch of numbers.
GPS coordinates.
Probably the location where the laptop was used.
Looks like it's a storage place off of the turnpike.
It's still there.
I logged in to the security company's website.
So that blinky thing,
that's where Ali hid Mona's laptop?
Could Mona have set this up to alert the police?
It's an option, but she didn't.
She sent it to the four of you.
And usually, Mona's security is incredibly tight,
but it's almost like she purposely
made it easy for me to log in.
So we could get her laptop back if Ali took it?
Or so we could track down whoever took the laptop
without them knowing that we were coming.
Do you guys think this is where Holbrook is hiding?
Well, Aria's gonna text us when she's at the Grille.
If Holbrook's with her,
then that gives us time to go and look around.
That was fast.
Who's driving?
Hold your horses, it's for me.
Hey, Ted.
Yeah, yeah, I'll meet you there.
Pastor back?
Yeah, this morning. I have to go meet him.
That's Aria.
Do you want us to drop you off?
No. I'll go by myself.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Oh, and if you see anything suspicious,
don't pick it up.
Please don't let him pick anything up.
And what's that thing they say about rats in the corner?
A cornered rat will bite?
Yes.
Remember, Holbrook's a rat.
Aria.
Jason.
Are you meeting someone?
Yeah.
Yeah, I am, but I don't think they're gonna show up.
How are you? Since--
Since I basically put my sister in prison?
Well, we can start at tense and work our way on from there.
How is she?
She's tried to call us a few times, but--
You don't have to explain.
I went to see her once.
That was enough.
Do you want to grab a bite?
I was supposed to meet Ashley,
Hanna's mom, for a working lunch,
but she just canceled.
It might actually might be nice to talk about Alison.
Yeah. Yeah, it might.
Oh, there's stuff in the kitchen, if you want to clean.
I can show you.
I know. In the supply closet.
I'm just gonna go and put this with the rest.
Oh, that's not usually where we keep that stuff.
Listen, I just had some down-time,
and I don't do well with idle hands.
If there's some things you think we should change, then great.
Just bring it up before you decide on your own.
Deal?
Deal.
I actually did want to ask,
do you think Ezra would go for a new uniform?
Uniform?
Yeah, nothing fancy.
Just a polo with the logo.
You know, something casual, and cohesive.
Just a little...
neater.
Neater than what?
Well, I was just noticing earlier
that there's a little hole in the shoulder of your shirt.
And so I started thinking that maybe--
It's a T-shirt. It's comfortable.
Yeah, just maybe something a little darker,
so that the stains don't show.
Okay, maybe one new idea at a time.
I've got some bolt cutters in my car.
I like to be prepared.
They won't work on that. It's a shrouded lock.
Hard to cut, even harder to pick.
Spencer?
Mrs. Horowitz.
You look familiar.
Did you transfer out of my third period last semester?
No, I wasn't in your class.
Probably just saw me in the halls.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I'll be right back.
My friend just got an apartment.
And so we're just getting some things
out of storage for him.
Are you here often?
Every month or so. Why?
Well, I guess this really isn't the kind of place
where you get to know your neighbors.
You're talking about 1017, aren't you?
That smell, am I right?
Smell?
Oh, yeah, there's some sort of an odor.
It wafts down the hallway sometimes.
I think it's coming from that unit.
Have you ever spoken to the renter?
About a month or so, there was a girl, blonde.
Hey, if it starts to smell again,
you think you could say something to the manager?
Sure, yeah.
What does the blonde girl look like?
Just in case I spot her.
I tried to stop her, but she was in a hurry.
I didn't get to see her face.
Not that management would care anyway.
They ought to do something about it.
It's really unsanitary.
Yeah, absolutely.
Bye, Mrs. Horowitz.
See you in school.
Is she coming back?
No, I don't think so.
Where did you go?
I made a shim out of your teacher's soda can.
We're gonna use it to pick the lock.
I thought you said that you can't pick that lock.
Not that lock.
Her lock.
Forget about the alibi.
Does your dad really believe her?
Doesn't matter.
I mean, he only knows how to protect her.
He'll do the same thing on the witness stand,
even if he knows what she's capable of.
What do you think she's capable of?
A lot.
I've seen her do things.
I've seen her talk people into things.
I mean, the way you girls used to follow her around--
Used to.
I know you're not on the best of terms, but ...
the police have a theory.
They think she had help.
With Mona?
After.
Putting Mona's body in the trunk of her car,
hiding it or dumping it.
Yeah, we kind of think the same thing.
Do you remember when she passed that lie detector test?
Someone on the inside,
who could change the results, make sure she passed.
Is there anything you noticed between Alison and Holbrook?
I've only dealt with him a few times.
Not that I would have noticed.
She can get away with things right under your nose.
Yeah, well, we think that they might be close.
That she talked him into doing things.
God, what is it with cops in this town?
一个小时 梅普和普莱斯考特 汉娜
So you think that is possible?
I can't say for sure.
But Ali's probably cut him loose by now.
What else can he do for her?
Babe, you sound really echo-y.
Like you're in an air duct.
That's because I'm in an air duct.
Ted's waiting for me.
Just call me if you find anything.
Okay.
Let's sit down.
So...
I want to talk to you about your mother.
I'm pretty sure that you should
probably talk to her about this.
She knows that I know.
But how do you know?
Because I know.
But I haven't asked you yet.
Wait, asked me what?
For your permission.
Hanna,
I'd like to marry your mother.
Well, I still think that you should
probably talk to her about this.
I really would like for you, me, and
and your mom to be a family.
And if we're going to be a family,
I want to make sure you're all in.
When?
Tonight.
Over dinner at the house, and I want you to be there.
Tonight?
Yeah, definitely, I'm totally in.
Is it gonna be like a fancy dinner or?
Super-casual. Like any other night.
I want her to be surprised.
Don't worry. My lips are sealed.
Thanks.
Hey, Mom.
Call me back when you get this.
I really need to talk to you.
It's a flower shop.
What's a flower shop?
Where I'm meeting Holbrook.
He must've seen me talking to Jason and gotten spooked.
He wants to meet me alone.
If he's really crossing Ali,
I guess he wouldn't want it getting back to her.
Just... check in, okay?
Yeah, I will.
Your T-shirt was a gift?
What?
From the ex?
You got defensive
when I pointed out the hole in your shirt.
It's not a big deal.
It is, and I'm sorry.
You know, when someone's important to you,
it can be hard to let go.
There's this dish and it's a beef stew.
It's called ropa vieja.
It literally means "old clothes."
It's just one of those old recipes that
comes from a hundred different places,
and everybody makes it the same way,
over and over.
You know, every once in a while,
you got to add some yellow peppers, green olives,
you know, flavor, color.
And then the same old thing can feel brand-new.
I don't know if I'm ready to feel brand-new.
Well, how can you when you're carrying
your old relationship around on your back?
Yeah.
You got it?
Yeah.
That's Mona's computer.
No, don't touch anything.
It's really neat in here, it's too neat.
Everything's bagged.
It's clear plastic. It looks like evidence.
Holbrook?
There's so much blood on these clothes.
Do you think this is what Mona was wearing when she died?
Why's he keeping them?
Maybe the more important question is,
is this where he kept the knife until he planted it?
He's keeping it to build a case...
against one of us.
Get down.
There's someone else in here, behind the shelves.
Wait.
Wait here.
Don't.
It's just an empty suit.
And a barrel.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
That she's in there?
It sounds full.
And Mona wasn't very big.
Okay. Mona was a lot of things, but ...
she didn't deserve this.
Denatured alcohol. Antacid tablets.
Water.
Okay, I didn't take chemistry.
It's biology.
When you mix those together in the right proportion,
you can preserve a specimen--
a frog, a pig fetus, any vertebrate, really.
And what if you mix them wrong?
It's corrosive.
You turn whatever specimen you have to sludge.
So she's either being pickled or dissolved?
Did you really just say that?
Sorry.
Should we open it?
Aria?
Here to pick up, right?
No, I'm just...
A guy called, said you'd pick up and hand deliver.
Was his name...
I'm here by myself.
Delivery address is 34 Turning Leaf Lane.
The cross streets.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know where that is. Thank you.
Okay.
加州 帕罗奥图市
Where have you been? I need to talk to you.
We're not gonna talk about that.
That is the least of your problems.
I called, I texted.
Relax, Hanna. I was not doing that.
That is none of your business.
Yes, it is. And it's kind of Ted's business, too.
God, Jason? Why?
Aren't you, like, working for him now?
Are you gonna lose your job over this?
Jason and I... it was nothing.
It wasn't nothing.
Mom, he's Alison's brother.
I am aware of that, and it's not something
I'm comfortable with either.
What is going on?
I mean, you love Ted, right?
Because he really loves you and he's...
He's what, Hanna?
He's just a really good guy,
and I like him.
And I like him with you.
And I don't want anything to ruin that.
Are you going to tell him?
That is for me to decide,
not you.
You sure you wiped down everything?
Only things I touched were the light switch
and the air duct covers.
I think we're good.
What if we left hair?
Fiber? Skin cells?
I think you're being paranoid.
Possibly, if I were being excessively or unreasonably anxious,
according to Merriam-Webster,
but there is nothing unreasonable or excessive
about wanting to keep us all out of jail.
I'm being meticulous.
Actually, you're being a thesaurus,
but I appreciate your attention to detail.
Done. Security footage is wiped.
No sign that we were ever there.
And no sign of that blonde or Holbrook.
We need to figure out a way to tie Holbrook
into that storage space
without getting tied up into it ourselves.
We could always call Toby.
Tip him off.
Let the cops find out what was in that barrel.
Opening that barrel would have just been
playing into Holbrook's hands.
Besides, I really don't want to risk Toby's job.
When we have proof that
that's where Holbrook does Ali's dirty work,
then we'll have something to turn in.
What about the lease?
Could you maybe get into their records?
Find a renter's agreement with a name?
Yeah, shouldn't take long.
Okay.
I really should have gone after that knife on my own.
If it makes you feel any better,
Toby's not really talking to me either.
He's talking to me, there's just...
not really much to say.
What's the big secret?
Hey, is your mom here?
I was supposed to deliver these to her,
but I think that something's up.
Hanna? Who's at the door?
It's Aria.
Tell her we're still eating, please.
Yeah. Just one second. Go upstairs.
Honey,
whatever it is, make it quick, okay?
Yeah. No. It's just a school thing.
I'll be down in a couple minutes, I promise.
"Last night took me by surprise.
Glad I stayed for dessert. Jason."
Wait, what?
Since when does your mom bake?
And why was Jason...
This isn't Jason.
This is Alison trying to start trouble.
Why? What do you and your mom have to do with Jason?
Forget about Jason. I did this.
Okay, I went to see her in jail.
I'm sorry. You did what?
I had to.
I thought she was going after Caleb.
When I heard about that bloody knife--
We agreed, Hanna, none of us were supposed to.
I spent the whole day
running on her hamster wheel because of you.
Well, I faced her for all of us.
And I told her to back off. This is her, backing off.
You should have told us.
I'll tell the others, okay? I promise.
Just don't mention the flowers, please.
Fine.
For a town where some pretty awful things have happened,
today, almost nothing happened.
Come on, something must have happened.
I responded to a total of two calls.
An 11-26 and a 10-91L.
So Rosewood is now safe from an abandoned bicycle
and an off-leash labradoodle.
We haven't done this in a while.
I've missed it.
Yeah, me too.
You know, we haven't talked about this college,
the distance. Maybe we should.
We've been apart before.
Yeah, but surfboard or Bricks and Ivy,
you're gonna be gone.
I don't want to hold you back,
but I also can't get used to the thought
of you being an ocean away.
Then maybe you can come with me.
You can learn how to surf.
It's really chilly. I'll close the window.
"Found something. Call me."
What did you and Caleb find?
What did you and Caleb find?
I can't tell you.
This isn't about telling.
This is about not doing things that will get you both,
all of us, in a lot of trouble.
So whatever you did today, that's it.
I want it to stop.
Whatever you say, officer.
Clean the dishes please, Hanna.
Sure.
I've got dessert.
All right, here we go.
Do we all get a cookie, Ted, or...
It's not just any cookie. It's a peanut butter cookie.
We shared one of these the first day we met.
And I was thinking,
maybe we could share one of these tonight.
Ted.
Hold on. I've still got a few more formalities to get through.
When I moved to this town,
I knew it would bring tremendous change to my life.
Turns out that change was you.
There's something bigger than both of us
that put you in my path.
And I want to spend the rest of our lives together
being grateful for the gift of you.
Ashley,
will you marry me?
I need a minute to think.
You just took her by surprise, that's all.
She's had a really long stressful week at work,
and you came home early.
Well, either she doesn't like surprises,
or there's something wrong with my timing.
There's nothing wrong with you, Ted.
You did everything right.
You just have to give her a minute to take it all in.
I will.
Thanks, Hanna.
I should've see him out.
He is such a good man.
He deserves the truth.
As soon as this week, i'll have an actual office in the back.
Are you here for your paycheck?
Yeah.
Great.
I think it's over by the register.
Oh, I can just--
Oh, no, no, no. Let me get it.
It's my first payday as boss,
and kind of looking forward to it.
Soda?
Don't like coffee. Love caffeine.
Is this you outside of work?
I may have to rethink that whole uniform idea.
I'm not dressed up or anything.
Just picking up my check.
Casual looks good on you.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Can I ask you something?
It's not work related, I promise.
Okay.
What do you think about that?
It's cute buns on the boss man, right?
Yeah. Yeah. I guess.
Hey, did you need something?
Egg.
What?
Egg.
The cop was here, so I waited.
But you owe me.
An egg. I am sorry. I forgot.
Come in.
Can't really make paint without a binder.
Did I ruin your plans?
I read a bit to pass the time.
Got kind of sucked into the local news.
Anything exciting?
There's nothing but excitement around here.
That body in your backyard is just the tip of the iceberg.
Yeah. Not quite the town you remember, huh?
We left when I was a kid,
but I don't remember anything like this.
Were you really friends with her?
That girl who murdered a classmate?
Yeah, I was. Not so much anymore.
With her in the halls,
I can imagine why you'd date a cop.
Try next-door neighbor.
Trying to get as far away from her as possible?
Earlier, I saw the acceptance letters.
Have you bothered to open them yet?
After everything that's happened,
I really don't know if I can handle anything
as mundane as college.
The iceberg runs deep.
I bailed.
After a semester.
It's just a bunch of kids sitting on bunk beds,
trying to figure out what to do with the rest of their lives.
That sounds like the worst sleep-away camp ever.
So you just quit school and traveled?
I want to study art, and then make it.
Bought a ticket to Europe,
haunted as many museums as I could.
I'd trade a sketch or a canvas for room,
board, a ride to the next town.
There's no rule that says you have to go to college.
If you want to,
you can just...
go.
You need to get that?
No.
So tell me about Italy.
Well, it doesn't actually begin in Italy.
It started in London.
Is your mom up?
I think she cried herself to sleep.
Ted popped the question tonight.
And she cried?
They still haven't figured it out yet.
Wait, have you been with Spencer this whole time?
You didn't even call me back.
Yeah. I got your message.
Listen,
Spencer asked me to look into something,
and it took longer than I thought.
About the storage unit?
I found out the name on the rental agreement.

Hanna, that storage unit is rented in your name,
and I'm pretty sure that Mona's body is hidden inside of it.
