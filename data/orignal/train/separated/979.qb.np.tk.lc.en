desperate housewives s07 e02
that maniac was serving a life sentence .
hello , ladies .
paul young came back .
doug is leaving me .
lynette &apos;s friend had nowhere to go .
i &apos;ve spent eight years loving someone else &apos;s daughter .
a baby was switched long ago ,
and carlos made a decision .
we &apos;re not telling gaby .
susan got a job offer .
women doing housework in lingerie .
while bree &apos;s contractor ...
with your red hair , you will look so hot in this room .
brought possibilities to light .
all set .
now that you &apos;re a biker chick ,
there &apos;s one other thing you gotta know how to do .
thanks , mister .
it had been a long time
since bree van de kamp was a little girl ,
but she could still remember
everything she &apos;d ever been told about sex .
her grandmother informed her it was a woman &apos;s burden .
her minister warned her it was a sin .
her teacher taught her it was unhealthy .
yes , everyone had told bree
her sexual urges were dangerous .
but no one had ever told her ...
how to get rid of them .
hey . there you are .
i &apos;m off to the bank .
before you go , i wanna show you something .
come here . whole new idea .
i wanna panel the study in this .
oh . well , that &apos;s , uh , unusual .
historical birch from a wyoming snow fence .
over 200 years old . feel it .
no . really .
feel it .
you know what they call this ?
witness wood , &apos; cause it &apos;s seen so much history ,
unlike me , who slept through history
and had to go to summer school .
i have to go . it &apos;s late .
yes , when bree was a little girl ,
she &apos;d been taught
her sexual urges were dangerous .
unfortunately , she was about to learn ...
those urges were dangerous ... for everyone .
juanita .
the doctors and nurses at fairview hospital
are experts at healing .
they can set bones ...
bandage wounds ...
and treat diseases .
sadly , one thing they don &apos;t know how to heal
is a guilty conscience .
i don &apos;t know what happened . she just came out of nowhere .
oh , honey , this could &apos;ve been any of us .
kids on that street always playing where they shouldn &apos;t be .
still , i would just feel better if they would come out
and tell us something .
juanita was talking when they put her in the ambulance ,
so i &apos;m sure everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
and i just spoke to one of the nurses .
she seemed pretty positive .
well , that &apos;s a relief .
paul ?
w @-@ what are you doing here ?
i heard about the accident , so i @-@ i rushed right over .
that &apos;s what neighbors do , right ?
well , that &apos;s very thoughtful .
we &apos;ll tell gaby you stopped by .
yeah , don &apos;t feel like you have to hang around .
there &apos;s nothing we can do .
we can pray .
dear lord , we ask that you be with this young child
and with the doctors caring for her ...
and that she may be returned in full health
to loving family . amen .
amen .
well , i have to get home . i &apos;m expecting someone .
please extend my good wishes to gaby .
dear lord , please don &apos;t let that creep ever touch me again .
amen .
oh , gaby , thank god .
how is juanita ?
she &apos;s gonna be fine .
they &apos;re keeping her a couple days for observation .
so i told carlos he doesn &apos;t even have to
fly back from his business trip .
that &apos;s great news .
yeah , it is .
uh , bree , andrew , can i talk to you for a second ?
thanks for coming .
i feel so blessed to have such wonderful ...
what the hell is wrong with you people ? !
first you take out my mother @-@ in @-@ law ,
then you go after my daughter .
are you trying to kill off every juanita solis on the planet ? !
i admit it was a terrible coincidence .
you &apos;re gettin &apos; sloppy , you know .
this one was in broad daylight .
i &apos;m sorry .
she just came out of nowhere .
have you seen my daughter ?
she never comes out of nowhere .
uh , on a related note , i just wanna say
how much i appreciate you
not telling carlos about me running over his mom .
i &apos;m gonna give you that one &apos; cause i wasn &apos;t fond of her .
but as for the rest of my family , learn to swerve !
why does this keep happening ?
i don &apos;t know . i mean , maybe god &apos;s punishing us .
or god is punishing the solises ,
and we &apos;re just doing god &apos;s work .
i feel awful .
i should never have been fiddling with that radio .
radio ? mom , i saw you from across the street .
you were checking out keith &apos;s ass .
that &apos;s preposterous .
you were looking at that contractor &apos;s butt
like you were waiting for a side of steak sauce .
watch your mouth .
this isn &apos;t one of your homosexual dance clubs .
i &apos;m telling you , it was the radio .
okay . fine . but while we &apos;re talking about the radio ,
uh , you do know that that particular model is ,
like , 15 years too young for you , right ?
who is it ?
maxine .
oh , uh , hang on a second .
ah , i was just wrapping up my first session .
i know . i was watching .
and ?
what &apos;d you think ?
it was like watching a dream .
and you know why ? &apos; cause i was asleep .
sit down , honey .
it &apos;s time i gave you a few pointers .
now ... you see what i &apos;m doing here ?
and let &apos;s not forget the duster .
okay . okay , i @-@ i get it .
and what have we here ? smudges .
uh , we eat off that table .
am i making my point ?
we are selling a fantasy here .
you gotta , you know , loosen up .
i want to . i just ...
i can &apos;t stop thinking about all those men out there
watching me .
yes , they &apos;re watching you .
they are spending their hard @-@ earned dollars
to see the perfect woman .
you , my darling ,
have all the power here .
now ...
is that a crumb i see on that rug ?
that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s my girl .
doug , if your lawyers don &apos;t sweeten the settlement offer ,
i will sue you for half of everything ,
and that includes your girlfriend &apos;s new implants .
you paid for &apos; em out of our joint account ,
so technically , one of those puppies is mine .
oh , i don &apos;t know .
maybe throw it in the pool and use it as a floatie .
uh , renee .
oh , she &apos;s gonna be dating soon enough .
it &apos;s time she learned what men are all about .
now , sweetie ,
what did auntie renee teach you about marriage ?
never sign a prenup .
oh ! jeez !
how are you doing home from work ?
i &apos;m not feeling well .
again ?
yeah .
that &apos;s the third time this week .
you need to go to the doctor .
no , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m just gonna lie on the couch and watch some tv .
okay .
before you fire up the golf channel ,
you think maybe you &apos;d make a quick run to grocery store ?
i &apos;m tired . can &apos;t you do it ?
i &apos;m a little busy right now .
i &apos;ve got five kids and a useless house guest .
hi there .
i need you functional .
either go to the doctor and get some help
or quit complaining and give me some help .
fine . i &apos;ll go tomorrow .
man , the sympathy in here is just overwhelming .
what ?
nothing . it &apos;s none of my business .
but ...
you may wanna be careful .
you two are starting to sound a lot like me and doug .
i appreciate the concern , but tom and i always do that .
doug and i always did that , too .
look at us now .
i &apos;m telling you , we &apos;re fine .
if you say so .
good .
the doctors say she &apos;s gonna be fine .
they &apos;re only keeping her in the hospital as a precaution .
she &apos;ll be home in a few days .
oh , thank god .
well , look , he &apos;s here .
can we please not have another ugly scene ?
i only came to check on juanita .
she &apos;s fine .
fantastic .
so i see you let our tomato plants whither ...
just like you did our relationship .
that &apos;s what happens when you grow needy , whiny tomatoes .
boys , boys , it &apos;s been a month .
can &apos;t you just kiss each other &apos;s bottoms and make up ?
isn &apos;t that what they do ?
who is that ?
she looks lost .
should we help her ?
aah ! son of a bitch !
we should help her .
son of a ...
oh ! oh !
miss , is everything okay ?
no .
i am so lost .
i gave the cab driver the address ,
but i only had a $ 20 , and it turns out
that only gets you as far as hibiscus circle ,
so he dumped me ,
and i had to walk in these shoes , which broke ,
and that is the last time i am buying footwear over the internet .
uh , were you looking for wisteria lane ?
yeah , that sounds right .
is my fish moving ?
if he goes belly @-@ up , this is going to be the worst day ever .
who is it you &apos;re here to see ?
uh , paul young .
really ? are you a friend of his ?
w @-@ well ...
beth !
oh ! i thought you were gonna be here hours ago .
well ... i see you &apos;ve all met my wife .
sorry , it got ... really hot in here ,
and i thought you &apos;d be gone for a while .
so how is juanita ? is she okay ?
um , she &apos;s doing much better .
thank you for asking .
thank god . how are you doing ?
um , me ? i &apos;m okay .
how &apos;s the work coming ?
pretty good .
just getting ready to put , uh ...
shoot . it &apos;s on backwards .
bree ?
you sure you &apos;re okay ?
i &apos;m fine . fine .
it &apos;s just been a very ... stressful day .
i think i know what you need .
it &apos;s okay .
hitting that little girl was an accident .
it could &apos;ve happened to anyone .
i have to let you go !
huh ?
after you let me go . everyone should just let go !
are you firing me ?
why ?
you &apos;re too messy .
your tools-- they &apos;re scattered everywhere .
well , this is a construction site .
and you &apos;re getting paint all over the place .
and that cologne of yours-- it &apos;s overpowering .
i don &apos;t wear cologne .
that &apos;s just you ?
oh , dear .
anyway , obviously ...
i will pay you for the time you &apos;ve put in ,
but i think you should go .
you can ... send me a check .
bye , guys .
have a great day .
hey , aren &apos;t you going to work ?
oh , my first class isn &apos;t till 11 : 00 .
i thought i &apos;d spend the morning making more jewelry .
wow , you really are determined to bring in some extra money .
you have no i dea .
and you don &apos;t let me put my feet on that table .
mike ! uh , what are you--what are you doing home so quick ?
i forgot my thermos . what are you wearing ?
uh ...
uh , i was , uh , just-- just doing housework ...
o @-@ obviously ,
and , uh , the air conditioning isn &apos;t working ,
so it got really hot in here .
i &apos;ll say .
mind if i join you ?
no ! no ! uh ...
oh !
uh ... you know what ?
why don &apos;t we take this in the bedroom ?
what &apos;s wrong with right here ?
i am one lucky guy ...
to come home to a hot fantasy like this .
yep . and i am one lucky girl
to have a ... have a husband like ... you . ohh .
any luck finding an apartment ?
not with my settlement .
with new york prices ,
i &apos;ll be forced to live in a place smaller than this .
oh , my god . how will you keep from bumping into yourself ?
you know what i was thinking ?
why don &apos;t i just find a place here in fairview ?
fairview ?
uh ... no .
no , no !
you &apos;re a new yorker .
you love the theater , museums .
you said yourself ,
you can &apos;t even get a decent cup of coffee around here .
uh , no , i meant here , lynette .
really , how hard is it to clean the pot ?
hey ! how &apos;d it go with the doctor ?
yeah , can , uh , we , um ...
talk about that ?
so what did the doctor say ?
you &apos;re gonna wanna sit down .
tom , you are scaring me . what is it ?
i have postpartum depression .
come again ?
i know it sounds weird , b @-@ but it &apos;s--it &apos;s--
it &apos;s a recognized problem for fathers my age .
i &apos;ve got all the classic symptoms--
headaches , mood swings ,
fatigue .
tell me , did he check you for
a yeast infection while heads down there , too ?
why don &apos;t you learn the facts before you make fun of it ?
&quot; men and postpartum :
the bitter seed . &quot;
yeah , i &apos;m ... not buying it .
show me one stretch mark , one chapped nipple ,
and we &apos;ll talk about your postpartum .
it &apos;s a legitimate medical condition .
and you &apos;re the one who told me to go to the doctor .
so you could be of some use around here ,
not so you could , uh ...
oh , &quot; take long baths or get in some extra naps &quot; ?
do me a favor . read the whole pamphlet .
gosh , i wish i could , tom .
unfortunately , i have to go take care of my other baby .
i love the house .
oh . well , i did the best i could .
i think it needs a woman &apos;s touch .
i @-@ i don &apos;t have much experience with decorating .
if i so much as moved a chair , mama would throw a fit .
then you must be happy to finally have your own home .
i guess .
look at this--
no plexiglas .
i never dreamed the day would come
when i could reach out and touch you .
i didn &apos;t either .
there is one thing i &apos;ll miss about prison--
your letters .
some days , they were the only things keeping me going .
i &apos;m glad you liked them .
uh , thank you again for going to so much trouble .
dinner is wonderful .
i wanted tonight to be special .
since the prison didn &apos;t allow conjugal visits ,
this is ... kind of our wedding night .
about that ..
i can &apos;t wait to start cooking for you
and making things nice around here ,
but there are certain other ...
wifely duties that i don &apos;t want to rush into .
oh ?
we &apos;re still getting to know each other .
mama said you &apos;d understand .
oh , i suppose i do .
you &apos;re not upset ?
of course not .
there &apos;s more to marriage than sex .
oh , mrs. solis , can i talk to you ?
if this is about juanita and the dessert cart ,
i told you not to leave it unattended .
no , i was reviewing her chart ,
and i realized we still had a couple of questions .
is she allergic to any medications ?
uh , not that i &apos;m aware of .
okay . all her vaccinations up @-@ to @-@ date ?
yes .
and how old was she when you adopted her ?
i know it &apos;s hard to believe
that the little acorn gave birth to the mighty oak ,
but believe me , i did .
okay .
maybe i &apos;m confused , but the other day
when we talked about possible blood transfusions ,
you told me you and your husband were type @-@ o .
yeah , we are .
so ?
well , your daughter is type @-@ a. two o &apos;s can &apos;t have an &quot; a. &quot;
never mind .
oa , whoa , whoa . what ... what was that ?
what was that &quot; oh . never mind &quot; ?
it &apos;s none of my business .
no , no , tell me . what are you implying ?
nothing .
i &apos;m simply stating that the odds of mr. solis being
the biological father of a type @-@ a baby
are roughly ... nil .
are you suggesting i cheated on him ?
i &apos;m simply stating that the odds of mr. solis being
the biological father are
listen , nursie .
i know you spend your days emptying bedpans
and shaving the groins of senior citizens ,
but there &apos;s no drama here .
i &apos;ve been faithful to my husband .
i have nothing to hide .
give me that .
good morning .
good morning .
did you have trouble sleeping ?
ah , i was up kinda late .
boy , that tom sure can talk .
you were up with tom ?
oh . yeah . i guess he had a lot on his mind .
no surprise after the way things went
between you two yesterday .
he was complaining about that ?
oh , i don &apos;t want to get in the middle .
honey , you had a pajama party with my husband
3 : 00 in the morning .
you &apos;re in the middle .
well ...
tom feels that you don &apos;t listen to him .
oy . guy--sure i do .
i heard that whole spiel about male postpartum ,
otherwise known by its initials--b.s.
see , that &apos;s just the thing .
he thinks you hear , but you don &apos;t listen .
okay .
okay , you stop .
i don &apos;t need you troubleshooting my marriage .
and i don &apos;t want you having any more
of these little conversations with my husband .
okay . fine .
and i mean it .
there you are ! i called you an hour ago !
i was at school .
hi , sweetie ! the kids in your class made you a poster .
look what brittany said .
yeah , yeah , yeah . she loves it . come on !
come on !
what is going on ? !
okay .
do you remember eight years ago
when we went on that ski weekend ?
uh ... vaguely .
no , no , no , no , no ! it can &apos;t be &quot; vaguely . &quot;
i need you to focus .
oh ! oh ! okay .
remember how you and i had dinner with that french guy ?
the one you referred to as le package ?
exactly .
okay . tell me everything you remember .
ooh ! i remember i had the fondue and i lost my strawberry ,
and the waiter almost caught me when i put my--
i &apos;m talking about me and the package !
why are you yelling at me ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m mad ! you went off to bed
and left me and frenchie drinking at the hotel bar ,
and friends don &apos;t let friends flirt drunk !
now for the love of god ,
do you at least remember when i came back to the room ?
i remember the sun was coming up .
oh , god .
gaby , you &apos;re not saying ...
yeah .
i think juanita might be french .
when carlos returned from his business trip ,
he stopped at the hospital to visit his daughter ,
who had been sleeping peacefully .
then he came home to see his wife ,
who had been plotting frantically .
oh , you &apos;re awake .
mmm . you &apos;re really awake .
what ...
carlos , what are you doing ? !
me ? i just got into bed ! you climbed on top of me .
i did ?
yeah . you were kinda making out with me
not that i &apos;m complaining .
oh , no . it &apos;s happening again !
what are you talking about ?
my sexsomnia .
your what ?
yeah , it &apos;s like sleepwalking , except ...
instead of using your legs , you use your ... you know .
sexsomnia .
it &apos;s real . look it up .
since when have you had that ?
well , definitely before the girls were born .
i &apos;ve never seen you do it before .
well , it mostly only happens when i &apos;m really tired ,
like when i work out too much
or go skiing .
well , then first thing tomorrow ,
i &apos;m checking out airfare to aspen .
no ! no , no , no . it &apos;s not a joke . it &apos;s dangerous .
it doesn &apos;t matter who i &apos;m next to .
i could have sex and not even know it .
well , since you &apos;re up ...
no , i &apos;m too tired ...
and ashamed . good night .
hey , i thought i &apos;d return this .
i borrowed it from orson a while back .
thank you .
so where &apos;s that chippendale dancer
you hired to fix your house ?
if you mean my contractor , his name is keith ,
and i had to let him go .
why ? you catch him , uh , grating cheese on his abs ?
it just wasn &apos;t working out .
must &apos;ve been pretty bad for you
to kick that shirtless wonder out of your front yard .
i was finally reaching my target heart rate on my walk .
you mean at your age , you still have urges to--
i &apos;m not dead , bree .
i may like my bed and my food soft ,
but i like my men--
okay . okay . just curious .
i guess i was hoping ...
hoping what ?
that one day i might outgrow all this .
ah , that &apos;s why you fired keith .
i just can &apos;t have him around . he &apos;s too distracting .
and i refuse to make a fool of myself .
and how would that happen ?
well , let me run the numbers for you .
my marriage ended six days ago ,
keith is 15 years too young for me ,
and my track record with lovers--
two dead , one in a wheelchair .
bree , i can &apos;t tell you how to live your life .
all i know is that not living your life isn &apos;t the answer .
i &apos;ve just ... never been very good at taking risks .
well , then get good , because take my word for it ,
once they turn into regrets , it &apos;s too late .
don &apos;t feel like you have to help or anything .
cool .
where &apos;s your dad ? his car &apos;s gone .
uh , he and renee went out to dinner .
he and renee ?
yeah . they went to that french restaurant dad likes .
they said you could join them if you want .
oh , i want .
okay , you unload these groceries
and look after your sister .
nah , i &apos;ve got plans tonight .
i don &apos;t want to get stuck babysitting .
cool .
hey . good , you got the message .
loud and clear . so you guys sure look like
you &apos;re discussing something heavy .
what &apos;s up ?
to be honest , i was talking about you ...
and your tendency to be critical ,
and how frustrating it is to have my feelings invalidated
whenever i bring up something you don &apos;t like .
renee , sidebar .
did i or did i not tell you
to butt the hell out of my marriage ?
what did i do ?
i was just finishing my dessert and listening to the guy talk .
&quot; how frustrating it is to have my feelings invalidated &quot; ?
that &apos;s got your $ 500 @-@ an @-@ hour shrink written all over it .
i was just trying to help .
that &apos;s a load of crap .
you need a project , and since you &apos;re currently without
a house to remodel , you &apos;ve decided
to put the wrecking ball to my marriage .
oh , please .
this is what you do .
you take other people &apos;s lives apart
for your own amusement ,
and then you get the fun of putting them back together .
well , i &apos;m not letting you do it this time .
my marriage is not some guest bathroom
in your summer house .
fine . let &apos;s just say that you &apos;re right ,
and i &apos;m a terrible person .
but there &apos;s still a man in there who is in pain ,
and his wife won &apos;t listen to him . that &apos;s not my doing .
i think this sidebar is over .
hey , susan ?
oh , those are beautiful . what &apos;s the occasion ?
i called the bank
to see if they would give us an extension on our car payment ,
and the guy told me you already paid it .
had a good week with my jewelry .
you &apos;re amazing .
you teach ,
you bust your ass with this jewelry business ,
and i come home yesterday ,
and here you are , as happy as can be ,
working to make this place a home .
i &apos;m so lucky to have a wife like you .
wow .
there ya go .
that &apos;s quite a haul .
you know , you &apos;re gettin &apos; good as this .
i didn &apos;t think that was gonna happen .
i &apos;m also getting good at lying to my husband .
i didn &apos;t think that was gonna happen either .
hello , keith .
how &apos;d you find me ?
you follow the scent of my nonexistent cologne ?
no . your answering service said i might find you here .
i was a little out of sorts the other day ,
and , uh , well , long story short ,
i was hoping you &apos;d consider coming back .
i &apos;ve got a buddy , loves sports cars .
i told him to buy an old pontiac g.t.o.
they run great , they &apos;re easy to work on .
but he bought a maserati .
the thing is always in the shop ,
very temperamental ,
real pain in the ass .
you seem like kind of a maserati to me .
i &apos;m no maserati , keith .
i &apos;m a family sedan with a beige interior
who &apos;s going through a divorce .
well , i &apos;m sorry about that ,
but i &apos;m still gonna pass .
i @-@ i need you .
you &apos;ve seen my house . it &apos;s kind of a mess .
and the truth is , my life &apos;s kind of a mess , too .
and when you came in
with all your energy and your wonderful ideas ,
i started feeling like
maybe you were gonna help me put it all back together ...
my house , not my life .
i just want you to work on the house .
i really do sound like a maserati .
thanks for listening .
oh , my god .
oh , my god ! are you all right ?
i didn &apos;t see you there .
you &apos;ve got great legs .
you ever consider just jogging from place to place ?
what were you doing behind my car ?
i thought about what you said .
it &apos;d be a shame if we didn &apos;t finish what we started .
are you sure ? it &apos;s a big job , and the boss is kinda nutty .
i love a challenge .
now can i get your insurance information ?
so ...
how are you doing ?
what &apos;s this ? genuine concern ?
no asking if my breasts feel swollen
or if it &apos;s a heavy flow day ?
i know i was dismissive before ,
and i want to apologize .
i read the pamphlet , and it actually made sense .
becoming a new dad at your age can be pretty scary .
i mean , just looking at that little girl
and knowing you might not be around for her wedding ...
is this supposed to be helping me ?
i &apos;m saying it &apos;s real , and i get it .
and now in order to demonstrate that
i am a loving and caring wife , i have two options .
one , we can have a long , sensitive conversation
about your feelings , or option two ...
as much i like option two ,
i think tonight ...
i wanna talk .
you got it .
what--what &apos;s that ?
i got you a little something .
try it on .
paul ...
this isn &apos;t ... really my style .
let me be the judge of that .
we talked about this . you said we could take it slow .
it &apos;s been almost a week . isn &apos;t that slow enough ?
try it . maybe it &apos;ll put you in the mood .
it won &apos;t .
come on .
paul , no .
how could you possibly think
i would wear something like this ?
what are those ?
the letters you sent me in prison .
read this .
paul , please don &apos;t get upset
out loud .
&quot; i long for you to kiss my neck ,
to whisper in my ear while you unbutton my blouse . &quot;
go on .
&quot; make love to me ...
all night long . &quot;
did you write these ?
it was a fantasy .
i never thought it would be real .
it is real .
paul , please
we &apos;re married now . what did you expect ?
i thought you would stay in prison .
i didn &apos;t mean that .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s not a surprise to me that you have some issues .
i mean , you married a man in prison for murder .
clearly , you are a disturbed young woman .
the good news is ,
i &apos;m willing to help you .
all i ask in return is for a little affection .
do you think you can offer me that ?
i &apos;ll try .
good .
i &apos;m a patient man , beth .
but just so we &apos;re clear ,
i won &apos;t be patient forever .
don &apos;t worry . i cleaned the pot .
the way things have been going lately ,
i &apos;m not as worried about taste as i am poison .
look , what you did was borderline evil .
but you were right to make me talk to tom ,
so i thank you for being a good friend ,
and don &apos;t ever do it again .
you &apos;re welcome .

i think i like having you around .

right here on wisteria lane .
you &apos;re kidding .

we &apos;ll see .
do you really think it &apos;s a good idea
for you to move here ?

it doesn &apos;t matter .
she can never know what happened between us .
have you seen my wife ?

could i have you sign these release forms ?

what &apos;s this torn page on her chart ?
let &apos;s just say your wife has a bit of a temper .
what happened ?
well , it &apos;s not really my place ,
but she did have a strong reaction
when i told her your daughter &apos;s blood type .
gaby did this ?
i need you to tell me exactly what happened .
oh , crap .
gaby , come back here !
it &apos;s not my fault ! i have a disorder !
gaby , we have to talk !
damn it !
gaby !
see you in about two seconds .
okay , here &apos;s what happened .
it was on that ski weekend eight years ago .
i don &apos;t normally go for french guys ,
but you know how i get when i drink too much champagne .
what ?
well , i didn &apos;t think i slept with him , but i must have ,
because why else would our daughter have type @-@ a blood ?
you &apos;re not killing me . why aren &apos;t you killing me ?
baby , come with me .
there &apos;s something i have to tell you .
there are certain kinds of pain
that can &apos;t be treated in a hospital ,
so those who are suffering do what they can
to heal themselves .
some cure the ache of loneliness
by making new friends .
some soothe their excruciating guilt
with an infusion of cash .
some alleviate their burning desire
with small acts of kindness .
but sadly ,
there will always be those who can &apos;t begin to heal ...
because they realize there is more pain
