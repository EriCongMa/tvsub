hang on , hang on !
you &apos;re not gonna die today . hang on .
okay , okay . come here .
okay ? all right .
let &apos;s get the hell out of here .
come on , come on .
what do we have ?
satellite imagery confirms
the factory &apos;s been hit and is burning .
all communications are down .
no audio or video in or out .
where are you on search and rescue ?
i have no authorization to dispatch the coast guard .
my people are on that rig .
that rig was a level @-@ 10 detention facility .
it does not exist . it never existed .
if you think i &apos;m gonna let you and the director
cover your asses at the expense of the lives of my people ,
then you &apos;ve got another -- - off the record --
the factory was bombed
to prevent those terrorists from getting their hands
on vital national secrets .
on the record -- this incident never occurred .
look , if you &apos;re not interested in the detainees , fine .
but there are over 75 people who work for you
who are gonna drown and burn if you do nothing .
if you don &apos;t contact search and rescue , i will .
do that , agent cooper , and you will be relieved of duty .
without confirmation of survivors ,
is it really worth making that call ?
reddington ! where &apos;s keen ?
braxton took her .
are any of these comms working ?
that walkie has a range of a thousand yards at the most .
unassisted , yeah ,
but a dipole antenna array will boost the signal .
this rig is sinking .
if we can &apos;t make contact ,
anyone here who doesn &apos;t burn is gonna drown .
you said braxton took keen . why ?
where am i ?
where are agents ressler and navabi ?
did they make it ?
don &apos;t know .
don &apos;t care .
how does it feel to have something
people are willing to die for
locked up in that pretty , little head of yours ?
i don &apos;t know anything .
we &apos;ll see .
look , i don &apos;t know who gave you clearance to land ,
but we &apos;re closed to traum--
he &apos;s got a g--
sir , i &apos;ve been monitoring flights in and around
the norton sound with proximity to the factory .
the f.a.a. picked up an aircraft
entering juneau airspace
i.d. &apos; d as a private medevac chopper .
the f.a.a. doesn &apos;t require flight plans
or passenger manifests for medevac choppers .
i think that &apos;s how braxton plans to disappear .
where did they land ?
grace river hospital .
get a tac unit there and notify the hospital .
make sure they have braxton &apos;s mug shot .
that incident you insist didn &apos;t occur ,
it just came to shore .
okay , listen up .
juneau pd was unable to apprehend braxton ,
but he was positively i.d. &apos; d .
i want surveillance feeds from every camera
within 10 blocks of that hospital .
sir , the coast guard --
they &apos;re picking up a signal from the factory .
that &apos;s some kind of s.o.s.
survivors .
i &apos;m making that call whether you like it or not .
we &apos;re on final approach .
we need a head count on survivors .
helo two . helo two .
emergency message , plus three .
you &apos;re not going anywhere .
let &apos;s go .
i &apos;m hitting a wall .
she &apos;ll talk .
oh , no . she &apos;s talking .
told me everything she remembered ,
which is nothing .
you saying she wasn &apos;t there ?
i &apos;m saying if she was there ,
she &apos;s repressed her memory --
buried it so deep
that i can &apos;t even get her to talk about it .
the fulcrum .
where is it ?
i envy you -- your ability to block a horrible memory .
i needed help to do that .
lucky for me ,
the person who helped me forget ...
is gonna help you remember .
max , i &apos;m not gonna tell you to pick up your dominoes again .
come on . we got to go . we &apos;re late .
max ?
max ?
hey , doc .
remember me ?
braxton .
max , it &apos;s gonna be okay . it &apos;s gonna be okay .
i don &apos;t know , doc .
depends on you .
what do you want ?
let &apos;s go for a ride .
the princess here
has something in her head that i want .
it &apos;s a memory .
now , you helped make all my memories go away .
you made khafji disappear .
boom ! just like a magic trick .
i &apos;m thinking , if you were able to bury one of my memories ,
then you can retrieve some of hers .
no . it &apos;s not that simple .
mom , they --
they said they won &apos;t hurt me ...
max .
... if you do what they say , so please , mom , plea--
max . don &apos;t hurt him .
don &apos;t you hurt him .
guys , there are people looking for me .
if they find me , they &apos;ll find you .
now you are going to go into her head ,
and you &apos;re going to retrieve a memory .
if you do that , if you help me ,
you &apos;ll be helping max .
do i make myself clear ?
give him a list of everything you &apos;re gonna need .
sebastian , brother . i didn &apos;t think you made it out .
he didn &apos;t .
i did .
oh , man .
this is just like belgrade , huh , boyo ?
whatever you want , i get .
this is nothing like belgrade .
what was the name of that kid ?
you know , the one you had running point ?
i wish i could have been there
when you opened that closet door
and found him hanging by your necktie .
his name was henkel .
henkel ! that &apos;s right .
kid was a talker .
you &apos;re out of your depth , luther .
you don &apos;t know the people you &apos;re dealing with .
you &apos;re a fine thief -- meticulous and careful --
but this is different .
you &apos;re improvising ,
and you and i both know thinking on your feet
is not your strong suit , luther .
you will make a mistake , and when you do ,
i will be there to indulge in the undeniable pleasure
and sweet satisfaction of &quot; i told you so . &quot;
well , you better hurry .
&apos;cause your girlfriend , the princess ,
she &apos;s got the answers in her head that i &apos;m looking for ,
and i found a way to get them out .
i spoke with cooper .
the coast guard pilots who transported us
are being debriefed .
as far as the rest of the world is concerned ,
you are presumed missing .
you need to look for any known associates of braxton &apos;s
with psychiatric medical training --
neurologists , psychiatrists , pharmacologists --
wait . slow down .
braxton is trying to extract a memory from agent keen .
he will do so by any means necessary .
he &apos;s likely contacted someone for that purpose already .
find out who that someone is .
what memory ?
a memory she has no memory of .
you said you had the situation under control .
i do . the strike on the factory was unsuccessful .
and now we have survivors to contend with .
not to mention the incident at the public hospital .
the missile strike will be made public .
it will be blamed on , uh , inmate uprising ,
which got out of hand .
enemy combatants took the facility ,
executed staff , and were preparing to escape .
we unfortunately had no other choice but to act aggressively .
loss of life , although tragic , was unavoidable .
director , is there any accounting for reddington ?
or the fulcrum .
we will have the fulcrum in our hands very shortly .
how ?
i have a team working on it as we speak .
welcome back .
sir , sir , i think i found a doctor
with a connection to braxton .
you &apos;re safe .
uh , w-- uh , what about mr. reddington ?
he &apos;s , uh , pursuing his own leads .
aram , the doctor ?
yes , right . uh , sorry .
okay . her name is dr. selma orchard .
she &apos;s an attending in neurology at walter reed
and was part of a team that discovered a gene
that makes it possible to erase memories .
i &apos;m sorry . erase memories ?
yeah , the gene is known as tet1,
and it &apos;s critical to a process called memory extinction ,
where painful events are replaced
with more positive associations .
she was at walter reed . was braxton a soldier there ?
first gulf war .
he was part of a friendly fire incident
with multiple casualties in khafji .
i assume he brought this home with him .
orchard must have treated him at some point for this .
selma orchard -- find her now .
it &apos;s called recovered memory therapy .
i &apos;m going to use a combination
of hypnotherapy and pharmaceuticals
to put you into a lucid , waking dream state .
my field is in blocking trauma .
extracting it , there are probable risks .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
i &apos;m going to give you a sedative .
the mind turns things off for a reason .
i found that what the mind fights ,
the body tries to fight , too .
i need you relaxed . this is for your own safety .
he told me i need to take you back to a fire
26 years ago .
i don &apos;t want to go back .
i &apos;m sorry .
pd says there &apos;s no sign of forced entry or foul play ,
but orchard never showed up for work .
i just got off the phone with the boy &apos;s school .
he never showed up , either .
braxton has them .
elizabeth , i want you to close your eyes .
now i want you to relax all of the muscles in your body .
pretend that you can float .
as you float , all of the tension leaves your body .
tension floats , too ,
but it floats away from you .
now i want you to breathe in ...
... and out .
good .
all of the tension is floating away .
you can &apos;t even feel it anymore .
all you can feel is yourself ,
making the image of yourself
clearer and clearer .
focus on that image of yourself .
only it &apos;s not you today .
it &apos;s you 26 years ago .
you can almost picture her , that little girl .
i &apos;m gonna ask the little girl to open her eyes .
are you ready ?
three ...
two ...
one .
what do you see ?
a little girl ...
hiding .
okay , stay here , sweetie .
no matter what happens , you need to stay here
and not come out until i come get you . understand ?
are you with her ?
yes .
where is she ?
hey , what &apos;s your bunny &apos;s name ?
i &apos;m not leaving without masha .
masha !
she &apos;s not going back with you .
i know you &apos;re scared , but it &apos;s okay .
lizzy ? can you hear me ?
hello . thank you for coming on such short notice .
time is of the essence , so i &apos;ll skip introductions .
i &apos;ve asked you all here
because you all have one thing in common --
you all have business with luther braxton .
as rewarding as those relationships may have been ,
they &apos;ve come to an end .
mr. braxton has started something he cannot finish .
he &apos;ll likely reach out to one of you for help .
when he does ,
you will contact me at the number i have provided .
questions ?
good .
what &apos;s in it for us ?
life .
where are we on dr. orchard ?
nowhere .
uh , if braxton did abduct her ,
he didn &apos;t leave a trace .
and reddington ?
i &apos;m pretty sure if he had a lead we would have heard from him .
metro pd just called in a possible visual on braxton
near anacostia .
he saw him get into a van with a couple of men
an hour after orchard &apos;s abduction .
did they track it ?
no , the patrolman was on foot .
the van left before he could flag the plate .
get to anacostia and canvass the neighborhood .
knock on every door .
if braxton was there to meet with someone ,
i want to know who .
cooper .
hello , dr. levin .
did you get the results ?
yes . at your office ?
this is not gonna work like this .
these drugs , she could become hypertensive ,
develop an arrhythmia .
i gave you everything you asked for .
well , we should have an anesthesiologist
or an e.r. doc here to titrate her meds .
i told you there are risks .
well , then take the risks .
it &apos;s either her or your boy .
what &apos;s happening , elizabeth ? tell me .
they &apos;re shouting .
who ?
what are they saying ?
where is she ? !
listen , you &apos;re in trouble .
because of you .
don &apos;t be afraid .
you told her .
yes , i did . i told her .
come on !
wait !
come on !
lizzy .
come on .
come on !
wh @-@ where &apos;d he go ?
where &apos;d he go ?
i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;s happening ?
she might be having a tangent memory .
her brain is trying to replace a bad memory with a good one .
over there ! here !
catch me .
lizzy .
lizzy , wait !
what is it ? what do you see ?
stay here .
don &apos;t go anywhere .
what are they fighting about ?
it &apos;s a secret .
who &apos;s masha ?
you are .
... instead they framed masha .
don &apos;t go out there . you can &apos;t go out there .
turn around , lizzy ! go back !
no ! no !
don &apos;t ! daddy said not to come out !
okay , we &apos;re done .
her blood pressure &apos;s through the roof .
she &apos;s in v @-@ tach . she needs lidocaine .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
you won &apos;t find what you &apos;re looking for if she &apos;s dead .
my father .
my father was there .
what have you got ?
braxton contacted me right after you left .
what &apos;s this ?
wiring instructions to an offshore account .
i &apos;m not giving you this information .
i &apos;m selling it .
let me clarify the situation .
braxton is holding a hostage . i want her back .
every second you waste
reduces the chances of that happening .
i appreciate your urgency .
i don &apos;t think you do .
but i &apos;m not telling you anything until we agree on a price .
i have units covering the southwest sector ,
so start at the north end of the 700 block
and work your way back .
anything ?
two eyewitnesses confirm
braxton met with a wilson bishop .
i had aram run his profile .
turns out he &apos;s a third @-@ year med student at johns hopkins .
what does braxton want with a med student ?
your son , what &apos;s his name ?
his name is max .
he &apos;s nine years old .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry you got dragged into this .
in the dream , your father ... you said he was there ?
the girl , she called him &quot; daddy . &quot;
did you see anything else or hear anything else ?
the little girl stopped me .
it &apos;s like she has some kind of a secret .
but i &apos;m the girl .
the girl &apos;s a piece of your subconscious
trying to prevent you from becoming aware
of what happened that night .
i have no recollection of my mother or my father ...
not their faces , nothing .
all i know ... or think i know ...
is that my father gave me this .
you can relax .
an extra 15 seconds won &apos;t make a difference either way .
it &apos;s done .
speak .
he needed a place to meet someone ,
someplace out of the way .
the address ?
no , no .
he &apos;s right .
an extra 15 seconds probably won &apos;t change anything , hmm ?
yes ?
mom ? mommy ?
max !
mom ?
max , hi .
are you okay , baby ?
where are you ?
everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
i love you .
i love you .
you have till 9 : 00 .
if i don &apos;t find out what the agent knows by then ,
you &apos;ll never see your boy again .
wait . wait !
damn it !
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
it &apos;s too dangerous .
something happened that night ,
something people are willing to kill to find out ,
and whatever it was involved my father .
i &apos;m not doing this for braxton or for you .
i &apos;m doing it for me . i need to know the truth .
where is it ?
i &apos;ll have it to you by 9 : 00 .
i thought you said you had it already .
and i do .
i wanted that fulcrum in my hands
before i negotiated with you .
need i remind you that the price had already been set ?
that was before you volleyed missiles at me and my men .
now the price has gone up .
mr. braxton , i don &apos;t think you fully appreciate
the power of the people who have engaged your services .
well , if they &apos;re that powerful ,
then i &apos;m sure they can afford an extra 10 % .
go find the money , chief .
you do that ,
and i &apos;ll have what you want by 9 : 00 .
hey , i want you to call me
just as soon as you get confirmation of funds .
nah , we &apos;re gonna get the intel out of that girl &apos;s head ,
even if i got to drill a hole in her skull
and hang her upside down .
all right .
will do .
if you &apos;re looking for your driver ,
he &apos;s napping in the trunk .
son of a bitch .
luther , i never thought i &apos;d enjoy
having anything in my mouth
as much as petty officer virginia sherman ,
but this ...
my god !
it tastes so good !
i hesitate to swallow ,
and i certainly don &apos;t want to spit it out .
oh , what the hell .
i told you so .
elizabeth keen .
where is she ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe she &apos;s dead .
maybe you &apos;re too late , boyo .
just like you were for , uh , henkel ...
in belgrade .
can i let you in on a little secret about belgrade ?
i barely remember it .
i &apos;d forgotten all about the deutsche marks ,
and i don &apos;t think i ever even met henkel .
tell you the truth -- i don &apos;t think his name was henkel .
i don &apos;t know who the hell he was , but this --
this , i can promise you ,
i will always remember .
now get in the damn car .
elizabeth , can you hear me ?
nod if you can hear me .
good .
now follow my voice and tell me where you are .
the closet .
what &apos;s happening ?
they &apos;ll kill you if you don &apos;t give it back to them .
they &apos;ll kill me if i do .
they &apos;re arguing .
what are they arguing about ?
did you really think i &apos;d let it happen
and i wouldn &apos;t come for her ?
the fulcrum .
it &apos;s the only thing keeping me alive .
wilson bishop , fbi .
come here . come here .
what are you doing , man ? what are you doing ?
luther braxton .
we know you met with him .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you &apos;re a resident at a hospital
with access to all kinds of psychopharmaceuticals .
we know you sold to him .
he kidnapped an fbi agent .
i don &apos;t know anything about a kidnapping .
he &apos;s gonna use your drugs on that agent .
she dies ...
he wanted diazoxide .
naloxone .
where is he ?
he had me deliver equipment ...
for sedations .
an address ? !
braxton , call me back . where the hell are you ?
is she okay ?
i &apos;m not gonna hurt you .
is she okay ?
aram , we found wilson bishop .
we &apos;re en route ,
and we need you to send units to coal chute and spring .
donald .
i have information regarding agent keen &apos;s abductor .
we &apos;re on the way to her now . we &apos;re 10 minutes out .
well , braxton was holding a young boy .
his name is max orchard .
my people have secured the boy , but you need to send a unit .
dembe will give you the address .
max is my son .
the fbi are on their way to him now .
she &apos;s still heavily sedated .
what happened ?
but my son ... max .
your son is gonna be fine .
tell me about agent keen .
she was undergoing a procedure called rm therapy .
braxton was searching for a memory .
does she remember the past ?
pieces .
what pieces ?
a fire , an argument .
she remembers something called the fulcrum .
does she know where it is -- the fulcrum ?
no .
but we were close .
if she continued , would it be dangerous for her ?
could she be harmed in any way ?
it &apos;s hard to say . she &apos;s been through a lot .
but typically , if the therapy is done properly
and with great care ,
then no .
can you see it ? can you hear me , lizzy ?
take her to ...
i need you to tell me where it is .
where is the fulcrum , lizzy ?
let me go ! get away from me !
you don &apos;t want to see this .
what you want to see ,
what you need to find is the fulcrum .
where is it , lizzy ?
can you see it ?
lizzy , turn around .
go back .
stop !
you don &apos;t want to go in there .
get away !
lizzy , turn around and go back .
go back , go back .
let go !
what happened ?
what &apos;d she see ?
listen to me .
you have to say something . there &apos;s a fire .
i know you saw something out there
and you don &apos;t want to go out there
but you can &apos;t stay here .
you have to scream . do you hear me ?
as loud as you can , you have to scream !
you have to ...
what the hell are you doing to her ?
what are you doing ?
get her up . wake her up now .
not now .
reddington . reddington !
it &apos;s not safe .
wake her up now .
wait .
not now .
you do what you have to do . you do it now !
wait .
daddy ! no !
you were there .
you were there , weren &apos;t you ?
yes .
there were ...
people with the woman , looking for it .
the fulcrum .
you were one of them .
it &apos;s not that simple .
but that &apos;s why you were there .
that &apos;s why you came into my life then .
and that &apos;s why you &apos;re here now .
not because of me
or who i am to you ,
whatever connection we might have ,
but because of some ...
object .
some thing .
whatever you remember --
what i remember is leaving my father dying
on the floor of a burning house .
there &apos;s no way he could have survived that .
lizzy , the memories of a four @-@ year @-@ old are ...
unreliable .
my father was killed because of the fulcrum ,
because you and your people came for it that night .
well , i want you to know something .
this charade ...
of you pretending to care about me
was a waste of your time
because i don &apos;t know where it is .
don &apos;t !
mommy .
max !
are you okay ? are you okay ? are you okay ?
look at you .
thank god .
i &apos;m meeting with braxton within the hour .
yes , of course i &apos;ve discussed contingencies
regarding reddington with all of our colleagues .
i &apos;m going to have to call you back .
you wouldn &apos;t believe how much he weighs .
sit .
do you have any idea who i am ?
yes .
i know just what you are .
sit the hell down .
i &apos;ve alerted security .
you seem younger in person than you appear to be
when lurking in the background on television .
are you a swimmer ?
i &apos;m someone not to be trifled with .
then we have something in common .
you hire a simple thief to find the fulcrum
because you believe i don &apos;t have it .
so i return him to you , defects and all ,
to make it abundantly clear that you should never again
doubt who i am and what i have .
i know exactly who you are .
a thug .
you may have convinced some of my colleagues
that you are a force to be reckoned with ,
but i do not share that assessment .
so consider yourself warned .
we will not hesitate to use every resource
at our disposal .
whatever it takes ...
we will cripple you .
i don &apos;t think you have any real comprehension
of the depth and breadth of your vulnerability .
but only the one who possesses the fulcrum
could possibly fathom that .
i think you &apos;re bluffing .
i don &apos;t think you have it .
i don &apos;t think you ever did .
try me .
call my bluff .
please .
call my bluff .
oh , my god .
i don &apos;t know what the hell you &apos;re gonna do with him .
honestly , he &apos;s like a damn side of beef .
you &apos;re not gonna believe this .
what is it ?
this morning , there was an attempted takeover ...
... of a u.s. detention camp in the norton sound .
we believe that the timing of this uprising
... was set to coincide with the transfer ...
of international fugitive raymond reddington .
are you saying that he was responsible for the breach ?
how did he orchestrate an attack if he was in custody ?
i @-@ i &apos;m not going to be taking any questions right now ,
but i can confirm
that the whereabouts of raymond reddington
are unknown .
thank you for meeting me .
you said it was urgent ?
i didn &apos;t mean to alarm you ,
but i thought you should know that during the rm therapy ,
when you were under , i saw something .
so , what ? what does that mean ?
based on how you responded ...
liz , i don &apos;t think i &apos;m the first one ...
who &apos;s looked into your memory .
no . i &apos;ve never been treated .
you may not remember .
you may have been very young .
but i think someone may have tried to block ...
your memory of that fire .
i didn &apos;t make it up .
the people and the events may have been there ,
but in different roles .
i know this is difficult to comprehend .
are you telling me i may never know
what really happened that night ?
i &apos;m telling you that the only
people who could tell you what really happened ...
... are the people who want you to forget .
