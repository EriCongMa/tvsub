and i don &apos;t want to waste another day
playing games in the middle of nowhere .
you guys , we &apos;re in hawaii .
we should be drinking mai tais on the beach .

you killed my frittata .
i put it out of its misery .
all right , i was just about to do that . okey ?
frittata ?
grace had a spinach frittata the other day for brunch .
she really enjoyed it , so i was gonna make her one .
i was going to surprise her .
you have aneurism face . why ?
what happened to my house ?
oh , this . okay , well , this is gonna be clean .
you see , i have a very intricate pile system going here .
you have a pile system ?
do me a favor , remind me of your pile system
the next time i ask you to house @-@ sit , okay ?
just ...
wha ... ? the dog &apos;s here ?
you know ... you like ... what ?
you brought the dog ?
i didn &apos;t ... i didn &apos;t mean to bring the dog , okay ?
rachel called me last @-@ minute .
she had to leave town , so i had to dog @-@ sit .
don &apos;t worry about it , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m gonna change the sheets immediately .
i was actually planning on doing it ...
you let the dog ... you let the dog sleep in my bed ?
well , the couch does not fit the two of us ,
and that &apos;s where i like to sleep , as you know .
so i ...
how was your vacation with catherine on the battleship ?
it wasn &apos;t a vacation , danny ,
it was a week &apos;s worth of a.t. ,
and it was on a , uh , it was on an aircraft carrier .
it &apos;s a ... they &apos;re different boats .
okay ?
yeah , it &apos;s mcgarrett .
i &apos;ll be right there .
okay , uh , emeril ...
we got a body .
witness claims she saw the victim
stumbling out of the jungle .
he left a blood trail .
kono &apos;s with hpd right now
looking for the primary crime scene .
all right . we i.d. the vic ?
no .
and by all appearances , he wasn &apos;t carrying a wallet .
or wearing pants , for that matter .
pants ?
gentlemen ,
welcome to early polynesia hawaii .
this guy better have some underwear under that loincloth .
hawaiians call that a malo .
i call it an invitation to chafing .
all right , why &apos;s he dressed like a koa ?
well , it &apos;s quite the mystery-- his tattoos are genuine ,
as are the articles of clothing .
worm holes not with standing ,
it &apos;s as if our hawaiian warrior
并提供时间旅行的可能性
just appeared from some other time period .
well , max , time travel doesn &apos;t exist .
well , quite the contrary , commander mcgarrett .
i can assure you the theory is quite sound .
in fact , there has been recent ...
okay , okay , max , zip it .
please . respectfully .
for argument &apos;s sake , let &apos;s just say that
this guy did not own a delorean . let &apos;s also say
he &apos;s from the 21st century , 30 &apos;s , male .
what else do we know ?
well , there &apos;s bruising around the neck and head area ,
which indicates that he suffered
blunt @-@ force trauma . however , it is
the severing of the carotid
that led to his death-- which leads me to this discovery .
a shark &apos;s tooth ?
indeed .
let &apos;s assume that a shark didn &apos;t roll up
into the jungle and kill this guy-- what did ?
well , judging from his appearance ,
and how he died , i &apos;d go with a leiomano .
a what ?
a leiomano-- it &apos;s a small paddle
with shark teeth sewn around the edges .
weapon of choice for hawaiian warriors .
200 years ago .
question is ,
who has access to one today ?
how about a hundred hawaiian warriors ?
anyone who wants to reconsider my time travel hypothesis ?
game off !
all right , collect everybody &apos;s weapons .
get everybody &apos;s info ,
and nobody leaves , okay ?
nobody leaves .
careful .
steve .
mamo .
i didn &apos;t know you were , uh ...
involved in these reenactments .
i &apos;m one of the founders .
we stage the great battles of king kamehameha .
i take it you &apos;re not here to sign up .
no , i &apos;m afraid not , mamo .
your , uh , fake battle just had a real casualty .
my god .
that &apos;s brandon koruba .
yeah . his body was found
a couple of hundred yards away from here .
when was the last time you saw him ?
at the last reenactment , a month ago .
he was supposed to be here today , but never showed .
it was strange , &apos; cause i saw his car
in the parking lot-- i thought maybe
he was just taking his time getting ready .
did he have a beef with any of these guys , do you know ?
no way . no way . brandon was ohana .
everyone liked him .
besides , these men wouldn &apos;t hurt anyone .
they &apos;re doctors , teachers , engineers .
they &apos;re also armed .
mamo , uh , is it possible something like this could happen
by accident ?
no way .
we &apos;re all history buffs ,
trying to preserve and celebrate our culture .
and the worst that happens : dehydration ...
maybe a broken ankle .
well , not today .
mamo , we need a list
of everybody who signed on for this event , okay ?
no @-@ shows included , all right ?
sure . whatever you need .
thanks .
thanks , mamo .
there are some more blood drops over here .
broken branches .
ground &apos;s been disturbed .
definitely some sort of a struggle went down .
i &apos;ve got arterial blood spatter .
likely due to the strike at the victim &apos;s neck .
okay , well , looks like we found
our primary crime scene .
hey , i got something .
what is it ?
looks like a bone fragment of some kind .
there &apos;s tool markings .
and a drilled hole .
our victim wasn &apos;t wearing anything like this .
based on the crazing and discoloration , i &apos;d say
it &apos;s at least a hundred years old .
what &apos;s that ?
appears to be a strand of hair .
all right .
let &apos;s get this to fong
and see if he can run dna .
hold this .
hey , chin .
hey , kono . what &apos;s up ?
we found the primary crime scene .
we ran a preliminary process , and we found something .
a fragment that doesn &apos;t match anything the victim was wearing .
hmm . okay , let &apos;s have a look .
okay , it &apos;s on its way .
could belong to our killer
and broke off during the struggle .
okay , we have any idea what it is ?
um ... part of a larger artifact of some kind .
oh . it &apos;s lucky for us we know an expert .
what are you talking about ? gabby ?
what , you and dr. asano on the outs or something ?
no , we &apos;re good . why ?
you sure ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure .
okay , well , that &apos;s a relief .
why is that a relief ?
well , &apos; cause she makes you happy .
and i like to see you happy , brah .
so you gonna ask her about the fragment ?
yeah , i &apos;ll ask her about the fragment .
all right , kono and i will go talk to the vic &apos;s wife ,
see what she knows .
all right , shoots .
danny , you ever need any advice
on relationships , my door is always open .
oh , good , well , you go ahead and keep that door closed ,
but thank you .
mrs. koruba , can you think of anyone
who might want to hurt your husband ?
no .
nobody .
we &apos;re looking into everyone
who was at the reenactment .
he loved those events .
he used to say the battles were great stress relievers ,
if you can believe that .
plus , being part of the living history of the island--
it ... meant a lot to him .
what kind of work did he do ?
brandon designed boats .
he built the company from the ground up .
he was lucky--
his job was his passion .
he loved being out on the water , exploring the islands .
even after all these years , he said
he learned something new every time he went out .
i feel that same way , too .
then you would have liked brandon .
he grew up here
and he arrived at a place in his life
where he was proud of his roots ...
proud of his connection to this island .
well , you can see that .
this is quite an impressive collection of hawaiian art .
that &apos;s another one of brandon &apos;s passions .
each piece was culturally significant to him .
maybe you can help us identify something .
we found it at the crime scene .
do you recognize it ?
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sure
brandon would have , but ... i don &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry to just drop in on you like this .
oh , that &apos;s okay , i &apos;m glad you did .
is there any chance
that hair was found on this fragment ?
yes , actually , there was .
how &apos;d you know that ?
follow me .
so i &apos;m sorry that grace was sick last weekend .
is she feeling better ?
yes , full recovery , she &apos;s good .
that &apos;s great .
thanks for asking .
i was really looking forward
to you bringing her by the museum .
i was , too . we &apos;ll , uh , we &apos;ll reschedule .
anytime .
okay , i &apos;ll call you , we &apos;ll set it up .
all right .
it &apos;s called a lei niho palaoa .
it &apos;s early 19th century .
the hook is made from the tooth of a sperm whale
and it &apos;s suspended from numerous thin braids of human hair .
that would explain the hair .
yeah .
high @-@ ranking men or women used to wear them
as emblems of status .
they are extremely rare .
okay , so how would somebody
get their hands on something like this ?
well , they come up for sale every once in a while ,
but there aren &apos;t many private collectors worldwide ,
though i think one of them lives here on the island .
really , well , could we get his name ?
absolutely , give me one second .
his name is brandon koruba .
oh , good .
that bad news ?
he &apos;s our victim .
but he , uh , he wasn &apos;t
wearing the necklace when we found the body .
all we found was the fragment .
maybe the killer knew it was valuable , and so he took it .
tell me something ,
how much could you get for something like this ?
it &apos;s difficult to say ,
but the last one to sell at auction went for $ 27,000 .
$ 27,000-- that , uh , sounds like motive .
yeah , yeah , it sounds like motive .
so what was that all about ?
what was what all about ?
well , i know grace wasn &apos;t sick last weekend .
uh , yes , she was . you calling me a liar ?
yeah .
i mean , you do a thing when you lie .
i do a thing . what thing do i do ?
you &apos;re doing it now .
you mean sitting here having a conversation--
that thing ?
you &apos;re a squinter , you squint .
i &apos;m a squinter ?
yeah .
okay , well , if you haven &apos;t noticed ,
the sun is blasting me in my face all the time .
see , where i come from ,
they got a break from that sort of torture .
they are called clouds , weather .
here we don &apos;t have that so much , you see .
right , see , now you &apos;re avoiding .
i &apos;m not avoiding anything .
i know grace wasn &apos;t sick last weekend
because you guys went to the zoo .
remember , you told me about the zoo .
i &apos;m just wondering why you lied .
you don &apos;t have to tell me if y--
i &apos;m just wondering , it &apos;s weird .
okay , would you shut up ,
please , okay ?
it &apos;s not like it was premeditated .
i was put on the spot .
i just want to make sure that things are good
between gabby and i before i introduce her to my daughter .
why don &apos;t you understand that ? that doesn &apos;t make sense to you ?
yeah , i do understand . when &apos;s that gonna be ,
when grace is 30 ?
you guys have been dating for three months .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s time they met ?
three months is not a long time .
three months is like a lifetime for a kid .
don &apos;t you want grace to know that you &apos;re happy ?
you &apos;re her daddy .
hey , i am happy .
you &apos;re never happy .
i &apos;m happy when i &apos;m not around you .
that &apos;s a lie , too .
you love me . okay , you know what i think it is ?
i think this is less about you protecting gracie
and more about you protecting yourself .
oh , right , i forgot ,
because you &apos;re an expert on relationships .
you &apos;re married with kids , you know everything ,
so let me ask you a question , genius ,
okay , what happens when grace gets attached
and things don &apos;t work out between me and gabby , huh ?
or what happens when things do work out between gabby and i
and then grace doesn &apos;t like her ?
then what , then what do i do ?
let me ask you a question : how you gonna know if you don &apos;t try ?
what happens if you shut up and let me run my own camp ,
and i &apos;ll introduce them when i feel like
it &apos;s the right time ? how about that ?
can you hold on for a second , please ?
sure .
excuse me .
chin , hey , what &apos;s up ?
so we checked into
the background of all the participants
in the reenactment and we got a hit with hpd .
seth burgess .
he was arrested four years ago
for trafficking stolen antiquities .
okay , so he &apos;s a smart perp .
i mean , by doing these battle reenactments ,
he puts himself in the world of big @-@ time collectors
like brandon koruba .
i checked with mamo .
he said that he saw seth before the reenactment ,
but he slipped out early .
okay .
we get an address ?
i &apos;m sending it over .
duke . what are you doing here ?
guy inside &apos;s been squatting . what are you doing here ?
well , the guy inside is our murder suspect .
his name is seth burgess .
yeah ? well , we evicted him a few times before ,
but this time he &apos;s barricaded himself in .
anybody else in there with him ?
not that we know of .
all right .
we got a report he might be armed .
okay .
all right , we &apos;re going to have to breach .
i &apos;m gonna go get the tac gear .
what &apos;s he doing ?
undoubtedly something insane .
might want to pull your guys off the house .
all units , move back and away from the house .
move , move , move , move !
back and away , move !
move ! just back up but keep a perimeter .
this is my house , yeah ?
all units , move in , move in .
suspect is out of the house . move in .
turn around and face the house .
hands above your head .
very subtle , buddy .
i mean , who would have thought--
tear gas grenade down the skylight ?
oh , yeah , yeah , you .
it was either that
or cook one of your frittatas , danny .
you know what i mean ?
that &apos;s , that &apos;s good .
clear !
danny !
looks like i found our motive .
i &apos;ll see your motive and raise you a murder weapon .
congratulations , seth .
your squatting days are over .
you got a bunk and three squares a day
courtesy of the taxpayers of hawaii .
did you really kill brandon koruba so that you could
take his necklace and use it to pay your rent ?
you got it all wrong-- i didn &apos;t kill him .
well , why was the murder weapon in your house ?
we &apos;re processing it right now .
as soon as the prints and the dna come back ,
you will be charged with brandon koruba &apos;s murder .
test it all you want . i didn &apos;t kill him .
we found brandon &apos;s necklace in your house
with his blood still on it .
you know how that looks ?
okay , look , i was on my way to the reenactment
and i heard a woman scream .
i went to help ,
and that &apos;s when i found brandon lying in the woods ,
but he was already dead .
i took the necklace .
it was worth a fortune .
all i could think about was how much i needed the money ,
and brandon sure as hell didn &apos;t need it anymore .
wow , you &apos;re a sentimental guy .
what i did was wrong , but i didn &apos;t kill anybody .
just got off the phone with fong .
looks like the shark tooth we pulled
from the vic &apos;s wound is the real deal .
problem is , the shark teeth on seth &apos;s
leiomano are plastic .
meaning it can &apos;t be the murder weapon .
yes , also meaning that seth probably is
just an opportunistic dumb ass , after all .
okay , maybe koruba wasn &apos;t killed over this necklace .
we need to dig into koruba &apos;s life-- business and personal .
what do we got so far ?
all right , well , koruba ran a company--
pacific shipyards . they design and built cutters--
high @-@ end yachts .
according to his financials ...
the guy was loaded .
hey , i just checked koruba &apos;s phone records .
he got a call from his company right around tod .
who was he talking to ?
call came from his business partner &apos;s line-- tony dennison .
how long did they talk for ?
little over 12 minutes .
so , wait a minute , he was talking business when he
should have been participating in the reenactment ?
yeah , his wife said he loved those events ,
so whatever the call was about , it must
have been important for him to take it .
yeah , and it might have had something to do with his murder .
what &apos;s this i hear about you inviting people
to the hilton on friday night ?
you sound surprised .
well , when i heard that you , uh , you offered to pay the tab ,
yeah , i was , i was surprised .
ah , well , you heard right .
okay , you gonna conveniently forget your wallet on friday night ?
no , that is your move .
that is my move , you &apos;re right .
so what &apos;s the occasion ?
no occasion .
no occasion ?
no .
oh , okay , who &apos;s going ?
do you need a guest list before you decide to come ?
i just want to know who &apos;s going .
friends . friends are going .
oh , good .
all right , good .
what &apos;s the deal ?
there &apos;s no deal . what , there &apos;s got to be a deal
because i invite my friends to dinner ?
you never invite your friends anywhere .
incorrect . i just did .
okay .
is gabby going ?
okay , now you &apos;re making a deal out of it .
you &apos;re doing it . stop !
all right , just show up to dinner , please .
i would love to come to dinner .
thank you .
it was just an ordinary phone call .
we talked about boat specs , uh ,
concept delivery estimates .
we needed to nail down a few dates .
okay .
did he sound stressed ?
nah , he was in a good mood .
battle reenactments always put brandon in a good mood .
he said the war cries were cathartic .
makes sense to me .
he invited me to go along , but it really wasn &apos;t my thing .
how long were you guys partners ?
15 years .
we built nearly 100 vessels together .
long time .
what &apos;s this all about ?
environmental activists .
we &apos;re a frequent target &apos; cause of the work we do .
boats are like cars .
there &apos;s fuel and oil pollution you just can &apos;t avoid .
this is from a group that calls itself urthstrike .
you know , we try to minimize our carbon footprint ,
be eco @-@ friendly , but
short of going out of business , you can &apos;t please everyone .
these guys hit you often ?
at least once a month .
we upped our security , added a few night guards ,
but they still manage to get their point across .
but up until now , it &apos;s just been vandalism .
you ever call the cops ?
they can &apos;t find these guys .
they &apos;re too good at covering their tracks .
these guys ever threaten you or brandon personally ?
i &apos;ll show you .
brandon koruba ,
you &apos;d have us believe
that you &apos;re a friend to the environment .
truth is , you &apos;re nothing more than a fraud .
you &apos;ve turned a blind eye
while your company looks to profit off the death
of endangered marine life .
might mean little to you--
nothing more than casualties along the way of making a buck .
but here &apos;s the deal , brandon .
you build this new machine of death ,
and i &apos;ll make sure you &apos;re casualty number one .
hell , i &apos;ll see to it personally .
why doesn &apos;t he tell us how he really feels ?
yeah , the man on the screen is urthstrike &apos;s big gun .
by the sound of it , he &apos;s made the fight
against koruba &apos;s company pretty personal .
does this big gun got a name ?
i &apos;m still working on that . despite his group &apos;s heavy
online presence , he &apos;s done a pretty good job
of keeping his identity under wraps .
koruba &apos;s wife never mentioned any threats .
no . dennison said he kept
them from her , he didn &apos;t want her to worry .
okay , so , what &apos;s this machine of death he &apos;s talking about ?
that is pacific shipyards &apos; new interisland transport carrier .
it goes into production later this month .
promises to ferry a couple hundred people
from various ports around the islands .
urthstrike says that the traffic will hurt
hawaii &apos;s humpback and monk seal populations ,
animals already on the endangered list .
okay , wait .
this guy kills koruba over monk seals ?
he makes it pretty clear on the video .
yeah , wait . we &apos;re not actually considering urthstrike
as a viable suspect , are we ?
what are you saying ?
well , they &apos;re environmentalists .
i mean , they fight to preserve island life , not destroy it .
yeah , but how far are they willing to
go to protect their home ?
this guy , whoever he is-- him and his crew--
they &apos;re anarchists . they &apos;re dangerous .
okay , well , he might be guilty of being a zealot ,
but murdering koruba in cold blood-- i don &apos;t see it .
you &apos;re defending these people ?
boss , i @-@ i know people like this .
i grew up with them .
they may break the law ,
abuse a can of spray paint and tag the hull of a boat ,
but they &apos;re not killers .
yeah . not unless they don &apos;t get what they want .
kono , they &apos;ve made several threatening videos like this ,
all targeting brandon koruba .
that makes him a suspect .
okay , all right , so then tell me this .
how &apos;s a guy who has more twitter followers
than justin bieber a ghost ?
he &apos;s careful . look .
in all of his videos ,
he wears a mask .
hold on .
he &apos;s not that careful . go back .
stop .
he touched the lens with his thumb .
put it in .
could be a viable print .
bingo .
kevin creed . he &apos;s got a couple
of misdemeanors , and an address in kailua .
stop right there !
don &apos;t move ! freeze !
everybody , put your hands behind your heads .
interlock your fingers , turn and face the back wall .
you understand ?
hey , you , stop right now .
hands behind your head . step forward .
who are you ?
i &apos;m a pacifist .
really ? what &apos;s your name ?
allison .
rest of the house is clear .
where &apos;s creed ?
hey , it &apos;s not a difficult question . go ahead .
tell her . where &apos;s creed ?
kono , listen to me . he &apos;s heading for sand island .
take libby and cut him off .
copy that .
water !
i see it .
that &apos;s not the answer i was looking for .
this is great .
you just drowned our only suspect .
help me !
help me !
could you hold this , please ?
please .
come on . come on . on the ground !
give me your other hand .
i thought you couldn &apos;t swim .
yeah , well , now you know .
book &apos; em , danno .
why don &apos;t you go book me a towel ?
you know , it &apos;s not the smartest move ,
posting threatening videos online .
i mean , you basically tweeted a murder confession .
we also found surveillance tapes in the beach house .
we know you were stalking brandon koruba .
you were just waiting for the right opportunity
to kill him , right ?
i never said i would kill brandon .
oh , right , right , all you said was ,
you would personally see to it he was casualty number one .
yes . casualty as in death of his business , not his life .
you really think a jury &apos;s going to believe that ?
i don &apos;t care what they believe .
i didn &apos;t kill brandon koruba .
yeah , i hated everything he stood for .
and everybody knew it .
okay . brandon portrayed himself
as some island patriot ,
but the truth is , he was a liar .
a hypocrite . he didn &apos;t
care about the environment , never did .
it was all a marketing tool ,
so he could sell yachts and fatten his bank account .
and you were the one to stop him .
somebody needed to . i drew the line
when he was going to build a boat that would butcher
animals on the endangered list . that should matter .
matter so much , it was worth killing him over ?
are you deaf ?
i ... didn &apos;t kill him .
but ...
i &apos;d like to shake the hand of the person who did .
hey , boss , can i see you for a moment ?
creed &apos;s lawyer is upstairs .
he says we have the wrong guy .
an attorney who thinks his client &apos;s innocent .
that &apos;s a first .
yeah , i know , but he &apos;s not going anywhere
until we release creed .
where is he ?
in your office .
kevin creed was on the big island
when brandon koruba was murdered ,
so i insist you release him right now .
yeah , i bet you have witnesses who can attest to that , too .
yes . i was with him .
it &apos;s convenient , isn &apos;t it ?
you know , we dug into creed &apos;s financials .
he &apos;s not exactly a man who can afford
a beach house on diamond head .
but you know what ? i bet you could .
well , let &apos;s just say that kevin creed
has some very influential people
invested in what he and urthstrike are doing .
okay , let me tell you something .
i don &apos;t care who his friends are ,
i don &apos;t care how powerful his connections are .
murder charges aside , we got him
on reckless endangerment and evading arrest .
you can hold him on as many charges as you want , commander ,
but you are barking up the wrong tree .
i don &apos;t think i am , counselor . we know
for a fact that your client wanted
to derail koruba &apos;s interisland ferry at any cost .
my client didn &apos;t need to derail the ferry .
koruba did that for him .
excuse me ?
according to my sources ,
koruba let the permits lapse two days ago .
the interisland ferry wasn &apos;t happening .
why ?
i heard he had a change of heart .
realized the environmental impact
and pulled the plug .
you see , kevin creed won that battle .
so you tell me-- why would he want to hurt koruba ?
right .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i &apos;d like to see my client .
thanks .
hey , so , creed &apos;s alibi checked out .
there &apos;s video of creed leaving
the kona marina on the big island at tod .
so his lawyer was telling the truth .
yeah , but this is what i don &apos;t get .
so , pacific shipyards stood to net $ 100 million
from the interisland ferry project .
why throw that away ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe urthstrike finally got to him ,
scared him into believing what he was doing was wrong .
yeah , or maybe there was another reason .
okay , well , if anybody knows ,
it &apos;s koruba &apos;s business partner .
right . kono , head to the department of transportation ,
find out what you can about those permits .
danny and i will head down , talk to dennison ,
find out why koruba changed his mind .
copy .
hey , hey , hey .
yeah ?
you , uh , you &apos;re coming friday night , right ?
yeah , the hilton , 7 : 00 .
told you i &apos;d be there the first time you asked me .
just , uh , don &apos;t forget your wallet .
mrs. koruba ?
officer kalakaua .
i heard on the news that you had somebody in custody .
i had to come here .
i need to know .
who is it ?
it looks like the person we have in custody
didn &apos;t kill your husband .
are you any closer to finding out who did ?
we &apos;re still looking .
there is something that you might be able to help us with .
did brandon ever say why he shut down the interisland ferry ?
i didn &apos;t know about that .
we heard he pulled the permits .
he never mentioned any of this to you ?
no , i had no idea .
do you think that &apos;s why he was murdered ?
it &apos;s possible .
but we &apos;re not sure .
excuse me . excuse me , ma &apos;am .
steve mcgarrett , five @-@ o.
we &apos;re looking for tony dennison .
i &apos;m sorry , he just stepped out .
you know where he went ?
i don &apos;t know .
he got an urgent call .
urgent call from whom ?
mrs. koruba .
mrs. koruba .
how long ago was this ?
15 minutes ago .
okay , thank you .
why would tony dennison be going to see megan koruba ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe they &apos;re commiserating .
they just lost somebody they both were close to .
yeah , maybe . kono , what do you got ?
all right , so i just left the d.o.t.
looks like the lawyer was right .
koruba did let the permits lapse .
did you find out why ?
well , according to the d.o.t. ,
koruba felt he couldn &apos;t move forward
knowing what the costs were to the environment .
okay , so he finally had a change of heart .
well , it makes sense , knowing what we know about koruba
and his connection to the island .
but get this , a request to renew the permits
was filed a few hours after koruba was murdered .
by whom ?
koruba &apos;s business partner , tony dennison .
there &apos;s our motive .
dennison stood to lose the most
if koruba killed the deal on the boat .
yeah , and with him dead , he had the most to gain .
maybe dennison killed his own partner
just to keep the interisland ferry project alive .
kono , listen to me .
see if you can get a lock on dennison &apos;s cell .
we just spoke to his assistant ,
who implied that he was off to see megan koruba .
that &apos;s strange .
i just saw mrs. koruba earlier .
you didn &apos;t by any chance
tell her anything about this case , did you ?
i just asked her about brandon letting the permits lapse ,
but she said she didn &apos;t know anything about it .
hold on , hold on . why would you do that ?
well , she wasn &apos;t a suspect . why ?
maybe she was lying , i don &apos;t know .
we &apos;ll call you back .
okay , okay , okay .
are you thinking what i am thinking ?
yeah , if you &apos;re thinking that megan realized
that we were on to dennison , and she tipped him off
that we were coming to see him today , yeah .
dennison and koruba &apos;s wife were in on this together .
that is what i &apos;m thinking .
kono , did you get a lock on dennison &apos;s phone ?
i &apos;m pulling up a trace now .
if koruba &apos;s wife
tipped off dennison to the fact that we &apos;re onto them ,
i guarantee you they &apos;re on the run now .
kono , have the coast guard ,
sheriffs and tsa on alert ,
and check and see if any airline tickets have been purchased
under either of their names .
i followed up on dennison &apos;s alibi .
turns out , the call we
thought he made
from his office to koruba around t.o.d. was actually
patched through his office to his cell phone .
dennison &apos;s assistant says
he gave her very specific instructions
on when and where to make that call .
all right . did you pull his cell records ?
yeah . and the cell tower
he was closest to was actually less than a mile
from the reenactment site .
all right , i got him .
kualani lane and kahala avenue .
that &apos;s brandon and megan koruba &apos;s house .
they haven &apos;t left .
five @-@ o !
megan .
thank god . do something .
put the gun down , megan .
megan , you don &apos;t want to do this .
he killed my husband .
she &apos;s crazy .
do something .
brandon loved you like a brother .
why ? just so you could build a ferry ?
you killed him
just so you could make more money ? !
megan .
