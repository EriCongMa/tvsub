两位被抱怨次数最少的人到场
and that &apos;s why i really don &apos;t believe there &apos;s a god .
thank you , and god bless america .
you were only supposed to lead us in the pledge of allegiance .
i &apos;m pretty it was in there somewhere .
oh . now , let me conclude by thanking moe the bartender
for hosting this meeting
while city hall is fumigated for bedbugs .
bedbugs ?
just why is there a bed in city hall ?
er , uh , meeting adjourned !
* all night long *
* all night *
* all night long *
* all night *
* all night long *
* all night *
* all night long *
* everyone you meet *
* they &apos;re jamming in the street *
this is so convenient !
i can go straight from doing my civic duty
to having a beer with my best friend carl .
and i can toss back a duff sangre de los muertos
死亡之路
with my best friend : mexican duffman .
hey , moe , who &apos;s your best friend ?
well , uh ... well , i just made friends
with pepto @-@ bismol on facebook , and , uh ... um ...
hey , would you look at that ? there &apos;s a spot on the bar .
come on !
you know what ?
i think moe &apos;s best friend is really that bar rag .
that &apos;s even sadder than being friends with milhouse !
you know something , bart ?
i &apos;m getting tired of things like that .
tired of what ? i dump on you , and you take it .
that &apos;s how friendship works .
not anymore . friendship over .
taxi !
what gives ? he &apos;s not crawling back .
even a kid who wears a &quot; finding nemo &quot; back brace has some pride .
you went too far this time , bart.
hey , moe ! i got a job here for your &quot; best friend , &quot; the bar rag .
me , too !
witty .
great meeting , though .
yes , that &apos;s right , everyone laugh at the rag .
but i was not always
this be @-@ stained swatch you see before you .
oh , no , gentles .
we begin in early medieval france ...
今日农奴状况 命运悲惨
a young peasant wife struggles to feed her family ...
maman , we are starving ...
listen to the grumbling of our estomacs !
that &apos;s not your estomacs !
it &apos;s some men speaking french !
now , i have work to do . complain to your papa .
papa ? he is no help at all .
marguerite , i leave to fight in flanders !
stupid flanders .
all tremble before the duc de springfield !
that &apos;s enough !
madame , i would like you
to weave me a tapestry with the following images :
me healing the sick .
me killing the healthy .
me marrying my sister .
a long winter where nothing happens .
me relaxing with friends .
you know , the standard stuff .
for this , i shall pay you two copper coins .
you have 25 years to complete it .
you may have one 15 @-@ minute dejeuner .
oh , these innocent creatures are blocking my path .
i could walk six paces that way ...
or i could kill them all right now !
i am heartily sorry and confess all my sins .
absolved !
avancez !
in their dying fury ,
those beasts began expelling demon wool .
and the restless spirits of those murdered sheep
compelled marguerite to loom ceaselessly ,
even as her husband went off to fight
again and again ...
and again .
as the years went by ,
the images she loomed were not of the duc ,
but rather depictions of the adventures
that cloth would experience over the centuries .
oh , and by the way ...
that tapestry was me .
right , and i was the gutenberg bible .
maman , we have failed to grow .
we &apos;ve had too little food !
is it too little food or too much complaining ?
maman , you are overstressed . you need a vacation .
perhaps to the south of france .
we &apos;re in the south of france !
one day , as rosy @-@ fingered dawn
wiped the morning gunk from her eyes ,
the duc came to claim his infernal drapes .
what an age for prosthetics we live in .
silence ! i have reached my verdict .
it &apos;s not what i expected .
and yet ... it &apos;s beautiful !
but it &apos;s also not what i expected .
burn down their house !
but le duc was about to be called home
to the worst kind of hell : medieval hell .
hey , let &apos;s show some french courage and beat up the corpse !
come on , ralphie , have a try .
oh ! we &apos;re submitting that
to france &apos;s funniest cave paintings .
even for a tapestry made of demon wool ,
this was hard to watch .
i was moved to a magnificent cathedral
and learned that tapestries
were the rock stars of the middle ages .
i had legions of what you now call groupies .
it felt like the good times
known as the dark ages would never end .
but then cruel fate knocked upon the door ...
guys , it ain &apos;t working-- the door &apos;s too strong .
go , vikings .
ow ! stop it !
you just broke your vow of silence .
it wasn &apos;t a vow . i just didn &apos;t want to talk to you .
this viking stuff is too dangerous .
i &apos;m going to become a gentleman art thief .
hmm , what the ... ?
spooky .
that was the first time i knew anguish and fear .
nothing will ever staunch the pain of that memory .
oh . well , that helps .
milhouse !
milhouse !
what do you--
what is it , bart ?
listen , um ... after our fight , i couldn &apos;t sleep .
well , i was doing fine .
warm glass of milk , some choice cuts from the wriggles
and i was out .
come on , man . at least listen to what i have to say .
okay ...
this is usually the part where you say you &apos;re sorry .
bart , i &apos;m not your puppet .
i know , i made you into a real boy last week .
and i &apos;ll always be grateful .
but it &apos;s time you started treating me with respect .
they &apos;re a tough pair , huh ?
if you let me in , i &apos;ll give you the heimlich .
so to recap : i had been unjustly torn
from my lofty perch .
i wound up as a barter in persia .
you have taken our gold
and jewels and given us this faded cloth ? !
that &apos;s right . and if anyone asked who swindled you ,
it was christians .
remember that name : christians .
i found myself in the court of the young persian king ,
a cruel king who demanded
constant entertainment from his wives .
throw her in the pit of boring wives .
we never go out anymore .
are you even listening to me ?
my sister has a much bigger pit .
dude , you &apos;ve already discarded , like , 500 wives .
i think it &apos;s weird that you &apos;re counting .
send in the next one !
good evening , your majesty .
may i tell you your slippers are as curly as everyone says ?
eh , pit her .
wait , wait , wait !
i can , uh , tell you a story !
cease your dragging !
uh ... there once was a boy named ali baba .
he and his elder brother cassim
were the sons of a merchant
who traded in camels and spices and--
okay , just a couple thoughts on your direction so far .
one day , while out for a walk ,
ali baba was set upon by a thief .
make that two thieves !
a million thieves !
too many .
forty thieves .
with her inventiveness and wit ,
the clever wife entertained her king
for a thousand and one nights .
and while he slept , she freed her imprisoned compatriots .
uh , it was cooler in the pit .
and that &apos;s how the camel got its hump .
another story !
for once , couldn &apos;t you just take
a few minutes to let the previous story sink in ?
you dare refuse your king ?
guards !
my downward spiral continued .
only cowards use blindfolds .
i didn &apos;t know you were doing that !
i was unfit for even the most sordid uses .
how &apos;s your neck , your lordship ? no splinters or nuffin &apos; ?
i fear the axe less than that filthy rag .
you talk fancy now , but you &apos;ll twitch like the rest .
all too true , i fear .
shut up !
your tongue is even sharper than your--
but then , at my lowest ebb , a moment of hope .
i played a pivotal role in creating
one of the masterpieces of western art .
michelangelo !
when will you be finished ?
hey , you want a quickie ? you go to raphael , baby .
the artist was never satisfied .
how about now ?
nope .
that &apos;s perfect !
now would you like to protect your investment
with a clear coat ?
hm , let me discuss it with my wife .
the masterpiece was finished
and so was the use for me .
and then ...
you know , moe , it might be time to buy a new bar rag .
yeah , yeah , sure thing . i &apos;ll get right on it .
no way i would abandon you , raggie .
you &apos;re my best friend .
so , i guess you didn &apos;t eat that &quot; special cheese &quot;
that i gave you yesterday , huh ?
oh , milhouse ,
what do i have to do , besides changing in any way ,
to get you to forgive me ?
gee , bart , you seem , uh-- how can i put it ?
milhousey .
really ? it &apos;s not that bad , is it ?
bart , you &apos;ll never learn .
&quot; milhouse , &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re the closest thing i have to a brother . &quot;
&quot; a brother with the wisdom of an older sister . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s why we squabble , &quot;
&quot; &apos; cause families always do . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , they &apos;re still a family . &quot;
&quot; what do you say ... brother ? &quot;
not bad . did lisa write that ?
yes , i did . now i &apos;m going to bed .
i want something that comes from you , bart. we &apos;re done here .
but @-@ but @-@ but ...
the glasses are off !
my degradation continued .
an enterprising seamstress
turned me into the flag of a fledgling nation .
unfortunately , a nation on the wrong side of history .
like everyone else , i was hit hard by the depression .
what &apos;s for dinner , ma ?
rag soup !
needs flavor .
mmm , that &apos;s better !
i was part of an expedition to the top of mount everest ,
one that had the distinction of failing un @-@ heroically .
oxygen ...
i need oxygen !
come on , man . a few more balloons
and this &apos;ll look really awesome .
worst ... climbing ... everest .
a yeti found me ,
and brought me home as a present to his son .
and now my thousand @-@ year fall from grace is complete .
i guess i should be happy here ,
with my sad , but predictable ...
moe ! moe ! wake up !
oh no , i don &apos;t want to find out what &apos;s worse than you !
milhouse !
i &apos;ve been out here all night , man .
just let me know what it &apos;ll take for you to forgive me .
can i punch you ?
sure .
can i have someone else punch you ?
sure . what &apos;ve you got ?
puppy goo @-@ goo coming my way ?
ay carumba !
i &apos;m glad it &apos;s over .
i wasn &apos;t comfortable having the upper hand .
from now on i &apos;ll dominate you in ways you don &apos;t realize .
that &apos;s all i ever wanted .
where &apos;d it go ? where &apos;d it go ?
hey , chief wiggum ! can you help me find my bar rag ?
i can &apos;t even find my car in the parking lot at the mall .
there was half a kilo of heroin and two suspects inside .
hey ! hey !
can you throw me my house key ? please !
it &apos;s got a green thingy on it !
stop !
hey , there &apos;s some pringles in here .
nope . tear gas .
haven &apos;t forgotten about your rag , moe !
i &apos;m in hell , i &apos;m in hell , i &apos;m in hell ,
i &apos;m in hell ...
perhaps one of you garments would like to narrate for a while .
men &apos;s extra large underwear ?
i &apos;m saving my strength .
he &apos;s going bike riding today .
come on in !
you &apos;ve got my rag ! but how ?
well , during the town meeting ,
which now seems like years ago ,
i forgot my purse at your bar .
and when i came back to get it ,
i saw how much you love that rag .
it seemed a little &quot; ripe , &quot;
so i brought it home to clean it for you .
thanks , marge .
that rag is my only friend in the world .
well , that &apos;s not true !
everyone in this family is your friend .
your bar is the closest thing this town has
to an algonquin roundtable .
what about that round table pizza run by that algonquin guy ?
yeah , yeah , okay , second closest .
so you &apos;s all like me ? even you , maestro ?
milhouse .
yeah , i , i knew it was something stupid .
well , thanks , everybody .
i ... i &apos;m always gonna remember today as the day
that i learned to open my heart to human beings
and not old pieces of cloth .
ha , crazy me , thinking i needed a rag for a friend .
so , this is how it ends .
the once magnificent tapestry tossed aside
yet again like a common kleenex .
good @-@ bye , cruel ... what the ... ?
in all my years ,
this is a love like i have never felt .
sweet , pure and forever .
well , all marriages have their ups and downs .
