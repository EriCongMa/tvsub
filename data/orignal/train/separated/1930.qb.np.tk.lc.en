&quot; only mama knows &quot;
also , with the laparoscopic common bile duct exploration ,
post @-@ op bile leaks and strictures
are significantly minimized .
it was called , at the time , an audacious technique .
and it was .
some context for you .
i was the only woman in my surgical residency program .
they called me &quot; girl &quot; and &quot; mrs. grey . &quot;
along with the one black male resident ,
i was clearly excluded .
they didn &apos;t want me to be a part of their boys &apos; club .
so i did the only audacious thing you can do
with an audacious technique .
i got myself published
in the journal of american medicine . &quot;
that caused an uproar .
a resident was not first author of a published paper .
but the truly audacious part came when they saw
what i named my technique
the grey method .
i put my own name on it .
you should have heard the boys roar about that .
the first time i won the harper avery ,
i dedicated it to the men who had been so supportive .
this is how my mother wanted to be remembered .
my memory of her is ... a little bit different .
where is the chief ? ! you &apos;re all amateurs !
complaining of intermittent cramping ...
what the hell are you doing here ? haven &apos;t i told you ?
how many times have i told you not to bother me
when i &apos;m at work ? !
i &apos;m sure everyone remembers their own version of her --
versions i wouldn &apos;t even recognize .
it &apos;s all that &apos;s really left of someone when they &apos;re gone .
no .
but that &apos;s the tricky thing --
meredith .
nobody &apos;s memory is perfect or complete .
mommy .
meredith , get up .
we jumble things up .
we lose track of time .
we are in one place ...
and another .
and it all feels like one long , inescapable moment .
it &apos;s just like my mother used to say --
the carousel never stops turning .
i spent the day with alex .
i needed a day , derek , so i took it .
that &apos;s fine . i just need to know why .
no , you don &apos;t .
you want to hear that i cured cancer
or that i found a vaccine for als before breakfast .
that &apos;d be great . anything would be great .
there it is again .
what ?
you &apos;re waiting for me to pay up
for this grand sacrifice that you made for our family .
how am i supposed to do anything with you pressuring me
and hovering over me for a decision that you made ?
and you &apos;re waiting for me to fail .
i &apos;m waiting for you to shine .
remember ? that &apos;s why you &apos;re staying here .
and i told you , you should go to d.c. and shine there .
it was you who decided to stay here and martyr yourself
and now make me feel guilty because of a decision you made .
well , i am done .
i &apos;m done feeling guilty ,
and i am done measuring my accomplishments against yours .
i won &apos;t do it anymore .
just stay out of my way .
wow . you sound just like your mother .
what happened to you ?
listen to me , meredith --
anyone can fall in love and be blindly happy ,
but not everyone can pick up a scalpel
and save a life .
i raised you to be an extraordinary human being .
so imagine my disappointment when i wake up after five years
and discover that you &apos;re no more than ordinary .
what happened to you ? !
this is crazy .
is has to stop .
i didn &apos;t hear you complaining a few minutes ago .
i heard something .
i wouldn &apos;t call it complaining .
we &apos;re gonna get caught .
we &apos;ve had so many close calls already .
is what we &apos;re doing so wrong ?
don &apos;t be naive .
seattle &apos;s a small city with a small @-@ town mentality .
so let &apos;s leave seattle .
richard , you deserve to be happy .
what ?
nothing .
just surprised to see you here .
i &apos;m working here .
what ?
nothing . that &apos;s great .
just , i thought bailey won the board seat .
she did .
they hired me back as a peds surgery attending .
oh ! that &apos;s great .
that &apos;s really good . that &apos;s awesome for you .
congratulations , man .
okay , you know what ?
shut it . i am a great surgeon .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re doing me a favor .
i &apos;m doing them a favor .
besides , robbins told me that board vote was very close .
okay . o @-@ of course .
what ?
nothing . just ...
i will assign you to impacted bowels for a month .
they &apos;ll call you &quot; pooper scooper . &quot;
robbins told bailey it was unanimous .
robbins .
ah , there you are . hey , welcome back .
can i talk to you ?
yeah . marty secord in 2313 --
his liver enzymes are looking good ,
but i &apos;m worried he might have to go back in for an ercp ,
so you make sure you keep an eye on it .
i hear you , dr. herman . give me two minutes .
god , you have no idea how lucky you were
to have me as a teacher during your fellowship .
we have to talk ... one minute .
my god , i am coming .
oh , no . no . bummer .
wait . maggie pierce is quitting ? !
i know . i &apos;m into it .
avery , tell me i &apos;m not losing another cardio chief .
i am into it , all right ?
my mother &apos;s already called me twice .
it &apos;s a p.r. nightmare .
she &apos;s damn right it is ...
first russell , then yang , now pierce ?
yang and i busted our asses interviewing people ,
and now i have to start this whole process over ?
well , evidently , because it looks like we hire from week to week .
we &apos;re a revolving door .
hey , you heard about pierce ?
uh , yeah , i just read the e @-@ mail .
well , what should we do ?
i don &apos;t see anything we can do .
well ... i mean , we should talk to her .
not me .
we-- okay , well , i didn &apos;t mean you !
i meant all of us !
we should get the whole board together ,
do a full @-@ court press .
uh , yeah , yeah . you spearhead that .
well , i will .
lucky for you , the board just got a transfusion of new blood .
maybe i could keep this place from looking like a clown car .
maggie pierce cannot quit .
you cannot quit .
uh @-@ huh . word &apos;s out . how you feeling , roy ?
i like this mattress .
i got to get me one of these .
mine is all foofy .
we will see what we can do .
what is this about you resigning ?
graft &apos;s deployed . let &apos;s inject the dye .
will you at least tell me why you &apos;re leaving ?
that is between me and my employer , dr. shepherd .
i &apos;m seeing diminished perfusion to the spine .
roy , wiggle your toes for me , would you , please ?
wiggle , wiggle , wiggle .
like that ?
wiggle a little harder .
let me check his babinski reflex .
when the toes fan out reflexively ,
what &apos;s that indicate ?
just what you &apos;re afraid of -- high spinal injury .
is he paralyzed ?
try it again .
s @-@ something &apos;s wrong ?
i can &apos;t feel my legs .
what &apos;s happening ?
roy , it &apos;s possible that the blood to your spine
has been cut off by the graft ,
but i &apos;m gonna do everything i can to fix it , okay ?
okay . please do . please .
i &apos;m gonna give you something to let you sleep .
start with trying to induce hypertension .
see if we can enhance spinal perfusion .
did you get maggie pierce &apos;s e @-@ mail ?
i did , yes .
are you going to talk to her again ?
she won &apos;t listen .
she doesn &apos;t trust me .
she &apos;s angry i didn &apos;t tell her sooner .
so am i.
i just still can &apos;t even remember my mother being pregnant .
i just -- i need that journal from the spring of &apos; 83 .
do you have that one ?
uh , yeah , i have them here .
i mean , we both looked at them a hundred times .
it &apos;s mostly surgical stuff .
can you just dig it out for me , please ?
okay .
help ! can you help , please ?
come with me .
what happened ?
i was just dropping my friend off when i saw her here .
she was lying -- she was all alone .
run inside and tell someone i need a gurney !
honey , i &apos;m a doctor .
what &apos;s your name ?
nadia .
nadia , tell me where it hurts .
everywhere .
oh , god .
this is insane . is she laboring ?
blood pressure &apos;s really low -- 78 over 45 .
let &apos;s get her a 600 cc fluid bolus .
nadia , nadia , how far along are you ?
10 .
10 months ?
she &apos;s saying she &apos;s 10 years old .
she doesn &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
rigid abdomen with generalized tenderness .
edwards , let &apos;s get the ultrasound .
nadia , where are your parents ?
if she has a mother , where the hell &apos;s her mother ?
well , she should be in prison .
nadia , i need you to sit still .
i know . i know .
i just need to see if ...
just needed to see ...
okay . okay .
what ?
she &apos;s not pregnant . it &apos;s not a baby .
looks like a mass , and there &apos;s free fluid .
oh , thank god . that was getting dark .
a mass the size of a soccer ball is still pretty dark .
okay , forget the c.t.
she &apos;s hypotensive with peritonitis .
this mass may have ruptured .
we really should get her up to the o.r.
i &apos;ll call up .
and then let &apos;s call the police and child protective services .
letting your kid get this sick and then abandoning her
is still child abuse .
okay .
amy , what do you need ?
on &quot; three . &quot; one , two , three .
looks like paralysis caused by s.c.i. during a tevar procedure .
i &apos;ve induced hypertension and adjusted the stent to alleviate ,
but nothing has worked .
he needs immediate spinal @-@ cord drainage .
you &apos;re here . why do you need me ?
i have stuff to do . i thought you could take it .
perks of being chief of neuro .
and this might be your last chance to work together .
i was just telling dr. pierce
why i thought her departure was such a bad idea .
i know , right ?
i thought , you &apos;ve been here longer than i have ,
you and meredith .
thought maybe you could talk about it .
derek &apos;s easy to talk to .
you can tell him anything -- anything .
gown and glove , please .
don &apos;t you have stuff to do ?
yes . good luck . good talk .
the journal of american medicine -- unbelievable .
what &apos;s not to believe ?
the method .
you &apos;re calling -- you actually named it the grey method ?
well , what else am i gonna call it ? it &apos;s my name .
it &apos;s a little ... audacious .
is that it ?
yeah .
spring of &apos; 83 .
is there anything in there ?
there &apos;s some surgical notes , ideas .
maybe you &apos;ll see something . i didn &apos;t .
i have a surgery . thanks for this .
we need to talk about maggie pierce .
bailey -- - the e @-@ mail said for professional and personal reasons .
now , you know what that could be ?
well , why would i ?
well , you talk to her .
bailey , she resigned .
we can &apos;t hold her against her will .
i &apos;m not saying that .
i &apos;m saying , we change her will .
i &apos;m trying to get the board together ,
but i think you need to talk to her
like you used to talk to me , you know , when i was first here
and i didn &apos;t know my ass from my elbow .
i probably would have quit --
damn it , bailey , she &apos;s leaving !
i can &apos;t do anything about it .
just let it go .
almost done draining , dr. shepherd .
you know , i &apos;m just curious --
speaking as someone who just had a pretty great job
and then turned it down ,
i know a rash decision can be pretty disastrous .
could we just call it a bad fit ?
we could if you &apos;d been here long enough to know that .
it &apos;s not the job .
then what is it ?
i &apos;m sure your wife has told you .
how we doing ?
my wife -- told me what ?
look , i know you two have butted heads
and she hasn &apos;t been welcoming .
to say the least .
she &apos;s just one surgeon .
why don &apos;t you just , you know , stay away from her
until you figure out -- - it &apos;s not as simple as --
oh , god .
you don &apos;t know ... anything .
i &apos;m sorry . what &apos;s going on ?
you should talk to your wife .
yeah , okay . let &apos;s get him on his back .
on &quot; three . &quot;
one , two , three .
derek , babinski reflex ?
damn it .
i &apos;m sorry , dr. pierce .
you did everything you could , but this man is paralyzed .
no .
nope . prep for a sternotomy .
i need a bypass machine in here , stat .
wilson , go get his wife &apos;s consent
for an open @-@ heart surgery .
what are you planning on doing ?
i am going to fix it .
you can help if you want , but if you &apos;re not gonna help ,
i need you out of the way .
mom ?
mommy ?
meredith ...
you grew up .
i did .
hmm . it &apos;s a shame .
it &apos;s awful being a grown @-@ up .
but the carousel never stops turning .
you can &apos;t get off .
you page me ?
what do you got ?
yeah .
do you remember the day you met my mom at the carousel ?
what ? that -- that &apos;s what you --
i remember this day .
i was on the carousel at the park and you came
and then you were arguing and she said something to you .
do you remember what she said ?
meredith , that was a long time ago .
i @-@ i don &apos;t remember .
is that all you wanted ?
yeah , i just thought ...
forget it .
i was thinking about what you said ,
and it might be better for them --
thatcher and adele -- ultimately .
of course it would .
let them find people who will make them happy .
i never wanted to --
i never wanted to cheat ...
never imagined myself a cheater .
you have the power to change that , richard .
it &apos;s in your hands .
i &apos;ve been ready to do this for a long time .
the question is , are you ?
the wife gave consent .
that &apos;s lucky . i &apos;ve been in his chest for a while now .
that was a bold bet .
wait . is -- is that an aneurysm sac ?
did you just fix that ?
yeah , but now i &apos;m gonna use it
to bring blood back to the spinal cord .
wait . i &apos;m lost .
yeah . i was , too , for a while .
he is paralyzed because his aorta
isn &apos;t sending blood to his spine .
so i replaced the aorta with a dacron graft ,
and now i &apos;m rebuilding the aneurysm into a second aorta
that will just send blood to the spine ,
kind of like a side road .
is that -- you can do that ?
not many could , but she is .
i can see why you want to keep her around .
well , yeah , and ...
never mind .
and it &apos;ll work ?
god knows .
it &apos;s a last @-@ ditch effort .
take me with you when you go .
suction . and get another 6 @-@ 0 of prolene ready .
well , don &apos;t just stand there , wilson . scrub in .
okay , the tumor has taken over the abdominal cavity .
it &apos;s pushed the viscera over to one side .
let &apos;s de @-@ bulk as much of this mass as we can , unblock ,
and when we get closer to the organs ,
we can resect it piece by piece .
fine .
what ?
edwards told me .
you guys were unanimous for bailey .
who told you that ?
dr. bailey .
why would she do that ?
i kind of had her back .
and you should have had mine .
you listened to my speech . you said it was good .
it was good .
then what the hell , then ?
bailey &apos;s was better .
well , that &apos;s great .
alex , you would make a fine board member ,
but bailey will make an exceptional one .
is that what you want me to do --
vote for you to be good , to be fine ?
you want my pity vote ?
i wouldn &apos;t .
have you lightened sedation ?
he is coming around .
want to do the honors ?
roy . roy , are you with us ?
roy , you &apos;re okay . the surgery is all done .
i just need you to wiggle your toes for me .
can you do that ?
roy , wiggle your toes , okay ?
roy , wiggle your toes .
unbelievable .
all right , get him sedated and get him up to recovery .
and good work , everybody .
thank you all .
she keeps saying talk to my wife .
do you know what she means ?
i might .
well ?
but i &apos;m not talking about anything
i might have learned in a.a. about someone ...
because i made a pledge there .
but someone else might know what i can &apos;t talk about .
is pierce in a.a. ?
no . no ! so you should definitely talk to her .
she &apos;ll just say talk to my wife .
then you should talk to your wife .
edwards , you ready ?
it &apos;s invading everything .
i &apos;m literally peeling it off the spleen .
and it &apos;s 7.8 pounds .
7.8 pounds of lousy parenting .
but she does have a dutch braid .
it &apos;s like a french one , but only harder to do .
i used to do it for my sister when my mom was strung out .
took me an hour , and it still fell apart .
only a saint or her mother
would take the time to do something like this .
you need an extra set of hands ?
no , we &apos;re good . thanks . metz ?
she takes the time to do her daughter &apos;s hair .
how the hell does she let her develop an 8 @-@ pound tumor ?
well , you and i know something about crazy mothers .
be careful . it &apos;s impinging on the left hepatic vein .
i see it .
damn it .
where are you ? where are you ? got it !
she &apos;s bleeding out from her liver .
i &apos;m packing , but i can &apos;t control it .
more laps . hang another unit of blood ?
right away .
edwards , more suction . i said clamp , now !
another . another .
one bullet went through the right lower quadrant
and perfed the colon . a penetrating injury to the liver here .
i need more laps !
she &apos;s crashing .
we got to stop this bleed . suction .
come on . come on !
bulky 4 @-@ 0 silk for ligation .
it &apos;s not working . we &apos;re gonna lose her .
what about a balloon tamponade ?
what ? a balloon tamponade .
that could control a penetrating liver injury .
it should .
yes . get me a foley catheter .
you might need more
more than one . i know .
foley -- now . let &apos;s go .
you think that &apos;ll hold the bleed ?
it &apos;s the best chance we &apos;ve got .
bulky clamp .
inflating the balloon .
i &apos;ll be damned .
nice work , dr. grey .
b.p. &apos; s climbing .
that &apos;s amazing .
how the hell did you think of that ?
i don &apos;t know .
you okay ?
she &apos;s fine . you saved her . she &apos;s -- she &apos;s fine .
yeah , i &apos;m okay .
there &apos;s never gonna be a good time .
we just have to do it quickly , rip off the bandage .
i &apos;ll tell adele ... tonight .
i &apos;ll tell thatcher .
my heart &apos;s racing . we &apos;re really gonna--
dr. grey ?
excuse me . one minute !
yes , chief ?
sorry , dr.grey.
um , i just received a very interesting phone call .
your lap method -- the one you just published .
the grey method .
the grey method , yes .
um , it &apos;s just been placed on the short list of nominations
for the harper avery award .
are y-- it is ? are you kidding ?
no surgical resident has ever made that list before .
i only hope we can , uh , convince you to stay in seattle ?
well , that &apos;s very ...
no , i know .
you &apos;ll have your veritable pick after this .
um , very well done , grey .
oh , the board would like to see you to , uh --
of course .
meredith .
derek , not now .
five minutes . just five minutes .
derek , i swear to god ,
i can &apos;t do this right now .
i am sorry about the thing i said about your mother .
why ? you meant it .
it was in the heat of the moment . i @-@ i just --
you know , you wanted to hurt me , and you did that ,
so at least have the guts to stand by it .
will you just hear me out ?
you could do worse than compare me to a brilliant surgeon ,
but you meant it in the sense that i am cold and ambitious
and selfish , a horrible wife and mother .
i got that .
well , i love how you just switch it around
so you can make it fit --
you think i sound like my mother ? you do .
and now i get to live
under the weight of your disappointment , too ?
because of something you gave up .
if you recall , i gave it up for you .
oh , you gave it up for me , but i don &apos;t want it .
go . you should get on the next flight out .
call the president and get the job back .
just go .
blood .
it &apos;s just blood .
meredith , don &apos;t be afraid . don &apos;t be afraid .
911 . what &apos;s your emergency ?
my mother tried to kill herself .
you &apos;re a very resourceful little girl .
you know that ?
you might have saved your mother &apos;s life .
someone from child protective services come here yet ?
he &apos;s right there .
you &apos;re still here .
yes . uh , i was just worried about the little girl .
is she okay ?
she &apos;s gonna be fine .
thank god .
child protective services is here for her , so ...
is that a dutch braid ?
when did she get sick -- your daughter ?
when did this start ?
i just want to see her . please
no , you can &apos;t see her ,
but you can come talk to child protective services with me .
no , i want to make sure she &apos;s okay .
and they are going to call the police .
no . no , you can &apos;t do that .
you don &apos;t understand .
we have no papers , undocumented .
that &apos;s no excuse to abandon your kid .
they will take her from me .
i &apos;ve seen it to people i know .
they go to sleep in a surgical room ,
they wake up in a plane or in a different country .
it &apos;s called medical repatriation ,
and it &apos;s not something that we do here .
i was afraid to even bring her here .
you think i didn &apos;t want to help her ?
what are my choices ?
they do the surgery .
then they send us back to a country where we starve
or or i will work as a prostitute , or even worse ,
they &apos;ll make her a prostitute ,
and no one says anything about it .
that is one choice .
the other choice is i ignore it and i pray
and i hope that she &apos;s okay
and i hope that whatever my little girl has goes away .
and after a while , these choices --
they make you crazy .
and after a while ,
i @-@ i say to myself that she &apos;s fine .
then after a while , i -- i don &apos;t see the tumor
when i look at her ...
because what is the alternative ?
yep ?
so , uh , you &apos;re leaving .
for sure ?
you should talk to your wife .
oh , no , that &apos;s , uh -- that &apos;s not an option .
so , i &apos;m asking you .
you know , i @-@ it &apos;s not really my place to say .
and , honestly , i &apos;m tired of saying it
&apos;cause every time i do , it just gets worse .
what ? what gets worse ? what are you talking about ?
she &apos;s my sister .
my parents , my birth parents ...
are ellis grey and richard webber .
your wife &apos;s my sister .
so you should talk to your wife .
that &apos;s -- so , richard &apos;s your father .
yes .
and meredith is your sister .
half @-@ sister .
i thought she would have told you .
oh , no , no , we &apos;re not , um --
uh , meredith is terrible with sisters ,
just so you know , and , uh , i @-@ i &apos;m not .
i love sisters . i have a bunch of them . and , um ...
i &apos;m glad you told me .
it &apos;s nice to meet you .
it &apos;s nice to meet you .
this is very strange .
yeah , i got to go .
okay , don &apos;t leave -- okay ?
until we talk again .
just ... don &apos;t leave .
okay , what is the deal with you and pierce ?
bailey , please .
see , every time i bring her name up to you ,
you look like i just stabbed you in the chest .
now , i think she &apos;s leaving because of you .
all right , you don &apos;t want to tell me what happened ,
you don &apos;t have to , but ...
did something happen ?
she &apos;s my daughter --
mine and ellis grey &apos;s .
oh , thank you , god .
what ? !
oh , no , no !
i @-@ i thought you had had sex with that girl .
bailey !
wait . but that &apos;s why she &apos;s leaving ?
she doesn &apos;t want anything to do with me .
well , then , she doesn &apos;t know you , or she would stay .
now , you have to go talk to her .
i think i &apos;m too late .
no such thing .
i wish i could go back .
i &apos;d do everything so differently .
we would &apos;ve had a wonderful life together , ellis .
you think so ?
i do .
we would &apos;ve done our fellowship here ,
and then you would &apos;ve fought me for chief
and probably won .
and ... i wouldn &apos;t have minded
because we &apos;d have the kids at home .
we have kids ?
meredith would &apos;ve needed a brother and sister .
kids need family .
i would be fine , and we could grow old together .
my life is so unfinished .
it &apos;s unfinished , and i &apos;m not finished .
no . no , ellis .
don &apos;t think that .
just close your eyes ...
... and think of the family ,
of the house ...
and you there every night to come home to .
and me there .
i lied to you before ...
about what happened that day at the carousel .
i remember what she said .
i remember what i said .
i remember everything .
it was a thursday afternoon .
we had made a pact --
she would leave thatcher , and i would leave adele .
your mother had just received
her first harper avery nomination .
she was so excited .
and i was ... jealous .
not like healthy competition .
a hateful , hopeless jealousy ...
as if she was already too far ahead to catch up to .
her success illuminated everything
i hadn &apos;t yet accomplished .
the night before ,
as i worked up the nerve to tell adele ,
i thought of your mother .
i thought of what she could do at such a young age .
i thought of what she would do .
and i thought ...
&quot; i will spend my life feeling like this ... &quot;
... &quot; my entire life . &quot;
so i ruined it .
you have a child .
don &apos;t say that . i won &apos;t listen , richard .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t .
no , please , please , please , please !
ellis , no .
richard ,
richard , you can &apos;t leave me .
richard ! richard !
richard !
are you okay ?
we have to go home . we have to go home .
we have to go home .
and then she took me home .
yes .
and then she attempted suicide .
we would have had a whole other life .
everything after that was my fault .
i made the wrong choice for the wrong reason .
and there &apos;s hardly a day goes by that i don &apos;t ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
i bet you are .
he &apos;s gone back to adele .
yes .
of course he has .
mom ...
he &apos;s afraid --
afraid to be happy .
and i &apos;m all alone .
now i have to raise my daughter alone .
how am i expected to do that ?
she &apos;s pretty skittish .
ana , we need to talk to you .
no . no , you said we will be all right .
it &apos;s okay . you &apos;re safe . calm down .
you can &apos;t take her from me .
i &apos;m going . i &apos;m go--
nadia is safe .
i spoke to cps .
i told them the whole thing was a huge misunderstanding
and that i made a mistake .
these people are lawyers from the hospital ,
and they are going to help you .
ana , they &apos;re gonna work with you , explain your rights ,
help with the payment plan .
no one &apos;s gonna deny nadia medical treatment ,
and no one &apos;s gonna take her away ,
but you have to bring her here to me for her treatments .
do you understand ?
okay , i &apos;m going to bring them in now .
no , no , no , i didn &apos;t vote for you .
like a month ago , you were all ,
&quot; tell me if you need help . i will help you . &quot;
so full of crap .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
if you didn &apos;t want to vote for me , fine ,
but then why lie to my face about it ?
because i didn &apos;t think that you &apos;d take the attending job if you knew .
look , if you &apos;re trying to be a mentor or whatever ,
right now you &apos;re sucking .
no , i &apos;m not your mentor !
i @-@ i mean , i am if you need me to be ,
but i need you to not need me to be .
that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t vote for you .
listen , i spent the day
observing a fetal shunt placement ,
trying to suck up to a woman
who i &apos;m 100 % positive hates me .
the only reason that i could even try to do that
is because you handled that little girl &apos;s case
so beautifully .
i need to take a step back from peds surgery
if i &apos;m gonna make this fellowship work ...
and if i &apos;m gonna keep my marriage from falling apart .
and the only way that i can even try to do that
is if -- is if you &apos;re here ,
doing everything that i can &apos;t do .
i don &apos;t need you to be my fellow anymore , alex .
i need you to be me .
you &apos;re the only one i can trust to do that .
i should be making a lot more money .
a lot . a lot .
ah , no , stop . stop .
we &apos;re not fighting . the fighting is over .
i am calling a halt to it .
god , derek , you don &apos;t just get to do that ,
decide when we &apos;re moving ,
decide when a fight is over .
what if i &apos;m not done fighting ?
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s not over . i can guarantee you that .
we &apos;ll probably fight tomorrow and the next day ,
and this is gonna last for a while ,
but right now we &apos;re gonna have a truce .
a truce ?
yes .
why ?
you have a sister .
you &apos;re losing her , meredith , and you shouldn &apos;t .
you have a sister and you don &apos;t tell me ?
this can &apos;t happen .
when stuff like this comes up , you have to let me know .
i -- we put all our other stuff aside , and it &apos;s like i --
i need to know that you &apos;re okay .
are you ?
are you okay ?
we have to go home .
would you like to hold her ?
no . absolutely not . no .
don &apos;t be afraid .
richard and ellis had a kid .
i remember moving to boston .
i remember the two of us
basically hiding out in an apartment .
and i remember she cried a lot .
and i member her belly getting big .
and i knew i wasn &apos;t supposed to make any noise .
and then her water broke on the kitchen floor ,
and that scared me because it reminded me
of the blood in the kitchen when she cut her wrists .
and i went to the hospital .
i was there ...
... both times .
and i heard a baby cry , and i heard my mother cry .
and then we went home .
and her belly wasn &apos;t big anymore .
and then we moved across town to a house ,
a really nice house .
and then she started her fellowship at mass gen ,
and i just started first grade .
and then she was just dr. ellis grey
and i was just a kid in school
and everything went back to normal .
i mean , i was 5 years old .
what -- what was the alternative ?
and i have a sister .
she &apos;s nice . good doctor .
you remind me of my daughter .
pierce .
do you have a second ?
yeah . listen --
you didn &apos;t ask for a sister ,
and you probably don &apos;t need one .
your parents send you singing fish .
you &apos;re very accomplished for your age ,
and you seem very happy .
so , you can go if you want .
i can understand why you would want to .
but i would like to show you something
if you have a minute .
they say we can repress our memories .
i wonder if we &apos;re just keeping them safe somewhere ...
she wrote in these journals , obsessively ...
mostly surgical notes , ideas ,
but this one is from around the time you were born .
&quot; a surgery can fail for any number of reasons ,
&quot; whether from a patient &apos;s morbidity
or surgeon &apos;s ineptitude . &quot; geez .
they &apos;re not so warm .
she wasn &apos;t , either .
but there is more to her than ...
i &apos;m still finding out things about her myself .
... because no matter how painful they are ,
they are our most valuable possessions .
our lives are built on our mistakes
as much as our successes .
she wrote mostly at night ,
with a glass of wine , as you can see by the ...
ring stains and --
but i think here is when she found out
she was pregnant because the wine stains stop
and she starts writing down everything she ate .
so ...
this was when she ...
realized she was pregnant with you .
so she wanted you to be okay .
she wanted to be healthy .
she tried , at least .
they made us who we are .
the first time i won the harper avery ,
i dedicated it to the men who &apos;d been so supportive .
no , i wish . just kidding .
the first time i won the harper avery ,
i thought , &quot; screw all those boys . &quot;
i stood there , holding that trophy ,
and i thought about everything i &apos;d sacrificed ,
what i had overcome .
and i dedicated that award
to all the women surgeons who would come after me .
where were we ?
