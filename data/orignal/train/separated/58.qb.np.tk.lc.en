28,000 feet , 73 @-@ mile @-@ an @-@ hour winds .
the south col.
500 climbers all crowding the same route
in the one three @-@ week period .
it &apos;s a nightmare on everest .
that &apos;s hillary step .
i shot this just below the summit .
there &apos;s always a bottleneck waiting to use the ropes .
and that &apos;s where robert lambros died ?
yes .
and that &apos;s his body there ?
yes . he was a guide .
one of the members of his party collapsed
and died above hillary step ,
and bobby stayed to help , and then succumbed , too .
i &apos;m sorry .
i liked your brother .
you okay ?
now , regarding his book--
the defendant &apos;s book-- have you read it ?
i have .
in it , he claims that my client , mr. oliver cardiff ,
came upon the dying robert lambros , and not only
stepped over his body to get to the summit ,
but then took his bottled oxygen .
you &apos;re aware of that accusation ?
i am .
and do you disagree ?
i do . i was
climbing everest for a documentary ,
and i saw mr. cardiff here
climbing with a british team .
and this is below the hillary steps ?
uh , step .
yes .
so , mr. cardiff couldn &apos;t have been near lambros .
he was lower on the mountain , heading up
yes , that would follow .
so , this book is untrue ?
well , i hate to question another climber ,
danny was at base camp and didn &apos;t see what i saw .
no further questions .
nothing personal , but i have to rip your friend apart .
be gentle .
mr. branch , what is the death zone ?
the death zone ?
in mountaineering parlance ,
it &apos;s the altitude above 26,000 feet
where oxygen is insufficient to sustain life .
it &apos;s also a place where perceptions are not to be fully trusted ?
sometimes .
you believe
that bottled oxygen has hurt the sport of mountain climbing ,
so you climb with out oxygen ?
i do .
and an absence of oxygen would increase the likelihood
of untrustworthy perceptions ?
yes .
so , when you say
that you saw the plaintiff below the hillary step ,
we have to take your word for it ,
and yet your word could be colored
by your oxygen @-@ deprived perception .
i believe ... that follows .
your honor , i &apos;d like to make motion
at this time to dismiss this lawsuit .
this is a libel suit , not a criminal case .
the plaintiff needs not only to prove
that my client &apos;s book was wrong , but at he knew it was wrong .
which we &apos;re doing .
no .
there is too much inherent uncertainty here .
this is a case built on perception , and
the death zone makes those perceptions essentially suspect .
wow . he dismissed .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m stunned .
me , too .
thank you .
the thought of him leaving my brother behind and then
suing me for everything ...
i know . it &apos;s over .
hi , eli . where are you ?
the meeting &apos;s in ten minutes .
and what meeting was that again ?
okay , don &apos;t tease . i &apos;m not the mood .
i &apos;m heading back there now . in 30 minutes .
mickey , there you are .
any trouble ?
no .
took the elevator to the 31st floor ,
walked on down , no nobody saw me .
you look like crap .
thanks . this way .
who was that ?
no idea .
do you ever get the feeling we &apos;re losing control here ?
every day .
the state &apos;s attorney can hire any law firm he wants
to handle all civil cases against his department .
glenn childs had brimly , tully &amp; snider .
god , i hated them .
peter florrick fired them and is looking for new outside counsel .
it &apos;s 20 $ million a year in new business .
florrick will never hire us .
it &apos;s his wife &apos;s firm ,
his campaign manager &apos;s firm .
which works against us .
he doesn &apos;t want it to look like a sweetheart deal .
we &apos;ve been invited in to pitch .
how many firms have been invited ?
eight .
then you should pitch .
we should pitch .
no .
is there something i should know ?
about ?
i just don &apos;t want to be blindsided .
have you noticed you &apos;re turning into me ?
all the sports metaphors .
a better version of you .
how the hell is it
i can love a new car smell but hate a new office one ?
the car means fun ,
and an office , work .
you getting laid , anyways ?
me ?
no . you ?
not since the summer of &apos; 08 .
so , you &apos;re the flavor of the month these days
in crisis managers .
what happened with weiner ?
与赌城发牌女郎调情 引起轩然大波 已辞职
thought you &apos;d be on that one .
oh , god , the day politicians discovered twitter ...
i hear you &apos;re the flavor of the month in strategists .
what campaign are you on ?
i need your help .
but i can &apos;t tell you who this help is for .
okay . i &apos;ve been hired by
a candidate who &apos;s setting up an exploratory committee .
for what ?
i can &apos;t tell you .
but he &apos;s got a problem .
a real problem .
financial or sexual ?
uh , i can &apos;t tell you .
oh , come on , mickey .
you want me to crisis manage a crisis you can &apos;t tell me ?
this guy wants options , okay ?
he wants to know this scandal can be handled
if he chooses to run , but he doesn &apos;t want the scandal
to get out if he chooses not to run .
this is bs .
it &apos;s a bake @-@ off without any ingredients .
buyer &apos;s market , eli .
if you choose not to play , there are others who will .
now , i &apos;m meeting with three crisis managers .
whoever has got the best play , that &apos;s who we &apos;re going with .
alicia , i &apos;d like you to meet a good friend , mickey gunn .
yeah , i get it . you got saint alicia our on your team .
i &apos;ll heard from you by thursday , buddy .
hi .
that was the big meeting ?
who &apos;s the investigator here ?
kalinda sharma . why ?
i need her to investigate a scandal before it happens .
mrs. florrick .
hello .
hi .
are you here to see someone ?
yes , you .
james thrush .
very please to meet you .
and you .
how may i help you ?
do you know the key distinction
between the libel laws our in your country and mine ?
burden of proof is reversed .
in america , it is up to the person libeled
to prove the accusations against them are either
knowingly or recklessly false .
in england , it is up to the person libeling--
your writing client , mr. lambros--
to prove what he says is true .
this is already adjudicated , mr. cardiff .
yes . in the united states .
danny didn &apos;t sell any books in england .
actually , i &apos;m afraid he did .
this , in fact , is one .
purchased not two weeks ago
from your wonderful internet site , amazon .
you can &apos;t ...
actually , i &apos;m afraid i can .
i am a queen &apos;s counsel of the royal courts of justice ,
and this is a writ of new proceedings for libel .
you had this ready for the day you lost .
mr. cardiff wished to exhaust the american courts first .
you &apos;re going after the wrong man-- danny did nothing wrong .
he accused me of killing his brother .
he ruined my reputation .
read the charge .
i am suing him for 20 million pounds .
he &apos;s not rich . he doesn &apos;t have your money .
oh , let &apos;s not make this a classist issue , shall we ?
i know he &apos;s not rich .
now he &apos;ll be poor .
mr. ash brannon ?
so sorry to keep you waiting .
i &apos;m alicia florrick .
yes . hello . sorry .
florrick ? right . two rs ?
yes . right .
come with me .
certainly .
filial airrock .
excuse me ?
an anagram .
sorry . it &apos;s a nervous habit . sorry .
okay .
so you are the barrister that danny hired .
沙律师地位较低 负责分组案件起诉和辩护等事务性工作
is that correct ?
actually , no . the solicitor .
not as posh as a barrister , but we try harder .
sorry , i &apos;m a bit punchy .
just , uh , first trip to the states .
you know , just off the plane .
where are the olsen twins ?
would you like a cup of coffee ? will !
this is mr. timothy ash brannon .
oh , yes , the barrister . will gardner .
actually , solicitor . no , thank you on the coffee .
oh , okay .
warden grill .
有虐囚监狱长之意
anagrams .
it &apos;s not a deposition .
it &apos;s a letter rogatory .
and that &apos;s ?
well , basically , it &apos;s a , uh ...
it &apos;s a deposition .
evidence given before a trial .
the witnesses are primarily in america ,
so his lordship has agreed to allow it to be videotaped here .
good , then we try to get this kicked before trial .
or we stall it .
stall what ?
cardiff doesn &apos;t need the money from this suit .
he wants the publicity . that &apos;s why he &apos;s expediting this .
so ? we can &apos;t just sit back .
we get this kicked , there won &apos;t be any publicity .
but the burden of proof works against us now .
we would have to prove that danny &apos;s book is true .
which we can &apos;t do .
we can &apos;t stall .
my wife &apos;s house-- it &apos;s in toronto .
my business , too .
canada is a british commonwealth .
they froze your assets ?
yes .
what was your strategy in court ?
show there could be no certainty about the events on everest .
therefore , there could be no libel .
well , that strategy just went out the window .
what do we have ?
to prove cardiff took lambros &apos;s oxygen ?
well nothing . the goal wasn &apos;t to prove it .
can we , though ? can we prove it ?
what about the satellite call ?
robert talked to his wife
from his satellite phone just before he died .
we never needed the tape .
i &apos;m on it .
are you the investigator ?
i am .
do you have a minute ?
do you want me to have a minute ?
so there &apos;s a scandal of some kind ,
but you don &apos;t know who or what it is ?
yes . can you find out ?
how does this work when i investigate for you ?
i have no idea .
but you are one of my bosses now ?
yes . i think so .
you probably invoice in some way .
i have to pitch to a campaign manager
on thursday on how to manage a scandal ,
but he &apos;s afraid the scandal will be exposed ,
so he won &apos;t give me any information ,
and i need that information to pitch .
do you want to sit down ?
no .
you want the information so he &apos;s forced to hire you ,
or you &apos;ll expose it ?
how have i never met you before ?
we move in different circles .
sorry about that .
it &apos;s amazing how my life has gone from no calls
to a call sheet of 85 a day .
yes , it &apos;s quite a change--
from prison back to the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
how you doing ?
i love it . i really love it .
you don &apos;t mind if cary sits in on this , do you ?
no , not at all .
hi , cary .
diane .
he gives me insight into all the lockhart / gardner matters .
so you guys are the survivors .
of the economy .
i looked at the roll of chicago firms
since i was last in this seat .
they &apos;re practically all gone .
well , there &apos;s been some tough times , but we &apos;re fighters .
well , you &apos;ve beaten us a few times .
no hard feelings ?
hey , that &apos;s the reason you &apos;re in that seat .
we &apos;re hiring an outside caretaker for our civil cases--
lawsuits against county hospital , the police
or sa &apos;s office--
and we need to decide between three firms .
really ? i thought there were eight .
there were . we whittled it down .
i &apos;m honored .
the only problem is , we have some concerns .
if it &apos;s about alicia and eli gold ,
we &apos;ve established a chinese wall between their work
and sa business .
no , no , no .
i &apos;m not going to reject a law firm
because it might look bad to the public .
lemond bishop .
the drug dealer .
we only handle his legitimate business .
and i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll find that every major law firm
has a few potentially unsavory clients .
we have to have some assurances that your money isn &apos;t tainted .
is that a fair word ?
it is .
diane , look , i &apos;m running a new office ,
and i know that every state &apos;s attorney says that--
i said it my first term--
but this time , it &apos;s different .
now , you &apos;re one of three law firms that i &apos;m considering
to hire as my attorney .
i need to know that you &apos;re clean .
so we just need you to voluntarily submit
to an audit by the illinois state department of taxation .
and that won &apos;t violate attorney @-@ client privilege .
it gives me an independent confirmation
that your hands are free of drug money .
you &apos;re asking us to voluntarily submit to an audit ?
yes . if you want the job .
well , uh , that &apos;s significant .
i &apos;ll need to talk to my partner .
of course .
will ?
yes .
you two know each other , don &apos;t you ?
we do .
why don &apos;t you bring him in next time ,
and we &apos;ll all talk about the possibility
of , uh , making this all work ?
86th call .
if you &apos;ll excuse me .
yeah .
hey , dad . i &apos;m coming over early tomorrow night .
8 : 00 , okay ?
okay .
is everything all right ?
yeah , everything &apos;s fine .
i just wanted to come early .
okay , good . well , i &apos;ll make dinner .
well , thanks for the vote of confidence , zach .
i think it might be appropriate to respond , &quot; good morning . &quot;
i understand the arguments for &quot; good evening , &quot;
but the court of record is in london ,
not in the united states .
and as you can see ,
it is morning here .
your lordship , i will gladly defer .
good morning to all .
and good evening to you , mr. thrush .
who is the barrister representing the responder ?
a solicitor , your lordship .
uh , one timothy o &apos;brannon .
brannon , your lordship .
no &quot; o. &quot;
mr. brannon ,
are there any applications
to the court before we commence ?
there are , your honor .
uh , your lordship .
your lordship .
this is a sham of a lawsuit .
it &apos;s libel tourism , pure and simple .
rich plaintiffs like roman polanski ,
于是转而出国躲避
arnold schwarzenegger and mr. cardiff
can &apos;t win their libel suits in american courts ,
so they take them to england .
sir , i understand your passion in this matter ,
but i would ask you to address this court
with a greater degree of restraint .
i ...
apologies , your ...
lordship .
lordship .
that might be an artifact of the polycom .
i merely wanted to stress that
there were only 18 copies of our client &apos;s books
sold in the united kingdom .
they were all bought online ,
and they were all bought by mr. cardiff &apos;s staff .
as my learned colleague well knows , your lordship ,
where and who purchased these books is irrelevant .
excuse me . mr. cardiff bought the books
that he is now bringing suit to here .
mr. gardner , what are you doing ?
what am i doing ?
your body .
the disposition of your body .
you turned your back to the judge .
are you kidding me ?
ok , maybe you should let me argue ...
apologies , apologies , your lordship .
i am ... i am new to your court .
we would argue that your parliament
is in the midst of rewriting these libel laws
to prevent exactly this type of libel tourism .
your lordship , parliament was indeed considering
revising these very laws until mr. rupert murdoch
and his recent news of the world contretemps .
i would argue that only 23 copies
of funding evil were purchased through the internet ,
yet this court ordered that book &apos;s destruction ...
i think you &apos;d better argue instead .
the judge likes demure .
mr.thrush made fine point , we &apos;ll continue .
if i may , your lordship .
yes , mr. o &apos;brannon .
uh , brannon , your lordship .
we ask the court &apos;s indulgence
in hearing evidence intended to refute the applicant &apos;s charge .
proceed .
i love you .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s so cold .
bobby , do me a favor
just get up .
you can do it .
please .
i &apos;m just so tired ..
i know .
your son needs you , bobby .
he &apos;s here .
he needs his father . so get up and walk .
and this is your husband ?
yes .
he had a satellitehone. he called from the south col.
he always called at noon .
and you recorded that .
yes .
i wanted his son to remember him .
use the oxygen , bobby . please .
and get up and walk .
over here ! here !
is someone there ?
bobby !
it &apos;s the british team .
hold on .
but they didn &apos;t stop for him .
and they took your husband &apos;s oxygen tank .
yes . i asked him to use his oxygen tank ,
but it was gone .
no apology , no money .
but we &apos;ll agree not to print the book in great britain .
very emotional in there .
nice touch using the female lawyer .
you americans certainly do enjoy your drama .
so does his lordship.did you see him ?
1.2 million pounds and an apology .
so is this some of that famous
stiff @-@ upper @-@ lip stuff i &apos;ve heard about ?
god , i do love you yanks .
you are so easy to distract .
with our accents
and our periwigs and our tea and crumpets .
and benny hill . don &apos;t forget benny hill .
but i am not the england of big ben and bobbies .
i &apos;m not the england of doilies and cucumber sandwiches .
i &apos;m the england of football hooligans
and jack the ripper .
and this england don &apos;t play nice , and it don &apos;t play fair ,
and it don &apos;t ever stop .
here &apos;s some advice , mr. , uh ... thrush .
when you want to intimidate someone ,
don &apos;t use so many words .
intimidation isn &apos;t a sonnet .
it seems we understand each other perfectly .
shall we ?
mrs. lambros ,
you used to be a mountaineer yourself ?
yes , until i became pregnant .
and why did you stop then ?
why ? i couldn &apos;t risk it with a son .
yes , of course .
your husband kept climbing after you gave birth ?
yes . he was a guide . it was his job .
but he was offered other
climbing jobs on less dangerous peaks .
in the alps , for instance .
don &apos;t need to answer that . we understand .
tell me about hypoxia .
uh , hypoxia is an extreme form
of oxygen deprivation prevalent at high altitudes .
thank you . now , isn &apos;t one of the potential
side effects of hypoxia hallucinations ?
potentially .
mrs. lambros , i put it to you that your husband
was hallucinating on that telephone call .
i put it to you that your husband
saw what he wished to see--
the british team coming to save him .
oh , come on .
you &apos;re kidding me .
i beg your pardon .
you really think that robert lambros hallucinated
cardiff taking his oxygen tank ?
really ? how does that work ?
i think , my l ...
your lordship , i ...
no , seriously , how does he hallucinate
the loss of his oxygen tank ?
it was my contention that he
hallucinated its existence in the first place .
if you &apos;re going to blame the victim ,
at least use some better logic .
your lordship , i object to the tone that this ...
this what ?
this american lawyer ? is that what you were going to say ?
let us take a short break .
demure , huh ?
change of plans .
i think i &apos;m having american revolution fantasies .
that turned me on .
well , i can dress up .
i want to take you now .
well , that might prove difficult .
in my bathroom .
we have ten minutes .
i &apos;ll go first .
oh , will , we &apos;re being watched .
where is that book ? hmm ...
to be continued .
we can &apos;t do that .
i know .
he said it was about lemond bishop .
they wanted to make sure none of our billing
came from drug money .
it &apos;s like putting a bull &apos;s @-@ eye on our back for the irs .
i know .
do you think he &apos;s after us ?
florrick ?
i don &apos;t know .
glenn childs was this close to a rico charge .
maybe florrick &apos;s taking up the hunt .
you really think he would do that to his wife &apos;s firm ?
i think he &apos;s trying to run a clean office .
what if we offer to open up our books
to an independent accounting firm ?
florrick might just be looking for a gesture like that .
i think if he &apos;s serious , it &apos;s worth a try .
but let &apos;s not expose ourselves on a subway platform
unless we have to .
well , what a colorful and pointless metaphor .
thank you .
it &apos;s the brits .
i think i &apos;m picking up their accents .
i noticed .
it really classes up the joint .
and here &apos;s mr. gunn meeting outside of his office .
and here ... is the suv license plate .
here it is driving away .
and here is the occupant .
harold burke ?
yup .
ex @-@ senator .
here &apos;s a photo of him with his family .
any whiff of a scandal ?
here &apos;s the children &apos;s nanny .
you &apos;re kidding .
here &apos;s a photo of her leaving work .
here &apos;s a photo of mr. burke leaving work .
and here is a photo of them ...
... at their destination .
nicely done .
thanks .
how do i know you ?
you don &apos;t .
and yet , you look so familiar .
i just have one of those faces .
i &apos;ll need you again .
then invoice .
hey , grace , set the table , please .
dad .
yeah ?
why is mom doing this ?
doing what ?
kicking you out .
we were just getting back to normal .
i don &apos;t get it .
what did your mom tell you ?
she said that she wanted to make the marriage work ,
but it didn &apos;t .
you don &apos;t kick someone out for no reason .
i wasn &apos;t always good to your mom , zach .
but that was a long time ago .
and she stayed .
it wasn &apos;t just ...
there were other things .
what do you mean ?
i mean ...
i hurt your mom with other things .
with someone else ?
i think we should just leave it at that .
dad , there &apos;s something wrong with the computer .
okay . let &apos;s have a look .
so where are you from , mr. brannon ?
i &apos;m sorry , where am i from ?
yes . county cork ? county clare ?
tipperary ?
have a bit of an ear for accents .
i &apos;m just trying to place your irish brogue .
county kerry .
a bit of the old potato famine emigration , was it ?
well , fair play , lad .
and good luck to you , me boy .
what &apos;s his anagram ?
jams her tush .
there is this inbred deference i have to greater rank .
yeah , i know . me , too .
really ? you don &apos;t seem so .
i &apos;m trying very hard to change .
i &apos;m not well @-@ disposed to change .
no , me neither .
mandy cox .
i am a music executive working in a &amp; r.
thank you , ms. cox .
and you were intending to summit everest
at the same time as the events in question ?
yes , sir .
it &apos;s always been a dream of mine .
everest . my mountain .
i &apos;ve paid two guides over the past two years to get me to the top .
and you observed mr. cardiff on the south col ,
is that correct ?
yes .
our sherpa was injured in an icefall the day before ,
and mr. cardiff was kind enough to share one of his with us
for the final assault .
so you made the last assault on everest with mr. cardiff ?
my goodness , that was not mentioned in mr. lambros &apos;s book .
there were a lot of things not in danny &apos;s book .
many of us in the climbing community
were outraged at the many distortions .
did you ever see mr. cardiff step over a body ,
or take anyone &apos;s oxygen tank ?
of course not . as far as i could tell ,
he was the perfect gentleman .
thank you , ms. cox .
ms. cox , were you sleeping with mr. cardiff at base camp ?
if i may interrupt . i might suggest to my learned colleague
that these news of the world type smear tactics
are beneath the dignity of the court .
i would tend to agree , mrs. florrick .
i &apos;m sorry .
please move on .
we need to find another way to shake her .
yes , but unfortunately , the judge agreed with her .
i know . where &apos;s kalinda ?
this is my associate , kalinda sharma .
she &apos;s been helping me prepare for this meeting .
and these are my associates .
i don &apos;t know their names , but they &apos;re very expensive .
so let &apos;s hear it , eli .
three @-@ day plan .
day one , i meet your candidate .
i tell him that scandals are owned by the first man in .
breitbart owned the weiner scandal .
if weiner had released those tweets with his spin ,
he would still be in office today .
day two , i don &apos;t ask your candidate to tell me everything ,
because candidates lie .
i &apos;m falling asleep here , eli .
but i do tell him we have to get the nanny &apos;s story straight
so that she doesn &apos;t hop off to the national enquirer .
day three , we acknowledge there is some entertainment value
in a father of three sleeping with his nanny .
and the goal is not to smother that value , but to harness it .
that &apos;s very interesting .
thank you .
only problem is it ain &apos;t burke .
burke asked me to run his campaign , but i said no .
and that &apos;s what you saw when you accidentally followed me .
you &apos;re lying .
no , i &apos;m not .
and here &apos;s the thing-- come on , you follow any candidate ,
you &apos;re gonna find a nanny , a hooker ,
a mistress or an intern .
but thanks for the pitch , buddy .
i &apos;ll see ya .
give me one more chance .
i &apos;m deciding monday .
there are no other candidates .
i checked .
they all have strategists already .
unless we go local .
nah , nah , he &apos;s a national kind of guy .
he may have gone with someone new ,
but why pick a rotten apple from the tree ?
maybe it &apos;s a celebrity .
no . i can &apos;t see him tolerating that .
what ?
i get it .
he &apos;s flipping sides .
it &apos;s a republican .
he wanted to play in the presidential primaries .
i &apos;m on it .
mazel tov .
thank you for returning , ms. cox .
no problem .
before you went on your climb to everest ,
did you have any surgery performed ?
no .
what do you mean ?
i mean , did you have any surgery performed ?
no .
what do you mean , like an appendix out ? no .
or lasik surgery ?
oh . yeah .
no , i @-@ i thought you meant ,
like , major surgery .
yeah , lasik .
that was a while ago .
i had contacts for farsightedness ,
and i didn &apos;t want to deal with them on the mountain .
good .
and did you know that lasik reacts poorly
to decreased atmospheric pressure ?
i ...
i don &apos;t ...
what are you asking ?
i &apos;m asking if you knew that .
no .
the vision of lasik patients
becomes blurry at high altitudes in the weeks following surgery ,
due to decreased atmospheric pressure .
was your vision blurry , ms. cox ?
no .
isn &apos;t that why you had mr. cardiff &apos;s sherpa carry you
the last thousand feet up everest ?
that &apos;s a lie .
people keep saying that , but i wasn &apos;t carried .
your lordship , this is a sworn affidavit from
tenji gelu , the sherpa in question .
now , he swears that ms. cox had blurry vision
and could not have seen
any of the events in question .
he &apos;s lying .
he was always lying .
he hated me because i accused him
of stealing my satellite phone .
your lordship , given the circumstances ,
we ask that ms. cox be removed
from the claimant &apos;s witness list .
i would regretfully agree .
i got it .
oh , no , that &apos;s okay .
mom , i got it .
are you okay ?
what , because i &apos;m cleaning ?
yes .
you have work .
i thought i &apos;d let you do it .
oh , you are so adorable .
oh , come on .
you know it &apos;s gonna happen , so just let it happen .
mm . good . thank you .
how &apos;s dad ?
he &apos;s good .
are you good with him ?
am i ?
mm @-@ hmm .
yeah .
i mean , you know .
what ?
do you think i &apos;m like him ?
do i think you are ?
no .
really ?
you &apos;re different .
very different .
why ?
i just wanted to know .
i &apos;ll get it .
diane .
yes .
i &apos;m sorry , alicia . i &apos;m here ... um ...
i &apos;m trying to get in touch with peter ,
and the office said he was at home .
uh , well , no , he &apos;s @-@ he &apos;s not here .
i &apos;m so sorry , alicia .
i would , i would never do this to you ,
but do you have a minute ?
we &apos;re competing with two other law firms
for the state &apos;s attorney civil business .
it would be very lucrative , as you know .
but peter &apos;s asked that we be audited
by the department of taxation .
and that-- well , that would be quite invasive .
grace , i &apos;ll be there in a minute .
how old ?
fourteen .
that &apos;s a sweet age .
anyway , i @-@ i suggested to the state &apos;s attorney
that we use an independent auditor ,
but he insisted on a departmental audit .
and that would open up our books
in an alarming way .
um , i &apos;m not sure i ...
i checked with the two other law firms under consideration ,
and they have not been asked to do the same .
so i was wondering ,
is there something i should know
about why peter &apos;s only asking us ?
diane , i &apos;ve worked hard
to keep my home life separate from my work life .
i know , and i respect that .
but i need to know if peter is doing the same .
i don &apos;t know how to answer that .
well , let me ask you this .
if you were assisting me in this decision ,
how would you advise ?
agree to the audit or not ?
i would advise you not to .
uh , you really have a very lovely apartment , alicia .
thank you .
take two .
morning .
so , let &apos;s hear what you got .
actually , ms. sharma and i discussed it ,
and we &apos;ve decided to pass on your polite offer to pitch .
but thank you .
you &apos;re kidding me , right ?
nope . but thanks .
i mean , what the hell is that ?
don &apos;t you think you could &apos;ve told me that over the phone ?
i could &apos;ve , but that would &apos;ve taken up less of your time .
go to hell .
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t like being used .
what are you talking about ?
how did i use you ?
you &apos;re considering joining a republican presidential campaign .
no comment .
but the guy &apos;s too clean .
you can &apos;t find a single thing wrong with him .
he &apos;s too good to be true .
i don &apos;t know who you &apos;re talking about .
okay .
and ?
and you didn &apos;t have the money to vet him ,
so you hinted that you wanted to hire me
so i would vet him for you .
poor man &apos;s crawfishing .
you let the tourist set the bacon trap ,
and then you go in and raid them .
yeah , mickey , uh , tell me the last time
you were in the bayou .
so cut the trapper john crap , okay ?
oh , you going to offend me now ?
oh , yeah . i &apos;m just getting started .
okay .
what did you find out ?
no .
come on .
i &apos;ll hire you .
no , here &apos;s how it works .
you first offer your services to your republican ,
then you hire me .
i already did . he hired me .
nope . he &apos;s had two meetings ,
but he hasn &apos;t jumped yet .
go get hired .
and you &apos;ll work for a republican ?
i don &apos;t mind this guy . he &apos;s not bad .
okay .
i &apos;ll call you tomorrow .
no hard feelings , right ?
go .
hey . it &apos;s business .
go !
all right . i &apos;ll see you .
i &apos;ll be calling on you again .
it &apos;s your dime .
mr. cardiff , good evening .
actually , good morning .
yes .
of course . good morning .
a year before you climbed everest , mr. cardiff ,
you successfully summited the trango towers in pakistan .
is that correct ?
trango ii , to be exact .
trango ii .
you came upon a team
of japanese mountaineers during that climb , did you not ?
let &apos;s see . it &apos;s , uh ... it &apos;s been so long .
in fact , you not only came upon them ,
you took the ropes and pitons
from a dying japanese climber .
if i may quickly ask my learned colleague
to which materials he is referring here .
the book , only in may , the account
of a french climbing expedition to the trango towers .
yes , that was my worry .
your lordship , mr. cardiff previously brought suit--
brought successful suit--
against the publisher of that very book .
it has been deemed libelous and therefore
cannot be mentioned in these proceedings .
well , then , let me ask you this .
in that expedition--
the one that i was just talking about ...
apologies for interrupting again , your lordship ,
but as part of the successful suit against the aforementioned book ,
mr. cardiff instigated a superinjunction ,
which , of course , means not only are we prevented
from discussing the book here ,
we are prevented from even discussing
the supposed events alluded to in that book .
oh , come on .
even the request by my learned colleague here
must be stricken from the record .
it is as if the book and its events ,
and even events questioning the events , never happened .
unless , of course ,
it &apos;s discussed in the english press , your lordship .
yes , and we would ask for a superinjunction
to prevent the mention of the superinjunction .
only in england .
look , i &apos;m sorry , but that is not necessary .
we need to get that book in .
the climb to trango towers .
it shows a pattern of abuse .
where are you going ?
i have an idea .
no , there &apos;s nothing there . i ... what am i looking for ?
i don &apos;t understand what the purpose of this whole page is .
eli , you still have your geek squad together , right ?
well , hello , alicia . how are you ?
you still have your internet trolls who tweet anonymously ?
yeah . why ? what do you need ?
i need some tweeting .
the tweeting fairies did their work during the night .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
100,000 tweet followers , your lordship .
the superinjunction and mr. cardiff &apos;s actions
are now a matter of discussion in the english press .
this is an obscenity , your lordship .
in this morning &apos;s chronicle :
&quot; what did oliver cardiff do on the slopes of trango ii ? &quot;
your lordship , where is the respect for our laws
when any young thug with a computer and a twitter account
can circumvent a lawful injunction ...
i &apos;m sorry , mr. thrush ,
but i haven &apos;t finished .
yes .
please continue , mr. brannon .
the subject of mr. cardiff &apos;s actions
during his pakistani climbing expedition
are now a subject of concern
in the english press , your lordship .
therefore , i do not need
the manuscript of only in may
in order to ask these questions .
we still believe the stricture
of the superinjunction applies , your lordship .
i did nothing wrong .
you didn &apos;t take the rope and climbing gear
from the japanese team on trango tower-- trango ii ?
i did nothing wrong .
then why did the french team say they found you
with the japanese pitons ?
we do not use pitons .
we &apos;re clean climbers .
we use chockstones and quickdraws .
yes , which you took from a japanese climber .
he was dying .
the hypocrisy here is amazing .
you , danny ,
you were on k2 when a korean climber died .
i know for a personal fact
you passed him on the way to the summit .
that was different .
how was that different ?
because he wasn &apos;t your brother ?
he froze to death , and you left him .
i left him . every climber left him .
and why ?
because we would have died carrying him down .
it is the law of the death zone .
we all know we can &apos;t be carried out .
and so you did it on everest .
the events as described in danny &apos;s book are a lie .
even though you passed a dying robert lambros on everest ?
the book , as told , is a lie .
mr. cardliff , are you planning another climbing expedition ?
yes .
when ?
don &apos;t answer that .
patagonia , in one month .
your lordship , there is qualified privilege
as an exception to our libel laws .
and what is that , mr. brannon ?
when they are a warning .
mr. cardiff has demonstrated a predisposition
for bypassing stranded climbers at altitude .
now , if this book is a warning to climbers in the future ,
then it is no longer held to the same burden of proof
maintained by our libel laws .
i , therefore , ask that this suit be dismissed
because this book , your lordship , is a warning .
your lordship , that is a strange interpretation of the law .
no , mr. thrush . i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a strange interpretation of the law at all .
in fact , it seems right .
we would agree with mr. brannon
and therefore dismiss the suit in letter rogatory .
oh . uh , apologies , your lordship .
thank you . seriously .
it &apos;s been a pleasure .
so you decided against an audit .
smart .
have alicia and her husband separated ?
is it any of our business ?
if there is blowback on our firm ,
then yes , it is our business .
is there blowback on our firm ?
will .
this is my life .
it &apos;s yours , too .
have alicia and her husband separated ?
ask her .
we can &apos;t be the enemy of the state &apos;s attorney .
we &apos;re not .
he wanted to audit us .
because he wants to run a clean office .
this is crazy .
she &apos;s supposed to work for us .
if she &apos;s working against , we should let her go .
she &apos;s not .
but if she is ?
then ... we &apos;ll let her go .
if she works against us , we are letting her go .
i can hold you to that ?
