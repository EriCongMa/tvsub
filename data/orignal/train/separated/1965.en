I got to open him up now. If I don't, he's dead.
Again, I'm not gonna allow you to open up a man in my ward.
This is not an O.R. You are not an attending.
No. No, no, no.
Are -- Are you insane?
Dr. Siegel, this man is going to die.
Warren, what are you doing?
I got it. I got his aorta in my hand.
Yeah, I got a pulse.
Right now, you better be praying
that this man doesn't die on the table.
This was a judgment call.
I took a risk, it paid off, and this man is alive.
I feel like I'd get in trouble for something like that.
It must be nice being married to the chief.
I don't think that's what's going on here.
Really? Warren's married to the chief,
so he's scrubbed in down there on a surgery
while we're stuck watching up here.
You don't think the two are related?
I know they are.
It was a unique situation --
I got an earful on how unique it was.
I'm clear on the situation.
I was trying to save a life.
The man was dying.
And how is he now?
Alive. Stable. I got to him in time.
No, you got lucky.
If you'd been left - with a dead man on that table
after you did what you did...
I wouldn't be letting you off with just a 3-day suspension.
You're suspending me?
I used to spend hours
studying old footage of my mother's surgeries.
I dissected every move,
every cut, every decision.
I was piecing together a puzzle --
watching, studying, learning.
It's a luxury we don't have
when a patient is splayed open in front of us.
Where's the main lobby?
There.
We can't rewind.
And the garage?
Over there.
There's no replay.
But he won't get that far.
I got guys at all the doors, guys rolling back tape.
We'll find him.
Yeah, you don't know that.
Look, it's my job to overreact, and I'm not there yet.
I'm telling you, this is not a Code Pink situation.
We just have to cut
and hope to God we know what the hell we're doing.
You need to call a Code Pink now.
We're not there yet, Karev.
The kid's hiding. It happens all the time.
Dad's got anger issues.
Custody battle with a huge fight just this morning.
If he took the kid -- - Statistically speaking,
that's not what happened.
Not to mention, my patient's infection puts him
at risk for an airway obstruction
if we don't find him right away.
Attention, Gage Dean, please return to your room.
Attention, Gage Dean.
Are you kidding me with that? He's 6.
He's not listening to announcements,
but I bet you his dad is, which means you just
scared the guy into moving even faster.
I don't think you understand
how a Code Pink disrupts this facility.
All automatic doors lock.
Elevators stop functioning.
Good. It'll stop the dad.
No, it'll potentially put patients in danger.
There's a kid who's in danger, and the longer we stand here
debating this, he's getting further away.
Code Pink is a nuclear option.
Just let my guys - look around for a little bit.
What if it was Tuck?
Call it. - You sure you want - to pull the trigger on this?
Sounding the alarm? Initiating a lock-down?
Yes, now.
She's sure.
She's calling it.
Jackson, I had no idea, or I never would have --
I-I was-- I wasn't trying to --
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to be, like,
a hundred feet from you or something.
If I had known that you weren't trying t--
I thought you were gonna take my baby, and so --
Did you set that off for me, too?
Oh, no.
Quick, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Why are we suddenly running a relay race?
Code Pink. Hospital's on lock-down.
Those doors just bolted shut behind us.
If we're gonna be stuck somewhere,
we need to have access to an O.R.
What is that, an alarm?
Code Pink -- missing kid.
It's almost...relaxing.
They don't want to freak people out.
It seems like they would want that.
Esophageal atresia, pulmonary sequestration,
spina bifida boy, spina bifida girl,
and teratoma cutie, so great. Everyone's here.
It says here the code's for a 6-year-old kid,
not an infant.
I don't care.
If someone's stealing babies,
you count all the babies.
Brown hair, green shirt.
Name -- Gage Dean.
Well, it's not like we can do anything from in here.
Gage?
Gage Dean, are you in here?
There. We did something.
Wire cutter.
I just need a description of your husband, ma'am.
Ex-husband.
I know the guy. I'm just gonna start looking --
The only way to get through the doors right now
is with one of these badges.
My men will fan out from peds.
They'll take it room by room.
We've got it handled -- Dr. Karev.
Out of my way, Cross.
No one came through here with a kid, right?
6 years old, green shirt?
Uh, I don't think so, but we're kind of slammed.
I've got these other kids from the accident.
I don't -- I don't know. I --
Bailey should have called this thing earlier.
He's probably just hiding somewhere.
That's what kids do, right?
Yeah, right.
We've walked the western perimeter.
Tell Stokes to report in with --
Hold it.
What?
Karev found him.
Kill the code. Start running the reports.
He's okay.
Oh, thank goodness they found him.
All right. How is he?
Well, he's a little shaken up
but no worse for the wear, right, Gage?
We're all making overtime today.
All righty.
He was hiding. Like I said.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
What?
What happened?
Please. You have to help.
I have to go. I have to go now.
This baby's lost almost all its volume.
I still can't get a pulse.
I have to get to the NICU.
I was paged. I --
Oh, my God. What -- What is going on?
What happened? What did you do?
Chief, I-I don't think she's gonna make it.
You do not stop what you're doing.
Get us some free hands.
She needs central access and multiple units of blood.
Tube's in. Call upstairs and tell them
Robbins is gonna need a clear O.R. Now!
All right.
You're getting tired. Let's switch.
Okay.
Gloves.
Who butchered this woman?
I need cricoid pressure!
I know this patient.
This is Gretchen McKay.
What's your name, honey?
My kids, please.
Are they okay?
There's three of them -- one girl and two boys.
35-year-old female, restrained driver,
five-car pile up.
34 weeks pregnant. Pulse is 120.
Complaining of abdominal pain.
My kids, and -- Oh, God. Omar Singh, my husband?
Okay, we'll take care of them and you.
I promise. What's your name?
Gretchen McKay.
36-year-old male, Omar Singh,
unrestrained passenger, hemodynamically unstable,
GCS at 11, obvious abdominal and chest contusions.
Sir, can you follow my light?
I barely have a pulse.
You said he was unrestrained?
Yeah, family of five in the car.
Three kids in the back seat.
Dad got T-boned on the side and took the brunt of it.
We need to get him inside right now.
Okay, Gretchen, I see you're holding your belly
pretty tight there. You hurting?
Yes.
Don't be scared.
We got you now, okay?
Yeah.
Come on. Let's go.
All right, you guys go.
I'm gonna wait for the kids. Karev!
I need you!
Chief, I've got a situation upstairs.
I've got a situation right here.
No, it's a possible Code Pink.
You sure?
Hey, Grey!
Got a possible Code Pink. Can you?
I got it. Go.
Okay, clear a path, people!
Coming through. Watch out.
Dr. Warren thought it was a delayed abruption
from the car accident.
Is Robbins is in the O.R.? Is she ready?
She needs to be scrubbed when we get there.
I know. I paged her.
She hasn't stopped bleeding.
I can't tell if it's uterine atony or --
Keep shoving in more packing, DeLuca.
I am. It's just -- It's coming out faster than it's going in.
How long's she been hypotensive?
Uh, at first she was fine, then she just --
How long?
Maybe five or six minutes before you arrived.
I'm not sure.
You need to get sure, DeLuca.
I'm gonna ask you again.
How long since her pressure bottomed out?
I'm sorry.
Sweetie, never do that again.
I was scared about the pear-eh-toe--
The peritonsillarabscess?
Look, don't be.
You've got this, buddy.
Once I get in there and fix your throat,
you're gonna feel so much better.
You're gonna be eating ice cream
and sliding down the rails of those stairs.
And riding the elevator?
Sure, whatever you want.
Just no more running away, okay?
It scares your mom, and I need to know where you are...
at all times.
I'm sorry. I need to go check on something.
Hey, do you know what happened?
I just heard that Gretchen McKay needs a crash-c.
You should tell the NICU that the baby's coming.
Arizona.
If she's lost blood,
then the baby's lost even more.
Has she even been cross-matched?
The crash-c already happened.
What?!
He's not oxygenating.
Page cardio and neuro.
Okay.
How old is this baby?
How far along was she?
Uh, 32 w-- No, 34 weeks, I think.
You think? Was she pre-eclamptic?
Diabetic?
Was there evidence of an abruption or a previo--
No, no, I mean, yeah.
It was a delayed abruption, or seemed to be.
She was hypotensive --
History of RH incompatibility? Talk to me, Warren.
I need to know what I'm dealing with here.
All right, I need some retractors here, Kocher clamps.
I can't see a damn thing.
Now!
Keep the laps coming.
Come on, I need more laps now.
Is she -- Is she gonna make it?
Be quiet. Suction.
I'm trying to get you visibility.
You got this?
Okay. Retract there.
On it.
Robbins, do you have this?
No, Bailey! No. I do not have this.
Now, stop talking to me so I can concentrate on getting it.
Who did this?
Okay. -
Is my baby gonna die?
Crap. He's bradying down.
The mom abrupted.
She needed an emergent C-section.
In the middle of the hallway? What the hell happened?
You have to understand, I-I would have lost them both.
Well, now we might anyway.
Send for an ABG now.
Okay, what else can I do?
Nothing. Just -- Just stand there.
No, I-I want to help.
Dr. Warren, I need to speak with you, privately.
W-When the baby's stable, I'll find you.
I-I need to stay. I need to assist.
W-We need to increase the frequency to 600 BPMs
and set the I.T. to 33% --
Dr. Warren, I'm not asking. Come with me...
right now.
Look, she was hypotensive.
She was bottoming out.
She -- - Stop talking.
Do not tell me a single thing.
Nothing.
I am the Chief of Surgery.
Every single thing you tell me I have to use.
So do not speak, got it?
Yeah.
Just stay right here in this office.
Don't come out. Don't talk to anyone.
Just wait for me to come back.
One thing.
Benjamin!
How is Gretchen?
Not one word.
Edwards, I could use some traction here.
Nice work, Grey.
Balloon catheter -- good idea.
We almost did a thoracotomy in the E.R.
Yeah, this bought us some time.
No, I mean,
we almost got to do thoracotomy in the E.R.,
which, you know, would have been amazing.
They must have found the kid, right?
You think he was hiding somewhere?
'Cause, I mean, how many times do you get to operate
outside the operating room?
Okay, for the record,
it sounds fun until you do it.
Grey.
Gretchen McKay.
How's she doing?
Uh, well, she just had an emergency C-section
performed by a resident.
What? She was fine when I left her.
Okay, well, that's what I'm asking.
Your name is listed as the attending,
so why did you leave her?
Uh, well, I just did the initial trauma eval,
and then I got pulled into her husband's room.
It was Robbins' case.
But I handed her off to you,
and you left her with Robbins?
No, I left her with Warren.
Did Warren do the C-section, or --
Just tell me what happened.
Gretchen McKay, 34 weeks pregnant.
No sign of abdominal trauma.
She does need an O.B. Consult. Where's Robbins?
On her way. How can I --
You can help DeLuca get her off this board.
Omar wasn't wearing his seat belt.
Spencer dropped a book. Omar reached back to get it.
Okay, he's right next door being checked out.
The car in front just stopped.
I hit the brakes.
Her BP's dropping.
Okay, Warren, what do we do?
DeLuca, move.
Third trimester can't always tolerate supine position.
Puts pressure on her IVC,
so we roll her to her left and...
Okay.
There you go. BP's back up.
Good job.
All right. Gretchen, are you comfortable?
My kids, uh... How are my kids?
I'll have someone find out, okay?
They're, uh -- They're fine. They're fine.
Jasmine has a bit of a stiff neck,
and Trevor's just a little nervous,
but Spencer has two loose front teeth
that he can't stop wiggling, but...
Those were loose before --
Before today, yeah, that's what he said.
Don't worry. We got them.
Thank you.
Grey! We need an extra set of hands over here!
Okay, I'll be right there!
That's my husband. That's my husband next door.
Okay, so I will go check on him for you.
Robbins will be by to scan her
and admit her for observation.
Are you okay here?
Yes. Go.
Okay.
Did you ask him?
Did you ask him if he was good, or did he tell you he was good?
Bailey, he was fine.
But you didn't even wait for Robbins.
How do you even know she got there?
Dr. Bailey, I saw Robbins.
What do we got?
Okay. Abdomen is tense and distended.
His belly's full of blood.
Pressure's 60 over 40.
Edwards, let's prep for a thoracotomy.
Oh, my G-- Uh, o-okay. Okay.
Edwards, what if we did a balloon catheter?
Robbins was in there. I saw her.
You saw her?
I did.
I mean, so how is she? Is the baby okay?
Bailey?
I heard there was blood on the walls...
and the ceiling.
Well, you know how amputations bleed.
You hit the femoral at just the right angle,
and it's amputations?
I heard he cut into some lady in a hallway.
No, I heard he cut the leg off of some lady in an elevator.
Below-knee. Very clean cut.
That doesn't even make sense.
What the hell are you two doing?
This isn't a movie.
Dr. Warren is not here for your entertainment.
What is this?
Concessions?
I, um -- I apologize. - Sorry, Dr. Torres.
Why are you still here?
You heard her. Scram.
What's that?
Oh. It's -- It's nothing.
I was holding on to it for Gretchen.
Her kid lost a tooth.
Okay. I need to know everything.
Yes, Chief.
I need to know what you two were doing.
I need to know exactly how and exactly why this happened.
Yes, Chief.
Look, her scans all look clear.
I know. We thought so, too.
We're done? Already?
Yep. You did great.
Scans look clear, Gretchen.
Good, then can we get my kids?
I'm sure the boys are destroying the emergency room by now.
One, two... Three.
Yeah, well, uh, let's get you up in O.B.,
and then we'll bring them up to you, all right?
Let's roll her.
You cold?
Maybe a little.
Okay, I'll get you another blanket, all right?
Can you find out about my husband?
Yeah, absolutely.
You okay? You comfortable?
This is -- My stomach hurts one way, my back hurts another.
You know, let's, uh -- let-- let's stop for a sec.
I'm gonna prop you up a little more, all right?
DeLuca, grab a pillow.
Yeah.
There you go.
Is that better?
Yeah, it's...
No. My stomach hurts.
Oh, it's just...
I don't feel so good.
Her pulse was a little high. She was clammy and shivering.
So Dr. Warren made a call.
You know what? We're gonna get you up to O.B.
and call Dr. Robbins, okay?
Okay
This way.
She's hypotensive.
Gr-Gretchen, you're doing great.
You're doing great. We have to get her up to --
All right. I got her.
Hang in there. Almost there.
I've lost the heartbeat.
What?
DeLuca!
Well, it, uh -- it might just be that the transducer slipped.
Oh, it hurts!
Yeah, I know. I know. We are so close.
Go. Get Robbins or anybody from O.B.
I'll take her up.
By yourself?
Go!
Okay.
Okay, Gretchen, as soon as the elevator gets here,
we're gonna take you up and take care of you, all right?
Oh, no.
Go! Go faster! Right Now! Go!
What the hell?
Th-They're locked.
Go, go, go, go, go!
They're all locked!
We were trapped in there.
Okay, we waited for someone to come, but...
And she was...
She was crashing.
We were gonna lose them both.
All right? There wasn't a choice.
And you're certain of that?
Yeah.
That's what Dr. Warren said.
They put the McKay baby on an oscillator.
It was hard to watch.
So little, doesn't have a name yet.
Warren didn't come out yet?
No. No one's gone in, either.
At least, not since we've been here.
I just don't know why he did it.
Why didn't he wait?
Well, I guess he thought he didn't have a choice.
They didn't know how long they'd be stuck there.
Damn it.
NICU.
Thanks for the chip.
Still, though. In a hallway?
Look, I get it.
We almost opened up the husband in trauma,
and it was all I wanted to do.
Surgery is a drug.
And operating outside the O.R.?
That is mainlining.
But he's a level head.
He's Gramps.
We are talking about the same person who used a clipboard
to slice open a patient in the psych ward.
Gramps goes rogue.
What do you think will happen to him?
I don't know.
If it was us?
Yeah. He's married to the Chief.
Maybe he's invincible.
Yeah.
Sir.
Oh.
What?
Doctors.
Diffuse loss of muscle tone.
I can't get him to oxygenate.
He needs to go on ECMO.
You think this little guy can handle that?
No.
Neither do I, but it's the only chance he has.
Sats are in the 80s.
I'm with you. Do it.
We need parental consent. Where are the parents?
Mom's in O.R. 1, dad's in O.R. 2.
Just go ahead and do it.
The uterine arteries are clamped,
but there's still blood everywhere.
She's not clotting. She's in D.I.C.
Order eight more units of blood and FFP.
Well, how's she doing?
Oh, good. Bailey, where's Warren?
I want to talk to him. What the hell happened?
Well, that's what I want to know.
Grey handed this patient off to you in the E.R.
Yeah. Suction.
And then DeLuca said they got stuck,
and then they had to --
Well, where were you when all this happened?
Hang another two units of blood on the Level 1.
The suction's not working. Fix it.
Robbins.
Um, I had -- I had Warren take her to CT.
Well, why didn't you take her?
W-What were you doing?
I-I don't -- I don't even know, Bailey. She was stable.
A resident can take a stable patient to CT.
Well, not when her fetus is in distress.
You think a resident should --
Bailey, they were both stable
when I left them with Warren!
Gretchen, good news.
Your baby is great. The heartbeat is strong.
There's no signs of any problems.
Hang in there, Cosmo.
Cosmo?
Yeah, that won't be his real name,
but it's what we're calling him till he gets here.
Omar had this really boring partner dinner
that I agreed to go to because --
hello -- night out like a grown-up,
and three cosmopolitans later...
baby on board.
Yikes.
Gretchen, your husband's on his way up to surgery right now,
but, uh, I have a visitor for you.
Come here, peanut.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Are you?
Spencer's tooth came out -- one of them.
He wants you to see it.
Did he pull it out, or did you?
I helped.
All right, we'll get you to CT first and then up to O.B.
Uh, the kids can meet you there.
Oh, DeLuca, do you mind finding something to put that in?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Okay, just a few more minutes.
Hang in there.
And, Jasmine, you're in charge.
Okay, just keep your hands out of your brother's mouth.
Okay.
So take her up to CT and then let me know
when the scans are up.
Okay.
She was fine when I left her.
Oh-chromic.
Besides, it's Warren.
Clamp.
What do you mean, "It's Warren?"
I mean if there was any resident I'd want
to do an emergency C-section, it would be Warren.
He's good.
He has done them before.
If he said he had to, I believe him.
He had to. He saved her life.
All right, be quiet!
Basin.
Suction.
Here.
Robbins.
Okay, DeLuca, start CPR.
You can stop now.
Stop, DeLuca.
Come on.
Come on.
I said stop.
Time of death -- 17:02.
The dad made it.
The mom didn't.
I hate it when it's babies.
Me too.
Um, Dr. Webber, I wanted to talk to you about Benjamin Warren.
Yeah, I thought you might.
Yeah, well, as head of the residency program,
I thought disciplinary action would be more appropriate
coming from you.
Thank you.
I see.
Yeah, I mean, nothing too harsh, of course,
but, uh, substantial enough.
Whatever you think.
Whatever I think.
Yes, sir.
No.
Excuse me?
I can't do that.
I can't take this out of your hands.
Oh, sir -- - A surgical resident could be responsible
for the death of two patients today.
I'm not your chief anymore. This is above my jurisdiction.
Oh, come on. - Especially - if we're dealing with
a resident who's out of control.
Don't -- Ben isn't a danger.
How do you know that?
Are you sure?
Was this a mistake, or was it hubris?
Did he do his job, or did he overstep?
Bailey, I know it's hard being his wife and his boss,
but you're the chief now.
This is your call.
It's your job.
Do your job.
外科主任
Hey, just wanted to, uh, see how you're holding up.
I'm not.
Look, she was dying,
and I'm telling you, I did the right thing.
Mnh-mnh. No, no, no, no.
You probably should not be telling me any of this, right?
Right. Of course.
Okay, um...
How are you doing?
All right. 10 minutes.
What?
You got 10 minutes.
Anything you tell me in those 10 minutes you never told me.
You got 10 minutes, and I'm out.
I was never here.
Go.
Look, I-I didn't want to do it.
I was out of options. She was crashing.
She got hypotensive.
It was the only way I could help her.
We lost the baby's heartbeat.
It hurts.
Yeah, I know, I know. We are so close.
Go, get Robbins or anybody from O.B.
I'll take her up.
By yourself?
Go!
Okay.
Okay, Gretchen.
As soon as the elevator gets here,
we are gonna take you up and take care of you, all right?
S-she was crashing.
Oh, no. No, no, no!
Go! Go faster! Now! Go!
What's happening?
Th-they're locked.
Go, go, go, go, go!
No, no, no, no, no.
They're all locked.
Start paging people right now.
Robbins, Karev, Hunt -- anybody.
Just tell them we're trapped down here.
It's just gonna be just a minute longer, okay?
Now, hang on. I am taking care of you.
D-Dr. Warren...
Yeah?
Dr. Warren.
I'm right here, Gretchen, all right?
I'm not going anywhere, I promise.
We're gonna have to wait it out a little longer.
I know, but...
is my baby gonna die?
I told her no.
No fevers.
Bandages look good.
You guys are superstars.
Uh, hey, guys, say hi to Dr. Bailey.
I just, uh, wanted to see if you settled in.
You guys are staying here tonight,
like a little slumber party.
Uh, in the morning, you can pick out
your own breakfast in the cafeteria.
Where are Mom and Dad?
Th-they're upstairs.
Dr. Bailey, can I talk to you?
Sure.
I'm in charge now.
You can tell me the truth.
Jasmine...
well, your dad had a long surgery,
so he's gonna be asleep for a while
so he can heal.
What about my mom?
Did she die?
I'm so sorry.
I thought so.
Trevor lost his tooth.
Yeah, I-I heard.
Um, I have it here.
Do you have any money?
The tooth fairy's supposed to come.
Just -- here.
Thanks.
Dr. Fields, medical records.
Dr. Fields, medical records.
I have the damage report for insurance.
There was no damage.
Which is what the report says.
Need your signature.
The PD's gonna want to know who ordered the false alarm.
Check to make sure your name is spelled correctly.
There's X's next to every place we need a signature.
Chief?
Run that back.
Miranda.
Come here.
Okay.
So, I've spent the day, uh, trying to uncover
why you did what you did.
I wanted to prove that you were put in a position that --
No, I wanted to know - that you made the right call.
Right. There was no other call to make.
I believed that.
I wanted to believe that.
The patient was dying.
I made the decision to save her life.
You made a decision - that you didn't have to make.
Yes, I did.
Y-You need to save a life, you do it.
No -- - You weren't there.
No. I wasn't.
Okay, so you cannot understand what I was dealing with.
Okay, then tell me.
Tell me what happened at the elevator.
It's time for you to talk to me now.
All right. All right, the, uh --
the patient was in distress, but she was lucid.
D-Dr. Warren.
Dr. Warren.
I'm right here, Gretchen, all right?
I'm not going anywhere, I promise....
We're gonna have to wait it out a little longer.
I know, but...
is my baby gonna die?
No.
No, we're j-- we're just a little stuck, that's all.
Really don't feel good.
Yeah, I know. I know.
Save the baby over me, okay? Please.
Gr-Gretchen, don't say that. Don't say it.
You just hold on a little longer, okay?
Please, I know - you're doing your best, but...
just -- just in case.
Gretchen, Gretchen, okay, you just
keep on breathing for me, okay?
Just -- Gretchen, just rest and breathe.
Gretchen. Gretchen.
Gretchen.
DeLuca.
I need a crash cart or a cut-down tray -- anything.
We got to wait for someone.
She's bottoming out right now, DeLuca.
Find something! Go!
DeLuca!
I got it. I got it.
What, you're gonna -- you're gonna cut her open?
Here?
Look, there isn't a choice.
Her heart is about to stop.
The minute it does, we lose her and the baby.
Okay.
Now, open that cut-down tray.
Okay.
I paged.
Someone is coming, okay?
They can't get to us. They can't get to us.
We are in a lock-down.
And even if they come, there's no more time.
The doors were locked. The elevator was closed.
There was nothing else to do.
You didn't know when they were gonna open.
Yeah. It could've been seconds, or it could've been hours.
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice.
Hindsight is always 20/20.
What?
I had to do it, to save her.
T-There was no other option.
Y-- You understand that.
Right?
It's easy to figure out what you should've done
when you replay it.
I found something.
You see your mistakes, you know how you'd correct them.
So the doors were locked. The elevator wouldn't open.
Gretchen was unconscious,
and DeLuca found a crash cart, right?
But that's the kicker, isn't it?
You were trapped.
We were trapped.
You got ready to open her up.
You lifted the scalpel.
You had a choice.
No, n-no.
No, no. That's not -- That's not what happened.
I didn't know - that the doors had opened. I --
Well, I-I'm looking at it, and so are you.
N-No, no. I don't care! Look. I didn't know!
No, you saw what you wanted to see.
You made a choice that
D-Do you really
you wanted to make.
believe that?!
What else am I supposed to believe?
Oh, son of a -- I am your damned husband!
