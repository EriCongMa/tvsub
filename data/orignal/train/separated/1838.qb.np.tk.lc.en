indeed .
i &apos;m not crazy .
i &apos;m not crazy . i &apos;m not crazy .
it &apos;s okay , hayley . honey ...
i &apos;m not crazy .
the doctors are gonna help you .
you paged surgery ?
hayley may , 16 , diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic .
tried to claw her eyes out .
i need you to clear her
before i can take her to psych .
she tried to claw her eyes out ?
we try to keep her safe .
she &apos;s on every med in the book .
but she doesn &apos;t eat , she doesn &apos;t sleep .
the slightest thing sets her off , talking even ,
so we &apos;re having her committed . we explained to her
that they were coming to get her to try and help .
we turned our back for a minute , just for one minute-
oh , my god .
hayley-
that &apos;s lorazepam in there .
i &apos;ll do it . i swear to god , i &apos;ll do it .
no , baby , please don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t believe me . nobody does .
so now , i swear to god ,
i &apos;ll stab myself .
hayley , i &apos;m dr. karev .
alex .
i need you to put that down .
it &apos;ll kill me , right ?
if i stuck this in my heart ,
it would kill me , right ?
you don &apos;t want to do that , hayley .
&apos;cause there &apos;s drugs in here , i would die , right ?
trust me .
i can help you .
i &apos;m not crazy .
i know . i- i ... i believe you .
everyone outside thinks you &apos;re crazy ,
but something &apos;s going on inside ,
and none of us understand .
so we need to figure out what that is ,
and the only way we can do that is if you put that down
and let me run some tests . okay ?
you promise ?
yes .
just put it down .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
good . that &apos;s good .
i &apos;m not crazy . i &apos;m not crazy .
i &apos;m not crazy .
page shepherd .
i &apos;d like to run some tests on hayley .
more tests ?
look , we- we &apos;ve been to doctors , okay ?
hayley is schizophrenic .
she was diagnosed months ago .
ken &apos;s father was schizophrenic .
he killed himself when ken was 8 .
look , dr. shepherd ,
it &apos;s just a few more tests , and @-@ and she wants them .
mr. and mrs. may , believe me ,
i understand your frustration .
but i @-@ it &apos;s possible something was missed .
honey , please .
fine .
okay
okay . okay .
thank you . i want to run an e.e.g. , a cat @-@ scan ...
oh , there you go .
good morning , amber and trish .
um , trish and amber met in the burn unit .
best friends ever since .
dr. grey .
amber collier , 28,
presents status post @-@ m.v.c.
amber was in a car when it flipped
and she was pinned under it while it burned .
driving while texting . we strongly recommend it .
dr. avery ,
will you please explain
how we &apos;re gonna use a tissue expander ?
we stretch healthy tissue injecting saline into a balloon
placed under the skull .
and today we &apos;ll remove that burned area
and cover it with new tissue .
you promise that afterwards ,
it won &apos;t look like a comb @-@ over , right ?
i will do my best .
dr. sloan , dr. bailey .
amber , how long havey best . your fingers looked like this ?
i don &apos;t know .
they always look pretty bad .
you can still do my surgery , right ?
we &apos;ll know more after we get me films on the fingers .
y- you &apos;re bummed out about getting a couple of x @-@ rays ?
you got a twin sister growing out of your head .
that &apos;s what you should be bummed about .
she was my wife &apos;s roommate ...
her @-@ her best friend .
and you haven &apos;t seen one another since then ?
she was supposed to be in our wedding-
my wife &apos;s maid of honor .
but she disappeared .
i- i figured that i would write her eventually and try to explain
but how do you say ,
&quot; i couldn &apos;t stand up in your wedding
because i fell in love with your fiancee &quot; ?
there was a party .
i- i @-@ i remember , the sky was so clear that night ,
and i went outside to look at the stars ,
and there was betty .
it just ...
happened .
i felt terrible .
it was wonderful .
he was my first .
she was my first .
yeah , irene and i were waiting for our wedding nights .
for the first time in my life , i felt complete .
being with henry , i felt complete .
i wanted to tell irene .
i wanted to call off the engagement .
would &apos;ve been a terrible scandal .
and @-@ and it would &apos;ve ruined my friendship with irene .
a- but of course ,
the friendship was ruined anyway .
she just left .
she went to grad school across the country and ...
and i ...
i married irene .
well , i @-@ i loved irene .
but she wasn &apos;t ...
she wasn &apos;t betty .
i told myself there &apos;d be plenty of henrys in my life .
and were there ?
my husband was a good man-
kind , funny , smart-
but he was no henry .
there was never ... another henry .
dr. torres ...
i have an idea .
nearly 50 years later , and still all of those feelings .
that &apos;s saying something , isn &apos;t it ?
is that a good idea ? he just had a heart ablation .
i mean , he should be resting .
a happy patient is a healthy patient , yang .
this scan shows a diaphragmatic rupture from the fall .
we have to get him in an o.r. soon .
he can wait an hour .
let &apos;s let &apos; em catch up .
you &apos;re okay with this ?
i &apos;m with webber . i can &apos;t help it .
i &apos;m a romantic .
you think she &apos;s schizophrenic ?
i think she threatened to stab a syringe into her own heart ,
so i &apos;m leaning toward crazy , yeah .
scans are up .
there &apos;s nothing in the frontal lobe .
or the temporal parietal region .
occipital lobe &apos;s clean , too .
crap .
told you . crazy .
we tried , karev .
all the tests are negative . okay ?
let &apos;s go inform the parents and turf her up to psych .
look , this isn &apos;t right .
i know crazy .
i @-@ i grew up with crazy . i dated crazy
and i don &apos;t think this girl is crazy .
just give me some time .
do you have a specific diagnosis in mind ?
no , but-
she &apos;s suicidal , alex .
what you did in the e.r. , you saved her life .
but those parents have been through hell .
look , you say it &apos;s our job to advocate for the patient-
the patient , not the parents .
so whatever hell they &apos;ve gone through ,
hers is worse .
i do say that , advocate for the patient .
you &apos;ve got until my board meeting is over .
four hours . go dig .
alex ...
are we a couple ?
what ?
i need to know what we are , because people ask ,
and i don &apos;t know what to say . i- i &apos;m over mark .
and i @-@ i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re over izzie ,
but i am over mark sloan for real .
and i @-@ i know @-@ i know that we said that , you know ,
this wasn &apos;t gonna be a thing , but i like you .
look , the point is ,
i want to know what we are ,
what this is .
we &apos;re a thing .
yeah , we &apos;re together . we &apos;re ...
we &apos;re a thing .
whatever .
dr. altman ,
can i do the mesh repair of the diaphragm ?
no , i can sew it up with a continuous suture .
and if you use stay sutures on either side of the laceration ,
it can be tented down
to aid closure .
i know . they &apos;ll help with closure .
that &apos;s quite a shorthand you two have .
we worked together a long time .
yeah , i get it .
i had that once with ellis grey and i ,
from the first day we worked together .
i miss it .
she &apos;s got hyperacusis , vertigo ,
tinnitus , nystagmus . this blows .
so you and lexie ?
what ?
i mean , i &apos;m just saying , you and lexie ,
it &apos;s not just a sex thing anymore .
it &apos;s a
i &apos;m acting like a duck .
what ?
i figure , if you walk like a duck
and you quack like a duck ,
eventually you start to feel like a duck .
lexie is nice and normal and healthy .
i &apos;m acting like a guy who can stick with nice
and normal and healthy .
you &apos;re becoming a duck .
i am becoming a duck .
cristina , seriously ?
what &apos;s up with that ?
she &apos;s mad at me
because i planted seeds of doubt about her moving in with owen .
don &apos;t talk to him about me .
well , why don &apos;t you come over here
so i can talk to you about you ?
i &apos;ll talk to you when you actually talk .
i mean , are you ready to talk ?
oh ! i need the lexopedia to diagnose my patient .
she &apos;s not a book you can flip through .
i kinda am . go .
a 16 year old with hyperacusis ,
vertigo , tinnitus , nystagmus ...
cholesteatoma ...
or temporal lobe tumor .
for god sakes , will you just come over here ?
no .
scans were clean .
uh , it &apos;s worse with sounds . we have to whisper .
page 162 in a june ... 2004 issue of a journal
with a mint green cover .
it &apos;s , uh , sound- or pressure @-@ induced vertigo .
it &apos;s called , um ... i can &apos;t ...
crap . i can &apos;t see it . um , i can &apos;t-
it &apos;s like the computer froze .
june &apos; 04 , mint green cover , it &apos;s in the research library .
got it . thanks .
so mark slept with reed . gross , right ?
but you &apos;re with alex .
i know . no , i &apos;m just saying , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s gross .
i mean , that @-@ that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s all . i &apos;m just ... it &apos;s gross .
do you think i &apos;m thatcher ?
is that what you were trying to tell me this morning ,
that i @-@ i &apos;m thatcher ?
what ?
owen is ellis , and , uh , teddy &apos;s dr. webber ,
and somehow i &apos;m thatcher in the situation ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know .
forget it .
i don &apos;t understand . you didn &apos;t find anything .
i just feel like we &apos;re torturing her for no reason .
okay , hayley , we &apos;re gonna start now .
and when i say now , i want you to ...
pinch your nose and blow .
make sure you keep your eyes open , okay ?
now .
what &apos;s happening to her eyes ? what &apos;s going on ?
no .
no . no . no !
no , no .
hayley , honey , it &apos;s mommy . it &apos;s mommy .
no .
i &apos;m right here .
what the hell did you do to her ?
i just diagnosed her .
so you don &apos;t have a middle name ?
like , for real ?
my parents couldn &apos;t agree ,
so they decided not to bother .
oh , we @-@ we &apos;re just gonna have to do something about that .
um ... how about cheeky ?
liz cheeky mckee ?
yeah . i like it . got spunk .
take care .
miranda , that was ...
miranda ...
you have to cut off three of my fingers ?
they &apos;re infected , amber .
it also means we have to postpone your hair restoration .
i &apos;m sorry .
amber , you survived a horrible car wreck .
you &apos;ll survive this , too .
i know , but-
hey , what do we always say ?
we &apos;re both alive . that &apos;s what matters .
everything else is just bumps and bruises .
you can cry , amber . it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s a lot to take in all at once .
no , she needs to stay positive .
that &apos;s how we get through . we stay positive .
she was excited , she was hopeful , she was eager ,
and that has been crushed .
she has the right to have some feelings .
she can be positive tomorrow .
you can be positive tomorrow .
thank you .
it &apos;s called superior canal dehiscence syndrome .
it &apos;s the result of a small hole that developed in her inner ear .
it &apos;s rare , and it &apos;s hard to diagnose .
the condition wasn &apos;t even written up until 1998 .
the noise sensitivity , the sandpaper , it &apos;s because
hayley could hear everything going on inside her body .
and every sound outside was magnified .
that &apos;s why she couldn &apos;t sleep or eat .
she &apos;s not schizophrenic .
was the sex with altman- was it lousy ?
did she disappoint you ?
what ? no .
no .
is one woman never enough for some men ?
i- i @-@ no , i @-@ i really want to know , because i-
me , i think i &apos;m a good judge of character .
i- i am ... a good judge of character ,
and i @-@ and i-
and i think altman is a good judge of character .
and then she trusted you .
she trusted you , and then you go ...
i- i just want to know .
teddy and i were never exclusive .
were you and your guy ... exclusive ?
we &apos;re @-@ we &apos;re not talking about me .
at the end of the trail ,
there &apos;s @-@ there &apos;s an overlook .
you @-@ you can see the entire bay from up there .
of course , the view would be even nicer
if i had someone to share it with .
come live with me .
henry .
it &apos;s a nice place- warm , quiet .
we @-@ we barely know each other .
we know each other .
we missed our chance once , betty .
i &apos;d hate to make the same miske again .
betty ... i need to @-@ i need to get you up to surgery .
think about it .
that &apos;s all i ask .
i got over you ...
henry .
i married mike , i had four kids ,
now grandkids that give me such joy .
i got over you .
i &apos;m sorry .
looks like that &apos;s just about it .
you want to have the anesthesiologist ...
start lightening her up ?
you could ask me directly .
dr. sloan ?
you want to start lightening her up ?
no .
wait .
i want to do the hair restoration .
at about the chance of infection ?
infection looked pretty isolated .
do you think we can do it ?
seems to me that we are all in need of a little magic today .
right , dr. bailey ?
let &apos;s do it .
do you think your mom ever got over the chief ?
you think she still loved him after all those years ?
my mom loved richard until the day she died .
what were you trying to tell me this morning
about teddy and owen ?
is there @-@ is there something i &apos;m not seeing ?
cristina-
meredith , please just- just tell me what you know .
just ... w @-@ why ?
you have to understand .
it &apos;s been just you and me for a long time .
and now it &apos;s me and derek , and it &apos;s you and me .
and i told you what i said this morning
because it &apos;s you and me ,
but i can &apos;t tell you any more because it &apos;s me and derek .
fine . you know what ? i get it .
but i need you to understand
that i need there to be a me and owen .
i hate your job .
i love you .
stop trying to make me happy .
do you think he loves her , owen and teddy ?
i mean , do you think that that &apos;s why ?
meredith-
i &apos;m saying , when he threw her under the bus ,
what read did you get ?
do you think he loves her ?
you can &apos;t tell cristina .
i know that . that &apos;s why i hate your job .
want a hug ?
yeah .
impressive technique .
who taught you that ?
mark .
he taught me one @-@ handed ties , mattress stitches ,
dual onlay bone grafts .
now he can teach his techniques to reed .
lexie ...
it &apos;s fine . i &apos;m fine . i don &apos;t care .
i &apos;m with alex .
i do not care about mark and or who he sleeps with .
that &apos;s the same thing i keep telling myself about arizona ,
that i don &apos;t care . and you know what ?
sometimes it works for the most part .
but then a patient gets asked to move across the country
for a man she barely knows , and all i can think is
how stupid they were to let each other go in the first place .
all i want is for her to change her mind and say yes .
i want to believe .
okay , time to close off the canal .
you &apos;re using fascia and bone wax ?
yep , and then we &apos;ll cover it
with the cortical bone graft we &apos;ve harvested
and seal it with the fibrin glue .
she &apos;ll be good as new .
you cover a hole with a bone graft ,
and this girl gets her whole life back .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice if everything in life were that simple ?
i hoped it wouldn &apos;t leave such a big scar .
well , it &apos;ll look better in a couple of weeks ,
once it has a chance to heal .
be doing shampoo commercials in no time .
and your hand is just bumps and bruises . right ?
i lost three fingers today , trish .
that &apos;s not bumps and bruises .
i know that .
but we &apos;re alive .
it &apos;s better than the alternative .
i call in sick to work sometimes
because i just can &apos;t bear to drive .
i sit in my car in my garage ...
and i &apos;m so angry about what happened to me ,
that i can &apos;t drive my car .
for hours , i just sit there .
does that ever happen to you ...
that you &apos;re so angry you can &apos;t breathe ?
because i do . but i can &apos;t tell you that
because i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m being ... weak or ungrateful .
please . you are my best friend .
horrible things have happened to us .
can we just be real with each other for once ?
i can &apos;t watch romantic comedies anymore
because ... i just want to yell at the woman ,
&quot; you can &apos;t find mr. right ? that &apos;s your biggest problem ? &quot;
&quot; well , try having most of your face burned off , &quot;
&quot; you stupid , bitch . &quot;
&quot; see what a freakin &apos; pretty woman you are then . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
thank you .
cristina loves you ,
and i want to , but i can &apos;t
because i want to punch you in the face right now .
i know you tried to have teddy fired .
and i believe it &apos;s because you love her .
and if you care about christina at all , you will tell her .
if you &apos;re actually the good guy that she thinks you are ,
you will tell her .
and if you don &apos;t , then i &apos;ll know
and you &apos;ll know that you are not that guy .
look , teddy ...
i wanted to say that ...
look , i should &apos;ve knocked . it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s that simple .
and it &apos;s that over .
talk to her .
i just did . she doesn &apos;t want to .
no , i &apos;m not talking about teddy . i &apos;m talking about lexie .
you still love lexie ,
and sleeping around isn &apos;t gonna fix that .
and the reasons that you broke up
little sloan and the baby- they &apos;re not reasons anymore .
she &apos;s with karev .
yeah , well , betty married mike ,
but she never got over henry .
what ?
look , you don &apos;t want 50 years to go by
and then realize that you let the love of your life get away .
so go . try .
you gonna try again with robbins ?
why not ?
because my reasons are still reasons .
look , i don &apos;t understand .
you told shepherd to hire dr. evans over teddy ?
when i asked you to go to bat for her ,

i shouldn &apos;t have to explain myself to ...
christina ...
i don &apos;t know what i feel for teddy .
i don &apos;t know
because she &apos;s all wrapped up with everything else
with men being blown apart in front of me , with beth .
so it &apos;s complicated and it is screwing with my head .
that &apos;s the truth . i don &apos;t know what i feel for her .
but i do know what i feel for you .
so , yes , i told shepherd to hire the other guy .
and i shouldn &apos;t have to explain myself ...

so i can get myself better .

i shouldn &apos;t have to explain myself to you
and i damn well do not have to explain myself to meredith grey .

i &apos;ve called a colleague at your hospital at home ,
and he &apos;ll see you once we clear you to travel .
thank you .

you can &apos;t do that again .
if i &apos;m gonna move halfway across the country
to shack up with you ...
you can &apos;t do that again .
really ?
you make me feel like the prettiest girl at the party .
when you look at me , i become a young girl again .
and i never stopped missing you , and i never stopped wondering .
i did the right thing once .
now i &apos;d like to do the wrong thing
and see how that goes .
how long do you need me to wait before i propose ?
christina ...

ask most people what they want out of life ,
and the answer &apos;s simple ...
to be happy .
maybe it &apos;s this expectation , though , the wanting to be happy ...
that just keeps us from ever getting there .
i need to talk to you .
hey , i get it .
you want to see other people .
so go . be free .
get cheeky with liz .
liz is the meanest nurse on the floor .
she makes everybody in my department &apos;s life hell .
but she likes me .
she doesn &apos;t schedule me for work on tuesday mornings
because she knows that &apos;s when i play golf .
she doesn &apos;t put me in the o.r. with hendricks because
she knows i can &apos;t stand the way he talks to himself when he operates .
and she does these favors for me because i flirt with her .
flirting makes my job easier .
and what you saw back there , that @-@ that middle name stuff ?
that &apos;s bad flirting , lazy flirting .
for you , who i actually like ...
i break out my good flirting , my a @-@ game ...
because i mean it .
are you hearing me , miranda ?
i ... i mean it .
i have a child ...
and a full @-@ time job .
and i &apos;m going through a sad ...
exhausting , stressful , time @-@ consuming divorce .
i don &apos;t have time for games .
i mean , you understand that , right ?
i do .
i do , and i &apos;m not- i &apos;m not playing games .

karev .

i &apos;m saying , you can have a husband .
maybe the more we try and will ourselves to states of bliss ,
the more confused we get ...
you ready ?
yeah .
to the point where we don &apos;t recognize ourselves .
arizona ...
instead , we just keep smiling ...
trying like hell
to be the happy people we wish we were .
until eventually it hits us , it &apos;s been there all along ...
