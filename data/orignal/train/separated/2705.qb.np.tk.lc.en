who &apos;s a big boy ?
lilac personal shopping .
hey , you .
my cousin came through on those day @-@ spa certificates .
excellent . how &apos;s outside daffy &apos;s , at 11 : 00 ?
perfect .
you want some lunch ? i was just gonna sit down to a tuna san .
onions , in the morning ?
actually , it &apos;s 2 : 00 .
i &apos;m going out by the pool .
what , mom ?
you were gonna get up at 8 : 30 to be at tcby yogurt ...
when the manager got there .
it &apos;s , like , five days till school starts . why get a job now ?
i don &apos;t know . a few textbooks you could buy .
pairs of socks . anything that we don &apos;t have to supply .
this thing about working between now and start of classes ...
is about you being pissed &apos; cause i didn &apos;t intern at the paper mill playhouse .
we bought you a car so you could drive back and forth to your internship .
you don &apos;t feel bad that you didn &apos;t live up to the deal ?
jesus , we &apos;ve been through this how many times ?
there was no stagecraft in what they had me doing at the playhouse .
xeroxing does not count towards a drama minor internship .
did you call the drama department , check that out ?
i didn &apos;t , so can we shitcan the courtroom theatrics ?
watch your mouth .
like i haven &apos;t been through enough this year .
12 credits , 2 semesters in a row , and i &apos;m not entitled to a summer ?
you hardly ...
hello ?
are you kidding ?
listen , can i call you back ?
you hardly broke a c , meadow , your entire second semester .
maybe you forgot my ex @-@ boyfriend died ?
your grades were going down while you were still going out with jackie .
great .
jesus , did you ever lose a friend at my age ?
did you ever have to grieve when you were 19 ?
honey , you should &apos;ve been working this summer ...
to feel good about yourself ... get your mind off jackie ,
instead of laying out by that pool .
i read , mom , out by that pool .
probably half the canon .
&quot; the canon . &quot; okay , what is that , now ?
&quot; now &quot; ?
the great books ? western literature ?
dead white males ?
who even in their reductionism ...
have quite interesting things to say about death and loss .
maybe more interesting than what you have to say .
is mary higgins clark a part of that group ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s what i saw you reading every time i passed by the pool .
hello ? you &apos;re not surprised , are you ?
come on , he &apos;s so totally duplicitous .
he had the nerve to come to the pub @-@ crawl ?
can i call you back ?
are we done talking ?
did you go on @-@ line and register for your classes ?
i will .
just go .
there &apos;s some guy in your driveway with a ponytail .
what is his story ?
hi , mrs. sop &apos; .
hello , misty .
fur &apos; , hi . he &apos;ll be down in a second . he &apos;s just changing .
he was working outside this morning .
do you want some coffee ?
sure .
i &apos;m gonna buy a house , you know ?
i didn &apos;t . where ?
nutley .
so you &apos;re gonna stay ?
you gonna become a citizen , too ?
you don &apos;t need that .
how &apos;s it going , ton &apos; ?
here at peaceful acres ? just swell .
i don &apos;t got time for coffee .
drop me off at the mechanic &apos;s , so i can pick up my car .
then i got an appointment , and i &apos;ll drive myself , all right ?
later .
say goodbye to mead &apos; for me .
why don &apos;t you say goodbye yourself ?
i &apos;ll tell you what a gold mine is , those harry potter books .
that &apos;s &apos; cause it gives the other kids , the 98 @-@ pound weaklings , some hope .
speaking of 98 pounds ...
i hear ginny sack &apos;s getting a 95 @-@ pound mole taken off her ass .
that &apos;s some guy &apos;s wife , come on !
all right , gentlemen , i got to go .
talk to patsy .
happy birthday .
all right .
see you , guys .
see you , ton &apos; .
happy birthday , al .
i understand we got some business to discuss .
the floor is yours .
go on , tell him .
i drove out to youngstown to see uncle paulie ...
and he was , i don &apos;t know ...
hoping you could settle this shit with ralph ... and the no @-@ show carpenter jobs .
ralph .
okay , for the record , i had my guy go over the books .
we can do maybe two carpenter jobs ,
one no @-@ show , one no @-@ work .
two jobs . on a $ 300 million project ?
come on .
what &apos;s the real number ?
what ? am i speaking in tongues , here ? two . maybe i can do three .
my uncle &apos;s looking for at least 10 .
i &apos;m talking , here .
the guy &apos;s in the can .
you think you want to keep him happy , maybe ?
all right . here it is .
and this comes from ...
for the duration ,
you will give paulie five carpenter jobs ...
two no @-@ shows and three no @-@ works .
one of the no @-@ shows , our friend in youngstown keeps ...
and one , he gives to chrissy here .
the others , the no @-@ work jobs , that &apos;s for paulie ...
how he wants to distribute them .
it is so decreed . now , if there isn &apos;t anything else ?
there is something else .
with paulie in the can , there &apos;s a new acting capo of his crew .
it &apos;s chrissy .
that &apos;s the way certain people want it ... and we trust there will be no ill will .
this is fucking great ! i mean , i know i &apos;m just the acting , but still ...
it &apos;s a big responsibility .
i got it covered .
first thing i &apos;m doing is getting wings in my hair .
you know , like paulie .
i &apos;ll talk to you later .
see these crystal paperweights ?
last year , i bought the christmas gifts ... for the entire jets front office .
over 600 of these , shaped like footballs .
you ever get tickets ?
lost the account .
to better times .
that &apos;s so adorable , with the animals shaped like letters .
i know . if i ever have a baby ...
yeah .
what ?
nothing .
christopher talks about having kids , once in a while .
i don &apos;t know .
where is our angry young man ?
out with his friends , i guess .
i used to date this one guy , vinnie .
he was more like a fuck buddy , but he lived on staten island .
i swear , we &apos;d be in the middle of doing it ,
and if his goddamn beeper went off ...
then he &apos;d just leave .
i think he was , like , connected , or something .
he used to carry a gun .
it was probably just to protect himself .
i mean christopher does , too , sometimes .
when you &apos;re in a cash business ...
stocks is a cash business ?
can i tell you something ?
sure .
i don &apos;t think i can have kids .
what ? why ?
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m telling you this . it &apos;s just that i feel really close to you .
a long time ago , before christopher even ... i had an abortion .
i didn &apos;t want to . i know it was wrong ...
but the guy was such an asshole , it was really the best thing .
anyway , there were complications .
my gynecologist says that there &apos;s a good chance ...
i won &apos;t be able to hold a pregnancy .
oh , god , i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m telling you this .
christopher don &apos;t even know . my own mother even .
sometimes it helps to talk .
they can do incredible things these days , ade .
when the time comes ...
i know a great ob @-@ gyn that my sister went to in the city .
really ?
you just show up without calling ? i thought you were going out .
i &apos;m a man of many mysteries .
danielle , this is christopher &apos;s friend , paulie germani .
hey , how you doing ?
you put this in the back of your freezer , it &apos;ll take out any odors .
go on , buy her a drink somewheres . i got to talk to my fiancee .
some manners ?
i &apos;ll call you tomorrow .
so what ? you from around here ?
something &apos;s wrong with that broad .
something &apos;s wrong with you .
oh , yeah ? here &apos;s what &apos;s wrong with me .
holy shit !
oh , my god .
these diamonds ...
harry winston , baby .
it &apos;s got more carats than bugs bunny .
i had a great conversation with silvio today .
what ? tell me .
let &apos;s just say that carmela ain &apos;t gonna be first lady forever .
political disagreement is often a catalyst ...
leading to violence in a world gone mad .
burning rage in korea spilled onto the street with deadly results .
check it out . guy in the red jacket ?
in 10 seconds , that cop &apos;s a fucking fireball .
i don &apos;t think i want to see this .
janice !
fuck , it &apos;s my brother .
i &apos;m coming .
what are you doing here ?
i was nearby , at bacala &apos;s .
figured i &apos;d come by , say hello .
good .
how &apos;s he doing ?
he &apos;s fat .
faces of death ? what ? was the sound of music already rented ?
it &apos;s research for our christian rock video ...
i &apos;m coordinating with the record release .
that tommy mottola , he &apos;s one slow motherfucker .
what &apos;s it been , about a year ?
actually , we are not going with sony .
we &apos;re considering a smaller , independent label .
naturally . got any coffee ?
i may only have soymilk .
what ?
what do you care ? it &apos;s none of your business , anyhow .
ralph cifaretto ?
it &apos;s always fucking something with you .
why don &apos;t you stay out of other people &apos;s living rooms ?
jesus christ .
you look good . better than last time .
ralph came through with those jobs .
what did tony say ?
it was tony made him do it .
i wished albert &quot; happy birthday &quot; for you .
who &apos;s been to see my ma ?
i don &apos;t think anybody , paulie .
chrissy says tony sent her some chocolates .
chrissy said t made a killing in real estate , down frelinghuysen .
that assemblyman guy hyped him to it .
ralph told this funny fucking joke , though ... at albert &apos;s party .
he goes :
&quot; ginny sack had a 95 @-@ pound mole ... &quot; surgically taken off her ass . &quot;
he said that ?
yeah .
and you think it &apos;s funny ?
it &apos;s in bad taste ?
the fuck ?
that &apos;s not what i want .
i want 50 t &apos;s , 50 reverse , got that ?
guys . pick up those ice @-@ cream wrappers .
if i were a carpenter and you were a douche bag
what are you doing ?
breaking my balls , what &apos;s it look like ?
i tell you , this no @-@ show shit is tough .
deciding what not to wear to work , what not to put in my lunchbox ...
you &apos;re breaking my heart .
you should try sitting here 10 : 30 to 3 : 00 .
you got carson avenue ?
you know that girl the other night ? danielle ?
she &apos;s a piece of ass , but fucking rude .
it &apos;s all here ?
you remember to put the spores in there ?
that &apos;s not funny .
what the fuck &apos;s all that ?
fiber @-@ optic cable .
high @-@ speed internet access .
lot of money in this shit .
the kid was supposed to get a job this summer , an internship .
then it wasn &apos;t right for what she was studying . okay . that &apos;s one down .
then she was gonna be a hostess at artie
bucco &apos;s restaurant . i got her that .
then she couldn &apos;t work tuesdays and thursdays ...
&apos;cause of her baby @-@ sitting commitment ,
and artie didn &apos;t try to understand ... so she left .
then the baby @-@ sitting family disappeared to nantucket .
then something else fell through , and then ...
so , she &apos;s regressing .
she keeps it up , she &apos;ll be back in the womb .
over the course of a child &apos;s life ...
there &apos;s a constant moving away and coming back .
security versus freedom .
but what i find interesting , and that &apos;s if i hear you right ...
is that at the age of 19 ... she actually wants to stay close to home .
see , that &apos;s what i was gonna say .
she did have someone close die .
jackie .
but she brings that up whenever you ask
her to clean up after herself , or whatever .
that she &apos;s traumatized .
he was shot to death .
it &apos;s tragic , that kid .
it was some kind of drug deal , you said .
exactly , all the earmarks .
it &apos;s gotta be tough .
then again , they &apos;d been broken up , and he wasn &apos;t very nice to her .
it may be a manipulation , in part .
she &apos;s got a hard @-@ on about columbia .
&quot; it &apos;s so competitive . &quot;
but it doesn &apos;t mean that her pain over jackie &apos;s death isn &apos;t real .
has she said to you or carmela she &apos;s depressed ?
come on with that shit . she &apos;s gonna be all right .
maybe she should be on medication .
and her anger is focused on carmela , not on you ?
i catch some shit .
but me and mead &apos; were always close .
even in that 15 @-@ year @-@ old period , you know ?
when she could hardly stomach carmela ?
you are the dad .
the template for all future lovers .
she loves me .
i know that .
since she was a tiny baby .
might be helpful if she saw someone .
dr. wendi kobler .
she &apos;s an adolescent psychologist and an educational consultant .
what do you mean ? talk about private family stuff ,
like i do here , with you ?
yes .
like you said , she &apos;s going back to school ...
she &apos;s gonna be with her college pals , back to the grindstone .
that &apos;s all good shit .
i thought you had final registration today .
technically , drop @-@ and @-@ add goes on for the next three weeks .
still , shouldn &apos;t you register for the classes you know you want ...
so you don &apos;t lose them ?
look ... i decided to take a year off .
you what ?
and do what , loaf around the house ?
actually , i &apos;m going to europe with misty .
what are you talking about ?
look , mom , i &apos;m just not ready .
if i go back now , i &apos;ll have to start meeting with advisors ...
who &apos;ll at least want me to temporarily declare a major ...
or independent course of study . i &apos;ll have that to deal with .
and obviously you don &apos;t want me around here .
that is not what i said at all .
you think i don &apos;t want you here ?
she knows what i fucking make . who am i ? bill gates ?
i already support the kids .
you &apos;re a bartender . you &apos;re supposed to be listening to my problems .
sorry i &apos;m late . what &apos;s up ?
you tell me.got a call from jack massarone .
massarone construction ? a very angry call .
the m80 in the porta @-@ pot . i told benny ...
don &apos;t fuck with me on this .
the fiber @-@ optic shit .
you knew it would be boosted ?
no . yeah . i mean , patsy mentioned something ...
jesus christ , if i wanted patsy in charge ...
use your fucking head , christopher .
i &apos;m sorry , t , i thought i was .
by drawing heat to a $ 250 million job ?
think . the big fucking picture .
aren &apos;t they insured ?
she &apos;s nice , janice , you know ? not my usual type , but ...
her hair , it &apos;s pretty . pre @-@ raphaelite , they call it . with the curls .
nothing but net , motherfucker .
she does have an earthy quality , you got to give her that .
it &apos;s those big tits .
no disrespect .
and , of course , there &apos;s the issue of her family .
making her happy wouldn &apos;t be the worst thing in the world for my career .
game .
where you going ?
come on . i &apos;m tired .
come on . one more .
come on ,
a little fucking defense .
hook shot .
thank god . where is the number of the therapist melfi gave you ?
why ? what happened ?
she &apos;s going to europe , your daughter .
she &apos;s dropping out of school , going all over the place on a eurail pass .
what is she , fucking kidding ?
apparently not .
her passport from our christmas in the bahamas is still valid .
where is she ?
i don &apos;t know . down the shore .
i suppose all these parties she goes to ...
they &apos;re all memorials for jackie junior , right ?
please , with the yelling .
you still on @-@ line ?
as a matter of fact , i am !
what the fuck &apos;s in europe ?
experience .
real life . art .
i knew all this constant harping on art was gonna cause trouble .
gonna work in publicity or something .
some friend of misty &apos;s is making a movie in denmark .
i think we should call that therapist .
she &apos;s going back to school . they got counselors there .
better ones , lvy league ones .
no fucking way she &apos;s going to europe .
fine .
maybe they don &apos;t have to talk .
maybe they &apos;re the kind of couple that doesn &apos;t have to talk constantly .
one beer left ?
danielle was over . we had pizza .
i figured out what &apos;s wrong with that broad , and it &apos;s some bad shit .
what &apos;s the matter , baby ?
tony again ?
i owe this guy a lot , but he &apos;s a fucking jerk sometimes .
like he never heard of a learning curve .
you know what ?
i &apos;m gonna get high .
i thought you were gonna stop using junk &apos; cause of your new job .
i am .
this is my goodbye party with heroin .
you want to do a hit ?
i don &apos;t know . i did some blow at the club .
it &apos;s funny with tony .
it &apos;s like danielle was saying , how we send food to the poorer countries .
no good deed goes unpunished .
what is it with you and this girl ?
what ? i can &apos;t have friends ?
you &apos;re amazing , you know that ?
with all your intelligence , you never see the big picture .
you met her where ?
at the mall . so ?
think , adriana .
girl like that . ass like that .
she don &apos;t have a boyfriend , she don &apos;t like paulie .
like he &apos;s jude law .
whatever .
are you that fucking blind ?
she &apos;s a dyke .
you think ?
use your head . it &apos;s a $ 250 million job .
my head ? it was your idea .
excuse me ?
when the kid there , vito , told you how expensive the shit was ...
i don &apos;t know , you gave me a look .
a look ?
so now you &apos;re a fucking mind reader ?
it won &apos;t happen again .
stop now , it &apos;ll be that much harder to get back on track .
your mother &apos;s right .
just out of curiosity , what are you planning on using for money ?
cheap tickets is running a sale .
i can cash in the bonds nana gave me , and most likely i &apos;ll be working .
some student film .
it &apos;s not a student film . it &apos;s a feature on dvcam .
alvar hangs out with dogme . he got honorable mention ...
at the winnipeg film festival last year , for his short .
forget money . what about security ?
you think traipsing around europe &apos;s a smart move these days ?
like europe &apos;s any less safe than here ?
look , you don &apos;t seem to get it .
i keep having images of jackie aprile lying
in a pool of his own blood ... in some street somewhere .
so what ? french discos drive away all sad thoughts ?
what , mom , you &apos;ve never heard of the restorative nature of travel ?
read henry james .
why does every college have junior year abroad if there isn &apos;t a need for it ?
then why don &apos;t you wait for junior year ? it &apos;s eight months .
&apos;cause i need it now .
you want to go to europe ? go .
clear your head . run with the bulls .
do whatever it is the hell they do over there .
thank you . i will .
don &apos;t you think she should talk to someone first ? a counselor , maybe ?
maybe the college of hard knocks is what she needs .
let &apos;s see how she likes it when a gypsy lifts her wallet .
or learn you can &apos;t work without a permit ...
which the french hang on to like their balls .
thank you for that united front .
the more we object , the more she &apos;ll want to go . you know her .
she &apos;s going . i don &apos;t understand you , with this flip @-@ flop .
she &apos;ll meet other boys . maybe an italian boy ,
an actual italian one . jackie &apos;ll stop playing a big part ...
you would want her married to a foreigner ?
married , no ! jesus !
although , look at furio . what &apos;s so bad about him ?
you do what you want ...
but i am not gonna stand idle while she throws her education away .
what are you gonna do ?
she &apos;s not gonna take this drastic step without talking to someone first .
come on .
dr. melfi &apos;s person is an educational consultant .
maybe she can explain to her how dropping out now ...
is not going to look at all good to medical schools .
we could use an ally here ...
some adult , besides us , to toe the line for accountability and responsibility .
so maybe you go on an anti @-@ depressant to tide you over .
you &apos;re not paying for it .
i don &apos;t know . maybe .
anyway , it was supposed to be his funeral .
jack &apos;s ?
and they all stood around ... drinking and blubbering ...
at these egregious , saccharine , fucking italian ballads .
it was revolting .
after i left the restaurant , i actually vomited .
you were drinking .
smoked a joint with my friends , too .
that &apos;s okay .
as long as you didn &apos;t deliberately purge .
when i asked you earlier what dad does for a living ... you said :
&quot; waste management , wink , wink . &quot; what does &quot; wink , wink &quot; mean ?
okay .
he &apos;s like ...
you know ?
you mentioned jack &apos;s father was in the mafia .
i didn &apos;t realize your dad was , too .
there &apos;s no such thing as the mafia .
i said jackie &apos;s dad was a loan shark .
how did dad react when he heard jack had been killed ?
he was pretty upset .
he used to tell jackie all the time , &quot; don &apos;t get involved . stay in school . &quot;
&quot; get involved &quot; ?
with what ?
drugs .
right .
so , dad was a positive force in jack &apos;s life .
jackie .
yeah .
you don &apos;t like talking much about dad , do you ?
he doesn &apos;t bother me .
i &apos;m gonna ask you a question about dad .
this may be very painful for you .
did dad ever molest you ?
no .
i don &apos;t tell them what we discuss .
i don &apos;t think so .
what about mom ?
god , no !
unless you consider obsessing about my fucking gpa an assault , which i do .
she has to learn that education is a lifelong process .
that &apos;s what i told them .
a college degree is a nice thing , sure ,
but not at the sake of emotional well @-@ being .
that &apos;s exactly what i said .
perhaps they should examine their own needs to have you stay in school .
blow off their self @-@ esteem issues .
so , you book on columbia , you can come back when you &apos;re ready .
or i could write you a letter to the university of barcelona .
it &apos;s a hot school .
i &apos;m on a consultancy there .
busy out there ?
bachelor party .
some asshole just slipped on a lime wedge .
i was talking to patsy .
sounds like chrissy &apos;s got a little napoleon thing going on .
yeah ?
good .
right .
of course . nobody &apos;s denying his leadership abilities .
so , what &apos;s the problem ?
it &apos;s just ...
i don &apos;t know . patsy feels bad , maybe he was passed over .
what the fuck do you care ?
last year , you were pushing me to take him out .
i &apos;m just saying , with the change of rank and all ... maybe he feels ...
marginalized .
marginalized ?
what the fuck does that even mean ?
i like your pants . leather ?
yeah . i got them at bebe .
fucking packed tonight !
let &apos;s celebrate .
no , thanks . i &apos;m gonna stick with the champagne .
it &apos;s primo shit , danny . we got an awesome connection .
it &apos;s okay .
so , i was thinking , right ?
what we do is start our own group .
i &apos;ll be the singer , and you two can back me up .
please .
right .
what ? it &apos;s so hard to rap ?
my bitch , my ho , my ho my bitch , my bitch , bitch
what ? it &apos;s a joke ?
stop !
you don &apos;t wanna back me up ?
stop !
god .
that &apos;s gorgeous .
isn &apos;t it ?
christopher gave it to me .
you like it , baby ?
what are you doing ?
what ?
i &apos;m gonna go .
what ? hang out . what &apos;s the matter ?
i &apos;ll call you tomorrow .
you piece of fucking shit !
what the fuck ?
i saw what you did . what &apos;d you think ? you were gonna fuck the two of us ?
you and those fucking videos !
she came onto me !
she took my hand , she was rubbing it on herself .
bullshit !
how about right before you came over ?
she was telling me where she buys her pants .
her fucking underwear and shit . fucking bebe &apos;s , like i give a fuck .
i thought you said she was gay .
who knows what her problem is ?
broad like her will fuck a snake . use your head .
what do i want with that skank , when i got you ?
you were saying she had a nice ass .
i was trying to say something positive , &apos; cause she &apos;s your friend .
come here .
what have i been telling you about this pucchiachia ?
she &apos;s trying to fuck us up , adriana .
and what we have is stronger than any of that shit .
i &apos;m sorry .
son of a fucking bitch .
what happened to the crazy glue ?
somebody left the top off . dried out .
what &apos;d you want ?
nothing , really .
you should see the floor tiles , though ...
that got delivered to the job site . mexican travertine .
johnny sposato will take that shit .
no more dipping at the job , according to fucking alfalfa .
but the order comes down from tony .
go ahead .
what ?
knock off the tile ?
tony says no .
i got your back .
tony will be fine with it .
the rotor on the washing machine broke . carm said i could use yours .
clean out the filter this time . disgusting .
so , how &apos;s your love life ?
why don &apos;t you mind your goddamn business ?
it feels like it is my business ...
considering i had to haul your last boyfriend out of your kitchen in a hefty bag
you &apos;re a miserable fuck , you know that ?
you &apos;re just like ma .
oh , yeah ?
really . with your condescension and your sabotage .
for your information , ralph is a great guy .
trust me , i got more information than i need about him .
it &apos;s always something .
are you threatened by the fact that he has a sense of style ?
a sense of style ?
ralph lauren , collegiate ?
let me ask you a question . do i know this guy better than you ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m telling you he &apos;s no fucking good .
my happiness really drives you crazy , doesn &apos;t it ?
this reorganization of the bureau could be good for both of us .
lilac personal shopping .
five fucking messages , danielle ?
can &apos;t you take a hint ? stop fucking calling here .
sweetie , don &apos;t be like that .
&quot; sweetie , &quot; bullshit .
you &apos;re lucky i don &apos;t rip your ass .
i thought we were friends .
did you take his hand off your leg ? did you ?
i tried .
bullshit !
don &apos;t ever fucking call me anymore .
four fucking months of work .
maybe if we let her cool off .
she thinks i tried to seduce her fiance , dwight .
little shitbag that he is .
what now ?
do we set someone else up ?
and waste another five months getting in close ? her guard will be up anyway .
i think we should consider the undercover @-@ op a dead issue .
let &apos;s just bring her in , straight up .
still , in all , good work , ciccerone .
right . thanks .
you know what the problem is , right ?
she gave moltisanti a hard @-@ on .
so , what do we do ? hire only schifosas ?
you know , i had a dream about her the other night .
this boring cocksucker .

what did you talk about ?
she said i don &apos;t have to tell you or dad .
it &apos;s confidential .
this is what we pay $ 200 for ?
it was your idea . i only saw her out of a gesture of goodwill .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re so upset about .
it &apos;s my right to go to europe . that &apos;s what she said .
i don &apos;t care what she said . she &apos;s totally irresponsible .
what ?
the therapist told her it is her right to go to europe .
she actually thinks this is a good idea ?
she said it &apos;s no big deal . i can pick up my education wherever , whenever .
really ?
wendi said she can get me into school in barcelona if i decide to stay .
who &apos;s wendi ?
dr. wendi kobler .
barcelona .
i could take melfi &apos;s head and crush it like a fucking walnut .
i feel battered .
i &apos;ve gotta get to the salon .
did you tell wendi that you didn &apos;t work all summer ?
wait , you &apos;re right .
i forgot to mention the pivotal role of the work ethic in this family .
you can lose that smart mouth right now .
or what ? what is this , afghanistan ?
i &apos;m over 18 now , i &apos;m a grown woman . i can go where i want and do what i want .
all right , jesus , god , we know that ! is that your only point here ?
because just getting what you want is for babies , not adults .
it may interest you to know she thinks i should probably be on prozac .
she does ?
she said that ?
jackie was murdered . i know you think ...
it &apos;s nothing screaming my head off at the columbia @-@ army game wouldn &apos;t cure .
that is so unfair .
all right , look .
i &apos;ve been thinking about this .
now , you &apos;re a smart girl . the right move for you is to wait .
just till next year , maybe .
you know what i don &apos;t understand , dad ?
you were all in favor of me going .
your mother doesn &apos;t want it .

what do you mean ?
what do i mean ? what do you mean ?
all these innuendoes . you inferring i didn &apos;t do everything i could ...
you inferring i didn &apos;t do everything i could to
keep that kid from fucking himself up ?
that , knowing him and his family ...
that i didn &apos;t try to be a better dad to him
than his own dad ? god rest his soul .
that i didn &apos;t try to protect jackie junior ? that i didn &apos;t smack him around ,
&apos;cause i was so frustrated ? is that what you &apos;re trying to tell me ?
i &apos;m through telling people you help with environmental cleanup .

and i assure you , it &apos;s in your best interest .

not at this time , but that can all change momentarily .
that &apos;s a search warrant . your office , your club , your cocaine .
it &apos;s not my cocaine .

i told you shit in confidence that had nothing to do with any of this shit !
things that i never told no one .

of course not .
&apos;cause patsy says you gave the okay .
this is after chrissy talked to him .
timeline got fucked up .
we go back a long way .

if in any way you feel like ...
chrissy usurped you or anything like that , and you &apos;re trying to read me ...

misunderstanding .
