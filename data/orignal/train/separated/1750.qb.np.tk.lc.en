have you guys heard about this research team
that &apos;s trying to genetically manipulate chicken dna
to create some sort of a chicken dinosaur ?
i think that sounds wonderful .
what ? you &apos;re afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens .
yes , but tell me
a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich
wouldn &apos;t hit the mesozoic spot .
hey , guys .
hey . hello .
we still on for tomorrow night ?
yeah . i &apos;m excited to finally meet your girlfriend .
yeah , oh , and speaking of which .
according to a recent study out of oxford university ,
when someone takes on a new romantic partner ,
that person loses one or two close friends .
since when do you read social science ?
i go to the bathroom like everybody else .
why would i lose friends just because i started dating someone ?
yeah , you didn &apos;t lose anyone when you met amy .
yeah , well , no , the study refers to romantic partners .
not the way i would categorize the two of us .
you guys kiss and hold hands .
i &apos;ve seen him do it . it &apos;s not romantic .
look , i &apos;m not the kind of guy
who drops his friends just because he &apos;s in a relationship .
what happens if she doesn &apos;t like us ?
well , hey , you &apos;re my dear friends .
you &apos;ll get a christmas card for a couple of years ,
and then you &apos;re dead to me .
so , howard , is stuart still living with your mom ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
but he &apos;s going to .
my mom got him cable !
in my whole life ,
growing up in that house-- no cable .
do you know how many hbos
that leech had my mother get him ? seven .
seven hbos . seven !
long story short , they have seven hbos .
hey , guys .
hello .
emily , you know almost everybody here .
hi .
this is leonard , this is penny .
oh , it &apos;s so nice to meet you .
nice to finally meet you , too .
hi .
hello .
well , raj , you were not lying about her .
i told you she exists .
hey , i hear you &apos;re a dermatologist .
uh , yeah , i &apos;m a resident at huntington hospital .
oh , i like their emergency room .
yeah , even if it turns out you don &apos;t have dengue fever ,
they still let you take a lollipop .
you know , penny just started training
to be a pharmaceutical sales rep .
maybe she can practice on you some time .
oh , it would be great to practice on a real doctor .
yeah . i &apos;m sure that &apos;d be fine .
i have some odd freckles on my buttocks .
can i make an appointment for you to look at them ?
um ... okay , i guess .
i &apos;m with him three years , nothing .
she &apos;s with two minutes , and he &apos;s taking his pants off .
last night was fun . what did you think of emily ?
i don &apos;t know .
i kind of got the sense she didn &apos;t like me .
did she say she didn &apos;t like you ?
of course not . no one ever says
they don &apos;t like you straight to your face .
we have led different lives .
you guys just met . why would she feel that way ?
it &apos;s just this vibe i got .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re worried about nothing .
yeah . you &apos;re probably right .
i used to think my high school p.e. teacher didn &apos;t like me ,
but it turned out , she liked me a little too much .
really ?
yeah .
it was fine .
we went to a melissa etheridge concert ,
也是积极参与同志权利运动的社会活动家
i got an a , it all worked out .
when you go to emily &apos;s office to practice , you &apos;ll see . it &apos;s fine .
yeah , i hope you &apos;re right .
you really went your entire life
without anyone saying &quot; i hate you &quot; to your face ?
yeah .
i &apos;d say it now , but look at those cheekbones .
i miss stuart &apos;s place .
all this loud music and exposed brick .
what , is this a comic book store ,
or a rave at the third little pig &apos;s house ?
yup , i wish stuart would reopen .
i hate this place , too .
okay , him i believe
because he &apos;s an 80 @-@ year @-@ old man in a 15 @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s t @-@ shirt .
but you &apos;re just upset about
stuart and your mom and all their hbos .
yes , i am .
you know , i can &apos;t even watch game of thrones now
without thinking of mother saying ,
&quot; stuart , which one is thrones ? &quot;
you know , he might not reopen .
he didn &apos;t get a lot of money from the insurance company .
oh , boy , if there is one thing that gets my goat ,
it &apos;s those dad @-@ gum insurance companies .
why ? because they won &apos;t get off your lawn ?
oh , is stuart trying to get a loan , or @-@ or find investors ?
all i know is , he &apos;s got my mother
buying four @-@ ply toilet paper .
i mean , four @-@ ply .
if his butt is so delicate ,
why doesn &apos;t he just use an angora rabbit ?
是一种高级纺织原料
for starters , they shed and bite .
hey , here &apos;s a thought .
why don &apos;t we put up the rest of the money that stuart needs ?
so , we &apos;d be , like , owners of a comic book store ?
it &apos;s kind of a dream come true .
that does sound fun .
ooh , maybe we could come up
with a business plan to compete with this place .
i &apos;ll give you a plan right now .
step one : open comic book store .
step two : start rumor
this comic book store gives you genital warts .
step three : buy a big bag to put the money in .
it &apos;s not that bad .
thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you .
i really appreciate it .
sure .
um , i brought coffee .
i wasn &apos;t sure what you like , so i got
a regular , a cappuccino and a chai tea .
since you like raj , i thought you might be into that .
thanks . if we could get started . i &apos;m a little busy .
oh , yeah , sure . let me just get out my materials .
leonard gave me this briefcase .
he used to carry it around in high school .
you can still see the dent where they whacked him with it .
okay , i would like to talk to you
about our new birth control pill , femevra .
great .
so , femevra &apos;s triphasic design
含有三种不同比例的雌激素与黄体素
provides balanced hormonal exposure .
all right .
it has also been shown to cause
significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives .
although it can cause acne , which , if you ask me , kind of
increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive .
funny .
okay , i &apos;m sorry . did we get off on the wrong foot ?
because since the other night , i kind of feel like
you might have a problem with me .
no , it &apos;s fine .
are you sure , because it doesn &apos;t seem fine ?
okay .
if you really want to talk about this ,
i do have a problem .
oh , my god . tell me-- what did i do ?
look , it &apos;s nothing . it &apos;s just ...
raj told me that a while ago , you two hooked up .
what ? ! oh , why would he say that ?
did it not happen ?
well , i wouldn &apos;t exactly call it a hook @-@ up .
did you kiss ?
yeah .
were you naked ?
yeah .
so , it was a hook @-@ up .
no .
yeah .
so , what are some ways we could set our comic book store
apart from the competition ?
oh , kids buy comic books . it would be great
to figure out a way to get more kids in the store .
you know , when i was a kid , i loved going there ,
but i could never get a ride .
ooh , what if we got a van
and drove around and picked kids up ?
nice .
you mean , like at parks and schools ?
toy stores , puppet shows .
hold on . so , your idea is to get a van
and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up ?
yes .
and are you gonna use candy to lure them in ?
we are now !
you told emily we hooked up ? !
um , well , in my defense , i tell everybody .
why would you say that ? !
we were having a conversation about past lovers .
we weren &apos;t lovers ! come on .
everyone knows we didn &apos;t sleep together .
we got drunk and fooled around .
why couldn &apos;t you just leave me out of it ?
well , we were being honest .
you would leave me out of the conversation
with the next guy if you dump leonard ?
why say it ?
yes !
well , i would never leave you off my list ,
and not just because , without you ,
we &apos;re playing fast and loose with the word &quot; list . &quot;
well , good job . now she hates me .
great .
on the bright side , that oxford study was right .
one friend down .
i wonder who you &apos;re going to lose next .
you , okay ? it &apos;s you . you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re next !
no . you &apos;re crazy about me .
i don &apos;t know what emily &apos;s so upset about anyway .
even if i had slept with him , so what ?
everyone has a past .
almost everyone has a past .
come on , look how pretty you are .
i &apos;m sure this isn &apos;t the first girl to hate you .
it &apos;s not .
and i &apos;m sure you can turn it around .
how ? you can &apos;t force someone to like you .
what if you just hang around and act like her friend
until you wear her down ?
i mean , next thing you know , you &apos;re in her home ,
you &apos;re eating her food , drinking her wine .
no , that won &apos;t work .
you &apos;re right . cheers .
oh , i know .
why don &apos;t you use your sales training
to go back down there and sell yourself ?
what ?
yeah .
but instead of selling a drug ,
you &apos;d be selling penny-- it &apos;s cute .
it &apos;s stupid .
well , maybe people would like you more
if you didn &apos;t crap all over their ideas .
i &apos;m gonna go with penny on this one .
then again , why wouldn &apos;t i ? i mean , we go way back .
oh , my god . i didn &apos;t used to like you .
shh . amy &apos;s here now .
you know , the more i think about it ,
the more intrigued i am about having our own store .
we &apos;ll get to see all the new stuff
before it hits the shelves .
and we &apos;ll get to have fun interactions with our customers .
&quot; this isn &apos;t a library-- buy it or get out . &quot;
you say things like that all the time .
yes , but as a store owner ,
i &apos;ll finally have a good comeback to ,
&quot; you don &apos;t work here-- shut up . &quot;
uh , do you know how penny told raj he should have
left her off his list ?
yeah .
well , do you think when she and i had that conversation ,
she left people off her list ?
i &apos;m sure she did .
why ?
because if she hadn &apos;t ,
she &apos;d still be wading through the list .
will you stay out of this ?
if only penny had said that once in a while .
hey , what difference does it make ?
you &apos;re the one she wants to marry .
that &apos;s true .
yeah , and i &apos;m not sure that complete honesty
is always the best thing for a relationship .
yeah , he &apos;s right .
once , in a moment of candor ,
i told amy that her hair reminded me
of a duck caught in an oil spill . well ...
she stormed out .
which was sad , because we were playing scrabble ,
and i had all the letters to spell &quot; persimmon . &quot;
why are you even part of this conversation ?
you don &apos;t know anything about women .
i know that if i had a wife or a fiance ,
i &apos;d ask her first before i invested money
in a comic book store .
he &apos;s right .
yeah , well , of course i am .
i was also right about her hair .
it did everything but quack .
there &apos;s something i wanted to run past you .
what &apos;s up ?
mm , the guys and i were thinking about
investing in stuart &apos;s comic book store .
is that okay ?
why are you asking me ?
well , you know , we &apos;re engaged ,
and it &apos;s kind of a big deal financially .
it seems like something we should talk about .
well , would you consider mounds of credit card debt
kind of a big deal financially ?
yeah .
so , me and the guys were talking about
this great investment opportunity ...
nope .
but you didn &apos;t hear what it was .
i know .
oh , come on .
fine . what is it ?
it &apos;s to help reopen the comic book store .
nope .
well , hear me out .
howard , you know we &apos;re saving up for a house .
i know , but all the guys are doing it .
we &apos;re splitting it four ways ,
so it &apos;s really not that much money .
it just seems like a risky investment .
i get that . i ...
okay , look ...
the reason this is important is ...
... before my dad left me and my mom ...
he used to ... take me to the comic book store .
it was one of the few things we did together .
oh . howie , i had no idea .
well , i don &apos;t ... like to talk about it .
oh , baby .
that story &apos;s made up , isn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s how much buying a comic book store means to me .
i &apos;d like your honest opinion on something .
of course .
now , before i start ,
i need you to know that i &apos;m very excited about this ,
and anything you say
that isn &apos;t enthusiastically supportive
will throw our entire relationship into question .
so ...
keep an open mind .
i &apos;m feeling a little backed into a corner , sheldon .
perfect . now ...
... i &apos;m considering investing
in stuart &apos;s comic book store .
interesting .
can you see how a grown man ,
an accomplished scientist ,
who invests in a store
that sells picture books
about flying men in colorful underwear ...
... might be wasting both his financial
and intellectual resources ?
no .
then i think it &apos;s a terrific idea .
great .
wait till you hear about our van .
thanks for inviting us over .
oh , thank you for coming .
uh , listen , penny , before you start ,
i just want to apologize for being so rude
the other day in my office .
no , no . no need to apologize .
excuse me , can i say something ?
i just love both you guys ,
and i want you to get along .
and when i say &quot; love , &quot; i meant as a friend .
and , uh , way too soon , right ?
okay , sit down . listen , emily ,
what happened between me and raj
was a long time ago .
it was ,
and i may have made it seem like a bigger deal than i should have .
yeah , and leonard and i are engaged now ,
and i &apos;m just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us .
i &apos;d like that , too .
yeah , i thought i &apos;d be okay with it ,
but then i saw how pretty you are .
oh , that &apos;s so sweet .
i mean , look at you-- you are gorgeous .
it &apos;s true-- you &apos;re both gorgeous .
kind of says something about the man who could bed you both .
you get why i &apos;ve been alone most of my adult life .
so , what brings you by ?
well , i don &apos;t need a reason-- it &apos;s my house .
technically , it &apos;s your mom &apos;s house , but ...
we certainly want you to feel welcome .
i &apos;m always welcome .
mm , just ... try and call first .
okay , let &apos;s get down to business .
howie was thinking about putting up some money
to help you reopen the store ,
but before that happens , i have a few questions .
i appreciate the offer ,
but actually your mother already gave me the money .
what ?
yeah . i told her it was too much ,
but she said she was happy to help out her bubala .
excuse me .
ma , you are canceling that check ,
and stuart is not your bubala ; i &apos;m your bubala .
you can &apos;t have more than one bubala !
i don &apos;t know who he &apos;s talking to .
she &apos;s at target , buying me shirts .
i &apos;m so glad we could work this all out .
yeah , me , too .
you know , we should have dinner one night with you and leonard .
oh , we would love that .
great !
okay , good night , guys .
all right , night .
bye .
i hate her .
i hate her .
i &apos;m really disappointed we &apos;re not gonna have
our own comic book store .
i know .
i was looking forward to it .
it would &apos;ve been so nice to have a place that was ours ,
where we could just sit and read comics in peace .
with comfy seats .
and snacks .
well , i guess it was too good to be true .
yeah .
