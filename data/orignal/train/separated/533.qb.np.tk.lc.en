tribute
help me .
louise .
ok .
it &apos;s ok . help is on the way .
no !
dreaming again ?
same one ?
maybe you should see a counselor .
it might help them to stop .
only one thing is going to help them to stop .
none of it was your fault . you know that .
baby , you can &apos;t go on like this .
you need your sleep .
i &apos;ll be fine .
yeah , i know .
that &apos;s what you keep saying .
go back to sleep .

no way .
are you ever going to turn that page ?
i haven &apos;t finished it yet .
you miss him , huh ?
yeah , me , too .
me three .
that &apos;s not a lot to go on , emily .
i know . but it &apos;s him . i know it is .
and now he &apos;s stateside .
people get shot in new york every day .
what makes you so sure ?
geography , m.o. , victimology ,
he copycats the classics--
chikatilo in russia , jack the ripper in london ,
last month it was the boston strangler .
now , it was a single homicide ,
so i thought maybe that was just me
trying to see something that wasn &apos;t there .
but now he &apos;s in new york copying the son of sam .
it &apos;s him . i know it &apos;s him .
berkowitz shot two people in that first son of sam murder .
you &apos;ve only got one victim here .
yes , but it happened in the same neighborhood in the bronx ,
and ballistics confirmed it was a .44 caliber bulldog
exactly like berkowitz used .
in boston he used nylon stockings to strangle an elderly woman
one block from where desalvo &apos;s first murder
took place back in 1962 .
we haven &apos;t been invited in by boston or nypd .
and you know the protocol gets tricky .
technically it &apos;s serial .
fbi has jurisdiction .
well , if you count the international kills , yes .
but we &apos;re gonna have to get permission from the doj .
good people died trying to catch this guy , hotch .
i need your help .
ok . we &apos;re somewhere over texas right now .
how soon can you meet us in new york ?
i &apos;m already on my way .
&quot; originality is nothing but judicious imitation . &quot;
voltaire .
what makes us so sure it &apos;s all the same guy ?
well , emily believes it &apos;s how precisely he &apos;s mimicking each crime .
‭ go ahead , garcia .
ok . this is all streaming to your tablets .
feel free to follow along .
i give you andrei chikatilo .
his first victim was in 1978 .
it was a 9 @-@ year @-@ old girl
whose body was discovered in the russian city of rostov .
she was sexually assaulted , strangled , and mutilated .
he also took eyeballs as trophies
and ate some of his victims &apos; organs .
ugh . i now give you 10 @-@ year @-@ old natasha dudechenko .
her body was discovered two years ago ,
also in rostov ,
roughly a mile away from
where the original body was found ,
and tragically in much the same condition .
the russian police apparently spotted a suspect
near the crime scene ,
but he eluded capture in the crowded train station .
chikatilo actually confessed to 56 murders committed between 1978 and 1990 .
well , the timeline and the body count
probably don &apos;t matter as much as
geography and the copying of the m.o.
it was the same last year in london .
it was , indeed . 3 women were discovered in whitechapel ,
which is a district in east london ,
all within a month ,
and all eviscerated a la mr. ripper .
the third victim was scotland yard .
and that &apos;s when emily almost got him
in that undercover operation .
if this is the same unsub ,
he would be incredibly rare .
he &apos;s both criminally and forensically sophisticated ,
and the fact that he &apos;s been able to function
and evade caption in 3 countries
means that he &apos;s highly intelligent
and almost certainly multilingual .
and he &apos;s got some money in his pocket , too .
travel takes financing .
lewis is flying in from an assignment in atlanta .
and we &apos;ll all connect with emily in new york .
well , it &apos;ll be good to see her again .
too bad it &apos;s gotta be like this .
excuse me , i &apos;m looking for an agent prentiss .
you found her .
hi . dr. tara lewis .
really happy to finally meet you .
i &apos;ve heard great things .
every bit of it &apos;s true .
i &apos;ve been looking forward to meeting you , too .
i see you got a head start .
two years worth .
i heard you almost got him in london .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m really sorry about what happened .
yeah , me , too .
were you close to the scotland yard inspector that got killed ?
no . i mean , i knew her , of course , but , uh , no .
there she is .
we missed you . how are you ?
good . good . it &apos;s so great to see you guys .
oh , brainiac , i love the do .
thank you for coming .
of course .
rossi and jj are headed to the crime scene .
i &apos;m assuming you want to join ?
you assume right .
you know , i can &apos;t believe it .
the whole ride down here , you didn &apos;t mention the guy once .
i &apos;m just saying .
what ? morgan ?
ok , guys , i &apos;m sorry . i was going to .
i was just giving you space .
i mean , he just left .
you must still be raw .
i remember leaving you guys both times .
i was heartbroken .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s gonna be ok .
he &apos;s with his family , and he &apos;s ... morgan .
how are you guys doing ? you holding up ?
yeah . i mean , some days are better than others .
actually , i was giving you a hard time
over your boyfriend mark .
wait--how do you know about mark ?
oh , come on , i &apos;ll give you one guess .
garcia .
you must be the feds .
i &apos;m mccleary . this is rollins .
i &apos;m ssa rossi .
this is agent jareau ,
agent prentiss here is with interpol .
this is it right over here .
what can you tell us about the victim ?
her name was camille harrison .
26 @-@ year @-@ old bartender from yonkers .
cause of death was a single gunshot wound to the head .
there was someone else in here .
see the blood spatter shadow on the passenger seat ?
yeah , we picked up on that .
figured the shooting was standing right here
outside the driver &apos;s side window
while ms. harrison was at the wheel .
you guys find any blood trails ?
no . but it rained last night .
it compromised the scene .
if someone else was here ,
that matches the m.o. of the son of sam murders .
berkowitz &apos;s first victims were
two girls he shot in a car .
yes , but one of them was only hit in the leg and survived .
but you &apos;re assuming there was a second victim .
we only got one stiff .
ok , but let &apos;s say somebody else was shot .
what would they do ?
i &apos;d get the hell out of the car and run .
yeah . and i &apos;d go this way .
that &apos;s where the closest busy street is .
so if i &apos;m hurt , maybe i stumble .
hello . i &apos;ve got something here .
do you have an evidence collection kit in your car ?
yeah . yeah , i do .
with obstacles at every turn ,
the great pacific salmon runs on , upstream ,
sometimes even uphill , but always onward .
with mother nature as his guide ,
he adapts from saltwater to fresh
and moves from the oceans to the rivers
to take the most important journey of his life--
the return home .
he follows the same route countless generations before him have ,
and this epic voyage culminates
in the very spot where life began .
and then , in what seems like a cruel twist ,
after they spawn , they die .
but there are no endings in the eternal cycle of life ,
only new beginnings .
oh , buddy , i remember why i missed you so much .
guys , i noticed a pattern .
the unsub only kills between the months of march and september .
makes sense . it &apos;s easier to move around in the summer months .
go ahead , garcia .
i have got absolutely nothing on my passport search .
i &apos;ve been trying to pinpoint travelers
who were in america , the u.k. ,
and russia at the time of the murders .
i have zero matches .
hey , we should also look at diplomats .
oh , my god . oh , my god , it &apos;s you , hi !
hey , you .
oh , my god ! you &apos;re here !
you &apos;re here here , but you &apos;re in the country here .
i miss you .
how are you ?
garcia .
oh ! yes , sorry . uh ...
diplomats . explain .
well , what if he &apos;s part of some kind of diplomatic envoy ?
someone attached to an embassy
would have money and could travel with ease .
not to mention diplomatic immunity .
it would also explain being multi @-@ lingual .
still would have to go through customs , though .
i got a match .
it &apos;s not really a match .
why not ?
because i don &apos;t think our unsub
is his excellency dr. sanjay shah ,
61 @-@ year @-@ old indian ambassador to the u.k.
he was in london at the right time ,
but he &apos;s currently speaking
at a climate control conference in miami .
guys , we got a woman who was shot
in the leg in the bronx .
claims she was mugged , but she was in the area at the right time .
hi . monica ?
my name &apos;s jennifer . this is emily .
we &apos;re with the fbi .
do you mind if we ask you a few questions ?
fbi ? i already talked to the cops .
we &apos;ll be quick . promise .
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m going anywhere .
ok . can you tell us how you got shot ?
some white dude mugged me .
took my purse , my phone .
shot me in the leg .
i already told the cops all of this .
can &apos;t you just talk to them ?
ok , monica , look , i &apos;m gonna keep this 100
because i don &apos;t have a lot of time .
have you ever heard of interpol ?
no .
it &apos;s an international police organization .
and i &apos;m talking like 190 countries .
we help cops all over the world .
wait . she said you were fbi .
i am . but i &apos;m also attached to interpol .
and part of my job is to hunt down serial killers .
for real ?
for real .
the guy i &apos;m looking for
i have tracked all the way from russia
to england to here .
so far he &apos;s killed 6 people that we know of .
the youngest was a 10 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
the oldest was a 72 @-@ year @-@ old grandmother .
oh , my god .
so tell me what really happened to you .
please ... if my father finds out ...
he &apos;s not here .
ok ? it &apos;s just us .
tell us what really happened .
uh , we pulled over .
his girlfriend was driving ,
he got out of the backseat of the car ,
and then i heard this bang .
her blood was everywhere .
it was all over me .
ok , ok . let &apos;s start at the beginning .
how did you meet him ?
he--he texted me from my internet ad .
i escort sometimes , but only when i really need the money .
do you remember his name ?
mike .
he was trying to hook up a threesome with his girlfriend .
i don &apos;t do that .
but he said he &apos;d give me 300 just to show up .
i thought he was gonna rob me .
but he just shot me and walked away .
did he have an accent ?
could you tell where he was from ?
no . he was from here .
he was american .
nypd doubled their patrols in queens ,
where berkowitz hunted next .
he may not try to hit queens .
he only copycatted one murder in boston before he moved on .
maybe now that he &apos;s back home in the states ,
he &apos;s accelerating for some reason or another .
it might be because
we have so many serial killers to choose from .
so the cell phone he texted monica dejesus with was a burner .
you know , somehow he managed to talk camille harrison
into a threesome with a prostitute .
this guy must be quite the charmer .
you are not kidding . the amount of germs exchanged
in a situation like that could be astronomical .
well , maybe camille was into that kind of thing .
fair enough . but the unsub barely knew her .
we would have had calls , texts , something .
everyone she was in touch with checks out .
and he let monica live .
copying the m.o. was so important to him ,
he needed to keep one of them alive .
one of our squads thinks they spotted someone
that matches your guy &apos;s description .
he entered a warehouse in queens .
clear .
clear !
clear .
clear .
clear .
we &apos;re clear over here .
clear .
clear .
that &apos;s the whole building .
he &apos;s not here .
agents , mccleary here .
we found something about a block over .
damn it !
we almost had him .
victims are trent and rhonda klein , both 46 .
trent was a corporate lawyer , rhonda was an ad exec .
survived by their two daughters .
how old ?
12 and 10 .
.44 caliber .
but he uses a bulldog revolver .
it doesn &apos;t eject shells , and it only holds 5 rounds .
ok , i know we need to wait for the m.e. &apos; s report ,
but i count 7 different entry wounds .
she &apos;s got at least 6 .
so he had to reload twice .
berkowitz didn &apos;t do that .
and he was a misogynist .
the only man he shot was a guy with long hair
that he thought was a woman .
this unsub &apos;s out of control , and this is overkill .
so what was it about these two that made him lose it ?
well , he could be evolving ,
finally figuring out what it is he really likes .
what is that ?
that is a rolex .
why so angry all of a sudden ?
you know , this is an expensive car .
and those princess @-@ cut diamonds in her ears
are at least a carat each ,
but he didn &apos;t take any of it .
we profile he has money . he doesn &apos;t need those things .
yeah , but these are the first victims that actually had money .
look what he did .
he punished them .
so maybe it &apos;s some kind of self @-@ loathing thing .
or maybe we got it wrong .
i mean , just because the guy &apos;s educated and multi @-@ lingual
doesn &apos;t mean he comes from money .
maybe it &apos;s exactly the opposite .
maybe he hates people with money .
we should deliver the profile .
the man we &apos;re looking for is a narcissistic copycat killer .
typically , copycats have identity issues and low confidence ,
which is why they emulate others .
but this guy &apos;s different .
confidence is the one thing he &apos;s full of .
he is brazenly replicating high @-@ profile murderers
and he &apos;s doing it globally .
he is only active between march and september ,
which means he has to do something
between october and february to bankroll it all .
probably a cash business .
that way he doesn &apos;t leave a paper trail .
given his skill set ,
we &apos;re thinking thief , drug dealer ,
maybe even organized crime .
because we got close to him ,
he &apos;s probably already on the move .
he &apos;s extremely mobile ,
so canvass airports , train , and bus stations .
his fascination with serial crime
is deeply embedded in his psyche and part of what drives him .
which means he was probably
exposed to serial crime at a young age .
he may have been a victim , related to a victim ,
or even connected to a perpetrator .
unfortunately , there &apos;s no doubt he &apos;ll strike again .
it &apos;s just a matter of who he decides to copy next .
it &apos;s not polite to stare , you know .
are you bored ?
yeah , me , too .
it &apos;s a long ride .
coming or going ?
going to see my grandpa .
well , that &apos;s good .
family &apos;s important .
where &apos;s your dad ?
i only stay at his house some weekends .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a bullet .
that one &apos;s lucky .
want to know why ?
because it doesn &apos;t have your name on it .
yeah , i &apos;ve had that dream many times myself .
bullets just bounce right off of him .
i keep firing and he keeps coming .
i always wake up right before he grabs me .
i &apos;m literally losing sleep here .
some cases just stick with you .
makes sense that this one &apos;s important .
i just wish i can flip a switch or something to control it .
the only way to control it is to surrender to it .
if i do that , then i have to face the fact
that i might never catch this guy .
yeah , but by that logic ,
you also have to face the fact that you might .
one thing you can &apos;t do is blame yourself .
for any of it .
yeah .
easier said than done , you know ?
tell me about it .
guys .
i found something .
if the unsub has moved on ,
i was trying to discern where he might go .
based on the time of death of his most recent victims ,
i was able to estimate just how far he could get .
now , if he &apos;s somehow managed to get on an airplane , however ,
he could be anywhere in the world right now .
kennedy , la guardia ,
and newark are heavily covered .
it &apos;d be hard to get through that net .
exactly . so his most likely mode of transport
would be a train , a bus , or a car .
i looked at departure schedules ,
i factored in possible travel speeds ,
and it appears to me he could not have gotten past this .
that &apos;s a lot of real estate to cover .
what &apos;s the deal with these ?
each of these represents the most famous killer
of the past 150 years .
wow , look at chicago .
i went as far back as the 1890s with h.h holmes ,
then the lipstick killer in the 1940s , william heirens .
we of course also have to consider al capone
and the st. valentine &apos;s day massacre
and richard speck and john wayne gacy .
i &apos;m assuming that &apos;s jeffrey dahmer nearby in milwaukee ?
yes . and this is ed gein .
well , if you wanted to copycat a famous serial killer , it looks like
chicago would be the place to be .
welcome to chicago .
if you have any luggage ,
please line up on the right side of the bus .
get your stuff together , baby , we &apos;re here .
got to go to the bathroom ?
no .
jj ...
help me . help me .
no , jj , no .
no , no , no , no , no , jj .
just hang on .
help is coming . please , hang in there .
emily ...
you had him , emily .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry .
emily . emily .
emily .
emily .
emily !
i &apos;m up .
i &apos;m up .
why are you guys all staring ?
you were dreaming . the same one ?
yeah .
only jj was in it this time .
tara , remember when you asked me
if i was close to the inspector who was killed ?
yeah .
i lied .
her name was louise holland ,
and i was the one who suggested she volunteer to go undercover .
i told her it would be good for her career .
and we needed more women in power positions .
emily , it &apos;s--it &apos;s ok .
but it was my profile .
the whole operation , it was my idea .
you never told us that .
well , i &apos;m telling you now .
she &apos;s dead because of me .
emily ,
she volunteered . you have to remember that .
but i talked her into it .
the chief inspector hated the idea .
he thought it was too risky .
and i went above his head to push it through .
i just ... i thought we &apos;d catch him .
you almost did .
almost .
excuse me , but can you please tell me
where mason hall is ?
you &apos;re looking at it .
you &apos;re kidding .
i must have walked by it 3 times .
thank you .
i &apos;m mike .
megan .
congratulations .
you are officially the first student i &apos;ve met .
new professor . my first day .
nice watch .
thanks .
oh , you know mason hall is a girls dorm , right ?
yeah . i &apos;m supposed to meet one of my teaching assistants .
just making sure you didn &apos;t mean mason science building .
totally different .
there &apos;s actually a mason athletic center , too , right ?
there is .
yeah . guess that mason family
must have had a little bit of money , huh ?
thanks again , megan . enjoy the rest of your day .
you , too .
don &apos;t give me that look . i &apos;m fine .
oh , i know .
but ... i can also tell you &apos;re holding something back ,
because you don &apos;t want us to think you &apos;re crazy .
emily , we already think you &apos;re crazy .
thank you .
come on , what &apos;s going in in there ?
well , that night in london ,
he had me and he just walked away and let me live .
you weren &apos;t part of his plan .
his need to copy specific aspects of the murders was compulsive .
i thought that , too . and ...
maybe it &apos;s just the nightmare talking ,
but i could swear he was savoring it .
well , a close call like that .
it &apos;s gotta be a rush .
maybe all those near misses weren &apos;t an accident .
he might like it when we &apos;re close .
so he &apos;s a thrill killer .
maybe he gets off on the adrenaline .
what have you got , garcia ?
sir , i connected to law enforcement surveillance feeds nationwide ,
and i used our sketch
to start official recognition search .
i got this , which is streaming to your tablets now .
it was taken two hours ago
by a chicago pd camera outside a bus station .
a bus left new york at 8 : 30 last night .
it was due in chicago at 11 : 00 this morning .
so , i am running a search with the new image .
it &apos;s a national database . it &apos;s gonna take a while .
garcia , let &apos;s narrow the search by region .
it &apos;s likely that this unsub grew up
in an area near a high @-@ profile serial murder ,
so let &apos;s concentrate on california ,
illinois , and surrounding states .
copy that . that helps .
but this program is literally cycling through millions of faces .
ok , so what-- what are we missing here ?
well , you said he was savoring it .
so what if this really is all about the thrill ?
it would be hard for a guy like that
to just shut off over the winter ,
so what is he doing during his down time to feed that urge ?
well , we profiled something criminal .
well , if he was a drug dealer or a thief ,
don &apos;t you think he would have stolen that rolex
instead of shoving it down that guy &apos;s throat ?
ok , then there would be
seasonal and lucrative and probably high risk .
he could be some kind of hunting or adventure guide .
maybe on mountain climbing expeditions or at ski resorts ?
ok . narrowing search .
could be an oil rig worker .
i &apos;m pretty sure they sign short @-@ term contracts .
got it .
wait a minute . the knife .
what knife ?
the unsub &apos;s knife in the nightmare .
it &apos;s long and serrated on one edge ,
and it has a leather lanyard thing wrapped around his wrist .
that sounds like a fisherman &apos;s knife .
exactly . this might be a stretch ,
but what if he &apos;s a fisherman ?
crab season is from october to february .
and it &apos;s highly lucrative ,
considering you only work a few months a year .
yeah . and it &apos;s also dangerous .
perfect for a thrill seeker .
got it , got it , got it , got it . all right .
technology &apos;s working .
good things come to those who wait .
don &apos;t look at toast while it &apos;s cooking . that &apos;s sort of thing .
shut the front door .
i give you 35 @-@ year @-@ old michael lee peterson
of joliet , illinois .
he &apos;s back in his hometown .
that could mean this is his endgame .
tell us everything , garcia .
uh , mr. peterson works as a deck hand on a crab fishing vessel
in the bering sea known as &quot; neptune &apos;s squall . &quot;
he was raised by his mother lorraine .
she died of a stroke 10 years ago .
his father vincent was an armed robber . he died two years ago .
that was right around the time of those first murders in russia .
that could have been the trigger .
garcia , where &apos;d the father serve his time ?
uh , mostly stateville penitentiary .
richard speck and john wayne gacy were both incarcerated there .
so which one is he planning to copycat ?
well , speck systematically raped and murdered 8 student nurses
in their dormitory in a single night .
if he &apos;s a serial killer looking for a thrill ,
that would do the trick .
garcia , coordinate with the chicago field office
and put out an apb for peterson .
all over it , sir . all over it .
oh , my--god !
you scared the crap out of me !
yeah , well , maybe you should close your doors
so people can &apos;t sneak in .
i was waiting for you .
i guess you didn &apos;t see this tweet .
i see a lot of tweets .
from the school ?
about the serial killer ?
what ?
yeah .
the fbi put out a warning .
probably another kook with an assault rifle .
oh , there &apos;s a picture of the guy .
they want us to stay inside and travel in groups .
oh , my god .
i know , right ?
no , i saw him today .
shut up .
he was right outside .
he told me he was a new teacher .
wait , seriously ?
i swear .
i &apos;m not kidding . i swear .
um , here , uh ,
there &apos;s a number it says to call .
you sure ?
here . you should talk .
fbi hotline .
hello ?
i think i saw the man that you &apos;re looking for .
what &apos;s your name ?
megan . megan ross .
where are you ?
i &apos;m a student at northeast state .
put the phone down , megan .
now .
are you there ?
given he recent shift in m.o. ,
there &apos;s a chance that peterson may not
copy every aspect of speck &apos;s murders .
you know , you &apos;re right . he could actually
start selecting affluent targets .
speck hit a nursing home on the south side .
most of the money in chicago is on the north side .
what have you got , garcia ?
sir , i got ahold of stateville visitor logs
and it looks like peterson and his mom visited every weekend ,
until his dad was transferred for his own safety .
so peterson may have even seen speck when he was a kid .
wait . garcia , for his own safety ? what happened ?
uh , let &apos;s see . it looks like peterson &apos;s dad
agreed to testify against his former partner
and he was almost stabbed to death .
well , in prison , snitches are worse off than child molesters .
serial killers , on the other hand ,
top of the food chain .
kids are like sponges .
he spent a lot of time visiting .
peterson probably witnessed that dynamic .
which would obviously contribute
to his idolization of high @-@ profile killers .
he wants the respect that his father never got .
and he was kicked out of 4 schools , all for fighting .
19 : 30 东北州立大学
guys , uh , we just got a call on the hotline .
it was a hang @-@ up so it could be a prank ,
but apparently a student at
northeast state university spotted peterson .
send the location .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
you ok ?
megan ?
if you scream , she dies .
agents ! swat &apos;s 10 minutes out
and we got more backup en route .
we need all the exits covered .
‭ you got it .
shots fired !
we can &apos;t wait !
all right , we &apos;re going in . tell swat we &apos;re going in .
dave , you take the front , we &apos;ll take the back .
who &apos;s next ?
you ?
you .
decisions . decisions .
get back in your room and stay there !
no !
you win .
rich girl .
no ! no !
let her go !
let her go !
‭ let her go !
no ! let her !
no !
help us ! please ! he &apos;s gonna kill her !
it &apos;s ok .
michael lee peterson , fbi .
get back . i swear to god i &apos;ll blow her head off .
ok , ok . it &apos;s all good .
back up !
sorry , i can &apos;t do that .
shut up !
please !
shut up .
you don &apos;t remember me , do you , michael ?
we met in london .
you followed me all the way here .
i must be a big deal .
you &apos;re already going to be the man when you get to prison .
just let her go , you &apos;ll be on the news at 10 : 00 .
look outside .
