check it out .
it &apos;s alison &apos;s color .
you cannot seriously think that
a blind girl broke into my house .
i didn &apos;t say that jenna was alone .
let &apos;s not go to the toby place , okay ?
you guys think her guide dog
left behind his lipstick ?
do you like the color ?
she lives in this town .
i have to see her . i have to talk to her .
do you think they &apos;re gonna work this out ?
i really don &apos;t know .
if we are not gonna answer any more questions ,
let me get in the office and see what i can find .
psychotherapy .
you &apos;re her therapist !
you and i have very different ideas of what &apos;s friendly .
that &apos;s an angry serve .
if you want to take someone else to homecoming ,
sean , you should .
why would i do that ?
it &apos;s not like i &apos;d actually go with anyone else .
pretty . who made that ?
somebody from school .
well , whoever made it must like you a lot .
dude , you are so screwed .
when this is all over , she &apos;s gonna get her diploma .
you &apos;re gonna get a pink slip and an orange jumpsuit .
how many of your friends did you tell ?
i didn &apos;t .
&apos;cause if &quot; a &quot; knows ,
i &apos;m thinking &quot; b &quot; and &quot; c &quot; and everybody else does , too .
what are you doing ?
an intervention .
we brought takeout and rag mags .
but you cannot have any of those
until you get out of these sweats .
what &apos;s wrong with these ?
nothing .
except they &apos;re starting to graft to your skin .
well , they &apos;re comfy .
so are mom jeans and platform flip @-@ flops .
plus , how are we gonna help you choose a homecoming dress
if you don &apos;t try some on for us ?
that &apos;s easy . i &apos;m not going .
what do you mean you &apos;re not going ?
you can &apos;t just not go .
what are you doing instead ?
i don &apos;t know . i guess i &apos;ll just read these
and then inhale a gallon of chunky monkey .
hey , look , cutting yourself off from the rest of your life
is not gonna help your parents .
and besides , they still might work it out .
they &apos;re barely speaking to each other .
people get angry .
they blow up .
doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s over .
emily , they didn &apos;t blow up
over her dad missing their anniversary .
he slept with one of his students .
sorry .
i &apos;m just saying things can look over on friday ,
and by monday all is forgiven .
some things just take time .
yeah , maybe .
okay , so you &apos;re coming ! come on !
god ...
i &apos;ll think about it .
if you &apos;re not coming ,
can you at least cast an absentee ballot ?
what ? i need her vote .
hanna , stop already !
you &apos;ve got homecoming queen locked down .
really ? you can rig the election ?
sorry , i have enough to do already , thanks .
i &apos;m head of the committee ,
half of which is out sick with the flu ,
so i &apos;ll be restocking the ice and refilling the hummus bowl ...
and trying to look cute
for my first official date .
with alex ?
wait , you &apos;re bringing him to homecoming ?
so , this is real !
look at her blush !
stop !
damn ! now i have to come .
seriously , you guys ,
he &apos;s not gonna know anybody there ,
so can you just do your best
to make him feel included ?
no , we were planning on freezing him out .
all right , moving on .
em , who are you gonna bring ?
i think i &apos;m gonna go stag .
i will , too .
why don &apos;t you guys come together ?
oh , you &apos;d make such a cute couple .
how did i just go from wearing mom jeans
to being samantha ronson ?
who cares who anyone goes to this thing with ?
i mean , it &apos;s just a dance .
you should bring someone who you have fun with .
i might want to go with someone .
i just don &apos;t want people thinking it means more than it does .
are you and ben back together ?
no . no , of course not .
so ... who &apos;s the mystery dude ?
i &apos;m starving .
what &apos;s wrong ? bad fortune ?
yeah , confucius says stop being such a drama queen .
&quot; lions and tigers and bitches , oh my !
&quot; there &apos;s no place like homecoming .
see you there . &apos; a. &apos; &quot;
到时候见 -a
so , my parents are going out of town this weekend ,
and i thought maybe you could stay the night .
i &apos;ve been doing a lot of thinking , and i &apos;m ready ...
to do it .
sean , i &apos;m not ready .
i made a commitment to myself ...
a commitment i want to honor .
good . nice work , you guys . sit down .
may i have two other volunteers , please ?
hanna .
you wanna give it a go ?
no .
see ? i can say no .
so can i. get up .
you can be the instigator .
lucas !
uh , no , i &apos;m really more comfortable
in an observational role during sexercise .
come on , you two . let &apos;s go .
so , you want to come up to my room ?
i can &apos;t do this .
but you make me so hot .
no , i mean , i can &apos;t do this with you .
girls like her don &apos;t approach guys like me
unless they have deep @-@ seated self @-@ esteem issues
and a serious drinking problem .
just play along , lucas .
this is embarrassing .
why ?
because i don &apos;t need to know how to rebuff the advances
of a genetic splice between barbie and shakira .
it &apos;s just never gonna happen .
the point of this is to be prepared
for the situation when it does arise--
mr. mazarra , let &apos;s look at the facts .
i have the upper @-@ body strength of screech ,
and i spend my weekends playing wii ... alone .
i think my virginity is pretty well safeguarded .
both of you , start again .
so , you wanna come up to my room ?
yes .
hey . can i talk to you ?
no , i can &apos;t . i have a staff meeting .
no , i just need--
i &apos;m late .
haven &apos;t seen you in a while .
yeah . things have been kind of busy .
me and the girls have been working
on the memorial for alison .
oh , right .
you going to homecoming ?
um ... i don &apos;t think so .
dance music isn &apos;t my thing .
i &apos;m not really gaga for gaga .
so ... maybe we should ...
try to catch up sometime ?
yeah . we should .
i have to go to class .
way to sneak up on people .
sorry . look , can you get it today ?
get what ?
jenna &apos;s file .
no . they canceled my shift at work .
well , go in anyway .
it &apos;s a therapist &apos;s office .
pretend you &apos;re having a nervous breakdown .
well , if i lose the crown to heather perez ,
i won &apos;t have to pretend .
hanna , i &apos;m serious .
that file might be our only chance
to find out what jenna knows about that night ,
and if she and her creepy stepbrother are planning revenge--
spence , i &apos;ll get it . why the panic attack ?
is it because of the fortune cookie ?
it &apos;s because toby cavanaugh ,
who &apos;s never had a date in his life ,
just bought two tickets to homecoming .
so , jenna &apos;s coming , too .
well , they did promise to see us there , right ?
hey , hanna . spencer .
so , is it true you &apos;re taking the country club &apos;s towel boy
to homecoming ?
his name is alex , and yes , i am .
knock it off , mona .
what ?
i think it &apos;s cute she &apos;s taking
her cinderfella to the ball .
can you go get me a fro @-@ yo with sprinkles ?
wow , that was exactly the reaction i want to avoid .
don &apos;t pay any attention to her .
she &apos;s just insecure .
yeah , like a pit bull .
why are you friends with her ?
once you get to know her , she &apos;s really funny ...
and she &apos;s always there for me ,
even if it &apos;s just to watch me try on shoes .
look , she &apos;s a good person .
she just talks tough
so people will forget what a geek she used to be .
ow ! okay , you need to chillax ,
or i need to start carrying a tranq gun .
what is that ?
终获自由
i was about to look for you .
you were ? how come ?
well , i wanted to talk to you about something .
do you want to hang out tomorrow ?
um , i would , but i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m going with my friends to homecoming .
that &apos;s too bad . i ...
i was hoping maybe you &apos;d go with me .
to homecoming ?
i didn &apos;t think that was your scene .
i have a scene ?
i didn &apos;t think listening to the smiths
alone in my room was a scene .
you know what i mean .
i think what you mean is that you don &apos;t want to go with me .
no , it &apos;s not that .
it &apos;s just ...
i would &apos;ve thought you think homecoming is lame .
it is pretty lame , but ...
you &apos;re not .
okay .
so ... i &apos;ll pick you up at 9 : 00 .
sure ... but it starts at 8 : 00 .
lame .
hey , need any help ?
you &apos;re a little early .
the dance doesn &apos;t start for 27 hours .
but i wanted to do a dry run ,
test out the route ,
time myself door @-@ to @-@ door .
you sound like me .
yeah , but ... i was joking .
i &apos;m about to buy a suit ,
and i wanted to know what color your dress is
so we can match .
oh ! don &apos;t bother .
look , i &apos;ll match my outfit to yours .
just wear whatever you have .
okay , we can &apos;t both show up in jeans and a t @-@ shirt .
you &apos;re sure that you want to ?
yes , i want to .
it &apos;s a good excuse to buy a suit ,
and , uh ... here .
what &apos;s that for ?
the tickets .
no , don &apos;t worry about it .
this is my treat .
i just ... i know how hard you work .
i don &apos;t want you to spend your money on some stupid dance .
well , tough luck ...
&apos;cause i want to .
i &apos;m wearing a silver strapless dress .
can &apos;t wait to see you in it .
see you tomorrow .
see you tomorrow .
thank you so much , guys .
hi !
hey .
i didn &apos;t know you were in a band .
jazz band . i don &apos;t march .
and , yes , i &apos;m voting for you .
thank you . um ...
okay , well , i &apos;ll see you at homecoming .
i don &apos;t think so .
too bad . i know emily really wanted you to come .
i &apos;ll think about it .
sorry i &apos;m late .
were you talking to her ?
who ?
emily .
why are you doing this ?
what are you talking about ?
you know you &apos;re only fooling yourself , right ?
i mean , once she finds out the truth about you , she &apos;ll hate you .
who &apos;s gonna tell her ?
doctor &apos;s office
yes
careful with that ! are you blind ?
can we help you ?
what are you guys doing ?
baking a cake !
well , are you gonna be done soon ?
no !
how long did you wait ?
i finally left when chewy &apos;s five- &apos; o @-@ clock shadow turned into a beard .
did you tell spencer ?
relax . i rigged the door so we
can get back inside later this weekend .
hey , do you have anything a little less hippie
and a little more bougie ?
whatever &apos;s in there is what i have .
okay , so , what do you think ?
&quot; it &apos;s an honor just to be nominated , &quot;
or &quot; it &apos;s about time . where &apos;s my throne ? &quot;
they both look good .
aria , i know what you &apos;re going through .
when my parents were fighting ,
i barely left my room .
i wore my headphones
and blasted jay @-@ z to drown them out .
it got to the point where i &apos;d only take them off to shower .
like , the worst part is now , waiting ,
which is why you need to get out of the house .
we will have an amazing time tonight ,
and i know someone who has a huge crush on you .
who ?
chris buzzini .
i thought he was bringing lisa .
he is , but he told sean he &apos;d rather take you .
he just thinks you &apos;re not into him .
well , i &apos;m--i &apos;m not .
so who are you into ?
oh , my gosh , i knew it !
you &apos;re already seeing someone .
no !
yes , you met someone when you were living in iceland .
what &apos;s his name ?
forget it . i probably can &apos;t pronounce it , anyways .
look , aria , this guy may be cute and all ,
but that booty call is a long distance .
it &apos;s time to say good @-@ bye
to your viking and move on .
you &apos;re in two completely different places right now .
maybe you &apos;re right .
of course i am !
so , what are you gonna wear ,
&quot; the bell jar , &quot;
or &quot; let &apos;s get this party started &quot; ?
hi ! there she is .
i was worried you were gonna bail .
no ! no , i &apos;m ready to have a fantastic time tonight .
with no date ? my , how the mighty have fallen .
whatever . she can share my date .
yeah . i have no problem with that .
and mine .
yeah .
hey , i &apos;m aria .
alex . nice to meet you .
you too .
unfortunately , you have to work before you can play ,
&apos;cause you &apos;ve got the first shift at the beanbag toss !
you &apos;re a hero .
um , will you excuse me for just one sec ?
yeah , sure .
talk to him .
yeah .
it &apos;s good to see you , too .
what are you doing here ?
nice to see you , too , sis .
no , seriously , what are you doing here ?
i was asked .
the alumni has a former homecoming queen present the crown .
right , and this year it &apos;s some chick from the class of 2000 .
i &apos;m filling in .
apparently she &apos;s been vomiting since thursday .
great .
oh , by the way ...
they posted the winning golden orchid essays online ,
and i had a chance to read yours ...
or , should i say , mine ?
look , i &apos;ve already told mom and dad ,
and they think a retraction
would be more of an embarrassment for us .
it was a really stupid thing to do ,
and i &apos;m so sorry ...
no , you &apos;re not .
you never are .
oh my gosh , melissa .
hey , trish .
that &apos;s awful ! is that becky newman ?
it looks like her hair got in a fight
with her face and they both lost .
yearbook pictures ! hey .
hey . nice bowtie .
oh , thanks . it &apos;s my grandpa &apos;s .
hey . i &apos;m lucas .
great . can you be lucas over there ?
i &apos;ll see you around , hanna .
yeah , see you around . have fun .
rude much ?
am i in a parallel universe ,
or did you just engage in conversation with hermie-
isn &apos;t that what alison called him ?
he is not a hermaphrodite , okay ?
he &apos;s a nice guy .
saying hi to him &apos;s not a crime .
it should be .
you didn &apos;t bust your ass to become rosewood &apos;s &quot; it girl &quot;
just to make chit @-@ chat with shim .
if you and i start slipping up ,
we &apos;re gonna be right back at the bottom again .
yeah , well , i &apos;m starting to think i &apos;ve lost a few things
on the climb up .
look , you can go kamikaze if you want ,
but i will cut your rip cord
before i let you drag me down with you .
hello ?
hey .
hi , i &apos;m melissa , spencer &apos;s sister .
alex . nice to meet you .
we &apos;ve met . at the club .
are you on the homecoming committee , as well ?
alex doesn &apos;t go here .
he goes to school across town .
where do you go ?
p.s. 187 on elmhurst .
you wouldn &apos;t have heard of it , melissa .
it &apos;s not in the same zip code as the prada outlet .
um , catering crisis .
bye
bye .
i didn &apos;t plan this .
i already said i believe you .
yeah , but you don &apos;t .
i do . can you hand me those , please ?
hey , nice haircut .
thanks .
great .
well done .
i didn &apos;t tell anyone about us .
let &apos;s just drop this , okay ?
i &apos;m just grateful it ended before
one of us got seriously hurt .
too late for that .
it wasn &apos;t a friend who sent that text .
hi .
oh , well , that &apos;s all right .
you just missed it , but there you go .
have a good one , rest of your night .
so ... who &apos;s &quot; a &quot; ?
it &apos;s someone who &apos;s messing with me .
aria , why would someone want to mess with you ?
because last summer ...
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s complicated .
if you &apos;ve had enough , i &apos;d be happy to relieve you .
oh , thanks , ms. welch . i &apos;m fine .
i was talking to her .
oh , i &apos;ve had enough .
so , who &apos;s up ?
you know , they &apos;re showing a fritz lang double feature
at rosewood cinema tonight .
if we leave now , we &apos;ll only miss the credits .
i ... might be a little overdressed .
this may sound stupid ,
but i &apos;ve never been to one of these things before .
what are you so nervous about ?
meeting up with my friends ?
who think i &apos;m a freak .
not all them .
i mean , they &apos;ll get over it
because they want me to be happy .
it &apos;s just a party .
you know , if we get hungry , we eat some chips ,
have some punch ...
punch , really ?
are we gonna jitterbug , too ?
you don &apos;t have to dance .
good , &apos; cause i--i don &apos;t .
okay , so how about you stand there and do this ...
and i &apos;ll dance around you .
i think i &apos;d rather drink the punch .
okay .
hey , that was a quick shift .
you okay ?
no , my claustrophobia kicked in .
can you find someone to take my place ?
yeah . alone in a dark booth with fitz ?
it &apos;s , like , every freshman girl &apos;s dream .
hey , hanna .
hi !
hey .
um , have you guys seen emily around ?
no , i was just about to text her .
don &apos;t bother .
hey , guys .
i &apos;ll go get us some drinks .
you &apos;re here with toby ?
either you &apos;ve got some genius plan of sleeping with the enemy ,
or you &apos;ve lost your mind !
you don &apos;t even know him .
what is there to know ?
who else could &apos;ve helped jenna ?
he has every reason to hate us .
he doesn &apos;t .
emily , if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck ,
it &apos;s a freaking duck .
wow . i thought at least you &apos;d understand .
emily , wait .
why are you doing this ?
aren &apos;t you the one who told me to follow my feelings
and not to let other people &apos;s opinions stop me ?
yes , yes , i did , but that
was when i thought you were taking maya .
maya ? ! why would i take maya ?
hey .
you wanna go play some games ?
sure .
so , did you buy a raffle ticket yet ?
not yet .
where &apos;s spencer ?
did she leave you all alone ?
it &apos;s cool . i like people @-@ watching .
i &apos;m glad to hear that .
i mean , most guys would be uncomfortable
being ... used like this , but if you &apos;re not ,
then no one &apos;s getting hurt .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about spencer ,
you know , dating you to piss off our dad .
she &apos;s always trying something new to make him crazy .
you really should buy a ticket .
that is a beautiful car .
did i miss something ?
when did she start hanging out with toby ?
i have no idea . i &apos;ve never even seen her talk to him .
there you are .
you keep disappearing on us .
yeah , we ... had to ... get ice .
hey , wanna dance ?
let &apos;s do it .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . i &apos;ll be right back .
aria ? i &apos;m sorry . can you come here ?
please , hanna . i &apos;m sorry .
i figured out what toby &apos;s tattoo means .
what ?
&quot; 901 free at last ? &quot;
it &apos;s september 1st .
that &apos;s the day ali disappeared .
hanna , you &apos;ve gotta get that file .
tonight ?
emily &apos;s not going to believe us without proof .
she could be walking into a trap .
could we do it after they announce the homecoming queen ? please .
okay , fine . fine . i &apos;ll get it .
keep an eye on emily until i get the file .
wait , what about me ?
keep an eye on sean .
what ?
i can &apos;t exactly tell him where i &apos;m going .
if i make something up , he &apos;ll want to come with me .
just keep him busy .
how am i supposed to do that ?
i don &apos;t know . just figure it out .
come on .
spencer , wanna go to the fortune teller ?
spencer .
what ?
i asked if you wanted to go to the fortune teller .
um , no , i don &apos;t really think so .
it &apos;s not really my kind of thing .
you know , on second thought , it might be kind of fun .
sean , hey .
hey . where &apos;s hanna ?
oh , she &apos;s with spencer , getting some more ice .
more ? is there a heat wave going on in here
i don &apos;t know about ?
oh , right !
right , she actually said that there was ...
uh , a crisis with the band or ...
do you want some food ?
hi , could i get a cab to rosewood high school , please ?
great . thanks .
hey .
the homecoming queen is leaving ?
nominee , and yeah , sort of .
isn &apos;t that kind of like
han solo abandoning the millennium falcon ?
uh , honestly , i have no idea .
why are you leaving ?
got enough photos for the yearbook .
you came just to take photos ?
yeah . and to cast my vote for you .
listen , um , i left a check for the band
at the office where i work .
would you mind driving me there and back ?
it &apos;s either that or watch
the new hoarders episode with my parents , so yeah .
here , uh , you look cold .
thank you .
let &apos;s go .
there &apos;s a lot of anxiety in these cards .
are you a worrier ?
spencer ?
hmm ?
question .
yeah , i guess so .
this indicates a journey .
it &apos;s unclear whether it &apos;s a journey
from the past or in the future ,
but i &apos;m seeing an image .
you could be taking care of someone .
they could be ... hurt .
what else do they say ?
you know , this is typical hanna .
she makes a big deal about coming
to this thing together , and then she ditches me .
let &apos;s dance . come on .
come on , i love this song .
you &apos;re not gonna leave me to bump and grind by myself , are you ?
i &apos;ll be back in a sec , okay ?
what did you tell hanna about us ?
what are you talking about ?
why did she think you &apos;d be my date ?
i don &apos;t know . she came up to me .
shouldn &apos;t you be with your date ?
don &apos;t make a big deal out of this .
i &apos;m not , you are , and i don &apos;t know why ,
since you &apos;ve clearly moved on , anyway .
i told you i needed space .
yeah , and i &apos;m giving you space ...
to come to grips with who you are ,
not to hide it .
i &apos;m not hiding anything .
then look me in the eye
and tell me you have no feelings for me ...
and i &apos;ll leave you alone for good .
when the genii card is reversed ,
it indicates something from which you are running away .
the lovers is a joyful card ,
but paired with judgment ,
it means there &apos;s something wrong with this couple .
it &apos;s a bad match .
here , there &apos;s darkness in him ,
maybe even violence or vengeance .
where did this come from ?
ezra , wait !
just let me talk for a second , please .
i don &apos;t want to argue or try to convince you--
i know it &apos;s over , i know that !
but-- i just , i can &apos;t stand the idea
of you walking around and hating me .
hate you ?
the only person i hate right now
is myself for asking too much of you .
seeing you out there tonight ,
out on the dance floor ,
having fun with guys your own age ,
not sneaking around and
holing up with me in my apartment to watch videos
and eat one of the three things i can actually cook ?
because ...
because i can &apos;t take you to the movies .
i can &apos;t take you out to a nice restaurant ,
and for the record ...
i could never hate you .
i figured you &apos;d be here tonight .
the new haircut wasn &apos;t to impress mrs. welch .
i gotta go .
hanna , did anybody lock the elavator again ?
can you wait here ? i &apos;ll only be a couple of minutes , okay ?
oh , yeah , take your time .
hoarders always has , you know , two cases .
you okay ?
you wanna talk about it ?
why don &apos;t we go upstairs to the chem lab ?
it &apos;s quiet up there .
what &apos;s going on ?
you seem distracted .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry . i promise , this is the last time .
the phone &apos;s not the problem .
maybe my work for the night &apos;s done .
what do you mean ?
just go ahead . answer it .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll just be a minute .
sorry .
what is it ?
hey , i &apos;m looking through the entire &quot; m &quot; section ,
and there &apos;s no jenna marshall .
well , check under cavanaugh .
she &apos;s toby &apos;s stepsister .
maybe his dad adopted her .
hey , my phone &apos;s dying. what did you say ?
i said check under cavanaugh !
but what if the ...
hanna !
where &apos;s alex ?
he left .
what do you mean ?
he left .
do you need me to tweet it to you ?
what did you say to him ?
i didn &apos;t have to say much .
you screwed up this one all by yourself .
it &apos;s so weird to be here at night .
wanna talk about what happened ?
i just got upset .
did it have to do with maya ?
no .
yes .
emily ...
did you come with the wrong person to homecoming ?
maybe .
i understand .
why do you like me ?
what ?
why are you so nice to me when ...
when you know what me and my friends did ?
i guess it &apos;s because i &apos;ve also done things that i &apos;m not proud of .
we &apos;ve all got secrets , emily .
and don &apos;t forget to buy your raffle tickets
for a chance to win a brand @-@ new toyota corolla .
that is one sweet ride .
and now , for the reason we &apos;re all here .
i can still remember the feeling of joy i had when ,
as a rosewood student , i heard my name called .
please welcome your new homecoming king and queen ,
sean ackard and hanna marin !
sean ackard and hanna marin !
is that jenna &apos;s file ?
no , i got toby &apos;s .
turns out jenna wasn &apos;t the patient .
the therapist had her come in for one session
to see how she felt about toby coming back home .
oh , my god . well , what else does it say ?
well , the dates prove he
wasn &apos;t away at school when ali disappeared .
he was still here in rosewood .
what else ?
see for yourself .
session 12 , august 15th .
think i didn &apos;t see what was going on in there ?
it &apos;s not what it looked like .
