emily , this call for you form a sean mcallister .
came to my phone accidentally . it sounded very important .
sean .
i was gonna call you back.i just--i got busy on a case .
ian doyle vanished from prison .
interpol can &apos;t find him .
what are you saying ?
he &apos;s off the grid , emily .
prentiss , what &apos;s going on with you ?
i &apos;ve been watching you the last couple of days
and something is obviously bothering you .
derek , because i like you ,
i &apos;m going to ask you not to do this .
i want to talk to sean .
they got her .
drop the phone . get on the ground , now .
am i in danger ?
we all are .
tsia , it &apos;s emily . where are you ?
bois du boulogne .
well , that &apos;s a significant change of address .
that &apos;s not the only change .
i got engaged .
wow . so you and jeremy are gonna ...
that &apos;s great . that &apos;s great .
emily , what &apos;s wrong ?
have you heard from sean ?
yes , he &apos;s been calling me for days .
but you haven &apos;t talked to him ?
i don &apos;t work for him anymore . i &apos;m out .
so &apos;s doyle .
sean thinks we &apos;re all in danger .
but i was the only one who had any personal connection to him .
as far as doyle is concerned ,
lauren reynolds died in a car accident .
jeremy and i made sure of that .
ok ?
i want to hear you say it .
go on .
lauren reynolds is dead .
sweetie , trust me .
you died and we &apos;re all good .
ok . just be careful .
and give jeremy my love . bye .
who &apos;s lauren reynolds ?
she was a friend of mine .
how did she die ?
a car accident .
i &apos;m really sorry .
good morning .
let &apos;s get started .
hey . thank you all for coming .
and time is of the essence .
ok . molly grandin , 25 years old ,
she &apos;s been missing approximately 24 hours .
her car was found abandoned in a strip mall parking lot .
syracuse police chief just called me to tell me
that 4 months ago another woman , gail langston ,
also 25 , went missing .
gail &apos;s body washed up 3 days later in onondaga lake .
she &apos;d been held captive , her hands and feet smashed ,
and then she was stabbed to death .
her car was found in the same parking lot as molly grandin &apos;s .
other than abandoned cars ,
what makes them think it &apos;s the same offender ?
both women packed a bag with enough clothes and toiletries
to last them for the weekend ,
and in both cases , the bags were found
in the car along with their purses and cell phones .
if the unsub is sticking to the same m.o. ,
then molly only has 36 hours left .
let &apos;s go .
the plane awaits .
please !
please , somebody help me !
somebody help me ! somebody help me ! please !
oh , my god .
please , somebody help me !
&quot; it &apos;s hard to find an enemy who has outposts in your head . &quot;
sally kempton .
all right , baby girl . keep looking .
garcia still hasn &apos;t found any overlap
between molly grandin and gail langston &apos;s lives .
for two girls that didn &apos;t know each other
they had a lot in common .
what &apos;s the first thing that jumps out at you ?
their body types are both small ,
but it &apos;s not just physical .
they both shy away from the camera
and clearly don &apos;t enjoy being photographed .
both easily overpowered and controlled .
well , at 25 they &apos;d be much older than most undergrads at s.u.
you know , their college transcripts
are littered with incompletes and missed semesters .
both from blue @-@ collar backgrounds
with no scholarship .
must be hard to keep up while working a full @-@ time job .
so going to a private school could have been worth it
for appearances &apos; sake .
if the unsub met them on campus , he could be another student .
he may not be a student . he might be an employee .
janitorial staff , security .
uses a similar background to bond with the victims ?
they both packed bags
to go away with him for the weekend .
that trip &apos;s romantic .
yeah , he &apos;s not just getting to know them , he &apos;s dating them .
prentiss , go to molly &apos;s apartment .
if she knew the abductor ,
there might be evidence there .
reid and morgan , go to the dump site .
but gail &apos;s body was found almost 4 months ago .
won &apos;t all the evidence be gone by now ?
you can actually find out a lot about an unsub
by where they choose to leave their victims .
yeah , garcia , what do you got ?
syracuse police chief barrows brought a suspect in
for questioning 5 minutes ago . his name is lyle donaldson .
molly &apos;s ex @-@ boyfriend .
donaldson &apos;s got a boat . fishes twice a month
in the same area where gail langston was found .
he was also a student in a class with her at s.u.
and he &apos;s got an anger problem .
3 arrests for assault .
yeah . 2 of them were for beating up molly grandin .
it &apos;s gotta be him , right ?
it &apos;s unusual for serial killers to go after someone
so easily linked to them , but we &apos;ll see if he fits the profile .
i didn &apos;t know gail langston .
yeah , we had a class together ,
but there were like 100 people in it .
i barely went , anyway .
i knew gail was murdered , but ...
that looks like torture .
my client is sitting here with you , agent rossi .
how could he be off torturing his ex @-@ girlfriend
at the same time ?
lyle , do you know anyone with a cabin ?
a fishing buddy ?
someplace private to keep molly tied up
until you get back ?
no . man , this is insane .
i would never hurt--
ok , look , i did some things that i &apos;m not proud of , but--
that &apos;s enough .
but i could never do this .
the last time you beat her up ,
did she dump you ?
he was arrested but never formally charged with assault .
ok , fine . after you broke molly &apos;s jaw ,
did she still want to date you ?
look , we always managed to work things out .
but not this time .
she was lying . she was seeing somebody else .
who ?
i don &apos;t know . but it was obvious .
molly , she changed .
she changed the way that she dressed ,
and she was going out to clubs .
when you two were together ,
did you control what she wore , where she went ?
this guy &apos;s into controlling her , too .
you know , a body would be found here rather quickly ,
especially if it wasn &apos;t weighed down .
there was no postmortem damage
from being tied to the weights .
everything else about gail &apos;s capture
was carefully planned .
it seems unlikely this guy would just suddenly panic
and lose control .
this guy prioritizes control .
i mean , gail &apos;s body was beaten in a very specific way--
a mallet to the hands and feet .
look at this .
the stab wounds are parallel to each other .
they look more like puncture wounds .
the m.e. thinks it &apos;s a phillips head screwdriver .
which means he uses tools instead of traditional weapons .
the wounds definitely have a purpose .
did you visit molly in the emergency room
about 5 months ago ?
of course i did .
and bought her a car after that .
why ?
she could have died in that accident .
riding a bike around in this city with the weather ?
too dangerous .
molly told you she was in a bike accident ?
yeah .
yes .
you knew she was in an abusive relationship .
what she said , it wasn &apos;t like that .
was she always attracted to men who hit her ?
molly is not like that .
my daughter &apos;s got all as in school .
she &apos;s holding down a full @-@ time job .
she &apos;s gonna get a degree at s.u.
i never hit my daughter .
not once .
thank you .
&quot; today i do , tomorrow i will &quot; ?
maybe this guy thought he was sinking the body
by filling it with water .
well , i mean , at first he &apos;d be right ,
but after a few hours , the decaying tissue would create gas
and the body would become buoyant .
so this guy wanted to watch her die ,
then sink beneath the surface .
that sounds like classic water burial , right ?
well , everything points that way , except for one thing .
most water burials are exclusively done by females .
until now , victimology , m.o. ,
and physical abuse
indicated a male offender .
until now .
prentiss .
morgan and i think we might be looking for a female offender .
that explains why there was no sign of sexual assault .
with an unsub this obsessed with control and power ,
it &apos;s usually part of the territory .
it looks like there was a female living in the other bedroom
in molly &apos;s apartment .
we &apos;d have been told if she had a roommate .
yeah , so molly must have wanted to keep it a secret for a reason .
whoever she was ,
she left recently and in a hurry .
i &apos;ll put a canvass out now . thanks , reid .
so , neighbors did see a woman coming and going
from molly &apos;s apartment over the last few months ,
but nobody saw her close enough
to get a sketch .
and no one met her ?
no . the best description we got
was white femail , mid @-@ 20s ,
light @-@ brown hari , plain .
molly never mentioned a roommate to her father or her coworkers .
lyle didn &apos;t know , either .
is he still here ?
we couldn &apos;t charge him , so his lawyer walked him out .
all right , so we need to start over , go back over
both gail and molly &apos;s cases and look at everything
from the perspective of a female unsub .
i &apos;ll bring in gail &apos;s family
and ask about the women in her life .
prentiss , you and seaver go back over to molly &apos;s apartment .
find out what else she &apos;s hiding .
if you could just call my father
and make it where he thinks something happened to me .
really ? think that through .
who would i say i was ?
i &apos;m not sure . i don &apos;t know .
well , you &apos;ve done this before . i haven &apos;t .
jane ?
don &apos;t leave me here , ok ?
come on , molly .
you gotta relax , molls .
trust me , no one looks good when they &apos;re freakin &apos; out .
i &apos;m still shaken up . i &apos;m sorry .
move on .
you &apos;re grating when you &apos;re anxious .
i woke up terrified .
i thought i &apos;d been kidnapped by some psycho .
what was i supposed to do ?
every day babies enter the world .
and it &apos;s cold and bright and they &apos;re naked .
what do they do ?
cry ?
no . they trust .
they cling to their mother &apos;s breast
and accept love .
right ?
right , yeah .
that &apos;s true .
are you saying
you &apos;re my mother in this exercise ?
uh , no .
we are gonna watch movies , have girls night , that &apos;s all .
just you , me , and julia roberts .
i &apos;m done with this .
just untie me .
i ...
you spit at me .
i &apos;m feeding you by hand
and you spit at me .
no .
i can &apos;t allow you to keep crossing these boundaries .
i &apos;m gonna help you fix yourself .
you &apos;ve become an ungrateful narcissist .
i call this a humility check .
it shatters those selfish thoughts
so you can hear other people &apos;s feelings and needs .
please , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , please .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sor--
today i do , tomorrow i will .
today i do ,
tomorrow i will .
she was overdosing on daily affirmations .
yeah , saying you &apos;re happy isn &apos;t the same as being happy .
i think i found her dark secret .
and this ... is a diet journal .
check with garcia .
see if her spending reflects a disorder .
hey . seaver . how much money
did molly spend on food every week ?
30 bucks a week at the grocery store .
thai food every friday .
yikes , she is worse than me . $ 8.00 a day for coffee .
can you go back a couple months ?
yeah .
oh , my .
back then the spending tells an entirely different story
of the unhealthy sort .
lots of drugstore purchases .
fast food places .
only a few dollars a week at the grocery .
carrots and hot sauce .
and then 17 bucks at mcdonald &apos;s .
binge night .
anything in the journal ?
it &apos;s intense . she recorded not only what she put into her body
but what came out . calories expended during exercise ,
and she weighed her bowel movements .
anorexia / bulimia .
the last entry is 10 weeks before she disappeared .
when did her spending change ?
about 3 months ago .
she got a membership at a yoga studio
and stated paying for cooking classes .
thanks .
we need to find out if gail langston
had a similar pattern before she was killed .
rossi &apos;s speaking with her family right now .
did gail have many friends ?
oh , gail never had a lot of girlfriends . she ...
believe me , if she &apos;d met one ,
it would have been big news .
was she staying with anyone ?
photos of her apartment show a roll @-@ out sofa
made up as a bed .
in that little place ?
no , absolutely not .
if family came to town , they stayed at the house .
were you close with your sister ?
we used to tell each other everything .
thick as thieves , those two .
she was different in the last few months
before she was murdered .
she got real secretive .
peter , that makes it sound so bad .
how else had she changed ?
she was a lot better .
she was happier , more confident .
she went back to school , finally .
and she was working really hard .
why did she take time off from school ?
she wanted to--
she had depression .
really bad .
she was moody , that &apos;s all .
was she ever treated for depression ?
once i found her in the bathtub .
that was an accident .
i took her to the e.r. and they admitted her to some program .
after that she was ok .
you know , up and down , but the doctor said that was normal .
was she seeing a therapist or attending a support group ?
she only spoke in terms of expelling negative thoughts
or visualizing her truth .
she was a lot better .
but she wasn &apos;t herself .
what about the phrase ,
&quot; today i do ,
tomorrow i will &quot; ?
that &apos;s the one that she used the most .
and it was working .
you know , this phrase doesn &apos;t
seem to have a particular source or author .
it &apos;s found in pretty much every self @-@ help book--
i read 22 of them today--
all touting the same basic 3 @-@ part plan .
let me guess-- phase one is positive thinking ,
visualizing goals .
that &apos;s to work up the courage to get to phase 2--
taking real steps to achieve said goal .
gail committed to school ,
got grades like never before .
molly gave up her obsessive food journal
and started eating better .
it &apos;s hard to believe motivational sayings alone
would allow her to make these type of strides .
maybe that &apos;s why the unsub moved in with them .
she could offer support and encouragement day and night .
she &apos;d be around to watch molly &apos;s diet
or gail &apos;s study habits .
at first her methods worked .
she gets to be the hero , the savior .
she &apos;s a pure narcissist , so helping her victims
is only about gaining their appreciation and dependence .
the more her victims gain confidence ,
the less they need a full @-@ time cheerleader .
and that &apos;s when her motivational plan goes completely off the rails .
phase 3 is normally about
maintaining the tenets of the program independently .
but her program doesn &apos;t end . she holds them captive ,
destroys them physically .
she &apos;s the motivational speaker from hell .
what were you doing on the floor ?
were you trying to walk all by yourself ?
you were gone a long time .
i had to get supplies for you .
you don &apos;t want to get infected from old bandages , do you ?
maybe i should go to a hospital .
nonsense .
you are not a burden .
i can &apos;t walk or go to the bathroom by myself .
that &apos;s why i got you these .
voila .
you want me to wear diapers ?
it &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of .
just till you get back on your feet .
i need a doctor , a real one .
i might have some painkillers somewhere .
i don &apos;t use them because i prefer to build character .
jane , i need help .
please let me out of here .
i don &apos;t want to die in this room .
hey , now .
what is all this negativity ?
you are gonna be fine .
taking care of people is what i do best .
it &apos;s my life &apos;s calling .
i just want to go home .
you &apos;re adorable .
you said yourself , you can &apos;t even walk or go to the bathroom .
the first step is always admitting we need help .
next , we visualize .
imagine you &apos;re walking across this room .
i see it now .
you are doing great .
halfway there .
now say it with me .
today i do , tomorrow i will .
today i do ,
tomorrow i will .
again .
but this time just believe it even more .
today i do ,
tomorrow i will .
great .
we &apos;re looking for a white woman in her mid @-@ 20s ,
most likely blue collar and local to the syracuse area .
she probably has a job that puts her in the role of caretaker ,
such as a masseuse , a nail or hair stylist , personal trainer .
women feel comfortable opening up to her about their personal lives ,
revealing details about their insecurities
that she later uses to manipulate them .
do you think she tries to pass herself off as a therapist
or a counselor of some sort ?
that &apos;s doubtful .
her narcsistic personality wouldn &apos;t allow her
to listen to anything that didn &apos;t revolve around her
for more than a few minutes at a time .
it &apos;s hard to learn anything
when you always need to be the expert .
we don &apos;t think she &apos;s capable of getting a degree of any kind .
wouldn &apos;t she need some kind of
certification for the jobs you &apos;re talking about ?
she would , but she &apos;s a master manipulator .
she probably talked her way into many jobs
before they realized her credentials were fake .
so check gyms and spas , salons , yoga studios
for employees fired in the last 2 years .
we need to i.d. this woman as fast as possible
if we want any chance of finding molly grandin alive .
why didn &apos;t you tell us molly battled with severe anorexia ?
i didn &apos;t know .
all right , look , it &apos;s not as bad as you &apos;re making it out to be here .
she was always a chubby kid , right ?
she always had to watch what she ate .
did she get treatment ?
we don &apos;t believe in stuff like that .
we &apos;re hard @-@ workers . we like to solve our own problems .
it &apos;s urgent that you tell me everything that you know .
mr. grandin , i &apos;m having difficulty understanding
why keeping molly &apos;s secrets
is more important than finding her alive .
it &apos;s not . she just wouldn &apos;t
want anyone knowing her personal problems .
your daughter is specifically vulnerable to this suspect
because of her private emotional issues .
now , we need to know as much about molly
as does the person who &apos;s holding her captive .
so i &apos;m going to ask you again ,
are there any other secrets you &apos;re not sharing with me ?
she collapsed about a year ago .
malnutrition . anemia .
she wasn &apos;t eating .
did she get treatment ?
30 days .
uh , finley center for eating disorders .
at syracuse general .
yeah .
why ?
gail langston was treated there for depression .
i should have told you .
yeah .
fantastic . i &apos;m so impressed .
now you &apos;ll appreciate every step you take ,
because you earned it .
so , where are you on your positivity spectrum ?
a 4 .
no , i mean a 9 .
i don &apos;t buy it .
your mind is somewhere else .
no , i &apos;m right here with you .
you &apos;re thinking about lyle again , aren &apos;t you ?
no , i &apos;m done with him .
not even gonna be friends .
really ?
i &apos;m so proud of you .
don &apos;t be . he &apos;s the one who ended it .
i bet that makes you want him now more than ever .
how many times did you promise me you wouldn &apos;t see him ,
then you did , sneaking around and lying ?
let &apos;s not fight about lyle . why don &apos;t we watch a movie ?
how many times does he have to put you in the hospital
before you realize he &apos;ll never change ?
he doesn &apos;t care about your feelings .
i know .
no , you don &apos;t ! i am trying to save you from yourself .
now , conversation clearly does not help you .
i am done talking .
garcia , both families released their daughters &apos; medical records .
have you gotten access to those yet ?
yes . both women went to the same hospital
but for different programs and at different times .
maybe the unsub works at the hospital ?
even if she conned her way into a job ,
i doubt she &apos;d last long enough to get close to patient files .
we were off on our profile .
she doesn &apos;t find her victims by chance like we thought .
she hunts them .
garcia , does syracuse general
keep their surveillance footage of the entrances and exits ?
oh , in this age of black market pharmaceutical drug trade ,
you betcha . i can get you that .
excuse me .
tsia ?
he &apos;s gone .
who ? what &apos;s going on ?
jeremy &apos;s dead .
what ?
i got home from work and he was just lying there .
he &apos;d been in the shower .
i don &apos;t know . i couldn &apos;t see anything .
they think it was a clot .
he &apos;s not even 40 . how could--
he didn &apos;t have a pulse , so i called the ambulance .
they tried to revive him , but ...
did somebody break in ?
uh--i don &apos;t think so .
look--look , he was out for his run .
he &apos;s training for a marathon .
was it his usual path ?
yes .
but he came back early .
he ... he called me , said he wasn &apos;t feeling well .
did he fall down on the path ?
did anyone run into him ?
oh , god .
how long have we been talking ?
you &apos;ve got to get out of there .
get a flight . leave france , get back to america .
cash transactions only from here on out .
am i clear ?
it &apos;s him , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s doyle .
toss that cell phone and get home safely .
oh , thanks , hon.
i can &apos;t believe you got my favorite beer .
now , molly and gail had different doctors ,
but both went to syracuse general pharmacy .
assuming they were stalked , you know , 10 to 14 weeks
before their disappearance , i went ahead and started
with footage from when they went to get refills ,
which falls right into that time window .
behold--gail langston , july 3rd .
see that woman a few steps behind her
with the large cup of coffee ?
check this out .
a few weeks later , there she is again .
the same woman is following her .
creepy .
she &apos;s wearing the same scarf as gail .
turn that up .
garcia , did this woman follow a similar pattern
when she was stalking molly ?
emily , you &apos;re totally ruining the ending .
here &apos;s molly and the stalker on november 8th .
what do you know ? she went shopping .
they &apos;re carrying identical purses .
and then 15 minutes later on their way out .
so she stalks them , copies them ,
and uses it to strike up a conversation .
oh , my god .
this is the best damn bootleg that rush ever did .
here is a nice clean one of our stalker lady person .
ok , now , can you blow that up and print it ?
yeah . i &apos;m doing it as we speak .
how did you know this was my favorite ?
i didn &apos;t .
i guess we just have a lot in common .
gail langston &apos;s family says they &apos;ve never seen her before .
molly &apos;s father said the same thing .
i sent the picture to lyle &apos;s lawyer ,
but he says he can &apos;t find him .
roommates haven &apos;t seen him since he left here yesterday .
where &apos;s his car ?
also missing .
put out an apb for lyle donaldson and the vehicle .
oh , man . the whole room is spinning .
it does that .
come on , baby , i gotta take a leak .
i bet . you drank like a fiend .
what &apos;s wrong , now ?
nothing .
everything &apos;s perfect .
you did exactly what i figured you &apos;d do .
i told molly the truth about you a million times ,
but she couldn &apos;t get it through her thick skull .
she &apos;s a visual learner , i guess .
wait .
how do you know molly ?
god , you &apos;re stupid .
hey--hey , you know where molly is right now ?
of course i do .
i actually care about her .
you are a cancer .
but luckily , i found a cure .
hey !
hey !
barrows found lyle &apos;s car in the same parking lot
where molly and gail &apos;s cars were found .
she &apos;s got him , too .
she &apos;s too obsessed with power and control to work with anyone ,
especially somebody like lyle .
he &apos;s dominating and violent , just like her .
if anything , she sees him as a threat .
but why take him now , with all this heat ?
she &apos;s not done with molly yet .
i have a surprise for you .
you gonna let me go outside ?
even better .
i am gonna set you free .
this bootleg is amazing .
come here .
uh @-@ huh ? yeah .
feel good ?
it feels great .
do i make you feel good ?
you make me feel ...
ohh ! i like that .
you &apos;re good .
come here .
best i ever had .
garcia , dr. weingold at
syracuse general sent us an extensive list
of female patients in their mid @-@ 20s that match our profile .
she &apos;s most likely local ,
raised by a single parent or in foster care .
ok , narrowing it down .
this unsub likes familiar places .
look for extended family or previous addresses .
did any of them grow up near onondaga lake ?
ok . wait , wait . here &apos;s one that might fit .
jane gould .
her grandparents had a house near maple bay ,
which is where gail &apos;s body was found .
are they still alive ?
no . they died when jane was in middle school .
is the grandparents &apos; house currently occupied ?
yeah . water and power all paid up .
that &apos;s the one place she got attention
from a parental figure . she feels at home and in charge there .
i &apos;ll send you an address . i &apos;m calling up her photo right now .
hold on . oh , lord . oh , lord .
this is her . this is the creepy stalker woman
from the surveillance video .
i know .
it hurts .
lyle didn &apos;t even care that you were missing .
how low do you have to be
to let a loser like that hit you ?
very .
very low .
do you see now ?
see what ?
that you deserve better .
it &apos;s not that i deserve better .
i am better .
than who ?
than you .
and lyle .
molly !
molly !
you &apos;re a perfect match .
why did i not see that ?
are you mad about the sex tape ?
you know i did it to help you .
i don &apos;t care why you did it .
that &apos;s your problem .
you &apos;re in denial , molls .
take a good look at yourself .
a sweet little waif holding a stick .
that &apos;s all you are .
molly !
nothing more .
hey . you ok ?
ok , thanks , garcia .
so dr. weingold opened jane &apos;s files .
she can &apos;t release details ,
but she said there honestly aren &apos;t many .
jane never admitted to being a cutter ,
let alone what triggered it .
she started acting out after she lost her grandparents .
arrested for vandalism ,
removed from 2 foster homes for destruction of property .
desperate attempts to get attention .
is that why she started cutting ,
another cry for help ?
cutting is about control ,
similar to anorexia . it &apos;s common in teenage girls
who feel like they have no control over their lives .
her grandparents &apos; deaths were probably the trigger .
the loss of parental figures at such a young age
turns your world upside down .
there &apos;s a lot of pain , but no outlet .
no one &apos;s in charge .
both molly and gail can relate to that .
jane used them to convince herself she &apos;s important .
more than that , she thinks she &apos;s a selfless savior .
instead of an orphan that no one claimed .
stop !
stop ...
help . please , please .
stop--
man down .
it &apos;s clear here .
clear .
well , he &apos;s not cold yet , so we may have just missed her .
after a confrontation like that ,

someplace she feels in control .

and i &apos;ll go on to help others who are lost .
