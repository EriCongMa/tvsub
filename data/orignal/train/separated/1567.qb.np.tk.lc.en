am i too old to get pregnant ?
would you like me to start you on pre @-@ natal vitamins ?
yes .
if callie decides that she does not want to be adopted ,
do you want to be adopted without her ?
i am getting adopted , with or without you .
well , i think you need to have a conversation with callie .
she &apos;s trying to get her own apartment .
you think she &apos;s doing this so she can be with brandon ?
you locked me in a room with some man
who proceeded to tell me that being gay was a sin .
well , i was being a parent , i was pushing you in the right direction .
hey , dad ? dad ?
dad ?
演唱者 dave thomas junior
there you go , dad . that should fix you right up .
how &apos;s the game ?
we &apos;re getting killed .
do you remember when we went to see the padres in chicago that time ?
you were , i don &apos;t know , maybe six or seven ...
how can i forget . that was my first away game , right ?
it was the first time you ever saw snow .
oh my gosh , that &apos;s right . oh , man .
you said , &quot; daddy , why is the sky so dusty . &quot;
your mom and i , oh , we laughed so hard
and you got angry , you said ,
&quot; what ? what &apos;s so funny ? what &apos;s so funny ? &quot;
yeah , well , how was i supposed to know ?
you and mom were laughing at me .
it was a little rude , i think .
that was a great trip .
i miss that .
when things weren &apos;t so ... damn complicated .
me , too , dad . me , too .

that &apos;s life , i guess . but i don &apos;t have any regrets .
we have to put out the bourbon too for the old fashions .
you sure we have enough bitters ?
yes , positive .
and if we need more &quot; bitter , &quot;
we can just ask my mom to tell stories
about all those times she was passed over for tenure .
i &apos;m going to make sure the kids are ready .
oh , listen , speaking of the kids ,
um , what do you wanna do about ,
you know , the whole callie of it all ?
we really don &apos;t think that this independent living thing
has anything to do with brandon , do we ?
no , he says it &apos;s over between the two of them .
in any case , callie &apos;s not allowed to date while she &apos;s in girls united , so ...
so we just keep an eye on them . we can do that .
it &apos;s not like we have anything else going on today .
no .
i &apos;m gonna go rally the troops .
ok .

he called me mom .
hey , callie . can we get you anything ?
some water or ... ?
no , thank you .
ok , well , if you need anything , we &apos;re right here .
it &apos;s too bad my grampa wasn &apos;t there .
but i , for one , will never forget that day .
duh . it &apos;s your mom &apos;s wedding .
well , yeah , but it &apos;s also the first time we kissed .
we should go help set up .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m wearing a padres hat .
that &apos;s how much i liked frank .
well , he and stef and brandon are very grateful , i &apos;m sure .
how is she doing ?
she &apos;s ok . she &apos;s actually a lot better than i expected .
how are you ?
what do you mean ?
i talked to captain roberts .
she said there was some article in the newspaper today .
not now .
mike .
it &apos;s nothing , really . it &apos;s about the shooting .
just some worked up journalist ,
trying to make a story out of nothing .
what ?
hey . what &apos;s up ?
i just asked lena if i could do anything to help .
yes , you know what ?
you can actually help me set up the poker table .
thanks , you guys .
演唱者 andrew combs &amp; shannon wright
ok , i will give you $ 100 if you eat a spoonful of that .
you don &apos;t even have $ 100 .
ok , fine , ten dollars . but it has to be two spoonfuls .
now wait , why does the amount go up
when the price goes down ? no , that &apos;s ridiculous .
eat it . eat it .
no ! no , you eat it !
no ! no ! no !
eww , that &apos;s nasty !
oh ... my ... god .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry . here , let me do it . let me do it .
i got it .
perfect .
aww . i miss you .
i really thought that we were gonna be sisters .
i miss you , too .
but it &apos;s not like we &apos;re never gonna see each other , right ?
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m all the way in indiana or something .
aren &apos;t you like scared of , you know , living on your own ?
not really .
jude and i have been on our own a lot , you know ?
yeah , but you &apos;ve always had each other .
jude &apos;s pretty amazing .
i mean , being 12 , going to his second funeral .
he &apos;s really strong .
yeah , well he took our mom &apos;s death really hard .
he kinda freaked out .
jude , what did you do ?
i just hope he &apos;s ok today .
you know .
hey , um , can i talk to you for a second ?
well , i thought the service was just beautiful .
and the eulogy the pastor gave was perfect .
oh , yeah , he sure does wax poetical , doesn &apos;t he ?
you should have heard the eulogy he gave for my sexuality when i was 16 .
what ?
yeah , that was the guy dad sent me
to when he caught me cuddling on the couch with tess .
he is ?
mm @-@ hm .
then why on earth did you ask him to do the eulogy ?
because he was dad &apos;s minister
and that &apos;s what dad would &apos;ve wanted .
i &apos;m surprised he came .
i never thought he would dare
enter the house of the damned .
so i ... i think maybe we should tell my moms that ,
you know , we &apos;re together .
wait , what ? why ?
well , i mean , we don &apos;t have a reason to hide anymore , right ?
i mean , you &apos;re getting your own place ,
you &apos;re not getting adopted .
so why can &apos;t we ?
i don &apos;t feel like it &apos;s the right time right now , brandon .
i mean , it &apos;s your grandfather &apos;s funeral .
oh , of course , you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
uh , maybe tomorrow ?
brandon , we need you downstairs , the cd &apos;s skipping .
go .
ok .
um , i &apos;ll be right down , i just need a minute .
ok .
ok , we &apos;re leaving . don &apos;t stay up too late .
are you mad ?
don &apos;t be like that . we won &apos;t be long .
can i get a kiss goodbye ?
ok .
see you in the morning .
isn &apos;t it a little ... dark ?
it was dad &apos;s favorite .
why couldn &apos;t his favorite have been cotton candy ?
you can &apos;t be sad when there &apos;s cotton candy .
he used to tell everyone
that black licorice was the only candy he could have in the house
that i wouldn &apos;t steal .
now i love it .
it &apos;s good . you should try some .
right ?
not bad .
not bad .
thanks , hon .
oh , my god . it &apos;s like evil in my mouth .
hello ?
hi . i &apos;m ...
emma , hi . come in .
this is my sister , mariana .
this is emma .
emma &apos;s on the wrestling team with me .
oh , ok , so you &apos;re the crazy girl .
i only mean crazy &apos; cause you &apos;re wrestling with all those boys ,
not &apos; cause you &apos;re actually crazy .
mariana , walk away .
i know this is kinda ...
i told my mom about your grampa
and she made me bring food .
we &apos;re jews , it &apos;s what we do .
it &apos;s noodle kugel . it &apos;s totally delicious .
and it &apos;s organic so , you know , totally dye @-@ free and everything .
you really didn &apos;t have to do this .
try telling my mom that .
do you want me to take your coat ?
ok .
is there something you want to tell me about ?
mike told you ?
mike ?
about the article ? he said he didn &apos;t want to ...
what article ?
lena ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
stef , come on ...
what did this article say ?
it was about police brutality ,
just the whole last section was about me , and the shooting .
are you kidding me ?
no . they make ana &apos;s boyfriend out to be some sort of saint ,
and me some overzealous cop with a vendetta .
they basically accuse me of murdering the guy .
i &apos;m really sorry , mike . i don &apos;t ... can i do anything ?
no , look , all i know is i was supposed to be
going back to work next week
and now they &apos;re not gonna let me .
ok , i &apos;ve got the refills of the pistachios and meatballs .
hey , um , have you seen jude ?
uh , he was out back a little bit ago but ...
ok .
do you need any help ?
yeah , actually , you could take this to the buffet for me .
yeah .
hello , my love ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
nothing . nothing .
it &apos;s just , you know , frank and ...
i just never realized you two were that close .
no , we really weren &apos;t .
i mean , he had his lovable qualities but ...
... more than that , it &apos;s callie is here .
you know , she &apos;s being so sweet , so kind .
i just don &apos;t understand what she &apos;s thinking
with this whole getting @-@ her @-@ own @-@ apartment thing .
it &apos;s completely baffling .
i know .
it &apos;s something else .
lena elizabeth , what &apos;s going on ?
sit .
ok , you can &apos;t say anything . stef would kill me .
all right , but lately ,
i have been thinking a lot
about the fact that ... i never had a baby .
really ?
yes .
and i did this insane thing at the ob @-@ gyn
and had her test my levels and ...
... everything &apos;s good , so technically , i could still ...
oh , honey .
why are you doing this to yourself ?
you only feel this way
because you feel like your clock is running out .
stop torturing yourself . you don &apos;t want a baby .
if you did you &apos;d have one by now .
演唱者 rare monk
you &apos;re moving it .
i swear , i &apos;m not !
come on , you guys , someone is definitely moving this .
this can &apos;t be real .
we need to ask like a test question ,
something nobody knows the answer to .
ok , i &apos;ve got one .
will i ever have a boyfriend ?
now who &apos;s moving it ?
ok , wait , i &apos;ve gotta know who .
what is the name of my first boyfriend ?
who &apos;s z ?
zac .
ok , you know what , i &apos;m good .
this is just a silly board game .
you two &quot; communicate with the spirit world &quot; all you want ,
i &apos;m done .
hey , babe , what are you doing ?
stef , if you are reading that article ,
please don &apos;t do that now . it &apos;s just gonna make you upset .
i &apos;m already upset , lena , so let it be , please .
well ...
that was ...
... something .
are you mad at her ? you &apos;ve been short with her all day .
i think lena is trying to get pregnant .
or thinking about it , anyway .
now , with all you have going on ?
i think so .
i mean but ...
how ?
is she having an affair ?
no , mom !
and what &apos;s worse is , she &apos;s just not talking to me about it .
well , if she won &apos;t come to you , sweetheart ...
... you gotta go to her .
what am i supposed to say , mom ? we can &apos;t have a baby .
演唱者 rosi golan
so what &apos;s up with you and callie ?
are you guys like a couple now ?
is that why she &apos;s getting her own apartment and everything ?
uh , no . no .
no , she just wants to be on her own .
you sure about that ?
well aren &apos;t you a love for helping out .
sweetheart , forgive my candor , but ...
... i understand that you &apos;ve decided
that you don &apos;t want to be adopted anymore .
well , yeah . i &apos;m 16 .
i don &apos;t need to be adopted .
family isn &apos;t just until you &apos;re 18 , you know .
you need them your whole life .
especially at times like these .
no , no , no , don &apos;t knot that .
you &apos;ll never get that out .
no , mom .
no !
you don &apos;t get to do that anymore .
i love you and you &apos;re my mother ,
but your experience is yours and my experience is mine .
i am no longer interested
in hearing what you have to say about it ,
unless it &apos;s , &quot; i love you and i understand . &quot;
well ...
i didn &apos;t realize i was doing that . i apologize .
i never ... i never meant to take anything away from you .
i &apos;m very proud of you , for saying all that .
i just don &apos;t know why it took you so long .
you just can &apos;t help yourself , can you ?
what do you want from me ?
well , since now we &apos;re being totally honest ,
isn &apos;t there something that you need to say to your wife ?
something about a baby ?
oh , my god , you suck !
are you gonna get that ?
no , i &apos;ll call her later .
hey , what are you ... ? hey .
hey , i was just calling to see how the funeral went .
uh , sorry ,
i didn &apos;t know you had company .
who &apos;s this ?
hi , i &apos;m emma .
hi .
jesus told me that there was a girl on the wrestling team .
but you are not what i was expecting .
i get that a lot . people think to be a wrestler
you have to be built like a mac truck or something .
no , i mean , i didn &apos;t ...
yeah , i guess that is what i was thinking .
&quot; to &quot; ? what does that mean ?
&quot; toy &quot; ?
do you think they &apos;re trying to tell us
that the ouija board is just a toy , and that we shouldn &apos;t play with it ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
oh my god ! frank just gave us a new toyota .
he got you a new car ?
stef is making us give it away .
why ?
maybe he wants us to keep it .
you didn &apos;t push it ?
can we do one more ?
yeah , sure .
mom . are you there ?
mom ...
... is it ok if stef and lena adopt me ?
and now for the pastry .
are you kidding me ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
these are dodger cupcakes ,
they &apos;re supposed to be padres cupcakes . oh , my ...
i didn &apos;t check the box before ...
my dad hated the dodgers . this is ridiculous .
i &apos;ll just go pick up some plain ones .
you know what ? they &apos;re cupcakes . this is stupid .
i &apos;ll just put them out like this .
go padres !
callie , what &apos;s wrong ?
my necklace .
i lost my necklace .
um ... i guess the clasp must &apos;ve broken .
the little gold coin thingy ? were you wearing it today ?
i wear it every day .
stay calm and retrace your steps .
i &apos;ve been all over the house , the backyard .
when did you last see it ?
um , i don &apos;t know , this afternoon , i think .
it &apos;ll be ok , we &apos;ll find it .
i lost my wedding ring once in the trash .
that was a day to remember , i &apos;ll tell you .
what &apos;s going on ?
uh , callie misplaced her necklace .
i didn &apos;t misplace it , ok , i lost it ! i &apos;m stupid .
callie , honey ,
i &apos;m sorry , but if you lost it we can just replace it .
please don &apos;t ! just leave me alone please .
it was our mom &apos;s necklace .
callie , it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s not .
callie , you &apos;re freaking me out .
you &apos;re acting like you did when we found out that mom died .
what are you talking about ?
when you destroyed your room .
that was you , jude .
you destroyed my room .
no , callie .
it was you .
oh , my god .
jude , can i have a minute with callie please .
lena was only trying to help , you know .
i know , i &apos;m sorry .
honey , that necklace is not your mom .
i know that it &apos;s important to you .
it &apos;s the only thing of her i have left .
no , it &apos;s not , honey .
you have her and all those memories .
and those are never gonna get lost .
sit down , have a seat .
talk to me .
you know , you have ...
you &apos;ve never said one word about her , your mom .
tell me about this woman who created ...
... the amazing girl sitting in front of me , please .
i didn &apos;t kiss her goodbye .
you what ?
and ... i nev ...
the night she died , i didn &apos;t .
oh , callie .
i should &apos;ve kissed her goodbye .
baby . oh , honey .
let it go .
you know , the last thing i said to my dad was to
pretty much take the car and shove it .
it &apos;s hard to lose someone you love
and you never ever want to feel that pain again .
now the problem with that is ,
the only way to make sure that doesn &apos;t happen
is you shut yourself off .
and you stop loving . that &apos;s no way to live .
i know it &apos;s scary to open yourself back up again .
do you know that most of the time ...
... i feel like i have five separate hearts ,
running around outside of me .
it &apos;s you kids .
thanks for making that koodle or whatever you call it .
kugel . and you &apos;re welcome , even though you didn &apos;t even try it .
i promise , when i get back inside i &apos;m gonna try it .
it was nice meeting all your family .
now i know why you &apos;re so bizarre .
really ? says the girl who &apos;s on the wrestling team .
lexi seems nice .
yeah , she &apos;s great .
so ... is she coming back ?
i mean , how long is she gonna be in honduras ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll see you at practice tomorrow ?
okay .
thanks for letting me crash your funeral .
bye .
well , i think it &apos;s time i took my leave .
thank you very much . you have a lovely home .
thank you .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m surprised you came .
well , people &apos;s attitudes evolve , stef .
even your father .
he came to me very often , trying to reconcile his faith with ...
your lifestyle .
it was very difficult for him .
so am i supposed to be happy about that ?
that your father was questioning his fundamental beliefs
because of his love for you ?
yes .
i should think that would make you happy .
well , i should get home . thank you so much .
frank was very important to me , and to all of us at church .
and you have a beautiful family .
yeah .
hi , captain .
i &apos;m sorry . am i too late ?
no , no , no .
i had to go down to the station .
it &apos;s fine . why don &apos;t you grab some dessert or something , ok ?
ok .
hey , mike .
captain .
so i got a courtesy call from the da &apos;s office .
that article in the paper today has really stirred the pot .
there &apos;s been a ton of public outcry ...
um ... well , look , he &apos;s decided to
start an investigation , to see if he can press charges .
what ?
we &apos;re gonna do everything we can ,
and the union will make sure to provide you with ...
provide a lawyer if i need one ?
god ! this is unbelievable !
i thought this was supposed to go away .
i was supposed to go back to work .
now what ? i could end up going to jail ?
not if i have anything to say about it .
the problem is , you don &apos;t , captain .
you found it ?
yeah .
you &apos;re my hero .
演唱者 adrianne gonzalez
i love you , brandon .
i love you , too .
but ...
i know .
i know .
i need a family .
and this , you , all of you ,
you are my family .
so i don &apos;t think that we can do this anymore .
you know ?
i never realized until today
that for us to be together , you have to give up everything .
and that &apos;s not really fair of me to ask .
brandon ?
uh , yeah , grandma .
i was wondering if you might come in and play a little something ?
it &apos;s so quiet in there , you &apos;d think it was a funeral .
yeah . sure .
what are you wearing ?
it &apos;s frank &apos;s . i was cold .
i kinda wanted him to be buried in it .
but i &apos;m glad we didn &apos;t . i think i &apos;ll keep it though .
he was wearing this the last time he told me he loved me .
so you gonna come in and play a little something for ol &apos; frank ?
yeah .
what about you , callie , you coming ?
uh , i think i &apos;m just gonna ...
... stay out here a minute , if it &apos;s ok .
sure . you all right , doll ?
i am .
you found mom &apos;s necklace ?
yeah .
i &apos;m coming home , jude .
i wanna come home .
i need you kids to pack a bag .
we &apos;re gonna take you to stay with a very nice family
called the segals for a little while .
what about our dad ?
your dad is in jail .
he was drinking before the accident ,
and several people , including your mom , were killed .
you &apos;re not gonna split us up , are you ?
&apos;cause i won &apos;t leave my brother .
we &apos;re not gonna separate you , i promise .
we &apos;re gonna keep you together
until we can find a home for you both .
where &apos;s mom ?
i think she went out front .
thank you for the car , dad . it &apos;s gonna be a lifesaver .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying this
but i &apos;m gonna miss the hell out of you .
i know you did the best that you could ,
best way you knew how .
and i want you to know that i forgive you .
i love you , daddy .
go padres .
it &apos;s snowing .
yeah .
so ...
do you wanna have a baby ?
