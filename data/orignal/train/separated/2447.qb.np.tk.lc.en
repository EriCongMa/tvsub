i don &apos;t know what we were
or what we &apos;re supposed to be ,
i &apos;ve never felt more alive .
in our coven &apos;s tradition ,
after their 22nd birthday ,
the twins merge their strength .
the weaker one dies .
i &apos;ll find a way .
i &apos;m not gonna let you die .
i hate you for ruining our friendship ,
and i think that i deserve better than that .
i haven &apos;t been there for her .
caroline needed me , and i ran away .
you &apos;re dying , mom .
and we &apos;re out of options .
which is why i gave my blood to a cancer patient .
and i healed him .
i am not ready to lose you now .
i want you to live for me .
everything &apos;s gonna be ok .
caroline forbes .
colin ?
what the hell did you do to me ?
what ?
my mom &apos;s still sleeping .
don &apos;t wake her up .
what happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
h @-@ he was fine when we left him at duke , remember ?
he was running around and pain @-@ free
and scarfing down all that disgusting vending machine food .
yeah ? well , clearly , he &apos;s not fine now .
wait . i thought you compelled him to forget everything
after you fed him your blood .
how did he find you ?
i don &apos;t know .
what if this blood isn &apos;t even his ?
is there any chance that your mom signed the house over to you ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe .
she &apos;s been running around like crazy ,
saying she need to get her ducks in a row or ...
he &apos;s a vampire ,
which means after you fed him your blood ...
he died .
calculator . calculator .
where is the calculator ?
of course . under the catatonic serial killer .
sandwich ?
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m late for my volunteer shift at the hospital .
ok .
ooh . that &apos;s new .
oh , yeah . jo made me a new daylight ring .
you like ?
depends . does it work ?
well , i &apos;m here , aren &apos;t i ?
yeah , inside in the shade .
i know everyone has their doubts about jo &apos;s magic ,
but she has an entire month to get stronger
and win the merge with kai ,
so a little bit of support wouldn &apos;t kill anybody .
speaking of killing people .
still counting sheep
or whatever the hell you psychopaths dream of ?
look . alaric &apos;s gone out of town
to get some mystical thingamabob
to give jo an edge ,
and your job is to baby @-@ sit kai ,
not smother him with a pillow .
fine .
and if he starts twitching or something ,
just give him 50 milligrams of pentobarbital .
you &apos;re so cute when you &apos;re all doctorly .
you forgot this .
you &apos;re not free tonight by any chance , are you ,
because i know this little italian joint
that has eggplant so good
you actually think you &apos;re eating people .
and i happen to have a weird eggplant obsession .
perfect .
great !
and i &apos;m thinking maybe after that
go to the art house theater .
they &apos;re playing some pretentious french flick .
i don &apos;t speak french , damon .
not to see the movie , silly ,
but to hide in the back and throw popcorn at hipsters .
wait . we &apos;ve gone on this date already , haven &apos;t we ?
damon , that &apos;s cheating , ok ?
you already know everything about me .
cheating ? cheating is erasing all of our epic memories .
that &apos;s cheating .
i &apos;m serious .
look . if we &apos;re gonna do this ,
then we can &apos;t just pick up where we left off
because i don &apos;t remember where that is .
i understand .
where would you like to start ?
at the beginning .
i &apos;m off at 6 : 00 . you can pick me up then .
fine .
fine .
great .
great .
good .
bye .
bye .
how about atlantis
or , like , the sea of tranquility ?
on the moon ?
i hear it &apos;s nice there .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s very tranquil .
i &apos;m serious .
pick a real place .
why are we talking about spending spring break
anywhere other than this tiny bed ,
which we should probably leave at some point today .
ignore that .
olivia , you home ?
olivia ?
oh , my god . he &apos;s early .
who &apos;s early ?
sweetheart , it &apos;s your old man .
here . put this on .
your dad ? what &apos;s he doing here ?
he wants to take luke and me out to dinner .
hide !
dad , hi ! i @-@ i thought we were meeting later .
well , we were , but i wanted a couple of extra minutes with my girl .
happy birthday .
thanks .
i adjusted mrs. murphy &apos;s dose of fentanyl .
keep an eye on her . thanks .
phesmatos tribum , plantus vivifae ,
plantus ... hederus .
should i call it ?
time of death-- anybody &apos;s guess .
well , in the magical win column ,
i just walked across campus without bursting into flame ,
so there &apos;s that .
i need help .
i had duke send over colin &apos;s medical records .
this head scan is from earlier this week .
this one ...
was taken right here 10 minutes ago .
see all that red ?
well , i &apos;m no doctor , but that guy is screwed .
so the blood didn &apos;t heal him .
it sped up his cancer and killed him .
so now i have a stage 10 cancer patient ,
which by the way doesn &apos;t exist ,
who is beyond terminally ill and a vampire ,
meaning all of his emotions are heightened ,
and he can &apos;t die .
hey . no offense , but can someone tell me
why i was called down here to listen
to the story of colin the cancer vamp--
because caroline fed me her blood last night ,
so the same thing is gonna happen to me .
any news ?
no , not yet . it &apos;s a little outside of jo &apos;s expertise .
did you know
that caroline was gonna give her mom vampire blood ?
yeah . i was there when it healed colin .
and then you left , and then he died ,
so it didn &apos;t actually heal him .
it did the opposite .
caroline had every reason to think it would work .
yeah , but you didn &apos;t , stefan .
you &apos;re , like , 165 years old .
you &apos;ve worked as a paramedic at hospitals .
so that makes me an expert in supernatural cancer treatment .
i just wish that you &apos;d done a little bit more research
or waited , uh , like a day .
because you were thinking so rationally when damon died , right ?
her mother is terminal .
you didn &apos;t see the hope in her eyes
when she thought that maybe her mother didn &apos;t have to die ,
and i didn &apos;t want to be the one to take that away from her .
jo has an idea .
medically speaking , this is our best option .
if vampire blood is the issue ,
then a full transfusion of human blood
might stabilize her condition .
please sound less confident , doc .
look . we are in uncharted territory here ,
but this isn &apos;t just a medical problem , damon .
it &apos;s a magical one .
well , then you &apos;re uniquely qualified--
witch doctor and all .
now you believe in my magic . gee , thanks .
unfortunately , this goes beyond any witch ability i &apos;ve ever heard of ,
but please if you have a better plan ,
i &apos;m all ears .
why did you tell me your birthday was in two weeks ?
to avoid this exact conversation .
am i wearing too much eyeliner ?
if you and luke are 22,
that means you &apos;re old enough to merge .
that &apos;s why luke and i are gonna bust out
our wonder twin powers of persuasion ,
make dad think that jo &apos;s powerful to overpower kai ,
and luke and i won &apos;t have to do the merge .
you &apos;re wearing way too much makeup ,
and he shouldn &apos;t be here .
he &apos;s not staying ,
and why are you wearing a tie ?
i &apos;m about to ask the leader of the gemini coven
to let us out of a centuries @-@ old tradition .
i kind of need him to take me seriously .
you should let me talk to him .
really bad idea .
promise me that you &apos;ll stay out of it .
what happens if you don &apos;t convince him ?
we will .
you die .
you and luke merge , luke wins , you die .
do you trust me ?
do i have a choice ?
then don &apos;t worry .
you &apos;re not gonna lose me .
&quot; hey , the blood transfusions
are stopping the cancer from eating her alive , &quot;
or &quot; hey , is there a sheriff @-@ sized space
available in the family crypt &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know . jo &apos;s still running some tests to find that out .
she should be out in a minute .
i don &apos;t know if you remember this ,
but liz and i are pretty close .
yeah .
i mean , as far as humans go , she &apos;s ...
tolerable .
i can see how much you care about her ,
but we all do , so if there &apos;s anything we can do to fix this ,
trust me , we will .
yeah .
the coffee machine &apos;s broken .
seriously , what kind of hospital is this ?
if you can &apos;t fix a coffee machine ,
then how are you supposed to be able to fix people ?
sure you don &apos;t need some real food ?
there &apos;s probably a machine around here that vends o positive .
we screwed up big time .
why did i feed her that blood ?
you were trying to help .
no . i was trying to fix something
that i had no business trying to fix .
it &apos;s like textbook definition of control freak from hell .
listen . you are an optimist .
you want to believe that anything is possible ,
and that is exactly what your mom needs to hear right now .
ok ?
that &apos;s colin &apos;s room .
i can &apos;t die .
why can &apos;t i die ?
calm down , calm down .
it &apos;s ok , it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s not ok !
i &apos;m agony . i can hear my tumors growing .
ok . we &apos;ll try to help , but just please stop hurting yourself .
you want to help me ?
help me die .
why the hell did you do that ?
he made a wish .
i granted it .
the blood transfusion didn &apos;t work ,
so you didn &apos;t just kill him , blondie .
that &apos;s enough , damon .
no . it &apos;s fine .
he &apos;s just saying what everyone else is thinking .
i killed my mom .
it &apos;s caroline .
leave a message .
caroline , where are you ?
call me , or better idea ,
just ... just come back .
how are you feeling ?
like a human pin cushion .
so ... what &apos;s the verdict ?
did the blood swap work ?
we &apos;re not sure yet .
i mean , jo &apos;s still doing some tests .
you shouldn &apos;t lie to sick people , elena .
it &apos;s bad kama .
they thought it would slow down the cancer cells from replicating ,
but it didn &apos;t work .
i &apos;m sorry .
how &apos;s caroline ?
she &apos;s good . she just ran out to get some food .
elena .
she just took off ,
and now i can &apos;t find her ,
i can &apos;t get ahold of her .
she &apos;s not gonna forgive herself for this , is she ?
i &apos;ll make sure that we find her .
i promise .
thank you .
good ! you &apos;re here .
i actually need a second opinion .
i kind of like this because sunflowers are her favorite flower ,
but at the same time , i was also thinking
maybe they &apos;re a little too over @-@ the @-@ top cheerful
for a memorial service ,
so this was the second option ,
um , because roses are classic , right ?
i mean , especially in this shade of pink .
obviously , i would change out the vase , but ... ahem .
if you &apos;re thinking of saying something to make me feel better , don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t deserve to feel better .
i wasn &apos;t .
good .
i was actually thinking that you have far more important things to do
than plan a memorial service for your mother ,
who &apos;s still a live , by the way .
yeah , but all of this still needs to be done , right ?
she &apos;s not gonna want to live out the rest of her life
as a vampire in excruciating pain ,
so i should do something that i &apos;m good at
instead of making everything worse .
which arrangement ?
caroline , you took a risk .
it didn &apos;t pay off , but you did it out of love .
you made your mother sicker , ok ,
but what are you gonna do now ?
are you just gonna bury your head in the sand ?
i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t know what to say to her .
you don &apos;t have to say anything to her .
just sit with her .
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t even fff--
face her .
look . when i was young ,
my mom , she got really sick ,
and instead of spending time with her ,
i did everything i could to avoid her ,
like picking out her favorite flowers
or walking into town to get the tea that she liked ,
and i pretended like i was doing it for her ,
but i wasn &apos;t .
i was just afraid to see her like that ,
and then my dad , he , uh ...
he sent her away , and she died .
i would give anything to have one more day with her .
what if she can &apos;t forgive me ?
she doesn &apos;t think there &apos;s anything to forgive .
she just wants you to be with her .
you &apos;re refusing to merge ?
we want to consider other options .
there are no other options .
if a set of twins doesn &apos;t merge ,
then the gemini bloodline will cease to exist upon my death .
that means the entire coven will die .
is that what you want ?
no , of course not , but you are in perfect health ,
kai is on ice .
that means we have time to figure this out .
there &apos;s nothing to figure out .
this is what you were born to do .
no , dad . this is why kai and jo were born .
we were just the backup plan you bred
because you thought that your first batch had a design flaw .
kai is a psychopath ,
an extremely dangerous one .
dad , jo can do this .
she can win .
all we &apos;re asking is that you give her a chance .
i &apos;m not asking you to do anything i haven &apos;t done myself .
that &apos;s easy for you to say ?
you merged with your twin brother , and you won .
you didn &apos;t drop dead .
it doesn &apos;t work like that , and you know it .
one will absorb traits from the other .
both of your souls will unite into a new being .
who looks exactly like me .
yeah , i know i &apos;m stronger than liv ,
so that means i will win if we merge ,
so you can put whatever poetic spin you want on it ,
but i will be killing my own sister .
i can &apos;t do that to her .
bad timing , lockwood . i &apos;m in a mood .
what the hell are you doing ?
i &apos;ll make it easier on you .
i &apos;ll give you multiple choice .
a-- &quot; i &apos;m being an idiot . &quot;
b-- &quot; i have anger issues , and i &apos;m a puny human now ,
and i have to pick on people while they sleep . &quot;
c-- &quot; a and b are both correct . &quot;
liv &apos;s dad is in town .
really .
she &apos;s trying to convince him to let jo and kai do the merge .
oh , so you just thought you &apos;d come and grab kai as a failsafe .
in case papa parker says no to liv and luke ,
you just turn him loose , and he merges with jo anyway , huh ?
while i appreciate your efforts ,
he &apos;s a psycho freak magic siphon .
i &apos;m not gonna just let you walk out wit him .
i could kiss you right now ,
you beautiful moron .
what are you talking about ?
yep . that stuff works really well .
nighty night .
that should keep you down for an hour .
not a good time .
well , i &apos;m sorry to hear that , twinderella .
big pitch going south , is it ?
where &apos;s tyler ?
well , the good news is your boyfriend and i ,
i think , have come up with a solution .
now it &apos;s a bit of a hail mary ,
but i think everybody gets what they need .
i just have to ask papa parker one question ,
so do you mind putting him on ?
i want to talk to tyler .
he &apos;s , uh , out at the moment .
yes ?
hello , sir . damon salvatore here .
we had thanksgiving together .
anyway , i &apos;ve been sitting here googling
celestial events happening today ,
and i was just curious .
would a mercury @-@ venus conjunction give you
enough juice to do a little gemini merge party ?
why ?
i &apos;m gonna take that evasive answer as a yes .
so here &apos;s the situation .
i &apos;m gonna need you to use that planet party
to merge your set of blond twins asap
because , well , unfortunately your formerly comatose son
is gonna be on the loose and hell @-@ bent on beating you to the punch .
rise and shine , you little weasel .
ooh ! trying to pop a blood vessel in my brain ?
sorry . not gonna work .
looks like all that magic you sucked up
drained away while you were asleep ,
which is good for me .
don &apos;t worry . i know where you can get more .
you really think i &apos;m gonna trust you ?
no , and i &apos;m not gonna trust you .
i just happen to need a magic siphon ,
and you &apos;re the only game in town .
let &apos;s discuss my fee .
all right . i need a 12 @-@ gauge needle stat .
don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do with it ,
but i need it .
you &apos;re not a doctor , so stop playing games ,
but i am a vampire ,
and i will rip your head off
if you screw this up .
what she said ,
so do your stupid little magic suction trick
and suck the magic out of her right now .
i get what you two see in each other .
it &apos;s very dys @-@ fun @-@ ctional .
ha ! you see what i did , stressing the &quot; fun &quot; in dysfunctional ?
just get on with it , kai .
listening to you talk makes me want to die .
that &apos;s good .
is it working ?
i have no idea .
what the hell is going on ?
what is he doing here ?
hey , sis . little busy .
be with you in a jiffy .
elena ?
i &apos;m gonna let damon explain it .
i &apos;m staying with you .
have you actually lost your mind ?
hey . shh . listen . you told me liz was gonna die
in 8 hours if the magic kept doing its thing .
he steals magic . you made it through med school .
i figured you &apos;d know where i was going with this .
if you think kai is doing this out of the goodness of his heart ,
i can assure you he doesn &apos;t have one .
what &apos;s the price ?
he wants to merge
tonight .
there . all done .
sheriff , hey . how are you feeling ?
you ok ?
yeah . yeah , i think so .
oh , my god . no , no , no .
i think she &apos;s having a heart attack .
that is so tragic ,
you know , because you guys jumped through hoops
to get the magic out of her system ,
but then her ticker &apos;s just
not strong enough to take a little siphon .
kai , you have to fix this !
i can &apos;t merge tonight .
i am not ready .
you almost burned my house down .
don &apos;t you think i know that ?
luckily for you , it &apos;s all been taken care of .
damon , what the hell did you do ?
look . i--
magical neck snap .
never gets old .
isn &apos;t this the part where you start running ?
i &apos;ve spent my entire life running from you .
i &apos;m not running anymore .
what are you doing out here ?
just thinking about how proud i am of you and your brother .
built a good life for yourselves here .
does that mean you &apos;ll think about what we asked ?
of course .
we share a history ,
a bloodline .
we &apos;re in this together .
we &apos;re family .
sanguinem desimilus ,
sanguinem generis finatus .
sanguinem desimilus ,
sanguinem generis finatus .
you &apos;re merging us ?
kai has been released .
he &apos;s going after jo .
i can &apos;t let him get to her !
dad , stop !
i &apos;m gonna kill her .
she &apos;s not strong enough , dad !
i &apos;m sorry .
she &apos;s not strong enough , dad !
there &apos;s no other option .
sanguinem desimilus ,
sanguinem generis finatus .
she said no !
tyler !
tyler , stop !
he was going to kill you .
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine .
luke , where are you going ?
you trust me ?
where are you going ?
i &apos;ll be back soon .
promise .
look at those pretty planets ,
all twinkly and bright .
oh , josette , you would not believe how sick i am of eclipses .
let &apos;s just get this over with .
you know , if you think i didn &apos;t spend
the last 18 years in solitary thinking
about how you screwed me over last time ,
you &apos;re wrong .
so if this just another setup ,
i &apos;ll rip something out more important than a spleen
like a tongue
or a heart .
so any closing remarks ?
you &apos;re a parasite .
you killed the people i loved ,
you shoved a hunting knife in my gut ,
you destroyed my life .
now i &apos;m gonna destroy yours .
i guess we &apos;ll see ...
won &apos;t we ?
sanguinem desimilus .
sanguinem generis finatus .
sanguinem desimilus .
sanguinem generis finatus .
sanguinem desimilus .
sanguinem generis finatus .
what the hell did you just do ?
oh , i just gave my big sister a little magic knock on the head ,
but don &apos;t worry .
she &apos;ll be fine .
because you &apos;re gonna merge with me .
you want to merge with me .
i hate to break it to you , little brother ,
but we &apos;re not twins , all right ?
that &apos;s not how this is supposed to work .
well , that &apos;s true ,
but we share the same parents ,
the same bloodline ,
and thanks to your timeout in the magic penalty box .
we &apos;re the same age .
so it &apos;s definitely a hail mary ,
and--and maybe it won &apos;t work .
but i &apos;d do anything to save my sister &apos;s life .
so ...
we &apos;re gonna give it the old college try .
thanks , but i &apos;m gonna pass .
phasmatos motus arrovox .
what &apos;s wrong ?
are you afraid to play chicken with someone
who might actually beat you ?
fine . it &apos;s your funeral .
stay with me , sheriff .
breathe !
elena , hey .
what happened ?
it &apos;s her heart . i &apos;m losing her , damon .
ok . no offense , elena ,
but i think we need to get a real doctor .
so find one now !
sanguinem desimilus ,
sanguinem generis finatus .
sanguinem desimilus ,
sanguinem generis finatus .
sanguinem desimilus ,
sanguinem generis finatus .
sanguinem desimilus ,
sanguinem generis finatus .
sanguinem desimilus ,
sanguinem generis finatus .
luke , no !
sanguinem desimilus ,
sanguinem generis finatus .
sanguinem desimilus ...
luke , no !
sanguinem generis finatus .
sanguinem desimilus ,
sanguinem generis finatus .
no !
luke .
come on . luke , luke , wake up .
how long has she been down ?
what does that mean ? dead ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know . maybe i think it was a minute .
it feels like an hour .
clear !
caroline ?
honey , i &apos;m leaving .
do you want to say good @-@ bye ?
i compelled you to save her .
unless you want me to gouge your eyes out ,
i suggest you keep working . here .
i &apos;ve done all that i can do .
she &apos;s gone . i &apos;m sorry .
get out of here . forget you &apos;re a total failure .
no . no . no . i will not let this happen .
wake up !
she &apos;s gone .
come on .
no . no , no , no !
mom , mom , mom !
mommy ! no , mom !
no .
don &apos;t leave me , please .
please don &apos;t .
please don &apos;t leave me , mom .
caroline ?
didn &apos;t you hear me , sweetheart ?
it &apos;s time for me to go .
you don &apos;t want to say good @-@ bye to your mom ?
mom ?
it &apos;s ok , baby . i &apos;m right here .
mom .
it &apos;s ok . i &apos;m right here .
it &apos;s ok .
i &apos;m right here .
it &apos;s ok , it &apos;s ok .
where are you going ?
i @-@ i need some air
or some water or something
because ...
she almost died in my arms , damon .
caroline &apos;s mom almost died in my arms .
i thought you wanted to start over
because , fyi , this is exactly where we left off .
i don &apos;t care .
life &apos;s too short .
immortal or not , i don &apos;t want to waste another minute .
hello , stranger .
are you ok ?
i &apos;ve just been sitting here trying to figure out what to say .
i guess i should lead with i &apos;m sorry for almost killing you .
oh , sweetheart , please .
you know me .
i &apos;m the world &apos;s unluckiest gambler .
i &apos;m just sorry that i wasn &apos;t here .
i couldn &apos;t , and--
no , no , no , no .
this wasn &apos;t your fault .
i need you to stop beating yourself up .
can you do that for me ?
ok .
can you say it like you mean it ?
i will .
mom , you put the house in my name .
couple weeks ago .
just in case anything--
yeah . well , i don &apos;t--
i &apos;m not ready for that yet .
i &apos;m sorry ,
and i promise you i will stick around as long as i can ,
ok ?
ok .
come here .
where &apos;d you get that ?
oh , i guess someone fixed the coffee machine .
that smells amazing .
i would give you a million dollars for a decaf latte .
what do you say ?
would you mind getting one for your poor , sick mom ?
i can do that .
ok .
i &apos;ll be right back .
so looks like we can cross miracle cure off the list .
must be some other option .
i need you to promise me something .
ok .
when i &apos;m gone , caroline is gonna need you ,
even if she doesn &apos;t know it .
she &apos;s gonna need someone to help her move on with her life ,
someone to just make her smile .
promise me that you will do that , stefan .
i promise .
luke .
luke , wake up .
luke .
good . you &apos;re still alive .
that &apos;s gonna save me a huge blowout with ric when he gets back ,
but i &apos;m definitely coming into something late .
luke showed up , and he merged with kai .
so i guess adding the words &quot; twin merge &quot;
to my vocabulary was pointless
because they ain &apos;t twins .
he &apos;s not supposed to be here .
the only reason he &apos;s here is because you let kai out !
luke , luke , wake up . wake up , luke .
well , uh , let me give him some of my blood .
it wouldn &apos;t help .
it &apos;s up to them now .
whoever wakes up is the winner ,
and whoever doesn &apos;t ...
can you hear me ?
can--can you hear me ?
why the hell won &apos;t luke call me back ?
do you want me to go look for him ?
yes . no ! i don &apos;t know .
dad .
what has your brother done ?
luke ?
w @-@ w @-@ wake up , luke .
come on .
oh , my god .
we have to leave now .
she &apos;s not going anywhere with you .
luke is gone .
what ?
i feel it .
he merged with kai . kai won .
luke is gone .
i don &apos;t believe you .
we have to run , olivia .
i &apos;m not going anywhere with you !
you think he &apos;s gonna keep you safe ?
she &apos;s staying with me !
you change your mind ,
you know where to find us .
it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s ok .
oh my god .
