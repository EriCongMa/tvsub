wait .
we &apos;re all in this together ,
that could be &quot; a &quot; or it could be alison .
has anyone talked to ali ?
she calls , but i don &apos;t pick up .
you guys , i had a bad thought .
what &apos;s this one ?
ali left town , but &quot; a &quot; said she couldn &apos;t .
what changed ?
i enrolled at the harrisburg police academy .
you can &apos;t just become a policeman .
why not ?
paige , we need to talk .
yeah , we should talk .
tanner thinks we killed bethany young .
spencer , i don &apos;t think the police
believe a thing that ali is saying .
she was a stranger and i buried her alive ,
because i thought i was protecting you .
melissa killed bethany young .
she thought that she just buried her .
she thought that i killed her .
i &apos;m not talking to tanner .
neither am i.
i didn &apos;t think it was you .
oh , my god .
alison .
when she finishes with me ,
she &apos;ll come after you and the others .
she can &apos;t trust you anymore .
i &apos;ll take your statement now , one at a time .
hanna , let &apos;s head over to the porch .
you can walk me through this .
no .
no , i @-@ i @-@ i can &apos;t go back up there .
i don &apos;t want to see that again .
you saw all the blood in there .
there &apos;s no way anyone could have lived through that .
&quot; it &apos;s all your fault . a. &quot;
we &apos;re going to ask you several questions that we know are true .
then i will ask you questions that we don &apos;t know .
your body &apos;s responses will indicate
whether you &apos;re being honest with us or not .
maybe we should wait for tanner .
when you tell the truth , you use your memory .
when you lie , you &apos;re using your imagination .
the sensors will detect that change .
do you understand how it works ?
answer verbally .
i understand .
so we &apos;ll begin .
are you sitting down ?
yes .
what color is your shirt ?
white with pink flowers .
state your legal name .
alison lauren dilaurentis .
come in .
you &apos;ve got company .
who is it ?
come see for yourself .
why the grim faces .
did somebody die ?
mona , we need your help .
what did she do to you ?
nothing ...
yet .
it &apos;s what we think she &apos;s about to do .
we just found out that ali &apos;s at the police station .
she &apos;s talking to the cops .
and you don &apos;t know what she &apos;s telling them .
a lie gets halfway around the world
before the truth has a chance to get its pants on .
did ali say that ?
no . churchill did .
churchill did .
look , we &apos;ve been lying for ali ever since she got back .
we need to know what story she &apos;s telling the cops .
so why not ask her ?
because we don &apos;t believe she &apos;ll tell us the truth .
and why do you think that i can help you ?
because you &apos;re mona .
who else was in the barn that night ?
aria montgomery .
hanna marin .
and emily fields .
when you left the barn , were they all still sleeping ?
yes .
where did you last see spencer hastings ?
alison stole my life from me
when she crowned me rosewood &apos;s biggest loser .
and she was so convincing , even i started to believe her .
so that means you &apos;ll help us ?
look , i know i owe you guys for everything i &apos;ve done to you .
but i &apos;m already number one on her hit list .
if alison finds out i &apos;m siding with you guys ,
i &apos;m afraid to think of how far she &apos;d go to stop me .
are you really that scared of her ?
aren &apos;t you ?
isn &apos;t that why you &apos;re here ?
i don &apos;t mean to interrupt your girl @-@ talk ,
but i wanted to bring these out while they &apos;re still warm .
hanna , is chocolate chip still your favorite ?
so nice of you .
but we have to go .
i &apos;ll send some home with you .
i &apos;ll be right back .
have you ever been so focused on something
that it takes over everything else ?
turns you into someone that you &apos;re not ?
i took all of my ali @-@ anger out on you guys and ...
i &apos;m sorry for that .
han .
i &apos;m waiting for the cookies .
did you figure out what you &apos;re gonna do
with your sister &apos;s going @-@ away present ?
melissa sent me that video
because she wanted me to know the truth .
her confession doesn &apos;t actually help any of us .
she said it out loud .
she buried bethany .
she killed her .
yeah , because she thought that i was the one who hit her .
but you didn &apos;t .
we all know that , spence .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
in melissa &apos;s story i &apos;m an accessory to murder .
that &apos;s best case scenario .
here you go .
thank you , mrs. v.
and they are still my favorite .
see you at school ?
yeah .
well , it was nice to see you .
hanna ...
i need to ask .
now that she &apos;s back ...
alison , is it starting again ?
i &apos;m not friends with alison anymore .
so i don &apos;t really don &apos;t know what she &apos;s doing .
but i do think that mona &apos;s afraid of her .
we all are .
send out a code &quot; a. &quot;
she &apos;s plotting something big .
lock the door . i think somebody is following me .
where is everybody ?
they &apos;re not coming .
why ?
alison got to them .
they &apos;re convinced that she &apos;s the saint
and you &apos;re &quot; crazy mona . &quot;
that &apos;s what they &apos;re calling you now .
do you think you can be crazy and not know it ?
if you start to believe that , she wins .
i &apos;m talking about alison .
i think she &apos;s gone full @-@ on socio .
alison volunteered to take the polygraph .
how do you know that ?
she &apos;s mona .
after you left last night , i did some recon .
alison would never put herself at risk
unless she believed her story .
well , if you believe a lie , it becomes a truth .
and why lie to yourself unless ...
you did something so bad
you don &apos;t want to believe that you did it .
or you &apos;re playing a game .
you think that ali took the lie detector test for fun ?
i think she took it because she &apos;s not having fun anymore .
she can &apos;t play with her dolls if you won &apos;t let her .
this is how she &apos;s ending the game .
what game ?
the game .
the one she stole from me .
you think that alison &apos;s &quot; a &quot; ?
i &apos;m not the only one having bad thoughts .
she assembled the perfect group .
smart , loyal ,
admiring and compassionate .
perfect group for what ?
for a sociopath to manipulate .
alison would have gotten bored with any one of you .
but all together ...
we &apos;re a challenge .
i never understood why alison chose me ,
what made me so special .
when you don &apos;t feel anything ,
it must be really fun to mess with somebody who feels a lot .
alison picked you because you care .
and she can &apos;t .
so are we really saying that alison &apos;s &quot; a &quot; out loud ?
she never loved me .
she never loved any of us .
guys , if mona &apos;s right ,
if ali is ending the game because we cut her off ,
then she went to the cops to convince them
that she &apos;s innocent and we &apos;re the guilty ones .
guilty of what ?
everything .
look , i can find out what she told the cops .
maybe it &apos;ll give you guys a fighting chance
to get your stories straight .
mona , why are you helping us ?
i got early acceptance letters from three colleges ,
but i still have to survive senior year .
and i can &apos;t do it alone .
we need your help , mona ,
but this doesn &apos;t suddenly make us besties .
i don &apos;t want to hold your hand in the hallways , emily .
no one can know that i &apos;m doing this
or the deal is off .
and that includes your bed @-@ buddies .
okay ?
so do whatever you were going to do today .
just act normal .
hey , toodles .
happy almost @-@ turkey day .
thanks .
you ready for thanksgiving ?
uh , not really , no .
because we usually decorate early for christmas
and this year , i &apos;m totally behind .
if you need any help ...
how was your night , the one you got all dressed up for ?
it was a costume thing .
mine didn &apos;t really fit .
we never had our talk .
i &apos;m tired of talking .
mom ?
what are you doing here ?
i was just in the cafeteria
dropping off the food for the holiday drive .
you forgot to bring the bag this morning .
sorry , my brain &apos;s already on thanksgiving break .
it &apos;s no big deal .
don &apos;t be late for class , honey .
i &apos;ll see you tonight .
yeah .
alison dilaurentis ,
please report to principal hackett &apos;s office .
alison dilaurentis ,
please report to the principal .
you got pumpkin guts on your face .
come here .
thank you .
you know , we can just go to paula &apos;s and buy the pies .
no , this is my grandmother &apos;s recipe .
this is way better than paula &apos;s .
granny rose uses libby &apos;s canned pie mix
and puts it in a frozen shell ,
but montgomerys will never know the difference .
well , this is the first time the montgomerys
have invited me over for thanksgiving .
and your mother assigned me to the pie duty .
so i &apos;m not taking it lightly .
well , just so you know ,
they &apos;re not gonna have enough time to judge your baking .
they &apos;ll be too busy judging you .
well , that &apos;s why you &apos;re invited .
they know that we &apos;re spending a lot of time together ,
so they just want to make sure
that you &apos;re worth a second look .
i &apos;m suddenly feeling like a used car .
are they going to kick my tires and check under my hood ?
well , if aunt sarah gets drunk ,
she might check under your hood .
and uncle danny will ask you to arm wrestle .
just say no .
you &apos;re gonna love granny , though .
you can get past the long chin hairs .
you won &apos;t mind that she toots a lot .
i &apos;m joking .
granny plucks her chin hairs .
put your hands behind your head and turn around .
i said put your hands behind your head .
i &apos;m sorry , officer ,
i have a difficult time with authority .
if you want me to put my hands behind my head ,
you &apos;re gonna have to come over here and make me .
are you looking for trouble ?
no , sir .
i &apos;m a good girl , honest .
i just have a lot of really bad habits .
oh , yeah .
they taught us how to deal
with delinquents like you in the academy .
why don &apos;t you show me what you learned ?
that is some cop scholl .
you &apos;ll see it tonight .
the ceremony starts at 8 : 00,
but i think we should leave the brew by 7 : 00 .
i &apos;ll be on time , i promise .
happy graduation .
open it .
go ahead , open it .
spence .
i love you .
sorry to bother you .
is this where i apply
for the high school liaison program ?
oh , yeah .
have a seat .
i &apos;ll get you pplication
em , when mona said act normal ,
i don &apos;t think she meant we had to decorate your house .
this is the one thing i do every year
for me and my family .
i &apos;m not gonna let ali take that away from me .
eggnog ?
no , thanks .
if you can &apos;t find christmas in your heart , hanna ,
you &apos;re not gonna find it under a tree .
hey , em , is this right ?
a little more to the right .
no , my right , not snowey &apos;s right .
snowey ?
yeah , i named him when i was three .
and this is pingey and wingey .
which one did you touch ?
all of them , i don &apos;t know .
oh , try one of the red ones .
they always go out .
told you .
now let &apos;s deck the halls and fa la la la la .
what is wrong with her ?
read her boobs .
the girl loves christmas .
where &apos;s jesus ?
he &apos;s up here .
it &apos;s my mom .
you guys really go all out .
my dad always finds a way to come home for christmas .
it &apos;s after thanksgiving dinner my mom and i come outside ,
turn on the lights
and we know it won &apos;t be long until we see him .
well , now i know why you love christmas .
uh , how &apos;s everything at home ?
good .
she just needs cranberries .
they were on the list .
they should be in the fridge .
yeah , i know , but my grandma likes the canned kind .
you know , the ones that you slice .
i thought your grandma always made that salad
with the cranberries and the marshmallows in it .
or not .
hey , em , can you grab a staple gun and give me a hand ?
okay , what was that ?
what was what ?
hanna , i know when you &apos;re lying to me .
who else was in the barn that night ?
aria montgomery .
hanna marin .
and emily fields .
when you left the barn ,
they were all still sleeping ?
yes .
where did you last see spencer hastings ?
she came to my house .
you were the leader of the group , right ?
unofficially .
and your friends would have done anything to help you ?
if you needed them ?
i think so .
was spencer a loyal friend ?
as far as i knew .
why was she at your house ?
it was my fault .
i pushed her to that place .
what place ?
she was angry .
did you know spencer was abusing amphetamines ?
i found out that night .
because she was under the influence ?
she dropped her pills .
i saw what they were .
would you say she was desperate ?
for what ?
for you to keep her secret ?
she was emotional .
but i promised her i wouldn &apos;t say anything .
and in return for your silence ,
what was she willing to do ?
i wouldn &apos;t know .
we never discussed it again .
is there something else you &apos;d like to tell me ?
i didn &apos;t have anything to do with bethany young &apos;s murder .
do you play ?
sorry ?
the piano ?
i loved it as a kid , but i lost interest .
i can &apos;t remember why .
i shouldn &apos;t be here without lieutenant tanner ,
but i just wanted to tell you this in person .
what is it ?
nothing ali said was really that incriminating .
i think the questions they &apos;re asking
tell us more about their investigation
than her answers do .
how so ?
was spencer a loyal friend ?
was she desperate ?
desperate enough to do what ?
kill bethany .
caleb , you are supposed to keep that secret .
mona came to me .
i knew you &apos;d tell him , so i asked for his help .
are there any other helpers coming ?
no , i didn &apos;t tell my bed @-@ buddy .
neither did i.
i &apos;m sorry .
but could you lie to that face ?
i unlocked two more files .
your software slays by the way .
is that decoding program military ?
you don &apos;t want to know .
the cops were granted access
to bethany &apos;s radley files yesterday .
i can &apos;t open that link ,
but i did find this affidavit
that holbrook sent to the da today .
&quot; we no longer consider alison dilaurentis
a person of interest in young &apos;s murder investigation . &quot;
so she &apos;s totally off the hook ?
yeah , and spencer &apos;s on it .
&quot; the information we obtained
from bethany young &apos;s hospital records
inform the theory we &apos;ve been working since day one .
spencer hastings murdered young to gain favor
with the group &apos;s leader , alison . &quot;
but why would killing bethany score points with ali ?
she told them she knew that i was taking the pills .
so they think that i would have done anything
to make her keep it a secret .
yeah , but why would they think that she wanted bethany dead ?
you said he sent this to the da ?
guys , i know how this works .
they submit an affidavit
so they can issue an arrest warrant .
can you please call toby ?
i have to find my parents .
before you do that ,
don &apos;t you want to know what the cops know ?
that affidavit was sent the day
after they saw bethany &apos;s radley files .
there has to be something in those files
that linked ali to bethany .
let &apos;s find out what that is .
you guys , this is on me .
you don &apos;t have to do anything else .
come on , spence .
we &apos;re gonna stick together .
yeah , because that &apos;s what we do .
let &apos;s go back to radley .
together .
are you in ?
we &apos;re in .
code &quot; go . &quot;
i repeat , code &quot; go . &quot;
good night .
emily hasn &apos;t checked in .
you better make sure that &apos;s not from &quot; a. &quot;
you mean alison .
it &apos;s toby .
i should have told him what we were doing .
not to poke where i don &apos;t belong ,
but if i were graduating from po @-@ po school ,
i wouldn &apos;t want to know that my girlfriend
just broke into radley .
i have to make it to that ceremony .
then let &apos;s stop chatting and hthu .
we &apos;re in the east corridor hall approaching the security door .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s nothing .
just a scratchy throat .
but i was just about to crawl into bed , so ...
i will .
thanks , paige .
emily .
i didn &apos;t mean to scare you .
no , you didn &apos;t .
i seriously saw the hair rise on the back of your neck
when you heard my voice .
i was surprised to get your message .
you made your feelings for me
crystal the last time i saw you .
sorry , my mom is at the store .
last minute shopping .
在我身边 好讨厌
why am i here , emily ?
it bothers me .
i mean tomorrow &apos;s thanksgiving and you and i aren &apos;t speaking .
i wasn &apos;t that surprised when the others turned on me .
you were the one i really trusted .
the loyal one .
what ?
nothing .
i &apos;m sorry i disappointed you .
ali , wait .
i don &apos;t want things to be like this .
neither do i.
wow , that &apos;s beautiful , sandy .
i love the colors that you chose .
i &apos;m so sorry .
this was totally all my fault .
yeah , my middle name should have been klutz .
thank you .
and can you believe
i actually wanted to be a dancer growing up ?
but then i realized i was on the shorter side ,
so career crisis averted .
hey , i &apos;m sorry .
we &apos;ve got company .
h , use your codes please .
seriously ?
okay , red @-@ light . do you hear me ?
we &apos;re in .
i said red @-@ light as in the cherry on top of a cop car .
you &apos;ve made quite a mess of things .
i didn &apos;t know you worked here , aria .
it &apos;s not a job .
i volunteer .
it &apos;s admirable .
okay , well , i should probably get back to the patients .
they might need more supplies .
yeah , of course .
i &apos;m just curious .
when did it all start ?
what ?
the lies .
the cover @-@ ups .
the murders .
your volunteer program .
a few weeks ago .
do you have an interest in the mental health profession ?
well , i love art , i love helping people .
and did you volunteer before
or after the police identified bethany &apos;s body ?
okay , you don &apos;t sound just curious anymore .
should i call my parents ?
no . not yet .
one last thing .
was your volunteer work spencer &apos;s idea ?
no .
em , is me .
i mean , &quot; h. &quot;
is she still there ?
because holbrook &apos;s here and it &apos;s getting weird .
what is this ?
that ?
stop stalling .
well , obviously it &apos;s a list of colleges .
right , but this is a list of schools
that normally brainiacs go to .
yeah , so ?
you know that test they make you take ?
the sct ?
you mean the sat ?
i don &apos;t remember which one it was .
but apparently i did kind of good on it .
well , how good is kind of good ?
good enough that the guidance counselor called me in for cheating .
but i didn &apos;t cheat .
there &apos;s no way they &apos;re going to let you be friends with me .
if that &apos;s what you want .
i make my own decisions .
it &apos;s not a group vote .
i &apos;ve had the chills all day .
do you have any tea ?
chamomile ?
your mom never shops at the last minute .
you &apos;ve got a text from hanna .
she wants to know if you &apos;re still keeping me busy .
i &apos;m &quot; a , &quot; right ?
i don &apos;t know .
are you ?
i actually believed you .
it must hurt when the loyal one betrays you .
that was quite a performance , em .
bravo .
it looks like they recorded every one of bethany &apos;s sessions .
so what are your choices ?
yale , harvard , and dartmouth .
you got early acceptance from all three ?
brown , too ,
but they &apos;re not offering me a full ride , so i &apos;m passing .
how about you ?
i haven &apos;t heard from anyone yet .
well , if there &apos;s anything i can do to help ...
i think you &apos;ve done enough .
wait , are we stealing this stuff ?
we &apos;re borrowing it .
wait .
see if there is a tape for august 8th ?
i thought she really liked me .
but everything she ever said to me was a lie .
who is she talking about ?
every word .
every visit .
mrs. dilaurentis .
she was having an affair with bethany &apos;s father .
i wonder if i can trust anyone in that family .
is it like mother , like daughter ?
oh , my god .
did alison know bethany ?
spencer , it &apos;s me .
i can &apos;t wait any longer , so i &apos;m gonna head out .
call me .
we need to find another way out of here .
use the back staircase .
we can trip the emergency exit .
what &apos;s holbrook doing here ?
asking questions about spencer .
toby , hi .
spencer , where are you ?
i was worried about you .
wait , i can &apos;t hear you .
hello ?
spencer ?
spencer ?
i can &apos;t hear you .
toby !
i can &apos;t believe they make you work on thanksgiving .
i get off at noon .
people still need their fix .
thanks .
spencer , it &apos;s not your fault .
were you at the hospital all night ?
yeah .
he &apos;s going to be fine . you said so yourself .
he &apos;s gonna be in that cast for about a month .
how much does he know ?
everything .
emily , i have to talk to you .
paige , i &apos;m sorry , now is not a good time .
i brought you some soup last night
because you said you weren &apos;t feeling well .
yeah , and i lied because ...
explain it to me later .
i saw alison leaving .
cindy and mindy were her ride .
they drove her out to this abandoned farm .
there had to have been at least a dozen cars out there .
guys , ali is building an army of her own .
spencer hastings , you &apos;re under arrest
for the murder of bethany young .
no . i @-@ i @-@ i didn &apos;t do this .
... will be admissible in a court of law .
she didn &apos;t do anything ! - she can &apos;t do anything !
guys !
spencer !
toby .
i &apos;ll call your parents .
we &apos;ll get you out .
i thought she really liked me .
but everything she ever said to me was a lie .
mona ?
i &apos;ll be right down .
and did i tell you lesli &apos;s gonna be there ?
no way . i talked to her last night .
she said she was stuck at school .
pretend i didn &apos;t just ruin the surprise .
promise me you &apos;ll get on the road within the hour .
i don &apos;t want you to get stuck in traffic .
okay , i will .
i just have to finish this report
and then i &apos;m on my way .
i know we don &apos;t need these .
but i figured someone might get hungry .
my mom &apos;s still on the phone with veronica .
they haven &apos;t seen her yet .
spencer &apos;s still getting processed .
look , i &apos;m sure that the hastings are working on her bail .
they &apos;ll get her out of there in no time , aria .
it &apos;s mona .
hello .
alison lured bethany to rosewood .
what ? why ?
she knew about the affair .
alison set her up .
she was jealous and she wanted bethany dead .
aria , alison is &quot; a &quot;
and now i can prove it .
grab your coat .
where are we going ?
to mona &apos;s . she found proof .
ali &apos;s &quot; a. &quot;
game over , alison .
i win .
mom ?
mona ?
what the hell ?
oh , my god .
mona !
call 911 .
oh my god !
hurry !
the investigation is ongoing ,
but we have ruled this a homicide .
although we did not find a body ,
the amount of blood in the house would indicate
that the victim &apos;s wounds were fatal .
mona vanderwaal was murdered .
no , no , no .
