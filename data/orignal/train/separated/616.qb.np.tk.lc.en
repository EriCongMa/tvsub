another shooting incident has taken
two young lives here in the city .
the same unusual high @-@ tech assault weapon used today
has also been traced to a series of homicides ,
which have occurred over the past few weeks .
it is believed at this time that the crimes were committed
by one particular gang , but ...
punisher !
how the hell did you get all these weapons , cain ?
your mouth seems to be working just fine .
you sadistic freak !
i &apos;m waiting . answer me .
evening , castle . what have you got there ?
friend of yours ?
what are you doing here , black widow ?
stay out of my way .
director fury says he &apos;d like to have a word with you .
then he should get on a shuttle and come down here .
i &apos;m in the middle of working .
you know this was a s.h.i.e.l.d. op . we had our eyes on them .
so did i.
thanks to you , this operation has been compromised .
what you &apos;re doing is going to cause them to pull back
and make it more difficult for us to track and identify the supplier .
you play your games , i stop these scum .
no court or prison , just a bullet .
you &apos;re so shortsighted , castle . open your eyes .
don &apos;t you think you &apos;ve done enough for today ?
now hand cain over .
forget it .
i &apos;ll say this for a second time . so listen , black widow .
stay out of my way .
i won &apos;t warn you again .
last chance , hand him over .
you get no third warning .
frank !
frank ...
i only need a minute . and it &apos;s very important .
i presume it &apos;s something important to you .
is that right , fury ?
or should i be addressing you as director fury ?
we go back a long way ...
well then , director fury ,
you should know that i &apos;ll do anything to get the job done .
oh , i &apos;m aware of that .
you haven &apos;t got a clue .
if you did , then you would have brought along more men .
if you really want to talk , then tell your toy soldiers to stand down .
widow ...
i know how his mind works .
and he won &apos;t forget that .
too much talking . and anyway , he was threatening you .
frank had no intention of hurting me , you know that .
can &apos;t be too safe .
tie him up and take him to the holding cell on the helicarrier .
as for cain ...
boss , i think
that may present a problem .
so , you &apos;re finally up . how about a hot cup of coffee ?
about time . got a headache ?
come on , frank . you used to smile more , back in the old days .
yeah . a lifetime ago .
look at what you &apos;ve become .
a self @-@ appointed judge , jury , and executioner .
you think you &apos;re above the law .
you and that damned skull .
no question you &apos;re effective , but there are rules we have to follow .
it isn &apos;t the wild west out there .
not even for you .
as long as you were attacking low @-@ level thugs ,
i had no problem with your methods , and let you run free .
but this time , i can &apos;t look the other way .
you &apos;ve stepped into my territory .
i do what i have to do , that &apos;s all .
come on !
this is a much bigger operation than you could ever imagine !
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here in cuffs !
i can &apos;t have you getting in the way and screwing things up !
it costs too much time and money !
it &apos;s your operation ?
and just how many people do you think died
while you wasted all that time and money ?
beyond that , how many innocent lives
are you willing to let be ruined
while you play things by the book ?
kids died while you were following the rules with your operation .
you &apos;re not stupid , frank , so don &apos;t be so damn shortsighted .
you want to win the battle . i want to win the whole war .
you s.h.i.e.l.d. suits are so concerned with the war ,
you forget about all the people
who get caught in the crossfire .
who cares if you win , if there &apos;s no one left alive to celebrate ?
we care that the bad guys need to be stopped .
we &apos;re on the same page in that regard .
to do that , though ,
we have to destroy the root of the problem , not the tip of the branch .
if we don &apos;t eliminate the network ,
the whole thing is nothing but an exercise in futility .
and the network is ...
leviathan .
you want to know who &apos;s to blame ? they &apos;re the ones .
they &apos;re the terrorist group responsible
for the high @-@ tech specialized assault weapons flooding your streets .
our biggest concern at the moment
is that somehow they &apos;ve acquired
s.h.i.e.l.d. &apos; s proprietary weapons technology .
and they &apos;ve now begun using it against us .
we know this because the weapon &apos;s operating system is based
on a unique technology we &apos;ve spent years developing .
as you can see ,
the high @-@ density laser is concentrated into plasma ,
which energizes the wakefield , controlling its emission .
since the technology was created by s.h.i.e.l.d. ,
the truth of the matter is , you people have blood on your hands , as well .
what are you gonna do , castle , come after all of s.h.i.e.l.d. ?
i &apos;d like to see that .
we have been a step behind .
we needed to track down and neutralize the manufacturer of the guns ,
to prevent our technology from being used for terrorism .
and cain was going to lead us to them .
okay , then , so what &apos;s the problem ?
we &apos;ve run into an unexpected development .
cain got away from us .
it happened when we were busy dealing with you .
what was it that cain told you ?
not a thing .
yeah , i &apos;m not buying that .
we think he told you the location of the guns .
we need that intel .
i have no intention of becoming your informant , nick .
well , if he did tell you where to find them ,
why not cooperate with us ?
take this thing off first .
you can &apos;t make demands .
if you refuse to cooperate with us , we &apos;ll lock you up .
i have one condition before i &apos;ll say anything .
do you really think you &apos;re in a position to make a deal ?
let me go after them .
why would i allow that ?
isn &apos;t that really why you brought me in here ?
well , i &apos;m not gonna play along , unless you remove these now !
you should just give him what he wants , director .
the truth is we &apos;re on a clock here and there &apos;s no time to waste .
yeah , i know .
all right , we met your conditions .
tell us the location cain gave you .
if you provide me with some weapons , i &apos;ll go in alone .
at first , you only gave one condition . to let you go .
here &apos;s my condition . from now on , you take orders from me .
it &apos;s easier if you stay out of it .
unfortunately , i can &apos;t allow that .
you &apos;ll have to adjust to having a new partner .
i hope you can keep up .
we may be working together ,
but i &apos;m not taking orders from you .
tell me what you know about leviathan .
didn &apos;t you read the brief ? it was all in there .
it wasn &apos;t very insightful . mostly bureaucratic nonsense .
leviathan is a terrorist organization
that was formerly a secret division
of russian intelligence .
does that mean you know some of the players ?
only by reputation .
when russia collapsed , they all went underground
they expanded their power by basing themselves in economically poor regions
that had been devastated by recurring wars .
they &apos;re involved with every evil deed known to man .
human trafficking , assassination , terrorism , drugs , you name it .
they don &apos;t claim responsibility for their crimes ,
and the objective of the organization is unknown .
that makes them both terrifying and dangerous .
and with the technology s.h.i.e.l.d. has provided them ,
they &apos;ve now become lethal .
the most lethal crime organization anywhere in the world .
we didn &apos;t provide it to them . they stole it from us .
that doesn &apos;t make a difference to the dead civilians .
the site down there used to be a center
for biological weapons research .
they had an accident 20 years ago and shut down .
their existence was completely erased from all records .
we &apos;ll make our move when it gets dark .
the more time we waste , the more victims there are going to be .
what the hell ?
are they all dead ?
no , they &apos;re alive .
at least , i think .
you need to forget about cain for now .
we have our orders .
we need to get the info and then get the hell out of here .
not me .
castle ! what do you think you &apos;re doing here ?
don &apos;t forget , you agreed to cooperate .
i showed you cain &apos;s location .
castle !
my cooperation ends here and now .
i &apos;m not gonna let you go rogue on us .
damn it !
i &apos;m not letting that lowlife thug get away with this .
he &apos;s the one who provided the guns that tore up my streets .
and because of that ,
there &apos;s a whole lot of innocent people who didn &apos;t make it out alive .
i can &apos;t let you blow this .
this is ridiculous . we shouldn &apos;t be fighting .
then just back off and let me do things my way .
you should know by now , i don &apos;t play by your rules .
you and fury need to clean up your own mess .
yeah , right , frank .
damn it !
punisher !
all right then . now that you &apos;ve slept ,
you should be able to think straight .
who were the humans in those pods ?
why the hell are you here ?
i &apos;m asking the questions .
orion will never allow you to leave here alive !
you &apos;ll die a horrible death .
now that &apos;s a shame .
too bad you won &apos;t be around to see it .
unless , of course , you answer my questions .
okay , okay ! just put that thing down !
tasha .
elihas !
is it you ?
but how ?
you were ...
should be dead !
i &apos;m sorry , tasha .
i didn &apos;t want this to be the way ... the way to tell you .
bastard !
natasha ...
it is you .
you are , or were , a s.h.i.e.l.d. agent , elihas .
but now you &apos;re working for leviathan ?
and worse than that ,
you &apos;re providing them with weapons ?
you traitor !
tasha . listen .
i was given an opportunity to step up and be better than i was .
to be more than a s.h.i.e.l.d. scientist .
i had the chance to have real power , to be a warrior !
and why would that matter in the end ?
i &apos;d be someone who &apos;s finally worthy of your love .
why wouldn &apos;t you think you &apos;re worthy ?
you &apos;re one of the greatest spies in the world .
and you &apos;re a superhero on top of it !
in the end , a normal man couldn &apos;t keep up with you .
you &apos;re an avenger . you were always running off to save the world .
you didn &apos;t know , but all that time i was at s.h.i.e.l.d. ,
i was never really sure where i stood with you .
because you didn &apos;t have power ,
you doubted my feelings for you ?
it wasn &apos;t so much that i doubted your feelings .
but when you think about it , honestly examine it ,
you always chose missions
and the avengers over me .
i just wasn &apos;t good enough .
elihas , you &apos;re wrong .
tasha ... let &apos;s work together again , you and i.
you would be perfect ! let me talk to orion !
is he the one who &apos;s in charge here ?
he heads up this cell , but more than that ,
he &apos;s very highly placed in the organization .
you think you can convince him to take me on ?
i &apos;m sure of it . they trust me .
natasha ...
i want you to stay and witness the new me .
before i give you an answer ,
tell me about the pods , the people in them .
they &apos;re the best spies we could find , recruited by orion .
recruited ?
don &apos;t you really mean &quot; abducted &quot; ?
some , maybe , but it &apos;s in the service of a greater good .
they &apos;re the vanguard of a new world ! when they wake up ,
they &apos;ll be transformed into living weapons .
they won &apos;t fear death .
these men , they will have super powers of their own ,
able to conquer any enemy .
super @-@ powered soldiers at your command . is that right ?
what have you done , elihas ?
i &apos;m the one who made all this possible .
the serum for strengthening the body ,
the reconditioning technology ...
i developed the whole thing !
all this for leviathan ?
you can see how effective it is
by looking at me .
to make sure it worked , i tested it on myself .
where are these soldiers to be deployed ?
everywhere . anywhere in the world , anytime they may be needed !
so you &apos;re going to go out and sell them ?
we &apos;ll sell to the highest bidder .
if two countries are at war , we &apos;ll sell to both sides of the conflict !
that just means there &apos;ll be more death wherever leviathan goes .
business is business .
if we don &apos;t supply the weapons , someone else will .
i just want them to continue funding my research .
i &apos;m not the boring lab @-@ drone i was when i was at s.h.i.e.l.d.
i made use of advanced technology !
i transcended artificial boundaries .
i turned myself into something better ,
someone who is finally worthy to stand by you .
will you stay with me ?
i didn &apos;t want to do this . however , you leave me no choice
but to take you down !
in reality , s.h.i.e.l.d. is nothing more
than an organization that uses fear to keep people down .
we give people a chance to fight back !
is that what your boss says to justify all of this ?
now is the time to see that you &apos;ve made
a big mistake !
sorry , but you &apos;re the one who needs to see , natasha !
did you find what you were looking for ?
i was interrupted .
and , what about you ?
it &apos;s no use .
it &apos;s cain &apos;s cell phone .
there has to be something there .
the equipment we &apos;re using isn &apos;t powerful enough .
i need this tomorrow . huh ?
what &apos;s he doing here ?
you &apos;re pretty popular .
marine corps , huh ?
amadeus !
i wasn &apos;t aware s.h.i.e.l.d. allowed pets .
geniuses tend to get special treatment .
wake up . i need you .
oh , hello there , agent romanoff .
it &apos;s been a while . but you &apos;re still as pretty as ever .
yeah , save the flattery .
why are you here today ? you want to continue our chess match ?
sure , if you want .
so , knight to f @-@ 6 .
i &apos;ll go queen f @-@ 7 ! and that &apos;s a checkmate !
well , i guess you win again .
i can &apos;t seem to beat you when it comes to games .
no kidding ! i &apos;ll give you some tips , though ,
so you can compete better next time .
i can teach you how to transmit
my genius brain impulses to your nerve cells !
it &apos;s my current research .
it works by intercepting the chemical
synapse in the brain before fusing with the ...
a word of advice . keep talking like that ,
and girls will avoid you like the plague !
i &apos;m still not experienced enough in that department .
i &apos;ve got an idea ! how about a date to teach me !
i &apos;ll think about it .
but really , we should save the world first .
darn it !
agent romanoff .
could that man standing right there be the punisher ?
frank castle , meet amadeus cho .
he &apos;s young , but he &apos;s the most talented scientist at s.h.i.e.l.d.
young , you say ? this kid looks like a third @-@ grader .
i have a very important job for you , amadeus .
you &apos;ve got 10 minutes to decrypt all the data off this device .
listen , i have low blood pressure .
and i don &apos;t work well right after i wake up .
too bad . i had something special in mind as a reward ...
hey , i &apos;m feeling a lot better now !
my blood pressure and heart rate are almost normal !
mmm ...
it looks like a regular smartphone ,
but there &apos;s some pretty sophisticated software installed on it .
and there are several layers of security locks to keep out the looky @-@ loos .
i thought as much . that &apos;s why i came to you .
you can do it , can &apos;t you ?
that depends .
how long are you giving me ? ten minutes ?
if i go faster , can i get a kiss ?
you &apos;re a real smart @-@ ass .
you &apos;re the one getting all the kisses .
kirby &apos;s a kisser , that &apos;s for sure .
mmm ...
that &apos;s kind of weird ...
what &apos;s wrong ?
hope i didn &apos;t cause that .
that doesn &apos;t look very good to me .
yeah . i think i might have turned something on .
really ? like what ?
can you add more time to the challenge ?
i still kind of want that kiss .
castle ...
castle ! what &apos;s wrong ?
turn that thing off !
shut it down , amadeus !
i can &apos;t ! i think it &apos;s gonna ...
oh , no ! oh , no !
it &apos;s gonna explode !
hurry ! or else he &apos;s gonna kill us all !
oh , brother ! i &apos;ll never make it !
even tony stark couldn &apos;t pull this off !
if this lab explodes ,
you can forget that kiss !
don &apos;t panic ! i &apos;ll figure it out !
castle , you &apos;ve gotta snap out of it !
time for plan b !
did i do all this ?
oh , yeah . big time .
i don &apos;t know how leviathan pulled it off ,
but somehow you were being controlled the whole way .
hold on . i want everyone to back off and stand down .
he was being controlled .
but he &apos;s fine now . let me talk to him .
there &apos;s nothing to talk about .
castle ...
sorry .
elihas told me he had developed
a brainwashing technology he was using
to control the leviathan soldiers .
i think the same thing was used on castle .
he didn &apos;t know what he was doing .
you may be right .
that &apos;s to be decided after the investigation .
but right now , i &apos;m being pressured to lock him up for life
and throw away the key .
i admit that what he did was awful , but you have to remember ,
he wasn &apos;t in his right mind .
just a minute . since when did you become frank castle &apos;s best friend ?
i &apos;m just saying ... he &apos;s not all bad .
we broke the code on that device . we now have a lead .
and we need to launch an alpha strike as soon as possible .
and we need to do it before the bio @-@ enhanced soldiers of leviathan
get scattered throughout the world .
from what we &apos;ve seen so far , leviathan &apos;s
brainwashing technology is very powerful .
it can turn anyone into a living weapon .
if that &apos;s the case , we can &apos;t dispatch the avengers .
that &apos;s why i decided to put you in charge of this mission .
i see . so you knew about the technology ?
that they could brainwash anyone ?
we weren &apos;t absolutely sure of that .
there &apos;s the possibility that some past s.h.i.e.l.d. projects
could have been compromised . some that couldn &apos;t be implemented ,
which were then canceled , apparently fell into the hands of leviathan .
among those projects was one that centered on mind @-@ control research .
that &apos;s why you assigned me and punisher ,
for the same reason ?
that &apos;s right . even if one or both of you ended up getting brainwashed ,
we &apos;d be able to deal with it .
unlike the others .
protecting your ass ?
i can &apos;t really deny that .
sending people on a mission without full intel
is just idiotic .
i decide how much information you need to carry out the mission .
like knowing whether or not you &apos;d cut me loose if i got brainwashed ?
look , natasha ...
give me all the information you have pertaining to this operation .
if you don &apos;t , some crazy brainwashed
female agent might just come after you .
i take it you knew about elihas ?
i know this has to be hard for you . but listen ...
never mind . among the long list of unanswered questions ,
at least we know where leviathan got our technology .
but there is one mystery ...
yes . how did he create the bio @-@ enhanced soldiers ?
elihas told me he came up with a serum
that enhances physical strength .
that makes sense . we know he stole
some classified data before he supposedly died .
that &apos;s right .
since he was dead ,
we closed the case and didn &apos;t bother trying to follow up on it .
but in a later inventory ,
we discovered he had taken some very important material with him .
and what would that have been ?
we &apos;re always trying to protect our people
from catastrophic injuries .
we have dna and blood reserves for every agent ,
in case an emergency occurs during the course of a mission .
part of that stock went missing .
then that means those soldiers ...
super @-@ powered soldiers at your command . is that right ?
what have you done , elihas ?
i &apos;m the one who made all this possible .
the serum for strengthening the body ,
the reconditioning technology ...
i developed the whole thing !
there &apos;s no time for these feelings , natasha .
i need you to keep your head in the game .
it &apos;s extremely critical that you remain focused on your mission .
continue your operation to track leviathan ,
decipher the brainwashing technology ,
and destroy the bio @-@ enhanced soldiers they &apos;ve created .
what am i supposed to do about my partner ?
you don &apos;t have a partner anymore .
elihas , you are on the verge of bringing us all down .
what have you done ?
did i hurt you ?
i &apos;m fine . i can still spew out insults .
what did fury say ?
people want to put you away , for life .
no less than i deserve .
when my family was murdered in front of me ,
i made myself into a weapon of single @-@ minded destruction .
i needed revenge , and i took it !
but look at me now .
i killed three innocent people in the process .
i can &apos;t be trusted out there on my own .
i could be turned at any moment .
that makes me nothing but a liability to the world at large .
and for that , i need to be punished .
before you get your 30 lashes , scores needs settling .
i &apos;m gonna do this my way !
that &apos;s fine .
try not to interfere , as i do things my way .
i &apos;ve only met ren once before .
he makes a business providing information to people
regarding the ins and outs of the underworld
for a large sum of money .
i found out about cain through him .
you paid him , did you ?
i guess you &apos;ll be paying for this lead , as well .
how cute .
he owes me .
so no money will be needed .
owes you for what ?
a while back , he contacted me .
his daughter had been kidnapped and murdered .
it took me a while , but i finally found the murderer
and got rid of him .
hello there , frank ! how nice to see you again !
almost as pretty as me , when i was young .
hello , frank !
leviathan , huh ?
i didn &apos;t know cain and his men were
associated with those traffickers .
well , they are .
and i figure the leviathan auction will be held anytime .
tell me where and when .
it &apos;s the leviathan auction .
come on , don &apos;t tell me you haven &apos;t heard of it .
ren !
it &apos;s too risky , frank .
if they found out i leaked the information , my life would be over .
i have to be careful where i step .
i still have two daughters .
if the weapons start circulating , a lot of innocent people ,
just like your daughters , could be killed .
the whole thing is true .
there is going to be a massive auction held by leviathan .
tell us where .
it &apos;ll be in madripoor .
madripoor , you say ?
my favorite place .
makes sense , it &apos;s a haven for criminals .
from what i understand , this auction is drawing particular attention
because their newest weapon is rumored to be on the block .
there will be no shortage of buyers bidding for it .
when is it ? it &apos;s tonight . at 2 : 00 a.m.
we &apos;ll be there .
heads up , you two . this piece just ran on the news .
we have footage of the shootings and explosions
that took place in the center of dubai today ...
leviathan &apos;s enhanced soldiers .
they &apos;re known as bio @-@ soldiers within the organization .
this is just in to our newsroom .
squads of soldiers are on the scene ...
a little demonstration of their product , i see .
get going . there &apos;s no time left .
we &apos;ll be feet @-@ dry in five minutes .
we should reach madripoor soon .
proceed with extreme caution .
and don &apos;t forget , at some point you &apos;ll have
to explain how your partner got out of the brig .
i don &apos;t have a partner , remember ?
there &apos;s no way to break the brainwashing .
don &apos;t worry about it .
open the tactical link !
we &apos;re about to commence alpha @-@ strike !
director .
call from tony stark .
thank you all for coming .
i hope you &apos;re enjoying the entertainment . we spared no expense .
today , i have the pleasure of welcoming
the most influential men in the world ,
all of whom have gathered here at my request ,
in anticipation of seeing something truly unique .
gentlemen , beneath your feet
stands the pride of our advanced technology .
think about it . you can program your own super @-@ powered army .
never fear s.h.i.e.l.d. or the avengers again !
take a look at the bio @-@ soldiers of leviathan !
they &apos;re here .
punisher and black widow .
and the avengers ? negative , sir .
on your right ...
i see what you mean , natasha .
it looks like we &apos;re the prey here .
you were saying ?
frank ! don &apos;t kill them !
i have no choice !
they were all originally
innocent civilians , you know .
now they &apos;re just killing machines .
don &apos;t forget one thing .
they were all dragged into this !
the same way your family was !
i &apos;m sorry , frank .
i invited some of my friends to the party .
i hope that &apos;s okay .
elihas !
close your eyes !
what the hell ?
maybe he doesn &apos;t have a brain to wash !
sorry to make you wait . i brought you something .
you need to hold it up against your eyes .
amadeus !
i &apos;m telling you , this guy is harder to ride than a horse .
shows you what a guy will do to get a kiss .
this coats your pupils with a nano @-@ device
that won &apos;t accept the brainwashing signals they &apos;re broadcasting .
good work .
thanks !
go get him . he &apos;s all yours , widow .
so , i see everything &apos;s going well with your new partner !
i hope you &apos;re happy together !
i did this ,
all of this , just for you !
and now after all this , you turn your back on me !
why ?
i sacrificed everything ,
everything i &apos;d worked so hard for .
just to obtain this power that we could share together !
that &apos;s all i ever wanted .
i wanted to spend the rest of my life with you !
but i wanted to spend that life as an equal , worthy of your love !
what was wrong with that ? was it too much to ask ?
what was wrong with that ?
you &apos;re insane !
oh , elihas ... you didn &apos;t think
i loved you just the way you were ?
did you really think so little of me ?
of yourself ? of us ?
you did this all for me ?
how dare you ?
how dare you make me responsible for all your crimes ?
then why ?
what did i do all of this for ?
why did i do this ?
i never intended to hurt you , tasha .
elihas ...
can you see that ?
i just wanted to be the kind of man who deserved your love !
that &apos;s all ...
that &apos;s all i wanted !
you never had to earn my love .
you had it by being yourself .
how did this all go so wrong ?
i always respected you for the man you were .
and that was enough .
the elihas starr that i always loved
didn &apos;t need any special powers .
he just needed to be there , right by my side .
you were so precious to me .
but i always agonized
that i wasn &apos;t enough for you .
i never realized that you were in such pain .
i &apos;m sorry , elihas .
have i made a terrible mistake ?
do you remember what you told me once , a long time ago ?
that more than anything , you wanted to be a hero for me ?
it &apos;s not about power .
it &apos;s about always trying to do the right thing ,
no matter how challenging that might be at the time .
you know ?
and now i &apos;ve failed that challenge .
right ?
i still believe in you , elihas .
there &apos;s a kill switch for emergencies .
in case a security exploit appeared
in the brainwashing program of the bio @-@ soldiers .
it &apos;s there to prevent third parties from controlling them .
or worse , in the event the buyers decided
to burn all evidence of the transaction ,
and mobilize the bio @-@ soldier forces against leviathan itself .
it was a hidden safety valve .
orion , who is in the auction room , has that switch .
but you can &apos;t just charge in .
all the buyers and their security teams are there , as well .
sounds fun .
would you be willing to work with me for old times &apos; sake ?
iron man has arrived . please , hold your applause .
what makes you think anybody cares , stark ?
what an explosive reception . we must be at the right place .
i hope we &apos;re not overdressed !
oh , man ! are we late ?
try not to get yourself killed , all right ?
aw ! i lost the best seat in the house ! whoa !
hey , frank . that makes us even for karachi !
nice to see you &apos;re still as pleasant as you ever were .
and it &apos;s just as nice to see that you &apos;re still bulletproof , stark .
oh , boy .
phew !
yeah , i thought that might happen .
so i brought your biggest fan .
hulk hate graviton !
all right , phase one complete .
now , why won &apos;t orion come out to play ?
what is the meaning of this ,
elihas ?
really . is that the best you can do ?
stop it , orion !
i am not gonna let you do this !
do you hear me ?
i &apos;m going to protect
those who are important to me !
the fact of the matter is , you &apos;re too late .
our plans are so far advanced ,
there &apos;s no way you can stop us .
you are weak . it is the strong who will prevail !
the truth is clear !
there are only winners and losers , nothing more !
and we , as the winners , will take back the power !
we will make the rules
and we &apos;ll be the ones who carry out their enforcement !
what a bunch of nonsense ! you &apos;re nothing more than a terrorist !
a petty thug with delusions of grandeur !
let me ask you , elihas .
what is it that you &apos;re really fighting for here ?
in the long history of our world ,
the oppressors who had the power were ruthless !
the oppressed were at their mercy !
you know what that &apos;s like . you were weak , and now you &apos;re strong !
don &apos;t others deserve to feel that power ?
we can give that power to the people !
help us . with your assistance , elihas ,
we can change the whole world .
leviathan saved you .
in the end , leviathan will save us all
through the exercise of real power !
shut up !
as i said before ,
my eyes are open now !
give up now . you can &apos;t save this world .
so you say .
but i &apos;ve got news for you , pal . we &apos;re sure as hell gonna try .
idiots !
how dare you ?
now , elihas !
come on , the party was just getting started !
so disappointing .
i &apos;m finally face to face with the man who started all this .
don &apos;t do this , frank !
it &apos;s time for you to face your crimes , mister .
because of your weapons many innocent people have died !
frank , don &apos;t !
no !
elihas !
satisfied with your heroics now ?
you were willing to go through all this
and put your life on the line to protect just one woman ?
you fool .
in the end , you &apos;ve sacrificed yourself in vain , for no good reason .
now you and your grand gesture
will disappear altogether !
tasha !
he was just deluded !
it was you , you pulled his strings
and caused all this !
and for that , you deserve to die .
i just wish i could have been your hero .
i know that .
but in the end , you were .
and always will be .
ta ...
sha ...
i realize now , castle , it was a mistake
to pull you into this . a big mistake .
we needed both orion and elihas alive .
their testimony was critical in our efforts
to uncover everything that leviathan was up to .
at the very least ,
we could have gotten orion ,
if you hadn &apos;t ignored your orders and killed him !
i don &apos;t work for you or for s.h.i.e.l.d.
i operate on my own terms , and i do what needs to be done when you won &apos;t .
and i &apos;ve got a newsflash for you . i really don &apos;t give a damn
if you like it or not !
natasha , arrest him .
excuse me ?
what &apos;s wrong ? didn &apos;t you hear me ? i said to arrest him !
you &apos;re accused of murder and you face life in prison .
director !
frank !
just do what you have to do .
that &apos;s how your justice works . right , natasha ?
go ahead and follow your rules .
you know i did the right thing .
some people needed to die . i was just the executioner .
it &apos;s your responsibility to make sure he &apos;s locked up , natasha .
you heard him , it &apos;s my responsibility .
i hope you don &apos;t escape by accident .
sure about this ?
oh , yeah .
and why is that ?
you do things your way ,
i do things my way .
see you later , frank .
where &apos;s castle ?
i just threw him in the ocean .
well , just between you and me , i hope he never comes up .
it &apos;s been a pretty tough few weeks , sweetheart .
i tell you , i &apos;m physically and mentally drained !
you know what they say , no rest for the wicked .
but tonight , nothing stops me from having a good time .
