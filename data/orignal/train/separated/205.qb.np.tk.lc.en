gossip gril here , you &apos;re one of the resources
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
vanessa stole my phone
and sent an e @-@ mail to my professor .
i did not do this .
i wanted to be friends ,
but what did you expect me to do ?
serena &apos;s professor is colin--
our cousin colin .
and what &apos;s the problem ?
i need him . he pays for my school , my rent .
relationships with faculty are strictly forbidden .
i don &apos;t think i can make it six weeks .
at least we stopped ourselves
before we made a mess of everything .
no one found out , so we &apos;re safe .
you &apos;re different than anyone i &apos;ve ever known .
well , you know what ? just save it .
&apos;cause you &apos;re exactly like everyone i &apos;ve ever known .
a peace treaty based on more than just a handshake .
morning , upper east siders .
hope you had a good night &apos;s sleep ...
or at least a good night &apos;s play .
i need to talk . i &apos;m having colin issues .
and boundary issues .
ladies knock .
and besides , the only issue
you should be having with professor forrester
is the topic of your midterm .
now if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;d like to
hit the snooze button on this conversation
and go back to--okay .
all i can think about
is how much i wanna be on his arm at the ballet .
and instead ,
i &apos;ve got the dean &apos;s target on my back .
how are we supposed to even try to have a relationship ?
i hate it when the duvet puffs up like that .
maybe it &apos;s just the way you &apos;re sitting .
i know we agreed to wait , but it feels like meanwhile ,
life is just passing us by . it &apos;s--it &apos;s not fair .
life is tough , serena . just ...
get a helmet .
or at least borrow one of my chapeaus .
wear it all day to remind you not to lose your ...
head . get on ! go !
well , thank you for the great advice .
this comforter blocks out so much noise ,
they could sell it at bose .
this has got to end .
i thought it just did .
that was the last time .
hey . i &apos;m , uh , headed over to my dad and lily &apos;s for breakfast .
do you wanna come ?
actually , i have a lot of work . but if you could swipe
some santa maria novella soap for me while you &apos;re there ...
that &apos;s right . the , uh , olive oil , not the mint .
i know .
i had no idea you were a colin forrester fan .
i saw matt lauer interview him
on the &quot; today &quot; show recently .
yeah ? what what was it about ?
who was cuter . or maybe that was just me .
well , he &apos;s no maria bartiromo ,
but he is serena &apos;s professor ,
and she &apos;s been raving about him , so i figured i &apos;d borrow
that book from her .
and you checked out of this conversation
the minute the &quot; s &quot; word came up .
sorry , but ever since the hamilton house debacle ,
i &apos;m dead to anyone in serena &apos;s life ,
except for you . nate doesn &apos;t even return my calls .
well if it makes you feel any better ,
he &apos;s not talking to me , either .
he &apos;s still pissed that i stole that treaty .
well , unlike you , i didn &apos;t do anything .
juliet framed me . she &apos;s crazy .
is any of this ringing a bell ?
vanessa , let &apos;s not get into this again .
we--we put it behind us .
we &apos;ll leave it there . all right ?
i got it . we &apos;re good .
i &apos;ll call you later .
sorry i &apos;m late .
i had to pull an all @-@ nighter just to finish &quot; persuasion &quot;
for my comp lit class .
apparently , even jane austen can have a misfire .
nice try . you &apos;re just trying to avoid
finishing our conversation from the other night .
you promised me you weren &apos;t in contact with ben .
i &apos;m all he has . it &apos;s not that easy for him .
prison shouldn &apos;t be easy ,
especially when you deserve to be there .
he didn &apos;t do it .
you &apos;re the only person that thinks that .
why else would his lawyer have him plead guilty ?
look , i understand he &apos;s your brother and you love him ,
but you are playing with fire .
oh , really ? and you &apos;re not ?
what is that supposed to mean ?
i saw the way that you were looking
at serena van der woodsen
at blair waldorf &apos;s party the other night .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;m running late ,
so let me just say this-- i may pay for your life here ,
but if you continue to see your brother ,
it will cost you , and this is what you will lose .
you know how much money you can make in lobsters ?
no , daniel , i do not .
sorry , i just kind of assumed
when you invited me for family breakfast
that there would be , uh , more ... family involved .
yeah , so did i , but i forgot about
lily and eric going to his interview at wesleyan .
and serena ? do you know where she is this morning ?
&apos;cause , i mean , you know , nate mentioned ...
uh , she might be seeing someone .
well , lily hasn &apos;t said anything . why don &apos;t you just ask her ?
because i have a vested interest in her answer .
things between us got so sidetracked
after everything with milo and--and--and vanessa .
i just would like to get them figured out once and for all .
i don &apos;t know how she feels .
so take her to coffee or something and ask her .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;ll just go find her on campus .
i &apos;m gonna go for broke today .
i &apos;m glad i could be so influential .
oh , no , it &apos;s actually the title of chapter one here--
&quot; going for broke , &quot; but , um , you &apos;re awesome , too , dad .
yo ! where have you been ? you haven &apos;t been home in days .
well , the new york marathon was this weekend .
those women run 26.2 miles in under 3 hours ,
so their warm @-@ ups are key .
what about you ?
things back on with juliet ? a romantic rendezvous ?
no , that &apos;s over .
i &apos;m just actually swinging by her place
to return her things she left at the suite .
i just gotta get rid of them so i can finally be done .
closure-- the unobtainable goal .
in my personal experience ,
the closest i &apos;ve come to getting it
is through mass amounts of hate sex .
but that &apos;s just me .
i think i &apos;ll stick to giving juliet
her shampoo and copy of &quot; the help &quot; back .
well , you go ahead .
i &apos;ve left my blackberry in the limo .
you &apos;re holding it .
then i need another ristretto . see you around .
what if someone sees ?
you don &apos;t like that anymore ?
no , you idiot .
i mean , what if someone we know sees ?
what--what am i saying ? there will be nothing to see .
this ends here .
what about over there ?
okay . hurry .
you realize this breaks our pact
not to be alone together .
ah , it wasn &apos;t us . it was fate . i mean , can we help it
if we &apos;re in the same place at the same time ,
hailing the same cab ?
it has happened before .
numerous times , which is why you know how long
it would &apos;ve taken to hail another one during rush hour .
i &apos;m having a whole new appreciation
for leather seats with duct tape .
though where i really wanna be with you
is at the ballet tonight . it would be in public ,
so we &apos;d be forced to restrain ourselves .
unfortunately , i know more than a few columbia faculty members
who are big supporters of the balanchine .
probably not a good idea .
you &apos;re right . i just hate that we have to wait over a month
to have another accidental cab ride together .
unless that &apos;s enough for you ?
why don &apos;t we go away for the weekend ?
what ?
we can go to harbour island .
we can spend days on the beach
and nights having long talks over dinner .
separate rooms , of course ,
so no rules get broken .
we &apos;re almost there . what are you thinking ?
i &apos;m packing in my head already .
in a city that never sleeps ,
it &apos;s important to always be alert ...
because if you blink ,
you might miss something ...
or someone .
yes , hi .
i need to make an appointment with dean reuther right away .
i have something that she wants to see .
but be careful ,
since the truth can be eye @-@ opening .
hey , excuse me .
i &apos;m dropping some stuff off for juliet sharp .
who ?
juliet sharp . uh , 4a , i think it is ?
i &apos;m sorry . there &apos;s no one named sharp in this building ...
or juliet for that matter ,
at least not in the eight years i &apos;ve worked here .
good morning , upper east siders .
this is your wake @-@ up call .
serena . what are you doing on campus so early ?
watching you climb out of a brownstone vestibule
with chuck following like the bass that ate the canary .
and no denials . your skirt &apos;s on backwards .
no , it isn &apos;t .
fine , i may have slipped up a little ,
but it &apos;s just sex , and a one @-@ time thing at that .
or maybe a 5 @-@ time thing . okay , if we &apos;re being honest ,
i &apos;ve lost count how many times ...
though that depends on what you &apos;re actually counting as--
blair , what are you doing ? you &apos;ve come so far .
don &apos;t fall off the wagon now .
i haven &apos;t .
it &apos;s just your ordinary , run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill ex sex ,
fueled by the most common of aphrodisiacs
mutual loathing and disdain .
may i remind you that both of those are feelings ?
and having any feelings for chuck
is where the problems always start .
there are about as many feelings between me and chuck
as there are thoughts in levi johnston &apos;s head .
we &apos;re nothing more than enemies with benefits .
and quite a lot of judgment
coming from you , elizabeth taylor .
you &apos;re about one inappropriate relationship away
from the guinness book .
colin and i actually had a very good talk this morning ,
and he wants a real relationship , too .
yes , i hear the 97th street transverse
is a lovely spot to drive past on a date .
i saw you get in that cab .
we happen to be going away this weekend
so we can get to know each other like a normal couple
while still adhering to our rules , of course .
please . do you forget what happens to you on vacations ?
there &apos;s a reason why you never get a tan line .
you have no willpower .
and you do ?
yes . i stopped having meaningful sex with chuck ,
and i can just as easily stop having meaningless sex with him .
in fact , i am going to call him right now and make it clear
that our little dalliance is finished forever .
and maybe you should follow my example
before you get your passport stamped again .
this how you return phone calls now ?
i went to juliet &apos;s apartment this morning ,
and it turns out she doesn &apos;t live there . she never has .
what ?
look , i &apos;m sorry , vanessa .
i should &apos;ve believed you when you said she set you up .
juliet &apos;s a liar .
she &apos;s been lying to me this whole time .
finally ! took someone long enough .
but seriously , i @-@ i appreciate you telling me .
enough to help me find out what she &apos;s hiding ?
let me see ... writing a paper on hannah arendt
or a secret mission that might help me clear my name ?
let me grab my bag .
all right .
why do you have mad face ? is everything okay ?
no , it &apos;s not okay . you should know better .
i think i missed something .
i didn &apos;t . i saw you this morning
getting out of a cab with colin forrester .
are you having an affair with your professor ?
well , technically , he &apos;s a guest lecturer ,
and , no , it &apos;s not an affair because we agreed
not to do anything until the semester &apos;s over .
it &apos;s romantic .
what would be romantic
is him actually making a sacrifice for you .
what are you saying ?
when we were together , i would &apos;ve done anything for you .
so if this billionaire really cares about you ,
then why can &apos;t he quit teaching , take you on a date ?
you &apos;re worth more than a guest lecturer fee .
everyone knows that . i just wish you did .
sex in the limo .
we &apos;ve literally come full circle .
you &apos;re right . we need to do whatever we can to end this .
it may be difficult , but ... it &apos;s the only way .
arthur , we need to pick up some klug du mesnil &apos; 95 ...
and lots of condoms .
it &apos;s going to be a long day of immersion therapy .
if blair and i are going to end this ,
we &apos;ll have to have sex as many times as we can
in the next 24 hours .
dorota , you have to keep me away from chuck
for the next 24 hours , no matter what .
but , miss blair--
don &apos;t &quot; miss blair &quot; me !
the only way to be done with this thing once and for all
is to have a bass @-@ ectomy . now help keep me occupied .
hey . i was just on my way to your office .
look , i &apos;ve been thinking ...
think no more . we &apos;re about to go on vacation .
we leave tomorrow morning . at least i do .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;m on a 9 : 00 a.m. flight , and you &apos;ll be on the 11 : 00 .
separate flights ?
we &apos;ll meet at the pink sands . your room &apos;s under your name .
i always book mine under &quot; buffett . &quot;
uh @-@ oh . i can tell you &apos;re thinking again .
yeah , i &apos;m just thinking
maybe this trip isn &apos;t such a great idea .
okay . fine . we won &apos;t go anywhere .
we &apos;ll just go back to waiting , tough it out .
but we shouldn &apos;t have to . we say we want a real relationship ,
but the truth is
neither one of us is willing to make a sacrifice .
i &apos;m confused . we both knew the deal going in .
what &apos;s changed ?
i did , i guess .
i don &apos;t know . maybe we &apos;re not such a great idea .
what happened when you got out of the cab ?
we both know that this is just a case of bad timing .
i &apos;m just the first one to say it .
i &apos;m sorry .
i was surprised you called .
i really thought you never wanted to talk to me again .
&apos;cause you broke up with me
doesn &apos;t mean we can &apos;t be friends , right ?
sorry . chuck &apos;s asking where the batteries are .
okay , now i know you &apos;re lying .
i wish i knew when you were .
it would &apos;ve saved me a lot of time now , wouldn &apos;t it ?
nate , what &apos;s going on here ?
i should be asking you that .
i went to your apartment today ,
and they said you don &apos;t live there , okay .
and i thought for sure i was done giving a damn about you ,
but i just can &apos;t let it go .
i mean , why--why do you need to lie about everything ?
because i didn &apos;t want you to see where i really live .
my actual apartment is a studio on 126th street ,
i couldn &apos;t even afford that if it weren &apos;t for my cousin .
he pays for my rent , my tuition ,
and the rest of the stuff , i scrape together
or ... return ...
when i can , okay ?
so that &apos;s what you &apos;ve been hiding ? that--that you &apos;re ...
poor ?
do you really think
i would &apos;ve been keymaster of hamilton house if people knew
i took metro north to woodbury common twice a month ?
or that i do my own hair ?
and would nate archibald
really have wanted to date me if he knew i lived
above a bodega in a fifth floor walk @-@ up
with fluorescent lights and ikea furniture i put together myself ?
when my dad went to jail , i had nothing , okay ?
so i know--i know what it &apos;s like to feel the need to keep up .
i &apos;m sorry i lied to you . i was ashamed .
and that &apos;s the reason i broke it off between us ,
because i ... i didn &apos;t want to get too close .
but i did really like you ,
and i still like you .
i should probably get going--
no , no , no , no . wait . wait .
you ... finally told me the truth ,
and i &apos;m a big believer in second chances .
i &apos;ve had a couple in my life .
there &apos;s the , uh , winter opening
for the new york city ballet tonight .
would you wanna come ?
maybe wear a dress that you actually own ,
even if it &apos;s from woodbury common ?
yes , i would love to .
thank you for understanding .
you can &apos;t even imagine how much it means to me .
they say a picture &apos;s worth a thousand words .
but in this case , it seems like
there &apos;s only three letters to adequately describe
these pictures-- o.m.g.
dorota !
blair , is there something we need to talk about ?
this is no cause for concern , serena .
i know i said i was quitting chuck , and i am .
it &apos;s just a bit harder to chuck chuck than i thought .
what if i need sex rehab
like jesse james ?
you &apos;re gonna overcome this ,
maybe because i overcame my obstacle today .
i showed some willpower , and i broke up with colin .
good for you .
for once , you &apos;re thinking with your brain
and not with your ...
macaroon ?
if he really wanted to be with me ,
all he needed to do was just drop the class .
it was a class that he didn &apos;t want or need to teach anyway .
you are serena van der woodsen .
you deserve a guy
who would move mountains to be with you if he had to .
i &apos;ve been thinking about that all day .
and you &apos;re blair waldorf .
fortitude is your talent . stay strong .
i &apos;ll see you at the ballet . gotta go make a call .
thank you for letting me come by .
i just--i wanted to let you know in person that
i heard what you said about ben ,
and i &apos;m taking your advice .
i &apos;m cutting off all communication with him .
glad to hear it . what changed your mind ?
there &apos;s this guy that i like ,
and i broke up with him because ben wanted me to .
and now this guy , nate-- he wants to try again .
and i can &apos;t say no to a second chance .
it &apos;s just ... it &apos;s so hard giving up on ben .
i mean , you remember what he was like before ?
he was so optimistic , idealistic .
i mean , the day he became a teacher
was the happiest day of his life .
and i guess i just-- i still see him like that .
i know , but he &apos;s not that person anymore .
he &apos;s a 26 @-@ year @-@ old convict
who still hasn &apos;t taken responsibility for his actions .
he &apos;s not gonna be able to move on
until he accepts what happened .
i guess i don &apos;t want to accept it either .
but i have to .
i have to stop talking to him for my own good .
thank you .
sometimes you have to let things go ,
so there &apos;s room for better things to come into your life .
well put .
your words . &quot; winner ! &quot; chapter three .
those were my words , weren &apos;t they ?
mm @-@ hmm .
thank you .
what are you doing here ? !
step any closer , and i &apos;ll scream .
you better believe you will .
if we &apos;re going to end this , we have to start
the immersion therapy right away .
what are you talking about ? this is a detox .
we have to stay away from each other .
where &apos;s the fun in that ?
cleanses aren &apos;t fun . they &apos;re effective .
you know what &apos;s even more effective ? excess .
eat anything too much , and you won &apos;t want it again .
i hope you did your yoga . this could go on a while .
no !
miss blair , no !
professor forrester is downstairs .
what ? why ?
he &apos;s here for me as my date .
a date ?
yes , and i must leave now
to go to the ballet with him
and not have sex with you .
if kgb can &apos;t get me to talk ,
chuck bass has no chance .
hey .
hey . what are you doing tonight ?
i got a hot date with some grimaldi &apos;s and netflix . why ?
well , i ended it with colin .
oh , you did ? that &apos;s terrible .
no , you were right about him , so it &apos;s actually good .
but dvds and pizza , really ?
what , you got a better offer ?
how do you feel about ballet ?
watching or performing ?
meet me at the lincoln center fountain
in an hour , and we &apos;ll discuss both after .
okay , i &apos;ll be there .
blair . is serena here ?
no , but the better question is , why are you here ?
i came to my senses
and did what i should &apos;ve done weeks ago .
i called the dean and told her
i am done teaching at columbia ,
even managed to find a replacement .
just when i had written you off ...
well , not &quot; just . &quot; i kind of wrote you off weeks ago .
sorry . but now you &apos;re coming with me .
we &apos;re gonna go find serena
so you two unfairly genetically blessed people
can be together , and i can escape
the best sex of anyone &apos;s life based solely on principle .
and if anyone asks , you &apos;re my date .
blair !
hurry . there &apos;s a bass on the loose , and it &apos;s hungry .
actually ...
so am i.
vanessa ! what ...
how did you know that i--
that you live here ?
i saw you check into ollie &apos;s a lot on foursquare ,
so i paid the delivery man to give me your address ,
and slipping some cash to your super
got me in your door .
you should probably move to a safer neighborhood .
why would you break into my apartment ?
because i was looking for something to prove to everyone
that you &apos;re the crazy liar that i know you are .
and , well , mission accomplished .
and then i found this .
please , you don &apos;t understand .
juliet , i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t believe you
when you said serena sent the e @-@ mail .
you were right . she was trading sex for grades all along .
but don &apos;t worry . your secret is safe with me .
i &apos;m far more interested
in exposing serena van der woodsen
than some petty class pretender .
thanks , i guess ,
but i don &apos;t plan on showing those pictures to anyone .
why not ?
you have just what you need to destroy serena
and vindicate me .
vanessa , i am so sorry that you got dragged into this ,
and i wish that i could fix it for you ,
but i &apos;m no longer interested in taking down serena .
in fact , the only thing
that i &apos;m doing with those photos is deleting them .
you--you--you can &apos;t be serious .
you have just what you need
to show the world who serena really is ,
and you just now decide to change ?
i had to make a choice , so i chose .
fine .
it &apos;s better if we put this behind us .
looks like the chip on vanessa &apos;s shoulder
just went digital .
colin , this is gillian murphy and ethan stiefel
of american ballet theatre .
excuse me . i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll see you inside , yeah ?
yeah .
dan humphrey at the opening night of the ballet ?
let me guess-- serena &apos;s date ?
ah , and you were last week .
yeah .
she &apos;s probably just using you
to make that colin guy jealous ,
just like she used me at blair &apos;s .
actually , she and colin broke up .
is that so ?
hi !
i don &apos;t understand . you brought colin as your date ?
are you on a sugar high ?
no . he &apos;s your date , not mine .
shall we head inside ?
sorry , man .
you shouldn &apos;t have thought you were any different .
i resigned from columbia .
i don &apos;t care about being a teacher .
i care about being with you .
i can &apos;t believe you did that .
what i can &apos;t believe is
how long it took me to do it .
blair , we need to talk , or , rather , not talk .
what don &apos;t you get ? i &apos;m here with a date .
professor forrester isn &apos;t a date . he &apos;s a distraction .
keep your focus .
give in to your desires , your needs .
let &apos;s finish this the right way .
colin isn &apos;t a distraction . you are .
what ?
he and i made a deal .
we couldn &apos;t be together until the class was over ,
but it &apos;s so hard .
so i had to work out my desires somewhere .
nice try .
i &apos;ll be waiting in a telephone booth
across from the dress circle .
see you in five .
help yourself , sir .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
opening night of the ballet-- tuxedos , champagne .
of course you &apos;d be here .
just a heads @-@ up , serena &apos;s here ,
blair , chuck , the whole gang .
the person i &apos;m here to see is dean reuther .
she &apos;s a big supporter of the ballet .
i @-@ i assume she &apos;s around here somewhere .
everyone your own age is mad at you ,
so you &apos;re befriending the dean ?
juliet was right about serena .
she &apos;s having an affair with her professor .
how do you know that ?
i found pictures of serena and colin forrester
at juliet &apos;s apartment .
what ? juliet took photos of serena ?
and now everyone will know the truth .
vanessa .
don &apos;t do that .
why ? for serena ?
sorry , nate .
dan , wait .
i think i &apos;ve waited enough .
tell me something , serena .
how--how far down the list did you get
before you called me to be your date ?
i mean , obviously , you couldn &apos;t come with colin
since he &apos;s your professor , and nate was last week &apos;s beard .
so--so what does that make me ? bachelor number three ?
i didn &apos;t know colin was coming .
i also didn &apos;t know that he quit his job to be with me .
okay . so what now ?
why do i even ask ?
thank you , all , for coming to tonight &apos;s benefit ,
kicking off the winter season of the new york city ballet .
tonight &apos;s program is dedicated to the late george balanchine ,
a true pioneer in the world of dance
and the founder of this great organization ,
and a good friend of mine .
hear , hear !
hear , hear .
excuse me .
yes ?
dean reuther , hi .
oh ... my ...
vanessa abrams , is that you ?
my apologies , dean .
i haven &apos;t seen this one since ... exeter !
no problem , ms. sharp . have a nice evening .
you , too .
exeter ? seriously ?
what are you doing here ?
and why were you talking to the dean ?
maybe because you aren &apos;t .
i gave you back your camera , but i kept the memory card .
hey , i thought we decided not to do anything with that .
no , you decided .
i &apos;ve been losing to serena for three years ,
watching her get away with anything and everything ,
and i &apos;m over it .
tell you don &apos;t feel the same way .
i mean , there &apos;s obviously a reason you took these photos .
yeah , there was , but i had a change of heart .
if you &apos;re doing this because of nate ,
then you should know the truth . he set you up .
how do you think he took you to coffee out of the blue ?
he kept you occupied while i searched your apartment .
and i , uh , told nate about the photos .
and i &apos;m pretty sure he &apos;s filling in blair right now .
face it . at the end of the day , you &apos;re an outsider just like me .
and if it &apos;s ever between one of us and serena van der woodsen ,
they will always choose serena .
excuse me , dean reuther .
i have something that you need to see .
put on your toe shoes , serena .
it &apos;s gonna be hard to dance your way out of this one .
i have proof that erena van der woodsen
is having an affair with her professor .
ms. sharp , i am here with friends .
this is the one night of the year
where i get to try and put everything else out of my mind
and just enjoy myself .
dean reuther , may i please have a moment with you ?
of course you &apos;re involved with this , ms. waldorf .
i told you and ms. van der woodsen
to try and stay off my radar .
dean reuther , i &apos;m not lying .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing that concerns you , professor ,
or concerns anyone for the moment .
actually , it does concern colin .
he &apos;s the one in the photos with serena .
is that why you resigned your position today ?
while it &apos;s true that i resigned
because of my involvement with a student ,
it &apos;s nobody &apos;s business who that student is .
all that matters is that the responsibility is mine ,
and i took it by leaving my post .
that &apos;s somewhat admirable , colin .
and while usually it &apos;s the professor
in the student @-@ professor relationship
that takes responsibility for any impropriety ,
if that student is under suspicion
of trading sex for grades in the past ,
i think we might need to examine the situation
a little more closely .
oh , let me get my camera .
here . look as close as you want .
oh , let me help you with that . oops .
you didn &apos;t want to look at those photos anyway
because it wasn &apos;t serena in them .
it was me .
blair , you don &apos;t have to do this .
why would i jeopardize my college career by lying ?
so go ahead , fire colin . oh , wait . he already quit .
so let &apos;s just go in and enjoy some jette .
allegro !
if i could say something ,
i , for one , completely corroborate ms . waldorf &apos;s story .
she was indeed having an affair with professor forrester .
i know this because i keep tabs
on everyone blair sees and talks to ,
due to my ... insatiable jealousy .
though she did state something to the effect
that he didn &apos;t quite satisfy her like i used to .
it &apos;s true .
don &apos;t you see ?
they &apos;re all protecting each other .
this is what they always do .
i &apos;m sorry . who are you ?
ms. sharp , the reality is
that with no proof ,
i can &apos;t tell who is telling the truth .
yeah , well , there was proof , until blair drowned it .
juliet , i don &apos;t like tattletales much more
than i like young women who use their sexuality
to further their academic careers .
so if you will please excuse me ,
i &apos;m going to try my best to enjoy this performance ,
which , hopefully , is a little more graceful
than the one i &apos;ve just seen . good evening .
excuse me , serena .
you took photos of me ? ! what the hell were you thinking ? !
you should &apos;ve never gotten involved
with serena van der woodsen in the first place .
i tried to warn you .
oh , yeah , you really had my back .
i always knew ben would eventually turn you against me ,
but i never thought you would do something like this .
it &apos;s not that simple . i never meant to hurt you .
in this case , the only person you hurt is yourself ,
because starting now , you are completely cut off .
as far as i &apos;m concerned . you are as dead to me as your brother .
colin !
now it &apos;s our turn .
your obsession with serena has grown tiresome .
just because you have no money and delusions of grandeur
does not make it okay for you to be a single white trash female .
nate , this isn &apos;t me . you know that .
why would i ever believe anything you say again ?
well , you can believe the part where she does her own hair .
you tried to destroy my friendship with blair ,
my reputation , my academic career .
you failed every time , and now it &apos;s time for you to go .
i &apos;m trying to .
she &apos;s talking about columbia .
you don &apos;t belong there anyway .
if we catch you hanging around again ,
there will be consequences .
and we &apos;re really good at payback .
spotted-- one ugly duckling exiled .
let &apos;s hope she doesn &apos;t turn into a black swan .
i am so sorry about everything .
i had no idea just how troubled juliet was .
oh , there &apos;s no way you could &apos;ve seen it .
she didn &apos;t like me before you and i met--or she and i met .
she was always jealous of mine and nate &apos;s past .
and when she found out i was seeing you ...
it was the last straw .
but i just don &apos;t understand why she would hurt you , though .
i mean , you guys are family .
and from what nate said , she owes you a lot .
well , it makes more sense than i &apos;d like it to .
our family history is ... pretty complicated .
but what i will never get
is how easy it is for some people
to throw away everything that &apos;s good just to settle a score .
well , hang around the upper east side
a little longer , and you &apos;ll see it all the time .
i &apos;m willing to take my chances if you are .
when i met you , i was running away from someone .
i &apos;m sorry that i ran right into you .
i &apos;m sorry you gave up teaching for me .
i feel awful .
to be honest , i was never any good .
i hate using a red pen ...
stop it .
and lecturing in front of kids wearing pajamas
is borderline degrading .
so what are you gonna do ?
oh , get back to doing what i do well--being a businessman .
no relationships , no roots . just ...
work .
that &apos;s a horrible idea . you &apos;re a good person .
someone deserves to have you do more
than just put them in a cab .
good luck , serena .
thank you .
hey , dan , i don &apos;t know where you are right now ,
but i just got back to my place ,
and i was wondering if we could meet .
i ...
nate
ignored
sorry . um , anyway ...
i &apos;ll wait outside for you . would it be cheesy
of me to say &quot; for however long it takes &quot; ?
bye .
would it be cheesy of me to say
&quot; for however long it takes &quot; ? bye .
end of messages .
serena . hey .
nate . hey , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;ve just been walking around , trying to clear my head
after everything that happened tonight .
i think it would take more than just a walk for that .
you know , when , um ...
we had that fight at fashion &apos;s night out ,
you were right .
it was ... it was juliet that made me turn on you
when you got back from paris .
you know , i can &apos;t help but wonder
what would &apos;ve happened if it weren &apos;t for her .
you know , maybe things would be different now .
different ?
the two of us , we &apos;ve been through so much together .
and i just ... god , i really miss you .
just give me a second chance .
i won &apos;t let you down .
sometimes in life , we hit a crossroads ...
and are forced to choose which path we want to take .
there &apos;s nothing i love more
than coming home with a victory under my belt .
what do you think our count is ?
for us , a million . the world--zero .
sometimes i think a takedown &apos;s better than sex .
don &apos;t get crazy now .
well , it &apos;s an endorphin rush .
plus it makes me think of old times .
i really appreciate you stepping up tonight .
i wanted to say you owe me ,
but for some reason , didn &apos;t feel right .
wow . holding back from a threat .
it &apos;s almost like something a friend would do .
maybe that &apos;s because that &apos;s what we are--friends .
well , who knew it &apos;d take tons of hate sex and a public takedown
for us to finally get here ?
i should be going .
good night , waldorf .
same to you , bass .
and there &apos;s no way of knowing
if our journey will lead us to pleasure
or to pain .
hi . um , i &apos;m juliet sharp .
you--you don &apos;t know me , but a friend of ours thinks
that we share mutual enemies on the upper east side , and , well ,
i could really use some help from the inside right now .
this--this is so weird .
you--you probably think i &apos;m crazy .
uh , well , if you are , i &apos;m sure they made you that way .
believe me , i know from firsthand experience .
uh , what exactly did you have in mind ?
once we &apos;ve made our choice , there &apos;s no turning back .
watch out , upper east side .
i think this could be
the beginning of an ugly friendship .
