it &apos;s time for the contest
that &apos;s taking america by storm , &quot; stop that deejay . &quot;
fine . bring it on , chump .
so we got through the holidays in one piece , right ?
but the big bearded guy in the red suit
deserves one last trivia shout @-@ out .
now , we know he didn &apos;t deliver all these presents by himself .
so , name for me all of santa &apos;s 9 reindeer .
oh , i know this . prancer , dancer--
&quot; forgive me , sweetheart .
i tried to make it right . &quot;
hey , dave , take a look at this , would you ?
this arrived at my house last night .
it &apos;s a gift from harrison scott .
your buddy from vietnam .
&quot; appreciate everything you &apos;ve done for me . &quot;
the grips are a replica of the vietnam war memorial .
it &apos;s beautiful .
it &apos;s expensive .
what &apos;s the matter ?
a gift like this
would practically drain all of harrison &apos;s savings .
now , if you &apos;re trying to get yourself back on your feet ,
why would you do something like that ?
you talk to him ?
i left 3 messages where he lives
at new directions for veterans .
he hasn &apos;t returned my calls .
that &apos;s only been since last night .
i phoned his job this morning .
he hasn &apos;t shown up for work the past two days , either .
i &apos;m worried , aaron .
why don &apos;t you go out to los angeles and check on him .
what about our caseload ?
it &apos;ll be fine . you &apos;ve got leave coming .
you should go .
maybe i &apos;ll do that . thank you .
sure .
it &apos;s staged .
they got people on those programs
they know are gonna fight .
you should &apos;ve seen that guy &apos;s wife
when he brought his two girlfriends out on the stage .
hoo hoo hoo . punches flying everywhere .
it &apos;s a tv show .
it &apos;s fake .
whoa . your ass just got checkmated , homes .
it &apos;s checkers , not chess .
king me .
well , here &apos;s the problem , your majesty .
this right here where you &apos;re playing--
this is our office .
you want to come here , play a little game ,
you gotta pay us rent .
i said king me .
i ain &apos;t kidding , old @-@ timer .
cough it up , wallet and watch , both of you .
i faced a lot worse than you in korea .
you two @-@ bit punks don &apos;t scare me .
oh , yeah ?
well , i can get a whole lot scarier than this , grandpa .
what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;ve got a possible spree killer in cleveland .
details are sketchy , but 90 minutes ago
a man shot and killed two gang members
at a park on the outskirts of the city .
why are we thinking spree ?
i mean , gang members shoot each other all the time .
because a third gang member fled the scene ,
the shooter hunted him down at a gas station
over a mile away to finish the job .
not your typical m.o. for a gang shooting .
oh , and there &apos;s more .
after the third gang member was killed ,
a fourth person was shot and killed at a bus stop
less than a half a mile away from the gas station .
also gang related ?
i don &apos;t know . details still coming in .
4 homicides , 3 locations , all within 90 minutes .
we need to hurry . wheels up in 15 .
i &apos;ll let morgan know .
can i help you with something , sir ?
how much ammunition can i buy ?
well , depends how much you need .
those .
that &apos;s 19.95 .
i &apos;m gonna need a lot more than that .
ok .
the road home
&quot; beware the fury of a patient man . &quot;
john dryden .
you know , the description of our unsub is pretty vague .
40s , 50s , rumpled clothing
like he could have been slept in .
and two witnesses in the park
said he appeared to have been drinking .
they could smell alcohol on him .
the first 3 victims all had police records--
car theft , aggravated assault , and drug dealing .
if they involve drugs , the unsub might be a disgruntled customer .
sorry . babysitting issues at home .
garcia , did we get confirmation that the fourth victim
at the bus stop was not gang affiliated ?
that is correct , sir . paul haller , high school senior .
not an angel , though .
haller has a few minor robbery arrests from the past ,
and police found a wallet on his body ,
cash and credit cards belonging to a sita patel .
purse @-@ snatching ?
gang members , mugger .
we might be looking at a vigilante .
all right , i just got off the phone with cleveland p.d.
if we are dealing with a spree killer ,
at least he &apos;s on a slower boil now .
no new incidents reported in the past hour .
the victim at the gas station wasn &apos;t just shot .
the body showed signs of having been run over multiple times
by a large vehicle .
that is one way to put the &quot; over &quot; in overkill .
morgan , you and jj go to
the park where the first shooting took place .
blake , go to the gas station crime scene ,
and as soon as we can find sita patel ,
reid and i will talk to her ,
see if she interacted with the unsub .
i was walking to work .
the boy grabbed my handbag ,
and then when i tried to hold on , he yanked hard ,
and i fell .
did anyone else see the attack ?
many people . but they did nothing .
nobody stayed to help ?
only one , a man .
did he say anything to you ?
he asked me which direction the boy went .
i told him and he left .
did the man leave on foot or in a vehicle ?
i didn &apos;t see .
he was very calm .
calm and determined .
all right , thanks for your help .
will you have your driver call me if he remembers anything else ?
appreciate that .
well , not exactly an outpouring of grief from the locals .
victims were bad news .
take a look at this .
the street sweeper had to go around
whatever was parked here .
i just got off the phone with the street @-@ sweeping team .
they said their truck passed by approximately 15 minutes
before the 911 call came in about the shooting .
that means the car was obviously parked there then ,
but gone before the police responded .
do we have a vehicle description ?
they said it was a two @-@ tone brown and beige suv .
out of state plates , and no license number .
street @-@ sweeping team said the car
was packed full of boxes and clothes .
the unsub was described as looking disheveled .
all right , so was the person in the car
a witness to the killings
or was he the killer himself ?
so , harrison didn &apos;t give you any indication where he might have gone ?
no . we asked his roommates , checked the local jails
and hospitals . nothing .
did you or anybody else
notice a change in him recently ?
mr. scott did seem a little different , now that you mention it .
in what way ? angry ? depressed ?
no . we see a lot of that here
and know how to deal with it .
no , with mr. scott it was ...
i don &apos;t know . he &apos;d stare right through you ,
like his mind was a million miles away .
were any of his clothes or personal belongings missing ?
it &apos;s hard to say .
our participants have so few possessions to begin with .
ms. grant , give me a chance to find him ,
to try to convince him to come back .
we have a very long waiting list ,
so , unfortunately ,
our policy about unauthorized absences is very strict .
after 3 days , the participant loses their spot .
mr. scott &apos;s been gone two days already ,
so that leaves you less than 24 hours .
i--
thank you .
ok , honey .
all right , bye @-@ bye .
terry ?
what are you doing here ?
terry , you &apos;re not supposed to be here . you know that .
terry--terry , please . terry , no , don &apos;t .
don &apos;t ! don &apos;t ! don &apos;t do this !
terry , stop !
terry , no ! stop , terry ! stop !
a restraining order ?
i &apos;ll call the cops on you . i swear it !
this was sent to me at my job .
in front of my clients , in front of my--
that &apos;s &apos; cause you never opened the door to the process server !
you shut up !
no !
what do you think about that restraining order now ?
who the hell are you ?
get your hand off her neck .
just go back to your cardboard box .
this doesn &apos;t concern you .
i said beat it .
sir-- ohh !
anything from sita patel ?
the man who asked which way the purse @-@ snatcher went
matches the description of the unsub .
how did it go at the gas station ?
maybe it &apos;s just me , but if i saw a person gunned down
and run over by a car a half a dozen times , i &apos;d remember it .
let me guess--witnesses are drawing a blank .
&quot; it all happened so fast . &quot;
no surveillance cameras at the gas station either .
it &apos;s a high @-@ crime area and the victims were criminals .
the neighborhood could be looking at this as a problem solved .
there &apos;s been another shooting .
my ex grabbed my throat ,
and the next thing i know , this guy was in the yard
and he shot terry and he took off .
can you describe the other guy ?
no . everything happened so fast .
coins were found scattered all around the area ,
like somebody emptied out their pockets ?
i didn &apos;t notice .
so when we analyze the coins ,
we won &apos;t find trace evidence of you or your ex on them--
no fingerprints--
ok . yeah , i think terry may have thrown some coins at the guy .
well , when we get back to the station ,
you can help the police artist render a likeness ?
no .
excuse me ?
you have no idea what it &apos;s been like .
the past two years i wake up every morning scared to death .
terry was crazy violent
and nobody would do a single thing about it .
he was issued a restraining order .
oh , yeah . you saw how restrained he was .
you want to see what he did once ?
i was cooking dinner ,
he got mad and threw scalding oil at me .
did you press charges ?
terry told everyone it was an accident .
that i dropped a frying pan .
but the police would have investigated , madison .
terry &apos;s mr. charity fund @-@ raiser ,
all @-@ around good guy at the country club .
it was my word against his .
please , give me a break .
but it &apos;s over now ,
thanks to that guy .
i hope you don &apos;t find him .
whoever it was ,
i hope he gets away .
what the hell are you doing here ?
we need to talk .
i got nothin &apos; to say . now get the hell out of here .
what are you gonna do , harrison ?
punch me ?
hit me over the head with that lamp ?
what happened ?
you came a long way for nothing . that &apos;s what happened .
it &apos;s been a long time since i &apos;ve been in here .
what , 35 years , maybe more ?
there used to be a pinball machine over there .
i see you &apos;re traveling light .
packed what i needed .
don &apos;t see anything else .
like i said ,
packed what i needed .
do i need to search this room for a weapon ?
i did not come here to blow my brains out , dave .
how the hell did you know that i &apos;d be here ?
educated guess . no money , no car .
i figured you &apos;d find someplace cheap and familiar .
as you know , we were stationed at pendleton .
we spent a lot of time here before we shipped out .
so , when i called and found out
that your old pal pete still owned this place--
the way you sniff people out ,
i should &apos;ve recommended you to recon division back in &apos; nam .
the seal on that is not broken .
you can check .
i haven &apos;t had a drop in 14 months .
but you brought it along just in case .
a person doesn &apos;t need to pull the trigger of a gun to kill himself .
why , harrison ? you were doing so well .
i got no answer for that .
i come to the end of my road , dave .
i &apos;m just sorry you had to come so far to see it .
there &apos;s somebody at the door .
go check .
yeah , who is it ?
you know who it is .
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know . it looks like some older dude .
what &apos;s the problem , man ? we &apos;re busy in there .
you know who i am .
hell , no . am i supposed to ?
i know who you are .
good for you . now mosey your ass back out of here .
i &apos;ve been waiting a long time for this .
victims were small @-@ time meth dealers ,
been in and out of jail for years .
what do you got ?
garcia patched in surveillance video from the hallway camera .
it &apos;s our unsub .
he walks straight to the meth dealers &apos; apartment ,
and that &apos;s consistent with his m.o. of targeting criminals .
but he stumbled on the first victims by chance .
he sought these out .
he &apos;s evolving .
garcia &apos;s trying to pull
surveillance video from the surrounding area .
we &apos;re looking for a two @-@ tone suv with out of state plates .
he looks straight into the camera .
he doesn &apos;t care who sees him .
you should eat .
nah , not hungry .
well , i &apos;ll save you some kung pao beef .
it &apos;s a little chewy , but ,
&quot; the early bird gets the worm ,
but the second mouse gets the cheese . &quot;
no .
want to hear yours ? it &apos;s pretty good .
those hills there .
what about &apos; em ?
my son thomas and his wife
live on the other side of those hills .
in carlsbad .
the son you haven &apos;t spoken to in a while ?
19 years .
i called him out the blue the other day .
what &apos;d he say ?
hello .
goodbye .
don &apos;t call again .
that was the gist of it .
i got a grandson
i didn &apos;t even know about , dave .
i could hear him talking in the background .
grandson
on the other side of the hill .
i ain &apos;t never gonna see him .
let &apos;s go , then .
no point .
permission to state the obvious , sir .
permission denied .
you spent the last of your money to come down here .
that &apos;s not someone who &apos;s throwing in the towel .
that &apos;s someone
who wants another chance .
i don &apos;t know , cruz .
we could be here another day or two .
why don &apos;t you send me a secure contact number
and i &apos;ll get back--
ok , yeah . well , you tell him mommy misses him .
talk to you soon .
what have you got , garcia ?
as your gigantic brain suspected , sir ,
a two @-@ tone suv with florida plates
was parked across the street from the apartment building .
were you able to pull a plate ?
the suv is registered to a clifford walsh .
do you have an address ?
nothing local .
walsh moved out of the area a long time ago .
and if you hate sad stories as much as i do ,
you should leave the room right now , &apos; cause this one &apos;s super sad .
10 years ago walsh lost his wife and his 14 @-@ year @-@ old son
in a home invasion robbery .
here in cleveland ?
yeah.it looks like the motive was stealing stuff .
jewelry has taken out of the home ,
and there was an attempted sexual assault on mrs. walsh .
where was walsh at the time of the home invasion ?
he was working as a night supervisor
of a tool and die plant in strongville ,
which is just outside the city .
did they get the killer ?
yeah , very next day .
howard clark , 18 years old .
high as a kite on meth at the time of the attack .
he was only sentenced to 10 years in prison .
the meth angle is interesting .
did clark have any connection with the victims in the apartment ?
yeah . he was buddies with dane hendrix , one of the victims .
10 years . that &apos;s awfully lenient for a double homicide .
you think ? maybe that &apos;s why walsh went into a total tailspin .
he started drinking , quit his job , moved to florida .
he &apos;s been like borderline homeless for many , many years .
when did he come back to cleveland ?
last week . he cashed out his meager savings account
and headed north .
here is what &apos;s interesting about the timing of this , though .
howard clark , the guy who killed walsh &apos;s wife and son ,
he was scheduled to be released 3 months from now ,
but he was killed in a random prison fight
in the exercise yard the day before walsh left florida .
that must have been the trigger-- clark &apos;s death--
that stirred up all memories .
and the memories brought him back to cleveland .
but for what purpose ?
the man we &apos;re looking for is clifford walsh .
the photograph you have of him was taken last year .
walsh &apos;s family died in a home invasion robbery 10 years ago .
the killer was a man named howard clark .
but clark &apos;s recent death
in prison may have triggered walsh &apos;s spree .
the first 5 murders appear to be opportunistic kills ,
but all the victims have
criminal records or a history of domestic violence .
the shooting at the meth apartment , however ,
was premeditated and calculated .
one of the victims was dane hendrix ,
a friend of howard clark &apos;s at the time of the home invasion .
targeting hendrix means walsh might now
be trending towards more mission @-@ oriented behavior .
walsh has no concerns about keeping his identity
or movements secret .
in some ways his recklessness works in our favor .
he &apos;s out in the open . here i am . come and get me .
but this is a man who &apos;s lost his family
and feels he has nothing to lose .
he doesn &apos;t care about repercussions ,
which makes him the most dangerous kind of spree killer .
time is of the essence . thank you .
agent hotchner .
we found walsh &apos;s vehicle .
&quot; forgive me , sweetheart .
i tried to make it right . &quot;
suicide note ?
walsh may have been about to kill himself
and saw the thugs hassling the old man .
but he killed them instead . well , that makes sense .
the line between suicidal and homicidal ideation is pretty thin .
look at this .
is he counting something down ?
the number sequence starts at 3,553 and ends ...
at 87 .
clark was killed on january 14th ...
87 days before his scheduled release date of april 11th .
working backwards and taking into account
the 2009 , 2012 leap years , 3,553 days ...
april 9 , 2004 , the exact day clark began his prison term .
so walsh was waiting for clark to be released
to take revenge on him .
and suddenly the object of his vengeance was gone .
but walsh &apos;s need for justice wasn &apos;t .
his revenge has simply found another outlet .
we need to see if any cars have been reported stolen
in the area in the last couple hours .
if walsh is swapping out vehicles ,
it would be the first indication
he &apos;s cared enough to take evasive action .
something else must be on the menu .
something important enough that
he can &apos;t risk being caught .
we need to figure out who &apos;s next on walsh &apos;s list of targets .
you know , walsh lost his wife and his child .
he could be looking to balance the books .
clark did get a light sentence .
walsh might have a grudge
against the judge or surviving jury members .
we need to get those names , as well as the defense attorney
and anyone who testified on clark &apos;s behalf .
the newspaper reports at the time
suggested clark might have had an accomplice .
it was just a rumor , but it was a persistent one .
maybe it was dane hendrix , the meth dealer ?
no , he had a solid alibi for the night of the home invasion .
clark always said he acted alone , but still ...
we need to locate and get
all of these people into protective custody .
this ain &apos;t gonna work , dave .
wait here .
can i help you ?
thomas scott ?
yes .
my name is david rossi .
i &apos;m a friend of your father &apos;s .
did he send you ?
no .
all i &apos;m asking is a few minutes of your time .
may i come in ?
don &apos;t take this wrong ,
but we &apos;ve got nothing to talk about .
tommy ...
please .
nothing in walsh &apos;s background
hinted at this type of psychotic break .
testimonials all reported him
as a solid , loving family man .
he supported his wife while she went through
a brief bout of depression .
when his son had problems at school ,
he took him to one of those expanded horizon treks .
you know , the second intruder theory has some validity .
how so ?
because walsh &apos;s wife was athletic
and his son played junior varsity football .
meaning it might have been hard for clark to subdue them both .
especially if his faculties were diminished by drugs at the time .
and mother and son were found
at opposite sides of the house .
you &apos;re right , hotch . someone might have been helping clark .
mr. hines ?
yes . can i help you with something ?
you know who i am .
no . sorry .
i know who you are .
look , i think you got the wrong place--
i &apos;ve been waiting a long time for this .
jeffrey ? what &apos;s happening ?
the victim is jeffrey hines .
he wasn &apos;t on our target list .
does he have a connection to walsh or clark ?
well , garcia can &apos;t find one .
hines and his wife moved to cleveland from hawaii last month .
what does his wife say ?
walsh came to the door , said something to her husband ,
and then he just opened fire .
something &apos;s off on this one .
maybe hines has a past she doesn &apos;t know about .
well , hopefully that &apos;s it .
why hopefully ?
because if there &apos;s truly no connection here ,
walsh is devolving .
he &apos;s killing random people .
i know he put his life on the line for his country .
i admire and i respect him for that .
unsung heroes .
a lot of good men come back from combat damaged .
they deserve another chance .
another chance .
mr. rossi , when i was 12 years old ,
my father told me he was never going to drink again .
for the umpteenth time .
and i believed him .
i was a kid .
then one day he takes me and 3 of my friends
to dodger stadium .
i can still remember the exact moment
the vendor put that first beer in his hand .
second inning , mickey hatcher at the plate .
one ball , two strikes .
i saw that beer and i knew what was coming .
my father got so drunk ,
my friends &apos; parents had to come pick us up and take us home .
take me home .
i &apos;m really sorry , thomas .
i could tell you 10 more stories just like that one .
this program my father &apos;s in ,
hopefully it makes him better ,
but my son is not going through
the same humiliation and disappointment that i did .
i don &apos;t hate my father , mr. rossi .
i don &apos;t not care about him .
i love him .
but i &apos;ve got to protect my family .
that &apos;s my priority .
all i ask is that you don &apos;t take
the possibility of forgiveness off the table .
not yet .
can i get you some more tea , mr. rossi ?
no , thank you , ma &apos;am .
i--i really should be going .
he &apos;s outside , isn &apos;t he ?
he &apos;s in the car .
i wish it were possible , mr. rossi ,
but it isn &apos;t .
i &apos;ve worked too hard to build a good home
for me and my family .
people can &apos;t build without tools .
and tools are passed down to us from others .
when you take in the life you &apos;ve built , thomas ,
and watch the life your son will build for his own family ,
remember that .
i knew i was crazy to hope .
i &apos;m sorry , harrison .
so i guess that &apos;s it , then .
your son &apos;s a fine young man . you should be proud .
i am .
i just wish i could tell him that to his face .
what now ?
you tell me .
i could take you back to the motel
and leave you with your vodka .
or , if i ignore every speed limit sign
between here and santa monica , i could get you back
to new directions just under the wire .
look , harrison ,
it took a long time to get to this point with your son .
it &apos;s not gonna fix itself overnight .
and on the international front ,
60 people , mostly women and children ,
are believed dead in a suicide bombing .
enough of that depressing stuff .
it &apos;s happy hour , for crying out loud .
things won &apos;t change .
excuse me ?
the world .
there aren &apos;t enough bullets to make things right .
you got that thing figured out with your neighbor yet ?
ah , jeez , the doggie @-@ doo wars .
i told you , that kid will never pick up after his mutt
when he goes on my lawn , right ?
but yesterday , it really hits me .
i &apos;m going about this all wrong .
it &apos;s not the kid &apos;s fault ,
it &apos;s the parents &apos; fault . they never taught him any better .
did you go talk to them ?
i did better than that .
last night , i scooped up the dog poop ,
walked next door , i set it right down
on mom and dad &apos;s welcome mat .
mi caca es su caca .
that &apos;s great .
take the problem to the doorstep .
go to the source .
this is strange .
the m.e. reports from the home invasion .
teddy walsh &apos;s wrists were tightly bound ,
but there were no subdermal hematomas
around the deep ligature marks .
what do you see here ?
someone clinging to memories .
it &apos;s basically a shrine to his wife .
more importantly , what don &apos;t you see here ?
his son .
exactly .
there &apos;s not a single photograph
or shred of memorabilia about him .
and the suicide note was addressed only to his wife .
garcia , you said teddy walsh
had gotten into some trouble at school , yes ?
yeah . nothing serious .
he stole a video game from another kid &apos;s locker .
and that &apos;s why walsh took his son on the expanded horizons hike ?
uh @-@ huh , that &apos;s right .
and expanded horizons takes people out in groups , yes ?
yes , sir .
ok , can you find out the names
of the other participants on that specific trek ?
let me see ...
oh . lordy , lordy .
howard clark and father .
walsh and clark were on that hike together .
i think we just found clark &apos;s accomplice .
walsh &apos;s own son .
we haven &apos;t found the connection with the jogger yet ,
but every victim of walsh &apos;s
has been associated with criminal behavior .
only the guilty deserve to die .
except today started with walsh ready to die himself .
he wrote a suicide note .
because he was guilty , too .
his own son was complicit in the death of his wife .
garcia .
talk to me .
are howard clark &apos;s parents still in the cleveland area ?
uh , father died 5 years ago , heart attack .
mother--yep , helen clark . sending her address now .
you said earlier that walsh might want to balance the books .
there &apos;d only be one person to provide that kind of payback .
another parent .
mrs. clark .
you know who i am , don &apos;t you ?
yes .
then you know why i &apos;m here .
am i going to die tonight ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;m afraid you are .
howard clark &apos;s mother won &apos;t answer .
the two boys probably hatched the plan
when they met on the hiking trip .
teddy knew where his mother kept the jewels
and when his father would be gone .
except clark shows up high on meth ,
tries to rape the mother , teddy fights back
and clark kills the both of them .
and that explains the lack of subdermal hematomas
on teddy &apos;s wrists .
he was killed first and then tied up .
jeffrey hines , the jogger who got shot ,
garcia found a connection .
it &apos;s not who he was , it &apos;s where he was .
your son doesn &apos;t look like much of a killer there .
neither did my son , though .
what are you talking about ?
my son teddy was in on it .
not the killing part .
but he made it happen .
i got a picture , too .
this is my wife , emma .
look at it .
i &apos;m so sorry .
if i &apos;d been a better dad ,
and you &apos;d been a better mom ...
it &apos;s too late for what @-@ ifs .
we can &apos;t blame ourselves for what happened that night .
no ?
i watched you in the courtroom
when you testified for your son ,
defending the murder of my family ?
i &apos;m a mother .
no matter what happens in this world ,
a child has a right to know there is somebody
who will stand up for them .
even if they &apos;re a cold @-@ blooded killer ?
the drugs had taken over my boy .
i know my son .
and what happened that evening , that wasn &apos;t who he was .
i thought i knew my son , too .
emma tried to warn me that he needed help .
small things ...
i didn &apos;t listen .
mrs. clark ,
do you think we &apos;re reunited
with loved ones after death ?
yes , i do .
i wish i did .
it &apos;s just a way for the living to cope
with loss .
i guess we &apos;ll both find out soon enough , won &apos;t we ?
are you scared ?
i think about fear a lot .
i try to imagine what emma must have felt
in those final moments .
clifford walsh , fbi .
put the weapon on the table .
no .
slowly lower it .
helen hasn &apos;t harmed anyone .
she &apos;s innocent .
wrong . i don &apos;t hurt the innocent .
wrong . you already have .
who ? the thugs in the park ?
the meth dealers ?
the guy that was choking his wife ?
you &apos;re forgetting about the jogger .
hines ?
let me tell you about him .
when hines worked to the d.a. &apos; s office ,
clark &apos;s father used his influence
to have evidence suppressed .
evidence ...
that would have sent my wife &apos;s killer to jail for life .
the former emplyee at the d.a. &apos; s office
was morgan hines .
6 months ago he sold that house to his brother jeffrey .
that was the man you killed .
no .
that was the place . i checked .
jeffrey hines was innocent , clifford ,
and you murdered him .
he left behind a wife and 3 kids .
when i saw the sun come up this morning ,
i knew it was gonna be my last time .
mrs. clark ...
i hope you &apos;re right .
how was your night ?
all squared away .
and i talked to my boss at work .
he &apos;s gonna let me keep my job .
great .
i sound like a broken record , but ...
thanks again for everything .
just focus on controlling what you can .
the rest of it will fall into place .
right .
one more thing .
that fortune cookie of mine back at the motel ,
what did it say ?
oh , yeah .
um , &quot; be careful to avoid
extravagant purchases this month . &quot;
well , i think i can manage that one .
well , then i &apos;ll count the
pistol you gave me as being part of last month .
i &apos;ll check in with you when i &apos;m back in washington .
&quot; forgiveness does not change the past ,
but it does enlarge the future . &quot;
paul boese .
you have any plans tonight ?
uh , does sleep count as a plan ?
i &apos;m going to a korean film festival in georgetown .
you can come with me if you want .
a lot of the entries probably aren &apos;t subtitled yet ,
but i can do a simultaneous whisper translation while we watch .
sounds fun .
i &apos;m really tired .
