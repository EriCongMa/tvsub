what i want is to work at pearson specter
and to keep seeing you .
those two things are not both gonna happen .
you &apos;ve been here for three months .
all you &apos;ve done is hit singles , and i need a goddamn home run .
jonathan , listen .
i don &apos;t want to hear it .
start making us some real money .
a man like walter gillis
isn &apos;t gonna listen to a guy like you
offering to save him with sunshine and rainbows .
walter ...
i can &apos;t guarantee you we &apos;ll win ,
but i can guarantee you that i will never sell you out .
all right , i &apos;m in .
you &apos;re talking hostile takeover .
gillis industries .
logan , we have a conflict .
you &apos;re either with me or against me .
that includes all $ 1 billion of my business .
get moving on drawing up a tender offer for logan sanders .
do you remember when i told you that i ...
that i once had an affair with a married man ?
it was him .
you &apos;re up early .
so are you .
well , i have to be . you don &apos;t .
i was already awake . thinking .
about last night ? look , mike , i--
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m good .
you &apos;re good with me working on the takeover with logan ?
why do you not seem to believe me ?
because you weren &apos;t good last night .
which was before this morning
when i realized that that &apos;s work .
this isn &apos;t .
so as long as we don &apos;t let that affect this ...
we won &apos;t .
in that case , let &apos;s set some in @-@ home ground rules .
obviously , the first--
uh , respecting each other &apos;s privacy .
exactly .
the left @-@ hand side of the desk
belongs to the united nation of ross .
you &apos;re not a nation .
i have a flag .
fine .
as long as we agree that any perusal of my phone
is considered a breach of my borders .
i thought you liked it when i breached your borders .
mm , well , those are different kind of borders .
in that case , a breach is allowed .
allowed ?
encouraged .
requested .
demanded .
let &apos;s go make you late for work .
jessica , i am telling you .
the s.e.c. is gonna send jeff malone after us ,
and nobody is better suited to beat him down than--
you guessed it
because we all know that
this is better than this ,
which will result in this ,
which will also result in this
and this
and this .
and what do i want in return ?
oh , you know what i want .
you &apos;ve always known .
and after i win ,
you &apos;ll not only be willing to give it to me .
you &apos;re gonna be begging to give it to me .
louis .
b--not now .
louis ,
b--not now .
i have to talk to you .
how many times have i told you ?
unless you have photoshopped my head onto a dragon ,
do not interrupt me while i &apos;m perfecting my pitch .
your pitch doesn &apos;t need to be perfect .
it needs to be now .
why ?
malone is here .
he &apos;s here ?
in the lobby .
and jessica just asked to see you .
oh , out of my way .
aren &apos;t--aren &apos;t you going to bring your easel ?
oh , i don &apos;t need an easel to kick this sucker &apos;s ass .
jessica .
jessica , i got your message , and i just wanted to--
louis , this is jeff malone .
yeah , i know who he is . he &apos;s with the s.e.c.
he was until this morning .
we brought him over
because we have reason to believe they &apos;ll be coming after us .
wait , what ?
jeff is our newest senior partner .
he &apos;s going to be taking on the s.e.c.
because you suck .
and i wanted to introduce him to you first
because you &apos;re a loser .
who can get him up to speed on felton securities .
because you &apos;re never going to be name partner .
and you &apos;re both experts in finance .
louis , i &apos;m really looking forward to
working with you on felton securities .
yeah , me too .
you suck . you &apos;re a loser .
louis ?
is there something else ?
no .
nothing .
how long you been working on that ?
two hours .
you know it &apos;s called a brief , right ?
you know his name &apos;s harvey , right ?
you make a compelling argument .
so i got your note .
what do you wanna talk about ?
logan sanders .
what about him ?
we sort of dated a few years ago .
wait , hang on . define &quot; sort of . &quot;
definitely .
define &quot; dated . &quot;
we had an affair while he was married .
holy shit .
i know . and i--
yes , you have to tell harvey .
because , rachel , if there &apos;s two things that harvey hates ,
it &apos;s things being kept from him and things being kept from him .
i know .
then what am i doing here ?
i don &apos;t know how to tell him .
quickly ,
because logan &apos;s gonna be here in an hour .
what ?
and , rach , it &apos;s less important how you tell harvey
than that you tell harvey .
go .
okay .
hmm . these are nice .
i was wondering all day if you would be here
i can &apos;t do this .
what ? rachel--
it &apos;s wrong .
wrong ? you &apos;re the one who kissed me .
and i was wrong .
no , you weren &apos;t .
my whole life i &apos;ve done everything
that i was supposed to do ,
and all it did was make me miserable .
ever since i met you ...
i can &apos;t stop thinking about you , and all i want to do--
logan logan , if we do this ,
someone &apos;s gonna find out at some point and then what ?
i don &apos;t care .
okay .
harvey , i need to tell you--
rachel ?
logan .
where &apos;s harvey ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m early .
he doesn &apos;t like it when people--
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m harvey &apos;s associate .
you did it . you went to law school .
not exactly . i &apos;m in law school .
rachel , that &apos;s great .
i &apos;m really proud of you .
i &apos;m just gonna come back .
you came in here to tell him about us , didn &apos;t you ?
how &apos;d you know ?
it &apos;s all over your face .
logan--
please don &apos;t tell him .
i have to tell him .
rachel ...
do you know what people think
when a son takes over his father &apos;s company ?
that his father &apos;s proud of him ?
that he didn &apos;t earn it .
which is why i &apos;m not looking to advertise the fact
that i once had an affair .
you &apos;re not advertising it . you &apos;re disclosing it to counsel .
okay , look , you want the truth ?
i &apos;m not proud of the way i was back then .
the way i treated allison , the way i treated you .
but i &apos;m not that person anymore ,
and i don &apos;t want people to think that i am .
and i understand that , but i work for harvey ,
and i can &apos;t keep things from him that he needs to know .
he doesn &apos;t need to know this .
yes , he does .
why is that ?
because i happen to live with the man on the other side
of the takeover battle .
oh , no . you need some me time already ?
it &apos;s not me time .
it &apos;s &quot; i &apos;m gonna kick your ass &quot; time .
i think we both know you only kick ass after eating a hot dog .
i could be drinking a juice box and still kick your ass .
i don &apos;t think so , because i have this .
just read it to me .
&quot; harvey specter , you are summoned to &quot; --
you gotta be kidding me . you &apos;re subpoenaing me ?
oh , yeah . i filed a t.r.o.
i &apos;m gonna block your tender offer .
bullshit , you are .
well , we &apos;ll see what the judge has to say .
oh , right . you got your hands full .
here , let me get that for you . there you go .
hearing &apos;s at 2 : 00 . i &apos;ll see you then .
oh , harvey , the suit--
it &apos;s a little dated for court , don &apos;t you think ?
did you get everything settled with hr ?
yeah .
corner office . you really must like me .
don &apos;t get too excited .
you know , the last two partners that had this office
didn &apos;t survive the year .
then it &apos;s a good thing i &apos;m much better than they were .
you don &apos;t even know who they were .
that doesn &apos;t matter , jessica . i know who i am .
me too , cocky lawyer in a corner office
who hasn &apos;t done a thing for me yet .
yet .
by the way , i understand it &apos;s tradition for the name partner
to welcome a new partner with lunch .
jeff , when i told you that our relationship
is now purely professional , i was serious .
jessica , what &apos;s not purely professional about lunch ?
unless you mean the sex that will be following lunch ?
oh , you &apos;re not hearing me .
oh , i &apos;m hearing you . i &apos;m just ignoring you .
but i promise i won &apos;t be ignoring you at lunch .
cocky .
harvey . harvey , can i talk to you for a minute ?
yeah , sure , come on in .
i was actually hoping that we could talk in my office .
what &apos;s the-- you &apos;re early .
did you ...
oh , you two haven &apos;t met .
rachel , logan . logan , rachel .
i guess you didn &apos;t .
didn &apos;t what ?
we actually have met before .
that &apos;s why i was trying to find you .
to tell me you met our client ?
no .
to tell you that we used to be in a relationship together .
you looking to get back together ?
no .
then i don &apos;t give a shit .
good .
then we can move on to why you didn &apos;t tell me that the guy
on the other side of this fight used to be your associate .
i was going to .
when ?
in 20 minutes , when you were scheduled to be here .
unfortunately , i have to reschedule .
why ?
i have court .
mike &apos;s alleging i broke privilege .
did you ?
yes , technically ,
when i told you to move up our timeline .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me .
w @-@ wait a minute . if you--if you broke privilege ,
what are you gonna tell the judge ?
i don &apos;t know , but until i think of something ,
i &apos;m going to confuse the shit out of everyone i can .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
it makes total sense .
no , it doesn &apos;t , your honor .
all right , hold on . let me get this straight .
you work for him ?
worked . i was his associate .
not the best associate , your honor .
is that relevant ?
no , but i &apos;d like it on the record .
well , it &apos;s on there now whether we want it there or not .
and all i &apos;m saying is , there &apos;s no attorney @-@ attorney privilege .
finally , a fact .
an irrelevant fact ,
because at the time of the conflict ,
i was his client .
not the best client either .
mr. specter , shut up . now you &apos;re his client ?
no , i was his client-- okay .
i was an associate at pearson specter ,
and then i left to become an investment banker .
it &apos;s very confusing .
i &apos;d dismiss the whole motion , your honor .
i said , &quot; shut up . &quot;
are you an attorney or an investment banker ?
i &apos;m an investment banker .
then what the hell are you doing in my chambers ?
acting as my own attorney .
and no matter how much he tries to confuse the issue , he can &apos;t .
i told him i was going after the same company he was ,
and he used that knowledge to move up his tender offer .
he waived conflict .
that doesn &apos;t apply to privilege .
bottom line is , he doesn &apos;t have proof of anything .
i don &apos;t , but he does .
unfortunately , he can &apos;t force me to testify .
there &apos;s no precedent .
fortunately , there is .
so go ahead , ask him if he did what i &apos;m saying .
mr. specter , do i need to swear you in ?
give him the t.r.o.
you know , i &apos;ll do more than that .
not only can &apos;t your client make a tender offer for 60 days ,
they can &apos;t purchase any more stock until then either .
i &apos;m telling you , we need to negotiate with him .
you mean pay him off ?
yes , that &apos;s exactly what i mean .
every day this drags on , it &apos;s millions out of your pocket .
well , from where i &apos;m sitting , all i can see is a lawyer
trying to distract me
from the fact that this whole thing is his fault .
if i didn &apos;t break privilege ,
he might have locked this whole thing up
before you knew what hit you .
fine . we &apos;ll negotiate .
no , i &apos;ll negotiate .
no , not without me .
do i need to draw you a picture ?
you , mike , rachel .
harvey , i appreciate your concern ,
but this is my first deal ,
so unless you &apos;re gonna pay him off with your money ,
i &apos;m gonna be at that meeting .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m writing in my diary .
isn &apos;t that what your dictaphone is for ?
no , my dictaphone is for my singular triumphs ,
like when harvey told me i was the man ,
and my diary is for my most agonizing defeats ,
such as when jessica just told me
i &apos;ll never make name partner .
louis , she didn &apos;t say that .
well , she might as well have .
she just gave malone the corner office .
oh , my god .
yeah .
and what &apos;s more
is i think i agreed to give him felton securities .
well , un @-@ agree to it .
i can &apos;t .
i shook his hand . the die is cast .
god damn it , louis .
you know how this works .
first it &apos;s a case . then it &apos;s a client .
before you know it , you &apos;re on the 38th floor with ted .
who &apos;s ted ?
exactly .
holy shit . what did i just do ?
i &apos;ll tell you what you &apos;re gonna do .
you &apos;re gonna stop writing in that pussy diary ,
and you &apos;re gonna show jessica you &apos;re the one
who should be sitting in that corner office .
all right .
ready the dictaphone . we &apos;re gonna need it .
how are things going with logan sanders ?
you have no idea .
do i want to have an idea ?
not unless you want to hear about
how mike ross is still causing us trouble .
nope .
you don &apos;t care about logan sanders at all , do you ?
no .
this isn &apos;t a coincidental encounter , is it ?
no , it is not .
you are having lunch with jeff malone today .
come on , jessica . you banged him .
the least you could do is take him to lunch .
that is not funny .
wait a second , you want me to take him to lunch
because you banged him .
harvey ...
i want you to go ahead
and say &quot; banged &quot; to my face one more time .
i &apos;m not going to but not because i &apos;m scared of you .
whatever lets you sleep at night , white boy .
donna , tell paul porter he &apos;s meeting me for lunch .
when he gets there , tell them to seat him with jeff malone .
who &apos;s he not having lunch with ?
jessica .
oh , done .
aren &apos;t you gonna ask me why ?
she asked you to go because she didn &apos;t want to .
you &apos;re sending porter because you don &apos;t want to ,
but you didn &apos;t have the balls to say no to her face .
is that it ?
the balls are debatable .
balls are never debatable .
ah , hey there .
hey .
louis , listen , i just , um ,
i just wanted to say one more time
how much i &apos;m really looking forward to working with you .
aww , well , i would just like to say for the first time
that you will not be working with me ,
because i will not be giving you my jock ,
let alone my case .
yeah .
okay , i get it .
so you &apos;re the guy ?
yeah , i am the guy .
no , not that guy , louis . definitely not that guy .
you &apos;re the guy in every office
who wants to piss on the new guy ,
you know , to mark your territory .
so why don &apos;t i just walk you on down to my office ?
i &apos;m gonna let you get your little piss on in my corner ,
and then we can move on .
oh , i &apos;ve moved on .
i &apos;ve set the deposition for todd smith tomorrow .
you don &apos;t think i know about that ?
i don &apos;t give a shit whether you know it or not .
it &apos;s my job to determine whether todd smith is guilty .
and who do you actually think is better at determining
whether a guy is guilty of insider trading , louis ?
a career prosecutor for the s.e.c.
or a monkey in some italian suit ?
a monkey ?
monkey .
well , you &apos;re nothing but a crowing cock .
and the last cock that walked into my office
learned what all the other cocks learned ,
that i eat cock for breakfast , lunch , and dinner .
louis , you &apos;re gonna let me
in that deposition tomorrow whether you like it or not .
why , because you &apos;re gonna run to jessica ?
no , simply because i &apos;m gonna tell everyone here in the office
that you said you eat cock for breakfast , lunch , and dinner .
yeah , that &apos;s right . it &apos;s goddamn delicious .
so what , you think you can handle todd smith better than me ?
well , let &apos;s just see . let &apos;s just see what you got .
saw you scheduled a meeting with mike .
i assume that means you &apos;re going to offer him a deal .
it could mean i &apos;m going to offer him a trip to disneyland .
but it doesn &apos;t .
of course not , he &apos;d probably want to wear mouse ears ,
and then nobody wins .
you &apos;re welcome .
i didn &apos;t thank you .
since you scheduled the meeting when i &apos;m at law school ,
which you did to cut me out .
did you get your name on the wall since lunch ?
no .
then let &apos;s get something straight .
i didn &apos;t set that meeting . donna did .
and if i didn &apos;t want you there , i &apos;d just tell you to your face .
so let me tell you now , you &apos;re not going to that meeting .
because you think i can &apos;t handle it ?
because i &apos;m not throwing gasoline on a pile of matches
just to see what happens .
now , if you &apos;re done wasting my time ,
you just gave me an idea .
you &apos;re welcome .
harvey , what are you doing here ?
you said it yourself .
i never brought you a gift when you moved in .
still don &apos;t see an orchid .
flowers die .
i thought i &apos;d bring something better .
me ...
across the table from you .
where &apos;s your client ?
he doesn &apos;t need to be here .
this fight started with you and me .
so let &apos;s you and me settle it right now .
you mean you don &apos;t want him here
because you don &apos;t think logan sanders and i
can be in the same room .
i don &apos;t think . i know .
harvey , i &apos;m a grown man .
i can sit across the table from somebody
who had a history with rachel .
maybe , but you both have a brain and a dick ,
and if you get in that room together ,
the brains aren &apos;t gonna be leading that conversation .
fine , you tell me that you have the authority to negotiate a deal ,
and i &apos;ll negotiate .
but you can &apos;t &apos; cause you don &apos;t .
and i &apos;m not gonna agree to something here today
just to have logan reject it tomorrow .
so go home , get some sleep ,
and then the three of us will do this again in the morning .
look , here &apos;s the thing , todd . you &apos;re not actually our client .
felton security is .
and it &apos;s my job to find out if you &apos;re telling the truth .
bullshit . it &apos;s my job .
louis , i &apos;m handling this .
no , you &apos;re not .
if he doesn &apos;t stop lying to me , i &apos;m gonna cut him looser
than jared &apos;s pants after a subway diet .
i &apos;m not lying to you .
you took a tip .
all right , todd , you took a tip , used it for your client--
yes , and now you &apos;re trying--
god damn it , louis !
listen , if you don &apos;t back the hell off my interrogation ,
i &apos;m gonna pick his scrawny ass up
and use him to beat the shit out of you !
stop it !
you think i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing ?
you &apos;re trying to rattle me .
what ?
your vein .
here ?
it &apos;s bulging .
just like mine did , right before my heart attack .
louis , he &apos;s not gonna--
what ? have a heart attack ?
that was exactly my thought ten seconds before i was slumped
on the courtroom floor .
oh , wow , it &apos;s just like jenkins .
jenkins ?
no shit , jenkins too ?
he was sitting right next to me , hand to god .
and , louis , you should have seen his wife and kids
at the funeral .
funeral ?
yeah , you have kids , todd ?
yeah , i have two kids .
yeah , well , whether it &apos;s a heart attack or prison time ,
if you do not stop lying to us ,
they &apos;re never going to see their father again .
do you understand what i just said ?
you are never going to play soccer with them--
okay . okay ,
i am lying to you .
but please , you gotta help me .
well , we want to .
but , t @-@ dog , you gotta be straight up with your homies
if you want us to have your back .
the truth is , i &apos;m germaphobic .
i have to wash my hands throughout the day .
and they get dry , i mean really dry .
so i have to put on a lot of lotion .
and i know this sounds ridiculous ,
but my finger must have slipped on the keyboard , and i ,
i hit the wrong stock .
you &apos;re saying that you didn &apos;t even mean to buy that stock ?
nope , but then it skyrocketed ,
and i wasn &apos;t gonna tell everybody that i only bought it
because i suffer from dry skin .
please , you can &apos;t cut me loose .
i mean , i @-@ i can &apos;t go to prison .
unsanitary .
not that it &apos;s any of my business ,
but it was straight before .
i know .
oh , i get it .
look less together . get underestimated .
you gotta wave your hand slower .
thanks .
no problem .
if you want soap , you just click your heels together three times .
how do you think i &apos;m planning on getting that dryer to work ?
you know , you think you wouldn &apos;t have these problems ,
considering what you guys charge .
oh , no , i don &apos;t work here .
but you , uh--
i used to .
you &apos;re mike ross .
and you &apos;re logan sanders .
paper towel ?
don &apos;t mind if i do .
after you .
don &apos;t mind if i do .
i see you two have met .
we have .
and don &apos;t underestimate him because of his tie .
i have always estimated that tie correctly .
now , can we talk about business ?
depends on what you &apos;re proposing .
that you walk away .
that doesn &apos;t sound like much of a deal .
well , he forgot to add the part
where you walk away $ 20 million richer .
pure profit . no risk .
win @-@ win .
all right .
sounds good .
guess i just have one question .
what exactly are you going to do with this company ?
all due respect , i don &apos;t see how that &apos;s any of your concern .
all due respect , you &apos;re the one coming to me with an offer .
so if i say it &apos;s my concern , it is .
mike , you &apos;re asking about a competitor &apos;s business plan .
and if he wants to not be competitors ,
then he needs to answer my question .
okay , i &apos;ll tell you .
i &apos;m gonna do what anyone would and sell it for parts .
no deal .
okay , mike .
you win .
let &apos;s , uh , make it 30 million .
you could make it a billion , logan ,
and the answer is still gonna be the same .
&apos;cause i made a promise to walter gillis
that i would fight to keep his company alive .
and i don &apos;t think he &apos;s gonna believe that cutting a deal
to sell his workers out is keeping that promise .
i thought you said he was smart .
i am , which i why i know what &apos;s going on here .
what exactly is that ?
no one ever tells you no .
you &apos;re used to getting what you want .
but that &apos;s gonna stop right now .
you &apos;re right .
i do always get what i want .
i don &apos;t see how this time &apos;s gonna be any different .
i &apos;ll tell you how it &apos;s gonna be different .
this time you &apos;re talking about something that i care about .
so if you think i &apos;m gonna step aside and let you do--
yeah , i don &apos;t care if you step aside or not .
when i see something i want , i take it ,
and then i do whatever the hell i want with it .
and what i wanna do with this company is strip it down ,
flip it over--
okay , that &apos;s enough .
no , no , no , let him talk .
i wanna hear this . keep going , sanders .
no , i don &apos;t need to because you know how this ends .
yeah , i do , with me and walter gillis on one side
and you crying to your daddy on the other .
we &apos;re done .
you &apos;re right .
we are .
listen to me , the next time i say &quot; don &apos;t come to a meeting , &quot;
don &apos;t come to a meeting .
he came at me just as hard as--
i don &apos;t give a shit what he did .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me .
where are you going ?
to get you this company .
what are you talking about ?
weren &apos;t you listening ?
he just gave up his weak spot .
was that true about jenkins ?
i don &apos;t even know a jenkins .
but i do know todd &apos;s vein wasn &apos;t bulging .
and , louis , you were actually pretty good in there .
yeah , i was . and so were you .
so we &apos;re in agreement .
yeah , you don &apos;t completely suck .
i just meant that we should stick by todd smith .
that story was so ridiculous , it just might be true .
great , i &apos;ll call felton and make the recommendation .
well , hold up . you &apos;re gonna do what now ?
call my client ?
louis .
it may be your client , but it &apos;s still my case .
like hell it is , jeff .
okay . okay , you call .
oh , i plan to .
and when i do , i &apos;ll be telling them
that mr. slippery fingers is no longer our problem .
just one second ago , you said you believed him .
yeah , i also told you that his story was so ridiculous
and nobody would believe it .
well , then it &apos;s our job to make them believe it , louis ,
or this guy could wind up in prison .
he is not my concern , jeff .
felton securities is .
walter gillis knows what he &apos;s doing .
yeah , so do i.
he &apos;s letting your pension go unfunded ,
so he can hoard $ 1 billion .
no , that money is earmarked for expansion into asia .
and i believe in walter &apos;s vision .
you might , but do the workers you represent ?
you &apos;re acting as if our fund is empty .
i &apos;m acting as if it &apos;s 40 % full .
and let me guess , you &apos;re gonna fill up the rest .
someone else wants to acquire gillis &apos; company
before we can make an offer .
if you vote to block it ,
we will fully fund your pension the day we take over .
you &apos;re talking about me selling out my friend .
i &apos;m talking about $ 500 million .
and why can you fund it and they can &apos;t ?
well , they can with half that billion , but they won &apos;t .
because like i said , he &apos;s hoarding it for that pipe dream .
you &apos;re gonna take that billion for yourselves .
half .
the other half goes to you and your union--
the men walter gillis supposedly cares about .
pete , this is gonna happen whether it &apos;s me or someone else .
and someone else may not give you the chance to do
what you were elected to do :
protect your people .
how &apos;d your meeting with harvey go today ?
i thought talking about work was against the rules .
talking about work is . talking about our day isn &apos;t .
i mean , if we can &apos;t do that , then we &apos;re letting the case
come between us , right ?
my meeting with harvey went fine .
but you didn &apos;t take the deal .
because it wasn &apos;t a good deal .
fine .
okay , what &apos;s the matter with you ?
what &apos;s the matter is that i heard what happened .
from him ?
no , from donna .
but it could have been from any of the 50 people
who saw the two of you going at it .
rachel -- - just tell me this .
did you refuse the deal because it wasn &apos;t good enough
or because it came from logan ?
you think i didn &apos;t take this deal
because of your history with this asshole ?
well , you did just call him an asshole .
he &apos;s an asshole because he &apos;s willing to decimate a company
just to put some money in his pocket .
look , i gave my word to walter gillis .
that &apos;s what i told harvey and what i told logan
and what i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d have to tell you .
i &apos;m just saying , all of this could have been over today .
you think i don &apos;t want this to be over ?
i do .
but i can &apos;t take that deal .
and we said we wouldn &apos;t let this come between us .
so don &apos;t .
hi , donna .
hey , louis .
what can i do for you ?
oh , well , i just came in
to bring you this and this
and
all of these .
those are the last seven todd smiths you evaluated .
donna--
seven .
and you didn &apos;t cut one of them loose .
you heard me and malone .
i did .
and you &apos;re cutting this guy loose just to spite him .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
okay , so this has nothing to do with malone ?
nothing .
where &apos;d you get that ?
come on . you know where i got it .
louis ...
i know he took your dream .
i mean , she didn &apos;t even consider me .
just brings him in , had me train him ,
and gives him the corner office .
hey , did i ever tell you about the time that i auditioned
for hamlet in college ?
obviously , you played ophelia .
no , chrissy kiff did .
i was her understudy ,
and i was so jealous .
i found myself wishing that something would happen to her ,
that she would get sick or she would twist an ankle .
and then , the day before we closed ...
her father died .
donna , that wasn &apos;t your fault .
but i still felt horrible
and ashamed
&apos;cause my jealousy had brought out something really ugly in me .
and as you can tell , i still regret that .
you know you &apos;ve never told me a story about yourself like that before .
i &apos;ve never told anyone that story before .
louis , i know how badly you wanted this .
but this is a man &apos;s life .
we won &apos;t cut him loose .
i &apos;ll tell malone .
i &apos;m proud of you , louis .
did you get an offer to walk away from your takeover ?
i did .
what was the offer ?
$ 30 million .
and you turned it down ? what the hell is wrong with you ?
they &apos;re gonna rip the company apart .
i don &apos;t care if they wanna use walter gillis &apos; head
as a paperweight .
you said you wanted a grand slam .
that offer is a double .
well , i &apos;d rather have a double than nothing .
look , i know what i am doing here .
do you ?
because they just flipped the head of the union .
and without his vote , we don &apos;t have shit .
what ?
these guys play to win .
they just promised $ 1 / 2 @-@ billion donation to their pension fund .
and unless walter gillis is gonna match it ,
we &apos;re done .
yeah .
that &apos;s what i thought .
you get that $ 30 million ,
or you find yourself another job .
donna , did you need something ?
no , but louis does .
he was planning to pitch you that he take on jeff malone
before you and harvey even met him .
he saw woodall coming before we did ?
and if he won ,
he was hoping that that would mean name partner .
i empathize with that , donna . i do .
but i have to make decisions based on what &apos;s best for the firm .
and i &apos;m not here to change your mind ,
but maybe if you did something else for louis--
such as ?
giving him the corner office .
you mean jeff malone &apos;s office ?
he could move to louis &apos; .
i appreciate you letting me know about louis ,
but i &apos;m not going to do that .
well , why not ? jeff malone just got here .
because i said so . now if you &apos;ll excuse me--
you &apos;re sleeping with him .
what ?
of course .
that glow , the morning meetings , you had harvey take your lunch .
how could i miss it ? i &apos;m losing my edge .
donna , there is nothing going on between--
you &apos;re not losing your edge .
but i ended my relationship with jeff malone
the day that i hired him .
and i respect that .
but you said you make decisions
based on what &apos;s best for the firm .
isn &apos;t giving louis his dignity back good for the firm ?
hey , i got your message .
usually when someone wants to talk business--
i want to take your offer .
mike , that offer &apos;s gone .
and what if i told you i &apos;d take less ?
i &apos;d say i can &apos;t give you less .
come on , you &apos;re the guy who settles .
i &apos;m telling you i wanna settle .
you &apos;re telling me you have to settle .
and i know that you can get that offer back .
it &apos;s not my job to get it back .
and even if it was , you think he &apos;s gonna give you a nickel
after what you said to him ?
what i said to him ? what about what he said to me ?
i don &apos;t care what he said to you .
i gave you a way out ,
and you insisted on going to that meeting .
you didn &apos;t do that for me . you did that for your client .
what difference does it make ? it was a win @-@ goddamn @-@ win .
and you shit all over it .
now i &apos;m saying , i &apos;ll take it .
yeah , well , it doesn &apos;t work that way .
i &apos;m here as a courtesy .
you &apos;re only here because you lost .
harvey , i &apos;m--
enough .
that company &apos;s fate is sealed . it always has been .
and the next time you walk away from the table ,
be prepared to walk away from the table .
wanna pour me one of those ?
help yourself .
so what &apos;s going on with mike ross ?
how do you know i &apos;m thinking about mike ross ?
who else would it be ?
he got you on the ropes ?
no , i got him .
and he &apos;s about to go down .
how do you know ?
&apos;cause the only way to stay in the game
is to get walter gillis to give up his dream .
and you don &apos;t think he has the stomach
to rip off the arm to save the body .
no , he doesn &apos;t .
you don &apos;t seem to feel good about that .
no , i don &apos;t .
harvey .
do you remember when i gave you the collins case ?
yeah .
it was brutal , what we had to do .
it was my first taste of that kind of thing .
and you loved it .
what &apos;s your point ?
some people love the taste of blood .
other people , hmm .
better to find out who you are sooner than later .
you saying i &apos;m doing him a favor ?
i &apos;m saying , you &apos;re being who you are
and letting him be who he is .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m just thinking about how much
i &apos;m going to miss having my own office .
put your pride away , okay ? you can still go back to harvey .
i went back to harvey .
the money &apos;s off the table .
then you have to flip that vote .
the only way to do that is to get walter gillis
to put $ 500 million into that pension fund .
and if he does that , he loses his expansion .
mike , then do it .
amy , when his son died , this company became his family .
if he doesn &apos;t expand , then his company &apos;s gonna die too .
i ask him to do that , then i &apos;m no better than logan .
no , you are better , because after you do this ,
you &apos;re still gonna fight to keep them alive .
gillis is not gonna see it that way .
he &apos;s just gonna see some slick banker
who sold him a bill of goods just to end up doing
what everybody else was at least up front about .
then why don &apos;t you just pack up your shit
and crawl out of here with your tail between your legs ?
because if you don &apos;t have the stomach to handle this ,
then you don &apos;t belong here .
hey , uh , got your message .
is there something wrong with felton securities ?
not at all .
oh , thank god .
i just assumed since you wanted to meet here in malone &apos;s office .
oh , this isn &apos;t his office anymore .
oh , did he get fired ?
no , but he is moving .
louis , i know it hasn &apos;t always been easy for you
to embrace new partners ,
but you &apos;ve made a great effort with jeff .
all in a day &apos;s work .
and your day &apos;s work has benefited this firm for years .
so we thought it was time to show you
a little overdue appreciation .
this office ?
i gave this office to jeff
because i wanted him to feel valued here .
but the truth is , i-- i should have given it to you .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
oh , okay .
all right , let it out .
no way .
pete kreeling would never side with them .
he would , and he has ,
because they offered what you couldn &apos;t--
security for his workers .
they &apos;re my goddamn workers .
then show them that you care about them .
fund the pension , and fund it now .
you told me you &apos;d fight to keep this from happening .
i told you i would fight to protect your company .
and right now , this is the best way of doing that .
you &apos;re talking about using my expansion money .
if you don &apos;t use it now ,
there &apos;s gonna be nothing to expand .
you son of a bitch , you manipulated me .
no , i told you a war was coming
and that you needed a war chest .
well , now is the time to crack it open .
you told me what i wanted to hear to get me on your side .
you &apos;re the same as them .
you &apos;re wrong . i looked you in the eye ,
and i told you that i wanted to save your company .
they looked me in the eye
and told me they wanted to rip it apart .
you &apos;re the same as them !
and you &apos;re an naive old man having a tantrum
because he &apos;s not getting his way !
that expansion was my dream .
i know .
but now it &apos;s time to wake up .
fund the pension , walter .
pete kreeling &apos;s vote stays in our favor , and ...
we live to fight another day .
no .
i just wanted to thank you , you know , for the new office .
it &apos;s a downgrade .
not to me .
i also wanted to thank you for lunch .
i didn &apos;t show up for lunch .
i know.you thought you were sending me a message .
i was sending you a message .
not the one you wanted , jessica .
you see , because what i heard is that
you don &apos;t trust yourself around me .
if i didn &apos;t ,
i wouldn &apos;t have put you right next door .
jessica , say what you will ,
but we both know where this is headed--
you and me watching these .
you think you know me that well ?
well , if i don &apos;t ,
i &apos;m about to .
neighbor .
more . more . more . ah , ah .
thank you .
happy corner office .
open it .
is this ...
me .
as ophelia .
but i thought you--
yeah , well ,
sometimes bitter memories
become bittersweet
when you share them with a friend .
you here to pick up rachel ?
no .
no , i just came by to say thanks .
for what ?
for not giving me a way out .
you funded the pension .
100 % .
you just got rid of half your war chest .
maybe ,
but i also did what you thought i couldn &apos;t do .
i got the vote back .
maybe now you &apos;ll realize that i &apos;m willing to go the distance .
all you did was make it to round two .
oh , so you thought
this was gonna be like one of those early tyson fights ,
the ones that only lasted 45 seconds .
remember what happened the first time
someone made it out of round one ?
第一个打败泰森的拳手 但只昙花一现
and what ever did happen to buster douglas ?
i don &apos;t know , but wherever he is ,
they can &apos;t take that title away from him .
what you working on ?
you know what i &apos;m working on .
you wanna go home ?
harvey .
guess that means you &apos;re gonna be working late , huh ?
thanks to the guy we &apos;re up against .
he is proving to be much tougher than everyone expected .
everyone ?
not everyone .
he sounds like a real douche bag .
you know , he &apos;s not that tough .
i can work on this tomorrow .
let &apos;s get out of here .
you really gonna work on that tomorrow ?
no , i &apos;m going to work on it later tonight ,
but at least i &apos;ll be home .
think i can take a look at it when you &apos;re done ?
i think not .
just a proofread ?
ah , still no .
