peter , you have the right to remain silent .
curtis hagen . what &apos;s your offer ?
i know how to make peter burke a free man .
coins , minted from welsh gold .
i can make a believable facsimile of james &apos;s voice .
i shot and killed senator terrance pratt
using peter burke &apos;s gun .
with this evidence in hand , i see no other option
than to drop all charges .
mr. burke , you are free to go .
i think the gold was used to bribe
the federal prosecutor on peter &apos;s case .
you figured out what i want yet ?
the mosconi codex .
you &apos;re gonna steal it for me .
if this book is a puzzle ,
maybe these are the pieces .
i know that the codex leads to the window .
isn &apos;t it lucky you were already planning to steal it for me ?
but there &apos;s something you should know about me .
i &apos;m not an fbi agent .
i &apos;m a criminal informant .
morning .
morning .
again .
there you are .
oh , don &apos;t worry , they delete the audio every 24 hours .
audio ?
i thought you said it was only a tracking--
oh , you are gonna pay for that .
oh , yeah ?
you pick up some moves in that moroccan jail ?
maybe .
i would love to go back , but the world &apos;s too big
to go back to the same place twice ,
don &apos;t you think ?
the world used to be my oyster .
now , i know every oyster bar in my two @-@ mile radius .
two miles .
that means you can never come to my place .
look ...
my life is complicated .
is that too much for you ?
no .
i didn &apos;t like you because you were a fbi agent .
no ?
no .
i liked you because you were smart
and marginally easy on the eyes .
and then , there was the codex .
speaking of , can i ask you something ?
you wanna know why
i &apos;m investigating chapter 13 .
well , if it &apos;s not for the bureau ...
when you &apos;re a criminal ,
you get to know other criminals .
my friend was in a lot of trouble ,
and the only person who could help him
was a really bad guy ,
and the payment was chapter 13 .
so i stole it .
and you made a copy .
to find out why he wanted it .
that was the right answer because that means
that this can still be undone .
i mean , do you think the original pages are safe ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure .
so it &apos;s possible that they could be returned ?
i mean , after we figure out why mosconi wrote
the chapter 13 in the first place
and what the stained glass window
has to do with all of it ...
rebecca , um ... i just--
i think it &apos;s best if we distance you
from all of this .
oh . why ?
the guy i gave that chapter to
is not someone you wanna know .
trust me .
right .
of course , of course . i @-@ i trust you .
my temp job calls .
oh . you knock now .
oh , i had enough of an inkling
about what might have transpired last evening
to require a drink tray .
oh , you showed her your anklet .
and then you showed her your anklet again .
that &apos;s not a euphemism . you &apos;re wearing a robe .
i told rebecca everything .
abridged-- nothing about you ,
and very little about hagen .
what about stealing the--macchiato ?
thanks , agent gruetzner .
never caught your first name .
mozzie , short for &quot; mozart . &quot;
no further questions . that &apos;s all you &apos;ll ever know .
i can &apos;t believe i thought you worked for the fbi .
apology accepted .
you look nice , by the way .
merci .
i have a lunch .
i better go .
everything okay ?
yeah .
you two have fun doing ...
things .
morning .
morning , jones .
i just came back from a pawn shop .
finally decided to unload
your action figure collection ?
never . we got a call from the owner .
the watch list ?
i knew this day would come .
i never thought this particular day would come .
what , that we &apos;d be outside a bastion of the masons ,
planning to heist a very old , highly fragile
200 @-@ pound stained glass window ?
well , give or take , depending on the lead content .
crafted by mosconi in 1887 .
yeah , right before he died .
or was killed .
it &apos;s a big job for two people .
are you implying that we may need help ?
no , i &apos;m just saying we have backup ,
if we need her .
as devoted as rare books becca is
to our cause , we don &apos;t have time
for third wheels or--
training wheels . i know .
once we figure out what hagen wants with it ,
we can loop her back in .
is it possible he &apos;s making us dance
just for his amusement ?
he &apos;s not easily amused .
let &apos;s focus more on the &quot; how &quot;
before we get bogged down on the &quot; why . &quot;
step one .
modified six @-@ finger .
very precise .
the co2 cartridge gives you the juice .
well , you can &apos;t replace a pane in a window that old
without removing the whole thing .
the church will call a glass repair service .
i &apos;ll keep an eye on the place .
when they set up the scaffolding
to reach the window ...
we &apos;ll make our move .
good .
look what turned up today .
peter ...
this is a welsh gold coin .
yup .
i think it &apos;s one of the ones stolen
through that travel agency .
yeah , i &apos;d put money on it .
where &apos;d it come from ?
a pawn shop .
someone came in to sell it .
did the owner give you a name ?
patience .
something tells me that &apos;s not a name .
it always pays off
because the criminal always messes up .
it always comes around to bite them .
must be our lucky day .
luck had nothing to do with it .
i put those coins on an fbi watch list .
this was my first case after prison ,
my last case as a field agent .
oh , i remember .
and now we have a lead .
i &apos;m not gonna stop until i catch the thief
who stole that gold .
well , the suspect dressed up as fdny ,
broke through the wall to access the vault
and steal the coins .
this is our shot to recover
a 1.8 million in rare gold .
and we &apos;re operating under the assumption
that this is part of a larger batch that went missing .
i think our thief was testing the waters .
what do you think , neal ?
i &apos;d float one coin . wait to see what happens .
it could be .
did the pawn shop owner get an i.d. ?
they did .
sister minnie o &apos;malley .
she swiped it from the collection basket .
you look surprised .
so does she .
how many hail marys will that get her ?
oh , the sister &apos;s not the only one
with sticky fingers .
this coin has been stolen more
than second base at a cubs game .
we followed the coin &apos;s trail ,
questioned the parishioners who were at st. magnus &apos;s last sunday .
susan barrett made the donation
after she found it in her son &apos;s sock drawer .
turns out her son abe
stole it from a cash @-@ for @-@ gold shop .
set off the alarm , but the owner of the shop
didn &apos;t want to file a report when nypd got there .
probably gets his product primarily from fences .
exactly .
these three are known for trafficking precious metals .
find the fence , lean on them
to reveal who brought in the coin .
now , while all appear to have dealings with the owner ,
we may be looking for someone outside our radar .
anyone you want to add to that list , caffrey ?
i &apos;ll hit the streets . see what i can find .
good . that &apos;s it .
neal , hold up .
i want to go with you .
look , if it is someone new , it &apos;s because they &apos;re good .
they hear the fbi &apos;s sniffin &apos; around ,
they &apos;ll go underground .
fair enough .
make it fast .
all right .
neal ?
uh , while you &apos;re you &apos;re pounding your pavement ,
i &apos;m assuming mozzie has connections
with these type of fences .
i &apos;ll talk to him , but he has a lunch .
a lunch ?
if i interrupt it for fbi business ,
squealing on a fence will be right below
joining facebook on his to @-@ do list .
see ya .
hey , hon .
i know you have lunch plans .
yeah , but i need to swing by your office .
hey ! can you break a hundred ?
sorry , pal .
fives , tens , whatever you got .
i &apos;ll even take welsh gold .
i &apos;m due in court--
$ 1.8 million .
less one coin , that is still a lot of money .
the fbi &apos;s trackin &apos; that coin .
when they find your fence , and they will ,
he &apos;s gonna point to you .
look , i know you took a bribe
to drop the indictment of peter burke .
you &apos;re harassing a u.s. attorney .
i want your name , so i can charge you with slander .
oh , yeah , sure . it &apos;s neal caffrey .
i &apos;m agent burke &apos;s criminal informant .
i &apos;m also an associate of curtis hagen ,
and i stole the coins you were paid with .
tell me who you brought that coin to .
i can run interference .
why implicate yourself ?
mutually @-@ assured destruction &apos;s a powerful motivator .
i need a name .
i ...
come on , you worked at treasury .
you didn &apos;t think welsh gold
would be hard to unload ?
i was presented with a dollar figure .
so it was hagen &apos;s idea to pay you in coins .
and who to go to , to unload the--
he said it would be safe .
if you don &apos;t give me a name , nobody is safe .
你在哪儿
我到了 你在哪儿
鞋子不错 回头看
el told me about your bat phone
since day one .
i should have known she &apos;d choose you .
i have questions .
hey , it &apos;s neal .
listen , i need estelle .
no , right now .
i am under no obligation to provide answers .
in fact , as a citizen of this great country ,
you actually work for me .
well , let &apos;s get the irs on the phone ,
see how much you &apos;ve chipped in for my salary .
i may have time to entertain a query or two .
who do you know that fences high @-@ end metals ?
platinum , gold , copper ?
i am neither informant nor rat .
diana &apos;s doing well .
so is little theo .
i &apos;d hate to break up that maternal bliss
and ask her about the teddy winters case .
that would be unfortunate .
you have a name ?
dekker . in the flower district .
he traffics metals ?
sure .
let &apos;s go with that .
his front is the one with the tulip sign .
that &apos;s fresh .
karl dekker .
runs a stall at the flower market .
flowers imported daily from all over the world .
trucks in and out .
yeah . if you &apos;re gonna deal in illegal goods ,
it &apos;s a smart front .
adjusting exchange rates
means messy books .
good way to hide money .
never been busted for fencing
but was arrested for an arms trade a few years back .
yeah , he served the minimum
after flipping on the buyer and the seller .
good , that means if we apply the right pressure ,
he &apos;ll tell us who brought him the coin .
well , it looks like caffrey came through .
mm , no . this was my intel .
well , maybe he &apos;ll walk in with the exact same lead .
or maybe he won &apos;t .
imagine my surprise when fair estelle
descended with your message .
well , you &apos;re not answering your phones .
shh , the panic in your voice
is causing her feathers to ruffle .
her brain is the size of a raisin .
au revoir , ma belle !
all right .
dawson moved one of the coins we stole for hagen ,
and it turned up on peter &apos;s desk .
do you know a fence named karl dekker ?
moz , come on . peter is on our heels .
no , we &apos;re on his .
he crashed my lunch . i put him on dekker &apos;s trail .
all right , then we need to get to him .
if peter gets to dekker first
and dekker points to dawson--
dawson might admit to taking a bribe ,
but they can &apos;t connect it back to you .
yes , they can .
that &apos;s how i got dekker &apos;s name .
and if he somehow crumples
under the suits &apos; verbal waterboarding--
peter &apos;s indicted , and i &apos;ll end up in prison .
i had a falling out with dekker .
he got the flower district .
if he sees me , he &apos;ll chase after me
with his pruning sheers .
okay , then i &apos;ll go in alone .
which shop is it ?
the new amsterdam garden center ,
the one with the tulips .
and that &apos;s what you told peter ?
well , even under duress , i didn &apos;t tell him everything .
it &apos;s the red one .
what are you doin &apos; here ?
what i told you .
running down a fence .
karl dekker .
that &apos;s our guy .
this is our location .
new amsterdam garden center .
the sign with the tulip .
let &apos;s go .
peter , uh ...
i really think it &apos;s best if i approach dekker alone .
nope .
no , if there &apos;s a lead on who fenced that coin ,
i want it firsthand .
all right .
i &apos;m gonna kill him .
what ?
there are three signs with a tulip .
yellow , red , pink .
did your source tell you which color ?
of course he didn &apos;t . did yours ?
i say we start with red .
red it is .
hold on .
what , you &apos;re reconsidering the red tulip ?
so what if i am ?
let &apos;s go check out the yellow ones .
no .
okay , that leaves pink .
i know what that leaves us with .
a dozen long @-@ stems , thorns clipped off .
this stays airtight .
i make sure of that .
hello ?
what the hell ?
who the hell--
get the hell out , now .
the fbi is storming the gates .
feds . this a set @-@ up ?
i don &apos;t know . is it ?
look , why don &apos;t we split up ?
i &apos;ll take yellow . you can take pink .
i @-@ i &apos;ll take pink . you take yellow .
red .
we &apos;re back to red .
yes .
okay .
gentlemen , we must move .
time usually marches . but in this case , she sprints .
i &apos;m gonna crush your larynx with a 12 @-@ gauge wire .
i &apos;m gonna pretend you didn &apos;t say that ,
and you are not leaving here with a dozen long @-@ stems .
i &apos;ll give you a choice .
bleach and a body bag , or that backdoor .
hey , look , viceroy tulips .
you should buy some for elizabeth .
maybe on the way out .
every time you show up , you cost me money .
dekker , just put it down .
follow me .
we interrupted a deal .
ak @-@ 47 . serial &apos;s burned off .
ammo disguised as seeds .
wait a minute . i know those shoes .
those are mozzie &apos;s shoes .
how much did switching shoes with that guy cost you ?
oh , a benjamin franklin and exposure to athlete &apos;s foot .
at least they &apos;re comfortable .
yeah , well , peter &apos;s not happy .
oh , and now i have carte blanche
to the flower district .
the universe has achieved equilibrium .
the scaffolding is up ?
yeah , sanderson glass reports
to the church at 7 : 00 a.m.
my recon tells me
they get their caffeine fix at 9 : 00 .
yeah , well , once we &apos;re up in the scaffolding ,
we &apos;re exposed .
front and side exits are weak spots .
we won &apos;t have long .
well , we &apos;ll figure it out .
look , ever since i left this morning ,
i &apos;ve been thinking about the window
and the codex and us--
come on in .
hey , mozzie .
good evening .
that--the sketch .
it wasn &apos;t here earlier .
did you just draw that ?
of course it was .
you guys have a plan for the window .
we were working on it .
i @-@ i &apos;m gonna go , uh , soak my feet
in tea tree oil .
you do that .
you were thinking ?
i--
i was .
i still am .
i said i understood why you need to go ahead
on the codex without me , but i actually don &apos;t .
believe me when i say
it &apos;s for your own good .
that book brought us together .
things are getting exciting .
i want to be part of it .
i want to be part of this part of your life .
mozzie and i are stealing the stained glass .
it &apos;s a crime .
you &apos;re not a criminal ,
and i don &apos;t want to turn you into one .
the only reason i know that
is because i found the schematic .
i was gonna share the window with you once i had it .
neal , what was the point of all that honesty last night
if you &apos;re just gonna keep secrets from me ?
i wanted you to know who i am .
and now , i want to protect you from who i am .
i don &apos;t need protecting .
but i do want to know one thing .
what ?
now that you have what you want ,
the chapter 13 , some mosconi insight ,
me ...
never mind .
i know the answer .
you got everything you wanted .
come on .
it &apos;s not like that .
it feels like that .
look , um , it &apos;s gonna be dangerous in the dark
for you and for the windows , so just be careful .
it won &apos;t be dark .
we &apos;re stealing it tomorrow morning .
really ?
while the repairmen take their coffee break .
but--
the scream was stolen during the day , twice .
mona lisa too .
how long will that take ?
we haven &apos;t timed it out yet .
but how do you know you &apos;ll be able
to pull it off before the workers get back ?
why do i feel like these are leading questions ?
what if you let me help ?
i told you i don &apos;t want you--
nothing illegal .
i could be a lookout or a distraction ,
just so that you and mozzie have the window you need .
to steal the window .
admit it .
it would help .
it would , actually .
so ?
you &apos;re in .
yeah .
i came so close to getting dekker yesterday .
we seized a flower shop full of guns ...
but not the man behind it all .
mm . i &apos;m sorry , honey .
it &apos;s probably payback for using your wife &apos;s
not @-@ so @-@ secret phone to track mozzie .
mozzie , i get .
it &apos;s neal and those welsh gold coins .
you really think he stole them ?
it would explain why they didn &apos;t want me to get to dekker .
i don &apos;t know , stealing the money
just to take it , and then selling it to a weapons @-@ dealing fence
just doesn &apos;t seem like neal .
well , a lot doesn &apos;t add up on this one .
$ 2 million missing from the summers investigation ,
and that fbi pen that i found at the chiropractor &apos;s office ,
the one where neal was .
it &apos;s dekker .
he &apos;s the last straw .
hey . asac burke .
you know , the last time you became suspicious ,
it ended up being about a woman .
it &apos;s never just about a woman .
a lovely woman ,
the first one in a really long time
that neal &apos;s been interested in .
he &apos;s back .
where ?
16th and rutherford .
now you know where he is .
yeah .
all right . the window &apos;s out .
all we have to do is get in there ,
lower it down--
and roll away with it ,
avoiding the cameras on that stop light ,
that church , and that garage .
the city &apos;s becoming a modern @-@ day panopticon .
easy , bentham . that &apos;s a rant for another day .
there go the repairmen on their coffee break .
rebecca , are you sure about this ?
yeah .
these are my favorites .
gotta sell it , right ?
see you on the other side .
see you .
you go , girl .
what ?
i &apos;ve always wanted to say that .
no . no , no , no .
excuse me .
could you help me ?
i--my earring fell down the drain .
it was my grandmother &apos;s .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s all that i have left of hers .
yeah , but--forget it .
no , you know what ? it &apos;s fine .
go , go . i @-@ i &apos;m sure that i can lift this .
listen .
step aside , baby girl .
i got this .
really ?
in the crate .
clamp it shut .
bungee cord .
and we lower her down slowly .
you guys done in there yet ?
whoa . someone &apos;s headed our way .
right uniforms , wrong faces .
i &apos;ll occupy him .
how ?
i &apos;ll ask him a question that he &apos;ll be compelled to answer .
i &apos;m in need of a sanctuary .
look , try the hare krishna &apos;s over in boerum hill .
they &apos;ll give you lunch . now , excuse me .
i need to check on a window repair .
oh , how rude of me .
blaine rockford .
on the level .
on the square .
that handshake .
you &apos;re of the 33rd order .
who will help the widow &apos;s son ?
oh , come with me , brother .
you are safe .
so , mr. rockford , you are welcome
to wait here as long as you need .
oh , no , thanks . i &apos;m quite recovered .
dehydration led to an acute bout of paranoia .
is it possible for me to procure some more of this holy swill ?
well , it &apos;s not--
the widow &apos;s son is parched .
got it .
ohh . here you go .
i guess i picked the right guys for the job .
the least i can do is buy you guys some coffee .
nah , we gotta get back .
oh , really ?
hey , did you get that smile from your grandma too ?
everybody says so .
i bet .
here we go .
hey , let &apos;s get going .
all right .
okay . go .
you got it ?
dare i say we pulled it off ?
as long as you walk under a ladder
and step on a crack at the same time .
i think maybe we pulled it off .
what &apos;s goin &apos; on ?
it &apos;s gone .
what is ?
the window . it &apos;s gone .
who &apos;d steal a window from a church ?
i got a pretty good idea .
when you were on a break , you didn &apos;t see anybody ?
no .
peter ?
i work with him .
he works for me . thanks , guys .
what &apos;s goin &apos; on ?
somebody stole that window .
that &apos;s weird .
very .
the church called the fbi about a stolen window ?
no , they did not .
i was in the area .
you pulled my tracking .
puts you here on a regular basis .
you caught me .
what &apos;s that ?
well , if a croissant and a donut
give each other a very special hug ...
you come here for food ?
oh , it &apos;s more like a controlled substance .
yeah , the shop &apos;s right around the corner .
here , take it .
i &apos;ll go stand in line for another .
no , hold on .
yeah , jones .
that is interesting . i &apos;m on my way .
what &apos;s interesting ?
something jones found .
well , i &apos;ll come with you . i like interesting .
nah , go buy yourself another croissant @-@ donut thingy .
the same corner we followed him to ?
yeah . when i got there , someone had stolen
a stained glass window from a church .
stained glass window .
i got nothin &apos; . what did caffrey say ?
he blamed it on the pastry ,
which i add to my venn diagram of loose ends
along with the welsh gold .
well , this place is another kind of gold mine .
it looks like dekker was a middleman
for a major arms deal .
poppies equal pistols . ranunculus equal revolvers .
freesias equal .45s.
and he left something else behind .
unmarked bills .
and krugerrands and antique silver .
hard to track , like welsh coins .
leave everything here and clear out .
dekker ran away without his emergency stash .
good chance he &apos;ll come back for it .
i &apos;ll gear up for some quality time in the van .
if he does , we &apos;ll get him .
call me at 7 : 30 with an update .
what if there &apos;s nothing to report ?
call me anyway .
7 : 30 sharp .
saved you half .
coming !
hey , peter .
do you want to come in ?
i want answers .
you looking for something ?
yeah . about $ 2 million in gold coins .
you won &apos;t find &apos; em here .
you &apos;re not that sloppy .
you really think i took them .
there was a moment when you were alone
upstairs in that firehouse .
and why else wouldn &apos;t you want me
to go with you to talk to dekker ?
i told you he would spook ,
and look what happened .
yeah , jones . what do you have ?
7 : 30 , like you said .
no sign of dekker .
great . bring him in .
i want him to sweat .
no , peter .
i said , &quot; no sign of dekker . &quot;
i want him ready to sing when i get there .
you got it .
dekker .
you got him ?
what &apos;d i tell you ?
criminals always mess up .
come on .
time to find out who has those gold coins .
neal ?
let &apos;s go .
we can &apos;t .
because you stole them .
it &apos;s not what you think .
neal , you impersonated a fireman ,
and you robbed a vault under my watch .
i can explain , all right ?
don &apos;t ! don &apos;t you dare try to justify what you did !
i put myself out on the line for you , all the time !
i helped your father .
i was charged for murder because of it .
will you please--
i nearly lost everything--
i did it for you !
what are you talkin &apos; about ?
to make sure dawson would authenticate the confession .
my prosecutor ?
he took a bribe .
you couldn &apos;t find james , could you ?
i tried .
so you forged his voice ,
and i was cleared on false evidence .
look , even if you were found innocent ,
indictment would have ended your career at the fbi
because of me .
because of my father .
i couldn &apos;t let that happen to you .
neal , do you realize what you have done ?
yeah .
i made sure justice was served .
no .
that &apos;s what i do .
put out your hands .
i have to arrest you .
i &apos;ll do the time ,
but you think about it , peter ,
what this will do to your life ,
to elizabeth .
i did the right thing .
none of this is right .
okay , so you just , uh , left neal at his apartment ?
he &apos;s not goin &apos; anywhere .
if i book him , this all goes on record .
i just needed to talk to you first because--
because what ?
because there &apos;s no way out of this .
well , there has to be .
honey , neal committed a crime .
dawson accepted a bribe , and i know about it .
i don &apos;t even deserve the badge to arrest them .
i &apos;ve been promoted .
i &apos;m being groomed for d.c. none of this is real .
whoa , whoa , wait . all of this is real .
i mean , all of this is deserved .
honey , you-- you turned them in .
your case is gonna be reopened .
i &apos;ll be indicted ,
there will be a murder trial , and i &apos;ll lose my job .
no , that &apos;s not justice .
you &apos;re--you &apos;re innocent .
why should we lose everything ?
ah , this is all my fault .
i asked neal to do whatever he could to help you .
honey , neal broke the law . you didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m glad he did .
i can &apos;t condone this .
i believe in the system . always have .
what does it say about me if i let this go ?
it says that you &apos;re a man
who stays and fixes what &apos;s broken .
it says you &apos;re a man who understands
the letter of the law is subjective .
i &apos;m sorry .
i swore i &apos;d never put you through this again .
are you willing to give up everything we &apos;ve built ?
i need to be able to live with myself .
then do what you have to do ,
but just be damn sure that you need to do it .
you were right .
dekker came back for the money .
he was not at all happy to see me .
well , i &apos;m sure .
peter , i didn &apos;t ask him about the welsh gold yet .
why not ?
well , &apos; cause he should get serious time
for the weapons charge .
i mean , dekker &apos;s cut deals before .
he &apos;ll try to plead down the guns--
yeah , we can keep the coins as leverage .
all right .
you want me to go in there with you ?
no . you made the bust .
you take it .
all right .
you didn &apos;t have dekker last night .
no , but i knew we &apos;d get him .
misinformation .
it &apos;s an acceptable method of extracting a confession .
sometimes the ends do justify the means .
i &apos;m gonna tell dawson that i know he took a bribe .
if you--
i know what it means .
you want me to go with you ?
no .
mr. dawson .
agent burke .
what brings you here ?
i &apos;m investigating a federal prosecutor .
he took a $ 1.8 million bribe from my criminal informant .
you can spare me the look of surprise .
i don &apos;t like what you &apos;re insinuating .
then you &apos;re really not gonna like this .
i have karl dekker in custody ,
the fence you used to liquidate the welsh gold .
i hope you can substantiate this .
i can . my c.i. talked .
i know everything .
mutually @-@ assured destruction .
turn in the coins to the fbi anonymously and resign .
and if i don &apos;t ?
turn in the coins and resign ,
or i arrest you right now .
i hope you can live with that ultimatum .
either way .
you think peter will cuff dawson ?
well , he hasn &apos;t yet , or i &apos;d be in a cell .
peter can &apos;t ever know that hagen was behind that bribe .
or that we &apos;re the reason the dutchman made his appeal .
or that there &apos;s evidence of me stealing the coins .
we are running out of time .
i have to hand over this window to hagen by--
that &apos;s kind of a crime unto itself .
did we really need to take it apart ?
well , if we really want to find out
why this is so important ,
we have to open up our minds .
actually , we still have some good--
no more hallucinogens , dr. leary .
free association , then .
um , purple . go .
okay . color .
color in stained glass comes from metallic salts ,
copper oxide , cobalt , gold .
metal .
another word for stained glass is &quot; lead light . &quot;
maybe the iron framework is a map .
the concept of stained glass
was never to see the world outside .
or to admit light .
it was to control it ,
to use it to reveal something .
but what ?
a question only a masonic @-@ italian expatriate
mad genius trained in painting , metallurgy ,
and engineering can answer .
hold on a second .
look at this .
that &apos;s mosconi &apos;s signature .
how did it get there ?
this blue pane .
a decoder lens .
let me see .
no , it only works on this one .
mosconi made this window and hid his name in it ,
along with the decoder .
it doesn &apos;t work on ours .
because it &apos;s a copy .
that &apos;s why he needed--
neal , you asked me to trust you .
you can trust me .
the man of questionable character
i told you about ?
his name is curtis hagen ,
and he &apos;s holding incriminating evidence over me .
a damocles &apos; sword , if you will .
and now we know he needs this to decode chapter 13 .
we had to give him the original .
but without that glass , he &apos;ll never know the secret .
we can turn the tables .
so what &apos;s the plan ?
leverage the decoder for the evidence tape .
then you &apos;ll be free .
or not . depends on peter .
yeah , caffrey ?
you heard from peter ?
not since yesterday . why ?
he &apos;s late . he &apos;s never late .
well , there must be a reason .
must be .
i got a tip on the welsh gold .
it checked out .
jones , put a team together .
my office , now .
every time .
i &apos;m glad it &apos;s you , not me .
thanks .
the coins are in a safety deposit box
at a bank downtown .
andrew dawson no longer works
for the department of justice .
what about you ?
i &apos;m still here .
look , you arrested a dangerous fence ,
recovered the gold , took down a dirty prosecutor .
it &apos;s a win .
it &apos;s a compromise ,
one i will never make again .
i know why you did what you did .
yeah .
to help my friend .
and because you &apos;re a criminal ,
and you can &apos;t help yourself .
shame on me for expecting anything else .
things are gonna change
for the both of us .
yeah .
it &apos;s time they did .
