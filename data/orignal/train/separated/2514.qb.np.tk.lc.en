birthplace of the brass knuckle ,
the nigerian prince scam ,
and putting a tomato on your grilled cheese sandwich .
our story begins not long ago ...
on what seemed like a typical day .
ralphie , please .

aw , he &apos;s a dumb kid , but he &apos;s an above @-@ average dog .
roll over , son .
yay ! aw , nobody saw .
but little did they know , a change was coming .

then the fish of the deep .
then the mormons got a heads @-@ up .
and then everybody else .

presenting the queen of the hottie verse ,
appearing courtesy of interscope records ,

hm , let &apos;s see , quiet suburb ...
home of the tomb of the unknown mascot ...
has the lowest self @-@ esteem of any place on the planet .
really ?
前途黯淡的小镇
aw ... that &apos;s so sad . and as entertainers ,
it is our solemn duty to cheer them up for a little while .
gaga , it &apos;s my job to keep you away from
ugly bumps on the map like springfield .
don &apos;t worry , we &apos;ll get you right on a plane .
no ! don &apos;t you remember what happened at laguardia ?
ready .
yeah , well , uh , you missed your flight .
then we &apos;ll party on the boarding ramp !
wait ! i quit !
we spend 90 minutes training &apos; em and off they go .
孤独的小镇

老师请勿携带十元以上现金
soon enough for one lisa simpson .
now let &apos;s turn to the ever @-@ unpopular
&quot; popularity awards , &quot; the awards voted by students ,
in judgment of their peers .
no way that can go wrong .
first up , campus clown .
bart simpson .
that &apos;s my brother .
four years out of four .
prank you ! prank you very much !
call back .
i fail to see the honor in this .
aren &apos;t awards shows rather silly ?
what ? ! without awards shows , how would i know what movie
has the best beheading ,
or that glee is a comedy ?
and now the award for least popular student .
lisa simpson !
what ?
least popular ?
i gotta go .
you probably should accept it , lisa .
they &apos;ll go easier on you if you do
thank you for noticing me .
she actually accepted it !
you said they &apos;d take it easy on me .
i know very little about children .
we &apos;ve got to cheer up a whole town .
where &apos;s the dress i wore when i met the pope ?
it &apos;s nice , but i saw jennifer lopez wearing it .
burn it . burn it now .
help ! help !
i &apos;ve been on here since chicago !
i just want my life back !
no negativity !
oh , you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m missing a terrible winter !
and that &apos;s how berber carpet got its name according to some .
lisa , how was your day ?
um , can i be excused from holding up my end of the conversation ?
what &apos;s wrong with her ?
she just found out no one likes her .
i thought she knew .
hey , lisa , maybe you &apos;d feel a little better
if you read the daily fourth gradian message board , huh ?
let &apos;s see . &quot; uncensored jump @-@ rope chants . &quot;
oh , there &apos;s a whole thread labeled &quot; lisa simpson &quot; !
wha ... ?
ay carumba .
somebody &apos;s actually on your side !
&quot; lisa doesn &apos;t judge other people .
why should we judge her ? &quot;
it &apos;s signed , &quot; truth teller . &quot;
whoever this &quot; truth teller &quot; is , i &apos;m a fan .
it takes a lot of courage to post nice things anonymously .
you know , it seems like more than a coincidence
that milhouse brought it to our attention . hm ?
well , i certainly wish i was truth teller .
but if i was , you &apos;d know , because i can &apos;t keep a secret .
i sleep under my bed every night &apos; cause i &apos;m scared
of the cars from cars .
if gasoline is their food ,
then why do they have teeth ? !
so , lisa , i guess you &apos;re not as unpopular as we thought .
yep . message boards are never wrong .
well , um , maybe we should skip rope together .
dutch ?
double dutch .
forgive a fool her tears .
hey , lis , some fifth graders are having
a make @-@ your @-@ own pizza party at flesh @-@ in @-@ the @-@ pan pizza ,
and wanted me to invite you .
fifth graders ? ooh @-@ la @-@ la !
they get to put their desks in a circle !
and read books where the parents are divorced .
that joint is jumpin &apos; .
so , when &apos;s the party ?
&quot; lisa rocks , and so does her rock collection . &quot; huh ?
that &apos;s mine !
this notebook is full of things truth teller said .
give that back !
this one says &quot; post next friday . &quot;
oh , my god !
you &apos;re truth teller !
lisa , what you did is like my mom
sticking ten bucks in her own g @-@ string .
truth teller ?
more like lie smeller !
lie smeller ! lie smeller !
oh , great , it stuck !
take five .
hey , easy on the soda .
i don &apos;t want gassy demons like last night .
jerry .
wait a minute ...
no ! no , no !
brrr ... make it stop !
someone in springfield needs my help .
light up the after @-@ bras .
that &apos;s it , i am off of this stuff .
me , too , sweetheart .
kids ?
yes , mama .
no exceptions !
kent brockman reporting live from the springfield rail yards ,
where lady gaga &apos;s fabulous freighter
has bumped and grinded its way into town .
suffice it to say , this is the most
culturally significant train to stop here since
the mckinley funeral cortege paused to pick up casket ice .
now , sweetie , don &apos;t make a big deal out of this .
i stopped reading after &quot; top student . &quot;
want to honk your jazz tube ?
oh , what is the point ?
i think this is the end of me .
all i had was my integrity .
and now that &apos;s gone .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m so sorry .
i try not to cry till you &apos;re asleep .
i appreciate that .
look , if i could just spend a few days
in my room without anyone trying to cheer me up ,
i think i might have a chance to ...
hey , why don &apos;t we go see lady gaga ?
that &apos;ll turn your frown upside down .
it &apos;s not a frown . it is a straight line of resignation .
looks just the same upside down .
what are you talking about ? y @-@ you &apos;re right !
dad , if you really want to help , please stop trying to help .
i will , but you know me and my crazy number thing
where i always have to get to 17 .
whoops , i lost count . better start again .
gaga @-@ oo @-@ la @-@ la . gaga @-@ ra @-@ ma @-@ ma .
come on , lisa , come on .
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t really want to be here .
claws up , springfield !
never forget , you &apos;re all my little monsters !
uh , actually , i &apos;m half monster , half armenian .
pick your poison .
and you should love yourselves as much as i love you , because ...
tell us in song .
* because ...
with theatricality . come on , i woke up for this .
four !
three !
two !
where are they going with this ?
one !
when they &apos;re young
all little monsters learn that they are scary
* ugly , stupid , shunned by cupid , *
* overweight and hairy *
but every monster needs to find that secret deep inside
that transforms dr. jekyll into sexy mr. hyde
all my monsters are beautiful
disco stu @-@ tiful
square root @-@ iful ...
old coot @-@ iful
i love you , lady zsa zsa !
monsters don &apos;t need implants or a bitchin &apos; monster car
monsters only need to love the monster that they are
* gaga *
* dada *
* jawa *
* peace ! *
all right !
lie smeller ! lie smeller !
does everyone love themselves ?
that kind of thing sounds hollow from anyone but you !
now , we have to get going .
wait a minute . no .
no , no !
you !
what &apos;s wrong , honey ?
please , i &apos;ve had enough attention for one day !
yo , lighting ! i can &apos;t see the girl who &apos;s had enough attention .
we should go to your house and talk .
incognito !
oh , god .
psst ! it &apos;s me , gaga .
but no one must know .
gaga . gaga . gaga .
so peaceful . just the buzzing of the paparazzi .
hey , gary . how &apos;s your wife and kids ?
still ashamed of me . big smile !
this is where i live .
well , hello .
it &apos;s one of those music industry superstars
who &apos;s turning our innocent children into ladies of the night .
what sweater drawer did you crawl out of ?
name &apos;s ned flanders , i &apos;ve heard of you .
haven &apos;t seen so much skin since shedding season on a snake farm .
but all i &apos;m saying is that everyone is beautiful ...
yes , but jesus said that ...
pretty much the same thing .
darn it , the bible said the devil would be attractive .
what makes you think i &apos;m the devil ?
unless you &apos;re gonna slap some wieners on those , turn &apos; em off .
joke &apos;s on you ; i needed a trim .
bastards !
lisa , look at me .
so what if your number one supporter is you .
that &apos;s how it should be .
i had some very tough times myself
before i became a superstar at age 22 .
everything is gonna be fine . you better yet ?
sorry , gotta answer this text .
please , take your time .
you know what you need ?
solitude ?
flash mob !
now , lisa , if that didn &apos;t fundamentally change
who you are , i don &apos;t know what .
you idiots ! she meant we should disperse .
lisa , you un @-@ tattooed little miracle ,
i &apos;m not leaving here until i restore your sense of hope .
let me explain . i have a chance for a grim but tolerable life ,
but only if i give up hope .
now if you don &apos;t mind , and with all due worship ,
i would like to be alone .
lady gaga , meet your biggest threat : baby googoo .
can i please be alone ?
well , it worked once .
so , any ideas about lisa ?
i never have any idea what to do for lisa .
to be the mother of someone who &apos;s so smart
and so sensitive and who beautifully plays an instrument
i don &apos;t really care for ,
it &apos;s so hard .
i wish i was one of those young women
who could just wave their hands
in front of their eyes and not cry ,
because it doesn &apos;t work for me .
marge ...
marge . marge .
marge .
marge , take it easy .
it &apos;s just human contact .
i &apos;m afraid handholding isn &apos;t going to cheer me up .
well , maybe this will .
homer !
this is like the night hillary
won the new hampshire primary .
lisa snuck out .
i &apos;m going after her .
what are you gonna say ?
i &apos;ll just tell her that ...
stop it , homer !
some of that meat is me .
can i just trim the hem ?
it &apos;s yours .
oh , good . she &apos;s playing .
not so good . it &apos;s &quot; lisa roulette . &quot;
don &apos;t let her get you !
her eyes shoot loser lasers !
there is no over @-@ the @-@ top .
there is no over @-@ the @-@ top .
run !
with an egg that big , there &apos;s gotta be an even bigger chicken !
lisa ?
lisa , listen to me .
this pity party &apos;s being shut down by the smile police .
here &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna do .
why do you keep telling me what i &apos;m gonna do ?
this isn &apos;t about me .
well , who else would it be about ?
you !
it &apos;s about &quot; hello , hello , springfield . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s me , gaga ! &quot;
&quot; why is everyone looking at my purple hair
full of bluebirds ? &quot;
well , i denounce thee !
wha ... ?
i denounce thee for giving people ambitions they cannot fulfill .
and i denounce thee for positing a world
where social acceptance and walking on heels are easy !
please , may we kill the kid ?
i denounce thee ! i denounce thee !
i denounce thee !
whoa , easy , little monster .
don &apos;t &quot; monster &quot; me .
whatever you say .
are you crying ... glitter ?
tiny diamonds .
hurts like hell .
gaga , gaga , gaga , gaga ...
okay lisa , coming up to make things better !
okay , i &apos;m almost there .
upward , ever upward .
stay hydrated ...
oh , i &apos;m on the wrong tree !
okay , try again .
here we go , okay .
oh ... lisa , can you come down ?
sweetie , i &apos;ve been thinking .
now , this all started because you used a fake name
to defend yourself .
the problem &apos;s not that you were cheating .
it &apos;s that you got caught .
i cheat on my diet , but nobody knows
&apos;cause the damage is on the inside ,
and the first warning sign is sudden death .
so , honey , what do you say ?
dad , thank you !
like always , the fact that i could tune you out
without fearing i &apos;d miss out on something
gave me the time to take stock and realize
how ungrateful i have been .
which means , i &apos;ve got a train to catch .
parenting .
it &apos;s the one job you know you &apos;re always doing right .
so long , springfield . you are my waterloo .
and now i &apos;m just going to lie in bed and eat fruit roll @-@ ups .
why is she doing in defeat what i do in victory ?
gaga !
lisa ?
why are you here ?
to thank you .
for what ?
look at me ! you did help me
by allowing me to inappropriately focus
eight years of rage and rejection on you .
it was like a great sneeze .
and now i can say what &apos;s good about me .
and i can say it as lisa simpson !
just not that loud .
go ahead .
well , i am smart , nice , tolerant , funny
but not &quot; mean funny , &quot; and i never forget a birthday ,
even for kids who move away .
now , lisa , there &apos;s only one last thing
you have to do to be a little monster .
i &apos;ll do anything but sing .
you are gonna sing !
* i used to think that i was stupid *
* worthless , weak and wrong *
* a mockingbird without a song *
* i was small inside and lacking pride *
* on a one @-@ way train to be milhouse &apos;s bride *
end the song ! end it right here !
* i love npr and jazz guitar *
* someday i &apos;ll design a solar car *
* that &apos;s right , i &apos;m lisa simpson , superstar ! *
* you &apos;ve got a great big heart *
* it &apos;s at the top of my chart *
* lisa simpson , lisa simpson *
* lisa simpson superstar *
* lisa simpson , lisa simpson *
* lisa simpson superstar *
* you &apos;re a superstar *
wait , wait ! wait ... !
can you help me with my self @-@ esteem ?
i &apos;m not that good .
right , gotcha .
and the best thing is ,
even if they weren &apos;t waving , it would be okay .
i bet a lot of folks are wondering ,
did this story really happen ?
well , it did .
and i know because i was one of gaga &apos;s dancers .
the one with the spangliest crotch .
higher !
i &apos;m speaking fast because i &apos;m so excited .
see maggie simpson in her first starring role
in the longest daycare in 3d
before ice age continental drift only in theaters .
we &apos;ve already done the hardest part making the poster .
* i love my homer face *
* yeah , that &apos;s what i said *
* right where it should be on the front of my head *
* stubble , muzzle , overbite , two eyes that really bug *
* these are the components of my homer @-@ riffic mug *
