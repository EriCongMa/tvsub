you &apos;re naming the baby peter ?
yes . why ?
can i have a word with you ?
it &apos;s not what you think .
oh , and what do i think ?
no , no . wait , wait .
are you insane ?
it has nothing to do with the governor .
his name is peter and you &apos;re naming your baby peter ,
and that has nothing to do with the governor ?
it &apos;s a coincidence .
no , a coincidence is when you bump into someone
on a subway platform ,
not that you name your child after them .
i &apos;m naming my baby after the ... father .
oh , dear holy god .
it &apos;s not the governor .
who is the father ?
i can &apos;t say .
he &apos;s a private person .
he doesn &apos;t want to draw attention to himself .
oh , well , at least he doesn &apos;t want to do that .
eli , marilyn , hi .
hi , alicia .
why aren &apos;t you in the party ?
why aren &apos;t we in the party ? i have no idea .
oh , okay .
um , have you seen the band ?
no , no , just the two of us having a nice little chat .

uh , marshall . he &apos;s the business mind .
thank you very much for everything ,
and if there &apos;s anything we can do ...
um , actually , th @-@ there is something .

&apos;cause ... well , you guys are lawyers , right ?
yes .
cool , and you take on cases ? like , anyone &apos;s cases ?
well , um , sometimes . why ?
well , uh ...
hey . how you doing ?
we &apos;d like to show you something .
it &apos;s &quot; thicky trick &quot; by , you know , the , um , it &apos;s ...
rebel kane .
he was in prison with my husband .
oh , yeah ?
oh , that &apos;s ... didn &apos;t expect that .
so are you suing them ?
no , hold on , i @-@ i got this whole thing lined up .
that &apos;s us , our song .
so , you covered rebel kane &apos;s song
but you didn &apos;t get the rights for it .
no , we got the rights . we got the ...
what &apos;d we get , marshall ?
compulsory license .
yeah . murray got &apos; em .
he &apos;s our manager .
uh , okay , so what &apos;s the problem ?
ah . al @-@ almost there .
what &apos;s that ?
that is drama camp .
it &apos;s a television show about a summer camp talent show .
there &apos;s a tv show about a summer camp talent show ?
yeah , and it &apos;s a hit .
but that &apos;s our song .
they &apos;re playing our song .
no , they &apos;re singing rebel kane &apos;s song .
his lyrics , but they &apos;re covering , like ...
like we covered it .
like , that &apos;s our melody ,
and they stole it .
we were gonna let the whole thing slide , and then ...
i ... i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s , um ...
what they &apos;re doing , it &apos;s not right .
and then you guys called us .
hiring lawyers costs a lot of money , guys .
and this is really a david and goliath situation ,
going up against a tv network .
well , that &apos;s why we were hoping you &apos;d go on ...
oh , what &apos;s it called ?
a percentage .
contingency . well ...
you know , if there &apos;s a lot of money at stake , sometimes we ...
$ 2.3 million dollars .
the drama camp version &apos;s the best @-@ selling song
on itunes for the last eight weeks .
alicia florrick , please . burl preston .
yes .
uh , do you mind my asking , are you one of her clients ?
i do mind . i &apos;ll answer anyway .
i am not one of her clients .
i am being sued by her yet again .
that &apos;s not what i was saying , no .
no , the problem is , you didn &apos;t consult with any of us .
i was in a bar . i consulted with damian .
you don &apos;t plan our future in bars .
it &apos;s los angeles , diane .
it &apos;s a good market for us .
we just opened in new york .
can we please just do one thing at a time ?
we are doing one thing at a time : expanding .
do you want to discuss this like adults ?
you agreed .
we weren &apos;t going to slow down for anyone , anything .
this is a good opportunity for us .
a client in l.a.
we don &apos;t have an infrastructure in l.a.
so we build one . let &apos;s vote .
howard . wake up , we &apos;re voting .
i move that we institute a two @-@ month ban on soliciting new clients .
no , no , that &apos;s not the ...
i second .
we have a second .
the vote is about opening an office in l.a.
it &apos;s not ab ...
the motion has already been seconded .
i am calling the question .
all those in favor of a two @-@ month delay on soliciting new clients ?
no , howard .
i thought i was voting .
no , this is a different vote .
all right , 12 yeses . all those against ?
howard .
ten noes , the motion passes .
we have a 60 @-@ day moratorium on soliciting new clients .
there &apos;s someone asking for alicia florrick .
who ?
burl preston .
well , that &apos;s a surprise .
yes .
she started her own firm .
she seems to be holding all the old grudges .
well , don &apos;t blame me for that .
oh , it &apos;s too bad .
i was looking forward to facing you in court .
how &apos;s l.a. treating you , mr. preston ?
85 degrees when i left .
32 degrees here .
you tell me .
i was thinking of signing clients in l.a.
yeah , great .
what &apos;s the case ?
the suit alicia &apos;s bringing ?
it &apos;s , uh , copyright infringement . why ?
i know how she works . i know her weaknesses .
i know how to beat her .
you &apos;re offering your services ?
no , thank you , though .
why not ?
i don &apos;t like you .
i don &apos;t like you , either . what &apos;s that got to do with it ?
the enemy of my enemy is my friend .
governor florrick &apos;s office .
yes , i &apos;ll transfer you now .
kalinda sharma , there you are . how you doing ?
good . what do you need ?
a proper hello .
hello .
hello . what do you need ?
marilyn garbanza . she &apos;s head of peter &apos;s ethics commission .
she &apos;s also pregnant .
very pregnant .
i need to find out who the father is .
all i know is that the father &apos;s first name is peter .
no .
why not ?
this is for peter . florrick .
no , technically , no .
well , who &apos;s it for , then , technically ?
alicia florrick .
i need an investigator who won &apos;t leak .
who won &apos;t hurt alicia .
with ?
the possibility that peter
is the father .
it &apos;s a slim possibility , but even the question
can ... cause problems .
i need an outsider ...
who won &apos;t leak .
$ 500 an hour .
you sure i can &apos;t get you anything ? a milkshake ?
no , thank you .
um , we were getting our paperwork in line
for the lawsuit , mr. mills , and as their manager ,
we see you purchased a compulsory license
from rebel kane , but for some reason
not a derivative copyright .
a , uh , what ?
a derivative copyright .
the compulsory rights allow you to cover the song .
but the derivative rights protect you
if you make changes in that song .
oh , i have to get two things ?
i hate it when they look at each other like that .
you don &apos;t have to get them ,
but we need the derivative rights
to sue this tv show for stealing your cover .
look , i was saving money ,
i only bought the rights i needed to .
do you know how much we make every time
that someone clicks that song on spotify ?
0.004 cents .
well , let &apos;s just get the derivative rights .
how hard can that be ?
well , you do know rebel kane .
yeah , i don &apos;t really know what happened .
we just , um , we need a ...
derivative ... copyright .
our manager kind of had a little bit of a brain fart ,
you know ?
so you need a what , a copyright ?
a derivative copyright .
i think you &apos;ll remember my husband ?
yeah .
peter .
i voted for him . i mean ...
i almost voted for him .
well , we wanted to go straight to you , mr. kane .
instead of through your label .
i get it . i was a struggling artist , too .
so how much is a derivative copyright ?
$ 5,000 , typically .
look , you name your next song after me ,
i &apos;ll give it to you for free .
actually , uh ,
money has to change hands .
even if it &apos;s only five dollars .
okay . five dollars .
come on , all these plants ain &apos;t going to pay for themselves .
great , so i will have the paperwork
sent over this afternoon .
yeah , good .
oh , here . we got it .
you &apos;re kidding . this is them ?
hey , we all started out this way .
i didn &apos;t .
they want to settle , right ?
oh , yeah . too much of an embarrassment to go to court .
hello ?
here he is .
mr. preston , hello .
you ready ...
i believe you know mr. gardner .
alicia , cary . how are you ?
good .
mr. gardner and i have decided to pursue this case together .
shall we ?
this way .
you should get over it .
get over what ?
me .
you have an odd view of me , alicia .
it &apos;s just coincidence
that we keep opposing each other on cases ?
yes . burl came to me ,
thinking you were still working at lockhart / gardner ,
and i just ...
given that drama camp stole our client &apos;s song ...
your client &apos;s song ?
... our client &apos;s cover
of the rebel kane song , we are suggesting
50 % of the network &apos;s profits .
$ 1.2 million up to this point , and 50 % moving forward .
no .
okay , what &apos;s your offer ?
$ 800,000 .
with punitive .
you &apos;re ... offering us $ 800,000 ?
no , we &apos;re suing you for $ 800,000 .
you &apos;re suing us ?
how does that work ?
you stole our client &apos;s cover of &quot; thicky trick . &quot;
wait . are you saying that i &apos;m ... - rowby .
it &apos;s a negotiating point .
no , it &apos;s not , actually .
this is a derivative copyright from rebel kane
granted exclusively to tiller television .
you &apos;ll be getting your five dollars back .
no .
our client owns
the rights to this song , and we ask that
you pay before playing it .
and please take down the online video
of your client playing our song .
no .
we &apos;ll see you in court .
alicia , we can &apos;t make money on this .
yes , we can .
have you rethought your position ?
yes . we &apos;ll see you in court .
alicia will play it as david and goliath
because that &apos;s what she knows , that &apos;s what serves her ego .
no . judge marx doesn &apos;t care .
he &apos;s a good judge .
right .
i &apos;ll see you there .
you still need two votes .
or one vote and one abstention .
yeah . i can get you that .
tell me about kalinda .
she &apos;s good . she &apos;s a straighter shooter . why ?
she &apos;s following me .
diane put her on it .
she thinks you &apos;re not to be trusted .
we &apos;ll need to talk if she finds something .
why don &apos;t we talk now ?
nah . if she finds something .
no , the question , your honor , is one of theft .
all derivative ... - there was no theft here .
again , mrs. florrick is trying to ...
if there was no theft , then why
is the plaintiff trying to change the subject ?
it &apos;s not changing the subject
to insist on a derivative copyright .
can i get a new chair ? mine squeaks .
another chair for mr. canton .
you &apos;re asking for a declaratory judgment of non @-@ infringement ?
yes . your honor , our client may not have the massive
resources their large tv network has ,
but his song was written 13 months ...
again , that is simply not true , your honor .
and it &apos;s unfortunate that mrs. florrick
has to rely on emotion rather than logic .
what emotion was i ... ?
okay , a little less emotion from everyone , please !
you may call your first witness , mrs. florrick .
you wrote this song , mr. canton ?
objection , your honor . vague .
how is it being vague ?
are you asking if he wrote the lyrics
or the arrangement or the flute part or ... ?
we get it , mr. gardner . sit .
your objection is sustained .
just be more clear , mrs. florrick .
rowby , when you say you wrote this song ,
you mean the melody , correct ?
leading , your honor .
you &apos;re the one who wanted clarity .
from him , not you .
that &apos;s an odd objection , mr. gardner ,
but accurate . i &apos;ll sustain .
what are you doing ?
breaking up her rhythm .
she hates it more than anything .
rowby , who wrote the original
song , um , the rap song ?
rebel kane .
and who wrote the tune in this video ?
i did , and the arrangements , and there &apos;s no flute .
good .
thank you .
i &apos;m , um ...
now , rowby .
yeah .
how did it come to you ...
to cover a rap song this way ?
objection , your honor . calls for narrative .
your honor , counsel is clearly making trivial objections
in order to throw me off my pace .
yes , mr. gardner . stop it !
you may answer the question .
i don &apos;t remember the question .
i don &apos;t either .
which is exactly mr. gardner &apos;s intention ,
your honor .
when do you stop ?
now , rowby ,
what ... ?
where were you when ... ?
how did it
come to you to cover a rap song in the way that you did ?
objection , your honor . which counsel is questioning ?
sustained .
can i answer that question anyway ?
sure .
please .
it was august , 8 , 2012 .
it &apos;s the year anniversary
of my dad &apos;s death , and i thought
of thi @-@ this image of rick astley doing a rap , and ...
... and i thought it was ... was funny .
you know what he &apos;s doing ?
i told him about my first time in court ,
how all the objections threw me .
yeah , he &apos;s using it .
you know how cold that is ?
alicia ... he &apos;s trying to play you .
you &apos;re doing what he wants . you &apos;re being played .
he wants you to think how low it is of him , so don &apos;t !
you &apos;re right .
where are you going ?
to change .
and the cover of this song , &quot; thicky trick &quot; --
it was your inspiration ?
yes .
you created the show drama camp ,
so this scene mattered to you ?
very much .
like many young men trying to find their identity ,
i was bullied as a kid , so i wanted to create a show
that had kids moving beyond the hate .
and you ...
i @-@ i mean ...
that &apos;s why you covered , uh ...
&quot; thicky trick &quot; thi @-@ this way ?
mm @-@ hmm , yes .
i wanted to show how two cultures needed each other .
&quot; thicky tric &quot; &quot; was a rap song
given a white @-@ bread treatment by the white kids ,
and then we had the african @-@ american kids
sing another song as a rap .
did you steal the cover of &quot; thicky trick &quot; from mr. canton ?
no .
and can you explain the similarities in the song ?
well , i do know that artists are sponges .
we take in the same information from the zeitgeist ,
transmute it into something new .
and sometimes there is a best way to do something .
uh , good artists will often duplicate
each other because they hit on the best way
at the same time .
i , uh ...
good . good .
any more questions ?
no .
what was that ?
questioning .
no , it wasn &apos;t . questioning has a point .
so you &apos;re saying the zeitgeist made you do it ?
oh , objection .
it &apos;s argumentative .
misstates testimony .
inflammatory and @-@ and 12 other objections .
which counselor is questioning here , your honor ?
yes , mr. preston . please leave it to mr. gardner
to object .
objection . argumentative .
sustained .
so , you &apos;re saying that two artists will hit
on the same inspiration at the same time ?
i &apos;m saying that they can .
and similarity does not constitute theft .
similarity is not a crime .
that &apos;s how our culture develops and grows .
do you hear any difference between these two songs ?
i see two artists covering the same song
with similar comic instincts , and that has resulted
in similar instrumentation .
really ?
really .
we need another attack .
so you decided to change ?
yup . into what i wore the night you banged me the first time .
that &apos;s pretty low of you .
i know . i wasn &apos;t so discriminating back then .
uh , are you finished with that ?
go ahead .
thanks .
how far along are you ?
almost 19 weeks . you ?
ten weeks . it &apos;s my first ultrasound .
so , this is what you have to look forward to .
oh , don &apos;t know where my significant other is .
do , uh , people normally bring their spouses with them ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m not married .
gee , i don &apos;t even know if i want to keep the father involved .
i think it &apos;ll be hard to keep mine away .
what do you mean ?
i see him every day .
i &apos;m not even sure ...
there you are .
i have been looking for you everywhere .
hi . i &apos;m jenna .
marilyn .
so , you guys been waiting long ...
kalinda ?
no , not long .
marilyn garbanza ?
oh , that &apos;s me .
nice meeting you both .
good luck .
you , too .
you following me ?
yeah .
because damian asked you to ?
don &apos;t you ever do that .
not when i &apos;m on the job .
let &apos;s get some lunch .
all right , dinner then .
say you &apos;re sorry .
for what ?
all right , you know what i hate more than anything ?
what ?
people who lose their sense of humor .
you know what i hate more than anything ?
what ?
people who disrespect my work .
i &apos;m sorry .
dinner .
anyway , by the way ...
i ask the questions ...
the hell it was .
don &apos;t @-@ don &apos;t ...
it &apos;s my cross .
no , i think it &apos;s best that i cross .
you think it &apos;s best that you cross ?
your honor ,
does counsel have questions ?
my guess is , they do .
counselors ?
mr. canton . hello .
hi .
do you remember
what you were doing on july 28 , 2012 ?
i , uh ... no . i hope nothing bad .
that was just one week
before the anniversary of your father &apos;s death ,
and you really don &apos;t remember ?
no . do you remember what you were doing
the week before the anniversary of your father &apos;s death ?
no , but i didn &apos;t speak with such clarity
about what i was doing on the anniversary of my dad &apos;s death .
well , i guess you &apos;re a better person than i am .
would it surprise you to know you were
on the studio lot where drama camp is shot ?
uh ... yeah .
i was asked to be a session musician for a commercial .
so , you were on the lot where mr. tiller works ,
where he has his inspirations ?
yeah , i could feel his glow .
objection .
mr. canton was joking with that answer .
were you just joking ,
mr. canton ?
that i could feel mr. tiller &apos;s glow
when i was on the lot where he worked ?
uh , yes , that was a joke .
and did you know that studio b ,
where you worked as a session musician ,
shares a kitchenette with studio a ... inspirations ?
your honor , let the plaintiff present evidence
that their client recorded &quot; thicky trick &quot; in that studio ,
but this is just innuendo .
no .
all we need to do is show access .
we &apos;re the ones with the ...
access does not constitute theft .
no , but access explains
how two artists had the same inspiration .
it doesn &apos;t explain anything .
your honor , we &apos;re the ones with the derivative copyright .
can you explain that to mrs. florrick ?
considering the evidence presented ,
it seems clear to me that mr. tiller
acquired the derivative work created by mr. rowby canton .
yeah .
but , unfortunately , it doesn &apos;t matter .
mr. canton , your song was an unauthorized
derivative artwork ,
therefore it is not protected .
what ?
and as odd as this may sound ,
this theft of your work was legal .
they have the derivative copyright .
you do not . defendants &apos; motion is denied .
mr. preston , mr. gardner ,
your suit may go forward .
「 值得纪念的一年 」
so , how do you not like katy perry ?
um , i didn &apos;t say i don &apos;t like her .
i said i @-@ i don &apos;t know who she is .
you don &apos;t know who she is ? you don &apos;t know who katy perry is ?
what are you , like , 50 years old ?
you don &apos;t know &quot; roar &quot; ?
* i got the eye of the tiger , a fighter *
* i &apos;m dancing through the fire *
* &apos; cause i am a champion *
* and you &apos;re gonna hear me ... *
yeah ?
uh , yeah .
no .
okay . bye .
who was that ?
um , it was my mom .
okay , i don &apos;t get ...
so @-@ so then we lost ?
no . not yet .
we &apos;re not letting them win .
you were saying you covered the song as a joke , right ?
yeah . like ... rick astley doing a rap .
and the joke was what ? what , what made it funny ?
well , if i have to explain the joke ,
i mean , it &apos;s not a very good joke .
yeah , i know . but this is ... this is about legal stuff ,
so @-@ so just tell me what made it funny .
um ... well , it &apos;s a ...
like , a r ... a rap song ,
and we were singing it like a rick astley ,
you know ...
like a rickroll .
you &apos;re satirizing the rap song .
well , sure .
rap songs are usually aggressive and hard ,
and you wanted to make fun of the lyrics
by singing them in a soft way .
yeah , we were .
yeah , that &apos;s what ... that &apos;s what we were doing , right ?
what ?
rowby &apos;s version of &quot; thicky trick &quot; was satire , your honor .
no , it was a cover .
and what does satire get you , counselor ?
it &apos;s transformative . it &apos;s a transformative artwork .
doesn &apos;t matter , your honor , you already ruled .
we have the derivative copyright .
yes , but you also believed
that there was an actual theft of rowby &apos;s work .
the only problem was
rowby didn &apos;t get contractual approval
to create a new artwork , right ?
but that doesn &apos;t matter .
if rowby satirized rebel kane &apos;s original work ,
that makes it protected .
can i just say that i love this stuff ?
i mean , i don &apos;t understand a word you guys are saying ,
but this is awesome .
if rowby &apos;s song was a transformative artwork ,
then an automatic copyright was applied
the moment he recorded it ,
and mr. tiller &apos;s theft was an actual theft .
okay , mr. agos ,
you have some room to maneuver here .
prove it &apos;s a transformative artwork and i will agree .
there is a real theft .
this is so cool .
it &apos;s like , um ... it &apos;s kind of like jazz , right ?
it &apos;s like legal jazz .
hey . edelweiss .
edelman . do you know what this meeting &apos;s about ? do you ?
yeah , will wants to lift the solicitation ban .
no . no .
this is about you voting with will .
see , will made you partner .
you owe him .
no . diane made me partner .
no .
will did .
and he can unmake you as partner .
good . we have a quorum .
where &apos;s david ?
oh , david had a flat tire .
sadly .
anthony , which way are you voting ?
you don &apos;t have to tell her that .
you &apos;re cooking the vote ?
now , i move we lift the ban ...
actually , i have to make some calls .
we &apos;ll just vote without you , diane .
sue , andrew , vickie , will you help me make some calls ?
come on .
you need 18 for a quorum .
you just lost it .
peter !
pete .
do i know you ?
no , but you do know her .
marilyn garbanza .
okay . and who are you ?
uh , i &apos;m an investigator working on an inheritance matter .
there &apos;s money due to marilyn and the father of her baby .
and you see this ?
says homecoming date , september 7 .
that date matches the date
of marilyn &apos;s conception .
okay ...
so i thought ... you might be the father ,
given that it says &quot; old flame &quot;
and old flames have a tendency to reignite at a reunion .
well , anyway , if it is you , uh ,
i have a few hundred thousand dollars coming your way .
i &apos;m married .
i know , but ...
nobody has to know . and , like i said , that &apos;s a lot of money .
look , did i want to reunite with marilyn over homecoming ?
oh , yeah .
but , in the middle of our class dinner ,
she got a call and she had to go .
go where ?
i don &apos;t know . she didn &apos;t say .
back to springfield ?
she was working for her boss that night .
her boss ?
did she say who ?
no , she said &quot; peter . &quot; that was about it .
she was staying at the sheraton .
hey , could this be about the governor ?
i know she was doing some work for him .
no , no . look , um , thanks for your time .
douglas landry @-@ james ,
dean of musicology at chicago poly tech .
and you &apos;ve ...
heard both songs at issue here ,
the original rap song and rowby &apos;s song ?
sorry .
i was waiting for my objection .
no , i think the judge is aware of what you &apos;re doing .
what am i doing ?
i have no idea what either of you are doing ,
but let &apos;s shut up .
in your expert opinion as a musicologist , sir ,
would you call rowby &apos;s song satire ?
i would .
even though
he didn &apos;t change any of the words , just the music .
especially for that reason . the song &apos;s melodic line
forces me to hear the lyrics in a new context ,
as misogynistic and nihilistic .
absolutely not . it &apos;s not parody .
and why not ?
because the words haven &apos;t been changed .
in your expert opinion as a musicologist ,
why is it important to change the words ?
because otherwise i could just steal your novel
and slap another cover on it .
a romance cover instead of a thriller .
i could call it satire and sell it as my own .
originality must be protected .
the other gentleman said
that changing the tune was a transformation of actual content .
the other gentleman isn &apos;t very well respected in his field .
oh , give it up , liv .
bite me , douglas .
right .
that &apos;s the way you usually attack any argument .
you want to get off your high horse ?
this is the woman
who thinks karaoke is a 21st century art ...
order . order .
mr. kane , what was the intent of your song &quot; thicky trick &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know . uh ...
to make money .
the lyrics here , &quot; drama queen got the cops
&quot; knockin &apos; at the door .
&quot; hair shop , don &apos;t be late ,
&quot; waitin &apos; on her section eight . &quot;
who &apos;s that describing ?
no one , really .
a ... type of woman ?
and these lyrics were intended to debunk this woman ?
take her down a notch ?
are you asking me , &quot; are these lyrics satirical ? &quot;
yes .
look , i &apos;m not the guy in that song .
the narrator in the song-- i &apos;m making a joke
about that kind of guy ,
that kind of guy that would look at women in this way .
so it &apos;s a satire of rap songs ?
a satire of the cliched braggish stance of rap songs ?
yeah . pretty much .
but that &apos;s what rowby canton says he &apos;s doing with his cover ,
satirizing the cliched braggish stance toward women .
yeah . i know .
so he thinks he &apos;s satirizing something that &apos;s already a satire ?
yeah . pretty much .
your honor , a transformative artwork
must , by definition , be transformative .
mr. canton &apos;s cover is not
because mr. kane &apos;s song is .
i never know which way this is going with you .
good news , bad news , you have the same poker face .
look , marilyn , was at a class reunion on the afternoon of september 7 .
which is the ... - date of conception , yeah . within a day or two .
good . a class reunion .
that &apos;s why she wouldn &apos;t say who the father is .
there was a peter there ?
yeah , a pete berger .
good .
what &apos;s he do ?
no , eli .
she had to leave the reunion early
&apos;cause she was called away by someone , someone named peter .
okay , it &apos;s a common name .
she was called to springfield by this someone named peter .
was peter in springfield 7 september 2013 ?
damn .
marilyn went to meet this peter at the sheraton at 10 : 00 p.m.
do you know where ... the governor was ?
did you go to the hotel ?
yeah .
staff don &apos;t remember anything ,
so i tried to look at the security footage ,
but the digital disc for that day was gone .
gone ? why ?
i don &apos;t know .
who took it ?
i don &apos;t know , eli .
blackmail ?
that would make sense .
the governor , please .
i don &apos;t have to tell you .
no , i @-@ i will keep this quiet .
peter , eli .
we need to talk .
评论
what do you need ?
any reference online of rowby &apos;s song being a satire or a parody .
any reference ?
yes . in forum pages ,
in online chats , interviews , reviews . anything .
you &apos;re looking for a consensus you can present in court ?
yes .
or even the appearance of a consensus .
just ... give me anything . i &apos;ll build on it .
is this a hail mary pass ?
yes .
is peter florrick the dad ?
no , eli . we &apos;ve had this conversation .
no , we didn &apos;t . you said you didn &apos;t want to have this conversation .
and i still don &apos;t .
so if someone has the surveillance videos
from the springfield sheraton
on september 7 , 2013,
i &apos;m not to worry ?
i ... what are you ...
you &apos;re not helping calm my nerves , marilyn .
who talked to you ?
who did you meet on september 7 ?
eli , you can &apos;t ...
marilyn , i can .
do you think a reporter isn &apos;t gonna do
what i did in an afternoon ?
are you checking up on me ?
this is my life ! of course i &apos;m checking up on you !
this is my life !
you don &apos;t delve into my personal business .
you give up the rights to privacy when you enter this office .
i do . but he doesn &apos;t .
the father of my baby doesn &apos;t .
okay , marilyn ,
you choose this man &apos;s privacy or the governor &apos;s career .
get out of my office , eli .
how are you ?
you don &apos;t like katy perry ?
jenna and you--
you tell each other everything ?
well , we &apos;re friends .
you know ?
don &apos;t you have friends ?
um ...
she likes you , by the way .
are we not friends anymore ?
there &apos;s a psychological break between us , will ,
not just a business one .
us or the firm ?
both . let &apos;s start with the firm .
alicia and the fourth years leaving has ...
put us all on edge .
diane , i &apos;m fine .
i know .
and it makes sense to charge on ahead and not look back ,
but there is a frantic quality to all of this ,
not just opening new york but then l.a. ?
look , i would agree there are some things that are ...
psychological .
but there are also some things that are just themselves .
this is just itself .
it &apos;s not just ...
i &apos;m not done .
help me , diane .
not by curbing me , by using me .
look at me .
i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m ... determined .
this is not ... about alicia .
diane , you walked away .
and now you &apos;re back .
i want you back .
but i didn &apos;t walk away ,
and i should be given a chance to do this . to lead .
you &apos;re right .
so you &apos;re voting with me ?
whatever you want .
no interruptions !
it &apos;s anne stevens from the tribune .
what does she want ?
you .
hello , anne .
you &apos;re working late .
i thought the tribune was almost out of business .
i need your comment on something , eli .
wow , you &apos;re sounding serious .
i am serious .
tomorrow by 3 : 00 , or we run with it on the web site .
run with what ?
you &apos;ll find out tomorrow .
hey .
give me a category , at least .
a video .
all right , three different online reviews
mentioned a sound at a minute , 23 .
wait , in ... in my arrangement ?
no , drama camp &apos;s .
but not in the version they eventually sold on itunes .
they had to deliver earlier tracks to the swedish itunes .
why ?
it &apos;s a big market .
this is the version they had up in sweden
before they could change it .
what are we listening for ?
uh , it &apos;s at a minute , 23 .
what ? i don &apos;t get it .
well , it &apos;s on the bass track .
listen .
uh , i don &apos;t get it .
that &apos;s ... balls .
balls , b ... it &apos;s bowl @-@ bowling ,
it &apos;s like ... oh , my god , it &apos;s bowling balls .
we recorded it at murray &apos;s work .
and before they could rerecord the tracks ,
drama camp &apos;s engineers just recycled yours .
that &apos;s theft . i mean ,
i don &apos;t care what anyone says , that &apos;s theft .
that &apos;s like breaking- into @-@ my @-@ house-
and @-@ and @-@ stealing- my @-@ stuff kind of theft .
you are awesome ! awesome !
license and registration .
what did i do wrong ?
you didn &apos;t return my calls .
i think it &apos;s best we just cool it .
why ?
i don &apos;t know if i like you .
you like me .
i don &apos;t like how much you talk .
so this is about damian .
this about him or me , or ... ?
can i go now ?
yeah , you can go .
look , i just don &apos;t like losing friends , okay ?
i mean , lovers i don &apos;t mind ,
but friends ?
they come through .
so don &apos;t make this about him or me .
drive safely .
yeah .
i am getting so sick of this song .
here it comes . you ready ?
did you hear that ?
those are bowling balls hitting pins .
and you can see it right there and right there .
there &apos;s my version of the song .
you see ? right there , that &apos;s my version ,
and that is tiller &apos;s .
bowling ball and bowling ball .
they &apos;re the same .
it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
it doesn &apos;t mean ...
that &apos;s our song , he stole our song .
we have the derivative copyright .
doesn &apos;t give you the right to steal .
they stole rowby &apos;s actual track .
then they recorded their own
before putting it in the domestic itunes store .
that is theft . actual theft .
prove it in court .
sure .
but before you do something to satisfy your ego ,
i &apos;d check with my client first .
i &apos;ll handle my client , you handle yours .
ours .
you got your hand caught in the cookie jar , mr. preston .
you can &apos;t pretend the cookie jar doesn &apos;t exist .

i have no idea .
what &apos;s happening , anne ?
i &apos;m looking for a comment , eli .
on ... ?
an anonymous tip that was sent to my office .
you want me to comment on an anonymous tip ?
that &apos;s an old reporter &apos;s trick .
throw any random aspersions
on the candidate , then get me to deny it
so you can use the denial as the story .
well , this one was sent with a surveillance video .
anne , you know how unreliable surveillance videos are .
now , the tip says ,
&quot; here &apos;s evidence of peter florrick &quot; stealing an election .
happy hunting . &quot;
any comment ?
eli ...
i thought about what you said about privacy ,
and i want you to know that i @-@ i approached the father ,
and he said he &apos;d be willing to come forward .
i want you to meet peter .
hi . peter bogdanovich .

and we just ...
