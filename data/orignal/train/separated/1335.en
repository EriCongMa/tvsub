Did you fix the sink?
I told you I'd get to it.
Your hair looks nice.
Thanks.
You cut it.
Hmm?
Yeah.
I know.
Know what?
I had lunch with her.
You know, we had a couple drinks --
Really bonded.
What are you gonna do?
What we always said we'd do if this ever happened.
No! No, no, no! Please! Please! Please, don't!
Don't!
Okay. Very nice.
Jennifer, play with him first. Enjoy it.
Ryan, you don't believe she'd pull that trigger, okay?
Let's try it again. No prop gun this time.
Ryan, come on, get up.
Okay, you're...Great at dying,
But you got to do it again.
Ryan?
Ryan, come on.
What's going on? What?
"Cauda equina" Means "Horse tail."
Cauda equina syndrome --
Gets its name because all this junk
hangs out of your spine like a horse tail.
Okay, could you stop playing with this?
Okay -- what the hell are you wearing?
Alfresco lunch-tray pants.
They came today.
"Alfresco" Means "Dining in the open air."
look.
Something's going on.
Ups boxes.
There's your tell, Maura. What happened?
Okay, let's just get back to casey.
Shrapnel from an I.E.D. Transected his spinal cord
and is still embedded in there.
Only a cowboy surgeon would attempt to remove it.
It's Hope, isn't it?
how did you know?
Yes. She e-mailed me.
She wants your kidney -- for Cailin.
I haven't responded.
You don't owe her anything, okay?
It is not your fault that she's your biological mother
Just as much as it's not her fault
that you're her biological daughter.
And that didn't sound right.
You should say, "I like both my kidneys."
and, "Have a nice life."
What are you doing out in the rain?
Oh, I couldn't get him to sleep, so I took him for a walk.
Ew.
You do that in the kitchen?
No, of course not.
Yes. She was just about to put the head in the garbage disposal.
Wait a minute.
You're messing with me, aren't you?
No.
Yeah. Your auntie Jane is a kidder.
What are you doing in the rain with my grandson?!
Babysitting.
I think when you're the father, they call it "Parenting."
He's fine. He likes the fresh air.
Oh, come here, sweetheart. Ooh.
Your daddy loved to play out in the rain
when he was a little boy.
Yes.
How's Lydia?
She's good.
I think she's gonna get a promotion at the penny saver.
good.
Aw, no! I wanted to go to bed early.
Was it a murder?
Rizzoli.
Dr. Isles.
That's so cool. Man, she's so lucky.
Looks like an accident with a prop gun.
Who pulled the trigger?
His costar.
Is that Roger Deluth?
That's my councilman.
Yeah, his wife was directing a community-theater play here.
He got her the space because he's apparently pals
with the developer of the Storrow center.
The potholes on my street are out of control.
Maybe I'll just mention it to him.
Or maybe we'll just go look at the body first.
I couldn't talk to the woman who pulled the trigger --
Jennifer Johnson, 29.
Emts are taking her to Boston general.
She's being treated for shock.
Yeah, I'd be shock, too,
If I fired a pretend gun and killed my costar.
Who was in charge of the prop gun?
Victim.
He was the star, lighting designer, and prop master.
Well, it's community theater -- they're all volunteers.
That's odd.
Look at these entrance wounds.
"Wounds" Plural? That's bizarre.
It kind of looks like a cheese grater.
Maybe he forgot to clean the prop gun...
Or left cotton wadding in it?
It hardly seems enough to kill him, though.
I need to dissect this heart to know what caused this injury.
Did you check the other blanks?
I was about to. That's his prop cart over there.
His real job was maintaining this building
and the rest of storrow center.
I'm having his truck towed to the evidence garage.
Anybody else have access to the tool box?
I'll check.
Yeah.
It looks like a tragic accident, but I'd rather be sure.
I wish it was still raining.
The sound is so peaceful.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Then why do I hear the sound of computer keys clicking?
You're accessing dmv records?
Ohh, he has a special license.
Didn't you just hear me? You shouldn't be doing this.
This is an abuse of power.
Well, that's why I'm using your computer.
I'm not abusing my power -- you are.
Well, since I'm the one who's exposed,
You're gonna go knock on his door
and talk him out of the ridiculous surgery
that he's about to have.
I have left messages, I've e-mailed,
And he doesn't respond.
So, you know... Maybe it's not meant to be.
Well, that's odd.
What?
What are those, B.B.S?
Larger...Denser -- possibly ball bearings.
Either way, mr. Fix-it
wouldn't load steel balls into his prop gun,
Unless he was committing suicide.
I'm not seeing any signs of tampering
on any of these other blanks.
Mm, me, either.
So, he either killed himself
or someone filled a cartridge with ball bearings
And then loaded it into Ryan's prop gun.
The director of the play said he kept the gun in his tool box.
Where'd he keep his tool box?
apparently, all over the place.
Storrow center has three separate buildings.
Anybody could have had access to it.
Irregularities of no specific form.
What?
Seven are perfect spheres.
Three have anomalies.
Okay, why is that significant?
Well, the clearance between part and gauge
is critical to function.
"Significant" Means "Worth mentioning."
well, if a ball bearing is out-of-round,
It can cause binding or excessive wear.
It's Frost. He has something.
Oh, hallelujah.
Bye, Maura.
Well, if they're not uniform,
they won't reduce rotational friction
and support radial and axial loads.
Jennifer and ryan weren't just costars in a play.
Oh, they were costars in real life.
Maybe that's why she was hospitalized for shock.
Yeah, or she needed to disappear in a hurry
before we could start asking her questions.
Check out this text ryan sent to her yesterday morning.
"I'm on a mission to get over you."
What happened?
From what I read,
it looks like she broke up with him,
And he...didn't take it very well.
"No point in being alive without u."
You think he committed suicide by girlfriend?
Maybe. Or she killed him.
What's the motive -- he's a crybaby?
Or a real ass...If he let her think she killed him.
Yeah, we need to talk to her.
I didn't want to do the scene with the gun. I told him that.
Were you angry with Ryan?
yes!
What were you thinking when you pulled the trigger?
Well, I was in character,
So I was thinking about how much Ryan pisses me off.
Did Ryan show you how to load a prop gun?
But I couldn't do it with my fingers.
I fell and broke two knuckles.
Jennifer, we think it's possible
that Ryan was committing suicide...
And he used you to do it.
No. No way.
Why -- why would he kill himself?
no, it was an accident.
We were getting married.
He, uh...He gave me this last night.
But I-I couldn't get it on my finger.
Why did you break up with him, then?
'cause he was always complaining about his job.
The maintenance job at the storrow center?
Yeah.
He said that there was too much to do
and that he was barely breaking even
with all the supplies and stuff.
I just got tired of listening to him complain.
I mean, I told him to quit.
He said he had to figure something out first.
Figure what out?
He never said.
It's nice that Lydia is breast feeding him.
it's so much healthier.
Plus, it's obvious why he likes it so much.
What does that mean?
If I'm gonna feed it to him, I got to try it, right?
Excuse me one minute.
Hope, how are you?
I hope I'm not catching you at a bad time.
No, no.
I was just taking a quick break
to visit with my son and grandson.
It's nice to see you.
I'm glad you two are seeing each other again.
So, Maura told you?
Told me what?
Well, I have been... E-mailing her,
But she hasn't responded.
Have a seat.
Well, she didn't tell me much,
But I know you didn't leave on good terms.
I was, uh, so shocked.
And I -- I didn't react well,
I've never in my life been as surprised...
As I was when a grown woman told me that she...
Is the baby that I thought died at birth.
How's, uh... How's Cailin doing?
She's doing very well.
I know this isn't my business,
Although, uh, Maura -- Maura is my business.
Did you come here to ask her to --
Yes.
I came to see if she is still willing
to donate one of her kidneys to Cailin.
Hey, Tommy, honey?
Come here. Bring me T.J.
Oh, yeah.
He really is a beautiful baby.
You know, I would do anything for any one of my children
And for this baby.
So, no one --
no one can blame you for wanting to save Cailin.
Can you scan for depression?
Are you depressed?
Only when you ask me that -- no, I meant him.
I don't understand why he would kill himself that way, you know?
I mean, something's hinky here.
I think you should talk to him.
He's dead, Maura.
I meant Casey.
I'm scared.
Of what?
More rejection.
He's only rejecting you out of fear.
And if you don't try
to talk him out of a surgery that could kill him,
You'll regret it.
Well, now I'm really scared.
What is this?
Why does he have concrete in his tool box?
I am so glad that you said "Concrete" And not "Cement."
Too many people think it's the same thing,
When cement is actually a component of concrete.
No, but why is he saving it?
And why is he saving a broken fluorescent light bulb,
A copper pipe, and a bent anchor bolt?
Well, maybe he needs to purchase more.
Yeah, but it looked like he was hiding it.
"'creep'? Epoxy. Recycled?"
That's a strange list.
Oh. So, he xeroxed some plans.
He was in charge of maintenance for all three buildings.
It makes sense that he had building plans.
What do you think that means?
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!
It's your mother.
Oh, my god.
And my mother -- my biological mother, Hope.
She's in the cafe. What is she doing here?
She came to get your kidney?
Stop.
Can you please go talk to her?
What?!
I -- why do I have -- she's your...Relative.
Oh, no. She rejected me.
She said that I wasn't her daughter.
But then she remembered she needed your kidney
for her real daughter, Cailin!
I don't want to talk to her.
But I -- I can't keep ignoring her. It's rude.
So...Call her and tell her to make an appointment.
Good idea.
But w--
No? All right.
Dr. Martin. Didn't you get my message?
I'm...very busy today.
Yes, I did.
But I would really like to talk to you.
What do you want to talk about?
When we met...I said that I felt a strange kinship with you.
You also, uh, said that conceiving me
was the biggest mistake of your life.
I'm sorry that I said that.
Maura, I had no idea.
Paddy told me that our baby died.
And I visited the grave.
You're really trying to tell me
that you've never seen any of this?
Paddy Doyle's capture was international news.
I closed the door on that part of my life.
Well...At least your 18-year-old had the guts to confront me.
You just denied your life.
The harvard girl who got seduced
by the -- the evil thug.
And then you ran.
I'm...very sorry.
I had this...
this stupid little-girl fantasy...
that when we met, you'd be...
everything that you are.
But you'd want me.
You'd be very happy to know that I was alive.
I reacted badly.
"Badly"?
You accused me of lying.
You told me that I wasn't your daughter.
I actually think that you asked me what I wanted from you.
Yes, I did.
And now you're back.
Do you see Paddy Doyle when you look at me?
Do you see evil?
No.
And I saw so much good in your father.
Paddy Doyle's not my father.
I loved him.
And he was the -- still is --
the most complicated...
intelligent, damaged human being that I've ever met.
Why are you here?
Cailin.
Well...
I know what I should do --
Give you my kidney to save your daughter.
But I'm your daughter, too.
I know that I have no right to ask you.
You don't.
I think you should go.
Hello. I'm looking for lieutenant colonel Casey Jones.
He's not?
Do you have any idea when he'll be back?
Okay. Thanks very much.
Guess what we found.
What? No! I was gonna say that.
Found this in the victim's glove box.
That's weird.
I found this in the victim's tool box.
We matched that chunk of concrete
with this nasty dent in the hood of Ryan's pickup truck.
Ryan filed an insurance claim three days ago.
"A loose chunk of concrete
"dropped from the ceiling of the garage at work
And caused this damage."
Frost, can you pull up articles
on the construction of the storrow center?
Sure.
Okay, so we've got concrete that's fallen on Ryan's truck,
Concrete debris that he hid in his tool box...
Xeroxed plans for the storrow center --
What's that say to you?
Well, his girlfriend said he was complaining
about all the maintenance work he had to do.
Which makes no sense.
The storrow center's basically brand-new.
Tenants only started moving in eight months ago.
and in other news,
after three years of legal wrangling,
developer Sam Nelson won approval to build
the billion-dollar storrow center.
I'm finally seeing my dream realized --
Three towers with combined office, retail,
and living space next to the charles river.
The storrow center is my gift to Boston.
His "Gift."
Did he mention the billion dollars he's also pocketing?
Says here he already has
four more contracts for city buildings,
Plus a mall and an office park.
You think maybe Ryan was the mosquito buzzing around him,
complaining about chunks of concrete and busted lights?
Maybe.
Although...
Look at this post-it I found.
My father used to complain all the time about creep.
The ones your were dating?
That's funny.
No.
Ryan saved anchor bolts with dried epoxy.
He wrote "Epoxy" On this post-it.
Okay, creep can happen over time.
The concrete cracks, the anchor bolts pull out,
And the pipes burst.
My father hated being blamed when the pipes burst from creep.
Maybe Ryan was finding problems
with the storrow center buildings.
Sam Nelson would want to cover that up.
What, enough to kill one of his employees?
Maybe.
Billions of dollars at stake for one maintenance guy?
What? Where you going?
The Storrow Center. It's not far.
We don't have enough to say hi to this guy.
And you know Sam Nelson has a stadium full of lawyers.
Yeah, we show our cards now, we'll never get him.
Can you guys relax?
I'm just gonna snoop around in the public areas.
With your cellphone?
With the camera in my cellphone.
Jane, can you give Tommy and the baby a ride home?
Why can't you?
I'm filling out paperwork.
I don't have anything to do.
I can drop them after I take the photos.
Really? You're sure?
Yeah. No problem.
All right. Thanks.
Good, 'cause Maura needs a shoulder to cry on.
Why? What happened?
Girl stuff.
Maura, what are you doing?
Looking for the oblivion of sleep.
What about him?
He doesn't mind.
Okay. Come on.
You're gonna get lip gloss on your nice pillow.
I don't care.
I thought you told her to make an appointment.
She just showed up.
Well, at least you got to keep your kidney.
No, no, no. It wasn't even about that.
I wasn't holding my kidney hostage.
Okay, this conversation just took a weird turn.
I can't believe I just did that.
Wha-- did what?
I stopped being nice. I said what I thought.
I was really mad and hurt, and I just...said it.
Maura, that's good.
That's okay, all right? I'm proud of you.
I feel nauseous. What did I say? Why did I say it?
Why -- I don't even know what I said.
Okay, okay. Let's talk about something else.
Ooh! Ball bearings.
You like to talk about ball bearings.
Well, I'm almost certain
that they came from a computer hard drive,
and the lab is trying to track down the manufacturer.
Okay. Good.
Speaking of balls, I strapped mine on
and called Casey's office.
You did?
He took a leave of absence yesterday.
Well, go talk to him now -- like right now.
It's my lunch hour, and I only have 43 minutes left.
Well, that's enough time to say what needs to be said.
I don't know what needs to be said.
Say "enough with the magical thinking that could kill you
or leave you a quadriplegic."
Ohh, I don't know why I'm doing this!
'Cause you love him.
There's nowhere to park.
You're a cop. You can park anywhere.
Yeah. Yeah, why not? I'll only be a minute.
Okay.
Oh. All right, T.J.
Jane, what are -- what are you doing here?
Can I talk to you?
It's not a good time.
Well, there's not gonna be a better one.
It's not too pretty, is it?
I didn't mean to come here unannounced.
I'm not here to embarrass you, okay?
I have tea, uh, water.
Can't drink alcohol.
Because of the surgery.
Right.
So you're going through with it?
Yeah. I am.
Maura seems to think that...your spinal injury
is in a place that's hard to repair.
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
And -- and that whatever surgical procedure you're having
is risky.
It is -- very.
Well, how risky? Like, "You're gonna die" risky?
More likely, I'll end up a full paraplegic.
Oh, my god.
I told you it wasn't romantic.
Well, then, why do it? Okay, why make things worse?
This catheter.
I was about to put it in when y--
Look, I'm -- I'm sorry.
I'm not saying it doesn't suck, okay? It does.
All right? But it's reality.
And I can deal with reality just as long as you talk to me.
Okay?
Reality? I can't feel, Jane.
I can't --
Not just here.
I cannot feel anymore.
I can't make love to you.
I can deal with crutches and the leg braces,
and...I can even deal with the catheters.
I can't live without being able to feel you.
Give you children.
Are you hungry? You want some of this?
Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing?
Who said you could take pictures here?
Easy, Mr. Nelson. Boston police.
Do you have a warrant?
Otherwise, I want you off my property -- now.
This part of Storrow Center is open to the public, sir.
All right. I'm gonna call my attorney.
Damn.
All right, when I get back, I want you gone!
Oh, my god. What the hell?
T.J.!
Okay. I guess I should go.
It's Fr-- I'm so sorry.
Frankie, again.
Answer it.
I-it could be an emergency.
Yes -- what? - Jane?
Jane, there's been a huge collapse at the Storrow Center.
You've got to get down here.
Calm down, Fr-- what?
It's really -- listen to me!
That's where Tommy and Frost were, okay?
Oh, my -- okay. - Just get down here, Jane!
N-- I'll be right there. I'll be right there!
Get down here! Now!
What is it?
Uh...my brother and my baby nephew and my partner --
T-there's been a building collapse in the Back Bay,
and they think they're trapped inside.
Let me come with you.
N-no. I-I can't wait for you.
Follow critical response protocol.
Everybody understand?
Nothing we can do about the people trapped
in the subterranean parking areas right now.
We evacuate everybody else first.
Captain Green!
Detective Rizzoli --
my brother and his baby and my partner
are trapped in the underground parking level p-3.
I'm sorry, Detective.
That building is way too unstable
to even think about that right now.
No, but we have to go --
I've got three more with internal injuries.
Okay, transport the head injury.
Maura!
Maura!!
What is it?
They're inside the building -- Frost and Tommy and T.J.
Oh, my god. Are you sure?
Jane! Jane.
I couldn't find them.
We were pulling out bodies a-and people with broken bones.
We got to as many of them as we could
before they ordered us out.
They're afraid that the entire building is gonna collapse.
It's built from recycled concrete.
What?
The lab results came back
on the concrete samples that you found.
It's recycled -- ground-up concrete debris,
not the more durable concrete made from hard rock.
Ryan's list.
"Recycled." He knew.
W-what other shortcuts did this builder take?
They can't find him.
Sam Nelson, the developer --
He was last seen leaving right before the collapse.
He's probably halfway to the Marshall Islands by now.
Okay, look, you don't say a word to ma, okay,
until we're sure they're in there.
Dr. Isles? We've got more coming.
Maura, go. Go.
Come on. We're going in there.
They won't let anyone past them. I tried.
Okay, so we try again. Come on.
Jane. Jane, wait. You can't.
You can't.
I hope they're still alive in there.
I know. I know. I know.
ohh, T.J.!
T.J.! Daddy's right here!
Daddy's right here! It's gonna be okay!
It's gonna be okay, t.J.
You hang in there, buddy, okay?
D-detective Frost!
I'm here. I'm here.
My head is killing me.
I can't get my arm out.
Help over here!
Local 4 operating engineers are sending in more heavy equipment.
Well, tell them to get a move on.
Okay.
And I'll reach out to, uh, building collapse units
in Connecticut and New York.
Councilman Deluth, Captain Green, we need to talk to you.
We're doing all we can, detective.
It's bad concrete.
What?
The builder -- he used recycled concrete.
That's what caused the collapse.
No, that wouldn't be enough
to cause such a catastrophic failure.
I-I spoke with the structural engineers who built it.
They think that it was a combination of the heavy rains
and the additional stories
that the developer added to building 3.
So, maybe vibrations from the heavy equipment
and the additional pilings compromised building 1?
Yes.
We want to go in.
Our brother and our nephew are trapped inside there.
I don't want a marble rolling around in there right now.
It's not a question of if that building is coming down.
It's a question when.
I promise you,
if we can get enough equipment in there and shore it up,
I'll go in there myself.
Captain Green!
Initial GCS of 5.
Point tenderness at the left parietal.
Internal bleeding. He needs to get to Beth Israel.
I'm out of transport right now.
Get a police car and get him out of here.
Hey, you got a car?
Dr. Isles. What can I do?
FEMA put out a call to all off-duty nurses and doctors,
so I just came as soon as I heard.
Thank you.
Can you assess the patients over there?
I think that woman has a fractured femur.
Hello, ma'am. I understand you're in pain.
Which leg is it, please?
This one? All right.
That's all right. It'll be okay.
Nothing so far? Okay, just keep looking.
I'm sorry, Jane. Frost is better at this.
You're doing fine, okay?
Just get to the p-3 camera at about... maybe like 1:15 or so.
Okay. Almost there.
Jane, I got something.
That doesn't mean they're alive.
It means they're in there.
I can't risk other lives.
There's a 3-month-old baby in there.
We can't just stand here!
I'm letting you stay out of courtesy, detective,
but if you try to go into that garage,
I will put you on the other side of that barricade!
Code on, evac -- move it!
Don't give up.
I'm not. I'm not.
Okay.
I don't know how to scan these plans.
Can you see that?
Yeah, sort of.
All right. He circled a section on p-3.
Okay.
This looks like an arrow.
He's got a rectangle labeled "P-3 floor"
and then a circle with a question mark inside.
No, but maybe there's something under p-3.
P-3 is the lowest level.
Jane! Jane.
The lab was able to trace the ball bearings used to kill Ryan
back to 500 recalled computers.
Okay. Okay. I'm talking to Korsak.
No, listen to me.
Most of those computers were purchased for city employees,
including all 13 city counselors.
Korsak, find out the name of the concrete company
that supplied the concrete to Sam Nelson.
Give me a sec. Give me a sec. Give me a sec.
Koneff Concrete.
Looking for the owner.
Claire Koneff Deluth.
The wife of the councilman?
Oh, god.
They put the concrete company in her name
to avoid conflict of interest.
Thanks.
Here you go.
We really appreciate everything you guys are doing.
You know, this is a hard thing --
Was it worth it?
Sorry?
This -- all so you could pocket a few hundred-thousand more?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
No?
Okay, how about you?
You loaded that prop gun with ball bearings.
You watched Jennifer pull the trigger.
How was it watching Ryan die?
It was awful. My god.
Claire, don't.
Ryan came to you for help
because you were married to a city councilman,
and he wasn't getting anywhere with the builder,
who didn't know you used recycled concrete.
We had no idea that this could happen.
Stop talking. Stop talking, Claire! Stop talking.
We underbid the project.
It wasn't all bad concrete.
Ohh, just some of it.
You're both under arrest for the murder of Ryan Granger.
And let's hope today's body count
doesn't get over seven, because if it does,
you're both going down for those murders, too!
We didn't know.
Ow, shut up, Claire!
I swear we didn't know.
Put your hands behind your back.
Come on. Let's go. Move!
Yeah?
I found something. There's a tunnel under P-3.
What? W-what do you mean?
I checked old MBTA records.
There's an abandoned subway work tunnel.
Koneff Concrete was supposed to fill that tunnel with concrete
and reinforce it with concrete piers.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Yeah, they skipped that part to pocket an extra 500k.
Which means that tunnel's still there.
You don't have to do this.
Oh. Now you tell me.
What are all these cans?
Old civil defense water cans.
They used to store them here.
Little did they know,
it wasn't a very effective atomic bomb shelter
because of the chimney effect.
Can we talk about this later?
Please go back.
No!
Tommy?
Yeah?
What does it mean when I feel like I got to puke?
It means you have a head injury.
Hey, the baby's not making any noise, Barry.
He's okay. I know he's okay.
You got a girlfriend?
Nah.
Are you gay?
No.
I had a big crush on your sister for a long time.
On my sister? You mean Jane?
You got another sister?
I liked Maura.
Dr. Isles? That's your type?
I like Lydia, too.
You know what?
If y-you could just put the two of them together...
they'd be the perfect woman.
I mean, right?
You know what I'm gonna do if we get out of here?
Marry Lydia?
No.
I'm gonna sue the --
I don't think we can go any further.
Let me check here.
Maura, I can't tell my mother that my brother's dead.
Jane. Look. Look.
That's them. That's them!
Come on.
They're almost there, Jane.
That's it. We're through.
All right, get them up there.
Ready?
Is anybody in here?!
Stay clear of the opening.
Oh, my God.
M-maura, he's not moving.
That's a vigorous cry, Jane. He's okay. Okay.
All right, get that baby out of here.
Come on, Jane. Come on. Jane, come on!
Ohh, baby, baby. Oh, come on.
T.J. T.J.
Oh, yeah, you're okay.
Anything?
There's Frost!
How you doing, ma'am?
Thank God.
Hey. You all right?
Yeah -- busted arm. I-I think that's it.
It's good to see you, man.
Thank you.
Boy, you sure know how to make an exit.
Where's Tommy? I don't see Tommy!
Oh, my God! There's Tommy!
Tommy!
Hey, man. How -- how you doing?
I'm okay. Exc -- except for my head.
Is T.J. Okay?
Yeah, yeah. He's right here.
He's right here, baby. He's fine.
Oh, Tommy!
Oh. I'm okay, mom.
Ta -- just make sure Lydia pumps for him, okay?
Okay, but we'll take good care of him.
I love you, baby.
Let's load him up!
Come on, take him! Take him!
I want to help Cailin.
She told me what she said to you.
She said, "I don't want any part of you living in me."
I'm so sorry.
We all say and do stupid things.
I'll have Boston General's transplant unit
arrange everything.
I -- I don't want Cailin to ever know.
Maura --
No. Promise me.
I promise.
Can I -- would it be all right with you if...
I will never be able to thank you.
How long you been here?
I didn't want to leave until I knew they were safe.
Thank you.
I'm sorry for what I said about...
not being able to wait for you.
It just slipped out.
It's okay.
Go be with your family.
Well, what about you?
I'll be okay.
Or I won't.
It's my choice.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
It's just another day at the office, huh?
You okay?
Yeah.
