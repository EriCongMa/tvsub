第七季 第九集
nice to see you again .
let me know if i &apos;m not in frame .
i can move down .
i &apos;m not wearing a camera .
oh , how considerate .
let &apos;s skip the hostility , please .
she went out of her way to make us look like bigots .
i think i &apos;m being pretty friendly , considering .
i can see you went with diversity in hiring .
how are biff and skippy ?
mike and brian .
what can we do for you , monica ?
i can &apos;t imagine that you &apos;re here to apologize .
a friend of mine was recently run out of business
by a giant tech company .
i &apos;m bringing suit .
and you don &apos;t have the resources to pursue the case on your own ?
you said to call if i needed help .
you &apos;ve complicated our relationship
since i made that offer .
true .
but at least we know we can be direct with each other .
besides , it could be good for your image .
how ?
the company i &apos;m suing is even
more lacking in diversity than yours .
and what company is that ?
chumhum .
and you want us to help ?
well , actually , i need lucca to help , but i know you two
have this bert and ernie thing going .
well , why me ?
alicia &apos;s the one that &apos;s worked with chumhum .
well , it &apos;s a racism case .
and , uh , my firm &apos;s a little pale at the moment .
what an honor . my parents would be so proud .
who &apos;s suing ?
we used to booked up weeks in advance .
our venison pot pie was written up in the trib .
we were zagat rated .
then people just stopped coming .
it &apos;s hard not to take it personally when it &apos;s your baby .
and why is chumhum responsible ?
their maps program-- chummy maps--
it &apos;s supposed to help users stay safe
by giving them directions
to avoid the dangerous parts of the city .
green &apos;s safe , yellow &apos;s so @-@ so ,
and red means &quot; stay away . &quot;
when the filter &apos;s on ,
driving directions avoid the red areas .
the filter is always on by default .
you have to manually turn it off .
so you lost your foot traffic ?
and this-- watch when i toggle the filter on and off .
it doesn &apos;t show businesses in the red parts of the map .
when this came out , it was like i didn &apos;t exist .
it says this is an unsafe area ?
yes , a red zone .
it doesn &apos;t feel unsafe .
yes , except for one thing .
too many people of color .
our maps are not racist .
it &apos;s run by an algorithm .
and math is not racist .
chumhum is very proud of its diversity and openness .
and yet their safe filter
deters people from patronizing businesses
in african @-@ american neighborhoods .
chumhum is not responsible
for the actions of those who respond to its software .
it was ms. feldman &apos;s choice to open a four @-@ star restaurant
in a marginal neighborhood , not ours .
it isn &apos;t a marginal neighborhood ,
it &apos;s a black neighborhood .
well , it &apos;s both , which really
isn &apos;t that uncommon .
wait , what ? !
well , he &apos;s not saying anything that unusual .
look at crime rates . look at home values .
and look at the biracial lawyer pimping for a racist system .
excuse me ? ! are you actually saying-- ?
let &apos;s not make this personal , guys . wait , wait , wait , wait .
hey , wait .
chumhum will admit no wrongdoing .
but in the spirit of making this world a better place ,
mr. harman is willing to offer ms. feldman $ 50,000
to open a new restaurant anywhere she wants .
consider it a gesture .
what gesture is that ?
the finger ?
chumhum is worth 300 billion .
i know how much my company is worth , thank you .
is that because your stock &apos;s dropped 22 %
since you became coo ?
wow , seriously ?
okay , cary , you don &apos;t need to go there .
want to fight dirty now ?
you know what ? you know what ?
no , we &apos;re done !
your guy &apos;s a piece of work .
unfortunately for you , the law &apos;s on his side .
we &apos;ll see .
you &apos;re kind of in love with her ,
aren &apos;t you ?
who ?
alicia .
no .
you just talked about her for the last 30 minutes .
occupational hazard .
you have to be obsessed with your candidate ,
or you &apos;re not doing your job .
&quot; candidate &quot; ?
well , the question is will the voters think
she &apos;s still tainted by her scandal ?
you &apos;re staring at me . i can feel it .
i can &apos;t help it .
you are very sexy when you &apos;re writing a check .
$ 50,000 ?
convene a focus group .
see if you &apos;ve resurrected st. alicia .
but above all else ,
i am a mother , and it &apos;s as a mother
i am asking for your support , webster city .
i know ethanol can make a difference for our children .
so please remember , a vote for florrick
is a vote for family .
really ?
i feel like i &apos;m pandering to housewives .
anyone who knows me will smell
the bullcrap a mile away .
yes , but it &apos;s iowa .
all they smell is bullcrap .
look , these e @-@ mail blasts
aren &apos;t meant to be subtle .
they &apos;re a sledgehammer .
so don &apos;t pull back .
okay , what &apos;s the next city ?
three , two ...
hello , voters
of sioux center .
i &apos;m alicia florrick .
as the mother of two incredible--
kids ... i , um ,
love and adore ...
do you need a minute ?
yeah , it just ... thanks .
hey .
what &apos;s wrong ?
uh , nothing .
all right , so i have something to say .
okay .
now , we agreed that i would stay freelance , right ?
yes .
that &apos;s how i keep my fee low .
and part of that
freelance work has taken me
to lockhart / agos .
i know .
well , clearly you have some
hard feelings toward them ,
but , alicia ,
i would never use
information gleaned from here--
oh , no i never thought you would .
but if you have some sort of issue with this arrangement ,
then we should talk , because i need to know
whether i can continue working here .
i want you to work here .
even if freelancing takes me to lockhart / agos ?
yes .
good .
i have something for your motion to dismiss .
oh , i thought you were gonna say
you were going to lockhart / agos for this case .
no .
unless you want me to .
no . shut up .
uh , here .
thank you .
you &apos;re suing chumhum
for tortious interference
with prospective economic advantage ?
yes , your honor , chumhum &apos;s safe filter
creates a racist geofencing effect that disadvantages
business owners in african- american neighborhoods .
your honor , tortious interference requires
proof of either purposeful or knowing interference .
and there is none here .
we believe there is , your honor .
i &apos;d like to call a witness to show
that the intent requirement is not met .
mr. harman , is it possible for chumhum &apos;s safe filter
to have a racist intent ?
no , the filter is powered by two things , and two things only :
objective third party statistics--
uh , crime rates , for example--
and user @-@ generated feedback data .
like comments and reviews ?
yes , exactly .
which is entirely in the users &apos; hands .
i mean , there &apos;s no way that anyone at chumhum
could use a safe filter
to purposefully interfere with plaintiff &apos;s business ?
no , not even if we wanted to .
thank you . mr. harman , is it true that chummy maps
is only available on cos-- chumhum &apos;s own operating system ?
yes . this is a recent study done
by the internet research foundation .
could you read what it says right there ?
uh , &quot; cos users are 71 % ...
caucasian . &quot;
and what percentage of cos users are african @-@ american ?
does it say ?
eleven percent .
and do these numbers match your own market research ?
chumhum is not to blame for socioeconomic disparity .
our products cost more because they are better products .
so you knew about the disparity between white and black users ?
again , our products are not intentionally
targeted toward caucasians .
yes , but if your user @-@ generated feedback data
is being generated predominately by white users ,
doesn &apos;t it follow that the results will be skewed ?
objection , speculation .
perhaps .
and yet i &apos;m still curious .
would the results be skewed ?
no .
really ? if you allow
one racial group to dominate a discussion
about what neighborhood is safe , you don &apos;t think
the results will be skewed ?
objection !
asked and answered .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m just giving him a chance to rethink .
but it seems he doesn &apos;t want to .
withdrawn .
purposeful or knowing interference
doesn &apos;t just mean the defendant knew
his product could have a disparately
racist effect .
it also means ...
he should &apos;ve known .
we lost .
mr. harman admits he knew
their data was being generated
primarily by caucasians ,
so an argument can be made
that he should have known
what would result .
ms. quinn , mrs. florrick ,
your motion to dismiss is denied .
request full discovery , your honor .
your honor !
plaintiff is only asking for full discovery
in order to force us to settle .
poking around all of chumhum &apos;s products
would compromise trade secrets .
but you can &apos;t shut them out entirely .
i &apos;m granting the discovery motion
and limiting it to items
related to racist references
and chummy maps .
what do you think ?
small .
you don &apos;t get claustrophobic in here ?
i &apos;m actually starting to like it .
yeah , stockholm syndrome .
i meant what do you think about the focus group ?
you want to run her for a senate seat ?
to start .
alicia florrick .
wife of the illinois governor ?
a woman who stood by her husband during his worst moments .
housewives-- republican and democratic .
and independents .
how large a sampling ?
whatever i can get for $ 50,000 . but we have to have
ironclad waivers . nobody can know we &apos;re doing this .
especially not alicia .
why not alicia ?
because i &apos;m using it to convince her .
yup , good old eli .
yeah .
what &apos;s wrong ?
gina , could you come in here ?
do we need the cone of silence ?
alicia and jason crouse .
i have no idea what that means .
jason crouse . alicia &apos;s investigator .
i know who he is--
are they having an affair ?
no , of course not .
no .
he came by the apartment
while i was filming alicia &apos;s internet ads
and she touched him .
touched him where ?
his arm .
like a massage ?
no , not like a massage .
then let it go .
she touched his arm .
people touch each other &apos;s arms .
she was smiling at him like a schoolgirl , eli .
and not just in front of me--
in front of the whole crew .
eli , i want to be clear here .
they were touching
in front of strangers with cameras .
okay , let me look into it .
now , we both know
peter &apos;s campaign wouldn &apos;t withstand
the fallout of something like this .
and alicia &apos;s rehabilitation would certainly
become a wasted effort .
okay , let me handle it .
oh , eli , you didn &apos;t even know !
i said i &apos;d handle it !
oh , damn .
judge marx has ordered limited discovery ,
confined to &quot; racist references &quot; and &quot; chummy maps . &quot;
we &apos;ll split up chumhum hard drives
and review all e @-@ mails ,
software specs and memorandums .
mark them as either responsive or nonresponsive .
uh , how narrowly are we interpreting &quot; responsive &quot; ?
well , don &apos;t want to do the opposition any favors .
well , any disagreements , we &apos;ll discuss .
good . call me here . and good luck .
what ?
march 5 of this year : &quot; why do we include home ownership rates ? &quot;
in reference to ... ?
there &apos;s no subject line ,
but it &apos;s in a thread about the safe filter .
who to who ?
chummy map coder kip o &apos;neill to his super ,
larry melanie .
damn . i think this one &apos;s responsive .
but did they include home ownership rates into the algorithm ?
no .
so ... ?
they were considering it .
so ? they didn &apos;t do it . mark it as non @-@ responsive .
come on .
they discussed including home ownership rates
in the design of safe filter .
i mean , that would automatically disadvantage poorer neighborhoods .
it &apos;s a proxy for race .
yes , but , again , they didn &apos;t ,
and so it wasn &apos;t .
well ... let &apos;s let the judge rule on its relevance .
anyway , you sure you &apos;re not misinterpreting this e @-@ mail ?
it says ,
&quot; why do we include home ownership rates ? &quot;
h @-@ how else do we interpret that ?
maybe the emphasis is on &quot; we . &quot;
&quot; why do we have to be the ones who have to do this ?
why can &apos;t somebody else to do it ? &quot;
there &apos;s an easy way to find out what he meant .
apricot thyme granola or rose pistachio pepita ?
we rotate every day .
almond milk ? we make our own .
no , thanks . we &apos;re good .
so about those home ownership statistics ?
yeah , that was just in beta .
uh , what was in beta ?
our use of home ownership stats .
to determine which neighborhoods were unsafe ?
yeah ,
but only in beta .
see , we had to show users something on day one ,
before there was any user feedback ,
so we used other data just to start it off .
so what percentage of the results is currently shaped by user feedback ?
100 % . we realized that
if we kept it completely in the users &apos; hands ,
we would avoid another &quot; animal &quot; incident .
okay , a what incident ?
just something that happened last year in the imaging department .
we were this close to causing a major you @-@ know @-@ what storm . i &apos;ll show you .
uh , no , no . no , no , no .
i &apos;ve got my computer ...
no , just stop . it &apos;s okay . stop .
well , we just can &apos;t pretend he didn &apos;t say something .
no , but he didn &apos;t say chummy maps .
um , does this thing that you were about to show us ...
the &quot; animal &quot; incident ?
right .
does it have to do with chummy maps ?
no , but we were all worried we were gonna ...
uh @-@ uh , uh @-@ uh . no , no ... don &apos;t say anything else , okay ?
if it doesn &apos;t have to do with the maps ,
then we don &apos;t have to look at it .
and we really shouldn &apos;t look at it .
在这片儿感觉不安全 有人跟踪了我三个
what ?
something in the discovery ?
no . the reader comments on safe filter .
&quot; super shady street ! &quot; exclamation point .
&quot; heard gunshots , never going back ! &quot;
sad face .
you think it &apos;s racist ? do you ?
he heard gunshots . it &apos;s not racist .
my guess is he thought he heard gunshots .
more discovery from chumhum . we &apos;ll take half .
oh , good . thank you .
so ...
biff and , um , skippy are working out well for you ?
yes , they are .
and how is that not reverse racism ?
how is what not-- making fun of their names ?
yeah , calling them white stereotyped names .
is that what biff and skippy are ?
country club names from some bad skit somewhere--
polo outfits and tennis racquets-- don &apos;t pretend
like you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m talking about .
we don &apos;t want to be having this conversation .
we already are .
yes , reverse racism
that dangerous contagion that &apos;s taking hold of society .
it doesn &apos;t have to be a contagion to be true .
so how is is that not reverse racism ?
because harm is necessary for racism to be ... harmful .
but you think they &apos;re idiots because they &apos;re big white guys ?
no , i think they &apos;re idiots because you hired them instead of me .
can i see your laptop ?
why ?
because i want to steal it .
what ?
banner ads .
this one &apos;s my chumhum account .
and this one &apos;s yours .
i get ...
soul food
and you get ...
skiing .
meaning ?
maybe we can expand the discovery .
alicia &apos;s out .
that &apos;s fine .
i &apos;ll wait for her .
you doing some work ?
yup .
mind if i ask you a few questions ?
that depends .
on what ?
the questions .
married ?
i am not .
girlfriend ? kids ?
i &apos;ve had girlfriends .
not had kids .
i have a daughter .
divorced .
me , not my daughter .
sorry for my nosiness .
i just like to know about alicia
and her life .
no problem .
you know , they &apos;re actually paying me now ,
so i &apos;m gonna get back to work .
she &apos;s getting close to you .
isn &apos;t she ?
i think these are questions for alicia , not for me .
you understand why i ask ?
her husband is running for president .
there &apos;s a lot more attention being paid .
i think these are questions for alicia ,
not for me .
good talking to you .
the ads you &apos;re seeing are for things you might like , right ?
things you search for or shop for online .
that &apos;s right .
and the ads you see
are different from the ads that i see ?
yes , they are .
your honor , the ads are just targeted .
advertisers tell chumhum they want to reach people
of a certain age , gender , ethnic background ,
and chumhum obliges .
that &apos;s nothing more than retailers wanting to reach their customer base .
opposing counsel &apos;s missing the point , your honor .
am i ? tell me .
the point isn &apos;t that white people get white ads
and black people get black ads .
because you haven &apos;t made that point .
the point is the ads that appear on chummy maps
extract user data from the entire chumhum product suite--
search engine , e @-@ mails , chat sites ,
news feeds , shopping-- all of it .
chumhum is a fully integrated platform .
therefore our discovery shouldn &apos;t be limited to chummy maps alone .
it should include all of chumhum .
your honor , that &apos;s a hysterical escalation .
it would be a ridiculous amount of material .
good thing we can handle it .
to honor your discovery ruling , judge ,
we must see everything .
they &apos;re right , mrs. florrick .
full discovery of chumhum is granted .
who &apos;s side is the law on again ?
eli , i just had my ass handed to me in court .
i do not have the bandwidth for any campaign talk .
this is not about campaign talk .
okay .
i know you want me to ask you
why you are here , then .
but i &apos;m not going to .
jason is in your office , working .
seems like a nice guy .
he reminds me of ...
actually , he doesn &apos;t remind me of anyone .
very strong .
man of few words .
which is odd because most of the people i deal with who you know ...
use a lot of words .
yes .
i &apos;ve gotten over words .
how &apos;d you find jason ?
eli , what ?
what ?
what are you after ? what are you trying to say ?
i know your private life is none of my business ...
but when it begins to ... spill into your public life ...
you &apos;re telling me ,
when i sleep with jason you &apos;d rather i kept it private ?
you &apos;re joking ... right ?
you &apos;re making fun of me ?
okay , i think you are making fun of me ,
but i still need to be clear .
this is the speech i normally give to the candidate ,
but i will adapt it for you .
lucky me .
rule number one-- no touching in public .
ever .
if jason is on fire , let him burn .
touching in private-- no such thing .
nowhere is private anymore .
clearly .
rule number two-- if you have to go out together ,
make sure there &apos;s always a third party present ,
preferably female .
rule number three-- even if you go out in a bigger group ,
never , under any circumstances , let it be in a hotel , a bar ...
... or a hotel bar .
eli ...
you didn &apos;t talk about any of this with jason , did you ?
what ? ! no .
okay .
this is the first and last time
we discuss this .
i &apos;m not sleeping with my investigator , but if i were ,
this conversation between us could never take place .
i would never let it take place .
please just tell me you heard me .
no , eli , i didn &apos;t hear you .
i won &apos;t hear you .
you can show yourself out .
i &apos;m not sleeping with my investigator , but if i were ,
this conversation between us could never take place .
i would never let it take place .
please just tell me you heard me .
bad news-- they got full discovery .
okay .
new ball game .
yeah , a lot tougher one .
you want a drink ?
i &apos;m getting better at it .
no .
but thanks .
everything okay ?
no .
full discovery .
oh , right .
well , maybe we &apos;re just on the wrong side of this one .
maybe .
i &apos;ll see you .
the judge has granted full discovery .
now , this complicates our job , but it doesn &apos;t alter it .
we still split up the materials .
we still decide what is responsive and what is not .
okay , so , go to it .
we have a problem .
already ?
an e @-@ mail to chumhum customer service .
&quot; dear chumhum , your search results suck .
when i type in my name ,
it auto @-@ completes to some seriously racist crap . &quot;
what seriously racist crap ?
when he typed in his name-- jamal--
the auto @-@ complete offered to finish the sentence
with &quot; jamal stole my car , &quot; or
&quot; jamal arrest record . &quot;
okay , that &apos;s not good .
but it &apos;s non @-@ responsive .
really ?
how do you figure ?
it &apos;s customer based . i mean ,
the auto @-@ complete is based on most used search requests ,
so , obviously , more people who typed in &quot; jamal &quot;
were interested in arrest reports than anything else .
so , chumhum &apos;s not racist ... its users are ?
well , one could argue that it &apos;s racist to override the results .
okay , we need to deal with the &quot; animal &quot; incident .
i don &apos;t like the sound of that .
chumhum has photo @-@ identifying software .
it sorts your photos into categories .
camping trip , disneyland , graduation .
one of the customers pointed out that it had tagged photos of her friends .
alicia florrick was was willing to forgive her husband when he stumbled .
she deserves at least that much understanding .
and they put her on that election board , right ?
they wouldn &apos;t have done that if she hadn &apos;t turned herself around .
the election board , sure .
is there anything mrs. florrick has said
or done that influences your view of her ?
her episode of mama &apos;s homespun cooking .
it was so ... raw .
like she &apos;s a real person , with crap to deal with .
oh , this is good .
yeah .
eli ?
i &apos;ll be right back .
real people who have to overcome real issues in their life .
show of hands : how many of you would value those qualities
in a political candidate ?
i have a mission for you .
a mission ? really ?
sounds very ... mission @-@ like .
actually , it is .
mr. agos ?
cary &apos;s fine .
cary . i was checking up on the background
of the coders over at the chicago chumhum office .
which coders ?
kip o &apos;neill .
the guy who created the safe filter .
i went through his on @-@ line postings .
in 2013,
a year before he created the filter , he got mugged .
he didn &apos;t say where , but he said it was a &quot; sketchy neighborhood . &quot;
if he were mugged by ...
you can say it .
if he were mugged by african @-@ american people ,
it &apos;s evidence he was racially motivated in the creation of the filter .
good . do we know if he was mugged by african @-@ americans ?
no . i checked for news reports . nothing .
okay ... that &apos;s good work , brian .
that is pretty good work by biff ,
don &apos;t you think ?
it &apos;s really not my team--
imaging and tagging .
i &apos;ll bring josh over .
where &apos;s jason ? i thought he was meeting us here .
oh , yeah , he called .
he thought you might want to limit his hours on this ?
this is josh .
he can speak a little more specifically as to , uh ... yeah .
yeah . so ... the photo wasn &apos;t tagged by a person ,
it was tagged by an algorithm .
and the algorithm can &apos;t tell the difference
between an african @-@ american woman and an animal ?
well , it can now , but , uh ,
three years ago , we hadn &apos;t given it enough examples .
it had real trouble with light and shadow .
it got a lot of other stuff wrong , too .
just nothing else that looked so ...
racist ?
right .
it &apos;s gotten better . google had this problem , too .
did the algorithm
ever mistake a white person for an animal ?
why would it do that ?
because it mistakes white people for
polar bears or white seals .
no . not so far .
why not ?
why does it have trouble
identifying african @-@ americans ,
but not caucasians ?
i guess because we hadn &apos;t given it enough examples .
we &apos;re not racists .
i &apos;m not saying you are .
i &apos;m just looking around your workplace .
it &apos;s clearly responsive .
i disagree .
it &apos;s not racist . it &apos;s a technical shortcoming .
it &apos;s implicit bias .
look , no one at chumhum is actually racist .
they just code what they know .
that &apos;s why the tagging software
never misidentifies white people as animals .
the software has been corrected .
you yourself said no one there is actually racist .
this is non @-@ responsive . click it .
he &apos;s wrong .
he &apos;s also paying our bills ,
so , i think we have to click it .
nora , hi . eli &apos;s not here .
i know . the campaign sent me .
they sent you ? why ?
in case you need anything .
oh . well , i don &apos;t . i &apos;m fine .
back to the grindstone ?
yeah .
tough boss .
cary agos called . he wants to meet .
why ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe he wants to make a deal .
okay , give me second .
no , he just asked for me .
i &apos;ll call you .
i &apos;ll just wait in a corner , in case you need anything .
nora , i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s okay .
i have a book .
thanks for coming in , lucca .
anything to settle this .
we just found out one of your coders , kip o &apos;neill--
he was mugged in 2013 .
i wanted to see if you knew about this .
this is why i &apos;m here ?
yes .
he was mugged the year before he created safe filter
in what he called &quot; a sketchy neighborhood . &quot;
why call me ?
why not alicia ?
i thought you &apos;d be more helpful .
you &apos;re implying the assailants were black ?
i &apos;m not implying anything .
i thought you could ask your client .
next time ,
call alicia , too .
it just seems like something both our sides would need to address
if it turns out to be race @-@ related .
good @-@ bye .
it wasn &apos;t a negotiation .
we might have a problem with kip o &apos;neill .
okay , i got it . jason &apos;s here .
i &apos;ll ask him .
kip o &apos;neill was mugged in 2013 .
it &apos;s on his profile page .
we need to find out the race of the culprits .
all right . i &apos;ll see what i can do .
jason , did eli talk to you
before , when you were here ?
yup .
about us ?
what do you mean , &quot; us ? &quot;
us working together .
yes .
i don &apos;t want ...
things to be uncomfortable between us .
me , neither .
well , then , don &apos;t let eli
make them uncomfortable .
here &apos;s the thing :
i used to have a very different life .
a very ...
uncomfortable life .
i didn &apos;t like it .
so now , there is nothing i do
that makes me uncomfortable .
nothing .
even if i want something ...
is everything all right in here ?
do you need anything ?
we &apos;re fine , nora . thank you .
you said , &quot; even if you want something ... &quot; ?
yeah , you know , that &apos;s ...
it &apos;s okay .
jason ...
look , i just , i like things simple .
all right ? work simple , home simple , life simple .
and isn &apos;t it ?
it was .
i have to get back to work .
i &apos;ll call you .
how did we go from mugging victim to possible racist ?
if the guys who mugged him were black or latino ,
cary and diane will say racial bias
was motivation for the safe filter .
so cynical .
here he is .
so ?
good news .
the attackers were white , one was a redhead ,
so as long as that hasn &apos;t been categorized as a new race ...
we dodged a bullet .
what do you get when you cross a black and two mexicans ?
excuse me ?
it &apos;s a joke .
kip e @-@ mailed it to his teammates
four weeks before they launched chummy maps .
which i &apos;m guessing gives diane
and cary their bias .
damn .
i &apos;m not a racist .
and i &apos;m sure some
of your best friends are blacks and mexicans .
the joke was just me breaking up the drudge work .
apparently , work around here gets pretty drudgy .
there are dozens of these jokes here .
then you &apos;ve seen the white jokes , too .
that ... really doesn &apos;t help , kip .
look ... we work a hundred hours a week .
we sleep on the floor here half the nights .
it was a meta joke-- a joke about joking .
like dead baby jokes .
so they were just a bunch
of immature frat boys blowing off steam .
pretty much .
but it &apos;s gonna be hard
denying any knowledge of racism to judge marx .
you &apos;re right .
y ... you &apos;re finally agreeing with me .
it &apos;s been known to happen , alicia .
okay ...
then i will tag every chumhum e @-@ mail
with racist jokes &quot; responsive . &quot;
not just e @-@ mail .
tag every racist joke on the internet .
i &apos;m sure a chumhum search will turn up a billion web pages .
just mark all &quot; responsive . &quot;
you &apos;re gonna bury the e @-@ mails .
of course not .
i &apos;m just following the judge &apos;s directives .
this is their discovery ?
50 @-@ terabyte hard drive .
picture all the contents in the library of congress ,
and then multiply that by five .
congratulations-- we &apos;ve just been hit
with what may be the largest document dump
in american legal history .
go away . what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re supposed to be with alicia !
no , i &apos;m supposed to be working .
that was work .
no , that was
the most embarrassing thing i &apos;ve ever done , eli .
and i &apos;ve done your laundry .
where are they now ?
eli , they &apos;re not shtupping at 11 : 00 in the morning .
courtney can &apos;t know .
you are a horrible employee .
and you &apos;re a monster .
yeah , uh ... okay , yes ,
i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll see what i can do .
thank you so much .
everything all right ?
yes .
can i call you later ?
about the pac ?
about the pac .
eli .
you rang ?
what &apos;s this ?
a file on jason .
skeletons and such .
show it to alicia .
no .
it won &apos;t work .
you haven &apos;t read it .
alicia doesn &apos;t scare .
not when it comes to men .
all women scare .
use it .
here he is again .
what &apos;d you find , brian ?
i &apos;ve been going through the algorithms .
i thought you were digging through the discovery .
sometimes it &apos;s best to look in the math .
what &apos;d you find ?
a patch-- pretty crude , hastily done .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
it &apos;s embedded in the photo @-@ tagging software
it was altered so the word &quot; animal &quot;
could never appear in a photo tag .
why would they do that ?
to hide something ?
plaintiff has a motion to compel ?
we do .
this , uh , photo shows an african @-@ american woman
who was mistaken by chumhum &apos;s photo @-@ tagging software
and tagged as an &quot; animal . &quot;
yes , it does .
we discovered this photo when we noticed a patch
in chumhum &apos;s photo @-@ tagging algorithm .
a patch in the software ?
so it wouldn &apos;t happen again ?
yes , but rather than ...
fix the underlying problem ,
they simply ... patched it to prevent one instance
of the problem from recurring .
was this included in discovery ?
we don &apos;t know , your honor .
chumhum &apos;s counsel sent us 50 terabytes of discovery ,
it will take my firm
six years to work through it .
i see .
mrs. florrick ...
did you include this photo in discovery ?
no , your honor .
were you aware of the photo ?
we were , your honor ,
but we found it nonresponsive .
really ? so you found
50 terabytes of data responsive ...
but an african @-@ american woman being mistaken for an animal
didn &apos;t make the cut ?
we believed it did not .
no , you will provide
all responsive documents to plaintiff &apos;s attorneys today ,
and you have been found in contempt , ma &apos;am .
your honor , this was not my ...
you will pay $ 5,000
to the clerk of the circuit court
by end of day friday ,
as well as any plaintiff &apos;s costs and attorney &apos;s fees
incurred in pursuing this violation .
and if there are any more games like this ,
the sanctions will be doubled . you understand ?
i do , your honor .
all right , look ...
you have any more questions , you ask alicia , all right ?
i &apos;m a guest here .
i don &apos;t have a question .
good .
what &apos;s that ?
a file on you , from the campaign .
you serious ?
i &apos;m not , but the campaign is .
she knows all about my criminal record .
i don &apos;t pretend like it doesn &apos;t exist .
take a look at the back page .
does she know about that ?
why are you investigating alicia ?
it &apos;s none of your business .
actually , that part is .
i was going into business with her .
i wanted to know more about my prospective employer .
i don &apos;t believe you .
and i seriously don &apos;t give a damn .
this stuff ...
this is your life , it &apos;s not mine .
eli ...
do not make it mine .
now , get off my car .
okay , we &apos;re listening .
one , effective 9 : 00 a.m. this morning ,
josh shelby &apos;s employment at chumhum was terminated .
the photo coder ?
yes .
two , the safe filter has been changed from a default setting
to an opt @-@ in-- users will have to activate it
if they want to know areas to avoid .
and the business icons should not be switched off .
we agree .
fine .
and how much you offer ?
zero .
we were under the impression
this was a settlement offer .
these are little dokebi &apos;s
financial records .
the restaurant was struggling .
ms. feldman was slashing costs
almost as much as 35 %
because business was going soft .
she started doing this two months ...
before the safe filter went live .
restaurant business 101 , ms. feldman--
your business tanked because you skimped on quality .
mr. canning ...
that &apos;s not true .
how did you even get these documents ?
ms. feldman stored them
on chumhum &apos;s cloud @-@ based spreadsheet service .
which is private ...
actually ,
users authorize chumhum total access
when they agree to the terms of service .
it was a free service .
divya probably wanted to save some money .
mr. canning ...
i have never skimped in my life .
sorry , but i &apos;m not sure what we can do .
so your client isn &apos;t racist-- they &apos;re just omnipotent .
keeping us all safe .
you want to celebrate ?
in what manner ?
in any manner you desire .
so , is this your place ?
let &apos;s go dance .
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t really dance .
too bad .
screw it .
i &apos;m sorry to bother you so late .
no .
we need to talk about jason .
no , we don &apos;t .
he has a file on you .
what does that mean ?
he has a personal file on you .
he has looked into your past .
