back in the &apos; 80s ,
this is what gaming looked like .
just a fold @-@ out board , assorted plastic pieces ,
and a pop @-@ o @-@ matic bubble .
the competition was fierce ,
and there were no bigger rivals than my brother and sister .
board games gave them an outlet to channel their anger .
don &apos;t mess up !
paging dr. sucks at operation .
come in , dr. sucks at operation .
sure , winning felt good .
f @-@ 1 .
but the real prize was gloating as you crushed
the loser &apos;s fragile spirit .
you sank my battleship .
i @-@ i can &apos;t hear you .
you sank my battleship .
look at me in the eye when you say it !
erica had smarts and strategy .
barry had trash talk
and a psychotic desire to win no matter the game ,
even girl talk .
&quot; the last digit of your phone number
indicates how many boys you will kiss . &quot;
six ! yes ! girl talk !
they were worthy adversaries
until a new board game changed everything .
check it out ! it &apos;s called trivial pursuit .
yes ! a new game to dominate .
okay . &quot; sports and leisure .
what team has won the most stanley cup championships ? &quot;
montreal canadiens .
swish , baby . this game is too easy .
&quot; arts and literature .
whose autobiographical masterpiece was entitled
&apos;long day &apos;s journey into night &apos; ? &quot;
pass ! sports again .
not how it works , dummy . my turn .
&quot; what sailor &apos;s disease resulted from a deficiency of vitamin c ? &quot;
mm , scurvy ?
correct .
looks like someone &apos;s gonna be tough to beat .
the game was simple .
you either knew the answer or you didn &apos;t ,
and barry didn &apos;t .
for the first time ever ,
the scales were tipped firmly to erica .
oh , this one &apos;s super easy .
&quot; who wrote &apos; the diary of anne frank &apos; ? &quot;
seriously ?
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s called &quot; the diary of anne frank . &quot;
don &apos;t help me ! i know what the answer is !
it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s ...
aah ! i @-@ i hate this !
who &apos;s up for girl talk ?
was november 12 , 1980 @-@ something .
i was in gym class ,
and today &apos;s lesson to nurture the young blossoming athlete --
scooter ball .
it was a lot like soccer
except with an 80 % better chance of injury .
my fingers !
i &apos;m so sorry ! he &apos;s hurt !
scoot it off !
the overlord of this insanity was mr. mellor ,
a gung @-@ ho ex @-@ jock filled with stupid sports clich√©s .
no pain , no gain !
there is no &quot; i &quot; in team !
winners never quit ! quitters never win !
and some of his sayings we just found confusing .
it is never okay to put butter on a doughnut !
dance like no one &apos;s watching !
love like you &apos;ve never been hurt !
don &apos;t trust your cousin on a road trip with your wife .
all right !
think you guys are ready
for the apex of rubber @-@ ball @-@ based sports .
dodgeball .
for kids like me ,
this was our waking nightmare from which there was no escape .
grab a ball !
same teams . on my whistle .
this is bad .
i want the &quot; star wars &quot; theme played at my funeral .
what are you guys doing ? posing for a trophy ?
let &apos;s go !
it wasn &apos;t pretty ,
but as much as dodgeball hurt me ,
it hurt someone else even more .
my schmoopies are home .
who did this to your kissable face ? !
mom , please don &apos;t . i &apos;m fine .
who ? i want names .
it &apos;s from dodgeball . mr. mellor lives for it .
it &apos;s like his air .
it &apos;s like a violation of human rights .
here we go .
bevy , it &apos;s not a rights violation .
it &apos;s gym class .
well , i think he &apos;s an animal .
how much does it hurt , schmoo ?
on a pain scale from 1 to 10 , how much ?
i &apos;d say fi--
three ...
one ? one .
it should be zero .
i also would have accepted the word &quot; nothing . &quot;
i &apos;m marching down there first thing .
bevy , no .
they don &apos;t need your angry rants on how to educate .
mom , please don &apos;t make a thing out this .
you got to let teachers teach .
i don &apos;t want to be on his bad side .
don &apos;t worry about him .
he doesn &apos;t want to be on my bad side ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s much badder .
it really was .
my mom marched down to school so often that the teachers
could almost sense she was coming .
don &apos;t worry , cinoman . today &apos;s not your day .
i &apos;m here for mellor .
third door on the left .
cute top .
you want me to cancel dodgeball ,
one of the seven pillars of fitness ?
what are the other six ?
look , canceling dodgeball would be like canceling science .
is that what you want ? a world with no science ?
why do you hate nasa ? why ?
i don &apos;t hate it . they gave us tang .
what i do hate is dodgeball .
dodgeball is an essential part
of strengthening a young man &apos;s character ,
and nobody needs that more than your son .
how dare you ?
my son has the strength and character
of three lou ferrignos !
how dare you invoke lou ferrigno ?
how dare you ? !
i &apos;m not gonna stand here and let you push me around !
i &apos;m not scared of you .
well , you should be .
i &apos;d think twice about this if i were you .
no . i will not think at all .
if there &apos;s any more dodgeball in this school ,
you will regret it .
mark my words .
i will mark no words .
mark them !
while my mom was putting a stop to the game she hated ,
barry was ready to give the game he sucked at another try .
oh , hello . i did not see you sitting there .
we &apos;re not sitting .
what you &apos;re doing is called sitting .
potato , potato .
care for a rematch , erica ?
and crush your fragile spirit again ?
gladly .
um , i don &apos;t think i want to be here for this .
you shall witness the battle , old man !
i mean ...
i cherish our time together .
please , sit .
ooh . science and nature . challenging .
&quot; what animal does a hippophobe fear ? &quot;
horses .
the answer is horses .
that &apos;s right .
yellow . ooh . history .
&quot; how many children does queen elizabeth -- &quot;
four .
you sure seem to know a lot of stuff all of a sudden .
there &apos;s no reason to be &quot; patronibing . &quot;
okay , next card .
&quot; what city was called the paris of the south ? &quot;
maya angelou .
that &apos;s the answer
on the card you wanted me to choose , you knob .
you &apos;re clearly cheating .
how dare you ? ! i am a sportsman !
you insult my honor !
hey , bar , i @-@ i @-@ it &apos;s kind of obvious you &apos;re cheating .
i am not . i simply memorized the answers
and put the cards in a particular order so i can win !
that &apos;s cheating !
that &apos;s preparation !
preparation for cheating .
don &apos;t blame me !
this game is impossible and has no point !
what &apos;s the point of mouse trap ?
to boot a marble down a flight of stairs
onto a slide and into a bathtub , which , in turn ,
another balls falls onto a see @-@ saw ,
back flipping an old man into a kiddie pool ,
causing a trap to fall on a mouse ! duh !
that he knows .
face it -- this is one game you can &apos;t win .
say i &apos;m better than you . say it .
never !
i will do everything in my power to learn knowledge .
i will go to school , and i will read books ,
and i will study art ,
and i will drink in life
just so i can beat you at this board game !
he should probably do all that stuff regardless .
ladies and gentlemen ,
due to aggressive parental interference ,
there &apos;s been a change in the phys @-@ ed curriculum .
what ? could be any of our moms .
effective immediately ,
there will no longer be dodgeball in my class .
instead , we &apos;ll play an all @-@ new safer , kinder game
called big baby ball .
we &apos;ll choose teams by counting off ones and twos .
goldfarb , begin .
one .
everybody else is a two .
let &apos;s get the ones on that side , twos on the other .
mr. mellor , is it too late to switch my number to two ?
well , your mother demanded that we play something else ,
so you can let her know that her voice was heard today .
good luck and cover your nards .
i was in a tight spot ,
so i decided my only choice was to fight my way out .
why ? !
i don &apos;t know !
sorry .
i don &apos;t understand . mellor didn &apos;t cower ?
why didn &apos;t he cower ?
it &apos;s on you , bev .
the boy was singled out because you mixed in .
he &apos;s right , mom . you made it worse .
why can &apos;t you ever listen ?
you want to protect the boy ,
and you always end up making it a million times worse .
no , you &apos;re completely right .
i know it in my heart .
good . it &apos;s nice to finally be on the same page .
definitely .
what &apos;s with the coat ?
are you marching down to school again ? !
i want to say no , but that would be a lie .
but i thought we &apos;re on the same page .
we are , and yet , here i go .
just stop !
just tell your body to stop !
i want to . i really want to .
but i can &apos;t .
i thought we &apos;re on the same page !
and the next item of business is scheduling teacher conferences .
blonde monster .
nothing .
mrs. goldberg , this is a private meeting .
not anymore . got to go , people !
don &apos;t care where . just not here .
don &apos;t leave . she looks really mad .
i &apos;m sorry , earl .
mr. mellor is no longer with william penn academy
due to a concern raised by a parent ...
who shall remain nameless .
this one &apos;s tough to deny .
thanks to my mother , i got out of dodgeball .
all it took was ruining a man &apos;s life .
oh . hello , again .
i did not see you sitting there .
again , you &apos;re the one sitting .
potato , tomato .
come sit . i &apos;ve been thinking .
we &apos;ve completely lost track of what board games
are all about -- family fun .
that &apos;s why i invented a new gaming experience
for the whole family to enjoy .
i call it ...
barry @-@ nopoly .
&quot; do a freestyle rap as good as big tasty
or nunchuck better than barry &quot; ?
i &apos;ve made sure it caters to all our strengths .
for you , trivia . physical challenges for myself .
and for pops , frequent bathroom breaks .
i like this game .
you actually created
a board game that only you can win .
do you realize how sad that is ?
does this mean you forfeit and i &apos;m reigning champion forever ?
no . i &apos;ll play .
and i &apos;ll literally beat you at your own game .
let &apos;s do this ! what &apos;ll it be , pops ?
rap or an elaborate nunchuck routine ?
i have to go to the bathroom .
40 bonus points for pops !
i really like this game .
okay , your turn .
&quot; arm @-@ wrestle barry . &quot;
easy .
you &apos;re so hosed .
am i , now ?
have you ever heard of
a little sylvester stallone arm @-@ wrestling drama
called &quot; over the top &quot; ?
no .
well , you &apos;re about to live it .
go .
oh , no ! he &apos;s losing !
or is he ?
over the top !
what are you doing ? !
going over the top !
what are you doing ? !
i &apos;m going over the top !
you can &apos;t go over the top !
i &apos;m going over the top !
i &apos;m going over your top !
yes ! yes ! in your face !
this game is rigged !
it &apos;s your game , and i still beat you !
say it .
i &apos;m better than you in every way .
fine ! you &apos;re better than me .
you &apos;re smart and you &apos;re cool and everyone likes you .
and i &apos;m nothing .
congrats .
for the first time ever ,
crushing barry didn &apos;t feel like such a triumph .
meanwhile , my dad stumbled upon another man down on his luck ,
coach mellor .
oh , god .
you need a curb painted , hoss ?
suggested donation $ 5 .
yeah , actually , i &apos;m adam goldberg &apos;s father .
oh . so your wife is ...
yeah , blonde monster .
love her dearly .
so , is this what you &apos;re doing for money ?
for now .
turns out there &apos;s not a great demand
for a phys @-@ ed specialist in the middle of the school year .
i don &apos;t mean to tell you your business ,
but i don &apos;t think that &apos;s the right address .
it is not . i lost my 3 .
you know , i know my wife can get carried away with things ,
and i just want to let you know , i &apos;m really sorry about all this .
don &apos;t be .
your wife plays hard . i respect a winner .
she &apos;s a good woman who does not know the word &quot; quit , &quot;
although she does know the word &quot; fired . &quot;
can i give you a ride somewhere ? maybe a hot meal ?
that &apos;s very kind of you ,
but i only got about 10 more blocks to go ,
and i got a fanny pack full of turkey jerky , so ...
i told you , i don &apos;t want the numbers !
it &apos;s donation only ! just pay what &apos;s fair !
you know what ? he &apos;s getting the hose . you better open up .
those are fresh numbers !
where &apos;s the 3 ? !
i got to tell u ,
he &apos;s not the same guy
without the whistle and the short @-@ shorts .
a guy like that belongs in a gym yelling at kids .
it &apos;s in his blood .
look , i never intended for mellor to get fired ,
but this is on him . he singled out my boy .
okay , he was wrong , but you took it too far .
now do the right thing and put that loose cannon
back in charge of children .
i go easy on one teacher , then the rest won &apos;t fear me .
fine . you won &apos;t help the poor bastard , i will .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
mr. g , i really appreciate this opportunity .
you got my word , i will give you 110 % .
call me murray .
110 % , that is not necessary .
on a good day , the best vic gives me is what ? 50 % ?
there he goes , busting balls .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s what we do .
no . what we do is sell furniture .
bring it in . &quot; furniture &quot; on three .
yeah , okay , what vic and i do is we sell the furniture ,
and what i need you to do is to move the coffee table
over by the sofa set .
sir , yes , sir ! time me .
whoa , whoa it &apos;s not a race .
take your time .
one , two , three .
that &apos;s oak . that &apos;s heavy . i thought it was pine .
excuse me , sir .
excuse me .
is this in stock ?
yes , it is .
and you can have that in your house today .
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s -- it &apos;s kind of pricey .
tell you what .
you pay cash , i &apos;ll take off 5 % .
i &apos;ll just come back another time .
there is no other time .
clock &apos;s winding down . ball &apos;s in your hands .
you gonna put the ball in the hole ,
or you gonna go home a loser ?
i don &apos;t really understand what &apos;s happening right now .
he &apos;s new .
we &apos;re team players in this store .
we don &apos;t sell to anybody who doesn &apos;t pass the ball .
you keep referencing a @-@ a ball .
is it the same ball ?
let me make it simple .
there &apos;s no &quot; i &quot; in team , man .
we only sell to winners , so get the out !
i am sorry !
what ? !
okay . we need to talk .
sure thing , boss .
what are you doing ?
taking a knee .
just take an early lunch .
you got it , boss .
juice time .
so many bananas and beets .
let &apos;s go .
yeah !
finally got some energy ! let &apos;s go !
so , before , that was him without energy ?
after my dad &apos;s horrible day at work ,
he had to face an even worse night at home .
hey , could i , uh , have some ranch dressing for my salad ?
oh , of course , honey .
when .
that &apos;s what you get for hiring the enemy to work in our store .
don &apos;t worry about mellor .
you &apos;re not gonna see him .
he &apos;s working all the way across town .
hey , boss !
sorry to interrupt !
it &apos;s me -- rick mellor ! i work for you !
i can see you &apos;re eating dinner .
oh , is that lamb ? !
that looks like lamb .
what are you doing ? you &apos;re supposed to be out making deliveries .
yeah , well , here &apos;s the thing .
i decided to do all this week &apos;s drop @-@ offs in one day .
i told you , you can &apos;t load that much furniture
on the truck at once .
i thought you said that because you believed i couldn &apos;t do it !
and i proved you wrong .
but i broke the truck .
fine . where is it ?
it &apos;s a couple blocks down . address is 466 .
although the actual address is 366 .
haven &apos;t been my best this week .
balls ! he &apos;s come for me !
he &apos;s seeking vengeance !
no vengeance . no .
i just came to apologize to your old man for breaking his truck .
but while i got you here ,
i guess i owe you both an apology myself .
i -- mrs. g , you &apos;re a strong woman ,
and i respect the hell out of you .
do you ?
do you ? !
thanks .
and , adam ,
i was dead wrong to single you out .
the truth is , i &apos;m only hard on you &apos; cause i &apos;m rooting for you .
really ?
you know , as you get older ,
you &apos;ll realize that life ain &apos;t easy and things fly at you
that are a lot harder than a stupid red rubber ball .
and i just want you to learn
that you &apos;re strong enough to face it
and there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t overcome .
in that moment ,
i realized my biggest foe was really my biggest advocate .
well , enjoy your dinner .
wait . are you hungry ? i could fix you a plate .
a plate ?
hell , just point me to the blender .
oh , hello . i did not see you sitting there .
i agree .
so , i was thinking ,
how about one more game of trivial pursuit ,
winner takes all ?
so you can take all ? no , thanks .
okay , how about this ?
if you can beat me ,
then trivial pursuit is banned forever from this house .
sounds awesome .
the only problem is , i can &apos;t win .
&quot; who had an encounter with the three bears ? &quot;
goldilocks .
that &apos;s right .
game on !
as fate would have it , that game ,
barry knew every question my sister threw at him .
it was as if he was suddenly the smartest man on the planet .
or erica was picking cards from the little kid &apos;s edition ,
suggested ages 8 through 12 .
cookie monster ! pigeons !
the number 4 . trees .
purple . turtles .
that &apos;s the one .
clouds . beanstalk . unicorn . butterflies .
santa .
can i a full name on that ?
santa claus .
okay . this one &apos;s for the win .
&quot; what has the scientific formula h2o ? &quot;
water ! it &apos;s water !
i &apos;m the smartest man alive ! say i &apos;m better than you .
you &apos;re better than me .
i &apos;m all right ! yes !
way to go , kiddo .
yeah , well , he needed the win .
sometimes the best way to get the win is to lose ,
and other times , you just have to admit defeat .
well , i would consider bringing mr. mellor back
on one condition .
you don &apos;t step foot in this school ever again .
one year .
deal .
my mom wasn &apos;t many things , but she was a woman of her word .
that year , she never went back to school to complain .
sorry to interrupt , earl ...
but technically this isn &apos;t school ,
and i do have bones to pick .
ooh , is that brisket ?
although winning never came easy to me ...
mr. mellor actually did end up teaching me
how to duck anything life might throw at me .
okay . you rolled a 2 .
now cruise down the big tasty river and draw a barry card .
oh . your face is on these .
i love this game .
&quot; roundhouse kick better than barry . &quot;
better than my kara @-@ te master ? it can &apos;t be done .
right answer !
50 points !
challenge card .
&quot; arm @-@ wrestle barry . &quot;
oh , we get to hold hands .
oh , you &apos;re even turning your hat backwards .
how macho .
go !
over the top !
that &apos;s how you do it !
let &apos;s go ! let &apos;s go !
you &apos;re so strong , honey .
i ... know i am so ... strong .
let &apos;s go , barry !
oh , i &apos;m so proud of you , honey ,
the way you beat mommy like that .
i &apos;m the best !
let him win , huh ?
he needs it .
