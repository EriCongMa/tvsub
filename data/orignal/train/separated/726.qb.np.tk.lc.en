i wanna be with you . i want us to have that chance .
it &apos;s spread . stage iv lymphoma .
how long ? how m ... how many years ?
not years . months .
where &apos;s victoria ?
i don &apos;t know anything .
and i don &apos;t believe you .
i know how victoria pulled this off .
she made it look like i attacked her in a parking garage .
she staged her penthouse to look like she was assaulted ,
making the world believe that i was a monster
who burned the queen alive .
we have dental records and x @-@ rays .
she switched them with a woman named mary gaines .
i found the hoodie that victoria said
emily was wearing when she attacked her .
you told detective hunter this ?
i need to retain your services immediately .
you are alive .
when i was a little girl ,
the delineation between good and evil
was as clear as night and day .
but as life grows complicated ,
that line blurs , and we learn to justify our actions
when we believe we &apos;ve crossed it .
if we aren &apos;t careful ,
those choices can fill us with darkness ,
leaving us destined to never see light again .
you &apos;re getting pretty good at that .
what &apos;s wrong , sweetheart ?
why are there bad people , daddy ?
is this about the crash you saw on the tv ?
the flight 197 ?
i don &apos;t think that people are born bad .
i think it &apos;s their choices that make them who they are .
i think sometimes people convince themselves
that doing something bad is okay .
what if i do that ?
you would never .
you always listen to your heart .
and if you ever go off the path ,
dad &apos;s gonna be there to bring you back .
promise .
detective ?
do you know when ben hunter &apos;s coming in this morning ?
he &apos;s not .
okay , well , this afternoon ...
detective hunter is dead .
what ?
no .
no , i can &apos;t believe that .
if you had anything to do with this ,
i &apos;m gonna find out .
did anyone recognize you ?
nobody batted an eye .
and why would they ?
victoria grayson &apos;s dead .
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re safe .
thanks to you .
i told her to get you out of there before ben found you .
i never expected her to ...
i know that .
what that woman did to ben was horrific .
now all we can hope is that no more blood will be shed .
right ?
i &apos;ve arranged it so that you can stay hidden here
in our new headquarters until tomorrow ,
when you &apos;ll board a private jet to montpellier .
this all started
when amanda clarke changed her identity .
and now it ends with me changing mine .
did you speak to charlotte and patrick ?
they &apos;ve been invited to the funeral .
victoria ...
you know , until emily is convicted
and you &apos;re safely abroad , you cannot contact them .
well ...
it wouldn &apos;t make any difference .
i wrote and phoned charlotte so many times .
but i never got a response .
you know better than anyone how complicated
the relationship between a mother and a daughter can be .
even more than you realize .
the corpse i passed off as my own
was my mother .
all rise .
court is now in session .
the honorable judge jesse moss presiding .
please be seated .
amanda ,
are you absolutely sure about this ?
i &apos;m positive .
i see both counsel are present .
let &apos;s get started , shall we ?
your honor , on behalf of my client ,
i &apos;d like to thank you for agreeing to this hearing .
this had better be warranted , ms. clarke .
it is , your honor .
well , enlighten us then , would you ?
my father once said that no one is born bad ,
that ... it &apos;s our choices that define who we are .
by those standards ,
both myself and victoria grayson are far from saints .
but only one of us crossed a line ...
that we can &apos;t come back from .
your honor , she &apos;s making unfounded claims
about the victim &apos;s character before the trial &apos;s even begun .
get to the point , ms. clarke .
i requested to come before the court today
because there is something you need to know .
i am guilty of the murder of victoria grayson .
what on earth are you doing ? why did you plead guilty ?
ben is dead .
what ?
he was killed last night , in his home .
they &apos;re saying it was an accident ,
but i don &apos;t believe that .
he was murdered ,
and it &apos;s my fault .
so you admit to killing victoria ?
that doesn &apos;t make sense .
i did it , dad .
you &apos;re lying .
you would never kill anyone . that &apos;s not who you are .
i don &apos;t care if they &apos;re listening .
i lost 20 years of my life for something i didn &apos;t do .
you can &apos;t give up now .
i don &apos;t wanna spend what &apos;s left of my life without you .
that &apos;s it , clarke . time &apos;s up .
can you just give us five more minutes , please ?
i love you .
amanda . amanda !
emily &apos;s a genius .
how is pleading guilty
to a murder you didn &apos;t commit smart ?
oh , after my incarceration ,
i decided that we needed a plan in place if ...
well , more likely &quot; when , &quot;
one of us ended up getting arrested again .
so i boned up on all the specs and security
for every hoosegow in a 200 @-@ mile radius .
so ... emily pled guilty so she could be moved
into a maximum security prison ?
where we &apos;re gonna move her out .
your mother did unspeakable things to you , victoria .
i thought you &apos;d banished her from your life .
i did .
and in the eight years since ,
i &apos;ve tried never to give her a second thought .
but the night after amanda destroyed me ,
i received an unexpected call .
victoria .
i didn &apos;t expect you &apos;d show .
well , if i hadn &apos;t ,
you &apos;d have thought yourself the bigger person .
well , couldn &apos;t have that , could we ?
i know you think
i was a horrible mother .
and that after you ... humiliated me that thanksgiving ,
i bet you hoped i &apos;d ...
curl up and die .
i loved you , mother ...
so much that i took the fall for the murder that you committed ,
hoping that one day you would love me back .
and instead , when i was released to you ,
i found that lecherous man in our home ,
waiting for me .
i didn &apos;t ask you here to fight .
i changed my name so ...
there &apos;d be no chance you could hurt me again .
and imagine my surprise when i ...
i saw on television that girl
that you forced to do the same thing .
i heard about daniel &apos;s passing ,
that charlotte is in rehab ...
again .
i even heard about ...
your bastard ...
who abandoned you
just like you abandoned him .
so now you tell me , victoria .
who was the better mother ?
i must &apos;ve inherited my heart from my father .
you owe me the truth . who was he ?
didn &apos;t you recognize him , victoria ?
that lecherous man
that you seduced into your bed ...
you ...
you are a cruel , loathsome bitch
who deserves to burn in hell .
well , then ...
we &apos;ll continue this conversation ...
there .
it was only in death
that my mother could finally do something good
for her daughter .
you &apos;re the only family i have left ,
thanks to amanda .
i &apos;m here for you .
but she is still a threat .
the only reason for her to confess
is that she &apos;s up to something .
well , whatever her next move ,
i will go to my grave
before i allow her to hurt my children again .
mascelli , where &apos;s the fire ?
it could be anywhere !
open &apos; em up ! all of &apos; em ! do it !
you know ...
a most distinct sensation of dejavu .
just sayin &apos; .
thanks for being here .
wouldn &apos;t be anywhere else .
well , after the number i did on their security system ,
we should have plenty of time .
what &apos;s our next move ?
a spot just opened up at bedford hills correctional .
i &apos;m gonna find victoria and put her in it .
anyone who believes
will not come under judgment ,
but has passed from death to life .
the hour &apos;s coming when the dead will hear
the voice of the son of god
and all who hear ...
i can &apos;t believe they didn &apos;t show .
victoria deserved better .
praise to you , lord jesus christ .
most people think
they knew who victoria grayson was .
the strong queen of the hamptons .
but they &apos;re wrong .
victoria &apos;s tough exterior was merely an armor
built up to protect a heart
whose capacity to love was unmatched .
i know this ...
because she opened it up to me ,
embracing me as her own .
the loss of victoria grayson
is a tragedy .
but the real tragedy is that so few
got to experience the intensity with which she loved .
i consider myself blessed
having been a recipient of that love .
and i can only hope that while she was alive ,
she felt i returned it in kind .
thank you .
ben would &apos;ve come here from the morgue
when he realized that mary gaines &apos; body was missing .
but there &apos;s no sign that he was here .
well , maybe victoria &apos;s henchman killed him
before he had a chance .
who the hell is mary gaines , anyway ?
oh , my god .
what ?
it &apos;s her mother .
victoria burned her own mother &apos;s corpse in the fire .
that &apos;s insane .
tell me you have something .
what , other than
your great escape trending on twitter ?
i didn &apos;t think they &apos;d admit to losing me so quickly .
we gotta move .
you &apos;re not going anywhere , miss america &apos;s most wanted !
look , i can &apos;t get you out if you get arrested again ,
so just sit tight .
i &apos;ll talk to you later .
what is it ?
the floor was just cleaned ,
but only in this area .
what &apos;s that look like to you ?
ben wasn &apos;t killed at home .
it happened here .
where have you been ?
don &apos;t worry . no one saw me , not even you .
you were at your own funeral ?
i &apos;m trying to protect you .
why must you insist on making it so difficult ? !
i &apos;m sorry ...
but i wanted to see my children for one last time .
but apparently , they didn &apos;t have the same desire .
oh , victoria .
louise did .
i cannot allow someone who cares about me
to languish away in unnecessary mourning .
bring her to me . i have to tell her the truth .
you &apos;re putting our lives in the hands of an unstable woman .
you heard her eulogy . she &apos;s devoted to me .
your journey is in enough jeopardy as it is .
victoria , emily is coming for us .
well , i knew this wasn &apos;t over .
but there &apos;s one course of action we can take .
no .
no , it &apos;s out of the question .
i won &apos;t be a part of any more bloodshed .
margaux , i never wanted amanda clarke dead .
i want her to be in solitary confinement
for the rest of her life .
your contact can capture and put her there .
i say we make a run for it .
every second we &apos;re not tracking victoria ,
she gets further away .
nolan said to sit tight ,
so that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .
we need to rest .
when was the last time you actually slept ?
we &apos;re not safe here , jack . i &apos;m not gonna sleep .
you &apos;re safe .
i &apos;m here .
you know , when i started all of this ,
i didn &apos;t know ...
someone was gonna figure out what i was doing if ...
if i would fail , if the whole thing would fall apart .
remember that day ...
i ran into you and sammy in the park ?
suddenly , i felt like ...
everything was gonna be okay .
you &apos;ve always made me feel safe , jack .
i know things ...
got complicated since then with aiden and amanda ...
but i never stopped feeling that way when i was around you .
i guess i &apos;m just scared .
this whole mess isn &apos;t over yet , and i don &apos;t know
how it &apos;s gonna end .
neither do i.
but i know
that i won &apos;t let it end ...
without this .
the remains were too burnt for d.n.a. ,
so all we had to go on were the teeth we recovered .
but the coroner checked her dental records .
it &apos;s definitely victoria grayson .
you know , i don &apos;t think victoria would &apos;ve appreciated
you pulling me out of her funeral reception early .
you need to stop burying your feelings , margaux .
i don &apos;t understand how you can be so cold .
you will .
hello , poppet .
louise , you are a treasured part of my family .
then why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because i couldn &apos;t risk implicating you
in case something had gone awry .
and now i realize the error of my ways .
i am so sorry .
i just ...
i don &apos;t understand . where will you go ?
someplace you cannot come .
but i promise , we will be reunited one day .
until then ,
i need you to keep up the charade .
for me .
of course .
mama .
now i &apos;ve been looking into margaux &apos;s finances ,
and she recently wired a lot of money
into someone &apos;s encrypted account in the caymans .
maybe that &apos;s for victoria . it could lead us right to her .
i thought the same thing ,
but the account &apos;s been open for years ,
receiving large sums from all over the globe .
i think i may have figured out who it belongs to .
the f.b.i. have been trying to pin down
a mercenary who calls herself &quot; white gold . &quot;
most people don &apos;t even believe she exists , but ...
wait . hang on .
what is it ?
david , margaux just cut the ghost assassin
another check .
ems .
i got it , nolan .
wait . got what , ems ?
evidence that victoria switched the bodies .
no , no , no . that &apos;s great , but ...
i found her mother &apos;s original dental records . it &apos;s all here .
emily !
look , you &apos;re in danger , girl .
margaux paid a hit woman to take out ben ,
and you are next .
that &apos;s why i told you to stay at the house .
you &apos;re safe there .
no , we &apos;re not .
ben was killed there .
if the assassin finds out , she &apos;ll retrace her steps .
then you need to get as far away from that house as possible .
jack &apos;s still there . i &apos;m not just gonna leave him .
i &apos;m going back .
no , hey , all right .
you know what ? emily , we &apos;re sending the police right now .
do not go back there .
you do , you &apos;re either caught or you &apos;re dead .
emily ?
emily ?
either you tell me where amanda is and you die ,
or you don &apos;t tell me and you die slower .
go to hell .
bad call .
move , move !
sir , can you hear me ?
we got a man down in here .
send &apos; em up asap .
hang in there , sir .
help is on its way .
come on .
hang in , buddy .
something wrong ?
ems !
this place is crawling with cops .
i don &apos;t care .
by the time i got to marion &apos;s house ,
they were loading him in the ambulance . i had to see him .
please don &apos;t leave me .
i need you .
i &apos;m not gonna put victoria in prison .
i &apos;m gonna put her in the ground .
and don &apos;t you dare try to stop me .
i won &apos;t .
do it .
i &apos;m gonna take care of the bitch margaux paid to do this .
nolan , you can &apos;t . she &apos;s dangerous .
so am i.
i trained for four years
with the most dangerous sensei i know .
i can handle her .
we still have to find victoria .
we don &apos;t know where she &apos;s hiding .
i do .
it &apos;s no use , margaux .
you can &apos;t escape this .
how did you get in here ? leave now .
doesn &apos;t matter if you admit it or not .
i have proof ...
that you hired the mercenary
that murdered ben ,
put jack in the hospital .
jack ?
w @-@ what happened ? is he all right ?
he is in critical condition , thanks to you .
i never wanted anyone to get hurt .
i was only trying to put emily back behind bars
where she belongs .
and where do you belong , margaux ? hmm ?
you and emily are far from innocent .
i know the crimes you &apos;ve committed for her .
can &apos;t you see that you and i are the same ?
everything we &apos;ve done
was out of loyalty to the people we love .
and you crossed a line and you know it !
you took a life !
hey , i &apos;ve lost people , too !
my father ! daniel ! i lost my own child !
and it doesn &apos;t matter how hard we try .
we can &apos;t get them back .
we can &apos;t undo what we &apos;ve done .
someone once told me that ...
it &apos;s our decisions
that define who we are .
well ...
you &apos;ve still got a decision to make .
david ?
jack . oh , thank god .
how you feelin &apos; ?
where &apos;s amanda ?
no , no , no . hey .
easy .
nolan left me a message , said that she was okay .
i &apos;ll ...
i &apos;ll let the doctor know that you &apos;re awake .
so she can check you out .
david ?
yeah ?
do you remember when amanda and i were ...
were kids , and she made us have
that little wedding on the beach ?
with the ...
the pipe cleaner rings , right ?
yeah .
how could i forget that ?
you approved of us back then .
would you still approve today ?
jack , you had a rough day .
no . i &apos;m serious , david .
when this is all over , i wanna marry your daughter .
but i was hoping to have your blessing .
well ...
you have it .
i can &apos;t imagine leaving amanda in better hands than yours .
louise .
please stop .
i am done listening to you .
you have been using me this whole time .
i am nothing but a pawn to you .
no , poppet , i love you .
i never wanted to hurt you .
but you did .
and there &apos;s someone else you hurt much more .
hello , victoria .
nolan ross is the perfect bait .
put him in danger , and amanda will come .
you should consider putting me on retainer , lady marmalade .
this will be the last time , i assure you .
that &apos;s what they all say .
you closed ?
bummer .
could sure use a shot .
well , i can make an exception .
what &apos;s your poison ?
bourbon .
now ... with your free hand ,
you &apos;re gonna call your bestie amanda
and you &apos;re gonna let her know that her presence is required .
you know the best thing about white gold ?
it &apos;s an excellent conductor .
oh , mon dieu ! nolan !
it &apos;ll be all right .
i &apos;ll take a knife to the hand over 70,000 volts any day .
here . check my front jacket pocket .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s her cayman account info .
it &apos;s tied to records of every fatal accident
she &apos;s ever staged .
don &apos;t worry . i removed the connection to you .
i already called the police .
they &apos;ll be here in five minutes .
margaux , you should go .
no , i &apos;m staying .
i started this to get justice for daniel .
he once told me not to abandon my soul like he had .
he redeemed his by saving a life .
i need to honor him and redeem mine .
wait .
so you &apos;re just gonna give yourself up ?
if it &apos;s our decisions that define who we are ,
then this is who i am .
before you fire , please know
that like your televised assassination ,
your real one will be there for all the world to see .
i installed these cameras
when i heard that you had escaped ,
because i knew that you would find your way here .
so you &apos;ll be going away for good once you pull that trigger .
you never really have been able to , have you ?
oh , for once , you &apos;re right about something , victoria .
unlike you , i &apos;ve never killed anybody .
i believe that the people who hurt my family
deserve to live in agony ,
not pay with their lives .
but you ...
you are the one exception . for you ,
death is my only true revenge .
i died long before you were born .
this ...
is just a formality .
are you ready now ?
more than you know .
goodbye , victoria .
dad ! what the hell are you doing ? ! she was mine !
saving your soul .
you have no idea what crossing that line means .
no matter how justified . it &apos;s over .
no .
what are you doing ?
you devoted your life to saving me . it &apos;s my turn .
i &apos;m not gonna lose you again .
i love you , amanda .
and i love you , too ,
which is why ...
no ! no !
no .
amanda , hold on .
amanda .
ready to go ?
that &apos;s my job , to keep you on schedule today .
i appreciate it .
i &apos;ll just be a minute .
isn &apos;t it beautiful ?
i never thought that ...
i would get to sit here again .
i &apos;m glad the judge agreed to grant you compassionate release .
you deserve this .
this ...
chance to ...
get to know you ,
see ,
the amazing woman that you &apos;ve become ,
has made me feel like my ...
my life is complete .
i can die a happy man .
oh , god .
i &apos;m gonna miss you so much .
whenever you ...
miss me ...
go to that post .
go on .
remember how much i love you .
infinity ...
times ...
infinity .
dad ?
dad ?
upon embarking on a path of revenge ,
confucius warns that one should dig two graves .
confucius was right .
the second of the two graves was meant for me .
i was only saved by my father &apos;s infinite love .
i know now that revenge brings only darkness .
i couldn &apos;t see the light until i considered my father &apos;s advice
to try and forgive .
it &apos;s not easy ,
but my father once said that nothing worth doing ever is .
well , with one exception .
come in !
it &apos;s almost time .
anything i can do ?
yeah . can you help me with this ?
you know , i was ...
i was thinking about that first night at the beach house .
called you out .
yes . i believe i threatened to crush your windpipe .
good times .
oh , that night , i ...
i offered to help you , too ,
and you said i wasn &apos;t a part of this .
clearly , i was wrong .
back then ,
i wasn &apos;t really part of anything .
just .. the awkward billionaire .
no friends , no life .
the time that we spent together ...
gave me purpose .
i was good at it .
now that it &apos;s over , i just ...
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s next .
nolan .
ems .
i &apos;m serious .
is there life after revenge for nolan ross ?
of course there is .
you will find new purpose .
trust me .
let &apos;s get you dressed .
i think you &apos;ve made jack wait long enough . don &apos;t you ?
very funny .
on behalf of amanda and myself ,
i &apos;d like to take a moment to remember
the people we love who couldn &apos;t be with us today ...
my brother declan ,
who always encouraged me
to be the best man that i could be ...
emily thorne ,
to whom we both owe our lives and who brought my ...
my beautiful son carl into this world .
and my father carl senior ,
and our friends aiden and ben .
and finally ...
david ,
who we lost earlier this year .
we miss you all more than words can say .
to david .
you know , it was david who brought
amanda and i together as kids , and ...
reunited us years later
with the passion that he instilled in his daughter .
and it &apos;s his legacy now ...
that sets us off on our first journey
as husband and wife .
amanda and i will be leaving on the boat
that he painstakingly restored for us . and ...
well , we &apos;re just lucky to have you all here with us
to ... to see us off . so ...
thank you .
now that i have all of your attention ,
there &apos;s a little something
that i wanted to give my new husband .
nolan ?
i consider myself lucky .
most morality tales don &apos;t have a happy ending .
for some reason ,
karma saw fit to spare me ,
but not without leaving deeply etched wounds .
is she going to make it ?
time will tell .
what she went through was extremely traumatic ,
but the surgery was a success .
your sister owes you her life .
but she can never know how .
or rather , who .
as you wish .
but it &apos;s extraordinary that they were a match .
amanda &apos;s heart was damaged beyond repair .
if you hadn &apos;t volunteered victoria &apos;s for transplant ...
it &apos;s what mother would &apos;ve wanted .
you had that dream again .
i just can &apos;t get it out of my head .
it &apos;s so real .
well , it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s just a nightmare .
i &apos;ll never be able to put her behind me , will i ?
i love you , jack porter .
i love you , amanda clarke .
when everything you love has been stolen from you ,
consider my story
as you embark on your own journey of revenge .
excuse me , mr. ross ?
amanda clarke said that you could help me .
and always remember ...
that &apos;s my mom .
what goes around , comes around .
she &apos;s innocent .
well played , ems .
well played .
