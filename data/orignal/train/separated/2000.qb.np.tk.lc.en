donna ...
donna .
you know , in all the years that we worked together ,
you &apos;ve been over to my place exactly twice ,
the god @-@ awful dinner party and ...
the other time .
i have been gone three weeks ,
and you &apos;ve been here that many times . what ?
i had a good time at that dinner party .
oh , my god , it is just like you to make a joke .
and ignore the other time .
i brought you your bonus .
really ? you thought that
would make it all better , handing me a check ?
look , i know that you &apos;re pissed .
oh , what gave it away ?
donna ...
you just had to jump in there at the trial , didn &apos;t you ?
you just had to fight my battles for me .
yeah , i did that because , the last time i saw you ,
you were pissed that i didn &apos;t fight for you .
well , congratulations , harvey . all you managed to do
has made it look like i love you .
oh , jesus christ .
oh , my god , you think i do .
i have actually never met such a self @-@ important--
donna , about that time , you once told me--
i don &apos;t care what i once told you !
that wasn &apos;t what louis was asking .
he was asking if i love you .
and you wouldn &apos;t answer .
because he was forcing a yes or no answer
to a complicated question .
i am not in love with you , harvey .
i love you like a brother
or a cousin , somebody that
you really , really look forward to seeing at christmas ,
and then you &apos;re really , really glad to see leave .
and as far as you and i are concerned ,
christmas is over .
i didn &apos;t just come here to give you a check .
i came here to get you back .
what , cameron not working out ?
i heard that little shit redid my entire filing system .
cameron &apos;s fine . look , i need you .
need ?
need .
well , what about jessica ?
already signed off .
how did you get her to do that ?
because i told her i can &apos;t be me without you .
no , you didn &apos;t .
well , i thought it .
and she knows it .
okay , i will come back on two conditions .
one is you replace that check with a bigger one .
and the other ?
harold ...
is that porn ?
no .
well , yes , but that &apos;s not what i &apos;m using it for .
okay , i &apos;m about 150 % sure
that i &apos;m gonna regret this , but ...
what are you using it for ?
i &apos;m looking at tattoos .
i told you , it &apos;s what i &apos;m getting with my first--
bonus time , boys and girls .
too much . way too much .
oof , multiply this by zero , and it &apos;s still way too much .
o &apos;neil , racine ,
sabbatini ... no ross .
very funny , louis .
i &apos;m not kidding .
it looks like you came up empty .
you have the file for the solis motion to dismiss ?
yep , all set . main citations are tabbed .
good . go . i &apos;m busy .
okay , i was just , um ...
you know , before , um ... you--
are you having a stroke ?
what ?
my bonus .
louis didn &apos;t have it .
well , at least , he said that he didn &apos;t have it ,
so i thought that maybe you , uh ...
maybe jessica thinks you don &apos;t deserve one .
you know , because ... you &apos;re not a lawyer .
right , right . no , that &apos;s true , so i guess
these won &apos;t be doing you any good .
jessica thinks you &apos;re not a lawyer .
i don &apos;t think that .
your monica eton performance worked .
you switched carson , gallo , and fogerty .
wait , is that why you &apos;re giving me so much ?
yes . we &apos;re up one .
you might want to hold onto it for a bit .
why ?
hanson .
took a job at the justice department .
our lead is gone . now we &apos;re even .
well , the vote &apos;s in four days .
the tie goes to the incumbent .
so we &apos;re good .
probably .
nice .
uh , you do realize that &quot; hold onto it for a bit &quot; thing ,
that &apos;s just a figure of speech .
yeah , okay , i &apos;m just ... that &apos;s it .
you wanted to see me ?
saw you handing out bonuses to the associates earlier .
they must all be feeling grateful .
the firm was quite generous .
it &apos;s not just the associates who should be rewarded .
well , for me personally , it &apos;s the satisfaction
of the work that drives me .
although the money does help keep score .
you misunderstand me .
i don &apos;t have a check for you , louis .
i was hoping you had one for me .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m confused .
jessica is the one
who handles the bonuses for the partners .
i &apos;m not talking about a bonus check .
i &apos;m talking about a buy @-@ in check for a senior partnership .
as founding partner , i &apos;m entitled to name
one new senior partner a year .
i &apos;m naming you .
you &apos;re making-- you &apos;re--
you &apos;re making me ...
yes .
i can &apos;t wait to tell everybody .
my mother , my father , rabbi shimkoff ...
yes .
oh , my god , the look on harvey &apos;s face !
louis ...
it &apos;s official as of this moment .
but i think we should make the actual announcement
at the next senior partners meeting .
sure , the meeting where
the managing partner will be voted on .
i believe that is on the agenda .
best to do these things face to face , don &apos;t you agree ?
it &apos;s our secret .
tomorrow &apos;s just like any other tuesday .
exactly .
hey , congratulations .
get out .
and take your color @-@ coded filing system with you .
it &apos;s a system . how do i--
i &apos;m trying to give the moment some dramatic flair .
jeez , now he ruined that too .
god .
that &apos;s it ?
that was worth making a whole condition ?
i &apos;ve never fired anyone before .
you know he &apos;s a floating temp , right ?
i mean , he &apos;ll be on somebody else &apos;s desk by the end of lunch .
does everyone have to rain on my parade ?
first of all , you just have to look at the statistics .
i mean , this guy solis could barely crack
20 homers a season a few years ago .
and now he &apos;s banging out over 40 a year ?
what &apos;s that supposed to be , the wisdom of age ?
and you don &apos;t even have to look at what he &apos;s doing on the field
to wonder if this guy is juicing .
just take a look at him .
now , look , i might not be a scientist ,
but i do have common sense ,
and it says this guy is doping .
but hey , that &apos;s just one man &apos;s opinion .
your honor ,
if being an asshole was a criminal offense ,
i &apos;d say lock mr. zielinski up .
in fact , if they want to call him that , be my guest .
but they better use the word &quot; opinion , &quot; like he did .
because unless i woke up this morning in nazi germany ,
that &apos;s my client &apos;s right .
nazi germany ?
making a point .
ja , gut one .
your honor , his client blatantly declares
his rants are merely his opinions
for the sole purpose of skirting libel law .
i drive 65 for the sole purpose
of avoiding a speeding ticket .
doesn &apos;t make me a criminal .
but mr. specter doesn &apos;t have malice against other drivers .
what does he have ?
i don &apos;t know .
your honor , we have a little recording
of mr. zielinski of our own .
this is what mr. zielinski sounds like
when he doesn &apos;t know the cameras are rolling .
solis ? the guy is a goddamn fraud .
he &apos;s juicing , i know it .
i don &apos;t care what evidence he or the league claim to have .
when i say things , people listen ,
and i &apos;m gonna run his ass out of the game .
your honor--
save it , mr. specter .
case goes to trial .
you really only drive 65 ?
in a school zone .
solis doesn &apos;t need the money . what do you want ?
three years &apos; worth of random tests by the league
plus independent tests we had run to quash the rumors .
as you can see , my client is clean .
zielinski doesn &apos;t have these .
oh , he does , and i know it .
because we sent them to him .
but he chooses not to reveal them on his show .
what if i get him to air these results
plus your side of the story ?
too late for that .
we want an apology from your client .
in person ?
nice try .
we want an on @-@ air complete retraction ,
and that &apos;s non @-@ negotiable .
louis .
hi , donna .
i heard you were back .
i am .
yeah , see that .
look , you know , i , um ...
i never-- i never wanted to--
to ... what ?
i never wanted to do what i did .
and i @-@ i just don &apos;t have the words ...
find them .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so , so sorry .
then let us never speak of it again .
mm ... you &apos;re kidding , right ?
did you mean what you just said ?
and more .
then it &apos;s done .
no , it isn &apos;t .
did you hear what i just--
season pass , lincoln center , front row every show .
really ?
yeah .
do i have to go with you ?
hell no .
thank you , louis .
you are welcome .
god , could this day get any better ?
&quot; any better &quot; ?
what was so good about it before ?
huh , what happened ?
something .
nothing , no , can &apos;t i just be glad you &apos;re back ?
you look like you have 80 teeth .
what kind of suit is that ?
brioni . why ?
oh , shit .
welcome back , donna .
thank you , but there &apos;s something i need to tell you .
no need to apologize .
uh , that &apos;s not what it is .
you &apos;re not getting a raise .
daniel just made louis senior partner .
how do you know ?
four years ago , norma told me that louis had a suit
picked out for the day he made senior partner .
he is wearing it .
son of a bitch .
hardman bought another vote .
what are you gonna do about it ?
get it back .
donna ...
yes ?
how &apos;d the suit look ?
dated .
thank you .
can &apos;t believe that asshole put us in this pickle .
i &apos;d think you &apos;d admire him .
he &apos;s cleaning up the game you love .
he &apos;s been throwing accusations around with no proof ,
and i &apos;ve had about enough of that lately .
well , proof or no proof , anybody can see
that solis is juicing .
that &apos;s not what those tests say .
people can find ways to pass tests , trust me .
michael !
grammy ? rachel . oh , no .
um , harvey ...
this is your famous grandmother ?
oh , you were right . he is sharp .
what are you doing here ?
mr. specter , pleasure to meet you .
your grandson says nice things about you .
oh , he tells me you &apos;re quite the hardass .
can be a hardass .
&quot; hardass &quot; isn &apos;t really the word he uses .
okay , grammy .
i see lip runs in the family .
it &apos;s nice meeting you .
yeah , um ... what are you doing here ?
and--and--and why are you in rachel &apos;s office ?
oh , we bumped into each other downstairs in the lobby .
i thought we could eat .
might as well have brought it to me a star wars lunchbox .
don &apos;t give me lip , michael . it &apos;s been two months .
i thought maybe you &apos;d want to see i &apos;m still alive .
she &apos;s got a point , michael .
plus i wanted to meet the people you work with .
like rachel .
she &apos;s even more lovely than you said .
&quot; lovely &quot; ?
okay , we &apos;re done here .
bye , dear .
i hope to see you again soon .
me too .
it was lovely to meet you .
okay , did you really have to tell rachel that i said she was hot ?
oh , fine , just let me meet that harold clown ,
and i &apos;ll go .
you planned this whole thing from the beginning , didn &apos;t you ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you got hanson that job at justice .
it was a loss for us ,
but a gain for justice , don &apos;t you think ?
and making louis litt a senior partner behind my back .
is that all part of the new daniel hardman
era of transparency ?
it &apos;s within my rights
according to the bylaws you wrote .
ah , yes ,
and how much did buying his vote cost you ?
cost me ?
it was earned years ago .
and your failure to promote him is a perfect example
of how your judgment has harmed this firm .
my judgment and my discretion
are the only reasons your ass didn &apos;t end up
in jail five years ago .
it wasn &apos;t discretion , it was self @-@ interest .
you ousted me and got the firm .
i saved you and got the firm .
you did .
but you didn &apos;t steal the ball from me five years ago .
i dropped it .
my lieutenant was all you were ever meant to be .
i &apos;m going to offer you a deal .
take porter , feldman , gallagher ...
i &apos;ll let you walk away , set up shop wherever you like .
i &apos;ll waive the non @-@ compete .
you don &apos;t have the votes .
i put you out once .
when i beat you this time ,
they &apos;re gonna have to peel you off the wall .
it &apos;s nice to see you
doing your own dirty work for a change .
unfortunately , this time , you can &apos;t have harvey threaten
to tell my dying wife or my teenage daughter
about my indiscretions .
you didn &apos;t even know about sarah , did you ?
he did what i told him to do .
no .
you can &apos;t even control your own attack dog .
well , get this .
i wasn &apos;t even planning on coming back after alicia died .
then you sent him , and i had no choice .
bullshit .
you do what you want to do .
you always have , and you always will .
well , water under the bridge .
we are where we are .
and i like where i am .
and we &apos;ll see who peels whom off the wall .
let me get this straight .
you realized that daniel was pulling a move ,
and you confronted him ?
how many times have you told me not to poke the bear ?
i didn &apos;t just poke .
i made him an offer .
which he refused .
and now he knows we &apos;re on to louis .
if i lose this thing because of louis litt ...
you &apos;re not losing .
you have a card to play that hardman doesn &apos;t have .
no , no
yes .
partner bonuses haven &apos;t gone out yet .
i &apos;m not using the bonuses to buy people off .
you might be ethically against playing politics
with our firm &apos;s money , but he isn &apos;t .
this isn &apos;t about ethics .
if i give louis an extra $ 100,000,
how &apos;s that gonna play with gallo , klyman , reeger ?
then do what daniel did . make another senior partner .
we get one each per year . i named you .
read the bylaws , will you ?
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
louis is going to be the deciding vote .
and he better vote for me .
no , no !
yes .
harvey , this is your chance to prove
you learned something from that mess
you made with paul porter .
i have nothing to offer him .
harvey , you &apos;ve treated that man like shit at every turn .
you are the thorn in his side .
it is time that you pull that thorn out .
here are your interrogatories .
thank you .
oh , and remember , michael ,
you have to finish your homework before you can watch tv .
oh , right , because my grandmother brought me lunch ,
that makes me ...
a little boy .
and this is really fun for you .
it really kind of is .
are you thinking about moving ?
uh , no , actually i was looking into getting
a place in manhattan for my lunch lady .
you &apos;d really do that for her ?
i am doing it .
it doesn &apos;t even come close to paying her back
for everything she &apos;s done for me .
that &apos;s , um ...
that &apos;s really amazing , mike .
you wanna know what &apos;s amazing ?
what ?
this place .
right here , check it out .
it &apos;s pretty sweet , right ?
off 10th avenue .
does it come with a bulletproof vest ?
um ... okay .
there , how about this one ?
a six floor walk @-@ up .
great views .
move over .
okay .
wait a minute .
yeah ?
you set all this up , so i &apos;d help , didn &apos;t you ?
oh , i may be a little boy ,
but i &apos;m not a stupid little boy .
you &apos;re a sneaky little boy .
show me how it goes .
partner , senior partner . it all sounds the same to me .
no , mom , how many times do i have to tell you ?
senior partner is the inner circle .
it just makes you sound like an old man .
stop it .
and what would you know about it , dad ?
well , you are losing your hair .
it &apos;s the cut .
it is not the cut .
it &apos;s the cut !
and by the way , dad , if you &apos;re not going to bother
to figure out where the camera is ,
maybe you should put some freaking pants on .
i know where the camera is .
i &apos;m not ashamed of my body .
if you felt the same way , maybe there &apos;d be a mrs. litt .
louie , i don &apos;t want to die before i see my grandchildren .
mom , you have two grandchildren .
esther &apos;s children are not litts !
is that your mom and dad on there ?
get out , harvey , i &apos;m skyping .
is that harvey specter ? let me speak to him .
it is about time i met your best fri ...
was that your mom and dad ?
what &apos;s up ? no .
what &apos;s this ?
the address of my tailor . donna said you asked for it .
and what would really happen to me if i show up at that address ?
you get a nice suit , one that you could wear tonight
when i take you out to dinner .
donna .
what &apos;s the fun of being senior partner
if you have to keep it a secret ?
and why exactly should i dine with you ?
because you &apos;ve been waiting a long time for this ,
and i want to congratulate you .
you want to congratulate me on becoming your peer .
yes .
say it .
i &apos;m your peer .
you &apos;re my peer .
we &apos;re exactly the same .
we &apos;re exactly the same .
if two girls saw us walking down the street ,
they &apos;d say , &quot; hey , those guys are twins .
identical .
okay , i &apos;m cancelling .
okay , no , i &apos;m in . i &apos;m in .
i &apos;m in . what time ?
7 : 30 .
are you gonna be there at 7 : 30 ?
ok , eight .
donna tells the woman , &quot; i don &apos;t care who you are ,
you &apos;re not getting my grapefruit . &quot;
then what did you do ?
what could i do ?
i gave her my grapefruit .
thank you . this is great , harvey .
we &apos;re like two fingers on the same hand .
as long as i &apos;m the index .
i &apos;m serious , this is nice , you know ?
colleagues . equals .
friends .
well , as a friend ,
i want you to see something .
what do you got ?
five years ago , i asked you for help
to look into another firm &apos;s books .
well , they were our books .
i helped you prove hardman was embezzling .
you also tried to set up a fall guy .
me .
&quot; a schmuck , &quot; i believe , was the term you used at the time .
this was five years ago ,
and you &apos;re just getting around to telling me now ?
i wonder why that is .
i didn &apos;t see the need for you to be hurt .
right , &apos; cause i &apos;m your friend .
a friend tells you the truth ,
and the truth is , hardman used you to hide his embezzling ,
and he &apos;s using you again .
and how exactly is that different from
what you &apos;re doing right now ?
you can &apos;t trust him .
but i can trust you ?
yes , you can .
oh , please .
did i tell jessica about your little dictaphone maneuver ?
no , you know what you did ?
you lorded it over my head ,
said that i &apos;d owe you , and now you &apos;ve come to collect .
well , you know what ? go ahead .
run to mommy . tattle .
i mean , this was about my vote ?
if i do vote for daniel ,
what is jessica gonna do about it ?
i found this one that faces away from lex ,
so she won &apos;t get all the street noise ,
and i checked into the doormen .
raul &apos;s been here 14 years , and jimbo 17 .
jimbo ?
people open up to me .
so what do you think ?
i think ...
grammy &apos;s gonna love it when i tell her
she has a new place to live tonight .
come on , you haven &apos;t even seen the bedroom yet .
holy shit .
i know .
it &apos;s perfect , right ?
all you need are some new curtains right here .
no , the first thing i would do is put down a nice rug .
you wanna cover the hardwood ?
not all of it .
so you mean an area rug .
no , i mean , cover an area of the hardwood with a rug .
i can live with that . like an 8x10 sisal .
a whatsal ?
the beige , scratchy kind .
a scratchy rug defeats its own purpose .
it wasn &apos;t my idea in the first place .
fair enough , but the bed--
the bed goes here .
oh , my god , you &apos;re such a guy .
if the bed doesn &apos;t go here ,
then what &apos;s the point of even having the window ?
yeah , but your curtains cover up the light anyway .
no , that would be shades ,
which this room will never , ever have .
look , just come right here .
see what i mean ?
beautiful .
i should go meet harvey .
it &apos;s really hot in here .
yeah .
nice of you to make it .
sorry , i had this thing with rachel .
oh , a date . isn &apos;t that special ?
not as special as your date last night .
so how is louis ? what did he wear ?
did you get any ?
shut me down .
what ?
this is serious . what are we gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know , but i &apos;ll tell you one thing--
i &apos;m not taking no for an answer .
no way ! you want me to apologize on the air ?
why don &apos;t i just drop my pants
and paint a clown on my ass ?
save that for sweeps .
i have a reputation , mr. specter .
and by the way , i don &apos;t appreciate you bashing it in court .
look , i went to court to win the case ,
not protect your reputation .
yeah , well , turns out you didn &apos;t do either one .
here &apos;s a suggestion .
next time , make sure you &apos;re actually off the air
before shooting your mouth off .
i stand by what i said .
solis is doping .
曾保持赛季最多全垒打纪录达37年
roger maris got an asterisk next to his name .
this guy deserves an asterisk next to his name ,
and i want him out of the league .
you &apos;re not the commissioner of baseball .
yeah , well , the commissioner could never get my ratings .
mr. zielinski--
see , finally ,
someone who treats me with respect .
we can &apos;t claim
that you &apos;re just offering up opinions anymore .
if you don &apos;t apologize , we have to show
that you have a factual basis for accusing solis of doping .
of course i did .
then give us your source .
what kind of career do you think
i &apos;d have if i give that up ?
i &apos;ll tell you what-- nonexistent .
exactly like your source .
harvey , please , could--
that &apos;s it .
instead of bugging me to give up my guy
after i already told you no ,
why don &apos;t you do your damn job and win this case ?
well , looks like good cop , bad cop didn &apos;t work .
actually it did ... on me .
what are you talking about ?
if he &apos;s full of shit and has no source ,
he knows this eventually goes against him in court .
i think solis is doping .
welcome to the party .
and zielinski may have some integrity .
i thought you said he was a dick .
if he &apos;s actually protecting his source ,
he &apos;s a dick with a code .
his code is our problem .
if we can &apos;t find that source , we can &apos;t fix it .
forget the source .
we need to figure out how solis passed those tests .
how are we supposed to do that ?
not us , you .
i &apos;m like zielinski , you &apos;re like solis .
an all @-@ star .
a cheater .
you &apos;re not gonna tell the bar association
that i deserve an asterisk , are you ?
you just gave me a good idea .
i hope it doesn &apos;t involve you telling the bar association
that i deserve an asterisk .
oh , a bat .
what , are you gonna hit me if i don &apos;t vote for jessica ?
no , i just wanted you to hear a story before you decided .
more dirt on hardman .
the story &apos;s about roger maris .
yeah , what , did he work for hardman ?
he used to play for the yankees .
he beat babe ruth &apos;s home run record
with this bat .
you brought a prop . that &apos;s really cute .
maris did it in a longer season ,
so no one really gave him credit for it ,
and it went down in people &apos;s minds with an asterisk .
i see , so it &apos;s a parable . how literary of you .
becoming senior partner is your life &apos;s work , louis .
you really want to buy it with your vote ?
daniel did not condition my partnership on anything .
maybe , but it &apos;ll always have an asterisk .
you know what ? it &apos;s like you just can &apos;t fathom
that i actually earned it .
whether you earned it or not , that &apos;s not the point .
it &apos;s everything .
all i am saying is , you vote for hardman ,
everyone will see this as quid pro quo .
yeah , because you &apos;re gonna tell them .
no , i won &apos;t tell them .
they &apos;ll wonder about it all on their own ,
just like you will .
do me a favor right now ...
take your bat and go .
go .
louis ...
you were right at dinner .
i was using you , and i was wrong .
but this decision ,
it isn &apos;t about me .
you came up under hardman . you hated him .
you always hated him .
don &apos;t let him do this to you .
what &apos;s my alternative , harvey ?
jessica didn &apos;t even have the courtesy
to court my vote herself .
so she sends you . well , guess what .
you failed .
so go back right now . you tell her ,
harvey specter , the great closer ,
couldn &apos;t close me .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be off accepting the award
for world &apos;s best grandson ?
uh , i had to cancel .
weren &apos;t you taking her to dinner
to tell her about the apartment you bought for her
to make up for the fact that
you don &apos;t have time to take her to dinner anymore ?
for your information ,
she was happy when i called to reschedule .
happy to be stood up .
happy that i have a job that fully engages me .
there was a time she was worried that wouldn &apos;t happen .
despite harvard law school ?
no , i mean , when i was younger .
she &apos;s right that you &apos;re really lucky
you get to do something that challenges you .
i hope i have that someday .
rachel , i told you , whenever you want help with--
holy sh-- , you took the lsa--
you took the lsats ?
i did .
how did you do ?
um ... i don &apos;t know .
rachel , you already did the hard part .
you took the test . opening the envelope is easy .
no , every other time i &apos;ve had to open the envelope--
this isn &apos;t every other time .
do you want me to open it ?
no .
yes , you do .
okay , um , if i score below 160,
then i just want you to throw it away .
and don &apos;t tell me . i don &apos;t want to know , okay ?
okay .
okay .
um ... rachel , i &apos;m ...
okay .
172 .
172 ?
you got a 172 .
oh , my--i did ?
yes .
that &apos;s--oh , oh , my god !
oh , my god , don &apos;t you ever do that to me again .
rachel , you &apos;re gonna be a lawyer .
look , look at it .
oh , my god .
go .
bam .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m gonna be out of a job .
harvey , i think i found something .
and by &quot; something , &quot; i assume you mean
how solis was cheating .
um , maybe ,
but i definitely figured out who zielinski &apos;s source is .
well , that counts as something .
they used a hot mic , i used a hot mic .
what are you talking about ?
i found some footage from a segment
that zielinski taped at spring training .
uh , the crew is setting up , he &apos;s in the background ,
having a very intense conversation with ruben hernandez .
mediocre catcher .
so ? zielinski &apos;s a sportscaster .
talking to athletes is what he does all day .
this conversation took place in winter park .
hernandez should have been practicing with his team in ...
st. pete .
he never should have been there .
then i remembered the roster of
every single team solis ever played on .
they never played together .
wrong , they did .
ten games , three years ago ,
hernandez &apos;s rookie year .
so he got hernandez to take the test for him .
or at least approached him .
because zielinski &apos;s accusations began
one week after that tape that i watched .
enough time for zielinski to look into whatever hernandez told him .
and call him six times from a company @-@ issued cell phone .
boom !
look at you ! hot mic , using their tricks against them .
yeah , it &apos;s what we do , no big deal .
remind me to stop teaching you my tricks .
well , you &apos;re gonna need one of your tricks .
because what good does zielinski &apos;s source do us
if he &apos;s not going to let us go public ?
who says we have to go public ?
here &apos;s what i need you to do .
i couldn &apos;t close him .
are you trying to tell me
you couldn &apos;t be nice to louis even for this ?
no , i &apos;m not .
you said i &apos;m a thorn in his side .
i tried to take it out , but you &apos;re the one
who &apos;s had what he &apos;s wanted all these years
and didn &apos;t give it to him .
senior partnership .
you need to tell him he deserves it .
that &apos;s what i sent you to do .
he needs to hear it from you .
you know , i send you to do this one thing and you can &apos;t--
fine , i &apos;ll talk to him .
wait a minute .
you know him . you knew this .
this is where it always ended up .
you got me .
why send me first ?
because if louis didn &apos;t have to work to get me there ,
he wouldn &apos;t believe me when i went .
you &apos;re playing chess
while everybody else is playing checkers .
are you just getting that ,
mr. i &apos;m @-@ the @-@ best @-@ closer- this @-@ city &apos;s @-@ ever @-@ seen ?
hey , you &apos;re the one who always calls me that .
well , maybe i shouldn &apos;t .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have to tell louis he deserves to be senior partner .
you know what , i am the best closer this city &apos;s ever seen ,
and i didn &apos;t even make a dent .
do you have a point ?
he needs more than just words .
i told you , i &apos;m not bribing him .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
his anger is deep .
he wants us to feel pain .
how ?
give him my office .
you &apos;re willing to do that ?
remember when you questioned
if i could put your needs above mine ?
here &apos;s your answer .
mr. solis , big fan .
can i get an autograph ?
sure , buddy .
can you just sign it &quot; roberto solis , steroid user &quot; ?
what ?
i represent tony zielinski .
you can &apos;t talk to me without my lawyer .
ah , you &apos;re right , i can &apos;t .
you go ahead and turn me in . when you do ,
i &apos;ll tell them all about zielinski &apos;s source
inside your clubhouse .
bullshit .
baseball is a brotherhood .
nobody on my team would go public against me .
but ruben hernandez isn &apos;t on your team anymore .
if ruben tries ratting out a former teammate ,
no ball club in this league will forgive him .
he might not have a choice when we subpoena him .
no , no way .
if zielinski &apos;s giving up ruben , he &apos;d have done it already .
he might not , but i will .
you &apos;re in a rundown , roberto .
drop the suit and announce your retirement from baseball .
are you out of your mind ?
you do it ,
zielinski will never mention your name on air again .
you don &apos;t , hernandez outs you ,
and the whole world knows who you are .
louis , got a minute ?
i &apos;m a little busy , but sure .
i deserve that .
a little payback among senior partners is fair play .
i &apos;m listening .
i &apos;m not going to insult you by beating around the bush ,
so let &apos;s talk about the elephant in the room .
what &apos;s it gonna take ?
my dedication to this firm knows no limits .
and what i ask in return-- all i ask in return--
is to be valued ,
for someone to make me believe that
they think that i &apos;m great at what i do .
then we &apos;re all set .
because i &apos;ve always felt that way .
that &apos;s not the way you made it seem
to everyone at harvey &apos;s trial .
louis , we were at trial .
i was trying to make my case , same as you .
well , you did a good job .
because that jessica , i got no trouble believing .
but the jessica that kept stringing me along ,
telling me , one day , my time would come--
her , i &apos;ve come to doubt .
i &apos;ve always been straight with you , louis .
my message has never wavered .
does that include the message
that you sent to me through harvey ?
harvey came to you first
because i wanted you to know
that you are valuable to both of us .
no , there &apos;s only an &quot; us &quot;
when you want something from me .
the rest of the time , it &apos;s me on the outside , looking in .
well , you &apos;re a senior partner now .
you &apos;re as on the inside as it gets .
that &apos;s right , thanks to hardman .
you think he &apos;s valuing you .
he &apos;s buying you ...
with this one thing at this convenient time .
you don &apos;t get it . hardman actually sees me .
with you , i &apos;ll always be this mushroom
in the shadow of harvey &apos;s tree .
what are you saying , louis ?
i &apos;m saying it &apos;s time you put harvey in my shadow .
and how exactly would you like me to do that ?
you know , i don &apos;t know . you figure it out .
otherwise , maybe one of these days ,
you &apos;ll see what it &apos;s like to be
in someone &apos;s shadow for a while .
you know what , louis ?
harvey told me that i should give you his office .
and i came in here prepared to do just that .
but i don &apos;t respond to threats ,
and i &apos;m not going to buy your vote
because that &apos;s not who i am .
but know this :
i will win .
and tomorrow , after the vote ,
if you are on the wrong side ,
there &apos;ll be no coming back .
when you stole from this firm ,
did you do anything to cover your tracks ?
i should have known they had this in their pocket .
so you don &apos;t deny it .
i wouldn &apos;t insult your intelligence .
i &apos;m sure they came to you armed with proof ,
and you followed the numbers better than i ever could .
why ?
the best i can offer you
is that it wasn &apos;t personal .
it was just that , given your financial expertise ,
i thought you would seem plausible .
&quot; plausible . &quot;
obviously my plan was that
nobody would notice the money was missing in the first place .
so i was plan &quot; b. &quot;
i suppose so , louis .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re sor--
do you realize you could have destroyed my entire career ?
maybe even sent me to prison .
and you know what ?
i didn &apos;t care .
that &apos;s the truth .
and you want me to vote for you ?
did you like me back then ?
i didn &apos;t .
the man i was five years ago shouldn &apos;t be managing partner .
he shouldn &apos;t even work here .
but i &apos;m not that man .
if you think otherwise , don &apos;t vote for me .
right .
and if i don &apos;t support you ,
what happens to my senior partnership ?
do you think my making you senior partner
is conditioned on my having your vote ?
wasn &apos;t it ?
louis , i &apos;m disappointed .
i &apos;m disappointed you think so little of yourself .
i saw the way you dominated jessica at harvey &apos;s trial
and lost because of some trick .
you thought i dominated ?
i offered you what i thought you deserved .
no more , no less .
i ask for nothing in return
but that you vote your conscience .
louis ...
don &apos;t doubt yourself .
i &apos;ve got good news .
solis has not only agreed to drop the suit ,
but to retire from the game as well .
well , maybe you &apos;re not the asshole i thought you were .
i &apos;m not done yet .
in return ...
you &apos;re never gonna talk about him again on the air .
so he walks away with his reputation intact ?
that &apos;s the deal .
no , no , no , no .
you know i &apos;m right ,
and you want me to step off the gas
right when i got him ? screw that .
you want to know how i know you &apos;re right ?
mike ?
i believe you know ruben hernandez .
you promised you wouldn &apos;t tell anyone i was your source .
i didn &apos;t tell them . i didn &apos;t .
bullshit !
mike , get him out of here .
i promise we &apos;ll fix this . come on .
you son of a bitch ! you &apos;re supposed to be on my side .
this is me being on your side .
you make me win this in court ,
i &apos;ll have to do it by making ruben testify .
so the cost of ruining solis &apos; reputation
will be that kid &apos;s career .
and by the way , everyone will think the same as he does .
you gave him up to save your own ass .
that &apos;s a lie .
doesn &apos;t matter .
they &apos;ll think it anyway .
but hey , that &apos;s just one man &apos;s opinion .
you want to protect your source ?
take the deal .
so ?
he took the deal .
we &apos;re done with that asshole .
&quot; asshole &quot; ?
come on , he &apos;s just protecting the church of baseball .
you going bull durham on me ?
oh , yeah , yeah , i &apos;m tim robbins ,
the hotshot pitcher who &apos;s destined for the majors ,
and you &apos;re that old man who never really made it there .
you know robbins wore
women &apos;s underwear in that movie , right ?
yeah , after he slept with susan sarandon .
good one .
but if you ever call kevin costner an old man again ,
you won &apos;t get another bonus .
okay .
whoa , my god , bonus .
harvey , i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;ve got to go see my grandmother .
fine , go , i wouldn &apos;t want her to think i was a hardass .
did you get rid of that libel case ?
score one for free press .
good to see you back in stride .
when was i ever off ?
jessica , do you have a moment ?
of course , louis . harvey , will you give us a sec ?
oh , please , what , are you kidding ?
not like there &apos;s any secrets between you two .
well , we &apos;re listening .
i &apos;m presenting my partnership buy @-@ in check
to you in your current capacity as managing partner .
&quot; current . &quot;
oh , is that your cryptic way of asking about my vote ?
you kept me waiting five years .
you can wait another 24 hours .
surprise !
rachel ... hey , what are you doing here ?
come in .
mike , someone kept calling the office for you .
it was the nursing home and ...
i guess--i guess that &apos;s the emergency number they had .
um ... what ?
it &apos;s your grandma .
she passed away .
no . no , she &apos;s--
i am so sorry .
but ...
she didn &apos;t even get to ... to see ...
i know .
i @-@ i &apos;m--
i &apos;m so sorry .
