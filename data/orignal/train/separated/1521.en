Okay, Gloria, just make sure Jay doesn't find out.
Oh. Boy.
I just heard that.
You probably think there's something between me and Gloria.
Relax.
I couldn't be more relaxed if I was in a coma.
Jay's grill was delivered.
She's keeping it under wraps
so I can be there when he sees it!
Oh, my God!
I just got accepted into Caltech.
You did?!
That is incredible!
We're gonna have a famous scientist in the family!
Uh, not that there's any shame in learning a trade.
Air conditioners are always gonna break.
Eh, I looked into it. It's a lot of classes.
Honey, that is unbelievable.
It's hardly unbelievable.
Super-smart kid, super-smart school.
I never doubted you.
That must feel great.
Yep. Pretty great.
What was that?
I think that was my fault.
Me too. Why?
I do this all the time.
She does these amazing things, and I'm so used to it,
I don't even make a big deal over Caltech.
I got excited. Doesn't that count?
Well, honey, you get excited over everything.
You're a born cheerleader.
I just need to make a really big fuss over Alex today.
That's all.
I know -- you're upset
because I said that you were a born --
There's no such thing as a born cheerleader.
It takes hard work and sacrifice.
You know what a human pyramid
is without hours of training?
10 obituaries.
I think my dad is really gonna enjoy returning his gift this year.
Mitchell, I have some really sad news.
Yes, you seem very broken up.
Apparently, I had an uncle, uh, Cyrus,
who died and out of the blue
left me a pretty handsome sum.
I-I guess he didn't have a lot of other kin.
Okay, this is the one time I don't mind you saying "Kin."
Now, when you say "handsome,"
are we talking carpool dad at Lily's school
or are we in a more Clooney/Pitt area?
I would say more Harry Hamlin.
That's not bad at --
That's not bad at all.
You know, and this is crazy, because, um, I just saw
that the upstairs unit went back on the market,
and Harry Hamlin would almost equal a down payment, and --
I'm -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Look at me, spending your money.
No, Mitchell, it's not my money.
It's our money.
I-is this a sign, Cam?
I mean, we talk about it all the time.
We should buy that upstairs apartment.
I don't see a reason why not!
This is so exciting.
I know.
I'm really proud of you,
because there was a time
when I wouldn't have even seen this check.
Oh, well, yes.
You know, I used to be quite the impulse buyer.
But I don't even recognize that guy anymore.
I love my new faux mink, daddy.
I forgot -- which Gabor sister am I?
Y-you're Eva, the classy one, but listen.
We need to keep the tags on it, because it's going back.
Well, then yours is going back, too.
No, that's a hard thing,
because the saleslady said I look like Dr. Zhivago.
So, is that a birthday present for you
or an extremely late mid-life crisis?
I don't think "extremely" is necessary.
It's on loan -- kind of a weekend-long test-drive.
I walk into a store,
they make me leave my backpack behind the counter.
It's an old car salesman's trick.
They're hoping I fall in love with it and never give it back.
But I can't justify buying it
any more than you can justify that hat.
Little early for tequila, isn't it?
It's for Luke.
Not sure that's better.
The last time he was here,
he was eyeing this bottle the same way you look at me
when I wear that strappy sundress.
I do like that dress.
I am going to catch him red-handed.
I am going to teach him a lesson.
But first I'm going to refill this with water
in case he gets past me.
You know, we have a little time before the family comes.
Why don't you throw that dress on and --
Aw, damn it.
Andy, can you get that?
Andy?
Sorry.
I tuned out when you started flirting
to give you some privacy.
I was seeing Haley for the first time
since she came to visit me in the hospital.
She said some pretty heavy stuff.
If I'm your elephant,
you have a shot.
That's what I'm trying to say, dummy.
She didn't know I heard.
I tried for a couple weeks to forget about it
and just go on with Beth,
but I couldn't stop thinking about Haley.
So... today's the day I'm finally gonna have the big talk.
There's a cooler of drinks out back! Help yourselves!
Where's Haley? Is she coming?
The last time Haley informed me of her plans, she said,
"Ha ha. I'm going to Cabo, and you're not."
She's the best.
Get ready to see the best gift ever.
Happy birthday!
It's a grill. I got a grill.
You had a wife, too.
Didn't mean you couldn't trade up.
I give you the Flame XL.
My client owns the company.
He gave me a crazy-good deal.
25,000 wood propane BTUs.
That's... plenty, right?
No. Electric rotisserie!
If god wants a hamburger,
this is what she cooks it on.
But it's got all those doodads.
I don't know what to do with those doodads.
You're doing a great job
of hiding your excitement about this gift.
Look. It's simplicity itself.
You just turn on the gas, hit the electric starter.
Hit the electric starter.
Phil, you might want to lay off --
I'm fine.
Healthy as ever.
I'd know if you weren't, 'cause I just saw your skeleton.
Okay, Joe.
Time for a nap in your new bed!
Looking for something?
Uh, yeah -- you.
I just wanted to say what a nice party you put together.
The secret is to know what your guests want,
and I know what you want.
Hey, Luke, quick lesson.
This is a coaster. It prevents rings.
Thanks to you and your Dr pepper,
my teak end table upstairs looks like the olympic flag.
Think, Luke.
Yes. Think, Luke.
Did you get it?
Yep.
Sweet Mexican treasure.
I was born in Florida, but thank you.
So, you really think you're gonna buy it?
I mean, it makes sense.
We're kind of cramped where we are.
There she is -- our little genius.
She just got accepted to Caltech.
Oh, that's amazing!
It's not that big of a deal.
It's a huge deal!
That school pumps out Nobel prize winners
the way my school pumped out stomachs.
Enough, mom!
what was that about?
I didn't make a big enough fuss
about her getting into Caltech,
and now she's making me pay.
Well, if that's her giving you a hard time,
I think you got off pretty easy.
Well, that's true.
That one never really went through a rebellious phase.
Remember how wild we were?
Were we ever!
Were we ever?
Not really, no.
You had your summer of the red afro,
and I dated the whitest Puerto Rican on earth.
Oh, Wayne.
Hey, but it's not like we didn't separate
and strike out on our own.
Am I right?
Yeah! That's right.
Dad bought me my house.
Ours, too.
He loaned us the money for the down payment.
We never paid him back.
I've always felt so guilty.
You know, he gave us our down payment, too.
Are you sure that wasn't a gift?
Well, I never offered to pay him back. I don't know.
And then he just gave me this bonus at work.
What he must think of me.
It's so long ago now.
Well, still.
I feel like I should offer to pay him back.
What -- no. N-no. No, no, no, no, no, no, Claire.
Because then I'm gonna have to pay him back,
and I'll be stuck in the same shoe box
he bought me last time.
Mitchell, he's not going to accept it.
It's just a gesture.
We do it so we feel more independent.
Just do it.
Do it!
Do what?
Oh, nothing. You're busy.
Not really.
Phil's tinkering with the new grill,
so you better collect some old photographs for the memorial.
Do what?
Well, you probably don't remember this.
But, a while back,
you gave us some money for a down payment.
Very generously, I might add. Yes.
And not just cause it's your birthday...
That's right.
...but we wanted to at least make the offer
to pay...you...back.
Mitchell, what are you doing? I can't cash this.
Now, dad, I--
You got to sign it first.
Okay, in that case,
I'm gonna need to get the pen back from--
Claire!
Got one right here.
Okay.
Hey, you.
I didn't expect to see you here today.
How you feeling?
Better. Turns out you don't even need an appendix.
I don't even miss it anymore.
It's like Circuit City.
Anyway, I've been wanting to talk to you about something.
This house is fantastic.
I should have gone into the closet business.
Right?
I'm giving him a tour. Andy, this is Will.
Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry. I have to take this.
It's the hospital.
He's a doctor.
I met him the same day I came to visit you in the hospital.
Isn't that funny?
Super-funny.
So, wait. What did you want to talk to me about?
Just that this little heck-raiser
needs to take a nap, but he's been fighting it.
Oh, I've got an idea. Luke had the same problem.
I'm tired.
Let's go to bed.
Both of us?
Together? Me too?
Yes, because we are sleepy and it's nap time!
Now wait. He'll climb in bed with us.
Just give him a minute.
Okay.
Since we're just lying here...
do you remember when you --
Sorry about that.
Oh! Gosh!
Oh, Gosh.
You're gone for two minutes,
you come back and find us in the big-boy bed.
I can only imagine what you're thinking.
That you're trying to get this little kid to take a nap?
How smart is he?
Say something medical.
20cc, stat.
I don't understand a word, but it gets me going.
I mean, what kind of store policy is that?
I-I can't return a coat
that I put on one time at home?
Getting out of the shower.
Yeah, you didn't help by pointing that out.
What are you gonna tell daddy?
Well, I guess I'm just gonna tell him I made a mistake.
You know, like I say, sweetie,
honesty is always the best policy.
Unless...
and stay with me here...
Where would I go?
I convince your daddy to wait on the apartment upstairs
until I have enough time to sell your coat,
and, if need be, even sell mine.
Thanks for selling mine first, Dr. Chicago.
If I'm reading this properly,
I'm supposed to put a lime in your mouth,
salt on your stomach,
and drink it out of your bellybutton.
You wish.
That'll get you there.
Whoa, nelly.
Hey, pace yourself! This stuff is strong.
I'll know when I've had enough.
I got it lit.
I could feel it inside the house.
They're gonna need dental records
to identify those chickens.
You'll be singing a different tune
once I pop on the rotisserie feature.
Get ready for these birds and your head to spin.
That's moving pretty fast.
Simple adjustment.
That seems to have... sped it up.
H-how about you skim dinner out of my pool?
I'll get my old grill out.
Why is this even a setting?!
Hey, where the hell did you go, you coward?
Oh, what, just cause dad took your money back,
I'm supposed to give him all mine, too?
Yes, yes. Because it was your stupid idea. Okay?
Oh, my god. How am I gonna tell Cam
I gave away his entire inheritance?
I don't know.
Oh, hey! Is there a future doctor in the house?
Yeah, I think he's upstairs, feeling up Haley.
No -- you, Alex Einstein.
Whatever you're doing, please stop.
She's still mad.
Yeah, so am I.
It's not fair, okay?
Dad gave you the same amount of money for your down payment.
What? Jay loaned us that money?
Oh, my god. You don't know. Yes. Yes.
Makes you wonder what else she's lied about, huh?
Wait -- I've owed jay money for 20 years,
and you never told me?
I didn't think you'd want to take it.
I finally understand the invisible wall
that's been between jay and me all this time.
This is why we're not laughing about that crazy grill,
taking an awesome selfie with it,
posting it on Instagram,
sending hilarious e-mails back and forth!
"Remember when the grill went nuts?"
"Oh, yeah. That was hilarious."
"You're hilarious."
So what, he's a doctor?
I could be a doctor.
I still have the white coat
from when I worked at the clinique counter.
Hey. So, Gloria says it's Joe's bath time.
He just had one.
What's with the robe, Hef?
I don't know who that is, but I took off my shirt
to protect it from splash Gordon over here.
Adorbs.
Can you grab me that juice box?
Yeah, sure.
Anyway...
Like I was saying before,
Remember how, when I was in the hospital --
Oh, no!
Oh, man, this is gonna stain!
I need to take it off and soak it.
You could put on my shirt. It's hanging right there.
Oh, thanks.
It's a little boxy. Do you have a chunky belt?
Uh...yeah, I guess.
I'm kidding.
It's not like I'm gonna be wearing this for long anyways.
Wow. This looks bad.
And this looks even worse.
But there's a perfectly good explanation.
Hey, babe. You spill something on your dress?
Really? That was your first guess?
Yeah, I was giving Andy a juice box.
Mm. Not to drink -- because I'm a man.
Okay, so, I'm gonna go get a dress
and some shoes from Gloria's closet.
What happened to your shoes?
Nothing.
Okay.
I've been watching the two of you,
and it's pretty obvious.
Finally.
You know how to make her laugh.
Anyway, I got haley a little gift,
and I want to write something cute on the card.
I thought you could help me, because --
Because you're not good with words.
Well, I'm a doctor.
I can't admit I'm not good at something.
But...please?
Yeah. Fine.
Just... write how you feel.
Something like...
"Dear Haley, I know how eyes work,
But I never knew how they sparkled until I --"
That could be macular degeneration.
Just write.
We need to sober up.
Right after I call an ex-girlfriend.
I think I still love her.
Hey. Sorry we're late.
No, that's fine. No worries.
Um, so, listen, my stupid sister --
Look, I don't want that apartment anymore.
Oh, me neither.
Yeah, it's just that --
Well, I thought you had your heart set on it.
I did, but then you made such a compelling case.
Hey, Mitch, I got to tell you, I was really impressed
with you paying back that loan.
I'm sorry. What? Excuse me?
I'm sorry. I should be thanking you, too.
I forgot about that down payment I helped you guys with.
It was so long ago.
Anyway, yeah.
Nice birthday surprise.
You gave him my money, didn't you?
Your money? I thought you said it was our money.
Why would it be our money?
You didn't even know my uncle Remus.
Wasn't it Cyrus?
I think I would know the name of the saint
that practically raised me.
I forgot to give grandpa his birthday crown.
Wait a minute. What's this?
Does Lily have a fur?
Oh, boy.
Yeah, uh, let's see.
Oh, it's from Schwartzman's, huh?
The same store that you and Lily
just love to browse in every sunday after brunch.
Well, if you must know, it was a surprise gift for you.
Now it's going back, because you're a thief.
Oh, well, then, I want to try it on.
No!
I want to try it on.
You'll just get attached.
Well, it's a present for me,
so I should be able to have a fitting of some sort.
Of course it needs altering.
Since when do you wear right off the rack?
I'm just not comfortable with Vesuvius over there.
I hope you can get your money back.
"Money back" -- there it is.
There's a shadow that's been cast
over this relationship for quite a while now.
Is this about that time you were sleepwalking
and came in my tent and kissed my neck?
Somnamorousness --
the condition no one wants to talk about.
You're right about that.
This is actually much more embarrassing.
I just found out you lent us money for our down payment.
So...
Here.
Paid back in full.
Phil, is this because Mitchell --
No. This is for me -- for us.
And though it may be long overdue,
thank you.
You're welcome.
Probably seems awkward, but...
It's happening.
...could you throw that apron on me?
You're not sleeping again?
Maybe we should have another pot of coffee.
That's a weird word, huh? Coffee. Coffee. Coffee.
Amateur.
Doctor! I need your help.
I've been drinking this tequila,
and I cannot find the worm.
I think I just swallow it.
That's very serious.
That worm could eat your insides in a matter of hours.
Well, there must be something she can do.
Drink pickle juice.
The worm cannot survive in pickle juice.
Is this enough?
Just.
Thank you, doctor. I'm feeling better already.
You got lucky.
The only other treatment is to freeze the worm to death
by lowering the body temperature with an ice bath.
I feel it inside of me.
No. I think it's inside of me.
I knew we should've poured the tequila in your bellybutton.
That's why they have these systems in place.
I heard an expensive car pull out.
I figured you were in it.
Oh, yeah, that was Will going to the hospital.
I just came to get my dress.
Um, he gave me this card, but he writes like a doctor.
Can you read it for me?
No. That sounds way too personal.
Ohh, come on! I visited you in the hospital.
Just do it!
Nah, I'm okay.
Can you just see if you can read it? I can't.
I'd rather not.
Can you even read?
Can you please try?
I'll try. Yeah, no, I'll try.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
"Dear Haley, I know how eyes work,
but I never knew how they sparkled
until I met you.
I know how hearts work,
but I never knew they could sing
until I met you.
Love, Will."
Oh, crap.
Really? I thought it was kind of sweet.
The doctor part, then it circled around back to you.
Why does he have to be so into me, you know?
We met like two weeks ago.
A gold heart! Really?
I just -- I guess I'm just more into the chase right now.
You know, like, the fun.
I'm just not looking for anything serious.
Well, it's good you know what you want --
Before anyone got hurt.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Of course I have the receipt.
Ow!...Kay, what if I didn't?
Oh, there she is!
Okay, everybody, I want to make a toast!
Oh, any excuse.
To my brilliant daughter...
So, not you.
...who worked for 12 years to get into Caltech,
the most prestigious college --
Mom, it's really not a big deal.
Oh, honey, wait, wait, wait -- you said yourself
it's the best scientist school in the country.
Well, I most definitely did not use those words.
Congratulations, Alex.
We expect great things from you --
unlike some of the other children in this family.
Well, I snagged a doctor,
so she must be talking about you.
I'm very proud of you.
Okay, well, I haven't even decided.
I still might go to my safety school.
Great. Now this.
If she goes to the other place,
it's even more expensive.
It's not gonna happen. Please.
She's just trying to punish me.
And don't worry about the money. I got my bonus.
Yeah.
Wait. What? What did you do?
Did you pay back my dad? Please, please, please.
No, no, no.
Yes, I did.
Not that it changed anything.
Okay, don't be mad at Phil.
He's not the bad guy here. He is.
Look at him, sitting over there
like he's the king of the world.
What father takes money from his own children?
Not like he needs it. He lives in this palace.
Meanwhile, our whole family's
sharing a bathroom the size of his closet.
I know. I've paced it out.
Okay, what about me?
My tears have barely dried,
he stole my inheritance,
and I'm left holding the bag for two fur coats.
T-two?!
I can get three seasons of use out of it.
Hey, this might give you a chuckle.
That money you all paid me back --
It's gonna cover the cost of that t-bird.
Isn't that funny how stuff works out?
It sure is funny.
That's hilarious.
I can't. It's too cold.
It's either cold for
5 minutes or cold forever.
Come on.
Funny -- I always thought I'd be found dead in a bird suit
at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.
You still will, buddy.
You still will.
If I ever catch you drinking again,
your whole school is going to see this picture.
Sh-sh-she tricked us.
I know.
As soon as we kill this worm, we're gonna get her back.
There's...no...worm!
Not gonna help, kid.
You're right.
I can't drown my problems in alcohol.
Well, you can, but that's water.
You're not really gonna turn down Caltech?
Oh, please don't tell me what a great school it is,
how I'm gonna graduate in two years,
and they're gonna name a country after me.
You're feeling some pressure.
What if I'm the dumbest one there?
Someone has to be.
I could get there, be dumb,
have a nervous breakdown --
You're going. I know you.
You've never backed down from a challenge your whole life.
Now, I could lie to you and tell you it's gonna be easy.
Well, do that. I'm vulnerable.
I'll believe you.
It's not. It's gonna be hard.
But you and I both know this is something you have to do.
'cause if I don't, I'll regret it my whole life.
I know, I know.
Yeah, that's part of it.
Let's take a ride. Want to show you something.
You're not gonna drive me into a bad neighborhood
to show me how lucky I am, are you?
Well, I would still have my money
if she hadn't tricked Mitchell.
Oh, and it's a shame you don't, Cam.
'cause then you could buy another one of those coats.
Well, I didn't get anything I wanted!
Jay didn't even like the world's most perfect grill.
Come on!
The family needs a leader,
and I can't do it forever.
You can handle it.
Do I have to?
Heavy hangs the head.
You know, college might not be such a big, scary place
if I drove up the first --
Not gonna happen.
Okay.
Your brother's in a bit of a spot money-wise,
and I don't want to embarrass him,
so how about if I say
I'm giving you both a gift?
That way, he doesn't feel like a charity case.
Well, if it's to help Mitchell...
Thank you, honey.
S-still s-so cold.
M-maybe some coffee would warm us up.
You have a problem.
So, listen, how about if I say
I'm giving you both a gift?
That way, your sister --
We'll take it.
Yeah.
Lily, we can get the hats.
Yeah!
