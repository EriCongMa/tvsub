you &apos;re telling me this actress person ...
... is the only woman you ever wanted who didn &apos;t want you back ?
oh , my god .
is this what it &apos;s like to be you ?
you &apos;re crazy about her , huh ?
you have no idea .
when we &apos;re on stage , i get to kiss her and touch her .
she goes home with the director ...
... and it &apos;s like somebody &apos;s ripping out my heart .
oh , it &apos;s so great to see you feeling like this .
dad called this morning .
aunt sylvia passed away .
we were all pretty shaken up about it .
am i missing something ?
i thought death was supposed to be sad , in a way .
well , aunt sylvia was ...
... not a nice person .
she was a cruel , cranky old bitch .
and i &apos;m sorry she died .
did dad say i get the dollhouse ?
you get the dollhouse .
i get the dollhouse !
a house for dolls ! that is so cool .
when i was a kid , i had a barrel .
you had a barrel for a dollhouse ?
no , just a barrel .
you know what ? you can play with my dollhouse .
really ?
any time you want .
when i was young i wanted to play with this dollhouse .
but no ! it was to be looked at , never played with .
my grandmother said the same thing to me .
more of a bathtub @-@ type situation .
she did give you one chance .
she told monica she could play with the dollhouse if she lost 20 pounds .
yeah , well , look who &apos;s losing weight now , aunt sylvia .
the one with the doll house
thanks for lunch . you didn &apos;t have to walk me here .
that &apos;s okay . no problem .
you realize we don &apos;t keep the women &apos;s lingerie here .
yes , i realize that .
summer catalog .
that &apos;s the stuff .
rachel , i need the versace invoice .
you don &apos;t work for me .
joanna , this is my friend chandler bing . joanna .
bing ? that &apos;s a great name .
it &apos;s gaelic for , &quot; thy turkey &apos;s done . &quot;
i &apos;m gonna go . nice meeting you .
you too .
so what &apos;s wrong with him ?
nothing . he &apos;s just goofy like that . i actually hardly notice it anymore .
i mean , is he married or involved with anyone ?
he &apos;s not married or involved with anyone .
actually , you know what ? forget it .
i &apos;ll ask him for you , if you want .
would you ?
or is it too sad and desperate , like something sophie would do ?
i am here .
i know that .
look at it !
wallpaper &apos;s a little faded . that &apos;s okay .
carpet &apos;s a little loose .
hardwood floors ? !
it &apos;s so beautiful !
i know !
so i &apos;m here , ready to play !
i brought a bunch of stuff for the house , so check it out .
what &apos;s this ?
that &apos;s a dog . every house should have a dog .
not one that can pee on the roof .
maybe it &apos;s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste .
and is this in case the house sneezes ?
no , that &apos;s the ghost for the attic .
i don &apos;t want a ghost .
well , nobody wants a ghost .
but you &apos;ve got one ...
... because the house is sitting on an ancient lndian burial ground .
wait a minute . the house was built on radioactive waste ...
... and an ancient lndian burial ground ?
that would never happen .
obviously you don &apos;t know much about the u.s. government .
i need to talk to you .
sure . what &apos;s up ?
oh , sorry . i meant chandler .
i know .
well , if something comes up ....
i &apos;m glad you guys are past that little awkward phase .
my boss . joanna . when you left ...
... she started asking questions about you ....
liked what she saw ?
dug my action , did she ?
checking out the chan chan man !
that was ...
... surreal .
what do you think ? are you interested ?
she seemed cool . attractive . i &apos;ll do it .
thank you , chandler . this is great . she &apos;s gonna love me .
dinosaur attack ! quick , everybody into the house !
all right , phoebe , you know what ? that &apos;s it . that &apos;s it .
no dinosaurs , no ghosts , no giant dogs , okay ?
they &apos;re not the right size , they &apos;re not victorian and they don &apos;t go .
fine .
come , dinosaur . we &apos;re not welcome in the house of no imagination .
while we &apos;re on the subject , i have to say that dinosaurs ...
... they don &apos;t go , &quot; ruff ! &quot;
the little ones do .
hey , kate .
morning .
i went to that restaurant you talked about
hey , lovely .
come , talk to me for a minute .
i ate the food . it was good . i had the fish .
i &apos;m lauren . kate &apos;s understudy .
joey tribbiani .
i know .
i &apos;m a big fan of yours .
what ?
i used to schedule my classes so i could watch dr. drake ramoray ...
... on days of our lives .
get out of here . really ?
absolutely .
but then they dropped you down that elevator shaft .
they gave me the shaft , all right .
you &apos;re so funny .
what are you doing after rehearsal ?
you want to get a drink ?
sure . a drink sounds great .
cool . i &apos;ll see you then .
all right .
all right . it &apos;s time to act , my talking props .
lf you wanna make the boys &apos; bathroom realistic ...
... you &apos;re gonna have to put some teeny , tiny porno magazines behind the toilet .
look everybody ! look at my new dollhouse !
look , look !
hey , what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a slide instead of stairs . look .
very interesting , phoebe .
what &apos;s this ?
the licorice room . you can eat all the furniture .
and when guests come over , they can stay on the tootsie roll @-@ away bed .
this is the coolest house ever !
does anyone want to join me in the aroma room ?
all right .
i would .
hey , guys ? guys !
did you see my new china cabinet ?
watch . watch .
and ? and ?
hey , my father &apos;s house does that .
how did it go ? tell me everything !
the movie was great ...
... dinner was great , and there &apos;s nothing like a cool , crisp new york evening .
of course , i didn &apos;t enjoy any of that because joanna &apos;s such a dull dud !
chandler is fantastic !
what ?
you know how people just click ?
he came by to pick me up , i opened the door and it was just like , &quot; click ! &quot;
did he tell you ?
doesn &apos;t he have a good heart ?
and he &apos;s so sweet . he said he &apos;d call , so put him straight through .
lsn &apos;t this great ?
don &apos;t spoil it .
come on , baby , don &apos;t go . please ?
what do you say ?
it &apos;s you . just one sec .
i &apos;m going to take this call .
when i continue , i hope there will appear on @-@ stage ...
... this magical thing that in the theater we call ...
... committing to the moment !
the guy &apos;s like a cartoon .
what do you see in him , anyway ?
he happens to be brilliant .
which is more than i can say for that sweater you &apos;re dating .
i &apos;m not interested in her sweater .
it &apos;s what &apos;s underneath her sweater that counts .
and besides ...
... since when do you care who i &apos;m with ?
i don &apos;t care . why , do you want me to care ?
do you want me to want you to care ?
do you ?
what ?
okay . i &apos;m afraid to say this , but let &apos;s pick up where we left off .
come on , baby , don &apos;t go . please ? what do you say ?
i &apos;ve got no reason to stay .
stop !
stop it ! you must stop !
you are bad actors !
this is a terrible play !
i &apos;ll see you in the morning .
i can &apos;t believe we go on in a week .
hey , it &apos;s gonna be all right .
since we &apos;re getting off early , do you want to go paint mugs ?
what ?
at the place i told you about last night ?
yeah , with the mug @-@ painting .
i was so listening to that .
but you know what ? i need to work on my stuff tonight .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
are you okay ?
i guess .
what are we gonna do about the scene ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe if it had more heat .
well , how do you mean ?
adrianne &apos;s looking for a reason to stay , right ?
victor can &apos;t just kiss her . he &apos;s gotta ...
... he &apos;s gotta give her a reason .
maybe he could slip her the tongue .
or maybe ...
... maybe he could grab her and lift her up .
then adrianne could wrap her legs around his waist .
she could do that .
and claw at his back .
then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest and stomach .
then he could use his teeth to undo her dress and ...
... and bite her !
then right when the scene ends , he could take her ...
... with this raw , animal ....
something like that ?
that &apos;s pretty much what i had in mind .
it &apos;s a little early to be drinking .
things finally happened with kate .
you &apos;re kidding ? that &apos;s great .
it was so amazing .
after the lovemaking ...
oh , my .
... i just watched her sleep for hours .
just breathing in ...
... and breathing out .
i knew she was dreaming because ...
... her eyes kept going like this .
i &apos;m telling you , she &apos;s got it all wrong .
all i said was , &quot; this was fun . let &apos;s do it again sometime .
i &apos;ll give you a call . &quot;
i wonder why she thinks you &apos;re going to call her ?
it &apos;s what you say at the end of a date .
you can &apos;t just say , &quot; nice to meet you . good night ? &quot;
to her face ?
l &apos;m so happy .
lt &apos;s the end of the date.i &apos;m standing there ...
... she &apos;s waiting for me to say i &apos;ll call her ...
... and it comes out . i can &apos;t help it .
it &apos;s a compulsion .
when a guy says he &apos;ll call , it doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s going to call .
this never happened to you ?
well , they always called .
bite me .
did he call ?
no , sorry .
why ? he said he &apos;d call . why hasn &apos;t he called ?
maybe he &apos;s intimidated by smart , strong , successful women .
sophie , will you please climb out of my butt .
why hasn &apos;t he called , rachel ? why ?
maybe he feels awkward because you &apos;re my boss .
awkward ? why should he feel awkward ?
you didn &apos;t tell him not to call me , did you ?
if you &apos;re uncomfortable with your friend dating me ...
... there are always ways to fix that .
call her . call her now !
multiple so many paper cuts .
&quot; why hasn &apos;t he called , rachel ? why , why ? i don &apos;t understand ! &quot;
i &apos;m telling you , she &apos;s flipped out ! she &apos;s gone crazy !
well , give me the phone then .
she thinks it &apos;s my fault you haven &apos;t called her .
you have to call her .
you can &apos;t call somebody after this long to say :
&quot; in case you didn &apos;t notice , i don &apos;t like you . &quot;
then you &apos;ll have to take her out again .
she &apos;s really dull , and she gets this ...
... gross mascara @-@ goop thing in the corner of her eye !
i don &apos;t care !
you &apos;ll take her out again and end it ...
... in a way she knows it &apos;s ended .
i don &apos;t care how hard it is . don &apos;t tell her you &apos;ll call her again !
all right , fine !
but just lunch . from now on , i get my own dates .
i don &apos;t want you setting me up again !
that &apos;s fine !
that &apos;s just a lot of big talk .
i know .
i &apos;m in the shower !
fire ! there &apos;s a fire ! fire !
i talked to lauren . i told her how things were with us .
did you talk to marshall ?
about what ?
about what happened with us .
no , there &apos;s really no reason why he should find out .
so let &apos;s not make a big deal out of it , okay ?
what are you talking about ?
it was a big deal .
you can &apos;t tell me last night didn &apos;t mean something to you .
i was there . you &apos;re not that good an actress .
i was just caught up in the moment .
that &apos;s all it was .
joey , i &apos;m sorry you feel bad , but ...
... haven &apos;t you slept with a woman and it meant more to her than to you ?
hi , kate.-hi , lauren .
hi , lauren .
hi , pig !
sorry i scared you in there .
it &apos;s okay .
by the way ...
... i was just checking the shower massager .
i tried to reach you at work .
there &apos;s been a fire .
what ? oh , my god !
what happened ?
we believe it originated here ...
... in the aroma room .
did everyone get out okay ?
the giraffe &apos;s okay , and so is the pirate .
what &apos;s this ?
no , don &apos;t look !
you don &apos;t want to see what &apos;s under there !
the foster puppets !
it &apos;s not a big deal . it &apos;s right here , and it &apos;s all the time .
thanks again for lunch .
this was pleasant .
lt was , wasn &apos;t it ?
the food there was great .
wasn &apos;t it ?
so take care .
you too .
i &apos;ll give you a call . we should do it again !
great . i &apos;m looking forward to it .
any messages ?
sophie &apos;s desk .
are you gonna call her ?
i &apos;m sorry , okay ? i &apos;m weak and pathetic and sorry .
you are gonna tell her . you &apos;ll tell her now .
i &apos;m not gonna call you .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry i said i was going to when i &apos;m not .
lt &apos;s just that l was trying to be nice , and you don &apos;t deserve that .
l see. l think .
this has nothing to do with you .
and this isn &apos;t rachel &apos;s fault . it &apos;s me .
i have serious problems when it comes to women .
i have issues with commitment , intimacy ...
... mascara goop .
i &apos;m really sorry . it &apos;s just that ...
... this isn &apos;t going to work out .
this isn &apos;t how i was hoping this would end ...
... but i guess i have to appreciate your honesty .
i &apos;ll give you a call . we should do it again sometime !
anyway , beth , what i &apos;m saying is ...
... i should have considered your feelings before i went home with you .
i &apos;ve recently learned what it &apos;s like to be on your side ...
... and i &apos;m sorry .
do you think you can forgive me ?
great . thanks .
hello , jennifer ?
hi , mrs. laurio . is jennifer there ?
she &apos;s not home , huh ?
