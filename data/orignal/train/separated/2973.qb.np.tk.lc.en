oh , that sounds good .
hey , rach , you &apos;re leaving tomorrow . shouldn &apos;t you be packing ?
it &apos;s all done .
oh , yeah , right .
and after i took a shower this morning , i just threw my towel on the floor .
oh , god , it hurts to even joke about it .
i know .
honey , seriously , i did it all . the luggage that i &apos;m taking is in the bedroom .
this is emma &apos;s paris stuff . these are the boxes that i &apos;m having shipped ..
and that &apos;s the sandwich i made for the plane .
which could &apos;ve used a little more mustard .
okay , so you &apos;ve done some good work .
yeah .
what about your carryons ?
oh , well , everything that i need is in here ..
and my travel documents are on the counter ..
organized in the order that i will be needing them .
oh , my god . i have nothing left to teach you .
where &apos;s your passport ?
it should be next to my plane ticket .
well , it &apos;s not .
what ? well , maybe i put it in here ?
oh , it &apos;s not in there !
oh , no , i must have packed it in one of these boxes !
here , let me help you .
shoot .
i can &apos;t believe i did this .
at what point did it stop being funny that i took her passport ?
the.one.with.rachel &apos;s.going.away.party
oh , wow , can you believe you &apos;re only three weeks away ?
i know .
you don &apos;t mind me touching your belly ?
i don &apos;t mind you touching my belly ..
but your hand &apos;s kind of blocking the part where the baby &apos;s gonna come out .
hey !
hey .
hi , erica . welcome back to town . wow , look how big you &apos;ve gotten .
that &apos;s because i &apos;m pregnant .
right . no , i understand .
oh , okay .
i &apos;m just always afraid that people think i &apos;m just fat with big breasts .
no , no , i knew .
okay , well , stop staring at them .
she brought them up .
i didn &apos;t realize you were coming back so soon .
in a couple weeks i won &apos;t be able to travel .
and i wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel .
why isn &apos;t she staying with you guys ?
because we &apos;re moving in a couple days .
plus , hotels are fun ! my room has this little fridge full of free snacks .
erica , those things aren &apos;t free .
they have one of the highest markups of any consumer product ..
ross , she &apos;s giving us her baby . she can eat you if she wants .
i &apos;ll be right back .
oh , man , i can &apos;t believe you guys are leaving this place .
i know . i know .
you know , you could take it if you want . the lease is still in nana &apos;s name .
no , no . this will always be your place . it would be too sad .
plus , how much a month does it cost to feed joey ?
yeah , it takes two incomes .
is chandler here ? we talked about catching a movie .
oh , no , he doesn &apos;t have time for that .
you can go help him and joey pack up the guest room .
packing . sexy cheerleader comedy .
helpful brother . creepy loner at teen movie .
what are you guys doing ?
try it . i can &apos;t feel a thing .
are you kidding ?
this is packing ?
we &apos;re taking a break .
from ?
jumping on the bed .
all right , rachel &apos;s party is in a couple of hours , and there &apos;s a lot to do .
ross , you &apos;ve got geller blood . you &apos;re in charge of these yahoos .
you got it .
all right .
all right , she &apos;s right . we gotta get serious .
let &apos;s put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him !
no , guys , she &apos;s right . we should get to work . i &apos;ll take stuff out of the closet .
joey , you pack them , and ross , you repack whatever joey packs .
you guys hear a ringing ?
what the hell is this ?
hey , handcuffs . and fur @-@ lined . nice .
i didn &apos;t know you guys had it in you .
chandler , you don &apos;t have a sister , so you can &apos;t understand ..
how much this bums me out .
i didn &apos;t know monica had these .
maybe she used them with another boyfriend . maybe richard .
why would she use them with richard and not me ? i can be kinky .
i once did a naked dance for her with scarves .
bumming hard , guys . bumming hard .
hey .
hey . where &apos;s mike ?
oh , he has a gig .
it &apos;s kind of like being married to a rock star , you know ?
my husband has a gig .
yeah ? where is it ?
oh , he &apos;s playing organ for a children &apos;s roller @-@ skating party .
rock on !
wow , this is quite a spread . what is all this stuff ?
i thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food ..
that i don &apos;t want to move to the new house with me .
so enjoy . smoked oyster casserole with a breakfast @-@ cereal crust .
kidney beans in their own juices , and for dessert , a questionable orange .
well , i think i speak for everyone when i say :
hey .
hey .
where &apos;s rach ?
she &apos;s putting emma down .
she &apos;ll be over in a second . it just hit her that she &apos;s leaving .
she &apos;s kind of emotional , so no one say anything to set her off , okay ?
hey , rach .
hey .
there she is .
hi , you guys .
what did i just say ?
oh , no , no , no , it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m gonna be fine .
come here , i &apos;ll make you a drink .
okay .
oh , man , i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s actually leaving .
how am i gonna say goodbye to rachel ?
i know , she &apos;s been such a big part of my life .
it feels like when melrose place got cancelled .
i mean ..
forget it , i miss melrose place .
i had a chance to stop her too .
yeah ?
who loses 57 coin tosses in a row ? you know ?
heads , she wins . tails , i lose .
wait a minute .
yes , joe ?
i forgot to pick up my dry cleaning .
so you doing okay ?
well , i &apos;ve been better . you guys are gonna come visit , right ?
yes ! you know , in six months , the statute of limitations runs out ..
and i can travel internationally again .
i &apos;m gonna miss you so much .
i know .
you know what ? i have some goodbye stuff that i wanted to say ..
to each of you . i was gonna save it till the end of the night , but come here .
hey , what do you think they &apos;re doing in there ?
if i had to guess , i &apos;d say ..
rachel &apos;s putting on the bubble wrap , and phoebe &apos;s doing the punching .
phoebe , i don &apos;t even know where to start .
okay , well , before you do , i know we weren &apos;t supposed to get you presents ..
but i do have something for you .
what is it ?
well , it &apos;s a cotton swab ..
with a bit of my saliva on it ..
so that if they perfect the cloning process while you &apos;re over there ..
you can use the dna to create your own phoebe .
i &apos;m gonna throw this away ..
but thank you so much for the gesture .
chandler ?
i was just in our bedroom , and i found these on my pillow .
oh , yes , i decided to leave those out for you in case richard stops by ..
and you want to engage in a little light bondage and mustache play .
what ? these aren &apos;t mine .
oh , yeah , right !
good luck getting another scarf dance from me .
that would be a terrible punishment .
but i &apos;m serious , i &apos;ve never seen these before .
really ? then what are they doing in our guest room ?
rachel used to live in that room .
rachel . with handcuffs .
interesting .
joey &apos;s bare ass .
well played .
i love you , phoebe .
i love you too .
please ..
please don &apos;t ..
don &apos;t turn into , you know , a french bitch .
i won &apos;t .
all right . well , if i &apos;m gonna do this , i better keep going .
okay .
okay .
monica ?
yeah ?
will you come with me for a minute ?
sure .
are you wearing waterproof mascara ?
no .
oh , you &apos;re so screwed .
hey .
what was that all about ?
she &apos;s gonna say goodbye to each of us individually .
are you kidding ? oh , my god .
yeah , i know . it &apos;s gonna be even worse for you . god .
well , just get ready to do some serious crying .
man , i &apos;m not gonna be able to handle this .
now i know how my students feel at the end of each year .
and why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations .
mon . okay .
i better just say what it is i &apos;m gonna say .
none of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last 10 years ..
would have happened if it wasn &apos;t for you .
no one has been more like a sister to me .
i know what you mean .
you &apos;re like a sister to me too .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m going to do without you .
you &apos;re the greatest friend i ever had .
seeing you every day .
what ?
i .. i .. i ..
see you every day !
that is so sweet !
oh , no , she took down monica .
and i &apos;m the crier in the family .
oh , god , i could be next .
maybe she won &apos;t talk to me if it looks like we &apos;re deep in conversation .
oh , so that thing you said about the thing ..
it really made me think about that other thing .
rach ?
oh , it &apos;s okay , chandler &apos;s talking to her .
i really made you think about that thing , huh ?
rach , i think i have something that belongs to you .
i &apos;m sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that i don &apos;t get .
no , no , they &apos;re really yours . we found them in your old room .
these aren &apos;t mine . maybe monica used to use them with ..
don &apos;t say richard .
well , if they &apos;re not monica &apos;s and they &apos;re not yours , then whose are they ?
i think you &apos;re forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room .
phoebe !
yeah !
i think these are yours .
these are not mine . look how flimsy they are . come on .
my god , you try to hang a guy from a water pipe with these ..
they &apos;ll snap like a piece of licorice .
can i talk to you alone for a minute ?
sure .
you don &apos;t really handcuff guys to water pipes do you ?
where do you think mike really is ?
oh , honey ..
let me just saying something because once we get into this ..
i &apos;m gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke .
i just want to say that i .. i love you .
and i &apos;m gonna miss you .
and i &apos;m so sad that you &apos;re leaving .
oh , you know what ?
let &apos;s not say anything else .
i love you .
not so tight .
i &apos;m sorry , give me one more chance .
okay .
okay .
i &apos;m sorry . just go . just go . i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t .
so i guess you &apos;re next . you ready ?
i don &apos;t think so .
oh , you &apos;re definitely not . i haven &apos;t cried like that in years .
you cried yesterday at the 6 : 00 news .
that old woman was being scammed by her mechanic .
god , i can &apos;t believe she saved me for last .
why are they taking so long ?
i don &apos;t know . but , god , joey seems to be handling it surprisingly well .
no !
no ! joey !
okay , here we go .
well ..
yeah .
i think i &apos;m gonna take off .
i have such a big , big day tomorrow , so ..
rach .
yeah ?
aren &apos;t you forgetting something ?
oh , right . ross .
yes ?
i forgot to write your mom a birthday card . would you please do that for me ?
sure .
thank you .
oh , you guys , this was an amazing night . thank you so much .
i love you .
good night .
what ? !
i don &apos;t get a goodbye ?
lucky bastard .
unbelievable . she says goodbye to everyone but me !
well , maybe she thought that with all of your history , it could be ..
you know , implicit .
well , it needs to be &quot; plicit . &quot;
you know , maybe she was just really spent from our talk .
it was pretty intense .
yeah , mine too .
mine was a humdinger .
okay !
all right , let &apos;s think about this . i mean , there &apos;s gotta be an explanation .
did you do anything to make her mad ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
you didn &apos;t , say , borrow her girls gone wild video and never return it ?
really ? now ?
i mean , don &apos;t i deserve anything ? i mean , a few tears , a cursory hug ?
not from you !
ross , if you &apos;re this upset , you should go and talk to her .
and say what ? you owe me a goodbye ?
i mean , he &apos;s got more pride than that .
the hell i do !
i don &apos;t get a goodbye ?
what ?
everyone gets a goodbye but me ? what do i gotta do to get a goodbye ?
be best friends with you ? go out with you ?
have a baby with you ?
oh , wait a minute . wait a minute ! i did all those things !
or maybe i &apos;m just not giving you ..
enough credit . i mean , it is difficult to say goodbye to five people .
goodbye , goodbye , goodbye , goodbye , g ..
it &apos;s physically impossible !
you know what ? after all we &apos;ve been through ..
i can &apos;t believe this is how you want to leave things between us .
have a good time in paris .
rach , i know this may not be the best time ..
but joey &apos;s going over the balcony again . could you just come talk to him ?
i hope ross isn &apos;t too upset .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s not more bummed out ..
than i am .
tell me about it .
well , you can &apos;t say we don &apos;t know how to throw a party .
i think i &apos;m gonna head out .
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
i thought i was going home to bed ..
but i &apos;m sensing there &apos;s something less fun for me to do here .
we &apos;re moving , and we got a lot of packing to do .
it &apos;d be great if you guys could pitch in .
joey and i can finish up the guest room .
yeah , good idea .
oh , no . you and phoebe are gonna help me in here .
you couldn &apos;t be cool .
we &apos;re gonna start in the kitchen .
plates get put into plate protectors and stacked 10 to a box .
the silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped . got it ?
yeah .
good . i need you to be careful ..
and efficient . and remember , if i &apos;m harsh with you ..
it is only because you &apos;re doing it wrong .
hey , mon , i think i figured out whose handcuffs they are .
you did ? how ?
well , i was cleaning out the closet ..
and i found some pictures of them ..
being used .
oh , my god , let me see .
who &apos;s that dirty old lady ?
monica &apos;s grandmother .
oh , my god . nana liked it rough !
hi .
hey .
what are you guys looking at ?
oh , just normal pictures ..
of our regular family not having sex .
oh , here , have a seat .
yeah .
how was your night ?
oh , it was okay .
i went to a movie with my cousin then out for dinner .
we went to this place that had ..
anyway , they had these really amazing cheeseburgers .
erica , are you okay ?
yeah , you know , maybe i ate too much .
i keep getting these stomachaches . they come and go every few minutes .
oh , my god .
relax , we &apos;ll just get her some antacids .
she doesn &apos;t have a stomachache ! she &apos;s in labor !
oh , my god !
yeah , you gotta get to the hospital !
chandler , get the coats ! erica , let &apos;s go ! phoebe and joey , keep packing !
oh , my god , we &apos;re gonna have a baby .
we &apos;re gonna have a baby !
oh , my god , we &apos;re gonna have a baby !
oh , god , i &apos;ve gotta sit down ! i &apos;ve gotta sit down !
honey , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
you can do this . just breathe .
okay . okay .
okay , i feel a little better .
are you sure ?
yes , i &apos;m sure . oh , honey , let &apos;s go .
okay .
come on , let &apos;s go .
okay , bye , everyone !
we &apos;re having a baby !
good luck !
chandler , wait , wait , wait !
what ?
if you get a second , find out where she got that cheeseburger .
&quot; dear , judy .
happy birthday , love rach .. &quot;
no . you know what ? i &apos;m not doing this .
you think i didn &apos;t say goodbye to you because i don &apos;t care ?
that &apos;s what it seemed like .
i cannot believe that after 10 years you do not know one thing about me !
then why didn &apos;t you say something ?
because it is too damn hard , ross !
i can &apos;t even begin to explain to you how much i am gonna miss you .
when i think about not seeing you every day , it makes me not want to go .
okay ? so if you think that i didn &apos;t say goodbye to you ..
because you don &apos;t mean as much to me as everybody else , you &apos;re wrong .
it &apos;s because you mean more to me .
so there , all right ? there &apos;s your goodbye !
rach !
what ?
you keep .. you can &apos;t ..
what ?
a little more .
okay .
a little more . a little more .
all right .
little more .
all right . all right , let &apos;s do this .
all right , ready ?
yep . now give me your best shot .
all right . here goes .
