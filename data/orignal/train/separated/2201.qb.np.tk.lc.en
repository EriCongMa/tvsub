what do you want from him !
gabriel wants me to transfer all my assets
to a holding company he controls .
gabriel got away with the money that was meant to buy
his freedom from the yakuza .
without it , we &apos;re both dead .
it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t love you .
i do .
but i have to go away for a little bit .
how long ?
the truth is , i don &apos;t really know .
if you leave today , i can &apos;t ... i can &apos;t wait for you .
not anymore .
i &apos;ll always ...
always love you .
it should be right off this trail .
over here . i think i see it .
holy mother lode !
take everything .
zingiber zerumet-- it &apos;s great for hair masks and conditioners .
and there &apos;s cocos nucifera-- i can use it for skin toner .
and don &apos;t forget the eye cream .
i don &apos;t believe it !
vanilla planifolia orchid .
chanel uses it in theirs .
it retails for $ 350 an ounce !
we might actually make some real money this year .
is that ... ?
just get it !
drop the flower .
where is it coming from ?
who cares ?
oh , my god !
matter of fact ... i &apos;ll be real glad
when williams gets back on his feet again
so i can drive my own damn truck .
yeah , i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll appreciate
the sentiment and the eggplant parm .
yeah , well ,
guy goes under the knife to save his kid ,
the least i can do is make sure he gets a decent meal .
speaking of which , you got any plans tonight ?
weird segue .
no , i don &apos;t .
well , good . renee &apos;s taking the kids to the movies , so ...
i figure you and me , we can go to rumfire ,
have some beers , some pu @-@ pu &apos;s ...
okay , stop , stop , stop , stop .
i know what you &apos;re doing ; you don &apos;t have to do that , okay ?
do what ? what are you talking about ?
you don &apos;t have to babysit me , lou .
catherine left-- it sucks ,
i &apos;m hurting a little bit , but it &apos;s happened before .
a , b , i &apos;m gonna be fine , all right ?
brother ... let me explain something to you .
there &apos;s only one way to get over a woman walking out on you ,
and it involves you , me and that bar .
gonna help me get back on the horse ?
no . i just figured we &apos;d go over there and get good and drunk .
why ? what &apos;d you have in mind ?
hold on .
yeah , mcgarrett .
yeah . we &apos;re on the way .
no , we &apos;re not .
i &apos;m on the way . i got this .
go make sure our boy &apos;s okay .
you sure ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure . just don &apos;t go hogging
all the credit for the eggplant parm , would you ?
guess what ? you get to drive your truck after all .
congratulations !
lucky day .
manager from a local dealership called it in .
turns out those two were trying
to buy a $ 90,000 sports car with counterfeit cash .
ah , but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
the lab says that the money came from the same batch of bills
that your old friend miko mosley was printing in his bathroom .
yeah , well , miko was dropping that money all over the island
before he was killed--
guess it was just a matter of time
before some of it started turning up .
okay , well , how does it all end up with these two dimwits ?
l @-@ like we told the sergeant , we didn &apos;t know the money was fake .
we believe you .
thank you .
but here &apos;s the problem .
the person that printed that money--
who , by the way , is dead--
was trying to use it to bankroll a drug operation ,
which is why we need to know how it ended up with you .
you don &apos;t think we believe you had all that money on you
from selling that crazy beatnik hand cream , do you ?
是一群摈弃传统生活和行为方式的年轻人
okay , look , we found the money in the makua forest .
we can ... show you where .
so not only do you two take money that doesn &apos;t belong to you ,
but you also decide to bury the body .
we were trying to be respectful .
get these two idiots out of here .
let &apos;s go .
what do you got , max ?
no i.d. on the vic .
c.o.d. was a single carbon arrow through the chest .
pierced the sternum and punctured the heart .
i estimate t.o.d. to be between 4 : 00 and 6 : 00 a.m.
murder by bow and arrow .
that &apos;s kind of a unique m.o. for this century .
you know what , though ? i can understand the appeal .
arrows are quiet , untraceable , accurate from a distance .
so , we got a remote location , middle of the night .
i &apos;m thinking maybe it could &apos;ve been a money drop .
and maybe the killer , seeing right away
that the money is counterfeit , just leaves it here .
or maybe it wasn &apos;t about the money at all .
maybe he just lured our victim out here ,
shot him from a distance ,
and it was actually a carefully planned @-@ out hit .
whatever the case may be , this funny money
is starting to become a magnet for dead bodies .
it &apos;s now directly or indirectly tied to three murders .
so , where are we going , gentlemen ?
you &apos;ll know when we get there .
little cliche , i know .
personally , i would have preferred to meet over tea ,
but in this case i &apos;m afraid it was impossible .
tom bishop .
i work for goro shioma .
you &apos;re not japanese .
very perceptive .
so am i here about the money ...
or the men who were shot outside my home ?
we &apos;re satisfied you had nothing to do with that hit .
as for the money ...
out of respect to your late father ,
mr. shioma wants to resolve the situation peacefully .
and for that i am grateful .
but it has been weeks ... and he &apos;s grown impatient .
i &apos;m sure you can understand that .
listen , i have friends ...
looking for gabriel waincroft as we speak .
i &apos;m aware of your relationship to five @-@ o.
in the meantime , we &apos;ve been pursuing our own leads .
jamesはここにいるか 。
連れてこい !
this is aaron james ,
one of gabriel waincroft &apos;s most trusted soldiers .
if anyone knows gabriel &apos;s whereabouts , it &apos;s him .
i find it hard to believe you brought me here
just to watch you beat the information out of him .
like i said , you &apos;re very perceptive .
no , we &apos;re not gonna question him .
you are .
gentlemen , unfortunately your victim is still a john doe .
no hits on the fingerprint or dna .
i mean , i ran a facial rec across all databases .
unfortunately , there were no matches .
so this guy gets it with close to a million dollars
in counterfeit money on him .
you would think he &apos;d at least have some kind of rap sheet .
or at least be in the system for something , right ?
judging from his appearance and lack of any records ,
i &apos;d say it &apos;s more than likely he was homeless .
oh , quite the contrary , lieutenant .
vintage rolex , designer clothes .
all the items found on your victim &apos;s body were high @-@ end .
my best guess would be mid @-@ 80s .
looks to me like this guy didn &apos;t get out much .
that &apos;s an understatement .
blood work shows there was a severe deficiency
in vitamin d due to lack of sun exposure .
that &apos;s hard to pull off in hawaii .
so , this guy , he hasn &apos;t been in the sun or bought clothes
since reagan was president .
that sounds like someone who doesn &apos;t want to be found .
how does this guy end up suddenly in the middle of nowhere
with an arrow sticking out of his chest
and close to a million dollars in fake money ?
look , if he was off the grid for 30 years ,
we need to find out what he looked like back in the day .
that could give us the i.d. that we &apos;re looking for .
age progression software uses sophisticated modeling
to predict visual changes in a person as they get older .
however , the software can be used to age @-@ reverse a subject as well .
can it bring back my afro ?
i think my old lady would dig it .
hold on , stop it right there .
what , you recognize this guy ?
yeah . you know what ? call jerry .
he &apos;s gonna love this .
our vic &apos;s name is harrison crane ,
and at one point ,
he was the richest man in hawaii .
that is , until he pulled a howard hughes
and dropped off the face of the planet .
other than a few unconfirmed sightings ,
no one &apos;s seen or heard from the guy in over 20 years .
so one day the guy &apos;s on the cover of the society pages ,
and the next day he just up and vanishes ?
how come ?
that &apos;s one of the island &apos;s great unsolved mysteries .
and as contributing author to crane &apos;s wikipedia page ,
i can tell you there are a lot of theories .
some say he fled the country to dodge the irs ,
others think it was a psychotic break ,
and there are some who have posited
that it could have been an abduction .
and by &quot; abduction , &quot; i mean alien abduction .
clearly , the guy was holed up somewhere on the island .
well , he did have properties all over oahu .
he was actually the sole heir to a real estate fortune
worth millions-- except that when he died ,
there was no one left to manage any of it .
yeah , we &apos;re talking primo properties in kahala and waimanalo ,
completely abandoned and left to fall into disrepair .
to this day , you can find homeless people
squatting in vacant beachfront mansions
crane never even bothered to evict .
which pissed off the neighbors
when they saw their property values take a nosedive .
well , hell , that sounds like a good motive .
you take a bath on your house ,
the whole thing is crane &apos;s fault--
you figure out a way to draw him out and kill him .
yeah , i &apos;m not so sure about that .
i just came from the lab .
so , they matched the dna off the arrow
to a recently released ex @-@ con named ano kahue .
when the cops went to pick him up ,
he immediately confessed .
he said that he was out hunting
and he saw what he thought was a boar moving through the brush .
when he discovered he &apos;d killed crane ,
he panicked and fled the scene .
and he left all that money there ?
yeah , when i asked him about that ,
he said that killing crane was an accident
but taking the money would have been stealing .
ex @-@ con with a moral compass .
he also offered to take a polygraph ,
so i &apos;m inclined to believe him .
okay , so our murder was actually a hunting accident .
still doesn &apos;t explain what crane was doing
in the middle of nowhere with a million in counterfeit cash .
uh , turns out there is someone we know
that might actually have some answers .
the lab found some prints on a bunch of the bills .
remember this weasel ?
gerard hirsch .
shady art appraiser .
and , if i recall correctly ,
he was quite smitten with you .
uh , sure , until he realized i was a cop
and he either had to cooperate or go to jail .
yeah , well , either way ,
looks like this bird hasn &apos;t learned his lesson yet .
no , hpd busted him with a bunch of forgeries .
he just got out of halawa last month .
all right , how do we find him now ?
well , jordan , you are a man of many varied interests .
you know something , buddy ? this one &apos;s on the house today .
how about that , huh ?
huh ? you like that ?
thank you .
thanks for visiting our island .
officer kalakaua , i see you &apos;re displaying your badge today .
ah . yeah . you know , when your p.o. said you &apos;d be here ,
we expected to find you sipping moet by the pool .
not this . what can i say ?
times are tough .
the particulars of my parole forbid me
from participating in any art transactions .
isn &apos;t this technically an art transaction ?
really ? you &apos;re gonna write me up
for selling caricatures for 30 bucks a pop .
$ 30 ? ! i should . right now .
no , we got you on something much bigger . let &apos;s go .
doesn &apos;t make sense .
in the 15 years i &apos;ve worked here ,
mr. crane never once left the property .
when was the last time you saw him ?
a few months ago , maybe .
i leave his meals and laundry by the door to his quarters .
if he needs something , he just leaves me a note .
so you &apos;re saying you &apos;ve never been inside ?
as far as i know , no one other than mr. crane
has ever stepped foot beyond that door .
yeah ?
well , that &apos;s about to change .
well , crane obviously didn &apos;t keep up
with the latest decorating trends , but , uh ,
the man was quite tidy .
this place is like a time capsule .
if i pass out ...
take over filming for me .
jerry , you do know that the crime lab
is gonna take pictures of everything , right ?
oh , these are for my personal collection .
i &apos;ll tell you , man , i &apos;ve seen some crazy in my day ,
but what kind of guy just up and decides
he wants to live like this ?
someone with a severe case of ocd .
take a look .
book , comb , glasses , pen and watch .
random items ... yet they &apos;re arranged alphabetically .
yeah , and look at these cans .
it looks like a grocery store in here , all the labels facing out .
this is a person who is obsessed with getting things in order .
oh , that goes a long way to explain
why he was so terrified of the outside world .
lou .
yeah ?
you notice what &apos;s different about these pictures here ?
they &apos;re the only ones that aren &apos;t ancient .
everything else is from before crane went full recluse .
this guy has no family , and up until a day ago
he never even left the house .
why is he holding on to this girl &apos;s picture ?
i don &apos;t know .
but these photos do look like they were taken recently ,
so if we can find her , maybe we can get some answers .
who &apos;s the homeless dead guy ?
all right , don &apos;t insult us .
you know it &apos;s harrison crane .
and we know the two of you have been in contact with each other .
i believe you &apos;re mistaken .
in fact , i &apos;m quite sure that no one
has been in contact with crane for quite some time .
that guy made j.d. salinger look like a social butterfly .
you done ?
okay , good . maybe you can explain to us
how your prints got on almost $ 900,000 worth
of counterfeit cash that he had on his person when he died .
hold up .
counterfeit ?
that little weasel .
sorry ?
a few weeks ago i sold some paintings
to this gangster wannabe named miko mosley .
yes , i &apos;ve been dealing art again .
put me in solitary .
anyway , mosley paid me in cash ,
cash that i in turn gave to crane .
but i had no idea that money was fake .
okay , wait . so you can identify phony artwork but not currency ?
my dear , spotting a bogus van gogh is one thing ;
a bogus benjamin is a different skill set .
okay , today we don &apos;t care about counterfeit cash ,
we don &apos;t care about parole violations--
we want to know about crane and what the money was for .
a painting .
crane called me late last night .
he was trying to unload this very lovely edward hopper
that i actually had sold him 25 years ago
back when i was first starting out .
he offered to sell it to me cheap ,
like way below what he could get for it at auction .
i thought he was kidding , but ...
sure enough , i showed up with the cash ,
and i left his house with the painting .
okay , wait .
there &apos;s plenty legitimate art dealers out there ,
so why come to you ?
well , he said he needed the money right away .
and it had to be in cash .
for others , that was a deal breaker .
he was desperate .
i see , uh , someone put a ring on that .
yeah , beat you to it .
unlucky you .
chin , what do you got ?
well , looks like crane may not
have been as cut off from the outside world as we thought .
we found several recent photographs
of a young woman at his place--
facial rec i.d. &apos; d her as laura ioane ,
30 years old , local .
okay , what &apos;s crane &apos;s connection to laura ?
i &apos;m not sure , because we can &apos;t seem to find her .
her cell phone &apos;s turned off and her boss says
she didn &apos;t turn up to work this morning .
hey . that mcgarrett ?
yeah .
all right , check this out .
crane has a landline here
and it hadn &apos;t been used in years ,
until last night he gets a phone call from a burner cell .
right after that , he calls this laura
six times in a row-- all the calls went unanswered .
hold on a minute .
we got six frantic phone calls to a woman that we can &apos;t find ?
that &apos;s right-- followed by our vic headed out
to this secluded spot with a bag full of money .
the whole thing adds up to just one thing .
crane was on his way to a ransom drop .
this is a kidnapping .
jimmy , keep him on ice for me .
you got it , commander .
all right . let me know .
all right , so the burner the kidnapper used had been turned off .
csu will track it if it powers back up .
our biggest problem right now is the media--
we cannot let the news of crane &apos;s death get leaked , okay ?
if the kidnapper finds out crane &apos;s body &apos;s in the morgue ,
he &apos;s gonna cut his losses and kill laura .
it &apos;s been hours since crane missed the ransom drop--
our kidnapper &apos;s gonna know something went wrong .
yeah , the kidnapper also knows that
he chose an unpredictable , eccentric target .
my guess , he &apos;s gonna practice patience ,
eventually he &apos;s gonna call back .
in the meantime , we need to figure out
what the connection between laura and crane is .
her name is laura ioane . you know her ?
did something happen ?
she was kidnapped .
your client was called to pay the ransom ,
but he was killed before he could deliver it .
counselor , i &apos;m sorry that we have to be the ones
to deliver this information , sir ,
but we need to know about the connection between your ...
your client and laura .
yeah .
laura &apos;s mother peggy was a waitress
at a coffee shop in waipahu
harrison used to frequent back in the &apos; 70s .
they became romantically involved .
it didn &apos;t last long .
once harrison &apos;s issues started getting in the way ,
he ended it .
but peggy was always his one true love ,
and after she died , harrison took it upon himself
to provide for her daughter .
laura &apos;s father was a deadbeat ,
and so harrison directed me to set up a trust in her name .
at the time , he did this solely out of his love for peggy ,
but as the years went by , he grew quite fond of laura .
and then the two stayed in touch , trading letters .
who else knows about this ?
i honestly couldn &apos;t say .
harrison didn &apos;t speak to very many people ,
especially in recent years .
and , uh , of course , i was barred
from ever mentioning laura to anyone .
what about laura ? was there anything
to stop her from discussing her connection to crane ?
well , it &apos;s no secret harrison guarded his privacy ,
so i imagine laura would have respected that--
but to answer your question ,
no , she could have told whomever she wanted .
you know , not long ago ...
i was in the same predicament you are .
so i know what &apos;s going through your mind .
stall for time .
right now that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about .
i &apos;m not stalling .
i &apos;ve told you everything .
you &apos;ve given me some light background on gabriel &apos;s organization .
that &apos;s trivial .
what i need ...
is gabriel &apos;s present location .
not where he was last week
or where he &apos;s gonna be in a month .
i don &apos;t know how many different ways i can say it ,
but i can &apos;t give you information that i don &apos;t have .
i don &apos;t believe you .
more importantly , those men out there--
they don &apos;t believe you .
if you want to get out of here alive and in one piece ,
you &apos;ll tell me what i want to know .
if you don &apos;t , they &apos;ll kill you .
adam .
you &apos;re getting nowhere .
you want to break this guy , it &apos;s gonna take more than words .
threats mean nothing to a man like this .
and by the way ,
don &apos;t think for a second that if he walks out of here
he &apos;s not gonna come after you , because he will .
he &apos;ll come after you and everyone you care about .
starting with that lovely wife of yours .
that supposed to scare me ?
the ivy league boy
who gave up everything for some piece of ass
is gonna get rough ? please .
where is gabriel ?
where is he ? !
you can keep doing this until your hand breaks
and you &apos;re gonna keep getting the same answer .
let &apos;s find out .
all right , thanks .
okay , so a search of laura &apos;s apartment came up empty .
no signs of a break @-@ in or struggle .
okay , clearly , the abduction happened elsewhere .
let &apos;s get location data from her cell carrier , all right ?
that &apos;s gonna give us a list of places
that laura went to frequently .
chances are she got picked up from one of them .
copy that .
hpd &apos;s also looking into laura &apos;s friends and relatives ,
cross @-@ referencing for any criminal records .
okay , good .
jerry ...
you all right ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
take a look .
details are sketchy , but we can confirm
the body of reclusive real estate magnate harrison crane
was found in makua forest early this morning .
a police investigation is underway
and we &apos;re hearing reports that
this may have been a hunting accident .
however , there &apos;s no official statement
from the honolulu police department .
she &apos;s probably dead already , isn &apos;t she ?
mr. crane had no known family and
hadn &apos;t been seen or heard from in more than 20 years .
one silk handkerchief , one fountain pen ,
one set of keys , one cell phone .
sign here .
and this thing has been ringing like crazy .
thanks .
go for gerard .
you should really answer your phone , mr. hirsch .
who is this ?
shut up and listen to me very carefully .
so he wants the painting ?
yes , and he threatened to kill this laura ioane woman
and come after me if i don &apos;t hand it over .
that &apos;s a pretty desperate play .
my question is how did he even know about the hopper ?
well , he probably had crane under surveillance
from the moment he put this thing in motion .
if that &apos;s the case , last night when you went to crane &apos;s house
he would have seen you leave with the painting .
well , he said he would call back
with a time and place for the drop .
well , that &apos;s perfect . when he does ,
you keep him talking , we &apos;ll run a trace .
what we have to do , though , is get the painting back .
so where is it now ?
actually , i don &apos;t have it anymore .
i flipped it to a collector this morning .
then get it back .
that might prove difficult . this particular collector
is not what i would call a friend of law enforcement .
in fact , he &apos;s a russian crime lord .
alexander kozlov .
i never heard of him .
well , if you had , he wouldn &apos;t be doing his job very well .
well , crime lord or not , we need to get that painting .
we could try appealing to his better angels ,
but i think that &apos;s a nonstarter .
or we could just take it back .
that &apos;s a much better plan .
assuming the painting is still on the island .
what ?
why wouldn &apos;t it be ?
because there &apos;s a good chance that kozlov &apos;s people
were planning to smuggle it out today .
i forgot to mention this earlier , but the hopper
actually fell off the back of a truck 25 years ago .
it &apos;s a stolen piece .
anything else ?
look , if this painting disappears ,
then our girl dies .
is your foot even on the gas ?
there &apos;s a reason we always take danny &apos;s car , okay ?
i see why .
uh , they wouldn &apos;t just toss a $ 3 million painting out the window .
hold on .
out of the car !
there it is , center lane !
go over there . careful !
steve !
all right , get him in here .
hirsch , let &apos;s go . you &apos;re up .
this it ?
is this the hopper ?
yep , that &apos;s it . good as new .
so i guess my work is done here , right ?
not quite .
this is hideous .
put it on . you don &apos;t have a choice .
if you &apos;re gonna make a shirt with a built @-@ in wire ,
why can &apos;t it be practical and stylish ?
this shirt just might save your life .
if it doesn &apos;t , don &apos;t let me get buried in it .
okay , how does it look ? honestly ?
you look fine .
okay , so , look , we &apos;ll be listening in
and have eyes on you the whole time .
first sign of trouble , we move in .
can i at least wear a bulletproof vest ?
why ? if they shoot you ,
it &apos;ll be in the head .
oh , terrific . well what if i say no to all this--
what then ?
then laura dies
and you go to jail for a very long time .
but if you pull this off , i will personally
make sure that all the outstanding charges against you disappear .
you know , you &apos;re the reason
i &apos;m in all this mess to begin with .
if you hadn &apos;t honeypotted me ,
i never would have fallen for that sting .
i &apos;m sorry-- honey @-@ what ?
you used your feminine charms to entrap me .
i was just doing my job .
maybe so .
but you can &apos;t deny
there &apos;s ... something between us .
it &apos;s him .
okay , you &apos;re on .
hello ?
do you have the painting ?
yes .
good .
take the 22 bus to waikiki beach .
get off at ohua . and make sure you come alone .
wait , um ...
how do i find you ?
keep your phone on .
okay . let &apos;s go .
got him .
okay , be advised ,
hirsch just landed .
copy . i got eyes on him .
yeah , same here .
facial rec is up and running .
we &apos;re live scanning the crowd right now .
nobody moves until the drop is done
and the kidnapper has the package in hand .
where is this guy ?
hello ?
cross the street .
okay , hirsch is on the move .
copy that .
he &apos;s crossing kalakaua at ohua .
kidnapper &apos;s got a signal bouncer on his phone .
we can &apos;t trace it .
the restaurant at the corner .
head inside .
hey , we &apos;re about to lose visual .
all right , everybody hold your positions , all right ?
do not blow cover .
do not blow cover .
okay , i &apos;m here .
give your name to the hostess--
she &apos;s expecting you .
he hung up .
gerard hirsch .
that was fast .
your friend just called to say you &apos;d be picking it up .
must have fallen out of his pocket at the bar .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
well done . now dump the phone you came in with
and head to the gift shop .
you &apos;re gonna buy some new clothes .
guys , what &apos;s going on here ?
hirsch should still be in there . gps on his phone
show he hasn &apos;t moved .
if this deal goes down inside ,
we &apos;re gonna lose this guy .
we lost audio . his wire &apos;s down .
kono , move in .
copy that .
lou , back her up .
you got it .
what do you got ?
guys , i &apos;m not seeing him .
keep looking .
that &apos;s good . keep walking straight .
when you get to the corner , you &apos;re gonna turn right .
now keep moving until you get to the park bench facing the ocean .
i see it .
the guy feeding the pigeons--
sit down next to him .
okay . what now ?
leave the bag and walk away .
when i know i &apos;m not being followed ,
we &apos;ll release the girl .
guys , i got hirsch .
he just passed uluniu and he &apos;s headed south .
he changed his clothes .
he &apos;s over there ! he &apos;s over there !
kidnapper &apos;s on the move . he &apos;s headed right to you .
we &apos;re moving in .
move !
stop right there ! five @-@ 0 !
he &apos;s dead .
laura &apos;s not here .
thanks .
got his phone . already checked him for i.d. &apos; s .
got nothing .
no registration papers either .
it &apos;s because it was stolen . it was called in this morning .
let &apos;s get csu out here .
see if we can get an i.d. on this guy .
if we can get an i.d. , maybe we can get an address ,
find where he &apos;s holding laura ...
gotta see this .
... maybe find an accomplice he &apos;s been partnered with .
wait . he does have a partner .
how do you know ?
he told me .
he said once he knows he &apos;s not being followed ,
&quot; we &apos;ll release the girl . &quot;
okay , so the partner is sitting on laura ,
waiting to hear that the drop went down .
look at this .
the last ten calls made from this phone
went to the same number .
&quot; mom &quot; ?
what kind of kidnapper loves his mother that much ?
let &apos;s find out .
did you get it ?
mikey , are you there ?
you recognize that voice ?
don &apos;t move !
where is he ? where &apos;s my son ?
where &apos;s laura ? tell us now .
grover , stay on her .
chin , kono , follow me .
we &apos;re gonna search every inch of this place .
she &apos;s got to be here somewhere .
turn around .
that man trusted you .
and you betrayed him .
he shut the whole world out but let you in .
what , did you find out about laura ?
saw an opportunity to get yourself a little payday ?
all about the money .
i just wanted to help my son .
you don &apos;t understand .
my mikey had it rough his whole life .
always deserved better .
i just wanted to give him a chance .
we were never gonna hurt her .
chin ! kono !
we need to move this .
go .
laura , it &apos;s okay . we &apos;re five @-@ o. give me your hand .
give me your hand . you &apos;re gonna be all right .
it &apos;s okay .
we got you . it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay .
so what do you think ?
he &apos;s telling the truth-- he doesn &apos;t know where gabriel is .
okay . well , we tried , right ?
right .
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s all on you now .
we can &apos;t just wait around for gabriel waincroft to surface .
that day may never come .
so as of now , the clock &apos;s officially ticking .
mr. shioma wants what you owe him .
and he wants it soon .
how the hell does goro expect me to come up with that kind of money ?
my business is gone .
i could sell everything i have ,
and it wouldn &apos;t be close to enough .
you &apos;ll figure it out .
and then you &apos;ll do whatever &apos;s necessary ,
even if it means getting your hands dirty .
i think you proved today that you &apos;re capable of that .
look who &apos;s here .
hey , boss .
i see you spread the word .
i might have mentioned it in passing .
come on , steve , we &apos;re here for you .
yeah , man , as long as lou &apos;s paying .
aw , see , that &apos;s wrong .
i like the sound of that .
yeah , i &apos;ll bet .

i came bearing gifts .
look at that .
cartoon .
what ? you drew these things ?
look at that . that &apos;s cute .
made one for you , too .
it &apos;s ramble .
detail &apos;s amazing .
you might have gone a little overboard on the abs .
i had to use my imagination a little bit .
excuse me , miss , can you get this gentleman a beer , please ?
he &apos;s got some catching up to do .
thank you very much .
hey , so i just got back from the hospital .

in the next couple of days .

scrumptious .
i had my eye on her earlier , but i &apos;ll stand down .
