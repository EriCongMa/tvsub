back in the 80 &apos;s @-@ this is what we did after school
we &apos;d prepare a feast of our favorite sugary snacks
in preparation for an endless tv marathon .
in those days ,
our parents didn &apos;t pack our schedules to keep us occupied .
that honor went to whatever the three networks chose
to randomly broadcast ,
and it was glorious .
i was watching that !
i know .
then why &apos;d you change it ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t care .
i thought that was clear by now .
dude .
it &apos;s like you have no respect for me at all .
it is like that , yes .
i demand your respect ! give it to me right now !
respect isn &apos;t given . it &apos;s earned .
you never get off your lazy butt .
when i was your age , i went to school and i had two jobs .
oh , yeah ?
i &apos;ll go out right now and get an awesome job ,
and then you &apos;ll have to respect me .
and i &apos;ll learn responsibility and earn my own money
and never depend on you for anything .
you &apos;re threatening me with things i want you to do !
this is on you .
no , no , no . stop .
come back here and be a weight on my spirit .
unlike barry ,
my sister worked her way up to assistant manager at gimbels .
erica , you really have a flair for style .
your bandana work is flawless .
thank you .
what the -- stop it !
hey ! it &apos;s me ! barry !
i told you to never come where i am .
awesome news --
you &apos;re getting me a job so dad can respect me .
oh , good luck with that .
i &apos;ve been working my whole life ,
and he still calls me &quot; the girl one . &quot;
erica , if your brother is half as good as you ,
he &apos;s hired .
chuck , i think if you &apos;ll give my brother a quick interview ,
you &apos;ll have all the info you need .
so , tell me -- what &apos;s your greatest strength ?
easy -- bo staff .
no ! wait .
busting fresh rhymes .
no ! wait .
handsome .
no ! wait .
i was literally born without fear .
i &apos;ll let you know .
boom ! he &apos;ll let me know .
he didn &apos;t , but barry refused to quit looking .
my biggest weakness ?
i &apos;m honest , and i &apos;m lazy .
what &apos;s your biggest weakness ?
who do i think would win a fight between a tiger and a bear ?
that &apos;s a good question .
one you didn &apos;t ask , but i &apos;ll discuss .
minimum wage ?
no , no , no .
what &apos;s maximum wage ?
it was april 15 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and my mom &apos;s day was about to be rocked to its very core .
boopie , what &apos;s this ?
spanish test .
&quot; f &quot; ? as in &quot; fail &quot; ?
no , no . that &apos;s literally humanly impossible .
my children don &apos;t fail .
i &apos;m as stunned as you are .
maybe it means &quot; f &quot; as in &quot; fabulous &quot; or &quot; first prize . &quot;
i @-@ i knew you would say that , so i asked .
it &apos;s &quot; fail . &quot;
my teacher said maybe i &apos;m better off moving down a level .
as in remedial ? !
oh @-@ ho , no !
are you mad ?
yes , i &apos;m mad -- at your teacher !
senora taraborelli ?
you think this is her fault ?
well , it &apos;s certainly not your fault .
you &apos;re just a little boy .
that &apos;s true . i am a little boy .
a genius little boy .
please -- be nice .
she &apos;s a lovely but fragile woman .
well , i &apos;m lovely and pissed .
okay . i got to stop you before this gets nuts .
clearly , this is the one subject the kid struggles in .
you can &apos;t blame the teacher . it &apos;s the boy .
it takes a very special educator
to teach such a strange , exotic language ,
with all the squiggles over the letters
and the crazy upside @-@ down question marks
and the &quot; rrrrrrrrrrr &quot; s .
that right there is what you call beverly goldberg mom logic .
what do you mean he failed drivers ed ? !
yep , my mom could explain away our failures
by perfectly placing the blame on anyone but us .
you &apos;ve got your own pedal in there .
i think you slammed on the brakes yourself
and sabotaged my son .
change the grade .
change the grade .
change the grade .
change the grade .
change the grade .
change the grade .
change the -- oh , that &apos;s nice .
my mom would now apply mom logic to
why i sucked at spanish .
look , adam is so smart , and he tries so hard ,
but , you know , he just can &apos;t keep up with the other kids .
uh , i see the situation slightly differently .
how &apos;s that ?
i see it as entirely your fault .
mrs. goldberg ,
i have been teaching spanish for well over a decade .
and have you adequately kept up with changes to the language ?
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s set in stone .
have you ever even traveled to any of these spanish places ?
no , not on a teacher &apos;s salary , but look , i &apos;m saving money ,
and i intend to find myself in san juan , drinking cervezas
with a very fiery caribbean lover
who will take me in his taut , muscular arms ,
and together , we will dance the forbidden dance .
the lambada .
that is ... very graphic .
i &apos;m sorry . look , i just --
you know , if adam is struggling , i suggest you find a tutor .
excellent . when can you start ?
me ?
no , no .
that would be a conflict of interest .
oh , it &apos;s really not .
i mean , the school pays you to teach .
why can &apos;t i pay you more to teach him more ?
in this case ... 50 bucks an hour
to help fund your sensual adventure ?
well , that is very generous ,
but i would not feel right about --
did you say $ 50 ?
yep , mom logic even managed to win over
my earnest , buttoned @-@ up teacher .
the lure of the forbidden dance is calling you .
well , that and the promise of a sensual , silk @-@ shirted senor .
meanwhile , my brother had somehow
landed his very first job .
... and the in @-@ depth pizza @-@ box @-@ folding tutorial .
so , any questions ?
nope . i &apos;m good .
are you ?
this entire operation rests on you delivering our food hot and on time .
don &apos;t you worry .
every street in this city
can tell you a story about barry goldberg .
some are ... pretty hard to talk about .
lot of bad memories .
i , uh , i struggle with stuff .
point is , i know the streets good .
hope so .
&apos;cause this may be the pizza depot ,
but we &apos;re closing in fast on the big boys over at domino &apos;s .
see , they &apos;ve tipped their hand
and revealed the secret to the pizza @-@ delivery gold standard ,
and that &apos;s the avoidance of this man .
the noid .
oh , yeah -- the funny guy from the commercials .
funny ?
this floppy @-@ eared goblin is a physical manifestation
of the challenges inherent in getting a hot pizza delivered on time .
the noid is evil , and he never sleeps .
he makes pizza cold . i &apos;m familiar with the noid .
are you ?
&apos;cause he &apos;s the wolf at the gates who will stop at nothing
until he destroys us and everything we hold dear .
are you afraid now ? huh ?
no .
he &apos;s a cartoon .
you &apos;re cocky , rookie .
i like that .
look at you !
how was the first day on the job ?
not bad at all .
made a ton of dough .
pizza dough .
it &apos;s a joke we say around the shop ,
because &quot; dough &quot; is another word for &quot; money &quot;
but we also cook with it .
i got to admit , i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d go through with it .
but hard work like this deserves something special .
what &apos;s this ?
bottle of suds .
it &apos;s about time you had a beer with your old man .
what the hell is this ?
uh , just a little father / son thing .
dad &apos;s giving me a beer &apos; cause i &apos;m a working man .
what ? i work , a @-@ and i like beer .
i &apos;ve said too much . i should go .
just to be clear , this is a one @-@ time thing .
i can &apos;t believe this is happening .
oh , believe it .
this frosty cold one is a rite of passage ,
a symbol of my respect .
son , you are no longer a moron .
you are a man .
this is too much . i &apos;m freaking out .
don &apos;t freak out .
i &apos;m freaking out !
don &apos;t freak out .
the hell was that ? !
i panicked ! i @-@ i didn &apos;t know what to do !
you drink it ! you don &apos;t slap it across the room !
i know that now !
let &apos;s just put a pin in this .
while barry was struggling with his newfound respect ,
i was hoping my new tutor
would end my struggles with el espanol .
gracias , dave kim .
ah , paco . how &apos;d we do ?
no buena .
no ? oh , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s not that bad .
oh , boy .
okay .
why don &apos;t you go ahead and just , uh ,
eh , take another look at 3 .
and 6 .
and 11 .
really ?
wow . great .
me puedes ... pasar ...
los zapatos ?
oh , yeah . you taught me that .
see ? i knew you knew it .
well , thanks .
adios .
oh , very good .
squishy !
i knew you could do it !
congrats , kid .
let &apos;s hear a little bit of the old espanl .
well ... i &apos;m not quite ready to talk and stuff .
me and my tutor / teacher work mostly in english .
really ?
yeah , she &apos;s got this amazing technique
where even if i don &apos;t know i know the answer ,
she reminds me i do know it by telling it to me .
my baby &apos;s learning .
little senor .
you see what &apos;s going on , right ?
you mean the way his little face
gets more delicious the more you look at it ?
i mean this teacher clearly gave him the answers
&apos;cause you paid her .
oh , poop . she did not .
that would be cheating .
yes , it is cheating .
no , it is tutoring -- during the test .
it &apos;s a totally different thing .
for once , stop with the mom logic .
that &apos;s not a thing .
oh , it is .
it &apos;s how you sleep at night
even though you know he &apos;s learned nothing .
but he thinks he &apos;s learning ,
and thinking is learning .
again , mom logic .
if cheating &apos;s the only way adam can do well ,
just do him a favor and drop him down to remedial .
fxxx that .
adam can learn six languages ,
because he is perfect and anything but remedial !
mom logic .
after a half day of rigorous training at the pizza depot ,
barry was confident he &apos;d crush his first day of deliveries .
he did not .
glen oaks ? !
i need oak glen !
where am i ?
sadly , barry was in oak ridge .
he was lost , and this meant sheer panic .
see , back then , our cars didn &apos;t have navigation systems
or cellphones with google maps .
barry &apos;s only choice was to wrangle an actual map
and stress @-@ eat .
oh , no !
i &apos;m not paying for this , bro .
why ?
well , first of all , you &apos;re an hour and a half late .
and , secondly ...
... you clearly ate a piece .
dude , you don &apos;t understand .
if you don &apos;t pay me , it comes out of my check .
oh . i didn &apos;t realize that .
you &apos;re fired .
what ? ! why ? !
&apos;cause you &apos;re the noid .
i am not the noid !
you have successfully delivered four pizzas .
you know it .
out of 37 .
please don &apos;t fire me .
just take the mistakes out of my check .
oh , i did , until there was no check left .
you now owe us $ 314 .
this is a job .
you pay me . i don &apos;t pay you .
yeah . that &apos;s how it usually works .
yet here we are .
a noid knocking a noid down .
how ironic .
as my brother was losing his job ,
i was getting a &quot; b &quot; in spanish , and it felt awesome .
well , to me .
hola , friendos !
who &apos;s ready por esloppy joses for lunch @-@ o , eh ?
what &apos;s with the silent treatment ?
are you guys mad at me ?
adam , everyone knows what &apos;s going on
with you and senora taraborelli .
you mean my tutoring ?
seems like a little more than that .
dana .
babe , it &apos;s me .
i would never step out on you like that .
no one thinks you &apos;re dating the spanish teacher , dude .
we study for hours just to pass ,
while you get to cut all the corners .
corners ? no !
i &apos;m getting tutored , and i &apos;m excelling .
trust me -- it &apos;s all on the up @-@ and @-@ up .
in fact , i bet she &apos;d tutor all of us .
no -- no . no , no , no , no , no , no .
there has been a huge misunderstanding .
if it &apos;s the money , i bet you my parents will pay double .
oh . no . no .
my family owns a restaurant .
help me out , and you could be ass @-@ deep in crab rangoon .
wha--
left my wallet there on the desk .
i &apos;m gonna turn around and count to three .
if it turns up empty , so be it .
dave kim knows nothing in life is free .
you can &apos;t quit !
things have gotten completely out of hand .
dave sirota put a $ 10 bill in my waistband
and told me to &quot; think about it . &quot;
well , what about san juan ?
the lambada !
who am i kidding ? !
it &apos;s a forbidden dance ! i &apos;m not allowed !
anyone can dance that dance .
look , monday , we &apos;re doing our oral presentations .
and if adam doesn &apos;t pass ,
he &apos;s being moved down to remedial spanish .
but we had a deal .
well , that deal is off .
i &apos;ll just spend another summer in ohio ,
sleeping on the couch ,
because mother &apos;s cat has priority of the bed .
while my disgruntled teacher was shutting down my mom ,
barry was keeping up the illusion of still having a job .
there he is ! working man !
how was your day ?
good .
and i am definitely not the noid .
well , i want to show you something .
the whole beer thing didn &apos;t work out ,
because you &apos;re a moron .
but this -- this here -- this is our moment .
come here .
and just like that ,
my father gave barry the ultimate sign of respect --
the la @-@ z @-@ boy .
i get my own chair ?
and that &apos;s not all .
and the remote ?
last time i touched this thing ,
you threw a photo cube at my head .
well , times have changed .
you used to be this boy ...
and now you &apos;re this man .
and that means you get to choose what we watch .
and you chose a grown man in tights .
what the hell is this ? !
first beer , and now a chair ?
and the remote .
last time i touched that thing ,
you threw a photo cube at my head .
well , it &apos;s different for me &apos; cause i &apos;m a working man .
hello ? ! i &apos;ve been working my whole life !
this is a total double standard .
no , it &apos;s not .
dad &apos;s just giving me special treatment
&apos;cause i &apos;m a boy and you &apos;re not , so you lose .
that &apos;s the definition of a double standard , you idiot !
seriously ?
and why do you keep watching that ? it &apos;s so weird !
i wish i could move my hips like that .
erica refused to sit back
and let barry rub his newfound respect in her face ,
so she went to his job to let him have it .
i told you -- you can &apos;t sit here all day !
just give me one more chance .
no , no , no . you don &apos;t work here anymore !
now beat it , noid !
fortunately for her , there was no job .
don &apos;t you worry , schmoo .
your teacher may have failed you , but not your mama .
i will see to it that you ace that oral presentation .
you &apos;re even worse at spanish than i am .
it &apos;s hopeless . i should just go down to remedial .
a presentation has nothing to do with knowledge .
it &apos;s all about flash .
i &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s all about spanish words .
oh , no . it &apos;s about showmanship .
you &apos;re a natural performer , and with my help ,
you will dazzle them with your talent , grace , and dignity .
that &apos;s right -- beverly goldberg &apos;s mom logic
convinced me that i could pass a spanish test
without the use of actual spanish .
me gusto mucho &quot; pet cementerio . &quot;
muy bueno , dave kim .
okay .
y finalmente ... senor goldberg .
this was it -- go time .
with the help of my trusty assistant ,
an exotic musical score from faraway lands ,
and one he @-@ man pinata ,
i would ace my spanish class .
maracas !
guacamole !
by today &apos;s standards , the content was questionable .
salsa !
salsa !
salsa ?
and sure , i borrowed heavily
from the stereotypes i saw in the movies .
&quot; the three amigos . &quot;
man , did i kill it .
what a wonderful summary of a very beautiful and vibrant culture .
okay .
but you didn &apos;t answer the question .
for once ,
beverly goldberg had no mom logic
to cover up the fact that i was a literal failure .
erica knew barry &apos;s secret
and how it would crush him if my dad found out ,
which is exactly why she made sure that was gonna happen .
that &apos;s me . i ordered pizza .
yes !
pizza ! pizza !
ohhhh , crap .
pizza .
that &apos;ll be $ 314 .
what ? !
erica ? how many toppings did you order ?
none . you owe him money
because you lost 33 pizzas .
who gets a job and ends up owing them money ?
me !
i &apos;m sorry .
i finally had your respect , and i got fired in two days .
eh , don &apos;t beat yourself up .
wait -- what , now ?
eh , he &apos;s going through a rough patch .
did i ever tell you about the time
that i got fired from the deli for refusing to wear a hairnet ?
are you actually bonding with him over getting fired ?
what is wrong with you ? !
i &apos;ve babysat , i &apos;ve tutored , i &apos;ve sold hot dogs on sticks
and oranged thousands of juliuses .
and in all that time , you never showed me a shred of respect .
erica , wait !
as my dad realized there really was a double standard ,
my mom finally accepted it was time to lower hers .
how &apos;s my little pinto bean ?
don &apos;t .
you used my love of performance against me ,
and i completely embarrassed myself .
i know . and i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just that ...
i always see you as my perfect little angel .
and when the world doesn &apos;t agree with me ,
i go a little nuts .
a little ?
okay , a lot .
look , i realize no one &apos;s perfect .
god knows i &apos;m not .
but when it comes to you ...
i can never see you any other way .
i guess that &apos;s not the worst thing in the world .
hey , mama ?
i don &apos;t know what that means , but ... it &apos;s beautiful .
sure , my family
didn &apos;t always speak the same language .
luckily , i learned just enough spanish
to tell my mom how i really felt
without her ever really knowing .
go away .
not until we talk .
what &apos;s there to talk about ?
you &apos;ve made everything pretty clear .
look , even though barry &apos;s a moron ,
he &apos;s a lot like me .
i get him .
and the reality is , i was never a teenage girl .
well , that &apos;s a relief to hear .
what i mean is ,
i just wanted to have the big rite of passage with my son ,
when i should have been having it with my daughter .
here &apos;s to you . you &apos;re a man now .
thanks , dad .
what the -- what is this ? !
you are in big trouble , missy !
but dad just -- - i caught her with these .
oh , my ...
you are so grounded !
you &apos;re lucky your dad got here before me !
so lucky !
that &apos;s the thing about growing up .
sometimes you take the fall
or you struggle to make the grade .
looks like the remedial class is more my speed .
you are so going to harvard .
i &apos;m not , but sure .
i made dinner .
and sure , you may be far from perfect ,
but with your family close by , life comes pretty darn close .
you know , i wish you &apos;d fight over my salads like that .
me niego de contestar esta pregunta .
esta clase es tan aburrida .
imuy bien , clase !
adios .
adios .
how many years of experience do i have as a cpa ?
let me answer that with a follow @-@ up question .
what is a cpa ?
this kid &apos;s head is weird .
are you related ?
i &apos;ve got fresh rhymes
and i gotta pay my bills
you &apos;ve got a lot of grime
and i got some cleaning skills
then i put the second piece of tape this way ,
and i &apos;m a pig !
hire me .
