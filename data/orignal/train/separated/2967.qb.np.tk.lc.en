oh , i &apos;m sorry , honey .
but when she said &quot; sex , &quot; i wasn &apos;t thinking about sex with you .
it &apos;s like a giant hug .
ross , how about you ? which would you give up ?
food .
how about sex or dinosaurs ?
oh , my god , it &apos;s like sophie &apos;s choice .

look , there &apos;s chandler .
who &apos;s the blond ? she &apos;s pretty .
he &apos;s having an affair .
he is not having an affair !
i &apos;m always right about these things .
no , you &apos;re not . last week , you thought ross was trying to kill you .
well , sorry , but it &apos;s hard to believe that
anyone would tell a story that dull .. just to tell it .
there &apos;s something going on with them .
look ! he &apos;s getting into the car with her .
that doesn &apos;t mean anything .
oh , yeah ? well , let &apos;s see .
okay , duck down .
hello ?
hi , chandler . it &apos;s phoebe .
i know that monica is working today ..
so i was wondering if you wanted to come to the movies with me and rachel .
oh , i have to work too . yeah , i &apos;m stuck here at the office all day .
well , it &apos;s a shame that you &apos;ll miss the movie ..
because we were gonna see , you know , either liar liar ..
or betrayal or an affair to remember .
those are all really old .
okay , then maybe it &apos;ll be ..
dude , where &apos;s my car ?
what ?
they &apos;re in a car .
okay . well , talk to you later , okay ? bye .
okay , quick . we gotta find a cab and follow them .
yeah , okay . let me just grab my night @-@ vision goggles and my stun gun .
i got them .
hey .
hey . hi , sweetie .
hey , you smell like perfume and cigarettes .
i was in the car with nancy .
nancy doesn &apos;t smoke .
well , at least the perfume &apos;s not mine . be thankful for that .
so .. what did you think of the house ?
it &apos;s everything we &apos;ve been looking for .
isn &apos;t it ? and what about the amazing wanes coating ..
the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic ?
and the wiggle woms and the zip zorps !
what were the things you said ?
don &apos;t you love the huge yard ?
the fireplace in the bedroom .
and nancy said it &apos;s really underpriced ..
because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents !
this is bringing out a lovely color in you .
so do you think we should get it ?
i don &apos;t know . what do you think ?
i think we should .
i do too .
this is huge . how bad do you wanna smoke right now ?
i don &apos;t know what you mean , giant , talking cigarette .
phoebe called as i was getting into nancy &apos;s car .
if she asks you , i was at work all day .
got you . when do we tell them ?
we don &apos;t . not until it &apos;s 100 percent . why upset everybody over nothing ?
okay . right .
oh , my god , that is gonna be so hard .
i know . good luck with it .
i just can &apos;t see chandler cheating .
i &apos;m telling you guys , we followed them out to a house in westchester .
they went in for 45 minutes , and then they came out looking pretty happy .
chandler ?
forty @-@ five minutes ?
well , something &apos;s not right .
so you went all the way to westchester , waited 45 minutes ..
and came back in a cab ?
yeah .
if each of you guys would like to pitch in 100 bucks , that would be great .
i can &apos;t believe he &apos;d do this to monica .
i know , and with the baby coming ?
so should we tell her ?
i don &apos;t know .
if one of us saw mike with another woman , would you want us to tell you ?
why ? who &apos;d you see him with ?
no one . i &apos;m just saying if we did ..
tell me what you know !
no one ! nothing ! mike &apos;s a great guy ! it was hypothetical !
all right . he is a good guy .
you &apos;re right . he wouldn &apos;t cheat .
if i did see him with someone , there &apos;s no way i ..
who did you see him with ?
oh , look at her . so happy .
if only there were a smaller one to clean this one .
hey , is chandler here ?
no , he &apos;s picking up dinner . why ? what &apos;s up ?
look , whatever happens , we &apos;re here for you , and we love you .
all right .
chandler might be having an affair .
what ?
phoebe and i saw chandler ..
with a blond woman today outside on the street .
and then we followed them to a house in westchester .
they went in together . i &apos;m so sorry .
oh , my god . oh , my god , that &apos;s awful .
what did you think of the house ?
what ?
monica , you understand what we &apos;re saying , right ?
yeah . sure . i mean , i &apos;m devastated , obviously .
did you think the neighborhood was homey ?
hey .
you son of a bitch .
is it me , or have the greetings gone downhill around here ?
phoebe and rachel saw you with nancy today .
they think you &apos;re having an affair .
who &apos;s nancy ?
what &apos;s going on ?
okay ..
all right , you better sit down .
this is .. this is pretty big .
yeah .
i &apos;m not having an affair .
nancy is our realtor .
i knew he couldn &apos;t be with a woman for 45 minutes !
why do you have a realtor ?
she &apos;s been showing us houses outside of the city .
what ?
are you serious ?
when we found out that we were gonna get this baby ..
chandler and i decided we didn &apos;t want to raise a kid in the city .
so you &apos;re .. so you &apos;re gonna move ?
oh , my god .
shouldn &apos;t we all vote on stuff like this ?
what is wrong with raising a kid in the city ?
i &apos;m doing it . ross is doing it .
sarah jessica parker is doing it !
and that &apos;s great for you guys , but we want a lawn and a swing set .
a street where our kids can ride their bikes ..
and maybe an ice @-@ cream truck can go by .
so you want to buy a house in the &apos; 50s .
have you thought about what you &apos;re giving up ?
you can &apos;t move out of the city . what if .. ?
what if you want chinese food at 5 a.m. ?
or a fake rolex that breaks as soon as it rains ?
or an asian hooker sent right to your door ?
you know what ? if you want to look for a house , that &apos;s okay .
no ! no , it &apos;s not ! don &apos;t listen to him . i &apos;m gonna thump you .
it &apos;s okay , because they have to get it out of their system .
okay ? but you &apos;re gonna realize this is the only place you want to be .
actually ..
we already found a house we love .
what ?
about an hour ago , we made an offer .
bet you wish i was having an affair now , huh ?
you put an offer on a house ?
it &apos;s so sweet .
it really is . it has this big yard that leads down to this stream .
and then there &apos;s these old maple trees .
oh , again with the nature . what are you , beavers ?
look , i know this is really hard , and we &apos;re really sorry .
is this because i come over here without knocking and eat your food ?
because i can stop doing that .
i really , really think i can .
you know that &apos;s not the reason , joe .
i think if you saw it , you &apos;d understand .
you guys were there . it &apos;s beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah , it is .
what the hell are you doing ?
well , it is , all right ? when we were out there today , all i kept thinking was :
&quot; i can &apos;t believe chandler &apos;s screwing this woman ..
but , man , this would be a nice place to live ! &quot;
yeah , but so is this .
yeah . i mean , if you move there , you have to leave here .
i mean , how can you leave this place ?
come on , daddy , listen !
all my life , everyone &apos;s always told me , &quot; you &apos;re a shoe ! &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re a shoe ! you &apos;re a shoe . you &apos;re a shoe ! &quot;
i stopped and said , &quot; what if i don &apos;t want to be a shoe ?
what if i want to be a purse ?
or a hat ? &quot;
i don &apos;t want you to buy me a hat , i ..
it &apos;s a metaphor , daddy !
you can see where he &apos;d have trouble .
well , maybe i &apos;ll just stay here with monica .
i guess we &apos;ve established she &apos;s staying with monica .
your money &apos;s mine , greene .
your fly &apos;s open , geller .
you know what i just realized ?
&quot; joker &quot; is &quot; poker &quot; with a &quot; j &quot; !
coincidence ?
that &apos;s &quot; joincidence &quot; with a &quot; c &quot; !
look ! ugly naked guy lit a bunch of candles .
that had to hurt !
hey , it &apos;s your thanksgiving too .
instead of watching football , you could help .
we know .
rachel , you want to put the marshmallows in concentric circles .
no , mon . you want to put them in concentric circles .
i want to do this .
every year .
it &apos;s stuck !
step .
how did it get on ?
i put it on to scare chandler .
oh , my god ! monica &apos;s going to totally freak out !
plus , it smells really bad in here .
of course it smells bad . you have your head up a turkey &apos;s ass .
monica .
did you get the turkey .. ?
oh , my god !
who is that ?
it &apos;s joey .
i got it !
if we win , they have to get rid of the rooster .
that &apos;s interesting !
if you win ..
we give up the bird .
but if we win ..
we get your apartment .

what ?
&quot; monica &apos;s nickname when she was a hockey goalie ? &quot;
big fat goalie .
correct !
&quot; rachel claims it &apos;s her favorite movie . &quot;
dangerous liaisons .
&quot; her actual favorite movie is .. ? &quot;
weekend at bernie &apos;s .
&quot; monica categorizes her towels . how many categories are there ? &quot;
everyday use .
fancy .
guest .
fancy guest .
two seconds .
eleven ?
unbelievable ! eleven is correct .
&quot; chandler was how old when he first touched a girl &apos;s breast ? &quot;
14 ?
no , 19 .
thanks , man .
&quot; joey had an imaginary childhood friend .
his name was .. ? &quot;
maurice !
&quot; his profession was .. ? &quot;
space cowboy !
&quot; what is chandler bing &apos;s job ? &quot;
ten seconds . you need this or you lose .
something to do with transponding .
he &apos;s a transponster !
that &apos;s not even a word !
you are mean boys who are just being mean !
don &apos;t get mad ! no one forced you to raise the stakes .
that is not true ! she forced me !
you got the question wrong .
it was a stupid , unfair question !
don &apos;t blame the questions !
stop yelling in our apartment ! you are ruining moving day for us .
chandler !
i saw what you were doing in the window !
i saw what you &apos;re doing to my sister ! get out here !
listen , we had a good run .
what was it ? four , five months ?
that &apos;s more than most people have in a lifetime . goodbye .
hey , ross . what &apos;s up , bro ?
what the hell are you doing ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i think ross knows about me and monica .
dude , he &apos;s right there .
i thought you were my best friend ! this is my sister !
my best friend and my sister ! i cannot believe this !
we &apos;re not just messing around . i love her .
i &apos;m in love with her .
i &apos;m so sorry that you had to find out this way .
i &apos;m sorry , but it &apos;s true . i love him too .
my best friend and my sister !
i cannot believe this !
this is the last box of your clothes .
i &apos;m just gonna label it &quot; what were you thinking ? &quot;
i was gonna go across the hall and write that on chandler .
guys , i don &apos;t wanna make things worse , but ..
i don &apos;t want to live with rachel anymore .
you &apos;re so mean to each other .
i don &apos;t wanna end up like that with rachel . i still like you .
that &apos;s fine because i &apos;m not moving .
phoebe , you gotta take her .
i said some bad stuff ..
but rachel has qualities that make her a good roommate .
she gets tons of catalogs and folds down the pages of things i &apos;d like .
what else ?
when i take a shower ..
she leaves me notes on the mirror .
i do . i do do that .
that &apos;s nice . i like having things to read in the bathroom .
when i fall asleep on the couch ..
she covers me with a blanket .
well , you know , i don &apos;t want you to be cold .
and when i told her that i was gonna move in with chandler ..
she was really supportive .
you were so great .
you made it so easy .
and now you have to leave .
and i have to live with a boy !
she really left .
i know .
thank you .
no problem , roomie .
can i ask you a question ?
sure .
what the hell is that dog doing here ?
a little toast here . ding , ding !
this isn &apos;t exactly the kind of thanksgiving you planned ..
but for me this has been really great .
i think because it didn &apos;t involve divorce ..
or projectile vomiting .
if you had gone to vail ..
or if you had been with your family , or if you didn &apos;t have ..
syphilis and stuff ..
we wouldn &apos;t be all together .
so i guess what i &apos;m trying to say is ..
that i &apos;m very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked .
that &apos;s so sweet !
thank you .
here &apos;s to a lousy christmas !
and a crappy new year !
hear , hear !
hear , hear !
you can &apos;t move . you just .. you just can &apos;t .
rachel &apos;s right . this is where you guys belong .
you don &apos;t wanna live in westchester . that &apos;s the worst of the chesters .
you know , sometimes when i &apos;m alone in my apartment , i look over here ..
and you guys are just having dinner ..
or watching tv or something ..
but it makes me feel better .
and now when i look over , who am i gonna see ?
the gottliebs ? the yangs ?
they don &apos;t make me feel so good .
yeah . so don &apos;t move , okay ? just stay here ..
and maybe close your blinds at night .
hey .
hello ?
it &apos;s nancy . they responded to our offer .
and ?
okay . thanks .
they passed .
they said they won &apos;t go a penny under the asking price .
we can &apos;t afford that .
i know .
well , there you go .
i &apos;m really sorry , you guys .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry too . i &apos;m even more sorry that phone call didn &apos;t come ..
before i told you about looking through the window .
yeah . well , we &apos;re gonna let you be alone .
you gonna be okay ?
yeah , we &apos;ll be okay .
love you guys .
you know , i &apos;m really sorry i wasn &apos;t more supportive before .
that &apos;s okay . we understand .
yeah , and about this nancy ..
if you &apos;re not sleeping with her , should i ?
i know there &apos;ll be other houses , but i just ..
i love that one so much .
yeah .
