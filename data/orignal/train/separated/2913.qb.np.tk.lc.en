listen , sir , for the last time , i don &apos;t care what the computer says .
we did not take a bag of mashuga nuts from the minibar .
and we did not watch dr. do @-@ me @-@ a @-@ little .
joey , were you in our room last night ?
no .
i was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill .
we &apos;re checking out of the bridal suite .
that &apos;s right , i &apos;m no longer a bride .
i &apos;ll never be a bride again . now i &apos;m just someone &apos;s wife .
and i &apos;m the happiest guy in the world .
honey , don &apos;t be upset . we still have so much to look forward to .
yeah , right .
we got the honeymoon .
that &apos;s not till thursday .
the wedding pictures .
it won &apos;t be ready for weeks .
not the disposable cameras from the tables .
that &apos;s true . i knew i married you for a reason !
tell you what , i will go get them developed , and you can go home .
what ? what did you take a picture of ?
nothing .
it was something .
ross has the cameras . has he checked out yet ?
are you joking ? checkout is not till noon .
and he has a good 11 minutes left .
so ?
so ross had never checked out of a room a minute before he had to .
one time , when we were dating , we got a late checkout .
he got so excited , it was the best sex we ever had .
until he screamed out &quot; radisson &quot; at the end .
okay , well , i &apos;m gonna get ross , get the cameras and get them developed .
32 , joe . you &apos;re 32 !
here &apos;s a copy of your bill .
thanks .
champagne , strawberries ..
oh , my god ! i can &apos;t believe chandler ordered porn on our wedding night .
yeah , that &apos;s sad . mashuga nut ?
the.one.with.the.red.sweater
i have six minutes left !
it &apos;s me .
soaps , shampoos . are you really taking all this stuff ?
why not ? it &apos;s built into the price of the room .
yeah , but you don &apos;t need .. what is this ?
thread .
score !
where are the disposable cameras ?
what cameras ?
last night i asked you to take them .
no , you didn &apos;t .
yes , remember ? right before we cut the cake , i said ..
yeah , you asked me if i could do you a favor .
then my uncle murray came up to you and handed you a check .
then you said , &quot; why is it called a check ? why not a yugoslavian ? &quot;
then you did that , and my uncle murray looked at me like :
so you don &apos;t have the cameras ?
no , sorry .
so , what ? they &apos;re gone ? monica &apos;s gonna freak !
i &apos;m sure they &apos;re here somewhere . i &apos;ll help you look .
great .
in three minutes .
are you gonna open the presents without chandler ?
no ! i &apos;m just ..
they &apos;re calling out to me . this little guy even crawled up in my lap .
chandler wouldn &apos;t mind if i opened just one present . what do you think it is ?
a little mirror that , when you look into it ..
you see yourself as an old woman .
a tiny salt shaker !
oh , my god , for tiny salt !
oh , wow ! okay . well , that was fun . that was fun .
okay , i &apos;ll just wait for chandler to open up the rest of them .
although , you know , this is part of a salt @-@ and @-@ pepper set .
it may just count as only half a present . what do you think ?
i guess it &apos;s okay to open one more if it &apos;s part of a set . it &apos;s probably this one .
or this one !
how are you ? got any morning sickness ?
the guys don &apos;t know yet , do they ?
joey and ross don &apos;t know anything . chandler thinks phoebe &apos;s pregnant .
that &apos;s right . chandler does still think i &apos;m pregnant .
he hasn &apos;t asked me how i &apos;m feeling or offered to carry my bags .
i feel bad for the woman who ends up with him .
after you , of course .
don &apos;t worry . you only have to be pregnant for a few more hours ..
because i &apos;m telling the father today .
is it someone in the building ? that tall guy on the first floor ?
no !
what ? i think he &apos;s cute .
then you have his baby .
believe me , i &apos;m trying .
it &apos;s so weird . you &apos;re gonna tell this guy today ..
and he has no idea what &apos;s gonna happen .
you &apos;re just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever .
you &apos;re like ed mcmahon , except without the big check .
or the raw sexual magnetism .
yeah , well , i guess it is pretty big news .
pretty big ? it &apos;s huge ! god , this guy doesn &apos;t have a clue .
he &apos;s just walking down the street thinking , &quot; i had sex with rachel greene . i rock ! &quot;
then , bam ! he &apos;s a father , everything &apos;s different .
it &apos;s only different if he wants it to be . i &apos;m not gonna ask him for anything .
he still has this huge decision to make .
now he &apos;s walking around thinking , &quot; do i want to be a dad ? &quot; then , bam !
what was that &quot; bam &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know . he &apos;s hit by a bus , or something .
joey , what would you do if someone you slept with told you she was pregnant ?
who called here ?
did she sound blond ? did she have an accent ? i gotta make a call .
should have never walked into that sunglass hut !
it &apos;s not you ! you didn &apos;t get anybody pregnant .
why would you scare me like that ? what the hell &apos;s going on ?
is somebody pregnant ?
oh , yeah ! that &apos;s me .
oh , my god , pheebs ! you &apos;re gonna have a baby ?
yes , i am . oh , my god , i &apos;m gonna have a baby !
wait a minute , who &apos;s the father ?
you don &apos;t know him .
it &apos;s not important . he wants nothing to do with me or the baby .
who is this guy ? because i will track him down and kick his ass !
david linn .
david linn !
who &apos;s david linn ?
some guy from my gym . little annoying .
chandler ?
did you find the cameras ?
no . did you ?
yes .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m under the table , celebrating .
i checked in the lost and found . i talked to the manager . no one &apos;s turned them in .
great . those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer monica up today .
you just got married . why is she so depressed ?
all my energy is going into not asking that question .
i can &apos;t believe i screwed this up !
i &apos;m sorry , man .
here &apos;s a thought . this is the same ballroom .
there &apos;s a band . there &apos;s gonna be plenty of dressed @-@ up people .
are you suggesting we dance our troubles away ?
no , i &apos;m saying we buy more of these at the gift shop ..
throw our tuxes back on and take a few pictures .
we just have to make sure not to get anybody &apos;s faces .
are you serious ?
i &apos;m thinking about your new bride at home .
do you want to start your life together by letting her down ?
marriage advice ? really ?
i &apos;m telling you , this looks exactly like your wedding .
aren &apos;t these the same flowers ?
i don &apos;t know . monica picked them .
what about the chairs ?
those too .
the place settings ?
her .
what did you do ?
i was in charge of the cameras .
gift shop ?
did you do it yet ?
not yet .
then what are you doing here ? are you about to do it ?
is it gunther ?
it &apos;s not gunther !
thank god . because that hair on a baby ?
the father is not here , okay ? i haven &apos;t told him yet .
i don &apos;t think i can tell him at all now .
why not ?
i was walking down the street , thinking , &quot; i &apos;m gonna tell the father . &quot; and then , bam !
bus ?
no , you ! you freaked me out . you kept saying how huge this all is .
but it is huge .
i know . but i was just thinking about how huge it was for me .
i didn &apos;t even go to how huge it &apos;ll be for the father .
you &apos;re thinking about this way too much . just tell him and get it over with .
it &apos;s like ripping off this band @-@ aid , quick and painless . watch .
oh , mother of .. !
see ?
are we opening presents ?
no . i shouldn &apos;t have even opened these .
joey , i am out of control ! you have to do me a favor .
no matter what i say , no matter what i do ..
please , do not let me open another present . okay ?
give me one more .
oh , good , you &apos;re here . pheebs ? listen ..
sit down , i got something i wanna say .
all right .
it &apos;s a scary world out there , especially for a single mom .
i &apos;ve always felt that you and i have a special bond .
so ..
phoebe buffay , will you marry me ?
oh , my god !
oh , yeah , i &apos;ll marry you .
you can &apos;t marry him !
hey , lady , your day &apos;s over . it &apos;s my turn .
why can &apos;t she marry me ?
i can and i will .
she &apos;s not pregnant . rachel &apos;s the one who &apos;s pregnant .
oh , my god !
he &apos;d notice when you didn &apos;t have a baby in nine months !
it &apos;s joey !
i love you .
wait , i can &apos;t believe it ! rachel &apos;s pregnant ? who &apos;s the father ?
we don &apos;t know .
i wonder if it &apos;s that dude .
there &apos;s a dude ?
who is it ?
about a month ago this guy spent the night with rachel .
i didn &apos;t see who it was , but ..
was that story over ?
the guy left this .
oh , my god ! i know who the father is .
people have got to finish their stories .
hello .
i don &apos;t know if we &apos;re both in . come closer .
nice aftershave .
if you want some , i &apos;ve got eight mini bottles in my bag .
excuse me , could you take a picture of us ?
of course .
would you take one of us ?
yeah , sure .
click .
it didn &apos;t click .
i heard it .
but there was no flash .
why won &apos;t you take our picture ?
oh , yeah . i &apos;ll take your picture .
your finger was covering the lens .
who are you , ansel adams ? get out of here !
look , i feel really bad about how i freaked you out before ..
so i asked the father to meet you here so you could tell him .
what ? wait a minute . how do you even know who the father is ?
i may play the fool at times ..
but i &apos;m more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won &apos;t quit .
i believe this belongs to the father of your baby ..
oh , god . he &apos;s in there right now ?
you can turn around , or you can go rip the band @-@ aid off . what do you want to do ?
let &apos;s rip .
are you sure ?
phoebe !
okay . sorry .
hey , rach .
why don &apos;t you go up on @-@ stage . i &apos;ll get a picture of you doing the speech .

could i get anyone a coffee ?
or poison ? no ? just for me ? okay .
what &apos;s going on , rach ?
nothing . phoebe kind of made a mistake .
but you do wear that sweater a lot . are you involved in some kind of dare ?
i &apos;m actually glad phoebe called .
i know we broke up because you thought i was immature , but i &apos;ve grown up .
i think we should get back together .

it is the right time . i &apos;m ready for more .
come on , rach . let &apos;s give it another try .
i &apos;m having a baby .

chandler &apos;s never gonna trust me with anything ever again .

tag is not the father . and joey knows now ?
i do , rach , i do . and i am so happy for you .
wow , you didn &apos;t even try to unhook my bra .
so are you ever gonna tell whoever it is ?
i will . i &apos;m just not up for it tonight .
no matter what this guy says , you &apos;re not gonna be alone in this .
i &apos;m not ?
