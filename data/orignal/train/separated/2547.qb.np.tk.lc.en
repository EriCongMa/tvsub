第二十七季 第九集
oh , are we gonna stay
roto @-@ rootered like this the whole show ?
it &apos;s rotoscoped , dad .
whatever it is , it &apos;s making me sick .
a noble experiment that failed .
why is the sky blue ?
i don &apos;t know . just is .
why are clouds white ?
no clue .
why are people yellow ?
it &apos;s the way god made them .
why is grass green ?
so you can find your damn golf ball .
now i have a question for you .
why did you leave your toy car on the stairs ?
why is blood red ?
why do you ask ?
it &apos;s coming out your ear .
so you &apos;ll be staying with grampa
while your father is on the mend .
don &apos;t let him near me !
do it again , boy .
i bet he can &apos;t control it .
bart , you shouldn &apos;t ...
maybe one more .
want to play cars ?
oh , boy , if i go down there , i ain &apos;t coming up .
my dad won &apos;t play cars with me , either .
calm down , melvin q. mopenheimer .
there &apos;s other ways of playing cars .
feast your eyes on the most beautiful machine ever made :
the 1954 studebaker starliner commander !
i bought it brand @-@ new
and forgot about it till today .
can i sit in it ?
well , i don &apos;t know how you expect to drive it
if you ain &apos;t sitting in it .
grampa ! i can &apos;t drive .
neither can i , legally .
now let &apos;s get going !
you know you can season these things
with pepper spray , don &apos;t you ?
i need water in my eyes .
let &apos;s open her up a little .
homer never showed such spirit .
you got gumption , boy .
i wish this day would never end .
aw , sorry , bart.
time don &apos;t stop .
the years go by
and you don &apos;t even realize it .
grampa , i told you to get him home by 5 : 00 .
his tutor &apos;s here to teach him to read .
when i was a boy ,
i ain &apos;t never did not need no tutor either no how !
yes , sirree , ain &apos;t !
&quot; s @-@ see ... the ...
&quot; see the mouse .
&quot; mouse hits cat .
cat goes splat . &quot;
very good , lisa .
very , very good !
and with barely any knowledge of diphthongs ,
sibilants and phonemes .
how come she can read and i can &apos;t ?
all right , calm down , young man .
not to worry , you won &apos;t need to read .
you see , customers will just point to a picture
of the burger that they want you to flip .
because you &apos;re not gonna have anything going .
very nice painting , lisa .
we &apos;re putting it right over the couch .
i made a drawing , too !
it &apos;s on the refrigerator !
and the wall .
and the curtains .
boy , you &apos;ve ruined our kitchen !
do you understand ?
this is a place of pork chops .
but ... do you like my drawing ?
homer , please , please .
just say something positive .
well , it &apos;s a ...
colorful example of ...
something that ...
ruined our kitchen !
i can &apos;t even find the fridge !
you &apos;re not beer .
where is it ?
and who are you ?
we &apos;re playing hide and seek .
i &apos;m milhouse .
milhouse ? what kind of a wiener name is that ?
a very bad one , sir .
that boy is so much trouble .
never should have had a firstborn .
should &apos;ve skipped right to the second .
there &apos;s one thing i can do better than you .
i &apos;ve finished painting the wall
and it &apos;s better than new .
in some ways , this was kind of a bless ...
i got gumption !
bart &apos;s disruptive behavior
is probably caused by his feeling
that you think other children
are more deserving of attention .
mm , i see .
and how can we help these other children ?
we &apos;re here for bart.
in a boy like bart ...
yeah ?
... the attention he craves most is from his father .
good luck with that .
take him camping !
i do want to help him , i do .
and your son is just looking for your love .
for a psychologist ,
you sure know how to get into people &apos;s heads .
and i brought my flashlight
so we can find our way in the dark ,
and my scissors to cut wood into kindling ,
and an air horn to scare away bears .
不加热泳池
wh ... why are we stopping ?
this is where we &apos;re camping , son .
i thought we were going to stay
in a tent in the woods .
like the kids that got killed
in that movie you took me to .
son , the woods this time of year are very outdoorsy .
but we &apos;ll do fun things .
oh , listen ! do you hear that ?
it &apos;s the sound of an ice machine .
great .
come on , let &apos;s go hunt ...
for the registration desk .
andreychuk passes ahead to hamilton ...
it &apos;s too far in front ...
and the ref waves off the icing .
the tv is north of the bed .
better hit the hay , son .
learning this new remote
really took something out of me .
never saw a menu button colored green before .
crazy buttons .
so , how was
your camping trip with your father ?
okay .
we got lots of starwood points at the hotel .
oh , my thrifty pioneers .
lisa , how was school ?
the teacher gave me this .
&quot; student of the month &quot; !
how long have you been in that school ?
a month .
i &apos;ve been there two years
and no one ever gave me anything !
aw , poor kid .
are you taking his dessert ?
yes , i am .
up to him .
are you eating that cake ?
what ? no .
son , i know it may not seem like it now ,
but you &apos;re gonna be glad
to have a sister when you grow up .
you &apos;re always gonna like her better than me .
that &apos;s not true .
i love you both the same amount : 40 % .
gotta leave room in the budget .
then will you put this on your car ?
i &apos;ll be proud to .
ooh , both those bumper stickers mean so much to me .
happy birthday !
well , thanks .
but you know i &apos;m not into krusty anymore .
you &apos;ve outgrown krusty ?
first no more &quot; ay , caramba , &quot; now this ?
mom , don &apos;t have ...
have a cow , man ?
i was gonna say
&quot; don &apos;t have a foolish attachment to the past . &quot;
come on , boy .
humor your mother .
oh , fine .
don &apos;t have a cow . man .
oh , my god !
i &apos;m student of the month for 48 consecutive months !
great , honey , great !
but , you know , it is bart &apos;s birthday .
no , no , no , this is fine .
just let me fix this .
there .
now it &apos;s all about you .
happy ?
i &apos;ll go get him .
oh , it &apos;s no use .
he &apos;s walking kind of fast .
hey , you missed one .
nope , can &apos;t do it , my grampa lives there .
stop ! stop right there !
well , looks like we finally put an end
to this light @-@ mare on elm street .
actually , it &apos;s maple street , chief .
thank you , joke police .
please don &apos;t arrest me .
it &apos;s a victimless crime !
oh , i can &apos;t see !
looks like a case of molemanslaughter .
did that sound right to you , lou ?
i like it .
thanks for letting me hide here , grampa .
hiding ?
this is the best visit i &apos;ve had in months !
now , come get your birthday present .
i &apos;ve been asking my parents for this ,
but they said i &apos;d break my neck .
hey , you &apos;re gonna break your neck sometime .
it &apos;s important you do it when you &apos;re young .
like chicken pox .
now get out before i say something else preposterous .
mom , it &apos;s just the mayo clinic pre @-@ medical summer camp .
i would &apos;ve been totally fine on my own .
no more discussion .
our cab &apos;s here .
ooh , it &apos;s one of those new apple cars .
really think they should &apos;ve stuck with computers .
have a great trip .
don &apos;t you worry .
i &apos;ll take good care of our little guy .
i &apos;m 15 !
oh , our big boy &apos;s getting cranky .
homer , this summer may be your last chance
to have a close relationship with your son .
don &apos;t blow it .
so , boy , look at this .
just us guys , huh ?
glad we &apos;ve got the whole summer ,
&apos;cause we got a lot to talk about .
yeah , i guess .
let &apos;s see .
when you replace windshield wipers ,
you only need to switch out the rubber part ,
not the whole blade .
huh , where can you buy just the rubber part ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , i &apos;m glad i told you that before i died .
so , uh , i &apos;ll go to moe &apos;s while you sort it out , huh ?
yes !
hey , thanks for coming .
after washing dishes for a year they bumped me to prep ,
which means i draw up the schedule , babe .
wow , no more mr. minimum wage .
i didn &apos;t say that .
so i just got out of juvie for the streetlight thing .
but i &apos;m not mad .
i &apos;ve learned that the greatest crime of all
is a life without faith .
what &apos;s wrong ?
is the cross not big enough ? !
wow , you make out just like terri said you do .
wait , you &apos;re not terri ?
no , i &apos;m sherri .
but the further we go ,
the more you &apos;ll know the difference .
oh , weed .
that can get me into a lot of trouble .
hey , idiots , the bong stays in the tree house !
hey , boy .
are you crazy ?
what if the cops come ?
you &apos;re here , too ?
yeah , must be weird for you .
and @-@ and think about this , man--
the whole world is happening right now .
i mean , india , china .
it &apos;s crazy .
can you just leave me here with my dad ?
all right , sure .
i can fly !
no , no , i can &apos;t !
i can &apos;t !
dad , why is it you and i are never on the same page ?
officer down , man .
boy , when you arrived , i was terrified .
because it meant i wasn &apos;t a kid anymore .
i had responsibilities .
truth is , i &apos;m just like you .
a misunderstood guy who wants his family to love him .
and maybe we could start with a hug ?
aw , i &apos;m so glad we &apos;re sharing this .
and i &apos;m glad i have one kid who &apos;s never
gonna go anywhere or do anything .
damn it , homer !
you ruin everything !
grampa , got to talk to grampa .
挚爱的父亲和嘟囔鬼
grampa , i sure miss you , man .
what would you say if you were here right now ?
if you ever get a chance to pitch woo at myrna loy , take it !
she has eyes like a persian cat .
of course in my day , persia extended
from algiers to constantinople .
till the revolt of the eunuchs in 1916 when ...
ooh , you got gumption , kid .
find what you love and follow it to glory .
yes .
so , we &apos;re headed into the final round
of the duff extreme bmx vert competition .
let &apos;s check the scoreboard
while the half @-@ pipe is being cleaned by the blood @-@ zoni .
dad , one more round and i win !
first achievement i can call my own .
thank god whatever this thing is
is considered a sport .
bart simpson to the gate , please .
oh , good , we &apos;re just in time .
it &apos;s not the size of the pennant .
it &apos;s what you do with it .
all right , nobody likes a showoff .
oh , man , i love to see this .
simpson &apos;s setting up for his signature
suicide no @-@ hander 540 crank @-@ flip !

so i don &apos;t have to remember two lies .
bart !
i was getting worried .
i &apos;m your oldest buddy .
i was there when you got your nose done ,
then i was there when you had your nose undone .
friends , family , and a few people we hired
to make our son look more popular ...
i love milton !
dad , you &apos;re embarrassing me !
as usual .
yes , it &apos;s the only thing your father does well .
can &apos;t you two put it aside for one night in honor of me ?
no !
ah , what the heck ?
congratulations , milhouse .
you made it through adolescence and you &apos;re cuter than ever .
oh , sweet lisa !
you know i had a rocky childhood
with all the rocks they threw at me .
you &apos;re the most amazing thing at this party .
well , excuse me !
i &apos;m not even the best simpson at my best friend &apos;s party !
do you know what it &apos;s like to be second @-@ best at anything ?
yeah , i do !
i &apos;m going to yale !
listen here , bart simpson !
i am sick and tired of you blaming me
for every setback you have ever had !
and you have talents , too , you idiot .
you &apos;re a hell of an artist ,
even though you don &apos;t do anything with it .
you think i &apos;m an artist ?
and you already have a true artist &apos;s most important asset .
a miserable life .
so if that &apos;s all my fault , you &apos;re welcome .
hey , man . you &apos;re looking good .
thank god lisa invented the artificial pituitary .
sorry , didn &apos;t mean to use the &quot; l &quot; word .
listen , man , a certain someone convinced me
to go around giving back the lunch money i took .
here &apos;s the first $ 5,000 .
thanks . what got into you ?
nelson , come on !
we &apos;ll miss day six of the bolivian film festival .
you guys are dating ?
is there any other reason i &apos;d be going
to a bolivian film festival ?
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t tell you , bart.
i don &apos;t really know how you feel about me .
well , you told me i was an artist , and you were right .
i am , and
i get to write on the walls .
wow , that &apos;s beautiful .
i do notice there &apos;s no me .
ah , those are the breaks .

that would be nice .
we &apos;ll see you at the car .
you weren &apos;t supposed to see .
well , i &apos;m glad i did .
you &apos;re el barto ?
how is that possible ?
why are clouds brown ?
pollution .
why is the grass green ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s artificial .
then why are the sprinklers coming on ?
&apos;cause i was too lazy to unhook them .
why aren &apos;t we moving ?
because you &apos;re drunk and i &apos;m stoned .
why does beer taste so good ?
&apos;cause you &apos;ve just had seven .
did you like the movie boyhood ?
oh , is that what this was ?
how many years of hair do i have left ?
it disappears as soon as girls like you .
what &apos;s the secret of life ?
you can avoid a lot of awkward situations
by pretending to be on the phone .
like what ?
hold on , i got to take this call .
