第六季 第二集
how are you ?
i &apos;m good .
you &apos;ve got five minutes .
i tried to cancel the deena gross meeting , but she insisted .
yeah , she &apos;ll be nervous .
just tell her they arrested me , because ...
you &apos;re working too hard for your clients ? i did .
she still wants to talk .
fine . bring carey zepps into the meeting .
she feels more comfortable with men in charge .
i &apos;m trying to call neil gross ...
n @-@ n @-@ no , no . don &apos;t do that . this is all about his wife .
she &apos;s still house counsel for chumhum ,
so he &apos;s giving her the authority over the antitrust case .
the class action ?
right .
some of the coders claim
there was a conspiracy between chumhum and some of the other tech firms
to hold down salaries and stop poaching employees .
well , i ran through the files ,
and they don &apos;t want to go to trial .
that &apos;s right .
they feel betrayed by their own coders for suing them .
so they want to make an example of them .
so , scare them off in depositions .
yes .
if we don &apos;t shut this down , they will leave us .
that &apos;s why deena was meeting with lockhart / gardner .
does she know that diane is coming with us ?
what ?
does mrs. gross know
that diane lockhart is leaving lockhart / gardner and joining us ?
i didn &apos;t know she was coming to us .
cary .
what ?
i &apos;m a named partner , alicia ,
you can &apos;t decide this without me .
we have to move forward .
and i have no idea when you &apos;re gonna get out of here .
i &apos;ll be out in 24 hours .
and we will lose diane if we don &apos;t decide now .
so , the equity partners already voted to bring her in ?
we haven &apos;t gotten that far , yet .
cary , we don &apos;t have a lot of time .
will it matter to chumhum
if they know diane is coming with us ?
it &apos;ll matter to neil gross .
it won &apos;t matter to deena .
and don &apos;t call her mrs. gross .
she goes by her maiden name , lampard .
that &apos;s it . stand up .
uh , what about the deposition strategy ?
i &apos;ll be out before then .
in case you &apos;re not .
hands behind your back .
why ? what &apos;s going on ?
cary , the depositions . what &apos;s the strategy ?
it &apos;s too hard to go after all 38 coders .
look at my files .
i focused my fire on the senior coder , gus pawlicky .
your honor , he has spent five days in jail .
yeah , because he &apos;s charged
with conspiracy to transport heroin .
no , because the asa is trying to punish him .
we have supplied the court with his bail .
and we have asked for a source of funds hearing .
the burden of proof is reversed here , your honor .
the defense must show that the bail money is legitimate
and does not come from drug proceeds .
and that is why i have submitted
this affidavit from dexter roja .
the bail money comes from his business not ...
mr. roja , who is intimately connected
with lemond bishop , a top drug dealer .
just allow me to question mr. bishop . that &apos;s all i ask .
and what is the harm in that ,
mrs. lockhart ?
the harm ...
excuse me , i need both of you to step back behind the bar .
the harm is that this is a trojan horse hearing .
the asa does not care about the source of funds .
he wants to question mr. bishop under oath about his business .
which the defense only fears because mr. bishop will withdraw
his illegal funds if threatened with questioning .
and yet , i &apos;m perusing an affidavit here
swearing to the fact that these funds are legally obtained .
so , why doesn &apos;t that suffice ?
i believe it is a lie .
okay , so what now ?
let me call a witness ,
a hostile witness , who i think
will tell the truth no matter what .
who ?
alicia florrick .
can she hurt us ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe .
well , we have another problem .
oh , good . more .
i know what evidence they have against you .
okay . what ?
a wire .
that &apos;s good .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t tell bishop &apos;s crew how to break the law .
what ?
you did .
no , i didn &apos;t .
i heard it , cary .
you heard a tape of me telling bishop &apos;s crew
how to smuggle $ 1.3 million in heroin into the country ?
and how to sell it without getting caught .
then it &apos;s a fake .
well , we still have options ...
well , wait a minute ,
i didn &apos;t do this .
and i don &apos;t know what you heard , kalinda ,
but i was asked questions by three crew members in bishop &apos;s crew ,
and i made it very clear
that i couldn &apos;t advise them on anything .
but you answered their questions ?
only their hypothetical questions .
was the tape edited ?
possibly .
well then we need the testimony of the three crew members .
only those three can contradict the wire .
only those two .
one of them was wearing the wire .
thank you for meeting us here .
we just want you to know , mrs. gross ...
ms. lampard .
right . uh , we just want you to know
that cary was targeted
by the asa &apos;s office because he &apos;s so effective for his clients .
that still doesn &apos;t do me much good if he &apos;s in jail .
that &apos;s why alicia and i are handling the deposition prep .
carey , could you take deena through our strategy ?
mr. bishop . hello . do we have an appointment ?
no .
just mrs. florrick , please .
you need an office with a door .
yes , we &apos;re putting one in .
i understand you &apos;re testifying today about the bail money .
yes , diane just called me .
i want you to know something ...
if they make me testify , the bail money goes away .
do you understand ?
b @-@ but hasn &apos;t your state had more murders per capita
than any other state , mr. governor ?
well , i think our state has the same gun problems
of any large state .
i do think we try harder to enforce our gun laws .
crime will be his undoing , eli .
you sound like a republican , ms. jarrett .
mm , i sound like a voter .
a voter ?
yeah . yeah , a voter .
oh . how &apos;s washington , voter ?
oh , eli . are you still pouting ?
why would i be pouting ?
oh , because you didn &apos;t hire me at the white house
after expressly promising to do so .
i didn &apos;t promise a thing . that was all in your head .
but what about your wife ?
what are her views on gun laws ?
well , the last thing i want to do is to speak for my wife .
well , she has represented some pretty hardened criminals , hasn &apos;t she ?
yes , that &apos;s because she &apos;s a good lawyer .
she represents the sinners and the saints , but ...
&quot; sinners and saints , &quot; is that you ?
i never sign my canvases .
when are you heading back to d.c. ?
monday . why ?
your into women running for office , aren &apos;t you ?
what do you need , eli ?
i need you to help convince a woman to run .
who ?
norah o &apos;donnell .
no .
alicia florrick .
case number 14cr3866 .
good afternoon , mrs. florrick .
mr. polmar .
who supplied the $ 1.3 million for cary agos &apos; bail ?
dexter roja , one of our clients .
and he &apos;s a businessman ?
yes .
and a very generous businessman , by the look of things .
i can &apos;t speak to that .
well , you have to be pretty generous
to give $ 1.3 million to someone that you hardly know .
objection . was that a question ?
let me rephrase .
you have to be pretty generous
to give $ 1.3 million to someone that you hardly know ?
it would be inaccurate to say
that dexter roja hardly knows cary .
hmm , i see .
how many times has mr. roja met cary in person ?
i &apos;m not sure .
more than three times ?
objection , mrs. florrick has already stated
that she is not sure .
yeah , i &apos;ll withdraw .
is it your understanding
that mr. roja &apos;s money came from his health club business ?
that is correct , mr. polmar .
isn &apos;t mr. roja a long @-@ time associate of lemond bishop ?
objection , your honor-- vague .
what is vague ?
&quot; long time &quot; or &quot; associate &quot; ?
both .
no , uh , i find them both clear . overruled .
yes , mr. roja , at one time , worked for mr. bishop .
in his ... drug empire .
objection-- not in evidence .
sustained .
mrs. florrick ,
when mr. roja gave you this money ,
was mr. bishop present ?
yes .
he was there ? mr. bishop was there ?
yes , but on another matter .
uh , does the asa have any more questions ?
yes , i do .
mrs. florrick ,
could you please tell me ...
could you please tell me what this is ?
it appears to be a master membership roster
of mr. roja &apos;s health clubs .
yes , it is . thank you .
quite a few members .
i believe it does very well .
oh , very well .
could you also tell me what this is , please ?
the death certificate inventory
from the county medical examiner .
yes , it is . thank you again .
it is a list of people who have died in the last two years .
could you compare the highlighted names there
with the membership roster from the health clubs ?
your honor , what does this have to do
with our source of funds hearing ?
dexter roja &apos;s bail money came from his business .
20 percent of his business came from people who are dead .
all right , let me see that .
his business is a sham .
it is a cover for laundering mr. bishop &apos;s drug proceeds .
and if i were allowed ...
if i were allowed to question mr. bishop ,
then this would become evid ...
your honor , you have already quashed mr. bishop &apos;s subpoena .
yes , but we would suggest
that mrs. florrick &apos;s testimony has opened that question again .
your honor , there is nothing new here .
no , uh , actually there is .
okay , i &apos;m gonna allow mr. bishop to be subpoenaed .
thank you , your honor .
thank you , thank you .
it feels good to be home after the wilds of new york .
and , uh , you were all missed out there .
well , maybe not you , david .
thank you , dean .
good to finally have you near .
which brings us to our last item of business today . diane .
yes .
after founding this firm 13 years ago ,
and seeing it turn from a small corporate nonentity
to one of the two top law firms in chicago ,
i find that it &apos;s time to ...
it &apos;s time for me to resign .
diane .
thank you , but i &apos;ve given this , um ,
a lot of thought .
i am married now , and i ...
diane has graciously agreed to hand over
the managing partner reigns to mr. canning ,
who is unfortunately out sick today .
but let &apos;s give a round of applause to diane lockhart .
okay , what &apos;s going on ?
what do you mean ?
diane , you recruited me .
i &apos;m here because of you .
and now you resign ?
hold the elevator ?
i &apos;m going to florrick @-@ agos .
you &apos;re kidding me .
in a week . no one knows i &apos;m going .
no one at lockhart / gardner .
what about your clients ?
alicia florrick is meeting
with them individually to encourage them to follow me .
i can &apos;t do that .
i have a fiduciary responsibility to lockhart / gardner .
diane , this is crazy .
you &apos;re leaving the biggest firm in chicago for a start @-@ up ?
yes .
come with me .
it &apos;s a good firm , dean .
go to florrick @-@ agos and see for yourself .
bishop withdrew the bail money .
i &apos;m gonna spend a year in here waiting for trial .
i still have other options .
i &apos;m looking into a second mortgage on my apartment .
alicia , you can &apos;t do that .
i can . i &apos;m meeting today .
it &apos;s very generous , but seriously .
stop it . you would do the same thing .
you have to take the deposition today .
i &apos;ll reschedule .
you can &apos;t .
deena will take her business to lockhart / gardner .
bring carey zepps into the depo and have him whisper
in your ear every now and then for effect .
who &apos;s on the other side ?
lorainne joy , clements &amp; holloway .
you &apos;re kidding .
what ?
why ?
alicia , how are you ?
i &apos;m good , lorainne . how are you ?
good , good , good .
i &apos;m excited about facing off finally .
i hope that all is forgiven about me not hiring you .
but look at you now .
what a perfectly adorable office .
should we get started ?
the first deposition is gus pawlicky .
he &apos;s their top coder .
he &apos;s the linchinpin ?
yeah .
the rest of the class action crumbles if you destroy him .
and how long have you worked at chumhum , mr. pawlicky ?
i @-@ i was fired .
but seven years total .
until you discovered this chumhum price @-@ fixing .
ms. joy , do you mind ?
chumhum had a handshake deal
with other social networking companies .
a week later , i was fired .
i &apos;m whispering something that looks important
so deena thinks i &apos;m in control .
thank you , carey .
do you need a minute with alicia to help her ?
his lawyer will try and shut you down ,
but start in with questions about his drinking .
my drinking ?
yes . you were pulled over on the afternoon of may 19 ?
yes , i @-@ i was upset .
that was the day i found out about the agreement .
the price @-@ fixing agreement .
so , because of that discovery , you decided to get drunk ?
i had a @-@ a couple of beers at lunch .
and that &apos;s all .
you received a negative
performance evaluation in the previous week .
your supervisor wrote that he smelled alcohol
on your breath .
that &apos;s a lie .
that was , uh , a fluoride rinse .
and three other negative evaluations
in the months prior to your being let go .
repeated lateness , failure to accomplish assigned tasks ...
th @-@ they planted those and they backdated them .
did they also backdate this accusation of your sexting ?
what ?
that was a @-@ a prank .
alicia .
i think your partner wants to confer with you .
no , we &apos;re good .
let &apos;s go through these sexts one at a time .
i told you .
i don &apos;t want you investigating my crew .
this isn &apos;t an investigation , mr. bishop .
i just need to get statements from three of your crew .
that &apos;s all . it &apos;s to back up cary &apos;s vers ...
foul !
that was a foul , ref !
i heard there was a tape .
you know anything about it ?
no .
if someone in my crew is betraying me , i need to ...
go , dylan !
you got it !
go , go , go !
nice try , dylan .
keep your head up , buddy .
if someone &apos;s wearing a wire , i need to know .
me knowing helps you and your lawyer .
i wish i knew more , sir , but , uh , i &apos;m in the dark .
okay .
you can question my three guys .
good .
i have time this afternoon at 5 : 00 .
actually , you don &apos;t need to be there , mr. bishop .
actually , i do .
we need to talk settlement .
all right .
but you have to raise the amount .
i can &apos;t take that to my client .
we &apos;ll go as high as $ 4 million .
for mr. pawlicky ?
no .
the whole class .
i &apos;ll talk to my clients .
alicia , there &apos;s an avery miller @-@ siegel on line one .
who ?
oh , the bank .
mr. miller @-@ siegel , it &apos;s alicia florrick .
it &apos;s missus , actually .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s loud in here .
mrs. florrick , i am happy to inform you
that certified national bank has approved
your second mortgage loan .
oh , good !
great . how quickly can we close ?
as soon as tomorrow , if you &apos;d like .
i &apos;ll messenger over the documents for you and your husband to sign .
okay , i &apos;ll be ...
uh , my husband ?
well , yes , the apartment is co @-@ owned by your husband .
isn &apos;t that right ?
um , well , yes , technically .
but he @-@ he isn &apos;t a full @-@ time occupant .
yes , that doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;ll still need his signature , too ,
given he &apos;s listed as a co @-@ tenant .
alicia , valerie jarrett &apos;s on line three .
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
a valerie jarrett is on line three for you .
mrs. florrick ?
um , i &apos;m sorry , can you hold for one second ?
certainly .
valerie jarrett at the white house valerie jarrett ?
she didn &apos;t say . you want me to ask ?
no . w @-@ what &apos;s it regarding ?
i have no idea , she just asked to speak to you .
mr .... mrs. miller , uh , siegel ,
can i call you back in a second ?
i &apos;ll be here until 5 : 00 .
thank you .
hello ? this is alicia florrick .
yes , alicia . it &apos;s valerie jarrett .
how are you doing today ?
i &apos;m ... good .
listen , i just wanted to call and tell you
that i have been an admirer of yours for many years now .
you @-@ you have ?
yes , yes-- the way you started your own business , and ...
what does this say ? what does it say ?
&quot; stuck by your husband . &quot;
i am not saying that .
and i admire the way you &apos;ve set your own course .
uh , well , thank you ,
ms. jarrett . have @-@ have we met before , or ... ?
no , we haven &apos;t , but i heard
that you were contemplating running for state &apos;s attorney .
what ?
she &apos;ll know it &apos;s me !
what do you want me to say ?
just encouragements , encouragements .
and i wanted to encourage you to run .
the only way women are gonna change the world
is if they step up .
ms. jarrett , may i ask ,
how did you hear i was contemplating running ?
how ? um , the grapevine .
um , see , the thing is , ms. jarrett ,
the grapevine ?
my husband &apos;s chief of staff , eli gold ,
he &apos;s the only one contemplating me running .
actually , it &apos;s the furthest thing from my mind .
well , why is that , alicia ?
why ? because i hate politics .
i do , too , alicia .
the last person i &apos;d vote for is someone who liked politics .
we have enough politicians .
we need leaders who actually understand
what it means to be a public servant .
listen , i &apos;ve got to go .
promise me you &apos;ll think about it ?
i will .
thank you for calling , ms. jarrett .
what &apos;d she want ?
she wanted me to run .
run where ?
i have no idea .
may i help you ?
uh , yeah , is this florrick @-@ agos &amp; associates ?
it is .
we &apos;re in the midst of remodeling-- pardon our dust !
uh , is alicia florrick here , please ?
uh , no . she just stepped out .
okay , mr. agos ?
well , no . sorry .
do you have any sense when he &apos;ll be back ?
five to ten .
oh , that &apos;s a joke . i really can &apos;t say .
are you looking for representation ?
robyn , the water &apos;s cold .
yeah , i know . they turned off the hot water
for just an hour .
are you kidding ?
i know , gunter . we &apos;re all making do !
oh , that &apos;s gunter .
we let him use the sink in the afternoon .
so , you &apos;re looking for a lawyer ?
i @-@ i was .
oh , no , no , no , no . we &apos;re a good firm .
we &apos;re like a funky coffeehouse ,
with all the great used couches .
and we make the best coffee .
i &apos;ll get a lawyer for you .
what the hell , diane ?
so , cary did not advise you to break the law ?
we were telling stories , that &apos;s all .
stories that had no basis in truth ?
look , all we were saying is that
if people did the stuff that they saw in the movies ,
we &apos;d all be in jail .
and cary was saying what would be good advice for those people .
that &apos;s all .
the people in the movies ?
mm @-@ hmm . like-- if the guy in the movie did this or that ,
then he wouldn &apos;t get caught .
exactly .
we weren &apos;t talking about anything real .
we &apos;re not that stupid .
so you can all substantiate
that cary was speaking in hypotheticals only ?
that &apos;s right .
hypotheticals only .
the one with the silver teeth .
jim lenard .
he &apos;ll make a good witness-- he &apos;s likable .
so is trey .
trey was the one wearing the wire .
you said you didn &apos;t know who was wearing the wire .
i didn &apos;t , until today .
his voice was the loudest
on the tape-- microphone was on him . it &apos;s trey .
didn &apos;t you say that
he &apos;s bishop &apos;s top man ?
yeah .
and we can &apos;t tell bishop , or he &apos;ll have him killed .
i can &apos;t sign this .
yes , you can .
this is money for cary &apos;s bail ?
money that will come back to me .
after the trial .
peter , it &apos;s a formality .
the apartment &apos;s mine .
yes . and i &apos;m the governor of illinois .
if i sign off on a loan for bail
for an accused drug dealer ...
cary &apos;s not an ...
it &apos;s not about what he is ; it &apos;s about what it looks like .
no one &apos;s ever gonna know .
until they do .
you should know this better than anyone .
documents don &apos;t go away .
your signature doesn &apos;t go away .
you &apos;re punishing me .
what ?
for how things have unfolded
these last few months , you and me .
you want to be angry at me , be angry at me ,
but don &apos;t punish cary !
okay , okay .
it was good seeing you .
you &apos;re going ?
i can &apos;t sign off on your loan .
and neither should you .
it &apos;s just not a smart move .
maybe i just wanted to believe you &apos;d do the right thing .
because the man i married would have .
well , that &apos;s interesting .
because the woman i married never would have asked .
so ... do we have a deal ?
no . actually ,
i think we should continue with our depositions .
really ?
who should we depose ?
her .
that &apos;s not a law firm .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s a frat house .
they have some issues .
no , no , no , no .
issues ... issues can be solved .
i &apos;m talking about structural oddities .
i mean , the inmates are running the asylum .
alicia &apos;s been distracted .
by the fact that her partner &apos;s in jail .
look ,
they &apos;re rough around the edges
because they &apos;re just starting up .
but start @-@ ups have their advantages .
i mean , don &apos;t you feel stifled here ?
i mean , wouldn &apos;t you love an opportunity
to build a firm the way you want ?
not if it looks like that .
forget what florrick @-@ agos looks like now .
what can it turn into ?
i mean , a firm with a mission , with a real ...
minority initiative ,
with woman and people of color in authority .
all you &apos;re seeing are ... are roadblocks .
see an opportunity to build our future
exactly how we want it to be .
poaching was and is
a problem in the tech industry , yes .
you invest time and money in an employee ,
only to see them leave .
yes , but if you &apos;re asking if chumhum
had a secret agreement with other companies
to hold down salaries
or to clamp down on poaching ,
no , absolutely not .
okay . can you tell me what that is , please ?
uh , it &apos;s a copy of an e @-@ mail .
from patric edelstein , ceo of sleuthway , to you .
can you read it ?
may i ...
may i see a copy , please ?
certainly . here you go , alicia .
ms. lampard ,
if you wouldn &apos;t mind ?
&quot; about the agreement we discussed ... i &apos;m in .
sick of losing all my best people to you .
xx . patric . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry , what does this prove ?
mr. edelstein sent her a vague e @-@ mail .
yes , but ms. lampard forwarded the e @-@ mail
to her director of human resources .
can you tell me what that is there
in the text of this forwarding e @-@ mail , ms. lampard ?
that ? a smiley face .
an emoticon-- signifying your satisfaction
at having reached an agreement
with mr. edelstein .
not necessarily .
isn &apos;t it true , ms. lampard ,
that many communications in the tech industry
contain emoticons ?
no .
hmm . then maybe you can explain these .
smiley faces ,
winkies ...
bronx cheers .
in every case , the emoticons illustrate
your feelings about a proposed deal .
we &apos;re gonna have to leave it there--
i &apos;m being called away .
oh , really ? how convenient for you .
our life has become more interesting
since cary was arrested .
who is he ?
no idea , but he has money .
mrs. florrick , hi .
ernie nolan , erco properties .
we met once at a fund @-@ raiser
for your husband .
oh , yes , of course .
one of my clients has an office in your building .
it &apos;s a lovely space .
thank you , thank you .
and may i say that your offices are lovely , also .
well , we are a , um ...
work in progress .
so , how can i help you today , mr. nolan ?
well , actually ,
maybe we can speak alone ?
actually , robyn is my most valued confidant ,
so ... no .
okay .
i &apos;ve heard about your partner &apos;s troubles .
uh , curtis agos .
cary agos .
i want to loan the funds
for his bail , interest @-@ free .
you ...
why would you do that , mr. nolan ?
i think it &apos;s disgraceful how the current state &apos;s attorney
is behaving-- he &apos;s railroading your partner .
so here &apos;s a cashier &apos;s check for $ 1.3 million .
take it .
i &apos;m still confused .
how well do you know my husband ?
how well ? mm , not very .
why ?
did my husband ask you to do this ?
no .
then i &apos;m confused .
i &apos;m not a fan ...
of the current state &apos;s attorney , ma &apos;am .
the way he &apos;s been treating your partner ,
it &apos;s the same way he &apos;s been treating
the hardworking businessmen of chicago .
and we need a change .
i &apos;m not running for state &apos;s attorney , mr. nolan .
i know . but when you do announce ...
i &apos;m not announcing .
i &apos;m never running .
ever . i &apos;m not a politician .
right . exactly .
it was very nice to meet you .
and you . we &apos;ll be in touch .
no , we won &apos;t .
here you go .
i &apos;m ...
trying to be a friend , mrs. florrick .
i know .
i have plenty of friends ; i don &apos;t need any more .
you taking money from roderick realty ?
have a nice day .
a @-@ am i a bad person ?
i mean , take the money .
take the check .
no . it &apos;s not free .
what do you care ? he thinks you &apos;re running
for state &apos;s attorney , but you &apos;re not .
so take the check . you told him
you &apos;re not running-- it &apos;s not corrupt .
but he &apos;ll expect a quid pro quo .
so ? there isn &apos;t one .
unless you secretly want to run .
what ?
the only reason to reject that check is
if you think it &apos;ll hurt your campaign .
there is no campaign .
i know , so take the check .
are you going to get it ?
don &apos;t ever use surrogates on me , eli .
valerie jarrett , she doesn &apos;t just make it up
in her mind to suggest i run .
you put her up to it . i &apos;m not running .
i have no interest in running .
there &apos;s no wrong i want corrected .
there &apos;s no mountain i want to climb .
that ...
so stop getting people to call me
and come to me with money--
i &apos;m not changing my mind .
what ?
i &apos;m ...
not ... changing ... my mind .
and if i took that money ,
it &apos;s corrupt !
wait . what money ?
ernie nolan &apos;s money !
ernie nolan from erco properties ...
he offered you money ?
eli , stop it .
i didn &apos;t talk to him . i didn &apos;t say anything .
i &apos;m ... not ... running .
wow . that &apos;s interesting .
something odd .
i just saw diane lockhart &apos;s preliminary witnesses
for the cary agos trial .
they listed two of the crew members
who were with agos , not all three .
who was the one they left off ?
trey .
our c.i. ? the one wearing the wire .
yep .
how did they know ?
i have no idea .
dean . hello .
is everything all right ?
i &apos;d like to speak to you about florrick @-@ agos .
i thought about what you said-- building from the ground up ,
starting new .
all my life , i &apos;ve pursued the sure thing ,
the predictably obtainable .
so it frightened me to think about going after something new .
it also excited me .
you &apos;re coming ?
yes .
i &apos;m so glad , dean .
it &apos;s not just me .
they &apos;re coming , too .
you &apos;re kidding .
wait . what ?
cohen and faber from corporate transactional ,
kay sargeant from tax ,
kevin meyers from m &amp; a , and christie
and berger from trusts and estates .
six department heads ?
two of them david lee proteges .
well , uh , where are we gonna put them all ?
well , that &apos;s a pretty high @-@ class problem .
would you excuse us ?
patric edelstein , ceo of sleuthway .
and an innocent man .
thank you , mr. edelstein , for answering questions .
no problem .
it helps that you &apos;re suing me , too .
in your capacity as ceo ,
did you give a presentation
at the beaver creek tech conference last fall ?
i did .
ms. lampard
approached you afterwards , didn &apos;t she ?
she did . she said she was in complete agreement that costs
were spiraling out of control .
and did she propose a solution ?
she suggested a deal ,
that sleuthway and chumhum would agree to hold the line
on salaries and agree not
to poach one another &apos;s key people .
really ?
and what did you say ?
initially i agreed ,
but , i have to be honest , i never intended
to honor the agreement and i never did .
ms. lampard can be ... challenging to deal with .
so i just told her what she wanted to hear .
but ms. lampard was serious about this deal ,
wasn &apos;t she ?
it certainly seemed so to me .
we have a problem .
what kind of a problem ?
jim lenard .
oh , bishop &apos;s man . the one with the silver teeth ?
yeah .
and ?
he &apos;s dead .
what ?
a @-@ any sense why ?
bishop . he thought lenard was the c.i.
damn .
yep .
he just killed one of cary &apos;s two witnesses .
mm . hello ?
yes , mrs. florrick , it &apos;s linda keating
from the weekly correspondent .
yes ?
i just wondered if you had a quick reaction
to the push poll script that was leaked this morning .
excuse me ? it &apos;s 7 : 00 a.m.
yes , i know . i need some quotes for our online edition .
do you have any reaction to the push poll about your candidacy ?
my ... i don &apos;t have a candidacy .
is that a quote ?
i know . i got the same call .
it wasn &apos;t me , alicia .
eli .
why would i leak a push poll like that ?
have you read it ?
who else , eli ?
who else would poll on my candidacy ?
castro . right now he &apos;s a shoe @-@ in for reelection .
he &apos;s worried about you .
i don &apos;t believe you .
have you read the polling questions ?
they make you look bad .
&quot; do you think the wife of a sitting governor
should take advantage of her position to run for office ? &quot;
this is castro , not me . don &apos;t you see ?
and i had nothing to do
with ernie nolan offering you money .
he did it on his own .
yes , i got valerie jarrett to call you ,
but that was it . this is just happening .
nothing just happens .
yes , it does .
as cynical as i am ,
i know that sometimes the world just takes over .
people write letters , kids stand in front of tanks ,
college students vote .
and even this crook , nolan--
that &apos;s a good sign .
i never trust when the good guys support you .
it &apos;s when the bad guys come round , you know it &apos;s real .
people think you &apos;re important enough to bribe .
did the reporter tell you he polling results ?
i don &apos;t want to know .
it backfired for castro .
74 % viewed your candidacy in a positive light ,
even with his wording .
stop , eli .
peter would kill for those numbers .
any politician would .
mrs. florrick .
it &apos;s always a pleasure .
although if this is about your partner &apos;s prosecution ,
you &apos;ll have to speak with finn .
i &apos;m not running , mr. castro .
okay . i don &apos;t know where that came from
but good to know .
every dollar you spend polling on me
is a waste of a dollar . i &apos;m not running .
i assure you , i had nothing to do
with that poll that was leaked to the paper this morning .
i &apos;m far too focused on my own campaign to worry about yours .
there &apos;s no &quot; mine . &quot; i &apos;m not running .
good .
it wouldn &apos;t make much sense .
running while your partner is going to jail for dealing .
i &apos;m not a threat to you .
oh , i know .
you may be polling at 74 % , but wait till they find out
what your firm &apos;s been up to .
i &apos;m not running .
good .
then we have no disagreement .
why are you going after cary ?
drugs .
why do you think ?
eli , did you see this ?
&quot; do you think a prominent politician &apos;s wife
with no political credentials should run for office ? &quot;
the push poll . i know .
it sounds bad . but look at the results .
get castro on the line .
why ?
because i &apos;m gonna tell him if he keeps up with this crap ,
we &apos;re getting involved .
it wasn &apos;t castro .
it wasn &apos;t ? well , who was it ?
okay , first of all , alicia should run . she just ...
stop .
you &apos;re kidding .
she wasn &apos;t listening to surrogates .
i needed to create enemy surrogates .
okay . do what you have to do .
but don &apos;t do this .
you don &apos;t like deena lampard , do you ,
mr. edelstein ?
yes , i do .
in your last deposition ,
you said she was ... difficult to handle .
yeah , but i meant in business .
you don &apos;t hold a personal grudge against her ?
i &apos;m not sure . what do you mean ?
you and ms. lampard used to date , didn &apos;t you ?
i need a moment with my lawyers .
i never gave you permission to go down this route ,
mrs. florrick .
what do you think neil gross would hate more ?
finding out that you and edelstein dated
or losing this lawsuit ?
we used to date , a few years ago .
until your archrival , neil gross , stole her away from you .
i wouldn &apos;t characterize it that way .
you two were supposed to go away together to belize , weren &apos;t you ?
here is an affidavit from a ...
beaver creek participant
who said that you referred to deena as a lying bitch .
i might have been ... inelegant ,
but i thought her price @-@ fixing scheme was ridiculous .
so ridiculous , in fact , that you didn &apos;t think
she would hold up her side of the bargain .
i mean , she was ... she was always flying off the handle , saying things .
so if you didn &apos;t believe
that deena would do what she said ,
then there was no agreement , was there ?
what ? what do you mean ?
an agreement requires an offer and an acceptance to be valid .
if you and the other ceos didn &apos;t believe
that deena would follow through with her end of the deal ,
then there was never a valid acceptance .
well , i mean ...
actually , i can &apos;t be so certain
what deena would do or not .
let &apos;s discuss .
$ 5 million .
four .
they conspired to hold the line on employee &apos;s pay .
they fired anyone who objected .
prove it .
$ 4.5 .
no . four .
i should &apos;ve hired you .
you &apos;re an assassin .
your mistake .
he &apos;s dead ?
yeah .
bishop &apos;s tying up loose ends .
he thought his enemy was jim , but it wasn &apos;t .
cary , we &apos;ll do our best ,
but the loss of this witness hurts .
have you talked to bishop ?
about ?
make sure he doesn &apos;t kill the other good witness ?
yes .
jim lenard was the best witness for cary we had .
the one whose testimony was most likely
to be favorable to us in court .
you &apos;re saying he wasn &apos;t the one wearing the wire ?
no .
i &apos;m saying that we can &apos;t lose another witness .
okay .
then tell me who cary needs .
you don &apos;t want both witnesses to be unavailable ,
then tell me who cary needs .
all those in favor .
cary , what &apos;s your vote ?
nay .
that is ...
ten yeas and five nays .
the motion passes .
we are now florrick , agos &amp; lockhart .
and we &apos;re no longer in debt .
this is the cook county jail &apos;s automated phone system .
you have exceeded the allotted time ...
we have one new item of business .
chumhum has agreed to an advance on our fees .
it was cary &apos;s case .
i move that we use it to get him out on bail .
i second .
well , you can &apos;t second . you &apos;re not a partner .
i urge someone else to second .
i second .
all those in favor ?
agos , get up .
you made bail .
good @-@ bye .
how you doing today , gunter ?
that depends .
do you have hot water ?
i think so .
then i &apos;m good .
what about you ?
i don &apos;t know .
the future &apos;s weird .
9 / 11 was a plot .
you look thin .
yeah . diet . fresh air .
a lot of changes around here .
yeah .
we missed you .
this is the first time we &apos;ve done this , isn &apos;t it ?
i think so .
