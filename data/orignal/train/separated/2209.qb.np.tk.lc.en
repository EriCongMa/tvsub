happy thanksgiving !
aunt deb ?
so i went to the doctor
and they ran a whole bunch of tests , and , um ...
i have a tumor in my brain .
aunt deb , she &apos;s sick .
it &apos;s inoperable ,
but she &apos;s refusing any other kind of treatment .
i guess that &apos;s her choice , right ?
well , yeah , it &apos;s her choice , but here &apos;s the thing .
i mean , it &apos;s not just her who &apos;s gonna be affected by this .
aunt deb practically raised my sister mary .
we &apos;re gonna get through this .
you know that ?
listen , i &apos;m so glad
you decided to fight back , deb .
you can thank leonard for that .
leonard popped the question
and i said yes !
who here presents this lovely bride
to be married to this man ?
i do .
you may kiss the bride .
i remember everything about that day .
i was wearing this wedding dress .
the trade winds had settled ,
and there wasn &apos;t a cloud in sight .
the ocean was as blue as the sky .
it was magnificent .
but compared to you ...
you were standing there in your tuxedo ,
so ... so handsome , so dapper .
you called me your angel .
your one in a million .
i had never been so happy .
i miss you , darling .
take care of my leonard .
yes , ma &apos;am .
when we were boys , we had to learn that sacred chant
by heart and understand its meaning .
by the end of this weekend ,
i expect all you boys to know it , too .
all right , bring it in .
all right , bring it in .
all right .
pass that around .
i want all of your electronic devices ,
anything that connects you to the outside world--
your cell phones ,
tablets , your fitness bands .
oh , man .
i wasn &apos;t kidding
when i told you that for the next couple of days ,
we are going back to the old ways .
that includes the dick tracy watch , liani .
thank you . thank you .
okay .
each of you is being given a pahi .
now , the blade is sharp , okay , so be careful .
and while we &apos;re setting up camp ,
each of you boys is going to head into the jungle
and find a koa tree .
now , using your pahi ,
you &apos;re gonna cut off a fresh branch
and carve your own ihe .
when you &apos;re done ,
it should look something like this .
now , to pass the first test of your ho &apos;ike ,
you &apos;re gonna have to dodge a barrage of these
that i &apos;m gonna throw at you .
relax . tips will be covered . you &apos;ll be fine .
all right , any questions ?
when do we get our phones back ?
any other questions ?
good . all right , you have two hours
to gather your wood .
how are we supposed to know what time it is ?
you took all our stuff .
the same way your ancestors did . use the sun .
and if you can &apos;t , just start counting .
now go .
it &apos;s gonna be a long weekend .
still got it .
what the hell ?
did you hear that ?
please ! somebody help !
please ! help me !
somebody help ! i need help !
please ! help me . i need help .
my boy . he &apos;s been shot .
he &apos;s all i &apos;ve got .
please , don &apos;t let him die .
please don &apos;t @-@ don &apos;t let him die !
please don &apos;t let him die .
he &apos;s all i ...
he &apos;s my only son .
he &apos;s all i have .
please don &apos;t let him die . please don &apos;t ...
please don &apos;t let him die .
well , that happened .
oh , we had way too much fun .
and way too many mai tais .
how did we end up here ?
well , i believe it started
when you insisted on walking me to my room .
this is it ?
this is it .
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
a gentleman always walks a lady to the door .
well ...
you know , i think all that rum may have clouded your memory .
all right .
all right , have a good night .
hey . a gentleman walks a lady to the door .
okay .
okay . good night .
that is so not what happened .
well , you know , this hotel has security cameras
in all the hallways .
i could just go pull the footage .
okay .
why don &apos;t you go do that .
and i &apos;m gonna take a shower .
unless you want to join me .
i could look at that footage anytime .
‭ no .
lieutenant kelly .
yeah . no , no . i know where it is .
uh , yeah , i &apos;ll pick her up on the way .
liani &apos;s father was back at camp .
he heard the gunshots , and he ran into the jungle
and found his son lying here
with two gunshot wounds to the chest .
no sign of a shooter .
all right , well , the kid is still in surgery .
according to the nurse , in addition to the injuries
that he got from the bullets ,
he also sustained several fractures
consistent with a very serious fall .
hey , that &apos;s a koa tree .
it &apos;s the wood that liani would &apos;ve needed
to carve his spear .
okay .
so he got shot up there ,
and either he fell over the side or he got thrown off .
look . looks like he cut a path through here on his way up .
okay . kono and i will go up and take a look .
okay . we &apos;ll go talk to the other kids ,
see if they saw anything .
okay .
hey , you think they &apos;re , uh ...
knocking &apos; em ? oh , yeah .
footprints .
i got gravitational blood drops .
this is definitely our crime scene .
okay .
i got a second set of footprints .
tire tracks .
kono .
these drag marks are fresh .
this door has been opened recently .
what the hell is this place ?
during world war ii , the u.s. military
had munitions bunkers all over the island .
yeah ?
well , i don &apos;t think this was one of &apos; em .
that flag represents the empire of japan .
after peal harbor , some japanese americans
sympathetic to the emperor
went underground to avoid internment .
this could &apos;ve been a hiding place .
okay . i &apos;ll buy that .
that still doesn &apos;t explain
what our shooter was doing in here .
look-- more footprints .
well , he &apos;s not gonna have any answers for us .
well , judging by the size and density of the radius ,
i &apos;d say these are the remains of a mature adult male .
furthermore , i &apos;d estimate
they &apos;re as old as this rather spacious crypt .
okay , well , without the rest of him ,
i imagine it &apos;s gonna be pretty tough to determine c.o.d.
well , perhaps not .
csu found this
in the soil among the bones .
oh , a slug .
hey , what if the person who shot liani
was in here covering up an old murder ?
yeah , but why now , 75 years after the fact ?
hey , guys .
i got something you need to see .
based on the width of the axle
and the size of the tires ,
i &apos;d say our shooter was driving some sort of cargo van .
once i get these impressions back to the lab ,
i &apos;ll narrow down and make a model , no problem .
but in the meantime , check this out .
the approaching tread impression is shallow ,
the departing is deep .
so the van came up here empty and left full .
best guesstimate , about 2,000 pounds full .
well , this wasn &apos;t about some old bones , then ,
there was something else in that bunker .
all the morning &apos;s yours , aunt deb . what do you want to do ?
what do i want to do ?
i want to drive your truck .
what ?
your pickup truck .
i @-@ i want to take that bad boy for a spin .
oh , my gosh .
do you even know how to drive , aunt aeb ?
honey , i lived in los angeles my whole life .
i was driving before you were in camo diapers .
i @-@ i know , but why the sudden urge to drive a truck ?
well , you know , actually , it &apos;s for leonard .
uh , last year , we got together
and we made up a list of things
that each one of us wanted to do before we died .
like a bucket list ?
yeah .
what was on it ?
well , we wanted to see the pyramids ,
we wanted to learn how to ski , and ...
i wanted to get a tattoo .
oh , don &apos;t get a tattoo .
trust me , it &apos;s not the ...
she got a tattoo ...
it &apos;s too late .
look .
yeah , sorry , kiddos , but the two of you
are not the only ones in the family now with ink .
okay , good . i &apos;m glad you have ink .
so , um , anyway , we never did get to finish the list ,
but one of the items on leonard &apos;s list
was he wanted to drive a police car .
that &apos;s such a boy thing .
‭ so , uh , how many ponies under that hood ?
i &apos;d really ... i &apos;d really prefer you didn &apos;t find out .
steven , i hate to play this card ,
but i just lost my husband ,
so you &apos;re not really gonna deny me this , are you ?
we &apos;re flying !
you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m good .
you look a little green .
no , i &apos;m ... can you please watch the road ?
please keep your eyes on the road .
this is torture for you , isn &apos;t it ?
are you gonna puke ?
puke , puke !
uh , no , jo ... joanie , don &apos;t .
i &apos;m not gonna puke , joanie .
puke , puke , puke , puke , puke ... he &apos;s gonna puke .
i &apos;m not gonna puke !
... puke , puke ...
tell her to be quiet .
you look like you just saw a ghost .
rough commute .
how &apos;s your aunt ?
she &apos;s fine .
she &apos;s , uh ... she &apos;s actually not bad , everything considered .
thanks for asking .
kono filled me in , but what &apos;s the latest ?
well , couple developments .
for starters , ballistics just came in .
yeah , the two slugs pulled out of the kid
and the one found with the bones
were fired from the same weapon .
a japanese nambu pistol .
standard issue for the japanese military during world war @-@ ⅱ .
discontinued , 1945 .
wait a minute , this thing was in the bunker all these years ,
then that kid walks in
and our suspect picks this up and shoots him with it ?
yep . and now he &apos;s fighting for his life at king &apos;s medical .
okay . what else we got ?
check this out .
what was inside ?
cyanide .
cyanide ?
i know , crazy , right ?
the secret bunker , the world war @-@ ⅱ pistol ,
the kill pill in the ring with the hidden compartment ?
i mean , this is some real @-@ deal secret agent stuff .
take it easy .
obviously , we think the remains in the bunker
could &apos;ve been those of a japanese spy .
yeah , max managed to scrape together a dna sample .
we &apos;re hoping japan will help us i.d. it .
yeah , once we figure out who the rotting corpse belongs to ,
it &apos;ll help us figure out who was up there this morning and why .
and what about the rest of the evidence ?
actually , i was just getting to that when you walked in .
now , i can tell you what all this stuff is ,
but i got no idea what any of this means .
this is washi .
a light but durable paper made from the mulberry bush .
definitely of japanese origin .
over here we got canvas bags , some bungee cables .
now , the only thing i can tell you about these items is ,
like the paper , it &apos;s old ,
like , circa 1904s @-@ old .
also made in japan .
i just got a &quot; jerry alert . &quot;
yeah , me too .
same .
yeah , hope you don &apos;t mind ,
i took some initiative. fed your boy ortega some of this intel .
figured it was in his wheelhouse .
beautiful day , isn &apos;t it ?
god , i love the ocean .
it just calms me .
well , actually , it &apos;s overcast today .
not in here . it &apos;s always perfect .
all right , i know it &apos;s not real ,
but i had to do something .
my mother &apos;s basement had more natural light than this place .
plants won &apos;t even grow down here .
i was starting to lose it .
jerry , your text said it was urgent .
you &apos;re not exactly radiating urgency .
okay , gather round and prepare to have your minds blown .
and i &apos;m not just talking figuratively . pun intended here .
okay , jer .
right . so ...
in 1944 , the japanese military
initiated a program called operation fugo .
they used the winter trade winds to launch
thousands of balloon bombs from japan ,
across the pacific , timed to detonate
when they reached the u.s. mainland .
as it happens , these balloons were made of paper .
anybody want to guess which kind ?
uh , washi ?
gold star for you , inspector .
canvas bags filled with sand and bungee cords
were used as part of the ballast to help control the trajectory .
each of these balloons was equipped
with an incendiary explosive device and a 15 @-@ kilogram bomb .
these bombs were designed to fall on populated areas ,
kill civilians and ignite forest fires .
the concept was genius .
but the operation was an epic fail .
well , maybe &apos; cause it sounds like a plan concocted by wile e coyote .
look , if this fugo operation was launched in japan ,
why did we find all the materials in a bunker on oahu ?
here &apos;s why :
my far east sources-- the same ones that helped us
with the chinese satellite situation a couple years back--
tell me that there &apos;s classified intel that in the summer of 1940
the japanese government
was secretly developing fugo here on oahu ,
with a planned launch coinciding with the bombing of pearl harbor .
all the necessary supplies were smuggled in ,
but something happened and it never became operational .
so what you &apos;re saying is you think
that bunker may have been full of bombs .
yeah .
that sounds like something someone might shoot a kid over .
according to eric ,
that van weighed almost a ton when it left the area .
that &apos;s a lot of explosives .
yeah , it is . and after all this time ,
they &apos;re gonna be highly unstable .
which means that detonation-- whether intentional
or otherwise-- in a populated area ...
we &apos;re gonna be looking at a mass body count .
is there anything in this place that is not fried ?
the napkins .
so ... tell me , nicky , how &apos;s the singing racket ?
not bad , but it would be a lot better if i had a partner .
my nephew warned me about this .
don &apos;t think about it . just say yes .
no , i &apos;m afraid not , nicky .
that ship has sailed .
oh , the hell it has .
do you remember thanksgiving a couple years ago ,
you got up on stage , you belted out an irving berlin number ?
you were dynamite .
the club loved you .
that was a nice night , wasn &apos;t it ?
and there &apos;ll be many other nights just like it .
no , i don &apos;t think so .
listen to me , i get your apprehension ,
but just hear me out .
nicky .
renovations on the club ,
they &apos;ll be done in a couple of months .
look , honey ...
the next time you come out ...
honey ... ...
we &apos;ll bang out a couple of duets ...
nicky ...
and you &apos;ll love it .
please .
i &apos;m telling you , you &apos;ll just go cra ...
please .
there &apos;s not gonna be a next time .
how long ?
not long .
nicky , it &apos;s okay . i &apos;ve made peace with it .
did you tell steve and mary ?
no .
and i @-@ i &apos;m not going to , uh ...
when i told them the first time , they were devastated .
especially mary .
i ... i &apos;m not gonna put &apos; em through that again .
is there ... anything that i can do ?
yeah , there is one thing .
name it .
okay . after i &apos;m gone ,
steve is gonna need someone in his life with a little wisdom .
i &apos;ll be there .
actually , i was going to ask if you knew someone .
very funny .
yeah , i know you &apos;re gonna be there for him .
thank you .
you know , your friendship has meant everything to me , nicky .
excuse me .
can i get you anything else ?
oh , yes , anything you haven &apos;t had .
what ? !
come on ! what do you want to do ,
take me with you ?
my arteries are getting hard as we speak .
oh , we haven &apos;t had the jalapeno poppers
or the fried zucchini .
that would be g ... oh , and also ,
would you bring my friend here
some cholesterol medication ?
very well .
cheers .
all right , thanks . that was eric .
the tire treads at the crime scene
belong to a nissan nv1500 .
hpd &apos;s flagged all the plates ,
and duke &apos;s got units going door @-@ to @-@ door .
should be just a matter of time
before we talk to every registered owner .
time is something we don &apos;t have .
all right , who we looking at here ?
so , we got a hit on the dna profile that max sent out .
remains in the bunker belong to 2nd lieutenant aki hiroda--
which is interesting ,
considering that the japanese army lists him as killed
in action in the battle of changsha , china ,
in the spring of 1940 .
so what , they faked his death ?
or they gave him a new life .
the kia story is classic espionage stuff .
they kill hiroda on paper , then they send him out here
to work as an agent with a new identity .
all right , well , there &apos;s no way that
fugo was a one @-@ man operation .
they had to have other players involved .
that &apos;s a safe bet . also safe to assume
that our perp has a close connection with one of them ,
maybe even hiroda himself .
otherwise , how would he know about this secret bunker
and what was inside of it ?
yeah , it would also explain
why they tried to take all the bones--
they didn &apos;t want us getting an i.d.
yeah , and we did get an i.d.--
it &apos;s still gonna be hard to link someone to that bunker .
steve &apos;s right . we &apos;ve also got to find the alias
that hiroda was working under .
i &apos;ll get that .
how ?
it &apos;s not like the japanese consulate &apos;s gonna voluntarily
turn over information regarding an attack on this country .
i &apos;m not gonna ask them .
looks like liani &apos;s gonna be okay .
he was just moved to recovery .
oh , that &apos;s excellent .
yeah . doctors said that
he may be able to be questioned in a few hours .
good .
how are you holding up ?
um ... hanging in there . thanks .
what about adam ?
he &apos;s keeping his head down , doing his time .
you know , so far the other inmates
seem to be giving him plenty of space .
i was worried that he &apos;d be a target in there &apos; cause of me ,
but it looks like being the son of hiro noshimuri
matters a lot more than being married to a cop .
hey , listen , you make sure adam knows
that if he needs anything at all ...
all right ?
thanks .
that &apos;s my guy .
all right , here we go .
hiroda &apos;s spy name was saburo mori .
he came here on a temporary visa
to work the sugar plantations in the summer of 1940 .
except he wasn &apos;t here to harvest sugarcane ;
he was here to stage a terrorist attack .
right . after pearl harbor ,
japanese intelligence assumed he &apos;d been arrested
or rounded up and sent to an internment camp ,
but there was no record of that .
then , after the fall of 1941,
there was no record of him at all .
until this morning .
right .
my contact said that these are all the classified documents
related to operation fugo ,
including names of other agents who were part of the program
when it was here on oahu being developed .
that &apos;s microfilm .
yeah .
i haven &apos;t even seen that stuff since i was in grade school .
wait , can the table read that ?
no , the table can &apos;t read it . we need a projector .
and where do you suppose we &apos;ll get that from ?
i &apos;ll have the projector back before you close . i swear it .
like you brought back the doubt factory and ...
alien agenda : investigating extraterrestrials among us ?
okay , those books were stolen from my basement
by a british terrorist .
along with your tinfoil hat , i &apos;m sure .
look , i get it if you don &apos;t want to do this for me ,
but how about being a good citizen and doing it for five @-@ 0 ?
for $ 63.49 in late fees ,
i &apos;ll be a good citizen .
as we discussed , i &apos;m a little short on cash at the moment .
and i &apos;m short ...
on microfilm projectors .
are you serious ? it &apos;s a dead technology .
who &apos;s using it ?
not you .
all right , lady , i didn &apos;t want to do this ,
but you forced me .
we &apos;re on the verge of a catastrophe of biblical proportions .
dozens of japanese @-@ made bombs
were stolen by some wack job
who already tried to kill a kid this morning .
and without receiving any demands ,
we &apos;re thinking he may just want to blow up the island
with said weapons of mass destruction .
so if you selfishly want to stand in the way
and take on the responsibility of a million lives , be my guest .
hpd sector car patrolling manoa
just went in pursuit of a nissan van .
could be our guy .
stand down . have them stand down .
we don &apos;t have aviation up yet .
let it go . i &apos;m telling you ,
those bombs are already unstable .
a pursuit could trigger a detonation ,
and in that neighborhood ,
there &apos;s gonna be mass casualties .
all right , we stand down , we lose him .
he &apos;s not gonna get far .
let &apos;s just wait till we got those birds in position .
copy that .
duke , terminate the pursuit .
i know , i know , but have all units stand down immediately .
hey , what happened ?
so , as soon as hpd pulled back ,
the driver ditched his van and took off on foot .
as far as we know , the explosives are still inside .
wait a minute , our perp had a clean getaway
and he got out of the van and bailed ?
strange , right ?
we get a description on this guy ?
partial . two witnesses say he &apos;s male ,
he was wearing a hat and sunglasses ,
so he could be anywhere between mid @-@ 20s and late @-@ 40s .
all right , what about the van ?
we know anything about the van ?
it was reported stolen last night .
eod boys are here .
火奴鲁鲁警局
all right , boys , listen up .
anything you don &apos;t like , you get the hell out .
copy that .
she &apos;s all yours , commander .
my man . thank you .
夏威夷群岛
hey , guys ...
i think we found the rest of mr. hiroda .
and this .
that &apos;s a nambu type 14 .
all right , i &apos;ll get it over to eric ,
see if he can pull some prints off of it .
turns out the navy had some intel on our spy .
according to them ,
hiroda , aka saburo mori ,
had a handler here on oahu .
his name was jiro takaki .
he worked at the consul general &apos;s office as a diplomat ,
but after pearl harbor
he was picked up by naval intelligence for questioning .
items we found in your home
directly link you to saburo mori .
we also know mr. mori &apos;s planning
some kind of attack on the u.s. mainland .
now he &apos;s up and vanished .
i &apos;m gonna make this simple , mr. takaki .
i want to know where mr. mori is right now .
i want details on the attack :
time , place and method .
i cannot tell you what i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re playing a dangerous game here , my friend .
i &apos;m giving you a chance to cooperate
and spare yourself a turn in the electric chair .
i swear i &apos;m telling the truth .
i don &apos;t know where mr. mori is ,
and i don &apos;t know operational details .
i help with logistics and money , that &apos;s it .
all i can tell you is mr. mori and i were supposed to meet
at natsunoya teahouse last week .
that &apos;s when he was going to tell me his plan .
but he didn &apos;t show .
who else is involved ?
i want names .
there is no one else .
just mr. mori .
okay , spoiler alert-- takaki &apos;s lying .
according to documents i found on the microfilm ,
there was one other person involved in the plot .
and that &apos;s this guy .
yuri musaka .
he was an officer in the imperial japanese navy
who was sent here around the same time as hiroda .
oh , my god , i can hardly keep up .
okay , so there &apos;s hiroda ...
and now takaki ...
and then here &apos;s musaka .
so that makes it at last three guys
who knew about this bunker and knew the contents inside .
correct .
okay , so we know
that our shooter &apos;s probably connected to one of them ,
and we &apos;re already looking into hiroda .
what else can you tell us about the other two ?
unfortunately , not much .
takaki was sent back to japan after the war in a pow exchange .
he died of cancer two years later .
there &apos;s no surviving family .
how about musaka ?
still looking .
problem is , unlike hiroda , i don &apos;t have his alias--
the legend he used when he first got here .
i &apos;ve been combing through the microfilm ,
but so far i &apos;ve found nothing .
okay , well , keep digging .
let us know when you find something .
roger that .
okay , so , um , okay , me and joanie--
we &apos;ll go get the car , okay ?
you can wait here , all right ?
oh , all right , sweetheart . that sounds good .
all right , i &apos;ll be right back .
oh , mary ?
take your time , sweetheart .
uh , i &apos;ve got something i have to do first .
can i give you those ?
‭ okay . you all right ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine . okay .
are you sure ?
take your time .
all right , i &apos;ll be right back .
thank you .
hello . uh , i &apos;d like to talk to someone
about an asset transfer .
hey , i got your message . you have something for me ?
you know it , lou .
what ?
short for &quot; lieutenant . &quot;
don &apos;t you find that a tad bit confusing ,
considering captain grover &apos;s first name is lou ?
yeah , you might be right .
let &apos;s just stick with lieutenant kelly .
copy that .
what have you got ?
found a fresh print on that old pistol you guys recovered .
pretty good chance it belongs to whomever shot the kid .
ran it through afis , came up snake eyes .
but i did find a different set of prints on the bullets
inside the magazine .
pretty sure these babies were left there over 75 years ago .
i was able to lift them during a process
called cyanoacrylate fuming ,
ironically a technique invented by the japanese .
eric ... did you get a hit ?
indeed i did .
so the prints that eric lifted
came back to this guy .
recognize him ?
yeah , that &apos;s hiroda &apos;s coconspirator ,
yuri musaka .
except when he got to oahu in 1941,
he was using the name youshi tamuro .
now , the only reason his prints are in the system to begin with
is because , from 1942 to 1946,
he was a prisoner at honouliuli internment camp .
and it gets better .
now , musaka ,
still using the name &quot; tamuro , &quot;
stayed on the island even after the war ended .
in 1947 , the guy got married .
in 1949 , he started a construction business .
and then , just three days ago ,
at the age of 100 , he passed away .
so musaka kills his partner in cold blood .
then he stays here living under the radar for 75 years .
and now , after all this time , he dies ,
and somebody goes right to the secret bunker
and cleans it out .
anybody else thinking what i &apos;m thinking ?
yeah , this was never about the bombs .
whoever shot liani went in there
to destroy anything that would tie musaka
to the spy ring or operation fugo .
all right , for all we know ,
they had every intention of discarding those bombs .
i think i may know who that person is .
i looked into musaka &apos;s next of kin .
he &apos;s survived by two daughters ,
both of whom live on the mainland ,
and a grandson who lives here on the island .
his name is kyle tamuro .
and according to his social media ,
he and his grandfather are very close .
chin , ping his phone .
i got him .
where is he ?
he &apos;s in the building .
kyle tamuro .
on your knees right now . put your hands behind your head .
please .
hands behind your head . interlock your fingers .
i didn &apos;t mean for any of this to happen .
i came here to tell you this was all a mistake .
i was in the bunker cleaning out the place .
no one had been there since the war .
i didn &apos;t think anyone else even knew that it existed .
but then i heard a noise .
someone was coming in .
and there wasn &apos;t any other way out .
i was trapped .
look , all i saw was someone holding a knife ,
and i panicked .
look , i &apos;m so sorry .
i was only trying to protect my grandfather &apos;s legacy .
that bunker was hidden for 75 years .
you could have just left it alone .
no , i couldn &apos;t .
i mean , that area is about to be developed .
my family &apos;s company was asked to submit a bid .
when i mentioned it to my grandfather ,
that &apos;s when he revealed the truth .
confessed he had been a spy for the japanese government .
and a killer . let &apos;s not forget that .
it was kill or be killed .
he said , when it came time to do the mission ,
he had a change of heart .
he went to hiroda , tried to get him to stand down ,
but hiroda wouldn &apos;t hear of it .
there was a struggle inside the bunker .
my grandfather had no choice .
he did what he had to do to stay alive .
look , he was a proud man .
he didn &apos;t want anyone to know about his past .
he didn &apos;t want to bring shame on our family .
okay , get up .
how &apos;s the boy ?
he &apos;s all right .
he &apos;s got a long road ahead of him .
please tell his parents i &apos;m very sorry .
hey , jer .
commander .
we , uh ... we closed the case .
you know that , right ?
yeah , chin texted me .
yet you are still going through the old files .
yeah , well , it &apos;s not every day you get to look
at unredacted government files from the &apos; 40s .
oh . this is like christmas morning for you .
it &apos;s better .
hey , uh , jerry ,
you know you &apos;re not gonna find anything on roswell in there , right ?
而整个事件被军方掩盖
‭ course not . don &apos;t be ridiculous .
these are navy files .
air force covered up roswell .
right . uh , okay .
anyway , i just ... i just wanted to come and say good job ,
and , uh , you know ?
good job .
appreciate it .
hey , did you know the naval investigative service
kept musaka under surveillance even after the war was over ?
no , i didn &apos;t know that .
check it out .
obviously , they only knew him as youshi tamuro ,
but they considered him a person of interest .
kept tabs on him for years .
but the guy was a model citizen , put down roots ,
even married a local girl-- olina hoku .
they actually met before pearl harbor ,
but they stayed in touch the entire time
he was in the internment camp .
wait a minute .
she &apos;s the reason he changed his mind .
look , musaka came here for one purpose ,
and that was to do us harm , right ?
then he falls for this girl .
and in the end , his love for her
outweighed his loyalty to his country .
love &apos;s a pretty powerful thing .
yes , it is .
that is beautiful , joanie .
look at that .
yes . do some spirals . do another one .
hey , you should flip that .
okay , well , i know my pancakes ,
and i &apos;ll flip it when i &apos;m ready .
it &apos;s bubbling . it &apos;s just ,
when it &apos;s bubbling , it &apos;s ready to be flipped .
wow . micromanage much ?
hey . you don &apos;t need to get all danny williams on me .
i &apos;m just trying to be helpful .
all right , well , if you want to be helpful ,
then why don &apos;t you go wake up aunt deb
and tell her breakfast is ready ?
you mean burned , right ?
it &apos;s not gonna be burned . you &apos;re gonna love it .
okay , hold on .
joanie , listen to me , okay ?
keep an eye on your mother .
she &apos;s got that weird look in her eye .
i don &apos;t want her to burn the house down . oh , my gosh .
go !
stop .
joanie , watch her .
don &apos;t listen to him . don &apos;t listen to him .
aunt deb , good morning .
hey , mary &apos;s burning breakfast downstairs
if you &apos;re hungry .
aunt deb ?

deb ?
okay , deb .
