For over a century, I have lived in secret until now.
I know the risk but I have to know her.
Elena, she's a dead ringer for Katherine.
What're you?
I'm a vampire.
I've been 17 years old since 1864.
I promise I will keep your secret.
But I can't be with you, Stefan.
5 dead bodies are all drained of blood.
They've come back.
Hello brother.
Damon.
She's in the transition.
Into what?
A vampire.
Vicki. What the hell?
Why is everybody having to die on me?
Can you make him forget?
I'll do it
What do you want him to know.
Vicki left town.
He's gonna miss her. But he knows it's for the best.
Damon?
Lexi?
Hi.
What are you doing here?
How could you even ask that?
I missed you.
Happy birthday.
I don't know, ok.
Some freak shot at me with wooden bullets,
I'd been buried under 60.
And why is a news reporter hunting vampires?
I don't know. I don't know who knows about us.
I mean, that guy did.
There could be others. Hey, do me a favor.
While you're here, please be careful.
Why stay?
I'm headed to New York for the weekend.
Bon Jovi in the garden.
"Wanted Dead Or Alive."
That's our theme song.
It'll be a blast.
Hey, do you think that he would actually remember us?
That was a pretty crazy weekend, huh?
We can make him remember us.
Come on!
Let's go.
I mean, what's keeping you here?
I told you.
Her name is Elena.
Well, let's hope she's better
Than the last girl you got all sprung over.
You didn't even know Katherine.
'Cause if I did,
I'd kick her ass. Little bitch.
Speaking of... Where's Damon?
Inflicting misery somewhere.
Hey, um, you gonna be ok here alone?
I got some things I gotta take care of.
Well, it's not exactly like I can go anywhere.
And you and Damon are the only ones
With these nifty little daylight rings.
I have a mood ring from '75. Trade ya?
Doesn't work that way, and you know it.
Yeah.
Hey, Lex...
I'm really glad that you came here.
Ok, what are we doing for your birthday?
It's not every day a guy turns 162 years old.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
Where did Vicki say she was going?
She didn't.
Did she tell her brother where she was going?
No. She didn't say anything to me.
She told Jeremy to tell me she was leaving town.
Well, is there anyone I can talk to
That may know what happened
To her prior to her leaving town?
Stefan Salvatore may know.
He came by the house to see her,
But she wouldn't talk to him.
What was he doing there?
I was trying to help her.
I knew that Elena was worried about her brother.
He was dating Vicki, and she had a drug problem,
So I tried to help.
So you got involved because Elena asked you to?
I asked Stefan to help.
I thought that by helping Vicki,
He was helping my brother.
What was her behavior like those last few days
Before she left?
Up and down.
Very sketchy,
Like she was coming down from some major party.
Any signs of aggression or violence?
Not that I remember.
No. No.
So you believe Vicki really has left town?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I'll miss her, but...
I think it's for the best.
I was tryin' to help her, Matt.
That's all.
I'll meet you guys at the car.
Ok.
You ok?
I don't think the sheriff suspected anything.
Jeremy had no memory at all.
All he knew was what Damon made him know.
Thank you.
I can't do this, Stefan.
Every time I look at Matt or Jeremy,
All I think is that Vicki is never gonna come back,
And they'll never know why.
Around you, people get hurt, and people die,
And I just--I-- It's just too much. I--
Why don't we go somewhere and talk about it?
No.
Stefan, you have to stay away from me.
Hello, Lexi.
What an unexpected surprise.
Unexpected surprise?
I think the wrong brother went back to high school.
How long you here for?
Just for Stefan's b-day.
Aww. You mean you didn't come all this way to see me?
Heh. That's it, Damon.
After a century, I finally realized
Death means nothing without you.
Do me.
Aw, why are you so mean to me?
Uh, have you met you?
You're not a nice person.
Well, because I'm a vampire.
But you're only the bad parts.
Teach me to be good.
I'm older, and that means stronger.
Sorry.
Don't ruin my time with Stefan,
'Cause I'll hurt you.
And you know I can do it.
Yeah.
You leavin'?
Dad doesn't like it when I stay here too much.
Because he misses you, or because he doesn't trust me?
Your father's problem is he lacks imagination.
He thinks I fill your head with all my witchy juju.
He's right.
He's always right. That's his other problem.
Uh-uh. You need to be wearin' that.
I gotta get it back to Caroline.
It doesn't belong to me.
Yes, it does. It was your ancestor's,
And now it's yours.
Emily was your ancestor, too. Why don't you wear it?
It didn't find me. It found you,
Protected you.
A witch's talisman is a powerful tool.
Don't be givin' that back to anybody.
I just wish it was prettier.
You're wallowing.
So are you.
My wallow is legitimate.
I was dumped.
Yeah. Well, Logan's a jerk.
You didi't get a brushoff e-mail
Saying, "I'm leaving town. See ya."
Wanna keep it down over there?
Why? What are you doing?
Homework.
Since when do you do homework?
I gotta finish this. I'm way behind,
And I have a quiz tomorrow, so...
What do you think?
Alien?
Some sort of replicant.
He can hear you.
Yeah?
Send him in.
Mr. Salvatore, come on in.
Uh, could you get the door for me?
Sure.
I understand from Mrs. Lockwood
That your uncle's out of town.
Yes, he is.
Um, but I spoke with Zach.
He filled me in and asked if I could bring this to you.
Vervain.
That's all we have at the momt.
I hope it's enough.
It's a small circle--
Founding families, a few city officials.
And your deputies, of course, right?
Are we any closer?
I think our facts are wrong.
We've always believed that vampires
Can only come out in the dark.
What if that's changed?
Is--is that even possible?
We've exhausted every other option.
We have to consider the vampire
May be walking around during the day right in front of us.
So what's the next step?
We're now looking at anyone
New to town since the deaths began.
Should turn up a suspect or two.
And I of course will do anything I can to help.
You up?
No.
No.
No.
Why haven't you called me back?
I'm sorry.
Are you gonna stay in there forever?
Yep.
Move over.
I'm officially worried.
What's going on?
I'm tired of thinking, of talking.
Can I get a one-line version
So I can at least pretend be helpful?
Stefan and I broke up.
I'm so sorry.
Are you ok?
Right. Stupid question.
I know I've been kind of M.I.A.
When you need me the most.
I suck.
You wanna make it up to me?
Get my mind off of it.
Just remember you asked for it.
Uh, be patient.
I need to swear you to secrecy.
It's kind of a bad week for that kind of stuff.
Swear, 'cause I'm not supposed to be showing you this.
Ok. I swear.
Ok, there's no windows open, right?
Right.
There's no fan, no air conditioning.
None. What are you doing?
Grams just showed me this.
You're gonna love it.
You ready?
Bonnie, what's going on?
It's true, Elena,
Everything my grams told me.
It's impossible
But it's true.
I'm a witch.
I believe you.
Look, dungeon boy
I'm done being your little slave girl.
You seriously hurt me, and I will be damned if you think--
Oh, my god.
Where have you been?
It's really good to see you.
Much better.
You wanna throw a party here at the grill tonight.
Well, why don't you do it?
Because then stefan and his b.f.f. Won't come.
I need a lot of people, big crowd. Invite everyone.
And why am I having this party?
Because you are gonna help me solve this town's little vampire problem.
And I want my crystal back.
Oh, but Bonnie has it.
I know that.
Get it from her.
So, this Elena girl,
She'll come around. I'm sure of it.
Have you had sex yet?
No.
Sex always works.
I mean, you'll rock her world so hard with your vamp sex
She'll be yours forever.
Yeah, but see, this isn't about sex
Or--or compulsion or any of our other tricks.
She has to want to be with me on her own terms.
Wow. That sounded all mature and grown-up.
Well, I'm not getting any older.
Want some?
No. Thank you.
Relax. I didn't kill anyone for it.
This phlebotomist I went out with a few times
He's my supplier.
Oh, don't judge, ok?
Listen, I tried the animal diet.
Lasted 3 weeks.
Doesn't matter.
'Cause if I started again, I just--I don't know.
If you could stop.
Lexi, I'd never judge you.
I'm just jealous of your restraint.
I have none.
I delight in hedonism.
Speaking of which,
What are we doing tonight?
Funny you should ask.
Well, I wasn't asking you.
There's a party at the Grill. You'll love it.
Banquettes, tacky wait staff.
All of stefan's friends.
Yeah, don't want a birthday party.
Well, it's not for you. It's a party party.
no one's gonna know it's your birthday
Caroline's throwing it.
Damon, stay away from Caroline.
We're friends. It's cool.
It's important for the town to see us
Out and about like normal folk.
We need to blend.
I prefer mine at 98.6.
Let's go.
Please?
It's weird, huh.
After all this time joking about being psychic,
I really am a witch.
You don't think i'm a freak now, do you?
No. Of course not.
Uh, bonnie, i just-- i don't understand, though.
If your grams asked you to keep all this a secret,
Why did you tell me?
You're my best friend.
I can't keep secrets from you.
I'm almost ready.
Can't believe you actually think
That we should go to this thing.
It's not I'm asking you to run outside
Midday without your ring.
I mean, seriously, it's a party.
A party that damon wants to go to, you know.
So my question is, "why?"
I think he's up to something.
Who cares? I mean, what can he possibly do
In front of all those people in a public place?
He knows how to keep a low profile, believe me.
Ok. So he'll behave.
Come on. One day a year, I get you,
One day that you're not brooding
And existing in your own head.
It's my birthday, yeah?
It's my day, and that guy
That jumped naked in the trevi fountain
And got unun on the torch of the statue of liberty,
That guy can take a break from all
Of his worrying from one night.
And go to a stupid party.
So quit your whining...
And go get ready.
Fine.
It's open. come on in.
Oh, my god.
How, uh...
Who...
Uh, I'm elena.
Who are you?
Lexi, a friend of Stefan's.
Is he here?
He's in the shower.
Um, do you wanna wait?
No.
I'll tell him you stopped by.
That's ok.
Are you out of your freaking mind?
What are you talking about?
I just met Elena.
You have some serious explaining to do.
You have some serious emotional damage.
No, it's not what you think.
She's not Katherine.
Then they're related, because they could be twins.
I don't know.
You don't know. You--you didn't find out?
No. Maybe I don't wanna know。
I have--I have no desire to tie Elena to Katherine.
Ok, yes, yes, the--
The resemblance is what drew me in,
But that's it.
Katherine and Elena may look the same on the outside,
But on the inside, they are completely different.
Oh, so Elena's not a raging bitch then, huh?
No.
No, Elena is...
Elena's warm,
And she's--
She's kind, and she's caring,
And she's selfless,
And it's real.
And honestly, when I'm around her,
I--I completely forget what I am.
Oh, my god.
You're in love with her.
Yeah, I am.
Amazing party, right?
Glad you thought of it.
Well, are you having a good time?
Do you have my crystal?
No.
Then I'm not having a good time.
Where's my brother?
Said he'd meet me here.
Buy you a...
What are you doing here?
Um, Lexi said that you came by
And you--you seemed upset.
Right.
The girl in the towel.
The towel?
Oh. No, no.
no, no, no, no. Um...
Not like that. No.
Uh, she's not exactly a girl. Lexi's--
Um, she's 350 years old.
You mean she's a...
And she's my oldest friend.
Nothing romantic.
Ever.
Ok, well...
She kept staring at me.
It was weird.
Well, you know, I've talked about you
A lot, so...
Guess she felt like she knew you.
So why'd you come by?
I, uh--
It was a mistake.
Elena, talk to me.
I can't.
Stefan, I can't, and that's the problem.
I'm keeping all these secrets from everyone.
I can't even tell my best friend.
Do you know how hard that is?
It's like I need to talk to someone,
But the only person I can talk to is you,
And...
I want you to know
That I will always be here for you.
You can come to me about anything, ok?
Well, thank you for coming by.
Hey, do you need a ride to the grill tonight?
Are you going to caroline's party?
Lexi's dragging me.
And...
It's my birthday.
Really?
Happy birthday then.
Thank you.
Actually, I, um--
I think I'm gonna stay in tonight.
Ok.
Well, have-- Have a good night.
Bonnie!
Hey, I've been looking for you.
I'm totally sorry to do this.
I know it's so indian giver
And I know we're not even supposed to say that anymore,
But I need my crystal back.
Why? You said you hated it.
Then I saw it on you
And I realized how great it is.
and I've got, like, 3 outfits i can coordinate it with, so--
I can't give it back to you.
Ok.
Uh, well, I didn't want to have to tell you this
But I'm your friend. When you wear it,
It makes you look fat.
There. I said it,
But it's because I'm your friend, so--
I'm sorry. Caroline, I can't.
Well, what do you mean
That you can't, bonnie? It's mine.
I thought you said it was damon's.
Well, it is.
So he's the one who really wants it back?
No.
Maybe. Just--
Are you wearing polyester?
You were really gonna pull it from my neck?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Matt.
Just hear me out?
Please?
I was just trying to help vicki. Uh...
I went through something similar once.
I'm really sorry.
Don't be.
It's not the first time she's run off.
Turns out vicki's just like her mother.
I can't count on either of 'em.
Thanks for trying.
Where is it?
Bonnie won't give it to me.
So rip it off her neck.
I tried. It shocked me.
Damn it.
Why does it do that?
I need that crystal.
Why are you being like this?
I'm so good to you, and I'd do anying, you know?
It's just some stupid necklace.
No.
You are the only stupid thing here.
And shallow.
And useless.
Ok, I'm gonna need a little more foot movement.
Yeah,
I'm not really-- Not really interested in making a fool out of myself.
Come on. You're not that bad.
Do me a favor. Tell me if you see Damon with his camera phone.
Right.
Where do we going?
No one is gonna see us here.
Did you hear something?
No. It's cool.
There's no one coming down here.
Nice!
Stefan smiles.
Alert the media.
You haven't given him a lot of reasons to be happy lately.
Oh, you're right. Poor Stefan.
Persecuted throughout eternity by his depraved brother.
Does it get tiring being so righteous?
Humph. It flares up in the presence of psychopaths.
Ouch. Well, consider this psychopath's feelings hurt.
What did you do to my brother?
I'm gonna need a less vague question.
When you did what you did to jeremy's memory of Vicki,
What else did you do to him?
You asked me to take away his memory
Of fangs and rowr and all the bad stuff.
You wanted me to take away his suffering.
But he's acting different.
He seems ok with everything, and a little too ok.
I mean, he's studying. He's not doing drugs. He's not drinking.
Are you sure you didn't do something else?
Elena, I took away his suffering.
Caroline
Don't talk to me.
Don't do that. Let me explain.
Well, what is there to explain, Bonnie?
Ok, you got what you wanted, yeah,
And something that doesn't even belong to you, by the way.
And I get called, a shallow, useless, waste of space.
Who said that to you?
Well, who do you think?
You know that's not true.
Don't let him treat you like that.
Yeah, as opposed to how my best friend treats me.
Two shots of tequila.
Make that three.
You know, I need to see some I.D.
No, you don't.
That'll be, uh--
Free.
On the house.
Thanks.
Ah, the famous Elena.
Towel girl.
I've been called worse.
Here.
I didn't know that you guys could drink.
Oh, yeah. It helps curb the cravings,
But makes for a lot of lushy vamps.
You know, I've never seen Stefan drunk.
He always seems so...
Uptight?
Yeah. Yeah.
But not with you.
Well, that's the benefit of knowing someone for over 100 years.
You can just be yourself.
Yeah, he can't be himself with me.
Well, not yet.
The first step was him telling you.
The rest comes with time.
You seem so sure.
The love of my life was human.
He went through what I imagine you're going through--
Denial, anger, et cetera.
But at the end of the day,
Love really did conquer all.
Are you gonna drink that?
Oh. No.
Go for it.
I'm scared.
But you're here...
'Cause you're crazy about him.
I get it, ok?
I mean, What's not to love?
Listen. Take it from someone who's been around a long time.
When it's real, you can't walk away.
Hey, Lexi.
It was really nice meeting you.
Yep, I drank yours. Sorry.
Thank you.
You weren't supposed to be listening.
I was feeling epic.
Whatever.
Keep this contained.
That's not all.
Did you see what did this?
Tell me everything you saw.
Hi.
Hey.
You came.
I couldn't miss your hundredth and whatever birthday.
I slim-- I'm slipped.
I slipped.
Hammered, huh?
Well... a very nice but not handsome bartender
Was very kind to me tonight.
Unlike the rest of the global humanverse.
Are those curly fries?
Coffee for the drunk girl.
Bad night, huh?
Baddest.
Am I shallow?
Heh. Is that a trick question?
I don't mean to be.
I--I wanna be deep.
I wanna be, like, the abyss deep.
No offense, care,
But deep's really not your scene.
That's true.
I'm shallow.
I am worse than shallow.
I'm a kiddie pool.
You're not a kiddie pool.
You're not a kiddie pool.
Can I just go home?
Yeah.
Ok.
I'll take you. Come on.
Hey, you're ok.
She's all right. Hold still. Hold still.
All right.
What happened?
Is she ok?
Like you care.
She's drunk?
As a skunk.
Are they serving you in there?
Uh, I'll take her home.
It's on my way. I haven't been drinking.
I would appreciate that, Matt. Thank you.
You and I will discuss this later.
Mmm. Can't wait.
Don't let anybody else leave.
All right, the shots are a bribe.
I need you to answer a question.
What are you really doing in Mystic Falls?
Have you tried the brittle? It wins awards.
Cut the crap.
Ok.
I have a diabolical master plan.
What is it?
Well, if I told you, it wouldn't be
Very diabolical, now, would it?
Ok, look around.
Let me know if you see him.
What are you doing?
Thank you for the vervain.
Now if you'll excuse me.
Oh, my god.
What is it?
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Can't go out this way.
Shh. Shh.
Why?
It's part of the plan.
You ok?
Thank you.
Get it in the car quickly.
Lady, I checked everyone's I.D.
Yeah, apparently you didn't.
Pretty handy with that stake, Damon.
It just, uh--reflex.
I guess the adrenaline kicked in.
This nightmare is finally over.
Yeah. Caught a lucky break with that witness.
Without her, you wouldn't have been able to I.D. the vampire.
Very lucky.
Well, thank you again.
You're welcome.
You gonna be ok?
No.
Do you ever feel like there's not a person
In the world that loves you?
Life can be a little rough.
I just wish...
What?
Wish that life was...
Different.
Yeah. Me, too.
Please...
Don't leave me alone.
Stefan.
Stefan.
He killed her.
He killed Zach.
He killed Tanner. He turned Vicki.
I have to kill him.
No. You can't do that.
Why are you trying to save him, Elena?
He's never gonna change. Don't you see that?
He's never gonna change.
I'm not trying to save him.
I'm trying to save you. You have no idea.
What this will do to you. Please, Stefan.
Everywhere that I go, pain and death follow.
Damon follows me.
No more.
Stefan, please. Please, just--just talk to me.
Let me be here for you. Talk to me.
No.
You were right to stay away from me.
Told you I'd take care of it.
Come on. I did this for you
To get 'em off our trail.
You never do anything for anyone but yourself.
You missed.
No. You saved my life.
I'm sparing yours.
We're even.
And now we're done.
