when the doctors told us
that neither of us was a match for our little boy ,
that he would die without a bone @-@ marrow transplant ,
we were in despair .
but the best day of our lives was when an anonymous donor
stepped up and saved our son ...
don &apos;t tell me that was you .
funny .
we knew we had to be the ones to start m.i.l.e. ,
a bone @-@ marrow database
that matches strangers through dna .
but we could only do it with the help from all of you ,
so thank you .
all right , let &apos;s go .
excuse me , waiter .
sorry . i don &apos;t work here .
i told you to wear a dress .
i only came because you said the food was gonna be good .
care for some ?
oh , look . more peanuts .
no .
why did you tell me that wolfgang puck was catering ?
well , he was supposed to .
it was a last @-@ minute decision
to put the money into the charity .
it wouldn &apos;t hurt you to be charitable .
i spent eight bucks on the beer . does that count ?
can we please get something that isn &apos;t served in coach ?
okay , i &apos;m on the board of directors .
i can &apos;t just leave .
can i ?
yeah . who &apos;s gonna know ?
live dangerously . come on .
dr. isles .
thank you for all you &apos;ve done for m.i.l.e.
of course . it &apos;s an important cause .
this is my colleague , detective jane rizzoli .
thanks for attending our event .
yeah , i should thank you
for sinking that putt on the 18th in the open .
i won the office pool .
golf fan , huh ? do you play ?
well , that &apos;s not really a fair question
coming from a pro who regularly shoots a 61 .
oh , honey , i think it &apos;s time for you
to go work your magic with the platinum table .
dr. isles , could i snag you ?
those are all grumpy doctors .
i have a bad feeling they only came for the food .
who would do that ?
i bet they &apos;d open their wallets
if i introduced them to the chief medical examiner .
i &apos;d be happy to help .
excuse me .
dr. isles made such a generous donation
to m.i.l.e. this year .
yeah .
well , that maura ...
she &apos;s a giver .
mm . how about you , jane ?
are you a giver ?
what ?
would you excuse us ?
can i borrow you for a second , please ?
excuse me .
what is the matter ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
if we don &apos;t get out of here ,
taylor franklin is gonna help herself
to what &apos;s left of my bank account .
well , how much money did you give her ?
a thousand bucks .
and she wants more .
just say no .
i don &apos;t want to appear cheap .
oh , no . here she comes . please , can we go ?
oh , no . come on . i &apos;m having such a nice time .
can &apos;t you just , like , mingle ?
when have you ever seen me mingle ?
can i get some more peanuts ?
we ran out .
well , let me at least introduce you .
brad is a charming conversationalist ,
a post @-@ modern art aficionado ,
and a prominent colorectal surgeon .
wow , i never thought i &apos;d hear
the words &quot; charming &quot; and &quot; rectal &quot;
used in the same sentence .
oh , stop . come on . just join us .
no , and listen to a butt doctor
talk about art on an empty stomach ?
no . it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m leaving .
okay . here . just take my car .
you sure ?
yes . i &apos;ll catch a cab .
no , i think you &apos;ll get a ride home .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;ve seen hung liu &apos;s work .
of course .
the -- the way she addresses
issues of identity , marginality , sexism , and racism
is -- is awe @-@ inspiring .
it is so refreshing to hear a man talk like this .
you know , female artists are so marginalized .
god , i @-@ i could talk to you all night .
i could talk to you , too .
oh , it &apos;s late .
uh , i should go . i @-@ it &apos;s a school night .
uh , you sure ?
a chateau de la valence .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s one of my favorites .
i &apos;m gonna regret this tomorrow .
what &apos;s tomorrow ?
whatever the coroner &apos;s van drags in ,
blood work to be reviewed ,
two trials to prep for .
thank you .
i &apos;m also hoping to start the identification process
on some human remains we discovered
at a construction site .
oh , i did a rotation in forensic anthropology .
i found it fascinating .
yeah , we &apos;ve been waiting for all the bones to come in
to make sure we &apos;re only dealing with one victim .
so , it &apos;s a homicide ?
open case .
i really can &apos;t talk about it .
i &apos;m sorry .
tell me about your work .
no , e @-@ even i don &apos;t want to talk about my work .
yours is a lot more interesting .
well , cheers to that .
cheers .
salud .
i still think you &apos;re wrong about cindy sherman .
okay , okay , i &apos;ll give you cindy
if you give me sandy skoglund .
deal .
i find it so hard to believe
that you know so much about female artists .
the female that i &apos;d --
i &apos;d really like to know more about is you .
taxi .
oh , no , no . there &apos;s no way i &apos;m letting you take a cab .
come on . i &apos;m just parked around the corner .
come on .
i don &apos;t trust valets .
i don &apos;t .
come on .
thank you .
maura !
hey , maura !
where &apos;s maura ? we &apos;ve got a homicide .
she &apos;s not answering her phone . i have her car .
what &apos;s happening ? - oh , she got home late --
aound 5 a.m.
are you working on this case ?
so grisly .
they found bones at the new mall site .
too bad . i wanted to shop there .
check this out .
what are you doing ?
maura and i have been watching self @-@ defense videos .
ooh , i feel so empowered !
i can see why .
you &apos;re so good at it .
maybe she went to get some coffee .
maura .
hello ?
hey , maura . did i wake you ?
uh ... well , let me see .
i &apos;m talking to you on the phone .
yeah .
what happened last night ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know , but my head is killing me .
that &apos;s it ?
what -- there &apos;s no scientific explanation
for the common hangover ?
no lobes ? no craniums ?
no dehydration ? what , nothing ?
ma , can you get her a cup of coffee ?
are you okay ?
that is ugly .
oh , come on . he &apos;s not even bleeding .
i meant the car .
there are those that consider
the chevrolet citation a classic .
yeah , a classic mistake .
it &apos;s one of the 50 worst cars ever made .
which means you owned one .
yeah . so ?
that car required more maintenance
than any of my wives .
dr. isles is wearing what she had on
when she left last night .
you can wear the same thing
if it &apos;s to the walk of shame .
hey , watch yourself .
all right , what have we got ?
adult male , mid to late 30s .
meter maid found him around 7 : 00 a.m.
keys are still in the ignition .
no drag marks outside the vehicle .
oh , so , he was killed inside the car .
it looks like he was punched in the throat .
maura , what do you think ?
uh , is it bright out here ?
uh , did you guys get an i.d. ?
not yet .
no .
i ran the plates .
car &apos;s registered to a dorothy macallister , deceased .
her son sold the car for cash last week
and didn &apos;t get a name .
open bar at the charity event last night ?
i have no idea .
body &apos;s not in full rigor .
time of death within the last eight hours .
maura , what is it ?
there &apos;s a lot of bruising right there .
oh , is that the guy from last night ?
yeah .
when &apos;s the last time you saw him ?
jane ...
maura , what is your i.d. badge doing in the victim &apos;s car ?
i don &apos;t know .
how do we keep this from becoming
a media feeding frenzy ?
paddy doyle &apos;s trial is next week .
if i didn &apos;t know dr. isles , i &apos;d rush to judgment .
&quot; mob boss &apos;s daughter kills her date . &quot;
but we know dr. isles didn &apos;t do it ,
so maybe someone set her up .
it wouldn &apos;t be that hard to steal her i.d. card ,
put it in his car .
okay , here &apos;s what i need to know .
does she have an alibi ?
she can &apos;t account for her whereabouts
1 : 00 to 5 : 00 a.m.
but what about witnesses ?
did anyone see them together ?
yeah , i saw them together ,
and so did everybody at that benefit .
we &apos;ve held off talking to them .
why &apos;s that ?
because it &apos;s dr. isles , sean .
what &apos;s she say happened ?
she can &apos;t remember anything .
okay . this is as bad as it gets .
we &apos;ve got to bring her in for questioning .
what ?
how can we investigate her ?
we work with her .
every cop in massachusetts
has worked with her at some point .
right now , it &apos;s our investigation .
but what about the autopsy ?
well , the governor assigned that , uh ...
dr. vladimir popov to the case .
popov can &apos;t find his own ass
unless you put his hand on it .
i know .
well , get ready .
this is gonna be worse than you shooting paddy doyle .
yeah , governor .
yes , i can hear you , sir .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
we &apos;ve got to do our job , jane .
do we have to do this right now ?
look at her . something &apos;s off .
no , she was out of it this morning ,
like someone else was in her body .
is she a drinker ?
no .
i mean , wine .
maybe somebody slipped a roofie .
yeah .
yeah . the victim was a doctor .
take a tox screen after you interview her .
why after ? why not do it now ?
we have to treat her like anybody else .
i don &apos;t like this any better than you do .
we should probably should do a rape kit , too .
oh , my god .
jane , you want me to do the interview ?
no . i &apos;ll do it .
rizzoli , you can &apos;t go in there
unless you &apos;re gonna go at her like any other suspect .
i can do that .
okay .
i just ran a background check on brad adams .
you got to see this .
did brad adams tell you what he did for a living ?
yes , i told you , jane .
he was a colorectal surgeon .
what did you talk about ?
art .
my work . he ...
he ordered one of my favorite wines .
did you leave the m.i.l.e. benefit with him ?
yes .
how did you get home ?
i , uh ...
i wanted to take a cab .
check the taxi companies .
see if there &apos;s any record .
okay .
how did your i.d. get in the victim &apos;s car ?
i &apos;m not sure .
i remember walking past the valet ,
and then ...
did he kiss me ? i --
i think he blew me a kiss .
he blew you a kiss ?
do you remember anything after that ?
oh , no .
i was in his car .
she just put herself at the murder scene .
oh , no .
brad adams had a record of theft and drug possession .
he owed $ 39,000 in back child support ,
and he wasn &apos;t a doctor .
he was a bouncer at a night club .
oh , god .
he played her .
the question is why .
it &apos;s getting hot in here .
oh , god .
where did you get those bruises ?
multiple hematomas .
likely offensive in nature
due to the location on the arm .
this type of bruising would occur if i --
i threw a punch and it was blocked by someone &apos;s arm .
dr. isles , are you saying
that you attacked brad adams ?
i ...
i don &apos;t know . maybe .
why would you do that ?
i was provoked ?
research indicates that even the most docile human
is capable of murder in the right set of circumstances .
now what the hell do we do ?
we take pictures and process her clothes .
do you think that &apos;s the right call ?
we don &apos;t have a choice .
better us than anybody else .
i &apos;m so sorry , dr. isles .
you &apos;re just doing your job , susie .
we &apos;re gonna need your underwear , too .
you know , i have processed hundreds of suspects ,
but i never truly understood
how humiliating this is .
i &apos;m so sorry , maura .
don &apos;t be . you didn &apos;t do it .
you didn &apos;t , either .
maybe i did .
i &apos;ve got a @-@ a void in my brain
where there should be a memory ,
and i &apos;ve certainly experienced
the kind of rage it would take
to inflict that kind of an injury .
just don &apos;t say anything else , okay ?
dr. maura isles , of course ,
首席法医艾尔斯医生被控谋杀
is the commonwealth &apos;s chief medical examiner ,
and she &apos;s back in the news again .
just weeks before her notorious father ,
mobster paddy doyle , goes on trial
for 15 murders and countless r.i.c.o. charges ,
dr. isles is herself now a murder suspect
in what some are calling a date gone wrong .
turn it off .
this is a bizarre stor--
it &apos;s all over the internet , too .
what do we know about our victim ,
the phony colorectal doctor ?
well ... we know he was a real asshole .
and he was also a thief ,
a drug dealer , and a predator .
so he had enemies .
here &apos;s something .
he had a pretty pissed @-@ off ex @-@ wife .
she wasn &apos;t getting a penny of the $ 39,000
he owed her in child support .
she &apos;d at least get social security if he was dead .
let &apos;s bring her in for a chat .
how &apos;s maura ?
terrible .
how are you ?
not as bad as maura .
what can i do ?
just help her .
talk to everybody that brad adams knew --
neighbors , the ex @-@ wife ,
everybody that he worked with at the club .
okay , martinez cleared it
because he &apos;s got a history of drug arrests .
you got it .
hey , wait . check on ma first .
make sure she &apos;s okay .
can you guys give us a minute , please ?
you want me to call your lawyer ?
you want me to call your parents ?
no .
you know they got to take you to the hospital for this .
yeah , i know . for the rape kit .
i know the drill .
look , just -- just do your job , jane .
whatever happens , happens .
there &apos;s no way maura murdered someone .
jane &apos;s got to do something .
she is , ma . we all are .
do you have scotch ?
no .
i don &apos;t drink scotch .
a double espresso -- whole milk today .
and when do you start making fries ?
i &apos;ll , uh , start now .
how &apos; bout you ? how are you holding up ?
i &apos;m worried sick .
susie , i know you &apos;re not supposed to say anything ,
but could you tell me something about the dead man ?
we have to wait until dr. popov does the autopsy .
wait -- - and he &apos;s not here --
dr. popov ?
the guy who carries a gallon of vodka
and calls me &quot; girl &quot; ?
oh , boy .
maura &apos;s really in trouble now .
i looked ...
and if i were a guesser , which i &apos;m not ,
i &apos;d say that the cause of death was ...
asphyxiation due to a crushed trachea .
if i &apos;m right , it was caused by
a direct , powerful punch to the throat .
whoever did this knew what they were doing .
you okay ?
yeah , yeah .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna , uh ...
get that espresso started .
you &apos;re back .
what are you doing here ?
everything i can before popov shows up pickled .
that &apos;s kind of funny , right ? pickled popov .
maura , you can &apos;t be here . you can &apos;t be working this case .
well , am i under arrest ?
no .
is my tox screen back ?
not yet . why ? do you think you were drugged ?
i had a lot of wine .
who knows ?
what did the hospital say ?
there &apos;s no evidence of sexual assault .
good .
at least i could &apos;ve claimed self @-@ defense .
have you remembered something ?
no . no .
it &apos;s just i have done too much reading
on the science of murder .
in the presence of a threat ,
the brain activity shifts from the --
the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
to the midbrain periaqueductal gray .
i have no idea what that means ,
and for once , i don &apos;t want to know .
these bruises say rage --
my rage .
dr. isles , what the hell ?
i need you to clear out of this office now .
officer kelly ,
i want you to remove her .
lieutenant , this was my fault .
no , jane , it &apos;s okay . lieutenant .
what the hell were you thinking , rizzoli ?
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m so sorry .
we found your ex @-@ husband like that .
you don &apos;t look too sad .
me ?
i &apos;m trying not to smile .
where were you last night ?
trying to make enough money to feed his kid .
are you a working girl , vivian ?
i &apos;m a massage therapist .
a therapist , huh ?
&quot; vivian &apos;s hot hands .
come in for your happy ending . &quot;
i &apos;ll give you the cop discount , huh ?
and i &apos;ll give you 18 months in framingham
unless you tell us exactly where you were last night .
i was with a client .
we &apos;ll need to talk to him .
his name &apos;s john .
if you find him , tell him he &apos;s a lousy tipper , huh ?
happy hands vivian has been picked up a couple of times .
maybe she got one of her clients to do her a favor --
take her husband out .
she &apos;s got a lot of clients who are cops .
a cop could &apos;ve set maura up .
that &apos;s a lot of free happy endings .
she &apos;s not cooperating .
we &apos;ll have to do a lot of digging
to come up with a client list .
in the mean time , what do we do with 50 people
who saw maura leave with the victim ?
anybody see them get into his car ?
no .
okay , that &apos;s good .
is csru finished with the car ?
not yet .
all right , what about tucker and taylor franklin ?
was brad adams on their guest list ?
publicist and the executive director said he wasn &apos;t .
they never heard of the guy .
god , we need a break .
come in .
angela .
what &apos;s up ?
sean , i have something i have to show you .
okay .
okay , but before i do ...
you don &apos;t think maura did this , do you ?
angela , i @-@ i can &apos;t talk about that .
okay , well , this is really hard ,
and i don &apos;t know what else to do .
what is it ?
here , can you look at this ?
okay , i just learned this one .
it &apos;s called the horizontal elbow strike ,
and it &apos;s the most effective tool
for close @-@ quarter combat .
when am i gonna be in close @-@ quarter combat ?
well , you could literally kill a man with this move .
come hold the board .
hold it this way .
you &apos;re lucky i trust you . ready !
so what ? she can break a board .
put yourself in a courtroom
and act like a cop , rizzoli .
it demonstrates that the suspect
had the knowledge and the skill
to perform the underlying act that caused the murder .
dr. isles &apos; tox screen is back .
no rohypnol in her system ,
and , um , we matched the skin
found under dr. isles &apos; nails ,
and it matches the victim .
csru report is in .
they found dr. isles &apos; fingerprints
and her hair
in the back seat of his car .
come on , bass .
i &apos;ve got dandelion greens
and endive with parsley .
come on .
i can &apos;t get bass to eat .
he is definitely responding
to the stress in his environment .
oh , no .
i &apos;m so sorry .
maura isles , you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of brad adams .
i know you .
you &apos;re the bitch that put my old man away .
no , that wasn &apos;t me .
yeah , it was .
i &apos;ve seen you before .
many studies have indicated that eyewitness identifications
can be wrong in up to 35 % of cases
when you account for lighting , distance , and visual acuity .
you even sound like a cop .
actually , i am the chief medical examiner
for the commonwealth of massachusetts .
she &apos;s a cop .
i &apos;m not a cop . looks like this little bird
picked the wrong place to land .
get off her , gomez !
get off me ! get off me !
get off !
you &apos;re getting two chits for that .
you okay ?
thanks .
you need medical attention ?
could i get some ice ?
you got it .
paddy doyle sends his regards .
what ?
i &apos;ll get &apos; em to bring that ice .
you need anything else , you ask for mary pat , you hear ?
olives and ketchup ?
you &apos;re not really gonna eat that , are you ?
it &apos;s moldy cheese or this .
what do you got on brad adams ?
local boy .
he &apos;s been working as a bouncer for the last few years
all over town .
he was employed at a high @-@ end club ,
hollow venom , for about a year .
a lot of celebrities go there .
well , word is he was the hook @-@ up for drugs and women .
ivy @-@ league dropout .
life fell apart when he developed a drug habit .
smart con man .
that explains how he managed
to convince maura he was a doctor .
i can go if you &apos;re expecting someone .
oh , yeah , i &apos;ve got a real romantic evening planned
while my best friend spends the night
avoiding the showers in a women &apos;s prison .
may i come in ?
come on , jane .
what ? i &apos;m not stopping her .
all right , i &apos;m sick about what happened today .
yeah , me , too .
w @-@ why would you give that to cavanaugh ?
because i couldn &apos;t give it to you .
why not , ma ?
jane .
be real .
you &apos;ve got her hair and fingerprints in his car ,
his skin under her nails .
it ...
it &apos;s not ma &apos;s fault she &apos;s in jail .
why would you go to your boyfriend instead of me ?
i was protecting you .
i didn &apos;t want to put you in a position
where you had to decide what to do with that video .
i know what i would &apos;ve done with that video .
i would &apos;ve deleted it .
oh , jane , the cop in you
would hate yourself if you did that .
and you &apos;d be charged with obstruction of justice .
most i &apos;d get is a year in jail .
maura &apos;s looking at life .
gomez , let &apos;s go .
you letting me out ?
i &apos;m escorting you to isolation .
i &apos;ll be back .
no way i &apos;m letting you take a cab .
i &apos;m just parked right around the corner .
what -- what happened to your face ?
i need you to get susie to do another tox screen .
excuse me .
attention , all inmates .
whoever did this to my friend &apos;s face
will have to look over her shoulder for the rest of her life ,
and if it happens again ,
it will be a very , very short life .
okay , jane , please .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t mean to embarrass you
in front of all your new friends .
okay , the tox screen .
yes .
we did it . you were clean .
no , no , no .
she has to do a specific screen
for scopolamine .
scopolamine ?
remember how i said i thought he blew me a kiss ?
yeah .
scopolamine is also called
&quot; the devil &apos;s breath &quot; -- it can be administered
by blowing it in someone &apos;s face .
well , that could explain a lot of this .
yeah , what explains this ?
you probably tried to get away .
which one hit you ?
it &apos;s not gonna happen again .
oh , yes , i &apos;m sure it was just a misunderstanding .
did you borrow someone &apos;s shank ?
it &apos;s okay . paddy put the word out .
that &apos;s not good , maura .
anyone that wants to hurt ppaddy will go after you .
just get me out of here , jane .
look , anybody comes close to you , okay ,
you just go with your elbow right to the throat ,
all right ?
just stay alive .
thank you . did i get you out of bed ?
no , i couldn &apos;t sleep ,
but i think you pulled lover @-@ boy from between the sheets .
hot date ?
not anymore .
how soon before we find out if it was scopolamine ?
susie &apos;s on it , but she said it &apos;s gonna take a few hours .
it &apos;s a street drug from south america .
and it says here it turns you into a zombie .
knew a guy who got dosed with it in colombia .
dumb place to vacation , if you ask me .
the second you &apos;re hit with it ,
you do anything anyone tells you and not remember doing it .
he gave up his atm code .
yeah , it &apos;s sometimes used as a date @-@ rape drug ,
but maura wasn &apos;t raped .
do you think brad used it on her
to get into her bank accounts ?
even if he did , somebody still had to kill him .
you think he had an accomplice ?
maybe . did you check brad &apos;s financials ?
his bank balance was pretty low .
what have we here ?
a deposit for $ 9,500 .
the week before the charity event ?
he knew the kind of art she liked ,
her favorite wine .
maura doesn &apos;t even have a facebook page .
but she does have an interview
in la femme vivant monthly .
this is a big profile .
it &apos;s all there --
the wine , the art , details about her job .
he did play her .
he went to that benefit to find her .
and 9,500 bucks in cash tells me he was paid to do it .
and then he got killed for his trouble .
korsak , you said this drug
will make you do anything you &apos;re told to do ?
frost , check her bank accounts ,
and if he wasn &apos;t after her money ,
what was he after ?
we have a theory .
so , he gave her some zombie drug
so he could rob her ,
then wiped out her bank account ?
as far as we can tell , he didn &apos;t take anything .
so , if he didn &apos;t rob her or sexually assault her ,
what did he do ?
well , we think he was after her i.d. card .
dr. isles &apos; card was swiped
to enter the m.e. &apos; s office at 2 : 04 a.m.
well , good . let &apos;s get the video .
there isn &apos;t any .
there isn &apos;t any ?
dr. isles was under the influence of the drug ,
which means she might have told him how to avoid the cameras .
you can take the funeral @-@ parlor ramp . no cameras there .
yeah , but you don &apos;t break into a place unless you want something ,
so what did he take ?
we haven &apos;t found anything missing ... yet .
but you have prints ?
we think he was wearing gloves .
so , you don &apos;t have a theory .
you &apos;ve got wishful thinking .
you &apos;re sure there &apos;s nothing gone ?
we double @-@ checked the inventory in here and in the autopsy room .
nothing &apos;s missing .
susie even checked the cold storage .
all the forensic specimens ,
all the bodies are accounted for .
well , he was looking for something . what was it ?
what about the bone room ? did anybody check that ?
we hardly ever go in there ,
but dr. isles leaves the key right over here .
you ever been in here ?
once . keypad &apos;s new .
dr. isles gave me the combination .
wait a minute . don &apos;t touch that .
that &apos;s a heat @-@ activated touch screen .
if brad wanted to get in ,
he &apos;d have to remove his gloves .
i might be able to lift a print .
405 , skull and femur
of a teenage john doe .
it &apos;s here .
i &apos;ll check the inventory .
got it .
i got it , too .
looks like a right index finger .
oh , korsak , that &apos;s great .
i &apos;ll get it to latent prints .
okay .
uh , 1204 .
partial adult female skull .
okay .
1304 ... is empty .
is it supposed to be empty ?
no .
what &apos;s supposed to be in it ?
bones that were discovered at the stonehaven mall site .
they were in that drawer ?
well , i couldn &apos;t begin the forensic identification process
until all the recovery was complete ,
but i had a near @-@ complete skeleton .
so , what can you tell us about those bones ?
i @-@ i &apos;d be guessing .
oh , okay .
never mind . have fun in prison .
tell paddy i said &quot; hi . &quot;
be happy to pass that along .
oh , i hate doing this .
uh ... she was was a female in her 20s .
okay , start checking the ncic missing @-@ persons database .
it &apos;s not much to go on .
uh , maura , what about height ?
i didn &apos;t have enough of the femur or rib cage yet .
so , between 5 and 6 feet ?
yes , i think i could agree with that .
oh , that &apos;s a big help .
you sure it wasn &apos;t between 4 and 7 feet ?
7 feet ?
let &apos;s make her 5 &apos; 6 . &quot;
okay , you know , i know what you &apos;re doing .
you &apos;re gonna say that she was just 300 pounds
so i could say , no , she was approximately 110 to 120 .
you get that ?
see ? was that so hard ?
how long was her body in the ground ?
you &apos;d expect to see that level of decomposition
if a body had been buried for between 6 to 12 months ,
depending on inclement weather ...
she &apos;ll be up for parole by the time we &apos;re done with this .
i can only let you do this for about five more minutes .
your lips are blue .
thanks .
what does paddy do for you to take this risk ?
it &apos;s what he doesn &apos;t do .
i got a brother on the inside .
i got six hits .
maura , can you see these photos ?
uh , yes . sorry .
is it one of these women ?
i don &apos;t know . i ...
susie , there are crime @-@ scene photos of the bones .
yeah , i have them right here .
the distance between the conical orbits ,
the size and symmetry of the nasal opening ,
the pronounced zygomatic bones ...
tick @-@ tock , tick @-@ tock .
well , i really need more comparable data , jane .
no , you really need to sleep in your own bed .
judging by the broad , round facial @-@ projection features ,
she &apos;s likely of african or south american descent .
i &apos;ll have to go with number five .
susie , what do you think ?
definitely number five .
sofia alvares , 23 .
brazilian swimsuit model .
missing 10 months .
got it -- we matched the print on the keypad
to brad adams .
so we can prove he was here .
but why would he want those bones ?
susie , i want to see
all the photographs of the bones .
csru didn &apos;t find all of her remains .
i know . it &apos;s a partial skeleton .
just show me the next photo .
stop right there .
go closer on the hyoid .
we need a cause of death .
well , it would be better if i could do an autopsy .
maura , popov will be here soon .
crushed hyoid bone .
could you show me brad &apos;s neck ?
it is so reckless to guess .
you &apos;re in jail . ask the guards .
they &apos;re not gonna add more time for guessing .
cause of death appears to be the same for both brad and sofia .
all right , well , that means we &apos;re looking for one killer .
so , he hired brad to hit on maura ,
break in here , and steal sofia &apos;s bones ?
yeah . no disrespect , maura , but why did our killer think
that you could tie him to sofia &apos;s murder ?
i don &apos;t know .
susie , were any more bones from the site delivered today ?
uh , yes , but they &apos;re just fragments .
i started laying them out .
isolate that small bone on the left .
describe it to me .
a fragment approximately 8 millimeters long ...
with an epiphyseal end .
it &apos;s not a bone fragment . it &apos;s a fetal clavicle .
she was pregnant ?
somewhere between eight and nine weeks .
that &apos;s what he was afraid of .
fetal dna would tie him to sofia .
because our killer is the father of her baby .
ok . thanks , susie .
susie was able to extract fetal dna from that fetal clavicle .
did she compare it to brad &apos;s dna ?
yeah . it &apos;s just like we thought .
we can rule brad out as the father .
we should run that dna through codis .
hey , korsak , you &apos;re gonna be glad
you didn &apos;t fall asleep in the break room .
look at this .
is that sofia ?
uh @-@ huh , and her supermodel pals .
wait . what club is that ?
hollow venom .
frankie said that brad worked there .
and there he is .
just established a connection between brad and sofia .
yeah , but we also confirmed cause of death for the both of them
wth the help of maura , who is also our suspect .
any chance dr . popov could come up with the same findings ?
please , the only thing i &apos;m certain popov will find
is some chilled vodka .
there &apos;s got to be something we can do
with all that equipment down there .
i can &apos;t .
it &apos;s a criminal violation ,
and it could ruin the evidence for court .
i &apos;m not asking you to cut him open .
i just want to get a look at his hyoid bone
to see if it was crushed like sofia &apos;s .
i mean , what about an x @-@ ray or an mri ?
that won &apos;t show you enough .
fine .
what about that fluoroscope thing ?
might work .
we can at least see
the tissue below the surface .
okay , that . that --
that &apos;s bruising , right ?
there &apos;s a distinctive subdural hematoma , yes .
the shape of that bruise doesn &apos;t look like
it would be caused by an elbow strike .
it &apos;s more consistent with the shape of a --
a closed fist .
that &apos;s weird . why are those bruises there ?
those three distinctive oval marks ?
i don &apos;t know what could leave marks like that .
all right , well , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s more than we had before .
maura would be very proud of you .
she &apos;s my hero .
so are you !
but she &apos;s an m.d.
we got a hit .
i think we just i.d. &apos; d sofia &apos;s baby daddy .
tucker franklin was the father of sofia &apos;s baby ?
yep , tucker franklin ,
famous golf pro and philanthropist .
crazy , right ?
nothing came up on codis ,
so we ran it through other dna databases .
tucker &apos;s dna was on file
with his bone @-@ marrow charity .
tucker introduced maura to brad .
because they knew each other .
look at this .
tucker going into a fancy club .
hollow venom again .
that &apos;s the same club sofia frequented .
and there &apos;s tucker with his bouncer friend , brad .
you know , frankie said brad was the guy
who hooked up celebrities with women and drugs .
looks like brad hooked tucker up with sofia ,
but sofia got in the family way .
the only way tucker holds on to his fat endorsement deals
and his marriage was to eliminate her .
once those bones surfaced ,
he knew it was just a matter of time
before maura identified sofia
and tied tucker &apos;s dna to their unborn baby .
but why did tucker kill brad ?
tucker didn &apos;t want to leave any witness .
you know , one good punch to the throat
with something to protect those soft hands .
we still don &apos;t have enough probable cause to arrest him .
we do have enough to question him , though .
look , it &apos;s tucker franklin !
park it up front , pal .
yo , tucker franklin , man !
tucker franklin !
would you look at that ?
i bet that would leave three distinct oval bruises .
hey , tucker .
do i know you ?
you know me well enough to take my $ 1,000 check
for your charity .
oh . well , thanks .
this is a nice keychain .
what are you doing with my keys ?
oh , i &apos;m not the valet .
you know , it makes sense
that you &apos;d want to protect that million @-@ dollar grip .
you can &apos;t use those soft hands to punch people .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
hell of a swing , too .
and with these brass knuckles , it would just take
one good punch to the throat to kill sofia ... and brad .
oh , my god .
guess we &apos;re gonna have to park that hummer in the impound lot .
tucker franklin , you &apos;re under arrest
for the murder of sofia alvares and brad adams .
thank you . thank you .
so many of you admire me ,
dr. vladimir popov , and my work .
leave it to popov .
excuse me .
girl .
i need this cold .
you sure know how to make an entrance .
i was thinking of wearing my neon orange jumpsuit ,
but i thought it &apos;d be too much .
yeah , you can wear it tomorrow .
so , did you get any new prison tats ?
none that i want to show you .
so , what do you want to do now ?
go to work .
okay .
welcome back .
thank you .
thank you .
