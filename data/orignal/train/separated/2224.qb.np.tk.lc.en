marian !
so , how do we break the spell ?
true love &apos;s kiss .
there &apos;s a reason that kiss didn &apos;t work .
i &apos;m in love with someone else .
she &apos;s still your wife .
soon i will have what i want .
a family that loves me .
the wall -- it &apos;s fallen .
we must leave now . the town will soon be overrun .
these books are too valuable to leave to those monsters .
my lady , please .
take these trunks to the carriage .
i &apos;ll be just behind you .
and your daughter ?
i will find her . now go .
darling , we must leave , quickly !
where are you ?
i &apos;m right here , mother !
i &apos;m sorry , but i couldn &apos;t leave without this .
it &apos;s the first story you ever read to me , remember ?
it &apos;s what made me fall in love with books .
of course i remember , my belle .
quickly , we must flee bef--
they &apos;re here .
we will hide till they pass .
ogres !
it &apos;s going to be all right .
mother ? !
m ...
belle , why aren &apos;t you in bed ?
what happened ? w @-@ where &apos;s mother ?
you mean ... you don &apos;t remember ?
remember what , father ? i ...
no .
rumple ?
belle .
hey , i &apos;ve been -- been looking all over the house for you .
didn &apos;t even hear you leave .
well , i didn &apos;t want to wake you .
just a few things to take care of before we open .
well , whatever it is , it &apos;ll have to wait .
emma called . she needs to see us right away .
give it back , kevin .
the camera is emma &apos;s , not yours .
emma , that &apos;s you . you must be --
13 , maybe 14 .
are you missing the part where she &apos;s with the snow queen ?
emma , you knew her before you came to storybrooke ?
apparently my run @-@ in with her in town
wasn &apos;t the only memory she erased .
all this time in this foster home ,
or whatever that place was -- it &apos;s gone .
look , i @-@ i just don &apos;t understand
how she even ended up in this world .
we were hoping gold could tell us that .
you spent more time trying to get here than anyone .
how the hell did she do it ?
considering the time i spent on the same task ,
i &apos;d love to know .
does it really matter how she got to emma ?
i mean , shouldn &apos;t we be more concerned about why ?
obviously , she needed her for something . but what ?
well , that &apos;s our next problem .
well , we know she &apos;s hiding somewhere in the north woods .
we combed every inch of her shop .
we tore apart her house .
she must have cleared everything out days before .
which means she must be hiding something .
but where ?
what about her ice @-@ cream truck ?
whoa , snow queen has an ice @-@ cream truck ?
i &apos;m a kid . i notice these kind of things .
then we split up into groups . we search the town , the woods .
hook , regina , emma , you take the west .
gold , you &apos;re with me for the east .
i think we all know i work best alone .
well , no time to argue that . belle , how are you at tracking ?
uh , actually , i @-@ i think i &apos;ll be more helpful at the library .
maybe i can dig something up on the snow queen .
i &apos;d like to come with you , belle , if that &apos;s okay .
maybe something about my sister will be there , too .
unless you &apos;d rather not have the company ?
no , n @-@ not at all . i would love some .
it &apos;s late .
you should be in bed .
how can i possibly sleep
when i can &apos;t even remember what happened to mother ?
perhaps that &apos;s for the best .
no !
i need to know what happened to her after i blacked out .
you won &apos;t find the answers you seek in the pages of a book .
but i already have , father .
according to this , there are creatures
who can restore memories that have been lost .
if we journey to them , maybe they can help me remember
what happened to mother .
i can &apos;t allow you to do that .
why not ?
because there &apos;s something this book doesn &apos;t tell you .
magic always comes with a price .
and whatever that price is ,
i don &apos;t want you to have to pay it .
i &apos;m sorry , belle ,
but i &apos;ve already lost your mother to this infernal ogres war .
i can &apos;t lose you , too .
but father -- - you heard me !
no , no !
forget this nonsense !
you are not to leave this chamber
until the doctors say you &apos;re better !
i &apos;m sorry , father ,
but i need to know what happened .
and this ...
is the only place where i &apos;ll find the answer .
arendelle .
there doesn &apos;t seem to be anything on arendelle here .
do you know where to look ?
no , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m really not that familiar with arendelle ,
o @-@ or -- or your sister .
elsa ?
anna !
oh , i was worried i &apos;d never see you again .
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re stuck with me .
i &apos;m sorry i left without telling you .
oh , and i &apos;m sorry i made you feel like you had to .
i know you did it for me , to try to make me feel better .
so , what did you learn ?
did you discover why our parents went to the enchanted forest ?
what is it , anna ? what did you find ?
nothing .
i mean , i &apos;m still waiting on some answers from a few people i met ,
but i wouldn &apos;t expect anything anytime soon
because they have to find it out ,
then get on a ship and come here .
it could take a while , a long while , and ...
wait , no flurries ?
no frost on the windows ?
usually a conversation about our parents ends
with a chill in the air .
i &apos;ve been learning to control my powers when i get upset .
really ? how ?
by training with me .
who is that ?
i mean , who are you ? i @-@ i mean ... hi .
she &apos;s our aunt .
our what ?
your aunt . my name is ingrid .
your mother and i were sisters .
you look exactly like her .
but our mother doesn &apos;t have a sister .
at least , she never told us about one .
i &apos;m sure it was too painful for her to talk about .
you see , many years ago ,
i was trapped in a magical urn by ...
people who didn &apos;t exactly understand me .
didn &apos;t understand you ?
our gift runs in the family .
i &apos;m telling you , that woman is up to something .
what , you mean your aunt ? what makes you think that ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s weird and strange , her being here .
and because i &apos;m a good judge of character .
yeah , says the girl who agreed to marry hans
10 minutes after you started talking to him .
i was young and naive .
you met me the next day .
young @-@ er .
anyway , i just want to make sure
we &apos;re asking all the right questions .
like what ?
like , is she really even my aunt ,
or is she just some imposter
trying to worm her way into our family ?
anna , look at her .
you can &apos;t see the resemblance ?
oh , yes , the ice @-@ power thing , there &apos;s that .
maybe , but if she &apos;s really my aunt ,
why isn &apos;t she in the family portraits , the royal records ?
there &apos;s no trace of her .
it &apos;s like she never even existed .
there has to be an explanation for all this .
yeah ? and how do you think you &apos;re gonna find it ?
your family .
careful .
grand pabbie &apos;s still a little miffed that you postponed the wedding .
i can handle grand pabbie .
will you go back to the castle and cover for me --
watch elsa while i &apos;m gone ?
if it &apos;ll put your mind at ease , of course .
oh , but , kristoff ,
you have to be careful what you say around her .
i ... might not --
i might not exactly have told her
what i discovered in the enchanted forest .
you lied to her ?
ohh , i didn &apos;t lie .
i just ... withheld the truth .
telling her our parents wanted to take away her magic ...
i just have to find the right moment .
that &apos;s all .
right , right . of course . yeah .
you know i &apos;ll support you no matter what .
unless i think it &apos;s really dumb .
then i &apos;ll tell you .
thank goodness i haven &apos;t hit &quot; really dumb &quot; yet .
can i get you supplies for your journey ?
you &apos;re sweet , but no .
i &apos;ll stop by oaken &apos;s on the way .
you &apos;ll see me as soon as i return .
david , call off the search party .
we found the truck near the merry men &apos;s camp .
thanks for keeping an eye out .
gladly .
you &apos;re the first sheriff i don &apos;t mind assisting .
uh , regina , i was hoping we could talk .
um , in case you haven &apos;t noticed ,
i &apos;m about to storm an evil ice @-@ cream truck .
you could have just said , &quot; maybe later . &quot;
i know you &apos;re trying to make everything better ,
but staying out of it is your best bet .
it &apos;s bad enough i &apos;m stuck with you and captain guy @-@ liner
making eyes at each other .
i don &apos;t make eyes .
ready , love ?
it appears she beat us to it .
she &apos;s cleared out the vessel .
what now ?
should we question the cows she gets her milk from ?
maybe search the waffle @-@ cone factory ?
hang on . look . who locks their freezer ?
was she afraid someone was gonna steal the rocky road ?
stand back .
looks like the dairy queen &apos;s been following me for a long time .
since before foster care ?
since i landed in this world .
are you okay ?
this is pointless .
i don &apos;t know why i thought i &apos;d find anything about anna in here .
you know she &apos;s somewhere . you know she &apos;s alive .
you heard her heartbeat with bo @-@ peep &apos;s staff , right ?
but if what the snow queen told me is true
and anna is the one who put me in that urn ,
then maybe she doesn &apos;t want me to find her .
that &apos;s not true , elsa .
you &apos;re just saying that to make me feel better .
no , i promise you , i &apos;m not .
how would you know what my sister thinks ?
you &apos;ve never even met her .
well , just from what you &apos;ve been saying ,
i @-@ i feel like i know her .
you two were very close .
something must have pulled you apart --
something beyond your control .
but my memories are gone ,
and no one in this town has even been to arendelle .
i need to face the truth , belle .
no one here can help me ,
and i &apos;m afraid that means i might never see anna again .
okay .
you will .
i know it .
now , keep looking . i &apos;ll be back .
what ? where are you going ?
there &apos;s something i @-@ i need to take care of .
we will find anna .
you want to find trolls ?
you know they &apos;re dangerous , yeah ?
oh , no , no , no . rock trolls , not bridge trolls .
oh , yeah , they &apos;re quite nice .
so , you can -- you can direct me to them ?
no . i &apos;ve never met them .
but y @-@ you just said they were nice .
i &apos;ve heard .
please help me . i @-@ i just lost my mother .
oh , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m so sorry .
uh , trolls can &apos;t bring life .
but i can help soothe you .
have you tried the sauna ?
uh , no , no . thank you .
need some help ?
uh , well , i was trying to find my way to the rock trolls ,
but this map is not being too helpful .
oaken means well .
yeah !
but you don &apos;t need him or a map .
i can help you .
i &apos;m on my way to see them . come with me .
really ?
thank you .
uh , i &apos;m belle .
i &apos;m anna .
friend of anna &apos;s ? half price on the sauna .
i can &apos;t help but think you &apos;re avoiding me .
well , not very well , it seems .
you &apos;re upset because of what i said --
that i &apos;m still in love with you .
i suppose i should never have told you ,
not after i asked you to find a way to save my wife .
that &apos;s not why i &apos;m avoiding you .
then why can &apos;t you even look me in the eye ?
because i don &apos;t know how to tell you the truth .
you know you can tell me anything .
i &apos;ve read every spell book in my possession ,
experimented with every potion in my vault .
i even tried to defeat the snow queen
so i could force her to reverse the spell . but ...
nothing i do seems good enough .
but it will be , regina . i have faith in you .
you will figure out a way eventually .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to tell you .
i &apos;m not sure i can figure it out .
robin , i &apos;m sorry ,
but if you truly want to save marian ...
you &apos;re gonna have to forget about me ...
and ... find a way ...
to fall in love with your wife again .
you can show yourself , dearie .
i &apos;m not the one you &apos;re hiding from .
no , you &apos;re not .
to what do i owe this intrusion ?
a warning .
emma swan is onto you .
she knows your history began long before you came to storybrooke .
i &apos;m aware .
do you really think she would have discovered that
if i hadn &apos;t wanted her to ?
it &apos;s all part of my plan --
a plan you thankfully know little about .
you &apos;re being awfully secretive .
you didn &apos;t come to warn me .
you came to find out my secrets .
or offer up a deal . whatever suits you best .
but if you decline , i &apos;d be careful .
there it is .
there &apos;s the warning .
you want something out of me ?
why don &apos;t you just ask for it ?
if i wanted something out of you , dearie ,
believe me , i &apos;d take it .
but you can &apos;t , can you ? otherwise you would .
you and i both know -- to get what you want ,
you need one thing that i have and you &apos;re sorely lacking --
leverage .
and until you get that ...
i have a warning for you .
stay out of my way .
don &apos;t worry , anna . i &apos;ll find you .
so , belle ...
i couldn &apos;t help overhearing --
well , actually , i could , but i &apos;m naturally curious .
anyway ... i heard you lost your mother .
yes , in the -- in the ogres war .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i lost mine , too .
there are no words .
no , there aren &apos;t ,
especially when you don &apos;t know what happened .
i was hoping the rock trolls could restore my memory
so that i can finally be at peace .
sometimes the answer isn &apos;t what you want .
which is what ?
one that makes you feel better .
but if grand pabbie can help you get what you need ,
i &apos;ll make sure he does .
thank you .
so , now what ?
now we climb .
okay .
okay .
you okay ?
kristoff makes this look easy !
here .
careful ! careful .
why ? w @-@ what &apos;s inside ?
a hat which can strip the magic
from the most powerful of sorcerers .
why do you have such a thing ?
i sort of stole it from an evil sorcerer
when i was back in the enchanted forest .
i went to him to help with my sister ,
but things didn &apos;t exactly go according to plan .
why ? what -- what happened ?
who -- who is this person ?
i @-@ i &apos;d really rather not get into it .
the less you know , the better .
i just pray you never cross paths with that twisted man .
belle .
where are you headed ?
to the north woods , where the snow queen &apos;s hiding .
and what business do you have with her ?
i have to fix a mistake that i made a long time ago .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t tell you . you wouldn &apos;t understand .
whether or not that &apos;s true ,
the fact remains that she defeated both emma and regina .
she is far more dangerous than you realize .
i know .
that &apos;s why i was -- i was hoping you &apos;d come with me .
i &apos;m sorry , belle . that &apos;s out of the question .
i won &apos;t let you anywhere near her .
i was worried you were gonna say that .
because ... i really ...
really didn &apos;t want to do this .
bell , i gave you that dagger because i trusted you ...
... because i thought you would never want to control me .
i know . i know , and i &apos;m so , so sorry , rumple .
but if you won &apos;t come with me willingly ,
what choice do i have ?
take me to the snow queen .
according to this , she was my foster parent for six months .
aye ?
that &apos;s the longest i was ever in one spot ,
but i don &apos;t remember a second of it .
you all right , swan ?
i &apos;m fine . it was all a long time ago .
mm , perhaps , but wounds that are made
when we &apos;re young tend to linger .
how would you know ?
believe it or not , i was once a child .
yeah , like a million years ago .
it was more like 200 .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a painting i did when i was in school .
that &apos;s so surprising ?
it &apos;s not the only one .
this crazy woman has a whole file of my old art projects and essays .
just like the one i have for henry .
you don &apos;t keep stuff like this
unless you care about someone .
well , perhaps the snow queen wasn &apos;t simply using you .
perhaps she &apos;d grown fond of you over time .
looks like the feeling was mutual .
&quot; thanks for being the family i never had .
love , emma . &quot;
i wrote that to her .
looks like you two were close once .
but she still erased my memories .
something must have happened to change all that .
there has to be a clue as to why .
perhaps there is ... if you can read hieroglyphs .
this isn &apos;t from our world .
what the hell was she doing with me ?
this is it ?
this is where she &apos;s hiding ?
indeed . but she &apos;s not at home .
i don &apos;t sense her magic .
good .
okay . you stay here as lookout . i &apos;m going in .
no , belle , y @-@ you &apos;re not going in there alone .
look , i won &apos;t be long . i just need to find something .
what could you possibly want from the snow queen &apos;s cave ?
a hat --
one that can strip a magical being of their powers .
that sounds like a remarkable object --
almost too good to be true , which means it probably is .
it isn &apos;t , and i know she has it ,
and i need to get it from her .
it &apos;s the only way to force her to tell us where anna is .
so this is about elsa &apos;s sister ?
why are you so invested in a girl you &apos;ve never even met ?
because a hero always helps strangers .
now keep watch .
i &apos;ll call out to you if i need your help .
grand pabbie ?
grand pabbie , it &apos;s me !
ooh , anna , my dear , you &apos;re back !
have you come to tell us the new wedding date ?
i have been working on my speech .
not yet , but we can get into that later .
first , i want you to meet my friend belle .
she &apos;s come a long way to see you .
it &apos;s an honor to meet you .
i &apos;m , uh -- i &apos;m here because i @-@ i --
i know .
i can help you get the memories of your mother .
take this to the place where you lost your memory ,
then brew a tea with the stone in the kettle .
when you drink it , your memories will return .
thank you .
thank you , anna . i @-@ i owe you , as well .
how can i repay you ?
you don &apos;t have to .
having a new friend is payment enough .
all i need is a moment alone with pabbie .
i &apos;ll be quick .
what can i help you with , dear ?
some woman claims to be my aunt .
i just don &apos;t believe her !
mother would have told us if she had a sister .
actually , she had two sisters .
wait . what ?
mother had two sisters that she never spoke about ?
why didn &apos;t she say anything ?
why didn &apos;t you say anything ?
because i was sworn to secrecy .
grand pabbie , i need some answers .
please .
your mother , gerda , was the youngest of three .
and then there was helga , and ingrid was the oldest .
as children , the three girls were quite close ,
often seen playing together in the royal gardens .
but then , one day , helga and ingrid vanished .
no one ever knew what happened to them .
it was a tragedy the royal family wanted to forget .
and they did , with my help .
you took the memories of everyone in arendelle ?
yes .
and the royal family erased mention of helga
and ingrid from every book and record
they could find in our realm .
why wouldn &apos;t ingrid tell me what happened ,
or that she had another sister ?
those are questions you &apos;d have to ask your aunt .
like she would tell me .
if she &apos;s keeping these secrets ,
who knows what else she &apos;s hiding .
i have to warn elsa .
belle , we have to go !
what ? is everything okay ?
i don &apos;t think so .
it &apos;s my aunt . she &apos;s up to something .
the hat must be in here somewhere .
belle .
belle . belle !
over here , belle .
over here , belle .
over ... here .
hello , belle !
i was hoping you &apos;d find me .
i wish i didn &apos;t have to wait to use this .
you &apos;ll be home real soon .
as soon as we get into town , we &apos;ll put you on the first ship
back to the enchanted forest .
if any ships are even setting sail . it ...
looks like a storm &apos;s setting in .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a storm .
well , what else could it be ?
my aunt .
i don &apos;t think my aunt wants me to tell my sister what i found out .
well , if she ... has all this magic and --
and you have , well , g @-@ good intentions ,
then what are we gonna do ?
i have more than good intentions !
i have this !
she can &apos;t hurt us if she doesn &apos;t have magic .
belle !
belle !
i can &apos;t pull myself up !
just hold on ! i &apos;ll be right there !
belle , hurry ! please !
belle , hurry !
i &apos;m coming !
i &apos;m coming .
anna !
leave her alone !
you &apos;ll have to excuse us ,
but this is family business .
i &apos;m surprised you were brave enough to come in here .
i had to .
i have to find a way to help anna .
why ?
you never really cared much for her before .
that &apos;s not true .
sure , it is . you chose that rock over her .
you had to remember what happened to your mother ,
no matter what the cost .
i made a mistake .
i didn &apos;t mean to ...
ruin someone &apos;s life ?
it certainly wasn &apos;t your most heroic moment .
not that you &apos;ve ever really been hero material .
no , please ... please stop .
everyone sees you for what you really are , belle --
a pathetic coward .
i mean , why do you think the dark one married you ?
you think it was love ?
he needed someone weak , someone he could manipulate .
that &apos;s not true . he loves me . he gave me this .
you truly believe that &apos;s real ?
deep down ,
you know what kind of beast you &apos;re dealing with .
belle ! belle .
the snow queen &apos;s approaching the cave .
belle .
look at me .
don &apos;t look in the mirror . look at me .
we have to leave .
no .
let me go .
you don &apos;t know what you are doing .
no .
let me go !
let -- let me go ! - we &apos;re back in the shop .
we &apos;re back in the shop . it &apos;s okay .
no , no !
it &apos;s okay .
wait . no .
you were outside the cave .
i commanded that you wait there .
you commanded me to keep watch .
i sensed she was coming back .
i came to find you , and i &apos;m glad i did .
i ... i hurt you .
i ...
i &apos;m so sorry , rumple .
it &apos;s okay .
when i f @-@ found that mirror , something came over me ,
like a -- like a spell .
and -- and it spoke to me and made me --
made me believe all these horrible things ,
and it said to me that
the dagger you gave me is fake .
i can assure you that nothing that mirror said is true .
it was imbued with the darkest of magic .
i @-@ i know you would never wrong me .
i have wronged you .
i &apos;ve kept a terrible secret from you .
i &apos;m the reason ... that anna &apos;s missing .
i didn &apos;t want anyone to know
until i could make things right and save anna .
but i couldn &apos;t . i failed .
and all i managed to do was abuse the dagger
and -- and take advantage of you , my true love .
i @-@ i don &apos;t even know if i --
if i deserve to be with you anymore .
no , no , no . you were only doing what you thought was right .
you -- you forgive me ?
of course i forgive you .
thank you for telling me everything .
thank you for understanding .
i never should have kept a secret from you ,
especially &apos; cause i know that you &apos;d never keep one from me .
i love you , rumple .
and i love you , too .
father , i ...
i @-@ i thought you &apos;d be asleep .
i haven &apos;t slept in days .
how could i when you left without so much as a goodbye ?
so , did you find what you were looking for ?
no .
you were right , father .
i should have just left things alone .
that trip was a huge mistake .
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s made the mistake , belle .
i &apos;ve been keeping a secret from you .
i know what happened during the ogre attack .
wait , what ? !
i didn &apos;t want to add to your grief .
when the ogres stormed the library
where you and your mother had been working ,
the guards heard the commotion .
they rushed in . they saw the ogres were about to attack .
but your mother , she --
she stood in the path of those monsters to protect you .
she kept them at bay
while the guards pulled you from danger .
but by the time they came to save your mother ...
it was too late .
she sacrificed herself for me .
she loved you so much , and so do i.
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re back .
i don &apos;t know what i would have done
if the ogres had gotten you on the road .
they -- they have reached the roads ?
the war is not going well .
but you need not worry of such things .
we have soldiers to fight .
but those soldiers don &apos;t stand a chance .
they &apos;ll only slow down the ogres &apos; advance .
we need someone who can stop them once and for all .
and who would that be ?
on my journey , i did some reading .
and , well ...
there &apos;s a wizard , a powerful , powerful wizard ,
who may just help us .
his name is --
i know his name !
and i dare not speak it .
trust me , belle , if we do --
i know . magic always comes with a price .
but if mother &apos;s death taught me anything ,
it &apos;s that sometimes a hero has to sacrifice everything
to save the people they love ,
and i will do whatever i can to save our land .
and i can be a hero , just like mother .
and if that means summoning rumplestiltskin ...
then so be it .
i &apos;m afraid we have a problem , dearie .
i caught a glimpse of your mirror today .
it &apos;s rather impressive , isn &apos;t it ?
i had no idea your bride would be so easy to turn .
watch yourself .
now , i don &apos;t know exactly when you intend to use this mirror ,
but you should know this .
i won &apos;t allow you to hurt those i care about .
and i won &apos;t allow you to derail my plans
because you &apos;ve suddenly gotten sentimental .
you only get one warning .
which is more than you get .
i can &apos;t make any promises
over who may or who may not survive .
you know , you were wrong before .
that you needed leverage to get what you want ?
no , that i didn &apos;t have it .
i do .
where did you get that ?
oh , that &apos;s irrelevant .
but now that i know what you &apos;re up to ,
we can have a real talk .
you might want to reconsider your position ,
because i doubt you &apos;d enjoy
becoming just another embroidery on this hat .
looks like you &apos;ve just lost your leverage , dearie .
anna .
it &apos;s time to wake up , dear .
what ?
where am i ?
exactly where you belong .
you can &apos;t just lock me in here !
elsa won &apos;t stand for it !
even when she finds out what you were planning to do to her ?
wait . what ?
you were planning to use this to strip away her magic .
no , that &apos;s not why i had it .
really ? then why didn &apos;t you tell elsa about it ?
because i @-@ i didn &apos;t know how to tell her the truth .
i found it with a man that our parents sought out .
they went to him looking for a way
to strip elsa of the thing that makes her special .
and you &apos;re following in their footsteps .
i wasn &apos;t going to use it on her .
i wasn &apos;t going to use it on anybody ...
until you attacked me .
the rock trolls told me what you &apos;ve been hiding ,
that you and my mother had another sister .
the rock trolls shouldn &apos;t talk about things
that they don &apos;t understand .
but it &apos;s true .
what happened to her ?
some secrets are better left buried .
i don &apos;t understand .
what do you want ? !
what i have always wanted ...
... a family who will embrace me for who i am .
for a brief moment ,
i thought the three of us could be that family --
you , me , and elsa .
but you showed me that plan would never work .
you have nothing in common with elsa and me .
you are the odd woman out .
and now i suppose i have to find someone else to take your place .
the snow queen is your aunt ?
according to this heraldry book i found in the library .
her name is ingrid .
i didn &apos;t even know my mother had any sisters .
i &apos;m as surprised as you are .
well , spend a little more time in this town , love ,
you &apos;ll realize just about everyone &apos;s related .
this book traces the lineage in arendelle for generations .
that &apos;s gerda , my mother .
and this is helga , my other aunt .
bloody hell .
look at this one -- she looks just like you .
maybe that &apos;s why she was so obsessed with you ,
why she kept all those relics from your childhood .
she came to this world looking for blondes ?
there &apos;s a lot more than just me .
don &apos;t i know it .
she wasn &apos;t looking for a blonde .
she was looking for the savior .
what ?
this scroll -- the writing is runic . it &apos;s a prophecy .
it says , &quot; the name of the savior is emma . &quot;
she knew ?
before you even did . she knew you were powerful .
but why ?
it says it right here ...
&quot; and the savior shall become ingrid &apos;s sister . &quot;
what the hell does that mean ?
well , my mother died , and her other sister , she &apos;s not around anymore .
i think ingrid believes in this prophecy .
i think she &apos;s looking to replace them .
elsa .
yes .
i -- i &apos;m sorry .
i am so , so sorry , but ...
what ?
... i @-@ i &apos;ve been keeping a secret .
i know your sister , anna . she helped me once .
but when i had a chance to help her , i let her down .
and because i did ,
she was captured by the snow queen .
what ? where did this happen ? when ?
arendelle ... a long , long time ago .
and i have no idea where she is now .
but , uh , i &apos;m afraid we have a more pressing concern .
the snow queen has a mirror imbued with terrible magic
that can do terrible things .
mirror ? easy enough , let &apos;s just go smash it .
it &apos;s not that simple .
rumple told me it &apos;s part of an awful spell --
the spell of shattered sight .
if she casts it ,
its magic will make everyone in storybrooke
turn on one another .
bloody hell .
the entire town will destroy itself .
and there &apos;d be no one left .
except us .
what makes you think that she &apos;d spare you and elsa ?
because of this .
she wants to be just three of us .
