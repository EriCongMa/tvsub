they &apos;d killed him with my spare firearm .
i realized i &apos;d been set up .
all the information i found on the others since james &apos; arrest .
ellen had access to the 50th floor
of the empire state building while it was under renovation .
you think she planted it there ?
senator terrence pratt .
he &apos;s got to be one of the dirty cops ellen was investigating .
he &apos;s the one .
be careful , peter . he can hurt you .
i don &apos;t have brakes .
your division at the fbi is undergoing restructuring
as of today .
amanda callaway .
she &apos;s replacing hughes ?
she closed the case against pratt .
she &apos;s got to be in his pocket .
we found the evidence box
on the southwest side of the ceiling .
you found it .
hi , senator .
i think i know where they &apos;re looking .
got something for us .
looks just like it .
figured you &apos;d keep your anklet away
from that one for a while , huh ?
at least until we go after the box ,
which should be about here -- the 50th floor .
mm . this is where it all ends .
or begins .
no more running , no more hiding .
you know how to get it ?
well , pratt doesn &apos;t know where it is .
so we take our time , do it right .
okay .
is that frown a family thing ?
oh , you recognize this look , do you ?
occasionally .
hey , you know , you inherited your old man &apos;s impatience .
you just got a little bit more self @-@ control .
okay .
what else did i get from my old man ?
well , you got my height ...
my extraordinary good looks .
everybody said you got my eyes .
when i was 5,
mom told me that you were the blue in my eyes .
and i &apos;d run upstairs
and crawl right up next to the bathroom mirror
and look so hard for you .
you know , i just realized why you want that box so bad .
oh , yeah , detective bennett ?
why is that ?
you think that what &apos;s in there will tell you who i am .
and if it does ?
then you will finally know who you are .
you know , you &apos;re not me , neal .
no .
but you are the blue in my eyes .
don &apos;t forget the extraordinary good looks .
we &apos;re gonna find it .
i know .
so , everyone with a life has gone home .
everyone with a wife should have .
she must be a very understanding woman .
that &apos;s the understatement of the year .
what can i do for you , agent callaway ?
let &apos;s talk about senator pratt .
i have this habit
where i like to give every case a good once @-@ over
before putting it to bed .
that &apos;s why i called him .
he told me a very interesting story
about a man named james bennett .
he &apos;s a convicted cop killer ,
and it turns out he &apos;s also the father of your c.i.
james is neal &apos;s dad , yes .
he told me another very interesting story --
now , stop me if you &apos;ve heard this one --
about james bennett &apos;s
late partner , ellen parker .
as it turns out , she was amassing evidence against him .
against pratt ?
no . against james .
pratt &apos;s lying .
she was like family to him .
and what pratt didn &apos;t tell you is that the evidence in the box
implicated pratt , not james .
so that &apos;s what caffrey and his father are looking for
in the empire state building .
i want that thing first .
so does pratt .
but he &apos;s not gonna get it .
if this evidence is so important to both men ,
i want the bureau to have it first ,
and then we &apos;ll see who &apos;s telling the truth .
are you up for getting together a search team ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;ll put my plan in place .
we &apos;ll brief the team first thing in the a.m.
excellent . i &apos;ll handle the warrants .
honey , what is it ?
this can &apos;t be good .
i got to go .
it &apos;s so early .
i know . go back to sleep .
i thought one of the perks of retirement was sleeping in late .
they say that men who retire early
have an 80 % greater chance of dying young ,
so you &apos;ll excuse me for not taking it easy just yet .
what &apos;s going on ?
they forced me out , peter .
i know .
well , i decided i was not gonna go gently into that good night .
i &apos;ve been in this business for 30 years ,
and i &apos;ve made a few friends .
what are your friends telling you ?
your instincts are right about pratt .
you and callaway spoke last night .
how do you know ?
some of those friends are at the nsa .
this is a phone call
recorded at 11 : 57 last night ,
placed from callaway &apos;s office .
tapping the bureau . reese ...
listen .
i spoke to burke , and he confirmed what you said ,
but he offered an interesting twist on the story .
as i said he would .
i also found what they &apos;re looking for .
the evidence is in a box .
a box ?
i &apos;ll be there in the morning .
pratt booked a train in from d.c.
he &apos;ll be here in a few hours .
and callaway is in his pocket .
it doesn &apos;t matter at this point .
pratt is dirty , peter .
now , to take him down ,
you got to get to the evidence first , before callaway .
that &apos;s gonna be a problem .
we &apos;re sending agents into the empire state building
to do a sweep .
i know .
i heard the whole conversation .
how do i keep her away from it ?
how bad do you want him ?
he tried to kill me , reese .
well , then , do it the way you &apos;ve been doing things
for the past few years .
use caffrey . do whatever you have to do .
i can &apos;t go outside the law .
you are the law , peter .
pratt and callaway are standing in the way of justice .
fight back .
you always told me working with caffrey
would put me dangerously close to the line .
sometimes you have to redraw those lines to stay within them .
hey , neal , you awake ?
what are you doing here so early ?
guess you didn &apos;t get peter &apos;s call .
uh , no . i was sleeping .
what &apos;s going on ?
he didn &apos;t get into specifics .
just said we ought to meet here right away .
didn &apos;t know you had company .
i &apos;ve got company .
i &apos;m neal &apos;s dad . you must be kate .
oh , uh , neal ?
i haven &apos;t told him everything .
oh , sorry . alex .
dad !
it &apos;s sara .
the insurance investigator .
he shoots , he scores .
i should &apos;ve brought more coffee .
are more people coming ?
greetings , fellow conspirators .
of course .
who called sara ?
no one called me .
well , here , take this .
it &apos;s too late for caffeine .
oh , good , you &apos;re all here .
who called sara ?
okay , how is it possible that three grown men
don &apos;t understand what &apos;s going on here ?
yeah .
i &apos;ve sent my stuff to london , so i &apos;ve been staying here .
we have a meeting . it &apos;s urgent .
sorry .
it &apos;s ... you know what ? it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m gonna go get adjusted to u.k.time.
you want me to bring you some , uh--
no .
can we get started ?
listen , whatever plan you concocted
to get the evidence box--
we don &apos;t have a plan .
well , you better get one .
why ?
two hours from now , an fbi team
will be heading into the empire state building ,
and they won &apos;t leave until they find that evidence box .
we need to find it first .
you told callaway about the box ?
that means pratt knows , too .
now , what matters is that she doesn &apos;t know what floor it &apos;s on .
now , i &apos;m heading the fbi team .
i can control the pace .
how long will it take you to get the box ?
you really don &apos;t have a plan .
well , we thought we had time .
we don &apos;t .
pratt &apos;s already in manhattan by now .
he told callaway a different version
of what we &apos;re gonna find .
what did he say ?
that it will implicate james .
he &apos;s a lying son of a bitch .
there &apos;s nothing in that box that &apos;ll implicate me .
we &apos;ll get there first .
i brief my team as soon as i leave .
what about me ?
you &apos;re benched .
perfect . let &apos;s make a plan .
any sign of pratt ?
no .
callaway &apos;s been in her office
with some of the techs since she got here .
they &apos;re excited about something in there .
i &apos;m making you two team leaders .
report only to me .
business as usual .
after you .
thank you for coming in early , everyone .
yeah , we got a manhunt on our hands ?
no , we &apos;re executing a search warrant
on the empire state building .
our target is a strongbox , 12x12x6 .
oh , that &apos;s a small target .
in a big building .
standard grid progression .
each of you will lead a team of seven agents .
we will be thorough on this .
now , we start with the ground floor .
actually , there &apos;s been some new intel
that &apos;s narrowed our search to floors 33 through 61 .
that makes 28 floors instead of 103 .
great .
which is good , this is an iconic building ,
and it will remain open during our search .
the warrant gives us two days .
that means we need to clear a floor every two hours .
correct . we will work systematically .
this operation will go &apos; round the clock .
also , i do not want any mistakes made with the chain of evidence .
that &apos;s right .
if you find the box , do not touch it or its contents .
notify me or agent callaway immediately .
understood ?
yeah .
debrief your teams . we roll in 30 .
peter , where &apos;s caffrey ?
home . i told him to sit this one out .
how &apos;d he take it ?
not well .
all right , our box is on 50 .
if we can get to it ,
how do we get it out of the building ?
you know , thousands of tourists
go in and out of this building every day .
i say we just grab it and walk it right out the front door .
the bureau will have agents everywhere .
no window washers , trash chutes ,
no base jumping .
i know .
so , what do we do ?
drink more champagne .
it improves cognition .
that &apos;s a proven fact .
mozzie , you may be onto something .
of course i am .
what exactly am i onto ?
all right , listen up .
over the next 48 hours ,
we will search this building and recover the evidence box .
some of you are dressed in green peeps uniforms .
the company was hired to conduct an environmental makeover on the building .
everyone , keep a close eye on your displays .
they &apos;re set to detect the i.r. signature of the box .
thank you , agent burke .
all right , people , we &apos;re on the clock .
double @-@ check their work , make sure they &apos;re thorough .
you want us to slow them down .
we can do that .
great .
hey , callaway &apos;s doubled her task force .
with this many agents ,
they &apos;ll clear the floors in less than two hours .
means they &apos;ll reach the box in a day and a half .
yeah , and in addition to plain clothes ,
she &apos;s got agents in green peeps uniforms .
great .
that helps us out with the last piece of our plan .
got to go .
this better work .
it will .
it &apos;s crazy . you know that .
don &apos;t worry . we specialize in crazy .
the champagne stand is coming along .
yep . how &apos;d you do ?
well , i found a home for our gas supply .
this beauty is rated at 3,000 psi .
nice .
any updates ?
yeah , the 51st floor is still available for lease ,
so our best option is to go in from above .
perfect .
well , to help us get through any concrete , i got this .
six ounces of hydrogen fluoride .
this stuff is nasty .
it &apos;ll melt its way through bones .
or anything .
acid .
quick , silent , efficient . that &apos;s good .
what &apos;s your entry plan ?
phase one -- caterers . simple .
white shirts , black pants .
that &apos;ll get us straight through into the building &apos;s restaurant .
then phase two .
i lifted these off the green peeps laundry truck .
fit right in with the fbi .
once the champagne stand is in place ,
we put on the greens , and we head upstairs .
we get the box , and i deliver it to you .
no . i &apos;ll bring it up .
i &apos;ve been chasing this evidence for too long .
i &apos;m not letting it get away .
sure . no problem .
that covers us . what about you ?
i will be on the 103rd @-@ floor balcony .
the 103rd ?
the empire state doesn &apos;t let just anyone up there .
celebrities , mostly .
too late to become a sports star ?
regrettably .
but there is another way .
that means ...
sara ?
you think she &apos;ll go along with this ?
she has an adventurous spirit .
you can &apos;t show up empty @-@ handed .
june said she &apos;d help me out .
well , then , we &apos;re all set .
see you in an hour ?
as soon as i &apos;m in that lobby , it &apos;s a go .
you sure about this ?
of course . you know me .
if you &apos;re gonna do something , do it right .
you &apos;re the best .
all right , here &apos;s bugsy .
thanks , buddy .
see you at home .
see you at home .
moz , good news .
one phone call to sara , and i &apos;m on my way .
bad news -- the feds are already up to 35 .
that &apos;s faster than peter expected .
it gets worse .
someone rented the 51st floor this morning .
well , talk to them . try to cut a deal .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;ll go for it .
why not ?
because i think we &apos;re the reason senator pratt is moving in .
so pratt has no idea he &apos;s sitting on top of the evidence ?
well , leasing office said he looked at three other floors
before he took the 51st .
it &apos;s the only one who would let him move in immediately .
that &apos;s risky play for a public figure .
less risky when you lease it through your private foundation .
i had jones do some recon .
pratt has installed some very high @-@ tech security .
proximity card keys . those are tough to beat .
as far as i can tell , he has the only one .
mozzie has a cloner .
that &apos;s good .
what ?
nothing .
this . us .
corrupt senators , fbi moles ...
well , no u @-@ boats this time , so ...
well , empire state building has a big boiler room .
peter , i don &apos;t know how to thank you for all this .
oh , look , it &apos;s about justice .
it always has been , from kate to the evidence box ,
i &apos;d do it all again in a heartbeat .
plus , he &apos;s your family .
family doesn &apos;t show up on your doorstep after 30 years .
they &apos;re the ones who &apos;ve been there when you need them .
i should see about that cloner .
keep me posted if anything happens .
well , you do the same .
hey , be safe tomorrow .
it &apos;s me .
it &apos;ll never end , will it ?
plan &apos;s in place . we &apos;re almost there .
don &apos;t say it . you &apos;ll jinx it .
elizabeth burke , have i told you lately
that i &apos;m the luckiest man on earth ?
i know . i should get a crown .
how about dinner instead ?
don &apos;t promise something you can &apos;t keep .
tomorrow afternoon , i &apos;ll be slapping cuffs on pratt .
and tomorrow evening , i &apos;ll be celebrating with you .
restaurant of my choice ?
even if it &apos;s sushi .
i &apos;m gonna make reservations .
good morning .
breakfast in bed .
no , no .
you &apos;re the cook in this coupling .
i just boil water .
you &apos;re gonna make a mean cup of tea .
well , you &apos;ll have to come visit me in london and find out .
well , i would love to , but , uh ...
yeah .
you &apos;re not gonna get that thing off anytime soon
if your friend keeps leaving treats at your door .
treats ?
there &apos;s a note .
from mozzie , i assume .
&quot; how close ? &quot; what does that mean ?
this is a proximity @-@ card cloner .
that &apos;s sexy . is it part of your master plan ?
yeah , it is .
here , you take the card key .
and i &apos;ll take these receivers and this .
now all i have to do is be in your proximity for around 30 seconds ,
and your key becomes mine .
a lot can happen in 30 seconds .
how close do you have to be ?
that &apos;s what i need to find out .
so i have something you want ,
but i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking ,
so what happens if i move ?
i follow you .
well , you can only follow me for so long
before someone catches on .
then i find a reason to keep you close .
if you get caught , you &apos;re gonna have to run .
perhaps the next isle you choose will be england .
the crown jewels are tempting .
if it weren &apos;t for your job --
or the ones you &apos;ve pulled ...
come on , you leave tonight .
let &apos;s not talk about that .
time &apos;s up .
we made it work .
while we could .
agent burke , what &apos;s going on with this wall ?
it was scanned 20 minutes ago .
i &apos;ve instructed my agents to double @-@ check .
okay , look , if a scanned surface comes up with nothing ,
we move on . that &apos;s protocol .
and what &apos;s the protocol
when the senator involved in the case
moves in two floors above us ?
okay , burke , i have put in a request with the bureau
to have pratt moved out , but until then ,
he is a private citizen who is leasing an office
for his charitable foundation ,
and booting him out is a tough sell .
you got to trust the system , agent .
i wish i could .
sara ?
she &apos;s in .
and mozzie trailed pratt to the park .
you okay ?
i &apos;ve tried to distance myself from pratt for years .
now i got to get close enough to kiss him .
yeah , well , as long as you don &apos;t kill him , we &apos;re good .
where &apos;s mozzie gonna be with the monitor ?
he &apos;ll be close by . make sure you got eye contact .
hit me up with the signals again .
he shakes his head &quot; no , i &apos;m not close enough . &quot;
this means &quot; keep going , it &apos;s working . &quot;
this is &quot; we got it . &quot;
been a long time , terry .
come here to shoot me ?
you &apos;d be dead if i were .
we &apos;ve got some catching up to do .
you know , i figured you &apos;d come to me at some point .
you clean up nice .
still , i don &apos;t think this is the man you want to emulate , neal .
too late .
last time i saw you ,
you were disgracing a police captain &apos;s uniform .
now i &apos;m wearing $ 3,000 suits . go figure .
time &apos;s been good to one of us .
well , nothing can change the fact
that you &apos;re still a piece of garbage .
you &apos;ve always made bad decisions , jimmy .
sitting down on this bench is one more .
we have an offer for you .
you &apos;re gonna want to hear it .
prison made you brave .
you have no idea what prison did to me .
you gonna relax while your son makes his offer to me ?
i &apos;m gonna relax when he &apos;s done .
talk .
we all want the same thing .
stop the box from controlling our lives .
we propose we get the evidence together .
you destroy what you need , we destroy what we need .
and in exchange ?
you take the bull &apos;s @-@ eye off my father .
really ?
why don &apos;t you just tell me where the box is ,
and i promise i &apos;ll play nice ?
my apologies if i don &apos;t trust a word you say .
then my apologies , as well .
i hold the cards .
you &apos;ve got nothing . no deal .
you &apos;re not gonna get away with this .
you took away 30 years of my life ,
and i &apos;m taking back 30 of yours .
you know , i was hoping
you &apos;d do something as stupid as assaulting a u.s. senator .
yet another bad decision that &apos;s gonna have you
leaving here in cuffs .
move away from the senator .
you think this is assault ?
that was assault .
big mistake , jimmy !
big mistake .
this floor is clear . we &apos;re moving up .
we &apos;re moving up to 50 .
we &apos;re moving way too fast .
neal &apos;s not even here yet .
between us , we can make sure it takes the full two hours .
good . do it .
neal , james , and mozzie are gonna be
entering the building any minute now .
we &apos;ve got to figure out a way to keep callaway distracted .
listen up , everybody . i need your full attention .
this man is james bennett .
he and his son , neal caffrey ,
are wanted for an assault on senator terrence pratt .
if you see either one of them in the building ,
arrest them on sight .
leave a message , and i &apos;ll get back to you when i can .
neal , i hope you get this .
do not enter the building .
we &apos;ve got eyes on caffrey in the lobby .
come on .
why are there agents all over the lobby ?
come with me .
pratt &apos;s claiming you and your father assaulted him .
well , we had to improvise .
they &apos;re looking for you and james ,
which means right now , callaway &apos;s tracking your anklet .
well , i still need to get up to the observation deck .
that &apos;s not gonna be easy if she &apos;s watching my every move .
you ready ?
as i &apos;ll ever be . how about you ?
if this works , i can answer for all of it .
if not ...
we need it to work .
yeah .
plus , i promised el i &apos;d take her to dinner tonight .
then i &apos;d better hurry .
sara &apos;s waiting for me .
it &apos;s beautiful up here .
ready to give these people a show ?
yeah .
cold feet , caffrey ?
no . no . you ?
absolutely not .
all right .
here goes nothing .
okay , people are starting to watch us .
i think you &apos;re supposed to say something .
yeah , yeah .
the first time we met , you were chasing me .
the first time we spoke ,
you called me a sociopath .
well , that was at your trial ,
and i &apos;m not entirely sure i was wrong .
the first time we had dinner ,
you asked me what i wanted from you .
and the first time we kissed ,
i realized that i don &apos;t want anything ...
... except you .
and now i &apos;m asking if you &apos;ll go on one more adventure with me .
sara ellis ... will you marry me ?
yes , i will .
congratulations !
well done , well done .
nice going .
way to go , buddy .
oh , god . you bastard .
that was a little too real .
but it was damn good .
make it look good
that &apos;s my job .
mr. halden ?
congratulations to you and your lovely fiance , sara .
we &apos;re excited to have you celebrate
this special occasion with us .
as you requested ,
may i guide you to the 103rd floor ?
we &apos;re going higher ?
to the very top .
and the champagne ?
setting it up as we speak .
would you like to follow me ?
yeah .
i pulled caffrey &apos;s tracking .
he was on the observation deck .
now he &apos;s on the move . let &apos;s go get him .
diana , give me 60 seconds , then go .
you got it , boss .
i &apos;m here to see the senator .
agent burke .
how can i be of help to the fbi ?
oh , i &apos;m just checking in on you , senator .
i heard you had an altercation earlier today .
i &apos;m gonna be feeling much safer soon .
i &apos;m not so sure that &apos;s the case .
why would you say that ?
because any second now ,
my people are gonna find the evidence box
that you &apos;re so eagerly searching for on the 50th floor ,
right below us .
and then i can arrest you -- personally .
does agent callaway know about this ?
nobody move .
callaway , what are you doing ?
where &apos;s caffrey ?
caffrey ? do you see him here ?
his anklet says he &apos;s here .
neal &apos;s been known to slip his anklet .
check burke &apos;s leg .
what ?
agent burke , lift your pant leg .
you don &apos;t take orders from him .
no , you take orders from me . lift your pant leg .
bingo .
gun and badge now .
you have no idea how much trouble you &apos;re in .
peter , we &apos;ve got something .
hurry down to floor 50 .
remove his anklet . escort him out of the building .
everyone , let &apos;s move .
see ? i feel so much safer already .
i &apos;ve told you , here &apos;s better .
yeah , and a lot scarier .
could we join the mile @-@ high club ?
third of a mile , maybe .
why do sane people come up here ?
because it &apos;s forbidden .
oh . perfect .
what do we do now ?
now we relax and have a drink .
won &apos;t that mess up your plan ?
oh , neal , i &apos;m gonna miss this .
i did like your speech .
i had something else prepared , but ...
i meant that one .
another time , another place , right ?
what would that have looked like ?
well , you would have served out the rest of your sentence .
we would settle down in westchester ,
raise a couple of baton @-@ wielding con children .
boys or girls ?
one of each .
conrad , connie .
connie and conrad .
i like it .
to another time , another place .
to another us .
come here .
okay , we &apos;re clear .
guess it worked .
jones , berrigan , have you found the evidence ?
possibly .
everything okay ? where &apos;s peter ?
the two of you are no longer reporting to agent burke .
from now on , you &apos;re going to be reporting directly to me .
is it here ?
senator pratt , with all due respect ,
you can &apos;t be here . this is an active investigation .
this is a witch hunt .
i &apos;m here to make sure no one tampers with the box .
you can hold all the witnesses you want in this room ,
but i &apos;m not leaving .
i will report you to d.c.
you can report me to whoever you want .
i &apos;m staying .
please continue .
we got this image a few minutes ago .
it &apos;s in this ceiling section right up here .
great .
grab a saw , and let &apos;s pull it out immediately .
easy . you &apos;re pouring acid , not gin .
well , perhaps you &apos;d rather punch the tile into submission .
we need to find peter .
we need to follow through here first .
i hope james and the little guy made it in .
yeah , we &apos;ll know soon enough .
and pull !
that &apos;s it .
after all these years .
well , it &apos;s no 18th @-@ century music box , but , really , what is ?
uh @-@ oh , that &apos;s not good .
what &apos;s going on up there ?
clever , jimmy .
go time .
it &apos;s a setup to get me out of my office .
senator , i &apos;m gonna have to ask you to stay here
for your own safety . agents , come with me .
find &apos; em .
you know this isn &apos;t right .
agent callaway is making a big mistake ,
and you have the opportunity to turn this around .
let &apos;s go , agent burke .
i need to go back up there and reason with her .
i have my orders . now move .
attention . agent burke has eluded custody .
he &apos;s on elevator b @-@ 7 riding up .
copy that .
mozzie , come on .
what are you doing back there ?
i have a lot of stuff .
here &apos;s the box .
take the northwest stairs up to 103,
assuming it &apos;s clear .
it is if i go now .
okay , godspeed .

in a court of law .
you have the right to an attorney .
don &apos;t bother .
neal . thank god you &apos;re okay .
stop .
i already saw it .
i &apos;m not sure what you mean .
ellen made a copy of the report from the day she arrested you
for murdering your supervising officer .
forensics matched the bullet to your service revolver .
you told me they stole your spare firearm .
i might have mixed up the details .
you &apos;re smarter than that .
you choose your words carefully , like me .
who put this in your head ?
you did .
that day cost you 30 years of your life .
you don &apos;t forget that .
those are details you would never mix up .
what do you want to talk about ?
you shot him because you got in deep with the wrong people ,
and you crossed a line you couldn &apos;t come back from .
drop the gun .
hands on the car .
i &apos;m sorry , james .
if i keep looking through that , what else am i gonna find ?
you &apos;ll find that pratt was bad .
what about you ?
why did you come back here ?
i came back here to say goodbye to you .
what is it , diana ?
pratt &apos;s dead .
what ?
callaway arrested peter for his murder .
no -- - listen to me .
peter said james shot pratt in self @-@ defense .
james has to come in and tell them .
okay .
neal , peter &apos;s gun killed pratt .
there &apos;s gunshot residue on peter &apos;s hands .
it doesn &apos;t look good . find james .
what did you do , dad ?
they arrested peter for pratt &apos;s murder .
what did you do ?
it was self @-@ defense .
all you have to do is tell the truth ,
and peter goes free .
i can &apos;t do it .
i can &apos;t let the bureau put a murder weapon back in my hand .
the bureau doesn &apos;t believe him .
he was investigating pratt off @-@ book .
you &apos;re the only other person who knows what happened .
they &apos;ll cuff me , neal .
once they get me , i &apos;ll never get away .
you &apos;re gonna testify , and you &apos;re gonna clear peter &apos;s name .
you show me you &apos;re better than this .
you show me you &apos;re a decent man !
the things i &apos;ve done ...
are in the past .
i &apos;m sorry , son .
dad , please . do this for me .
don &apos;t !
don &apos;t make me do something i &apos;ll regret .
i &apos;m gonna give you some advice .
in this life , somebody always takes a fall .
