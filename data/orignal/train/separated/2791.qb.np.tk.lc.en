hey , eddie .
what are you doing here ?
watching you sleep .
why ?
it makes me feel peaceful .
please .
i can &apos;t sleep now !
you want me to sing ?
that &apos;s it . i want you out of the apartment now !
what are you talking about ?
hannibal lecter ?
better roommate than you .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re being fair ! one night you see me and you get scared .
what about the other nights when you don &apos;t see me ?
last night you went and got some water ...
... and i was nice enough to hide behind the door .
i didn &apos;t realize that .
get out now !
you really want me out ?
yes , please .
then i want to hear you say you want me out .
i want you out .
i want to hear it from your lips .
where &apos;d you hear it before ?
all right . you know what ? consider me gone .
i &apos;ll move into my brother &apos;s basement .
when he finds out , i &apos;ll go find someplace else .
i &apos;ll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow .
thank you .
i heard that .
the one where eddie won &apos;t go
well , look at you !
finally got that time machine working , huh ?
you like it ?
this guy was selling them on 8th avenue and i thought ...
... &quot; you know what i don &apos;t have ? &quot;
a mirror ?
fine , make fun . i think it &apos;s jaunty .
for a guy who &apos;s recently lost his job , you &apos;re in a good mood .
i &apos;ll be all right . i &apos;m not starting from square one .
i was dr. drake ramoray on days of our lives .
that &apos;s got to have some kind of cachet .
cachet ? jaunty ?
chandler gave me word @-@ of @-@ the @-@ day toilet paper .
i &apos;m gonna get some coffee .
go on . you know you want to .
no .
no ?
so ? did you read the book ?
oh , my god . it was incredible !
didn &apos;t it , like , totally speak to you ?
what book is this ?
you have to read this book . it &apos;s called be your own wind keeper .
it &apos;s about how women need to become more empowered .
but there &apos;s wind .
and the wind can make us goddesses .
do you know who takes our wind ? men . they just take it .
men just take our wind ?
all the time . because they are the lightning @-@ bearers .
that sounds kind of cool . it &apos;s like the hobbit .
it is nothing like the hobbit .
it &apos;s like reading about every relationship i &apos;ve ever had .
except for richard .
richard would never steal your wind .
because he &apos;s yummy .
but all the others .
and the part about how they &apos;re always drinking ...
... from our pool of inner power .
but god forbid we should take a sip .
anybody want a cruller ?
this is a typical lightning @-@ bearer thing .
it &apos;s like ...
... &quot; hello . who wants one of my phallic @-@ shaped man @-@ cakes ? &quot;
who have you been dating ?
don &apos;t worry about it , already ! things happen .
you &apos;re not mad at me for getting fired and everything ?
look at me .
look at me !
do i have lipstick on my teeth ?
can we get back to me ?
look , honey . people get fired left and right in this business .
i already got you an audition for another world .
all right !
&quot; cab driver number 2 &quot; ?
you &apos;re welcome .
but i was dr. drake ramoray !
how can i go from being a neurosurgeon to driving a cab ?
hey . there was a time when i played tickle @-@ pickle with rex harrison .
things change . roll with them .
but this is a two @-@ line part !
it &apos;s like taking a step backwards .
i &apos;m not gonna do this .
i &apos;m gonna tell you the same thing i told al minza ...
... and his pyramid of dogs .
take any job you can get , and don &apos;t make on the floor .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ll see you .
god !
oh , god ! i mean , it &apos;s just so ....
isn &apos;t it ?
this is like reading about my own life !
this book could have been called be your own wind keeper , rachel !
it wouldn &apos;t have sold a million copies ...
... but it would &apos;ve made a nice gift for you .
sweetie , we &apos;ve got to go .
no ! why do we always have to do everything according to your timetable ?
actually , it &apos;s the movie theater that has the timetable .
it &apos;s so you don &apos;t miss the beginning .
this isn &apos;t about the movie theater . this is about you stealing my wind .
you go , girl !
i can &apos;t pull that off , can l ?
excuse me , your wind ?
yes , my wind .
how do you expect me to grow if you won &apos;t let me blow ?
you know i don &apos;t ...
... have a problem with that .
i just really need to be with myself right now .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t have to apologize .
sorry . damn it !
what is it ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s got all this stuff about wind and trees ...
... and some sacred pool .
i don &apos;t really get it . but she &apos;s pretty upset about it .
this is why i don &apos;t date women who read .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s my vlsa bill .
envelope one of two .
that can &apos;t be good .
open it , open it .
oh , my god !
look at this ! how did i spend so much money ?
that &apos;s just the minimum amount . that &apos;s your total .
thirty @-@ five hundred dollars at &quot; porcelain safari &quot; ?
my animals .
the guy said they suited me . he spoke with an accent . i was confused .
i don &apos;t know what to do !
you can start by driving a cab on another world .
what ?
that audition ?
that &apos;s a two @-@ line part !
joey , you owe $ 1100 at &quot; i love lucite . &quot;
so what ?
so suck it up , man .
it &apos;s a job . it &apos;s money .
i don &apos;t need you getting judgmental and condescending and pedantic .
toilet paper ?
i &apos;m not being any of those things . i &apos;m being realistic .
you &apos;re supposed to be my friend !
i am your friend .
then tell me things like , &quot; you &apos;ll be fine . &quot;
and &quot; something big &apos;s gonna come along . i know it ! &quot;
but i don &apos;t know it .
what i do know is you owe $ 2300 at &quot; lsn &apos;t it chromantic ? &quot;
i &apos;m aware of what i owe .
then get some sense . it took you 10 years to get that job .
how long till you get another ?
i don &apos;t want to hear this !
i &apos;m just saying ....
well , don &apos;t &quot; just say &quot; !
maybe i should just go .
i &apos;ll see you later .
just think about it .
i don &apos;t need to think about it !
i was dr. drake ramoray !
that was huge !
big things are gonna happen ! you &apos;ll see !
ross !
you still there ?
what are you still doing here ?
just some basic dehydrating of fruits and vegetables .
man alive , this thing &apos;s fantastic !
aren &apos;t you forgetting anything ?
oh , yeah . i got us a new goldfish .
he &apos;s feistier than the last one .
maybe because the last one was made by pepperidge farm .
eddie , isn &apos;t there something you &apos;re supposed to be doing now ?
not unless it &apos;s got something to do with dehydrating .
because right now , i &apos;m a dehydrating maniac !
i thought we had a deal . i thought by the time i got
you know what that is ?
your last roommate &apos;s kidney ?
that &apos;s a tomato .
this one definitely goes in the display .
hey , gunther . let me get a lemonade to go .
lemonade ?
you okay , man ?
it &apos;s career stuff .
they killed off my character on the show .
that &apos;s too bad . how &apos;d they do it ?
i fell down an elevator shaft .
that sucks .
i was buried in an avalanche .
what ?
i used to be brice on all my children .
why must everybody watch me sleep ?
there &apos;ll be no more watching me sleep ! no more ...
... watching !
i got some great stuff to dehydrate . grapes , apricots .
i thought it &apos;d be cool to see what happens with these water balloons .
get out . get out , get out , get out !
what ?
you ! move out !
take your fruit ! your stupid small fruit and get out !
you want me to move out ?
i gotta tell you , that &apos;s kind of out of the blue , don &apos;t you think ?
this is not out of the blue !
this is smack @-@ dab in the middle of the blue !
relax ! take it easy , buddy !
you don &apos;t have to tell me twice .
someone will be by for my stuff .
if you think i &apos;m leaving you alone with my fish , you &apos;re insane !
you want some help ?
no help required , chico !
you don &apos;t see that every day .
all the way to the airport , huh ? you know , that &apos;s over 30 miles .
that &apos;s gonna cost you about so bucks .
excuse me , that &apos;s fifty bucks .
five @-@ o dollars .
you know what it is ? it &apos;s smudgy because they &apos;re fax pages .
when i was on days of our lives as dr. drake ramoray ...
... they &apos;d send over the whole script on real paper .
that &apos;s great .
if you wanted to expand this scene , like have the cab crash ...
... i could attend to the victims ...
... because i have a background in medical acting .
okay , listen , thanks for coming in .
don &apos;t thank me for coming in . at least let me finish .
we could take the expressway ...
... but this time of day you &apos;re better off taking the budge .
you were going for bridge there , weren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;ll have a good day .
honey , i know you didn &apos;t mean to.i know , me too .
hang up . you &apos;re supposed to be taking a goddess quiz .
you should lose 1.00 points for calling your boyfriend in the middle of it .
question number 28 .
&quot; have you ever allowed a lightning @-@ bearer to take your wind ? &quot;
i would have to say no .
and i would have to say ....
what ?
do you not remember the puppet guy ?
you totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power .
and his puppet too !
well , at least i didn &apos;t let some guy ...
... into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date !
who ?
paul !
moving on , moving on . next question .
okay , number 29 .
