we have some serious problems
that are gonna require serious work .
lynette and tom struggled with their separation .
mike heard a confession ...
i killed gaby &apos;s stepfather .
and me and the girls helped cover it up .
that could change his life with susan forever .
bree showed gaby the note ...
let &apos;s say someone knows .
i say until they tell us what they want ,
we just act like everything &apos;s normal .
and decided she needed to end her relationship
with detective vance .
you know , bree ,
i would have done anything for you .
you have made a very big mistake .
it &apos;s often said that children learn
their most important lessons outside the classroom .
they learn to find peaceful ways to resolve conflict ...
to make smart choices about nutrition ...
to master the art of conversation .
but for gabrielle solis ,
the art of morning drop @-@ off ...
what &apos;s soaking long ? come on ! let &apos;s go !
was something she &apos;d never learned .
you slow down , push the kid out , and drive off !
why is it so hard ? !
you realize i have to go to this school , right ?
oh , come on . i &apos;m behind the wheelchair kid ?
that &apos;s it , juanita . get out .
i &apos;m not allowed till we get to the green zone
and a volunteer opens the door .
remember what happened last week ?
yeah , last week i made it to my hot stone massage .
just keep your head down ,
pretend like you don &apos;t speak english , and run .
hold it !
hi , dana . i didn &apos;t see you there .
looks like someone didn &apos;t learn her lesson
the last two times she broke the drop @-@ off rules .
three strikes , solis .
you &apos;re out .
wh--hey !
i need that !
your drop @-@ off privileges have been revoked .
from now on , you &apos;ll be parking in the &quot; b &quot; lot
and walking juanita to class .
the &quot; b &quot; lot ?
that &apos;s , like , a mile away . these don &apos;t walk .
they do now .
oh , yeah ? well , who died and made you boss ?
margaret frye . cancer .
oh . right . i still owe for those flowers .
oh , relax , pam ! you &apos;ll still make it to weight watchers !
problem here , dana ?
oh , great . now the pips are here .
it &apos;s solis again . she &apos;s holding up traffic .
yeah , and i &apos;m not moving until you give me back the placard .
oh , pam , eat a carrot !
tell you what . if you can take the placard from me ,
you can keep it .
you know what ? i &apos;m not a child .
i &apos;m not gonna give you the satisfaction--
you know what , dana ? just because you &apos;re head of p.t.a.
doesn &apos;t mean you get to make the laws !
oh , i have news for you . here at oakridge , i am the law .
yes , some of our most important lessons
are learned outside the classroom .
and when it came to school politics ,
gabrielle &apos;s education was just beginning .
when it came to her separation ,
lynette scavo was determined to do everything by the book .
she made sure her visitation days
were evenly divided .
she kept perfect records of her household expenses .
she found healthy ways to relieve her stress .
yes , lynette was confident
her by @-@ the @-@ book approach was the right one ,
sadly , not everyone was on the same page .
well , look who cleaned out the sad @-@ sack aisle
at the bookstore .
at least your divorce is good for the publishing industry .
we &apos;re not using the &quot; d &quot; word .
it &apos;s a separation .
tom and i are going to &quot; heal through counseling &quot;
so we can find &quot; a road to reconnection &quot;
and if not ,
&quot; murder on the orient express . &quot;
penny , your dad &apos;s here !
explain something to me .
if you &apos;re trying to win back your husband ,
why do you dress like you sell oranges by the freeway ?
hey . sorry i &apos;m late .
i had to stop at the store ,
and it took longer than i expected .
because you tawt you taw a puddy tat ?
it &apos;s just a teeth whitener .
teeth whitening , huh ?
and unless sweat suits are the new business casual ,
it looks like you &apos;re working out , too .
i &apos;m trying .
it helps cheer me up when the kids aren &apos;t around .
daddy !
oh ! remember to get parker at practice .
i love you . have fun at your dad &apos;s . i love you .
bye .
drive safe .
i &apos;ve got a new book title for you--
&quot; your husband &apos;s banging somebody . &quot;
what ?
chapter one--white teeth .
chapter two--working out .
chapter three--the nasty .
he &apos;s just trying to take better care of himself .
oh , lynette .
i expect you to be naive about hair ,
makeup , and fashion ,
but about this ?
trust me . tom has hooked up .
he &apos;s not . he &apos;s not . if he was ...
dating someone ,
he would tell me .
he would .
right ?
that doesn &apos;t look too suspicious .
i &apos;m sorry . just-- every time i check the mail ,
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s gonna be another one of those letters .
it &apos;s been three weeks .
maybe we &apos;re out of the woods .
please don &apos;t say &quot; woods . &quot;
i &apos;m just saying , if someone was trying to blackmail us ,
they &apos;re not very good at it ,
since they haven &apos;t asked for money or anything .
well , what happened to them ? did they just disappear ?
if we &apos;re lucky .
now that chuck the cop is out of your life ,
susan &apos;s acting normal ,
i think we &apos;re in the clear .
oh , good . here they are . hmm .
oh , danielle and benjamin .
fun . what &apos;s the occasion ?
her husband left her .
ugh . okay . well , i &apos;d stay and say hi ,
but that would involve a lot of listening and sad nodding .
oh , honey , i am so sorry
about you and leo .
thanks , mom .
not that i didn &apos;t see it coming .
that didn &apos;t take long .
neither did the marriage .
so how are you holding up ?
my husband left me . it sucks .
but you know how that feels .
you just got dumped by that cop , right ?
actually , i am the one who ended it with chuck .
he wanted to marry me , bought me a ring ,
but that &apos;s not important .
this week ...
or weeks is about you .
we are gonna make a plan to put your life back together .
a plan ? mom , this all just happened .
give me a few days to eat ice cream and veg out .
of course , honey .
i promised you on your wedding day
that i would be here when he left you .
you know what ?
maybe we &apos;ll just crash on andrew &apos;s floor .
what ? that &apos;s so uncomfortable .
not as bad as staying here and getting picked apart by you .
i promise i won &apos;t criticize you .
besides , if you sleep on andrew &apos;s floor ,
you &apos;ll need a tetanus shot .
what ? i said i wouldn &apos;t criticize you .
i didn &apos;t say anything about your brother .
okay , i know that last night
i said you could take all the time you need
to work through what carlos and i told you ,
but ...
while you &apos;re taking all the time you need ,
you think you could maybe ...
tell me that you still love me ?
i mean ...
if you still love me ?
there is nothing you could do
that would make me stop loving you .
mike , it was so hard to keep this from you ,
like , the hardest thing i &apos;ve ever done .
well , at least i understand why you &apos;ve been so distant .
and to be honest ,
i &apos;m kind of relieved you weren &apos;t having an affair .
well , now that you know ,
i just want everything to go back to normal .
okay , but i hope you realize
it might not be that easy .
take it from a guy who &apos;s done things like this .
they don &apos;t just disappear .
yeah , i know that .
but i think if i focus on other stuff
and move on with my life ,
it &apos;ll be okay .
great .
and first step ?
i &apos;m taking a painting class at the college .
it &apos;s being taught by andre zeller .
okay , that means nothing to you .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m taking a football class from peyton manning .
whoa .
it &apos;s just what i need .
i think it &apos;ll be a great way
to take my mind off everything that &apos;s happened .
so i &apos;m gonna get my portfolio together .
mr. zeller has to approve all his students .
not that i &apos;m worried .
oh , and , mike ,
from now on , i swear ,
no more secrets between us .
is that my school ?
the tiny , little building way down there ?
it would &apos;ve been faster if we just walked from home .
first time in the &quot; b &quot; lot , huh ?
welcome .
what are you in for ?
practically nothing .
i let my kid get out of the car by herself .
ooh . dana take your placard ?
yeah , but i &apos;ll get it back in a day or two .
are you kidding ?
she &apos;ll have you in here for the rest of the year .
what ? she can &apos;t do that .
oh , you wanna bet ?
i took a cell phone call in the green zone .
that was two months ago .
my kid had peanut butter crackers in his lunchbox .
i &apos;m looking at four to six .
this is crazy .
no , this is dana .
dana &quot; the pain @-@ a . &quot; pfft !
dana &quot; you better not complain @-@ a . &quot;
dana &quot; power &apos;s driving me insane @-@ a . &quot;
oh , my god . is this what the &quot; b &quot; lot does to you ?
that , four kids , and the flask in her purse .
well , if everyone thinks she &apos;s such a pain @-@ a ,
how &apos;d she get the job ?
it &apos;s an elected position . we voted for her .
well , not me . i don &apos;t vote .
all right , when &apos;s the next p.t.a. meeting ?
there &apos;s one thursday .
okay . i say we band together ,
storm that meeting ,
and go all &quot; braveheart &quot; on dana &apos;s ass .
who &apos;s with me ?
you guys not seen &quot; braveheart &quot; ?
i know it &apos;s an old reference ,
but this is when you go , &quot; yeah ! &quot;
yeah .
oh , god . come on .
if every fed @-@ up mom in this &quot; b &quot; lot shows up ,
we can break our shackles , get our placards back .
we can--oh ! the movie &quot; 300 . &quot;
this is sparta !
you &apos;ve seen that , right ?
yeah !
okay . i &apos;ll see you ladies thursday .
this is excellent work .
thank you , mr. zeller .
now i know what you &apos;re thinking--
why does a professional artist who can do this
want to take a painting class ?
that is what i &apos;m thinking .
well , mainly because i &apos;m a huge fan of your work .
that series you did based on dante &apos;s &quot; inferno , &quot;
the one with the guy chewing the other guy &apos;s head off--
i wish i could paint like that .
you &apos;re very kind ,
but then again , look what you &apos;ve done with these bunnies .
um , do you start with watercolor
and then outline with rapidograph ...
actually , it &apos;s the other way around .
i have a very steady hand .
well , clearly .
my compliments , ms. delfino .
technically , this is very impressive .
oh , thank you .
so ...
obviously , i &apos;m in .
no . obviously , you &apos;re out .
what ?
don &apos;t get me wrong . you &apos;re a fine illustrator ,
but this isn &apos;t what i call art .
excuse me , but my paintings have been in dozens of books ,
some of them bestsellers .
perhaps you &apos;ve heard of &quot; doctor porcupine &quot; ?
he has a very prickly bedside manner .
right . but see , when you say &quot; art , &quot;
you mean a hedgehog with a stethoscope ,
and to me , art means reaching down your throat ,
tearing your guts out , and smearing it all over canvas .
anger , passion-- that &apos;s what interests me .
well , uh ,
&quot; doctor porcupine loses a patient and kills a hooker &quot;
doesn &apos;t have the same ring to it .
i &apos;m looking for serious students of the medium .
you &apos;re a bored housewife trying to kill time
between spin class and driving your kid to soccer practice .
hey , that &apos;s not fair .
um , just because i &apos;ve done children &apos;s books
doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t do anything else .
really ? do you have any work
that reflects what i &apos;ve been talking about ?
of course i do .
i &apos;ll bring it in tomorrow .
i would bring it in now , but i have to pick up my son ...
from prison .
in 1985 , musician bob geldof
organized a benefit concert to fight famine in ...
there you are .
though i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m surprised .
it &apos;s where you &apos;ve been the last three days .
guatemala . it &apos;s guatemala !
ethiopia .
loser .
ethiopia is correct ! congratulations .
well , given that you won &apos;t be
making your fortune off game shows ,
perhaps it &apos;s time we had that talk about your future .
mom , i &apos;m still healing .
my marriage fell apart .
you , of all people , should know how that feels .
yes , and i sat in that same chair &quot; healing &quot;
and eventually turned into a raging alcoholic .
oh , man .
wine sounds really good right now .
we should get a bottle .
what , you can &apos;t even have a sip ?
no ! now you need to think about
putting your life back together , getting a job .
you have a son to consider .
oh , jeez .
i found you !
now go hide , and we &apos;ll play again !
one , two , three ...
okay , there is something i &apos;ve been thinking about doing .
oh . what job ?
retail ? waitressing ?
better . my own business .
i designed this exercise equipment ,
and i think i could sell it on the internet .
danielle , what do you know about starting a business ?
i already have the design , and i wrote up a business plan .
i think it could really work .
all i need is a little seed money . say $ 5,000 ?
$ 5,000 ?
well , i need the supplies ,
and i have to rent a place to work out of .
i will give you $ 500 , and you can use the test kitchen .
seriously ?
mom , thank you so much . this means a lot to me .
well , i am very proud of you . and you know what ?
you are setting a wonderful example for benjamin .
oh , crap .
ready or not , here i come !
sorry i &apos;m late .
i hope you don &apos;t mind if i have my lunch
while we go over our schedules .
that &apos;s lunch ?
protein shake .
just trying to stay , uh , lean and mean .
i did that once .
all i got was mean .
hey , i had to move my meeting to wednesday afternoon .
think you can pick up the kids ?
i &apos;ll cover penny &apos;s orthodontist on friday .
sure . and saturday , parker has that birthday .
since that &apos;s your day ,
you can have him longer on sunday , if you want .
great . yeah . okay .
that is everything on my end . you ?
um , i heard back from that couples counselor .
she can squeeze us in thursday at 6 : 00 .
i mean , if you still want to go to therapy .
absolutely .
i can make thursday work .
good . i &apos;ll book the appointment .
hello ?
y--hey , can i call you back ?
okay . o @-@ okay . hold--hold on a sec .
um , this is a work thing .
is there anything else you need from me ?
uh , no .
okay . okay .
i will ... see you thursday .
okay .
hey , sorry about that . i , uh , i was in ...
let me get this straight , jill .
for back to school night appetizers ,
you &apos;re suggesting pretzels ?
what are we , a public school ?
hey . sorry . hey .
did you guys know there was an a.a. meeting in the gym ?
i sat through five &quot; i left my kid in the car
while drinking &quot; stories
before i realized i was in the wrong place .
doughnut ?
gabrielle solis .
what brings you to your first ever p.t.a. meeting ?
same thing that brought our founding fathers to ...
wherever they went
when all that crap happened with england--freedom .
freedom ?
yeah , that &apos;s right .
freedom to oppose an unjust ruler
and her unjust placard @-@ stealing ways .
we are here to tell you your reign of terror is over .
right , girls ?
guys , come on !
melissa , have you forgotten about
the blood blister you got hiking from the &quot; b &quot; lot ?
and you ... other woman ,
you were 20 minutes late to your manicure .
show &apos; em your hands .
this can &apos;t go on .
she &apos;s right .
yeah . tell her , gaby .
according to your sacred rule book ,
which , by the way , is a snore fest ,
a group of five parents can seek a vote
of no confidence in a president .
so ... i guess we &apos;ll be taking that vote now .
melissa , rachel ...
you sure you want to do this ?
no . it &apos;s an obvious bribe .
well , it worked .
yeah .
what ?
guess we won &apos;t be having that vote after all .
so what ? what more can you do to me ?
i already park in the &quot; b &quot; lot .
nice , mom .
hello !
mom . i , uh , i asked you not to come in here .
i am not staying . i just thought
my little entrepreneurs could use some lemonade .
this is it , the big internet start @-@ up .
yes , and for your information ,
as soon as we put up the site , they started selling like crazy .
over 200 of &apos; em .
well , i stand corrected . good for you .
so how exactly does this exercise equipment work ?
uhuh , well , it kind of incorporates pilates
and stretching .
it &apos;s really more for serious athletes .
that might be another order . i should get that .
but could you take benjamin to go get some lunch ?
of course . benjy .
hello . x @-@ stasy sex swing .
we put the swing back in your sex life .
yes , it can support up to 300 pounds .
and we guarantee maximum pleasure
for you and your partner .
ready ?
is this for me ?
unless you know another penny scavo
with an incredibly generous mom .
look , it even has a camera .
cool !
but my birthday was last month .
i know , but this way , when you &apos;re at your dad &apos;s ,
we can video chat ,
like , when you need help with homework
or you &apos;ve been having trouble with math .
no , i haven &apos;t .
well , you might . so ... bring it .
okay ?
hey , sweetie . long time no see .
mom , you just dropped me off ..
really ? it feels like forever .
the gum you gave me in the car still has flavor .
well , i miss you .
actually , since you called ,
we &apos;re multiplying mixed fractions ,
and i &apos;m kind of--
i know what you mean . can you move your head ?
uh , sure .
so do i need a common denominator ?
honey , the sun &apos;s creating a glare .
would you mind turning your screen just a scooch ?
okay .
dad &apos;s new place looks nice .
yeah , it is .
hey ! you know what might be fun ?
why don &apos;t you give me a tour ?
just turn your tablet around and scan the room .
oh , big @-@ screen tv .
there &apos;s a 9.0 on the predictability scale .
empty pizza box , dirty plate ,
dirty glass .
it &apos;s nice he &apos;s kept the same decorating scheme .
my arms are getting tired .
little longer . think light thoughts .
stop . go back .
i want to see your dad &apos;s new lovely ... curtains .
they &apos;re nice .
but they seem a little young for him .
who is that ?
that &apos;s chloe .
she lives in the building . she &apos;s really nice .
apparently .
so ... is chloe around a lot ?
sometimes .
she teaches a booty burn ballet class ,
so she &apos;s mostly at the fitness center .
hey , mom . dad &apos;s got black toilets .
you wanna see them ?
no , thanks . i &apos;ve seen enough .
okay . so when i multiply these fractions--
okay , sweetie , i love you .
oh , that &apos;s different .
what does this mean to you ?
loneliness , isolation ,
not long ago , this tree was lush and green ,
but now it &apos;s , uh , lost its leaves ,
and winter &apos;s ahead .
and it &apos;s just doing what it can to survive .
so let me guess-- you &apos;re the tree .
oh , okay .
you &apos;re ... mocking me again .
well , good @-@ bye .
hold o o we &apos;re having an artistic dialogue here .
i bet your night went something like this--
you went home and asked yourself ,
&quot; how do i prove to andre zeller that i &apos;m deep ? &quot;
so you dug down through the cupcakes
and the throw pillows
and the once @-@ a @-@ week sex of your life to your very core ,
and you found this sad little tree .
&quot; and it &apos;s so profound
&quot; because the tree &apos;s lonely , just like i am
&quot; now that &apos; oprah &apos;s &apos; off the air . &quot;
how dare you .
you don &apos;t know anything about me .
what &apos;s to know ? you &apos;re shallow ,
and your work is shallow , and god bless ,
because if i had your life , i &apos;d be painting bunnies , too .
you want everything to be nice and pretty .
you &apos;re afraid of ugly .
you--you think i &apos;m afraid of ugly ?
you want ugly ?
there .
there &apos;s some ugly for you .
you want passion ?
well , here you go . there &apos;s passion .
passion all over the place .
you know , i am not some shallow soccer mom .
i have done things that you can &apos;t believe .
i have anger !
and i have pain !
i have secrets in me that i wish ...
i could get rid of , and i can &apos;t !
it &apos;s fine . you know , you--you &apos;ve made your mind up about me .
so screw your class , screw your medium .
screw you !
ah , there you are .
hey , do you have a recipe for ...
oh . congratulations .
for what ?
well , i didn &apos;t know you and chuck were back together .
we &apos;re not .
well , then why are you wearing a sex swing ?
a what ?
oh , no . this is , uh , danielle &apos;s new business .
she &apos;s making exercise equipment .
uh , yeah ,
for a very specific kind of exercise .
sex swing ?
i &apos;ve never even heard of such a thing .
now don &apos;t try this one if you get dizzy easily .
mom ?
exercise equipment ?
when i get out of this , you are in so much trouble !
i &apos;ll write you a check later .
a sex swing in my test kitchen ?
do you realize i used to make people wear hairnets in here ?
danielle , i am very disappointed in you .
gosh , where have i heard that before ?
oh , don &apos;t you try to turn this around on me !
for the first time in my life ,
i found something that i &apos;m good at
and that &apos;s successful ,
and that &apos;s still not good enough for you !
you just live to judge me .
danielle .
danielle , where are you going ? !
no , i &apos;m telling you . it was bad .
andre probably called the looney bin ,
and they &apos;re on their way here right now with a butterfly net .
it &apos;s okay , babe .
no , it &apos;s not . i just ran out of there .
i @-@ i @-@ i forgot my portfolio .
i don &apos;t know what the hell came over me .
susan ...
i know how badly you want
what happened in the woods to go away ,
but i have to tell you the truth .
it &apos;s not going to .
it &apos;s part of you .
no . n--mnh .
i @-@ i don &apos;t want it to be .
i don &apos;t want it to be either ,
just like i don &apos;t want my dark stuff to be part of me ,
but it is .
mike , please . please stop saying this .
i &apos;m trying to protect you .
if you can accept this as part of you ,
maybe you can figure out how to live with it .
but if you don &apos;t ,
that &apos;s when it jumps out without warning .
and trust me ,
that &apos;s a bad way to live .
so ...
things are never gonna be the way they were ?
things ...
are how they are .
you okay ?
mommy , will you check my math worksheet ?
it &apos;s really hard .
sure . sure , honey .
in case you &apos;re wondering how i got here ,
the u.p.s. man heard my cries and cut me down .
suffice it to say , we &apos;re fedex people now .
look , i know you think that i am judgmental .
think ?
&quot; danielle , you should &apos;ve gone to college . &quot;
&quot; danielle , you dress like a streetwalker . &quot;
&quot; danielle , i knew your marriage wouldn &apos;t last . &quot;
yeah , a little bit .
what i was going to say is you &apos;re right .
why are you admitting this ?
because i thought about what you said ,
and i realize i am far from perfect .
i have no right to be so critical .
okay , now you &apos;re freaking me out .
did something happen ?
just know that a certain recent ... event
made me aware that i am in no position to judge you
or anyone else .
what are you talking about ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
the point is ...
can you forgive me ?
that &apos;s , like , the first time you &apos;ve ever said that .
thank you . and ...
yes , i forgive you .
and to prove that i am sincere ,
i would like to invest in your business
and support you in making
those disgusting ... ly happy swings .
you mean like a silent partner ?
a silent , invisible ,
and completely untraceable partner
who supports you from far , far away .
i love you , sweetie .
i love you , too .
now ... go pack up your sex factory ,
and i will bake us some cookies .
you &apos;re about to paint a hundred bad paintings ,
so let &apos;s get those out of the way
so you can start painting the good ones .
what are you doing ?
uh , i forgot my portfolio .
sit down .
excuse me ?
sit down . you &apos;re late .
does that mean you &apos;re letting me join the class ?
for now .
but that woman who showed up yesterday--the crazy one--
she better be here every single day .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know if i like that woman .
she scares me .
good .
okay , i want you to start
by forgetting everything you heard about brush technique .
i &apos;ve seen your painting .
either you heard it wrong ,
or it was wrong .
hey . are you ready for our walk ?
actually , change of plans .
i thought we &apos;d go to that booty burn ballet class
at the fitness center .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing . can &apos;t a woman just wanna burn her booty ?
fine . i think you &apos;re right about tom seeing someone .
she &apos;s an aerobics teacher .
of course she is . cliche much ?
so i &apos;m thinking , i &apos;ll go to her class , and i &apos;ll--
actually , i @-@ i don &apos;t know what the hell i &apos;m thinking .
you &apos;re thinking you wanna spy on this woman
and see what she &apos;s like , then key her car on the way out .
it &apos;s perfectly natural .
so i &apos;m not crazy ? i shouldn &apos;t just be direct
and ask tom if he &apos;s seeing someone ?
why ? so he can lie to you
through his unnaturally white teeth ?
okay , then .
i guess we &apos;re going .
yeah . uh , booty burn ballet--
think we can do this ?
oh , please . how hard can it be ?
am i the only one about to pass out ?
no . i keep seeing my dead grandfather
at the end of the tunnel ,
saying &quot; come toward the light . &quot;
keep going , ladies . keep your eyes on the thighs !
did she just use a civil rights rallying cry
to get us to lose ass fat ?
first time , huh ?
oh , what gave me away ?
the fact that this was light blue when i came in ?
well , the good news is
if you have a heart attack , i &apos;m a doctor .
the bad news is if you have one , i &apos;m not .
okay , so if i die ,
please put me ass up in the coffin .
i &apos;d hate for all this work to go to waste .
on your feet , ladies .
okay , we &apos;ve checked out the competition .
can we go now ?
no .
i want to talk to her .
okay , everybody ,
time to work those quads .
i don &apos;t know who i hate more right now--you or her .
50 lunges !
jump towards your skinny , skinny future .
and we have a winner .
hi . it &apos;s mrs. solis .
can you tell sean i &apos;m running about 20 minutes late
for my brow @-@ waxing appointment ?
what ? you can &apos;t hold it for me ?
but i &apos;ve got caterpillars over my eyes .
fine . i &apos;ll be there in five minutes .
juanita , get back in the car .
we &apos;re going drop @-@ off .
gaby , what are you doin &apos; ?
you can &apos;t be in the carpool lane without a placard .
don &apos;t give a crap . it &apos;s time somebody taught dana a lesson .
we need to break the back of our oppressor .
mobilize the cones !
get out , sweetie . go . go . go , go , go !
i &apos;m never gonna get that eyebrow wax .
again , dana , i am so sorry .
on the upside , that cast is so slimming .
it &apos;s like a hard spanx .
gaby , there &apos;s a reason i asked to see you .
you wanted to give me my placard back .
no . could you hand me those painkillers ?
i just wanted to bring you up to date
on some school @-@ related news .
given my condition ,
they &apos;ve informed me that i &apos;m no longer able
to carry out my duties as p.t.a. president .
that &apos;s a bummer .
yes , it is .
the bylaws state i &apos;m to appoint an acting president ,
and i &apos;ve made my decision .
me ?
wait . you hate me .
very perceptive .
that &apos;ll serve you well as p.t.a. president .
w--okay , wait .
why are you doing this ?
let me tell you what i was like before i took this job .
i was fun .
i drank at school functions .
my boob fell out at the holiday party .
i still had a husband .
so what turned you into this ?
the job did . mm @-@ hmm .
and it &apos;s gonna do the same to you .
yeah , no time for manicures
&apos;cause you &apos;ll be planning the winter gala .
no more seeing your husband
because you &apos;ll be organizing the bake sale .
and no more friends ,
because you &apos;ll always be hitting them up for something .
well , as attractive as your little revenge fantasy sounds ,
i &apos;m gonna pass .
then i guess i &apos;m gonna have to go ahead and press charges .
what are you talking about ? it was an accident .
i have witnesses
who heard you say you were going to break my back .
and i do have a broken back .
so the winter gala ...
it &apos;s in the winter , right ?
that &apos;s interesting . interesting .
so really , you have three careers .
you &apos;re a aerobics instructor , aromatherapist ,
and a lingerie model .
well , lingerie modeling is more of a hobby than a career .
oh . but when god gives you these ...
right .
are you sure god gave you those ?
i &apos;m just kidding .
i &apos;m just kidding . it &apos;s nice talking to you , chloe .
ready to go ?
yes .
so ?
well , obviously , i &apos;m not thrilled . look at her .
but it could be worse .
how ?
she could look like that
and have a single thought in her head .
i mean , there &apos;s no way tom &apos;s ever gonna get serious
about a woman like that , right ?
yeah . she &apos;s just a fling . mm .
a palate cleanser .
the sorbet you eat between courses .
i &apos;m really sorry i said that .
i give the whole thing three weeks .
lynette ?
hey ! tom . what &apos;s--what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;ll meet you at the car .
okay .
wh @-@ what are you doing here ?
i know .
know what ?
wh--
okay .
we just had dinner a couple of times .
there &apos;s nothing going on .
whatever .
so this is how you &apos;re gonna be spending your free time now ,
spying on me ?
well , that &apos;s a brilliant strategy , tom .
act like i &apos;m the one in the wrong .
you &apos;re the one dating the underwear model .
what are you talking about ?
chloe ? i &apos;m not dating chloe .
jeez , lynette , give me a little credit .
then you have you been having dinner with ?
why are you here ?
i am picking up jane , chloe &apos;s mom .
like i said , it &apos;s just a couple of dinners and coffee .
oh , it &apos;s coffee now ?
god , tom , when were you gonna tell me this ?
thursday , in counseling .
you ready to go ?
yeah .
lynette , we &apos;ll talk about this thursday , right ?
what &apos;s the point ?
yes , we often learn our most important lessons
outside the classroom--
the painful truth about the state of a relationship ...
the ugly cost of challenging authority ...
the sad fact that life &apos;s colors aren &apos;t always rosy ...
then there are those
who refuse to accept these important lessons .
they simply wait for the chance
to teach a lesson of their own .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re still stewing about that redhead .
well , i &apos;m not a big fan of getting led on
and humiliated , so , yeah , i &apos;m not ...
don &apos;t think i &apos;m letting go of this one yet .
suit yourself .
i got some missing person reports here for you .
