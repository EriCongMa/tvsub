oh , my god .
what ?
hanna was arrested .
hanna &apos;s lawyer will do his best to get her out on bail .
but it might not be possible .
why ?
tanner found the clothes mona was wearing
the day she died , and hanna &apos;s blood was on them .
have you talked to toby since you got back ?
it &apos;s not really a good idea , under the circumstances .
what can i get for you ?
actually ,
i &apos;m looking for someone , hanna marin .
why are you looking for hanna marin ?
my name is lesli . i was a friend of mona &apos;s .
mrs. vanderwall said you were trying to find me .
not just you ; the others .
you girls were there for mona , i wasn &apos;t .
i want to thank you for that .
i &apos;m getting a little tired of memorializing mona .
are you saying that the world &apos;s better off without her ?
we &apos;re lucky she didn &apos;t get to college
and start thinking about running for president .
the d.a. is offering a plea bargain .
if you plead guilty ,
and you take responsibility for your actions--
i did not kill mona !
as the trial enters its second month ,
艾莉森 · 迪劳伦提斯
the state &apos;s case against alison dilaurentis
the infamous teen accused of murdering her classmate ,
has taken a new turn .
here to tell us more is our expert on the case ,
sara shepard .
萨拉 · 谢波德 新闻9频道分析员
sara , you have been with this one since the beginning .
tell me , is this kid going down , down , down ?
she might , bill .
the d.a. has painted alison as the ultimate mean girl ,
and it looks like one of her classmates
knew that her abduction was pulp fiction .
the defense claimed that alison is a scapegoat .
could she be innocent ?
we &apos;ll know more today .
the prosecution , in its rebuttal ,
has just announced a surprise witness .
surprise witness . that must &apos;ve rattled the defense team .
oh , it &apos;s rattled a lot of people .
counselor , will you call your next witness , please ?
the commonwealth calls lesli stone to take the stand .
i knew she was trouble .
where &apos;s she been all this time ?
probably took her a while to cross the river styx .
i do .
so you hadn &apos;t seen your friend since the school year began ,
but you were in constant communication .
mona and i talked on the phone a lot .
we grew very close last summer .
we texted all the time .
and on one occasion ,
mona actually sent you a card , correct ?
yes .
and in this card ,
mailed two weeks before thanksgiving ,
what did mona tell you ?
she was having a hard time ,
and she had been threatened by her .
and what was the nature of this threat ?
ally said if mona opened her trap
about the fake kidnapping that she &apos;d be eaten by worms .
objection . hearsay .
the witness is quoting the victim , your honor .
it &apos;s all in the card .
objection overruled .
and why have you decided to share this card with us now , lesli ?
i couldn &apos;t find it .
it came during midterms ,
and i stuck it in a textbook .
and honestly , i didn &apos;t take it seriously enough .
why ?
everyone has feuds in high school .
i didn &apos;t realize what mona was dealing with
until it was too late .
and then , when i came to see her mom , um ...
what happened then ?
i realized something weird was going on .
even though alison was already locked up ,
her friends were all on edge
about anyone asking any questions ,
or touching mona &apos;s things .
i was pratically attacked by mona &apos;s boyfriend
for borrowing a book from her room .
do you think that alison &apos;s friends
were hiding something to protect her ?
yes .
one of them , hanna marin ,
wouldn &apos;t even let me go into mona &apos;s bedroom .
she stalked me the entire time i was in rosewood .
what are you doing ?
calling caleb .
did you share your observations with mona &apos;s mother ?
if you &apos;re on your way there , tell hanna
that she just got tossed under another wheel of the bus .
you should probably call her mom , but , um ...
us first .
have they taken a recess ?
no .
no , i just ... i did .
it &apos;s getting worse .
i &apos;ve been following the trial--
i thought i would hear from you
the second that hanna was arrested .
your mom said you were in london .
i was , but i came back as soon as i could .
i couldn &apos;t reach out yet--
okay , because your boss is using us
to build a case against me . so you &apos;ve said .
i should probably get back .
wait .
how did the interview go ?
for oxford .
not well .
&quot; a &quot; kind of followed me to the uk .
packed some vials of blood in my bag without me knowing it ,
and my purse exploded and hemorrhaged
all over a 200 @-@ year @-@ old chair .
it was actually horrifying .
you should &apos;ve called me .
i was told not to , remember ?
it &apos;s fine .
i had a panic attack , i shredded my carry @-@ on .
i wanted to swing back to philadelphia , but , um ...
melissa &apos;s roommate helped me through it .
he was very sweet .
hey , toby .
we need to talk to hanna , soon .
why ? what else did lesli say ?
i can &apos;t . there are barracudas with duller teeth .
不得靠近
stalked her ? i did not stalk her .
you told me to keep an eye on her at all times .
i probably would &apos;ve let her go to the bathroom by herself .
who the hell is lesli stone ?
i mean , does she go to our school ,
because i &apos;ve never even heard her name before today .
she lives with mona &apos;s grandparents .
last summer , they became besties .
a bestie who couldn &apos;t be bothered to go to her funeral .
yeah , and somehow dug up a greeting card
that makes me look like squeaky fromme .
but , guys , what if lesli &apos;s here
on behalf of another friend ?
she &apos;s not &quot; a &apos;s &quot; pawn .
lesli really cared about mona .
that &apos;s why she wants to see ali fry .
ali , what does your lawyer say about this ?
guys , we have nothing .
what happened at the varjak trail ?
it led us back to mona &apos;s house ,
and this paper filled with weird phrases .
i need something .
i &apos;m about to get life in prison
because mona wanted to use her last laurel and hardy stamp .
alison , what else can we do ?
we questioned cyrus ,
we hunted down the pizza box number .
hanna even tried to tell tanner about &quot; a . &quot;
you don &apos;t have an alibi .
now you &apos;re sounding like my lawyer .
she thinks going after a possible witness
is a complete waste of time .
wait . what witness ?
someone might have seen me , on thanksgiving .
at the playground ?
you said that you didn &apos;t see anybody .
i didn &apos;t , but i might not have been there alone .
where the hell are you ?
i &apos;ve been here for an hour , and i &apos;m freezing .
why did you run ?
i thought it might &apos;ve been &quot; a , &quot; but now i &apos;m not so sure .
so you don &apos;t know if it was a man or a woman .
or a squirrel .
i saw the jacket , and ...
maybe someone was sleeping in there .
look , ali , maybe if we went back there--
what happened ?
her time &apos;s up .
mike !
yeah , i &apos;m coming .
where have you been ?
i had a make @-@ up test .
i came back to get my stuff for practice . what &apos;s going on ?
mona &apos;s pal lesli , she took the stand today
and she basically trashed you .
what ? i &apos;ve only met that girl once .
well , you &apos;re kind of hard to forget
when you try to pinch off someone &apos;s head .
what did she say ?
did you tell her that i was--
no , we can &apos;t talk to her .
aria , if someone &apos;s making me look like i hurt mona--
okay , just shut up and listen to me .
there &apos;s a very good chance
that you might get called in there to testify .
bring it on .
i &apos;m ready to talk .
no , no , no , you &apos;re not .
mike , you have to keep what you know to yourself .
i already made that mistake .
if i had gone to the cops
the night i saw the blood and told them what mona was planning ,
she might still be here .
but if you bring up what mona did ,
who she was helping ,
this could come back to bite you . it always does .
so , what , you &apos;re asking me to lie under oath ?
no . i &apos;m asking you to have three answers :
yes , no , and i don &apos;t remember .
you got it ?
did you bring the paper ?
the words from mona &apos;s mirror .
what &apos;s the hold @-@ up ?
they &apos;re just words , they don &apos;t make any sense .
they only come in two sizes , girls .
toby , i am so glad you are here .
would you mind doing a coffee run ?
i don &apos;t get it .
i have been through the academy
the same as every other officer in there ,
so why am i being asked to photocopy parking tickets
and fetch lattes
while everybody else is working on a case ?
am i being punished for something ?
punished for what ?
the night of the gallery break @-@ in .
why would you be punished ?
you made an arrest .
when i ask you to go for a coffee run ,
it &apos;s because many of the officers are on back @-@ to @-@ backs .
i just thought it would be nice to have fresh coffee .
mom put your dinner in the fridge .
what &apos;s that ?
it was on the porch .
looks like photo supplies .
why are you suddenly in charge of all this ?
you &apos;re not even on yearbook .
&apos;cause mom thinks that asking students
to wipe lipstick from their teeth
will distract me from the trial .
hand me your keys , would you ?
aria .
i can &apos;t keep this to myself .
i could help hanna and alison if i told the police .
the longer that i wait--
mike , stop . please .
what &apos;s that smell ?
chemicals ?
what the hell ?
is that a tongue ?
oh , my god .
put it down . mike , put it down .
who sent this to you ?
who do you think ?
now do you get it ? this gift was for you .
the next time , it &apos;s gonna be your tongue on the porch .
mike ?
is everything all right ?
yeah . everything &apos;s fine .
mike , go eat dinner and we &apos;ll talk later .
so when did this happen ?
last night .
it was left out on my front porch .
my mother could &apos;ve opened that box .
i wish she had .
aria , if you and your brother are being threatened ,
you need to take that little gift to the police .
hanna made that mistake , and now she &apos;s sitting behind bars .
look , ezra , i &apos;m here because you get it .
you know what we &apos;re up against .
so will you do it or not ?
aria , even if i can get him out of town ,
i can &apos;t stop him from showing up
to court if he &apos;s been subpoenaed .
i can &apos;t hide him .
i understand .
but it &apos;s a long drive up to your cabin ,
so you can at least explain to him
why it is not necessary to volunteer dangerous information .
what about your parents ? what do they say ?
they &apos;re worried about mike .
they &apos;re totally up for him getting out of town .
you know what . forget it .
i came here because i didn &apos;t know who else to go to .
don &apos;t read silence as a &quot; no . &quot;
i &apos;m just trying to wrap my head around this .
you and mike or you and me ?
i &apos;ll pick him up at 4 : 00 .
does alison know we are doing this ? did you talk to her ?
no , i didn &apos;t want to get her hopes up . or hanna &apos;s .
can i help you ?
um , yeah . maybe .
we were just looking for somebody .
playing hide @-@ and @-@ seek ?
yeah . sorta .
um , listen ,
this might sound a little bit crazy ,
but we &apos;re just looking to talk to anybody
who might spend a lot of time here .
that would be me .
yeah , my group comes up here a couple of times a month .
our church bought the lot .
have you ever seen anyone sleeping in here ?
or somebody who might spend a lot of time here
by themselves during the day ?
i &apos;ve never seen anyone else up here besides us .
but if you &apos;re trying to help the homeless ,
we &apos;re doing a really neat easter supper .
we could always use more volunteers .
thank you .
神圣三位一体青年团
you &apos;re actually only allowed 26 words ,
but if you need any editing suggestions ...
perfect . thanks .
molly borman &apos;s ready .
wow , you scared me .
you never called me back .
last night ?
yeah . i &apos;m sorry , there was ... family stuff .
what &apos;s going on ? this about mike ?
yeah , i asked ezra to get him out of town for a couple of days .
the trial is starting to mess with his head .
you asked ezra for help ? i thought you and he were--
no , we are .
but we &apos;re still friends ,
and he bonded with mike after mona &apos;s memorial .
i could bond with mike , too .
you don &apos;t need a teaching degree for that .
i know ,
but he &apos;s got a cabin up in the poconos ,
so my parents are comfortable with him taking mike up there .
i see . he &apos;s got mom and pop on his side , too .
andrew , it &apos;s not a competition .
i have a lot of history with ezra ,
so if he wants to be there for me ...
i &apos;ve offered the same .
somehow , you don &apos;t hear it when i say i &apos;m here 24 / 7 .
aria ?
i hear you , okay ? i do .
hi . can i see your form ?
thanks .
showing up now seems a little convenient , doesn &apos;t it ?
this chick gets a letter from a pal claiming a death threat ,
and she never mentions it to the cops for months .
can we not talk about that ?
she &apos;s making you and your friends
look like a coven of witches .
i know .
do you ?
because you need somebody to stand up in that courtroom
and tell the jury the truth ,
before that four @-@ eyed freak whips out some fake picture
of you stashing a weapon in mona &apos;s sock drawer .
do not put it past her .
look , i only get to see you for 30 minutes .
i don &apos;t want to spend 28 of them talking about this .
what about mike ?
i mean , he &apos;s still sitting on a hell of a story , hanna .
leave him out of it .
why ?
because he &apos;s a kid .
if he talks , that means two more years
of high school being tortured by &quot; a. &quot;
no , not if mike opens his mouth
and send the cops looking for the right person .
what am i supposed to do ?
how am i gonna help you , hanna ?
do you really want me to just show up here twice a week ,
and tell you what i thought was funny on south park ?
i can &apos;t even hold your frickin &apos; hand .
i love you , hanna ,
and i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m not gonna just walk away .
i &apos;m not gonna leave you .
that &apos;s just never gonna happen .
so mike needs to speak up .
he &apos;s just a kid .
what ?
oh , my god !
wait . let me ask the questions , okay ?
you can be aggressive sometimes .
i don &apos;t want to scare her .
i &apos;m emily . this is spencer .
we noticed that patch on your jacket .
we were wondering if you were part of the youth group .
why ?
did you ever spend time at river road playground ?
we &apos;re looking for someone who might &apos;ve been there on thanksgiving .
i wasn &apos;t .
okay , well , one of our friends was , and she heard ...
thought she might &apos;ve heard someone
who would &apos;ve seen her that night .
so i just wanna ask you if ...
you told her .
you promised you wouldn &apos;t , and you told your daughter .
how else would they know ?
have you heard from mike ?
he called when they were near stroudsburg ,
but his phone cut out .
yeah , well , the service is spotty up there ,
but they &apos;ve got a land line at the cabin .
good . what &apos;s all this ?
just trying to find a quote for my yearbook picture .
that shouldn &apos;t be too hard .
you &apos;ve had an eventful four years .
maybe something from hamlet .
yeah , or frankenstein .
aria , emily and spencer had no right
to corner that poor girl .
once again , mom , they did not corner her .
we are just trying to find someone
who can back up alison &apos;s story
and prove that she wasn &apos;t in rosewood that day .
you are not on her defense team .
why won &apos;t you tell me why that girl freaked out
and turned on you ?
kendra is a good kid who made a big mistake ,
and i promised to keep her secret . it &apos;s that simple .
what kind of big mistake ?
i &apos;ve got two friends that are sitting in jail right now ,
and this person might be able to help them .
kendra went to a party the night before thanksgiving .
she didn &apos;t know the other kids , and she got nervous .
she experimented with some drug that was cut with speed ,
and had a very bad reaction .
she was worried that her parents would figure out
she was high as a kite ,
and there &apos;d be hell to pay .
so she hid out at a playground
until she was sober enough to go home and pass the cranberries .
why would she tell you this ?
you &apos;d be surprised what
students confide to their favorite teachers .
or maybe you wouldn &apos;t .
did she see alison that day ?
&apos;cause if she was at the playground--
she didn &apos;t mention seeing anybody else .
and why are you so sure
that alison was where she said she was ?
you need to separate yourself from her .
and what about hanna ?
am i just supposed to abandon her , too ?
kendra &apos;s not the only good kid out there
who &apos;s made a big mistake , mom .
took a lot longer than i thought .
takes about two hours . your sister usually falls asleep .
how often does she come up ?
she ...
what the hell are you doing ?
i thought you might be freaked out if you saw a light on .
hey , mike .
hey , how &apos;s it going ?
can we skip the greetings , please ?
what are you doing here , caleb ?
i &apos;m here for a reality check .
look , your sister is very scared ,
and she gave you bad advice .
there are a lot of people relying on you .
you need to come back with me and tell the truth .
whoa . stop . we just got here .
the only thing we &apos;re doing is taking off our jackets ,
heating up a frozen pizza ,
and if you calm down , we might even offer you a slice .
you know , i &apos;m good . while it &apos;s defrosting ,
we &apos;re gonna be in scranton . let &apos;s go , mike .
you can &apos;t just throw him
in the back of your car like a pair of boots .
this is a big decision to make .
yeah , and i made it .
i wanna go back .
mike , stop . do not be reckless with this .
you have a target on your back ,
and i know you wanna do the right thing .
yeah , i do .
which is coming back and telling what he knows .
he &apos;s right .
i need to do this . this is not gonna go away .
okay , fine .
would you mind getting the bags
out of the back of the car ?
you are messing with his head .
good . he &apos;s not made of glass .
he &apos;s 16 .
you know what ? we all have crap that we need to face
that we don &apos;t feel ready for .
hanna is locked in a cage with people who could kill her
with a comb .
oh , that &apos;s not fair .
what is fair ?
when i was his age , i was sleeping on the street ,
and trying to stretch $ 11 to last me a week .
so , what , simply because your life was hard , his has to be , too ?
no , but life doesn &apos;t get easier by avoiding things .
i guess you didn &apos;t learn that up on the horsey estate .
you wanna drag the kid back ?
fine . then what ?
are you gonna be there for him in the fallout ?
or is it only hanna you care about ?
the kid is ready to put on his big @-@ boy pants ,
and offer up a little insight .
otherwise , i will .
mike !
will you drink tomato juice ?
whatever . i don &apos;t care .
actually , you might . this could be sauce .
that girl will never talk to us .
and if aria &apos;s mom won &apos;t help us ,
we have to ask toby .
he &apos;s a policeman , spencer .
and if kendra &apos;s such a good girl ,
she &apos;s not gonna lie to someone wearing that uniform .
just please forget about toby .
what happened between you two in that stairwell ?
nothing . we danced around the fact
that i basically dated two other guys .
whoa , back up .
what do you mean , dated ?
okay , stop looking at me like i &apos;m the town pump .
there were a few spontaneous kisses , that &apos;s all .
who kissed who ?
does it matter ? i wasn &apos;t unconscious , emily .
and honestly , it felt really good to be with somebody
who wanted to be with me .
something that toby hasn &apos;t
wanted since he put on that stupid uniform .
closed mouth or open ?
drink your sauce .
mrs. montgomery called me .
we need to talk .
let &apos;s get a dust pan , i bet you don &apos;t lick it up .
i &apos;ve been studying the paper--
two minutes , ladies .
forget the paper .
there was someone there in the playground that day .
they found her .
what &apos;s going on here ? everyone back to your stations .
my god , alison , what are you doing ?
we can talk in the infirmary .
slam your hand in there .
what ? !
just do it .
you &apos;re taking too long , ladies .
hurry .
i can &apos;t do it .
i can &apos;t do it .
hold still .
how did this happen ?
it was an accident .
it wasn &apos;t an accident last time , alison .
if someone here is still harassing you ...
this was an accident .
what happened to you ?
she slammed her hand .
in a dryer .
really ?
is this the first time you girls have done laundry ?
where are you two think you are ?
homeroom detention ?
this is a murder trial , ladies .
and trying to defend someone who thinks she can
manipulate the system is a challenge i never agreed to take on .
give me the note .
give it to me .
what is this ?
i have an urgent message on my phone from your buddies .
better not be another manipulation .
mike !
mike !
ezra .
how long were you out there ?
1 : 00 p.m. , 2 : 00 p.m. ?
something like that .
2 : 00 .
and you were in the pipe the whole time ?
did you ever see anyone walk by ?
no .
but she heard a voice . you heard a voice , right ?
emily ?
i got this .
did you hear a voice ?
yes .
a girl &apos;s voice .
sorry .
who was she talking to ?
sounded like she was on the phone .
and do you recall what she said ?
not really . my heart was pounding .
thank you for stepping forward , kendra .
if we need anything else , we &apos;ll call you .
wait , no , why is she leaving ?
because it &apos;s 9 : 15 on a school night ,
and i &apos;m betting that kendra has algebra homework . good night .
but that &apos;s not the end of her story .
she heard alison get in her car .
it &apos;s been a long day , ladies .
but if kendra doesn &apos;t know
what you &apos;ll be asking her on the stand ...
i &apos;m not putting kendra on the stand .
what ? !
why ?
no jury is going to be swayed by a witness
who earlier in the day saw eight fingers on one hand ,
and was picking up npr through her cavity fillings .
we are not that desperate .
yes , we are .
we don &apos;t have anybody else .
yes , we do .
i &apos;m putting alison on the stand .
mike .
mike !
mike !
what is this place ?
i think it &apos;s some sort of scout camp . pathfinders .
are there cabins ? maybe he &apos;s hiding .
what the hell ?
do you see anything ?
no .
holy crap !
what the hell is going on ?
all right , come on .
get down .
did you see anybody ?
to the left , i think .
wait , wait .
i can &apos;t see &apos; em .
let &apos;s go .
all right , come on , come on .
can i come in ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i have done a lot to get that .
i got my butt kicked in the academy for it .
i fought with my dad about it .
i even got a buzz cut .
i did it because i was tired of not being able
to protect the one person in this world
that matters most to me .
and i am not gonna choose , spencer .
i &apos;m not gonna choose between it and you .
i never asked you to .
i know .
but tanner has .
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m gonna tell her
if she &apos;s not okay with me being with you ,
and being a cop ,
then she &apos;s gonna have to kick me off the force .
ezra , where are you guys ?
why is nobody picking up the land line ?
call me when you get this , please .
oh , no .
hey , andrew , it &apos;s me .
i thought that you &apos;d be home .
listen , if you meant the whole 24 / 7 thing ,
i &apos;d , um , i &apos;d really like you to take a drive
up to the cabin where mike is staying .
i can &apos;t get a hold of him or ezra or anybody ,
and i just know something is wrong and i need your help .
thank you .
oh , my god .
mike .
no , wait , wait .
what are you doing ?
getting proof .
okay .
it &apos;s okay .
these stills were taken from the vicious attack on mona .
as the forensics expert testified ,
the assailant hurled the victim with considerable force ,
strength that came from the assailant &apos;s right arm .
alison , will you please toss that to me ?
i &apos;m gonna back up a little bit .
objection . where &apos;s counsel going with this ?
are we gonna watch the defendant skip rope , too ?
ms. marcus , i don &apos;t like edible objects
thrown in my courtroom .
please , your honor , i &apos;m building a foundation .
get on with it .
alison , toss that to me over here .
again , please .
again , please .
and one more time .
was that last pass painful
because of the recent burn to that arm ?
no , ma &apos;am .
my elbow , this part of my arm ,
i once broke it and it never completely healed .
how old were you when you broke it ?
around three maybe .
you were just over two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half .
and i have doctors &apos; reports that show
that the fracture never healed properly .
ladies and gentlemen , this victim was slammed against the wall .
hurled like a rag doll ,
something that alison isn &apos;t even capable of doing
with a one @-@ pound grapefruit .
so you can &apos;t give me an exact time this occurred ,
but you believe it happened between 10 : 00 and midnight .
how tall was this individual , approximately ?
i already told you .
mike &apos;s vision was impaired , and we couldn &apos;t see anybody .
it was dark .
so neither of you can tell me the sex , the height ,
or the hair color of this individual .
no .
in fact , you can &apos;t even be sure
whether it was more than one individual .
is this the same information
you gave the sheriff in allegheny county ?
um , no , because we came straight here ,
because we figured it was connected .
you have to file it in the county where the incident occurred .
un @-@ frickin &apos; -believable .
this town has it so ass @-@ backwards ,
i cannot ...
okay , don &apos;t you get it ?
there is somebody after us .
the same person who went after hanna marin and her friends did this .
so just to be clear ,
instead of helping untie your friend ,
you stopped to take a photo .
it &apos;s kind of an odd reaction ,
don &apos;t you think ?
alison , i &apos;m sorry .
frankly surprised to hear about your injury
at this late juncture .
did this prevent you from
participating in your school &apos;s pe program ?
no , sir .
have you had to steer away from certain sports ?
yes , i have .
what about summers at sleep @-@ away camp ?
did that weak arm keep you from taking electives like archery ?
shall i repeat the question ?
did you take archery ?
i don &apos;t remember .
well , let &apos;s refresh your memory .
you not only took it , you were darn good at it .

to answer the question ?
miss dilaurentis , please answer mr. sirk &apos;s question .
counselor , would you please repeat the question for the witness ?
lieutenant , i need to speak with you .
toby , you should not have come in here today .
it &apos;s about spencer hastings .
there is nothing you can do . it is too late .
too late for what ?
to help her or her friends .
they chose to help the wrong person .
please make sure the door is closed
and locked when i &apos;m gone .
the jury may be deliberating for some time .
there &apos;s a private room down the hall .
i &apos;m fine .

he and jason went to get food .
i &apos;m still too nervous to eat .
honestly , i &apos;m mystified .
they had one hour for lunch ,
and they managed to dig up
an award you won when you were 11 years old .
i didn &apos;t even win it .

i talked my bunkmate into sinking the arrows
before i even picked up the bow .
we rigged it .

what ?
i mean , i know you &apos;re a nice guy and all ,
but i didn &apos;t know you were an award @-@ winning pathfinder scout . geez .
