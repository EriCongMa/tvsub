good morning everybody .
hey .
hi jeff .
i brought bagels .
oh i &apos;d love a bagel .
be a perfect beginning for my first day of billiards class .
oh did you pick a special outfit
so you can look sexy shooting pool ?
shirley i have no idea what you are talkin &apos; about .
13 .
ah great so much for &quot; baggels . &quot;
so much for what ?
the baggels . you dropped them on the floor .
uh they &apos;re called bagels .
uh i lived in new york troy .
i know what a baggel is .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
what ?
you say bagel wrong .
i say it the same as you .
say it again .
baggel .
look can we just keep studying ?
we &apos;re on page 258 .
what &quot; padge &quot; was that ?
two &quot; five @-@ ty &quot; eight .
check this out .
oh it &apos;s a drawing of abed with ...
hearts all around it .
strictly speaking troy
the bible condemns this level of friendship .
i didn &apos;t draw that .
i bought that book used .
it must have been whoever had it last .
obviously it &apos;s a girl who has a crush on abed .
this is so romantic .
it &apos;s just like the &quot; notebook &quot; except
instead of alzheimer &apos;s abed has--
someone who likes him .
well whoever she is she &apos;s fat .
these thick pencil lines are drawn with a heavy hand .
we gotta find this person for abed .
unless it &apos;s a boy then we have to find him for jesus .
but either way this is going to be fun .
adios .
adios .
adios .
adios .
guys !
class is over .
i &apos;m trying to get you to leave .
oh .
oh ... cool .
pick that up .
senor chang ?
we &apos;re trying to figure out
whose spanish book this was before troy &apos;s .
jenny adams .
oh .
oh come on .
if all chinese were psychic you would have started
using birth control centuries ago .
her name &apos;s in the front of the book morons .
yay ! he &apos;s right .
them i understand but how did you not think of that ?
i may have been thrown off
by britta &apos;s pronunciation of the word &quot; bagel . &quot;
how do you pronounce bagel ?
i don &apos;t .
come on .
baggel .
ugh ! you &apos;re the worst .
so ...
we have a name .
jenny adams .
cool .
see ? it &apos;s a fat girl &apos;s name .
might as well be &quot; gravy jones . &quot;
pierce it doesn &apos;t matter what she looks like .
this will be great for abed .
it will ?
aren &apos;t you excited about talking to her ?
i wasn &apos;t planning on it .
what ?
guys come on . you heard abed .
he &apos;s not interested . drop it .
jeff you need to mind your own business .
and abed you need to get with this girl immediately
if not sooner .
yeah ?
abed for guys like you
this kind of opportunity only comes around
once in a li-- while .
it &apos;s important to date in college abed .
it &apos;s a time of freedom and exploration
a time when a simple pillow fight between two innocent girls
could turn into a steamy night of unbridled lust .
britta knows all about it .
okay cool .
so you guys are gonna &quot; can &apos;t buy me love &quot; me right ?
we &apos;re gonna what you ?
you &apos;re gonna &quot; can &apos;t buy me love &quot; me .
you know transform me from zero to hero geek to chic .
oh he wants us to &quot; love don &apos;t cost a thing &quot; him .
oh .
&quot; can &apos;t buy me love &quot; was the remake for white audiences .
that &apos;s so uncomfortable when they do that .
i can &apos;t believe it doesn &apos;t insult them .
all right nobody here
is &quot; can &apos;t buy me love &quot; -ing
or &quot; love don &apos;t cost a thing &quot; -ing anyone .
because we &apos;ve all seen enough &quot; afterschool specials ... &quot;
&quot; fat albert ... &quot;
to know that abed only needs to be himself .
sure glad there are no old people here .
this conversation would probably be total gibberish to them .
jeff &apos;s unprecedentedly right about this .
abed when we find this girl
you &apos;re gonna approach her just the way you are
because that &apos;s good enough .
yeah and then you can take her to a nice deli
and treat her to a baggel .
hey nice shooting . good clean strokes .
thanks .
form a line please !
my name is coach bogner .
welcome to the art of pool
which is a phys. ed. class .
which means ...
that you all have to wear the proper equipment at all times !
so suit up .
see you back on the felt in five .
you &apos;re gonna look like an ass in those .
shut up leonard .
i talked to your son on family day .
i know all about your gambling .
touche .
all right everybody just hang out and be casual .
my sources tell me that jenny adams
is the blonde who &apos;s reading right over there .
whoa ! that &apos;s her ?
she &apos;s pretty !
wh @-@ which is not a surprise at all abed .
okay abed we &apos;re gonna be here for moral support .
just go over there and do your thing .
okay .
remember be yourself .
got it .
great .
cool .
abed ...
yeah ?
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m being myself .
go be yourself by jenny .
but i wouldn &apos;t go over there .
how do you know that ?
a lifetime of observation mostly .
well do you think there &apos;s a version of yourself
that might go over there ?
absolutely .
could you be him ?
okay .
what the hell was that ?
a different version of me .
i think it was a vampire .
all right if this is gonna turn ugly
i can &apos;t be here-- i &apos;m a two @-@ striker .
no pierce please .
hang on .
abed will you excuse us please ?
yeah .
look i know that we &apos;re all good people
and good people believe that people should be themselves .
but if abed is himself he &apos;s gonna die alone .
and if we let him be someone else without our help--
be right back .
i &apos;m out of here .
you &apos;re not in uniform .
yeah about that .
we seriously have to wear shorts to play pool ?
if you play in this class it &apos;s regulation .
regulation pool or regulation you ?
do you have something against playing pool
with a full range of motion and optimal comfort ?
i &apos;m comfortable in my own clothes .
i bet you are .
i &apos;m sorry ?
i said i bet you &apos;re comfortable
dressed like a model instead of an athlete
sippin &apos; martinis and smokin &apos; instead of keeping your game on the table !
hey listen man .
you &apos;re implying i &apos;m some sort of pool poser
because i don &apos;t want to wear a bathing suit .
you &apos;re the weird one .
that &apos;s weird .
not me .
nobody plays pool like that .
yeah well what do you call this ?
i call that your personal business okay ?
and i call this class
the desecration of america &apos;s coolest sport .
yeah ah see ? right there . ah ! &quot; coolest sport &quot; !
okay i want everybody to know what &apos;s going on here .
this hipster is dropping this class .
because he cares more about what he looks like
than how he &apos;s playing .
oh please .
you &apos;re the one with the rules about clothes .
and by the way i could kick your ass all over that table .
oh is that a challenge ?
huh ? because if you play me in pool
you play me in shorts !
and if you can &apos;t do that
well my point &apos;s already made .
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t have anything to prove to you .
you &apos;re stupid .
this is stupid !
pool in shorts is stupid !
vanity thy name is ...
his name .
it &apos;s the first day . i didn &apos;t catch it .
okay abed .
we know that normally you wouldn &apos;t approach a girl .
but if you don &apos;t learn how you won &apos;t get jenny .
yeah and you got two days .
then i &apos;m going after her .
oh ! pierce .
what ? i &apos;m incentivizing him .
also if she &apos;s into abed let &apos;s face it
anybody could hit that .
i understand--i need to change who i am to someone more likable .
no no no no sweetie it &apos;s not about changing .
it &apos;s about learning .
learning to change ?
no no it &apos;s ...
good grief !
clear the chickens off the runway .
i &apos;ll be the bad guy .
yes abed you need to be someone else .
someone who eventually gets a girlfriend .
because i can &apos;t think of anything more frightening
than a half @-@ polish half @-@ arab virgin in his 30s .
one way or the other
that story ends with an explosion .
let &apos;s try a practice run .
all right annie you sit here okay ?
and be a girl .
abed you take a run at her .
let &apos;s see what you got .
okay .
what are you reading ?
&quot; pride and prejudice . &quot;
so you &apos;re familiar with two sins .
how about a third ?
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re allowed to smoke in here .
then you picked the wrong outfit .
didn &apos;t you ?
abed what are you doing ?
don draper from &quot; mad men . &quot; what &apos;d you think ?
weird .
awesome .
put your tongue in her ear .
i liked it .
don &apos;t be him .
he cheats on his wife .
be somebody nice like mike brady .
he always had that housekeeper throwing herself at him
and he never made a move on her .
don &apos;t be mike brady . mike brady &apos;s not sexy .
you should be like jo from &quot; facts of life . &quot;
but you know the dude version .
i knew it .
you should be like calvin .
his best friend was a tiger .
he always went on dope adventures .
if anything stood in his way he just peed on it .
calvin coolidge ?
no you guys don draper was clearly the sexiest .
what are you guys doing ?
they &apos;re teaching me how to be someone else .
oh for god &apos;s sake . what did i tell you guys ?
oh for god &apos;s sakes everybody do whatever you want !
leave each other alone !
whoa ! that &apos;s a good jeff . how &apos;d you do that ?
10 % dick van dyke 20 % sam malone
40 % zach braff from &quot; scrubs &quot;
and 30 % hilary swank in &quot; boys don &apos;t cry . &quot;
zach braff ?
sorry .
abed what if you just did jeff for jenny ?
uh and your point is ?
look i don &apos;t want any part of this .
and i can &apos;t believe that you &apos;re still doing it
after i already explained the obvious lessons
smacking you in the face .
hey why aren &apos;t you in billiards class ?
because i don &apos;t look cool in shorts !
whoa. okay .
&apos;cause i &apos;m not cool in shorts !
just like him .
that was really good .
i don &apos;t want to spoil the ending but uh ...
pride ends up with prejudice .
that &apos;s funny .
i know . stick with me and you &apos;ll get a laugh or two .
that &apos;s the abed guarantee .
i feel like i &apos;ve seen you before .
it &apos;s working .
i know .
i get that a lot from art students .
i &apos;m told i have a face made for sketching .
i &apos;d rather think it was made for kissing .
how &apos; bout for punching ?
what are you doing hitting on my girlfriend ugly ?
this is awkward .
oh my god .
it &apos;s a white abed .
i @-@ i @-@ i--it &apos;s like abed but employable .
let &apos;s do this huh boss ?
let &apos;s go slumdog .
and one last lost and found announcement
jeff winger i &apos;ve been informed by coach bogner
that you left your panties in his pool class .
so better pick those up .
when is he gonna stop doing that ?
do you know that he called me a hipster ?
hipster ! i mean do hipsters walk around
wearing $ 300 jeans from italy ?
can we please talk about abed ?
thanks to us his heart &apos;s been broken .
well i hate to say that i told you so .
so i &apos;ll shout it through cupped hands
i told you so !
we were only trying to help .
oh come on . who are we kidding ?
jeff &apos;s right-- abed was happy being abed
till we had to sully his mind with thoughts of love
and romance ... and vaginas .
those are the big three . that &apos;s what they call them .
poor abed he &apos;s probably too sad to get out of bed this morning .
hi .
abed .
about yesterday ...
oh yeah .
you guys must be pretty upset .
why would we be upset ?
well i know how important it was for you that i get a girlfriend .
so when jenny went off with white abed
it must have really hurt .
ah it did .
white abed ?
jenny &apos;s boyfriend is a white guy that &apos;s almost identical to abed .
name is joey and that &apos;s why the sketch was in troy &apos;s book .
so does that make abed &quot; brown joey &quot; ?
if you want to get racist about it .
abed you know we just want you to be happy right ?
yeah i know . everybody wants me to be happy .
everybody wants to help me .
but usually when they find out they can &apos;t
they get frustrated and stop talking to me .
or they trick me into buying them ice cream
and then shove me into a clothes dryer .
which i didn &apos;t want to happen with you guys
so i wanted to make sure that you felt like you can help me .
the truth is lots of girls like me
because let &apos;s face it i &apos;m pretty adorable .
and my aloofness unconsciously reminds them of their fathers so ...
i &apos;m more used to them approaching me .
so we didn &apos;t damage your self @-@ esteem or anything ?
britta i got self @-@ esteem falling out of my butt .
that &apos;s why i was willing to change for you guys .
because when you really know who you are and what you like about yourself
changing for other people isn &apos;t such a big deal .
abed ...
you &apos;re a god .
if you &apos;ll all excuse me ...
i have a man to beat in pool while wearing shorts .
nice .
is that code for going number one or number two ?
abed you &apos;ve inspired me too .
people can mock me all they want .
i don &apos;t care how i say the word &quot; baggel . &quot;
&quot; baggel . &quot;
she said &quot; baggel . &quot;
would you like another one ?
&quot; baggel . &quot;
hey nice cross corner leonard .
totally .
i &apos;d like to see jeff winger try that shot
without the benefit of his stylish clothing .
oh would you ?
jeff winger .
shouldn &apos;t you be at a &quot; urban outfitters &quot; ?
i &apos;ll go there later if i feel like it .
but first i have to hand someone
their tightly polyester @-@ swaddled ass
in a game of pool .
burn .
now do you want to talk about clothes like a girl ?
or use tapered sticks to hit balls
around a cushioned table ... like a man ?
balls like a man .
rack &apos; em !
i &apos;ll break .
why ? &apos; cause it looks cool ?
i don &apos;t know .
you tell me .
get out of the way .
yeah let me just clean this side of the table off here all right ?
okay there you go . see that ? there you go .
oh yeah. yeah . what do you think of that ?
see you haven &apos;t learned anything !
except how to look cool playing pool in shorts !
you &apos;re wrong man .
i &apos;m just having a good time because i love playin &apos; pool .
liar !
you think you look cool .
yeah ?
well how cool is this ?
stop projecting your obsession with clothes onto me
as an excuse for when i beat you in a game of real pool !
oh you wanna play real pool huh ?
i &apos;ll play real pool .
now who doesn &apos;t care how they look ?
me !
shouldn &apos;t you be stopping this ?
soon soon .
just ... gathering evidence .
three to one against winger . who &apos;s on ?
yes !
oh god !
you know what jeff ?
one of us is about to win this game .
but years from now when the story &apos;s retold
all they &apos;re gonna remember
is one of us loved clothes .
and the other loved ... the game .
look at me . look at me !
you beat me .
from now on you play pool dressed however you choose .
i choose shorts .
i choose shorts !
shorts !
you son of a bitch .
you magnificent son of a bitch !
that was awesome .
let me get in here .
oh ! okay you &apos;re sweaty . all right all right .
nice game .
thanks .
look i @-@ i hope this doesn &apos;t sound too ... forward but um ...
could you introduce me to your friend ?
you know what ? i @-@ i know that guy &apos;s m.o.
and i think it &apos;s better if you introduce yourself .
okay .
hi .
hi .
courtney .
abed .
