we have a situation .
plane from erie never made it here .
mechanical problems .
there &apos;s been a change to the flight plan .
we &apos;re going to hawai &apos;i .
chin .
what are you doing here ?
have a seat , adam .
what &apos;s this about ?
just sit down .
everything okay ?
who took these ?
you told kono you were out .
you told me the same thing .
we both believed you .
i am out .
then what are you doing hanging out with goro shioma ?
you know better than i do that the man is a yakuza oyabun .
chin , two years ago ,
kono saw a photo similar to this one .
of me and riku sato , also an oyabun .
and i &apos;ll tell you exactly what i told her at the time .
it &apos;s not what you think .
i really want to believe you , adam ,
but you got to give me more than that .
look , chin , it &apos;s complicated , okay ?
it &apos;s a one @-@ way plane ticket to tokyo .
leaves tonight .
if your relationship with shioma is so complicated
that you can &apos;t explain it ,
i can &apos;t let you marry my cousin tomorrow .
i &apos;m not going anywhere , chin .
then you better convince me why i should let you stay .
okay .
goro shioma was my father &apos;s mentor .
they were as close as brothers .
when my father started his business ,
goro was the one who staked him the money
to get it off the ground .
he &apos;s made millions off that initial investment
and continues to .
look , you don &apos;t just walk away from someone like goro .
it had to be done the right way : face to face .
so , what happened ?
i offered to buy him out , but he wouldn &apos;t accept .
said the only way out was to leave
the same way my father came into the business .
with nothing .
adam , are you really willing to give up all of this for kono ?
yeah , chin .
you know your cousin .
she was never one for material things , anyway .
when was this taken ?
2 : 03 p.m. yesterday .
looks like gabriel waincroft &apos;s still on the island .
why is this guy still here ?
keep watching .
eight minutes later , he &apos;s out the door .
that &apos;s a quick visit .
enough time to pull a trigger , though .
the vic &apos;s name is seth ha &apos;anu .
now , hpd was looking at this guy for drug trafficking .
max puts his time of death
around the same time waincroft &apos;s in the building .
okay .
so he &apos;s in and out in under ten minutes .
why ? maybe , uh ...
trying to settle an old score ?
i &apos;m thinking maybe he &apos;s back in business .
he &apos;s just busy knocking off his competition .
looking for this ?
hey , sailor .
catherine .
look , i know , i should have called ,
and @-@ and i wanted to , i just ...
i didn &apos;t know what to say , so i just figured
if i just came in person that it would just be ...
thank you .
when &apos;d you get in ?
uh , this morning .
i just came straight from the airport .
who wasn &apos;t gonna miss kono &apos;s wedding , come on .
it &apos;s good to see you , cath .
you , too , steve .
listen , uh , why don &apos;t you let me dry up ,
i &apos;ll throw some civvies on and , um ,
take you out to breakfast .
we got a lot to catch up on .
yeah , i &apos;d love that .
okay , awesome , good .
yeah .
good , good , good .
give me a second , all right ?
okay .
yeah , mcgarrett .
yeah , i &apos;ll be right there .
okay .
don &apos;t go anywhere .
i won &apos;t .
duke .
g @-@ 5 made an unscheduled landing .
ground crew discovered the plane this morning ,
pilot dead inside the cockpit .
csu is processing the plane now .
okay , what else do we know about the flight ?
still working on that .
captain grover &apos;s tracing the tail numbers now .
ah , commander mcgarrett .
detective williams . good morning .
i have a tuxedo fitting ,
so i &apos;ll be making this quick .
oh , what are you doing ?
you doing powder blue ,
or , uh , crushed velvet ?
while both are valid choices ,
i will be attending kono &apos;s wedding
in a more traditional palate .
pea soup green ?
unlike you , detective williams ,
i have no insecurities when it comes to bold colors .
insecurities ?
he &apos;s right-- you hate color .
i hate color ? i don &apos;t hate color .
i like color very much . what else ?
t.o.d. was within the last 90 minutes .
your victim was shot point @-@ blank in the cranium ,
fracturing his left parietal bone ,
killing him instantly .
he was also still buckled into the captain &apos;s chair ,
which suggests he was murdered after the plane touched down .
so he was somebody &apos;s bus driver .
uh , all right , listen ,
we need to move out of here--
everybody , we got to move back .
we got to get the hell away from this plane right now .
lou , what the hell &apos;s going on ?
i just got off the phone with the department of defense ,
this plane is from garrison , north dakota .
30 minutes before the plane took off ,
there was an unmarked military convoy that was hijacked
two miles away from the airport .
wait , stop .
what was stolen ?
nukes .
they &apos;re here .
防爆小组
commander , we &apos;re picking up levels
north of 100 cpm &apos;s .
what does that mean ?
it means the nukes were definitely on that plane .
fantastic .
just relax , all right ? it &apos;s a residual radiation .
you &apos;re gonna be fine .
really ? thank you , dr. strangelove .
kono , what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re getting married tomorrow .
you don &apos;t have to be here .
i said the same thing , but she didn &apos;t listen .
look , you guys are working , and so am i.
and by the sound of things ,
we &apos;re gonna need all the help we can get .
all right , here &apos;s the latest from the department of defense .
they say that the attack team used
two vehicles and a steel cable
to literally cut the convoy in half .
payload of six w80 nuclear warheads ,
five recovered at the scene .
oh , well , there &apos;s some good news .
only one to worry about .
there &apos;s one-- you only need one .
wait a minute .
if the attack team was intending to sell the nukes ,
then why go through all that trouble
and take only one of them ?
unless that &apos;s not their endgame .
all right , look-- whoever &apos;s behind this
had to know we would track that plane back to garrison
and learn about the stolen nuke .
okay , so , either they don &apos;t care about getting caught
or they &apos;re not planning on sticking around very long .
if their goal is to sell this thing ,
i &apos;m pretty sure
they &apos;re not gonna have a hard time finding a buyer .
okay , i &apos;ll try to gather some intel ,
see if there &apos;s been any chatter about transportation
or sale of a nuclear weapon .
as soon as i hear something , i &apos;ll let you guys know .
all right , roger that . thank you .
nice to hear your voice , catherine .
you too , danny .
so , how long &apos;s she staying ?
we , uh , didn &apos;t discuss that .
was her suitcase big or @-@ or was it small ?
it was medium .
&quot; medium . &quot;
she staying with you or is she staying at a hotel
while she &apos;s here ?
we didn &apos;t discuss that , either .
anything else ?
look , i @-@ i like catherine very much , okay ?
and i &apos;m just not too happy
about the way that she left things .
and now she comes back , not so much as a phone call ...
i think that , for you , it be good to find out ,
uh , what her plans are , so she doesn &apos;t , uh , you know ,
rip your heart out again , that &apos;s all .
well , she didn &apos;t rip my heart out , danny .
she went to , uh , do what she thought was right .
right , she left you for a , for a bunch of strangers .
she went to help people in need , but like i said before ,
danny , i don &apos;t expect you to understand .
oh , &apos; cause i don &apos;t help people in need ?
that &apos;s what i do for a living . i do it every day .
i just wouldn &apos;t walk over my family members to do it .
that &apos;s a little overdramatic , even for you .
really ? &apos; cause i was gonna say something a lot worse ,
i just didn &apos;t want to hurt your feelings .
hey , hold on , hold on . i just had an idea .
why don &apos;t we talk about your relationship ?
you lied to your girlfriend , right ?
huh ? when are you gonna talk to her about that ?
wow , okay , well , i @-@ i suppose
i will talk to her when the time is right .
there you go ! now that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .
i &apos;m gonna talk to catherine when the time is right .
okay .
hey , so we caught a break .
csu lifted multiple prints from the plane
and we got a hit back on one of them .
okay , who is he ?
guy &apos;s name is josh bennett
from coshocton , ohio ,
where he lives with his wife and two kids
俄亥俄州科肖克顿县木兰街528号
and he manages a local hardware store .
according to dhs ,
he &apos;s not on any terrorist watch lists ,
and he &apos;s got no arrest record .
so , what &apos;s he doing in the system ?
well , after 9 / 11,
he tried to enlist in the marines , but he psyched out .
military jacket cites borderline personality disorder .
guy &apos;s a nut job .
could explain why he left his prints behind .
right , just the kind of guy you want running
around the island with a nuke .
hold on a second . this guy , he &apos;s a nine @-@ to @-@ fiver .
he &apos;s a family man .
what &apos;s he want with a wmd ?
military rejected him .
maybe he &apos;s still pissed off about it .
俄亥俄州科肖克顿县木兰街528号
see , the thing is that happened 14 years ago .
if he was really that angry ,
why would he wait until now to do something about it ?
all right , we need to take every scenario into consideration .
chin , do me a favor--
reach out to all the military bases on the island
and tell them they may be potential targets .
okay .
hold on , here &apos;s catherine .
yeah , cath , you &apos;re on speaker-- go .
i think i found a buyer .
i just sent you a file .
sameer hadad-- who is that ?
this guy &apos;s a high @-@ ranking lieutenant in al @-@ qaeda .
he &apos;s also on the fbi &apos;s most wanted terrorist list .
yeah , and six months ago , he tried to purchase a nuke
from a group of chechen rebels .
cia was all over it .
they sent in a seal team .
we recovered the warhead , but hadad got away .
right .
and now bennett &apos;s gonna sell him one .
looks like it .
credible sources confirm chatter
that puts hadad on oahu .
how the hell &apos;s a guy like this get on the island ?
i got my guys looking into that .
there may be a connection with a local shipping company .
listen , this is the real deal , guys .
hadad made threats against the u.s. , israel ,
europe , jordan-- we cannot let him
get off the island .
if he gets his hands on that nuke ,
you can bet he &apos;s gonna use it .
i guess we &apos;re in the right place .
moving !
clear !
took hadad three weeks to cross the pacific in this thing .
he &apos;s got enough food and water for another three weeks .
must be how he &apos;s planning to get the nuke off the island .
yo , mcgarrett !
this one &apos;s still breathing .
hey , come on , buddy , let &apos;s go !
come on , up up up , let &apos;s go !
what are , what are you doing ?
what am i doing ? it &apos;s your lucky day , buddy .
i &apos;m sending you home .
what ? !
sending you home , pal .
this container should make it back in about three weeks .
you &apos;ll probably bleed out by then .
but at least you &apos;ll be buried in the homeland .
all right , everybody , we &apos;re done here ! let &apos;s go !
wait ! let me out , please !
oh , you want to get out of here ?
yes ! please ! let me out !
you tell us where hadad is !
okay , just open it !
i &apos;ll tell you everything i know !
moving .
moving !
get up ! it &apos;s over , bennett ! get up !
boss !
we got a problem .
there &apos;s no sign of hadad or the nuke .
where is he ?
where &apos;s hadad ?
&quot; hadad &quot; ?
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re too late .
we already made the deal .
he &apos;s gone .
what &apos;s up ? you ready ?
catherine spoke to naval intel .
there &apos;s been radio silence on hadad .
yeah , well , look , we pinged his cell phone .
last signal we got was three miles out .
that was yesterday .
navy did a grid search .
the guy is @-@ is , is gone , steve .
we locked this island down , okay ?
we locked this entire island down .
how did he get out ? how did he get past us ?
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t know .
but every intelligence agency
on the planet of earth is looking for this guy .
okay ? and when they find him ,
we will have our moment with him , all right ?
yeah .
can we just , can we just take this-
this time right now , to be happy about something ?
the fact that we got bennett and his crew .
can we take that win ?
yeah . let &apos;s take the win .
yeah ? okay , good .
i &apos;m gonna go get grace . uh , she &apos;s getting ready
over at rachel &apos;s . i &apos;ll see you at the wedding .
hey , listen , if things are weird with you and rachel ,
let me go get grace . it &apos;s not a problem .
no , no , no . nothing , uh ,
nothing &apos;s weird . it &apos;s fine .
you &apos;re lying .
yes , i &apos;m lying to you , okay ?
she lied to me and didn &apos;t tell me that i had a son .
i @-@ i don &apos;t think that i will be forgiving her anytime soon .
but i got grace to worry about ,
and don &apos;t want her to see us arguing ;
she went through that before we got divorced ,
and i don &apos;t want to put her through it again .
hey , listen ... speaking of your son-- how is charlie ?
how &apos;s he doing ? what are the doctors saying ?
uh , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m the better match
for the bone marrow .
you know , procedure &apos;s gonna next week .
and , uh , the doctors are saying good things .
they &apos;re optimistic .
well , that &apos;s great news , dan .
yeah , i &apos;m making rachel tell him
that i &apos;m his father .
sticking to that .
i &apos;m proud of you , danny .
proud of me ? i &apos;m not doing anything .
look , i got the easy part .
i go in there ,
i &apos;m in and out in a couple hours .
this kid &apos;s got , uh ,
some kind of recovery , you know ?
trade places with him in two seconds .
so , you approve ?
yeah , no , i think , i think what , uh ,
my ape @-@ like friend meant to say is
that you look , uh , fantastic , right ?
he said it again . all right .
well , i &apos;m gonna let you two talk .
and maybe he &apos;ll come up with more than one syllable .
i &apos;ll see you both at the wedding ?
see you .
wow , you , you look very ,
very handsome .
thank you .
you , uh ... you look beautiful .
thank you .
so , after the wedding ...
how long you planning on staying ?
i don &apos;t know .
how long do you want me to stay ?
saved by the bell .
mcgarrett .
where ?
two surfers made the discovery about 20 minutes ago .
well , now we know how hadad got off the island .
it appears our shooter attempted to weigh him down ,
but was unsuccessful .
where &apos;d this come from ?
it was in the vic &apos;s jacket pocket .
okay , well , now we know
why his last cell phone signal
came three miles off shore .
he took this into the water with him .
what about t.o.d. ?
taking into account his current condition and liver temp ,
i &apos;d estimate between 20 to 24 hours ago .
that means he was dead before we had bennett in custody .
it also means the nuke is still on the island .
where is it ?
where is it ?
i have no idea where hadad was going .
no , that &apos;s not true .
you thought that he was going to the bottom of the pacific ocean ,
but he just washed up on shore .
so , now what ?
this was never about money , was it ?
you were always gonna set that nuke off ,
but you brokered the deal with hadad
so everybody would think he was behind it .
it &apos;s always good to put a face to your enemy , right , commander ?
thanks to me ,
hadad will be more famous than bin laden .
no , no , no .
this thing goes off ,
everybody in the world will know that you were behind it .
you really think our government
will blame this on an american ?
i &apos;ve given them a scapegoat
and they &apos;ll take it .
where &apos;s the nuke ?
i &apos;m gonna ask you one more time : where &apos;s the nuke ?
all right ...
what &apos;d i say ? what did i say ?
you can &apos;t do this !
i can do anything i want . you look at me .
it &apos;s called rendition ,
对 &quot; 假设 &quot; 有威胁的外籍公民进行绑架 关押及审讯
but it &apos;s happening in here , in this room .
60 feet underground ,
in a four @-@ foot @-@ thick cinder block box ,
so you can scream all you want ,
but nobody &apos;s going to hear you .
now answer my question .
where is that nuke ?
you remember where you were when 9 / 11 happened ?
remember what followed ?
cause and effect , commander .
we had a chance to neutralize the threat ,
but we took our boot from off of their throats and now ...
we don &apos;t feel safe anywhere .
airplanes ...
movie theaters , shopping malls ...
how are we supposed to raise our children in a country
when they &apos;re constantly looking over their shoulder ?
so what are you gonna do ?
kill thousands of innocent people to make that point ?
it &apos;s a small price to pay
to ensure the future of this country .
think of all the lives that were lost
before roosevelt finally got us into world war ii .
and that all started right here , on this island ,
at pearl harbor .
what &apos;s done is done .
by this time tomorrow ,
we &apos;ll be dropping bombs all over the middle east .
only this time ,
we &apos;re not gonna stop
until we turn that place into a parking lot .
you know what ? the military was right .
you are insane .
okay ? you &apos;re insane .
that &apos;s been said about a lot of great patriots
who had the courage to stand up for what they believe in .
you &apos;re going to tell me , right now ,
where that nuclear warhead is .
go ahead , commander .
pull the trigger .
you want to know what i did a couple days ago ?
i got up ,
i made myself a cup of coffee ,
i watched the sun rise over my backyard .
and then i went back inside
and i kissed my sleeping children and my wife
before i left the house .
so you can kill me .
i &apos;ve already said good @-@ bye to my family .
i suggest you say good @-@ bye to yours .
kono ...
save it .
there &apos;s no wedding if you guys aren &apos;t there .
guys , there may not even be an island in two hours .
i just got off the phone with los alamos national lab .
the w80 warhead that we &apos;re looking for
is a model 1 with a dial @-@ a @-@ yield setting
of between five and 150 kilotons .
okay ... which means what , exactly ?
it means that if bennett turns it up to its maximum yield ,
the blast radius will be 2.9 miles .
everything within the first mile will be completely destroyed .
also , according to los alamos ,
w80核弹头
the center of waikiki is the prime location for mass casualties .
we &apos;re talking 100,000 people in a single blast .
hold on a sec .
guys , um ,
i &apos;ve been going through a bunch
of bennett &apos;s computer files the dod sent over .
in the past few months , he &apos;s been researching oahu .
one of the web searches i came across
was for the waikiki shopping trolley
and it didn &apos;t make any sense until now .
wait a minute-- you think bennett put that nuke on the trolley ?
the pink line goes straight down kalakaua avenue ,
right into the heart of waikiki .
if bennett wanted to make a statement ,
it would be there .
guys , just spoke with waikiki trolley .
one of their drivers was found dead this morning .
but according to dispatch , his trolley left the station
on the pink line tour ten minutes ago .
that line runs straight down kalakaua ,
right into the heart of waikiki .
okay . where is it now ?
should be heading south on kalia road toward saratoga .
well , we &apos;re a block over-- hang on .
there . right there .
show me your hands , right now !
everyone out ! everybody off !
off the trolley !
everyone get out .
come to the back , here .
off , quickly !
danny ...
right here .
okay ...
all right , how do we stop it ? can you stop it ?
i don &apos;t know .
just ... hold on for a second .
the wire , if you just cut ... cut a wire .
there &apos;s no wires , danny ,
just hang on a sec .
there &apos;s always a wire .
if you just cut the wire ...
what &apos;s the matter ? huh ? huh ?
bennett has disabled the nuke &apos;s permissive action link .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
it means there &apos;s no way to stop it .
max-- looking good .
white on black tux . very tony montana .
oh . well , i was actually going for tony manero , but thank you .
&quot; jerry ortega . &quot; that &apos;s me . moment of truth .
sweet , table 13 .
a fibonacci number . that &apos;s always good luck .
i &apos;m table 13 , as well .
lucky us .
excellent .
now i guess we just gotta wait
for the rest of the scooby gang to arrive ,
and see who else is with us .
where are those guys , anyways ?
probably still dealing with the dead terrorist
and the missing nuclear weapon .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
uh , excuse me . everyone .
i have a ... an announcement to make .
uh , i just got off the phone with kono .
uh , there &apos;s been an emergency .
but she &apos;s asked that we all remain here , together ,
until we hear back from her .
thank you .
this is ridiculous .
you know there &apos;s a military team
standing by to diffuse this thing , right ?
yeah . pearl harbor is 30 minutes away , all right ?
by the time we get there ,
that thing will have gone off .
great .
she &apos;s ready to go , bruddah .
thanks .
still like to know why you need my ... bird .
is that a ... - w80 nuke .
i was gonna say bomb , but that &apos;s even worse .
oh , no . you &apos;re not gonna put that on my chopper , man .
it &apos;s bad for business .
you &apos;re not gonna have a business if we don &apos;t put this thing
on your chopper , okay ?
what ? !
be careful , man .
all right , we &apos;re airborne .
how far offshore do we need to be ?
well , according to los alamos ,
you gotta dump that thing
50 miles off shore and at a depth of 2,000 feet
to neutralize any threat of radiation .
okay , that shouldn &apos;t be a problem , right ?
no , but there &apos;s a tricky part .
based on the mass of the nuke
and the rate that it sinks ,
you &apos;re gonna have to drop that package into the water
with no less than two minutes to spare on that timer .
that might not give you enough time
to get out of the blast zone .
fantastic .
well , i guess the good news is
that dying would be better than looking
at your bald head for the rest of my life .
what are you rambling about ?
i got a nuke at my foot , okay ?
what am i rambling about ?
if we don &apos;t die , which is a gigantic if ,
i &apos;m gonna be microwaving eggs
with my finger , okay ?
nobody &apos;s gonna die , danny .
oh , really ?
look , it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s dr. strangelove-- he &apos;s back .
aren &apos;t you the one who said that residual radiation
is @-@ is not so bad , but it &apos;s the direct contact that is ?
no , i didn &apos;t say that exactly .
oh , well , you implied it .
you basically said
listen to me , just listen to me
that i &apos;m standing on the thing .
for a minute , all right ?
listen to me , all right ?
one kid is one thing , danny ,
but two kids is something else , all right ?
and g @-@ guess what , you got two kids now .
you got two kids now , and one of them needs you to go home
and do something really important for him , all right ?
so you don &apos;t get to die today ,
even though it would make my life a lot quieter .
two minutes , almost two minutes .
all right , we &apos;re almost at the 50 @-@ mile mark .
danny , you ready ?
just say when .
all right , go , now . now , danny , now .
okay , go .
go , go , g @-@ g @-@ g @-@ go .
go , go , go , go .
what happened ?
maybe it &apos;s a dud , huh ?
you all right ?
you all right ?
we &apos;re going home , buddy .
we &apos;re going home .
thanks , my bruddahs .
what , for saving your life , you mean ?
no , for destroying my business .
what are you talking about ? destroying your business ?
thing &apos;s in perfect working condition . look at that .
yeah , but nobody &apos;s gonna want to eat fish
for the next three months .
but on the bright side , it allows me
to concentrate on this .
huh , what is that ?
&quot; fun kine catamaran tours-- &quot;
def ... that &apos;s definitely on the bright side .
spread the word-- 20 % off for law enforcement .
let everybody know .
all right , buddy .
all right .
james bond , my ass .
that was close .
yeah .
well , speaking of close .
kono , you , uh , you &apos;re getting married in five minutes .
should we go ?
i think we probably should .
you look ready .
miss me ?
yes .
glad you made it , man .
you look great .
thank you .
yeah .
where &apos;s the guest of honor ?
guys ...
don &apos;t ask .
i love you .
i love you , too .
now go .
you got the rest of your life to do that .
pace yourself .
hey , all right .
the groom .
all right .
where were you ?
i was out saving the world , woman .
oh , you forgot to take the garbage out this morning .
i &apos;m just tellin &apos; you ...
got the prettiest date here .
i can &apos;t wait to get married .
don &apos;t ever say that ever again . sit down .
missed you .
i missed you , too .
you look beautiful .
mahalo .
i &apos;m gonna go sit down .
okay .
hey , you got the rings , right ?
you forgot &apos; em ?
no . no .
i left them in the car .
okay . it &apos;s not like you had anything else
to think about today , right ?
right , sorry .
i &apos;ll be back .
okay . i &apos;m not going anywhere .
what are you doing here ?
came to apologize .
i was wrong about adam .
i never meant to hurt you , chin .
everything aside , we &apos;re still family .
really ? this is how you treat family ?
you stick a gun in their face ?
you try and send them to jail ?
it was the only way that i could get to coughlin ,
get ia off your back .
and now i need you to repay the debt .
repay the debt ?
you &apos;re done , gabriel .
we got you killing coughlin and now seth ha &apos;anu .
there &apos;s no way you &apos;re getting off the island .
i &apos;ve changed my mind .
no longer planning on leaving .
you know what i do and that i &apos;m good at it .
it &apos;s only a matter of time
before you and your friends get in my way again .
so i &apos;ve come to offer you a deal .
really ?
everything that i make , you get half .
fifty @-@ fifty .
in exchange , you just stay out of my way .
that &apos;s not a deal , that &apos;s a bribe .
before you say no ...
think about it .
everyone looks at you like you &apos;re a dirty cop .
everyone . even your friends .
you don &apos;t know my friends .
oh , i don &apos;t ?
while they were getting detective williams
out of jail in colombia ...
i was the only one helping you .
you &apos;re not family to them , chin .
deep down , you know that &apos;s true .
your job has an expiration date .
what you do ,
you can only stay above ground for so long .
you know i &apos;m right .
so why not cash in ...
and make something of your pathetic life ?
as soon as you put the gun away , i &apos;m gonna arrest you .
after everything i &apos;ve done ...
... not even a thank you .
i &apos;m really disappointed in you , chin .
turn around .
this is who you are now , huh ?
you &apos;re gonna shoot a man in the back .
wouldn &apos;t be the first kelly i &apos;ve killed .
well , then you better take the shot ,
because if you don &apos;t , there &apos;s nothing that &apos;s gonna stop me
from finding you and putting you down .
then i guess i gotta do what i gotta do .
