okay . ahh .
um , my name is alex osbourne ,
and if you &apos;re watching this ,
it means i &apos;m dead .
or i &apos;m just showing you .
uh , but i &apos;m probably dead .
to my ex @-@ wife magda , i leave herpes .
but she knows that , it &apos;s dealt with .
as for my collection of styx albums ,
i leave that to no one .
because that &apos;s who appreciated styx as much as me .
finally , there &apos;s a kid named abed who makes movies
at my community college , and to him i leave the task
of creating a video tribute of my life .
what follows is some general purpose footage that he can use .
where did you get this ?
some one @-@ armed guy with a scar on his face dropped it off .
he said he was star @-@ burns &apos; lawyer .
how one @-@ armed was he ?
tell me when to stop .
it was the other arm .
you guys !
i feel oddly compelled to fulfill his request .
would you guys help me write obituary copy ?
you mean like , &quot; star @-@ burns died how he lived--
in a meth lab explosion &quot; ?
can we turn this off ?
i &apos;m not as comfortable with death as you guys .
he &apos;s in a better place now .
yeah . the blu @-@ ray shelf .
what is that ?
star @-@ burns also left me his ashes .
he requested they be burnt .
i don &apos;t think he knows how ashes work .
the small one &apos;s his lizard .
if we rub that ,
will he come out and do celebrity impressions ?
i don &apos;t think so .
then i want it out of here .
第三季第十八集
you guys , how long are we going to avoid talking
about this really serious thing that &apos;s happened ?
is it always about the holocaust with you people ?
i &apos;m talking about star @-@ burns , you know , dying .
i know it &apos;s sad , but death is a natural part of life
and by the time i finish this sentence ,
100 people will have died in china .
why ... did you stop talking ?
i have to call my pen pal .
star @-@ burns was a good man .
he barely sued me that time i ran over his foot .
i say we honor star @-@ burns by discussing him
the same amount we did when he was alive .
jeff , have some respect .
he might have been a scuzzy weirdo
who shaved his sideburns into star shapes ...
pai mai ?
it &apos;s troy . are you okay ?
okay , good , i gotta go . this costs $ 7 .
but he was also a classmate , a kinda sorta friend sometimes
and above all , a human being .
he touched all our lives .
annie has a point .
the death of a peer , especially at our age ,
can trigger a whole range of emotions .
as a psychologist ...
student .
i hereby offer my licensed ...
unlicensed .
services as a grief counselor .
grief causer .
if anyone needs to talk ,
the doctor ...
not even close .
is in .
britta , i could use some help dealing with my grief .
great .
yeah .
i was hoping you &apos;d say that ,
because ... i came prepared .
you seemed smarter than me when i met you .
thank you .
for the purposes of this exercise ,
i am star @-@ burns .
tell me the things you never got a chance to say to me .
come on , guys , you can ask me anything .
what &apos;s heaven like ?
uh , i don &apos;t know . glittery .
ask me something else .
have you seen tim russert ?
guys , you are doing this wrong .
ask me something personal .
star @-@ burns , i didn &apos;t know you that well ,
but why did you smell exactly like salami ?
abed .
i got one . where &apos;s my comb ?
i don &apos;t know .
yep , it &apos;s him .
why did you tape that switchblade to your ankle ?
why did you always poop with the stall door open ?
is it true you made out with britta ?
i don &apos;t see how that &apos;s relevant .
it was fat neil &apos;s black light party .
vicki saw you .
if that &apos;s true--
if--maybe it was because she was really drunk
and she had just found out
that her first boyfriend was getting married .
if you guys are gonna do this wrong ,
then i &apos;m gonna take these off .
okay , grief counseling is growing on me .
* come on , i &apos;m dean *
* and my hands are so clean *
* at this moment *
i am stapling
ben chang is here .
ah , send him in .
ben , how &apos;s it &quot; deaning &quot; ?
can &apos;t &quot; com @-@ chang . &quot;
just needed you to sign this .
okay .
let &apos;s just ... give this a little look @-@ a @-@ roo .
&quot; request for increased security . &quot;
&quot; cool new uniforms . &quot; i like that .
&quot; power to enact martial law , &quot; not so much .
&quot; indefinite detention , pepper spray ,
involuntary cavity searches-- no soft @-@ serve &quot; ?
all liquids and gels must be in sealed bottles
no larger than 3 ounces .
i &apos;m sorry , chang , this stuff is too extreme .
this is a community college , not an inner @-@ city high school .
it &apos;s a community college where a degenerate
just blew himself up with stolen lab equipment .
to be fair , it was the crystal meth inside
the stolen lab equipment that blew him up .
that &apos;s the problem with you civilian suits .
you want the results but you don &apos;t want
to know how the sausage gets made .
well , i &apos;ll tell you how the sausage gets made .
it &apos;s a lot of ground meat and it gets stuffed into a casing
that looks like a cross between a dude &apos;s dong and a poop .
i don &apos;t know how that helps me , but please leave .
fine , but you will regret this .
i doubt it .
this just came for you .
great .
i have to give more bad news to jeff and his study group .
hold my calls , i have to pick an outfit .
who wants to dance ?
nice work , everyone .
now think about that last little puppy in that basket
out of all those puppies .
and now ... he &apos;s catching fire too .
britta ! why are you making us feel these things ?
we need to bring our emotions to the surface
and explore them .
does it always have to be puppies though ?
oh , come on , everybody .
this is a completely unnecessary process .
what jeff &apos;s doing right now is called denial
and it is the first of five stages of grief
that ends with acceptance .
name any other stage .
what are you , my final ?
maybe we don &apos;t need grief counseling .
but seems like the least we could do is have a memorial or something .
oh , yes , we could have a little service
and i could bring some of my brownies
and i guess someone should sing ave maria .
i mean , i can do it . whatever .
sure , why not drag it out for weeks ?
why not wallow for the rest of our lives
and never get anything done ?
or we could just admit the simple fact that one day ,
something is in your life and one day , it &apos;s not .
dean @-@ jour , mes amis !
unfortunately , due to the whole star @-@ burns meth lab explosion ,
professor kane has resigned ,
and you biology class has been can @-@ can @-@ cancelled .
your grade is now an incomplete .
you &apos;ll have to make up the credit in the summer .
my summer is gone ?
no .
no !
well , i had a little rockette kick @-@ line thing planned , but ...
okay .
that was garrett singing , um , ave maria ?
ave maria !
uh , now , shirley , i understand you wanted to sing something as well ?
no , thank you .
okay , then let &apos;s move on to the eulogies .
does anyone have anything they wanna say
in the memory of star @-@ burns ?
because his sideburns were shaped like stars .
i just got it . i just got that .
anything at all .
this is a safe place to say what you &apos;re feeling .
i &apos;ll say something .
after learning about star @-@ burns &apos; death ,
i personally went through the stages of grief
and have now arrived at the final one-- acceptance .
closure !
acceptance that this place ...
this fallujah of higher learning ...
is a prison from which none of us will ever escape .
okay , jeffrey , now we &apos;re mixing metaphors here--
and it turns out ...
that star @-@ burns , this man in this urn ,
was a hero to us the whole time
because he did the one thing that none of us ever tried to do .
he got out .
and then he exploded .
because greendale hates its students .
no . no .
it sucks the lives from their bodies
and forces their desiccated husks to attend summer school .
okay , jeffrey , this is a funeral .
let &apos;s keep it light .
annie , annie , maybe you could say something nice about star @-@ burns .
get some sugar to go with that spice .
star @-@ burns or alex , as he like to be called ,
was a human being .
a greendale human being ...
like me .
i &apos;ve given this place my childhood ,
my enthusiasm , and my loyalty ,
and in return , greendale has warped me
like a barbie in a microwave .
our school flag is an anus !
you were the guys who drew it .
we &apos;re not even the best community college in our community .
let that sink in .
and the cherry on top on this total lack of sundae--
i &apos;m failing a remedial biology class on a technicality
all because you don &apos;t know how to run a school .
oh , that &apos;s--
shame on you , dean .
shame ... on ... you !
edison out .
let &apos;s maybe not drop the $ 50 mics , okay , guys ?
shirley , you love jesus .
i think we all could use some good old @-@ fashioned religion right now .
well , uh , all right .
um , star @-@ burns , i &apos;m told ,
um , was a drug dealer .
which , of course , is not good behavior .
which--but he-- it was a business .
um , he had an entrepreneurial spirit .
amen .
i had an entrepreneurial spirit .
i had dreams .
dreams of opening a sandwich shop in this cafeteria .
and greendale listened to those dreams ...
and stole them ...
and sold them to subway .
worst wake ever .
i &apos;m starting to get nervous about this .
yep , it &apos;d be nice to have some protection , right ?
think maybe it &apos;s about time you signed this ?
just promise me you &apos;ll use restraint .
yep . every type we got .
gentlemen !
all hail chang !
this is the day we &apos;ve been waiting for .
suit ... up !
when i say greendale , you say sucks
greendale .
sucks .
greendale .
sucks .
greendale .
sucks .
greendale .
sucks .
peace .
no , no , no , no , no , no , oh , no , you don &apos;t .
look , i don &apos;t know how this got out of hand either .
but as a student who &apos;s been at greendale for over a decade ,
i think i &apos;ve earned the right to say a few final words .
let him talk !
i &apos;m sorry .
thank you , thank you .
let &apos;s burn this mother down !
helter skelter !
no , no , no !
i &apos;m gonna take everything but onions and olives .
i know my comb &apos;s in here , you son of a bitch !
look , tiny riot gear .
it &apos;s so peppery !
strange ,
i &apos;m not finding any pepper spray on you .
well , check harder .
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m crying because i was chased
by the gang of scary 12 @-@ year @-@ olds .
no entry , we &apos;re guarding general chang &apos;s prisoners .
okay , this is my school ,
and i will enter whatever i want .
well , subway has threatened to pull out of greendale
and the school board is furious .
tomorrow , they are having a hearing to investigate
the ringleaders of the riot ,
aka the greendale seven .
catchy .
how about pierce hawthorne and the greendale six ?
pierce !
how about the greendale five ?
i &apos;m such a bad dean .
no , you &apos;re not .
well , you are .
but ...
we &apos;re worse students .
while you tried to save greendale ,
we trashed the school like a tv commercial
where the teacher banned skittles .
that &apos;s sweet of you to say , jeffrey .
but it doesn &apos;t change the fact that we &apos;re all ted danson
at whoopie goldberg &apos;s roast .
又名 《 精子奇缘 》
what if we all back each other up to the board
and explain the we were all experiencing
&quot; funeral crazies &quot; ?
i can say that &apos;s a thing because i &apos;m a psych major .
ugh , they &apos;re still going to need a fall guy .
how about the crazy man who ...
commanded a bunch of preteens
to spray poison in our faces ?
you know what ?
it was right under our noses , wasn &apos;t it ?
group hug ...
where i &apos;m between jeff and troy .
here we go--oop , you &apos;re walking away from the hug .
hey there , ben .
would you mind scooching from my desk ?
got some testimony to prepare
for the school board meeting tomorrowsies .
that testimony wouldn &apos;t happen to involve
pinning the riot on me .
ben , i &apos;m sorry , but this has gone too far .
i regret issuing those extraordinary powers to you .
i regret letting this child army get out of hand .
i regret giving you that unasked for adult back rub
when you were asleep that once .
i think we &apos;re gonna have to let you go .
nuh @-@ uh , ain &apos;t happening .
i always knew this day would come .
now the only person getting replaced around here is you .
oh , my god , it &apos;s me .
ugh ! i will--
the single worst wake riot this district has ever seen .
and we &apos;ve seen our share .
tables , chairs , floors , ceilings , all affected .
a campus already in mourning is pushed into chaos .
and sitting here facing me now ,
the so @-@ called greendale seven ...
reportedly responsible for inciting
the entire chain of events .
this is some pretty serious stuff .
sir ... although my friends and i
behaved somewhat irresponsibly ,
we shouldn &apos;t forget about the circumstances on campus .
we had just lost a classmate .
and a lizard ...
your majesty .
it was an emotional time
and we acted emotionally .
but the real question is , how did the school respond ?
the riot was exacerbated
by the school security staff &apos;s
heavy @-@ handed and , frankly , insane response .
hey , everyone .
oh , so sorry to pop in like this .
i really hope i &apos;m not interrupting .
just wanted to see how everything &apos;s going ,
and those are for you fellas .
i never forget a face or a favorite cookie .
and i brought extras , because i know how richie
got into that last basket i brought .
probably good to have a backup .
i did . i did get into them pretty good .
so everything going okay ?
or are you guys going to trash this building too ?
yeah , we were just going over the charges .
seems like you had your hands full with these individuals .
this is crazy .
you guys are really buying this ?
excuse me ?
chang is a psychopathic wannabe warlord
with an army of prepubescent thugs .
he was living in the school &apos;s air vent system
with a monkey !
that &apos;s not--
well , where &apos;s the dean ? he &apos;ll tell you .
hey , guys . can &apos;t stay , gotta run ,
but , uh , these troublemakers have got to go .
i think i &apos;ve heard enough ,
and i don &apos;t see what choice i have .
greendale seven ...
jeff winger ,
annie edison ,
pierce hawthorne ,
britta perry ,
shirley cennet ,
abed nadir ,
troy barnes ,
you are hereby expelled from greendale community college .
may god have mercy on your souls .
rusty bucket ? rusty bucket ?
rusty bucket ?
yep .
okay , transform and roll out .
13 years of college down the drain .
i was gonna be the first one in my family
to graduate from community college .
everyone else graduated from normal college .
now they &apos;re really gonna give me a hard time .
you &apos;re drinking ?
yeah , well , my life can &apos;t get double ruined .
can &apos;t believe we &apos;re expelled .
greendale was our home .
britta , isn &apos;t it time for you to explain
that every failure is also an opportunity ?
whatever , i &apos;m the worst .
i &apos;m also the worst .
not gonna argue , but i am gonna forgive you .
that &apos;s the pizza .
roll a die to see who gets it ?
i &apos;ll get it .
you guys remember our housewarming party ?
what would have happened if i had just let jeff
roll the die that night ?
i assumed this was the best timeline ,
but what if it &apos;s the darkest ?
well , i don &apos;t think anyone knows what you &apos;re talking about ,
but it does seem like things couldn &apos;t get any worse .
no .
we &apos;re all gonna get through this .
we &apos;re all alive and we &apos;re all fine .
and britta , you &apos;re not the worst .
you &apos;re the best .
he &apos;s right . things are bad .
but we &apos;re together .
that makes this the perfect timeline .
wait . there are other timelines ?
pizza time .
