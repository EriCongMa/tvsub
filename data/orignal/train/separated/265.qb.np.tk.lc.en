what are you doing back so early ?
did chestnut forget his wallet ?
no , we saw that cat we don &apos;t like .
i tried to spray it with a water bottle ,
but it just laughed at us , so we ran .
what are you doing out here ?
enjoying the day .
the coming of autumn is my favorite time of year .
i love the leaves .
oh , gross ! a condom !
wow , i guess autumn really is coming .
who would throw that over our wall ?
that cat .
what ? he &apos;s not only arrogant ,
he wants us to know he has sex .
all i know is , if i had nine lives ,
i wouldn &apos;t wear a condom .
hey , you know , we should start figuring out
what to do with chestnut this winter ,
now that it &apos;s already peak condom dropping season .
you &apos;re right , chestnut is the most important thing .
but more importantly , what do you think
of this vintage sweater i chose for my date with andy ?
it &apos;s nice .
but won &apos;t it be hard to pull off over your head in the cab ?
i &apos;m assuming you &apos;ll do it in a cab .
max , it &apos;s a first date . that &apos;s not appropriate .
is it ?
i mean , i &apos;ve never dated poor .
what is acceptable on a first date ?
well , i &apos;m pretty classy , so anal ?
i &apos;m not that poor .
well , you better give him something to keep him interested
because he owns a candy store ,
and i want free candy forever .
there he is .
can you bring him out in the yard ,
so he can see me in my sweater next to my horse ?
okay , freak .
but next time a guy comes knocking for me ,
you have to take him to my bedroom ,
so he can see me in my slayer shirt
next to my glo worm filled with pot .
hello , sir , i &apos;m here to pick up your daughter .
and what exactly are your intentions ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe take her on a romantic hayride ,
k &apos;nock her out with chloroform ,
and sell her kidney for a new ipad .
son !
come outside .
miss channing wants you to see her looking like the girl
who got cut from the j.crew catalog for being too white .
miss channing ? max , whoa , whoa , whoa , wait .
caroline is caroline channing caroline channing ?
yeah , she used to be a billionaire ,
but now all her money is in here .
oh , wait , some of these are buttons .
oh . okay .
yeah , i just thought she was a regular williamsburg girl .
no . she doesn &apos;t try that hard .
and i was wrong .
oh , hi . i didn &apos;t hear you knock .
well , you two have a good time .
and , young man , if you don &apos;t swing by your store
and bring me some pixie sticks ,
you &apos;ll never see my little girl again .
way ahead of you .
yes !
yeah , definitely anal .
oh , baby .
look who &apos;s a half hour late for work .
must have been a pretty hot date with the candy man .
so did you touch his whatchamacallit ?
did you bring him to almond joy ?
his butterfingers got nowhere near my mounds .
now , if we could be adults for a second--
well , your mounds are more like sno @-@ caps ,
but continue .
well , nothing happened .
even after four hours of me breathing heavily and saying ...
&quot; i &apos;m having a really good time &quot;
look , i don &apos;t want to be this girl , but i think--
think he might be gay .
he &apos;s gay because he &apos;s not turned on
by four hours of coffee breath ?
what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m having a really good time .
i must go to the men &apos;s room right now .
that proves nothing .
oleg is always looking for an excuse to put it somewhere .
why do you think we don &apos;t serve bagels anymore ?
andy is not gay .
and i &apos;m not just setting you up for a life of confusing ,
self @-@ questioning non @-@ sex for the free candy ,
although that does sound like me .
he is really into you .
he might be into me ,
but he doesn &apos;t seem to want to get into me .
maybe he just wants me as a friend .
no way .
you are , like , 80 pounds and a coke addiction shy
from being qualified to be a gay guy &apos;s female friend .
what &apos;s so important you two have to be in here
gabbing like schoolgirls when there are customers waiting ?
if you must know ,
caroline and i were discussing if someone we know is gay .
i once had a homosexual experience in college .
with another girl ?
no , there was a boy who was interested in me .
he was captain of the football team .
he would come to my dorm room
and ask me to do his homework ,
and then he would leave .
oh . never mind .
i never had a homosexual experience .
keep wearing those sweaters , han .
it &apos;ll happen .
and if you think your life sucks now ,
it just got worse .
look , a new hipster strain .
ironic amish .
拒绝汽车及电力等现代设施 过着简朴的生活
no way . i &apos;m taking care of
these two butter churners right now .
look , i &apos;m telling you what i told mumford and sons ,
get out .
go .
go , you hipster amish wannabes .
but we really are amish .
yes , we &apos;re here on rumspringa .
and i &apos;m here on a little bit of vodka .
it &apos;s sort of like what you might call spring break .
we get to leave the ways of the amish
and experience the modern world .
well , i beggeth thy forgiveness .
haveth a seat @-@ eth in the booth @-@ eth .
have a seat in the booth .
earl , i got two amish in my booth .
well , you let them know right up front
that we don &apos;t accept travelers checks or livestock .
so amish , huh ?
yes , ma &apos;am . from pennsylvania .
&quot; ma &apos;am &quot; ?
you know what , that &apos;s kind of hot .
i always thought i &apos;d have to wait
20 more years to be a cougar ,
but , rawr , here i am .
why don &apos;t i bring you boys some coffee , on me ?
we can &apos;t drink coffee , ma &apos;am .
coffee is the devil in a cup .
we can do whatever we want , jacob ,
we &apos;re in new york .
yeah , jacob . listen to , uh--
jebediah .
for real ?
did you see the size of her nursers ?
those guys are for real amish .
i love the amish culture .
you love every culture .
you salute the flags at ihop when we walk by .
oh , my god . that &apos;s it .
max , question .
what are the amish known for ?
oh , no . it &apos;s sixth grade all over again .
just give me an &quot; f &quot; and move on .
barns . they build barns , and we--
we need a barn for chestnut .
come on . and let me do the talking .
i am very good at manipulating young boys .
i once got a ten @-@ year @-@ old i was babysitting
to buy me a box of pop @-@ tarts with his allowance .
so this is our place . not much , but--
you have so many possessions .
are you rich , ma &apos;am ?
yes .
and i have to say , this &quot; ma &apos;am &quot; thing
is still working for me .
um , okay , jacob . that &apos;s enough with the lights .
there will be plenty of time for fun with electricity tomorrow ,
but it &apos;s late .
let &apos;s discuss sleeping arrangements .
you two can sleep out here ,
and max and i will sleep in her bed .
does that work for you ?
okay .
oh , sorry . i left my bra .
your @-@ your b @-@ b @-@ bra ?
jacob , stop acting like a child .
i &apos;m sorry about him .
don &apos;t be .
at least it was her bra .
mine would have killed the kid .
so i was thinking we could drive our truck
to my uncle &apos;s lumberyard in the morning
and get the wood for the barn .
okay , but there seems to be plenty of wood right here .
oh , hello .
don &apos;t be embarrassed , jacob .
it &apos;s perfectly natural when you &apos;re exposed to new things .
the first time i saw a picture of those fat twins on scooters ,
i was hard for days .
why don &apos;t you two go outside and play with the horse ?
okay .
and thank you for letting us stay at your place .
your home is dope .
you don &apos;t even know what that means , jebediah .
it &apos;s hipster talk , jacob , and it &apos;s awesome .
are we sure this is a good idea ?
you saw how turned on he was .
he was practically raising a barn in his pants .
we &apos;re fine , they &apos;re fine .
just a typical male reaction
to a couple of hot cougars like us .
ra . rawr .
you know what isn &apos;t a typical male reaction ?
not calling or texting a girl you &apos;re interested in .
well , why don &apos;t you just text andy , then ?
what should i text ?
&quot; why so gay , question mark &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know .
the only thing i &apos;ve ever texted to a guy is ,
&quot; there &apos;s a cop behind you , walk past me . &quot;
just say &quot; hey . &quot;
okay . i can do that .
&quot; hey . &quot;
huh , it autocorrected to &quot; gay . &quot;
even the phone &apos;s getting that vibe .
there , sent it . &quot; hey . &quot;
do you think i could grab a beer ?
yes .
no .
look , they &apos;re working for us for free .
one beer each .
awesome , awesome , awesome .
max , you can &apos;t give underage kids beer in our home .
why ? isn &apos;t that what love is ?
jebediah , beer is the devil &apos;s saliva .
neighbors come a @-@ calling after midnight in williamsburg ?
where is this william ?
i &apos;d like to compliment him on his burg .
hi , girls , i just came down for a cupcake--
wait a minute , wait a minute .
hold on .
who are the two cute puppies in the kitchen ?
look at you two .
you are the cutest little things .
yes , you are--
ooh , and this one has an erection .
jacob , don &apos;t look directly at her .
she &apos;s like an eclipse with boobs .
sorry , girls .
i didn &apos;t mean to interrupt your lovers &apos; session .
sophie , they &apos;re just here to build a barn for chestnut .
oh , sure . wink , wink .
&quot; building a barn , &quot; is that what we &apos;re calling it now ?
wink , wink .
caroline &apos;s telling the truth , sophie .
it &apos;s strictly business .
oh , so you &apos;re paying for them ?
okay . ooh la la .
how much do they cost ?
because , yeah , i also need a barn .
wink , wink .
well , here &apos;s your cupcake , sophie . good night .
oh , but i want to play with the puppies .
it &apos;s very late .
you can come back in the morning .
this is like when they cancelled christmas in my village .
look , look at his pants . that one misses me .
nighty night , puppies .
that must be andy .
emojis ? he sent me emojis ?
all i get back are tiny , little pictures ,
when i spent the time and energy to write &quot; hey &quot; ?
rainbow , dollar sign , muffin . could be worse .
i once got naked guy , naked girl , tombstone .
i wasn &apos;t sure what it meant , but i immediately got tested .
yep , chestnut , pretty soon you &apos;ll be safe and sound ,
with a roof over your head ,
and you and i can finally be safe
from the unending torment of that condom @-@ throwing cat .
all ready for my second date .
slut , party of one .
slut , party of one .
you know it .
plus , i &apos;m taking him to that bar
where only cheap girls go to get laid .
you know , the one you like .
oh , the just slip it inn ?
and if that place plus this outfit
doesn &apos;t put his pedal to my metal ,
it &apos;s clearly never happening .
well , that outfit &apos;s sexy , but not foolproof .
oh , it &apos;s not ? follow me , please .
jacob .
and i &apos;m not saying i &apos;m that hot ,
but i &apos;ve never seen anybody drop wood
and get wood at the same time .
bye , baby , mama &apos;s going to get day @-@ laid .
hey , max .
would it be okay if we take our shirts off ?
we &apos;re sweating , and--
yes .
i mean , that &apos;s @-@ sure , whatever .
if you want to .
oh , crap . i don &apos;t have any ones .
could you spray me with that water bottle ?
oh , right . oh , i &apos;m going to spray you .
is that really what you think is going to happen ?
i &apos;m going to spray you , and then i &apos;m going to get turned on ,
and then i &apos;ll start spraying stutter stud over there ,
and then we &apos;re all having sex ?
no , max . i got him .
here you go , puppies .
oh , now i wet the shy one .
oh , and , boys , i &apos;m going to need you to come up here next
and fix something because it broke .
what &apos;s broken ?
that .
look at the couple behind us .
i mean , save some for the men &apos;s room stall ,
am i right ?
i &apos;m having a really good time .
what ?
i &apos;m having a really good time !
i think we need more drinks .
would you like a jack and coke ?
or maybe just a jack ?
oh , no , if you &apos;re calling me , then the date &apos;s not going well .
i &apos;m not crazy , right ?
he did hunt me down and beg me to go out with him ?
nothing again ?
well , maybe he &apos;s not feeling that place .
well , then he &apos;s the only one ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s so horny here , i &apos;m about to have sex
with the couple at the next table ,
and they &apos;re both redheads , which is so gross .
hold on a second . um , hey , guys ?
yeah ?
perfect , thanks .
i mean , why did he even ask me out again ?
well , i kind of might have said s--
max ! now i &apos;m even more humiliated .
you forced a gay guy to go out with me ?
who am i ? the girl with lupus at the prom ?
andy is not gay .
he hasn &apos;t said one mean thing about strangers
while i &apos;ve been around him .
well , then he &apos;s paralyzed from the waist down
and hides it by walking .
okay , that &apos;s it . i &apos;m leaving .
no , don &apos;t , i &apos;ll come there . maybe it &apos;ll help .
you two were really hot when i was standing between you .
true . okay , and hurry .
i don &apos;t want to go home with the redheads .
why do they even let them in here ?
leaving here is probably a good idea anyway .
if i stay any longer , i &apos;m going to do something
i &apos;ll have to pretend to regret .
how weird running into you guys here .
my favorite bar that i come to all the time just &apos; cause .
hi , andy . these guys are our friends .
we &apos;re amish .
awesome band name .
why did you bring them ?
i was afraid to leave them home .
sophie was running out of things to break in her apartment .
so what are you guys drinking ?
beer .
shut it , jacob , or i will smite thee .
wait , uh , i &apos;ll go with you .
fyi , i &apos;m leaving with the redheads in five minutes .
hi , can i get a pitcher of tap , please ?
would you like to dance , caroline ?
oh , thank you . but that is so not my thing .
and besides , that &apos;s not so much a dance floor
as an std mosh pit .
awesome .
so she called you , right ?
i saw her talking on the phone using lots of hand gestures .
i figured it was about how bad the date is .
okay , i &apos;m going to try and put this as politely as i can ,
but what the hell is wrong with you ?
make a move .
max , i really like her , but ...
what is the but ?
but she &apos;s caroline channing .
and you &apos;re andy something . so ?
yeah , i &apos;m andy something who owns a small candy store ,
and she was practically a princess .
was . was a princess .
now she has five pairs of underwear
and hasn &apos;t done laundry in eight days .
max , honestly , i mean , i use those stupid emojis
to buy time to figure out what i wanted to say .
that &apos;s why emojis exist .
so guys like me don &apos;t have to say ,
&quot; i &apos;m not good enough . i sell gum . &quot;
she &apos;s the same girl you met in your candy store .
no , she &apos;s not .
that was just a regular , pretty williamsburg girl .
now , she &apos;s refined , rich caroline channing .
he thinks you &apos;re rich and refined .
it &apos;s a real boner blocker .
what ?
he found out who you were , and he &apos;s intimidated .
you have to act cheap and unrefined .
it &apos;s the only way .
here we go .
i also ordered you guys some nachos .
no jalapenos .
i know that &apos;s the devil &apos;s garnish .
great , nachos .
they &apos;re so low @-@ rent like me .
but first , i &apos;m going to chug some draft beer
like i always do .
and now i &apos;m gonna freak @-@ dance .
slut , party of one
come on , jacob . i &apos;m going to tear that ass up .
y @-@ y @-@ you are ?
see ? that &apos;s not special at all .
oh , my god !
call the paramedics .
i danced an amish boy to death .
look at poor jacob . i feel awful .
it was just panic attack coupled with his first orgasm .
paramedics said he &apos;ll be fine .
i think that &apos;s what they said .
it was hard to hear over all their laughing .
more emojis from andy .
christmas tree , fireworks , martini glass .
okay , that &apos;s it . i &apos;m done .
well , here he comes .
what is this supposed to mean ?
oh , that ? that means ...
i love emojis .
i think my work here is done .
max , i &apos;m going to go with jacob in that thing
we wouldn &apos;t let take our grandmother .
and i just wanted to say good @-@ bye
and thank you for everything .
well , you built us a barn ,
we almost killed your friend @-@ i &apos;d say we &apos;re even .
well , jacob says he &apos;s going to go home ,
but i met this girl in the bar
whose roommate overdosed yesterday ,
so there &apos;s a spare room ,
and i &apos;ve decided to stay .
cool .
so got any words of wisdom
for a kid trying to make it in the world ?
no , do you ?
look , just know you &apos;re going to struggle for a while .
someone &apos;s going to ask you what time it is ,
and when you look at your watch ,
he &apos;s going to put his penis on you .
but like dan savage says , it gets better .
发起了 &quot; 明天会更好 &quot; 反自杀活动的专栏作家
although it hasn &apos;t for me ,
so maybe that only applies to questioning teens .
in short , there &apos;s really no point to anything ,
but sometimes , you get to eat candy or have sex ,
and that &apos;s when it all feels right .
oh , no .
caroline , the cat .
i &apos;m on my own . fine .
oh , no , you bastard , not tonight .
it is not going down tonight .
all right , you win this one .
