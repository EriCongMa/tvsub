I'm kind of worried about Jesus.
He found our birth dad. The guy's a sex offender.
与未成年发生猥亵下流行为
He's on that list because of me.
I was 15, he was 18.
He showed up at my work site like this.
You have got to keep your son away from me.
Why are you sending Connor away?
Connor asked to go live with his mom.
Mommy!
Brandon, this is Eddie, Mason's father.
We got all the plants and materials donated
thanks to Monte!
She's an incredible young woman, isn't she?
Monte kissed me.
Why can't we have two parties?
Jesus...
Hey, look who I found.
Thought I could drive you to school.
Hey, bubba, I went ahead and printed out your train ticket to LA.
Awesome, thank you.
You're welcome.
And I've gotta go, early meeting.
Good luck.
Thank you.
How happy are you?
Someone's gonna see his boyfriend.
I'm super happy.
It just sucks that I'm gonna miss your party.
What's to miss?
Hey!
He's just pouting
because we can't afford to rent a skate park for his birthday.
Hey, if it wasn't Connor's homecoming,
I'd go a different weekend.
You haven't seen him in forever. Totally forgiven.
Yeah, we'll have a family dinner when you get home, babe.
Hey, you wanna use the warehouse?
For what?
The skate park.
Really?
Yeah.
You can build some ramps out of plywood and stuff.
What... wait, no.
I'm using the warehouse to rehearse R&J,
and I already got the downstairs taped off...
And it wouldn't cost you anything.
Yeah? And your folks would be okay with that?
Oh, 100 percent. Dad's just stoked someone's actually using it.
What about my dance party?
No, this is my year.
Well, we can do both.
I mean, we can turn the first floor into the skate park,
and we can do your dance party upstairs.
But the sets are upstairs.
Happy?
Uh, no.
Yeah.
All right. I will allow it.
But everyone has to be super careful around the sets.
How many people can we invite?
Not too many.
I was just planning on ordering some pizza
and inviting like, five or six dudes, you know?
No girls, no drama.
Sexist much?
Look, I'm just trying to avoid quinceañera: The sequel.
Hey, that's my phone.
What?
Uh, nothing. You just... You got a text from Connor.
Looks like someone's pretty excited
to see you this weekend, huh?
Okay, you guys all need to get off!
Let's go! Look at the time!
Hey, Callie.
Um, is A.J., uh... Is he coming to the party?
I don't know. I think Mariana's inviting him.
Okay.
Are you bringing...
Cort? Oh, no. I'm not inviting her.
I thought it'd be uncomfortable.
Yeah. I get it.
I mean, we're gonna have to get used to
seeing each other with other people, right?
Do we?
I mean, I, um...
I saw you and A.J. kissing out back.
I was in the garage.
Don't feel weird or anything.
I just think it'd be better you know, if...
if we didn't bring other people home or to family stuff.
Yeah, okay.
Okay.
So, Sally Benton came to see me yesterday.
Oh, well, if she's upset that
we're letting Brandon do Romeo and Juliet off-campus,
She's just gonna have to get over it.
No, well, she was upset,
but it wasn't about that.
She's upset because she... she said that you kissed her.
You didn't kiss her, did you?
No, I didn't kiss a student.
However, Sally tried to kiss me.
What? Why?
I have no idea, Lena.
Maybe she misinterpreted my interest in her
as a mentor as something else.
Considering our history,
I can only imagine what you're thinking.
Why didn't you report this?
Oh, I made it very clear
what she did was inappropriate and unwelcome,
and I didn't see the need to embarrass her any further.
What were you thinking?
You know that any indiscretion
between a student and a teacher or administrator
has to be reported to the school board immediately.
Sally's 18, so there's no legal issue.
There's no obligation to inform her parents.
What about the ethical issue?
I was considering the ethical issue
by choosing not to humiliate the girl.
Frankly, I know how that feels.
Why is she saying that you kissed her?
Maybe she thought I'd tell her parents.
Well, she told her parents.
So we are going to have to deal with this
even if she is 18.
Have you ever had sex?
Uh, well, yeah.
Are you asking 'cause of that text from Connor?
Were you guys, you know, thinking about hooking up this weekend?
I wasn't.
But what, you thought... you think maybe Connor was?
I don't know what he's thinking.
How did you, like, learn how to do stuff?
Like everybody else. Porn online.
Right.
So, I mean,
if you need to do some research,
or have a little bit of Jude time...
Put a hat on the door?
No. No, that's my thing.
Uh, here.
From now on, sock on the door
means keep out, Jude time.
You want us to write a letter
supporting the man who got you pregnant and addicted to drugs?
Now I know why you wanted to just meet me,
and not papa.
I thought he'd hear it better from you.
You're home now. And you're doing so well.
I don't understand
why you would want to open up all these old wounds.
Helping Gabe was my idea.
Why?
Because I think...
I think it would mean a lot to Jesus,
Just like it meant a lot for me to get to know Ana,
To have that chance, at least.
But he can't as long as Gabe is on that registry,
Because, legally, Gabe can't even be around minors.
Or live within 500 feet of a school.
And you know how hard it is to get a job when you're on that list?
He doesn't deserve it, mama.
He was an adult.
He knew what he was doing.
He was 18.
And we were in love.
And it was consensual.
Did Gabe put you up to this?
No, he...
He doesn't even know we're having this conversation.
So how do you even know he wants your help?
What about your mothers?
They approve of you involving yourself in this?
My moms believe in second chances.
You know, like the one we all gave Ana.
So you'll talk to papa?
What's wrong?
It's just Mike's gonna be home soon, so I should probably go.
Uh, okay.
I guess I'll see you at the party.
Oh, you're gonna go?
Um, listen,
you totally don't have to,
you know, if you're busy or whatever.
It's probably gonna be lame.
Lame?
Not according to Mariana's e-vite.
A skate park and a dance party?
That sounds cool to me.
So, you're like, an amazing skater, or something?
Nah.
But I do know my way around a dance floor.
Plus, it'll give me a chance to show you my moves.
Unless you're not interested in seeing my moves?
Oh, I am interested.
Good.
But if you wanna keep up, you better brush up on yours.
Hey, I should get back.
My break was over, like, ten minutes ago.
Wait, maybe you could, like, take a night off?
We could, like, go on a real date.
Well, I'm working the early shift tomorrow,
And Eddie's supposed to have Mason.
Tomorrow I have a family thing that I have to get to.
But maybe I could come over after?
I kind of have this rule about bringing guys home.
You know, 'cause of Mason.
I'm just not that mom.
Yeah, no. I mean, totally.
I respect that.
But won't Mason be with his dad?
Well, yeah, but...
my place is kind of a mood killer.
I mean, tripping over building blocks and sippy cups?
Not hot.
Right. Right.
Um, well, you know, the party won't actually be at the house.
So, no one's gonna be home.
Maybe I could sneak away a little early.
We could hang out there.
Are you sure?
Yeah, it's gonna be like, a typical high school party anyway.
And I'm so over that.
Of course you are. You're very mature.
Oh, I am very mature.
Monte created this situation
where she could be alone with this girl.
You know, a girl that you claim she builds up,
gives special treatment,
which is classic grooming behavior.
I'm just...
just saying how well do you really, really know Monte?
Come in.
Do you, uh...
can you guys get a refund on the train ticket?
Why?
Oh, well, I don't wanna miss the party.
But isn't Connor's homecoming this weekend?
Uh, yeah, but he has football.
So, I'd just be sitting in the bleachers bored.
I can go another time. If that's cool.
Something happen?
No. No.
All right.
Well, if you're sure about it, we'll see what we can do.
And if we, you know, can't get a refund, I can...
do chores or something to pay you guys back.
Okay. Thank you.
First, let me assure you that we are taking this very seriously,
and I want to be as sensitive to Sally as possible.
The protocol in a situation like this
is to bring principal Porter and Sally
in front of the school board, separately of course,
to tell their sides of the story.
What do you mean "sides of the story"?
What is Ms. Porter saying happened?
She is saying that Sally initiated the kiss,
a kiss that she refused.
That's not true.
Our daughter has a boyfriend.
And, might I add, Ms. Porter is a self-described bisexual.
Where did you get that idea?
Sally found Ms. Porter's profile on some dating website
soliciting men and women.
The term is "seeking," Not "soliciting."
Whatever the case,
our daughter's not going in front of any board.
Incidents like these follow people,
and Sally has worked too hard
to have her reputation called into question.
I'm sorry if Sally's not willing to tell her story.
I'm not exactly sure how you want us to handle this.
We'd like to see Ms. Porter fired.
She can't be fired without documented cause.
Well, I'd try to find a cause if I were you,
before you allow her to ruin the reputation of this school.
In the meantime, make sure she stays away from our daughter.
Sally.
Do you remember me?
Uh, yeah, of course.
What about me?
Tried to get off the list a few years back.
You know, didn't happen.
Talked to a lawyer, she said it was almost impossible.
Impossible if you don't have a letter of support from the...
from Ana and her parents,
the people who called the cops on you in the first place.
Your folks are willing to do that?
I think they will be.
So you haven't asked them?
They're thinking about it.
But I can be very persuasive.
Everyone thinks I should be a lawyer one day.
Well, I mean, I...
I don't have money for one now, so...
You don't need one.
All you have to do is fill
out this petition for a pardon and submit it
along with the letters of support from Ana and her parents.
Why are you doing all this?
You know, trying to get me off the list?
Does there have to be a reason?
Can I think about it?
Sure. Whatever you want.
Oh, um, I have to go.
It's my birthday... or our birthday.
Oh, I...
Uh, happy birthday.
Thanks.
Ana?
I think I'm gonna stick around for a bit, to catch up.
Right. So then I'll see you tonight at the party?
Uh, hey, tell Jesus happy birthday.
Sure. I'll do that.
So...
Ha. Yeah.
Um, can I get you one?
Nick did all this? Really?
I know, right. He's major.
Oh my God, you so have it bad for him.
What about Matt?
Matt who?
There's only one problem.
I haven't gotten a second alone with Nick.
He's been too busy bro-ing out downstairs with Jesus.
I'm gonna get a drink.
Look at you.
Everything okay?
Yeah, great.
Come on. Come on.
Oh, my God!
Um, sorry, you invited Sally Benton?
After she got R&J thrown off campus?
Brandon, we can't be petty.
I still have to work with her on honor board.
Plus, she's like, really popular.
If I didn't invite her, like,
none of the senior girls would've come.
There she is!
Hi!
Happy birthday!
Wow. Sally Benton's here.
Well, Monte sure does have a type, doesn't she?
Still think Sally initiated that kiss?
I... I don't know.
You having fun?
Yeah.
Where's Jude?
Um, upstairs, I think.
I don't know why he decided not to go to LA
so he could just sit in the corner by himself.
What?
Oh, I just... I might have an idea.
Uh, he got this picture from Connor.
What kind of picture?
Okay! Um, what, he told you about it?
No, I sort of accidentally intercepted it.
And I think it freaked him out a little.
'Cause he asked me where I learned to, you know, "Do it."
And what'd you say?
Porn.
What?
Ahem. Attention, skater boys.
If you're tired of playing with your half-pipe,
I suggest you make your way
up here for some real bumpin' and grindin'.
Oh, what?
Wait, that's all it takes?
You guys are weak, come on!
Yo, seriously, you remember when this was just a skate party
with like five dudes and some pizza?
Yeah, me neither.
Dude, it's Mariana's birthday, too.
And she's kind of my girlfriend. I can't just leave her hanging.
Fine.
Fine.
Hey, thanks, man.
Yeah.
Are you ready for some dancing?
Come on.
Uh-uh.
Mmm, cupcakes are delicious, Victor.
Thank you.
Mariana couldn't stop sampling
them when she worked with us at the bakery.
I bet.
She's a good girl.
You've done so well by her and Jesus.
Thank you, Victor.
But do you really think
helping Gabe get off this sex offender registry
is a good idea?
I'm sorry, who's helping Gabe?
Mariana.
Why aren't you dancing?
I don't really have anyone to dance with.
You can dance with me.
Shouldn't you be dancing with A.J.?
Um, I'm sort of avoiding him.
Why?
Um, I don't really think it's something you want to hear about.
How do you know?
Okay. Um...
I think he wants to have sex.
I told you.
No, it's okay.
Do you want to?
I'm not sure.
Are you like, nervous
that you won't know what to do?
Totally.
Yeah, I actually went online to look at...
pornography?
Yeah. You ever...
Yeah. Of course.
What'd you think?
Uh, I don't know.
What about you?
I mean, it kind of freaked me out.
It's so aggressive and impersonal.
You know, and of course they're acting.
They probably don't even know each other.
Sex isn't like that with someone you love and trust.
I mean, so I'm told.
Do you love A.J.?
Not like you love Connor.
But even if you do love someone,
you still don't have to do anything you're not ready for.
Then why can't you tell A.J. that?
Yup. No, you're right. I should.
Just tell him how I feel.
Did Jesus say anything to you?
No, when do I ever talk to Jesus?
20分钟以后在我家见
Hey, uh, so you know,
I think I'm gonna go home early, if that's okay.
Why? What's the matter?
Uh, I just... my stomach's not... it's feeling a little weird.
So, I might just go home.
Okay. Well, if you feel better,
we're doing presents later at home.
Okay. Yeah, uh, I'll rally.
Okay.
There you are.
I'm gonna go get some punch.
Am I being paranoid, or are you dodging me?
No, I just... my family's here.
I'm not that into PDA.
Well, we could always go someplace your family isn't.
Like where?
Like your house?
I can't just leave.
Why not?
Look, I'm gonna take a swing and say that Jesus won't mind,
and no offense, but you think Mariana's gonna even notice?
Okay. Let's go.
Tired of dancing?
Uh, no, just taking a break.
Yeah, actually, I should probably go soon.
Already?
Yeah. I have a paper due monday.
Leaving a party to go do homework.
Your parents expect a lot from you, huh?
They just want me to succeed.
But still, you must feel a lot of pressure
not to disappoint them.
I guess.
The thing is,
being who you think your parents want you to be
makes it kinda hard to be who you really are.
You have a right to be yourself, to be proud.
You don't need to feel ashamed.
You know, it occurred to me
that for you to have found Monte's dating profile
like your parents said,
you must have been registered on the site yourself.
And for her profile to come up,
you must have been searching as a woman looking for women.
Please, don't tell my mom.
Monte's career is at stake,
her reputation, Sally.
This lie could ruin her life.
Oh, um, I'll be right back.
Hey, we ever gonna dance through an entire song?
Sorry. Two seconds.
Hey, Ana.
So, how was it? How'd it go with Gabe?
Fine.
Fine?
Great.
Hey, hey, hey. This is silly, honey.
Come back and join the rest of us.
Why?
So Mariana can brag about her party being better?
No way.
Yeah, I knew she'd get what she wanted, like always.
Mariana may know how to get what she wants,
but she's got your back.
She does, seriously.
She's trying to help Gabe
get off the sex offender registry for you.
Why?
Well, I haven't asked her yet,
but I'm guessing it's because she thinks if he's off the list,
you guys can maybe get to know each other a little bit better.
Yeah, but he doesn't want anything to do with me.
You were- you were about eight when you asked me, um...
how many people someone was allowed to marry
because you wanted mama and me to marry a man.
And I said, "Well, sweetheart,
you're only allowed to marry one person."
And I asked you if you thought
maybe there was something that you needed from a dad
that maybe we could help make happen.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
I think it's hard to know
what you want from something
if you've never really had it.
But it's okay to be curious, Jesus, it is.
Gabe liked me until he knew I was his son.
That must... that must hurt.
You think...
you think if he got off that list he'd wanna know me?
I honestly don't know. But my main concern right now, my love,
is making sure that you have enough self-esteem
and enough love from mama and me
to handle this better than you have been.
Okay?
Come on. Let's go cut a rug.
That's old speak for "Dance."
Whatever you kids do these days.
Hey, you know I love having two moms, right?
We love having you, my sweet.
Baby, love.
What's wrong, honey?
Ana's here, and I think she's high or something.
Um, so how many of you are there, again?
Uh, well, I have two moms,
Callie, who they just adopted,
and her little brother jude.
They've lived with us for like, a year now.
And then there's the twins, Jesus and Mariana.
I think we adopted them when they were like six
and I was seven. But I mean,
it just feels like they've always been around.
Never realized how boring my life was until now.
What? Why?
You know, just, your family.
Your story. You.
It's all so amazing.
Well, you are anything but boring.
So, uh, how long till they get back?
Um, I don't know. Couple hours, maybe.
All right, so where should we...
Okay, FYI, we came home to be alone,
not to... you know. In case that's what you were thinking.
Wow. So that's what you think about me?
That I'm just some kind of slut?
No! No, I...
You wanna go upstairs?
Okay. But you better not take advantage of me.
What's going on?
You ruined everything! You ruined everything!
Calm down!
If you didn't send Gabe to prison,
we would have been a family.
We could have had a chance!
Please!
I wouldn't have lost the twins.
Keep it down.
You! You ruined his life and you ruined mine.
Ana, honey, you need to calm down.
Don't you tell me to calm down!
You took my babies.
Okay, Ana, you're out of control,
I have to ask you to leave.
No!
Please, just come home with us.
Let's go. Let's go!
I was going...
I will go!
I will go!
But I'm not going anywhere with you or you!
Okay. Okay.
Okay.
No, no, no, I will make sure that she gets home safely.
Are you sure that's a good idea?
I'm sure, love, okay?
I'll go with you.
Okay.
I don't understand. She was doing so well.
It's my fault.
I took her to see Gabe this afternoon and...
I left her alone.
He was drinking a beer. I'm such an idiot.
It's not your fault, mija.
It's Gabe's fault.
He's always been trouble.
This is just proof he doesn't
deserve our support to get off that registry.
I'm sorry.
Let's go.
What was that?
Is there someone home?
Let me check.
Wait, what if someone's trying to break in?
Don't worry, I'll protect you.
What the hell!
Oh my God, what are you doing?
I dropped a glass. Why aren't you at the party?
Why aren't you?
Uh, Cort, this is... this is Callie, my sister.
Nice to meet you.
Yeah.
We were just, uh, hanging out in the garage.
I just, uh...
That's okay. Um...
A.J., this is Cort, Brandon's girlfriend.
Sorry, I didn't realize anyone was home.
Yeah, no, I mean, me neither.
Well, uh, we're probably just gonna...
go back out...
to the...
So, you wanna go back upstairs?
Nah. I think I'm gonna go home.
You sure?
Are you sure?
About what?
About you and Brandon? Just now?
What was that? Why was that so weird, huh?
Why were you two acting like
you just got caught cheating on each other or something like that?
A.J., nothing is going on between me and Brandon, okay? Nothing.
Nothing doesn't feel like that, Callie.
So, that's her?
What?
Callie. She's the girl you loved
and couldn't be with for some reason.
Now I know why.
Look, um...
We really thought that
her adoption was never gonna happen.
And then it did.
And we didn't want to destroy the family,
so that was the end of us.
Like, truly, forever.
And no one can ever know.
I would never say anything.
And you know, if this is, like,
too weird for you, I get that.
It's not...
at all.
Actually, I think it's super mature.
Not the bored with high school parties kind of mature,
but the real kind.
You do?
A sacrifice like that? Definitely.
Also, it kind of turns out,
you're not the only one who lives with their ex.
Me and Mason are still in our old place with Eddie.
We don't... we don't share a bed or anything.
But that's why I've been picking up extra shifts,
to save up to get a place of my own.
You know, but it's just... it costs so much,
you know, with first and last and security.
But look, I get it if this is too weird for you.
You're amazing.
How did it go?
Uh, fine. Ana's home.
Passed out.
Okay. That's good, I guess.
Do you really think Gabe got her high?
I don't know, sweetheart.
Well, since we didn't get to do the cake,
why don't we do it now?
Okay. Let's...
What was that for?
Your birthday.
I thought you were mad at me?
I am. A little.
What?
Uh, there's someone outside.
Sorry. I was just leaving these.
Yeah. You wanna come in?
Nah, I should go.
Happy birthday.
Who was that?
That was my birth father.
How was the party?
It was okay.
How was homecoming?
Well, we won.
That's great.
I wish you'd been there.
Do you really?
Well, yeah, of course. I mean, I invited you.
Because you never come down to San Diego.
I have games on the weekends.
You didn't have to sign up for football and soccer and...
What... what are you... what's going on?
It's just so hard.
I mean, we barely ever talk.
We text all the time, Jude.
Texting is not a real conversation.
Is this about the picture I sent you?
No.
I mean, sort of.
I just didn't know why you sent it.
Are you trying to say you wanna have sex?
No, I...
I mean, I don't know.
You know, a lot of the guys on the team,
they send those pictures to their girlfriends,
and I thought you might like it.
It's not I didn't like it, it's just...
I didn't know what it meant.
You ever think that...
maybe the only reason why we got together
was because we were the only two gay boys in our grade?
Do you think that?
We were friends first.
I guess that's the problem.
You don't feel like my friend anymore.
Okay, well, what do you want to do?
Jude, do you want to break up?
Do you?
♪Happy birthday to you!♪
All right, Callie, why don't you help Brandon cut the cake?
And who wants some presents? Who's ready for some presents?
Yes! I am ready for some presents. Let's do this.
Hey, I'm sorry about earlier.
I didn't... I didn't realize...
No, it's okay.
She's pretty.
Who's this one from?
Gabe.
Look at this.
That's great.
Yeah, happy birthday, dork.
You too, weirdo.
Make way, make way! We're sorry, honey.
There's more where this came from.
Ooh, what's in this?
Sixteen. Where has the time gone?
Yo, B, is this from you?
