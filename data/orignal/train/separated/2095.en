Let's go. Let's go.
Keep moving.Keep moving.
Nobody gets through here.
Hey! Hey! Where is he?
Over there. Hey, you can't go out there
without a blast suit!
Chin! Chin!
Guys, what are you doing?
Don't move. Don't move.
You need to be in suits.
You're not wearing one, neither are we.
Chin, we're gonna get you out of this thing, okay?
He got the drop on me.
Never should have happened.
This isn't your fault, okay?
Just don't move.
This bomb has a mercury motion sensor.
If you move, it'll activate.
Listen, just tell us what you saw.
I didn't see anything.
I got hit from behind.
I blacked out.
I woke up here with that hood over my head.
There's something else you should know.
What?
He said he would contact you with instructions.
And if you didn't comply...
I'd be dead.
Oh, look at this. Santa Claus.
Mele kalikimaka.
No, no, no, no, not, uh, not here. Remember?
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Your house, your king's English.
Good morning, sir,
and Merry Christmas.
I have acquired your request.
Yeah? Nice one, eh?
No, no, no, not nice. What is this?
Is this a tent?
What you mean?
This is clearly not gonna work for me.
You see?
You could alter it.
You could alter it to what?
You gonna put pockets on it and make it a pool table?
This isn't gonna work, buddy. Come on.
You told me your cousin could get me a suit.
Call me crazy, I thought that when he said he could do it,
it would be in my size range.
This wouldn't even fit you.
You could always order it online.
No, no, no, I can't order anything online because
I ordered that tree online and look what I got.
Look at it.
Ooh, that's what that is.
Listen to me.
This seems silly, but it's very important to me.
I dress up as Santa Claus every year
for my daughter Grace.
I need a suit that fits,
And this... this is ridiculous.
Daniel, if you do this every year,
Why don't you own a Santa suit?
I did. It looked very nice on me.
It was a svelte suit. It fit me, okay?
But I lost it in the divorce.
Ah, bummahs!
I still think it's good.
For you maybe.
Yeah, hello.
Okay, I'm here. Pick me up on the way.
Chin, what do you got?
Couple of guys out night surfing came across a floater.
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait.
That's Luther Magallanes.
What, you know him?
I figured you would.
Yeah, he's a major arms dealer.
He was one of the go-to guys for Al Qaeda in Iraq,
But after The Surge, he went dark.
Interpol's been looking for him ever since.
Well, they can scratch him off their list.
M.E. said cause of death was two gunshot wounds
to the back of the cranium.
Execution style.
Yeah, but there were several anomalies.
Anomalies?
Yeah. That's what Max called them.
You know how he likes the big words.
According to him, the victim was dead about two days
before his body was discovered in the ocean.
It's a classic body dump. Nothing anomalous about it.
Max also found chlorine in his lungs,
and heavy bruising around his neck.
So did they dunk him in the pool
before they popped him twice in the head?
Shooter might have tortured him for information first.
Wait a minute. Just hang on a sec.
What? Luther Magallanes is high-profile.
I mean, this guy's got serious backing,
which means whoever eliminated him doesn't care about payback.
All right.
so whoever killed him either has a bigger operation going on,
or he is just one fearless, fearless son of a bitch.
The fearless ones, huh?
They're the ones with nothing to lose.
Great. We need more bullets.
Excellent.
Gentlemen, I think I found our primary crime scene.
This is where Magallanes's body was recovered.
Now, if we take into account time of death
and try to pinpoint the exact location
where the body went into the water
using tide pull and speed of current...
The body must have gone in somewhere in this vicinity.
What is that place?
The Ikalani Resort. 642-acre real estate wonder.
Very high-end, very secluded.
They own that whole stretch of beach.
Private villas, secluded pools,
Easy access to cliffs where you could dump a body.
Especially with two bullets in it.
I contacted the Ikalani.
It turns out that Luther Magallanes
owns a private villa there.
I had them pull their security footage
right around our estimated time of death.
And it just arrived.
There's our boy.
Luther Magallanes.
Who's that with him?
Stop the tape. Stop the tape, Kino.
Push in.
That's Victor Hesse.
Whatever these people want, Steve,
Don't give it to them.
Dad, I'm going to get you out of there. All right?
Don't you give it to them!
No more games!
Dad? Dad?
No!
Steve Mcgarrett here. Get me the governor.
I don't care what she's doing. Pull her out of the meeting.
Tell her the man that killed my father is still alive.
Thanks.
Lab techs found some fresh prints.
It's confirmed.
Hesse was here.
I'm sorry, Steve.
How is Victor Hesse even alive?
I mean, I put two shots straight through the guy's chest.
The guy's a cockroach. It's what they do.
They come back from the dead.
Next time you step on him, don't take your foot off.
All right.
If Hesse is still on the island,
we can assume he's not getting off, right?
He's on everybody's watch list.
Plus we've got his only known associate,
Sang min, behind bars.
That's good.
Which brings us to Luther Magallanes.
Now, I was thinking, since both he and Hesse
were involved in illegal arms,
either they were working on a deal together,
or Hesse is eliminating his competition
to reestablish himself back in the business.
What's that?
Uh, HPD found a cell phone in a tide pool off the cliffs.
Could have dropped out
of Luther's pocket when hesse tossed him.
Might give you some answers.
I'll get on it.
Little early for lunch there, isn't it, cuz?
Magallanes's cell phone
was in a tide pool for the last two days.
Saltwater fried the circuitry,
but the SIM card is still intact.
So the rice.
Yeah.
Pulls the moisture off the SIM card.
Okay.
Let's see what we got.
Looks like we've got Luther's call history.
Nice work.
Chin, what do you got?
Trent Agustin,
local kine gun dealer.
Luther called him twice on the day he was killed.
If they're in business together,
I figure Trent might know where we can find Hesse.
Where is he?
You see those guys, right?
They'll move.
No, they don't look like they're moving.
They'll move.
Hey!
Told you.
This is a chicken fight?
Are you kidding me?
Every place has got its black eye.
I mean, Jersey's got tanning salons. We got this.
Okay. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
Everybody. You, birdman, stop.
Please. Okay?
Now, although I do not agree with nor do I see the fun
in watching my dinner
brawl it out in a steel cage match,
That is not what we're doing here.
We're not here to arrest you.
We're just looking for Trent Agustin.
So please, Trent, step forward.
Or nobody says anything,
and everybody goes to jail.
Okay, birdman, put the bird down. Come on.
That's not necessary.
I'm Trent Agustin.
All right, everybody. Put the birds back
where the birds go, and clear this place out.
You're done here today. You, come on.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
You think Hesse did this?
Okay, look, we're not here to discuss the finer points
of detective work with you.
Just need you to answer our questions. That's all.
We were involved in a few transactions with Hesse.
He trusted us.
He came to us when he was injured.
When he was injured?
Let me guess-- he had a couple holes in him?
He was in bad shape.
We referred him to a doctor
who specializes in this kind of clientele.
What's the doctor's name?
Dr. Frank Galey, general practice.
Office in Kahala, home in st. Louis heights.
Divorced, lives alone.
Criminal record?
Not even a speeding ticket.
Hey, just got off the phone
with Galey's office and one of his neighbors.
Uh, no one's seen the good doctor for months.
And no one filed a missing persons?
Apparently not.
Galey sent out an e-mail to friends,
family and colleagues about eight weeks ago
that he was taking a much needed,
well-earned trip around the world.
Well, I'm sure he won't mind us looking around his house.
Danny, Chin, take the back.
Kono, you're on me.
Dr. Galey, Five-O. Open up.
Clear.
Clear.
Clear.
Clear.
Let's check the garage.
Bullets yours?
Nine millimeters.
You put two of those in Hesse and didn't kill him?
Next time, shoot him in the face.
Uh, boss?
Dr. Galey.
Guess he won't be making house calls anymore.
They got a nicer tree than I do.
Your tree is fine.
No, my tree is not fine.
It's small. It's depressing. It's pathetic, okay?
No, it's just like your apartment. It's perfect.
You know what's perfect?
Perfect is that I get Grace for six hours on Christmas day.
Okay? Six hours, just her and I alone
in my apartment, okay?
If I was back home, we'd be at my mother's house.
I mean, forget about the food that she would cook,
but I would have a big tree-- a huge, lovely tree--
and Grace would be surrounded by people that love her.
Listen to me, all right?
I know something about being raised by a single father.
All Grace is going to remember
is that she spent her christmas with Dad.
Okay? That's what's perfect.
So just relax with the tree.
Here's Sang Min.
Back so soon?
Well, what can I say? I missed your smile.
Let me guess. You need my help.
We found out Victor Hesse is still alive.
You're not a very good shot, are you?
Listen to me.
Victor Hesse has been living here
off the grid for the last four months.
All right? We know your business
is keeping people under the radar,
so we thought you could help us find him.
You thought wrong.
Just tell us where he is.
Detective, I already helped you once, huh?
And it's in your best interest to help us again.
How do you figure?
Listen to me.
I'm going to find Victor Hesse with our without you,
and if I find him without you, I'm going to tell him
that you're the one who led me to him six months ago.
How do you think he's going to feel about that?
More to the point, how long you think you're going to last
in here when everybody finds out you're a rat?
Take your time.
Kishimoto.
Kishimoto? What?
Who's Kishimoto?
He's a facilitator
for the Japanese underground in Honolulu.
He's a facilitator? What does that mean?
He's the man to see if your visa expires
and you don't want to go home.
He sets you up with papers,
real estate, cars, whatever you need.
Okay, if this guy, Kishimoto, is so connected,
How do we know that he hasn't
already helped Hesse off the island?
Because that's not what he does.
That's what I do, huh?
Just get us a meeting with Kishimoto, okay?
No way you'll get in there unless I'm there.
Look at this guy. What are you doing,
angling for another field trip?
Whatever you got to do.
But you need me.
How badly do you want to find Victor Hesse?
Check you out.
You're like the Asian John Travolta.
Got one more piece of jewelry for you, babe.
Now you're perfect.
I've driven by this place 10,000 times.
I never knew it was a private club.
Why would you? You can't afford it.
Sang Min.
I didn't hear about your early release.
'Cause I haven't been released.
These gentlemen wanted to meet you.
Steve mcgarrett, Danny Williams, Five-o.
Now, why would you bring law enforcement into my club?
They're not here for you, Kishimoto.
They're here about Victor Hesse.
Okay? They're cool.
I'll have my men escort you out.
You can have your men escort me out in a minute.
Just want to show you a couple photos.
These are the only two people
besides you who have helped Victor Hesse since he's been on the run.
He did this?
What can I say?
Victor Hesse doesn't like loose ends.
Look, you could, uh...
you could be the subject of the next photo
that we go to show the next people we go to question,
or you could just tell us right now
where Victor Hesse is and make it easy on everybody.
I set him up in a condo
in Ala Moana on Frank Street.
He's been living there for a few weeks.
Okay. Where does he hang out?
There's a private hostess bar on Nuuanu.
Bedroom is Clear.
Clear.
Bathroom's clear!
Hey. Hesse isn't here.
Just hold your position.
We're at the second location now.
Roger that.
Easy.
Next time, watch the hair, huh?
"Watch the hair, huh?"
Do yourself a favor.
You watch the hair, huh? Maybe you'll learn something.
I thought we had a bond of trust.
Sit tight, pal. Enjoy to see me.
So let me get this hostess bar thing straight.
You're not allowed to touch any of these girls?
I mean, these guys are buying them drinks
all night for what?
To talk to them.
Why would anybody wanna talk to them?
I'm serious. I'm just asking.
Danny, please, can we just focus?
Danny!
All right. At least he's still got the anklet on.
Make your next right.
They're way ahead of us. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Seat belt. Seat belt.
Good idea.
Okay. All right. Yeah.
Do that after I put the seat belt on, all right?
Oh! Come on, man.
All right. They're, uh, stopping at Ala Moana harbor.
Chin's two blocks from there. Call him.
Chin.
I'm on my way.
I'm here. Where is he?
All right, he is at the end of the dock on a boat.
Slip 71.
Okay, he stopped moving. He's inside.
Got it.
Chin!
Chin!
Guys, what are you doing?
Don't move. Don't move.
You need to be in suits.
You're not wearing one, neither are we.
Hey, listen, just tell us what you saw.
I didn't see anything.
I got hit from behind. I blacked out.
I woke up here with that hood over my head.
Victor.
Do you realize that the last time
we spoke like this, I killed your father.
Yeah, and I killed your brother; Score's been settled.
Would be if I believed in the law of retaliation.
Eye for an eye is just not my style, Steve.
So why don't you tell me what you want.
Pretty simple really.
I'm holding the detonator to the bomb attached to your man.
I want $10 million and safe passage off the island
or he dies.
I'm gonna find you.
Victor, I'm gonna find you,
and this time, you're not gonna walk away, you understand?
Call you in an hour. Steve.
Public's been evacuated.
My men set up a two-block perimeter around the palace.
All right, make it three.
Hesse's used this type of bomb before in Belfast, 2002.
Blew the head off a local politician
and he took out a dozen bystanders
who thought they were safe behind the barricades.
What do my men need to know about this thing?
It's made of biometric armor
with a mercury motion sensor,
which means if we try to move chin,
the bomb will detonate;
if we try to cut it off,
the bomb will detonate.
How is Hesse controlling it?
With a remote detonator which requires his thumbprint to work.
So, how do we defuse it?
We cannot defuse it, unless we meet Hesse's demands.
Spoke to the governor.
What, she's not gonna give us the money?
"We don't negotiate with terrorists, Daniel."
Her words.
What are we gonna tell our boy?
I guess we're gonna tell him the truth.
Howzit, fellas? What's new?
What's the word, boss?
The ransom money fell through.
Well, I'm not surprised.
But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed.
You just need to sit tight, okay?
We're gonna get that thing off you, I promise.
I don't have much choice, brah.
Kono, be careful.
Don't touch him, Kono.
Oh, my god. Are you okay?
What are we doing to get this off of him?
Hesse is demanding $10 million,
and the governor will not play ball.
So we need $10 million?
Yes.
I'm sorry, what's the look here?
You know where to get $10 million?
No, but Chin Ho does.
Kono, don't.
It's the only way to save your life...
What did you do, you won, uh, you won the lottery
and you didn't tell us about it?
She's talking about the asset forfeiture locker.
At HPD?
They got jewels and stolen cars.
They don't got that kind of money there.
It's not that one, it's another one.
Most cops don't know about it.
It's where they keep the confiscated
drugs and money while suspects await trial,
but this one's only for the big scores.
And they got $10 million in there?
They got $28,567,000 in cash, to be exact.
It's all from one big drug haul eight years ago.
When the investigation went cold,
all that money just sat there.
Three years ago, $200,000 of it went missing,
and everyone started looking at me.
Why? Why'd they look at you?
Because it was my case.
This is the one I couldn't drop.
Someone framed him to end the investigation.
First...
they accused him of taking payoffs,
then stealing from the locker.
Okay.
Where is it?
Think about what you're asking right now.
All right,Can we just... Where is it?
Chin, please, this is your life.
It's underneath HPD headquarters in district 1.
But no matter what you guys are thinking about doing,
it's not worth it.
Hesse is gonna kill me whether he gets that $10 million or not.
You know that's true.
Okay, yes, yes... I'm sure that is his plan.
But with this money, I can get a face-to-face with him,
And this is the only shot we got.
Chin,
you got to tell me how to get into that locker.
Everything you need to know
is on a set of blueprints at my house.
Where in your house?
My bedroom, underneath the nightstand.
Move it, and there's a loose floorboard.
All right.
Don't move him.
Hey. You want to talk about what just happened or no?
That's for later. We got work to do.
That's for later? Ho, ho, ho, all right?
For me, I just want to know, are we really gonna go
break into a police safe and steal drug money?
I know what you're gonna say, all right? We're cops.
We don't steal. There's got to be another way to do this.
There's not another way to do this, Danny. Look around. Okay?
And by the way, I'm not a cop, I'm a SEAL.
Okay. Would you relax? You're getting me wrong.
Okay? Superman, bring it down.
Just a notch, all right?
Our boy's in trouble; we do what we got to do.
I understand that. I'm just trying to measure
the level of insanity we're dealing with,
That's all.
High.Very high.
Clearly. Clearly.
All right?
Yes.
Yeah.
Have you chosen a spot to watch the fireworks from?
Listen, I can get the money, all right?
I'm sure your friend will be happy to hear about that.
I need four hours.
You've got three.
I'll be in touch with further instructions then.
I got the blueprints.
Look, I know what you're thinking,
But my cousin never took a dime of that money.
These blueprints are a little suspect, no?
After Chin was framed, he lost his badge.
He said he kept them to protect someone.
I don't know who, but I believe him.
And now that you know, so should you.
All right, listen.
How are we gonna steal this money?
Borrow.
Borrow.
Okay, we're gonna borrow $10 million;
we're gonna capture Hesse during the drop-off,
then I'm gonna return the money before anyone knows it's missing.
Okay, good. Uh, just a question.
Does this super-secret room have a super-secret entrance?
Yes. It's accessible two ways.
The first is through HPD.
HPD! Beautiful! A room full of armed people
who definitely do not want to help us out, right?
The second one is through here.
A tunnel.
A tunnel? Why is there a tunnel?
It was built by the army in World War II
to get supplies across the island.
Chin Ho said that after he was accused,
the tunnel may have been sealed.
We'll unseal it.
Hello?
May I ask what you're doing in front of my condo?
Oh, nothing, auntie, we're just,
you know, doing some water stuff.
Water stuff?
Yeah. We'll be done soon, I promise.
We have a neighborhood watch here.
That is... so nice.
Why doesn't your truck have a city and county sign on it?
You don't seem to work very hard around here.
I'll call the city and check you out.
Perfect timing.
You got it?
Yeah.
How are you doing, cuz?
Hey. I'm glad you're okay.
I was afraid you were gonna go and do something stupid.
it's not me. Boss man.
We're gonna go make the drop.
Be careful, Kono.
Yeah.
I cannot be the reason you get hurt.
Besides, your mom would kill me.
We're both gonna walk away from this.
You hear me?
Kono.
Aloha.
Aloha.
Yeah?
Have you got my money?
I do. Why don't you come down to Iolani Palace,
We'll do the exchange there.
How about I turn your man into puzzle pieces?
Wait, wait!
There's a field across Farrington in Waipahu.
There's a lot of fields in Waipahu.
Oh, you'll see me. I'll make sure of it.
Oh, and come alone.
Or your man goes boom.
Did you get that?
Oh, yeah.
Kono. We're here.
That's enough.
Where's Sang Min?
Enjoying his freedom.
He said to say "thanks," by the way.
I'll find him.
You're a confident fellow, Steve.
I like that.
In fact, I was counting on that.
Did you bring the money?
Yeah, I brought the money.
Deactivate the bomb.
Let me see the money first.
No! No! Hesse!
The money for Chin Ho's life.
That was the deal.
This was never about the money, Steve.
This is about honor.
It's about unfinished business.
This is about looking into your eyes
when I kill a man who serves under you,
a man that you are responsible for.
You told me you didn't care about getting even.
I lied.
Now!
Chin, it's over. We are clear.
What did the Governor say?
She's kind of pissed about Sang Min.
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.
I just told her that it's one of those
glass-half-full kinds of moments.
You know? I mean, yes, Sang Min is on the lam,
but Victor Hesse is locked up,
and he's not gonna see the outside
of Halawa Correctional in this lifetime, so...
What about the money?
I didn't tell her.
Huh? What was that?
I didn't tell her.
Good. So, you-you do have ten million
stashed away somewhere to pay that cash back, right?
Danny, that money's been on ice for over eight years.
Okay, nobody's going to notice that it's missing.
So, what if this cold case turns into a hot case again,
and someone wants to go in there and count that cash?
What do you think is going to happen to you?
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.
I know the answer. You go to jail.
I'm not gonna go to jail, okay?
Okay, maybe I got to jail.
Yeah, maybe.
Right now, Chin Ho is alive, okay?
Why can't we just celebrate that win?
We'll figure the rest out tomorrow.
You just better start buying some lottery tickets.
That's all I'm saying.
And you better start prepping that sleigh, Tubsy, okay?
It's almost Christmas Eve.
I'll drive.
Can I ask you a question?
Why are you always driving my car?
I like to drive.
No, no, no. Rainman likes to drive.
You have control issues.
You learn to sew in the SEALS?
I learned to sew in the Boy Scouts.
Why am I not surprised?
Why is it a big deal I can sew?
I see a limo.
Guys, she's here.
Come on.
Hey, Grace.
Hi!
Mele kalikimaka!
"Merry christmas," please.
Who's that?
Did you hear that?
Ho. Santa!
Oh! Yes, it is Santa.
Merry christmas.
Looks like you lost some weight.
Just a little bit. Come here.
What did you get me? Any presents?
Wo Fat,
what are you doing here?
I have a question for you,
one I needed to ask in person.
What is it?
How much does Steve Mcgarrett know
about what his father was investigating
before you killed him?
How close is he to the truth?
Too close.
