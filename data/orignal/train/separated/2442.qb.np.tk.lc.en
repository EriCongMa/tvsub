i want you to compel me to forget that
i ever loved him .
who is damon salvatore ?
he was a monster .
where the hell are we ?
1994 .
we &apos;re never getting out .
there &apos;s someone else here .
to get home , we &apos;ll harness the power of the eclipse
using a mystical relic .
it &apos;s called an ascendant .
forgetting someone ?
i &apos;m back .
i know what alaric is .
i know what you are .
you &apos;re a witch .
wait . you &apos;re from mystic falls ?
born and raised .
one of the founding families actually .
stefan could &apos;ve told me there was a hunter in town .
i want my memories back .
wait . what ?
i want alaric to uncompel me .
alaric !
i &apos;m not supposed to be alive .
alaric is not a vampire anymore , elena .
he &apos;s human .
there &apos;s a girl you need to go see .
ok . i &apos;ll start .
i know alaric &quot; eternal sunshined &quot; our relationship out of your brain ,
but please , please tell me it &apos;s coming back
or at least part of it
because imagining this exact moment
is what got me through the last few months .
i &apos;m not sure what to say .
easy , so easy . just say
that you missed me as much as i missed you .
i remember ... pain .
i remember all the terrible things that you did
to the people that i care about .
i honestly don &apos;t remember anything good between us .
i thought if i saw you in person
it might change everything , but ...
maybe you just need a little more time .
damon , i know that i loved you .
yeah .
and i know that apparently i forgave you
for all of the awful things that you did .
yeah .
but i just don &apos;t remember it .
i &apos;m sorry . i ...
i just don &apos;t ...
feel it anymore .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah .
i &apos;m , uh--ahem .
yeah .
damon , i-- i really am sorry .
i really don &apos;t think you should be playing with all that stuff .
keep going . we are on a roll .
all the terrible things i did to people that elena cared about .
let &apos;s see . i turned caroline into my own personal blood juice box ,
i turned matt &apos;s sister into a vampire
and threatened to kill bon @-@ bon a couple times .
more than a couple .
subjective . sometimes , i was being funny .
and you killed stefan &apos;s best friend
at his birthday party .
unfortunate coincidence .
and then you snapped jeremy &apos;s neck
when elena said she &apos;d never love you .
on second thought , let &apos;s focus on all the charming , heroic things
you obliterated from my girl &apos;s mind .
god , if i could take it all back , i would .
i know .
and listen .
despite the fact that my long list of dastardly deeds
involves killing you ,
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re alive .
thanks , man .
yeah .
although had you actually died a vampire
instead of becoming human again ,
your compulsion would have gone away ,
and elena would be mine again .
really heartfelt . appreciate it .
now she &apos;s stuck with only evil me memories forever and ever .
if you kill me , i am dead for good this time .
you remember that .
good morning .
i don &apos;t know if this is a good time .
just a heads @-@ up , doc .
you &apos;re gonna be in real high demand
with a bunch of vampires who want to be human again
if you could repeat that little healing trick
that you did at the border with ric last night .
well , just a heads @-@ up ,
but saving alaric &apos;s life was a matter of a treatable death wound ,
perfect timing , and fear of losing
the most interesting guy i &apos;ve dated
in a while adrenaline .
100 % unrepeatable , which is why you will tell no one .
she &apos;s bossy .
i like her .
do you have a nice suit and a clean pair of socks ?
uh , yeah , i think so .
good . i &apos;m releasing you .
hospital fundraiser &apos;s tonight .
i &apos;m making the interns go , so i need a date .
start your paperwork .
hello again . that was quite a mess you made at the border last night .
hit @-@ and @-@ run .
good thing matt here was in the neighborhood to give you a ride home .
you brought me here ?
you went after my friends . what &apos;d you expect ?
your friends who kill people .
come on , enzo . ask him what you want to know .
let &apos;s get this over with .
stefan has already made a very passionate argument
in favor of snapping your neck ,
whereas in a surprising role reversal ,
i &apos;ve opted for the let &apos;s think this through ,
get all the information before we kill him method .
don &apos;t be a dick .
you know , you can dry the vervain out of him ,
compel him to forget everything ,
and he &apos;ll never set foot in mystic falls again .
you don &apos;t really think
he &apos;s a one @-@ man vampire busting operation , do you ?
look . while tripp tortured me for the names of your friends ,
i had a front @-@ row seat to quite a few urgent phone calls
and visits from mysterious right @-@ hand men ,
many of whom were wearing uniforms
not dissimilar to the one you &apos;ve been traipsing around in .
i &apos;d just like to know what they &apos;re up to while he &apos;s here with us .
they &apos;re doing the same thing they were when they were with me .
they &apos;re tracking vampires like your friend caroline forbes .
take two hours ,
get the names of his men and what they know .
after that , he &apos;s a liability .
get rid of him .
you didn &apos;t feel anything ?
i felt scared and guilty ,
and his eyes were really , really blue and pretty ,
but ... no .
i don &apos;t remember loving him .
so you don &apos;t remember . so be it .
that &apos;s your advice ?
elena , look at your life right now .
you &apos;re doing well in school ,
you &apos;re following your dreams ,
you met liam , who also has very pretty eyes ,
not mention he &apos;s never killed your brother .
true .
i mean , i just gave stefan the friend boot .
maybe a little break from the salvatore brothers
is in the cards for the both of us .
look . mcdreamy &apos;s coming .
i got to go .
see you later .
bye .
so guess who came into the hospital
for a shoulder arthroscopy this morning .
hello to you , too .
lady whitmore , the girl from the bonfire ,
the one you miraculously saved from certain death
and i can &apos;t figure out how .
turns out she was here on a tennis scholarship
before she blew out her arm last year .
now she needs to get her cartilage cleaned out every 6 months .
you &apos;re still obsessing over that .
but here &apos;s the crazy part .
she doesn &apos;t remember getting hurt in the corn maze crash .
she must have been really drunk .
i &apos;m gonna take a look at her labs ,
see if she &apos;s not an alien or a super soldier or something .
when do volunteers have access to the patient labs ?
since never , but if you rat me out ,
you can &apos;t be my date to the hospital fundraiser tonight .
yeah ? well , we have to go .
jo said that it &apos;s mandatory .
doesn &apos;t mean it can &apos;t still be a date .
look who &apos;s awake .
how do you feel ?
like you shot me with an arrow .
right . anyhoo , i have no idea
how you managed to shatter the ascendant into a billion pieces ,
but we need to put it together
before the eclipse at 12 : 28 .
you want to help ?
i know you &apos;re a puzzle person .
i don &apos;t want to help .
you &apos;re a psychopath .
this place is your prison .
i &apos;m not letting you out .
besides , you &apos;ll just kill me the minute we get out .
you &apos;ve been through a trauma .
your memory &apos;s probably a little fuzzy right now ,
so you might be thinking that your magic will protect you ,
but all i have to do is hold your hand ,
and your magic suddenly becomes mine .
what was that ? huh ? what ?
you &apos;re gonna do the spell and finally get us home ?
that &apos;s weird .
what &apos;s weird ?
none of your business .
we &apos;re not friends anymore ,
which means you can &apos;t just show up unannounced at my door . good @-@ bye .
caroline .
look . you &apos;re not safe .
tripp &apos;s men still have your name .
so , what ? you here to protect me ?
news flash ! i don &apos;t need your protection ,
and more importantly , i don &apos;t want it .
hey , mom . can i call you back ?
i &apos;m trying to get a piece of gum off of my shoe .
actually , honey , this can &apos;t wait .
do you have any idea where tripp cook might be ?
tripp ? no . i have no idea . why ?
because one of his men just ran me off the road ,
and they &apos;re gonna kill me if they don &apos;t get him back .
answer your phone , enzo !
i just--i didn &apos;t call her today , you know ?
i always call my mom every saturday morning ,
but , no , today ,
i said , &quot; screw it . i want to sleep in .
i &apos;ll do it tomorrow . &quot;
well , don &apos;t worry . we &apos;re almost there .
we &apos;re almost there ?
you said , two hours and then kill him . &quot;
do you even remember how long ago you said that ?
i mean , what kind of person sets a ticking clock
without setting his watch ?
tell me that tripp is still alive .
tripp is still alive ,
surprisingly torture @-@ resistant but alive .
what took you so long to answer your phone ?
my fingers were covered in blood ,
and the touchscreen wouldn &apos;t work .
just don &apos;t kill him , ok ?
one of his guys took my mom ,
so just keep your hands off of him
so i can get her back , ok ?
enzo , please .
i thought i could make the world a better place
by getting rid of them ,
teach kids like you to be strong , defend yourselves ,
but look at you .
you &apos;re on the wrong side .
i &apos;m not on the wrong side , man .
my side &apos;s just really freaking complicated .
update .
tripp &apos;s henchmen kidnapped the sheriff of mystic falls .
what ?
it &apos;s a contingency plan in case anything ever happened to me .
that &apos;s your idea of being on the right side ?
you can set the meet for the edge of town of old miller road .
you can do the trade there .
they know they &apos;ll be safe behind the border .
and send matt .
they trust him .
antibiotics .
painkillers .
an hour and 43 minutes .
i can do this .
seriously ?
you don &apos;t know how to fill a champagne glass ?
i never said i was a professional .
first and most obvious rule ,
they all have to be even
and no slopping over the sides .
thank you .
for what , not firing you ?
i &apos;m not even paying you .
for letting me try to repay you .
i killed someone
so that you wouldn &apos;t trigger your werewolf curse ,
and you think that being my bar back for a night
is enough to repay me ?
honestly , i &apos;d rather chain myself up in a cellar
and turn every month than have to wear this lame @-@ ass tie .
which isn &apos;t straight .
you should take some pride in your appearance .
so what are you , the guest of honor or something ?
i won an award for a battlefield medical clamp i patented .
whitmore likes to trot me out when they want to raise money .
so basically , you &apos;re a genius .
or she has a witchy advantage .
what , supposed to be a secret that she &apos;s a witch ?
i don &apos;t practice , so no witchy advantage ,
just a lot of hard work .
who invited him ?
he sort of invited himself ,
mostly to stalk elena .
don &apos;t be cynical .
i &apos;m here to spend some quality time
with my once dead , now human best bud .
who &apos;s that ?
that would be liam davis ,
valedictorian , straight a &apos;s freshman year
taking junior @-@ level classes ,
not to mention medical royalty .
not so bad on the eyes either .
looks like he &apos;s elena &apos;s date .
did i say i liked you ?
i meant the opposite .
you know those things are rigged , right ?
is that another one of your conspiracy theories ?
super soldiers take over the world
to carry out vicious fundraising schemes ?
well , when you say it like that , i sound like a loser .
when i win my trip to fiji ,
you don &apos;t have to come .
ok . maybe you can come .
can you grab us a couple drinks ?
sure .
sorry . i didn &apos;t know that you were here .
hey . wine or beer ?
you know , um , it doesn &apos;t matter ,
whatever you want .
hi . damon salvatore , elena &apos;s ex .
nice to meet you ...
liam .
liam .
wait . damon ?
damon .
as in the ex who died ?
right . yeah , um , that is what i--
what i told you .
obviously , that &apos;s not true .
it &apos;s a figure of speech . it &apos;s more kind of an emotional death .
you know , it was a very messy breakup ,
but we &apos;re past that now , right ?
we &apos;re--we &apos;re in the friend stage .
right .
yeah .
yeah .
so the ex meets the new guy .
how freaked out are you right now ?
i feel a little threatened ,
but i think i could take you .
confident . pfft . sexy .
damon .
i &apos;m sorry . what &apos;s going on ?
focus . go the bar , get her a chardonnay .
i hate chardonnay .
i know .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;ll explain on the dance floor .
may i ?
hello , gorgeous .
what did you do to him ?
oh , he &apos;s fine .
just a little blood loss .
i think he may have an iron deficiency problem .
knock it off . her mother &apos;s life is on the line .
hang on . just so i &apos;m clear .
all caroline had to do to get you to treat her
with a modicum of respect is to stop paying attention to you .
is that how his works ?
shut up , enzo .
and did he really need 3 chains ?
i mean , who is this guy , the hulk ?
well , i didn &apos;t restrain him .
no , but you let your sidekick enzo do it
because what could go wrong when you team up with your sworn enemy ?
oh . that &apos;s brilliant .
of course that &apos;s why she hates you .
that &apos;s how you worked her into such a state in savannah .
that &apos;s why she told you to go take a leap .
she hates you because she doesn &apos;t hate you at all .
i &apos;m sorry . are you still talking ?
she got a thing for you , mate .
tell your mom i send my best .
whatever he just said , it will never be discussed again , ok ?
why are you doing this ?
why ? well , because i &apos;m an incredible dancer ,
and it would be a shame not to share my talent
with the world .
oh . don &apos;t worry . i didn &apos;t see you smile .
miss mystic falls .
first time we ever danced .
stefan stood you up--
bloodlust issues , surprise , surprise--
so i stepped in .
you &apos;re trying to stir up memories .
this isn &apos;t a good idea .
i stepped in , sexy as hell ,
and saved you from complete and utter humiliation .
of course , you were just worried about stefan ,
but there was this moment , this one moment ,
where everyone else fell away ,
and it was just the two of us .
look . i &apos;m here with someone , damon .
you can &apos;t just come unannounced
and ruin my night .
come unannounced ? what are you talking about ?
i literally went through time and space
to be with you .
i know , but look .
do you want me to feel guilty ?
because trust me , damon . i do , ok ?
i feel horrible , and i &apos;m sorry ,
but i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t know what to tell you .
what do you want me to say ?
i don &apos;t remember us .
i do , and no matter how much i missed you
or how much pain i was in ,
i never would have erased everything we ever had .
even if i was drowning in grief ,
i &apos;d rather hang on to every moment that i ever held you
or every laugh that i ever heard ,
every shred of happiness that we ever had .
i would rather spend every moment in agony
than erase the memory of you .
i need some air .
so that seems to be going well .
yeah . that &apos;s my fault .
i shouldn &apos;t have compelled her .
you shouldn &apos;t mix painkillers and booze .
whatever you did for elena , that &apos;s her choice .
remember that . no pun intended .
i am not on painkillers .
in fact , i feel awful , but i am enjoying
every miserable human moment of pain .
to being powerless and mundane .
cheers .
so i guess we are both formerly supernatural beings .
should we start a support group ?
well , technically , i relinquished my magic
and put it away for safekeeping .
i didn &apos;t know you could do that .
let &apos;s just say i chose to remove myself
from a tragically dysfunctional family ,
and i haven &apos;t regretted a moment of it .
hey . who let you in ?
oh . a radiologist i met at the gym .
so what &apos;s the story with tyler ?
it &apos;s a short story called
&quot; mind your own business . &quot;
liv , i &apos;m not saying don &apos;t have fun , ok ,
because that &apos;s why we &apos;re here ,
but when the coven calls us home ,
they don &apos;t care if we &apos;re in love or not .
you sound like dad ,
and that &apos;s not a compliment .
liv .
have fun with your gym fling .
leave me to mine .
yes . ok .
where &apos;s the last piece ?
where is it ?
this isn &apos;t happening .
looking for this ?
you stole the ascendant , naughty girl .
you weren &apos;t planning on using it and leaving me behind , were you ?
you left a trail of blood in the driveway .
figured where else would you stop and play nurse ?
vados !
get off me !
i thought about taking the keys ,
but that &apos;d be like taking the cheese out of a mousetrap ,
right , bonnie ?
although , you know , fun fact .
mice don &apos;t actually like cheese .
isn &apos;t that great ?
so we have an hour until the eclipse .
it &apos;s time to go home , bonnie .
i want to remember .
well , you &apos;re a day late and a dollar short , huh ?
i mean , i want to try .
knowing that there &apos;s this whole piece of my life missing ,
it &apos;s , it &apos;s driving me crazy , ok ?
so i have to at least try to get it back .
yeah .
how are you supposed to do that ?
i know there &apos;s nothing we can do about the compulsion ,
but maybe if we unwind the memories backwards ,
something might trigger something ,
and maybe they &apos;ll all come back , right ?
yeah . sure . tell me what you want me to do .
take me to the last place i told you i loved you .
i brought you a present .
ta @-@ da ! ms. cuddles !
thought you might want to bring her along .
thanks .
i know you think i &apos;m a monster .
i mean , i did murder or heavily maim most of my immediate family ,
but after a long period of self @-@ reflection ,
i &apos;ve come to the conclusion
that i could have handled my anger better .
you said you wanted to get out of here , and i quote
&quot; to give the rest of the gemini coven an excruciating death . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mean it .
honestly , i would do anything
to get my family back .
and the thing i &apos;m most scared of
is trying to figure out how to live in the world again .
sort of hoping you &apos;ve been a positive influence on me .
you &apos;re a good person , bonnie .
you &apos;re brave , loyal , patient .
i want to be more like you .
what do you say ?
friends ?
let &apos;s just go home .
they &apos;re here .
mom ?
caroline , stop ! the border .
you &apos;re bleeding ? what &apos;d you do to her ?
i &apos;m fine .
ok . let &apos;s do this . let her go , and you can have him .
tripp first .
let her go , or i &apos;ll kill you .
sweetheart , it &apos;s ok .
stefan , let tripp go .
he &apos;s across . now let her go .
are you ok ?
what &apos;s happening to me ?
oh , my god .
what the hell did you do ?
wasn &apos;t me .
enzo must have turned him into a vampire
before we got there .
it &apos;s now or never .
just in case you thought you &apos;d try to go without me .
so long , 1994 .
what the hell &apos;s happening ?
i don &apos;t know .
keep going . hurry .
i can &apos;t .
keep going !
i can &apos;t . i &apos;ve lost my magic .
what are you talking about ?
you were just doing the spell .
there &apos;s nothing there .
there &apos;s no magic .
it &apos;s so strange .
i wonder if i accidentally put it somewhere .
oh , i remember now . i put it somewhere safe .
where did you put your magic ?
do you remember saying you wanted to be more like me --
brave , loyal , patient ?
you put it in the bear , didn &apos;t you ?
come on !
where &apos;s the stupid bear , hmm ?
oh , it &apos;s gone . i guess we &apos;re stuck here forever .
sorry .
i don &apos;t remember being here with you that night .
ok .
what do you remember ?
how are you rewired ?
i remember that we had to stop the travelers .
yeah .
you had a plan , but you didn &apos;t tell anyone what you were doing ,
and the next thing i know , you &apos;re dead .
i heard that you drove your car into the grill
and then blew yourself up so that you could trigger some explosion .
there &apos;s just one little part of that story that you &apos;re missing .
you got in the car with me .
what ? !
i was all ready to go , and the door opens ,
and you jump in the car and say ,
&quot; we &apos;re in this together , &quot;
and you weren &apos;t taking no for an answer .
that was the moment i realized you were the perfect girl for me
because you were just as crazy as i was .
ok . tell me more . something happy .
ok . happy . well , there is a motel ice machine
in denver that &apos;s got some stories .
what else ?
well , can &apos;t forget the night of your graduation .
well , i did , so ...
shame . probably one of your best speeches .
you in your very passionate and adorable way
told me you were in love with me ,
and hell if you were gonna apologize for it .
my favorite memory of us , oh ,
one that i &apos;ve relived a million times over the last 4 months
is this summer night that we had before you went off to college .
you wanted to show me this meteor shower ,
so we drove out in the middle of nowhere ,
and the moment those shooting stars started to fall , rain .
lots of rain .
you were so sure it would clear ,
and it was just easier to believe you ,
and i took your hand ...
this isn &apos;t working . i &apos;m sorry .
hey . maybe you just need to try a little harder .
i am trying !
i get that we had an amazing life together ,
and i know that i loved the fact
that you were reckless and probably
made me feel very free ,
but now when i look into your eyes , i just--
what ?
what do you feel like ?
i feel like ...
like i &apos;m looking at a stranger
because i &apos;m never gonna be able to give you what you want ,
because i just can &apos;t remember .
there is a thing that you can &apos;t erase , and you know that .
sorry .
where are you going ? elena ! hey !
elena !
elena !
what the hell are you doing ?
90 more seconds , you &apos;d be dead .
i &apos;m trying to undo the compulsion .
it &apos;s the only way .
no , no , no , no .
hey . listen .
i would give anything for you to remember ,
but i &apos;m not gonna risk your life .
it &apos;s the last thing i would ever do ...
even if you don &apos;t remember that .
let &apos;s get you home .
this is totally unnecessary .
you hit your head .
you could have a concussion ,
and i know better than to trust that
you &apos;re going to take yourself for a checkup back home .
you can go now . we &apos;re fine .
sweetheart , could you at least just check and see
how long the wait is gonna be ?
gladly .
ok .
i see she &apos;s still icing you out .
yeah . anyway , you want to help me fix that ?
sorry , stefan . i &apos;m her mother .
i &apos;m not allowed .
right .
we &apos;ll be right outside , ok ?
ok .
please don &apos;t ask my mother for her opinions .
you heard that ?
yeah . i &apos;ve got superhearing . i hear everything .
only when you listen .
why ?
why was i listening ?
why do you have a thing for me ?
i don &apos;t .
ok . um ...
why did you have a thing for me ?
we said that we would never talk about this again , so just--
look , caroline , please just talk to me .
tell me how , tell me why .
please just make me understand how it is that i missed it .
what kind of a stupid question is that ?
why did i have a thing for you ?
i don &apos;t know , stefan . maybe it &apos;s because i thought
you worth having a thing for ,
because when i woke up as a vampire
you told me that i would get through it
and i did ,
because when i watched elena move on with your brother
i couldn &apos;t imagine why she would let anyone like you go ,
because you were practically my best friend ,
because i trusted you .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry for not seeing it ,
i &apos;m sorry for not--
feeling it back ?
no . i didn &apos;t say that . i--i--
look . i don &apos;t know what i felt .
you know , my head was all over the place ,
but ...
i am incredibly sorry for the way that i treated you .
yeah . well ...
i know what you felt , stefan ,
because even if just a little tiny piece of you felt for me
what i was starting to feel for you
you wouldn &apos;t have walked away ,
and i don &apos;t hate you for that .
i don &apos;t hate you for mourning your brother ,
i don &apos;t hate you for being the biggest jerk on the planet
while doing so ,
and i accept your apology .
but you do still
hate me .
yes .
yeah , i hate you
because if i don &apos;t hate you for ruining our friendship ,
then i have to hate myself for ruining it ,
and i think that i deserve better than that .
i remembered something out there ,
just bits and pieces , but , um ...
there were these stars ,
and then it started to rain .
when you became a vampire , part of me was thrilled
because suddenly there was this possibility
i could have you in my life forever ,
but then the other part of me was devastated because
i realized you &apos;d lost the life that you wanted to have .
it started to rain , and then what happened , damon ?
and since i &apos;ve been gone , you &apos;ve gotten part of that life back .
you &apos;re thriving , you &apos;re happy .
yeah , sure . maybe you &apos;d be happy if we gave it another chance ,
but the truth is is ...
you &apos;re better off without me .
what are you talking about ?
i died . you started over .
i need you to live your life .
be happy .
i love you , elena .
enough to let you go .
it started to rain ,
and then what ?
it got cold and muddy .
you were miserable , so we got in the car
we drove home .
ok .
i might have to rethink this whole painkiller thing .
i need to get out of this dress and order a pizza .
ok .
ouch .
this ? yeah , i had an accident when i was younger .
i lost my spleen .
car accident ?
actually it was less an accident
and more like my brother tried to gut me with a hunting knife .
like i said , tragically dysfunctional family .
i just killed the mood , didn &apos;t i ?
no , no . let &apos;s just say ,
we both have complicated , tragic ,
and dysfunctional histories .
guess we &apos;re a match .
you &apos;re still talking to me .
sorry i ran out like that .
what &apos;s this ?
so i finally got a look at lady whitmore &apos;s labs .
turns out they sent her home without doing the shoulder surgery
because the injury doesn &apos;t exist anymore .
seems to have spontaneously healed itself ,
and all this after meeting your dead boyfriend tonight ?
none of this adds up .
the only thing that &apos;s really clear is that you &apos;re not just a liar ,
but you &apos;re a liar with secrets ,
so you can tell me the truth ,
or i can figure this out on my own .
one for you , one for me .
cheers , horatio fell .
come on . it &apos;s time to abandon ship .
no , no , no , wait .
just give it a second .
it will clear up .
promise me this is forever .
i promise .
to optimism .
bonnie .
you &apos;re still alive .
