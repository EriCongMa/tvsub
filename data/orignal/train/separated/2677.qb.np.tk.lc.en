oh , my goodness . do you know what this is ?
it &apos;s a fucking gun !
fucking jimmy &apos;s still in jail .
don &apos;t mean shit .
i don &apos;t like it . this is how it starts .
i think it was a potluck raid .
make it look like they &apos;re earning their pay .
i agree .
but why would pussy run ?
he &apos;s out of breath lifting his dick to take a leak .
oh , puss !
your ears must be ringing .
come on , run !
ha , ha . you guys are a fucking riot .
we were gonna draw straws to see who &apos;d bail you out .
my wife did . i nearly strangled her on the ride home .
my head &apos;s hurting , i got agita , and on top of that ...
... i threw my back out again .
maybe it was that 10 @-@ yard dash .
we don &apos;t run , it &apos;s embarrassing .
those federal pricks robbed me .
what ?
they grabbed four dimes from me .
you shouldn &apos;t carry that type of cash !
never mind , i need a drink .
oh , madonna ! che puzzo !
oh , jesus !
this better be good . i was fishing .
what , no &quot; how you been ? how &apos;s it doing , vin ? &quot;
i thought we understood each other .
i don &apos;t care about you , your family or whether you take it up the ass .
what &apos;s so important you take me away from my boat ?
fuckface , where you going ?
why do you talk to me like this ? i do risky shit for you .
you &apos;re not doing charity work , remember ?
all right , i &apos;m sorry .
hey , vin , how you doing ? what do you got for me ?
bompensiero .
pussy ?
what about him ?
he &apos;s wired for sound .
what ?
i got it from a good source . i thought you should know . all right ?
i &apos;m sorry . i know you like him .
like him ?
i fucking love him .
now , who &apos;s your source ?
he &apos;s on the force . he &apos;s on the task force , all right ?
look , he &apos;s not lying to me . he was in my wedding .
i want to see the report .
i can &apos;t .
i want to see the fucking 302 !
all right , all right . i &apos;ll see what i can do .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
yeah , it does , tone , if you take the blinders off .
i &apos;m in homicide . i was told he moved heavy h to pay for his kid &apos;s college .
why would i know something like that ?
last spring , with that big heroin bust , where was he ?
he told you he was in las vegas . am i right ?
i &apos;m sorry , but that &apos;s where he was . he was in las vegas .
he was in a federal building , cutting a deal .
why did he walk so easy from that thing the other day ?
known wiseguy , resisted arrest .
who walks away from a thing like that with low @-@ ball bail ?
why would he do it ?
he &apos;s facing a possible sentence of &quot; from now on , &quot; mandatory .
i know a lot of guys who can &apos;t do that kind of time .
who is this guy pussy ?
he &apos;s a man who loves his family above all else .
well , guess what ? that &apos;s their favorite target .
ma , you sure ? because i &apos;d be glad to ...
okay , that &apos;s fine .
i just said it &apos;s fine .
was that my mother ?
she &apos;s not coming .
like you expected different ?
i hoped .
every year we have open house , and she pulls the same shit .
it &apos;s negative attention @-@ getting .
maybe i should call her back .
that &apos;s what she wants you to do . come here .
you &apos;re being too nice .
forget about her , she &apos;ll be fine .
can you get the guys to help you move the piano ?
they &apos;re coming to get it because some people don &apos;t play .
i will .
when ? it &apos;s been gathering dust .
oh , puss ! come here !
excuse me .
what do you need ?
we gotta move this . i want to slide it out of the way .
i can &apos;t .
the fucking thing &apos;s on wheels .
my back . i &apos;m thinking about going home , sitting in the tub .
you all right ?
yeah , it &apos;s just my back . they got me on these elephant pills .
all right , go easy on them .
go ahead , sit down . take it easy .
keep your eye on pussy . something &apos;s wrong . he &apos;s not himself .
you &apos;re telling me ?
he hasn &apos;t done his rounds in a week .
he &apos;s starting to look like an easy mark .
i told him , &quot; someone owes you money , even if you gotta crawl , you get it . &quot;
i even told him to give me his list , and i &apos;ll collect the fucking thing .
what &apos;d he say ?
he just nodded like a fucking retard .
it &apos;s those fucking percs .
he &apos;s throwing them in his mouth like m &amp; m &apos;s .
there isn &apos;t even anything wrong with his back .
what do you mean ?
remember when that guy hit me with a pool cue and i fucked my neck up ?
down at the shore .
right .
i went to this doctor . he works on the jets when they get hurt .
that so ?
he &apos;s fucking like the jonas salk of backs . anyway ...
... i send pussy to this doctor . the guy gives him the works :
mris , cat scans , dog scans , you name it .
he says there &apos;s not a thing wrong with his back .
then again , he says , when it comes to backs ...
... nobody knows anything , really .
you know , i was on a good run , and then , boom !
it &apos;s like i &apos;m walking down the street ...
... and i &apos;m looking up because i feel like a safe &apos;s gonna land on my head .
a feeling of pending doom ?
let me ask you a question .
this mental stuff can cause physical problems , right ?
are you having any physical problems ?
no , no , i &apos;m fine .
but i got a friend ...
... a dear , dear friend , and i &apos;m concerned about him .
what &apos;s wrong with him ?
it &apos;s his back .
see , he &apos;s complaining about his back ...
... but the doctor thinks it &apos;s all in his head .
that &apos;s very possible .
what do you think ?
i think we should just keep this about you .
this is about me .
every time i offer my opinion about any of your friends ...
... it seems to interfere with our therapy .
you start cursing and screaming .
what kind of mental stuff would cause a backache ?
for conversation &apos;s sake ?
absolutely .
with some people , the pain is ...
... caused by more responsibility than they can handle .
well , that makes sense . i mean ...
... he &apos;s got a lot of bills , a lot of problems with his kid &apos;s school fund .
secrets .
what do you mean ?
psychologically , a secret is a heavy load .
it leads to feelings of guilt , which further burden the mind .
if you want my opinion , this can &apos;t be true .
thanks , debbie .
you know , i told you that i would do what i could ...
... but this is dea , feds , task force .
this is not as easy as you think .
getting my hands on the 302 .
now , you listen to me .
this is the most serious decision i &apos;ve ever had to make .
and i need proof .
i won &apos;t hurt a man that i love because of some cop gossip ...
... from a degenerate fucking gambler with a badge .
you know , you got an amazing ability to sum up ...
... a man &apos;s whole life in a single sentence .
degenerate gambler with a badge , huh ?
you &apos;re a pisser . you &apos;re a real pisser .
i &apos;m under pressure . i don &apos;t have time to suck your dick !
apology accepted .
fuck you !
fuck me ?
yeah , fuck you !
you know , when i was a kid ....
when i was a kid and my old man would be in one of his ways ...
... with the screaming back and forth ...
... it &apos;d end with her throwing the closest thing to her .
he &apos;d smack her around !
i don &apos;t know why ...
... but i would run into my room and i would hide under my bed .
there was something peaceful and something safe under that bed .
and that &apos;s where i would wake up the next day .
everything back to normal .
how about you ?
do you ever feel like hiding under a bed ?
yeah . right now .
you &apos;re a prick to the end , right ?
you really like this place , huh ?
it &apos;s my getaway .
this is where debbie &apos;s taken care of me for years .
i &apos;ll bet she has .
i &apos;m serious , she has .
there were times when i had a great weekend with the football ...
... and i &apos;d come here with a pocketful of money , shitfaced ...
... and every fucking penny would be there when i got up in the morning .
she is an honest lady .
she &apos;d do anything for you , anything .
you come in here , you flash your badge , you get free pussy .
fuck pussy . i wouldn &apos;t fuck one of these broads with your dick .
they have absolutely no class , and they &apos;re always on the hustle .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re supposed to do , no ?
&quot; oh , hello , carmela . how nice to see you . &quot;
how are you feeling ?
oh , what can i say ? what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a ricotta pie . i saved it from the open house .
are you wearing makeup ?
i can &apos;t eat that . it &apos;s got cholesterol !
i made it with the low @-@ fat cheese .
well , maybe your friends will eat it .
what friends ?
fine , you can eat it when junior visits .
you know , your son loves you very much .
he worries all the time .
he felt bad that you didn &apos;t come to the open house .
i don &apos;t care if you think it &apos;s disrespectful ...
... but i want you to cut the drama . it &apos;s killing tony .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about this &quot; poor mother , nobody loves me &quot; crap .
it is textbook manipulation ...
... and i hate seeing tony so upset over it .
i know how to talk to people .
well , i am a mother too , don &apos;t forget .
you know your power , and you use it like a pro .
power , what power ? i don &apos;t have power . i &apos;m a shut @-@ in !
you are bigger than life !
you are his mother !
i think that you know what you &apos;re doing .
who , me ? what did i do ?
look , i didn &apos;t come by to argue .
i came by to check on you and to bring you the ricotta .
if you don &apos;t want it , give it to junior . i know he stops by a lot .
he &apos;s my husband &apos;s brother .
he can &apos;t check up on me once in a while ?
that &apos;s none of anybody &apos;s business .
i am not saying that .
i &apos;m saying if you don &apos;t want it , give it to junior .
i know what you &apos;re hinting at .
ma , there is nothing wrong with companionship !
what is wrong ?
wait until you &apos;re abandoned .
abandoned ? please !
when johnny was alive ...
... nobody treated me like this .
what are you talking about ? who is treating you bad ?
tony would rather die than see you hurt .
johnny was a saint .
yes , we heard .
funny , i don &apos;t remember you telling him that when he was alive .
junior couldn &apos;t carry johnny &apos;s socks .
do you think i &apos;d blacken my johnny &apos;s memory ...
... by getting mixed up with his brother ?
i didn &apos;t say that .
we &apos;re only happy you and junior get along so well .
at least with junior ...
... i &apos;ve got some purpose in life .
somebody listens to me and doesn &apos;t treat me like an old shoe !
jesus !
don &apos;t worry about the dish . i &apos;ll come back tomorrow and get it .
hey , college boy !
yo , dad ! it &apos;s uncle tony .
there he is , the beached whale !
hey , tony , what are you doing here ?
i figured you &apos;d be having a cannoli withdrawal by now .
spinellis ?
no , stop &apos; n &apos; shop . what do you think ?
hey , you &apos;re the best . hey , kev , put those on a dish .
wait till after supper .
your dad tells me you &apos;re taking astronomy in college .
no , business .
how come he keeps saying you &apos;re taking up space in school ?
madonna ! don &apos;t make me laugh . it kills my back .
he &apos;s a good @-@ looking kid .
sure he &apos;s yours ?
you &apos;re lucky my wife &apos;s not home . she &apos;d toss you out for that .
i know .
that &apos;s a good boy .
i pray to god i keep that tuition coming in .
he can go to city college .
he &apos;s staying where he is . he isn &apos;t getting fucked because his old man is !
you ought to relax . you ought to take it easy a little .
take it easy . how the fuck can i take it easy ?
things are happening , tony .
what kind of things ?
things !
this back has taken me out of the game . i &apos;m behind .
and i think i &apos;m getting hooked on these fucking painkillers !
i don &apos;t know , i feel like someone put the malocchio on me .
puss ...
... you got options .
don &apos;t let anyone make you feel ...
... like you don &apos;t have options because you got friends .
look at me .
friends that would die for you .
you understand me ?
friends .
yeah , i know .
you got anything you want to say to me ?
like what ?
like , &quot; you want some coffee ? you want something to eat ? &quot;
you want coffee ?
yeah .
you think i &apos;d let you eat those cannolis by yourself ?
you beached whale .
here .
what ?
help me . who &apos;ll make the coffee , you ?
one , two , three .
you look good .
what &apos;s up , t ?
sit .
fucking traffic !
i would have been here 20 minutes ago .
want a drink ?
you okay ?
he &apos;s wearing a wire .
who ?
pussy .
oh , get the fuck out of here . our pussy ?
don &apos;t know how long .
are you sure about this , tony ?
ninety percent .
not enough to do what needs to be done .
jesus ! i &apos;m fucking dreaming here .
well , get used to it .
i &apos;ve been walking into walls all week .
i &apos;ll do it .
my responsibility .
you waited a long time for the stripes .
this is one of the perks .
i &apos;ll do it .
we need to be 110 percent sure .
i want you to see it .
i want you to see that fucking wire strapped on his body .
i want you to see it .
you hear me ?
i want you to see it .
otherwise , all bets are off .
you understand ?
this is our friend we &apos;re talking about here .
you say it .
you understand ?
i understand .
come in .
mr. soprano .
are you busy ?
no , no , no . come in , please .
i was in the neighborhood , figured i &apos;d stop by and see my mother .
brought her some mario lanza .
she loves the old guys .
i &apos;m a little worried about her . you know , she &apos;s always been depressed .
sometimes these half @-@ assed tenors can really do the trick .
you know where she is ? she &apos;s not in her room .
i wanted to tell her her house went into escrow .
she &apos;s with the other girls getting aqua therapy .
my mother ?
the physical therapist told her if she didn &apos;t get exercise ...
... her back was gonna arch like an old lady .
i didn &apos;t know she had a bathing suit .
she &apos;s more connected to the world .
which one , this one or neptune ?
no , really .
i think your uncle &apos;s visits have a lot to do with it .
oh , she looks forward to them .
could you excuse me one moment ?
yeah , sure . you know , just ....
tell her her house sold and they accepted the counteroffer .
okay . yeah , i &apos;ll be right there .
i &apos;m leaving , guys .
see you later , pussy .
i &apos;ll tell you if that horse runs .
don &apos;t do me any favors .
follow me .
where ?
it &apos;s a surprise .
come on , you hard @-@ on , before we get a ticket .
paulie , i &apos;ve been here before . what the fuck you want ?
look around , i &apos;ll give you three guesses .
come on , down here .
we &apos;ll grab a rubdown after .
here .
i don &apos;t know .
come on , get undressed . it &apos;s on me .
why do you think those russians live so long ?
they take a schvitz every day .
i can &apos;t .
don &apos;t be like that . it &apos;s a gift . take your clothes off .
what ? want me to turn around ?
the doctor said heat &apos;s no good for me . that &apos;s why i sit in the shade .
what are you talking about ? heat is good for your back !
take your clothes off !
look , paulie , i appreciate it . maybe another time , huh ?
take your clothes off .
you &apos;re fucking crazy . i &apos;m going home .
why don &apos;t you want to take your clothes off ?
i got high blood pressure ! i go in there , i could check out !
my doctor mentioned steam and sauna specifically as no @-@ noes .
he said stay the fuck away from heat !
thanks for the thought . but get out of my fucking face .
what &apos;d you find out ?
it &apos;s good . it &apos;s fucking very good !
spit it out .
he &apos;s into pussy , big .
and i mean with a capital b.
this fucking makazian , he &apos;s a lying motherfucker !
he &apos;s into pussy for 30 large . twenty grand , just on football !
and the rest is shy .
pussy must be burying his prick in vig alone .
doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s a liar .
just means he &apos;s got a reason to see pussy dead . it buys him time .
could this prick have the balls to try something like this ?
hey , we &apos;re talking about 30 grand here !
i don &apos;t even want to think about what we &apos;d do to remove that debt .
i wouldn &apos;t bet football .
i gotta think about this .
look , t ...
... if my vote counts for anything ...
... i cannot believe that pussy would fear the can enough ...
... to hurt his friends .
that &apos;s what they said about gravano .
all right , go back in . i gotta think .
deb ?
debbie ?
take it easy with her .
i &apos;d think a whore would like pain .
take it easy !
vinnie , stop it !
come on , let &apos;s get this show on the road !
look at this . a doctor , a madam , a wiseguy and a cop .
that &apos;s what i call a vice superfecta .
the four were arrested last night .
a spokesman says that the officer in question will be placed on leave ...
... pending the outcome of the hearing this morning .
hate to be there when he got home .
i don &apos;t know which is worse :
to be caught in a bordello or to be caught with the wiseguy .
asshole !
what &apos;s a bordello ?
a fancy name for a whorehouse .
don &apos;t start , okay ?
it is !
i just don &apos;t like that talk .
most civilized countries have legalized prostitution .
you got somewhere to be ?
it &apos;s a joke , look at the president .
he deserved what he got .
he got monica kazinski and the broad with the long nose .
sex shouldn &apos;t be a punishable offense .
i don &apos;t think sex should
be a punishable offense either .
but talking about sex at the breakfast table is a punishable offense .
no more sex talk , okay ?
it &apos;s the &apos; 90s , parents are supposed to discuss sex with their children .
but that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong .
you see , out there , it &apos;s the 1990s , but in this house ...
... it &apos;s 1954 .
1990s , 1954 .
so now and forever , i don &apos;t want to hear any more sex talk .
what &apos;s with him ?
keep moving , please .
come on !
come on , goddamn it !
come on , let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go !
let &apos;s go !
go ahead , detective .
excuse me , move it out , please . got a police officer here .
move it out ! let &apos;s go ! pull up !
police vehicle ! coming through !
are you sure ? who told you this ?
what ?
yeah , yeah , i &apos;m still here .
all right , thanks . i &apos;ll talk to you later .
you gonna tell me ?
the fucking jerk did a header off the route 1 bridge .
who ?
makazian .
fuck !
there goes our only shot to find out for sure the truth about pussy .
well , if it matters , he always said how much he respected you .
it matters .
he helped me out of a lot of jams . not just with the law .
what was he thinking ?
he could &apos;ve kept his job . he might have been suspended , that &apos;s all .
it &apos;s not like he was dealing .
that &apos;s not why he did it .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it was the straw ...
... but he was not happy ...
... with himself , how he turned out .
what did he come here for , therapy ?
you could say that .
instead of a couch , you use a bed ?
it &apos;s not a bad deal .
who wouldn &apos;t want to sleep with their shrink ?
what &apos;s that mean ?
you &apos;d be amazed how easy it is to open up when you &apos;re naked ...
... and in the arms of someone who cares for you .
did he ever mention anything about my guys to you ?
he didn &apos;t like paulie . he thought he was a psycho .
what about pussy ?
he really didn &apos;t have much to say about any of you guys .
except that he owed some money .
but he wasn &apos;t worried because you liked him ...
... and while he had you in his corner , there was nothing to worry about .
i won &apos;t lie , he &apos;s dead . he didn &apos;t have a good thing to say about anyone .
he did feel like he could trust you .
he said a lot , &quot; at least with tony soprano ,
you know where you stand . &quot;
livia , open up , it &apos;s junior !
come on in , it &apos;s open .
what &apos;s going on ?
my dominican girl said you called me .
... he sold our house .
don &apos;t people have names ? who &apos;s &quot; he &quot; ?
anthony .
he sold my house !
the home my husband and i made !
what else were they gonna do with it ?
you too !
i suppose he would &apos;ve found it harder to have his meetings at my house ...
... than in this nursing home .
what are you talking about ?
don &apos;t think i &apos;ll ever see any of that money , either .
what meetings ?
raymond , larry !
that sneak from manhattan .
johnny sack ? johnny sack was here ?
with his mohair suits and his shoe lifts .
suits , pleurisy ?
more than once he was there ? why didn &apos;t i know about this ?
maybe it was you they were talking about , who knows ?
well , i just don &apos;t like being put in the middle of things !
i should &apos;ve known something was strange ...
... when suddenly larry boy &apos;s mother moved in here .
and then jimmy altieri &apos;s mother .
three of my capos have their moms here ?
instead of living in normal homes with their sons ...
... like human beings .
this must be some kind of fucking end move .
what do they think , i &apos;m stupid ?
we &apos;ll see .
wait a minute !
i don &apos;t like that kind of talk !
now just stop it , it upsets me !
or i won &apos;t tell you anything anymore .
if this is true , livia , you know what i ... i mean ...
i &apos;m the boss , for chrissake ! if i don &apos;t act , blood or no ...
i have to .
oh , god , why ?
what did i say now ?
i suppose i should &apos;ve just kept my mouth shut , like a mute .
and then everybody would &apos;ve been happy .
anthony , see who &apos;s there .
i &apos;m eating .
you won &apos;t have any teeth left if you don &apos;t go see !
make sure you know who it is before you answer .
who is coming at dinner ? people can &apos;t call ?
it &apos;s uncle jimmy !
uncle jimmy ? let him in !
i don &apos;t believe it , how &apos;d you get out ?
carm , look who &apos;s here ! jimmy , he &apos;s out !
oh , my god , jimmy !
thought you &apos;d never see me again ?
what happened ?
got someplace in private we can talk ?
yeah , in the basement .
what &apos;s going on ?
you got a problem !
yeah , i know . i &apos;m working on it .
working on what ?
why , what were you gonna say ?
you better lay low with that safe @-@ house money .
what ?
they were asking me a lot of questions in there .
if i knew anything about the dead colombian in the apartment .
you look good .
thanks , i wasn &apos;t gone that long .
yeah , yeah , i know .
my lawyer told him , &quot; hey , he doesn &apos;t own the building .
he &apos;s not responsible for what &apos;s in it . &quot;
i told him the pool table was there when i first rented the joint .
good thinking .
you should &apos;ve been a lawyer .
please , enough people hate me .
so what are you gonna do about the colombian money ?
they were putting it to me like i was a kid .
telling me the money was marked .
they said there &apos;s a new fingerprint technique , lifts them off the bills .
you &apos;re a lucky man , jimmy !
what do you mean ?
you &apos;re out on bail on that conspiracy thing ?
yeah , so ?
only you would get pinched with a gun while you &apos;re out on bail ...
... and still be out in time for dinner .
you &apos;re a lucky guy !
speaking of dinner , carmela &apos;s got some lasagna upstairs .
i &apos;ll pass . i got a few people to see that are late with payments .
i gotta show my face or they &apos;ll think they &apos;re off the hook .
get off the phone !
i gotta go !
what &apos;s up ?
it &apos;s jimmy ! it &apos;s fucking jimmy !
what ?
the wire , it &apos;s jimmy !
what are you talking about ?
the wire , you understand ? the wire , it &apos;s fucking jimmy !
i should &apos;ve killed him right in my fucking basement !
makazian &apos;s guy got mixed up . they got busted at the same time .
jimmy and pussy ! you understand ?
two fat fucks with black hair ! where the fuck is paulie ?
he called an hour ago . he said he &apos;s on his way .
why the fuck isn &apos;t he here now ?
jesus , tony .

shut up . god forbid .
don &apos;t talk like that .
where &apos;s pussy ? get him on the phone .
i haven &apos;t seen him since paulie took him to the schvitz .
hey , fellas !
