can &apos;t . booked a car show for tomorrow ,
and i have been so good this week .
i lost four pounds .
oh , come on , cece .
it &apos;s your birthday . we &apos;re gonna eat cake ,
we &apos;re gonna watch clueless on vhs ,
and we &apos;re gonna try to make prom dresses out of towels .
obviously , just like we always do .
as if !
as if is , like , the funniest thing ever .
i wish i had a stepbrother to fall in love with .
i know , right ? paul rudd .
you know , actually , i thought maybe this year ,
we could go out , you know ?
we go party tonight .
let dogs out . catch gypsy .
yeah . yeah , nadia wants me
to go to this last @-@ minute thing she found out about ,
so i thought we could all , you know , just go out tonight .
you , me , nadia , the girls .
the models ?
yes , jess , the models . please ?
you and i have never spent my birthday apart , ever .
except for the one time in seventh grade
where you walked out of my sleepover
because you claimed ...
when you struck me in the breast .
but i didn &apos;t even touch boob , because you know ,
we all knew you were stuffing ...
oh , my god .
we were all stuffing . stuffing ? we all stuffed .
you &apos;ve seen my grandmother . i was not stuffing .
yes , we were .
it was seventh grade .
i &apos;ve been like this since i was seven .
you &apos;re ...
come out with us tonight !
please , please , please !
okay .
okay .
i &apos;ll come .
thank you .
i so excited .
i shake this thing that my mama gave me .
yolo !
the galapagos tortoise ,
or galapagos giant tortoise ,
unbelievable ...
is the largest living species of tortoise ...
spectacular .
hey , do you think
jess would be mad if i got a turtle
and named it jess ,
even though i had that name picked out before she moved in ?
a turtle ?
thinking man &apos;s best friend , schmidty .
in our home ? over my turtle @-@ disease @-@ ridden dead body .
whatever , dream killer . what &apos;s this ?
got you a cookie .
what , you have , like ... ?
have , like , an extra ?
no .
so you just , like , got me a cookie ?
yeah , i was thinking about you .
what do you mean you were thinking about me ?
what do you mean ? i don &apos;t know . i was thinking about you .
think about you a lot , bro .
why ?
i don &apos;t know . because you &apos;re my friend ,
you &apos;re on my mind .
what , do you not think about me ?
of course not !
schmidt got me a cookie .
oh . very nice .
what do you guys think ?
whoa ! - - smokin &apos; hot .
i &apos;m going out tonight with cece and her model friends ,
and i &apos;m going for &quot; promising ballerina turned streetwalker . &quot;
you have too much joie de vivre .
okay , you want to look a little bit more bored , tired .
just altogether disengaged .
more tired-- more , like , sick @-@ like .
really let your bones prop you up .
did you put shoe polish on your eyes ?
i never understand you women-- god .
eye shadow , man .
that &apos;s ... ?
oh , that &apos;s makeup ?
i would take that off .
that looks crazy .
can &apos;t believe i have to deal with the models
just to hang out with cece .
last time we hung out , it was awful .
i figure the best way to talk to models
is just point to objects and describe them .
the table is round .
it &apos;s also flat .
yes , the table is round , and it &apos;s flat .
oh , look , a lamp .
i love cece , and these are cece &apos;s friends ,
so i should be able to get along with them .
i should be able to deal with the fact
that they think i look like a monkey ...
from a russian cracker ad .
whatever .
it &apos;s cece &apos;s birthday . it &apos;s her special night .
i can get drunk , point at furniture
if that means i can spend some quality time with my bff .
hey , is it totally obvious that i &apos;m not wearing underwear ?
because it should be .
and that makes two of us .
you made it !
sorry i &apos;m late .
they let in a lot of people ahead of me-- like , a lot .
saving the best for last .
monkey cracker .
monkey cracker .
monkey ,
monkey , where you keep the crackers ?
this is so much fun .
schmidt ?
so , it turns out
there &apos;s more than one type of turtle .
i could go eastern box , or spur thighed ,
or nearsighted loner .
what was that ? you just grunt at me ?
wasn &apos;t a grunt .
that was a grunt , schmidt .
it was a &quot; hurumph . &quot;
a hurumph sounds like this &quot; hurumph . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry if you took it the wrong way ; it was not a grunt .
serena williams . that was a grunt .
it &apos;s all good , man , all right ?
it &apos;s all &quot; smoove in the groove . &quot;
mellow , man .
mega @-@ mellow .
okay .
schmidt , what the hell are you doing ?
you don &apos;t think about me ?
what are you talking about ?
earlier today , when i gave you the cookie ,
i heard very clearly , &quot; i don &apos;t think about you , schmidt . &quot;
why would i think about you ? !
because we &apos;re friends , we &apos;re not animals .
we &apos;re men , schmidt !
the only time a man is allowed to think
about another man is when that man is jay cutler .
i don &apos;t know who jay cutler is !
why are you saying &quot; cutler &quot; like that ?
and i also don &apos;t know what is allowed
in the cold @-@ hearted republic of nick miller ,
but i do know how i feel .
ugh !
and i know how much you love cookies .
and i saw it there behind the glass ,
and i thought , &quot; nick miller-- i &apos;m gonna buy him that . &quot;
if i could give you that cookie back , i would .
nothing would make me happier than to throw it up ,
mash it into cookie @-@ shape , and shove it down your throat !
you wanna mama @-@ bird me the cookie ?
no , that &apos;s not ...
you wanna mama @-@ bird me the cookie ?
no .
you &apos;re not mama @-@ birding anybody any cookie .
schmidt , i don &apos;t want to mama @-@ bird you a cookie .
what is your problem , schmidt ?
no mama @-@ birding here !
okay , i think i got it , okay--
monkey , monkey , where you keep your cracker ?
monkey , monkey , you are comrade best !
-whoo .
you know what ?
the dance is surprisingly sexual for a children &apos;s cracker .
do song again . &quot; dance monkey . &quot;
i don &apos;t want to dance ...
&quot; dance monkey . &quot;
monkey , monkey , where you keep your crackers ?
dance monkey , dance monkey .
cracker , please !
dance monkey .
cracker , please !
monkey ! monkey !
no . you know what ?
monkey ! monkey !
monkey ! monkey ! monkey !
monkey , monkey , monkey !
dance monkey ... - - you know what ?
no ! stop it !
i don &apos;t want to , okay ? i &apos;m done .
you guys are the worst !
you &apos;re the worst . i &apos;m sorry , but it &apos;s true .
all these racist in @-@ jokes about romanians .
well , guess what ? i &apos;m one @-@ eighth romanian !
monkey , no !
and i don &apos;t know
why cece would want to spend her birthday here .
it &apos;s like years of modeling have made her dumber .
nice , jess .
no ! cece .
no , i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t ...
it &apos;s official .
we got to turtle @-@ proof this loft .
schmidt cares about you so much , man ,
and you don &apos;t even think about him .
are you being serious right now ?
are you really taking schmidt &apos;s side on this ?
i am , because i know how you are .
i just don &apos;t know why he would run away .
all i ever did was love him .
this rock is so round .
i &apos;m gonna go put it in a jar .
and nothing has changed . nothing has changed , nick .
you think schmidt is in the right ,
and i am in the wrong here ?
you realize i say good night to you every night ,
and you never say good night back ?
no .
what is the problem , nick ?
do you not want me to have a good night ?
i can &apos;t just go around saying good night to everyone ,
and buying people cookies .
i am not a titan of finance , sir .
do you know , once a week he goes into your room and cleans it ,
and then returns everything the way he found it ?
and i &apos;m weird in this situation ?
the dirty old t @-@ shirts , which he washes .
i didn &apos;t ask for that-- i like living in my filthy messes .
that &apos;s the point , man . you didn &apos;t have to ask .
nobody buys people cookies for no reason .
you still don &apos;t get it , do you ?
nobody .
that wasn &apos;t a cookie , damn it ! that was a ...
what ?
man , that was a piece of his heart .
now , if you don &apos;t mind , good ... night .
i &apos;m sorry , but in my defense , nadia just spent an hour
explaining to me how to drink vodka with my butt .
you just embarrassed me in front of my colleagues .
are you kidding me ? it &apos;s not like you work in the un .
you judge me for being a model .
yes , i do .
you always have .
it &apos;s your birthday , and you won &apos;t eat cake .
cece , you &apos;re better than that ; you really are .
i just ... i just feel sorry for you sometimes .
you feel sorry for me ?
you just hit me in the boob .
it was an accident .
it was not an accident .
fine . it wasn &apos;t .
oh ... my ... god !
what ? huh ?
you want that ? !
go . just go .
what you gonna do now , huh ?
just ...
what ?
what ? what ? what ?
what ?
what ? what ?
what ?
you should go .
thanks for a great birthday .
cece ?
you drink with mouth ?
tonight , i drink with mouth .
well , guess who &apos;s not getting a turtle ?
they were out of turtles .
i bought a tiny cowboy hat for nothing .
schmidt &apos;s not talking to you right now .
we &apos;re still on this ?
schmidt is tired of doing things for you that go unnoticed .
things like lining your shoes up at the door ...
don &apos;t line my shoes up at the door any more .
... recording your favorite tv shows ...
i appreciate that .
... the turn @-@ down service .
the turn @-@ down service is weird
and i never asked you to do that .
well , i guess those chocolate mints
just disappeared on their own .
oh , i thought we weren &apos;t talking .
we &apos;re not .
then why do i hear words
coming out that stupid hole in your face ?
i &apos;m a human being , and i &apos;m entitled to my emotions .
are you crying ?
no .
are you seriously crying , schmidt ?
i &apos;m not crying .
rough night , you guys .
i forgot to take out my contacts .
i think they &apos;re fused to my eyeballs .
what &apos;s going on ?
did you guys watch porn together again ?
why do you keep doing that ?
it &apos;s always awkward .
what the hell was that ?
in march , i will have been living with schmidt for ten years .
i know that because he sent me an e @-@ mail asking
how i want to celebrate our &quot; tin anniversary . &quot;
how did you guys become friends ?
was it an accident ?
did you hit him with your car
and you became his reluctant caretaker ?
he lived in my freshman dorm .
and one day , he was just there .
hey , hey , whoa , man , what are you doing in here ?
that &apos;s my ramen .
it &apos;s better this way .
y @-@ you add water to it , you weirdo .
it &apos;s not a dry treat , it &apos;s a soup .
who are you ?
schmidt .
you freak me out , man .
this is cool . we got a good vibe going , man .
you &apos;re a super weird guy .
hey , sit there while i throw things at you .
body slam !
no !
don &apos;t do this ! no !
and then he was always there .
and the truth is , is ,
schmidt loves me so much ,
and to be honest , jess , it scares me .
i mean , i don &apos;t think i deserve all of schmidt &apos;s love .
all i do is tease him .
i mean , of course you do .
that &apos;s all you can do .
do you think i &apos;m a bad friend ?
no , no , i &apos;m a bad friend .
i got mad at cece for being a model .
it &apos;s a dumb thing to be .
we got in a boob fight .
feels like i fell forward on a treadmill .
i &apos;m just gonna say this
i find that arousing , and let &apos;s move on .
just , she &apos;s smart , you know , and she &apos;s interesting
and she could be doing anything else with her life
or at least trying .
you know , the weird thing is ,
i was actually there when she got discovered .
you , take your glasses off .
okay .
i can take my glasses off .
i guess i was always disappointed with her
for calling that lady .
it &apos;s just , when i hear all the stuff about cece &apos;s profession
like , the dieting-- it &apos;s crazy-
and the butt drinking and the ...
did you say &quot; butt drinking &quot; ?
yeah .
you can &apos;t say &quot; butt drinking &quot;
and then not explain what it is .
it has two of my four favorite things .
i just feel like we have nothing in common , you know ?
yeah .
do you ever wonder
why we &apos;re friends with these people , jess ?
and , worse , if we met them now ,
you think we &apos;d still be friends with them ?
maybe not .
i should go talk to her .
well , nick , i &apos;m out of tears-- plumb out .
all that &apos;s left is just yellowish goo .
that &apos;s right , nick-- goo .
that &apos;s a third of my life .
cece .
oh , hey , nadia , sorry .
this wilmer valderrama .
um , nadia , that &apos;s not--
i mean--
or what i thought he would look like in person .
nice to meet you .
big fan .
where &apos;s cece ?
cece drink too much .
she puke , puke , puke .
she puke , cry , puke , cry .
she &apos;s so weak .
you put on pajama , wilmer valderrama , top only .
then , you make me salad , bitch .
let &apos;s , let &apos;s get you into bed , okay ?
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re doing any modeling today .
no , i have to go , jess , i have to go .
it &apos;s my job , all right ?
you know what , cece ?
i &apos;m so sorry about last night .
i know that you &apos;re ...
i know you &apos;re an intelligent person ,
and sometimes i just ...
i just get mixed up , you know ,
and i think that you &apos;re like me .
don &apos;t , don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m here .
just tell me where to stand and what we &apos;re selling .
i &apos;m gonna give it everything i got .
i &apos;m calling your agency .
this is totally unprofessional .
don &apos;t call my agency .
just tell me where to stand .
up on the spinning platform .
yeah , i can &apos;t do that .
okay .
please , seriously don &apos;t . i can &apos;t lose this job .
no .
don &apos;t call the agency , okay ?
i &apos;ll do it .
what ?
i &apos;m actually a model , too , mostly in japan .
um , they call me giggle bangs rice bowl .
i know you &apos;re lying and i just don &apos;t care .
get over to hair and makeup now .
cool .
these things are heavy .
it &apos;s like chain mail on my eyes .
so , your job is to highlight the features of the car
