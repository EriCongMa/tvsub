第六季 第十七集
Madam State's Attorney.
Thank you, David.
Well done, Alicia, truly.
Julius, you're back.
We're closing the New York offices.
Wow, thank you, everyone.
I'm honored, I am.
Thank you.
Her office is mine.
Already called dibs.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
This is insane.
Wow, look at all this stuff.
I want the muffins.
And whatever this is.
Well, thank you, police union.
What are you doing?
I'm not working today.
I'm gonna have a celebratory glass.
You can't-- you're only allowed to consume gifts
under $75 according to Cook County ethics rules.
You're kidding.
No.
I've been reading up on them.
Here, have a muffin.
Well, what do I do with this-- it's open.
Breakage.
Mr. Castro.
Alicia.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Ah, yes.
The honeymoon period.
Oh, this is, uh, Marissa, she's my...
Executive assistant.
...my executive assistant.
May I, uh, sit?
Oh, yes, please.
Um, uh... here.
Do you mind if we speak alone?
Oh, um, Marissa is helping me through the transition.
I trust her implicitly.
Muffin?
No, thank you.
Alicia, we've had our differences,
but I want to bury the hatchet.
I want this passing of the baton to be smooth.
Likewise.
Uh, one way to assure that success is
continuity in the office,
which is why I strongly urge you
to keep Phil Lorie as chief deputy.
He's, uh, he's a good strategist,
not to mention loyal.
I'm sure he is.
But I am going in another direction.
So thank you, but no.
Uh, one more thing.
I'm sure I don't need to mention this,
but it is customary for the incoming SA not to investigate ...
Cary, hang on, can you take a look at this?
...the outgoing SA especially given our, uh, past encounters.
You mean the prosecution of my partner?
Yes, given that,
I thought I would remind you of that rule.
That unwritten rule.
When I became SA,
I was encouraged to look forward,
not back, and there were a lot of things
to look back at with your husband.
If there was a gross mishandling of cases, James,
they shouldn't be swept under the rug, should they?
You come after me,
I will...
You'll what, James?
You're a lame duck.
Well...
A lame duck can still tank your record
before you get started.
I can overload you with loser cases
so your stats will be screwed
when you drop them.
Is there a problem?
Your friend, Alicia Florrick,
she's playing on a field where she thinks she knows the rules.
She doesn't.
For the record, you have my permission to hold a grudge.
Congratulations, Ms. State's Attorney.
Thank you, Cary.
It's like, uh, King Tut's tomb in here.
Yeah.
If King Tut didn't have to obey the ethic rules.
Sorry.
Kalinda, good morning.
Congratulations.
Thank you, are you on your way in?
We are swimming in wine and champagne here.
Cheap champagne.
Sounds good.
Listen, Lemond Bishop asked me to call.
Uh, I think he wants to talk.
Okay, good.
Tell him to come on in.
Come on in?
Uh, are you sure?
Look, he's fine on the phone.
No, no, I think it's better in the open.
Okay, look, I think he wants to talk about...
what you could do for him.
Yeah, okay, tell him to come on in.
I'm fine, thank you, Kalinda.
Alicia, did you knock over a cheese and wine store?
What's the point in having power
if you can't use it?
Time to negotiate?
Yeah, let's go see what they're offering.
Well, with David Lee involved,
I think I know.
$350,000.
Really, David?
Yes, if you agree to these terms,
we can cut a check today.
Alicia's capital contribution alone
is worth half a million.
Yes, and as Alicia is well aware,
we have had to pay
for significant capital improvements
upon assuming these offices,
all of which falls on the partners.
We want this to be a dignified exit.
We all do.
And yet here we are,
$300,000 short of dignified.
We're all family here,
but our cash reserves have been depleted.
Surely Alicia knows that
we were bruised by the loss of Chumhum.
Yes, and because of the loss of Chumhum,
client retention is even more critical.
Which is why I am assuring all my clients
that they're in good hands.
We have a deposition now.
Why don't we all think about it
and get back together later in the day?
Just so long as we know
that Alicia needs $300,000 more to be happy.
Okay.
We have her over a barrel.
Now that she's an SA,
she has to divest her financial interests immediately.
So we stick with the lowball.
No-- if we piss her off,
we put all our future criminal cases at risk.
No, Alicia's no Castro.
She wouldn't let this hurt our clients.
Come on, she deserves the money--
she built this firm.
And abandoned it.
Uh, then we bump it up another hundred thousand.
I can agree to that.
God, great negotiating stance, Julius.
Did you learn that in New York?
We have a deposition.
Shh... let's not fight.
Wharfmaster began as a labor of love.
Sharing software in development has always been difficult
because of the size of the files.
That's why peer-to-peer sites were created.
So the average user of Wharfmaster
is an entrepreneurial programmer
looking to share his latest creation?
I, uh, have a novel idea.
How about we tone down the
snark and keep this civil?
I don't know about average,
but, yes, programmers are our biggest client base.
And yet 80% of Wharfmaster's traffic
comes from copyrighted music and films.
Uh, nice parsing of numbers, Mr. Agos.
That 80% reflects the number of downloads, not traffic.
And yet our client's movie was downloaded four million times
on your site before it opened in theaters.
4.2 million.
4.2 million times.
So when it finally premiered, the box office was depressed.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dalton,
but I saw In Brain when it opened,
and the box office was depressed
because the movie wasn't very good.
Well, thanks for the review, jackass. Listen,
why don't you stop encouraging people to illegally download?
And then maybe you wouldn't find yourself
in this situation.
Gentlemen, please.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that there are illegal downloads.
I really am, but I'm like the post office.
People pick up and drop off letters and parcels.
I can't control if some of that activity is illegal.
Because I'm not looking inside of the parcels.
So, Mr. Bacevich, you and your employees have
no specific knowledge of any illegal downloading?
Is that correct?
That's correct.
Good. One second.
We're in trouble now.
What is this?
I'm on hold with the Wharfmaster help line.
Is this really necessary?
Welcome to Wharfmaster.
My name is Rami, how can I help you?
Hi, Rami.
I'm having some trouble downloading a file.
Okay, what kind of file?
It's the movie American Sniper.
Oh, come on...
Okay, how big is the file?
It's about 700 megabytes.
Are you using a VPN connection when you connect to Wharfmaster?
There it goes, it started to download.
Thank you so much for your help.
No problem, have a nice day.
Your client claimed that neither he nor anyone at Wharfmaster
has specific knowledge of illegal downloading.
And yet here is his help desk
being helpful illegally downloading a movie.
So shall we discuss a number?
Mrs. State's Attorney...
Mr. Redmayne.
Look at how she basks in her power, Crystal.
Huh? I know that look.
Now get over here.
Get over here, come on.
Okay.
Oh, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes...
This is my assistant,
this is a great...
my personal assistant, Marissa.
Executive assistant.
Yeah, all right, well, look at all this crap.
What did we send over, Crystal?
A chess board.
Uh, made out of human teeth.
Well, anyway, can I sit over there?
Oh, please.
Thank you.
Is it really made out of human teeth?
So I thought I'd get together with you
to talk before the crowds descended on you,
you know what I mean?
Everybody with their hands outstretched.
"Me, me, me, me!"
We're fine here.
Why don't you, uh, sit here next to me?
Um, no, I'm fine.
Oh, I know you are,
but I-I want you to sit near me.
Please.
Pretty please.
Ah, good. Good, good, good.
Now, I started out in sales, shoe sales.
Did I ever tell you that, Crystal?
And there you have to look into the customer's eyes.
And-and that's the way you know whether you've made a sale or not.
Is there something you want to sell me, Mr. Redmayne?
I love women's feet.
You can always tell a woman's taste from her feet.
There's this whore in Arizona,
what was her name, Crystal?
She had the most elegant little feet.
Would you like a muffin?
Brittney.
Yeah, cute little piece of ass.
And she could do the most amazing things with her feet.
And your feet are like hers.
Is there something you need, uh, Mr. Redmayne?
Well, yeah, I want you to appoint Dean Lumber as your major deputy.
Why?
I've known him 20 years.
He's a hell of a guy, he's a hell of a lawyer.
He'd be good for your office here.
Uh, Crystal?
Set up a meeting with Dean.
Uh, no.
Well, have your secretary do it.
I don't care.
No, thank you.
I'm going in another direction.
Uh, now, look,
I know you're new to this office,
so I'll cut you a little slack.
But I spent a lot of zeros to help you get elected.
And I appreciate your contribution.
I don't want your appreciation.
I want you to appoint Dean as your number two man.
Okay, well, I'm so glad you stopped by, Mr. Redmayne.
My, my, my. I-I spent seven figures...
putting you into office.
It won't cost me nearly as much to get you out of it.
Hello, Mrs. Florrick.
Oh, aha, another suitor.
My, my Goodness.
I should have known.
It's always the colored guys.
Excuse me?
No, no, don't worry about it.
I-I'm on your side, you got it?
I gave enough to the Negro College Fund
to give the whole friggin' Congo a scholarship.
Let's go, doll. You know, this, um,
this may seem like power to you, but it isn't.
You give me 20 hours,
I'll show you power.
Excuse me.
Who the hell was that?
Shall we close the door?
No, that's not necessary.
For my benefit, then.
I'll get it.
It was a close race.
It was.
Well, congratulations.
Thank you.
I want to talk about my future.
And yours.
I'm ready to leave the business.
You are?
My son is at the age now
where I want to devote more time to him.
Good.
Smart.
But I'll need your help.
With your son?
Uh, no.
With my transition.
Out of the business.
Do you want me to leave?
No.
It might make things smoother.
No, I think it's better if Marissa stays.
I've noticed what happens
when people of my stature leave the business.
They lose their power, and they either...
become imprisoned or deceased.
I can prevent the latter.
I need your help in preventing the former.
What help?
I need you to stop Geneva Pine's investigation.
What investigation?
Into me.
I suggest this, Mr. Bishop,
I will cheerfully quash the investigation into you
and offer you a full grant of immunity
in trade for your testimony against your lieutenants.
You know I would never do that.
You're turning over a new leaf.
For your son.
I funded your PAC.
I started your PAC.
I kept it going...
I never asked you to.
Please extend me the courtesy of not interrupting.
I spent $1 million on your campaign.
That's a lot of money.
I don't expect to be treated like the hired help.
Mr. Bishop, I'm not treating you...
I'll go public.
About my support.
You can, but the campaign laws also protect me.
I can't coordinate with my PAC.
This was not a smart move.
This was not a smart move at all.
All right, where were we?
Uh, you were asking my client for $28 million.
Which I said wasn't an offer.
It was a punch line.
Your contention is
that the market for your movie In Brain was strangled
by the downloads of said film.
The illegal downloads.
Uh, you are aware
that In Brain, uh, was released
on, uh, Wharfmaster on February 3 of this year?
I am, two days before it opened in theaters.
That's why I'm suing you.
And do you know who uploaded it?
Probably some hacker in his mother's basement.
No, it was you.
Excuse me?
This file was uploaded by Gemstone Publicity,
one of your contractors. As you can see,
the, uh, digital code is identical.
Come on, Gemstone's got nothing to do with us.
They're a PR company that we hired to do viral marketing.
To build buzz for the movie.
And part of that "Buzz" was on Wharfmaster.
Right, um, why don't we take a moment here?
What the hell are you doing?
Uh, thank you, Pastor Jeremiah.
No, no, no.
I appreciate it.
Okay.
Good, good-bye.
You were saying?
What the hell are you doing?
Hi, Dad.
Oh, don't "Hi, Dad" Me.
You're supposed to be keeping her in line.
Eli, can you give me a subject, please?
Anything?
Guy Redmayne-- he just called me.
You mean the man, Guy Redmayne, who came in here
and pressed his groin against me,
compared my feet to those of an Arizona prostitute,
and then demanded that I hire a deputy SA of his choosing?
Yes, him. So?
So I told him no.
I told him it was my choice.
And, yes, his money got me elected,
but that didn't make me his servant.
Ugh, dear God, of course it didn't make you his servant.
Yeah, and that's what I told him.
Alicia, I have spent a long time being your confidant and friend.
We have disagreed on many things,
but I have always respected you, always, until now.
Eli.
I won't be like Peter.
Then don't be.
Of course you're gonna make your own decision,
of course you're not gonna do what Redmayne asks,
but you don't tell him that.
You don't tell him the truth.
No, shut up.
Listen to me.
You know the truth.
Here, in your heart.
Good, be a Disney princess,
but don't tell moneymen like Redmayne anything
but what they want to hear.
Even if it's a lie?
Yes, because it won't be a lie
when you tell it.
Absence of yes times time equals no.
That's the law.
If you're in doubt, you don't say no,
you say, "Thank you for your advice.
All options are open to me.
I plan to decide in the next 48 hours."
Well, what happens in 48 hours?
You do whatever you like, or you delay again,
but you never, ever say no, because anything could happen.
Redmayne will get just as angry if she delays.
No, he won't.
Men like him don't want you to say yes,
they want you to say, "I'm listening."
They want to be able to tell their friends,
"I have the ear of the SA. She listens to me."
He's rich, he's forgetful.
Alicia, look at me!
I know of which I speak, and you don't.
And you don't either.
So what do I do?
I bring Redmayne back in here, and you kiss his ass.
And you shut the hell up.
Okay?
Do what you have to do.
He's right about unclean hands.
Our clients created the problem for which he is suing.
Hmm, so what are we supposed to argue?
Our client only wanted his copyright infringed a little?
No, we pivot.
Trademark Tarnishment?
Are you kidding me?
No, sir.
We're not arguing copyright infringement,
which is, as you know, hard to win.
We are arguing that you tarn...
I'm not sure how you can win that.
Uh, In Brain was released in 4K,
the highest resolution possible.
Kalinda.
Oh, here we go.
Superwoman is back.
I'm now searching for In Brain, and...
...the banner ads-- they're hard-core porn.
Oh, come on.
Mr. Dalton, are you careful where you advertise your movie?
Very careful.
You would never associate
with a porn site like...
"Teenagers and Hounds"?
No, one is very careful with one's brand.
I see.
One might even call this... trademark tarnishment.
Mr. Redmayne, you had some advice
you wanted to share with Alicia.
Uh, I did, but I don't think she wants to hear it.
Oh, she does, Alicia's just a little thrown
by all the changes in her circumstances, aren't you?
Yes, I'm sorry, Mr. Redmayne.
I was trying to get my bearings here,
and I'm, uh, afraid I came across more boldly
than I wanted to.
I don't think I understand.
Well, what Alicia means is...
No, I know what you think she means.
I want to hear what she thinks she means.
I want to hear your advice, Mr. Redmayne.
All options...
are open to me as SA.
And, uh, I will decide
what to do in the next 48 hours.
Guy.
Guy.
Uh, what do you think, Crystal?
Is this a bad penny?
Guy, you wanted
a welcome ear in the SA's office, well, Alicia is it.
You like Taylor Swift?
Excuse me?
Taylor Swift, you know, "Shake That Thing."
Uh, what is it?
"Shake It Off."
"Sh-Shake It Off," Right.
"Shake It Off," I love that song.
Do you?
Do I?
Uh, do I?
Yes.
The current SA, what's his name?
Castro.
Yeah, Castro. Right.
He's been looking into some real estate deals
of mine in Jefferson Park.
It's nothing more than a shakedown.
But I'd like to be relieved of the-the tension.
Well, all options are open to me, Guy.
I like that.
Eli, you're a man of great depth.
I've always told you that, sir.
Yeah, now I'm a believer.
Praise Jesus.
I'll be seeing you, Alicia.
Give me a hug.
Come on.
We can...
I have to say I was surprised by the invitation to come back.
Well, Alicia called me
and said she wasn't thrilled
with the way she left it.
I probably spoke too soon about your chief deputy.
And some other issues.
I'm so glad to hear it.
All options are open to me,
and I plan to decide in 48 hours.
Web sites?
Yes, what sort of Web sites do you search
when you surf the Web, Ms. Sharma?
I do research for the firm,
track down witnesses.
Case work.
You surf a lot of porn, Ms. Sharma?
No.
Uh, you are under oath, ma'am.
Oh, I'm not married.
You don't need to address me as ma'am.
Thanks-- you surf a lot of porn, Mademoiselle?
No.
Ms. Sharma, whose computer did you use?
I.
So this is your laptop?
Well, I use it.
I use it only when I don't want
to use the one that's on my desk.
And do you surf a lot of porn, sir?
Well, define "Surf."
What does this have to do with trademark tarnishment?
Wharfmaster's ads are targeted.
Advertisers track a user's online behavior
and tailor ads to them.
The only people who see ads for pornography
are people who like it.
Wait a minute, I don't like pornography.
I just, you know...
I get targeted, I just get targeted.
Oh, uh, why don't we take a break here?
We can bump it up $50,000.
You're serious.
$50,000 bump for Alicia's exit package.
Yes.
You see, we're ten feet apart, and you offer an inch.
I wish we were in a better position to offer more.
Problem is, we don't have any leverage.
They know that you need to divest now.
No, the problem is Cary's pissed at me.
I can maybe get him to eke out another $75,000.
I'll have two kids in college.
An SA's salary will never cover that.
Let me mull it over a little.
Think of another angle.
Finn.
Yeah?
How would you feel about being my number two
in the SA's office?
What?
You know the job better than I do.
And...
we work well together.
Look, I'm flattered, but...
But what?
I don't know.
Well, think about it.
I will.
Thanks to you and the Lakeshore Women's Group, Mrs. Riggin,
for the wine.
Right, I meant biscotti.
Mom?
Yes, okay. Hope to see you soon. Thank you.
What's wrong?
I was Googling coverage of your election win.
Oh, don't read any of it. Some of it will be nasty.
No, there was a hit on this site called Legal Scholar Today.
It's like, um, like a Gawker for the legal world.
They posted E-mails from your firm.
From my... What E-mails?
Oh, my God.
This one's from today.
D. Lockhart To: C. Agos.
Subject:Alicia's exit package."
Oh, my God!
"Alicia has full plate. String out negotiations best strategy.
Let's frustrate into accepting initial offer."
How much of this is there?
A lot. Like, a lot a lot.
Somebody must've hacked your system.
Are there any from me?
Oh. Oh, oh, this is wonderful.
Cary Agos to Carey Zepps.
"Fourth consecutive case Diane refuses to settle.
Clearly a senior moment.
Need to loosen her up."
"Maybe we can ask McVeigh to do a better job in the sack,
get the stick out of her ass."
Who wrote that? David Lee?
Cary.
Uh, did you see the one from January 8?
"Julius is coming back from New York.
Great, more affirmative action bs."
"Did you see what she wore?
Ten bucks says she's noisy."
Who is that?
Carey Zepps.
He thinks we're sleeping with each other.
And you apparently called David Lee a racist fruitcake.
What? When?
I mean, I know he is, but...
I don't remember writing that.
Well, that's nothing compared to Kalinda.
So you performed oral sex on Howard Lyman in a supply closet?
What?
That's... That's what he's saying.
He's saying, "Good lay. Real firecracker."
"The good Mr. Lee has done Gilbert and Sullivan.
The question is, has he done Gilbert or Sullivan?"
Or try this one. Diane replying to David Lee:
"Cary good lawyer, not great lawyer.
Going to prison not total loss for us."
You're kidding.
All right, is everyone here? Ladies and gentlemen.
Quiet.
Go ahead.
Okay.
I've disconnected your computers from the network. No E-mails.
Oh, are you kidding?
What?
If you need to write something,
do it on paper. Now, uh, yeah.
I'm gonna need all your cell phones.
I need cell phones.
I want to tell everyone here...
Quiet.
Shut up in back!
There seems to be a misunderstanding here
that I am gay.
I am not gay.
I am dating a woman, in fact.
And I will sue anyone here...
Who suggests that I was hired because of affirmative action.
That's what you people always do.
David, come on.
We people? Have you noticed you're surrounded
by rich people?
Listen to you, huh?
That's what you people always do.
Okay, all right...
And I do not pick my nose during client meetings.
Tell it to the disgusted clients.
I have a deviated septum, all right?
Things get caught up there but I do not bring them to the meeting.
Calm down, let's calm down. Come on.
We all said things that we didn't mean.
Even things, Diane, that we should take back.
What, like removing a stick from my ass?
Excuse me, you said I wasn't much of a lawyer.
Everyone, let's just calm down.
Every single partner had their E-mails hacked except you.
How is that possible?
Because they only released them from the last four months.
I was using my campaign E-mail.
Wow. Lucky.
The recriminations stop now.
Everyone wrote things in those E-mails that they clearly regret.
Yes, and things that weren't true... Howard.
What? You and I were in the supply closet.
What? No, we weren't. What planet are you living on?
Stop. Stop!
We need to focus on our cases
or there will be a mass exodus of clients.
Kalinda?
Okay, odds are this is a Hacker's Reaction to
the Wharfmaster case.
I mean, Nathan Bacevich is a hero in the cyber world.
Do we think this is Anonymous?
I don't know. I mean, they usually announce themselves,
but let me see what I can dig up,
but this one's not gonna be easy.
I want an update every 30 minutes.
Let's get back to work.
And remember: normalcy.
After you, my dear.
You and I are gonna have a serious chat.
Oh, wait.
I got an E-mail.
What is it?
From E.E.-- no other name.
"This is just the first batch.
Tomorrow, we will release two years of E-mails."
Two years?
Yes.
Does Kalinda have any idea who's doing this?
No.
But...
it's because of the illegal download case, right?
I can explain that!
Break it up. Break it... Stop it!
Get out of here. What the hell is wrong with you?
It's like a pirate ship here.
Do you have any problems over the last two years?
Yes.
Yeah, me, too.
And just to warn you, I probably said some things
when we were arguing at the firm.
Same here.
Let's agree:
you see any E-mails from me about you, delete it.
Yes.
And you, too.
Agreed.
Good.
What a nightmare.
I need you to do me a favor.
Sure. What, shoot you now?
Take my laptop,
go through all my E-mails from the last two years
and find out what I said.
That's a lot of E-mails.
Can I do a word search?
Sure.
With what?
Anything with Will or...
Elfman?
No, that wouldn't be on my work E-mail.
Bishop.
Really?
Not sexual. Business.
And Peter. Anything with Peter. Not just his...
Tell me it's not true.
It's okay,
we're on top of it.
On top of what?
The E-mails.
Wait, what are you talking about?
Finn Polmar. Tell me you did not ask him to be your number two.
And that's my cue.
He would make an excellent deputy.
And how did you even hear?
Don't you get it?
When to say yes is just as important as when to say no.
Wait, what are you talking about? What E-mail?
Nothig. It's something here.
Alicia, you offered Finn the job
because you like him and he's maybe even a good lawyer,
but he doesn't do anything important for you.
You mean he doesn't do anything important for you.
Next time say it to my face, jackass.
Oh, but I have said it to your face, Branch,
I have said it to your face.
Stupid son of a bitch.
Everything all right here?
It's a long story.
Giving Finn the job will be seen as a slap in the face
by every senior attorney in your office who was passed over.
Every woman. Every...
African-American.
Where are you going?
Out.
I'm a superstar, Kalinda, uh,
but one thing I can't do is track a hack back to a hacker.
Okay, but you can identify the I.P. addresses they're using.
Sure, but they're just false fronts.
They bounce around a thousand different servers,
and every one of them is anonymized.
So there's nothing we can do?
This is a hacker chat room. Read some of these messages.
"This law firm needs to be punished!"
"Time for some A.P.T."?
Advanced Persistent Threat.
Oh.
"Dox-p, anyone?"
Right.The thing is, there's no way to know
if this is all just angry talk,
or if any of this is real.
Or maybe there is.
What they're doing to me is a blow against freedom for all of us.
Today it's Wharfmaster. Tomorrow, who knows?
Nathan was complaining, not stirring anything up.
I believe it's called free speech.
It's called intimidation.
Your client incited hackers to attack us
to get us to back off.
You know, we could settle this right now
and make all your problems go away.
You have incredible chutzpah, Jared.
No, Diane, I have a winning case.
Well, you and your case can go to hell.
You lived there for a year?
Six months on a Kibbutz, six months in Jerusalem.
What was Israel like? Hot.
Do you think I'd like living there?
No.
'Cause I'm Christian?
No, there are a ton of Christians there,
all with cameras. Because it's hot.
You spent a year living where it all began.
You must have felt, like, I don't know-- inspired.
No, just hot.
And gassy. You eat a lot of falafel.
Marissa's trying to convince me to not live in Israel.
Really?
Hey, Grace, can you give me and Marissa a moment?
Yeah. Just let me know when you want to eat.
Okay.
The E-mails?
Yeah. I went through about 5,000.
How bad?
Well, there's one where you call a donor
"The worst kind of sexist pig-- a pompous sexist pig."
Another where you tell Cary Agos that Finn Polmar
is "Soft and malleable with a spine of cottage cheese."
I was trying to buck Cary up during his trial.
At the bottom is one from your gynecologist.
It's your question about the reliability of pregnancy tests.
I was late.
Hey, I'm just the messenger.
Okay, so...
these aren't good, but they're not overly awful.
Um... those are just the ones I marked questionable.
These are the ones I marked bad.
I highlighted them in red.
This one's from Will Gardner
right after some New York conference.
He talks about you two.
Oh, my God.
Yeah.
And... this one was kind of unexpected.
"Relax. It was just a one-night stand,
albeit a great one." That was from you to Elfman.
But how did this even get in... here?
I... I never wrote Jon from my campaign or my work E-mail.
You probably toggled the wrong account.
It was quaint.
You don't really see "Albeit" in too many E-mails.
What am I gonna do?
Stop these E-mails from getting out there.
How?
Braden v. Campbell-- puntitives for invasion of privacy
stemming from the unauthorized publication of a diary.
So we argue every E-mail hacked is like a diary entry.
No.
You have to settle this.
The firm's reputation can't handle another dump.
The firm's reputation, Ms. State's Attorney?
Your E-mails were noticeably absent
from the first dump, Alicia.
You're going to clean that up!
Our interests are aligned here.
Respectfully, Alicia, our interests have not been aligned
since you used our office as a staging ground for your political career.
Have you read the last two years of E-mails?
This one's from Will to me,
November 12, 2013.
"Alicia, can you meet with Sweeney tomorrow at 3:00?
Our favorite wife-killing psycho has requested your presence."
Diane, this one's from you.
Monday, June 3, 2013.
"Let's huddle about the Connolly billings.
"I want to head that geriatric blimp off at the pass."
Yes.
We need to settle.
Now.
No.
Mr. Dalton, $500,000
at least gives you something.
It's a drop in the bucket for Wharfmaster.
I want that arrogant son of a bitch out of business.
Well, then at this time,
we need to notify you that we are withdrawing as your counsel.
What? Given the damage
we've already incurred from that hack,
we can't continue in an effective capacity.
But we can refer you to a number of excellent law firms.
You think a single one
would take me on after what happened to you?
We're stuck with each other, Ms. Lockhart.
Mr. Dalton, our firm is undergoing a catas...
No. Listen, you undertook an obligation to represent me.
Now, you're going to fulfill it.
Or we can ask the judge what he thinks.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my...
Eli.
Would you please stop saying that?
Phone sex?
It was two years ago.
Question is, what do we do, Dad?
These aren't out yet?
No, the threat is that they'll get dumped today,
and the question is, do I apologize
to people beforehand?
No.
Never apologize beforehand.
You never know what's gonna happen.
I disagree.
Well, bully for you.
When you have more than four months' experience,
come back and we'll listen.
In the real world, where real people live,
not politicians, there's something to be said
for preparing a client to hear that you called them
an "Arrogant, sweaty misanthrope."
You put that in an E-mail?
Look, it's a corollary to the never-say-no principle.
Always best to do nothing when you don't have to do anything.
It shows consideration.
It shows weakness.
And most importantly, it may not happen.
Excuse me.
No. No. Whatever you're gonna do, no.
I'm sorry.
What for?
For an E-mail i sent about you.
What E-mail?
I said you were soft... and malleable,
with a spine like cottage cheese.
Cottage cheese?
It was during Cary's trial,
when everything was getting crazy.
And did you believe it?
No. No. Alicia, if you're looking
to rescind the offer to be your chief deputy...- What?
No. I mean, this whole thing is... it...
Of course the offer still stands.
Okay, then.
Bygones.
Really?
Sure.
Mr. Bishop.
Hello.
I think we got off on the wrong foot.
Shall we go up to my office?
No. Here's fine.
You're probably right
about the PAC information not hurting you.
Let's go upstairs.
No.
But I did give my captains walking-around money
to get the vote out in the African-American communities.
You know, the communities where you were weak.
I didn't ask you to do that, sir.
It gets a bit confusing about who asked who to do what.
That's my impression, anyway.
So maybe you should think about
the Geneva Pine investigation.
Okay?
Thank you for your thoughts, Mr. Bishop.
All options are open to me,
and I plan to decide in the next 48 hours.
Good. Then I'll sit tight and wait to hear from you.
I appreciate your openness.
You know, I sense something between us.
Want to grab some dinner one night? Huh?
Please tell me you've made some headway on these hackers.
No, but I may have found something on Nathan Bacevich.
Remember he said that he saw In Brain when it first came out?
Yes, and wasn't impressed.
Yeah. But it was only in the U.S. Theaters
from February 5 through March 6.
Bacevich was in Europe promoting Wharfmaster.
So where did he watch it?
You used your own site to download it, illegally,
despite your repeated denials
that you and your web site knowingly violated
copyright infringement laws.
Congratulations, Mr. Bacevich.
You lied under oath and can now be prosecuted for perjury.
We have enough to win this, Nathan,
and your attorney knows that.
And if we press the perjury charge,
you could go to prison.
We will go as low as $15 million.
Here's the only deal we'll agree to.
An apology...
from Mr. Dalton
for bringing a frivolous lawsuit to Mr. Bacevich.
What the hell?
Excuse me?
I'm sorry, are we in upside-down land here?
No, sir.
We are very much right-side up,
and the view is very clear.
You have two hours, or the deal is off the table.
This is disgusting! It's the triumph of the anarchists.
No, it isn't.
You know, the next killer app
isn't coming from some corporate office in Seattle or San Jose,
it's coming from some 16-year-old in Warsaw
who gets excited by a 14-year-old's code in Mumbai.
You obsess so much about copyright and DRMs,
you're missing what's great about what's going on.
You're building fences, and we're trying to tear them all down,
not because we hate you,
but because we're trying to build the next big thing.
Let us do it.
Because it's gonna happen either way.
Take the deal.
Um, excuse me?
We are winning this, sir.
No, we're not.
My company's E-mails were just hacked, too.
Take... the deal.
If the hacker or hackers
was looking to rain a little havoc on us...
they sure succeeded.
Wildly.
So...
...I think an apology's in order.
From whom to whom?
Take your pick.
I was blowing off steam.
Yes, you were pigheaded,
belligerent, and arrogant to the extreme...
but you're, uh...
you're also a hell of a lawyer.
A fruitcake?
We settled the Wharfmaster case.
Thank you.
Yeah. Let the bad guys win.
Well, it was the only move, which means it was the smart move.
It's not a pretty picture
when you see what people really think of you.
I don't think it is, really, what people think of you.
I think sometimes you just have to...
let off steam, say something nasty.
And sometimes the nasty thing is what people really think.
Sometimes.
Is this a joke?
$100,000 total? That is a quarter million
below your initial offer.
This hack has been a game changer.
We have to buy a whole new computer network and E-mail system.
Not to mention new laptops, cell phones, iPads.
There's nothing more to give.
Alicia...
you should take it.
I'll consider it.
And I want you all to know...
that this offer does not in any way
impact my consideration of your criminal cases
when I'm SA.
Was that a thinly veiled threat?
Nope. Very clear one.
She wouldn't dare.
You want to chance it?
So, are you safe?
For the moment, yes.
And Redmayne and Castro are satisfied?
Happy days.
So, what did we learn?
Hell if I know.
Go slow, choose carefully.
Right.
Do you know Neil Sands?
Do I... No.
He's a lawyer over at Justice.
African-American.
Dad was a cop. He is by all accounts a topnotch attorney.
He'd be a great number two.
What do you think?
Thank you for your advice, Eli.
All options are open to me,
and I plan to decide in 48 hours.
