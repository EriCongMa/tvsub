as you can probably gather .
how you doing hey .

thank you . thank you .
jason &apos;s a big contemporary art enthusiast .
well , we &apos;re exhibiting 4 up @-@ and @-@ coming artists in this show
everything &apos;s for sale ,
and i can definitely swing a nice discount for a friend .
lila .
hey .
guys , come on .
do i look 12 years old to you
14 .
spencer , i &apos;d like you to meet a real movie star .
movie star please .
she has a supporting role on a television series about beach volleyball .
totally blue @-@ collar .
i &apos;m lila .
hi . i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m doctor spencer reid .
uh--i &apos;m spencer .
you don &apos;t have to ... call me doctor .
i won &apos;t .
excuse me . hey ! i told you !
no photos in the gallery !
out !
and who are you
i &apos;m jason gideon . i &apos;m a friend of--
have you seen my work
no .
thanks .
so , you &apos;re not from around here , are you
me no . no . i &apos;m , uh ...
we &apos;re running a training service about profiling
for the los angeles police department .
profiling
yeah , i &apos;m with the behavioral analysis unit of the fbi .
we psychoanalyze crime scenes
in order to gain a better understanding
of the criminal who might have committed the crime .
psychoanalyze , huh
are you doing that to me right now
what no .
i &apos;m not psychoanalyzing you .
spencer , i &apos;m kidding .
one of my earliest works .
totally boring .
oh , i don &apos;t think so .
nothing &apos;s just a picture .
if viewed correctly-- whatever that means--
one can see world views , obsessions ,
manifestations of the subconscious .
if i weren &apos;t a lesbian ,
i &apos;d jump your bones .
i &apos;ve always had this thing for middle @-@ aged men .
you have these piercing , discerning eyes
which remind me of my father who was a shrink .
and i &apos;m like , god , i am so hot .
parker : pinky , some guy from artnews wants to talk to you .
don &apos;t go away .
does it make you feel anything
like what
i can &apos;t tell you how to feel .
right now , i feel pretty good .
we &apos;re leaving .
we &apos;re still looking at the exhibit .
now .
now . now .
yeah , i guess we &apos;re leaving .
reid , now . nice to meet you .
on the way . bye , spencer .
sorry .
today , we thought we &apos;d focus on what is probably
the most important component of profiling ,
or for that matter , any investigative technique :
victimology .
the word victim stems from the latin word victima
which means &quot; sacrifice . &quot;
no , i can &apos;t go to the gym .
i &apos;m waiting for my shooting script .
i think it just came .
uh , yeah . ok .
i &apos;ll see you at the gym , babe , bye .
reid : victims of violent crimes
are brutalized by a subject
to decide life and death er a fellow human being .
hi .
are you gonna give it to me
aah !
there are around 16 million people in the l.a metropolitan area .
every time a person is killed , robbed , or raped ,
the most important question you will ask yourself is why
why did your unsub choose this victim--
hello
gideon : at this time .
natalie
gideon : is there anything done
which provoked the criminal to act
or was the target available or weak ,
a causality of circumstance
natalie
natalie .
oh , my god !
oh , my god ! no !
natalie ! no !
oh , my god !
心 理
第十八集
you know , we really can get ourselves to the airport .
i didn &apos;t invite the fbi here
to let them make their own way around town .
we really appreciate it .
hey , i can &apos;t thank you guys enough
for conducting the seminar .
well , don &apos;t hesitate to call
if there &apos;s anything we can help help with
kim here .
great .
yeah , i &apos;ll be there as soon as i drop the fbi agents at l.a.x.
everything all right
double murder at a hollywood bungalow .
a celebrity .
young movie star natalie ryan and her fianc
apparently shot to death .
it &apos;s gonna be a major pain in the ass .
you guys care to take a quick look
before i drive you to the aport
it &apos;s on the way .
absolutely .
no sign of forced entry .
gideon : same weapon .
reid : the girl was shot execution style .
once in the head .
the male 3 times in the torso .
so you have 2 different m.o.s.
we have an image on the video surveillance camera .
looks like a messenger of some kind wearing a motorcycle helmet .
he &apos;s unidentifiable .
there &apos;s no sign of struggle
between the girl and the unsub from the door to the couch .
he most likely forced her at gunpoint .
he told her to trust him .
&quot; do what i say . i won &apos;t hurt you . &quot;
fatal mistake .
mm @-@ hmm . he asked her to sit on the couch
and then shot her in the head .
the fiancwasn &apos;t expected .
his killing &apos;s messier .
it &apos;s less controlled . it &apos;s less organized .
what do you think
i &apos;ve had a couple other cases recently .
past few months .
same type of weapon , .22 caliber handgun .
both shot in the head .
the first was an established film producer , wally melman .
and the second was chloe harris ,
another young actress ...
but not as well known as natalie here .
any forensic evidence
no . and the guys have been going through this place all morning
and haven &apos;t come up with anything .
so he clearly knows how to cover his tracks .
like a professional hit man
maybe .
gideon ,
there are people actually taking photographs of us from the next yard .
welcome to l.a.
.22 &apos;s are small but efficient .
they bounce around inside a person like a pinball .
preferred weapon of the mafia .
you know , there &apos;s no obvious sexual component to these crimes
which is usually the case with serial murders .
so are are thinking this is a serial killer
well , it &apos;s certainly a series of murders .
we don &apos;t know enough yet to call them serial .
would you consider hanging out in l.a. a little while ,
let me leaon your exptise
until we do figure out what we &apos;ve got
yeah . just cancelled our flights .
we &apos;ll have the rest of our team out here asap .
morgan : first 2 victims :
wally melman and chloe harris .
both killed in public places .
chloe was lled while walking her dog
on the beach in santa monica
which she did every morning .
and wally was killed outside of a massage parlor .
in culver city .
which he went to every tuesday .
well , if he knows their schedules ,
maybe that means he follows his victims for a while .
and not a single witness .
so we know this unsub can blend in .
regardless of the location ,
he has the ability to hide in plain sht .
he &apos;s meticulous .
the media &apos;s calling natalie ryan &apos;s murder
the biggest celebrity homicide since sharon tate .
what does that mean for us
that everybody will be watching
this guy is an assassin
when you look at the victimolgy ,
there &apos;s no obvious links .
all the kills are clean
except in the instance of the last victim , jeremy collins .
there &apos;s absolutely no evidence left at the crime scene .
there &apos;s no dna ,
no manifestation of psycho @-@ sexual release ,
and there &apos;s no detectable signature of any kind .
remember , our profiles are formulated
not just by what &apos;s present at the scene ,
but also what &apos;s absent .
from all the evidence that we &apos;ve gathered ,
we believe that yore looking for a type @-@ 4 assassin .
type 4
type one &apos;s are political assassins ,
like john wilkes booth .
type 2 &apos;s are egocentrics
looking for simple recognition
type 3 &apos;s are psychopaths ,
cold @-@ blooded killers who leave far messier scenes .
and type 4 , our unsub ,
suffers from a major mental disorder
and is frequently delusional .
the closer we come to figuring out that delusion ,
the closer we &apos;ll get to finding the unsub .
what &apos;s he going to be doing until we do
finding other victims .
excuse me .
hi . is there a detective kim here
right here .
you &apos;re heading the investigation
into t natalie ryan murder
yes . um ...
my--i have a client . she &apos;s , uh ...
is there another place we can be private
we &apos;re all working this murder .
well , um ...
she received a note , my client did ,
and she freaked out .
i told her not to worry about it .
where is the note
where &apos;s your client
she &apos;s waiting in the other room .
reid , let &apos;s go .
lila .
hi .
hotch : how well did you know natalie ryan
we spoke when we saw each other in public ,
but we were never friends .
how about wally melman
what
wally melman .
he &apos;s a producer who was killed
a couple months ago .
the paper said that was a robbery
the paper was wrong .
did you know him
we met a few times about a project , but ...
i didn &apos;t get the part .
they went a different way .
which way
he cast , um , another act .
oh , my god .
what is it
he cast natalie ryan .
&quot; you owe me . &quot;
i guess that &apos;s one way to ice out the competition .
don &apos;t look at me .
i brought her to the police station .
have you ever had a sense that someone is watching you ,
following you
from the moment i get to work ,
i have hair and make @-@ up and wardrobe people ,
producers , writers , my agent , my manager , publicist .
not to mention the photographers .
it &apos;s part of the life .
anything seem out of the ordinary
happens on a regular basis or semi @-@ regular basis
what do you mean
repetitive phone calls with hang ups .
gifts left anonymously .
i receive flowers on the seventh of each month .
they just appear in my trailer .
never a note . just a plain glass bowl .
red anemones .
my favorite .
and u don &apos;t want to know who they &apos;re from
celebrities get anonymous gifts all the time .
she has fans , you know .
you remember meeting anyone on the seventh day of the month
or in july , the seventh month of the year
no .
wally melman was a producer
who considered hiring you , but didn &apos;t .
and natalie was a rival .
and chloe harris she looks a lot like you ,
don &apos;t you think
who
a potential rival .
she was murdered , too .
so all these ...
people are being killed because of me
it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sorry ...
i can &apos;t . i--i have to go .
lila !
lila .
lila .
what &apos;s happening , spencer
it &apos;s still rather speculative ,
but it appears there &apos;s a delusional assassin
who &apos;s killing people to help further your career .
it probably started as a stalker .
an erotomanic stalker .
there &apos;s a psychopathology of the evolution
of these types of stalkers .
and the fact that he &apos;s contacting you indicates that
he believe you own him something
this model frequently concludes itself to one of 2 possibilities :
either thetalker will kill himself ,
or he &apos;ll kill the object of his affection .
hotch : with this unsub ,
we &apos;re looking at a compound profile :
a type @-@ 4 delusional assassin
with an erotomanic fixation on the actress lila archer .
erotomanics are a form of stalker
who posses the delusional belief that another person ,
usually of a higher social status ,
is in love with them .
in the united states , at any given time ,
there are over 200,000 people being stalked .
our unsub is having a fantasy love affair with lila archer
the way john hinkley did with jodie foster .
ms. archer was not aware of her stalker until yesterday .
he wasn &apos;t trying to impress her .
he was more like an unwanted , very violent guardian angel .
when the stalk feels as if they &apos;ve been
in some way betrayed by their love object ,
this often leads to violence against the target .
reid : in the case of john robert bardo
when actress rebecca schaeffer
took a role where she had to have
a sexual relationship with another character ,
it was enough to force him to snap
and seek her out to kill her .
though stalkers can be either male or female ,
it &apos;s most likely we &apos;re looking for a single male ,
a loner , in his late twenties to early forties ,
very intelligent , with ample time to follow his victim
and study her habits .
as of yet , the unsub has not directed
any violence towards ms . archer .
but he has shifted his focus
from those around her to her directly .
is doesn &apos;t preclude the fact
that anyone who has the vaguest association with ms . archer
is a potential target .
i love you . you &apos;re my favorite client .
no .
i haven &apos;t asked you anything yet .
i &apos;m not stopping my life .
you can stay with me . no .
a hotel just until the police say you &apos;re safe
michael--
you know i worry .
good @-@ bye , michael .
ok . call me ... lots . kisses .
hello . good @-@ bye .
i &apos;m leaving .
hey , mags .
he &apos;s an odd guy .
yeah , but who isn &apos;t a little odd out here
well , that &apos;s for sure .
look , we &apos;re ready to rehearse scene 43 and ...
this was taped to your trailer door .
thanks , hon .
i &apos;m intrigued by this particular version of the verb &quot; to be . &quot;
past participle .
steady state of being . preceding adverb .
&quot; always . &quot; in english
that is english , actually .
we &apos;re discussing the verb tenses-- reid .
our stalker sounds like someone she knows .
reid : based on the tense of the verb .
maybe it &apos;s time to get her off the street .
there &apos;s been no physical threat to her .
she might be safe just staying put
as opposed to anywhere else .
i &apos;m standing right here , guys .
if we did remove you ,
we &apos;d have to take you to an undisclosed location
i &apos;m sure your stalker knows where you live .
i &apos;m not having the whole show close down .
i only need one more scene to shoot .
look , last night i decided
i wasn &apos;t gonna be afraid of this lunatic .
am i safe here
the set &apos;s cleared of everyone
except essential personnel ,
and we have increased security at the gate .
lila , they &apos;re ready for you .
i &apos;m staying at work , gentlemen .
morgan : well , she &apos;s one tough girl .
yeah .
i didn &apos;t want to say anything in front of her ,
but his anger about her going to the police
suggests he might alter his agenda .
morgan : typical for a stalker .
she didn &apos;t go alone to the police .
her manager took her .
you and reid stay here . keep an eye on her .
i &apos;ll hang back , too . where you going
to talk to her manager .
ahem .
sorry if i was , um , insensitive last night .
you were only doing your job , right
yeah .
then there &apos;s no need to apologize .
eww .
you don &apos;t mind sharing with me , do ya
no .
you don &apos;t mind sharing with me , do ya
shut up . go get &apos; em , lover .
elle : hello
hotch : mr . ryer
michael ...
until now , every victim &apos;s a person
who can be perceived as a threat to ms . archer .
yeah , but michael wa a friend .
but he was a threat to the stalker
get lila to a safe house .
reid : she &apos;s still working .
did you meet up with her manager
gideon : reid , take her home , have her pack some things .
what &apos;s going on
we were too late .
she &apos;s gonna beevastated .
i know . jj &apos;s keeping it out of the press for now .
let &apos;s not tell her yet .
not tell her
no , not yet .
we need her to cooperate with us ...
in order to protect her .
i &apos;ll talk to you later .
you gonna take her of the street
i &apos;m gonna completely deny him access .
won &apos;t even give him a glimpse of her .
hopefully , that &apos;ll bring him out of the woodwork .
yeah . no , we &apos;re pulling up right now .
uh @-@ huh . there &apos;s a marked car out front .
yeah .
got it . i &apos;ll check it out .
is everything ok
i just need to run through
some security measures with you .
all right
gideon , you better take a look at these .
morgan , it &apos;s elle .
yeah .
elle : we found a manila envelope on michael ryer &apos;s desk .
it &apos;s full of photos .
ok .
well , they &apos;re candid shots os lila archer nude .
i &apos;m guessing he was probably paying someone off
to keep them out of the press .
do we know who
um , the name on the envelope was joe martinez .
the paparazzo
you know him
yeah , i dealt with him a lot .
elle , we &apos;re on it .
wow .
i like your house .
i rent it .
nice . you should also probably change all your phone numbers .
i &apos;m unlisted .
anytime you call an 800 number or an 888 number ,
your phone number &apos;s put into a databank
that &apos;s been sold to telemarketers .
if someone gets your cell phone number ,
they can go on line and research all your records .
hanging out with you can be really depressing .
uh , you should also probably carry
a piece of paper and a pen with you wherever you go
in case you see any suspicious license plates that often reappear .
photographic collage .
i like it because it &apos;s like life , you know
you know , like obscure , difficult .
you should also get a dog .
uh , like a guard dog of some sort .
allergic .
um , earl grey or chamomile
what what
would you like some tea
yes , yes , sure .
fbi !
martinez .
it &apos;s clear .
see
this guy &apos;s a real scumbag .
you got that right .
what &apos;s this
it &apos;s a call sheet .
it &apos;s a shooting schedule
for a film or television show .
that &apos;s lila &apos;s show .
yeah .
he &apos;s not supposed to have that , is he
no .
hey .
look .
that &apos;s reid .
that &apos;s an old picture .
he a target now
not if i can help it . let &apos;s go .
reid , it &apos;s morgan . listen to me .
you got to watch your back over there .
we just found a bunch of close @-@ up photos of you
at this guy joseph martinez &apos;s studio .
looks like he could be the unsub .
he had a ton of photos of lila and natalie ,
plus a call sheet for lila &apos;s show .
we &apos;re on our way right now ,
but i need you to be real careful until we get there , all right
all right .
you all right
yeah .
just my shoulder .
all right , i &apos;m calling for help .
officer down . we need an ambulance
how we doing
he &apos;ll make it .
caught one in the shoulder
and shattered his collarbone .
you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
no sign of this martinez , a photographer ?
no .
whoever took a shot at you
followed you from the set .
martinez has a bunch of paperwork in his studio
that says where lila &apos;s gonna be everyday .
gideon .
that &apos;s what i thought . thanks .
garcia &apos;s gone through every article written about lila .
she never says anything about red anemones being her favorite flower .
well , we &apos;re looking for someone pretty close to her .
this list gets shorter every day .
he &apos;s circling in . we need to get to her house .
i &apos;ll make sure the press doesn &apos;t get out of hand with this mess .
feel anything yet
there &apos;s something definitely appealing about this one .
it &apos;s a start .
what are you doing
going for a swim .
what no . lila
ahh .
ooh !
lila , you cannot do this .
five minutes .
go get a suit in the house .
what no ! i don &apos;t wanna grab a suit .
are you kidding me no .
join me .
no , i &apos;m not gonna join you .
why not
you &apos;re being pursued by a psychotic killer
who shoots people in the head .
i &apos;m not gonna stop living my life .
i &apos;m just not .
lila , i &apos;m begging of you .
will you please get out of the pool
really , spence , you should live a little .
live a little i &apos;ve known you 48 hours ,
i feel like i &apos;ve already aged 10 years .
i can &apos;t be that band .
yes . no , you are that bad .
fine , can you help me out at least
yes , very funny . laugh it up , lila .
hilarious .
my gun &apos;s wet . great .
my clothes .
you should have worn the suit .
this is completely inappropriate .
this what &apos;s this
this isn &apos;t--
no , there &apos;s this thing called transference .
you don &apos;t like me
what
you don &apos;t like me .
i do like you . i do .
i like you too .
just i &apos;m a federal agent , you know ,
and i &apos;m supposed to protect you .
then keep me close .
i &apos;m just , uh , i &apos;m a little bit worried .
you know , we &apos;re-- we &apos;re in a pool ,
and it &apos;s a--we &apos;re pretty much exposed .
we have cops .
we have cops posted out front .
there are coyotes out back .
and right here it &apos;s just you and me .
i , uh ...
stop . i &apos;m sorry .
i have to , um ,
i have to tell you something .
what
i didn &apos;t want to tell you this before
&apos;cause i was a little bit worried .
i didn &apos;t-- you don &apos;t--
i don &apos;t know how to say it , but i can &apos;t not tell you .
what is it
your manager , michael ...
what
gideon went to check on him ,
but he got there too late .
lila .
how could you--
how could you not tell me
i was afraid you &apos;d be upset .
you ...
you knew what you knew , and--
how could you not--
i &apos;m so sorry .
no , don &apos;t , don &apos;t touch me . don &apos;t touch me .
give me a reason .
well , we found him in the bushes .
i told her she should cut those .
i , uh , fell in .
yeah , and i &apos;m sure there &apos;s plenty of photos of it .
stop shoving me , man .
you &apos;re a suspect in the murder of wally melman , natalie ryan ,
and jeremy collins .
murder what whoa , whoa-- shut up with the whoa .
we know for a fact that you have hundreds of photographs
of lila archer and natalie ryan
on the walls of your studio .
you have miss archer &apos;s daily schedule on your desk .
you &apos;ve been stalking her .
look , guys , look . hold up .
every parazzo &apos;s a celebrity stalker .
if you don &apos;t stalk &apos; em , you don &apos;t get the shot .
if you don &apos;t make the shot , you don &apos;t sell no pictures .
well , this one is gonna cost you .
wha--no . that &apos;s just wrong .

michael was like family .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s just so hard to trust people out here .
you don &apos;t--you don &apos;t know who to believe .
everybody wants something from you .
that &apos;s why i thought you were different .
i know i should have told you .
i told him not to .
he was only following my orders .
you know ...
the last time i was able to fully trust someone
was at julliard .
before i was a somebody .
julliard .
and didn &apos;t you say you used to live on houston street
what
you were a waitress .
you lived on houston . yeah .
i need to take this thing apart .
i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll put it back .

i didn &apos;t make the damn thing .
so you ...
just happened to give her a work of art
that contains most of her life in it
i--no .

if there &apos;s something you aren &apos;t saying ,
now would be a real good time to say it .
all right .
all right , i lied .
what about
i just wanted her to like me .
i met her here . she was a fan of art .
i figured if there was hip , young stars
coming into the gallery , it would help business .
what was the lie
someone gave me the piece to give to her ,
but i told her it was from me .
i said i found it and i thought she &apos;d love it .
and who gave it to you
her name &apos;s maggie lowe .
she , uh , she works on lila &apos;s show .
she said she went to college with li .
she &apos;s like a p.a. or a.d. or some acronym .
she wanted to make sure that lila got the collage ,
but she didn &apos;t want lila to know that she gave it to her .
she said to say that it was from a secret admirer .
but i told her it was from me , so ...
i have a name . maggie lowe .
she &apos;s the unsub . she &apos;s on lila &apos;s show .
we &apos;re on our way .

the hair and makeup people are coming in 10 minutes .

this kind of publicity makes me really uncomfortable .
don &apos;t be ridiculous .
i &apos;m talking about performing a public service , all right
stalking is a major problem in this country .
it &apos;s good , it &apos;s good .
all right , i got to take this .

gideon : bernard shaw once said ,
&quot; an american has no sense of privacy .
&quot; he does not know what it means .
there is no such thing in the country . &quot;
night , hollywood .
come on , man .
you know , reid ,
you &apos;re lucky they didn &apos;t get a shot of you
next to the pool trying to draw your gun .
you looked like a wet rat .
hey .
i was playing .
did you know that , um , she , uh ,
i kissed her in the pool
it &apos;s so weird . it doesn &apos;t even
feel like it really happened , you know
sure , sure .
she &apos;s a beautiful young actress .
yeah , you know , i kept explaining
to her about transference
and the fact that , you know ,
she probably only liked me
because i was there to protect her .
reid .
you were her hero .
i wanted to think that .
no , no , no . don &apos;t go selling yourself srt , kid .
you took down an armed subject
without firing a shot .
you saved her life .
that &apos;s pretty much a hero in my book .
let me ask you this .
have you ever crossed professional boundaries
with a victim of a case you were working on
no .
it &apos;s pretty bad , right
some things you can &apos;t control
even with that big ol &apos; brain of yours .
no harm , no foul .
let it go .
hey , morgan
has there ever been a girl that you wanted to be with
for more than , you know , just one night
excuse me
i &apos;ve never seen you with the same girl twice .
what , are you calling me a dog
no , not at all .
i &apos;m just trying to figure out
if this feeling i have is ever gonna go away .
reid , what we do for a living ,
it takes up all our time .
and a relationship &apos;s hard enough
even in the same city .
so , i mean , you &apos;re saying it &apos;s probably wise
that i don &apos;t call her , right ?
i can &apos;t answer that one for you .
hey , i &apos;ll tell you what i do know .
you don &apos;t need to come up with that answer tonight .
i &apos;m out .
have a good weekend .
yeah , you too , romeo .
