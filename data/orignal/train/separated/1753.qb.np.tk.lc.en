so , what are you working on these days ?
i &apos;m studying one @-@ celled organisms
to try and find the neurochemicals
that lead to the feeling of shame .
what would a one @-@ celled organism have to be embarrassed about ?
same as all of us , getting out of a car without underwear .
speaking of underwear ,
i have some interesting news ...
okay , if it &apos;s sometimes howie wears yours ,
leonard already told us .
he was being funny .
i &apos;m pretty sure .
anyway , i was asked to be a part of a magazine article
about the 50 sexiest female scientists in california .
isn &apos;t that cool ?
i think it &apos;s awful .
why would you say that ?
bernadette is a successful microbiologist .
she should be celebrated for her achievements , not her looks .
i mean , what kind of message does that send ?
i think the message is-- &quot; check out the rack on that scientist . &quot;
why can &apos;t someone be thought of as both smart and pretty ?
i just don &apos;t think a professional woman should have
to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead .
okay , what &apos;s the big deal ?
look , if it helps me make a sale with a physician ,
i don &apos;t think it hurts to flirt a little .
i mean , laugh at their joke , touch their arm ,
maybe crank up the ac in the car beforehand , you know ,
to wake up the girls .
maybe it &apos;s different in the world of sales ,
but it &apos;s already hard enough for women
to be taken seriously in science .
i was kind of excited about the article ,
but now you &apos;re making me feel bad .
no , i think you should do whatever you want .
you know , maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them ,
i would &apos;ve become a theoretical physicist .
stop smirking at each other .
thank you .
no , thank you .
delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers
of our nation &apos;s commerce .
it &apos;s because of people like you ,
people like me can limit our human contact .
i &apos;d shake your hand , but , well , you know .
i &apos;m not a delivery man , i @-@ i &apos;m a doctor .
although i do often deliver
alarming biopsy results to my patients .
that &apos;s humorous .
all right .
yeah , i @-@ i bet you leave your patients in stitches .
that was also humorous .
all right .
are you bringing flowers to a patient
to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis ?
that wasn &apos;t a joke .
all right .
these are actually for a nice woman
who makes sales calls to my office .
you know , they have delivery people that will do that for you .
i was hoping to impress her
by tracking her down on the internet
and then showing up unannounced at her door .
making the extra effort .
good for you .
great timing , food just got here .
ooh , siam palace ?
yes .
uh , mee krob and chicken satay ?
yes .
uh , extra peanut sauce ?
no , but you can have mine .
eh , well , very well .
oh , and on the topic of sharing things that are yours ,
there is a gentleman caller
bringing flowers to your fiancee as we speak .
what ?
why didn &apos;t you say that first ?
why didn &apos;t you get extra peanut sauce ?
we can both play this game .
can i help you ?
oh , hi .
uh , does penny live here ?
may i ask why ?
i @-@ i met her at my office , she winked at me .
i @-@ i came hoping to initiate a romantic relationship .
look , i &apos;m pretty sure she didn &apos;t wink at you .
oh , she did .
seductively , like this .
and then she touched my arm for two mississippis .
like , you know , one mississippi , two ...
i got it , i got it .
listen , um ...
i think there &apos;s been a misunderstanding .
see , penny is my fiancee .
really ?
i &apos;ve never seen her wear an engagement ring .
really ?
so , am i to presume
that her flirtation was just a sales technique ?
i think so .
when will i learn ?
it &apos;s just like the cute girl at the pet store all over again .
excuse me ?
oh , uh , she touched my arm for five mississippis ,
and i bought a $ 2,000 iguana habitat .
which she was always too busy to come over and see .
you give these to penny .
you &apos;re , you &apos;re a lucky man .
thank you .
sorry .
you probably don &apos;t want her to see this .
it &apos;s unnecessarily graphic .
hold on , doctor .
leonard , where are your social skills ?
this man is clearly upset .
we should invite him in for a hot beverage .
he tried to score with penny .
so have these two , and they &apos;re having dinner with us .
so , how was work today ?
it was fine , but you &apos;ll be happy to know
they pulled the sexy scientists article .
what happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
they just canceled the photo shoot
and said they &apos;re rethinking it .
well , i &apos;m really sorry ,
but i think it &apos;s for the best .
you want people focusing on your achievements ,
not staring at your breasts in some magazine .
i guess .
it &apos;s really not that important .
hey , up here .
sorry , we &apos;re ... we were talking about them .
so , look , i @-@ i wasn &apos;t going to say anything ,
but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled ,
i have a little confession .
i &apos;m the reason it was pulled .
what ? how ?
i sent the editors of the magazine
a pretty scathing e @-@ mail .
amy , what did you say ?
i simply pointed out
that they would never consider doing an article
ranking male scientists on their sexuality ,
let alone showing them in various stages of undress .
because no one wants to see neil degrasse tyson
in a wet t @-@ shirt , bent over the hood of a porsche .
well , it doesn &apos;t make a difference ,
because they agreed it was in bad taste ,
and now you agree , so ...
amy saves the day .
no , what happened was you got jealous ,
so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity .
but it was bad publicity .
that &apos;s for me to decide , not you .
i disagree .
as a female scientist , i think what you do affects all of us .
and i think you don &apos;t like people expressing their sexuality
because no one wants you to express yours .
oh , amy , i &apos;m so sorry .
that was over the line .
you have a nice night .
please don &apos;t go .
up until my vicious attack , you were the one in the wrong .
here you go , doctor .
red zinger with one teaspoon of honey .
thank you .
neat star trek mug .
i actually have one of the phasers from the original tv show .
oh , cool .
how &apos;d you get that ?
oh , easy , gene roddenberry needed a vasectomy .
wait a minute .
you &apos;ve snipped gene roddenberry &apos;s vas deferens ?
yes .
wow , he really went where no man has gone before .
源自 《 星际迷航 : 原初系列 》 开场导语中的一句短语
i don &apos;t like to brag , but , uh , you see ,
i &apos;m kind of the doctor to the stars &apos; urinary tracts .
uh , you , you want to see james cameron &apos;s kidney stone ?
也是 《 泰坦尼克号 》 与 《 阿凡达 》 的导演
he was so happy after he passed it ,
he gave me a terminator .
that is amazing .
how long have you been collecting ?
ever since i was a kid ,
but , uh , i didn &apos;t really get serious
until william shatner &apos;s bladder infection .
what &apos;d you get ? what &apos;d you get ?
well , he said it was a tribble .
it could be a toupee ,
but either way , it &apos;s pretty cool .
i @-@ i would love to see your collection .
anytime .
uh , i &apos;ve got some cool stuff .
when i first started ,
i thought it would be a good way to meet women ,
but , well , you know ...
sure .
preach .
can i ask you a personal question ?
sure .
um , i mean , you &apos;re a guy like me ,
so how &apos;d you get a girl like penny ?
well , you know , just ...
being myself , really .
oh , please !
you know , i &apos;ll tell you how he did it .
implacable , relentless badgering .
in urology terms ,
he was a drug @-@ resistant staph infection .
and she was a urethra that could not shake him .
i don &apos;t know that i &apos;d call myself an infection .
a gallant man would defend
his fiancee for being called a urethra .
can we please change the subject ?
well , that didn &apos;t go your way .
dr. lorvis , what are you doing here ?
uh , well , actually i came to see you .
really ? why ?
ah , that &apos;s a good question .
apparently someone was being awfully flirty
while not wearing their engagement ring ,
causing another someone to show up here
thinking the first someone might be available .
oh , god . don &apos;t make it so hard on her .
look , the first someone is the deceitful you .
the second someone
is the delightful dr. lorvis .
oh , this is very embarrassing .
dr. lorvis , i am so sorry .
i did not mean to lead you on .
you touched my arm for two mississippis .
that &apos;s why you were mumbling &quot; mississippi . &quot;
can we talk in private ?
please , yes .
i &apos;ll be right back .
so what other celebrity genitalia have you handled ?
so , uh , what &apos;s the deal ?
you take off your ring when you go to work ?
what ? no ! no !
i just put it on the other hand and ...
turn it around .
keep that hand in my pocket .
why ?
well , what do you mean why ?
look , i make more sales
if these doctors think i &apos;m single .
i did the same kind of thing as a waitress .
the real question is , what is he doing in your apartment ?
oh , he was upset .
so sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage .
you were okay with that ?
no . i got upset !
and sheldon made me a beverage , too .
okay , he just showed up at my door .
don &apos;t you think that &apos;s a little weird ?
a little , but ... he &apos;s basically harmless .
he &apos;s actually kind of a nice guy .
okay .
whatever , look , my company does not allow me
to socialize with doctors outside of work .
you got to get rid of him .
why am i the one that has to get rid of him ?
i can &apos;t do it ! he &apos;s my best client !
all right , i &apos;ll get rid of him .
but you owe me one .
hey , we &apos;re going to oliver &apos;s house to see his collection .
you want to go with us ?
yeah , sure .
you owe me .
oh , my god !
leonard , i was wrong .
heaven does exist .
and it &apos;s in the basement of a urologist &apos;s house
in sherman oaks .
welcome to my fortress of solitude .
this is where i go to get away from ...
all my other solitude .
oh , come on . it &apos;s a replica .
original .
oh , i think i just cheated on my wife .
the gun from hellboy ?
yup .
how did you get it ?
bought it at auction .
oh , i was hoping for a juicy tidbit
about ron perlman &apos;s testicles .
oliver ! i &apos;m going to play bingo !
okay , mother . have fun .
still lives with his mom .
yikes , right ?
yeah , i &apos;m not quite sure how to respond .
wow , donkey kong !
this @-@ this was my game when i was a kid !
because it &apos;s a story of a pretty blonde girl
tirelessly pursued by a small , oddly @-@ shaped man ?
no , because i liked it .
well , now , don &apos;t get defensive .
you &apos;re oddly @-@ shaped , but you got the girl .
so , i &apos;ve noticed leonard gets teased a lot
about his relationship with penny .
yes . if you &apos;d like to join in ,
the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure .
so , you think she &apos;ll be single soon ?
oh , if you want to get in on the pool ,
you &apos;re too late ...
all the squares have been purchased .
interesting .
excuse me , i have to take care of something .
leonard , as your friend i feel
i should tell you something .
what ?
i &apos;m still upset about that peanut sauce .
oh , could you hold the door ?
nice flowers .
thank you .
they &apos;re for a girl .
uh , i &apos;m being implacable and relentless .
isn &apos;t she lucky ?
she keeps sending me mixed signals .
but i @-@ i think we both want the same thing .
what &apos;s that ?
unconditional love .
i guess that &apos;s all anybody wants .
i guess so .
well , i hope you get it .
one mississippi , two mississippi .
next game , let &apos;s switch helmets .
no , i &apos;d look silly in that helmet .
i @-@ i can &apos;t take these .
well , why not ?
i mean , you want what i want .
and we had two wonderful mississippis .
but what about the other girl ?
oh , right .
i &apos;ll tell her we should just be friends .
dr. lorvis ?
penny , we should just be friends .
happy ?
you think he bites ?
stick your hand in there and find out .
you fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo .
you will not fool me again .
i wonder where dr. lorvis is .
he &apos;s been gone a while .
maybe he &apos;s playing bingo with his mommy .
it &apos;s sad how some guys can &apos;t cut the apron strings .
okay , now you &apos;re messing with me .
uh , guys , we &apos;re locked in here .
oh , this day just keeps getting better !
so , you just left them alone playing games in your house ?
well , they seemed happy and ...
i thought that would give me time
for you and i to get to know each other better .
that was before we met .
we all have a past .
doc , you &apos;ve got to see what you &apos;re doing
is @-@ is a little creepy .
you sound just like sigourney weaver
when i followed her into a restroom .
okay , you can &apos;t just go chasing after
every girl who &apos;s nice to you .
well , that &apos;s not what sheldon says .
and he seems to know his way around the ladies .
hey , leonard . guess who &apos;s back ! dr. lorvis !
yeah . you care to join us ?
what ? !
you locked them in your basement ? !
well , they &apos;re , they &apos;re not locked in .
the door just sticks .
okay , so how do they unstick it ?
they &apos;d need the key .
okay .
nope . that &apos;s it .
we are gonna go over there right now .
and you are going to let them out .
three mississippi , four mississippi ...
move it !
oh , good , you &apos;re here .
amy , i am so sorry .
that has to wait . this weirdo locked
the guys up in his basement .
what ? !
she seems nice . who &apos;s she ?
just walk .
you can do this .
one ladder left !
oh @-@ ho ! yeah !
yes !
next level !
leonard , are you okay ?
better than okay .
i am having the game of my life !
dr. lorvis , isn &apos;t there something you want to say ?
yes .
i &apos;m very sorry for locking you in my home .
yeah , that was very uncool .
get the hammer ! get the hammer !
got it .
okay , leonard , let &apos;s go !
j @-@ just hang on !
well , while we wait ,
would you like to see tobey maguire &apos;s prostate sonogram ?
sure . yeah .
oh , spoiler alert .
uh , he was worried about nothing .
