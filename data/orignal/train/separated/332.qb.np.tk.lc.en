i just found two fives in the couch !
which brings us to 5 , 10 , carry the one ...
a new low .
hello , i &apos;m murray .
did you order curry in a hurry ?
i don &apos;t know . is it paid for ?
yeah .
then , yes , we did .
max , you &apos;re awful .
we didn &apos;t pay for that .
it &apos;s indian food .
we &apos;ll pay for it in three hours .
any samosas in there ?
you want some naan ?
&apos;cause whoever ordered it ain &apos;t gettin &apos; naan .
did you guys see murray with our curry in a hurry ?
nope , sorry .
just a heads up , the samosas are a little dry
and also completely gone .
i need all the energy i can get .
sophie and i are doin &apos; it &apos; round the clock .
she wants a baby so bad ,
she even got an ovulation app on her phone .
sophie &apos;s phone has a fertility app ?
my phone &apos;s so old it can &apos;t get pregnant .
tells us when she &apos;s most fertile .
actually , a little cartoon monkey tells us .
what &apos;s his name ?
overly curious george ?
oleg , it &apos;s time . see ?
the monkey &apos;s got a boner .
i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s a banana .
it &apos;s yellow and he &apos;s holding it . it &apos;s a boner .
sophie , don &apos;t get your hopes up .
we &apos;ve had so much sex ,
it &apos;s basically just steam coming out now .
oh , you found the food . good .
you mind if i use your stomach as a tray
so i can eat while we do it ?
do i ever mind ?
i have to block out so much now just to get through the day .
wow , we have more visitors than
a mildly attractive prostitute at comic @-@ con.
it &apos;s mookie for the rent .
okay , max , this time can you do
the blow @-@ it @-@ up hand thing with him ?
i &apos;ve tried it , but i &apos;m just not good at hand stuff .
ask anyone at yale prep .
just give it a shot !
you also thought you couldn &apos;t eat food that &apos;s been stepped on .
look at you now .
sup , ladies ? sorry i &apos;m late .
some guy threw a cat at me .
who &apos;s gonna blow it up for me ?
i &apos;m not allowed to blow stuff up anymore .
my parole officer &apos;s rules , not mine .
i know that was bad . i &apos;m sorry .
is there a class i can take ?
i &apos;ll go get the last of the rent money .
it &apos;s either in my bra pile , or i don &apos;t have it .
take your time . we cool .
so , what kind of name is &quot; mookie &quot; ?
is it short for something ?
long for something ?
max , hurry up , girl .
okay , you should have $ 800
and here &apos;s the last of it .
sweet . well , i gotta go .
i got a tennis lesson .
caroline , wanna try again ?
make sure you get the whole $ 825 .
no funny business down there , gangsta .
825 ? the rent is 850 .
no , always been 825 .
what &apos;s going on now ?
max , why do you tell me the rent &apos;s 850 if it &apos;s 825 ?
oh , yeah , i &apos;ma go ahead and--
good luck with that .
you &apos;ve been overcharging me rent ?
it &apos;s not like that .
how is it not like that ?
okay , it &apos;s exactly like that .
seriously , max , other than the rent ,
what else have you not been telling the truth about ?
you probably didn &apos;t even see emma stone at costco .
and is max black even your real name ?
it &apos;s a real name .
hey , in my defense ,
you do have a bigger bedroom .
that &apos;s because i sleep in the living room .
can you just let this go ?
so i took a little off the top .
everybody takes a little off the top .
look what god did to han .
don &apos;t drag me into the middle of pretty little liars .
i &apos;ve got two ferrets at home with the stomach flu ,
and i don &apos;t need it .
now everyone stop what you &apos;re not doing .
i &apos;m calling an emergency staff meeting .
is this the whole ,
&quot; don &apos;t ice your junk in the food sink &quot; thing again ?
no , i have a rule .
20 warnings , then it &apos;s a dead issue .
this is about all of you .
we need to talk about diner teamwork .
oh , our teamwork &apos;s fine .
for example , we &apos;re covering for earl
while he chases the ice cream man .
got me a chaco taco .
everybody , sit down .
why ? so we can be eye level ?
good put @-@ down , caroline .
see , han ? teamwork .
all right , listen to our latest yelp reviews .
daryl b. says ,
&quot; sat in booth an hour before anyone talked to me .
when someone did ,
it was the waitress asking me for water . &quot;
i was thirsty !
and daryl b. was real slow with that water .
you don &apos;t see me yelping about it .
i &apos;ll read one .
caroline c. from here says ,
&quot; max has been overcharging me $ 25 a month for four years . &quot;
that sounds made up .
so tomorrow night , i &apos;m closing the diner ,
and we &apos;re all working on our team building skills .
so no one cares that
max has been stealing $ 25 a month from me ?
that &apos;s correct .
right this way .
what the hell is this place ?
this looks like the room i was kept in
when that trucker borrowed me for three days .
did you overcharge him too ?
you &apos;ll all find out where we are soon enough .
all part of the adventure ,
and the mystery , and the--
did i say adventure ?
oh no , this isn &apos;t one of those escape rooms
where they lock you in a room
and you have to work as a team to get out ?
welcome to the escape room ,
where we lock you in a room ,
and you have to work as a team to get out .
and so it begins !
what ? us beating the crap out of you ?
together , of course .
now let me get this straight .
y &apos;all are volunteering
to be locked up in a tiny room ?
see now , that &apos;s some white people stuff right there .
it &apos;s a fun way for us all to learn
how to work together to solve a problem .
if the group of us could work together to solve a problem ,
you &apos;d be back in korea .
i &apos;m in no rush to get home to sophie .
i mean , i love her and she &apos;s a fox ,
but baby @-@ making is brutal .
i &apos;m so tired of having my legs up in the air .
how do you-- what do you--
how would that-- let &apos;s just move past it .
sign these waivers saying that
if anything happens to you ,
it is entirely your fault .
nobody &apos;s signing these waivers . we &apos;re not idiots .
we &apos;re gonna read through all the fine print .
done .
here you go .
oh , well , i &apos;m gonna read mine anyway .
caroline reads everything .
she read the entire itunes user agreement before she bought
rihanna &apos;s &quot; bitch better have my money . &quot;
wish i &apos;d read the fine print
when i agreed to be your roommate .
turns out , bitch do have my money .
do i have to escape from this too ?
i mean , is this part of the game ?
is this a bad time to tell you
your horse masterminded the whole thing ?
before we start , i need to collect your phones
so you can &apos;t google answers .
don &apos;t look at my screensaver
unless you have a strong stomach .
i &apos;ve seen lots of phones .
it takes a lot to shock-- aah !
why are your legs up ?
ah , white light means it &apos;s a go .
hey , hold up ! aah !
oh , one second .
you know , i &apos;m breathin &apos; harder
than paula deen on dancing with the stars .
sophie ?
how did you find me here ?
i told you to take that
&quot; find my husband &quot; app off your phone .
yeah , well ... i didn &apos;t .
yeah . we &apos;re trying to make a baby .
sophie , you can &apos;t be here right now .
this is a work team @-@ building thing
and you &apos;re not part of the team .
right , han ?
she can stay .
she does as much at the diner as the girls do .
well , i gotta stay close to oleg .
you know , the monkey &apos;s unpredictable .
you never know when he &apos;s gonna demand intercourse .
well , that &apos;s a fun wrinkle .
okay , this is the whitest thing i &apos;ve ever seen ,
and i &apos;ve seen those shoes that have toes .
oh , hell no .
i &apos;m feeling angry , scared ,
and both of max &apos;s boobs .
is this our version of make @-@ up sex ?
i can &apos;t see a thing !
here , let me use my pepper spray flashlight .
hey , i &apos;m starting to like this now .
hey ! look at all those kooky light switches !
let &apos;s try that !
whoever this guy is says ,
&quot; choose correctly or lost five minutes . &quot;
wow , you &apos;re no whoever that guy is , oleg .
10 , 20 , 26 switches !
what other things are 26 ?
hmm , that &apos;s one more dollar than max has been stealing from me .
how about something a little more universal
and a lot less annoying ?
there are 26 letters in the alphabet .
thank you , comrade kangaroo .
okay , 26 letters . which one could represent light ?
light starts with &quot; l &quot; !
oh , wow , he &apos;s good !
too easy . it &apos;s einstein
so the answer must be scientific .
wait , in einstein &apos;s famous formula e = mc2,
the speed of light is represented by the letter &quot; c. &quot;
a ... b ... c .
oh , it &apos;s alice in wonderland themed !
i &apos;ll be great at this .
it was always my favorite story .
sophie and i only watch the hard @-@ core porno version .
yeah , it was called alice in underpants .
and our dentist was in it !
that &apos;s enough of all your chatter !
it &apos;s time to listen to the mad hatter .
i think it &apos;s the same guy as before .
he &apos;s a genius !
you filled this room with illumination ,
but you are not done with this situation .
what rhymes with &quot; kick in the crotch &quot; ?
to proceed and be done with me ,
you must answer these riddles three .
y &apos;all know i &apos;m 80 , right ?
one : take it out of the package .
it goes in your mouth .
chew it too long , and it will go south .
it &apos;s what earl &apos;s doing right now .
oh , lord , am i peeing ?
no , he &apos;s chewing gum .
&quot; take it out of the package . it goes in your mouth .
chew it too long and it &apos;ll go south . &quot;
gum .
exactamente .
that wasn &apos;t too hard .
put your answer onto this card .
well done !
this groupon has already paid for itself .
two : arnold schwarzenegger &apos;s is big ;
michael j. fox &apos;s is small ;
the pope has one but doesn &apos;t use it ;
madonna doesn &apos;t have one at all .
dongs . the answer is dongs .
c &apos;mon , oleg , i mean nobody can say for sure
that madonna doesn &apos;t have one .
dongs aren &apos;t the answer to everything .
i used to think that .
you know where that got me ?
pennsylvania , with no car .
schwarzenegger &apos;s big , fox &apos;s small .
it &apos;s last names . the pope doesn &apos;t use his .
madonna doesn &apos;t have one at all . that &apos;s it !
correctamundo .
with your brain power ,
you &apos;ll be out of here in under an hour .
well , thanks , but if i was that smart ,
i wouldn &apos;t have spent the last four years
getting ripped off by my roommate .
oh , come on , are you still on the money ?
oh , my god , my sister lost both her thumbs in a combine accident
and she didn &apos;t talk about it this much .
ah , here &apos;s $ 25 .
let &apos;s call it hush money ,
so hush .
first of all , this is $ 12,
and fine ,
you won &apos;t hear a peep out of me anymore .
fine , i don &apos;t care if we never get out .
all right , fyi ,
yeah , oleg and i are gonna get really amsterdam @-@ y up in here .
all right , we gotta get the hell out .
come on , caroline . where &apos;s your sense of whimsy ?
and don &apos;t say max stole it ,
because that &apos;s getting older than randy &apos;s accent .
sorry , randy , i knew you were a safe person to slam .
time moves forward . it doesn &apos;t go back .
you &apos;ve got 15 minutes . it &apos;s 45 that you lack .
come on , guys .
we don &apos;t need caroline to solve these puzzles .
this is the same team that was able
to figure out the wi @-@ fi password
to the women &apos;s shelter next to the diner .
who said this ?
&quot; if it was so , it might be ;
and if it were so , it would be . &quot;
the fat twins ?
&apos;cause that made no sense
and they look like they get stoned a lot .
okay , oleg , drop your pants .
the monkey wants his banana .
caroline ,
if i have to see oleg so much as honk one of her boobs ,
i &apos;m gonna lose it .
i would help you , and be your heaven @-@ sent ,
but you screwed me on the rent .
what is it gonna take to make you get over this ?
you haven &apos;t even apologized .
okay . i am sorry .
are we good ?
you know what ? no , we not good .
aw , come on !
fine , i &apos;m the only one here who knows this story ,
and i &apos;m the only one who knows how to get out of here .
there , the rabbit hole ,
alice went down and so will i.
that &apos;s it .
this is a bigger bust than max &apos;s future .
just like alice , i &apos;m sick of being stuck
in this upside @-@ down world
when your best friend lies about the rent .
no , you can &apos;t !
oh , yes , i can .
i bid you adieu .
no , seriously , don &apos;t !
ooh , i &apos;m next !
i don &apos;t mean to burst your bubble ,
but your friend &apos;s in a lot of trouble .
what i &apos;m saying is :
that &apos;s not part of the room . that &apos;s just for show .
you &apos;re not supposed to jump in it .
i &apos;m not next .
so that &apos;s not a cute rabbit hole ?
rabbits ? no .
couple of rats , though .
this place is a deathtrap .
caroline , please tell me you &apos;re okay .
i can &apos;t , because i &apos;m not .
i &apos;ll use the emergency code to get us out of here .
5 ... 9 ... 4 ... 7 .
okay , i &apos;m gonna be real honest with you right now .
i don &apos;t know the codes .
help , there &apos;s something moving down here !
i &apos;m going in .
sophie , give me the pepper spray flashlight .
all right , yeah .
hurry !
that really does sting .
okay , oleg , now it &apos;s time .
it &apos;s that beautiful moment
where you and i are gonna make a baby
right in front of your coworkers .
can we have a little more class
and wait till we get in the cab ?
what ?
we &apos;re gonna do it on top of teacups .
that &apos;s pretty classy .
what is happening ?
you know what ?
spray some of that stuff in your mind .
max , look .
oh , that &apos;s why his leg &apos;s up in the air .
i &apos;ve seen enough . i &apos;m out .
ugh , i think i landed on what was moving .
so that &apos;s dead now .
oh , my god . are you okay ?
yeah , i think . are you ?
yeah .
wait , you said you weren &apos;t okay .
i meant emotionally .
i jumped into a floor hole for feelings ?
well , my feelings are really hurt , max .
it &apos;s been four years .
well , i don &apos;t know what to do ,
because like the sad hatter said ,
time goes forward ; it doesn &apos;t go back .
i can &apos;t undo the rent thing .
i just thought we were in this together ,
50 / 50 .
we are ,
and i should have told you four years ago ,
but i thought we wouldn &apos;t last a month .
but then we did , and then another month ,
and i &apos;m still not sure how this happened :
we became best friends .
max , that &apos;s the first time you &apos;ve ever called me
your best friend without a bribe ,
and that &apos;s worth a lot more than money ,
and you know how much i love money .
yeah , you almost ruined our friendship over it .
all right , come on , let &apos;s get out of here .
i &apos;m not okay .
searing pain , searing pain .
ugh , i think i twisted my ankle when i jumped down here .
oh , my god . i am so sorry .
you &apos;re right .
sometimes sorry just doesn &apos;t cut it .
so how are we gonna get you out of here ?
if you want me to carry you ,
you &apos;ll have to take off your boobs .
which way should we go ?
my sense of direction led me to being a waitress in brooklyn .
you know what ? let &apos;s go forward .
&apos;cause much like the time , you can &apos;t go back .
also , the moving thing just came to and looks mad .
go .
max , i &apos;ve never been this close to your butt before ,
and it &apos;s spectacular !
what &apos;s your secret ?
i &apos;m 27 .
i really shouldn &apos;t be seeing this .
can we please turn the lights back off ?
oh , god , help me !
well , one good thing about being down here :
sophie and oleg are up there .
wait , why is the floor sagging ?
oh , my god .
you know , i &apos;m pretty sure that fall
knocked the baby right up into me .
correction , if i could turn the clock back ,
i wouldn &apos;t go back four years .
i &apos;d go back 30 seconds .
