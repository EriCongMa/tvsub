please come home , a.j.
i can &apos;t do that to ty .
mom , i &apos;m just afraid that if he stays with his brother ,
he &apos;s gonna get in some real trouble .
a.j , we &apos;re arresting your brother
because he was involved in a hit @-@ and @-@ run
that injured mariana and jesus ,
but we &apos;re gonna have to take you in for running away .
i &apos;m here to see a.j. hensdale .
you &apos;re not on his list .
it &apos;s open auditions , right ?
all right , but aren &apos;t you gonna be too busy
with junior class president and all that ?
i lost . lexi won .
i &apos;m jesus , your son .
you gotta leave .
why ?
i can &apos;t ... legally be around you .
do you know about privatized homes ?
if there &apos;s something we could do about that ?
the most important thing for us
to do right now is to look at the big picture .
we &apos;re doing a skin @-@ sparing mastectomy .
how can i help ?
i &apos;m scared .
35 % of foster kids will be incarcerated
at some point before they reach age 18 .
66 % of foster kids who age out
will end up either homeless , in jail , or dead
within one year .
how could we expect otherwise
when this is how we care for them ?
i was one of the lucky ones .
曾被寄养
after seven different foster placements ,
i finally found a home ... and a family .
but , as someone who barely survived it ,
i can tell you the system is severely broken .
help kids like me find the homes they deserve .
support sb @-@ 3301 .
so , what do you think ?
well , it &apos;s very , very powerful .
yeah , we think so .
i guess we just didn &apos;t realize that callie would be supporting
some new piece of legislation .
i &apos;m sorry .
i assumed you knew .
we &apos;re trying to make some real change here .
yeah , and the statehouse is where that happens .
right .
that &apos;s a good thing , right ?
we &apos;re not saying that it &apos;s not , but ...
it &apos;s just that you &apos;re endorsing a bill
that we know nothing about , cal .
have you read it ?
no , not like word for word ...
okay .
but i know that it &apos;s trying to reform the system ,
and i trust justina .
well , we certainly don &apos;t mean to suggest ...
but you kind of are .
you know what , callie ?
your moms are absolutely right . you should all read it .
i &apos;ll get you a copy as soon as i can .
thank you .
that would be great . appreciate it .
you know , there is something i &apos;ve been waiting to tell you , callie .
apparently , the work we &apos;ve been doing has been getting a lot of attention ,
and ... we have been invited to the white house next month .
are you serious ?
yeah .
yeah , they &apos;re having a symposium on foster care ,
and they want us to be there .
wow . that &apos;s amazing .
of course , we need to look at the calendar ...
callie &apos;s school work and all that .
of course .
okay , i &apos;m gonna go and i &apos;ll talk to you later , callie .
i &apos;ll let myself out .
thank you . thank you very much .
are you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
bye .
take it easy . it &apos;s not been that long since surgery .
what is wrong with you guys ?
excuse me ?
it &apos;s the white house .
yes . it is a great opportunity , callie ,
and hopefully you can go .
hopefully ?
you have a lot on your plate already , honey .
we can &apos;t let fost and found and all of this
distract you from your school work .
it &apos;s not .
what about your senior project ?
you still haven &apos;t even declared what you &apos;re doing .
i have it figured out .
i &apos;m gonna talk to rita tomorrow .
okay , good .
so , what &apos;s the problem ?
callie ,
we really don &apos;t know justina at all .
but i do , and she &apos;s doing a lot for me .
and why are you always so suspicious of everyone ?
no , hold on . wanting to read the bill
that you are being used to support
is not being suspicious , callie , it &apos;s being smart .
i &apos;ll get it .
oh , unless you guys are afraid it &apos;s home invasion .
hey , callie .
i just want you guys to know how bad i feel about what happened .
look , i know my brother did a terrible thing ...
and then we just took off after all the ...
you &apos;re doing great .
after all the nice stuff you guys did for me ...
i should &apos;ve made ty turn himself in , but i was just ...
i was afraid i wasn &apos;t gonna see him again .
so , anyway ...
i &apos;m sorry .
we get it , a.j.
family is everything .
it &apos;s good of you to come here
and say all of that , a.j. thank you .
yeah . good job .
i &apos;ll wait outside .
hey , you got a sec ?
i just ... wanna know how you are doing .
well , for 10 days since the surgery ,
i &apos;m doing pretty well .
that was really brave .
which part ?
me running away or missing my grandma &apos;s funeral ?
no , i meant ...
i know what you meant , callie .
did they tell you i tried to come see you in juvie ?
like , a few times ?
i had no idea what your brother had done
when i told stef where you were .
i swear to you . and as soon as i found out ,
i called you .
have you heard from ty ?
i got a letter from him .
that &apos;s good .
is he okay ?
i &apos;m gonna go wait in the car .
yeah . it &apos;s killing me , though . too slow .
things have been drying up for me .
you guys been keeping busy ?
you want one , right ?
i told you ... stay away from me .
i know you did , and i know why , too .
i know what you are . you &apos;re disgusting .
then what are you doing here ?
i don &apos;t want it .
i don &apos;t want anything from you .
there you are . i haven &apos;t seen you in forever .
yeah , i know . i &apos;ve just been so busy , you know ?
tell me about it .
this whole student government thing is a lot of work .
okay . i &apos;ve gotta get to class .
hey . how &apos;s your mom ?
a lot better . thanks for asking .
you &apos;re welcome .
so , does that mean i get to take you out now , or ...
you are really gunning for those french fries , aren &apos;t you ?
oh , no , no , no , &apos; cause you kept me waiting for two weeks ,
you owe me french fries plus interest .
yeah , it &apos;s a full @-@ on date now ... all four food groups .
fine .
sweet .
hey , where is jesus ? is he sick today or something ?
so , for the student council &apos;s community outreach project this year ,
here &apos;s what i was thinking .
i thought if we take this space in city heights
and turn it into a park or a community garden .
it &apos;s very impressive .
and i was thinking ,
if i design the gardens and oversee the execution ,
it could also be my senior thesis .
yeah , i don &apos;t see why not .
actually ...
since the school funds the outreach program ,
it could be perceived that we are also funding your thesis ,
which is against the rules .
yeah , that makes sense .
yeah , i &apos;ll just ... i &apos;ll think of something else .
what if she got the materials donated ?
yeah . i guess that could work .
yeah , i bet if you show the local nurseries what we just saw ,
they &apos;ll be lining up to help .
thank you .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s a great idea .
yeah .
i &apos;ll try , thank you .
she &apos;s an incredible young woman , isn &apos;t she ?
yeah , she is .
where did you go this morning ?
what ?
you missed first period . where were you ?
it &apos;s none of your business .
fine . i &apos;ll tell mama .
i went to give gabe his tool belt back .
what ? why ?
because i didn &apos;t want it anymore .
so ... why not throw it away ?
because i wanted to tell him that we know what he did .
who cares ?
i do !
all right ? i care .
you want a to write a paper about me ?
yeah , for my senior thesis .
well , what about me ?
i don &apos;t know , like , how good you are at your job ,
and everything you do here at gu .
i haven &apos;t really figured it out yet ,
but you &apos;re like my mentor .
plus my moms are all over me to pick something ,
so i told them i was gonna do this .
well , i &apos;m very honored .
i &apos;m sure we could work something out .
so , you know what ?
i was looking at the new and improved &quot; fost and found &quot; app ,
it looks really great .
yeah , i know , right ?
and it looks ... so real and important .
yeah , it &apos;s impressive .
i ... i got invited to the white house .
what ?
for the foster care symposium ?
yeah . i mean , if my moms let me go .
oh , come on , why wouldn &apos;t they let you go ?
i guess they &apos;re not too excited
about the work i &apos;ve been doing with justina .
why not ? what &apos;s going on ?
she &apos;s been working on this foster reform bill .
oh . she &apos;s the one behind that .
yeah . stef got really weird and suspicious
and said she wanted to read the whole thing .
no , you know , honey ,
they &apos;re just being your moms . that &apos;s their job .
you know they &apos;re really proud of you , right ?
i guess . they &apos;re so annoying .
what ?
it &apos;s funny to hear you sound like a normal teenager .
shut up . how &apos;s that for a normal teenager ?
sure , that &apos;s good too .
so , have you read it , the bill ?
no , she hasn &apos;t sent it over yet .
i did .
how &apos;d you get it ?
i &apos;m very connected .
it &apos;s my business . it wasn &apos;t hard .
and ?
there &apos;s some good things in it ,
but it does allocate
over 50 % of the state foster care budget to privatized homes .
what ? no , okay , that doesn &apos;t make any sense ,
&apos;cause justina &apos;s against privatization .
not if she supports this bill , she isn &apos;t .
hey , stranger .
long time no see .
guessing my kid &apos;s car seat really scared you off , huh ?
actually , my mom had surgery ,
so i had to take some time off .
oh . sorry .
is she okay ?
yeah .
good .
well , it &apos;s probably a good thing that we got to ...
put the brakes on things .
you &apos;re too young to be dating a woman with a kid , right ?
don &apos;t tell me what i think .
and the big highlight of my day was being shown up by my boss
in front of the student body president . that was great .
is everything okay ?
yeah . yeah , it &apos;s just , you know , frustrating .
hey , so ... i &apos;m kind of worried about jesus .
what ? what ? why ?
well , he found our birth dad .
jesus ! get in here , please .
but that &apos;s not all .
the guy &apos;s a sex offender .
i was looking him up online
and he &apos;s on the sex offender registry thingee .
look , i only worked with him for a few days .
you worked with him , jesus ?
stef , calm down .
i didn &apos;t tell them that part .
no , no , wait , okay , listen to me , the two of you .
you are never to go near this man again .
do you hear me ? all right ?
you have no idea who you are dealing with .
he could be very , very dangerous ,
and this is not me overreacting .
this is not me giving you
a parental warning that you can just ignore ,
because you think that i &apos;m being ridiculous .
this could be very serious . you understand me ?
no , no , i want to hear you say &quot; yes . &quot;
yes .
yes , thank you .
hey , man .
i ... i wasn &apos;t gonna say anything ,
&apos;cause it seemed like it was never actually gonna happen ,
but i &apos;m taking your sister out tonight .
what ? who ? callie ?
no , your twin sister .
no , no , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s impossible ,
see , &apos; cause we have this &quot; no dating each other &apos;s friends &quot; policy
that she made .
well , i guess she &apos;s in violation .
yeah . i guess she is .
cool , now that the cat &apos;s out of the bag ,
i could use some advice .
i wanna , you know , impress her , so tell me ... what should i do ?
i got just the thing .
ooh ! you look great .
thank you . i want you to meet my moms .
this is nick .
hello .
hi , nice to see you again .
oh ! is that your challenger out there ?
it is , yeah .
oh . you know i &apos;m a cop , yeah ?
well , actually , it &apos;s not ...
i know
pretty much all of the cops in town ,
and if you go two miles
over the speed limit , i will hear about it .
and after i impound your car ,
you will never see my beautiful daughter again .
she &apos;s kidding .
no .
so , where ... where are you guys headed tonight ?
yeah .
oh , we &apos;re just gonna grab a burger , you know ?
come on , we &apos;re gonna be late to pick up lexi .
oh , a double date . that sounds good .
♪ you caught his eye , surf girl ♪
♪ i wonder why , surf girl ♪
♪ you won &apos;t try , surf girl ♪
♪ to see him ♪
♪ he &apos;s high and dry , surf girl ♪
♪ it makes me cry , surf girl ♪
♪ just please reply , surf girl ♪
♪ with &quot; yes &quot; ♪
♪ to him ♪
thank you , thank you .
so ?
i told you .
going out with me is not a good idea .
give me one reason why not .
among other things , i just don &apos;t have the time .
well , what if i ... found you the time ?
that makes even less sense than the song you just made up .
well , you didn &apos;t answer the question .
thanks for coming over .
of course .
you sounded upset on the phone ,
so what &apos;s going on ?
i read the bill .
okay .
and it &apos;s totally pro @-@ privatization .
no . i mean , well , that &apos;s part of it , sure ,
but it &apos;s a comprehensive ...
no , no , please don &apos;t talk to me like i &apos;m stupid .
you know how i feel about privatized homes .
my friend kiara was almost killed in one of these places .
callie , i don &apos;t mean to talk down to you ,
but i would appreciate a chance to explain .
i think i &apos;ve earned that right , don &apos;t you ?
after all i &apos;ve done to help you ?
as part ... of more comprehensive reform ,
privatization is incredibly effective .
by taking the money out of the hands of bureaucrats ,
and spending it directly on the kids who need help
and the families who are helping them ,
we can get so much more done .
all the money isn &apos;t going to the kids .
the companies doing the placement are making a profit .
well , why shouldn &apos;t they make a profit when they &apos;re providing
a superior service and taking big risks to do it ?
think about it . when something bad happens in a privatized home ,
who &apos;s responsible ? the company , the ceo .
right now , if something goes wrong ,
everyone in the system just passes the buck ,
and nothing ever changes .
this all just blows up the system .
yeah , because it needs to be blown up .
all right , think about it .
your school , anchor beach ... it &apos;s a charter school , right ?
yeah .
yeah , so they &apos;re taking government money
out of the system , and they &apos;re using it to create a better ,
more responsive , more creative education for you , right ?
yeah , well , then that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing with foster care .
doesn &apos;t that make sense ?
so , lexi , what &apos;s it like being class president ?
i mean , you &apos;re the most popular girl in school now , right ?
oh . not really .
but it &apos;s cool .
it &apos;s a lot of work , but ...
i kind of love it .
well , i bet you &apos;re really good at it .
i mean , i can &apos;t think of
anyone who could do a better job than you .
i mean , can you , mariana ?
no , she &apos;s ... she &apos;s pretty awesome .
let &apos;s go see what &apos;s on the jukebox .
after you .
please .
i &apos;m sorry . jesus said this was your favorite place .
i &apos;m a vegetarian .
oh god .
i think it &apos;s called &quot; payback . &quot;
yeah .
so , what &apos;s your deal ? are you even happy to be out with me
or is this just some master plan to annoy your sister ?
oh , no , no , no . not at all .
i ...
i &apos;m sorry .
okay , i am stoked to be out with you . really .
you sure ?
i promise .
orders are up .
thank you .
thanks .
here you go . enjoy .
you &apos;re not ... really gonna eat that , are you ?
what , my monster burger ? please , woman .
i had my first one when i was six .
no way .
for real ?
i wanted to order it , but my dad said if i did ,
i had to eat the whole thing , so ...
so you did ? you were six .
yeah .
i threw up a couple of times .
my dad told me we weren &apos;t leaving
until i finished the last bite , so ...
maybe i shouldn &apos;t say this ,
but that kinda makes your dad sound like a jerk .
you don &apos;t know the half of it .
so , i was talking to ty &apos;s lawyer
about his hearing tomorrow .
and it turns out that he &apos;s not
just being charged with hit @-@ and @-@ run , but ...
he &apos;s also being charged with grand theft auto .
well , the truck belonged to joe &apos;s father .
i mean , unless joe got his permission ,
ty technically stole the car .
come on , stef .
we all know that ty needs to face charges for the crimes he did ,
but not for the crimes he didn &apos;t .
he &apos;s looking at up to five years .
okay . what do you expect me to do , mike ?
well , i was hoping you could speak on his behalf .
what ?
is that why you brought a.j. over to apologize the other day ?
what ?
to soften me up to advocate for ty ?
no . that was completely a.j. &apos; s idea .
okay , look , this might
help you understand why ty did what he did .
if you could just ... take a look at it .
thanks .
bye .
i don &apos;t know exactly what he &apos;s expecting me to do .
i don &apos;t have control over this .
you told me ... when i first came here
you told me that i wasn &apos;t disposable .
so , why is ty ?
callie , it &apos;s complicated .
no , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s not . it &apos;s not , really .
what is this ?
it &apos;s a date .
you said you &apos;d go out with me if you had the time .
well , you &apos;ve got 15 minutes .
come on . it &apos;s like speed dating ,
and you know it &apos;s gonna
beat that granola bar you eat every night .
right ?
well , at least they &apos;re out together .
i &apos;m not sure mariana &apos;s too thrilled about it ,
but it makes me feel better .
do ... do you want some help ?
no . i &apos;m fine .
good . how &apos;s it healing ?
it &apos;s ... you know .
it &apos;s okay . i can &apos;t feel anything below my clavicle ,
hopefully the numbness will wear off soon .
yeah . time will tell .
oh , that &apos;s interesting .
what ?
i had the guys down at the station track down gabe &apos;s record ,
and you &apos;re not gonna believe this .
oh , i think i &apos;m gonna bust .
which is what happens when you eat half a cow .
would you look at this guy ?
hey , easy .
what ? this guy &apos;s going too slow .
what &apos;s up , good looking ?
idiot .
you &apos;re not gonna let him get away with that , are you ?
come on , man , burn this fool .
what &apos;s going on ?
nick .
he can &apos;t touch you , bro .
oh my god ! oh my god ! stop the car !
stop ! stop !
what are you doing ?
slow down ! slow down !
you &apos;re gonna get us killed !
come on , baby !
stop the car right now ! pull the car over !
oh my god , you &apos;re gonna kill us !
you &apos;re gonna run a red light !
nice !
you &apos;re gonna get us killed !
stop the car or i swear to god i will never talk to you again .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
come on , we &apos;re just having a little bit of fun .
come on .
no , we could &apos;ve been in another accident .
and after all our mom is going through ? you &apos;re an ass .
hey , wait , come on . mariana .
yeah . and for the record ...
not fun .
what ?
come on , nobody got hurt .
hey , look ... all right , look , i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
please , can you just get back in the car ?
screw you .
you wanna kill somebody , it ain &apos;t gonna be us .
well , that was very tasty .
nobody ever makes me a meal .
well , i didn &apos;t make it ,
but i &apos;m glad you liked it .
you deserve to be taken care of sometimes .
mommy !
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;ve been texting you all night .
i &apos;m working .
yeah . no , i can see that .
brandon , this is eddie , my ...
mason &apos;s father .
hey . nice to meet you .
your bear .
i got called into work early .
so ?
so , you gotta take mason .
eddie , i can &apos;t just keep him behind the bar .
why not ?
you got one kid here already . you &apos;ll figure it out .
did you have a good day ? huh ? i missed you .
my ... my shift &apos;s over .
i ... i could watch him .
are you sure ?
yeah .
so ...
what &apos;s going on with your mom ?
she had a double mastectomy .
are you serious ? why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i think ...
i guess i &apos;ve just been kind of avoiding you .
it &apos;s not your fault .
when you won the election ...
i mean , you weren &apos;t even here last year ,
and you &apos;re still more popular than me , and i just ...
whenever i hear how great you &apos;re doing ,
it kind of makes me feel like a loser .
if it makes you feel any better ,
student council is seriously kicking my butt .
it is so much work .
it does make me feel a little bit better .
thank you , buddy .
i &apos;m just gonna pick this up now . that &apos;s fine .
oh no , no , no , no , hey , hey . yeah , we won &apos;t play with knives .
you know what &apos;s better than a knife ?
cookies .
a spoon . you want the spoon ?
here you go . don &apos;t put that in your mouth . it was on the floor .
here you go . spoons are much better than knives .
down !
you don &apos;t want ... you should try ...
this spoon &apos;s really fun .
it &apos;s better than the knife . it &apos;s better than the knife .
mommy !
hey , wait , wait .
hey , bud !
it hasn &apos;t all been this bad . i promise .
no , you did great .
oh . here &apos;s your spoon .
thanks .
well , they &apos;re letting me off early , so ...
i have to cut things , and knife ... cut knives , and cut things .
i &apos;m gonna get him home .
yeah , yeah , okay .
there &apos;s a big old fire .
there you go .
thanks .
do you wanna say bye to brandon ? say , &quot; bye , brandon . &quot;
bye , mason .
bye , brandon .
bye , brandon .
thank you .
bye .
wait !
hold on a sec .
oh ! oh god .
forgot his ...
oh my god , thank you .
he can &apos;t sleep without it .
you just saved my life .
brandon .
this is a bad idea .
i &apos;ve got lots of those .
mason , look who you forgot .
the defendant , mr. hensdale ,
is charged with felony hit @-@ and @-@ run ,
reckless driving , driving without insurance ,
and grand theft auto .
are you ready to enter a plea ?
we are , your honor .
we plead guilty to all charges .
in that case , we will move on to sentencing .
can i help you ?
yes , your honor . i am ms. stefanie adams foster .
i am a parent of the youths involved in the crash .
i would like to offer a victim impact statement if i may , please .
approach .
thank you .
your honor , as the victims &apos; mother ,
i certainly would like to see justice done ,
but as an officer investigating the case ,
i feel that i also must tell you that i am confident
that tyrone hensdale did not steal the truck that he was driving .
mr. olson claimed otherwise .
joe olson is afraid that
he will be charged with obstructing justice .
your honor , i brought along with me my case notes
in the hope that you would consider them before sentencing .
thank you .
thank you .
your honor , i do not feel that this was a malicious crime .
i believe that these were the actions of a frightened young man .
if i had had the experiences that he had with the justice system ,
quite frankly , i would be frightened too .
mr. hensdale first entered into juvie
when he was arrested at the age of 11
for throwing a rock into an abandoned building .
at the age of 14 , he was arrested for loitering .
at 15 , it was petty theft . the list goes on from there .
tyrone hensdale has just never really been given a fair shake .
while i am not prepared to say that i forgive him ,
i most certainly do understand why he did what he did .
that is why i am asking the court for lenience .
all right , tell her .
well , we got all the plants and materials donated ...
thanks to monte .
why ... why thanks to monte ?
because she came with me .
those guys at the garden store had no chance
once she started working her magic on them .
so , are we good ?
can this be my thesis ?
i don &apos;t see why not .
okay . i &apos;m off to class .
thank you so much for everything . it &apos;s gonna be great .
what &apos;s the problem now ?
are you gonna dig the holes for her too ?
this is totally inappropriate .
encouraging a promising student ?
expanding our community outreach ?
no . involving yourself in a student &apos;s thesis .
sally can &apos;t be perceived as getting special treatment , monte .
there are rules th ...
yes , of course there are .
but sometimes , for the greater good , we bend them a little .
you didn &apos;t seem to mind when i bent them to
get your son back in school .
excuse me , i &apos;ve got a conference call .
i &apos;ve conferred with the da , who has agreed to remove
the charges of grand theft auto against mr. hensdale .
however , in light of the defendant &apos;s previous record ,
i cannot let these additional offenses go unpunished .
i order the defendant , tyrone hensdale ,
remanded into custody for a period of 18 months .
hey , i &apos;m gonna be fine .
i &apos;ll be out before you know it .
until then , you &apos;ve got mike , right ?
he &apos;s ... he &apos;s gonna take care of you .
be good , okay ?
well , it &apos;s better than five years .
it still kinda sucks .
thanks for doing this . i really appreciate it .
no , thank callie . she &apos;s the one that got me here .
sorry i &apos;m late ,
but the hearing took longer than i thought .
how &apos;d it go ?
he got 18 months .
ouch .
yeah .
did you get to talk to justina about the bill ? what &apos;d she say ?
i did . she explained it to me ,
and i think ...
i gotta say , i think it makes sense .
so , you &apos;re gonna support it ?
that &apos;s too bad .
what does that mean ?
well , i just don &apos;t like
seeing kids being sold to the highest bidder .
no , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s not what this is , rita .
okay , so the system is broken , right ? we can agree on that ?
so , privatization is a way for us to change things up .
yeah , a really dangerous way .
i don &apos;t know why you think it &apos;s so bad .
okay , so something goes wrong in a privatized home ,
who gets the blame ? the ceo .
that &apos;s a good thing . it means that
somebody &apos;s finally gonna be held accountable .
are these your words or justina &apos;s ?
i mean , are you thinking these thoughts
or just swallowing whatever she feeds you ?
how come whenever i disagree with something ,
everybody jumps all over me ?
yeah , too bad . i &apos;m sorry you don &apos;t get it .
i don &apos;t get it ?
callie , i &apos;ve been working in the system for over 30 years .
and let &apos;s be honest , rita ... you have your own agenda .
and what agenda is that , callie ?
taking care of kids ?
no , keeping things the same to protect your job .
wow . that &apos;s what you think of me ?
i think change is hard for people ,
especially when they can &apos;t see the big picture .
say hello to the president for me .
hey , guys .
hey , what ... what are you doing here ?
why don &apos;t you guys sit down , join us ?
we &apos;ve asked ana to come
and talk to you guys about your birth dad .
look , i don &apos;t really wanna ...
jesus , i think this is something you &apos;re gonna wanna hear ,
so why don &apos;t you have a seat ?
so , your moms told me
you found out gabe was on the sex offender registry ...
which was news to me .
the reason he &apos;s on that list , it &apos;s not because he was ...
he &apos;s on that list because of me .
i ... i was 15 when i met gabe .
he was 18 . when my parents found out about us ...
well , let &apos;s just say they didn &apos;t approve ,
because he was older
and because they found out he sold drugs .
so , they forbid me from seeing him ,
and then , of course , i ran away to be with him .
they called the police , they busted down his door ,
and they arrested him for possession .
he mostly just sold pot .
well , not that that &apos;s okay , but ...
because i was underage ,
they also charged him with unlawful sex with a minor ,
and that got him labeled a sex offender and put on that list ,
which i never knew ...
until now .
so , why do you always tell us he was a one @-@ night @-@ stand ?
i guess ...
i didn &apos;t want you to think you came from a junkie
and ... a drug dealer .
i didn &apos;t want that to be your story .
hey . what &apos;s going on ?
what do you mean ?
since when do you turn away to change your clothes ?
i guess i just ...
i don &apos;t wanna make you feel uncomfortable .
okay . why would i feel uncomfortable ?
&apos;cause of everything you &apos;ve been through .
if i &apos;m being honest ...
i feel a little guilty .
guilty ... that my body is still intact .
i just don &apos;t want to make you feel worse .
you &apos;re afraid i &apos;m gonna feel ... jealous ?
no .
sorry . it &apos;s really stupid .
it &apos;s not , honey . no , it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m okay .
i am .
come sit here .
i am starting to get ...
some feeling back , right , there you are .
i can feel you right there .
for the record , you &apos;re not what makes me feel worse .
you &apos;re what makes me feel better . okay ?
i just hope she can forgive me for missing her funeral .
you did it to be with ty .
i think she &apos;d understand .
do you forgive me for telling stef ?
there &apos;s nothing to forgive , callie .
you &apos;re not mad at me ?
then why wouldn &apos;t you see me when i came to juvie ?
i was embarrassed .
ashamed , you know , but not mad .
we were just getting somewhere , then i go and take off .
i kind of figured i blew it .
i guess not .
look , i want to apologize for what i said .
i ... i was wrong .
i didn &apos;t know you , but i do now .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
come on , man , i &apos;m trying to talk to you .
look ...
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re looking for ,
but you &apos;re not gonna find it with me , all right ?
i &apos;m not your father , and i never will be .
