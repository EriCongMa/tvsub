Gossip gril here,
you're one of the resources
into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
Nate Archibald.
Can I at least get your number?
Hey, serena.
Nate.
This is Juliet.
Here you go, grandpa.
This is milo humphrey, your grandson.
We need to get our own paternity test done.
Milo's bracelet says his blood type is o-negative.
Likely, so is Milo's real father.
I've been acting like I'm okay, but I'm not.
What if I stay like this forever?
What if I never get over Chuck?
When you dragged me in from the alley,
you didn't just save my life.
You gave me the hope of a new one.
To New York? You got me a ticket?
We don't need tickets. I'm Chuck Bass.

I don't understand.
How can "gossip girl" be down
my first day at Columbia?
Maybe gossip girl get kidnapped? Unstable ex-boyfriend
lock internet tattletale in basement--
Dorota! What did I tell you?
No more watching
"Law & Order: Svu" while
you're breast-feeding.
No, unlike those plebeians at N.Y.U., the students at Columbia
actually respect and understand the power of gossip girl.
But how is my first day supposed to matter
if gossip girl isn't around to tell people it does?
Still nothing.
Good.
I forgot how exciting the first day of school can be--
a new fall wardrobe, fresh slate.
The fact that gossip girl isn't around to stir up trouble
only makes it that much more perfect.
Or she could be planning something big
for your first day. After all, the site says
"under construction," not, uh, "out of service."
What are you doing up here? I was worried.
Just looking at your world. It's magnificent.
So if you really are the big boss like you say,
can you make it so that no one comes up here and disturbs us?
I already made the call.
Well, the good thing about no gossip girl--
no Chuck.
What about you?
You're the one who has to start college
with an ex-boyfriend loose on campus.
There won't be any issues. Nate and I are still friends,
ven if he is dating some gorgeous blonde named Juliet.
Oh, please. You are Serena Van Der Woodsen.
We've been on campus-- what, five minutes?
I bet there's already
an entire frat house filled with guys fighting over you.
And don't worry. My jealousy issues are as over
as surf fabrics for evening wear.
Besides, we're carrying on
our divide and conquer strategy from Paris.
But where will our neutral meeting ground be?
Hot & Crusty will not possibly do after cafe Louis-Philippe.
But Hamilton House will.
So they do have a Columbia chapter.
You know, I always suspected Nate was a member,
but he would never fess up.
He was right not to. Their membership is so restricted
they make soho house
look like a halfway house.
So then how do we apply?
We don't.
Incoming students are selected
by an anonymous board of alumni.
If you dare to think you were chosen,
you have to find the keymaster on the first day of class.
Either a key or
white-hot shame awaits you.
Then let's go receive our new accessories.
Hello?
I'm dreading this.
As much as the truth might be a relief,
it's also the toughest thing he'll ever have to face.
Well, just be prepared. Who knows how he'll react?
He may not even believe you.
And genetics don't lie,
even though some doctors who administer paternity tests do.
I'm here. Wish me luck.
Good luck, my darling.
Hey, dad.
Is everything okay?
Is Georgina home?
No. She should be back
from her spa trip any moment.
Why? Why? What's going on?
Hey, man.
I meant to give this back to you last night.
This summer was... very rewarding, but I'm done.
You and Serena back on?
No. No, but I'm good.
I, uh, I met this girl I like.
Now if I could only get her to go out with me.
Have faith.
If a good woman can change me,
surely one can date you.
Good morning, Nate. It's nice to see you.
Nice to see you, Eva.
Everything's so different.
I keep wanting to call him Henry.
It's a long story, but it has a happy ending.
Should I make us some breakfast?
You don't have to make anything for anyone.
You can have whatever you want at the touch of a button.
Now simone is waiting for you in the spa on the second floor.
Just tell her what you'd like to eat.
She'll have it delivered before your massage... Or after.
It's entirely up to you.
This is crazy.
Your life is... perfect.
Now so is yours.
So, Henry, why do I get the impression
that you might not have told her your whole life story?
And I thought college
Was gonna be different than high school.
Who would want that?
Sorry, but this is a private club.
No has-beens allowed.
Penelope. Good to see you, too. Long time.
Clearly, standards have slipped if you're a member here.
To whom should I speak to have you removed
once we get our keys?
The wall. My great-aunt-- she was a founding member.
Nepotism.
That explains it. Now if you don't mind,
Would you direct us to the keymaster
and then get me some cashews? I'm famished.
Those two? We're so in.
Oh, no, it's her.
You know the keymaster? That's perfect.
Well, maybe.
We're here to get our keys.
Blair Waldorf, Serena Van Der Woodsen.
Hi. We've met.
I'm... Sorry. We have?
At Dan Humphrey's, with Nate.
Oh. Right. Serena.
This is why I hate it when best friends show up together.
Unfortunately, I'm down to my very last key,
which means... Only one of you made the list.
Only one?
It's okay.
We'll find a different meeting place,
like the library or bookstore or starbucks.
This key is for Blair Waldorf.
Sorry for the silent treatment, gossips.
But everyone needs the occasional r & r,
even yours truly.
Lucky for you,
I observed a sacred upper east side tradition
and had a little work done while I was gone.
Now enough with the pleasantries.
Time for the dirt.
I spy with my many eyes--
Chuck Bass returning from Paris yesterday
with a pretty, new fall accessory.
But if she's the kind of girl you bring home
to meet your stepmother, why is Chuck visiting Lily solo?
I'm so sorry. I know how much Milo means to you.
I just can't... Believe this.
Why? Why would Georgina do this? How--
you want me to stick around till she gets home?
We can talk to her together, figure this out.
No, no, I-I think--I think I need to handle this on my own.
Thanks, dad.
Also spotted-- lonely boy's baby mama
Looking like one hot mama on the beach in St. Barts.
If she's flown the coop,
Who's cleaning up her baby's poop?
And what about Serena and Blair?
It seems our girls have started their college careers
with a social call to Hamilton house.
I'm sorry, Serena, but this club is for members only.
Great. I'll see myself out then.
But if B. Is the one holding the key to the kingdom,
Guess Serena is out in the cold.
I'm sorry for what happened with Jenny.
She was in a bad place. I could've helped her.
Instead, I just used her pain
for my own self-destruction.
Thank you for the apology.
And welcome home.
Please don't disappear again.
I don't intend to.
I just hope everyone's as relieved to see me as you are.
Well, let's not ask for too much off the bat, shall we?
So tell me what happened.
I heard about the mugging from Serena, but then...
I, met someone.
Someone wonderful.
She found me, nursed me back to health.
Her name's Eva.
So when do I get to meet her?
When do you feel it would be appropriate
to introduce her to everyone?
I'm not going to lie.
You haven't exactly come home to a fan club.
But let me talk to Rufus and Eric, and,
see if I can make some progress.
I'd appreciate that.
Why don't you bring Eva to fashion's night out tomorrow?
Everyone can meet and mingle
without the pressure of a dinner.
That sounds great. Thank you.
Thank you for everything.
Serena, I don't have to accept.
Any club that'll only take one of us
is a club I don't want to be a part of.
Blair, stop it.
I would never stand in the way of your social progress.
Besides, Hamilton house isn't for me anyway.
It's much more right bank.
That's why you're my best friend.
Hey.
Okay.
First day download dinner tonight? Sorella?
Of course. I'll see you later.
That's right. It's "Sparks."
S-p-a-r--
I'm sorry. Can you hold on one moment?
Hello?
Dan, hey. Uh, we didn't get much of a chance to talk last night,
But I was...
Is that Milo I hear?
Serena, this is a terrible time. I'm sorry. Can I--
I'm--I'm gonna have to call you later. All right?
Later, man.
Nate! How happy am I to see a friendly face.
Walk me to class? I'm really lost.
Can you help me, please?
You know what? I'm--I'm running late, so... I'm sorry.
Okay. You know, it'd be really great to catch for real, though.
Blair and I are going to dinner tonight. Do you wanna join?
We could start our own club.
Un, you know what? I'm already a part of this one.
I'm gonna go head in.
I'll call you back.
Chuck is in New York?
He came to see me this morning.
Thought I would just tell you when I saw you.
Well, Eric told me first.
Apparently, it was on "Gossip girl."
You have every right to be upset with him,
But we can't undo what's already been done.
He's trying to make amends, take responsibility.
What else is there?
He met this woman who's had a big impact on him.
You can see for yourself how much.
I invited them to the party tomorrow night.
And I would appreciate
if you would just give them both a chance.
Well, Jenny keeps telling me it wasn't his fault.
Maybe it's time I believed her.
Thank you.
Okay. I'll see you soon.
What do you think of this one?
If I answered out loud,
I'd probably be asked to leave the store.
I'm afraid I have to go see my lawyer.
Apparently, disappearing for three months
isn't good for business.
But I don't know which one is appropriate for the event.
Buy them all. My card's with Leandra.
When you're finished, the car's waiting outside.
Bye.
Bye.
I don't know who's more excited that you're in the house--
The girls that wanna borrow your clothes
or the boys that wanna take them off.
Oh, well, thanks for the warning on both counts.
But I have to ask--
Why didn't Serena get a key?
It just seems like kind of an oversight to me.
I agree, but maybe it's not the worst thing in the world.
Isn't it nice to have something that's just yours for a change?
Oh. Well, I...
I have to get back to campus.
I know that you said that you had plans with Serena tonight,
but maybe you can stop by the house for a drink beforehand?
Inaugural martinis are a hundred-year-old tradition,
and so are the eager-to-please college boys.
I do hate to disrespect tradition.
Bye.
Leandra, help. I'm stuck.
Oh, hello. Blair, right?
I'm Eva.
Yeah, I know who you are.
I'm just surprised to see you here.
Oh, Chuck asked me to come back with him.
No, I don't mean in the city.
I mean in Carlos Miele.
I know. I can't believe it either.
Chuck is so wonderful.
He's buying me a dress for a party that his stepmother is--
Look, if you wanna hole up in Chuck's hotel suite
and feed him croissants, that's his business.
But introducing you to his family? My friends?
Blair, I don't--I don't wanna hurt you in any way.
Oh, you're the one that's gonna end up being hurt, ma biche,
And not by me.
Chuck will soon realize that it doesn't matter if the dress is couture
if the girl is off-the-rack.
And then, as with all things that don't fit,
you'll be sent back to where you came from.
Oh, and by the way,
if I were you, I'd wanna accessorize with some gloves.
Not even a manicure can mask those peasant hands.
And the only thing we know about Georgina's whereabouts
is that she's in st. Barts?
I called every resort I could find.
There is no Georgina Sparks staying at any of them.
She could've moved to a different island by now.
She--she could be staying under a different name.
I don't know. But she took-- she took everything, Vanessa.
She took her passport. She's gone.
She left Milo, and I don't--
I don't think she's coming back.
So we know you dated royalty.
Tell us what it's like.
Well, dating a prince isn't really different
than dating anyone else,
Except instead of flowers, you get diamonds.
Another martini, B.?
Actually, I think Penelope wants to get me a drink,
to make up for the less-than-lovely welcome.
Hey, how far are you?
I'm starving.
I am so sorry, S. I totally lost track of time.
Can you hang on a second?
Can I invite Serena?
It's club members only tonight. I'm sorry.
But don't tell her that you're here, though.
You saw her face when she didn't get a key.
I just... I don't want her to feel bad.
Where are you?
I'm just walking into my building.
The doormen are hopeless gossips.
You're not leaving, are you?
You still owe us tips on dating royalty.
Can I take a rain check, S.?
I'm feeling more like
a bubble bath and bubbly tonight.
I guess I'll just see you tomorrow.
Yeah.
Bye.
Thank you, Hamilton house.
spotted--
B. holding court at Hamilton house.
Don't worry, S.
It's not your party, but you can cry if you want to.
I was hoping I'd find you here.
And I was hoping you'd find me.
So I was wondering,
does volunteering at fashion's night out
mean you can't bring a date?
Not necessarily,
but I prefer not to mix business with pleasure.
How long are you gonna make me wait?
Serena's out of the picture.
Are you sure Serena agrees with that?
That's why she doesn't get a vote.
How about I volunteer? And then that way,
it can be work for both of us.
You don't give up, do you?
I haven't had to try this hard before.
It's... refreshing.
Were we supposed to meet up?
Last night we were,
but according to "Gossip girl,"
You had a better offer.
I'm sorry.
B., it's okay. I know you're gonna have house events.
You just don't need to cover it up.
I know. I was just drunk on gin and attention.
And Juliet told me that I shouldn't tell you
because it would hurt your feelings.
And I know I shouldn't have listened to her.
Juliet--the one who's dating my ex
and swears she doesn't remember my name?
She's concerned with my feelings now?
If anything, she's the one behind all of this.
All of this?
My gosh.
You can't believe you didn't get in.
You've never lost before.
This isn't a conspiracy, Serena.
Face it. Hamilton house just didn't want you.
I got it.
Oh, my god!
Did you just get a key?
Yep. And my mom said I'd never get in
unless I lost 10 pounds.
She's a bitch.
Eva, are you ready? We should go.
What's wrong?
You should go without me.
I thought you wanted to meet everyone.
Yesterday, after you left me at the shop, I ran into Blair.
Let me guess.
She took one look at you, radiant in a beautiful gown,
and started shredding the dress and your self-esteem.
Some of what she said made sense.
That's Blair. She wouldn't waste her breath hurling insults
if she didn't think they'd land.
She reads people, senses vulnerability.
You just need to be stronger than that.
Easy for you to say.
You're used to all of this--
the cars and clothes, the spa, the roof.
I'm not like you or Blair.
When we walk into that party,
you'll see me through everyone else's eyes,
and it won't be so charming.
It's not true.
I'm glad you're not too comfortable here.
Honestly, it speaks to your character.
It's the reason Lily will love you,
Why everyone will once they get to know you.
Okay.
I'll get dressed.
Can you...
Can you tell me all their names again?
Lily...
Lily...
Rufus...
Rufus, Eric... Serena.
You know, Elliot is the bow tie master
in our relationship,
So I guess I can't wear one now
until he's home visiting from Yale.
Well, if your mother taught me, I can teach you.
Or we can call in the true expert.
Your mother invited Chuck and his new girlfriend tonight.
She feels strongly that he's changed.
After talking it over,
I think that we should see for ourselves.
Everybody deserves a second chance.
A second chance, sure,
but Chuck's had a bunch.
After a certain point, a person's beyond redemption.
Look, this is hard for me, too.
And as upset as the Jenny situation might make me,
you just can't go writing people off.
You don't understand.
It's not like what happened between Chuck and Jenny
was an isolated incident.
What do you mean not isolated?
I shouldn't have said anything.
This is important, Eric.
What are you--what are you not telling me?
When Jenny was a freshman,
Chuck tried to force himself on her at a party.
So I don't care what Chuck says about being a changed man.
What he did to Jenny this time makes it clear.
He has always been that person, and he always will be.
I'm sorry, Rufus.
All right, we're leaving. We're not coming back here.
Well, what did they say?
That Milo would go into foster care
before he gets adopted, which could take years.
And until then, he would just be moved from home to home,
you know, with no real family,
And I couldn't even see him if I wanted to.
That's awful.
You think that's awful? There's an entire wall of photos
covered with kids waiting to be adopted.
I-I don't care if Milo's not my biological son.
He's not going into foster care.
If Georgina does not turn up, I'm keeping him.
Juliet, hey.
Oh, hi, Serena.
I actually can't talk right now.
I'm running late to go help out downtown.
Oh, come on.
Don't you think you're going a little far to hold on to Nate?
What are you talking about?
Serena, if this is about the keys,
as I said, there was only one left,
And it was marked for Blair.
Really? Because I ran into a girl
who got a key from you this afternoon.
Yes. Okay, it's true. There were more keys,
but I thought that it would be even more awkward
if I revealed that.
I don't determine who the keys go to.
The alumni committee makes that decision.
At least, they usually do.
What do you mean?
It wasn't them who didn't want you in. It was someone else.
Okay, then who?
Blair?
no, she wouldn't do that.
You were on the list until two nights ago.
And when I called to find out what had happened,
they said that blair waldorf had called
to give them more information about you,
including...
something about a sex tape...
with a guy named Pete...
Fairman?
Did you really think
that she was ever gonna let you steal her spotlight at Columbia?
Serena, I am so sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything. I just...
I would've hated for you not to know the truth.
They say old habits die hard.
Sorry.
But when it comes to Serena and Blair,
old jealousies die harder.
And even if I drop out of school,
it means I'd have to get a job. I'd have to get a nanny.
You know, what if I get one
who spikes Milo's bottle with benadryl at nap time?
I could... maybe help.
You've been great, but this is more than, like,
a-a good swaddle and formula runs.
I mean, I could move in,
And we could work it out
the same way you were gonna do it with Georgina.
And I have mostly morning classes, anyway.
Vanessa, hold on a second.
This is... way beyond girlfriend duty.
You know, you didn't sign up for any of this.
Neither did you.
And today's the last day I can withdraw from campus housing
and get my money back.
Are you sure?
If Ted Danson and Tom Selleck can do it,
so can we.
Right?
As long as it doesn't make me Guttenberg.
Hey, have you guys seen Blair?
Blair told me she was meeting Juliet at Diane Von Furstenberg.
Finally.
Nothing makes it a party
like a Serena/Blair showdown.
Prepare your cell phones, ladies.
I'd never think I would be so nervous.
Hey, I told you, underneath all the pretty,
they're all just starving wannabes. Let's go find Lily.
My husband Rufus and my son Eric.
How do you? Hello. Heard so much about you.
On second thoughts, why don't, um, we get a drink?
It might take the edge off. Would you mind?
Okay, yeah.
Thank you.
So are you gonna entertain us with another song this year?
Why don't we top off our glasses?
And we can discuss that in major detail.
Wonderful.
Rufus, Eric. It's good to see you.
Okay, I'm, uh, I'm sorry--
You got a lot of nerve showing your face here.
I thought Lily spoke with you.
She did, but that was before I found out
You tried to rape my 14-year-old daughter.
I know nothing I can do will make up for that night,
but it was years ago. I apologized to Jenny.
She forgave me. Did something happen to change your mind?
No, I just thought it was time Rufus knew the whole story
between you and Jenny.
I'm glad I did, because now I can keep you
the hell away from my family.
I understand your anger, and I'm truly sorry.
But I want you to know that I would never do anything
to hurt your daughter or anyone else ever again.
If you'll excuse me...
As a father, it's my responsibility to make sure
no one else's daughter gets hurt like mine did.
So where's this new girlfriend Lily told me about?
She should know what kind of a man you are.
Is that her?
No. It's obviously just another social climber
making a play for Chuck Bass.
Whoever she is, she's not with me.
What's going on? Flash sale on wrap dresses?
Better. Serena thinks Blair blocked her
from getting into Hamilton House and is going
"Jersey shore" on her ass.
And "Gossip girl's" streaming it live.
You couldn't stand my stealing your spotlight!
Why wouldn't Hamilton House want you?
Let's go see. I love car wrecks.
Give it a minute.
Yeah, while you were at N.Y.U.,
begging for middle class minions, I had a job!
You can't seriously be referring to your...
We can watch from here.
I learned a lot about the issues.
You mean your daddy issues.
Oh, like you're so healthy!
"I love Chuck. I hate Chuck. I love Chuck. I hate Chuck."
Oh, and who do you love?! Nate, then Dan, then Dan again.
Aaron, Gabriel, Carter, Tripp,
Then Dan again, then Nate again.
Did your father finally fix that?
'cause he seemed pretty busy giving your mom fake cancer.
I think we've seen enough.
We have to save our sister from that crazy bitch.
Turns out I'm not the crazy one.
Or the bitch.
Champagne?
Spotted--
S. and B. discovering the joys of filmmaking.
Smile for your close-up, Juliet.
No, you don't really have the Humphrey jaw, but...
my name is on your birth certificate,
so I'm gonna be your dad.
Vanessa's gonna be here, so that means
you're probably gonna be the only kid at preschool
who's seen "The battleship potemkin"
more times than "Finding nemo."
Let's hope she brought some pizza 'cause daddy's starving.
You hungry?
Oh! My sweet baby. I missed you so much.
What the hell-- what the hell you doing?
Um, I'm back from the SPA, and much refreshed.
Thank you for noticing.
Georgina, I know you weren't at the SPA,
And I know Milo is not my son.
Dan, I'm--I'm sorry. I-I can explain.
I don't wanna hear this.
You don't understand. Someone was trying to kill me.
Admittedly, your ploy to blame me
for Serena not getting into Hamilton House
Would've worked in high school, but not now.
Did you really think I would believe you over Blair?
I don't know what you're talking about...
Or what just... happened here.
We had Dorota film us earlier.
"Gossip girl" played it as a favor.
She prefers to be the only one screwing with us.
Hey, Juliet. What's--what's going on?
Serena's upset she didn't get into Hamilton House.
You purposely kept me out.
Why would I do that?
Because you're jealous of her relationship with Nate
and her friendship with me, obviously.
Whatever twisted frenemy/ex-boyfriend situation
you have going on, Serena, it has nothing to do with me.
I told you that the Alumni Committee
makes the decision--
You seriously thought
we wouldn't know anyone on the committee?
You can't. That's the "Secret" part of a secret committee.
Unless the keymaster misbehaves.
Half of the board members of Bass industries are alumni.
One phone call confirmed the obvious--
that Serena has always been at the top of the list.
Congratulations, darling.
Key, please.
Juliet.
Ladies, champagne?
Juliet!
Nate, are you really going after her?
I didn't find your little show as charming
as everyone else did.
Well, it wasn't meant to be. What's going on?
It's like ever since I got back, you're angry with me.
I-I thought we ended things as friends.
Serena, you cheated on me with dan,
and then you dumped me,
And then you disappeared for the whole summer.
And you come back acting as if nothing's changed.
But I did.
And I guess it took me until now to realize
Just how mad I am at you.
When I got on the plane to Minsk,
The guy from the bar wasn't in the seat next to me.
It was a Russian businessman named Sergi.
By the time we landed,
we were platinum members of the Mile High Club.
Oh, why am I not surprised?
We did it on the ground, too.
Um, anyway, everything would've been fine
If he didn't tell his loony wife Oksana
that I was pregnant with his child.
She threatened to kill me.
So then you escaped to Brooklyn.
But this is all just a cover,
'cause you're really a Russian spy,
Like those women in Westchester.
No. Uh, I mean, not that I wasn't approached,
'cause I was.
I came back because three guys named Boris
were paid a lot of money to hunt me down.
And then I realized if I can make oksana believe
That it wasn't Sergi's baby, she would leave me alone.
I thought you were the only guy decent enough,
At least who I slept with, to take on that responsibility.
I sent a fork to the paternity test.
It was sergi's.
I just labeled it "Dan Humphrey."
Is this all supposed to somehow be flattering?
Yes. When you signed the birth certificate,
Oksana called off her cossacks.
You saved my life and Milo's.
And to show your thanks,
you lied to me and you abandoned your son.
Look, I was free and clear on a beach in St. Barts
like a younger, hotter version of
Kathleen Turner in "Body Heat."
But I missed Milo.
I needed to come home.
I called my parents,
and we spent the last 24 hours
in an intensive family therapy session.
They're gonna let me move back in.
I-I-I'm truly glad that
you've gotten your priorities straightened out here,
but there--there's no way
that I'm letting you take this child.
I'm sorry, Dan, but it's not your choice.
He's not your son.
Georgina. What's going on?
Milo's going home.
Rufus told me what happened.
You probably shouldn't be seen speaking to me.
I explained to him that
Jenny confided in me a while ago about the party.
And reassured him that she's put the past in the past
and wants to move on.
I love you, Charles.
And if Eva is everything you say she is,
I think she will, too.
Is this Chuck's limo?
Can you take me to the hotel, please?
Hey.
I couldn't find your car. They all look the same.
Please let me explain.
There's nothing to say. I told you this would happen.
Eva, it wasn't you I was ashamed of.
It was me.
What can you have to be ashamed of?
Everything I did until the day I met you.
Look, I should've told you about my past,
but I couldn't risk losing you.
Well, I'm going now.
So tell me, who the hell are you, Chuck Bass?
Sometimes, you just have to come clean,
no matter how many dirty secrets come out.
Charlotte.
Oh, I was hoping you'd be here.
Hey, Blair.
Will I see you at my show tomorrow?
I wouldn't miss it.
Welcome home.
I'd like to say I'm glad,
but the jury's still out.
Apparently, you met Eva.
Yeah, well, I told you to come home.
I never said it was gonna be easy.
Is she still with you?
Not anymore.
Wow. She lasted two days. I'm impressed.
It was good to see you, Blair.
You didn't leave.
I'm not gonna lie.
It was hard to hear the things you've done.
But I've seen the man you can be,
and I choose to believe in that man.
Come on. Let's meet my family.
Hey. I thought you left.
I had to oversee gift bags.
Some advice-- don't get into a fight
at a party you helped organize.
So, awkward question--
Is it true you shut Serena out because of me?
When Serena walked into Hamilton House, it just...
Sort of hit me.
Your ex-girlfriend was gonna be around all the time.
Well, that's an interesting reaction
for someone who's not sure they wanna go out with me.
Maybe I'm more sure than I thought.
Once men have tasted caviar,
it baffles me how they settle for catfish.
How you doing?
Uh, I'm okay.
I'm okay, I guess.
I just talked to my dad,
and he--he thinks I should keep busy.
You know, throw myself into more traditional college pastimes,
like Noam Chomsky and beer pong.
Sounds like good advice.
Easier said than done, unfortunately.
Look, I don't want to bug you,
but the van's double-parked downstairs with my boxes.
So should I just have them take everything back to the dorm?
What do you mean?
We don't have to do this, Dan.
I mean, we made this decision
when we thought Milo was gonna be here.
I want you to stay.
Hey, I'm just curious.
Did you pack that hideous bath mat
that your mom made for you?
It's a prayer rug.
Oh. Okay.
Well, is it wrong of me to pray that it got lost in the move?
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. It'll look great here.
Come help me.
So how was it, seeing Chuck with Eva?
Harder than I expected.
But at least he's not going to Columbia.
No offense.
Yeah, I-I guess
I just didn't expect nate to be so mad at me.
I thought the only thing he got upset about
was a badly rolled joint.
But we both deserve better,
and now that we're at Hamilton House where we belong,
we'll find it.
I don't know. Even though I was right about Juliet,
you were right about me.
I did assume college would be easy.
It'll get better.
After all, you are Serena van der Woodsen.
And... You do have
the best off-campus housing of anyone at Columbia.
What are you talking about?
Follow me.
What?!
It's your new bedroom!
Oh, my gosh! Blair!
I put Dorota straight to work
the minute I got back from Paris.
You should've seen her yelling at the decorator
while Anastasia was fast asleep in the ergo.
He say you cannot get wallpaper done in time.
I simply make clear he can.
So what do you think?
Can best friends live together all year?
Of course!
Rumor has it
that S. And B. Changed their relationship status
trom besties to roomies.
Friends or lovers,
moving in is risky business.
Any time the rules change,
you don't know how they'll change you.
We take the risk
because the payoff can be so great.
But the truth is,
we never truly know who we're living with...
or the company they keep.
How are you?
Depends.
How are things going?
The guys were easy, but the girls are presenting
a little bit more of a challenge.
Apparently, sisterhood is alive and well on the upper east side.
How long can that last?
Exactly.
So you just keep your focus on not getting raped or killed.
It's a minimum security prison.
And you are hot.
Even white collar criminals get lonely.
Don't worry.
We'll get it done.
I promise.
Better watch out, kids. Trouble's moving in,
and it's looking to make the upper east side its bitch.
