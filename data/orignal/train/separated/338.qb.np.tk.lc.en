caroline , i &apos;m home !
i mean , i &apos;m hotel !
i &apos;m upstairs ,
because we have an upstairs !
thank you for losing all your money
so hollywood would buy your story
and i could buy all the pot i want .
hello , darling . you &apos;re just in time
for my big hollywood entrance .
hold up , greta garbage .
i just want to tell earl about the pot sitch out here .
he &apos;ll think it &apos;s high @-@ larious .
you never want to watch me walk .
what up , earl ? it &apos;s your girl , max ,
calling from holly @-@ weed , cali @-@ juana .
hey , max , it &apos;s not the same without you here .
a lot less customers crying .
listen to this !
they just give you pot cards out here .
all i had to say was &quot; sure , i get sad . &quot;
hey , i &apos;m an 80 @-@ year @-@ old man working at a dead @-@ end diner .
i bet i &apos;d get two cards .
is that max ? let me talk to her .
i can &apos;t find my white golf glove , and i know you took it !
han , keep your panties on .
i have no idea where your glove is .
oh , i &apos;m driving through the hills .
i &apos;m ... breaking ... up .
okay , here comes my big hollywood entrance .
hello , darling--i hope i haven &apos;t kept you waiting .
oh , my god ! are you okay ?
i &apos;m head over heels for hollywood , baby .
just put it wherever you would usually put things
for , like , a big hollywood meeting with screenwriters
who are writing your life story .
so , the counter ?
go with your instincts .
if i &apos;d gone with my instincts ,
i would &apos;ve finished nursing college .
another reason i love la ?
we just had brunch at a place where you can valet park your dog .
oh , my god , max , are those new sunglasses ?
randy got them for me .
i had to . your other pair of sunglasses
were being held together by willpower ,
and four @-@ week @-@ old gum .
can you have dinner tonight ?
ah , would that mean i have to have sex with you again ?
because the answer is yes .
max , you &apos;re going out with randy again ?
i &apos;ve barely seen you since we got here .
and i &apos;ve seen david schwimmer four times .
i &apos;ve never met david schwimmer ,
which is weird &apos; cause i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;m his lawyer .
why don &apos;t you come to dinner with us ?
would that mean she has to have sex with you again ?
because that &apos;s a yes !
actually , now i think of it ,
i can set you up with an old friend of mine .
he is big in this town .
deli @-@ sandwich- named @-@ after @-@ him big .
if you start dating a big sandwich ,
i &apos;m gonna be really jealous .
see you later ?
my boobs are down here .
wear something cute .
okay .
last time a guy told you to wear something cute ,
you said , &quot; like what ? yo nuts ? &quot;
you really like this guy .
oh , can you just not ruin this for me
by pointing out what &apos;s good about it ?
ooh , snacks .
no , don &apos;t eat those .
that &apos;s for the meeting with the writers .
writers are actors who gave up , so they &apos;re allowed to eat .
can we talk about casting with these writers ?
because for once , i want a name to play me ,
not just some lady who falls out of her tube top on &quot; cops . &quot;
hi , everybody !
sophie , i thought you were gonna be at the healer
who &apos;s gonna help you get pregnant
until well after our meeting .
well , you &apos;re wrong .
my healer had to cancel .
she &apos;s trying to get kim kardashian pregnant again .
or is it kanye ?
i forget which one &apos;s the girl .
i &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s kanye ,
because he &apos;s the one that goes crazy once a month .
this is so exciting . our movie meeting is happening !
this is exciting .
i &apos;ve never been in a hotel meeting
that didn &apos;t start on craigslist .
hi !
hi , i &apos;m leslie .
this is jason . he &apos;s my partner .
writing partner .
to be clear , i only date models .
hand models , to be clear .
come on in .
i &apos;m caroline channing .
you probably recognize me from google images .
the photo of me being dragged out of barneys crying
with my cut up credit cards is classic .
and i &apos;m max black . if you google image me ,
you &apos;ll see the canadian dude i stole my identity from .
you &apos;re hot . are you a model ?
that is so unprofessional .
right . like i &apos;m the one who has to stay
500 feet away from fred savage .
he &apos;s just so darn cute !
anyway , hi .
hi , okay , yeah . let &apos;s switch focus
and sit and talk movie .
i already came up with my character &apos;s catch phrase .
i think every time i leave the room , i should say
&quot; jigga jigga damn . &quot;
we thought it was just gonna be us and caroline ,
not that you &apos;re not fun and fabulous .
you &apos;re like a sober megan fox .
i &apos;m confused . i assumed you wanted to meet
with both of us because , you know ,
max is a huge part of the story .
stop texting . help me .
this is just a boring , preliminary , get @-@ to @-@ know @-@ you meeting .
it would really be better if--
i wasn &apos;t here .
yeah , i get it . i know when i &apos;m not wanted .
that &apos;s why i high @-@ tailed it out of my mother &apos;s womb .
anyway , i have a big hollywood meeting myself .
you do ?
uh , yeah .
i have an appointment to go stand in line
for a little thing called &quot; the price is right . &quot;
深受主妇 / 主夫的喜爱
you ever heard of it ?
ah , you know you have .
max , you don &apos;t have to go .
it &apos;s cool , it &apos;s cool .
and with that , let me just say ,
jigga jigga damn .
so , here &apos;s the thing .
your friend &apos;s character is not in the movie .
we don &apos;t have to do that &quot; jigga jigga damn &quot; thing .
to be honest , i &apos;ve never heard her say that .
nothing personal to your friend .
she &apos;s hot .
we get it !
but jennifer lawrence is interested in playing you .
and she wants to do a brave , no @-@ makeup role .
without a co @-@ star .
jennifer lawrence wants to play me ?
jigga jigga damn !
so you want to sleep over again tonight ?
think your mom will let you ?
maybe . she let me get a job at five .
you guys are sitting on the same side of the table ?
max , you &apos;ve kicked people out of the diner for that !
and it was a boy and his nana .
i &apos;ve sat next to people before at dinner .
they kind of make you at the shelter .
some wine ?
wine that &apos;s not from a box ?
that &apos;s a yes !
anyway , how was &quot; the price is right &quot; ?
did you get to meet the host , i want to say
alex sajack ?
control that temper , max .
it &apos;s drew carey , and he gets housewives wet
five days a week-- know the facts .
but i showed up too late , so i got to go back tomorrow .
i was thinking of wearing a shirt that said
&quot; one in the plinko , two in the stinko . &quot;
how about i buy you a lifetime supply of rice @-@ a @-@ roni ?
i don &apos;t think you realize how much rice @-@ a @-@ roni i can eat .
oh , there &apos;s bob .
bob ! we &apos;re over here .
oh , hey there , hot shot .
曾出演过 《 教父3 》
is that my date bob , or a different bob ?
i need that to be a different bob .
i think that &apos;s the very first bob .
it was adam , eve , and bob .
caroline , this is bob .
bob , meet caroline channing .
nice to meet you .
not a lot on top .
i hope he means i &apos;m stupid .
if me and randy are may @-@ december ,
you two are may @-@ dead .
marlon brando played the pants off the godfather .
you bet your ass he did .
at the end of the day , he was kissing my ring .
speaking of kissing , i haven &apos;t gotten one
since that time bob did heroin with the stones .
i think you mean the time the stones did heroin with bob .
getting any ideas ?
yeah , that i want to die before 60 .
anybody want to do a little blow ?
i &apos;m gonna pass .
we have to be careful , bob .
some of us are capable of dying .
i &apos;m gonna pass as well .
i don &apos;t do snorties .
even i &apos;m scared of how much talking there &apos;d be .
toot , toot . the train is leaving .
um , randy ?
it was really nice of you to set me up ,
but what the hell were you thinking ?
there &apos;s a 100 @-@ year age difference !
caroline , this is hollywood .
age doesn &apos;t matter .
unless you &apos;re a woman .
plus , bob &apos;s got a lot of connections .
he could really help you with your deal .
i &apos;m not gonna sleep with god &apos;s college roommate
to get ahead in hollywood .
i think sleeping &apos;s pretty much all you &apos;d have to do .
never got to the blow .
ran into my fourth ex @-@ wife ,
only this time it wasn &apos;t with
the moose bumper on my range rover .
you &apos;re still driving ?
what are you dolls doing in hollywood ?
you girls like a sister act or something ?
kind of . they &apos;re making a movie about us ,
so , what did the writers say ?
what did they think about zach galifianakis playing me ?
well , it &apos;s nothing personal ,
but the writers don &apos;t feel like you &apos;re ...
it &apos;s just , there &apos;s so much story .
there &apos;s a lot of characters already .
you &apos;re out of the picture , kid .
really ? i &apos;m out ?
max , i &apos;m sorry . i told them you are crucial .
but then they said maybe jennifer lawrence would play me
and i kind of blacked out after that .
hey , i &apos;ve been cut out of a lot of life stories ,
like my mom &apos;s , every time she met a guy .
i was just her two @-@ year @-@ old cleaning lady .
max , this is just the way hollywood works .
bob , you know how hollywood is .
you were there when it started .
it &apos;s cool , it &apos;s cool . randy , you ready ?
yeah , we &apos;re gonna take off before the next story , bob .
i can only hear about that three @-@ way
with gavin macleod so many times .
plus , i have to get up early
to get in line for &quot; the price is right . &quot;
i used to babysit little bobby barker .
max , don &apos;t leave . stay for another drink .
nah , i &apos;m out .
wow , you could cut that tension
with my coke blade .
max is tough . we &apos;re a team .
we &apos;ve been through a lot together ,
including a car wash that time our shower broke .
you &apos;ll be fine , kid .
you &apos;re gonna have plenty of friends
when your movie comes out ,
and for six months after that .
i don &apos;t need fake friends . i have max .
that &apos;s what wesley snipes said about jane fonda .
they &apos;re not friends .
you bet your ass they &apos;re not .
i thought you weren &apos;t gonna have time
to be on &quot; the price is right , &quot;
with caroline &apos;s big
and i &apos;m assuming boring movie .
well , my schedule &apos;s wide open .
when it comes to the movie , i pulled out .
you know , like i always tell guys i &apos;m going to .
oh , it &apos;s oleg .
i bet you he wants to have phone sex .
is there anything i can lean on ?
hey , sophie .
i was just making some baby back ribs
and i thought , i want my baby back
then i pleasured myself with an oven mitt .
so , no sex ?
&apos;cause i see a bench . it &apos;s a perfect height ,
and i can have max hold the phone for us .
is that sophie ? is she with max ?
give me that .
it &apos;s han ,
and you know sounds even shorter long @-@ distance .
max , did you play with the ringtone on my phone ?
every time it rings , it makes sex sounds .
mother .
i have to call you back .
sounds like she &apos;s doing just fine on her own .
how do i make the sex sounds stop ?
for you , it &apos;s a rare occurrence .
just leave it in your pants and enjoy it .
so , max--
sorry , han . i can &apos;t hear you .
i &apos;m driving through the hills .
i &apos;m ... breaking ... up aah ... ahh ...
i &apos;m coming , mother !
ooh , here comes the contestant picker .
act like you &apos;re a stay @-@ at @-@ home mom from the midwest .
that &apos;s the &quot; price is right &quot; sweet spot .
okay , how &apos;s this ?
oh , god .
those little bastards are just running me ragged .
pick me !
pick me !
we got a lot of 12 @-@ year @-@ old boys playing sick at home .
how long can you ladies jump up and down for ?
20 minutes .
step out of line .
what is that costume ?
oh , this is home @-@ bedazzled , doncha know ?
step out of line .
i &apos;m just glad to be out of the house .
wait here . you &apos;re both in the mix .
practice being excited to meet drew carey .
he knows when you &apos;re faking it .
my bob never knows when i &apos;m faking it .
keep it up . i like your pepper .
max ! i &apos;ve been looking all over for you .
what are you doing here ?
this isn &apos;t a scene in the movie .
i know , because i &apos;m in it .
max , there would be no movie without you .
there would also be no armed guards at hometown buffet .
what &apos;s your point ?
i would &apos;ve been here sooner ,
but i just got back from vegas with bob .
he lost $ 50,000,
and somehow faye dunaway &apos;s oscar .
but bob and i talked a lot about friendship on the helicopter .
you know , right after i jump @-@ started his heart
with the epi pen .
and you and i are not gonna be
winona ryder and gwyneth paltrow .
最终赢得奥斯卡 也失掉了好闺蜜
or sophie and gwyneth paltrow !
that bitch .
i was going to name my first @-@ born &quot; apple , &quot;
and she took it .
now i have to settle for &quot; fritter . &quot;
i am not gonna sell out our friendship for hollywood .
max , you &apos;re in the movie and you &apos;re coming with me
to the meeting to tell them that .
but i &apos;m in the mix .
they actually want me here .
but i want you there .
i &apos;m the stupid you should be with .
all right , screw it .
sophie , i &apos;m gonna go with her .
why stop making bad decisions now ?
all right , but i &apos;m gonna have to make another friend in line .
hi , i &apos;m barb .
oh , gosh , carpool and fluffernutter ...
because soccer , right ?
max , this is kind of our first hollywood party .
i know . i wonder who i &apos;ll go home with .
probably andrew dice clay again .
hey listen , this might be
the sixth teeny , tiny , tequila talking ,
but thanks for standing up for me
and not letting those writers cut me out of your life .
oh , max , that means a lot .
i love it when you &apos;re drunk and nice .
oh , no , it &apos;s han .
wonder what he wants .
you think he finally realized
i changed the outgoing message on the diner
to &quot; welcome to diarrhea @-@ ville ? &quot;
max , i heard the outgoing message ,
and i found a series of home alone @-@ style traps in my office ,
each one more fiendishly clever than the last .
and i don &apos;t know how you got those goats in his office ,
but we &apos;re having a hard time getting them out .
what &apos;s next , max ?
what will finally bring me to my knees ?
i don &apos;t know . a guy who kind of looks like a girl ?
why are you doing all of this to me ?
i just didn &apos;t want you to forget me while i was away .
oh , max .
now you &apos;ve brought me to tears .
congratulations , max .
you finally got his goat .
somebody help me !
cover those nuts .
you may need them one day .
i like that you &apos;re a bi @-@ coastal bully .
that might be our sequel .
oh , i forgot to tell you .
i invited a couple of guys over .
who ? i &apos;m kind of seeing someone @-@ ish .
it &apos;s randy and bob .
bob was real ?
i thought he was a ghost .
hey , girls . i brought some bubbly
to celebrate your victory today ,
and bob brought a wide variety of opiates and stimulants .
oh , i &apos;m glad to see you two stuck it out .
true friendship is a rare thing .
there &apos;s only one man i &apos;ve ever trusted ,
and that is anjelica huston .
holy crap !
i think god is here for bob .
is that chopper for you ?
you bet your ass it is .
i &apos;m going to malibu .
susan sarandon is ordering pizza .
we &apos;re doing molly .
bob .
will i ever see you again ?
slow down , pussycat . i &apos;m just getting out of something .
that man sure knows how to make an exit .
not from life , but from everything else .
i gotta go , doll .
bob &apos;s gonna drop me off at home .
hopefully , i &apos;ll land in my pool this time .
i don &apos;t know what it is , but
i &apos;m crazy about bob .
get it , girl .
