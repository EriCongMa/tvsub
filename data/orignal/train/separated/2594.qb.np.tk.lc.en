damn it !
david , it &apos;s me .

the network was breached .
i think they got the project files .
i &apos;m headed to the backup site with the prototype now .

good morning , ms. kaplan .
gentlemen .
oh , my god , what is this ?
vicu ? a , 100 % .
how do i get one ?
put it on your christmas list , and if you &apos;re good ...
okay .
let &apos;s see what we have here .
your ability to locate a crime scene
never ceases to amaze .
you &apos;re like a human bloodhound .
i &apos;ve been called worse .
how long ?
judging by the rate of decay ,
eight days , plus or minus .
the female died of strangulation .
male -- gunshot wound to the chest , close range .
if you &apos;d like a ballistic analysis ,
i &apos;ll need to perform a field autopsy .
as much as i &apos;d love to see that , it won &apos;t be necessary .
the whodunit has already been solved .
perhaps another time , though .
all right .
i don &apos;t want any indication that we ever set foot here ,
so please put it all back the way you found it .
of course , dearie .
how do you want to handle this , raymond ?
your phone .
911 , what &apos;s your emergency ?
i &apos;d like to report a missing person .
oh , it was supposed to be a surprise .
i &apos;m sorry , what is this ?
i can &apos;t believe you teach fourth grade
and have such little knowledge of pop culture .
i &apos;m sorry , i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
that is uncle flippo .
trust me on this ,
flashlight butt will get you some serious cred .
come on , now , let &apos;s be fair . i have cred .
oh , yeah , says the man carrying the lunch box .
mr. keen ?
detective debarros with metro p.d.
got a moment to talk about jolene parker ?
how long has she been missing ?
i was hoping you could help me with that question .
when was the last time you saw or spoke with her ?
um ... must have been last sunday , right ?
no , uh , saturday .
i ran into her outside .
she was looking for an apartment in the neighborhood ,
so i referred her to a friend who &apos;s a real @-@ estate agent .
but then she called back to say she &apos;d changed her mind
and that she was moving to dayton with her fianc ?
wasn &apos;t aware she had a fianc ?
you have a name ?
uh , no , i &apos;m afraid not .
you work with miss parker , is that correct ?
we &apos;re talking to all her colleagues .
well , she , uh , subbed for mr. sinnard
for a few weeks , but ...
were you close ?
uh , n @-@ not particularly , no .
have you already searched her residence ?
manager at the apartment hasn &apos;t seen her in about a week .
if she was planning to move , she didn &apos;t give notice .
if there &apos;s anything more we can do ,
please don &apos;t hesitate to ask .
i appreciate that . my , uh , number .
if you hear from her or anything comes up .
of course .
you &apos;re late .
sorry . something came up .
is everything all right ?
yeah , fine .
what is all this ?
just a little restoration .
of what ?
the timing mechanism for an explosive device ?
should i be worried ?
yes .
but not about this .
what am i looking at ?
a car accident .
killed the driver , nathan platt .
why am i looking at it ?
because it was no accident .
the crash was engineered by a notorious cyber criminal
known only as ivan , or ivan .
please .
and you know this how ?
i &apos;ve had some experience with the man .
he stole from me .
his brother and i spent a delightful evening
sharing stories over a plate of meat jelly
and half a gallon of vodka .
all the while , ivan had his hand in my wallet .
my job isn &apos;t to settle your grudges ,
so i &apos;m gonna need a little more than your gut instinct
that ivan was involved .
how about a confession ?
ivan took credit for the hit
in some deep , dark recess of the internet --
a place only inhabited by scary people
and reckless teenagers .
a place where curiosity inevitably kills the cat .
so , ivan ran some guy off the road .
or are you thinking it &apos;s something
a little more sophisticated ?
given his technological skills ,
he wouldn &apos;t even need to get his hands dirty .
ivan &apos;s had a very long career --
10 years of collapsing russian markets ,
selling off government secrets ,
disrupting siberian pipelines .
it sounds like his beef &apos;s with moscow .
this is the first time ivan &apos;s ever struck on u.s. soil ,
a fact that should have you all very concerned ,
because whatever he has planned ,
this is only the very beginning .
here &apos;s the information we have on our victim .
nathan gregory platt , 43,
employed at roy &apos;s tv repair since &apos; 09 .
no wife , no kids .
and no affiliation with any government agencies
or connections to russian business interests .
doesn &apos;t fit with ivan &apos;s m.o.
if i could take a look at that car &apos;s e.c.u. ,
i might be able to confirm
whether it was electronically manipulated .
do it .
aram .
what &apos;s up ?
i was wondering if you could do me a favor .
i need to pull the phone records for this number .
the name &apos;s jolene parker .
yeah .
thank you .
let &apos;s see .
inventory number 760209 .
here we are .
thanks , we &apos;ll take it from here .
hey , can i ask you something ?
why are you here ?
i &apos;m assessing evidence .
there &apos;s no shame in taking a couple days off .
i mean , if it were me , i wouldn &apos;t want to be here .
job takes my mind off audrey .
hey , guys .
this thing was definitely tampered with .
the airbag deployed before the crash , not after .
there &apos;s a message in the can bus
deliberately left here for someone to find .
what is it ?
32 bytes , 011010--
okay , translation , please ?
it &apos;s binary .
it spells &quot; ivan . &quot;
his digital signature .
what &apos;s that ?
i &apos;m not sure .
any ideas ?
looks like some kind of r.f. shielding
and a passive satellite tracking system .
doesn &apos;t look like something you &apos;d find
lying around roy &apos;s tv repair .
our victim &apos;s been moonlighting .
we should take it to the computer forensics lab .
step away from the car .
now !
get away from the car .
this area is restricted .
not to me , it isn &apos;t .
and you are ?
assistant director harold cooper .
who the hell are you ?
agent in charge , galarza , nsa special projects .
why are you detaining my people , agent galarza ?
your people had a piece of stolen technology in their possession .
everyone all right ?
case was busted open when we found it .
whatever was inside was taken from the crash scene .
what kind of classified tech are we talking about ?
unless you have ts / sci vigil clearance ,
i &apos;m not at liberty to say .
why is a special f.b.i. task force
investigating a car accident ?
agent galarza , you and i both know
this is no simple car accident .
i have information on who killed your man ,
and if you want that information ,
you &apos;re gonna have to tell me what he took .
so you can either do that now ,
or we can dance for a few hours
while i secure a warrant .
but by then , you may have lost another man .
nathan platt was one of ours --
tailored access operations technician .
which means what , exactly ?
that he didn &apos;t repair tvs for a living .
then what was platt really working on ?
this .
project skeleton key .
david fisher is our lead engineer .
he &apos;ll brief you on the details .
pleased to meet you .
the skeleton key is the culmination of five years of r &amp; d ,
into state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art cyber warfare .
it &apos;s designed to deliver a knockout blow
to enemy infrastructure in wartime .
no cruise missiles or boots on the ground ,
defense grids , weapons systems , and communications --
the skeleton key can cut through the world &apos;s most secure networks
with the push of a button .
so , you &apos;re saying our suspect
is now in possession of this device ?
a prototype for the control module .
we just finished it last week .
in fact , our whole operation was about to be relocated
to a cybercom ops center in colorado for field testing .
before it went missing .
so , the federal government has armed a cyber terrorist ,
with the digital equivalent of a nuclear warhead .
another fabulous example of your tax dollars at work .
and yet another reason why i don &apos;t pay taxes .
state &apos;s reaching out to the russians ,
but getting them to cooperate will be one thing .
and actually finding this ivan
will be a separate problem altogether .
kastrychnitski rayon .
it &apos;s in minsk , belarus .
that &apos;s where ivan is currently .
wait , when did you learn this ?
i &apos;ve always known this .
and it didn &apos;t occur to you to say something earlier ?
you fbi are such blunt instruments .
lizzy , you don &apos;t just swoop in and arrest a man like ivan .
because you know what he &apos;ll tell you once he &apos;s in custody ?
nothing .
i assume you have a better idea ?
if you want to know what ivan is up to ,
you have to get him to share that .
not because he has to , because he wants to .
how do i do that ?
we create a problem for him and then solve it .
and to do that , we need to take a field trip .
perhaps the face escapes you .
my card .
十名逃犯
allow me to refresh your memory .
grand cayman bank account
number 1210227579 .
it held approximately 5 million dollors .
and then , suddenly , it didn &apos;t .
it was a clever hack . kudos and all that .
but i &apos;ve come to collect -- with interest .
sorry , friend .
i have no interest .
i wouldn &apos;t go out there if i were you .
is that some kind of a threat ?
yes , but not from me .
seems you &apos;ve stirred up the borscht , ivan .
murdering that nsa troll got the
fbi talking to the fsb .
now you &apos;re neck @-@ deep in the beets , ivan .
they &apos;ve issued an arrest order for you .
according to my informant , they &apos;re on route here now .
of course they are .
this piroshki is delicious .
my point --
i can secure safe travel for you out of the country --
for a price .
let me guess , $ 5 million plus interest ?
thank you very much .
i &apos;ll pass .
oh , there &apos;s my cue .
you &apos;re on your own , comrade .
i accept your generous offer .
i thought you might have a change of heart .
shall we ?
$ 8 million .
i want it transferred to this account .
fine . let &apos;s get out of here .
not until i have my payment .
you can &apos;t be serious .
they &apos;re gonna be here any moment .
then you &apos;d better type fast .
okay .
done . see ?
do you find all those
little fingerprints on the glass distracting ,
or does that sort of thing not bother you ?
stop !
ivan !
you think he bought it ?
hell , i did .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t want to wake you .
what are you doing up ? is something wrong ?
jolene parker-- her real name is lucy brooks .
what ?
i heard from detective debarros . she &apos;s a wanted criminal .
what &apos;s a v @-@ i @-@ c @-@ a @-@ p ?
vicap .
it &apos;s the bureau &apos;s violent @-@ criminal database .
she &apos;s a convicted felon--
robbery , aggravated assault .
two years ago , her parole officer in santa fe
reported her missing .
hasn &apos;t been seen since .
now she shows up as a substitute teacher
in an elementary school--
i mean , how does that even happen ?
i am so sorry .
what are you sorry for ?
she was here , in our house ...
in our bedroom .
and it &apos;s because of me .
liz , that &apos;s crazy .
no . if you knew what i do ...
what do you mean ?
god , if she had done anything to you ...
come on , i &apos;m a big boy .
i can take care of myself .
don &apos;t beat yourself up .
you could never have known this .
you never really know people ... do you ?
i &apos;m gonna find her-- who she works for .
whoever they are , whatever it takes ,
i &apos;m gonna find her .
liz . uh , agent keen .
i got that information on jolene parker &apos;s phone records .
what &apos;d you find ?
you were her last outgoing call .
i was able to pull location data from the cell towers .
that &apos;s the address where she called you from--
la vista street , over in brookland .
aram , you &apos;re amazing .
so , tell me , ivan , what are your intentions ?
i assume you took the skeleton key
for one of three reasons--
some dastardly deed you have planned ,
something dastardly someone else has planned ,
or you &apos;ve lined up a buyer
and have no idea what they have planned .
i &apos;m curious , what &apos;s your price ?
honestly , i haven &apos;t given it much thought .
don &apos;t be coy , ivan .
whatever the number , i can likely double it .
you could probably use the retirement money right about now .
you have no idea what i &apos;m talking about , do you ?
the hack in d.c. , the nsa agent--
it wasn &apos;t me .
then who was it ?
i don &apos;t know , but he &apos;s been using my name .
look , my contempt is not for the u.s.
it &apos;s always been with russia .
last thing i need is a hellfire drone missile up my zadnitsa , right ?
then if you didn &apos;t do it , who did ?
whoever it is , they &apos;re very good at covering their tracks .
i haven &apos;t been able to i.d. them yet .
perhaps i could be of some assistance .
so , we &apos;ve reviewed the information ivan supplied .
it turns out this mystery hacker
has only been operating for about three or four months .
we &apos;ve linked his profile to a recent attack
on an encrypted defense network
coordinating special @-@ access programs .
that would give him intel on black @-@ budget projects .
the information alone would be worth millions .
may also be how he learned about the skeleton key
in the first place .
as if that is not enough ,
he &apos;s also hacked himself access to pay @-@ porn sites
and a pile of &quot; mythcrash &quot; gift cards ,
which is harder than it sounds .
he even breached the social security administration
to raise benefit payments for someone .
who ?
as you can see , ms. lee ,
your payments went up by $ 1,200 in september .
says who ?
social security administration .
you &apos;re saying you didn &apos;t notice the extra money ?
it &apos;s direct @-@ deposited into my account .
i never bother to check the statement .
i just balance my checkbook , same as i always do .
any idea of why these payments would have gone up like this ?
i may be old , but i &apos;m not stupid .
i know when i am being accused of something ,
and if you think i had something to do with this ,
you are mistaken .
we believe this is the work of a computer hacker .
we &apos;re just trying to figure out
what his connection to you might be .
a computer hacker ?
i can &apos;t even set my thermostat without the help of my grandson .
your grandson ?
okay , you guys will have 55 minutes .
number @-@ 2 pencils only , no pens this time .
everybody check and make sure
your graphing calculators are set to radians .
if they &apos;re not set to radians , you &apos;re gonna have a bad time .
okay . you can begin .
you have a second ?
yeah , what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m following up some leads on jolene &apos;s case ,
and i came across an address .
what &apos;s the address ?
1896 la vista street .
i &apos;ve never heard of it .
it &apos;s not her home address .
maybe it &apos;s her fiances ?
i thought i &apos;d check it out .
i think you &apos;re cutting out . hey , can you hear me ?
tom ?
the place was ransacked before i got here .
there &apos;s even a cache of burnt documents in a bucket outside ,
but they &apos;re ashes now .
you get a visual on the suspect ?
male , caucasian , over six @-@ feet .
uh ... dark hair .
excuse me .
keen .
we have a lead on our suspect .
we &apos;re heading over to lake hill high school .
okay , i &apos;m five minutes behind you .
i don &apos;t want to step on any toes , but ...
you want to be looped into the investigation ?
yeah , if you could copy me on the evidence report
once you &apos;ve catalogued everything , i &apos;d appreciate it .
sure .
bantam finance , how may i direct your call ?
i &apos;m having a problem with my account --
number delta @-@ sierra @-@ 451 .
line is secure . proceed .
watch post is compromised . bona fide &apos;s in question .
tell berlin i was forced to liquidate .
what does it say about me
that my entire life fits into six cardboard boxes ?
that you &apos;re not hung up on material things ?
or that i &apos;m boring .
do you know anyone in briargate ?
no . my dad does .
me , not so much .
first day is gonna be so awkward .
i really hate introducing myself to people .
you &apos;ll be fine . it &apos;s colorado -- free weed .
it &apos;s not free . it &apos;s just legal .
well , then , i guess you &apos;re screwed .
what &apos;s going on ?
harrison lee ?
密码
harrison lee ?
wait !
please proceed to the closest emergency exit .
please proceed to the closest emergency exit .
move , move , move ! sorry .
please proceed to the closest emergency exit .
so , how exactly does a 17 @-@ year @-@ old kid
slip through your fingers ?
he hacked the school &apos;s security system
and activated the automated evac protocols .
if you ever find him ,
ask him if he &apos;d like to earn some extra money .
we &apos;ll find him .
forensics is processing his house ,
his computer , e @-@ mails , cell records .
well , it sounds like you have everything well under control ,
which begs the question , why are you here ?
have you ever seen this woman ?
hand me that piece right there .
her name is jolene parker .
she was a sub at tom &apos;s school .
but as of yesterday morning , she &apos;s a missing person .
i found high @-@ end surveillance gear ,
a cache of documents , burner cells .
was there any evidence connecting any of this to me ?
no .
then what exactly would you like me to do ?
turns out jolene parker doesn &apos;t exist .
it &apos;s an alias .
i want to know who she is , and i want to know why the hell
she &apos;s inserted herself into our lives .
i can &apos;t answer that .
you can &apos;t or you won &apos;t ?
well , that &apos;s a matter of interpretation .
not to me .
you said there &apos;s always something you &apos;re not telling me .
just once , i &apos;d like to hear the whole truth from you .
i wish i knew the whole truth .
you know what ?
don &apos;t worry about it .
the truth is ,
i don &apos;t need evidence to connect this to you .
jolene parker is in my life because of you .
none of this happened until you arrived on my doorstep .
my life was great --
my marriage , tom .
thank god i have tom .
because with you , i never know what to believe .
i have never lied to you .
how the hell would i know ?
have fun with your project .
harrison was using some serious layers of encryption on his computer ,
but i was able to find a hidden partition
filled with terabytes of data .
who is she ?
her name &apos;s abby fisher .
any relation to --
yes , she &apos;s the daughter of david fisher ,
lead engineer of the skeleton key program .
and check this out --
she &apos;s enrolled at the same high school as harrison .
the photos look like they were taken from a webcam .
he breached her computer ,
surreptitiously watched her , and it gets worse .
he hacked into her cell , e @-@ mail , texts .
hell , he even got into her mp3 collection .
he chronicles her every move .
he &apos;s stalking her .
get david on the phone .
hello ?
mr. fisher , this is agent keen .
i need to ask you a question about your daughter .
i don &apos;t understand .
is she familiar with a young man named harrison lee --
uh , i lost him .
what &apos;s going on ?
what happened ?
i &apos;m not sure . hold on .
doesn &apos;t make sense .
all of d.c. is dark .
he activated the skeleton key .
agent keen , we got cut off . what &apos;s wrong ?
we believe abby may be in danger .
where the hell is she ?
harrison has the skeleton key in his possession .
it &apos;s how he triggered this blackout .
is there any way to track it ?
yes , if it &apos;s active .
the key uses a standard lte signal , right ?
you should be able to triangulate his location
using cell towers .
iccid : 集成电路卡识别码
you just need the imei and the iccid numbers .
no good .
all but one of the city &apos;s towers are offline .
harrison could be anywhere in this five @-@ mile radius .
how could he cause a city @-@ wide blackout
and access cellphone networks ?
the skeleton key gives him precise access
to the power grid &apos;s distribution sub stations .
he can leave what he needs up and running
while keeping everything else powered off .
we could use that .
aram , are any of the sub stations running
within your five @-@ mile radius ?
uh , one , and it &apos;s pulling a lot of power .
to where ?
it &apos;s a metro station .
green line , branch avenue .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . you &apos;ll need these .
hello ?
jackie , is that you ?
abby .
hi .
harrison .
what are you doing down here ?
waiting . for you .
okay , this is gonna sound kind of crazy .
i was just texting my friend jackie .
you were actually texting with me .
what do you mean ?
i just wanted this moment to be private .
just you and me .
w @-@ we don &apos;t even know each other .
i feel like i know you .
i know that you listen to jamestown revival
on repeat to fall asleep ,
that you bite your bottom lip when you &apos;re nervous .
don &apos;t be scared .
i &apos;m not gonna hurt you , okay ?
i &apos;d never hurt you .
can i just go home ? can i please just go home ?
is that really what you want ?
i know you don &apos;t want to move to colorado .
i know you want to stay here and finish your senior year .
you told that to jackie in an e @-@ mail .
how do you know that ?
now you don &apos;t have to move anymore .
i made that possible .
this -- it &apos;s your dad &apos;s project .
it &apos;s why he was being transferred ,
why he had to go to colorado .
how did you get that ?
i stole it .
and now they can &apos;t continue the program .
don &apos;t you get it ? you don &apos;t have to move anymore .
why would you do all of this ?
because , abby , i love you .
wait !
abby !
are you okay ?
abby , wake up .
go ! i &apos;ve got her .
abby ? i &apos;m agent malik .
paramedics are on their way to get you , okay ?
one step closer and i send this thing off the tracks .
harrison , my name is agent keen .
i have nothing to say to you .
you spent the last four months coming up with the perfect plan ,
and right now , nothing is going as expected .
all of this , it was a romantic gesture , wasn &apos;t it ?
she was supposed to fall for me just like i fell for her .
you must feel like your whole world is falling apart .
but it isn &apos;t .
we can end this .
right now , you and i.
you &apos;re right .
we can .
harrison , no !
it &apos;s too late .
this train &apos;s gonna crash .
i can &apos;t stop the train .
it &apos;s impossible to override the control system
without access to the skeleton key .
harrison , i know you feel like
this is your only option ,
but it &apos;s not .
you have a choice .
choice ?
i &apos;m a murderer .
you and i both know that the car accident was only that .
an accident .
you did not want that man to die , did you ?
this isn &apos;t what abby would want .
4 @-@ 2 @-@ 1 @-@ 8 @-@ 9 .
atcs override .
how much track does that train have left ?
about 5,000 yards .
is that enough ?
we &apos;re gonna crash .
大学校区 奇勒姆 河谷公园
what happened ? did it crash ?
i don &apos;t know .
you guys there ?
stay put . we &apos;re coming to get you .
good work .
yeah . you too .
hey , you hungry ?
tom &apos;s cooking tonight ,
so that means there will be a ton of extra food .
thanks , but i think i &apos;ll just head home .
you sure ?
liz , you have someone waiting for you at home .
you don &apos;t have to feel bad about that .
see you tomorrow .
see you tomorrow .
hey , babe .
i need some wine ,
preferably the entire bottle .
oh , no . that bad ?
hey , last we talked
you were going into jolene &apos;s apartment .
what happened ? any word ?
it &apos;s not good .
there was evidence of foul play .
foul play ? what does -- what does that mean ?
there &apos;s nothing concrete .
mpd &apos;s still processing the apartment .
yeah . w @-@ what do they know ?
do they have a suspect ?
they don &apos;t , but when i went to the apartment ,
there was someone there -- a man .
he -- he knocked me down .
what ? did he hurt you ?
no , i &apos;m fine .
are you okay ? you were attacked . liz .
the police are looking for him .
did you get a good look at him , at least ?
i wish .
just the thought of someone doing that to you --
hurting you ...
some stranger .
what do you need ?
wine .
what is this ?
be careful of your husband .
please , i didn &apos;t do anything .
i can only lead you to the truth .
i can &apos;t make you believe it .
is everything okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s just work .
you sure ?
&apos;cause i hate to break it to you ,
but after two years of marriage ,
i know that that face means you &apos;re upset .
i &apos;m fine .
i promise .
really ?
really .
you were right .
come in .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a 1940s sorrento music box .
i know this song .
when i was a little girl , i had these terrible nightmares .
i remembered ...
flashes of ...
of fire and smoke .
god , so much smoke .
my dad would lay in bed with me ...
and hold me in his arms ...
and hum that song .
he &apos;d tell me i was safe --
that everything was gonna be okay .
you spent days building that damn thing .
you knew about the song .
my father .
you knew i &apos;d find out the truth .
and you wanted me ...
to know that everything is going to be okay .
you &apos;re going to be okay .
