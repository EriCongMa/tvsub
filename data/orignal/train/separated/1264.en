...controversial author of the best-selling memoir
"Suicide Boy."
You know, I hear rumors that you're writing
an explosive follow-up to Suicide Boy.
Maybe.
作者伊森·斯莱特
Come on, Ethan! Open up!
It's me -- Juliet!
Unlock the door.
Okay, I'm dying to know
why Cavanaugh brought us all in early.
Me too. Can't be good news, right?
Maybe Angelina Jolie is playing a homicide cop
and wants to do a ride-along.
Yeah, that must be it.
No coffee? What the hell?
What?
Try some green tea.
Only 15 milligrams of caffeine.
Anybody want fresh mint for their tea?
How nice. Thank you.
No. We want caffeine.
I'm not allowed to serve coffee today.
Said who?
Morning.
Him.
I'm sure you're all wondering why I asked you in early today.
Actually, we were wondering
where the coffee is, sir.
I'm glad you asked -- 'cause the homicide squad
is taking part in "Week of Health."
Are you raising your hand?
Dr. Isles?
I'm happy to do whatever I can to support this program.
Swell.
And why is that?
Is it because 70% of all medical costs are related to smoking,
physical inactivity,
poor food choices, and stress?
Well, yes, which leads to
higher-than-average mortality rates for cancer,
suicide, and heart disease.
Maybe because somebody took their coffee away.
On average, police officers only live
two to five years after retiring.
What?
She's right.
And I'm not standing by and letting my people drop dead.
Well, what do we do?
Well, Mrs. Rizzoli and Detective Rizzoli,
I'd like to ask you to join Dr. Isles
as our wellness captains.
What?
How about a nice, big round of applause
for our new wellness captains?
Mrs. Rizzoli will provide meals,
Dr. Isles will guide us in meditation,
and detective Rizzoli will lead us in physical-activity breaks.
Why didn't you give me a heads-up?
I could have stopped at Boston Joe's!
Oh, this aggressive behavior proves you're a caffeine addict.
Well, let's just take a moment and celebrate the fact
Lieutenant Cavanaugh wants us to be captains.
He wants us to be hall monitors, Maura.
We got to go. We got a high-profile suicide.
Great! Come on, Frost.
We can stop and get some coffee.
Detective Frost?
Yes?
I'm Eric Palmer.
This is my son Bradley.
You arrested Quentin Morris.
He killed my girlfriend, Katrina.
Right. The prep-school murder out in Amherst.
I'm very sorry.
Don't be.
Quentin Morris lost his last bid for a new trial.
His final appeal was denied yesterday.
Really? It wasn't my case.
I hadn't been following it.
At least Quentin Morris will pay for what he did to her.
I'm sorry. We're late for a crime scene.
Of course. But, please, take this.
I can't accept anything.
It's made out to the Police Athletic League
in your honor.
It's a small token of our gratitude.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
25 grand? Some token.
Yeah.
What's the matter?
I don't know.
I guess -- I guess I was hoping
Quentin Morris would get one more shot at it.
Why? You think he was innocent?
Well, there was a lot of evidence
that connected him to the rape and murder
of Katrina Livingston.
Well, I remember.
Gifted black kid on scholarship out at Sudbury Academy.
That's a ritzy prep school.
He hid out in Roxbury.
State police asked us to arrest him.
So what's bugging you?
I don't know.
Maybe I just need some coffee.
Victim was a famous author.
Is his name Jules Verne?
Nice literary reference.
Do you see hints of Dickens, too?
Victim was a steampunker.
A who?
Steampunkers revere Victorian-era fashion
and technology but add a punk spin.
Damn.
It's Ethan Slater.
"'Suicide Boy' is a harrowing memoir
"of Slater's drug use, depression,
and his attempts at suicide."
Sounds good.
Look at you, going all gen "Y."
It was a best-seller.
Made Slater rich and famous.
You find a suicide note?
Yeah.
His editor found his body.
The note was in the typewriter.
She was coming by to collect the manuscript
for his new book.
"I can no longer live with the lies."
So, what's in the new manuscript?
Wasn't here.
Slater wrote his books on this manual typewriter.
You mean there was only one copy?
This is dope.
What? What is it?
Looks like a laptop in a steampunk case.
Phew. I'm glad he wasn't too retro-cool to own a computer.
This is an unusual knot.
It's an alpine butterfly bend. I use it on my boat.
It's not an easy knot to tie.
The ligature marks on his neck are inconsistent with a suicide.
Are they consistent with a homicide?
Okay, I'll make it easy for you.
Door number one -- suicide.
Door number two -- homicide.
Door number three -- suspicious death.
Thank you for playing
the "Annoy the un-caffeinated detectives" game.
I thought you stopped for coffee.
Line was too long.
Looks like Ethan only used his computer for e-mail.
So where's the manuscript?
So, there are the 10 tips to de-stress.
Here, take that.
What are you doing, ma?
Oh, ladies,
please empty your pockets of any unhealthy snacks.
Maura, here is your mid-morning snack.
A quinoa wrap? Barf.
Oh, look.
A smiley-face sticker.
Why do I have a sad sticker?
Because a bad attitude is bad for your body.
Well give me the bad-ass sticker, then.
Frost had a doughnut this morning.
What's gonna happen to him?
Excuse me. Detective Frost?
I'm Vonda Morris,
Quentin Morris' mother.
I heard his appeal was denied.
I'm sorry.
My boy didn't kill that girl.
I can't imagine how difficult this must be for you.
You're a good man.
And that's why I'm here. I need your help.
Please. You have to look at the case again.
Mrs Morris,
the crime occurred outside our jurisdiction.
It was a state police investigation.
You met Quentin. You talked with him.
Yes, I did. He had so much going for him.
I'm really sorry.
I know he didn't kill that girl.
Somewhere inside, you know it, too.
The evidence against him was overwhelming.
There's really nothing I can do. I'm sorry.
You can't change the evidence, Frost.
There's a sticky substance alongside the ligature marks on his neck.
I'll have trace run tests.
That old prep-school case is really eating away at Frost.
Tell him to take probiotics. It's good for anxiety.
It's time for your five-minute meditation.
Turn that off. Please.
Meditating lowers stress. It improves focus.
I don't want to have to report you.
Report me?
You're gonna report me?
Well, I have to
- Lieutenant Cavanaugh insisted.
Okay. 50 push-ups.
Now. I don't want to be forced to report you.
Is this a bad time?
Not at all.
The victim's blood-alcohol results are back.
He was pretty intoxicated -- .18.
Poor guy was out of it when he killed himself.
The pedicles of both c-2 vertebra were intact.
It wasn't a hangman's fracture.
What does that mean? It's not a hanging death?
Well, I'd expect to see an injury
from a sudden, forceful hyperextension.
This is an asphyxiation.
Okay, I haven't had any coffee,
so can we stick to "Strangled" Or "Hung"?
Try again.
Strangled.
Good.
Then hung.
Why me?
Maura.
The splinters on the beam should be pointing in the opposite direction.
If he was hung.
If he was first strangled, then hoisted up in the air...
the splinters would look like this.
"Suicide Boy" was murdered.
What's yours say?
Mine's 140 over 90.
Huh. That's the same as mine.
Frost, that's not good.
Oh, but it's fine for me?
He's uptight about the Quentin Morris case.
Oh, I heard the kid lost his final appeal.
That what's got your blood pressure up?
His mother was here putting pressure on him.
Thinks her son's innocent.
Oh. That's tough.
Maybe I should have done more.
Like what?
I don't know.
Frost, take an hour to go through the case.
It'll make you feel better.
As your wellness captain, I insist.
Nah.
Now that we know it's a homicide,
the Slater case takes precedence.
I got to give it to this kid. He sure could write.
We need that manuscript he was working on.
Frost, is there anything in his phone records?
He was the only person in Boston without a cellphone,
But at least he sent a lot of e-mail.
Lots of correspondence with his editor,
Juliet Randall.
What do we know about her?
She's based in New York.
Says she came to town yesterday to pick up the manuscript.
Did you confirm when she arrived?
No. Thinking maybe she drove.
She wasn't on any flights.
I think maybe she and Slater were lovers.
The e-mails between them are pretty cozy.
Check out this photo she sent him.
All right, this is interesting --
Slater dedicated his book to
"an editor I would sail with on any sea."
Juliet Randall is a member
of a sailing club.
Bet she could tie an alpine butterfly bend knot.
Slater sent Juliet an e-mail three months ago
saying the manuscript was finished.
So why is she just coming in now?
Okay, we need to talk to her.
I sent Frankie to her hotel to bring her in.
Nice!
It's physical activity time!
No, it is not.
I'm going to kill her.
That should fulfill the physical activity time for today.
Glad to hear you're leading everyone, captain Rizzoli.
Yes. Yes, sir. Yes. Everybody up!
Stand up. On -- on your feet!
Because... we are...jogging!
We are jogging in place. Doesn't that feel good?
Detective rizzoli? - We are jogging. Yes. Isn't --
Janie!
What? God.
Brought in your suspect.
When you've finished with your calisthenics,
maybe you want to talk to her.
Thank you.
Stop!
I'm telling you, I don't know where the manuscript is.
You came to boston to get it, though, right?
Ethan called me two days ago.
Said that if I didn't show up, he would burn it.
Sounds like he was angry with you.
It was mutual.
He was three months past his deadline.
Were you romantically involved with Ethan slater?
Not really.
"Not really"?
Look, it was never... anything.
We think you came to boston
to make sure that Ethan didn't burn that manuscript.
And then when he wouldn't give it to you,
you staged his murder to look like a suicide.
Suicide boy finally does it.
Bet that would be good for sales.
You're wrong.
I flew up early this morning,
and I went straight to his apartment.
He was dead when I got there.
That's funny -- your name isn't on
any flight manifest.
I flew up on a private jet.
We'll need that tail number.
Of course.
Ethan was a brilliant writer.
I really hope that his manuscript wasn't lost.
The tail number, Ms. Randall.
Detective Frost. Come in.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
Would you like to join me in a meditation?
Actually, I was wondering if you could take a look
at an old autopsy report.
The prep-school murder.
Jane mentioned that you were concerned about it.
Quentin Morris' DNA
was found on the murder victim, Katrina Livingston.
An eyewitness testified that he left her dorm room
around the time she was raped and murdered.
You'd like me to review the autopsy?
Yeah.
I don't know why I'm worrying about this now.
Do you identify with Quentin?
I was one of three black kids at an elite, all-white prep school.
I just keep thinking that with so much evidence
against one kid who didn't belong,
maybe they didn't look any further.
I'll look through this.
Would you look at my interrogation of Quentin, too?
What am I looking for?
Something I'm not seeing.
I haven't thought of this case in two years.
Why am I sweating it now?
It doesn't matter why, Frost.
If there's something to find, you and Maura need to find it.
Could be nothing,
But my gut's been jumping all day.
Yeah. Mine, too.
Maybe it's because of these dried beets.
Yuck. Ugh. Have you tried this stuff?
It tastes like sweat and rotten celery.
Stop drinking it.
And stop drinking your own sweat, too.
Jane?
Something's going on with ma.
Maybe she ate too many chia seeds.
Jane, she's growing herbs.
Did you spot cannabis between the basil and the rosemary?
She hasn't gardened since pop left.
Oh, no. I hope she's not
enjoying her life again.
Okay, she's suddenly interested in lip balm,
And she asked me if the pants she was wearing
made her look fat.
That is bad. No, that's a bad sign.
I told you.
You can stop pretending like you're working, Korsak.
You're screwing around with the book.
Oh, yeah? Listen to this.
"I met Sadie in a suicide chat room."
What the hell is wrong with kids these days?
I'm waiting to hear the "Working" Part.
"Sadie was into steampunk and suicide, too.
"We made a pact to end our lives.
We said goodbye in the chat room that brought us together."
Slater tried to kill himself as part of a suicide pact?
Yeah. And according to his book, Sadie was successful.
Well, maybe somebody close to Sadie
blames "Suicide boy" for her death.
No record of any "Sadie" Committing suicide in Boston
in the last two years.
Maybe Slater made her up for dramatic effect.
Yeah, like that guy on "Oprah"
that wrote that fake memoir.
"Oprah"?
What, I can't have a sensitive side?
Maybe Slater changed Sadie's name so he wouldn't get sued.
Oh, he did.
"Names have been changed
to protect the not-so-innocent."
Frost, look up Slater's 911 call
for his attempted suicide two years ago.
See if it's still in the system.
Found it. February 12, 2010.
911. What's the emergency?
I need an ambulance. I slit my wrists.
I'm bleeding!
Any other suicide calls that day?
Well, someone reported a suicide -- Kevin Baker.
911. What's your emergency?
I'm at 5392 Stone Avenue.
Oh, my god!
My sister -- she -- she slit her wrists.
Tamara!
Oh, my god.
Here's the police report.
Tamara Baker, 19.
Her brother found her body.
She was a steampunker.
Maybe Tamara Baker was Sadie.
Running Kevin Baker's name.
Check out her brother's website.
I'm thinking maybe her brother Kevin blamed Ethan Slater.
Looks like Kevin holds a grudge.
Frost, click on that video link.
Suicide is not something you --
you write about and make money off of.
This sick, punk coward took my sister from me.
Here's what I think about him and this piece of trash.
I hope he burns just like it.
Only 40 views.
Kevin didn't find much of a sympathetic audience.
Must have pissed him off even more,
when "Suicide Boy" sold five million copies.
Let's bring him in.
What? Maura's got something?
It can wait.
Frost, go. We got this.
State Police are on their way, Quentin.
You're looking at murder.
Murder? Look, this is crazy, okay?
I did not murder Katrina.
Now, I don't know what they're saying they found,
and I get why Sudbury Academy thinks it's me,
but I didn't do this!
Both of Quentin's upper eyelids droop slightly,
his eyes lose focus,
the corners of his lips pull down.
Okay, so, what does that mean?
Quentin's micro-expressions
indicate that he was under great duress.
He was about to be charged with murder.
It's not fear projected on his face.
That's anguish. Grief.
There's something you're not telling me, Quentin.
You got to believe me, detective, okay?
I didn't do this.
Then give me something I can work with, Quentin.
Me and Katrina were together.
Okay, nobody knew but her homegirl Ann.
All right, just ask Ann. Please.
Who is Ann?
Katrina Livingston's best friend.
She lived across the hall.
She was the commonwealth's star witness.
Is the person you saw exiting the victim's room
in the courtroom?
Yes. That's him.
Let the record show
that the witness has identified the defendant.
Did Katrina ever tell you that she had
an intimate relationship with the defendant?
She was going out with Bradley.
And Quentin took her from Bradley, from all of us.
She doesn't answer her question.
You're right -- she dodges it.
Her face also exhibits hot spots.
She's attempting to convey anger and disgust,
but her raised, drawn-together eyebrows
indicate that she's masking deep fear.
Quentin begged me to talk to Ann.
She was probably terrified
by the time the state police got to her.
Well, it wasn't your case, Frost.
It still isn't.
What do I do, dr. Isles?
Pursue the truth.
Ann has more to say.
I'm sorry about your sister's suicide.
It wasn't a suicide. Tamara was murdered.
The police report says she slit her wrists.
Are you saying she didn't do that?
I'm saying Ethan Slater got in her head
and talked her into killing herself.
She's bleeding out, he's calling for help.
That's murder.
She dies.
He lives and makes a fortune writing about her.
So you took justice into your own hands.
Your sister killed herself,
you killed Ethan Slater.
No, I wish.
I've fantasized about killing that bastard a million times.
Slashing that punk across his stupid face --
I dream about it.
Sounds pretty real to me, Kevin.
I wish it had been me.
I wouldn't have let him go so easy.
But I didn't do it. I got an alibi.
Yeah? Where were you last night?
30 stories in the air.
I'm a crane operator.
I work the graveyard shift. You can check it out.
Close your eyes.
How much longer?
You're insufferable.
Are we there yet?
Just quiet the chatter in the monkey mind.
Inhale deeply through your nose.
Exhale.
Did you hear that?
Try not to attach to the ambient noise.
No, it sounded like it was coming from
right outside the guest house.
Maura! Maura!
Ma, what the hell's going on?
He fell. Hurry, please!
Uh, no!
Ma!
Sean! Sean.
Oh, my god. Is that Cavanaugh?
Jane, call 911.
NO! NO!
No?
I said no.
That's an order, Rizzoli.
Angela, get me a towel.
Okay.
And his pants, too, while you're at it.
What the hell happened to me?
It appears you experienced a vasovagal episode.
I went outside to get some air.
You live in Dorchester.
I got light-headed is all.
Is that how your pants fell off?
Jane, don't embarrass him.
Him? I've never been so embarrassed in my life!
Well, your dizziness could have been caused by sexual arousal
and the sudden rush of blood to your genitals.
Oh, my god.
Okay, we weren't making love.
We were just making out.
I'm gonna have a vasovagal episode if you don't stop.
Please. I beg you.
You should go to the hospital.
No!
Maybe you could just stitch his head up?
Well, we need to know what caused this.
When was the last time you ate, Lieutenant?
Well, he got his meals at the caf?
Same as you two.
I might have skipped lunch... and dinner.
You said my healthy food was sensational and delicious.
He meant your healthy food was silent and deadly.
Well, a butterfly bandage might close this up.
So how long have you and my boss been seeing each other?
We are not going there.
You are in a slip,
and my boss is on my best friend's couch in his underwear!
What do you have to say for yourself?
Well, I still think you need to be seen in the E.R.
No.
Look, no one else can know about this incident.
You know what? I'm just gonna get in my car and go home.
All right, at least let me drive you home.
Please tell me I'm asleep and that was a dream.
Okay. Come on, guys. Like 20 more seconds.
I think I've gained two pounds on this program.
Do you think I'm building muscle mass?
Well, I'm sure it's not the doughnuts
I saw in your desk drawer.
Oh, I saw you eating a contraband doughnut this morning.
You wellness snitch.
Nice jogging, Rizzoli.
Thank you, sir.
What happened to your head?
Oh, I slipped and fell.
So, where we at on the Slater case?
Uh, well, both the suspects have alibis.
So nowhere, really.
Slater used pseudonyms for all the drug addicts
and chat-room suicide folks he wrote about.
Okay, so run them down, people.
What's going on with him?
Too many whole grains?
I'm thinking that old dog got some last night.
You guys got to hear this.
You know, I hear rumors that you're writing
an explosive follow-up to "Suicide boy."
maybe.
We all have to stop hiding and do the right thing.
That's all I can say right now.
Maybe there was something in his second book.
Maybe he was gonna reveal something that got him murdered.
"I looked down at the blood flowing from my wrists
like a river.
I let it pool in my lap.
It took nearly dying to figure out I wanted to live."
Where did Slater go after he was treated at mass general?
After Slater was discharged,
he did 90 days of rehab at the Breyer mental health center.
Maybe he met somebody there --
somebody who didn't want their story in his books.
Who runs it?
A Dr. George Breyer.
I'll poke around.
Is it okay if I go talk to Maura about the prep-school murder?
Yeah, Frost. You don't have to ask us. Go.
Detective Frost, this is Ann Stephens.
Thank you so much for coming in to talk to us about Katrina.
I'm not really sure why I'm here.
I already told the jury everything I know.
We just wanted to ask you a few questions about Katrina
and Quentin Morris.
He murdered her. I testified.
I have nothing else to say.
We think you're holding something back.
Whatever it is, it's still bothering you.
Now's the time.
I'm not.
His attorney did this to me, too.
Your body is giving you away.
There's something you're holding back.
I warned her.
Katrina? You warned Katrina?
But she wouldn't listen.
She'd already fallen for him.
He wasn't really one of us.
I told her not to let him in her room.
You mean Quentin?
Yes.
So they were involved?
Yes.
Why didn't you tell anyone that?
Because then I'd be helping him get away with it.
You mean Quentin?
He beat my best friend to death.
What if he didn't?
I saw Quentin leave her room.
I went to the bathroom, came back, and found her body.
He killed her.
I mean, who else could have, right?
When are we getting coffee back?
You'll thank me when you're old.
I'm not interested in getting old
if all I get to drink is green tea.
Hello.
Hi, Sean.
Thanks, Mrs. Rizzoli.
I, um...I gave you potatoes instead of quinoa.
You said you've missed your potatoes.
I don't deserve the special treatment.
Yeah, you do.
Look, Angela, you're a wonderful lady.
But?
But I got a job to do here.
And I should have never started this.
I'm sorry.
Ma, please tell me that you and Cavanaugh...
You're my mother! What are you doing?!
Before I was your mother, I was a person.
And what's so wrong with wanting to be a person again?
Do you want me to punch his lights out?
No!
Thanks. Dr. Breyer is missing.
Ethan Slater's doctor?
He left yesterday for London to speak at a conference.
Never got on the plane.
Frost, see if you can track down Dr. Breyer via his phone's gps.
On it.
His assistant, Chad, was the last person to see him.
He thought Dr. Breyer took the "T" to Logan.
I have Dr. Breyer's final gps coordinates on his phone.
When were they transmitted?
Yesterday afternoon.
Dr. Breyer never left Boston.
Signal's coming from a construction site
by a medical center -- right here.
Looks like we're getting closer.
Somewhere around here.
Dr. Breyer was getting a brand-new wing
for his private rehab hospital.
I don't think Dr. Breyer
is gonna get to enjoy it, though.
Well, he either jumped or was pushed.
I think it's a piece of a document.
Looks like he might have been holding it.
Well, if he jumped, what's he doing holding a piece of paper?
Do you know which occupation has the highest suicide rate?
Homicide detectives while they wait for autopsy results?
No. Physicians.
Our suicide rate is nearly double the national average.
It's even higher than dentists.
Maura, is this some kind of cry for help?
Yes, if you meditate with me,
you will greatly improve the quality of my life.
Were you one of those girls that needed another girl
to go with them to the bathroom when you were in 7th grade?
Of course not.
Well, then I'm sure that you can quiet the monkey-mind chatter
all by yourself -- I know you can.
In every suicide that I have ever worked,
the jumper took his glasses off first.
I think Dr. Breyer was pushed.
I may have found some trace evidence to support your theory.
Sharing is caring.
There's a sticky substance on Dr. Breyer's right hand.
It could be the same substance that you found
on Ethan Slater's neck.
Have you gotten those results back yet?
Trace is still working on it.
It must be from the killer's gloves.
Maybe Breyer shook hands with the killer.
Call me when you find something, okay?
All right.
That little scrap of paper we found near Breyer's hand
was from the corner of a personal check.
Any idea what bank issued it?
Not yet. Susie's working on it.
I'm gonna guess that somebody lured Dr. Breyer
up to his new wing with the promise of a big payoff.
Well, Slater's murder was staged to look like a suicide.
Then the killer steals his manuscript.
Then kills Dr. Breyer? Why?
Well, Breyer treated Slater in rehab.
Maybe Dr. Breyer knew what Ethan Slater was writing about.
So the good doctor blackmails the killer
by offering to keep quiet for a price?
Oh, I sent Frankie to Breyer's center to get the records.
I found seven patients who were hospitalized
at the same time as Slater.
Nice, Frankie.
Okay, uh, rock-star drug addict.
Died last year of a drug overdose.
Suicidal Brahmin shipping heiress.
Back in treatment.
The other five are living healthy lives
in other parts of the country.
You know, I bet if we find Slater's manuscript,
we'll find his killer.
Frost, what's wrong?
I went over the prep-school murder case files again.
Thought I might discover something after questioning Ann.
No one but Quentin enters or exits Katrina's dorm room.
Maybe Ann was right.
Maybe Quentin did kill her.
Why don't you take a couple hours, Frost,
drive out to Amherst?
Yeah. Take a look at the crime scene.
See if the state police overlooked anything.
Nah. Nah. I'm done.
I've been too consumed by this.
Frost, you're no good to us until you can focus, okay? Go.
Jog there if it makes you feel better.
Who's texting you?
别告诉简 --安琪拉
Oh, new C.I. I'm working with.
I need some dating advice, Vince.
Full disclosure -- I've had three wives.
I'm not much help in the dating department.
But you've known lieutenant Cavanaugh for a long time.
Where's this headed?
We've been seeing each other.
Well, we were.
Let me guess. He broke it off.
How'd you know?
You said it -- I've known him a long time.
Tell me, Vince,
otherwise I'll have you eating this health crap forever.
Back when we were rookies,
Sean lost his wife and baby son in a fire.
I don't think he's even had a serious girlfriend since.
Well, that explains some things. I...Oh, I wish he had told me.
I have never heard him talk about it.
Hi.
We're still working on the piece of paper.
Latent prints went over the typewriter,
but it's just the victim's prints.
Thanks, Susie.
Wow. A typewriter. Makes me feel old.
No, don't feel old.
A very young victim liked writing books on one.
It's an old Underwood.
I used to have one.
I used to type up plumbing invoices for Frank Sr.
Changing those typewriter ribbons was such a mess.
Typewriter ribbon.
Angela, you're a genius.
Mention that to your friend Sean.
Jane, meet me downstairs in the crime lab.
My new C.I. may have just offered up
a breakthrough in the case.
A 1930s Underwood model five.
Jack Kerouac used to use one just like it.
How in the world do you know that?
Well, I saw his typewriter on display
at the Lowell National Historical Park Museum.
We're in luck.
Slater's typewriter uses a single-pass carbon ribbon.
That's good news.
Yes, it's the most wonderful news I've ever heard.
Why do we care?
Well, some older typewriters use fabric ribbon,
and those don't retain a retrievable, legible text.
But with a carbon ribbon, each keystroke makes a mark.
We write down the characters,
then figure out where the breaks go between the words.
It'll take awhile.
The trace results on the sticky substance
from both the victims is back, Dr. Isles.
Thank you, Susie.
What is it?
Balsam fir sap.
The same sap that was on Ethan Slater's body
and Dr. Breyer's body?
All right, well, don't look so surprised.
We're looking for one killer.
Yeah, but fragments of solidago macrophylla.
What? What is it?
These are the M.E. files that Frost asked me to look at.
The prep-school murder?
Yes, and they have the same balsam fir
and fragments of solidago macrophylla.
Yeah, it was found in Katrina's closet.
Yeah, but it wasn't considered significant
because Katrina was a rock climber.
It still isn't.
Balsam fir trees are common all over the northeast.
But solidago macrophylla isn't.
It's unique to the summit of Mount Greylock
in the Berkshires.
So whoever killed Katrina, Ethan Slater, and Dr. Breyer
would have to be a skilled climber
to get to the top of Mount Greylock.
I'm glad I took your advice and drove out to Amherst.
Okay, if that grappling hook
is for the wellness program, you can count me out.
I am not a fan of heights.
Aww, I thought we'd take Korsak and climb Everest.
Okay, maybe Everest.
I want to show you something I found
when I was looking around Katrina's old dorm room.
Okay.
This is the building's exterior.
You see those marks?
Yeah. You think those are from a grappling hook?
Yeah, I do.
I think that's why no one saw him
and why Quentin was the only one
on the hallway security tape.
So Katrina's killer climbed the wall
and went in through her window.
Now, check this out.
Oh, that's the guy who stopped you
in the lobby with his father.
Bradley Palmer, right?
Yeah, he was Katrina's boyfriend.
They used to lead climbs together
in the White Mountain National Forest.
You see that?
Alpine butterfly bend.
That's the same knot used to hang Slater.
I sent Frankie to Slater's building.
He took some photos of the building's exterior.
Grappling marks.
He got into Slater's apartment the same way.
But here's what doesn't make any sense --
what is his connection to Slater and Slater's rehab doctor?
Dr. Breyer? I have no idea.
It's Maura. She says we need to get down to the crime lab.
What's up?
Slater was a terrible typist with bad grammar.
Look at this -- he uses "who" instead of "whom,"
"which" instead of "that."
Well, no wonder somebody killed him.
Here's what's odd --
Ethan Slater started typing the last page of his manuscript
three months ago.
So what was he typing for the last three months?
All kinds of things -- letters, poems, essays.
Not one word of this manuscript
until right before he was killed.
Well, do you have that last page?
We certainly do, thanks to Sergeant Korsak.
No, no, thanks to you, Dr. Isles.
Oh, please, sergeant.
I couldn't have done it without your help.
Okay, we'll throw you both a parade later.
What does it say?
"He told me after a group session
while he ate a turkey sandwich
that he'd beaten Katrina to death
because she cheated on him."
Slater's talking about Bradley Palmer,
Katrina's boyfriend.
Yes, he was.
And this was the last sentence that he typed.
"Bradley Palmer showed up the same day I did
at Breyer Mental Health Center,
but I'd take my suicide attempt over what he did.
He killed his girlfriend."
Damn.
And Slater and Dr. Breyer to keep them quiet.
But why now? Unless...
Frost, did Quentin have any legal proceedings
three months ago?
Yeah. His final appeal hearing, but it was postponed.
Till yesterday. That's why now.
Slater must have hoped Quentin would get a new trial.
And when he didn't,
Slater made sure that book was ready to go
if Bradley didn't come clean.
Eric Palmer gave me this check.
What do you think?
It appears to be the same stock and design.
Nice.
Detective Frost, oh, nice to see you.
Would you and your friends like to try our wall?
We had it set up for our employees to build team skills.
Ethan Slater told you that if you didn't tell the truth,
he would tell it for you in his second book.
What's this about?
Oh, I think you know, Mr. Palmer.
That's why you hid your son at a fancy rehab center
after he killed his girlfriend.
That's ridiculous.
Is it?
Is it also ridiculous
that your son climbed up the side of his girlfriend's dorm,
hid in her closet, and beat her to death
after he caught her with Quentin?
Y-you can't prove anything.
Bradley!
Quentin Morris was convicted.
I think I'm just gonna call our lawyers.
Do you pay your lawyers with a personal check?
Eric Palmer, you're under arrest for accessory-after-the-fact
in the murder of Katrina.
Dad, dad, you got to do something.
Bradley Palmer, you're under arrest
for the murders of Ethan Slater, Dr. George Breyer,
and Katrina Livingston.
Look at that. Quentin Morris' mother.
It's amazing.
Her son was going to a prison
for a murder he didn't commit.
Now he's coming home.
How long until Quentin gets released?
He should be home by the end of the week.
Bet your blood pressure's a lot lower now, huh?
I always thought the greatest feeling in the world
was putting away bad guys.
It's not?
No.
The greatest feeling in the world
is freeing an innocent man.
Nicely done, Frost.
All in all, a fine day for the good guys.
Clearing three murders --
that's a whole lot of wellness, right?
I wonder what happened to the manuscript.
I'm guessing it went to a shredder
at Palmer Industries.
I don't think anybody ordered a red wine.
Actually, I did.
What?
Well, it's like Maura's always saying --
the resveratrol in red wine is excellent for cardiac health.
You actually listen to me?
Most of the time, yeah.
Well, this deserves a toast. Salud!
Salud! Salud! Salud! Salud!
Salud.
