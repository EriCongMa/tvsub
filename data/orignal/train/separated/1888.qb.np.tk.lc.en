can two people really be meant to be ...
and i had to rearrange some of your surgeries .
m.f.e.o. ?
check the o.r. board for any changes .
soul mates ?
i have one last thing to say .
some of you , uh , may run into arizona robbins today .
it &apos;s her first day back .
so if you see her , just make her feel welcome .
or maybe ...
maybe just don &apos;t make a big deal at all .
it might be better .
noted . thank you .
oh , oh , hold on . i just want to address one more thing .
um , most of you are aware that a group of our doctors
have filed a lawsuit against our hospital .
some of you may be wondering what this all means
and how it &apos;s gonna affect our staff .
i &apos;d like to be clear .
it doesn &apos;t ... at all .
let &apos;s just let the lawyers worry about that .
that &apos;s their job .
our job is to continue to work together
and support each other in giving the great standard of care
that we have always given .
let &apos;s not let something like this get in the way of that .
thank you .
it would be nice if it &apos;s true ...
that we all have someone out there waiting for us ...
us waiting for them .
that was good .
anything else ?
uh , yeah . um ...
the fire house .
i &apos;m not staying there anymore ,
so i was wondering what we should do .
i mean , if we should sell it or ...
i wondered what you wanted to do .
you should do what you like .
it &apos;s your house .
i &apos;m just not sure i believe it .
red eagle has landed .
what ?
arizona just got here .
i had an intern wait at the entrance
and then text me when they saw her .
i also put the weirdo over there on wheelchair duty .
now listen , she &apos;ll be tired and in pain
but she won &apos;t ask for it unless she sees it &apos;s close by .
just don &apos;t shove it ...
in her face . she hates that .
you know what i hate ? that you won &apos;t stop talking .
well , then you two will get along just fine today .
oh , red eagle .
red eagle . don &apos;t--don &apos;t-- don &apos;t look up .
don &apos;t look up . don &apos;t look up .
keep reading , yeah .
hi .
robbins .
oh , hey . good . you &apos;re here .
well , i gotta run .
derek &apos;s all &quot; fix my hand . &quot;
&quot; no rest till i &apos;m healed . &quot; rawr .
we got a big schedule .
uh , there was a 9 year old that came in last night
with abdominal pain ,
uh , a 6 year old with a wilms &apos; tumor ,
um , oh , there &apos;s a 10 year old that needs a kidney transplant .
uh , you know , he &apos;s a really cool kid . you &apos;re gonna like him .
well , call them back and get the deposit back then .
well , i &apos;m glad your sister likes the view ,
but i &apos;m the one who has to put on the poufy dress .
you know what ? this conversation is over .
well , i love you , too .
red panties and a lace bra .
he wants to have a christmas wedding ...
in a @-@ a rustic mountain lodge
with red ribbons and mistletoe and a tree
with ornaments made of our photos .
aw . that sounds beautiful .
no , it &apos;s stupid .
what kind of self @-@ respecting man
cares this much about a wedding ?
i did .
yeah , but i did the wedding thing before .
i &apos;m gonna make all those people who showed up the first time
sit through another ceremony because ,
uh , maybe i &apos;ll mean it this time ?
you were there with adele .
you got me a set of ramekins .
and i &apos;d be happy to get you another set .
i want to get married in a field with wildflowers everywhere
and butterflies that are released when i say &quot; i do . &quot;
oh , and i want to have these little mints that say &quot; mint to be . &quot;
you get it ? &apos; cause they &apos;re mints--
there will be no mints . we &apos;re going to the courthouse ,
have a little cocktail party after .
yeah , we &apos;ll see about that .
a man who puts down a deposit
is a man who means business .
well , he has the 12th to get his money back .
that &apos;s two days .
he &apos;d need two years to get me to agree to a wedding
with santa claus running around .
wait . um , today &apos;s the 10th ?
yep .
it was good that owen said that about the lawsuit .
what , his &quot; one big , happy family &quot; crap ?
it &apos;s very sweet unless you &apos;re me .
it needed to be said .
yeah , unless you &apos;re the deformed wife
chained in the attic .
well , what do you want to be to him ?
you left him . do you want to be something else ?
well , i don &apos;t want to be chained in the attic .
hey , guys , have you seen jackson ?
he &apos;s not answering my texts .
why , you looking for some jackson action ?
oh , my god . what did i tell you ?
30 years as a nun , she cannot get enough .
um , so you haven &apos;t seen him ?
no , but we will tell him
that you really , really , really need to see him if--
bye , april .
okay , so if we go to the axilla ...
and then down the forearm to grab the m.a.b.c. ,
there are two branches .
okay , now this is the really cool part , okay ?
it &apos;s so freakin &apos; state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art ,
i can &apos;t even believe it exists .
that &apos;s a lot of build @-@ up . better be good .
we take just the anterior branch
and we use that part for the cable graft .
what else you got ?
did you hear what i just said ?
yeah . what else you got ?
okay . yeah .
we could , um ...
do an end @-@ to @-@ side transfer .
the , um , statistics are really , really good .
what else ?
derek , i went to the trouble of making a slide .
could you please look at it ?
you know as well as i do
that those stats come from studies on rats .
and as far as the end @-@ to @-@ side transfer ,
yeah , it &apos;s state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art ,
but once you take away my good nerve ,
i will have less function than i did before .
you don &apos;t have it . keep trying .
i practiced with arizona last night .
she made a much more enthusiastic derek .
what &apos;s wrong ?
dr. bailey ,
did you know the ten coldest counties in the country
are all located in minnesota ?
um , you &apos;re glad to be back . i &apos;m glad you &apos;re glad .
now did you double @-@ check
the history of the heart valve like i asked ?
grumpy .
yes , and based on the history ,
we &apos;ve chosen a pericardial bioprosthesis .
i made sure the o.r. has it ready .
okay , and , dr. ross ,
you took care of our room situation ?
east @-@ facing window like he likes .
it &apos;s also private .
good . okay .
hey .
we &apos;ve arrived !
hi . dr. bailey !
how does the liver look ? is it a good one ?
the best .
dr. ross spent the last 24 hours on the phone with u.n.o.s.
to make sure it didn &apos;t go anywhere else .
they were threatening to send it to portland ,
but i went all &quot; dr. bailey &quot; on &apos; em .
that &apos;s my man .
a little thank @-@ you for all your hard work .
thank you . oh .
for you . white birch rosemary .
and ... look at you .
what &apos;s new on the wedding front ?
have you gotten a wedding dress ?
you know it &apos;s all about the dress .
he got knocked down by some woman at the mall
and fell pretty hard into a perfume stand .
he &apos;s got some abdominal pain and a deep lac on his hand .
all right . why aren &apos;t you suturing him ?
i paged plastics .
the patient &apos;s a little difficult .
okay , well , you &apos;re a doctor .
it &apos;s your job to deal with difficult .
i know , but ...
mr. freeman , i &apos;m dr. grey .
do you mind if i examine you ?
all yours .
great . okay .
please let me know if you feel any pain--
i &apos;m sorry .
dad ! i am so sorry .
ignore him .
dad , i swear to god .
this is why danny and tim don &apos;t talk to you anymore .
i never grabbed tim &apos;s ass .
no , you grabbed tim &apos;s wife &apos;s ass ,
and danny &apos;s wife .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
okay . i need you to lean forward for me .
and take a deep breath for me , please .
another one .
oh . and we &apos;re done here .
what is wrong with you ?
it &apos;s a compliment .
it &apos;s horrifying .
i tried to warn you .
you did a lousy job .
there &apos;s some abdominal tenderness ,
so let &apos;s get a c.t. ,
and get me the results right away .
grey , i just got out of surgery .
you got a patient with a hand lac ?
yeah , he &apos;s over there . and watch your ass .
what do ...
jackson , we need to talk .
i ...
right now .
all right .
what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m late .
for what ?
four days . i have never been four days late in my life .
four days late for ... oh .
of course .
just when i start thinking that maybe this could work ...
something that feels so good can &apos;t be bad , right ?
i ... i don &apos;t know . maybe jesus is okay with premarital sex .
he made that rule when people got married at 16 .
he never expected people to wait till they were 30 .
but now i have a baby in my uterus ,
and it is clear that he is not okay with it .
okay , jesus . i get it .
relax , okay ? you &apos;re not pregnant .
i am a clock . i am never late .
we use condoms .
condoms break .
they don &apos;t break .
wh ...
sometimes they break . just ...
w ... we &apos;re gonna have you pee on a stick ,
and we &apos;ll know in five minutes .
no . no . those things can give off false positives .
it ... it has to be a blood test .
fine . you &apos;re right .
we &apos;ll go draw your blood right now . okay ?
jackson ...
hey , we are not gonna worry
until we know for sure .
okay ?
okay .
dr. kepner , we need you .
14 year old in a horseback riding accident .
hypotensive and bleeding through his bandages .
i &apos;m around all day ,
so just ... just text me later .
wexler , lewis , trauma one now .
hey , avery , you &apos;re helping me research a plan
for shepherd &apos;s hand today .
uh , can it wait ?
i &apos;m a little busy .
oh , well , every second ,
the nerve is dying a little bit more .
as we stand here and argue , his nerve is dying .
yes , but ...
oh , his nerve died just a little bit more .
let &apos;s go . snap , snap .
hunt . nice speech this morning .
very , &quot; once more unto the breach , dear friends . &quot;
shakespeare . you know , &quot; henry v. &quot;
i mean , the point is that you ...
you &apos;re handling all this well .
thanks . you ... need something ?
uh , just checking in .
you ... you all right with this , meeting ?
yeah , i &apos;m just telling them what happened . why ?
oh , no reason .
it &apos;s just , you know , a lawsuit like this ,
reminds a hospital that it &apos;s a business .
the angles change pretty quickly .
so don &apos;t let them back you in a corner .
i should be fine .
of course . of course . look , you know what you &apos;re doing .
just ignore me .
dr. hunt ,
as i &apos;m sure you &apos;re aware , members of your staff
have now lodged an official complaint
with intent to sue seattle grace mercy west hospital . i am .
so today is just a preliminary interview
to prepare the hospital &apos;s case .
this is a confidentiality agreement .
you can look it over . it just says that ...
you should make note that it specifically mentions
your wife @-@ dr. cristina yang
as one of the plaintiffs in the case .
yeah , i saw that .
so we understand , this is an unusual situation for you
and a clear conflict of interest for the hospital .
don &apos;t worry . whatever we say here will stay here .
great . no awkward conversations around the dinner table .
okay , so let &apos;s start
with why your team flew to boise memorial on that day .
boise asked us to help with a conjoined twin separation .
we &apos;d had success with a very complicated procedure months earlier .
graham cunningham , 65,
presented with cirrhosis approximately seven years ago .
he &apos;s now in end @-@ stage liver disease
and has subsequently also developed valvular heart disease .
well done , dr. ross .
i &apos;ve been practicing .
why didn &apos;t we treat this valve disease ear ...
right away ? because the valve replacement surgery
would &apos;ve caused his liver to fail .
but the liver transplant would &apos;ve caused his heart to fail .
that &apos;s why we &apos;ll do both surgeries today .
first the valve replacement , then the liver transplant .
good .
you almost make me want to learn your name .
dr. b. , you &apos;re confident this liver &apos;s the one ?
we &apos;re not gonna get halfway to the o.r.
and have to turn around like last time ?
all signs point to this being the one .
we just had to date a bunch of others to find it .
kind of like you ,
kissing all those frogs before you met me .
a dirty old man touched my butt today , twice .
really ?
how was your day ? how was callie ?
well , she didn &apos;t touch my butt .
derek .
what ?
i &apos;m all for burying things with sex ,
but this is your career .
you want to talk about it ?
yes .
why do the surgery at all ?
i &apos;ve always wanted to spend more time fishing .
i just got zola her first fishing pole . it &apos;s pink .
derek .
there is no good solution .
there &apos;s half fixes .
maybe there &apos;s more function . maybe there &apos;s not .
and if they can &apos;t fix it , then that &apos;s it .
it &apos;s done . it &apos;s over .
it &apos;s not over . you find a fix .
you used to be so dark and twisty .
now you &apos;re optimistic .
we &apos;re not talking about me .
let &apos;s just not talk at all .
that &apos;s it . good .
avoid twisting the cables too tightly
or they &apos;ll cut through the sternum .
what is this i hear about you letting your intern
do a procedure on my patient ?
you tattled on me ?
i didn &apos;t spend the last three months on liver watch
so you could kill this guy .
hey , no one &apos;s killing anyone .
she &apos;s good . better than you .
no gloating .
yang .
do you know how long this man &apos;s waited for a liver ?
so long he was married to a woman
the first time he came in here .
now he &apos;s come out .
he &apos;s met the man he &apos;s meant to spend the rest of his life with .
this is not the man we let an intern practice on .
okay , relax . she won &apos;t do it .
since when did you become such a romantic ?
you &apos;re lucky you even get to work with me .
does that hurt at all , sean ?
good . good .
all right . you having any fun here ?
i heard there was a pro basketball player
aaking his way around the halls here .
did you get to meet him ? tall guy .
he probably hit his head on the door on the way in .
all right . well , we will , um , check back with you later .
bye .
good job .
you said $ 20 if i didn &apos;t ask about the fake leg .
i only got $ 10 on me .
then next time she comes in ,
i &apos;m gonna tell her how you told me
that i couldn &apos;t say anything .
keep your trap shut .
hey , is he alway that quiet ?
oh , yeah . strange kid .
dr. robbins , dr. kepner needs some extra hands
on a horse trampling-- 14 year old .
all right . tell &apos; em we &apos;re on our way .
yeah . um , i &apos;ll catch up with you .
no , i can wait .
no , a kid got trampled by a horse , alex . go .
can i help you ?
no . um ...
i just got lost
on my way to ...
radiology .
can you take over the ultrasound ?
he &apos;s got abdominal tenderness ,
and i need to get control of this bleeding .
i think he may have lacerated his femoral vein .
my sneakers .
what &apos;s that ?
don &apos;t lose my sneakers .
they &apos;re 200 bucks .
that &apos;s why his leg slipped through the stirrup .
you have to wear a shoe with a heel when you ride a horse .
kid spends 200 bucks on sneakers ,
he &apos;s obviously not the king of awesome choices .
all right , there &apos;s possible blood on the upper left quadrant .
great . let &apos;s get him up to c.t.
hold on . wait for robbins .
uh , are you kidding me ?
she &apos;s on her way .
he just got dragged 20 yards by a horse .
he &apos;s totally stable . look , it &apos;s her first day back .
he did a stupid thing .
i &apos;m not gonna let it ruin his life .
let &apos;s move this gurney right now .
right away , doctor .
okay , somebody step out and call .
let &apos;s go .
it looks like ...
there &apos;s some calcification of the aortic annulus here ?
is that a statement or a question ?
i ...
will check again .
oh , no .
look at that . he comes bearing bad news .
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
the plane taking the transplant team got delayed by rain .
we &apos;ll know more in an hour .
we &apos;ve heard that before .
you don &apos;t know . maybe this is a good thing .
like maybe the plane has to be late
so the transport ambulance doesn &apos;t crash into a 18 @-@ wheeler .
things happen for a reason .
here we go .
well , they do .
i always say ,
i would never have met hank if my ex--carol--
hadn &apos;t forced us to move to seattle
to be closer to her family .
you wasted 30 years in that marriage .
no , it wasn &apos;t a waste . it got me here . i met you .
30 years too late .
better late than never .
things don &apos;t always happen for a reason , graham .
i was alone all that time , and you were scared .
and i don &apos;t believe that that &apos;s the way
things were supposed to be .
we were supposed to be together ,
have our entire lives together .
so i can &apos;t just sit back and be okay with you losing
the one thing that can get me my 30 years with you .
i &apos;m sorry .
he &apos;s just a little scared .
you &apos;re damn right i am .
you don &apos;t screw this up .
we won &apos;t .
dr. ross , you &apos;ll make sure that the liver gets here ?
if i have to drive to oregon and pick it up myself .
see ? maybe that &apos;s why i had to say things happen for a reason ,
so you &apos;d yell at them .
good news . your scans came back clean .
so you &apos;re free to go home .
oh , thank god . you got lucky this time .
the next lady in the mall might have a gun .
and so dr. wilson can assist you
with any other questions that you may have ,
and i will write you the prescription
for the painkillers
nice .
that &apos;s enough !
i am all you &apos;ve got left , dad . and i &apos;m done .
you sit around and mope about how mom left you ,
but of course she did .
you &apos;d be crazy to stay married to you .
how long has this been going on , the touching ?
i don &apos;t know .
my mom left him , like , two years ago ,
but it was at least a year before that .
and before that ?
he was ... normal .
he was my dad .
dr. grey , what &apos;s going on ?
excuse me for a second .
did you see the way he was grabbing my pen ?
mm @-@ hmm . that &apos;s a grasping reflex .
it &apos;s a frontal release sign .
i thought that went away after infancy .
well , it does unless you have a tumor in your frontal lobe ,
in which case , primitive reflexes come back
along with disinhibition .
patients start becoming impulsive ,
saying things they shouldn &apos;t .
grabbing ass . you &apos;re so smart .
stop sucking up .
go get a c.t. and page neuro .
oh , i &apos;m about to head back into my meeting .
um , bailey and i are doing the heart @-@ liver surgery today .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m lead cardio on it ,
and russell wanted you to sign off on it .
okay . that all ?
no . why am i here ?
what ?
you pushed to have me back .
i am curious why , because you don &apos;t seem to want me here .
oh , you &apos;re gonna do great things , cristina ,
and i &apos;m running a hospital .
i &apos;d ther have you do that under our banner .
you &apos;re good business .
that &apos;s the only reason ?
you moved away .
you asked me to stop calling you .
now you &apos;re back . what--what do you want ?
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t know . that &apos;s--
well , let me tell you what we do know .
we want different things .
every time we try to ignore that ,
we end up hurting each other .
we don &apos;t work .
that &apos;s what we know .
and that hasn &apos;t changed .
nothing &apos;s changed at all . i have to go back to my meeting .
the brochure has a picture of the place
decorated with icicle lights
and those reindeer made out of twigs .
that &apos;s gross .
ooh , what about a cupcake tower
instead of a cake ?
you could do red and green frosting .
oh , come on .
you guys are in love . why not celebrate that ?
&apos;cause sometimes love makes you do stupid things .
suddenly you &apos;re screwed the rest of your life .
what he said .
why are you even talking ?
i need that answer about the radial nerve transfer .
yeah . slow reader here .
hey .
hey . oh , arizona .
hey , dr. robbins . uh , you &apos;re working with horse kid , right ?
uh , yeah , i am . karev &apos;s got him in pre @-@ op .
and dr. kepner , was she also in pre @-@ op or is she probably--
excuse me . why would she know where your girlfriend is ?
read the article .
hey , um , i &apos;m gonna do an exploratory lap
on this kid tonight , so i might be home a little late .
you &apos;re doing exploratory surgery your first day back ?
that &apos;s a lot of standing . you think that ...
you might get bored ?
&apos;cause i get bored just standing .
and sitting--i also get bored sitting .
hey . uh , bailey and ben are having a christmas wedding .
they &apos;re gonna have carolers .
oh , i love christmas carolers .
there will no carolers .
来3125房间见我
torres , i &apos;m gonna be right back .
no , no , no . i need you here .
jackson .
sorry . i thought you were ...
you two having a sex date ?
we are not having a sex date .
not everything is about sex .
you okay ?
yes .
no .
oh , god .
april ?
i had plan .
i was gonna be married and have a husband .
our wedding would have the--the mints .
we &apos;d be ...
&quot; mint to be , &quot; committed .
i was gonna tell my husband that i was pregnant
by giving him a t @-@ shirt that said &quot; world &apos;s greatest dad . &quot;
now look at me .
you &apos;re pregnant ?
i think so .
well , i don &apos;t know .
plans never work out the way you think they &apos;re going to ,
especially with babies .
you try and try to get pregnant , and you can &apos;t .
and then a baby comes when you least expect it ,
probably because you didn &apos;t plan it .
plans don &apos;t mean anything .
i was just leaving .
tell us about your decision
in using skytrip express as the charter company .
it wasn &apos;t my decision .
the hospital has a deal with that company .
has the hospital always used that company ?
i have no idea .
were you aware that skytrip had a history of mechanical issues ?
what ?
f.a.a. reports 4 incidents since july 2010 .
no , i didn &apos;t . of course i didn &apos;t .
you don &apos;t remember switching to skytrip
from another charter company last december ?
i &apos;m not ...
i &apos;m--i wasn &apos;t aware of that .
i @-@ i run a surgical staff . i &apos;m not a--
in a round of budget cuts heading into fiscal 2012,
transportation policy shifted
from your previous company to skytrip ,
who it appears subcontracts to several smaller companies--
who had mechanical issues .
that &apos;s right .
this is how we save money ,
by jeopardizing our people &apos;s lives ?
who are vetting these guys ?
who approved switching to a company
without checking their damn safety records ?
is this your signature , dr. hunt ?
i don &apos;t remember this specifically , but ...
yes .
yes , i approved this . i ...
i did it .
so what happens now , i resign ?
this interview is just to ascertain--
that is the last thing that we want .
i &apos;m sorry . can i interject something here , off the record ?
dr. hunt , i am roberta thompson .
i am new to the board .
yeah , we &apos;ve met .
right .
um , i just want to be clear here .
you said it yourself .
you run a surgical staff ,
and you do a hell of a job at it .
you wouldn &apos;t do it so well if we expected you
to chase down every zero on a budget report .
owen ... a mistake was made ...
an oversight ,
and it cost us , all of us .
god knows it cost our doctors .
and you , your own wife has paid a terrible price for this ,
but the board wants you to know
that you have our full support in this .
you okay ?
yeah .
you ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t know .
i know .
i guess i should &apos;ve been on the pill .
yeah , i guess we were both pretty stupid .
jackson , i can do this myself , you know ?
what ?
just , if this isn &apos;t what you want ... why--
what the hell , kepner ? our surgery &apos;s about to start .
i &apos;m anemic .
s.t.d. screen .
great timing , though , &apos; cause i just finished .
and can you get that ?
perf--thank you .
yeah .
all righty . and see ya .
dr. bailey .
hey . we &apos;re almost ready for you .
after this bile duct , we &apos;ll be just about done .
dr. bailey , dr. warren &apos;s calling the front desk .
he was wondering what time your surgery would be done .
yeah , i bet he is .
he probably found another inspiration picture
in a bride magazine he wants to discuss .
do we do silver bells or snowflakes
on our invitation ?
garland or poinsettias on the centerpiece ?
psh . uh , suction .
it &apos;s just a wedding .
oh , come on .
out of all people , i thought
i could count on you to have my back .
do you think i wanted that wedding at meredith &apos;s house ?
that was for owen .
put on the dress . there are bigger battles .
right , &apos; cause that philosophy
worked out so well for you and owen . t @-@ tube .
here you go .
dr. kepner ?
sorry , this p.d.s. suture isn &apos;t holding ,
and i can &apos;t get hemostasis .
horseback riding is supposed to be fun ,
but even if you wear the right shoes ,
and a helmet and everything , protection doesn &apos;t always work .
so you know what ? what &apos;s the point ?
you might as well just ride bareback .
karev , can you take this over for a second ?
yeah , sure .
you , whatever your name is ,
can you stop stalking me with chairs ?
i @-@ i &apos;m stretching , which is normal .
w @-@ we all need to stretch sometimes .
so can you just get that thing away from me ?
pickups .
here you go .
you were right . it &apos;s a tumor .
move .
but this neuro guy says it &apos;s too far along to operate ,
so they &apos;re just gonna send him home .
she spent all these years
thinking he was just a dirty old man ,
and now she knows it &apos;s a tumor
and that &apos;s not who he is , it &apos;s too late , and ...
i &apos;m talking to myself .
dr. yang , i &apos;m almost finished here .
you can get ready to close the sternum .
boki , i think dr. yang prefers sternal cables ,
not monofilament wire .
dr. edwards , how would you like the honor
of closing for me today ?
uh , no . you heard me .
no interns closing up this patient .
dr. bailey , i might not give the best wedding advice ,
but this is my intern under my service ,
and she &apos;s been practicing this procedure for days .
i am more than confident she &apos;s prepared .
fine . let her close .
prepare the sternal cable , please , boki .
dr. bailey , should there be this much bleeding ?
oh , he &apos;s not clotting .
uh , let &apos;s get some f.f.p. and factor vii up here .
get in there with some lap pads .
we need to apply pressure quick .
all right , guys . okay , let &apos;s make sure
that we check pulses every two hours .
i &apos;m gonna go talk to the parents .
everybody out .
i said get out .
you okay ?
robbins , are you hurt ? did you hit your head ?
i was--i was so proud of myself ...
for getting through today
and the surgery ,
like nothing was different ,
and i &apos;m such a big shot
that i went and put all my weight on my left foot ,
except ...
i don &apos;t have a left foot .
and now i &apos;m on my ass .
and you should--you should see the look on your face .
oh , are you gonna-- are you gonna help me up ?
yeah . come on .
come on .
how &apos;s the bleeding ?
still won &apos;t stop .
can we try more r.b.c.s ?
that &apos;ll just overload him . what &apos;s his lactate level ?
it &apos;s gone from 9 to 17 in the last 30 minutes .
no .
oh , come on . no . no .
oh , damn it .
what is it ? why &apos;d you stop ?
see how the liver &apos;s patchy ?
he &apos;s rejecting it ?
does this mean i don &apos;t get to close ?
okay , so if we did a pedicle flap ...
we could do a tendon transfer to get back motor function .
where are you ?
what ?
you &apos;ve been staring at your phone all day ,
like some 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl
waiting for a creepy college guy to text her back .
i need you to focus .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
but we both know shepherd
is just gonna shoot this thing down .
he doesn &apos;t want to do the surgery .
oh , he doesn &apos;t know what he wants . he &apos;s just scared .
he wishes this never happened , but it happened ,
and now it &apos;s up to us to come up with a plan .
that makes him feel just a little less scared ,
makes him believe it &apos;ll all be okay .
and we can do that . so come on .
are you with me here ?
i gotta go do something .
what ?
hey . what &apos;s up ?
look at this .
a mesio @-@ orbital frontal lobe tumor .
he &apos;s the grabby guy .
he &apos;s a father .
his whole family &apos;s horrified to be around him .
i thought we could help him ,
but clemens says it &apos;s inoperable .
no , it &apos;s not .
i thought so .
all right , i &apos;ll page clemens ,
let him know that he &apos;s an idiot ,
and walk him through how to do it .
derek .
yeah .
he &apos;s not gonna do as good a job as you .
no , he &apos;s not .
which is why you have to get your hand fixed .
i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t have the results yet .
i told you i would text you .
i &apos;m in . all the way .
what ?
come on .
i know it might not be what you planned
or how you planned it ,
but we can do this .
we &apos;ll get married , have an awesome kid ,
be amazing parents .
i &apos;m in .
don &apos;t say that if you don &apos;t mean it .
i mean it . we can do this .
you really think that--
you said it yourself .
something that feels this good cannot be bad .
so you-- you really want this ?
i want this .
we get married .
we have a house . we get a big yard .
and we have a wedding ?
we have a huge freaking wedding .
in a--in a field with butterflies .
i don &apos;t know . butterflies , a field-- whatever you want .
okay ? your family &apos;s gonna be there .
my family--i mean , my crazy mom &apos;s gonna be there .
she &apos;ll probably bring webber .
whatever . that &apos;s fine .
oh , my gosh .
are we really ...
you sure ?
we can do this ?
we can do this .
how did you know ?
11 years in your job .
mm . you want it back ?
no .
you know , they &apos;re usually looking for a scapegoat ,
someone they can lay all the blame on
and then set &apos; em adrift .
that &apos;s what happened ?
no , the board , they have my back ...
completely .
well , that &apos;s great .
yeah .
why wouldn &apos;t the just ... fire me ?
i don &apos;t know .
what ?
you &apos;re married to someone on the other side .
they seem unhappy about that ?
richard , thanks .
you said it was a perfect match .
it was .
just ... sometimes for reasons we don &apos;t always understand ,
the body doesn &apos;t want to accept the new organ .
so what now ? you--you ...
you put him back on the transplant list ?
yeah . we made calls .
but given graham &apos;s condition ...
he needs this .
look at him .
you can &apos;t tell me there are sicker people out there .
that &apos;s the point , bug . i &apos;m sick .
better they give it to someone who could make it last .
how long do i have ?
mm . a week , maybe .
that &apos;s good .
it &apos;s not 30 years .
but it &apos;s better than nothing .
i &apos;m sorry .
hey , you don &apos;t get to leave .
come back here .
i &apos;m old .
and i &apos;ve had a good life .
i found people to love who loved me back .
you save your tears for someone who needs them .
i mean it . you did good .
we &apos;ve got this week ...
and we &apos;re gonna make it count .
here we go .
&quot; not pregnant . &quot;
oh , god .
thank you , jesus .
now we don &apos;t have to get married .
we &apos;re free .
we just--we just dodged a bullet .
like , the biggest bullet ever .
thank you . thank you , god . thank you . thank you .
thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you .
no .
no , j @-@ jackson , no , i didn &apos;t mean ...
just , you know , now things don &apos;t have to change .
we could stay dating ,
just not while also raising a child .
everything can stay the same .
you know , i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll just go on the pill
so i don &apos;t have to freak out every time that i ... am late .
it &apos;s cool .
seriously , don &apos;t bother .
what ? jack--jackson--
maybe this was a sign , you know ?
that we needed to stop .
honestly , i think it &apos;s for the best .
okay . i @-@ i mean , if that &apos;s what--
it is .
i gotta go , uh , check in on torres .
i will see you later .
okay .
hey , weepy .
no big deal , but don &apos;t do that again .
it &apos;s gross .
uh , sorry .
what ?
you cared about him .
no , i didn &apos;t .
oh , you did , just like you cared about that other intern ,
so much you fought me to teach her .
just like you cared about my wedding
enough to give me personal advice--
good advice--
that i &apos;m actually planning to take .
so i don &apos;t know what happened to you
in that frozen hell of a tundra ,
but you &apos;ve changed .
i did not .
no . no , no , no , no . no . you &apos;re supposed to--
you &apos;re supposed to wait .
i &apos;m coming up with a @-@ a @-@ another plan .
it &apos;s not like the others .
oh , okay , great . well , let &apos;s hear it .
no .
no , you &apos;re just--
you &apos;re gonna crap all over it .
i &apos;ve been busting my ass for you on this
and making powerpoints and--and--and losing sleep ,
to talk to surgeons in switzerland
when i should be talking to you .
you want to fix your hand ? then help me , damn it .
that came out a little stronger than i intended .
you &apos;re right . okay ? so here &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do--
we &apos;re gonna throw out everything we have .
we &apos;re gonna get new studies .
we &apos;re gonna come at it from a different angle .
we &apos;re gonna clear our heads ,
and then we are gonna figure it out .
so do we start right now ?
tomorrow .
you need to take the night off .
thank you .
oh , thank god .
have i changed ?
how ?
how would he know that ?
who ?
he says nothing has changed ,
but what if i &apos;m the thing that &apos;s changed ,
but he won &apos;t friggin &apos; talk to me ?
oh . i &apos;m all caught up now .
do you think i &apos;ve changed ?
well , you want owen back .
i don &apos;t .
yeah , i want owen back .
we &apos;ve changed .
it &apos;s good .
oh , dr. hunt . is there something else ?
yeah , a question .
my conflict of interest here
doesn &apos;t seem to concern you too much .
well , like we said , it &apos;s unusual for--
what about my wife &apos;s conflict of interest ?
she &apos;s married to me , too .
well , that--that &apos;s--
i booked the plane ,
and my wife could benefit financially from my negligence .
you &apos;re hoping that because i &apos;m married to cristina ,
the judge will throw this whole case out .
whoa , dr. hunt .
let &apos;s not overthink this .
the board supports you 100 ...
let me just remind you that
the confidentiality agreement that you signed
is punishable by termination and financial penalties .
i understand .
have a good night .
you ... will be getting an invitation in the mail soon ,
there will probably be elves on it .
you , however , will not be getting me a gift .
are you telling me that if i get you a waffle maker ,
you &apos;ll send it back ?
i do like a waffle .
well , it &apos;s gonna be fine .
you promise ?
no . but i &apos;ll have your back either way .
i wouldn &apos;t be able to show up to work again .
it wasn &apos;t that bad .
it sounds pretty bad .
i cry during sex sometimes . it &apos;s not that bad .
you look like crap .
yeah . that &apos;s about right .
beer .
sure .
so , uh ... kepner &apos;s knocked up ?
i mean , she was acting a little weirder than usual ,
you were taking her blood .
here you go .
well , not that it &apos;s any of your business ,
but ... no , she is not knocked up .
that sounds like something to drink to .
can we get another round ?
coming up .
no more calling her weird .
she is .
yeah , i know . just ...
you &apos;re not allowed to say it .
can you dance ? can you show me your moves ?
hello .
can you dance with me ?
wow . what &apos;s going on here ?
oh , we &apos;re having a little dance party .
so ... i guess you had a good day ?
yeah , yeah . i fell down .
what ? what happened ?
i got back up .
hey , um , i started dinner ,
but then little miss wanted my attention ,
so do you mind finishing the salad ?
sure . hi , baby .
hi , mama . hi , mama .
do you want to dance ?
you see my necklace ?
maybe i do believe it ...
all this &quot; meant to be &quot; stuff .
so ... i talked to clemens .
he referred the tumor patient
to somebody over at seattle pres .
great . uh , take a look at the shirt that i bought zola .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s--it &apos;s in the bag on the counter .
oh , meredith , guys don &apos;t get all goo @-@ goo over baby clothes .
just look .
what is this ?
why not believe it , really ?
who doesn &apos;t want more romance in their life ?
it &apos;s only three weeks
so i shouldn &apos;t even be telling you .
i mean , i still have a hostile uterus ,
and terrible things are constantly happening to us ,
which is why i haven &apos;t told anyone .
i haven &apos;t even told cristina .
so ... if you tell anyone , i @-@ i swear ,
i will kick you out of this house that you built .
don &apos;t worry .
and good things happen to us .
we &apos;re gonna have another baby .
we are gonna have another baby .
maybe it &apos;s just up to us to make it happen ...
to show up and be meant for each other .
thank you for coming .
we should talk .
we should .
at least that way , you &apos;ll find out for sure ...
i think--
we should get a divorce .
that &apos;s what you want ?
if you &apos;re meant to be ...
yeah .
or not .
