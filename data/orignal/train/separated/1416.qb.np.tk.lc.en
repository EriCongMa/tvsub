they are deceptively hard- a curious mix of dance and strength .
you &apos;re making it lame again .
sorry .
ay , dios mio , that coach .
oh , i hate that guy .
he seems to have the kids motivated .
oh , dad , you haven &apos;t seen him .
he taunts the kids . he &apos;s abusive .
listen , if this was a colombian soccer league , long time ago ,
one of the kids would have taken that guy out and-
a coach is supposed to ride the kids hard .
phil , help me out here .
he &apos;s a mean man .
oh , you &apos;re such a woman .
come to the game . you &apos;ll see .
this guy &apos;s a real motherscratcher .
pardon the language , gloria .
&quot; gloria &quot; ?
he better cool it ,
or i &apos;m gonna introduce him to the captain and tennille .
sorry we &apos;re late . i was at work .
oh , he loves to say that .
and happy barbecue .
oh . since mitchell is between jobs ,
i &apos;ve taken a part @-@ time job at a greeting card store ,
which i love .
plus , with my discount ,
we &apos;re saving a fortune .
how is spending a ton of money on greeting cards saving us a fortune ?
it &apos;s math .

2.95 . 2.95 . 4.95 .
forty percent off .
2.95 .
3.95 .
forty percent off . forty percent off .
mitchell , i got this golf buddy of mine .
great guy . super successful . you two should talk .
it could mean a job for you .
oh , thanks , dad , but i &apos;m-
i &apos;m not really looking for anything right now .
but-
yeah , that &apos;s right .
with me bringing home the bacon ,
mitchell doesn &apos;t have to rush into anything .
yeah , i know you have all that greeting card &quot; screw you &quot; money ,
but , uh , talk to the guy ?
he &apos;s expecting your call in the morning .
dad , i appreciate it , but in the future- i can &apos;t stand this .
i am sorry , but i-
no . those steaks have been done for five minutes .
i &apos;m taking &apos; em off the grill .
i &apos;m sorry . i know how it feels
to have him stick his nose where it doesn &apos;t belong .
no biggie . it &apos;s just jay being jay .
but one day i &apos;m gonna be a grandfather ,
and then everybody better hide their meat .

i am losing my mind .
as much as i love lily-
which is , you know , more than life itself-
i am- whoo- not cut out to be a stay @-@ at @-@ home dad .
no , but it &apos;s cameron &apos;s turn .
it &apos;s cameron &apos;s turn to be out in the world ...
interacting with other grown @-@ ups while i get to stay at home ...
and @-@ and plot the death of dora the explorer .
like to fill her backpack with bricks
and throw her into candy cane river .
so , i don &apos;t know . should i- should i call him ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe just to get your dad off your back .
yeah . yeah .
i mean ,
because the last thing i want for you is to take a job right now .
i am loving our life .
i am in a really dark space .
being away from my lily is literally torture .
and i can &apos;t pressure mitchell ,
but i really , really , really just want him to get a job ...

if your goal is to suck !
phil , you-
i &apos;m on it .

uh , look . we appreciate your passion ,
but some of us are worried that
the yelling is getting counterproductive .
i got this . come on , stupid !
no , you don &apos;t &quot; got this . &quot; what you got is a bad attitude .
who are you ?
i happen to be the stepfather of-
doesn &apos;t matter who . what you need to start doing ...
is a little more coaching and a little less yelling .
&apos;cause if i hear you call one of these kids stupid again ,
i swear to god , i &apos;ll throw a shoe at your head .
screw it . i don &apos;t need this .
you think you can do a better job ?
you coach .
jay , you know , i was handling it .
yeah , i saw how you broke out peaches and herb .
it &apos;s the captain and-
okay . so , your old coach had to leave for a little while .
why ? is he sick ?
yes . he &apos;s very , very sick .
is he going to die ?
everybody dies , boys . let &apos;s focus on what &apos;s important .
our next game is in one hour .
we are going to go from being five fingers to being a fist .

that &apos;s what i &apos;m talkin &apos; &apos; bout !
all right , gentlemen . i talked to the referee . i &apos;m coaching .
oh , really ? &apos; cause i-
phil , i coached football .
jay , i actually coached basketball .
i think i can get these guys-

now you think you can round us up some waters ?
yeah .
go ahead .
gentlemen , this is what i need .
i want you to hit &apos; em , and i want you to hit &apos; em hard .
father @-@ in @-@ laws are tough ,
because you can &apos;t let &apos; em push you around ...
and you also have to show them respect .
it &apos;s like walking a tightrope .
which , by the way , i can do , because i went to trapeze school .
did jay ? i doubt it .
all right , when you back into-
honey , i &apos;m gonna take off .
i &apos;m gonna buy alex some clothes .
okeydoke .

ah . a fellow victim .
thank you again for taking care of lily . i know it &apos;s last @-@ minute .
ay . don &apos;t be silly .
we &apos;ll probably just stick around for a few minutes .
you know how fussy she gets when we pass her off , so-
oh . she seems fine .
yeah .
ay . i think she &apos;s getting used to
being away from you now that you have the new job .
mwah ! so proud of you .
we need to talk .
okay . what happened ?
mom , i love you ,
but your words of encouragement
encourage the other kids to make fun of me .
ay . okay .
i won &apos;t say anything else on the next game . promise .
we both know that your latin blood makes that impossible .
i think it would be better if you didn &apos;t come to the next game .
i know .
i hate our house .
i know .
what &apos;s- what &apos;s this thing ?
i don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s fancy .

everybody , mitchell pritchett and his partner , cameron .
business partners . mergers and acquisitions .
i &apos;m kidding . we &apos;re gay .
stop talking .
when things are relaxed , i &apos;m great in social situations .
i would have fit in at the algonquin round table .
but when the stakes are high , i get a little tense .
i &apos;d be the guy that would knock over the round table .
then dorothy parker would make a quip ,
james thurber would laugh ,
and then i would end up leaving , crying .
how long you been on the lam ?
what ?
honey , you are looking around like the feds are after you .
no , i &apos;m not . let &apos;s just get this over with .
oh . all right .

but you said to be aggressive .
yeah !

you gotta coach . i can &apos;t take it .
you talkin &apos; to me ?
yeah , i &apos;m talkin &apos; to you .

i was dealing with the coach . you pushed me aside .
i was dealing with the boys . you pushed me aside .
believe it or not , jay ,
there are some things that i am better at than you are .
bam ! it &apos;s out there .
oh , for god &apos;s sake .
coach !
he &apos;s calling you .
listen . i don &apos;t blame you for being angry . all right ?
i &apos;m used to taking charge . that &apos;s all .
i should have let you coach from the get @-@ go .
and ?
i love you .
no . the barbecue .
oh , for god &apos;s sake .
i &apos;m sure your steaks would have been delicious ... and not chewy .
okay . i &apos;ll do it .

hey , hey . guys . who wants to go out like a champ ?
yeah !

i love it ! okay , jordy , you inbound to luke .
manny , you set a pick on luke &apos;s man
and roll to the bucket .
luke , you know what to do .
no , i don &apos;t .
bounce @-@ pass to manny .
but , dad-
coach , manny hasn &apos;t taken a single shot all season .
then chances are he &apos;ll be open .
okay , guys . let &apos;s bring it out .
hey , hey . bring it in .
let &apos;s show these guys what kind of team they &apos;re about to beat .
huh ? &quot; li &apos;i dribblers &quot; on three .
one , two , three- li &apos;i dribblers !
okay , red ball . side out . here we go .
what &apos;s my coaching philosophy ?
give a kid a bird-
yes !
and he becomes one of those weird dudes
who walks around with a bird on his shoulder .
but give him a pair of wings ,
he can fly .
unless he has absolutely no hand @-@ eye coordination .
okay , i support you .
mom .
that was 20 minutes .
mom , i am so , so sorry .
i know it &apos;s no excuse ,
but i &apos;ve been feeling a lot of pressure at school .
you know , with friends .
and i love you so much ,
and i appreciate everything you do for me .
i &apos;m still your little girl .
oh , honey ! that was so sweet .
can i get $ 20 ? a bunch of us are going to a movie ,
and we &apos;re gonna get something to eat afterwards .
jenna &apos;s brother &apos;s gonna take us home .

you might wanna pick yourself up a training bra .
i know you don &apos;t need one now ,
but your little boobies are gonna come in soon .
mommy loves you , kitten !
mwah ! mwah !
teach her to screw with me .
i set a pick and then rolled towards the basket .
luke passed to me . i shot the ball and almost made it .
i bought lily the cutest little dress today .
and then i stole the ball from the other team ,
did a 360 and almost dunked it .
that &apos;s nice .
ay . i just had the best day today with lily .
that girl &apos;s so sweet .
i have a game next saturday . you could come .
no , it &apos;s okay . i wouldn &apos;t want to embarrass you .
