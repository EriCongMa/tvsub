the bank loan came through .
in a lasagna box ?
this is our lifeline .
and i will pay it all back .
if the bank finds out about your unauthorized loan ,
that &apos;s like a felony , right ?
it &apos;s only a felony if they find out .
you &apos;re not the only one who &apos;s got stuff
they wanna keep from their parents .
you busy next friday ?
jenna , no , wait , don &apos;t hang up . damn it !
you just gotta stop working on these videos . they &apos;re dangerous .
especially since the people that we &apos;re talking about
are in this town watching me .
what are you-- hanna !
you are out of the phone tap business .
ezra , meet me tonight at 8 : 00 .
if you come , it means that there &apos;s still a chance for us .
i hooked up with someone when i was away .
you said it was over , right ?
it looks like he won &apos;t take no for an answer .
training a horse is an art .
you have to work with the animal ,
taking all the fight out if it until it truly is broken .
that &apos;s how you &apos;re gonna feel when i &apos;m through with you .
we &apos;re moving back to rosewood .
&quot; we &quot; ?
me , isabel , kate .
kate &apos;s going to be in rosewood ?
what do you mean , she destroyed the flash drive ?
i kept a copy of the files .
and i &apos;ll keep working on them , too ,
if we keep it a secret from hanna .
check this out .
what is it ?
it &apos;s just an old box .
turn the volume up .
can you make the view full screen ?
maybe make it lighter . the picture seems really dark .
all right , that &apos;s it . i &apos;ve officially stopped taking requests .
can you guys like back up a little bit ?
we &apos;re not even standing that close to you .
really ?
then how do i know you had a cheeseburger for lunch ?
once you &apos;re a member of the club , you &apos;re always a member of the club .
um , haven &apos;t we already seen this before ?
yeah , but look here .
it &apos;s the box jason gave me of ali &apos;s .
i still can &apos;t see what &apos;s inside of it , though .
just give me a second .
it &apos;s hanna .
we may be able to get a clear shot if i--
hanna .
if i play it out frame @-@ by @-@ frame--
uh , i can maybe blow up the image , but then--
guess we know who &apos;s low man on the totem pole .
yeah , i can &apos;t take this anymore .
hey , hanna .
hey , spencer . what are you up to ?
not much .
oh , well , great . do you wanna watch a movie ?
oh , come on , i &apos;ll even watch one
of those artsy foreign ones you like ,
where all they do is stare out windows .
i &apos;m sorry , hanna , i really can &apos;t right now .
i &apos;m just with my family .
emily !
you guys , shut up !
sorry , hanna . i really have to go .
uh , yeah . yeah , sure . i get it .
say hi to your family for me .
you &apos;re kidding me .
i &apos;m sorry , she was--
hey !
ladies .
is that a driver &apos;s license ?
yeah .
is that melissa ?
i don &apos;t know . it could be jenna .
it &apos;s just kinda hard to tell .
hold on .
it &apos;s ali .
but ali already had a fake i.d.
and it definitely wasn &apos;t this one .
why would she need an i.d. that didn &apos;t even look like her ?
god , it &apos;s so weird seeing ali with dark hair .
i can &apos;t even look at that anymore .
sorry , guys , i gotta go . i &apos;m meeting up mia ,
but , see you tomorrow .
bye , em .
bye .
wait , do you have to go , too ?
i was hoping that you could sleep over .
i thought maybe we could both use the company .
i &apos;d like that , but i &apos;ve made plans with holden .
oh . i thought you were only gonna hang out with him
so you could see ezra .
well , i was . but ...
i don &apos;t know , we actually started to become friends .
so have you heard from ezra ?
no , i haven &apos;t .
i just can &apos;t believe that he never showed up
and he never called you .
yeah .
how about you ? have you talked to toby ?
no .
i didn &apos;t see his truck outside .
no , i drove it back over to his parents &apos; house .
i just sat in it for a while and , um ...
and i listened to the radio .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i don &apos;t know how you &apos;re holding it together .
believe me , not as put together as i seem .
okay .
you have to tell me the truth .
i feel like i &apos;m the reason that we &apos;re lying to hanna .
did i push us into doing this ?
no , of course not .
there are just , certain situations that you have to lie to your friends ,
even if you hate doing it .
yeah .
are you okay ?
yeah , i just ...
i don &apos;t know .
you seem kind of distracted .
i am .
look , lying to my parents was one thing ,
but lying to my friends is really hard .
aria , i &apos;m not asking you to lie to your friends .
well , it &apos;s not my friends that i don &apos;t trust .
it &apos;s ... other people .
i &apos;ve been burned before .
i thought you said your mom was warming to the idea of us being a couple .
she &apos;s ... thawing .
and your dad ?
how fast do glaciers melt ?
not very .
that &apos;s why they call it the ice age .
well , you know what that means ?
it just means we have to generate more heat .
so are your friends coming over ?
no . i told you . they &apos;re being annoying .
what does that mean ?
never mind . it &apos;s not a big deal .
okay , can we talk about the elephant in the room ?
kate is not an elephant , she &apos;s a snake ,
and she &apos;s going to my school .
mom , my life is completely ruined .
it &apos;s not ruined , it &apos;s just gonna be an adjustment .
the only thing she &apos;s adjusting are her plans to take me down .
i spoke to your dad and he said he made it clear to kate
that there &apos;ll be serious consequences if--
oh , please , she &apos;s not gonna listen to him .
look , hanna ...
i &apos;m not exactly looking forward
to running into isabel at the super market ,
but if we don &apos;t take the high road ,
we &apos;re gonna be the ones who end up looking like trash .
so just promise me that you will do
everything you can to make kate feel welcome tomorrow .
fine . i promise .
hey , guys .
hi .
how was the movie ?
pretty good.- great .
you know what , you guys ? can you hang tight for just a sec ?
i gotta get some cash out of the atm .
okay .
i am so sorry .
you sure know how to make a guy sweat .
no , i know .
we tried to take this shortcut , and then we ended up--
don &apos;t worry about it . okay , so ... dinner .
you had the pasta with pesto ,
and i had linguini with meat sauce .
okay , great . did we get any sides ?
aria , your dad &apos;s not gonna ask if we ordered sides .
oh , trust me , he will .
my mom &apos;s got him on this low @-@ cholesterol diet ,
and he &apos;s living vicariously through everyone else &apos;s meals .
okay , then ...
uh , garlic bread ?
sure .
with extra butter .
so are we still on for tomorrow ?
yeah , sure .
what ?
i just realized that this
will be the third time we &apos;ve gone out this week .
what are people gonna think ?
let &apos;s keep &apos; em guessing .
so ...
what did you guys have for dinner ?
so what &apos;d you guys do last night ?
oh , we studied for a chem test .
we went to spencer &apos;s for help .
so today is doomsday , huh ?
why ? did you see her ?
han , maybe kate wants to start fresh .
the last time i gave her the benefit of the doubt ,
i ended up blowing chunks on my chunky heels .
oh , my god ! is that her ?
what ?
never mind .
hanna , come on , you need to relax .
i would be if you guys were doing a better job keeping a lookout .
hanna , i never got a good look at kate to begin with .
the only time i &apos;ve ever seen her was across a crowded church .
what is hanging out under your sweater ?
is that a dude &apos;s undershirt ?
maybe .
it &apos;s toby &apos;s .
you guys , do not look at me like
i &apos;m one of those dogs with wheels for legs , okay ?
em , when is your mom coming ?
tomorrow . i &apos;m really excited .
hanna ?
kate .
welcome to rosewood high .
thanks .
hi , i &apos;m kate .
we haven &apos;t officially met yet .
hey , i &apos;m aria .
emily .
spencer .
so , i got my schedule ,
and first period , i have history with mr. barocas .
oh , yeah , mr. barocas . he &apos;s easy .
everybody likes him .
um , i can show you where it is .
i &apos;m actually in that class , too .
yeah , kate , um , have we actually met before ?
you &apos;re right , we have , at the wedding .
it &apos;s nice to have met you all . bye .
thanks for doing this .
i wouldn &apos;t have blamed you
if you decided to make me fend for myself .
yeah , don &apos;t worry about it .
不然我就把你家通心粉盒里的秘密抖给警察
are you okay ?
yeah . oh , yeah , it &apos;s just my mom ,
wondering what time i &apos;ll be home for dinner .
who knows what she needed it for .
she was seeing ian . maybe they used to go out together .
so maybe ali found a loophole , a way to fly under &quot; a &apos;s &quot; radar .
what , by being someone else ?
yeah , the brunette on the i.d.
i was never his number one fan ,
but i can &apos;t even look at him now that he &apos;s with jenna .
he &apos;s been going through girls in this school
like they &apos;re kleenex .
who cares that he &apos;s a player ? he &apos;s &quot; a &apos;s &quot; new eyes .
it &apos;s so frustrating .
he and jenna are always just out of reach .
if we could just get close enough to ...
wait . what if ali wasn &apos;t trying to get away ?
what if she was trying to get closer ?
what do you mean ?
by creating an alter @-@ ego
so she could get close enough to investigate ,
maybe even to expose &quot; a. &quot;
hey .
hey .
where &apos;s the monster ?
who ?
kate .
oh , she &apos;s at orientation ,
and she &apos;s being freakishly nice to me .
so why do you look like that ?
do you think that caleb still has that video file somewhere ?
because &quot; a &quot; thinks he does .
what are you talking about ?
i got a text saying to call off my &apos; techno @-@ boy @-@ toy . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; maybe just got their wires crossed .
yeah , maybe they &apos;re just like a step behind or something .
since when is &quot; a &quot; ever a step behind ?
where are you guys going ?
uh , we have chem .
um , we &apos;ll talk to you later , okay ?
look , hanna , i know it &apos;s not great timing .
where are you going ? to hang out with your family ?
what ?
spencer , i used to be a member .
i know you guys are pissed at me for destroying the flash drive ,
but you can &apos;t just shut me out .
i did this to protect caleb ,
and i would do it for any one of you if i could .
it just feels so weird watching them all celebrate
and not being a part of it .
what can i do ? steal their swimsuits ?
no , no , no , drain the pool .
no , no , no , i got it , i got it .
fill their shampoo bottles with nair .
talk to me .
no , making them bald would
actually give them an edge on the competition .
trust me , i &apos;ve already considered it .
what ? i &apos;m kidding .
but thanks for offering .
it &apos;s my mom .
so ... she &apos;s coming tomorrow ?
yeah . i &apos;ve been missing her a lot lately .
does she still hate me ?
she never hated you .
she hated me liking girls , but she &apos;s fine with that now .
you sure about that ?
&apos;cause the last time i your mom ,
she was getting me hauled off to druggie boot @-@ camp .
okay , she didn &apos;t know
that your parents were gonna send you there .
besides , she &apos;s a completely different person now .
i &apos;ll believe it when i see it .
so you moved here from baltimore ?
yeah , so i can still go home on weekends
and visit my friends .
that &apos;s nice .
do you have any family in maine , by any chance ?
nope . no , all in maryland .
have you ever been to maine ? the northeast harbor area ?
nope .
so , kate , will you be joining any clubs or sports teams ?
yeah , i was actually thinking--
debate !
orchestra .
sorry , i thought i must &apos;ve seen you at a debate .
are you sure that we haven &apos;t met before ?
pretty sure .
so i &apos;m gonna head to class early
and introduce myself to the teacher .
i will see you all soon .
bye .
what are you doing ?
i know her . i know i know her .
i just don &apos;t know where i know her from .
can you back off ?
i &apos;m not gonna let her complain to my dad
that my friends are giving her the fourth degree .
it &apos;s the third degree .
whatever . just stop giving her degrees , okay ?
so did you ?
mom !
look how gorgeous you are !
i feel like i haven &apos;t seen you in ages !
it &apos;s only been a couple weeks .
now wait a minute .
are you getting taller , or am i just getting shorter ?
shorter ,
no .
and early .
i thought you weren &apos;t getting in until later tonight .
i know , but i wanted to surprise you .
chocolate macadamia ?
yes .
and don &apos;t eat it yet ,
because i made us an early reservation at the grille .
hey , do you wanna invite the girls ?
i think they have plans tonight , but ...
is there someone else you &apos;d like to invite ?
someone special ? maybe someone new ?
in a way .
it &apos;s maya .
we started seeing each other again .
is she going to school here ?
no , radford .
her family moved to radford , so she &apos;s going to school there .
well , why don &apos;t you ask her if she wants to join us for dinner .
really ? i know you weren &apos;t crazy about maya .
honey , there was a lot going on back then .
i feel like i really never gave her a chance ,
and it &apos;d be nice to have another opportunity .
hey , come on , you guys . let &apos;s go .
hanna , come on .
spence , you coming ?
uh , yeah , i &apos;ll see you guys in there .
having trouble ?
it &apos;ll come to me .
you know , it &apos;s funny .
i can remember every single locker combination i &apos;ve ever had ,
going all the way back to middle school .
impressive . but ultimately useless .
but that &apos;s why i knew i &apos;d eventually get it .
shekomeko horse ranch ,
summer of 2006 .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
my sister melissa was a junior counselor that year ,
and you were in her bunk .
fine . you win .
we went to camp together .
and , yes , i &apos;m her .
i &apos;m exactly who you think i am .
so what is it gonna take ?
what do you mean ?
for you to keep this to yourself .
do you want money ?
i &apos;m not gonna tell anyone .
but just so you know ,
melissa sent me a bunk photo that year .
so if you being nice to hanna is just an act ,
you &apos;d better keep it up .
why are you giving me a break ?
because judging from the way that you treated hanna ,
everybody &apos;s gonna see how ugly you are without any help from me .
if you have any trouble with the app ,
just give me a call . i put my digits in there .
cool , thanks .
emily .
hi , maya . it &apos;s great to see you .
you look beautiful .
you know what they say about clean living .
well , whatever you &apos;re doing , it &apos;s working for you .
thanks .
i &apos;m just gonna let her know that we &apos;re ready , okay ?
so when did noel become your phone repair guy ?
oh , he saw me struggling and offered to help .
he &apos;s really sweet .
no , he &apos;s not .
but his smile takes up half his face ,
so i see how you could be confused .
all right , ladies ,
i think our table &apos;s ready .
nice work , pam . you say jump and they say how high , huh ?
okay , so my dad said that he &apos;d pick us up at 11 : 00 .
do you wanna meet back here at quarter till ?
sounds good .
great . well , have a good night .
you , too .
thanks .
actually , my plans kinda got cancelled .
so i was just gonna wait here till you got back .
you &apos;re kidding .
no , it &apos;s fine , really . i brought magazines .
i just didn &apos;t wanna bail on you .
i didn &apos;t wanna bail on you .
my plans got cancelled , too .
seriously ?
well , why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i don &apos;t know . why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because i didn &apos;t wanna ruin your night .
same here .
okay , well , should i call my dad and have him pick us up early ?
look , seeing as we were both gonna kill time here anyway ,
you wanna order a large to split ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m not really--
i &apos;ll even get half plain , half green peppers .
your favorite , right ?
i cannot believe that you actually remember that .
you know what else i remember ?
you , uh , used to be kind of a mean player .
still got the chops ?
i kinda just wanted to sit and read .
oh , so you don &apos;t .
okay , let &apos;s go . you &apos;re on .
you &apos;re dead , by the way .
so , mom , maya joined the jazz band at her new school ,
and they &apos;re really good .
wonderful .
thank you .
you know , actually , when i was in college ,
i had a huge poster of miles davis right over my bed .
i absolutely worshipped that man .
really ? that &apos;s surprising .
really ? i mean , what kind of music
would you think i would have been listening to ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
classical music , i guess . something very sophisticated .
well , i think jazz is sophisticated .
oh , me , too , but , you know ,
jazz musicians are also known for ...
so , uh , maya ,
do you enjoy the people
that you &apos;re playing with in your jazz band ?
yeah , they &apos;re great .
sorry about that .
it &apos;s just my stalker .
excuse me .
oh , nothing . i &apos;m just kidding .
i dated this guy at true north ,
and he &apos;s having trouble accepting that it &apos;s over .
but it &apos;s cool . everything &apos;s fine .
well , i &apos;m glad to hear that .
what &apos;d you pick ?
ooh ! the notebook .
um , i &apos;m actually trying to wean myself off of that one .
right , no , we don &apos;t have to watch that one .
you know what ? no , let &apos;s watch it .
i &apos;m just really glad that you came over .
so i &apos;m not in the doghouse with you guys anymore ?
no , you never were .
well , good ,
because i really don &apos;t need to stress out about that
on top of all this kate crap .
hanna , i really don &apos;t think that you need to worry about kate .
she &apos;s been nothing but nice to you , right ?
oh , yeah , but it &apos;s a trap .
do you remember in bio we learned about those animals
that can change their appearance to look harmless
and then they lull their prey into a false sense of security
and then they just bite their heads off ?
that &apos;s kate .
hanna , do not lose sleep over this girl .
no , it &apos;s those fish ! what are they called ?
fangblennies .
yes .
kate is a fangblenny .
no .
she &apos;s a boil n &apos; baggy .
i don &apos;t remember that one . is that like a blowfish ?
i am showing you this to
prove that you have nothing to worry about .
did you hear me ?
what are those ? !
they &apos;re bug bites .
god , it looks like something
laid eggs on her face and then exploded .
ugh . i want more .
melissa said everyone felt sorry for her for like a minute ,
and she was the one with the skin condition ,
but she treated everyone else like lepers .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s an i.d.
how did you get it ?
caleb came over after you destroyed the flash drive ,
and he offered to help us as long as we kept it a secret .
from me ?
i &apos;m so sorry , hanna .
no , please , just let me explain--
no , don &apos;t even try to apologize .
hanna , no , come on , stay and talk to me .
i am such an idiot !
this whole time i &apos;m worried about kate backstabbing me ,
i didn &apos;t even realize that you were holding a knife .
hanna . hanna !
ok , i &apos;ll be right back . would either of you two like some desert
maybe . is there a menu ?
thank you . we &apos;re fine .
okay . i &apos;m gonna go find our waiter and get the bill .
what the hell was that ?
i thought we could get a brownie to split .
stop . why were you acting like that ?
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s been
freezing me out for the last 30 minutes .
because you completely torpedoed dinner .
how do you see that ?
you kept making jokes about weed .
i made one joke and--
and every time i tried to changed the subject ,
you brought it back to true north .
i asked you to start over with my mom .
and that &apos;s what i was doing .
i was trying to be honest .
being honest is fine .
you were trying to get a rise out of her .
why else would you bring up dating that guy ?
i finally got my mom to come on board with me dating girls
and you bring that up ?
it &apos;s confusing for her .
is the fact that i dated a guy confusing for your mom ...
or for you ?
all right , we &apos;re all set .
i &apos;m glad you could join us .
thank you for inviting me . it &apos;s an honor .
no , it &apos;s a bunch of boring old farts discussing dead authors .
but it &apos;s nice to have some young blood in the mix .
i &apos;ll admit , i have an ulterior motive for dragging you here .
i &apos;ve recommended you for an associate dean &apos;s position
at the new hollis satellite school .
i don &apos;t know what to say . i had no idea .
it &apos;s an honor .
if the board approves , and i can &apos;t see why they wouldn &apos;t ,
you would need to be in louisiana by the beginning of the month .
i assumed that the extension program was in philadelphia .
no , it &apos;s in new orleans .
we &apos;re participating in a grant program
set up to revitalize the city .
well , i think i &apos;ll need a few days to think about it .
ezra , i &apos;ll be candid .
you weren &apos;t on the short @-@ list for this position .
it &apos;s only because byron montgomery
insisted you were perfect for the job
that i even considered it .
i don &apos;t get it .
you knew how long it took me to trust you again .
why would you ruin that ?
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d find out .
wow .
wrong answer .
just let me finish , okay ?
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d find out until
i solved whatever it is you guys are trying to solve .
i don &apos;t need that .
i needed you not to go behind my back .
hanna , i know that you were trying to protect me ,
but i was worried about you .
you &apos;re not the only one i &apos;m trying to protect , caleb .
last year , it was really bad for me and my mom .
what do you mean ?
no one really even knew because ...
i was still wearing the same clothes and driving the same car ,
but we were totally broke .
what &apos;s broke ?
it might mean something
completely different for you than it does to me .
we almost lost our house .
my mom got money from the bank to tide us over .
do you still need--
no .
that &apos;s not why i &apos;m telling you .
my mom didn &apos;t borrow money from the bank .
she stole it .
i &apos;ve never told anyone that ,
not even my friends .
thank you for trusting me .
i promise i won &apos;t tell anybody .
but someone else knows .
and they &apos;re holding it over me .
who ? who ?
is it jenna ?
i don &apos;t know who it is .
but it &apos;s their phone that you &apos;re working on .
winning really brings out the nerd in you , huh ?
okay , i &apos;m gonna ignore all of your hostility right now
because i know that it comes from a place of shame .
how about some soda ?
that &apos;s cool . i got .
so what happened to that theatre guy ?
uh , he couldn &apos;t make it tonight .
how long have you two been , uh ...
we don &apos;t need to talk about that .
rematch ?
gonna massacre you again .
yes !
what were you doing ?
just knocking on the door .
who were you looking for ?
jenna . have you seen her ?
no , not for a while .
what do you wanna see her about ?
that &apos;s between me and her .
well , if you &apos;re looking to get your old job back ,
it &apos;s too late .
she found someone else .
no .
actually , i came by to tell
her to stop threatening hanna and her friends .
you better be a lot scarier than that
if you want jenna to take you seriously .
i &apos;m gonna go now .
yeah , you do that .
don &apos;t slam the door in my face .
i wasn &apos;t going to .
what i did , it wasn &apos;t an act of betrayal .
it was an act of desperation .
we &apos;ve all been desperate .
that &apos;s not an excuse .
okay , i know .
it &apos;s just that &quot; a &quot; has taken everything from me .
please , i can &apos;t lose you , too .
you haven &apos;t .
so my dad just texted , and he &apos;s almost here .
are you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
what is that from ?
oh , it &apos;s nothing . i play touch football .
so does my little brother ,
and i &apos;ve never seen a bruise like that on him before .
please don &apos;t say anything .
holden , that &apos;s a serious bruise .
promise me you won &apos;t say anything .
i was so stupid .
i thought if we could use the phone
to nail &quot; a &quot; once and for all ,
it &apos;d be worth the risk .
makes sense .
i don &apos;t know .
we got nothing from the i.d.
it was a complete dead end .
i &apos;m not so sure .
i didn &apos;t tell you this earlier &apos; cause i was mad ,
but i &apos;ve seen ali with dark hair before .
you have ?
yeah , about two years ago .
vivian , listen to me . it &apos;s fierce .
can you please get miss darkbloom a cup of coffee ?
it &apos;s your first time here , isn &apos;t , honey ?
yeah .
okay .
you want cream or sugar , vvivian ?
no thanks , i don &apos;t like it sweet .
ali ?
hanna ?
what are you doing here ?
my mom made me an appointment .
i didn &apos;t know you came here .
your hair looks great .
i didn &apos;t even recognize you .
just trying something new , testing the waters .
here &apos;s the thing .
i &apos;m pretending to be someone else , so play along .
okay ...
but why ?
because i &apos;m bored . i do it a lot .
you should try it some time .
i mean , aren &apos;t you just sick and tired of being you ?
i guess i never told you guys before
because i thought it was just typical ali weirdness .
what is it ?

i stole it ... from ali .

i didn &apos;t really steal it , i borrowed it ,
but i kept seeing her with it , and i was curious .
i was supposed to give it back to her ,
but i never got the chance .
hey , sorry i missed your call .
it &apos;s kind of early .
i know . i wanted to talk before school .
the thing is ...
i do have a problem with you dating that guy ,
but not for the reasons you think .
i have a problem with you dating anyone but me ,
and knowing you &apos;re into guys and girls ,
it just doubles the amount of people i have to compete with .
trust me , you have no competition .
and you were right .
as much as i &apos;d like to be zen about it ,
i &apos;m still mad at your mom for busting me .
so now what ?

yeah .
oh , my gosh .
this is so beautiful .
my way of saying sorry for ruining dinner .
if the sharks won &apos;t let you back in the water ,
i &apos;ll bring the water to you .
i can &apos;t believe you would do all this for me .
i admit , i like to live life in the grey area ,
but the way i feel about you is crystal clear .
i love you , emily .
