what are you thinking ?
i &apos;m thinking it was the accountant .
in the law office .
with the illegal wire transfer ?
either that , or colonel mustard in the library .
we can pull prints on the candlestick .
let &apos;s grab his company &apos;s financial records from last year
they &apos;re on file .
you want me to do it ?
we have clerks for that .
i got something better . i got you .
okay .
sticking around , huh ?
yeah .
hey , is it true you once sent champagne to a surveillance van ?
that &apos;s the rumor .
been checking up on me ?
you were part of my thesis at quantico .
really ? how &apos;d we do ?
94 .
not bad .
find anything interesting ?
truth or rumor ?
is there a difference ?
well , the counterfeit stock certificates were your only conviction ,
but you &apos;re implicated in at least a dozen other confidence
schemes , frauds , and forgeries .
is that why you asked to be reassigned to the white @-@ collar unit ?
yeah , you know , i wasn &apos;t gonna pass a chance
to work with someone i &apos;ve admired since college .
hey , play your cards right ,
i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll make a case or two .
oh , honey , i was talking about agent burke .
he caught you twice . right ?
hey . hey , maybe you can help me out
&apos;cause i &apos;m looking for some records here .
yeah , we got clerks for that .
uh , peter .
yeah ?
yeah , your wife &apos;s here . she &apos;s not alone .
she look upset to you ?
ah , they look -- they both look upset .
you know , a buddy of mine ,
he always kept a separate cellphone --
one for the wife , one for the girlfriend .
well , helps avoid this kind of crossover .
that &apos;s not my girlfriend , okay ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t have a girlfriend .
that &apos;s el &apos;s friend dana .
they &apos;ve known each other since high school .
hi , honey .
we need to talk .
okay , thanks , jones . that will be all .
have a seat , honey .
so , why &apos;s dana here ?
is she okay ?
no . it &apos;s actually about her husband , john .
hot @-@ wings guy ?
remember , he made those hot wings at the barbecue ,
the cooper barbecue , a while back .
right . him .
thought he was stationed overseas ?
he finished his tour last month .
what &apos;s the problem ?
well , this morning , the fbi issued a warrant for his arrest .
all right . what &apos;s the last name ?
mitchell .
mitchell .
what happened ?
some stolen gold or something in a storage shed .
they think he brought it over . dana came to me for help .
she has no idea why he &apos;s a suspect .
i think i do .
well , what is it ?
it &apos;s gold artifacts from iraq .
got his prints all over the place , hair evidence .
el , this doesn &apos;t look good .
found that file !
this can wait .
no , neal , come in .
now , neal ...
just because someone &apos;s accused of doing something ,
that doesn &apos;t mean that that person is guilty , right ?
define &quot; guilty . &quot;
you really think he &apos;s the best person to ask ?
neal .
i suppose it &apos;s possible .
see ? that &apos;s what i thought .
this says , &quot; where about &apos;s unknown . &quot;
is he on the run ?
he &apos;s at his brother &apos;s .
i didn &apos;t know the address .
if you &apos;re keeping that information , that &apos;s aiding and abetting .
okay , i think i grabbed the wrong file .
i &apos;m goona get the right--
no . stay . my turn .
if we have your prints and hair on the scene
and you &apos;re on the run , are you guilty ?
oh , now he &apos;s the best person to ask ?
honestly , i think your friend should turn himself in .
i completely agree with you .
that &apos;s why i told dana to tell him what to do --
turn himself in .
so , he is turning himself in ?
yes . he &apos;s going to be turning himself in to you .
uh , peter , thank you .
god , do i feel guilty .
you think he did it ?
artifacts from the royal cemetery crypts of ur in egypt .
1,000 @-@ year @-@ old gold .
a lot of money is always a lot of motive .
that &apos;s a shame .
apparently , he melted some of it down .
john .
peter .
i want you to know i didn &apos;t do this . i was set up .
your prints were all over the gold , john .
my prints ?
we got to go .
listen . please .
look , my lawyer said i shouldn &apos;t say a word ,
but when i was overseas ,
a guy asked me to help him bring some goods back to the states .
i said no .
john ...
his name is ames . it &apos;s patrick ames .
he &apos;s in the state department . just look into it . please .
i will .
oh , my god .
hey , that was genuine surprise on mitchell &apos;s face
when you told him his prints were on the gold .
i noticed that .
but that doesn &apos;t get him off the hook .
there &apos;s something else .
what ?
before i say anything , what &apos;s the statute of limitations --
just tell me .
you can &apos;t melt down precious metals like gold
without getting splash blisters on your arms ,
no matter how careful you are .
well , mitchell may be burn @-@ free ,
but that doesn &apos;t make him innocent .
maybe we should check out this ames guy .
already did .
he was working for the state department ,
overseeing reconstruction in mosul
a few months back .
where is he now ?
working for a private security
contractor right here in new york .
sounds like he &apos;s done well for himself .
yeah . i &apos;m gonna go see how well .
all right .
every room , every child
gets that view every morning .
mr. ames ?
am i interrupting ?
peter burke , fbi .
if you wouldn &apos;t mind just waiting for me by the cars ,
we &apos;ll finish this in just a minute .
if you don &apos;t mind ,
i have a few questions
about some stolen iraqi artifacts .
oh , right . i had read
that some important pieces were recently recovered .
that &apos;s right . we have a suspect in custody .
well , good . i &apos;m glad to hear justice will prevail .
given your past experience there ,
i thought you might have some insight
as to how a bunch of gold from mosul
finds its way to
a storage shed near fort monmouth .
of course .
call my office , we &apos;ll set up a meeting .
sure .
there was one other thing . the suspect says you framed him .
any idea why he might say that ?
i wish i knew .
is there something else , agent burke ?
nope . i got everything i need .
jones , have every recovered artifact
moved to our office a.s.a.p.
i want to re @-@ examine the evidence .
where &apos;s peter ? i thought he called this meeting ?
he &apos;s been poring over this stuff
with the evidence recovery team
since he saw splash blisters on ames &apos; bodyguard .
said something about a breakthrough .
i &apos;m looking for clues .
yeah , you &apos;re looking for your
next jail sentence . oh , my god .
didn &apos;t you just join this unit ?
yeah , and i didn &apos;t even have to go to prison first .
so , if you were gonna frame somebody , how would you do it ?
i &apos;ve never framed anybody . only been framed .
yeah ? what for ?
counterfeiting stock certificates
and about a dozen other confidence
schemes , frauds , and forgeries .
hear you had a breakthrough .
i got something . notice the prints .
very clean .
maybe a little too clean .
they &apos;re all mitchell &apos;s ?
yep . notice anything else ?
they &apos;re all left @-@ handed .
that &apos;s improbable .
it &apos;s impossible .
what does it mean ?
i don &apos;t know .
what , you think the prints were planted ?
well , it wouldn &apos;t be hard , would it ?
don &apos;t look at me .
all right , it wouldn &apos;t be that hard .
it starts by getting a clean set of prints ,
and somebody got mitchell &apos;s .
but only his left hand . why only the left ?
how was the gold found in the first place ?
anonymous tip .
there &apos;s a red flag .
mm . could be .
easy . easy there , tiger .
shouldn &apos;t you be getting home to elizabeth ?
dana &apos;s been with us for a few days .
oh . how &apos;s that going ?
she &apos;s been through a lot .
no , this has got to be rough on her . it &apos;s got to be .
look , i try to be a good person .
you have your moments .
yeah , it &apos;s just i --
is it the crying ?
yeah .
i can handle everything else but women crying .
that &apos;s all . i don &apos;t know what to do with it .
i try to fix it .
i mean , with you i &apos;d give you a slug on the shoulder
and i &apos;d tell you to cowboy up .
we got the print theory .
that might cheer her up .
yeah , it could be something
if i can link it to ames or the bodyguard .
what ?
we &apos;ve been here an hour , but in that whole time ,
you &apos;ve only touched these bottles with your right hand .
mitchell had drinks with whoever lifted the prints .
can you ask him ?
the marshals are sitting on him .
i could take the time to reach out ,
file the proper paperwork ,
go through the usual channels tomorrow .
or you could just ask his wife ...
hey , honey .
hey , honey .
hey , dana . how you holding up ?
it &apos;s hard , you know .
the not knowing that &apos;s killing me .
any news ?
well , which do you want first ?
the good news or the bad news ?
there &apos;s bad news ?
not more than there has been .
he &apos;s still charged . it still looks pretty bad .
i &apos;ll go with the good news .
there are some evidence anomalies .
someone may have planted his prints on the gold .
so , you mean he really was framed ?
it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m curious . did he have drinks with anyone recently ?
the prints are crisp ,
which would indicate a glass or a bottle ,
so it was probably for a beer .
it &apos;s not okay , really .
yes , it is . this is the good @-@ news part .
can i talk to you for a second ?
i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll be right back .
what did i do ?
i don &apos;t know , but you see she &apos;s crying .
yeah , i see that she &apos;s crying !
i need to know if john met someone for a drink .
maybe he didn &apos;t tell her .
does she suspect him of cheating ?
yeah , now i &apos;m gonna let you go talk to her .
this is important .
go upstairs .
upstairs .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , it &apos;s okay .
sometimes peter doesn &apos;t realize that he &apos;s an fbi agent .
no , it wasn &apos;t peter .
it &apos;s ...
john and i had a fight before all this happened about ...
a woman who took him for a drink .
john &apos;s not the cheating type .
what if he &apos;s not the guy that i think he is ?
what if he really did steal that stuff ? i mean ...
look , you heard peter , okay ? evidence was planted .
okay ?
but who was this woman who took him out for a drink ?
i don &apos;t know . she &apos;s a journalist .
she , uh ... she was embedded with john &apos;s unit .
and she called about a month ago .
and she wanted to do a follow @-@ up story .
something like , uh ...
&quot; the life of a returning vet &quot; kind of thing .
wait , so , they went for a beer ?
yeah .
and i was mad at him
for not telling me about it beforehand instead of after .
yeah .
that night , john was more mad about his yankee cap
than he was about the fact
that i had just accused him of cheating on me .
what happened to the yankee cap ?
i don &apos;t know . he left it at the bar . it never turned up .
well , the hat would explain the hair fibers . yeah .
you had elizabeth talk to her ?
i thought some female intuition would be helpful .
dana started crying , didn &apos;t she ?
i didn &apos;t even do anything . i had no idea what went wrong .
so , who &apos;s this other woman ?
this is alisha teagan , segment producer .
she was a reporter embedded with mitchell &apos;s unit .
all right , so , she invites mitchell out for a beer .
let &apos;s say she takes that opportunity
to lift the prints off of the bottle .
she grabs the baseball hat as an added bonus .
oh , yeah . toss in a little dna evidence
to really lock the case .
right . now , how do we connect her to ames ?
do they know each other ?
other than the fact that they were in iraq , there &apos;s nothing .
if ames stole the gold , he isn &apos;t gonna ship it himself .
he &apos;s gonna get someone else
so that his hands stay clean in case they get intercepted .
press credentials aren &apos;t a bad way to get by customs .
let &apos;s go talk to her .
wait here . i &apos;ll check in .
i &apos;m here to see alisha teagan .
she &apos;s not in yet .
agent burke . fbi .
sorry , sir . would you care to wait upstairs ?
she should be in any minute .
yeah , why don &apos;t i do that ?
be sure to let her know
agent burke with the fbi is here to talk to her .
i &apos;ll be sure to do that .
thank you .
so , what &apos;s it like to be on camera ?
oh , i &apos;m not on camera .
really ?
&apos;cause your badge here says , uh , &quot; studio access . &quot;
i &apos;m a publicist , actually .
wow . how is it up there ?
cutthroat .
looks like they just moved my meeting to 12 : 30 .
excuse me .
hey .
peter ? where are you ?
upstairs . on my way to alisha &apos;s office .
thank you .
you left me in the lobby ?
well , you looked busy .
listen , alisha &apos;s on her way in .
i want you to watch how she reacts
when the guard tells her there &apos;s an fbi agent waiting for her .
hi , phil .
morning .
miss teagan , uh , there &apos;s an fbi agent here to see you .
sorry ?
an fbi agent . said his name was burke .
uh , just tell him today &apos;s not a good day .
oh , he &apos;s already upstairs .
did he say what he wanted ?
all he said was to let you know he &apos;s here .
mm , thanks .
hi , phil .
morning , judy .
phil .
morning , christian .
hey , phil .
morning .
oh . i ran out of hands .
my card &apos;s in my pocket . here , you just want to grab that there .
just grab that for me .
uh ... don &apos;t worry about it .
all right , thanks , bud .
this is neal . leave a message .
neal , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re up to , but whatever it is , stop .
morning .
hi , kim . how you doing ?
hi .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve seen you around here before .
oh , i &apos;m gary ... the , uh ... new sports anchor .
new sports anchor ?
new guy brings the coffee , right ?
thanks , gary .
what about leonard ?
oh , you didn &apos;t hear .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s why the meeting got moved to 12 : 30 .
uh , don &apos;t ... say anything to leonard .
great work , champ .
alisha teagan .
oh , you , uh , must be agent burke .
i hope this won &apos;t take long . i &apos;m on deadline .
have a seat .
i &apos;m curious about the piece
that you did on captain jonathan mitchell .
oh , mitchell ? of course .
what was your impression of him ?
he seemed like a good soldier .
that it ?
to be honest , i didn &apos;t find him that memorable .
then why &apos;d you have a follow @-@ up on him ?
i was doing a series of segments on vets returning home ,
how they &apos;re readjusting to life after the military .
how did he seem to you ?
he seemed to be doing fine .
he could get back home .
so , you took captain mitchell out for a beer ?
yeah , he was one of several soldiers i was , uh , considering .
when you say &quot; considering , &quot; what exactly do you mean by that ?
well , we wanna get a sense of what they &apos;re going through ,
if reality looked up to their expectations .
excuse me . did they change the code again ?
you could use mine .
there you go .
thanks .
what exactly are you investigating , agent burke ?
captain mitchell was arrested yesterday
for the theft of iraqi antiquities .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
so , there was nothing particularly special about mitchell ?
no . in fact , i &apos;m really sorry i couldn &apos;t help you further .
why the rush ?
i told you . i &apos;m on deadline .
now , if you have no other questions ,
i , uh , would like to get back to work .
wait .
my card . when you think of something else .
if i think of something else .
what was that about ?
you had me off my game .
you told me to watch her reaction . that &apos;s what i did .
by breaking and entering ?
phil let me in .
who &apos;s phil ?
the guy at the door . i ...
okay , you want to know what i found ?
no .
she got rattled when she heard &quot; fbi . &quot;
she went to her desk and locked something in the top drawer .
oh , god .
i didn &apos;t steal it . i photocopied it .
it &apos;s a pawnshop ticket . bet i know what she was pawning .
no . i didn &apos;t see this . you didn &apos;t see this .
but i did see it .
hey , moz . i got a favor to ask you .
i need you to check out a pawnshop ticket for me .
how &apos;s she holding up ?
as good as can be expected .
um , do you think we could finish watching the movie ?
little girl time ?
yeah .
yeah , i &apos;ll find something to do .
oh , you &apos;re a good man .
ah , that &apos;s what i keep telling people .
have fun .
&quot; x &quot; marks the spot .
kate loves the classics .
moz , hey .
you nearby ?
did your suit put a tail on me ?
what ? no , i think i figured out the map on the bottle .
it &apos;s a bordeaux label . bordeaux with an &quot; x . &quot;
&quot; x &quot; marks the spot .
ah . you know , kate loves the classics .
yes , she does .
i found a bit of treasure , too . on my way to show you .
hurry up .
i walk at a delicate pace .
well , that was fast .
yep , coming .
hey , my --
my man .
expecting somebody ?
n @-@ not at all .
good .
come right on in .
wow . unbelievable .
last time we had a drink , we made a breakthrough .
hoping tonight we can solve the whole damn case .
so , dana &apos;s still at the house ?
yup .
here &apos;s to freeing captain john mitchell .
so i can go back home .
i &apos;ll drink to that .
i &apos;ll get that . it &apos;s probably june .
photocopy of a pawn ticket -- but i got this coin .
what ?
sorry , mr. haversham . june isn &apos;t here at the moment .
oh , well ... uh , too bad .
um , tell her i look forward
to our next round of drinks
and parcheesi .
yep .
hang on a second .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
apparently i &apos;m interrupting something .
who are you ?
i &apos;m the neighbor ...
dan ... te haversham .
dante haversham .
and you &apos;re dating june ?
uh , uh , courting ... courting .
yeah , w @-@ what could i say ?
she likes a little , uh ... cream in her coffee .
you really want to keep this up ?
no , i don &apos;t . you &apos;re right . this is --
no . i know .
how about i just call you mr. haversham ?
come on in .
thought you &apos;d be taller .
me too .
well , you &apos;re here .
have a drink .
oh , no , i ... i don &apos;t drink .
well , you do tonight .
gin &apos;s good .
i ... i don &apos;t get it .
girl leaves nothing but an empty bottle behind .
at least kate could have left a full one .
guys , i &apos;m right here .
mm . fair enough , fair enough .
man , look at that view .
is this why you guys do it ?
is this what it &apos;s all about ?
it &apos;s not about the stuff .
moz ...
it &apos;s about doing what we want to do .
who cares about 9 @-@ to @-@ 5 &apos;s and 401k &apos;s ?
playing by the rules only makes borders
that just take away everything
that &apos;s good about living life .
moz , moz ... you lived in a storage unit .
yeah , but i lived there , man . i lived .
long as i don &apos;t have to live
under anyone else &apos;s time or dime , i &apos;m a free man .
i can do whatever i want .
like going to the pawnshop and getting
that coin you have in your pocket ?
come on . let &apos;s see it .
oh , it &apos;s a hell of a thing .
islamic dinar from the abbasid dynasty .
last seen in the museum in mosul .
i really shouldn &apos;t even know about this .
alisha &apos;s guilty , isn &apos;t she ?
looks like it .
i &apos;m holding damning evidence ,
and i can &apos;t do a damn thing with it .
your rules , tin man , not mine .
come on , peter , give me the coin .
i can see it now ... &quot; fbi agent illegally obtains evidence .
news at 11 : 00 . &quot;
it &apos;s a hell of a story . too bad she can &apos;t report it .
maybe she can .
great story on the governor .
teagan !
yeah ? got a story for you .
guy says he wants to talk about a high @-@ level cover @-@ up
in iraq involving a soldier .
says he &apos;ll only talk to you .
why me ?
maybe he &apos;s a fan of your work .
okay . got a number ? i &apos;ll give him a call .
got something better . he &apos;s here .
mcqueen ! let &apos;s set up to get this guy on tape .
we rolling ? oh , hi . uh , alisha teagan .
good to meet you . i &apos;m a huge fan .
oh , thank you . - wow , you look --
you look even better in person .
wow , thank you . you &apos;re all miked up .
let &apos;s , uh , get started .
your name ?
ah , we &apos;ll get to that .
just relax . take a deep breath .
so , why don &apos;t we , uh ...
why don &apos;t we start at the beginning ?
okay , yeah .
once upon a time in iraq , there were two people .
one was greedy
and a thief .
the other was pretty and opportunistic .
together , they found a great deal of treasure .
i think this is something
we should be discussing off @-@ camera .
oh , wait , no . that &apos;s the prologue .
i &apos;m getting to the setup .
they smuggled that treasure back here .
it went off without a hitch .
but they needed a fall guy --
you know , somebody to take the heat off them
so they could sell the treasure without interference .
that fall guy is a soldier you know --
john mitchell .
well ... unfortunately ,
your story is missing something very important -- proof .
oh , i &apos;ve got proof , yeah .
recognize this ?
what this story is missing is an ending .
i &apos;m not sure what happens to mitchell .
the outcome of his life --
it may as well be decided on the toss of a coin .
want to call it for me ?
turn off the cameras .
turn off the cameras !
i want immunity .
you &apos;re funny .
what you get depends on what you give me .
ames looted saddam &apos;s museum .
he set the whole thing up .
all i did was -- was help him
transport it back to the states .
you were his mule ? what was your cut ?
well , it doesn &apos;t matter . i haven &apos;t seen a dime .
not even this really old dime ?
prosecution hasn &apos;t taken immunity off the table .
i needed the money .
oh , i &apos;ll bet . i looked at your portfolio .
you lost a lot when the market crashed .
yeah . i lost enough .
look , i still had access to the gold .
so i took some of the smaller pieces and turned them over .
when you got scared that you were leaving a paper trail ,
you decided to set up mitchell as a fall guy .
i didn &apos;t want to set him up . ames did .
all you did was get the prints and the hat .
what i want to know
is why you melted some of the pieces down .
he thought if we made it look
like most of the gold was gone ,
you guys wouldn &apos;t spend so much time searching for it ,
even after mitchell was locked up .
where &apos;s the gold now ?
i don &apos;t know .
he moved it on you ?
yeah .
i swear . i don &apos;t know where it is .
then you &apos;re gonna help us find it .
you &apos;re gonna tell ames that the fbi &apos;s been poking around .
we &apos;ve been talking to him , too , so he &apos;ll believe you .
he won &apos;t trust me .
he will if you tell him
that the case against mitchell is falling apart
and that he needs to unload the gold immediately .
what if he gets spooked , okay , and wants to wait ?
then you &apos;ll have to convince him that you found
a private buyer .
a very rich , very discreet buyer .
so , ames is willing to meet you
at a private gallery later today ?
apparently , i &apos;m a wealthy buyer .
and this is your car for the day .
you &apos;re not -- you &apos;re not kidding .
it &apos;s a mercedes .
oh , this isn &apos;t even an s @-@ class .
i need to look like i can drop a few million on antiquities .
this says , &quot; look what i kept in the divorce . &quot;
really ? you can &apos;t make this work ?
what kind of a con man are you ?
the neal caffrey i did my thesis on could make this work .
moz . wake up .
leave me alone .
come on . come on , moz , come on .
did you draw on my face ?
what ? no .
ames is meeting with me today .
got to go in as a serious high roller .
need a car .
i &apos;ll get my slim jim .
no . can &apos;t steal it .
yeah , we &quot; can &apos;t steal it . &quot;
excuse me , sir .
could you step away from this car ? thank you .
yo , you need something ?
yeah . captain told you i was coming , right ?
says fbi .
what you talking about ?
one of your limos was involved in a 418 last night .
i &apos;m supposed to bring it back to the forensic motor pool .
what &apos;s the plate on that ?
uh , xc7.32w.
we &apos;re cleaning it now .
griggs , get this guy out of here .
yo , i didn &apos;t get a call about any of this .
you , beat it .
is that our vehicle ?
whoa . we got gunshot residue .
looks like it &apos;s been snowing back here .
how many of your guys touched this car ?
we &apos;re a cleaning company .
oh , really ?
okay , there &apos;s two ways we can do this .
one , i take the car back with me ,
no one gets asked any questions .
the second way , we assume
whatever &apos;s in the backseat belongs to one of you .
that &apos;s above my pay grade , pal .
take it .
griggs , give him a receipt .
say no to drugs , chief .
whatever .
oh , we got a high roller coming through .
i thought we gave him a mercedes .
yeah , i guess he made it work .
god , that driver looks familiar .
is he one of ours ?
that &apos;s haversham . good man .
relax , you &apos;re gonna be fine .
yeah , you have no idea how dangerous ames can be .
it &apos;s just a game .
never let them see you sweat , right ?
alisha , you look lovely .
this is the gentleman i was telling you about .
this is my business manager .
charmed .
likewise .
come in .
enjoy .
how long have you been collecting antiquities ?
years .
i also admire the occasional reproduction .
so , you &apos;re familiar with ptolemaic period , then ?

good eye .
