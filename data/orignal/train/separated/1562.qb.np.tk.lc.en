that was liam .
foster brother you told me about ?
he forced me to have sex with him .
it wasn &apos;t my choice , it wasn &apos;t my fault .
11 @-@ 99 , officer down !
663 coronado street !
i get that it &apos;s forbidden for foster kids to hook up with the other kids ,
but it &apos;s not like they &apos;re keeping you .
if you &apos;re into brandon , then go for it .
we chose you , and you chose us .
dna doesn &apos;t make a family , love does .
but you don &apos;t think your daughter has a right to marry lena ?
i believe that marriage is between a man and a woman .
will you marry me ?
i thought you &apos;d never ask .
more ?
come on , it &apos;s not like i &apos;m running a sweatshop here .
i just don &apos;t understand
why you want to use all this dirty old silverware .
i like the history , i like the story behind it .
like , i wonder if someone died
from the black plague after using this knife ?
we washed it !
don &apos;t knock the old stuff , kid .
you &apos;ll be old yourself before you know it .
you tell him , grandma .
ok , here we go .
stef , give me that !
what ?
you &apos;re not supposed to be lifting anything heavy ...
it &apos;s not heavy . it &apos;s been weeks .
honey , i &apos;m fine .
when i said we need to haul these old photos out ,
i meant me , not you .
you &apos;re going to have to let me do something ...
i &apos;m going nuts in this house .
when are you going back to work ?
i ... we &apos;re not sure .
just as soon as i &apos;m cleared , i guess .
the only thing you have to do is walk down the aisle .
we &apos;re not even doing that , so come on !
you know what i mean .
you &apos;re not ?
your dads aren &apos;t giving you away ?
no , no . lena &apos;s dad got ordained on the internet
so he going to perform the ceremony , so he &apos;s out ,
and dad hasn &apos;t responded to the invitation .
i mean , come on . two women walking down the aisle ? really ?
who &apos;s waiting at the other end ?
why are we being given away ?
to whom are we being given to ?
it &apos;s kind of silly , don &apos;t you think ?
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s silly , exactly , but ...
yeah , it &apos;s not us , that &apos;s true .
yeah .
oh , brandon ...
no , no , no . no ...
mom , i can do it .
let me do it . let me do it .
i came early to help , let me help .
oh , help me .
see ? i &apos;m not the only one
who gets tense when her mother &apos;s around .
it &apos;s not just her . i mean ,
she &apos;s going to drive me to an early grave .
just not looking forward to the conversation
we have to have with callie this morning .
morning , slug @-@ a @-@ bug .
hi .
hey callie , can we talk to you for a sec ?
sure . what &apos;s up ?
it &apos;s about liam .
yeah .

so , i guess brandon and talya are back on ?
how &apos;d that happen ?
i don &apos;t know . it just did .
that &apos;s too bad .
it &apos;s for the best .
if you say so .
i actually came over to say goodbye .
what do you mean ?
well , since we lost the house , my mom &apos;s been freaking out .
so , she decided that we should go back
and live with my grandparents for a while . in indiana .
are you serious ?
yeah .
yeah , this is not one of my weird attempts at a joke that you never got .
so , my mom left with the u @-@ haul last weekend ,
i &apos;m driving out on sunday with the car .
this sucks .
it kind of does .
i &apos;m really ...
... really going to miss you .
me , too .
i don &apos;t know what to get your moms .
and you want me to go shopping ?
yes . tomorrow night .
ok .
thank you .
hey , i &apos;m going to go talk to callie real quick .
ok . you should ask her if she wants to come with us .
ok , i &apos;ll do that .
you ok ?
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
i have to decide today
if i want to go through with the pretrial .
ok .
your mom said it &apos;s going to come down to my word against his .
those kind of things don &apos;t usually go my way , you know .
i mean , sarah &apos;s safe , right ?
she &apos;s out of the house ... wasn &apos;t that the real goal ?
what you did for sarah is great .
but what about what he did to you ?
don &apos;t you think you deserve some justice ?
i got to get to class .
sorry , i didn &apos;t mean to make you self @-@ conscious .
well , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m not the one who &apos;s bothered by it .
i &apos;m not bothered by it . it &apos;s just ...
it &apos;s a constant reminder , you know ?
i do .
it &apos;s not just what happened , it &apos;s ...
you &apos;ll probably be going back to work soon and it makes me ...
i know .
i can &apos;t stay home forever , love .
i can &apos;t believe you kept this wallpaper .
you picked it out .
in 1982 .
and i was wearing holly hobbie dresses ,
《 纽约时报 》 最畅销图画书 《 嘟嘟和巴豆 》 系列作者
and scrunch socks with high tops .
did you hear about kim and darryl ?
she &apos;s having an affair with her stepson .
ain &apos;t that the craziest thing you ever heard ?
well , this is dead .
speaking of crazy ,
did you know lena &apos;s father is performing the ceremony ?
got ordained online or something ...
church of the three stooges .
can you imagine if they had that kinda thing in our day ?
we wouldn &apos;t have had to go to vegas .
it doesn &apos;t matter who does it ,
it &apos;s going to be a lovely afternoon .
the kids are so excited .
they &apos;re happy you &apos;re coming .
you are coming , aren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m just assuming since it &apos;s your only daughter &apos;s wedding ,
that you will be there , right ?
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m using these words , but sharon ,
you got something to say , then say it .
fine . you need to let go of
whatever &apos;s preventing you from rsvping to your daughter &apos;s wedding .
god , politics , i don &apos;t care .
unless you want to risk losing her forever ,
like we almost did last month might i remind you ,
then you need to get over yourself
and put on a nice shirt
and haul your saggy ass to that wedding on saturday .
演唱者 telekinesis
so , i was thinking ...
do you want to , you know ...
again ?
wait . what ?
i was just wondering if , you know , you wanted to have sex again .
whoa , whoa ... lexi .
i thought we agreed we weren &apos;t going to do this again right now .
we &apos;re not even supposed to be alone in my room like this .
i know , i just want to feel close to you again .
i &apos;m confused . i feel like this is a test ,
or a trick question or something ...
you know what , forget it .
forget i said anything .
i &apos;m going to go . i have homework i need to do .
wait , lexi , come on .
come on yourself , jesus .
so , here &apos;s the truth .
there &apos;s no way this case is ever getting in front of a jury .
the judge is going to throw it out , as sure as i &apos;m sitting here .
there &apos;s no direct evidence .
it &apos;s been , what , almost two years since it happened ?
and it &apos;s just you .
and with your record , everything in your file ...
i mean , i told you when we first arrested him ,
that this was a long shot .
it &apos;s not fair . i &apos;m sorry .
on the other hand ,
if the sex with liam had been consensual ...
that would be a different story .
but it wasn &apos;t . it was not .
if it was consensual , well , based on your age difference ,
that would be statutory rape .
and liam might just go to jail for up to a year .
so , you &apos;re saying that nobody
will believe that he forced me to have sex ,
but they might believe that i did it &apos; cause i wanted to ?
and that liam would go to jail for that ?
yes . that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m saying .
hey mike , thanks .
no , no . you supervise , ok ?
ok . between you , lena and my mother , i &apos;m going to go nuts .
what &apos;s new ?
so , you going to go back to work ?
nope .
what ?
they &apos;re hanging me out to dry , stef .
ana &apos;s saying her boyfriend dropped the gun ,
he had his hands up . you know , in surrender .
that &apos;s not true .
what ?
he didn &apos;t put his hands up , mike . i saw it .
you told i.a. that ...
that i was unconscious or in shock or something .
i didn &apos;t want to contradict you in case
you said something in your statement ...
whoa , hold on , wait .
so , you thought i might be lying ?
he dropped the gun , mike , before you shot him .
you sure ?
mike , listen , you heard gunshots ,
you were amped on adrenaline and i was lying on the ground .
of course you thought that he still had the gun .
but he didn &apos;t .
no , he dropped it .
but he did not have his hands up . you did exactly the right thing .
i &apos;m going to talk to roberts and change my statement today .
absolutely not .
yes .
no , stef .
no , mike ...
they &apos;re going to think you &apos;re lying to cover my ass .
or worse , they &apos;re going to figure out you lied before .
you know what that means ?
they &apos;ll fire you as soon as look at you .
no , you &apos;ve got the family to think about .
look , i might lose my job .
but you do that , you &apos;ll definitely lose yours .
absolutely not .
come on , you &apos;re not supposed to do that .
i &apos;m not letting you do everything , mike .
mind if i ?
so ? how &apos;d it go ?
not great .
well , what happened ?
like they were ever going to believe me .
what ? the a.d.a. said they didn &apos;t believe you ?
no , he said a jury wouldn &apos;t .
well , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s going to work out . you know , somehow .
sometimes , you know ...
no .
no . no .
you do not get to say those things to me .
i &apos;m not you . i don &apos;t live in this magical world
where everything always works out , ok ?
so , stop . stop with the pep @-@ talks
and telling me everything &apos;s going to be ok ,
&apos;cause you know what they want me to do next ?
they want me to lie .
they said that the only way
to get a jury to believe that i &apos;m telling the truth is if i lie .
and how is that ok ?
look who i found ! reverend and mrs. adams .
mom ! daddy !
oh , the ministry looks good on you .
thanks . cost me 29.99 .
oh , yes .
hello , beautiful .
hey , mommy .
oh , you look tired .
it &apos;s good to see you too , mom .
who needs a glass of wine ?
me , please .
me , too .
your mother was , unsurprisingly ,
doing a little backseat driving on the way from the airport .
i was not . i was doing passenger seat driving .
i &apos;m back !
hey , look who &apos;s here !
hello !
good to see you .
what took you so long ?
i thought you were just going to the grocery store ?
well , i decided i &apos;d stop by the mall to see
if i could find myself
something a little special for the wedding on saturday ,
and i think i may have found something for you , too .
for what ?
the ceremony .
i already know what i &apos;m wearing for the ceremony , mom .
don &apos;t just dismiss it before you &apos;ve even seen it , stefanie .
i also stopped by your father &apos;s .
that got sorted out . he will be at the wedding .
that &apos;s great . thanks , mom .
oh , boy . wine , yum .
oh , speaking of the wedding ...
i &apos;m running this show , right ?
and i assume we &apos;re not doing the traditional ,
&quot; in sickness and in health &quot; mumbo jumbo .
no .
so ...
have you ladies written your vows ?
yes .
we &apos;re not doing vows ... are we ?
well , without vows ,
it &apos;s really just a bunch of people standing around
looking at you two for no good reason , isn &apos;t it ?
no , i just ... you have a very good point , reverend .
well , i think you two have too much on your plates ,
and you simply must let sharon and me pitch in .
yes , that would give us something to do .
and you guys could just sit back and relax .
yeah , that &apos;s unlikely to happen .
but if you and sharon would like to
take care of the flowers
and the decorations , that would be great .
great .
great .
演唱者 scattered trees
can &apos;t sleep ?
no .
i can &apos;t stop thinking about tomorrow .
i have no idea what you &apos;re going through , you know .
but i do know a lot about lying .
one lie turns into all these other lies .
and before you know it ,
things are just ...
you know ?
look , whatever you decide ,
you know we &apos;ve got you , right ?
i do .
but i really want you to put that bastard away .
so , at the time of the incident , how old were you ?
just turned 15 .
you had just turned 15 ?
yes .
and how old was mr. olmstead at the time of the incident ?
nineteen .
and how would you describe what happened that night ?
would you say it was consensual ?
i know what you want me to say .
you want me to say ,
&quot; yes , it was consensual . yes , i agreed to it . &quot;
because then you can get liam on a technicality ,
and he &apos;ll get a little bit of punishment for the wrong crime .
and you &apos;ll feel good about that because ,
really , that &apos;s more than i should expect .
i want him to go to jail , believe me . i do .
but , in order to make that happen ,
i would have to give away
the only thing i have left .
the truth .
you know what you did to me . i know what you did to me .
so , i &apos;m not going to lie about it .
no , it was not consensual .
no .
he raped me .
i still feel like we should &apos;ve cancelled
avhing this giant party
when callie just went through all of that .
hey , listen . i checked in with her .
she &apos;s grateful for the distraction , all right ?
she &apos;s such a good kid .
she deserves a lot better than what she got today .
i was so proud of her ,
and so sure the judge was going to see it her way ...
it &apos;s not how it works .
yeah , well , that sucks .
yeah , it does . but she did the right thing .
hopefully , someday , somehow , something good will come out of it .
it was everything i could do to not just stand up and shout ,
&quot; this girl is not her file . &quot;
i can &apos;t imagine how awful that must feel to be
reduced to a few sentences about every mistake you ever made .
that girl just needs a break .
hey . what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
please . girl , is it my brother ?
no .
well , not exactly .
my abuelita in honduras is sick .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s not that .
i mean , i never even met her .
but my parents are talking about
going back to see her .
how can you do that since you &apos;re , you know ...
my dad says he has a way to get us there and back .
don &apos;t tell jesus , ok ?
why not ?
i just ... i don &apos;t want to worry him .
i mean , it &apos;s probably not even going to happen .
promise ?
ok .
i mean , that &apos;s awfully pretty , but it &apos;s just , i don &apos;t know ...
it &apos;s a wedding , it &apos;s a party , it &apos;s a celebration .
it just seems to me like , you know ,
something like that would be a lot more fun .
well , i do like that ,
but i can &apos;t help feeling
that what would make the day really special
is something a little more sophisticated .
sophisticated .
i didn &apos;t mean ...
no , of course you didn &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t realize that
&quot; sophisticated &quot; actually meant &quot; stick up your ass . &quot;
hey , how &apos;s it going ?
just great ...
perfect , terrific .
i think i &apos;ll take a little break .
i think you should have your
wife @-@ to @-@ be talk a little sense into her mother .
dana , perhaps ...
stewart .
sharon , who &apos;s a lovely woman , has ,
and i mean this in the best possible way ,
somewhat questionable taste .
and so we therefore now find
ourselves at an impasse regarding the flowers .
mom , it &apos;s flowers . how bad can it be ?
daisies .
she wants daisies . multi @-@ colored daisies .
so no , honey , it &apos;s not that bad ,
if you don &apos;t mind having a clown wedding .
ok , mom , let &apos;s just take a breath .
there &apos;s no need to be so judgmental .
i &apos;m not being judgmental .
i am trying to give you a beautiful day .
and i appreciate that .
i don &apos;t think that you do .
dana , she didn &apos;t mean ...
well , her gratitude is overwhelming .
calla lilies ? calla lilies ?
what does she think , we &apos;re having a funeral ?
&quot; they &apos;re sophisticated , &quot; she said .
i don &apos;t know what to tell you , mom .
tell me you &apos;ll wear this dress .
oh , we have been through this , mom .
you &apos;re wearing pants .
yes .
really , stefanie , pants ?
yes .
at your wedding ? really ?
mom , it has been decided .
let it go !
fine .
thank you .
you &apos;re so stubborn .
you are just like your father .
ok , why am i stubborn because i
want to wear what i want to wear on my wedding day ?
and you wanted to take care of the flowers , so take care of them .
i don &apos;t care if we have
white calla lilies or day @-@ glo gerber daisies .
i just want this day to be
here so we don &apos;t have to talk about it anymore .
mom ... mother . oh , the hand .
i got the hand . ok .
it &apos;s not just me , right ? they &apos;re crazy .
they &apos;re crazy @-@ making .
no , it &apos;s not just you .
thank you .
no , thank you for not being crazy .
all of this fuss over some stupid wedding !
is there a reason you insist
on referring to it as a &quot; stupid wedding ? &quot;
no , it &apos;s just ...
because ever since you proposed to me ,
you &apos;ve been making cracks about how &quot; dumb &quot; it is ,
and how &quot; silly &quot; these traditions are ,
and you &apos;ve been downright
hostile towards anything as &quot; ridiculous &quot; as
walking down the aisle , or wearing a dress , or even writing vows !
don &apos;t do me any favors .
if you don &apos;t want to get married , let &apos;s just not .
let &apos;s just not get married .
thank god .
i thought it was your mother .
no , it &apos;s just me .
come on in .
have a seat . you want a sandwich ?
no , no . i &apos;m good .
mm . so , why the drop by ?
i already told your mother i was coming tomorrow .
yeah , i know about that .
i think mom forced your hand on that and that &apos;s not what i ...
well , don &apos;t blame your mother . she can &apos;t help herself .
i &apos;ve been really embarrassed about this wedding .
i haven &apos;t been able to enjoy one single solitary second of it .
this voice in my head keeps telling me
it &apos;s not right what we &apos;re doing .
two women standing up in front of friends and family
promising to love each other forever . that &apos;s wrong .
how screwed up is that ?
i &apos;m embarrassed by my own wedding ? how is that even possible ?
i love lena and my ...
family , more than i have loved anything ever in my life .
how can i possibly be even the slightest bit uncomfortable
putting that out in the world to see ?
and i realized that voice ,
that voice it &apos;s not mine . it &apos;s yours , dad .
it &apos;s yours , and i &apos;m done .
i &apos;m done listening to it .
and i don &apos;t want that voice at my wedding ,
dad . i don &apos;t want it there .
and i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t want you there .
there shouldn &apos;t be anyone there
who is not 100 percent happy to be there .
so , if you can &apos;t get behind this wedding
and i mean really , really behind it , dad ...
... then i don &apos;t think you should come and that &apos;s ...
we missed you at dinner .
yeah , i had some stuff i needed to take care of for the wedding .
i &apos;m sorry i snapped at you , mom .
and i know i didn &apos;t turn out to be the daughter you dreamed of ,
but i can &apos;t wear a dress just because you want me to .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;d even say that .
i got caught up in the hullabaloo .
i don &apos;t care if you wear a bikini ,
or overalls , or a flak jacket , really .
but you &apos;re right about one thing ,
you &apos;re not the daughter i dreamed of .
you &apos;re better .
of course i want to marry you .
i &apos;d be crazy not to .
are we sure about this ?
then i want to tell them . today .
i don &apos;t want them to come to the wedding not knowing .
so , we &apos;ve already spoken with brandon and the twins about this ,
but there &apos;s something we &apos;d like to ask you guys .
we would like to know how you would feel about
making this a more permanent arrangement ?
you mean , like adopt us ?
we think you deserve a home ,
and we &apos;d like it to be ours .
are you guys ok with this ?
there &apos;s enough to go around .
演唱者 the young romans
so , is that a yes ?
yeah .
yes ?
yes !
yes , they said yes !
hey , can i talk to you a sec ?
sure , what &apos;s up ?
you better open that or people will think we &apos;re having sex .
which , you know , we &apos;re not . so ...
so , why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
about honduras , dummy .
i &apos;m going to kill your sister .
i didn &apos;t want to worry you if it didn &apos;t happen ,
but it looks like we &apos;re going .
my grandma &apos;s getting worse .
i can &apos;t promise that i won &apos;t be worried .
but i &apos;ll be waiting here till you get back .
you &apos;re not going to forget about me ?
i can never forget about you .
i wanted to thank you .
for what ? you were kind of yelling at me last time we were alone .
yeah , i know ...
i wanted to thank you for believing in me
when i didn &apos;t believe in myself .
any time .
you know , i might not have gotten the outcome i wanted .
with the trial , i might not have gotten the justice i deserve ,
but i know what i deserve now . so ...
