We doctors take pride in the fact
that we can basically sleep standing up
anytime, anywhere.
Jackson.
Stop. Stop!
Hey, hey, Jackson.
Aah! What?
Stop. Stop. I'm sorry, but you need to take something.
Where's Charles? Charles. Where's charles?
Hey. Hey. Hey, stop.
It's Lexie. Wake up.
Time for work?
Yeah, just about.
But it's a false pride, because the truth is...
after about 20 hours without sleep...
you might as well just come to work drunk...
doctor or not.
So it's no wonder that fatal medical errors
increase at night...
when we doctors are...
proudly...
sleeping on our feet.
Recently...
our communal pride has been shattered,
and our egos have been wounded by new laws...
Hey.
That require that we sleep all day
before we work all night.
Oh! Dr. Shepherd.
There's French toast and coffee if you want breakfast.
It's 6.00 p.m.
Right. Um, bacon for your dinner?
Thank you, no.
We're not happy about it.
But as someone who may one day need medical care...
you really should be.
It's <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> out there.
I'm still sleeping.
A whole day happened while you were sleeping.
Let's see. I did three aneurysm surgeries.
I consulted on a massive spinal tumor.
That was neat. Got the Phillips Grant.
And oh, by the way,
the, uh, soup of the day in the cafeteria
was potato leek soup.
You got the grant?
Yeah, I got the grant.
You got the Alzheimer's grant?
Yeah, I got the Alzheimer's grant.
Mark is putting together a little celebration at Joe's.
But I would much rather celebrate here with you.
I am late for work. Gotta love the night shift.
Proud of you.
Thank you.
Nice face.
Well, at least I can do surgery. How's that hand?
Ah, it'd be better if you hadn't run your face into it.
So he beats the hell out of you,
and now you're laughing about it?
Ah, some of us can move on.
You're sitting on my coat.
And some of us can't.
Did you just yawn? Was that a yawn?
Don't tell us that you're tired after
getting to sleep all day.
It's not as easy as it sounds.
Not easy? Not e--
When I was a resident, I actually worked for a living.
I did every other night call for five years.
There were days that I didn't go home for 72 hours.
I loved it.
As you trudged through the snow,
while you whittled your own scalpels.
Sorry. I didn't quite catch that, Karev.
Uh, Karev, I need you to follow up on my post-ops.
And here. Take this research.
Divide out all the fistula cases.
Avery and little Grey, Hunt is wag for you in the pit.
All right.
Try not to screw up our patients.
Good night and good luck.
Gonna be over at the bar. Try not to need us.
Dr. Grey? Shepherd's wife?
You're with me tonight.
Yes.
Good. I heard you're good.
Listen, I'm late for dinner,
so, um, I made a list of my patients, their protocols.
Basically, everybody's stable. Just try and keep 'em that way.
And if I need to get in touch with you, sir?
You won't...
'cause you're good.
Nice to meet you.
Everybody else is stable. Watch I.C.U. Bed 12.
He may need to be intubated,
and call me if there are any major traumas.
Avery.
How you feeling?
What, my hand? It's fine. Just a little bruised.
No, I'm not talking about your hand.
Trauma demands a cool head.
If you're not up to this, then--
No, I'm good.
Thanks. Karev and I are cool.
That's, uh... over,
out of my system.
You don't have to prove anything here.
If you need a couple of shifts off--
I said I'm good, sir.
All right.
I'm... I'm not asking you to talk to me.
I'm telling you...
talk to someone.
You got me?
Have a good night, sir.
Hey, there you are.
There's the man of the hour. Congratulations.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you. Mwah.
First round is on me.
Um, guys.
There.
Yeah. No, try again.
You need to tilt the glass like I said.
Tilt.
I'm tilting it. Okay, I know.
I know. I'm telling you to tilt the glass.
Just let me try again, okay?
All right.
Why are you behind the bar?
Uh, Owen told me to get a job, so I'm working.
What's everyone drinking?
She sat on the sofa
for three days straight watching infomercials
and eating cereal out of the box, so yeah, yeah,
I-I told her to get a job.
But you didn't specify what kind.
Well, I thought she'd go to a lab or the morgue.
I didn't expect this.
Well, tell her you changed your mind.
Tell her she can be a housewife for all you care.
I think that
the only thing she'd be worse at than bartending is housewifing.
What's so bad about bartending? She's not dancing on a pole.
You know, I give this one night.
I mean, Cristina Yang of Beverly Hills--
she does not enjoy serving people.
All right! I call this the early onset Alzheimer's
because you won't remember anything after you drink it.
To Shepherd and his genius brain crap.
To Shepherd.
Thank you.
Oh, my god. This is strong.
Yeah, I'm gonna need a Scotch.
Yeah, make it two.
Babies.
Early onset Alzheimer's--
You don't think that's a little distasteful?
I think it's delicious.
Cristina...
You want a beer?
No, no, I'm on call. I want to talk.
You know, a bachelor party just came in.
Uh, uh, we'll talk later.
All right!
Yes. Is someone getting married? Who's getting married?
He said any major traumas.
We are not calling Hunt.
We don't even know what this is yet.
E.R.'s swamped.
We had to split Trauma 3 and put 'em both in there.
Did you call Dr. Hunt?
We are not calling Hunt.
All right. On my count. Ready? One, two, three.
Reilly, you okay?
Lucas, it hurts.
It hurts really bad.
You'll be okay, Ri, all right?
We'll be okay.
What do we got?
Car versus train. 2 brothers, 17 and 15,
tried to outrun the Coast Starlight to Portland.
The train won.
I know. It was stupid. It was so stupid.
I'll never do it again.
Driver was inside the car. The other was thrown out.
No seat belt.
Dr. Avery, come take a look at this.
Call Hunt.
Mrs. Mcneil, I'm Dr. Grey.
I'll be taking over for Dr. Stark tonight.
Drew's in a lot of pain.
Okay, well, that's not unusual for this type of chest surgery.
Abdominal pain is not normal after pectus excavatum surgery,
and it's been going on for two hours.
I'm a nurse in Seattle Pres..
It's okay, Drew, honey. Mommy's right here.
His abdomen does seem a little tender.
I'm concerned about his vitals.
And I know my son. He's not a complainer.
Something is wrong. Can you please call Dr. Stark?
I will. I'll call him right away.
What, you're back already?
That date wasn't even, like, what, an hour?
I need a drink.
Ooh, careful. Ooh - You --
Hey, hey! That was mine. Now you have
to order me another one.
Oh, god. That's disgusting.
Right. Okay, so get this --
his very first question --
"So what's your favorite food"?
What'd you say?
French, but that's not the point.
Why would he ask me what my favorite food was?
Like he read that
that's some good icebreaker from some internet handbook
that was handed out at the loser fair? Ugh!
This is why you don't meet people on the Internet.
You're married! You don't get to have an opinion
about my pathetic forays into Internet dating.
You do need a drink.
Thank you.
Go to Africa.
What?
Arizona's an idiot.
And she's a fool, and you need to go there
and tell her that I told you to say
that dating...is evil,
and that what the two of you have is rare,
and -- and that she's an idiot. Get on an airplane
and go to Africa, and thank god
that you never have to go on a first date again.
Yeah, I'm not going to Africa.
Well, then you're just as big an idiot as she is.
Torres is a grown woman.
You can't make her do something she doesn't want to do.
Okay, again, Mr. Perfect Married Guy,
you don't get to open your mouth,
'cause wh
Get ready. Get ready.
One, two...
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Who's first?! Oh, whoo!
What the hell did I miss?
Joe, I need more beer!
You guys superglued yourselves together... on purpose?
Apparently my son and girlfriend's love is so great,
they can't hear you.
Yes, they superglued their arms and hands together on purpose.
Uh, why -- why would they --
We're moving to Wisconsin tomorrow.
No, you're moving, Dad.
I'm staying here with Lauren.
No, you're not. You're going to Wisconsin
with me and your mom and the dog and the cat.
No, not without Lauren.
I'm not.
Nobody can tear us apart, Mr. Nystrom.
I know that, Lauren, but the doctor here
is still gonna give it a try.
I wish we could glue our lips together forever.
Me, too.
I-I will -- I will figure something out.
Thank you.
Have you ever had the tiramisu at Gino's Trattoria?
Excuse me?
Tiramisu, Gino's Trattoria,
Uh, ladyfingers soaked in rum?
No, I haven't.
Neither have I,
because you felt the need to drag me away from my dinner
to examine a kid with gas.
Gas? I thought...
Oh, when I called you,
he was in a lot of pain and his vitals were borderline.
They're better now
because I gave him a liter bolus
of IV fluids at 20 cc's per kilo.
But his pain --
Yet what you should've given him was an antiflatulent.
Abdominal pain after chest wall surgery
in a patient on narcotic painkillers
is gas or constipation
until proven otherwise.
But, Dr. Stark, what if his pain is --
Tiramisu.
Avery, what do you have?
Large gaping wound to the abdomen.
Looks like something sliced right through him.
Debris inside. We need to get in there.
Book an OR.
Right away.
Reilly? Reilly, talk to me.
Reilly can't talk right now, okay, buddy?
He has got a tube in his throat to help him breathe.
Reilly, I'm right here, all right?
Put more pressure on that. Lean in there.
Pack it. Pack it.
We were gonna be late, so I ran it.
Funny, right?
We didn't want to get in trouble with Mom.
So I go back to school.
I'm picking him up after band practice.
We're halfway home, he forgets his stupid saxophone.
200.
Clear.
He forgets everything!
300.
Everything!
Everything!
Clear.
Continue compressions.
Push one of EPI and one of atropine.
I know it was stupid.
The guardrail had just come down
and I thought we could make it.
It's my fault. Please.
Please. He -- he's my little brother.
He's -- he's little.
They're working on him, okay?
I just need you to take it easy.
All right? Take it easy.
He's gonna be all right, right?
Time of death, 20:48
Dr. Hunt, we need to intubate him and get him to the OR now.
Another scotch?
Yeah.
On the house!
If every drink is on the house,
then eventually, there'll be no house.
Right. Uh, $6.
It's actually $8.
You having fun?
I am.
Good. That's good.
Keep it.
Thank you.
Hey, here she comes with our shots!
His pain is getting worse.
His color looks bad. His vitals haven't stabilized.
I've seen gas, Dr. Grey. This isn't gas.
We have to give the medicine a little time to work.
We gave it time to work. It didn't work...
which means this is not gas.
I've worked the night shift. I know what goes on.
I've lived through horror stories
of patients falling through the cracks
because residents are running around half asleep,
and their attendings are nowhere to be found.
I will not let that happen to my son.
I won't either.
I promise. And I agree that it's not gas.
So let's run some tests and find out what's going on.
Okay?
Thank you.
It's gonna be okay.
Okay, here you go, you guys.
To the groom!
To the groom!
It's rude to ditch out on your own party, you know?
Yang is bartending. Do you know how disturbing that is?
It's a phase. She's gonna be fine.
Besides, you won one of the most prestigious grants out there.
This night's about you not Yang.
...bad idea. That's a good idea.
Suit yourself.
One, two, three.
Groom!
Groom!
How are we letting this happen?
I mean, seriously, how are we just okay with it?
Oh, I'm not okay. I'm jealous.
Cristina gets to live out the 20s we never got to
'cause we were stuck in med school.
Watch, ten years from now, we'll all have a midlife crisis
and end up doing the same thing.
Except we'll be in our 40s and won't look as cute.
How many of those have you had?
Hey, my son is with his father.
I am 24 hours child-free.
If Christina Yang can tend bar 'cause she wants to,
then I can drink 'cause I want to.
Has she mentioned me?
What?
I know she writes to you,
so I'm asking you if she's mentioned me.
Well, you know, she's been very, um...
she's, uh, she just sort of dove right into the medicine,
and she's been--she's been busy and just, uh...
Does that help at all?
I can't believe this. I honest--
I can't believe that I am here again.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You're not doing this.
You're not going down this rabbit hole.
I have to start all over.
All over. I don't even know how to do that.
I do.
You might need a little sexual palate cleanser.
A palate cleanser?
Are you serious?
What? It works.
Sexual sorbet?
I love it!
I like it.
You see that redhead back there?
She's been eyeing you all night.
Really?
Okay. Yeah. Okay.
Thank you, Mark.
All right. I'm gonna, um,
I'm gonna go for it.
Oh, no. Oh, oh.
Wish me luck.
All right, liver hemorrhage is under control.
Let's move on.
Oh, there's another one.
Nope, two.
What is that?
Part of the steering column, maybe.
Might have shattered inside the abdomen.
There's an infrarenal hematoma.
All right. We should expose the retroperitoneum.
Good idea.
I'll get the aorta below the mesocolon.
Slow down, Avery.
We need proximal control first.
You keep looking for this kid's dashboard,
And I'll take care of that.
Can I get some more light in here, please?
Dr. Hunt?
His parents are here.
They're asking for an update.
Avery.
I'm staying.
I'd--I'd--I'd like to stay.
Grey, tell them where we're at.
Okay.
What are you doing in the attendings' lounge?
You could get in trouble.
Pizza?
I have stupid teenage patients
who superglued themselves together
so their parents can't tear them apart.
Mm. That sounds romantic.
Yeah. More like moronic.
I have no idea how to get them apart
without taking off half their skin.
Try acetone.
Try going away.
Meredith, any ideas?
Mm. Acetone?
Thank you.
So what's the deal with Stark?
He's a lazy, a backstabbing weasel. Why?
Because I called him in to examine this patient--
You called him in?
Ha! I wish I coulda seen that.
You don't call Stark.
Well, my kid just had pectus excavatum surgery,
and he was in serious pain.
Yesterday my fundoplication patient was vomiting.
You don't call stark.
Well, this kid's mother is a nurse at Seattle Pres..
Let's play a game. There's one rule.
You don't call stark.
Alex, I'm serious.
Normally I would handle this myself.
But I haven't been on peds in a while,
and you know the complications with these kids.
Did you order blood work and a C.T.?
I'd add an I.D.H.,
a C.R.P. and a sed rate.
I mean, with Stark,
you have to cover all your bases.
So if you do end up calling him,
he has no excuse but to get off his ass and come in.
Thank you.
Well, turns out, she was eyeing my new haircut
and not me.
I gave her the hairdresser's number, though, so...
Well, you tried. You put yourself out there.
That's what counts.
Uh, yeah, no.
Actually, that counts for nothing.
Because I put myself out there every day.
You know, I write online profiles,
and I check the boxes that say
I like hiking.And dogs an--
Is there a box for fistulas?
Because that's what I want--
a guy that can talk fistulas.
I want a guy that can direct me
towards a better scientific understanding
of just why a fistula may occur
in patients that are healthy one minute
and die the next.
Find a man that's interested in fistulas and pancreas,
and you'll find a man
that's not Internet dating.
What's wrong with you?
You didn't call Stark again, did you?
No. I'm not calling him until I get my C.T. results,
and there's only one C.T. tech down there,
and he's really backed up, so...
have I mentioned that I hate the night shift
and I hate Stark?
Hey, Chief. What are you doing here? It's late.
Well, when a screaming mother calls me at home
to tell me my residents are about to kill her son,
time becomes irrelevant, wouldn't you say?
Dr. Grey, are you familiar with Mrs. Mcneil?
She called you? I did not give her your number.
She's a nurse. She worked the system.
But what concerns me is not how she got my number.
It's why she felt the need to call me in the first place.
Now what the hell is going on?!
I have a plan in place.
I'm just waiting for a C.T.,
and the guy is just very backed up down there.
How long have you been waiting?
Two hours.
Get up.
Excuse me?
Get on your feet.
Now I understand you're a little behind schedule.
Yeah. It's just me tonight,
so we're backed up.
Well, why didn't you call the on-call tech?
Well, he wasn't feeling so hot.
I thought I'd cut him a break.
He does the same for me.
Listen... Hawk.
We're in the business of saving lives.
Now I don't care if your friend is lying in a ditch bleeding,
he will come in tonight.
Now get him on the phone. Now.
Give me that.
Hello.
No, this is not your dude. This is Chief Webber.
What do I need? I need you to get yourself into this hospital
in the next five minutes, or you and your dude
can kiss your jobs good-bye!
Now that's how you get things done at night.
I just left Lucas in surgery.
He's critical. It's very touch and go at this point.
But we're still working, and, um,
we'll keep you updated on his condition.
Thank you.
Okay, thanks.
Okay, I'll let you know.
And Reilly?
Our other son--Reilly? How's Reilly?
H-has anyone talked to you?
No. We've been waiting.
Mr. And Mrs. Nash,
I'm, uh, I'm--I'm afraid...
No. No!
I'm sorry to say that...
Please don't say that.
Reilly!
Please don't say that. Please don't say that.
Despite our best efforts to save Reilly's life...
Reilly! Not my baby!
His injuries were too severe...
Not my baby!
And he died in the emergency room.
Oh, my god! My baby! Not my baby!
I'm so sorry.
Oh, please tell me he's gonna live.
The parents didn't even know the brother died.
Not to mention how he's gonna
feel when he finds out.
How do you live with yourself--
Shut up! Just shut up. Please.
Avery.
Sorry. Sorry. I just--
This is a really tricky part right here.
There's something... What is this?
All right, more suction and some laps in here.
Here.
Is that a piece of the turn signal? Come on.
It's right next to the aorta. I can't tell if it's--
If it's kissing it or if it's--it's perfed.
Give me some umbilical tape, and let's pull it
so we can get some control.
Okay, pulling. Pulling.
All right.
Wait, wait, wait. Don't. Don't, don't. Damn it!
Clamp.
Give me the clamp.
Avery, I'll do this.
No, give me the clamp. Give me the clamp.
Here. Take this.
Got it.
I've got the bleeder. I've got the bleeder right here.
Nice work.
Nice work, Avery.
So this won't sting,
but as the skin starts to separate,
you may feel some pain.
I feel nothing but pain right now.
Me, too.
Oh, it's your mother, Lauren.
This is just gonna take a few more minutes, right?
Hopefully.
Is it working? God, I can't look.
Please. If we could just stay together one more day--
Well, you'll definitely be together for another hour,
Because this... is not working.
Yes!
Oh, Dr. Bailey.
Yes.
Dr. Bailey.
Oh. I'm so glad you're here.
I'm not here. You don't see me.
I just need a nap before I go home,
but first I need some food.
Uh, this will just take a second.
I've got these two 15 year olds.
They superglued themselves together.
Uh, they're in love or whatever they think they are.
Anyway, I-I tried, uh, petroleum and acetone
to separate them, but--
Don't separate them.
What?
Young people need love, too, Kepner.
We all need love.
If the world had more love,
we could get rid of wars and fistulas.
Why won't this damn thing take my money?
Dr. Bailey, are you drunk?
Tipsy.
A-a little tipsy.
Right. Um, you know, I'm gonna go ahead
and take care of that for you.
Oh.
Hey, Dr. Altman.
Are you available for a consult?
I'm just waiting on some C.T. Results.
Oh, well, Joe took my keys, so I'm--I'm pretty sure...
I shouldn't be practicing medicine.
Well, what are you doing here then?
Well, I'm killing time until Joe gives me my keys back.
Can't you do that at the bar?
Cristina Yang is bartending,
so, no, I can't. It's just-- it's too depressing.
Cristina's bartending as, what, some kind of joke or--
As some kind of bartender.
Yeah, I know.
That look on your face? That's how my whole body feels,
and not just 'cause Cristina makes
the world's strongest drink,
but because my aspirational couple has broken up,
and they're living on two separate continents,
and 'cause I'm dating men
who still live with their mother.
But they don't admit that on their profiles.
They wait.
They wait--thank you.
They wait until I've spent an hour applying my makeup
and driving crosstown,
and then they tell me that small little detail.
Thank you.
Oh, oh. And my star student,
my most promising resident that I have ever seen,
is mixing Irish Car Bombs for a bachelor party over at Joe's bar.
I'm not even gonna mention
that she's letting the bachelors feel her up at will,
'cause that just adds insult to injury.
Crap. I'm--I'm really drunk.
Pictures are up.
All I'm saying is that that redhead missed out.
If Joe's were a lesbian bar,
You'd have been up to your ears in...
Please don't say vagina.
Well, now I don't have to.
God. I hate being drunk.
You think it's gonna make you feel awesome and happy,
but it just makes you feel tired and gross.
Well, Yang looked like she was having fun tonight.
What, the crazy party girl thing?
That's crap.
Every girl who climbs up on a table
thinks she's the hottest girl in the room, but...
really, she's just dancing alone.
You okay?
Yeah.
I just... I need to sleep.
I need to sleep.
All right.
Drew's got a perforated ulcer.
And Cristina's working at Joe's.
What?
Forget it. It's bleeding,
and it must be from the anti-inflammatories.
Wait. Wh-what about Cristina?
She's a bartender now.
I called Stark in and no answer.
Well, big surprise.
This kid needs surgery.
I know.
Mrs. Mcneil.
This is Alex Karev.
He'll be consulting on your son's case.
The C.T. Scan revealed that your son has a perforated ulcer.
That's what's causing his pain.
So does he need surgery?
Yes.
And we've called Dr. Stark,
and he's on his way.
We can start prepping him immediately.
Thank you. Thank you.
Okay, so hold on. Are we really
gonna call in a whole O.R. team without an attending?
I mean, what if Stark doesn't swer the page?
What if he doesn't come in on time?
What if the kid dies while we're waiting to find out?
Look, I'm taking this kid to the O.R.
whether Stark comes or not. Like the chief said.
this is how you get things done at night.
What if we have to do a truncal vagotomy
or a pyloroplasty?
Have you ever done those on your own?
Not only can I do it. I can do it better than stark.
Are you in or out?
Well, like hell if I'm gonna let you do it without me.
I'm in.
Okay. Is he under?
Is he talking? Yeah. He's under.
No word from Stark yet?
No.
Call him every five minutes until he answers.
And page Dr. Bailey.
Bailey's not on call tonight.
Just keep calling her.
I thought you said you could do this better than Stark.
Shut up. All right.
All right. 10-blade.
Ooh. It's the O.R.
Uh, h-hello.
Uh, Dr. Bailey's phone.
Dr. Bailey's phone.
No, she is, um, she's indisposed... at the moment.
Could you p-page someone else? Thank you.
Okay, good. That's good. Now give me my phone.
I need to call Ben.
Who's Ben?
My ex. I dumped him,
which I now realize was a big mistake,
so I want to call him.
I want to call him and tell him I have needs,
'cause he understood how to take care of my needs
in a way my husband did not.
I want to tell him that. Ha! So give me my phone.
Are--are--are you sure about that?
Give me--
'cause, you know, uh,
drunk dialing never really ends well.
I...
You are a virgin.
Word really does travel around here.
I'm Bailey. I know everything.
Kep--come here, Kepner.
Come. Closer.
Closer.
Alex Karev is not the boy
you want to take your maiden voyage with.
Oh, god.
Oh, god. Yes, I know.
I am aware.
You don't need to tell me.
You take your maiden voyage..
with a nice boy, a kind boy,
a boy who loves you,
a boy that you love so much,
you wanna superglue yourself to him.
You wait. You hear me?
Keep your... knees together.
'cause believe me,
even though you haven't met your Ben yet...
you will meet your Ben.
Not my Ben,
but your own Ben...
who might or might not be called Ben.
Use soap and warm water.
On... my maiden voyage?
On the superglue.
Oh, yeah.
Use soap, water, and put a little acetone in.
It works like a charm.
Okay. Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
Salt! Salt! Come on. Here we go.
You want some more water?
Come on. You got it.
You know, you could fire her for drinking on the job.
Are you kidding me? I did that three hours ago.
Take her home.
Can't. Not until she wants to go.
Why not?
Because she's got a lot of people telling her
what to do, and she doesn't need to hear it from me.
No, back up.
10-yard penalty!
So what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna sit here and drink water,
make sure she doesn't leave with anybody.
Really? That--that's your whole plan?
Well, if she's gonna act like a stripper...
I'm gonna act like a bouncer.
Oh, god.
Dictate the op notes and monitor his A.B.Gs
I'm gonna rack out.
I gotta be back here in-- god--two hours.
I got it. Go.
All right.
Good work, Avery.
Go talk to the parents.
Give them... the good news, okay?
Okay.
You can, um, you can talk to me, you know,
If you want to talk.
About what?
I hear you every night.
You know, I-I'm just saying, I had sleep problems,
and they turned out to be real problems.
Yeah. Well, I don't have any problems.
That kid was practically dead when he got here,
and I pulled half of his car out of him,
so he lived.
He's gonna live to be stupid another day because of me.
Those parents aren't gonna lose everything because of me.
I call that a pretty great night.
So what is your problem?
Any word from Stark?
No.
Here's the perf. Anterior duodenum.
Well, we could do a Graham patch.
Excellent suggestion, fellow surgeon.
2-0 silk, please, Boki.
Can you believe we called an entire O.R.team
and they came? Amazing.
We've got balls. Clamp.
You've got balls. I've got cojones.
You know those are balls, right?
I was just thirsty. I didn't wake you, did I?
Oh, no.
No, I was, um... awake.
Water?
I want, um...
Sorbet.
Sweet tooth?
I think I have some cookies around here somewhere.
Mark.
Really?
Really.
Okay. I told them about the surgery
and his recovery process.
Do you think I should mention his high chance for infection?
I don't know.
I don't want to worry them any more than I have to.
No, just... tell them he's gonna feel pretty awful...
that he lived and his brother died...
that every time he feels glad to be alive...
he'll hate himself for it.
Just tell them to look out for that.
He won't want to talk about it,
but...
he'll be glad they know.
All right.
All right.
Under the cover of darkness...
people do things they'd never do under the harsh glare of day...
Yeah. Nice.
It's not as bad as it looks.
It looks pretty bad.
Yeah.
Hey, thank you for calling.
I appreciate you staying, Shepherd.
Good night.
Cristina.
Oh, my god. It's my boyfriend.
Husband. I'm your husband.
Right.
Sorry, dude. She's all yours.
Come on.
Okay. Come. Come on.
All right.
Good night.
Oh, good!
You're awake.
Indoor voice, please.
Of course.
Um, you know...
I really appreciate you opening up to me.
I mean, you always have that, like,
super-serious Dr. Bailey face on.
I coul't even tell if you liked me,
But now, I mean, well, I-I don't know if I'd say
that we're friends exactly, but, I mean, sort of.
I mean, don't you think?
Dr. Kepner.
Yeah.
This... never happened.
This... never...happened.
Got it?
Mm-hmm.
Say the words. This...
Never happened.
Never happened.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Decisions feel wiser...
People feel bolder.
What can Stark do? I mean, we had to operate.
He can yell. He will yell.
It doesn't matter.
You know, the kid's in good shape, the mom's happy.
We did what we were trained to do.
Remember the first day?
The chief said only two of us would make it.
I thought it would be me and Cristina.
How are we the last two standing?
I am gonna make your lives a living hell.
And you know what? I'm gonna enjoy it.
You lied to my patients. You hijacked an O.R.
You preformed a surgery
that you had no possible business performing,
and for the life of me,
I-I-I don't know what you were thinking.
Medicine has a hierarchy for a reason.
If there had been a complication,
you know whose ass would've been on the line here?
Mine! Not yours. Mine!
You doctors in this residency,
you think you can do whatever you want, whenever you want.
I've got some news for you. I am the attending!
You are the resident...
But when the sun rises...
you have to take responsibility...
for what you did in the dark...
I had to use soap and water.
What?
The acetone didn't work on the superglue
till I mixed it with soap and water.
I could use a little soap and water right now.
I feel disgusting.
I can smell you from up here.
Dibs on the shower.
I want a beer. Who's up for a beer?
Where are you gonna get a beer at 6:00 a.M.?
At home.
And face yourself under the cold, harsh...
light of day.
Water?
Oh, no.
Good morning.
