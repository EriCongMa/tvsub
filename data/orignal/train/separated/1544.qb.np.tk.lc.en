there is my favorite girl !
i &apos;m so excited about our spa weekend !
oh , me too .
if you think of it while you &apos;re there ,
i &apos;m dangerously low on sunscreen powder .
powder ?
you know , you won &apos;t be smirking 10 years from now
when your face looks like an old apple .
i just got my first perk as c.e.o. of pritchett &apos;s closets .
i finished a big job for a spa ,
and as a thank @-@ you ,
they sent me a free weekend for two .
phil &apos;s too ticklish for massages , though .
but i am not !
i heard it &apos;s the place where all the stars go
to get hot mud poured into their faces .
i just can &apos;t wait to see this one without makeup .
you do , it will be the last thing that you will ever see .
i remember my first big perk for a job well @-@ done .
i had upgraded some closets for guy who created &quot; alf . &quot;
and six weeks later , i &apos;m watching the show .
there &apos;s alf sassing this handsome mailman
named jay pritchett .
i still got it on betamax .
i remember . you showed it to me on our first date .
jay , you ready to watch the , uh , fight together ?
yep .
just two of us .
i had the perfect night planned --
alone , pay @-@ per @-@ view boxing --
the pride of ireland versus a cuban sensation .
in the ring and in my bloodstream .
then gloria and mitchell got involved .
jay , cam is gonna watch the fight , too .
why don &apos;t you two watch it together ?
oh , good , because cam was just gonna watch from a bar by himself .
i love it . it &apos;s gonna be like you have a date !
i don &apos;t know what it is , but jay gets uncomfortable
when it &apos;s just the two of us .
and then i get uncomfortable ,
and i feel like i have to say something .
perfect .
today &apos;s hitler &apos;s birthday .
mitchell , we &apos;re going !
where is phil ? the theater &apos;s gonna be packed .
honey , your nerd friend is waiting .
who dare invoke my name ?
that &apos;s my cue .
it is i , your destroyer !
lily , you sure you don &apos;t want to go to the movies with us ?
last chance .
what is it about again ?
the defenders of infinity are heroes
from several different time streams
that make their way into the future without --
um , it &apos;s not really the future
since the streams have always coexisted .
don &apos;t do that . don &apos;t treat me like i &apos;m a lobotomorph .
lily , you don &apos;t want to go .
you &apos;ll be the only girl in the theater .
all right , you guys should head out .
we would love to .
oh , and don &apos;t worry .
lily &apos;s babysitters have a big night planned --
puzzles , ping @-@ pong , board games .
are we still in that &quot; let manny win or he cries &quot; phase ?
no .
we should get going . are we taking separate time streams ?
sure , if we want to get there yesterday .
ah , there &apos;s something so relaxing about a bowl of green apples .
i already forgot all my problems .
did you hear that ?
what ?
exactly .
we used whisperquiet gliders in all the drawers .
oh , really cuts down on c.n.
it &apos;s industry jargon for &quot; closet noise . &quot;
does that technology work on people , too ?
you &apos;re right . i promise -- no more shop talk .
what is this ?
our smoke alarm went off at home .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s nothing ,
but i &apos;m still gonna call luke just in case .
and it &apos;s straight to voicemail .
hello , manny . we saw that the smoke alarm went off .
are you okay ?
oh , god . luke &apos;s outgoing message
is a long and vaguely sexist rap .
okay , papi . stay perfect !
everything is okay .
they were baking cookies and they burned a batch .
all right .
except our oven isn &apos;t working .
manny would never lie . you know what ?
i am gonna call for a russian masseuse .
their hands are very strong from wringing laundry .
think about it .
they were very eager to get us out of the house .
they &apos;re up to something .
you are too suspicious .
and you are too trusting !
luke &apos;s already been arrested this year .
a few weeks ago , we caught him with beer .
even that &apos;s a better rap .
i &apos;m hearing a lot of luke &apos;s name and none of manny .
you don &apos;t think manny &apos;s up to the same things
when you &apos;re not paying attention ?
you &apos;re crazy . manny hates beer .
a fruity beaujolais then .
you can do whatever you want .
i &apos;m gonna go check on my kid .
i hate how good those gliders are !
i am so excited . i feel like a teenager .
me too . although , as torf the ancient ,
i have seen everything from the great star explosion
to the seven moon alliance .
claire was right . no girls .
phil ?
james !
what &apos;s up ?
i sold this cool cat a house in the hills last year .
since then , his bluegrass band has really taken off .
it &apos;s so crazy . we started doing it ironically ,
and before we knew it , we were actually doing it for real .
that happened to me in the &apos; 90s
with saying , &quot; exsqueeze me . &quot;
well , i assume from your torf the ancient costume ,
and your pale slave getup ...
not a costume .
hat you guys are here to see &quot; defenders of infinity . &quot;
oh , yeah !
oh , it is so incredible !
really ?
yeah .
hey , if you really want to be blown away ,
i &apos;ve got two special gummy bears you can have .
just one for each of us ?
believe me . one is all you need .
i guess we can get more at the concession stand .
no , they don &apos;t sell gummy bears like these here .
you get extra cool ones from europe or something .
guys , how are you not getting this ? it &apos;s pot .
i don &apos;t know why , but i &apos;ve never tried marijuana .
no . no , me neither .
th @-@ there was always something stopping me --
needing to take care of lily ,
the figure @-@ skating honor code ,
not wanting to accidentally tell everyone in high school i was gay .
people never offered it to me , which is weird
because in college , i was kind of a big man on campus .
i founded a major organization --
the national association of responsible cheerleaders .
uh , narcs .
yeah .
here . they take 45 minutes to hit ,
so take them now ,
and you &apos;ll be good to go when the movie starts .
okay .
um , you know , if -- if we ever were gonna try this ,
tonight &apos;s kind of the perfect opportunity .
i guess you &apos;re right .
no kids . i &apos;m wearing velcro sneakers .
should we ?
i &apos;ve always wanted to know what it would be like .
plus , i went to the gym today .
i deserve a sweet .
let &apos;s do it .
okay .
i &apos;m shaking . thank you .
cheers .
cheersies .
chew smaller .
&apos;sup ?
oh , my god .
i cannot believe we &apos;re doing this . this is so exciting .
oh , god . i knew this was a horrible mistake .
i just got an alert . our smoke alarm when off !
it &apos;s not coming up .
okay , okay .
relax . i &apos;m gonna -- i &apos;m gonna call luke ,
find out what &apos;s up .
yeah .
voicemail .
this rap &apos;s hilarious , though .
call claire .
she &apos;s not home .
we &apos;re gonna have to check this out .
no , come on . those alerts are always nothing .
plus ... our crime .
listen , we have assigned seats
and 45 minutes till this kicks in .
that gives us plenty of time to uber home ,
make sure everything &apos;s fine ,
touch up my veins , and get back .
i &apos;ll set an alarm so we know exactly when it hits .
no , you &apos;re right . lily &apos;s there . yes , yes . let &apos;s go .
plus , we &apos;re not gonna want to deal with this
when we &apos;re high and paranoid .
oh , god .
do you think the paranoia will be bad ?
so , how &apos;s the closet business ?
i retired two months ago .
right . right .
uh , getting our carpets cleaned next month .
oh , come on . that &apos;s ridiculous .
hernandez has this fight in the bag .
yeah , it &apos;s gonna be such a cakewalk .
he shouldn &apos;t even be getting paid for it .
can you believe these guys ?
no disrespect , but if o &apos;brien &apos;s even halfway sober ,
he takes hernandez apart .
yeah , he &apos;s got a better reach , better jab ,
and i haven &apos;t seen feet that fast since riverdance .
you guys seem pretty confident .
uh , care to make a friendly $ 10 bet ?
we &apos;ll take it . easiest money i ever made .
you &apos;re crazy . o &apos;brien is a mook .
well , hernandez is a palooka .
i &apos;d rather be a palooka than a mook .
well , that &apos;s a lot of talk coming from a couple jabronis .
cam , calm down . we &apos;re just having fun here .
really ? that &apos;s -- that &apos;s the line ?
what happened ?
damn it ! o &apos;brien knocked him out !
already ? we missed the whole thing !
we &apos;re backed up in the kitchen .
sorry , guys . your food &apos;s gonna be a while .
i thought about leaving ,
but i didn &apos;t want to make jay feel bad .
i had a sandwich coming .
i told you . nothing !
a little too much nothing , if you ask me .
what are you guys doing here ?
i forgot my slippers .
doesn &apos;t the hotel have slippers ?
i &apos;ll be asking the questions .
how did you manage to burn chocolate @-@ chip cookies
in an oven that doesn &apos;t work ?
oh , manny meant pancakes .
we &apos;re making chocolate @-@ chip pancakes .
you see ? now , let &apos;s go .
somebody named olga should be salting me like a pretzel !
is everything okay ?
oh , yes . it was just a false alarm .
well , then we should probably get back to the theater .
those pre @-@ movie trivia questions
aren &apos;t gonna answer themselves , are they ?
actually , they do .
wait a minute !
what the hell is going on ...
here , huh ?
i smell cheap beer . someone &apos;s been having a party .
claire , you &apos;re just being crazy .
take a look around ! nothing is going on !
there is no party !
everyone just be cool !
see that story about the one @-@ armed golfer ?
no .
yeah , well , it &apos;s this guy and he &apos;s ...
well , i guess that &apos;s it . he &apos;s -- he &apos;s a one @-@ armed golfer .
how backed up is that kitchen ? !
these guys !
hey , you rascals . get over here .
we &apos;re on our way out .
no ! don &apos;t you want a chance to win your money back ?
it &apos;s 5 bucks each . we &apos;re good .
no ! come on !
it &apos;ll be fun .
dude , you &apos;re hurting my arm .
no , a game of foosball , double or nothing .
i don &apos;t think -- - you &apos;re on ! let &apos;s go !
phil , uh , how long do we have ?
17 minutes .
till the movie , is what we &apos;re talking about .
we &apos;re just two guys seeing a movie .
no one &apos;s leaving here until we get to the bottom of this .
oh , my god . somebody give me a back rub !
manny ! luke ! get in here !
you guys go search the house . find something suspicious .
is this gonna be like loading the dishwasher ?
first i load it , then you reload it ?
wouldn &apos;t it be faster if you actually ...
phil , go !
what &apos;s so important ?
i &apos;m sitting for my portrait .
oh , knock it off . i know you two threw a party .
i don &apos;t &quot; throw &quot; a party , claire .
it &apos;s true . he can &apos;t throw anything .
and if i were hosting an event ,
where did i put the ice sculpture ?
where did i stash the hors d &apos;oeuvres ?
where did i hide the jazz trio ?
good question ,
considering you couldn &apos;t even hide ... the solo .
nice wordplay , mom ,
but that cup &apos;s been there for like three days .
i didn &apos;t want to say anything
&apos;cause i thought it was yours .
yeah . it was bold .
but those kids upstairs weren &apos;t gonna stay quiet forever .
i was one dead phone battery away from a conversation breaking out .
sure , throwing a party was a risk ,
but two hot exchange students just started at our school .
best part is , they don &apos;t understand
just how uncool we are .
yet .
so , we were walking down the hallway
when we stopped by the locker --
ohh , pizza day .
that &apos;s our personal trainer .
he hates it when we eat carbs .
we had a short window .
we needed to impress them fast .
so , we bribed lily with all the soda she could drink
and threw a party .
it was going great until someone set off the alarm
because he just had to smoke his dorky pipe .
dorky ?
yeah , because hugh hefner doesn &apos;t get girls .
i love you , too , mommy .
all clear , party people !
i told her we were baking cookies .
dude , our oven &apos;s broken .
my mom &apos;s definitely gonna get suspicious and check on us .
that means my mom &apos;s coming , too .
i &apos;ll get everyone to leave ,
you get rid of the beer and your idea of a spread .
wait . we &apos;re not giving up yet .
the beer pong tournament just started ,
the girls are laughing at all of our jokes ,
and they think we &apos;re friends with guys like tommy cutahee .
great party , lewis .
thanks , tommy .
from now on , i &apos;m lewis .
we &apos;re going to get caught if we do nothing .
what if we hide everyone long enough
for my mom to check on us and then leave ?
it &apos;s not worth it .
guys , when do we play seven hours in heaven ?
moving the party upstairs , people !
okay . no one &apos;s here .
is that your watch alarm ?
we have to get out of here !
i do not want to be high in front of claire !
wait .
i think i &apos;m feeling something .
oh , no .
what are you feeling ?
nice .
oh , god .
are you feeling anything ?
no .
then why are you leaning like that ?
i &apos;m not leaning .
maybe you &apos;re leaning so it looks like i &apos;m leaning .
oh , yeah . you &apos;re right .
phil , what are you doing ?
still searching !
anything suspicious ?
say nothing .
okay .
phil ?
answer her !
you said &quot; say nothing . &quot;
i mean say the word &quot; nothing . &quot;
word .
nothing !
that was so good .
thanks , man .
okay , phillip . focus .
we have to finish searching this house
before we start acting weird or ...
nothing !
that was so great .
yeah , i learned from the best .
come on , you jerk . get in there , you son of a bitch !
oh , yeah , baby . here we go .
that &apos;s what your sister said last night
when i was banging her .
what ? ! aw , damn it , vic !
cam was banging vic &apos;s sister .
classic !
oh , just hit it already .
that &apos;s what your sister said to cam last night when he was banging her .
did i do it ?
you &apos;re so good !
yes !
manny , manny ... manny .
how did we get here ?
you &apos;re a good kid .
you didn &apos;t have anything to do with this .
you were in the wrong place at the wrong time .
am i right ?
but someone &apos;s going down for this .
you think it &apos;ll be the white kid ?
claire !
what are you doing ?
i am trying to get to the truth .
the only way i &apos;m gonna find out what really happened here
is to get those two clowns to turn on each other .
nothing happened here !
and even if it had ,
manny &apos;s not gonna rat out his best friend !
i think i &apos;m gonna take the deal .
no !
you cave , we don &apos;t stand a chance
with those exchange students .
those girls don &apos;t respect weak , little nerds
afraid of being punished by their mommies .
they &apos;ve lived through wars .
they &apos;re from portugal !
i heard something .
did you hear something ?
no .
am i screaming right now ?
no .
stay cool . we &apos;re almost out of here .
all clear .
let &apos;s just check luke &apos;s room .
then we can tell claire we didn &apos;t find anything .
okay , there &apos;s two ways we can play this .
okay .
okay , if we tell claire about those kids ,
we &apos;re gonna have to stay here and punish manny
and the , uh -- the other one .
that &apos;s no good !
i don &apos;t think we can hide our crime !
well , then what if we don &apos;t tell her ?
does -- does that make us bad parents ?
or are we bad parents ,
because we &apos;re punishing our kids while we are high ?
we &apos;re bad parents either way !
this is a nightmare .
oh , hey , guys .
hey , cupcake !
do i call her &quot; cupcake &quot; ?
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;ll make it normal .
what &apos;s going on , cupcake ?
are you guys okay ?
yeah . yeah , we &apos;re okay . why wouldn &apos;t we be okay ?
cupcake .
i was so drunk , i thought they were stoned .
luke ... luke ... luke .
keeping a secret like this is tough --
eats away at a man &apos;s soul .
mom , i have one question --
why do you hate yourself ?
what ?
you have one night in a spa to be massaged and pampered ,
but you &apos;re here .
why don &apos;t you think you deserve happiness ?
that &apos;s the mystery i &apos;m interested in solving today .
what is that ?
that is the sound of a party , gloria , huh ?
ay , manny !
tomorrow &apos;s gonna be one awkward mother / son mambo class .
next up , i paddle your mother .
dad .
claire !
hey , this is my actual daughter .
you came up a few times tonight .
so has my &quot; wife . &quot;
what are you doing here ?
we ran out of games to bet on at the bar .
claire ... there &apos;s something we have to tell you .
what did we decide to do again ?
we , uh ...
we &apos;re g-- we &apos;re gonna need a minute .
i told you there was nothing going on with the boys .
you &apos;re right .
boys , i apologize .
we can confirm that there &apos;s nothing suspicious anywhere .
sorry about your table , lewis .
i have another party .
oh , i knew it !
i knew these two were up to something .
what do you think about your precious manny now , huh ?
i am sure it was luke &apos;s idea !
but do not give up on him yet .
i know that there is a camp up in the mountains
where you can send bad kids .
no , it was my idea , too .
i &apos;m the one who set off the smoke alarm .
i &apos;m the one who bribed lily with soda .
i &apos;m the one who put a red light bulb in the laundry room
to give it a sexy vibe .
you &apos;ve got to stop thinking of me as your perfect little boy .
honey .
there &apos;s a party upstairs .
party upstairs .
i cannot believe that my baby lied to me .
i cannot believe my baby accepted a bribe .
i &apos;d be more concerned with how natural she is
with that bottle in her hands .
okay .
i shouldn &apos;t trust my kid so much .
i have to be more like claire and not trust anybody .
i didn &apos;t want to be right , but i am .
so here we are .
at least we still have alex .
you guys don &apos;t have any good kids ,
so who &apos;s the bad parent now , huh ?
nobody .
phil , no , don &apos;t .
no , no . i got this .
claire , i know why you &apos;re always worried .
because you don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
it &apos;s called fear of the future ,
or &quot; fof &quot; or &quot; fotf . &quot;
but spoiler alert -- it &apos;s gonna be great .
guys , i have two words for you --
think about time travel .
if you could go forward in time and turn around
and look at this moment , we would say ,
&quot; this is all super chill . &quot;
our kids are good people .
they turn out great .
phil &apos;s right .
really ?
oh , t @-@ then here &apos;s something , too .
when i was younger , i never thought i would be here .
and here i am .
what the hell does that mean ?
oh , god .
look , you got to relax .
they &apos;re going to be fine .
people have a way of surprising you .
yes , you see , we had our own journey tonight --
an unlikely duo thrust together .
not your moment , cam .
oh , right . i &apos;ll send a group e @-@ mail .
honey , don &apos;t worry .
you &apos;re better parents than dede and i ever were ,
and you turned out all right .
thanks , dad .
but what do we do now ?
are we just supposed to let these kids off the hook
because we were as bad as they are ?
no . we &apos;ll be hypocrites .
like all parents !
luke ! manny !
get your asses in here !
also , am i the only one that sees
that these two idiots are high as kites ?
mitchell ?
oh , my god . she is still going .
how much soda did she have ?
you know , when you and mitchell first got together ,
you used to ask me to do a lot of stuff .
i was new to the family , and i --
i really wanted you to like me .
but i always seemed to be too much , too demonstrative ,
too dramatic ... so i stopped .
well , i had fun tonight .
i wouldn &apos;t mind if you still
chased me a little bit sometimes .
oh , jay . get in here .
it &apos;s going too fast .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry . baby steps .
no , the treadmill &apos;s about to launch her through the drywall .
lily .
