okay
i &apos;m moving out , so you &apos;re in charge of paying the rent .
when &apos;s it due ?
on the first . -and that &apos;s every month ?
no , just the months you want to live here .
okay , here &apos;s the phone bill .
oh , my god !
that &apos;s our phone number .
i know i kind of sprung this me @-@ moving @-@ out @-@ on @-@ you thing.why don &apos;t i cover you for a while ?
no way ! joey tribbiani does not take charity ...
anymore .
it &apos;s not charity , joe .
forget it .
thanks , but i &apos;m done taking money from you .
i can take care of myself . what &apos;s next ? come on .
here &apos;s the electric bill .
this is how much we pay for electric ?
well , yeah .
so we &apos;ll do the rest of the bills later , then ?
the one on the last night
will joey have to give up the apartment ?
i offered him money , but he wouldn &apos;t take it .
how much does he need ?
$ 1500 would cover him for a few months ...
but i have to trick him into taking it so i don &apos;t hurt his pride .
why don &apos;t you hire him as an actor ?
you could have him dress up and put on skits whenever you want .
well , that would help the pride thing .
wow , you look great ! do you wanna move in with me tomorrow ?
okay ! okay !
any plans for tonight ?
instead of being sad on my last night with rachel ... we &apos;re going out to celebrate
rachel &apos;s moving in with phoebe .
and also my birthday .
it &apos;s not your birthday .
what a mean thing to say ! i &apos;d never tell you it wasn &apos;t your birthday .
you guys have anything planned for the big last night ?
instead of just hanging out , we figure we &apos;d do nothing .
knicks &apos; season opener tonight .
i thought you &apos;d come and watch it .
i don &apos;t know , ross .
not if you talk about how you gave up basketball to become a paleontologist .
i did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist !
phoebe ..
you &apos;re not dressed yet ?
we &apos;re supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes !
and clearly , not a minute sooner .
you are packed , though , right ? please tell me you &apos;re packed ?
of course i &apos;m packed . monica , relax .
i wanted to ask phoebe what i should wear .
my god , i can &apos;t get a minute of peace .
oh , my god !
monica &apos;s just gonna kill you .
i know.what you &apos;re wearing is fine for that .
rachel , i ...
you &apos;re not packed ! you &apos;re not packed even a little bit !
surprise !
don &apos;t get mad , because this is what happened .
i started packing ,
then i realized , &quot; what am i doing ? &quot; i am lousy at packing , right ?
but you love packing ! so as a gift to you on our last night ....
i &apos;ll be coordinator !
oh , my god , i &apos;m so sorry . i didn &apos;t get you anything .
everybody has to help . phoebe , can you help ?
i have plans .
you have plans with us .
that &apos;s right .
chandler can make boxes , ross can wrap and joey can lift .
tell the guys they have to help out .
my god , thank you !
monica &apos;s gonna make you pack ! she &apos;s got jobs for everyone !
now , it &apos;s too late for me , but save yourselves !
the movers will be here in 11 hours . rachel hasn &apos;t packed .
now , everybody has to help .
chandler .. i have plans with joey .
you said you were doing nothing .
yes , but for the last time .
fine . now , ross ..
i can &apos;t do it .
why not ?
don &apos;t you have ben ?
because i have ben !
it &apos;s almost past his bedtime . where is he ?
he &apos;s at a dinner party .
he &apos;s really coming ? i can see in your apartment .
of course he is . what ?
you think i &apos;d use my son as an excuse ? what kind of father do you think i am ?
all right . sorry .
i gotta go make a fake ben .
here it is.our last pizzas together as roommates .
i wish i knew that . i ordered chinese .
well , that &apos;s okay .
in a way it &apos;s kind of nice . you know ? our last dinner together .
me , bringing the food of my ancestors , you , the food of yours !
i had an idea for what to do on our last night .
what do you say we play a little foosball for money ?
are you crazy ? you haven &apos;t beaten me since my injury @-@ plagued &apos; 97 season .
it &apos;d be easier to give me your money .
yes , it would .
what do you say to $ 50 ?
i say to it : &quot; 50 dollars , you are more than i have . &quot;
if you know that you &apos;ll win , what difference does it make ?
you &apos;re on .
okay , let &apos;s play .
the big game . italy versus ... china , apparently .
look , it &apos;s the rollerblades.oh , god !
you remember when we got these ?
no
i guess you weren &apos;t there .
you guys , we said we were gonna have fun .
come on . hey , remember the time ....
you don &apos;t remember ?
sorry , phoebe . i &apos;m just really sad that i &apos;m leaving .
i &apos;m gonna miss you so much .
this doesn &apos;t have to be so sad , though , you know ?
instead of thinking about how you &apos;ll miss each other ... you should think of the things you &apos;re not gonna miss .
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s anything.come on , there &apos;s gotta be something .
she &apos;s perfect .
i have one .
okay , you can go first .
i guess i &apos;m not gonna miss the fact ... that you &apos;re never allowed to move the phone pen .
that &apos;s a good one . okay , monica , anything ? you know , does rachel move the phone pen ?
sometimes .
always , actually .
there you go . doesn &apos;t everyone feel better ?
not just the phone pen .
i never get my messages.you get your messages .
it doesn &apos;t count if you have to read them off your hand ... after you &apos;ve fallen asleep on the couch .
so you missed a message from who ? chandler ? or your mom ?
or chandler ? or your mom ?
it worked ! no one &apos;s sad !
i win again ! that &apos;s , like , 500 bucks you owe me !
man ! five hundred dollars.that is a lot of electricity , huh ?
i gotta buy some food .
give me a chance to win my money back . sudden death ... one goal , $ 1000 .
you serious ?
yes !
get ready to owe me .
here we go . ready ?
no ... one can beat me !
that &apos;s why only the little fake men are supposed to do the kicking .
hi , ross . see , other people call me !
oh , your brother . score !
what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m here with ben.thought we &apos;d say hi .
put him on .
ben , say hi to aunt monica .
i guess he doesn &apos;t feel like talking right now.he &apos;s smiling , though .
okay , talk to you later .
you know , daddy was gonna be a basketball player .
i think it was better when you guys were sad .
hey , remember the rollerblades ?
you know what else i won &apos;t miss ?
&quot; i &apos;m monica.i wash the toilets 17 times a day ,
even if people are on it ! &quot;
&quot; hi , i &apos;m rachel . is my sweater too tight ?
i &apos;d better wash it and shrink it ! &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m monica . i never get messages from interesting people . &quot;
i call her .
&quot; oh , my god ! i love ross . i hate ross . i love ross . i hate ross ! &quot;
&quot; my god ! i can &apos;t find a boyfriend .
i &apos;ll stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy i find there ! &quot;
you guys , come on , this is the last night !
yeah , you &apos;re right , and so for the last time i would like to ask you :
boo @-@ hoo . get out of my room !
we should get a move on if we want to make those dinner reservations .
still broken ?
it sucks , man .
your last night , and i lose the two most important things :
the foosball table ... and $ 500 .
there are other ways to win back your money . how about blackjack ?
not my game .
you know what ? we can play a new game.it &apos;s fun !
what &apos;s it called ?
cups .
i don &apos;t know how .
i &apos;ll teach you . it &apos;s easy and fun .
all right .
here you go .
i have two queens . what do you have ?
a 2 and a 5 .
you win ! fifty dollars !
really ?
let &apos;s play again .
what have you got ?
4 and a 9.you &apos;re kidding , right ?
no . why ?
that &apos;s a full cup !
damn , i am good at cups !
i &apos;m not talking to her .
you have to take the first step ...
because she &apos;s the one who &apos;s leaving . it &apos;s harder for her .
maybe you &apos;re right.but she made fun of my phone pen !
i know . i took it hard too .
she &apos;s in there right now , crying . i can hear her .
she &apos;s not crying .
she &apos;s holding it in . she &apos;s so brave . go .
i feel bad about what happened .. what are you doing ?
i &apos;m unpacking .
what ?
i &apos;m not moving . is that picture straight ?
it needs to go about 20 blocks to the left .
you &apos;re the one who wants this big change and to move in with chandler !
you should go ! why do i have to leave ?
it &apos;s my apartment !
it &apos;s mine too ! what else you got ?
how about : you &apos;re moving !
this is ridiculous .
we should be packing you !
hey , how you guys doing ?
great . monica &apos;s moving .
i am not !
really ? how come all your stuff is in this box ?
okay , you guys , i think i know what &apos;s going on here !
you guys ? stop !
i know you &apos;re acting mad because it &apos;ll make it easier to leave .
but deep down , you &apos;re really sad . deep , deep down .
no , phoebe , i am mad !
well , deep deep deep down !
i &apos;m just mad .
then keep running .
you win !
what did you have ?
nothing beats ... a three and a six .
that , my friend , is &quot; d cup . &quot;
how much have you won so far ?
700 .
not 700 exactly ?
double it .
in cups , once you get $ 700 , you have to double it .
i didn &apos;t make up the rules .
now , after you receive the doubling bonus , you get one card .
that one card could be worth $ 100 , which brings your total to $ 1500 .
don &apos;t get excited , that won &apos;t happen unless you get the .. no way !
this is the last box of your clothes .
i &apos;m just gonna label it &quot; what were you thinking ? &quot;
i was just gonna go across the hall and write that on chandler .
guys , i don &apos;t wanna make things worse , but ...
i don &apos;t wanna live with rachel anymore .
you &apos;re so mean to each other .
i don &apos;t wanna end up like that with rachel . i still like you .
that &apos;s fine because i &apos;m not moving .
phoebe , you gotta take her .
i said some bad stuff ... but rachel has qualities that make her a good roommate .
like what , monica ?
she has 147,000 pair of boots .
good start , mon .
she lets you borrow them .
and you stretch them out with your big old clown feet .
do you wanna live outside ? because it &apos;s getting cold !
she gets tons of catalogs
and folds down the pages of things i &apos;d like .
what else ?
when i take a shower ... she leaves me notes on the mirror .
i do . i do do that .
that &apos;s nice . i like having things to read in the bathroom .
when i fall asleep on the couch ... she covers me with a blanket .
well , you know , i don &apos;t want you to be cold .
and when i told her i was gonna move in with chandler ... she was really supportive .
you were so great.you made it so easy .
and now you have to leave.and i have to live with a boy !
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
now i can &apos;t wait to live with you !
you know what we should do ? bring monica , and we &apos;ll live together ! we &apos;ll have so much fun !
i think she &apos;s moving in with chandler.oh , that &apos;s right .
you &apos;re still set on that ?
kind of .
oh , my god !
how &apos;s the packing going ?
ben ? he &apos;s fine . he &apos;s right .. oh , my god !
get your head out of your shirt there , son !
yeah , it &apos;s a pumpkin . i &apos;ll come pack .
what &apos;s wrong ?
ross and i were helping pack ... took a little break .
i lost $ 1500 to him in cups !
how did you lose at cups ? the same way you lost !
i started out with the king and the queen . bam ! ross gets a 2 and a 3 .
then i get a jack and a king . boom ! ross gets a 4 and 5 .
even ross was getting the cup card , the d cup ... the sitting @-@ down bonus .
i didn &apos;t even get half a cup ! nothing !
oh , man !
he never played before either.i think beginner &apos;s luck is very important in cups !
let &apos;s play one more hand . one more hand .
no more ! i cannot lose another dime . i &apos;m serious this time .
in fact , look.i wanna give you something .
let me give it to you before i pawn it for cups money .
i want you to have the big , white dog as a thank @-@ you for being such a great roommate .
i can &apos;t take the big white dog . you love it .
it &apos;s &quot; him . &quot; not &quot; it . &quot;
what if i bought it from you ?
then your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price.say $ 1500 ?
wait a second . i see what you &apos;re trying to do here .
you &apos;re trying to give me money again !
when did i try to give you money ? over there with the bills !
you tried to give me charity , i said no , you dropped it .
we had a nice last night together .
we had some fun , we gambled , nobody tried to give anybody any money .
now you start with the charity thing again !
i &apos;m trying to help you out . i wanna make sure that you &apos;re okay .
i will be okay .
you gotta get it out of your head that i can &apos;t take care of myself .
i &apos;m not gonna miss you helping me out with money .
the only thing i &apos;m gonna miss ... is you .
and now the dog .
call me when you get there , okay ?
okay .
i &apos;m really gonna miss you .
i have your key .
here you go .
thanks .
god , this is silly . i &apos;ll see you in a couple of hours .
bye , house .
bye
she really left .
i know .
thank you .
no problem , roomie .
can i ask you a question ?
sure .
what the hell is that dog doing here ?
i invented the game of cups as a way to give joey money .
and now you want that money back ?
exactly .
what kind of idiot do you take me for ?
it &apos;s not a real game . i made it up .
i &apos;m sorry you lost your money . but i won it fair and square .
at a fake game !
if you wanna try to make some of it back ... i &apos;d be glad to play you for it .
but i should warn you.i am very good at cups .
i assume the saucer card came up when you played last .
no
