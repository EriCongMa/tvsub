kammie , kammie , no .
i &apos;m sorry , babe . shrimp @-@ bucks-- that is not legal tender .
what ? !
she means cash , brah .
yeah , i know what she means ,
but these babies are better than cash .
shrimp @-@ bucks are good every day of the week from 2 : 00 to 4 : 00 .
although some restrictions do apply .
2 to 4 . that &apos;s very generous .
it &apos;s a time of day when nobody on the earth eats .
that &apos;s my bet . take it or leave it .
all right , we &apos;re gonna take your confederate money .
here . let &apos;s see your cards .
kawika with a pair of jacks .
hello ?
three of a kind .
kamekona with two pair .
hello ?
excuse me one second .
hey , guys , deal me out , all right ?
amir ? amir ? !
catherine , everything all right ?
i ... i don &apos;t know yet . i don &apos;t know .
damn it . it won &apos;t go through .
steve , we got to go .
amir ?
amir ?
so our vic &apos;s name is bruce paloma .
and according to this parking pass
that hpd pulled out of his glove box ,
he worked at kuakini medical center .
now , the driver of their truck says it looked to him
like he may have been chasing a guy on a motorcycle
when he ran out into the intersection .
if he was chasing somebody ,
why wasn &apos;t he pursuing them in the car ?
well , he could have if the keys were still in the ignition .
instead , they were found way over there .
okay , so maybe it &apos;s just a mugging .
guy on the bike pulls up , sticks up our victim ...
... takes his keys , tosses them
so he can &apos;t follow him in the car .
nope . not a mugging .
i got cash , i got cards .
what about the driver of the truck ?
did he get a description of the guy on the bike ?
no , the only thing he said was that he was on a black sport bike
with a top case on back .
there &apos;s an alert out now .
ran plates on your vic &apos;s car . turns out , it &apos;s not his .
it &apos;s actually registered to makana of life hawai &apos;i .
they &apos;re one of three groups in the state
that recovers organ and tissues for transplant .
we got keys ?
this car was being used to transport an organ .
that guy on the bike must have jacked it .
that &apos;s why bruce paloma went after him .
there was a life at stake .
yeah , and bruce gave his own trying to save it .
what &apos;s going on , cath ?
i need your help , steve .
that call i got earlier--
it was from a man in afghanistan named amir khan .
i take it he &apos;s a friend of yours ?
yeah , he is , and he reached out to me
because his 14 @-@ year @-@ old son najib was kidnapped by the taliban .
now , these guys-- they don &apos;t do k &amp; r ,
which only means one thing .
yeah , the kid was recruited against his will .
or they &apos;re gonna strap an ied to him
and turn him into a suicide bomber .
either way , his life is over .
which is why i &apos;m going over there .
i &apos;m gonna find him ,
and i &apos;m gonna bring him home to his family .
what ?
steve , i know .
i know what you &apos;re gonna say , okay ?
and @-@ and i agree that it sounds crazy ,
but i &apos;m going .
okay , stop .
just stop for a second , okay ?
tell me who exactly are these people to you ?
remember that mission i told you about in &apos; 07 ?
the one that went way sideways ?
the recon surveillance op ?
mm @-@ hmm .
your unit came under fire , you got separated from your group .
yeah .
all right .
here &apos;s the part i didn &apos;t tell you .
after i got separated , i , um ... i found myself in a field ,
and i was badly wounded .
i had a gsw to the leg ,
a broken arm , a broken vertebra .
i had no sat phone , no radio .
i was completely cut off .
and that &apos;s when they found me .
no , no , no , no !
is okay .
we &apos;re not enemy .
they were pashtun .
it &apos;s okay .
and for reasons i didn &apos;t understand at the time ,
amir offered me his help .
and i accepted .
thank you .
a few days later , they saved my life again .
okay , you sure you &apos;ve never played this before ?
go outside . hurry .
what ? what @-@ what is it ?
taliban are coming .
next day , i left the village ,
flagged down a u.s. convoy and made it back to base .
and for their own safety ,
i never mentioned amir or his family to anybody ,
&apos;cause if word would have gotten out what they had done for me ,
the taliban would have killed them .
they risked everything to help me , steve ,
which is why i have to .
i have to go back and help them .
i understand wanting to help .
i really do .
but this-- it &apos;s not the way to do it .
catherine , you got to call the military .
you got to let them handle this .
no , no . steve , come on . i &apos;m telling you .
steve , before they do anything ,
they &apos;re gonna have to verify everything amir said to me ,
which could take days or weeks .
meanwhile , i can be on the ground by dawn .
how can you do that ?
i mean , last i checked , you &apos;re not active duty anymore .
you can &apos;t just hop a flight to kabul .
this is where you come in .
actually , this is where joe white comes in .
i need you to talk to him .
i need him to get me into afghanistan under the radar .
this is crazy , catherine !
steve , listen to me . this is not up for discussion , okay ?
this is happening .
whether you like it or not , this is happening .
now , either you can go talk to
joe white and help me ,
or i can make my own arrangements .
i &apos;ll call joe .
thank you .
final boarding call for flight 421 .
all passengers , please proceed to gate 34 @-@ a.
hey . stubborn !
that &apos;s right , you .
hold that flight .
well , you didn &apos;t think i was gonna let you go alone , did you ?
i got the window .
hey , what the ...
leon chase , right ?
five @-@ 0 .
let &apos;s talk .
you boys are way off .
i may have done some dumb @-@ ass things in my life ,
but ripping off a human liver isn &apos;t on the list .
really ? well , that &apos;s funny , &apos; cause we just spoke
to a old business associate of yours up in halawa ,
and he said that you are the only organ trafficker left on oahu .
so we &apos;re gonna ask you again--
where &apos;s the liver ?
and i &apos;m gonna tell you again-- i don &apos;t know .
i was home alone last night .
okay , well , let &apos;s put aside what you don &apos;t have ,
which is an alibi--
now let &apos;s talk about what you do have--
a kawasaki z @-@ 1000,
which is a high @-@ performance sports bike , right ?
what does that matter ?
well , that matters because the person who stole the liver
fled the scene on a sport bike .
but i suppose that &apos;s just coincidence , too , yeah ?
it &apos;s kono .
kono , what do you got ?
i just got off the phone with hpd .
they swung by leon &apos;s house to check the tires on his bike .
unfortunately , the wear patterns don &apos;t match
the ones that we found at our crime scene .
maybe he borrowed somebody &apos;s bike . what about that ?
maybe , but i also dumped his phone ,
and it turns out he was putting in an order for takeout
the same time the liver was being stolen .
so it &apos;s possible that he used a different bike .
it &apos;s also possible he is great at multitasking .
but if you ask me ...
yeah , leon chase isn &apos;t our guy .
steve , this is var .
that &apos;s a lot of blood .
amir . cath .
amir .
amir , hey .
hey , come on .
amir , hey . hey , hey .
come on , amir .
you came .
yes .
it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;ll be all right .
amir , listen to me .
did the men who took your boy , did they do this to you ?
i try to rescue najib .
too ... too many .
okay .
too many .
listen , listen .
we &apos;re here now .
we &apos;re gonna get him back .
we &apos;re gonna get him back , i promise .
hey . so , check this out .
csu processed the car that bruce paloma was in ,
and they found a gps tracker hidden underneath .
all right , well , that &apos;s pretty smart .
i mean , with a tracking device like this ,
paloma can be tailed at a safe distance .
yeah .
csu also managed to pull a print off the battery inside .
they &apos;re running it through databases now .
hopefully , we &apos;ll get a hit .
we better , because that organ has an 18 @-@ hour shelf life ,
and our recipient , jason helani , is running out of time .
thank you .
no , i &apos;m good . thank you .
what ?
this ball .
what about it ?
this is what brought amir , najib and i together .
i thought battlefield trauma
brought you three together .
yeah .
the first time i met amir and najib ,
i was part of a special navy unit
that went from village to village
speaking to afghan women--
it was part outreach program ,
part intelligence gathering .
if you step on one ,
boom .
najib .
big boom .
billy .
hey , it &apos;s catherine .
listen , i need a favor .
they found me near that same field almost a year later .
i was so out of it , i didn &apos;t even remember who they were .
i had no idea until they brought me back here and i saw this .
so , let me get this straight .
uh ... you spent thousands of the taxpayers &apos; dollars ...
to get a ball back . yeah . yeah .
all right , don &apos;t move .
don &apos;t move . no , don &apos;t move .
najib ...
we &apos;re gonna find him , i promise .
amir .
do you know which faction took your boy ?
it was a splinter group ,
under the command of ... omar hassan .
hassan ?
amir , that &apos;s not possible .
omar hassan was killed in a drone strike two years ago .
he was a high @-@ value target .
it was ... it was a major operation .
he &apos;s alive .
and his men ...
take my son .
we got a hit on the print we pulled off the tracker .
meet jamie kamaka .
he has priors for assault and armed robbery ,
and according to dmv records ,
he also has a motorcycle license .
all right , let &apos;s go get him .
what &apos;s up , little man ? where you going ?
look what i found in the kitchen .
is that what i think it is ?
yeah . looks okay , too-- seal hasn &apos;t been broken .
i &apos;ll get that to kuakini right away .
okay , jamie ,
explain something to me , please , okay ?
you know that that thing &apos;s got a shelf life of 18 hours .
right ? so that means , what ,
we got 45 minutes till it &apos;s no good ?
why is it still sitting there ?
couldn &apos;t find a buyer ? what ?
right now , all i care about is a lawyer .
okay .
get him out of here .
chin , go see if there &apos;s anything else
to connect this guy to the theft .
i &apos;m gonna call makana of life , let them know they can
get jason helani ready for surgery , all right ?
what &apos;s up ?
we got the whole crime on tape .
if that &apos;s not a smoking gun , i don &apos;t know what is .
so , this is who kamaka uploaded the footage to ,
a company called attis chemical .
a chemical company ?
yeah , apparently the file went to their top two execs .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
how would these guys be connected to organ trafficking ?
i have no idea .
all right , let &apos;s see what else we got .
okay , well ,
it looks like they &apos;ve been getting some bad press lately--
allegations that their weed @-@ killer
contaminated the drinking water in waialua ,
causing a number of residents to develop cancer .
it &apos;s a big class action lawsuit over that .
that &apos;s about it though .
wait , hold on .
check out who the plaintiffs &apos; attorney is .
jason helani ?
uh @-@ huh , our organ recipient .
says right here that he was
the only lawyer willing to take the case .
maybe we &apos;ve been looking at this thing all wrong .
what if this was never about organ trafficking ?
what if attis chemical actually
arranged for that liver to be stolen
so that their opposing counsel would die of natural causes ?
because without him , there &apos;d be no lawsuit .
right .
it &apos;s a very clever way of killing someone .
and it &apos;s safer than pulling a trigger .
okay . those two .
excuse me , this is a private board meeting .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
who &apos;s taking the minutes here ?
good . make sure you get this .
at 5 : 33 p.m. ,
your ceo and cfo were both arrested .
on what charge ?
conspiracy to commit murder .
we found the wire transfer you made to jamie kamaka .
steve . huh ?
take a look at this .
this village , it &apos;s about 12 clicks away .
tell me what you see .
two pickups , one canvas @-@ topped truck .
wait a minute . amir said hassan &apos;s men were in two pickups , right ?
this has got to be them .
yeah , they must &apos;ve gone into this village to get supplies .
what about najib ?
well , my guess is , if they have him ,
they probably got him stowed away somewhere in that truck .
this village looks fortified , cath .
i don &apos;t think we can take them there .
no . no , i think our best option would be
to engage them somewhere along this road here .
what makes you think they &apos;re gonna
take that road when they move out ?
because amir also said that there were rumors
of a taliban camp at this valley to the south .
now , that &apos;s got to be where they &apos;re headed .
and this road is the only way to get there .
no ?
go ! go !
steve !
get the kids !
what are you smiling about ?
器官移植中心
well , taking down a couple corporate scumbags--
perfect way to end the day , right ?
yes , sir .
how &apos;s , uh , mr. helani doing ?
he &apos;s still in surgery , but they &apos;re optimistic .
we got there just in time .
good , good .
he &apos;s got a family that needs him .
excuse me .
hello .
danny .
catherine , is that you ? i can barely hear you .
danny , are you there ?
yeah , what &apos;s going on ? where &apos;s steve ?
they &apos;ve got him .
what do you mean ? what are you talking about ?
the taliban-- they &apos;ve captured him .
what &apos;s going on ?
hold on .
okay , danny , listen to me ,
i need you to get ahold of joe white .
tell him omar hassan is alive .
tell him there &apos;s a taliban compound in the panjshir valley .
i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s where they &apos;re gonna take steve .
you got a pen ?
yeah , yeah . i got one right now .
go ahead .
all right ,
the coordinates of the compound
are three @-@ four , two @-@ eight , niner north ,
seven @-@ zero , two @-@ two , three @-@ one east .
i got it . 34 @-@ 28 @-@ 9 north ,
70 @-@ 22 @-@ 31 east .
what about you ? are you safe ?
yeah , yeah , i &apos;m all right .
danny , i got to go . you just get ahold of joe , okay ?
all right . i &apos;m on it .
we got to go .
thank you .
what is your name ?
the woman .
where is she ?
where did she take the children ?
american navy seal .
you &apos;re him , aren &apos;t you ?
the policeman that took down
brother nazaria &apos;s soldiers in hawaii .
i &apos;m gonna do the same thing to you .
welcome .
no , thank you .
you sure ? there &apos;s no beverage service on this flight .
thanks .
we &apos;ll find her , you know .
and when we do , we &apos;ll kill her .
but tell me where she is ,
and i promise you she &apos;ll be spared .
all i want are the children .
very well .
know this , tonight , you &apos;ll die in this room .
but how you die is up to you .
if you confess your sins to the world ,
your death will be swift , merciful .
my sins ?
what have i done ?
you &apos;ve invaded our holy lands .
you &apos;re guilty of countless atrocities against the righteous .
you strap bombs onto innocent children
so they can go and kill more innocent civilians .
and you call yourselves righteous .
so be it .
we acted on the intel you provided .
recon confirms multiple hostiles at the location .
but we have no idea if commander mcgarrett was taken there .
if he was , he may already be dead .
no , no , he &apos;s alive .
how can you know that ?
because i know him . trust me , he &apos;s alive , okay ?
go time .
gentlemen , mount up .
peace be upon those who believe .
and to those who do not , know this :
until you bow to his will you will never be safe .
we shall bring the fight to your shores .
blood will be spilt in your streets .
and men like this--
they cannot protect you .
eta to helo touchdown , six minutes .
america is full of nothing but lies and debauchery .
you are a nation without values .
a nation of infidels .
and now let this man &apos;s death be a lesson to you all .
this is what ...
four tangos down . i say again , four tangos down .
steve mcgarrett ?
huh ?
are you steve mcgarrett ?
yes .
you &apos;re gonna be okay , commander .
package is secure .
way to go , boys ! yeah !
danny ?
yeah , i &apos;m right here . you all right ?
where &apos;s catherine ?
is she all right ?
relax .
hey . i spoke to her when she called me about you ,
and we got disconnected . i tried her back a couple times ,
it didn &apos;t go through .
cia . hear me ?
you &apos;re gonna need to step outside .
no , no , no . i &apos;m gonna stay right here with him .
excuse me ?
i &apos;m not a soldier ; you don &apos;t have any authority over me .
so i &apos;m gonna stay put .
okay , i &apos;m gonna make this real simple for you , commander .
we know you weren &apos;t over here alone ,
so unless you want to spend the next ten years in prison ,
you need to tell me who else was involved
and how you got your intel .
you know , hassan &apos;s boys , they , uh ...
they knocked me around pretty good .
my short @-@ term memory &apos;s a little foggy , i &apos;m sorry .
let me ask you something .
who the hell you think you are ?
you know , &apos; cause once you leave those little islands of yours ,
you &apos;re a civilian .
now , i want a name
and the source of your intel now .
like i said ,
i &apos;d love to help you , but i ...
i just can &apos;t remember .
all right , listen up .
today , you get a pass .
but these rogue ops of yours are over .
speaking on behalf of the entire u.s. military ,
you ever set foot in this part of the world again ,
you are gonna be in it up to your neck .
i don &apos;t care what you did in the service .
i will personally throw you in the brig .
we clear ?
yes , sir .
good .
now you are gonna get your ass on a plane back to the states .
make sure that happens ,
these two masters @-@ at @-@ arms are gonna escort you .
nice to meet you both .
take this out of my arm .
whoa , what are you doing ?
will you relax ?
i can &apos;t leave catherine out there by herself .
o @-@ okay . well , stop , please , okay ?
listen , you heard what the guy says .
he &apos;ll put you in jail .
we don &apos;t need that . all right ?
catherine &apos;s a big girl , she can take care of herself .
put your head down , relax . okay ?
okay ? please ? good .
what are you looking at me like that for ?
i can &apos;t believe you flew all this way .
i had to make sure you were okay .
plus , you owe me $ 500 from that poker game .
glad you find that funny .
thanks , danny .
you &apos;re welcome .
just cool out , we &apos;ll go home . all right ?
hello ? catherine ?
hey .
catherine .
where are you ? you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine , i &apos;m fine .
hassan &apos;s men were searching the area ,
and i had to lay low until they were gone .
what about the kids ?
they &apos;re safe . they &apos;re safe .
was najib with them ?
no . no , but i got a lead on where he might be .
i think they might have taken him across the border .
you &apos;re gonna go after him , aren &apos;t you ?
yeah , i am . i have to .
and @-@ and i can &apos;t come back until i find him .
okay , well , that &apos;s fine .
that &apos;s fine . i &apos;m gonna come back , all right ?
i &apos;m gonna come back . we can do this together .
i &apos;ll help you find him .
steve , no .
catherine ...
no , listen to me . you &apos;ve helped me enough , okay ?
it &apos;s better for me to do this alone .
i can keep a low profile that way .
it &apos;s just easier .
you know i &apos;m right .
you understand why i need to do this , don &apos;t you ?
yeah , of course i do .
you just promise me ...
i promise you i &apos;ll be careful .
i &apos;ll be careful , okay ?
i love you , you know .
i love you , too .
all right . good luck , cath .
thanks .
aloha .
aloha .
