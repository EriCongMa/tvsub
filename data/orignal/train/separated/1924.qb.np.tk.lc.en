&quot; we are never ever getting back together ? &quot;
sometimes , you just need to get out of town ,
get a new perspective .
but you can &apos;t always see that you need a new perspective
because you , well , need a new perspective
to be able to see that .
hey , cleveland clinic wants to know
if you can come present your paper there .
it &apos;s complicated .
why ? &apos; cause the guy who won the harper avery &apos;s too busy ?
this loss does not define you .
well , good .
so then stop trying to get me to go somewhere to get over it .
and zurich &apos;s been calling three times a day ,
wanting you to present there , too .
owen
this past year has been all about the conduit trial .
let yourself be flown first @-@ class to the alps
and take the time to figure out
what it is you want to do next .
i know what i want to do next --
get this board meeting over with .
okay , that &apos;s everybody . shut the door .
well , wait . where &apos;s avery ?
we can get started without him .
i asked hunt to share some news with you .
dr. russell spoke with me yesterday .
he &apos;s leaving the hospital .
my boss russell ?
he assured me four times
that it had nothing to do with this harper avery situation .
which means it has everything to do
with this harper avery situation .
i &apos;m sorry , am i missing something ? what situation ?
no one from this hospital will ever win a harper avery .
catherine avery told that to richard .
richard thinks we should appeal .
you mean i should appeal and humiliate myself further ?
this is not about you , yang .
this is about the hospital being able to get money
for research and to attract more surgeons .
we &apos;re already losing top talent .
eh , russell &apos;s a loss , but he &apos;s no cristina yang .
yeah , but cristina yang can &apos;t be cristina yang
if we lose funding .
the n.i.h. funds winners -- people with track records .
people with harper averys .
appealing the decision is not the worst idea in the world .
what do you think , yang ?
you in ?
let me go .
i hate this , mer .
i just want one day
where i &apos;m not reminded of the harper avery .
a @-@ and now the hospital &apos;s in danger of losing grants ?
how is being nominated for this award going to cost me grants ?
did everyone forget
that i put a printed conduit in a kid and it worked ?
a bunch of guys in zurich didn &apos;t forget .
they want you to come and speak about it .
it &apos;s a free trip .
i mean , an hour of talking for five days in the swiss alps ?
i &apos;m not running away .
i know that .
yeah , but that &apos;s what everyone &apos;s gonna think .
no , they don &apos;t .
everyone here is angry for you .
everyone supports you .
okay , can we just stop for a minute
about how the hospital is one big , happy family ?
it &apos;s a business . i get it .
catherine avery made a business decision .
i &apos;ve moved on .
everyone else should , too .
and ... there you go .
see right there ?
that little blueberry &apos;s what you &apos;ve been waiting for ...
or not .
this wasn &apos;t the idea ?
uh , well , sure .
are you looking to terminate ?
god , no , no . no , no .
okay , then .
well , get dressed and meet me in my office .
you don &apos;t want to terminate , do you ?
no .
i want us to be happy about this .
i @-@ i am happy .
the coopers chose to do their surgery here
because we &apos;ve done so many of them
that we &apos;re getting good at it .
this one is a little bit tricky
because it involves the brain .
are you ready for this ?
third time , yeah .
i &apos;m just saying , this is a very big surgery .
derek , you asked me to do it .
if you &apos;re having second thoughts about me , just --
it &apos;s too late for that now , isn &apos;t it ?
you must be annie and liz .
nothing gets past you , huh ?
be nice .
i am .
it &apos;s just unlikely he &apos;s gonna confuse us with another patient .
dr. kenzie ?
yes . the girls &apos; pediatrician .
but , for the record , we &apos;re 25 , and he &apos;s no longer our doctor .
he &apos;s more like our ... - groupie .
i was gonna say family .
our mom died few years ago ,
and since then , he &apos;s really been ... there for us .
well , it &apos;s nice to finally meet you .
i &apos;m dr. shepard .
and so am i.
his sister . mm .
good @-@ looking doctors run in the family .
and these are some of the roughly 40 people
who will be working on you .
i &apos;m not gonna ask you to learn their names .
maybe you should .
we could take a test , before and after surgery .
see if you cut through our memory centers .
will you stop saying things like that ?
i &apos;m just keeping it real .
oh , you &apos;re impossible .
oh , i am so late .
this has got to stop .
we can &apos;t stay up until 3 : 00 in the morning ,
talking about how much you love your new job .
well , that &apos;s not all we were doing .
i miss having you here .
you can always call me if you need help .
that &apos;s not why i miss you .
and why would i need help ?
i &apos;m not saying you do . i &apos;m saying if you do .
i am perfectly capable of making medical decisions
without the help of my boyfriend .
dude , you &apos;re being weird .
get out of the car before you escalate .
these are the most complex brain scans you will ever see .
as you will see , these women share brain matter .
separating them is made even more complicated by the fact --
there is one shared sagittal sinus
supplying blood to the brain .
first , we need to determine which lucky twin
gets to keep that , and the other twin gets a graft .
dr. grey and dr. webber ...
will harvest the saphenous vein .
which will be used as the new sagittal sinus .
meanwhile , dr. torres will ...
be making a mold of the cranial bone flap ,
so then we &apos;ll be able to replace the missing part of the skull ...
which we will cover with a flap for now .
but i &apos;ll place skin expanders
so we &apos;re able to fully cover the entire defect .
we need to move quickly and meticulously
to turn one brain into two with the least amount of deficit .
if this surgery scares you ,
if you &apos;re not up to the challenge , let me know .
i need everybody confident in there .
get ready .
oh . hey . i &apos;m on dr. bailey &apos;s service today , and --
dr. bailey &apos;s avoiding us .
uh , we wouldn &apos;t let her put h.i.v. into our son .
it &apos;s replacing an enzyme . it &apos;s not --
oh , we know .
but we stuck to our guns , and now look at him .
um , his numbers are fantastic ,
so i &apos;ll see if dr. bailey wants to graduate him to solid food .
oh , and tell her we &apos;re not mad at her .
oh , we &apos;re a little mad .
we &apos;re just thrilled that braden &apos;s doing so well .
okay .
sabine ?
this was frankie &apos;s pillow .
i just bit the head off of an orderly
who tried to take the pillowcase .
i should , uh -- i should probably go and apologize .
don &apos;t -- don &apos;t worry about it . don &apos;t worry about it .
but he &apos;s been so good to me .
he came to frankie &apos;s funeral ,
and he &apos;s been taking care of my family .
i &apos;m discharging you .
what ?
all of you .
link is on the transplant list .
he can wait for a heart at home .
and ivy is stable .
she should recover in her own bedroom ,
with her stuff and her friends .
we can go home ?
we can go home .
you suffered an unimaginable loss ,
and you have two kids who are alive and getting better .
your family needs to heal , and you can &apos;t do that here .
all right . that &apos;s one ticket , round trip .
and your destination is ?
zurich .
zurich it is .
you &apos;ve reached the voicemail of dr. meredith grey .
please leave a message .
hey , you &apos;re probably asleep or something .
i @-@ i have no idea what time it is there .
i barely know what day it is .
i love zurich !
well , what i &apos;ve seen of it , which is my hotel room .
but , meredith , oh , it is -- ya @-@ hoo !
this bed is like a giant &apos;s bed or something ,
if a giant were rich and liked weird @-@ shaped pillows .
i have slept for 24 hours , literally .
oh , and i have to give my talk , which is in a few hours ,
and then i &apos;m flying back .
so you can &apos;t get my chocolate .
so i @-@ i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna have time to get you your stuff .
why can &apos;t you just get it at the airport ?
wait -- you know what ?
maybe i can just grab something at the airport .
good morning .
good morning .
ultrasound &apos;s ready .
okay .
we &apos;re gonna see which saphenous vein to harvest .
ooh , that &apos;s so cold .
oh , wait . how did you --
we share some of the sensory cortex .
when they were little , i &apos;d give annie a shot ,
and lizzie would cry .
the whole office would come in
and watch us do our party trick .
it &apos;s gonna be so weird not having an audience
for everything we do .
good weird , annie .
i know . it &apos;s just i don &apos;t know how to do anything without you .
i @-@ i mean , i walk by leaning on you .
i don &apos;t drive , because you &apos;re on the driver &apos;s side .
and at work , when a client gets obnoxious ,
i let you yell at them .
well , i &apos;ll still yell at people for you and drive you to work ,
but you &apos;re gonna have to learn to walk on your own ,
or that &apos;s just gonna be weird .
stop making everything a joke .
stop thinking about mom .
i &apos;m not .
dude , we share a brain .
she just always said it was too dangerous to separate us .
your situation has changed , annie .
i think even your mother would see how necessary it is now .
your blood supplies overlap .
liz &apos;s heart is doing more work than yours ,
which is causing high @-@ output cardiac failure .
the body can &apos;t stay much longer .
meaning if we don &apos;t do anything , we both die .
i &apos;m gonna do the stupid surgery .
don &apos;t get all weepy , kenzie .
dr. bailey ...
braden morris &apos; parents think that you &apos;re avoiding them .
i &apos;m not avoiding them .
yeah , well , they want to make sure
that you know that they &apos;re not mad at you .
imagine my relief .
they &apos;re thrill , because braden &apos;s doing great .
he &apos;s got 500 t @-@ cells .
it &apos;s a miracle .
can he have solid food ?
he can have whatever he wants .
um , monitor his vitals every two hours
and get a full set of labs again in four .
okay .
wilson , i have back @-@ to @-@ back patients ,
and babs martin , my colectomy patient ,
needs a central line .
she has no peripheral access .
got it . i &apos;ll do it now .
good .
oh , no , you won &apos;t .
3922 needs her j.p. drain removed ,
and the delightful but demon @-@ like little girl
next door also needs a new feeding tube .
and they &apos;re kids -- little , tiny humans --
and we don &apos;t make little , tiny humans
wait for things like feeding tubes and drain removals , do we ?
no , we don &apos;t .
thanks . you &apos;re awesome .
okay , i will take care of twin &quot; a. &quot;
amy will take care of twin &quot; b. &quot;
dr. shepherd .
what ?
no , i mean my name is dr. shepherd .
you said &quot; amy , &quot;
and that makes me sound like some sorority girl
tagging along on your brain surgery
when , in fact , i am your co @-@ surgeon .
okay . i apologize .
everybody clear on their role ? uh , torres ?
yeah , i &apos;m good .
avery ?
yeah , me too .
amy -- uh , dr. shepherd .
i &apos;m ready .
all right .
see everybody in surgery .
get some food , people .
this is the last time you &apos;ll be eating for a while .
amy , let &apos;s go over this one more time .
all right .
mer , would you grab me an energy bar ?
yeah .
you know , he thinks you &apos;re great ,
so i don &apos;t know why he treats you like ...
i &apos;m incompetent .
because he &apos;s twin &quot; a. &quot;
always has been , always will be .
which makes me twin &quot; b. &quot; super fun .
hey , uh , raynbow williams in bed three
needs an abdominal exam to rule out appendicitis .
ooh , &quot; raynbow . &quot;
i &apos;m gonna add that to my list of baby names
really ?
yep , right after bubba , toolio , and agamemnon .
agamemnon ?
that -- that is -- that &apos;s -- that &apos;s pretty .
no , it &apos;s not . it &apos;s child abuse .
but callie keeps shooting down
all the cute names that i suggest ,
so my new strategy is to bury the cute names
in a sea of terrible ones .
so , um ... zamboni , hashtag , digger .
wow . you guys aren &apos;t even pregnant yet , and you &apos;re so --
crazy ?
no , no . i was -- i was gonna say excited .
imagine how insufferable i &apos;ll be
when there &apos;s an actual baby to talk about .
once we came up with a closed seeding system ,
we were able to speed the time
between bone @-@ marrow aspiration and graft implantation .
next .
i have a question .
yes .
does the difference in tensile strength
between the patient &apos;s tissue and the bioprinted conduit
increase the risk of turbulent flow at the anastomosis ?
no . our conduits exhibit laminar flow .
and testing revealed a tensile strength of 0.6 megapascals .
without long @-@ term follow @-@ up ,
how can you claim that your conduit
supercedes the standard prosthetic conduit ?
we expect our conduits to grow and remodel
throughout the patient &apos;s lifetime .
thus obviating the need for serial operations .
exactly .
more time @-@ consuming up front , but worth it in the long run .
don &apos;t you run the risk
of your cells undergoing apoptosis
when seeded on the hydrogel ?
that was a concern initially ,
but we discovered 90 % of the seeded cells
remained viable after one week .
i was very surprised .
fascinating .
thank you , dr. yang .
we would love to see the data from your initial patients .
oh , well , uh , your office has my e @-@ mail .
i &apos;d be -- i &apos;d be happy to share it with you .
beautiful .
you were wise to bring her , burke .
she &apos;ll teach us all a thing or two .
she certainly will .
you did this ?
i thought it was someone named weiss .
weiss is one of my staff .
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d , uh , respond to an invitation from me ,
given the circumstances of our last interaction .
me in a white dress and you fleeing the state .
well , a follow @-@ up to that is delicate .
why am i here ?
because i wanted to talk to you
about your unpublished details of your protocol .
and you brought me 6,000 miles to discuss it ?
well , this is my hospital .
i get to fly people 6,000 miles to ask them questions .
let me return the favor .
show you what i &apos;ve been working on .
i have a surgery this afternoon .
i would really love for you to scrub in ...
unless you have plans .
i have to make a phone call .
oh , go ahead .
i &apos;ll catch up with you later .
and , uh , tell meredith i said hello .
hey , is that her ?
mnh @-@ mnh . voicemail . we keep missing each other .
is she having a good time ?
uh , yeah . she &apos;s just saying her speech went well and --
burke is here .
what ?
burke . here .
shut up .
what ?
nothing , nothing .
she &apos;s saying that , um , she got a standing ovation .
i knew this trip was gonna be great for her .
mer , call me back .
i can &apos;t do this .
you guys , the last time i did this , i went --
through the table . we know . that &apos;s why we &apos;re practicing .
what are we doing ?
dr. shepherd picked leah to do the burr holes
on the cooper twins .
doesn &apos;t he know that last time she --
shut up .
how &apos;s scut ?
mm . fine . i &apos;m actually killing it .
you &apos;re killing her !
i can &apos;t do this .
stop it . that was your first one .
you know how hard to go now .
try it again .
i just think it &apos;s kind of shocking that the first option
tossed onto the table for a pregnant woman
with mixed feelings is termination .
i think she &apos;s just doing her job .
can you just be on my side ?
i am on your side .
i just don &apos;t think we need to vilify the o.b. for one comment .
i wasn &apos;t .
i @-@ i was ...
maybe i was . i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t want to fight .
me neither .
what about phoebe if it &apos;s a girl ?
phoebe freebie ? slutty .
uh , but , uh , cute .
terrific .
it &apos;s one of the better names .
dr. webber ,
did i hear that you called a meeting of the board ?
yeah , i did .
well , next time , could you please make sure i &apos;m available ?
well , we needed to discuss some issues with the foundation .
your input wasn &apos;t needed .
excuse me , sir .
if you have something to say about the foundation ,
you say it to me .
i would appreciate that .
okay , well , here &apos;s what i &apos;ll say , then .
i built this place with certain ideals in mind ,
and i &apos;m not gonna let them be trifled with .
we got in bed with your foundation too fast .
it &apos;s clear that there are certain fundamental differences of philosophy .
it &apos;s not gonna work . it &apos;s a doomed marriage .
okay , babs , let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort .
wilson , everything okay in here ?
yeah . all good . just passing the catheter .
well , you &apos;re running braden &apos;s labs ?
yeah , just like you said .
good . keep me updated on them .
all right . catheter &apos;s in .
babs , we &apos;re almost done here . i just need to remove the wire .
my lucky charm .
didn &apos;t feel a pinch .
i &apos;ve had lots of practice .
that hurts .
it &apos;s not coming out . the wire snagged on something .
oh , what &apos;s happening ? !
push 0.5 of hydromorphone .
babs , just try and relax , okay ?
the contours are virtually seamless .
i &apos;m impressed , torres .
it took hours of meticulous work to perfect these pieces , derek .
amy &apos;d better not screw it up .
why would you think that ?
you treat her like she &apos;s the village idiot .
i do not .
yes , you do .
and i need you to tell me that she &apos;s not the village idiot .
she is not the village idiot .
i wouldn &apos;t let her near the coopers
if she weren &apos;t exceedingly capable .
hey , is that the ...
a fully functioning robotic leg ? yes , it is .
well , i thought my absence totally stalled the progress .
it did .
so i kind of took it in a different direction .
i &apos;m redirecting the peripheral nerve signals
to send commands directly to the prosthetic leg ,
eliminating your sensors entirely .
i &apos;ve cut out the middleman .
oh , so i &apos;m the middleman ?
no . i still need you to connect the nerves .
so i &apos;m just the mechanic ?
kind of .
but i would never let you near it
if you weren &apos;t exceedingly capable .
you have one new message .
before you do something rash , remember a few things .
remember that he cut away pieces of you .
remember that his mama took your eyebrows .
and remember that you &apos;ve
worked the past seven years to get over --
it &apos;s just coffee .
you still drink it , right ?
you know , i &apos;m gonna go . i don &apos;t want to miss my flight .
oh , you &apos;re fine .
i had weiss put another ticket on hold for you .
you know , all this secret making of plans
and shuttling me around on your own schedule --
it &apos;s manipulative .
oh , i &apos;m sorry you see it that way .
you &apos;ve been following my work ?
you gonna tell me you haven &apos;t been following mine ?
this surgery you &apos;re about to see is new , though .
i didn &apos;t want to publish it
until i was sure i had what i thought i had .
do you ?
come on . i &apos;ll show you .
they &apos;re prepped and ready to go .
which one is twin &quot; a &quot; ?
you need to identify the twin with the best prognosis .
if things start to go poorly in surgery ,
the team throws all of their resources
toward the stronger twin -- twin &quot; a. &quot;
it &apos;s better to have one alive than neither .
i &apos;m a doctor . i know how it works .
i delivered these girls , dr. grey .
i &apos;ve been to their college graduation ,
met their boyfriends .
i helped bury their mother .
and i &apos;d like for you to tell me which is twin &quot; a &quot;
so i can ask god to take a little extra care of her sister .
lizzie is twin &quot; a. &quot;
if things go bad in there ,
all of our resources will go to her .
god help annie .
dr. grey , we &apos;re ready .
see you on the other side .
and we &apos;re gonna want doughnuts , kenzie .
don &apos;t worry , annie . i &apos;ll get you doughnuts .
we &apos;re almost finished procuring this vein .
okay , murphy , how are we doing ?
she &apos;s doing great .
she &apos;s done seven burr holes and hasn &apos;t punctured the dura .
checking the last burr hole .
well done , murphy . perfect .
delicate vascular work here .
i &apos;m sorry .
okay , next , i &apos;ll need a number 3 penfield
to strip away the sagittal sinus from the bone flap .
alex , pick up , pick up , pick up !
see ? i was right . you need me .
so , what did you screw up now ?
alex , i @-@ i -- - look.i &apos;m kidding .
and i &apos;m in the middle of a thing here .
can i call you later ?
yeah . o @-@ okay .
i &apos;ll see you later .
hi .
babs , the wire &apos;s caught on something in your chest ,
so we &apos;re gonna take an x @-@ ray
to help us see what &apos;s going on inside .
wilson .
oh , hey , i know . uh --
you know that you still haven &apos;t done the drain removal on 3922 ?
i &apos;m glad that you know that ,
because for some reason , it &apos;s not --
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m coming right now .
babs , just hang on . everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
this vessel looks like it belongs to liz .
agreed .
i &apos;ll continue my dissection millimeter by millimeter
until we &apos;re sure they &apos;re stable enough
to start ligating the remaining vessels .
the vitals , please ?
twin &quot; a , &quot; 110 / 70 .
twin &quot; b , &quot; 140 / 90 .
okay , now , i &apos;m gonna start clipping the bridging veins .
oh , no . does that look like --
yes .
damn it . it &apos;s getting dusky .
probably propagating .
tissues are edematous moving medially --
towards the sinus .
if it gets there --
both flows are compromised . i know .
what &apos;s happening ?
liz developed a clot ,
and now they &apos;re trying to keep it
from spreading to annie &apos;s brain .
they have to move quickly if they &apos;re gonna save annie &apos;s life .
we have to separate them now and fast .
dissector .
try to stay midline .
we &apos;ll control the bleeding once they &apos;ve separated .
okay , medium clips ... keep them coming .
come on , annie .
i &apos;m confused .
i thought that liz is twin &quot; a. &quot;
i thought that if things went wrong ,
we were supposed to throw all our resources to her .
not anymore .
a trancatheter aortic valve replacement .
what &apos;s so special about this ?
you &apos;ll see .
you lost the harper avery .
yes , i did .
uh , you shouldn &apos;t feel bad about it .
well , it &apos;s easy for you to say . you won one .
hmm . that &apos;s why i can say it .
there was a high after i won
and i rode it for a long time .
and then there was a truly awful crash
the fear that my best work was behind me .
and , uh , the pressure i put on myself was enormous .
i had to get away , so i came here .
started working quietly at first , and ... then i met a gentleman
that made a billion in the european bond market ,
wanted to put his name on something .
he bankrolled this whole place ,
i brought in people from all over the world just to study hearts .
you don &apos;t get government funding ?
don &apos;t need it .
the interesting thing about this patient is that he has an irregularly shaped valve .
that does not make this interesting .
does this ?
that &apos;s his heart in hologram .
composed of pre @-@ op scans .
complete intraoperative visualization .
you can see it from all angles in real time .
and even slice it to see the anatomy ,
assess the ramifications without bearing any of the risk of blind entry .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been waiting to publish .
i just wanted to get the kinks out .
was it worth you sticking around for ?
yes , it was .
wait till you see the rest of the place .
no .
irrigate the field . drape her loosely .
derek , you go with the viable twin . i &apos;ll stay here .
no , you go . i &apos;ll be right there .
i just want to try and retrieve the clot .
it &apos;s a last @-@ ditch effort , but it may work .
can you save her ?
well , if i remove all the clot fast enough ,
but she &apos;ll still have deficits .
okay , my count . on three .
1 , 2 , 3 .
don &apos;t worry about annie . i &apos;ve got her .
i know you do .
okay , let &apos;s get annie next door asap .
i need more light , heparinized shunt ,
and every nonessential person out of here .
all these printers are yours ?
yes .
there &apos;s ...
49 .
we had 50 .
one went buggy . we sent it back .
so ... you &apos;ve completed a phase i trial with your conduits .
what &apos;s next ?
i don &apos;t know . i can &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t know now . everything &apos;s ...
because of the award ?
oh , i don &apos;t care about the award .
of course you do -- at least you should .
it &apos;s an assessment from people who know that you are what you think you are .
even you crave that , regardless of --
i know how valid my work is .
so do i.
i know what &apos;s next , and it &apos;s big .
but ?
but ...
you &apos;re afraid you can &apos;t raise the support after you lost the award .
what is it ?
i want to print a functional human heart ,
a beating heart .
we &apos;ll do it here .
it &apos;s not impossible here .
you can start tomorrow . all you have to do is say yes .
so , where is yang on the appeal ?
i don &apos;t know . i haven &apos;t spoken to her since she left .
well , where is she ?
she &apos;s visiting a hospital in switzerland .
she &apos;s what ? !
is she looking for another job ? !
you see what you did ?
you go and lose the good ones one by one .
she just went to go give a talk .
i hope you &apos;re happy .
thanks to you and your mother , pretty soon ,
the only doctors working here will be you and knox .
you have to stop .
it -- it was your relationship with the harper avery foundation
that brought them here in the first place .
you &apos;re embarrassed , and -- and you &apos;re ashamed .
and i &apos;m sorry ,
but i will not let you take it out on dr. avery anymore .
he deserves your respect .
he &apos;s not his mother , so stop it .
oh , boy .
i never received babs &apos; films .
i sent them up to dr. hunt .
what ? ! why ? !
it was a critical result ,
and he &apos;s the attending on the chart .
where is she ?
with dr. hunt . took her upstairs to surgery .
oh , steph i need you !
uh , can you go check on braden morris &apos; labs ?
bailey is checking for leukocytosis to rule out leukemia .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
leukemia ? why is bailey ...
how &apos;s annie &apos;s saphenous vein graft coming ?
patent , thankfully .
good .
need an extra set of hands ?
no . i &apos;m just about to close the dura .
good .
wow . shepherd fixed lizzie already ?
he didn &apos;t fix her .
dr. hunt , i @-@ i should have called you .
if not me , then someone .
this hospital is full of doctors , wilson .
because you tried to remove the wire by yourself forcefully ,
you perforated the posterior wall of the subclavian vein ,
causing her to bleed .
oh , god .
and now i have to perform an emergency venous repair ,
and her colectomy has to be postponed .
i @-@ i was trying to handle everything --
and you made it worse .
sit down . i &apos;ll order some dinner .
are you not hungry ?
you want me to come work here ?
that &apos;s what i said , yes .
i no longer have the ability to interpret your noises .
is this some ploy to get me back in your life ?
because i &apos;m not interested .
my wife , edra .
that is simone . she &apos;s 5 .
vivianna just turned 4 .
i &apos;m happy , cristina .
edra is the love of my life .
she &apos;s my world .
my family is my world .
that &apos;s nice .
i don &apos;t want you , cristina .
and , um , okay , i @-@ i don &apos;t mean it like it sounds .
no , i mean edra wants to be a mom .
she trained as a surgeon , and she gave it up .
now she stays home and takes care of the kids .
she &apos;s supportive of me , of my dreams .
well , that &apos;s good for you .
i &apos;m happy for you .
when you do
what you and i do as fiercely as we do it ,
you need somebody that &apos;s willing to stay home
and keep the home fires burning .
that &apos;s the only way you and i are ever gonna have someone .
you don &apos;t know me anymore .
i see your life has moved on .
i want you to know mine has , too .
you &apos;re right .
i don &apos;t know you .
but i know that you &apos;ve become a magnificent surgeon .
and you &apos;ve become everything i dreamed you &apos;d be .
you should be in a place like this .
you should consider it .
he has a family and a holographic heart ,
and he wants to bankroll my research
for printing a functional heart .
i mean , he &apos;s got like 49 printers
and a bottomless pit of money and --
how the hell are you not answering your phone right now ? !
mer , everything i have ever wanted is here ...
except he &apos;s here .
so what the hell am i supposed to do ?
i mean what would you tell me to do ?
yeah .
annie decided to withdraw care ?
any change on lizzie ?
no . they &apos;ll be withdrawing care soon .
you do remember how hard it was
to find the money to keep this place going .
the foundation was our hail mary , and you saved us .
we have to find a way to make it work with them .
i was there
the night your mother won her first harper avery .
i wasn &apos;t with her . i @-@ i was sitting in the back .
because my father was with her ?
that award was our gold standard .
it was the measure of our success .
it was everything we worked for .
and i had to be there to see the look on her face .
she was radiant .
catherine made it meaningless with this .
she cheapened it .
she cheapened our goals .
she cheapened her memory .
i can &apos;t stand that .
richard , you got a minute ?
dr. bailey , i have braden &apos;s most recent results .
oh , thank you , dr. edwards .
you &apos;re testing his white blood cell differential .
i &apos;m running many tests . his t @-@ cell count is up .
a boy with no immune system grew over 500 t @-@ cells overnight .
i think you administered the deactivated virus
against his parents &apos; wishes .
okay , it worked !
and it &apos;s working .
it &apos;s amazing .
you &apos;re amazing .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so you agree ?
this resident &apos;s not cut out to be a surgeon .
yep . either you &apos;re a surgeon or you &apos;re not .
i can &apos;t get fired . my parents will disown me .
i &apos;ll end up back in school .
i &apos;ll end up back in jail .
will you stop ?
if any one of us is fired , it &apos;s me .
i went crazy very publicly .
i disrupted an entire o.r.
i &apos;m a surgical liability .
and shepherd hates me now .
hunt hates me .
you should have seen his face today when i screwed up .
my ex owns the hospital .
it &apos;s me .
i heard that residencies sometimes clean house ,
like fire an entire class of residents and start fresh .
hey . what ?
nothing .
i just had a really good day .
oh . next round &apos;s on him .
you spoke to meredith ?
no .
and , uh , no , i can &apos;t take the job .
thank you for the offer , but ... no .
meredith carries a grudge .
this has nothing to do with meredith or a grudge .
it &apos;s far from that simple .
really ?
please don &apos;t .
you got me here . we had our fun .
take no for an answer .
why ?
why ?
honestly , it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
you think i want to work for you again ?
i never wanted to work for you .
i wanted to be you .
the best thing that ever happened to me
was you walking away from our wedding .
it made me stand on my own two feet .
i am better for it . you are better for it .
will you just hold ...
so why bring me here ?
why offer me a job you know i can &apos;t resist ?
you gonna dangle the carrot ,
and i &apos;m supposed to chase at it until you snatch it away ?
i don &apos;t want the job .
are you done ?
no !
now i am .
i don &apos;t want you to work for me .
us working together would
destroy my marriage , my life .
the way i loved you was consuming ,
and eventually ...
... you hold the carrot , and i &apos;ll be chasing you .
i have a family now , a life that ...
a life i want .
i don &apos;t want you to work for me .
you just offered me a job .
i don &apos;t want you to work for me .
i want you to take over for me .
i am leaving .
edra &apos;s parents are in milan ,
and she wants to be closer to them .
wait .
she has made so many sacrifices for me ,
and now i think it &apos;s time for me to do the same for her .
wait .
i have been wanting to leave for a while now ,
but i just haven &apos;t been able to find anyone
that i was willing to give the institute to , until now .
wait .
you &apos;re offering me your hospital ,
like you &apos;re willy wonka

and you &apos;re handing me a chocolate factory ?
cheer up , charlie .
you &apos;re not serious ?
you are serious .
this place is yours , cristina , if you want it .
do you ?
open your eyes .
how did you know i was --
i know who you hang out with .
you okay ?
yeah .
yeah . i just needed to sit down for a bit .
should probably get used to these seats , though .
i can &apos;t change who i am .
but that doesn &apos;t mean i want to sit at home every sunday
when my family &apos;s off at church .
you would go to church with me ?
you &apos;re my wife .
of course i will .
as long as we can get waffles after .
we can have waffles after .
what do you see ?
more possibilities ?
agamemnon .
i kind of love it .
thank you .
callie torres has a really interesting project .
she needs an exceptional neurosurgeon .
i recommended you .
derek , i don &apos;t live here .
maybe you should .
i like having you here .
you &apos;re -- you &apos;re my favorite sister .
you say that to all of us .
but i will choose to believe you ,
because you are my favorite brother .
does your new view give you more hope ?
that &apos;s the goal .
although it doesn &apos;t always work out that way .
chocolate .
i ate some .
you &apos;re leaving .
sometimes , a shift in perspective
