those pancakes smell great .
what are you doing with those ?
luke and i are doing a recycling drive .
if we collect enough bottles
they build a school in africa .
wouldn &apos;t that be so cool
to go to a school made out of bottles ?
that would certainly be a special school .
did you hear what i said , parents ?
&quot; special school &quot; ?
okay , nobody make a big deal about it ,
but i just broke up with dylan .
no
oh , my gosh . are you okay , honey ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine . i just
i need to date someone who has a clue ,
instead of an idiot
who bangs his head every time he rides his bike out of his garage
every time !
i &apos;m sorry , honey .
i &apos;m sorry for both of you .
i &apos;ll have to text him later .
mmm . i gotta jump in the shower . i &apos;m gonna be late .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m going to meet my friend valerie .
i haven &apos;t seen her in 15 years .
we used to work together .
you worked ?
mm @-@ hmm .
can &apos;t imagine you working .
luke , let me tell you something .
that is very offensive to women .
your mom works very hard .
it &apos;s just now she works for us .
i will have you know that i had quite the little career going .
i was an account manager at starcrest hotels .
i had a little cubicle ,
and @-@ and i wore my tennis shoes to work ...
and changed into my work pumps .
it was very working girl .
that movie &apos;s so clutch
mm @-@ hmm .
i don &apos;t mind saying i was making quite a splash .
well , then , why &apos;d you quit ?
well , haley , call me old @-@ fashioned ,
but i wanted to focus on raising a family .
so i married your dad .
five months later , we ... were ...
four months away from having this little bundle of joy .
mm @-@ hmm .
there &apos;s my lawyer .
gloria got into a little car accident ,
so my dad asked me to help her out .
and , uh , this is the first
time that my dad &apos;s asked me for legal advice ,
and it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s nice .
it &apos;s nice to know that he respects me in that way .
well , mitchell is an amazing lawyer .
my dream for him is that one day he &apos;ll be on the supreme court .
why , cam ?
so at parties
i can tell everyone my partner is one of the supremes .
there he is @-@ the steely , grizzled veteran ...
ready to do battle with the plucky upstart .
speed versus grace .
brute force versus
let &apos;s just do this .
jay and i are both gym rats .
i love the sauna . that &apos;s the dry heat .
and the steam , wet .
and , of course , i am just a kook for racquetball .
club champ two years in a row ,
tonganoxie , missouri rec center .
so , naturally , jay and i have been trying for months ...
to get together to bang the old hollow rubber ball around .
i have been avoiding this day like the plague .
i mean , part of going to the gym is the lockerroom atmosphere .
and if i &apos;m there with a gay guy ,
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s just not gonna be the same .
i mean , for me , it &apos;s a locker room .
for him , it &apos;s a showroom .
she doesn &apos;t get it .

* i &apos;ll let you see my scar *
what the hell ?
some people call me a salesman .
i call myself a sales friend .
so obviously , i need strangers to trust me .
i don &apos;t take kindly to it
when someone tom sellecks my bus bench .
在播美剧 《 警察世家 》 中弗兰克的扮演者 &#93;
phil dunphy .
phil , it &apos;s barbara .
the pattersons wanna back out of the deal .
why ? what happened ?
the wife &apos;s getting cold feet .
i told her to call you .
okay , fine .
i &apos;ll handle it . i &apos;m not losing this sale .
by the way
i &apos;ve spent way too much time on it .
phil , do you take elm when you come to work ?
i saw it , barbara .
it &apos;s a terrific gym , jay .
very liberal with the towels . i love that .
showers are private , in case you wondered .
i wasn &apos;t , but thanks for the heads @-@ up .
now , that &apos;s a surprise . boxers .
is that necessary ?
well , i just always pictured you as a tighty @-@ whitey guy .
well , do me a favor . the next time you picture me ,
leave the underwear out of it .
well , don &apos;t you worry . the only thing i &apos;m picturing ...
is how clean the floor &apos;s gonna be when i &apos;m done mopping it with you .
is that the best you can do ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s gonna take a little more than some
lame trash talk to get me out of my-
gaah ! what the hell was that ?
our butts pressed against each other .
they didn &apos;t press . it was glancing .
stop talking about it !
oh come on . all the time you &apos;ve spent in a locker room ,
this can &apos;t be your first moon landing .
you got a name for it ?
it &apos;s very common .
you got off easy .
at least it didn &apos;t happen after a shower .
enough .
we call that a splashdown .
that &apos;s it . i &apos;m changing in the stall . excuse me !
i saw the picture , dylan .
you had your arm around her with that humpy look you get .
no , that &apos;s not always how you look . we &apos;re over !
so , i &apos;d really like to talk to you , mrs. patterson ,
see if we can &apos;t turn this thing around .
uh , you &apos;ve got my number .
thank you .
i said we are over .
why don &apos;t you go out for a nice bike ride ?
dylan again , huh ?
some guys just do not know how to play it .
dad , what are you doing ?
oh , right .
just , uh , test @-@ driving my new soup strainer .
i dug it out of the halloween stuff
to see what people think .
do people want their real estate advice ...
from someone who leads or from someone who follows ?
i &apos;m betting these babies are coming back in a big way .
buy low , sell high .
people are gonna see this and say , &quot; that guy &apos;s high . &quot;
sorry to bother you , sir .
we &apos;re doing work next door and nicked a main ,
so we &apos;re gonna have to shut down your water .
oh . okay . no problem .
it shouldn &apos;t be too long . if you happen to need it ,
there &apos;s a porta @-@ potty out front .
thanks . hey .
yeah .
nice mustache .
yeah , man . you too , brother .
&quot; you too , brother . &quot;
haley @-@ she &apos;s the oldest . fifteen .
and then alex is 13 .
and that &apos;s my baby , luke . he &apos;s 11 .
can you believe it ?
oh , my god , they &apos;re gorgeous .
yeah .
and things are still good with phil the thrill ?
yes . things are great . great with him .
i &apos;m so happy for you . really .
i &apos;m so @-@ i &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re happy .
thank you . well , and you too .
i mean , your life is
no , no , no @-@ let &apos;s talk about you .
okay .
because , you know , you &apos;re
you chose the mother . you &apos;re the mommy .
the yummy mommy , mama , person
you &apos;re kinda squeezing the ring right into my finger .
was i ?
a little .
i &apos;m so sorry .
and just then , it hit me . she was jealous of me .
yes , there &apos;d always been a little bit of a competition between us .
this was more serious .
she was looking at my life as something ...
that she &apos;d always wanted , but never had .
so how &apos;s life in the trenches ?
you still got the bastards on the 23rd floor ...
making life miserable for all the people actually doing the work .
same as ever , right ?
one @-@ one difference .
mm @-@ hmm ?
i &apos;m one of them bastards now .
wait . you &apos;re on the 23rd floor ?
i &apos;m on the 24th floor .
wow . that &apos;s insane . it &apos;s
it &apos;s no big deal .
i mean , if you hadn &apos;t left , it probably would have been you .
i was driving along this street .
the cars were parked just like this .
and boom , out of nowhere , he hits me .
okay , so , he @-@ he cut you off ?
yes .
right .
a crazy driver .
you know , i used to be a little bit like that .
i don &apos;t know , maybe it &apos;s because of lily ,
but i &apos;ve definitely become more considerate .
like , i used to never let people in , and now i do .
just now getting that metaphor . okay .
so , what do you think ?
were there any witnesses ?
no , just manny . he was in the back seat .
okay .
it all happened so fast--just like they say .
yeah . all right . well , this is what we &apos;re gonna do .
i &apos;ll take a few pictures ,
and then we &apos;ll sit down and write a statement .
perfect . i &apos;ll go and get us a table .
all right .
manny , come .
uh , just a minute , mom . i need to tie my shoe .
okay .
mitchell .
yeah ?
don &apos;t talk . listen . it was her fault .
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
don &apos;t look at me .
do something . take pictures .
manny ! what kind of cupcake do you want ?
um , that &apos;s okay . i &apos;m not hungry .
that was a mistake . now she &apos;ii know something &apos;s up .
are you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
she cut that guy off . she &apos;s a terrible driver .
she &apos;s a danger to us all .
okay , wait . now stop .
i thought she said he was parked and then he cut her off .
everybody looks parked when you &apos;re going a hundred miles an hour .
manny , why didn &apos;t you speak up ?
she can &apos;t take criticism about her driving .
once an old lady yelled at her at a crosswalk .
she honked so long , the horn ran out .
manny !
i &apos;ve said too much already .
are you hearing this ?
aw , that &apos;s
point .
hinder !
lucky shot !
that is game and , i believe , match .
yeah , fine , you won . but , you know , what do you expect ?
for the first half of the game ,
i was distracted by what happened in the locker room .
and you &apos;re sure it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a fabulous racquetball player ?
you &apos;re average . but i was a little thrown by you touching me .
which is unnatural . not to you , of course .
no , to you it &apos;s like rocket fuel .
oh , sure . when you &apos;re gay you just walk around
giving butt bumps to everybody .
it &apos;s like a high five . it &apos;s a low two .
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna prove
that you won only because i was distracted .
we &apos;re gonna have a rematch right here , right now .
so you want to go up against me again ?
yes .
no ! damn it .
hello !
hey , dad . uh , did you know that the accident was gloria &apos;s fault ?
yes . i mean , i wasn &apos;t there ,
but she &apos;s a horrible driver .
if she hit 10 cars , i wouldn &apos;t be surprised .
if you knew it was her fault , why did you get me involved ?
because someone has to tell her she &apos;s in the wrong ,
and better you than me .
that &apos;s great . here i am thinking
that my dad actually respects me as a lawyer ,
and really you &apos;re just throwing me to the wolves .
can &apos;t it be both ?
okay .
dad , it doesn &apos;t bother you in the least ...
that your gay son is the only one
tough enough to stand up to your wife ?
go get &apos; em , rocky . see you later .
your father and i had a moon landing in the locker room .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
what about you ? do you ever get serious with anyone ?
sure . oh , no . not yet .
oh , honey , you will .
oh , no , i hope not . it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s fun .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just @-@ i &apos;m waiting for some news .
what news ?
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m up for the paris job .
the @-@ the head of the international division ?
that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s crazy .
yeah , no . i mean , i &apos;ll never get it , but it &apos;d be great ...
&apos;cause one of my lovers lives in paris .
wow . i @-@ i don &apos;t know what jumps out of that sentence more-
you know , &quot; lovers &quot; or &quot; one of . &quot;
well , i &apos;m single . i mean , it &apos;s kinda what you do .
uh @-@ huh .
i have one in paris .
um , i have paris , new york , miami .
i have a fourth one .
i &apos;m forgetting one lover . i &apos;m forgetting one lover .
mmm .
last night i vacuumed the radiator thingy under the fridge .
you know , it collects the dust .
cause you should , and i don &apos;t . so-
oh , hey , hold on . cross your fingers .
i &apos;m not gonna lie .
the thought of valerie getting the one job
in the whole company that everyone coveted
well , i wasn &apos;t a &quot; lover &quot; of that .
okay . okay , thank you .
well ?
oh , they haven &apos;t made a decision .
they &apos;re @-@ they &apos;re gonna tell me later on .
that &apos;s not what they said , is it ?
uh , yeah , it is .
oh , valerie , come on . it &apos;s me .
what are friends for ,
if not to be there for you when you get bad news ?
i got it .
oh , my god . aaah !
i &apos;m the head of europe .
well , you know , for the hotel-
not the continent .
kind of though . kind of .
why didn &apos;t you tell me when you first heard ?
oh , &apos; cause , you know
and that &apos;s when it really hit me .
valerie wasn &apos;t jealous of me . she pitied me .
and part of me wanted to take her back to the house ...
and show her everything she was missing ...
in her sad , childless , husbandless life .
but there &apos;s a little thing called &quot; taking the high road . &quot;
why don &apos;t you come by and meet everybody ?
oh , sure . that &apos;d be great .
yeah , i mean , alex is just a genius ,
and haley is turning into this beautiful young woman ,
and it makes me realize that motherhood is
san francisco .
the most important
that was my fourth lover . san francisco .
it would have kept me up all night .
yeah .
dad , look .
just a sec , buddy . i &apos;m on my way out to the bathroom .
check it out . the aubreys had this huge party last night ,
and we got all these bottles to recycle .
great .
what &apos;s jegermeister ?
well , you know how in a fairy tale ...
there &apos;s always a potion that makes the princess fall asleep ,
and then the guys start kissing her ?
well , this is like that , except you don &apos;t wake up in a castle ,
you wake up in a frat house with a bad reputation .
haley !
luke , you &apos;re spilling it !
aw , crud .
god
gross ! a rat !
cool .
hang on . i &apos;m coming .
i believe you have something that belongs to me .
my heart .
i thought i i.m. &apos; ed you to stay away .
ow ! haley .
hello ? dylan ? d @-@ money ?
hey , buddy ! hey , buddy !
hello , friendly neighbors !
little help ?
but i love you .
well , you should have thought about that ...
before you took that skank sharon nicolini
to an anne hathaway movie .
i didn &apos;t take her . she was just there .
so you were just there by yourself at an anne hathaway movie ?
i don &apos;t think so !
yeah . yeah . i like her movies .
she &apos;s every woman . come on . let &apos;s not fight .
let &apos;s just discuss this like two un @-@ immature adults .
hello ? mrs. patterson .
hi . i &apos;ve been waiting for your call .
yeah . uh , is there any chance that maybe we could talk a little bit-
no , no , no , no . now &apos;s perfect . that &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m sorry . i couldn &apos;t hear you . let me just close my office door .
there we go . much , much better .
okay . maybe , uh , we should go over the accident one more time .
put the dogs on a row . you &apos;re such a good lawyer .
gloria使用错误 &#93;
uh , i just wanna make sure
we &apos;re 100 % clear on exactly what happened .
oh , we &apos;re clear . i told you .
what ? you don &apos;t believe me ?
no , no . i just-
you know , sometimes you can forget tiny details .
like , is it possible , maybe , uh , you were driving too fast ?
who said i was driving fast ?
yeah , who ?
i just @-@ i &apos;m looking at the street ,
and i &apos;m thinking if you were driving a little fast ,
it &apos;s possible that maybe you
didn &apos;t see the car
you &apos;re like everyone else , huh ?
you blame the latino driver .
where i come from , they always blame the latino driver .
where you come from , isn &apos;t everybody a latino driver ?
manny , tell him .
i can &apos;t &apos; cause i have a cupcake in my mouth .
oh , come on . don &apos;t blame your cupcake .
what ? you think i &apos;m guilty too ?
no .
fine .
i don &apos;t need you as a lawyer anymore .
and if you two think i &apos;m such a bad driver ,
you &apos;re safer walking home .
chao .
here it is .
it &apos;s really cute .
yeah . we &apos;re pretty proud of it .
here &apos;s your stupid cds ...
and your clothes and your poems !
don &apos;t you do it !
oh , i &apos;m doing it .
haley , stop it . what are you doing ?
tearing out my heart .
oh , why don &apos;t you go get a hickey from sharon nicolini ?
it &apos;s from my guitar strap , haley .
oh , thanks for reminding me .
that &apos;s my daughter haley
and her boyfriend , dylan , um
this is a nice color .
yeah . um , listen . this is not normal ,
with all that , nor @-@ nor is that liquor smell .
phil , honey ? oh , my god . luke , what is that ?

he went outside to go to the bathroom .
it &apos;s ... not usually like this . oh , gross .

she looks great , doesn &apos;t she ?
what is on your face ?
one time ! once !
one time i bring somebody home ...

a bunch of booze @-@ drenched hill people ...
just sitting around in their underwear and @-@ and chasing rats ...
and fornicating in the stairwell .
can i say something ?
no . no , you can &apos;t , mario .
there is nothing left to say but thank you .
thank you all .
i told you i &apos;d win .
not talking so much now , are you , hotshot ?
hope you enjoy that nice , hot shower ,
but it &apos;s not gonna wash away the shame of that 15 @-@ 7 beatdown .
you should have seen the look on your face ...
when that drop shot just kissed the wall .
ah . okay , splashdown .
got me again . yep .
make the uptight straight guy all embarrassed .
except for one thing -doesn &apos;t even bother me anymore .
i could do this all day . here , another one for you .
maybe a couple of &apos; em .
jay , i just noticed a sauna back here .
how big of a hurry are we in ?
biggest hurry of your life .
&apos;scuse me . &apos; scuse me .
well , if you &apos;re going to be stranded ,
might as well be in a place full of cupcakes .
i don &apos;t think you need any more .
ay . i &apos;m sorry , guys .
it &apos;s true . i am a defensive driver .
you mean you &apos;re defensive about
i know what i am .
let &apos;s go .
it &apos;s just that i don &apos;t like when people just assume
that i &apos;m a bad driver .
maybe it was just , like , a little bit my fault .
well , i &apos;m glad you can admit that , gloria .
but i &apos;m still gonna need you as my lawyer , mitch .
why ?
because this one
it was not my fault , i promise you .
that &apos;s what that sound was .
it was the big cupcake .
that was unreal . mom was crazy .
i &apos;m scared .
look . i know your mom pretty well . she &apos;s fine .
i &apos;d be willing to bet she &apos;s just composing herself ,
taking a nice , long , peaceful walk in the park .
perfect .
at that moment all i wanted was to be with my family .
but of course , that meant finding a way to apologize ...
to the people that i had belittled and rejected .
okay , you are so crazy . that song totally rules .
daddy , you &apos;re crazy .
crazy right .
hey , honey .
hi .
hey , mom . come on . sit down .
no , seriously , dad . it &apos;s lame .
seriously , luke . it &apos;s not .
you got some mustard or something on your face .
i think i know a little bit about music .
i was a dj in college .
i had my own show in the coveted time slot .
daybreak with dunphy .
are you kidding me ?
no , i &apos;m not kidding you . and i played rick astley .
dad , that &apos;s embarrassing .
never gonna give , sing it , luke .
they could have been petty .
they really could have made me pay , but they didn &apos;t .
never loved &apos; em more .
why the hell couldn &apos;t valerie have seen them like that ?
hey , dylan .
hey , mr. dunphy .
what &apos;s happening ?
well , haley and i got into another fight .
oh . say anything .
um , good morning ?
no . say anything .
newspaper .
no , dylan . say anything . clutch movie .
clutch movie .
she probably won &apos;t be up for a couple hours still .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s not that heavy .
