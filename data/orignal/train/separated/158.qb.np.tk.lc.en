第一季 第七集
okay , so you can meet people ,
become a part of something .
nathaniel i &apos;m shocked .
i thought you were strictly an herbal man .
this isn &apos;t mine .
... which is how i found this .
it isn &apos;t mine ,
and it isn &apos;t your father &apos;s .
what do you have to say for yourself , nate ?
you said you love me .
loved you .
i &apos;m sorry i kissed you , but i did it
because i thought he should know how it feels to lose you .
i like you , only you .
that &apos;s good because i feel the same about you .
the masks come off at midnight , and i kind of need my disguise .
you know what ? you wanna trade ?
sure .
serena , i know we both care about blair ,
but maybe the best thing is for me
to just tell her the truth .
i &apos;m not over you. oh !
nate ? serena .
hey ! have you seen nate ?
jenny .
have you heard , upper east siders ?
burlesque is all the rage again ,
and sometimes a little raging is exactly what you need .
and as always ,
chuck &apos;s aiming to be ahead of the curves .
who &apos;s that girl ?
i have no idea .
but let &apos;s not get ahead of ourselves .
2 days earlier
you want your dad to invest in a strip joint ?
how midtown. a burlesque club
a respectable place , where people can be transported to another time ,
where they can feel free to let loose .
no judgment. pure escape .
what happens at victrola stays at victrola .
well , it does have franchise potential .
chuck bass ,
i do believe all your years of underage boozing
and womanizing have finally paid off .
truly , i am proud .
and you are my toughest critic .
well , second toughest .
so do you think your father will go for it ?
it is exactly the kind of innovative thinking
upon which the bass empire was built .
it is the perfect thing . i &apos;ve been waiting for this .
we are so late.are you coming
gotta pitch it to bart .
victory party here tomorrow .
i wouldn &apos;t miss it .
i &apos;ll send a car .
don &apos;t be nervous. he &apos;s gonna love it .
they all seem very discreet. it &apos;s up to you ,
but you will choose a facility , and you will get the help that you need ,
after our dinner with eleanor &apos;s tomorrow night , of course
unless you &apos;d like to ruin the celebration
honoring your father &apos;s new business union with eleanor .
anne , it &apos;s all right. let me talk to him .
how could you not tell her the drugs were yours ?
you &apos;re not gonna end up in one of these places .
let me talk to her .
you know how your mother overreacts .
yeah , &apos; cause it &apos;s mom who &apos;s the problem , right ?
look , work &apos;s been kicking my ass lately .
the old man doesn &apos;t wear the hours as well as he used to .
this young viper at the office , frank meltzer ,
saw me fading one night , so he offered me a pick @-@ me @-@ up .
it was stupid . i didn &apos;t even like it .
hey , i &apos;ll flush the bag right now , all right ?
dad , i just want you to be
look , let &apos;s not put a damper on the upcoming festivities .
i &apos;ve landed the waldorf account ,
and my son has landed the waldorf .
so that &apos;s it ?
hey , i &apos;m not cutting the conversation short .
drinks after school at the club ?
nonalcoholic , of course .
no , you don &apos;t understand , vanessa .
okay , the store lent it to me for the ball ,
and if i don &apos;t find it , blair is gonna kill me .
it &apos;s under her name ,
and she doesn &apos;t even know i went .
no , alison , i sent that two weeks ago .
dad , have you seen a bracelet ?
you know , round , silverish , sparkly ? yeah ,
i think i saw that next to that ambiguous vague thing
by the nondescript place .
he hasn &apos;t seen it .
no , alison , i @-@ wh--i haven &apos;t told them anything yet .
well , what should i be telling them
when i don &apos;t even know what &apos;s ...
who you talking to ?
your mother. tell her i say hi .
jenny says hello .
who are you talking to ?
where &apos;s the other humphrey ?
ow. brick not comfortable .
all right , i &apos;ll take one for the team .
ooh ! yeah , this is definitely not very comfortable .
i know. you &apos;d think all the money that we spent on this private school ,
they could at least give us a comfortable spot to make it out
or a better chemistry teacher. mr. peiser is a little weird .
wait , you &apos;re thinking about mr. peiser right now ?
we are at school .
hey , serena. ugh .
why don &apos;t you get a room ?
oh , that &apos;s the plight of the manhattan teenager .
no cars .
you know , we could find a place more private .
our parents aren &apos;t always home .
that &apos;s true .
they must eventually leave .
the problem is waiting for eventually .
what &apos;s the rush ? really , it &apos;s not like this sucks .
minus the brick and the paparazzi .
spotted , serena and not @-@ so @-@ lonely boy
clearly past courtship in the courtyard .
bye .
you know , we should talk about this , though ,
about us ,
about eventually .
definitely. yes .
or we could just get it over with in a broom closet .
in a broom closet ?
that is-- that is rich , serena .
mr. peiser &apos;s waiting .
but can brooklyn keep up with the uptown express ?
oh. serena , right ?
uh , that &apos;s ... funny .
mm , not really. no .
no .
uh , what are you doing in the girls &apos; hall ?
i was actually looking for you .
you know , i really didn &apos;t mean anything i said about having feelings for serena .
maybe you didn &apos;t . i just
i mean , i don &apos;t even care , but other people might .
yeah , i know .
yeah , including my brother .
you brought me chocolates ?
well , i know you care about being friends with blair ,
and your brother-- he &apos;s with serena ,
and i just really need you to help me out here .
you promise ?
promise what ?
uh , promise to help me come up with a more creative apology than these .
oh . i &apos;m sorry for taking you for granted lately , okay ?
that is so sweet ! but i prefer the gold collection ,
but thank you .
hey , cinderella .
i think you dropped this at the ball .
i hate secrets more than anything .
you know that .
friends don &apos;t lie , and we &apos;re friends , right ?
right .
jenny humphrey &apos;s rise to the penthouse has been short and sweet
but if she crosses blair waldorf ,
it &apos;s straight back to the basement .
looks like this little lamb needs to stay silent or else .
when can i go public with you ?
my kids have to know first .
well , your secret &apos;s safe with me .
father .
chuck .
um , well ... bart ,
um , i think your points earlier were excellent ...
mm @-@ hmm. and , um , i plan to bring them up
at the next parent teacher meeting .
um , thank you , lily .
not much future as an actress .
you don &apos;t say anything to serena .
you don &apos;t say anything to anyone .
lily would like this to play out in a certain way .
so you &apos;re serious about her ?
what &apos;s with the business formal ?
are you being arraigned for something ?
i have an investment idea
i think is utterly unique to your company .
something avant @-@ garde , yet nostalgic .
it is the perfect way for you to loosen the top button of bass , inc .
like you &apos;ve been wanting , sir .
i am so pleased .
you are ?
are you kidding me ?
do you how long i &apos;ve been waiting for you
to be interested in something other than partying ?
you should come see the place .
it sells itself .
i have some meetings , but , uh , how &apos;s after--
a @-@ after &apos;s--after &apos;s great .
after &apos;s good .
so ... i heard on &quot; gossip girl &quot;
that you were having sex with dan out here ...
in streaming video .
ugh ! god , kati and is filmed us ?
oh , it &apos;s all very &quot; high school musical &quot; scandalous .
and no , they haven &apos;t streamed it yet , but ...
i heard it was ... aggressive .
i must say , dan has been surprisingly good
at everything we &apos;ve done .
which is ... everything ?
no ! but feel free to ask any personal questions .
but you &apos;ve talked about it , right ?
no , mom , we haven &apos;t .
may i remind you that this is your first real boyfriend , s . ,
and in relationships , you talk about stuff .
i know , but i don &apos;t know , sometimes talking about it or planning
it can ruin a good thing , you know ?
i would know .
well , as long as you &apos;re not worried .
well , i &apos;m not , but i don &apos;t know , he might be .
is it possible for a guy to want to slow things down ?
only the guys we like .
but ... with you ,
i can &apos;t imagine why .
how was i ?
i don &apos;t know. let &apos;s ask the judges. hmm .
i was gonna give you a 3,
but since you &apos;re a virgin , i gave you an extra point .
hey , i chose to wait .
sex is meaningful , like art ,
and you don &apos;t rush art .
who &apos;s art ? did you sleep with him ?
did you sleep with him ?
did you or did you not sleep with him ?
yes , alison , i did encourage you to do your paintings ,
not the next door neighbor .
hello ?
hello ?
ah , dan , i @-@ i didn &apos;t realize you were home .
i &apos;m sorry you had to hear that .
well , i did. something about , uh , uh , mom and a neighbor ?
yeah , it &apos;s ... complicated .
mom &apos;s having an affair. it &apos;s easy when you just say it .
not to your son .
well , she hasn &apos;t exactly been rushing back to us .
it &apos;s good to know why .
i &apos;m home. what &apos;s going on , dad ?
uh , nothing. just gotta get some groceries .
dan ?
uh , sorry , jen . i got a lot of homework , so ...
ey , dad . i &apos;m , like , ten blocks away .
what ?
oh , sorry , nate .
i have to take a rain check on our drink .
why ?
client in crisis. can &apos;t get out of the office ,
but i &apos;ll be home as soon as i can .
well , dad , our talk was kind of important .
it &apos;s business , nate .
you understand , right ?
we &apos;ll talk later .
looks like parents can be deceiving n both sides of the bridge .
you are ...
really talented .
dad .
i , uh , ahem . i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d make it .
and you want me to pour hundreds of thousands of dollars
into an excuse for you to be around booze and women ?
no. no , i ... did you read the proposal ?
it shows a much bigger picture .
i came down here because i saw the effort you made .
you want to impress me with your commitment to something ?
try getting a few a &apos;s in school or maybe a part @-@ time job .
looks like the pot calling the kettle black has young bass boiling over ,
and if we know chuck
he &apos;s not one to let things lie .
someone pour that man a drink .
you need to look elegant for the archibald dinner tomorrow night ,
so what do you think ?
yes , it would be very nice , if i was sailing up on the mayflower .
anne archibald was wearing her amazing
cornelius vanderbilt diamond ring the other night .
she was going on and on about how it would end up on your finger ...
someday .
wait .
nate spoke to hismother about our future ?
he actually asked for the family ring ?
looks like cold , hard cash an get you the cold , rd truth .
didn &apos;t anyone tell you , n . ? be careful what you fish for .
can &apos;t believe we actually got the apartment to ourselves .
you got downtown pretty fast. well , with an opportunity like this ,
one needs to take advantage. mmm .
how long do you think ill your dad and sister will be back ?
uh , anywhere from an hour to 20 minutes ?
well , 20 minutes is plenty .
it &apos;s kind of bright in here , don &apos;t you think ?
uh , maybe get someblinds or a ... a clapper .
mm , how about next time ?
hey , dan. hungry ?
hello .
hi . hi .
hi. vanessa , right ?
good to see you .
good to see you .
and good to see you
seeing us seeing you .
excuse me .
you really need to start using that door .
which you &apos;re showing me to .
well , practice makes perfect .
leaving , out the door .
and we appreciate it .
sorry .
so do you think we should talk about it ?
you mean about about vanessa ?
no , you know what ? she &apos;s like family .
it feels comfortable , and so therefore , she often shows up without calling .
no , i @-@ i mean about what almost , maybe ,
might have just happened .
oh , you mean if vanessa hadn &apos;t entered ,
and we ...
or we could not talk about it .
dan , we &apos;re home .
we got breakfast .
hungry ?
spotted , bass drunk off his ass at the palace bar ,
drinking away his woes and investment capital .
nathaniel , your position in my esteem
has been replaced by your voice mail .
so ... bart didn &apos;t go for vicola ,
but truth is i bought the house out already for tonight ,
and it &apos;s not a par @-@ tay without my people or any people .
i &apos;ll see you there .
long night ?
alfonso made me an omelet .
i may have washed it down with a bellini or two .
you father didn &apos;t go for your business proposal .
come on.let me help you .
he was born poor .
i was born loaded.yeah.
but if the only way to impress him is if i started with nothing ,
then why doesn &apos;t he just take it all away ?
because he loves you .
no good parent likes to see his child go without .
i had the idea .
i did the work .
he tells me i can &apos;t be committed ,
and he &apos;s the onescrewing 25 year olds ...
when he &apos;s supposedly committed to you .
we &apos;re newly committed , as recent as last week .
i wonder why he was pawing some asian chick in his limo yesterday .
how could i be surprised , really ?
excuse me .
i &apos;m on my way .
uh , i &apos;m late for my blowout at arden &apos;s .
mom , please .
the drugs were dad &apos;s .
i mean , i guess he thought it &apos;d be easier on everyone
if i took the hit ,
but they were his .
i don &apos;t understand .
no , he promised me he &apos;d flush the coke ,
then i caught him buying more .
the lengths that you will go to to get out of trouble
mom , he has a problem .
i need your help , please .
you look down at the floor every time someone tries to tell you the truth .
just look at me .
mom .
i saw dad buying drugs yesterday .
he &apos;s been under a lot of pressure ,
and if you hadn &apos;t been so difficult lately ...
what ?
your latest rebellions have been very hard on your father , nate .
all this business with dartmouth ,
your issues with blair .
mom , dad needs your help .
not another word of this .
we have a celebratory dinner to get to .
please wear a tie .
see ...
you curl your fingers into a fist ,
and with simple thrust of force ,
you knock on the door .
hey , i didn &apos;t use the fire escape .
baby steps .
and what are you doing watching porn ?
it &apos;s not porn . it &apos;s art cinema .
oh , from what i saw earlier ,
you don &apos;t need to be doing research .
i can &apos;t talk about this with you .
i &apos;m curious , though , about the change in your attitude ,
because may i remind you ,
that in your pale , romantic , tortured days ,
you &apos;d wax on , and i quote , that ,
&quot; sex is meaningful , like art , and you don &apos;t rush art . &quot;
that was in , uh , 25 .
i was more idealistic then . i was much younger ,
and there wasn &apos;t an actual girl who wanted to have sex with me .
you &apos;re ...
going to lose your virginity .
ooh , can you ...
my friend dan .
please not turn my sex life into a country song ?
it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m sure serena knows what to do ,
what with her vast experiences
with boarding school professors ,
pamplonian bullfighters ,
best friends &apos; boyfriends ...
that &apos;s enough now . you can go.please.
but if it were me with you ...
i &apos;d want you to hide cedric ,
maybe get some candles
and replace the football sheets .
but ... take it or leave it .
thanks .
thanks for helping me out with the bracelet .
i didn &apos;t know a broken clasp could cost that much .
oh , it was my pleasure .
oh , wait . no , it wasn &apos;t .
game recognizes game , little j.
but you have to show more respect .
this is the last time i &apos;ve helped you .
next time you cross me , i won &apos;t be as forgiving .
don &apos;t worry . there won &apos;t be a next time .
good , &apos; cause i wanna tell you something ,
something nobody knows , not even serena .
you can keep a secret , right ?
of course .
nate is planning on giving me his family diamond .
it &apos;s the most incredible ring you &apos;ve ever seen .
uh , ring as in engagement ring ?
i remember the first time i ever saw him .
maybe we were just little kids ,
but i knew he &apos;s the one i wanna marry .
now it seems like he feels the same way , too .
why are you not happy for me ?
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s just been a really weird week .
um , there &apos;s this stuff with my parents and my family ,
so maybe i should just go .
no , maybe you should look at me in the eye
and tell me what you &apos;re hiding .
are you jealous ? of you and nate ?
do you like him ? what ? no .
do you think because you talked to him once in the hall
that you might have a shot ?
blair , it &apos;s nothing like that .
then tell me , what is it like ?
i don &apos;t want to hurt you .
how could you hurt me ?
yesterday wasn &apos;t the first time i talked to nate .
at the ball , he told me he wasn &apos;t over serena .
why would he tell you that ?
&apos;cause i was wearing her mask ,
and he thought i was her .
he kissed me .
that &apos;s enough .
blair , i @-@ i didn &apos;t want you to find out .
you &apos;re dismissed , jenny ...
for good .
you look beautiful tonight .
anything on your mind ?
no .
is there anything you wanna say ?
no .
the leg wrap that &apos;s interesting .
sexy , right ? and it increases stability .
sure . yeah , i can see that .
the hair grab , does that really work ?
oh , yeah . every time .
okay , so leg wrap to hair grab .
do ... hold on a second .
do--do i have to keep my shirt open and billowing like that ?
well , it never hurts .
nice .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m doomed .
&quot; sensuous massage . &quot; something we should talk about ?
oh , uh , no .
you know , i have a lot of-- a lot of tension ,
stress in between my , um , shoulder blades .
so ...
i &apos;m headed to the gallery
to , uh , test run a 24 @-@ hour projection installation .
vanessa and jenny are over there . do you want to come ?
um , 24 hours is a very long time to be working straight .
so i think i might just chill here .
alone ?
on a saturday night ?
with your new girlfriend ?
son ...
dad , we &apos;ve had the talk already .
do you need a refresher ?
etched in my brain . thanks .
well , just be safe .
don &apos;t do anything you &apos;re not ready to do--or she &apos;s not .
oh , and , uh , lose the football sheets ...
and cedric .
well , you look pretty good for a dead messenger .
i thought i was doing the right thing .
you did.now blair knows the truth ,
and she and nate can talk about it .
honest communication is what every good relationship is based on ,
at least , that &apos;s what i hear .
i just--i think how i &apos;d feel , you know ,
if i loved someone , and they betrayed me .
how would you ever get things back to the way they were ?
wait , are we still talking about blair and nate here ?
yeah , of course.what else can we be talking about ?
i don &apos;t know . your parents ?
look , maybe you don &apos;t go back , maybe you go forward .
get two people in a room willing to be balls @-@ out honest ?
it might get ugly , but eventually ,
the dust has to settle ,
and then you can see if there &apos;s hope .
we &apos;ve celebrated the partnership ,
but i don &apos;t think we &apos;ve given eleanor her just due .
this lady is fantastic .
oh , well , uh , thank you , howard .
more cheese ?
have you tried the humboldt fog ? it &apos;s quite good .
eleanor &apos;s right . enough business talk .
right.let &apos;s focus on our families &apos;other joint venture
the union of our children .
i have to say , every time i look at anne &apos;s finger
and see blair &apos;s future engagement ring ...
i can hardly contain my joy .
blair , why don &apos;t you try it on ?
no , thank you.it &apos;s all right .
yes , i would like to see it.anne , give it to blair .
dad , she doesn &apos;t want to try on the ring .
howard , why don &apos;t we just let it alone ?
just give it to the girl , anne .
eleanor , do we have another bottle ?
if there was ever an occasion for the toast , this is it .
they &apos;re gonna make such a beautiful couple .
now come on.slide that thing on .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about , huh ?
oh , it &apos;s very pretty .
it looks magnificent
thank you
everybody , yeah ? yeah ?
it &apos;s perfect on her.oh , now how about that toast ? come on .
everybody ,
bottoms up .
dad , why don &apos;t we go smoke the cigars we got , huh ? good idea .
excuse us . certainly .
this seat taken ? father .
the light of day doesn &apos;t do this place any justice .
i told him he had to check it out
when the joint was in full swing .
chuck , this is pauletta cho .
chuck bass . pleasure .
all mine .
pauletta interviewed me for that recent piece in &quot; the observer , &quot;
roped me into a lunch yesterday
to pitch me on the idea of helping her with a career change .
what can i say ?
i &apos;m tired of reporting on titans .
i wanna be one myself .
right . well , uh , who better to help than my father ?
as a test , i gave her your proposal
that i was given to take a look at .
the math was fine ,
but what interested me was the wish fulfillment quality to the report .
so perhaps , some , uh ,
old @-@ school thinking and fatherly bias clouded my judgment .
what do you say ?
i love the idea of being a patron of burgeoning talent .
shall we take a full tour ?
you know , i &apos;ve been trying to get ahold of lily ,
but , uh , i don &apos;t seem able to .
uh , dad .
there &apos;s something i have to tell you .
dad , you have a problem.i don &apos;t have a problem .
you &apos;re tweaked and embarrassing .
you &apos;re trying to tell me you don &apos;t have a problem ?
don &apos;t be so dramatic .
no , you reminded me every day
how important this business deal is to you .
i mean , you &apos;ve been selling me out trying to make it happen ,
pushing me towards dartmouth , towards blair .
you don &apos;t understand .
dad , you &apos;re totally sabotaging all of it tonight .
hey , who the hell are you to tell me ?
i &apos;m the adult . you &apos;re the kid .
i know .
i &apos;m going back inside .
dad , don &apos;t .
nate , let go of me .
what &apos;s going on here ?
nothing.he &apos;s my son .
is everything all right ?
i said everything &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m not asking you .
sorry , dad . you need help .
check his pockets while you &apos;re at it .
all right , sir , just relax .
my father went home sick .
spotted on 5th avenue a father and son showdown .
too bad not all the witnesses can be bought off .
she &apos;s not taking my calls .
i can &apos;t believe you did this .
i made a mistake .
this isn &apos;t high school , chuck .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll take you back once you explain .
i &apos;m not so certain about that .
if she doesn &apos;t , i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s my fault .
there &apos;s a reason she was so quick to believe me .
there &apos;s a fire @-@ eater in the ladies lounge .
you two should set a meeting ,
see if this place can really be something .
i &apos;m gonna try and find lily and fix this .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m going to victrola .
i promised chuck . it &apos;s important to him .
i saw your father get arrested .
why didn &apos;t you come to me ?
i would &apos;ve listened .
i &apos;ve tried , blair .
but every time i try , something &apos;s got your attention
a dinner party , you know , a masked ball .
yeah , let &apos;s talk about that masked ball .
let &apos;s talk about how while i was waiting for you to find me
so that we could finally be together ,
you were confessing your feelings and kissing serena .
i thought i was doing everything right .
it &apos;s not your fault .
do you love me ?
you should deal with your father .
he needs you .
you know what ?
i don &apos;t .
okay , i &apos;m ready .
may i ?
i know it may not compare to , uh ,
a suite at the ritz in paris or a chalet in aspen ,
and it might be a fire hazard , but ...
it &apos;s perfect .
where &apos;s nate ?
i think we just broke up.what ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
i just want to escape .
that &apos;s what this place is for , right ?
i know you don &apos;t want to talk about what happened , but
relief.i feel relief .
you know , i got moves .
really ? then why don &apos;t you get up there ?
no , i &apos;m just saying , i have moves .
come on , you &apos;re ten times hotter than any of those girls .
i know what you &apos;re doing , bass .
you really don &apos;t think i &apos;d go up there .
i know you won &apos;t do it .
guard my drink .
who &apos;s that girl ?
i have no idea .
you go , baby vamp .
as you might have guessed , upper east siders ,
prohibition never stood a chance against exhibition .
it &apos;s human nature to be free .
and no matter how long you try to be good ,
you can &apos;t keep a bad girl down .
well , this is a new strain of obsessive @-@ compulsive .
the , uh , art piece projects up to the ceiling .
oh , still doing anything to get a girl on her back , huh ?
what are you doing here , lil ?
let me ask you that question another way .
did you break up with bart again ?
well , what did i do to deserve such a thorny welcome ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m really not in the mood to play games .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening with my wife or my marriage ,
and you showing up here randomly
and often doesn &apos;t make figuring that out any easier .
i &apos;m sorry i bothered you , really .
lil , wait .
you know , if you wanna stay and see the ,
uh , installation , i could really use the company .
oh , i don &apos;t want to be in your way .
since when , van der woodsen ?
i &apos;ve been meaning to get that fixed .
i &apos;m really happy to be here with you right now .
wait .
what ? what , did i do something wrong ?
no.i knew the hair thing was too much .
no .
no , it &apos;s just , um ...
um , &quot; um &quot; is never good . what ?
i ... i &apos;m scared .
of me ?
no .
well , yes , but ...
no , it &apos;s just i &apos;ve never , um ...
you &apos;ve--you &apos;ve never-- you &apos;re not ...
no.all right .
