this is my office ?
yes .
you have a $ 10,000 stipend to decorate ,
and there is an art loan program for equity partners .
here are your keys .
and welcome .
thank you .
uh , we &apos;ll have this , uh , cleared out soon ,
but , uh ...
this should be good in the meantime .
you are highly valued here , cary .
good to hear .
please keep this between us , but there is a good chance
we will lose a partner in the next six months .
which partner ?
well , i can &apos;t say , unfortunately , but ...
i would like to see you join our ranks .
before she became a partner ,
alicia made herself valuable by interviewing
and hiring a new associate .
we would like you to do the same .
these are resumes .
please look them over and just keep us posted .
i need to hire you .
okay .
what are you working on at the moment ?
employee background checks .
pass that off to the new investigator .
i need you to do a background check on a partner .
who ?
me .
give me a minute , please .
no calls .
peter florrick has offered me
the vacated illinois supreme court seat
if he wins the governorship .
i know there are always attempts
to smear a potential judge ,
so i want to know where i &apos;m vulnerable .
congratulations .
thank you .
hi . where are you , and what are you on ?
what am i on ?
what case ?
oh , uh , sweeney . why ?
okay , i need you take over my employee background checks .
i &apos;m innocent .
yes , you &apos;ve said .
but you don &apos;t believe me .
i think you like that i don &apos;t believe you .
i think you like that i represent you
even when i know you &apos;re guilty .
i like a lot of things about you , mrs. florrick .
i must have had issues as a child .
you feed my mary poppins obsession .
here &apos;s the thing , mr. sweeney .
i think you threw a birthday party that got out of hand
and ended up costing the hirschorn club $ 80,000 in damage .
that &apos;s all . i think that the prosecution is overreacting .
and i hate to disappoint you ,
but i think you &apos;re innocent .
you &apos;re right , it &apos;s not as much fun when you believe me .
i thought so .
ah , isobel .
you know alicia .
yes , i do .
she questioned me in court a year ago .
oh , yes-- when we were all on opposite sides .
my , how the wheel turns .
&quot; mutability is our tragedy , but it &apos;s also our hope &quot; &quot;
他说 : 我相信历史就是一个车轮
oh , i love it when he talks like that .
alicia . hello .
laura , hi . good to see you .
uh , first @-@ name basis ?
should i be jealous ?
what , that i like her more than i like you ?
sure .
prosecution has been dragging its feet on discovery !
... all evidence currently .
the state needs more time ,
your honor .
it has been six months
since mr. sweeney has been accused of disorderly conduct ,
your honor-- a class c misdemeanor .
no , he fired a gun at this party !
and given the fact that it was a private club that served alcohol ,
that &apos;s a class 4 felony .
okay , i get it .
i get it . we &apos;re both angry .
and we like to express our anger in loud voices .
but , see , here &apos;s the thing :
i &apos;m a judge .
i &apos;m unfazed by loud voices .
so here &apos;s the long and the short of it .
you plead this out !
get it out of my court !
this was a party that got out of hand , madam asa .
no one died , and as far as i can tell ,
no one even got hurt !
no one did .
oh , mr. sweeney , please know that
you can only hurt your cause by opening your friggin &apos; mouth .
okay , you two , come on , get up here .
court @-@ mandated bargaining . come on .
we want to plead this out , your honor ,
but ms. hellinger ...
shut up .
nobody talks until i ask .
now , what will you take , counselor ?
exoneration-- my client didn &apos;t do it .
your client is a psychopath who &apos;s lucky
he didn &apos;t get convicted for killing his wife .
and what will you take ?
six years , the maximum .
one year , two years probation .
no , your honor . two years probation .
good . compromise .
see ? there we go .
no . six years , the maximum .
we &apos;re not bending .
it &apos;s been six months , and they &apos;re still not bargaining ?
they still insist it &apos;s a class 4 .
it &apos;s about the election .
state &apos;s attorney doesn &apos;t want to bargain
with mr. sweeney and look weak on crime .
really ?
your husband doesn &apos;t like me ?
wait out the prosecution .
in one month , the gubernatorial race will be over ,
and i bet they let mr. sweeney go
with two months &apos; probation .
good . we delay .
that &apos;s always best .
well , then let &apos;s turn to
your business holdings , mr. sweeney .
alicia , cary , thank you .
oh . ms. swift , hello .
i &apos;m supposed to be in the ladies &apos; room .
just down the hall .
colin fires lawyers once a week .
but he &apos;s kept you on .
you &apos;re probably the most successful relationship in his life .
i wouldn &apos;t call it a relationship .
he talks about you .
don &apos;t you want to know how he talks about you ?
no , actually , i don &apos;t .
not sexually . well ...
not all the time sexually .
you are pristine to him .
he asked me if i found you desirable ,
but i find everyone desirable .
he asked me to marry him .
i &apos;m not sure i will .
oh , i like him enough .
he &apos;s rich .
but the question is ,
if i marry him , will he kill me ?
as his lawyer , i can &apos;t
speak to the rumors that he killed his first wife .
but i do know the supposed reason for the killing
was his wife &apos;s money .
and ... you have no money , to speak of .
so ... there would be no reason to kill you .
your hair would look prettier shorter .
your first interview is here .
you want a rundown ?
yeah .
have a seat on my lovely couch .
gregory steck--
he graduated from harvard law school in 2006 .
you can just say harvard .
graduated from harvard in 2006 .
currently clerks for judge wallace .
illinois supreme court justice wallace ?
yes , illinois supreme court justice .
uh , his facebook page was scrubbed clean .
nothing too dramatic .
okay . and here he is .
he &apos;s expecting $ 150,000 a year .
other firms are pursuing .
no , no , no . stay .
m @-@ me stay ?
yeah , yeah , yeah . look better with two .
should i say something ?
no . don &apos;t smile . look severe .
greg , how are you ? cary agos .
cary , good to meet you .
thanks for your interest .
and this is robyn burdine , one of our top lawyers .
i built my own canoe .
you built your own canoe ?
is that a metaphor ?
no , no . when i was home over christmas ,
i actually built one .
and i realized i like to get my fingernails dirty .
you know , like last night ,
i was writing wallace &apos;s majority opinion on miles ,
and i thought , what am i doing ?
you know , if i die today ,
no one will know i did anything .
you clerk for a supreme court justice long enough ,
you want to see the law in action .
well , robyn can tell you--
most associates never see
the inside of a courtroom for a few years .
oh , well , that won &apos;t bother me .
i &apos;ve been wallace &apos;s go @-@ to on draft opinions long enough .
i &apos;ve done his last four .
i need new fields , new streams .
do i know you from harvard or someplace ?
no . robyn &apos;s from georgetown .
oh , georgetown . really ? how &apos;d you like it ?
humid .
so , what &apos;d you think ?
he is a braggart .
is that a bad thing ?
i don &apos;t know , do you want a braggart ?
if he &apos;s got something to brag about , sure .
well , people who have something to brag about usually don &apos;t brag .
hello .
i &apos;m awake .
the interview today with steck--
what did he say about an opinion he was working on ?
&quot; i was writing wallace &apos;s majority opinion on miles ... &quot;
he said &quot; miles , &quot; didn &apos;t he ?
yeah . why ?
i think i know why
they won &apos;t plead on sweeney .
and it has nothing to do with the election .
hey .
hello .
sorry . i &apos;m cary agos
from your mom &apos;s work , and i just ...
cary argus is here .
he &apos;s from your work .
who ?
the people v. miles decision
will affect sweeney &apos;s sentencing .
that &apos;s why the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office won &apos;t bargain--
it &apos;s a delaying tactic .
how do you know ?
an interview today .
someone who clerks for wallace , the conservative justice ;
he finished writing the majority opinion .
that would make the gun @-@ firing his third strike .
yeah . sweeney &apos;s already been convicted
of two other major felonies .
double enhancement means
not only would sweeney &apos;s firing of the gun
be bumped up to a felony ,
but it would count as his third strike .
he would get life in prison .
that &apos;s right . no judicial discretion--
sweeney loses the case ,
he goes to prison for life .
oh , my god .
from a possible misdemeanor to life in prison .
another thing .
you were at sweeney &apos;s arraignment ,
weren &apos;t you ?
yes .
and you automatically asked for a speedy trial , right ?
yes , by rote .
uh ... are we past 160 days ?
no .
tomorrow .
we &apos;re not ready to go to trial .
i know .
but the prosecution isn &apos;t either .
they were thinking of slow @-@ playing this
until the supreme court opinion came down .
so we would have to rush this .
yeah .
you have to conduct a defense
and get it to deliberations
before the supreme court opinion comes down .
or sweeney faces life in prison .
that &apos;s right .
we have to run the fastest trial in history .
excuse me ?
we want to exercise mr. sweeney &apos;s right to a speedy trial .
your honor , i ... we &apos;re not ready .
you want a speedy trial now ?
well , we wanted a speedy trial 159 days ago
at mr. sweeney &apos;s arraignment when we requested it ,
as you can see here from the arraignment transcript .
your honor , this is ...
every defense attorney insists on that by rote .
yes , but we meant it . and we still do .
are you ready to go to trial , mrs. florrick ?
we are , your honor .
asa hellinger ?
we &apos;re absolutely not .
that really doesn &apos;t matter ,
your honor , given that the speedy trial statute
imposes a 160 @-@ day time limit .
the prosecution must go to trial today
or release our client .
quiet down .
we have an unusual situation here .
we have court in two and a half hours ,
and we were preparing for court in four months .
so we &apos;ll need all hands on deck .
do we have a ballistics expert ?
not yet . we were planning
to find out who the prosecution hired .
who do we know is free ?
who &apos;s the best ?
well , kurt mcveigh is the best .
i think he &apos;s working on a case .
maybe someone could call him and see
if he &apos;d make himself available .
am i missing something here ?
no . i &apos;ll try him .
good . cary , robyn ,
see if you can get more information
on when the opinion will be published .
we &apos;ll try .
and i want one of the partners on this .
alicia is a partner .
no , one of the name partners .
my apologies , mrs. florrick ,
but i want the biggest guns .
ah , good . will is free .
you take the sweeney case . i can &apos;t .
why not ?
you &apos;re the litigator .
i &apos;m ... involved .
with whom ? judge politi ?
the asa , laura hellinger .
you &apos;re kidding ? you &apos;re dating her ?
i ... for a week .
diane ?
uh , i have something for you .
oh , uh , one second .
just get a sign @-@ off from sweeney ,
and we &apos;re protected on malpractice .
maybe it &apos;s good .
hi . mr. sweeney , could i speak to you for a minute ?
out here .
certainly .
are we confessing ?
no , no .
you &apos;ve asked for a partner to second chair your case .
i feel obligated to warn you that
i &apos;m in a relationship with the prosecutor in your case .
a sexual relationship ?
i &apos;d rather not go into detail .
yes , i know . you &apos;d rather not .
but i &apos;m your client ,
and i bring 22 million a year into your firm .
and before i sign off , i want to know .
is it a sexual relatiohihip ?
not currently .
but you intend it to be ?
mr. sweeney , it is your prerogative
to insist on another lawyer . i ...
that &apos;s why i love this place .
everybody sleeps with everybody else .
come on .
yes , i sign off .
as long as i get details .
all right , so we invite him back .
for a callback interview ?
yeah , and to fish around for the release date of the opinion .
he &apos;s a braggart .
maybe he &apos;ll brag about when it &apos;s being published .
um , so , you ... you found something ?
yeah .
look , i &apos;ll only tell you as much as you want to know ,
so , at any moment , you can say , &quot; stop . &quot;
&quot; elena knew it was wrong to want damon .
&quot; she was about to marry stefan , after all .
&quot; yet when damon drew her close ,
&quot; elena found herself unable to resist his vampire charms .
&quot; when damon &apos;s fangs dug into her neck ,
&quot; her whole body pulsed with desire .
&quot; she needed him .
&quot; she needed him bad . &quot;
i ... huh ?
it &apos;s fan fiction for the tv show vampire diaries .
so ? i ...
you wrote it .
you ... i wrote what ? that ?
yeah .
kalinda , i &apos;ve never even heard of the tv show vampire diaries .
and if i had , i wouldn &apos;t feel compelled to write something like ...
does it go on like that ?
it does .
elena and damon have sex in the end in a pickup truck .
i &apos;m happy for them .
it came from your ip address ,
and your e @-@ mail account .
kalinda , i ... i don &apos;t know what to say .
who else has access to your computer ?
no one . no ...
oh .
who ?
my housekeeper .
okay . what &apos;s her name ?
i &apos;ll talk to her .
diane , i don &apos;t think you understand .
you have to fire her , and i do need her name .
no . she is a nice lady with three kids .
i mean , she just , obviously ,
doesn &apos;t have any sense of boundaries .
no . you need to create
a paper trail to separate yourself from her .
you &apos;re wanting to become
an illinois supreme court justice , diane .
if your name becomes associated with vampire fan fiction ,
the ridicule factor &apos;s going to be hard to beat .
you need to fire her .
you shot that , mr. catalini ?
uh , it &apos;s catalani .
yeah , the video ?
yeah , i shot that on my cell phone .
i thought the party was getting out of hand .
and you ... i ...
just to be clear , you &apos;re wearing those gym clothes
because you came straight from the gym ?
yeah , i got your call ,
and , um , i was on the treadmill .
i was watching the news , uh , you know ,
up there above the treadmill , and , um , and i got your call ...
okay , i think we &apos;ve established the reason
for the witness &apos;s clothes .
can we move on ?
yes . okay , so ...
str ... uh ... strike that , and , uh ...
sorry , your honor .
i usually have more time to prepare .
i sympathize .
we &apos;re all actors without a script .
so , mr. catalini-- catalani ,
uh , you saw mr. sweeney , the defendant over there ,
with a gun-- this gun ...
right ?
yeah , that &apos;s it . it &apos;s supposed to be capone &apos;s gun ,
and sweeney wanted to play william tell .
he was talking about how some author
did the same thing with his wife .
william burroughs .
shut up .
ah , thank you , mr. sweeney .
mr. sweeney wanted to use this gun
to shoot an apple off his girlfriend &apos;s head ?
someone &apos;s head , yeah .
nothing further .
do you hold a grudge , mr. catalani ?
no .
did mr. sweeney fire you ?
no . um , there was a general downsizing ,
but , no , i wasn &apos;t fired .
was the ... the downsizing at the behest of mr. sweeney ?
yeah , i guess .
nothing further , your honor .
we &apos;re ready for the next witness .
oh , unfortunately , we &apos;re not .
our ballistics expert is stuck in salt lake city ...
your honor , the defense is ready .
we can &apos;t help ms. hellinger &apos;s problems .
yes , well , you can present him as a rebuttal witness
when he arrives , ms. hellinger .
please proceed .
as you can see , the bullet entered the body ,
and left what we call a tail splash .
now , this is basically the hurling
of injured tissue behind .
the bullet moves through the body and creates a ...
the bullet ...
the bullet moving through the body ...
you can see here the bullet as it ...
as ... i &apos;m sorry .
uh , what was the question again ?
thank you .
you were wonderful .
i was not wonderful . i was ... distracted .
you were wonderfully distracted .
sorry about mr. romney .
i almost called you on election night .
to gloat ?
no , to sympathize .
i know how it feels .
kerry in 2004 .
are we really comparing kerry to romney ?
i need your help .
with ?
a case .
an innocent man .
who ?
just give this a chance .
colin sweeney .
kurt , just look at this .
even guilty people can be innocent sometimes .
just do it for me , please ?
alicia .
laura , i &apos;m sorry about how crazy the trial got .
we just had ...
can i ask you ...
do you have a relationship with will ?
what ?
are you two romantically involved ?
no .
we &apos;re not involved .
we were ,
once , but it was a long time ago .
it &apos;s not still going on ?
no , it &apos;s over , i swear .
laura , you &apos;re my friend .
so is will , and i think it &apos;s great that you two are ...
whatever you are .
okay .
we &apos;re late .
so , your testimony ,
ms. swift , is that mr. sweeney
could not have been firing this gun ,
because at that point , he was with you ?
yes , in the rose salon .
and that &apos;s here ?
uh , sorry , your honor .
we didn &apos;t have time to put it on a slide .
that &apos;s all right . just plop it up here on the bench .
yeah , that &apos;s the rose salon right there off the main lounge .
mm @-@ hmm , and what were you doing there ?
anal .
well , i think that &apos;s clear .
no further questions .
so you were having ...
you ... anal intercourse
with mr. sweeney at the time of the gunshot ?
yes , that is correct , ma &apos;am .
and you &apos;re mr. sweeney &apos;s live @-@ in girlfriend ,
is that right , ms. swift ?
yes , i am .
so , why shouldn &apos;t this court dismiss your testimony
as biased ?
because i &apos;m not .
but don &apos;t you intend to marry him ?
i &apos;m not so sure about that .
i have my concerns .
oh , really ?
what might those be ?
well , he killed his first wife .
ms. hellinger , any more questions ?
i guess not .
i think your girlfriend &apos;s gonna need some makeup sex
i won &apos;t say i was surprised to get the call , it &apos;s just ...
well , it &apos;s good to be asked back .
oh , i felt like we just
scratched the surface of greg steck .
ro ... robyn and i-- we @-@ we looked at each other
after our interview , and ... and we realized
we hadn &apos;t asked you anything
about your duties at the supreme court .
oh , well , you have another three hours ?
we might .
so you &apos;ve been writing up
all of wallace &apos;s opinions ?
oh , pretty much . i mean , you know how it is .
judges do none of the work , get all the glory .
and the , uh ...
the @-@ the ...
the miles opinion--
did the justice give you notes on that ?
no , no .
he &apos;s been taking it out on his , uh ...
i &apos;m sorry .
this might be my mom ; she &apos;s in the hospital .
sorry , cary ,
robyn .
that was hockney &amp; barnes .
they just hired me .
wait . what ?
yeah , i told them to get back to me by 3 : 00 p.m.
that was them . thanks for your interest .
wait . we may want to hire you .
okay .
uh , i &apos;ll check with my friends in springfield ,
see if they know anything about miles .
no , i &apos;ll go after him .
it won &apos;t make a difference . he got a job .
i won &apos;t go after him about a job .
okay , this is the prosecution &apos;s ballistics re @-@ creation .
that &apos;s the spot where they recovered the bullet .
and here , their experts say that
they can prove that the bullet was fired
from the doorway to this room .
the rose salon .
that &apos;s where we proved sweeney was having sex . damn it .
so , we rebut the expert .
that &apos;s our only option .
kurt ?
yeah ?
we only have a few hours to rebut their testimony .
kurt , where are you going ?
out .
where ?
to rebut their testimony .
there was some debate whether to spackle it over ,
or wear it as a badge of honor .
as you might expect , inertia took over .
thank you , mr. creed .
do you want me to hold that light for you ?
it &apos;ll take as long as it takes .
no , i didn &apos;t say anything .
so ... obamacare .
i &apos;m just joking .
sorry , something about you makes me want to tease you .
what is that ?
a laser .
so , are you still with your protege ?
my ...
protege . miranda .
last time i saw you , she was spreading
her fox news pixie dust all over you .
she &apos;s heading up the san diego crime lab .
oh , how nice for her .
very warm there .
like baywatch pd .
am i bothering you ?
no . no , this is entertaining . please .
what room is that ?
the rose salon .
isn &apos;t that bad ?
yes .
is it still bad ?
yes .
well , you &apos;ll tell me when it becomes good ?
you heading back to the country tonight ?
no .
you at the edgewater ?
yeah , why ?
no reason .
dinner ?
yes . good .
what is this ?
where the bullet came from .
it &apos;s called the rainbow effect .
to determine where a shooter stood ,
you need to calculate the bullet &apos;s trajectory .
and the arch of a bullet can look like a rainbow .
and do bullets create different types of ... rainbows ?
yes , guns do .
in this case , you have a 1929 pistol
firing a 38 @-@ caliber lead bullet
made circa 1930 .
and is the fact that it was made in 1930 important ?
yes . old ammunition doesn &apos;t have as much power ,
which means that gravity pulls it down faster .
modern bullets are typically copper @-@ jacketed
so they shoot flatter .
so , in your expert opinion ,
is the prosecution re @-@ creation accurate ?
no . based on my calculations ,
the bullet was fired not from outside the rose salon ,
but from here .
and that would be the camelia room ?
yes .
thank you , mr. mcveigh .
more skeletons in my closet ?
one or two .
let &apos;s , uh ... start the dentist &apos;s drill .
do you know the name jacob greenberg ?
no .
he used to work with your father .
oh , jake greenburg . yes .
they taught together at law school .
yeah , until greenburg was brought before the house committee
on un @-@ american activities .
i ... i know .
he was accused of being a communist sympathizer .
he lost his job and committed suicide .
yes .
i @-@ i &apos;m not sure , um ...
i mean , what is this , kalinda ?
my father was jake &apos;s best friend .
he stood by him .
in fact , he ...
he was one of the only people who stood by him .
at great personal expense .
i know .
so , i ...
i don &apos;t know what you think .
diane , you don &apos;t have to hear this .
well , will it affect the judgeship ?
i don &apos;t know .
it might .
well , then ... yes .
i mean , tell me .
private meetings were held between house committee
on un @-@ american activities and several ...
influential professors .
and they met with my father ?
yes .
a @-@ and you &apos;re saying that ...
that he named jake ?
but that &apos;s a rumor , right ?
i mean , it was-- there were private meetings ,
so there was no ...
minutes were taken .
no ... yes .
i ... i think we should stop .
thank you , kalinda .
i just , um ...
i need to ...
don &apos;t stop investigating , please .
okay .
we recall isobel swift .
you testified that you and mr. sweeney were
having sex at the moment he allegedly fired the gun .
yes .
would you say the sex was ...
pretty wild ?
well ... yes .
and this sexual activity took place in the rose salon ?
actually , i believe i was mistaken when i said that .
upon further reflection ,
i remembered we were actually in the camelia room .
objection , your honor .
asked and answered .
the witness is entitled to change
her testimony if her recollection
of the events in question changes .
she &apos;s badgering the witness , your honor .
she doesn &apos;t look badgered to me . overruled .
so , ms. swift , just to be clear ,
you &apos;re absolutely positive that the two of you
were in the camelia room ,
the very room from which the gun was fired ,
according to the defense &apos;s own expert ?
yes .
you were not .
i was .
six months in juvie .
it was involuntary manslaughter .
i shot my own brother .
oh , well , as long as that &apos;s all it was .
it was an accident , of course .
and it was my dad &apos;s huntin &apos; rifle .
how was i supposed to know it was loaded ?
but ... judge didn &apos;t care .
you can look it up in the ohio department of corrections .
say hello to j479361 .
wow . a felon .
so , mr. fancy supreme court clerk .
what &apos;s it like helping shape the law ?
the truth ?
intoxicating .
i mean , the breadth of power those nine people have .
the miles opinion sure could
make things harder for criminals with guns .
it &apos;s going to . soon .
really ? you sound like you know what you &apos;re talking about .
wallace sent over his revisions for me
to check out-- not that he changed much .
can i read it ?
i &apos;d love to , but that &apos;s against the rules .
you can read it in ...
40 hours .
that &apos;s what he said .
pizza ?
go ahead .
you know , he really wasn &apos;t such a bad guy .
he was kind of sensitive .
he was talking about jackson pollack .
you know jackson pollack ?
you didn &apos;t drive here , did you ?
alicia , it &apos;s cary .
people v. miles is coming down in 40 hours .
give me a call when you pick this up .
i did not drive ; i jogged .
you don &apos;t like jackson pollack ?
he was in a car accident .
yes , i know .
you &apos;re really smart .
let me take you home .
no .
come on . time to go home .
i want more pizza .
okay .
what time is it , anyway ?
i idolized my father .
people are always more than one thing , diane .
maybe .
but if he was a hypocrite ,
what does that make me ?
i patterned my life after his .
you patterned your life after the things
that you admired about him .
you don &apos;t need to answer for ...
sins you didn &apos;t even know about .
you &apos;re good at this .
why do we keep running away from each other ?
i don &apos;t know .
we should get married .
did i just say that ?
you did .
okay , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m in a transitional place right now ,
and i ...
i think i &apos;m just saying things .
okay .
okay .
well , now i &apos;m embarrassed .
forget i just said that .
you &apos;re sure ?
our intetelligence is pretty good .
the supreme court will announce their decision tomorrow .
so ... where does that leave me ?
we have to wrap this case up today .
in other words , i &apos;m screwed .
isobel hurt us in court yesterday .
there is still time to turn her around ,
but to do that ,
i need to know what &apos;s going on .
you flatter me , mrs. florrick .
you assume that , like you , i know and understand
the person i &apos;m romantically involved with , but ...
unfortunately , i &apos;m not you .
get down ! get down !
uh , so , this is how this should work .
you come to me saying ,
&quot; i discovered i was wrong about your father ,
and there &apos;s something on this computer that will prove that . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry
no . let &apos;s do it .
we looked at christmas past ,
we looked at christmas present ;
now for christmas yet to come .
just let me know when you want me to stop it .
there &apos;s a reason that those first ten amendments were passed .
the founding fathers
had first hand experience with tyranny .
and i find it curious that mr. obama thinks himself
wiser than thomas jefferson or james madison
when it comes to my right to bear arms .
now , is it enough for me to want to secede from the union ?
i don &apos;t know .
and @-@ and i hope i never have to find out .
but i would not stand in the way of others who wanted to do so ,
that much i do know .
would it be too ironic to ask you to shoot me ?
look , the problem is not with the court .
the problem is with the campaign .
the secession talk .
yes .
whatever your relationship is with mcveigh ,
i would advise that you put it on hold
until you &apos;ve been appointed .
six months .
i know you have concerns about mr. sweeney &apos;s history ,
but if your testimony ...
his history ?
the other day .
you said you had concerns .
oh , that .
i was kidding .
i &apos;m not worried about that .
i have every intention of being mrs. colin sweeney .
then ...
i don &apos;t want a prenup .
colin &apos;s insisting on one .
so that &apos;s why ...
i lied in court , yeah .
tell him to forget the prenup , and i &apos;ll be good .
you know , i think i was wrong about your hair .
it looks good .
thanks .
greg .
what are you doing here ?
well , i couldn &apos;t get you to return my texts ,
so i thought i &apos;d try you in person .
bad hangover .
yeah . mine &apos;s pretty bad , too .
look , i know what you were after last night .
what do you mean ? i was after a good time .
yeah . i saw the coverage of the sweeney case ,
and i looked you up , too , you never passed the bar .
sorry .
the miles opinion comes out today at 5 : 00 p.m.
the chief justice has a wedding in bermuda ,
and he wants the extra day .
so i &apos;d hurry .
thank you , greg .
you &apos;re welcome .
can i see you again ?
no . but ... thanks .
the lamp you &apos;re referring to was classic tiffany style .
the glass was shattered in the tumult .
but we had each individual pane
replaced in the original frame .
here is it .
that &apos;s the one .
see ?
the lamp was intact .
yeah . it got knocked over .
no , it was hit .
ricochet .
sir .
oh , uh , excuse me .
don &apos;t be embarrassed , diane .
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m not rejecting it .
rejecting what ?
marriage .
i just ...
need time to think .
point of ricochet .
meaning ?
as much as i hate to say it ,
your guy &apos;s still innocent .
i based part of my calculations on witness testimony ,
which of course is inherently unreliable ,
unlike physical evidence .
i ...
here , you can see that the lamp is still intact .
it was standing on the opposite side of the room
from the doorway into the camelia room .
the club thought it was broken in the melee at the party ,
which is why it was excluded from the crime scene evidence .
but it wasn &apos;t broken in the melee ?
no . it was shot at .
objection . foundation .
defense exhibit k , your honor .
it &apos;s an affidavit from the manager of the hirschorn club ,
verifying the provenance of the lamp .
mr. mcveigh , can you tell us ...
counselor ? excuse me .
i have to rule .
uh , yes , i &apos;m sorry , your honor .
overruled .
can you tell the court what that mark is on the lampshade ?
it &apos;s a nick , consistent with being hit by a bullet .
and does this change your original conclusion ?
yes , it means that the shooter also had to be standing
on the opposite side of the room from the camelia room doorway .
you mean , where the witness , michael catalani ,
testified he was standing ?
given the physics involved , yes .
excuse me , your honor . objection .
to ?
something two questions ago .
s @-@ speculation .
oh , okay . overruled .
nothing further , your honor .
and no more witnesses .
defense rests . we have our summation ready .
okay , sure . you &apos;re excused , mr. mcveigh .
go ahead , counselor .
we &apos;re ready for your summation .
the evidence proves that mr. colin sweeney
did not shoot the gun , your honor .
he &apos;s innocent .
good . i like this new way to conduct trials .
hi again .
hello .
dropping off your invoice ?
sorry .
it &apos;s been an odd series of days .
any word ?
no . judge politi &apos;s still deliberating .
i wish i could say &quot; good luck &quot; on that .
sweeney &apos;s a hard man to cheer for .
i think we should wait and think about marriage .
i don &apos;t know .
i worry we &apos;ll always be waiting .
maybe that &apos;s fine .
i &apos;ll talk to you .
wait .
i don &apos;t want to wait .
please .
i don &apos;t want to wait .
i don &apos;t .
and then what ?
so , i &apos;ve arrived at a decision .
and unfortunately , ms. hellinger ,
i find that there simply isn &apos;t enough evidence
to prove the gun charge against mr. sweeney .
accordingly , i must find him not guilty on this charge .
however , mr. sweeney ,
you &apos;re pretty much a scumbag .
i know i &apos;ll probably get censured for that ,
but i really don &apos;t care .
i do find you guilty of disorderly conduct ,
and i sentence you to a $ 1,500 fine ,
30 days incarceration to be served immediately .
we &apos;re done here .
thank god .
thank you . again .
you still have to serve 30 days .
i know , but , uh ...
at least i have something to look forward to on my release .
so , you decided no prenup ?
i love her too much .
she &apos;s going to cheat you .
i know . it &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll just kill her .
* once again , it &apos;s happening ... *
i &apos;ll wait for you .
i know , love .
can he have these ?
hold &apos; em for me .
* oh ... this love is unrequited *
* twice the pain the suffering *
* oh my love is unrequited *
* oh , my love is unrequited ... *
hello .
will , are you busy ?
um , no . what &apos;s up ?
nothing , um , just something with work .
what is going on ?
are you guys trying to save on electricity ?
i will call you back . i &apos;m fine .
* and get back what i gave my men *
* get back ... *
who was that , alicia ?
yeah .
* oh , the shame this crying game *
* oh , my love ... *
yes ?
i &apos;m not being honest .
you &apos;re not ?
no , and i should be .
there was a guy i dated in the military .
he &apos;s recently come back into my life .
i &apos;m sorry , but i ...
no , no . hey . no , i get it .
congratulations .
for ?
the case .
* oh , my love is unrequited *
