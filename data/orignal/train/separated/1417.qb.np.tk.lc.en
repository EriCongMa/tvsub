honeydew ! what &apos;s up ?
guess who &apos;s here .
your dad !
he drove his r.v. all the way up from cocoa beach .
hey , son , working hard ?
he &apos;s gonna say &quot; hardly working . &quot;
i meant to tell you he was driving out .
did he say it ?
oh , yeah .
good kid .
he wasn &apos;t supposed to show up for a few more days .
well , guess what he brought us .
a dog ... to keep .
yes ! yes .
yes , i should have told claire about the dog ,
and i was going to .
but i was just waiting for her to be in the right mood .
actually , i did get one right mood a couple nights ago ,
but i cashed that in for something else .
am i in trouble ?
oh , really , really big .
okay , i &apos;m a little scared . how bad is this ?
oh , well we have a new rule- no sleeping in the bedroom .
mr. pritchett . uh , ben- ben dugan .
i went to high school with mitch .
we were in the drama club together .
that &apos;s right .
yeah .
geez , i didn &apos;t recognize you
without that old @-@ guy makeup on .
you know , you and mitch knocked the sunshine boys out of the park .
mitch was really great in that .
i always thought he should be an actor .
yeah , he &apos;s got a real job now .
he &apos;s a lawyer . how about you ?
still acting .
fantastic .
actually , it &apos;s exciting . i &apos;m in a new movie ,
maple drive . just came out .
you &apos;re kidding me . look at me . i know somebody famous .
uh , anyway , i got to go .
great to see you .
good to see you too .
kid &apos;s a movie star .
hey , how &apos;d it go in there ?
no cavities .
and i got a free toothbrush .
hey , you want to go to the movies ?
i just heard about a good one .
but i &apos;m supposed to be in school .
well , you &apos;re supposed to floss too ,
but you got away with that one .
come on . let &apos;s go .
one of the greatest days of my life ...
was when my old man sprung me from school
and took me to the track .
i wanted to do the same type of thing for manny ,
plus i figured when gloria heard about it ,
maybe it pays off in the bedroom .
i wonder if that &apos;s why my old man did it .
oh , crap .
your mother @-@ in @-@ law just had to have the dog .
turns out she &apos;s allergic .
and the pet store didn &apos;t have a grace period
or a return policy or anything ?
i got him from the pound .
was there a twister in kansas ?
&apos;cause there &apos;s a house in my driveway .
welcome home , mr. dunphy .
uh , always a pleasure , mr. dunphy .
indeed it is , mr. dunphy . place it there .
oh , i shall . i shall .
i miss this . get in here .
my dad is awesome .
he &apos;s awesome . he &apos;s always up . he &apos;s always happy .
i mean , he and i are best buds .
we &apos;re like two peas in a pod .
or siamese twins . or a snake with two heads .
they &apos;ve actually been all those things for halloween .
yeah .
oy . this must be scout , huh ?
i should warn you . he sheds .
i made the mistake of letting him sleep with me on the road .
now my sheets look like two bigfoots did it .
pardon the language .
how &apos;s mom ?
speaking of big feet , eh ?
she &apos;s on a cruise with her girlfriends ,
some of which are not totally unattractive .
oh , that reminds me . she sent some gifts for the kids .
um , i will be right back .
you three get better acquainted .
will do !
bye !
will do !
i cannot believe you got a dog without consulting me .
this was a major family decision .
it was wrong .
yeah .
and i &apos;m sorry .
but we have talked about getting a dog for years ,
and you &apos;re the only one who wasn &apos;t into it .
because i knew that i would be the one taking care of it .
that &apos;s not true .
no , we will all help .
this is a great chance to teach the kids responsibility .
that is exactly what you said about luke &apos;s paper route .
第一季第二十一集
hello ?
is anyone in there ?
red &apos;s a good color on you .
it &apos;s just a movie .
oh , he &apos;s so cute .
look at his little face .
i always wanted a dog . thanks , grandpa .
okay , but remember , having a dog is a major responsibility .
everyone in the family has to pitch in .
can do , mrs. d.
not you , dylan .
oh , phew . &apos; cause i got a lot on my plate right now .
hey , look who &apos;s here . uncle cam .
hey , we heard about the new addition
and we had to come right over .
cameron , so good to see you again .
now that is a shirt .
oh , well , thank you , frank . i get &apos; em online .
i &apos;ll send you a link .
oh , well , at home , i smoke sausages .
i &apos;ll send you a link .
classic .
and this must be lily .
oh , yes .
she just couldn &apos;t wait to meet the new doggy .
i think she &apos;s good right here .
let me get in there and get some of that doggyness .
oh , there it is .
haley .
there it is .
i gotta go .
what &apos;s wrong ?
that was brian . he just quit the band .
what ? why ?
he &apos;s moving to portland .
his parents got back together .
oh , that sucks .
i know .
now we &apos;re gonna have to cancel the gig tomorrow .
maybe you can find another drummer .
no . i think it &apos;s too late for that now .
i play drums .
well , i mean , i haven &apos;t played in a while , since lily &apos;s come along ,
but if you &apos;re in a jam , i can jam .
well , i totally would , but i &apos;m not sure
we like the same sorts of music , you know ?
what , because i &apos;m gay ,
i &apos;m just gonna want to play show tunes ?
no , because you &apos;re old .
wow . that hurt more , dylan .
give him a chance . it &apos;s better than canceling .
you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t want to lose
the deposit on that fog machine .
okay . let &apos;s do it .
i used to be a music teacher ,
but i gave that up as soon as lily came along .
yes . well , we just felt that it was really important ...
that one of us stayed hometo raise her , so-
yeah , and that &apos;s not a judgmenton other people &apos;s choices .
it &apos;s just that we happen to be a very traditional family .
yes , that &apos;s what the disabled lesbian shaman
who blessed lily &apos;s room said too .
how you doin &apos; , buddy ?
all right , relax .
oh , geez .
i am telling you , phil , the man was crying .
that is impossible .
my dad is the happiest guy on earth .
it probably just sounded like he was crying .
have you heard the noise he makes when he gets out of a chair ?
no . i know what i heard .
i think this has something to do with your mom .
what ?
yeah , he came here alone . think about it .
she &apos;s on a cruise .
yeah , and they never take separate vacations , so-
no . no , if something was wrong ,
my dad would tell me about it .
no , phil , he wouldn &apos;t ,
because you guys never actually talk about anything .
we talk all the time .
he crank calls me at work , like , three times a week .
crank calls don &apos;t count .
counts for fun .
no , honestly , i think that you should
find out what &apos;s going on with your dad .
it &apos;s going to be nothing .
my dad isn &apos;t like your dad .
there &apos;s nothing deep and dark inside .
his hard candy shell is just hiding more candy .
i think he wants to go out . good boy .
smart dog .
i hate to break it to you ,
but i think all dogs can do that .
i &apos;m gonna play outside .
what happened ?
okay .
should i just play a little something ?
yeah . but , you know , if it doesn &apos;t work out ,
don &apos;t feel bad .
well , hopefully this is- this is like riding a bicycle ,
and it &apos;ll all come back to me .
that &apos;s the loud one .
so ... here we go .
oh , silly me .
i had the sticks in the wrong hands .
dude , you should label those sticks .
is that the alarm ? has our perimeter been breached ?
it &apos;s not the alarm . the doorbell won &apos;t stop ringing .
maybe a demon is ringing it .
not a demon .
who keeps ringing the doorbell ?
we &apos;re pretty sure it &apos;s a demon .
oh , yeah ?
there .
if it were a demon , it would keep on ringing .
not if he &apos;s already inside . i &apos;m getting a weapon .
what were you thinking ?
who takes a little boy to a horror movie ?
that &apos;s loco , jay .
this is no big deal . you want scary ?
when i was his age ,
i lived through the cuban missile crisis .
i slept with a butter knife under my pillow ...
in case i had to fight some soviet colonel .
why would they send a soviet colonel to get a little boy ?
because i could identify every commie plane .
what are we talking about ?
look , all i &apos;m saying , being scared is part of growing up .
manny will get over this . it builds character .
i &apos;ll take the first watch .
you two might as well get some rest .
it &apos;s gonna be a long night .
character .
dad ?
come on in ! it &apos;s open !
don &apos;t tell me . you need a cup of sugar .
nah . just , uh-
i was just wondering , i don &apos;t know , uh-
anything on the old noodle ?
other than a bad toupee ?
i &apos;m kidding , of course . this is my real hair .
well , okay .
wait a minute .
i want to ask you something .
am i putting you in a bad position with this whole dog thing ?
claire seemed a little put out .
oh , don &apos;t worry about it . claire didn &apos;t like me at first either .
i can &apos;t blame her . dismissed !
oh , dad , um , you know what ? i , uh-
claire saw something ,
and she &apos;d kill me if i- if i didn &apos;t ask .
what is it ?
would you wear pants to breakfast , for crying out loud ?
you got me again . right in the funny bone .
all right .
come on , scout . let go of it .
no , no , no !
dog . look at this .
how did he get ahold of your bra ?
well , uh , we were out on a date ,
and he has a really nice car , so-
how do you think ? he got it out of the laundry basket .
can &apos;t take my eyes off that dog for a second .
why don &apos;t you just keep him in the crate ?
i tried that . he figured out how to get out .
i thought you were dealing with your dad .
oh , yeah , i did . he &apos;s fine , so-
you got that from a two @-@ minute conversation ?
i ... asked him point @-@ blank if he was okay .
he said he was . so i just-
just swapped some jokes and moved on .
phil , the man needs more of a push than that .
look , if he wants to talk to me about it , he will .
geez , someone &apos;s panties are in a bunch .
i thought i was showing concern and-
no . right there .
oh , my god ! that damn dog !
guys , little help ?
i have to go to the bathroom , and i &apos;m not gonna do it in here .
hey , i got chinese .
sweet ! i &apos;m starving .
oh , we have guests .
yeah . we &apos;re just having a little jam session .
you know dylan . this is craig . this is neil .
i &apos;ll always remember him as the stranger holding my baby .
can i talk to you in the kitchen for a second ?
yeah . hey , guys , let &apos;s , uh- let &apos;s just take five .
what &apos;s up with 21 jump street ?
oh , well , their drummer quit
and i &apos;m gonna fill in for him tomorrow night .
no , no . we have pepper &apos;s
apres @-@ ski fondue party tomorrow night , cam .
oh , no .
so you &apos;ll just have to tell your band
that they &apos;re gonna have to find someone else .
you know what ? no . i &apos;m not gonna let these fellas down .
i made a commitment .
you made two commitments , okay ?
and you know how pepper is .
everything has to be perfect .
he gets mad if you don &apos;t wear a big sweater .
yeah , i remember . i got so hot last year ,
i almost went face down in the gruyere .
so i &apos;m going by myself , is that what you &apos;re saying ?
i just feel like i kind of need this .
to round out your college applications ?
it &apos;s just that because i &apos;m always home with lily ...
i just feel like i &apos;m going a little bit stir @-@ crazy .
look at the den .
every time i finish painting it , i start all over again .
it &apos;s like the golden gate bridge .
i &apos;m gonna go back to jamming .
yeah , we gotta fix this .
hey , what &apos;s with the big sweater at a concert ?
is that a gay thing ?
no , dad . it &apos;s for my friend pepper &apos;s apres @-@ ski fondue-
yeah . yeah , it &apos;s a gay thing .
hope they start soon .
i don &apos;t think scout likes to be left alone .
you love the dog .
no , i don &apos;t love the dog . i love my couch .
and the dog was looking at it like it was a giant sausage .
good news , you two . you &apos;re getting your driveway back .
i &apos;m hitting the open road in the morning .
oh , already ?
yeah .
anxious to get home and see mom , huh ?
no , i &apos;m just gonna drive wherever the wind blows me ,
which is usually into the next lane .
can we get some sodas , grandpa ?
okay , but just one . i &apos;m driving . come on .
he &apos;s not going home ? he &apos;s never been away from my mom
for longer than a doctor &apos;s appointment .
honey , i know . i told you .
i always felt bad for people
with emotionally distant fathers .
it turns out i &apos;m one of &apos; em .
it &apos;s a miracle i didn &apos;t end up a stripper .
thanks , everybody , for coming out .
these are some songs we wrote .
one , two . one , two , three .
* baby , don &apos;t leave me i just want you to know *
* i want you to know *
* there &apos;s something inside me that i cannot control *
* i cannot control *
our boyfriends totally rock !
i know , right ?
* i heard you screamin &apos; my name i &apos;m goin &apos; insane *
well , the plan was ...
to watch him for 10 minutes
and then run out to pepper &apos;s party .
* coursing through my veins *
but he was so great up there .
how @-@ how could i leave ?
* but don &apos;t be afraid *
* i &apos;ll be your vampire *
it was his moment .

and his moment went on for a really , really long time .
turns out i could have run to the party
and made it back for the end of his moment .
manny , go brush your teeth and get ready for bed , okay ?

can i watch tv ?
mmm , only 10 minutes .
okay .
hey , jay , it &apos;s ben dugan .

he &apos;ll realize it &apos;s all pretend .
you think that will work ?
guy &apos;s a sweetheart .
manny &apos;s gonna spend two minutes with him .
he &apos;ll explain how the movie &apos;s made .
