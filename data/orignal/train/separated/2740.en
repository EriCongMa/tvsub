Rusty!
Rusty!
You don't answer, someone calls you?
Look at this shit now.
What do you got for me, Counselor?
The Brioni.
Hear ye, hear ye.
The Honorable Dennis Holzer of the Eastern District of New York presiding.
Court is now in session. Be seated.
Come to order.
The defendant's request for temporary release from federal custody
to attend his daughter's wedding is ludicrous.
Mr. Sacrimoni is a known member of organized crime
at the helm of a vast criminal conspiracy.
I notice you're wearing a wedding ring, Ms. Vaughn.
Was your father at your wedding?
My father wasn't awaiting trial on 47 RlCO predicates,
including murder.
Mr. Sacrimoni...
your application is granted.
Oh, thank God!
On the following conditions. Quiet!
You'll be released for a total of six hours
to attend the church service and party thereafter.
During the entirety of the six hours,
you will be escorted by U.S. marshals.
The cost of their presence, transportation
and the cost of metal detection screening equipment
is to be borne by you at your own expense.
You will consume no alcohol
nor other intoxicating substances.
Do you understand and agree to these conditions?
I do, Your Honor, and thank you.
Mrs. Soprano, good morning. I'm Perry... Annunziata.
Come in.
Beautiful house.
You are Gina Annunziata's cousin, right?
Muscles Marinara, the ltalian strongman.
I'm just glad you got somebody capable of protecting you,
driving for you.
Well, that's why I got him here.
She worries, my wife.
Yeah, well...
He's in good hands, Mrs. Soprano.
First runner-up, Mr. Teenage Bloomfield.
Your first day back at work.
Gosh, I feel like a mommy.
Hey. Come on.
See you later.
So what do you do? Free weights, machines?
Little bit of both. Depends what muscles I'm trying to hit, you know?
Oh.
Yeah, I gotta get back to the gym.
You want, I'll make you a program.
There was a time when I could bench over 300 lbs.
With a major head cold one time, I did it.
You cough with weights like that over your head,
you crush your neck. I guess I don't gotta tell you.
Ho! You don't signal?
Hey, fuck you!
Sorry.
My mom says I should count 10, but I never remember.
Well, here I am.
Back.
Yep.
So let me ask you right off,
is there any chance of a mercy fuck?
Just kidding.
How are you feeling?
You went to medical school.
A gut shot is everything they ever told you it was.
And emotionally?
I'm happy to be alive.
Have you spoken to your uncle since it happened?
No. And won't.
Finally get to sleep in my own bed tonight.
Had a hospital bed in the house
last month and a half or so.
Is sleeping difficult?
Tylenol helps.
What about dreams,
night terrors, anything like that?
Gloom is your business, and business is good.
You were shot, Anthony, by a member of your family.
I know.
And unless I know absolutely nothing
I think you and I'll have a lot to talk about.
Are you familiar with the term
"post-traumatic stress"?
I get it, okay?
My uncle tried to kill me, for the second time.
Three strikes and I'm out, right?
Who knows? Maybe l am suppressing things.
But for right now, I feel like each day is a gift.
I told my sister.
And that's how it's gonna stay.
Fair enough.
Is there something else you'd like to talk about then?
Let's pick up where we left off before this all happened.
AJ.
Believe it or not,
things have gotten worse with that kid.
Flunked out of college. He waited till I was in a coma.
Didn't you leave Seton Hall after a semester and a half?
All right, fine,
but why can't he copy some of the good things about me?
Does he have a job?
Blockbuster.
First stop on the shitbird express.
In some ways, this horrible shooting may provide an opportunity
for him to learn from your mistakes.
My mistakes--
I got caught up in domestic violence.
You think it can't happen to you, but it does.
But I was referring to the bigger picture:
The ready access to guns,
the use of violence to solve disputes
because of the nature of your work, your uncle's work.
I told you I didn't want to talk about my uncle.
Fine, but for now is it safe to say
that there are worse ways to earn money
Yeah, there are.
Come on, you in or what?
Don't fuck with my concentration.
I've warned you before.
What is it? 800 more?
Fuck it. Fold.
Cards.
Oh! There's the skip.
Back with a vengeance.
You look great.
How are you?
Welcome home, T.
Come here, you malingerer you.
Easy easy easy.
Great to have you back, T.
Fucking great to be back.
Sit, Ton', I'll clear your spot. - We got you your bialy
as soon as we heard you were coming in today.
Nuke that joe so it's hot.
Oh, fuck.
The onions-- I can't.
Oh, scoop out that bialy.
I got it.
Sorry.
I got it, Ton', no problem.
There you go. I'll get your coffee, and you're all set.
So the municipal swimming pool--
the bid start on that yet?
I got a lunch tomorrow.
That guy Deutsch from the planning commission.
Antibiotics.
I had that with the spleen. Staves off the infection.
Spleen, my ass.
Beat this.
Oof, Madonn'.
Fuck that.
Check out this bad boy.
I had the plastic surgeon, Taschlin, do the outside sutures.
Plepler, the head trauma man, he did the inside work.
He dealt with the sepsis.
I was the first guy at the hospital to have the VAC.
It's an open-incision situation.
It's a better way to heal. Less pulling on the outer dermis layers.
The thing is with all the Ativan and the Dilaudid I was taking,
intestinal blockage was a constant fucking problem.
So in the long run--
There's your coffee, Ton'.
Yeah.
Ton', with your medicine,
you want I set my watch so you don't gotta worry? Nurse Betty over here.
When my mom had the lupus, God rest her soul,
'round the clock care I gave that woman.
Medicine, food, lifted her in and out of the tub.
The man's trying to eat.
I'm just saying.
Another life I might have gone into health care. I actually enjoyed it.
How about a bandage over your mouth then? We're trying to play.
You can lift a grown woman out of a tub?
Isn't it ironic?
Fucking hospital stay like mine,
you lose goddamn muscle mass, not fat.
Fucking believe it?
You'd think at least something good would have come out of the situation.
You in, Ton'?
Sure, why not?
He's in. - Same game, five-card calls?
Same game. Why? You wanna change games now 'cause I won three pots?
Keep the cards down, Sil.
The government's own neuropsychologist
clearly finds evidence of dementia.
Evidence consistent with dementia.
Nonetheless, I'm going to recommend he be sent
to a prison psychiatric facility for further evaluation.
He'll only be warehoused in a public facility.
Now, Your Honor, we ask that Mr. Soprano be sent
to a private locked facility. - Why not a resort in Antigua?
You want his mental state improved so you can put him on trial?
Just let him go to a place where he can get better.
You got Uncle Angelo at table 19?
What? He's with Connie and them.
And when he sees Aunt Lorraine and the Haitian boyfriend
sitting next to them...
I thought you were on top of this. - There's 400 people, John.
I've had other things on my mind.
And I'm idling away the hours?
Who's not talking to who?
This one can't see that one.
It's okay, honey. Take it easy.
You were the one who wanted a big wedding.
Catherine, your sister has enough to deal with without the commentary.
I'm sorry I blew my stack, okay?
We are gonna get through this as a family-- dignified, proud--
despite all the persecution and roadblocks.
And when I say family, that includes you, too, Eric.
Thank you, John.
Thank you who?
Thank you, Dad.
You...
I want you to relax. Make sure you eat.
You too.
Me? No, thank you.
I am eight lbs. away from my goal, and I am fitting in that dress
if it kills me.
Jesus, can we ever talk about anything
Three sixes.
Boat, 10s over Jacks.
Vito, you again.
All right, that's it for me.
Banker's hours.
Pace myself, doctor said.
You'd be surprised how much energy the body expends
during the healing process.
Penne Arabiatta,
go get the car cooled down, will you?
Penne Arabiatta.
Yeah, that's what I call him.
Red pepper flakes up his ass.
He's a fucking hothead.
Ton', Phil Leotardo's here.
All right, bring him in.
There he is. Back in business.
How's the labonza?
Oh, it's good.
You guys letting him win?
Listen, I need to bend your ear.
Can't it wait? I was just about to go.
I just sat in traffic all the way from Brooklyn.
I was up by John. He sends his regards.
He'd like you to do him a favor, though.
What now?
Our friend there, the Mayor of Munchkinland,
John wants him gone.
Jesus. Rusty?
John's worried he might find another puppet like Little Carmine,
try to run the family through him.
So why me hit him?
You guys got more buttons than my grandmother's fucking corsets.
John wants things to point away from the family.
You know what? Tell him no.
Time and again I've done his bidding.
It's time to set some limits.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Be well.
I thought I heard the door.
How was the first day?
It was good.
Tired, though.
You wanna take a nap?
Smells good.
Downy fresh.
God, this feels great.
It does.
Chris.
Let 'em in.
Ho! Where are the rest of the 40 thieves?
You got it?
Good week. 120 credit card numbers
but I won't charge you no extra.
Excellent.
Don't leave home without it. - No, we'll use them.
No, credit cards.
The commercial.
So Tony's out of hospital. Please give him our wishes.
We brought him some dates.
Also, Chris, you know how we can purchase
a couple of TEC-9 semi-automatics, extended magazines?
Hold on. TEC-9s? What the fuck for?
It's a family problem.
My former brother-in-law, actually.
All right, fucking take it easy.
What did the guy say?
Our friend from the other place, he talked to the guy?
What's his name, the local guy.
Yeah yeah, I know.
Hold on.
Yep, I see it. Thank you, Ro.
Mr. Sacrimoni, I'm Deputy Feathem, U.S. Marshal Service.
This is my partner Deputy Mayweather.
We're here to escort you to the wedding today.
Gentlemen.
Though ordered by the court, your release is at our discretion.
So based on your behavior or any other mitigating factors,
we can elect to bring you back early.
Patent leather? - It's a tuxedo.
Have you read an issue of "GQ" in the past three or four years?
Allegra Sacrimoni getting married.
Were we not just at her christening?
1980-- 50-lb. bundle of joy.
She'll be a beautiful bride, Tony.
All brides are beautiful. Wait till this one gets married.
How much are we giving? So I can write it down.
You keep tabs on gifts? How sentimental.
That's how it's done, Meadow.
So we can know if they stiff us
when your big day comes.
Exactly.
All this pressure. I know you'd like to think it's me pressuring you,
but the reality is it's your father keeps this going.
Please, like you aren't desperate to have a grandchild.
Any thoughts on when you and Finn are tying the knot?
This discussion is over.
Look, sweetie.
It's just...
what I been through,
it changes the way you think.
Holding my grandkids--
your kids--
on my lap...
all of a sudden, it's very important to me.
Could I have your name, sir?
Hey, is that the father? Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
Cell phones, cameras, keys.
All metal objects must be placed in a tray.
Sir, what is this?
Nitroglycerin. What do you think?
Cologne. Smell it, you don't believe me.
Proceed.
You'd think bin Laden was getting married in there.
You realize they made John pay for all this heightened security
out of his own pocket?
Are you kidding?
The government did that? - Mm-hmm.
You okay?
Yeah,
it's hot.
Almost there.
All metal objects in the tray, sir.
Jesus Christ!
Arms outstretched, please. All right,
you'll need to step out and remove your shoes, sir.
Oh, come on!
It's all right.
Tony, Tony!
Daddy! - AJ, get him a chair!
I should have worn loafers.
It ain't your fault, T. It's all this bullshit.
It's a steam bath.
I'll get a damp paper towel.
Sorry.
Here, Ton', some water.
He just got out of the hospital. Are the shoes really necessary?
Sorry, Miss. - Let me do it, don't bend.
All right.
I, Eric, take you, Allegra, to be my wife.
Allegra. Ain't that a cold medicine?
It means happiness in ltalian.
What the fuck's that got to do with cold medicine?
...forsaking all others so long as you both shall live.
In sickness and in health,
forsaking all others as long as we both shall live.
Allegra, repeat these words.
I, Allegra, take you, Eric, to be my husband...
I, Allegra, take you, Eric, to be my husband...
To have and to hold in good times and bad,
for richer and for poorer...
To have and to hold in good times and bad,
for richer and for poorer...
In sickness and in health,
forsaking all others,
so long as we both shall live.
In sickness and in health, forsaking all others, so long as we both shall live.
Would you believe this place, the money they've spent?
It's either this or give it to the feds in the asset seizure.
Check this out. They got a whole seafood station over there.
You're not hungry, sweetie? - I don't eat fish. The toxins.
Pinot grig for the missus.
Rum and coke for the kids.
Thank you.
And a club soda for the convalescent.
Thank you, sir.
Salut.
Hey, there he is.
Meadow, you look stunning.
Thank you.
And look at this young dentist,
all handsome in his Calvin Klein.
Some beautiful grandkids these two will make, huh?
So, Ton', you got a sec?
Yeah.
Listen, Ton', I don't mean to talk business,
but I had to tell you.
I met with that guy Deutsch, the one from the planning commission.
Not only is he in charge of approving bids for all city contracts,
he's also a degenerate horse player.
So he'll play ball?
He's fucking Joe DiMaggio.
And this is from Weehawken, the strip mall.
Enjoy your day.
Oh, here he is. Father of the bride.
Good to see you. - John, she looks so beautiful.
It was so moving. - Thank you, honey. I appreciate it. All this.
Hey, googootz, you wanna be an event planner,
you learn from this.
An event planner? Where do you get this shit?
"Stuff" would do nicely, AJ. We're at a wedding.
Good to see you, my friend.
You too, John.
It's been a long time. Obviously, I couldn't come visit you in the hospital.
When I heard what happened, I was devastated.
That's life, huh?
So seriously, what's the damages here?
What am I in for with Meadow?
Not counting the honeymoon, 425.
So adjusting for inflation,
I'm looking at half a rock.
What's it all for, though, Tony, huh? What we put in, the grind.
Isn't that for things like this?
Yeah.
So I heard Phil came to see you.
Let's go say hello to your dad.
So how you doing here? You having a good time?
Which one are you?
My friend Tony, Pop.
Hey, I'm gonna say a few things,
and these pricks are watching,
so I'm gonna make like I'm talking to your dad and them.
Hey, Aunt... Farris.
Hello.
What you asked me to do with the little guy,
I can't do it.
This fucking prick,
he's disruptive.
He doesn't have the balls to step up himself.
What did he say?
So just keep him away from Phil.
He's a cancer. I can't let it spread.
Well, you're gonna have to use one of your own doctors.
Oh, I'd love to. Believe me.
But my position is not completely solidified.
You should call Dr. Cuomo.
We're just talking here, Aunt Louise. - Don't eat that pepper!
When Carmine died...
What?
...Rusty could have been boss. He should have been.
But he didn't want the responsibility.
Like I advised you.
Say no more.
It's too fucking late now anyway.
I need your help, Tony.
Some of these guys, my captains,
they find out I'm behind the move against him?
Make things worse. I can't take that risk while I'm in jail.
Stay out of trouble.
So I'm supposed to put myself at risk,
share the same fucking jail cell as you?
What did he say?
I don't know.
Forget it, John.
It's Allegra's wedding, Tony.
The way things are,
I don't know if I'll be around for Catherine's.
I know you're going through a rough time right now, all right?
Then do me this favor, Tony.
Okay, I'll take care of it.
I won't forget it.
All right.
And now the moment we've all been waiting for,
for the first time anywhere,
Iet's give a huge hand and a lot of love to
Mr. and Mrs. Eric DiBenedetto! Allegra and Eric have chosen the lovely...
Ladies and gentlemen,
for their first dance as man and wife,
Please join our bride and groom on the dance floor.
How you doing over there?
I'm okay.
Wanna dance?
Really?
It's a slow one.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Okay, Corrado.
Taking any medication?
Coumadin.
Not bad, Corrado.
You got a tree outside.
Don't bullshit me.
Doctor will be in later to do a thorough admission.
So, I'll check in with you at the end of the week.
You're gonna get the help you need here, Corrado,
so you can aid in your own defense.
I didn't shoot anybody!
Corrado, look, I don't know you that well, but you have to--
He's my nephew, God damn it. Why would I shoot him? Why?
The gun was on the fritz.
I wanna go home.
Corrado, stop it. - I wanna go home!
Stop.
You know that's not possible.
If I did it, the fucking gun malfunctioned.
It was old, okay? I should have cleaned it.
Try to get some sleep.
You'll feel better in the morning.
Ladies and gentlemen, at this time
our lovely bride will dance with her father.
This is how it works, I'm thinking.
We bring somebody over from Naples.
What?
Completely insulate ourselves. They do Rusty,
they're back on a plane over the Atlantic two hours later.
I don't know, T. You ask me, farming it out is a pussy-ass maneuver.
Excuse me?
Ton', the rollatine!
Hold on.
If we're gonna do it, we should do it ourselves,
maintain control.
Better yet, tell New York to fucking handle it already.
John just asked me specifically.
So it's like the movie then.
What movie?
One. That you can't refuse a man's request
on his daughter's wedding day.
No, it's the other way around.
That I should be asking him for something he can't refuse.
So did you?
No.
You should ask not to do this.
I already fucking agreed.
Look, we wanna keep him placated, right?
I mean, the shit with Phil and his little brother
and the perpetual hard-on he's still got with us.
I don't think it's a good idea.
Well, I didn't ask you what you fucking think.
Come on.
You're going already?
He's always like this at weddings.
You make me sound rude. Crab cakes. I told you I don't feel good.
They don't keep in this heat.
Vito, let's go.
Francesca, come on.
Good night.
John, gonna have to wrap this up.
Six hours you said. I got till quarter till 11:00.
That includes transportation, sir.
You fucking kidding me?
I tried, John. They won't budge.
Can he have some cake at least?
You can pack some to take with you, if you'd like.
Heartless pricks.
Out front in 20.
Here they come!
Thank you, Daddy.
I love you, baby.
I love you, too.
Mom!
You came this close to almost making your goal.
Have a great time, sweetheart. - I'll call you when we land.
Bye, Grandpa.
Say hi to Don Ho.
I love you.
What the fuck?!
Let's go, John. - What? Wait a second.
Let's go.
Stand back, please.
Can you let my daughter leave at least?
Daddy, what's happening?
I will not ask you again.
You motherfucker.
Oh my God.
What are you doing?
Get your hands off him. Jesus Christ! Is that fucking necessary?
Stand back. Now!
John.
Wait.
Mom!
Oh God. Oh God!
Is she all right?
Ginny!
Oh my God!
Put her head back. Let me check her airway.
Go.
I'll tell you one thing, and I'm not ashamed to say it,
my estimation of John Sacrimoni as a man
just fucking plummeted.
Give him a break, will ya?
It's an emotional day.
To cry like a woman? It's a fucking disgrace.
His fucking coach turned into a pumpkin.
Well, even Cinderella didn't cry.
When it comes to daughters, all bets are off.
I've seen tougher guys than John cry at weddings.
Well, let me ask you this--
If they can make him cry and if he's that weak,
what the fuck else can they make him do?
I gotta agree with Phil, Ton'.
Oh, you do, do you?
Terrible out there, huh? Poor guy.
He's an emotional man. He loves his daughter.
I want to give you a home, take care of you.
Love you.
Oh, Steve.
You don't know me.
I still love...
Where are you going?
I gotta make some collections.
Now?
I thought you were sick.
Go to bed.
I'll see you later.
Maybe too much.
Don't think I want any less.
Do you love me?
I think I do.
We have been very lucky, Tony.
The house, the kids,
what we just went through at the hospital.
You make your own luck in life.
I'll stop by tomorrow.
What do you got for me, Nicky?
Let met get my wallet.
Fucking skeeve, this shit.
What's a guy gotta do to buy you a drink?
You just did it.
Vito?
What the fuck?
Sal, hey.
Fuck you doing?
Nothing. I was here. It's a joke.
You're a fucking fag?
Watch it, buddy.
You fucking watch it, cupcake.
Guys, come on. It's okay. - You think so?
Sal, please, it's a fucking joke.
Right, sure. Say hi to your wife.
I'm serious. I'm-- Sal, please.
Don't say nothing, Sal!
Fuck those jerks. What do you care what they think?
What? Leave me the fuck alone.
Honey.
Go back to sleep.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Hello.
Is Sil there?
Vito Spatafore.
Hello.
What do you know? What do you say?
What do I know? What do I say?
It's three o-fucking clock. Is Tony all right?
That's why I'm calling you. Checking in.
Last I saw, he was having dessert.
All right, then.
Everything else okay?
Yeah.
Call me on my cell, you need anything.
The point is they made me take off my shoes,
and I nearly passed out in front of everybody trying to bend over.
Well, that's not good.
People misinterpret.
They think you're weak, they see an opportunity.
They're my friends,
a lot of them, but they're also fucking jackals.
Alpha male.
It's subtle,
but since I been back, I been noticing certain looks
and people questioning my judgment where they never did before.
Sure, cat's away, bad habits set in.
In a perfect world
I just relax,
Iet them think whatever the fuck they want.
Act as if.
As if you're not feeling vulnerable.
As if you're the same old Anthony.
Strong, "I'm sure," decisive.
People see only what you allow them to see.
Yeah, I been thinking the same thing.
Thanks for the advice.
Glad to be of service.
Bring that. Come on, come on, come on!
Where you going?
Ho, get the skip a chair.
I don't want a chair. I'm fine.
Ton', how you doing?
What are you weighing these days? - Don't ask. 265.
Let's go.
Hey, what's up, Ton'?
Skip.
Hey, boss.
You talk to Vito?
Huh? I called him two times. He never called me back.
You try the house?
'Cause he called me just the other night.
Hungry, T.? You want, I'll have Bissell fix you a sandwich.
No no, I'm good. I'm good.
What's your fucking problem?
Huh?
What the fuck is your problem?
Slamming the goddamn refrigerator door.
What? No.
Are you gonna argue with me now?
I didn't even open the refrigerator.
The Coke was out on the counter.
So you are gonna argue with me, huh, you fucking mutt?
Look, Tony, I don't wanna--
You don't wanna what? You don't wanna what?
This fucking guy, huh?
Fucking Philadelphia lawyer.
Jesus!
Don't do it! - No, don't do it!
My arm!
How's that, huh?
You got anything else to say?
