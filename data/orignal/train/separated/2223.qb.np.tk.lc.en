there is a town in maine
where every storybook character you &apos;ve ever known
is trapped between two worlds ...
you &apos;re the only thing in this whole place that feels right .
victims of a powerful curse ...
the evil queen sent everyone from the enchanted forest here .
they don &apos;t remember who they are .
i just wanna make sure henry &apos;s okay .
he &apos;s fine .
she &apos;s a con woman . all i &apos;m doing is trying to protect you .
you belong together .
how in the hell did you get like this ?
only one knows the truth ...
how far are you willing to go ?
as far as it takes .
and she &apos;ll stop at nothing ...
graham !
till someone breaks the spell .
graham ! graham !
don &apos;t underestimate me .
you have no idea what i &apos;m capable of .
papa ! papa !
they &apos;ve come for morraine .
no ! no !
no ! no ! please . please .
no ! don &apos;t take her !
please .
no ! you can &apos;t take her !
she &apos;s my baby ! don &apos;t take my baby !
nonsense . she &apos;s a fine , strong girl .
she &apos;ll make a fine soldier .
it &apos;s a mistake . she &apos;s turning 14 . only 14 !
orders of the duke .
the ogre wars have taken their toll this season .
more troops will turn the tide .
they lowered the age again , papa .
i know .
take her .
no !
she &apos;ll ride with me .
no ! you can &apos;t have her !
the dark one seems to think i can .
my birthday is in three days .
they &apos;ll come for me in three days .
we &apos;ll find a way . we &apos;ll ... we &apos;ll find a way .
gold ?
you in here ?
well , it is my shop .
what is that ?
oh , this is lanolin . used for waterproofing .
it smells like livestock .
well , it is the reason why sheeps &apos; wool repels water .
it stinks .
um , if there was a reason you called the sheriff &apos;s department ,
if you want to talk about that quickly or outside ...
yes .
i just wanted to , uh , express my condolences , really .
the sheriff was a good man .
you &apos;re still wearing the deputy &apos;s badge .
well , he &apos;s been gone two weeks now .
and i believe that after two weeks of acting as sheriff ,
the job becomes yours .
you &apos;ll have to wear the real badge .
yeah , i guess .
i &apos;m just not in a hurry .
so , um , thank you for the kind words .
i have his things .
what ?
the sheriff .
he rented an apartment that i own .
another reason for my call , really .
i wanted to offer you a keepsake .
i don &apos;t need anything .
as you wish .
i &apos;ll give them to mayor mills .
it seems like she was the closest thing he had to family .
i &apos;m not sure about that .
no love lost there , i see .
i fear that all of this stuff
is headed directly for the trash bin .
you really should take something .
look . his jacket .
no .
well , look .
your boy might like these , don &apos;t you think ?
you could play together .
i don &apos;t ...
no , please .
they ... they grow up so fast .
thanks .
you enjoy these with your boy .
your time together is precious , you know ?
that &apos;s the thing about children--
before you know it ...
you lose them .
brought you something .
thought we could use them together for operation cobra .
thanks .
oh , come on .
what &apos;s up ? you &apos;ve been ducking me for weeks .
i think we should stop cobra stuff for a while .
you don &apos;t play with a curse .
look what happened to graham .
henry , i told you . they did an autopsy .
it &apos;s totally natural causes .
okay , whatever . you don &apos;t believe . good .
i could keep you from messing with it
and getting killed .
you &apos;re worried about me ?
she killed graham because he was good .
and you &apos;re good .
henry ...
good loses . good always loses ,
because good has to play fair .
evil doesn &apos;t .
she &apos;s evil .
this is probably best .
i don &apos;t want to upset her any more .
i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s not for you .
it &apos;s been two weeks .
promotion is automatic .
unless the mayor appoints someone else
within the time period , which i &apos;m doing today .
so who &apos;s it gonna be ?
after due reflection , sidney glass .
sidney from the newspaper ?
how does that even make sense ?
well , he &apos;s covered the sheriff &apos;s office
for as long as anyone can remember .
and he &apos;ll do whatever you want him to .
you just cannot stand the fact
that things have been getting better around here , can you ?
better ?
are you referring to graham &apos;s death as better ?
no .
he was a good man , ms. swan .
he made this town safe , and forgive me for saying it ,
but you have not earned the right to wear his badge .
graham picked me ... to be deputy .
he was wrong .
no , he knew what he was doing .
he freed this office from your leash .
you &apos;re not getting it back .
actually , i just did .
ms. swan , you &apos;re fired .
toaster broken ?
it wasn &apos;t when i started with it .
pretty sure it is now .
i just needed to hit something .
what &apos;s going on ?
regina fired me
so she could put one of her own puppets in as sheriff .
that &apos;s my job .
never heard you so passionate about it before .
what happened ?
i don &apos;t know . i just ...
i know i want it back .
there must be a reason .
maybe ...
i just want to beat her .
good evening , ms. swan . sorry for the intrusion .
there &apos;s something i &apos;d like to discuss with you .
i &apos;ll let you two talk .
come on in .
thank you .
i ,
i heard about what happened . such an injustice .
yeah , well , what &apos;s done is done .
spoken like a true fighter .
i don &apos;t know what chance i have .
she &apos;s mayor , and i &apos;m ...
well ... me .
ms. swan , two people with a common goal
can accomplish many things .
two people with a common enemy ...
can accomplish even more .
how would you like a benefactor ?
a benefactor ?
do you mind ?
you know ...
it really is , quite shocking
how few people study the town charter .
the town charter ?
well , it &apos;s quite comprehensive .
and the mayor &apos;s authority ?
well , maybe she &apos;s not quite as powerful as she seems .
bae .
bae .
waken up , son . come on , waken up , son .
we &apos;re going now . we &apos;re going now . come on . come on .
it feels wrong to run away .
it &apos;s worse to die , son .
i &apos;m not having you taken away to that ogres @-@ war .
alms ? alms for the poor ? alms for the poor ?
yes .
oh , thank you . thank you .
thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you .
are we sure there &apos;s no other way ?
oh , i can &apos;t lose you , bae .
you &apos;re all i got left , son .
you don &apos;t understand what war is like ,
what they do to you .
quick . hide . in the ditch . hide . go . go .
go !
stop right there !
what are you doing on the king &apos;s road ?
we have some wool to sell at the fair in longbourne , sir .
i know you , don &apos;t i ?
what was your name ?
spindleshanks ?
threadwhistle ?
hobblefoot ?
his name &apos;s rumplestiltskin .
hush , boy .
rumple ...
the man who ran .
is this your boy ?
how old is he ?
what &apos;s your name ?
i &apos;m baelfire and i &apos;m 13 .
when &apos;s your birthday ?
in two days &apos; time .
hush , boy .
did you teach him how to run as well , rumplestiltskin ?
did he tell you ?
did he tell you how he ran ,
and the ogres turned the tide of the battle ,
and all the others were killed ?
and he returned home
to a wife who could not bear the sight of him .
please .
you see , women do not like to be married to cowards .
please don &apos;t speak to my boy like that .
it &apos;s treason to avoid service .
take the boy now .
no . no . no . no . what do you want ?
what do i want ?
you have no money ,
no influence , no land , no title , no power .
the truth is , all you really have is fealty .
kiss my boot .
i don &apos;t understand .
you asked my price .
kiss my boot .
not in front of my boy .
kiss my boot !
papa !
no . no . no .
it &apos;s okay . let me help you . let me help you home .
thank you , old man .
i don &apos;t have any money to pay you .
i can think of another way .
you just feed me whatever you can spare ,
and i &apos;ll find a way to be your benefactor .
come . come .
come .
everyone deserves to feel safe in their own homes .
that &apos;s why sidney glass is my choice for post of sheriff .
this man has put the needs of storybrooke above his own
for as long as any of us can remember ,
as chief editor of the storybrooke &quot; daily mirror . &quot;
please welcome
your new sheriff .
hang on a second .
oh , ms. swan , this is not appropriate .
the only thing not appropriate is this ceremony .
she does not have the power to appoint him .
the town charter clearly states &quot; the mayor shall appoint &quot; --
a candidate . you can appoint a candidate .
it calls for an election .
the term &quot; candidate &quot; is applied loosely .
no , it &apos;s not . it requires a vote .
and guess what , madam mayor-- i &apos;m running .
fine . so is sidney .
i am ?
i am .
with my full support .
i &apos;ll guess we &apos;ll learn a little something
about the will of the people .
i guess we will .
another day gone .
there &apos;ll be no fleeing now .
no .
you need to find another way .
you need to choose a different path .
choose ?
what choice do i have ?
everyone has a choice .
i &apos;m the town ... coward .
the only choice i have ...
is which corner to hide in .
i &apos;m lame ...
friendless ...
the only thing i &apos;ve got is my boy ...
and they &apos;re gonna take him away from me .
if they take him away , i will truly ...
truly become dust .
not if you have power .
you may as well say diamonds .
get a hold of yourself .
think .
why do you think that someone as powerful as the dark one
would work for a useless fool like the duke of the frontlands ?
tell me .
the duke has the dark one in thrall .
he &apos;s enslaved him with the power of a mystical dagger .
and on the blade is written a name--
the true name of the dark one .
if you were to steal the dagger ...
then you would control the dark one yourself ,
and then no one
would be able to take your son away from you .
but ...
to keep a man like the dark one as a slave ?
no . i @-@ i can &apos;t .
i &apos;d be terrified .
then perhaps
instead of controlling the power ...
you need to take it .
regina .
shall i move some things ,
make a bit of space for your rage ?
you found that loophole in the town charter .
legal documents-- contracts if you like--
always been a fascination of mine .
yes , you love to trifle with technicalities .
i like small weapons , you see--
the needle ,
the pen ,
the fine point of a deal .
subtlety-- not your style , i know .
you &apos;re a bastard .
i think your grief &apos;s getting the better of you , regina .
shame what happened to graham .
don &apos;t you talk about him .
you know nothing .
what is there to know ? he died .
are you really going up against me ?
not directly .
we are , after all ,
both invested in the common good .
we &apos;re just picking different sides .
well , i think you picked a really slow horse this time .
it &apos;s not like you to back a loser .
she hasn &apos;t lost yet .
she will .
never underestimate someone who &apos;s acting for their child .
he &apos;s not her child .
not legally .
now who &apos;s trifling with technicalities ?
how was school ?
okay .
you &apos;re reading that paper pretty hard .
sidney wrote it .
is it a lie ?
曾经的囚徒 艾玛 · 斯旺监狱产子
no .
i was born in jail ?
yes .
these records were supposed to be sealed .
tell me you &apos;re not scarred for life .
i &apos;m not .
well , not by this .
good . then let &apos;s throw this out ,
and we will get our news from something more reliable ,
like the internet .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been trying to tell you .
good can &apos;t beat evil
because good doesn &apos;t do this kind of thing .
my mom plays dirty .
that &apos;s why you can &apos;t beat her , ever .
i have a new ally . mr. gold said he &apos;s gonna help .
mr. gold ?
he &apos;s even worse than she is .
you already owe him one favor .
you don &apos;t want to owe him any more .
don &apos;t do this .
this was a juvie record .
this was sealed by court order .
i don &apos;t know how you got it ,
but that &apos;s abuse of power and illegal .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . you didn &apos;t want people to know
you cut his cord with a shiv ?
i don &apos;t care what people know ,
but this hurts henry .
he would &apos;ve learned eventually .
we all lose our heroes at some point .
he doesn &apos;t need to lose anything more .
he &apos;s depressed , madam mayor .
he doesn &apos;t have any ... any hope . don &apos;t you see that ?
he &apos;s fine .
he &apos;s not fine .
i mean , think about it-- watching his adoptive mother
throw an illegal smear campaign against his birth mother ?
you don &apos;t think that would be upsetting ?
all i did was expose him to the truth .
and as for the legality ,
i did nothing wrong .
but you and sidney will have a chance
to get into all that at the debate .
debate ?
yes , ms. swan , there &apos;s a debate .
you two can talk about jail time and juvie records
and maybe even your new association with mr. gold .
he &apos;s a snake , ms. swan .
you need to be careful who you get into bed with .
i &apos;m not getting into bed with anyone .
i &apos;m just fighting fire with--
all right . come on . let &apos;s go . we gotta get out of here .
i can &apos;t move ! you have to get me out .
help me .
keep that fire good and stoked , bae .
the sheep &apos;s fat needs to be liquid .
and get that wool good and soaked .
why are we doing this , papa ?
this is good wool . we can spin and sell .
these are our keys to the castle , son .
once i &apos;m inside , there &apos;s something i have to take .
what do you need to take ?
that old beggar-- he told me a fine tale
about the duke and his magical dagger .
what does it do ?
if i own that dagger ,
i control the dark one .
if i kill the dark one with the dagger ,
i take his powers .
by god &apos;s name .
imagine me with those powers .
can you imagine me with those powers , bae ?
i could get to redeem myself .
i could turn it towards good .
i &apos;ll save all the children of the frontlands ,
not just you , my boy .
i &apos;d love to see that ,
but if the law says i &apos;m to fight , i @-@ i can fight .
no . no . the--the law doesn &apos;t want you to fight , son .
the law wants you to die .
that &apos;s not battle .
that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s a sacrifice , son .
you look at that red in the sky .
that &apos;s not the--the fires of the battlefields .
that &apos;s the blood of our people , son .
it &apos;s the blood of children ,
the blood of children like you .
i mean , what sane person would want to get involved with that ?
so it &apos;s true ?
what ?
it &apos;s true--it &apos;s true you ran .
i had no choice , son .
and mother--
did she leave you like the knight said ?
you told me she was dead .
she is dead .
so ... what do we need to do ?
the duke &apos;s castle is made of stone ,
but the floors and the rafters ...
made of wood .
why does that matter ?
because wood burns .
you &apos;re gonna leave me , aren &apos;t you ?
oh ! oh ! ow ! my ankle !
set me down gently !
seriously ? you &apos;re complaining about how i saved your life ?
the firemen are here .
it &apos;s not like we were really in danger .
fine .
next time , i &apos;ll just--
no , you know what ? next time , i &apos;ll do the same thing
and the time after that ,
because that is what decent human beings do .
that &apos;s what good people do .
hey , did emma really rescue my mom ?
enough .
regina .
i &apos;m fine .
a nice shot of the victim ?
sidney , what the hell are you doing ?
are you trying to hand this election to her ?
but it &apos;s news .
she &apos;s the competition , you fool .
did you really rescue regina ?
she did . the firemen said it .
they saw it .
you are a hero .
we should see if they have a picture of the rescue .
we can make campaign posters .
oh , people would love that . that &apos;s a great idea .
wait .
so i &apos;ll get the photo and then you--
can you write it up ?
this is how good wins .
you do something good , and people see it
and then they wanna help you .
maybe you &apos;re right .
you see , henry ?
we don &apos;t have to fight dirty .
loads of visitors today .
i do hope you &apos;re not gonna break my little bell .
you set the fire .
i &apos;ve been right here , ms. swan .
take a whiff . it smells like your sheep crap oil .
turns out it &apos;s flammable .
well , are you sure ?
there &apos;s some construction working
on at city hall at the moment .
there &apos;s loads of flammable solvents used in construction .
why did you do it ?
if i did it ,
if i did it , that would be because
you cannot win without something big ,
something like , uh ,
oh , i don &apos;t know , being the hero in a fire ?
how could you even know i &apos;d be there at the right time ?
maybe regina &apos;s not the only one with eyes and ears in this town
or maybe ... i &apos;m just intuitive .
were i involved .
i could &apos;ve run and left her there .
not the type .
i can &apos;t go along with this .
you just did .
this is just the price of election , ms. swan .
a price i &apos;m not willing to pay .
find another sucker .
okay , go ahead . expose me .
but if you do ,
just think about what you &apos;ll be exposing
and what you &apos;ll be walking away from .
oh , yes , and , uh ,
who you might be disappointing .

david , hi .
mary margaret .
i was just , uh ...
yeah , me , too .
how are things ?
okay .
oh , i got a job .
yeah . i &apos;m working at the animal shelter .
really ?
yeah .
so ... sidney ?
yeah , well , my wife is friends with regina , so ...
oh , right . how is kathryn ?
good . she &apos;s meeting me here later .
that &apos;s wonderful .
well , i &apos;m all out of posters . i &apos;m gonna go get some more .
citizens of storybrooke ,
uh , we welcome you to--
uh , welcome , citizens of storybrooke .
oh . uh , we welcome you--
citizens of storybrooke , welcome , uh ...
i &apos;m not gonna win .
what are you talking about ?
everyone &apos;s talking about what you did in the fire .
no , henry &apos;s right .
i can &apos;t beat regina at this , not the way she fights .
watch and see .
is this really just about beating regina ?
it &apos;s just ...
henry .
i want to show him that good can actually win .
that &apos;s why you want to win it for him ,
but why do you want to win the election for yourself ?
that is why .
i want to show him that a hero can win .
and if i &apos;m not ...
if i &apos;m not a hero and i &apos;m not the savior ,
then what part do i have in his life ?
okay . there it is .
there it is .
papa ! i was so worried for you .
bae
are you burned ? the castle--
i &apos;m fine , son . i &apos;m fine .
i need you to go home and wait for me there .
come with me , please . i have a bad feeling .
bae , this is something i have to do on my own .
go home , son .
go home and wait for me , bae .
i &apos;ll be back . you go .
zoso .
zoso .
i summon thee .
you were asking for me ?
submit , oh dark one !
i control you .
yes , you do .
wield the power wisely .
you can wield at any time now .
it &apos;s almost dawn .
that means it &apos;s your son &apos;s birthday .
i bet hordor and his men are already on their way to your house .
no , they can &apos;t take him .
you don &apos;t control them .
you control me .
have you ever wondered
was he really your child at all ?
unlike you , he &apos;s not a coward
and yearns to fight and die in glory .
no .
what a poor bargain that would be--
to lay down your soul to save your bastard son .
so i ask you ...
what would you ...
have me ...
do ?
die !
it &apos;s you .
you &apos;re the beggar .
looks like you made a deal you didn &apos;t understand .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna do that again .
you told me to kill you ?
my life was such a burden .
you &apos;ll see .
magic always comes with a price ,
and now it &apos;s yours to pay .
why me ? why me ?
i know how to recognize ...
a desperate soul .
no .
no ! stay !
you have to tell me what to do !
tell me what to do !
rumplestiltskin
tragedy has brought us here ,
but we are faced with this decision ,
and now we ask only that you listen with an open mind
and to please vote your conscience .
so without further ado , i &apos;d like to introduce you
to the candidates-- sidney glass
and emma swan .
glass . swan .
sounds like something that a decorator would make you buy .
wow . crickets . okay , uh ...
uh , mr. glass , your opening statement .
i just want to say that if elected ,
i want to serve as a reflection of the best qualities of storybrooke--
honesty ,
neighborliness ...
and strength .
thank you .
and emma swan .
you guys all know i have ...
what they call a , uh ,
troubled past ,
but you &apos;ve been able to overlook it
because of the , um ...
hero thing .
but here &apos;s the thing ,
the fire was a setup .
mr. gold agreed to support me in this race ,
but i didn &apos;t know that that meant he was going to set a fire .
i don &apos;t have definitive evidence ,
but i &apos;m sure .
and the worst part of all this was ...
the worst part of all this is ,
i let you all think it was real .
and i can &apos;t win that way .
i &apos;m sorry .
another ?
oh , hell , yes .
hey , henry .
what &apos;s this for ?
you stood up to mr. gold .
it &apos;s pretty amazing .
he did something illegal .
that &apos;s what heroes do ,
expose stuff like that .
i shouldn &apos;t have given up on operation cobra .
i thought i might find you here .
with a drink .
and my son .
here to card me , officer ?
well , not at all . in fact , i think i &apos;ll join you .
here ? i don &apos;t know .
i think they &apos;re setting up a back room for the victory party .
well , you &apos;ll have to tell me what that &apos;s like .
congratulations .
sheriff swan .
wait . what ?
it was a very close vote .
but people really seem to like the idea of a sheriff
brave enough to stand up to mr. gold .
are you joking ?
she doesn &apos;t joke .
you didn &apos;t pick a great friend in mr. gold , ms. swan .
but he does make a superlative enemy .
enjoy that .
everyone &apos;s watching from behind their curtains today .
dark one .
no .
who are you ?
have you forgotten me already ?
what was it you used to call me again ?
spindleshanks ?
hobblefoot .
papa ?
rumplestiltskin .
wonderful .
and now you shall know me ,
as the new dark one .
how about a little fealty ?
kiss my boot .
no ! papa !
papa ?
what has happened to you ?
you &apos;re safe , bae .
do you feel safe , son ?
no .
i &apos;m frightened .
i &apos;m not .
i protected what belongs to me .
and i &apos;m not scared of anything .
the sheriff &apos;s jacket ,
i thought you might want it after all .
you do know i &apos;m armed , right ?
it &apos;s all part of the act , my dear .
political theater in an actual theater .
i knew no one was gonna vote for you ,
unless we gave you some kind of extraordinary quality .
and i &apos;m afraid saving old regina &apos;s arse from the fire
just wasn &apos;t gonna do that .
we had to give you a higher form of bravery .
they had to see you defy me ,
and they did .
no way .
there is no way you planned that .
everyone &apos;s afraid of regina ,
but they &apos;re more afraid of me .
by standing up to me , you won them over .
it was the only way .
you knew i &apos;d agree .
oh , yeah .
i know how to recognize a desperate soul .
why did you do this ?
we made a deal some time back , ms. swan .
we established that you owed me a favor .
i know that can be a bad feeling ,
owing someone .
now that you &apos;re sheriff ,
i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll find some way for you to pay back what you owe me .
congratulations .
