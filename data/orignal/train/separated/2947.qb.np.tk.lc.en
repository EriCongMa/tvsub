hey .
yeah . yeah , okay . sure .
look , can we talk about what happened here last night ?
sure . just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you .
you believe that whoever did something last night did what they did or didn &apos;t do ?
okay , you really don &apos;t know what i &apos;m talking about ?
no .
okay . last night , after the party ..
i saw rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony .
our balcony ? seriously ?
that &apos;s so funny . i told monica we should put lights on our balcony ..
and she said , &quot; no , no . it &apos;s too cold . nobody will go out there . &quot; and i said :
&quot; maybe if we put some lights out there they will . &quot;
right , that &apos;s what i came over to talk about . i saw rachel kissing some guy ..
on your balcony , even though there were no lights !
so are you gonna talk to her ?
why ? why should i ? i mean , if she wants to move on , that &apos;s fine .
you know when &quot; that &apos;s fine &quot; sounds true ? when someone yells it and spits .
no , i &apos;m serious . i mean , if she wants to date people , fine . i don &apos;t care .
but at least she could have told me .
you know , i &apos;ve been putting my life on hold and concentrating on emma .
but if she wants to go out there kissing guys she barely knows , then so will i.
very funny ! ross is gay !
no , no . good , so you &apos;re moving on .
do you have any idea where you &apos;re moving on to ?
i &apos;ve got plenty of opportunities .
just now , there was some woman at the coffeehouse smiled at me .
and then the other day on the subway , a woman &quot; accidentally &quot; sat on my hand .
dude , don &apos;t rub my face in your crazy single life .
and there &apos;s an anthropologist at school ..
who totally came on to me during the interdepartmental potluck dinner .
why did i get married ?
the.one.where.monica.sings
hey , let me ask you guys something .
i &apos;m having new headshots taken tomorrow .
the photographer said she thinks i should have my eyebrows waxed .
is that weird for a guy ?
well , it depends .
on ?
on how far along he is in the sex @-@ change process .
no , i totally disagree . i think it &apos;s fine for a guy to do something like that .
especially an actor .
i mean , not that you need to . your eyebrows are ..
stop it , you guys . stop staring , you &apos;re freaking me out .
your knuckles are kind of hairy too .
oh , man , now i have to get those done too ?
wow , talk about high maintenance .
you dye your hair .
i &apos;m a woman .
double standards !
before i forget , are you coming to mike &apos;s piano bar tonight ?
only if i don &apos;t have to get up and sing .
but everybody sings . it &apos;s so fun .
last time , this adorable old man got up there , forgot all the words , flipped out ..
and everyone booed him off the stage . it was so funny
look , i &apos;m not good at singing .
oh , what &apos;s the matter ? you scared ? you afraid i &apos;m a better singer ?
you afraid i &apos;m gonna beat you at singing ?
nope . nope . it &apos;s not working on me .
wow , i must be growing up .
okay , fine . just please come and support mike . you don &apos;t have to sing .
so i don &apos;t have to sing , and i can just sit there and pass judgment on others ?
while drinking .
i &apos;m there .
hi , you guys . listen , i really need your help .
i think i did something really stupid .
well , yes , rachel , but you got something so beautiful out of it .
no , not that . i kissed gavin last night .
my god .
you kissed him ?
yeah , it was after the party , we were on the balcony ..
wait , wait , wait . i was at home the whole time . how did i miss that ?
well , it was the end of the party . you were probably ironing wrapping paper .
oh , yeah .
so how did you end up kissing ?
we were all alone and he was being really nice ..
and he gave me this scarf .
i thought you hated him .
well , there is a thin line between love and hate ..
and it turns out that line is a scarf .
are you thinking of starting something up with this guy ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s so complicated . i work with this guy .
i have the baby , and i have ross . i don &apos;t know what to do .
and i have to be at the office and see gavin in 10 minutes .
sounds like you need to think about what you want and talk to gavin .
and you definitely should talk to ross .
or ..
i could call in sick and not deal with it at all .
wow ! five months maternity leave , you &apos;re back for four days ..
kiss a co @-@ worker and call in sick . they are lucky to have you .
hi .
hi .
i &apos;m here for my eyebrow appointment .
name ?
chandler bing .
okay , very good .
have a seat right here , mr. bing , and sonya will be right with you .
okay . thanks .
i touched the stuff .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
thanks .
so do you .. ? do you get a lot of guys in here ?
oh , absolutely .
oh , good .
you looking to meet somebody ?
all right , let &apos;s just do this .
okay , we &apos;ll get to the wax in a minute .
first , i want to tweeze some of the strays , okay ?
now , this may sting just a little bit .
i have an extremely high threshold ..
holy mother of god ! oh , my face ! my face !
i &apos;m all right . i &apos;m all right . i &apos;m all right .
it &apos;s just a bit of shock , that &apos;s all .
but i &apos;ll be fine . you can go again .
okay .
sorry .
damn it , woman !
it &apos;s the most eligible man in new york . how &apos;s the moving on going ?
not well . i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand ..
but that person was neither female nor wearing pants .
maybe you &apos;re going about this the wrong way . i mean , think about it :
single white male , divorced three times , two illegitimate children .
the personal ad writes itself .
you know , that &apos;s funny . yeah . so do you think you &apos;ll ever work again ?
what are you doing ? you know i can only dish it out .
i can &apos;t believe rachel just moved on and didn &apos;t say anything to me .
maybe she didn &apos;t move on .
maybe that kiss was just an impulsive , one @-@ time birthday thing .
no , a month ago , she gave her number to some guy in a bar .
did she go out with him ?
no . when he called ..
i threw the message away .
the high road .
all right , you know what ? enough . enough talking . i have to get moving .
hey , check out those two blonds over there . hey , come with me .
are you trying to get everybody divorced ?
you don &apos;t have to do anything . it &apos;ll just be easier if it &apos;s two of us .
like college , remember ? first , you break the ice with some kind of a joke ..
so they know you &apos;re the funny one . i swoop in with interesting conversation ..
so they &apos;ll see that i &apos;m the brilliant , brooding , sexy one .
i thought i got to make the jokes .
don &apos;t you have to be at work ?
oh , come on .
hello . hi , my name &apos;s chandler . this is my friend ross right here .
we were wondering ..
if you &apos;re up for it , we only need six more people for a human pyramid .
swoop . swoop .
hey , i notice you &apos;re reading the paper .
another flood in europe , huh ?
here &apos;s a question :
would you rather drown or be burned alive ?
i &apos;m sorry , we &apos;re just leaving .
okay .
we still got it .
who is it ?
gavin . i brought you some soup .
why ?
i heard you were sick .
oh , right ! hold on , let me just clean up in here a little bit .
hello , gavin .
i missed you at work . how you feeling ?
i &apos;m not gonna lie to you , i &apos;m pretty sick .
oh , good . because i was having a totally paranoid moment ..
where i thought you called in sick to avoid me .
oh , no , no , no .
so i had fun last night .
so did i.
exactly how contagious is this thing you have ?
is it a cold from standing on the balcony , or did a monkey bite you ?
it &apos;s just a cold .
do you have a fever ?
let me see .
what ? what is it ? what &apos;s the matter ?
what &apos;s ross doing to you in that picture ?
oh , he &apos;s dusting me with a fossil brush .
he thought it would be funny .
right . right .
yeah .
ross .
yeah .
what &apos;s the deal with you guys ? i don &apos;t wanna get in the middle of anything .
you &apos;re not getting in the middle of anything . don &apos;t worry about ross .
hide ! that &apos;s ross ! hide !
hide ! hide !
yeah , but you said not to worry ..
i lied and i &apos;m not sick either ! just stay behind the curtain !
hi .
oh , molly . you &apos;re not ross .
no . i &apos;m here to take emma to your mother &apos;s , remember ?
right . yes , yes .
don &apos;t panic .
what ?
there is a man behind your curtain .
i have mace in my purse .
no , that &apos;s okay ! no , no , no .
this is my business associate gavin being silly . come out from behind there .
hi . gavin . pleased to meet you .
it was my idea to stand there .
hello . i &apos;ll just go get emma .
okay .
so ..
why did i have to hide ?
i thought it was ross .
i thought there was nothing going on between you .
there isn &apos;t . there totally isn &apos;t .
you hear keys in the hall and you jump like a bronco coming out of the chute .
i used to be a rodeo clown .
all right , look , gavin ..
i guess i felt guilty that you were here ..
which i shouldn &apos;t .
you know , ross and l are not in a relationship ..
but he is the father of my child . and , you know ..
we do live together . and plus , there &apos;s just so much history , you know ?
it &apos;s just .. i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just all over the place .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s probably not my place , but can i give you a piece of advice ?
yes .
you should talk to ross about all this .
people keep saying that .
i &apos;m sorry , gavin .
don &apos;t be .
it &apos;s just bad timing .
so seriously , rodeo clown ?
one of the best , ma &apos;am . one of the best .
oh , she &apos;s my girlfriend . that &apos;s not just how we do it here .
i &apos;m gonna take a little break , and when we come back ..
we &apos;ve got kenneth singing &quot; i touch myself . &quot;
i &apos;m not here to judge .
you have got to sing .
no , i told you i can &apos;t .
but you would have so much fun . and you have a really nice voice .
when have you heard me sing ?
all the time , when you &apos;re cooking .
what ?
yeah , you &apos;re always singing :
yummy , yummy , yummy i &apos;ve got love in my tummy
yeah , i do rock that one .
isn &apos;t there just a little part of you that wants to get up there ?
just a little . but , god , it &apos;s so scary .
i don &apos;t even know what i would sing .
well , i &apos;ve got a book around ..
&quot; delta dawn . &quot;
hi . i couldn &apos;t help but notice , but that &apos;s an unusual necklace .
you already hit on me an hour ago .
right . so that &apos;s a firm no ?
i don &apos;t believe this . i just keep striking out .
i don &apos;t get it either .
i mean , you &apos;re obviously desperate .
you &apos;re asking women how they wanna be killed .
this is great . rachel &apos;s gonna keep kissing guys ..
until she finds the one she wants , and i &apos;m gonna die alone .
by drowning or .. ?
why would he break up with me ?
i don &apos;t know , sweetie .
all i ever wanted was to just love him and have him love me back .
i mean , am i so unlovable ?
wow .
i know .
all right . that was kenneth with his ..
much too literal rendition of &quot; i touch myself . &quot;
coming up next , we &apos;ve got monica singing &quot; delta dawn . &quot;
wait . i can &apos;t sing in front of all these people .
just pretend they &apos;re not even here . it &apos;s okay .
once that spotlight hits you , it &apos;s so bright , you won &apos;t see anyone anyway .
hi , i &apos;m monica . and i &apos;m going to be singing &quot; delta dawn . &quot;
can you totally see through her shirt ?
like an x @-@ ray .
bad day not to wear a bra .
i &apos;m calling about the advertising job .
yes , i realize it would be entry level .
oh , so would i actually have to wear the chicken suit ?
i need your help .
wow , it seems serious .
what seems to be the problem , ashley judd ?
i &apos;m getting new headshots taken . so i went to get my eyebrows shaped .
i &apos;m sorry . moment to make fun of that , please .
i may be a sissy , but i &apos;ll still pound you into the ground .
look , it hurt so bad , i could only let her do one eyebrow , and now ..
they don &apos;t match !
it &apos;s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama .
you got to help me out , okay ? look , i have a magic marker .
fill in the skinny one so i don &apos;t look stupid for my pictures .
okay , first of all , this is green .
what the hell am i supposed to do ? !
i will help you out ..
but you have to promise you won &apos;t tell anyone what i &apos;m about to tell you .
what ? what ?
okay .
you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn ..
or taking out the garbage ? well , i earned mine ..
by plucking the eyebrows of my father and his &quot; business partners . &quot;
oh , my god .
yeah , well , i guess you don &apos;t need my help , victor @-@ victoria .
no , no , no . i do . i do . i need your help .
but , chandler , i don &apos;t know if i can take any more plucking . it hurt so bad .
not with my combination of ice cubes , aloe vera and my gentle ..
self @-@ loathing touch .
i &apos;m sorry , the song &apos;s over .
did you see me up there ?
every little bit of you .
i can &apos;t believe i sang in front of people and they liked me .
did you hear that guy shouting , &quot; look at those tips &quot; ?
i mean , did i really help you get a lot of tips ?
sure .
mon , not that you didn &apos;t sound good ..
good ?
didn &apos;t you hear them ? i was great !
thank you so much for making me do this . that is the best gift ever .
also a good gift : underwear .
thank you so much for letting me do this .
public bathrooms freak me out . i can &apos;t even pee , let alone do anything else .
but what &apos;s great is you don &apos;t mind talking about it .
it is so amazing that i met you on the same day that eric broke up with me ..
because it &apos;s like , you lose a boyfriend , and you get a boyfriend .
no , don &apos;t worry . this is not some rebound thing . i am totally over eric .
good choice , ross .
hey . hi . there you are .
i &apos;ve been looking for you everywhere .
hello . well , here i am .
my mom is not bringing the baby back until 9 : 00 .
so i was hoping you and i could have a chance to kind of ..
somebody here ?
oh , yeah . that &apos;s michelle .
who ?
oh , just this woman i &apos;ve been seeing .
you &apos;ve been seeing someone ?
yeah , didn &apos;t i mention that ?
i mean , we haven &apos;t been going out too long ..
but there &apos;s this amazing connection between us .
i mean , in fact just before you came in , she called me her boyfriend .
i thought it was a little too soon , but also , it felt kind of nice .
what are you taking amoxicillin for ?
how great is this ? you &apos;re already comfortable enough ..
to look through my stuff .
i &apos;m sorry , michelle , this is my roommate , rachel .
and i &apos;m also emma &apos;s mother .
who &apos;s emma ?
i told you about my daughter .
this is your daughter ?
i could be your new mommy .
and done .
oh , my god .
i didn &apos;t feel a thing . hey , are you still looking for a job ?
because you could tweeze circles around that sadistic bitch at the salon .
thanks . wanna see what it looks like ?
yeah .
they totally match . they look great .
they look great . how you doing ?
yeah , i think it looks pretty good . i was a little worried i was ..
uncovering a birthmark right about there ..
but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate .
chandler , thank you so much .
no problem .
listen , that was a pretty girlie hour we just spent .
we should do something manly to make up for it .
yeah .
curl my eyelashes .
yeah !
for my next song , i think i &apos;ll sing something a little more upbeat , all right ?
how about the pointer sisters &apos; &quot; i &apos;m so excited &quot; ?
and make it bouncy .
well , you can probably take care of that on your end .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late . you &apos;ll understand when you see joey .
honey , you &apos;re just in time . i &apos;m about to sing another song .
really ? in front of all these people ?
and they love me .
oh , my god .
she gives the people what they want .
all right , watch .
are those my wife &apos;s nipples ?
isn &apos;t that funny ? i didn &apos;t see that before . i wouldn &apos;t have let her go up again .
i &apos;ve gotta stop this .
who cares ? they still love me .
you , touching yourself ! out !
wow ! she does that a lot .
ross , you didn &apos;t tell me you were a doctor .
wait a minute . you haven &apos;t even told her you are a doctor yet ?
how long have you known her , like an hour ?
actually , about an hour and a half .
i told you it wasn &apos;t long , but there &apos;s an amazing connection between us .
you feel that too ?
i thought that that was just me .
are you kidding ?
do you wanna go away this weekend ?
we &apos;ll see .
ross , what &apos;s going on here ?
are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now ?
i don &apos;t know . are we just kissing guys on balconies ?
how do you know about that ?
through the magic of sight .
i was here , putting our child to sleep ..
emma .
when i looked through the window and saw you kissing a guy ..
you &apos;ve known for what , a week ?
god , is that what this is all about ? you bring her up here to get back at me ?
no , actually , see , i had to pee because i can &apos;t use public bathrooms ..
because of the doody parasites .
okay , michelle , it &apos;s time to go .
well , call me .
okay .
wait , you don &apos;t have my phone number .
you know what ? if it &apos;s meant to be , i &apos;ll guess it .
bye @-@ bye .
score .
did you not like her ? because i was hoping we could come ..
to your kissing parties on the balcony .
i can &apos;t believe you are making a big deal about this . it was one kiss !
one guy . one time !
oh , really ?
yeah .
oh , really ?
oh , yeah .
what about the guy from the bar ?
who ?
the guy you gave your number to .
how do you know about that ?
because he called here looking for you .
so don &apos;t tell me kissing this guy from work is a one @-@ time thing .
because you &apos;ve been out there in bars and on balconies ..
for over a month now . and you don &apos;t even have the courtesy to tell me .
why didn &apos;t i get that message ?
what ?
from the guy in the bar ? why didn &apos;t i get that message ?
because i folded it up and put it in my pants pocket .
do you not look there ?
ross .
i never gave it to you .
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
oh , god , you know what ? i don &apos;t ..
who do you think you are ? who are you to decide ..
what messages i should or should not get ? !
who am i ? i &apos;m the guy who &apos;s taking care of our baby ..
while you &apos;re at bars meeting guys !
i cannot believe you .
i actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you about us .
but i can &apos;t do that with someone who hides my messages ..
and brings crazy women back to my apartment !
hey , none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me !
that &apos;s not the point , okay ? the point is ..
you are the one who moved on and didn &apos;t tell anyone .
oh , god , ross , this is just so messed up .
what is wrong with us ? when people hear about our situation , they ask :
&quot; you live together , but you &apos;re not a couple , yet you have a baby ?
isn &apos;t that weird ? &quot; and i say , &quot; no . it &apos;s not , because it works for us . &quot;
but you know what ? this doesn &apos;t work .
in fact , this is the opposite of working .
clearly .
and you know ..
we said that we would live together as long as this makes sense ..
and maybe this just doesn &apos;t make sense anymore .
yeah , maybe not .
so , what do you wanna do ?
hi .
can emma and i live here for a while ?
god .
of course .
thank you .
your eyebrows look weird .
