Easy.
Sorry.
Careful.
Careful.
Fairy dust is the most...
precious substance in all the land.
Its magic is what powers the world.
This is the year's supply.
We must be cautious.
I know.
Because next year, you'll be doing this alone.
I-I'll still be picking up dust?
I thought I'd be a fairy godmother by then.
Oh, Nova.
You really are a dreamer.
Your journey is just beginning.
Can you make it home from the mines with all the dust safe?
Okay.
This one's ready.
No, it's too early, Watchy.
This unit isn't scheduled to hatch till sundown.
Well, someone's eager to get out before the rest of his brothers.
Welcome to the world, dwarf.
Uh, excuse me, Leroy.
Uh, do you mind scooting over a seat
so Walter and I could sit together?
If I wanted to sit there, I would've sat there.
You want this seat, try dragging your sorry asses
out of bed a little earlier.
You're a real ray of sunshine as--
Congrats.
Just lost my appetite.
Seat's all yours.
Excuse me.
Can I have everyone's attention, please?
I'm sorry to interrupt your morning,
but I just wanted to remind everyone
that a very special occasion is upon us--
Miners Day.
As always, the nuns of Storybrooke
are hoping that everyone will get involved
and will help sell their exquisite candles.
All we need are a few energetic volunteers.
So who wants to join me?
Leroy, you wanna volunteer?
I want to leave, sister. You're blocking the door.
Of course.
Uh, you know, if you wanted to help, it could really be a--
Oh, yeah. Right.
Quite a team we'd make.
Town harlot, town drunk.
The only person in this town that people like less than me
is you.
If you're coming to me, you're screwed.
Hey, mind if I join you?
So what the hell is Miners Day,
and why are you beating yourself up over it?
It's an annual holiday celebrating an old tradition.
The nuns used to make candles
and trade them with the miners for coal.
Coal? In Maine?
If they were mining for lobster, I'd understand.
Look, I don't know. Now they use it as a fund-raiser.
It's an amazing party.
Everyone loves it.
It doesn't seem like everyone loves it.
It's not Miners Day.
It's me.
Last week, I had ten volunteers. This week, they all dropped out.
You think this is about what happened with David?
Oh, I know it is.
A few of them told me as much.
I've never...
been a homewrecker before.
It's gonna blow over.
You made a mistake with David. It happens.
But you don't have to do charity
to try to win people's hearts back.
I have to do something.
And this is the best I can do.
Love ruined my life.
Sheriff Swan.
Yeah. I'll be right down.
Well, apparently, duty calls.
Hang in there.
And if there's anything I can do to help, I will.
I know. Thank you.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
It just slipped out of my hand. I--
No problem at all.
I really am so sorry.
I was so busy trying to get the lights to work
that I didn't realize
I was about to knock it off the ladder.
Let me take a look at those lights for ya.
Here's your problem.
You're overloading the transformer.
You kept messing around with these lights,
the whole thing could've blown up on you.
Then I guess that makes you my hero.
I'm nobody's hero, sister.
You can just call me Astrid.
I call everybody "sister."
I'm Leroy.
How did you do that?
Are you an electrician?
I'm in the custodial services game.
That's... wonderful.
No, it's not.
What I really wanted to do...
was sail.
I even bought a boat.
It's a real clunker. I was gonna fix it up,
sail around the world, say good-bye to this hellhole.
Oh, I'm sorry, sister.
It's okay.
You know, someone once told me
you can do anything as long as you can dream it.
You really think so?
Sure.
Look how easily you fixed those lights.
I bet you could do anything.
I should, uh, get back to the volunteer center.
Nice to meet you, Leroy.
You mind if I take a look, too?
What for?
Well, just because I got fired from the "Mirror"
doesn't mean I can't do a little freelance reporting.
So what do we got here?
Gym teacher found this thing on the side of the road, abandoned,
engine running, no one around.
Registered to Kathryn Nolan.
She's M.I.A.
Kathryn Nolan,
whose husband very publicly left her?
I mean, the story writes itself.
If I get a scoop like that,
the "Daily Mirror" would have no choice but to take me back.
Calm down, tiger. You don't work for Regina anymore.
Kathryn got accepted to law school in Boston.
Maybe after David dumped her, she decided to leave town.
Car broke down. She hitched the rest of the way.
That's what I would do if I was running away from my problems.
And, uh, would you leave your clothes in the car?
Time to pull Kathryn's phone records
and find out who she spoke to last.
Yeah, you know, if you go through the sheriff's department
it'll take you days to get those.
I've got a contact over at the phone company
who used to help me ot when I was at the newspaper.
I can get those in a couple hours.
Great.
Call me the minute you get your hands on those phone records.
There he is.
Time to break the news.
You really think he doesn't know?
I'm about to find out.
Arms up.
What am I?
You're a dwarf.
What am I doing?
Being cleaned.
Who is the woman I saw?
What woman?
The one I saw right before I hatched.
She was beautiful. I want to see her again.
Ha! You must be dreaming.
There are no female dwarfs.
Dwarfs don't fall in love,
dwarfs don't get married,
and dwarfs don't have children.
Why do you think you were hatched from an egg?
Then what do we do?
We work.
And we like it?
We love it. We even whistle while we do it.
We mine the diamonds that get crushed into dust
that give light to the world.
You and your seven brethren
will bring joy to yourselves and to everyone.
Come on.
This is your team. These are your brothers.
Everyone, grab an ax.
It'll give you your dwarf name.
The ax never lies, Dreamy.
Okay, folks, grab a lantern and move out.
Today is the first day of the rest of your lives.
Welcome to the mines!
Where can I sign up?
What?
I want to volunteer to sell candles.
No, you don't.
You made that very clear this morning at Granny's.
Maybe I saw the light.
I mean, maybe somebody showed it to me.
What difference does it make, sister?
It looks like you can use all the help you can get.
Okay, I need help manning the candle booth.
No swearing, no drinking,
and I get to call all the shots.
You ordered how many tanks of helium?
I meant to order 12.
You ordered 12 dozen.
Return them.
There are no refunds.
We needed that money. You knew that.
You know how he feels about us.
You fix this, Sister Astrid. You fix it now.
Hey.
What's the problem?
The problem is I'm an idiot.
We get a stipend each year for expenses,
and it's all carefully budgeted
except for the part where I spent it all on helium.
And now we can't pay our rent.
So you'll make it up
when you get your next stipend.
Which isn't till next month.
The rent is due next week.
And the only income we have are these candles.
Well, so how many do you need to sell?
Like, a thousand.
How many did you sell last year?
42.
Ask your landlord to cut you a break.
Oh. Mr. Gold doesn't offer much leeway.
Mr. Gold's your landlord?
If we miss a payment, we're out.
And then they'll reassign us,
and we'll have to leave Storybrooke.
No, you won't.
You know why you only sold 42 last year?
Because you didn't have me.
This year we're going to sell all of them.
Leroy,
I guess you really are my hero.
She's just gone?
You really don't know anything, do you?
I-I don't-- I don't understand.
Wh-what happened?
I don't know. I'm trying to find out.
What can you tell me?
When was the last time you spoke to Kathryn?
Yesterday afternoon.
Okay, look, I know there has been lies
and deceit,
and I'm really not judging you,
but is that the truth?
Yes. I haven't spoken to her since we...
I ended things.
And I came home yesterday, and all her things were gone.
I assumed she was going to Boston.
That's what she told me.
Am I a suspect or something?
No. I know when people are telling the truth, David,
and you are.
She hasn't even been gone 24 hours.
She's not even technically missing.
But if she is, trust me,
I will find her.
Hello, Sidney?
Those phone records you wanted--
I have them.
And I think you'll find them quite helpful.
Come on.
Help!
Someone!
Oh, thank you.
It's you.
Do we... know each other?
You're the woman I saw in my dreams
right before I hatched last year.
You're 1?
I know. I look young for my age.
Oh, no!
The Fairy Dust!
I'm an idiot.
All I ever wanted to be was a fairy godmother.
That was my dream,
but I can't even pick up Fairy Dust alone.
I'm so clumsy.
No, you're not.
I think you'd make a great fairy godmother.
You really think so?
I believe you can do anything you want,
as long as you can dream it.
I'm Nova.
I'm Dreamy.
You know, Dreamy, as fairies,
we get to spend very little time in your world,
and I was thinking about making a stop on my way back.
Have you ever been to see the fireflies?
I barely ever get out of the mines.
Oh, I-I-I heard it's beautiful,
that they come out just after sunset on Firefly Hill.
I was going to see them tonight on my way back.
Oh, sounds fun.
Have a good time.
Dreamy?
Thanks.
You're my hero.
Buy your Miners Day candles here!
Handmade by Storybrooke's very own nuns!
Light your way to a good cause
by buying a candle.
This isn't working.
You're right. We should pack it up.
Now you're quitting?
If the customers won't come to us,
we gotta go to them,
door to door.
If they hate us here,
what makes you think they'll like us in their homes?
Exactly. They'll pay us just to leave.
What the hell are you doing?
What's happening?
I just got off the phone with Kathryn's school in Boston.
Registration was this morning, and she never showed up.
Something did happen.
It looks that way.
Oh, Emma, help me out! What's more sympathetic--
scarf or no scarf?
S-scarf.
Okay.
Come on. We're on a schedule.
Thank you. Gotta go.
Why didn't you say anything?
You're looking for a suspect, someone with a motive.
Pixie cut over there has got one a mile high.
She had nothing to do with anything.
Trust me.
But she's the one--
Trust me. I know her.
Just get me those phone records.
Hi. We're selling candles for Miners Day.
We're not interested.
What's the matter?
You've barely touched your food.
I don't know.
I can't eat. I can't sleep.
I don't feel at all like myself.
Maybe I should have Doc take a look at me.
You're gonna trust a dwarf
that got his medical degree from a pickax?
I wouldn't worry about it. Dwarves don't get sick.
It must be in your head.
It's not in his head. It's in his heart.
You're in love.
Oh, that's impossible.
Dwarves can't fall in love.
Trust me.
I know love, and...
you're in it.
What's it like?
It's the most wonderful and amazing thing in the world.
Love is hope.
It fuels our dreams.
And if you're in it,
you need to enjoy it,
because love doesn't always last forever.
But if love's so great,
then why do I feel so bad right now?
You need to be with the person you love.
Yeah, but how do I know she feels the same way?
All she talked about was going to see some fireflies,
not loving me.
What--what did she tell you about these fireflies?
Uh, that she was gonna go see them on the hilltop tonight,
that she heard they were the most beautiful sight in all the land.
What?
She wasn't telling you about the fireflies.
She was inviting you to go be with her.
You think so?
I've had my heart broken enough
to know when somebody's reaching out.
Now go. Find your love.
Find your hope.
Find your dreams.
Sister Astrid?
Hi.
I have to talk to you.
See, I have some bad news.
Oh, no.
What is it?
The bad news is that...
that...
you nuns are gonna be real busy making candles,
'cause me and Mary Margaret just sold them all.
You're not losing the convent. You're not going anywhere.
How could you tell Astrid
that we sold all those candles? That is $5,000, Leroy.
$5,000 that we don't have.
Don't worry about it, all right?
I got a plan.
What plan? A plan like going door to door
and having everyone in town laugh in our faces?
Just give me till the end of the day.
I'll figure something out.
And why is this so important to you?
The nuns...
They're gonna have to leave. Hmm.
Oh, my god.
You like her.
She is a nun, Leroy.
Could you possibly pick anyone any less available?
Says the girl who went after a married guy?
At the end of the day, you're no better than I am.
You got your reasons for being here.
I got mine.
And when I say I'm gonna get that $5,000,
I'm gonna get that $5,000.
I didn't think you were gonna show up.
I was afraid I was too late.
Well, you did cut it pretty close.
Come on.
Look at all those lights.
Are those the fireflies?
No!
That's the village.
And beyond that, all the lights of the kingdom.
You've seen a lot of this world, haven't you?
From a distance, yes.
What's wrong with that?
Flying over the world and being a part of it
aren't exactly the same thing.
Well, at least you've seen the world.
Me--I live in the mines, underground.
All I ever see is diamonds and dirt and dwarves.
You know...
We could see it together.
Get a boat, sail all over,
explore everything the world has to offer.
Oh! Look!
Okay, let's do it.
Tomorrow night, after I drop off the dust,
let's meet back here.
We'll run off together.
We'll see the world.
Sounds like a dream come true.
Now I know it's a bit of a fixer-upper.
Could probably use a new coat of paint,
a few spritzes of febreze here and there.
But you can't tell me
That $5,000's not a reasonable price for this beauty.
$3,000, I think.
I need $5,000.
You need $5,000.
To what do we owe this specificity?
Trying to help out a friend.
Oh, I see.
Look, you don't even have to pay me anything.
Just forgive one month's rent for the nuns.
The nuns?
You can have the boat. They'll pay you back eventually.
It's a good deal. You get everything.
So that's what this is about.
Come on. You're a rich guy. You can afford to give them time
to make up one month's, right?
You're right. I could.
So great.
But I won't.
I have a fairly specific rental agreement.
If they miss a payment, I'm within my rights to evict.
Oh, come on. Why would you--
And quite honestly,
it's gonna be a great relief
to be rid of such distasteful tenants.
You don't like nuns?
Who doesn't like nuns?
Oh, I have my reasons.
And they're mine.
Let's just say I have a long and complicated history with them,
and leave it at that.
Hello?
Astrid.
Mary Margaret said I might find you down here.
I... I made you a pie.
It's the least I could do after all your help.
Wow.
Oh, this boat is great!
It's gonna be amazing when you get it out on the water.
I can't even remember the last time I was on it.
Wh-what's this?
If you sold all the candles,
why are they still here, Leroy?
I didn't sell them all.
I tried to, but nobody wanted to buy them from me.
I was gonna tell you the truth,
but I was afraid of letting you down.
So you lied.
I'm sorry, Astrid.
I guess you believed in the wrong guy.
You find something?
Kathryn's phone records.
Every call she made the day she crashed her car,
including an 8-minute call between her and David
within an hour of the accident.
That's not possible.
He said he didn't speak to her that day.
Then he's lying.
No. I know when someone is lying, and David--
It's right here on paper, Emma.
Phone records don't lie. People do.
And our friend David does it better than most.
Don't beat yourself up over this.
You're not the only person David fooled.
I'll have what she's having.
Well?
Did you get it?
What do you think?
I think you're right.
I was dreaming if I thought that the Town Harlot
And the Town Drunk could accomplish anything.
Yeah.
Just dreamin'.
Ahahem.
Stealthy.
You know, if you wanted to sneak out, you should've come to me.
You're leaving us? Without even saying good-bye?
But--but where you going?
To be with Nova.
We're in love. We're gonna see the world together.
I don't understand.
I thought we were meant to live our lives here, in the mines.
I thought so, too,
but things change when you fall in love.
Suddenly anything seems possible.
Well, take this with you.
It might come in handy.
I don't need it anymore.
You can't do this, Dreamy.
You can't go to her.
Why not?
You have a responsibility--
to mine the diamonds we make into fairy dust.
But I love her.
You're a dwarf, Dreamy.
We're not capable of love.
It's not how we're made.
What if I'm different?
What if you're wrong?
Bossy's not wrong, young one.
What you feel--
it's just a dream.
Who are you?
I'm Nova's teacher.
And if the two of you run away together, it will not end well.
Nova will lose her wings.
But if you return to the mines
and if you allow Nova
to become the fairy that she was meant to be,
the two of you will bring untold joy to the world.
Nova can be a great fairy...
if you let her.
The choice is yours.
Leroy,
you understand that a relationship
between you and Sister Astrid can never happen.
Yeah. Yeah.
My whole life people made it their business
to tell me what I can't do.
She was the first person that said I could do anything,
who believed in me.
I didn't want to disappoint her.
But there are consequences to following through
when the world tells you not to.
I mean, look at me.
I am a pariah in this town.
What about your good memories?
What do you mean?
Didn't you have moments with him that you love?
Do you regret them?
No, of course not.
Isn't that what life's about?
Holding on to your good memories.
All I wanted was a moment with Astrid--
one moment to give me hope that any dream's possible.
You've had all that, Mary Margaret,
so stop feeling sorry for yourself and enjoy it.
Because I haven't.
Well, if I had the dream,
I m sorry to say it wasn't worth it.
And sitting here drinking won't end this pain.
What will?
I can only think of one thing.
Perfect.
Leroy!
What are you doing?!
Please don't do it.
I'm not gonna jump.
You're not?
No. Are you crazy?
I could hit someone.
You know how much damage I could do?
I'm solidly built.
Leroy, what are you doing up here?
I'm gonna get my moment.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?
You might wanna duck.
What are you doing?
I'm selling candles, sister.
Dreamy, come on. I have to show you something.
Nova, we need to talk.
No. You have to see this.
Take a look.
It's amazing.
It has everything we need to explore the world--
supplies, maps of all the kingdoms, a sturdy sail.
Nova.
I can't go with you.
What about our life together?
Our dream?
I'm a dwarf, Nova.
I belong in the mines.
You belong with the other fairies,
and that's never gonna change.
Dreamy.
You control what changes in your life.
Never let yourself forget--
you're special.
Why?
What makes us different from any other dwarf or fairy out there?
Our love.
I don't think it's love.
It's a dream. We need to put it away.
I don't want to put it away.
I'm not your dream, Nova.
Your dream's to be a fairy godmother,
and you can still be that.
You talked to the Blue Fairy.
It doesn't matter.
What did she say?
It doesn't matter.
What did she say?!
Nova!
What matters is...
I can't stand in the way of your happiness.
But you're my happiness.
I love you.
Don't you love me?
I'm a dwarf.
I can't love.
Let's pick up the pace, boys!
We're making magic here!
Where's my ax?
Where's my ax?
Dreamy, you're...
back!
Well, heigh-ho, boys!
Good to have you back, Dreamy.
No place I'd rather be.
Heigh-ho.
Bossy.
Hand me another ax.
Here you are, Dreamy.
It's "Grumpy" now.
Here you go.
Leroy.
We sold out.
Well, go on.
Give her the news.
Have your moment.
Excuse me.
Okay.
5,000 bucks.
Piece of cake.
You sold them all?
I had a little help.
You made it happen.
You have no idea.
I don't know what to say.
You're welcome.
Listen, that boat of mine?
I'm gonna fix it up.
And, well,
maybe you could be my first passenger.
I'd like that.
Well, then that's what we'll do, sister.
Oh. It's beautiful, isn't it?
If this is about the blackout,
I've got the guys from the power company
down there working on it.
That's not why I'm here.
It's been 24 hours
since my friend kathryn went missing.
Have you found anything?
I found something. I just don't know what it means.
Well, what is it?
At this point in the investigation,
it's best I don't divulge that information.
If you're covering for someone,
if you're not doing your job, Sheriff Swan,
I'll find someone who will.
Emma.
David, we need to talk.
Did you get ahold of Kathryn?
No, I'm afraid not.
Then what is it?
I need you to come to the sheriff's station with me
and tell me everything.
I'm sorry. I thought I already did.
So did I.
