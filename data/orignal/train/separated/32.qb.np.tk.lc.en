the transmitter is to be worn around your ankle at all times .
you &apos;re confined to the apartment 24 hours a day .
it must not cross this line .
your condition is your defense .
there is no condition !
i &apos;ll be damned if i &apos;m going to have people think
that jonas stern is losing his mind .
you &apos;ve done wrong .
i know i have .
your marriage is in trouble
because you don &apos;t acknowledge true repentance .
tell me what i have to do .
i &apos;m going to take a third of your business ,
and then i &apos;m coming back for the rest .
at 5 : 16 p.m. on september 5 , the explosion hit .
it was felt over four blocks away .
federal investigators determined it was a pipe bomb
consisting of ammonium nitrate and anhydrous hydrazine nitrate ,
which had been thrown through the window of the newsroom layout office .
no culprits were ever apprehended ,
and the federal government continues to investigate .
the explosion killed the plaintiff
mr. jeffrey sanborn , 42,
managing editor of the cook county vindicator &quot;
exception .
resulted in his death .
uh , noted and accepted .
replacing &quot; killed . &quot;
mr. sanborn is married
and has two teenaged dependents who will suffer
from loss of wages and affection .
mr. clay and the cook county vindicator ,
jointly and severally , agree to pay ... uh , julius ?
$ 250,000 from capped business insurance
and $ 100,000 from capped renter &apos;s insurance
but only if we agree now .
we agree .
mrs. sanborn ?
mrs. sanborn ?
the man you &apos;re discussing--
my husband--
he was working on a novel .
i just started reading it .
it &apos;s ... beautiful .
and you &apos;re telling me
that he &apos;s worth $ 350,000 ?
mrs. sanborn , no money could ever replace your husband ,
but the only way we can talk here is about money .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ve been reading a lot of books about grief ,
and they all suggest waiting six months
before you make any big changes in your life .
well , jeffrey died exactly six months ago this week , so ...
you &apos;re fired ...
and you are , too .
mrs. sanborn , if you do this , we have to start over ,
and you may not get a better settlement from our client .
i think i will .
why ?
why do you think that ?
because i just hired a new lawyer .
jeanette !
oh , how i missed you , baby doll .
ah , good to see you .
hey , get out of this hellhole , come work for a real law firm .
i have arrived .
mr. stern , thank you for joining us .
mrs. sanborn , it is an extreme and unconditional pleasure .
hello , julius .
i see you haven &apos;t taken down the &quot; s &quot; yet .
we &apos;re looking for a new stern .
coffee , two sugars .
thanks .
how about you three ? anybody want coffee ?
ah , it &apos;ll just be one coffee .
how are you feeling , mr. stern ?
how am i feeling , huh ?
well , i &apos;m feeling like amending a complaint .
how does that sound ?
jonas ,
the insurance has been capped at $ 350,000 .
the newspaper can &apos;t pay any more .
unless it was an intentional act .
intentional act opens you up to punitive damages .
i love when she talks like that .
it sounds so good coming from a young person .
how is it an intentional act ?
your client published an editorial cartoon which depicts
the prophet muhammad being humiliated .
being body scanned at an airport metal detector .
and while all the other white passengers are waved through .
it was intended to criticize racial profiling .
all the while , your client knew
that islam prohibits any pictorial depiction of the prophet ,
and he cut back on security
at the exact moment he should have increased it .
a cost @-@ cutting measure .
read the settlement , jonas .
you know what happened in denmark
when the morning post published cartoons just like this .
riots , death threats .
this isn &apos;t about mrs. sanborn , jonas .
this is about us .
of course it &apos;s about us .
i &apos;m going to destroy your firm .
and mrs. sanborn understands that , don &apos;t you , dear ?
i do .
how much are you suing for ?
didn &apos;t i ask for coffee ?
how much in punitive ?
$ 25 million .
here &apos;s the amended suit .
mrs. florrick .
may i have a moment ?
how am i feeling ?
it was an innocent question .
attorney @-@ client privilege .
what you know about me ,
what you know about my condition
is for us to know and no one else .
you do understand that ?
oh , there it is again .
that poker face .
you know , i always thought the cia could learn something
from the suburban housewife . do you understand ?
i understand the obligations of my job .
good .
oh , has your friend will gardner stabbed you in the back yet ?
would you like me to get him on the phone for you ? you can ask .
ask him who he &apos;s meeting with right now .
or does the name gerald kozko mean anything to you ?
he &apos;s a real estate developer .
underwater ,
and unless i &apos;m mistaken , his name keeps coming up
in connection with your husband &apos;s case .
always a pleasure , mrs. florrick .
well , it &apos;s never about the money .
it &apos;s always about something else .
well , i &apos;m sorry we can &apos;t help .
take care .
mrs. florrick .
mister ... ?
kozko , gerald .
we &apos;ve never met .
how &apos;s peter ?
fine .
i didn &apos;t know you knew will .
i don &apos;t , i was shopping for more lawyers to join my defense team ,
but it appears we have a conflict of interest--
you .
anyway , glad to meet you .
peter always said he was a lucky guy .
now i see why .
would you tell peter something for me ?
tell him i &apos;m sorry .
for ?
he &apos;ll know what i mean .
my great grandfater lucius clay founded the vindicator .
in his first editorial he endorsed abraham lincoln .
in his last he railed against prohibition .
the trib and the sun @-@ times may be bigger ,
but they have to answer to corporate ownership .
dumbwaiters .
lucius set them up to shuttle in the booze .
and so we gladly admit that
we have committed this attack upon the blasphemous ,
who published this cartoon ,
to defend the honor of all muslims and of allah &apos;s beloved prophet .
peace be upon him .
yes , i &apos;ve seen this .
how does it hurt us ?
the plaintiff says it &apos;s no secret this group &apos;s been active in chicago .
six months earlier ,
they committed an identical bombing at a synagogue .
and you had to know that cartoon might provoke them .
my job is to provoke .
because it sells papers ?
because freedom of the press is meaningless
unless somebody actually uses it .
i &apos;m not trying to be insensitive .
jeff sanborn was a very good friend .
we came up together .
the problem , mr. clay , is their argument is ,
you did it to increase circulation .
it &apos;s not like i commissioned this cartoon ,
hoping it was going to anger muslims .
we had an online contest--
best political cartoon , any subject .
and you picked the cartoon ?
in consultation with my editors .
jeffrey sanborn , too ?
sure , of course .
so , even if stern can show he intended this to happen ,
sanborn was contributorily negligent .
might not be a total win ,
but it &apos;s enough to get us back to the table .
we &apos;ll need something more than mr. clay &apos;s testimony to establish it .
what about the cartoonist ?
it was an anonymous submission .
i sent the money to a paypal account .
routed through a proxy .
there &apos;s no way to trace it .
we &apos;ll see . i &apos;ll get kalinda on it .
returning to the scene of the crime ?
you &apos;re not going to pout , are you ?
i hate when men pout .
go away .
okay , let &apos;s inspect the level of coincidence here .
i haven &apos;t seen you since college .
we bump into each other here .
you ask me what i &apos;m doing .
i talk about the muhammad cartoon case ,
and then the next day-- lo and behold--
you and your firm are suing my client .
cary , think about it .
if i let slip a piece of information like that to you ,
you &apos;d be on the phone to your boss before our second drink .
okay .
then your turn .
what &apos;s going on at work ?
okay , i &apos;ll play .
stern wants you .
stern wants me ?
last night you wanted me , now he wants me .
lockhart , gardner is going under .
it &apos;s a hollowed @-@ out shell .
because stern keeps taking our clients .
in one year ,
your firm will be nothing but an empty floor in an office building .
stern &apos;s got equity , plenty of business ,
and one more thing , no contest .
that &apos;s right , your little contest with mrs. florrick .
you &apos;re losing .
i got more billable hours .
and florrick &apos;s got a name .
stern is new .
there &apos;s a better path to partnership .
think about it .
you won &apos;t be alone .
oh , i won &apos;t be alone ?
in leaving lockhart , gardner .
you &apos;re raiding us ?
mm @-@ hmm .
so where are we on getting me to church ?
i &apos;m filing a religious exception to electronic monitoring .
it doesn &apos;t always work , but we &apos;ll hope for the best .
maybe next sunday .
and i am getting a photographer at the church .
i don &apos;t care what the good pastor has to say .
eli , we &apos;re not doing that .
what is it ? what &apos;s the mater ?
well , it &apos;s ... probably nothing .
um , childs is changing the direction with the retrial .
he &apos;s giving up the sex angle .
that &apos;s all he &apos;s got .
is he changing the trial date ?
no . two months away .
i don &apos;t understand , then .
i am hearing chatter about a surprise witness .
so who can hurt you ?
well , if they &apos;re going to lie ,
anybody can hurt me .
maybe childs is trying to quietly make this disappear .
i doubt it .
hey , hon .
gerald kozko was at my office today .
he wanted me to tell you something .
he said , &quot; tell peter i &apos;m sorry &quot;
damn .
no . kozko and childs hate each other .
there &apos;s no way he &apos;s going to grant him immunity .
well , he would if it &apos;s the only way to get peter .
we need ...
you &apos;re standing in my kitchen .
whatever you have to say , you can say it in front of me .
you heard her .
mrs. sanborn ,
did your husband have a close relationship with his employer ?
mr. clay ?
yes . until recently .
it had become strained-- their friendship .
and why was that ?
objection . beyond the scope .
well , i really think we &apos;re safe here .
don &apos;t you ?
you may answer , mrs. sanborn .
the paper was in financial trouble .
they had to lay off a lot of staff .
the stress took its toll .
jeff was also frustrated by mr. clay &apos;s pursuit
of a new yorker cover .
something controversial .
like the obama fist @-@ bump cartoon on the new yorker .
something that would increase readership .
well , mrs. sanborn , did your husband help
mr. clay choose the cartoon for publication in the paper ?
yes .
it was a contest , and he helped mr. clay judge it .
but the cartoon that appeared was different , wasn &apos;t it ?
yes .
i saw the original .
it didn &apos;t depict muhammad .
it was just a middle @-@ eastern man .
jeffrey told me
that the decision to change it to muhammad was mr. clay &apos;s .
to generate more controversy .
is it just me ,
or do we really need to find that cartoonist ?
so , here &apos;s your cartoon .
now , you see this cross @-@ hatching ?
how it almost looks like bars ?
that can indicate a sense of suffocation .
like they can &apos;t say what they mean .
in this case , it might indicate
someone who &apos;s a muslim themselves .
fascinating .
yeah .
does this really work ?
graphology ?
applied to drawing .
it does if you know what you &apos;re looking for .
you don &apos;t respect my job , do you ?
i am ... incredulous .
it &apos;s best with comparison .
you run an image search , cross @-@ referenced
with the unique elements of the sample drawing .
still too much .
narrow it by location .
chicago .
better .
looks like i am a believer .
the thing is , when you hired me ,
i was told the firm had a program
for lending associates money against our salaries--
for down payments , cars .
accounting turned you down ?
yeah .
and i got my eye on a condo in lincoln park .
interest rates are still low .
look , money &apos;s a little tight these days , that &apos;s all .
yeah , i just want to know
if there &apos;s anything i should be aware of .
about my future .
about your ... ?
no .
nobody &apos;s trying to tell you anything .
it &apos;s just money &apos;s tight .
so i &apos;m still in the running ?
you are .
nobody &apos;s made any decisions yet .
is that it ?
yes .
so how &apos;s peter doing ?
he &apos;s good . i mean , he &apos;d be a lot better
if he had a clearer sense of what childs was planning .
so , he got the message ?
my apology ?
yeah .
look , you and peter go back a long way .
if childs is threatening you ,
peter wants to help his friends in any way he can .
well , i don &apos;t want to hurt peter .
but it &apos;s not just me .
i have a legacy to protect .
my son .
peter has a family , too .
we all have families .
okay , let &apos;s cut the pleasantries .
whatever you have ,
or think you can devise , to hurt peter--
he has twice as much to hurt you .
i know your reputation , mr. gold .
then you know i don &apos;t screw around .
i know peter has religion .
meaning ?
he &apos;s off his game .
you have a pastor giving him spiritual instruction .
now he &apos;s going to church .
hey , i &apos;m in risk assessment , mr. gold .
at the moment , childs is the bigger risk .
did he give you immunity ?
oh , that &apos;s not good .
not at all .
we don &apos;t threaten with a subpoena
unless he refuses to testify .
how about we don &apos;t threaten at all ?
yes ?
mrs. bassir ?
dr. bassir . may i help you ?
oh , so sorry . yes , of course .
um , is your husband home ?
my husband ?
my husband doesn &apos;t live in this country .
is there a tarik bassir here ?
a cartoonist ?
yeah , that &apos;s me .
what &apos;s up ?
yeah , it was my idea .
some jerk at the airport gave me a hard time ,
so i drew about it .
first i made it just a picture of a random muslim .
then i thought-- what the hell ?
language .
i mean , if i &apos;m going to make a statement ,
why not really make a statement , you know ?
so it was your idea to depict ...
the prophet .
yeah . somebody has to do something or the fundies win .
fundamentalists .
i e @-@ mailed clay ,
told him i wanted to change the cartoon .
put it out in the open , get other muslims
to reexamine their preconceptions .
then why do it anonymously ?
hey , i &apos;m 15 years old .
why do i do anything ?
you have to understand--
i knew nothing about any of this .
not until after .
and would you be willing to testify about all of this , tarik ?
that &apos;s not up to tarik .
well , he could testify in camera--in the judge &apos;s chambers .
there would only be the judge , the lawyers , the court reporters .
we would use a pseudonym .
mrs. florrick , miss sharma ,
i know the name of only one cartoonist .
kurt westergaard ,
the man who drew one of the cartoons of muhammad
in the danish paper five years ago .
and he has been living
under 24 @-@ hour security since then .
i will not do that to my son .
you explained he could testify in camera ?
yes . she doesn &apos;t want to take a chance .
well , if she doesn &apos;t produce him ,
she &apos;ll be held in contempt .
no .
uh , we need him .
he is the only one who can corroborate
the cartoon was his idea , not yours .
i already have jeff sanborn &apos;s blood on my hands .
i won &apos;t have this kid &apos;s .
this kid is all we have , charles .
if we don &apos;t use him , we need an alternate story for the jury .
counterterrorism unit just finished its preliminary bombing report .
maybe there &apos;s something we overlooked .
can you get your hands on it ?
i can try .
if i leave lockhart / gardner ,
i don &apos;t want it to be a dozen junior associates and me .
it won &apos;t be .
we &apos;ve got an equity partner .
ten associates .
you got an equity partner ?
there &apos;s a lot of unhappiness at lockhart / gardner .
which one ?
i like your hair messy .
don &apos;t comb it , okay ?
ten litigators , an unhappy equity partner .
it &apos;s julius , isn &apos;t it ?
he was always close to stern .
you are a smart boy .
he tried to poach you ?
stern did ?
yes .
and 11 others .
who ?
the only name i know is julius cain .
i don &apos;t want you to think for one moment
i was considering taking it .
of course not .
i &apos;m a team player .
i just want to do what &apos;s right for the firm .
thanks , cary .
yeah .
oh . i &apos;m working on your loan .
i think we can make it work .
thanks .
i really appreciate that .
yes , i was at the vindicator
when mr. clay made the decision to publish the cartoon .
and did you argue against it ?
i did .
i felt it was insensitive to muslim believers ,
especially when the same point could be made
without depicting muhammad .
you also argued that it was reckless .
i was the reporter on the synagogue bombing .
i saw the devastation that caused .
mr. thiessen , were you present when mr. clay met
with the vindicator lawyer prior to the publication of the cartoon ?
objection , your honor !
attorney @-@ client privilege .
mr. thiessen observed the conversation , your honor ,
and is not covered by the privilege .
that makes sense to me .
doesn &apos;t it , ms. lockhart ?
i &apos;ll allow .
what was said at this meeting ?
the lawyer referenced the new york times
and yale university press decision not to reprint the danish cartoon .
he believed , in both cases ,
the fear of inciting violence trumped the public &apos;s need to know .
thank you , sir .
mr. thiessen , you were worried
that the paper would be insensitive
to religious believers by printing the cartoon ?
yes .
i &apos;m not a muslim myself , but i can sympathize .
and what is this ?
&quot; piss christ . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry , i couldn &apos;t hear you .
&quot; piss ... christ . &quot;
yes , an artwork depicting a crucifix
placed in a cup of urine .
this photo illustrated an article of yours
on controversial art ?
my goodness .
why not the same sensitivity to religious believers ?
because that is unlikely to incite violence .
so , it &apos;s not about sensitivity , it &apos;s about fear ?
it &apos;s about both .
mm @-@ hmm . you were fired
from the vindicator , weren &apos;t you , mr. thiessen ,
as part of mr. clay &apos;s cost @-@ cutting ?
yes . but that has nothing to do with my testimony .
who are you ?
the plumber . who are you ?
i &apos;m jackie .
that means nothing to me .
peter &apos;s mother .
oh , yes , of course .
mrs. florrick . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m eli gold .
please , come on in .
you &apos;re not the plumber .
no .
i &apos;m peter &apos;s , uh , image consultant .
call me eli .
i like that brooch .
thank you . where &apos;s my son ?
he &apos;s just ...
he &apos;s meeting with his pastor .
his ...
pastor .
but please go in .
i &apos;m sure they &apos;d love to say hello .
yeah , it was good .
we had a guide and a porter .
and his sister was there .
they &apos;ve been meeting once a week for prayer ,
spiritual guidance ...
and the sharing of jesus christ .
who is that man ?
isaiah easton ,
pastor at lord in christ church .
on 95th ?
yes .
southside .
there is something in the fbi report .
the theory is that the bomb was tossed in through the window .
just like the synagogue .
yeah .
but all the windows were blown out by the force of the blast .
so ?
so there &apos;s no way to tell if the bomb was tossed in or not .
that &apos;s the blast site .
you remember what clay said ?
those dumbwaiters they used during prohibition to haul the liquor up--
they &apos;re all over the place .
so , this is the access to the office dumbwaiter .
well , the blast blew it apart .
it doesn &apos;t mean it went up this way .
what ? what is it ?
kalinda , words .
the bomb was hydrogen nitrate ,
a liquid explosive ,
and it stains concrete , not tile .
how do you know that ?
looked it up .
look .
the stain splattered here ... not here .
concrete , not tile .
well , it could have come down the shaft from the blast .
not in liquid form .
so , what are you saying ,
someone mixed the bomb here
and raised it ... on the dumbwaiter ?
i &apos;m not saying anything ; i &apos;m just staring at a stain .
but if the bomb was mixed here ...
we &apos;re talking about an inside job .
the blast blew apart the wall with the dumbwaiter ,
so there was no evidence that it was even there .
should i bring julius in on this ?
no , not yet . we &apos;ll update him later .
i still don &apos;t understand how the feds missed this .
well , my guess is , they didn &apos;t .
their investigation is still open .
they just didn &apos;t issue any of their findings .
and they won &apos;t until they catch whoever &apos;s responsible .
cary . come on in .
the question is , what does it mean ?
well , stern &apos;s theory is that clay wanted a violent backlash .
that rests on the fact that he cut back security .
yeah , but if the bomb came from inside ,
no security would &apos;ve been able to prevent it .
right .
stern will still argue that the bomb was planted by a radical islamic group .
they just had help from inside .
so talk to the employees .
that could help .
a lone bomber in the office .
how many muslim employees does he have ?
can &apos;t be many .
so we &apos;re going to racially profile ?
the exact thing the cartoon was against .
no . we &apos;re gonna step nicely past the ironies
and defend our client .
go over the employees for the last five years .
okay .
shall we ?
julius , can we talk to you for a second ?
what &apos;s that about ?
it &apos;s a betrayal .
it &apos;s a business decision .
what happened to loyalty ?
it exited the building the day you fired half of tax litigation .
look ...
i really didn &apos;t want it to get back to you this way ,
but , uh , it &apos;s no secret this place
is going through financial troubles .
half of which is stern &apos;s fault , julius .
there was trouble before stern started to take clients .
right now his firm seems more stable ,
and i consider him a mentor .
so do i.
but at the end of the day , i bet on myself , not him .
with stern , it &apos;s all about stern .
i &apos;m sorry .
julius .
you &apos;re one of the best lawyers we have .
you have a great client list .
so what &apos;s it gonna take ?
here &apos;s my offer from stern .
we can match it .
what about , uh , gearing up that diversity program we keep talking about ?
that &apos;ll cost us money we don &apos;t have .
we lag behind virtually every other major chicago firm
in diversity hiring .
i &apos;m tired of being the poster boy for affirmative action around here .
okay , fine .
we &apos;ll find the money .
all right .
now , it &apos;s your turn to do something for us .
ten other lawyers who were gonna go with you-- ...
... their names .
what , you want me to ...
but now they &apos;ll stay .
stern wanted me , not them .
we don &apos;t want turncoats with access to proprietary information .
you &apos;re gonna fire them .
it &apos;s more money for diversity hiring .
write down the names .
what is that ?
the results of my questioning the employees .
one received that the week before the attack .
tell me they didn &apos;t take this to clay .
they took it to clay .
and he ignored it ?
yes .
which makes it even worse that it was an inside job .
clay isn &apos;t liable for unforeseeable acts of his employees .
but now ? if he had prior notice ?
if we know this , stern knows this .
oh , well , that &apos;s a happy thought .
that &apos;s me , mr. cheer .
well , it makes clay &apos;s questioning tomorrow that much more important .
oh . which brings up another problem .
julius was handling questioning .
why is that a problem ?
maybe cary should take it .
no . alicia .
she can get in stern &apos;s face more effectively .
the fact is , you know something about stern no one else knows .
i can &apos;t use it , kalinda .
you can &apos;t not use it .
it violates attorney @-@ client privilege .
only if you tell someone , so don &apos;t tell someone .
all right , see you , then .
i want you to meet bishop grayson .
mom .
he &apos;s a nice episcopalian priest .
he will help you put this religion stuff into perspective .
it is in perspective .
that &apos;s not perspective .
this is about alicia , isn &apos;t it ?
no .
no , it &apos;s not . it &apos;s about me .
and i need a change .
no , you don &apos;t , peter .
you are a good man .
you want to blame yourself .
but you apologized .
you apologized again , and again .
anybody who wants another apology from you
only wants you to be weak .
so stop this .
stop this now .
my son will not be made weak .
you are one scary mom .
yes . and you are a good son .
mrs. sanborn stated under oath
that it was your decision to have the cartoon depict the prophet muhammad .
that &apos;s untrue .
the cartoonist contacted me with that idea .
still , it was your decision to run the cartoon , mr. clay .
why did you ?
&apos;cause it was newsworthy .
it wasn &apos;t sensational .
and this is america--
we can handle it .
thank you .
mr. clay ,
what is the naked columnist ?
an advice columnist in my paper
who supposedly answers questions in the nude .
and that is newsworthy .
that &apos;s not sensational .
it is not on the front page .
and this is america .
we can handle it .
the naked ... columnist .
there &apos;s room for entertainment in every paper .
a lot of room , apparently .
you devoted 10,000 column inches to the naked columnist last year .
do you know how many you devoted to iraq ?
i &apos;m battling internet competitors , sir .
competitors who are willing to give away their product for free .
mr. clay , are you aware that the police now believe
that this bombing was an inside job ?
objection ! not in evidence .
yes .
your honor , this is plaintiff &apos;s exhibit n--
the police report ... filed ... yesterday morning .
mr. clay , you don &apos;t know anything about this ,
do you ?
objection ! argumentative .
uh , your honor , it &apos;s a simple leading question .
overruled .
um , you may answer .
i &apos;m sorry , wh @-@ what was the question ?
the question was , uh ...
the police now believe that the bombing was an inside job ,
that the bomb was hoisted up
through a dumbwaiter .
objection ! again ,
not in evidence .
it is in the investigative report .
the investigative report merely states
that it appears a bomb was planted from inside .
it doesn &apos;t say anything specifically about dumbwaiters .
we ask that statement be stricken from the record .
is that really necessary , mrs. florrick ?
overruled .
thank you , your honor .
where was i ?
uh , right , right .
dumbwaiter , employees .
so , mr. clay ,
have any of the employees approached you about threats they might
have been receiv ... ?
objection . overly vague .
mrs. florrick .
you &apos;re right .
withdrawn , your honor .
you may proceed , mr. stern .
yes . thank you , your honor .
um ... one moment .
mr. stern ?
yes . just @-@ just one moment , please . thank you .
inside job . the threat . a threat .
mr. stern .
the documents .
no , no .
do you have any further questions for this witness ?
damn it , give me a minute !
i am sorry , your honor .
i ... i just , uh ...
i , um ...
i have nothing further .
thank you , mr. clay . you are dismissed .
please refrain from speaking with the jury
and make yourself available for further questions .
at this time ,
i suggest a , uh , a ten @-@ minute recess .
you don &apos;t at all understand .
we &apos;re still treating this like jihad even though it &apos;s an inside job .
because of the threat . the bomb ?
look .
you were talking about racial profiling , right ?
what if someone was using our bias to make us think it was jihad
when it was really something else ?
okay .
i &apos;m listening .
and ...
that &apos;s all i got .
i didn &apos;t say i was solving something .
i just said i didn &apos;t understand .
i want credit for it .
whatever you get , i want credit .
hmm . whatever .
mr. thiessen , you covered the bombing at the oak lawn synagogue ?
that &apos;s right .
and it &apos;s your opinion that this bomb was very similar to that one ?
identical .
in both cases , the device was fashioned from a metal canister ,
densely packed with hydrazine nitrate explosive
and a simple , remote @-@ triggered circuit .
but this utilized a different triggering mechanism
than the synagogue bombing ?
no , no .
it was identical .
a modified flashbulb ?
yes , from a camera . it &apos;s quite clever .
it produces just enough flame to trigger the fuse .
oh , that &apos;s interesting .
but when you reported on the synagogue bombing ,
you never mentioned that fact .
it &apos;s kind of a technical detail .
a little beyond the scope of a basic news article .
of course .
it &apos;s just that whoever planted the bomb at the vindicator
had to know the layout of the building ,
the dumbwaiters , mr. sanborn &apos;s schedule ,
and how to build a bomb exactly like the defenders of allah &apos;s .
objection , your honor !
objection ? there hasn &apos;t been a question yet .
overruled .
and if you never reported on the triggering mechanism ,
mr. thiessen , the only person i can think of
who possesses all of that knowledge would be you .
objection , your honor .
this is completely without basis .
yes , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re right .
i have to sustain that objection .
well , that &apos;s okay ,
your honor . i have nothing further .
mrs. florrick ,
thank you for visiting .
peter .
pastor .
pastor , this is zach and grace .
welcome .
mrs. florrick ,
would you ever like to talk sometime ,
just the two of us ?
no .
i have respected the way you &apos;ve stood by your husband .
it &apos;s a lesson in forbearance .
well , it &apos;s a lesson in something .
you told your boss .
about being poached ? sure .
and julius ?
i told you that in confidence .
stern found out i leaked .
he fired me .
i know . that &apos;s why the coffee .
why &apos;d you tell them ?
why didn &apos;t you just come over to stern &apos;s ?
you don &apos;t seem like the loyal type .
i know .
it &apos;s crazy , huh ?
what about lockhart / gardner ?
is there a job there ?
for who ?
me .
no .
what are you doing ?
the coffee was too hot to throw in your face .
i &apos;m talking about the very essence of our faith .
take care .
what does christian forbearance mean ?
when the apostle paul wrote in philippians , chapter four , verse five ,
&quot; let your forbearing spirit be evident to all , &quot;
what did he mean by that ?
did he mean that we should tell our neighbor ...
i &apos;ll be right back .
i &apos;ll put up with you until you improve ? no .
christian forbearance has no time limits ...
gerry .
okay , it &apos;s just us . what &apos;s up ?
he &apos;s got me in a corner . childs .
he &apos;s got stuff on me even you don &apos;t know about ,
and he &apos;ll use it .
unless you testify against me ?
peter , i have no choice .
you know childs is going to make you lie on the stand .
it &apos;s not all lies .
not the videotape of us .
you know the meeting in the hotel room .
do you believe in hell ?
do i believe in hell ?
sure . why ?
do you believe you have to answer for your sins ?
peter , we don &apos;t have time .
do you believe it ?
actually , i do , yes .
peter , i &apos;m sorry .
he threatened me .
childs threatened me . he threatened everything .
let &apos;s not even talk about the stuff i have on you ,
because you &apos;re beyond caring about that .
let &apos;s , let &apos;s talk about the stuff i have on your son anthony .
your married son .
that &apos;s right .
your beautiful legacy .
peter .
peter , don &apos;t .
don &apos;t . you &apos;re a christian .
you &apos;re damn right i am .
haven &apos;t you read the old testament ?
tonight &apos;s good . yeah .
no .
oh , i can make the reservation .
no , it &apos;s fine .
will , really , it &apos;s fine .
hey , i phoned you .
good . we &apos;ll have fun .
okay , i &apos;ll see you soon .
you &apos;re going out ?
yup .
where ?
i don &apos;t know .
preheat the oven for ten minutes .
ignore the box .
it says it cooks in 12 minutes , but it &apos;s really 15 .
oh , come on . am i not supposed to be jealous ?
i don &apos;t think i care what you are .
tell zach only one hour on the computer .
i ... i feel like you &apos;re punishing me for something i didn &apos;t do .
i &apos;m not punishing you , peter .
i &apos;m going out to dinner with an old friend .
what you saw at church was me protecting our family .
the guy was wearing a wire .
it &apos;s over .
what is ?
us . me caring .
me actually thinking that you &apos;re changing .
i am changing .
no , you &apos;re not .
you want to think you are
so you can go back to what you did before .
then help me .
help me .
if you &apos;re right , help me .
no .
you once said
that everything would be fine if we just kept talking .
we can ... we can argue ,
we can fight , but we have to keep talking .
so , there &apos;s nothing i can say ?
