criminal minds s05e12
joe what &apos;s your 20 ?
almost done with rounds .
just checking the carousel .
you need some backup ? i &apos;m falling asleep here .
no .
but could you leave a cupful of coffee in the pot ?
anyone back here ?
this is private property .
i &apos;m gonna give you 5 seconds to come on out .
funny don .
i &apos;m a man of simple pleasures
and that was one of them .
what are you doing back here ?
switching out a timing belt . what are you doing back here ?
thought i saw someone messing around .
nah it was just me .
it wasn &apos;t you .
turn it off .
what ?
turn it off !
what ?
ed ?
go ahead .
you need to send that backup .
i see checkmate in 5 . what do you see ?
i see it in 3 .
we &apos;ve missed you out here .
thank you .
thanks . i uh i had to take a little break .
how come ?
i used to play with a co @-@ worker friend of mine .
he &apos;s probably the best mind i ever went up against .
one day he just decided that he didn &apos;t want to play anymore .
so you gave up too ?
just the opposite . i attempted to play
through every permutation of moves on a chessboard .
that &apos;s an infinite number of games .
it &apos;s not infinite . it &apos;s just--
it &apos;s exponentially large .
you couldn &apos;t have played through them all .
there &apos;s an average of 40 moves per chess game
and i &apos;ll tell you something-- the more i played
the more i realized that every single match
every single chess game
is really just a simple variation on the exact same theme .
you know ? it &apos;s aggressive opening
patient mid @-@ game
inevitable checkmate
and i realized why my friend quit .
he was tired of repeating the exact same patterns
and expecting a different outcome .
so you have a lifetime
of chess strategy in your head
and you &apos;re just sitting on it .
i still use it .
i just uh ... i apply it differently .
i have to go .
it was good seeing you .
rita stuart 25
second victim in atlantic city .
pretty public spot for a dump site .
you know technically
i think it would qualify more as a disposal site .
you don &apos;t leave a body on a merry @-@ go @-@ round out of convenience .
he took some time with her appearance didn &apos;t he ?
yeah . her nails were polished
her hair was cut clothes were brand @-@ new .
wants her to look her best when found .
that &apos;s a lot of remorse .
who is victim number one ?
stacia jackson 29 .
she was found at a local playground .
quite a change in victimology .
what &apos;s the connection between these women ?
there is none . rita was married stacia was single .
rita worked at a diner
stacia was a corporate lawyer .
according to their credit cards
they never came within 10 miles of each other .
both women were taken 2 months ago ?
yeah . they lived such completely different lives
the police didn &apos;t tie their abduction together until now .
was there any evidence of sexual assault ?
there was no evidence of violence of any kind .
so how did they die ?
rita had a stroke
stacia had a brain hemorrhage .
look at this
the unsub gave them a battery of drugs--
atracurium doxacurium .
these are neural inhibitors .
they block signals from the brain to the muscles .
he put them in medical comas for 2 months .
actually they weren &apos;t in a coma .
you &apos;d need phenobarbital
to keep them unconscious
and they didn &apos;t have that .
so wait a minute . these victims were paralyzed
but they were still conscious ?
they could open their eyes hear
probably even feel stimulation .
physical immobility but mental awareness .
this unsub wants total domination over them .
and he turns their bodies
into prisons to do it .

&quot; anything you cannot relinquish
&quot; when it has outlived its usefulness
&quot; possesses you
&quot; and in this materialistic age
a great many of us
are possessed by our possessions . &quot;
keeping women in a conscious paralysis
reads as sadism .
definitely dehumanizing
reducing them to objects .
but there &apos;s nothing else about this profile
that takes us down that path .
these women were found in excellent condition .
there was no evidence of bed sores
they were well fed through an i.v.
his access to i.v.s and drugs--
he almost certainly has medical training .
are we sure this is a he ?
the care this unsub shows these victims
although they are dehumanized
the profile says female .
what about the postmortem posing ?
that &apos;s a lot of dead weight
for a woman to carry .
these women are petite . they &apos;re under 100 pounds .
all right if we reconsider the gender of the profile
what changes ?
nothing . if anything it fits better .
men kill to fulfill a sexual compulsion . women don &apos;t .
you see this in angel of mercy killers
like genene jones and amy archer .
they didn &apos;t care about race or hair color .
it &apos;s men that do .
damn straight . men do .
well hello red. look at you. guys .
garcia what did you find out about the clothing
the unsub &apos;s dressing the victims in ?
at first only that both garments were made from chiffon .
but with the wonder twin powers of the atlantic city police
and my impeccable eye for fashion
we have also determined that these garments fit rediculous well
they &apos;re super flattering to each victim &apos;s exact measurements
kind of exactly like the unsub whipped them up herself .
maybe that &apos;s what connects the victims .
how so ?
maybe she isn &apos;t just killing petite women
because they &apos;re easier to abduct and pose .
but because of a physical type .
she wants a body type .
sewing clothes for a specific size of woman .
please tell me she is not killing these women because she needs human models .
i mean there &apos;s gotta be more to it than that .
there probably is .
but at least we have a start on the victimology .
prentiss and morgan
i want you to interview the victims &apos; family .
talk to them about lifestyle choices .
any body image issues these women may have had .
reid go to rita stuart &apos;s autopsy
see if the drugs point to any specific medical training
the unsub might have had .
dave and i will go to the disposal site .
and garcia .
sir .
i want you to check missing persons reports for the last 2 months .
see if any abductions match what we know .
we need to find out if the unsub &apos;s already taken another victim .
agent jareau ?
detective marty cotrone .
hi . these are ssas
morgan and prentiss .
were you able to contact the families ?
they &apos;re already here .
did they bring the pictures we asked for ?
yeah . they were pretty confused by that .
and to be honest so am i.
agent morgan i don &apos;t understand .
how does what my daughter looked like
have to do with the monster who killed her ?
we think the unsub is looking for a physical type .
fit but petite .
this is her . ihis is my wife .
did rita work out stay in shape ?
sure . i guess .
she went to the gym at least 3 times a week .
stacia took pride in every aspect of her appearance .
in what way ?
you know her clothes .
it was her clothes. she loved to shop .
it looks like she has kind of a bohemian streak going on .
yeah .
what were her favorite places to shop ?
high @-@ end boutiques .
expensive ones ?
certainly .
and dressed to fit .
she was tiny .
everything had to be taken in
so she &apos;d look ...
her best .
would you mind writing down some of her favorite places to go ?
so these are mostly consignment and thrift shops ?
that &apos;s really all we could afford .
did she ever have these clothes altered ?
uh tailored to fit her better ?
i never really paid attention .
would she ever have worn something like that ?
would she ever wear anything like that ?
no .
dave !
can you hear that ?
yeah .
she &apos;s posing her victims in a place that represents innocence and childhood .
most serial killers don &apos;t have a
particularly happy childhood .
my guess is she wants them to have the fun
she never got to have .
let &apos;s think about how she &apos;s doing this practically .
how &apos;s she getting them from her car to the carousel ?
she &apos;s moving a body in the middle of the night .
she needs to make conditions as favorable as possible .
so she &apos;d need a vehicle that afforded her privacy--
a van or an suv .
that &apos;s still a lot of ground to cover once she parks .
even if these women are light
she risks getting caught carrying a corpse .
if she has a medical background
what if she use a wheelchair
something that would help her move them quickly ?
and if she has a wheelchair
that means her van has a lift
which would be helpful to unload a body .
which also means she has a handicap placard .
which would give her the closest place to park .
i &apos;ll have garcia pull all vehicles
with handicap registrations .
thanks dave .
once i have the knees bent
i can get leverage under her .
normally an assistant helps me .
but i can do it by myself if i need to .
i &apos;m assuming the unsub would have this training too .
let me ask you this-- is there anything specific about it ?
no any caregiver out there can do this--
docs nurses orderlies .
where do you think she &apos;s getting the drugs that she &apos;s using ?
do you think she could be manipulating a doctor or a pharmacist maybe ?
he &apos;d be criminally negligent if she was .
but it is possible . i mean doctors order things
through residents nurses forge signatures
prescriptions fall through cracks .
that &apos;s a lot of drugs and a lot of cracks .
she keeps these women paralyzed for 2 months .
your report said both of them
had hair extensions clipped in .
yes to hide the fact that clumps of their real hair had fallen out .
but if they were fed through i.v.s
that wasn &apos;t from malnutrition right ?
you see this a lot in bedridden patients .
loss of motor function . especially in a young woman like this .
of course .
psychic shock .
yeah the mental effects take a physical toll .
one last question ... in your professional opinion
do you think the hair extensions were clipped on before or after death ?
before .
and you seem pretty certain of that ?
you know the old wives &apos; tale about your hair and nails
growing after death .
what &apos;s really happening is that dehydration
is shrinking your skin pulling it back .
based on where she put these extensions
they were definitely still alive .
now we know this unsub is stuck in a rich fantasy right ?
an incredibly detailed delusion .
we don &apos;t know what the delusion is
but we know that it involves remaking these women
and it begins the moment she has them drugged .
so she has them paralyzed and she can do whatever she wants
why is she killing them ?
well i don &apos;t think she means to .
the brain is a machine designed to respond to stimuli .
if you keep the brain awake but the body immobile
it breaks down loses its hair .
after 2 months it eventually strokes out .
so death isn &apos;t this unsub &apos;s goal
it &apos;s an unfortunate side effect .
exactly . what &apos;d you find out ?
both rita stuart and stacia jackson were clothes hounds
but because they were petite women they had a lot of their stuff altered .
could be how our unsub is finding her victims .
she gets her hands on their measurements .
but we already exhausted tailors alteration shops .
there &apos;s no overlap .
the tailors might send specialty items out to third parties .
dig deep into extended employment records
and see who they might be subcontracting to .
garcia needs to talk to us .
go ahead garcia .
hello my pretties . i have finished my missing persons sweep .
i &apos;ve got nothing on the medical vehicle
but 2 new matches on the clothes make the woman front .
cindy admundson . she was abducted outside a thrift store
and maxine wynan was last seen at the hillridge mall .
that sounds like our girl .
any surveillance footage at the mall ?
no . it was an outside parking lot . so sorry .
the new abductees ... what &apos;s their physical type ?
they look pretty tiny to me .
i &apos;m gonna send you pictures . also if it pleases the court
i would like to direct your attention to exhibit &quot; a &quot;
the calendar map .
what about it ?
both of these new victims were abducted one week ago
exactly one day before the bodies of rita stuart
and stacia jackson respectively turned up .
she doesn &apos;t let a body go until she has a replacement .
thank you so much .
excuse me .
do you need some help ?
oh the ramp &apos;s broken .
you want me to call a tow truck ?
i just need to get the chair in the van
and then i can go home .
well we could load it .
you think ?
sure . we &apos;ll put it in the back ?
go on in .
you pull i &apos;ll lift .
ok .
here we go .
do we need to lock the wheels or anything like that ?
you &apos;re so pretty .
victim is mary newsome .
abducted 2 months ago .
she was found on this bench first thing this morning .
ok well it looks like her style .
it &apos;s chiffon and it &apos;s sewn to fit .
if she &apos;s disposed of this body it means she &apos;s recently taken a new victim .
we &apos;ll call hotch we &apos;ll comb through missing persons reports
from the last 48 hours .
i &apos;ll pulling them .
thank you . mm @-@ hmm .
what ?
these aren &apos;t hair extensions .
maybe her hair was too brittle .
maybe . i don &apos;t know .
you know what ? this is a wig .
kanekalon i think .
what &apos;s that ?
uh synthetic hair . there &apos;s nothing special about it .
it &apos;s used in wigs all over the world .
but look at this .
ooh . are those stitches ?
on her scalp .
she sewed this in .
yeah . wallace . i got it . thank you .
hey i think we found who was taken last night .
her name is bethany wallace .
her husband says she never came home from the dry cleaners
where she stopped off to pick up some clothes .
anybody at the cleaners see anything ?
the employees were busy locking up . but they did mention
that they do farm out work to tailors who work from home .
good . we can match records based on who worked on bethany &apos;s clothes .
we just got the pictures of the 2 recent abductions from garcia .
line up the photos of the new victims
next to the bodies they replaced . that might help us with the timeline .
you guys see this ?
yeah . she &apos;s matching up the victims physically one to one .
she &apos;s a collector .
we &apos;re ready to give the profile .
the unsub we &apos;re looking for is a woman .
she &apos;s a collector .
it &apos;s a psychopathology similar to hoarding .
so when we say collector
we &apos;re not talking about stamps or baseball cards .
it &apos;s not what your kids or even you
might pursue as a normal hobby .
this is an attachment to objects that &apos;s become obsessive
by someone who is antisocial and extremely introverted .
these people attach a part of themselves
to their collection .
if you try to separate them from it
or take it away from them
they will react violently even psychotically .
they &apos;ve suffered damage to their prefrontal cortex .
that &apos;s the part of the brain that regulates
basic freudian fantasy / reality .
they can still function like drive a car
go to work even do their taxes .
in fact she excels at goal @-@ oriented jobs
like the precision of sewing .
or the details of abduction .
but they &apos;ve lost their ability to categorize the difference
between living and dead uh belonging and loss .
that has been irreparably destroyed .
so what &apos;s she collecting women ?
actually
we think she &apos;s collecting dolls .
technically replacing them .
we believe that she lost the originals
sometime within the last 3 months
and this is what served as her stressor .
she searched for a replacement
and when she couldn &apos;t find them
she started abducting the closest possible surrogate .
women of different ethnicities
but of similar physicality .
the drug @-@ induced paralysis is part of the fantasy .
she puts her victims in a position where they can &apos;t talk back
so she can fetishize them like the objects she &apos;s lost .
i respect your analysis
but this woman kidnapped 6 women
and killed 3 of them .
and you &apos;re telling us this is about dolls ?
this unsub stitched a wig
onto the scalp of her latest victim .
it &apos;s a technique used to attach hair to porcelain dolls .
and keep in mind collectors and serial killers
do share certain traits . uh ...
a lot of serial killers take trophies
attaching the same significance to them
that this collector does to objects .
but this unsub &apos;s intent isn &apos;t violence .
she needs this collection to be complete
so she can feel in control of her life
probably to overcome some trauma she experienced .
she really only feels that control
when the collection is complete
which is why she &apos;s repeating an abduction pattern with living victims .
if she loses a doll or in this case
if she loses a woman who represents a doll
she has to replace it .
this woman works alone .
we know she has medical training .
look for nurse &apos;s aides or orderlies
who were fired for a lack of social graces .
she can &apos;t fake a bedside manner .
we believe she &apos;s currently working
as a tailor or a seamstress
and we &apos;re following those leads now .
but do let us know
if you notice any overlap in your suspect pools .
thank you .
of course i remember ms . jackson .
we were all sad to hear what happened .
do you ever farm out tailoring jobs
someone who might have done this ?
no .
to be perfectly honest
we wouldn &apos;t even sell something so dated .
let me take a look .
where did you get this ?
why ? did you see something ?
look at this lockstitch .
it &apos;s a handkerchief pattern .
you see this on silk @-@ sewn handkerchiefs .
and it &apos;s all done by hand .
so this is her signature ? this is unique to her .
i couldn &apos;t do it not even with a machine .
if there someplace that specializes
in handcrafted sewing like this ?
no .
i &apos;ll tell you this much though .
she &apos;s been at it a long time .
this woman ...
is an artist .
hotch this is bethany wallace &apos;s husband karl .
we brought him in for questioning .
do you know where my wife is ?
we &apos;re searching for her sir .
no . you have to find her in the next 24 hours .
bethany is a diabetic .
look agent prentiss said
that the woman who took her
has medical training .
so ... bethany could have a chance ?
what ?
she keeps her victims in a drug @-@ induced state .
they can &apos;t communicate .
these ... these drugs will they--
we don &apos;t know .
but we &apos;re doing everything we can .
everyone
this is sally .
be nice to her .
so doctor if a diabetics were given
this battery of drugs to keep her paralyzed
what would the reaction be ?
diabetics metabolize everything they consume differently .
food drinks drugs .
it all gets broken down to blood sugar
at varying rates .
most likely this patient seized up
minutes after she was medicated .
so she &apos;s already dead .
probably .
although ...
there is another possibility .
bethany &apos;s condition could break down the drugs
faster than the other victims .
she could regain control of her body ?
every hour that she doesn &apos;t turn up is a reason for hope .
we &apos;re still running out of time .
if the drugs don &apos;t kill bethany
she &apos;s not gonna last long without insulin .
look collectors are good honest people .
just because you enjoy dolls doesn &apos;t make you a freak or a pedophile .
we appreciate that sir
but the woman that we &apos;re looking for
has lost her ability to control her obsession .
she &apos;s killed 3 women trying to recreate a type of doll
she had as a child .
describe the line to me .
well there &apos;s a pattern to the victims .
they &apos;re in their 20s and they &apos;re petite .
most doll lines revolve around infants .
is she dressing them like babies ?
no she &apos;s not .
their wardrobe consists of chiffon dresses
worn by one blond woman a redhead and a black woman .
the dresses--is she sewing them herself ?
how did you know that ?
it &apos;s the valois line .
local company back in the late eighties .
probably when our unsub was prepubescent .
yeah .
they promoted feminism and multiculturalism .
strong independent girls from different backgrounds
who could still be friends .
reid . birth certificate to fill out .
a form to describe their lives .
and a kit to sew your own clothes .
jj said she &apos;s been at it for a while .
she &apos;s probably been sewing since she was a little kid .
wait a minute . sir what &apos;s this contest that they held ?
that was to see who could come up with the most imaginative doll .
sew a dress . write an essay to describe her .
if you won the contest you &apos;d have your doll featured in next year &apos;s line .
i assume that didn &apos;t end well did it ?
no it did not .
it &apos;s a classic tool child psychologists use .
tell me a story with these dolls .
when the company got essays with thinly @-@ veiled references
to physical or sexual abuse
they turned the entry forms and the dolls over to the police .
the publicity killed the line .
you said the company was local right ?
they might still have the clothes in evidence .
how are the essays going ?
makes for some pretty depressing reading .
prentiss is having a good time .
these dolls are all like little time capsules
only the eighties fashion wasn &apos;t so kind to them .
i &apos;m surprised how many little girls
knew how to make shoulder pads .
how &apos;s it going on your end ?
i got a list of vendors the victims went to--
tailors seamstresses that sort of thing .
hey jj you said something about a handkerchief hem right ?
that &apos;s exactly like what she sews for her victims .
what &apos;s the name on the entry ?
samantha malcolm .
she &apos;s on my list .
wait a minute guys . i have her essay around here somewhere .
right here .
&quot; sally doesn &apos;t like the room with the lightning . &quot;
that can &apos;t be good .
ok guys i just got samantha malcolm &apos;s
medical records and ...
oh my god she was doomed .
like emily bronte doomed
like shakespeare doomed
like red @-@ shirted ensign in &quot; star trek &quot; doomed .
garcia what happened to her ?
oh uh sorry uh
well for the first 10 years nothing
and then she started a battery of electroshock treatments .
at 10 ? who subjects a child to ect ?
that would be her father dr. arthur malcolm .
he runs an inpatient mental health facility
for troubled young people called new lives .
at first the essay that samantha wrote raised some flags
but her father explained that the therapy
was to deal with the recent death of her mother .
after that he started her
on a serious regimen of anti @-@ psychotic drugs
which he weaned her off of a few years ago .
it explains her familiarity with medication .
where is she now ?
uh her father declared her incompetent
so he &apos;s still the legal guardian .
everything is in his name .
and all of her records list new lives as her residence .
she couldn &apos;t keep victims in an inpatient facility .
she needs privacy .
garcia what about real estate holdings
in her father &apos;s name ?
just his own . but new lives has
a bunch of outpatient and halfway houses all over town .
jj where does she work ?
i have her placed at 3 different shops around town .
all right let &apos;s split up and cover the shops and the facility .
i want to go to new lives .
whether or not she &apos;s there i want to talk to the father .
there are literally hundreds of therapies to help kids through loss .
electroshock is not one of them .
take rossi .
be nice to each other .
see you later .
we &apos;re leaving .
no ... no .
i am very confused gentlemen .
what does this have to do with samantha ?
we need to talk to her . is she here ?
no she &apos;s at work .
does she live here
or did you move her into one of your halfway houses ?
as a matter of fact she is in one of my houses .
well we &apos;ll need the address .
and i &apos;ll need to know what this is about .
she might be tied to a series of abductions .
that &apos;s not possible . it &apos;s not my daughter .
is samantha on her own at this house ?
there are no other patients right ?
she thought that was best and i agreed .
yeah but let &apos;s face it--
you &apos;re happy that she &apos;s out of your hair .
i beg your pardon ?
because if you had been visiting her recently doctor
you would know what she &apos;s been doing .
samantha has always been troubled .
3 women are dead because of her .
she &apos;s not capable of that .
are you certain ?
i mean the effects of electroshock
especially at that age are permanent .
but maybe you knew that .
my wife died when samantha was 10
and she never recovered .
i tried everything .
child psychiatry pet therapy
nothing helped .
she was cutting herself .
she was in pain .
that &apos;s the end of this meeting .
where &apos;s your daughter doctor ?
and agent rossi if you try to talk to her
a mentally ill woman
without her knowing what she &apos;s doing--
do you know about the women she &apos;s keeping ?
and have no medical or legal counsel present
you &apos;ll have no case . do you understand me ? none .
we &apos;ll keep the police here
in case samantha drops in for a visit .
let &apos;s go reid .
hey a really fast question .
why are these toys here ?
i use them in my therapy .
no i understand that
but why are they way up on this shelf
away from where any kids can actually reach them ?
they &apos;re reminders of patients that i &apos;ve helped .
let me ask you something .
what was the name of the girl you helped with this one ?
jenny larson .
hmm . and this one ?
what was the name of the girl you helped with this one ?
abigail moore .
how about this one ?
linda krauss .
these girls are what
they &apos;re like 9.12 years old i &apos;m assuming ?
my ph.d. is on the effect of trauma
on prepubescent girls .
i do not appreciate what you &apos;re implying .
oh i &apos;m not implying anything .
i &apos;m making an inference .
an inference is an educated guess .
and based on that i form a hypothesis .
for instance my hypothesis here
is that after you raped your daughter
you submitted her to electroshock treatment
to make sure she stayed quiet .
this is outrageous .
and then out of guilt you bought her toys
more specifically you bought her a line of dolls .
because that &apos;s what serial molesters do .
they give gifts .
so you continued the pattern
with your other patients
and once they left your care
you added their toys to your collection .
i &apos;m sorry you can &apos;t back up your story doctor .
this is why i love my job doctor .
because my lab it &apos;s a jury of your peers .
my tests will be jenny larson abigail moore
and linda krauss .
the d.a. will put them on the stand
and i &apos;m going to personally bring these dolls in
and we &apos;re going to watch how they react .
or you could tell us where your daughter is
and we &apos;ll tell the d.a. you cooperated .
but once we walk out this door
that deal comes off the table .
2529 adams street .
you &apos;ll tell them right ? that i cooperated .
you want to know how i figured you out ?
those toys .
you take care of them .
these ones you treasured .
but you know what ? the collection &apos;s not complete .
where are they ?
she &apos;s coming back .
i have to put it back in .
no please .
please don &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t leave me .
let us go .
i can &apos;t .
samantha ?
hi .
uh my name &apos;s spencer .
i &apos;m with the fbi .
i know what your father did to you
and i want you to know
that he can never ever hurt you again .
he never touched me . he &apos;s a good father .
he loves me .
i know that he probably forced you to say those things
and he punished you if you got it wrong
sent you to the room with the lightning .
yeah .
the dolls that your father gave you after he hurt you
what would happen to them ?
he kept them in his office with the other toys .
that &apos;s where he let you play with them ?
but when i moved out i had to take my friends with me .
i couldn &apos;t leave them behind .
of course . and so you went you get them .
what--what did you find ?
he gave them to another girl didn &apos;t he ?
do you want them back ?
he said i couldn &apos;t .
he said they were gone for good .
he lied . he &apos;s been lying to you for a long time .
do you want to see them ?
can i ?
yeah . yeah do you want to play with them ?
clear . we need medical here .
hold on . hold on one second .
hey samantha ?
listen . you need to go with these men
but your friends can go with you ok ?
they won &apos;t take-- they won &apos;t take them away ?
i promise
no one will ever take them away again .
well done agent reid .
thanks .
checkmate in 12 .
