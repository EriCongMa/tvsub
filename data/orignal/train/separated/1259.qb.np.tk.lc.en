good scottish lad from an old boston family ,
politics in his blood .
holy crap , ma .
i can &apos;t even see the table .
glitter , ma ?
it &apos;s festive .
it &apos;s hard to clean up .

&quot; maximum depth -- 180 feet &quot; ?

maura .
at least he &apos;s certified .
i haven &apos;t had time to take the course .
so you &apos;ll do that
before or after your &quot; outback lady walk &quot; ?
are you also in the remake of &quot; out of africa &quot; ?
give me that .
special delivery .
oh , yeah , just walk right in .
okay , thanks .
wow , you look hot .
nice hat . you look hot , too , jane .
you two ever decide to bat for the other team --
not on your team .
what is that ? is that a surfboard ?
what is he doing here ?
he &apos;s helping me .
helping you what ? your car &apos;s outside .
sweet , huh ?
&quot; you want this dud . &quot;
&quot; this dude , &quot; jane . d @-@ u @-@ d .
yo , mrs. rizz , you look hot .
stop it , giovanni , or i &apos;ll tell your mother .
no , don &apos;t tell my mom .
that &apos;s what all this is about ,
you buying all this stuff --
it &apos;s about hope , isn &apos;t it ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
oh , yes , you do .
whenever you get in a crisis ,
you get on a first @-@ name basis with the u.p.s. man .
maura , it &apos;s time to find her .
no . only 65 % of adopted children
seek out their biological parents .
i &apos;m in the other 35 % .
35 % having an identity crisis .
rizzoli .
yeah .
okay . we &apos;ll be right there .
come on . we got a case .
hey , you can take your vest ,
&apos;cause the murder is near franklin park .
you got a murder in the franklin park zoo ?
why ? you got family there ?
jane !
you &apos;re so funny .
she &apos;s so funny .
and hot .
what &apos;s there to talk about ?
my birth mother was an unwed college student
who was sneaking around with a southie gangster .
so ?
that &apos;s at least interesting .
my birth mother married the neighborhood plumber .
the only sneaking around she did was in filene &apos;s basement .
paddy doyle , my father --
in sperm only .
yeah , who is waiting to be tried for 15 murders ,
told hope that i died at birth .
help me understand how that could make for a successful reunion .
don &apos;t you want to know anything about her ?
no !
you ...
you found her , didn &apos;t you ?
you did .
you &apos;re gonna get the worst case of hives in your life
if you lie .
i had her first name , her age ,
where she went to college , my birth date --
i couldn &apos;t help it .
okay , so now what ?
i don &apos;t know what , okay ?
good morning . what do we have ?
white woman , beaten .
looks like somebody took a blow torch to her hands .
what , trying to conceal her i.d. ?
don &apos;t think so .
found her driver &apos;s license in her back pocket .
i think dr . isles is going in .
she loves dumpster diving .
celia jaffe , 27 .
early @-@ bird dumpster diver found her .
so glad i brought my tyvek suit .
oh , shoot . i forgot mine .
darn . me too .
lividity indicates she died sometime after midnight
and was dumped here shortly thereafter .
it &apos;s a good thing we got an i.d.
we &apos;re not getting any prints off of these .
i &apos;ll find out if she has a husband or a boyfriend .
let &apos;s get her photographed , get her out of here .
what are you doing ?
checking the weather .
what ? i said , &quot; checking the weather . &quot;
okay , okay . sheesh .
why aren &apos;t you examining the body ?
i knew it .
the weather ? really ?
it &apos;s a daily weather forecast ...
on her wikipedia page .
whose page ?
oh , my g--
maura , she looks just like you !
you mean i look like her .
her name is hope -- dr. hope martin .
wow . she &apos;s kind of famous .
&quot; dr. martin founded
an international relief agency : m.e.n.d. &quot;
medical emergency network for doctors .
their mission is to treat women and children
who are suffering .
keep scrolling .
see the forensic pathology residency she did in sarajevo ?
yeah .
she &apos;s done everything .
so she identifies victims of genocide
and saves women and children around the world -- big deal .
you are just as accomplished , maura .
no , i &apos;m not .
paddy said she was brilliant .
and recently divorced .
she has a daughter -- cailin , 18 .
she &apos;s been living abroad for the past 20 years .
okay , celia jaffe needs an autopsy .
and i need a cause of death , maura .
hope even developed a technique
to identify the victims of genocide
we &apos;re still using today .
well , it &apos;s too bad she &apos;s not local .
we could use her right about now .
she &apos;s probably very curious about you , too .
why would she be curious ?
she doesn &apos;t even know i exist .
or maybe she does .
how can she not ?
she hasn &apos;t made any effort to contact me .
okay , maura , maybe she saw that
and thinks paddy was cheating on her
and had a kid named maura .
or maybe she only reads fancy french newspapers .
or maybe she hasn &apos;t thought of paddy doyle
in the past 36 years .
or me .
wait a minute .
no , don &apos;t .
oh my g-- she &apos;s moved back to boston ?
come on . maura , i don &apos;t believe in coincidences .
this is meant to be .
i &apos;d be turning her world upside down for what ?
so she can have you in her life , okay ?
late is a million times better than never .
not if it causes her pain .
look at the pain you &apos;re in .
i got a suspect upstairs .
come on . do the autopsy , okay ?
it &apos;ll make you feel better .
come on . come on . come on . march .
he won &apos;t come upstairs .
says we can talk to him right here .
all right , let me try .
he &apos;s all yours .
mr. jaffe , thank you for coming .
look , if this is about that parking ticket ,
what a waste of my tax dollars .
it &apos;s about your wife .
what about celia ?
we believe she was murdered .
where were you last night ?
where the hell do you think i was ?
celia ! get over here !
faster !
shut up . you &apos;re gonna wake up the baby .
oh , now you decide to sleep .
you see that ? that &apos;s my wife .
a woman was using your i.d. ,
and we found her body .
oh , my god .
oh , my wallet was stolen last week .
your wallet was stolen ?
shh ! you will wake the baby .
any idea where ?
no . i don &apos;t know .
it could &apos;ve been at the mall
or when i was going to get coffee .
going to the mall and getting lattes
while i &apos;m bustin &apos; my ass to support you ?
shh ! you &apos;ll wake the baby .
but you didn &apos;t report it ?
you &apos;re driving around with no license ?
with our insurance rates ?
shut up , or i will arrest you for baby wake @-@ age .
i haven &apos;t had time to go get a new one .
besides , whoever stole it --
they sent it back to me in the mail .
see ?
and -- and everything was in it ,
except for my driver &apos;s license .
that &apos;s a good move , celia .
yeah ? nice work , rick .
come here . it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
oh , my god . i am never having kids .
so , uh , sounds like our victim
was pretending to be somebody else .
and hiding from someone who apparently found her .
so , our victim steals a wallet ,
returns everything but the i.d. ,
assumes a new name ,
and ends up dead in a dumpster .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
what &apos;s the matter ?
that &apos;s sister winifred callahan .
one there .
she &apos;s the meanest person i &apos;ve ever met in my entire life .
i see you hiding out there ,
jane clementine rizzoli .
your middle name is clementine ?
hello , sister winifred .
i never would &apos;ve thought
the girl who broke a cafeteria window with her foot
would be on this side of the law .
i was 7 .
i was trying to kill a fly .
remind me what i gave you for comportment ?
um , c @-@ minus .
what &apos;s comportment ?
behavior .
so , um ... what brings you here ?
&quot; um &quot; ? i have counted two ums in 10 seconds ,
miss rizzoli .
it &apos;s ...
detective rizzoli .
i guess you don &apos;t read the newsletter .
big surprise .
i am here to do the lord &apos;s work .
wow . awarded a federal grant
to counsel families of homicide victims .
no kidding . here ?
i really would &apos;ve preferred cambridge ,
but sister helen marie got that grant .
well , i can &apos;t wait to catch up ,
but i have to go to the morgue .
i &apos;ll be holding my breath for your return .
okay .
they had to bring in sister bitcher .
&quot; the lord &apos;s work . &quot;
yeah , that &apos;s what she said
when she hit me with a ruler because
i misspelled &quot; flamboyant . &quot;
why was the word &quot; flamboyant &quot;
on a second @-@ grade spelling test at a catholic school ?
i don &apos;t know .
and no one &apos;s reported her missing . why not ?
well , she has a depressed skull fracture .
must &apos;ve been a hefty weapon .
not a weapon .
so she just woke up this morning , and after she brushed her teeth ,
she thought , &quot; gee , my head hurts . &quot;
no . she has contrecoup contusion from a massive fall .
&quot; contrecoup &quot; means --
yeah , it &apos;s not my first rodeo .
it means her head bounced around inside her skull .
after striking a hard object .
so not a pillow .
it takes longer when you make jokes .
i would poke out my eyes out with a scalpel
if i didn &apos;t make jokes .
sister winnie is scary .
oh , don &apos;t call her &quot; winnie . &quot;
i got two weeks in detention for that .
could also be because
i was singing , &quot; winnie the poop . &quot;
oh ! oh , i might have something .
her fourth digit isn &apos;t
as badly burned as the others .
might be able to try a rehydration technique .
you can get a print off of that ?
it looks like a charred tootsie roll .
i &apos;ve never done it .
i &apos;ve only read about it in ...
an article published by a dr. hope martin .
well , perhaps we should call dr. hope martin .
no !
i -- i &apos;ll just try myself .
well , doc , you &apos;re not gonna --
you are .
you have to detach the finger
in order to rehydrate the tissue .
frost ?
tying my shoe .
your shoes don &apos;t have laces .
oh , my gosh .
detective frost ?
i think he passed out .
a student gave me this .
i think nuns are awesome .
it &apos;s words like &quot; awesome &quot;
that have ruined a glorious language .
your coffee is bitter .
i &apos;m sorry . shall i make a fresh pot ?
don &apos;t bother .
it would probably be bitter , too .
would you like some cream and sugar ?
nope . hate to get used to anything
in case there &apos;s a shortage .
what am i gonna do with my files ?
i need a great , big cabinet .
these police files ?
the families of the victims you &apos;ll be counseling ?
these are my internal files for the hell @-@ raisers .
jane was a hell @-@ raiser ?
jane rizzoli didn &apos;t like to be told what to do .
well , that &apos;s still true .
you think that &apos;s funny ?
so , that &apos;s all we know so far ?
hello , francesco .
uh , hi , sister .
fran-- your real name is francesco ?
yeah . you got a problem with that ?
i prefer to call people by their given names .
their parents went to a lot of trouble .
what is your full name , young man ?
speak up .
it &apos;s barold .
barold !
&quot; barold &quot; means &quot; spear . &quot;
it &apos;s a very substantial name .
wear it proudly , barold .
uh , listen , sister , we &apos;ve got a young woman ,
a jane doe down in the morgue .
we really have to get back to work .
am i keeping you ?
okay .
shouldn &apos;t a crime @-@ lab tech be doing this ?
no . stop criticizing .
i tried potassium chloride ,
but it was too destructive to the friction ridge skin .
you only got one finger .
what is that supposed to mean ?
it means you can &apos;t screw it up .
so maybe you call hope to do this .
i also only have only one biological mother ,
and i &apos;d rather not screw that up .
damn !
the ruffer rehydration method
modified by walker isn &apos;t working .
you don &apos;t know how to do it .
yes , i do .
no , you don &apos;t .
look , you said you wanted to know her , okay ?
meet her on a level playing field .
meet her as a colleague .
maura , i got to find out who this woman is .
who are you calling ?
dr. pike . he &apos;ll help .
no . no .
don &apos;t you dare call that knucklehead .
maura , just face whatever it is that &apos;s terrifying you .
face her .
this is the easiest way .
okay .
okay ?
okay .
okay . i &apos;m going to do it .
i am going to call her now .
like now now ?
yes . before i lose my nerve .
okay , don &apos;t you want to ...
no , no . no . i am perfectly calm .
i &apos;m dr. maura isles ,
the chief medical examiner of the commonwealth --
dr. martin .
hello ? is someone there ?
hello ?
no . you have to do it .
is someone there ? hello ?
hi .
i am calling from the office of dr. maura isles ,
the chief medical examiner
for the commonwealth of massachusetts .
could you hold for her , please ?
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t .
hello ?
please .
i &apos;m sorry .
i hate cellphones , don &apos;t you ?
um , so , we -- we are working on
a very difficult homicide together .
we &apos;re trying to identify a jane doe .
would you be willing to do a consult ?
yes , half an hour would be fine .
thank you so much .
a half an hour ?
are you out of your mind ?
you can do it .
yes , you can .
no .
you can do this .
is it too late to call in sick ?
i don &apos;t think i can do this .
i can &apos;t .
what ? no . oh , my g--
ma , cavanaugh is gonna kill you .
bpd hates tom macgregor .
he &apos;s soft on crime .
well , he &apos;s hard on school @-@ lunch reform .
put some pepper , pepper , pepper
on your poli , poli , politics .
never do that again .
you &apos;re funny and hot .
hey , you ever decide you want to ...
you &apos;re first on the list .
honey , don &apos;t you want to at least meet her ?
well , obviously , i &apos;m curious .
but i don &apos;t need a mother .
i have a mother .
what can i get you ?
have a coffee .
do you have any more of those green @-@ label organic beans ?
of course .
make it extra hot
and 1 % milk , not 2 % .
and flat with just a hint of foam .
and a spoon , please .
no coffee stirrer ?
there &apos;s an aftertaste .
most coffee stir sticks are made from 100 % birch wood .
there &apos;s no chemicals or toxins or glazes .
but the birch plant is known to be bitter ,
thus the slightly unpleasant aftertaste .
you must be dr. martin .
hi . i &apos;m detective jane rizzoli .
and i &apos;m angela . i &apos;m jane &apos;s mom .
and this is dr. maura isles .
what a pleasure .
i am flattered that you would want a consult .
i &apos;ve tried so many formulas --
tetrodotoxin glucose , methylene --
dr. isles , are you all right ?
why -- because i &apos;m talking too much
and talking too fast and not making any sense ?
you &apos;re showing signs of urticaria .
oh , you have hives .
oh , no ! oh , my gosh .
maura .
that must be because you ate , um , the brazil nuts .
yes .
dr. isles , how many times do we have to tell you
to avoid brazil nuts ?
could i get you a latte
made out out of the green @-@ label beans ?
no , thank you .
i would very much like to see your victim .
and i have a lot of work to do upstairs , so i &apos;m gonna go .
maura .
do you have your epipen ?
and i came up with this rehydration technique
because we were so desperate to identify the bodies .
after the genocide in sarajevo .
yes .
and then we had to use it again
to identify entire kurdish families
that were slaughtered by saddam hussein .
so , what made you go from your medical internship
to sarajevo ?
maybe i was punishing myself .
maybe i didn &apos;t believe that i could save people ,
but i knew that i could speak for the dead .
well , i wish i could speak for her .
she &apos;s someone &apos;s daughter .
that &apos;s what drives me .
everyone is someone &apos;s child .
you said you were punishing yourself .
for what ?
something stupid that i did when i was 18 .
i hope my daughter has better judgment
than i did then .
what did you do ?
i got pregnant .
and the baby died at birth .
it was terrible and traumatic .
but maybe there was a reason that she didn &apos;t survive .
see , her father was ...
evil .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t -- i didn &apos;t mean to pry .
i never talk about this .
i spent so many years trying to forget .
maybe it &apos;s because you &apos;re a doctor .
i feel a strange kinship with you .
me too .
for you .
for helping me change the future .
giovanni , you shouldn &apos;t have .
what were you thinking ? !
that you &apos;re hot .
and may @-@ december romances are all the rage , mrs. rizz .
i mean , you are such a cougar . meow !
you come one step closer ,
and i &apos;ll be bringing your mother
your body parts in a pie tin !
i &apos;m sorry , mrs. rizz .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just kind of lonely .
i mean ...
i mean , i think i &apos;m a catch .
why can &apos;t i find a girl
who understands all i got to offer ?
do you come on this strong to other girls ?
well , stronger , usually .
i mean , i was going easy on you
&apos;cause you &apos;re , you know , old .
can i just get a mom hug ?
come on .
just one mom hug .
come on , mrs. rizz . come here .
i friggin &apos; love you , mrs. rizz .
okay . yeah .
please tell me you &apos;re seeing whorls and ridges .
we are .
and there is excellent ridge detail .
okay , let me see if it scans .
that &apos;s a good print .
well done , doctors .
oh , my .
she gets very emotional
when we break a case wide open .
yes , i do .
how lovely .
thank you .
well , i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m sorry ,
but i have to go pick up my daughter .
thank you so much , dr. martin .
you are very welcome .
dr. isles ,
i would very much like to have lunch sometime .
of course .
you have my information .
let &apos;s make this sooner rather than later .
i really -- really enjoyed it .
maura ...
that was so beautiful !
when are you gonna tell her ?
never .
never , ever . never , ever . never , ever .
all right , gentlemen , turn left .
last desk on the right .
come on , francesco . move it along .
what the hell is she doing ?
making herself at home here in hell .
got it .
emma spencer , 27 .
holy crap .
she &apos;s a legal intern .
she works at the district attorney &apos;s office .
her prints are there
because she registered to take this year &apos;s bar exam .
got her dmv photo .
she looks just like celia jaffe .
what the hell is she doing stealing a new mother &apos;s wallet ?
how did somebody like that end up in a dumpster
and nobody reports her missing ?
maybe one of the creeps the d.a. &apos; s office prosecuted ?
she &apos;d only been there three months .
i &apos;m quitting . i can &apos;t take it .
i almost ran away in second grade
when i got stuck with that -- that --
sweet , kind , loving nun .
i am so out of here .
aw . you gonna grab your thomas the train backpack
and run away , francesco ?
can i take him ?
take me where , barold ?
to the d.a. &apos; s office .
we &apos;re gonna talk to our victim &apos;s boss .
oh , anything to stop moving her furniture .
hey , frankie , remember frost is the detective .
barold ?
emma &apos;s goal was to be assigned to the sexual @-@ assault team .
damn . this is just plain tragic .
sexual assault --
that &apos;s a tough job .
yeah , but she was cut out for it .
she was very smart and tough .
when was the last time that you saw her ?
last week .
she asked for a week off .
to study for the bar ?
no , actually , she said she had a family emergency .
this her boyfriend ?
that &apos;s her brother .
i just assumed that something happened to him .
they &apos;re very close .
they shared an apartment .
she didn &apos;t have any other family or a boyfriend ,
as far as i know .
was she being stalked ?
maybe somebody threatening her ?
no , i can &apos;t imagine that .
i think she would have told me .
she was always professional and upbeat--
until the day that she asked for some time off .
she seemed so down .
i just wish i knew why .
oh , excuse me .
i &apos;m gonna have to take this .
i have a trial going on .
devere .
so , you , want to go hang with sister winifred
and say the rosary , francesco ,
or come with me to interview the brother ?
you ever ask your mom why she named you &quot; barold , &quot; barold ?
okay , let &apos;s just stop .
she said she was studying for the bar .
she took off last week .
do you know where she went ?
no .
she just said she needed to hunker down and study .
she took her computer and one bag .
we &apos;d like to look through your apartment .
yeah , you can ... you can look through anything .
when was the last time you heard from your sister ?
every day .
she ... she sent me an e @-@ mail .
said she was tired , but ... but ... but good .
you can ... you can look through my account , too .
she was my only family .
i &apos;m really sorry for your loss .
sit up straight .
didn &apos;t find emma &apos;s computer ...
or anything else ... in her apartment .
that &apos;s too bad .
i &apos;m gonna go through the server at the d.a. &apos; s office
and track emma &apos;s correspondence .
would you like a cough drop , sister ?
it sounds like you have some phlegm in your throat .
i was thinking you might want to thank the lord
for that sandwich .
thank you
for my peanut @-@ butter @-@ and @-@ fluff sandwich .
although i wish it had more peanut butter and less fluff .
emma was sending e @-@ mail from the building where she worked ,
but she wasn &apos;t sending it from her office .
where was she sending it from ?
the i.p. address is from an unassigned office
in the courthouse basement .
what did we stumble on ?
looks like the lair of a serial killer .
frost , emma was investigating a cold case ...
a 17 @-@ year @-@ old who disappeared 10 years ago .
her remains were found last week .
&quot; the body of isabelle dubois , 17,
was discovered when a family was cleaning out a vacant home . &quot;
listen to this from 10 years ago .
&quot; emma spencer , also 17,
told police isabelle , her best friend ,
failed to show up for a planned sleep over . &quot;
best friends ... emma and isabelle .
man , they did everything together .
emma must have used her new job at the d.a. &apos; s office
to get this copy of isabelle &apos;s autopsy report .
she &apos;s even got the photos .
yuck .
this is a note from isabelle to emma .
it was written the day she disappeared .
&quot; he says he &apos;ll be my &apos; knight in shining armor.&apos;
gag me with a spoon .
but i &apos;m going tonight . i &apos;ll be fine .
love , izzie . &quot;
she wasn &apos;t fine .
it &apos;s the oldest teenage @-@ girl trick in the book .
emma covers for isabelle ,
says they &apos;re having a sleep over .
cost isabelle her life .
i think this is a lair of guilt .
you know , i &apos;m gonna have maura look at isabelle &apos;s remains .
that body is 10 years old .
maybe emma found something
the worcester m.e. &apos; s office missed .
she was asphyxiated
and has quite a bit of adipocere tissue .
i hate soap mummies .
okay , it says here
there &apos;s an abnormality to isabelle &apos;s left cheekbone .
it &apos;s an injury , not an abnormality .
that &apos;s why pike is still in worcester .
you see the tool marks on her zygomatic bone ?
on her cheekbone ?
yeah , those three round indentations
with scalloped edges . what is that from ?
it &apos;s a very strange pattern .
isabelle was struck with something hard enough
to break the skin and pierce the bone .
well , korsak &apos;s looking at
what &apos;s left of isabelle &apos;s clothing .
you said the body was found in an old lady &apos;s basement .
did the old lady kill her ?
it &apos;s doubtful .
doubtful ?
so she might have ?
no .
then why did you say &quot; doubtful &quot; ?
i just wanted you to know what uncertainty felt like .
oh , my g ...
maura , i didn &apos;t mean it ...
oh . i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
everything makes me cry .
adipocere tissue never makes me cry .
my mother said it was better that i didn &apos;t live .
okay , now you &apos;re being ridiculous .
she did not say that .
she said it was traumatic , right ?
which means that it makes her sad .
she doesn &apos;t want to dwell on it .
i just don &apos;t ever want her to know
that i &apos;m that evil child .
here . blow .
everything okay ?
allergies . she ate brazil nuts .
oh . we &apos;re doing good in there .
look at this .
found this metal ring in her blouse .
see this piece of her jeans ?
yeah , you think that &apos;s semen ?
tested positive .
i &apos;m running it right now .
oh , my god .
i was just picking up
my residential parking permit upstairs .
i hope it &apos;s okay .
yes , yes . it &apos;s fine .
uh , we were just breaking another case .
terrific . i stopped in because i --
well , i wanted to know if you were able to identify her .
we were .
soap mummy ?
looks to be about 10 years old .
yes .
you &apos;re amazing .
got something big , jane .
i tracked all of emma &apos;s e @-@ mail .
she took a leave of absence to try to get another job .
what ? where ?
you &apos;re not gonna believe this .
she was applying to the no cares au pair agency .
to do what ?
to be a nanny .
you recognize this woman ?
i know all my employees .
that &apos;s celia jaffe .
actually , that &apos;s emma spencer .
celia jaffe was her alias .
that &apos;s not possible .
we always run a thorough ,
multi @-@ step background check on everyone .
did you do the thorough ,
multi @-@ step background check on this employee ?
well , we checked her driving record .
so that &apos;s a no .
she came in to interview in the middle of a crisis .
a @-@ a very prominent client had just fired their nanny
and needed an immediate replacement .
emma was the perfect replacement ?
she had very hard @-@ to @-@ find skills .
she was willing to live in ,
spoke fluent french , well @-@ educated .
who was the client ?
i can &apos;t divulge that .
well , that &apos;s too bad ...
since it might be your last
when word gets out that you don &apos;t vet your nannies .
it was tom macgregor and his wife .
tom macgregor jr . , the one who &apos;s running for congress ?
you understand the need for discretion .
oh , we do .
it seems awfully coincidental
that the macgregors had to fire their nanny
the same day that emma spencer came in for an interview .
the macgregors received an anonymous phone call
saying that their nanny ,
who is 60 and someone i certainly did vet ,
was selling crack cocaine .
i guess you never know .
guess you never do .
move that over .
that anonymous phone call
reporting mary poppins , the crack dealer --
it came from emma spencer .
yeah , of course it did .
how else was emma gonna get into the macgregor fortress ?
she was looking for something .
yeah , something to connect
macgregor to isabelle &apos;s murder .
i &apos;ll grab korsak ,
do an initial interview with macgregor
before he lawyers up .
see what he says when i show him isabelle and emma &apos;s photos .
okay , i &apos;ll push the crime lab on the dna processing .
thank you for keeping the streets safe from crime , barold .
um , we have a cleaning staff , you know .
apparently , you have forgotten
the &quot; tidy desk , tidy minds &quot; song .
* tidy &apos; round your desk and chair *
* tidy , tidy everywhere *
* tidy farts and wide @-@ ee butts , i can see your underwear *
so , she likes montepulciano ,
lebanese zucchini , and science fiction .
she &apos;s a soap mummy .
no . uh , hope .
my , uh ...
my new friend .
aw , that &apos;s wonderful , maura .
and she said she &apos;d call me
once she &apos;s settled into her new home .
ooh , i was hoping those are the dna results .
not yet .
it &apos;s isabelle &apos;s tox screen .
there were traces of rohypnol in her system .
roofies . the date @-@ rape drug .
maybe isabelle was raped ,
and that &apos;s why she was murdered .
would you ever wear a skirt , frost ?
where is this going ?
hello , gentlemen .
great to have you here .
is the detectives union endorsing me ?
uh , not exactly .
do you know this woman ?
yeah , of course . that &apos;s celia .
we hired her to take care of our 6 @-@ year @-@ old .
she must not have liked it here very much .
she left after -- was it two days ?
yes . monday to wednesday .
by thursday morning , she &apos;d packed up and disappeared .
what &apos;s this about ?
mr. macgregor has another speaking engagement in 30 minutes .
we &apos;re investigating her murder .
god .
if i may -- this is a terrible tragedy ,
but mr. macgregor hardly knew ms. jaffe .
i &apos;m more concerned about my daughter .
celia wasn &apos;t here very long , but gracie really liked her .
her name wasn &apos;t celia .
it was emma spencer .
she was a recent law @-@ school graduate
who was working in the d.a. &apos; s office .
what was she doing working as our nanny ?
we don &apos;t know .
oh , i think i do .
another dirty campaign maneuver ,
courtesy of your opponent .
do you know this woman ?
no .
who is she ?
this is from primitive steel .
it has a good deal of slag in it .
remind me why i care about slag
and get to the hunch part .
well , the last time this type of steel was manufactured
was in the 15th century .
that &apos;s a gauntlet
from a post @-@ medieval scottish knight &apos;s suit of armor .
let me see this petri dish .
you think that this ring could be from chain mail
from a suit of armor ?
i think it might be from a gauntlet .
isabelle &apos;s cheek --
you &apos;re saying the murderer was wearing the gauntlet
when he hit her ?
these are the dna results .
which boston family would have
a sottish post @-@ medieval suit of armor
and need a nanny ? wait .
i &apos;m putting my thinking cap on .
does the dna belong to tom macgregor ?
how did you know ?
because i &apos;m amazing , too .
what &apos;s up , jane ?
hey , korsak , you see a suit of armor anywhere in that house ?
i do . at the top of the stairs .
all right , i &apos;m getting you a warrant . bring it back .
all right .
these are the last of the boxes from emma &apos;s lair .
i &apos;ll take these . you take those .
maura , come on . yes or no ?
1.5 centimeters .
well , a gauntlet like this
made the tool marks on isabelle dubois &apos; cheekbone .
&quot; a gauntlet like this &quot; ?
how many 16th @-@ century gauntlets
are just laying around ?
that &apos;s my job .
you &apos;re taking too long !
i want to know if there &apos;s blood .
that &apos;s blood .
found something .
isabelle and emma knew
knew tom macgregor &apos;s campaign manager , dan hargrove .
they were campers together ,
and dan was their counselor .
okay , here &apos;s a theory .
dan introduces isabelle to his friend , tom macgregor .
oh , can i try ?
what ? you just did my test .
it &apos;s guessing . you &apos;ll get hives .
it &apos;s theorizing .
tom macgregor gives isabelle rohypnol
and he rapes her .
she feels the effects of the drug
and tries getting away .
i will raise your theory .
he backhands her with the gauntlet so hard ,
it splits her face open , then panics , strangles her ,
and calls dan the fixer to get rid of the body .
i &apos;ll match and double .
isabelle &apos;s body turns up .
emma &apos;s got a problem
because she lied to the police 10 years before .
zero credibility .
has to find another way
to get justice for her dead friend .
publicly humiliate tom macgregor .
could emma have figured out from these photos
that isabelle was struck with that gauntlet ?
well , if we &apos;re still playing &quot; theory , &quot; yes .
that &apos;s what she was doing in the house .
she was looking for the gauntlet .
dr. isles , do you see something ?
i do .
arm hair caught in the chain mail .
let &apos;s get it processed .
okay , how &apos; bout we start by you telling me
when my family &apos;s antique suit of armor is gonna be returned ?
just so we &apos;re clear ,
neither one of you know her .
let me handle this , tom .
no .
and you &apos;d never met her
before she came here to work as a nanny .
we &apos;ve been through this . no .
that &apos;s weird .
seems like you &apos;d know the names of your campers .
you spent three weeks with them .
what the hell ?
isabelle wrote this note the night she disappeared .
&quot; he says he &apos;ll be my &apos; knight in shining armor.&apos;
gag me with a spoon .
but i &apos;m going tonight . &quot;
she was coming here , wasn &apos;t she , tom ?
don &apos;t answer that .
i &apos;m calling your lawyer .
might want to call yours , too .
we thought you were the desperate guy
who wanted to be isabelle &apos;s knight .
but it was you .
we found traces of rohypnol
in isabelle &apos;s remains .
you slipped her a roofie .
and then you strangled her
because she liked tom more than you .
you probably roofied tom , too .
tom ...
that &apos;s why i woke up next to a dead girl .
tom ...
you let me think i did that , you son of a --
hey , hey ! relax !
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you can &apos;t prove any of this .
we can prove you knew both of them and lied about it .
i &apos;m pretty sure we can prove you were wearing that gauntlet
when you struck isabelle .
so ...
was emma trying to get the gauntlet
when you pushed her down the stairs ?
i mean , she could trust you , right ?
you were her old camp counselor .
you &apos;d help her get justice .
here , jane .
that &apos;s blood .
and you &apos;re under arrest for the murder --
where are you going , huh ?
you are under arrest
for the murders of emma spencer and isabelle dubois .
put your hands behind your back .
i &apos;m innocent .
you &apos;re an accessory after the fact .
maybe you should have said something
instead of helping dan get rid of isabelle &apos;s body .
looks like the campaign &apos;s over , boys .
come on . let &apos;s go .
oh , should we join her ?
she &apos;s sitting by herself .
there &apos;s a reason i &apos;m by myself .
i prefer it .
well , they say the devil never drinks alone .
jane .
can i buy you a beer , sister ?
no , thank you , miss rizzoli .
&quot; the sound and the fury &quot; by faulkner .
i &apos;m enjoying it .
&quot; on the angel &apos;s wings of desire . &quot;
are nuns supposed to read that ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
nothing .
you look hot .
no , i don &apos;t .
are you having a pity party , &quot; g &quot; ?
do you -- do you want company for your pity party ?
come on .
sorry about your candidate .
yeah . me too .
guess i &apos;ll have to run myself
if i want any changes around here .
oh , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s a good idea ...
yeah . why stop at congressman ?
why not senator ?
president ?
why not ?
think of all the interns .
skirts optional .
