Emergency drill initiated.
Bug-out seal in 1 minute and 41 seconds.
Air lock engaged,
Ventilation system operational.
All is well.
I wonder if the chard is locally sourced.
Mm, you should ask. We don't want foreign chard.
It's from the gentleman.
Oh, come on.
You know, French women don't obsess over having
the occasional glass of wine when they're pregnant.
French women don't shave their underarms.
Good point.
I'll let him down easy.
She's a lesbian!
Gay!
How very open-minded of him.
She's also in her first trimester.
Pregnant.
Stop it!
Hm. Well-played.
Oh, that reminds me of something I've been meaning to bring up.
Baby's college fund.
It's never too early to start a 529 savings plan.
I mean, the tax benefits alone are worth the paperwork.
I'm sorry. I kind of dozed off there for a second.
What were you saying?
Very funny.
Rizzoli.
Dr. Isles.
Is that really true about French women?
I don't actually know. I've never been with one.
Peter Baldwin, 35, lived alone.
Nothing out of the ordinary about the house except for this.
I've always wanted one of these.
Shaggy and Scooby would be so proud.
After you, Velma.
No, she's Velma. I'm Daphne, obviously.
Maura, back me up on this?
I'm going to examine the body.
Velma.
What's in there?
Some kind of bunker.
Custom-built.
Guy went in, didn't come out.
Friend got worried and called the police.
Took fire rescue two hours to cut through that door.
I was right.
I really didn't want to be right.
You called the police?
Scott Hines, Detective Rizzoli.
I still can't believe it. Like, I just talked to him.
W-what can you tell us about this?
It's a bug-out shelter.
A bug-out shelter.
We're survivalists.
As in doomsday, end times.
These shelters are meant to be totally self-sustaining
in a worst-case scenario.
Well, how can you tell what the worst case scenario will be?
Well, it's a big topic of debate.
How so?
Well, I mean, the possibilities are endless.
You got F5 tornadoes, solar flares,
black holes, nuclear fallout.
Everybody's got different theories.
And what was Peter's theory?
Airborne toxins -- sarin gas, Agent 15.
受《禁止化学武器公约》管制
H1N1, H5N1...
Yeah, I-I think we got it.
Rita, his wife...
She died of drug-resistant tuberculosis a few years ago.
That's when he got into all this stuff.
Why was he in there yesterday?
24-hour test run.
He did them every couple of months.
But when he didn't come out at the scheduled time,
I got a bad feeling.
Okay. Thank you very much.
Okay. If this is what surviving the apocalypse looks like,
I'd rather be a zombie.
The whole place is sealed completely from the inside.
That's a re-breathing unit over there.
Recycling his own air?
Some first-class paranoia.
Extreme, but it's not unfounded.
You know, the black plague killed one European in four
In the 14th century.
Influenza killed nearly 20 million people
between 1918 and 1919.
Well, I don't think he died from the flu.
Maura, could this have been a heart attack?
Well, he has signs of vasoconstriction,
But his rigor is more advanced
than I'd expect, given body temperature.
So no heart attack.
Well, I'm more inclined to say he had some sort of a seizure,
perhaps from a potential loss of oxygen.
There's blown fuse in the ventilation unit.
That could cause a drop in oxygen.
CO2 poisoning seems like a rookie mistake
for somebody who's obsessed with being able to breathe.
And carbon dioxide poisoning isn't sudden.
You know, he would have had time to change the fuse
or simply just open the door before he lost consciousness.
But this -- it feels sudden.
So...murder?
It's suspicious.
Alone in a sealed room.
I'm not going to say he was murdered.
It's suspicious.
We have a mystery.
If only we had the mystery machine.
Really? Still with the Scooby Doo?
Zoinks!
Better get that fuse to the lab.
You realize that every episode was exactly the same, right?
A greedy millionaire dresses up as a ghost
to protect his property from a land grab.
It's a classic.
The title character is a talking dog.
Who solves crimes.
Agree to disagree.
And he was a great dane, by the way.
Hey. I'm all worried about Frankie.
I think we have a problem.
And by "We," you mean...?
Twice this week, I offered to make him dinner.
He refused.
If I call him on his phone at night, he doesn't answer.
You don't think he's... sleeping, do you?
If I ask him where he was, he gets all defensive.
I -- I mean, I think it's a girl.
Oh, ma.
Come on. The last time he kept a secret from me
was smoking cigarettes with the wrestling team
behind Papa Gino's, remember?
You do realize you're talking about high school.
Listen, can't you just find out something for me?
Okay.
But I -- I think you're being paranoid, okay?
And I don't think Frankie is smoking.
Or wrestling.
I'm not paranoid.
I'm protective.
How you doing, Frankie?
Fine.
Good.
What've we got?
Peter Baldwin was a V.P. at an electronics firm.
Talked to his co-workers -- they liked him.
Seemed like a normal guy.
Yeah, except for the whole post-apocalyptic survival thing.
What side of the door do you want to be on?
What's that?
It's a popular motto among preppers.
Oh, they seem nuts until the day the shit hits the fan,
then we all come running to them for toilet paper.
You've been doing research?
Or I'm a prepper.
I'm not a prepper.
But it's not some weird fringe group.
There's thousands of these bunkers all over the country.
Whole websites devoted to designing them.
There are websites devoted to costumes for cats.
Doesn't mean they're not crazy.
We're gonna go to CSRU, see if they found anything at the scene.
Sign this birthday card. Lisa in dispatch -- turning 40.
Mm. The dreaded "F" Word.
Okay.
40...is the new 30.
No.
40...is just a number.
No.40...
Kind of sucks.
Happy birthday. Love, Jane.
Oh, I was just gonna call you.
I've got a surprise here.
I don't like surprises.
It's a good one.
Do you want to talk about it?
We are talking about it.
We are?
Maura, we don't have time for this. I need you to focus.
Okay.
Uh, would you like to hear the cause of death?
Yes, please.
Halon gas.
What's that?
In liquefied form, it's combined with other chemicals
to interrupt the chain reaction necessary for combustion.
A fire extinguisher.
In liquefied form.
In gas form, it's odorless, it leaves no residue,
and in large concentrations, it's fatal to humans.
So he suffocated.
It would be like drowning in a room with no water.
Could this have been a freak accident?
Like a fire-safety-system malfunction or something?
You know, halon is a chlorofluorocarbon.
It's been phased out as a commercial fire suppressant.
I know of no natural sources of it.
If it was in that bunker...
Somebody pumped it in there.
He was probably dead before he could do anything about it.
Well, Mr. Airborne toxins
was supposed to be in a completely sealed chamber.
I'll have Susie take a mass spectrometer over to the bunker
and see if she can detect how the gas got in.
Okay, uh,
Frankie's supposed to go over there and meet the builder.
I'll have him tell you when.
Okay.
Is there something else?
What brought you down here?
Korsak's retiring.
What? Since when?
I don't know.
Well, what did he say?
He didn't.
Then how do you know?
I saw the retirement package on his desk.
It never occurred to me that he's old enough to retire.
You need to talk to him and get the facts.
It's possible that you're drawing conclusions too early.
I can't imagine doing this without him,
Especially so soon after losing Frost...
Look, all you know is that he is preparing for the future.
That doesn't mean that he is leaving today.
Right.
You remember where you were when Kennedy was shot?
What?
JFK.
There was a documentary on the other night.
You remember when he was shot?
Better than you do, I bet.
Well, yeah, but, I mean,
You couldn't have been that old, and...
You must have been, like -- - Old enough to know
L.B.J. was gonna send us to Vietnam.
Good news is Peter's laptop is functional.
And the bad news?
It's encrypted with pentagon-level security.
Can you get somebody to crack it?
Yeah. I-I'll get somebody.
Okay.
Um...have a look at this guy's bank records.
Large cash withdrawals at regular intervals
over the last year.
Just under 10 grand each time.
Mm-hmm. Trying to dodge IRS attention.
Regulation "D" triggers are meant
to flag drug dealers, money launderers.
Peter didn't fit those profiles.
I'm telling you, these guys hate the government.
He wouldn't want the feds
looking into what he was doing with his money,
even if it was legal.
He withdrew most of his life savings --
over 400 grand.
What would he need that kind of cash for?
Did he have any enemies? Was there somebody blackmailing him?
Neighbor saw a fistfight
between Peter and somebody named Noah
not long ago right on the front lawn.
What do guys like this have to fight over, duct tape?
Don't underestimate these guys, Jane.
Now, when I pulled his phone records,
I found calls to and from a Noah Forsythe
until a month ago, then the calls stopped.
They didn't speak again.
Let's pick him up,
see what their beef was.
All right.
Hey, I don't need to worry about you showing up to work
in a little tinfoil hat, right?
You laugh, but there's evidence
that those hats are effective against --
Do me a favor -- never finish that sentence.
Maura and I are headed to the bug-out.
All right, keep an eye out for little green men.
How many of these things have you built?
Oh, dozens.
You a survivalist, too?
No, no.
The, uh, doomsday guys trust me.
I have a lot of workarounds for building codes,
Permit rules, boring stuff like that.
Well, it must have been good business.
Yeah, they were great guys... especially Peter.
It's a real shame.
I have to admit, at first,
I thought they were all a little nuts.
Well, I have to say,
The more time I spend around pathogens,
The more sense something like this makes to me.
Well, I have a new model that blocks out microbes
down to the molecular level.
Well, how do you do that?
Micron filters, mainly.
Filters on that scale are a fortune.
How much do you charge for that model?
Actually, uh, what I'm looking for here
is how someone could pump air into the ventilation system
once the unit is sealed.
That's impossible.
Do you have an emergency valve that accessed an outside vent
in case the system failed?
No, Peter wouldn't have allowed that.
Listen, Bob, Peter died from a gas
that shouldn't have been in here.
Trying to figure out how that happened.
I built this thing according to Peter's specs.
I'm telling you -- the bunker was sealed.
Dr. Isles.
Yes, Susie?
None of our equipment is working,
And the spectroscope is on the fritz.
I can't even get a barometer reading.
Well, did you check it before we left the lab?
I thought I did.
All right, we're going to need to run some diagnostics
back at the lab.
Do you have a card?
Let me know if you want to look at that new model.
You ever build one with a shoe closet?
Want some coffee?
Why, so you can have my fingerprints on file?
There a reason I should have your prints?
Guys like you don't need a reason.
I want to ask you about Peter Baldwin.
What about him?
Word is you were close, and then you weren't.
What happened?
We had a fight.
Anything to do with all the money he paid you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
This is a record of large cash withdrawals
Peter made from his bank accounts.
On the days of those withdrawals,
we have his cellphone and your cellphone
going to the same locations at the same times, okay?
You tracked my cellphone?
You got a warrant for that?
I don't think that's what the jury's gonna focus on?
Oh, "The jury"? So, you think I killed him.
You and Peter were close.
After the falling out, you decided,
Why not use his secrets against him?
What secrets?
Whatever he was paying you to keep quiet.
Look, this is a gross misuse of taxpayer money --
spying on private citizens, tr--
Well, I will care a lot more about your politics
When I don't like you for Peter's murder.
Gold, okay?
He was buying gold from me.
You're a gold dealer?
Some preppers think that, when the banks fail,
you can roll up your paper money and smoke it.
Gold's the only sure thing.
Where'd you get it?
Estate sales mostly, internet auctions.
It's off-book, but it's not illegal.
I had my differences with Peter,
but I still like green money, and he had a lot of it.
You didn't tell me what the fight was about.
I helped him build his bug-out, and in return,
he said I could crash there if d-day ever came.
But then, he reneged
After I pooh-poohed his stupid airborne-toxic-event theory.
The fight was about how the world will end?
It's robots, obviously.
Intelligent machines, networked data.
I'm right about the robots, detective.
We're all just one keystroke away from anarchy.
I'll go back up my hard drive.
Hi. The builder any help?
None whatsoever.
Have you checked for any indication
That Peter brought the halon in with him?
Mm, how, like a delayed-release bomb?
Possibly.
Well, CSRU went through his duffel bag.
It was mostly guns and ammo.
What are you doing?
I'm looking up Korsak's service record
to see when he's eligible for retirement.
You're snooping.
This is not snooping.
Then why are you using my computer?
Because I don't want him to catch me not snooping.
When I told you to get the facts,
I did not mean to imply --
It's Frankie.
I have to go. To be continued.
She's snooping.
What do you got?
I broke the encryption code.
We think we have footage from right before Peter died.
I'm sorry, you broke the code?
I called in a favor with a techie friend.
Well, you owe that friend a six-pack.
Let me see it.
Wait, wait, right there.
Right there. Go in.
See that box behind him?
That wasn't in the bug-out.
You're right.
What would the dimensions of 400 grand in gold bars be?
One kilo is worth about 40 grand
and roughly the size of a smartphone.
So... 400 grand would be about 10 smartphones?
That's about what you could fit in that lockbox.
The wall safe was empty.
That's probably where he kept the gold
when he wasn't, you know, bugging out.
Mm-hmm, and during his practice run,
he took it in there with him,
along with his guns and his canned beans.
And somebody else took it out.
Yeah, Peter wasn't just killed. He was robbed.
Somebody got in the bunker
that nobody was supposed to get into.
The door was sealed.
What's that saying?
One door closes, another one opens?
You think there was another door?
Yeah.
And Peter was on the wrong side of it.
Right.
There's got to be a way in.
We're missing something.
We could run ground-penetrating radar over the property,
map the subsurface.
A hidden entrance might show up.
Yeah, Frankie, will you set that up for tomorrow?
Uh... now?
Yeah, now. Why, you got a date?
I have an appointment... that I can't miss.
I'll do it.
Thanks.
Uh... see you.
What's that about?
Who knows?
People have all kinds of secrets, I find.
Guess so.
Is there something you'd like to tell me?
Have a nice night?
Explain to me again
why I'm not on my couch eating nachos.
Well, this case has me thinking --
there is merit in planning for unforeseen circumstances.
You can't plan for unforeseen circumstances, Maura,
hence the term "Unforeseen."
Well, I'm talking about preparation,
not psychic interventions.
Of course you can't know what the future holds.
True, because I thought
my future held nachos, cheese, jalapeno, for example.
Which is why we need to live in the moment,
Seize the day.
What did you do?
Nothing... yet.
Triumph bonneville T100.2008.
Excellent condition and a very reasonable price.
Is this what you do when you say you're having a working lunch?
What is that?
Sidecar... custom addition.
Easy handling and, by all accounts,
a very smooth ride.
Are you starting a pedicab company?
It's for you.
Okay.
Why?
It's a great alternative-travel option.
Now, what if you go into labor
and traffic is... is gridlocked,
or we need to leave town in case of an emergency?
You know, the Triumph handles rough terrain and service roads.
We could even ride it on the sidewalk if we wanted.
Are you using this pregnancy
to satisfy one of your impulse buys?
No, I'm... I am planning for the unexpected.
And seizing an opportunity.
It won't be on the market long.
Shall we take it for a test-drive?
It's Korsak confirming the GPR tomorrow.
Have you talked to him yet?
I tried. It was not fruitful.
Yes, but did you ask him openly and directly
about what you saw?
Could we please talk about something else?
Sure.
What color helmet do you want?
I want nachos.
All right, thanks.
The guys say it'll take about a half-hour to map the property.
Why didn't you tell me you were retiring?
Who said I'm retiring?
I saw the forms on your desk.
You went through my desk?
No, they were in plain view.
Oh, really? That's what you're going with?
You got one foot out the door,
and you don't think I deserve to know?
I didn't realize it was all about you.
It's about trust, Vince.
I told you about my pregnancy.
You wouldn't give me a heads-up on this?
Has it occurred to you
what this reaction is why I didn't tell you?
Has it occurred to you
that this reaction is because you didn't tell me?
Did you pinpoint the problem?
The problem is there is no problem.
Something interfered with my equipment at the scene.
I tested everything,
and everything's working fine now.
And the software...
did you run an antivirus program?
Twice.
So, the problem is at the site itself.
This is a little out there,
but an electromagnetic field would cause problems like this,
though I didn't see anything to indicate that.
But that doesn't mean it wasn't there.
You're right.
Hi, Maura. What do you got?
An electromagnetic hatch
that could be held in place undetectably
as long as the power source is intact.
Okay, well, what am I looking for?
Redirect the radar team to inside the bug-out.
Tell them to look for a battery or a small generator.
I am on my way there with an EMF meter.
Okay.
Change of plan.
I mean, you didn't think I had a right to know?
I think I have a right to my privacy.
When did you become so secretive?
When did you become so nosy?
Have you met my mother?
You know it's 'cause you mean so much to me...
that's why I got so upset.
Oh, I know.
And I'm sorry I called you nosy.
I'm sorry I went through the stuff on your desk.
Even though it was in plain view.
I'm just trying to figure out where I'm headed.
That's why I hired a life coach.
The packet was Kiki's suggestion.
I've seen so many guys wait so long to retire
they can't enjoy it when it comes.
Kiki said filling out the forms
might help me figure out how I feel.
And did you?
Do I look like I've figured out anything?
Well, if anyone has earned the right
to enjoy their retirement, it's you, Vince.
I also applied to take the lieutenant's exam.
Really?
I'm just... considering my options.
Well, I think you'd make a great lieutenant,
just like you make a great sergeant.
Detectives...
we got something.
There's a sewer tunnel under the bunker.
Sounds like a good way to sneak in and out without being seen.
Or not.
That's Bob McGrath, the builder.
It's a lot of bodies to find
in a place designed for survival.
Bomb squad thinks he was planting a homemade C-4 bomb
but mis-wired the timer.
Trying the blow up the evidence of the hatch.
Blew himself up instead.
Okay, so, he gets himself hired to build the shelter.
Then, he modifies the plan
and leaves himself a secret entrance
so he can sneak in and snake Peter's gold.
But how did he know Peter had
the gold in there with him in the first place?
Maybe Peter told him.
Maybe Noah Forsythe told him.
Did you find the gold at Bob's house?
Yeah, and that's not all.
Insulin, antibiotics, diamonds, cartons of cigarettes.
So, Peter wasn't his first victim.
He's been pulling this stunt on all his clients.
Those that were worth his while
with stocks of commodities he thought could sell or trade.
Classic marauder.
A what?
Marauders.
They're the opposite of survivalists.
Instead of making their own plans,
they're opportunists,
roving around preying on other people.
Sounds like a "Road warrior" sequel.
Technically, "The road warrior" was a sequel.
It makes sense, if you think about it.
What's easier --
Building and stocking your own bug-out shelter
or figuring out who the guys are that have them
and then raiding those?
Okay, but if all Bob wanted to do was rob his clients --
I mean, he had a foolproof system.
Why kill Peter?
Bob was the only one who knew about the gold.
Peter would have known it was him
as soon as it went missing.
Or it could have been an accident.
Bob was lousy at building bombs.
Maybe he was no good with chemistry.
He thought he was gonna knock him out, wound up killing him.
Either way, it just seems like a lot of trouble for a box of gold.
You would be a terrible marauder.
I would not.
Are you kidding me? You wouldn't last two weeks.
I'm a survivor, thank you.
And if the chips were down,
I would step over my own mother
to get to --
She's right behind me, isn't she?
How do you do it?
Do you have the place bugged?
I heard about the bomb. Are you okay?
Are you --
Are you feeling all right?
Break room, please.
What happened to your face?
Keep your voice down, all right?
Not everybody knows, you know?
Well, maybe they should
so they stop sending you into a very dangerous situation
that could get you killed.
It's kind of in the job description, ma.
God, Jane.
Take some time off, a vacation, a leave of absence.
For nine months?
Ma, I spoke to my doctor. I'm fine.
Okay?
It's my job. I'm not gonna quit.
Well, I'm a mother, and it's my job,
and I'm not gonna quit, either.
It's Maura. I got to go.
Look, if it makes you feel better,
I think this case is wrapping up, okay?
Okay, fine.
Great.
Okay, just one last thing.
You find anything out about Frankie?
Okay, this -- this nosy thing that you're doing,
This is why Frankie doesn't tell you stuff.
This is why I don't tell you stuff.
You don't tell me stuff
because you don't know what's good for you.
You'll soon see how I feel,
and you'll know that I'm right!
You need to give yourself a raise.
You were right about the electromagnets.
I'll bring it up with the commonwealth.
Yeah, you and Frankie must have spooked Bob here
when you questioned him about the bunker.
He killed himself trying to cover his tracks.
I'm not sure I agree.
His lungs are well-aerated.
No smoke or particulate inhalation.
He was at the center of the explosion.
which means he might have been dead
when the bomb detonated.
Look at this --
subdermal hematoma consistent with being struck
with a blunt object.
Bob has a partner.
Had.
So, Bob and partner rob Peter with this trap-door scheme,
but Peter ends up dead.
Frankie and I talked to Bob.
Bob gets nervous,
Mm-hmm. Tells the partner that we're on to him.
Partner takes the opportunity
to destroy both the evidence and bob.
It really seemed like this case was over.
Clearly, that's what he wanted us to think.
"Marauder" is the French word meaning "Rascal."
All cultures have them.
Really?
Pirates, bandits -- it's a practice as old as time.
You know, the United States had a nuclear-fusion research project called marauder
which stood for "magnetically accelerated ring
to achieve ultra-high directed energy and radiation."
No shit.
Yeah.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Sure.
What's up, Chang?
Listen, Ma's always gonna give any girl you're dating a hard time,
but you can't hide this girl forever.
Just bring her around. I'll run interference.
Thanks, but...that's not what I've been doing at night.
What are you doing, then?
Computer engineering.
I've been taking courses.
How? W-when?
Night classes -- programming, data systems, repairs.
Wait a minute. The encrypted hard drive --
Was that you?
No, I'm still a novice. That was Bahar.
Bahar.
This israeli kid in my class. He's 19.
Look, Jane, they're not gonna put me in homicide
as long as you're still here.
But I could be a detective in bric.
I'm just getting my ducks in a row
so I can make a push for it.
Well, that's an... incredibly...sound plan for the future.
Thank you.
But what -- what's with all the secrecy?
I didn't think I'd be any good at it.
Frost was the best.
And I knew that you wouldn't cut me any slack
if I didn't have a handle on it.
You're doing great.
And -- and I'm -- I'm really proud of you.
And Bahar.
Thank you.
But, please, don't tell ma.
She'll just use me like I'm her personal genius bar.
Yeah, you're right.
Mm. Okay, um...
I'll handle ma.
Uh, I-I'll -- I'll just tell her you have a new girlfriend.
Just make it believable.
I'll tell her she's a stripper.
Great.
Thanks.
So, Bob and his partner
steal from Bob's survivalist clients.
We know what bob's role was. He built the secret entrances.
But who is the partner?
Another survivalist, you think?
Would explain how they knew each other.
Maybe the partner hired Bob to build his shelter.
They get to talking about all Bob's other clients,
what easy targets they'd be.
Can we track down who has these bunkers?
Bob dodged a lot of permit regulations,
so the bunkers were probably off the record.
What about theft reports
for any of the stolen goods over at Bob's house?
I checked the NCIC. There wasn't much.
Then again, you don't file a report
if you don't want people to know
what you've been stockpiling in the first place.
No, we got to find the people he robbed,
work backwards to connect them to the partner.
Well, I have a few names.
There was a woman who
reported diamond theft who lives in the area.
Let's talk to her.
What about clients from Bob's firm?
I got the list.
Well, start running background checks, see if anybody sticks out.
Do you know who took our diamonds?
We were hoping to speak to your husband, too.
Lewis would never set foot in a police station.
No offense.
You reported $20,000 worth of diamonds stolen.
Six months ago. We haven't heard anything since.
Do you recognize this man?
No.
This isn't the guy who built your bug-out?
No. Lewis built it himself.
How about this guy?
I don't think so.
Do you have a lead or not?
Because I really need to get home.
Okay, wait, wait. One more question.
Um, uh, why diamonds?
It wasn't to make you a necklace, was it?
Not even a pair of earrings.
Lewis said the diamonds were an investment.
First, he wanted to buy fuel.
I told him I'm not spending my retirement money
on propane tanks.
Who knew about the diamonds besides you and Lewis?
The gem dealer. He's based in Brazil --
The guy who referred us to the dealer, my mom.
The guy who referred you -- you remember his name?
Oh, I have his card.
Scott Hines.
Peter's friend. The one who called the cops.
Yeah, no wonder he was so broken up about his poor friend.
Police!
Go, go, go!
Clear!
Don't say it.
Looks like he bugged out.
His car's gone.
Nobody's seen him for a day and a half.
If I'm Scott, where do I put my bug-out shelter?
The dirt sample we found in scott's garage
is not consistent with the soil on his property.
So he tracked it in his tire treads from somewhere else.
It would appear so.
Though, not necessarily the same location
as the bug-out shelter.
But I don't want to make any assumptions.
What'd you find?
A significant concentration of mountain spleenwort pollen.
Excuse me?
A little fern.
It originated in the appalachian region,
and then it extended to western Massachusetts.
Frankie.
Yeah?
Can you search county clerk database
anywhere west of Springfield
to see if there's any property linked to Scott?
Sure.
It's bug out.
Bug out.
It's stupid no matter how you pronounce it.
Got something.
Looks like a couple acres in Southwick.
Uh, property deed for Hubert Hines,
deceased as of 2008.
I'll bet we know who inherited that land.
That would be a perfect place to build a cabin
for the end of the world.
Bug...out.
Bug out.
Bug...out.
Bug out.
We're in the right place.
I don't see the cabin.
There's not gonna be a cabin.
He wouldn't leave himself open to be spotted
by black helicopters or whatever else it is
he thinks is following him.
Underground.
I'm guessing this guy went down deep.
Well, everybody's got to breathe.
Does that tree stump look a little too perfect to you?
How long does it --
There!
Welcome to doomsday, buddy.
Anarchist's wife came by.
Which anarchist? Robot rebellion?
No. Diamonds are forever.
Ah. How is she?
Came to thank us.
Says her husband's gonna make her those earrings after all.
Our work here is done.
Am I the only one struck by the irony
of the people obsessed with survival
are picking each other off like flies?
This is an isolated incident.
You're still defending them?
I'm just saying.
We could all be a little bit more prepared
in case of emergency...
which is why --
...I put these together.
One for everybody.
Korsak.
Thanks.
Jane.
Go ahead. Open them up.
Okay.
Better than dry leaves.
Antibacterial...
Beef stew MRE -- gross.
And there's a couple of personalized items
for both of you.
Freeze-dried ice cream. Okay, now, this I can use.
Likewise.
We are officially prepared for the end of the world.
Y-you're eating it now?
You never know.
Sidecar... and a virgin sidecar.
Mmm. What's in a virgin sidecar?
Basically lemon juice.
Thank you.
Say Armageddon really happened.
Not you too.
Well, just as a thought experiment.
The end of the world is nigh.
What would we really need to survive?
Well, my list is a lot shorter than yours.
How do you know?
Because you would give up state secrets
if someone took away your memory-foam pillow.
That is true. I would definitely need my pillow.
And a humidifier.
Oh, and can you imagine facing down the end of the world
with bad cuticles?
Oh, I shudder to think.
Mm, so, yes. A manicure kit.
Of course.
Come on. What would you stockpile?
Jerky.
Lots and lots of jerky.
I give up.
But don't come crying to me when you get a hangnail.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said --
about planning for the baby's future.
Oh?
If something ever happens to me,
you know, something serious,
I would want you to have the baby.
I mean, would you be willing to do that?
I would be honored.
You know, the sidecar is surprisingly cozy.
Well, it's all yours.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I...spilled my drink.
Uh, yeah. I'll just get you another one.
Oh, please don't.
Bug out.
Bug out.
Bug...out.
