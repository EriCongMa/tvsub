You must be Elena.
How do we look exactly alike?
You're a Petrova doppelganger.
You're the key to breaking the curse.
The sun and the moon curse?
Vampires and werewolves used to roam freely
until a shaman put a curse on them
to limit their power.
Klaus is the real deal.
From the first generation of vampires.
The oldest vampire in the history of time is coming after me?
Katerina,I have missed you.
Klaus!
Klaus is in Alaric's body.
He's possessing it!
And while I'm gone,
you stay here,Katerina.
Elijah.
One of the originals. He's a legend.
So that's it.
As long as we keep the dagger in there,
then he stays dead.
Elijah had no weapon to kill Klaus.
But he believed that if a witch could channel their power,
it wouldn't need one.
He says if you use too much of your powers at once,
it'll kill you.
Bonnie will not die for me.
I will not let that happen.
She's the only one who can do it.
We'll find another way.
Elijah.
Katerina!
Excuse me.
Ah,good evening,Trefor.
I am pleased you could join us.
I could not miss the birthday celebration.
No,considering the gift you claim to bear.
Where is this mystery girl of which you speak?
Right this way.
My dear.
Hello.
Elijah! It's me,it's Elena.
Shh.
Oh,my god.
Forgive me. You remind me of someone.
Katerina,may I introduce
the Lord Elijah.
Pleasure,my lord.
The pleasure's mine. Katerina.
What...
I can't--I can't breathe!
What's happened to me?
Are you ok?
I can't...I can't be in this house.
You're not invited in.
You need to get me out of here.
What happened?
I'll tell you.
Not here.
Can I trust you?
Can I trust you?
Elena!
Hey.
Hey.
Have you seen Elena?
Uh,no.
Hi,sweetie.
Oh,my coffee.
Good morning.
Mm,good morning.
Hey,where's Elena?
I don't know,Stefan.
It's your girlfriend. Mine's right here.
Oh,and how's the shoulder? Got time for a bite?
I'm so hungry.
Oh,it's really messy.
Can you just use a blood bag today?
I'm already late for work.
No!
Hey,it's me. Where are you? Call me.
what are you doing?
She's not a wind-up toy.
It's really none of your business,is it,Stefan?
Yeah.
What she said.
I have to go to work.
Ugh! Bye.
Ok.
No,she didn't.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Yes,do hurry.
I'm anxious to get out of this body.
And if you get hung up,
call me. You know how impatient I get.
Where is he going?
To retrieve me.
So I can get out of this bad hair-do.
Are you sure that's a good idea,Klaus?
Well,the full moon is almost upon us.
I've killed the witch,I have the moon stone,
and the doppelganger is waiting in the wings.
Ohh,I am ready to break this curse.
And why would you do that here?
There's so many people that would try to stop you.
Because I have to.
It's the birth place of the doppelganger.
I didn't realize that was a requirement.
Well,how could you? You betrayed me
and fled England before I could give you the details,Katerina.
But I did find your birth place
and I slaughtered your family.
So I guess we're cool.
Let's just hope that Elena
isn't as stupid as you are.
She won't run.
She'll die before she lets anyone
that she loves get hurt.
And that's exactly what I'm counting on.
You can't leave until I tell you to.
You look better.
Where did you get the dagger?
I'll tell you everything.
But we have to work together,Elijah.
I need your word.
Your ability to make demands has long passed.
No demands.
I'm offering you my help.
And in return,I want yours.
And why should I even consider this?
The same reason that you haven't killed me.
You need my help to kill Klaus.
And I need you.
Where are you?
Are you ok?
Yes,I'm fine.
Where's Elijah?
He's right here.
Where? I'm on my way.
No,Stefan,Elijah and I need some time alone.
Listen to me. He can't be trusted.
He'll use you to get to Klaus.
Elijah is a noble man,Stefan.
He lives by a code of honor. I can trust him.
He knows that I'd be incredibly stupid to betray him again.
By removing the dagger,I have proven myself.
You can't do this alone.
It's my decision,
Stefan. Please respect it.
And make sure
that Damon doesn't do anything stupid.
We'll be in touch.
Did she just hang up on you?
She did.
She's lost it.
If anyone can get him to help us kill Klaus,it's her.
Bonnie's the way to kill Klaus,Stefan.
He thinks she's dead.
We have a chance with her.
She'll kill herself in the process.
Elena's looking for another way.
Her way's going to get her killed.
So we need to find her and stop her.
No, you need to back off.
What?!
Look, I don't like this any more than you do.
But we need to trust her.
We gotta just let her do her thing.
That might be your plan.
Mine's better.
I said back off.
He's here.
Klaus is here?
He's taken over Alaric's body.
Of course he has.
One of his favorite tricks.
Well, what are his other tricks?
What is he going to do next?
You're the only one who knows him.
Yes, I do.
So where is this mysterious host
I've heard so much about?
Fashionably late.
He likes to make an entrance.
Here he is.
Katerina, may I introduce to you
the Lord Niklaus.
Niklaus is the name my father gave me.
Please
call me Klaus.
Elijah!
Elena, what are you doing here?
What happened?
I've had a bit of an incident, Carol.
I'm hoping you could help.
Well, I'm on my way to a meeting, so I--
We won't take but a minute of your time.
Of course. Anything you need.
Thank you.
Well, first things first.
I'm going to need a change of clothing.
Well, we can try one of my husband's suits.
I haven't boxed them up yet.
Wonderful.
How did you know she's not on vervain?
Cause I'm the one who got her off it.
Right before you and your friends killed me.
Twice.
If you'll excuse me, I'll be down a moment.
Hello?
Hey, Stefan.
It's jenna.
Jenna, hey.
Where's Elena? And Jeremy?
No one's answering their phones.
Ah, Elena's not here at the moment.
Is ah... Is everything ok?
She left me all these weird
messages telling me to stay away from Rick.
What's going on?
It's really hard to explain over the phone, but,
she was hoping that you
could stay on campus for a little while longer.
Oh, that's kinda hard to do from my kitchen.
Wait, you're home?
Yeah. What's going on? Where's Elena?
I'm supposed to meet Rick at the Grill for lunch,
to talk.
Jenna, listen to me carefully.
Whatever you do, do not meet Alaric at the Grill.
I'm going to come over right now
and I'll explain everything.
Wow, I'd love to lend you a hand,
but you wouldn't want me doing anything stupid.
Seriously going to be like this?
You and your girlfriend are calling the shots.
I'm just backing off, Stefan.
Let's go.
Where are we going?
Splitting from the team. Going rogue.
Come on.
So I assume that the Martin witches are no longer with us.
No.
I'm sorry.
And Katerina.
She would have been released
from my compulsion when I died.
Klaus took her.
We think that she may be dead.
I doubt that.
Not Klaus' style.
Death would be too easy for her after what she did.
I don't understand.
You say that you want Klaus dead,
but you still made Katherine pay for betraying him.
I have my own reasons for wanting Katerina to pay.
There was a time...
I'd have done anything for Klaus.
From where have you come, Katerina?
I'm new to town, my lord.
Katerina is from Bulgaria.
Zradevei, Katerina.
Very good.
Do you mind, brother?
I would like to have a moment alone with her.
Not at all. Happy birthday, brother.
Yes.
Klaus is my brother.
I heard that.
I'm still processing.
Yes, I'm a little behind on the times,
but I believe the term you're searching for
is "O.M.G."
I really don't think that this is a good idea.
You're an investigative journalist.
We're investigating.
Alaric, are you home?
It's Andie Starr, Jenna's friend.
Thank god.
Wow! You were right.
She looks exactly like Elena.
Yep.
Thought you might be dead.
Unfortunately not.
Hey, Jenna. Thank you so much
for not going to the Grill.
Um, Stefan--
No,listen.
I can explain.
Hi,Stefan.
How's it going?
There's a whole family of originals?
My father was a wealthy land owner
in a village in Eastern Europe.
Our mother bore seven children.
So your parents were human?
Our whole family was.
Our origin as vampires is a very long story, Elena.
Just know... We're the oldest vampires in the world.
We are the original family,
and from us all, vampires were created.
Right, but klaus is your brother.
And you want him dead?
I need some air.
I'm still feeling a tad...dead.
Come.
What are you doing here?
We are here to rescue you.
No, sweetie.
We are here to see if she deserves to be rescued.
Right.
I figured you still might be kicking.
Alari-Klaus was blending way too easily.
Figured he had probably had some coaching.
Is that...
Vervain? Your salvation.
It's not going to undo anything.
There's always a loophole. Did he tell you
to stay in this apartment until he said it was ok to leave?
You can't say.
Did he tell you to do absolutely everything he says
until the end of time?
No.
There's your loophole.
Drink this and prevent any further compulsion.
Give it to me.
Answer one question first.
You double-crossed us with Isobel,why?
I didn't think you could stand a chance against Klaus,
So I was looking out for myself.
And where did that get you?
Here.
Be careful with that.
If he finds out you have that,
You're never getting out of here.
You owe me.
And I will collect.
Come on.
Nice to meet you.
You know,I find chopping...
Calming.
The feel of the blade in the hand,maybe.
I'm still waiting for
someone to tell me what the hell's going on.
Well, would you like to tell her,Stefan,
or should I?
Tell me what?
Do you believe in vampires,Jenna?
No?
Well,who does,right?
But believe it or not,
They do have a place in our history.
And as a history teacher,
I find them fascinating.
Why are we talking about this?
Well,you've been angry with me for keeping secrets,
And this is one of my secrets.
I'm obsessed with vampires.
There. I said it.
Are you joking?
Not at all.
How about you, Stefan?
Are you a fan of vampires?
In literature.
Bram Stoker.
It's dense, but I appreciate it.
Hmm. Did you know that vampires are the oldest creatures of the night?
Except for werewolves,of course.
Werewolves.
Werewolves.
Now I know you're joking.
You know,I've read that there's an Aztec curse
On both species.
That keeps werewolves slaves to the moon
And vampires bound by the sun.
Isn't that right,Stefan?
You know,they say these creatures would do anything to have this curse broken.
And that they wouldn't care who they had to kill to do it.
So as you've seen, nothing can kill an original.
Not sun,not fire,not even a werewolf bite.
Only the wood from one tree;
A tree my family made sure burned.
That's where the white ash for the dagger comes from.
Yes.
The witches won't allow anything truly immortal to walk the earth.
Every creature needs to have a weakness in order to maintain the balance.
So the sun can't kill an original.
Why is Klaus so obsessed
With breaking the sun and moon curse?
Right.
The curse of the sun and the moon.
It's also... Biblical-sounding, don't you think?
What's so funny?
Look,The Roman parchment.
I remember etching this scroll.
Well,I was quite blistered from drink.
Your finest work remains your Aztec drawings.
Not the African carvings?
Cause I was quite proud of those.
The Aztec.
Who can resist a shaman?
Yes.
I don't understand.
So Klaus drew the Aztec sketches about the curse?
Roman scrolls,African tribal etchings,
And any other culture or continent we felt like planting in it.
But why?
Easiest way to discover the existence of a doppelganger
or to get your hands on some long,lost moon stone
Is to have every single member of two warring species
On the lookout.
So it's not Aztec at all?
The curse of the sun and the moon...Is fake.
It doesn't exist.
What?
Oh,I know this all sounds so crazy,
But...Vampires are real.
Would you care for some more wine?
Get out.
Excuse me?
I don't know what it is you're trying to do
Or why you're saying these things,but--
Jenna.
I said get out!
You heard her.
I'm afraid I don't want to.
Fine! I'll go.
You're not going anywhere.
Stefan!
Jenna, get out of here now!
You can't kill me, Stefan.
Watch me!
Stefan!
I may not have a witch protecting me today,
But if you kill this body,
What's to stop me from choosing Jenna as my next one?
Jenna, go.
But you're--you--
I said go!
Kill me.
Just remind Elena
how easy it will be for me to get my revenge
If she tries to stop me from breaking this curse.
Klaus and I faked the sun and moon curse
dating back over a thousand years.
But if there's no curse...
There's a curse. Just not that one.
The real one's much worse.
It's a curse placed on Klaus.
What are you talking about?
Klaus has been trying to break it for the last thousand years.
You were his only hope.
What is this curse?
Your phone will not stop its incessant buzzing.
Answer it, please.
Stefan--
What's wrong?
No.
No, no, no, no.
Ok, I'll be right there.
Klaus went after Jenna. I have to go to her.
I'm afraid that wasn't part of today's arrangement.
She's my family, Elijah. I have to.
I'll be back.
You have my word.
That doesn't mean anything to me
until you live up to it.
Thank you.
You have to chase me!
You're meant to catch me.
But if I catch you, the game will be over.
Thank you for entertaining me.
You seemed lonely inside, so I took pity on you.
Klaus promised to spend the day with me,
but he never returned home from the night.
Yes, Klaus does not live by any rules but his own.
He is a very charming man.
Hard for anyone to resist, I suppose.
And yet...
I know not why he courts me.
He seems to not care about me at all.
Many a union has been built on much less.
Is it wrong to want more?
Did you have more with Trefor?
Trefor believes that he loves me,
but true love is not real unless it's returned.
Do you agree?
I do not believe in love, Katerina.
That is too sad for me to accept, my lord.
Life is too cruel.
If we cease to believe in love,
why would we want to live?
What do I interrupt?
He's returned.
Long night.
What has happened?
The wrong village picked a fight at the tavern.
Oh, Jenna, thank god.
No.
I'm so sorry.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
When I was little, your mom used to tell me bedtime stories.
Stories about vampires.
I never thought that what she said could be true.
It is true, Jenna.
I should have told you.
I thought that if you didn't know, you'd be safe.
But then things got so out of control.
And everything I had done to keep you out of it,
it just blew up in my face.
Who else knows?
Jeremy?
John?
We were just trying to protect you.
Protect me?
I'm so sorry.
I will tell you everything.
No, Elena...I am the one who's supposed to be protecting you
and Jeremy.
I know, but there's
nothing that you could have done. There's so much more to it--
No, this is-- this is so--
I don't know how-- it's--
I know, hey.
Why didn't you tell me?!
I'm scared.
I know.
I know.
I know, hey.
I'm sorry.
Jenna, I am so, so sorry.
Is she gonna be ok?
She's in shock.
I tried to tell her as much as I could,
but I barely scratched the surface.
I'm so sorry, Elena.
I hate this.
It's not your fault, Stefan.
It's mine.
Anyway...
I have to go back.
To Elijah.
Wait, what? No, no!
Stefan, I promised him that I would return.
I can't break that promise.
Oh.
Yeah.
I'll be ok.
Where do you think you're going?
Back to Elijah.
No.
Get out of my way, dam--
If you so much as try and take a step
out of this house...
Damon, easy.
Stay out of this, Andie.
Let her go.
Are you kidding me? We just got her back.
You heard me.
I said let her go.
That's twice today you've stood in my way.
I wouldn't try a third.
You mind turning that down?
Why so grumpy?
Well, this body has outlived its usefulness.
Do you want a drink?
No, Katerina, I don't want a drink.
Come on. It might loosen you up.
What I want
is for you to sit down
and shut up.
Maddox, what took you so long?
You've got a lot of luggage.
Greta. Finally.
Hello, love.
Nice body.
You ready to get out of it?
Welcome back.
Tell me.
What is Klaus' curse?
Please.
My family was quite close,
but Klaus and my father did not get on too well.
When we became vampires,
we discovered the truth.
Klaus was not my father's son.
My mother had been unfaithful many years before.
This was the darkest secret.
Klaus is from a different bloodline.
Of course, when my father discovered this,
he hunted down and he killed my mother's lover
and his entire family.
Not realizing, of course,
that he was igniting a war between species
that rages until this day.
A war between the species?
The vampires...
and the werewolves.
So Klaus' real father was from a werewolf bloodline?
What does that make Klaus?
A werewolf?
Or a vampire?
He's both.
A hybrid would be deadlier
than any werewolf or vampire.
Nature would not stand for such an imbalance of power.
Therefore the witches, the servants of nature,
saw to it that my brother's werewolf side
would become dormant.
That's the curse that Klaus wants to break?
He wants to trigger that part of him that's a werewolf.
If allowed, Klaus would sire his own bloodline.
He'd build his own race.
Endangering not just vampires,
But everyone.
But you helped him.
I helped him because I loved him.
That's changed, now he must die.
We have the dagger now. We can stop him.
When a werewolf is wounded by silver,
It heals.
An original can't be killed by anything
But white oak ash on a silver dagger.
So you see the conundrum.
The dagger does not work.
What, are you saying that Klaus can't be killed?
There's one way to kill any supernatural species--
At the hands of the servants of nature themselves.
A witch.
If they can channel that much power.
but it would kill them.
The curse must be broken during the full moon.
When Klaus is in transition.
That's when he'll be at his most vulnerable.
A witch with enough power...
Can kill Klaus.
What if I told you
that I knew a witch
That could channel that much power?
Then I would tell you
there's one more thing that you should know.
The full moon is tomorrow, brother.
After all these centuries, it is finally time.
I have been to see the witches.
They believe they may have found a way
to spare the doppelganger.
What does it matter if she lives or not?
She's a means to an end, that is all.
What, she should die for your gain?
She is human.
Her life means nothing.
I beg you to consider this.
Are you so foolish
as to care for her?
Of course not.
Love is a vampire's greatest weakness,
And we are not weak, Elijah.
We do not feel,
and we do not care.
We did once.
Too many lifetimes ago to matter.
Tell the witches not to bother.
The sacrifice will happen as planned.
You found a way to save the life of the doppelganger?
Yes, Elena.
I did.
But unfortunately,
Katerina took matters into her own hands first.
I believe you already know how that played out.
You cared about her, didn't you?
It's a common mistake, I'm told.
And it's one I won't make again.
You don't have to be so mad at your brother.
You know, he's worried about Elena, and...
Just go, please.
I know you're worried about her, too.
Andie.
Go.
Ok.
Tired of your little play thing already?
Don't start with me, Stefan.
She's just my distraction.
She's a person. You're victimizing her.
You should be thankful she's here.
She keeps me from going for what I really want.
You're right.
Thank you.
For being in love with my girlfriend.
And there it is.
There it is.
You know, you can be in love with Elena all you want
If it means that you'll protect her.
But I have the one thing that you never will.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Her respect.
Stop!
What have you done?
I don't understand.
Katerina has gone. She has fled.
No.
What did you tell her?
I told her nothing.
Do not lie to me!
I will find her.
You have my word.
If you do not,
I give you my word you will be dead.
Now you've invited him in?
Elijah and I have renewed the terms of our deal.
Really?
The two of you will come to no harm at my hands.
I only ask for one thing in return.
What?
An apology.
A what?
I'm sorry for the part
that I played in your death.
I was protecting Elena.
I will always
Protect Elena.
I understand.
Sacrifice is going to happen, Damon.
Bonnie will be able to kill Klaus without hurting herself
And Elijah knows how to save my life.
I told you I'd find another way.
And I did.
Is that true?
It is.
And you're trusting him?
I am.
You can all go to hell.
He's angry with me right now.
But he'll come around.
Perhaps.
I thought I told you to leave.
You didn't compel me.
I want to be here.
Just let me be here.
I'm upset.
And you know what happens when I'm upset.
You have to leave.
No.
You need to know that somebody cares about you.
I care about you, Damon.
Hey. Look at me.
Get out of here, before I kill you.
Just go.
Go.
Now!
Elena?
Now that's more like it.
Back to Elijah.
No.
Get out of my way, dam--
If you so much as try and take a step
out of this house...
Damon, easy.
Stay out of this, Andie.
Let her go.
Are you kidding me? We just got her back.
You heard me.
I said let her go.
That's twice today you've stood in my way.
I wouldn't try a third.
You mind turning that down?
Why so grumpy?
Well, this body has outlived its usefulness.
Do you want a drink?
No, Katerina, I don't want a drink.
Come on. It might loosen you up.
What I want
is for you to sit down
and shut up.
Maddox, what took you so long?
You've got a lot of luggage.
