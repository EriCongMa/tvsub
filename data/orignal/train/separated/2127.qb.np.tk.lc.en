we don &apos;t know .
sophie ? sophie ? where are you , sophie ?
why haven &apos;t you been watching her ?
angela ? angela ?
i found this by the back door .
it &apos;s sophie &apos;s .
her father gave it to her .
she would never take it off .
where &apos;s my daughter ?
oh , my god , where &apos;s my daughter ?
第五季 第二集
i ran you through interpol . marco reyes .
clean record , prominent real estate developer
in colombia .
uh , but that &apos;s all crap , right ?
i understand that you &apos;re upset with me
for showing myself into your home .
mm .
but i really
saw no other way to reach out to you .
well , uh ,
you know , up here we have a device called a telephone .
yeah , but some business should only be done face to face .
okay , well , let &apos;s talk then .
when your brother disappeared ,
he was in possession of a significant amount of my money .
okay , how much money ?
18 and a half million dollars .
wow . that &apos;s ... that &apos;s a lot of money .
well , i , unfortunately , don &apos;t know anything about that .
uh , i haven &apos;t seen or spoken to my brother in three years .
come here . i love you . it &apos;s been too long , huh ?
tell &apos; em about the time at the zoo .
he was causing a disturbance .
you handcuffed me to the monkey cages .
i was doing my job .
dude , you were nine !
i &apos;m sorry to hear that ,
because i &apos;m here for my money .
well , then , you &apos;ve came a long way for nothing .
detective williams ,
you ran me through interpol ,
so you know who i am .
do you really think that i &apos;m the kind of guy
who doesn &apos;t get what he wants ?
you &apos;re not listening to me .
i don &apos;t know anything about your 18 and a half million dollars .
well , then , you better go find it ... detective .
why is he coming after you if matt owes him money ?
well , i guess because he thinks i know where it is .
chin .
all right , copy that . we got to go .
what about him ?
book him for burglary .
have hpd take him on a nice , slow walk through the system .
maybe a few days in the hole
will make mr. reyes realize who he &apos;s dealing with .
so , the missing girl &apos;s name is sophie larkin , seven years old .
she was taken just before the start of her recital .
no witnesses .
what about school security ?
kidnapper attacked the security guard , fractured his skull .
sent him to the hospital in critical condition .
wasn &apos;t able to give a statement .
school &apos;s locked down . we have teams searching the area .
get out a maile amber alert right now .
you got it .
透过各种媒体向社会大众传播的一种警戒告知
hey , duke , i just sent a guy your way .
make sure he &apos;s very uncomfortable , all right ?
we &apos;ll take good care of him .
hey , chin , we got somebody going
through the security camera footage ?
yeah , csu &apos;s going through it right now .
so far , nothing .
what do we know about the family ?
lives with her parents on ford island .
wait a minute .
they &apos;re a military family ?
yeah . father &apos;s a navy seal ,
stationed overseas .
mother &apos;s a social worker .
this is one of the most expensive schools on the island .
how can they afford this place ?
sophie &apos;s here on scholarship .
okay , well , if this is about
a ransom , it &apos;s not gonna end well
when the kidnapper realizes
he grabbed the only girl whose parents can &apos;t pay .
it &apos;s assuming it &apos;s about money .
thanks so much . all right .
thank you .
hey . hey . so , the director said
that all the girls were backstage before the recital .
she didn &apos;t see anyone suspicious
and wasn &apos;t aware that sophie was missing
until the girls lined up for the show . i was gonna
go talk to some of the kids . maybe one of them saw something .
get every parent &apos;s camera and cell phone .
maybe one of them caught the kidnapper .
all right , done .
okay , child predators
do not , uh , come to fancy private schools ,
knock out security guards .
way too many variables .
they like malls , parks , places where there &apos;s less risk .
i absolutely agree .
we need to look at everybody in sophie &apos;s life .
see if there &apos;s been any threats to the family .
i mean , this could be personal .
where &apos;s sophie &apos;s mom now ?
grover took her home in case the kidnappers makes contact .
all right , have him make a list of anybody
connected to the family that may have had reason to take sophie .
and then check them for criminal records .
also , check if there &apos;s been any similar
abduction attempts in the area recently .
got it .
somebody targeted sophie for a reason .
we need to find out why .
please ...
i want to see my mommy .
what &apos;s up ? we hear anything ?
radio silence .
i don &apos;t like it , man .
we should have heard something by now .
well , we still don &apos;t know what this is about , lou .
it &apos;s looking less and less like somebody close to the family .
how do you know ?
hpd ran background checks
on everybody on the list that angela larkin gave me .
no red flags .
nothing on the larkins ?
nothing .
no dirty laundry , no threats .
these are good folks .
you know , the father &apos;s overseas defending our country .
and then , something like this happens .
man , it pisses me off .
how &apos;s the mom doing ?
daughter &apos;s missing ,
husband &apos;s 4,000 miles away .
do the math .
best thing we can do
for her is just
keep the information flowing .
believe me , not knowing where things stand--
that &apos;s what tears you up the most .
ma &apos;am , we know your husband is overseas .
have you spoken to him ?
we skyped with him this morning .
i think he was heading out on a mission .
he never tells me , but i can always sense it .
i called his c.o. , but
haven &apos;t heard back .
ok .
i hate the thought that he doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
look , we &apos;re gonna do everything we can
to get you in touch with him .
you know the drill , commander .
jeff &apos;s team is down range , his position is classified .
there &apos;s no way they &apos;re gonna be able to get a hold of him .
there has to be something i can do .
i can &apos;t just sit here and do nothing .
actually , we need you to just stay here by the phone .
but we got the best people on this .
mrs. larkin ,
you and your husband are &apos; ohana to me .
okay ? i &apos;m going to do whatever it takes
to find sophie and bring her home to you .
thanks .
what are you thinking ?
if lieutenant larkin is on a mission ,
i &apos;m thinking whoever took her is trying to compromise the op .
okay , it &apos;s a good theory . how do you prove it ?
it &apos;s not the answer i was looking for .
i didn &apos;t say anything .
yeah , you did . comon .
now , you know i can &apos;t confirm
whether lieutenant larkin &apos;s on a mission , commander .
what i can tell you is ,
there have been no security breaches
on any of our current ops .
okay , um , sir ,
lieutenant larkin &apos;s daughter was kidnapped
just two hours ago , all right ?
we believe that the mission that he either is or is not on
could be the key to getting her back .
that may be so ,
but i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s got nothing to do with our ops .
you &apos;re just gonna have to take my word on that .
yeah , with all due respect , sir ,
we &apos;ve , uh ... we &apos;ve been down this road before , you and i ,
and ...
oh , you owe me .
well , you did save my ass with that chinese satellite .
that much is true .
you &apos;re welcome .
but , unfortunately ,
i &apos;ve said all i can on this matter .
what about his files ?
can you give us access to his files ?
i can do that .
okay .
if his daughter &apos;s kidnapping
has anything to do with his service ,
there &apos;ll be a list of suspects there .
uh , one more thing , i &apos;m sorry-- um , angela ,
his wife , uh , has been trying to get in touch with him .
is there any way we could make that happen ? that would be nice .
i &apos;m sensitive to the situation , detective .
truly , i am .
and i &apos;m sure as soon as lieutenant larkin is available ,
he &apos;ll contact his wife .
let &apos;s go .
thank you .
we take an oath , danny .
i understand that .
but this is about the guy &apos;s family .
you don &apos;t think he &apos;s got a right to know ?
of course he has a right to know , all right ?
but right now his team needs him focused and ready to lead .
you tell him about his daughter , you could put all their lives
in danger and compromise the entire mission .
well , let me tell you something that you don &apos;t know ,
okay ? as a parent ,
when your child is in trouble ,
you can sense it . you know about it .
like right now , lieutenant larkin ,
he knows that . he doesn &apos;t know why ,
but he knows it . don &apos;t you think that puts
him and his team
in just as much danger ?
hi , maggie . so , i &apos;ve been talking
to some of the other girls from the recital .
do you think it would be okay if i asked you some questions ?
so , one of the other girls said
that she saw you and sophie go
to the bathroom together before the show
but that you came back alone .
now , is that true ?
okay , so when did you last see sophie ?
it &apos;s okay , baby .
it &apos;s okay .
i left the bathroom .
there was a man .
he was with sophie .
okay , you &apos;re doing great .
can you tell me what he looked like ?
i only saw his back .
they were walking away .
was he tall or short ?
tall .
and what color was his hair ?
like my daddy &apos;s .
brown ?
he was wearing a blue baseball hat .
mahalo , maggie .
hey , you &apos;re a brave girl .
we &apos;d like to take her home now .
is that okay ?
of course .
thank you .
so , have security go through the tapes
and see if they can find anyone that matches the description
maggie gave us .
and then get it out to the media .
got it .
thanks .
so , all the doors in this school
require a keycard for entry or exit , right ?
i had security compile a list
of all the card swipes from this morning .
six feet , brown hair ; that matches the description
i just got . who is he ?
guy &apos;s name is ben sutor .
he &apos;s a substitute teacher here ,
but he wasn &apos;t scheduled to work today .
his card was swiped , though ,
15 minutes before the recital started and then again
minutes after sophie disappeared .
i got blood .
he &apos;s alive .
all right , so the kidnapper targets the teacher ,
uses his card to hit the school
and grab sophie .
i don &apos;t get it . you don &apos;t go through
all this trouble unless you have an end game , right ?
so why hasn &apos;t the kidnapper made contact ?
hello ?
mr. porter , i have your daughter .
i want $ 1.6 million .
i &apos;ll call back in 30 minutes with more instructions .
you call the police , she dies .
what &apos;s wrong ?
maggie ... ?
you did the right thing , calling us .
i &apos;m steve mcgarrett . this is detective williams .
hi .
what &apos;s going on ?
your daughter and sophie ,
they went into the bathroom together .
they had the same outfit on , same hairstyle .
sophie wasn &apos;t their target .
maggie was .
they took the wrong girl .
the owner is extremely motivated .
this house will not be on the market long .
you hear that ?
no , i don &apos;t hear anything .
there .
i hear it , too .
it &apos;s coming from right over ...
here .
oh , that .
that must be the air conditioning ,
and those repairs can be factored right into the closing costs .
you guys hear that ?
jerry .
we &apos;ve talked about this .
you &apos;re not supposed to be here when i &apos;m showing .
at first , i thought it might be the pipes ,
but there &apos;s no running water , so it can &apos;t be that .
okay , i assure you that there is nothing wrong with the plumbing .
what is that thing ?
this ... is an emf reader .
measures telekinetic activity .
you know ...
ghosts .
please !
let me explain .
sorry it didn &apos;t work out !
so , your mom finally did it , huh ?
yeah , moneypenny wasn &apos;t bluffing .
bought a place on maui .
said she wants to be closer to her family .
how am i supposed to take that ?
well , there comes a time when moms finally leave the nest , jer .
yeah , but things were going so well .
then she pulls this .
right when i &apos;m on to something huge .
oh , right , steve and danny told me about the , uh , bookstore .
not a bookstore , chin .
it &apos;s a front for a counterfeiting operation .
it &apos;s only a matter of time before i prove it .
i &apos;m sure you will .
but , uh , listen , that &apos;s not why i &apos;m here .
i need your help , jerry .
a little girl was abducted
this morning from a hula recital .
yeah , whatever i can do .
of course , my expertise in abduction
is more of the extraterrestrial variety ,
but , uh , hit me .
well , we confiscated all the cell phones
and the camcorders from the parents ,
hoping we &apos;d get an image of the kidnapper ,
but now we &apos;ve got hours and hours of footage to go through ,
and i &apos;ve got every available hpd on the ground
looking for the kid .
so you want me to comb through the footage .
you got the time ?
yeah , the agent &apos;s not showing the place again till tomorrow .
relax . act normal .
someone may be watching .
good .
now sign for the package .
bring it straight to steve mcgarrett .
now thank me and head back inside .
thank you .
so , have you received any threats recently ?
no .
what about work ?
any trouble at work ?
commander , we make children &apos;s products--
strollers , car seats , highchairs , that sort of thing .
everyone in our company is like family .
i mean , the only thing we argue about is where to go for lunch .
sorry . she said to give you this .
great . thank you .
here &apos;s what happens next .
when the kidnapper calls back ,
we &apos;re gonna run a trace .
now , he spoke to you last time , eric ,
so you &apos;re gonna talk to him .
you need to keep him on the line as long as possible , okay ?
what am i supposed to say ?
he &apos;s gonna ask you if you have his money .
you &apos;re gonna tell him you &apos;re in the process of getting it ,
but before you can go any further ,
you need proof of life .
angela larkin is on her way over right now
to verify sophie &apos;s voice .
all right , once she confirms it &apos;s sophie ,
you go along with what he says ,
tell him you &apos;re gonna give him the money .
okay .
all right , call &apos;s in a couple of minutes .
you okay ?
not really .
hey , look , um , i have a daughter .
all right ? her name is grace .
she &apos;s just a little bit older than maggie .
um , if you &apos;re anything like me ,
i know there &apos;s nothing you wouldn &apos;t do
to protect your kid , right ?
yeah , but what if i screw up or ...
you know , say the wrong thing or ...
you &apos;re not gonna screw up .
okay ? look , i know that you are scared ,
but i &apos;m telling you , if this was your daughter ,
you would put all that fear aside
and do whatever you had to do to protect her , right ?
so it &apos;s easy . you just stick to the script .
we got your back . we &apos;re right here .
it &apos;s gonna be fine , all right ?
okay .
all right , good .
all right , eric , eric .
you ready ?
hello ?
do you have the money , mr. porter ?
yeah , i &apos;m getting it ,
but first i need to know that maggie &apos;s okay .
let me speak to her .
say hello .
mommy ?
mommy , i want to come home .
she &apos;s okay for now .
where &apos;s the money ?
i &apos;m getting it , but it @-@ it &apos;s gonna take a couple hours
to raise that amount in cash .
so please , please don &apos;t hurt her .
two hours .
not a minute more .
once you have the money ,
i &apos;ll give you the location where to bring it .
don &apos;t test my resolve , mr. porter .
i will kill her .
do you understand ?
yes .
good .
did it work ?
he &apos;s using a burner phone ,
so it &apos;s impossible to get an exact address .
we got nothing on voice recognition .
okay , uh , $ 1.6 million is a very specific number .
does that mean anything to you guys ?
no . no .
no , not to me .
that &apos;s a lot of money , uh , to get in a couple hours .
even with the governor &apos;s help .
we ... we &apos;ll get you the money .
i just need to make some calls .
thank you , both . so much .
hang in there , okay ?
we &apos;re gonna get sophie back .
what is it ?
okay , the porters are worth $ 50 million , right ?
the kidnapper thinks that he has their only kid
and he asks for $ 1.6 million . why ?
why so little ?
hey , brah , get over here .
what , did you find something ?
you know it .
this was taken outside the school before the recital started .
behind the hula girl .
silver beemer . check him out .
blue baseball cap .
matches the witness description .
i am like a rabbit &apos;s foot , aren &apos;t i ?
you are definitely a good luck charm .
now slide over .
facial recognition .
total violation of our first amendment rights .
cool .
ooh , i also got a partial license plate .
six @-@ z @-@ a @-@ e.
all right , well , that along with the make and a color
ought to be enough to get us a match .
let &apos;s see .
and there it is .
reported stolen this morning .
hpd already found it abandoned in chinatown .
hey , there we go .
assault , burglary , weapons possession .
just paroled out of halawa six months ago .
michael wiley ,
get out of the vehicle .
keep your hands where we can see them .
out of the car . right now , let &apos;s go .
nice and slow .
he &apos;s dead . come on .
sophie ?
sophie ?
sophie ?
sophie ? sophie ?
sophie ?
danny ...
she was here .
all right , this doesn &apos;t make sense .
wiley was expecting a pay day .
there &apos;s no way he &apos;d let sophie out of his sight before he cashed in .
unless he realized he had the wrong girl and decided to cut his losses .
i just got off the phone with the porters .
i sent them a photo of wiley .
they don &apos;t recognize him .
keep digging .
there &apos;s got to be a connection .
he &apos;s definitely the one calling them , though .
csu recovered his burner phone .
and on that phone , over the past few hours ,
there are two outgoing calls to the porters ,
as well as multiple calls going in and out to a second burner phone .
csu &apos;s still looking for that phone , but it was turned off .
aha , all right . so wiley &apos;s got a partner .
whoever that is has sophie .
the kidnapper &apos;s gonna call back in half an hour with the location of the drop .
i &apos;m thinking , since wiley did not have sophie with him ,
he was headed to pick up that money .
which means his partner was the one
who was gonna make that call .
well , and as far as the partner &apos;s concerned ,
everything is still a go .
if wiley &apos;s partner tries to get in touch with him ,
he &apos;s going to know that something &apos;s wrong .
he &apos;s liable to panic and then kill sophie .
that &apos;s why we keep what happened here quiet .
thanks , jerry . look , i appreciate your help ,
but you really didn &apos;t have to stick around .
are you kidding ? research is my super power .
oh , by the way ,
i &apos;m pretty sure i broke captain america &apos;s printer .
also pretty sure he never used it .
found it under a plant .
captain america ?
yeah.that &apos;s my little nickname for mcgarrett .
i like it .
okay , so did you find anything ?
you said we were looking for a connection
between the porters and the ransom demand .
well , here is a $ 1.6 million severance package
paid by the porters &apos; company to an employee named alan pollard .
let me look at that .
pollard was the lead engineer at the porters &apos; company up until two years ago .
he designed an energy @-@ absorbing foam
which revolutionized car seat safety ,
put the porters on the map .
a month before the ipo , he just suddenly left the company .
it doesn &apos;t say here why .
and that &apos;s because pollard signed a confidentiality agreement .
which , in my experience , tells me that he was paid to keep quiet .
what experience ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
are you okay ?
yeah . i &apos;m great .
look , i &apos;m just saying that this was a corporate cover @-@ up . trust me .
okay .
all right , so pollard &apos;s forced out before the company hits it big .
which means he missed out on a huge pay day .
looks like he found a way to make up for his losses .
what @-@ what if we do it the other way ? what if i ...
alan pollard !
drop the cell phone ,
put your hands on your head !
shut your mouth , turn around , interlock your fingers !
turn around !
go ahead , i got him .
sophie !
sophie ! can you hear me ?
where &apos;s sophie ?
where &apos;s sophie ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
no ?
boat &apos;s clear .
no sign of the girl .
let &apos;s talk .
yeah , roger that . we &apos;re on the way .
no , no , no , duke , please ,
you did everything you could and i appreciate it , all right ?
all right . thanks , buddy .
marco reyes ?
yeah .
his lawyer showed up , arranged for bail .
so he &apos;ll be out in a couple of days .
what are you going to do ?
i am gonna give him a ride to the airport .
what did chin say ?
sophie wasn &apos;t on pollard &apos;s boat .
doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s not involved .
right . chin and grover are pressing him now .
we need to do the same with the porters ,
when angela is not around .
i &apos;m telling you ,
there &apos;s no way alan could be involved .
why didn &apos;t you tell us about him
when you heard the amount ?
i mean , you had to know your company
paid him $ 1.6 million when he left .
alan was with us from the very beginning .
when he decided to leave ,
we cashed out his shares . that was ...
that was ... two years ago . we didn &apos;t remember the amount .
and you made him sign a confidentiality agreement .
why ?
it was a standard non @-@ compete clause .
our attorney insists everyone
leaving the company sign one .
look , we wouldn &apos;t deliberately withhold information from you .
we have nothing to hide .
like i said ,
i got my problems with the porters ,
but i would never kidnap their daughter .
you mean the problem where they bought you out for $ 1.6 million ,
but the company ended up going public a month later ,
costing you twice as much ?
no , man .
my issues with the porters are more , uh ,
spiritual than financial .
well , if you feel like confessing something ,
now would be the time .
we got a little girl &apos;s life at stake .
two years ago , we crash tested a new car seat .
that &apos;s when i discovered a defect in my design .
there was an incident where a latch strap
came loose from the anchor
during a high @-@ impact collision demo .
it only happened once in 100 tests .
but i wrote a memo
detailing my findings .
recommended we hold off on releasing the first order
of 50,000 seats until we figured out what happened .
i take it the porters
didn &apos;t respond too well to that memo .
i was told my findings didn &apos;t warrant such drastic measures .
that , uh , pushing the delivery date
would cost the company millions
and they &apos;d have to lay off a bunch of employees .
they had a deal in place with a major chain .
and if we didn &apos;t meet our delivery date ,
they &apos;d take their business elsewhere .
since the test only happened once ,
the company deemed the defect was human error .
and you shipped those car seats anyway , didn &apos;t you ?
they convinced me it was possible
they were right and i was wrong .
all i could do was fix the problem moving forward
and hope to god nothing happened .
something did happen , didn &apos;t it ?
there was an accident .
a driver lost control .
crashed on the 93 .
his two @-@ year @-@ old daughter was in the back seat .
she was killed on impact .
eric ... keep it simple .
you got the money , you &apos;re ready to make a trade .
okay , you good ?
okay
all right .
hello ?
i told you no cops , mr. porter .
you didn &apos;t listen .
i have your money .
just tell me where to meet you .
shut up ! we &apos;re done talking .
now hand the phone over to the cops .
there are no cops here .
tell them to get on the phone right now
or i kill her .
this is mcgarrett with five @-@ o.
where is michael wiley ?
i don &apos;t know anything about him .
you &apos;re lying .
he was supposed to be here for the call
and he never showed up .
he wouldn &apos;t walk away from this ,
which means you have him .
the porters have done everything you asked .
we have your money .
we just want their daughter back .
let &apos;s stick to the plan .
i have a new plan .
mrs. porter &apos;s gonna deliver the money .
and if i even sense the police are nearby ...
there &apos;s no way we &apos;re gonna let mrs. porter go in alone , okay ?
i will deliver the money .
you &apos;re not listening to me .
send the wife or this ends now .
okay .
manana trail .
30 minutes .
once i have the money ,
i &apos;ll give you the girl &apos;s location .
no , no , no .
we &apos;re not handing over the money
unless maggie is there .
you don &apos;t have a choice .
all right , so it &apos;s just like we talked about .
you drop the duffle bag off at the location ,
get back in your car , come back home .
that &apos;s it .
look , we @-@ we all want to get sophie back ,
but i @-@ i can &apos;t let my wife do this .
it &apos;s not safe , sending her out there alone .
eric , there &apos;s no other way .
i &apos;m going to be fine .
eric , she &apos;s not going to be alone , okay ?
we &apos;re gonna be watching her
on a surveillance satellite the entire time .
that means eyes on the drop location .
as soon as the kidnapper gets the cash ,
he &apos;s gonna lead us to sophie .
i &apos;ll be fine .
promise .
after the accident , investigators said
the little girl died because the father
failed to properly install her car seat ,
but he swore he fastened it correctly .
you knew he was telling the truth !
the parents of the little girl sued ,
but there was no evidence the seat was faulty .
yeah , the porters made sure of that
by paying you off , didn &apos;t they ?
i wanted to come forward ,
but the crash test data , along with my memo ,
were destroyed .
the company &apos;s lawyers told me
if i said anything ,
they would deny that i warned them about the defect .
that i would be criminally liable .
they gave me a choice .
accept the payout or go to jail .
you wanted to come forward ?
you realize
those faulty car seats are still out there
with children in them .
i fixed the defect on the next shipment .
there hasn &apos;t been another incident .
i never touched that money .
there isn &apos;t a day that goes by
i don &apos;t regret what i did .
let me ask you something .
during the litigation , did the girl &apos;s parents
ever find out that you were paid off ?
no .
but i told the father .
three weeks ago ,
i came across his wife &apos;s obituary in the advertiser .
she died of cancer without ever ...
knowing the truth about her daughter .
i reached out to her husband ,
confessed everything ,
even offered him the 1.6 million the porters gave me .
but he didn &apos;t want it .
said it wouldn &apos;t bring back his daughter .
listen , man .
if i ever lost my kid that way ,
it would haunt me for the rest of my life .
we need his name , alan .
jason hollier .
this was never about the money .
this guy &apos;s looking for revenge .
where the hell is this guy ?
chin , what &apos;s up ?
steve , we &apos;ve got an i.d. on the kidnapper .
his name is jason hollier .
his daughter died in a car accident on the h93
when her car seat malfunctioned ,
and that car seat was manufactured by the porters .
get this .
his wife &apos;s maiden name is wiley .
our dead kidnapper , michael wiley ,
that was her brother .
call hpd .
get them over to hollier &apos;s house right now .
okay , there &apos;s one more thing , steve .
according to pollard ,
caroline porter covered up evidence
and paid him off to avoid a trial .
you didn &apos;t know .
huh ? no .
that &apos;s why they wanted caroline to bring the money .
yeah , this is all a setup .
they &apos;re going after her .
caroline , you gotta get out of there .
he &apos;s coming after you .
get in .
now !
okay ! okay .
okay .
okay , i got a lock on her phone signal .
where &apos;s he taking her ?
they &apos;re headed north on old pali road .
if hollier wants to kill caroline ,
why &apos;s he taking her hostage ?
he blames her for his daughter &apos;s death .
so maybe he &apos;s got a couple of things
he wants to get off his chest before he kills her .
chin said hollier &apos;s daughter died on h93 , right ?
that &apos;s right , why ?
that &apos;s where he &apos;s going .
call kono .
we got to know exactly where that accident happened .
we find them , we find sophie .
that little girl you took ,
she &apos;s not my daughter .
i know .
my brother @-@ in @-@ law grabbed the wrong girl ,
but it didn &apos;t matter .
i knew as soon you heard 1.6 million ,
you &apos;d do whatever i said
before you &apos;d admit to killing my daughter .
you have to believe me , i never meant for that to happen .
but it did .
and you could &apos;ve stopped it .
the little girl , what did you do to her ?
she had nothing to do with this .
i know that .
i wanted to take your girl
so you could feel what it &apos;s like to lose a child .
pull over .
pull over here !
it never leaves me . what happened here .
i relive it every single day .
after the crash ,
i called out to olivia .
olivia !
but she didn &apos;t answer .
the report said on impact , the seat came loose .
the force was so strong it broke her neck .
i am so sorry .
they said it was my fault .
that i didn &apos;t lock her in right .
you killed my daughter .
you did !
i &apos;m sorry .
get out .
please .
i &apos;m not gonna ask you again .
okay . okay .
keep walking .
okay !
there . now turn around .
please don &apos;t .
please don &apos;t do this .
drop the weapon .
drop the weapon , jason .
you got to drop that weapon right now .
we know about the accident .
we know it wasn &apos;t your fault .
you got to drop that weapon right now .
easy .
do you have any idea how it feels to lose someone you love ?
to live with the guilt that it &apos;s your fault ?
no , i can &apos;t imagine what that must feel like .
no , you can &apos;t .
listen , no parent should
have to go through what you went through .
what do i have to live for ?
listen to me , there &apos;s a family out there right now
and they want to see their daughter .
i know you don &apos;t want to put them through the pain
of having to bury that kid .
i know that &apos;s not what you want , right ?
i just want my little girl back .
i know you do , okay ?
and i wish i could give you that , but i can &apos;t .
look at me , buddy , you made your point today .
okay ? what happened with olivia , after she died , it was wrong .
okay ? but this is over now .
this has to stop . put down the gun .
tell us where sophie is .
it &apos;s the right thing to do .
let &apos;s go . come on .
good , relax .
good news is you &apos;re all right .
bad news is you &apos;re gonna need a lawyer .
please tell that little girl i &apos;m so sorry .
where is she ?
do you have my money ?
look , i strongly suggest
that you just get on a plane and never come back .
as soon as i get my money , that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ll do .
i don &apos;t have your money .
i don &apos;t know how many times i got to tell you
i don &apos;t know where it is . i don &apos;t have it .
that &apos;s the funny thing because matthew tells a very different story .
of course , people tend to say anything
when they have a gun to their head .
where is he ?
you got my brother ? where is he ? huh ?
someplace you &apos;ll never find him .
unless i get my money .
