第一集
help !
he &apos;s coming , my prince ! he &apos;s coming !
we need your help !
please , sir .
our kingdom is in great danger .
we need the savior .
i &apos;m sorry . he &apos;s not seeing anyone today .
what &apos;s wrong with him ?
jafar .
please ! no !
pathetic .
the great savior -- hiding .
this is a sad day , indeed .
please -- don &apos;t hurt him .
i heard , but i had to come see for myself .
look at the great aladdin now .
and to think you could have escaped this fate .
you &apos;re gonna kill me ...
just get it over with .
no , not a chance .
i want to savor this .
do you remember when we first met ?
you were nothing but a common thief .
but you had honor .
despite what you did to me .
the irony &apos;s delicious .
it took becoming a hero for you to completely come apart .
but that &apos;s what always happens to saviors , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s the fate of saviors .
you give and give ...
and give ... and for what ?
they pick the fruit , they cut the branches ,
and all that &apos;s left is this ... shaky stump .
that &apos;s why you never , ever hear these words about a savior .
&quot; they lived happily ever after . &quot;
do take care , aladdin .
oh , wait . what about henry ?
he &apos;s with regina .
good .
wait ! what about my parents ?
they have no interest in walking in on this .
believe me .
and my leather jacket ?
no , it &apos;s fine .
? really ?
yeah , i like the red leather jacket .
what the hell ?
what in the hell is that ?
it &apos;s a dirigible -- from the land of untold stories .
what &apos;s it doing in our town ?
i believe you mean my town .
this is not your town .
oh , tell that to the dark one . he gave it to me .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i must prepare for my friends &apos; arrival .
regina ?
emma .
my evil half is gone . i don &apos;t know how strong i am .
evil did not make you strong . let &apos;s do this .
muttonchops !
a word of advice --
do be careful .
nothing more dangerous than an untold story --
and the people who don &apos;t want them told .
hello ?
nobody in here .
where the hell is everyone ?
somewhere out in the forest .
it &apos;s hard to tell exactly how many people there are , but look .
from the spacing of their steps , they were running .
now they &apos;re out there , scattered .
what does hyde want with them ?
it &apos;s hard to tell .
depending on who he brought with him ,
these stories playing out could create chaos .
well , that &apos;s helpful .
but all may not be lost .
you recall the orderly &apos;s baton we used
to subdue hyde in our realm ?
well , that same technology made the dirigible .
with the wreckage , i may be able to scavenge
what i need to make a weapon that could work on him .
it &apos;s the only thing i &apos;ve ever seen that can bring him down .
well let &apos;s get salvaging .
hey , emma , you okay ?
luv ? what happened ?
nothing .
come on . let &apos;s keep going .
all right , mr. hyde .
you have the keys to storybrooke .
now tell me what i want to know .
how can i wake belle ?
there is a place called the temple of morpheus .
in it , you will find sands
that will allow you to walk in belle &apos;s dreams .
then you &apos;ll be able to wake her .
who are you ?
i &apos;m morpheus .
welcome to belle &apos;s dreamworld .
would you like to wake her up ?
zelena ?
regina !
welcome to the madhouse .
what is going on ?
i &apos;m just unpacking .
what &apos;s happening out there ?
rumple handed the town over to hyde .
say , sounds like it &apos;s time for a showdown ,
doesn &apos;t it , sweetness ?
now have a nice nap
while mummy helps barbecue mean old mr. hyde .
uh , you should ... stay here .
hyde is impervious to whatever i throw at him ,
so we have to play defense .
well , you kept me in worse prisons .
i &apos;ve said i was sorry about that .
i &apos;m joking .
seriously , you opened up your home to us ,
so for as long as we &apos;re here , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m so grateful .
it &apos;ll be good for us .
i &apos;ve got something for you .
roland gave me something of robin &apos;s
that he wanted to give to you .
really ?
yeah , it was , um , it &apos;s a feather
from one of his arrows .
so sweet .
you know what ? i , um ... i remember now .
i put it away somewhere extra specially safe .
don &apos;t even worry about it .
a @-@ a little chaos is normal .
i &apos;m just going to put a protection spell
around the house and over the vault and --
and you can ...
find the feather ?
i &apos;ll find it .
so ... you &apos;re not angry ?
&apos;course not .
looks safe and sound to me .
hyde &apos;s not getting into my vault .
well , we may not have to worry about him anymore .
jekyll finished his weapon .
handy one .
eager to defeat his better half , is he ?
yeah , he is .
how are you dealing with that --
the whole &quot; destroying your evil half &quot; thing ?
i &apos;m fine .
better than fine . it &apos;s --
did i mention i &apos;m fine ?
well , something &apos;s bothering you .
all right , yes .
something is gnawing at me .
something with red hair and a fondness for pointy hats .
your sister ?
look , this may sound petty ,
but roland gave her something of robin &apos;s to give to me ,
and she already lost it .
a feather from his arrow .
i know you . this isn &apos;t about a feather .
i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s about .
well , whatever it is , just talk to her about it .
put it out in the open , deal with your pain .
maybe .
but right now , let &apos;s get hyde the hell out of town .
oh , don &apos;t avoid this .
i &apos;m not .
but you of all people should know --
heroism comes first .
emma ? ready ?
yeah .
mr. hyde !
why don &apos;t come out and take what you really want ?
or shall i deprive you the pleasure you seek
and kill him myself ?
regina .
here &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen --
leave town , and jekyll is all yours .
the problem is , my work is here -- in storybrooke ,
and it &apos;s only just beginning .
so how about i alter the deal ?
i take jekyll and keep storybrooke ,
and you avoid embarrassing yourself ,
because while everyone was afraid of the queen ,
you -- not quite as much .
no deal .
emma !
emma !
emma !
emma ! !
specially made .
you won &apos;t be breaking out of those .
are you okay ?
is something wrong ? why did you hesitate ?
nothing &apos;s wrong . i &apos;m fine .
are you really , savior ?
shut up . you &apos;re our prisoner now .
ignore him , emma .
yes , ignore me -- just like your tremors .
wait . wait . wha-- what do you know ?
more than you .
if you wish to learn what &apos;s been happening to you ,
you know where to find me .
archie .
pongo ! hey !
what are you guys doing here ?
well , i heard you were out looking for new arrivals ,
and i thought maybe , uh ... maybe you want some coffee .
my parents sent you .
yeah .
uh , they -- they &apos;re a little worried about you , emma .
t @-@ they thought it might be easier for you to talk to --
a cricket ?
sorry . i didn &apos;t mean that like i was , like , anti ... cricket .
i just --
i &apos;m not really in the mood for therapy right now .
and i &apos;ve found , usually , that &apos;s when people need it the most .
you &apos;ve been fighting bad guys for years without a break .
when i met you all those years ago ,
you had nothing but walls around you to protect you .
but since then , with henry and your family and hook ,
those walls are down .
isn &apos;t that a good thing ?
of course it is .
but it also let in all the collateral damage
of all that fighting .
great . then how do i fix that ?
with time ...
and -- and some hard work .
can &apos;t you , like , give me a pill or something ?
when it comes to fixing our biggest problems ...
emma , there are no shortcuts .
so , you &apos;ve taken me up on my offer .
smart girl .
keep calling me &quot; girl &quot; and see how that works out for you .
why don &apos;t you take these off of me
and see how that works out for you ?
you said you knew what was wrong with me .
prove it .
emma .
you were a prisoner once . you know how this works .
what makes you think i was in prison ?
i was a warden .
i know that caged look .
that &apos;s a look that doesn &apos;t quite fade .
so you must know that prisoners respond
to carrots and sticks , and you brought neither .
next time , try a bottle of syrah and two glasses .
you have no idea how to help me .
i know about the battle --
the one in your mind &apos;s eye .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry -- i thought you were just leaving .
you &apos;re right .
i was in prison .
the worst part about it was the loneliness .
it sucked .
especially for a guy like you , who likes to talk so much .
so , you can either tell me what you know ...
or i &apos;ll walk out of here ,
and i will not come back with wine .
i just won &apos;t come back .
nobody will .
you can just sit here in silence ,
and you can ...
... rot .
so you did come with a stick after all .
that &apos;s very impressive , savior .
except for one small thing .
you are afraid of me , aren &apos;t you ?
don &apos;t worry .
i brought someone who can help fix your problem .
if you want to find them , just follow the red bird .
the red bird ?
the question is , are you truly ready
to face your own story , savior ?
here we are .
my castle .
why would belle want to dream about this place ?
usually , our dreams pick us ,
not the other way around .
rumplestiltskin .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be back from your journey so soon .
don &apos;t be angry , but i don &apos;t have the tea prepared .
i @-@ i can have some ready in no time .
let her go .
she &apos;s lost in the dream .
in her mind , she &apos;s still a servant ,
and you &apos;re still a beast .
it &apos;s fascinating , isn &apos;t it --
to learn how people really see you ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;ll find a way to wake her .
i &apos;m afraid time is a luxury you do not have .
the sands that allow passage to belle &apos;s dream
will not last forever .
if you do not wake belle within one hour ,
she will return to the red room of the sleeping curse --
a most horrid , fiery fate .
and this time , she will remain there forever .
so i would hurry up , if i were you --
if you love her .
of course i love her !
that &apos;s how i &apos;m gonna get her out of here .
i &apos;ll make her fall in love with me again .
look , i know my castle wasn &apos;t exactly cheery ,
but it was never like this .
to belle , it was .
this castle terrified her .
so in her dream , it &apos;s become a terrifying place .
it &apos;s also the place where we fell in love .
if i can just re @-@ create that moment --
it would just be some cruel trick .
are you willing to lie to her ?
it may be a trick ,
but my love for belle is true .
my love for her and my child will never be a lie .
rumplestiltskin , i @-@ i &apos;m so sorry .
i @-@ i &apos;ve almost got the tea ready .
it &apos;s all right .
see ?
it &apos;s not even chipped .
thank you .
i think you &apos;ve done enough for one day .
why don &apos;t you take a break ?
rumplestiltskin , what &apos;s going on ?
this , this isn &apos;t like you .
i have a ball to attend to later , and i &apos;m a bit rusty .
will you help me practice ?
i ... wasn &apos;t aware that i had any choices here .
you do .
you &apos;re doing wonderfully well .
there &apos;s just ... one more thing we need .
what --
what has come over you ?
maybe i &apos;m tired of being a beast .
one more dance ?
i heard we got hyde .
i thought it would take weeks and weeks of battles
and twists and turns , and ...
here you go doing it day 1 .
kudos to you , sis .
yeah . we got him .
what &apos;s wrong ?
this is the first time i &apos;ve been back here ...
... since robin died .
i need a moment .
what ?
this is just hard .
i know .
i lost someone here , too .
zelena ... i &apos;m sorry , but please go .
shouldn &apos;t we be helping each other ?
no .
why not ?
because ...
i blame you .
every time i look at you , i @-@ i blame you for what happened .
me ? ! what about emma ? !
she dragged you to hell !
i chose to go .
but you -- i trusted you .
and because of that , robin &apos;s soul was obliterated !
want to talk about trust ?
okay . let &apos;s talk about trust .
you made the biggest decision in your life ,
ripping out the evil part of you ,
and you just went to snow white
before coming to your own flesh and blood .
why do you even care ? !
you ripped out the part of yourself
that was most like me !
i don &apos;t know what you want me to say .
the baby and i will be out by tonight .
okay , keep looking .
that was emma and hook .
no sign of hyde or hyde &apos;s friends on the north side .
it &apos;s getting dark .
it &apos;s not going to get any easier .
wait , wait , wait .
amateurs .
they were in a hurry .
they &apos;re hiding because they &apos;re scared .
they don &apos;t know they can trust us .
hello ? !
my name is snow white . you can trust me .
hyde is locked up . he can &apos;t hurt you .
the people in our town want to help .
snow . look .
there &apos;s a place called granny &apos;s that &apos;ll give you food ,
people who can arrange for shelter .
let &apos;s go .
we &apos;ll be there whenever you &apos;re ready .
my parents -- they found some of hyde &apos;s people ,
sent them to granny &apos;s for food and shelter .
wonderful . i could use some food and shelter right about now .
you go ahead . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m gonna stay .
stay ? it &apos;s pitch @-@ black and it &apos;s freezing .
are you really that desperate to avoid talking to me ?
i &apos;m not avoiding talking to you .
i just -- i ... need to be alone .
emma ... look at your hand .
what the hell is going on with you ?
nothing .
you can lie to everyone else , but you can &apos;t lie to me .
it &apos;s fine .
i already asked you once to go .
right . fine .
no need to ask again .
i see you met my pet , emma .
who are you ?
how do you know my name ?
i know many things -- like why you &apos;re here .
the visions .
why the hell are they in my head ?
because these visions , emma , they tell a story .
the story of your future .
mom ?
why are you doing the locator spell ?
roland had a gift .
zelena lost it .
robin &apos;s feather .
you know better than anyone why it didn &apos;t work .
it &apos;s looking for him .
and he &apos;s gone .
&quot; obliterated . &quot;
that &apos;s how hades put it .
&quot; his soul destroyed . &quot;
that &apos;s what hades said ?
you don &apos;t believe him ?
villains say whatever they can to hurt people .
but what i choose to believe in is faith --
hope that when a hero &apos;s story is over ,
there &apos;s a special place for them .
this place is looking nicer .
what a shame . y @-@ you &apos;ve lived here alone for so long .
i haven &apos;t always been alone .
there was a son .
a son ?
what happened ?
he left .
he saw the darkness in my soul .
i had a chance to change for him ,
but ... i was too frightened to stop it .
if , uh ...
if you could change now ...
would you ?
for you ...
i would be the best man i can be .
wha--
we &apos;ve ... done this before .
yes !
no .
years of promises .
wait , wait ...
i @-@ i @-@ i can &apos;t do this again .
t @-@ this time is different . none of this is real .
this all happened a long time ago .
we fell in love . we got married .
and now , belle , you are with child .
the child was in danger ,
so you put yourself to sleep to keep it safe .
now that danger is gone , and i need you to wake up .
this ... is the truth .
but so is what i saw .
all those broken promises --
rumple ... i do love you ,
and i believe that you love me ,
but us being together -- it only causes heartbreak .
but the b-- the baby .
our child will be better off waiting with me
than being in debt to you .
i was really hoping that you &apos;d say that .
wait .
t @-@ there &apos;s still sand left . wait !
i &apos;m so sorry that i put you through all of this .
i just had to be sure
that you wouldn &apos;t fall for his lies again .
now i can wake you up .
&quot; wake me &quot; ?
but -- but how ?
with true love &apos;s kiss , of course .
but i don &apos;t love you .
i @-@ i don &apos;t even know you .
oh , you &apos;ve known me .
you &apos;ve known me since the day that i was conceived .
w @-@ wha-- what &apos;s going on ?
oh , i think you know ...
mother .
you &apos;re our son .
i will be .
when you sprinkled that sand onto belle ,
you sprinkled it onto me , too .
this isn &apos;t just belle &apos;s dreamworld .
it &apos;s mine .
and i &apos;m here to warn you --
do not let him destroy us ,
like he did his last family .
don &apos;t listen to him , belle . he can &apos;t be our son .
it &apos;s not possible .
oh , but it is .
and i &apos;ll prove it .
belle .
our son ... h @-@ he was testing me --
playing the part of morpheus to see if i &apos;d do right by him .
and like my other son ...
i &apos;ve lost him , too .
even before he &apos;s born .
if you ever let true love wake you up ,
then maybe you wouldn &apos;t keep losing .
we can discuss this at home .
oh , i &apos;ll go back ...
but , uh , i &apos;m not making a home with you .
our son gave me a warning , and i &apos;m going to listen to it .
you keep saying i &apos;m seeing the future ,
but it feels like a memory .
how do you know any of this ?
i was once called an oracle .
you &apos;d be wise to trust me .
what you saw was a tiny piece of future time .
yeah -- tiny . i need to see more .
knowing the future is a heavy burden .
the future &apos;s always in motion , always changing ,
but also inevitable .
the visions are coming whether i want them to or not .
let &apos;s get this done .
look .
i &apos;m not gonna let you hurt them .
what you saw
was a small piece of the end of your story , savior .
there has to be another way .
you can change the path to the destination ,
but the destination is the same .
on the day you saw , in the battle you saw ...
you will die .
i see you found my friend . was she helpful ?
you knew exactly what the oracle was gonna show me ,
so cut the crap .
what &apos;s coming , and how do i stop it ?
why would i want it to ?
whatever &apos;s coming , whether you help me or not ,
i will defeat it .
that &apos;s funny .
that &apos;s what the saviors always say .
what are you talking about ?
that &apos;s right , emma .
you &apos;re not the first savior i &apos;ve encountered .
wherever there &apos;s a savior ,
there &apos;s a villain who brings them down .
that &apos;s how the savior &apos;s story always goes .
so , who is it ?
i don &apos;t know who your villain is .
maybe they &apos;re already here .
or maybe they came with me .
i expect you &apos;ll want to help them , as saviors do ,
but you have to ask yourself --
is helping them exactly what causes your story to end ?
thought you needed to be alone .
changed my mind .
can i have one of those ?
thanks .
you &apos;re in a better mood .
you were right . i just needed to get help .
i went back to archie and figured everything out .
and your hand ?
it &apos;s was just stress .
you sure that &apos;s what it was -- stress ?
promise .
i &apos;m so sorry , regina .
i know it &apos;ll work out , though .
emma and i had lots of ups and downs
before we learned to really be honest with each other .
actually , i don &apos;t think honesty &apos;s our problem .
well , so what do you think it is ?
robin .
i was an awful stepmother .
regina , come on . that was the past .
i know i was .
how did you maintain hope during those terrible times ?
well , when my mother died ...
... then my father ...
i mean , i had nothing .
and then i realized , while y--
well , the evil queen was trying to kill me ...
... that the only way i could stay alive
was to never give up .
you taught me how to have faith .
you were the one who taught me that hope is a choice .
i think hades was wrong .
robin is at peace .
you know , i &apos;ve been sitting here
thinking about these new people
and how pathetic they were for hiding in some horrible land
so their stories didn &apos;t have to play out .
and then i realized ...
that &apos;s exactly what i used to do .
i don &apos;t remember you hiding from anything .
oh , i did .
my life just stopped .
the only story i heard was the one i kept telling myself --
that i was ... the evil queen .
until finally , i forgot the most important thing .
my life was never just one story .
it was many stories .
to some , a villain .
i hurt people ...
... in ways i can never make up for .
to others , i &apos;m ...
a hero .
they &apos;ve seen my strength ,
my ability to do the hard things ,
even when i thought i couldn &apos;t .
i want to start a new story .
one where the evil queen doesn &apos;t get a part .
and i choose to believe that this story ...
will have a better ending than my last .
there you are .
regina ?
isn &apos;t life deliciously ironic ?
all you ever wanted was a sister .
and when you finally get that wish ...
... it &apos;s the wrong one .
you ...
you &apos;re alive .
you can &apos;t get rid of me that easily .
what do you want ?
oh , let &apos;s have a drink , sis .
it &apos;s time for some sisterly bonding .
