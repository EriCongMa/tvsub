i need to see some kind of complete draft
and i need to see it soon .
oh , you &apos;ll have it .
good .
if somebody said that you could start
your own business , what would you do ?
don &apos;t kid like that , lucas .
who &apos;s kidding ?
is that who i think it is ?
sara harvey &apos;s helping hand .
sara &apos;s back at the radley .
she checked in under a fake name
and she &apos;s still looking for something .
these are plans for the radley
same ones sara got from the records office .
alison &apos;s in the hospital .
what happened ?
she had an accident or what looked like an accident .
it &apos;s happening again , and we &apos;re gonna do something about it .
we &apos;re building a rat trap .
and you &apos;re the cheese .
are you sure you wanna do this ?
i wouldn &apos;t have thought of it if i wasn &apos;t ready to do it .
nobody here is gonna let you do this by yourself .
leave my friends alone .
i killed charlotte .
okay , thanks for ..
anything ?
get some rest .
i &apos;ll call you later . bye .
that was alison . she &apos;s headed home tomorrow .
but elliot &apos;s going to a conference in chicago .
she shouldn &apos;t be alone .
none of you should till this is over .
guys , she &apos;s typing .
if you &apos;re lying , i shoot all of you .
hanna , are you sure that you wanna do this ?
first , it was aria , then ali .
whoever &apos;s next could end up lying in a casket
instead of a hospital bed .
and we all decided this is the right thing to do .
okay , but we can undecide . it &apos;s not too late .
yeah , well , i trust caleb .
i do , too .
she &apos;s sending another text .
no police .
as predicted .
another text .
this is between you and me .
sara harvey took the bait .
汉娜
it &apos;ll be your last .
are you sure you wanna rest on the couch ?
i already feel like an invalid .
please don &apos;t make me crawl into another bed .
you &apos;re far from an invalid .
even your doctor said , you showed tremendous strength .
you and charlotte both have that in common .
i miss her every day .
i still feel responsible .
elliot , you &apos;re not .
you gave me back my sister as a , a healthy , hopeful person .
jason and i only had a few years with her
but we wouldn &apos;t have that without you .
your brother filled me in on everything
he &apos;s doing at carissimi .
i think it &apos;s a brilliant tribute to charlotte .
she &apos;d be ...
so proud to know all that money &apos;s
being used to help people .
now , no one can take that away from us , from her .
forget it . i &apos;m not going to the conference .
elliot , i love you , but i know you &apos;re stalling .
you should go before you miss your plan .
i love you , too .
夏洛蒂
here is sara &apos;s old room .
and this is where her secret exit door was .
when did you ..
no , i , i fought it as long as i could .
but i had to admit defeat .
when yvonne and i were in paris , and i @-@ i thought i was pointing
to an eclair on the menu .
then , the waiter brought out a bucket of snails .
yeah , but who wants to eat snails for breakfast ?
you remember french ?
hmm . now , i look like a guy who needs glasses .
now , why do you wanna get back down here ?
uh , because sara just checked back into the hotel .
and she specifically asked for a room on the first floor .
directly above the old radley basement .
so we think that she must be looking for something .
and whatever that thing is
maybe we can use it to prove that she &apos;s our new big @-@ bad .
so , if i make sure that she &apos;s locked out
when hanna &apos;s waiting for her ..
... it &apos;ll be safe to go down there and find it .
有房
hey !
hey .
where &apos;s hanna ?
oh , she &apos;s at the radley .
she went to make it look like she was saying her
last goodbye to her mom .
oh ! i left the generator in the van .
yeah , &apos; cause nothing spells a trap
like one of us buying a machine that could deliver 9500 watts .
well , i drove to ardmore to get it and no one followed me .
how do you know how to build an electric fence ?
i googled &quot; how to build an electric fence ? &quot;
if this whole thing works , it &apos;s not gonna kill her , right ?
it will work .
and no , it &apos;ll just knock her on her ass
and she &apos;ll stay there until one of us picks her up .
i know i shouldn &apos;t be saying this , but this whole thing
just kind of reeks of irony .
you should totally say it .
if we &apos;re right about sara ,
she deserves more than a few volts .
sara &apos;s working off grid .
here .
thanks .
um , but i think ,
she missed something in the east wing .
there &apos;s a records room in the old radley basement .
um , but on this current blueprint
there &apos;s no visible door to access it .
so , somebody turned it into a secret room ?
somebody , who spent a lot of time at radley .
charlotte .
i &apos;ll seal sara &apos;s secret exit door first .
that way , when we &apos;re down there
she won &apos;t be able to get back in .
we ?
yeah , i &apos;m not gonna let you do this alone .
toby , this is tomorrow night .
i was thinking that you could just do the prep work today .
and then , i can sneak down there during my mom &apos;s party .
i can &apos;t drag my power tools into a hotel
and then cut through walls without making a lot of noise .
whether your mom wins or loses ,
radley will be a scene tomorrow .
that will be our cover .
i , i just don &apos;t wanna mess things up for you and yvonne .
i don &apos;t either , but if you wanna find out
what &apos;s in this room , we &apos;re gonna do this together .
ezra ?
you okay ?
were you working on the last chapter ?
it &apos;s finished .
do you want me to read it ?
i &apos;m never gonna see her again .
i haven &apos;t said that out loud .
i couldn &apos;t , i couldn &apos;t let myself believe
that she was ... r @-@ really gone .
god , ezra , i am so sorry .
but you &apos;ve written a really beautiful
love story for nicole .
i can finally hear her name now , without wanting to
put my fists through a wall .
i &apos;m sorry .
thank you .
for pushing me to finish .
you did the heavy lifting .
no , aria , i was ...
down for the count when you came back .
so i &apos;d say that we did that together .
if the examination didn &apos;t show anything then
why did brother man bring his whole
springman tribe down here in this sticky heat .
and why so many illusions to you and rainbow hill ?
you know what rainbow hill is ?
it &apos;s a place that &apos;s famous for
treating famous alcoholics and dope fiends .
i &apos;m not famous , maggie .
no , and you don &apos;t take dope .
otherwise you &apos;d be a perfect candidate for rainbow hill .
that &apos;s where brother man &apos;s going to tell big daddy ..
hello .
is someone there ?
did you miss me ?
and i had an amazing dream about her in the hospital .
she wanted me to know she was proud of me .
i had a dream like that ..
after my dad &apos;s funeral .
i fell asleep on the couch and he woke me up .
he was wearing his dress blues and he looked so handsome .
he came to say goodbye .
you think it was really him ?
i &apos;d like to think so .
but maybe it felt so real because i wanted it to be .
i didn &apos;t wanna see my mom the way she looked today .
ali , those painkillers are really strong .
they can mess with your head .
yeah , when they list the side effects
they should say , it may cause crazy visions .
i &apos;d like to see that commercial .
may cause drowsiness , loss of appetite .
crazy visions , and in some cases
your dead mother might even call you on the telephone .
well , i hate that you have to babysit me .
but i &apos;m really happy that you &apos;re here .
me , too .
are you okay with transport duty tomorrow ?
um , senior turnout &apos;s gonna be really key for us .
you know , your mom treats me like part of the family .
so , i &apos;m all @-@ in for whatever she needs .
toby , we feel like you are part of our family .
yvonne , so after the polls close tomorrow ,
there &apos;s something that i have to take care of .
so , i won &apos;t be able to make it to this party .
i don &apos;t understand .
it &apos;s a favor for a friend .
so it &apos;s not something , you &apos;re taking care of , it &apos;s someone .
would her name be spencer ?
we haven &apos;t received all the numbers yet .
but it seems like it &apos;s gonna be a pretty close race .
spencer , hi .
you must be , because i can &apos;t think of any other reason
you &apos;d be crazy enough to show up here .
really , spencer , from one ex @-@ radley patient to another ,
i think , you &apos;d be a little more sensitive to that word .
what do you want , mona ?
to help .
help whom ?
your mother .
she &apos;s the candidate . i &apos;m voting for and i want her to win .
is it that you want my mother to win
or you want phillips to lose ?
look , spencer , i &apos;m not the enemy .
i haven &apos;t been for a long time .
just ... stick to the script .
yes , ma &apos;am .
good evening . hi , do you have a moment to chat ?
because veronica hastings is running for election
to help people just like you .
it &apos;s complicated , but i &apos;m the only person that can do this .
and you can &apos;t tell me what it is that spencer needs ?
i don &apos;t wanna lie to you , yvonne
so please don &apos;t ask me again .
do you hear how that sounds ?
a month ago , we were having conversations
about building a future together .
and now you can &apos;t even answer a simple question .
i know , i &apos;m sorry .
i have to get back to work .
y @-@ yvonne , wait , i--
i won &apos;t let you turn me into the woman who says
&quot; pick me , not her . &quot;
the fence runs along the backside .
and we will have a visual of the front .
we &apos;re ready for them , hanna .
hey , will you hand me the phillips ?
it &apos;s the one with the--
with the star tip , i know .
thank you .
so , did you make a decision yet ?
what do you mean ?
about lucas &apos; offer .
oh , right .
um , yeah , i mean , there &apos;s still a lot to think about .
it &apos;s not all about me .
hey , if this fence is always electric ,
what are the motion sensors for ?
uh , they &apos;ll trigger the lights and the camera .
that way if a @-@ moji realizes this is a set @-@ up
in worst case scenario , we &apos;ll get a picture of her .
what &apos;s so funny ? do i have a plumber &apos;s crack or something ?
no , your crack is covered .
it &apos;s just we didn &apos;t know what to call this sicko .
and i think that you just named it .
i &apos;m just babysitting alison with emily .
but if you need anything .
hey , han .
thank you for doing this .
you &apos;re a lot braver than i am .
i love you , too .
aria , this book is incredible .
why are you so nervous ? liam &apos;s gonna love it .
i &apos;m not nervous about ezra &apos;s chapters .
they &apos;re filled with nothing but the truth .
are you afraid yours aren &apos;t as honest ?
actually , i think they &apos;re a little too honest .
are we having two different conversations here ?
because that would be a good thing , right ?
i was supposed to write from nicole &apos;s side
of her love story with ezra .
so at first , i was just pulling from my feelings for liam .
but those weren &apos;t the right fit .
so , i just started remembering all the things .
i used to love about ezra .
yeah , but if you &apos;re writing about
what you used to feel about ezra--
and i convinced myself that that was true .
but liam thinks that i &apos;m still writing from the heart .
so it hurts him to read those pages .
how did this get so complicated ?
you &apos;re writing a book with the guy you used to be in love with .
and it &apos;s about his relationship with his dead girlfriend .
you thought that was gonna be simple ?
elliot ?
ali ?
oh , my god . ali .
ali , what is it ?
he was just here .
ali , there &apos;s nobody in the house but us .
hey , it &apos;s just another bad dream .
he touched me . i felt it .
no , ali . who are you talking about ?
wilden .
i &apos;m gonna call elliot .
what &apos;s wrong with me ?
how are you gonna know that sara &apos;s not following you ?
i programed a drone to fly over my car .
and i attached a camera to it
so we &apos;ll see if anybody &apos;s behind us .
more coffee ?
always .
can you even wear underwear with a dress that tight ?
do you disapprove ?
no . no , not at all .
but i know that you &apos;re gonna be climbing down a rope ladder
with toby tonight ,
and i &apos;m assuming that he &apos;s gonna be going first .
that &apos;s why i gave him a bag of clothes yesterday .
they &apos;re gonna be waiting for me in sara &apos;s old room .
hmm . gotcha .
i &apos;m glad that you care enough to be concerned about my panties .
hmm . well , i &apos;m concerned about a lot more than your panties .
spence , need to talk you .
um , okay , dad . i &apos;ll be up at the house in five .
oh , come on , it &apos;s a scene in there .
could use a moment alone with my daughter .
okay , well , i &apos;m not dressed .
alright , whatever you do , just be safe , okay ?
okay .
stay in touch with me .
yeah .
caleb .
yeah ?
i love you .
go . i &apos;ll call you later .
okay .
i can &apos;t believe emily left you alone .
she won &apos;t be long , she just went to vote .
if you have another dream , just tell yourself
it &apos;s your mind playing tricks on you .
alison , this is all about misplaced guilt .
elliot , i &apos;m not going to sleep until you get home so ...
you don &apos;t need to worry about me .
i &apos;ll call you on my way to the airport .
see you tonight .
bye , love .
you &apos;re not real .
none of this is real .
please go away .
i &apos;m begging you .
it wasn &apos;t my fault !
sir , if you can please just give her another call
and just get back to me , that , uh , that &apos;d be great .
thank you .

yvonne , i &apos;m going to make this up to you . i promise .
i love you .
oh , thank you , pretty eyes .
knock knock .
ezra ?
oh , yes , actually jillian , aria just walked in .
um , would you like to chat with her too ?
oh , no , that &apos;s fine . i totally understand .
yes , i will pass along the message . okay .
that is so jillian .
i know that she can &apos;t tell anyone bad news to their face .
which means she loved your chapters and she hated mine .
of course .
i @-@ i should &apos;ve known she would never give me a fair shot .
no , aria , she just stepped into a meeting .
do you know how many times i &apos;ve told that exact lie for her ?
aria , she loved the entire book .
no , seriously , who died
and appointed her the expert on literature ?
let &apos;s remember this is the same woman who published
&quot; this snail &apos;s life . &quot;
it &apos;s like the worst book ..
what did you say ?
she loved my chapters and yours .
uh , jillian actually said , love not like .
&apos;cause she never uses , love she thinks
that &apos;s a highly overused word .
jillian &apos;s pushing up the release date to christmas .
she &apos;s talking a @-@ a book tour , tv rights , a prequel .
you &apos;re being 100 % serious right now ?
aria , they &apos;re gonna market the hell out of this book .
it &apos;s gonna be huge .
oh , my god , we did it .
ezra , we really did it .
yeah , we did .
it looks like creepy harold
just walked away and never looked back .
kinda reminds me of a hostel i stayed at in budapest .
i felt like one of miss peregrine &apos;s peculiar children .
look , i &apos;ll only miss prague .
i &apos;ll fly straight from tokyo to budapest .
you said that you wanted to talk about this
you already made up your mind .
if i don &apos;t go , i &apos;ll lose my job .
do you know how many times i &apos;ve heard that ?
you said that on my birthday .
on your birthday , on new year &apos;s eve .
hanna , your life is on a loop ,
i &apos;m barely a part of it .
what do you want me to do ?
i want you to say no to your boss and come with me to europe
like we &apos;ve been planning for the last three months .
i can &apos;t do that .
alright , i &apos;m sorry .
if you go , i &apos;m not gonna be here
when you get back .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;m leaving today .
i can &apos;t keep doing this .
we &apos;ll work this out .
like we always do .
i &apos;ll call you from the cab .
you okay ?
yeah . yeah , i &apos;m fine .
hanna , you &apos;re gonna be safe in here . i promise .
ali ?

melissa , it &apos;s still the sa ..
i will let you know .
i will let her know , okay . bye .
that was melissa , she &apos;s sending her love
for the tenth time this hour .
i swear she &apos;s more nervous than i am .
there you go .
i would just like to say , win or lose
you ran a smart , passionate campaign .
and i couldn &apos;t be prouder of you .
or you , spence , you really
you stepped up when mom needed you .
it &apos;s been a rough week for all of us .
i know we &apos;ve all made sacrifices
and i appreciate how hard you &apos;ve worked
you &apos;ve both worked to get us here .
thank you .
cheers .
cheers .
oh . i &apos;ll be right back .
hey , did you find alison ?
no . and i searched your entire neighborhood .
spence , can you help me look for her ?
emily , toby &apos;s already upstairs in the hotel room .
hanna and caleb are at the lost woods .
i mean , the plan is in motion , i can &apos;t leave .
i know , i have a bad feeling about this .
she &apos;s scared and she thinks that
she &apos;s seeing dead people , so ..
where would you go if you wanted to feel safe ?
do you need anything ?
a whisky and diet would be nice .
i brought some water .
okay , i &apos;m gonna run a test on the strobe lights .
aria , could you give me a hand ?
yeah , sure .
you &apos;re really brave , you know that ?
someone had to be the bait .
didn &apos;t have to be you .
well , you said i had nothing to worry about .
you don &apos;t .
there &apos;s no way sara harvey is gonna get in here .
are you sure ?
have i ever let you down before ?
no .
but , i &apos;ve let you down .
what do you mean ?
the night of our big fight .
the night we broke up .
you made a difficult choice .
there &apos;s something that you don &apos;t know .
you &apos;ve reached caleb . leave a message .
i have to get out of here .
caleb ?
i am so sorry . i don &apos;t know what i was thinking .
来电
if i had just come back a few minutes earlier ..
or never left ..
things might be so different now .
yeah . they might be .
i never stopped loving you .
that &apos;s it . i think we &apos;re ready .
okay .
one , two , three , four
five , six , seven , eight .
the door it &apos;s right behind here .
i can hammer through the drywall
but i &apos;m gonna need to saw through the plywood .
i can do it .
you remember how to use a power saw ?
i had a good teacher .
hanna , are you sure you wanna do this ?
yeah , i am .
okay , no one followed you guys here .
we &apos;re good to go .
are you ready ?
it &apos;s done .
ali .
i &apos;ve been looking everywhere for you .
i knew they wouldn &apos;t follow me here .
i deserve it . this is my punishment .
ali , your mom and wilden are dead .
they came back for me .
and they &apos;re gonna take me straight to hell .
we can &apos;t stay here , okay ?
yes , i can .
listen to me . this is like elliott said .
this is all in your head . remember ?
these are hallucinations .
i can &apos;t tell what &apos;s real anymore .
emily , i need help .
toby ?
oh , my god . you brought your gun ?
get behind me .
i &apos;m a police officer . stop right there .
mona . are you still stalking us ?
what are you looking for ?
we don &apos;t know yet , we &apos;re about to find out .
there &apos;s nothing here .
yes , there is .
mary drake .
she was a patient here 25 years ago .
oh , my god , she had a child while she was here .
named charles .
he was adopted by jessica and kenneth dilaurentis .
wait , you guys .
charlotte wasn &apos;t jason &apos;s older sister .
they were practically the same age .
why lie about that ?
maybe kenneth and jessica didn &apos;t want anyone
to know that charlotte was adopted .
why would charlotte go through so much trouble
just to hide this file ?
maybe charlotte didn &apos;t hide it .
maybe her mother did . her birth mother .
mary drake .
someone &apos;s approaching .
just west of the perimeter .
let &apos;s go .
come on .
just be careful .
this way , this way .
hurry , quick . come on . come on .
lookout .
over here .
do you see her ?
there &apos;s nobody here .
you said she would be knocked on her ass .
we gotta get back to hanna .
hanna !
hanna , are you in there ?
hanna , say something .
hanna , come on .
han !
hanna !
han .
there &apos;s no way out of here .
this is impossible .
you &apos;ll need to remove all your personal effects .
can you give these to elliott , please ?
yeah , of course .
this form advises that although you are voluntarily
admitting yourself for treatment
you are not necessarily free to leave psychiatric care .
you may be involuntarily detained
if the doctor deems it necessary .
do you understand , mrs. rollins ?
yes .
can we just have a moment , please ?
sure .
ali , do you really wanna do this ?
i mean , elliott &apos;s on his way home
maybe you should just wait and talk to him .
i &apos;m only sure of one thing right now
and that &apos;s that i need help .
i know , but ... they put charlotte here .
and she got better .
thank you for taking care of me .
if you need anything ..
love you .
love you , too .
we &apos;ll show you to your room now .
may i have your attention , please ?
quiet down , everyone .
i would like to introduce you
to your new state senator
veronica hastings .
thank you everyone for all of your hard work .
we did it !
hey , congratulations .
thanks .
i @-@ i really cannot thank you enough
for all of the help that you gave me tonight .
hey , aria .
spence , what &apos;s going on ?
i should have checked the floors .
caleb , who would have thought to do that ?
a !
oh , my god . i &apos;m so sorry .
why the hell did you bring her here ?
no , no , we didn &apos;t .
i followed them .
guys , video &apos;s downloading .
wait . r @-@ rewind it .
look , stop !
but could that even be possible ?
i just got a call from the hospital .
alison &apos;s resting comfortably .
she signed the papers ?
yes , mary .
i control 51 % of carissimi now .
you are the only man my daughter ever loved .
i would have done anything for charlotte .
elliott , you proved that when you married her cousin .
we &apos;ve finally taken back what was supposed to be mine .
and that &apos;s what our charlotte would have wanted .
guys , it is mrs. d !
toby , should we call the police ?
&quot; thanks for giving me hanna . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re free to go . &quot;
