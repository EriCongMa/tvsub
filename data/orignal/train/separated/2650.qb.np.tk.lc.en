guard elizabeth , and when the time comes ,
make sure karakurt reaches the f.b.i. safely .
where &apos;s reven wright ?
last time we talked ,
she mentioned a tommy markin .
laurel hitchin is in the cabal .
why would venezuela agree to such a ridiculous proposal ?
the ability to print as much money as he &apos;d like to print .
elizabeth keen , i &apos;m here to escort you downtown ,
where you &apos;ll be held safely pending your arraignment .
gather your team .
it &apos;s time to take down the cabal .
you &apos;re late .
um , be careful with that . i &apos;m not due for an upgrade --

hello , harold .
you look pretty well , considering .
thank you all for coming .
i apologize for the security protocols ,
but my better half insists .
just the fact that you are all here
is a testament to the deep concern we share
for elizabeth keen &apos;s safety and well @-@ being .
the threat from forces within is proving to be more powerful
and far @-@ reaching than one could ever have imagined .
i &apos;ve asked you here
because we have one chance to save elizabeth .
but to do that , we must work together .
so ...
oh , my god ,
this is why i &apos;m a terrible bridge player .
with anyone else ,
steve lyditt would have won the north american pairs .
we didn &apos;t even make it through regionals .
i abhor working with a partner .
sharing my hand with anyone goes against every instinct i have .
but such is life . here we are .
so , five weeks ago ,
i called the metro p.d. to report
a sighting of raymond reddington at the del rio diner .
i created a hostage crisis so you would be so kind
as to release my attorney , marvin gerard , from prison .
that day , marvin and i conceived a plan
to exonerate elizabeth keen by targeting the cabal ,
and , in particular , the director .
since that day , everything we &apos;ve done
has been in service of that plan .
the verdiant case
has resulted in catastrophic damage to the cabal &apos;s finances .
the client list we took from the djinn
gave us leverage with key players in the cabal
to further isolate and weaken the director &apos;s influence .
with andras halmi , or ... part of him ,
we cut a gaping hole
in the director &apos;s golden parachute ...
leaving him nothing to run with
and causing even further distrust
and divisions within the cabal .
but the zal bin hasaan has opened a window of opportunity
we must slip through with great haste .
to save elizabeth ,
we must execute a specific attack ,
one so impactful ,
it will force the cabal to completely abandon the director
and publicly exonerate elizabeth keen .
what the hell do you have in mind ?
see , this is why i don &apos;t play well with partners .
don &apos;t fret , harold . i &apos;m holding all the trumps .
i &apos;ll be the declarer , you be the dummy ,
and we &apos;ll win the hand .
anything else ?
good .
let &apos;s begin .
第三季第十集
and we are over the convoy now ,
as f.b.i. vehicles speed agent keen
to the federal courthouse .
sources say she &apos;ll appear before a judge authorized to preside
over matters of top national security .
the name of that judge has not been released .
there is no record of the case on any official court document .
local p.d. in west virginia must &apos;ve leaked the arrest .
i &apos;m counting four choppers .
we &apos;re getting word of a crowd assembling at the courthouse , sir .
might get a little messy .
they were gonna kill me .
the director wasn &apos;t taking me to any black site for questioning
about actionable intel .
if you hadn &apos;t shown up when you did , i &apos;d be dead .
i &apos;m sorry , keen .
i expected the director to try something ,
but i also expected reven wright to be there to intervene .
what happened ?
i think laurel hitchin killed her ...
or had her killed .
my god . they &apos;re in the white house .
hey , look , reven may be gone ,
but the safeguards we put in place
for your arrest are still intact .
she arranged for your case to be heard by a judge
she trusted completely .
as much as she trusted laurel hitchin ?
pending trial ,
you &apos;ll be housed under military guard at fort meade .
we can keep you safe there , liz .
i wouldn &apos;t have brought you in if i didn &apos;t believe that .
i need a pen and paper .
against protocol , ma &apos;am .
i don &apos;t have a will .
give her the damn pen and paper .
who do you want me to give this to ?
tell you what .
i &apos;ll hold on to it .
give it back to you when this is all over , okay ?
you ready ?
no .
she &apos;s already dead .
the only way she gets out of that building
is if they carry her out .
no .
place is a fortress --
metal detectors , cameras , u.s. marshals .
it &apos;s not gonna be easy to get to her .
it wasn &apos;t easy to kill the orea agents or the senator .
it doesn &apos;t have to be easy to get done .
which is exactly what you &apos;re gonna tell the u.s. attorney .
save her life , maybe yours in the process .
your whole plan , freeing the girl ,
it all depends on me .
me talking , telling the truth --
which , if i do , is a death sentence .
makes me think i &apos;m not getting enough out of the deal .
you agreed to talk .
maybe i got cold feet .
cold feet .
take a look .
the woman i love is in there because of you .
so let &apos;s be clear . if you talk ,
there is a chance they will kill you .
but if you don &apos;t talk ,
i will definitely kill you very slowly .
you should also know that i know where your sister is .
up in that hole where i found you .
i &apos;ve killed a lot of people to get this done .
don &apos;t think i won &apos;t do it again .
when i get the call , i &apos;m walking you into that federal building
and you ... will ... talk .
that &apos;s it ? that &apos;s your plan ?
you want to abduct the director of clandestine services ?
yes .
okay , i , uh , really , really do not like that guy ,
and i @-@ i want to be a @-@ a team player and all ,
but this sounds a little like --
treason ? that &apos;s because it is .
not to mention seditious conspiracy and felony kidnapping .
for which you could all spend the rest of your lives in prison .
what are you going to do ? ransom him back to the cabal ?
they won &apos;t exonerate keen to get him back .
agreed . that &apos;s why i have something in mind
that &apos;s infinitely more persuasive than ransom .
we &apos;ve been monitoring the man around the clock .
he and his wife are in marital therapy .
i &apos;m actually a great proponent of marital therapy .
worked for me .
then again , i had sort of a ... thing for the therapist .
lovely voice .
you were in therapy ?
the director &apos;s wife is a pill popper --
downers mainly , to deal with panic attacks and anxiety .
they see a psychiatrist every wednesday morning ,
doctor oren huffnagel .
his wife meets him at the middleton building .
a real creature of habit .
she gets a latte every day at the same shop ,
and then , on wednesdays , she walks over for the appointment .
the director takes a scaled @-@ down security team -- two agents ,
one of whom stays in the lobby .
sounds great , except tomorrow &apos;s not wednesday .
yes , which is why we &apos;ll need a ruse
that prompts the director to go see the good doctor tomorrow .
and what do we do with him once we have him ?
your arraignment &apos;s tomorrow morning .
we got authorization to keep you here overnight .
hey , don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
cooper reached out to allison gaines .
the criminal defense attorney ?
one of the best in the country . she &apos;ll be here in the morning .
one more thing ...
yeah , it &apos;s me .
are you all right ?
i &apos;m here .
lizzy , you will make it through this .
everything happens tomorrow .
agent ressler won &apos;t let you out of his sight .
thank you .
i want her taken out tonight .
calm down , peter .
the problem of elizabeth keen
will be resolved by this time tomorrow .
listen , we could have her commit suicide in her cell .
agent ressler &apos;s with her now ,
and he won &apos;t leave her tonight .
we &apos;ll finish this tomorrow .
how ?
we &apos;ve been developing some new assets at the courthouse .
i &apos;ve got someone in mind .
who ?
agent keen will never make it to fort meade .
i promise you that .
you promise me that ? you do ?
we &apos;re done , peter .
you look tired .
there &apos;ll be plenty of time to sleep when this is over --
for both of us .
when &apos;s the lawyer coming ?
courthouse opens in half an hour .
thank you .
♬ hey ♬
♬ got to , got to payback ♬
♬ payback ♬
♬ revenge ♬
♬ payback ♬
♬ revenge ♬
♬ i &apos;m mad ♬
♬ payback is a thing you got to see ♬
♬ hell ♬
wait . uh , wait , we must be on the wrong floor .
i thought you said this is where the director
and his wife get therapy .
it will be .
the routine is always the same .
the unhappy couple arrive separately
and are escorted into the lobby by two agents .
one agent remains downstairs watching the entrance ,
the other escorts them onto an elevator
to ensure they ride alone in their misery .
dr. huffnagel is on the sixth floor ,
suite 612 , catty @-@ corner to the elevators .
yeah , i still don &apos;t get it .
if his office is on the sixth floor ,
why are we on the eighth ?
the layout of every floor in the building is identical .
all we need to do is recreate the sixth floor on the eighth .
♬ carry on ♬
♬ carry on ♬
whoa , indeed .
i need you to access the elevator system
to make sure that when that agent presses 6,
the elevator takes them to 8 , where we &apos;ll be waiting .
oh , that is so cool . sleight of hand .
i love magic .
♬ let me hit him , hit him , hit him ♬
but , uh , the real trick is going to be getting the director here
in the first place .
harold cooper and agent navabi
are working on that as we speak .
oh , my god .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s all right . i &apos;m fine .
oh -- no , it &apos;s my fault . let me get you another one .
no , really . it &apos;s all right .
please , i insist .
all right , thank you .
hi . i just bumped into this nice lady
and her coffee .
i &apos;d like to buy her another one .
it was a latte .
here you go . again , i am so sorry .
it &apos;s okay . thank you .
the figurine on the sixth floor ,
the one under that mirror that &apos;s opposite the elevators .
we couldn &apos;t find a duplicate .
i can try to find something similar , but --
good night . it &apos;s not the hope diamond .
steal the damn thing .
and while i &apos;m at it , shall i smile for the security cameras ?
apples .
get a bowl . something glass , crystal .
what if he notices ? dearie , this could blow the whole thing .
he won &apos;t .
she said , what if he does ?
i know what she said , marvin . why are you still here ?
everybody likes apples .
are you all right , ma &apos;am ?
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening .
i -- i &apos;m dizzy .
hang on . i got you .
we &apos;re gonna go right here .
thank you , i -- i &apos;m --
i can call 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
no , my -- my heart , it &apos;s racing .
i can &apos;t get my breath .
i &apos;m calling an ambulance .
no , no , i @-@ i get panic attacks .
i -- i ...
oh , my god .
i &apos;m ...
you &apos;re okay .
my -- my doctor .
huffnagel . it &apos;s in my contacts .
if you could -- please ...
yes , hello . is dr. huffnagel in ?
yes , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m here with , uh ...
lynda . lynda kotsiopulos .
lynda kotsiopulos . she &apos;s , uh , dizzy .
seems to be a panic attack of some sort .
yes , she &apos;s right here .
lynda ? is everything all right ?
i think something &apos;s wrong .
i think i &apos;m having another episode .
have you taken your medication ? - yes , yes . peter --
you have to call peter .
listen , you just -- you have to get ahold --
i &apos;m calling peter right now . you &apos;re gonna be fine .
okay .
could you help me get a cab , please ?
of course .
thank you .
elizabeth keen . allison gaines .
marshals will clear the floor and give you two some privacy .
harold cooper warned me .
he said you wouldn &apos;t look like much .
what does that mean ?
it means my business is monsters , agent keen .
and i &apos;ve met a lot of them .
all charged with a lot less than you are , sweetie .
you don &apos;t look like a monster .
is this how you start all your client consultations ?
i &apos;ve read the complaint .
the u.s. government is formally charging you
with 16 counts of capital murder .
16 ?
14 c.i.a. agents killed in the orea bombing ,
the senator you infected -- hawkins -- and , oh , yes ,
the attorney general of the united states .
there are other charges --
the off @-@ duty cop you shot on the run .
i &apos;m innocent . i &apos;m being framed .
so the two witnesses
who saw you execute tom connolly were mistaken ?
listen to me . i won &apos;t lie to you .
i &apos;ve been on this case 24 hours ,
and what i see looks bad .
they &apos;re gonna kill me . today .
mr. iverson , thank you for coming .
so , you &apos;re aware of what we &apos;re asking ?
and you think you can get it done ?
it won &apos;t happen in the pens .
i work courthouse security , but not in that area ,
and you can &apos;t have weapons around the cells .
i can do it when they move her .
as long as it gets done .
this is assistant u.s. attorney andrew barrett .
when you &apos;re arrested , your case will go to him for prosecution .
i assume you recognize judge sanborn ?
they can steer the case to me .
i &apos;ll order a psychiatric exam ,
which will be done by one of our people .
with mr. barrett &apos;s consent , you &apos;ll be declared not guilty
by reason of insanity or mental defect .
you &apos;ll spend a couple of years
at a psychiatric facility of our choosing ,
then be released .
you &apos;ll be a free man
with some very powerful and grateful friends .
if i don &apos;t make it , i want the money to go to my kids ,
not my ex @-@ wife .
just get the job done .
oyez oyez . all rise .
this court is now in session .
the honorable judge harrison trotter presiding .
calling united states vs. elizabeth keen .
good morning , your honor .
allison gaines for the defendant .
assistant u.s. attorney douglas young for the government .
as you know , your honor ,
this matter has national security implications .
you &apos;ve seen the complaint .
so have i , your honor .
and in the interest of time , we waive any formal reading
of the rights and charges .
denied .
excuse me ?
that may be the ordinary course of business ,
but there is nothing ordinary about the charges
against your client .
ms. keen , the united states government has charged you
with 16 counts of capital murder .
each one exposes you to a death sentence .
do you understand that ?
yes .
that &apos;s aside from the treason and espionage charges ,
which are also capital offenses .
mr. young , please read the names of the victims .
from the office of russian and european analysis --
case officer daniel allen ,
case officer joanne dobbs ,
case officer rebecca haft ,
case officer marshall masik .
i can only hope you smuggled me in here for an exclusive .
i need a favor .
i &apos;m a reporter . i don &apos;t do favors .
there &apos;s gonna be a new development in the keen case .
what development ?
it &apos;s gonna break , and when it does ,
i need you and your friends to be there .
so much for the exclusive .
fine . but i get something in return .
your story .
the story of the f.b.i. agent who hunted down his own partner .
over dinner .
and a really expensive bottle of wine .
you and your pals show up , i &apos;ll take you to teroni &apos;s .
i &apos;ll call you when we &apos;re ready .
she &apos;s in with the judge now . you ready ?
waiting on you .
get karakurt in position .
as soon as i hear from reddington , we go .
you &apos;re on .
it &apos;s your moment of truth .
he looks worried .
almost as if he got a call from his wife &apos;s shrink
telling him she &apos;s having a panic attack .
he &apos;s on his way to you now .
aram , he &apos;s getting on elevator 22 .
okay .
mr. reddington , be advised ...
director arriving on the eighth floor in five ,
four , three , two ...
baz .
he knows .
give it a second .
everybody likes apples .
is my wife here ?
dr. h. is with your wife now .
i &apos;ll take you back .
where &apos;s dorothy today ?
she &apos;s out . her daughter is sick .
i &apos;m pamela .
don &apos;t worry .
lynda &apos;s fine .
he &apos;s not coming .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s coming , lynda .
i &apos;ll try his office again .
director &apos;s line .
doctor huffnagel here .
i &apos;m sorry to call again ,
but i &apos;m here with lynda ,
and she &apos;s wondering if peter is on his way .
what do you mean ?
the director got to your office two minutes ago .
no . he didn &apos;t . if he had --
he &apos;s under . let &apos;s move .
i &apos;m looking for the director .
so are we . his wife is waiting --
hey ! you can &apos;t go in there .
where is he ? where is peter ?
what &apos;s going on ? where the hell are you guys ?
we &apos;re in the doctor &apos;s office . i &apos;m in the waiting room .
no , you &apos;re not .
the director &apos;s not here .
they took a freight elevator .
okay . te llamo .
peter ! welcome back .
boy , you were out !
like carrying a bag of boulders .
what the hell have you done ?
i envy anyone who can sleep soundly on a plane .
then again , i &apos;ve never been injected with propofol .
you have the post toasties ?
where the hell are we ?
what is this ? i &apos;m -- i &apos;m your hostage now ?
heavens , no . nothing nearly so pedestrian .
the fact is , you &apos;re not my prisoner at all .
you &apos;re officially in the custody
of the bolivarian republic of venezuela .
you must know mr. diaz ,
foreign minister
and national security advisor to the venezuelan president .
mr. kotsiopulos .
on behalf of my government ,
you are hereby under arrest for war crimes
and crimes against humanity
in violation of the geneva convention
and international law , as established
by the 1998 rome statute .
oh , my god .
oh , your god can &apos;t help you now , peter .
you &apos;re traveling over the atlantic ,
on the venezuelan president &apos;s airbus ,
on your way to the hague .
you &apos;re insane .
i wouldn &apos;t know .
but you &apos;re going to have the distinguished honor
of becoming the first american official ever
to be charged with even a single war crime ,
let alone the slew of them
you will undoubtedly be accused of
before the week is out .
this won &apos;t happen .
united states isn &apos;t party to the rome treaty .
we don &apos;t recognize its authority .
but venezuela does .
and cases can be referred to the court
by any country that is a signatory .
you know as well as i do , even better given your position ,
the international court has been investigating
the u.s. government and the c.i.a.
for any number of alleged crimes .
the drone program ,
the rendition of foreign citizens ,
torture as a means of interrogation .
the chief prosecutor has made it clear .
he does not need american permission to move forward .
he needs an american in the flesh .
the court will not try anyone in absentia .
so far , no country has had the courage to deliver
one of your countrymen to the court until now .
you &apos;re a trendsetter , peter . who knew ?
i am the c.i.a. director of clandestine services .
do you have any idea what &apos;s gonna happen to you ?
this is an act of war .
my government will never let it stand .
precisely what i &apos;m counting on .
laurel hitchin &apos;s office .
good afternoon .
raymond reddington calling for laurel .
peter , please , do sit .
that &apos;s the judge reven wright selected ?
the personal friend she said we could trust ?
she said he would be fair , not go easy on you .
he approved you going to fort meade ,
which he didn &apos;t have to do .
and he agreed to keep ressler as your transport .
those are both wins .
about time we introduce our russian friend to the world .
he did it ? they got the director ?
i &apos;ll be back soon .
be right downstairs , though , if you need anything .
come on . come on , come on .
look over here . over here . is he under arrest ?
who is this ? does this have to do with agent keen ?
i &apos;ll tell your sister you say hello .
is he under arrest ? who is it ? come on .
tell us who it is !
all right , i &apos;ll make a statement , a brief statement .
an alleged cabal operative , known only as karakurt ,
has been taken into custody .
in connection with the orea bombing
and the murder of senator hawkins .
what does that mean ? is he an accomplice ?
or are you saying elizabeth keen is innocent ?
the f.b.i. now believes that elizabeth keen ,
agent elizabeth keen , was not responsible for those crimes .
what about the attorney general ?
i can &apos;t answer that at this time ,
but i will say this arrest has yielded new evidence ,
and our investigation into this so @-@ called cabal continues .
that &apos;ll be all for now .
i need to hear peter &apos;s voice to confirm that he &apos;s alive .
i am here , laurel .
i was abducted .
i appear to be on a veneruelan jet somewhere over the atlantic .
mr. diaz , do you have any concept of the wrath
you are bringing down on the government
and people of your country ?
threats .
this is how the u.s. responds to conflict .
including a legitimate claim
that your government &apos;s actions have violated international law .
laurel , raymond here .
here &apos;s where we stand .
in a handful of hours , this jet will land in rotterdam ,
it will be met by the dutch federal police ,
who will escort the director to &apos; s @-@ gravenhage ,
where the global spectacle of a high @-@ ranking american official
charged with war crimes will begin .
the sound of acquiescence .
what do you want ?
what i &apos;ve wanted since the beginning --
for you to exonerate elizabeth keen .
no .
fine . but after you hang up with me ,
your next call had better be to your president .
tell him you refused to prevent your country
from being humiliated , implicated ,
and probably convicted .
this is quite a can of worms , laurel .
if you have any doubts about that , turn on your television .
... alleged cabal operative known only as karakurt
has been taken into custdy
in connection with the orea bombing ...
what ? this is supposed to scare me ?
quite the opposite .
now you may be concerned that exonerating agent keen
will make you and your government look ,
well , foolish ,
but i &apos;m handing you the solution .
yes , you got it wrong , but thank heavens
you finally found the real culprit .
of course , my offer will get considerably less generous
if anything should happen to elizabeth keen .
you &apos;ll call me back .
all set , liz .
the transport team is ready . time to go .
how &apos;s the russian ?
a little tense .
thank you .
be careful , both of you .
we &apos;re travelling .
pick up the phone , damn it .
what the hell do you want ?
stop the transport . it &apos;s not safe .
keep her in the cell . the corridors are not safe .
what ? what are you -- what are you talking about ?
the corridors are not safe .
gun !
okay , your girl just got a temporary reprieve .
now , hy--
hypothetically , if we agree to your terms ,
what kind of deal are you looking for ?
my attorney will explain everything .
his name is marvin gerard .
gerard ? the fugitive ?
the man you broke out of federal prison ?
the same .
damn it , diane !
i told you . i &apos;m not to be disturbed .
sorry , ms. hitchin ,
but there &apos;s a marvin gerard here to see you ?
he says you &apos;re expecting him .
i &apos;m sealing off the entire floor .
we &apos;re not going anywhere with these marshals .
we sit tight until reddington gets in touch with us .
what the hell happened out there ?
i don &apos;t know .
i got a call from laurel hitchin warning me that it wasn &apos;t safe .
it was her hit . why would she call it off ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s reddington . he must be negotiating a deal .
liz , it &apos;s working .
laurel , i will not allow you to do this .
we can fight the hague .
the administration will never let --
no , the administration won &apos;t fight this , peter ,
because they &apos;re not gonna ever hear about it , you understand ?
none of this ever happened .
raymond , i &apos;m reviewing the deal they presented .
and for the most part , it &apos;s what you asked for .
with one glaring exception .
keen will be exonerated for the orea attack
and the hawkins murder .
but they are insisting on a plea of guilty
for the killing of tom connolly .
that doesn &apos;t work , laurel .
it &apos;s the best we can do .
i just spoke with the acting a.g.
she shot connolly in front of witnesses .
he was orchestrating a conspiracy to frame agent keen
and implicate her colleagues .
she killed him , and not in self @-@ defense .
and tom connolly was well @-@ liked .
look , i had to sell this deal .
it &apos;s not gonna get any better .
it &apos;s involuntary manslaughter . no jail time . that &apos;s the offer .
then this plane will land .
we &apos;ve bent as far as we can go .
if you pass on the this deal ,
then we &apos;ll just take our chances at the hague .
pick up the phone , marvin .
can you excuse me ?
marvin ?
it &apos;s a good deal , red .
bottom line , it keeps her safe and out of prison .
and frankly ...
it &apos;s much better than i thought you &apos;d ever get .
get it done .
hand the phone to laurel .
ms. hitchin .
yeah ?
okay , laurel , we have a deal .
once you &apos;ve made a public announcement ,
i &apos;ll drop the director somewhere safe .
mmm , no . uh , just a sec .
look , um ...
peter &apos;s become a @-@ a liability .
if , uh , if we take care of this problem for you ,
we would ask that you take care of that problem for us .
i expected as much .
so we &apos;re done ?
not quite .
there &apos;s one more thing , and it &apos;s not negotiable .
this is official ?
they &apos;re willing to say i &apos;m innocent ?
publicly ,
of every charge against you except the connolly shooting .
for that , you &apos;d enter a plea of guilty
to involuntary manslaughter .
with three years of probation ?
i &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
but i &apos;d be pleading guilty to a homicide .
they &apos;re taking away my badge .
if i sign this , i &apos;ll never be an agent again .
no . but the task force would continue .
cooper would be cleared , put back in charge ,
and you keep working with reddington
to assist the government as an asset we employ ,
not as an active agent .
here .
this is for you .
lizzy . have you seen the deal ?
yes .
it &apos;s not everything we wanted ,
but it &apos;s close .
you &apos;ll be safe . you &apos;ll be free .
but i won &apos;t be an agent .
i &apos;ll be an asset like you .
yes .
i told you some time ago , when you pulled that trigger ,
you crossed a threshold .
you stepped from your world into mine .
i wish i could deliver the perfect outcome ,
but i &apos;m afraid ...
this is ...
... fair .
fairness is overrated .
and maybe there &apos;s a way to get you all the way back .
but for now , lizzy , for today ,
sign the deal .
got a pen ?
the united states government has confirmed
that the alleged criminal conspiracy known as &quot; the cabal &quot;
is real .
this conspiracy has as its goal
one key objective -- to inflame tensions with russia
and return the world to a cold war posture .
in an effort to accomplish this ,
members of the conspiracy framed
f.b.i. agent elizabeth keen ,
making it appear as if she were a russian sleeper agent .
these crimes were actually committed by an assassin
known only by his code name , karakurt .
and i am proud to announce that due to outstanding work
by some of this country &apos;s best and brightest ,
led by special agent donald ressler --
karakurt is now in federal custody .
what about the attorney general ?
it saddens me greatly to say this ,
but the evidence overwhelmingly shows
that tom connolly , the former attorney general ,
was a key member of this cabal .
and while ms. keen did fire the shot that killed him ,
earlier today a judge accepted her plea
to the charge of involuntary manslaughter ,
approved by us , along with mandatory probation .
and tom connolly wasn &apos;t alone .
we have to now face the hard truth :
there are enemies of amea within our own ranks .
in fact , just a short time ago ,
i learned that the director of the clandestine service
of the c.i.a. , mr. peter kotsiopulos ,
is also part of this conspiracy
and has apparently fled the country .
hello , peter .
okay , that &apos;s my statement .
but on a personal note -- please .
i just wanna say ,
when i think of the horrifying nightmare
that elizabeth keen has endured --
branded a traitor , hunted as a fugitive
by the very law enforcement agency
she swore an oath to serve ...
well , there are no words .
there is no apology i can give on behalf of the government
that could ever be sufficient .
i only hope that she can take some solace
in the knowledge that in the end ,
the system worked .
thank you .
i know who you really are , raymond .
who you are to her .
and i know why you did this .
does she ?
i can &apos;t think of even one set of circumstances
in which that would be any of your business .
we &apos;ve been descending for some time now .
looks like we &apos;ll be able to drop you off in time for dinner .
