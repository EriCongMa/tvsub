...to trial for a crime punishable by imprisonment
unless the initial charge has been brought by indictment of a grand jury.
And that's where you come in.
You are 16 citizens who have been given an immense responsibility.
You must decide a man's fate.
My name is Wendy Scott-Carr,
and this is Deputy State's Attorney Cary Agos
and ASA Dana Lodge.
We are the prosecution.
Unlike a trial, there is no defense.
You will only hear our case.
It is up to us to convince you
that there's probable cause to bring William Paul Gardner to trial.
Sorry. Thanks for waiting.
Is everything all right?
Uh, no. I wanted to talk to you
before I broke this to the equity partners and associates.
Is this about Will?
Yes. A grand jury has been impaneled,
and our expectation is he will be indicted within the next two days.
I...
What's the charge?
Judicial bribery.
Of course, it's not true.
But the, uh...
the State's Attorney
believes that Will arranged bets between judges
and bookies at his Wednesday night basketball game.
I...
I-I didn't know it was that serious.
It is.
Felony bribery-- three to seven years.
I'm sorry, I really should go.
Is it Wendy Scott-Carr or Peter?
Uh, both, I should think.
Peter has put Wendy Scott-Carr in charge of the prosecution.
What can I do?
I don't want you to feel responsible
or obligated to do anything.
I mean, "Responsible" is the wrong word.
We've never considered you an...
extension of the State's Attorney's Office,
and you've never acted like one. So...
again, I leave it to you.
Oh, Alicia, hi.
Would you like me to help Mr. Gold today?
Yes.
Is there anything that you need help with?
Nope.
Thank you.
Alicia.
I just...I have to rush off.
What's wrong? What do you need?
No, nothing. It's-it's about Jackie,
but we can talk about it later.
Oh, well, 8:00 tonight?
Sure. Great.
'Kay.
I'm sorry.
No. Why? I am.
I didn't tell you because I didn't want this to become...
You do not need to explain.
This is legal. It's not personal.
If I told you, it would become per...
Will, I'm a lawyer.
I'm a third-year associate in your firm.
So use me.
Ms. Tascioni,
Hello.
Hello again.
We seem to meet under a lot of circumstances like these.
We do.
I want to help.
Okay.
With what?
With what I know about the State's Attorney.
I was hired as an investigator by the State's Attorney's Office.
And in this capacity,
did you come to review Mr. Gardner's cases?
I did. And...
I was surprised by how many cases, both civil and criminal,
in which he achieved a successful verdict.
Could you elaborate?
On average, you would expect a 60% win rate as a ceiling.
And what did you find with Mr. Gardner's cases?
He had 75% wins.
Did you find anything suspicious
with regards to which judges
decided favorably for Mr. Gardner?
Yeah. Three judges decided favorably for Mr. Gardner 95% of the time.
They were Judge Winter, Judge Dunaway and Parks.
And what else did you discover about these three judges?
They all played regularly in a pickup basketball game
on Wednesday nights, run by Will Gardner.
Thank you, Mr. Wiley.
Okay, so the strategy is this.
Hello, Ms. Lockhart.
Hello.
You're, uh, you're up next.
I know. Thank you.
How did the partners take it?
They were concerned.
We'll work the phones this afternoon to hand-hold clients.
How are things here?
Uh, we were just... going over strategy.
Mrs. Florrick.
You can join us.
Yes.
Okay, so here's the thing.
Grand juries indict; that's what they do,
hamburgers and all.
Ham sandwiches.
Yes.
So, you're gonna get indicted, unless--
I like that pen.
Thank you.
Unless someone pulls the plug.
Someone higher.
The State's Attorney.
Yes. You have an audience of one in there, Ms. Lockhart.
Who?
Cary Agos.
He defers to the State's Attorney.
Wendy Scott-Carr does not.
She's...
No, that's right; she's her own person.
So you need to keep bringing the testimony back to Peter Florrick.
That'll get Cary talking to Peter.
That's right. If you want to stop this
at the grand jury stage,
you need to get the State's Attorney to stop it,
and he'll only stop it if it looks like it'll hurt him.
You see?
Yes. Good.
Excuse me.
Hello, Eli.
Hello, Alicia.
Would you like to guess what's wrong with this picture?
I'm not there?
Yes. I ask for Alicia;
I get Alicia lite.
This is GLAC, Alicia, GLAC--
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance of Chicago.
They need someone to campaign
against the Defense of Marriage Act.
I needed you.
Why me?
Because you...
Because you're a gay icon.
Excuse me?
I didn't decide it.
Where are you getting this?
The gay blogosphere.
You're one of those spurned wives.
Oh, dear Lord.
Your suffering has made you iconic.
They have a lot of money to fight DOMA.
This means a lot of money.
Eli, as much as it would gratify me
to sit beside you signing autographs,
you are the one they want
you don't need window-dressing.
Oh, yes, Alicia, give me a pep talk.
Caitlin is capable. She's smart.
She's studious. She's David Lee's niece,
and that means something to Spencer Roth.
She's what?
David Lee's niece
David Lee's niece. The divorce attorney?
Yeah, family law. Why?
I'll be waiting by the phone!
You and I need to talk, Alicia.
Don't make me wait. Don't you dare. It'll get ugly.
Eli!
Stacie.
It's so good to see you!
And you.
We're up for all the same jobs, aren't we?
We should be friends.
We shouldn't be enemies.
The best of friends.
So, the Defense of Marriage Act,
what's your pitch on that?
It's wrong.
I want to learn from you, Eli.
There's so much I can learn.
I want to have lunch.
Let's do.
No.
Not lunch. Drinks.
Hot drinks.
There are these drinks-- mulled wine with brandy.
They're amazing.
Sounds good.
I'm gonna call you.
Gay and Lesbian Alliance of Chicago.
How may I connect you?
Hello. This is Stacie Hall's assistant.
I'm having trouble texting her.
Could you get her an immediate message?
I know she's in a meeting with Spencer Roth.
Sure. What is it?
Could you tell her that her 11:00 meeting with Rush
has moved to noon.
With Rush?
Yes. Limbaugh.
Do you want me to spell that for you?
No, I think I've got it.
You and Mr. Gardner have known each other for...
how many years?
Eight years.
And you were originally partners in opposing firms?
Yes.
And you knew about
his troubles at his first Baltimore firm?
I'll need more clarity
in order to answer that question.
My apologies.
You knew that he took $45,000
from a client's account to pay off a gambling debt?
All I knew is what I heard from you
when you questioned me in my office, Ms. Scott-Carr,
and that Peter Florrick,
the State's Attorney, doesn't feel there's enough
evidence there to prosecute him.
I can understand your defensiveness.
Really? I didn't think I was being defensive,
I thought I was being clear.
Then let's continue to be clear.
Have you ever been to one of Mr. Gardner's pickup games?
No.
Why not?
I don't play basketball.
Has he asked you to go?
Uh, yes.
And why did he ask you to go
if you didn't play basketball?
He said it was a good place,
to meet judges and prosecutors who matter.
For example, Peter Florrick,
the current State's Attorney, often participated in the pickup games.
But you decided not to go to these games.
Now, wasn't that because you thought there was something
corrupt about these relationships?
No. Oddly, it was because
I didn't play basketball.
I don't think there's anything wrong
for judges and lawyers to unwind over sports.
And my guess is that the current State's Attorney
doesn't think so either, or he wouldn't participate.
What's she doing?
Tying Peter to it.
Let's talk about one particular lawsuit--
the McDermott case.
Now, this was a lawsuit brought by a family
whose child died from eating food tainted with peanut oil.
Yes.
And this was a client
you brought into the firm.
Yes.
But Will Gardner requested to take it over from you.
Yes.
Why?
He thought he would be better.
But it was only after a change of courts,
after Judge Parks had taken over the case,
that Will requested this switch?
Take your time, Ms. Lockhart.
Yes.
And didn't you explain this switch to your associates
as being due to the fact that
Mr. Gardner had a better relationship with Judge Parks?
Yes.
How did it go?
Will, do you have a moment?
Why did we win the McDermott case?
They asked you about the McDermott case?
They asked me almost exclusively about the McDermott case.
Why did we win it?
It was a good case.
No, it wasn't.
We argued it well.
You argued it well.
I wasn't there.
Then I argued it well.
They asked me questions
about my conversations with the associates.
How would they know that?
You and I should talk.
I don't want to see Alicia prosecuted either.
I need more.
The McDermott file doesn't connect the dots.
It's not me. It's Wendy.
Give me more, and we'll tear it up.
The rider evidence that can hurt Alicia?
We'll tear it up.
You got to smile.
I got to smile?
Yes, 'cause the grand jury will perceive your attitude as hostile if it's...
hostile.
Please?
Since you said "Please."
So, we were worried about the McDermott case,
and here we are,
dealing with questions about the McDermott case.
Yes, we were just discussing that.
And their questions would suggest
some deeper familiarity, as if someone were...
talking to them.
I'm gonna check into it.
Good.
She's great.
Yeah.
Please stay on the line
and your call will be answered...
Mr. Gold?
Here are your xeroxes.
Oh, good. Thanks.
And could you get a few things from downstairs?
Here's a list.
Um, sure, definitely.
I will be right back.
Good.
Sooner, the better.
And hello, Alicia.
Hello.
Getting close to Caitlin, are we?
Yes. She's a real go-getter.
Not a moment of complaint.
She made these copies for you?
Yup. Very important stuff.
These are from last year.
Yes.
And who knows when I may need them again.
So, who are we acting out against, Eli? David Lee?
Me? The concept of first-year associates?
Might there be a simpler explanation?
I need someone to free me up so I can... work.
There are paralegals for that.
I like Caitlin.
You wanted to talk?
Yes, about attitudes, and let's start with yours.
Alicia?
I outrank you.
I am an equity partner, you're a third-year associate.
And I feel--
and yes, you are making me resort to marriage counseling speak--
I feel that you're treating me
with the same degree of disregard
as when I was your husband's campaign strategist,
and I think that is wrong.
Not kill-a-puppy wrong, but wrong, as in incorrect.
Working off old information.
And I think we all need
to reevaluate our working relationship here.
You're right.
What do you need?
I need you to help me with my pitch.
Spencer Roth has asked us in
to pitch to all of GLAC on Wednesday.
Okay. Let's get going.
No.
I'm sorry. I think I interrupted you.
You said in an interview in Chicago magazine,
quote, "What I love about Will Gardner is he is as sneaky
as I am," End quote.
Do you still believe that?
I think I meant "Sneakily charming."
So, that's why the next line reads:
"The sneaky thing is to cross that ethical line
and not lose track of your client."
Is that what you meant?
Uh... something like that.
You did contract work for Judge Parks, didn't you?
I did.
His wife was ill,
and you helped him with the will and his children's trust?
If by "Helped" You mean he paid me, yes.
But he paid you less than what was usual for this type of work?
No, he paid what was fair,
considering the will and trust
were simpler than most.
Who brought Judge Parks to you as a client?
Wasn't it Will Gardner?
That's probably right.
And wasn't the work a payoff for Judge Parks
deciding the McDermott case for you?
It's an odd payoff, to charge him for work I did.
Isn't that a conflict of interest, sir?
No more than the trust work I did for Peter Florrick,
the current State's Attorney.
Please answer the question, Mr. Lee.
Oh, I thought I was, ma'am.
I'm making an honest comparison
to other work I did for your boss, Peter Florrick--
trust work for which I charged even less than Judge Parks.
If this is a conflict of interest... isn't that?
That's how a pro does it.
You're welcome.
What did they ask?
You and Judge Parks.
Everything was you and Judge Parks.
Daddy's a balloon.
Where's the pin?
Oh, hey, there. I'm sorry.
Um, I was wondering if you might know
where there was a restroom that had a changing table?
Oh, my goodness, look at that face.
Yeah, she's waking up.
Are you gonna go to the park?
I have a sweet tooth.
Yeah, I can see that.
Does it taste better with whipped cream?
Is there anything that doesn't taste better with whipped cream?
Tell me when.
When. When.
To Eli and Stacie, new friends.
Hmm. It's very, very sweet.
Mmm, wait till you get to the bottom.
So, Rush Limbaugh, huh?
Yeah.
How do you explain that one?
Mm. I was meeting him to argue against DOMA.
Nice. And they believed you?
Oh, I'm convincing when I have to be.
Mmm. Fish. It burns.
Fish?
Oh, I'm trying not to swear.
Everybody swears these days. Have you noticed?
Old ladies, young girls.
Really, everybody.
I have to tell you something.
Okay.
All right.
But I have to steel myself first.
I desire you.
I'm serious.
I desire you, Eli.
Every part of you.
Your eyes,
your hair.
I want to take you right now, right here
on the floor of this bar.
Well, go ahead.
I'm serious.
I know you are.
Make the first move.
Right here.
I'm ready.
You.
No, you're the one who desires me.
I'm pliable.
So...
ply me.
It's Sun Tzu, hmm?
Destabilizing your enemy?
You know the only problem with Sun Tzu?
He never fought the Jews.
We're Masada, baby.
We don't mess around with mind games.
We use knives.
You're Jewish?
You're a nice girl.
With your sweet little drinks and your giggle,
but you're not playing in the little leagues anymore.
Put out your hand.
Why?
Put it out.
And this is supposed to what?
Okay, this is... this is lacking subtlety.
No, tell me about Masada.
960 dead?
All those big, strong Jewish warriors?
I'll talk to Jackie.
Good, thank you.
I just don't want things turning sour.
They won't. They won't.
How are things here?
Good.
Work is hard,
of course, because of this grand jury investigation.
What's going on, Peter?
I don't think we can have this conversation.
Actually, we need to have this conversation.
It has nothing to do with us.
Peter, how can it not?
Because I won't let it;
that's why I chose Wendy Scott-Carr,
so that it wouldn't.
She's making it worse.
No, she isn't.
She's not me; I don't control her.
But that's the problem, Peter.
It keeps your hands clean at the expense of...
At the expense of who?
Will?
No, my firm.
And Will.
Yes, my boss.
The boss who you're sleeping with?
Peter, if that's the issue here,
then let's talk about that.
Of course that's the issue!
There's nothing between us.
My God, you have changed.
I used to be able to tell when you lied.
You think I'm lying?
I think you're manipulating the truth like a pro.
Well, you would know about pros.
Well, you got me there.
What do you want, Alicia?
I want you to stop this grand jury.
No.
That's what I used to do.
Things that worked, but were wrong.
Not doing that anymore.
Peter, your...
problem wasn't that you did things that were wrong.
Your problem was that you did things that were wrong against your family.
That may be so, but that has nothing to do with this.
Will Gardner is not my family.
Good night.
Please state your name for the record?
Robert Parks.
I'm a presiding justice in Cook County's third municipal district.
Thank you, sir.
Your Honor.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Is it fair to say that you are
a reluctant witness here today, Your Honor?
It is fair to say that I believe this is a witch hunt.
And I think you're trying to criminalize behavior
that is far from criminal.
And what behavior is that?
Friendship and acquaintances between justices and attorneys outside work.
Did the attorney, Will Gardner, ever offer you a bribe, Your Honor?
Upon the advice of counsel, I am here today to assert my right
under the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination.
Did you ever make a illegal bets through Will Gardner
with the bookie Jonathan Meade?
Upon the advice of counsel, my answer to this question and all your questions
will be to assert my right under the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination.
I understand, Your Honor.
You don't understand a thing.
You're attempting to suggest that
there is something nefarious here, when you know for a fact
that any judge you haul in here would take the Fifth.
Excuse me, Your Honor?
You either take the Fifth,
or you leave yourself open to questions.
Did you meet with Will Gardner yesterday?
Upon the advice of counsel,
I continue to assert my rights under the Fifth Amendment.
Is this a photo of you meeting with Will Gardner yesterday?
Upon the advice of counsel, I insist on my Fifth Amendment rights.
You setting me up?
Excuse me, Your Honor?
They have a photo, from yesterday.
You brought them to me.
You go down, you're not taking me.
Okay, I can see there is some kind of strategy going on here.
We can't say.
I just want to know one thing.
Is it illegal?
No.
Good.
You two behave now.
Yeah?
I just wanted to see how you're doing.
I'm good.
Up next. Probably another 30 minutes.
Are you...?
I'm fine.
No, are you taking the Fifth?
I don't know.
Elsbeth thinks I should.
It's the smart move.
Will... I'm sorry.
Don't be.
I am.
Well, then be sorry because it's happening.
Don't be sorry because of anything else.
Okay. Do good.
Always.
Well, well, it's family law, darkening my halls.
Nora, could you ask Caitlin to come in here, please?
Something fell off my desk.
So...
So...
Caitlin's not cleaning this up.
Oh, yes, she is.
It's such a double-edged sword, isn't it?
Nepotism gets you the job, but then you catch all the poop
your uncle should.
"Poop"?
I'm trying not to swear so much.
How's the campaign going for Peter Florrick?
I hope well.
Because his wife and I have been chatting.
As her divorce lawyer,
of course, attorney-client privilege applies,
and I can't really share anything,
but, uh, I hope the campaign is going well.
Yes, Mr. Gold?
Oh, hi.
Hi, Caitlin. How are you?
Good. Uh, what was it you needed?
No, nothing. Eli's fine.
Okay.
Well, give a call if you need anything.
And I have your xeroxes.
Thanks, Caitlin.
There's not much I love in life. I like money.
I don't love money.
Is this going to be long?
But I do love my niece.
She is all that is good in the world.
And I think you ought to clean that up.
Good afternoon, Mr. Gardner.
Ms. Scott-Carr.
Shall we start from the beginning here?
Did you meet with Judge Parks yesterday?
Yes, I did meet with Judge Parks yesterday.
I see. Um, thank you, sir.
And thank you for not taking the Fifth.
You're welcome.
This is you in this picture?
Yes.
And what is in this envelope
you handed to Judge Parks?
Money.
Okay.
And, um, was there an agreement
between you and Judge Parks based on the exchange of this cash?
Yes.
And what was that?
That he would give it to UNICEF
for their immunization drive in Uganda.
Uh, and, um, how-how much money did you give him?
$2,000.
For UNICEF?
I mean, isn't that
a lot of money to be giving to UNICEF?
It is.
And why did you give him all that?
Because I think kids in Uganda should be immunized.
And isn't this just a little bit suspicious
that you gave this money on the eve
of your testifying here?
I don't know. I hadn't thought of it.
And why should we trust you
that this money was, in fact, for UNICEF?
Because I have a receipt.
Okay. Let's see.
I have some notes here from...
Thank you.
This is a copy of an e-mail from you to Judge Parks,
exchanging information about which settlement
would be agreeable to your client.
Really? Where did you get it?
When I am the subject of a grand jury investigation, Mr. Gardner,
you may ask me that.
Are these e-mails from you to Judge Parks?
No.
Could you read there?
To whom are these e-mails addressed?
It says, "Judge Parks,"
but I never sent these to him.
Someone must've typed over the real addressee.
And why would someone do that?
I have no idea, you just handed it to me,
but the original e-mails...
...are here.
Let's turn now to Judge Parks.
But don't you want to know who the e-mails were really addressed to?
No, that's not necessary.
They were addressed to my partner, Diane Lockhart.
Excuse me, Mr. Gardner?
And it seemed only natural to discuss the award amount.
Mr. Gardner, that was not my question.
Please strike that from the record!
You fooled me?
Yeah.
Go ahead.
What?
Hit me.
It'll make you feel better.
Okay, thank you. Thank you for that.
I owe you.
No, you don't.
Okay, you two, it's not over yet.
She promised a new subpoena.
What I'm worried is she...
It's not Kalinda...
But she's angry now.
So she goes where?
The whole firm?
Personal. She...
You're vulnerable somewhere, right?
You gave her the McDermott case as some big fat juicy...
bait, right?
So she wouldn't go after your real vulnerability?
Yes.
So...
Who would she subpoena now?
Any word on Mr. Gardner?
Not yet.
Did I do something wrong?
Did you...?
Do you know why Mr. Gold is being so cold to me now?
Oh, I didn't think he was.
I thought he was overworking you.
No. He's not even talking to me now.
Did I do something wrong?
No. I wouldn't worry.
He seems distracted.
I wanted to tell him something about the meeting,
but he won't listen.
What?
Yeah, what do you need?
Well, I'm in bed, thinking of you.
No, you're not.
You know my meeting's in five minutes,
and you're trying to throw me off my game.
Well, that's true, but I'm still thinking of you.
Of course, you are. Do you hear my voice?
I am not thrown.
Well, you shouldn't have wimped out last night, Eli.
You'd be right here in my bed with me.
I gotta go now, Ms. Hall, and kick your ass.
But it's been nice talking to you.
Eli, sorry to keep you waiting.
Spencer, no trouble.
Remember Mrs. Florrick?
I promised I'd drag her along.
Yes, hello, Alicia.
That's a beautiful suit.
Oh, thank you. Um,
do you mind if we just take one second?
No problem. I'll be right back.
What the heck?
Tell him, Caitlin.
I'm sorry. I wanted to get to you earlier.
This is not about the Defense of Marriage Act, Eli.
I was studying up on this meeting,
and one thing that didn't make sense
is why GLAC needed a crisis manager
to fight against the Defense of Marriage Act
when, in fact, the National Committee was handling it.
And then I was reading some gay blogs...
Can we talk about this after the meeting?
Eli, this is the meeting.
Spencer Roth wrote a letter
in support of the proposed AT&T merger
with T-Mobile as acting head of GLAC.
AT&T supposedly gave GLAC a $60,000 grant.
When was this?
Last week.
This isn't about the Defense of Marriage Act.
This is about damage control.
The GLAC board doesn't want to be criticized
for its involvement in this merger.
But why say it's about the Defense of Marriage?
Because they don't want to make it public
they're shopping for crisis managers.
We have to change the pitch right now.
Attacking the GLAC board is attacking gays.
Eli.
Too cynical?
Thank Caitlin.
Thank you.
Uh-oh. This is about Will.
I'll catch up.
Hello.
I don't understand.
I know.
I thought Wendy Scott-Carr
was targeting the McDermott case.
I never worked on that.
I know.
So... why?
Well, she'll probably push you on things
Mr. Gardner did that she
could paint as legally questionable.
A prosecutor can ask anything at a grand jury hearing.
So what do you know that could hurt him?
Alicia Florrick.
F-l-o-r-r-i-c-k.
The same spelling as my husband Peter, the State's Attorney.
Thank you.
For the sake of disclosure,
have we met before?
Yes, last year, during the State's Attorney election.
I believe you lost to my husband.
How long have you worked at Lockhart/Gardner, Mrs. Florrick?
Two and a half years.
Who hired you?
Will Gardner.
You were friends in college?
Yes, at Georgetown.
How long had it been since you'd last practiced law?
13 years.
I took time off to raise my children.
A 13-year layoff.
That was quite generous of Mr. Gardner.
Have you ever seen Mr. Gardner do anything that you'd consider illegal?
Not that I recall.
Since joining his firm, at any time,
have you been engaged in a sexual relationship with Mr. Gardner?
I don't see how that's relevant.
The jury is entitled
to know the true nature of your relationship with him.
This line of questioning is inappropriate.
The jury needs to know she has an incentive to protect him.
You asked me what I thought about their relationship,
and I told you... in confidence.
If you're not comfortable, Mr. Agos,
you are free to step out.
Mrs. Florrick, one more time.
While working at his firm, at any time,
have you and Will Gardner engaged
in a sexual relationship?
Yes.
Is this sexual relationship still active?
No.
When did this relationship begin?
In the spring.
And when did it end?
A few months ago.
During the course of this relationship with Mr. Gardner,
was your office moved to the 28th floor,
the same floor as the senior partners'?
Yes.
And in that time, had you been advised
that you were on a track to make partner?
Mrs. Florrick, would you please take your seat?
No.
I need to ask you to sit.
No. Thank you.
The witness has not been excused!
You are out of control.
Mrs. Florrick, if you do not sit back down,
I will have you held in contempt.
Fine. Arrest me.
Mrs. Florrick?
Hi. You zipped out of there.
I didn't get a chance to do a postmortem.
The transcript of the hearing-- it'll be released to the public?
Only if Mr. Gardner's indicted.
Otherwise, it stays sealed.
What happened in there?
I've got to talk to my kids.
You're so funny.
You're so spontaneous.
Like a youth in May. Say when.
Keep going. Keep... Yeah, that's perfect.
So, what's the surprise?
You called saying you had a surprise?
Yes, um...
The surprise is...
I desire you, too.
Oh, now you're just trying to throw me off my game?
I am, but I still desire you.
Really? Okay? Well, then let's go do something about it.
My apartment's 15 minutes away.
Mine's ten. You're playing chicken.
I am, and I'm good at it.
Mm. You don't see me swerving off the road.
Then don't.
We're gonna crash.
Unless you swerve.
I got the GLAC account.
Oh, what's happened?
Where's that desire?
I don't believe you.
You were expecting a call from GLAC about an hour ago.
You didn't get it.
I did.
Oh, fish.
I still desire you, Stacie.
The way a victor desires his spoils.
That's right.
Get those tiny little wheels turning in your head.
"Which way should I play this?
Contrite and compliant, or tough and brash?"
Okay. Let's go.
Let's have intercourse.
Ladies and gentlemen of the grand jury,
the hour has grown late.
If there are no further questions,
the People of Illinois ask that you vote a true bill
to indict Mr. Gardner on the charges of conspiracy to commit bribery
and interfering with a judicial officer,
class three and class two felonies.
Please signify by raising your hands.
I've got a question?
Excuse me?
You said, if there are no further questions.
I have a question.
Yes. I'm sorry, please.
Who is this Peter everyone was talking about?
That would be Peter Florrick, the State's Attorney.
He hired Ms. Scott-Carr
to conduct this investigation.
Uh-huh, okay.
So then, isn't it weird to bring in his wife?
I-I'm sorry.
By law, we are permitted to only answer questions
about the facts of the case,
but if you're asking...
I mean, who cares who she sleeps with?
If she's getting some, great.
Here's what I don't get.
Why even go after Will Gardner?
Why not that judge guy?
Well, again, by law, we are not permitted..
I mean, at least Will Gardner answered the questions
The judge just kept taking the Fifth.
I know.
I didn't get that, eith.
Maybe this judge knows Peter Florrick.
Maybe they should both be arrested...
You know what? That's-that's not...
I think Florrick and the judge are in it together.
Yeah,yeah, why don't you bring in that guy?
That was some good fishing
Hey, um,m,could you grab my robe for me, please?
Oh, yeah. Hey, what do you think of that?
I mean, it's just a mock-up.
I told Vanessa a deeper blue border
would really make it pop.
You're working on my ex-wife's campaign?
Only 'cause she asked me.
She threw me a lot of business in D.C.
That's why I'm here. To see this?
Eli, I desire you.
You're home early.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I just... Um...
I want to talk to you.
What did we do?
You didn't do anything. It...
God, paranoid...
You were thinking the same thing.
Hello?
Hi. It's Kalinda.
I know. What's wrong?
Nothing.
No bill.
What? I don't... I don't understand.
They didn't indict a ham sandwich.
You're kidding?
No. Will is free.
How is that possible?
Um, we don't know.
We're still trying to figure that out.
You should come on down here. We're having a party.
Oh, um, no. Thanks, though.
And... Kalinda, th... thank you for calling.
No problem.
Come on, let's dance.
Oh, no, I don't dance.
No, I have to drink a lot to dance,
and I don't like to drink a lot, no.
Well, this is the one exception. Come on.
No, no. Seriously, you do it.
That was a close one.
Yes.
Let's try and reduce the excitement level from now on, shall we?
What is it, Mom?
Nothing. Just something at work.
Was it good?
Yes...
It is, oddly.
You wanted to talk to us?
I did, didn't I?
I haven't been the best of moms.
Mom.
How?
I want to change all that.
I, um...
I think I should take a week off work,
and we should go on vacation.
Ms. Scott-Carr.
I wanted to thank you for your service.
You're excused.
Peter, we can still indict Will Gardner.
With the next grand jury, I'll-I'll take... No.
No.
We're done.
There are other ways.
Like calling my wife?
It was a strategic move.
Thank you for your service.
My assistant will validate your parking.
I'm sending these infractions of Mr. Gardner's to the bar association.
If you won't pursue him, they will.
Do what you got to do.
Now get out of my office.
