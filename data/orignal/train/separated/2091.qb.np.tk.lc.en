welcome , early risers .
the first tour of the day is always the best .
but before we get started , can anyone tell me
about the battleship we &apos;re standing on ?
hey !
the missouri was where the japanese surrendered
to allied powers to end world war ii .
very good .
&quot; mighty mo &quot; served in battles all over the world .
since 1992 , however , those guns , like the missouri herself ,
have been decommissioned ,
and now she enjoys peaceful retirement here in pearl harbor .
now let &apos;s get haze gray and underway ,
which is ship talk for &quot; we &apos;re on the move . &quot;
freeze ! don &apos;t move !
hands up !
hands in the air !
down , down , down !
alright , alright , i &apos;m sorry .
drop your weapon .
i didn &apos;t do it !
drop your weapon now !
i didn &apos;t kill my wife !
commander mcgarrett , detective williams .
i wish we were meeting under better circumstances .
laura hills .
i recently took over as governor jamison &apos;s new
public safety liaison .
what do we got ?
suspect on board is special warfare operator
second class graham wilson . seal team five .
hang on . he &apos;s a seal ?
heavily decorated .
he &apos;s holed himself up inside with an unknown number of hostages .
any contact with him since he &apos;s boarded yet ?
he told our negotiators he would start killing the hostages
if we tried to move in on him .
did he make any demands ?
just one-- find his wife &apos;s killer .
huh . that &apos;s interesting .
when did that happen ?
this morning .
her name was noreen wilson .
graham &apos;s given us four hours to find her killer .
i guess it &apos;d be too much to hope that he mentioned who did it ?
any suspects ?
yes . him .
hpd found graham at the crime scene ,
holding the murder weapon .
when they confronted him , he ran .
and he wants us to find the killer ?
i don &apos;t suppose telling him he did it would suffice , huh ?
right now my only concern is getting those hostages off that ship .
now usually , swat would handle something like this ,
but the governor seems to think
that with your background as a seal ,
that you &apos;d be better equipped to handle the situation .
him ? and me-- i &apos;m here for what , entertainment , or what ?
well , you can tell swat to sit tight .
i &apos;ll go in alone .
excuse me ?
that &apos;s just stupid .
graham &apos;s a seal .
he &apos;s been trained in close @-@ quarter combat ,
which means right now he has the high ground .
you send swat in blind ,
they &apos;re going to take heavy losses ,
and more than likely get multiple hostages killed .
if this guy didn &apos;t kill his wife ,
he deserves at least a conversation before we go in guns blazing .
if he did , and he &apos;s going to kill again ,
i &apos;ll take him out myself .
but if you want my help today , you get it my way .
i go in alone .
okay , uh , let &apos;s say i am you ,
and you are the bad guy here , okay ?
i would know that all the ways onto this ship are visible somehow .
so , how would you outsmart yourself
and get yourself onto that ship ,
without yourself seeing ... yourself ?
okay , was that an actual attempt at a question ,
or are you just kind of throwing words at each other
and hoping they make sense ?
how you gonna get on the ship without graham seeing you ? that &apos;s all .
graham &apos;s expecting a threat from land ,
not from the water .
i &apos;m just going to go for a swim .
you &apos;re going to go for a swim ?
you &apos;re serious ? and now you &apos;re shirtless . that &apos;s great .
believe it or not , i &apos;ve done this before .
you &apos;ve done this before ?
you &apos;ve snuck onto a floating museum to rescue a bunch of tourists
who are being held captive by a man
who is accused of killing his wife ?
well , i didn &apos;t mean this literally .
but look , i can &apos;t see any other way
of stopping this thing from escalating .
and we only have four hours .
i believe you .
all right , what &apos;s @-@ what &apos;s your plan ?
we &apos;re going to hold swat in position
so graham thinks we &apos;re still negotiating .
in the meantime , i &apos;ll board , try to make contact
while you investigate this murder .
i have to gain his trust ,
get him to see that we &apos;re working on his behalf .
so maybe i can get these people out safe , graham included .
but only if he feels like i actually understand him .
okay . that &apos;s great .
what happens when i investigate this case and i find out
he killed his wife-- which he most certainly did . then what ?
at least we &apos;ll know what we &apos;re dealing with .
hpd says neighbors reported
hearing screams coming from graham &apos;s house .
cops arrived , they found him with a knife in his hand .
when they tried to arrest him , he fled the scene .
they also found his seven @-@ year @-@ old daughter in the house ,
hiding under a couch .
she hasn &apos;t talked
since child welfare services took her into custody .
maybe she saw something that freaked her out .
okay , i &apos;m going to go see the kid , see if she knows anything ,
because , you know , i &apos;m the woman on the team ,
you &apos;d probably ask me to do it anyway .
no , no , it &apos;s not because you &apos;re a woman .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re a rookie , which is way worse .
now listen , i &apos;m going to have my phone on me
but don &apos;t call me , i &apos;ll call you , okay ? .
bet you used that line before .
i &apos;ll initiate contact once i &apos;m in a secure location .
that one , too .
good luck , aquaman !
easy , easy , easy , okay ?
i &apos;m here to help .
lieutenant commander steve mcgarrett .
it &apos;s about time some backup arrived .
boatswain &apos;s mate first class ed mckay , u.s. navy . retired .
you were running a tour .
yeah .
we heard shots fired , and then it was chaos ,
people running everywhere .
i was able to evac most of my group , but a few fell behind
and that lunatic took them hostage !
how many ?
seven .
and he took them that way , toward the wardroom .
okay . good work , boats .
listen , getting you off the ship right now is going to be too dangerous .
is there a safe place that you can lay low for a while ?
i &apos;m not hiding anywhere .
and you can put those blueprints away ,
because i &apos;m coming with you .
those are my people that he &apos;s got .
i walk this ship front to back , five times a day .
there &apos;s not a person alive who knows it better than i do .
certainly not some map !
okay . but i say jump , you say how high , you hear me , sailor ?
yes , sir !
and stay out of sight , no matter what i do .
you got it .
who &apos;s going to take care of lily ?
graham &apos;s sister is flying in from oklahoma .
arrives tonight .
what about on the mother &apos;s side , is no one listed locally ?
haven &apos;t found anyone yet .
has she said anything about her mother &apos;s murder ?
hasn &apos;t said a word .
thanks .
hi , lily .
my name &apos;s kono .
i bet you &apos;ve been asked a lot of questions today , huh ?
well , no more questions for now , because i &apos;m hungry ,
and i &apos;m going to go get some shave ice
if ... you want to come with me .
so you think this guy killed his wife ?
he &apos;s gone to a lot of trouble to say he didn &apos;t .
please .
hey . no talking here .
i &apos;m sorry , but sir ?
no talking !
please .
i &apos;m hypoglycemic . my husband went to get me a snack , when ...
if i don &apos;t eat something soon , i &apos;m going to pass out .
does anyone have any food for her ?
slow !
they &apos;re peanut , it &apos;s protein .
thank you .
everyone keeps completely quiet . got it ?
disobey that order and i will hurt you .
that &apos;s a promise .
broken furniture , blood spatter on the walls ...
this was a hell of a struggle .
yeah , makes a lot of sense .
graham &apos;s a navy seal ,
and his wife weighs a buck @-@ oh @-@ five , if that .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .
this should have been an easy kill .
why &apos;s it so sloppy ?
love and hate , right ?
two sides of the same coin .
that &apos;s why they call it a crime of passion .
you know , marital spat escalates ,
just like that , he snaps .
he goes from heads to tails .
first he just wants to make her suffer a little bit .
wife ends up dead .
how long were you married , again ?
it &apos;s just a theory .
hmm , wong lee .
it &apos;s the best dim sum on the island .
you read chinese ?
yeah , enough to order .
that &apos;s good to know .
for the future .
wait .
this is catching on something , give me a hand .
wait a minute , wait a minute ,
wait a minute .
no chance you also read russian , right ?
no , why ?
well , &apos; cause it &apos;s in russian .
how do you know ?
see the &quot; v &quot; s and backwards &quot; r &quot; s ?
i had this case back in jersey .
russians trying to muscle in on this crew from north bergen .
the , uh , press called it the borscht bust .
got my picture in the paper .
parents must have been very proud .
they misspelled my name .
husband &apos;s file didn &apos;t say anything about language training .
yeah , well , maybe it belonged to the victim .
let &apos;s get it translated .
what &apos;s this ?
&quot; 397 . &quot;
that &apos;s a safe deposit box key .
all right . let &apos;s get both of these checked out .
you , uh , with graham yet ?
yeah , i got him .
i got eyes on him .
he &apos;s armed .
he &apos;s holding seven hostages . behavior &apos;s pretty erratic .
oh , you mean as opposed to most hostage @-@ takers
that are calm and composed .
no , with his training ,
this scenario shouldn &apos;t bother him .
but he &apos;s paranoid , he &apos;s unstable .
you know what , check if he &apos;s been treated psychiatrically .
okay .
all right , i &apos;m in the house right now .
chin , go see if this guy &apos;s on any meds .
hey , uh , while i &apos;ve got you , uh , we found something .
there &apos;s a manuscript stashed away .
it &apos;s in russian .
and , uh , a safe deposit key .
so if it &apos;s local , uh ,
i can subpoena the contents .
good . sounds like you &apos;re making progress .
yeah . you , uh , you miss me , don &apos;t you ?
oh , yeah , i wish you were here , but you don &apos;t swim .
i don &apos;t @-@ i don &apos;t swim ?
i swim . very well , actually . i just choose not to .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
you talking to your wife ?
i &apos;m talking to my partner .
oh , graham &apos;s medicine cabinet is full @-@ on stacked .
i got sleeping pills , lithium , and clo @-@ naza @-@ pam .
clonazepam . wait a minute , that &apos;s a ...
that &apos;s an antipsychotic ,
sometimes used to treat post @-@ traumatic stress disorder .
all the prescriptions are from dr. klesko .
bottles are three weeks old , but they &apos;re practically full .
okay , this is a really stupid question ,
but what happens if graham stops taking his medicine ?
shut up ! you don &apos;t want to make me angry .
i think we just found out .
i &apos;m also thinking the longer this goes on ,
the worse it &apos;s going to get .
who &apos;s out there ?
mcgarrett , i &apos;m sorry .
go back to the office , okay ? lock the door .
stay in there .
what the hell are you going to do ?
i &apos;m going to cover you , go !
who &apos;s out there ? i swear ... i swear if you come in
i &apos;ll kill these people !
hands up !
hey . don &apos;t shoot , man .
i got lost , i was looking for the bathroom .
i don &apos;t understand , what &apos;s happening ?
hat off .
hands behind your head .
please . please don &apos;t shoot me .
turn around .
on your knees !
get down .
keep your mouth shut !
hey . hey , you okay ?
you don &apos;t look too good .
hey ! no talking here .
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s well , i think she &apos;s sick , man .
you look , take a look at her .
she &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m okay .
could @-@ could we get some water at least ?
what part of no talking do you not follow ?
dr. klesko , we got about three hours to figure this thing out .
can you tell us why you were treating graham ?
his team walked into an ambush in ba &apos;quabah , iraq .
in the crossfire were a group of children , and none of them survived .
the trauma took a huge psychological toll :
mood swings , violent outbursts .
it escalated to the point the mps were called to his house
for a domestic disturbance .
and you diagnosed him with post @-@ traumatic stress disorder .
yes , and we were making progress .
graham was showing real signs of improvement .
and then he had a setback .
what kind of setback ?
he became convinced that the drugs were clouding his judgment ,
so he started skipping doses , and that only made his paranoia worse .
it got to the point that he started experiencing blackouts .
blackouts ? what , you mean he started passing out ?
no . ptsd patients
can slip into a disassociative fugue state .
it happens when they get agitated or perceive a threat .
they can become enraged , sometimes violent .
and when it &apos;s over , they have no recollection of what happened .
so it &apos;s possible graham killed his wife without even realizing it .
i &apos;d say it &apos;s more than possible .
don &apos;t do it . don &apos;t do it .
hey !
who are you ?
you &apos;re not a tourist .
i said who are you !
my name is steve mcgarrett . i &apos;m five @-@ o.
but before that i was a seal , just like you .
bud / s class 203 .
they send you in here to get me ?
no . i came in by myself .
i don &apos;t want anyone else involved
until we get a chance to talk straight , okay ?
you can tell me what really happened .
for your service ,
i thought you deserved at least that much .
i didn &apos;t kill my wife .
okay . i believe you , man .
we &apos;re trying to get to the bottom of that right now .
where is it ?
where &apos;s the knife ? where &apos;s the knife ?
wait . graham , graham , listen ,
nobody took your knife , all right ?
maybe you lost it . but you have the gun .
graham , you have a gun , that &apos;s right .
you &apos;re in control . everybody here knows that .
we all know who &apos;s in control here .
but you got to listen to me .
if you &apos;re telling me the truth ,
my team is going to find that out .
they &apos;re working the case as we speak ,
but you &apos;re not making it easy on us , graham ,
holding all these people here .
you know ? you got to do the right thing for yourself ,
for your daughter .
where &apos;s lily ?
my team has her . she &apos;s safe .
i promise you . you have my word .
let &apos;s just let a couple of folks go .
come on . you &apos;re a seal and your best tactical advice
is for me to let go of my only leverage ?
what are you talking about ? you got me .
take me instead .
i have you , too .
come on , graham . you got to give me something , man .
you got to show me a little good will .
at least @-@ at least let me check on this guy
before he bleeds out .
fine . clean him up .
empty your pockets and your purses .
don &apos;t do anything !
look at the bleeding here .
i got to stop it , i got no supplies .
i need some nail glue , a sewing kit , anything .
empty them !
don &apos;t try anything .
it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay .
all right , you messed him up pretty good , graham .
good news is , you didn &apos;t kill him .
i know .
if i wanted him dead , he &apos;d be dead .
hey , pretty ladies .
two biggies , on the house .
aw , thank you , uncle .
no problem . anything else , just holla .
okay .
that &apos;s yours .
this one &apos;s mine .
is it good ?
my favorite &apos;s grape .
you know why ?
makes my , uh , tongue purple . see ?
you don &apos;t like the lemon ?
daddy eats that part .
so , uh ... this one night at bud / s ?
me and a couple of the guys were , uh ,
were sneaking back onto base , right ?
and we hear this real mean , crusty ,
&quot; hey . you ladies ready to get wet and sandy ? &quot;
master chief white .
yes , sir .
bet he wasn &apos;t too happy , huh ?
are you kidding me ?
he was thrilled to catch us .
he gave us five extra hours of cold @-@ water conditioning .
we didn &apos;t get out of the water till dawn .
that &apos;s tough love for you .
so , graham , tell me about noreen .
where &apos;d you guys meet ?
germany .
six and a half years ago .
i was traveling through europe , on leave .
she was working at an all @-@ ranks club in ramstein .
she &apos;d just emigrated there with her daughter .
three months later we were married .
from russia , right ?
how did you know ?
i told you , my people are investigating .
well , she changed her name just before we moved to the states .
she didn &apos;t like the name irina anyway .
just wanted to put her past behind her , you know ,
start a new life .
and her daughter lily , she was , uh ,
she was from a previous marriage , right ?
yeah , lily &apos;s father died just before she was born .
lily ...
i can &apos;t imagine what she &apos;s going through .
graham , what happened this morning ?
we fought .
we argued .
i don &apos;t even know
what it was about .
i @-@ i know .
i haven &apos;t been easy to live with .
ever since i &apos;ve been back ,
you know , it &apos;s been difficult .
noreen says sometimes that she &apos;s scared of me ,
that i &apos;m not even the same guy that she married to .
but i was dealing with it .
i was getting better .
you know , the shrink says , you know , &quot; when you get worked up ,
just take two laps around the block .
you know , clear your head . &quot;
and that &apos;s what i did .
right , so you left the house .
and when i came back , there she was
in the middle of the living room .
and i tried to resuscitate her .
that &apos;s when the cops , they show up .
after all noreen and i had been through ,
i figured they &apos;d think i &apos;d hurt her .
got scared , i ran .
i &apos;d never hurt noreen .
and it means everything for lily to know
that i didn &apos;t do this to her mother .
i get it , graham .
whoa , whoa , whoa , what are you doing ? !
back !
you don &apos;t think i know what you &apos;re doing ?
relex , i &apos;m not doing anything .
huh ? we &apos;re done . let &apos;s go .
you &apos;re done playing nurse .
graham , this guy needs a cat scan .
he needs to get off the ship .
keep me , keep all these other people , but let this guy go .
prove to me , graham , prove to me that you &apos;re a good man .
all right .
hey , you &apos;re free to go .
go , get out of here .
all right , everybody else ,
we &apos;re moving out .
except you !
you &apos;re going in there .
ah , ah !
around .
i &apos;m not interested in playing any more of your head games .
get in .
close the door .
get back !
terrific .
where are you ?
the head .
graham barricaded me in here .
you &apos;re in a bathroom ?
i could &apos;ve gotten locked into a bathroom .
it &apos;s a long story .
okay , i &apos;m calling swat .
no , you won &apos;t call swat . i &apos;ll find a way out of here .
just tell me , what do you got ?
okay .
graham &apos;s psychiatrist said
that he &apos;s been experiencing blackouts ,
which means that he may have killed his wife
without even realizing it .
no , it doesn &apos;t make sense .
how does that not make sense ?
how does that not make sense to you ?
i mean , the guy fled the crime scene
with the murder weapon in his hand .
huh ? i mean , i am no detective--
wait a minute . where am i ?
oh , i &apos;m a detective !
he is still our prime suspect !
graham identified me as a threat ,
and he didn &apos;t do anything , okay ?
he could have killed me , but he didn &apos;t .
okay , all right , listen .
i know this guy is a seal , all right ?
and brothers @-@ in @-@ arms , the whole thing-- i get that .
all right , but that does not mean he didn &apos;t kill his wife .
you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re right ,
but i promised him that we would investigate this murder .
what do you think i &apos;m doing ?
i am investigating .
unfortunately , he is our only suspect .
in my experience , when you only have one suspect ,
he &apos;s usually the one that you put in jail !
okay , you want me to broaden the search , fine ,
but you &apos;re gonna have to give me something else .
as a matter of fact , i actually might have a new lead .
graham said that noreen was a russian citizen ,
they moved here six years ago .
all right , that &apos;ll explain why she has no record prior to &apos; 04 .
right .
and she changed her identity before they came here .
her first name is irina . so dig deeper .
you know what ? maybe that manuscript you found can help .
okay , well , i already sent that over
to your friend catherine in intelligence ,
and she said we &apos;ll have a translation back in an hour .
oh , and the key-- i got a match
to a safe deposit box , first hawaiian bank .
they &apos;re sending the contents over right now .
what was that ? what the hell was that ?
danny , i &apos;ll call you back .
i figured you &apos;d want your things back .
how &apos;d you get past graham without him seeing you ?
well , i know things about this ship that aren &apos;t on your map .
i thought i told you to stay put .
hmm ? i &apos;m an old man .
i don &apos;t always hear so good .
don &apos;t shoot ! don &apos;t shoot !
i &apos;m a hostage !
he let me go !
i need help !
you get him ,
i keep the seal .
and nobody else is leaving until
you find out who killed noreen .
let me speak with mcgarrett .
all you need to know is that he &apos;s still alive .
and i &apos;m watching you .
you got less than two hours .
and if you pull another stunt like that ,
the next hostage comes out in a body bag .
you had that fellow &apos;s knife and you were standing
right next to him and you didn &apos;t take him out ?
there &apos;s a way to do this where nobody has to die .
besides , this is evidence .
look at the dried blood on this knife .
there &apos;s a fingerprint in there .
i think it was put there at the time of the murder .
watch this .
this could be what clears him .
you really think he &apos;s innocent , don &apos;t you ?
my team &apos;s motto is &quot; leave no man behind . &quot;
now we just need to find him .
where do you think he took the hostages ?
he &apos;s gonna need another place with a good view of the gangway .
i think the best place would be the pilothouse .
well , i know a shortcut .
lead the way .
took me a while ,
but i swore that i knew the name steve mcgarrett .
your grandfather was in the navy , wasn &apos;t he ?
yes , sir . stationed here at pearl .
yeah .
i remember .
wait a minute .
tough son of a gun .
you served with my grandfather ?
on the arizona .
you were one of the lucky ones .
it wasn &apos;t luck .
i wasn &apos;t onboard that day .
i lied about my age to enlist , you know .
i was 16 at the time .
they found out , but the officers liked me ,
and they kept me around as a runner .
so that &apos;s what i was doing
december 7 , 1941 .
running messages to the army at fort shafter across the harbor .
i could see those explosions .
those men i admired so greatly .
oh , they gave their lives for all of us .
and i couldn &apos;t do a damn thing for them .
i walk past that arizona memorial every day ,
and i am reminded of their sacrifice .
the man that you are named after was a real hero .
you should be very proud .
i am proud .
come on . let &apos;s go .
what are you drawing ?
me , mommy and daddy .
what are you drawing ?
this is me , surfing this morning .
can you draw what you were doing this morning ?
okay .
what is that ?
it &apos;s my hiding place .
for when there &apos;s too much yelling .
you hide under the couch ?
sometimes .
are those daddy &apos;s shoes ?
no .
whose shoes are they ?
hey , you don &apos;t have to be afraid .
nothing &apos;s gonna happen to you .
you can tell me .
that &apos;s the man that yelled at mommy .
was daddy there when they were yelling ?
okay , lily , this is really important .
who was that man ?
and what was he saying to mommy ?
i can &apos;t talk funny like him and mommy did .
but they yelled .
a lot .
then mommy got hurt .
hey , do you want to , do you want to see where i work ?
lily , who is that ?
who is that man ?
excuse me . sir .
excuse me . sir . sir .
lily ! lily ! lily !
stop !
i only took my eyes off lily , like , for a second .
they were targeting her .
we didn &apos;t know that .
there was nothing you could &apos;ve done to prevent it .
so i got an apb out on the vehicle .
uh , hpd &apos;s setting up checkpoints .
we got no plates , but kono got eyes on the abductors .
she okay ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
did you get any hits on those fingerprints i sent you ?
yeah . um , i got a second set on the knife ,
and they definitely don &apos;t belong to graham .
and they don &apos;t belong to noreen , either .
but , uh , they &apos;re not showing up in any hpd database ,
so i &apos;m expanding the search nationally .
great , so , uh , we &apos;ve got abductors ,
we &apos;ve got a witness that puts another man
in the house at the time of the murder ,
and we got somebody else &apos;s prints on the blade .
you know what , danny ? this is really starting to look like ...
graham didn &apos;t do it . i know .
but it &apos;s not over yet .
we need to find a match on that print , danny .
you need to end this hostage situation .
and whatever you do , please ,
under no circumstance
tell this guy about his daughter .
he should know .
no , no . he shouldn &apos;t know . he shouldn &apos;t know .
trust me-- as a father , the last thing you want
to hear about is that something happened to your kid .
and you add that to his irrational state of mind ,
things are only going to get worse .
copy that .
don &apos;t , uh ...
don &apos;t get soft on this guy , partner , all right ?
not until we have absolute proof that he didn &apos;t kill his wife .
and if he did , and it comes down to it ,
you going to be able to take this guy out ?
it &apos;s not going to come to that .
quiet !
graham , it &apos;s mcgarrett .
we need to talk .
i should have figured you &apos;d get out .
listen , i believe you .
i don &apos;t think you killed your wife .
okay ?
and with a little more time ,
my team is going to be able to prove that , graham .
how ?
let &apos;s free those people , so we can talk .
you &apos;re lying !
i need my pack .
this has been going on too long .
i &apos;m going to end it now .
we found noreen &apos;s passport
in her safe deposit box .
she was born irina tarasova
in st. petersburg , russia , 1979 .
catherine also just sent over the translation .
the manuscript you found at the house--
it was noreen &apos;s journal .
uh , most of it &apos;s about her life in russia .
she was married to , uh , a banker ,
and it sounded like it was pretty brutal .
multiple accounts of domestic violence .
we got an i.d. on him , too .
yegor chubais .
vice president of donvaya bank in switzerland .
he filed a report saying his wife
and newborn child went missing on a trip abroad .
that &apos;s him .
that &apos;s who ?
that &apos;s the guy that kidnapped lily .
chubais came into hawaii three days ago .
he &apos;s chartered a plane to moscow .
it leaves in an hour .
he &apos;s trying to flee with lily .
that &apos;s why he comes to hawaii .
she starts a new life to get away from him .
somehow , he finds out where she is .
and when noreen wouldn &apos;t come with him ...
son of a bitch kills the mother of his own daughter .
can &apos;t let them get on that plane . come on .
okay , come on , everybody !
let &apos;s get moving ! come on !
don &apos;t you move .
mcgarrett &apos;s not answering .

yegor &apos;s dead .
noreen told me that he had died of cancer .
why would she lie to me ?
