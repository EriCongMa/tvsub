max , your boyfriend is naked
and waving from the dumpster he calls his apartment .
make sure it &apos;s deke .
last time you said that , i went over ,
and it was just a naked meth head in a normal dumpster .
i mean , we had a blast , but still .
well , at least that meth head bought a bunch of cupcakes .
i mean , he thought they were alive ,
but he bought them .
hey , i &apos;m gonna cut out early .
you &apos;re sleeping over again ?
seriously , max , sleeping in a dumpster ?
are you trying to bring sars back ?
well , i did bring it in the first time ,
and that is the last time i hook up
with a bat in thailand .
hey , max .
max is 45 minutes late .
and she better not say she have a prostate exam
&apos;cause i &apos;m not falling for that again .
relax , she &apos;s just down the street at deke &apos;s place .
you know how it is when you first start sleeping with somebody ,
and you can &apos;t keep your hands off each other .
yeah , just take my word for it .
i know i couldn &apos;t keep my hands off my first love .
i &apos;m talking , of course , about my penis .
i &apos;ve had enough !
you two girls walk all over me .
a baby can walk all over you .
hi , everybody .
i just heard two hobos getting freaky in the garbage .
sophie , that was max and deke .
oh , i get it .
you gotta do crazy things to keep it fresh .
you know , i once had sex on a bus ,
and i was driving it .
boy , were those kids late to school .
that &apos;s it , i am marching over there
and putting my foot down with max .
no one has sex on my clock .
well , maybe your clock &apos;s not big enough .
that &apos;s it . no more free jell @-@ o .
max !
max , open up .
i &apos;m very upset .
more upset than that time
you enrolled me in little league .
hey , it was your decision to play the full season .
oh , goody , i was hoping for some hecklers at this ,
my lowest moment .
hey , if the dumpster &apos;s rockin &apos; ,
&quot; 如果屋里正在摇滚 &#91; 晃动 &#93; 就不用费心敲门了 &quot;
don &apos;t bother knockin &apos; , baby .
hey , man .
hello , little girl .
i &apos;ll take three boxes of samoas and a thin mints .
don &apos;t forget my tagalongs .
they &apos;re called peanut butter patties now .
why must i be that person ?
what up , fools ?
hey , girl .
max , you &apos;re 48 minutes late for work .
look , little debbie ,
we &apos;re in here preparing for
a big pastry school competition tomorrow .
and having sex .
and if you ever interrupt me while i am studying ...
and having sex .
again , i will dropkick your baby @-@ powdered ass
back to the shire with the other hobbits .
i told her .
did you ?
all flowers must be set on top of the cakes
by the time we call &quot; time . &quot;
everyone , final touches .
that &apos;s what i used to say
when i finished my shift at hooters .
制服十分曝露
hot . you still got that uniform ?
oh , not sure it &apos;d fit me anymore .
i used to have really big boobs .
bebe , how much time is there left ?
for all of us ?
oh , oh , gosh , i &apos;d say two months , tops .
no , no , for the cake competition .
oh , 60 seconds .
only 60 seconds ? come on !
i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t handle this pressure .
it &apos;s only a matter of time
before i start eating my eyelashes again .
the winning team will earn a free week of class .
and also--how do you say-- bragging rights .
hurry !
move faster , lindsay slow @-@ hands .
forget about it , big mary .
these competition is ours .
deke and i are broke . we need this more than you .
15 seconds !
bonjour , caroline .
this is a real treat .
don &apos;t do that . you &apos;re married .
i &apos;m only here in an official capacity .
bebe &apos;s in an emotional ball in the hall .
ten seconds !
come on , girl .
bring it home , bring it home !
i am way too excited about this .
okay , everybody .
i see a clear favorite here .
but , caroline , in truth ,
if i were to pick the prettiest flower in the room ,
i &apos;d pick you .
that is ... incredibly obvious
and incredibly accurate .
oh , come on ! get a stairwell !
your timer .
merci .
just tell us who won .
the winners are , i am very happy to say ...
max and deke .
you were amazing ! i love you .
i love you too .
wait , you do ?
do you ?
yeah ... i do .
yeah , well , i do too ,
so suck on that .
okay , two important things .
one , i &apos;m the guy you &apos;ve been talking to on okcupid .
and two , i need five minutes of girl talk
and not a minute more
because i &apos;m worried it &apos;ll turn me into a girl .
go . tell me .
leave nothing out , leave everything in .
i said something today i never thought i &apos;d say .
&quot; thank you &quot; ?
i said &quot; i love you &quot; to deke .
he said , &quot; i love you , &quot; and i said it back .
oh , cool . good for you .
wait , that &apos;s it ?
i finally decide to cave and be a girl for you ,
and you hang me out to dry ?
i &apos;ve seen movies .
you &apos;re supposed to jump around and say ,
&quot; this calls for a margarita ! &quot;
this calls for a margarita !
too much , too late .
your first reaction said everything ,
and your second one was just annoying .
i &apos;m sorry , i just didn &apos;t think
you were taking him so seriously .
he has no money .
i mean , the man lives in a dumpster .
you are such a snob .
it doesn &apos;t bother you he has to move his house
every tuesday between 10 : 00 and 2 : 00 ?
no , i &apos;ve always wanted to travel .
come on , you can &apos;t really be in love with him , right ?
i mean , you can &apos;t love deke .
max , you &apos;re in love with that cute mochaccino homeless guy
with the jew @-@ fro ?
he is not homeless .
he lives in a beautifully decorated dumpster .
so homeless ?
i get it .
you know , i used to be engaged
to a man who lived in the sewers .
yeah , the heart wants what it wants .
plus he told me he was friends
with the mutant ninja turtles ,
and they were a huge deal at the time .
at the time ?
if he can introduce me to donatello , get him back .
how did you know you loved this ... sewer man ?
well , he made me laugh .
he was very passionate ,
and i wanted to be with him constantly .
probably because he got me hooked on heroin .
that was a crazy summer .
see ? i feel the same way .
minus the heroin part , unfortunately .
can i use your bathroom ?
i have to tinkle , and there &apos;s a wasp in mine .
go ahead , sophie .
what &apos;s that look ?
is the wasp behind me ?
i can &apos;t believe you .
even after three years of being friends with me ,
you still have a thing against poor people .
max , you love him , i can love him .
i just have to get to know him better .
invite me over to the garbage can
for a wine and cheese party .
wait a minute . wine and cheese party ?
oh , i &apos;m gonna bring my new boy toy .
he &apos;s the caesar salad pepperer at the olive garden .
no dates , sophie .
the place is so small ,
i once accidentally took it home in my purse .
this camembert smells like feet ,
so you know it &apos;s good .
look at you , mayor mccheese .
so fancy .
it &apos;s just the usual diner crew , you know .
we serve imitation imitation crab .
well , i just wanted to class the place up for you .
you know , get some wine , get some cheese , flush .
you did not need to do that .
i love that you live here .
and if a dumpster was good enough for me as a baby ,
it is still good enough for me as an adult .
oh , you love that i live here .
do you love anything else ?
well , i loved the karate kid movies
由威尔 · 史密斯的儿子与成龙主演 评价一般
until will smith &apos;s kid ruined them .
okay , can we please be serious for a minute ?
did you just say &quot; i love you &quot; because i said it first ?
look , honestly , yes .
but i definitely meant it , i think .
look , i suck at this stuff .
this and not laughing when kids fall .
just know that if / when i say it again ,
i will mean it .
i can totally wait-- i love you , max .
nice try , sneaky .
oh , hi . come on in .
and be nice . remember , you barely have a bed .
don &apos;t worry . i love this area .
i met your neighbor , the mattress .
oh , that queen ?
so would you like a cabernet or a shiraz ?
shiraz .
oh , that &apos;s a real name ?
some interesting pairings here .
in fact , i &apos;m looking at one as we speak .
please , someone else come right now .
hi , everyone !
i &apos;m here .
please , someone else come right now .
i brought some homemade kimchi bin dae duk .
would you like to try it ,
or should i just throw it right into the garbage ?
it took me a year to get this kind of smell out of here ,
but thanks , han .
oh , what a dump .
i thought of that on the way over .
all right , let &apos;s do this .
i &apos;m ready to rage all night , baby .
oh , hell no .
i am too old for this .
sophie , watch your head .
you might wanna take your heels off .
take my heels off ?
communist russia couldn &apos;t get me to take my heels off .
hey , earl , you wanna go get drunk somewhere
we don &apos;t have to bend over till we want to ?
indeed , i do .
not to brag , but i &apos;m the only one
who can stand up in here .
cool brag , han .
so , deke , tell me about yourself .
hey , stop guantanamo bay @-@ ing him .
well , i go to pastry school ,
i live in a dumpster ,
and i was thrown out of one direction
for being too handsome .
that &apos;s about it .
there must be more to you than that .
i mean , i &apos;m surprised to see
a roquefort cheese paired with a 2001 syrah
from the rhone region of france at a dumpster party .
where &apos;d you learn about wine ?
well , i wanted to impress you ,
and i keep my adult grape juice game on point .
so where are you from originally ?
did you grow up in a storage facility or--
will you stop ?
he looks nervous like the fat guy at a birthday party
when he finds out there &apos;s a pool .
coming , coming .
good . we have the right dumpster .
i brought some wine . bebe brought cheese .
kind of .
hey , guys , thanks for inviting me .
happy to be included .
all right , another babe .
throw your keys in the bowl .
right now , it &apos;s just me and han , and ...
that ain &apos;t happening .
what is nicolas doing here ? hide me .
i think you &apos;re gonna run into him .
sorry , i thought you were into him .
i &apos;m not into him .
please , caroline , relax .
it &apos;s just a party . i &apos;m here as a friend .
then where is your hand ?
on your beautiful bottom .
sorry , it &apos;s crowded .
it was either there or in the sink .
please remove it .
i @-@ i did .
that one &apos;s mine , baby .
come on , it &apos;s 8 : 45,
and nobody &apos;s got their tops off .
somebody &apos;s gotta do something .
oh , one time i played seven minutes in heaven .
规则是把一男一女关进衣柜 7分钟内做什么事都可以
well , i got hit by a bus ,
and i was dead for seven minutes .
bebe , do you want some wine ?
sure , why not ?
i don &apos;t have anything to do tomorrow
except move to canada .
what ?
yeah , no biggie .
long story short ,
they found me .
caroline , looks like it &apos;s gonna be just
you and me in the office .
nicolas , please .
what did i tell you about your hand ?
that &apos;s me !
i was trying to push my way to the cheese .
hey , bebe gun , if you &apos;re ever in alberta ,
hit the fairmont at banff-- super fun .
i got wasted and cannonballed into the lake there once .
it was frozen . shattered my pelvis .
good times .
hey , i know that place .
fairmont chateau on lake louise ?
we used to winter there .
that &apos;s a really exclusive resort .
i once saw them tell barbra streisand
to take it to the holiday inn .
caroline , you want some of my triple creme ?
i don &apos;t want any of your creme .
you know what , it &apos;s getting a little crowded in here .
i &apos;m just gonna slip out without anyone noticing .
oh , excuse me .
excuse me , excuse me , excuse me .
wait , wait , wait . wait , wait , wait , wait .
so ...
deke--what do you think ? do you like him now ?
well , before tonight ,
i thought he was the guy who walks around
singing &quot; when you &apos;re sliding into home
and your shorts are full of foam , diarrhea . &quot;
now i find out he knows all about cheese
and has been to this massively expensive resort ,
so i &apos;m even more confused .
what &apos;s confusing ?
the foam is diarrhea .
caroline , wait .
let me walk with you .
no , no , no . i &apos;m good .
please , at least take my scarf . it &apos;s cold .
no , i &apos;m fine--
are you okay ? here , let me help .
no , nicolas .
i am not going to be the other woman .
despite the fact that i am literally lying in trash ,
i am not trashy .
caroline , listen .
things aren &apos;t always what they seem .
just because that is garbage on the outside
doesn &apos;t mean that it cannot be
a nice apartment on the inside .
just because i &apos;m married on the outside
doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m married on the inside .
life is complex .
your whole thesis is hinged on the fact
that i think that dumpster is nice on the inside ,
which i don &apos;t . good night .
oh , caroline--
nicolas , please don &apos;t beg .
i just--
maybe another world , another life .
i want--
you can &apos;t leave your wife for me .
no , it &apos;s just--
seriously ! you don &apos;t have to say it .
no , i do .
you have a diaper on your back .
i am aware .
what are you working on there ?
is that a family having a picnic at a park ?
no , it &apos;s the letter &quot; g &quot; !
i haven &apos;t written anything by hand since 1996 .
well , my writing &apos;s really good .
i forge a lot of checks and prescriptions .
i &apos;m kind of a famous doctor .
you &apos;re really saying it .
that says , &quot; i love you . &quot;
no , it &apos;s khloe kardashian windsurfing .
yes , deke , i love you .
oh , bebe .
i wasn &apos;t expecting you today . i thought you moved .
i &apos;m on my way . my car &apos;s outside ,
but i remembered i left my medication here .
okay , now where &apos;s the big one ?
well , as long as you &apos;re here ,
could you show me where the student financial files are ?
sure , they &apos;re here in this folder
i &apos;ve labeled &quot; depressing . &quot;
i wanna check deke &apos;s file and see if he &apos;s on scholarship .
he &apos;s definitely not on scholarship .
his family &apos;s super rich . he &apos;s a bromberg .
wait , bebe . bromberg ?
i thought deke &apos;s last name was just &quot; berg . &quot;
as in &quot; ice &quot; or &quot; pitts . &quot;
no , he just goes by berg for short .
you know , like me , my full name is bebebebe .
so you &apos;re telling me deke is from the bromberg family ,
as in the bromberg elevators--
the ones that are in every building in the city ?
as in the bromberg colo @-@ rectal center
at the new york hospital ?
yeah .
you know , i once left a purse
and 2 feet of my large intestine there .
nice knowing you . bye .
ooh , i &apos;ll be right back .
if you mess up our batter ,
i &apos;ll cut your thing off .
sweet , i could stand to lose 5 pounds .
i have some exciting news to share .
unless it &apos;s about an off @-@ season shamrock shake ,
i don &apos;t care .
your deke--dumpster deke--
is actually deacon bromberg .
of the manhattan brombergs ! he &apos;s rich !
what are you talking about ? that is crazy .
i would know if he were rich .
i wouldn &apos;t have just told a rich guy i love him .
it &apos;s all right here . isn &apos;t this amazing ?
this is like buying a dress you love
and finding out it &apos;s rich .
whoa , why &apos;d you do that ?
you &apos;re rich .
max , wait .
you pretended to be poor . liar .
ooh , lordy be .
this kind of drama &apos;s the reason
why i quit the ohio state football team .
why are you so upset ?
lying about being rich is at most a little white lie .
it is literally the whitest lie i have ever heard ,
and it &apos;s a huge deal .
i never would have fallen in love with someone who has money .
we are drastically , massively ,
monumentally different people .
hey , max , can we talk ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
depends on who i &apos;m talking to .
am i talking to deke or deacon bromberg ,
the elevator king ?
man , if you &apos;re this upset about the money ,
how are you gonna react when you find out
i &apos;m really a woman ?
we wouldn &apos;t care .
i never tell anybody i &apos;m rich
until after we say i love you
because i don &apos;t want money to change anything .
money changes everything !
now excuse me .
i gotta do my second job ,
which you wouldn &apos;t know anything about .
don &apos;t you have an ascot convention to get to ?
still here .
also , two customers just showed up .
we don &apos;t need their money !
we &apos;re big , fat liars pretending to be poor too .
mm , yeah , my mom invented dogs .
any time someone buys a dog , we get 10 % !
now i can &apos;t believe it .
even after three years with me as a friend ,
you still have a thing against rich people .
i do , because rich people suck .
they think they &apos;re better than everyone
and are generally sucky .
so he has money , i don &apos;t want it .
again , just wildly different people .
and , max , just because he &apos;s rich on the outside
doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s not like you on the inside .
life is complex .
i don &apos;t wanna see you right now !
hey ! i don &apos;t wanna see you either .
just toss me something chocolate
with some cream in the middle .
and speaking of cream in the middle ,
your little homeless boyfriend is trying to get your attention .
he &apos;s not homeless . he &apos;s not my boyfriend .
he &apos;s rich .
rich ? and he &apos;s single ?
oh , maybe i will take off my heels .
