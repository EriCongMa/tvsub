the body is an infinitely complex mass of interacting systems .
people like to think doctors see it all clearly .
but it &apos;s not always obvious what &apos;s a hiccup in the system ,
and what &apos;s a full on medical disaster .
we figure that out in our first year of residency .
hey , you sleep okay ?
great .
we spend the rest of our careers lying about it .
i probably can &apos;t write about this in the article ,
but something about how my toothpaste
hit the sink made me realize that
the array could be designed asymmetrically .
makes it more versatile .
exactly .
so what you &apos;re saying is that you can &apos;t spit
without having a genius idea .
well , it may not work .
zola , are your socks on ?
it was a revolutionary glob of spit .
so if you need anything ,
just call me and--
no , i don &apos;t need anything .
i just need to read everything
that was ever written on the mediastinal teratomas
and crank out a grant proposal .
all i need is quiet .
well , i can &apos;t promise you too much quiet
because you did say that i could come visit .
i did say that .
yeah .
oh , that &apos;s the best part of my day .
hey , welcome back .
hey , thanks .
beats the hell out of a courtroom .
you know , she brought muffins .
it &apos;s her day off . she &apos;s doing homework .
in a hospital ?
yeah . god .
get some air . see the world , right ?
i think it &apos;s sweet .
it &apos;s adorable .
dr. webber &apos;s bugging me for another stress test .
oh , he failed the last one two minutes in .
i know , but he &apos;s been practicing .
as soon as i get a minute i &apos;ll go check on him again .
hi .
you &apos;re on my service again ?
i &apos;m sorry .
as soon as i change ,
i wanna go through the computer model again
before we start printing the vein .
i &apos;m sorry . before you do that ,
you &apos;re gonna have to go check on your pancreas lady ,
donna kaufman . not good .
we were hoping we could remove the tumor ,
but it &apos;s advanced further than we initially thought .
the best course of action would be
to relieve your obstruction and block the nerves in the area .
that should help with the pain .
you &apos;re not even gonna try ?
victor .
i &apos;m sorry .
i ... wish there was more that we could do .
dealing with the pain is a lot better than nothing .
let &apos;s do that .
okay .
okay .
sooner is better .
we &apos;ve been treating him with diuretics and beta blockers ,
but he &apos;s still got a lot of edema .
he &apos;ll rally once we put in the graft .
then we can get him out of here .
poor kid &apos;s been here for almost three weeks .
you done with all the test prints ?
yeah , uh , we finished them last night .
shane &apos;s printing out the real one now .
emma &apos;s here ...
with muffins .
owen &apos;s chick ? you wanna get rid of her ?
no .
i &apos;m ... glad he &apos;s ... getting laid .
you know , everyone should be getting laid .
i should be getting laid .
oh , here we go again .
my work suffers when i &apos;m not . it &apos;s bad for humanity .
all right , can you make up with mer
so i don &apos;t have to talk to you about sex ?
why are you being such a priss ?
don &apos;t you talk to your guy friends about sex ?
who ? avery ? no .
well , you don &apos;t talk about
who &apos;s got the best rack in the shack ?
maybe .
so you can do it with me .
okay , fine . your work &apos;s suffering so bad ,
then , um , find something to play with .
get your yayas out and leave me alone .
what like ... battery @-@ operated ?
no , human .
a human sex toy ?
you asked .
how long you been there ?
somewhere around &quot; yayas . &quot;
that &apos;s great .
we have a problem .
our conduit &apos;s contaminated .
how the hell did that happen ?
i don &apos;t know .
i can print another one and try vacuum seeding ,
but it &apos;ll take longer .
we won &apos;t be able to do the procedure today .
i don &apos;t know if this kid can hang on for one more day .
we gotta try , right ? it &apos;s still his best shot .
i &apos;ll talk to karev .
dr. grey &apos;s supposed to have the printer by 10 : 00 a.m. today .
we made the schedule and made a big stink
about how she had to stick to it .
edwards ! hey ! uh , can you write down
your mailing address for me ?
sure .
i &apos;m sending you an invitation to my wedding .
thought about doing them online .
it &apos;s better for the environment , i know .
but i just couldn &apos;t deal with an evite to my wedding .
great ! i really hope you &apos;ll come .
and , um , obviously , you can also , like ,
bring a guest .
his b.p. &apos; s in the toilet .
if this procedure &apos;s not ready ,
you gotta come up with something else .
it &apos;s one day .
can you relax ? god , maybe you &apos;re the one
who needs a little recreational energy release .
i &apos;m getting laid , regularly .
so all my anxiety is based on the fact
that you brought me on this case
and asked me to keep a kid alive long enough for you
to do a fancy procedure that &apos;s not gonna work .
all right , maybe it &apos;s nothing .
but maybe it &apos;s worth having a conversation
with somebody in psych .
oh , you &apos;re making a mountain out of it .
look , it can &apos;t hurt !
look , hell , i &apos;d like to have a sit @-@ down with somebody
and talk a couple things out every now and then .
well , then you go . i have a busy schedule .
navel gazing is not on it .
that &apos;s my point .
overloading your schedule can exacerbate
the kind of behaviors you &apos;ve been--
i &apos;m not having behaviors ! i &apos;m having a life .
like you used to have
when you were pursuing something that challenged you .
bailey , you have time for an ex @-@ lap ?
i got a burn patient with a surgical abdomen .
absolutely .
trauma two !
what do we got ?
ella holmes , 6 , hit by a car ,
tachycardic and hypotensive .
she was on her scooter .
she knows she &apos;s not supposed to ride it down the hill .
i don &apos;t know what happened .
show me the ultrasound .
is she gonna be okay ?
are you her mom ?
they &apos;re out of town .
intraperitoneal free fluid .
call c.t. and book an o.r. just in case .
dr. robbins ?
she &apos;s got a supracondylar femur fracture .
okay , call torres .
is that gonna be okay ?
yeah , we &apos;re on the mend .
i &apos;m glad to hear it .
murphy , go with torres and robbins .
it &apos;s not a good idea .
it &apos;ll be fine .
i don &apos;t think--
murphy !
pressure &apos;s dropping !
what is that ?
i can &apos;t wait for a c.t. prep her for the o.r.
i have to call her parents . what am i supposed to tell them ?
i &apos;ll update you as soon as we know .
all right , let &apos;s move , people .
let &apos;s go .
but is--is everything going to be okay ?
it &apos;s all going to be fine .
&quot; somebody that i used to know &quot;
can you pull that lap pad out
and see if there &apos;s any bleeding ?
slowly .
i don &apos;t see anything .
good .
dr. torres is gonna fix the femur ?
yeah , but she &apos;ll need some help so you should stick around .
well , you &apos;ll help her , right ?
i mean , you don &apos;t think she needs two people .
you &apos;re a resident .
you &apos;re supposed to beg to be in that room .
i &apos;m sorry if it &apos;s awkward .
i hope that it doesn &apos;t have to be .
you two are definitely getting back together ?
we are .
like you &apos;re trying it out or like ...
yeah .
you don &apos;t wanna be the person who says , &quot; i &apos;ll wait for you
in case it doesn &apos;t work out with your wife . &quot;
so you &apos;re trying to find a woman for him
to be with once you &apos;ve passed .
i know it sounds strange .
but i don &apos;t want him to be alone .
and if he &apos;s on his own , i don &apos;t think he &apos;ll do it .
it &apos;s certainly unusual , but i understand .
you love your husband .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s not my husband .
i mean , i love my husband .
but this is for someone else--stan .
he &apos;s a very special friend .
donna , i &apos;m gonna need to get at that left arm .
yeah , it &apos;s a lot more versatile .
well , it &apos;s an improvement , no question .
maybe if you have time over lunch ,
you can look over the proposal .
i wish i could .
got to get back to surgeries .
how &apos;s it feel to be back in the anesthesia game ?
it &apos;s fine .
not ideal , but , you know , got a family .
you make compromises .
yeah , meredith is gonna kill me .
what ? she doesn &apos;t like an asymmetrical array ?
i &apos;m supposed to be downshifting ,
and she &apos;s supposed to be upshifting .
ah , and yet you find inspiration in toothpaste .
maybe next time , you keep it to yourself .
that works for you ?
in a marriage ? yes . you keep your mouth shut .
although , uh , kinda ... miranda &apos;s been , uh ,
kind of struggling lately .
she has what , uh , if you squint real hard
looks a lot like o.c.d.
bailey ?
yeah , she had that incident with the hole in the gloves .
i knew it freaked her out , but i was away .
i didn &apos;t know how much it freaked her out .
you really think it &apos;s o.c.d. ?
i don &apos;t know .
i wanted to let her deal with it her way ,
but i &apos;m not sure she &apos;s dealing with it .
we were in the o.r. the other day ,
she kept the patient under easily an extra hour .
ben--
she went past that .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m not sure--
no , i know , i know . i should stay out of it .
but when i &apos;m watching a surgeon perform
what looks like unnecessary procedures--
i am on the board of this hospital .
i can &apos;t hear about a physician &apos;s misconduct and not report it .
i think you telling dr. grey is gonna go over better than--
no , i don &apos;t have time to manage her feelings right now .
just apologize , we feel terrible ,
it won &apos;t happen again .
she &apos;ll be pissy , but she &apos;ll get over it .
well , i could have edwards tell her .
she &apos;s on her service .
even better .
if you ever need any ... yaya extraction ...
getting the yayas out ...
i &apos;m available .
are you offering to service me ?
sorry . it was inappropriate .
it &apos;s just , you know , for the sake of the work .
that &apos;s even worse .
you &apos;re supposed to claim
that you &apos;re in love with me or something .
well , i certainly find you attractive .
there &apos;s no question . i mean ,
i wouldn &apos;t be so presumptuous as to assume--
stop talking .
it &apos;s ...
good .
hey , are those left over from the morning meeting ?
unh @-@ unh , she baked them .
you &apos;re kidding . i kind of hate you .
yeah , i kinda hate me , too .
hmm . if she &apos;s cooking your thanksgiving dinner ,
i want the leftovers .
oh , i &apos;m not--
oh , we &apos;re not--
well , i mean ... we could .
no , you don &apos;t have to say that .
i @-@ i hadn &apos;t given it much thought so ...
sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to open a can of worms .
i just--i mean , you could do what we do at my house ,
which is act like it &apos;s not even happening .
so you &apos;re--you &apos;re not going home to your family , or ...
i &apos;m on call the next day .
oh . well , we could do something .
oh , they &apos;re painting my apartment next week .
and we can &apos;t really cook in the trailer .
why not ? we could just eat outdoors , and ...
in november ?
yeah .
you could cook at my house .
you &apos;d have to feed us , too , but ...
that could be fun .
i don &apos;t wanna commandeer your kitchen .
oh , please . someone should .
they made those construction paper turkeys
at zola &apos;s school , and she had no idea
what they were talking about .
you &apos;d make me look like a better mother .
think about it .
pancreatic tumor . gotta go .
thanks .
welcome .
do you have donna &apos;s pre @-@ op labs ?
in process .
i &apos;m gonna go examine dr. webber .
and when i get back ,
we &apos;re gonna get started on the printer .
is that okay with you ?
yeah .
what was that about ?
i got her kicked off her own surgery a few days ago .
alex told me . ballsy .
stupid .
did kepner invite you to her wedding ?
no .
so she didn &apos;t ask you for your address ?
no , but i &apos;m sure alex is invited .
i &apos;m probably the plus one .
hey , dr. yang needs the printer again today .
uh , no .
one day . tell grey we &apos;re sorry .
no , you--you tell her .
can &apos;t .
gotta get the printer going so we only take one day
away from you , not two .
shane--
dying baby waiting on a part .
no--
get back here !
i &apos;m a waste of a bed .
your stress test was a disaster .
you want me to dwell on all your past failures ?
i &apos;m a different man than i was last week .
i exercise .
i don &apos;t know why you don &apos;t think about
going into a rehab facility .
we can get you in there even if you don &apos;t pass .
look , i don &apos;t want to go to a facility .
it &apos;s bad enough i &apos;m here ...
where everyone knows me ... and has to be nice .
well , you can &apos;t go home alone .
i &apos;ll get a home health aide .
i &apos;ll have wilson run another stress test .
you watch . flying colors .
you know , if you get out of here in time ,
you can have thanksgiving dinner at our house
if you and catherine don &apos;t have plans .
you cookin &apos; ?
is that so preposterous ?
you want a straight answer ?
no , owen &apos;s girlfriend is cooking .
does she put mushrooms in her stuffing ?
i find it makes it soggy .
you done already ?
no , she was too edematous .
we packed her and put in a temporary closure .
you can do her femur tomorrow after we close .
okay .
i wanna talk to you about something .
i was with someone when we were apart .
i don &apos;t think that it was completely out @-@ of @-@ bounds .
we were separated , and you &apos;d kicked me out of the house .
oh , so it &apos;s my fault ?
there are no faults . i just ... feel like you should know .
we &apos;re starting fresh , and ...
i wanna be honest with you . i ...
i shouldn &apos;t have said anything .
no , no .
i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re right .
thank you for ...
being so very honest .
i &apos;m trying .
is there anything that you wanna ask me ?
no .
i don &apos;t know . was it ..
was it once ?
it was more than once .
more than twice ?
more than ten ? you know what ? i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t wanna know anything about it .
i &apos;m sorry .
is it over ?
yes . completely .
okay .
that &apos;s all i need to know .
you didn &apos;t ?
what ?
cheat on you ?
get involved with anyone .
i got involved with myself .
i ... danced in my underwear ,
and i tried to remember
that i used to be a person who had fun .
i &apos;m really trying . callie , please ...
tell me that you &apos;re trying , too .
i am .
can i hug you ?
i really missed you .
me , too .
sorry .
ella &apos;s thigh is really swollen .
she &apos;s hypotensive .
all right , we gotta get her back in the o.r.
and , uh , do the femur right now .
um ... are ... you gonna help me ?
sure . will you give the family an update ?
they &apos;re on a ...
plane .
it &apos;s just the babysitter .
dr. grey .
i have to stop in post @-@ ops .
tell wilson to run a stress test on dr.webber--
they need the printer today-- dr. yang .
what ? no . sorry .
they said it &apos;s not up for discussion .
they &apos;re already running it .
i mean , i tried to talk to ross ,
but he said dr. yang isn &apos;t even interested in having--
nurses &apos; station .
we need to talk .
we really don &apos;t.- no , we do .
i have to wrap up a patient in the e.r. back here in 15 ?
okay .
yes . great .
dr. hunt ?
hey , so i invited dr.webber to thanksgiving ,
so now it really has to happen .
his lady is cooking thanksgiving dinner at our house .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
should we invite more people ?
well , uh , if we &apos;re making a whole turkey ,
we can--we can invite a few more .
okay , let &apos;s get dr.yang here , please .
you and bailey can come .
we &apos;re going to my family ,
assuming she &apos;s still speaking to me by then .
we should probably invite callie .
i &apos;m sure with the trial ,
i &apos;m sure she didn &apos;t have time to make plans .
so we &apos;re not inviting arizona . we can &apos;t have both .
well , they &apos;re back together , so ...
they are ?
hey , can you go do your thing
so we can get to our thing ?
yes .
so we &apos;re not inviting yang , right ?
because that wouldn &apos;t be ...
she probably has plans .
no , she probably doesn &apos;t .
do you have thanksgiving plans ?
what do you think ?
my house . 3 : 00 .
all right , i &apos;m bringing jo .
i figured .
don &apos;t sound so excited .
you know , you were an intern balling an attending once .
you kiss my kids with that mouth ?
i got a pre @-@ op . it &apos;ll be fast ,
but do not start with hunt until i get back .
i won &apos;t .
you don &apos;t wanna know .
i called dr.yang. she &apos;s not available right now .
does she know it &apos;s me who &apos;s asking for her ?
yes .
you okay ?
sure . i &apos;m going to update a patient &apos;s babysitter
instead of doing surgery .
because torres and robbins don &apos;t need me .
they have each other .
are the two of you ...
they &apos;re getting back together .
were you really into her or was it--
i was really into her . why do i do this ?
i can &apos;t keep falling apart at work every time i get dumped .
it &apos;s starting to be all the time .
so get off the floor . go talk to your babysitter
and get back in the o.r. like a surgeon would do .
oh , my vascular graft--
yeah , the one you printed ? i was gonna come and see it .
it had a glitch , so it &apos;ll be tomorrow , hopefully .
not today .
okay .
hey , you , uh , you have thanksgiving plans ?
well , i &apos;ll probably pick up an extra shift . you know ?
i don &apos;t get all that worked up about cranberries .
you ?
um ... well , uh , it &apos;s , um ...
evolving .
you can tell me you &apos;re spending it with emma .
i won &apos;t melt if i hear her name .
yes . i &apos;ll be with emma .
she gonna cook ?
hmm . well , watch out .
you let her make a turkey for just the two of you ,
you &apos;re gonna be eating leftovers for the rest of your life .
her ... femur was bleeding very heavily into her thigh ,
and ... she was in danger of losing too much blood .
oh , my god .
they &apos;ve taken her back into the o.r. ,
and they &apos;re working on her right now .
you told me it was just a broken leg .
well , a femur break can be complicated ,
but we &apos;re gonna take care of it .
oh , my god . they are gonna kill me .
i &apos;m sure that they won &apos;t .
i really liked them , too .
they work together . they &apos;re in alaska ,
studying the nesting habits of eagles .
i cannot believe i &apos;m gonna lose this job .
they &apos;re not gonna fire you .
they &apos;ll understand it wasn &apos;t your fault .
something terrible happened . you have to blame somebody .
what , are they gonna blame their child ?
they &apos;re probably never gonna let me see her again .
i guess it &apos;s my fault for getting so attached .
hey , can i boot you out of your o.r. at 4 : 00 ?
uh , the mastoidectomy after this ?
yeah .
i need to put a gastro @-@ j on the schedule .
and if i tell grey she can &apos;t get into the o.r. until 7 : 00,
she &apos;s gonna shove her hand into my chest
and rip out my heart with her claws .
that means i have to work late .
you &apos;ll be working late anyhow ,
because you &apos;re so committed to the welfare of this hospital .
and to the people who count on you for support .
all right , all right , i will take it .
thank you .
and kepner invited me to her wedding .
did she ?
plus one .
and you &apos;re gonna be invited ... plus one .
is she , like , expecting us to bring other people ?
no , brides are weird . go think about something else .
please ?
okay .
is he gonna make it ?
well , if yang can get her act together .
i keep diuresing him ,
but that &apos;s not gonna work for much longer .
hey , you &apos;re invited to mer &apos;s for thanksgiving .
really ?
i &apos;m invited and , uh , i &apos;m bringing you .
the attendings are gonna be weird if i &apos;m there .
no , they &apos;re not .
just go without me . we &apos;ll meet up after .
you think i wanna be there if you &apos;re not ?
you &apos;re sweet .
okay , screw it .
how about we get takeout chicken
and eat it in the car like we were raised to do ?
i think i love you .
yeah , yeah , settle down .
two more women responded to the ad .
one of them &apos;s gonna come by in about half an hour .
did she seem nice ?
yeah .
i told stan .
what ?
why ?
i couldn &apos;t let it go , and he--
oh ! he &apos;ll hate this .
it was supposed to seem natural ,
like someone you &apos;d met at the pool .
i can &apos;t lie to him .
we &apos;ve always been honest . that &apos;s how it &apos;s worked .
this isn &apos;t some big lie .
it &apos;s a kindness . you agreed .
well , that was before ...
before i was dying ?
it matters more now , not less .
so you &apos;re saying she performed unnecessary procedures ?
i &apos;m not saying anything .
i was shooting the breeze with a friend .
i wasn &apos;t making a report to the board .
i &apos;m sorry .
whatever . let &apos;s just reel it back in .
you know he can &apos;t do that , and i certainly can &apos;t .
but she &apos;s gonna handle it .
that is not what you said .
you said you saw the virgin mary in your toothpaste .
we were talking .
i need to pull her off the floor ,
at least until this is under control .
she was gonna go ...
i &apos;m sorry .
can you let me talk to her ?
yeah .
she seems nice , right ?
oh , the woman ?
yeah .
oh , i @-@ i don &apos;t know . i ...
okay , i tried to check her out ,
but i just ... there wasn &apos;t a good enough reason
for me to stay in the room .
it is strange . there &apos;s no question .
my wife and i looking for a female companion for her lover .
yeah , it &apos;s a first for me .
eh , you &apos;re young .
uh , donna and i had a wonderful marriage for 30 years .
and then the fire went away .
and we both found other people .
but she was still my best friend .
we somehow both hated the idea
of divorcing each other .
so now you &apos;re helping her pick somebody for ...
stan .
stan .
he--he &apos;s never been in love like this before .
she &apos;s afraid he &apos;s gonna be alone forever .
he &apos;s-- he &apos;s a wonderful person .
we--we played golf together for years .
i don &apos;t want to see him alone either .
you told the chief of surgery
that i have a psychiatric condition ?
it was an accident .
derek and i were talking
where the hell do you get ...
all we &apos;re talking about is a few days .
take a break ! figure out how to manage this .
stay out of my--
bench yourself ,
or the chief will .
miranda ...
you send your lackey to tell my lackey ?
you can &apos;t tell me to my face you &apos;re destroying my study ?
you know i &apos;m not destroying your study--
if i don &apos;t finish this phase by the end of this week ,
i lose my funding .
come with me .
please .
that &apos;s nathan . he &apos;s a real baby .
we &apos;re not talking about me . we &apos;re talking about him .
that &apos;s ashley , his mom .
he has a very nice father .
this isn &apos;t a study , meredith .
this is a baby .
nathan is the first one in his family
who &apos;s supposed to go to college .
i mean , he &apos;s a baby .
have you lost your mind ?
do you think that because i have kids ,
every time i see a child , i &apos;m gonna start lactating
and lose my ability to reason ?
no , i--
you wanted to do something flashy
with the equipment . it didn &apos;t work .
now you want me to shut down my entire study ,
so that you can run a hail mary
that very well might kill this very cute child .
baby nathan and all of his college potential ,
can get an artificial graft--
no .
like every other h.l.h.s. baby--
no , he can &apos;t .
because you can &apos;t make it work .
how many people ?
we might be up to 16 .
but some of them are kids , and they barely eat .
i thought this was dinner for four .
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
it just kinda got out of hand .
we can all just cook together .
i thought meredith doesn &apos;t know how to turn on an oven .
well , the rest of us .
i &apos;ll do all the shopping . i &apos;ll do all the planning .
i will do everything ,
and you just get to shout out orders .
okay , it &apos;s starting to sound better .
okay .
good .
so ... maybe i should quit while i &apos;m ahead but , um ...
what ?
cristina isn &apos;t ...
she doesn &apos;t have thanksgiving plans .
i mean , just as a friend ...
i , uh ...
you know , i shouldn &apos;t have said anything . just forget it .
no , owen . it &apos;s okay .
if you say you &apos;re over her , i believe you .
and really , it &apos;s up to meredith and derek
&apos;cause it &apos;s their house .
are you sure ?
you know , i want you to be comfortable .
well , i &apos;m gonna be cooking for what could be ,
at the end of the day , 30 people , so ...
i won &apos;t have time to be uncomfortable .
okay .
you know , i &apos;m gonna speak to her about the stuffing .
you think she could handle a deep fried turkey ?
i mean , there &apos;s nothing like it .
don &apos;t people kill themselves trying to make those ?
everything has a price .
you guys , my patient has a husband and a lover .
and she and the husband are interviewing women
for the lover to date when she &apos;s dead .
when the patient &apos;s dead ?
it &apos;s weird .
is that like a threesome thing ?
dr. webber !
i &apos;m just asking a question .
you hiding from grey again ?
on your way , edwards .
i need you to take over bailey &apos;s surgical load today .
i can &apos;t . my study is falling apart ,
and i have a palliative surgery later today . i--
meredith .
you ever done an ex @-@ fix before , murphy ?
no .
hmm . try it .
yeah . right there .
now the first cortex is hard .
then it &apos;ll feel spongy in the middle ,
and then hard again when you hit the second cortex , okay ?
that &apos;s it .
really push through .
uh , okay . it feels spongy .
okay , ease up a bit now .
now the pitch &apos;ll change when you hit the cortex , okay ?
can you hear it ?
oh , my god .
okay , you drilled right
through her leg into the table .
oh , my god !
no , it &apos;s--back it up . just put the drill in reverse .
i @-@ i can &apos;t--
put the drill in reverse !
i can &apos;t find the ... can you just take it ?
my hand is shaking .
okay , all right .
pull it together--
can you please just--
murphy , pull it together .
oh , please !
murphy !
can you please do something ?
callie , can you take it yourself ?
just give her a few minutes to calm down .
it was her ?
ten @-@ plus times ! that was her ?
that is just ...
perfect .
why would you tell her ?
i didn &apos;t . i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i told her it was someone .
i didn &apos;t say who . i mean , listen ,
she figured it out because you fell apart in there .
you could &apos;ve just forgotten about it ,
and gone on with your happy life .
this is my marriage we &apos;re talking about .
yeah , and it &apos;s my career ! she hates me now .
no , she doesn &apos;t .
oh , please . of course she does .
she can &apos;t blame you . she loves you .
the only one she can blame is me .
hey ...
so you realize that stephanie and i are serious ,
right ? you get that ?
yeah , yeah . uh @-@ huh .
great .
i think it &apos;s nice that you guys are , you know ...
whatever you are .
right , so--
so why is it that you invited her to your wedding
plus a guest and you &apos;re gonna invite me
plus a guest ? what &apos;s going on ?
right , yeah . um , i wanted to talk to you about that .
you are actually not getting an invitation ,
but stephanie is , so you could just be her plus one .
look , i put your name on the invite list .
your name is avery . we don &apos;t know any other as ..
you &apos;re literally the top of the list ,
first thing we see when we look at it .
i just ...
i didn &apos;t wanna ... rub it in matthew &apos;s face .
if he has a problem
with my name on a piece of paper ,
why should i be at this wedding ?
because of me .
because ... you &apos;re my friend and i want you to be there .
yeah .
yeah , well , i wanna be there , too , but ...
come on ...
jackson , i can &apos;t go through with this
if i don &apos;t have your blessing .
well , you have it .
all right , but ...
i don &apos;t think i should be there .
dr. grey was pulled into an emergency surgery .
so we are gonna have to push mrs. kaufman &apos;s procedure to tomorrow .
i--
what is she doing ?
i apologize . i &apos;ll be over here .
you don &apos;t have to actually date the woman she chooses .
i don &apos;t wanna date any woman !
that &apos;s why she &apos;s doing this , stan .
i thought you were gonna talk her out of it .
you need to tell her yourself .
you &apos;re both putting me in the middle .
because she listens to you .
she doesn &apos;t listen to anyone !
besides , this is not such a terrible idea .
i &apos;m not a child she has to arrange daycare for !
a bunch of women she scared up on the internet ?
this is ... it &apos;s awful .
it &apos;s taking her mind off what &apos;s actually happening .
that can &apos;t be the worst thing in the world .
she thinks she can find someone to replace her ?
you can &apos;t ... replace her .
nobody can possibly replace ... her .
why ?
why is this happening ?
he &apos;s desatted to 60 .
if we &apos;re gonna do this thing , we gotta do it now .
i can &apos;t . i don &apos;t have a conduit to put in him .
it won &apos;t be done for another six hours .
i don &apos;t know if he &apos;s gonna last that long .
okay .
okay , let &apos;s put him on an oscillator .
it will stabilize his sats for easily a day .
i don &apos;t wanna wait a day , cristina .
no , neither do i , alex .
but in the long run , it &apos;s still his best chance .
good .
well , thanks to you ,
my resident offered to service me .
what ?
drive me around the block before my battery dies .
ah . you gonna do it ?
shane ? no .
it &apos;ll be like having sex with a baby seal .
sats are better .
good .
why don &apos;t you talk to meredith ?
explain that everything is gonna be fine .
maybe she &apos;ll cut me some slack .
she &apos;s got a point .
which is what ?
you could put in an artificial graft .
we tried . he rejected it .
so try again .
pump him full of meds ,
hold him over for a couple years ...
until your brand @-@ new procedure &apos;s old news ,
tested hundreds of times . that &apos;s what i &apos;d do .
you wanna fight a different battle , that &apos;s your own problem .
you know , you &apos;re right , alex .
this is my problem .
your heart rate &apos;s pretty high .
keep going . i &apos;m fine .
this is when we &apos;re supposed to take it up a notch .
but i &apos;m not sure ...
wilson , i &apos;m gonna hurt you .
dr. webber , i don &apos;t think that we ...
no !
take it up again !
wilson !
oh , my god !
i need some help here ! dr. shepherd !
what happened ?
dr. bailey , could we speak for a moment ?
uh , i &apos;m about to get started here .
why don &apos;t i track you down when i &apos;m done ?
this is a conversation we should have now .
dr. grey can take over .
dr. bailey
i will speak to you when i am finished here .
do you mind ?
dr. grey , please move dr. bailey &apos;s bovie one inch to the left .
oh , don &apos;t touch--
grey ...
and move the suction one inch down .
get away from my
maybe even 4--
get away from my table !
bruising over the chest wall .
i need a portable ultrasound .
i don &apos;t need an ultrasound .
my rib &apos;s broken .
his pulse ox is low .
what the hell happened ?
please , don &apos;t .
he fell off the treadmill .
what--you &apos;re jogging now ?
oh ! yeah . rib &apos;s broken .
stress test . he wanted out of here .
all right , can we get a portable x @-@ ray in here ?
i &apos;m dr. robbins .
how you doing ?
i should probably go .
i mean , i &apos;m the last person they wanna see right now .
i &apos;m sure they &apos;re glad to have you here .
it &apos;s stupid , right ?
i mean , she &apos;s not even my kid .
maybe i could , uh , hang out a little , you know ?
see if they need anything ?
i can wait with you .
this is what the fracture looked like initially here .
what happened with bailey ?
i heard she got kicked out of her o.r.
i can &apos;t get into that with you .
come on .
oh , we don &apos;t have to go to kepner &apos;s wedding .
i talked to her . we don &apos;t have to worry about any of that .
why ?
it &apos;s just simpler .
you know , um , my patient and her husband
are interviewing women to date her lover when she dies .
they &apos;re all friends , and they &apos;re supporting each other
through this horrible time .
and when stan cries , victor hugs him .
that &apos;s what it looks like when people are over each other .
you think i should be hugging matthew ?
why aren &apos;t we going to the wedding ?
because my name starts with &quot; a. &quot;
because april is neurotic .
because matthew and i do not hug ,
and no , it &apos;s not gonna be comfortable .
it &apos;s awkward , frankly .
it &apos;s probably gonna be awkward forever .
but that does not mean
that it is not over between us because it is .
it &apos;s important to me that you believe that .
cause if you don &apos;t ,
i could really ruin our night .
i have some really nice ideas about our night .
okay , you &apos;ve had a day .
day &apos;s over . i need you to clear out .
we need some more time .
you have had more time !
i need to get started printing my portal vein by tonight or--
we &apos;re having trouble with the vacuum seeding .
and we need to print out another conduit .
again ?
yes , we started a new one ,
and it should be done by 3 : 00 a.m.
i mean , cristina , no . it &apos;s not working .
you are not christ child reincarnate .
you don &apos;t walk on water .
you have failed to revolutionize
modern medicine and save a baby all in one fell swoop .
and you are endangering a child &apos;s life while you--
stop !
excuse me--
that &apos;s enough .
ross , take a walk .
she wasn &apos;t gonna do this . because of you .
i practically had to force her into it .
ross , just--
because she cares about you .
oh , somebody &apos;s got the hero worship down !
no , you &apos;ve made this emotional .
you made it about your friendship .
if it was about the work ,
you would &apos;ve gone to the chief of surgery ,
but you know what he would &apos;ve said .
you &apos;ll get the printer tomorrow , dr. grey .
i &apos;m sorry if that was out of line .
i just couldn &apos;t listen to her go after you like that .
hey , you just about ready ?
i was gonna check on our patient before i left ,
but maybe you should make sure leah &apos;s not near the room .
i don &apos;t wanna make her cry .
she &apos;s not gonna cr--
look , i think that the next time
you exercise your right to play around
when we &apos;re taking a break , i &apos;m gonna ask you
to keep it out of the hospital .
not that it isn &apos;t fun , all the drama in the o.r ...
i realize that you &apos;re hurt , but when we got back together ,
we got back together based on the assumption
that we both made mistakes
and we were ready to start fresh .
i can &apos;t keep apologizing .
and you can &apos;t keep playing a victim .
if you want me back , i &apos;m back ,
but i &apos;m not here to be your whipping boy .
i &apos;ve been sleeping on the couch for a week .
if i &apos;m back ...
i sleep in the bed .
uh , okay .
i get a night to just digest this all .
and then fine , you can sleep in the bed .
that &apos;s enthusiastic .
arizona ...
fine .
if you spent half the time working that you do
having girl talk with shepherd ,
we wouldn &apos;t be in this mess .
yeah , 100 % my fault .
just stay out of my career !
i made one mistake .
oh , one ?
because i can think--
i should &apos;ve gone to owen hunt myself ,
and i should &apos;ve done it days ago .
i should &apos;ve stopped the test .
well , he &apos;s a hard guy to say &quot; no &quot; to .
yeah , but it &apos;s sort of my job .
well , he couldn &apos;t do the stress test .
he wasn &apos;t ready to go home .
you should go to dr. grey &apos;s for thanksgiving .
me and these guys are gonna hang out
with dr. webber . is that okay ?
oh , you &apos;re blowing me off for some old guy
in a hospital bed ?
i &apos;m sitting at the kids table .
i like the kids table .
you meet me after ?
booty call .
well , we can do a potluck .
what exactly are you gonna cook ?
i could probably handle a turkey .
you think they &apos;re gonna give you six hours off
to baste a turkey ?
it takes six hours ?
you &apos;re not making a turkey .
what about fried chicken ? from the colonel &apos;s ?
you said that you liked fried turkey .
the bucket lacks dignity .
it &apos;s family style .
they do make a nice mashed potato .
all right , i &apos;m gonna make a list .
uh , biscuits .
gravy .
coleslaw .
how many pieces ?
yes , and the gravy .
my best friend &apos;s a mean girl .
why did i choose that ?
i don &apos;t know .
it never bothered me
when she was mean to other people .
but it really sucks when she &apos;s mean to me .
well , is she mean or is she ...
what ?
nothing .
oh , meredith . you can invite cristina if you want .
you know , thanksgiving .
i checked with emma . she &apos;s fine with it .
well , i &apos;m glad she &apos;s fine with it .
it &apos;s just a cold .
muscle through it .
i &apos;m gonna go pick up the kids .
it &apos;ll pass .
nothing &apos;s really wrong .
we &apos;re doctors .
we &apos;d know if something was wrong .
we &apos;ll be fine .
