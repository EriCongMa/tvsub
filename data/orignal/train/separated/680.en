On my way to you with David Clarke's original check
to Nolan Ross for Nolcorp's start-up funds.
Nolan, your company, everything that you've worked for...
Means nothing if it could hurt
the only real family I've ever had.
If you'll consider me as a replacement to my father as C.E.O.,
we will move on Nolcorp
and triple our net worth inside a year.
Meet my brother Nate.
Jack's my partner in the bar.
Don't forget what you're doing here.
Turns out, they're good guys.
Well, the same can't be said about their old man.
How serious was it between you two?
Dobry Vecher.
Doesn't suit you.
What?
The bow tie or the Russian accent?
Both.
Well, I'm your servant.
So, uh, what do you fancy, Comrade?
Vodka.
Okay.
All right.
So... you got a name?
Yeah.
Sergei Lvovsky.
You know where I can find him?
Now that doesn't suit you.
What?
Your profession.
Sergei's in the V.I.P. area
with the other girls.
It's a dangerous game.
When Harvard finals clubs express an interest,
you don't--you don't keep them waiting,
especially Phoenix, all right,
where you're a legacy.
I'd just like to excel on my own merits.
Daniel, embrace the opportunities
our name affords you.
Especially since you've been opening your wallet
more than your books.
A $600 dinner at Meritage?
Meanwhile, Charlotte's in the Alps
with her grade school friends.
Well, I am looking forward to spending
Thanksgiving with my two men,
just the three of us.
Mr. Daniel,
there's someone at the front door for you.
He obviously doesn't understand
that these first few months of Harvard
cast the die that dictate his future.
Nonsense.
Daniel's a good boy with his head on straight.
I see we agree on one thing already.
Mother.
Daniel?
I'm sorry to spring this on you now--
It was my fault.
I called him a month ago...
the grandson I barely knew...
who I was certain would embrace my desire to...
mend fences.
The three of us met for dinner--
Grandma Harper, Mr. Greevy,
and myself--at Meritage.
Mr. Greevy?
Maxwell passed...
Almost a year ago.
I'm not sure whether to offer you my condolences
or my congratulations.
Love doesn't avail itself conveniently, dear.
I understand Conrad was married when you met.
Grandma was hoping to invite Mr. Greevy for Thanksgiving.
Was she?
Victoria, certainly
we can afford Marion one Thanksgiving.
She is your mother after all.
Yes, I'm fully aware.
Excuse me.
Victoria, what are you doing in my things?
Nothing.
I just want to look pretty for Thanksgiving.
For Thanksgiving or for Thomas?
I need all his attention focused on me this afternoon.
Yes, Mother.
Do you think he's gonna ask you to marry him?
He'd better. We're nearly out of money.
Nyet.
Nyet.
Nyet.
You.
You're trembling.
Dmitri will like this.
Clean off your face and let me look at you again.
The rest of you--
please, please, go, go. Go, go.
It's your first time, isn't it?
Who are you?
A friend, if you'll let me be.
I don't need friends. I need money.
There are other ways to make money.
Do you think I'd be doing this if I hadn't tried everything else?
An M.F.A. in art history is useless in this town.
At least here,
I can use it to talk about Kandinsky.
The man that you're auditioning to meet
is named Dmitri Bladov.
He traffics in women, the younger the better.
That's why they want you with no makeup.
You want to end up another victim?
I just want to pay my rent,
maybe get a job in a gallery somewhere.
Then do that.
Take this.
Why are you helping me?
Because you're gonna help me, too.
Find out exactly when Dmitri is expected to arrive,
then text the information to that number.
Tell Sergei that you want to go buy a new dress
before you meet Dmitri, and get the hell out of here.
Don't ever come back.
They call it "Protection money" for a reason, Carl.
I-I think I'm gonna pay.
They're just common hoods, Matt.
Don't let 'em scare you.
Well, Rumor is, Ryan's gonna use Thanksgiving
to send a real message to the holdouts.
That means you.
Let these crooks get a foothold, they'll never let go.
And if you pay them,
you might as well throw away your business.
I'm trying to protect my business.
My kids could be in danger, Carl.
Yours, too.
She's in port.
Let's plan that christening.
Hey, Sammy.
Your first boat?
You picked out a name for her yet?
The "Amanda."
My boy's first crush.
They were kids together.
My little girls are going through that, too, now.
Lucy, my youngest, is in the sixth grade.
She won't let me walk her to her class anymore.
Hey, Jack, listen, I want, uh,
you and Declan to go over to your grandma's for thanksgiving tomorrow.
I thought we were gonna do it here.
The turkey's already been thawed.
Yeah, well, there's a change of plans.
Some things come up.
All of a sudden?
Yeah. You got a problem with that?
You didn't pay for your drinks.
Put it on Sergei's tab.
You don't know Sergei.
You didn't speak to him. I watched you.
Keep your observations to yourself,
and there'll be a big tip in it for you the next time I see you.
And when will that be?
Tomorrow.
Your father would be proud.
I don't like this time of year.
Then your mission should provide needed distraction.
Are you afraid?
No.
I'm ready.
Ladies and gentle-mensas...
Thank you for giving up your thanksgiving plans
to join me here in the office today.
I was thinking instead of working,
let's play a game.
Now who can figure out...
The rest...of this equation?
Anyone?
Anyone?
Really, people?
Mr. Romero,
Care to take a stab?
Sure.
Let's see.
What--what's that, a "P"?
So long as that's an "I."
But that spells...
"I.P.O."
We are going public, people!
We all have everyone's favorite O.C.D. C.F.O. to thank--
Mr. Marco Romero.
Well, I couldn't have done it without you.
What's wrong with you freaks?
It's Thanksgiving.
Go be with someone special. Go home.
Oh, and, uh, grab a bottle of champagne on your way out.
On your way out.
Gotta say, I'm impressed with mom.
Grandma told me they hadn't spoken in 35 years,
And now mom's breaking out her favorite china pattern.
Oh, your mother's always been a big believer in second chances.
What do you have there?
I-I don't...
I don't want to bother you if you're busy. It's--
Holidays and weekends are a luxury the rich can't afford.
It's one of the many things I imagine you'll change
when you join the company.
The thing is, dad, I...
I may not major in business.
Oh. What then?
Poli-sci, prelaw?
Actually, I'm taking this freshman workshop
in creative writing.
Poetry, specifically.
And my professor actually thinks
I should consider pursuing it.
I-I don't know.
I-I just thought maybe if you wanted,
you could take a look at what I've written.
Help me decide, you know?
I'd be honored.
Daniel, of course.
Anything I can do to help support your dreams.
How are your plans against the Graysons?
On schedule.
I've severed all ties with Nolcorp,
Closed all my bank accounts, set up six dummy fronts,
one of which just bought a building on 57th Street.
Turns out Conrad Grayson
is sleeping with one of Victoria's best friends--
Lydia Davis.
I was working on a strategy
to turn their infidelity into my entree.
That was...
before you gave me this diversion.
Her name is Colleen.
She was kidnapped and sold by Dmitri Bladov--1993.
Did they find her?
No.
With this device, we will be in constant communication.
Get Dmitri alone and find me access.
And then what?
Then you're free to return to your true cause.
Nice touch, mother.
So this reunion,
It's just a charade
So that you can ensnare Mr. Greevy, isn't it?
Ben loves me,Victoria.
When he insisted on meeting the family,
My heart couldn't deny him.
So he can confirm its existence.
I think you'll find my Ben is a man of class and means,
much like Conrad.
And I hope that your heart, as mine,
cannot deny him either.
When have I ever denied you anything?
That's Ben.
Do not disappoint me.
You sure are a pretty little thing, Vicky.
A little glimpse of what your mama must have looked like
when she was around your age.
What are you now, 20, 25?
15.
Victoria.
Would you pour the coffee, please?
Thomas and I will take it in the living room.
Yes, ma'am.
Victoria.
Allow me to introduce Mr. Greevy.
Oh, call me Ben, of course.
Marion, your daughter is even more radiant than you described.
Thank you so much for welcoming me into your home.
The pleasure is mine, I assure you.
You look transformed.
Everything looks different in the harsh light of day.
Which makes it even more evident
why a girl like you shouldn't be here.
I'm serious. You shouldn't have come back here. Not today.
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.
Excuse me.
Are you Sergei?
Da.
I'm sorry to bother you.
My roommate, um, she's not feeling well,
And she wanted me... to tell you
That she won't be able to meet with Dmitri today.
I hope this doesn't screw things up for you.
But it does screw things up for me.
I don't know what to tell you. She's sick.
Tell me you will fill in for her.
It pays $3,000.
How old are you?
For $3,000,
how old do you want me to be?
Put your hands over your shoulders.
Dmitri is here.
Bring the Vodka to the table.
And don't be drunk when he takes you to the back room.
Takeda, can you hear me?
Yes. What do you see?
At least five armed guards. Possible Russian Militia.
Dmitri's on his way in from the back entrance.
Good. Let him take you to the safe room.
When you're alone with him, I will come.
You need to get out of here.
It's not safe.
I can take care of myself.
Go.
Mr. Bladov...
This is from Colleen.
Who?
My sister.
Gun!
Emily, abort the mission.
Get them out of here! Go!
Emily, go!
Go now.
I can't.
Quite a bold act for such a young girl.
My Daddy was in the service.
He taught me how to protect myself.
Your Daddy, huh?
Seichas.
Business before pleasure tonight.
Takeda, are you still there?
I am. Where are you?
In Dmitri's safe room at the west end of the hall.
The entry code is 5-3-1-9-5-3.
Door locks on both sides. Everyone is armed.
Do not move. I will come for you.
The bartender with the gun--
He's Colleen's brother.
Your safety must be your primary concern,
not this boy.
He tried to help me.
I can't just let them kill him.
I'll contact you when I find him.
You called me?
Yeah, I thought, uh,
You were spending the holidays with someone special?
Oh, no, I plan to.
Oh, well, in that case...
Happy Thanksgiving.
Well, admittedly,
a little untraditional.
But, uh, so are we.
What do you got there?
You're always looking out for everyone else,
and it's time someone looked after you.
Zoltan, Galaxy Defender?
This little guy's the reason
I started coding in the first place.
I know, I know.
You told me on our first date.
I am sorry. It's our new accounting firm.
Really, on Rhanksgiving?
Do not answer communicator device.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
Have you ever been married, Mr. Greevy?
I am a widower.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
It was the first thing we bonded over
when we met on the cruise.
Maxwell and I had the trip planned
a year before he died.
And... I was sure he would've wanted me to go.
What a noble gesture.
And what brought you
on to that boat, Ben?
You seem more of a yacht man than a cruise liner.
Mm. Quite so.
I just thought it would be nice
to let somebody else steer the ship for a change.
And so there was Benjamin in the owner's suite,
next to mine...
Like it was fate.
Well, it does sound almost preplanned.
Where is that maid of yours?
Oh, allow me, my dear.
I'll walk you to the bar.
In spite of what you think, Victoria,
I have genuinely fallen for him.
Oh, the same way you fell for your last husband?
Maxwell was different.
A means to an end.
Oh, you don't have to tell me that.
Was it worth it?
The 30 years I spent with him?
Of course.
No.
I mean what you had to do to keep him.
If you're asking would I change anything,
the answer is no.
Look at you now--
The matriarch of one of
the wealthiest families in the country,
a man who adores you,
two beautiful children.
Some would say you owe all of that to me.
You may think I knocked you down,
but you landed on your feet.
Ladies.
Dinner is served.
Are you all right, Victoria?
You don't have to go through with this, you know?
I can send them away right now.
Oh, you're wrong, Conrad.
I absolutely have to go through with this.
Dad?
What the hell are you doing, Jack?
I told you to keep away from here tonight.
Where's your brother?
I left him at grandma's.
What are you doing with a gun, dad?
I'm protecting what's mine.
I'm gonna fight for my boys this time.
Fight who?
Son of a bitch! Get the fire extinguisher.
What the hell is going on, dad?
One more time. Who sent you?
We'll give you five minutes to consider your situation.
Then we take you somewhere special
where my comrade's wish can come true.
I know why you're here.
I know what they did to Colleen.
Who the hell are you?
An ally.
If you were, you would've let me kill him.
Killing Dmitri is not gonna bring your sister back.
What do you know about the downing of flight 197?
It happened a week after my sister was taken.
What else? There's gotta be a bigger connection here.
My father worked as a baggage handler
at Heathrow Airport.
He worked the night the plane took off.
That's how they got the bomb on the plane.
No, there were the rumors, but he wouldn't have done that.
You didn't know him.
I didn't need to.
They used your father the same way they used mine.
Go.
Move, and you both die.
Looks like you get
to use those self-defense classes after all.
Make your daddy proud.
We should be calling the cops.
No cops. Just help me fix the window.
It's chilly in here.
Heard a bunch of places up and down the dock
got hit tonight.
And on a holiday like this.
It's almost like someone was trying to send us a message.
You know, I got two boys of my own.
Accidents happen on these docks all the time,
especially the kids.
Where's your little one tonight, Carl?
Declan, is it?
Hey, don't you ever mention my--
Dad, Dad, don't. Don't.
We'll pay.
Jack, what are you--
We just need a couple hours to get the cash together.
But we'll pay.
Smart kid.
I'll come back in an hour, and we'll make it official.
Break out a bottle of something.
Let's celebrate our partnership.
Me-- I like blue label Scotch.
Rich man's candy.
Jack, don't ever,
ever speak for me again.
Hey, the, um, the accountants found a problem.
They found the Cayman account I set up for you in 2002.
God, that was so long ago.
Oh, well, let me-- let me refresh your memory.
It contained nearly $500 million. Our company assets.
And as of six weeks ago, it's empty.
I...
It's gone.
But I-I didn't take it.
Where is it?
See, I'm your C.F.O.,
and you can't tell me
where nearly half a billion dollars went.
That doesn't work for me.
Marco. Marco.
Daniel, how goes that creative writing class
you were so excited about?
I don't know.
Dad, did you get a chance to read what I gave you?
I did, and I think your professor
was absolutely right to commend your talents.
In fact, if you don't mind,
I'd like to send them to some publishers I know.
Thank you.
We're so proud of you,
Daniel, no matter what you choose to do.
Always know that.
Mr. Greevy, do you have any children?
Sadly, no.
We never found the right time.
It's a good thing,
knowing when to start a family and when not to.
I certainly wasn't ready when Victoria came along.
Not that I... would change a moment of it.
Vicky is my greatest blessing.
Well, that's not what you said
the day you threw me out of the house.
What on earth are you talking about?
Mr. Greevy, would you like to hear the story
of our last Thanksgiving together?
I think, we... may have made a mistake in coming here.
We should go.
No, I-I-I'd like to hear the story.
You heard what he said, Mother.
Sit down.
I am not marrying you, Marion.
That is not what this is.
You can't leave me! How are we gonna survive?
Nobody promised to take care of you, and plus a kid.
Well, if it's because of Victoria, I can send her away.
Yeah, you would do that, wouldn't you?
Or is she the reason that you come by at all?
You are a sick woman, you know that?
Good-bye, Marion.
No! You are not leaving.
Get out of my way.
Thomas, please.
Get out of my way!
Thomas!
Victoria!
Come here, quickly.
You just couldn't control yourself, could you?
Batting your eyelashes like a little whore.
Come here.
Come here!
Take the gun.
Aim for his chest.
No, I can't.
We'll tell the police that he attacked us,
that you shot him to protect me.
No jury will ever convict you.
You'll be hailed as a hero.
My god, Victoria, if you don't do this,
they will take me away from you forever.
You will be all alone.
For god sake, do as I say.
Well... and she was right.
The grand jury failed to indict me,
though I was hardly hailed as a hero.
The judge sentenced me to a 6-month
in-patient psychiatric evaluation.
By the time I was returned to her,
she had already met Maxwell.
And then one night,
she saw him sneak into my room.
And the next morning, she threw me to the curb.
By that spring, they were married.
It's lies. Every word of it.
You threw me out on the street.
I was a child.
I was 15!
You drove a wedge between me and every man I ever loved.
I should've listened to your deadbeat father,
gotten rid of you before you were even born.
Marion, that's enough!
You will not say another word against my wife in this house.
Where are you going?
As far away from you as I can possibly get.
Get ready.
Dmitri!
Go. Go! Out the back.
Dmitri!
Emily!
Stop!
Get up. Get up and face me.
Tell me who hired you to take my sister.
Girls come to me willingly.
Not Colleen. I was there.
Aiden, no!
Aiden. Now I remember.
You were just a boy when we took Colleen.
She called your name when you chased after us.
Don't do this.
No good will come of it.
Listen to your girlfriend.
She speaks the truth.
You tell me where she is, you son of a bitch.
Probably dead.
If you pull that trigger,
you'll never know what happened to your sister.
Please.
Don't do this.
Don't move!
You saved me twice in one day.
Maybe your sister was strong like her.
But mostly, they break quickly.
If I remember correctly,
the girl you called Colleen--
she even grew to like it.
Shut up.
No!
No.
Go. Take him away from here.
Marco, wait.
About the missing money...
it all went to the daughter of our first investor.
What investor, Nolan?
Who are you talking about?
David Clarke.
What?
After the conviction, I set up the account
so his daughter could get what was rightfully hers.
After the con-- are you insane?
You don't know the whole story.
David was innocent.
Okay, you are insane if you believe those conspiracy theories.
Think about how this looks, Nolan, for you, for the company.
You are Nolan Ross.
That name means something now.
There would be no company without David,
and look, I wasn't about to screw over his daughter
after everything that she had been through.
If you don't... get that,
then I don't think we have a future together.
Okay, you... are choosing a convicted terrorist over me.
No.
I'm choosing a man that took me at my word
over my name.
And, uh... you're fired.
Here's your share of the company.
Oh, no.
No, I want no ties with you or your blood money.
Go to hell, Nolan.
Why, Victoria?
This was all I had.
This was my last chance.
You had many chances before this one.
When Maxwell died, we were nearly penniless.
I sold the house, liquidated my savings.
I have nothing.
But the fur on your back?
It serves you right
for choosing a pedophile over your own daughter.
I thought at least you'd enjoy taking pity on me.
Pity's not a quality you've taught me.
I have nowhere to go.
Well...
We do have a good number of rooms here.
Pity, as you say,
none of them are for you.
You vindictive bitch.
Oh, I learned from the best.
Good-bye, mother.
I have no doubt that you'll land on your feet.
Is that Daniel's poetry?
Merely copies, I imagine.
Well, surely, it can't be that bad.
Oh, on the contrary.
"We speak in hushed voices,
"so as not to wake our memories.
"The things we've done,
"the things we'll continue to do,
"for fear of breaking the cycle.
"How fierce we were when we were young,
when we were unafraid of coming unhinged."
It's for his own good, really.
You know, I'll have some publishers send Daniel courteous rejections,
and our son will go on to take his place at the head of Grayson Global,
where he belongs.
"For fear of breaking the cycle."
Well, you certainly did with your mother.
I just wired Mr. Greevy a sizeable sum,
and he thanked us for giving him
"the role of his lifetime."
Was it worth it?
Staging their run-in on the cruise
and orchestrating your mother's demise?
Has the darkness finally been lifted?
Ask me tomorrow.
Glad you came to your senses, Porter.
Take it, and don't ever threaten my kids again.
You know, you might want to share
your newfound peace of mind
with the rest of your pals
before it's too late.
For some, it already is.
Matt, what the hell are you doing?
Gutter rat put my little girl in the emergency room.
Hit and run right outside my front door.
Give me the gun.
It belongs to you anyway.
I followed him down here.
Broke in and stole it from behind your bar.
I'm sorry.
But Ryan had it coming to him. You know that.
We're in this together, right?
Dad?!
Wait here.
Mr. Duncan.
Hey... Jack.
Hey, how's it going?
What's going on? That sounded like--
Engine backfired.
Just showing Matt your new vessel.
That's a hell of a boat.
Yeah.
Hey, Jack, why don't you go back inside?
It's freezing out.
Yeah, I know that.
You coming?
Yeah, right behind you.
Is this your father?
What was he like?
He was kind...
generous,
funny...
Humble but strong.
He would've died for me.
Like my sister.
She didn't deserve what she got.
If your sensei will have me,
I want to learn how to save her.
What if she can't be saved?
Then I want to learn how to punish
every person that helped destroy her...
So that no family has to suffer the way that mine...
that way that our families suffered.
If you would have told me six years ago
that I'd be here...
in this bed...
with you...
I would never have believed it.
You fought for me when nobody else would.
And somehow
you convinced Takeda to take me on.
I blackmailed him.
Told him it was both of us or neither.
Well, it makes you wonder,
A guy that smart--
Maybe this was Takeda's plan all along.
You better not disappear on me again.
I won't, Amanda.
You get your brother's boat all tied up?
Yeah.
Well, thanks again for letting us use your slip
to bring the booze in.
Yeah, I mean, it should save us some money, right?
Which we could use to spruce up the place.
Maybe get people ordering this instead of the usual swill.
That's blue label. It's expensive.
Yeah. My pop's drink.
You know what he used to call it?
Rich man's candy.
All right.
Hello?
Is this Marco Romero?
Who is this? Do you know what time it is?
Oh, it's late. My apologies.
My name's Daniel Grayson with Grayson Global.
I have a business proposition for you--
One that involves Nolcorp.
I'm listening.
Age-old cure...
for anxiety.
Mm. Well, I'm quite certain
this won't bring me the solace I need,
now that Daniel has made himself a target.
You have to help me protect our son.
Well, then we have to block him
from taking control of the board,
no matter what it takes.
All right.
I never thought I'd see the day
where I wouldn't want him to have the job.
Never thought I would see
so many things that have come to pass,
but here we are.
Perhaps Daniel should've been a poet after all.
Where'd you sneak off to?
I wanted to show you something
since you're not going anywhere anytime soon.
Everything about my father's conspiracy
is in this box.
Everything...
about the girl I left behind
when I started on all of this.
God, it feels like a lifetime ago.
For me, too.
Double infinity.
A journey with no end.
