helium .
yes .
taylor swift .
yes .
pi .
yes .
kardashian .
more specific .
khloe ?
yes !
see , i remembered because if it looks like kim it &apos;s kim ,
if it looks kind of like kim it &apos;s kourtney ,
and if it looks nothing like kim it &apos;s khloe .
oh , that &apos;s a venn diagram ,
and i remember because i thought to myself ,
&quot; venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram ? &quot;
what are you guys doing ?
oh , well , we decided to use our breakfast time
to expand our respective knowledge bases .
oh , let me try .
hmm , atom of hydrogen , adam of maroon 5,
mic drop .
i &apos;m sorry , who is mike drop ?
oh , hey , penny , do you want to go to the airport
with me later to pick up my mother ?
sure .
thanks .
no problem .
hey , penny ,
um , since you &apos;re already gonna be at the airport ,
do i need to go ?
why don &apos;t you want to get your mother from the airport ?
well , i can do without the 40 @-@ minute car ride
where she criticizes every aspect of my life .
she can cover it in a car ride ?
i could do 40 minutes on your posture alone .
you really want me to pick up your mother all by myself ?
hmm , i just feel like
it would be a good chance for you to bond .
or a way for you to avoid her ?
i don &apos;t know what he &apos;s putting on those cards ,
but you are smarter than ever .
fine , if you really want me to , i will pick your mom up .
seriously ?
yeah , you know what , she is my mother @-@ in @-@ law ,
and i &apos;d like for us to have a good relationship .
that is very mature of you ,
so i &apos;m gonna go ahead and say , &quot; suckah . &quot;
all right , back to learning .
okay .
oh , easy , bill nye the science guy .
or as i know him ...
&quot; creepy old dude from dancing with the stars . &quot;
did you guys see there &apos;s an avengers screening ?
joss whedon &apos;s gonna show some deleted scenes
and do a question and answer session .
oh , well , i have a few questions for him
about the last avengers movie ...
and a whole lot of answers .
when &apos;s the screening ?
uh , it &apos;s tonight , but it &apos;s first @-@ come , first @-@ served ,
so we should probably get there early and wait in line .
let &apos;s do it .
penny &apos;s busy with my mother , so i &apos;m in .
oh , bad news .
amy &apos;s making me go shopping with her later ,
so looks like none of us can go .
you do realize we &apos;re allowed to have fun without you ?
in fact , that &apos;s usually the trick to it .
what time do we need to get there ?
uh , i &apos;d say by 3 : 00 .
you &apos;re really going without me ?
it &apos;s not a big deal .
go shopping with amy ,
and we &apos;ll save a spot in line for you .
you don &apos;t have the authority to save places in the line .
if i do that , i &apos;ll be cutting .
people do it all the time .
you know the golden rule of line etiquette :
&quot; no cuts , no buts , no coconuts . &quot;
if you really care that much ,
there are apps now that &apos;ll let you hire people to do stuff
like errands and wait in lines .
people are actually waiting in lines as a job ?
boy , makes me feel better about my life .
some of these guys make over $ 20 an hour .
and now i feel worse again .
i &apos;m not surprised leonard chose to avoid picking me up .
he &apos;s battled intimacy issues his whole life .
does he have difficulty maintaining erections ?
didn &apos;t even make it out of the parking lot .
uh , you know what , enough about leonard .
let &apos;s talk about you .
what would you like to do while you &apos;re here ?
dear , i &apos;m a psychiatrist .
you don &apos;t have to avoid having intimate conversations with me .
well , i &apos;d actually like for us to be close ,
but maybe we start with our favorite books
and work our way up to my husband &apos;s sex organs .
very well .
what &apos;s the last book you read ?
um , does pottery barn , spring count ?
penny , it &apos;s only natural to want your mother @-@ in @-@ law to like you ,
and i acknowledge i can be an intimidating person .
so what can i do to make this process easier for you ?
uh , for starters ,
maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything i say ?
and how does it make you feel
when i psychoanalyze everything you say ?
uncomfortable .
that was a joke , dear .
oh . sorry .
didn &apos;t know you made those .
hey , listen , what if we have a little
mother @-@ in @-@ law @-@ daughter @-@ in @-@ law dinner tonight ?
so just the two of us ?
or i invite a few girlfriends ,
&apos;cause hearing you say &quot; the two of us &quot;
just sent a chill right down my spine .
what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re not sheldon .
i thought that might come up .
sheldon hired me to go shopping with you .
hold on .
he paid you to get out of spending time with me ?
no , it &apos;s not like that .
there &apos;s a long line he &apos;d rather stand in .
so what are we doing ? old navy , build @-@ a @-@ bear ?
i get paid either way .
we &apos;re not going shopping together .
you sure ? i &apos;m happy to hold your bag .
and sheldon gave me money for a hotdog on a stick .
can you understand why i might be annoyed right now ?
look , lady , i just work here .
we &apos;ve waited in a lot of lines together , haven &apos;t we ?
remember when we camped out
for the doctor who panel at comic @-@ con ?
yeah , sleeping under the stars
with other fans who love the show as much as we do .
waking up , wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets .
stuart , what are you doing here ?
sheldon , you are the most inconsiderate person
i have ever met in my entire life !
where do you get off sending me
to shop with your girlfriend ? !
i don &apos;t understand .
you were happy to do this when i hired you .
why @-@ why are you upset with me now ?
oh , i &apos;m not upset with you , but amy &apos;s pretty bent out of shape ,
so she hired me to let you have it .
well , i suppose turnabout is fair play .
you &apos;re darn right it &apos;s fair play , you selfish jerk !
you know , just when i think
we &apos;re making progress in our relationship ,
we revert to our old patterns
where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed .
i mean , if he didn &apos;t want to go shopping with me ,
why didn &apos;t he just say so ?
maybe he couldn &apos;t get a word in edgewise .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;ve been going on and on .
oh , it &apos;s all right , dear .
sheldon has a brilliant and complicated mind .
it &apos;s understandable that being in a relationship with him
could be trying .
i called him &quot; babe &quot; once .
he asked me to get a drug test .
well , i do admire your resolve .
you &apos;re an extraordinary woman .
thank you .
you know , she &apos;s my mother @-@ in @-@ law .
why can &apos;t i bond with her like that ?
amy &apos;s with sheldon who she loves like a son .
you &apos;re with her son ...
who she doesn &apos;t .
do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him ?
oh , well , that still could be a big step for sheldon .
three minutes .
and he used a kitchen timer .
i felt like a soft @-@ boiled egg .
you know , being in a relationship with leonard
also comes with its challenges .
yes .
well , what can you do ?
maybe it &apos;s sheldon , here to say he &apos;s sorry .
sheldon says he &apos;s sorry .
bernadette , i &apos;ll give you five dollars to slam the door .
i would have done it for three .
boy , all this standing &apos;s making me tired .
good thing i brought my collapsible stick chair .
not the stick chair .
you look like an idiot on that thing .
sticks and stones may break my bones ,
but chairs on sticks are comfy .
is everything smoothed out with amy ?
uh , no , she &apos;s still pretty mad .
did you make the apology as sincere as i would have ?
i said , &quot; sheldon says he &apos;s sorry . &quot;
oh , well , that &apos;s laying it on a little thick .
you think it &apos;s time you apologize to her yourself ?
i suppose so .
but if i get out of the line , i &apos;ll lose my spot .
i &apos;m happy to hold your place till you get back .
you would do that ?
consider it my way of getting more of your money .
you &apos;re a good man .
so , beverly , did you know penny
is the number three sales rep at our pharmaceutical company ?
oh , i didn &apos;t realize you two work together .
well , we don &apos;t exactly .
i &apos;m a microbiologist for the research team .
oh , what are you currently developing ?
some exciting new anti @-@ anxiety drugs .
that &apos;s interesting .
i just attended a lecture on pediatric anxiety .
oh , was it , uh , dr. jenofski ?
i just saw his ted talk !
it was .
let &apos;s get back to penny .
hey , weren &apos;t you telling me
something great about your company car ?
it has seat warmers .
amy ! amy !
amy !
come in .
hello , everyone .
oh , beverly , good to see you !
i &apos;d love to chat , but there &apos;s a line
that could start moving any minute , so let &apos;s do this .
amy ?
a proper apology requires three steps .
step one-- an admission of wrongdoing .
amy , i was wrong .
step two--
a promise never to repeat said action .
amy , that action will never be repeated ,
and that &apos;s a promise .
step three-- an earnest request for forgiveness .
amy , i hope you can forgive me .
and i hope you do it right now ,
&apos;cause there &apos;s an uber waiting downstairs ,
and i don &apos;t want to repeat this apology nonsense
with my driver ganesh .
fine .
oh , thanks ! you &apos;re a peach !
beverly , we &apos;ll catch up soon .
bernadette , it was a pleasure as always ,
penny , you have spinach in your teeth .
how long have i had spinach in my teeth ?
since the airport , dear .
you look like you come with a kickstand .
you can &apos;t make me feel bad .
hmm , maybe not . leonard ?
so , when the aliens brought you back ,
they just left the probe in ?
i &apos;m back .
hey , how &apos;d it go ?
it went well .
yeah , i &apos;ve learned that if you never say you &apos;re sorry ,
the times you do really puts them on their heels .
uh , stuart , i relieve you of your line duties .
anyone else need anything before i go ?
i &apos;ll give you a dollar if make fun of raj .
that &apos;s mean .
five .
you look like tigger
if tigger looked like a jackass .
uh , if you ever need a reference or anything ,
just let me know .
hey , guys .
you made it .
did you see that ?
he just cut the line .
he &apos;s just joining his friends ; it &apos;s fine .
no , it &apos;s not fine .
it is a breach of line etiquette .
we &apos;re near the front of the line .
we &apos;ll get in either way .
what if every person in front of us lets someone cut ?
we &apos;d still get in .
what if each of those people let someone cut ?
still get in .
but then each of those people let someone cut ?
we &apos;d still get in , but first i &apos;d hit you
over the head with his stick chair .
excuse me .
oh , please don &apos;t .
uh , uh , i couldn &apos;t help but notice
that you cut the line .
oh , uh , i &apos;m with my friends .
it &apos;s cool .
well , no .
it &apos;s not cool .
if there were reserved seating ,
and we all had tickets , that would be fine .
but this line is first @-@ come , first @-@ served .
not &quot; show up tardy and nevertheless be first served &quot;
right here .
no .
you need to go to the back of the line .
uh , who made you line monitor ?
mrs. wunch in fourth grade .
and my slogan was &quot; a line that &apos;s straight
is a line that &apos;s great &quot; &quot;
is this guy for real ?
boy , i wish i could say no .
that was very nice of sheldon to apologize .
well , he &apos;s come a long way .
or a short way very slowly ,
so it feels like a long way .
your relationship with him is fascinating .
i &apos;m preparing to write a book on high @-@ achieving couples ,
and i would love to interview the both of you .
oh , sure .
i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll talk to sheldon about it .
you know , bernadette &apos;s husband is a former astronaut .
really ?
do you think he would be interested
in being interviewed as well ?
do i think he &apos;d be interested ?
sometimes i hear him pretending to be interviewed
when he &apos;s alone in the bathroom .
wonderful !
i &apos;ll give you my contact information .
um , you should probably talk to penny , too .
about what ?
okay , you know what ?
this is ridiculous .
i &apos;ve been trying to make a connection with you all day ,
and clearly i &apos;m getting nowhere .
well , are you seeking a connection
or just some form of validation ?
what i was seeking was some sort of friendship .
but at this point , i &apos;ll take you not insulting me to my face .
my intention was never to insult you .
you &apos;ve been doing it all day !
do you even know what an insult is ? !
well , it &apos;s not a clinical term .
but one example would be your marrying my son ,
and not inviting me or even telling me
the wedding was taking place .
okay , good example .
what about joss whedon &apos;s work makes you think he &apos;d be okay
with rule @-@ breakers and line @-@ cutters ? !
the avengers are rule @-@ breakers !
being vengeful is in their job description !
they work for shield ,
which is a sanctioned department of the u.s. government !
do you work for a sanctioned department of the u.s. government ?
as a matter of fact i do .
at a little place called the dmv .
he &apos;s got him there .
the d even stands for department .
excuse me !
excuse me , can i please see a show of hands ?
who here takes issue with this person cutting the line ?
told you .
well , what a sad state of affairs !
that you &apos;ve all been so ground down by life ,
you don &apos;t even notice when someone disrespects you .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re gonna get beat up ,
and it &apos;s not because of your chair .
you know , right now , at the back of this line ,
there &apos;s a movie fan like you
who &apos;s not going to get in ,
because this person simply doesn &apos;t care .
yeah , well , 61 years ago ,
there was another person at the back of the line
因为拒绝公车司机要求黑人给白人让座的要求而被捕
and her name was rosa parks .
okay , you may have to pretend you &apos;re black
to get us out of here .
now , let &apos;s follow in that brave woman &apos;s footsteps ,
and stand up for ourselves !
and @-@ and i realize that she stood up by remaining seated ,
but now is not that time to enjoy the irony of that .
now , i ask you again .
who here takes issue with this person-- ?
why should we listen to you ? you cut the line yourself .
i most certainly did not .
i saw you .
if you &apos;re feeling dizzy ,
it &apos;s because the tables have turned .
excuse me , i paid someone to wait in line for me ,
and then when i arrived , he left ,
so what you saw , my good woman ,
was &quot; swapsies &quot; not &quot; cutsies &quot;
oh , no , no , no , no , wait !
i ask you all again . a show of hands .
who here takes issue-- ? well , stop moving !
he &apos;s gonna get in !
buddy , let it go .
no , i can &apos;t .
this isn &apos;t right .
you did everything you could .
no , i could &apos;ve done more .
now , now , you denigrated the memory
of a great civil rights pioneer .
that &apos;s all anyone could ask .
to be honest , i &apos;m surprised you cared about the wedding at all .
i &apos;m still human , penny .
not getting invited to my own son &apos;s wedding
is difficult to ignore .
i know how you feel .
she didn &apos;t invite any of us .
it was spur of the moment !
but we did get to see a live stream of it on the internet .
i could &apos;ve watched it on the internet ?
thank you .
so if we would have asked you to come to vegas
to see us get married , you would &apos;ve come ?
no , i would &apos;ve said you &apos;re making a huge mistake .
but an invitation would &apos;ve been nice .
you really think we made a mistake ?
at the time i did .
but i @-@ i &apos;ve never seen leonard so happy ,
so ... perhaps i was wrong .
okay .
well , um , how about this ?
maybe while you &apos;re still in town ,
leonard and i could have another small ceremony .
you know , if you &apos;re interested .
i would find that perfectly acceptable .
she would find it perfectly acceptable !
you guys saw it ! we bonded !
howie ? you doing okay ?
you &apos;ve been in there a while .
i &apos;m fine . be right out .
am i an american hero ?
well , that &apos;s a good question , jim .
don &apos;t you think once an astronaut leaves the planet ,
he &apos;s a hero to all the nations of the earth ?
okey dokey .
i think i have time for one more question .
