第五季第八集
so , bernadette , how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses ?
well , if you don &apos;t mind looking like
an orange traffic cone , great .
girlfriends , i have the answer to our dress problems .
really ?
12 years ago , my cousin irene and her entire family
died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident
the night before her wedding .
that &apos;s horrible .
yes and no .
all those bridesmaids dresses remain unused
and available to us for free .
so it seems that cloud of odorless deadly gas
had a silver lining after all .
check it out ,
still in the bags .
the gowns , not the bridesmaids .
i don &apos;t know .
dead people &apos;s dresses ?
yeah , and cap sleeve ...
oh , i was hoping you wouldn &apos;t notice .
irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes ,
and sadly as it turned out , space heaters .
ladies , please .
these four walls once housed an intellectual salon
where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach .
but through no one &apos;s fault ,
penny ,
the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined .
and again , i &apos;m looking at no one in particular ,
penny .
fine .
what would you like to talk about , sheldon ?
what would you like to talk about , sheldon ?
why do you hate us ?
i &apos;ve prepared a number of topics that should appeal to
both the advanced and novice conversationalists .
okay , that time you looked at me .
who didn &apos;t ?
your skin is like alabaster .
do you even have pores ?
topic one :
&quot; faster @-@ than @-@ light particles at cern--
paradigm @-@ shifting discovery
or another swiss export as full of holes as their cheese ? &quot;
and converse .
all right , who wants to go
to my apartment and look at bridal magazines ?
oh , me .
through no one &apos;s fault , sheldon , we &apos;re leaving .
wait for moi .
you &apos;re leaving ?
sheldon , sometimes you forget , i &apos;m a lady .
and with that , comes with an oestrogen fuel need to page through
thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body .
new topice : women .
delightfully mysterious or bat @-@ crap crazy ?
totally .
what &apos;s wrong with cap sleeves ?
if you have the right figure for it , they &apos;re adorable .
hey , amy , what brings you to our neck of the woods ?
your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions
for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy .
she popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease .
it &apos;s hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious ,
and yet somehow you do it .
that &apos;s fun to have in a lunchroom .
the real fun starts when you get to pick the rat
you &apos;re going to feed it to , and maybe you choose
the beady @-@ eyed little mother who &apos;s been biting you all week .
please , we &apos;re eating .
can we get that off the table
and change the subject ?
can we ?
stand back ...
while i turn this conversation into a &quot; conver @-@ sensation . &quot;
this time , it &apos;s your fault .
i have 100 alphabetized topics from
&quot; artichoke-- come on , people , it &apos;s just a giant thistle , &quot;
to &quot; zzz-- the onamona @-@ poetry of sleep . &quot;
amy , how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me ?
i don &apos;t know , four or five years .
no , it &apos;s not gonna do it .
oy . bernadette keeps texting me pictures
of penny in bridesmaid dresses .
they &apos;re out shopping right now ?
yeah .
just the two of them ?
i guess .
that &apos;s cool , that &apos;s cool .
why are they asking me about this stuff ?
what guy knows what a sweetheart neckline is ?
leonard &apos;s coming down the home stretch !
come on , horsey , you can do this !
damn . come on , thigh muscles , you can do this !
yes ! first place .
i would have been a great jockey if i weren &apos;t too tall .
and scared of horses .
sheldon , you &apos;re up .
what ?
come on , it &apos;s your turn .
we said we &apos;d get more fresh air .
sorry . i &apos;m a little distracted .
i can &apos;t seem to get in touch with amy .
i tried e @-@ mail , video chat ,
tweeting her , posting on her facebook wall ,
texting her , nothing .
did you try calling her on the telephone ?
the telephone .
you know , leonard , in your own simple way ,
you may be the wisest of us all .
voice mail .
curiouser and curiouser .
if you &apos;re worried , we can go over there
and see if she &apos;s all right .
okay .
you know , i heard in the news
a bobcat has been spotted in her neighborhood .
i don &apos;t think amy was eaten by a bobcat .
who thinks amy was eaten by a bobcat ?
you do ?
leonard , i was just mentioning an interesting local news item .
now , thanks to you , i &apos;m worried amy &apos;s been eaten by a bobcat .
forget about the bobcat .
how can i ? you won &apos;t stop talking about it !
* everybody hurts *
* sometimes *
* everybody cries *
* everybody hurts *
* sometimes . *
she sounds weepy .
i don &apos;t like weepy . let &apos;s go .
she &apos;s your friend .
step up .
amy . amy . amy .
bye .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m single , i don &apos;t need this crap .
sheldon , what are you doing here ?
you didn &apos;t respond to
any of my electronic communications .
i wanted to be alone .
would you like to talk about it ?
and keep in mind that &quot; no &quot; is a perfectly viable answer .
sheldon , my world is crumbling around me .
point of order .
as you &apos;re in distress , it would be customary
for me to offer you a hot beverage .
but i &apos;m a guest in your home ,
so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage .
how do you want to proceed vis @-@ à @-@ vis beverages ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
nothing matters .
if you &apos;d like to take your mind off what &apos;s troubling you ,
uh , word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted .
penny and bernadette went shopping
for bridesmaids dresses without me .
and that made you feel ...
sad ?
yes .
i knew it .
just keep going .
i guess i &apos;m good at this .
it &apos;s just , i thought they liked hanging out with me ,
but i guess i was fooling myself .
when they were over here ,
did you fail to offer them a beverage ?
&apos;cause i can see how that could stick in someone &apos;s craw .
sheldon , i &apos;m going to ask you something ,
and i &apos;d like you to keep an open mind .
always .
at this moment , i find myself
craving human intimacy and physical contact .
oh , boy .
you know ours is a relationship of the mind .
proposal .
one wild night of torrid lovemaking
that soothes my soul and inflames my loins .
counterproposal .
i will gently stroke your head
and repeat , &quot; aw , who &apos;s a good amy &quot; &quot;
how about this ?
french kissing-- seven minutes in heaven
culminating in second base .
neck massage ...
... then you get me that beverage .
we cuddle . final offer .
very well .
oh , boy .
i &apos;m just saying , second base is right there .
mm , i &apos;m thinking about adopting some quirky affectation ,
like a pipe or a monocle
or a handlebar mustache .
for all those girls out there
looking for the indian monopoly man ?
this is not a safe place .
you can &apos;t share anything here .
the two of you need to get your women in line !
what ?
last night i was strong @-@ armed
into an evening of harp music
and spooning with an emotional amy farrah fowler .
this on a night
that i had originally designated for solving
the space @-@ time geometry in higher @-@ spin gravity
and building my lego death star .
and why ? your gal pals , penny and bernadette ,
went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without amy ,
an action they took with no thought or regard
as to how it would affect me , the future of string theory
or my lego fun time !
what do you want us to do about it ?
you clearly weren &apos;t listening to my topic sentence :
get your women in line !
you make them apologize to amy and set things right .
i am a man of science , not someone &apos;s snuggle bunny !
why do i have to talk to penny ?
she &apos;s not my girlfriend .
you invited her to lunch four years ago .
everything about her is on you ; you make it so !
moo @-@ shu is penny .
thank you .
where &apos;s sheldon ?
he was up late last night ,
so i gave him an early dinner and put him to bed .
that &apos;s so sweet .
yeah , but now he &apos;s gonna be up at dawn and want to play .
so , listen , guys ,
the reason he was up late is because he was
taking care of amy .
she &apos;s kind of upset .
why ?
her feelings got hurt because you guys
went dress shopping without her .
i told you that would happen .
okay , look , this is her first time being a bridesmaid
and she &apos;s just getting a little crazy with it .
she keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions
in other cultures , and they &apos;re all about
getting naked and washing each other .
yeah , and she keeps trying
to figure out if our cycles have synced up
so we can call ourselves &quot; the three menstra @-@ teers &quot;
we thought it would be easier
to look at dresses one time without her .
i feel terrible .
i know . me , too . we &apos;ll talk to her .
hey , wait ,
how did she find out ?
raj did it .
and he says he would do it again .
hey , i &apos;m sorry .
you sent me the picture ; i wasn &apos;t thinking .
oh , howie .
well , hey , i &apos;m usually
pretty good at not blabbing .
you tell me tons of stuff about these guys ,
and i never repeat it .
what do you tell him ?
oh ,
you know , just pillow talk .
you guys have nothing to worry about .
hold on , did you talk about us when we were dating ?
no . all your little secrets are fine .
yes , absolutely fine .
i &apos;ll tell you later .
come on , tumor .
come on , tumor , mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma .
yay , brain tumor !
probably not the same reaction you had when you got the news .
hi .
hello .
what are you doing here ?
well , look , we just wanted to apologize
for not bringing you with us the other day .
that &apos;s not necessary-- it &apos;s like sesame street says :
&quot; one of these things is not like the other ,
one of these things should die alone . &quot;
come on , amy , let us make it up to you .
we &apos;ll have a girl &apos;s night ;
we &apos;ll do whatever you want .
we can go down to the korean baths
and do that thing you were talking about
where we wash each other .
with @-@ with loofah mitts , no hands .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m glad this happened .
i can stop pretending that some beautiful girl
and her cute @-@ in @-@ the @-@ right @-@ light friend
want to hang out with me .
amy , we &apos;re really sorry .
yeah , we feel awful .
don &apos;t . i &apos;ll be okay . you &apos;re not the first girls
i thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me .
it &apos;s like elementary school , junior high ,
high school , undergrad , grad school ,
and that semester abroad in norway all over again .
oh , come on , amy .
you don &apos;t get it .
look at this brain .
i don &apos;t really want to .
this is us .
bernadette , you are the analytical ,
scientific left hemisphere .
penny , you &apos;re the creative , spontaneous right hemisphere .
and where &apos;s amy ?
she &apos;s right here-- the sad little tumor
no one wants to go dress shopping with .
amy , you &apos;re not a tumor .
penny , tell her she &apos;s not a tumor .
did you know that when alexander graham bell
invented the telephone ,
he proposed answering it with &quot; ahoy &quot; ?
ahoy .
i like it .
amy ? is that you ?
have you been drinking ?
i &apos;m sorry , i bet my sweet what ?
well , all right . we &apos;re on our way .
what &apos;s going on ?
it would seem amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot .
really ? amy ?
leonard , be glad you can &apos;t keep a woman .
they are a handful .
oh , look .
it &apos;s sheldon and little leonard .
hi , little leonard .
hi , amy .
hey , cuddles .
cuddles ?
yes , cuddles . we cuddled .
grow up , leonard .
amy , what are you doing here ?
i came here to get a bottle of wine
like penny taught me to do when you &apos;re sad .
yeah , but why didn &apos;t you go back to your apartment ?
didn &apos;t you go to high school , leonard ?
parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out .
not that the rat bastards ever invited me .
maybe we should get you home .
oh , hang on , hang on , hang on . sheldon ,
what would it take for you to go into that liquor store ,
buy a bottle of hooch ,
take me across the street to that motel ,
and have your way with me ?
yeah , sheldon , what would it take ?
i &apos;m begging both of you , please , let &apos;s go .
okay .
come on .
upsy @-@ daisy .
ooh , finally someone found second base .
i know how you feel .
i got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe , too .
what do you want ?
do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back ?
i never gave you a friendship bracelet .
when we first met , i made one and pretended you gave it to me .
you can have it back if you want .
no , you made that for you ; i want you to have it .
we know you &apos;re upset , and you have every right to be ,
but if it &apos;s okay with you , we &apos;d like a second chance
to make things right .
we are really sorry ,
and we were trying to think of some way to show you
how much we care about you .
which is why
it would mean so much if you would agree
to be the maid of honor at my wedding .
what ? wait , is this some kind of practical joke ?
like in norway , when my &quot; friends &quot;
trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter ?
no . i @-@ i want you to be the maid of honor .
oh , my gosh .
no one &apos;s every asked me to be the maid of honor before .
well , that &apos;s not true .
once , but then they all died .
so is that a yes ?
yes . yes .
oh , my gosh ,
i @-@ i have so much to do .
there &apos;s the bridal shower and the bachelorette party .
what should we do for the bachelorette party ?
oh , i know-- we &apos;ll go to a native american sweat lodge ,
we &apos;ll take peyote , roll around in the mud ,
and paint fertility symbols on bernadette &apos;s naked body .
so that &apos;s happening .
yeah , sure , sure .
vegas is fun , too .
i feel like crying .
of course , i could just be hormonal .
oh , wait . maybe our menses are finally syncing up .
bernadette ?
no ? penny ?
sorry .
really ?
okay , yeah .
yay !
maid of honor amy farrah fowler &apos;s
amazing behind @-@ the @-@ scenes wedding video ,
take one .
we &apos;re just trying on dresses--
do we really need to record this ?
i &apos;m sorry , are you the maid of honor ?
i am the bride .
so no . and action .
what do you think ?
i love it !
what are you , a nun ?
come on , bestie , let &apos;s see some skin .
amy ! looking sexy !
you think they don &apos;t have mirrors in there ?
i know how i look .
bernadette , you look beautiful !
you do .
thank you .
not penny beautiful , but beautiful .
come on , bestie , you &apos;re up .
give me a minute .
what is taking you so long ?
oh , amy ! get the hell out of here !
sorry , sorry .
oh , god .
amy !
sorry .
