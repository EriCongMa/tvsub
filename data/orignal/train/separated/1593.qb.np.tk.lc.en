there &apos;s this girl , sarah .
liam told me you would do something like this .
he doesn &apos;t love you , sarah . he &apos;s just using you .
you don &apos;t know that .
we &apos;re adopting the baby .
it seems one of the big @-@ wigs at idyllwild
saw you play at some music competition last fall ,
and would like to offer you
a full ride to their summer music program .
so you can go on the tour .
yes , but i want to go to idyllwild ,
if i can get it .
i ... saw ana at my dad &apos;s .
i guess she &apos;s been sending letters to her parents ,
trying to make amends ,
but they keep returning them , unopened .
that if her parents knew that ana was pregnant ,
maybe they would take it ?
daria and taylor are sneaking out tomorrow night
and they want us to come .
my dad &apos;s got tons of booze . let &apos;s break in and steal some .
hey ! who &apos;s there ? !
it &apos;s my dad !
go ! go ! go ! go !
i guess he thought his daughter was spending the night out ,
so when the kids snuck in to get some alcohol
he thought he was being robbed and grabbed his gun
it was dark , he fired , and he hit the boy .
they &apos;re working on him now .
ok , thank you .
you bet .
he &apos;s gonna be ok , love .
he &apos;s gonna be all right .
the bullet entered the foot here ,
and thankfully passed clean through .
we need to operate to repair the tendons but i don &apos;t think
we &apos;re talking about permanent damage here .
he , uh , he plays baseball , is he still gonna be able to ?
well , he &apos;s not gonna be on the field anytime soon ,
but you can tell the padres
to keep holding his spot in the line @-@ up .
i &apos;m gonna send the nurses in , to get you prepped ,
and we &apos;ll get this taken care of .
thank you .
what the hell were you thinking , sneaking out like that ?
what kind of idiot breaks into someone &apos;s house
in the middle of the night ?
is this about that girl ? that girl daria ?
is that why you did this ? is that why you snuck out ?
no .
it &apos;s not ? it &apos;s not why you did it ?
it &apos;s not , ok ? !
i snuck out so i could see jude , all right ? !
what does that mean ?
stealing alcohol ? who &apos;s idea was that ?
i don &apos;t ... i can &apos;t really remember .
jude , you are way too young to be drinking .
i know .
we weren &apos;t ... we weren &apos;t thinking , i guess .
i &apos;m really sorry .
how is he ?
he &apos;s ok .
they &apos;re getting ready for surgery .
can i see him ?
um ... not right now .
can i talk to you for a sec ?
sure .
he &apos;s gonna be in surgery for a while now .
there &apos;s nothing we can do here ,
so we should probably go home .
what did he say ?
he said that he doesn &apos;t want you to see connor .
what about tomorrow ?
no . he doesn &apos;t want you to see connor at all .
he doesn &apos;t think you should be friends anymore .
connor told him it was all your idea ,
the sneaking out , the drinking , all of it .
is that true ?
so is he gonna go to jail ?
i don &apos;t think so .
he turned himself in to police right away ,
and it was unintentional , so ...
they were in his house , right ? i mean ,
doesn &apos;t california have a stand your ground law ?
yeah , something like it , anyway .
so now we have to worry about
which of our kids &apos; friends &apos; parents keep guns in the house ?
the times we live in ...
well , you have a gun in the house , right , mom .
yes , i do , but it &apos;s for my work and it locked up in a safe .
so what are you guys gonna do about jude ?
don &apos;t worry about jude &apos;s consequences , we will handle that .
just don &apos;t pick on him . he had a really bad night .
i didn &apos;t think he had it in him .
i know we said that we were
gonna tell the kids today about adopting the baby .
but it can wait , don &apos;t you think ?
you think ?
that is , of course , unless you have
some other super secret plan you &apos;re keeping from me ?
all right , i &apos;ve gotta get dressed .
hey , can i ride with you today ?
why are you going to school ? it &apos;s teacher work day .
dance team .
sure , honey , but mom and i have to meet with callie &apos;s social worker ,
so , it &apos;ll be a bit .
ok .
and , hey , you &apos;re still taking me driving today , right ?
after the dentist ?
you &apos;re giving mariana a driving lesson ?
what , wait a minute , when did i say this ?
last week .
no fair . i have my permit too .
and only one of you had to take the test twice .
shut up ! those questions were way too obvious .
i thought they were trying to trick me .
&quot; when you can to a stop sign , you should ...
a , always stop ,
b , sometimes stop ,
c , stop except in an emergency . &quot;
always stop ? really ?
i figured it couldn &apos;t be that stupid , could it ?
turns out , it was .
well , listen , even if i did say i would take you driving ,
and i &apos;m not saying i did , i forgot .
and i also forgot you have a dentist appointment .
so your brother &apos;s gonna have to take you .
what ? no ... i do have a life , you know .
yes , we know you do .
and we all appreciate the huge sacrifices
that you make for us .
you know , there is someone who could teach us how to drive .
no . no way . not happening .
you &apos;ve never done anything like this before ,
jude , i don &apos;t get it .
was it connor &apos;s idea ?
i think he &apos;s a bad influence on you .
i don &apos;t think you guys should be hanging out as much .
you know what , shut up .
excuse me ?
no , do not talk to me like that .
then stop telling me what to do .
and you don &apos;t have to worry about me and connor hanging out ,
because his dad said we &apos;re not allowed to be friends anymore , ok ?
maybe that &apos;s for the best . you &apos;ll make new friends .
just leave me alone .
so you &apos;re sure it &apos;s ok if i take this ?
yeah , it &apos;s fine .
ok , i &apos;ll get it back to you when i &apos;m ...
what ? when you &apos;re done sleeping forever ?
just keep it .
you don &apos;t have to do this . you don &apos;t have to move out .
mike , we been through this .
i &apos;ll back off , i &apos;ll let you alone .
just ... stay .
look , i know it &apos;s not the perfect place , but it &apos;s fine .
and it &apos;s just until i have the baby ,
and then , when i give her to stef and lena ,
i &apos;ll figure something else out .
maybe i &apos;ll move to riverside or find some place cheaper .
so you &apos;re decided ? a hundred percent ?
she &apos;s gonna grow up in a wonderful home ,
with her brother and sister .
it &apos;s the right thing .
emancipation is a long , involved process .
yes , well , we don &apos;t have a long time
to get it taken care of , so ...
ok then , the first thing you need to do
is you &apos;ve gotta get off probation .
there &apos;s no point in even starting things until that &apos;s cleared up .
well , that shouldn &apos;t be a problem ,
she has a probation hearing coming next week .
yeah , and her p.o. is 100 percent on board .
ok , good , but ...
... when did you start taking out credit cards , callie ?
i ... i don &apos;t have any .
really ? because i pulled your credit report ,
to get things ready for today ,
and it looks like you &apos;ve got four delinquent cards .
what ?
no , there must be some mistake , these aren &apos;t mine .
are you sure about that ? because according to this ,
you &apos;ve accrued about $ 24,000 in debt .
are you sure you didn &apos;t sign up for something ... maybe online ?
no ! no , i swear . i can &apos;t believe this .
how can someone just take out credit cards in my name ?
it &apos;s pretty easy , unfortunately .
all people need are a few pieces of personal information .
ok , well , resolving this with the credit bureaus can take years .
so if this is true ,
the only way you &apos;re going to get off probation
is to prove that someone else stole your identity .
great . so how are we supposed to do that ?
prove that someone else did all this ?
i have to be in front of the judge in a week ?
it &apos;s what i do , callie . just let me figure it out .
and what if you can &apos;t ? what then ?
the poor kid is so devastated
that connor would throw him under the bus like that .
well , connor &apos;s afraid of his dad . with good reason .
and we both know adam can be a little quick to react .
and in his defense , his kid did get shot .
maybe he &apos;ll cool down .
maybe .
we should probably plan
an assembly for next week to talk about it .
maybe we can combo it with some gun safety ,
that kind of thing .
good idea .
hey , are we meeting in here ? i got you a ...
sorry , i thought it was just the two of us ,
sorry , lena .
no worries .
actually , i &apos;ll meet you in my office in a minute . and thank you .
oh , ok , uh , great .
what ?
he never brings me coffee .
he &apos;s just trying to make a good impression . i &apos;m his boss .
so am i.
oh , hush .
i &apos;m sure he just never thought of it before .
besides , aren &apos;t you more of a tea drinker anyway ?
ok , that was so good !
oh my god , i &apos;m so excited !
you guys are killing it . see you tomorrow .
and by the way , thank you so much for giving us another chance .
it was really fun , i &apos;m glad i did .
and just so you know , i meant it
when i said i promise not to turn into kaitlyn again .
she really is a girl , who knew ?
and you really are an idiot , jack ,
who knew ? oh , wait , everybody .
so now i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m looking at , in terms of probation ,
the judge may give me more time , for all i know .
yeah , well , it &apos;s super common with foster kids .
so many people have access to all our personal info ,
it &apos;s just so easy .
good news is you caught it now , you know .
a buddy of mine didn &apos;t ... he didn &apos;t
find out until he &apos;d already aged out of the system ,
and then , by that point ,
his credit was so bad he couldn &apos;t get a job ,
he couldn &apos;t find a place to live and he ended up on the street .
sorry , that was ...
that was actually supposed to make you feel better .
i &apos;m not really sure why .
look , if there &apos;s anything at all i can do , let me know , ok ?
i ... would you help that girl .
um , we know each other a little bit
and we &apos;re not exactly friends .
uh , yeah , sure , no problem .
no , that &apos;s not gonna work ,
this is a time @-@ sensitive investigation
and i need those credit card statements emailed
to the address that i gave you today .
yes , exactly . thank you .
what was that about ? credit trouble ?
told you not to buy that house .
it &apos;s not ... don &apos;t worry about it .
hey , so ...
i moved ana into her new place this morning .
that &apos;s good . i think that &apos;s the right thing , for both of you .
yeah , no , it &apos;s fine , just i &apos;m
not sure this is the best situation for her .
mike , you have gotta let go .
ana &apos;s an adult , she &apos;s gotta make her own decisions .
it &apos;s not your problem anymore .
you can &apos;t keep trying to control everything .
i realize that , but ...
mike , i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;ve gotta go .
so what did she want ?
she just wanted to schedule a follow @-@ up with her casa .
i guess she &apos;s trying to get out of her current foster home .
is it bad ?
i guess so , yeah .
what ?
nothing . um ...
it &apos;s just , the foster home she was in , the one before this one ,
it was pretty awful , too .
how do you know that ?
&apos;cause i was in it before her .
and i &apos;m the one that got her pulled out .
ok , give it a little gas .
why did i let you talk me into this .
well you did , so ...
we can stop anytime .
ok , let &apos;s try again , uh , gently .
ok , there you go .
good job .
you don &apos;t always have to keep
your hands at ten and two , just so you know .
that &apos;s not what the experts say .
and they changed it to nine and three .
ok , well , do you wanna try speeding up a little ?
ok , i think that &apos;s probably enough for today .
maybe , yeah , maybe we should just go back to the house .
hey , before we go home , could we could go see the gutierrezes ?
what ? why ?
to deliver the letter .
but why ?
what did you think i was gonna do with it ?
it &apos;s a letter from ana to her parents .
no , i told you to like to write to them .
i mean ...
look , can &apos;t you ask moms to take you ?
moms who still haven &apos;t even told me
that they &apos;re not adopting the baby ?
yeah , somehow i don &apos;t think that &apos;s gonna happen .
what &apos;s the big deal ? we &apos;re just dropping off some mail .
think of it as helping me
prepare for a future career at the post office .
come on , please .
i wanna do it for the baby .
what do you think is gonna happen ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe ana &apos;s folks can take her since moms aren &apos;t gonna .
i just don &apos;t want her to end up with total strangers .
but i drive , ok ?
this it ?
looks nice .
you sure you &apos;re ready for this ?
gracias . come again .
hello , beautiful young people !
try our pan dulce ? it &apos;s fresh .
oh , no thank you .
well , suit yourself .
it &apos;s the best in the city .
um , we &apos;re looking for mr. or mrs . gutierrez ?
i &apos;m mr. gutierrez . what can i do for you ?
um ... i &apos;m ... my name is mariana .
this is my brother . my adopted brother .
i &apos;m ana &apos;s daughter .
ana was or ... ana is my birth mother .
i , uh , i have this letter that she ...
the delivery is here , papa .
who &apos;s this ?
um , some kids looking for jobs .
i was just telling them that we &apos;re not hiring .
come back in the fall ,
everybody stops eating bread in the summer ,
to fit in their bikinis .
good luck .
thank you .
brandon took you driving ? ?
he told you ?
wait , is there something else ?
i met our grandparents .
you did ?
i tried to get them to take ana &apos;s baby , and ...
are they going to ?
what were they like ?
i don &apos;t know .
they wouldn &apos;t even talk to me .
you know , i always wondered why they didn &apos;t come get us ...
when ana couldn &apos;t take care of us anymore .
now i guess i know why .
they didn &apos;t want anything to with us .
don &apos;t cry .
whatever .
it is what it is .
i just feel awful for that little baby .
but what &apos;re you gonna do ?
so i got your so @-@ called credit card statements ,
and whoever is posing as you is buying
a bunch of these high end handbags here in town .
those are high end ?
very .
i have terrible taste .
ok , so they have like a handbag obsession ? how does that help us ?
no , i &apos;m pretty sure they &apos;re not buying them for themselves .
a lot of identity thieves will buy expensive stuff ,
and then resell them online for cash .
so now that i have the serial numbers ,
i will meet with a few people
that are selling them on craigslist ,
and if the numbers match ,
we &apos;ve got our thief .
ok , thanks for coming in early , everybody .
so the coder &apos;s challenge is only a few weeks away
and they just released this year &apos;s rules ,
the project is to design , produce , and market an app
to a team of real investors .
hm . like shark tank ?
yeah , something like that .
so we have to divvy up the workload
and come up with a concept .
why don &apos;t me and mark and javi do the coding ? any objections ?
jay and me can do any engineering or building or whatever .
ok .
and why don &apos;t mariana and emma
do all the marketing and stuff ?
mariana pretty much coordinated the walkout
for timothy single @-@ handedly ,
she &apos;s like a social media monster .
all right , that work for you guys ?
how are you ?
i &apos;m ok , as long as i don &apos;t look online or anything .
the kids from school are calling my dad
a psycho murderer and stuff like that .
really ?
yeah , and he feels so terrible .
he hasn &apos;t even gotten outta bed today .
how are you ?
connor &apos;s dad doesn &apos;t want us to be friends anymore .
for real ?
yeah . connor told him the whole thing was my idea ,
the sneaking out , the drinking , all of it .
why would he do that ?
i dunno .
especially since it was your idea .
well , nobody made you come with us .
i know .
way to make me feel like a jerk , jude .
i &apos;m sorry . it wasn &apos;t your fault ,
thanks .
so , have you talked to connor ?
no , he &apos;s not answering my texts or anything .
maybe his dad took his phone away ?
maybe , but i don &apos;t get it ,
why would connor tell him that all of it was my idea ?
i &apos;m gonna see him later , you want me to tell him something ?
you are ? why ?
my dad and i are going to the hospital to apologize .
just ask him why .
ok , emma , a little bit more hips . gotta do it like this .
hips , down , up ,
one , two , three , four , pop , pop , pop , pop .
does it have to be so sexual ?
well , yeah , kinda .
well , it &apos;s kinda degrading .
what &apos;s with you ?
it &apos;s just ...
i &apos;m not sure that this is for me .
what ? why ? you &apos;ve been having so much fun .
i guess i just wanna be taken seriously
and i don &apos;t think anyone is gonna do that
if we &apos;re out there , shaking our asses .
is this because of the wrestlers ?
it &apos;s not just them , it &apos;s everybody .
i mean , look what happened today in stem .
what happened today in stem ?
they put us in charge of marketing and social media .
yeah , and ?
we got put in charge .
it &apos;s not like they asked us to be secretaries or whatever .
yeah , they put us in charge of the girl thing .
we might as well be spokesmodels .
what &apos;s wrong with being a spokesmodel ?
i &apos;m like the best coder in there ,
but suddenly i &apos;m a joke .
oh , and you think that &apos;s because you &apos;re on the dance team now ?
it doesn &apos;t help .
we &apos;re athletes .
look , i &apos;m sorry , i just ... i really don &apos;t get it .
it &apos;s not like you suddenly became stupider ,
because you joined the dance team .
what &apos;s wrong with being sexy ?
nothing .
i just don &apos;t wanna be perceived that way .
i have more to offer than just my ass , you know .
who said you didn &apos;t ?
but why can &apos;t you be both smart and sexy ?
why do you have to choose ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s just the way it is .
so what &apos;re we gonna do ?
i mean , we need six dancers to compete .
i know .
we &apos;ll ... we &apos;ll pick this up tomorrow .
i gotta go .
and you know , now she won &apos;t even talk to me ,
ever since i told her i &apos;m not gonna go on tour .
jesus , seriously ! slow down or you &apos;re walking home .
and put both hands on the wheel . ten and two .
actually , wait , nine and three .
i &apos;ll tell you one thing though , i &apos;m not calling her this time .
she can come to me when she gets over herself .
dude , girls don &apos;t come to guys . that &apos;s not how it works .
she was gonna go on tour without me !
so why am i the bad guy if i wanna go to idyllwild ?
&apos;cause you slept with her .
what does that have to do with anything ?
you slept with her , then you said you didn &apos;t wanna go on tour .
so , wait , you think she feels like rejected ?
no , lou &apos;s not like that . she &apos;s not that kinda girl .
you don &apos;t have to be that kinda girl
to get your heart broken , dumbass .
what &apos;s this ?
they &apos;re ana &apos;s . she left &apos; em at my place .
like you said , she &apos;s no longer my responsibility
so if you could take &apos; em to her
whenever you get a chance .
ok , thanks . i will .
why aren &apos;t you in uniform ? where you goin &apos; ?
i &apos;m going to buy myself a handbag .
hey , sarah .
i volunteer here .
good for you .
yeah , no , i , um , i hope you get a good placement ,
in a new foster home .
me , too .
and , um ... i want you to know ,
i &apos;m not , like mad about the trial and all that .
i totally get why you didn &apos;t wanna testify .
it was a lot to ask .
and just let me know if you need any help or anything , really .
ok , thanks .
i &apos;m here to tutor jesus .
ok . i was just leaving .
jesus isn &apos;t here , but he should come back soon .
you can wait .
ok . thanks .
hey , can i ask you something ?
look , i know that i &apos;m leaving you hanging , and i &apos;m really sorry ,
but i just don &apos;t think that dance team is for me .
ok , but why not ?
you love dancing , it &apos;s completely obvious .
you smile just as big when you nail a turn
as when you solve one of craig &apos;s unsolvable coding problems .
so why are you letting a bunch of boys decide
what kind of girl you wanna be ?
i &apos;m not .
you say , &quot; that &apos;s just the way things are , &quot;
but , no , i don &apos;t accept that .
if things aren &apos;t the way they &apos;re supposed to be ,
then you have to change them , right ?
what if i told you i had an idea ,
a way that you can stay on dance team
and prove that you are without a doubt
the best coder in stem club ?
where &apos;s my bag ?
did anyone take my purse ?
did anyone see someone take my purse ? !
i realize i &apos;ve been saying this a lot recently ,
but you were right .
about what ?
craig asked me out .
i told you .
no gloating , please .
so , where are you going ?
we &apos;re not . i politely declined .
what ? why ? he &apos;s so cute ,
with that vaguely hawaiian hang @-@ ten super @-@ chill vibe .
true , but i think it &apos;s probably not a great idea
for me to date one of my subordinates .
besides , after my ex @-@ husband , i have a philosophy about men ,
they &apos;re like dessert .
when you want one , just think about it for a minute ,
and you &apos;ll realize you &apos;re probably better off going without .
what am i gonna do , huh ?
maybe i should try women .
oh , trust me , they &apos;re not any easier .
really ? i was sure they would be .
at least women know how to communicate .
not necessarily .
like my wife .
she has this almost compulsive need to keep things to herself .
and now we &apos;re gonna adopt this baby .
you are ?
and it &apos;s the right thing , i think it &apos;s the right thing , anyway ,
but i just hate that we &apos;re making big decisions like this
when we &apos;re not at our best , you know ?
i threw in a little something extra for the kids .
thanks . see you tomorrow .
i wanna talk to your wife .
no .
please . just for a minute .
no , i &apos;m sorry , you need to go .
mrs. gutierrez !
quiet , please .
what is it ?
what &apos;s going on ?
she was , uh ... she was just leaving .
i &apos;m not stupid , victor .
you look so much like her , when she was that age .
before all the drugs and the running away .
i &apos;m mariana .
i know .
mary ?
yeah .
oh , my god . that &apos;s realy nice . but it &apos;s fake , right ?
nope . no , no , real deal .
the serial number &apos;s right there on the tag .
yeah , that is beautiful .
how much did you want for it again ?
four hundred . it retails for nine .
that &apos;s a lot of money .
pretty bag like that will look real good on a pretty lady like you .
um , where &apos;d you get it ?
oh , it was a gift for my mom .
she said it was too fancy . and i can &apos;t return it .
ok , uh , yeah , i &apos;m gonna do it .
yeah ?
yeah .
all right , that &apos;s for you . three , four .
nice doing business with you .
you don &apos;t recognize me , do you ?
no , should i ?
yeah , i &apos;m callie jacob &apos;s mom .
and you &apos;re under arrest for fencing stolen goods .
mike ? !
going somewhere ?
not getting to know you and your brother
is the worst thing that &apos;s ever happened to me .
but i need you to hear me .
we didn &apos;t even know that you existed until it was too late .
ana never told us .
i think she thought because she was doing drugs
that we would try to take you away from her .
but of course , that &apos;s exactly what happened .
those government people came and took you .
and by the time we even heard of you ,
it was too late , you were already adopted .
and when we confronted her ,
when we asked her why , why would she let that happen ...
she said she was glad we couldn &apos;t get our hands on her children ,
so we couldn &apos;t make them suffer like she did .
she did a lot of bad things .
but we always tried , always forgave her .
but not that .
i couldn &apos;t forgive that .
would it change anything if i told you
that ana was sober ?
like really sober ?
and that maybe now you have a second chance ?
ana &apos;s pregnant .
me and jesus , we have a good life .
we &apos;re happy , we have a great family
and a great home , just so you know .
but i really think that you should read this .
and thank you for the christmas presents .
what christmas presents ?
how &apos;s it going ?
not good , liam &apos;s saying he had no idea
the bags were bought using a fake identity .
of course he is .
so ?
my favorite part was when he told me how badly he feels for you .
can &apos;t believe sarah would do this .
what a son @-@ of @-@ a @-@ bitch .
yeah , well , that &apos;s not the problem .
the most frustrating part is that sarah &apos;s saying the same thing .
what ?
yeah .
says that she &apos;s doing this all by herself ,
that liam has nothing to do with it .
she &apos;s protecting him again .
what , she &apos;s just gonna ruin her life for him ?
well , she &apos;s still a minor ,
so the punishment for her will be less severe , but ...
i just can &apos;t believe that she still doesn &apos;t understand
that he &apos;s just using her .
hey , can you check something for me ?
it &apos;s lou , you can leave a message ,
but i probably won &apos;t check it .
hey , uh , it &apos;s me .
um ... i wasn &apos;t gonna call ,
but , i , um , i just wanted to make sure you know ,
that yeah , i &apos;m dropping the tour ,
but i don &apos;t wanna drop you .
and if it felt that way when i told you , then ...
... i hate that .
and that &apos;s on me .
so let me know
if there &apos;s something i can do to make it up to you .
i never wanted you to think that .
ok , um ... well , call me back ,
i guess , if you want .
i went back .
to the bakery ?
they took the letter . said they &apos;d read it .
so we &apos;ll see .
you did good , mariana .
you did something to help that baby .
and i know it wasn &apos;t exactly what you wanted ,
but i &apos;m proud of you .
how ya been , callie ?
i &apos;ve been better , but , you know .
i sure am sorry about what sarah did .
i had no idea .
yeah , it &apos;s pretty messed up .
i just can &apos;t believe that
she still hasn &apos;t figured out that you &apos;re just using her ,
that you &apos;ve always been using her .
i tried to talk some sense into her ,
but she just loves you so much ,
she &apos;d do anything to protect you , you know ?
then i thought ...
... if there was just some way that we could prove to sarah
that she was being used , just like you used me .
and then it occurred to me ,
maybe we could check her credit report .
stef said , &quot; he &apos;s not that stupid , is he ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; no .
but he is that selfish . &quot;
turns out i was right .
you couldn &apos;t even wait
&apos;til you were done with her to use her credit .
you had some other girl , somewhere else ,
selling the stuff that you bought in sarah &apos;s name .
and when we showed her ,
well , turns out she doesn &apos;t love you quite
as much as she thought she did .
she told us the whole thing was your idea .
and she also told us about the sexual relationship .
so it looks like you &apos;re going to jail , liam ,
for a good , long time .
um , mike said that you left these at his place ?
i thought you might need them ?
oh , um , these aren &apos;t ... i have prescription ones .
hey , callie .
i ... i &apos;m so happy that you finally got that bastard .
me , too .
so now we get you off probation ,
and then , emancipation .
hey , is mom not here yet ?
where did she go after she dropped you off ?
i don &apos;t know , she just said she had an errand to run .
what ?
remember we decided not to tell the kids about the baby ?
well , we might wanna get on that .
