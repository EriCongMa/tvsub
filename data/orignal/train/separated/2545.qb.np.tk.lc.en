marge , i &apos;m heading out ! poker night !
i don &apos;t want you losing all our scrimpings !
don &apos;t worry , marge .
the real excitement for me is staying within a budget .
this is just a friendly game , right ?
oh , super friendly .
suckers .
dad , dad , dad .
i need two things : a good @-@ night hug and a favor .
to save time ,
i &apos;ll start describing the favor .
i &apos;ve just been accepted to the best band camp
this side of the mississippi !
which side are we again ?
doesn &apos;t matter ! it &apos;s a great camp .
notable graduates include pete barbutti .
pete barbutti ? !
yes ! anyway , it &apos;s a little pricey .
so , if you win big tonight ,
maybe you could help make a little girl really happy .
don &apos;t worry , sweetie , i &apos;m gonna win .
and you know why ?
i &apos;m wearing my lucky t @-@ shirt .
it was such a shame
he lost to president garfield .
oh , i &apos;ll fix this .

the maestro is here .
hey , who &apos;s the lady ?
what , are you kidding ?
this is laney fontaine , broadway legend .
she starred opposite al pacino
in does a tiger wear a necktie ?
now i date moe .
he &apos;s got everything i look for in a man :
a current liquor license .
well , it and you
are the two most precious wrinkled yellow things i know .
three of a kind beats two pair .
straight beats three of a kind .
three beats two .
four beats three .
oh , my god .
full house .
we &apos;re gonna win ! that means lisa goes to band camp .
as long as homer doesn &apos;t let them know
how good his hand is .
then he &apos;ll blow the whole damn thing to hell !
that would be terrible .
worst jammed @-@ in movie parody ever .
come on , homer . poker face .
aah ! stupid git !
i raise , no calls , pot goes to me .
hold on , fat folds five .
i see your raise , and i raise this .
is that real ?
won it for cinematography .
invented a new kind of steadicam that &apos;s mounted on a dog .
that &apos;s five grand to you .
so , are you in , or are you ...
while i &apos;m out , no one look at my cards or my boobs .
aw . don &apos;t she black out like an angel ?
queens beat jacks .
no one heard that . i &apos;m in .
okay , homer . moment of truth .
oh , four of a kind ! hey , honey , you won !
i lost .
i lost everything .
we &apos;re gonna celebrate , moe .
what &apos;s springfield &apos;s version of sardi &apos;s ?
uh , hardee &apos;s .
i know a nice booth under a picture of a hamburger .
aw , come on , homer . i &apos;ll drive you home .
hey , off we go !
vroom , vroom , vroom .
you &apos;ve completed poker : a beginner &apos;s guide .
now go out there and win .
i bid two bucks .
what was that ?
those aren &apos;t the tiptoes of a successful gambler .
how much did you lose ?
$ 5,000 .
whoa , i never heard that noise .
i &apos;m just sayin &apos; , doesn &apos;t look like
band camp is in the cards .
hey , this is my thing now .
so easy .
guys , i need help with a plan .
hey , what about a reverse mortgage ?
i saw a commercial for one where an old lady gave a thumbs @-@ up
and it turned into money , which filled up the screen .
the entire screen ?
swear to god .
hey , homer , here &apos;s a thought : invite laney over for dinner .
show her your crummy home , your unhappy kids .
anyone with a heart would take pity .
finally , my sucky life pays off .
do you guys think she &apos;ll buy it ?
oh , yeah . your whole house , uh , it smells like a basement .
i &apos;ve always hated your rugs .
yeah ... whoa , whoa , whoa .
why you have to go there , man ?
he has such beautiful floors .
why must he hide them ? why ?
there i am ,
on the main stage at caesar &apos;s ,
about to sing &quot; do you love me , &quot;
when who do i see sitting in the wings ?
your boyfriend king tut ?
no . jack jones .
high on his success from &quot; wives and lovers &quot;
with eyes for yours truly .
but you &apos;d just accepted a proposal from mike connors .
which i broke off .
let &apos;s just say mannix was the one man
i had to nix .
oh , that &apos;s rich !
oh , my god .
that &apos;s going in your book .
please tell me you &apos;re writing a book .
sit down , boy .
we &apos;re trying to show this dame
that we &apos;re deserving of her pity .
where &apos;s that crutch i gave you ?
there &apos;s nothing wrong with my leg .
there will be .
d &apos;oh !
ow , my leg !
oh ! oh , my leg .
who would take $ 5,000 from such a miserable creature ?
laney , i know it &apos;s your night off ,
but would you like to sing a song for us ?
you don &apos;t have to ask me twice .
* i &apos;m just a broadway lady *
* dancing on my aching feet *
* avoiding any foods with wheat *
* and no drinking pre @-@ show *
* it &apos;s okay if the producer don &apos;t know *
you know your way around a horn , kid .
oh , listen , i don &apos;t want to gush ,
but i have all your albums .
laney sings the blues ,
electric laney land ,
laney butchers the beatles .
ooh , and my favorite ,
rehab yourself a merry little christmas .
i &apos;ll tell you what , marge .
i &apos;ll wipe the slate clean on one condition .
i want you to give lisa to me .
uh , for a month or so .
i see .
get out . i never want to see you again .
let me explain .
listen , lady , you can &apos;t take a daughter
from a mother unless you &apos;re a bigger star
and this is a third @-@ world country .
marge ,
i know this sounds nuts ,
but i never had the joy you have .
a child to hug me at the end of the day
or @-@ or a chance to pass along what i know .
i &apos;m going out on tour ,
and she &apos;s got all the makings of a star :
talent , smarts and a star @-@ shaped head .
perhaps you didn &apos;t hear me .
here &apos;s your coat .
mom , mom .
mom , please .
you were gonna let me go to band camp for a month ,
where people break curfew and exchange reeds .
but this ? this is the opportunity to live my dream .
come on , how many chances in life do you get for that ?
none !
i &apos;ve been here , i &apos;ve just been quiet .
i guess i can &apos;t deny you this .
all right .
oh , thanks , mom !
and , mom , if you have any doubts how a showbiz kid will turn out ,
just look at all of them !
mom , i appreciate this so much .
you &apos;ll be the first person i thank at the tony &apos;s
after the great angela lansbury .
bye .

it &apos;s showtime , laney . time to see if there &apos;s still
a spark left in that smoldering duraflame log you call a career .
hey , laney .
moe , i need you .
to make me feel confident , strong and beautiful .
boy , i &apos;m not real good at boosting self @-@ esteem there .

cheering for someone getting a word right .
that is a low bar .
four tickets , please .
i &apos;m sorry , ma &apos;am . the show is sold out
for reasons that elude me .
my daughter &apos;s in there .
eh , we all got our problems .
i &apos;m a ticket seller for a dying art form .
hey , uh , you &apos;re a union man , right ?
brother ?
why didn &apos;t you say so ?
i have no choice now but to be corrupt .
in you go .
* everything &apos;s gonna be *
* bright lights and lollipops *
come on , let &apos;s sneak her out .
under the guise of soliciting for broadway cares .
wait . wait , homer .
look at our little girl .
she &apos;s got chops .
honest @-@ to @-@ goodness chops .
yeah . letting our daughter go on the road
with an 80 @-@ year @-@ old diva and some sketchy jazz guys
was the best decision we ever made .
* everything &apos;s coming up roses *
* for me and for you ! *
mom , that was the greatest night of my life !
when does the show start ?
it did , and it was wonderful .
eh , she &apos;s been bitten by the showbiz bug .
and when that happens , only working with bruce willis
can extinguish it .
okay . just finish out the tour .
we &apos;ll see you in pittsfield .
no way !
pittsfield ain &apos;t happening for this little scene stealer .
i love you , lisa , but you got a bigger ovation than me .
so we can never share the same stage again .
what ? how can you say that ?
showbiz lesson number seven :
just when things are going great ,
they pull the rug out from under you .
bad news , laney . we &apos;re shutting down .
never cleared the rights to &quot; everything &apos;s coming up roses . &quot;
see what i mean ?
also , we &apos;re gonna need that rug .
mom , suddenly i really want to go home .
if you go , let me give you one huge piece of advice :
take the eighth avenue side ,
then catch a cab and circle back .
and away ... i ... go !
well , laney , youse , uh ... you still got me .
see how gaudy his house is ?
a brass doorknocker ?
who lives here , caligula ?
&apos;tis troubling .
cousin jacob ! all the way from pennsyl @-@ diddly @-@ vania !
i see thou art still using the devil &apos;s &quot; diddly . &quot;
well , i must confess , i @-@ i do over @-@ diddly .
and i see your house is lit by edison &apos;s witch lights .
who &apos;s holier than thou now , ned ?
homer , you &apos;ve shown me that i &apos;m guilty of the sin of pride ,
and that just makes me love you more .
oh , god , i &apos;m stuck in a flandwich .
with side orders of love and forgiveness !
