ian doyle vanished from prison .
interpol can &apos;t find him .
am i in danger ?
we all are .
as far as doyle is concerned ,
lauren reynolds died in a car accident .
you died and we &apos;re all good .
how did he get past security checks ?
he chartered a private jet .
he used an alias . he sent me flowers ,
so i think it &apos;s safe to assume he &apos;s coming here .
hello , lauren .
oh , wait . lauren reynolds died in a car accident ,
didn &apos;t she ?
i was doing my job .
you took the only thing that mattered to me .
so i &apos;m going to take the only thing that matters to you--
your life .
a strong storm is expected to hit the eastern seaboard
within the next 72 hours .
could be a bad one .
let &apos;s see how it &apos;s looking right now .
now , what we have is an area of low pressure
that &apos;s getting stronger and moving off the eastern seaboard .
then comes the fear of damage ...
30 on the dot , as promised .
and at the same time , another heavy snowfall event
will create travel chaos
and power outages throughout the district .
cold air moves in ...
getting ready for the storm . can you believe it ?
hey , i &apos;m talking to you !
don &apos;t make me come and get you .
i used to fit into this .
i blame your cooking .
it &apos;s just too damn fine .
like your ass .
now let &apos;s go . we &apos;re late .
frank ? honey , you ok ?
frank ?
frank !
i love you .
please , please , my family has done nothing to you .
please , i beg you . why are you doing this ?
please , my son . my son . let my son go .
he &apos;s innocent .
bonsoir .
you ok ?
ian doyle is here in d.c.
how can you be so sure ?
i sat next to him last night .
what ?
he said if i warned my team or told anyone , he &apos;d kill them .
why didn &apos;t he kill you ?
and more to the point , why didn &apos;t you kill him ?
he &apos;s not working alone .
then he &apos;s just playing with you .
no , no , he &apos;s a power assertive psychopath . he doesn &apos;t play games .
he &apos;s meticulous . he plans everything down to the last detail .
yeah , that last detail being you .
maybe you should tell your team .
no . no way . this isn &apos;t their fight .
and i won &apos;t take that risk .
we stay together , we can get him .
we already tried .
look how that ended up .
wait . wait . when you went undercover ,
i promised no one would harm you .
i &apos;m not undercover anymore .
d.c. isn &apos;t his comfort zone , it &apos;s mine .
this ends here .
two d.c. homes torched , two families , on the same night ,
last night .
i &apos;m surprised it still hasn &apos;t hit the news .
it &apos;s already mid @-@ day .
yeah . all anyone &apos;s talking about
is this storm that may or may not hit .
i managed to find an online article about the fires
written by this guy jeff hastings ,
but no one &apos;s running with it .
how strange . they usually thrive on tragedy .
yeah , and it gets weirder .
ron and lauren cosenza and their 10 @-@ year @-@ old son
were found in the master bedroom of their home ,
each shot through the forehead .
the gun belonged to the father .
murder @-@ suicide ?
well , it looks like metro p.d. &apos; s investigation is going that way ,
but it &apos;s still the first 48 . they want our help .
kerry and frank fagan , like the cosenzas ,
were found in their master bedroom from a suspected gas leak .
it had to be massive to cause that .
how does the news miss a house explosion ?
any connection between the families ?
only one . a continent .
kerry fagan was born in germany ,
ron cosenza is from italy .
so 2 of the 5 victims are from europe . how does that help ?
it doesn &apos;t . i &apos;m just stating the facts ,
and the facts happen to be--
guys , i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late .
you ok ?
yeah , it &apos;s just one of those weeks , i guess .
i &apos;m sorry . what did i miss ? arsonist ?
one appears to be murder @-@ suicide , the other a freak accident .
so why are we looking at it ?
house fires are rare . add to that a few miles apart ,
within the same hour ,
kind of tips the scales of coincidence .
yeah , if somebody did this ,
they &apos;re highly motivated and organized .
and if he wants to strike again ,
he &apos;s got 72 hours before the storm shuts the city down .
what &apos;s his name ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
oh , answering a question with a question . that &apos;s interesting .
stop it .
stop what , probing ?
seriously .
i &apos;m gonna make it my life &apos;s work
to find out who this boy is--
stop . just stop .
we have enough to worry about already , don &apos;t we ?
lao tzu said , &quot; when i let go of what i am , &quot;
&quot; i become what i might be . &quot;
ok , thanks .
that was weird . they &apos;re not coming .
there was some mix @-@ up with metro p.d.
and we &apos;re on our own .
what do you got ?
well , the fire didn &apos;t spread
because they had hard @-@ wired smoke alarms
and a sprinkler system .
what &apos;s with the security .
why the steel door ? what did he do for a living ?
oh , computer networking ,
and the fagans were financial advisors .
these neighborhoods don &apos;t require anything
more than an average deadbolt ,
certainly nothing on the bedroom doors .
it &apos;s like a panic room .
yeah , but there &apos;s nothing in this room that &apos;s high tech .
there &apos;s no surveillance cameras , average alarm system .
in an average area .
but he had a 40 @-@ caliber and a load of locks .
what was this guy afraid of ?
or who .
maybe himself .
if he actually killed his family ,
then he &apos;s been hiding something .
there is no history of any kind of psychological weirdness
with either family . they were healthy , happy , fit .
until last night .
any signs of financial stress ?
no . they were healthy on that front , too .
what &apos;s with the ...
oh . the heat is out in my lair .
not a single snowflake has fallen
and yet the weather remains the top news story .
nothing about these cases ?
no . they &apos;re bound to get hip to it .
once our presence is felt
and we connect the cases ,
it &apos;ll be a ballroom blitz .
what is it ?
you know , considering the time these fires occurred ,
the habitual patterns of both families
were in direct conflict with where the bodies were found .
the master bedroom .
yeah , normally lauren cosenza would be downstairs
helping her son with his homework ,
and ron wouldn &apos;t even be home from work yet .
what about the fagans ?
their routines were less established .
they traveled a lot . but they were expected
at a dinner party last night .
if someone did this , what are the chances
these victims are random ?
what do you think ?
two families , same night , mysterious deaths .
doesn &apos;t happen every day .
the gas leak at the fagan house
and then the other fire suspected to be set
by mr. cosenza to cover the murder @-@ suicide .
well , i know the investigators reported that ,
but it doesn &apos;t fit with what i found .
the cosenza family didn &apos;t have any smoke in their lungs .
he killed them , set the fire ,
then killed himself . that fits .
he didn &apos;t have signs of smoke inhalation either .
even though the fire started in the master bedroom ?
he should have had traces of smoke ,
even if it was a minute
before he pulled the trigger on himself .
he was dead when the fire started .
garcia hasn &apos;t found any connection between the victims .
there has to be one .
on paper they &apos;re perfect .
everything &apos;s clean .
but what happened to them last night was anything but .
you ok ?
people text like it &apos;s not as intrusive
as a phone call .
you know , you haven &apos;t had a vacation in a while .
weren &apos;t you talking about italy ?
my mother extended her trip there .
it wouldn &apos;t be much of a vacation .
it &apos;s a big country .
not big enough .
well , think about it .
i will .
and pick a place where that thing won &apos;t work .
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry .
i thought you were in there .
are you ok ?
yeah , i &apos;m--i &apos;m--
i &apos;m sure these vtims overlap somehow .
garcia pulled their phone numbers ,
but so far i can &apos;t find anything .
you just jumped .
i &apos;ve been having these really intense headaches lately .
have you seen a doctor ?
yeah , a few . none of them have been able to figure it .
oh . i &apos;m ... sorry .
does anyone know ?
you .
i won &apos;t tell anyone .
i know . they &apos;d just worry .
not that you &apos;re not gonna worry ,
but they &apos;ll just make me feel like a baby .
you know ?
i do .
how are you ?
i &apos;m good .
you &apos;ve been picking your fingernails again .
yeah .
you only do that when you &apos;re stressed .
it &apos;s just a bad habit .
you coming ?
yeah . i &apos;ll be there in a minute .
the media blitz i promised never came .
the original online article
written by a one mr. jeff hastings--pulled .
so with your permission , sir , i would like to track him down
and figure out what the hell is going on .
what &apos;s the connection ?
it &apos;s a small one .
both families coach soccer on the hill .
the fagans didn &apos;t have children .
no . but kerry fagan coached her godson &apos;s team .
the two victims from europe were the soccer coaches .
it makes sense , doesn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m beginning to think that they &apos;ve crossed paths before .
i ran the victims &apos; phone numbers .
they never contacted each other ,
but there is a common number between them .
give it .
uh , 703 @-@ 555 @-@ 0118 .
byron delaney , his wife grace died last summer ,
children grown .
what do you know ? he &apos;s british .
garcia , send me the address . i &apos;ll grab prentiss .
sent .
so what &apos;s your take on these guys ?
they &apos;re contradicting themselves ,
exposing bodies but then going through all of this to hide it .
do you think they wanted us on the case ?
us , the bau ? why would they ?
ego . control .
some kind of agenda .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re even on their radar , prentiss . do you ?
you &apos;re right .
why would we be ?
put the shoe back on .
hold up .
what is it ?
black fella and a woman . white .
are they alone ?
yeah
is it her ?
yeah .
you sure this is it ?
maybe nobody &apos;s home .
garcia never got an answer .
prentiss , get down !
move ! move !
keep moving .
look out !
let &apos;s go .
get in the van .
no ! wait !
go , go , go , go !
well , this is one story that &apos;s not gonna get buried .
he &apos;s just a kid . he can &apos;t be more than 25 .
a kid with an assault weapon isn &apos;t just a kid anymore .
4 rounds total .
that one &apos;s yours . you hit his femoral artery .
he was dead and they knew it .
bet he didn &apos;t bargain on that when he signed up .
he &apos;s got 2 shots to the head
and then one in the wrist . why the wrist ?
to make sure he can &apos;t return fire ?
he was dead before his head hit the sidewalk .
prentiss .
he &apos;s got a tattoo , at least what &apos;s left of one .
they blew a hole through the tattoo
because we could have i.d. &apos; d him .
so they &apos;re confident we can &apos;t i.d. his face or prints .
no gsws , no signs of strangulation .
dave .
his shoe &apos;s untied .
injected between the toes .
made to look like a heart attack .
armor tech windows ,
6 @-@ pin locks on the entrance door .
same as the fagans and the cosenzas .
20,000 in cash .
passport . this guy was on the move .
outgoing calls .
3218 . that &apos;s kerry fagan .
10 : 30 a.m.
10 : 31 , delaney calls the cosenzas .
both calls last only seconds .
didn &apos;t leave a message . didn &apos;t try to warn them .
somebody warned him .
if not on the phone then in person .
whatever these victims have in common
or whatever they were a part of ...
didn &apos;t happen on u.s. soil .
3 of the 6 victims are from europe .
and the mini beryl says they &apos;re serious .
we saw how they move .
they &apos;ve got be ex @-@ military .
european hit squad cleaning house ?
it &apos;s happened before .
they could have taken us out--easily .
why didn &apos;t they ?
fbi agents gunned down in d.c.
would have definitely started a war .
a war this kid wasn &apos;t prepared for .
he &apos;s just a foot soldier .
whoever shot him is the leader .
someone must have warned byron delaney to get out .
and whoever it is is next on the list .
thank you .
&quot; the helmsman &apos;s wife . &quot;
i just finished it . it &apos;s so sad .
i just started it .
oh ! sorry . it &apos;s a great read to that bit .
the end , the sad bit , with the wife ,
super tragic . you know ?
i do now .
you &apos;re jeff , right ?
you are ...
penelope garcia . nice to see you .
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t think we &apos;ve met .
oh , we haven &apos;t .
i &apos;ve with the fbi .
good for you .
why did you pull that story ?
you should know .
the fbi didn &apos;t tell you to pull it , did they ?
no , no , no , i &apos;m not saying jack to you .
you already ruined one ending for me .
listen , two families died in those fires .
you were suspicious and you were right to be .
you don &apos;t look like an agent to me .
i &apos;m a ... hired nerd
for the behavioral analysis unit .
you think it &apos;s a serial killer ?
i think that theory
should be at the beginning part of your story .
there &apos;s no story .
not the one that i want to tell .
ok , maybe not now , but when whoever is telling you to pull it
is no longer a threat ,
with the right source it could be front page .
it could be the next watergate . it could lead to a book .
your book .
the threat being to the shareholders .
shareholders that are affected detrimentally ?
i think you mean financially .
follow the money ?
oh , that sounds like a very good ending .
for you , i mean .
yes , it does .
reid , you got anything ?
the damage is pretty extensive ,
but luckily some of the tattoo remains .
seaver , get the victim &apos;s photo out to the press .
i think i know who dug the hole .
the journo told me to follow the money ,
like straight up , that &apos;s what he told me , so i did .
it turns out &quot; the gazette &quot; is owned by a multinational
global conglomerate-- oil , new technologies , shipping ,
air and ground transportation ,
all of which employ the services
of one company--cws .
clear water securities ?
you know them ?
i &apos;ve come across them .
they &apos;re a private counterintelligence group out of geneva .
ron cosenza , byron delaney , kerry fagan
all worked for cws .
how long ago ?
7 years ago .
seaver , hang up .
do we have a problem ?
well , cws does .
got it .
what &apos;s going on ?
are you ok ?
yeah , i &apos;m good .
i &apos;m not a profiler , but you--
don &apos;t start .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m gonna be all right .
ok .
i &apos;m just really worried about you .
i think the flu is going around .
are you pregs ?
no . no .
no , i &apos;m just not sleeping .
i &apos;m having this nightmare .
it &apos;s a recurring nightmare .
there &apos;s a hill , and there &apos;s a little girl
on top of the hill .
she &apos;s like 6 years old ,
dark hair .
and she &apos;s just dancing in the sun .
but somehow i know that she &apos;s waiting for me ,
so i start to walk up the hill ...
but the hill gets steeper and steeper ,
and by the time i climb to the top ,
the little girl &apos;s gone .
and i look everywhere for her ,
and when i can &apos;t find her ,
i start to panic .
and i panic because i know
what &apos;s waiting out there for her .
i know what the world can do to a girl
who only sees beauty .
like you .
somehow you always make me smile .
and i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever thanked you for that .
hotch needs you in the scif .
绝密会议室
exactly why did you bring us here ?
and why is the bau interested in cws ?
why did you pull that story ?
that &apos;s how you remember them .
and that is now they are now .
you warned your friend byron delaney .
you knew him the longest . it &apos;s too bad you were too late .
if you &apos;re looking for reactions , this is our business .
business ?
ugly as that sounds .
kerry fagan , ron cosenza , and byron delaney ,
they all worked for cws .
as do 40,000 other subcontractors all over the world .
so they were subcontracted to you .
if you &apos;re looking for answers ,
take it up with the main contractor .
and that would be ?
your government .
whoever is killing these families
holds your company responsible , not the government .
we run operations from the middle east to antarctica .
going over them all will take months .
so you &apos;ve already started investigations ?
that &apos;s why you pulled the story .
the cases these people were involved in are protected
by a multinational official secrets agreement .
even if i wanted to--
these people were killed on u.s. soil
by trained suspects who fired on federal agents .
as a courtesy and out of respect
for the predicament your company now faces ,
everything in this room is off the record .
however , outside this room ,
if you withhold information about the case ,
you and your company will be held fully accountable .
all right . what do you know ?
we &apos;re looking for a european team ,
with considerable training .
and for one of them , it &apos;s personal .
why do you think that ?
because they could have spared the child , but they chose not to .
the killing of samuel cosenza by one of the team was personal .
one of the attackers shot last night
had the remains of a tattoo on his wrist .
on the surface the tattoo
may look like a simple four @-@ leaf clover .
but the stem has a &quot; v &quot; at the end .
we believe this is associated
with a hidden sect of fallen warriors .
it &apos;s also the name of a ship
famous for its journeys from dublin to america ,
the &quot; valhalla . &quot;
have you seen that before ?
we ran an operation to capture the leader
of a breakaway ira faction years ago .
he assumed that moniker .
what &apos;s his name ?
happy birthday , my love .
his mug is all over the place .
he &apos;s not gonna be able to get out of the district
unless he sprouts wings himself .
it &apos;s not that i &apos;m not happy that we have his name ,
but how are we supposed to know who &apos;s on his list ?
we study his life
and every single person he &apos;s ever come in contact with .
look , doyle &apos;s been away for 7 years ,
but he still managed to figure out who the players were .
maybe we should start with how he got out of prison .
well , where was he locked up ?
russia , i think .
actually , there are no extradition papers on him .
was doyle on your radar when you were at interpol ?
uh , sure , i had heard of him , but direct contact ?
i &apos;d have to ask around .
do .
good guys and bad keep files close to them .
what are in these files ?
it &apos;s intel .
insurance . protection . for times like this .
maybe i should go to byron
delaney &apos;s house and see what i can find .
take prentiss with you . she might have some insight .
no one &apos;s getting back to you ?
i only have a couple of contacts , but they &apos;ll get back to me .
what , are we being followed , 007 ?
no , but you should go through the city .
66 is gonna be miserable right now .
we &apos;ll get there .
oh , before doyle takes somebody else out ?
he &apos;s shooting up federal agents .
what &apos;s he gonna do next ?
what would you like me to do ?
get creative with your driving .
i &apos;m working on it , prentiss .
hey . thanks for getting back .
i need some intel on ian doyle .
are you alone ?
not at all . anything you can spare .
is your team in danger ?
absolutely .
you should start with our victims ,
ron cosenza , kerry fagan , byron delaney .
see if they connect to doyle in any way .
i &apos;ll send you a document .
i &apos;ll be waiting for it . thanks .
they got something ?
i don &apos;t know . we &apos;ll see .
you know , emily , you really need to trust people .
i trust people .
no , you don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t because you can &apos;t .
and i get it . every time you tried to count on someone ,
they let you down , so you go it alone .
you &apos;ll never admit that
because you &apos;re just too damn stubborn .
it &apos;s all right . it doesn &apos;t really matter .
but i &apos;ll tell you what does matter .
that you can trust me , emily .
with anything .
i &apos;m serious .
no matter how awful you think it is ,
i promise you , you are not alone .
i just wish you &apos;d believe that .
i do .
you profile me again , you &apos;ll wish you hadn &apos;t .
the more players we get on this board ,
the sooner erin will get her nose in it .
strauss already knows .
i &apos;m surprised she wasn &apos;t in the scif .
she &apos;s on vacation .
oh , great . now she &apos;ll never take another one .
is everything about this guy classified ?
somebody knows him .
we just haven &apos;t found them yet .
there &apos;s a safe in the bedroom .
behind a big painting ?
yeah , it &apos;s not gonna be in there .
it &apos;s gonna be somewhere where he can sit
and still gain access to it .
and he &apos;s gotta be quick .
get outta here .
that &apos;s dreyer .
kerry fagan , ron cosenza .
delaney &apos;s not in it .
why would he have that picture ?
maybe he was their handler .
here &apos;s the million @-@ dollar question--
anyone know what language that is ?
those are villages in north korea .
i love you .
of course she does .
there &apos;s a political prison near haengyong @-@ ni .
camp 22 . kwan @-@ li @-@ so .
north korea denies it exists .
you think they took doyle there ?
that would explain why he &apos;s after them .
even his prison is off the grid .
all we know is that he was never married ,
had multiple residences ,
and was arrested at his tuscan villa .
there &apos;s paperwork to back that up ?
and a list of who was there that day .
there may be photographs .
reid &apos;s looking into that now .
right . so those people
need to be warned that he &apos;s on the warpath .
they have been .
but there &apos;s a whole different life he &apos;s led ,
one that isn &apos;t in any file .
prentiss , did you hear from your european associates ?
i &apos;m waiting for them to send me a document .
we need it now .
he &apos;s locked in this hellhole for 7 years .
how did he get out ?
does it really matter ?
doyle was in kwan @-@ li @-@ so ?
ah . well , that was on a need @-@ to @-@ know .
you didn &apos;t think i needed to know that ?
are you kidding me ?
and what good would that do ?
you don &apos;t get to decide what &apos;s good for me anymore .
what else aren &apos;t you telling me ?
that &apos;s it .
you said he was in russia .
no , actually , sean mcallister told you that .
tsia ?
yeah .
get him off the phone .
what are you gonna do , em ?
huh ? what are you gonna do ? you gonna run away ?
yeah , you &apos;re good at that .
tsia .
bloody hell .
ok .
you can &apos;t trust him .
you have got to get out of there right now .
you are safer on your own .
do you remember 9th street ? corelli &apos;s . how the door works ?
yeah .
he &apos;s still there .
you will be in and out in 5 minutes .
got it .
do not let clyde follow you .
and , tsia , be careful .
you , too .
fine .
hey , what &apos;s that ?
uh , oh , this is the only lead i have so far .
what about you ? seaver said you were looking for photos
of , uh , doyle &apos;s tuscan villa ?
i couldn &apos;t find any stills from the day he was arrested ,
but there may be some surveillance footage from the sedans .
they generally record everything .
yeah ?
you get a document from your contacts ?
bank accounts traceable to our first two victims .
we might be able to match the rest of those faces .
good .
what else have you found ?
ok , look in the peephole .
my mother made it .
christmas .
that journalist is eating out of my hand .
he had no idea i was promising him a full @-@ fledged manhunt .
it &apos;s way more than that . i &apos;ve counted reps from 5 agencies .
oh , i love me and multi @-@ agency taskforcing ,
and on our turf . it gets my blood up .
when are we going to get started ?
oh , he &apos;s drawing up the battle plan with the troops .
what &apos;s holding us up ?
we &apos;re waiting for somebody from d.c.
metro police , then we can start .
who &apos;s got updates on roadblocks ?
they will . all parkways and interstates in d.c. ,
maryland , and virginia have station checkpoints .
doyle has the means to get in and out of the country .
what makes you think he won &apos;t get out of the district ?
it &apos;s the best we &apos;ve got right now .
metro got held up . double homicide on k and 9th .
they want me to take a look .
doyle ?
vic &apos;s apartment looks like a black market forger .
the other victim ?
a woman , 30s , no i.d. , outside his door .
i &apos;m coming with you .
go .
hey . you sure you want to leave ?
we &apos;re only passing through .
but she &apos;s the one .
you just gonna leave her ?
think she &apos;ll follow us ?
me . she &apos;ll follow me .
why ?
because she must .
this guy took 2 in the chest .
he went quickly .
one straight to the forehead .
the holes were made by a .45 .
so she comes to the door ,
and he shoots her .
she didn &apos;t stand a chance .
this has to be the work of our guy .
she might be on our list . we should run her prints .
i need some air .
what did you do , pull a whiskey pete &apos;s ?
uh , i don &apos;t know what that means .
but if it involves getting vomit on your boots ,
then , yeah , i &apos;m guilty .
you need a soda ? what can i do ?
i live 10 minutes from here . can we just swing by ?
&apos;cause i think i got it on my pants , too .
hotch wants us to get back .
i know . i &apos;ll be really quick , i promise .
ok .
it &apos;d be so easy to take her out here and now .
she hasn &apos;t confessed yet .
all roads coming and going are blocked .
if we don &apos;t make it out of here , she wins again .
have a little faith .
it &apos;s not often that we know a subject &apos;s name ,
and in this case , knowing ian doyle &apos;s
identity doesn &apos;t give us very much .
he &apos;s known to a select few , and those who know him well
either work beside him or they &apos;re on his list .
2 or 3 of his victims worked for cws
and were responsible for his transport to north korea .
there were 7 operatives on the mission altogether ,
and the remaining 5 have been warned .
all the federal and international agents
responsible for tracking him down
are now on his list of targets .
we &apos;ll find doyle the way we find any other offender--
by studying his behavior .
we &apos;ll dissect his every move since he regained his freedom .
when he escaped from north korea ,
he killed a man and he used his vehicle
to cross the border into russia .
you good ?
i &apos;m good .

&quot; confession is always weakness .
&quot; the grave soul keeps its own secrets
and takes its own punishment in silence . &quot;
