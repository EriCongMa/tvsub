You were gonna tell her you love her.
I kept trying to make it go away,
but how do you kill a feeling?
You're one of the good ones, you know?
Just because Louis is the father of your baby
does not mean you should be with him.
You should be with me.
Why?
Because I'm going to love your baby
as much as I love you.
Whoa. Are those paparazzi?
Look at them.
Oh, my god!
Carol, it's me, Ivy.
I'm leaving tonight.
This time I'm not coming back.
If "Gossip girl" didn't exist,
Chuck and Blair would not be in the hospital right now,
fighting for their lives.
I wanna take "Gossip Girl" down for good.
I think we should use the "Spectator" to do it.
Blair is awake and responsive.
And Chuck?
Louie? What are you doing out here in the rain?
I hadn't noticed.
I hadn't realized you and Blair
had returned from Europe already.
Been back for three weeks. I'm surprised you didn't know.
One of the downsides of not having "Gossip girl" these last few months.
Any information would have to come
from Blair speaking to me directly, which she hasn't.
She's been busy.
I'm very sorry she lost the baby.
Is she all right?
Seems to be.
She spends all her hours planning the wedding.
Well, I, uh, I can't very well let you get sick
before your big day. Come on. I'll walk you home.
I'll be fine.
Look, I know we've had our differences.
Are you really going to pass up the offer of an umbrella
on a night like this?
Thank you.
Shouldn't you be at some scandalous party
the night before New Year's eve?
I haven't really been in a party mood.
Well, at least you've fully recovered from the accident.
Physically.
Go find Dorota. Have her dry you off.
Thanks for letting us up while we wait for my car.
It's the least I can do after you saved me from the monsoon.
I'll go get us some towels.
Louis?
Dorota's obviously become lax in announcing visitors.
There's no need to reprimand the help. Louis invited me in.
I should have known you'd manipulate someone.
How can you blame me? You won't respond to my texts or calls.
I just wanted to be there for you
after the baby.
Well, as you can see,
I survived without you.
And I intend to continue that way,
so you should go.
That's it? I'm just cut out of your life
without any explanation?
My New York wedding is in less than a month.
I have to keep my priorities in order.
We were your priority.
What happened, Blair?
What changed after the accident?
Did it ever occur to you
that there's no such thing as an accident?
Well, it certainly felt like one when the car hit the wall.
Or it was the universe's way of pointing out
what's really important.
How can you say we weren't important?
We were the only thing that matters.
Well, you're obviously not leaving, so I will.
Tell Louis Bergdorf's stayed open late
so I can finish our registry.
I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.
I...
I love you, Chuck.
I love you, too, Blair.
Chuck? Are you all right?
Yes. Thank you.
Blair said to, uh, tell you she's gone
to pick out china patterns.
At this hour?
I'm sure it's just her excuse to avoid me.
I wish that were true.
But these excursions have become quite regular.
Well, is that why you were out in the rain--
looking for her?
I just wanna know what she's doing.
Have you asked Serena?
Blair is not sharing anything with her.
She doesn't even let Dorota accompany her.
To be honest, I thought she might be back with you.
Well, as you can see, my presence only made her flee.
I'm thinking of hiring a detective.
I need to know the woman I'm about to marry
isn't having an affair.
Well, we're both here,
so who else can she possibly be cheating with?
Hello, Daniel.
What are you doing here in Brooklyn?
In the--in the rain at night?
I was in the neighborhood
checking in on my Brooklyn holdings,
And I wanted to make sure
you hadn't fallen into another literary slump.
Yeah, I've been holed up trying to figure out a concept
for my new book, and it's great that they gave me a deal
for a second one, but that means I-I actually have to come up
with something to write about, so, uh...
I should probably get back to failing at that.
Of course.
Did you know Blair was back in town?
No. I mean, I-I-I live in Brooklyn.
Without "Gossip girl," I know nothing.
I assume losing the baby made her realize
she loved Louis after all.
He doesn't think so. He thinks Blair might be having an affair.
What? No, that's insane.
How would you know? You said you hadn't seen her.
Well, I just mean that after everything Blair's been through,
It doesn't make sense.
Love doesn't make sense,
and neither does Blair's behavior right now.
Louis is considering hiring a private investigator.
Well, I hope you talked him out of that.
I did. I think you'd make a much better choice.
Chuck, I'm not gonna spy on Blair.
Why? You know her well enough
to know if she's hiding something.
Unless there's a reason
you don't want the truth to come out.
No, that's not it. Of course I do.
Then I look forward to a full report.
Chuck can never know the truth.
Hey, happy almost new year.
I hope you're coming to the "Spectator" Party tonight.
Well, after Nate finally forgave me
for diminishing him to half a Derek in my book,
I'm not gonna miss this chance to support him.
Good, then you can help me with my year in review lists.
I need "biggest transformation."
Oh. Um... How about you?
From busting Ben out of prison
to being the biggest blogger in new york city,
complete with cool new computer?
Oh, well, you can thank "Gossip girl" disappearing for that.
People are just desperate for information,
even if it's just about me
and my lack of new year's date.
Well, I'm sure that will make all the men at the party
supremely happy.
Have you seen Blair? Is she around?
Uh, she's not. Were you supposed to meet her?
No. No, I just heard she was back in town.
I wondered how she was doing.
Well, I wish I knew. She's been keeping to herself lately.
She wouldn't even let me go with her
to Vera Wang for her gown fitting.
Nate, hey, were you waiting downstairs?
I'm sorry. I'm almost ready.
Oh, good. We just need to meet the caterer.
Hey, dan, glad to see ya.
You know, "Inside" didn't make it into
our year's best book list.
I'm sorry, dude.
Well, it's probably best to keep it in 2011.
It's a new year, new book.
What's this one about?
I don't know yet, which could be
why I haven't started writing it.
You should consider, um, having it set in Alaska
or maybe make it a period piece?
I vote for anything you don't have to write
behind your friends' backs.
Listen, even if it's about frankenstein in the old west,
I promise you full disclosure.
Sounds like a new year's resolution to me.
Let's go.
You wanna walk out with us?
Yeah, sure, I've-- I've got an errand to run.
I get it.
Alexa Chung is a better invite than your dad.
Well, have fun. But not too much fun.
Bye.
Jenny sends her love from london.
Oh, it was so nice to have her and Eric home for christmas.
Oh, no. Not the sad empty nest face already.
No, it's not that.
It's just that I hoped that Charlie might surprise us
with a visit, or at least a call.
She made it pretty clear that life in the upper east side
was too much for her.
Well, I can understand, with the press at her party
and the paparazzi chasing charles and blair.
But we were so close.
I just wish she had said good-bye.
She didn't want to upset you after the accident.
She was a wreck, Lil. She knows what she wants.
Well, I would feel better hearing that from her.
Every time I call Carol,
she says that Charlie's just run out.
You cannot blame me for not trusting my sister
to tell me what's really going on.
And Carol's crazy, but she does love her daughter.
And we both agree that pushing Charlie to talk to us
would be a mistake.
I know. I just hope she's okay.
There you are.
You know how many brides I had to peek in on to find you?
Yes, it is possible to lose too much weight before the wedding.
Not you, though. You look perfect.
I can't get married in this dress.
I'm sorry.
All right, let's get you out of it, then.
It's beautiful, but...
Vera designed it for me before the accident,
And now... All I see is everything I lost.
Seriously, what is the point
Of making these things so tiny and complicated?
It's too late anyway.
Do you know how many months of work went into this beading?
A bride can't just change her mind
weeks before the wedding.
Yes, she can, and she can also change her mind
about marrying Louis.
Nice try, but I told you I'm committed to him,
and nothing's gonna change that.
Is everything okay in here, Blair?
Of course.
You are an artist.
But she... needs to get married in a different dress.
I had a feeling,
so I pulled some wonderful choices.
Thank you for being so understanding.
I'll go get the dresses from the back.
Now... what did you burst in on my emotional moment
to yell at me about?
Oh, it can wait until after you find the right dress.
Hello?
Remember how you asked me to call you
when Blair came in for her fitting?
She's here with a guy who's not the prince,
and he's not a gay stylist.
Let me guess-- dark, curly hair
with the pale visage of someone who doesn't get out much.
That's him.
Thank you.
We need to move this stakeout to Vera Wang.
Most surreal New York moment?
The earthquake.
Or Paz De La Huerta.
What's up with your e-mail?
I thought the R.S.V.P.s were going to my assistant.
Ever since "Gossip girl" went into hiding,
people have been sending their blasts to me.
Serena, there are thousands of unread messages here.
Yeah, I hoped if I ignored them long enough,
people would get the point, and I guess they haven't.
I thought you wanted gossip girl
to pay for causing Chuck and Blair's crash.
But the police didn't press charges.
What else can we do except settle for her silence?
You call that silence?
That's the sound of the entire upper east side sending you their blasts.
If you don't start posting them,
they'll go back to gossip girl or someone worse.
My blog is about my own experience,
not using information to hurt people.
Yeah, well, the least you can do is read them.
You don't think it's too simple?
Why am I even asking your opinion on fashion?
And why are you not responding?
What stopped your never-ending soliloquy?
You said I wasn't allowed to question
your marrying Louis, so...
Oh. Then you may resume your silence.
Blair, we are lying to all the people we care about.
Which is fine, when it's for their own good.
I'm not sure that it is.
Look, Chuck and Louis are already suspicious.
Don't you think it'd be better
to tell them before they find out on their own?
How would they do that?
The only ones who know are you, me, and god,
and god doesn't blab.
I don't know how much longer I can keep this secret.
Forever. You promised.
I don't know if I can live with those consequences.
Look, I know our situation is far from ideal,
but don't go all "Notebook" on me, not now.
I need you.
Hey, you have me. All right?
So put Weiner as worst political blunder and worst photo.
Could you see who that is, please?
It's a text. Doesn't say who from.
"I thought you were a journalist with integrity?"
Maybe Anthony Weiner has your office bugged.
Yeah. Or someone else we did a story on isn't happy.
"Not important. The important thing is
that the paparazzi didn't cause Blair and Chuck's accident."
"I did my research. Do yours."
I thought I'd check in, see how your sleuthing is going.
Well, I've uncovered the fact that Blair's wedding dress,
Uh, fits like a glove, you know?
I think the only person she's seeing covertly is Vera Wang.
Anything else to report?
No, just, uh, just shopping for some wedding stuff,
bossy phone calls to Dorota. You know, that's it.
Well, if you're sure,
the mission need not be continued.
Thank you for your diligent effort.
Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't find any more answers.
Louis, you were right about Blair.
We need to talk.
Hey, Louis,
Any luck convincing Blair to come to the party tonight?
Not yet. She's said no to every invitation
since we returned to New York.
I'm afraid new year's eve will be no different.
Louis, Serena, it's nice to see you.
Chuck, what are you doing here?
I came to tell Louis he was right.
Blair is having an affair...
with your ex.
I'm referring to Dan, not the myriad of men since.
What are you talking about?
Dan said he hasn't even seen blair
since she got back from Europe.
He lied to you, just as he lied to me.
When he said Blair was shopping for wedding trinkets,
he was with her.
You followed them?
After you told me not to hire a detective?
You obviously have your own agenda where Blair's concerned.
Which is why... I had my driver take a picture.
Just because Dan lied about seeing Blair
doesn't mean that they're sleeping together.
It's a private residence.
Blair has a key. What else are they doing there?
It does explain her absences.
Yeah, but that's not proof,
which is what you guys need if you're gonna gang up
and accuse her of cheating,
especially after everything that she's been through.
Gossip girl probably has a treasure trove
of photos in her in-box.
But they come to me now,
and I'm not gonna use them to destroy people's lives.
If they're innocent, it won't destroy anyone.
He's right.
What's the harm of looking through the blasts
if there's nothing to see?
If that's how you wanna spend your New Year's Eve,
go ahead. Knock yourselves out.
And I hope you'll focus on getting your fiancee
to come to the party tonight.
She could really use a night out with people
who care about her.
Hello? Andrew. Lily just went upstairs.
Can I help you?
I'm sorry. I thought this was a personal call.
I didn't realize she'd asked you to look into something.
Yeah, I understand that your work is confidential.
I'll let her know you called.
How about "Cupcake War"
as the most addictive new food show?
Are those from the night of the accident?
Yeah. That anonymous texter might be right.
Can't tell from these paparazzi pictures
if the photographers were even close enough
to run Bhuck and Blair's car into the wall.
Well, what did the police say?
The front of the car was so damaged,
they couldn't inspect it.
The driver passed a breathalyzer,
but I'd like to talk to him myself,
so... why don't we invite him to the party?
I am so excited for New Year's karaoke.
Will you hate me if I sing "Miss world" again?
Andrew Tyler called.
I'm sorry. I... I should have told you I hired him.
I just wanted to make sure Charlie was okay.
What did he say?
Nothing.
Feel good about the fact that your private detective
is discreet enough to not mention his assignment,
even to your husband.
Well, it's just as well that you know.
I hate when we have secrets,
and this was never meant to be one.
Would you mind terribly if I called him
to ask him if he found her?
You obviously won't give this up.
Andrew? It's Lily.
Um, any news of Charlie?
Really?
Okay. Thank you, Andrew.
She never left New York.
She's still here.
Of course I'll think about it.
Let me guess. Louis wants you to go with him
to the "Spectator" Party tonight?
With everything that's happened,
Louis feels it's important for us to have a fresh start.
But I can't.
Well, you're about to be a princess.
Going to social events is kind of your job description.
At international galas
with strangers speaking foreign languages.
I'm not sure I'm ready
to deceive the people who know me best.
Oh, come on.
You're the most accomplished liar I know,
except maybe Jenny, but you trained her.
This is different.
Well, maybe, but, Blair,
what is a lifetime of blackmailing authority figures
and casting out townies
if it doesn't add up to the ability
to at least feign a marginal level of happiness
at an office party?
You know, you banished Georgina to Belarus.
I'm sure you can down a few canapes
and watch the ball drop on Nate's big screen.
Fine. Perhaps I am just clever enough
to pull off such a dissimulation.
Just make sure you continue to never utter a word of the truth.
Blair says she'll come to the party.
I've found at least a dozen photos of her and Dan.
They're obviously sneaking around together.
We both know Blair will have another explanation.
How will I determine what's really the truth?
We won't confront her without her weak link.
Luckily, he'll be at the party, too.
Hey, Nate, place looks great, man.
You'd never know how much bad news passes through here.
Oh, nice to see you, too.
Did you make your resolution about not lying to your friends?
I thought I did that this afternoon.
Yeah, well, our lifestyle editor says people are more likely
to stick to things they put down in writing.
So since you already know yours...
Just twist it onto the tree when you're done.
Champagne?
I think I'm going to freshen up.
I wanna look perfect
for our first public appearance of 2012.
I don't know how you can argue with this.
Dan practically ran
the other way when he arrived.
And still Serena has trouble believing her eyes.
I admit these do look bad,
but they are friends. Maybe they're just talking.
People don't rent secret apartments
to discuss feelings,
and frankly, an affair with Humphrey
is the one thing that explains why she's not confiding in you
and why she stopped speaking to me.
Where are you going?
To ask my best friend the truth.
If Serena alerts Blair,
she could make sure Dan never tells us anything either.
You have a point.
Blair has a special way of controlling men,
but you know this.
And I'm sure you have an idea of how to deal with it
in this case.
They'll never be able to lie about it in front of everyone.
Can I... help you with something?
No, thank you.
Nate said I could use his office
to deal with some Monegasque business.
Happy new year.
When Louis told me you were coming to the party,
I didn't know that meant to hide in the bathroom
the whole time.
I'm not hiding. I'm primping.
They're very different.
One is done in a dark corner,
the other with light-reflecting powder.
B, what's going on?
I feel like we've barely talked since you've been back.
Wedding planning has been all-consuming.
You've had your wedding planned since you were 12.
Whatever it is, you can tell me.
I'm sorry, Blair.
But you lost the baby.
Where's Chuck?
B, he lost a lot of blood,
and he never woke up,
so it's not looking good.
Any word on a family member for that blood transfusion?
Please, God.
You have my baby.
You can't take Chuck, too.
If you exist...
let him live.
I'll do anything.
I promise I'll keep my vow to marry Louis
and never be with him again.
Blair Waldorf?
Chuck Bass is asking for you.
Just because we can't be together
doesn't mean I won't love you.
That's why you cut Chuck out of your life?
B, that nurse wasn't an angel.
I know that, but...
one minute he was dead, and then...
I made a promise, and he was alive.
That wasn't a miracle.
That was modern medicine.
Chuck is fine now.
God would understand you changed your mind.
Don't you think I've tried?
I've been going to church every day.
Dan's been going with me,
trying to figure out a way through this.
I went to talk to father Smythe about it this afternoon.
Blair, it's good to see you.
And you, Dan. Why don't we go into my office?
Thank you, father Smythe.
Having the key so I can escape at any hour
is the only thing that's kept me from losing my mind.
Oh, you know, excuse me. I gotta--I gotta take this.
What's wrong, Blair?
I saw Chuck last night.
That must have been difficult.
I still love him.
I-it's not fair.
He's alive,
but... I feel dead inside without him.
If I broke off my engagement
and begged Chuck to take me back,
god would have to understand, wouldn't he?
That's between you and God.
I'll give you a moment.
Blair? Are you okay?
Now do you see?
There's no way out of it.
If anything ever happened to Chuck,
I would feel like it was my fault.
I made a vow to marry Louis,
and that's what I'm gonna do.
You can't base the rest of your life
on one desperate moment.
God doesn't punish people for being in love.
He wouldn't want you to marry someone
you don't wanna be with.
Louis has been wonderful.
I don't not love him.
Well, then you need to come clean.
He and Chuck think you're having an affair with Dan.
What?
They have photos of the two of you at a townhouse,
and they're gonna out them
unless you tell them the truth.
Never. If it means keeping Chuck safe,
then I'll endure the public humiliation
of allegedly shtupping Humphrey.
I'll lose everything before I lose Chuck all over again.
So much for your resolution.
I thought you said you were done going behind people's backs.
My assistant stopped it before it went to the monitors.
I'm sorry, Nate. I couldn't think
of another way to get Dan to tell the truth.
Which is what?
No, not the year's most secret affair.
Look... I wish I could tell you,
but I-I can't.
Maybe we should run the year in review presentation
and have the public weigh in.
Oh, come on.
That is the last thing
that Blair needs right now.
I swear to you we are not having an affair.
Then what the hell are you doing?
He's having a relationship with me.
This all seems very sudden.
W-well, Blair was really trying to help keep our secret.
I'm sorry, we should tell you guys soon.
Yeah, with our history,
we wanted to make sure that it would actually work this time
before we got our friends and family involved.
And neither of us imagined you would think
Dan was with Blair. I mean, that--
that's even crazier than us being back together.
It certainly is.
Well, I'm glad you're not cheating with anyone,
but, dude, you seriously need
some remedial honesty training.
Yeah, I-I'm-- I really am sorry,
and you, too, Louis.
Um, you and Blair have been through enough.
I should go find her.
Try the ladies' room.
Thank you.
Well, Blair told me about the deal she made,
and if I can't talk her out of it,
the least I can do is try to help her live with it.
Well, now that you're my date,
can I get you a drink?
'cause I, uh, I sure as hell need one.
Rufus, what are you doing here?
You went out for champagne over an hour ago,
and singing karaoke by myself got a little bit humiliating,
so I called Andrew Tyler.
He wouldn't tell me where Charlotte was--
client confidentiality--
so I hired him to find you.
He finally broke down and told me that Charlotte Rhodes
is enrolled here at Juilliard.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to know that she's okay.
You're such a good aunt.
It's one of the reasons I love you.
Now does she know you're here?
No, and I'm--I'm so torn.
I don't wanna confront her
and make her feel worse than she already does,
but I want her to know
that whatever's going on in her life,
that we still care.
It sounds like we should ring her bell and see what happens.
Let's talk to the guard.
oh, wait.
Uh, Charlie?
Sorry?
Uh, um, I-I'm sorry.
I thought you were Charlotte Rhodes.
I am, yeah. People call me "Lola."
And you are?
Looking for a different Charlotte Rhodes.
Oh, it never occurred to me that there--
There might have been two of you.
I'm sorry. Have a happy new year.
You, too.
Should we, um, go home and sing this off?
Come on.
Ladies, if you'll excuse us.
I owe you an apology.
I know I promised to trust you,
but I had a small lapse.
Oh, well, none of us is perfect.
We don't even need to speak of it.
I do.
I thought you were having an affair with Dan.
I'm just glad Serena told me the truth
before I did something I'd regret.
Serena told you what truth?
That you'd been protecting her new relationship with Dan,
just like he did for us
when we weren't ready for my family
to know we were dating.
Of course.
Although they had much more to be ashamed of than we did.
We should let the ladies get back to business.
Blair, please.
After the accident, you told me you'd never leave me.
Now you feel further away than ever.
It's true I've been keeping a secret.
I'm converting to catholicism.
I knew how important it was for you
to be married in the church.
That's wonderful.
Let's go celebrate the first year
of the rest of our lives together.
cheers!
Nate?
This is Greg.
He drove Chuck and Blair's car the night of the accident.
Look, I appreciate the invitation to the party,
but I've already told the police everything I know.
Which is what, exactly?
Those photographers got really close to the car,
but the bigger problem was that
my brakes felt like they had no pressure.
I swear I checked them before my shift started.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry I couldn't tell you
about Serena and me,
but we didn't want our families to know,
and you're kind of like her brother.
So are you.
Well, I didn't do it to upset you.
Humphrey, I don't care about you
or our blonde pseudo-sibling.
Your relationship with Serena
may explain the sneaking around,
but it does not make sense of the fact
Blair cut me out of her life.
Chuck, I swear, I don't know.
I think you do.
And when I find out what secret you've been keeping
and why,
you will pay.
Hey, thanks for covering for me.
I know you're not keen on a Dan deja vu.
Well, it's a sacrifice that I can handle.
It's yours that I'm worried about, though.
There you are.
Serena, you better find Dan.
It's bad luck not to kiss your love
at the stroke of midnight.
10... 9... 8...
Well, I guess this is our cue.
Sorry, I couldn't think of
a better way to save Blair.
3... 2...
1! Happy new year!
I'll be waiting for it. Thank you.
So the car service is tracking down
all the available information.
It was Blair who ordered the car.
Now we just need to find out
everyone who knew she'd be in it.
Am I interrupting?
I'll see what else I can track down.
Thanks.
And I just wanted to say that you were right.
About the Dutch being the best new restaurant in town?
I told you. It was the sloppy duck, right?
No, about Gossip Girl.
As much as I love the idea of a world without her,
the photos of Dan and Blair made me realize
it's not the secrets that cause the problems.
It's the assumptions that people make about them.
So... are you saying
what I think you're saying?
Yeah.
I'm gonna go through all the e-mails
and see if there's a positive way
for me to use what's in them.
You know what that means?
You're basically the new Gossip Girl.
New and improved.
Well, I'm sorry that I spoiled our new year's celebration
by stalking innocent students.
You didn't spoil anything.
You did everything you could for Charlie.
You loved her like she was your own.
But she wasn't.
Maybe it's time I trust Carol with her daughter.
Andrew Tyler found the wrong Charlotte Rhodes,
and I'm gonna tell him to stop looking for the right one.
In the morning, but first we celebrate with a duet
of "Endless love."
Happy new year, Lil.
Happy new year.
Blair, thank god.
Do you know what you've been putting me through?
I'm sorry, Chuck. I...
I-I didn't come here because I changed my mind.
Louis is downstairs waiting for me.
What the hell is going on?
I just came t-to...
to tell you what a wonderful person you've become.
And I hope you won't let this change that.
Well, don't leave me.
I'm not doing it to hurt you.
You sat in the car and you said you'd never go.
We were going to spend the rest of our lives together,
and now you can't even look at me.
Now you... don't even care enough to tell me why?
I saw what was important,
and I made the only choice I could.
If it's not an affair with Humphrey,
something else changed you. What was it?
'Cause love does not just disappear.
We can never be together.
Please...
Chuck, just move on and be happy.
I can't.
Until I know why, I won't stop.
I will use all of the power I have to find out the truth.
Some things are more powerful than even you.
I'm sorry.
Don't let this destroy all the good in you.
Just... because we can't be together
doesn't mean I won't love you.
Just because we can't be together
doesn't mean I won't love you.
I hope Chuck's gonna be okay.
Well, I'd be mad, too, if I was left with no explanation.
I promise I'll be more sensitive
in our breakup.
Hey, why don't we, um, discuss our options
while we raid Dorota's candy stash?
We can't end our fake relationship
the night it started, anyway.
All right.
Thank you for stopping by the Empire with me.
I'm glad you asked.
It seems we've finally stopped keeping secrets
just in time for our wedding.
You're not getting cold feet, are you?
No.
I've never been more sure of any decision my entire life.
I know my I.D. is in here somewhere.
Here it is.
Nate, the car service invoice just came through.
What is it?
Blair got in the wrong car that night.
This says the car that crashed was the one ordered for me.
How about we help each other?
