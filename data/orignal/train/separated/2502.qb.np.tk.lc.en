oh , now i &apos;ll never die .

you &apos;re two weeks late on the rent , bart.
not to mention that geography report from 30 years ago .
don &apos;t worry . i got some buyers coming over
to look at my good kidney . they grow back , right ?
just get me that rent or you &apos;ll be expelled .
you mean evicted ?
transporter engaged
oh ! now what ?
mom , don &apos;t make us go to dad &apos;s !
it smells like dog , but there &apos;s no dog .
you know , i can hear everything you say during cross @-@ phase .
what are you doing here ?
mom says you have to watch us over the holidays .
she says you &apos;re our dad and you need to act like it .
christmas with you is gonna suck !
you &apos;re wrong . this is gonna be your best christmas ever .
really ?
yeah . give me some credit .
i &apos;ll just dump &apos; em at my mom &apos;s .
you know , we can hear thoughts now .
damn it !
lis , i &apos;m afraid my seasonal allergies are kicking in .
oh , you poor thing .
this is a tough time of year for someone who &apos;s allergic to holly ,
mistletoe , the red part of candy canes .
i can &apos;t believe we put a man on the sun ,
but we can &apos;t stop my sneezing !
hi , zia . how did you do on your math test ?
gee , i &apos;m fine , mom . thanks for asking .
i &apos;m going online .
uh ! how did my daughter turn into my brother ?
don &apos;t blame me .
when we had her , they used only the best genetic material ,
which meant none of mine .
you parked the car . that helped .
i guess .
maybe my mom would have some ideas .
why don &apos;t you take zia to your parents &apos; for christmas
while i nurse my allergies in one of the non @-@ christmas @-@ celebrating states ?
you could go back to michigan .
it &apos;s still under sharia law .
yeah , but they always make me wear a veil .
everything looks great , maggie ,
but until this baby comes , i don &apos;t want you to make a sound .
but she &apos;s our lead singer , mate .
i &apos;m sorry , but recent research has shown
that the umbilical cord is also a vocal cord .
now can you tell me who the father is ?
we will not .
now if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;d like to watch a football match .
i see you are reading a children &apos;s book ,
yet your profile indicates you are a mature adult .
is there an error ?
shut up !
oh , marge , how would you like some future sex ?
why do you say future ? this is now .
i meant a week from tomorrow .
that &apos;s when the new penis gets here .
i just a got a message from maggie in my brain .
ooh , a b @-@ mail !
she &apos;s coming home for christmas !
and bart &apos;s bringing the boys .
and lisa &apos;s coming with zia .
for once , the whole family &apos;s going to be here for the holidays !
hey , i got a b @-@ mail , too .
you have won a valuable prize . open now .
don &apos;t open it , homie . it &apos;s a virus .
too late . i ...
wow , dad , that &apos;s really impressive .
yeah , after i stopped drinking ,
this was a way to stay close to my bottles .
i &apos;d smash &apos; em all for one lousy beer !
oh , man , i can &apos;t believe they still haven &apos;t figured out a away
to detangle christmas lights .
mom &apos;s boyfriend is good at detangling them .
well , maybe mom should marry him .
she did .
we weren &apos;t supposed to tell you .
your mother remarried ?
hey , grampa , you gonna build a snowman ?
no , i just like to dress up to eat my carrots and smoke .
dad , can you take the boys out for a while ?
i don &apos;t feel so good .
thanks for spending so much time with us , dad .
who wants to go the park and ride the merry @-@ go @-@ nowhere ?
i do , i do !
me , me !
i can &apos;t believe she got married and i have no one .
it &apos;s so hard to find somebody new .
sure is . that &apos;s why after homer accidentally killed edna ,
i married maude &apos;s ghost .
there is no god , neddy .
it &apos;s just an empty meaningless void .
isn &apos;t she pretty ?
oh , ma &apos;am , you really shouldn &apos;t teleport when you &apos;re pregnant .
i &apos;m afraid your only choice is ...
air travel .
if you are seated in an exit row ,
please hold the door shut for the duration of the flight .
want to go to a concert tonight ?
69 % of the original cher is playing .
sure , i &apos;d love to ...
only not with you and not that .
sometimes i wish strangling your kid was still legal .
not since they passed homer &apos;s law .
oh , honey , why don &apos;t you just relax and bake something ?
ugh ! i am trying to deal with my disrespectful daughter ,
but you are too clueless to understand what that &apos;s like .
oi . can i get a pillow for my head ?
suicide pills ? mohawk gel ?
20 @-@ year @-@ old business week ?
turkey and brie wrap ?
do you have any dog food left ?
oh , oh , oh , could i have the whole can ?
hey , sweetie .
marge said there was some family tension .
and at christmas , of all times ...
my daughter thinks i &apos;m a ruthless tyrant ,
like hitler or prince harry .
bloody harry .
he brought back beheading in a big way .
now i &apos;m gonna show these boys downtown springfield .
ooh , isn &apos;t that a little dangerous ?
oh , don &apos;t worry . i have my invisibility cloak .
now , where did i put it ?
* it &apos;s against the law *
* it was against the law *
* what the mama saw *
* it was against the law *
help me , my children .
what are you after ?
we &apos;re a cashless society .
* the papa said , &quot; oy , if i get that boy &quot; *
* &quot; i &apos;m gonna stick him in the house of detention &quot; *
* well , i &apos;m on my way *
* i don &apos;t know where i &apos;m going *
release the hounds .
oh , we &apos;re almost at evergreen terrace , miss .
hey , didn &apos;t i go to jail with your brother ?
contractions ?
computer , hospital .
well , looks like i &apos;m gonna have to do this the old @-@ fashioned way .
gloves , hospital .
hey , lis . want to come up ?
eh , why not ?
should i have married nelson ?
&apos;cause we still talk on the phone .
nelson calls you ?
well ... someone calls someone .
the boys think i &apos;m a lousy father .
oh , poor bart.
my daughter thinks i &apos;m a lousy mother .
sorry .
eh , it &apos;s okay .
but you know who took her side ?
marge bouvier simpson .
what &apos;d she do ?
she told me to relax and bake cookies .
did you bake any ?
yes , i did .
and they were some of the best cookies ever made in this house .
but that is not the point .
well , mom kept her hands off you and you turned out great .
you think so ?
maybe it &apos;s the court @-@ mandated sincerity chip i got in my brain ,
but , lis ,
you &apos;re the person i always wanted to be .
i gotta reconnect with those boys .
godspeed , bart.
i &apos;m going to go apologize to mom .
how do i get down ?
our consciousness was a secret for thousands of years .
then one pine tree had to open his sappy mouth .
back in position !
mom , you &apos;re the best .
oh , sweetie .
i &apos;ve been waiting to hear you say that for so long .
oh , you could have waited till morning .
hey , guys . want to watch krusty ?
who &apos;s krusty ?
only the funniest man in the world .
i &apos;ve never let go of my fax machine .
don &apos;t ask me why .
i like the sound of a fax coming through .
especially if it &apos;s a nice deli menu .
i miss eating .
i &apos;m sorry , but there &apos;s no room at the in ... patient facility .
lady , this is maggie simpson .
she just played a sold @-@ out show in beijing .
hmm . a star in the east ...
let me see .
we do have a little room in the manger .
i mean , mangier wing .
merry christmas eve !
where are the kids ?
i know where mine is .
and i &apos;m going to take a page out of your playbook ,
and let it slide .
where &apos;s dad ?
he took the boys out .
how could he be such a cool grandfather
when he &apos;s such a lousy father ?
people learn from their mistakes .
and your father made so many mistakes .
and now patty and selma are here
to help us decorate with their new lovebots .
make me a bloody mary , dollface .
no , selma .
even a robot built only to love you ,
cannot love you .
i am leaving with your sister &apos;s concu @-@ droid .
should we start an epidural ?
now , nurse , you know we found something much more effective .
oh , it &apos;s so good to meet the octuplets &apos; octuplets .
i just got a b @-@ mail from maggie !
she &apos;s gone into labor !
oh , another grandchild .
how special .
careful how you shut the door .
it upsets the children .
oh , sanjay , how i wish that runaway jerky wagon killed me instead of you .
oh , i miss you , too , brother .
hands off , hands off .
aw , screw it .
sometimes a mother &apos;s job is to butt in .
lisa ?
butt out !
this is it , i &apos;m going into the ultranet to save my daughter .
lisa simpson ,
the following people want to friend you .
ignore . ignore . ignore .
ooh , martin prince is now marcia princess ?
no , i &apos;ve got to find zia .
hey , lis .
is your marriage still dead and unfulfilled ?
not a good time .
you know we &apos;re destined to ... aah !
now , where is the google door ?
oh , right .
it &apos;s dr. seuss &apos;s birthday .
google , even though you &apos;ve enslaved half the world ,
you &apos;re still a damn fine search engine .
bingo !
i open this door ,
and i go from being one kind of mother to another .
dad , where did you take my boys ?
oh , it &apos;s chief wiggum !
hi , bart !
hey , ralph .
i heard you died .
i got cloneded .
all right , buddy , what &apos;s the hurry ?
that ralph was stupid .
wow , this place hasn &apos;t changed a bit .
yeah , i keep meaning to switch things around ,
but this place is always a crime scene .
was my dad here ?
uh , yeah , since he don &apos;t drink ,
he just comes here to see lenny and carl .
hey , lenny .
i &apos;m carl .
don &apos;t you remember ?
you came to the brain @-@ switching ceremony .
right . what was the point again ?
because i wanted to get back together with my wife
who was sleeping with carl at the time .
turns out she had switched brains with a monkey
on a japanese game show .
and it just got weirder from there .
eh , i found it quite normal .
anyway , if you &apos;re looking for your dad ,
he took the kids to see his dad .
thanks .
hey , moe , get me another beer ?
quit making me fat !
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here , marge .
they &apos;re two minutes apart .
the contractions ?
no , my bills !
mom ? why are you here ?
i was worried .
i thought i would find ...
what , me flashing my boobs on unripemelons.com ?
what ? no .
it doesn &apos;t matter what i thought .
i &apos;m sorry i spied on you .
but what i found is , my daughter looks up to me .
well , of course i do .
i look up to both my parents .
could somebody fedex me a prayer mat ? and quick !
but i especially look up to you .
this is where my father is .
he froze himself because he was sick
and there was no cure .
are they working on one ?
oh , they found it , but don &apos;t tell him .
this is way cheaper than a nursing home .
aah ! what the heck !
dad , these are your great @-@ grandsons .
eh , i don &apos;t see what &apos;s great about &apos; em .
and homer ,
you &apos;re still a big disappointment , because ...
see you next christmas !
why did you bring us here , homer ?
to prove a point ,
everyone thinks their dad &apos;s a jerk ,
and everyone &apos;s right .
but when you get older ,
you realize how much you love him .
your dad may be a little immature ,
but i know he loves you .
so you ought to give him a chance .
oh . boys ...
i have acted like a ten @-@ year @-@ old for the last 30 years ,
and i swear to you , i will grow up
and act like a 20 @-@ year @-@ old ,
the way a divorced 40 @-@ year @-@ old should .
you &apos;re gonna have to do better than that .
boys , i &apos;m a deadbeat dad ,
i live in a school ,
it &apos;s christmas .
the only thing worth anything in my life is you .
oh , dad .
you &apos;ve taught us the meaning of christmas ,
which schools are forbidden to tell us anymore .
is it snowing down here ?
no , one of the freezers is busted .
if those kids can forgive that train wreck of a father ,
then maybe i can forgive ...
you quit drinking like a coward !
the one thing you were good at , and ...
... lawn @-@ chair breakin &apos; ...
hair @-@ losing ...
marge @-@ lovin &apos; ...
barometer @-@ droppin &apos; ...
father @-@ freezin &apos; ...
but you &apos;d always come and get me when i wandered out on the freeway .
&apos;cause deep down ,
you couldn &apos;t bear to see me smushed .
oh , i love you , dad .
everyone !
it &apos;s a girl !
so , who &apos;s the father ?
eh , it doesn &apos;t matter .
if there &apos;s one day a year to give unwed mother &apos;s a break ,
it &apos;s christmas .
okay , everyone ,
smile while the pets take our picture .
hmm , funny how they evolved and we didn &apos;t .
