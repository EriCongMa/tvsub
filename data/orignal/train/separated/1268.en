I know I've failed you.
But please, lord,
Please help me.
I was afraid you wouldn't come back.
I got scared.
But you know what?
Maybe we'll get through this.
Come on. What are you doing?
I got it.
Maura, w-we should use plastic.
For a christening?
It's sparkling cider. And T.J. doesn't care.
I care. It's my first grandchild.
Tommy, you're helping us clean these.
Why?
'cause he's your kid.
Rondo?
Vanilla. Look at those legs!
Bro!
Hey!
"Bro"?
Man, I was on my way to a barbecue.
Brought you something for your special day.
Hey, little man, you being good?
You got him a rolex?
No. Got a guy, got me a good deal.
Looks real, don't it?
Have I just been transported to some parallel univer--
When did you two start a bromance?
Oh, we go way back.
Yeah, we met at the cafe last week.
Tom-tom, have fun, my man.
All right. Thanks.
Hey, make sure his baby mama don't mess with him.
He's a good daddy.
What, is there something going on between Lydia and Tommy?
Hey, as long as they share custody
over a baby they made on their first date, I don't ask.
Oh, Frankie!
Why did you leave this mess?
Jane, it's okay.
No, it's not.
I thought you were gonna restore it for your new undercover job.
Oh, there's no point.
I'm not exclusive to the drug unit anymore.
They made me a "Floating" Detective.
Oh, cool.
Yeah. I get to try out everything. Look at this.
What --
"Bpd cuts to affect all detectives."
It won't happen.
Might.
I have to "Float"
until some department comes up with the funds.
Um, everybody, we should go.
I got the baby. I got the baby!
well, this should be awkward.
Because of Lydia?
No. That's the priest that tommy ran over in the crosswalk.
Well, why didn't he choose another church?
Because ma said that we owed it to father Crowley
to let him baptize the...Next generation of rizzolis.
You don't think he's still mad, do you?
Oh, why would he be mad? You just broke both his legs.
Hey, I spent three years in prison.
That's plenty of penance.
You didn't talk to him, did you?
Uh, I meant to...
God, Tommy. You see why he got all the attention?
He needed it?
Father crowley,
Thank you so much for doing this.
The parish appreciates your kind donation, Angela.
Hello, Thomas.
You do plan to raise this child in the catholic faith?
Uh...Sure. Why not?
It's the role of the mother and father
to present the child to the church.
And who are the parents?
We are.
We are.
Oh, uh, and me.
Stuart!
Everyone, this is Stuart.
M-my friends call me "Strawberry."
We are not your "Friends."
Tommy.
Mr. Strawberry, we are in the middle of a service.
What is this guy doing at my son's christening?
I invited him.
He has every right to be here.
What are you doing?
Something smells.
Yeah, it's probably T.J.'s diaper. Stop.
No, I-I'm smelling something else.
Yeah, somethin' does stink.
Tommy, we're in a church.
Tell her. She's the one who brought her lover.
He's my fiance.
Huh? What?
Your what?
Wh-- you cannot go up there.
Okay. Father, if you would just baptize this -- this little guy,
We'll -- we'll get out of your hair.
No. Not with this guy here.
Place the infant over the baptismal font.
What name do you wish to give your child?
There are human remains in there.
Strawbridge.
Strawbridge? Over my dead body.
You sure?
Well, I can't be sure unless I take a look, but...
In the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit,
I -- - what a lovely service.
Thank you so much. We have to go.
Come on. - Okay, Jane, we didn't even --
Ma, that's a wrap.
Frankie, can you help me get everybody out of here, please?
Uh, there's a potential biological hazard
in the baptismal font.
Gotcha.
Okay, everybody, come on. Let's go.
I knew T.J. should've been a methodist.
I should've picked a better mom for him.
You didn't "Pick" Me.
We got drunk and did it in my car,
and then you on passed me on to your father. Remember?
Is that why I no longer see frank sr. at mass?
Is there any way that we could
just tell our little family stories outside, please?
I'm so sorry, father.
We're usually not like this.
Okay, take it slow. It's heavy.
Let's get it over here.
in the baptismal font? Is nothing sacred?
It appears to be a young female.
She looks like old shoe leather.
Okay, Frost, go talk to father Crowley.
Ask him when the last time
the water in the basin was changed.
Yeah, okay.
Any idea what that white powder is?
It has the odor and texture of agricultural lime.
Ag-lime. I use that in my garden.
You garden? I didn't know that, sergeant.
What do you grow?
Well, let's see, I got tomatoes, basil, kitchen herbs.
I think I'll have a really good crop of green beans this year.
Oh, you know, I had great luck with french beans.
Okay, farmers.
Let's work on the almanac later. All right?
Why would someone put ag-lime on her?
It accelerates desiccation and masks the odor.
Huh. How was she killed?
There are ligature marks.
So she was strangled.
Well, I didn't say that.
I did.
Well, how long has she been dead?
Well, the ag-lime is gonna make it difficult
to determine post-mortem interval.
It was poured on her within an hour of her death.
Okay. That helps.
Says to me that she was killed in the church.
It doesn't say that to me.
Well, a murderer isn't going to strangle her
and then drag her all the way in here, dump her in there,
then run all the way back out and get the ag-lime.
Bet we'll find ag-lime on the grounds.
What did Father Crowley say?
He said... "Tommy rizzoli has always been trouble."
Did he say when the church was locked?
Between midnight and 4:00 a.M.
Who has keys?
Staff, janitors, gardeners, choir,
and anybody who uses the meeting rooms.
And 500 other parishioners.
There's an awful lot of suspects.
If we have this ag-lime anywhere,
It would be in our shed.
Thank you.
Mateo.
Good morning, father.
Hope you like petunias.
We're replanting the flower beds.
Yes, of course.
Hello, Samuel.
Hello, father.
Back from Britmore so soon?
Actually, we're just back on break.
Britmore. That's a really good college.
He's a hard worker.
Getting straight a's.
Dad.
Father, is everything okay up at the church?
I saw police.
Do you use ag-lime on the church grounds?
Yes.
Where do you keep it? I'd like to see it.
Sure.
Sal, open the shed, would you?
Show them the ag-lime?
Yeah, okay.
Right there.
You keep the shed locked?
No. It's a church.
Who's going to steal from it?
Same person who's gonna murder in one.
I'll get a sample and have the crime lab
run it against the powder on the body.
Thomas Edward Rizzoli, what do you think you're doing?
Eating cake.
Come in.
Yeah, why not?
It's not a party without T.J.
Did somebody say "Party"?
You people need party lessons.
I'm screwed. She's got a new guy.
That little ho.
Pardon me?
Sorry, Mrs. Vanilla.
By the way, how long has Mr. Strawberry fellow
been in the picture?
I don't know.
You're the father. It's your job to know.
What's it matter?
Stuart's gonna take him from me.
He can't, Tommy.
Unmarried fathers are entitled to the same rights.
Yeah, you have a custody order.
There. You see?
Well, what if...You, like, got the papers filled out
and you're about to file them...
You didn't file the custody papers.
Thomas!
Oh!
I meant to.
Like you "meant to"
put the parking brake on the Cutlass?
What happened with the Cutlass?
It rolled through Mrs. Sutter's garage
and blew apart her pool.
That above-ground pool sucked, anyway.
Wait. If you have no rights to t.J.,
Neither do I.
I gotta go to work.
That smell in the church was a dead body.
On our first family baptism?
Wait. Wait. Can you and Jane fix this Stuart thing?
Not everything's "Fixable."
Unbelievable.
I I don't know what to do. Do you?
Beat him senseless.
Okay, Maura, talk to me
and detective floater here about our victim.
Well, she hasn't had dental work.
Okay. So we can't I.D. Her with dental records.
No. And her iliac crest is fused,
but it's recent.
She's between the ages of 17 and 22.
Did you do a vaginal exam?
Yes. She wasn't raped.
Where's the magnifying thingy?
Yeah.
Thank you.
What do you make of those marks?
Marks from the ligature.
Quite distinctive -- symmetrical and evenly spaced.
It's not from the locket she was wearing.
Chain's too thin.
You think that little girl's our victim?
Hmm. It's possible.
Similar bone structure.
Okay, uh, we'll go out on a limb here.
The woman with her --
so dangerous to make wild leaps --
is it her babysitter?
You're not going to make me say that it's her mother.
I think she just did.
Uh, there's something dried on her pants.
Mm. I'll have Susie test it.
There's a receipt in her pocket.
For what?
I don't know. It's faded.
Thermal paper doesn't use ink. Fades immediately.
I'll have the crime lab look at it.
Her shirt and her pants are both off-93 apparel.
That's a pretty common brand. I-I can track it, though.
Yeah, do that.
Oh, a tattoo.
Oh, the tissue is inflamed.
It was done within eight hours of her death.
It's homemade. Whoever did it used a ballpoint pen.
Maybe she just got out of prison
or it's a gang tattoo.
Want me to track it through the gang tattoo database?
Considering it's the only tattoo database we've have,
Yes, please.
I live to float.
I'll scan her prints,
but I'm not optimistic unless she was arrested.
Even if she was a gang-banger, she has a mother.
I think this is our victim. How old does she look to you?
Seven, maybe?
Did you run her prints?
No hits.
I'll get an x-ray of her skull from dr. Isles
and use this photo and do a computer age progression.
I ran a check on the sexual offenders
that live near the church -- there's a half a dozen of them.
I don't think we're looking for a sexual offender.
She wasn't raped.
Is this everybody with keys to the church?
Or access to them, yeah.
Any of these guys have a record?
I'll call the vatican
and see what father Crowley's been up to.
He's a good suspect.
He hates everybody, especially Tommy.
How was the christening?
Oh, think of your worst family holiday,
and multiply by ten.
Oh, I'm sorry, Jane.
Well, Sal Perez did five years for a string of b&e's.
Maybe our victim caught him stealing something from the church?
Yeah, check and see if anything's missing.
Oh, Frankie came by. No hits on that tattoo.
He seems to be taking the new assignment pretty well.
You think this budget-cut story is accurate?
I heard it could happen.
Yeah, but they're not gonna make cuts in homicide, are they?
I don't count on anything.
Mayor White laid off 250 cops in the '80s.
I was out for a year.
You were a shorty Pasquale pizza boy?
I had to pay the rent.
I keep this to remind myself to be grateful.
All right, Maura's got something.
Evidence of two spiral fractures --
right radius and left ulna.
So, two people held her down and broke both her arms.
That's one possible scenario.
The fractures are small.
It happened within 24 hours of her death.
That's not enough, Maura.
I need to know when she died.
Ag-lime made that impossible.
Jane, if I can't narrow down the time of death,
you certainly can't.
Strawbridge, Strawberry...
Are you doing what I think you're doing?
How did you know I'm looking at porn?
No, wait,
I logged in as you, so Dr. Isles is looking at porn.
Oh. What?! Move over.
Oh, I guess it's all right to be looking up Stuart.
He's a home wrecker. Look.
"A rocking farewell to Strawberry.
Don't forget all the little people
as you head to the big time
at big box's headquarters in Abilene"?
"My new family."
He's taking T.J. to Abilene.
It'll be okay, ma.
Yeah, Strawberry's a stable guy.
He seems nice. He's got a job.
T.J. could do worse.
Tommy couldn't even fill out his papers, Jane.
Yeah, but he loves T.J., frankie. And so do we.
There's only one thing we can do.
Please don't suggest kidnapping to two cops.
We need to get Tommy and Lydia back together.
Okay, but they never were "Together."
Tommy had a one-night stand and then introduced Lydia --
I don't care.
I will do whatever I have to do to get my grandbaby back,
especially since neither one of you are making any.
Ma!
Ma.
I know Tommy likes Lydia.
What, did he tell you that?
Didn't have to. She likes him, too.
That's why they act like
7th-graders when they're around each other.
Are you sure that's not a brain problem?
Jane.
What?
Well, what if we got the two of them together --
I mean, in the same place.
Well, so, what, we're in "The parent trap" now?
Oh, that's a great idea.
What -- what are you doing?
Frankie.
Hey, Lydia. It's Frankie. Jane asked me to call you.
No. Uh-huh.
Well, she feels really bad
that she wasn't able to give T.J. his present.
Present? No, I didn't get him one yet!
No, she's gonna be stuck at work all day today, so...
it would really mean a lot if you could come by.
Great!
Yeah, bye.
What the hell? Where am I gonna get a present?
Just get Lydia to your apartment,
and I'll get Tommy there.
That's a genius idea!
That's a terrible idea.
What, you got a better one?
No!
That doesn't look good.
What?
I can't take any more bad news today.
It's a letter from the brass.
They're saying there might be layoffs.
What?
We might be "Reallocated"? What does that mean?
Might put us back in uniform, add 9-1-1 calls to the job.
Can they do that?
Yeah.
At least yours won't suggest you take early retirement.
What about me? Last man in, first man out.
Detective Frost,
you did a really nice job on the age progression,
I would just extend the nose a little bit
and take another pass on her ears.
All right.
What's wrong? Jane.
Oh, nothing.
We can't identify a dead girl,
my nephew is moving to Texas with a Strawberry,
and I might have to wear my uniform to work.
Oh. Well, then, this won't help.
The crime lab wasn't able to restore anything on the receipt.
Can I see it? What did you try?
Uh, a dry iron and U.V. Light.
I might be able to show them an old-school trick.
It's worth a try.
Come on, Maura. My visitor's here.
Come on where?
To your office. It's an emergency.
What kind of emergency?
The kind where you don't ask me any questions and trust me.
I don't like that type of emergency.
I-I wanted to get T.J. something special.
It's a developmental mask.
You can play a really stimulating game of peekaboo.
And research shows that it boosts I.Q. by ten points.
Ten whole points?
Mm-hmm.
We're gonna need a lot more masks.
You're such a good aunt.
Oh, well, you know, we all love T.J.
The proposal was real sudden.
But Abilene has good schools,
and T.J. will be able to have lots of dogs, and...
Strawberry will be a good dad.
Mm, a good dad, like Tommy?
He'll change his diaper and sing him to sleep
and clean the spit-up -- it was so sweet.
Tommy is so good with that baby.
But T.J. Is his son, so...
Yeah.
But we'll have a house,
and T.J. will have brothers and sisters.
Stuart wants his own kids.
"His own kids"?
Poor T.J.
I've got to go.
Oh, well, we wanted to throw you
a goodbye dinner before you left.
Oh, yeah. That sounds nice. Call me.
Yeah -- we-- uh, no. Uh, t-tonight.
What a good idea.
Oh, I can't...
Really? Oh, that's too bad...
'cause with all the budget cuts,
tonight's my last night here.
It is?
Yes. They are transferring me...
to guam.
Whoa, all the way out by Braintree?
Farther.
Yeah, let's have a girls' night.
Yeah? Okay. Yes!
Yay!
Uh, so, um, tonight? 7:00?
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Guam?
Sergeant Korsak is in the crime lab, working on the receipt.
Okay. I want to get our victim's profile out to the media.
Will you please help me with lydia?
Of course.
But, Jane, that ring that he gave her --
It's a cubic zirconia.
The nerve!
Vidal Sassoon always came through for me.
Moment of truth.
You did it. There's a name.
Cortez Bodega.
There's a date, too. Friday the 28th -- two days ago.
Cortez Bodega is located on Cortez Street,
That's across the street from the off-93 apparel factory,
which is the same brand of clothing
that the victim was wearing.
Maybe our victim worked at that factory.
That's why she was shopping at a bodega across the street.
I'll get Frost and Frankie. We'll check it out.
We'd like to show you a computer-generated photo
of what we think she looked like.
And you think she worked here?
We do.
It looks like Isabella.
That's her.
She's the daughter of one of our seamstresses.
She started working in packaging two months ago.
Do you recognize this woman?
Bianca valdez,
Isabella's mother.
Is she working today?
Yes.
I'll go get her.
I talked to the bodega owner. He remembers the victim.
I got the security-camera video from Friday.
Did he remember what she bought?
A religious candle...
and a pregnancy kit.
Oh, boy.
Is it Isabella?
She's dead, isn't she?
Yes.
Did your daughter go to st. Evillius?
Yes.
Every Sunday.
She made her first communion there.
Is there any reason she would've been there Friday night?
I don't think so.
She was beautiful.
Inside, too.
So smart, so sweet.
She was accepted into every college she applied to.
Why didn't she go?
Look, we don't care about your status, okay?
We care about your daughter.
She didn't get to go to college
because she couldn't take the scholarships
Once they knew...
That she was undocumented.
Help us find her killer.
We need a list of her friends.
They all went off to college...
and left her behind to work in a factory,
Like her mother.
Did Isabella have a boyfriend?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
Um, this is our chief medical examiner, Dr. Maura Isles.
I am terribly sorry to tell you
that your daughter was four weeks' pregnant.
Oh, dios...
Dios...
I'm so sorry.
Can you tell us what this tattoo means?
Four corners.
The four corners gang?
We both worked four corners drug cases.
Never saw one like that.
We found the same mark on your daughter.
It's only for the chosen few --
Special girls the gang leaders want for themselves.
Did you know that your daughter was in a gang?
She wasn't in a gang.
Four corners took her, and they killed her.
Why do you say that?
Once that mark is on you, you're their property.
They kill you if you leave before they're done with you.
Ay, dios,
My poor girl.
We're gonna do everything we can to find your daughter's killer.
I know you will.
You brought her home to me.
I asked Maura to look up that tattoo in old autopsy photos,
See if maybe there were any victims before she was the M.E.
That's a good idea.
Isabella's mother said
the four corners would kill a girl who tried to leave.
Isabella didn't have time to leave.
She was killed the same day they inked her.
Something else happened.
Jane, I think I found what you're looking for
in the archives.
Frost, can you look up a cold case --
Araceli ramirez?
There might be more. I just went back through 2004.
Araceli ramirez was killed near four corners in 2004.
All three suspects were gang members.
Where are those suspects today?
Two are in prison. One dead.
Isabella clocks in for work at 7:00 A.M.
Goes to the bodega during lunch, works until 4:00.
Did Frankie say if there was a bathroom in the bodega?
Yeah, in the back.
So, Isabella takes a full hour for lunch.
Maybe she takes the pregnancy test in the store bathroom.
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
And what does an 18-year-old practicing catholic girl
with no money do when she finds out she's pregnant?
She definitely doesn't have an abortion.
She talks to a friend.
Yeah. And Isabella didn't have a cellphone,
so maybe it was a work friend.
Maybe someone with ties to four corners.
Let's pull employee records and run them.
Frost, look for any off-93 employee who has gang affiliations.
Oh, my god. It's 6:30, Jane.
So?
So, at 7:00, people are showing up at your apartment.
Oh, my god. I totally forgot.
Go. We got this.
Thanks, guys!
It's so nice of you to make a homemade dinner.
Yeah.
It's not a problem. I love to cook.
Isn't she such a good dog?
Oh, yes, she is.
Yes, you are a good doggie. Oh, yes, you are.
So, how fun that you are moving to Abilene.
You can go to the rodeo,
And -- and celebrate the pioneer spirit,
And, you know, what else are you gonna do?
I just can't wait to fill a house
with doggies and kittens and babies.
Right, Jo Friday?
Who's a good doggie?
Who's a good doggie?
Only you and Tommy can get her to do that.
She doesn't do that for anybody else.
Yeah. Tommy and T.J. would, you know, play with her
and take her for walks.
It will be so sad that Tommy can't do that anymore.
Yeah...That is sad.
You should hear T.J. laugh when he plays with Tommy.
Sad he isn't gonna have his daddy.
Lydia, can you get that for me?
I-I have a neighbor returning something.
Lydia.
What are you doing here?
Moving the couch.
Uh, where'd you want it, Vanilla?
Where it is.
Frankie said he'd give us 200 bucks to move it.
Did he?
Tommy, you should stay for dinner.
Yes, you should.
And we'll help you move the couch later.
So sorry for your trouble.
Oh, no -- no trouble. No trouble.
Mmm. That's home cooking. Mmm. That smells good.
Why you gotta be like that?
Get out.
Get out. - That's no -- okay. All right.
Okay.
Here.
Sit down.
Dinner will be ready soon.
Get the dog.
Why?
Just do it!
It will just be a couple more minutes.
Oh, Jo Friday!
Bad dog!
Oh, your pot roast. Jane.
She sure loves pot roast.
That's so cute.
So, Maura, we should probably get some take-out, right?
Yes. Yeah.
Okay. We'll be fast.
But you two should stay here and keep an eye on Jo Friday.
How come?
Well, she could choke on that pot roast.
She has a small gullet.
Bye.
Bye.
What are you doing?!
What am I doing? What are you doing?
Move.
Jo Friday really likes you.
Okay. Okay, she just said that Jo Friday really likes Tommy.
Well, that's good.
Verbal compliments often serve as foreplay,
which then lead to the release of dopamine and oxytocin.
Oh, dope and Oxycontin?
They gonna have a good night.
So, that's the ring he gave you, huh?
He just asked about her ring.
Do you think he'll notice it's a cubic zirconia?
I think he'll notice it's the size of a grain of sand.
Must have cost him a whole $10.
Yeah, he noticed.
At least he has a job!
Ohh, the big box copy boy!
Well, it's better than taking money
for moving his sister's couch because she feels sorry for you!
Ouch.
Wow, you got that food fast.
Look, I'm sorry. I just --
We'll have to do this all in Guam. I have to go.
That went well.
Frankie helped me cross-reference
the gang database and Off-93 employee records.
So, did you find Isabella's work friend?
Think so.
Josie Garcia.
A member of Four Corners.
She's was arrested six times for assault and battery,
four times for drugs.
Nice friend.
She worked with Isabella in packing.
I'm getting Josie's phone records,
see if she texted her gang buddies
to help her beat up Isabella.
The substance that Frankie noticed on Isabella's pant leg
is red candle wax.
She bought a candle at the bodega.
We need to come up with a way to get rid of Strawberry.
Sounds like a conspiracy I don't want to be part of.
I'm gonna grab some coffee. Want any?
No, thanks.
"Get rid of"?
Sounds like the words of a mob boss's daughter.
Which I am.
Think about it -- Everybody has a dark side.
We simply exploit Stuart's.
Really? What's his "dark side"?
Did he make copies of his butt at the big box store?
I don't think that's enough.
No, I know he hasn't been arrested.
Oh, did a background check.
You abused your authority.
Why don't you keep your voice down, all right?
Yes, I wanted to know if a grown man that goes by "Strawberry"
was ever arrested for child abuse or urinating in public.
The only dark thing I noticed about him
were his periorbital circles.
Dark circles under his eyes.
Stuart has severe allergies.
Okay. Well, thank you.
That's very helpful, Maura.
But I don't think Lydia's gonna turn down a house
and medical insurance and her doggies because Stuart... has allergies.
Oh, my god.
Allergies!
Severe allergies.
That's it! It's --
Warrant came through. I've got Josie's texts...
Okay, now we're talking.
To Tito -- "The 1 u like is pregnant."
It's time-stamped right at her lunch.
And there's a response from this "Tito" Person.
"Beat her down and ink her."
What does that mean?
You can read Latin but you can't understand that?
Gang unit lists Tito Varela as the leader of Four Corners.
He's out on parole.
So, Tito wanted Isabella.
And Josie made it her job to deliver.
Sounds right.
Josie texted her two friends
after she heard from Tito.
"Ball up ink party 4 on Cortez."
Latin is simpler.
No, they planned to ambush Isabella on Cortez Street...
...until she curled up into a "ball."
"4" means 4:00 -- right after work.
Maybe Tito finished her off in the church.
Yeah, check and see if Tito's parole
requires electronic monitoring.
Yeah, he's on an ankle bracelet...
But he didn't leave his house from Friday to Sunday.
So that means Tito's not our killer.
Let's go see Josie.
Is it okay if I take Frankie? He was really helpful.
Yeah. He could use the practice.
Take a good look, Josie.
She thought you were her friend.
She was dumb, then.
Dumb to tell you she was pregnant.
We didn't do that to her.
We inked her. That's all.
You did a little more than that.
You broke both of her arms.
Not on purpose.
Tito told you to ink her.
Why? He want a relationship with her?
"Relationship"? Nah.
He saw her, he wanted to bang her.
So he wasn't the father of her baby?
No. That's why I had to tell Tito.
She thought she could break away,
didn't have to be part of four corners.
Do you know who the father was?
Some college boy.
What's his name?
I don't know.
Think hard, Josie.
You're still looking at murder.
What?!
Some guy she met at church.
That's all I know.
Jane's told me bits and pieces about Tommy's predicament.
Yeah.
I can't imagine losing this little baby.
That's the mother of the girl we found in the church.
Ms. Valdez?
Good morning.
Sergeant, I found something
in the back of my daughter's closet.
Is that your baby?
Oh, gosh, no.
It's -- it's my grandbaby.
I'll never have a grandchild.
Could I get you something? A cup of coffee?
No, no. Thank you.
Um, Sergeant, please, look inside.
I don't know what it means.
Britmore College.
Do you know who it belongs to?
I might.
The church gardener's kid, Samuel Morales,
goes to Britmore.
Running him.
No arrest record.
I'll get his phone records and his credit cards.
I'll grab Jane. We'll bring him in.
Samuel, we have the records right here.
You took the 6:00 p.m. train
from New Haven to Boston on Friday.
You came to Boston after Isabella called you
on the prepaid phone you bought for her, didn't you?
Did Isabella join a gang? She start seeing somebody else?
She make you jealous, Sam?
Isabella wasn't in a gang.
She should've gone to Britmore with me.
she was brilliant.
They inked her
because she didn't want be part of four corners.
When did you see Isabella's tattoo?
In the church.
I met her there.
Why did you kill her, Samuel?
My father told me that we couldn't be seen together...
...or the four corner gang-bangers
were gonna kill us both.
I left her in that church.
Why did I do that?
You left her after you strangled her?
He said he would take care of it.
I want to talk to father Crowley.
Get out of here!
I want to talk to father Crowley!
Okay.
I think he might want to confess.
Even if he does, it won't be admissable
because I can't testify.
Understood, father. But
maybe he'll talk to us once he talks to you.
He's in here.
Frost! Help us! We've got to get him down!
Father, he's still alive! Call an ambulance!
Hey! Someone! Ambulance!
Watch his head.
Come on, Samuel.
Come on, buddy.
He's in critical condition, but he's alive.. Thanks.
What about brain damage?
They don't think so,
but there's a lot of damage to his larynx.
Damn.
As soon as he gets out of the hospital,
he'll be going on trial for killing his girlfriend.
Why did Samuel say his father wouldn't let
him and Isabella be seen with gang-bangers?
Frost, can you look up Mateo morales?
Yeah.
His father seemed to know the gang would kill her
once a banger like Tito had claimed her.
Yeah. "He said he'd take care of it."
What did that mean?
Mateo Morales, Sam's father,
was once a four corners gang member.
Look at the rosary.
Explains the ligature marks.
St. Margaret of Cortona,
Patron saint of single mothers.
Isabella would have given up Samuel
and taken care of their baby by herself
if she thought that'd give Samuel a better life.
But you knew Samuel would never give up Isabella, didn't you?
You told your son you'd take care of it.
He thought you meant
that you'd help take care of him and his pregnant girlfriend.
Instead, you wrapped that rosary around Isabella's neck
and strangled that 18-year-old girl.
I bet we find Isabella's dna on that rosary.
She belonged to them.
She wasn't a gang member.
She was once they made her one.
I had no choice.
She was their property.
They would've killed my son for trying to take her.
You're under arrest for the murder of Isabella Valdez.
It's really nice of you to babysit.
Come here, baby. Come here!
Yeah. I didn't know how I was going to get Lyds here
to my big box going-away party.
Copy department knows how to throw a party,
That's for sure.
T.J.!
What's up, buddy? Oh. Oh, no. I...
I-I-I can't be near animals.
Here you go, take that.
I got to go.
Wait. Y-you're allergic to dogs?
All dogs?
Take a shower.
And call me -- oh. Oh. Oh.
Stuart.
Take a shower?
Uh, well, you know, we can still babysit.
Yeah, um, if you want to go somewhere, you know,
or do something.
Take advantage of the free babysitting.
Well, I can't go to the big box party, so...
we could go for a walk?
Yeah, sure.
I'd like that.
Have fun.
Bye.
Who's that?
Yeah!
High five, baby.
You don't want to go with that weirdo strawberry. No.
What do we do if Lydia chooses strawberry over pets?
Then auntie Jane goes rogue again.
We need to discuss your lawless behavior.
Not in front of the nephew, Maura.
Me. Me. Can I hold you?
