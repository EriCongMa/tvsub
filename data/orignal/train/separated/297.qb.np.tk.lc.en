and , time .
37 minutes ,
we got from the apartment to the subway ,
to the pastery school in record time .
i mean , i &apos;m not wearing a bra ,
and my thong might be on backwards .
there is no wrong way to wear a thong ,
as long as it &apos;s uncomfortable .
and with you , the bra is just for decoration .
i have to wear one because you get a ticket
for not put the kids in a car seat .
see you in class guys , i gotta say good bye to my wife .
you think i was gonna kiss you ?
yes .
i &apos;m the wife , you are the husband
who i caught wearing my cloth one day ,
but i don &apos;t say anything about it .
morning , guys .
oh , hi , bebe .
surprised to see me , right ?
everyone always thinks i &apos;m not gonna make it through the night ,
but here i am , even surprised myself .
what &apos;s it like working in an office
with someone who &apos;s about to snap like a breadstick ?
not as much fun as you &apos;d think .
but bebe &apos;s sweet , and working here
is putting you through pastry school .
okay , bye .
bye .
i want a divorce .
i already filed .
hey , wife , i need $ 5
to pay for a spatula i broke yesterday .
i was having a gordon ramsay moment .
脾气火爆 时常骂人
i &apos;d have sex with him , by the way .
why ? he &apos;d just be yelling at you
and telling you you &apos;re doing it wrong .
yeah , sex .
take it . it &apos;s in my purse .
yo , bebe , you got any extra pills you &apos;re not taking ?
no , i &apos;m taking them all .
oh , my god , no .
what ? i just wanted one . or two .
just to take the edge off .
i have a whipped cream final at 3 : 00 .
no . in the obituaries .
i know this person .
&quot; antonia florentino , 80,
died peacefully in her sleep . &quot;
that &apos;s a suicide , right ?
she was my nanny .
you still have a nanny ?
lucky .
she took care of me most of my childhood .
i loved her so much .
so sorry .
that &apos;s kind of how i felt
about my old neighbor , carla .
i mean , she didn &apos;t take care of me ,
but when i was a kid , she used to let me
drink out of her hose .
the last time i saw antonia , she was driving me
and a sloppy nelly furtado to the teen choice awards .
oh , are we allowed to cry at work now ?
&apos;cause i only do it in my car .
max , you know what i just realized ?
this is the first time i &apos;ve been here since my nanny died .
you just said that at chipotle .
and then you said it again ten minutes later ,
also at chipotle .
show some sensitivity .
i was crying because my nanny died .
and also because our grief brunch was at chipotle .
caroline , your nanny passed ?
my sympathies , sweetheart . that &apos;s a shame .
but there is nothing better than a black funeral .
i &apos;m still hung over from my grandpa &apos;s in &apos; 84 .
earl , my nanny was white .
your nanny was white ?
child , you were rich .
have you seen han ?
the funeral &apos;s in philadelphia tomorrow ,
and i need the day off .
well , i think i saw him earlier .
but then again , it might have been a cat .
hey , we both need the day off .
i &apos;m going with you for moral support /
my first cheesesteak /
i want to ride the liberty bell like a wrecking ball .
i just read the craziest article in this popular science
about white dwarfs , black holes , and uranus .
oh , no . let me start over .
han , we need tomorrow off . my nanny died .
she was like a mother to me .
but she was not your mother .
and diner rules clearly state
you can only take off for the death of a family member .
well , the rules also say no drinking on the job ,
but ...
okay , yes , you can go .
because in my culture ,
it &apos;s important to honor the elderly .
i shared a bunk bed with a 97 @-@ year @-@ old
till i was 22 .
were you on the top or bottom ?
oh , i was always the bottom .
oh , no . let me start over .
hey , caroline .
i got your nanny death text .
so i &apos;m wearing black out of respect .
and also , i got my period .
thanks , sophie . that &apos;s lovely .
it is ? which part ?
you know , back in poland when my nanny died ,
i was so heartbroken , i could barely eat her .
you ate your dead nanny ?
well , a goat &apos;s a goat .
it doesn &apos;t matter what you name it .
it &apos;s still good goat meat .
all right , i &apos;ll be in my booth .
i &apos;m going to order a tuna melt and three midol , please .
wait , how are we gonna get there ?
oh , bebe said she had a car , we can just ask her .
i don &apos;t want to get in a car with her .
i don &apos;t even want to get in a conversation with her .
i can drive you .
we just have to stop at my sister &apos;s in bucks county ,
pick up an unmarked package ,
and swing by connecticut to drop it off .
oleg , is there anything illegal about this delivery ?
no , it &apos;s just some shoes ...
stuffed with cocaine .
also the shoes are made of hashish .
i &apos;ll call bebe .
okay , but i &apos;m sitting in the back
&apos;cause i don &apos;t want the crazy to get on me .
bebe , i can &apos;t thank you enough
for driving us to the funeral .
we &apos;re only going 20 . you can go faster if you want .
yeah , we just got passed by a tree .
and i &apos;m especially thrilled your nervous cocker spaniel
with gas and hot spots got to join us .
okay , now you &apos;re going 100 .
we can go slower if you want .
sorry . extremes-- that &apos;s my thing .
one time i moved to tokyo for a day .
max , it just hit me again .
i know .
it &apos;s like she feeds him broccoli .
no .
that antonia is really dead .
well , the good news is , according to yelp ,
she &apos;s dead about two blocks
from the famous philly cheesesteak place .
max , show some respect .
well , i didn &apos;t know her .
in fact , i only know her as the lady who brought me
and cheesesteaks together .
even though we &apos;ve never met , it &apos;ll mean so much
to antonia &apos;s family that i came out of respect .
it &apos;ll mean so much to my therapist
that i left my safe zone
and only brought one of the dogs .
max , do you think in addition to my eulogy ,
i should read something from my childhood journal ?
i don &apos;t , but i think you &apos;re gonna do it anyway .
&quot; christmas morning , 1997 .
antonia woke me up with a cup of hot cocoa
and my favorite peppermint stick ,
and then we opened presents . &quot;
christmas morning , 1997 .
i threw cold water on my mother &apos;s face .
new year &apos;s day-- still no movement .
this is the only picture i still have of us .
it was our first halloween together .
i was four .
look at that cute little baby chick costume she made me .
peep , peep .
aw , so cute .
car .
i never had a halloween costume .
i used to put my hair in a messy bun
and stumble from door @-@ to @-@ door
telling people i was my mother .
this halloween , i went as my doctor , michael .
and i dressed up my buddy here
as his lover , joseph .
we lost .
antonia was always there for me--
halloween , christmas , easter-- every holiday .
really , every day .
she was really like a mother to me .
where was your real mother ?
hey , what kind of dog is that ?
i mean , besides &quot; sad &quot; ?
her mother had an affair , got pushed out .
that &apos;s her hot spot , so don &apos;t lick it .
it &apos;s okay , max , i don &apos;t need any protection .
you don &apos;t need protection ?
who are you , every guy i &apos;ve ever dated ?
bebe , yes , my mother was unfaithful to my father ,
so she was sent away .
but i had antonia and she took care of me .
she was my family .
that must have been hard . everybody needs a mother .
i &apos;d be crazy without my mother .
she drives me to all my appointments .
but you drive .
yeah ...
but i &apos;m not supposed to .
it &apos;s okay i asked bebe to wait in the car , right ?
i mean , she &apos;ll be okay . we cracked a window .
yeah , and she &apos;s got a bowl and a chew @-@ toy .
come on , let &apos;s sign in .
max , i have to keep it together when i meet the family .
i can &apos;t be all emotional .
look , my hand &apos;s shaking . this is terrible .
what ? it was a terrible signature .
and there were only five other names on the page .
get rid of it .
&quot; get rid of it &quot; ?
who are you , every guy i &apos;ve ever dated ?
&quot; caroline channing . &quot;
here , max .
oh , look .
the flowers and everything are so beautiful .
there you go .
you signed &quot; phil e. cheesesteak &quot; ?
you told me not to mention it anymore ,
so it &apos;s just a reminder .
okay , max , there are gonna be a lot of people
who will want my attention , so please be patient
and stand next to me for the occasional supportive lean .
and if someone starts to get too weepy ,
push them out of the way
because i can &apos;t get tears on this dress .
it has to be back to barneys by 9 : 00 a.m.
you &apos;re here .
here we go , max .
i was talking to him .
of course you were . it &apos;s a very sad day for us all .
that was rough .
max , look .
this is antonia .
she looks really nice .
she was .
i didn &apos;t know she was in the military .
but it does explain those fabulous bed sheet corners .
wait , you didn &apos;t know your nanny was a marine ?
that &apos;s too bad , &apos; cause i &apos;d be all ,
&quot; yo , other little rich kid !
my nanny can snap your neck . &quot;
oh , look . there are her sisters , cecelia and angela ,
and there are her nieces and nephews .
and there is not me anywhere .
you know , my picture must be in the coffin
with the other v.i.p.s.
if you &apos;re a v.i.p. , can we get some bottle service ?
good afternoon , ladies .
i &apos;m anthony , antonia &apos;s nephew .
it &apos;s sad day , huh ?
yes , it is .
think i just got a little less sad .
oh ! anthony !
stop . we &apos;re family .
i &apos;m caroline channing .
you &apos;re caroline &quot; hot , &quot; is all i know .
you ladies need cash envelopes
or you guys cool ?
i always need a cash envelope .
i &apos;m sorry , envelopes for what ?
well , at italian wakes , the mourners give the family
a donation after they view the deceased .
so it &apos;s pay @-@ per @-@ view ?
that was a good one .
hey , you want to go get a pop later ?
we &apos;re leaving right after , but yes , anthony .
thank you . we &apos;ll take an envelope .
the body &apos;s right through there .
go right ahead .
anthony , stop .
i &apos;m really nervous .
i &apos;ve never seen a dead body before .
i &apos;ve seen a bunch .
a couple of them were my fault .
i don &apos;t have any cash .
do you have any money ?
let me check my wallet .
this is a real ziploc , not one of those knock @-@ offs .
make sure you seal the envelope ,
so people think it &apos;s all quarters .
max , we &apos;re next .
i &apos;m afraid . hold my hand .
hold hands ? what are we ?
on a christianmingle fifth date ?
please , max . i &apos;m nervous .
oh , god .
thank you .
okay . now give it back .
what ? that was just my longest relationship .
plus , i need it to put this change in the envelope .
oh , she looks so peaceful .
hi , antonia . it &apos;s me , caroline .
should i kiss her ? the family is right there watching .
the lady before us kissed her .
go for it . doesn &apos;t look like she &apos;d fight you .
okay , on the count of three .
one , two--
no ! max , hold my hand again while i--
what do we do ?
wait , leave it ! we were giving it to them anyway .
not all of it . that &apos;s our cheesesteak money .
leave it . come on .
i am so , so sorry about that .
my nerves got the best of me . you understand .
i &apos;m cecelia , antonia &apos;s--
sister . i know .
i see the resemblance .
i &apos;m caroline .
caroline who ?
oh . caroline channing .
caroline channing who ?
you &apos;re having a hard time processing . understandable .
it &apos;s been a very emotional day for us all .
who is this girl ?
you , i feel like i &apos;ve seen somewhere .
are you ricky &apos;s girl from rochester ?
i could be . what &apos;s in it for me ?
antonia used to take care of me when i was little .
oh , antonia was your baby @-@ sitter .
very nice of you to come .
well , she was hardly my &quot; baby @-@ sitter . &quot;
she took care of me every day for ten years .
caroline . caroline channing .
i &apos;m sorry , but i don &apos;t know who you are , sweetheart ,
though it seems to be what you &apos;re hammering me about .
if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i need a cigarette .
and then i got to remove
some of those pennies off of my sister .
it &apos;s a coffin , not a wishing well .
this funeral turned out to be very depressing .
well , yeah .
dead body in the room , generally a buzz @-@ kill .
unless it &apos;s an irish wake--
then you &apos;re playing beer pong off the coffin .
no , i mean , how is it possible
that the family doesn &apos;t even know me ?
did antonia never even mention me ?
let &apos;s focus on the positive .
anthony really liked your ass .
i know what antonia and i had .
this is what we had .
peep , peep .
that &apos;s what we had .
well , that &apos;s a lot .
but i guess no one in this family wants to admit that ,
and it &apos;s a shame too ,
because i had a great eulogy .
you do ?
yes . i do .
would you like me to share it with you ?
i most certainly would .
you are not seriously eulogy @-@ bombing
that old lady , are you ?
she asked me about my great eulogy .
she &apos;s a hundred .
she probably thought you said you had a great urologist .
do you have a pen ?
i &apos;m getting the name of her doctor .
no , ma &apos;am , i didn &apos;t say , &quot; urologist . &quot;
i said , &quot; eulogy . &quot; a great eulogy .
why would you give the eulogy ?
because i &apos;m caroline channing .
who ?
caroline channing .
caroline channing .
antonia was my nanny .
my family was rich ,
but then my father robbed everyone ,
and we became the scourge of society ,
overshadowed a little bit by mel gibson
hating the jews that same week .
surely , you remember ?
honey , i don &apos;t even remember how i got here .
i can &apos;t believe this .
i constructed my entire &quot; happy &quot; childhood
on the fact that even though my mom left
and apparently didn &apos;t love me ,
antonia did .
and now i get here and i realize
no one loved me , i was just a paycheck .
one of the many kids she baby @-@ sat .
i don &apos;t even know why i bothered to come .
i &apos;m going to the restroom and then we can just leave .
excuse me . hi .
max , ricky &apos;s girl .
i know this is a hard time for you ,
but it &apos;s a hard time for my friend as well .
and even though you never heard of her ,
i was wondering if you could just go over there ,
and say you just remembered her ,
and that antonia talked about her all the time ?
i know it &apos;s a 180 on your original story and a lie ,
and i &apos;d offer to pay you for your trouble ,
but my 401k is laying in that box on top of your sister .
look , i only permitted you two to stay
&apos;cause your ricky was so nice to uncle joe
when he fell off the roof last year .
but now , you gotta go .
okay . be that way .
but don &apos;t expect ricky to pick up uncle joe for dialysis .
max , what are you doing ?
the family asked me to put it up .
they just remembered you .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m so pathetic , you have to put up my picture
to make me feel better ?
in a way , yes .
it belongs up there .
who wouldn &apos;t want to know that kid ?
nice to meet you , antonia .
please don &apos;t haunt us .
now , let &apos;s hit the road and get some freaking cheesesteaks !
max , please take that down .
it &apos;s so embarrassing .
nobody here knows anything about me .
they didn &apos;t know me either , chicken .
hey , who you callin &apos; chicken ?
me . that was antonia &apos;s nickname for me .
you know who i am ?
of course i do .
antonia &apos;s little chick , her peep .
she loved you .
and she loved making you that costume .
took the whole kitchen table up with all those sequins ,
but she knew you deserved to sparkle .
she loved you so much , i couldn &apos;t begin to complain .
i &apos;m so sorry . what was your name ?
i &apos;m meg o &apos;hara . i was her roommate .
and lover .
we were together 30 years .
the military !
i know , right ? i mean , come on .
that &apos;s me with my arm around her on that tank .
and the family still had no clue .
vintage lez-- very cool .
i know toni would have wanted you to have these .
oh , thanks for coming , chicken .
you &apos;re probably the only person in the world
who loved her as purely as i did .
max , look .
christmas .
and my birthday .
and the teen choice awards .
i &apos;m sorry for your loss .
thank you .
philly cheesesteaks for everybody !
and you really haven &apos;t lived
until you &apos;ve driven two hours in a chevy
with nine cheesesteaks and a gassy animal .
what ? i ate mine in the car .
hey , earl , you missed one hell of a funeral .
you should have come .
there were some hot octogenarians ,
and i got a definite &quot; jungle fever &quot; vibe from one of them .
girl , at my age , you don &apos;t go anywhere near funerals .
you accidentally doze off , you spend six hours
digging yourself out of the ground .
hey , how you holding up , chicken ?
i &apos;m okay . thanks .
and max , when i die ,
i don &apos;t care who else is at my funeral ,
as long as you &apos;re there .
of course i &apos;ll be there .
the murderer always shows up to throw off the cops .
also , save the money on a casket
and just toss me in a hole wearing dior and a smoky eye .
unless i &apos;m fat-- then burn me .
well , i don &apos;t want a funeral .
when i die , just shove my corpse into a cannon
and blow me directly into the trump casino .
