hey , mom ...
listen to this card dad got for grandpa jay .
&quot; hip @-@ hip @-@ hip @-@ hooray ! &quot;
hip有嘿或是屁股的意思
&quot; save the extra hip .
you &apos;ll need it someday . &quot;
&apos;cause he &apos;s old !
you &apos;re not giving him that .
if he drinks his other gift first ?
nope .
ladies ...
do you remember exactly one year ago today
when you did not have a gift for your grandfather
and it killed him just a little ?
so i suggested you start interviewing
all the members of the family for a video tribute ?
well , check it and burn -- we totally did that .
almost .
we just need to finish the editing .
and you should talk .
you haven &apos;t even started on your gift yet .
that &apos;s because i changed mine .
i thought of a better idea yesterday .
i think i came up with a better idea .
okay . my dad has a picture
of me and mitchell when we were kids ,
standing in our old backyard .
we &apos;re gonna re @-@ create the picture .
i did the same thing last year for my parents for christmas ,
and it went over like gangbusters .
mm . funny .
do you remember ?
oh , i do . i do .
i do .
come on , girls , tv off .
it &apos;s your grandfather &apos;s birthday .
we got to start taking this seriously .
permission to come aboard .
my best birthday memory--
i &apos;m a teenager , and for some reason ,
i drag this boat out on the lake .
and for hours , i &apos;m just lying there , fishing ,
alone with my thoughts .
fantastic .
that &apos;s all i want this year .
so that &apos;s really going to be your day ?
you &apos;re going fishing ?
with time out for a gourmet lunch .
sausage of the month club really nailed it in may .
but , honey , no offense .
they almost lost me last month
with that chorizo .
why &quot; no offense &quot; ?
it &apos;s a sausage . it &apos;s not on our flag .
lily , what are you doing here ?
surprise !
we were just on our way to get jay &apos;s cake
and thought we &apos;d pop by .
lily was driving me crazy all morning .
i had to get rid of her .
she refuses to get dressed .
well , did you try bribing her ?
oh , no .
of -- of course i did !
i cannot go back in there , mitchell .
why did we ever decide to have a kid ? !
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know !
oh , come on !
she loves you so much .
just this morning , she was looking at a picture of you ,
and i swear she was trying to say your name .
really ?
ay , i would love to spend more time with her ,
bt i have to go to the mall to get jay &apos;s gift for his birthday .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , sweetie . gloria &apos;s busy .
no , don &apos;t cry .
we should go .
oh , maybe i can take her wi--
okay . bag &apos;s packed . have fun .
bye , sweetie .
hey , cam .
oh , hey , manny .
mom , is jay still here ?
no , he just left .
shoot .
why ? what &apos;s up , pal ?
i &apos;m going over to a friend &apos;s house
where i may have to use this thing .
i only used it once ,
and that was to take a torte out of the oven .
okay , well , first , let &apos;s loosen this thing up .
so what &apos;s her name ?
how &apos;d you know ?
well , you &apos;re pretending to be something you &apos;re not .
boys do that for girls ... or really dreamy boys .
her name &apos;s tara . we have great chats online .
she &apos;s really smart and funny ,
but she &apos;s on the softball team .
well , nobody &apos;s perfect .
hey , you know what ?
why don &apos;t we go outside and toss the ball around ?
okay .
and you know what ? i wouldn &apos;t worry too much .
she &apos;s gonna like you even if sports aren &apos;t your thing .
aren &apos;t my thing ?
i have a tennis racket upstairs
i only use as a bubble @-@ bath frother .
how do you put this on ?
excuse me , miss .
sorry .
you answered to &quot; miss &quot; !
aha ! hilarious .
glen whipple , my college rival --
captain of cheer squad .
won every robot battle .
every second i spent with the guy
just made me feel worse about myself .
the only thing i could compete with him in
was close @-@ up magic .
well , it &apos;s great to see you .
great to see you , too .
and i believe this is yours .
what ? when ?
hey , you headed over to the card shop ?
i was in there earlier .
i got myself one of those musical cards .
oh . they &apos;re a little more expensive , but i can swing it .
oh . well , great to see you . yeah .
by the way , don &apos;t leave without this quarter
from behind your -- come on , phil !
good luck , dunphy .
i &apos;m off to get some new cross @-@ trainers .
i blow through them pretty fast
with all this power @-@ walking i &apos;m into .
catch you later .
phil ?
what are you two doing here ?
shopping for tonight .
oh , well , i &apos;ll walk with you .
where were you heading ?
the card store .
what a beautiful child !
you and your wife must be so happy .
i didn &apos;t think anything of it ...
until other people started making the same mistake .
it reminded me of a college job i had parking cars .
one day , i had to park an aston martin .
i &apos;ll never forget the looks i got
driving that baby down the block .
i wasn &apos;t gonna dent this one .
hey , uh , w @-@ what would you think
about swinging by the shoe store ?
okay , let &apos;s go .
i still can &apos;t believe all the looks we got
driving over here .
and yet you wore the hat the whole time .
don &apos;t you think we should
park on the next block over ?
&apos;cause this is all permit parking .
no , we used to live here . it &apos;s fine .
yeah , still . i ...
i don &apos;t think anybody &apos;s home .
here . hang on to this .
what -- wait , where are you going ?
the backyard . we &apos;ll take this picture really quickly ,
and then we &apos;ll just get out of here .
no , let &apos;s just -- let &apos;s just wait for them to come home .
okay , that -- that &apos;s trespassing !
no , it &apos;s not . we used to live here .
i don &apos;t think that does what you think it does .
of course you would baby out ,
because this is just like pool @-@ hopping all over again .
i just -- i don &apos;t see what was fun about that .
it made going in grandma &apos;s pool less special .
why don &apos;t you try being a little less special ?
is it far ?
hello .
hi , it &apos;s sandra from the dog groomer .
i &apos;m trying to reach gloria .
stella &apos;s ready .
oh , i must have her phone .
she probably grabbed mine again .
listen , this is her husband .
you have my number right there , probably .
give that a call .
okay , thanks .
yeah , it &apos;s me again . i &apos;ll be right there .
yeah i did blame her for no reason .
you have a little bit of an attitude . you know that ?
you know who did your job in my day ?
a hose .
okay , a little to your left , a little to your left .
yes , okay . right there . that &apos;s it . that &apos;s it .
perfect . okay .
and now i must run .
here , okay . fast .
here we go .
it &apos;s weird being back here , isn &apos;t it ?
i know . everything looks exactly the same .
well , you know , except for the fence .
yeah , what &apos;s with that ?
who are they trying to keep out , anyway ?
i know .
oh . oh , god . oh , god .
oh , god .
oh , wow . oh , my god .
no , it &apos;s okay . he might be friendly .
he looks nice .
he looks nice .
hi .
no ! oh , god ! he &apos;s -- quickly , quickly .
not nice . so not nice .
hurry ! hurry , hurry , hurry !
oh ! oh ! oh , go oh , god !
now what do we do ?
well , you could try telling him we used to live here .
they are not coming home .
we need to call someone .
use your phone .
mine &apos;s down there getting rabies on it .
no , i left mine in your car .
what ?
i didn &apos;t want to ruin the line of my pants .
oh , god .
oh , look . somebody &apos;s coming .
no . okay , that is what happens
when you park without a permit .
stop ! that &apos;s ours !
we &apos;re up here ! stop !
he ignored me .
he didn &apos;t stop for the screaming sailor in a tree ?
give me your shoe .
what , you think that wolf down there
is gonna be afraid of a shoe ?
no . no , i don &apos;t .
wh-- what are you doing with dad &apos;s wine ?
getting comfortable .
we could be here for a really long time .
whoa ! where &apos;d you learn how to do that ?
where &apos;d you get a sailor suit on short notice ?
fair enough .
mm @-@ hmm .
ew . it &apos;s merlot .
hello .
manny !
hey , how &apos;d it go with tara ?
it &apos;s still going on .
the catch part went fine ... mostly .
i took a running dive into the dirt .
oh , well , did you at least catch the ball ?
i was trying to throw the ball !
i &apos;m in her bathroom looking for band @-@ aids .
i &apos;m trying to get up the nerve to tell her how i feel .
well , just be honest .
she intimidates me .
every time i open my mouth , i say something stupid .
i called her bedroom &quot; fantazing . &quot;
that &apos;s not even a word !
are you okay in there , manny ?
yeah ! i &apos;m just water @-@ washing my hands !
help me ! tell me what to say .
okay , how about this ...
you are the prettiest , smartest , funniest girl
in the sixth grade .
i know you &apos;re only 11,
but i can &apos;t stop thinking about you .
i &apos;ve loved talking to you online .
i think we should become boyfriend and girlfriend .
no , it &apos;s not what you think .
i &apos;m talking to a little boy .
oh .
hello .
she &apos;s not with me , cam . i got her phone .
why are you crying ?
how do you get kicked out of a bakery ?
well , that &apos;ll do it .
i sorry to ask you to get your own birthday cake ,
but i can &apos;t get ahold of any-- anyone else .
can &apos;t do it . i &apos;m on my way to the lake ...
finally .
just get something at the grocery store .
i am not getting you a grocery @-@ store cake .
gloria asked me to handle this .
she &apos;s gonna yell at me , jay .
she can be mean in spanish !
okay , fine . let &apos;s wrap this up , princess .
okay . love you . bye .
what are you guys doing ?
just editing our birthday tribute to grandpa .
you know , some of the interviews i did
didn &apos;t turn out so well .
that &apos;s okay . we &apos;ll just use the best stuff
from what we all got .
okay , haley , talk about grandpa .
eww .
i can &apos;t talk about grandpa dressed like this .
i love my --
that stupid dog next door !
jay ! jay !

... three , four , five .
hey , uncle mitch , what do you think -- - one , two --
what are you doing ?
n @-@ nothing .

i could &apos;ve sworn we had more !
well , let me work my magic .
it &apos;s all about creative editing .
just give me two hours
and another hour .
somebody get me some chocolate milk
with extra salt .
do you remember the time you quit cub scouts
and dad got mad at you so you ran away up here ?
right . and you brought me my dinner up here ...
... and my comic books .
yep .
i think mom and dad would have been a lot more scared
if you hadn &apos;t been running into the house to use the bathroom .
i can &apos;t go outside .
great , now i &apos;m thinking about it .
mitchell ...
it &apos;s ironic .
we always wanted a dog in this backyard ,
and we could never have one .
y-- manny got one .
mm . manny gets everything .
yeah .
hey , you think manny &apos;s gonna get a third of ...
a third of what ?
you know .
uh ... i guess .
sure . i mean , that seems fair .
right ? does it ?
claire , does it ? &apos; cause i just feel like -- - okay ?
you know what ? i think we &apos;ve probably had enough of this .
okay , wait .
do you think if we could get the dog to chase this doll ,
then we could run down and grab the phone really quick ?
we could do that !
yeah .
we just are gonna have to throw it really , really far .
right . so ...
that way . mm @-@ hmm .
gloria , um , i &apos;d still love to swing by that shoe store .
if you &apos;re in a hurry , go by yourself .
no . i &apos;ll wait . whipple !
whipple !
okay ! mm !
what do you think ?
oh , it &apos;s perfect . uh , l @-@ let &apos;s see the other side .
whipple !
bless you .
thank you .
it &apos;s a little too tight , no ?
what do you think of the tush ?
oh , i think it &apos;s great .
why don &apos;t you keep it right there for a second .
let &apos;s make sure .
yeah , but it &apos;s a little see @-@ through .
maybe if i put this underneath , then it won &apos;t , like , show .
no , no , no , no , no . it looks good that way .
i go try something else better .
no , wait !
wait !
oh , don &apos;t think about it . just get it .
hilarious , whipple . i &apos;m actually here with someone .
and you finally did make something disappear .
she was here a second ago .
of course she was .
just like the date you had on the final @-@ night dance
of junior tumbling congress .
there was traffic .
sure .
i think i found something
that is going to make my husband very happy .
what do you think ?
oh , very happy , gloria .
very happy .
okay , but don &apos;t go far away
because i might need help with the zipper , okay ?
sounds good ... with the zipper .
wow . phil .
i mean , wow . that &apos;s your wife ?
it would appear so .
great to see you , glen .
you know , i got to say , i &apos;m a little surprised .
surprised ...
or mystified ?
damn it . it went down your shirt .
you can ... keep it .
i &apos;ll see ya .

you would marry claire pritchett .

are you kidding ? she was gorgeous .
god , i was so jealous of you back then .
you were jealous of me ?
oh , man .
claire pritchett with the blond hair
and those browes , great smile .
oh , i can picture her smiling right now .

no .
popeye .

but i &apos;m hauling my ass across town
trying to save you two from a little dog .
at least we got to have a dog for a few minutes .

climbing over that fence , i might have wrecked &apos; em .
that &apos;s mature .
i &apos;m sorry .

i &apos;m sorry you said &quot; rectum . &quot;

you never used to talk to me like that
before we got that damn dog .
hey , manny . i almost called you .
how &apos;d it go with tara ?
okay , i guess .
i used every line you gave me , and she totally ate it up .
oh . well , then , why just okay ?
she wants to go on a date now ...
to the batting cage .
not so good with a bat ?
i am , as long as i &apos;m using it to roll out dough .
i &apos;ll bet you just need a little practice .
you know , when i was your age ,
i couldn &apos;t hit a balloon with a bat .
then my father took me out to the field ,
and a couple hours later ,
i was knocking the hide off that ball .
it &apos;s one of the best days we ever had together .
really ?
yeah .
i just bet you need some time in a batting cage .
what are you doing this weekend ?
that &apos;d be fun , huh ?
that &apos;s a great idea !
i &apos;ll ask jay . he loves stuff like this .
that &apos;ll be great for you guys .
yeah .
and thanks for your help today , cam .

i don &apos;t think grandpa &apos;s having the best time .
he keeps going and getting more drinks .
well , not every time .
one time he went in to check on the women &apos;s basketball score .
the sparks are up by 8 , if anyone cares .
okay , dad , we all owe you an apology .
we were so worried about giving you a great night
that we ruined your day ,
and i &apos;m really sorry we didn &apos;t let you go fishing .
sorry , dad .
sorry , jay .

hello .

what are you doing out there ?
what the hell ?
i dragged it back here this afternoon .
i know it &apos;s not the lake ,
but maybe we could pop open a few drinks
and hang out on the water ?
now , the old jay would have said ,
&quot; i wanted to be on a lake with a fishing rod and sunshine ,
not bobbing around at night in a swimming pool . &quot;
i miss the old jay .
this is the life , huh ?
it ain &apos;t half bad .

come on , let &apos;s get in .
so , how was your day with claire ?
you know , it was actually -- it was really great .
i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t always think about it ,
but i @-@ i was really lucky to have her to grow up with .
you know , i cannot imagine
dealing with my crazy parents alone .
yeah .
