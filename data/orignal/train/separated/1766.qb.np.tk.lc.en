leonard , what time does your mom &apos;s plane get in ?
i don &apos;t know-- some time tomorrow morning .
don &apos;t you want to know for sure ?
no need to .
as soon as she flies into california airspace ,
i &apos;ll feel a disturbance in the force .
it &apos;s so nice both of your moms are coming in
to see you guys get an award .
well , my mother &apos;s been there for every honor i &apos;ve won
since i beat out my twin sister
for the &quot; did it on the potty &quot; trophy .
how does this look ?
aw , it &apos;s so nice . she &apos;s gonna love it .
sure , his mom gets roses .
when i want them ,
they &apos;re a &quot; bouquet of severed plant genitals . &quot;
you act like i didn &apos;t get you
that mushroom log on valentine &apos;s day .
he &apos;s right .
roses die , but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms
for two or three magical years .
you know , your mom &apos;s never been too thrilled with our relationship .
maybe i should get her something so she warms up to me .
if you could run out and get a phd ,
that might make her like you .
really ? it didn &apos;t work for you .
do you think the moms will get along ?
uh , i don &apos;t know . they &apos;re pretty different .
maybe they &apos;ll be best friends .
one of them is brilliant , one is sweet and simple .
sound familiar ?
shelly , i &apos;m so proud of you and leonard for getting this award .
oh , thank you , mother .
i tried to read your paper , but it was very hard
for me to understand .
oh , it &apos;s quite straightforward , actually .
it describes a new model of the universe
that conceptualizes it as the surface
of an n @-@ dimensional superfluid .
interesting .
you can believe that ,
but god filling an ark with animals two @-@ by @-@ two is nonsense .
what did they feed the lions , mother ?
the floating bodies of drowned sinners , of course .
listen , leonard &apos;s mom is a renowned psychiatrist
and woman of science .
can you please keep the bible babble to yourself
while she &apos;s here ?
are you ashamed of me ?
of course not . i love you .
i &apos;m just embarrassed by the things you believe , do and say .
well , i love you , too .
my little bowl of lion chow .
so , have you and penny set a wedding date ?
no , we &apos;re kind of taking it slow .
i see .
what does that mean ?
you &apos;ve been on and off with this woman for seven years
and engaged for one year .
one has to wonder if there &apos;s a problem .
are you having satisfactory intercourse ?
yes , mother .
only satisfactory . i see .
i change my answer .
it @-@ it &apos;s amazing . it &apos;s hot .
we can barely keep our hands off each other .
seems odd to try and impress your mother
with your sexual prowess .
but then , you always did have that unresolved oedipal complex .
see , this right here , what you &apos;re doing ,
can you please not do that around sheldon &apos;s mom ?
why ? are you attracted to her , too ?
of course not .
she &apos;s @-@ she &apos;s just a very sweet and god @-@ fearing lady ,
and you have to be respectful of her beliefs .
leonard , i &apos;m an adult .
i know how to conduct myself around people
from different walks of life .
thank you .
where is she from again ?
east texas .
hey , look who &apos;s here .
oh , dr. hofstadter , it &apos;s so good to see you again .
likewise .
i read your paper ; it was very impressive .
oh , thank you .
we just spent two hours in traffic .
did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper ?
of course i did , but it &apos;s a mother &apos;s job
to make sure her child &apos;s self @-@ esteem
is not dependent on anyone &apos;s approval .
that &apos;s so sweet , you think i have self @-@ esteem .
dr. hofstadter , i want you to meet my mother , mary .
so nice to meet you .
nice to meet you , too . how was your flight ?
very pleasant . and yours ?
lovely . almost as if someone--
not saying who-- was watching over the plane .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
subtle , mom , real subtle .
stuart .
morning .
we talked about this .
i don &apos;t mind you still living here ,
but we got to have some rules .
and rule number one is pants .
you must be very proud of your son .
oh , yes .
he recently argued a case before the supreme court .
he did ?
oh , you mean this son .
uh , sure , he &apos;s terrific .
uh , beverly , would you like to see the math i worked out
to support our hypothesis ?
uh , you mean , my hypothesis .
i hypothesized it all by myself .
calm down , dear .
mary , i &apos;m curious .
when did you first realize
that your son had such a remarkable mind ?
ooh , good question .
everyone loves stories about sheldon cooper , boy genius .
well , i would have to say when he was 13
and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed .
ooh , this is a good one .
now , the first thing you have to know about shelly is
ever since he was a little boy ,
he was always concerned with the well @-@ being of others .
and he didn &apos;t think that it was fair
for people to pay for electricity ,
so he was gonna power the entire town for free .
tell her about the uranium !
tell her about the uranium .
oh , well !
oh , this is adorable .
when he arranged to get some yellowcake from chad ,
i thought he was talking about twinkies
from one of his friends .
but i wasn &apos;t .
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t have any friends .
no .
it turns out that this little scallywag was trying
to use my visa card to buy uranium
from an african warlord in the country of chad !
sounds like sheldon was a handful .
oh , he was a handful .
i was a handful .
you still are .
uh , mom , hey , tell mary the story
about how i made a van de graaff generator
out of our vacuum cleaner .
all right .
he broke the vacuum cleaner .
i mean , for a while , everything was vampires .
now it &apos;s all zombies .
i wonder what the next monster fad will be .
we haven &apos;t had a good invisible man in a while .
clearly , you &apos;ve never seen me try to talk to a woman .
guys .
in the time you &apos;ve been sitting here playing video games ,
i got the car washed , picked up cleaning supplies
and went to the bank .
i put on pants .
kiss @-@ ass .
okay , i don &apos;t know when i became
the mother to three lazy teenagers ,
but it stops today .
you guys are cleaning the kitchen , top to bottom .
hey , i don &apos;t even live here .
yes or no , do you have clothes in my laundry right now ?
i do .
and some of it &apos;s wool ,
so dry flat if possible .
oh , and here &apos;s a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree .
you don &apos;t look very happy .
well , i had just begun puberty .
it was figuratively and literally
one of the hairiest moments of my life .
shelly does not like change .
oh , true .
but all the clenching in the world will not keep
testicles in your abdomen .
hey , sorry , got caught up at work .
hi , beverly !
hello .
oh , okay .
sorry , i forgot .
you remember my mother .
oh , yes . hi , mary !
good to see you again , dear .
ah , yeah , now that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
so , mom , you haven &apos;t seen penny since we got engaged .
oh , yeah , let me show you the ring .
oh , lovely .
must have been very expensive .
oh , no , not at all .
no , we , uh , found a place online
that , uh , repurposes diamond drill bits .
we did not . that &apos;s not true .
can i speak to you alone for a second ?
oh , sure .
it came from tiffany &apos;s .
you mean the box , right ?
keep walking !
really doesn &apos;t matter to me how much he spent on the ring .
i think .
did i misspeak about the ring ?
yes , and we &apos;ll get back to that .
but , uh , even with your mother here ,
you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom .
you &apos;re like one of those elephant seal pups
that steals the milk from two mothers !
do you mean what marine biologists
refer to as &quot; super weaning &quot; ?
yes , you are a super weaner !
well , now i have to correct you .
a @-@ as a bit of an elephant seal buff ,
the more accurate comparison
would be when two mother seals
actively seek to nourish the same pup .
so i believe the term you &apos;re looking for
is a double mother suckler .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
that is the term i &apos;m looking for .
you are a dirty double mother suckler !
okay , well , now that we have the terminology straightened out .
how dare you !
we &apos;re not in a rush .
we &apos;ll set a date when the time is right .
it doesn &apos;t matter , sweetie .
the moment a man lays with a woman ,
they are married in the eyes of the lord .
the bible is &quot; uch &quot; to you ?
no , i &apos;m sorry . that was inappropriate .
as a psychiatrist ,
i know how important people &apos;s superstitions can be to them .
you want to talk about superstitions ?
sheldon sent me the books you wrote--
all that nonsense about superegos and ids .
what bull dropped that on the barn floor ?
his name is sigmund freud .
hey , look at that !
you both believe in jewish bearded guys .
stay out of this .
at least the bearded man that i believe in
preaches love and compassion .
all yours talks about is
why you hold in your poop
and want to crawl back inside your mama .
it &apos;s fascinating .
how can someone as enlightened as sheldon
come from someone like you ?
i know the answer .
you &apos;re not gonna like it .
try me .
when i was pregnant with shelly , i was driving to church ,
and i was praying to the lord
to give me a son smarter than his dumb @-@ ass daddy .
and i looked over and i saw a jesus bobblehead
in the subaru next to me nodding yes .
what is that supposed to mean ?
it means ...
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re having this conversation .
well , do it some more .
maybe you can knock some sense into yourself .
i hope we all stops hitting ourselves
and talk about something safe , you know ,
like shoes or how cute little chinese babies are .
maybe it is not my fault that your mother likes me
better than she likes you !
oh , don &apos;t flatter yourself !
she likes everybody better than she likes me !
how old is this jell @-@ o ?
well , it &apos;s carrots , so gonna say very .
sorry we have to do this .
bernadette &apos;s not wrong .
she does work hard around here .
yeah , maybe it &apos;s a good thing
if she stops babying you so much .
she doesn &apos;t baby me .
i saw her pull you home in a wagon .
for your information ,
i twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck .
face it , dude ,
bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to ,
and that was not a healthy relationship .
you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s time for me
to act like an adult in this marriage .
starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash .
bernie , i made a mess !
i &apos;m terribly sorry that i upset your mother .
oh , it &apos;s all right . she &apos;ll forgive you .
she has to or she goes to hell .
i can &apos;t help but notice
how her unconditional love for you
is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies .
well , you doled out affection
as a reward for achievement--
a proven way to raise a child .
or train a rat .
but look how well you turned out .
i &apos;d feign modesty at this point , but who would believe me ?
still , you need to consider
how successful leonard &apos;s brother and sister are .
i suppose .
while my brother and sister are mouth @-@ breathing idiots .
do you suppose you would &apos;ve flourished more
in a reward @-@ based environment ?
perhaps .
but my mom made me spaghetti
with chopped @-@ up hot dogs whenever i wanted ,
so who cares ?
not once did my mother ever give me any love
or affection for just being myself ;
i always had to earn it .
oh , leonard , i &apos;m sure she loves you very much .
in her own cold godless way .
yeah , and you certainly don &apos;t have to earn my love .
thank you .
of course , you already knew that
when you bought me this princess @-@ cut drill bit .
that &apos;s not what it is .
i know , i know .
when your mom gets back , i &apos;m gonna need
to apologize for the way i spoke to her .
well , come on now , she did kind of start it .
doesn &apos;t matter ; a good christian would &apos;ve turned the other cheek .
on the other hand ,
a good texan would &apos;ve shot her , so ...
i just kind of split the difference .
hey , who &apos;s in the mood for spaghetti and hot dogs ?
oh , me !
yeah , me , too !
coming up .
i don &apos;t really feel i deserve it .
that was a big sticky mess ,
but ... i think i got it .
looks good .
look at that .
you cleaned it up all by yourself .
yes , i cleaned it up all by myself .
honestly , i don &apos;t know why you complain so ...
okay , maybe i missed one spot .
just leave .
i &apos;m so glad that you and i were able to bury the hatchet .
me , too .
and i respect your right to your beliefs .
and i will pray for you .
okay , mom , let &apos;s get you back to your hotel
before anyone says anything else .
one moment .
there &apos;s something i need to say to you .
oh , really ? that &apos;s too bad .
leonard , i always made you earn my affection ,
but today i realize that
there &apos;s more than one way to raise a child .
i taught her that !
therefore , i would like
to initiate a new protocol wherein i ...
shower you with unconditional love .
when does that start ?
so needy .
come to mommy .
it &apos;s okay , go ahead .
oh , my son .
oh , my mother .
oh , my god .
* it &apos;s a hard @-@ knock life *
