,We are just now getting word of a story
在香港抓捕归案
developing out of Hong Kong.
Sources say authorities there have apprehended
legendary criminal Raymond Reddington.
He's been on the FBI's most wanted list
longer than any other fugitive,
but tonight, sources are confirming
Reddington was arrested in Hong Kong just hours ago.
Reddington was once a rising star at the Pentagon.
Sources say he was being groomed for admiral when,
on Christmas eve, 1990, while on his way home...
...to visit his wife and daughter, Reddington vanished.
Four years later, Reddington resurfaced
and was charged with treason in absentia
for selling top-secret American intelligence to foreign states.
From this point forward, you don't exist.
That's a load off.
Just hours ago,
the U.S. State Department confirmed Reddington
has been remanded into U.S. custody,
but officials will not comment on his current location.
Reddington's off the radar.
What do you mean?
We don't know where Reddington is?
CIA's not saying.
Why not? Reddington's our asset.
Only 41 people in the U.S. government know that.
I've talked to all of them. Nobody knows where he is.
He's been on the run for 25 years.
His arrest was bound to happen.
No, Reddington moves too fluidly to get caught up in something
as obvious as a public assassination in Hong Kong.
No, he wanted this to happen.
What if he didn't?
Why would Mr. Reddington want to get captured?
His arrest happened overseas.
We have to assume he wanted proximity to something.
Well, if he's grabbed,
it's either by the CIA ground branch or J.S.O.C.
You think it's an intelligence apparatus that's holding him?
Scrub our sources at Langley, and do it fast.
Once they drop him in whatever hole he's headed for...
he's not coming back.
202-555-0151.
You speak when you're spoken to.
202-555-0151.
Call the number.
Ask for a Houseman.
Call the number.
$50,000 will be transferred into the account of your choice.
$50,000.
All I want is two minutes with your warden.
All right. We found him.
We got him.
CIA analyst at Langley confirmed they're holding Reddington
at an off-book lockdown called the Factory.
That's bad news. That's really bad news.
That place is real?
The Factory?
Wait, what's the Factory?
It's a level-10 detention facility
specifically designed to process detainees
who've been trained to withstand interrogation and torture.
Assets are brought in, information is squeezed out --
data, intel, anything that may be of value.
This place is a slaughterhouse for spies.
They reduce them to ones and zeroes.
What's left is a husk that either rots away behind bars
or is executed outright.
We've got to get him out of there.
You think the CIA's gonna let us talk to him,
just walk right in there? No.
He's our asset.
No, they're gonna keep him all to themselves.
If he went to this Factory on purpose,
I suspect it was to make contact with somebody
he couldn't get to on the outside.
Reddington gave up 25 years of freedom to see this guy.
I want to know who he is
and what intel he's got that's so damned important.
Master Sergeant Desmond says you offered him a bribe.
Care to explain?
Within 12 hours, inmate Luther Todd Braxton
will break out of his cell.
When he does, he will steal a classified intelligence packet
that contains secrets vital to your national security.
The means for his escape and his team are already in place.
This story feels like a desperate last gasp
from a dying man.
Could be.
Regardless, if you don't move quickly,
the prison will be overrun
and the dozens of innocent men and women
who operate this facility will be subdued and executed,
beginning with you.
Luther Braxton is in solitary.
Not for long.
He's not cooperating.
Take him back to his cell. We go again in two hours.
Agent Cooper, Kat Goodson.
As you know, the director has brought me here
to liaison with your task force.
Of course. We've met -- the correspondents' dinner.
You were the scotch -- neat.
Please, tell us what you know.
I'm not at liberty to say.
The Clandestine Service is aware of the arrangement
your task force has with Reddington.
It's why we're running point through your office.
Well, then perhaps the director should've notified me
before sending Reddington to the Factory.
The section chief sent a cable from the warden.
Said that Raymond Reddington claims that a detainee,
one Luther Braxton, poses a national security threat,
and we're hoping that you can tell us something
about their connection.
I don't know.
Who's Luther Braxton?
Braxton is a thief.
Interpol's been hunting him for years.
He plans his heists to occur in the midst of chaos.
He is organized, meticulous, and he is bloody.
He stole $282 million from Baghdad
in the middle of Operation Shock and Awe,
abducted a CIA asset out of Iran
during the '09 election protests.
Later, he sold his secrets to Beijing.
The CIA announced his death two months ago.
We say that about a lot of the inmates at the Factory.
Truth is Braxton's being interrogated for secrets
he stole from the Chinese, from the Iranians, us.
Well, my money's on the fact that these two
have a history together.
Reddington, Braxton -- they're planning something.
Whatever it is, you're going to find out.
Oh, we don't have authorization.
You do now. Get to Reddington.
Find out what he's up to.
Hey, Braxton, chow!
We have a code Oscar, block "B," dorm six!
Activate critical response!
We need an emergency response team in block "B" now!
Get away from the door! Fire one!
Hands -- hands up! Get on the ground!
Tell me what you know.
I tried. It's too late.
You've lost your facility.
No, you tell me I'm gonna have an escape before it happens.
Now you're getting evac'd out?
Why the hell am I getting evac'd out?
Orders from up top.
Bureau's been cleared to send a team, incoming now.
Radio that chopper. Tell them to turn around.
Why?
We got a problem.
What's happening here?
E.R.F. failed.
Radio the chopper.
They're sending in the riot squad.
Get him to the evac team!
Radio the chopper!
Back up, back up!
Inmate number 2532, Xavier Chavez.
I know this name.
He was a court-martialed special operator out of Fort Carson.
We got Kun Phan, A.K.A. "Cambodian Carl."
Did 10 years in U.S.P. Florence
for hacking U.S. Missile Defense Agency.
What are you thinking?
I'm counting three, five, maybe more guys
who've all been processed into this facility
within the last three months.
Got a munitions expert, special forces.
I'm counting eight guys here--
Khalid Sankar, Yemeni medic;
Jonah Rodriguez, ex-marine;
and Cyrus Choy --
he's a Red Pole enforcer out of Taiwan.
He's got an entire team in place.
What the hell is he doing?
Go!
Let's go!
Sir?
Nest command to A.C.R., block "B" has been breached!
We need tactical reinforcement to the Nest!
Sir, we just lost video!
Camera two is down!
Got to turn you back!
We're in a full-facility lockdown!
We've had a breach!
Detainee has taken --
Easy!
Desmond to deck command,
prisoner for transport, come back.
That $50,000 is still on the table, Desmond.
It's yours for the taking.
All you got to do is help me to help you stay alive.
You sure about this?
Do it.
Eagle, eagle, this is major.
We have a breach alert. Please authenticate.
Eagle, eagle, this is major.
We have a breach alert. Please authenticate.
The eagle's dead.
Identify yourself.
I'm the man who just took over your gulag,
and you're a desk jockey that's gonna put me in touch
with somebody who matters -- clear?
Samar?
Ressler, I can't put any weight on my foot.
Horrible, isn't it -- this room --
this is where all the prisoners come to die.
After you break their minds.
They're led here like cattle for you to slaughter.
When they put down your rebellion, pal,
you're gonna take my place up here, I swear.
Get on your feet! Get your feet!
Get on your feet! Get on your feet!
Stay! Get on your feet!
Sir! Uh, sir, we have a situation.
Uh, we've lost contact with Agent Keen.
What about Ressler? Navabi?
Uh, nothing since after they touched down.
I reached out to Lanley. The entire facility is dark.
We've got Braxton.
The CIA's patching him through.
This is Agent Rosenberg. He's our hostage negotiator.
Tread lightly, Agent Rosenberg.
Those are my people inside there.
Understood, and they're gonna be fine.
We're gonna take our time, hear what he has to say,
and get everyone out alive. You ready?
Mr. Braxton, this is Agent Phillip Rosenberg.
The director of NCS has instructed me
to open a dialogue with you.
We're not having a dialogue.
I'm here to listen, but first,
I just need to talk to the warden.
I just need to make sure that he's okay
and can confirm the hostages are okay.
No, you are a water boy,
a bureaucrat with a stack of cue cards.
Just need to talk to the warden.
Of course you do -- protocol.
I have him right here.
This is Warden Mills.
Mr. Mills, everyone's okay?
Some casualties, but all accounted for.
That's terrific. Glad to hear your voice.
See that, Mr. Braxton?
I just wanted to talk to the warden.
Mr. Mills?
Warden?
Mr. Mills?
I'm done talking to you, Mr. Rosenberg.
I want to speak to somebody with real authority.
This is Harold Cooper, Assistant Director for the FBI.
Hello, Harold Cooper.
I'm pretty sure you see how this works.
I get what I need, or somebody dies.
From here on forward...
I am the warden.
What the hell are you doing here?
I came to help get you out.
You came out of curiosity.
Or maybe I actually care about what happens to you.
Your government is being robbed.
From here? How?
What's he after?
The Fulcrum.
I don't know what that is. The Fulcrum -- what is that?
It's a blackmail file -- proof of the existence
of an extraordinarily powerful clandestine organization.
If their activities were made public,
some of the most powerful and influential men
would go to prison or be executed.
And it's here, this Fulcrum?
No, the Fulcrum isn't here,
but I believe information critical to finding it is,
and that's what Braxton wants.
I'm here to stop it.
I can help you.
No, you need to leave.
Ressler and Samar have been taken hostage.
They shouldn't even be here.
You never should've come here.
Why didn't you come to us?
What aren't you telling me? Why don't you want me here?
I'll get to Ressler and Samar as soon as I can,
but you need to get back on that chopper.
Not without Ressler and Samar or you.
Now, how are we gonna stop Braxton?
He has an entire team.
Well, sadly, there isn't a prison on earth
where I don't know a few guys.
If Braxton wants to access the secrets they beat out of us,
he's gonna need to get into the server,
which is only accessible from the nest.
How about during a lockdown?
This facility's like a submarine.
It's compartmentalized.
It can only be shut down by sections.
The security protocols render the entire server room
completely inaccessible.
How the hell do you know that? I didn't know that.
Khan has broken out of seven prisons.
This will be eight.
This server room -- where is it?
Northwest quadrant, basement.
We can't get you inside, but the German --
he has an idea.
Who is she?
Who is this girl?
She's with me.
Your idea?
The boiler room.
It's located next to the server room.
If you could get there, you could reprogram it to overload.
The pressure would cause an explosion.
That would blow up the server room?
If you're lucky, you'll take out the server room.
If you're unlucky, the whole prison craters.
You said, "If you could get there."
Yes, the only way into the boiler room undetected
is through a single air duct...
That's less than 24 inches square.
Looks like I'm the tunnel rat.
All right.
Khan will guide you to the boiler room.
Gernert and I will be waiting for you to let us in,
then you'll reprogram the system.
Good.
What about me? What's my job?
You don't have a job.
You're here because of what your cartel did
to Felix Moralez and my people in Reynosa.
Okay. Shall we go to work?
Braxton, you need to see this.
典狱长办公室
I'm sorry. The warden can't get to the phone right now.
May I please take a message?
Nothing?
Not a "Hello, how are you?"
Say something, Luther.
Reddington.
That's me.
You're locked out, Red.
I have complete control over this hellhole.
I'm confident you've got a plan
for every imaginable scenario,
but it's the scenarios you can't imagine
that bite you in the ass, Luther,
like me, here.
Do you think this is something that snuck up on me?
After Belgrade?
Belgrade.
Boy, things got nasty in Belgrade, didn't they?
It's funny -- up until then, I was aimless,
just an ordinary thief, but after Belgrade,
I became known as the man who bested the great Ray Reddington.
You didn't best me, Luther.
You butchered and clawed your way into my pockets,
and innocent people died in the process.
You're such a snob, Red.
Always considered yourself above the fray
with your handmade suits and your fancy wine,
your private jets.
Do you even drive?
You got everybody convinced you're so hard, Red,
but I know better.
You're soft.
You're not getting the Fulcrum.
And how you gonna stop me, Red?
Bore me to death with Beethoven?
Put me to sleep quoting Nietzsche?
Come on.
We both know that in order to stop me,
you got to have balls.
You got to run the gauntlet.
And after Belgrade, well...
...that's just not gonna happen.
So, tell me -- how are you gonna stop me, Red?
A wise man can learn more from a foolish question
than a fool can learn from a wise answer.
Was that Nietzsche?
No.
Bruce lee.
This man has an abdominal wound.
He's going to die.
Let him down.
Damn it, let him down!
Okay, Harold, let's test your reflexes.
This entire facility has been put into lockdown
meaning that all existing codes that ran this prison
have been invalidated.
We're aware of that.
Good, then you must also be aware that one single code
has been generated by the mainframe --
A master code giving the C.I.A. and any rescue units all access.
I want it.
Understood.
I can get my people working on that right away.
Okay.
Your reflexes, Harold...
Shabby.
Mine, however...
Lightning quick.
You just cost an innocent woman her life,
which means we'll just have to go get ourselves another one.
Let me set the scene for you,
just like them old radio dramas
your granny used to listen to.
I'm standing in front of a tall, fit...
very attractive Persian girl by the name of...
Samar Navabi.
Maybe you're familiar with her.
Anyway, Miss navabi has a noose around her neck...
Her very long, lovely neck,
which is about to get a lot longer
unless you give me the code.
I'll give you 10 minutes.
We're gonna give the code, right?
Sir, I'm sorry, but you have to give the code.
It's a black site. Nobody will know we're negotiating.
I'm sorry, but...
we're gonna give the code!
I am not allowing that maniac to lynch one of my agents.
You can't give him the code.
You know the protocol.
The minute that the negotiator got here,
he gave me all the relevant details on the Factory,
including the master code.
Why wouldn't I give it to him?
Braxton doesn't want the code to break out of prison.
he wants it to break into our network.
What network?
The Factory isn't just a black site.
It's a level-six intelligence node.
It communicates directly with Langley,
the Pentagon, the White House sit room.
The intel being squeezed out of these targets,
our highest-level targets, is mission-critical.
We needed our interrogators and our operatives in the field
working together in real time, so we removed any latency
between the time we received a lead
and our ability to act on it.
You put an access point
to the country's most sensitive data in a prison...
with the country's most dangerous enemies?
Yes.
Which is why I am asking you -- do not release that code.
Sir, Braxton's back online.
Cooper.
The code.
If I give it to you, what assurance do I have
that no hostages will be harmed?
None.
The code.
You hear that sound, Harold?
That's the sound of Agent Navabi's neck being broken.
Please. Stop.
The code!
Dallas, Foxtrot, One, Charlie, Three, Seven, Two.
Now let --
Braxton?
Braxton, respond!
We're ready here.
Good. Get to the server room.
I'll radio you once the system's back online.
Where are we?
I have attacked this from every angle.
Once Braxton reboots the servers on his end,
he'll have full access to the intelligence network.
How do we lock him out?
We can't, not without flipping the switch
on the entire network,
and Braxton knows we won't do that.
What would that entail?
Our D.O.D. satellites shutting down...
A temporary loss of real-time field communications.
So, CENTCOM would go dark.
And assuming we could even get authorization to do that,
it would take hours to shut it down.
Hey, once you make that last turn,
it's gonna be about 10 more feet.
Gonna see a vent there going down.
Yeah, I think I see it. I'm here.
Follow that, and you're in.
Braxton, we're in.
Dallas, Foxtrot, One, Charlie, Three, Seven, Two.
You all right?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Have you ever heard of Bruno Ashmanskis?
The most skilled cat burglar
I've ever had the pleasure of working with.
Bruno mostly did jobs on commission,
but he always wanted to do something for himself,
something special, so he got it into his head
that he was gonna break into the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge
to steal an imperial vase
from the Qing Dynasty worth millions --
the single biggest trophy of his career.
What happened?
I never heard from him again.
I'd always assumed he'd succeeded,
that he was sipping some umbrella-clad cocktail
on a beach in Tahiti,
until five years later
during a remodel of the Fitzwilliam,
they removed a wall.
There was poor Bruno,
what was left of him, anyway...
stuck inside a heating duct, still clutching that vase.
I prefer to think of old Bruno on that beach in Tahiti.
We have a problem.
What?
Our asset is tracking the extent of the breach.
It appears that Braxton's team
has penetrated your country's network.
Do we have confirmation on what it is they're looking for?
Yes, we do. The Fulcrum.
So Reddington does not have it.
I never believed he did, actually,
and his efforts to stop Braxton only confirmed my suspicions.
What's our collateral exposure?
Honestly? None.
We are mirroring Braxton's search algorithms,
and if the Fulcrum comes into play, we will find it.
So, Mr. Braxton is a liability?
Oh, yes, and Mr. Reddington may no longer be a threat.
We haven't touched him
for fear that he'd use the Fulcrum as a...
well, to expose us, but he's bluffing.
You can't be sure of that.
Alan Fitch did not think so.
Whether he is or not, it's a moot point.
He needs to be eliminated.
This prison of yours, the Factory,
I understand the American public is unaware of its existence.
Perhaps they would not notice if it were to...
disappear.
How much longer?
We've had a setback.
Gernert is working on alternatives.
I'm telling you... there are no other options.
This model has redundant computerized safeguards.
If I attempt to over-pressurize the boiler tank,
those safeguards kick in automatically.
There's nothing you can do to override it?
It would have to be done manually.
That means someone standing here,
resetting those pressure-relief valves every 90 seconds,
while someone else mans the temperature controls
until this pressure cooker hits 700 PSI.,
and that is not gonna be me.
You're not going anywhere.
Yeah, I am.
Because whoever stays here to do this manually
is gonna be blown into a million pieces.
Or just one.
Wait. You shoot him, they'll hear.
They'll be here within 60 seconds, and then what?
We can do this, you and I.
After the pressure reaches 700,
how long do we have until it explodes?
Anywhere from 10 to 20 seconds,
but there's no way to know for sure.
You're better off walking away now.
Look, Red, you know that after Delhi,
I'd do anything for you, but the truth is,
you'd be lucky to get off this rig,
and whatever your plan is, I'm not a part of it.
I've helped you. I've done my piece.
Way I see it, we're even for Delhi.
We can do this.
If we don't stop this,
the death toll isn't going to be in the dozens,
it's gonna be in the thousands,
and the world is gonna look quite different...
with Braxton in control of all our servers.
Every operative, every analyst,
every case officer in his pocket.
And Mr. Cooper has given him the keys to our kingdom.
We have to make sure he never has the chance to use them.
We have federal agents on site.
Buy me more time.
Let me activate an extraction team.
No.
No, just order the strike.
Yes, sir.
I'll have planes in the air within the hour.
The target will be destroyed.
Sir, you got to see this.
I just got confirmation that two F-22s
were scrambled out of Wright-Patterson.
They seem to headed toward the Factory.
E.T.A. to target?
24 minutes.
Get Kat Goodson...now.
Braxton, accessing information now.
One.
Two.
Three.
650 PSI.
A few more, and the boiler blows.
So, when are you gonna tell me the truth?
What truth?
About why you came here --
the blackmail file, the Fulcrum.
I can't allow Braxton to get it.
Why? What difference does it make to you
if he gets it and exposes this...
Cabal?
The group believes I have it.
It's one of the reasons I'm still alive.
So, if Braxton gets it,
they'll know you don't have it,
and they'll kill you -- is that it?
What's the number?
680.
So that's what this is about -- this whole thing?
Protecting yourself?
It may be hard for you to imagine,
but I once had a relatively normal life --
bills to pay, playdates,
family, some friends, people to care about.
Lost all that.
Lost how?
In Mexico, there are these fish
that have colonized the freshwater caves
along Sierra del Abra.
They were lost.
They found themselves living in complete darkness.
But they didn't die.
Instead, they thrived.
They adapted.
They lost their pigmentation, their sight,
eventually even their eyes.
With survival, they became...hideous.
I've rarely thought about what I once...was.
But I wonder...
if a ray of light were to make it into the cave,
would I be able to see it?
Or feel it?
Would I...gravitate to its warmth?
And if I did, would I become...
...less hideous?
I didn't want you to come here, follow me here.
Because the truth is if I don't stop Braxton,
what he'll discover
is that he can't get the Fulcrum without you.
What does that mean, "without me"?
Get out of here!
What the hell is that?
We're offline.
Get down to the server room, see what's going on.
Red?
Reddington?!
Breathe!
Oh, my God.
Red, breathe.
Breathe, you son of a bitch!
Down here -- the boiler room!
Take her to Braxton.
Paper-dog, we are 10-zero minutes from primary target.
Requesting authorization to arm and engage.
You can't let this happen.
Don't put this on me. You gave up that code.
You have three federal agents
and at least 40 innocent hostages in that facility.
Inmates included, over a hundred lives will be lost.
I don't agree with this course of action,
but I understand it.
We're doing damage control
because you couldn't make the tough call.
We don't even know what Braxton's after.
What the hell is so important in that database
that someone wants to kill all those people
on the chance that he might get it?
If you think I'm just gonna roll with this, you're wrong.
What are you gonna do? Go to The Post? The Times?
This whole operation is deep black. It doesn't exist.
Every trace will be incinerated
the moment Reddington's a confirmed kill.
You know what happens to whistle-blowers --
kooks, paranoid freaks.
You'll be a keynote speaker
in their next woo-woo convention,
and your people will be just as dead.
Reddington, get up.
You got to get up! Red!
Where is she?
Where is she?
♬There's a reckoning a-coming♬
♬And it burns beyond the grave♬
♬Lead inside my belly♬
♬'cause my soul has lost its way♬
Who the hell are you?
♬Oh, lazarus♬
The server's gone.
She blew it up.
♬How did your debts get paid♬
Carl is dead and so are the others.
Get Beck and Wolcott on it.
You don't understand. The prisoners are loose.
And if they find out we have a chopper en route,
we're gonna have a real problem. We need to go now.
♬Why you so afraid♬
♬When the fires, when the fires have surrounded you♬
♬With the hounds of hell coming after you♬
Where's Reddington?
♬I've got blood♬
He's dead.
♬I've got blood on my name♬
♬When the fires, when the fires are consuming you♬
I count at least a dozen cells destroyed.
We've got inmates in the southeast quad.
You seem like a decent guy, Desmond.
You should do something else for a living.
I just told you the animals are loose.
You can't get to the nest without going through them.
They're gonna kill you out there! What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna get her back.
♬Not a spell gonna be broken with a potion or a priest♬
♬When you're cursed you're always hoping♬
I'm talking to you!
I'm gonna need that shotgun.
♬How did your debts get paid♬
♬Oh, Lazarus why you so afraid♬
♬When the fires, when the fires have surrounded you♬
It's over. The server's destroyed.
Sir, we got reports of gunfire in the north hall.
♬With the hounds of hell coming after you♬
Now I can't raise anyone on the comms.
♬I've got blood♬
Reddington.
♬I've got blood on my name♬
Head him off.
Get the chopper. Let Youself handle the hostages.
♬And your sacred stars won't be guiding you♬
♬I've got blood♬
♬I've got blo-o-o-o-od♬

♬And the whole wide world coming after you?♬

All this, Luther, and you don't even know
what the hell you're looking for.
I know what it's worth.
It's not what you think.
It's not a golden ticket. It's a target on your back.
I know all the stories, Red.
I know where it was 20 years ago,
and I know when it disappeared.
I know about the house, the fire, the girl.
Sir, I just got word.
The missiles have been launched.
Impact in 30 seconds.
No wonder you came for her.
She was there that night, wasn't she?
She's the one?
Shoot him.
Shoot him!
