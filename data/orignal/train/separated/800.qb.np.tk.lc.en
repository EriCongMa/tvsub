oh , man .
&quot; the bed got burned . &quot;
i thought it was a dream .
&quot; it was a not a dream . &quot;
i &apos;m a little scared to see
what &apos;s on the other side .
&quot; writing left @-@ handed is harb . &quot;
goodness . hi . sorry .
i was just changing in the closet ,
like superman .
are we still allowed to see each other naked ?
yes .

i think i &apos;m handling it well .
yeah , you are . you are .
you &apos;re ... you know , you &apos;re not drunk ,
you haven &apos;t left me 300 voicemails ...
and you &apos;re not crying while
watching that movie ghost .
well , it &apos;s dirty dancing .
doesn &apos;t swayze do a dirty dance with that clay ?
that &apos;s not dirty dancing .
it &apos;s ghost . it &apos;s a different movie .
which one takes place at camp ?
dirty dancing .
which one &apos;s whoopi in ?
stop asking me questions about them .
drop it .
so i saw this tv show about monkeys in india ,
and one of the monkeys , when it gets nervous
and it wants to play submissive , it goes like this :
and that lets all the other monkeys know
it doesn &apos;t want trouble .
that &apos;s cool .
they also give each other oral pleasure ,
and they masturbate .
so what do we do now , jess ?
well , normally , i would go home ,
but i already am home , so ...
... can &apos;t do that .
i know where you live .
and i live where you live .
should we tell the people we live with ?
yeah , let &apos;s do that .
* bad boys , bad boys *
* what you gonna do *
* what you gonna do when i come for you ? *
* bad boys , bad boys *
hey , you guys , we have , um ...
big news !
i just got into the police academy .
* police naw give me no break *
* not a solider mona give you no break ? *
you know it .
he knows it .
because you are a cop .
no , my uncle was on cops a bunch of times .
he got no residuals , though ; he &apos;s poor .
that really is big news !
big news .
what a happy , happy day ! huzzah !
and to celebrate , i &apos;m gonna have a banquet in my honor .
a banquet for yourself ? that seems tacky .
can anyone here think of any reason
why today should not be all about me ?
第三季 第二十一集
so i guess we &apos;re not telling anyone today .
nah , it doesn &apos;t seem like the right move .
yeah . so we have to pretend
to be a couple for one more day .
it &apos;s not that big of a deal .
it &apos;s gonna be easy .
yeah .
so we broke up . what &apos;s the difference ?
i @-@ i couldn &apos;t be more okay with it .
well , i couldn &apos;t be more okay , either .
great . me , too .
capital &quot; o , &quot; capital &quot; k , &quot;
capital &quot; a , &quot; capital &quot; y. &quot;
i &apos;m okay .
i &apos;m not okay , mom .
i &apos;m not okay .
i &apos;m not okay .
i &apos;m sorry to pull you
out of your dance class .
oh , the recital was today ?
i know we did the right thing , i just ... i feel like ...
really upset , and ...
nick seems totally okay
and i guess i just need someone to tell me it &apos;s gonna be fine .
it &apos;s not gonna be fine , jess .
i &apos;m never gonna be a grandmother !
what ? mom ...
stop crying .
you don &apos;t even have to love him , honey .
you just have to get that sperm cooking !
mom ...
i &apos;m sorry , honey , i just ...
you know , this is where i &apos;m at right now .
well , this was really comforting , mom .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m in the womb , sucking my thumb .
look , of course she doesn &apos;t know i &apos;m in pain , tran .
i &apos;m hiding it like you &apos;re supposed to .
but i &apos;m lying to my best friend .
you &apos;re also my best friend , don &apos;t ...
don &apos;t start that weird jazz train .
i don &apos;t know how i &apos;m gonna hold it all together .
i can &apos;t talk about it with anyone all day .
i feel like a pitaya , you know ,
and i &apos;m just gonna pop .
what does that mean :
&quot; the problem is the solution ? &quot;
oh , you mean just focus myself on winston ,
and i won &apos;t have time to think about jess .
that &apos;s really smart , but that &apos;s not exactly
&quot; the problem is the solution . &quot;
do you know what i mean ?
that &apos;s , like , a cool sentence , but ...
it &apos;s more just &quot; stay busy &quot; right ?
thanks , tran .
if i &apos;d met you in your prime , during the war ,
that would have been glorious !
but then we would &apos;ve been enemies
and tried to murder one another ,
unless we formed an alliance .
you and me forming an alliance
in an old @-@ school war ?
that &apos;s a fantasy .
or a novel .
you just gave me another idea .
winston ?
i &apos;ve been thinking about it ,
and a banquet is not big enough .
you &apos;re not retiring from some
insurance company .
so what do you really want ,
besides a pitaya ?
dream big .
dream big , he said .
okay . um ...
if i had my druthers--
you know , 100 % of my druthers--
i ...
i gotta go honey roast .
the hell is that ? and don &apos;t say it
like it &apos;s some thing we know !
it &apos;s a roast ,
except you say nice things about me .
honey roast .
huh .
you know ?
well , i can &apos;t wait to make that happen for you .
you serious ?
he thinks you &apos;re serious .
how do i do it ?
you just get everybody
to say a bunch of cute stuff about me .
you know , all the , like ,
funny stuff that makes me sweet , you know ?
done ! what else ?
what ? there &apos;s ... there &apos;s more ?
make me a prominent chair .
like a throne ?
come on .
a throne ?
who am i , ceelo ?
no , i just ...
this is me , i &apos;m still the same person .
stop touching me .
i &apos;m not gonna change .
i &apos;m still the same person .
stop touching me .
so make me a prominent chair .
then you shall have that , winston .
what else you want ?
i &apos;m thinking maybe
you should mc my roast .
okay , i will .
and can you do it dressed as furguson ?
i &apos;m not gonna do that .
thought it might be special .
nah , it &apos;s strange .
all right , i &apos;m gonna get started on that chair .
well .... the dress code for winston &apos;s banquet tonight is ...
is opt ... is optional .
why would he write &quot; optional &quot; there ?
that &apos;s gotta be a mistake , right ?
and they &apos;re gonna give him a gun ?
what are you doing back there ?
thought it was about time i graduated high school .
i &apos;m proud of you .
that &apos;s it ?
no snide comments ?
i &apos;ve got legions .
but i &apos;m gonna be supportive .
&quot; legions &quot; means &quot; a lot . &quot;
i know what &quot; legions &quot; means .
anyway , i probably won &apos;t even take the test .
i failed the last five practice exams .
so that seems like a bad sign .
of course you &apos;re failing .
you &apos;re studying here in a rowdy tavern .
chumbawamba &apos;s playing ,
it &apos;s not even &quot; tubthumping . &quot;
you &apos;re writing with what looks to be a golf pencil .
where are your flash cards ?
do you not have o @-@ one single flash card ?
there &apos;s maraschino goo everywhere !
you don &apos;t have a flash card ?
i &apos;m taking over . you need a tutor .
yes , i &apos;ll do it .
you realize i have a boyfriend , right ?
oh , the hunky australian boy ?
congratulations .
cece , this is about your education .
nothing more .
he &apos;s actually from perth , so ...
perth is in australia , cece .
we &apos;ll start with geography .
oh , cece , i really need ...
... to ask schmidt
if my outfit &apos;s working .
it is not .
i was in the middle of tutoring cece !
make it quick !
i know why you &apos;re upset , okay ?
i should &apos;ve asked you to tutor me .
but he just volunteered ,
and i figured you &apos;d be busy with nick .
well , i &apos;m not busy with nick anymore .
oh , no .
did you guys break up ?
jess , are you pregnant ?
i feel like i made it weird with the pregnancy thing , you guys .
did i make it weird with the pregnancy thing ?
&apos;cause i really feel like i did .
i feel like , in my heart , that that was a ...
that was the wrong to say ,
especially to two women who are sitting alone in a room together .
you know , i don &apos;t know where you guys are at with your lives
but you &apos;re certainly getting up to an age
where babies are on your mind ,
and @-@ and i didn &apos;t want to throw that into the mix .
i could see that you were emotional , jess ,
when you left , and i ,
and i don &apos;t want to make you more emotional
by bringing up pregnancy .
and , cece , you can probably barely spell &quot; pregnancy . &quot;
and i feel terrible .
are you frickin &apos; razzing me in there ?
did i just here a razz ?
damn it !
so you &apos;re really building winston &apos;s throne , huh ?
it &apos;s a prominent chair .
and it &apos;s not right ! it &apos;s not regal enough !
how long have you been doing this ?
it &apos;s for the honey roast .
i &apos;m trying to think of cute things to say about winston .
i got great stuff about his feet .
what are you saying , dude ? you sound insane .
if anything &apos;s cute about winston , it &apos;s his yawn .
he goes , like ...
can i use that ?
you &apos;re scaring me , man .
like , for real . like , i &apos;m scared for you .
don &apos;t do that voice &apos; cause it makes me confess things .
i &apos;m really scared for you .
i broke up with jess .
you broke ...
you broke up with jess ? !
i broke up with jess .
aw , man .
it &apos;s real .
or she broke up with me , i don &apos;t know ,
but we &apos;re broken up .
well , at least that explains all of that .
kind of .
i just feel like i &apos;m falling apart .
like , my brain feels like spaghetti .
and my future feels like a dark hole
that i can &apos;t stop falling down .
you can &apos;t show her this pain .
or she &apos;ll freak out and it &apos;ll be over , okay ?
i wish someone would &apos;ve told me that
when malia and i broke up .
malia , i &apos;m in pain and i want you to know !
i want to get this pain out of my body !
i haven &apos;t seen her since .
i still read her e @-@ mails , though .
every day .
every day .
every damn day .
every day .
you have to hide your feelings no matter what .
and i am . she thinks i &apos;m okay .
that &apos;s my game plan .
i &apos;m talking about pills , man .
schmidt &apos;s got some anxiety pills in his top drawer ,
you know ?
that &apos;s a great idea .
do it .
don &apos;t tell any of the roommates about the breakup .
thought i made it clear that i do not want to talk about this .
sure .
he just seemed so fine with it .
like he &apos;s happier
than me watching coach
watching winston yawn .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s just as sad as you are .
it &apos;s an act .
you need to go and talk to him
so he can tell you how he really feels .
i &apos;ll go with you , okay ?
thanks .
of course .
are you guys frenching ?
okay , say you &apos;re frenching and i &apos;ll stop knocking .
ignore him , okay ? just ignore him .
i remember , cece . no one knows we broke up .
not a word .
nope .
come here , you .
why are we doing this ?
this is , uh , how i , how i greet everyone now .
and then i , uh , do this .
then do that . oh .
and top it off with a little bit of that .
you feel me ?
this is how you greet everybody now ?
ah , come here , you .
uh , that wasn &apos;t an invitation .
nick , hi !
son of a bitch ! come here , you .
what are you doing , man ?
you take the pills ?
uh , i feel as if i &apos;m of cotton .
sorry for what &apos;s about to happen .
do you have a minute to maybe have a conversation
with your sweet , sweet girlfriend ?
i think the only way we &apos;re gonna get through this
is if we &apos;re really honest with each other
about how we &apos;re really feeling .
this morning i told you
i was okay , and ...
why are you winking at me ?
am i winking ?
yeah .
i think i &apos;m just a little nervous .
i &apos;m gonna put my sunglasses on so we can keep talking .
okay , okay .
&apos;cause i don &apos;t think i can stop this .
please continue with what you were saying .
um , i just , um ,
want you to tell me how you really feel .
great .
gre ... i &apos;m sorry , &quot; great &quot; ?
i feel great .

no .
i feel amazing .
&quot; amazing &quot; ?
yeah .

i just feel happier and amazing and lighter .
tonight &apos;s about winston .
you don &apos;t have to worry about me &apos; cause i &apos;m worried
about the honey roast .
i &apos;m sorry i forgot
that winston is the most important thing
that &apos;s going on today .
that &apos;s where i &apos;m putting all my energies .

mm . delightful .
to you , too , my friend .
that is super weird .
what is wrong with you ?
what are you scared of a couple practice tests ?
just something more important came up , that &apos;s all .
there should be nothing more important to you ,
cece , than your future .
because nothing is more important
to me than your future .
do you know how stupid it makes me feel
to care more about your future than you do ?
nick and jess broke up .

and she started wearing him as a backpack !
ooh ! i did not see that one coming ! oh , my !

i think it &apos;s time , i think it &apos;s time that this cat takes over .
i feel like we should make this a real roast .

i &apos;m kind of scared , but i &apos;m also kind of excited .
i think , actually , it &apos;s my turn to ...

nick calls birds &quot; wind mice . &quot;
think about it .
nick says &quot; yahtzee &quot; when he climaxes .
oh , boy .
he calls turtles &quot; shell beavers . &quot;
well , that &apos;s what they should be called .
they &apos;re green . beavers are brown .
we &apos;ve definitely had this argument
and we have agreed to not talk about it in front of others .
but you know the worst ,
worst , worst thing about nick ?
you don &apos;t have to say it . you just ...
he &apos;s okay .
he &apos;s okay .
and i am ...
not okay .
i &apos;m not okay .
what are you talking about ?
are you nuts ?
i &apos;m falling apart .

i am not okay .
i &apos;m terrible !
i know i &apos;m smiling right now , but i feel terrible .

i really thought we had a future .
me , too . yeah , saw the whole thing , the whole thing .
and now we don &apos;t . it &apos;s done , yeah .
we have nothing in common .

i also can &apos;t stop smiling because of the drugs ,
so my face feels crazy--
it feels like i had plastic surgery .

well , why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because we didn &apos;t want to ruin your day .
and i &apos;m so sorry we did . we &apos;re so proud of you
that you got into the police academy ,
but we &apos;re just , we &apos;re in a really bad zone .
yeah , a too bad zone .
so let &apos;s just come out and admit it .
we &apos;re in a terrible zone .
are you kidding me ?
something this big happens
and you guys still look out for me ?
i mean , that &apos;s ... thank you .
i really appreciate it , you guys ,
but i &apos;m here for whatever you need .

everybody ? oh .
it &apos;s two ladies . i &apos;m okay .
this feels good .
let &apos;s never tell anyone we did this .

or is that weird ?
guys , in light of what &apos;s been going on ,
i will be postponing the honey roast
until tomorrow night .
okay .

no way .
not doing this .
we could say everybody come back ,
then you guys all get to wear white .
hi , again .
i &apos;m watching dirty dancing .
i know . i &apos;ve heard all three screenings .
i just don &apos;t understand how penny got in trouble .
well , you know , it was a different time .
who wins in a fight--
swayze from dirty dancing
or swayze from roadhouse ?
i think , uh , to wong foo swayze would win .
jess , this is really hard .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
i don &apos;t know what to call you .
it &apos;s like a riddle .
i know !
i don &apos;t know where to change or where to sleep
or where to go to the bathroom .

but you know , the social component .
oh , no .
