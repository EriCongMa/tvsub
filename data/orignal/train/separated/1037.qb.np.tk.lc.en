morning , peter .
i see your quest for manhattan &apos;s best brew continues .
one &apos;s for you .
yankee tickets .
versus the red sox .
yeah , i got them from frankie whispers .
i &apos;m not gonna use them .
they &apos;re behind home plate .
oh ? i hear that &apos;s good .
you bought coffee , yankee tickets --
this is not your most subtle con .
con ? peter , i am hurt that you --
you &apos;re trying to get back on my good side .
is that a crime ?
no . but let &apos;s review what is .
mozzie steals your treasure , and do you report it ?
no . you plot to steal it .
we don &apos;t have to do this .
oh , but we do .
we discovered adler &apos;s u @-@ boat .
and while you were coming in here ,
looking me right in the eye ,
you were hiding the art under my nose .
but that &apos;s not the worst of it .
look , peter , i &apos;m sorry .
you should be .
i &apos;m sorry elizabeth was put in danger because of me .
how &apos;s she doing ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it here .
ok . all right .
do you really want to get back on my good side ?
yes .
then i suggest we dig into the mortenson real @-@ estate scam .
you &apos;re right . focus on work .
focus .
did hogwarts book a field trip ?
looks like it . jones , who &apos;s that ?
oh , uh , evan leary .
the kid was sitting in the lobby since 7 : 00 .
said he wouldn &apos;t leave until he spoke with a case agent .
he asked to see a case agent .
someone did his homework .
10 points for gryffindor . come on .
evan ?
hi . i &apos;m special agent peter burke .
agent burke . and agent ... ?
uh , neal ... caffrey .
i work here , but i &apos;m not an agent .
took the road less recommended .
nice tie .
manhattan prep ?
yeah .
how can we help you , evan ?
um , could we sit ? i brought visual aids .
visual aids . sure . let &apos;s go to my office .
i &apos;ve been going to manhattan prep since 9th grade .
my family &apos;s not rich like most of the kids ,
so i can &apos;t afford tuition .
and i discovered last week
that my financial aid is being pulled .
excellent presentation .
thank you .
if you turn to section 1 , you &apos;ll see why i &apos;m here .
you think someone &apos;s embezzling scholarship money
from the school &apos;s endowment .
that &apos;s right .
it &apos;s his thesis statement .
look , evan ,
losing your scholarship doesn &apos;t mean someone &apos;s stealing .
schools cut funding all the time .
of course . but if you look at the graph ,
it shows that the endowments stayed pretty even
while the financial aid has been dropping
over the past eight years .
where did you get these numbers ?
i work at the bursar &apos;s office , and i dug around .
look , this isn &apos;t just about me .
this is about a lot of kids .
evan , endowments cover operating costs , salaries .
these numbers aren &apos;t enough to prove embezzlement .
you haven &apos;t gotten to my conclusion yet .
it &apos;s the red tab .
oh , yes . i can see the red tab .
says the scholarships started disappearing
the year andy woods took over the endowment fund .
andy woods ?
yeah . um , his daughter goes to manhattan prep .
chloe . she -- she &apos;s ... very nice .
but i think mr. woods is a bad guy .
you got one conclusion right .
andy woods -- american financier
we &apos;ve long suspected of managing money for the juarez cartel .
those are some brutal guys to be in business with .
woods may have a corner office ,
but his methods are definitely from the street .
d.e.a. believes he launders the cash
through investment portfolios .
now , we &apos;ve never had enough to go after him ,
but this may be enough to give us an in .
neal ?
we have visual aids .
now , there are only five ,
so you &apos;ll have to share
until wesley gets back with more copies .
tabs -- nice . - couple of years ago ,
woods lost a landmark divorce settlement to mrs. woods
after she found out he had a mistress ,
but he made sure to retain custody of their daughter .
chloe -- 17 .
when she started at manhattan prep ,
woods was elected to the board of trustees
and put in charge of the endowment fund .
you think he &apos;s treating the endowment
like his own piggy bank .
exactly .
i &apos;ll approach the school as a wealthy parent
with a teenage son .
i &apos;ll need an alias .
alistair stone --
a wealthy hong kong banker relocating to new york
looking for a school for your son , alistair jr .
you like catamarans and cognac .
it &apos;s like you &apos;re an alias savant .
i do like catamarans ,
but let &apos;s go with peter instead of alistair .
linda &apos;s gonna be upset .
linda ?
your wife .
she affectionately calls you &quot; ali . &quot;
she &apos;ll get over it . i &apos;ll schedule a meeting .
let me . i &apos;ll be your amanuensis .
follow you around , write things down ,
make you look powerful .
my menu what ?
can &apos;t you just say &quot; assistant &quot; ?
not at manhattan prep .
i might have graduated if i had gone somewhere like this .
i &apos;m not surprised you like it here .
even the kindergartners wear ties .
you know , if my sentence gets commuted ,
i &apos;d consider going back to school .
maybe get a master &apos;s , study abroad , publish .
don &apos;t get ahead of yourself there , hemingway .
i haven &apos;t decided if i &apos;m gonna close the keller case .
i told you --
focus on work .
words to live by .
my school never had a falconry club .
guess peter jr. will be the falconer in the family .
where are you staying while you &apos;re in town , mr. stone ?
the company puts me up at the four seasons .
generous .
linda loves the spa .
ah . too bad she couldn &apos;t make it this trip .
all right , wait here .
just sit on the bench while i meet with woods .
oh . my 11 : 00 .
peter stone .
graham slater , headmaster here at manhattan prep .
want to welcome you before i introduce you to andy woods .
oh , you &apos;re the warm @-@ up act ?
come in .
you in trouble ?
a lot .
i might get expelled .
well , that &apos;s no good .
me and this other kid --
here &apos;s what you do .
make eye contact .
if they nod , you nod .
do what they do .
it makes them think you &apos;re listening .
then you look them in the eye
and tell them you &apos;re sorry .
don &apos;t look down , all right ?
that &apos;s a tell that you &apos;re lying .
sweet !
thanks .
you didn &apos;t hear that from me .
oh . excuse me . western poetry ?
&quot; i end not far from my going forth
by picking the faded blue &quot; -- frost .
excellent !
mr. cooper , you &apos;re in the wrong place .
at least you wore a jacket .
i think you got me mixed up --
if i had a song for every substitute
i had to track down in these halls ,
i &apos;d be aretha franklin .
uh , i need to call my supervisor --
bell &apos;s about to ring , mr. cooper . you &apos;ll be late .
what kind of an example would that set ?
don &apos;t know how you make teenagers care about reading .
you just have to be willing to focus on the work .
so , where &apos;s my class ?
thanks .
we have three grand masters for working with our chess team .
probably a better life skill than falconry .
andy .
meet peter stone .
mr. stone , meet andy woods .
pleased to meet you .
prescott &apos;s shaping up to be the next fischer .
that &apos;s what i love about this school --
they push the kids .
well , i will leave you two .
mr. stone , i hope to see peter jr. at manhattan prep .
thank you .
well , you know what they say --
play the man , not the board .
never played chess .
grew up in a rough neighborhood , public schools ,
worked for everything i have .
so did i. nothing wrong with that .
no . but , uh , nothing &apos;s better than a school with connections .
it &apos;ll set you up for life .
that &apos;s this place .
you have a son here ?
a dauger -- chloe . a junior .
keeps me on my toes .
yeah , always wondering what they &apos;re up to next .
oh , your son &apos;s a handful , too , huh ?
he &apos;s very intelligent but impulsive .
his moves tend to land him in trouble .
the bright ones always try to break the rules .
well , i want to give him the best shot at life .
i know it &apos;s gonna cost me .
come on .
adams , bring the car around while i give peter a tour .
send your son here . he &apos;ll fall in line .
he won &apos;t be able to pull anything at manhattan prep .
damn it , damn it , damn it , damn it , damn it !
is this mr. brooks &apos; english class ?
i slept through my damn alarm .
you must be mr. cooper .
and the trains were delayed .
do you have anything for a headache ?
no .
you got a little something on your shirt there .
yeah . they &apos;re gonna be watching this baby , not me .
that &apos;ll kill an hour .
actually , you could have slept in ,
&apos;cause there &apos;s been a mix @-@ up .
i &apos;m mr. brooks .
my vacation &apos;s not until next week .
i &apos;m sorry you came all this way for nothing .
it ain &apos;t no thing .
they call me -- they have to pay me , right ?
i &apos;ll make sure of it .
this day turned out all right .
hi . i &apos;m mr. cooper .
i &apos;ll be filling in for mr. brooks .
let &apos;s see .
all right . according to the lesson plan ,
today we &apos;ll be continuing with romantic poetry .
no poets in the class ?
scansion &apos;s like math .
marking the lines -- it kills the romance .
close your books .
forget about structure for a minute .
just listen .
she walks in beauty ,
like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies
and all that &apos;s best of dark and bright
meet in her aspect and her eyes ,
thus mellowed to that tender light
which heaven to gaudy day denies ,
one shade the more , one ray the less ,
had half impaired the nameless grace
that waves in every raven tress
or softly lightens o &apos;er her face .
you &apos;ve checked in to me .
you know what i do , what i earn ,
and if i decide to enroll my son ,
you &apos;re gonna hit me up for a donation .
might have been a little more nuanced , but , uh , yeah .
tuition doesn &apos;t cover all of this .
we ask parents and alumni to contribute .
where does the money go ?
it gets spread around ,
but the majority goes into our endowment fund .
i need specifics .
donors trust us to put the money where it &apos;ll be most useful .
i also invest a percentage .
we want our money to make money .
you had to have taken a hit lately .
everybody has , but we &apos;ve done better than most .
get me the numbers . i &apos;ll think about it .
long time since i &apos;ve been in shop class .
i love shop .
something satisfying about doing things with your hands .
pulled the car around .
where are you staying while you &apos;re in town ?
the four seasons . i have a suite .
i know .
i asked the hotel to put a bottle of champagne in your suite .
they told me you checked in ...
but they never saw you .
and there were no bags in the room .
i don &apos;t see how that &apos;s any of your business .
you lie -- maybe your son lies .
and that &apos;s not the kind of student we want here .
i &apos;d like an explanation .
i came here without my wife , okay ?
decided to spend the first night in town with a friend .
she lives in the west village .
if linda found out ,
she &apos;d make me pay .
happened with the first mrs. woods .
expensive mistake .
no .
thank you for the tour .
you can send those endowment documents to my hotel .
and if you &apos;re not there ...
i &apos;ll know why .
you need anything else , you let me know .
all right .
yes , jen . - the magic hand of chance -- keats .
very good .
chloe .
what &apos;s in a name ?
that which we call a rose , by any other name , would smell as sweet .
ah , the bard .
no one did it better than shakespeare .
i went to italy with my dad .
made him take me to verona .
&quot; romeo and juliet &quot; is my favorite .
tragic romance . i know it well .
lord byron was described as mad , bad , and dangerous to know .
but he sure had a way with words .
don &apos;t mind me .
i &apos;m just here to observe , try to learn something .
of course . have a seat .
lord byron wasn &apos;t the only poet to rebel against convention .
but some poets had to answer to someone , didn &apos;t they ?
like a patron who made their careers possible ?
we raise our hands in class .
yes .
what if said poet worked for a patron
and his poetry was perceived as insubordinate ?
well , most patrons respected the poet &apos;s process .
straying from the course was considered artistic license .
but was a wayward poet ever punished ,
say , by being locked in a garrote somewhere ?
i &apos;d have to do some research .
all right . i humbly give you leave to depart .
mr ... cooper ?
i &apos;ll need to talk to you after class .
i said sit on the bench ,
not re @-@ enact &quot; dead poets society . &quot;
you said focus on work .
i did . i did say that .
i found out woods &apos; daughter was in the class .
it seemed relevant to the case .
do you know how many parents would be up in arms
if they knew their teenager was being taught by a felon ?
oh , trust me .
it is better than being taught by the real mr. cooper .
while you were spouting byron ,
i was being intimidated by woods .
oh , he &apos;s more paranoid than i thought .
yeah , but my cover &apos;s safe .
look , i &apos;m gonna go back to the office
to break down those endowment numbers .
you -- you &apos;re done for the day .
go home .
oh , good .
that &apos;ll give me a chance to look over the syllabus .
tomorrow , we start on dickens .
someone has great expectations .
i should have known our daring rescue of elizabeth
wouldn &apos;t buy lasting goodwill with the suit .
it &apos;s peter . he can &apos;t be bought .
neal , you know what this means ?
yeah .
if he doesn &apos;t let keller &apos;s admission stand ,
it comes back at us .
like a department of justice boomerang .
right now , i can &apos;t see that far ahead .
all i can do is remind peter that i am an asset ,
not a liability , starting with this case .
a battle won cancels every other bad action ?
yeah .
let &apos;s have a look .
oh , manhattan prep .
someone stealing lunch money ?
well , kind of .
we &apos;re helping a scholarship student .
this evan &apos;s a concise thinker .
a flair for color .
a facility with numbers .
and a massive crush on the daughter
of the guy embezzling from the endowment .
oh , so the lowly commoner
is in love with the daughter of the evil king
who &apos;s trying to destroy his life ?
does he have a shot ?
he might , if she knew he was alive .
don &apos;t tell me .
you rode into the classroom on your white stallion .
chloe is a teenage girl obsessed with &quot; romeo and juliet . &quot;
she &apos;s in love with love .
so all we have to do is redirect her affection
toward a more deserving and appropriate target -- evan ?
yes .
peter &apos;s got a lead on the case .
i got to meet him at the office .
i &apos;m gonna finish this burgundy .
i have some thoughts on this .
i take it you &apos;ll be playing the part of the helpful friar
who brings the star @-@ crossed lovers together ?
sans vial of poison .
good .
i &apos;m developing a theory on how woods is embezzling .
investments are the only element he has complete control over .
yeah , overhead , salaries --
all the rest can be accounted for .
if woods is investing the way he says he is ,
the endowment should be higher .
maybe it is . woods manages the account .
the school only sees the numbers he gives them .
a fixed percentage of the endowment is scholarships .
if he &apos;s under @-@ reporting , that explains why they &apos;re down .
yeah . like evan &apos;s .
graham slater is the school &apos;s headmaster .
if woods is doing what we think he is ,
slater has to be complicit .
slater &apos;s obviously our way in .
which is why you &apos;re going back to manhattan prep tomorrow .
really ?
i &apos;m sending you back in for the good of the case ,
not rewarding you
because you took matters into your own hands .
i know .
from now on , i make the lesson plan .
if you &apos;re smart , you &apos;ll follow it .
i walk in the classroom ,
and the girls were all glassy @-@ eyed ,
like they saw that kid from those vampire movies .
you know , i bet you neal would be a good teacher .
which will validate him even more .
what do you mean ?
it &apos;s a pattern .
neal misbehaves , but because he &apos;s neal ,
he doesn &apos;t face the consequences ,
and he gets a gold star for it .
this is bigger than this case .
i have to go on record next week
about what happened with keller .
honey , if you don &apos;t want to talk about it , we don &apos;t have to .
i am safe and sound on this patio with you .
i am okay to talk about keller .
what &apos;s going on ?
only you and i
know that neal was involved with the art theft .
there &apos;s no trail that leads back to him .
and keller confessed to stealing it .
if i sign off on this case ,
the art goes back to where it belongs ,
keller serves life in prison ,
and i &apos;m a hero for taking him down .
but neal gets away with it .
yeah .
he had the treasure , and he didn &apos;t leave .
he gave it up for us .
i think that says a lot about his character .
he had the treasure .
that says a lot about his character .
if you ask me , the right man is behind bars .
you can drop me off at riverside .
you &apos;re embarrassed to be seen with me .
there you go .
peter , we &apos;re 10 blocks from the school .
i know , but your cover &apos;s safe .
better walk fast .
yes . yes , i will ,
because i am a bright @-@ eyed young substitute teacher
getting a jump on his day .
when i get there ,
i &apos;ll ask to see slater with questions about tuition
to get him out of his office .
which is when i go in and look for details about the endowment .
i &apos;ll be in my class by the time the first bell rings .
textbook behavior , neal . i mean it .
you couldn &apos;t help yourself .
nope .
peter , slater &apos;s leaving his office .
i &apos;m on my way in .
i &apos;ll intercept him and keep him away while you search .
he just hid an envelope in his jacket .
i &apos;m gonna tail him .
you don &apos;t have much time .
all right , he just put the envelope in a locker .
can you tell whose it is ?
no , not from here .
i could break in .
class is about to start .
the kids are all going for their lockers .
somebody picks up that textbook , we lose the envelope .
well , if we could clear out the hallway ...
i have an idea .
did you just ... ?
yeah , just get in the damn locker .
let &apos;s go . get a move on .
let &apos;s go . come on . to the quad .
okay , everybody .
okay . line up .
isn &apos;t pulling a fire alarm illegal ?
so send me to the principal &apos;s office .
peter , this is chloe woods &apos; locker .
he put the envelope in the back of her calculus book .
find out what &apos;s inside and meet me in the quad .
here . ooh , careful , papa smurf .
very funny . give me the phone .
this is a quarterly report for the school &apos;s finances .
slater &apos;s sending it to woods via chloe &apos;s books
so there &apos;s no electronic trail . it &apos;s smart .
it &apos;s dated next week .
this is what &apos;s going to the board .
yeah , woods gets an early look at it ...
so he can see how much money he can siphon from the endowment .
we need to get a look at woods &apos; personal accounts to prove it .
peter , peter .
hi , mr. cooper .
hello , chloe .
um , i was wondering if you ever did home tutoring .
we &apos;re about to start &quot; a tale of two cities , &quot;
and i would love it if--
oh , well , listen , i @-@ i &apos;m just here temporarily .
but i &apos;m sure we could work something out .
really ?
yes .
you could come over ?
as long as your dad &apos;s home .
yeah . um , tomorrow afternoon ?
okay .
you know what ? we should invite evan .
who ?
evan .
you know evan ?
evan , this is chloe . chloe , evan .
we &apos;re meeting at chloe &apos;s for a tutoring session tomorrow .
yeah . see you then .
see you then .
we &apos;re going to her place ?
evan , you &apos;re gonna be fine . trust me .
i &apos;ll see you in class .
we &apos;ll have to get a no @-@ knock warrant to search woods &apos; home .
it &apos;s a perfect opportunity
to get into his office and find those accounts .
yeah , good thing i &apos;ll have an honor @-@ roll student for backup .
yeah , i heard . why did you invite evan ?
because woods might be more inclined to leave us alone
if there &apos;s another kid there .
and because evan &apos;s in love with chloe .
which may help deflect her amorous designs on you .
one can hope .
i felt the same way about mrs. fitzgerald , my algebra teacher
thus your lifelong fascination with numbers .
and smart , leggy brunettes .
i looked over the endowment breakdown , mr. woods .
it &apos;s very solid .
i do have some final questions i &apos;d like to go over in person .
are you free tomorrow evening ?
unfortunately , i &apos;m stuck at home .
my daughter has a tutor coming over .
tell you what -- i could come to you .
my girlfriend &apos;s cooking me dinner .
i &apos;ll be in the doghouse
if i turn it into a business meeting .
unless you bring yours .
my ... girlfriend ?
i insist .
what &apos;s her name ?
it &apos;s danielle .
you &apos;re together ? right now ?
mr. stone ...
danielle ,
i &apos;ll see you at my place at 5 : 00 .
wonderful . we &apos;ll see you then .
so , what &apos;s this girlfriend business ?
what would junior say ?
cute .
let &apos;s just focus on the plan . jones .
this is woods &apos; apartment .
his office is on the second floor .
all right , i &apos;ll be going after his desktop .
that &apos;s right . you &apos;ll copy the hard drive with this portable cloner .
problem is , his office is wired
with a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art catic sensor .
yeah , well , the whole apartment is .
i mean , the guy is working with the juarez cartel
and running a scam on the side .
i &apos;d be paranoid , too .
we &apos;ll need to circumvent the main panel
to shut off the alarm .
or get woods to shut it off for us .
while you enter the office ,
i &apos;ll accidentally open that door .
yeah , if woods thinks you set off the alarm by mistake ,
he &apos;ll deactivate it .
we do this at 6 : 00 p.m. on the dot .
tardiness will get me more than a demerit on this one .
if we &apos;re off by a second , woods will know .
not bad for big brother .
you &apos;re admiring government tech ?
no , i @-@ i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m pitying it .
it &apos;s terribly unwieldy .
i &apos;ll try not to let it weigh me down .
will you get that ?
uh , neal -- code red .
evan , right on time for our pre @-@ tutoring session .
this is my associate .
uh , mr. magwitch .
yes .
uh , we &apos;re gonna be acting as your benefactors .
what exactly will you be giving me ?
well , neal is more of a romantic ,
and i &apos;m a machiavellian puppet master ,
so what we &apos;re gonna be giving you is ... game .
to get the girl .
you told him about chloe ?
this tutoring session is basically a first date .
you got to be prepared .
it &apos;s not a first date .
it &apos;s a tutoring session for &quot; a tale of two cities . &quot;
do you have any idea how many women i &apos;ve wooed
by using an apropos quote from victorian literature ?
really ? how many ?
now , why are you wearing a cardigan and a sweater ?
um , i don &apos;t know . i just --
i don &apos;t really know what to wear
when i &apos;m outside my school uniform .
that &apos;s all right . let &apos;s focus more on how you wear it , all right ?
uh , lose the cardigan / sweater combo .
and , for holden caulfield &apos;s sake ,
will you unbutton the shirt ?
yeah , just loosen it up .
you need an air of mystery about you , okay ?
smile like you got your own thing going on .
she &apos;ll wonder what it is .
yeah , and hair gel .
i &apos;ve heard great things .
i think our work here is done .
carpe diem , evan . carpe diem .
mr. woods , hi . i &apos;m mr. cooper .
and this is evan leary .
we &apos;re here for chloe &apos;s tutoring session .
you &apos;re the teacher ?
yeah .
my daughter didn &apos;t describe you as being so , uh ...
so bookish ?
so symmetrical .
don &apos;t know what to make of you .
let &apos;s talk house rules .
you &apos;ll stay in this room . no wandering .
you &apos;ve got one hour . understood ?
understood .
dad ? i think you can go now .
we &apos;re talking lesson plans .
hey , chloe .
hey .
sounds like my dinner guests have arrived .
i &apos;ll leave you to your studies .
that means no phone , chloe .
and you --
eyes on your books .
&quot; tale of two cities . &quot;
&quot; it was the best of times . &quot;
&quot; it was the worst of times . &quot;
i &apos;d like to make sure my donation is spent
on something useful ,
like scholarships rather than a new pool .
i can see to that .
danielle ...
how &apos;s the food ?
oh , it &apos;s yummy .
reminds me of a meal peter and i had in aspen .
oh , yeah .
thank you again .
such a pleasure to meet you , amber .
i love aspen ...
except for the snow .
oh , it &apos;s okay if this goes longer than an hour .
don &apos;t worry about my dad .
oh , i &apos;m not .
evan was just telling us something interesting
about &quot; book the second . &quot;
yeah , um ...
it was just about the british spies ,
basard and clay , and they &apos;re ...
two seconds . promise .
take your time .
hello ?
yeah , he &apos;s here . i know .
all right , i &apos;m gonna step out , all right ?
i need you to keep chloe occupied .
how am i supposed to do that ?
she &apos;s acting like i &apos;m invisible .
evan , it &apos;s time to take action . all right ?
oh , you two are fantastic hosts .
now , as for you ...
is that my door ?
call me &quot; linda . &quot;
can &apos;t do that here , linda .
back to business .
linda ?
as in your wife , linda .
over there , now .
i &apos;m sorry .
evan was just mentioning the recurring water imagery
in the novel .
evan , you want to expound on that ?
sure . um , it parallels the anger felt by the peasants ,
um , right before they storm the bastille .
i wish i was in paris .
where are you going ?
uh , restroom .
when i get back ,
i want more examples of water imagery from both of you .
so you &apos;ve been to paris ?
it was a mistake ! i &apos;m sorry !
i &apos;m tired of hearing &quot; sorry . &quot;
well , what can i say ? !
he &apos;s not moving .
he will .
say you &apos;ll leave her !
i can &apos;t , because of peter junior .
what about peter junior &apos;s baby brother ?
peter junior doesn &apos;t have a baby brother .
he &apos;s about to .
in six months .
i need some air .
don &apos;t you walk away from me .
not that door !
hang on .
my apologies for the scene .
and , uh , i thought i was gonna be the one
in the doghouse tonight .
oh , no .
mr. cooper ?
chloe .
why aren &apos;t you with evan ?
i got another call .
so ... did you get lost ?
yeah . yeah , i guess i took a wrong turn .
爸爸
she is .
i &apos;m telling ya .
and the whole -- chloe ?
you &apos;re the one who told us to rebel .
she &apos;s always doing this pocket @-@ dial thing .
i tell her her jeans are too tight .
if my dad found out you broke a house rule , he &apos;d be upset ,
but sometimes a study break can be fun .
chloe , i can tell you have a lot of , um ... passion .
you just need to find the right place to focus it .
i know you &apos;re smart enough to know that .
what the hell is going on here ? !
i want to know what you are doing in my private office
with my daughter !
dad ! don &apos;t be mad .
why don &apos;t we all just take a minute here ?
oh , this will be over in a minute .
you interested in my office ? !
you looking for something ? !
it &apos;s actually my fault , sir .
your fault ? !
yeah .
evan .
chloe said that you had an old map of paris in here ,
and i really wanted to see it .
map ?
yes . yes , we were discussing the revolution ,
and chloe mentioned a copper @-@ etched map in your office .
after hearing about it ,
i thought it might be an original hogenberg .
well , 16th century ,
bird &apos;s @-@ eye perspective ,
and there &apos;s the bastille .
enough .
i want you out of my house -- now .
all right .
chloe , go to your room .
bye , evan .
turns out an honor @-@ roll student isn &apos;t such bad backup after all .
no , a @-@ plus for both of you .
and jones already pulled several account numbers
from the drive that you copied .
sounds like another win for us .
for the bureau .
well , of which i am an integral member .
stop digging .
digging ?
you know my statement for the keller case is coming up .
i won &apos;t ask you to lie .
but i don &apos;t have to tell them everything .
is that it ?
peter , i &apos;ve got nothing to hide .
you sure about that ?
yes .
you can come out , mozzie !
you have no proof i &apos;m here !
there &apos;s a half a bottle of wine on the table
and a whiff of camembert in the air .
circumstantial !
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
see ya .
little sloppy .
until that file is wiped ,
i &apos;m keeping a safe distance
from the bureau &apos;s favorite brooks brother .
he hasn &apos;t made a decision .
there &apos;s still a chance this could swing in our favor .
well , we have a decision to make .
evan put himself on the map with chloe tonight .
he &apos;s got momentum .
oh , time for the grand romantic gesture .
i was thinking a classic -- flowers , fine chocolates .
or ... this .
evan &apos;s homework assignment ?
a perfect handwriting sample .
i can whip up a sonnet , and you could forge it .
mozzie , i know why i want to help this kid ,
but why do you ?
i want to see the little guy get the girl .
plus , i need a distraction .
you &apos;re worried about peter .
and you &apos;re not ?
let &apos;s go with the sonnet .
i &apos;ll get my quill .
hey , peter .
i &apos;m on my way to meet slater .
did you write the check ?
technically , the bureau did .
should be a nice tax write @-@ off for mr. stone .
yeah , he &apos;ll put the savings
towards his upcoming alimony payments .
good luck in there .
and that &apos;ll be the last thing you do at this school !
you okay ?
what &apos;d he say to you ?
he knew .
he said he knew about me getting the documents
from the bursar &apos;s office .
how ?
he looked into me after the tutoring session .
he knew i xeroxed the quarterlies
from my copy @-@ machine code .
look , he said he was gonna expel me .
i had to say something .
what &apos;d you tell him ?
that he couldn &apos;t scare me
because i had some very powerful friends
of my own looking into him .
go to my classroom , okay ? lay low . go .
diana , we need backup at the school right now .
peter &apos;s cover &apos;s blown .
mr. stone , we cannot thank you enough .
it &apos;s my way of giving back .
now , unfortunately , i have to get to the airport in an hour .
you &apos;re not going anywhere .
andy , what &apos;s going on ?
his timing isn &apos;t a coincidence .
all the questions about the endowment ,
the quarterly report coming up , that check -- it &apos;s a trap .
don &apos;t do anything stupid .
then walk .
you &apos;ll be happy to know i just did the equivalent
of the hoisting of the boom box .
peter &apos;s in trouble . i need your help .
i &apos;m on my way .
what are we doing here ?
i &apos;ve got questions .
hang on , moz .
and as you know , this is where i like to ask them .
who do you work for ?
and don &apos;t give me any of that hong kong banker crap !
you &apos;ve got all the answers .
why don &apos;t you tell me ?
did the juarez brothers send you ?
hey , he &apos;s with the cartel ?
you &apos;ve got it all wrong .
check my jacket pocket .
fbi .
fbi !
shut up , graham .
we can &apos;t cut up a fed .
yes , we can .
go on !
you &apos;re gonna talk , or you &apos;re gonna disappear !
listen , i &apos;m outnumbered three to one .
we need a distraction .
what kind of distraction ?
anything .
it &apos;s classroom 23b . hurry .
hey , chloe , i &apos;ve been looking for you .
mr. cooper , hey .
someone put this in my gym bag .
listen , we should talk .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry about my dad .
obviously , i &apos;m not welcome at your home ,
so i want to give you my number .
you do ?
so you can call me if you ever have questions
about schoolwork once i &apos;m gone .
okay .
thanks .
chloe ?
seemed like you and evan really hit it off the other day , huh ?
kind of .
he &apos;s in my classroom right now .
he wanted to finish up an essay , so i let him work there .
it &apos;s quiet , private .
think he &apos;d mind if i stopped by ?
no , not at all . be just the two of you .
thanks .
sure .
don &apos;t let him out of this room !
get out of my way !
all right , one down , two to go .
turns out i did have need for a vial .
potassium carbonate , sucrose , and just a hint of nitrogen .
they have nitrogen here .
oh , this really is an excellent school .
slater , if you work with me ,
i might be able to strike you some kind of deal .
it &apos;s too late for that .
well , that &apos;s a shame . he cuts a pretty good deal .
i would know .
don &apos;t move or i &apos;ll shoot .
nice birdhouse .
let &apos;s go talk to woods .
waiting for somebody ?
dad ?
what are you doing here ?
well , i , uh , wanted to , uh ... talk to evan .
your teacher told me i might find him here .
actually , i &apos;m not a teacher .
you ...
you already know that i &apos;m a federal agent .
but guess what .
i am , too .
you &apos;re under arrest for attempted murder and fraud .
danielle ?
it &apos;s diana .
and your girlfriend &apos;s cooking sucks .
chloe , call my lawyer .
he needs to know about this .
chloe , i need you to do this for me .
let &apos;s go .
are you listening ? !
what &apos;s going to happen to him ?
well , he &apos;ll have to go to prison .
uh , chloe , your life is about to change .
i &apos;m not gonna lie to you -- it won &apos;t be easy .
but don &apos;t run away from that .
this could be an opportunity .
a chance to start over ,
maybe live the life you really want .
i got that chance ,
and it &apos;s the best thing that ever happened to me .
really ?
yeah .
thanks , mister
wait . what &apos;s your real name ?
neal .
take care , chloe .
i just wanted to say i &apos;m really sorry for everything .
it &apos;s not your fault . it &apos;s my dad &apos;s .
well , if you ever need anyone to talk to ...
thanks .
and i really did like your poem .
we &apos;ve got early day tomorrow .
got to get a jump on the mortenson real @-@ estate scam .
nice tie .
oh . it was a ... thank @-@ you gift from evan .
i know i @-@ i complicated your life .
stop . don &apos;t say anything else .
can i say thank you ?
i told them the truth .
but you didn &apos;t tell them everything .
what you did on this case , how you carried yourself ...
makes me believe this partnership can work .
i know what this opportunity means .
trust me .
they &apos;re nice , but they &apos;re not what matter to me .
about the commutation --
oh , i &apos;ve already made enough big decisions for one day .
got it .
those tickets being the hardest .
pretty good seats .
