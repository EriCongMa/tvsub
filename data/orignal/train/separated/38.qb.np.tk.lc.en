in the matter of the people of illinois v. randall a. simmons ,
case number 10 @-@ c @-@ r @-@ 2085,
on the charge of first degree murder ,
we find the defendant ...
not guilty .
it &apos;s over . it &apos;s over .
you hear me ?
murderer !
you killed my daughter !
you ! you !
order !
order in this court !
dad .
son .
murderer !
bailiff , restrain that woman .
murderer !
you ! you !
i &apos;m warning you .
i can clear this court if order &apos;s not restored .
hey !
i want you to have that .
they were willing to take it .
eight years , second degree murder .
we agreed it was the right move .
tell that to her .
that was a tough one .
thought you had it .
you had the jury .
you had the judge .
he killed her , you know ?
we don &apos;t know anything .
it &apos;s not about trial .
it &apos;s about pretrial .
it &apos;s about excluding evidence .
even a case like randall simmons ?
especially a case like randall simmons .
we didn &apos;t win that in court .
i know it &apos;s not sexy ,
but we won that in pretrial motions .
no , it &apos;s sexy .
what &apos;s this for again ?
chicago law review .
my last question , mr. gardner , if you don &apos;t mind .
sure . shoot .
you don &apos;t really prefer boxers over briefs , do you ?
what ?
and this is about the ...
you don &apos;t really want to know about my legal strategy , do you ?
i do .
but first , are you proud of being
the city &apos;s 16th most eligible bachelor ?
well , i was lobbying for 12th , but it &apos;s all very political .
joe .
i sure didn &apos;t expect to see you here .
i &apos;m an independent conservative , remember ?
but let &apos;s give these republicans some credit .
oh , joe , there you are . sorry , i was on a call .
look who i found haunting your halls .
oh , hello .
hello .
are you ... ?
looking for derrick bond .
lou .
derrick . good to see you .
and you .
i liked your d.c. offices .
yes . yes , i think i like these a little bit more .
more , um , traditional .
oh , mr. trippi , nice to meet you .
good to meet you .
this is mr. bond .
bond &amp; associates .
we , uh , merged .
you &apos;re really representing lou dobbs ?
i , um ... am as surprised as you .
talk about strange bedfellows .
uh , so i &apos;m going to start streaming this live now ,
if that &apos;s okay , mr. florrick .
it is , freddy . go right ahead .
thank you for doing this , mr. florrick ,
and , uh , congratulations on your traction
against glenn childs-- it must feel good .
well , i love this city , freddy .
so what &apos;s your take on the state &apos;s attorney loss
yesterday against the wife killer randall simmons ?
a tragedy . that was winnable .
think simmons should have gotten a stiff sentence--
the stiffer the better ?
absolutely .
if the punishment fits the crime ,
the stiffer the better .
but , um , your wife was on the defense team .
now isn &apos;t that a dichotomy--
your wife fighting to get a wife killer out on the streets .
no , not at all .
as a matter of fact , i &apos;m very proud of my wife .
the job of a state &apos;s attorney is not to wish
that the defense goes easier on you , it &apos;s to fight harder .
fair enough .
now do you expect to have any sort of open debate ...
mr. gold ...
five minutes then pull him .
we have another dozen of these to do .
well , we caught something on college humor .
you should take a look .
i completely agree and so does peter florrick .
he &apos;ll be happy to have people like you helping his campaign .
well , that &apos;s very nice , ma &apos;am .
you should really come hear mr. florrick speak .
well , hello there .
oh , thank you , mrs. twohy .
yes , i &apos;m looking forward to it .
mr. gold , hello .
becca .
you &apos;re looking healthy .
i am healthy .
you cut your hair .
yes , it was getting long .
so you &apos;re a volunteer .
i am . i &apos;m just giving back .
inspiring .
youth today putting aside their video games .
oh , the obama generation .
no .
why , mr. gold , you ... you don &apos;t trust me ?
oddly enough , no .
hmm . i haven &apos;t tweeted .
you asked me not to , and i didn &apos;t tweet .
i threatened you not to tweet and you did tweet ,
about whether mr. michaels , your history teacher , was gay .
zach said you needed volunteers .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
zach told you ?
yes , your boss &apos;s son .
i &apos;m sorry , we &apos;re all full up .
but thank you ,
dear becca .
excuse me , mr. gold ...
thank her and get rid of her .
college humor-- it just went up an hour ago .
it &apos;s the call girl , amber .
on the bed , in the car out of state . he &apos;s the best candidate .
no one makes me self stimulate like peter florrick
oh , dear god .
people say you &apos;re down in the polls ,
but i say you &apos;re always good at coming from behind .
coming from behind
oh , dear god .
you &apos;re not afraid to hand out stiff sentences ,
and i think you agree , the stiffer the better .
stiffer is better . and let &apos;s not even get into ...
get the key !
is the other door unlocked ?
no . mr. gold , he &apos;s going to open it after the interview .
no ... it &apos;s a setup !
get him off the interview !
cut it ! shut down the computer !
they &apos;re setting up his words !
it &apos;s a setup .
stop it now .
okay , freddy , thank you .
what are you doing ? what is it ?
we just gave them tomorrow &apos;s news cycle .
where you at ?
oh ! yes !
done !
just like old times .
who wins ? me .
well ?
i still don &apos;t like it as much as racquetball .
why the call , cary ?
why ?
the old peace corps gang kept wanted to know what happened to you .
really ?
what is that , your novel ?
it &apos;s a murder case . randall simmons .
thought his wife was cheating on him ,
stabbed her 38 times with a bowie knife .
thought you &apos;d take a look at it .
why ?
i lost .
take off your shoe .
why ?
because i want you to take off your shoe .
it &apos;s on my foot .
so untie it .
yeah , just take a look at it .
they were willing to take eight years .
so you screwed up .
we thought we could get life .
you don &apos;t even have to go to trial .
you get a fast eight years .
we &apos;ve done all the heavy lifting .
clearly you haven &apos;t or the guy would be in prison .
we couldn &apos;t get the evidence in-- you can .
just take a look at it .
more questions ?
follow @-@ ups .
boxers or briefs ?
no .
just need to fact check .
you don &apos;t need to answer that .
you &apos;re right , i don &apos;t .
hello .
what happened ? what &apos;s the charge ?
murder .
whose ?
his wife &apos;s .
no , they can &apos;t .
double jeopardy--
he &apos;s been trialed , cleared .
three days , mr. gardner , that &apos;s all . three days free .
it &apos;s okay , randall , i can handle this .
mr. gardner , captain melinda gossett .
u.s. army judge advocate general &apos;s corps .
jag . what , are you kidding me ?
at the time of the murder ,
your client was a mobilized reservist
on title 10 orders .
as such , it isn &apos;t double jeopardy .
the crime falls concurrently under military jurisdiction .
specialist randall simmons ,
pursuant to article 118 of the uniform code ,
you &apos;re hereby apprehended to face charges for murder .
you &apos;re not afraid to hand out stiff sentences ,
and i think you agree , the stiffer the better .
it &apos;s got to be her . she &apos;s out to get me .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
childs is benefiting .
he &apos;s probably financing it .
just you and me by candlelight
you can caucus me all night
all night ...
absolutely .
has it gone viral ?
it &apos;s growing .
if she showed more skin , it would grow faster .
well , we &apos;re just going to have to take the high road .
and you &apos;re going to have to vet those reporters more closely .
yeah , my fault .
there is something else we can do .
pull the trigger .
if we go negative first ,
we &apos;re going to be seen as going negative first .
peter , he will kill you
with a million viral paper cuts just like this one .
let him kill me
because i &apos;m not going to give him an excuse to come after my family .
what do you think he &apos;s doing ?
these people are just looking for anything they can use
to make you look bad .
peter , they have trackers out there everywhere .
they could follow you around .
they could follow your family .
they could take anything you say out of context .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
something is .
what did you do ?
it was at grandma &apos;s meeting thing .
what was ?
this kid , with a cell phone camera .
there were two kids .
they were asking me questions .
like what ?
about dad .
and her , the hooker .
they taped it , but i haven &apos;t seen it anywhere .
what did you say ?
nothing .
i was defending dad .
they just kept on asking .
should we tell dad ?
maybe they &apos;re not going to use it .
or they &apos;re saving it .
eight years .
come on , you &apos;re shaking us down .
because of the moratorium , illinois currently has no death penalty ,
but the military does , and we &apos;re not afraid to use it .
if i were you , i &apos;d take the eight years .
we &apos;ll get back to you .
um , we &apos;ll-- we &apos;ll get back to you .
i &apos;m lieutenant terrence hicks ,
mr. simmons &apos; court @-@ appointed lawyer .
the thing i &apos;d like to point out is that ,
given the evidence , eight years is reasonable .
i think you should consider it .
lieutenant ,
a year ago , i came home to find my wife stabbed .
the wife i love .
i spent the last year trying to convince people that i didn &apos;t do it .
and when i finally did ,
when i finally slept at home again , i ...
i will not take a plea of eight years .
i did not do this .
i will not .
you &apos;re free to retain outside counsel if you wish .
i &apos;ll simply remain as standby .
please , help me . you got me off before .
the thing is , randall , we don &apos;t usually practice in military court .
i don &apos;t care . i trust you .
i thought we were closing down the simmons defense .
we were .
things changed .
we &apos;re not gonna make the same mistake as last year , are we ?
what was the mistake last year ?
taking cases on whim , not long @-@ term strategy .
not whim , passion .
and simmons brings us attention .
yeah , more broke clients .
but , look ,
i &apos;ll support you if you support me .
derrick represents lou dobbs .
oh , yeah , i saw that yesterday .
how did that go down with trippi ?
their publishers have projects in conflict .
we &apos;re going to have to drop one .
so can i count on you ?
for a vote ? sure .
that &apos;s why we did this ; two partner to one .
so send lou dobbs packing .
go follow your bliss .
you know , i should wear a uniform .
i think i &apos;d look good in one .
with tassels on the shoulder ...
like hms pinafore .
hello .
you okay ?
i &apos;m great .
mr. bond thought that i should help you out with simmons .
ah , that &apos;s okay . kalinda can help me .
she &apos;s a little busy ; murphy / gomes .
oh . well , are you familiar with the randall simmons murder ?
i am .
we &apos;re headed straight into court , so ...
you &apos;ll need the cid file .
yes .
i took the liberty .
you took the liberty .
how did you even know to take the liberty ?
i keep track of things .
okay .
can i draw your attention to one thing ?
draw away .
the army canvassed the crime scene at the time of the murder ,
but they backed off
when the state &apos;s attorney brought charges .
now this is the investigation from a year ago .
but these notes in the margins ,
these felt @-@ tip notes , they &apos;re recent .
how do you know ?
i know .
yes , but i need to know how you know
so i can act upon your knowledge .
this is a xerox of a xerox .
the original notations are faded .
the felt @-@ tip notes are faded a little less
because they were only copied once .
it &apos;s the same as the cover letter ,
which was dated three days ago .
and these notes , those were from three days ago ?
yes .
you recognize the handwriting ?
cary ? really ?
he &apos;s helping them vet their case ,
feeding them information .
behind enemy lines .
actually , i &apos;m afraid , in a court @-@ martial ,
the prosecutor sits next to the jury .
we &apos;re @-@ we &apos;re over ...
all rise !
sit .
not you .
what ?
she &apos;s doing another cleanse .
state your name , please .
william gardner , your honor , for the defendant .
i assume you &apos;re not currently in the military , mr. gardner .
no , your honor .
have you ever served in the armed forces ?
no , your honor , but ...
&quot; but , &quot; mr. gardner ?
but i have great respect for the armed forces , your honor .
you &apos;re familiar with the uniform code of military justice , mr. gardner ?
yes , your honor .
call the panel .
i want to help .
no , you don &apos;t .
i know things .
you want to help ?
stay in school , don &apos;t do drugs .
it &apos;s my mom , isn &apos;t it ?
she won &apos;t let me ?
it &apos;s your mom , it &apos;s your dad , it &apos;s me .
i do not need encyclopedia brown on my staff .
i know things .
you want to help ?
don &apos;t tell your girlfriend to volunteer .
my girlfriend ?
the blonde .
becca .
becca .
don &apos;t send her my way .
i didn &apos;t .
we broke up .
i &apos;ll talk to her .
no . she wanted me to talk to you so you would talk to her .
i appear to be off my game today .
let it rest .
and what do you mean by that , corporal ?
i &apos;m just saying , my sister was a victim of domestic violence .
so you &apos;re saying you can &apos;t be impartial towards a man
accused of violence against a woman ?
i guess it depends on the evidence .
your honor , we challenge this juror for cause
on the grounds of bias .
corporal barnard , if i order you to be unbiased , will you be ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
good . you &apos;re seated .
mr. gardner , captain gossett ,
pretrial motions in my chambers .
as you can see ,
they &apos;re clearly more prejudicial than probative , your honor .
denied .
excuse me ?
did the police take the photos ?
yes .
is that your client in them ?
yes , but ...
then they come in . the jury &apos;s smart enough
to separate the prejudicial from the probative .
what &apos;s next ?
the defendant made a statement to the police on the night in question .
your honor , mr. simmons was highly intoxicated .
people v. kearns ,
intoxication renders a police statement inherently unreliable .
kearns is an illinois state case . it doesn &apos;t apply here .
the statement comes in .
your honor , in light of these unexpected rulings ,
i have to request a continuance .
denied . i &apos;ve got nine active duty soldiers on that jury .
i will not allow you to waste their time .
now it &apos;s 1700 hours .
we &apos;ll take a short break for dinner ,
and begin testimony at 1800 hours sharp .
at 6 : 00 , your honor ?
yes , mr. gardner , at 6 : 00 .
welcome to military court .
and did the defendant make a statement to you at that time ?
yes , he did .
detective resia ,
please read this highlighted part of that statement .
detective : &quot; she was cheating on you ? &quot;
suspect : &quot; she was sleeping with somebody , i know she was . &quot;
detective : &quot; did you kill her ? &quot;
suspect : &quot; i ... i don &apos;t know . &quot;
thank you .
one more thing .
in the course of your investigation that night ,
did you search the suspect &apos;s car ?
objection , your honor .
counsel approach .
your honor , the police had no warrant to search the car .
they asked the defendant if they could search his property .
he said yes .
is his car not his property ?
it was parked two blocks away , your honor .
it &apos;s the reasonable man doctrine . judge , he assumed they meant his home .
strictly construed , his car is his property , mr. gardner .
overruled .
please answer the question , detective .
we did search his car , and we found a backpack ,
containing the defendant &apos;s passport , a wig ,
and also an envelope containing $ 2,000 in cash .
look , we got this excluded in state court ,
so we never had to ask this before :
why was that stuff in your car ?
if you were scared that you would be arrested for something you didn &apos;t do
we can work with that .
that &apos;s not it . it &apos;s ...
they were calling my unit up to afghanistan .
we were all getting deployed ,
so ...
i was gonna flee to canada .
i was going awol .
whatever you do , you can &apos;t tell that to a military jury .
then what do we do ?
so , i &apos;m free now .
you &apos;re ... ?
yesterday . you needed me ?
oh , that . actually , blake &apos;s handling it .
derrick said you were on murphy / gomes and i should use blake .
yeah .
good luck .
i know that we have to drop one of them .
it happens with every merger .
i would argue that we find new representation for mr. dobbs
and stick with the client who &apos;s been with us longest .
that &apos;s all .
i hate this . i know we all do ,
but both of our firms faced economic ruin independently ,
and in my opinion ...
we &apos;re busy in here .
just give us five minutes , please .
sorry .
here are the billable hours attached to mr. trippi &apos;s account .
and here ... are the hours attached to mr. dobbs .
i thought you said two votes to one .
that &apos;s why we did it this way .
and i thought you said we weren &apos;t going to follow cases on a whim .
this isn &apos;t a whim .
did you see the difference ?
joe has been with us longer .
and lou brings us more work .
derrick more work .
no , us more work .
there &apos;s no derrick anymore . there &apos;s no us .
this is a betrayal .
you said that you would support me .
i didn &apos;t see the facts .
now the facts are important to you ?
in court , you couldn &apos;t give a damn .
come on , diane . it &apos;s money .
it &apos;s about keeping our doors open .
my dad drove his business into the ground giving money to everyone he knew .
and i &apos;m not going to make the same mistake .
you know what you just did ?
you just lost your certain vote .
becca !
zach .
what are you doing ?
what am i doing ? what do you mean ?
i mean , i didn &apos;t ask you to volunteer for my dad &apos;s campaign .
i haven &apos;t even talked to you .
why won &apos;t you just let me say i &apos;m sorry ?
because you &apos;re not .
i am .
there &apos;s nothing else i can say .
i text you , you won &apos;t text me back .
i try to wait for you after school ...
you hurt my mom , my dad .
i stopped .
i said i &apos;d stop , and i stopped .
my parents are getting a divorce ,
and i just ...
that &apos;s funny ?
yeah , actually , it is .
you think it worked once ,
now it &apos;ll work again .
what &apos;ll work ?
i was trying to show you that i was sorry .
do you know how boring it is volunteering at a campaign ?
do you really think i &apos;d do it unless i really meant it ?
so you meant it . good @-@ bye .
i know glenn childs .
so what ?
no . i know glenn childs jr .
i don &apos;t understand .
the army did their own investigation of the scene .
they ran the prints from the house against military records ,
and they only came up with one match-- simmons ?
maybe that &apos;s all there were .
but he had told me that he had had lots
of people from his unit over to the house .
by rule , criminal investigation command
has to turn over every piece of evidence that &apos;s relevant .
everything that &apos;s relevant ?
well , who decides what &apos;s not relevant ?
they do .
so what do they do with the stuff that isn &apos;t relevant ?
i &apos;m entitled to see the file-- all of it .
yes , ma &apos;am , but i cannot release that file to you
without orders from major janick .
and so where &apos;s major janick ?
he &apos;s gone for the day .
he &apos;ll be back monday at 0800 .
but we are due back in court tomorrow ,
and if i have to get a court order ...
ma &apos;am , unless the major authorizes this ,
that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re going to have to do .
is there a problem , corporal ?
no , sir , lieutenant hicks .
at ease , then . and get the file .
yes , sir .
sorry , lieutenant hicks .
congratulations on your commendation .
are you going back , sir ?
back ? no , i &apos;ve been redeployed stateside .
i heard fallujah was pretty hairy .
as you were , corporal .
no . no work .
yeah , it &apos;s will .
hi . sorry to call so late .
uh , there &apos;s something you might use tomorrow .
can &apos;t you do this tomorrow ?
oh , will , i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i &apos;ll phone back .
no , no . that &apos;s okay .
what &apos;s up ?
um , well , this is what the cid deemed irrelevant .
i , uh ...
three pairs of fingerprints found at the crime scene .
we found matches for all of them in the military database .
three crime scene fingerprints that matched military personnel .
three new suspects ? good .
we &apos;ll work up subpoenas .
thanks , alicia .
see you tomorrow .
kalinda .
what do you know about derrick bond ?
what do i know ?
well , i did the due diligence .
everything i found , you have .
what about derrick bond and will ?
sorry ?
as far as i knew , there was no connection between them .
i was the connection to derrick .
you &apos;re suggesting there &apos;s a link that you don &apos;t know about .
i &apos;m suggesting i &apos;d like to be disabused of that notion .
then , i &apos;ll get to disabusing .
three sets of fingerprints , your honor--
his unit leader captain gerald gauthier ,
private luis suarez and corporal bradley vernik .
there were dozens of prints at the defendant &apos;s home ,
most of them unidentified .
but these were identified , your honor ,
and they weren &apos;t part of the discovery in state court
because the prints aren &apos;t in chicago pd &apos;s database--
only the military database-- so we &apos;ve never seen them before .
your honor , we &apos;ll stipulate these men spent time at his home .
corporal vernik has a military record , your honor--
an assault charge against an ex @-@ girlfriend .
no official complaint was ever pursued .
the complaint was withdrawn .
and you know this how , mr. gardner ?
it &apos;s in the military investigator &apos;s notes ,
your honor , which also refer to phone records
indicating repeated calls
between the defendant &apos;s home and corporal vernik &apos;s home .
your honor , if defense counsel is insinuating something ...
oh , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m doing more than that .
the prosecution &apos;s theory is that my client
killed his wife because she was sleeping with someone else .
i submit that someone else was corporal vernik ,
in which case he &apos;s a prime suspect
and we need to call him as a witness .
your honor , i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s impossible .
and why is that ?
corporal vernik was killed three months ago in the marjeh offensive .
well , then , in which case we ask to call the other two--
private suarez and captain gauthier .
they &apos;re also in afghanistan .
we can videoconference them .
we can videoconference them .
i &apos;m not calling soldiers away from active duty overseas .
not for a fishing expedition .
well , then , we ask for a continuance
until their testimony can be obtained .
denied .
i already told you , mr. gardner .
now , do you have anything else ?
i move that you recuse yourself from this trial immediately .
excuse me , mr. gardner ?
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s because you don &apos;t like civilian lawyers ,
or something psychological ...
mr. gardner ...
but i @-@ i &apos;m starting to see why all those guantanamo prosecutors resigned .
the system is rigged against the defendant .
uh , your honor , if i could just ...
you &apos;re in contempt , mr. gardner .
another word , i &apos;ll have you removed for the duration of the trial .
you &apos;ve already removed me for the duration of the trial .
that &apos;s it . bailiff , take mr. gardner to the icf .
your honor , the defense calls for a continuance .
i said no continuances .
yes , your honor , but that was before you removed our counsel of record .
uh , pursuant to the rule 866.2 of the military code ,
when the judge orders a change of counsel ,
the defense is entitled to a continuance .
there are two of you .
neither myself or lieutenant hicks are , um , listed
on a @-@ any pleadings , your honor .
um , the rule is very clear .
only listed counsel qualify .
hell of a way to get a continuance , mr. gardner .
you have 24 hours .
so hicks has a silver star ?
apparently , he single @-@ handedly fought a convoy of insurgents in fallujah .
saved 20 men .
i ... i don &apos;t know what to say about that .
well , don &apos;t say anything .
it embarrasses him .
oh , now he &apos;s just making me feel inadequate .
i spring for someone &apos;s valet parking ,
i brag about it for a week .
okay .
you are now officially counsel of record .
what ?
i just thought i was done visiting men in prison .
but i let my client go .
i know , but , uh , lou dobbs still fired us .
he apparently
doesn &apos;t believe the partners have his best interests at heart .
the partners ?
me , you mean ?
he left the door open .
i convinced him to hear from you or will that you &apos;re on board .
will is in the brig .
don &apos;t ask .
is tomorrow good for you ?
to convince lou dobbs that i have his best interests at heart ?
sure .
tell lou i &apos;ll be right over .
your suspect , corporal vernik , the one who died in afghanistan .
yeah ?
his death benefits are being paid to his girlfriend .
uh , daria joyce .
that &apos;s the address .
kalinda .
brad never cheated on me-- not once .
ms. joyce , we &apos;re very sorry for your loss .
but we have phone records showing
that corporal bradley vernik phoned the victim .
those calls were from me .
judith and i were friends .
until your client killed her .
but why would he do that if she wasn &apos;t cheating on him ?
i never said she wasn &apos;t sleeping with someone .
i said it wasn &apos;t brad .
ms. joyce , if you know something and could shed some light on this ...
why would i tell you ?
because , otherwise , corporal bradley vernik is the only name we have ,
and it &apos;s the name we &apos;ll use .
we &apos;ll say he cheated on you and he killed the girl .
those are lies .
then , tell us who judith had a relationship with .
she was trying to save her husband .
save him how ?
the c.o. of their unit-- gauthier--
he said he could pull some strings , keep randall off the deployment list .
but there was a price for it .
and judith believed him ?
she was so desperate to keep randall home ,
she &apos;d have believed anything .
ms. joyce , i need you to tell this to the court .
no . absolutely not .
well , we can subpoena you if we have to .
i &apos;ll lie .
and the army will let me .
you think they want their dirty laundry aired in public ?
i think a man is on trial for his life .
your client killed his wife , mrs. florrick .
he was jealous of her sleeping with another man .
and the sad thing is , she was just trying to keep him home .
let me .
how do you know him ?
glenn jr ?
drama camp .
he was a real jerk .
that &apos;s how i got these pictures .
so , what , you &apos;re hacking his account ?
no . he doesn &apos;t have one .
i &apos;m creating it .
there . meet glenn childs jr .
you can &apos;t do that .
i just did . what is he into ?
what are his , uh , personal interests ?
american idol ?
miley cyrus .
the jonas brothers .
we should have him say something about his dad . something bad .
we &apos;re not really doing this .
what do you mean ?
i mean , this is all just fun , right ?
we &apos;re not really doing this .
well , they really did this ...
so , everybody gets one of those .
oh , for the firm , yes .
we &apos;re trying to go paperless .
at jag , we &apos;re trying to go paper .
you like the military ?
there &apos;s no other life .
wait . look at this draft witness list .
cary &apos;s writing again .
he wrote &quot; no &quot; next to daria joyce &apos;s initials .
he knew not to call her to the stand
because he already interviewed her .
his testimony is hearsay .
daria will just refute it .
right .
ms. joyce , did the victim ever confide in you
that she was sleeping with someone other than her husband ?
no , she did not .
nothing further .
the defense calls cary agos .
objection , your honor .
mr. agos is not on the defense witness list .
rule 607 of the rules for court @-@ martial , your honor .
he doesn &apos;t have to be if i &apos;m calling him as an impeachment witness .
overruled .
mr. agos ... first of all , hello .
hello .
you persecuted mr. s ... excuse me--
prosecuted mr. simmons for the murder of his wife in state court ?
i did . you were there . you remember that ?
i do .
and when you couldn &apos;t convict him ,
you convinced captain melinda gossett to try him in military court .
objection .
sustained . mrs. florrick .
mr. agos ,
did you personally interview ms. joyce just prior to this trial commencing ?
i did .
and did she convey to you her suspicions
that the victim had been sleeping with someone other than her husband ?
ms. joyce told me that she believed
mrs. simmons had been sleeping with the defendant &apos;s commanding officer .
and that would be captain gauthier ?
that &apos;s right .
your honor , i have to object here on grounds of relevance .
overruled . please continue , mrs. florrick .
and did she believe there were reasons for this sexual activity ?
captain gauthier had told her
he could keep the defendant from being deployed , in exchange for sex .
your honor , based on mr. agos &apos;s testimony ,
we ask that we be allowed
to question captain gauthier overseas via teleconference .
objection .
overruled .
you swear you tell the truth ?
the whole truth and nothing but the truth ? so help you god .
i do .
so you were at the bar that night with specialist simmons ?
yes , ma &apos;am . i left at 2300 hours ,
and drove corporal vernik and private suarez back to the base .
and then , where did you go , captain ?
i went home .
so you didn &apos;t make a stop at the home of the defendant ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
because mrs. simmons threatened you , didn &apos;t she , captain ?
she was going to tell her husband that you &apos;d extorted sexual favors from her .
no .
you told her that you could keep her husband from being deployed .
no . i don &apos;t have that authority .
but she didn &apos;t know that , did she ?
and when you didn &apos;t make good on your promise ,
she threatened you , and you went to her home .
i ...
you went to her home , and you stabbed her 38 times .
captain gauthier , this is colonel leora kuhn , acting judge .
do you require counsel , captain ?
counsel ?
i want ...
captain gauthier ?
captain ?
so you &apos;re saying you can set aside your personal political convictions
when it comes to representing me and my interests ?
truthfully , i can never put aside my personal political convictions .
what i &apos;m saying is they won &apos;t be an issue .
if i can represent murderers when i think they &apos;re guilty ,
i can represent you .
well , that &apos;s damn decent of you .
a real vote of confidence .
why do i get the feeling that derrick bond put you up to this ?
well , he did ,
but i would have turned him down if i didn &apos;t believe it .
you come back with derrick as your lawyer ,
and we will not have a problem . you have my word on that .
i &apos;ll come back .
but i don &apos;t want derrick as my attorney .
i want you .
me ?
no .
you &apos;ve been more up @-@ front with me in the past 25 minutes
than any attorney i &apos;ve dealt with .
and i like the fact you won &apos;t betray your convictions .
think about it .
in the matter of the united states v. specialist randall simmons ,
on the charge of murder under section 118
of the uniform code of military justice ,
we the panel find the defendant ...
not guilty .
thank you .
dad , i &apos;m free .
hey , alicia .
congratulations .
he didn &apos;t do it , cary .
captain gauthier went awol .
there &apos;s your suspect .
you know , your client , now that he &apos;s been found not guilty ,
it frees him up to serve out his commitment .
his ...
his tour of duty .
they &apos;re deploying him to afghanistan .
yes ?
you wanted me to look into bond and will ,
see if there was any previous connection .
oh , yes . don &apos;t worry about it .
it &apos;s just the old boy &apos;s network reasserting itself , that &apos;s all .
