Hey,you guys.\nHey,what are you doing?
Figuring out our wedding plans.\n- Funny. We were doing the same thing.
It's really crazy.\nThe hall,the dress,the food.
I had no idea how expensive this was.\n- Yeah,it is really pricey.
I freaked when I heard the numbers.\n- So,what did you two do about it?
It was simple. I came up with\nsome cost-cutting solutions..
wrote out a list,\nand Monica told me to go to hell.
There's no way around it. Just accept\nthat this is gonna cost a lot of money.
I heard that weddings are,like,\na $40 billion-a-year industry.
Yeah. And I'm responsible\nfor just,like,half of that.
I don't know. It's a lot of money\nto spend on one day.
Hey,I've been married before,\nI don't need a big wedding.
All I ask is that you don't do ecstasy\nand make out with my brother.
But really,it does seem like\nthis money could be put to better use.
Hey,you could buy a ton\nof Amway products.
Or give it all to charity.\n- Oh,that's great.
How am I gonna unload\nall those Amway products?
Are you serious?
Yeah. How would you feel if we gave\nall the wedding money to charity..
and we just got married at City Hall?
I think it would make me\nwanna marry you even more.
I gotta say,you guys,\nthat's an incredible gesture.
Maybe you do that\nnext time you get married.
No,no,no. The next time's\ngonna be Hawaii at sunset.
But maybe the time after that.
The.One.With.The.Home.Study
Hey. What's going on?\n- Hey.
Our adoption social worker is coming,\nso we're cleaning the apartment.
"We"?
You know you don't want me to help.\nYou can't have it both ways.
Is this the person who decides\nwhether or not you get a baby?
She's coming to see where we live.\n- And it has to go perfectly.
If she doesn't like us,she can keep\nus off every adoption list in the state.
Hey,maybe I should stop by.\nShe could be a soap opera fan.
It's very impressive when\nthe little people know a celebrity.
"Little people"?
"Celebrity."
So I think I'm just about done here.
Unless you have any bad stuff hidden\nsomewhere,like porn or cigarettes?
What?
No.\n- Chandler.
I don't,and I'm offended\nby the insinuation.
So there's not a magazine\nunder the couch..
or cigarettes taped to the back\nof the toilet tank..
or a filthy video in the VCR?
I'll admit to the cigarettes and magazine.\nBut that tape is not mine.
It isn't mine.\n- I guess we'll never know whose it is.
May I help you?
Yes. We're here to make a rather\nsizable donation to the children.
Any contribution,large or small,\nis appreciated.
I think you're gonna appreciate\nthe crap out of this one.
Well,this is very generous.\n- And we don't want any recognition.
This is completely anonymous.
Completely anonymous.\nFrom two kind strangers.
Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
We can put your names\nin our newsletter.
Not necessary.\n- Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
And X is spelled "Mike Hannigan."
Possible headline:\nAttractive Couple Makes World Better.
Well,on behalf of the children,\nthank you both very much.
I'm glad we did this. It feels so good.\n- It does. It feels really good.
Oh,look. And we get these free T-shirts.
Actually,that's the shirt\nI wore to the gym.
It's moist.
Hi. Emma will be up in a minute.\n- Oh,good.
Hey,Ross,listen. I heard about\nyou and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
That's okay. I'm sure there are tons of\nother beautiful paleontologists out there.
Absolutely.\n- There was one. She's it.
All the rest look like\nthey should live under a bridge.
So,what are you gonna do today?
I was thinking of taking Emma\nto the playground.
Oh,my God. What?
Like I said,I was thinking of taking\nEmma to the Museum of Knives and Fire.
Okay,look,Ross. I do not want\nEmma going to the playground.
Because..?
All right,if you must know,\nI had a traumatic..
swing incident when I was little.
Seriously?\n- Yes. I was 4 years old.
And I was on the swing..
and then all of a sudden my hair\ngot tangled in the chain.
And to get me out,my mom had\nto cut a big chunk of my hair.
And it was uneven for weeks.
And you made it through that?
I wonder who's gonna play you\nin the movie.
Okay,fine,you can make fun of me.\nI do not want Emma going there.
And I was thinking Claire Danes.
Look,I'm sorry to hear\nabout your tragedy.
But the swings are perfectly safe.\nAnd besides,Emma loves them.
You should come,and you'll see.\n- Those things go,like,40 miles an hour.
And there's that moment\nwhen you're at the top..
when you just don't know\nif you're gonna return back to Earth.
Space is filled with orbiting children.
Look,please,just come on.
When you see the look on Emma's face,\nI swear,you won't regret it.
All right.\n- Good.
You don't wanna be a mom who passes\nher irrational fears to her children.
"Irrational," huh?
I'll remember that next time you freak\nout about a spider in your apartment.
That's the same. I'm sure there are 30\ndifferent species of poisonous swings.
Oh,my God.\nThe adoption lady is early.
Okay. Okay. Here we go.\nHere we go.
Stand up straight.
Big smile.
Hello. Is this the Creepy residence?
We're waiting for the adoption lady.\nBut I'm glad you're here.
I was cleaning this morning\nand I found this.
I don't know\nif you wanna use it,but..
Oh,this is so sweet of you.
But I won't be needing a veil.\nI actually won't be wearing a dress at all.
I told you,I am not coming\nto a naked wedding!
No. We're not having a big reception.
We took the wedding money\nand donated it to a children's charity.
That's crazy!
Generous.\n- Crazy generous.
I'm sorry. I can't imagine giving up\nmy one wedding day like that.
Well,we're different.\nI don't care about having a huge party.
This is really nice for you,but..
Oh,please. I put this on\nand I just look like..
Well,radiant.
All right,but who cares? I don't need\na pretty veil and a fancy dress.
That's right.\nYou're making a commitment.
You know,that's the same\nwhether you do it at the Plaza or..
Where you gonna do it?\n- City Hall.
Oh,that sounds nice.
I was just there for jury duty.\nThey've really spruced that place up.
Okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.\nI've made my decision.
What I really want\nis a great big wedding.
But you gave all the money to charity.\n- Well,I'll just ask for it back.
I don't think you can do that.\n- Why not?
This is her wedding day. That's way\nmore important than some stupid kids.
That's sweet,honey,but save\nsomething for the adoption lady.
All right,okay. Be careful.\n- Okay.
Careful. Watch her hair.\nWatch her hair!
Rach,she's got,like,three hairs.\n- I know. I know.
But they're just so beautiful.\nOh,my God,I just pulled one out.
I promise you she's safe.\nWatch how much she loves this.
Okay. Okay.\n- Are you ready,sweetie? Here we go.
Okay,careful. Okay.
She's smiling.
Look at that,she does like it.
See,I told you.
Oh,my God. Look at her,\nshe's a little daredevil.
Oh,God. Let me push. Can I push?\n- Oh,absolutely.
Oh,God. Okay,get the camera.\nIt's in the diaper bag.
Okay.
See? Scared of the swings.\nI bet you feel pretty silly.
We're asking for the money back?\n- It's for our wedding day.
Now,is this guy gay or straight?\nBecause one of us has to start flirting.
You here to make another\ndonation the same day?
I don't think that's ever\nhappened before.
Gay. Go.
Oh,my God,I love your shirt.
The donation we made earlier?\nWell,we want it back.
Excuse me?
Okay,that money was for a big wedding\nwe thought we didn't want.
But it turns out we do.
So you're asking us to refund\nyour donation to the children?
Yeah.
This feels really good.
I'm sorry. I am. But this wedding's\njust really important to me.
Hey,it's none of my business.\nBesides,this is probably a good thing.
We've really been spoiling the children,\nwhat with all the food and warm clothing.
That's not fair.\nA person's wedding is important.
And especially to me.
I didn't have a graduation party.\nAnd I didn't go to prom.
And I spent my sweet 16\nbeing chased around a tire yard..
by an escaped mental patient who,\nin his own words,wanted to:
"Kill me,or whatever."
So I deserve a real celebration.
And I'm not gonna let some sweaty\nlittle man make me feel badly about it.
She could've been talking about\neither one of us.
Okay. Here we go.
Good luck.
Tongue,really?
Hi,I'm Laura. I'm here\nfor your adoption interview.
Hi,I'm Monica.\nAnd this is Chandler.
Please come in.\n- Thank you.
Would you like something to drink?\n- Water would be fine.
We're so glad that you're here.
We're excited about\ngetting this process started.
Because we love kids.\nLove them to death.
Well,not actually to death.\nThat's just a figure of speech.
We love kids the appropriate amount..
as allowed by law.
Your place is just lovely.\n- Thank you.
Yes,this building does have\na wholesome,family feel to it.
I feel like I've been here before. Any\nother couples in the building adopting?
Is that that couple on the first floor?\nWe should get a baby before them.
That guy tried to sell me drugs.
But other than that,\nwholesome,wholesome building.
What?\n- I realized why I remember this place.
Really? What is it?\n- Oh,it's nothing.
I went on a date with a guy who lived\nin this building. It didn't end very well.
That wouldn't,by any chance,\nbe Joey Tribbiani?
Yes!\n- Of course it was.
We had a great night. In the morning,\nhe promised he'd call and he didn't.
Rat bastard!
So you're not friends with him?\n- Oh,God,no.
No,no,no.\n- No. Nope.
Well,I'm sorry I brought it up.
So are either one of you planning\non staying at home?
Hello? Anybody in there\norder a celebrity?
What was that?
That's just some crazy guy\nwho roams the halls here.
He's great with kids,though.
Ross. Oh,my God,are you okay?\n- Son of a bitch!
Oh,relax. I didn't say the F-word.
Ross,see,I told you!\nThose swings are evil!
That's the last time Emma is getting on\none of those things for her entire life.
No,no,no. Okay,it wasn't\nthe swing's fault. It was my fault.
And kind of that kid's fault.
Who is still laughing. Nice.
Come on. Can we just get out of here\nbefore somebody else gets hurt?
No. Wait. I have an idea.\nI want you to get on the swing..
and you'll see that there's\nnothing to be afraid of.
I know what this is all about.
You've always been jealous of my hair.
I just think you're an adult,okay?\nAnd you should get over your silly fears.
All right,fine. I'll do it.\n- Good.
If you hold a spider.\n- Where?! Where?!
If you hold a spider.
I know.
Guys,is everything okay?\nIt's me,Joey.
Adoption!
What's going on?
Oh,it's just like I said,that crazy..
Bert,roaming the halls.
Guys?\n- Keep on roaming,Bert!
We don't want any crazy today!
Is he all right out there by himself?
Oh,yeah. He has a caretaker.\nHis older brother..
Ernie.
Bert and Ernie?\n- You can't make this stuff up.
What's going on?\n- We'll talk later! Everything's fine!
Everything doesn't sound fine.
Bert and Ernie have a big yellow bird.
You never told me about that guy\nand your sweet 16.
I'm sorry about that.\n- Oh,it ended okay.
One of my friends shot him.
At least you'll get a proper wedding.\nYou really deserve that.
Yeah,I really do. You know,\nI had nothing growing up.
Just like the kids\nI took the money from.
No. No,no. I see where this is going.\nDon't make me go back there.
I'm sorry,but I want to regive the money\nto the children.
But we can't. I mean,\nyou called that guy a sweaty little man.
Unless you were talking about me.\nWe never really cleared that up.
Look,I can't have a wedding\nwith this money now. It's tainted.
Fine,we'll give the money back.
If that guy at the charity\ngives us a hard time..
my friend hasn't shot anyone\nin a really long time.
I must say this seems like a lovely\nenvironment to raise a child in.
You are welcome to look\nunder any of the furniture..
because,believe me,you won't find\nany porn or cigarettes under there.
Before we look around,let me make sure\nI have everything I need up to here.
Why don't I show you the baby's room.
What are you doing?\n- You wouldn't let me in.
I thought you were in trouble.\n- Well,we're not.
But you called me "Bert."
That's our code word for danger.
We don't have a code word.\n- We don't?
We really should.
From now on,"Bert"\nwill be our code word for danger.
So that was the baby's room.
What room should we see next?\n- Any room that isn't behind this couch.
Some people don't get him,\nbut I think he's really funny.
I did not care for that.
You have to leave.
You slept with our social worker\nand never called her back.
She is still pissed,\nso she can't see you.
Okay,okay.
What?\n- I forgot my bat.
Oh,my God.
And for the last time,\nwe do not want to be friends with you!
And we don't wanna buy your bat!
What are you doing here?
Bert. Bert. Bert. Bert.
Are you friends with him?\n- I can explain.
Joey?
All right. Okay.
You have got some nerve\ncoming back here.
I can't believe you never called me.\n- Excuse me?
You probably don't even remember\nmy name. It's Joey,by the way.
And don't bother telling me yours,\nbecause I totally remember it,lady.
I waited weeks for you to call me.
I gave you my number.\nYou never called me.
Don't try to turn this around on me.
I am not some kind of social work..
that you can just..
do.
I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.\n- Really? Think about it. Come on.
You're a beautiful woman.\nSmart,funny.
We had a really good time.
If I had your number,\nwhy wouldn't I call you?
I don't know.
Well,maybe I'm wrong. I'm sorry.
Hey,too late for apologies. Okay?\nYou broke my heart.
You know how many women\nI had to sleep with to get over you?
Joey,wait..\n- No!
I waited a long time!\nI can't wait anymore.
I'm sorry that you had to see that.\nI'm so embarrassed.
Oh,that's really okay.\n- Yeah. We totally understand.
Dating is hard.\n- Boy,you people are nice.
And I've got to say..
I think you're going to make\nexcellent parents.
Laura!
We're back.
Are you here to take more money?
Because I think what you're\nlooking for is an ATM.
No,no,we're here\nto give the money back.
Yeah. Because you know what?\nIt's all about the children.
Although it's also about the wedding.
All right,here. No. Oh,God.
If I haven't said so already,\nsir,congratulations.
Oh,wait. Wait.
What if we give half to the charity\nand we keep half?
Or,no,like,75 percent for us\nand 25 percent for.. Or,no,like,90-10.
Okay,you know what? Enough,all right?
I'm stepping in\nand putting my foot down.
As your future husband,\nI'm gonna make this decision for us.
What do you think we should do?
It's not your decision anymore.\n- What?
On behalf of the children of New York,\nI reject your money.
But we're giving you this.\n- And I'm giving it back to you.
Come on. Consider it a contribution.
Well,this is very generous.
Take the check. Have a great wedding\nand a wonderful life together.
Sounds good to me. We can save up,\ncome back in a few years..
and make an even bigger donation.
And when you do,ask for Brian.
Oh,is that you?\n- No.
Hello?
Oh,hi.
Oh,my God,really?\nI can't wait to tell Chandler.
Okay. Goodbye.
Wrong number?\n- That was Laura.
She gave us a great report and\nwe're officially on the waiting list.
That's great.\n- Now we just wait for a call..
and someone tells us\nthere's a baby waiting for us.
Hello?
Have you seen Joey's bat?
Okay. I got a spider.
There were two,\nI picked the bigger one.
Okay.\n- Okay.
This feels perfectly normal.
Okay,get on the swing.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
See?\n- All right. I can do this.
There you go. Good for you.
You know what?\nI'm getting used to this little guy.
