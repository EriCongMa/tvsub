i &apos;m telling you , being pregnant is no piece of cake . oh , cake !
no .

what smells so good ?
ls it the shampoo ? it &apos;s guava .

yes . yes . yes .
i can &apos;t believe it . the baby wants bologna . the baby wants meat . i can &apos;t eat meat .
wait !
maybe it &apos;s the pickle !
the one with the fake party
what are you writing ?
joshua &apos;s coming in tomorrow , and since i don &apos;t have the guts to ask him out ...
... i &apos;m gonna sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket .
&quot; joshua , give me a call sometime . guys like you ...
... never go out of style . &quot;
what did you throw away ?
hi , guys . -what have you guys been up to ?
we went to see a collection of victorian doorknobs at the cooper @-@ hewitt museum .
without me ?
my uncle dragged us there , but it turned out to be really interesting .
they were so ornate and beautiful . look at that .
i don &apos;t know how museums work in england , but here , you &apos;re not supposed to take stuff .
i got it from the gift shop .
they have really lax security there .
it &apos;s a joke .
anyone for more tea ?
no , just me then .
hey , ringo .
every time emily &apos;s around , you talk like her . would you please cut it out ?
i think you like it .
i think you can &apos;t resist me when i do it .
you want to eat me up like a cream &quot; pumpy . &quot;
what ?
all right , look , i don &apos;t know all the words .
right . i &apos;ve got to be off . i &apos;ll see you . bye @-@ bye , then .
bye @-@ bye , then .
you guys seem to be having a good time .
she is amazing , and she &apos;s so much fun .
and you know what ? when i &apos;m with her , i &apos;m fun !
i do things like run off to vermont ... and you guys saw the doorknob .
i even signed up for helicopter classes .
she &apos;s leaving in two days . i don &apos;t have to do it .
two days ? you must be bummed .
she &apos;s got to go back to london ,
but i &apos;ve been prepared for this from the start . we both knew we had two weeks together , and then that &apos;s it .
hey , that &apos;s what all my relationships are like .
yes , but in ross &apos; case , they both know in two weeks that &apos;s it .
pheebs ! -hello . hello .
no , i know . yeah .
so the baby is totally craving meat .
i tried tricking it , and i made it a soy burger , so that maybe it &apos;d think it was getting meat .
and i got nauseous .
maybe that &apos;s because soy burgers suck .
but i &apos;m no obstetrician ....
being pregnant is hard on your tummy .
at least you got that cool , pregnant @-@ lady glow .
that &apos;s sweat . you throw up all morning , you &apos;ll have that glow too .
okay.here &apos;s that trench coat that you wanted .
great .
it &apos;s comfortable .
you could really flash somebody in this .
no . they don &apos;t want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store .
why not ?
well , because ... we get a lot of
they ruin it for everybody.i know .
i wore that sweater on a date last night .
it was the first date since the divorce .
congratulations . so do you love her ?
she &apos;s nice , but it made me realize ... i &apos;m just not ready to be dating .
that &apos;s interesting .
what was that ?
just an anti @-@ theft device .
then what &apos;s this ?
you need that too , because a thief could just tear this up .
we have to have a party in five minutes , so everybody cancel your plans .
what &apos;s going on ?
we have to have a bon @-@ voyage party for emily .
but it &apos;s actually for joshua .
that sucks . nobody &apos;s ever thrown me a bon @-@ voyage @-@ emily party .
he said he &apos;s not ready to date .
so i had to invite him to a party if i wanted to see him outside of work .
and now i have created the perfect opportunity to seduce him .
as much as i &apos;d like to meet josh and warn him ...
... emily and i won &apos;t be here . she &apos;s gonna come by to say goodbye ...
... and then i &apos;ve got a special evening planned . sorry . no party .
hello ? -surprise !
surprise !
no one &apos;s thrown me a surprise party before .
well , it was all ross &apos; idea .
you &apos;re so sweet .
and i &apos;m so surprised .
you didn &apos;t know ?
why are you over here if joshua &apos;s over there ?
i &apos;m trying to play hard @-@ to @-@ get .

we should probably get going soon .
but the party &apos;s just getting started .
we have to be at the four seasons for drinks in 15 minutes .

what are you doing to me ?
i &apos;m trying to get emily out of here ,
and you keep talking to her ...... being all interesting and making her laugh .
i don &apos;t want you to be funny anymore .
rachel wants me to be funny , you don &apos;t want me to be funny .
from now on , i &apos;m gonna be funny sometimes , and not funny others .
you feel better now ? yeah , but at what cost ?
six more months , three meals a day.i am going to eat ,
like , you know , millions of cows .
mommy cows , daddy cows , baby cows
no . no , i will never eat baby cows . no veal !
oh , but veal .
what if i even things out for you , meat @-@ wise ?
what ?
i eat a lot of meat , right ?
but suppose , until the baby &apos;s born , i laid off it .
no extra animals would die . you &apos;d be eating my animals .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;d do that for me .
absolutely . i could be a vegetarian .
there &apos;s no meat in beer , right ?
we can still make dinner if we skip the appetizers and ask for our check right away .
we can &apos;t go now . rachel is going to put on a skit .
oh , my god ! have you lost your mind ?
i am finally thinking clearly .
my lucky dress wasn &apos;t working out too well for me .
