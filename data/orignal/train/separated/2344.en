For over a century, I have lived in secret.
Until now. I know the risk.
But I have to know her.
What are you?
I'm a vampire.
He told me about your ex, Katherine?
That she broke your heart.
It was a long time ago.
How do we look exactly alike?
I don't want you seeing Elena anymore.
If you don't remove her from your life,
I will kill everyone that she loves.
She wants us to fight.
She wants get between us.
She already has, Elena.
Katherine.
We're going to have so much fun together.
The Lockwoods are werewolves.
The werewolf gene runs in the Lockwood family.
Tried to kill a werewolf and failed.
Now I feel like I'm not living up to my best self.
Now you've made an enemy.
Tell me what triggers the curse!
You have to kill somebody!
Ok, Carlos. That's it for me.
Mason.
Hey, Jimmy, easy. Let's get you home.
Screw you.
I know about you and Marla.
What are you talking about?
You've had too much to drink. Let's--
Dude. What's up? It's me, Mason.
I'm not messing with Marla. You know that.
You don't want to do this, buddy.
I'm gonna kill you.
Jimmy?
Jim.
Wait, the guy died?
You killed him?
He kept coming at me.
He got it in his head
that I was sleeping with his girlfriend.
Well, were you?
No. No.
I wouldn't do that. He was my friend.
He was drunk and attacked me. It was self defense.
And it triggered the curse.
On every full moon, I have no control.
If I don't sedate myself and chain myself down,
I'll kill anything in my path.
You have to be careful.
All it takes is an accident, a car wreck.
Any death at your hands,
and you'll have a lifetime of this.
You don't want it, Tyler. Trust me.
All right. Where's the moonstone?
Deal's a deal.
I answered your questions.
Yeah, I'm not sure, but I'm guessing it's in here.
My dad, he was very kooky about his hiding spots.
But I've figured most of them out over the years.
It's all yours.
You going to tell me what's so important about this rock or what?
I told you, it's just something I want.
Sentimental value.
Yeah, I'm not really buying that.
Why do you really want it?
Do you know where it is or not?
No, I figured it'd be in here, man.
I can't believe Tyler Lockwood's a werewolf.
We're not sure about that yet.
The only thing we know for sure is that Mason Lockwood is.
It should be easy enough for us to figure out.
There is no us.
I said that I wouldn't keep things from you anymore.
That doesn't mean that I want you involved in it.
By definition of being in this family,
I'm involved.
This is dangerous, Jeremy.
You have to stay out of it, ok?
All right. Just saying.
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Right. Right.
You ready for today?
No.
I hate fighting with you, even if it's fake.
I know. But if Katherine thinks that we're fighting,
then she'll think she's winning.
And that keeps her from following through on her threats.
Yeah, but that doesn't make it any easier.
Neither does knowing that Caroline will be there
reporting everything back to her.
Hey. Everything's gonna be OK.
Yes, we have to keep up this ruse for a little while,
but it's the best way to keep Katherine from hurting anybody.
From hurting you.
Just promise me that she won't get her way with us.
We can fake a fight,
We can pretend that her threats are tearing us apart.
But none of it's real. Ok?
Ok. How about this?
Today when we're fighting, if I say,
"I can't do this anymore, Elena,"
What I'll really mean is that I love you.
And when I say, "Fine, Stefan, whatever,"
It really means "I love you, too."
Deal.
Are you off today?
The historical society volunteer picnic is today.
You're the one who signed me up.
I know. I just assumed you'd bail.
Nope. I'm going to spend the whole day with my daughter.
You're going to pretend to be a mother?
I'll bring my gun if it gets rough.
Come on. Give me one day.
I've been buried in work mode. I've barely seen you.
Well, be warned. I'm in a mood.
Goodie for me.
What was Elena doing here so late last night?
Elena wasn't--
Yes. Um...
Elena was here.
Uh, she just needed to talk.
Her and stefan are going through a rough patch.
Is everything ok with you?
I'm fine.
It's just lately, you seem different.
I'm not different. I'm fine.
I know you think I don't notice these things,
but I do.
What's going on with you?
You know, there's pretending to be mother,
And then, there's reality.
Let's not push our luck, ok?
This is all part of the historical society's
Continuing efforts to give back to the community.
Thanks to the generous donation of the Fell family,
We are now standing on the site of our newest public park.
Thank you to everyone who has shown up today to lend a helping hand.
Thanks.
Stefan, right?
The other Salvatore.
The nice one.
The one offering an apology.
Not interested.
Look, my brother acted impulsively.
You think?
If you and Damon keep at each other's throats,
Somebody innocent is going to get hurt, and I don't want that.
And you have family here,
So I can't imagine you'd want that, either.
So what do you say we just quit the whole alpha male fighting thing
And just call it a truce.
I made that same offer to your brother.
He turned it down with a knife.
He made a mistake.
I'm here to make sure that neither one of you make another one.
Tell your brother to watch his back.
Well, I'm guessing that he only has to
worry about that during a full moon.
Otherwise, you're not as strong. Am I right?
Or you would have killed Damon by now.
There's one of you.
There's 2 of us.
I think you're the one who needs to watch his back.
If he comes at me...
He won't.
What are you doing?
Negotiating peace on your behalf.
I don't want peace.
Oh. Consider it opposite day.
Stefan.
Please tell me you don't seriously think
A handshake just solved our problem.
No, actually,
I think that the first chance Mason Lockwood gets,
He's going to drive a stake through your heart,
And then, through mine--
All because you took it upon yourself to try to kill him.
So thank you, cause we don't have enough problems.
When did Jeremy Gilbert get so cute?
Oh, no.
Stay away. That guy's damaged goods.
Hey, man, how have you been?
Since when?
I don't know.
I haven't seen you much since your father's funeral.
I just figured that maybe you would want--
I'm fine, Gilbert.
Yeah. Ok.
Wait. Hold up.
I'm sorry.
Bad day. Bad month.
Listen, you were cool that day, at the funeral.
Thanks for that.
Felt like kind of a freak show.
Yeah, well, I know the feeling well.
What are you doing here?
Distracting myself.
Hey, thanks for the text.
Where to?
My place.
My mom's gone all day.
Empty house, fully stocked bar.
Margaritas?
Sure.
You in?
Yeah. Yeah. I'm in.
Let's do it.
Oh, thanks, Mason.
Hey, Sheriff, you got a second?
I'm out of uniform. Let's go with Liz.
All right, Liz.
I was hoping to talk to you about the council.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I know you and the other founding families
have a secret council.
If that were true, then you know it's a secret
and isn't discussed with non-council members.
I know I rejected all that, but it's only because
I wanted a life outside of this town,
not because I was a non-believer.
Look, I know vampires exist,
And you have 2 of them living right under your nose.
Really?
Yeah.
And who would they be?
Damon and Stefan Salvatore.
That's impossible.
I know Damon Salvatore.
Do you know what he's done for this town?
I know it's a lot to digest.
No, no, no. I have watched him kill vampires.
He's an ally. He's part of the council.
Think about it.
When did the vampire attacks begin?
When Damon and Stefan Salvatore moved to town?
They walk in the sun, Mason.
They've evolved. It's not 1864.
They've figured it out, Liz.
No.
Damon Salvatore is my friend.
What if I can prove it to you?
So, suddenly,
she's in the running for mother of the year,
just when I'm trying to avoid her the most.
I'm babbling.
You don't want to hear all this.
Oh, um. No. I'm sorry.
Then what happened?
Well, I was a bitch,
which is par for the course with us.
So, how are things with you and Stefan?
Anything?
No, not since the fight.
He's been pushing me away because he thinks that
Katherine might get jealous enough to hurt me.
I just don't know how to change his mind.
You said that Katherine's dangerous.
Maybe he's got a point.
Yeah, I know that she's dangerous,
And I know that he's just trying to protect me.
But it feels like giving up.
And I--I just...
Just what?
I just thought that we were stronger than that.
志愿者日
Hey, I saw you with Mason earlier. What was that about?
Oh, I was just asking him to help with the clean-up in the woods.
That's what I'm here for. Put me to work.
Should I go help him?
Oh, no, no. You know what? He's--
I'm sure he's fine.
Are you ok, Liz?
You seem really upset.
It's Caroline. We had a moment.
Anything I can do?
No, Damon, thank you.
It's just horrible parenting skills paying off in spades.
Longing looks are being exchanged.
I'm gonna go talk to him.
No, Elena. I think it's a bad idea.
I--
What's her problem?
Don't worry about it.
Why are you being such a bitch to your mom?
Don't worry about it.
Do you still care about katherine?
Don't do this. Please, don't turn this into something it's not.
So this isn't up for discussion.
Is that what you're saying?
No, I'm saying that this isn't up for discussion right now
Because we have ears on us.
Ok. When?
I don't know.
I saw her, Stefan.
It's like we're the same person.
How could you hate her and be in love with me?
You're reaching. I'm not-- I'm not Damon.
How about we don't bring Damon into this right now?
You know, I can't...
I can't do this anymore, Elena.
Fine, Stefan. Whatever.
Relationships are about communication.
Hey, where's mine?
Have at it.
Thanks for having us over.
I think Sarah's got a thing for Jeremy.
Well, good for Sarah.
I'm really embarrassed about slutting it up with you
that day at the swimming hole.
I'm really not like that, I promise you.
No need to apologize.
Friends?
Yeah. Sure.
Can I see?
Uh, no. No. No way.
I want to see.
Yeah, let's see.
What's Van Gogh got going on?
Ok. Yeah. Check it out.
Ooh. Scary demon-wolf-thing.
What's this about?
Just some sketches. You still draw, Tyler?
A little. Not much.
You know, I've got something that I'm actually working on.
Come on. I'll show you.
Yeah. Ok. Sure.
I mean, it's nothing special.
You need a drink?
It's pretty much amateur hour over here.
I've seen your stuff before. It's great.
It's on the desk.
I don't really see it anywhere.
What are those pictures about, huh?
I can't-- I can't breathe!
Answer me. Why?
Why wolf pictures?
Because...
Because I know.
You know what?
You know what, Jeremy?
I know what you are.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hello, Mason.
Working hard?
Doing my part.
I heard you talked to Stefan.
Nice guy.
Yeah. A lot nicer than me.
Well, nice is overrated.
That's what I thought. Heh.
You have a good day, Damon.
Please tell me that you were just bonding.
So what's up with this, um, faux drama in your relationship?
What are you talking about?
Oh, come on, Stefan.
You and Elena don't fight,
Especially not over me.
Drop it, Damon.
With pleasure.
Would you like some lemonade?
Thank you, sweetie.
what's wrong with you?
Vervain. Vervain.
You ok?
No.
You know, maybe it's for the best.
It's not for the best, Caroline.
None of this is for the best.
I'm sorry, ok?
I...
I don't mean to take it out on you.
You're just being a good friend.
No, I'm not.
I'm not being a good friend at all.
Is she leaving?
Where's my mom going?
Look, I can't talk here. Just get Jess
And meet me down the hill at the entrance,
And bring the-- yes, we need it.
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing. I, uh-- I just have something--
You mean work? I mean, you surprised me.
You lasted longer than 5 minutes.
It's important.
It always is.
I'm sorry.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Something's up.
I've had worse.
I'm gonna kill him.
No, no. Hey.
Listen to me. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit!
I'm not listening to any more of your give peace a chance crap.
He's dead.
Ok.
I don't like it, but he's making threats.
He could expose us. We need to put him down.
All right. Let's do it.
Woods. Trash duty. Come on.
Where are you going? What's going on?
I need to be able to hear better.
Hear what?
Something's wrong, Elena.
Caroline-- shh.
Don't look so surprised.
You knew this was inevitable.
Go ahead. Run.
I'll give you a head start.
Oh, god.
What is it?
Stefan and Damon.
What?
Thank you, Mason.
How do you know about all this?
My uncle John left this old diary lying around.
It was written by a crazy Gilbert ancestor
Who wrote about this curse that ran in your family.
A curse about what?
Werewolves.
It's crazy, right?
But then, Matt was attacked
By a wolf under a full moon,
And your uncle had just gotten back to town.
It was just-- it was too weird.
Is it true?
About my uncle?
Yeah.
But you-- you're not?
A wolf? I'm sorry, werewolf?
No--
I mean, not yet.
You know? Hell, just--
Just saying that out loud, I sound insane.
I don't think so.
But then again,
I always did believe in the crazy stuff.
According to my uncle, you have to trigger the curse.
Somebody has to die at your hands,
like murder, or an accident.
I basically have to cause death,
And then, boom, next full moon,
I'm howling on all fours.
Is that why he came back, to tell you all this?
Yeah, right. He had to tell me.
I caught him. He's not here for me.
He's here for this.
Down the stairs to the left.
Careful. The wooden bullets and vervain
Won't keep them down for long.
What is this place?
Old slave quarters from the original Lockwood house.
Go on.
Thank you, Mason. I appreciate all you've done.
We got it from here.
Hey, you're going to kill them, right?
Yes. That's why you should go.
I'm here as the council, not the law.
You can't be a party to this.
It's for your own protection.
Liz, I don't care about--
Yes, but I do, and I'm not asking.
Good-bye, Mason.
Hey, just don't take any chances.
What is it?
They've been here.
What?
What are you two doing out here?
Have you seen Stefan?
Yeah, Elena, I've seen him.
I've seen Damon, too.
Where are they?
You don't need me for that.
I'll let your friend here sniff 'em out.
Does your mother know what you are?
I'm happy to tell her.
Don't be stupid.
Necks snap easy around here.
I can take you.
Want to bet?
Yeah, I do.
Told you.
Come on.
This is how it's going to work.
Answer me, and you don't get shot. Understand?
How many of you are there?
Liz, please...
How did you fool us?
How do you walk in the sun?
I will drag this out painfully.
But you're my friend.
Our friendship was a lie.
Answer me, and I'll kill you fast.
What is that?
he's not gonna tell us anything
kill them both
Caroline.
Caroline, what is it?
My mom. She's killing them.
What?
No, no, no.
We have to stop her.
No, I can't.
Elena, she's going to find out about me.
Elena!
Let's do this. Each with a stake in the heart,
Then burn them both.
Check it out.
Elena! What are you doing?
You can't kill them. I'm not going to let you.
What was that? Who else is with you?
What the--
Hi, mom.
You need to drink some deputy blood.
Oh, no.
I'll be fine.
It's going to take a little bit longer.
Damon's right, you know.
If there's ever a time to break your diet--
He said he didn't want it, ok?
This is a most unfortunate situation.
2 deputies dead.
And you.
What am I going to do with you?
You won't tell anyone, will you?
Mom?
Mom? Please!
Look, I know that we don't get along,
and that you hate me,
but I'm your daughter. And you'll do this for me, right?
Mom, please.
He will kill you.
Then kill me.
No.
I can't take this.
Kill me now.
But you were going to drag it out so painfully.
No, no, no-
Damon, don't!
Damon, please!
Relax, guys. No one's killing anybody.
You're my friend.
We got to clean this up.
What is it?
It's a moonstone. I looked it up online.
It's a natural rock, but they're supposed to have
all sorts of supernatural legends attached to them.
Why haven't you given it to him?
'cause he wants it.
I'm a dick that way.
It's important to him, for some reason,
But I don't trust the guy.
So, I'm not just going to hand it to him.
Found you.
Hey, you guys are missing all the drinking.
Oh, um, sorry. Were you two having a moment?
No, we're good.
Hey, hey. What is that?
It's--whoa. Hey.
That's pretty.
Mm-hmm.
OK. Let's not play with the rock.
Well, come and get it.
Look, I'll play along for a little bit,
but seriously, give it back.
Lookie here.
You snooze, you lose.
You're lucky you're cute when you're drunk.
I want Jeremy to come get it.
Give me a break.
Sarah, don't be a bad drunk.
Jeremy, come upstairs with me.
See how bad a drunk I can be.
I'm good, thanks.
Seriously, just give it. This isn't funny!
All right. Easy.
Hey, that hurts.
Easy there. Just let me-- let go.
Sarah!
Oh, my God!
Sarah! Sarah!
She fell!
She's not moving!
Oh, my God.
Fooled you.
Oh, my God.
You pushed me down the stairs.
Look, he didn't-- he didn't mean it, OK?
You got her?
Yeah.
Hey. Sorry. That took forever.
I just didn't know how long my mom was going to be here.
Damon says it will take 3 days tops
for the vervain to leave her system.
Maybe even sooner.
Get some bunny in you?
Yeah, I'm feeling much better. Thank you.
A stomach bug.
Yeah. It came on fast.
I'll definitely be out tomorrow...
Or longer. I'll text you.
Yeah.
Good night.
Thank you.
It's not exactly the ritz, but it's secure.
I brought you good thread count.
And once the vervain's worked its way out of your system,
I will compel you to forget everything,
and you'll be a free woman.
Keep Caroline away from me, please.
I don't want to see her.
She's your daughter, Liz.
Not anymore.
My daughter's gone.
You have no idea how wrong you are about that.
Stefan? I think that we should--
What are you doing?
Katherine took a little vervain every day
and built up a tolerance to it.
I could do the same with blood.
I could learn to control myself on it.
But you can't, Stefan. You don't have to.
I almost died tonight, Elena,
Because I was too weak.
But the last time that you drank human blood--
I told you I'd find a way to stop Katherine, didn't I?
Well, this is the way. This is the only way,
because she's stronger than me.
And unless that changes,
I can't protect you.
Can we talk about this later?
He can hear us wherever we are
because he drinks this.
This is-- this is the only thing that can help me.
Are you serious?
Or are you pretending to fight?
Because I can't tell if--
No, this is real.
No more pretend.
Can I take you home?
I can't go home.
Why not?
Because I'm scared.
Why are you scared?
Caroline, you can talk to me.
Katherine's going to be there,
and she's going to want me to tell
her everything that happened today.
She told me I had to spy on you
and report back to her.
I know.
And I've been so mad at you.
But then, I tried to put myself in your position
so that I could understand
why you would do this to me, and to Stefan,
because he's been such a friend to you.
Who did she threaten?
Matt.
She threatened Matt.
And I'm so scared of her, Elena.
I am so scared of her.
And you should be.
Caroline, we all should be.
Why is she doing this?
What does she want?
That's the million dollar question.
Hey, Sheriff. It's Mason Lockwood.
I just want to make sure everything went Ok today.
I didn't see you later, and...
Give me a call, will you?
Hey.
I almost killed a girl today.
What?
It was an accident. I was being stupid.
She's Ok, though.
But there I was.
You know, just for a moment,
for a split second, I hoped she'd die.
Look, whatever this is inside me,
I don't want any part of it.
I don't ever want to feel that way again.
I won't.
I can't.
I know.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Caroline's sleeping on the couch.
I heard. And you?
I'm going home.
What you did for Caroline's Mom...
That's the Damon who was my friend.
Hey.
Stefan didn't drink the people blood,
if you were curious.
But he needs to.
And deep down, you know that.
You can come in.
Do you really think that you can control it?
I don't know.
But if I don't try...
So, a little bit every day?
Yeah, just a few drops
of blood in my system.
I think it's worth trying.
So do I.
But I don't want you to do it alone.
What are you doing?
It's you and me, Stefan.
Always.
I've been waiting.
Mason?
What happened?
Jimmy attacked me.
What? why?
He said that I hit on Marla.
Why would he think that?
He's dead.
I killed him.
Everything's going to be ok.
Uh. What was that stunt today
that you pulled with Damon and Stefan Salvatore?
I thought you'd be happy about that.
I told you to stay away from them.
Why do you even care?
I don't want you to get distracted.
I need you to find the moonstone.
You got it.
