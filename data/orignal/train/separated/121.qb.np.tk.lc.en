in monthly credit fees than you should be ?
thank you . good @-@ bye .
sizable sav ...
everything all right ?
yes . uh , i &apos;m sorry , um ,
what was the question again ?
the names of some friends i can interview ?
just to get a fuller picture ?
can i have a think on that ?
sure . um , why don &apos;t we turn to ...
will gardner ?
i think it might be a nice place to start your memoir ,
a brush with violence , you know ,
and then we go back to when you got started in the law .
i &apos;m just trying to find a structure here .
hello .
hello , mrs. florrick , how are you doing today ?
thank you , i &apos;m not interested .
i am calling from the cancer prevention league .
thank you , good @-@ bye .
grace . hi , how was school ?
good . m @-@ mom , what are you doing ?
nothing .
i just thought we &apos;d grab some pizza tonight .
oh , i &apos;m just dropping off my books .
janine &apos;s already downstairs . i have college prep tonight .
oh , right , i forgot .
i &apos;m gonna grab a bite beforehand .
i &apos;ll be back 11 : 00 .
okay . love you .
oh , and there &apos;s a package by the door . love you , too .
hello , mrs. solomon .
i wanted to thank you
for your $ 345 contribution .
thank you for your $ 100 contribution ,
mr. turgensenton @-@ tonkwanlon .
i &apos;m angry , too .
but i want you to know ...
well , i &apos;m sorry you feel that way .
hello , mr. tatro ?
yeah , who &apos;s this ?
uh , this is alicia florrick , and i want ...
oh , my god . oh , my god , it &apos;s her . babe , it &apos;s alicia .
what ?
uh , i wanted to call and thank you , sir .
we pretty much gave up .
i called you 30 times .
can you do it , alicia ? c @-@ can you help ?
uh ... i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry , mr. tatro ,
i think there &apos;s ... might be some confusion here .
i &apos;m just calling you to thank you for your donation .
i didn &apos;t make a donation , alicia .
i kept leaving messages at your campaign office because
i couldn &apos;t get you at work .
brett tatro ?
yes .
attempted murder .
yes .
you got me off six years ago .
i was the bouncer at the strip joint .
yeah .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry , i @-@ i didn &apos;t know who you were .
alicia ,
i was arrested four months ago
on first @-@ degree murder charges .
oh , my god ,
i &apos;m so sorry .
yeah , well , it &apos;s the same case ,
alicia . it &apos;s the same case .
what do you mean it &apos;s the same case ?
i mean the same case you got me off for--
they &apos;re trying me again .
they can &apos;t do that , brett .
you were found not guilty .
jeff died .
the man they said that i punched in 2009,
he @-@ he just died .
they said it doesn &apos;t matter that you got me off
for attempted murder .
i can now be tried for murder .
alicia , i ... i need your help .
brett , i ...
let me get you the name of a good lawyer .
no , wait , no , you &apos;re a good lawyer .
no . i @-@ i mean ,
yes , but i &apos;m not practicing law anymore .
alicia , i &apos;m going to court tomorrow .
just ... just come by and observe ?
i have a good lawyer for you , brett .
let me talk to him , i will call you back .
are we incognito ?
we are . laying low . thanks for coming .
no problem .
so this case-- it &apos;s an old client .
it &apos;s really unjust .
after six years , they &apos;re going after him for murder .
i don &apos;t know if i can take
the work load , alicia .
i &apos;m deep in two mail fraud trials right now .
but you should do it .
oh , no . i ...
i &apos;d do more harm than good .
what ? why ?
um , because i &apos;m busy with this memoir , and ...
and ...
i &apos;m ... well , i &apos;m having ...
a crisis of confidence , and it &apos;s taking up all my time .
i see . so it probably wouldn &apos;t help
to tell you to get back on the horse , then ?
it &apos;s just different when you &apos;re embarrassed
and everyone &apos;s staring at you .
for what ?
the election .
well , here &apos;s the good news .
you &apos;re not that important .
people aren &apos;t staring at you .
people are way too busy getting on with their lives , okay ?
so ... do it .
help this guy . he needs your help .
stop thinking about yourself , and
think about him .
i can &apos;t take another failure .
oh , well , then don &apos;t fail .
we asked for the record ... the defense would like ...
... of the earlier trial . ... the transcripts .
if i could finish-- your honor , this is a travesty .
the defense attorney is arguing double jeopardy ,
but mr. tatro is not being accused of the same crime .
your honor , if i could speak .
in 2009 we needed to prove that mr. tatro
had a specific intent to kill mr. jeffrey garrix .
and they failed . they did not ...
but now the charge is first- degree murder ,
and we don &apos;t need to prove intent .
this is an injustice . my father is a ...
excuse me . my @-@ my client is a father of three .
he &apos;s not a criminal .
i can &apos;t see what that has to do
with the charge , your honor .
in 2009,
mr. tatro viciously and repeatedly punched
and kicked a young man ,
putting him into a coma .
a coma he recovered from .
and now that young man has died
due to those injuries in 2009 .
okay , thank you both .
is this your first criminal trial , ms. audrey ?
it is , your honor . but it doesn &apos;t have to be
if you rule against the prosecution .
unfortunately , asa brody is right on the law .
this is not double jeopardy .
so commence pretrial motions tomorrow .
oh , alicia . thank you .
i &apos;m just here to check it out , brett , that &apos;s all .
uh , you remember my wife josie ?
oh , yes , hi . i didn &apos;t know you got married .
five years ago .
three little girls .
they &apos;re adorable .
wouldn &apos;t even exist if you hadn &apos;t gotten me off .
can you believe i &apos;d be halfway through my sentence right now ?
six years into a 12 @-@ year sentence .
what did you think about amber ?
your lawyer ? good .
she &apos;s a little nervous .
she couldn &apos;t get a word in edgewise .
well , matan can be rough on new lawyers .
he was that way with me .
i was just as nervous .
but you won .
alicia .
excuse me for a minute .
i didn &apos;t know you were on this , alicia .
i &apos;m just here observing , that &apos;s all .
it should be more interesting this time around .
not so easy to win .
really ? why &apos;s that ?
there &apos;s a hole in your case .
a hole ? what hole ?
you know , hey ,
sorry about the election .
people can be mean at first , but they &apos;ll forget soon enough .
a few months , it &apos;ll be like it never happened .
just like peter .
okay , let &apos;s get started .
alicia ? hi , how are you ?
good , actually , thank you .
uh , this is a business call .
what business ?
do you remember brett tatro ?
attempted murder . we fought it our first year .
he called here a few times ,
but we don &apos;t take cases like that anymore .
well , i need , uh , the file on the case .
uh , i don &apos;t want to go through david lee
and deal with the usual hassle .
are you representing him , alicia ?
i am .
well , that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s great .
sure , i &apos;ll get the files over . where ?
oh , just to my apartment.y
oh . right . you ... your apartment .
and , cary ,
do you remember if there was a hole in that case ?
anything we missed in the defense ?
no , but it was a long time ago . why ?
matan seems to think there &apos;s a hole he can exploit .
well , my guess is you &apos;ll find it in the files .
we were completists back then .
took notes on everything .
thanks .
sorry , do you mind if i record this ?
i just don &apos;t want to miss anything .
uh , no . sure , sure .
so how &apos;s this work again ?
well ,
stern , lockhart &amp; gardner offer a certain number
of associate hours to pro bono cases like yours .
free of charge .
well , i didn &apos;t do it .
i didn &apos;t beat that guy up .
jeff garrix ?
yeah , him .
i didn &apos;t lay a hand on him .
um , where did you meet him ?
was it at the nightclub ?
no , it was , uh , it was earlier than that .
dakota had a bachelor party at the sheraton . 12 guests .
jeff garrix was there ?
yes , ma &apos;am . yes , ma &apos;am ,
he thought that they had paid for topless and bottomless ,
so i had to explain to him the rules .
and he got angry ?
yeah . silly college kid .
so then he followed you back to the pink sapphire ?
yeah , dakota left behind some business cards .
and that &apos;s where you got in the fight with him
in the parking lot ?
nah , nah ,
i wasn &apos;t in the parking lot .
the police said they arrested you for fighting him
in the parking lot .
yeah , i mean , i know .
but like i told them , i wasn &apos;t there .
well , where were you ?
i was with lexie .
the tape recorder is just to aid me in my note @-@ taking .
sure . anything you need .
you want some water ?
no , thank you .
so , um ...
... you were with brett during the fight ?
oh , yeah . in my dressing room .
i wasn &apos;t feeling so good that night .
so ...
you &apos;re that lady with the husband , right ?
that &apos;s kind of vague .
yeah , um , i mean
the guy in jail . with the prostitutes .
i am .
i thought that was pretty cool--
you standing by him .
thank you . so , anything else , lexie ?
anything about brett ?
just that he &apos;s innocent .
and you &apos;ll testify to that ?
definitely .
it &apos;s my du ...
now , brett , if you weren &apos;t in the parking lot fight ,
how did you get these bruises on your face ?
all right , from @-@ from jeff garrix .
but at the sheraton .
we got in a fight over whether he had just topless or not .
alicia ,
do you have a moment ?
yes , of course .
thank you , mr ....
you &apos;ve probably noticed
a lot of this firm is about cooperation .
we &apos;re a family here , and we like to work together .
now , i know you two are in competition ,
and competition is always a healthy thing ,
but i want you to work on this pro bono case together .
the brett tatro case .
i &apos;m already deep into it , ms. lockhart .
yes , and cary will be your second chair .
use him as your stalking horse .
that &apos;s how we improve . okay ?
is there anything either of you want to say ?
no . all good .
same here .
you take the other bouncer-- daniel .
yeah , i &apos;ll take jeff garrix , too .
he won &apos;t talk to the defense .
he might ... if it &apos;s the right defense .
my lawyer told me not to talk to you .
said you &apos;d just try and distort what i say in court .
well , do i look like someone who would do that ?
so , how are your legs ?
it &apos;s my spine . your client kicked me in the back ,
almost crippled me for life .
what &apos;s your name ?
kalinda .
kalinda what ?
kalinda none of your business .
brett tatro said that you also had an encounter
at the sheraton prior to the parking lot .
oh , really ? how convenient for him .
he has to explain away his bruises somehow .
so you &apos;re saying there was no fight earlier in the evening ?
i wasn &apos;t even in the room with him .
it was a suite .
some of us were watching football in the bedroom .
we don &apos;t really allow bachelor parties in here anymore .
it was one of the last ones .
because of the fight ?
and all the noise . the guests complained .
i had to come down here and send them out ,
and told them to go to their strip joint ,
if that &apos;s really what they wanted to do .
where &apos;s the tv ?
we don &apos;t have one in here
while we &apos;re switching to flat screen .
was there a tv in here
on the night of the bachelor party ?
no .
garrix couldn &apos;t have been watching football on tv ,
because there was no tv .
you &apos;re sure ?
positive .
okay , good .
and get the stripper , too .
the one who went to the bachelor party .
dakota .
yeah . get her to confirm that there was no tv .
good . i will .
oh , and , alicia ,
write this down-- 1219 berkoff .
okay , got it . what is it ?
it &apos;s where i &apos;m buying you drinks tonight .
you don &apos;t have to do that .
i was just doing my job .
8 : 00 p.m. , 1219 berkoff .
let go !
no !
yeah , the bachelor party started out fine ,
but it got kind of touch @-@ and @-@ go .
and did you see the victim ,
jeff garrix , in the bedroom ?
mm @-@ hmm .
was there a tv ... was he watching a tv there ?
no , &apos; cause there wasn &apos;t a tv .
okay , good , great . and
when the bachelor party followed you back here ,
there was a fight in the parking lot , right ?
yeah .
but brett wasn &apos;t there &apos; cause he was taking care
of a sick lexie , right ?
well , i know that &apos;s what brett said .
are you saying that &apos;s not true ?
well , i don &apos;t want to hurt brett .
let me stop you right there , dakota .
alicia , why don &apos;t we just ... why don &apos;t we turn off the tape ?
now , i don &apos;t know what you were gonna say , dakota ,
but i want to tell you ,
brett &apos;s whole defense is his alibi .
you , of course , should testify to the truth .
just know that if you contradict brett &apos;s alibi ,
it might hurt him .
you want me to say
brett &apos;s telling the truth ?
no .
i want you to be careful
in your understanding of what you might say .
cary , you can &apos;t do that .
do what ?
tell her to lie .
i didn &apos;t tell her to lie .
i told her about the consequences
of her actions , that &apos;s all .
oh , come on . are you serious ?
she was about to contradict brett &apos;s alibi .
we don &apos;t know that .
this is not the way i want to practice the law .
oh , what , you mean successfully ?
so , what if the prosecution gets to her ?
they won &apos;t .
we have an alibi witness .
that &apos;s all we need .
there &apos;s the hole .
it &apos;s not dakota anymore .
it &apos;s dani .
sorry , dani .
i just have a few questions .
not pink .
what is she , a wedding cake ?
you &apos;re doing very well .
yeah .
saved up my money from those two years dancing .
by the way , no one here knows that i used to do that ,
so let &apos;s keep it quiet ?
what do you need ?
you know brett &apos;s being prosecuted again ?
i heard . i &apos;m sorry .
has the prosecution approached you about that night ?
no . why ? will they ?
they might . they think
there was a hole in our last defense .
and i know you had some ...
hesitation about brett &apos;s alibi .
you &apos;re wondering if i &apos;ll contradict his alibi ?
no , i just want to lay out the consequences
for contradicting brett and lexie &apos;s alibi .
don &apos;t worry about it .
i see no upside to dredging up my past
in any shape or form .
give me a minute , will you ?
of course , dakot ... dani .
here &apos;s the thing .
i may not be a problem ,
but did you hear about lexie ?
no . what ?
she died ... four years ago .
drug overdose . really sad .
maybe that &apos;s the hole in the defense .
i &apos;ll drop the charge to second @-@ degree .
that &apos;s the lowest i &apos;ll go .
come on .
the victim could have died
for any one in a million reasons .
32 years old , he dies from a brain hemorrhage
doctors can tie directly
to that fight in 2009 .
matan , you lost six years ago . get over it .
i have a stronger case this time .
because lexie &apos;s dead ?
i don &apos;t need lexie .
i have her testimony from 2009 .
then reject my deal .
what do you have , matan ?
what i have is some advice for you .
you go to trial , you &apos;ll lose .
that &apos;s first @-@ degree murder , 20 years minimum ,
serving every single day .
i &apos;ll see you in court .
mrs. florrick . i am such a fan .
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;ll be joining me .
oh , thank you . i &apos;m glad , too .
i told my mom i &apos;d be working with you .
she wanted me to get a picture .
do you mind ? um ...
she loved how you stood by your husband .
she wants to meet you .
okay , let &apos;s talk strategy for a minute ,
brett . amber ?
yes . good . hold on . i &apos;m just sending this .
okay , the whole point is to win in pretrial motions .
if this goes to trial , the jury can do anything .
even if you are innocent ,
judge dunaway isn &apos;t my biggest fan .
so i &apos;m gonna need you , amber ,
to take some of the motions .
i &apos;m ready . excited really .
how do you want to attack this ?
all rise . court is now in session .
the honorable judge dunaway presiding .
thank you all . you may sit .
mr. brody and ms. audrey ...
well , actually , you ... you have someone new here .
yes , your honor . alicia florrick ,
asking leave of the court to join as co @-@ counsel .
any objections , mr. brody ?
none , your honor .
we do not hold the recent election scandal
against alicia florrick at all .
of course , that &apos;s why you brought it up ,
so it won &apos;t be held against her .
yes , mrs. florrick ,
you are more than welcome to join the party .
take a seat .
now , pretrial motions-- what do you have ?
argue for the inclusion of the transcript now .
your honor , the defense would like the transcripts to be ...
we ask that the record of the earlier trial be excluded
from the records as prejudicial , your honor .
the prosecution wants to exclude this transcript for ...
yes , we do .
the jury should have a clean hearing of the evidence .
we &apos;re not arguing that .
they should not be tainted by the knowledge
of an earlier trial .
hold on .
let the defense speak .
thank you , your honor .
i &apos;m not ... uh ...
it &apos;s okay .
take a breath .
thank you .
the prosecution is trying to prevent the jury
from hearing brett &apos;s alibi .
one of the witnesses has died ,
and our only record of her testimony
is in this previous trial .
she &apos;s exactly right , your honor .
that &apos;s exactly why we want to exclude this transcript .
because this witness ,
a stripper named lexie bromwich ,
perjured herself on the stand .
do you have evidence to that effect ?
why , i do .
thank you , mrs. florrick .
uh , daniel cain .
uh , my occupation now is ... :
not much .
beer drinker .
um , but i used to work as a bouncer at the pink sapphire .
you worked with the defendant mr. tatro ?
yes , i did .
hey , brett .
do you have any memory of lexie bromwich ?
yeah , i do .
i went to her funeral . poor kid .
do you have reason to disbelieve
her testimony from the first trial ?
yeah . she was high .
objection .
on what grounds ?
on the ... give me a sec . grounds ?
hearsay ?
mr. cain , do you have firsthand knowledge
that lexie bromwich was using drugs on the day in question ?
yes , i do .
i saw her .
not only that .
she testified for brett &apos; cause he was her dealer .
so , you were a bodyguard with brett that night ?
no . no , just afterwards .
one of these college kids came running in ...
from the bachelor party ?
right . yeah .
he came in screaming ,
so i went out to see what was going on .
it was ...
your mom won &apos;t ...
... mind if we use this ?
i don &apos;t know . she uses it for work .
well , we have to hear what you sound like .
you ready ?
now , i &apos;m going to stand right here .
and remember , enunciate .
aung san suu was born in 1945 in rangoon .
who &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s who my speech is on .
what is she , persian ?
hey , alicia . everything all right ?
yeah , sorry to bother you .
i &apos;ve run into a problem
with some of the evidence
that you dug up on the brett tatro trial .
cary ?
cary ?
i &apos;m sorry . what &apos;s the problem ?
remember when we co @-@ chaired the trial ,
we had an argument over trial strategy ?
no .
yes .
you thought that the jury would want
someone to blame for the beating ,
and i wanted to put all the emphasis on the alibi .
right , right , it was a good call . we won .
yes , but you were collecting evidence
on the other bouncer daniel .
you wanted to blame him .
do you have the files on that ?
check the files i sent you .
the interview with daniel should be in there .
yeah , someone recorded over it .
let me see what i have .
at this moment , aung san suu kyi
is still under house arrest .
that was very good .
you have a very good speaking voice .
thanks , grandma .
what was her name again ?
aung san suu kyi .
you know , your dad was interested in people like that .
arabs and russians
and things like that .
like who ? can you remember who ?
some russian guy .
vackel ?
vaclav havel ?
yes .
when he was your age ,
he wanted to be like him .
why ? can you remember why ?
oh , you know , justice .
things like that .
you &apos;re a lot like your dad .
he wants to make things better for people .
i know .
give me a hug .
he loves you , you know .
i know .
you &apos;re a good boy .
you &apos;re gonna change the world just like your dad .
you &apos;ve reached zach &apos;s voice mail .
i &apos;m in class right now or sleeping it off .
zach . hi . it &apos;s mom .
we haven &apos;t talked in a while .
cary . you could have sent someone .
yes , i could have .
you had all this stuff ,
and you never showed it to me ?
i did try to show you ,
but you wanted to take the case in another direction .
you didn &apos;t try to show me .
i did .
you always thought i was more competitive than i really was .
you were competitive .
yeah , i was .
wow . it &apos;s a lot of work .
oh , not really .
so , how &apos;s it going ?
i don &apos;t know .
they &apos;re trying to throw out the alibi .
you know what ?
we &apos;re better lawyers now .
makes sense . we were young .
yeah , but there &apos;s still something i miss about it .
what ?
looking at the law as something good .
do you think it &apos;s not good ?
no , i think it &apos;s ... neutral .
kalinda &apos;s gone .
i know .
did you see her ?
no . did you ?
she &apos;s not really one for good @-@ byes .
i know .
i &apos;m sorry .
me , too .
well ... hope you get to use this stuff against daniel .
it &apos;s like a director &apos;s cut .
wouldn &apos;t mind finally seeing it shown .
then let &apos;s show it .
mr. cain , in a news report from 2009 , you claimed
you were never in the parking lot where the fight took place .
is that still true ?
uh @-@ huh .
&quot; uh @-@ huh , &quot; uh , meaning &quot; yes &quot; ?
yes .
correct . affirmative .
and yet , in this crime scene photo ,
the front of your clothes seem to be covered in blood .
so ?
so , how did the blood get there ?
i cradled his head in my lap .
after you hit him ?
no . no , after brett hit him , or someone .
so , you were in the parking lot ?
afterward .
after the fight .
okay .
did you make a 911 call after the fight ?
did i ? no .
did you have possession of your cell phone ?
i did . why ?
oh , there &apos;s a record of a 911 call from your cell phone ,
but the call was terminated before you said anything .
would you like to revise your testimony , mr. cain ?
i ... guess i called ,
but the guy was bleeding ,
and i saw a lot of other people calling .
i ... i &apos;m not lying .
so it &apos;s not a strip club anymore .
no , it &apos;s a charter school .
okay .
i need you to get the names
of the people you worked with here ,
a @-@ anyone you can remember .
why ?
well , we need another way
to establish your alibi in case the judge rules against us .
just anyone you can think of , and we &apos;ll try and locate them .
what &apos;s wrong , brett ? what &apos;s going on ?
tell them .
just so you know ,
i &apos;m innocent . i did not touch that kid in that parking lot .
but ?
but i was in the parking lot .
but i @-@ i didn &apos;t do this , alicia . i didn &apos;t .
i was headed back to the car to get something for dakota .
that &apos;s all .
to get what ?
to get what ?
you were her dealer ?
i was a different person .
i &apos;ve changed .
so you got dakota to lie for you ?
you need to help me . please .
please . i &apos;m innocent .
but we know it &apos;s perjury now .
we know that the alibi is false .
we know that brett was in that parking lot .
he told us so .
yes ,
but we &apos;re not putting him on the stand ,
so we &apos;re not suborning perjury .
yes .
okay , but we are allowing dakota &apos;s testimony
to be entered into the record , a testimony we know is false .
we have to tell the judge .
no . listen , amber .
when we argued for the transcript to be admitted ,
we didn &apos;t know it was false .
yes , but we do now .
right , but that doesn &apos;t matter .
when we argued for it yesterday , we didn &apos;t know .
that doesn &apos;t seem right .
i know . but it &apos;s legal .
i think i have a lot to learn .
all rise .
thank you . please be seated .
i &apos;m allowing the whole
2009 transcript into evidence .
your honor .
matan , you are welcome to call your witness to testify
if we do go to trial , and , mrs. florrick , you &apos;re welcome
to impeach him , just like you both did here .
your honor , you mention &quot; if we do go to trial . &quot;
will you rule on our motion to dismiss ?
our client was already found not guilty .
we have one more witness , your honor .
evan houston . do you want to know
what i do now or what i did then ?
let &apos;s try then .
well , i worked in a gas station
across the street from the strip joint , the , um , pink sapphire .
was he in the previous trial ?
no .
someone new .
and did you see that man
over there on the night in question ?
yeah . he was in the parking lot .
he was beating some kid up .
thank you , sir .
mr. houston , this is your first time
testifying against my client .
why didn &apos;t you come forward six years ago ?
i did come forward six years ago .
i told the police the exact same thing i &apos;m telling you .
what police ?
a detective named hardy .
you did ? were you too sick to testify ?
were you out of town , sir ?
no , i was here .
but the prosecution didn &apos;t want you to testify ?
objection . argumentative .
let it go , matan . you may answer .
they said they didn &apos;t need me .
how did you ...
i.d.
my client , mr. houston ?
in a lineup .
i wasn &apos;t aware my client was in
a lineup .
a photo lineup .
you looked good in there , i thought .
no . we &apos;re losing .
the judge is gonna allow this to go to trial .
i saw him with this new witness .
he seemed convinced .
you know , when i was an a.s.a. ,
i was told to double @-@ check
cases coming through a certain detective &apos;s hands .
why is that ?
&apos;cause he was old @-@ school .
if he didn &apos;t get photo array results he liked ,
he &apos;d reshuffle the mug shots and ask the eyewitness to try again .
or he &apos;d place a finger on the suspect &apos;s photo .
how do you know that ?
there was an i.a.d. investigation .
inconclusive . they dropped it about a year ago .
who was the detective ?
hardy .
that &apos;s why matan didn &apos;t put evan on the stand in 2009 .
he was worried about the photo array .
that would be my guess .
thank you .
i didn &apos;t say anything .
thank you for coming in , detective hardy .
no problem . it &apos;s my job .
in what way did the eyewitness ,
evan houston , i.d. my client ?
was it by lineup or photo array ?
photo array .
and did he identify him right away ?
yes .
you didn &apos;t need to take him through the photos a second time
because he was prone to misidentify ?
objection . asked and answered .
and yet i &apos;d like to hear the answer a second time .
detective ?
no ,
i did not take him through a second time .
isn &apos;t there a slang for this in the department ,
the act of running a photo array past the witness a second time ?
yeah , might be . i @-@ i don &apos;t know it .
p.o.e. process of elimination .
fascinating .
detective , wasn &apos;t there an internal affairs investigation
into your use of these photo arrays .
objection !
uh , i haven &apos;t even gotten the question out yet ,
your honor . this is disgusting .
i.a.d. investigations are confidential .
yes ,
but i &apos;m asking the detective about
a specific practice that has a crucial bearing
on this case , his use of photo arrays .
then ask him the question . don &apos;t ...
i am asking him the question .
did i.a.d. ever investigate you for faulty photo arrays ,
and is that the only reason why
evan houston was not included in the first trial ?
excuse me , your honor , i want a ruling .
was it because evan houston only selected
my client &apos;s photo after being shown his photo
in two separate photo arrays .
objection ! object @-@ objection !
all right . thank you . why don &apos;t we all calm down now ?
mrs. florrick , you got out your question ,
which is what you wanted .
matan , you registered your disgust ,
which is what you wanted .
why don &apos;t you all come up here now ?
where did you hear of this i.a.d. report , ma &apos;am ?
your honor , if there &apos;s no public knowledge
of an i.a.d investigation ,
that means the officer was cleared .
or there was lack of evidence .
obviously
but that &apos;s the whole point .
there was some sort of ...
we don &apos;t know .
thank you . thank you , matan . you might be right ,
but i don &apos;t know how much i trust your detective .
your honor , that is unfair .
it &apos;s based on rumor @-@ mongering .
yes ,
and that is why i &apos;m asking mrs. florrick how she knows this .
the way she &apos;s always known it , through her husband
or her law partner , cary agos .
how do you know about the i.a.d. report ,
mrs. florrick ?
and if one of them did slip this to her ,
they &apos;re in trouble ,
because this work product is confidential .
they could be disbarred or be imprisoned .
matan , stop .
mrs. florrick , it &apos;s a simple question .
how do you know about the i.a.d. report ?
i can &apos;t say , your honor .
why can &apos;t you say ?
because i am bound .
well , that is unfortunate
because you &apos;re gonna have to unbound yourself pretty quick ,
or you &apos;ll be found in contempt . sheriff .
i would like to consult with counsel , your honor .
you don &apos;t want to test me , mrs. florrick .
i &apos;m not testing you , your honor .
you take the night to consult with counsel .
and come in tomorrow prepared to answer .
mr. kingsley @-@ weaver . i &apos;m so sorry .
did we have a meeting today ?
i thought we did , unless we got our wires crossed .
no . um , i &apos;ve been ... distracted .
your daughter let me in .
she &apos;s very sweet .
thank you .
she showed me your pictures in there .
all the murder photos .
it &apos;s quite grisly . can you tell me about it ?
it might help me with the structure .
i ... mm .
but it &apos;s wrong , isn &apos;t it ?
cary basically told the witness to lie .
she was gonna contradict brett &apos;s alibi .
did you tell her to lie ?
no , but ...
do you believe in the client ?
what do you mean ?
well , do you think that your client &apos;s telling the truth ?
i don &apos;t know if he &apos;s telling the full truth .
nobody ever tells the full truth .
ever .
god , you &apos;re such a cynic .
no , just ... experienced .
look , alicia ,
do you think that your client beat this guy up ?
no .
then it &apos;s all right for you to do everything
within the law to defend him .
not even all right . it &apos;s your duty .
but is it all right to lie ?
not under oath .
okay .
here &apos;s to experience .
experience .
hey . sorry about the mess i left in the dining room .
that &apos;s okay .
you on a case ?
i am .
that &apos;s good . you &apos;re happier when you &apos;re on a case .
really ?
yeah , i worry about you when you just sit at home .
i &apos;m thinking about starting my own firm .
what do you think about that ?
but you already started one , didn &apos;t you ?
yeah , but this would be different .
it would be to help people i wanted to help .
can you make money doing that ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess we &apos;ll have to see .
i &apos;d have to work out of the apartment .
in the dining room ?
no .
i don &apos;t know .
turn it on its side .
nice . okay . you ready ?
one , two , three .
three .
okay .
not bad , mom .
yep . back to basics .
hey , i could be your secretary .
i could answer your phone calls , get you coffee .
graduate from school .
no , i have to have an internship .
this can be it .
yeah .
we &apos;ll see .
hello .
hello . look , if this is sales ,
you &apos;d better hang up now or i will rip you a new one .
i &apos;m a lawyer , and that &apos;ll be my first case .
go , mom .
hello , mom . it &apos;s me .
zach .
hi . how are you ?
good .
i got your call . is everything okay ?
yes . great , in fact . really great .
good . i was thinking of coming home tomorrow night .
do you know what you &apos;re gonna do ?
maybe .
if he jails me ,
i need you to call cary agos .
sure . do you think it &apos;ll come to that ?
no idea .
all rise .
mrs. florrick . mr. brody .
up here .
well , okay , mrs. florrick ,
have you consulted with counsel ?
i have , your honor .
are you ready to tell us
who informed you about this i.a.d. investigation ?
well , first of all , your ...
no &quot; first of all . &quot;
tell me now or be held in contempt .
someone tried to help me , your honor .
someone who knew that detective hardy was ...
your honor , this is outrageous .
yes , it is . mrs. florrick ,
answer the question .
i will tell you
who informed me of the i.a.d. investigation ,
but i want to explain to you why they did it .
because justice matters to them .
they saw an injustice at the heart of this case ,
and i think you &apos;ve seen it , too , your honor .
mrs. florrick , who told you ?
kalinda sharma .
oh , come on .
this is b.s. , your honor . mrs. florrick is mentioning
the only person who is no longer in our jurisdiction .
i answered your question , your honor .
i &apos;m not sure what more the s.a ....
kalinda sharma fled our jurisdiction .
we cannot arrest her .
she did not do this . it &apos;s either cary agos
or her husband .
i answered your question , your honor .
yes , you did .
thank you , mrs. florrick .
on the record .
as to your motion to dismiss , i will sustain that .
your honor ...
no , matan .
you had your shot in 2009 . let it go .
mr. tatro ,
your case has been dismissed with prejudice .
thank you . thank you .
i &apos;m so glad this worked out , brett .
i want to learn from you .
no , you don &apos;t .
so ...
how &apos;s your crisis of confidence going ?
better .
i &apos;m so glad .
i &apos;m thinking of starting my own firm
and only taking cases i believe in ,
and i want to know if you &apos;ll join me .
