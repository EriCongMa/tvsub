they say love knows no bounds .
i don &apos;t know about that .
i feel like i &apos;ve seen the bounds
and pushed them a couple of times .
it &apos;s gonna rain .
it &apos;s not gonna rain .
told her to have the reception indoors .
this wedding is doomed even if it happens
because it &apos;s definitely going to rain .
you want it to rain . you are willing it to rain .
i am not willing it to rain .
she &apos;s just so full of feelings all the time .
why can &apos;t she just cram them down
and shut up like everybody else ?
you can &apos;t expect her to be cristina .
exactly my point .
she &apos;s definitely not cristina .
that &apos;s what i mean .
owen wants this ? owen &apos;s marrying this ?
he said yes when she asked .
jo still hasn &apos;t given you a reason ?
i don &apos;t need a reason .
she doesn &apos;t want to marry me . i &apos;m done . it &apos;s over .
maybe it &apos;s nobody &apos;s fault .
maybe you only get one .
one what ?
soul mate ? or true love ?
well , then , who ...
izzie ?
alex , izzie wasn &apos;t your one true love .
and even if she was --
what was derek ?
are you telling me that you think
that &apos;s coming around again ?
that was different .
how ?
love definitely has bounds .
i &apos;ve seen where it ends .
i told you it was gonna rain .
this wedding is doomed .
mom . mom ! mother !
i know i was engaged before . i was there .
no .
i am sober .
because we love each other .
because we didn &apos;t see a reason to wait .
because people get hit by cars .
we &apos;ve been together for a year .
yes , we broke up , and then we ...
so what if it has been off and on ?
oh , hey , don &apos;t let me forget the rings , and i called the --
what ?
i don &apos;t know , mom ...
amelia &apos;s mom .
no one in the family is coming to the wedding .
... ex @-@ daughter @-@ in @-@ law
what ?
and ask her permission to live my life .
because i do .
i &apos;m alone .
if you don &apos;t come , it is just me . mom .
mommy , please , i am getting married .
fine . yeah , no .
um ... okay . i understand .
yeah , it &apos;s so good to know that all of the best people
in this family are dead .
amelia , hey .
rain is supposed to be good luck .
okay .
hey , uh , do you want to go over there together ?
go over where ?
to the wedding .
do you want to drive over together , or --
well , at this point , i don &apos;t even know if i &apos;m going .
trauma &apos;s strapped for surgeons and residents .
blake is gone . wilson &apos;s off .
you could always put me back in .
don &apos;t .
yeah , i know , i know .
still , if you &apos;re shorthanded , mm , just makes sense .
ugh , good lord .
you &apos;re just like tuck .
i tell you no -- - you keep pushing and pushing
like it &apos;s gonna change my mind .
you don &apos;t think four months is long enough
for me to learn my lesson ?
on a six @-@ month suspension ? no , i don &apos;t .
if you think a scheduling glitch
will suddenly make me trust you again in an o.r. --
wait . &quot; trust me &quot; ?
what do you mean &quot; trust me &quot; ?
no , no . i get that you needed to discipline me ,
but you don &apos;t trust me with patients ?
it was a grave error in judgment .
and you &apos;re gonna trust me again in two more months ?
that &apos;s what it will take ?
miranda , should i be here at all ?
i &apos;ll see you at the wedding .
i don &apos;t feel good about how quiet it is in there .
she &apos;s fine .
you have no idea how many people have locked themselves
in that bathroom .
they &apos;re always fine .
i am serious , mer . i &apos;m worried about her .
this is her wedding day .
it &apos;s supposed to be the happiest day of her life ,
the -- the magic day , the love day .
amelia , we &apos;re here for you , okay ?
as long as it takes .
20 more minutes
and i &apos;m ripping the door off the hinges !
amelia , stuff your feelings in !
what ? it &apos;s not my love day . i have things to do .
okay . where is she ?
oh , thank god .
amelia , open the door .
amelia ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
if they don &apos;t want to be here , then ...
they shouldn &apos;t be .
we don &apos;t want them .
they don &apos;t get it , and they don &apos;t have to .
i do .
and i &apos;ll be there .
and the only one i want there is you .
you &apos;re not supposed to see me before the wedding .
it &apos;s bad luck .
i &apos;ll close my eyes . i won &apos;t see a thing .
come out , amelia .
come out and marry me .
okay .
go . i will see you at the church .
i am an excellent best man .
40 @-@ something male --
multiple stab wounds to the abdomen and arm .
he broke into an elderly woman &apos;s apartment and attacked her .
oh , for god &apos;s sake .
and the lady fought the bastard off with a carving knife .
damn , gram !
... being controlled by an inflated pressure cuff .
vitals are holding so far .
aah ! i was boiling an egg .
he scared me near to death .

and i love you .

i told you that i love you ...
and that i &apos;m not going anywhere .
so isn &apos;t that enough ? can &apos;t that be enough for you ?

we &apos;ve been through hell .
you know , all kinds of drama --
crazy family stuff , we both almost died ,
losing people we love .
no , y @-@ you &apos;re not losing me .
the point is , we grew up .

and hell is behind me .
it &apos;s in my rearview mirror , and i &apos;m not going back .
i &apos;m done .

i don &apos;t have any ideas , okay ?

i &apos;m not trying to be mean .
i just -- i don &apos;t want you to get too attached .
i have three children , a big job .
okay , you jumped me .
okay , not that i minded .
it was good .
we had a good time .
it was very good .
i don &apos;t know about you ,
but that was some of my best work .
and in a car , which is not easy .
but now what ?
now you think , what , you &apos;re my sun and my moon ,
that all of a sudden
i think that the stars shine down on only you ,
that you touched me and the heavens opened
and i -- i &apos;m blinded by the angel that is you ?
i mean , you &apos;re good , but nobody &apos;s that good .
i did jump you , didn &apos;t i ?
yeah . you did .
okay , well , point taken . you are not after me .
i &apos;m not after you .
we are friends
who maybe have sex .

big day today .
big step .
really big step .
meredith , why do you have a problem
with me marrying your sister ?
i don &apos;t , but i &apos;m responsible .
i mean , he left her to me , and she left you to me .
i &apos;m not a piece of property
for cristina to just hand over for safekeeping .
i haven &apos;t told her . does she know ?
no .
don &apos;t you think you should call her
and tell her before you do this ?
why would i do that ?
she was the love of your life .
if it were me , i would call derek --
i don &apos;t know --
just to see if it came close to what we had .
okay , look up for me .
amelia .
this is your love day .
it is a happy day .
it &apos;s so happy .
i &apos;m happy .
amelia .
nothing .
derek was supposed to walk me down the aisle .
my dad &apos;s gone , and he &apos;s always --
he walked every one of my sisters down the aisle .
well , i &apos;m here , and meredith will be here any minute ,
and we will all be together .
i left the rings ...
i don &apos;t remember where i left the rings .
well , uh , they say if you think out loud
while you &apos;re looking for something , you find it faster .
who says ?
scientists ... who lose things .
okay . okay . all right .
i remember there was one point that i went upstairs .
you okay ?
yep . i &apos;m fine .
uh , i went upstairs , - and amelia was in the bathroom .
and -- okay .
i &apos;m here . sorry i &apos;m late .
i had two patients i had to discharge ,
and owen just had cuff @-@ link issues .
are you okay ?
amelia ?
you should probably go .
where &apos;s maggie ?
she &apos;s checking on the weather .
it &apos;s raining . didn &apos;t you notice ?
what &apos;s wrong ? what &apos;s happening ?
what can i do ?
what can you do ?
what can you do ?
what -- that -- that is amazing .
that is an amazing question .
what can you do ?
amelia .
meredith , i am flipping out here .
i &apos;m wearing a wedding gown .
there is a good and decent man in there
who loves me and is expecting to marry me ,
and i can &apos;t tell if i am marrying because i love him back
or because i just ran here and picked up a scalpel
and slipped into this shepherd skin .
and maybe it is right , and maybe it &apos;s not ,
but i don &apos;t know ,
and i am marrying cristina &apos;s husband .
i know what you think about that .
and i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing .
and there is no one here with me .
there is no one here to tell me to quit
or get me down the aisle or j-- help me .
that is derek &apos;s job , and derek is dead .
and all i have is maggie ,
and maggie is full of sunshine and candy and hope ,
and every time i try to tell her that the world is on fire ,
she hands me a marshmallow to roast ,
so that just leaves you .
and you -- you are rooting for the other guy .
you told me to go and be with owen ,
and then you turned on me ,
and now you are not on my side .
and we both know you don &apos;t like me ,
but you are stuck with me .
so here i am in a wedding gown
on the happiest fricking day of my life
in a room with no family and no help
and no one on my side but you .
so what can you do for me ?
what can you do for me , meredith ?
you &apos;re me .
what ?
you &apos;re me before derek .
i can be here for you .
i know how to do this .
i can be a trusted sister for you .
just how do you want to play this ?
do you need me to tell you you &apos;re a beautiful bride
and kick your ass down that aisle ?
you &apos;re a beautiful bride .
turn around . i &apos;ll start kicking .
do you need me to call your mother and yell at her ?
i &apos;m your girl .
if you need a shoulder to cry on , i have two .
if you want to freak out and call it off ,
if you want to run , - i &apos;ll drive the getaway car .
just let me know what you need .
i &apos;m here for you .
i am your family , amelia .
today , i am your person .
just tell me what you want to do .
what are you doing ?
we &apos;re running .
where are we running ?
doesn &apos;t matter . let &apos;s go !
oh , god . so many people . all those people !
okay , stop it .
and the food ! oh , my -- all that food .
stop . don &apos;t do that .
the food doesn &apos;t matter .
amelia &apos;s what matters .
right . okay . what happened ?
nothing happened .
what &apos;s wrong with owen ?
nothing &apos;s wrong with owen .
well , he could use some sun .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with owen .
then why are we doing this ?
okay , so then i hung up the phone ,
and i went over to the table and
what ? wha-- w @-@ what ?

and she wouldn &apos;t even go to owen &apos;s wedding .
i feel like i should do something .
robbins , there &apos;s nothing you can do .
this isn &apos;t your business anymore .
i -- - now , look , she lost her child .
the woman she loved moved across the country .
so , no , she &apos;s not okay .
the only thing you can do is get okay with it yourself .
it &apos;s over . i had the love of my life ,
and i just -- pssh -- pushed him away , and now he &apos;s gone .
i lost him .
let &apos;s not overstate this .

okay . right .
tap it and let it settle
and then tap it some more .
you get more that way .

i didn &apos;t make you run . you wanted to run .
you dangled the carrot .
you -- you dangled it because you didn &apos;t want
this wedding to happen , so you dangled .
i didn &apos;t dangle anything .
you &apos;re not a victim here .
i presented you with a menu of options .
you chose to run .
you wanted to run .
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
why am i marrying owen ?
is my family right ?
is this just one more in a long line
of ill @-@ advised , impulsive decisions ?
i don &apos;t even know .
shouldn &apos;t i know ?
shouldn &apos;t i know on my wedding day ?
probably .
mer .
i mean , what if i &apos;m just -- what if owen is my new drug
and i &apos;m just using him to ignore the fact that ...
that what ?
that mer &apos;s right ,
that owen &apos;s had the love of his life and so have i ,
and once it &apos;s gone , everything else is just filler
and you &apos;ll never , ever have that feeling again .
i mean , who gets that twice ?
some of us would like to have it once .
so , he just kept asking me to marry him again and again .
i just couldn &apos;t say nothing anymore , you know ,
so i just ... i just said no .
you could &apos;ve said yes .
here you go .
i should go home .
i need to go home .
what ? whoa . no , no , no , no , no .
you cannot drive home .
no , stupid , i &apos;m gonna call .
i &apos;m looking for my phone to call a goober .
i can &apos;t marry him .
i want to , but i can &apos;t marry anyone .
why &apos;s that ?
just &apos; cause -- none of your business .
okay . right . sorry .
god , where is my . oh , my god !
what ?
this isn &apos;t even my purse .
yeah , what can i get you ?
i can &apos;t marry him because i &apos;m already married .
okay , okay .
it &apos;s done . go . do it .
okay , you just relax , all right ?
you know the drill .
you &apos;re gonna feel my hand ...
okay .
okay , warren , let &apos;s wrap it up .
sorry . i just -- i @-@ i -- i can &apos;t --
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m --
come on . you &apos;ve done a pelvic before , haven &apos;t you ?
yeah , plenty , plenty , but t @-@ this doesn &apos;t feel right .
don &apos;t tell me it doesn &apos;t feel right .
it &apos;s my freaking cervix .
just check how dilated it is , and get out of my va--
a @-@ april , april ,
it &apos;s a foot .
i feel a foot .
no .
it &apos;s breech .
it &apos;s a footling breech .
okay . okay .
and -- and i feel the cord .
wha-- ?
no . no .
is -- is there a pulse ?
answer me !
i don &apos;t think so , no .
no .
so my baby &apos;s gonna die ?
no . no , april . no .
no , it just means that it &apos;s not getting
all the blood that it could be and that --
that we have to get the baby out as fast as possible
so we can get the pressure off the cord .
okay . okay .
so i need a c @-@ section soon as possible .
yes . yes .
okay , okay , okay .
okay , um ...
so ... okay .
so ...
the light is better in the kitchen .
what ? wait , wait , wait . no . no . no .
i &apos;m not giving you a c @-@ section .
look , there &apos;s an ambulance coming . ben , we both know
it doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;m not doing it . i can &apos;t . we &apos;ll get you to the hospital .
my baby is dying , its blood supply is cut off ,
and it &apos;s going to die .
there is an ambulance coming !
ben ! ben !
even if they were here now , they can &apos;t help me .
you can .
i @-@ it &apos;s coming . it &apos;s coming .
come on .
okay , i know , ben .
i know . i &apos;m coming . i got held --
well , um , on the plus side , um , you &apos;re well @-@ liked .
a lot of people came .
and nobody wants to rush you .
they just want to know what &apos;s gonna happen .
what do you think ?
here &apos;s what i think , karev .
i think if you get to the point
where you &apos;re gonna walk down the aisle with someone ,
she &apos;s earned some trust ... and faith .
she &apos;s earned the benefit of the doubt .
so i &apos;m giving it to her .
she deserves that .
you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re absolutely right .
are we going in ?
why are you looking at me ?
amelia ?
i don &apos;t know .
if we don &apos;t go in , where would we go ?
why &apos;s everybody asking me ?
come on , mer .
what do i know about getting married ?
and who am i to say we only get one great love in our life ?
lots of people get two .
look at ...
look at ...
well , i don &apos;t know . i can &apos;t think of any right now , but --
richard webber .
yes ! exactly . thank you .
richard webber . exactly . you see ?
maybe we get two ,
maybe we get 11 , maybe we get 30 .
isn &apos;t that better , just to believe that ?
yeah . i mean , owen believes it .
i swear he does .
and he loves you .
so maybe this time is different for you .
maybe this time , you &apos;re right .
all right , now , listen .
there &apos;s no anesthesia .
ice is all we got , so the pain &apos;s gonna --
the pain &apos;s gonna be bad .
okay . all right ?
okay .
why is she at meredith &apos;s ? i got to get my keys .
no , no . there &apos;s no time .
here .
right . you rotate the baby in utero -- face down .
no , i know . the position will look different than you &apos;ve seen .
okay .
is she okay ?
april ? april ?
hey , april ? can she hear me ?

dr. warren .
dr. robbins tells me that
you showed superb technique
under trying conditions .
she said you saved two lives today .
we knock them down , build them back up ,
and knock them down again ...
but does it have to be that way ?
hi , mama !

plane tickets .

and i want all summer and every other school year .
i want christmas this time , but you can get next time ...
... and we &apos;ll figure out the rest of the details .
what ? are you saying --
listen , we did this wrong .
we had a chance to do it right ,
and ... we missed it .
are you saying ... ?
i &apos;m saying that
sofia deserves to have two happy moms .
i &apos;m saying - let &apos;s all be happy .
thank you .
can &apos;t we learn ?
can &apos;t we be brave ?
can &apos;t we believe ?
because maybe that &apos;s all we need --
a little courage ,
a little hope ,
a little belief .
she looks so lovely .
maybe there are no boundaries if we choose to not see them .
maybe love is unlimited if we &apos;re just brave enough
to decide love is limitless .
maybe there &apos;s enough happy for everyone .
i like him .
who ?
riggs .
i really like him .
i think he likes me .
or maybe ...
give me a minute .
i &apos;ll think of something .
